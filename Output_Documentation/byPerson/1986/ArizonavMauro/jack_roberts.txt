mr.
jack
roberts
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
said
that
permitting
william
carl
mauro's
wife,
at
her
insistence
and
against
the
advice
of
a
detective,
to
speak
with
him
with
an
officer
present
constituted
the
functional
equivalent
of
custodial
interrogation.
we
maintain
that
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
arizona
supreme
court
misapplied
this
court's
reasoning,
analysis
and
concerns
in
both
the
miranda
and
rhode
island
versus
innis
decisions.
when
we
hearken
back
to
innis,
it
explained
in
detail
what
miranda
meant
and
that
encompasses
this
court's
definition
of
custodial
interrogation
and
the
functional
equivalent
of
it.
we
find
that
the
court's
concerns,
as
voiced
in
innis,
were
that
the
combination
of
interrogation
and
custody
might
work
a
compulsion
upon
the
will
of
the
accused
that
might
subject
him
to
the
will
of
his
examiner
and
undermine
his
privilege
against
compulsory
self-examination.
however,
this
court
also
said
in
innis
an
important
thing
that
was
ignored
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
its
analysis
here,
and
that
was
that
interrogation
as
conceived
in
miranda
and
as
clarified
in
innis
had
to
involve
a
degree
of
compulsion,
and
that
must
be
police
compulsion,
above
that
which
is
necessarily
inherent
in
custody
itself.
now,
the
only
thing,
your
honors,
that
happened
in
this
case
was
that
linda
mauro
insisted
upon
seeing
her
husband.
the
police
acquiesced
in
that
request,
and
that
an
officer
was
present
for
valid
reasons,
the
trial
court
found,
and
the
officer
overheard
incriminating
statements
and
tape
recorded
them
with
a
tape
recorder
that
was
in
full
view,
of
which
mr.
mauro
was
aware,
and
the
trial
court
also
specifically
made
that
finding.
we
submit
that
simply
is
not
the
functional
equivalent
of
custodial
interrogation
under
this
court's
cases
under
miranda
or
under
rhode
island
versus
innis.
that
requires
an
added
degree
of
compulsion
above
that
which
is
inherent
in
custody
itself.
that
simply
is
not
present.
this
court
also
said
in
innis
that
"interrogation"
means
words
or
actions
on
the
part
of
the
police,
that
police
should
know
are
reasonably
likely
to
provoke
an
incriminating
response.
but
one
has
to
read
that
in
conjunction
with
the
other
requirement
and
the
other
part
of
the
definition
of
interrogation,
and
that
is,
it
has
to
reflect
compulsion
above
and
beyond
that
which
is
inherent
in
custody
itself.
that
simply...
that
test
is
not
made
here,
and
this
court,
reversing
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
in
innis,
noted
that
where
two
patrolmen
were
talking
in
a
patrol
car
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant
and
expressed
their
concern
about
some
child
at
a
school
for
the
handicapped
finding
the
shotgun
that
innis
had
concealed,
this
court
said
that
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
correctly
found
that
there
was
some
degree
of
subtle
compulsion
but
that
was
not
enough.
and
there,
we
have
police
doing
the
talking
right
in
the
defendant's
presence
and
the
defendant,
of
course,
in
the
back
of
the
patrol
car
was
a
captive
audience.
so,
we
submit
that
the
standard
of
innis
is
simply
not
met
in
this
case.
very
simply,
there
was
no
interrogation
within
the
meaning
of
innis,
which
clarified
miranda.
this
court
said
in
innis
also
that
not
all
statements
obtained
after
one
has
been
arrested
are
necessarily
barred
from
use
and
that
totally
volunteered
statements
do
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
we
have
cited
to
this
court
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
in
united
states
ex
rel.
church
versus
derobertis.
there,
kelly
church,
the
older
brother
of
michael
church,
asked
the
police
to
please
place
him
in
the
cell
with
his
brother
michael,
and
he
told
the
police
he
was
going
to
try
to
persuade
michael
to
confess
to
get
their
younger
brother,
casey,
out
of
trouble.
police,
knowing
kelly
was
going
to
try
to
persuade
michael
to
confess,
did
place
him
in
michael's
cell.
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
is
not
the
equivalent
of
custodial
interrogation
by
the
police
under
rhode
island
versus
innis.
mr.
jack
roberts
no,
your
honor.
i
am
simply
saying
that
the
standard
you
enunciated
there
does
not
apply
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
jack
roberts
no,
your
honor,
because
whether
or
not
it
was
interrogation
is
a
question
of
law,
and
i
am
submitting
that
as
a
question
of
law
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
wrong.
but
what
i
am
saying
was,
the
seventh
circuit
rejected
a
similar
attack
by
michael
church
in
the
case
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
the
approach
used
there
was
a
"but-for"
test,
and
i
submit
to
you
with
all
respect,
that
is
exactly
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
applied
here.
michael
church
says,
"but
for
the
police
putting
my
older
brother
in
the
cell
with
me
and
knowing
when
they
put
him
there
that
he
was
going
to
try
to
persuade
me
to
confess,
i
would
not
have
confessed.
"
well,
kelly
church
was
successful.
his
brother
later
asked
for
a
pencil
and
paper
and
wrote
out
a
confession.
here
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
said,
and
i
do
not
think
i
oversimplify,
the
police
simply
cannot
let
the
defendant's
wife
talk
to
him
even
at
her
request
and
against
their
advice
and
stand
there
and
listen.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
church
rejected
a
similar
claim
and
we
ask
this
court
to
do
the
same.
mr.
jack
roberts
i
think
it
would
be
critical,
perhaps
in
a
sixth
amendment
context,
your
honor,
but
respondent
has
conceded
at
page
9
of
her
answering
brief
and
the
arizona
supreme
court's
opinion
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
they
decided
this
on
purely
fifth
amendment
grounds.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
don't
think
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
it
would
make
any
difference,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
a
sixth
amendment
or
a
fifth
amendment
violation
because
there
was
no
interrogation.
there
was
no
compulsion
by
police.
neither
was
there
any
secrecy
or
surreptitious
interrogation.
mr.
jack
roberts
well,
if
the
right
to
counsel
had
been
invoked,
your
honor,
i
would
be
taking
precisely
the
same
position
because
what
was
it
police
did?
she
wanted
to
talk
to
her
husband.
they
allowed
her
to.
they
had
a
policeman
stationed
there
for
valid
reasons,
the
trial
court
found
after
the
suppression
hearing
even
though
the
arizona
supreme
court
did
not
mention
those
valid
reasons.
the
line
of
cases
this
court
has
decided
under
the
sixth
amendment,
massiah,
henry,
olton
versus
maine,
cases
like
that
have
been
concerned
with
surreptitious
questioning
by
an
informant
or
agent
of
the
police.
no
one
disputes
here...
it
is
conceded,
plainly
conceded,
that
linda
mauro
was
not
an
agent
or
informant
of
the
police.
yet
it
was
at
her
request,
her
idea
to
see
her
husband
and
certainly
nothing
was
done
surreptitiously.
the
testimony
of
detective
manson
at
trial
and
at
the
suppression
hearing
was
that
they
were
in
a
small
room,
captain
latham's
office.
it
has
a
few
chairs,
bookshelves,
and
captain
latham's
desk
but
no
one
was
seated
at
the
desk.
they
were
seated
in
chairs
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
detective
manson,
who
had
told
linda
mauro
she
might
see
her
husband
but
he
was
going
to
be
present
and
he
was
going
to
record
it,
sat
within
three
to
four
feet
of
mr.
mauro
with
a
tape
recorder
on
top
of
his
knee.
he
had
his
legs
crossed
and
the
tape
recorder
was
on
top
of
his
knee.
the
trial
court
specifically
found
mauro
knew
the
police
were
listening,
the
man
was
only
three
feet
from
him,
and
that
he
was
also
being
recorded.
mr.
jack
roberts
if
you
mean,
justice
o'connor,
simply
planted
it
on
her
but
all
other
circumstances
remained
the
same?
mr.
jack
roberts
i
don't
believe
it
would,
your
honor,
because
still
there
is
no
official
police
conduct.
there
is
no
compulsion
that
is
required
under
innis.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
recently
decided
a
case,
not
precisely
on
point
but
similar
in
some
respects,
the
name
of
the
case,
i
am
sorry...
kuhlman,
kuhlman
versus
wilson
where
mr.
wilson
was
placed
in
the
cell
of
an
informant,
bennie
lee.
now,
the
police
had
told
lee,
now
just
listen,
don't
try
to
stimulate
conversation
about
what
he
has
been
charged
with,
just
listen.
and
this
court
upheld
the
admission
of
statements
that
wilson
made
to
lee
on
that
basis,
and
of
course
that
was
surreptitious.
i
mean,
wilson
didn't
know
that
lee
was
a
government
informant
and
he
certainly
didn't
know
he
was
being
recorded,
and
we
don't
even
have
circumstances
like
that
here.
the
arizona
supreme
court--
mr.
jack
roberts
--he
did
invoke
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
jack
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
fifteen
minutes
previously
he
had
asked
for
counsel.
police
had
ceased
questioning
him.
mr.
jack
roberts
that's
correct,
your
honor,
fifteen
minutes
before
this,
and
police
ceased
questioning.
they
asked
him
nothing
after
he
invoked
counsel
at
10:45.
this
brief
exchange
between
himself
and
his
wife
occurred
at
approximately
11:00
o'clock,
15
minutes
later.
mr.
jack
roberts
i
think,
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
closer
case
because
then
you
have
the
idea--
mr.
jack
roberts
--yes,
originating
with
the
police,
and
they
are
trying
to
get
the
brother
to
do
something
for
them.
but
those
aren't
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
arizona
supreme
court
further
held,
and
we
submit
most
erroneously,
that
the
state
could
not
even
use
this
brief
tape
in
rebuttal,
and
in
so
doing
it
relied
upon
this
court's
holding
in
wainwright
versus
greenfield.
we
submit
that
was
grievous
error
because
this
tape
was
used
only
in
rebuttal.
the
trial
court's
findings,
which
i
urge
you
to
scrutinize,
are
at
pages
216
through
220
of
the
joint
appendices,
and
he
made
very
complete
and
specific
findings
on
all
of
these
matters.
the
trial
court
held
that...
well,
first
let
me
set
the
stage.
let
me
tell
you
what
defense
counsel
had
done
in
building
the
insanity
defense.
first
of
all,
this
tape
was
not
needed
and
certainly
was
not
used
to
prove
that
mr.
mauro
committed
the
murder.
he
admitted
that
to
numerous
people
at
a
circle-k
shortly
after
he
had
done
it.
it
wasn't
needed
to
prove
the
act.
all
it
was
needed
for
was
to
show
his
mental
state
to
rebut
his
insanity
defense.
what
defense
counsel
had
done
was
to
put
on
the
stand
bruce
griffin,
a
defense
attorney,
who
say
mr.
mauro
the
day
of
the
murder,
november
23rd,
1982,
but
he
saw
him
later
in
the
day
after
mauro
had
talked
with
his
wife,
later
in
the
day.
everything
the
defense
counsel
presented
on
the
day
of
the
murder,
so
far
as
the
conversations,
or
later
in
the
day
after
the
tape
between
mauro
and
his
wife.
mr.
griffin
described
mr.
mauro,
and
i
summarize
but
fairly,
as
a
salivating
or
slobbering
catatonic
madman.
that
was
the
gist
of
his
description.
then,
relying
upon
their
psychiatrist,
the
defense
psychiatrist,
dean
gerstenburger,
mr.
gerstenburger
also
observed
mauro
later
in
the
day,
even
later
than
mr.
griffin
observed
him.
gerstenburger
got
in
a
good
many
hearsay
statements
from
mr.
mauro
in
his
response.
but
more
important
than
that,
gerstenburger
relied
upon
a
tape
recording,
exhibit
172,
which
was
admitted
at
defense
counsel's
request,
a
tape
recording
between
another
defense
attorney,
donald
bayliss,
and
mr.
mauro.
now,
your
honors,
what
is
so
important
to
realize
about
this,
and
i
know
you
have
either
heard
the
tape
or
you
will,
is
when
you
hear
mr.
bayliss
asking
mr.
mauro
questions,
and
this
is
on
the
day
of
the
murder
but
later
than
the
conversation
between
mauro
and
his
wife,
when
you
hear
bayliss
asking
him
questions
what
you
hear
in
response
from
mauro,
and
that's
why
defense
counsel
wanted
it
before
the
jury,
is
unintelligible
animal-like
sounds
more
similar
to
grunting
and
moans
than
anything
else,
thus
portraying
him
to
the
jury
as
an
incoherent,
irrational
person
sounding
more
like
an
animal
than
anything
else.
mr.
jack
roberts
oh,
they
initially
and
exclusively
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
jack
roberts
they
initially
and
exclusively
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
this
court's
holding.
mr.
jack
roberts
in
greenfield,
you
mean,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
roberts
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
they
cited
no
arizona
cases
and
no
arizona
rules
of
evidence
and
no
arizona
law
for
not
allowing
this
in
as
rebuttal.
they
relied
exclusively
on
this
court's
decision
in
greenfield.
had
they
had
some
arizona
law
or
some
arizona
rule
of
evidence
they
wished
to
rely
upon,
they
would
have
but
they
did
not.
they
relied
upon
this
court's
decision.
mr.
jack
roberts
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
should
be
decided
and
reversed
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
interrogation.
i
agree.
but
what
i
am
saying
is,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that,
our
position
is
that
it
was
not
fundamentally
unfair
to
allow
the
prosecutor
to
use
this
brief
exchange
between
mauro
and
his
wife
to
show
several
things.
that
is
the
reason
we
present
that
argument
also.
the
trial
court
found
it
was
probative,
the
most
probative
and
relevant
thing
that
the
prosecutor
could
present
in
rebuttal
for
the
following
reasons,
and
please
let
me
apprise
you
of
those.
number
one,
it
showed
more
plainly
than
anything
else
that
prosecution
could
present
mauro's
state
of
mind
closest
to
the
time
he
committed
the
murder.
the
tape
between
mauro
and
his
wife
was
the
closest
thing
to
the
time
he
committed
the
murder.
defense
counsel,
in
a
lengthy
cross
examination
of
linda
mauro
who
was
on
the
stand
at
least
three
days,
had
also
through
that
examination
and
through
eight
pages
he
devoted
in
closing
argument,
attempted
to
portray
her
to
the
jury
as
being
at
least
partially,
if
not
wholly
responsible
for
the
child's
brutal
murder
by
suffocation.
having
done
that,
the
trial
court
concluded,
it
was
legitimate
and
not
fundamentally
unfair
to
allow
the
prosecutor
to
let
the
jury
hear
the
tape
where
they
could
hear
mauro's
voice,
judge
for
themselves
his
thinking,
his
intimations,
his
pauses,
and
hear
his
wife's
voice
because
of
the
accusations
and
implications
that
defense
counsel
had
been
making
against
her.
it
was
a
most
effective
thing.
the
key
question
here--
mr.
jack
roberts
--the
relevance
of
hearing
his
wife,
your
honor,
was
that
defense
counsel
had
attempted
to
portray
his
wife
as
responsible
for
the
murder.
this
tape--
mr.
jack
roberts
--well,
if
when
you
read--
mr.
jack
roberts
--no,
no--
mr.
jack
roberts
--no,
your
honor.
no,
that
wasn't
the
purpose
for
which
the
state
offered
it.
the
state
offered
it
to
rebut
his
claim
of
insanity.
mr.
jack
roberts
well,
the
trial
court
held
that
both
were
important,
your
honor,
because
you
can't,
on
a
piece
of
paper
you
can't
get
intonations
and
pauses.
that
was
simply
one
of
the
trial
court's
findings.
mr.
jack
roberts
oh,
yes,
i
agree
with
that,
and
that
was
simply
one
reason
the
trial
court
gave,
but
you
are
correct,
justice
stevens.
the
primary
reason
the
state
introduced
it
was
to
rebut
this
insanity
defense.
i
am
merely
saying
the
trial
court
found
additional
reasons
to
allow
it
also,
and
of
course
the
nature
of
what
mauro
said
in
that
very
brief
exchange
shows
better
than
anyone
could
that
the
man
was
rational,
at
least
at
that
time
that
he
spoke
to
his
wife
and
something
else--
mr.
jack
roberts
--no,
your
honor.
they
said,
we'll
let
you
do
something
but
not
the
same
thing
and
not
as
effective,
and
what
we'll
let
you
do
is
put
carefully
framed
questions
to
the
witnesses
so
they
can
describe
his
general
demeanor
and
whether
or
not
he
was
generally
able
to
speak
rationally.
well,
of
course
that's
fine
because
defense
counsel--
mr.
jack
roberts
--i
don't...
well,
perhaps
we
read
the
opinion
differently
at
that
point
your
honor.
certainly
they
said
you
can't
make
specific
reference
to
this
conversation.
mr.
jack
roberts
you
can't
quote
it.
now,
perhaps
you
could
have
said,
well,
did
what
he
said
seem
to
be
rational.
but
the
effect
of
that
is
what,
when
the
jury
has
before
it
a
defense
tape
where
they
hear
him
moaning
and
groaning
like
an
animal
in
response
to
mr.
bayliss's
questions.
mr.
jack
roberts
certainly
we
could
have
done
that,
your
honor,
but
it
would
not
have
been
as
effective.
what
i
was
about
to
point
out
here
is
that
a
significant
distinction
between
this
case
and
greenfield
also
is
that
greenfield
invoked
his
own
miranda
rights
and
this
court
found
it
fundamentally
unfair
because
of
the
implicit
assurance
in
miranda
to
later
let
the
prosecutor
impeach
him
with
that,
which
the
prosecutor
did
in
his
case
in
chief,
incidentally.
so,
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
person
relying
on
his
own
miranda
rights.
there
was
no
ambiguity
of
silence,
which
this
court
said
could
unfairly
penalize
an
innocent
person
because
as
the
court
pointed
out,
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
may
invoke
the
right
to
silence
and
the
right
to
consult
with
counsel.
mr.
jack
roberts
fifteen
minutes
earlier,
your
honor,
but
no
testimony
about
that.
mr.
jack
roberts
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
not
in
the
exchange
with
his
wife.
in
the
exchange
with
his
wife
he
told
her
to
shut
up
and
get
an
attorney.
he
didn't
rely
on
his
miranda
rights.
mr.
jack
roberts
okay.
your
honor,
there's
two
conversations
involved.
there
was
one
at
10:45,
15
minutes
before
the
tape--
mr.
jack
roberts
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
nobody
ever
gave
any
testimony
about
that,
about
his
invoking
his
right
to
remain
silent.
that
wasn't
given.
the
tape
15
minutes
earlier
when
his
wife
saw
him,
there
he
doesn't
rely
on
his
rights.
he
doesn't
invoke
his
rights.
he
says,
"you
shut
up.
"
"you
can
get
a
public
attorney,
get
one.
"
that's
not
greenfield.
he
is
telling
somebody
else.
mr.
jack
roberts
yes,
your
honor,
but
going
back
to
the
first
point,
and
as
i
have
argued
it
is
not
interrogation.
mr.
jack
roberts
that's
true.
but
i
don't
see
how--
mr.
jack
roberts
--what
i
am
saying
is,
he
did
not
invoke
his
miranda
rights.
he
told
her
to
use
her
miranda
rights.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
well,
that's
a
distinction
from
greenfield.
greenfield
invoked
his
own
rights.
mr.
jack
roberts
we
have
also
cited
to
this
court
the
case
of
nichols
versus
wainwright,
and
there
the
eleventh
circuit
did
not
find
it
impermissible
for
the
prosecutor
to
use
as
impeachment
a
statement
that
the
defendant
made
one-half
hour
after
his
arrest.
now,
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
nichols
had
invoked
his
miranda
rights,
right
to
remain
silent,
the
right
to
have
counsel.
he
invoked
that,
but
a
half-hour
later
he
made
a
statement
saying
that
he
did
what
he
did
because
of
duress.
well,
nichols
didn't
even
take
the
stand
as
mauro
did
not
take
the
stand.
but
his
defense
attorney
was
able
to
get
in
that
testimony
though
another
witness,
through
a
police
officer
who
said
that,
"yes,
he
told
me
he
did
what
he
did
because
of
duress.
"
now,
the
eleventh
circuit
said
there
is
nothing
in
greenfield...
or
doyle
versus
ohio,
that
prohibits
this
use
of
it
because
what
this
man
did
was
rely
on
his
miranda
rights,
but
then
he
argued...
his
defense
attorney
argued
and
got
in
evidence
that
something
he
did
post-miranda
warning,
when
he
made
his
statement
about
duress,
proved
his
innocence,
and
they
said,
when
you
are
going
to
use
post-miranda
statements
like
that,
and
specifically
rely
on
their
proximity
in
time
to
your
arrest
for
your
defense,
then
we
don't
believe
greenfield
or
doyle
prohibits
the
prosecution
from
impeaching
you
with
even
the
defendant's
own
prior
silence.
this
court
has
said,
and
even
if
the
court
should
disagree
about
there
being
a
fifth
amendment
violation,
this
court
has
said
in
cases
such
as
harris
versus
new
york
and
oregon
versus
haas,
that
even
where
a
fifth
amendment
violation
has
occurred,
and
we
submit
one
did
not
here,
that
that
does
not
mean
the
state
is
forever
prohibited
from
using
the
evidence
in
any
fashion
thereafter.
the
court
will
well
recall
that
those
cases
involved
absence
of
miranda
warnings,
or
proper
miranda
warnings.
defendants
who
took
the
stand
and
then
were
impeached
with
prior
inconsistent
statements
because
they
were
voluntary...
and
let
me
point
out
here,
there
has
never
been
any
question
that
mauro's
brief
comments
to
his
wife
were
voluntary.
the
trial
court
so
specifically
found,
and
i
point
out,
dr.
gerstenburger,
the
defense
psychiatrist,
himself
said
that
the
comments
were
voluntary
and
that
they
showed
that
at
that
moment
that
mauro
made
them,
he
was
much
more
in
touch
with
reality
than
he
was
at
the
times
later
in
the
day.
why
was
that
important?
dr.
gerstenburger
testified
that
mauro
fluctuated
in
and
out,
in
and
out
of
reality
for
three
weeks
prior
to
the
day
he
committed
the
murder.
so,
as
the
trial
court
noted,
it
was
extremely
probative
and
relevant
for
the
jury
to
hear
this
short
tape
between
him
and
his
wife
to
see
how
much
in
touch
with
reality
he
was,
with
reality
he
was,
at
the
time
closest
to
the
murder.
but
in
any
case,
in
harris
versus
new
york
and
in
other
cases,
this
court
has
said
as
long
as
the
statements
are
voluntary,
and
they
were
here,
and
the
trial
court
made
a
separate
finding
they
were
voluntary,
knowing
and
intelligent,
he
made
a
separate
finding
on
all
three
prongs,
that
they
may
be
used
in
impeachment.
that
is
precisely
what
was
done
here
and
we
submit
there
was
nothing...
we
submit,
number
one--
mr.
jack
roberts
--yes,
it
was
impeachment
of
the
defendant
who
took
the
stand,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
roberts
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
roberts
no,
the
one
we
had
is,
we
were
impeaching
defense
evidence
that
he
was
simply
a
babbling
animal
later
in
the
day.
mr.
jack
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
the
nichols
case,
decided
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand
either.
but
the
statement
came
in,
nonetheless.
and
the
eleventh
circuit
was
considering
this
court's
holdings
in
greenfield
and
doyle.
you
are
quite
right,
your
honor,
the
circumstances
and
the
rationale
are
different.
but
what
i
am
saying,
i
don't
see
anything
fundamentally
unfair,
and
of
course
i
am
analogizing
the
circumstances...
i
am
analogizing
to
harris
versus
new
york
and
oregon
versus
haas,
and
saying
that,
keeping
in
mind
the
concerns
this
court
voiced
there,
because
i
believe,
if
i
am
not
incorrect,
i
believe
it
was
justice
blackmun
who
said
in
oregon
versus
haas,
"we
are,
after
all,
engaged
in
a
search
for
truth
in
a
criminal
trial,
so
long
as
that
search
is
properly
surrounded
by
the
proper
constitutional--
"
mr.
jack
roberts
--yes,
your
honor,
they
could
use
that
in
their
opinions,
but
the
defense
still
has
the
benefit
of
showing
the
defendant
as
an
unintelligible
person
making
animal-like
sounds,
with
the
tape,
a
live
tape
they
can
play
to
the
jury,
and
that's
the
impression
the
jury
has
the
rest
of
the
day.
there's
nothing
to
counter
that.
mr.
jack
roberts
no,
i
am
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
the
best
rebuttal.
mr.
jack
roberts
that
is
true,
it
would,
your
honor.
but
it
would
not
have
been
the
most
effective
rebuttal.
our
position
is,
your
honor,
number
one,
that
there
was
simply
no
interrogation
under
this
court's
definition
in
miranda
and
innis,
and
even
if
there
was,
there
was
nothing
fundamentally
unfair
in
allowing
this
to
be
used
simply
in
rebuttal.
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
jack
roberts
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
a
little
bit
late,
your
honor,
for
respondent
to
be
arguing
an
edwards
issue
because
the
arizona
supreme
court
plainly
decided
this
on
the
basis
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
miranda
and
rhode
island
versus
innis.
mr.
jack
roberts
that
was
the
basis
of
the
arizona
supreme
court's
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
roberts
that
was
the
basis
of
the
arizona
supreme
court's
decision,
not
edwards.
mr.
jack
roberts
all
right,
your
honor.
in
response
to
that
edwards
requires
that
police
initiate
contact.
mr.
jack
roberts
yes,
i
think
i
would
agree
with
that
hypothetical,
your
honor.
but
that's
not
what
happened.
mr.
jack
roberts
probably
the
same
result.
that
also
is
not
what
happened.
mr.
jack
roberts
well,
you
have
no
police
initiation
of
anything
here,
your
honor.
you
just
have
them
allowing
his
wife
to
see
him,
and
that's
the--
mr.
jack
roberts
--a
much
closer
and
much
tougher--
mr.
jack
roberts
--well,
because
there
you
at
least
have
the
police
initiating...
encouraging
the
wife.
mr.
jack
roberts
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
jack
roberts
but
the
other
point
i
was
going
to
make
is,
mrs.
walsh
is
perfectly
correct,
the
trial
judge
did
say
in
his
findings
at
pages
218
and
219
of
the
joint
appendix
that
they
were
both
told,
that
is,
linda
mauro
and
her
husband,
that
they
were
being
recorded.
actually,
detective
manson,
to
keep
the
record
straight,
only
told
linda
mauro
that.
but
the
answer
to
that
is,
it
was
obvious
when
mrs.
mauro
walked
in
the
room,
all
mr.
mauro
had
to
say
was,
"get
out.
"
"i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.
"
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
look
at
his
last
response
in
this
brief
exchange,
that's
what
he
finally
told
her,
"don't
talk
to
me.
"
that's
what
showed
he
was
so
rational.
he
didn't
refuse
to
see
his
wife.
let
me
point
that
out.
it's
not
like
edwards
where
the
jailer
came
and
said,
there's
some
police
here
who
want
to
talk
to
you,
and
edwards
says,
"no,
i
don't
want
to.
"
the
jailer
tells
him,
"you've
got
to",
and
then
edwards
talks
to
them.
that's
not
the
case.
he
didn't
have
to
talk
to
his
wife.
he
could
have
kept
his
mouth
shut.
the
trial
court
made
that
common
sense
observation
also.
he
chose
not
to.
he
never
said,
"i
don't
want
to
see
my
wife,
get
out
of
here.
"
he
talked
to
her.
and
all
the
police
did
was
stand
there
and
listen.
it
simply
does
not
meet
this
court's
requirements
under
innis
or
miranda,
and
we
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
reverse.
