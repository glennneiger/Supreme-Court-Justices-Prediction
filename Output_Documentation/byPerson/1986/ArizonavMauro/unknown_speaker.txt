unknown
speaker
so,
any
demonstration
of
sanity
while
he
is
at
the
police
station
constitutes
incrimination
and
the
police
cannot
do
anything
to
him
or
with
him
while
he
is
at
the
station
that
might
let
him
show
that
he
is
sane?
that's
rather
an
extreme
position,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
would
agree
with
you
if
they
tried
to
introduce
it
to
show
that
he
said
he
had
committed
it,
yes.
but
all
they
are
introducing
it
for
is
to
show
that
he
was
sane,
that's
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
then
have
to
be
very
careful
about
talking
to
any
prisoner
who
is
in
custody
if
you
think
he
is
going
to
be
raising
an
insanity
defense.
you
can't
talk
to
him
about
anything.
unknown
speaker
because
as
you
say,
it's
not
just
the
recording
of
it.
the
recorder
didn't
matter.
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
testify
that
the
man
seemed
to
be
rational.
you
really
have
to
keep
him
incommunicado.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
talk
about
provoking
a
demonstration
of
rationality.
one
can
provoke
a
confession,
yes,
i
committed
the
crime.
but
here
you
are
talking
about
provoking
a
demonstration
of
rationality
and
that
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
concept.
unknown
speaker
supposing
that
i
am...
let's
take
this
in
a
classic
fifth
amendment
context.
supposing
i
am
called
before
a
committee
of
congress
and
they
begin
to
interrogate
me,
and
they
say,
"what's
your
name",
and
i
say,
"i
decline
to
testify
on
the
ground
that
it
might
incriminate
me.
"
and
the
person
asking
the
question
says,
"well,
it's
always
been
held
that
you
have
to
answer
your
name
and
address.
"
"you
have
to
get
to
something
actually
incriminating.
"
and
i
say,
"no,
if
i
give
my
name
it
might
prove
that
i
am
rational
and
therefore.
"
--now,
you
wouldn't
think
that
would
be
a
permissible
basis
for
invoking
the
fifth
amendment
before
a
committee,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
why
does
it
make
any
difference
here
then,
if
miranda
is
designed
to
secure
the
fifth
amendment
rights?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
perfectly
permissible,
if
they
want
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
arizona
law.
but
what
they
did
here,
they
said
the
federal
constitution
prevents
them
from
doing
it.
i
mean,
it's
not
enough
just
that
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
doesn't
approve
of
the
behavior
of
the
police
department,
to
sustain
a
federal
constitutional
challenge.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
if
the
wife
came
to
visit
her
husband
and
the
police
said,
fine,
go
ahead,
and
no
policeman
was
present,
no
recording
device,
and
the
lady
talked
with
her
husband
and
came
back
and
then
she
said,
"i
want
to
tell
you
what
my
husband
said.
"
and
she
told
them
and
it
was
quite
incriminating,
and
she
says,
"sure,
i'll
testify
to
it.
"
would
that
be
a
violation
of
miranda
rights,
just
because
the
police
permitted
the
wife
to
talk?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
police
let
the
lady
in
and
they
gave
her
permission
and
they
thought
to
themselves,
well,
he
may
make
some
incriminating
statements
and
she
may
tell
us?
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
the
police
presence,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
in
our
cases
that
indicates
that
that
should...
that
the
case
should
turn
on
that
kind
of
a
factor?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
more
interested
in
whether
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
violation
at
all,
and
i
don't
see
that
there
is.
i'm
trying
to
understand
from
you
what
makes
it
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
granted
the
defendant's
wife's
request
to
talk
to
him?
unknown
speaker
and
sat
there
in
plain
view
while
she
did
so?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
is
coercion?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
think
that
edwards
means
that
the
police
could
not
permit
the
wife
to
see
him?
unknown
speaker
this
was
beknownst
to
the
husband.
unknown
speaker
did
he
ask
to
see
his
wife?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
the
attorney
general
said
he
did.
unknown
speaker
ms.
walsh,
let
me
just
see
if
i
understand
your
theory.
you
are
saying
that
he
had
invoked
his
right
to
counsel,
and
under
edwards
the
police
cannot
initiate
interrogation,
and
so
that
if
the
police
officer
had
walked
in
unannounced
with
the
wife
and
said
to
the
man,
"will
you
please
tell
your
wife
everything
i've
been
asking
you.
"
that
would
have
been
clearly
impermissible.
or
if
he
had
said,
"i
hope
you'll
talk
to
your
wife
while
i
sit
here
and
listen.
"
that
would
be
closer,
and
you
are
saying
it
is
just
the
functional
equivalent
if
he
just
walks
in
and
just
sits
down
and
listens,
that
they
all
boil
down
to
the
same
thing?
that
is
your
position,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
it's
just
as
much
interrogation
if
he
implicitly
says,
"i'd
like
you
to
talk
to
this
lady.
"
as
if
he
says,
"please
do"?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that?
unknown
speaker
because
what?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
edwards
is
clearly
relevant
because
that's
what
imposed
the
obstacle
to
the
police
interrogation,
that
he
would
ask
for
his...
you
know,
he
invoked
edwards.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
would
you
agree
with
my
hypothetical,
if
they
walked
in
together
unannounced
and
the
police
officer
said
to
the
man,
"would
you
please
tell
your
wife
the
answer
to
the
questions
i
have
been
asking?
"
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
but
if
he
just
said,
"would
you
please
talk
to
your
wife
and
tell
her
everything
you
can
remember?
"
unknown
speaker
as
soon
as
you
take
away
the
question
mark,
then
it's
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
police
officer
had
brought
her
to
the
station...
she
hadn't
asked
it...
and
said,
"we
would
like
you
to
go
in
and
talk
to
your
husband
and
we
would
like
to
listen.
"
and
that's
all
they
said
to
her
and
then
they
walked
in
exactly
as
they
did?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
answer?
if
they
say
nothing
in
his
presence,
other
than
what
they
said
here,
why
is
that
a
hard
case
at
all
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
the
difference
between
the
two
cases
is
that
in
this
case
she
asked
for
and
they
initially
turned
her
down,
and
then
he
talked
to
his
boss
and
the
boss
said,
"no,
take
her
in
there.
"
it
would
have
been
different
if
the
boss
had
in
the
first
instance
said,
"go
get
her
and
take
her
in
there?
"
that
would
be
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
okay.
