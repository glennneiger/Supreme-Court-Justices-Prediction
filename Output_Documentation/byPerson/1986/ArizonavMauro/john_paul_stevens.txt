mr.
roberts,
can
i
just
refresh
my
recollection.
justice
white
asked
you
if
it
would
make
any
difference
if
there
had
been
an
invocation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
he
did,
yes.
i
see.
so
that
it
is
a
case
in
which
he
had
already
asked
for
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess,
i
am
a
little
puzzled.
what
is
the
relevance
of
his
wife's
voice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
still
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
was
offered
in
evidence
to
show
that
his
wife
was
not
responsible
for
the
murder?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
rebut
the
claim
of
insanity
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
arizona
supreme
court's
response
to
this
argument?
didn't
they
say,
you
could
have
done
the
same
thing
without
listening
to
the
tape?
justice
john
paul
stevens
generally,
and
in
this
particular
case
too.
i
mean,
in
this
particular
interview,
that
you
could
have
described
the
manner
in
which
he
talked.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can't
quote
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
couldn't
have
testified
he
was
not
moaning
and
groaning
like
an
animal
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
was
invoking
his
own
miranda
rights
when
he
said
he
wanted
a
lawyer
before
he
testified,
wasn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
to
the
extent
he
invoked
miranda
rights,
they
were
his
own
miranda
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean,
he
didn't
ask
her
for
warnings
before
he
spoke
to
her?
i
don't
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
he
involved
his--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
the
question,
as
i
understand,
is
whether
the
previous
invocation
of
miranda
rights,
and
asking
for
a
lawyer,
tainted
this
conversation
because
he
wasn't
given
a
lawyer,
and
the
question
is
whether
this
was
interrogation
or
not.
isn't
that
the
whole
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
point.
of
course,
if
one...
if
you
take
the
view
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
he
adequately
invoked
his
miranda
rights
and
he
wins.
if
you
disagree
with
him
on
interrogation,
he
loses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
the
invoking
miranda
rights
in
conversation
with
his
wife.
i'm
just
kind
of
puzzled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
a
lot
of
distinctions
from
greenfield.
i
just
don't
understand
what
they've
got
to
do
with
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
correct,
though,
that
in
this
case
the
tape
was...
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
it
would
be
all
right
to
use
the
tape,
to
play
it
to
the
psychiatrist
who
could
then
testify
by
interpreting
this,
as
to
how
rational--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
wouldn't
treat
it
as
countervailing
evidence
that
a
psychiatrist
said,
"well,
i
listened
to
him
at
this
particular
time
and
he
was
perfectly
rational.
"
you
mean,
they
just
wouldn't
believe
the
psychiatrist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
certainly
would
show
that
he
did
not
always
talk
in
the
way
in
which
he
was
recorded
on
one
particular
point
in
time.
