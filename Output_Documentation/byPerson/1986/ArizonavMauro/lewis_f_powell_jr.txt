didn't
the
trial
court
find
that
the
defendant
did
know,
was
told
that
the
conversation
would
be
taped?

there
is
a
conflict
between
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
found
and
what
the
trial
court
found?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
tape
recorder
was
in
plain
view,
that's
not
debated,
is
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
agree,
i
suppose,
that
the
tape
recorder
would
perhaps
be
more
influential
with
the
jury
than
the
verbal
testimony
of
a
police
officer?
