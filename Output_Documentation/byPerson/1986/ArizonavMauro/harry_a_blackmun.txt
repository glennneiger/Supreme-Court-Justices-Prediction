mr.
roberts,
are
you
asking
that
we
cut
back
on
rhode
island
against
innis?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
think
this
is
just
a
fact
bound
application
of
innis?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--mr.
roberts,
let
me
ask
you
something.
do
you
think
the
arizona
court
initially
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
say
it
again?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
isn't
all
the
talk
about
the
sixth
amendment
in
greenholtz
just
pure
dicta?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
doesn't
that
defeat
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
can't
get
away
from
the
fact
that
this
is
just
a
pure
factual
application
of
the
innis
case,
and
all
your
talk
about
greenfield
and
the
sixth
amendment
is
rather
by
the
way.
