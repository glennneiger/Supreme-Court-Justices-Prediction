justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
her
voice,
it's
what
she
said,
you
mean?
it
wasn't
her
voice?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
him
the
tape
was
important
because
the
mere
tone
and
everything
was
important,
but
for
her
it
was
what
she
said
that
was
important
to
the
jury,
right,
that
it
was
clear
she
hadn't
had
anything
to
do
with
the
murder?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
impeachment
of
what
in
both
of
those
cases?
was
it
impeachment
of
live
trial
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
showing
that
he
was
perjuring
himself?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
the
case
here,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
little
different
thing
from
saying,
we're
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
in
order
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
trial
system,
if
somebody
tries
to
perjure
himself
at
trial,
we'll
let
it
in.
but
this
is
just...
you're
really
saying
to
refute
anything
that
can
come
in?
the
whole
trial
is
just
a
refutation
of
things,
isn't
it?
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
i
can
see
the
line
between
allowing
it
in
to
prevent
perjury
and
others,
but
i
don't
see
the
line
you're
drawing.
so
long
as
you're
refuting
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
tried
to
talk
her
out
of
it,
didn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
necessary
that
more
than
one
of
them
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
not
only
didn't
they
instigate
it,
but
they
tried
to
talk
her
out
of
it.
they
did
try
to
talk
her...
well,
the
original
police
officer
tried
to
talk
her
out
of
it
because
she
was
emotionally
upset.
however,
when
he
went
in
to
his
supervisor,
his
supervisor
said,
"sure,
i
don't
see
a
problem.
"
"you
go
in,
you
listen,
you
take
a
tape
recorder
in
with
you.
"
i
think
that
this
whole
issue
of
control
was
what
struck
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
defining
that
this
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
custodial
interrogation.
you
have
bill
mauro
who
is
sitting
there,
not
knowing
what's
going
on,
necessarily.
he
doesn't
know
his
wife
is
going
to
come
in.
he
doesn't
know
the
police
officer
is
going
to
be
tape
recording
this
conversation.
may
i
interrupt
you,
counsel,
at
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
assert
here,
and
i
guess
you
have
to
assert,
that
the
mere
demonstration
that
you
are
rational
constitutes
an
incriminating
statement.
i
mean,
it
wasn't
the
substance
of
anything
he
said
that
showed
him
to
be
guilty
of
a
crime,
it
was
just
the
fact
that
he
was
rational?
now,
there
are
just
a
million
things
the
police
could
do
that
would
produce
that
result,
just
walking
in
with
his
breakfast
and
saying,
"here's
your
breakfast.
"
"how
are
you
feeling
this
morning?
"
and
he
says,
"well,
i'm
fine.
"
"how
are
you?
"
now,
the
police
are
not
allowed
to
do
that
either,
because
that
is
causing
him
to
incriminate
himself?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then,
what's
wrong
with
what
happened
here?
i
mean,
what
was
introduced
was
not
that
he
blurted
out,
"yes,
i
did
it",
and
they
are
introducing
that
at
the
trial.
the
only
thing
they
are
introducing
is
the
fact
that
the
man
was
rational.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
that
wasn't
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
allowed
to
be
introduced?
