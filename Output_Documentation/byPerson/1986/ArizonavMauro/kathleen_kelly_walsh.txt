ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
agree
with
what
justice
blackmun
was
saying,
that
perhaps
this
is
just
merely
a
case
of
factual
application
of
rhode
island
versus
innis
to
the
situation
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
chose
to
find
that
the
activity
of
the
police
department
in
flagstaff,
arizona
was
nothing
more
than
the
functional
equivalent
of
custodial
interrogation.
this
court
in
rhose
island
versus
innis
defined
the
functional
equivalent
of
custodial
interrogation
as
being
specifically
any
activity
that
the
police
engage
in,
in
which
they
know
that
incriminating
statements
were
likely
to
be
made.
here
you
have
an
absolutely
clear
case.
the
police
knew
that
incriminating
statements
were
likely
to
be
made.
in
fact,
two
of
the
police
officers
indicated
specifically
that
they
knew
that
linda
mauro
may
have
been
involved
in
the
crime
itself
and
they
were
somewhat
in
the
dark
about
it,
or
they
were
afraid
that
bill
and
linda
mauro
might
concoct
their
stories
or
might
try
and
get
their
stories--
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
--yes,
it
does.
it
does
involve
more
than
just
knowing.
it
also
involves
some
type
of
activity,
some
sort
of
active
role
such
as
allowing
this
conversation
to
commence.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
disagree
specifically
with
that
because
the
police
department
controlled
whether
or
not
the
conversation
took
place.
you
have
to
look
at
the
scenario.
the
police
said
to
linda
mauro,
you
may
speak
to
your
husband
but
you
will
be
taped
and
we
will
be
present.
now,
take
a
step
back
into
bill
mauro's
shoes.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
one
of
them
did,
but
the
supervisor
said
no.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
pardon?
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
yes,
justice.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
the
trial
court
did
say
that.
however,
the
evidence
and
the
testimony
from
all
three
of
the
police
officers
who
testified
was
that
no,
he
did
not
know,
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
did
find
that,
no,
he
did
not
know.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
yes,
i
believe
so.
he
did
not
know
that
the
wife
was
coming
in.
they
just
came
into
the
room.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
no,
that
is
not
debated.
in
fact,
the
presence
of
the
tape
recorder
is
not
necessarily
relevant.
the
same
result
would
occur
if
it
were
the
police
officer
testifying
as
to
the
conversation
itself,
or
whether
a
tape
recording
was
actually
admitted.
i
don't
believe
that
the
tape
recording
in
and
of
itself
is
the
operative
factor
here.
i
think
the
fact
that
the
police
officer
was
in
the
room,
listening
to
this
conversation,
he
was
not
told
that
this
conversation
would
take
place.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
i
would
agree
with
that.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
well,
i
believe
that
the
trial
court
found
that
mr.
mauro
knew
that
his
wife
was
coming
in
and
knew
that
the
police
officer
was
going
to
record
the
conversation.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
yes,
but
i
would
submit
that
that
is
a
highly
coercive
situation.
she
is
hysterical
and
the
tape
bears
this
out.
she
is
crying.
she
is
sobbing.
he
has
not
seen
his
wife
since
he
left
the
house.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
i
would
agree
that
it
has
to
be
coercive
in
that
situation,
yes.
but
i
believe
that
the
police,
going
into
the
room
with
the
wife
who
is
hysterical,
the
police
officer
testified
that
she
was
upset,
in
fact,
that's
why
he
didn't
want
her
going
in
there,
that
allowing
her
to
go
in
and
listening
to
the
conversation
they
knew
that
it
was
likely
that
there
would
be
incriminating
statements
made.
it's
like
the
excited
utterance
exception
to
the
evidentiary
laws.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
but
i
think
the
police
did
produce
the
coercion
by
allowing
the
two
to
get
together.
i
think
that
it's
a
highly
coercive
situation,
when
you
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case.
a
child
is
dead.
they
have
not
seen
each
other
since
he
left
the
house
with
the
suitcase.
she
is
an
emotional
wreck
at
this
point
in
time,
and
because
of
that,
of
course,
it's
coercive.
of
course,
like
an
excited
utterance,
you
can
expect
that
somebody
is
going
to
say
something,
and
they're
not
going
to
be
thinking
about
preserving
their
miranda
rights
in
this
situation.
this
court,
in
rhode
island
versus
innis,
also
touched
upon
the
fact
that
incriminating
statements
specifically
include
any
statements
introduced,
whether
they
are
inculpatory
or
exculpatory,
as
long
as
they
are
produced
by
the
prosecution.
i
think
it's
not
necessarily
relevant
that
these
statements
were
admitted
in
rebuttal
as
opposed
to
admitted
in
the
case
in
chief,
because
they
were
inculpatory
and
they
were
admitted
on
behalf
of
the
prosecution
to
show
the
evidence
of
sanity.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
no.
the
brief
exchange
was--
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
miranda
requires
questions
in
and
of
itself.
i
think
that
rhode
island
versus
innis
touched
on
that
in
defining
the
functional
equivalent.
you
don't
need
to
necessarily
ask
the
questions.
i
think
miranda
does
not
require
specifically
that
questions
be
asked.
i
think
it's
the
coercive
police
activity
that
you
find
that.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
no,
because
i
think
as
this
court
has
mentioned,
there
is
contact
between
a
defendant
and
police,
jailers,
at
all
times,
that
that
could
produce
that
kind
of
conversation.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
first
of
all,
he
did
blurt
out,
"yes,
i
did
it.
"
"you
tried
as
best
you
can
to
stop
me.
"
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
introduced
in
order
to
rebut
the
insanity
defense.
but
first
of
all
it
is
up
to
the
prosecution
to
prove
sanity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
that
would
be
an
extreme
position,
but
i
think
that
what
happens
here
is
that
the
police
officers
brought
the
husband
and
the
wife
together
specifically
to
create
a
situation
where
incriminating
statements
might
be
made,
and
it--
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
--i
think
the
problem
with
that
is
that
if
you
give
the
fact
that
these
are
miranda
violative
statements,
you
can't
say
that
miranda
is...
that
if
you
have
a
miranda
violative
situation
and
you
raise
the
insanity
defense,
you
waive
your
miranda
rights
or
any
other
rights
protected
by
the
constitution.
what
you
would
be
saying
is
that,
of
course
they
couldn't
introduce
these
statements
otherwise,
but
if
you
invoke
the
insanity
defense
then
indeed
you
are
waiving
your
right
to
exclude
miranda
violative
statements.
i
would
submit
that
that
would
be
an
unfair
result
and
an
unfair
burden
to
legitimate
criminal
defendants
who
raise
the
insanity
defense
legitimately,
as
it
was
in
this
case.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
i
don't
think--
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
--i
think
the
arizona
supreme
court
addressed
that
issue.
i
think
that
they
can
testify
as
to
behavior,
but
they
cannot
provoke
a
situation,
as
they
did
here,
by
putting
the
husband
and
the
wife
together.
granted,
it
was
linda
mauro's
idea,
but
i
don't
think...
you
know,
they
can
still
testify
as
to
behavior.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
i
don't
think...
they
were
not
provoking
rationality,
per
se,
but
they
were
attempting
to
get
anything
they
could
to
use
against
this
guy
or
his
wife
in
the
prosecution,
and
they
introduced
it
and
there
were
incriminating
statements
as
far
as
committing
a
crime.
they
introduced
it
in
order
to
show
sanity.
the
thing
of
it
is...
and
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
problem
with
the
reason
they
did
it.
they
say
that...
or
at
this
point
they
attempt
to...
the
state
attempts
to
raise
an
argument
that
because
an
attorney
testified
as
to
behavior,
and
because
a
tape
was
admitted,
that
another
attorney,
defense
attorney,
took
between
the
client,
mr.
mauro
and
himself,
that
somehow
there
was
a
waiver
which
allowed--
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
--no.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
i
think
that
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
trying
to
say
is,
they
do
not
approve
of
the
behavior
of
the
police
department
and
they
are
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
introduce
this
tape
into
evidence.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
i
think
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
saying
is
that
if
you
have
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution,
if
you
have
a
fifth
amendment
violation
as
they
hold
here,
then
you
cannot
turn
around
and
introduce
it
through
the
back
door
because
the
insanity
defense
is
raised.
and
what
they
are
saying
is
that
there
is
not
going
to
be
a
situation
where
if
you
invoke
or
raise
the
insanity
defense
you
are
going
to
give
up
your
miranda
rights,
because
the
evidence
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
show
that
the
man
committed
the
crime,
assuming
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
what
they
say
is
they
are
not
going
to
back-door
it,
because
there
are
incriminating
statements
on
there
that
he
did
commit
the
crime.
and
it
was
taken
by
the
police
department
in
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
held
to
be
impermissible
conduct.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
no,
i
don't
think
you
could
say
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
miranda
rights,
and
i
think
under
that
situation,
assuming
there
was
no
husband-wife--
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
--i
think
we
are
getting
a
little
remote
in
time
for
something
like
that.
rather
than
the
police
going
in
with
her,
that--
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
--i
believe
it's
the
police
presence
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
condemning.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
the
case
should
turn
on
the
fact
that
this
was
found
to
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
custodial
interrogation,
and
it
should
also
turn
on
the
fact
that,
assuming
the
fifth
amendment
violation,
you
cannot
then
introduce
the
tape
into
evidence.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
the
fifth
amendment
violation
comes
from
the
fact
that...
and
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
pointed
it
out...
if
linda
mauro
had
not
asked
to
go
in
and
see
her
husband,
the
police
could
not
have
gone
in
and
taped
statements
made
in
that
situation.
they
could
not
interrogate
him.
but
what
they
did
was,
they
put
her
in
there
and
while
she
was
not
an
agent
of
the
police
she
was
certainly
the
motivating
factor
that
prompted
him
to
make
incriminating
statements.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
yes.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
yes.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
i
say
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
that
was
coercive
behavior,
but
if
you
take
that
tack,
there
is
no
appropriate
waiver
under
edwards.
under
edwards
you
need
some
kind
of
initiation
of
contact
from
the
defendant,
and
you
need--
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
--i
think
that
once
counsel...
the
right
to
counsel
had
been
invoked,
as
it
had
in
this
case,
then
the
police
could
not
have
gone
in
there
with
the
wife,
unbeknownst
to
the
husband.
there
was
no
initiation
and--
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
--not
until
she
walked
in.
he
had
no
say-so
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
see
his
wife.
he
is
sitting
there.
they
walk
in,
the
wife,
the
police
officer,
and
the
tape
recorder.
she
is
hysterical
and
she
is
sobbing
and
she
is
crying.
and
she's
blurting
out
things
and
he's
blurting
out
things.
and
i
think
under
an
edwards
analysis,
no,
you
would
not
have
the
appropriate...
and
what
has
not
been
done
in
this
case
is
to
completely
analyze
the
whole
situation
as
under
edwards,
not
only
as
to
initiation
but
as
to
the
voluntariness.
first
of
all,
you
know,
was
it
a
free
choice,
and
second
of
all,
did
he
understand
the
consequences
of
what
was
going
on
when
his
wife
walks
in
with
a
police
officer,
and
that
would
get
into
his
mental
state
as
well
as--
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
--no,
he
did
not.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
i
believe
that
the
testimony...
and
there
was
a
brief
statement
by
the
trial
court
judge
that
they
both
knew,
but
i
believe
that
the
testimony
was,
the
consultation
between
detective
manson
and
linda
mauro
did
not
include
any
statements
to
bill
mauro
by
either
detective
manson
or
sergeant
allen
or
captain
latham,
or
anybody
there
that
he
would
be...
that
he
knew
that
the
wife
was
coming
in.
and
while
the
trial
judge
did
make
an
offhanded
comment
about...
that
he
knew,
i
think
that
the
testimony,
if
you
go
through
the
testimony
of
the
police
officers,
there
was
no
indication
that
he
knew
that
his
wife
was
coming
in.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
my
position
is
that,
yes,
it
would
be
the
functional
equivalent
and
that
there
would
be
no
appropriate
waiver.
ms.
kathleen
kelly
walsh
that's
right.
the
police
officers
testified
that
basically
what
they
went
in
there
to
do
was
find
out
what
was
going
on,
and
i
think
it's
also
important
to
remember
that
it
was
possible
to
get
the
husband
and
the
wife
together
and
take
care
of
the
problem
of
escape
by
allowing...
and
take
care
of
the
problem
of
her
safety
by
allowing
them,
if
that's
what
their
motives
were,
to
speak
in
the
jail
facilities.
there
was
testimony
that
they
could
have...
and
then
everybody
knew
that
they
were
getting
ready
to
take
bill
mauro
over
to
the
jail
and
there
are
facilities
there
that
they
could
have
allowed
bill
and
linda
to
talk
together,
if
that's
what
they
had
so
desired
to
do.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
they
wanted
to
find
out
what
was
going
on.
they
wanted
to
find
out
linda's
involvement.
they
wanted
to
find
out
if
the
two
were
going
to
concoct
stories.
and
in
doing
that,
their
motive
in
going
in
there
and
listening
and
even
taking
a
tape
recorder
in
there
was
to
accumulate
incriminating
evidence,
to
see
what
they
could
get.
i
would
submit
that
that,
in
and
of
itself,
shows
that
the
activity
by
the
police
department
that
was
so
condemned
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
amounted
to
the
functional
equivalent
of
custodial
interrogation
under
rhode
island
versus
innis,
that
the
intent
of
the
police
officers
by
their
own
testimony
was
so
clear,
and
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
saying
was,
that
activity
is
going
to
be
condemned.
we
are
not
going
to
allow
in
the
tape
recording
which
was
made.
i
think
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
also
said
that
just
because
you
invoke
the
insanity
defense,
we
are
not
going
to
make
an
exception
for
you.
we
are
not
going
to
hold
that
your
miranda
rights,
even
though
they
may
have
been
violated,
are
going
to...
the
fruits
of
the
evidence
drawn
from
that
are
not
going
to
be
allowed
in
through
the
back
door,
if
you
will,
because
you
invoked
the
insanity
defense.
i
think
for
those
reasons
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
correct
in
finding
that
this
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
custodial
interrogation
and
that
the
tape
was
correctly
held
to
be
suppressed
by
that
court.
