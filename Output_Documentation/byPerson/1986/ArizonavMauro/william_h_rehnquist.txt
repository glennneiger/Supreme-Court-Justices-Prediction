chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
number
85-2121,
arizona
versus
william
carl
mauro.
mr.
roberts,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mrs.
walsh.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
fifth
amendment
mean
something
more
than,
the
police
know
that
incriminating
statements
might
be
made?
doesn't
the
push
for
the
incrimination
have
to
come
from
the
police?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
an
active
role,
to
allow
a
conversation
to
come
in?
the
fifth
amendment
talks
about
compulsory
self-incrimination.
miranda
talks
about
the
coercion
of
the
station
house
environment.
and
to
simply
let
a
man
talk
to
his
wife
doesn't
seem
to
fit
in
under
those
heads.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
kelly,
what
is
the
point
upon
which
you
just
said
that
the
trial
court,
the
superior
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
disagreed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
he
knew
in
advance...
he
surely
knew
when
she
in
fact
came
in,
when
the
police
officer
in
fact
came
in
and
sat
down,
that
that
was
the
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
enough
that
it
be
coercive
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it
has
to
be
coercion
produced
by
the
police
under
our
cases.
wouldn't
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
suggesting
that
if
the
police
know
that
some
incriminating
statement
is
likely,
then
it
is
interrogation
on
their
part,
but
i
think
you
are
forgetting
the
necessity
that
the
police
have
produced
the
coercion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
walsh.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
