mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
of
pleasant
grove
submits
that
it
has
borne
its
burden
in
this
case
to
show,
as
it
must
show,
that
the
two
annexations
which
it
voted
to
carry
out
do
not
have
the
purpose
of
discriminating
with
respect
to
the
right
to
vote
on
grounds
of
race.
to
show
that
we
have
done
this,
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
general
physical
surroundings
of
pleasant
grove,
and
move
on
and
discuss
then
the
annexations
that
the
city
has
attempted
to
make,
and
then
discuss
the
annexation
which
we
decided...
the
city
decided
not
to
make.
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
highway
map
of
jefferson
county
to
place
pleasant
grove
in
perspective.
pleasant
grove...
this
highway
map
is
attached
to
the
parmley
deposition.
it's
reduced.
it's
not
in
color.
but
i
think
you
can
see
the
city
just
to
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
the
original,
in
color
and
blown
up,
is.
pleasant
grove
is
the
first
city
directly
to
the
west,
about
the
center
of
birmingham,
center
south
of
birmingham.
it's
to
be
noted,
your
honor,
that
it's
almost
a
perfect
square.
if
this
city
has
been
avoiding
black
areas
and
taking
in
white
areas,
it's
been
very--
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
right
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
next
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
a
reduced
copy
of
the
postal
map
of
pleasant
grove.
this
is
exhibit
b
to...
it
first
appears
in
the
joint
appendix.
it's
referred
to
on
page
5.
it
is
a
reduced
copy
of
what's
already
in
the
record,
and
it's
not
always
legible
but
it
does
show
the
annexations.
basically,
the
annexations
in
question
in
this
case
are
on
the
far
west
of
the
city,
the
area
marked
1979.
that's
the
western
annexation.
then,
there
is
a
small
area
in
the
northwest
corner
of
the
city.
it's
just
a
quarter
section.
it's
just
40
acres.
that's
marked
1969.
that's
the
glasgow
addition.
it
actually
was
annexed
in
1971
but
the
petition
was
in
1969.
i'd
like
the
court
to
note
that
if
you
go
all
the
way
around
pleasant
grove,
there
are
no...
there
are
basically
no
roads
except
in
the
south,
the
southeast
of
the
city.
all
those
areas
except
for
the
southeast
of
the
city
are
rural
areas.
the
testimony
of
this
map
is
corroborated
by
two
geological
survey
maps
which
are
also
in
the
record.
they
are
defendant's
exhibits
28
and
29,
and
they
are
attached
to
the
parmley
deposition.
it
is
important
to
note
that
pleasant
grove,
even
after
all
its
annexations,
is
almost
completely
surrounded
by
uninhabited
territory
because,
the
fact
is,
before
the
highlands
area
was...
the
highlands
area
was
developed
in
the
late
1970s,
and
the
highlands
is
a
little...
is
one
40-acre
square
to
the
southeast
corner
of
the
city,
and
it's
called
west
smithfield
petition,
because
that's
the
old
name
of
pleasant
grove
highlands.
it's
right
here,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
it
does,
your
honor.
it's
right
here.
it's
hard
to
read,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
it's
easy
to
read
on
the
original.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
true,
your
honor.
it's
important
to
note
that
before
the
highlands
was
developed,
there
were
no
contiguous
black
areas
to
pleasant
grove,
and
there
were
no
close
black
areas
except
the
dolomite
area,
which
is
in
this
corner
of
the
map.
under
alabama
law,
to
annex
a...
for
a
city
to
annex
territory,
it
has
to
be
contiguous.
therefore,
before
the
pleasant
grove-highlands
area
was
developed,
there
was
no
conceivable
annexation
partner
for
pleasant
grove,
and
therefore
there
can
be
no
evidence
of
a
pattern
of
selective
annexation.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
before
the
development
of
pleasant
grove
highlands,
which
is
here
called
west
smithfield--
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
--which
was
in
the
late
1970s,
there
can
be
no
evidence
of
a
pattern
of
selective
annexation
because
there
were
no
blacks
to
annex.
they
weren't
contiguous
to
the
city.
if
you
wanted
to
annex
blacks,
you
would
have
to
get
the
permission
of
the
intervening
land
owners
and
reach
out
to
areas
of
black
concentration
outside
of
the
city.
there
were
no
contiguous
areas.
everything
that
was
annexed
was
contiguous.
i'd
also
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
third
exhibit,
which
is
not
part
of
the
record
but
it's
referred
to
in
my...
it's
referred
to
in
my
reply
brief.
this
is
a
decision
which
came
down
this
year
from
the
tenth
judicial
circuit
of
alabama,
and
we're
under
an
obligation
to
keep
the
court
apprised
of
developments
which
may
affect
the
case.
birmingham
annexed
all
of
the
area,
all
the
way
around
pleasant
grove,
and
it
was
set
aside
in
this
opinion
and
it's
now
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
but
what
i'd
like
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
is
the
language
on
page
4
in
the
last
complete
paragraph.
there's
a
finding
there
that
the
area
of
pleasant
grove
highlands
and
dolomite
together,
if
annexed
by
the
city
of
birmingham,
would
not
pay
the
city
of
birmingham
in
taxes
enough
to
cover
the
cost
of
services,
and
i'll
get
back
to
that
when
i
get
to
pleasant
grove
highlands.
the
other
developments
in
this
case
are
that
four
additional
black
families
either
have
moved
into
pleasant
grove
or
have
houses
under
construction,
so
we
now
have
three
black
families
in
pleasant
grove,
two
houses
under
construction.
we
have
two
black
voters
in
pleasant
grove.
i
just
determined
this
today.
four
of
these
five
houses
are
in
the
area
of
the
1967
annexation,
which
is
relevant
because
as
we
have
argued,
all
annexations
to
pleasant
grove
tend...
well,
they
don't
tend
very
much...
but
they
do
tend
to
integrate
the
city.
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
annexation
of
the
western
addition,
the
time
it
was
made,
it's
already
been
held
there
was
no
discriminatory
effect.
we
contend
that
we've
shown
that
there
can't
be
a
discriminatory
purpose,
because
if
you
look
at
what
could
have
been
in
the
minds
of
the
city
councilmen
at
the
time
that
they
voted
for
this
annexation,
there's
no
way,
there's
no
rational,
racial
purpose
that
can
arise.
first
of
all,
at
the
time
they
made
this
decision...
this
is
february
of
1979...
there's
been
no
annexation
in
eight
years.
the
last
one
was
the
glasgow
annexation.
the
last
considerable
annexation
was
in
1967.
the
'67
annexation
was
in
three
parts,
but
the
main
parcel
which
is
about
1,600
acres
is
very
much
like
the
western
addition.
it
surrounds
the
city
to
the
west
and
the
south,
and
the
western
addition
tacks
onto
that.
that
was
almost
entirely
undeveloped
land.
the
city's
conviction
is
that
it
gets
money
from
that,
and
the
record
bears
that
out.
that
annexation,
the
one
in
1967,
was
pre-cleared
by
the
justice
department.
that's
number
one.
number
two,
they're
adding
vacant
land
owned
first
by
the
city
and
second
by
developers
living
within
the
city.
third,
it's
uncontroverted
on
this
record
that
taking
in
undeveloped
land
yields
substantial
fees
for
the
city.
the
mays
affidavit,
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
joint
appendix...
we
have
to
do
some
additions
and
subtractions...
but
the
mays
affidavit
shows
that
development
fees
contributed
25
percent
of
expenditures
in
the
two
years
before
this
vote
in
1979,
about
25
percent.
fourth,
pleasant
grove
was
all
white.
it
doesn't
have
a
white
majority
that
it
needs
to
defend.
and
finally,
all
annexations,
logically,
because
they
add
new
houses,
because
we
have
fair
housing
laws,
every
time
we
add
a
new
house,
every
time
we
put
a
house
on
the
market
for
sale,
if
you're
all
white
and
you
want
to
stay
all
white
you
don't
add
new
houses.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
other
annexation
that
is
at
issue
here
today
is
the
glasgow
annexation.
this
is
more
difficult
for
us
to
justify
under
voting
rights
act
criteria
because
it
was...
glasgow's
petition
in
1969
at
a
time
when
jefferson
county
schools
were
being
desegregated
and
pleasant
grove
was
attempting
to
set
up
its
own
separate
school
system,
the
glasgows
were
in
that
school;
that
is,
they
were
in
the
pleasant
grove
school
at
the
time
the
changes
were
made,
and
they
wished
to
remain
there.
so,
they
asked
to
be
taken
into
the
city,
and
because
they
were
good
friends,
basically,
of
a
city
councilman
named
mr.
parmley,
as
judge
mckinnon
found,
they
got
in.
when
the
district
court
required
us
to
add
the
glasgow
annexation
to
our
complaint,
to
pre-clear
the
western
annexation,
we
told
the
court
that
rather
than
do
that
we
would
prefer
to
abandon
it,
and
the
court
told
us
that
they
wouldn't
allow
us
to
do
that.
that's
not
relevant
except
if
the
argument
is
made
that
we're
trying
to
add
white
voters,
we
certainly
tried
to
get
rid
of
these
white
voters,
as
soon
as
any
difficulties
were
presented,
in
favor
of
an
area
with
no
white
voters,
to
with,
the
western
addition
which
has
no
people
in
it
at
all,
at
least
for
the
moment.
but
if
we
look
at
what
goes
through
the
mind
of
a
city
councilman,
and
if
the
issue
is,
are
they
discriminating
with
respect
to
voting,
at
the
time
they
make
that
decision,
we
submit,
they
are
not
discriminating
with
respect
to
voting.
there
are
no
black
areas
petitioning
at
that
time,
for
the
reason
that
we
stated
before,
there
were
no
black
areas
continguous
to
pleasant
grove
until
the
late
1970s,
and
this
is
1969.
they
got
in
because
they
were
in
the
school.
they
were
friends
of
people
in
pleasant
grove,
and
they
let
them
in
so
they
could
stay
in
the
school.
this
brings
us
to
the
area
which
the
government
claims
we
should
have
let
in
and
we
did
not
let
in,
on
racially
discriminatory
grounds,
and
that
is
the
area
of
pleasant
grove
highlands
which
is
that
40-acre
section
to
the
southeast
of
the
city
which
is
marked,
"west
smithfield
petition".
when
this
petition
came
to
the
attention
of
the
city
council,
they
appointed
a
committee
to
study
it
and
the
committee
basically
concluded,
based
not
on
any
new
study
it
made
but
on
its
practice
in
the
last...
since
1967,
to
take
in
undeveloped
land
to
get
the
development
fees,
that
it
was
not
economical
to
take
it
in.
what
they
did
give
them
was
free
fire
and
paramedic
protection.
they
did
that
because
what
precipitated--
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
--yes,
but
that
is--
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
--no,
they
gave
it
to
them.
they
had
given
it
to
them.
they
had
given
their
neighbors,
basically,
free
fire
and
paramedic
protection.
they
had
given
it
to
the
glasgow
addition
before
they
annexed
them.
they
gave
it
to
these
people
on
their
southeast
border.
they
gave
it
also
to
some
of
the
people
in
dolomite.
when
in
1979,
after
the
decision
to
take
in
the
western
addition,
they
decided
that
there
were
too
many
strings
on
their
fire
and
police...
basically
their
fire
and
paramedic...
and
they
announced
that
they
were
going
to
withdraw
it,
and
immediately
they
got...
not
immediately,
but
first
from
pleasant
grove
highlands
and
later
from
dolomite
that
same
year,
they
were
asked
to
be
annexed.
it's
uncontested,
in
any
event,
the
government
did
not
contest
below,
our
figures
showing
that
if
pleasant
grove
highlands
were
annexed
to
the
city
it
would
only
pay
in
taxes
about
14
percent
of
the
cost
of
services
in
1980.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
it's
a
estimate
of
the
cost
of
services
to
them,
and
the
estimate
is
based
on
an
assumption
that
they
will
cost
exactly
the
same
as
everyone
else
does
per
capita.
the
way
the
figure
was
created,
your
honor,
is
they
took
the
total
cost
of
services
for
pleasant
grove.
they
divided
it
per
household,
or
per
capita,
i'm
not
sure
which,
either
per
capita
or
per
household,
and
they
figured
out
how
much
it
cost
per
household.
and
then
they
figured
out
how
many
households
there
were
in
pleasant
grove
highlands
and
assumed
that
they'd
pay
the
same
per
capita
taxes
as
everyone...
no,
they
didn't
assume
that.
sarah
mays,
as
the
city
treasurer,
went
through
what
you
get
in
taxes,
and
made
an
estimate
which
was
conceded
by
the
government
as
to
what
would
go
up
in
rough
proportion
to
population
if
pleasant
grove
highlands
was
annexed.
and
the
figure
that
came
out
was
14
percent,
and
the
government
conceded
the
accuracy
of
the
figure.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
yes.
you
have
to
find
that
that's
clearly...
you
have
to
find
that
the
district
court's
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
if
you
find
that
with
respect
to
the
decision
on
the
western
addition
or
the
glasgow
annexation
there
was
a
discriminatory
purpose,
then
we
fail.
then
we
lose.
if
you
find
there
was
no
discriminatory
purpose
on
the
glasgow
addition
or
the
western
annexation
but
there
was
in
the
pleasant
grove
highlands
decision,
then
our
argument
is
that
we
win.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
because
those
two
annexations
are
the
two
annexations
which
are
the
subject
of
the
voting
rights
act,
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
voting
rights
act
only
covers
changes.
it
doesn't
cover
non-changes.
the
decisions
to
take
in
the
glasgow
annexation
and
the
western
addition
were
changes,
and
thus
covered
by
the
act.
the
decision
not
to
take
in
pleasant
grove
highlands
was
not
a
change
and
thus
not
covered
by
the
act.
and
thus,
if
you
decide
that
there
was
discrimination
in
not
taking
in
the
pleasant
grove
highlands,
the
government
can
sue
and
undertake
the
burden
of
proof
and,
as
in
gomillion
v.
lightfoot--
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
--that's
not
a
voting
rights
act
case.
and
the
important
fact,
of
course,
is
who's
got
the
burden
of
proof.
putting
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
city
is
very
onerous,
and
we
submit
congress
only
intended
to
change
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
cases
which
it
set
out
in
the
statute,
and
that's
just
changes.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
well,
perhaps
i
shouldn't--
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
--well,
that's
the
question,
justice
white.
we
have
to
show
under
section
5--
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
--on
the
whole,
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
his
argument,
as
i
remember
it
is,
how
can
there
be
a
discriminatory
purpose
if
there
is
no
discriminatory
effect.
you're
just
creating
a
legal
fiction
if
you
pretend
there's
a
discriminatory
purpose
where
there's
no
effect.
now,
there
are
some
factual
situations,
as
in
the
busby
case,
which
is
cited.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
well,
you
can
make
an
argument...
we
haven't
made
this
argument
because
we
didn't
think
we
had
to
make
it,
but
you
can
make
the
argument
that
adding
vacant
land
is
not
a
voting
rights...
is
not
a
change
of
voting
rights
practice,
because
there's
nobody
there.
that
argument--
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
--taking
in
the
glasgow
is
a
change,
because
there
are
voters
in
the
glasgow
addition.
now,
it
has
no
discriminatory
effect,
obviously,
because
there
are
no
black
voters
in
pleasant
grove
to
have
their
vote
diluted.
well,
finally,
it's
also
not
contested
that
$45,000
in
development
fees
are
given
up
if
you
take
in
the
79
houses
in
pleasant
grove
highlands
rather
than
building
them
out
in
the
western
addition
and
getting
your
development
fees
up
front.
also,
there's
a
racially
discriminatory
effect
if
you
take
in
the
pleasant
grove
highlands,
because
they
vote
as
an
insignificant
minority
in
pleasant
grove
instead
of
as
a
considerable
minority
in
jefferson
county.
the
government
correctly
puts
out
that
they
still
get
to
vote
in
jefferson
county,
but
the
essential
services
of
local
governments
will
be
protected
by...
will
be
provided
by
pleasant
grove
and
not
jefferson
county.
finally,
your
honor,
we
concede
that
you
can
look
at
the
pleasant
grove
highlands
decision
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
discriminatory
purpose
as
to
the
decision
made
two
months
earlier
on
the
western
addition,
or
the
decision
made
eight
years
earlier
on
the
glasgow
addition.
it's
technically
relevant
but
it's
not
very
probative,
because
first
of
all,
they
don't
know
it's
coming.
the
reason
that
pleasant
grove
highlands
petitioned
was
that
they
got
their
paramedic
and
fire
cut
off
a
month
later,
and
we
also
say
it's
not
very
probative
because
pleasant
grove
highlands
is
so
unpersuasive
from
an
economic
point
of
view
as
a
rational
annexation
partner.
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
justice
scalia,
what
mr.
ganzfried
said
about
sales
in
the
1967
addition...
i
mean,
annexation,
that
every
single
house
was
sold
to
white
people
is
inaccurate.
as
i
represented
this
morning,
four
have
now
been
sold
to
black
people.
secondly,
the
city
is
not
ringed
by
unincorporated
black
communities
as
mr.
ganzfried
said.
as
we
pointed
out...
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
beginning
of
my
argument,
supported
by
the
postal
map
of
pleasant
grove,
unincorporated
black
communities...
the
postal
map
of
pleasant
grove
and
geological
survey,
except
for
the
southeast
of
the
city,
it
is
surrounded
by
empty
land.
third,
it
doesn't
really
mean
much
to
say
that
the
1979
decision
to
take
in
the
western
addition
is
contemporaneous
with
the
decision
not
to
take
in
pleasant
grove
highlands.
it's
true,
there's
some
overlap
but
the
timing
is
as
follows:
in
late
1978
the
people
who
owned...
the
people
who
lived
in
pleasant
grove,
who
owned
the
western
addition,
came
to
the
city
and
started
talking
to
the
mayor.
the
mayor
presented
the
question
to
the
city
council
on
february
5th.
it
was
immediately
sent
to
the
state
legislature
of
alabama,
which
was
willing
to
consider
it
only
because
it
was
completely
unpopulated.
the
state
legislature
of
alabama
will
not
vote
to
take
one
community
into
another
community
if
there
are
people
in
there
unless
they
get
a
chance
to
vote
on
it.
so
that,
the
two
if...
they
decided
to
take
in
the
highlands,
they
couldn't
combine
these
two
decisions.
then
in
march
of
1979
they
took
away
the
fire
and
paramedic
protection.
in
april
the
highlands
asked
to
be
annexed.
then
it
was
sent
to
a
committee.
some
months
later,
at
the
end
of
1979,
they
said,
we'll
give
you
your
fire
and
paramedic
protection
back.
then
there
was
some
shilly-shallying.
eventually
they
didn't
do
anything.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
it's
not
a
holding.
they
suggested
that.
they
said
they
would
find--
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
--i
think...
i
mean,
i
have
to
really
look
at
the
language,
but
my
memory
is
that
the
district
court
said,
not
only
do
we
find
they
haven't
carried
out
their
burden
of
proof,
but
if
the
burden
of
proof
was
the
other
way
would
we
rule
the
same
way.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
yes.
well,
it
wasn't
a
holding,
your
honor.
judge
mckinnon
went
the
other
way.
with
respect
to
the
city
of
richmond
case
and
the
city
of
rome
cases,
of
course
we
depend
heavily
on
the
city
of
richmond
case
because
it's
our
contention
that
if
pleasant
grove
tried
to
bring
in
the
highlands,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act
because
the
effect...
it
would
be
an
effect
of
diluting
their
vote,
diluting
their
vote
for
essential
city
services.
so,
we
rely
very
heavily
on
the
richmond
case,
against
the
government.
what
makes
richmond
and
rome
different
from
this
case,
in
both
of
those
cases
you
had
large
cities
with
large
black
minorities.
in
the
richmond
case,
richmond
actually
had
a
black
majority
before
the
annexation.
so,
there's
a
reason
to
attribute
to
the
white
people
some
sensitivity
to
bringing
in
a
few
more
white
people,
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
there
were
no
black
people,
no
black
voters
in
pleasant
grove
at
the
time
these
decisions
were
made.
in
the
city
of
rome
case
we
have
a
lot
of
annexations
of
vacant
land,
but
there,
if
my
memory's
correct,
there
were
60
annexations
in
four
years.
so,
it's
plausible
the
conflate
to
put
together
all
the
annexations
and
say,
well,
there's
one
common
purpose.
but
here
you're
talking
about
four
annexations
in
50
years.
as
to
the
point
about...
justice
scalia's
point
and
justice
o'connor's
point,
i
think
that
the
government's
position
in
this
case
does
ask
us
to
make
decisions
based
on
speculation
as
to
future
impacts
on
voting,
and
you
can
argue
that
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
cases
in
which
there's
going
to
be
no
impact
on
voting
for
five
or
six
years
except
to
say,
for
the
immediate
future
there's
no
effect.
mr.
thomas
g.
corcoran,
jr.
because
of
the
city
of
richmond
case.
the
city
of
richmond
case,
perkins
v.
mathews,
city
of
richmond
case,
suggested
that
annexations
were
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act.
i
certainly
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
if
the
justice
department
came
out
with
regulations
and
said,
in
cases
like
this
case
you're
not
to
petition
until
you
have
an
immediate
effect,
that
the
court
would
defer
to
those
regulations
and
there
would
be
no
problem
in
upholding
them.
but
of
course,
they
don't
have
those
regulations,
and
there
was
a
holding
from
this
court,
and
the
practice
of
the
attorney
general,
of
course,
was
to
look
at
these
things
immediately.
finally...
and
i
end
on
a
weak
note
here,
but
finally,
as
to
the
so-called
mushroom
problem,
i'd
like
the
court
to
entertain
our
argument
that
the
mushroom
problem
refers
not
to
pleasant
grove
highlands
but
to
dolomite.
dolomite
is
a
very
poor
area.
the
city
did
not
want
to
be
in
a
position
where
it
had
to
offer
services
to
dolomite.
as
i've
said
before,
the
city
has
a
custom
of
offering
free
services
to
small
communities
around
its
borders,
when
it
doesn't
have
any
problem
covering
its
own
area.
dolomite
is
a
very
large
community
and
the
city
did
want
to
have
to
take
in
dolomite.
and
at
the
time
they
made
these
decisions
about
the
mushroom
problem,
the
mushroom
problem
was
not
directed
towards
pleasant
grove
highlands
because
these
communities
that
they
were
thinking...
that
they
didn't
take
in
didn't
abut
on...
either
didn't
abut
on
the
highlands,
or
two,
the
highlands
didn't
exist
at
the
time
the
decisions
were
made.
thank
you
very
much.
