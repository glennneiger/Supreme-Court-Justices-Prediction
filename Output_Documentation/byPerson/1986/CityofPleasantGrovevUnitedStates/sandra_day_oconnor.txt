but,
mr.
ganzfried,
doesn't...
to
trigger
the
application
of
the
statute
at
all,
doesn't
it
have
to
have
some
effect
on
voting
qualifications
or
practices
or
procedures,
and
how
does
taking
in
vacant
land
have
such
an
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
the
statute
alone--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
sort
of
thing
happen
a
lot?
are
we
seeing
a
lot
of
this
annexations
of
vacant
land?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--why
doesn't
the
attorney
general
take
the
position
that
unless
there
is
some
change
in
voting,
that
an
application
to
him
for
review
and
approval
under
this
voting
rights
act
section
is
just
not
timely?
and
then
you
save
your
right
to
examine
it
when
in
fact
there's
some
voting
change--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
statute...
i
mean,
as
i
look
at
the
statute
anyway,
it
doesn't
even
come
into
effect
unless
there's
some
change
in
voting
qualification
prerequisite
to
voting,
or
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
that's
different.
and
if
there
isn't
one,
how
does
the
statute
ever
figure
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
why
don't
you
say,
you
can't
file
one?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
did
the
city
ask
for
pre-clearance?
