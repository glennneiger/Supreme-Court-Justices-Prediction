--do
they
sell
them?
do
they
sell
them
or
do
they
give
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i'm
still
not
quite
sure
why
you
think
that
you
lose
the
case
if
there
is
a
discriminatory
purpose
in
taking
in
the
western
and
glasgow.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
couldn't
have
any
impact
on
the
voting
rights,
could
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
you...
are
you
agreeing
with
judge
mckinnon
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
he
thought
about
discriminatory
purpose,
about
the
western--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
why
do
you
say
there
was
coverage
on
those
two
annexations?
you
say
they
were
changes?
were
they?
changes
in
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
taking
in
the
glasgow
a
change?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
here
would
say
that
if
there's
a
discriminatory
purpose
that
violates
the
act,
even
though
there
couldn't
possibly
be
any
discriminatory
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
closest
case
in
this
court?
is
that
the
only
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
have
already
answered
this.
did
the
attorney
general
turn
these
down,
turn
these
annexations
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
his...
did
he
write
an
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
look
to
see
if
it
diminishes
the
relative
status
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
know,
but
proportional
representation,
fair
representation
is
not
the
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
find
there
was
a
discriminatory
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
didn't
find
that
the
city
had
failed
to
carry
its
burden
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
argument...
all
of
this
is
revolving
around
the
validity
of
the
conclusion
below,
that
you
hadn't
carried
your
burden
of
showing
no
discriminatory
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
it's
about,
isn't
it?
do
you
agree
with
your
opposition
that
the
district
court
actually
found
a
discriminatory
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
have
found--
justice
byron
r.
white
--we
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
and
reading
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
reapportionment
case
and
it
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
affirmed.
justice
powell
has
