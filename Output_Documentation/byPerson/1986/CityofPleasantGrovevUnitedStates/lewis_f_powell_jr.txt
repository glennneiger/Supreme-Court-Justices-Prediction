justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--may
i
come
back
to
your
reliance
on
the
city
of
richmond
case.
actually,
in
that
case
the
annexation
at
issue
involved
thousands
of
people
in
chesterfield
county
who
were
proposed
to
be
annexed,
and--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--do
you
think
that
case
is
analogous
to
this
one?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
analogous
to
our
decision
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
effect
would
have
been
substantially
to
dilute
the
black
vote
in
the
city
of
richmond.
the
statistics
prove
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
was
opposed
by
the
black
community
only
because
their
vote
would
be
diluted.
well,
let's
move
on.
let's
move
on.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what's
your
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
pursue
some
of
these
other
questions
a
little
bit?
assume
you
had
two
communities,
one
all
white
and
one
all
black,
and
the
law
in
alabama
or
whatever
state
the
state
may
be
permitted
the
white
community
to
annex.
let's
assume
it
decided
not
to
annex
any
of
the
black
area.
would
that
be
unlawful?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
why
is
this
case
different,
because--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--you
are
saying
the
city
cannot
make
a
choice?
it
doesn't
have
to
annex
anyone,
does
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
there
had
been
no
requests
for
annexation
by
black
citizens.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
there
were
an
area
occupied
by
black
citizens
and
an
area
occupied
by
white
citizens,
and
the
latter
was
annexed
and
the
former
was
not
annexed,
if
there
were
no
requests
from
the
black
citizens
to
be
annexed--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
the
fact
that
there
was
an
area
here,
a
black
area
that
wanted
to
be
annexed
at
an
earlier
date
makes
no
difference
to
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
though
there
is
no
change
whatever
in
voting
rights
of
the
black
citizens,
or
indeed
the
white
citizens?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--there
will
ever
be
a
change--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--it
may
not
have
any
effect
on
voting
for
ten,
fifteen,
twenty
years.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
we
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
potential
conduct
that
may
or
may
never
occur?
