mr.
ganzfried,
i'm
a
little
worried
about
having
a
continuous
unit
with
white
and
black
people,
and
then
you
bring
in
1,000
white
people
and
say
it
doesn't
dilute
anybody's
vote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
does,
in
the
present--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--it
doesn't
dilute--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--but
their
vote--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
will
that
dilute
the
negro
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay.
you've
got
this
1,000
white
votes
in
jefferson
county,
and
you've
got
4,000
negro
votes
in
jefferson
county,
and
you
annex
2,000
white
votes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they'll
be
in
jefferson
county.
justice
thurgood
marshall
jefferson
county
will
have
2,000
more
white
votes
and
no
more
negro
votes.
and
that
doesn't
dilute
it?
