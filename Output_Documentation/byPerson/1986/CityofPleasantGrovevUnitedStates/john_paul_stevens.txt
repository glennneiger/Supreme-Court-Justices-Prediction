i'll
just
follow
that
up
with...
i
guess
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
they
had
developed
the
land
before
they
sought
to
annex
it,
and
they
have
added
1,000
white
people
in
the
new
development,
would
that
be
an
unlawful
effect
or
wouldn't
it?
i
think
what
justice
scalia
is
suggesting
is,
under
your
rationale
here,
you'd
have
to
say
that
effect
would
be
unlawful.

without
proving
any
wrongful
purpose
in
connection
with
that
acquisition?
