what
was
annexed?
you're
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
services
to
them,
or
services
everywhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ganzfried,
if
i
understood
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
earlier,
you
concede
that
the
city
does
not
bear
any
burden
of
showing
no
discriminatory
motive
in
not
annexing
the
pleasant
grove
highlands?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
that's
relevant
in
view--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is
relevant
only
because
it
is
relevant
to
what
their
motive
was
in
making
the
other,
earlier
annexations?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
order
of
the
decision
on
the
two,
and
how
much
were
they
separated
in
time?
when
did
pleasant
grove
seek
the
annexation
of
the
western--
justice
antonin
scalia
--february,
april?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
theory
you're
asking
us
to
accept
is
that
we
should
consider
it
a
dilution
of
voting
rights
if
it
has
a
potential
to
cause
a
dilution
in
the
future,
when
a
black
person
would
have
moved
into
pleasant
grove,
right?
because
at
the
time
there
was
no
dilution
of
any
minority
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume,
mr.
ganzfried,
that
the
effect
which
you
must
purpose
is
the
same
as
the
effect
that
is
referred
to
in
the
other
part
of
the
injunctive
provision
in
the
statute,
okay.
so
that
means
that
if
we
hold
in
this
case
that
there
is
an
invalid
purpose,
then
would
it
not
follow
that
it
is
always
an
impermissible
effect
for
the
municipality
that's
covered
by
the
act
to
annex
any
portion
in
which
white
voters
will
outnumber
black
voters?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
purpose
is
to
bring
in
more
white
voters
than
black
voters?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
here
you're
saying,
is
to
add
white
voters
in
excess
of
black
voters,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
but
my
point
is,
if
that
is
a
bad
purpose
in
and
of
itself,
then
that
would
always
be
a
bad
effect
in
and
of
itself
as
well,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
my
concern
is
that
what
we
do
on
the
purpose
prong
may
affect
what
we
do
on
the
effect
prong
later
on.
and
if
a
prospective
influx
of
additional
white
voters
is
enough
to
establish
a
bad
purpose,
i
would
think
that
a
prospective
influx
of
white
voters
is
enough
to
establish
a
bad
effect
as
well.
so
that,
every
time
there
is
an
annexation,
one
will
have
to
figure
out
what
the
likely
demographic
population
in
the
future
is
going
to
be,
and
if
it's
likely
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
all
very
helpful.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
all
very
helpful
when
you're
deciding
a
purpose
case.
but
i...
which
is
what
this
is,
but
i'm
wondering
whether
your
description
of
what
it
is
that
must
be
purposed
will
not
affect
us
in...
should
we
use
that
word...
will
not
alter
the
kind
of
decision
we
have
to
make
in
effect
cases
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you
are
saying
that
it's
not
a
bad
effect
because
there's
no
bad
purpose,
and
there
goes
the
end
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ganzfried,
why
is
that
even
a
plausible
purpose
to
attribute
to
the
city?
you
have
a
city
that
has
not
a
single
black
voter
at
the
time
the
annexation
is
made.
there
are
fair
housing
laws.
so,
it's
clear
that
every
time
you
sell
a
house
you're
taking
a
chance
if
you
want
to
preserve
that
kind
of
an
electorate.
you're
taking
a
chance
that
a
black
will
buy
that
house.
why
is
it
even
plausible
that
if
the
city
wanted
to
keep
an
entire
white
electorate,
it
wouldn't
annex
anything--
justice
antonin
scalia
--always
a
chance,
though.
every
time
a
house
is
sold
there's
a
chance.
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
annexation?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
annexation,
not
in
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
not
in
the
aggregate
of
the
two
annexations
plus
the
refusal
to
annex?
i
mean--
