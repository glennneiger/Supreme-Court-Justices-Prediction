mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
city
of
pleasant
grove
has
sustained
its
burden
of
proving
that
its
decisions
to
make
two
annexations,
the
western
addition
in
1979
and
the
glasgow
property
in
1971,
its
burden
of
proving
that
those
two
decisions
were
made
without
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
at
the
time
of
the
annexation,
the
glasgow
annexation,
there
were
people
living
there.
they
petitioned
for
that
annexation
four
days
after
the
federal
district
court
had
entered
its
desegregation
order
for
the
pleasant
grove
schools,
and
four
days
after
pleasant
grove
announced
that
it
was
going
to
secede
from
the
county
school
system
to
set
up
its
own.
in
the
western
addition
there
were
no
people
living
there
at
the
time
of
the
annexation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
our
contention
is
not
that
it
did
dilute
anyone's
voting
rights.
our
position
is
that
the
annexation,
which
expanded
the
borders,
political
borders
of
the
city,
expanded
the
franchise,
was
a
step
that
was
taken
with
a
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
has
no
present
effect.
it
has
a
potential
effect.
it
has
a
present
effect
in
expanding
the
borders,
and
when
people
live
there,
as
it
was
anticipated,
with
the
express
purpose
of
the
annexation,
it
will
expand
the
franchise
and
the
size
of
the
electorate.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
doesn't
dilute
the
vote
of
anyone
who
is
presently
voting
in
the
city.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
certainly
has
a
potential
for
diluting
the
vote.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--any
black
citizen
that
ever
moves
into
pleasant
grove,
whether
by
way
of
moving
or
by
way
of
being
annexed
into
the
city.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
affects
their
vote.
it
would
affect
their
vote.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
will
dilute
the
vote
when
the
day
comes
that
there
are
black
voters
in
pleasant
grove.
as
mr.
corcoran
tells
us
this
morning,
there
are
now--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
will
still
be
in
jefferson
county.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
jefferson
county...
the
borders
of
jefferson
county--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
dilutes
the
vote
in
jefferson
county,
but
jefferson
county
in
this
case
has
only
grown
internally.
it
hasn't
expanded
its
boundaries.
so
that,
had
there
been
an
expansion
of
jefferson
county,
and
that
was
the
jurisdiction
that
was
before
us,
absolutely
there
would
be
a
present
dilution
of
black
votes,
no
question
about
that.
this
is
the
city
that
comes
in
and
says,
because
it
has
been
absolutely
successful
in
excluding
black
people
from
every
aspect
of
life
in
pleasant
grove,
and
as
a
result
there
are
no
black
citizens
of
pleasant
grove
and
no
black
voters
in
pleasant
grove,
they
now
seek
to
be
rewarded
for
the
total
success
of
the
past
discrimination.
and
they
say
that
that
has
created
an
exemption
for
them
from
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
because,
after
all,
since
we
don't
have
any
black
voters
in
the
city,
how
could
anything
we
do
possibly
affect
the
voting
rights
of
black
people
in
the
city
of
plesant
grove.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
pleasant
grove
highlands,
because
if
was
a
decision
not
to
make
an
annexation,
did
not
constitute
a
change
that
triggered
the
section
5
pre-clearance.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
is
relevant--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
the
western
addition
is
not
an
earlier
annexation.
it's
a
contemporaneous
decision,
contemporaneous
with
the
decision
with
respect
to
the
highlands,
your
honor,
because
the
state
statute
that
permitted
the
annexation
was
not
signed
by
the
governor
until
many
months
after
the
pleasant
grove
highlands
petition
had--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--that
was
voted
by
the
council
on
february
5th
of
1979.
the
date
of
the
petition
from
the
highlands
was
in
april
of
'79.
the
act
was
signed
by
the
governor,
authorizing
the
western
addition
in
july
of
1979.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
february,
april
and
july,
at
the
time
that
the
western...
that
the
highlands
petition
was
presented,
the
western
addition
matter
was
still
pending
in
terms
of
being
advertised
in
the
local
newspapers
and
was
before
the
state
legislature.
so,
there
were
certainly
contemporaneous
decisions
made
by
the
same
decision
makers.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
at
the
time
there
was
no
dilution
of
anyone
who
was
living
in
the
city,
at
the
time
of
the
annexation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
question
of
dilution
is
really
a
question
that
arises
under
the
effects
prong
of
section
5.
section
5
has
two
prongs.
the
city
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
its
actions
were
not
taken
with
a
discriminatory
purpose,
nor
with
a
discriminatory
effect.
the
question
of
actual,
immediate,
present
dilution
goes
to
the
effects
aspect
of
it,
and
that
is
not
part
of
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
let
me
refer
to
the
city
of
richmond
case
in
which,
after
a
long
analysis
in
which
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
unlawful
effect.
it
then
said,
so
much
for
the
effect
prong
of
section
5.
we
are
now
turning
to
the
purpose
prong
of
section
5
because
the
presence
of
a
discriminatory
purpose
will
invalidate
a
decision
even
if
there
is
no
unlawful
effect.
and,
the
richmond
case
was
remanded
on
the
question
of
purpose,
even
though
this
court
had
decided
that
there
was
no
unlawful
effect.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
believe...
it's
not
the
only
one.
the
court
has
said
many
times
that
because
the
statute
is
written
in
the
conjunctive,
that
the
jurisdiction,
seeking
approval
of
its
change,
has
the
burden
of
proving
both
the
absence
of
a
discriminatory
purpose
and
the
absence
of
a
discriminatory
effect.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
has
that
effect.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
way
i'd
like
to
answer
that.
the
first
is,
it
has
an
effect,
particularly
when
it
is
an
annexation
of
vacant
land
intended
for
development,
we
agree
that
the
annexation
of
vacant
land
for
building
an
airport,
or
to
construct
a
public
park,
does
not
constitute
a
voting
change
and
therefore,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
the
attorney
general
does
not
require
pre-clearance
of
those
sorts
of
annexations.
but
when
it
is
an
annexation
that
is
intended
for
the
purpose
of
development,
to
expand
a
franchise
by
adding
residential
areas
to
the
city,
then
section
5
is
triggered
and
there
must
be
clearance
before
anyone
is
permitted
to
vote
in
those
areas.
now,
as
it
happened,
the
city
of
pleasant
grove
chose
to
submit
that
annexation
for
pre-clearance
immediately
following
the
passage
of
the
legislation,
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
population
in
the
western
addition.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
point
i
was
making--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it's
analogous
with
respect
to
the
point
that
justice
white's
question
goes
to.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
certainly
is,
because
it's
a
case
that
turned
exclusively
on
the
purpose,
even
though
there
was
no
unlawful
effect.
the
city
of
rome
case
was
one
where
there
were
uninhabited
territories
that
were
annexed.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
but
the
court
concluded
that
because
the
plan
that
would
be
in
effect
subsequent
to
the
annexation
provided
fair
representation
that
there
was
no
unlawful
effect.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
but
it
affects
the
point
i
was
responding
to
justice
white
on,
namely
that
there
was...
it
was
a
case
that
turned
only
on
purpose
where
there
was
no
unlawful
effect.
the
city
of
rome
case
is
one
where
there
was
uninhabited
land
that
was
annexed,
and
the
court
found
that--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--city
of
rome,
city
of
richmond?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
indeed,
i
would
refer
also
to
perkins
versus
matthews
in
which
one
of
the
three
annexations
that
were
at
issue
there,
it
was
pointed
out,
involved
an
increase
in
the
population
but
that
added
no
white
voters.
let
me
get
back
to
the
procedural
point,
justice
o'connor.
the
city
came
in
immediately
after
the
annexation.
under
section
5
the
attorney
general
has
only
60
days
in
which
to
make
a
decision
on
an
annexation.
if
he
fails
to
object,
that
annexation
is
pre-cleared
and
that
means
that
when
the
day
comes
that
the
western
addition
is
populated,
as
the
city
intended
and
anticipated,
by
the
increase
of
substantial
numbers
of
white
population,
that
there
would
be
no
further
opportunity
for
section
5
pre-clearance.
that
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
section
5
by
allowing
jurisdictions
to
manipulate
by
the
timing
of
their
submissions,
around
the
burden
of
proof,
by
saying
because
there's
no
present
effect,
therefore
there
can
be
no
discriminatory
purpose.
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
purpose
prong
has
been
written
right
out
of
the
statute.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
annexation
of
vacant
land
is
a
very
common
form
of
expansion,
and
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
the
report
of
the
united
states
civil
rights
commission
to
congress,
pointing
out
that
most
of
the
annexations
that
have
been
objected
to
by
the
department
were
to
annexations
of
land
populated
largely
by
white
people,
or
to
annexations
of
land
that
was
vacant.
it
has
certainly
been
made
known
to
congress
that
that
is
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
and
congress
has
re-enacted
section
5
without
change.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
turned
the
western
annexation
down.
the
glasgow
annexation
was
never
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
is
a
letter
to
the
city
that
is
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
is
attached
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
that's
document
no.
24
in
the
record,
and
the
letter
from
the
department
of
justice
is
exhibit
f,
for
that
submission.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
letter's
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
because
the
effect
that...
let
me
restate
our
position
in
the
case.
i
think
it
might
clarify
things
a
bit.
our
position
is
that
when
a
covered
jurisdiction
makes
a
change
that
calls
for
section
5
pre-clearance,
and
certainly
this
does,
and
the
city
sought
that
pre-clearance,
and
it
makes
that
change
with
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
or
fails
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proving
that
it
did
not
have
that
purpose--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--which
purpose
is
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
this
case
the
intent
is
to
expand
the
size
of
the
monolithic
white
electorate.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no,
because
under
the
court
cases
that
you
would
look
to
is
whether
as
a
consequence
of
that
change
the
voting
system
in
that
jurisdiction
would
provide
fair
representation
to
minorities
on
the
basis
of
their
share
of
the
population,
and--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
you
look
to
see
if
it
diminishes.
but
for
example,
once
again
in
the
city
of
richmond
case,
the
changes
there
did
diminish
the
percentage
of
the
black
population
in
the
city
of
richmond.
the
court
found
that
it
did
not
have
an
unlawful
effect
under
section
5.
by
the
same
token
there
are
instances--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
let
me
focus
on
the
purpose
prong,
because
that
is
really
the
submission
that
we're
making
here.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
think
it
oversimplifies
this
case
somewhat
to
say
that
we
have
simply
a
potential
influx
of
white
voters.
we
also
have
a
fencing
out
of
black
voters,
as
indicated
not
only
by
the
decision
not
to
annex
the
highlands
area,
but
as
also
indicated
by
the
city's
decision
as
early
as
1969
not
to
annex
white
areas
or
largely
unpopulated
areas
because
of
what
the
mayor
described
as
the
"mushroom"
or
"snowball"
effect
that
might
increase
the
pressure
upon
the
city
later
to
annex
black
areas
that
were
at
that
point
a
little
more
on
the
outskirts
of
town.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
have
a
fencing
out
of
black
voters.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
don't
see
that
it
would.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
this
jurisdiction,
the
answer
to
that
is
probably
yes.
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that
because--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--okay.
if
there
is
no
unlawful
purpose
and
it
is
simply
that
as
a
matter
of
happenstance,
and
we
are
assuming
out
any
unlawful
purpose
in
that
instance,
then
it
may
well
be
that
that
would
not
be
an
unlawful
effect.
simply
the
fact
that
demographics
move
in
a
particular
direction
isn't
something
that
we
have
any
control
over
under
section
5.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i
just
followed
along
on
a
hypothetical.
if
the
hypothetical
is
that
a
city
can
be
in
this
position,
namely,
to
be
an
all-white
city
ringed
by
concentrations
of
unincorporated
black
communities
which
pleasant
grove
is,
and
for
it
to
happen
just
as...
without
any
motive
or
purpose
behind
it
that
only
white
people
continue
to
move
into
the
city,
and
there's
no
racial
discrimination
involved
in
that
hypothetical,
which
seems
rather
remote,
then
maybe
in
that
instance
there's
no
unlawful
effect.
but
it
may
also
be--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--also
in
that
instance
you're
likely
to
find
that
there
is
an
unlawful
purpose.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
because
of
the
way
the
statute
is
written.
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
object
within
60
days,
it's
pre-cleared.
there's
no
second
opportunity.
there's
no
chance
to
say,
well,
wait
a
minute
now.
now
there
are
people
living
there.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
because
the
city
made
a
submission
under
section
5.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
because
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
legal
consequence
of
saying,
you're
too
early,
and
not
objecting
to
it
within
60
days,
is
that
it
will
be
pre-cleared,
because
the
statute
says
that
if
the
attorney
general
has
not
interposed
an
objection
within
60
days
after
such
submission,
then
the
city
is
permitted
to
pursue
the
change.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
would
not
trigger
section
5
review.
it
may
well
be
unlawful
under
other
sections
or
the
voting
rights
act,
but
it
would
not
trigger
section
5
because
there
would
be
no
change.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
because
here
the
city
has
voted
to
make
an
annexation.
it
has
decided
to
enlarge
its
boundaries,
and
it
has
done
it
for
the
purpose
of
enlarging
the
franchise.
it
intended
the
development.
that
has
been
part
of
the
city's
submission
all
along.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
doesn't.
if
it
makes
no
annexation,
there
is
no
section
5
review
triggered
because
then,
there
is
not
a
change.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
wouldn't
change
the
equation
of
whether
section
5
is
triggered.
it
might
change
the
evidentiary
facts
to
be
considered.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
there
is
an
annexation,
and
as
i
understand
that
hypothetical
there
would
be,
but
we
have
the
white
area.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
then
section
5
would
be
triggered.
the
question
before
the
court
would
be,
is
that
jurisdiction
permitted
to
annex
that
white
area.
the
question
is
not,
and
it's
not
in
this
case,
whether
it
must
annex
the
black
area.
but
its
actions
in
rejecting
one
and
accepting
another
are
indicative
of
the
purpose.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
makes
a
very
important
evidentiary
difference
as
to
the
city's
purpose.
it
makes
no
difference
as
to
whether
there
is
an
obligation
to
file
for
pre-clearance
under
section
5
because
that
obligation
was
triggered
only
by
the
decision
to
make
an
annexation,
not
by
a
decision
not
to
make
an
annexation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
there
is
no
present
change,
but
what
we
have
here
is
a--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--if
there
was
never
to
be
a
change,
the
attorney
general
does
not
take
the
position
that
the
city
would
ever
have
to
come
in
and
submit
for
pre-clearance.
if
they
wanted
to
build
an
airport,
if
they
wanted
to
leave
it
as
a
forest
preserve,
that
would
not
trigger
a
voting
change.
but
what
we
have
here
is
the
city
making
an
annexation
for
purposes
of
development
for
residential
housing.
and
because
it
makes
it
much
easier,
apparently,
for
the
city
to
pursue
that
development
to
know
in
advance
that
it
is
part
of
the
city
of
pleasant
grove,
that
it
submitted
for
pre-clearance.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
may
or
may
not.
it
presently,
however,
has
the
potential
to
affect
voters
and
it
is
presently
taken
for
the
purpose
of
enlarging
the
white
electorate
and
fencing
out
the
blacks
living
in
the
environs
of
pleasant
grove.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
you
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
the
city's
purpose.
let
me
say
that
when
it's
suggested
that
the
potential
conduct
may
or
may
never
occur,
is
to
say
that
the
city
must
lose
that
case
because
it
is
the
city's
burden
of
proving
that
its
annexation
will
have
no
effect.
to
say
"may
or
may
not"
is
to
say
the
city
has
not
met
that
burden.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--writing
on
a
clean
slate
here,
the
city
of
pleasant
grove
made
a
similar
annexation
in
1967.
the
history
of
that
development
has
been
with
all
of
the
laws
you
have
just
referred
to,
is
that
in
the
areas
annexed
in
1967
that
have
been
developed,
they
have
provided
residential
housing
for
white
people
and
not
for
black
people.
so,
when
this
submission--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--in
every
section
5
case
there
is
always
a
chance
that
the
effect
that
the
court
looks
at
from
the
statistics
may
not
occur.
section
5
is
a
pre-clearance
statute.
the
determination
is
made
before
the
changes
go
into
effect.
there
is
never
an
actual
effect
in
a
section
5
case.
there
is
always
some
measure
of
prediction.
we
are
saying
that
in
this
case,
based
on
this
record
and
what
the
district
court
regarded
as
the
astonishing
hostility
to
the
rights
of
black
americans,
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
make
that
determination
here,
that
the
city's
purpose
rightly
or
wrongly
in
terms
of
what
the
future
may
bring
in
terms
of...
into
this
area,
that
its
present
purpose
was
to
enlarge
the
white
electorate,
to
fence
out
black
voters
so
that
should
any
blacks
move
into
pleasant
grove
their
votes...
they
would
be
an
even
smaller
minority
than
they
are
today.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
city
was
building
on
a
history
of
some
40
years
in
which
there
were
no
blacks
who
lived
in
pleasant
grove.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
yes,
it
did.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
said,
not
only
has
the
city
failed
to
carry
its
burden
but
that
even
had
the
burden
been
on
the
government,
that
the
result
would
have
been
no
different,
that
there
was
clearly
a
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
the
annexation
and
in
the
city's
implementation
of
its
annexation
policy
of
enlarging
the
white
electorate
and
fencing
out
the
black
electorate.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
there
are
two
annexations.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
these
annexations.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
court
weighed
all
of
those
as
probative
evidence
of
the
purpose,
and
the
court
then
found
that
the
city
has
a
discriminatory
annexation
policy
that
it
implemented
in
these
two
cases.
if
we
had
a
city,
that
for
example,
that
was
going
and
annexing
individual
houses,
one
at
a
time,
and
it
turned
out
that
they
were
only
houses
that
white
people
lived
in,
you
might...
and
it
sought
pre-clearance,
you
might
look
at
each
one
and
say,
well,
we
can't
see
that
annexing
this
one
house
with
a
few
people
in
it
makes
much
of
a
difference.
but
when
you
look
at
the
pattern
and
you
see
what
the
policy
is,
that
it's
creating
this
checkerboard
and
that
they've
had
500
similar
annexations
like
this,
there
comes
a
time
when
it's
fair
to
say
that
we
know
what's
going
on
here
and
we
know
what
the
purpose
is.
and,
while
the
consequence
is
simply
that
this
annexation
is
not
permitted,
it
is
certainly
available
to
the
attorney
general
and
to
the
court
to
weigh
the
probative
evidence
indicating
the
city's
purpose.
