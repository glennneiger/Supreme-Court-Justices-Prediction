william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
corcoran.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
part
of
the
record,
then;
it's
a
part
of
the
deposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
much
consolation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
corcoran.
we'll
resume
argument
now
in
city
of
pleasant
grove
versus
united
states.
you
may
continue,
mr.
corcoran.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
corcoran,
this
evidence
that
you
are
referring
to
now,
i
take
it
you
cite
it
to
show
the
absence
of
a
discriminatory
intent
or
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
city
council?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
district
court
found
otherwise.
if
we
should
say
that
that
finding
isn't
clearly
erroneous,
do
you
nonetheless...
did
you
lose
your
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
we
find
that
the
district
court's
finding
on
this
question
of
purpose
was
not
clearly
erroneous,
and
that
the
city
council
did
act
in
on
or
more
of
these
transactions
with
a
discriminatory
intent,
does
that
mean
you
lose
your
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
is
that?
why
is
the
presence
of
discriminatory
intent
with
respect
to
a
couple
of
those
annexations
controlling,
but
not
with
respect
to
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
not
a
voting
rights
act--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ganzfried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tell
me,
were
there
people
in
both
the
western
addition
and
the
glasgow
annexation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
did
the
annexation
dilute
anyone's
voting
rights?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what's
the
effect
of
this
step?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ganzfried.
mr.
corcoran,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
nine
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
spoke
in
the
subjunctive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
corcoran.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-1244,
city
of
pleasant
grove
versus
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
