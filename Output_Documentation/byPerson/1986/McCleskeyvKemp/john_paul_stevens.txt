justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
general
westmoreland,
do
you
agreement
that
it's
a
mid-range
case?
that
are
a
lot
of...
a
fair
number
of
comparable
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
was
not
imposed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
death
penalty
is
supportable
in
mid-range
cases.
are
there
other
cases,
a
fair
number
of
other
cases,
that
you
would
agree
are
comparable
to
this
in
which
the
death
penalty
is
not
imposed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
your
opponents
were
right
on
this
issue
for
the
purposes
of
its
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
take
the
case
then
as
one
on
which
we
basically
assume
it's
a
factual
matter,
and
we're
reviewing
findings,
or
we
have
a
legal
question,
where
we
assume
basically
that
the
study
is
sound,
and
then
the
question
is
whether
it
raises
a
legal
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
we
disagreed,
just
as
a
hypothesis,
if
we
disagreed
with
the
legal
conclusions
of
the
court
of
appeals,
would
we
not
have
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say,
well,
let's
find
out
if
you're
right
about
the
study
or
your
opponents
are
right
about
the
study?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can
we
be
100
percent
confident
that
all
of
the
cases
with
identical
facts,
that
the
death
penalty
is
imposed?
that's
basically
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
can,
in
effect,
say
the
findings
are
right,
and
just
affirm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you,
if
they
argue,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there's
eleven
times
as
great
a
chance
if
you
have
a
white
victim
than
a
black
victim,
even
though,
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
substantially
black
victim
cases
than
there
are
white
victim
cases.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
out
of
some
1,500
black
victim
cases,
there
are
a
total
of
20
death
sentences.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
out
of
about
970
white
victim
cases,
there
are
over
100
death
sentences.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
all
of
that
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
white
victim
cases
are
consistently
the
more
serious?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
westmoreland?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
i
understand
your
position
that
the
study
is
insufficient,
and
that
perhaps
it's
impossible
to
really
get
to
the
bottom
of
something
like
this.
but
assume
for
a
moment
that
we
had
a
really...
an
ideal
statistician
whom
everybody
could
agree
was
sound
and
came
to
the
right
answers
and
took
account
of
all
variables;
and
that
after
doing
all
that
in
a
reliable
way
he
concluded
that
if
the
victim
was
white,
there
was
eleven
times
greater
chance
than
if
the
victim
was
black
that
the
death
penalty
would
be
imposed.
would
that
raise
a
constitutional
question
in
your
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
that
present
a
prima
facie
case
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
my
hypothetical
is
that
we
have
this
ideal
statistician
who
accomplished
the
task
that
you
say
is
impossible;
and
you
may
very
well
be
correct.
but
if
we
had
such
an
answer
to
the
factual
question,
would
there
be
a
legal
question
raised
in
your
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
eleven
times
as
great.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
asking
you
what
your
view
is.
what
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
georgia
on
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
it
was
20
percent,
20
to
1?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
in
the
view
of
the
state
of
georgia
is
an
acceptable
percentage
variation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
they
say,
when
you
make
the
adjustment,
it
reduces
it
to
four
times
instead
of
eleven
times.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn't
you
agree,
ms.
westmoreland,
that
the
georgia
system
does
allow
a
greater
room
for
discretion
than
some
of
the
other
states
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
arguably,
it
allows
the
jury
to
take
into
consideration,
as
a
mitigating
circumstance,
that
the
victim
was
black.
