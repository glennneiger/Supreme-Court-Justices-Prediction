chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
84-6811,
warren
mccleskey
versus
ralph
kemp.
mr.
boger,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
paid
by
your
organization,
though?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
your
organization?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
boger,
don't
you
have
to
show
that
this
particular
jury
discriminated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
particular
jury
was
only
convened
once.
and
i
think
you
have
to
show
under
our
cases
that
this
particular
jury
would
have
dealt
differently
with
a
black
defendant
who
killed
a
black
person.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
a
pattern
on
the
part
of
this
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
was
there
any...
did
the
constitutional
holding
in
bazemore
support
your
position,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
when
you're...
the
institution
that
you're
challenging
is
the
jury
here.
and
it's
the
jury
in
this
defendant's
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
do
you
think
your
evidence
supports
a
finding
that
this
particular
prosecutor,
who
prosecuted
this
case,
discriminates
as
between
blacks
who've
killed
whites
and
blacks
who've
killed
blacks?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
you
say
your
evidence
supports
a
finding
that
this
particular
prosecutor,
in
doing
what
you
say,
discriminated
in
the
manner
i
described?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
do
you
think
your
evidence
would
support
a
finding
as
to
this
particular
prosecutor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
boger.
ms.
westmoreland,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
westmoreland,
one
difference
certainly
between
title
vii
analysis
and
this
kind
of
case
is
that
under
title
vii
you
can
gain
relief
in
some
situations
by
simply
proving
disparate
impact.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
westmoreland.
mr.
boger,
your
time
expired
even
as
you
were
in
the
act
of
reserving
it.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
84-6811,
mccleskey
against
kemp
will
be
announced
by
justice
powell.
