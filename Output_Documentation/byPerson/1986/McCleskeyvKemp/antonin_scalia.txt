there
was
an
other
aggravating
factor
too,
wasn't
there?
wasn't
the
shot
which
the
police
officer
suffered,
in
the
head,
was
at
very
close
range,
indicating
that
there
was
a
conscious
attempt
to
kill
the
man?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
boger,
i
assume
that
this
kind
of
statistical
evidence,
if
valid,
with
regard
to
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
would
also
be
valid
with
regard
to
conviction;
so
that
if
you
showed
that
there
is
a
disproportionate
pattern
of
convictions
of
those
who
are
accused
of
killing
white
victims,
or
of
black
defendants,
the
same
problem
would
arise?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
not
just
prosecutors,
but
juries.
i
mean,
part
of
this
was
the
jury
action
as
well
as
the
prosecutor's
seeking.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
also
assume
that
it's
wrong
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
but
on
the
basis
of
any
other
unchangeable
physical
characteristic,
so
that
you
wouldn't
say
we
can
convict
people
more
readily
because
they're
ugly,
or
because
they're
shifty-eyed.
now,
what
if
you
do
a
statistical
study
that
shows
beyond
question
that
people
who
are
naturally
shifty
eyed
are
to
a
disproportionate
extent,
convicted
in
criminal
cases?
does
that
make
the
criminal
process
unlawful?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
suppose...
what
procedure
could
have
been
inserted
that
would
have
solved
that
problem,
other
than
the
one
that
justice
o'connor
has
suggested,
that
is,
going
back
to
a
rigid
system
where
a
certain
crime,
felony
murder,
produces
the
death
penalty?
that
would
certainly
solve
the
problem.
what
short
of
that
would
solve
the
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
those
variables
not
taken
account
of
in
the
study?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't...
well,
does
it
eliminate
any
qualitative
differences
attributable
to
the
two
factors
you
just
mentioned?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can't
imagine
that
one
of
the
variables
wouldn't
be
whether
the
case
involved
a
family
dispute
or
a
barroom
brawl
or
an
intentional
felony.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that
last
point.
why
is
this
different
from
title
vii?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
certainly
on
the
theoretical
point
of
whether
statistical
evidence
can
properly
be
used,
assuming
it's
reliable,
as
evidence
of...
prima
facie
evidence
of
discrimination
in
the
particular
case,
there's
no
basis
for
distinguishing
this
from
the
title
vii
situation,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
the
statistical
evidence.
but
as
to
the
principal
of
whether
statistical
evidence
is
a
valid
indication
of...
assuming
it's
valid
statistical
evidence...
is
a
valid
indication
of
discrimination
in
a
particular
case,
there's
no
difference
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
a
factual
matter
mostly,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
should
go
with
the
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
the
court
had
found
the
other
way
and
accepted
the
statistical
evidence,
in
the
next
case,
then
we
would
likewise
go
with
the
district
court.
