ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
presented
to
the
court
today
are
three
central
issues
regarding
the
georgia
death
penalty
scheme.
initially,
we're
concerned
with
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
statistical
analysis,
both
in
this
case
in
particular,
and
in
the
death
penalty
context
as
a
whole.
secondly,
were
the
standards
to
be
applied
in
evaluating
the
eighth
amendment
claim
has
been
raised,
and
whether
an
eighth
amendment
claim
has
actually
been
substantiated.
and
thirdly,
the
question
of
an
alleged
equal
protection
violation;
and
whether
that
claim
has
also
been
substantiated
by
the
facts
of
the
case.
to
begin
with,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
a
few
facts
that
i
think
are
pertinent
for
consideration.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
mr.
mccleskey's
case
was
characterized
by
this
study
as
a
mid-range
case.
these
are
the
facts
which
constitute
a
mid-range
case
under
the
study
in
question:
a
police
officer
killing,
involved
during
an
armed
robbery,
with
co-perpetrators,
in
broad
daylight,
in
a
store
in
which
approximately
seven
people
were
hostage,
all
of
whom
were
forced
to
lie
on
the
floor,
many
of
whom
were
tied
up
during
the
commission
of
this
crime.
we
have
two
shots
fired
at
the
police
officer.
the
first
hit
him
in
the
eye;
the
fatal
shot.
the
second
shot
fired
happened
to
bounce
off
a
cigarette
lighter
which
was
in
his
pocket.
the
testimony
at
trial
indicated
that
would
have
been
directly
over
his
heart.
and
there
was
also
some
indication,
and
the
prosecutor
argued,
that
there
was
at
least
an
inference
that
could
be
drawn,
that
the
police
officer
was
already
on
the
floor
at
the
time
the
second
shot
was
fired.
there
is
no
question
that
the
person
committing
this
act
intended
that
the
killing
be
done.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
no
mitigating
evidence
was
presented
at
the
sentencing
phase
in
this
case
whatsoever,
your
honor.
what
we
have
is
a
situation
in
which
the
evidence
was
presented
to
show
that
mr.
mccleskey
had
three
prior
convictions
for
armed
robbery.
he
was
also
connected
to
two
other
robberies
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
one
of
which
involved
the
stealing
of
the
weapon
which
was
identified,
as
being
the
murder
weapon
in
this
case;
a
second
of
which
related
to
the
arrest
which
led
up
to
his
confession
or
statements
in
this
case.
we
also
have
the
testimony
of
two
victims
from
the
furniture
store
robbery
who
identified
mr.
mccleskey.
we
have
the
testimony
of
mr.
mccleskey's
co-perpetrator,
who
places
mr.
mccleskey
as
the
only
one
of
the
four
participants
in
the
area
of
the
store
who
could
have
fired
the
fatal
shots.
and
we
finally
have
the
testimony
of
another
inmate
who
heard
mr.
mccleskey
bragging
about
the
killing,
and
even
stating
to
the
effect
that
if
12
more
police
officers
had
come
in,
he
would
have
done
the
same
thing
and
shot
his
way
out.
these
are
facts
that
under
this
study
constitute
a
mid-range
case.
based
on
those
factors
alone,
we
would
submit
that
the
study
itself
certainly
causes
great
questions
to
be
raised
about
its
validity.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
do
not
agree
that
it's
a
mid-range
case.
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
certainly
supported
the
death
penalty
in
this
circumstance.
and
i
think
it
is
a
most
aggravated
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
supports
that
finding
whatsoever.
there
is
no
showing
that
cases
that
are
actually
factually
comparable
to
this
case
did
not
receive
a
death
penalty.
there's
some
indication
that
some
police
officer
killings
did
not
receive
a
death
penalty,
or
even
some
police
officer
killings
with
an
armed
robbery
did
not
receive
a
death
penalty.
those
two
facts
alone
don't
make
these
cases
factually
similar.
as
i've
noted,
all
of
the
previous
other
facts
which
serve
to
make
this
case
that
much
more
aggravated.
the
mid-range
case,
and
the
mid-range
analysis
done
in
this
case,
does
not
compare
factually
similar
cases.
and
a
reading
of
the
testimony
indicates,
this
is
simply
an
aggravation
level,
using
regression
analyses,
that
comes
up
with
a
weight
to
be
attached
to
this
case.
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
cases
in
this
so-called
mid-range
are
factually
similar
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
never
even
asserted
that
they
were
factually
similar.
it
was
simply
asserted
that
once
the
regression
analysis
was
conducted,
based
on
one
particular
regression,
that
the
aggravation
level,
if
you
will,
that
was
derived
from
that
regression
was
similar
for
these
cases;
no
indication
as
to
whether
they
had
similar
aggravating
circumstances;
similar
mitigating
circumstances;
or
anything
of
this
sort.
so
we
would
simply
assert
that
there
was
no
showing
that
similar
cases,
factually
similar
cases,
have
not
received
a
death
sentence
in
this
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
the
district
court
did.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
in
this
respect,
the
eleventh
circuit
did
note
that
they
felt
that
there
had
really
been
no
showing
that
there
was
actually
a
mid-range
of
cases
that--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--of
similar
factual
nature;
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did
was,
on
several
occasions
throughout
its
opinion,
stated
that
they
were
assuming
the
validity
of
the
study.
when
the
reached
the
discussion
of
the
mid-range
of
cases,
the
court,
in
addition
to
concluding
that
legally
there
was
no
basis
for
a
finding
of
discrimination,
also
noted
that
they
did
not
see
that
it
had
been
established
that
there
was
a
mid-range
of
cases,
or
that
there
had
not
been
proven
that
there
was
such
a
mid-range
of
cases.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
can
take
either
one
of
two
approaches.
obviously,
we
have
two
totally
different
opinions
from
the
district
court
and
the
eleventh
circuit
in
that
regard.
we
would
submit
that
the
factual
findings
by
the
district
court
are
subjected
to
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
and
they
have
never
been
overturned.
the
eleventh
circuit,
in
fact,
at
one
point
complimented
the
district
court
on
its
thorough
analysis
and
noted
that
it
would
have
to
deal
with
these
factual
findings.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
that's
obviously
one
possible
alternative.
we
would
submit
that
the
record
is
so
clear
on
this
point
that
it
is
obvious
that
no
intention
discrimination
has
been
shown.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i'm
submitting
that
what
has
not
been
shown
is
that
there
are
similar
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
has
not
been
imposed.
and
once
again,
that's
not
even
the
question
that
we're
focussing
on
here.
that
still
doesn't
mean
there's
intention
discrimination
in
this
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
excuse
me,
your
honor.
but
i
would
submit
that
the
court
can
make
this;
decision
without
resorting
to
a
remand
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
certainly,
your
honor.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
a
few
factors
to
the
court
in
relation
to
this
study
that
has
been
highly
touted
by
the
petitioners,
and
by
others,
and
related
to
be
an
extremely,
quote,
accurate
and
complete
study,
and
note
to
the
court
that
as
the
district
court
found,
this
study
is
far
from
either
accurate,
and
it
is
also
far
from
being
complete.
it
has
been
asserted
that
there
were
500
variables
collected.
and
just
a
brief
examination
of
the
record
will
show
that
it
was
attempted--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
what...
the
state
took
two
approaches
in
its
presentation
to
the
district
court.
first
was
a
challenge
to
the
data
base
methodology,
the
manner
of
collection
information,
and
that
type
of
information.
the
state
secondly
but
on
a
counter
hypothesis,
if
you
will;
that
is,
based
on
the
study
itself,
white
victim
cases
are
systematically--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes,
your
honor.
we
had
two
statisticians
testify
on
behalf
of
the
state.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
statisticians
who
had
run
analysis
of
the
data
that
we
were
given
from
professor
baldus.
we
did
not
go
out
and
obtain
new
data
on
each
individual
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
not
in
the
sense
of
obtaining
new
data.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
no,
your
honor,
we
presented--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
that
was
my
point.
we
do
have...
we
had
the
two
statisticians
who
did
testify
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
in
this
action.
we
gave
various
challenges
to
the
data
base
itself;
the
manner
in
which
the
data
base
was
actually
put
together;
the
methodology
utilized
in
analyzing
the
data
base,
based
on
the
various
problems
with
that
data
base;
as
well
as
going
through
and
doing
a
complete
analysis,
based
on
this
same
data
base,
of
all
the
cases,
based
on
different
sentencing
outcomes,
based
on
different
aggravating
circumstances,
and
various
other
factors,
in
an
examination
across
the
board,
shows
that
within
each
of
these
facets,
white
victim
cases
are
qualitatively
different
from
black
victim
cases.
they
tend
to
have
more
factors
such
as
armed
robberies,
rapes;
more
property
motivated
types
of
crimes.
the
black
victim
cases,
on
the
other
hand,
based
on
the
data
presented
by
the
petitioner,
tend
to
arise
in
more
circumstances
involving
such
things
as
a
family
dispute;
a
barroom
quarrel,
if
you
will.
and
these
things
occurred
throughout
the
various
sentencing
stages,
and
throughout,
as
we
noted...
under
different
aggravating
circumstances,
and
in
various
categories
of
cases;
and
is
a
systematic
difference,
which
we
would
submit,
certainly
accounts
for
any
disparity
that
may
exist
in
the
sentencing
process
itself.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
the
variables
are
taken
into
account
in
some
of
the
analyses.
but
our
submission
to
the
district
court
was
that
based
upon
the
fact
that
across
the
board
the
white
victim
cases
still
remained
systematically
worse;
that
you
simply
can't
eliminate
this
difference
by
taking
into
account
even
the
230
variables
that
they
did
utilize
in
one
particular
analysis.
that
still
doesn't
eliminate
the
qualitative
difference
in
the
cases
that
were
examined.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
those
two--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--those
are
included
in
some
of
the
analyses
submitted
into
the
district
court,
yes,
your
honor;
those
particular
ones
are.
and
we
submitted
numerous
tables
to
the
district
court
examining
many
variables,
several
hundred
variables,
utilized
by
professor
baldus,
showing
where
they
fell
more
in
white
victim
cases,
as
opposed
to
black
victim
cases.
and
our...
the
bottom
line
submitted
by
the
respondent
is,
you
cannot
come
up
with
two
similar
cases
to
compare;
because
each
case
is
unique
on
its
own
individual
facts.
in
making...
in
attempting
to
any
type
of
analysis
of
this
regard,
you
simply
cannot
find
two
cases
that
are
sufficiently
similar
to
be
able
to
say
that
race
is
the
one
factor
that
causes
that
death
sentence,
either
from
a
jury
or
from
a
prosecutor.
in
regard
to--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct
as
well,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct,
your
honor;
that's
our
submission,
that
in
examining
these
cases,
out
of
the
black
victim
cases
i
believe
you'll
find
perhaps
over
a
thousand
occur
in
something
like
a
family
dispute,
a
lover
dispute,
a
fight
involving
liquor
of
some
sort,
where
some...
one
party
is
drunk
or
the
other
party
is
drunk.
those
types
of
disputes
occur
so
frequently
in
black
victim
cases
that
they
do
tend
to
fall
out
of
the
system
much
earlier,
and...
leaving
the
much
more
aggravated,
the
more
highly
aggravated
white
victim
cases,
involving
armed
robberies,
and
such
things
as
property
disputes.
and
for
whatever
reason,
frequently
more
times
we'll
see
torture
cases
involving
white
victim
cases
than
you
do
in
black
victim
cases.
but
once
again,
yes,
that
is
accounted
for
by
the
qualitative
difference
in
the
two
types
of
cases,
as
well.
one
point
has
been
made
in
relation--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
we
submit
the
study
does
not
show
what
it
purports
to
show;
and
that
is,
intention
racial
discrimination
in
this
case,
as
a
first
point.
as
has
been
noted
by
the
court,
that
is
one
of
the
standards
used
in
equal
protection
cases
in
particular.
and
there
has
been
absolutely
no
indication
that
this
jury
and
this
prosecutor
engaged
in
any
type
of
intentional
discrimination.
in
fact,
as
noted
previously,
the
facts
of
this
case
certainly
would
dispute
any
such
attempt
at
an
inference
under
the
circumstances.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
one
of
the
more
important
considerations
is
the
type
of
case
we're
dealing
with.
certainly,
this
court
has
relied
on
statistical
evidence
in
other
contexts,
primarily
jury
composition
cases
and
title
vii
statutory
proceedings.
this
case,
based
on
what
justice
o'connor
has
already
noted,
the
unique
circumstances
and
the
wide
range
of
mitigating
factors
available,
does
not
lend
itself
readily
to
the
type
of
analysis
used
here,
the
multiple
regression
type
of
analysis,
in
which
this
court
has
time,
and
time
again,
noted
that
what
the
jury
is
doing,
first
of
all,
is
expressing
the
moral
outrage
of
the
community--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
the
shifts
us
into
essentially
a
selective
prosecution
type
of
argument.
and
the
court
has
also
noted
on
other
occasions
that
the
prosecutor
does
have
broad
discretion
in
which
cases
to
present
to
a
jury
and
which
cases
to
pursue
throughout
the
system.
and
certain
which
simply
are
not
included
in
this
study--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--certainly
not,
your
honor.
that's
not
really
the
point.
the
point
is,
though,
that
there
are
so
many
subjective
factors
involved
in
the
prosecutor's
exercise
of
discretion
that
they
simply
cannot
be
quantified
and
utilized
in
a
multiple
regression
type
of
analysis.
the
prosecutor
automatically
considers
not
just
the
strength
of
the
evidence
of
the
case,
but
the
credibility
of
each
and
every
witness
that
he
has,
the
availability
of
the
witnesses,
whether
some
may
not
be
able
to
come
to
trial,
whether
a
witness
is
going
to
fall
apart
under
cross-examination,
his
own
case
load
pressure
certainly
is
a
factor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
what
it
does
is
create
the
question
of,
have
we
raised
of
inference
of
discrimination
such
as
to
present
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
once
again,
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
because
we
would
submit
that
there
is
simply
no
way
to
take
account
of
all
those
variables.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
it
once
again
gets
back
to,
in
that
case,
is
11
percent
going
to
be
enough
to
raise
a
prima
facie
case
inference
of
discrimination.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
this
court
has
been
hesitant
to
set--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
an
11
percent
disparity--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--then
you've
moving
closer
to
a
prima
facie
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
state
of
georgia
has
a
precise
view
as
to
any
acceptable
percentage
of
variation
one
way
or
the
other.
certainly,
there
could
come
a
time,
assuming
your
honor's
hypothetical
of
course,
where
the
variation
could
become
so
broad
that
you're
presented
with
a
situation
as
in
yick
wo
or
gamillion
v.
lightfoot,
where
there's
simply
no
other
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn.
or
you
have
the
inexorable
zero
situation.
this
is
far
from
that
type
of
a
situation.
we
simply
don't
have
that
type
of
a
disparity.
the
11
percent
disparity,
i
would
note,
in
this
case,
that's
referred
to,
is
done
on
an
unadjusted
analysis
not
considering
any
other
factors
except
the
simply
fact
that
this
is
white
victim
cases
versus
black
victim
cases.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
and
we
would
note
to
the
court
that
also
makin
these
various
adjustments
continually
reduces
the
statistical
significance
that
can
be
attached
to
that
regression
coefficient.
one
thing
that
the
eleventh
circuit
focussed
on,
and
i
think
needs
to
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
as
well,
is
the.06
and
the
6
percentage
question.
and
the...
once
again,
the
same
4
percent
number
that
has
been
referred
to.
these
are
regression
coefficients.
they
are
not...
necessarily
mean
anything
more
that
a
weight
that
is
attached
in
a
computer
analysis
to
a
particular
variable
that
the
computer's
given
to
work
with.
all
the
computer
is
trying
to
do
is
to
make
the
predicted
outcome
equal
the
actual
outcome;
either
a
death
sentence
case
or
a
life
sentence
case,
depending
on
what
information
you
give
it,
what
variables
you
give
it
to
work
with.
as
was
noted,
these
coefficients
change,
depending
on
what's
included
in
each
individual
analysis,
a
coefficient
may
go
up,
it
may
go
down,
it
just
varies
completely.
and
it's
not
really
adequate
to
be
utilized
on
its
face
to
show
any
type
of
disparity.
professor
baldus
himself
testified
on
three
separate
occasions
that
the
regression
coefficient
was...
referred
to
it
as
being
"rough"
when
he
was
talking
about
trying
to
plot
it
within
some
of
the
other
variables
in
the
analysis.
he
said,
now
this
is
just
an
estimate;
it's
a
rough
estimate:
it
should
be
utilized
as
just
a
rough
estimate
and
approached
with
some
caution
in
what
you
do
with
this
particular
regression
coefficient.
the
statisticians
that
we
presented
also
testified
that
other
problems
with
the
data
caused
problems
in
how
to
interpret
the
coefficient
itself.
this
6
percent
number
that
has
been
referred
to
time
and
time
again.
one
word
that
was
thrown
around
an
awful
lot
in
the
district
court
and
subsequent
proceedings
is
the
concept
of
multicolinearity.
essentially
the
problem
is
that
there
are
well
over
a
hundred
variables
in
this
analysis
that
are
highly
correlated
with
death
sentencing
outcome
and
the
racial
variables.
what
this
does
is
effect
the
coefficient
itself,
and
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
respondent's
experts,
can
make
the
coefficient
essentially
distorted
and
impossible
to
interpret.
it
can
be
a
positive
coefficient
when
it
should
be
negative;
the
number
can
be
higher
than
it
should
be
or
lower
than
it
should
be.
essentially
what
you
have
is
a
number
that,
based
on
the
various
problems
with
the
data
base,
is
not
interpretable
in
this
type
of
a
context.
in
question...
in
relating
to
the
question
of
statistical
analysis
itself,
as
noted
previously,
we
would
submit
that
statistical
analysis
is
not
appropriate
in
this
type
of
factual
situation
involving
so
many
individualized
and
unique
factors
in
each
individual
case,
when
what
the
court
is
trying
to
do
is
examine
a
community's
expression
of
its
moral
outrage
at
a
given
offense.
the
jury
is
also
trying
to
make
an
individualized
determination
of
each
individual
capital
defendant.
and
the
court
has
noted
on
many
occasions
that
the
jury
considers
subjective
factors
in
making
this
analysis
that
are
very
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
quantify
and
put
in
any
type
of
analysis
of
this
sort.
in
fact,
in
caldwell
v.
mississippi,
the
court
focussed
on
the
fact
that
the
jury
was
considering
intangible
things
that
were
not
readily
picked
out
of
an
appellate
record
in
the
case.
it's
quite
different
from
circumstances
such
as
jury
selection,
when
the
court's
focussing
on
a
narrow
process
involving
a
given
disparity
between
the
population
in
the
jury
pool,
and
a
very
few
qualifications
that
are
being
considered
by
the
jury
commissioners;
and
also
considering
usually
one
set
of
persons
making
a
decision,
one
set
of
jury
commissioners;
may
be
two;
as
opposed
to
a
different
jury
for
each
case
that
comes
along.
in
addition
to
that,
it's
somewhat
different
from
a
title
vii
analysis.
once
again,
although
there
are
more
factors
considered
in
the
title
vii
analysis,
it's
not
the
same
type
of
subjective
evaluation
that
is
made
by
a
jury
and
by
a
prosecutor
in
a
death
penalty
context
as
well.
additionally--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
although
title
vii
does
certainly
involve
more
factors
than
a
simple
jury
selection
process
could,
for
instance,
normally
under
employment
situation,
you're
going
to
have
an
employer
focussing
on
a...
a
few
specific
things
that
are
the
main
points
being
utilized
in
evaluating
whether
or
not
to
hire
a
given
employee.
certain
they're
going
to
be,
in
any
given
case,
some
subjective
factors.
put
it's
not
the
same
type
of
focus
that
is
being
utilized
when
we've
got
a
jury
looking
at
a
unique
case,
a
unique
individual,
in
which
the
jury
can
consider
as
mitigating,
and
determine
to
essential
afford
mercy
to
a
defendant
based
on
anything
that
it
chooses
that
is
present
in
the
record
before
the
jury.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
that
our
point
is
that
the
difference
is,
the
number
of
subjective
factors
that
necessarily
come
into
play
in
the
jury's
decision-making
process.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
well,
to
that
extent,
your
honor
is
probably
correct.
but
the
point
being
that
in
this
type
of
case,
it
is
going
to
be
such
that
even
if
a
statistical
analysis
is
done,
it
is
going
to
be
virtually
probative
of
nothing,
due
to
the
fact
that
it's
simply
going
to
be-unreliable.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
this
is
true,
your
honor,
of
course.
and
in
this
case,
we're
simply
far
from
simply
disparate
impact,
as
the
court
has
already
noted.
the
question
is
intention
discrimination.
and
we
would
submit,
the
question
is
intention
discrimination
by
this
jury
and
by
this
prosecutor,
and
that
it
simply
has
not
been
shown
under
the
facts
in
this
case.
it
has
been
asserted
that
we
are
attempting
to
change
the
equal
protection
standard
somehow,
to
make
it
different
in
a
death
penalty
context.
the
point
simply
is
that
in
this
case,
based
on
what
has
been
presented,
there
is
insufficient
evidence
to
draw
the
inference
of
discrimination
that
this
court
has
drawn
in
other
contexts.
we're
not
seeking
to
change
the
standard;
simply
to
apply
to
the
given
facts
and
circumstances
presented
before
the
court.
to
require
the
petitioner
to
simply
carry
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
petitioner
always
has
in
an
equal
protection
context.
and
our
assertion
has
simply
been
that
there
simply
has
not
been
that
establishment
of
a
prima
facie
case;
or,
even
if
that
case
was
met,
certainly
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof
was
not
met
by
the
petitioner.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
that's
our
submission,
certainly.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
if
the
district
court
had
accepted
the
statistical
evidence,
accepted
the
validity
of
it,
certainly
that
would
be
a
factual
finding
of
intentional
discrimination,
which
under
42(a)
does
apply
in
this
type
of
circumstance,
yes.
we
finally
submit
to
the
court
that
the
petitioners
have
attempted
essentially
to
indict
the
entire
georgia
criminal
justice
system
by
the
presentation
to
the
district
court
and
the
presentation
to
this
court.
that
simply
has
not
been
done.
the
evidence
in
the
case
does
not
show
either
intentional
discrimination;
not
does
it
show
any
type
of
arbitrariness
or
capriciousness
in
the
death
sentencing
scheme
in
the
state
of
georgia.
georgia
has
a
valid
statutory
scheme
that
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
on
numerous
occasions.
it
was
validly
applied
in
this
case,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
to
mr.
mccleskey.
if
anything,
the
evidence
presented
in
this
case
shows
that
the
system
works;
not
that
it
does
not
work.
both
experts
for
the
petitioner
testified
the
system
was
not
random.
it
certainly
sorted
cases--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does
allow
more
discretion,
which
also
works
to
the
benefit
of
the
defendant
in
any
given
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
georgia
allows
mercy
to
be
extended
more
often
than
many
states
would
allow.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
arguably
it
would,
your
honor.
but
what
it
also
does
it
allow
the
jury
to
consider
any
number
of
other
thing
in
mitigation.
and
to
extend
mercy
in
any
given
case.
and
as
this
court
has
held,
there
is
no
constitutional
prohibition
against
a
jury
extending
in
any
given
case.
thus
we
submit
to
the
court
that,
as
noted
previously,
the
georgia
death
penalty
system
is
working
as
it
should
work;
is
working
as
this
court
anticipated
it
would
in
gregg
v.
georcia;
and
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
meet
his
burden
of
proof.
