justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
evidence
is
addressed,
of
course,
as
i
understand
it,
to
the
victim;
discrimination
in
the
sense
of
discrimination
against
the
victim.

independent.
you
didn't
get
any
independent

justice
thurgood
marshall

what
basis
do
you
have
for
saying
that
this
material
missed
the
mark?
it's
just
on
your...
the
state's
lawyers
and

set
themselves
up
as
experts
on
statistics?

did
you
