justice
byron
r.
white
who
took
the
information
from
those
sources?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
asked
you
who
did
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
went
out
and
talked?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
there
were...
who
read
trial
transcripts
and
purported
to
extract
information
from
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
still
want
to
know,
who
read
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
any
of
them
law
graduates?
justice
byron
r.
white
sooner
or
later.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
next
study?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
professor
baldus
relied
on
their
interpretation
of
trial
transcripts,
or
on
whatever
records
they
were
looking
at,
as
to
whether
some
factor
was
present
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
the
trial
court
thought
there
was
a
serious
question
in
that
regard?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
he,
for
example,
i
thought
he
thought
all
those...
a
great
many
of
those
"u"
indications
were
erroneous.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let...
he
may
have
misunderstood
it.
but
he
thought...
he
did
think
that
they...
a
lot
of
them
were
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
he
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
he
thought
the
coding
had
been
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
the
district
court
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
your
organization
working
with
professor
baldus?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
make
some
suggestions
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
were
plea
bargaining?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
hard
to
claim
discrimination
against
mccleskey
at
the
plea
bargaining
stage
in
this
case.
he
was
offered
a
plea
bargain
and
turned
it
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
really?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
was
no
offer,
but
there
was
a
reluctance
on
mr.
mccleskey's
part
to
consider
a
plea
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
district
court
agree
with
you
in
this
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
didn't
the
court
of
appeals...
it
didn't
generally
review
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
but
in
this
particular
respect,
it
seemed
to
agree
with
the
district
court--
justice
byron
r.
white
--about
the
mid-range
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
similar...
of
similar
cases?
