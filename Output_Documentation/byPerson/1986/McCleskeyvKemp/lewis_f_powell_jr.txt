justice
lewis
f.
powell,

would
they
fall

this
capital
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
case
involves
a
relevance
of
a
complex
statistical
study
in
georgia
that
indicates
generally
that
racial
considerations
may
enter
into
the
capital
sentencing
process
in
some
cases.
in
1978,
mccleskey,
a
black
man,
was
convicted
in
georgia
of
murdering
a
white
police
officer
during
the
robbery
of
a
store.
under
georgia's
bifurcated
sentencing
procedure,
the
jury
recommended
the
death
sentence.
it
found
two
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
to
exist
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mccleskey
offered
no
mitigating
evidence.
the
court
followed
the
jury
recommendation.
mccleskey's
conviction
and
death
sentence
were
affirmed
on
appeal
by
the
georgia
supreme
court.
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
in
federal
district
court,
mccleskey
argued
that
the
entire
georgia
capital
punishment
system
is
administered
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner,
based
on
the
race
of
the
victim
and
to
a
lesser
extent
on
the
race
of
the
defendant.
mccleskey
has
supported
his
claim
with
a
complex
multiple
regression
analysis
called
the
baldus
study.
the
district
court
held
an
extensive
evidentiary
hearing
on
mccleskey's
petition.
it
concluded
that
mccleskey
had
failed
to
show
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
him.
it
found
also
that
the
baldus
study
was
statistically
flowing.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
sitting
en
banc
assume
the
statistical
validity
of
the
baldus
study.
it
nevertheless
held
that
mccleskey
had
not
demonstrated
that
his
sentence
was
in
imposed
in
unconstitutional
manner.
for
the
reasons
stated
on
the
opinion
filed
today
we
affirm.
we
hold
first
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
mccleskey
must
prove
that
the
decision
makers
in
his
case
acted
with
the
discriminatory
purpose.
a
wide
range
of
variables
necessarily
enter
into
in
a
capital
sentencing
determination.
these
must
be
considered
by
the
prosecutor
in
exercising
discretion
whether
or
not
to
prosecute
it.
in
the
end
the
collective
judgment
of
a
jury
determines
the
sentence.
the
generalized
statistics
of
the
baldus
study
failed
to
raise
an
inference
that
mccleskey
was
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
his
race
or
the
race
of
the
victim.
the
study
also
fails
to
support
mccleskey's
claim
that
his
sentence
is
arbitrary
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
in
gregg
against
georgia
this
court
held
that
the
georgia
death
penalty
procedures
properly
channel
a
sentencing
jury's
discretion.
mccleskey's
arguments
are
best
presented
to
legislative
bodies.
capital
punishment
is
a
law
in
more
than
two
thirds
of
our
states.
congress
also
has
authorized
a
death
penalty
for
aircraft
piracy.
it
is
the
duty
of
courts
to
determine
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
whether
these
laws
are
applied
consistently
with
the
constitution.
despite
mccleskey's
wide
range
in
arguments,
had
basically
challenged
the
validity
of
capital
punishment
in
our
multi
racial
society,
the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
in
this
case
in
which
mccleskey's
guilt
has
not
questioned,
the
law
of
georgia
was
properly
applied.
we
agree
with
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
that
this
was
carefully
and
correctly
done
in
this
case.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
marshall

all
but

which
