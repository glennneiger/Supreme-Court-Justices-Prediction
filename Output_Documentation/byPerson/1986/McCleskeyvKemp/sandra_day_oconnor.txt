mr.
boger,
getting
away
from
the
validity
of
the
study
as
such,
and
to
the
constitutional
issue,
if
the
study
is
utilized
to
support
your
proposition,
what
does
a
petitioner
of
a
defendant
have
to
show
for
the
constitutional
violation
under
equal
protection
or
eighth
amendment?
does
he
not
have
to
show
intentional
discrimination
against
this
particular
defendant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
cited
bazemore,
which
of
course
was
a
title
vii
statutory
case.
are
there
cases
involving
a
constitutional
violation
where
the
court
has
relied
on
statistical
proof
of
the
type
you're
suggesting
we
use
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i'm
not
sure
how
that
supports
a
claim
of
discrimination
against
the
defendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
such
a
curious
case,
because
what's
the
remedy?
is
it
to
execute
more
people?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
want
the
court
to
provide,
then,
abolition
of
the
death
penalty
altogether?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
statutory
provisions,
you
don't
allege
that
georgia's
death
penalty
statutes
are
unconstitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
females?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
boger,
at
bottom
the
claim
being
made
here
is
a
curious
one,
in
the
sense
that
in
many
death
penalty
cases,
what
the
defendant
comes
forward
asking
for
is
more
opportunities
for
the
exercise
of
mercy,
and
to
allow
juries,
for
whatever
reason,
not
to
impose
a
death
penalty.
and
yet
you
come
forward
with
a
claim
that
says,
in
effect,
not
enough
people...
the
death
penalty
is
not
being
imposed
on
enough
people.
it's
just
a...
it's
a
basic
tension.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
have
a
case
pending
this
term
in
which
we
are
asked
to
reinforce
again
in
the
death
penalty
context
that
juries
have
absolute
discretion
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty
for
whatever
reason.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
this
court's
cases
that
have,
since
furman,
opened
up
to
allow
more
discretion,
were
wrongly
decided,
and
we
should
move
back
toward
less
discretion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
westmoreland?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
this
court
decides
to
simply
address
the
court
of
appeals'
approach,
and
not
deal
with
your
point
about
the
validity
of
the
study,
it's
your
position,
i
take
it,
that
assuming
the
study
is
valid,
it
just
doesn't
show
a
sufficient
level
of
discrimination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
just
ask
you--
--can
statistical
evidence
be
relied
upon
at
all
to
establish
intentional
discrimination,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
about
the
evidence
insofar
as
the
prosecutor
is
concerned,
the
evidence
that
tends
to
show
that
prosecutors
just
aren't
willing
as
often
to
offer
a
plea
bargaining?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
discretion
include
discretion
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race?
