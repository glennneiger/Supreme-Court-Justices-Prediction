mr.
john
charles
boger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
state
of
georgia
had
criminal
statutes
that
expressly
imposed
different
penalties,
harsher
penalties,
on
black
defendants
simply
because
they
were
black,
or
on
those
who
killed
white
victims,
simply
because
those
victims
were
white,
the
statutes
would
plainly
violate
the
constitution.
there
was
a
time,
of
course,
when
the
state
of
georgia
did
have
such
statutes,
before
our
nation's
civil
war,
when
free
blacks
and
slaves
alike
could
be
given
a
death
sentence
merely
for
the
crime
of
assault
on
a
georgia
white
citizen.
with
the
ratification
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
such
criminal
statutes
came
explicitly
no
longer
to
be
written.
yet
the
old
habits
of
mind,
the
racial
attitudes
of
that
time
have
survived,
as
this
court
well
knows,
into
the
current
century.
today,
we
are
before
the
court
with
a
substantial
body
of
evidence
indicating
that
during
the
last
decade
georgia
prosecutors
and
juries,
in
their
administration
of
georgia's
post-furman
capital
statutes,
have
continued
to
act
as
if
some
of
those
old
statutes
were
still
on
the
books.
a
black
defendant
convicted
in
the
state
of
georgia
of
the
murder
of
a
white
person
goes
to
his
sentencing
hearing
with
as
serious
a
handicap
against
him
on
racial
grounds
alone
as
if
the
prosecutor
had
hard
evidence
that
he
had
been
tried
and
convicted
previously
of
another
murder.
the
color
of
a
defendant's
skin,
in
other
words,
or
that
of
his
victim,
is
often
as
grave
an
aggravating
circumstance,
in
fact,
in
georgia,
as
those
expressly
designated
by
georgia's
legislature.
we've
documented
below
the
role
that's
been
played
by
racial
considerations
in
georgia's
capital
sentencing
system.
our
evidence
demonstrates
that
georgia
sentences
the
killers
of
its
white
citizens
at
a
rate
nearly
eleven
times
that
to
which
it
sentences
to
death
the
killers
of
its
black
citizens.
and
even
after
most
of
the
legitimate
sentencing
considerations
had
been
taken
into
account,
a
defendant
remains
over
four
times
likely
to
receive
a
capital
sentence
if
his
victim
chanced
to
be
white.
now
the
sources
of
petitioner's
evidence
below
are
two
meticulous
studies.
they
were
conducted
by
professors
david
baldus
and
george
woodworth.
and
they
have
two
major
strengths
that
i
think
the
court
should
focus
on
at
the
outset.
the
first
strength
is
their
comprehensiveness.
they
provide
us
with
a
thorough
picture
of
how
the
georgia
capital
sentencing
system
operated
during
the
1973-1979
period
covered
by
the
studies.
the
second
feature
of
these
studies
is
the
extraordinary
openness
of
professors
baldus
and
woodworth.
their
indefatigable
willingness
to
entertain
every
criticism,
to
test
every
rival
hypothesis,
to
seize
upon
every
statistical
means
known
to
them
to
take
their
racial
findings
and
shake
them
hard
and
see
if
by
some
statistical
means
or
method,
those
findings
would
drop
out
of
their
analysis.
in
other
words,
professor
baldus
was
not
wedded
at
the
outset
to
any
assumptions
about
what
he
wanted
to
prove.
he
was
open
to
all
comers.
he
was
open
to
the
state.
he
was
open
to
the
court.
indeed,
during
our
evidentiary
hearing
in
1983,
he
invited
the
district
judge,
please
sir,
you
designate
for
us
those
factors
you
think
make
a
difference
in
georgia.
you
tell
us
a
statistical
method.
we
will
with
our
computer
here
run
that
model.
we
will
see
whether
in
the
test
before
the
court
we're
right
that
race
plays
a
part,
or
not.
the
judge
accepted
that
test.
the
data
were
run
under
his
model.
and
indeed,
the
racial
effects,
as
judge
forester
saw
the
system
in
georgia,
actually
increased.
it's
because
professor
baldus
was
wedded
to
no
prior
assumptions;
it's
because
he
subjected
his
statistical
analysis
to
so
many
varieties
of
review;
that
his
studies
provide,
i
believe,
such
a
powerful
indictment
of
the
georgia
system.
now,
one
would
suppose
that
the
state
of
georgia,
faced
with
this
serious
challenge
to
the
administration
of
its
capital
statutes,
would
have
come
forth
with
some
explanation
for
these
racial
disparities.
that's
the
conventional
pattern
in
these
equal
protection
cases
or
eighth
amendment
cases.
some
legitimate
reason
that
might
demonstrate
that
what
appear
to
be
racial
disparities,
racial
discrimination,
actually
is
something
more
benign
operating
in
the
system.
but
georgia
did
not
take
this
step,
either
in
the
year
of
discovery
that
preceded
our
1983
hearing,
or
during
that
hearing
itself,
or
even
in
the
three
years
that
this
case
has
wended
its
way
up
on
appeal.
the
state
certainly
has
not
offered
any
rational
state
interest
that
would
justify
racial
discrimination
in
itself.
but
neither
has
the
state
offered
any
legitimate
sentencing
considerations
that
if
taken
into
account
would
diminish
the
apparent
role
of
race.
it
has
not
come
forward,
as
you
suggested
last
term,
in
the
bazemore
case,
would
be
appropriate,
with
other
statistical
models
to
make
race
go
away.
instead,
georgia's
sole
response
has
been
narrowly
technical
and
methodological.
it
has
launched
an
attack
on
our
data
sources.
it
has
questioned
the
value
of
modern
statistical
analysis
in
this
area.
and
it
has
sought
a
technical
legal
rule.
it
has
sought
to
obtain
in
this
one
area,
the
area
of
capital
sentencing,
a
standard
of
proof
so
high
that
it
has
no
peer
anywhere
else
in
the
law.
now,
its
first
attack
on
petitioner's
data
sources
has
a
kind
of
a
keen
irony
to
it,
because
of
course,
as
you
know
from
the
briefs,
professor
baldus
and
his
colleagues
drew
their
information
from
georgia's
own
official
files,
from
its
police
reports,
from
its
prosecutors'
statements,
from
its
trial
transcripts,
from
its
records
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
these
are
the
very
record
that
georgia
uses
to
prosecute
capital
cases.
mr.
john
charles
boger
they
were
taken
under
the
direction
of
a
coding
supervisor--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
the
second
study
that
professor
baldus
drew
on
primarily
for
his
analysis
came
from
the
georgia
pardons
and
parole
board.
and
the
pardons
and
parole
board
has
officers,
who
are
college
trained,
who
go
out
and
talk
with
the
police
officers
and
the
prosecutors
who
get
files
from
the
police
and
the
prosecutors.
mr.
john
charles
boger
we
had
one
witness
who
testified,
a
mr.
ware,
who
was
one
of
these
officers.
these
are
pardon
and
parole
officials.
mr.
john
charles
boger
there
was
a
first
study
and
a
second
study,
justice
white.
mr.
john
charles
boger
the
first
study,
the
procedural
reform
study,
was
coded
largely
from
information
in
the
files
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
those
files
include
the
trial
transcripts.
so
in
that
first
study
one
of
the
principal
data
sources
were
the
trial
transcripts
themselves.
mr.
john
charles
boger
students,
law
students,
law
graduates;
and
they
read
them
and--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--at
some
point,
i
believe
fred
kyle
was
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
iowa
law
school
and
had
a
political
science
degree.
mr.
john
charles
boger
that's
right.
mr.
john
charles
boger
the
next
study
was
coded
by
law
students
from
the
pardon
and
parole
board
files.
and
it
was
supervised
by
one
of
the
gentleman
who
had
been
involved
in
the
first
study.
mr.
john
charles
boger
that's
correct,
although
let
me
hasten
to
say,
justice
white,
there
was
an
elaborate
set
of
what
are
called
protocols,
there
was
an
elaborate
set
of
rules.
mr.
john
charles
boger
so
that
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
five
law
students
turned
loose
to
make
their
own
judgments.
they
in
fact
were
given
guidance
on
every
one
of
the
variables
about
which
they
had
to
enter
information.
and
undoubtedly
they
then
had
to
apply
those
rules
to
the
transcripts,
to
the
facts
as
they
saw
them.
mr.
john
charles
boger
but
that
was
the
way
in
which
data
was
gathered.
there's
no
suggestion
that
there's
any
serious
amount
of
misinformation
that
was
collected
because
of
the
use
of
these
trained
students.
indeed,
the
state
never
came
forward
with
any
serious
information
that
suggested
that
the
files
themselves
had
been
miscoded
as
matters
into
the
questionnaire.
mr.
john
charles
boger
no,
your
honor,
the
trial
court
locked
at
a
set--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--well,
no.
that's
an
important
question.
i
want
to
address
it.
the
"u"
codes
was
something
with
respect
the
district
court
i
think
misunderstood.
what...
baldus
had
a
set
of
coding
conventions.
mr.
john
charles
boger
no,
what
happened,
your
honor--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--on
the
"u"
codes,
he
simply
noted
that
there
were
a
lot
of
them.
he
then
also
noted
that
he
could
have
coded
"u"
s
when
you
went
to
do
the
analysis
as
present
rather
than
absent.
mr.
john
charles
boger
the
coding
had
been
incorrect.
all
the
experts--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--i
think
it
was
clearly
erroneous.
even
the
state's
experts,
on
that
point,
your
honor,
said
the
coding
should
have
been
the
other
way.
but
it
didn't
matter--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--because
professor
baldus
took
the
suggestion
of
the
district
court,
said,
i'll
go
back
and
recode
these
"u"
s
the
other
way,
and
i'll
show
you
that
when
i
do,
as
he
did,
the
analysis
doesn't
change.
race
stays
important.
all
of
the
minor
coding
questions--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--that
were
raised
in
the
district
court
were
resolved
in
this
way.
professor
baldus
said,
do
you
think
i
should
dealt
with
others
that
weren't
included
in
my
analysis?
i'll
go
back
and
recode
and
reinclude
the
others
that
were
left
out.
and
i'll
show
that
doesn't
make
a
difference.
so
in
other
words,
he
demonstrated
that
the
minor
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
state
at
the
hearing
really
made
no
substantial
difference
at
all.
mr.
john
charles
boger
we
asked
professor
baldus
to
undertake
the
study.
but
then
we
had
no
contact
with
the
data
collection
process
itself.
mr.
john
charles
boger
we
did,
indeed.
we
suggested,
for
example,
that
he
include
certain
items
in
his
questionnaire.
but
having
done
that,
we
left,
of
course,
to
professor
baldus
the
job
of
finding
cut
whether
that
evidence
existed--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--in
the
state
of
georgia.
indeed,
the
arrangement
between
the
legal
defense
fund
and
professor
baldus
was
the
following:
you
undertake
the
studies;
we'll
fund
it
through
some
private
foundation
money
we
have;
whatever
your
results,
you
may
publish
it,
if
the
results--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--he
actually
received
no
salary.
he
received
expenses
for
the
conduct
of
the
study
itself.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well,
there
were
monies
from
a
private
foundation
that
had
been
given
to
us
to
allow
us
to
conduct
such
a
study.
but
it
was
a
hands...
an
arm's
length
relationship
as
far
as
the
integrity
of
the
study
itself
was
concerned,
and
the
state
never
questioned
that.
this
was
brought
out
by
us
at
the
hearing.
and
professor
baldus,
the
district
judge
remarked
throughout
the
hearing,
was
a
man
obviously
of
academic
integrity.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
he
was
trying
to
shape
his
results
to
meet
the
ends
of
litigation.
indeed,
he
warned
us
that
based
on
his
preliminary
guess,
he
didn't
think
there
would
be
any
discrimination
in
georgia;
that
a
prior
study
done
in
california
in
1971
had
suggested
that
there
was
no
discrimination
there,
and
that's
what
he
expected
to
find.
he
worked
against
his
own
hunches,
in
other
words,
as
he
did
this
study.
mr.
john
charles
boger
yes,
i
believe
he
does,
your
honor,
and
yet
i
believe
that
we
have
shown
that
in
this
case.
we've
had
to
show
it
inferentially,
of
course.
juries
in
georgia
deliberate
in
secret,
and
there
are
no
records
kept;
and
prosecutors
rarely
confess
their
own--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--well,
there
are
a
number
of
different
sources
of
that
authority,
your
honor.
both
washington
v.
davis,
of
course,
and
arlington
heights,
say
that
the
courts
must
be
sensitive
to
such
evidence
as
does
exist,
and
acknowledge
that
in
some
cases
the
evidence
of
historical
fact
plus
statistics
may
be
all
that
does
exist.
in
the
jury
discrimination
cases,
for
example,
one
rarely--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--there's
also
evidence
of
discrimination
against
black
defendants
who've
murdered
whites,
especially
in
the
mid-range
of
moderately
aggravated
cases.
in
other
words
the
race
of
defendant
discrimination
exists,
and
baldus
documented
it,
but
it's
not
as
pervasive.
it
really
is
more
of
a
subdivision
of
the
cases
in
georgia.
but
the
race
of
victim
discrimination,
as
your
honor
suggests,
is
statewide,
and
in
all
the
cases.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well,
if
the
question
is
one,
if
you
would,
of
standing,
a
defendant...
if
i
have
two
defendants
at
my
right
hand,
and
two
at
my
left,
and
the
two
at
my
right
have
murdered
whites
in
georgia,
and
two
at
my
left
have
murdered
blacks,
surely
my
defendants
on
the
right
hand
would
have
standing
if
georgia
had
a
statute
that
made
killing
a
white
person
a
mere
serious
crime.
they'd
say
that's
unconstitutional.
that's
an
invidious
discrimination.
if
georgia
is
administering
its
statutes
in
precisely
that
way,
so
that
in
fact
those
who
murder
whites
are
subject
to
more
severe
risk
of
death,
then
i
believe
the
situation
is
identical.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well,
no,
we've
suggest
that
there
are
two
approaches
the
court
can--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--well,
no,
i
don't
think
abolition
is
the
outcome
either.
under
the
eighth
amendment,
as
we've
suggested,
if
the
statute
is
not
operating
evenhandedly,
georgia's
current
statute
need
be
struck.
and
if
it
is,
georgia
can
conceivable
try
to
remedy
its
problems
and
come
back
with--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--not
facially,
your
honor;
they
were
proved
of
course
in
the
gregg
case.
but
they
have
proven
incapable,
in
fact,
of
preventing
this
kind
of
discrimination
which
we've
documented.
and
so
like
furman
we've
reached
a
point
where
the
court,
we
argue,
must
say,
these
procedures,
whatever
they
are,
have
not
worked
in
the
state
of
georgia--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--your
honor,
i
think
we
have
shown
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
this
jury
did.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
suggest
to
you
why
i
believe
we
have
made
that
showing.
we
of
course
don't
have
confessions
from
the
jurors
themselves.
no
one
has
come
forward.
but
indirectly
what
we
have
is
a
pattern
that
professor
baldus
documented--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--no,
this
jury
only
assembles,
as
you
say,
for
one
decision.
of
course,
in
the
bazemore
case,
you
had
a
hundred
county
commissions
that
had
to
make
judgments
about
what
salaries
were
going
to
be
paid.
and
the
county
commissions
were
composed
of
people
who
rotated
on
and
off
because
of
actual
politics.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i
believe
bazemore
assisted,
as
did
the
batson
case,
which
talked
about
simply
having
proof
that
makes
it
more
likely
than
not
that
discrimination
exists.
if
we
could
show,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
six
our
of
ten
of
blacks
who
murdered
whites
are
receiving
death
in
a
racially
discriminatory
fashion,
on
grounds
where
if
there
were
white
defendants,
they
wouldn't
have,
we
would
not
be
able
to
show,
of
course,
which
ones
of
the
six
they
were.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
it's
not
simply
the
jury.
i
was
responding
in
terms
of
your
question.
but
professor
baldus'
evidence
shows
dramatically
that
the
prosecutor
plays
a
serious
role
in
this
process.
mr.
john
charles
boger
not
as
between
charging,
but
as
between
deciding
who
to
plead
out
to
a
lesser
defense
or
permit
not
to
go
to
trial,
and
who
to
move
on
to
penalty.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i
don't
believe
we
have
to
show
that
a
particular
prosecutor,
as
opposed
to
the
prosecutorial
office,
your
honor.
what
we
have
shown
is--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--i
think
we
could
conclude
under
your
fernco
rationale...
you
said
that
we
looked
to
all
of
the
rational
reasons.
we
assume
people
act
rationally.
we
look
to
all
of
the
legitimate
reasons
why
one
would
make
a
decision.
and
if
none
of
the
legitimate
reasons
make
the
distinction
that
seems
to
have
been
made,
then
we
can
infer
that
what
is
at
work
is
an
illegitimate
consideration.
in
this
case,
we've
shown
that
there
have
been
17
defendants
in
fulton
county
who
killed
police
officers,
or
who
were
involved
in
police
officer
killings.
of
those
17,
in
the
1973-79
period,
only
two
even
went
to
a
sentencing
jury;
and
of
those
two,
one
went
before
a
jury
having
killed
a
black
police
officer.
and
he
received
a
life
sentence.
mr.
john
charles
boger
at
least...
let's
see,
out
of
the
7
who
were,
like
mr.
mccleskey,
the
trigger
person
who
were
involved
in
an
armed
robbery,
there
were
three
plea
bargains,
and
four
went
to
trial.
mr.
john
charles
boger
no,
that's
incorrect,
your
honor.
mr.
john
charles
boger
that's
an
erroneous
statement
by
the
court.
in
fact,
i've
got
a
deposition
by
the
prosecutor,
which
was
offered
at
the
state
habeas
proceeding.
his
statement
on
the
record
was
that
there
was
no
plea
discussion.
no
the
defense
counsel
testified
at
that
same
hearing
that
he
urged
mr.
mccleskey
to
consider
asking
for
a
plea
negotiations.
mr.
mccleskey
said,
i
did
not...
i
was
not
the
trigger
man;
i
didn't
commit
the
murder;
i
don't
want
a
plea
bargain.
but
then
we
submitted--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--that's
correct.
but
on
page
15
of
russell
j.
parker's
deposition...
he
was
the
district
attorney...
question,
was
there
a
plea
bargain
in
effect?
answer:
we
never
discussed
a
plea.
so
that
really
was
an
erroneous
statement
by
the
district
court.
but
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
we
can
show
in
effect--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--yes,
mr.
justice
powell.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
charles
boger
the
aggravating
circumstances
were
murder
committed
during
an
armed
robbery,
and
the
slaying
of
a
police
officer
in
the
official
course
of
his
duty.
those
would
be
two--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--well,
they
are
mid-range
in
themselves.
what
the
evidence--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--that's
what
the
evidence
shows,
your
honor.
in
fulton
county,
as
i
indicated,
there
were
17
defendants
who
had
shot
police
officers.
and
7
of
those,
at
least,
had
committed
armed
robberies
or
other
serious
felonies
at
the
same
time.
and
mr.
mccleskey
is
the
only
death
sentence.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well,
we
of
course
contended
below
that
that
was--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--but
yes,
at
this
point
we
are.
mr.
john
charles
boger
that's
correct.
it's
no
doubt,
justice
powell,
that's
a
serious
offense.
mr.
john
charles
boger
there
certainly
appeared
to
have
been
at
least
a
flurry
of
shots
toward
the
officer.
i
don't
believe
it
was
at
close
range,
justice
scalia.
i
think
it
would
depend
i
guess
on
what
we
mean
by
close
range.
but
10
or
12
feet,
i
believe.
it
was
not
an
execution-style
slaying,
in
that
sense.
the
officer
apparently
ran
into
the
front
of
the
furniture
store.
someone
ran,
either
our
client
or
somebody
else;
he
was
shot
in
the
right
eye
from
some
distance,
10
or
12
feet
apparently.
but
there's
no
doubt
that
the
crime
is
a
serious
one.
what
the
evidence
shows,
though,
it's
not
the
kind
of
crime
that
gets
death
in
fulton
county,
or
indeed,
statewide,
on
any
regular
basis.
that's
what's
remarkable.
i
mean,
it
really
is
a
surprise,
i
suspect
to
the
court,
as
it
is
to
counsel
to
find
that
when
you
look,
the
people
who
are
getting
death
are
not
this
kind
of
case.
indeed,
it's
the
torture
murderers
and
the
multiple
killers
in
fulton
county
who
receive
death.
out
of
17
people
who've
killed
police
officers
in
fulton
county,
this
is
the
only
death
sentence
during
the
period
of
time.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i
don't
believe
we
saw
a
pattern
of
evidence
like
that,
but
i
suppose
that
if
one
could
show
that
prosecutors
were
deliberately
seeking
lesser
charges,
that
the
logic
under
the
equal
protection
clause
would
extend
that
far.
of
course,
under
an
eighth
amendment
analysis,
it
wouldn't
necessarily.
mr.
john
charles
boger
that's
correct.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i
don't
think
the
court
has
afforded
the
same
kind
of
protection,
constitutionally,
to
shifty-eyedness
or
those
other
characteristics.
mr.
john
charles
boger
there
is
some
heightened
protection
for
females.
and
yet
professor
baldus'
study
reassures
us
that
there
appears
not
to
be
discrimination
based
on
sex
in
the
state
of
georgia.
there's
no
surprise
to
what
we're
seeing
here.
this
is
not
some
sort
of
statistical
fluke
or
aberration.
we
have
a
century-old
pattern
in
the
state
of
georgia
of
animosity
in
years
long
gone
by,
and
now
still
residual
racial
prejudices
that
justice
white
noted
last
term
in
the
turner
case,
some
of
which
are
not
even
known
to
the
people
involved.
and
therefore
when
we
see
these
interracial
killings,
blacks
who
kill
whites,
and
we
see
prosecutors
disposing
of
these
cases,
and
juries
deciding
on
death
sentences,
particularly
when
we're
asking
the
juries
to
do
that
most
difficult
of
tasks,
which
is
to
judge
who
is
worthy
of
staying
alive,
and
who
is
not,
it
shouldn't
be
any
surprise
to
us
that
some
of
this
kind
of
discrimination
comes
through,
where
it
wouldn't
necessarily
with
sex,
and
certainly
not
with
shifty-eyedness.
mr.
john
charles
boger
no,
it's
not
necessarily
a
tension.
the
court
has,
i
think,
wisely
decided
that
there
should
be
a
large
measure
of
discretion
afforded
to
juries.
but
discretion
cannot
be
exercise
outside
constitutional
grounds.
and
race...
distinctions
based
on
race
are
one
of
the
principal--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--well,
i
think
that's
where
the
court
has
to
draw
a
line.
it
has
to
say
that
if
juries
in
fact
are
imposing
death
sentences
because
of
race,
that
that
discretion
cannot
be
tolerated.
i
though
in
part
that's
what
the
turner--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--not
necessarily.
they
were
based
on
the
hope...
they
were
based
on
the
strong
presumption
which
should
have
been
afforded
the
states
that
they
could
carry
out
those
statutes
without
racial
discrimination.
georgia
has
failed
that
test.
mr.
mccleskey
was
undoubtedly
sentenced
to
death,
in
part,
because
he
committed
a
homicide
and
an
armed
robbery.
but
he
was
also
sentenced
to
death,
in
part,
we
believe,
because
he
was
black.
mr.
john
charles
boger
georgia,
justice
scalia,
has
one
of
the
most
unfettered,
one
of
the
loosest
systems
of
capital
sentencing
that's
come
before
the
court.
they
don't,
as
in
california
or
texas,
have
anything
that
sets
special
circumstances
at
the
guilt
phase
to
narrow
the
range
of
crimes.
they
don't
have
a
list
of
mitigating
circumstances,
the
way
most
statutes
do,
or
any
balancing
at
the
sentencing
phase.
the
court
held
in
zant
v.
stephens,
once
a
single
aggravating
circumstance
has
been
found,
there
is
no
more
constraint
on
a
georgia
jury.
and
as
we
showed
through
the
depositions
of
the
prosecutor,
there
are
no
prosecutorial
standards,
much
less...
statewide,
there
are
none
even
within
fulton
county
to
help
check
the
discretion
of
the
prosecutors,
to
make
sure
that
they're
channeling
their
decisions
in
a
way
that
avoid
this
kind
of
problem.
of
course
it'd
be
a
matter
for
the
georgia
legislature
to
come
up
with
some
solutions
remedially,
but
there
are
a
number
of
solutions
that
are
available
to
it,
i'd
suggest.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
