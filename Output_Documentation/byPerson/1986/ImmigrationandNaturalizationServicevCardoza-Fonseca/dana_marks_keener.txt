ms.

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
understandably,
the
government
is
putting
considerable
emphasis
on
their
deference
argument.
that's
because
it's
the
only
argument
that
it
has.
unfortunately,
there
are
some...
or
fortunately
for
our
side...
there
are
some
considerable
problems
with
deference
to
the
agency
in
this
particular
context.
by
reviewing
the
statutory
canons
that
apply
to
deference,
the
first
place
you
start
is
with
the
fact
that
a
court
is
the
expert
in
terms
of
statutory
construction.
the
meaning
of
the
"well-founded
fear"
standard
is
an
issue
of
law.
it's
clearly
within
the
traditional
function
of
this
court
to
interpret.
it
is
not
an
area--
ms.
dana
marks
keener
--no.
of
course
the
court
also
looks
at
other
factors,
and
deference
cases
talk
about
the
fact,
chevron
for
example,
that
first
always
is
congress'
intent.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
i
think
that
answer
is
probably
correct.
but
in
arriving
at
whether
deference
is
considered
or
not,
the
courts
usually
look
at
several
factors,
which
include
the
legislative
history,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
well,
it
can
be
if
a
standard
is
not
a
question
of
pure
law,
if
it
is
an
application
of
the
law
to
a
specific
set
of
facts.
and
courts
often
look
to
the
agency's
expertise
to
decide
whether
or
not
that's
the
kind
of
situation
presented.
however,
that's
not
the
case
here.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
there
was
a
technical
gap
in
chevron,
and
it
was
involved
in
the
implementation.
so
it
was
construing
a
term
involved
in
implementing
a
standard.
however,
here
the
standard
was
explicitly
set
forth
by
congress
as
a
well-founded
fear
standard.
but
congress
went
even
further.
congress
stated
that
this
term,
well-founded
fear,
is
to
be
construed
consistently
with
the
united
nations
protocol,
with
the
international
understanding
of
the
term.
that's
different
from
deferring
the
interpretation
of
a
standard
to
an
agency
in
the
process
of
administering
its
law.
there
is
no
discretion
in
what
the
substantive
standard
is
for
asylum.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
it
is
unreasonable
here.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
that's
correct.
because
the
standard
was
selected
by
congress,
because
congress
specifically
indicated
the
criteria
it
was
to
be
evaluated
by,
any
interpretation
by
the
agency
which
does
not
carry
out
that
explicit
intent
of
congress
is
therefore
unreasonable.
amicus
in
this
case
from
the
united
nations
high
commissioner
on
refugees
has
stated
explicitly
that
the
government's
interpretation
here
is
not
consistent
with
the
united
nations
protocol.
this
is
also
not
an
area
where
there's
the
special
expertise
of
the
agency,
as
there
are
in
some
deference
cases.
this
is
an
internationally
accepted
standard.
it's
a
standard
that
has
been
in
our
law
in
various
forms,
not
just
since
the
1973
case
that
the
government
is
relying
on,
but
going
back
to
the
1948
displaced
persons
act.
the
main
flaw
in
the
government's
reasoning
here
is
the
fact
that
they
are
not
tracing
the
history
of
the
standard,
okay.
united
states
law
for
30
years
has
had
separate
refugee
admissions
policies
and
separate
standards
and
statutes
which
relate
to
the
deportation
of
refugees.
since
1948,
the
refugee
admission
standards
have
been
based
on
a
good
reason
to
fear
formulation,
and
that
was
derived
from
the
united
nations...
the
grandfather
of
the
united
nations
protocol,
which
is
the
international
refugee
organization
constitution,
starting
with
a
good
reason
to
fear
standard,
a
fear
of
persecution
standard.
that
fear
of
persecution
standard
is
traced
in
our
briefs
and
in
amicus
briefs
to
the
predecessor
provision
to
the
current
provision
today
of
the
1965
act.
and
in
the
1965
act,
a
provision
under
section
203(a)(7),
conditional
entry,
was
admitted
by
this
court
in
stevic
to
be
the
predecessor
provision
to
the
asylum
provision
which
was
now
codified,
and
also
to
be
a
standard
available
under
good
reason
to
fear.
the
agency
itself
has
recognized
that
good
reason
to
fear
is
a
more
lenient
and
more
generous
standard
than
the
standard
under
withholding
of
deportations.
so
far
from
being
consistent,
the
government
now
is
taking
a
position
which
is
inconsistent
with
that
long
historical
development.
it
evidences
a
confusion
on
the
part
of
the
agency,
rather
than
consistency.
congress
when
it
codified
the
refugee
act
of
1980
specifically
stated
that
its
purpose
was
to
revise
and
to
regularize
refugee
admissions.
in
doing
that,
it
pointed
out
the
kinds
of
relief
that
it
was
replacing.
that
was
section
203(a)(7),
the
good
reason
to
fear
admissions,
the
attorney
general's
general
parole
obligations,
and
also
it
did
mention
the
regulatory
asylum
standards.
however,
in
his
introduction
on
the
senate
floor
the
sponsor
of
the
bill,
senatory
kennedy,
explicitly
said
present
regulations
and
provisions
do
not,
simply
do
not
conform
with
the
spirit
or
the
provisions
of
the
united
nations
protocol.
that
is
clear.
that
is
clear
legislative
intent.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
i
do
not.
i
felt
my
colleague
stated
my
position
very
well,
in
essence,
as
he
hypothesized
how
we
would
answer,
that
discretion
has
to
be
exercised
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
and
any
time
that
the
attorney
general
would
promulgate
a
blanket
rule
in
this
kind
of
this
case
would
most
likely
violate
that
case
by
case
determination
or
exercise
of
discretion,
and
it
would
violate
the
clear
intent
of
congress.
the
standard,
again,
was
not
delegated.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
most
likely
that
would
be
inconsistent.
there
are
guidelines--
ms.
dana
marks
keener
--with
a
case
by
case
determination.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
it's
inherent
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
that
every
case
be
evaluate
on
its
individual
facts.
and
to
the
extent
that
that
individual
determination
has
been
omitted--
ms.
dana
marks
keener
--this
court
will
set
the
rule
in
this
case.
that
will
be
the
rule
which
applies.
and
as
is
traditional
with
any
judicial
standard,
further
cases
will
enrich
and
develop
what
that
standard
actually
means.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
i
don't
see
a
problem
with
the
policy
decision,
as
long
as
individual
cases
are
then
reviewed
to
see
that
they
fall
correctly
within
that
policy.
that
would
be
appropriate.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
the
state
department
now
participates
in
evaluation
of
country
conditions,
which
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
the
asylum
determination.
the
government
is
very
involved
in
helping
find
whether
someone's
fear
of
return
to
a
particular
locale
is
in
fact
an
objective
fear.
and
of
course,
there
could
be
policies
developed
that
assist
the
tryer
of
fact
in
evaluating
that
case.
from
that
perspective,
it
would
be
completely
appropriate.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
that's
what
i
think
would
be
inappropriate.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
that's
not
irrational.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
i
didn't
mean
to
be
saying
that.
if
that
is
what
i
was
saying,
then
it's
not
correct.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
attorney
general
cannot
on
a
blanket
situation
say...
he
can
say
everyone
from
afghanistan
has
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution.
i
think
he
would
be
abdicating
his
exercise
of
discretion
to
say
everyone
from
afghanistan
will
either
be
granted
asylum
or,
maybe
he'd
say,
will
be
denied
asylum
in
the
exercise
of
discretion.
but
that's
a
factor
to
be
analyzed
on
an
individual
case,
as
to
whether
there
is
a
valid
basis
for
the
exercise
of
that
discretion.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
i
believe
that
would
fly
in
the
face
of
congress'
clear
intent.
i
believe
it
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
accepted
international
definitions,
which
go
into
great
detail
as
to
the
individual
factors
of
the
particular
case
that
must
be
developed.
and
in
fact,
that's
not
what
the
attorney
general
does.
i
don't
expect
that--
ms.
dana
marks
keener
--it
is
discretionary,
however.
the
attorney
general
can
promulgate
guidelines
that
help
him
decide
whether
or
not
someone
has
a
well-founded
fear.
but
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
some
kind
of
case
by
case
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
an
individual
case
has
its
merits,
or
otherwise
a
case
is
not
being
considered
on
its
merits.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
well,
that's
within
the
agency's
expertise.
and
i
suppose
to
the
extent
that
regulations
are
consistent
with
its
expertise
of
saying,
look
at
factor
a,
look
at
factor
b,
look
at
factor
c,
that
would
be
appropriate.
we're
not
trying
to
tell
the
immigration
service
how
to
administer
their
law.
but
we
are
saying
that
congress
was
clear
as
to
what
that
law
is
and
what
that
standard
is.
and
beyond
that,
i
suppose
that's
an
issue
for
another
case.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
what
the
attorney
general
is
doing--
ms.
dana
marks
keener
--because...
and
it
was
pointed
out
in
stevic
quite
clearly...
by
meeting
the
definition
of
refugee,
someone
who
has
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution,
that
does
not
automatically
require
a
grant
of
asylum.
that's
in
the
congressional
history
as
well.
that's
what
discretion
means,
that
although
the
statutory
formulation
is
met,
it
is
not
required.
it's
up
to
the
attorney...
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
attorney
general
can
then
have
a
wooden
formulation
of
who's
going
to
qualify
and
who
is
not,
because
that
violates
the
intent
of
congress.
the
history
of
this
provision
shows
that
the
congress
was
very
concerned
with
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
executive.
there
is
a
very
thorough
law
review
article,
anker
and
posner,
that
goes
back
on
the
history
of
various
bills
which
were
introduced
into
congress
which
show
that
was
precisely
what
congress
was
attempting
to
circumscribe,
the
unfettered
discretion
and
the
lack
of
uniformity
of
refugee
admissions.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
that
seemed
to
be
what
justice
scalia
was
interested
in.
i
feel
uncomfortable
in
the
sense
of
i
don't
think
that's
an
issue
raised
by
this
case
as
well.
i
feel
the
issue
today
is
what
the
standard
is
and
did
congress
choose
a
standard.
and
if
congress
indicated
a
standard,
how
is
it
to
be
interpreted.
congress
specifically...
the
government
indicates
in
their
brief
also
that
congress
said
the
standard
was
to
conform
with
the
united
nations
protocol.
we
agree
on
that.
whether
the
government's
interpretation
conforms
or
not
is
the
essence
of
our
dispute
here,
okay.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
the
answer
to
that
i
believe
is
found
also
in
stevic,
that
because
refugee
admissions
were
not
required
our
accession
to
the
protocol
back
in
1967
did
not
affect
our
refugee
admissions
procedures.
the
fatal
flaw
in
the
government's
argument
that
regulatory
asylum
should
be
adopted
as
the
standard
also
goes
back.
there
was
no
standard
for
regulatory
asylum
in
1965.
in
1965,
what
congress
was
talking
about
at
that
time,
at
the
time
of
our
accession,
was
the
good
reason
to
fear
standard
in
the
predecessory
section
of
203(a)(7),
which
is
what
we
have
been
saying
over
and
over
and
over.
that's
what
the
legislative
history
shows,
and
the
government
has
never
come
up
with
an
answer
as
to
why
the
specific
standard
for
regulatory
asylum
which
they
finally
set
forth
in
the
1979
regulations,
that
standard
was
expressly
rejected
by
congress
in
its
actions.
and
the
government
has
never
come
up
for
a
justification
how
to
avoid
congress'
clear
intent.
in
interpreting
legislative
history,
again,
it's
a
canon
of
construction
that
the
court
does
not
lightly
disregard
what
congress
has
considered
and
explicitly
refused
to
do.
the
government,
yes,
they
proposed
a
formulation
of
the
bill
and
that
formulation,
which
would
have
said
in
essence
that
if
someone
qualifies
for,
show
a
clear
probability
of
persecution,
then
they
are
eligible
for
asylum.
congress
took
that
cut.
congress
said
if
someone
is
a
refugee.
and
the
other
major
flaw
in
the
government's
argument,
that
they
have
never
responded
to
in
their
briefs
or
in
their
argument
today,
is
about
the
fact
that
there's
another
asylum
provision,
another
refugee
admissions
provision
that
they
are
failing
to
discuss.
and
that's
section
207.
section
208,
which
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
and
section
207
both
go
back
to
a
definitional
section
in
101(a)(42).
that
is
where
"refugee"
is
defined.
that
is
where
the
well-founded
fear
language
comes
from.
it
does
not
apply,
as
this
court
pointed
cut
in
its
textual
analysis
in
stevic.
that
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
does
not
apply
to
the
withholding
of
deportation
provisions.
it
does
not
mention
it,
it
is
not
referred
to,
nor
is
the
language
comparable.
and
the
government
has
never
explained
how
it's
going
to
apply
two
different
statements
to
refugees.
that
is
far
more
anomalous
and
far
more
unworkable
than
what
we
are
proposing
to
do
here
today.
the
government
is
going
to
treat
refugees
who
are
currently
in
afghanistan
differently
from
those
who
are
at
the
united
states
borders.
and
that
again
was
explicitly
discussed
in
the
legislative
history.
it
was
that
lack
of
uniformity
of
procedures
that
congress
was
hoping
to
address,
was
planning
to
address,
and
specifically
did
address.
and
that's
what
the
government
seeks
to
ignore.
another
major
flaw
in
the
deference
argument
is
the
fact
that
the
agency's
interpretation
which
it
relies
so
heavily
on,
the
decision
in
dunar,
is
sheer
dicta.
dunar
was
a
case
very
much
like
stevic,
which
simply
held
that
accession
to
the
united
states...
united
nations
protocol
did
not
alter
the
standard
under
section
243(h),
and
any
further
discussion
was
dicta,
and
i
think
that's
an
important
factor
to
remember.
ms.

want

comments

characterized
that
way.

a
case
by
case

can.
ms.
dana

yes,
he
can.
and
that's
not
so
illogical,
to
have
a
broad
group
be
available
for
review
by
the
attorney
general's
discretion,
then
individual
factors
of
how
many
other
refugees
came
in
in
this
particular
year,
what
is
the
economic
situation
in
the
united

at
that
time.
perhaps
all
those
factors
would
be
relevant
and
should
be
considered
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
an
individual
case.
ms.

a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
is
really
quite
simply
a
reasonable

factual
situation
fear

of
the
small

is
going
to
happen.
ms.
dana

the
answer
is
that
the
tryer
of
fact
should
look
at
the
specific
facts
which
you
put

the
objective
situation.

the
way
to
determine
whether
or

somebody
qualifies
for
the
well-founded
fear
standard...
you're
not
alone
without
support
as
to
how
to
make
that
decision.
there's
a
united
nations
handbookk
which
is
the
compilation
of

years
of
experience
of
various
factors.
and
in
fact,
in
a
letter
from
the
assistant
attorney
general
olson
to
the
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
service
which
is
part
of
the
record
of
the
1981
house
judiciary
committee
oversight
hearings,
it
was
specifically
said
that
that's
an
appropriate
aid
to
construction.
we
assume
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
criteria
articulated
in
the
handbook.
that
united
nations
handbook
is
of
course
an
invaluable
aid
to
construction.
but
the
courts
have
already
used
the
handbook
and
applied
it.
there
are
several
cases--
ms.
dana
marks
keener
--that's
what
the
assistant
attorney
general
said.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
yes,
that
was
a
quote.
that
was
a
quote
from...
and
i
will
mention
that
citation
again...
the
assistant
attorney
general
olson,
in
a
letter
to
general
counsel
krauchlin,
which
was
part
of
the
additions
to
the
1981
house
judiciary
committee
oversight
hearings.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
i
don't
know
the
basis
for
his
remarks,
i
am
sorry.
the
point
is,
the
court
has
applied
the
standard
and
it
has
not
found
it
to
be
a
difficult
to
apply
standard.
the
courts
have
come
out
and
said
mere
assertions
of
a
possible
fear
are
not
enough;
a
genuine
fear
of
widespread
violence,
of
civil
strife,
that's
not
enough.
what
the
courts
have
said
is
a
specific
factual
proof
of
an
objective
situation
which
demonstrates
that
persecution
is
a
reasonable
possibility.
i
would
submit
if
the
chances
of
persecution
are
one
in
a
thousand
it's
not
a
reasonable
possibility
that
you
would
be
persecuted.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
the
focus
on
probability
takes
out
of
consideration
the
focus
on
subjective
feelings
and
beliefs
which
is
a
critical
element
in
the
refugee
status
definition
because
of
the
fact
that
it
recognizes
the
everyday
realities
of
refugees
proving
their
cases.
these
aren't
tort
cases.
these
aren't
cases
between
two
huge
companies
deciding
who's
going
to
be
liable
or
who
should
foot
the
bill.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
exactly.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
because
likelihood
implies
probability,
and
in
fact
in
the
history
of
the
immigration
act
realistic
likelihood
has
teen
a
synonym
for
clear
probability
or
more
likely
than
not.
it
does
not...
has
never
been
associated
with
the
good
reason
to
fear
standard.
and
that
good
reason
to
fear
standard,
as
i
mentioned
before,
has
been
applied
successfully
by
the
attorney
general
through
his
delegates
since
1948.
it's
not
a
difficult
standard
to
apply.
it
implies
a
lesser
degree
of
certainty,
and
a
judge
can
figure
cut
what
that
means.
again,
the
individual
facts
of
on
individual
case,
based
on
who
the
applicant
is,
based
on
where
he's
going
to
be
returned
to,
based
on
all
kinds
of
factors,
of
course
come
into
play
and
certainly
would
influence
a
decision.
ms.
dana
marks
keener
i
would
say
that
most
judges
would
assume
that
my
fear--
ms.
dana
marks
keener
--is
not
a
reasoned...
it's
not
a
reasonable
possibility
that
i
will
be
one
in
a
thousand.
that's
my
fear.
if
a
judge
feels
that
that's
reasonable
or
a
tryer
of
fact,
that's
also...
that's
his
decision
to
make.
but
there
are
aids
to
construction.
there
is
an
established
history
of
applying
this
term.
and
it
simply
is
the
agency's
recalcitrance
in
recognizing
that
congress
wanted
a
different
standard,
and
there
seems
that
there
is
no
basis
to
honor
their
interpretation
which
so
clearly
flies
in
the
face
of
unequivocal
congressional
intent.
thank
you.
