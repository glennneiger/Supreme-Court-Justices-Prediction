justice
scalia
mr.
wallace,
i
have
a
question
that's
along
the
same
lines.
what
is
the
extent
of
the
agency's
discretion
here?
suppose
we
were
to
hold
that
there
is
indeed
a
difference
between
well-founded
fear
and
substantial
probability?
would
it
be
within
the
powers
of
the
attorney
general
to
issue
a
regulation
simply
saying
that,
yes,
i
have
authority
to
grant
asylum
to
everyone
where
there's
a
well-founded
fear,
but
as
a
matter
of
discretion
i
am
only
going
to
grant
it
where
there
is
a
substantial
probability?
justice
scalia
by
these
respondents,
do
you
think?
do
you
interpret
the
respondents'
as,
when
they
say
that
this
is
just
a
discretionary
call,
does
their
interpretation
of
discretion
go
that
far?
justice
scalia
so
you
also
have
retained
a
hole
card,
mr.
wallace,
because
ultimately
you're
arguing
you
have
discretion
in
interpreting
the
statute,
so
that
in
the
future
your
client
might
exercise
that
discretion
to
interpret
the
statute
differently
if
he
wants
to,
i
presume.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
mr.
wallace.
i
just
didn't
understand
that
argument.
wouldn't
the
same
thing
have
been
doable
under
the
regime
that
respondents
argue
for?
why
couldn't
he
have
done
the
same
thing?
justice
scalia
what
was
chevron?
wasn't
that
a
question
of
pure
law?
and
didn't
we
say
there
that
we,
and
in
other
cases,
that
we
will
accept
the
expert
agency's
interpretation
of
its
governing
statute
where
it's
a
reasonable
one?
justice
scalia
what
you're
arguing,
if
i
understand
you,
is
that
the
agency's
interpretation
is
not
a
reasonable
one.
justice
scalia
all
right.
but
that's
different
from
saying
we
won't
give
any
deference.
we
give
deference
to
the
agency.
if
it's
interpretation
is
reasonable,
we'll
accept
it,
even
though
there
are
other
reasonable
ones.
you're
saying
this
one
is
not
a
reasonable
one.
justice
scalia
would
that
discretion,
whether
you
say
it
can
be
exercised
generically
or
must
be
exercised
case
by
case,
either
way,
would
that
include
the
discretion
to
say,
even
though
this
individual
or
this
category
of
individuals
have
good
reason
to
fear
within
the
minimal
meaning
of
the
statute,
i'm
still
not
going
to
give
them
asylum?
justice
scalia
your
response
to
that
argument,
your
principal
response
in
your
brief,
is
no,
it's
not
irrational
because
the
standard
for
purposes
of
asylum
is
a
discretionary
one.
it
just
establishes
the
threshold
and
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
to
use
it.
but
now
you're
telling
us
he
does
indeed
have
to
use
it,
unless
he
has
some
very
special
factor.
you're
saying
he
can't
say,
even
though
you
have
good
reason
to
fear,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
asylum.
that's
your
position:
he
must
give
asylum
if
there
is
good
reason
to
fear.
i
don't
consider
that
discretionary.
justice
scalia
well,
but
you're
still
saying
that
he
cannot
say,
even
though
this
category
of
people
have
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution,
i
am
not
going
to
grant
them
asylum.
justice
scalia
that's
fine,
that
may
well
be
true.
but
then
it
isn't
discretionary
in
any
significant
sense.
justice
scalia
but
the
substantial
probability
standard
is
discretionary
in
that
sense.
justice
scalia
it's
no
more
discretionary
than
the
substantial
probability
standard.
there
also
he
has
to
decide
case
by
case
whether
there
is
a
substantial
probability
or
not.
so
how
is
this
determination
any
more
discretionary
than
the
deportation
determination?
justice
scalia
ms.
keener,
i
wonder
of
you
would
address
one
argument
of
the
government
that
troubles
me
some,
which
is
that
if
this
is
a
different
standard
from
more
likely
than
not,
what
does
it
consist
of?
how
can
you...
if
it
is
a
different
standard
and
if
there
is
as
little
discretion
as
you
have
described
in
the
attorney
general's
application
of
it...
that
is,
he
can't
say,
even
though
you
meet
it
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
in,
or
he
can't
say--
justice
scalia
--he
can
say,
even
though
you
have
demonstrated
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution,
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
in?
justice
scalia
all
right.
tell
me
what
it
is
if
it
isn't
more
likely
than
not?
what
is
a
well
founded
fear?
justice
scalia
well
now--
justice
scalia
--let's
assume
that
the
persecution
in
the
country
you're
talking
about
is
very...
it's
horrible
persecution,
it's
torture;
it
isn't
just
incarceration.
now,
suppose
my
chances
of
actually
being
subjected
to
that
if
i
go
back
are
one
in
a
thousand.
would
i
have
a
well-founded
fear
of
going
back?
justice
scalia
i
know
it
would,
and
what's
the
answer?
justice
scalia
you
see,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
is
that
a
well-founded
fear
or
not?
justice
scalia
i
can
tell
more
likely
than
not.
that's
a
standard
i
can
apply,
more
likely
than
not.
but
if
you
just
tell
me
well-founded
fear,
am
i
to
put
my
risk
aversion?
you
know,
maybe
i
can
handle
torture,
so
one
in
a
hundred
i'd
go.
justice
scalia
you
sure
you
wouldn't
have
a
well-founded
fear
if
the
regime
in
question
has
systematically
said,
every
tuesday
we
are
selecting
one
out
of
1,000
people
and
shooting
them,
and
that's
the
regime
that
i'm
going
to
deport
you
back
to?
justice
scalia
is
not
well-founded?
