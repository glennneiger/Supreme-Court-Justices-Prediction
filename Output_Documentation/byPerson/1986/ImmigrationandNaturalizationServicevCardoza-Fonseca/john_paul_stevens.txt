justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
moment.
although
it's
true,
of
course,
that
asylum
is
a
broader
right
than
just
the
withholding
of
deportation
to
a
particular
country,
is
it
not...
isn't
also
the
converse
true,
that
under
208(a)
surviving
the
threshold
to
establish
eligibility
does
not
establish
a
right
to
asylum,
but
merely
a
right
to
have
the
attorney
general
exercise
his
discretion
and
decide
whether
or
not
to
grant
asylum?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
true
that
if
your
opponent's
construction
of
the
statute
were
taken
as
correct,
that
there
then
could
be
an
opportunity
for
the
attorney
general
to
decide
exactly
what
standard
should
govern
that
newly--
justice
stevens
--well,
do
you
think,
if
congress
intended
that
there
be
two
different
standards,
it
would
have
been
within
the
board's
discretion
to
say,
well,
we'll
just
adopt
the
same
standard
for
both?
do
you
think
that
kind
of
discretion
is
appropriate
for
an
expert
agency?
justice
stevens
do
they
have
any
more
expertise
on
a
question
like
that
than
a
court
does?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
mean
expertise
on
what
congress
meant,
not
expertise
on
handling
claims.
it
surely
has
that,
of
course.
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
if
your
first
answer
to
justice
scalia
is
correct,
then
the
attorney
general
would
have
the
power
under
the
statute
to
adopt
a
regulation
substantially
adopting
the
standard,
perhaps
saying
except
in
very
exceptional
cases
on
a
particularized
showing
or
something
like
that,
you
must
meet
the
same
standard.
what
you're
basically
arguing
for
here
is
to
give
your
client
less
discretion
than
your
opponent
thinks
he
should
have.
so
it's
in
kind
of
a
strange
position.
justice
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
if
they
had
satisfied
the
higher
standard
of
proof
and
found
to
have
a
statutory
right
not
to
be
deported
back
to
afghanistan,
you
still
could
have,
under
either
approach,
you
could
have
exercised
discretion
and
said,
we'll
ask
them
to
go
to
pakistan
instead?
justice
stevens
well,
and
if
the
attorney
general
exercises
discretion
not
to
do
so.
justice
stevens
ms.
keener,
let
me
interrupt
you
if
i
may.
why
couldn't
the
attorney
general,
for
example,
determine
that
in
cases
of
refugees
from
afghanistan,
that
if
he
sends
them
back
to
pakistan
they
will
not
be
persecuted
because
they're
safe
there,
and
adopt
a
policy
on
a
country
by
country
basis
of
one
rule
for
one,
one
for
another?
why
would
that
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
to
take
big
categories
of
cases
and
treat
them
in
similar
ways?
i
don't
see
why.
i
don't
understand
your
argument
that
every
case
has
to
start
from
scratch.
discretion
certainly,
as
the
chief
justice
suggests,
has
got
to
work
within
certain--
justice
stevens
--so
he
could
adopt
regulations
that
would
establish
broad
categories
as
a
way
to
treat
these
cases,
perhaps
a
different
statement
of
proof
on
some?
justice
stevens
why?
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
your
argument
that...
the
government's
big
argument
here
is
that
it
does
seem
irrational
to
provide
a
lower
standard
for
the
greater
benefit
of
asylum
than
you
provide
for
the
lesser
benefit
of
avoiding
deportation.
justice
stevens
ms.
keener,
i
think
you're
arguing
the
next
case
rather
than
this
case.
i'm
not
sure
you're
very
wise
in
doing
so.
justice
stevens
what
do
you
do
with
their
argument
that
there's
a
lot
of
material
in
the
legislative
history
that
says
that
conforming
with
the
protocol
really
would
not
change
the
law?
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
before
you
start,
i
just
want
to
give
you
a
question
to
be
sure
you
get
time
to
answer
it.
i
want
you
to
tell
us
your
position
with
regard
to
her
argument
based
on
section
207,
the
processing
of
aliens
abroad.
justice
stevens
you
agree
that
the
word
"refugee"
of
course
applies
to
both?
justice
stevens
and
what
do
you
say
to
her
argument
that
207
was
derived
from
203(a)(7),
in
which
there
was
a--
justice
stevens
--good
reason,
good
reason
to
fear.
justice
stevens
so
your
view
is
203(a)(7)
had
the
same
standard
that
you
maintain
is
appropriate
here?
justice
stevens
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
are
you
saying
that's
the
same
standard
which
you
maintain
now
or
it's
a
different
standard?
justice
stevens
different.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand,
because
it's
going
a
little
fast
for
me.
208
you
agree
today
has
the
same
standard
as
207?
justice
stevens
and
you
also
say
that
the
207
standard
is
the
same
as
the
old
203--
justice
stevens
--so
that
207
adopted
a
different
standard
than
prevailed
previously
with
respect
to
refugees
processed
abroad.
