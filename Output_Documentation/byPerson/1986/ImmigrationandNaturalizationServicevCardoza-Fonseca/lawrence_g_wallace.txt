mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
june
of
1984
this
court
held
in
ins
against
stevic
that
an
alien's
burden
of
proving
eligibility
for
withholding
of
deportation
to
a
particular
country
under
section
243(h)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
is
to
show
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
alien
would
be
subject
to
persecution
if
sent
back
to
that
country.
in
the
present
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
recognized
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
essentially
the
same
standard,
although
formulated
in
various
ways,
also
applies
to
an
alien's
burden
of
proving
eligibility
for
the
greater
benefit
of
asylum
under
section
208(a)
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
rejected
the
board's
interpretation
and
remanded
the
case
for
reconsideration
by
the
board
under
a
standard
devised
by
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
in
circuits
about
whether
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
a
permissible
one,
entitled
to
be
upheld
by
the
courts.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
whose
interpretations
are
binding
by
regulation
on
district
directors
and
other
immigration
and
naturalization
service
employees,
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
the
expert
body
whose
interpretations
of
the
immigration
laws
are
entitled
to
judicial
deference.
and
after
this
court's
opinion
in
stevic
and
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
developed,
the
board
re-examined
at
some
length
its
position
with
respect
to
section
208(a)
in
an
opinion
which
we
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
called
acosta,
beginning
on
page
29a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
taking
up
the
remainder
of
the
appendix.
and
i
commend
that
opinion
to
the
court's
attention.
there
the
board
carefully
considered
the
legislative
history
of
the
refugee
act
of
1980,
its
international
law
background,
the
judicial
opinions
that
have
commented
on
it,
and,
as
the
court
knows,
the
board
determined
that
its
position
had
been
correct
all
along,
and
it
had
good
reasons
for
doing
so.
the
question
is
whether
the
board's
interpretation
is
a
reasonable
one
that
should
be
upheld,
reasonable
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
precluded
by
the
statutory
language
or
by
the
legislative
history
or
by
the
sense
of
the
statute.
and
we
submit
that
there
are
three
categories
of
reasons
why
the
board's
interpretation
is
a
reasonable
one,
entitled
to
judicial
deference.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
assumed
for
purposes
of
decision,
but
it
expressly
left
the
question
open.
you
know,
there
is
some
commentary
which
suggests
the
possibility
that
the
standards
could
be
different,
and
the
assumption
was
made
for
purposes
of
decision.
but
this
is
the
question
that
was
expressly
left
open
in
stevic.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
it
can
be
considered,
but
there
were
no
circumstances
connected
with
that
particular
incident
that
indicated
that
congress
clearly
thought
a
different
standard
did
apply.
and
it's
just
part
of
the
legislative
background
which
the
board
has
considered
as
a
whole.
i
don't
think
there's
any
one
incident
that's
dispositive.
if
i
can--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
still
the
board's
position.
that
has
always
been
the
board's
position,
that
a
clear
probability
or
likelihood
or
what
this
court
called
in
stevic
more
likely
than
not,
three
formulations
which
the
court
recognized
as
equivalent
in
stevic,
are
for
practical
purposes
the
same
as
well-founded
fear
of
prosecution;
that
while
the
verbal
formulations
differ,
as
the
board
put
it,
for
practical
purposes
the
standards
converged.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position.
that
has
consistently
been
the
board's
position.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
that
has
consistently
been
the
board's
position
and
correctly
cited
board
decisions
starting
in
1973
up
through
the
acosta
case
in
which
the
board
has
stated
that
position.
that
is
the
board's
position.
as
we
see
it,
there
are
three
categories
of
reasons
why
the
board's
position
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
first
category
is
that
the
board's
position
takes
a
coherent
view
of
these
interrelated
provisions
of
the
statute,
so
that
they
make
sense
considered
as
a
whole.
it
must
be
remembered
that
asylum
provides
greater
benefits
in
two
important
respects
than
does
what
was
before
the
court
in
stevic,
the
right
to
withholding
of
deportation
to
a
particular
country
upon
a
proper
showing.
in
one
respect
asylum
is
broader
because
it
grants
a
right
not
to
be
deported
anywhere.
somebody
who
shows
that
he's
entitled
to
withholding
of
deportation
under
section
243(h)
is
only
granted
the
right
not
to
be
sent
back
to
that
particular
country.
he
may
still
be
deported
to
some
other
country
if
there's
another
country
willing
to
accept
him,
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
happening
with
some
frequency
currently.
there
are
a
number
of
persons
who
have
been
refugees
from
afghanistan
coming
into
our
country--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
entirely
correct,
and
the
court
pointed
that
out
in
stevic.
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
this
is
a
highly
structured
exercise
of
discretion.
it
is
not
an
ad
hoc
determination
about
individuals
by
the
attorney
general.
in
practice,
this
is
an
exercise
of
discretion
dealing
with
more
than
10,000
asylum
claims
per
year,
an
exercise
of
discretion
which
is
made
by
the
33
district
directors
and
by
the
60
immigration
judges
whose
decisions
are
reviewable
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
and
the
discretion
is
exercised
in
accordance
with
legal
standards
that
are
set
forth
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations
and
that
have
been
developed
in
board
of
immigration
appeals
decisions.
so
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
certainly
could,
mr.
justice,
and
there
is
a
plausible
argument
to
be
made
that
a
coherent
way
of
looking
at
the
statute
would
be
to
rely
on
that
distinction.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
board's
interpretation
is
not
also
a
plausible,
reasonable,
coherent
way
of
reconciling
the
provisions.
and
the
burden
in
attacking
the
board's
interpretation
is
to
show
that
the
board's
interpretation
is
the
one
that's
precluded.
we
do
not
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
that
interpretation
is
precluded.
i
concede
that
it
is
not
precluded,
that
perhaps
the
board
could
have
adopted
it.
but
that
is
not
the
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
what
the
board
has
determined
is
whether
congress
intended
two
different
standards,
a
question
that
is
subject
to
considerable
debate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
board
does
have
expertise
on
this,
because
over
a
period
of
years
it
has
dealt
with
thousands
of
claims
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
has
expertise
because
the
department
of
justice
was
an
active
participant
in
the
legislation
as
it
developed.
it
has
had
the
occasion
to
study
the
legislative
background
against
the
experience
that
it
has
had
in
applying
the
standards.
it
is
closely
familiar
with
what
the
administrative
and
judicial
interpretations
were
that
congress
was
acting
against
the
background
of.
and
it
is
the
sort
of
question
that
expert
agencies
traditionally
are
recognized
to
have
expertise
about.
i
mean,
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
interpreting
the
national
labor
relations
act
constantly,
and
this
court
has
deferred
to
its
expert
judgment
about
the
meaning
of
the
act,
which
gains
content
through
experience
in
its
administration.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
certainly
would
argue
that
that
would
be
within
the
attorney
general's
authority.
he
has
discretion
under
section
208(a).
i'm
sure
an
attack
would
be
made
on
the
validity
of
a
regulation
because--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i'll
have
to
let
them
speak
for
themselves
on
that.
i'm
sure
the
argument
could
be
made
that
once
the
court
determined
that
congress
intended
two
different
standards
to
apply,
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
attorney
general
to
in
effect
repeal
that
difference
by
regulation.
we
could
argue
that
his
discretion
under
section
208(a)
should
be
interpreted
that
broadly.
but
of
course,
it
could
be
a
more
awkward
way
for
the
law
to
be
administered,
even
if
such
a
regulation
were
upheld,
because
then
we
would
be
in
a
position
of
deporting
people
to
countries
where
they
have
shown
that
they
meet
the
statutory
standard
of
showing
a
sufficient
probability
that
they
would
be
persecuted
in
that
country,
and
nonetheless
we
would
be
deporting
them.
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
law
requires
the
attorney
general
to
make
that
call.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
recognize
that.
but
there
are
virtues
in
this
field
of
delicate
international
relations
and
international
obligations
to
having
the
attorney
general
being
able
to
point
to
someone's
failure
to
meet
the
statutory
showing
that
is
required
in
order
to
qualify
for
asylum
status
on
the
basis
of
fear
of
persecution.
and
we
don't
invariably
argue
for
broader
discretion
than
we
think
the
law
confers
on
us.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
that
possibility.
once
the
court
has
upheld
the
present
interpretation,
there's
a
reduced
likelihood
that
that
interpretation
would
be
changed
in
the
absence
of
a
change
by
the
congress.
well,
let
me--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
course.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
other
major
difference
between
asylum
and
deportation.
within
one
year
after
asylum
has
been
granted,
the
alien
is
eligible
to
achieve
legal
permanent
residency,
which
in
turn
then
can
lead
to
citizenship.
and
the
answer
for
practical
purposes
is
yes.
whereas
someone
granted
withholding
of
deportation
is
left
standing
in
the
same
line
he
was
standing
in
prior
to
that,
waiting
to
come
in
under
a
quota.
he
doesn't
in
any
way
advance
toward
achieving
permanent
legal
residency.
those
are
the
main
differences,
and
they
are
the
key
to
the
coherence
of
the
board's
position
here,
that
aliens
facing
a
lower
probability
of
persecution
than
is
required
for
withholding
of
deportation
should
not
obtain
the
greater
relief
available
to
asylees
while
being
ineligible
for
the
lesser
relief.
rather,
the
greater
relief
is
available
within
the
attorney
general's
discretion
to
a
reduced
category
of
those
who
qualify
for
the
lesser
relief.
as
i
began
to
tell
the
court,
that
has
recently
been
done
with
respect
to
refugees
from
afghanistan
who
have
entered
this
country
from
pakistan
on
the
basis
of
forged
entry
documents.
because
of
the
way
they
gained
admittance
to
the
country,
the
attorney
general
through
the
board
has
refused
to
grant
them
asylum,
and
these
days
a
case
like
stevic
is
a
great
rarity.
everyone
asks
for
withholding
of
deportation
or
asylum,
rather
than
just
the
withholding.
the
attorney
general
has
refused
to
grant
them
asylum,
but
because
this
was
not
a
serious
crime
he
has
granted
them
withholding
of
deportation
to
afghanistan
and
the
great
majority
of
them
have
subsequently
been
deported
back
to
pakistan,
where
this
is
something
worked
out
through
international
negotiations
with
pakistan.
it
depends
on
pakistan's
willingness
to
take
them
back.
they
have
been
willing
to
take
back
some
90
percent
of
them.
so
that
is
a
very
meaningful
difference
between
the
two
standards,
which
adds
coherence
to
the
board's
position.
now,
the
second
category--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
just
an
example
of
the
difference.
of
course
the
same
thing
could
have
been
doable
with
respect
to
the
particular
persons,
but
the
point
that
i'm
making,
the
coherence
in
the
board's
position,
is
that
those
who
do
not
even
qualify
for
withholding
of
deportation
should
not
be
granted
the
greater
benefit
of
asylum.
in
some
instances
you
might
have...
if
you
had
the
thing
the
other
way
around,
you
might
have
persons
who
would
not
qualify
for
the
withholding
of
deportation.
and
the
whole
question
would
be
whether
they
would
be
granted
asylum
or
deported.
perhaps
in
the
circumstances
we
might
choose
to
deport
them
to
pakistan
as
well,
if
pakistan
would
take
them.
but
in
the
case
of
the
ten
percent
that
pakistan
wouldn't
take,
they
would
be
deported
back
to
afghanistan.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right,
the
discretion
could
be
exercised.
it's
just
an
example
of
the
difference
in
the
benefit.
if
somebody
qualifies
for
asylum,
however,
if
there's
a
lower
threshold
and
he
qualifies
for
asylum,
then
he
can't
be
sent
back
to
pakistan.
and
our
point
is
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there's
always
the
possibility
that
the
attorney
general
will
achieve
the
same
result
we
are
saying
the
statute
achieves,
through
an
exercise
of
discretion
that
gets
back
to
that
point.
let
me
rather
briefly
mention
the
other
two
categories
of
considerations
that
support
the
reasonableness
of
the
board's
interpretation.
one
is
the
legislative
history
and
background
of
the
refugee
act
of
1980,
and
it's
important
to
recognize
that
there
were
two
propositions
established
in
our
law
at
the
time
congress
acted
that
are
highly
pertinent
here.
one
is,
as
we
have
recounted
in
our
brief,
asylum
had
been
created
by
regulation
prior
to
its
first
statutory
recognition
in
the
1980
act.
and
those
regulations
had
been
amended
in
1979
to
state
explicitly,
as
we
point
out
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
that
the
standard
for
proving
asylum
is
the
same
as
the
standard
for
proving
withholding
of
deportation.
the
court
recognized
this
in
stevic.
and
against
that
background,
both
the
senate
report
and
expert
testimony
before
congress
referred
to
asylum
and
the
new
provision
as
not
changing
the
substantive
standards.
now,
questions
have
been
raised
about
the
authoritativeness
of
these
statements.
it
is
true
that
the
conference
report
didn't
repeat
that.
the
senate's
version
of
the
bill
on
this
subject
wasn't
the
one
adopted.
nonetheless,
there
was
no
express
repudiation
of
any
of
these
considerations,
and
the
board
has
reasonably
relief
on
this
aspect
of
the
law,
of
the
legislative
background,
as
indicating
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
digress
from
what
had
been
the
established
law
with
respect
to
asylum
at
that
point.
and
the
other
thing
that
was
established
in
our
law
is
that
the
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
language
had
itself
been
interpreted
prior
to
its
use
in
the
1980
law.
that
was
first
interpreted
by
the
board
in
the
dunar
case,
where
a
claim
was
made
that
because
of
that
language
in
the
protocol
the
standards
for
withholding
of
deportation
should
be
changed,
and
the
board
said
in
effect
that
they
concluded
that
it
was
essentially
the
same
standard
as
they
had
been
applying
in
section
3243(h)
for
withholding
of
deportation.
and
two
courts
of
appeals
had
upheld
the
board's
view
on
that,
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit.
we
recount
that
on
page
25
of
our
brief.
and
no
court
at
that
time
had
held
to
the
contrary.
that
was
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
congress
adopted
that
very
language
in
the
act,
and
congress
did
not
say
it
was
using
that
language
with
any
different
meaning
than
had
been
established
in
the
law
at
that
time.
that
too
entitled
the
board
to
rely
on
congress'
use
of
language
that
had
been
authoritatively
interpreted
as
meaning
the
same
thing
as
those
authoritative
interpretations,
rather
than
attributing
some
other
meaning
to
that
language.
and
the
last
category
of
reasons
why
the
board's
interpretation
is
reasonable
is
because
there
is
no
authoritative
source
for
any
other
interpretation
to
give
content
to
the
meaning
of
"well-founded
fear
of
persecution".
the
court
of
appeals
merely
says,
well,
it
should
be
a
subjective
fear
combined
with
some
objective
basis.
well,
if
the
alien's
country
is
persecuting
any
persons
on
the
basis
of
their
political
views
and
the
alien
has
applied
for
asylum,
which
could
be
interpreted
as
a
hostile
act,
there's
always
some
objective
basis.
there
isn't
much
guidance
in
the
standard
developed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
own.
and
the
board,
with
its
vast
experience
in
administering
this
statute,
has
concluded
that
the
practical
standard
is
the
familiar
one
that
it
has
utilized
right
along.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
please.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
simply
don't
agree
that
a
different
standard
applies.
the
claim
of
an
inconsistency
is
based
on
an
interpretation
of
section
207
that
we
don't
agree
with.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
said
it
in
our
reply
brief
on
pages
11
and
12.
203(a)(7)
and
the
other
early
piecemeal
statutes
use
the
phrase
"fear
of
persecution".
they
did
not
use
the
phrase
"well-founded
fear
of
persecution".
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right,
but
that's
not
well-founded.
the
only
time...
there
was
no
reason
to
construe
that
phase,
that
had
not
been
used
prior
to
the
dunar
case...
it
had
not
been
used
in
any
of
these
early
statutes--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
think
there's
some
basis
to
that
view.
but
293(a)(7)
had
a
fear
of
persecution
standard,
not
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
standard.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
different
standard.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
although...
well,
there's
some
basis
for
thinking
that
in
practice
it
was
applied
the
same
way.
but
it
was
not
the
same
language.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
our
main
point.
and
in
footnote
14
of
our
reply
brief,
and
this
is
on
page
11
of
our
reply
brief,
we
pointed
out
that
the
house
report
explicitly
said
at
the
time
of
the
1980
act
that
the
asylum
provision
was
to
provide
a
statutory
basis
for
the
part
108
regulatory
asylum
policy,
not
to
provide
a
statutory
basis
to
replace
the
old
203(a)(7)
or
the
other
earlier
statutes.
and
that
was
the
policy
that
in
the
1979
regulations
said
that
the
asylum
standard
was
the
same
as
the
standard
for
the
withholding
of
deportation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
208
and
207,
yes.
207
applies
to
aliens
abroad.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
we
never
said
that,
nor
do
we
say
it
now.
that's
just
what
the
other
side
says.
we
never
subscribed
to
that,
so
we
don't
have
an
inconsistency.
the
inconsistency
is
formulated
on
their
interpretation
of
207.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
now,
i
also
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
its
decision
in
immigration
and
naturalization
service
against
jong
how
wang,
450
u.s.
139,
the
court
deferred
to
the
ins',
to
the
board's
interpretation
of
a
statutory
term,
244
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act...
nationality
act.
and
it
not
only
deferred
to
the
interpretation,
but
deferred
to
a
categorical
interpretation,
that
the
board
was
entitled
to
take
the
position
that
a
mere
showing
of
economic
detriment
is
not
sufficient
to
show
extreme
hardship
within
the
meaning
of
that
statutory
provision.
and
the
last
point
i
wish
to
make
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
reference
is
made
in
our
statute
to
a
term
in
the
international
protocol
does
not
mean
that
this
case
presents
a
question
of
international
law.
it
does
not
involve
an
international
obligation.
the
only
international
obligation
is
the
withholding
of
deportation
obligation,
and
non-referralment
which
was
before
the
court
in
stevic.
this
is
a
question
of
asylum,
which
is
not
required
by
international
law,
and
the
question
is
what
did
congress
mean
by
using
the
term
in
our
domestic
law.
we
have
shown
in
the
latter
part
of
our
reply
brief
that
there
is
in
any
event
no
uniform
practice
among
other
countries
bound
by
the
protocol
to
interpret
the
protocol
more
generously
in
their
own
practice
than
we
do.
this
is...
we
have
gone
through
in
case
by
case,
but
it's
also
shown
in
an
aggregate
way
by
the
statistics
in
footnote
25
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
because
the
fact
is,
as
those
show,
in
both
1984
and
1985
the
united
states
provided
a
haven
for
more
refugees
and
asylees,
using
our
standard,
than
were
accommodated
in
all
of
europe
and
canada
combined,
which
certainly--
