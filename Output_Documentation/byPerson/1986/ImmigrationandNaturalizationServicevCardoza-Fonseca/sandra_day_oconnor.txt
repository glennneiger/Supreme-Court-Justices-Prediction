justice
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
i'm
also
concerned
by
the
fact
that
congress
considered
an
express
requirement
that
applicants
for
asylum
meet
the
same
standard
required
for
withholding
deportation
and
rejected
it.
and
is
that
something
that
we
should
consider
in
the
balance
here
of
how
much
deference
to
give
to
the
board's
present
interpretation?
justice
o'connor
ms.
keener,
do
you
agree
that
if
you
were
to
prevail
here
that
the
discretion
of
the
agency
would
enable
it
to
accomplish
the
same
thing?
justice
o'connor
your
quarrel
is
with
the
agency's
insistence
that
you
establish
a
reasonable
likelihood?
justice
o'connor
well,
wait
a
minute.
as
i
understand
it,
the
position
urged
by
the
agency
itself,
to
which
we're
asked
to
give
deference,
is
that
the
refugee
has
to
establish
a
realistic
likelihood
that
he
will
be
persecuted
on
his
return.
and
it's
the
likelihood--
justice
o'connor
--language
that
you
object
to?
