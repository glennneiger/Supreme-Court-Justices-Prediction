and

service
versus
luz
marina
cardoza-fonseca.
mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
we'll
hear
from
you
now,
ms.
keener.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
keener,
mr.
wallace,
in
response
to
a
question
from,
i
believe
it
was,
justice
stevens,
said
that,
for
example,
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
been
deferred
to
when
it
was
construing
even
a
provision
of
the
act,
not
that
its
view
was
final
but
that
it
was
given
deference.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
ins
in
this
case
should
be
given
no
deference
simply
because
it
is
construing
a
term
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
my
question
to
you
was,
which
i
don't
think
you've
yet
answered,
is
is
the
agency
entitled
to
no
deference
because
what
it
is
construing
is
a
term
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
deference
one
of
those
factors
or
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ms.
keener,
is
it
your
position
that
the
attorney
general,
in
exercising
his
discretion
in
those
situations,
could
not
lay
down
any
general
rule?
chief
justice
rehnquist
inconsistent
with
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
it
in
the
statute
that
mandates
a
case
by
case
determination,
as
opposed
to
a
determination
based
on
some
more
general
guidelines?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ms.
keener,
how
do
you
evaluate
a
case
on
its
individual
facts
without
knowing
what
rule
to
apply
once
you've
ascertained
what
facts
are
there?
there
has
to
be
some
governing
standard,
doesn't
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
tell
what
the
merits
of
a
case
are,
ms.
keener,
without
having
some
guideline?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
do
we
assume
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
criteria
set
forth
in
the
handbook?
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh,
you
were
just
repeating
his
language?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
know
why
he
assumed
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
keener.
mr.
wallace,
do
you
have
anything
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
is
expired,
mr.
wallace.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
