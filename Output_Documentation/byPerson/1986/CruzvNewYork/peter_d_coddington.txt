mr.
peter
d.
coddington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
precedents
over
the
last,
almost
century
have
made
it
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
confrontation
clause
is
to
advance
the
accuracy
of
the
truth
finding
function
in
a
criminal
trial.
the
precedents
make
clear
that
cross
examination
may
be
dispensed
with
at
trial
when
outweighed
by
public
policy
and
the
necessities
of
the
particular
case.
now,
this
case
arises
from
the
affirmance
of
a
murder
conviction
in
new
york
state,
and
it
gives
the
court
the
opportunity
to
emphasize
that
the
sixth
amendment
recognizes
that
a
criminal
trial
is
a
search
for
the
truth
and
that
the
admission
of
a
co-defendant's
interlocking
confession
in
one
trial
advances
the
accuracy
of
the
truth
finding
function.
now,
as
mr.
dean
said--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--it
was
admitted
with
limiting
instructions
within
the
meaning
of
parker
v.
randolph.
i
submit
further
that
it
also
would
have
been
admissible
in
view
of
this
court's--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
that
theory
was
not
argued
below.
but
i
think
this
court
should
reach
that
issue,
your
honor.
it's
fairly
supported
by
the
record.
it's
fairly
supported
by
the
law.
and
i
submit
that
it's
fairly
included
within
question
one
of
the
cert
petition.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
levy-illinois
was
an
intervening
decision,
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
our
record,
i
think,
clearly
supports
subsequent
admissibility,
i
think
this
court
should
take
this
opportunity
and
make
that
kind
of
ruling
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
first
because
we
thought
that
it
was
admissible
under
parker
v.
randolph
with
limiting
instructions,
and
for
our
purposes--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--i
certainly
would
have,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
your
honor,
that
goes
to
substantive
admissibility
obviously,
in
the
lee
question.
with
respect
to--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
the
co-defendant
who
is
tried
jointly
with
the
petitioner.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's
true,
but
we're
trying
them
both
at
the
same
trial,
your
honor,
and
we
have
to
prove
both
of
them
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
one
trial.
therefore,
i
think
the
probative
value
really
does...
is
very
important
in
the
trial
with
respect--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--that's
correct.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
i
submit
that
that
would
have
no
importance
at
all.
the
jury
was
instructed
to
disregard
that.
we
submit
that--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
no,
your
honor.
that
gets
to
the
bruton
aspect
of
this
case.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
and
i
think
this
court
should
point
out
that
bruton
really
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule.
well,
the
general
rule
is
that
the
jury
follows
the
instructions.
however,
in
bruton
where
only
one
defendant
confesses,
then
the
court
held
that
the
admission
of
that
confession
is
devastating
and
the
jury
cannot
follow
those
instructions.
where
both
defendants
confess,
however,
bruton
does
not
apply,
i
submit.
and
for
that
reason,
the
probative
value
is
relevant
to
that
extent,
your
honor.
where
both
defendants
confess,
i
submit
there
is
no
bruton
problem
and
that
this
court
should
apply
the
rule
that
the
jury
can--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--the
reason
for
that,
judge,
is
that
both
defendants
have
had
their
say.
the
jury
has
heard
both
defendants'
account
of
the
crime
out
of
their
own
mouths,
albeit
through
other
witnesses.
therefore,
there
is
not
the
temptation
to
fill
in
the
gaps.
where
they
have
heard
one
defendant
confess
on
the
one
side
and
heard
nothing
from
the
other,
then
there
is
a
natural
temptation
to
fill
in
the
gaps
by
looking
to
the
co-defendant's
confession.
where,
however,
both
defendants
have
confessed,
i
submit
that
that
temptation
is
far
less,
to
the
extent
that
in
a
joint
trial
with
interlocking--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--i
submit
that
probably
it
is,
your
honor,
because
if
they
interlock
then
you
have
both
defendants
in
effect
saying
the
same
thing,
and
therefore
there
is
even
less
temptation
to
look
to
both
confessions.
they
have
it
out
of
both
defendants'
mouth.
therefore,
i
think
they
can--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
i
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
i
think
the
jury,
under
those
circumstances,
will
be
more
prone
to
follow
the
judge's
instructions,
perhaps
because...
well,
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
they
really
don't
need
to
look
to
the
other
defendant.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
that
would
make
it
inadmissible
under
levy-illinois,
and
under
parker
v.
randolph,
i
submit
that
the
limiting
instructions
were
correct.
now,
i
submit
that
on
the
lee
point,
i
think
there's
no
doubt
at
all
that
this
confession
should
be
substantively
admissible.
it
was
thoroughly
substantiated
by
benjamin's
confession.
it
interlocks
as
to
date,
as
to
place,
as
to
motive,
as
to
participants,
and
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
crime
was
committed.
moreover,
all
of
these
elements
were
substantiated,
thoroughly
substantiated
by
forensic,
photographic
and
ballistics
testimony.
the
confessions
are
obviously
describing
the
same
crime.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
doubt
at
all
that
these
confessions
are
substantively
admissible
within
the
meaning
of
levy-illinois,
and
i
submit
that
although
that
theory
was
not
specifically
argued
below,
if
these
confessions
are
substantively
admissible
it
completely
answers
any
bruton
problem.
it
completely
answers
any
parker
problem.
and
this
is
the
entire
way
that
case
was
argued
below.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's
correct,
your
honor.
both
confessed.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
i
disagree.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's
certainly
true,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
that
that's
a
very,
very
poor
result.
there
are
a
number
of
public
policy
arguments
that
support
joint
trials.
first
and
foremost
is
the
fact
of
a
speedy
trial.
trying
two
defendants
at
once
is
obviously
faster
for
both
defendants,
and
moreover
the
local
jails
are
populated
with
prisoners
who
are
awaiting
speedy
justice
in
their
cases.
clearly,
it
gives
them
the
advantage
of
a
speedy
trial.
also,
it
decreases
the
cost
to
the
state.
that
makes
more
money
available
for
social
needs
and
other
things
that
are
of
state
concern.
and
in
new
york,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
new
york,
as
you
may
not
know,
is
a
transactional
immunity
state
so
severance
and
a
grant
of
immunity
to
benjamin
would
require
us
to
completely
immunize
the
shooter
from
any
liability
for
this
murder.
now,
that
is
an
absurd
result
and
i
don't
think
the
court
should
make
us
do
that.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's
right.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
as
i
understand
my
adversary's
argument--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--i
want
to
do
that
under
lee.
under
parker,
i
want
joint
trials
for
all
the
reasons
that
i've
just
stated.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
i
don't
want
to
immunize
a
murderer,
judge.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
this
i
think
gets
into,
perhaps,
harmless
error
as
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
and
i
submit
that
benjamin's
testimony,
if
error
at
all...
and
i
submit
that
it
wasn't,
or
rather
his
confession,
certainly
was
harmless
error.
now,
eulogio
confessed
to
each
and
every
element
of
the
crime
to
a
person
who
i
submit--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
your
honor,
we
do
want
to
try
these
defendants
jointly
for
the
reasons
of
economy,
of
speedy
justice
for
all
the
defendants.
these
are
worldly
public
policies
that
we
want
to
advance.
clearly,
it
makes
much
more
sense
for
everybody's
sake
to
try
them
jointly.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
no,
we
did.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
we
did.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
no,
they
didn't.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
the
defendants
would,
but
i
wonder
if
this
court
should
allow
these
defendants
to
speak
for
all
the
other
defendants
who
are
sitting
in
jail
awaiting
trials
in
their
cases.
we
only
have
35
working
courts
in
bronx
county,
and
we've
got
probably
5,000
pending
indictments.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
out
there
that
want
a
speedy
trial,
and
trying
two
defendants
at
once
increases
the
odds
of
speedy
justice
in
all
of
those
cases.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
no,
it
wasn't,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's
a
good
question,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
unclear,
actually.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
unclear.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
the
nieves,
that
case
came
out
of
our
office.
that
involved
whether
an
admission
was
admissible
as
a
dying
declaration
or
an
excited
utterance
under
state
law.
at
trial,
our
assistant
conceded
and
said
affirmatively
that
it
could
never
be
an
excited
utterance,
had
to
be
a
dying
declaration.
on
appeal
we
argued
both.
the
intermediate
appellate
court
said,
you
were
wrong
in
your
concession.
it's
not
a
dying
declaration.
it's
an
excited
utterance.
then
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
they
said
we
couldn't
make
that
argument
because
we'd
expressly
disclaimed
it
below.
on
this
record,
however,
the
facts
are
somewhat
different.
here
we
argued
bruden.
we
argued
reliability.
so,
i
think
it's
an
open
question.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
okay.
the
highest
court--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--oh,
i
understand
that
rule,
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
here
the
highest
court
in
the
state
expressly
decided
the
parker
v.
randolph
issue.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
expressly
decided
the
bruton
issue.
although
it
did
not
expressly
decide
the
lee
issue,
the
new
york
telephone
case,
penn
v.
roberts,
that
line
of
cases,
say
that
this
court
can
reach
any
issue
that
the
law
and
the
record
support.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
lee
case
was
an
intervening
decision
that
came
down
after
the
highest
state
court
reached
this
issue--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--i
understand
the
rule
to
be
the
same
in
state
and
federal
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
yes,
i
do.
your
honor,
in
sum,
justice
white
notwithstanding,
i
believe
that
the
court
can
reach
this
case.
i
believe
it
is
substantively
admissible
under
levy-illinois.
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
any
parker
v.
randolph
question
has
been
clearly
answered
and
i
submit
that
there
was
no
error
below.
but
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
find
that
there
were
error,
i
think
harmless
error
is
the
appropriate
answer.
and
were
this
court
to
make
the
finding
that
these
cases,
these
confessions
cannot
interlock
under
any
set
of
facts,
then
i
think
this
court
should
remand
the
case
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
to
consider
these
issues.
however,
i
think
that
relief
would
be
inappropriate
here
because
i
think,
one,
that
it
is
substantively
admissible;
two,
that
it's
admissible
with
limiting
instructions
under
parker
v.
randolph,
and
accordingly
i
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
conviction.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
