don't
you
think,
counsel,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
arguing
that
it
is
admissible
under
a
hearsay
exception,
and
making
that
the
basis
for
the
admission,
which
is
not
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
here,
and
on
the
other
hand
arguing
that
the
fact
that
it
would
have
been
had
one
sought
to
do
that,
renders
the
co-defendant's
confession
admissible?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
sort
of
a
record
would
it
take,
beyond
what
you
have,
to
determine
whether
the
normal
hearsay
exception
for
admissions
against
interest,
against
penal
interest,
would
apply
here?
what
additional
evidence
would
be
necessary,
or
helpful?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
normally
be
able
to
introduce
that
evidence
if
somebody
tried
to
get
it
in
under
the
hearsay
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
certainly
introduce
it
to
the
jury
on
the
basis
that
they
shouldn't
believe
it,
therefore.
but
do
you
have
the
right
to
introduce
it
for
the
purpose
of
saying
that
therefore
the
normal
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
should
not
be
applied?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
cases
that
decline
to
apply
the
admission
against
penal
interest
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
on
the
basis
that,
even
though
it
was
an
admission
against
penal
interest,
there
are
other
indicia
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
confession
that
is
sought
to
be
admitted
against
your
client
by
the
co-defendant,
he
didn't
seek
to
frame
your
client.
he
admitted
that
he
pulled
the
trigger.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
other
confession?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe,
but
one
would
think
that
if
there
was
anything
he
was
going
to
lie
about,
it
would
be
about
the
question
of
who
pulled
the
trigger.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
said,
"i
pulled
the
trigger",
and
not
your
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
going
to
lie
about
it,
it
seems
to
me
you'd
tell
a
more
intelligent
lie
to
say,
"my
brother
pulled
the
trigger".
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dean,
i
understand
you
don't
like
an
interlocking
rule
anyway,
but
if
the
court
were
to
follow
the
plurality
in
parker,
what
is
your
understanding
as
to
what
interlocking
should
require?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
describe
that
concept--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
mean
genuinely
interlock?
you've
just
acknowledged
that
interlock
is
not
the
right
word
to
describe
what
you
genuinely
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
extent
that
it
is
more
reliable
and
more
credible,
the
more
likely
the
jury
is
to
have
ignored
the
instruction
and
relied
upon
it?
i
mean,
the
two
arguments
are
just
crossing
one
another.

cruz
versus
in
new
york
comes
to
us
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
a
criminal
defendant
the
right
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
against
him.
in
bruton
versus
united
states,
we
held
that
that
guarantee
is
violated
when
in
a
joint
trial,
the
incriminating
confession
of
a
non
testifying
codefendant
is
introduced
even
if
the
jury
is
instructed
to
consider
that
confession
only
against
the
codefendant.
later
in
parker
versus
randolph,
the
eight
members
of
the
court
participating
in
the
case
divided
evenly
on
the
question
whether
bruton
applies
where
the
defendant's
own
confession
corroborating
that
if
his
codefendant
is
introduced
against
him.
we
revisited
that
question
in
this
case.
here,
the
petitioner
eulogio
cruz
was
tried
jointly
with
his
brother
benjamin
for
the
murder
of
a
gas
station
attendant.
at
their
trial,
the
prosecution
introduced
benjamin's
videotape
confession
in
which
he
implicated
his
brother
in
the
crime.
the
prosecution
also
called
a
friend
of
the
cruz
brothers
who
recounted
a
conversation
with
them
in
which
they
both
confessed
to
murdering
the
attendant.
both
brothers
were
convicted
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
affirmed
eulogio's
conviction
adopting
the
reasoning
of
the
plurality
opinion
in
parker
that
the
introduction
of
benjamin's
confession
did
not
violate
bruton
because
eulogio
had
himself
confessed
and
his
confession
interlocked
with
that
of
his
brother.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
we
adopt
the
view
of
the
four
dissenting
justices
in
parker
at
the
existence
of
the
defendant's
interlocking
confession
makes
no
difference
to
the
application
of
the
bruton
rule.
we
make
clear
however
that
the
defendant's
confession
maybe
considered
at
trial
in
accessing
whether
his
codefendant's
statements
are
sufficiently
reliable
to
be
directly
admissible
against
him
despite
his
lack
of
opportunity
for
cross-examination,
and
we
also
explained
that
the
defendant's
confession
maybe
considered
on
appeal
in
assessing
whether
any
confrontation
clause
violation
was
harmless.

opinion
