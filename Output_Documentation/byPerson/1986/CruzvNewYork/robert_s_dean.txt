mr.
robert
s.
dean
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
were
the
ones
left
unresolved
by
this
court's
decision
in
parker
versus
randolph.
first,
is
the
bruton
holding
applicable
where
the
state
seeks
to
introduce
confessions
against
both
defendants?
and
secondly,
if
the
bruton
rationale
does
not
apply
if
confessions
interlock,
when
do
confessions
interlock?
in
this
case,
the
only
direct
evidence
linking
either
petitioner
eulogio
cruz
or
his
co-defendant
benjamin
cruz
to
the
crime
were
their
confessions
which
the
state
introduced
against
them.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
yes.
the
state
is
seeking
to
raise
that
point
now
for
the
first
time
before
this
court,
and
in
response
we
have
two
essential
responses.
one
is
that
in
fact,
looking
at
the
evidence
that's
available,
they
have
not
met
their
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
the
presumptive...
the
unreliable
co-defendant's
confession
is
reliable.
but
in
the
first
place,
this
court
should
not
even
consider
that
question
because
it
was
not
presented
in
the
petitions
for
certiorari
or
the
response
to
the
petition.
it
was
not
pressed
or
passed
in
the
state
courts,
and
therefore
petitioner
was
not
given
an
opportunity
to
make
or
contribute
to
the
record
on
the
question
of
whether
this
co-defendant's
confession
is
reliable
as
evidence
connecting
petitioner
to
the
crime.
the
only
question
in
the
state
trial
courts
and
in
the
state
appellate
courts
was
whether
this
confession
impacted
upon
the
defendant,
eulogio
cruz.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
i
understand
the
question,
but
i
think
the
crucial
thing
here
is
that
they
are
pointing
to
evidence
which
came
out
periodically
through
the
record
for
reasons
unrelated
to
this
question.
we
never
had
a
chance
to
contribute
to
the
record
on
this
question.
we
never
got
a
chance,
because
it
wasn't
an
issue
below,
to
help
make
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
confession
was
unreliable
evidence
as
to
our
defendant.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
okay.
first
of
all,
the
motivation
that
benjamin
might
have
to
falsely
implicate
the
petitioner.
we
don't
know
what
the
relationship
is
between
the
brothers.
the
state
is
assuming
that
there
is
some
sort
of
presumption
of
brotherly
love
between
two
brothers,
which
i
don't
think
in
history
or
in
practicality
exist.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
oh,
absolutely.
if
a
state
is
trying
to
introduce
the
co-defendant's
confession
as
evidence
of
petitioner's
guilt,
surely
we
would
have
the
opportunity
to
introduce,
before
the
judge
or
the
jury,
evidence
to
indicate
that
he
had
a
motive
to
falsify
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
oh,
absolutely.
we
have
the
right
to
help...
to
litigate
an
issue
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence
under
a
certain
doctrine,
but
take
the
declaration--
mr.
robert
s.
dean
--yes,
all
the
new
york
state
cases.
first
of
all,
as
to
declaration
against
penal
interest,
this
court
said
in
lee
versus
illinois
that
that
was
too
broad
a
bevy
of
cases
for
confrontation
clause
analysis.
but
furthermore,
whether
a
confession
would
be
admissible
as
a
declaration
against
penal
interest,
which
is
purely
an
evidentiary
doctrine
is
of
state
law.
this
co-defendant's
confession
and
its
accusations
in
it
against
petitioner
would
not
have
been
admissible
under
state
law
for
a
host
of
reasons.
one
is
that
new
york
has
a
special
rule
when
it
comes
to
accomplices'
confessions
at
the
station
house,
that
not
only
must
it
be
against
penal
interest
but
it
must
be
shown
that
there
was
not
even
a
theoretical
motive
to
fabricate.
that
is
to
say,
at
that
point
in
time
the
co-defendant
was
not
cooperating
with
the
police.
so,
under
the
new
york
doctrine
and
the
case
of
people
versus
geoghegan
which
is
cited
in
my
reply
brief,
for
that
reason
alone
it
wouldn't
have
been
admissible
as
a
matter
of
new
york
state
law
as
a
declaration
against
penal
interest.
but
even
more
than
that,
under
new
york's
rule
only
the
self-accusatory
portion
of
the
statement
would
be
admissible
against
the
other
defendant.
so,
if
"a"
is
the
co-defendant
in
this
case,
and
he
says,
"a"
and
"b",
"b"
meaning
my
client,
committed
murder,
under
new
york's
doctrine
only
that
portion,
"a"
committed
murder,
would
be
admissible
against
the
defendant.
and
furthermore,
under
new
york
law,
whatever
the
other
evidence
as
to
declaration
against
penal
interest
might
be,
the
party
against
whom
they
seek
to
admit
it
would
always
have
the
opportunity
to
indicate
by
introduction
of
evidence
that
they
would
have
the
opportunity
to
show
that
the
evidence
was
in
fact
unreliable
and
that
the
standard
indicia
of
admissibility
as
a
declaration
against
penal
interest
are
illusory.
that's
new
york
state
law.
had
respondent
sought
to
introduce
the
co-defendant's
confession
as
substantive
evidence
against
petitioner
in
this
case,
in
new
york
state
courts,
it
would
not
have
been
admissible
under
new
york
state
law.
that
argument
is
fully
laid
out
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
right,
as
in
lee
versus
illinois.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
actually,
i
don't
read
that
difference
in
lee
versus
illinois.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
between
the
pre-arrest
and
the
post-arrest
statement.
if
it's
there,
i
don't
see
it.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
well,
perhaps
so.
but
in
any
event,
the
co-defendant's
videotaped
confession
was
made
after
he
was
placed
under
arrest.
so,
we're
dealing
with
a
post-arrest
videotaped
confession.
the
videotaped
confession
of
the
co-defendant
in
this
case
was
a
22-minute
videotape
taken
by
a
bronx
county
assistant
district
attorney.
the
alleged
confession
that
the
state
introduced
against
petitioner
was
introduced
through
the
testimony
of
a
single
witness,
norberto
cruz
whose
testimony,
we
submit,
was
generally
unworthy
of
belief.
and
furthermore,
he
specifically
had
a
motive
to
frame
petitioner
for
this
crime...
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
s.
dean
no,
i'm
talking
about
the--
mr.
robert
s.
dean
--confession
that
was
introduced
through
norberto
cruz.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
but
in
reference
to
that,
the
co-defendant
in
his
videotaped
confession
said
that,
"my
brother,
he
announced
the
robbery.
"
"he
demanded
money
from
the
attendant.
"
"he
said,
we
will
kill
you
if
you
don't
give
it
over.
"
"he
started
fighting
with
him.
"
and
only
when
he
was
unarmed
did
benjamin
then
shoot
the
attendant
in
defense
of
my
client,
eulogio
cruz.
so,
assuming
that
benjamin
cruz
is
not
well
versed
in
the
law
of
felony
murder,
which
i
think
it
is
safe
to
assume,
and
that
therefore
he
would
not
know
that
a
killing
in
self
defense
is
not
a
defense
to
felony
murder,
i
think
that
one
can
safely
assume
that
the
"against
penal
interest"
quality
of
that
confession
is
certainly
ambiguous.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
well,
that
might
not
be
true
if
to
pull
the
trigger--
mr.
robert
s.
dean
--right,
but
he
pulled
the
trigger
in
self
defense
of
his
brother,
and
of
course
self
defense
for
a
defendant
with
no
prior
involvement
with
the
law
and
the
mentality
of
a
five-year
old
child
could
very
well
be
a
defense
to
murder.
and
then,
all
he
would
be
guilty
of
is
the
mere
robbery.
in
fact,
he
was
fully--
mr.
robert
s.
dean
--well,
in
fact
there
was
testimony
in
this
case
that
benjamin
is
not
an
intelligent
individual.
furthermore,
he
initially
confessed
in
order
to
convince
the
police
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
the
jerry
cruz
homicide.
jerry
cruz
is
the
brother
of
norberto
cruz
who
is
the
principal
witness
against
my
client
in
this
case.
jerry's
brother
was
killed
and
the
police
were
investigating
that
particular
homicide,
and
they
suspected
eulogio
cruz
and
benjamin
cruz
of
committing
the
crime.
so,
they
left
word
in
the
neighborhood
that
they
wanted
to
speak
to
these
fellows
about
the
crime.
benjamin
cruz
came
to
what
turned
out
to
be
the
wrong
precinct,
and
eventually
he
hooked
up
with
the
officer
and
they
asked
him
what
he
knew
about
the
jerry
cruz
homicide.
and
he
says,
"i
don't
know
anything
about
the
jerry
cruz
homicide.
"
"if
i
knew
anything
about
it,
or
if
i
did
it,
i
would
tell
you
because
i
have
big
balls.
"
"i
killed
this
guy
who
was
shooting
at
my
brother
at
a
gas
station
in
the
bronx.
"
so,
what
he
was
trying
to
do,
as
the
government
points
out
in
their
amicus
brief,
is
he
was
trying
to
get
himself
off
the
hook
for
another
homicide
when
he
made
that,
what
the
district
attorney
now
calls
a
spontaneous
statement.
we
don't
actually
know
what
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
were,
surrounding
the
making
of
that
first
statement
or
what
happened
between
the
making
of
that
first
statement,
and
the
ultimate
confession
on
videotape,
because
as
far
as
petitioner
was
concerned
that
wasn't
an
issue
in
the
case
at
that
time,
how
much
of
petitioner's
involvement
was
suggested
to
the
co-defendant
before
he
named
petitioner
in
the
statement,
what
things
might
have
been
said
to
benjamin
in
order
to
suggest
in
his
mind
that
it
would
be
worthwhile
for
him
to
frame
petitioner.
none
of
these
things
were
the
subject
of
inquiry
in
the
trial
court,
simply
because
they
weren't
in
issue
in
the
trial
court
because
counsel
knew
that
this
statement
was
only
going
to
be
admitted
against
the
co-defendant.
and
the
argument
that
he
was
going
to
be
making
on
appeal
to
the
jury
was,
please,
please
obey
the
judge's
instructions
to
ignore
that
evidence
as
to
my
client.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
yes,
absolutely.
under
new
york
procedural--
mr.
robert
s.
dean
--that's
right.
absent
it
being
litigated
in
state
court,
since
we
had
no
opportunity
to
put
in
evidence
to
counter
that
fact,
and
since
it
cannot
be
said
that
there
is
nothing
we
could
have
done
to
counter
that
fact,
under
the
people
versus
nieves
case
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
respondent
would
have
been
barred
as
a
state
procedural
matter
from
raising
that
issue
for
the
first
time,
either
in
the
appellate
division
or
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
appellate
courts,
they
both
recognized
the
radical
difference
in
the
level
of
reliability
that
the
confessions
in
this
case
were
actually
uttered.
but
the
court
said
that,
once
you
find
factual
interlocking...
interlocking
is
the
factual
content...
that
is
the
end
of
the
analysis.
there
is
no
more
analysis
that
needs
to
be
done.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
by
the
court,
but
once--
mr.
robert
s.
dean
--of
course.
a
jury
question,
the
defendant
can
always
argue
that
he
never
made
the
confession,
as
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
that
is
exactly
what
he
argued.
that
was
his
entire
defense
in
this
case.
however,
we
submit
that
the
differing
levels
of
reliability,
that
the
confessions
were
actually
uttered,
makes
bruton
fully
applicable
to
this
case
because
the
essential
question
in
bruton
is,
does
the
state's
case
against
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
become
much
more
persuasive
against
the
defendant
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
videotaped
confession.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
the
co-defendant's
confession,
we
concede,
is
reliable
evidence
of
a
certain
sort.
it's
definitely
reliable
as
evidence
against
its
declarant,
benjamin
cruz.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
it's
not
reliable
evidence
against
our
client,
eulogio
cruz.
but
in
another
case,
a
case
where
the
question
is
litigated
in
the
state
courts
below
and
were
the
co-defendant's
confession
is
found
to
be
reliable
under
the
lee
analysis,
the
confession
is
going
to
come
in
and
bruton
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
case,
just
as
if
the
confession
had
come
in
under
some
other
evidentiary
doctrine.
our
argument
is
that
it's
not
admissible
in
this
case
because,
first,
it's
not
reliable
and
secondly,
because
of
the
procedural
bar.
this
case
might
have
been
different
had
it
been
litigated
in
state
court.
we
submit
that
the
jury
in
this
case
would
naturally
look
to
the
co-defendant's
confession
in
order
to
resolve
its
doubts
about
whether
petitioner's
confession
was
ever
uttered.
from
a
trial
lawyer's
standpoint,
if
i'm
a
trial
lawyer
and
i'm
representing
eulogio
cruz
in
state
court,
the
only
evidence
against
my
client
other
than
a
lot
of
forensic
evidence
which
indicates
that
a
crime
took
place
but
none
of
it
directly
linking
my
client
to
the
crime,
the
only
evidence
is
the
testimony
of
norberto
cruz
who
didn't
tell
the
police
about
this
alleged
confession
for
six
months
and
only
told
the
police
after
his
brother
had
been
shot
and
petitioner,
as
the
witness
said,
took
him
to
the
place
where
they
had
killed
his
brother.
furthermore,
the
court
could
examine
the
record
in
this
case.
norberto's
testimony
in
relevant
part
is
fully
printed
in
the
joint
appendix.
you
can
read
it
for
yourselves,
and
you
can
see
that
cross
examining
this
man
was
like
pulling
teeth.
on
direct
examination
he
testified
he
was
an
auto
mechanic
by
profession.
on
cross
examination
he
conceded
he
had
never
practiced
in
a
shop
or
hadn't
for
the
last
ten
years.
the
last
ten
years
he
practiced
his
trade
on
the
street.
but,
of
course,
later
he
admitted
that
at
the
first
trial
he
had
testified
that
he
hadn't
worked
for
the
past
two
years;
he
had
been
receiving
welfare.
and
of
course,
the
jury
would
naturally
wonder,
what
is
this
able-bodied
man
doing
receiving
welfare,
and
of
course
they'd
be
wondering
whether
he
had
reported
his
side
income
to
the
welfare
board.
but,
all
these
factual
matters
were
for
the
jury.
but
we
submit
that
a
good
case
was
made
out
that
this
evidence
was
in
itself
unreliable.
so,
as
a
trial
lawyer
going
into
court
with
this
evidence,
a
lot
of
forensic
evidence
which
basically
establishes
a
crime
that
was
committed,
and
norberto's
testimony,
i'd
be
fairly
confident
of
an
acquittal
in
that
sort
of
case.
but
if
you
pin
onto
my
client
the
co-defendant's
confession,
which
we
know
is
uttered,
it
comes
before
the
jury
in
a
length
of
22
minutes
so
they
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
blank
it
out
of
their
mind
in
an
instant.
and,
that
confession
fully
implicates
our
client
in
the
crime
and
we
have
no
method
of
cross
examining
it.
we
can't
bring
out
his
earlier
hearing
testimony
as
a
prior
inconsistent
statement,
the
hearing
testimony
being
completely
different
from
what
he
said
on
the
videotape.
we're
not
entitled
to
an
instruction
from
the
court
that
as
an
accomplice
his
testimony
must
be
corroborated
as
a
matter
of
law
by
other
evidence
materially
linking
petitioner
to
the
crime.
we're
not
entitled
to
any
of
that.
we're
not
entitled
to
introduce
other
evidence
to
show
the
bias
of
this
declarant
as
if
he
had
been
a
witness
on
the
stand.
we're
not
entitled
to
do
any
of
this.
all
we
have
is
this
co-defendant's
confession
which
we
have
no
way
of
challenging,
and
under
those
circumstances
i'd
be
very
worried
about
taking
that
case
to
trial
because
the
state's
case
under
those
circumstances
seems
very
persuasive,
and
we
submit
that
that
exactly
is
what
the
bruton
case
is
all
about.
now,
in
relating
the
lee
versus
illinois
case
to
the
bruton
rule,
we
submit
the
relationship
is
simply
this:
if
a
co-defendant's
confession
is
admissible
under
lee
versus
illinois,
and
this
is
of
course
assuming
that
the
issue
was
litigated
in
the
state
court,
then
certainly
there
is
no
bruton
problem
because
the
evidence
comes
in
as
substantive
evidence.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
it
it's
admissible
and
admitted
against
the
defendant,
if
the
state
litigates
the
question,
then
of
course
there
is
no
bruton
problem.
the
reliable
evidence
comes
in
for
what
it's
worth.
but
if
the
evidence
is
not
reliable,
and
bruton
says
that
these
confessions
of
the
co-defendants
are
presumptively
unreliable,
the
evidence
is
not
reliable,
the
defendant
should
not
be
saddled
with
going
to
trial
with
that
confession
coming
before
the
jury
with
no
way
to
challenge
it.
either
the
judge
should
redact
or
the
judge
should
sever.
if
the
judge
severs,
then
what's
going
to
happen
is
that
there
is
going
to
be
two
fair
trials
taking
place,
and
that
is
the
result
that
should
have
happened
in
this
case.
and,
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
robert
s.
dean
--the
new
york
court
of
appeals
says
that
they
interlocked
as
a
factual
matter
and
any
difference
in
the
level
of
interlocking
as
to
any
other
form,
whether
its
reliability
that
it
was
actually
uttered,
or
voluntariness,
or
truth
was
irrelevant
to
the
confrontation
clause
question,
citing
parker
versus
randolph.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
well,
the
plurality
crossed
the
bridge,
although
the
plurality
in
parker
did
not
actually
address
the
question
of
when
confessions
interlock,
although
there
is
a
broad
reading
of
it
which
would
say
that
any
time
the
defendant
confesses,
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
inquiry
because
any
time
the
defendant
has
himself
confessed,
then
there's
nothing
that
he
could
have
done
in
order
to
challenge
the
co-defendant's
confession
in
any
event.
and
in
any
event,
the
effect
on
the
defendant's
case
is
not
going
to
be
devastating.
but,
this
case
is
an
example
of
why
you
really
have
to
look
closer
at
whether
interlocking
occurs,
because
of
course
the
jury
is
going
to
look
to
the
co-defendant's
confession
in
order
to
resolve
its
doubts
about
appellant's
guilt.
just
because
the
state
introduces
evidence
that
a
co-defendant
confessed,
doesn't
mean
that
the
defendant
has
no
case
left
and
that
there
is
no
further
point
in
challenging
the
co-defendant's
confession.
just
as
one
example,
under
crane
versus
kentucky,
the
defendant
has
the
option
of
relitigating
the
voluntariness
of
his
confession
to
the
jury,
even
if
he
has
lost
on
that
issue
in
a
pretrial
suppression
hearing.
suppose
he
convinces
the
jury
in
a
case
where
a
judge
has
failed
to
redact
or
sever
and
there
are
two
confessions,
let's
say
the
defendant
convinces
the
jury
that
his
confession
was
involuntary
and
therefore
the
jury
should
ignore
it.
then,
the
case
becomes
factually
indistinguishable
from
bruton.
what
we
have
is
no
confession
on
one
side,
and
a
confession
on
the
other
side
that
the
jury
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
ignore.
the
same
thing
is
present
in
our
case.
if
the
defendant,
despite
the
odds,
with
the
co-defendant's
confession
being
before
the
jury,
convinces
the
jury
that
he
never
made
his
confession
in
the
first
place,
then
there's
still
the
co-defendant's
confession
before
the
jury
and
the
case
is
exactly
the
same,
analytically
and
factually,
as
was
presented
in
bruton.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
okay.
if
there
is
anything
in
or
about
the
co-defendant's
confession
that
is
far
more
damaging,
or
even
significantly
more
damaging
to
the
petitioner's
case
than
his
own
confession,
then
they
do
not
interlock.
anything
factually
in
the
confession
in
terms
of
the
wording
or
anything
about
the
confession
may
have
been
a
very
good
case
that
it
was
involuntary,
or
never
made,
or
just
untruthful.
there's
no
reason
why
those
factors
should
be
excluded
from
the
weighing
analysis
as
to
whether
confessions
interlock.
if
the
jury
is
naturally
going
to
look
to
the
co-defendant's
confession
to
resolve
its
doubts
about
the
defendant's
own
confession,
then
those
confessions
don't
interlock.
so,
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
if
there
is
anything
in
or
about
the
co-defendant's
confession
which
is
more
damaging
to
the
defendant's
case
than
his
own
confession.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
i
didn't
first
use
the
word.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
that's
correct.
our
position
is
actually
that
harmless
error
analysis
is
the
analysis
that
should
be
adopted.
but
even
if
the
question
is
whether...
is
not
harmless
error
but
whether
there's
an
error
under
bruton
at
all,
still
there
should
be
an
examination
as
to
whether
confessions
genuinely
interlock
and
not
just
a
question
of
whether
the
defendant
confessed
or
whether
there
is
some
interlock
in
the
words
of
the--
mr.
robert
s.
dean
--i'm
using
a
shorthand,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
there
should
be
a
genuine
look
at
whether
this
co-defendant's
confession
is
damaging
to
the
defendant's
case.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
i
would
just
like
to
address
a
few
points
that
my
opponents
made.
one
is
with
regard
to
justice
o'connor's
question
as
to
the
more
reliable
the
co-defendant's
confession
becomes
the
more
there
seems
to
be
a
bruton
problem.
the
co-defendant's
confession
is
much
more
reliable
than
the
defendant's
confession
in
this
case
in
the
sense
that
we
know
that
it
was
made.
furthermore,
it's
reliable
evidence
against
the
co-defendant.
but
in
no
way
are
we
conceding
that
it
has
any
reliability
connecting
petitioner
to
the
crime,
which
would
be
the
essential
question
in
determining
its
admissibility
against
my
client.
also
as
to
justice
white's
question
concerning,
would
there
have
been
a
procedural
bar
if
respondent
had
first
argued
the
substantive
admissibility
in
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals.
in
the
nieves
case
which
is
cited
on
footnote
2
of
page
4
of
my
reply
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
repeated
an
oft-stated
new
york
rule
which
is
that
an
appellate
court
can
affirm
a
judgment
of
conviction
on
an
issue
not
raised
by
the
prosecutor
below,
only
if
had
the
prosecutor
raised
the
issue
below,
the
other
party
could
have
put
in,
quote
unquote,
"no
possible
answer"
to
that
issue
when
it
had
been
raised
below.
i
think
that
a
simple...
a
quick
reading
of
the
nieves
cite
would
answer
justice
white's
question
in
that
respondent
would
have
definitely
been
barred
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
from
raising
that
issue.
that's
on
page
4
of
our
reply
brief.
okay.
just
to
emphasize
a
few
more
points,
one
is,
if
the
question
is
one
that
should
be
determined
prior...
if
the
question
of
severance
is
one
that
should
be
determined
prior
to
trial
by
the
trial
judge,
merely
subject
to
appellate
review
on
harmless
error
analysis,
there's
no
reason
why
the
trial
judge
should
not
feel
free
to
consider
all
factors
as
to
whether
confessions
interlock,
not
just
whether
they
interlock
as
to
factual
content.
all
the
other
factors,
how
good
a
case
the
defendant
could
make
as
to
voluntariness,
as
to
whether
it
was
made
at
all,
as
to
whether
it
was
true,
all
those
factors
could
be
taken
into
account
by
a
trial
judge
before
the
trial.
i'd
just
like
to
emphasize
that
our
point
is
essentially
this:
that
in
determining
whether
the
defendant's
confession
was
actually
uttered
at
all,
they
are
naturally
going
to
look
to
the
co-defendant's
confession
in
this
case.
and
then
even
if
they
convince
the
jury,
notwithstanding
that,
that
the
confession
was
never
uttered,
even
then
they
have
the
same
problem
that
was
outlined
in
bruton
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
right,
but
in
this
case--
mr.
robert
s.
dean
--no,
because
in
this
case,
assuming
that
the
jury
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
obey
the
limiting
instructions
and
that
they
are
going
to
consider
the
co-defendant's
confessions,
and
the
question
is
really,
does
that
damage
the
defendant's
case.
that's
the
essence
of
the
question.
if
they
are
not
going
to
obey
those
limiting
instructions,
is
the
result
going
to
be
devastating
to
the
defendant's
case,
and
we
submit
it
would
be
in
this
case
because
the
co-defendant's
confession
is
far
more
powerful
and
far
more
damaging
to
the
defendant.
mr.
robert
s.
dean
thank
you.
