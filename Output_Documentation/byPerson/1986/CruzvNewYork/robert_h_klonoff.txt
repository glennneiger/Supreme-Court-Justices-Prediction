mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
first
begin
by
addressing
the
parker
versus
randolph
point
and
then
move
back
to
the
lee
versus
illinois
point
as
a
secondary
point.
on
the
parker
versus
randolph
issue,
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
plurality
decision
in
parker
was
correctly
decided
and
correctly
reasoned.
we
would
ask
the
full
court
to
accept
that
rationale.
this
is
not
simply
an
issue
of
semantics
or
focus.
it
has
enormous
practical
significance
from
the
standpoint
of
a
trial
judge,
and
what
the
trial
judge
should
be
doing,
because
if
the
court
adopts
a
harmless
error
approach,
then
the
result
is
that
even
in
an
interlocking
confession
case
it's
error
and
the
trial
court
is
required
either
to
sever
the
cases
or
to
exclude
the
confession.
if
the
court
adopts
an
interlocking
confession
rationale,
on
the
contrary,
the
court
would
be
able
to
make
an
inquiry
on
whether
there
is
in
fact
true
interlocking,
and
if
there
is,
proceed
to
a
joint
trial.
and
the
parker
versus
randolph
case
itself
dramatizes
the
significance
of
the
distinction.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
defined
it,
justice
blackmun,
as
the
two
confessions
being
substantially
the
same
and
consistent
on
all
the
major
elements
of
the
offense.
it's
the
approach
that's
been
taken
by
the
second
circuit,
and
we
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
our
brief.
the
parker
case
is
a
dramatization
of
this.
justice
blackmun
observed
in
his
concurring
opinion
that
there
was
no
substantial
prejudice
to
any
of
the
defendants
as
a
result
of
the
admission
at
the
joint
trial.
and
there
were
five
defendants
that
were
tried
together
in
parker
versus
randolph.
now,
if
there
was
no
substantial
prejudice
to
any
of
the
defendants,
then
the
united
states
does
not
understand
a
rule
that
would
nonetheless
require
severance,
and
in
parker
we
submit
that
it
may
have
required
five
separate
trials
even
though
we
agree
that
none
of
the
defendants
was
prejudiced.
so,
we
think
that
the
better
approach
to
a
harmless
error
is
a
question
of
interlocking
confessions,
and
the
definition
we
suggest
to
the
court
deals
with
many
of
the
problems
that
were
addressed
by
justice
blackmun
and
by
the
defendant
parker,
because
we
concede
that
there
does
have
to
be
full
interlocking.
a
statement
such
as
the
one
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
about
somebody
who
simply
acknowledges
being
with
someone
else
at
the
time
of
a
crime,
that's
enough...
that's
not
enough
under
the
government's
view.
that
would
not
be
interlocking.
so,
that
hypothetical
would
not
apply.
the
statements
would
have
to
agree
on
the
elements
of
the
offense
so
that
one
would
not
supply
anything
that
the
other
one
would
not
have.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
do,
justice
stevens,
and
we
would
note
that
all
of
the
courts
below
that
addressed
the
matter
found
that
the
statements
interlocked
and
that
both
of
them
independently
established
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
so,
we
would
submit
that
there
is
interlocking
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
now,
the
rationale
of
parker
versus
randolph...
justice
stevens
had
asked
the
question...
there
are
several
points
that
should
be
made
in
that
regard,
as
to
why
the
rationale
of
the
plurality
is
correct.
first
of
all,
it
proceeds
from
the
assumption
that
juries
can
and
will
follow
instructions,
and
that
is
the
general
rule,
and
we
submit
that
bruton
is
the
exception.
we
would
also
say
that
that
rule
is
not
a
fiction.
if
it
were,
defense
lawyers
and
prosecutors
would
not
argue
at
length
about
the
precise
wording
of
instructions
that
go
to
juries,
and
appellate
courts
would
not
reverse
convictions
because
of--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--because,
for
example,
if
one
confession
makes
out
all
of
the
elements
to,
say,
a
murder
and
the
other
one
only
makes
out
the
elements
to
a
manslaughter,
then
the
jury
might
be
tempted
to
fill
a
gap.
it's
precisely
the
analysis
in
parker,
is
will
the
jury
be
tempted
to
look
to
the
co-defendant's
confession
in
order
to
fill
a
gap.
and
when
they
interlock,
then
there
really
is
nothing
in
the
co-defendant's
confession
that
is
not
also
in
the
defendant's
confession.
so,
it's
the
interlocking
on
the
elements
of
the
offense
that
would
really
make
the
jury
resist
looking
at
the
co-defendant's
confession.
now,
the
parker
case
really
has
two
separate
but
related
rationales.
the
first
is
that
the
defendant
who
has
also
confessed
is
harmed
less
by
a
jury's
failure
to
follow
the
instructions
to
keep
the
confession
separate,
the
type
of
a
harmless
error
analysis,
and
really
it
could
be...
a
related
point
is
that
cross
examination
of
the
co-defendant
in
that
circumstance
would
be
less
useful.
and
the
second
point
is
simply
that
in
this
context,
where
the
confessions
genuinely
interlock,
there
is
less
temptation
on
the
part
of
the
jury
to
look
to
the
co-defendant's
confession
and
we
would
note
that
many,
many
courts
have
adopted
this
doctrine.
it's
a
doctrine
that
was
adopted
by
the
second
circuit
almost
immediately
after
the
bruton
case
because
of
its
logical
appeal.
now,
also
on
the
point
of
whether
these
confessions
interlock,
i
would
make
one
point,
to...
just
to
clarify
the
record
in
terms
of
perspective.
there's
been
constant
reference
to
a
22-minute
confession.
the
confession...
the
tape
of
the
confession
has
been
lodged
with
the
court
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
examine
it
because
much
of
it
has
to
do
with
the
translation,
with
the
advising
of
rights,
and
really
the
confession
of
the
co-defendant
dealing
with
the
crime
in
question
occupies
six
pages
of
the
joint
appendix--
so,
there
is
not
really
the
disparity
that
the
shorthand
reference
of
the
22-minute--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
we
would
disagree
with
petitioner's
characterization
that
there
really
is
a
serious
question
about
whether
the
confession
was
made.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
correct.
there
is
a
difference.
but
we
would
just
suggest,
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
footnote
2
of
its
opinion,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
norberto
had
any
motive
to
falsely
accuse
the
petitioner
of
the
offense.
that
was
just
thoroughly
rejected
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
based
on
a
review
of
the
record.
so,
there
really
is
not
that
motive
in
this
case.
in
fact,
as
this
court
noted
in
chambers
versus
mississippi,
a
statement
made
to
a
long-time
friend
may
in
fact
be
the
most
reliable
type
of
statement.
let
me,
if
i
could,
move
to
the
lee
versus
illinois
point
in
the
time
remaining.
in
terms
of
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
lee
versus
illinois,
there
are
really
three
points
that
should
be
emphasized
because
the
court
in
that
case
found
that
the
co-defendant's
confession
was
not
sufficiently
reliable
to
come
in
as
substantive
evidence.
and
by
the
way,
the
substantive
evidence
argument,
let
me
indicate,
is
not
that
it
was
actually
introduced
as
substantive
evidence,
but
that
since
it
could
have
been
introduced
as
substantive
evidence,
the
defendant
is
not
in
a
position
to
complain
where
the
confession
in
fact
was
introduced
only
against
the
co-defendant
with
limiting
instructions.
so,
it's
an
a
fortiori
type
argument.
but
there
are
three
important
distinctions
between
this
case
and
lee,
and
the
first
case...
and
in
fact,
it
relates
to
your
point,
justice
stevens...
the
fact
that
the
confession
was
on
videotape
makes
this
case
totally
different
than
lee.
it
really
enhances
the
reliability
from
the
lee
versus
illinois
analysis.
and
really,
the
jury
was
able
to
focus
on
the
demeanor
of
benjamin
and
they
were
able
to
see
the
circumstances
of
the
statement
as
the
statement
was
given.
so,
although
there
was
not
cross
examination,
there
were
still
other
aspects
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
designed
to
protect.
secondly,
the
videotaped
confession
could
be
looked
at,
really,
as
only
a
more
extensive--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--and
they
cross
for
the
petitioner
who
throughout
the
litigation
had
argued
strenuously
that
the
co-defendant's
confession
was
strongly
reliable.
so,
there
is
that
kind
of--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that's
correct.
we
would
agree
with
justice
o'connor's
observation
that
where
a
confession
is
strongly
reliable,
that
really
ought
to
suggest
that
it
should
be
admitted,
that
there
is
less
of
a
confrontation
problem.
but
the
second
point,
in
addition
to
the
videotape
aspect,
is
the
fact
that
the
videotape
really
was
almost
like
a
summary
of
what
had
already
gone
on
before.
it
was
the
third
statement,
and
there
were
two
spontaneous
statements
preceding
the
videotape.
there
was
the
statement
to
the
friend,
the
civilian,
a
lifelong
friend,
and
then
there
was
the
spontaneous
statement
made
to
the
police
before
the
co-defendant
was
really
under
investigation
as
a
target
for
this
offense.
so,
that
distinguishes
the
station
house
situation
that
was
present
in
lee
versus
illinois,
a
custodial
situation
where
the
co-defendant
did
not
want
to
talk
at
all
at
first,
wanted
to
think
about
the
matter,
and
only
agreed
to
talk
after
prompting.
this
was
a
spontaneous
statement
twice
made
both
to
civilians
and
to
the
police
later.
third,
there
are
no
important
differences
between
the
confessions
of
the
defendant
and
the
co-defendant,
and
this
is
a
dramatic
distinction
from
lee.
first
of
all,
in
lee
the
co-defendant's
confession
was
the
confession
that
supplied
the
element
of
premeditation.
in
this
case,
as
i
indicated
and
as
the
courts
below
found,
both
of
the
confessions
agreed
on
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
both
confessions
established
all
of
the
elements
of
felony
murder.
similarly,
in
lee
versus
illinois
there
was
a
serious
question
concerning
whether
or
not
the
defendant
lee
was
actually
taking
the
blame
for
one
of
the
two
murders.
in
fact,
there
was
indication
that
she
was
denying
it.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up,
and
i
would
simply
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
conviction.
thank
you.
