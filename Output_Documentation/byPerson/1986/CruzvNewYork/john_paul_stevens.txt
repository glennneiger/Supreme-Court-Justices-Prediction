justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
there,
mr.
coddington,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
co-defendant's
confession
was
admitted
or
not
admitted
against
the
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you
are
arguing
separately,
it
would
have
been
admissible
but
it
was
not
expressly
admitted
against
the
defendant,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
suppose
it
was
not
argued
to
be
admissible
in
the
new
york
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
you
have
been
better
off
without
the
limiting
instruction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
not
presume
the
jury
followed
the
limiting
instruction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
if
you
do,
what
relevance
does
the
probative
value
of
the
second
confession
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
for
the
moment,
just
confine
your...
i
understand
you
make
that
separate
argument,
but
under
your
interlocking
argument,
if
you
presume
that
the
jury
followed
the
limiting
instructions,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
second
confession
was
probative
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
not
arguing
about
the
co-defendant's
case,
now.
we're
just
talking
about
the
impact
on
the
petitioner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
important
in
the
trial
of
the
co-defendant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
relevance
is
it
insofar
as
your
arguing
about
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then
it
would
be
totally
irrelevant
that
the
confession
either
interlocked
or
did
not
interlock,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
there
no
bruton
problem?
i
don't
understand.
i
know
you
say
that,
but
what
is
the
reason
for
saying
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
any
less
whether
there
is
an
interlock
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it
would
work
just
in
reverse.
if
you
hear
them
both
say
the
same
thing,
you're
more
apt
to
believe
them
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
more
apt
to
rely
on
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
need
to
look
to
it
because
they've
heard
it
and
it
corroborates
the
defendants--
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
would
you
give
immunity
to
benjamin,
because
under
your
theory...
the
case
was
tried
on
a
theory
that
his
testimony
wasn't
admitted
against
this
defendant
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
how
would
transactional
immunity
for
benjamin
even
hurt
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
you
need
the
co-defendant's
confession
and
you
want
to
establish
its
admissibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
one
of
the
reasons
was
transactional
immunity
for
a
witness
that
you
say
you
didn't
need.
therefore,
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
need
his
testimony
under
your
view
of
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
again,
if
it's
harmless
error,
it's
another
way
of
saying
you
didn't
need
his
testimony.
so,
i
don't
understand
your
transactional
immunity
argument.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
ask
for
a
joint
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
ask
for
a
joint
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
defendants
didn't
want
a
joint
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
rather
have
taken
the
extra
delay
that
was
involved
in
two
separate
trials?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
confessions
in
this
case
satisfy
your
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
if
you
make
that
assumption,
why
do
you
have
to
have
all
of
the
elements
interlock,
if
you
presume
that
the
jury
follows
the
instruction
and
disregards
the
co-defendant's
confession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
there
is
this
disparity,
that
there's
no
question
at
all
that
that
confession
was
in
fact
made.
but
at
least
it's
arguable
that
the
witness
was
lying
about
the
second
confession.
at
least,
there
is
that
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
at
least
you
can
make
the
argument.
you
can't
even
make
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
tape
recorded
confession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
whether
you
want
to
consider
all
those
other
factors
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
they
interlock,
depends
on
what
you
think
the
purpose
of
interlocking
is,
and
perhaps
if
the
purpose
is
what
the
government
suggests,
that
it
will
make
it
less
likely
that
the
jury
will
disobey
its
instructions,
you
may
be
right.
but,
what
if
the
purpose
of
the
interlocking
requirement
is
simply
not
to
say
that
the
jury
will
be
less
likely
to
ignore
its
instructions,
but
to
demonstrate
that
their
ignoring
of
those
instructions
is
less
likely
to
be
harmful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
in
that
case
all
you
really
need
is
the
interlocking
facts.
