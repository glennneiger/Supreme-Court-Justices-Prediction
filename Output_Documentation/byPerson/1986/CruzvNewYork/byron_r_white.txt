justice
byron
r.
white
--haven't
we
recognized
that
there
is
a
presumption
against
the
reliability
of
co-defendants
post-arrest
confessions,
and
whether
they
contain
admissions
against
penal
interest
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
as
contrasted
with
pre-arrest,
pre-custody
statements
against
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
between
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
it
may
not
be.
if
there
isn't
any
difference,
the
business
about
the
admissibility
of
statements
against
penal
interest
is
an
empty
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
clear
that
there
would
have
been
a
procedural
bar
to
this
issue
being
raised
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
couldn't
have
been
raised
and
decided
in
the
highest
court
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
a
jury
question,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
it
is
unbelievable?
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
the
confession
was
inadmissible,
so
you
couldn't
have
any
of
the
confessions
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
both
defendants
confess?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
couldn't...
if
you
lost
this
case,
neither
confession
should
be
admissible,
because
the
other
defendant
will
object
to...
the
other
defendant
will
always
object
to
the
admitting
the
other
confession.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
you
would
have
to
try
them
separately.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
your
argument
about
substantive
admissibility--
justice
byron
r.
white
--wasn't
raised
in
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
could
you
have
raised
it
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
or
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
unclear?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
there's
no
procedural
bar
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
no
procedural
bar.
nevertheless,
there's
a
rule
around
here
that
we
don't
consider
issues
from
a
state
court
that
weren't
presented
and
decided
by
the
highest
court
in
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that...
you
understand
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
should
we
reach
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
don't
recognize
any
difference
between
a
case
that's
here
from
a
federal
court
and
from
a
state
court,
insofar
as
the
ability
of
the
respondent
to
raise
any
issue
that
would
defend
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do?
