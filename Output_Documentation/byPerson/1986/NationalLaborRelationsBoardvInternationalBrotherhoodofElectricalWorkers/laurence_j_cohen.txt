mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
view
at
the
questions
thus
far,
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
emphasizing
the
nature
of
the
union
rule
in
this
case,
because
it
is
at
the
heart
of
the
case.
this
rule
of
the
ibw,
which
goes
back
to
its
founding
in
1891,
prohibits
members
from
working
for
employers
who
are
adverse
to
its
interest,
in
this
case
by
paying
wages
and
working
conditions
less
than
those
negotiated
by
the
union.
the
force
of
the
rule,
which
was
common
in
1947
as
we
note
in
the
brief
and
is
common
today
is
directed
to
and
falls
upon
the
union
members,
whatever
their
job
classification
may
be.
it
in
essence
requires
their
loyalty
by
not
making
themselves
available
to
those
employers
who
would
undercut
the
conditions
which
the
union
has
achieved,
and
in
this
case,
i
might
add,
it's
clear
that
the
rule
long
predated
the
employment,
or
probably
even
the
existence
of
messrs.
choate
and
schoux.
i
would
like
to
respond
at
this
point,
justice
scalia,
to
your
question
about
the
pool.
i
disagree
completely
with
mr.
ganzfried
in
that,
if
this
situation
had
come
up
as
follows:
mr.
choate
goes
to
his
union
office
and
says,
"there's
a
job
open
for
me
at
xyz
electric,
they
are
non-union
but
i
need
the
acney,
is
there
a
problem
if
i
go
to
work
for
them?
"
and
the
union
agent
says,
"absolutely.
"
"look
at
these
provisions
in
the
constitution.
"
"if
you
take
that
job
it
will
be
a
violation.
"
"i
personally
will
bring
charges
against
you.
"
"the
last
supervisor
who
worked
for
a
non-union
employer
was
fined
$5,000.
"
and
mr.
choate
thinks
about
it
and
decides
that
he's
not
going
to
work.
i
think
it
is
simply
inconceivable
that
that
has
restrained
any
employer
in
his
rights
under
section
8(b)(1)(b).
i
think,
as
you
were
pointing
out,
it
may
restrain
or
coerce
mr.
choate
but
that
is
not
what
section
8(b)(1)(b)
is
all
about.
the
rule
here
is
simply
the--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
--i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
don't,
but
i
understand.
this
case
is
the
other
side,
of
course,
of
the
hypothetical
i
have
just
mentioned,
and
we
think
the
rule
should
be
no
different
if,
having
deliberately
breached
the
rule,
he
is
then
disciplined
for
that
reach
of
the
rule.
this
court,
in
fact
in
several
cases
which
we
have
cited
has
noted
that
these
rules
are
not
only
legitimate
but
serve
a
vital
interest
to
the
union,
namely
the
elimination
of
wage
competition.
i
would
point
out
that
in
abc
where
the
court
did
uphold
the
board's
decision,
it
specifically
referred
to
the
board's
decision
in
that
case
as
reaching,
and
i
quote,
8(b)(1)(b)
as
established
in
florida
power.
that's
at
page
430.
here,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
board
has
gone
beyond
those
boundaries
in
reaching
out
to
this
rule
which
does
no
more
than
limit
the
pool.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
nutter
and
royal
and
the
union.
there
are
no
dealings
between
the
parties,
and
the
ongoing
collective
bargaining
relationship
was
precisely
the
situation
which
senators
taft
and
ellender
spoke
to
in
the
debates...
we
have
set
those
forth
in
some
detail
in
the--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
--well,
the
particular
phrase
which
the
board
seizes
on
in
footnote
37
is
the
employer's
choice
of
a
grievance
representative
with
respect
to
employees
represented
by
other
unions.
at
first
glance
it
may
seem
that
that's
the
situation
we
have
here.
we
submit,
however,
that
that
statement
was
made
in
the
context
of
an
existing
collective
bargaining
relationship
because
the
writers
guild
did
represent
what
has
become
known
as
the
"hyphenates"
in
that
case.
therefore,
there
was
a
potential
for
an
interference
with
an
existing
collective
bargaining
relationship.
here,
there
is
no
such
relationship.
there
is
no
potential
interference
with
it.
and
that
is
the
difference
we
see
between
this
case
and
abc.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
it
could
be,
but
the
court
seemed
to
be
directing
it
toward
the
situation
it
had
before
it,
where
there
were
several
unions
and
some
of
the
"hyphenates"
in
question
were
not
represented
by
the
writers
guild.
certainly,
the
court
did
not
address
the
situation
we
have
here
where
the
union
imposing
the
discipline
has
no
contact
whatsoever
with
the
employers.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
don't
think
it
would,
as
we
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court.
but
the
short
answer
is,
that
situation
just
did
not
occur
here.
as
far
as
the
administrative
law
judge
went,
was
to
say
that
the
discipline
imposed
in
november
and
december
of
1982
was
intended
to
force
the
breakup
of
a
multi-employer
unit,
the
old
unit,
back
in
september
of
1981.
but
apart
from
illogic
of
that,
we
have
another
ally.
we
have
another
board
decision
arising
out
of
these
precise
facts
and
that
is
the
arden
electric
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
issued
a
year
after
this
decision
of
the
board.
in
that
case,
the
board
found
that
nica,
and
i
quote,
"agreed
to
the
dissolution"
of
the
multi-employer
unit,
and
even
more
pointedly
noted
that
the
unit,
"was
dissolved
by
the
parties'
consent
to
the
disclaimer.
"
in
1981.
as
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out,
it
simply
seems
inconceivable
that
fines
against
two
individuals
in
november
and
december
of
1982
could
have
been
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
the
breakup
of
a
unit
in
september
1981
which
the
parties
had
dissolved
consensually.
one
of
the
anomalies
of
this
board
decision
is
that
if
it
stands,
a
union
could
discipline
rank
and
file
members
but
not
supervisor
members
for
the
same
breach
of
the
same
union
rule.
another
court...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
except
that
it
is
anomaly
of
abc,
as
it
stands
in
the
context
of
some
sort
of
bargaining
relationship.
this
would
carry
that
anomaly
one
step
further.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
question
you
raised.
you
asked
if
the
discipline,
whether
it's
a
fine
or
even
expulsion,
would
result
in
a
loss
of
livelihood.
under
the
act,
it
is
clear
that
it
would
not
and
lawfully
could
not.
even
if
someone
is
expelled
from
the
union,
is
no
longer
a
member
of
the
union,
he
must
be
referred
to
jobs...
i'm
referring
to
the
construction
industry
now
with
its
hiring
halls...
without
discrimination.
that
is
the
lesson
of
this
court's
decision
almost
30
years
ago
in
teamsters
local
357.
so,
even
expulsion
would
not
result
in
a
loss
of
working
opportunities.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
precisely,
and
when
they
do
not,
the
board
is
very
quick
to
discipline
them
for
that.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
we
think
primarily
in
the
obtaining
of
higher
benefits
and
better
working
conditions.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
agree
with
you,
that
that
is
a
very
strong
argument
against
free
riders.
but
we
were
unable
to
convince
the
congress
in
1965
to
repeal
14-b.
until
we
do,
we
are
left
with
that
injustice.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the
legislative
history.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
they
can
be
charged,
although
not
to
an
extent
of
dues
for
use
of
a
hiring
hall,
that
is
true.
we
have
set
forth
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
the
legislative
history
of
8(b)(1)(b),
and
the
one
thing
that
it
shows
clearly
is
that
congress,
and
particularly
the
principal
sponsors,
envisioned
it
as
a
narrow
provision
which
was
aimed
at
two
specific
evils;
forcing
an
employer
to
get
rid
of
a
particular
supervisor
who
was
deemed
objectionable
to
the
union
because
of
the
way
in
which
he
had
performed
his
managerial
services,
or
forcing
employers
into
or
out
of
multi-employer
units.
as
i
have
mentioned,
this
rule
does
neither.
it
simply
seeks
to
prevent
the
erosion
of
the
union's
negotiated
standards
by
requiring
that
its
members
not
make
themselves
available
to
work
for
those
employers
who
would
undercut
those
standards.
all
of
the
examples
used
in
the
legislative
history
clearly
make
sense
only
in
the
context
of
a
collective
bargaining
relationship.
as
mr.
taft
said,
we
do
not
like
mr.
"x"
and
you
must
get
rid
of
him.
senator
ellender
said,
so
and
so
is
too
strict
with
the
union;
get
rid
of
him.
it's
virtually
impossible
that
they
believed
that
this
section
dealt
with
the
situation
we
have
here
where
there
is
no
bargaining
relationship
whatsoever.
in
a
different
setting
this
court
seemed
to
accept
the
limited
scope
of
8(b)(1)(b)
and
that
was
in
the
1981
case
of
labor
board
versus
amax
coal
which
dealt
with
the
interplay
between
section
8(b)(1)(b)
and
the
duties
of
trustees
under
section
302
trusts.
the
court's
opinion
there,
which
reflected
the
views
of
eight
justices,
described
congress's
intent
under
8(b)(1)(b)
as
preventing
unions
from
forcing
employers
to
join
multi-employer
units
or
to
dictate
the
identity
of
those
who
would
represent
employers,
"et
cetera,
and
we
did
not
read
justice
stevens'
dissent
to
take
issue
with
that
aspect
of
the
majority
opinion.
"
the
board's
decision
here
clearly
goes
beyond
oakland
mailers
on
which
abc
rests,
and
we
think
past
the
breaking
point.
it
is
important
to
recall
that
in
oakland
mailers
the
board
focused
on
the
right
of
an
employer
to
have
"control
over
its
representatives"
and
it
noted
with
particularity,
and
i
quote
again,
"the
underlying
question
was
the
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
parties.
"
there
can't
be
any
such
question,
and
no
issue
of
divided
loyalties
here
because
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
relationship.
returning
briefly
to
anomalies,
another
that
we
see
here
is
that
the
board's
decision
would
grant
supervisors
a
preferred
status
in
unions
because
only
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
membership
without
being
held
accountable
for
breaching
the
duties
of
union
rules.
but
that's
exactly...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
all
supervisors
who
are
members
of
the
union.
they
would
be
free
from
the
strictures
of
the
union
rules.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
i
will
accept
that
because
to
explain
it
more
fully
would
probably
take
an
hour.
the
board
doesn't
really
new
to
that
line.
the
board
has
developed
something
which
it
calls
a
reservoir
doctrine
in
which,
basically
it
says,
totally
without
warrant,
i
think,
that
any
supervisor
is
an
8(b)(1)(b)
supervisor
because
he
is
in
that
group
from
which
grievance
adjustors
and
bargaining
representatives
are
naturally
to
be
drawn.
so,
while
i
agree
with
you,
there
should
be
such
a
distinction,
i
do
not
read
the
board
cases
as
having
a
real
distinction.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
frankly,
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
case,
although
when
i
say
that
i
have
to
recognize
that
i
have
abc
standing
in
front
of
us.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
however,
with
this
particular
provision
for
20
years
it
interpreted
it
in
a
narrow
manner
which
was
faithful
to
congressional
intent
and
legislative
history,
until
the
oakland
mailers
case
in
'68.
that
is
when
it
started
its
broadening
of
the
scope
of
8(b)(1)(b).
it
finally
culminated
before
this
court
in
abc
in
which
the
court,
and
i'll
use
the
phrase,
said
that
the
board...
there
were
intimations
both
in
florida
power
and
in
abc
that
the
board
had
stretched
it
pretty
far.
in
florida
power
the
stretching
was
not
permitted
because
it
had
to
do
with
supervisors
performing
rank-and-file
work
behind
a
picket
line.
in
abc
it
was
countenanced,
but
with
the
caveat,
as
i
have
mentioned,
that
the
court
said,
you
have
reached
the
outer
boundaries
and
we
think,
given
the
lack
of
any
relationship
between
the
union
and
these
two
particular
employers,
that
they
have
certainly
passed
that
boundary
in
this
case.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
yes.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
no.
it
is
not,
your
honor,
and
it
is
one
of
those
things
that,
when
you
prepare
for
your
oral
argument
you
see
something
you
wish
you
had
put
in
the
brief.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
let
me
give
you
the
citation
for
it.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
it's
453
u.s.
322,
and
the
quote
i
read
is
at
page
335.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
of
the
rather
strange
things
about
the
board
decision
here,
is
that
it
appears
to
us
to
fly
in
the
face
of
a
much
earlier
board
decision
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
as
has
the
board:
national
association
of
letter
carriers.
that
was
decided
after
abc,
and
it
cited
abc,
and
the
board
there
held
that
a
union
rule
that
denied
membership
status
to
persons
who
accepted
jobs
as
temporary
supervisors
was
not
unlawful
which
is,
i
think,
essentially
what
we
have
here.
the
board's
reasoning
is
quite
similar
to
our
argument
in
our
brief.
this
is
a
quote.
this
is
from
footnote
29
at
the
board's
decision.
"the
fact
that
the
postal
service
may
have
fewer
letter
carriers
who
are
willing
to
serve
as
temporary
supervisors
as
a
result
of
the
amendment
to
the
union's
constitution
in
no
way
affects
the
postal
service's
selection
of
which.
"
--that's
the
board's
emphasis...
"of
which
letter
carriers
will
serve
as--
"
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
--the
board
does
concede
that.
but
what
the
board--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
no,
the
case
we
are
talking
about
is
where
the
union
stripped
membership
rights
from
those
people--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
--they
denied...
there
were
two
issues
in
the
case.
first,
denial
of
membership.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
no...
all
right.
let
me
back
up.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
the
union
dealt
with
the
postal
service.
it
has
as
its
members
the
employee
of
the
postal
service.
it
imposed
a
new
rule
in
its
constitution
that
said,
you
members,
you
employees
of
the
postal
service
may
not
become
temporary
supervisors.
if
you
do,
you
lose
your
membership
and
you
lose
your
benefits
under
that
membership.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
already
members,
as
with
us,
banned
from
taking
jobs
as
supervisors,
as
our
rule
does
with
respect
to
those
employers
who
are
adverse
to
our
interests
by
having
lower
wage
standards.
we
see
no
principal
distinction
between
the
two
rules,
that
of
letter
carriers
and
that
here,
or
their
effects.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
ninth
circuit's
denial
of
enforcement
to
the
board's
order.
