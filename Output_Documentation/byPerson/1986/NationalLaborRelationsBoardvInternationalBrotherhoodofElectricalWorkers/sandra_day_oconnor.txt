mr.
ganzfried,
section
8(b)(1)(a)--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--saves
out
a
union's
right
to
impose
discipline
on
its
members,
and
you
read
this
subsection
(b)
as
an
exception
to
that,
some
way?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
mr.
ganzfried,
if
there
is
no
ongoing
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
relationship
between
the
employer
and
the
union,
how
is
the
employer
threatened
in
the
integrity
at
the
grievance
adjustment
bargaining
process
by
this
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
he
doesn't
have
any
relationship
with
this
union
at
all,
then.
it's
just--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
i
am
suggesting
is,
maybe
there
is
some
sense
in
requiring
a
representational
nexus.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
sounds
like
you
are
arguing,
there
is
in
fact
a
representational
nexus
here,
rather
than
arguing
that
a
representational
nexus
is
not
what
we
ought
to
hang
the
decision
on.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cohen,
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
in
note
37
in
abc
case,
which
deals
with
the
discipline
of
supervisors
not
involved
in
bargaining
or
grievance
adjustment
with
the
union?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
language
could
be
read
more
broadly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
it
make
a
difference
that
the
union
is
trying
to
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
forcing
this
employer
into
the
multi-employer--
