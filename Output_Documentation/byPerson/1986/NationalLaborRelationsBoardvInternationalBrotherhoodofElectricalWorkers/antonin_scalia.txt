preservation
of
it
by
providing
him
with
a
larger
pool
of
people
from
among
whom
to
select?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
he
being
coerced?
he
is
not...
it's
not
that
he's
made
a
selection
and
that's...
and
somehow
he
is
directly
being
coerced
to
change
that
selection;
it's
just
that
the
union
is
saying
to
its
members
generally,
you
won't
be
in
the
pool
that
the
employer
can
select
from.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
crucial,
that
they
already
had
the
jobs
as
supervisors?
it
would
be
a
violation
just
as
much
for
an
agency
simply
to
say,
nobody
who
is
a
union
member
can
apply
for
a
job
as
a
supervisor.
wouldn't
that
be
a
violation
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
please
don't
tell
me
that's
not
this
case.
i
know
it's
not
this
case.
but
wouldn't
that
be
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
be
sure.
i
am
asking
you
whether,
under
the
board's
theory,
it
would
constitute
restraint
or
coercion
of
the
employer,
simply
to
tell
your
union
members,
we
don't
want
you
working
for
this
type
of
an
employer
in
any
job,
including
as
a
supervisory
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
not
precatory.
you'll
be
punished
if
you
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
coercing
the
employer
by
limiting
the
pool
from
which
he
can
select.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
mild
form
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
a
strict
reading
of
the
statute;
that
is
what
you
are
urging
on
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
want
to
interpret
the
statute
strictly,
i
don't
know
that
the
employer
is
being
coerced
here.
doesn't
it
strike
you
as
strange
that
we
have...
that
congress
would
create
a
system
in
which
a
union
can
say
to
its
members,
you
can't
work
for
this
employer
but
you
can,
of
course,
become
a
supervisor
and
bargain
for
that
employer.
that's
a
very
strange
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
the
situation
we
have,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
threats
or
coercion.
it's
a
union
rule.
that's
a
very
common
union
rule,
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
a
very
common
one,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
they
are
in,
certainly.
and
what
if
they
have
sort
of
been...
but
before
they're
in
it's
okay
so
long
as
they
haven't
been
made
a
supervisor
with
bargaining
responsibility
yet,
the
union
rule
could
be
applied
and
they
could
be
fined,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i've
got--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i
presume
we
have
middle
situations
somewhere,
where
they
don't
have
the
job
yet
but
they
have
been
offered
the
job
by
the
employer
and
then
the
union
chooses
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
the
union
says,
you
are...
just
by
working
for
this
employer,
which
is
what
was
the
case
here.
the
union
didn't
discipline
these
people
for
taking
the
bargaining
jobs.
they
disciplined
then
for
violating
the
union
rule
against
working
as
an
employee,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
they
would
not
have
been
dismissed
had
they
not
had
supervisory
bargaining
responsibilities?
they
wouldn't
have
been
fined
by
the
union?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
union
rule
was
a
general
rule
that
you
don't
work
for
a
non-union
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
were
there
any
other
union
members
who
are
working
for
this
employer
who
were
not
supervisors?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
that
rule
happens
to
apply
to
somebody
who
is
doing
bargaining--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
he,
in
effect,
he
immunizes
himself
from
that
rule
by
accepting
a
supervisory
job
with
bargaining
responsibilities?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't
just
supervisor.
it
isn't
going
from
supervisor
to
employee.
it
has
to
be
a
supervisor
who
has
bargaining
responsibilities,
grievance
responsibilities,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
generally
a
distinctive
character.
you
don't
go
in
and
out
of
that
from
job
to
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
these
functions?
justice
antonin
scalia
otherwise,
though--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
have
said
otherwise.
i
mean,
we
have
fallen
into
that
hole
already,
if
you
consider
it
a
hole.
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
decision,
if
it
stands,
that
is
an
anomaly
of
abc
if
it
stands,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
supervisors?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
i
don't
know
the
business
well
enough,
but
i
thought
it's
just
supervisors
who
have
bargaining
or
grievance
responsibilities.
is
that
almost
always
all
supervisors?
justice
antonin
scalia
labor
board
versus
amax?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
tell
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
