justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
i'm
not
sure
i
remember
your
answer
to
the
earlier
question.
as
i
understand
it,
the
discipline
here
was
not
because
he's
a
supervisor
but
rather
because
he
was
an
employee
of
a
company
with
which
the
union
had
no
relationship?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wasn't
critical
that
he
was
a
supervisor,
from
the
union's
rationale
for
imposing
the
discipline?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
it's
the
question
that
i
think
the
chief
justice
asked
you
this
and
i'm
not
sure
i
got
the
answer,
supposing
he
had
not
been
a
supervisor
but
merely
among
a
group
of
employees
who
was
eligible
for
promotion
at
some
future
date,
and
they
in
effect
said,
you
can't
work
for
that
employer;
well
fine
you
if
you
do.
would
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not?
now,
what's
the
difference?
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand,
why--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
the
section
says,
"in
the
selection
of".
it
doesn't
use
the
word
"selection"
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
wouldn't
that
affect
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would
affect
the
pool
from
which
the
employer
could
make
its
selection.
i'm
not
quite
clear
why
that's
different,
because
both
cases
reduce
the
pool
from
which
the
employer
can
make
the
selection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it
isn't
a
matter
of
selection,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
supervisor
with
bargaining
functions--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
the
converse
of
justice
white's
question,
i
take
it
from
your
position
that
the
union
could
not
have
expelled
him
from
the
union
either,
because
that
would
have
been
a
form
of
discipline
and
he
might
have
lost
some
pension
benefits
and
the
like?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
discipline?
just
say,
they
use
that
as--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
would
equally
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
am
i
right,
that
would
equally
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
