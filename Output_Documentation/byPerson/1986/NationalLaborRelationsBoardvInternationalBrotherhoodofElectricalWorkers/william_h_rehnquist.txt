chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
afternoon
in
85-1924,
national
labor
relations
board
versus
ibew.
mr.
ganzfried,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
deep
does
this
go,
mr.
ganzfried?
could
a
union
violate
this
section
by
disciplining
simply
a
run
of
the
mine
member,
an
employee?
if
the
employer
says,
well,
i
was
thinking
about
maybe
picking
him
for
a
supervisor
sometime--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so,
working
for
an
employer
as
a
journeyman,
the
union
may
discipline;
working
for
an
employer
as
a
supervisor,
a
union
may
not
discipline?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
board's
position
is
that
they
can
do
that
with
respect
to
normal
employees
but
they
cannot
do
that
with
respect
to
supervisors?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
board's
reasoning,
at
least
in
part,
that
in
something
like
the
construction
industry
a
fellow
may
be
a
supervisor
on
one
job
and
a
journeyman
or
ordinary
laborer
on
the
next,
and
so
he
is
really
giving
up
livelihood
if
he
leaves
the
union?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ganzfried.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
a
hiring
hall
in
the
construction
industry
must
refer
a
non-union
member
on
equally
as
favorable
a
basis
as
a
union
member?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
advantage
of
belonging
to
a
union,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
the
free
riders
or
the
non-union
get
the
same
thing--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
there
have
been
some
distinction
between
supervisors
and
run-of-the-mine
people
under
the
taft-ellender
colloquy?
i
mean,
there
were
a
few
people,
certainly,
that
the
union
could
not
discipline.
or
do
you
think
that
taft
and
ellender
thought
that
union
discipline
was
not
the
method
by
which
the
employer
would
be
coerced?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
also
have
a
statute
which,
the
board
has
always
had
power
to,
you
know,
interpret
in
a
fairly
substantive
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
the
case
is
submitted.
