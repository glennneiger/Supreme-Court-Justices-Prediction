mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
question
of
statutory
construction
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
board
concluded
that
the
respondent
union
violated
section
8(b)(1)(b)
which
prohibits
a
union
from
restraining
or
coercing
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representatives
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances.
the
ninth
circuit
denied
enforcement
to
that
order
even
though
it
acknowledged
that
the
union's
action
may
constitute
prohibited
conduct.
in
our
view,
that
recognition
by
the
court
should
have
ended
the
case
and
the
board's
order
should
have
been
enforced.
instead,
in
reliance
on
a
theory
that
was
entirely
of
its
own
creation,
a
theory
that
even
the
respondent
now
disavows,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
act.
it
then
compounded
that
error
by
rejecting
the
board's
findings
of
fact
that
would
have
required
enforcement
even
under
that
court's
legal
theory.
after
briefly
reviewing
the
facts,
i
will
like
to
explain
why
the
board's
interpretation
of
8(b)(1)(b)
is
reasonable
and
should
be
upheld,
and
i
would
also
like
to
explain
why
the
various
limitations
on
section
8(b)(1)(b)
advanced
in
the
theories
of
the
district
court
and
by
respondent
should
be
rejected.
this
case
arose
out
of
a
dispute
between
the
respondent
union
and
numerous
electrical
contractors
in
the
sacramento,
california
area
involving
the
composition
of
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit.
for
some
40
years
the
respondent
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
sacramento
chapter
of
the
national
electrical
contractors
association
or
nica,
as
it
is
called,
which
is
an
organization
that
represented
some
55
employers
in
the
industry,
in
negotiating
and
administering
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
last
of
those
agreements
expired
on
may
31st,
1981,
and
two
weeks
later
the
union
struck
all
nica
members.
the
strike
continued
for
some
three
months
until
september
15,
1981,
when
the
union
sent
a
disclaimer
of
interest
in
representing
the
employees
of
the
association's
members
in
the
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
previously
established.
the
union
did
not,
however,
disclaim
interest
in
representing
the
employees
of
nica
members
in
a
different
bargaining
unit
or
in
single
employer
bargaining
units.
rather,
it
filed
separate
petitions
seeking
to
represent
in
single
employer
units
the
employees
of
some
17
nica
members,
and
as
respondent's
official
testified
in
this
case,
the
union's
strategy
was
that,
"ultimately,
down
the
road,
it
was
our
hope
that
everybody
would
be
back
under
an
agreement.
"
nica,
however,
signed
a
bargaining
agreement
with
a
different
union,
the
national
association
of
independent
unions,
or
naiu,
and
the
two
employers
involved
in
this
case,
the
royal
electric
company
and
harold
e.
nutter,
incorporated,
adopted
that
new
agreement.
some
months
later
respondent
restrained
and
coerced
those
two
employers
in
the
selection
of
their
8(b)(1)(b)
representatives.
internal
union
charges
were
brought
against
union
members
employed
as
supervisors
by
royal
and
nutter.
those
charges
were
brought
under
provisions
of
the
union
constitution
that
subject
a
member
to
penalties
for
"causing
economic
harm
to
other
union
members.
"
and
for
"working
for
an
employer
whose
position
is
adverse
or
detrimental
to
the
union.
"
two
supervisors
were
found
guilty
of
those
charges
and
fined
$6,000
and
28,200
respectively.
the
national
labor
relations
board
found
that
the
union's
conduct
coerced
the
disfavored
employers
in
the
selection
of
their
representatives
for
section
8(b)(1)(b)
purposes,
and
therefore
that
the
imposition
of
those
fines
constituted
an
unfair
labor
practice.
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
board
applied
the
test
that
this
court
set
forth
both
in
florida
power
and
in
abc
versus
writers
guild;
namely,
whether
the
union's
action
may
adversely
affect
the
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representatives.
section
8(b)(1)(b)
was
designed
to
preserve
an
employer's
unfettered
right
to
select
supervisory
personnel
for
two
specific
functions:
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining.
the
section
preserves
that
employer
right
by
removing
from
the
arsenal
of
labor
unions
a
particular
economic
weapon.
that
weapon
is
the
union's
ability
to
restrain
or
coerce
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
its
representatives
for
the
two
stated
functions.
just
as
the
statutory
language
focuses
on
the
restraint
an
the
employer,
the
board
and
this
court
have
focused
on
the
potential
impact
of
union
conduct
on
employers.
specifically,
in
abc
versus
writers
guild,
the
court
described
how
such
union
discipline
as
we
have
here
can
restrain
an
employer's
exercise
of
rights
preserved
under
that
section.
such
discipline,
the
court
said,
may
adversely
affect
a
supervisor's
willingness
to
perform
grievance
adjustment
or
collective
bargaining
duties,
that
is,
his
willingness
to
serve
in
that
capacity
in
the
first
place,
or
the
discipline
may
affect
the
manner
in
which
the
supervisor
performs
those
tasks.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
abc...
the
fines
in
abc
arose
in
the
midst
of
a
strike,
that's
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
there
had
been
a
strike.
the
strike
had
ended
by
the
time
the
fines
were
imposed
here.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
yes.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
the
proviso
in
subsection
(a)
is
not
part
of
subsection
(b).
it
does
not
qualify
subsection
(b).
i
might
add
that
even
with
that
proviso
in
mind,
the
union's
right
to
enforce
its
own
rules
ends
when
the
enforcement
of
those
rules
impairs
a
statutory
labor
policy,
and
here
the
enforcement
of
a
rule
impairs
the
statutory
labor
policy
set
forth
in
8(b)(1)(b),
namely
the
preservation
of
the
employer's
right
to
select
his
representatives.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
specifically
protecting
him
from
restraint
or
coercion
in
making
his
selection.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
this
case
is
not
to
present
a
question
of
a
pool.
in
this
case
we
have
two
employers
who
have
selected
two
representatives,
mr.
choate
and
mr.
schoux,
and
the
union
stepped
in
and
said
mr.
schoux...
in
effect
mr.
schoux
and
mr.
choate
must
go.
they
effected
that
by
imposing
fines
on
mr.
schoux
and
mr.
choate,
substantial
fines
that
clearly
would
have
the
effect
of
compelling
them
to
leave
their
employment.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
could
well
be.
the
point
i
am
making--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--if
what
the
union
did
constituted
restraint
or
coercion.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
the
absence
of
any...
simply
a
statement,
a
precatory
statement
by
the
union--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--then
it
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
abc
the
court
referred
to
two
potential
effects.
that
is--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
this
court
did
say
in
abc
that
either
of
the
two
effects
that
i
described,
that
is,
the
willingness
to
serve
or
the
manner
in
which
the
supervisor
performs
his
functions,
constitutes
restraint
and
coercion
under
the
act.
in
this
case
there
is
not
dispute
that
the
supervisor
members,
mr.
choate
and
mr.
schoux,
were
representatives
of
their
employers
for
the
purposes
stated
in
section
8(b)(1)(b),
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
board
that
the
union's
conduct
could
have
the
effect
on
the
employers
that
the
section
was
designed
to
prevent.
after
all,
$6,000
and
$8,000
fines
are
mighty
coercive.
and
the
parties
in
this
case
don't
dispute
that
conclusion,
although
there
is
suggestion
in
the
amicus
brief
by
the
afl-cio
that
union
discipline
can
never
violate
the
section.
that
is
a
suggestion
that
would
overturn
two
decades
of
jurisprudence
under
the
act,
and
it
would
require
this
court
to
overrule
its
holding
in
abc.
ultimately,
that's
a
suggestion
that
should
go
to
congress,
and
i
would
note
that
congress
has
expressed
no
displeasure
with
the
board's
long-settled
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
we
are
presenting
here.
it
is
our
submission
that
when
it
has
been
determined
that
the
disciplined
employees
fit
within
the
terms
of
8(b)(1)(b)
and
the
union
conduct
may
deprive
the
employer
of
that
supervisor's
services,
then
the
inquiry
is
at
an
end
and
the
violation
has
been
established.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
the
union
disciplines
him
for
working
for...
the
union
may
be
free
to
discipline
a
journeyman
for
working
for
a
particular
employer,
a
non-union
employer.
it
can't
discipline
someone
because
that
person
serves
as
a
supervisor
for
such
an
employer.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
right.
this
section
reaches
the...
takes
that
economic
weapon
out
of
the
union's
hands
in
the
context
of
supervisors
performing
the
8(b)(1)(b)
function.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
is
restrained
in
his
selection
of
the
person
he
will
have
performing
that
function,
and
that
is
what
the
statute
protects.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
may
not
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
union.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
one
answer
to
that
is,
well,
in
fact
there
is
an
adversity
relationship
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
that
is,
the
union
disciplined
these
people
because
they
worked
for
employers
whose
positions
were
adverse
and
detrimental
to
the
union.
the
adversity
is
established
by
the
basis
for
the
union's
discipline.
in
fact,
this
dispute
arose
in
a
context
that
is
very
similar
to
the
kinds
of
industrial
contexts
that
congress
was
considering
when
it
passed
this
section;
namely,
a
dispute
as
to
what
will
constitute
the...
who
will
be
a
member
of
the
multi-employer
bargaining
unit.
it
was
an
ongoing
struggle.
while
the
strike
that
had
started--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
there
is
a
representational
nexus
here
and
in
fact
the
board
found
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it
is
not
necessary
to
our
view
of
a
section,
because,
for
the
reasons
the
union
points
out
in
its
brief,
in
order
for
a
union
to
fulfill
its
purposes,
one
necessary
goal
is
to
represent
as
many
as
possible,
if
possible,
all
of
the
employees
in
an
industry
in
a
geographic
area.
in
this
context,
the
unions
and
the
employers
will
be
in
an
adverse
relationship.
now,
it's
not
necessary
to
define
the
nature
of
that
adversity
as
being
representational
or
something
else.
a
union
could,
without
any
representational
nexus
or
without
any
present
representational
intent,
decide
that
company
"a"
has
a
foreman
that
a
lot
of
the
employees
don't
like.
company
"a"
is
nonunion,
and
the
union,
without
representing
the
employees,
just
pickets
or
makes
threats
aimed
at
having
foreman
"a"
out.
now,
it
may
turn
out
that
as
a
result
of
that,
the
employees
out
of
gratitude
may
turn
to
the
union.
the
point
is,
the
employer's
right
to
select
his
representative
has
been
restrained
and
that's
the
way
the
statute
was
written.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
with
another
union?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
as
in
abc,
the
grievance--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--if
the
supervisor
in
the
non-union...
and
by
that
i
mean
no
union
employer
performs
the
functions
described
in
that
section,
grievance
adjustment,
and
the
union
imposes
that--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--that's
right,
as
long
as
the
supervisor
is
performing
the
designated
functions.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
then
they
are
not
covered.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
they
are
fined
for
performing
other
functions.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no.
it
may
make
this
case,
perhaps,
an
easier
case
but
it's
not
essential
to
our
theory
of
the
case.
the
employer's
right
has
been
restrained,
and
that
is
what
the
statute
speaks
to.
the
statute
doesn't
have
in
it
a
limitation
that
this
can
occur
only
with
respect
to
employers
who
have
a
collective
bargaining
relationship--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
conduct
here
comes
within
the
language
of
the
statute
and
that's
the
way
the
board
has
interpreted
it,
and
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
what
congress
is
doing--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it's
taking
union
interference...
it's
protecting
the
employer
from
union
interference
with
the
supervisors
who
are
coming...
who
are
in
interface
with
journeyman,
rank
and
file,
the
subordinate
employees.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
discipline
was
because
he
was
working
for
an
employer
who
was
adverse
and
detrimental...
whose
position
was
adverse
and
detrimental.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
we
don't
inquire
into
that
particular
rationale.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
our
position
on
that
is
that
it
wouldn't.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
difference
is
that
the
statute
protects
the
employer
from
having
the
union
come
in
and
say,
we
don't
like
foreman
smith.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
yes.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
the
selection
of--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--in
both
cases
it
reduced
the
pool.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
right.
now,
if
we're
going
to--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
it
is
the
selection.
he's
been
selected
and
he's
out.
that
is
clear
and
direct
restraint.
i
think
we
are
now
talking
about
a
hypothetical
in
which
the
union
has,
by
threats
or
coercion
of
some
sort,
indicated
that
it
doesn't
want
its
members
working
for
nutter
or
royal
at
all.
to
the
extent
that
that--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it's
a
union
rule.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
and
it's
enforceable
with
respect
to
non-8(b)(1)(b)
supervisors.
but
congress
has
taken
that
particular
weapon
of
imposing
a
restraint
with
respect
to
those
supervisors,
out
of
the
union's
hands.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
they
are
fined
simply
for
working
for
a
non-union
employer
and
the
work
that
they
do
is
journeyman
work--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--and
it's
not
an
8(b)(1)(b)
situation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
and
the
union
comes
along
and
says,
don't
take
the
job?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
for
working
for
someone
whose
position
is
adverse
and
detrimental
to
the
union,
and
for
causing
economic
harm
to
union
members.
that
was
the
stated
basis
for
the
union
discipline.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
perhaps
the
union
would
have
fined
them,
perhaps
not.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
union
rule
in
terms
is
even
more
general
than
that.
you
don't
work
for
anyone
who
is
adverse
and
detrimental
to
the
union.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
the
earlier
stages
of
this
case,
there
was
another
employee,
mr.
miller,
and
he
is
discussed
in
the
administrative
law
judge's
decision.
it
was
determined
that
he
was
a
supervisor,
but
at
the
job
site
for
which
he
was
being
disciplined,
he
was
not
working
as
a
supervisor.
he
was
working
as
a
journeyman
and
it
was
found
that
that
did
not
violate
8(b)(1)(b).
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
don't
know
that
the
record
indicates.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
but
they
selected
particular
employers
as
the
disfavored
employers.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
they
can
have
a
rule
that
says
you
can
only
work
for
employers
that
have
a
contract
with
this
union.
if
they
want--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--when
they
seek
to
enforce
that
rule
against
someone
who
is
in
an
8(b)(1)(b)
capacity,
it's
a
violation
of
8(b)(1)(b).
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
he...
the
employer
is
entitled
to
the
protection.
the
other
way,
looking
at
it
from
the
other
side--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--has
it
explained
why
that--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
employee
could.
it
doesn't
undo
the
violation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
when
he
takes
the
job
he
quits
the
union?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
union
has
no
ability
to
discipline
him
any
more.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
now,
if
it
tries
to
restrain
or
coerce
him
in
some
other
way--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--to
allow
him
to
quit,
for
the
union
to
say,
because
he
can
quit
we
can't
coerce
him?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
it's
an
argument
that
the
court
expressly
rejected
in
the
abc
versus
writers
guild
case.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
may
well.
there
may
well
be
additional
benefits
that
continue...
like
mr.
miller,
exactly.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
in
some
industries
you
do,
and
as
the
record
shows
with
respect
to
mr.
miller
in
this
case
he
did.
on
one
job
site
he
was
not
a
supervisor
and
on
another
one
he
was.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
supervisor
with
bargaining
functions,
and--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--yes,
and
he
was
found
to
perform
these
functions
on
one
job
site.
it
was
not
the
job
site
for
which
he
was
subject
to
the
discipline
on
the
job
site,
and
when
he
was
disciplined
he
was
found
to
be
working
as
a
journeyman.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
there
have
been
cases
in
which
the
board
has
found
that
expelling
a
member
for--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--they
expel
him--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--that's
right.
the
board
has
found
that.
our
brief
explains
why
the
various
limitations
that
the
court
wanted
to
import
into
the
statute,
namely
the
representational
intent,
our
brief
indicates
why
that
should
be
rejected
as
it
does
the
limitation
that
the
union
in
this
case
wants
to
bring
into
the
statute,
namely
that
it
should
be
limited
only
to
a
union
trying
to
influence
the
way
a
supervisor
performs
his
functions
but
it
shouldn't
cover
a
union
trying
to
prevent
a
person
from
taking
that
position
in
the
first
place
or
of
forcing
him
out
of
a
position
that
he
has
already
taken.
i
don't
want
to
repeat
what
we
had
in
the
brief.
what
i
do
want
to
say,
though,
is
that
when
all
is
said
and
come
in
the
case,
the
fact
remains
that
the
board
has
not
done
anything
new
here,
that
it
hasn't
been
doing
in
interpreting
this
section,
for
20
years.
this
case
is
in
all
material
respects
identical
to
the
a.
s.
horner
case
decided
by
the
board
in
1968,
enforced
by
the
tenth
circuit
in
1972,
and
noted
by
this
court
in
abc
versus
writers
guild
as
failing
close
to
the
original
rationale
of
section
8(b)(1)(b)
which
was
to
permit
the
employer
to
keep
the
bargaining
representative
of
his
own
choosing.
