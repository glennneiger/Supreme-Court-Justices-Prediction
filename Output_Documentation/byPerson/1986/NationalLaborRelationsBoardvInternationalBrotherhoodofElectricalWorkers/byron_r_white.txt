but
the
representative
would
be
doing
the
employer's
work
with
another
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron

white
suppose
there
were
two
employers
here.
one,
after
this
reorganization,
one
of
the
employers
in
the
unit
didn't
sign
the
agreement;
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
wasn't
represented
by
the
union
at
all.
and
the
other
employer
was
the
employer
in
this
case,
and
the
union
fined
supervisors
in
both
companies.
the
only
thing
is
that
the
supervisors
in
the
one
company
had
no
representational
function
whatsoever.
i
suppose
the
union
could
make
them
quit,
just
like
they
could
make
non-supervisors
quit.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
is
a
union
involved
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
supervisors
who
don't.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
the
representational
activities
involved
here
are
between
the...
and
respecting
another
union,
a
different
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
one
case
it
insists
that
somebody
who
has
been
selected
be
removed.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
any
members
that
the
union
didn't
discipline
that
were
working
for
that
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
they
just
didn't
select
out
supervisors
to
discipline?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
the
board
ever
explained
or
said
why
shouldn't...
why
the...
if
the
employee
doesn't
like
it
he
can
get
out
of
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
the
employee
just
get
out
of
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
when
he
takes
the
job,
he
quits
the
unions.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
right.
why
should
that
be
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
shouldn't
that
be
a
resolution
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.
say
that
the
union
can
coerce
him
as
long
as
he
insists
on
being
a
supervisor
and
a
member
of
the
union
at
the
same
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
can
charge
them
for
your
services.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
here
was
saying
that
the
union
could
discipline
any
of
its
members
who
are
not
supervisors
if
they
insisted
on
working
for
this
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
this
case--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's
the
case
you
are
talking
about,
almost.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
stripped
the
membership
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
entry?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
already
members?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
people
are
already
members?
