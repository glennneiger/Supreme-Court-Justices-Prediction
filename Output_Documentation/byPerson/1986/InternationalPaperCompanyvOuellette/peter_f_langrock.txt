mr.
peter
f.
langrock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
what
we
have
here
is
a
private
nuisance
action
brought
by
citizens
of
the
state
of
vermont
against
a
new
york
corporation
which
was
removed
from
vermont
courts
to
the
federal
court
based
on
diversity
of
jurisdiction.
we
are
seeking
compensatory
damages
for
actual
damages
done
to
property
owned
by
my
clients.
we
are
seeking
punitive
damages
and
we
are
seeking
injunctive
relief
if
under
usual
theories
of
equity
jurisprudence
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate.
we
are
suggesting
to
this
court
that
vermont
law
in
the
vermont
courts
or
the
vermont
federal
court
in
this
case
is
appropriate.
in
full
candor
the
solicitor's
position
is
such
that
they
ask
for
a
division
in
effect,
of
vermont
law
and
new
york
law
based
upon
the
compensatory
versus
punitive
injunctive
relief.
we
don't
think
that
will
make
any
difference
in
our
case.
as
far
as
we
know
vermont
law
and
new
york
law
are
identical
on
the
question
of
private
nuisance,
in
effect
that
unless
this
court
holds
that
we
are
cut
off
from
all
remedies,
the
damages
done
to
our
properties,
that
the
position
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
the
reason
that
we
think
vermont
law
applies
is,
first
of
all,
under
traditional
choice
of
law
provisions.
we
think
the
act
preserves
it.
there
are
the
saving
clauses
1370
and
1365(e).
there
is
the
legislative
history.
we
don't
read
the
milwaukee
cases
as
changing
that,
and
we
think
whatever
analysis
of
federal
preemption,
either
express
or
implied,
by
the
petitioner
is
incorrect.
what
i
would
like
to
do
first
is
talk
about
the
saving
clause
itself
and
the
legislative
history.
quite
clearly
the
legislative
history
says
that
a
private
damages,
private
action
damages
is
to
be
preserved.
i
think
one
of
the
questions--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--excuse
me?
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
we
are
saying
whatever
existed
at
common
law
or
statutory
state.
and
we
have
to
go
with
whatever
was
existing.
and
certainly
the
private
nuisance
going
back
to
tennessee...
georgia
versus
tennessee
copper
was
recognized
in
interstate
pollution
type
cases.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
milwaukee
i
said,
if
i
understand
the
way
the
holding
of
that
was
set
forth
in
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
milwaukee
ii,
was
that
a
state
could
no
longer
depend
on
federal
common
law,
or
that
held
a
state
had
to
go
to
federal
common
law
to
abate
a
nuisance,
and
that
was
the
only
holding.
and
when
the
federal
clean
water
act
came
along,
then
milwaukee
ii
came
down.
milwaukee
ii
says
you
have
a
minimum
standard
that
is
set
by
congress,
and
we
are
not
going
to
create
in
the
federal
courts
a
superlegislature
to
impose
a
higher
minimum
standard.
but
it
certainly
did
nothing
to
displace
any
other
existing
state
law
that
we
can
see,
either
expressly
or
by
federal
preemption.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
either...
if
we
are
damaged
under
a
nuisance
theory
prior
to
milwaukee
i
we
have
an
action,
a
state
court
action.
milwaukee
i
could
be
read
to
say
you
no
longer
have
that,
or
you
can
say
that
was
an
original
jurisdiction
case.
we
are
creating
it
to
deal
with
that
problem
and
we
don't
know
where
that
opinion
would
have
gone
because
six
months
later
we
have
the
federal
law
in
a
narrow
band,
not
a
comprehensive
statute,
really,
but
a
narrow
band
of
problems
comes
and
directly
deals
with
the
problem
of
milwaukee
i.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
no,
you
could
also
say
that
you
have
created
a
whole
federal
common
law
of
private
nuisance.
i
don't
think
that
is
necessary.
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--that
is
correct.
we
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
development.
what
would
have
happened--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--what
would
have
happened,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
had
milwaukee
i
gone
into
its
full
growth
before
the
passage
of
the
act
we
don't
know,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
there
is
no
authority
that
i
know
of
for
cutting
off
our
rights
as
injured
parties.
yet
i
think
looking
at
the
scope
of
the
act
might
be
worthwhile.
this
is
an
act
which
deals
not
with
all
water
pollution
of
navigable
waters.
it
deals
only
with
a
minimum
standard,
a
floor
imposed
upon
the
states.
the
purpose
of
the
act,
it
is
not
a
license
to
allow
pollution,
but
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to,
as
set
forth
in
the
statute
itself,
to
eliminate
all
pollution
by
1985.
and
so
given
that
narrow
network,
that
this
was
such
that
all
milwaukee
ii
did
in
interpreting
milwaukee
i
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
say
federal
courts,
don't
super
impose
your
judgment
on
congress
by
saying
we
are
having
higher
limitations,
but
it
says
nothing
about
all
the
rest
of
that
body
of
law
out
there.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
if
milwaukee
i
is
read
as
creating
all
federal
law
and
replacing
all
state
law,
then
we
loss
on
the
state
law
claim.
if,
however,
at
that
point
we
then
have
a
federal
common
law
claim
to
deal
with
the
type
of
nuisances
we
have,
and
then
we
would
have
to
read
milwaukee
ii
a
little
bit
more
narrowly
and
let
that
go.
if
you
don't
read
them
that
way
what
you
have
done
is
abolished
a
right
of
action,
a
claim
or
property
right
which
is
traditional
in
the
states,
and
there
is
no
intention
that
congress
intended
to
do
that,
and
we
hope
this
court
would
not
intend
to
do
that.
the
federal
preemption
analysis
which
really
i
have
gone
into
here--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--except
for
the
sea
clammers,
your
honor.
we
could
as
individuals,
citizen
suit
or
an
administrator,
go
in
and
try
to
enforce
the
permit.
we
claim
in
our
suit
that
there
are
violations
of
the
permit.
we
claim
that
the
permit
itself
does
not
absolve
us
from
the
injury
we
receive,
and
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
that
type
of
cause
of
action
is
preserved.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
we
don't
have--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--i
don't
think
so,
because
under
sea
clammers
there
is
no
newly
created
right
based
upon
the
federal
statute
or
private
cause
of
action.
all
we
can
do
is
go
in
and
enforce
the
permit.
here
we
are
suggesting
really
it
is
the
traditional
eminent
domain
concept
of
nuisance
law
that
you
have
a
polluter
and
you
have
an
injured
party,
and
the
court
in
its
equity
jurisprudence
has
to
make
a
decision
whether
to
use
injunctive
relief
or
damages
enough
to
pay
for
it.
but
we
don't
let
somebody
pollute
and
damage
this
person
without
some
sort
of
compensation.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
don't
read
it--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--yes,
it
did,
but
we
are
not--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--i
don't
think,
your
honor,
it
reached
the
position
of
a
private
nuisance
case.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
analysis
of
1983
i
think
is
particular
and
peculiar
to
that
case.
i
don't
think
that
that
case
can
be
held
by
analysis
to
cover
all
common
law
state
nuisance
cases.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
what
i
am
saying
is
that
congress--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--congress
did
not
deal
with
1983
or
the
sea
clammers
in
the
legislative
history.
it
quite
clearly
said
in
its
legislative
history
that
this
act
and
the
meaning
of
this
permit
will
not
bar
rights
for
people
who
are
actually
injured.
essential
to
our
case
is
that
we
meet
the
standards,
and
they
are
difficult
standards,
of
a
private
nuisance
under
common
law,
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
vermont,
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
or
in
the
unique
situation
if
we
broadly
read
milwaukee
i
under
a
federal
common
law,
which
i
don't
think
is
necessary
or
the
appropriate
reading
of
that.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
that
would
be...
that
might
be
the
case.
your
honor,
if
that
were
a
license--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--your
honor,
the
federal
standards
put
forth
are
minimum
standards.
the
job
of
this
whole
statute
is
not
to
allow
pollution
but
to
eliminate
it.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
that's
right.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
yes,
it
does.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
it
does
in
the
case,
at
least,
your
honor,
of
a
private
right
of
action,
but
in
any
case
even
if
that...
even
if
new
york
law
applies
we
win.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
that's
right.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
that's
right.
there's
specific
language.
the
regulations
indicate
that
a
permit
does
not
give
you
a
right
to
violate
any
rights
under,
i
think
it
is
122.5.
the
legislative
history
talks
in
terms
of
that,
and
it
is
part
of
looking
at
the
scheme.
this
was
a
scheme
to
start
at
a
base
level
to
eliminate
pollution,
encouraging
the
states
by
their
own
experiments
in
their
own
laboratories
to
go
further.
it
wasn't
to
displace
rights.
it
wasn't
to
take
away
rights
of
people
who
are
being
damaged
by
pollution.
i
mean,
congress
didn't
come
in
and
say
we
want
to
stop
these
plaintiffs
who
have
been
hurt
from
collecting
damages
against
international
paper
company.
that
wasn't
in
there
at
all.
and
so
whatever
state
law
existed
has
to
be
preempted
by
the
court's
own
tests--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--an
injunction?
that
again,
your
honor,
we
think
it
is
appropriate
if
it
meets
the
usual
standards
of
equitable
jurisprudence.
the
case...
there
is
the
boomer
case
in
new
york,
which
says
when
you
have
got
a
cement
plant
with
300
employees
and
you
have
all
these
matters,
we
don't
give
an
injunction
because
we
can
deal
with
damages.
the
furtherance
of
this
act
makes
the
polluter
make
the
choice,
the
economic
choice
of
either
paying
more
to
clean
up
his
plant
if
possible
or
paying
damages
for
the
person--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--i
don't
think
there
is
any
flat
rule.
i
think
that
for
a
private
party
who
is
being
injured...
you
might
take
a
situation
where
there
is
a
very
limited
factual
pattern
where
the
damage
to
that
individual,
even
though
meeting
the
federal
permits,
was
so
great
and
so
outrageous
as
opposed
to
a
very
minor
inconvenience
for
the
polluter
that
the
court
might
grant
that.
it
may
only
be
a
matter
of
a
small
change.
but
in
this
situation
factually
it
would
appear
that
this
comes
closer
to
the
type
of
problem
that
you
had
in
the
situation
in
boomer
where
you
had
a
cement
factory.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
understand
that.
again,
i
want
to
point
out
that
we
can
get
an
injunction
at
whatever
level
under
new
york
law
for
our
particular
case,
but
responding
to
your
question--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
act
which...
if
we
took
away
illinois...
milwaukee
i,
milwaukee
ii,
and
this
act,
where
would
we
be?
we
would
be
having
states
dealing
with
state
common
law
with
regard
to
their
rights.
we
would
have
the
same
type
of
situation
that
we
had
in
georgia
versus
tennessee
copper.
we
have
to
then
look
to
what
displaces
it.
there
is
nothing
that
says
that
the
state
of
new
york
because
it
has
this
minimal
permit
process
has
the
right
to
dump
sewage,
to
dump
pollutants
onto
vermont,
and
here
is
a
perfect
example.
these
are
boundary
waters.
this
pipe
that
dumps
it
out
at
the
lake
is
within
feet,
100
feet,
200
feet,
of
the
vermont
border,
and
to
give
permanent...
to
say
that
new
york
can
pollute
all
it
manes
to
at
some
level
at
the
cost
of
vermont
is
to
give
a
preeminent
position
to
the
polluting
state
rather
than
the
receiving
state.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
act
responds
and
says
we
want
to
stop
pollution.
here
is
a
minimum
for
all.
it
is
stopgap.
he
go
to
the
states.
if
we
are
going
to
replace
the
state
law
that
existed
in
tennessee
copper
where...
there
has
to
be
a
preemption
from
some
reason.
where
does...
this
act
certainly
doesn't
say
we
preempt
it.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
part
of
the
whole
scheme
is
that
me
are
not
going
to
have
anybody
superimpose
a
minimum
level,
raise
the
floor,
whether
it
be
the
federal
courts
or
the
out
of
state,
for
purposes
of
a
permit
process.
this
does
not,
however,
prohibit
the
traditional
common
law
jurisprudence,
in
our
case
nuisance
law,
maybe
even
injunctive
relief,
from
being
applied.
when
we
deal
with
a
state,
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
state
apportionment
as
opposed
to
state
injunctive
relief,
there
may
be--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
--my
reading
of
the
federal
scheme
is
much
narrower
here.
