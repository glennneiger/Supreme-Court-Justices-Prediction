mr.
roy
l.
reardon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
class
action
brought
by
citizens
of
vermont
who
own
property
on
the
vermont
side
of
lake
champlain.
the
state
of
vermont
is
also
a
plaintiff
in
this
case
because
of
its
property
ownership
on
the
same
side.
the
petitioner
here
has
a
paper
mill
on
the
new
york
side
of
lake
chaplain
and
discharges
effluent
into
lake
champlain
in
connection
with
the
manufacture
of
paper.
the
petitioner
is
regulated
by
new
york
state,
which
is
part
of
the
procedure
set
up
under
the
clean
water
act
which
supplements
the
regulation
which
the
act
provides
initially
by
the
epa,
the
federal
epa.
in
this
particular
case
the
permit
is
supervised
in
a
very
detailed
way
and
the
plant
policed
by
the
state
of
new
york.
while
there
is
a
challenge
in
the
case
to
the
manner
in
which
the
petitioner
has
performed
under
the
permit
the
basic
thrust
of
the
lawsuit,
at
least
in
this
phase,
is
a
common
law
claim
of
nuisance.
the
plaintiffs
here,
the
respondents
in
this
court,
seek
compensatory
damages
of
$20
million
and
punitive
damages
of
$100
million.
the
petitioner
moved
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court,
and
basically
the
district
court
held
decision
on
that
motion
pending
the
resolution
of
what
we
refer
to
as
milwaukee
iii,
which
is
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
which
is
referred
to
very
fully
in
the
briefs
of
both
sides.
the
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
petitioner
was
predicated
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
milwaukee
i
and
milwaukee
ii
and
by
reason
of
the
amendments
to
the
clean
water
act
in
1972.
now,
as
the
court
has
very
fully
discussed
in
its
two
opinions
to
which
i
have
referred,
the
act
is
an
extremely
comprehensive
act
which
covers
the
field
with
respect
to
pollution
of
navigable
waters
and
interstate
waters.
there
is
basically
regulation
by
the
federal
government.
the
act
permits
supplementation
of
that
on
more
or
less
a
dual
regulatory
basis
by
the
states
with
the
states
being
able
to
take
over
and
assume
the
regulation
to
the
extent
that
the
state
regulation
equals
or
exceeds
in
terms
of
stringency
what
the
federal
requirements
are.
the
federal
requirements
are
obviously
technical
in
nature,
dealing
with
the
extent
to
which
obvious
discharges
from
manufacturing
facilities
are
permitted
to
be
injected
into
interstate
waters.
there
is
within
the
framework
of
this
act
a
very
careful
balance
between
the
position
of
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
regulation
and
the
position
of
the
source
state,
and
provides
amply
for
source
state
regulation,
indeed
for
the
total
displacement
of
federal
regulation
by
enabling
the
states
to
take
over
to
the
extent
that
their
requirements
meet
or
exceed
the
requirements
of
the
epa.
under
the
permitting
procedure,
to
the
extent
one
does
not
obtain
a
permit
you
are
in
fact
in
violation
of
the
law
and
acting
illegally.
the
permitting
procedure
if
handled
by
the
federal
government
basically
calls
upon
the
epa
to
give
adequate
notice
to
those
states,
including
the
source
state,
which
could
be
affected
by
the
issuance
of
the
permit,
so
everyone
gets
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
within
the
framework
of
federal
regulation.
to
the
extent
the
states
assume
that
role
by
reason
of
their
own
regulations,
equal
to
or
more
stringent
than
those
of
the
federal
government,
similar
notice
is
given
to
affected
states,
non-source
states,
so
that
they
again
may
be
given
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
permitting
procedure.
now,
within
the
framework
of
that
act
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
before
this
court
two
issues.
simply
stated,
the
first
issue
is
the
extent
to
which
vermont
law
can
be
applied
with
respect
to
what
has
happened
here
anti
what
is
involved
here,
and
secondly,
the
extent
to
which
there
may
be
jurisdiction
within
the
vermont
courts
to
hear
the
matter
under
the
provisions
of
the
clean
water
act.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
undertakes
the...
a
state
under
the
act
may
assume
the
role
of
the
authority
which
regulates
the
discharger
in
the
source
state.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
making
its
own
standard
provided
it
is
equal
to
the
federal
standard
or
more
stringent.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
it
is
a
state
permitting
procedure.
it
is
the
basic
part
of
the
clean
water
act
that
the
state
may
do
this
in
terms
of
regulation.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--well,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
challenge
permitted
directly
by
the
act,
that
challenge
can
come
from
a
citizen.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
and
to
that
extent
the
challenge
would
be
based
upon
source
state
law
as
we
see
it
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
well,
there
is
a
very
fundamental
issue
here
with
respect
to
what
law
is
applicable
with
respect
to
the
claims
made
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
we
under...
starting
at
the
beginning
point
of
milwaukee
i,
where
this
court,
we
believe,
concluded
that
interstate
water
pollution
was
a
matter
of
federal
concern
as
to
which
federal
common
law
applied,
and
proceeding
to
milwaukee
ii,
where
the
court
stated,
we
believe
that
federal
common
law
had
been
displaced
by
the
amendments
to
the
clean
water
act,
we
come
now
to
the
conclusion
that
by
reason
of
the
amendments
to
the
clean
mater
act,
indeed,
under
the
specific
provisions
with
respect
to
where
the
suit
should
be
brought,
and
indeed
under
general
preemption
principles,
that
the
law
of
new
york
is
applicable
with
respect
to
discharges
from
a
new
york
source.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
congress--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--within
the
basic
framework
of
the
act,
your
honor,
congress
has
indicated
that--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--we
feel
source
state
law
is
applicable.
in
this
case
new
york.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
well,
it
really
talks
in
terms
of
regulation
as
distinguished
from
making
the
law,
but--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--it
does,
your
honor,
the
technological
standards.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i
do,
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
your
honor.
indeed--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--well,
under
the
general
framework
of
the
statute,
you
may
bring
a
suit
within
the
source
state
either
in
the
state
or
the
federal
court
if
you
are
an
injured
party.
our
position
would
be
that
you
may
bring
such
a
suit.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
no,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
if
it
is
citizens
of
the
same
state
who
are
challenged--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--it
is
really
a
claim
under
the
act,
your
honor,
because
if
you
are
proceeding--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--well,
my
understanding
is
that
the
act
provides
that
you
must
proceed
within
the
district
in
which
the
source
is
located.
now,
i
think
there
can
be
diversity
jurisdiction
within
the
source
state.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
citizens
of
the
same
state
i
would
believe
you
would
be
relegated
to
state
court.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
it
would
not
be
a
federal
jurisdiction-based
issue
at
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
it
would
be
a
challenge
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
compliance
with
the
permit
as
administered
by
the
state.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
we
do.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
under
this
particular
provision
it
is
our
position
that
new
york
law
would
in
fact
apply
rather
than
the
law
of
vermont.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
well,
there
can
be
two
suits,
your
honor.
maybe
i
misunderstood
his
honor's
question.
there
can
be
a
suit
directly
brought
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
under
which
a
governor
or
citizen
may
challenge
compliance
with
a
discharger's
activities
under
the
permit
which
is
issued.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
on
a
federal
jurisdiction
basis.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
now
i
have
given
two
different
answers.
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
i
guess
perhaps
what
i
was
thinking
of
is
the
common
law
nuisance
suit,
which
is
also
part
of
what
is
involved
in
this
case,
and
the
question--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--with
respect
to
the
federal
claim,
with
respect
to
a
violation
of
the
permit.
however,
with
respect
to
a
common
law
claim,
which
is
part
of
what
we
are
dealing
with
here,
we
come
to
the
question
which
is
one
of
the
basic
questions
in
the
case,
the
extent
to
which
vermont
law
can
be
applied
by
reason
of
the
general
scheme
of
the
act
which
suggests
that
law
other
than
the
law
of
the
source
state
has
in
fact
been
preempted,
so
that
you
wind
up
with
a
common
law
nuisance,
as
the
seventh
circuit
in
fact
held,
a
common
law
nuisance
case
could
lie
in
the
state
court
of
new
york
applying
new
york
law,
which
would
or
could
be
a
diversity
case,
and
i
believe
that
may
be
where
i
was
misleading
the
court
in
my
earlier
comments.
the
irony
of
the
situation--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--i
would
think
that
is
possible,
your
honor,
although
i
would
think
in
application
it
would
be
unlikely,
but
i
will
concede
it
is
possible.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
it
could.
the
law
of
nuisance
being
as
vague
as
it
is,
it
is
sort
of
difficult
to
be
sure,
but
i
will
concede
that
for
purposes
of
your
honor's
question.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
that
would
be
a
different
claim
entirely,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
that
is
a
separate
and
distinct
claim,
i
would
expect.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
they
suggest
that
that
action
proceeding
in
vermont
would
look
to
new
york's
choice
of
law
with
respect
to
what
law
would
apply.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
they
do
say
that.
they
limit
that
argument,
however,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it,
with
respect
to
a
claim
for
compensatory
damages,
the
theory
being,
which
is
a
theory
as
to
which
we
do
not
agree,
the
theory
being
that
that
aspect
of
the
claim
would
not
be
regulatory
in
nature,
so
to
that
extent,
unlike
abatement,
and
unlike
punitive
damages,
a
claim
for
compensatory
damages
being
merely
regulatory,
the
binding
effect
of
the
scheme
of
the
act
in
general,
namely,
to
limit
recourse
to
the
source
state
law,
would
not
be
applicable.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i
do,
your
honor.
i
will
do
it
now
if
it
pleases
the
court.
i
fundamentally
see
no
reason
why
there
should
be
the
distinction
which
the
government
makes.
the
statutory
scheme
is
very
clear.
pollution
of
interstate
waters
has
been
held
very
specifically
to
be
a
problem
of
national
dimension
which
the
federal
court
should
address.
the
congress
did
address
it
after
studying
the
matter
for
many
years
and
concluded
that
within
the
framework
of
the
act
the
source
state
and
the
federal
government
would
be
the
partnership
that
would
regulate
in
a
sensible
way
the
control
of
pollution
in
the
navigable
rivers
and
streams
and
interstate
waters
of
the
united
states.
now,
for
a
unique
reason
which
i
do
not
acknowledge
as
being
valid
the
government
here
argues
that
because
it's
compensatory
damages
that
it
should
be
treated
differently,
that
compensatory
damages
do
not
interfere
with
this
overall
regulatory
purpose.
well,
if
i
may--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--my
understanding,
if
your
honor
please,
of
silkwood
is
that
it
represents
a
basic
reconciliation
of
two
separate
federal
laws,
the
first
providing
to
the
nrc
or
the
atomic
energy
commission
or
what
have
you
the
preemption,
the
regulation
of
safety
within
atomic
energy
facilities.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
but
you
must...
at
least
i
feel
i
must
read
that
case,
taking
into
account
that
there
was
a
federal
statute
specifically
dealing
with
this,
to
wit,
price
andersen,
which
i
understood
the
court
to
very
specifically
hinge
its
position
on
and
find
on
the
basis
of
that
that
there
was
a
very
clear
and
distinct
determination
by
congress
that
the
tension
created
by
the
preemption
of
the
safety
issue
in
the
atomic
energy
aspects
had
to
be,
and
congress
had
in
fact
reconciled
it
with
the
equally
compelling
reason
provided
by
statute
and
the
legislative
history
that
there
should
be
private
rights
of
action
under
state
law,
and
that
is
not
present
here.
at
least
i
don't
see
it.
so
that
is
the
distinction,
and
i
think
it
is
a
valid
one
in
terms
of
silkwood.
so
it
is
not
the
same
situation
in
any
respect,
and
i
might
say,
your
honor,
this
whole
question
of
compensatory
damages
is
most
troubling
when
it
comes
in
the
context
of
a
nuisance
situation.
the
government
makes
the
argument
that
compensatory
damages
is
really
economic,
that
it
is
only
incidental.
well,
when
you
are
accused
of
committing
a
nuisance,
particularly
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
the
defendant
has
committed
millions
of
dollars
toward
putting
up
a
plant
and
is
a
discharger
complying
every
day
and
under
the
scrutiny
of
the
state
lay
and
the
state
permitting
authority,
it
is
nonetheless
faced
with
the
possibility
that
it
can
and
rill
have
to
meet
all
sorts
of
downstream
common
law
nuisance
claims
and
nuisance
being
so
unique
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
like
any
other
tort.
the
unique
feature
of
nuisance
is
if
the
court
concludes
there
is
in
fact
a
nuisance,
the
great
danger
will
be
that
the
only
relief
is
abatement.
and
if
it
isn't
abatement,
if
you
do
not
abate,
you
run
the
risk
of
continuing
damage
every
day
you
keep
the
nuisance
in
place,
so
to
that
extent
in...
as
distinguished
from
any
other
tort,
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
tort
of
nuisance,
you
are
dealing
with
something
much
more
potent
and
as
equally
regulatory
as
the
remedy
of
abatement
or
the
remedy
of
punitive
damages.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
well,
if
federal
legislation
had
not
been
passed,
your
honor,
we
would
be
operating
under
the
federal
common
law,
because
i
believe
milwaukee
i
told
us
that
federal
law
controls
in
interstate
disputes.
to
that
extent--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--i
do,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
makes
a
valid
distinction,
and
i
think
the
prevailing
opinion
or
the
only
opinion
in
milwaukee
i
indicates,
i
believe,
that
the
character
of
the
parties,
as
justice
douglas
said
it,
the
character
of
the
parties
makes
no
difference
in
connection
with
this
issue.
so
i
don't
think,
whether
it
is
a
governmental
body
or
a
state
which
is
suing
or
whether
it
is
a
private
party
makes
any
difference
in
the
sense
of
the
application
of
the
federal
common
law
pre--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--yes,
your
honor,
precisely.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
but
it--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--in
the
source
state,
your
honor,
they
are.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
your
honor.
someone
could
have
brought
that
claim.
it
would
have
been--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--it
would
have
been
a
federal
law...
a
federal
common
law
claim
could
have
been
brought
in
new
york,
yes.
so,
if
i
may
harken
back
to
the
point
that
i
was
making
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
nuisance
and
the
government's
distinction,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
valid
distinction.
now,
there
are
several
other
arguments
upon
which
the
district
court
and
the
second
circuit
based
its
decision,
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
savings
clauses
of
the
clean
water
act
amendments
which
were
passed
in
1972,
and
to
begin
with,
as
justice
stevens
was
developing
in
questions
to
me,
it
is
our
position
that
even
prior
to
milwaukee
i,
an
issue
with
respect
to
interstate
waters,
resolution
of
disputes
in
that
area
would
have
been
covered
by
the
federal
common
law.
even
before
milwaukee
i
there
was
a
decision
of
this
court
in
hinderlider
which
we
have
referred
to
in
the
briefs
which
suggest
in
such
disputes,
disputes
with
respect
to
interstate
waters,
they
are
resolved
by
seeking
to
determine
under
the
guidance
of
federal
common
law.
when
you
talk
about
savings
clauses,
chronologically,
i
think
it
is
important
to
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
milwaukee
i
decision
came
down
in
april
of
1972.
the
clean
water
amendments
were
passed
in
october
of
1972.
as
of
the
time
milwaukee
i
came
down,
it,
i
believe,
flatly
said
that
there
are
no
rights
within
the
states
to
seek
to
impose
the
laws
of
the
states
with
respect
to
issues
dealing
with
interstate
water
pollution.
that
being
the
case,
and
federal
law
being
dominant,
as
of
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
i
respectfully
suggest
that
there
was
nothing
to
say.
there
were
no
state
remedies
which
could
exist
under
milwaukee
i.
the
remedies
with
respect
to
such
disputes
were
limited
to
resort
to
the
federal
common
law.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
the
federal
common
law.
now,
are
we
talking
about
an
interstate
body
of
water,
your
honor?
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
your
honor,
because
i
think
it
would
represent
an
attempt
by
a
state
to
impose
its
law
in
a
unitary
way
with
respect
to
a
controversy
that
was
interstate
and
more
federal
in
character
than
would
be
permissible.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
no,
i
think
it
is
the
application
of
the
law
of
another
state--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--into
the
law
of
the
source
state
which
would
be
prescribed,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
in
any
event,
the
point
that
i
was
making
is
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act
there
were
no
state
statutes
under
our
interpretation,
no
state
rights
to
be
saved.
i
might
also
say
that
the
burden
of
the
legislative
history
upon
which
those
who
make
this
argument
rely
is
legislative
history
which
was
generated
prior
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
milwaukee
i,
so
it
is
really
not
helpful
to
look
at
that
legislative
history
to
ascertain
the
intention
of
congress,
particularly
since
milwaukee
i
was
in
place
before
the
law
was
in
fact
passed.
the
two
particular
savings
provisions
to
which
the
courts
below
have
referred,
the
first
is
the
citizen
suit
provision
and
the
second
is
the
state
authority
provision.
with
respect
to
the
citizen
suit
provision
that
provision,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
milwaukee
ii,
is
almost
identical
if
not
actually
the
same
as
many
other
statutes
on
the
books
with
respect
to
environmental
matters,
so
that
it
is
not
really
capable
of
providing
any
guidance
with
respect
to
the
specific
intention
of
congress
when
it
passed
these
amendments
to
the
clean
water
act
as
to
what
it
intended
to
save,
what
was
there,
or
what
the
future
might
be
in
terms
of
the
law.
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
section
5.10.
section
5.10
has
been
held
again
by
this
court
to
relate
simply
to
matters
dealing
with
the
source
state,
and
i
might
also
say
that
a
section
of
the
law
prior
to
the
amendments
in
1972
quite
comparable
to
this
was
not
believed
at
the
time
milwaukee
i
was
decided
to
have
any
effect.
there
was
a
comparable
statute
on
the
books
and
when
justice
douglas's
opinion
came
out
in
milwaukee
i,
it
gave
no
heed
to
that
provision
as
preserving
states'
rights.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
very
much
like
to
reserve
the
few
remaining
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
just
carry
on
with
the
hypothetical
that
justice
powell
proposed
because
i
think
it
highlights
the
dilemma
for
the
discharger,
and
you
take
the
discharger
in
montana
at
the
headwaters
of
the
mississippi
under
the
government's
theory
can
be
sued
by
all
of
those
18
or
so
states
along
the
mississippi
under
the
common
law
of
any
of
those
states
for
compensatory
damages,
and
that
is
the
tragedy
of
permitting
these
individual
states
to
use
their
own
law
to
circumvent
the
intention
of
the
act.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
no,
i
will
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
but
there
is
an
expert
in
louisiana
who
is
waiting
to
say
that
there
is,
and
that
is
my
problem.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
that
is
the
very
practical
dilemma
which
we
face.
incidentally,
before
milwaukee
i,
hinderlider
was
in
place,
and
as
i
read
that
case
it
flatly
says
interstate
disputes
with
respect
to
water.
that
wasn't
pollution,
that
was
sharing
of
water.
clearly
a
common
issue,
though,
your
honor,
because
a
discharge
and
pollution
is
a
sharing
of
interstate
waters
in
the
same
sense
as
usage
is.
it
is
the
same
thing
part
and
parcel.
with
all
due
respect,
sea
clammers
obviously,
as
we
interpret
it,
does
not
permit
a
private
suit
for
violation
of
the
act,
but
we
are
not
trying
to
deny
these
plaintiffs
a
right
to
sue
in
the
source
state
using
source
state
law
and
to
recover
for
the
nuisance
which
they
suggest
has
taken
place
here.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
relying
on...
and
relying
on
new
york
law
and
relying
upon
actually
what
the
statute
itself
provides
in
terms
of
the
forum
and
in
terms
of
the
law
to
be
applied.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
well,
i
must...
let
me
answer
that
fully
because
there
is
an
issue
that
i
would
like
to
raise
with
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
extent,
and
you
get
into
this
when
you
deal
with
property
issues,
cases
relating
to
injury
to
property,
whether
you
have
a
transitory
action
or
not
a
transitory
action,
which
is
a
minefield
of
difficulty
going
way
back
to
1811,
when
justice
marshall
wrote
a
decision
in
the
livingston
case
and
dealt
with
the
doctrine
which
has
really
been
eroded
over
the
course
of
years
that
there
should
be
no--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--yes,
your
honor,
if
new
york
would
provide
for
it.
yes.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
the
vermont
plaintiff?
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
basically
because
the
statute
provides
a
scheme
under
which
the
source
state
is
the
place
to
go.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
for
the
same
reason
that
the
mississippi
hypothetical
creates
the
tragedy
you
see
there,
the
same
would
be
true
if
you
permitted
that
plaintiff
to
circumvent,
to
go
around
and
do
by
the
back
door--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--no,
your
honor.
we
respectfully
submit
it
would
not
be,
that
he
would
have
to
sue
in
the
source
state
because
that
is
the
forum
that
the
law
suggests
is
appropriate
for
dealing
with
this
problem
under
505(c)
of
the
act,
and
if
you
lose
that--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--it
is
not
a
matter
of
personal
jurisdiction.
we
don't
challenge
that.
we
are
in
vermont.
we
challenge
it
on
the
basis
of
what
the
statutory
scheme
in
fact
permits,
your
honor,
or
suggests
ought
to
be
the
way
forum
is
resolved,
keeping
and
enabling
the
discharger
to
understand
where
it
is
he
is
going
to
be
challenged.
