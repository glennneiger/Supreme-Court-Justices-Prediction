you
say
when
the
state
undertakes
the
job
then
it
gives
notice,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
undertakes
what
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
making
the
law
or
just...
or
making
its
own
law
conforming
to
federal
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
someone
sues
and
says
a
discharge
is
not
conforming
with
the
law,
is
it
state
law
that
he
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--acting
under
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
what
this...
that
isn't
what
this
case
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
any
state
law
applicable?
it
is
because
congress
said
it
could
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
new
york
can--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
congress
says
the
source...
the
state
may
make
the
law
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
just
told
me
the
state
could
set
the
standards,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
say
that
congress
anticipated
that
the
source
state
would
set
such
standards
if
it
undertook
the
job.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
aren't...
say
the
suit
is
that
here
you
have
a
permit
under
new
york
law
and
i
claim
that
you
are
violating
the
new
york
standards,
and
that
is
a
claim
under
new
york
law,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
could
go
right
into
federal
court
on
a
claim
like
that
if
you
live
in
the
same
state
as
the
discharger?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is...
so
it
is
not
a
federal
question
in
my
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
to
have
to
apply
new
york
law.
