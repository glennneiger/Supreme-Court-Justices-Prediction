mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
difference
between
the
kind
of
case
we
have
before
us
and
cases
that
are
brought
under
what
are
called
the
citizens'
suit
provisions
of
the
federal
act.
there
is
such
a
provision.
it
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
page
a-51,
the
citizens
suit
provision
to
enforce
standards
under
permits
issued
under
the
federal
act,
and
those
suits
can
be
brought
regardless
of
whether
the
permit
is
issued
by
epa
or
by
a
state
which
has
been
authorized
under
the
federal
act
to
issue
permits
so
long
as
it
meets
the
federally
prescribed
standards
and
adds
whatever
additional
standards
it
wishes
to
add.
those
citizen
suits
enable
the
plaintiff
to
get
injunctive
relief
to
require
compliance
with
the
permit,
and
they--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
they
are.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
district
courts
are
given
federal
question
jurisdiction
right
in
this
provision,
section
1365,
page
a-51.
and
the
other
relief
that
can
be
secured
is
civil
penalty
relief.
we
have
discussed
this
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
and
we
show
there
that
any
civil
penalties
secured
are
shown
by
the
legislative
history
to
be
payable
to
the
federal
treasury,
not
to
the
plaintiffs
in
such
cases,
and
this
court
held
in
the
sea
clammers
case
in
453
us
that
there
is
no
implied
right
of
action
under
the
federal
statute
for
damages
by
someone
claiming
to
be
damaged
by
violation
of
the
permit
standards
nor
can
a
1983
suit
be
brought.
what
the
court
did
not
address
in
sea
clammers
and
what
is
before
the
court
today
is
whether
suits
can
be
brought
under
state
nuisance
law
for
damages
and
for
other
relief,
and
that
is
what
we
are
here
to
address.
our
answer
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
decided
this
case
is
yes
and
no,
but
mostly
yes,
and
certainly
yes
in
its
result
of
refusing
to
order
dismissal
of
the
complaint,
and
if
the
court
please,
i
will
briefly
summarize
our
position
and
then
proceed
to
the
reasons
why.
we
agree
that
a
state
court
and
by
extension
a
federal
court
sitting
in
diversity
jurisdiction
can
entertain
respondents'
state
law
claims
for
compensatory
damages,
punitive
damages,
and
injunctive
relief,
and
as
to
compensatory
damages
the
court
sitting
in
vermont
can
and
should
apply
either
vermont
or
new
york
law,
depending
on
vermont's
choice
of
law
rules,
but
as
to
punitive
damages
or
injunctive
relief
we
believe
the
effect
of
the
federal
law
is
to
preserve
only
the
law
of
the
source
state
and
thus
to
require
the
vermont
court
to
apply
new
york
law,
including
new
york
choice
of
law
principles.
now,
this
may,
particularly
in
the
damages
remedies,
bounce
back
to
vermont
law
if
the
new
york
courts
would
apply
this,
but
this
is
not
merely
an
academic
question,
because
it
identifies
where
the
legislative
jurisdiction
lies,
which
state
legislature
would
have
the
power
to
supersede
the
rule
of
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
view.
and
that
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
question
in
the
case
as
we
see
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
and
for
punitive
damages--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
it
wished.
that
is
clear
to
us.
to
us
the
clearest
aspect
of
the
case
is
that
the
authority
of
the
source
state
to
exceed
the
federal
act's
requirements
in
any
of
the
respects
remains
unimpaired.
we
don't
think
the
principle
of
milwaukee
i
ever
was
intended
to
limit
the
source
state's
authority
to
deal
with
in-state
pollution.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
with
respect
to
compensatory
damages.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
injunctions.
not
injunctive
relief.
we
have
said
that
the
vermont
court,
while
it
can
entertain
the
case,
has
to
apply
new
york
law
with
respect
to
injunctive
relief.
that
seems
to
us
to
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
what
we
are
saying
with
respect
to
compensatory
damages
is
that
even
though
there
is
compliance
with
the
federal
act
if...
and
the
discharger
must
remain
free
to
remain
in
business,
if
he
is
actually
damaging
someone,
and
that
can
be
proved
in
court,
and
the
standards
of
a
nuisance
action
are
meant,
then
he
will
have
to
bear
the
cost
for
any
actual
injury
that
unreasonably
results
under
the
nuisance
law
if
it
can
be
proved
that
he
caused
it
and
if
it
meets
the
standards
of
unreasonable
conduct
under
nuisance
law
and
the
fact
that
there
was
a
federal
permit
under
the
federal
act
would
certainly
be
relevant
to
the
reasonableness
of
what
occurred.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
long
as
it
were
only
compensatory
damages--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
there
were--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--prove
the
injury
and
cause
of
the
injury.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
believe
that
the
federal
law--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
has
to
be
the
result
so
long
as
the
source
state
were
willing
to
apply
its
law
that
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
believe
it
is,
mr.
justice.
milwaukee
i
addressed
the
problem
of
another
state
other
than
the
source
state
trying
to
abate
the
operation
in
the
source
state,
trying
to
order
that
an
operation
authorized
in
the
source
state
be
discontinued
or
changed
in
some
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
they
are
unreasonably
causing
injury
under
that
state's
law,
which
protects
the
people
being
injured--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--no,
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
is
not
a
federal
standard,
but
there
are
federal
constitutional
limitations
on
what
states
can
do
against
out
of
state
sources.
there
are
limitations
in
the
federal
constitution
against
state
discrimination
against
out
of
state
businesses
both...
under
the
commerce
clause.
there
is
the
article
iv
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
there
are
equal
protection
limitations.
the
state
is
not
wholly
unlimited
and,
of
course,
congress
can
always
limit
it
further,
but
what
is
apparent
in
the
act
is
that
congress
meant
to
preserve
damage
remedies,
and
as
this
court
held
in
silkwood,
and
the
court
was
unanimous
with
respect
to
compensatory
damages
that
even
though
there
is
a
comprehensive
federal
regulatory
scheme,
if
that
scheme
did
not
provide
for
damages
for
persons
injured,
the
ordinary
assumption
is
that
congress
continued
to
rely
on
state
law
to
provide
for
the
damages.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not,
which
is
the
reason
we
think
the
punitive
damages
situation
is
different,
because
as
in
silkwood
we
think
punitive
damages
were
preserved
in
this
scheme,
but
only
in
the
source
state,
and
silkwood
did
not
address
the
problem
of
interstate
punitive
damages
which
seems
to
us
to
come
within
the
milwaukee
i
principle
of
a
regulatory
measure,
and
there
isn't
the
same
compelling
need
to
recognize
the
interstate
punitive
damages
because
punitive
damages
are
still
available
if
the
source
state
is
willing
to
provide
them.
it
isn't
a
question
of
all
or
nothing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
exactly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
ultimately
the
principle
of
milwaukee
i
because
as
we
read
milwaukee
ii
what
milwaukee
ii
said
was
that
the
provisions,
and
they
are
elaborated
in
milwaukee
ii
much
more
than
we
did
in
our
brief,
the
provisions
for
the
affected
states'
participation
in
the
process
give
the
affected
state
sufficient
recourse
under
the
federal
act
that
it
no
longer
should
have
to
resort
to
federal
common
law
and
the
need
to
create
federal
common
law
has
been
superseded
by
the
ability
of
the
affected
state
under
the
federal
act
to
influence
the
standards
that
are
to
be
applied
so
it
no
longer
has
to
resort
to
federal
common
law
for
abatement,
but
milwaukee
ii
never
said
that
the
federal
act
changed
the
inhibitions
that
milwaukee
i
recognized
on
out-of-state
regulation
that
necessitated
resort
to
a
federal
common
law
in
the
first
place
in
the
abatement
context.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
was
an
open
question.
milwaukee
i
answered
the
question,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
don't
believe
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
we
don't
see
any--
