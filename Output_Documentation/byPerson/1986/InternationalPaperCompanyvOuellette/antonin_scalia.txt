why

you
say
that
it
is
a
state
law

right,
and
even
though
the
level
of
discharge
and
the
technological
requirements
are
established
by
the
state,
if
you
violate
that
you
are
violating
a
federal
law,
right,
and
the
suit
would
be
for
violation
of
federal
law.

you
had
two

you
could
bring

in
federal
court.
