unknown
speaker
well,
now
you
have
given
two
different
answers
to
the
same
question.
unknown
speaker
because
that
would
solve
the
whole
question
of
whether
vermont
can
apply
its
own
law,
if
the
only
law
that
is
applicable
to
this
discharge
is
a
federal
law.
well,
whatever
court
you
have
to
bring
it
in
is
going
to
apply
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on,
in
that
new
york
state
nuisance
action
i
assume
that
new
york
state
could
have
the
standards
of
pollution
that
are
necessary
to
sustain
a
nuisance
action
a
good
deal
lower
than
the
standards
that
it
fixes
for
purposes
of
the
federal
water
pollution
act,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
it
could.
i
mean,
that
is,
unless
you
are
a
really
bad
polluter
there
is
no
nuisance
action.
you
can
be
a
polluter
without
being
a
nuisance.
new
york
could
write
its
law
that
way
if
it
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
because
it
wasn't
a
nuisance
wouldn't
mean
that
you
wouldn't
have
another
cause
of
action
for
violation
of
the
permit.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
reardon,
i
take
it
the
federal
government
here
takes
the
position
that
it
is
also
possible
to
have
a
common
law
damages
action
in
the
state
of
vermont--
unknown
speaker
--based
on
whatever
new
york
state
has
set
as
the
pollution
limit.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
that
it
could
be
in
either
vermont
state
or
federal
district
court.
unknown
speaker
and
you
plan
to
address
that?
unknown
speaker
does
our...
does
this
court's
decision
in
silkwood
and
kerr-mcgee
have
some
relevance
to
that
inquiry,
do
you
suppose?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
the
thrust
of
it
is
that
tort
remedies,
state
tort
remedies
may
be
compatible
even
with
a
comprehensive
federal
regulatory
schemes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
reardon,
had
the
federal
legislation
never
been
passed...
just
assume
we
never
had
any
federal
legislation...
then
you
would
have
precisely
the
same
problem,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
even
when
it
is
purely
private
parties,
you
think
that
was
clear?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
your
view
you
should
prevail
unless
the
federal
legislation
had
the
effect
of
creating
an
additional
remedy
for
private
citizens
of
vermont
that
did
not
previously
exist?
unknown
speaker
or
unless
the
federal
law
sale
we
will
let
state
common
law
control.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
say
that
new
york
nuisance
actions
are
available--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
that
wouldn't
have
been
true,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
been
true,
yes,
it
would,
under
milwaukee
i
because
it
is
just
the
source
state.
unknown
speaker
no
one
in
vermont
could
have.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
milwaukee
i
ruled
out
a
suit
in
a
state
court
claiming
state
remedies?
unknown
speaker
an
interstate
body
of
water
in
the
same
sense
that
hinderlider
versus
laplata
was.
unknown
speaker
that
is
easy
to
see
where
it
is,
let's
say
the
source
of
pollution
is
new
york
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
milwaukee
i
would
prevent
vermont
from
applying
its
law
to
a
new
york
polluter.
would
milwaukee
i
necessarily
prevent
new
york
from
applying
its
law
to
a
new
york
source
that
is
polluting
in
vermont?
i
mean,
the
rationale
of
the
case
is
interstate
conflict,
and
there
is
no
interstate
conflict
here.
new
york
is
applying
its
law
to
a
polluter
within
new
york,
and
allows
a
vermont
citizen
to
sue
in
new
york
courts
for
the
pollution.
would
milwaukee
i
have
prevented
that?
unknown
speaker
of
vermont.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
are
referring
to
in-state,
though.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
is
not
clearly
referring
to
an
interstate
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
but
what
milwaukee
i
said
is
that
there
wasn't
any,
and
that
was
before
the
statute
was
passed.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
what
state
law
did
you
have?
once
you
said
that
there
is
no
state
law
on
the
matter
but
only
federal
common
law,
what
state
law
was
preserved
by
these
preservation
clauses?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it
is
essential
to
your
case
then
that
we
read
milwaukee
i
very
narrowly.
unknown
speaker
if
we
do
say
that
then
you
don't
have
a
suit
on
vermont
law
or
on
new
york
law.
unknown
speaker
on
vermont
law,
anyway,
right.
unknown
speaker
it
still
says
we
are
still
talking
about
federal
common
law.
whatever
you
do
choose
to--
unknown
speaker
--there
would
be
a...
wouldn't
there
be
an
action
based
on
a
claimed
violation
of
the
permit?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you
don't
say
you
don't
have
a
remedy.
you
just
say
you
don't
have
a
remedy
to
enforce
standards
higher
than
the
permit.
unknown
speaker
if
the
violation...
if
you
proved
a
violation
of
the
permit
and
proved
that
that
violation
was
causing
you
damage,
you
would
recover
something.
unknown
speaker
well,
sea
clammers
said
that
the
statutory
remedies
given
private
parties
foreclosed
any
other
private
remedies,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
foreclosed
a
1983
remedy,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
foreclosed...
it
said
congress
didn't
intend
any
private
remedies
other
than
what
it
provided
for.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
reached
a
position
of
as
private
suit
under
1983.
unknown
speaker
which
would
have
given
a
remedy
in
damages
which
the
statutory
suit
would
not.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
congress
intended
to
foreclose
any
private
remedies
except
damage
remedies.
unknown
speaker
but
not
a
damage
remedy
under
1983.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
you
said
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
damage
suit
perhaps
the
only
kind
of
a
carnage
suit
you
are
entitled
to
is
one
in
which
you
prove
a
violation
of
the
permit.
unknown
speaker
because
the
statutory
scheme
is
such
that
people
give...
new
york
is
given
a
permit
consistent
with
federal
standards.
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
allowed...
it
allows
new
york
to
set
higher
standards.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
it
allows
vermont
to
set
higher
standards
also.
unknown
speaker
for
dischargers
in
a
foreign
state.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
new
york
nuisance
law.
unknown
speaker
even
though
there
is
no
violation
of
the
permit.
unknown
speaker
what
about
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
think
there
is
any
flat
rule
on
your
getting
an
injunction
against
these
dischargers
whether
they
are
consistent
with
the
permit
or
not?
unknown
speaker
here
is
the
problem
with
that.
it
is
clear
from
the
structure
of
the
act
that
the
polluting
state,
the
source
state
was
to
have
the
main
call
on
what
the
level
of
protection
was
going
to
be
both
as
to
permitting,
since
they
would
set
the
permit
level,
and
also
as
to
whether
they
want
to
go
above
that
level
in
their
own
domestic
law.
now,
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
the
source
state
can
adopt
some
domestic
law
allowing
injunctions
even
when
the
permit
is
not
violated,
but
if
you
allow
the
non-source
state
to
do
that
you
are
in
effect
allowing
the
non-source
state
to
do
the
same
thing
as
permitting
the
plant,
because
you
can't
operate
without
a
permit.
similarly,
you
can't
operate
if
you
have
an
injunction
from
a
vermont
court.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
i
am
just
talking
about
vermont
law
right
now.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
what
the
statute
does.
the
statute
does
give
a
preeminent
position
to
the
source
state,
and
if
you
want
to
protect
against
that
perhaps
some
residual
federal
common
law
can
prevent
against
it,
but
to
say
that
vermont
can
step
in
and
interpose
its
own
law
to
prevent
it
is
contrary
to
the
scheme
of
the
act,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
act
just
allow
neighboring
states
to
come
in
in
an
advisory
capacity
to
comment
upon
the
permit
levels?
it
doesn't
permit
them
the
right
to
establish
permit
levels
with
respect
to
pollution
that
is
coming
in
their
direction.
they
can
only
advise,
and
the
source
state
sets
the
levels.
doesn't
that
indicate
that
they
are
supposed
to
have--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
you
mean
the
federal
government
goes
to
the
trouble
of
saying
that
vermont
cannot
work
its
will
through
the
permitting
process
but
it
is
perfectly
okay
if
they
do
it
through
nuisance
law?
i
would
consider
that
to
be
a
conflict
with
the
federal
scheme.
unknown
speaker
0
xxx.
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
is
a
state
permit
and
the
state
has
jacked
up
the
standards?
unknown
speaker
compensatory
damages
in
your
view,
mr.
wallace,
might
be
awarded
under
vermont
law?
unknown
speaker
it
is
actually
less
important
for
purposes
of
this
case
than
it
is
for
in-state
pollution.
i
assume
that
you
would
take
the
same
position
with
regard
to
in-state
pollution,
and
you
would
say
that
the
state
of
new
york
can
have
a
nuisance
action...
well,
you'd
say
it
could
do
it
both
for
compensatory
and
for
injunctive
relief,
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
for
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
it
would
help
me
understand
the
government's
position
if
i
suggested
a
specific
concrete
example.
the
federal
act
applies
to
any
waterway.
i
don't
think
it
is
even
limited
on
its
face
to
navigable
waters.
so
that
every
state
on
the
mississippi
and
missouri
rivers,
for
example,
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
could
apply
its
own
state
common
law
of
nuisance
to
obtain
injunctions
and
compensatory
damages
against
a
manufacturer
that
happened
to
have
a
plant
somewhere
on
that
river,
with
the
result
that
there
may
be
ten
or
twelve
or
more
states
with
different
regulatory
standards.
is
that
the
government's
position?
unknown
speaker
and
injunctions?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
compensatory
damages
a
company
would
have
to
comply,
for
example,
with
a
dozen
different
standards,
despite
the
federal
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
another
state
had...
under
its
tort
law
there
was
strict
liability
for
water
pollution,
you
would
say
that
may
be
enforced
also.
not
just
a
nuisance
question.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
prove
the
injury
and
collect
your
money.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
polluter
was
living
up
to
all
of
the
provisions
of
his
permit?
unknown
speaker
but
the
source
state...
what
do
you
do
with
milwaukee
i?
suppose
new
york
has
established
its
nuisance
law
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
says
it
can't
be
a
nuisance
so
long
as
it
is
complying
with
the
federal
standards
that
we
promulgated.
now,
that
is
the
rule
that
new
york
wants.
all
right,
vermont
comes
in
and
says,
we
disagree
with
that,
even
though
you
do
comply
with
the
standards,
we
think
it
is
a
nuisance
in
vermont.
now,
isn't
that
precisely
the
kind
of
a
situation
that
milwaukee
i
was
worried
about
and
tried
to
avoid
by
saying
this
is
a
matter
that
ought
to
be
handled
by
federal
common
law?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
is
perfectly
okay
if
they
make
them
pay
continuing
damages
every
day
for
the
continuing
pollution,
so
long
as
they
don't
say
stop?
that's
the
line?
unknown
speaker
well,
strike
unreasonably.
if
they
are
causing
injury
under
that
state's
law.
are
you
applying
a
federal
unreasonably
standard
to
that
state's
law--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
so
if
they
are
causing
injury
under
that
state's
law--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
interstate
problem
is
not
extant
there,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
may
i
just
follow
up
with
one
question
on
this?
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
the
receiving
state
retains
the
compensatory
damage
remedy
but
it
is
precluded...
this
is
where
you
differ
with
the
district
court...
it
is
precluded
from
the
abatement
and
the
punitive
damage
remedy.
unknown
speaker
and
in
your
view
what
is
the
legal
source,
not
the
practical
argument,
of
that
preclusion?
is
it
the
statute?
is
it
milwaukee
i?
or
did
it
never
exist?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
that
before
milwaukee
i
was
ever
decided
it
would
have
been
permissible
for
the
receiving
state
to
bring
an
abatement
action
in
a
punitive
damage
claim?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
you
don't
think
it
answered
the
question
of
a
private
compensatory
damage
suit.
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
read...
you
say
this
is
the
most
difficult
issue,
and
the
reason
it
is
difficult
is
that
how
broadly
do
you
read
milwaukee
i?
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
federal
law,
federal
common
law
completely
preempted
all
actions
in
interstate
pollution
cases.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
your
example
kind
of
cuts
the
other
way,
because
there
is
not
much
pollution
in
montana
that
is
going
to
go
all
the
way
to
louisiana.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you
would
take
his
case
on
a
contingent
basis,
though.
unknown
speaker
and
relying
on
new
york
law?
unknown
speaker
new
york
courts
would
normally
give
a
remedy
to...
under
new
york
law
to
injury
caused
outside
the
state
by
conduct
occurring
inside
the
state?
unknown
speaker
that's
it,
whether
it
is
a
water
case
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
vermont,
the
vermont
plaintiff
could
come
over
to
new
york
and
not
only
get
compensatory
damages
but
punitive
damages?
unknown
speaker
why
not
in
vermont?
why
can't
he
sue
in
vermont
on
the
same
cause
of
action
in
vermont
court?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but--
--this
is
not
a
statutory
cause
of
action.
he
is
suing
on
a
state
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
he
is
not
circumventing...
he
sues
in
a
vermont
court
and
he
says
i
am
suing
under
new
york
law.
this
is
a
diversity
action
and
we
are
going
to
apply
new
york
law.
wouldn't
that
be
permissible?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
one
thing
to
say
he
couldn't
apply
vermont
law,
but
it
is
certainly
another
thing
to
say
that
he
couldn't
sue
in
vermont,
and
as
long
as
he
can
get
jurisdiction
over
his
defendant
why
couldn't
he
apply
new
york
law?
