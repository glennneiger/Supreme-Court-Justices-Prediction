justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
petitioner
operates
a
paper
mill
on
the
new
york
shore
of
lake
champlain.
respondents
are
property
owners
whose
land
is
located
across
the
lake
on
the
vermont
shore.
respondents
brought
suit
in
the
vermont
district
court,
claiming
that
the
mill
was
discharging
pollutants
into
the
lake,
and
that
this
caused
a
continuing
nuisance
under
vermont
law.
under
present
procedures
authorized
by
the
clean
water
act,
petitioner
has
obtained
a
premit
to
make
these
discharges
in
accordance
with
both
the
new
york
and
federal
law.
two
questions
are
presented:
first,
whether
the
vermont
court
has
jurisdiction,
and
second
whether
in
light
of
the
provisions
of
the
clean
water
act,
the
nuisance
law
of
vermont
maybe
applied
when
the
source
of
pollution
is
in
new
york.
petitioner
moved
for
summary
judgment
claiming
that
under
the
clean
water
act
the
suit
could
only
be
maintained
in
new
york,
the
state
in
which
the
mill
is
located.
the
district
court
denied
petitioners
motion
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
for
the
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
agree
that
the
property
owners
could
maintain
this
action
in
the
vermont
federal
court.
we
also
find
however
that
the
courts
below
erred
in
holding
that
the
case
could
be
decided
under
the
nuisance
law
of
vermont.
under
the
clean
water
act,
new
york,
as
a
source
stated,
has
authority
to
issue
a
permit
consistent
with
both
federal
and
state
law.
the
clean
water
act
is
a
comprehensive
regulatory
statute
applicable
to
navigable
waters
in
every
state.
we
think
the
act
preempts
all
inconsistent
state
laws
that
would
interfere
with
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
act,
if
every
affected
state
could
apply
its
own
law.
we
therefore
conclude
that
to
the
extent
a
vermont
law
may
differ
from
that
of
new
york,
it
is
preempted.
accordingly
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
