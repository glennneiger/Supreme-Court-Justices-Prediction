justice

white
but
that
wouldn't
defeat
your
right
to
a
refund,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn't
go
back
and
collect
the
tax
retroactively
from
all
the
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
case
isn't
a
moot
case
just
because
the...
just
because
the
exemption
could
be
eliminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you...
how
does
the
state
justify
exempting
charities
from
taxation
at
all,
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
they
don't...
a
charity
doesn't
pay
income
taxes,
its
property
isn't
subject
to
real
estate
taxes.
how
does
the
state
justify
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
state
can
exempt
a
charity
from
taxation,
why
can't
it
exempt
the
sale
of
its
magazines
from
sales
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
exempt
the
sale
of
its
magazines
from
sales
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might?
would
it
or
would
it
not?
and
how
would
you
test
it?
by
just,
would
you
say
a
strict
scrutiny?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
magazines
sold
in
arkansas
that
would
qualify
for
the
exemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
they
just
out
of
the
kindness
of
their
heart
collect
the
sales
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
answer
is
that
they
do
collect
the
sales
tax
when
they
sell?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
do
not
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
don't
collect
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
a
failure
of
enforcement.
you
mean
it's
just
a
failure
to
insist
that
they
apply
for
an
exemption.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
people
collect
the
tax
when
they
don't
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
usually
somebody
who
is
supposed
to
collect
the
tax
and
doesn't
is
going
to
have
to
pay
the
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
i
take
it
these
magazines
had
a
responsibility
to
collect
it
unless
they
got
an
exemption.
if
they
don't
apply
for
the
exemption
and
they
don't
collect
the
tax,
why
shouldn't
they
have
to
pay
the
tax
themselves?
