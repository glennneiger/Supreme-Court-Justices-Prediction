justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
show...
just
to
be
sure,
the
record
shows
that
the
exemption
has
never
been
applied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
that
evidence...
but
does
the
record
show
that?
i'm
not
questioning
the
accuracy
of
what
you
tell
me,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
what
would
happen
to
a
publisher
who
was
perfectly...
talked
to
a
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
said,
oh,
you're
clearly
exempt
because
this
is
a
religious
publication,
and
he
said
thank
you
and
started
to
publish,
and
didn't...
he
published
a
purely
religious
thing
they
sent
out
every
sunday
or
something
like
that.
and
he
just
never
paid
the
tax
and
never
applied
for
an
exemption.
what...
could
he
be
put
in
jail
or
penalized
in
any
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
he
doesn't
have
any
tax.
he
clearly
would
qualify
for
an
exemption
if
he
went
through
the
procedure.
he
does
nothing
but
publish
a
religious
publication,
and
he's
been
doing
this
for
five
years
and
somebody
in
the
tax
department
finds
out
and
says:
hey,
you
should
have
filed
for
an
exemption.
and
he
says:
i'm
sorry;
i'll
do
it
now.
what
would
happen
to
him
for
the
past
five
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
was
just
going
to
say,
it
seems
to
me
the
fact
that
no
exemptions
have
been
granted
in
this
category,
as
you've
explained
to
us,
does
not
mean
that
it
is
not
entirely
possible
that
there
are
a
lot
of
religious
publications
that
simply
didn't
bother
to
apply
for
the
exemption
because
they
realized
they
wouldn't
get
into
any
trouble.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
talking
about
those
that
would
qualify
for
the
exemption.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
haven't
really
satisfied
me
that
there
may
not
be
publications
in
arkansas
that
would
qualify
for
the
exemption
that
this
publisher
would
not
qualify
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
any
other
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
general
clark,
i
guess
it
does
involve
content
to
this
extent.
i
don't
suppose
you
could
publish
time
magazine
and
just
label
it
"local
sports
magazine"
and
just
say
everything
else
is
unimportant.
you
wouldn't
qualify
as
a
sports
publication
just
by
calling
it
sports,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
said
the
purpose
basically
is
to
foster
communication
by
magazines
that
would
not
otherwise
be
able
to
make
a
profit,
in
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
it's
to
foster
some
communication
and
not
others,
for
a
purpose
that
is
not
evident
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
at
least
that's
clear,
because
i
suppose
there
could
be
other...
other
than
these
four
categories,
there
could
be
economically
marginal
publications
that
would
not
get
the
same
benefit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
publications
on
how
to
play
poker,
or
publications
on
how
to
do
lots
of
things
that
aren't
necessarily
one
of
those
categories.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
very
publication
we've
got
before
us
in
this
case?
why
doesn't
it
need
the
same
kind
of
help?
i
guess
it
doesn't
make
millions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
hadn't
it
been
denied
the...
or
the
state
was
assessing
the...
you
say
it
had
never
applied
for
the
exemption,
is
that
what
it
amounts
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
must
have
made
that
stipulation
at
your
request,
at
the
tax
authority's
request.
they
must
have
asked
them
to
make
that
acknowledgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did?
that's
kind
of
a
surprise,
for
somebody
who's
trying
to
avoid
taxation...
well,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
just
clarify
one
thing,
because
i
didn't
quite
follow
it.
if
they
were
to
take
the
opposite
position
and
say,
well,
we
are
one
of
these
exempt
publications
and
therefore...
and
you
agreed...
and
therefore
we're
entitled
to
be
exempt
from
the
sales
tax,
would
they
lose
the
exemption
from
the
advertising
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
really,
it
would
be
in
their
interest
just
to
get
out
of
the
four...
to
get
into
that
category?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
we
have
a
marginal
sports
publication,
it
can
get
both
the
advertising
exemption
and
the
sales
tax
exemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
it
fits
one
of
the
four
categories,
sports
or
religion
for
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
get
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
advertising
space,
if
there
is
discrimination
here,
the
advertising
exemption
really
doesn't
have
any
effect
on
the
discrimination
in
the
sales
tax
area,
if
it
does
exist,
because
everybody
gets
the
advertising
exemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
what
they
should
have
done
is
describe
the
category
they
tried
to
protect
as
those
publications
who
don't
have
substantial
advertising
revenues.
that
would
have
accomplished
their
purpose
in
a
neutral
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that's
easier
to
apply
than
this
four-pronged
standard
they
came
up
with.
