mr.
john
steven
clark
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
realizing
that
the
appellant
relies
heavily
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
minneapolis
star
case,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
this
case,
arkansas
writers
versus
ragland,
is
clearly
distinguishable.
the
facts
in
this
case
does
not
give
rise
to
a
first
amendment
violation.
the
arkansas
tax
is
not
a
tax
on
a
publisher,
but
rather
the
ultimate
purchaser,
the
consumer.
the
minnesota
tax
was
applied
to
the
publisher.
the
arkansas
legislature
in
granting
a
tax
exemption,
a
benefit,
as
a
part
of
its
general
taxing
scheme...
and
that
scheme
in
development
was
not
to
single
out
and
did
not
single
out
or
target
the
press.
that's
not
true
with
the
minnesota
statute.
the
arkansas
tax
does
not
affect
specifically
identifiable
individual
taxpayers.
it
could
not
have.
as
ms.
wilson
has
pointed
out
to
you,
it
was
adopted
in
1948,
long
before
the
arkansas
times
as
a
publication
ever
came
into
existence.
it
does
not
single
out
any
individual
members
of
the
media
or
of
the
press.
that
was
not
true
of
the
minnesota
statute.
it's
been
well
established
by
this
court
that
the
press
is
not
immune
from
any
of
the
ordinary
forms
of
taxation
that
support
ordinary
governmental
functions.
the
arkansas
general
sales
tax
scheme
was
adopted
in
1935
and
has
been
amended
many
times
since
then
to
promote
the
general
welfare
of
our
state
through
free
public
education,
free
text
libraries,
and
protection
of
wards
of
the
state.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
submit
to
this
court
it
does
not.
the
general
taxing
scheme
provided
for
some
exemptions,
some
benefits.
among
those
which
were
three;
one
to
newspapers,
which
were
exempt
from
sales
tax
on
the
sale
of
that
product.
the
reason
behind
that--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--yes,
ma'am,
your
honor.
the
provision
that
dealt
with
the
four
generic
types
of
publications...
sport,
trade,
professional,
and
religion.
the
arkansas
general
assembly,
i
submit
to
this
court,
in
its
effort
in
adopting
that
standard
was
to
promote
those
publications,
realizing
that
they
did
not
have
the
same
revenue
base
in
terms
of
advertising
that
an
publication
like
the
arkansas
times
might
have,
which
also
enjoys
an
exemption
from
sales
tax
on
advertising
space
sold
which
contributes
from
60
to
90
percent
of
the
income
of
those
type
publications.
with
these
four
generic
types,
your
honor,
the
arkansas
general
assembly
in
its
wisdom
i
believe
determined
that
there
was
not
an
advertising
base
because
of
a
low
subscription
interest.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
it's
only
those
four
generic
types
of
publications.
it
does
not
deal
with
content;
it
deals
with
a
classification
as
to
a
generic
description,
a
type
of
description
the
arkansas
general
assembly
tried
to
apply
to
a
host
of
publications.
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
that
in
arkansas
there
is
no
publication...
there
are
no
publications
of
which
we
are
aware
that
has
ever
benefited
from
this
classification
as
a
religious,
a
trade,
a
sport,
or
a
professional
publication.
there
are
none
that
we
are
aware
of
who
have
made
requests
for
that
benefit
and
have
received
it.
mr.
john
steven
clark
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
your
honor.
there
are
two
other
publications.
that
information
was
part
of
the
lower
court
record
and
the
protective
order,
the
two
others
who
do
qualify
for
general
taxation
as
does
the
arkansas
times.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
the
exemption...
we
have
gone
back
to
our
tax
administrator
and
reviewed
all
of
our
records.
we
can
find
no
evidence.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
the
record
does
not.
as
you
recall,
in
the
lower
court
the
arkansas
times
stipulated
that
it
was
neither
a
newspaper
nor
one
of
these
four
generic
types
of
publications.
mr.
john
steven
clark
the
only
affidavit
from
the
state
tax
administrator
was
to
the
effect
that
there
were
other
publications
subject
to
this
general
sales
tax
other
than
the
arkansas
times.
he
was
not
asked
and
did
not
produce
information
as
to
whether
the
exemption
had
ever
been
applied.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
they
just--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--your
honor,
i
do
not
know
the
reason
why
they
do
not
seek
this
benefit.
but
the
record--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--there
are
three
publications,
your
honor,
for
which
the
sales
tax
is
to
be
collected
and
remitted
back
to
the
state,
the
arkansas
times
being
one
and
there
are
two
others.
there
may
be
publications
in
the
state
that
would
fall
under
these
generic
classifications--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--that
in
fact
would
be
exempt
from
the
tax.
mr.
john
steven
clark
but
they
have
not
applied
for
the
exemption,
and
so
it's
not
applied
to
them.
the
only
way
we
know
whether
they're
collecting
tax
and
remitting
is
if
they
have
asked
for
a
sales
tax
permit.
if
they
have
we
audit
them,
and
that's
the
process;
we
know
whether
they're
collecting
and
remitting
tax.
so
there
may
be
publications
that
fall
within
the
exemption,
your
honor.
there
may
be
some
that
need
to
be
taxed
and
are
not
collecting
and
remitting
taxes.
it's
just
a
failure
of
enforcement
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
john
steven
clark
under
our
sales
tax
scheme,
your
honor,
all
sale
of
tangible
personal
property
is
subject
to
tax
unless
a
benefit
is
granted
through
an
exemption.
all
persons
who
are
to
make
such
sales
must
apply
for--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--well,
your
honor,
as
i
said,
the
record
reflects
no
one
has
asked
for
that
benefit
of
that
exemption.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
if
you're
to
sell
tangible
personal
property,
you
are
to
apply
for
a
sales
tax
permit.
in
the
procedure
at
that
point
indicating
what
you
are
selling,
a
decision
would
be
made
as
to
giving
you
a
tax
permit
number
for
collecting
and
remitting
your
tax
or,
in
the
event
you
were
determined
to
be
exempt
through
the
tax
administrator's
decision,
you'd
get
a
letter
stating
such.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
he
could
be
penalized
through
civil
penalties
for
failure
to
pay
those
taxes.
mr.
john
steven
clark
he
would
not
be
penalized
for
that
conduct
for
the
publication
that
was
exempt
from
the
sales
tax
on
the
sale.
now,
that
publisher
would
be
paying
sales
tax
on
the
materials
in
the
process
of
publication,
but
not
from
the
sales
tax
of
the
sale.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
there
are
a
number
of
religious
publications
that
are
not
printed
and
published
in
arkansas,
but
circulated
there,
and
they
wouldn't
qualify
for
the
exemption.
we're
aware
of
at
least
a
couple.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
may
well
be
publications
in
arkansas
who
would
qualify
for
the
exemption,
but
just
never
have
made
application.
mr.
john
steven
clark
and
the
penalty...
there
would
be
no
penalty
assessed
in
the
sense
of
confinement
or
jailing.
and
since
they
were
exempt
from
tax--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--or
any
civil
penalty
that
would
be
assessed.
mr.
john
steven
clark
when
they
have
the
responsibility
to
collect
the
tax.
mr.
john
steven
clark
in
this
instance,
your
honor--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--your
honor,
there
are
none
that
have
applied
for
the
exemption.
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
other
than...
why
they
didn't.
i
just
know
they
didn't.
mr.
john
steven
clark
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
steven
clark
there
are
two
others.
there
are
three
totally,
the
arkansas
times
and
two
others.
mr.
john
steven
clark
for
the
arkansas
times,
$15,800.
with
the
other
one,
about
$500
or
$600
on
an
annual
event;
and
the
other
one,
also
$500
or
$600.
mr.
john
steven
clark
all
the
state
of
arkansas,
i
submit
to
this
court,
needs
to
demonstrate
is
that
there
is
some
rational
basis
for
these
four
generic
classifications
found
in
the
exemptions
granted.
a
frustration
which
i
feel
and
i
know
this
court
must
also
face
is
the
frustration
that
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
legislative
explanation
for
the
granting
of
these
exemptions
in
1948.
i
would
speculate
that
in
granting
these
exemptions
for
any
publications...
and
exemptions
were
granted,
as
i
said,
for
newspapers,
for
general
interest
publications
much
like
the
arkansas
times,
as
well
as
for
these
four
generic
types
of
publications...
that
the
purpose
behind
these
exemptions
was
to
foster
communication
in
what
is
basically
a
rural
state.
and
within
our
general
scheme
of
taxation,
that
sales
tax
is
applied,
as
i
said,
to
the
sale
of
all
tangible
personal
property.
a
comprehensive
section
of
exemptions,
however,
was
adopted
that
dealt
with
first
amendment
outlets.
as
i
mentioned
to
the
court,
for
newspapers
arkansas,
like
37
other
states,
created
an
exemption
from
sales
tax
on
the
sale
of
that
paper,
the
reason
being,
i
submit,
because
of
the
unique
means
of
distribution,
young
boys
and
young
girls,
independent
contractors,
and
the
difficulty
in
administering
and
collecting
that
tax.
the
arkansas
legislature
created
for
publications
like
newspapers
and
like
the
arkansas
times
an
exemption
from
sales
tax
on
advertising
space
sold,
which
comprises,
as
i
have
said
to
this
court,
60
to
90
percent
of
the
base
revenues
for
such
publications.
the
arkansas
times,
having
a
circulation
of
25,000
to
30,000
in
terms
of
subscription
and
sales
at
$1.75
per
volume,
simply
can't
support
itself
on
subscriptions
and
over
the
counter
sales.
that
exemption
from
that
sales
tax
on
advertising
space
sold,
which
comprises
the
bulk
of
their
operating
bases,
gives
those
type
publications
the
opportunity
to
publish
for
profit
and
foster
the
communication
and
the
information
and
ideas
that
they
would
carry.
the
four
generic
types
of
publications
enumerated
i
submit
that
the
arkansas
legislature
created
for
the
reason
that
these
types
of
publications
did
in
fact...
or
would
not
in
fact
have
anything
other
than
a
limited
advertising
base
because
of
their
specialty
of
interest.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
they
must
be
published
and
printed
within
arkansas
and
sold
by
subscription.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
a
think
a
general
sports
magazine,
the
example
being
sports
illustrated,
might
have
a
broader
base
than
one
which
deals
with
duck
hunting
or
deals
with
fox
hunting
or
deals
with
bass
fishing.
i
think
the
legislature
in
1948
contemplated
that
certain
types
of
sports
journals
would
have
a
very
limited
audience
and
a
very
limited--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor,
that
could
well
be
true.
the
legislative
motive
in
dealing
with
these
exemptions
was
to
deal
with
the
type
and
the
kind
of
publication.
it
was
not
to
deal
with
what
was
to
be
contained
in
the
articles
in
these
publications.
if
the
state
of
arkansas
had
applied
this
exemption,
for
instance,
in
the
four
generic
categories
to
only
accepted
religious
publications,
it
would
have
been
impermissible.
that's
not
the
standard.
if
the
state
of
arkansas
had
applied
the
exemption
for
advertising
space
only
to
those
publications
that
advertise
the
sales
of
cigarettes
or
liquor,
it
would
have
been
impermissible,
i
submit
to
this
court.
if
the
state
of
arkansas
had
said
to
newspapers
that
it
only
applied
the
exemption
to
sales
tax
on
the
sale
if
those
newspapers
published
a
liberal
philosophical
agenda,
that
would
not
be
permissible.
but
the
arkansas
taxing
scheme
is
not
that.
it
is
not
a
selective
exclusion
based
on
content
alone.
and
since
1948,
as
i've
stated,
we
have
no
record
of
any
publication
which
has
availed
itself
of
this
benefit.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
you
would.
these
four
generic
definitions...
i
submit
the
arkansas
general
assembly
were
struggling
and
somewhat
inartfully,
i
would
be
willing
to
admit
to
this
court,
to
come
up
with
broad
categories
of
types
of
publications,
generic
types
of
publications.
and
in
reaching
those,
it
tried
to
have
a
broad-brush
stroke
in
terms
of
application.
and
then
some
determination
is
made
by
the
tax
administrator
if
you
were
to
file
a
tax
permit
and
a
determination
is
made
of
exemption.
then
you
have
ordinary
courses
of
appeal
through
the
appellate
process
at
the
state
level
and
then
on
into
the
court
system.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
think
that
was
the
original
legislative
purpose
with
all
of
these
types
of
publications,
to
foster
this
communication
in
our
rural
state
of
the
printed
word,
whether
it
be
newspaper,
general
interest
publications,
or
these
four
generic
types
of
publications
that
might
only
have,
say,
a
limited
audience,
a
limited
advertising
base,
and
have
difficulty
in
administering
a
tax
of
$400
of
$500.
but
it
was
to
foster
that
communication.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
there
could
be.
i'm
at
a
loss
to
describe
some,
and
we
have
worked
to
try
to
describe
some,
but
feel
that
there
may
be
some
means
to
fit
those...
virtually
any
type
of
publication--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--as
i
said,
the
legislature
inartfully
drafted
this
statute.
but
in
response
to
your
question,
your
honor,
for
instance
a
how
to
do
publication
might
fit
under
trade,
in
terms
of
how
to
do
plumbing
or
how
to
do
carpentry
or
how
to
do
electrical
work.
the
contention
that--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
one
thing
that
this
court
should
consider
is
the
fact
that
this
case
might
be
ripe
for
remand
on
the
basis
that
we
have
such
an
incomplete
record,
and
that
the
arkansas
times
by
stipulation
stipulated
it
was
not
a
newspaper.
it
also
stipulated
it
was
not
one
of
these
four
generic
kinds
of
magazine,
without
a
determination
being
made
by
the
state.
it
might
well
fit
in
one
of
these
categories.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
the
arkansas
times
did
not.
it
applied
for
a
sales
tax
permit
initially,
it
began
to
collect
and
remit
the
tax,
protested
that
tax,
and
went
through
the
administrative
hearing,
went
to
the
lower
court
in
arkansas,
and
then
settled,
with
the
contingent
that
if
in
fact
this
court
or
other
courts
were
to
determine
a
different
standard
they
could
then
challenge
the
tax
again.
at
the
lower
court
hearing...
they
challenged
it
with
the
tax
administrator.
he
denied
their
exemption.
at
the
lower
court
hearing,
the
arkansas
times
stipulated,
we
are
not
a
newspaper,
we
are
not
one
of
these
four
generic
types
of
publications,
which
took
that
out
of
the
realm
of
having
some
determination
of
whether
or
not
our
tax
administrator
had
made
a
proper
determination.
then--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--well,
your
honor,
they
made
that
acknowledgment
on
their
own.
mr.
john
steven
clark
i
would
submit
to
this
court--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
general
interest
magazines
of
the
kind
of
the
washingtonian,
the
arkansas
times,
rely
in
advertising,
sale
of
advertising
space,
for
anywhere
from
60
percent
up
to
higher
percentages
in
terms
of
how
they
publish
profitably.
as
i
indicated,
the
arkansas
times
has
a
circulation
of
25
to
30,000
in
our
state,
principally
among
all
75
counties.
but
that
alone
at
$1.75
per
issue
would
not
sustain
the
publication
as
it
is
presently
published
and
distributed.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
they
would
not.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
they
would
then
be
exempt
from
sales
tax
on
the
sale,
but
they
would
not
lose
their
exemption
from
sales
tax
on
the
sale
of
advertising.
mr.
john
steven
clark
a
marginal
publication?
mr.
john
steven
clark
if
it
were
sport,
and
determined
on
these
four
generic
categories,
it
would
be
exempt
from
sales
tax
on
the
sale.
to
get
an
exemption
from
sales
tax
on
the
advertising,
your
honor...
well,
excuse
me.
if
they
sold
advertising
space,
it
would
get
that,
too,
yes.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
steven
clark
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
john
steven
clark
everyone
would
get
that,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
distinction
that
the
arkansas
general
assembly
was
attempting
to
make
in
1948
was
that
with
these
four
generic
types
of
classifications
there
might
not
be
advertising
revenue
that
could
be
generated.
mr.
john
steven
clark
that
certainly
would
have
clarified
it
some,
your
honor.
i
think
the
general
assembly
may
have
moved
away
from
that
for
fear
that
what
is
that
standard
and
how
do
you
apply
it,
what
is
substantial
advertising
revenue.
mr.
john
steven
clark
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
the
arkansas
statutory
scheme
of
general
taxation
fails,
then
45
states
like
arkansas,
i
submit,
are
at
a
loss
to
impose
a
constitutionally
approved
taxing
scheme
on
the
sale
of
any
commercial
commodities
that
have
any
ties
to
any
first
amendment
outlet.
therefore,
i
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
below
or,
in
the
alternative,
to
remand
this
case
back
to
the
arkansas
court,
since
by
virtue
of
the
appellant's
stipulation
that
they
are
not
a
newspaper
and
they're
not
one
of
the
four
generic
types
of
publications
exempted,
that
they've
precluded
a
state
determination
or
consideration
as
to
whether
they
would
fall
into
one
of
these
categories
and
they've
actually
precluded
the
state
courts
from
determining
the
parameters
of
those
exemptions.
this
court
i
believe
should
not
be
asked
to
decide
a
major
constitutional
issue
on
an
incomplete
record,
and
that
the
better
position
or
decision
would
be,
if
this
decision
cannot
be
affirmed,
would
be
for
this
court
to
exercise
restraint
and
remand
this
case
for
development
of
the
record
fully.
thank
you.
mr.
john
steven
clark
cockfighting,
yes.
i
think
that's
correct.
another
fact
that
he
mentioned
that's
not
of
the
record
and
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
fact
or
not
is
that
60
percent
or
more
of
a
publication's
revenue
is
from
advertising.
there
certainly
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
that
effect,
and
i
don't
actually
know
what
the
proportion
of
revenue
from
advertising
versus
subscription
sales
is
in
this
particular
case
or
in
the
industry
generally.
