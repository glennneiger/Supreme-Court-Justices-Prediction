chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
wilson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
wilson,
you
know,
when
we
think
of
a
discrimination
based
on
content
in
the
freedom
of
speech
area,
we
think
of
the
state
as
trying
to
suppress
or
disfavor
certain
kinds
of
content.
you
know,
maybe
communist
propaganda
or
something
like
that.
here
one
would
have
to
assume
that
the
legislature
had
it
in
for
your
kind
of
magazine
and
wanted
to
somehow
discourage
its
circulation.
and
yet,
that
just
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
very
rational
assumption.
i
mean,
do
you
think
the
legislature
was
out
to
kind
of
censor
or
suppress
your
magazine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
can
understand
that
argument.
but
when
you
go
on
and
say
it's
a
content-based
discrimination,
usually
the
reason
we
talk
about
a
content-based
discrimination
is
you
infer
from
that
that
there
was
a
desire
of
the
legislature
to
suppress
the
content
that
it's
discriminating
against.
and
i
just
don't
see
that
that
is
a
permissible
inference
here,
and
i
gather
you
agree
with
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here
you
think
the
intention
of
the
legislature
is
to
consciously
favor
religious,
professional
trade
and
sports
journals,
at
the
expense
of
other
kinds
of
journals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
look
into
some
of
these
sales
tax
laws,
i
think
you
have
a
question
in
your
mind
in
almost
every
one
of
them
as
to
how
certain
exemptions
came
to
be
on
the
books.
you
know,
maybe
there
are
amendments
on
the
floor
of
the
legislature.
you
know,
if
you
subject
them
to
any
sort
of
a
strict
scrutiny
or
even
a
fairly
rough
rational
basis
approach,
a
lot
of
them
probably
wouldn't
survive.
now,
maybe
they
shouldn't.
but
we
have
said
in
some
of
our
tax
opinions
that
the
scrutiny
on
equal
protection
in
tax
cases
is
the
least
demanding
in
any
area
of
the
law;
that
if
there's
anything
to
uphold
the
thing
it'll
be
upheld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wilson.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
general
clark.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
exemption
has
never
been
applied?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
under
arkansas
law
one
cannot
simply
read
the
statute,
if
you're
in
the
business
of
selling
tangible
personal
property,
and
say,
look,
i'm
exempt,
so
i
won't
collect
the
tax?
you
have
to
apply
for
the
exemption?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
clark,
is
the
exemption
for
religious,
professional,
trade,
and
sports
journals...
is
that
conditioned
by
the
fact
that
they're
published
in
arkansas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
argument
is
that
a
sports
magazine
would
have
a
less
general
advertising
base
than
a
general
interest
magazine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
limited
that
no
one
might
ever
try
to
publish
them,
it
sounds
like.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
clark.
ms.
wilson,
do
you
have
something
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
really
know
that,
do
you?
you
don't
know
whether,
if
you
submitted
those
arguments
to
the
state,
whether
you
might
be
able
to
get
an
exemption?
or
did
you
make
that
argument
to
the
commissioner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wilson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
three
cases

writers'

85-1385
united
states
