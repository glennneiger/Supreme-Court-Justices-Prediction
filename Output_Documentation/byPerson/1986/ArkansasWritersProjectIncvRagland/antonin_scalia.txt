justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wilson,
excuse
me.
that
same
thing
could
happen
even
if
we
rested
our
decision
on
discrimination
between
magazines
and
newspapers.
the
same
thing
could
happen.
so
it
seems
to
me
we
don't
prevent
against
that
deprivation
of
relief
by
resting
our
decision
on
the
newspaper
discrimination,
rather
than
on
the
magazine
discrimination,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor.
justice
o'connor
asked
why
couldn't...
why
do
we
have
to
reach
the
newspaper
issue
so
long
as
you're
discriminating
between
this
magazine
and
other
magazines,
isn't
that
enough?
and
you
said
yes,
it
would
be,
so
long
as
when
it
goes
back
what
happens
is
that
the
exemption
is
extended
to
your
magazine,
rather
than
the
exemption
for
other
magazines
being
eliminated,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
same
thing
could
happen
even
if
we
rested
our
decision
on
the
discrimination
between
your
magazine
and
newspapers.
likewise,
when
it
goes
back,
likewise
when
it
goes
back,
unless
we
say
something
about
it,
the
court
could
say,
instead
of
extending
the
newspaper
exemption
to
your
magazine,
we'll
eliminate
the
newspaper
exemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
that
issue
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
we
base
this
decision
on
the
magazine
exemption
or
on
the
newspaper
exemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
state
interest,
a
compelling
state
interest?
i
mean,
you'd
require
a
compelling
state
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wilson,
what
if
a
state
exempts
from
the
general
sales
tax
subscriptions
to
publications
by
charitable
organizations...
boy
scouts,
churches,
museums,
and
so
forth?
could
it
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
needs
a
compelling
state
interest
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
comfortable
with
that,
that
the
state
can't
except
the
boy
scout
publications
or
museums
publications
from
its
sales
taxes
unless
there's
a
compelling
state
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume...
you
ended
it
earlier
than
i
thought
you
would.
i
had
assumed
you
would
say
that
the
state
could
do
that
so
long
as...
without
a
compelling
state
interest,
so
long
as
it
was
not
demanding
that
the
magazine
sold
by
the
boy
scouts
have
a
particular
content.
see,
that
was
going
to
be
my
second
question.
assuming
that
you
can
say
sales
of
museum
magazines
or
boy
scout
magazines
are
okay,
could
the
state
then
say,
however,
you
can't
qualify
if
you
start
selling
time
magazine,
you
know,
published
by
the
arkansas
museum
of
art,
that
that
won't
be
allowed
if
you're
trying
to
become
a
general
purpose
publication.
but
since
you
think
that
you
can't
even
exempt
boy
scout
magazines
and
museum
magazines
at
all,
much
less
dependent
on
their
content,
i
guess
the
second
question
has
no
relevance.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
did
say
that
they
have
substantial
revenue
from
advertising?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
exempted
under
another
provision
of
arkansas
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
that
extent,
your
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
could
have
been
that
would
seem
to
indicate
that
this
is
not
one
of
those
publications
that
needs
the
kind
of
help
that
the
narrow
categories
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
much
advertising?
is
that
in
the
record,
how
much?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wilson,
could
i
ask
you
about
your
thesis
that
the
state
cannot
in
its
management
of
its
fisc,
in
either
the
imposition
of
taxes
or,
i
suppose
it
would
follow,
in
its
disbursement
of
state
funds,
favor
one
subject
over
another,
like
sports
or
what-not.
that's
essentially
your
thesis.
what
do
you
do
about,
let's
say,
the
kennedy
center,
which
receives
federal
funds?
now,
that
is
solely
subsidizing
one
form
of
speech,
right,
the
dramatic
arts?
presumably
it's
also
favoring
only
particular
subjects,
namely
the
subjects
of
the
particular
plays
and
shows
that
are
presented
at
the
kennedy
center.
now,
is
that
as
much
a
violation
of
the
constitution
as
you
say
granting
a
tax
exemption
for
sports
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
is
this
different?
could
arkansas
provide
a
subsidy
to
have
a
sporting
show
in
little
rock?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
which
there
would
be,
you
know,
speeches
and
all
the
communication
that
goes
with
that.
it's
essentially
a
communicative
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
can't
it
foster
the
sales
of
sporting
magazines
then,
if
it
wants,
so
long
as
it's
not
trying
to
stamp
out
your
magazine?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they're
not
burdening
anybody.
they're
just
granting
them
an
exemption.
you
mean
it
would
be
okay
if
they
taxed
all
of
them
and
then
gave
money
only
to
sports
publications?
that
would
be
all
right?
but
the
vice
here
is,
instead
of
collecting
the
tax
from
anybody
and
then
handing
over
some
of
it
to
sports
publications
and
the
other
ones
that
they
mention,
they
simply
short-circuited
it
and
they
said,
instead
of,
you
know,
having
it
come
back
in
and
out,
just
don't
pay
the
tax?
that's
what's
wrong?
but
they
could
have
done
the
same
thing
had
they
imposed
the
tax
generally
and
then
distributed
a
subsidy?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
a
particular
point
of
view,
a
particular
subject:
sports,
i
don't
know,
politics.
the
federal
government
requires
special
provisions
to
be
made
for
matters
of
public
interest
by
radio
and
television
stations.
isn't
that
content
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
general
tax.
it's
not
a
tax
just
on
your
company.
what
they
have
given
is
a
benefit
to
some
special
magazines.
