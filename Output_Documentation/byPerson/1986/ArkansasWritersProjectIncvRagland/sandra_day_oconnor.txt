while
we're
on
the
subject
of
the
lower
court's
holding,
i
think
that
i
understand
the
lower
courts
here
to
have
held
that
under
arkansas
law
even
the
non-subscription
sales
of
these
so-called
exempt
magazines
are
exempt?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
doesn't
turn
an
whether
the
sale
is
by
way
of
subscription
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
wilson,
i
guess
we
don't
even
have
to
look
at
the
newspaper
question
if
we
focus
on
just
the
particular
types
of
magazines
that
are
exempt.
presumably
we
could
answer
this
case
by
answering
that
question
alone,
quite
apart
from
the
newspaper
exemption
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
wilson,
you
argue
that
the
legislature
in
its
sales
tax
cannot
distinguish
between
magazines
and
newspapers.
now,
if
that
proposition
is
correct,
then
would
it
mean,
for
example,
that
books
have
to
be
exempt
because
magazines
are,
or
that
videotapes
have
to
be
because
magazines
are?
theater
tickets?
how
far
do
we
go?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we're
asking
about
the
legal
standard.
does
it
have
to
be
a
compelling
state
interest
or
just
a
rational
basis
for
the
distinction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
court
has
traditionally
given
a
great
deal
of
leeway,
has
it
not,
to
state
taxing
schemes
and
to
let
the
state
distinguish
among
objects
of
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
did
minneapolis
star
indicate
that
a
general
sales
tax
would
be
different,
and
that
we
wouldn't
have
the
same
concerns?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
the
price
and
frequency
and
the
volume
of
newspaper
sales
in
general
is
different
from
that
of
magazines,
and
that
that
difference
might
justify
the
difference
in
the
tax
application?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
clark,
the
statute,
though,
does
seem
to
prefer
certain
journals...
sports,
religious,
professional,
and
trade
journals...
on
the
basis
of
their
content,
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
we
talk
about
the
exemption
of
certain
types
of
journals,
please?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
a
type
of
content-based
treatment?
it's
only
journals
dealing
with
sports
and
religious
matters
and
trade
and
professional
journals
that
qualify
for
the
exemption?
