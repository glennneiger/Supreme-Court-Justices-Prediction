ms.
anne
owings
wilson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
which
upheld
the
validity
of
the
application
of
the
arkansas
sales
tax
to
sales
of
arkansas
times
magazine
when
newspapers
and
certain
types
of
magazines
are
exempt
from
taxation.
the
arkansas
times
magazine
is
a
monthly
city
and
regional
type
of
magazine,
very
similar
to
this
city's
washingtonian.
it's
distributed
throughout
the
state
of
arkansas,
has
a
distribution
of
between
25
and
30,000,
four
fifths
of
which
are
through
subscription
sales.
it
has
articles
on
a
variety
of
topics.
it
has
short
stories,
articles
on
politics,
religion,
fashions,
food,
leisure
activities,
other
articles
of
that
type.
it
does
have
articles
on
sports,
religion,
professional
things,
and
so
forth,
and
i
mention
that
particularly
because
that's
one
category
of
publications
that
the
arkansas
sales
tax
exempts
from
taxation.
there
are
two
exemptions.
first
of
all,
the
arkansas
sales
tax
is
imposed
generally
on
sales
of
tangible
personal
property.
there
are
two
exemptions
which
are
particularly
apropos.
one
is
exemption
(f),
which
exempts
all
gross
receipts
or
gross
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
newspapers.
the
other
one
is
exemption
(j),
which
exempts
religious,
professional,
trade,
and
sports
journals,
and/or
publications
printed
and
published
within
the
state
when
sold
through
regular
subscriptions.
now,
just
from
reading
exemption
(j)
one
would
think
that
that
might
extent
to
cover
all
publications
printed
and
published
within
the
state
of
arkansas,
and
in
fact
that's
what
the
chancellor
who
first
heard
the
case
found.
but
the
department
of
revenue
appealed
the
case
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
and
the
arkansas
supreme
court
construed
exemption
(j)
extremely
narrowly,
finding
that
it
only
exempted
sales
of
religious,
sports,
professional,
and
trade
journals.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
that's
right.
he
found
that
the
words
"when
sold
through
regular
subscriptions"
were
words
of
description
rather
than
limitation,
and
that
since
arkansas
times
was
a
publication
that
was
regularly
sold
through
subscriptions
that
all
sales
of
arkansas
times
magazine
were
exempt
from
taxation.
it
is
our
contention
that,
because
newspapers
are
exempt
from
taxation
and
because
these
other
very
specific
types
of
publications
are
exempt
from
publication,
that
sales
of
arkansas
times
should
also
be
exempt
from
publications
or
that
the
other
publications
should
be
taxed,
that
there
should
not
be
discrimination.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
that
is
correct
if
the
remedy
were
necessarily
to
be
to
extend
the
exemption
to
sales
of
arkansas
times
magazine.
but
if
the
case
went
back
to
arkansas
courts
and
the
court
found
that,
rather
than
extending
that
exemption,
that
it
would
simply
delete
it
and
tax
all
sales
of
magazines
regardless
of
content,
there
would
still
be
discrimination
between
magazines
and
newspapers.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
any
distinctions
that
exist
between
newspapers
and
magazines
are
constitutionally
invalid
and--
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
that's
right.
so
long
as--
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
--that
is
correct.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
well,
again,
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
the
discrimination
between
newspapers
and
magazines
was
unconstitutional
and
the
arkansas
court
then
found
that
the
remedy
was
to
delete
the
exemption,
the
result
would
be
that
all
publications
would
be
treated
the
same,
whether
they
be
newspapers
or
magazines
or
sports
journals
or
whatever,
and
that
would
end
the
discrimination
and
we'd
have
a
constitutional
result
at
that
time.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
or
not.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
that...
yes,
i
think
to
bring
us
even
we
would
have
to
get
a
refund
of
past
taxes.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
no,
not
as
to
the
taxes
collected
up
through
the
time
of
the
decision,
that's
correct.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
the
discrimination
obviously
in
the
magazine
exemption
and
also
in
the
newspaper
exemption
is
based
almost
entirely
on
content.
it's
based
entirely
on
content
when
the
state
favors
sports
journals,
religious
journals,
and
so
forth.
it's
based
primarily
on
content--
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
--no.
on
the
contrary,
just
the
timing
of
it
shows
that
it's
not,
because
the
arkansas
times
didn't
even
begin
publication
until
some
years
after
these
exemptions
were
in
effect.
nevertheless,
it
is
discriminated
against,
regardless
of
the
purpose
of
the
legislature
and
regardless
of
whether
it
was
trying,
deliberately
trying,
to
suppress
this
kind
of
speech.
it
does
burden
the
arkansas
times
magazine
where
other
types
of
publications
are
not
burdened.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
well,
the
recent
cases
that
the
court
has
decided
where
there
was
content-based
discrimination
were
really
not
cases
where
the
government
was
trying
to
suppress
a
particular
point
of
view
or
anything
of
that
sort.
on
the
contrary,
the
government
in
each
case
was
really
trying
to
favor
one
particular
type
of
speech.
as
in
carey
versus
brown,
the
government
was
trying
to
favor
any
type
of
picketing
related
to
labor
issues.
the
same
thing
in
moseley
versus
city
of
chicago,
and
that
was
found
to
be
content-based
discrimination,
even
though
the
purpose
of
the
government
in
each
case
was
to
favor
the
labor
picketing
and
not
to,
particularly
to
suppress
the...
well,
of
course,
the
intent
was
to
suppress
everything
but
the
labor
picketing.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
that's
what
the
arkansas
supreme
court
found
when
it
decided
the
case,
that's
correct.
we
don't
have...
i
don't
know
why
the
legislature
wanted
to
favor
those,
and
the
state
has
not
given
any
reason
why
those
particular
types
of
publications
would
be
favored.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
well,
that's
certainly
true
with
things
which
don't...
with
taxing
statutes
which
don't
involve
first
amendment
rights.
but
when
first
amendment
rights
have
been
implicated,
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
has
been
applied,
as
in
the
case,
the
minneapolis
star
case,
being
the
most
apropos
recent
case.
but
the
court
has
not
applied
the
rational
basis
standard
to
taxes
which
implicate
fundamental
freedoms,
such
as
the
right
to
speech
and
the
press.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
it's
possible
that
the
state
could
assert
some
interest
that
would
justify
a
discrimination
between
videotapes,
for
example,
and
newspapers.
i
don't
know
whether
it
could
or
not.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
interest
the
state
could
show
in
that
type
of
discrimination.
i
have
some
doubts
as
to
whether--
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
--i
think
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
tax,
how
general
the
tax
is,
you
know,
the
nature
of
the
exemptions,
and
many
other
factors.
i
don't...
i
think
generally
it's
the
compelling
interest.
where
the
first
amendment
rights
are
implicated,
it
has
to
be
the
compelling
interest.
and
i
would
think
it
would
be
unlikely
that
a
state
could
show
that
there
was
a
compelling
interest
in
that
type
of--
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
except
in
the
area
where
it
has
burdened
first
amendment
rights.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
minneapolis
star
did
indicate
that
a
general
sales
tax
could
be
generally
applied
to
publications,
as
to
all
other
items
of
commerce.
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
tax
is
not
applied
generally
to
items
of
commerce
anyway,
and
it's
certainly
not
applied
generally
to
publications.
the
state
picks
and
chooses
between
publications
in
applying
this
tax.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
the
state
has
not
shown
any
information
whatsoever
concerning
the
volume
and
so
forth
of
newspapers.
it
has
asserted
an
interest
in
raising
taxes.
and
to
me
it
seems
that
the
most
effective
way
for
it
to
increase
its
tax
revenues
would
be
to
tax
everything
generally,
including
newspapers
and
other
publications.
again,
this
is
not
a
general
tax
in
arkansas.
it's...
as
to
publications,
it's
a
very
special
tax.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
that
type
of
publication,
it
might
be
able
to
show
that
the
state
had
an
interest
which
was
strong
enough
to
justify
the
discrimination.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
well,
yes,
i
think
it
does
need...
either
a
compelling
state
interest
or
to
have
some
other
rights
implicated,
such
as
possibly
religious,
the
right
to
religious
freedom
or
something
of
that
sort?
it
might
be
able
to
present
a
strong
argument.
but
the
general
standard--
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
--that
would
be
the
general
principle,
your
honor,
unless
they
could
assert
an
interest
which
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
discrimination.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
okay,
you
mean
just
generally,
like
exempting
charities
from
property
tax?
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
court
has
to...
that
if
it
exempts
anything,
it
has
to
also
exempt
the
press.
i
think
that,
you
know,
in
most
states
churches
and
so
forth
are
exempt
from
property
tax
and
publications
are
not
exempt
from
property
tax.
but
it
would
be
improper
for--
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
--exempt
the
sale
of
a
church
or
something?
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
well,
it
might
be
able
to
do
that.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
i
would
say
that
it
should
be
scrutinized
closely,
yes.
but
the
normal
rationale
for
charities
is
that
they
provide
services
that
the
state
would
otherwise
have
to
provide
and
things
of
that
sort.
so
you
know,
the
state
can
frequently
justify
an
exemption
for
a
charity
which
it
possibly
couldn't
justify
otherwise.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
no,
i
really
wouldn't
say
that.
i
would
say
that
if
you
had
a
truly
generally
applicable
sales
tax
which
exempted
a
very
narrow
classification
of
publications
that
the
state
had
identified
as
being
particularly
in
the
public
interest
or
of
the
type
that
particularly
should
not
be
taxed,
then
i
don't
think
the
same
constitutional
arguments
would
apply.
but
here
we
have
a
situation
where
nearly
all
periodical
publications
in
arkansas
are
exempt
from
publications,
with
at
the
time
that
this
went
to
trial
possibly
the
single
exemption
of
arkansas
times
magazine.
it
seemed
to
at
that
time
be
the
only
publication
subject
to
sales
tax
on
any
topic.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
yes,
if
it
please
the
court.
attorney
general
clark
did
make
reference
to
a
number
of
facts
which
are
not
in
the
record,
and
i
did
want
to
bring
them
to
your
attention.
one
is
he
stated
that
there
are
two
other
publications
in
the
state
of
arkansas
that
also
have
paid
sales
tax.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
and
i
don't
know
where
that
came
from.
i
don't
know
which
publications
those
could
be.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
yes.
i
think,
though,
that...
i
mean,
if
there
are
two
publications,
i
think
the
situation
was
that
one
of
them
was
taxable,
admittedly
taxable,
but
it
hadn't
had
any
revenue,
so
it
hadn't
actually
paid
tax.
the
other
i
believe
was
a
cockfighting
magazine,
which
would
have
fit
under
the
sports
exemption.
and
i
really
think
that
the
taxes
that
it
paid
were
on
sales
of
cocks
and
cockfighting
paraphernalia
and
not
on
the
publications.
but
i
don't
know,
because
the
record
was
never
developed
on
that
point.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
well,
the
court
has
made
a
distinction
between
subsidies
of
that
sort
versus
classifications
which
burden
types
of
speech.
and
probably
the
best
example
of
each
of
those
is
regan
versus
taxation
with
representation
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
regan
versus
time,
inc.,
where
the
court
found
that
the
government
could
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
the
type
of
content
in
allowing
publications
to
publish
pictures
of
dollar
bills
in
that
case.
and
in
regan
versus
taxation
with
representation,
where
organizations
which
engaged
in
lobbying
were
denied
501(c)(3)
exemptions,
the
court
in
that
case
found
that
that
type
of
benefit
was
not
subject
to
a
compelling
state
interest,
but
rather
to
a
rational
basis,
and
that
the
government
could
provide
subsidies
for
the
kennedy
center,
the
smithsonian
institute,
things
of
that
sort.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
yes,
i
think
it
could,
yes.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
certainly.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
well,
it
probably
does
subsidize
the
razorback
magazine
or
something
like
that,
in
that
there
is
probably
a
sports
publication
at
the
university
of
arkansas
which
is
subsidized
by
the
state.
the
state
subsidizes
student
newspapers
and
things
of
that
sort.
it's
a
very
common
thing
to
do
that,
and
that's
certainly
very
different
from
something
which
burdens
people,
you
know,
that
are
similarly
situated,
people
in
the
same
marketplace.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
well,
i
think
a
systematic
program
of
the
government
where
it
systematically
favored
publications
that
espoused
a
particular
point
of
view
and
then
denied
the
same
benefits--
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
--well,
again,
it's
an
enhancement
rather
than
a
burden
on
some
elements
of
speech.
it's
really
just...
it's
just
a
different
classification
of...
you
know,
there's
kind
of
two
lines
of
cases,
and
one
is
where
the
government
is
allowed
to
enhance,
you
know,
something
like
the
smithsonian
or
the
veterans
organizations
in
regan
versus
taxation
with
representation;
and
on
the
other
where
it
burdens
one
element
of
the
press
versus
another,
as
in
minneapolis,
as
in
the
minneapolis
star
case.
this
really
falls
clearly
into
the
areas
where
the
government
has
sought
to
distinguish,
to
burden,
one
speaker
and
allow
another
not
to
be
burdened.
i
don't
think--
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
--well,
of
course,
the
benefits
that
they've
granted
are
such
that
i
still
assert
one
publication
is
singled
out
for
taxation,
where
every
other
publication
is
exempt
from
taxation.
one
thing
i
wanted
to
mention
that's
just
an
example
of
how,
well,
really
irrational
these
classifications
are
is
again,
you
know,
who
decides
what
a
trade
publication
is?
i
guess
the
state
of
arkansas
does,
some
official
with
the
department
of
finance
and
administration.
take
a
computer
publication.
some
people
use
computers
in
connection
with
their
hobbies
and
some
people
use
computers
in
connection
with
their
trade
or
business.
now,
should
a
computer
magazine
get
an
affidavit
from
a
subscriber
as
to
whether
he
is
purchasing
it
for
his
trade
or
purchasing
it
for
his
hobby?
you
know,
and
of
course
in
the
sports
category,
arkansas
times
publishes
plenty
of
articles
about
sports;
it
publishes
religious
articles.
because
it
doesn't
publish
enough
religious
articles,
the
state
wouldn't
classify
it
as
a
religious
publication.
ms.
anne
owings
wilson
we
did
not
argue
that
it
was
a
religious
publication
or
a
sports
publication,
no,
your
honor.
we
stipulated
with
the
state
that
it
was
not
any
one
of
those
four
classifications
and
that
it
was
not
a
newspaper.
and
i
might
add
in
that
regard,
the
state
now
wishes
the
case
remanded
for
development
of
further
facts.
that
was
a
joint
stipulation
that
was
agreed
to.
both
sides
felt
that
all
the
facts
that
were
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide
the
case
were
in
the
record.
and
the
facts
as
they
are
in
the
record
do
clearly
show
that
the
state
had
no
interest
and
no
justification
in
making
the
distinctions
that
it's
made
in
taxing
publications.
if
