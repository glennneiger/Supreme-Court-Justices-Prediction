justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
ford,
are
you
urging
the
applicability
of
the
hague
convention?
i
admire
your
statesmanship
in
backing
off
from
the
position
that
it
is
exclusive
and
you
must
use
it,
but
once
you
back
off
of
that
position,
what
is
left
other
than
the
doctrine
of
comity?
but
we
didn't
need
the
hague
convention
for
the
doctrine
of
comity.
that
presumably
existed
before
the
hague
convention
was
even
entered
into.
and
i
don't
see
why
the
obligation
of
a
federal
court
to
consider
the
sensitivities
of
foreign
governments
is
increased
a
whit
by
the
existence
of
the
hague
convention
from
what
it
was
before
that
was
adopted.
so
how
is
the
hague
convention
a
part
of
your
argument
any
more?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
what
imposes
that
rule?
where
does
that
rule
come
from?
it
doesn't
come
from
the
hague
convention,
if
the
hague
convention
is
not
exclusive.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
which
would
have
existed
before
the
hague
convention,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
can
just
stop
talking
about
the
hague
convention.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
we
are
discussing
is
whether
as
a
matter
of
comity
american
courts
should
generally
not
conduct
discovery
abroad,
or
not
permit
discovery
to
be
conducted
abroad.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand...
if
i
understood
your
response
to
justice
o'connor
correctly,
it
isn't
a
first
use
rule.
or
if
it
is
a
first
use
rule
it
is
substantially
different
from
what
the
solicitor
general
is
proposing.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
you
think
that
you
always
must
do
it
first,
or
generally
must
do
it
first?
what
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--always?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
would
be
so
even
though
it
has
become
clear
from
the
past
experience
of
a
particular
federal
court
or
of
all
the
federal
courts
or
state
courts
that
a
particular
country,
a
particular
signatory
to
the
convention
in
fact
has
not
permitted
these
procedures
to
be
used
properly?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question,
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question?
what
if
you
do
have
such
experience?
does
your
first
use
rule
still
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
isn't
absolute
first
use
rule.
a
court
can
use
some
factors
to
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
am
trying
to
understand
what
your
position
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
as
experience
warrants.
what
other
exceptions
might
there
be
besides
the
fact
that
we
know
that
a
particular
foreign
country
won't
in
fact
allow
these
procedures
to
be
used
properly?
anything
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
reason
of
the
hague
convention,
or
by
reason
of
some
other
principle?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
hague
convention.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
your
current
position
have
anything
to
do
with
the
hague
convention?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
either
the
hague
convention
is
mandatory,
in
which
case
you
use
it,
or
it
is
not
mandatory,
and
all
it
does
is
supplement
the
procedures
that
countries
have
to
make
information
available
abroad,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
either
one
or
the
other,
and
if
it
is
the
latter,
then
i
don't
see
why
it
creates
a
new
rule
of
comity
that
didn't
exist
before.
it
mainly
alters
the
procedures
in
the
civil
law
countries,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
didn't
we
use
comity
before
with
respect
to
england?
are
you
aware
of
any
federal
court
that
felt
compelled
in
a
discovery
matter
to
withhold
action
until
use
of
the
british
internal
procedures
for
obtaining
the
information
was
resorted
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
that
it
has
to
be
adopted
by
the
french
legislature
in
order
to
be
binding
in
france?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
hague
convention
have
to
do
with
that?
suppose
france
had
a
blocking
statute
and
the
hague
convention
didn't
exist.
in
that
situation
do
you
think
the
district
court
would
have
no
obligation
to
consider
the
situation
it
was
putting
the
litigant
in
by
compelling
information
to
be
handed
over
where
perhaps
some
other
means
could
be
devised?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
inapplicability
of
the
hague
statute
is
really
irrelevant.
even
if
we
accept
your
position
that
maybe
a
particular
procedure
in
the
hague
convention
was
not
usable,
the
district
court
should
still
consider
when
it
is
dealing
with
a
foreign
litigant
what
kind
of
a
situation
its
discovery
order
is
putting
him
in,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
argument
about
the
applicability
of
the
hague
convention
merely
goes
to
the
manner
in
which
the
comity
decision
should
be
made.
it
doesn't
go
to
whether
you
make
any
kind
of
a
comity
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
even
under
your
theory
you
can't
get
equality.
i
mean,
you
acknowledge
that
you
can't
take
depositions
in
france
under
the
federal
rules,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
no
way
to
get
parity.
