justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
there
is
insufficient
experience
to
show
that
these
requests
just
aren't
going
to
be
honored,
and
you
say,
well,
then
the
american
court
has...
can
recognize
an
exception.
what
is
it
supposed
to
do
when
it
recognizes
the
exception,
order
the
party
to
produce
the
documents?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
it
makes
it,
and
it
says
we
need
the
documents.
may
it
order
the
party
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
it
is
against
the
law
for
the
party
to
produce
them--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
the
home
state,
in
the
home
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
court
ever
order
the
party
to
produce
the
documents
if
it
is
against
the
law,
say,
of
france
to
produce
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
a
perfectly
fair
position,
and
even
if
comity
wouldn't
have
required
resorting
to
foreign
mechanisms
in
the
first
instance,
it
is
perfectly
fair
to
argue
that
the
hague
convention
does
require
it,
no
matter
what
comity
would
have
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
why
do
you?
why
do
you
say
that
the
hague
convention
does
not
require
first
resort?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
just
requires
first
resort
i
am
not
so
sure
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
construe,
if
we
say
that
the
hague
convention
does
not
require
exclusive
use
or
first
resort,
do
we
have
to
decide
anything
else?
do
we
have
to
get
into
comity?
or
is
the
only
issue
here
the
effect
of
the
hague
convention?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
are
requiring
the
documents
to
be
brought
from
france.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
france
believes
that
the
hague
convention
covers
the
production
of
these
documents.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that
the
case
has
to
go
back,
doesn't
it,
to
see
if
there
are
some
grounds
for
an
exception?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
court
below
agree
with
you
that
the
hague
convention
just
didn't
reach
these
documents?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
also
say,
even
if
it...
even
if
it...
even
if
it
applies
there
is
an
exception?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
your
opponents
to
say
that
if
an
american
plaintiff
wants
to
take
the
deposition
of
a
french
national
and
the
french
national
is
completely
willing
to
have
his
deposition
taken
on
french
soil,
that
you
have
to
go
through
some
official
authority
have
it
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
it
the
defendants
in
this
case
had
said,
well,
we
are
quite
willing
to
furnish
these
documents,
is
it
their
position
that
the
hague
convention,
wholly
aside
from
the
blocking
statute,
would
prevent
them
from
doing
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
could
these
defendants
simply
have
produced
the
documents
without
complying
with
any...
without
regard
to
the
hague
convention?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
your
opponents
say
that
the
hague
convention
would
forbid
them
from
just
voluntarily
producing
the
documents?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
