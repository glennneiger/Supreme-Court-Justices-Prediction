chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-1695,
societe
nationale
industrielle,
et
cetera,
versus
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
iowa.
mr.
ford,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ford.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
congress
in
so
many
words
said,
you
will
resort
to
the
hague
convention
in
federal
cases
and
you
will
not
do
otherwise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we
are
just
talking
basically
about
how
stringent
the
provisions
of
the
hague
convention
are,
you
know,
what
impetus
congress
gave
or
the
executive
gave
to
require
some
sort
of
use
of
it
before
you
get
to
ordinary
discovery
proceedings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
doyle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
french
lawyer
goes
to
france
representing
the
french
company
and
he
is
subject
to
some
sort
of
sanctions
by
the
french
government
because
he
is
attempting
to
comply
with
the
district
court
discovery
order?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
district
court
can
focus
solely
on
the
concerns
of
the
litigants
before
it
to
get
information
pertinent
to
their
lawsuit
and
ignore
foreign
policy
considerations
in
making
this
sort
of
a
determination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
it
is
not
applicable,
you
are
saying,
i
take
it,
not
that
it
would
not
be
available
if
you
chose
to
use
it,
but
that
by
its
terms
it
is
not
required
to
be
used?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
presumably
you
could
waive
any
procedures
required
by
the
hague
convention
voluntarily
like
any
other
procedures,
can't
you?
you
can
say,
we
are
not
going
to
have
to
go
through
a
discovery
motion.
i
will
produce
this.
you
can
do
that
in
this
case
like
anything
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
doyle.
mr.
ford,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ford.
the
case
is
submitted.
