justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ford,
as
i
understand
it,
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
agree
that
it
has
to
always
be
resorted
to
in
the
first
instance,
does
he?
how
does
your
position
now
differ
from
that
of
the
solicitor
general,
would
you
say?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
wouldn't
necessarily
require
a
resort
to
the
hague
procedures
in
the
first
instance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
i
understand
it
it
would
not
under
his
view,
at
least,
require
resort
in
the
first
instance
to
the
hague
procedures--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--necessarily.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
is
your
position
on
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
what
other
procedures
can
accommodate
a
plaintiff's
needs?
for
example,
does
your
client,
being
a
foreign
national,
should
your
client
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
what
accommodation
should
be
made,
if
any?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
foreign
national
is
going
to
know
what
the
procedures
are
in
that
country
better
than
the
american
litigant,
presumably,
and
you
don't
think
there
should
be
any
burden
on
the
foreign
national,
at
least,
to
go
forward
and
establish
what
the
procedures
are
which
are
available
in
the
foreign
country?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ford,
for
example,
haven't
some
countries
party
to
the
convention
made
an
article
23
reservation
so
that,
for
example,
documents
will
not
be...
requests
for
documents
will
not
be
honored.
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
is
an
american
court
to
do
when
a
party
plaintiff,
for
example,
is
seeking
production
of
documents
that
are
in
a
country
with
an
article
23
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
am
asking
under
your
proposal
what
is
it
the
american
court
would
have
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
know
the
meaning,
and
the
country
simply
will
not
permit
the
production
of
documents.
now,
what
is
the
court
to
do
under
your
version?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
position
of
france
today
in
honoring
requests
for
documents
that
are
relevant
to
the
litigation
in
this
country?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
aware
of
any
such
requests
being
made
through
american
courts
since
that
letter
was
issued?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
mr.
minear,
the
sg
appears
to
have
changed
his
position
regarding
the
use
of
the
hague
convention.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
reread
the
briefs
filed
by
the
sg,
and
it
certainly
appears
that
way
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
as
to
the
taking
of
depositions
do
you
adhere
to
the
position
that
the
hague
convention
procedures
are
exclusive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
in
france,
for
example,
in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
minear,
does
the
fact
that
this
country
has
entered
into
the
hague
convention
now
weigh
in
the
comity
balance?
is
it
now
a
factor
in
the
comity
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
is
one
of
the
issues
we
have
to
resolve.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
even
if
the
court
were...
even
if
we
were
to
decide
it
isn't
exclusive,
do
you
think
that
a
trial
court
has
no
obligation
to
consider
whether
convention
procedures
could
be
followed
in
obtaining
the
requested
discovery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why?
you
don't
think
that
the
united
states
interests
in
getting
information
might
be
affected
by
international
concerns
to
a
degree
that
the
court
should
consider
that
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
disagree
with
the
court
below
on
that
point
and
believe
that
if
the
document
is
presently
on
foreign
soil
and
has
to
be
taken
from
there
to
be
produced
here,
and
if
we
think
that
is
something
that
would
trigger
the
hague
convention
as
a
possible
procedure
to
use,
then
must
the
trial
court
not
think
about
these
international
concerns?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
now
we
have
the
letter
from
the
foreign
minister
indicating
possible
availability
of
the
procedure,
do
we
not?
