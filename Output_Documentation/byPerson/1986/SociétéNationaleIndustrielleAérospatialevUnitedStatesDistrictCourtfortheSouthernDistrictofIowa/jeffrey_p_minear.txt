mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
united
states
agrees
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
the
hague
evidence
convention
has
no
application
in
this
case.
we
do
not
agree,
however,
that
this
court
should
adopt
a
general
first
use
rule
in
using
the
convention.
instead,
the
determination
whether
to
use
the
convention
should
be
made
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
the
judgment
below
should
therefore
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
really
accurate.
the
first
case
in
which
this
issue
arose--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--you
are
referring
to
the
brief
that
we
filed
in
falzon.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
falzon
dealt
with
the
problem
of
oral
depositions
on
foreign
soil.
the
united
states
adheres
to
the
position
that
those
depositions
are
improper
without
the
consent
of
the
foreign
nation.
however,
this
matter
concerns
strictly
the
production
of
documents
and
interrogatories,
and
in
that
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
no,
we
do
not,
your
honor.
there
is
a
statement
on
page
6
of
the
falzon
brief
that
mentioned
exclusivity,
which
said
strictly
within
the
confines
of
depositions
on
foreign
soil.
we
still
believe
that
depositions
could
be
taken
in
the
united
states
without
violation
of
a
nation's
judicial
sovereignty.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
by
reason
of
what
we
believe
is
customary
international
law
that
the
general
view
of
foreign
nations
is
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
their
sovereignty,
and
the
united
states
is
willing
to
honor
that
viewpoint
even
though
we
might
not
necessarily
agree
with
it
fully.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
that
would
be
quite
apart
from
the
hague
convention.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
problem
here,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
prior
to
the
formulation
of
the
hague
convention
these
issues
typically
arose
in
the
case
of
depositions
that
were
to
take
place
on
foreign
soil.
in
a
number
of
cases
american
litigants
simply
went
to
the
foreign
country
and
attempted
to
take
depositions,
and
this,
in
fact,
was
what
the
genesis
for
the
convention
was.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
for
the
most
part
they
were.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
it
weighs
in
in
this
way,
that
the
foreign
nations
generally
view
the
hague
convention
as
exclusive.
the
united
states'
view
is
that
this
supplements
american
procedures
for
obtaining
evidence.
it
does
impose
obligations
on
the
united
states
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
particularly
as
a
receiving
state.
we
now
have
to
meet
the
minimum
requirements
for
providing
evidence
to
foreign
countries,
and
they
do
likewise.
but
with
respect
to
the
comity
analysis
the
conflict
right
now
exists
in
the
fact
that
we
view
this
as
a
supplemental
matter
and
that
parties
in
the
united
states
can
typically
choose
among
the
discovery
methods
they
might
use.
the
respondents
here
are
free
to
use
the
convention
if
they
wish
under
american
laws
but
they
are
not
mandated
to
do
so.
this
is
where
the
conflict
arises,
and
this
is
why
there
is
a
need
for
a
comity
type
of
analysis.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
again,
justice
marshall,
the
things
that
we
must
do
is,
we
must
provide
the
evidence
as
specified
when
a
foreign
nation
requests
it.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
but
the
hague
convention
says
that
requests
for
foreign--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--as
a
receiving
state
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
but
it
only
provides
a
supplement--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
yes,
the
treaty
is
mandatory
insofar
as
we
must
provide
evidence
to
foreign
countries.
now,
a
court
adjudicating
a
transnational
dispute
is
faced
with
a
choice
of
employing
the
hague
convention,
using
traditional
american
discovery
methods,
or
a
combination
of
both
methods.
petitioners
contend
that
the
court
must
always
choose
the
convention,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
to
obtain
any
foreign
evidence.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
disagree.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
our
view
is,
first
of
all,
there
is
nothing
in
the
convention
that
indicates
a
first
use
requirement,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
ratification
history
that
indicates
a
first
use
requirement
as
well,
but
furthermore
petitioner's
rule
rests
on
the
assumption
that
the
hague
convention
will
always
produce
fair,
effective,
and
efficient
discovery,
and
that
is
a
matter
that
is
subject
to
considerable
debate.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
the
problem
here
is
a
domestic
plaintiff
who
is
forced
to
go
through
first
resort
to
the
convention
may
in
fact
encounter
so
many
obstacles
that
he
is
forced
to
give
up
his
lawsuit.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
then
that
would
be
controlling.
there
would
be
no
doubt
that
if
congress
in
fact
made
that
declaration
explicit--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
record
here
is
rather
unclear,
quite
frankly,
on
to
what
extent
congress
expected
these
matters
to
be
used
even
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
believe
that
the
court
should
identify
those
principles
that
should
control
the
comity
analysis.
for
instance,
we
think
it
is
important
that
a
foreign
nation
identify
the
foreign
interest,
the
reason
why
the
use
of
the
hague
convention
is
necessary
within
its
country.
we
also
believe
the
court
should
stress--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
statement
that
a
foreign
nation
objects,
and
being
able
to
point
to
specific
policies
of
the
foreign
nation
we
believe
will
generally
suffice
to
show
that
there
is
a
legitimate
foreign
interest
here.
now,
some
foreign
interests
are
entitled
to
greater
weight
or
greater
comity
than
perhaps
other
interests.
for
instance,
we
believe
that
the
court
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
privacy
interests
of
a
nation,
for
instance,
trade
secret
laws
require
use
of
the
hague
convention.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
yes,
your
honor,
and
this
brings
up
another
problem.
these
issues
are
typically
arising
in
the
context
of
protective
orders,
and
in
fact
there
is
a
mechanism,
the
federal
rules.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
now,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
record
that
should
be
created,
we
believe
the
petitioners
do
have
an
obligation
of
some
sort
to
explain
how
their
law
works
and
whether
or
not
the
discovery
could
be
obtained
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
case
should
be
vacated
and
remanded
for
a
fuller
comity
analysis.
we
do
not
believe
the
record
here
is
really
adequate
to
conduct
the
sort
of
comity
analysis
that
we
are
discussing.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
this
case
it
is
difficult
to
speak
of
burdens
in
this
situation.
instead--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
believe
that
the
domestic
litigant
has
an
obligation
to
identify
the
types
of
discovery
that
it
feels
is
necessary.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
in
return
petitioner
should
indicate
or
the
foreign
litigant
should
indicate
whether
or
not
this
discovery
could
be
obtained
through
the
use
of
the
convention.
they
are
in
the
best
position
to
provide
that
sort
of
information.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
may
i
answer
that
question?
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
our
view
is
that
societe
internationale
v.
rogers
controls
that
inquiry.
in
some
situations
it
may
be
appropriate
for
a
district
court
to
order
production
even
though
it
might
violate
a
foreign
law.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well
first
of
all,
there
is
a
real
question
whether
or
not
these
laws
are
in
fact
being
applied
to
french
citizens.
there
is
a
question
of
whether--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
