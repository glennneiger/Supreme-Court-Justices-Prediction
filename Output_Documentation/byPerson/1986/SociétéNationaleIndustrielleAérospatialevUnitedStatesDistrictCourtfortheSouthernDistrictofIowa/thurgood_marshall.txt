justice
thurgood

we
are
not
resorting
to
it,
we
are
bound
by
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
resorting
to
it.
we
are
bound
by
it.
the
constitution
says
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
understand
what
the
case
is
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
get
a
treaty
and
comity?
treaty
is
the
opposite
of
comity.
treaty
is,
you
must
do
you
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
must
follow
the
hague
convention,
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
mean
there
is
no
comity
involved.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
treaty,
the
constitution
says
a
treaty
is
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
binds
everybody,
including
us
and
the
department
of
justice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
are
you
going
to
order
somebody
to
violate
the
laws
of
france?
justice
thurgood
marshall
go
right
ahead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
get
a
man
arrested
and
convicted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
and
your
court
are
not
going
to
determine
what
the
law
of
france
is
when
they
put
him
in
jail.
france
is
going
to
decide
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
while
you
are
speculating,
what
happens
if
this
court,
a
district
court
here
orders
this
man
to
go
over
there
and
get
these
documents,
and
france
locks
him
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
that
help
him
over
there?
how
does
that
help
him
out
of
the
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
feel
sorry
for
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
you
voluntarily
turn
them
over,
you
are
in
trouble
with
france.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
as
you
read
the
statute
or
the
treaty,
and
you
turn
them
over
voluntarily,
wouldn't
you
be
violating
the
treaty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
meant
to
say.
i
am
sorry.
yes,
i
meant
to
say
you
would
be
violating
the
blocking
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
would
be
subject
to
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
some
people
like
me
a
fine
is
just
as
bad
as
jail.

justice
thurgood

that
would
be
one
way
to
find
out.
did
your
client
explore
in
this
case
whether
the
requested
information,
for
example,
about
advertisements
in
the
united
states
could
have
been
obtained
from
sources
outside
france?
