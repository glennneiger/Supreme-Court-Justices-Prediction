mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
mr.
chief
justice,
and
say
it
please
the
court,
we
respectfully
request
this
court
to
affirm
the
lower
court's
decision
and
allow
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
john
and
rosa
george
and
dennis
jones,
to
proceed
with
their
request
of
discovery
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
as
opposed
to
the
procedures
under
the
hague
evidence
convention.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
we
certainly
agree
with
the
result,
your
honor.
where
we
differ
with
the
parties
and
the
amicus
parties
to
this
case
is
that
the
hague
evidence
convention
does
not
apply
at
all
to
the
discovery
requested
in
this
case,
that
being
interrogatories,
requests
for
admissions,
and
requests
for
production,
for
the
reason
that
the
discovery
requested
in
this
case
does
not
fall
within
the
very
terms
of
the
convention
itself,
that
is,
the
taking
of
evidence
abroad.
in
this
case
the
plaintiffs
are
not
abroad
taking
evidence.
the
evidence
is
produced
in
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that
is
true,
your
honor.
necessarily
there
will
be
preparatory
acts
performed
in
the
country
of
france
in
order
to
comply
with
these
discovery
requests.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
we
disagree
with
their
reading
of
the
convention.
that
is
a
fundamental
difference.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
magistrate
in
the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit
made
the
necessary
analysis
so
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
case
to
be
remanded
in
order
to
perform
that
analysis
again.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that
is
true.
and
our
basic
position
is
that
the
hague
evidence
convention
by
its
very
terms
does
not
apply
to
this
particular
discovery.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
no,
the
hague
evidence
convention
applies
to
document
production,
your
honor.
as
we
view
the
convention
if
the
discovery
takes
place
in
the
united
states,
in
other
words,
if
there
are
no
adversaries,
united
states
adversaries
intruding
upon
french
soil,
that
the
hague
convention
does
not
apply.
those
provisions
with
regard
to
the
production
of
documents
would
apply
in
the
taking
of
a
deposition
upon
french
soil.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
but
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
could
have--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--i
think
an
american
litigant
always
has
that
option--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--of
using
the
hague
evidence
convention
for
the
type
discovery
that
we
requested
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
well,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
hague
evidence
convention
is
not
exclusive,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
yes,
your
honor.
the
exclusivity
issue
has
not
been
resolved
by
the
signatories
to
the
convention,
and
in
the
1985
special
commission
that
they
had
the
parties
were
in
disagreement
as
to
whether
or
not
the
convention
was
exclusive.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
the
trial
court
indeed
has
no
obligation
to
consider
whether
or
not
hague
evidence
convention
procedures
should
be
applied.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
there
are
two
reasons
why
it
should
not
apply
in
this
case.
number
one,
it
is
our
position
that
we
are
not
intruding
upon
french
judicial
sovereignty
or
french
soil
in
the
production
of
documents,
answers
to
interrogatories,
requests
for
admissions
that
are
made,
produced
in
the
united
states,
and
secondly--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
no.
not
in
this
case,
for
the
reason
that,
one,
the
terms
of
the
convention
itself
is
not
exclusive.
in
a
reading
of
the
history,
particularly
the
history
of
the
american
adoption
of
the
convention,
clearly
shows
that
there
was
no
intent
by
the
united
states
to
make
the
convention
exclusive.
thirdly,
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
france
has
adopted
article
23
where
they
state
unequivocally
that
they
will
refuse
to
honor
any
letters
of
request
for
production
of
documents
for
pretrial
discovery,
as
known
in
common
law
countries.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
your
honor,
i
have
some
difficulties
with
that
letter.
number
one,
that
letter
was
generated
six
days
before
the
french
amicus
brief
was
filed
with
this
court.
that
position
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
courts
at
any
other
time
until
six
days
before
they
filed
their
brief.
secondly,
that
is
an
intergovernmental
communication.
it
is
not
the
law
of
france.
it
has
not
been
adopted
by
the
french
legislature.
article
23
indeed
has.
another
problem
with
that
letter,
your
honor,
is,
if
france
receives
a
favorable
ruling
from
this
court,
what
is
to
prevent
the
ministry
of
justice
in
france
from
changing
their
position
away
from
that
letter?
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
if
there
is
no
intrusion
by
the
adversary
on
french
soil,
that
the
hague
evidence
convention
does
not
apply.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
and
we
conceded
and
agreed
with
the
lower
court--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--we
conceded
that
if
activity
by
the
adversary,
the
american
adversary
takes
place
on
french
soil,
that
the
hague
evidence
convention
procedures
should
apply.
the
example
of
the
american
lawyer
going
to
france
to
obtain
the
requested
documents
we
agree
that
conduct
should
be
governed
by
the
hague
evidence
convention
as
the
hague
evidence
convention
is
the
supreme
law
of
this
land,
as
are
the
federal
rules,
of
course.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
the
safety
valve
in
that
case
is
that
the
french
litigant
would
inform
the
district
court
that
if
we
comply
with
this
discovery
order
we
are
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
at
that
point,
i
think
the
district
court
has
to
make
an
analysis
as
to
whether
or
not
that
is
a
valid
argument,
in
other
words,
that
in
fact
is
going
to
have.
the
french
have
adopted
their
blocking
statute,
which
makes
it
a
criminal
penalty
to
release
certain
information.
the
question
is,
and
the
question
the
district
court
should
look
at
is,
can
that
blocking
statute
be
waived,
and
we
don't
have
any
sufficient
record
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
your
honor,
no.
in
this
case
we
submit
that
the
hague
evidence
convention
is
not
applicable
to
the
discovery
requested.
the
court
need
go
no
further.
if
the
court
needs
not
go
any
further,
of
course,
it
doesn't
have
to
make
that
analysis.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
absolutely,
your
honor.
it
is
not
required
to
be
used
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
your
honor,
the
court
certainly
has
to
take
into
consideration
that
statute.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that's
really
a
two-pronged
test.
one,
does
the
hague
evidence
convention
apply,
and
secondly,
if
it
does
not
can
we
obtain
the
information
without
subjecting
someone
to
the
violation
of
french
criminal
law.
the
societe
internationale
versus
rogers
case,
of
course,
dealt
with
that
type
of
situation
long
before
the
hague
evidence
convention
came
into
being.
in
that
case,
of
course,
the
court
required
the
district
court
to
make
a
comity
analysis
to
see
whether
or
not
in
imposing
sanctions
for
failure
to
make
discovery,
whether
or
not
the
foreign
national
had
made
a
good
faith
effort
to
get
around
that
blocking
statute,
in
other
words,
to
waive
that
blocking
statute.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that's
right.
our
position
is
that
rather
than
make
the
comity
analysis
up
front
is
that
you
make
the
comity
analysis
when
the
discovery
procedure
falls
apart,
and
you
cannot
receive
the
discovery
because
of
the
blocking
statute.
in
other
words,
we
need
no
comity
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
hague
evidence
convention
would
be
applicable
in
a
particular
case
initially.
but
when
the
court
gets
down
the
road
to
determine
whether
or
not
sanctions
should
be
imposed
against
a
foreign
national,
then,
of
course,
the
comity
analysis
should
be
made
to
determine
whether
or
not
those
sanctions
are
appropriate.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
i
understand
that
that's
what
our
opponent's
position
is,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
our
position
is
that
the
hague
evidence
convention
is
not
mandatory,
and
that,
yes,
a
foreign
national
or
a
foreign
country
could
provide
less
restrictive
procedures.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
they
certainly
could
do
that,
your
honor.
obviously,
it
is
not
our
opponent's
position
that
they
could
do
that.
it
is
our
position
that
they
in
fact
could
do
that
and
should
have
done
it.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
no,
because
the
hague
convention
is
not
exclusive.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
and
is
not
mandatory.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that
is
what
our
opponents
say,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
we
have
no
personal
experience,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
you
would
be
violating
the
blocking
statute,
your
honor,
and
not
the
treaty.
the
blocking
statute
requires--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that
is
correct.
possibility
of
a
fine.
the
record
is
not
sufficient
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--me,
too,
your
honor.
the
record
is
not
sufficient
in
this
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
france
in
fact
enforces
that
blocking
statute.
of
course,
the
impetus
behind
that
blocking
statute
was--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
our
client
has
not,
your
honor.
we
have
presumed
that
some
of
that
evidence
in
fact
was
generated
in
the
united
states
and
in
fact
was
in
the
united
states.
mr.
ford
has
indicated
this
morning
that
the
information
we
were
given
in
response
to
our
discovery
requests
and
documents
indeed
came
from
united
states
sources.
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
there
is
any
additional
information
that
could
be
obtained
from
united
states
sources
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
no,
we
haven't.
we
have
not,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
believe
the
order
in
the
district
court
case
said
that
we
could
take
depositions
in
the
united
states,
but
that
if
we
were
to
take
depositions
in
france,
that
the
provisions
of
the
hague
evidence
convention
would
apply.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
it
was
magistrate
ronald
longstaff,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
magistrate
under
section
636,
your
honor,
for
submission.
the
hague
evidence
convention
is
not
exclusive
in
any
way.
one,
the
terms
of
the
convention?
don't
indicate
any--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--well,
we
read
the
order
as
saying,
if
we
are
to
take
depositions
in
france,
the
hague
evidence
convention
applies.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
i
is
our
position
that
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
certainly
allow
us
to--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--to
require
parties--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--no,
we
have
not,
your
honor.
the
total
extent
of
discovery
in
this
case
is
before
this
court.
and
we
have
proceeded
no
further.
and
of
course
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
that
we
are
subjected
to
a
stay
which
was
entered
originally
by
the
district
court
and
then
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
we
are
still
under
a
stay
to
this
day,
so
even
if
be
wanted
to
take
additional
depositions
we
could
not,
your
honor.
the
hague
convention
cannot
be
exclusive.
the
results,
if
this
court
finds
it
to
be
exclusive,
particularly
in
view
of
france's
adoption
of
article
23
and
the
blocking
statute,
will
have
significant
effects
with
regard
to
litigation
and
also
the
economy
of
this
country.
if
the
hague
evidence
convention
is
exclusive,
as
argued
by
some
parties
in
this
case,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
necessarily
would
not
apply,
and
that
would
include
the
sanction
provisions.
this,
we
submit,
would
cause
the
creation
of
information
havens,
the
example
of
general
motors
using
a
subsidiary
to
house
its
documents
in
a
foreign
country,
a
signatory
to
the
hague
evidence
convention,
with
the
adoption
of
an
article
23
and
a
blocking
statute.
an
american
litigant
would
not
be
able
to
obtain
those
documents,
and
secondly,
it
may
well
create
offshore
immunity.
in
other
words,
an
america
manufacturer
may
decide
to
manufacture
his
products
in
a
foreign
country
so
he
is
not
subjected
in
a
real
sense
to
liability
in
this
country
because
they
can
effectively
thwart
any
meaningful
discovery.
to
thwart
any
meaningful
discovery
flies
in
the
face
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
this
country's
judicial
system.
discovery
is
critical
in
these
cases,
and
without
it
american
litigants
would
have
their
hands
tied
and
be
unable
to
proceed
meaningfully
with
their
litigation
against
foreign
nationals.
the
court
may
want
to
look
at
the
fairness
issue
in
this
case.
it
is
totally
unfair
to
allow
a
french
nationalized
company
to
be
subject
to
the
in
personam
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
court
to
be
able
to
shield
itself
from
pretrial
discovery
by
use
of
the
hague
convention
and
the
blocking
statute,
and
on
the
other
hand
and
at
the
same
time
have
the
availability
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
are
liberal
in
regard
to
their
discovery
positions,
to
be
used
offensively
against
a
domestic
litigant,
and
the
domestic
litigant
not
having
an
opportunity
to
use
those
same
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
a
totally
unfair
situation,
and
i
think
that
when
the
united
states
adopted
the
hague
convention
there
was
no
intent
that
such
a
result
be
reached.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
that
is
true.
if
there
is--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--your
honor,
this
court,
the
united
states
court
cannot
compel
an
individual
to
transport
himself
from
france
to
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
yes.
the
united
states
court
certainly
has
that
power.
the
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
force
that
individual
to
physically
come
to
the
united
states.
if--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--and
that
is
the
remedy,
your
honor.
that
is
the
remedy,
are
these
sanctions
available
under
the
federal
rules
if
they
fail
to--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
force--
mr.
richard
h.
doyle,
iv
--no,
there
is
not,
your
honor.
there
is
not.
thank
you.
