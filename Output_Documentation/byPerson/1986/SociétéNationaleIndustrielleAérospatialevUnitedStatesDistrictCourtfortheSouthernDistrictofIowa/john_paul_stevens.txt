justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ford,
may
i
just
interrupt?
you
say
your
position
now
is
that
they
should
resort
to
the
hague
convention
in
the
first
instance.
is
that
the
same
position
you
took
in
the
trial
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
you
abandoning
the
exclusive
use
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you?
must
be
used?
suppose
a
plaintiff
serves
you
with
an
interrogatory,
did
you
place
this
ad
in
this
flying
magazine,
and
you
could
answer
it
yes
or
no.
you
say
you
can't
answer
that
question
without
requiring
resort
to
the
hague
convention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
not
must
in
every
sense.
it
is
something
you
could
waive
as
a
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
didn't
violate
any
international
treaties
by
doing
that,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
by
doing
so
you
acted
consistently
with
the
convention,
as
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
when
must
the
convention
first
be
resorted
to,
just
whenever
the
defendant,
whenever
the
party
opposing
discovery
requests
that
they
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
officer
of
the
corporate
defendant
who
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
american
court
could
write
a
letter
that
says
please
send
me
a
copy
of
this
document,
it
still
means
they
have
to
go
through
the
hague
convention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
officer
is
willing
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute,
which,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
you
would
not
have
needed
if
the
convention
means
what
you
say
it
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
if
the
convention
is
exclusive
you
wouldn't
have
needed
that
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
this
be
true
also
of
an
american
corporation
with
a
french
wholly
owned
subsidiary?
the
american
corporation
could
also
say
that
the
evidence
that
you
request
is
in
france
and
we
insist
that
you
follow
the
procedures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
even
if
it
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary,
say,
of
general
motors
or
some
company
like
that?
they
could
make
the
same
objection,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
weren't
those
third
party
depositions,
for
the
cost
part?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
supposed
to
do
that
in
each
case?
is
that
your
point?
each
case
they
should
find
out
the
foreign
interest
considerations
that
should
affect
the
district
court's
comity
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
they
do
that
in
this
case?
didn't
they
just
take
a
position
that
there
can
be
no
discovery
except
pursuant
to
the
hague
convention?
they
didn't
put
out
any
facts
that
say
there
is
anything
special
about
this
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
don't
they
have
to
say
in
their
motion
to
limit
discovery,
we
have
got
a
trade
secret
problem
in
this
case
that
you
have
got
to
be
sensitive
about,
and
they
didn't
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
didn't
ask
for
anything
except
a
100
percent
protective
order
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
the
district
judge
said
you
must
take
the
depositions
in
france.
he
did
that
independently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they
made
the
kind
of
showing
that
requires
reversal
in
this
case?
is
the
showing
they
made
in
this
case
enough
to
justify
reversal
under
the
government's
position?
that
is
really
what
i
am
driving
at.
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
has
the
burden
of
supplementing
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
somebody
has
got
to
go
forward
before
the
judge
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
has
done
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
really
puzzled,
because
article
3(g)
of
the
convention
says
in
words
"the
letter
request
shall
specify
the
documents
or
other
property,
real
or
personal,
to
be
inspected.
"
now,
do
you
mean
it
doesn't
apply
because
they
are
documents
possessed
by
a
party?
or
it
just
has
no
application
to
document
production?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
may
not
apply
in
the
sense
that
it
mandates
that
the
procedure
be
adopted,
but
is
it
not
at
least
an
optional
procedure
that
you
could
have
requested
a
letter
of
request
and
you
could
have
asked
the
court
to
follow
the
hague
convention
if
you
thought
it
would
be
advantageous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
using
the
words
"doesn't
apply"
is
really
kind
of
a
confusing
term.
when
you
use
it
you
mean
it
does
not
mandate
following
the
procedures,
but
conceivably
it
would
apply
in
the
sense
that
it
is
an
optional
alternative
available
to
you.
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
it
doesn't
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
when
you
say
and
maybe
when
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
doesn't
apply,
all
they
meant
was,
it
is
not
exclusive.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
government
of
france
disagrees
with
you
on
that,
so
there
is
a
question.
well,
there
are
common
law
countries
who
certainly
think
it
is
exclusive.
isn't
that
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
doyle--
0
xxx.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
doyle,
the
district
court
order,
if
i
remember
correctly,
permitted
you
to
take
depositions
only
in
france,
but
it
did
permit
you
to
go
ahead
and
take
them.
have
you
taken
any
depositions
yet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
doyle,
the
order
says
if
discovery
depositions
are
to
be
undertaken
the
court
will
require
compliance
with
the
hague
convention.
it
doesn't
say
undertaken
in
france.
that
is
why
i
thought
they
had
to
all
be
in
france.
you
say
i
misread
the
order.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
not
what
it
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
i
see
what
you
are
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
haven't
taken
any
depositions
in
the
united
states
either,
then,
have
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
acknowledge
that
you
couldn't
compel
an
officer
of
your
opposing
party
to
appear
in
the
united
states
and
give
his
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
individual.
you
have
got
a
corporate
defendant.
you
say
you
don't
think
you
could
serve
notice
to
have
them
produce
the
president
of
the
corporation
if
he
has
knowledge
of
the
whole
matter
in
the
united
states
for
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
can
tell
the
corporation
we
will
dismiss
your...
strike
your
answer
if
you
don't
show
up,
or
something
like
that.
there
are
all
sorts
of
sanctions--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
contend
there
is
any
difference
at
all
between
the
power...
just
forgetting
the
convention
between
the
power
of
the
federal
district
judge
to
order
an
officer
of
an
american
corporation...
say
his
office
is
in
new
york...
to
testify
in
iowa
or
california
and
an
officer
of
a
french
corporation
who
does
business
in
iowa
to
testify
in
iowa?
what
is
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
they've
got
jurisdiction
over
the
corporation.
they
transact
business
in
iowa,
and
they
have
an
officer
who
is
either
in
new
york
or
paris.
is
there
a
difference
in
the
power
of
the
district
judge
to
compel
the
officer
to
appear
and
testify?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ford,
as
i
understand
the
questions
presented
and
the
position
you
espouse
here,
it
doesn't
depend
at
all
on
a
blocking
statute.
you
would
make
exactly
the
same
argument
if
they
repealed
the
blocking
statute,
that
you
must
resort
in
the
first
instance
to
the
hague
convention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
questions
presented
don't
mention
the
blocking
statute,
in
your
cert
petition.
so
i
don't
see
how
that
affects
the
analysis
of
the
issue
you
have
asked
us
to
decide,
the
blocking
statute,
because
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
there
were
no
blocking
statute.
