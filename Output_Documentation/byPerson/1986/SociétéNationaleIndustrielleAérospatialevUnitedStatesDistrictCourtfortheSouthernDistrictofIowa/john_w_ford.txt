mr.
john
w.
ford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
the
hague
evidence
convention
which
establishes
procedures
for
gathering
evidence
located
on
the
soil
of
other
signator
nations.
the
united
states
and
the
other
convention
signators
before
the
court
all
agree
the
court
below
erred
in
holding
the
convention
does
not
apply
here.
they
all
agree
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded.
the
major
issue
before
the
court
today
is
how
to
harmonize
the
convention
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
because
both
are
the
law
of
the
united
states.
as
the
amicus
briefs
show,
the
extent
to
which
the
convention
displaces
u.s.
discovery
rules
is
a
question
on
which
the
convention
signators
hold
divergent
views.
to
reconcile
those
differences
and
to
effectuate
the
convention's
purpose,
today
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
a
general
rule
requiring
resort
by
american
courts
to
the
hague
evidence
convention
in
the
first
instance.
the
convention
preamble
states
its
basic
purpose
of
mutual
judicial
cooperation
in
civil
or
commercial
matters.
its
history
shows
the
convention
was
adopted
in
large
measure
to
avoid
the
friction
created
by
the
extraterritorial
application
of
american
discovery
procedures
as
the
new
restatement
of
the
law
of
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
recognizes
american
attempts
to
conduct
discovery
abroad
have
been
a
major
source
of
friction
with
our
european
trading
partners.
in
negotiation
of
the
treaty
the
united
states
obtained
significant
concessions
from
the
civil
law
nations
on
the
basis
that
convention
procedures
would
be
a
substitute
for
the
unsupervised
extraterritorial
use
of
american
discovery
rules,
or
as
some
writers
have
referred
to
it,
legal
tourism
by
american
lawyers
on
the
discovery
trail.
at
the
bargaining
table
the
civil
law
nations
made
clear
they
regarded
such
american
discovery
practices
as
invasive
of
their
sovereign
rights.
ultimately,
the
civil
law
nations
agreed
to
liberalize
and
simplify
the
process
for
obtaining
evidence
through
their
courts
for
use
abroad
as
the
quid
pro
quo
for
lessening
foreign
intrusions
of
their
sovereignty.
mr.
john
w.
ford
justice
stevens,
it
is
to
this
extent.
in
the
trial
court
we
urged
first
upon
the
court
exclusive
use.
mr.
john
w.
ford
alternatively
we
argued--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--we
are
not
abandoning,
justice
stevens,
the
exclusive
use
position.
as
a
french
national,
my
client
supports
the
position
of
its
home
sovereign
as
stated
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
for
the
republic
of
france.
however,
as
an
independent
entity,
an
independently
managed
entity,
although
albeit
we
are
owned,
our
shares
are
owned
by
the
government
of
france,
we
must
face
the
practical
results
of
litigating
before
united
states
courts,
and
recognizing
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general,
particularly
after
the
opinion
given
to
the
court
in
falzon,
volkswagen
versus
falzon,
cited
in
the
briefs,
we
today
urge
the
court
for
a
general
rule
for
american
courts
of
first
use.
mr.
john
w.
ford
it
is
our
position,
justice
marshall,
that
we
are.
mr.
john
w.
ford
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
w.
ford
it
can,
and
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
john
w.
ford
i
believe
what
is
before
the
court
is
the
opportunity
to
establish
a
general
rule
for
american
courts.
mr.
john
w.
ford
to
have
resort
to
the
convention
in
the
first
use,
on
a
first
use
basis.
mr.
john
w.
ford
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--i
agree,
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
w.
ford
i
believe
in
the
american
courts
the
opinions
below
have
a
great
deal
of
confusion.
a
number
of
cases,
without
saying
so,
look
upon
the
convention
in
a
particular
case
as
somehow
a
conflict
of
law
problem
with
foreign
law,
and
as
the
justice
observed,
it
is
not
foreign
law,
it
is
the
law
of
the
united
states.
very
few
cases
have,
and
we
have
cited
them
in
the
brief,
addressed
the
problem
of
reconciling
the
hague
evidence
convention
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
john
w.
ford
the
present
position
of
the
solicitor
general
as
i
understand
it,
justice
o'connor,
is,
this
case
should
be
remanded
for
a
case
by
case
comity
analysis.
mr.
john
w.
ford
in
our
view
a
comity
analysis
certainly
in
this
case
and
any
similar
case
necessarily
leads
to
that
conclusion,
but
the
rule
proposed
a
change
from
the
solicitor
general's
earlier
position
in
volkswagen
versus
falzon,
where
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
amicus
took
the
position
the
convention
was
exclusive--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--just
a
few
years
ago,
now
turns
us
to
the
suggestion
the
case
be
sent
back
for
american
courts
in
each
case
to
have
a
factually
laden,
a
factually
burdened
comity
inquiry.
mr.
john
w.
ford
that
is--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
john
w.
ford
i
do
not
believe
so,
justice
o'connor,
because
it
is
not
a
fact
question.
to
the
extent
we
have
a
factual
inquiry,
of
course,
of
comity
analysis
it
would
rest
with
the
party
proposing
it,
but
it
is
not
a
fact
question.
i
do
not
view
it
and
submit
it
is
not
a
conflict
of
law
question.
it
is
part
of
the
law
of
the
forum,
and
for
the
application
of
the
proper
law
of
the
forum
no
one
has
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
john
w.
ford
i
do
not,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
it
is
a
logical
assumption
to
be
made
but
it
does
need
further
analysis.
i
speak
as
one
in
that
position,
and
i
have
no
better
information
than
respondent.
if
i
do,
of
course,
i
pass
it
immediately
to
him.
we
share
the
same
information.
there
is,
i
submit,
no
proper
warrant
for
placing
a
burden
of
proof
concept
upon
a
party
urging
the
applicability
of
the
hague
evidence
convention
outside
of
the
comity
analysis.
it
is
the
law
of
the
forum.
mr.
john
w.
ford
well,
justice
scalia
if
i
may
point
out,
we
are
urging
that
this
be
a
rule
for
all
american
courts.
as
we
see
from
the
cases
below
state
courts
must
deal
with
the
problem
as
well.
mr.
john
w.
ford
it
comes
from
a
consideration
of
comity,
which
we
have
discussed
in
the
brief.
mr.
john
w.
ford
yes,
that
is
true,
justice
scalia.
also--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--well,
i
would
like
to
say--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--i
should
have
made
it
clear
in
the
first
instance,
a
reading
of
the
convention
itself
and
the
convention
history
supports
prior
to
any
resort
to
comity
principles
the
proposition
that
the
hague
evidence
convention
by
an
american
court
must
be...
must
be
used
in
the
first
instance.
resort
must
be
had
in
the
first
instance.
it
is
clear
that
any
fair
reading
of
the
negotiations,
the
bargaining
table--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--we
do
not,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
w.
ford
we
have
responded
to
all
discovery
against
us.
mr.
john
w.
ford
based
on
any
and
all
information
we
could
get
in
the
united
states.
it
is
not
part
of
the
joint
appendix.
we
did
admit--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--to
the
genuineness
of
those
advertising
articles
after,
through
u.s.
sources.
mr.
john
w.
ford
that
is
our
position.
mr.
john
w.
ford
when
we
are
unable
within
the
united
states
to
reach
the
evidence
gathering
process
to
respond,
we
or
any
other
party,
or,
to
put
it
another
way,
when
the
evidence
must
be
gathered
by
whatever
means
on
foreign
soil
of
a
signator,
it
is
not
the
nationality,
if
the
court
will
permit,
that
controls,
and
there
is
where
we
find
much
confusion
below.
it
is
the
geographic
location
of
the
evidence,
whatever
the
evidence
may
be.
mr.
john
w.
ford
that
is
our
position,
because
otherwise
the
divergent--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--that
is
correct,
because
in
the
case
of
france
we
have
the
defensive
legislation
referred
to
in
the
cases
as
the
blocking
statute,
a
term
we
have
adopted
to
avoid
confusion,
and
in
the
case
put
to
me
by
justice--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--we
would
not
have
needed--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--well,
it
isn't
so
much
a
question
of
our
need
as
france's
declaration
of
its
own
policy.
the
statute
is
a
criminal
statute.
it
is
a
declaration
of
the
policy
of
france
with
respect
to
essentially
growing
out
of
its
judicial
control
as
a
civil
law
nation
of
evidence
gathering
within
its
borders,
as
we
know,
of
course,
vastly
different
from
common
law
countries
and
the
american
courts.
in
the
case
of
the
corporate
officer
that
the
court
posed
to
me
again
it
is
the
location
of
the
evidence.
of
course
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
him,
has
the
power,
but
the
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
it
is
a
proper
exercise
of
that
power
in
ordering
a
foreign
national
over
whom
an
american
court
has
jurisdiction
to
gather
evidence
on
the
foreign
soil
of
a
signatory
when
it
is
the
clear
and
unambiguous
policy
of
that
foreign
country
signatory
that
it
and
it
alone
controls
evidence
gathering
on
its
soil
and
within
its
borders.
mr.
john
w.
ford
if
we
have
the
situation
where
the
evidence
reposes
on
french
soil
and
french
soil
alone
and
we
are
dealing
with
the
the
hague
convention,
again,
it
is
the
location
of
the
evidence
controls.
mr.
john
w.
ford
that
is
correct.
they
are
in
the
same
position.
the
first
use
rule,
as
i
have
recited,
we
believe,
does
reconcile
the
divergent
viewpoints.
france
regards
the
convention
as
exclusive.
mr.
john
w.
ford
it
is.
mr.
john
w.
ford
always.
mr.
john
w.
ford
absent
an
absolute
extreme
situation
where
there
has
been
a
demonstrated
record
that
this
would
be
completely
futile.
we
find
none
of
that
in
the
courts
below.
we
find
american
courts
speculating
what
a
contracting
national
sovereign,
a
contracting
state
might
or
might
not
do.
there
is
the
first
folly.
that
is
for
the
contracting
state.
and
this...
and
it
is
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
ford
or
has
returned--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--letter
after
letter
of
request
unexecuted.
we
now
have
a
developed
record
in
that
situation,
justice
scalia,
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
contending
is
the
wisdom
of
the
general
rule.
the
american
courts
have
no
reported
experience
with
france
or
any
of
the
other
signatory
nations,
certainly
with
france--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--of
dissatisfaction.
mr.
john
w.
ford
that
is
for
the
court
upon
a
record
to
create
an
exception
to
the
general
rule,
so
my
answer
would
be--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--of
course.
of
course.
i
am
sorry
i...
i
was--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--and
i
didn't
quite
make
it
clear.
the
position
is,
for
a
general
rule
with
the
court
to
carve
out
such
exceptions
as
experience
warrants,
it
is
that
experience
that
is
currently
lacking.
mr.
john
w.
ford
obviously
where
there
are
some
exceptions
or
reservations
taken
that
show
incompatibility
and
collide
with
overriding
national
interests
of
the
united
states
is
one
that
occurs
to
me,
but
i
say
that
only
experience
could
determine
this
with
a
general
rule
in
place
from
this
court.
mr.
john
w.
ford
they
have,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
w.
ford
i
suggest
what
the
american
courts
have
done
is
to
have
moved--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--it
would
have
to
make
a
first
use
of
the
convention
to
test
the
meaning
of
the
article
23
reservation
by
the
country.
mr.
john
w.
ford
well,
under
the
question
as
put,
with
the
court
knows,
we
know,
if
that
knowledge
is
true
knowledge
and
factually
correct,
the
court
is
obviously
faced
with
the
option
of
carving
out
an
exception.
if
i
may
say,
it
is
the
presumption
below
of
many
courts
that
they
knew
when
in
fact
we
know
from
looking
at
the
convention
history
they
didn't
know.
there
is
a
major
misunderstanding
of
the
article
23
reservation
of
the
civil
law
countries.
mr.
john
w.
ford
the
position
of
france
today
is
as
expressed
in
the
letter
from
the
minister
of
justice
to
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
in
appendix
a
to
the
amicus
brief
for
the
republic
of
france.
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
has
addressed
the
hague
conference
as
recommended
in
that
letter,
and
we
see
in
that
letter
an
intent
clearly
expressed
to
honor
direct
nexus
focused
document
requests,
and
it
is--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--i
am
aware
of
none.
i
understand
the
letter
is...
justice
o'connor's
question
was
today,
and
i
understand
the
letter
has
just
gone
out
or
is
just
going
out
in
furtherance
of
the
interdepartmental
memorandum,
but
the
convention,
the
report
of
convention
proceedings
in
1985
shows
the
civil
law
countries
do
not
have
the
same
understanding
that
american
courts
think
they
do
with
respect
to
unfocused
document
requests
on
the
one
hand
as
opposed
to
pretrial
discovery
as
known
in
the
common
law
countries
on
the
other.
there
simply
has
not
been
sufficient
experience.
mr.
john
w.
ford
it
must
then
make,
with
the
benefit
of
a
developed
record,
a
comity
analysis.
mr.
john
w.
ford
first
of
all--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--we
suggest--
mr.
john
w.
ford
--first
of
all,
we
suggest,
justice
white,
that
orders
should
not
become
routine
merely
directing,
it
has
to
be
a
considered
comity
analysis.
mr.
john
w.
ford
yes.
well,
following,
for
example,
the
interhandle
case,
or
societe
internationale
versus
rogers,
cited
in
the
brief,
we
suggest
that
following
the
analysis
the
court
would
fashion
an
appropriate
discovery
order,
a
workaday
item
for
any
american
trial
court,
and
in
fashioning
that
appropriate
order
it
would
not
make
dismissals
or
such
similar
types
of
sanctions
become
routine
at
all,
if
ever.
indeed,
in
fashioning
an
appropriate
order
it
would
consider
such
options
as
evidentiary
preclusion,
the
issue
elimination,
perhaps,
other
type
of
similar
control
over
the
evidentiary
stream
as
the
result
of
a
limitation
on
the
flow
of
pretrial
information.
and
of
course
therefore
it
is
then
for
the
party
whose
evidence
is
on
foreign
soil
to
consider
in
a
genuinely
voluntary
basis
the
use
of
the
chapter
2
proceedings,
and
there
is
the
other
option
that
has
been
removed
from
any
nationals,
be
they
foreign
nationals
as
my
client
or
anyone
else,
where
the
evidence
can
be
found
only
abroad.
without
that
appropriate
discovery
order
fashioned,
justice
white,
they
cannot
adequately
consider
what
could
be
done
under
voluntary
methods
and
considered
in
the
proper
light.
we
ask
here,
of
course,
that
respondent
avail
itself
of
the
convention
as
we
have
from
the
beginning.
they
have
not
chosen
to
do
so,
which
has
brought
us
here.
the
first
use
rule,
we
submit,
as
a
general
rule,
with
exceptions
carved
out
as
necessary,
has
every
chance
of
working
in
practice
and
is
exactly
what
is
needed
to
develop
an
experience
in
this
area
within
the
american
courts
subject,
of
course,
to
review
at
appropriate
stages
by
this
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
may
any
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
w.
ford
with
respect
to
respondent's
remarks
regarding
questions
of
the
applicability
of
the
french
defensive
legislation
or
blocking
statute
and
the
solicitor
general's
representative's
remarks,
which
i
understood
to
be
there
was
some
question
in
that
office
whether
or
not
the
french
law
applies
to
french
attorneys
highlights
one
of
the
major
points
be
are
trying
to
make.
that
is
not
a
question
to
be
second-guessed
on
this
shore.
that
is
what
has
led
all
of
the
american
courts
into
the
chagmire
again
without
a
general
rule.
that
is
france's
prerogative
as
it
is
of
any
foreign
sovereign
nation
to
state
its
own
philosophy.
whether
or
not
it
reflects
fines,
imprisonment,
or
whatever,
in
declaring
that
philosophy
it
is
for
that
sovereign,
and
as
we
know
from
the
schooner
exchange
versus
mcfadden,
cited
in
the
briefs,
it
is
not
for
the
courts
of
this
nation
to
perform
any
function
with
respect
to
that
declaration
of
a
foreign
sovereign
other
than
understanding
what
it
is
the
foreign
sovereign--

--oh,
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
w.
ford
the
same
argument
would
be
made
for
a
general
rule
if
there
were
no
blocking
statute.
mr.
john
w.
ford
the
issue
of
the
blocking
statute
comes
into
play
only
when
we
reach
the
comity
analysis,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
w.
ford
if
indeed
it
is
reached,
and
article
23
also
has
its
