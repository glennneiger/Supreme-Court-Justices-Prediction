let
me
put
it
another
way.
isn't
the
effect
of
your
position
to
place
the
taxpayer
on
a
cash
receipts
and
disbursements
basis?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
put
your
finger
on
it
when
you
said
a
reserve
is
self-correcting.
certainly
a
bad
debt
reserve
is
like
this.
you
can
overreserve
some
time
and
it
will
correct
itself
in
the
long
run.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
then
that
you
accept
the
application
of
the
all
events
test.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
doesn't
always
assure
our
position
on
it,
though.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
of
yours.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--wasn't
there
a
time
when
insurance
companies
were
hardly
taxed
at
all?
