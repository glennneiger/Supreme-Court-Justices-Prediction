we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-1385,
united
states
versus
general
dynamics
corporation.
you
may
start
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

aren't
the
two
questions
kind
of
intertwined
with
one
another?
when
you
say
that
all
the
events
haven't
occurred,
the
final
event
would
be
the
determination
of
the
amount,
perhaps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horowitz.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
mcnown.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
those
two
necessarily
totally
separate,
ms.
mcnown?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
you
are
the
milwaukee
transit
company
and
you
knew
that
as
of
december
20th,
1986,
you
had...
your
bus
had
been
in
an
accident,
and
that
you
were
liable
but
you
didn't
yet
know
the
amount.
now,
would
it
be
possible
to
say
that
all
events
had
accrued
so
that
you
could
accrue
that
even
though
you
had
paid
nothing
during
1986?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
am
just
using
that
as
a
hypothetical.
let's
call
it
the
minneapolis
transit
company.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
my--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
my
hypothesis
you
would
fail
part
2.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
your
answer
be
the
same
even
though
the
minneapolis
transit
company
almost
invariably
pays
out
something
on
all
claims,
but
it
may
be
a
lot
different
than
what
the
plaintiff
is
demanding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
to
some
of
them
you
don't
know
even
by
the
end
of
the
year.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
was
certain
that
there
would
be
a
winner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
know
who
they
are.
of
course,
you
didn't
in
the
jackpot
either.
the
equivalent
of
the
slot
machine
case
here
is
to
have
knowledge
that
somebody
has
been
to
the
doctor
and
has
got
an
appendectomy
which
costs
so
much
money,
but
not
to
know
the
name
of
the
individual.
that
is
the
equivalent
of
the
slot
machine
case.
you
don't
know
who
the
payment
is
going
to
go
to,
but
you
know
that
a
payment
is
due.
here
you
don't
know
the
individual.
you
don't
even
know
for
sure
that
there
has
been
an
appendectomy
with
respect
to
all
of
those
for
whom
no
claim
has
yet
been
filed.

i
don't
think
at
least
in
this
case
those
issues
are
quite
as
sharply
severable
as
you
indicate.
i
think
one
inevitably
rubs
off
on
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
could
you
deduct
for
travel
expenses
if
you
didn't
know
that
any
specific
person
had
traveled
but
only
knew
that
somewhere
in
your
vast
empire
there
were
employees
traveling,
and
that
last
year
there
were
15
of
them
that
traveled,
and
this
year
there
would
probably
be
15?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
following
your
advice
general
dynamics
does
deduct
for
15
travel
payments
in
1986
because
they
had
15
in
1985,
and
then
the
commissioner
comes
in
and
says,
look,
we
have
looked
over
this
thing
and
nobody
traveled
for
general
dynamics
in
1986?
now,
under
your
theory
that
wouldn't...
would
that
invalidate
the
deduction
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mcnown.
mr.
horowitz,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining
should
you
choose
to
use
them.
