well,
mr.
horowitz,
that
wasn't
the
finding
of
the
claims
court,
of
course.
they
said
it
was
purely
ministerial.
was
that
clearly
erroneous?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
seems
to...
how
can
you
say
that
their
determination
of
what
has
to
be
done
for
processing
is
not
a
determination
of
fact--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
a
prerequisite
to
then
applying
the
all
events
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
the
finding
of
the
claims
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
depends
a
little
on
whether
you
treat
the
filing
of
the
claim
within
a
certain
period
as
a
sort
of
statute
of
limitations
within
which
it
can
be
filed.
or
look
at
it
in
terms
of
some
kind
of
waiver,
i
guess.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
the
claims
court
said
the
obligation
was
fixed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
gets
back
to
the
fact
that
i
thought
you
didn't
challenge
the
amount.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
there
are
a
good
many
medical
claims
that
result
in
some
kind
of
contest,
aren't
there?
