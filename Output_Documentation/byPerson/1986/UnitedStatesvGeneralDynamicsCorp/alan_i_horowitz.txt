mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
timing
of
a
tax
deduction.
respondent
is
obligated
under
its
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
reimburse
its
employees
for
certain
medical
expenses.
the
question
is
whether
its
deduction
of
those
reimbursement
payments
should
be
taken
in
the
year
in
which
the
reimbursement
claims
were
filed,
evaluated
by
respondents'
claims
processors,
and
paid,
mostly
1973,
as
we
contend,
or
whether,
in
the
alternative,
respondent
can
accelerate
this
deduction
into
the
previous
year
by
computing
and
deducting
a
statistical
estimate
based
on
its
past
experience
that
is
said
to
represent
claims
that
can
be
expected
to
be
filed
in
1972...
excuse
me,
expected
to
be
filed
later
and
ultimately
paid
in
later
years
for
medical
services
obtained
by
employees
in
1972.
that
is
what
the
federal
circuit
held.
the
background
of
this
case
can
be
briefly
stated
as
follows.
prior
to
1972,
respondent
provided
medical
insurance
for
its
employees
by
means
of
contracts
that
it
entered
into
with
outside
insurance
companies.
beginning
on
october
1st,
1972,
respondent
terminated
this
coverage
and
took
upon
itself
the
responsibility
of
reimbursing
its
employees
directly
for
their
medical
expenses,
though
it
retained
the
coverage
and
benefit
scheme
that
had
been
in
effect
under
the
insurance
company
plans.
at
the
same
time,
respondent
transferred
to
its
own
books
the
so-called
ibnr
reserve,
incurred
but
not
reported
reserve,
that
had
been
established
on
the
books
of
the
insurance
companies.
this
account
is
a
standard
one
kept
by
insurance
companies,
an
actuarial
estimate
intended
to
reflect
their
potential
reimbursement
liability
for
medical
expenses
that
have
been
incurred
but
have
not
yet
been
reported
to
or
evaluated
by
the
insurance
company.
at
the
close
of
1972,
the
estimate
in
this
reserve
account
was
$5.5
million.
in
1977,
respondent
filed
an
amended
return
for
1972
in
which
it
sought
to
deduct
this
figure
as
a
business
expense
incurred
during
the
year
1972
on
the
theory
that
its
employees'
visits
to
the
doctor
created
a
fixed
and
definite
obligation
for
respondent
to
make
a
payment,
presumably
in
the
aggregate
amount
of
$5.5
million
that
they
deducted,
even
though
respondent
did
not
in
fact
effect
any
reimbursement
until
an
employee
filed
a
claim
and
the
claim
was
evaluated
and
approved
in
whole
or
in
part
by
respondent's
processors
in
1973
or
in
the
later
year.
respondent's
effort
to
deduct
the
amount
of
its
ibnr
reserve
is
not
permitted
by
the
code.
this
is
a
classic
example
of
a
reserve
that
is
generally
not
permitted
to
be
deducted
by
ordinary
taxpayers.
it
is
not
an
amount
that
represents
a
real
liability.
it
is
an
aggregate
estimate
based
on
statistical
analyses
of
past
experience
of
predicted
future
liabilities.
it
is
an
amount
that
stays
on
the
books
of
the
respondent
in
perpetuity
and
is
adjusted
year
by
year
to
see
how
the
estimate
is
working
out,
but
it
does
not
purport
to
be
a
determination
of
an
amount
of
a
particular
liability
based
on
the
actual
facts
that
give
rise
to
that
liability.
now,
it
is
okay
for
insurance
companies
to
deduct
such
a
reserve.
that
is
specifically
provided
for
by
the
code,
and
aetna
and
prudential,
the
companies
that
used
to
administer
these
plans,
the
companies
that
used
to
insure
respondent,
were
entitled
to
take
this
deduction.
that
is
because
of
the
special
problems
involved
in
reporting
insurance
company
income,
because
they
take
a
lot
of
premiums
into
income
in
year
one,
and
if
they
did
not
use
this
sort
of
reserve
accounting
system
there
would
be
a
serious
mismatching
of
income
as
to
when
the
premiums
are
taken
in
earlier
and
the
benefits
are
paid
out
later,
but
it
is
clear
that
this
particular
deduction
is
not
available,
is
not
available
to
a
regular
taxpayer,
and
respondent
in
fact
does
not
even
rely
on
the
insurance
company
provisions.
as
justice
brandeis
said
in
brown
v.
helvering,
these
insurance
company
provisions
are
special
technical
provisions
enacted
for
insurance
companies
that
do
not
apply
to
other
taxpayers.
in
general,
reserves
are
not
deductible
by
taxpayers
unless
they
are
specifically
authorized
by
the
code.
now,
in
the
aaa
case
this
court
specifically
rejected
the
notion
on
which
respondent
relies
here
of
using
aggregate
statistical
estimates
as
a
substitute
for
actual
facts
about
individual
expenses.
we
quoted
the
pertinent
part
of
that
at
page
42
of
our
brief,
and
i
would
like
to
read
it
here.
"when
a
company
projects
an
expense
on
a
statistical
basis.
"
and
i
am
now
quoting,
"without
regard
to
individual
expense
but
consistently
with
overall
experience,
its
accounting
doubtless
presents
a
rather
accurate
image
of
the
total
financial
structure,
but
it
fails
to
respect
the
criteria
of
annual
tax
accounting
and
may
be
rejected
by
the
commissioner.
"
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
we
don't
challenge
the
accuracy
of
the
amount,
but
we
do
challenge
the
method
by
which
they
have
computed
their
deduction.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
it
wouldn't
be
precisely
the
same,
although
we
think
we
would
win
that
case
also,
but
i
think
that
this
case
would
be--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
it
would
depend
how
they...
what
deduction
they
took
there,
what
amount
they
took
as
a
deduction.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
the
crucial
difference,
because
here
they
don't
know
anything
about
what
the
actual
bills
were.
you
see,
in
your
case--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
don't
think
so.
maybe
i
can
explain
it.
what
i
think
the
case
is
the
same...
what
we
don't
rely
on
or
what
we
don't
quibble
with
here
is
the
fact
that
they
were...
that
their
estimate
was
wildly
inaccurate
and
was
off
by
more
than
$1
million.
the
court
could
treat
this
the
same
as
if
they
had
in
fact
paid
out
$5.5
million,
the
amount
that
they
estimated,
rather
than
only
paying
out
$4.4
million.
that
discrepancy
is
not
the
subject
of
our
petition.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
final
event
here
is
the
evaluation
of
the
claim
determining
what
they
are
going
to
pay.
that's
correct.
now,
there
might
be--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
they
don't
know
whether
the
claims
are
disputed
or
not.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
let
me
give
an
example
where
we
would
agree.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
claims
are
not
disputed?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i'm
sorry.
could
you
ask
the
question--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
if
he
has
not
filed
the
claim,
our
position
would
be
the
same.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
mean,
we
believe
the
filing
of
the
claim
is
a--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
we
don't
think
so.
in
this
case,
because
of
the
way
they
run
their
plan,
it
may
have
that
effect,
because
they
say
that
as
soon
as
they
evaluate
the
claim
and
approve
it
they
immediately
send
out
a
check,
so
it
may
turn
out
to
be
the
same
thing,
but
they
don't
have
to
run
their
plan
that
way.
they
could
set
up
the
plan...
say
the
plan
provided
that
general
dynamics
has
to
make
reimbursement
within
90
days
of
when
the
claim
is
filed,
and
in
order
to
maximize
their
interest
they
in
fact
never
pay
the
claims
until
the
90
days
has
elapsed,
even
though
they
may
evaluate
them
within
ten
days
after
they
come
in.
now,
if
they
had
a
bunch
of
claims
that
had
been
evaluated
by
the
end
of
the
year,
by
december
31st,
and
they
knew
what
their
liability,
what
they
were
going
on
pay
on
that,
even
though
they
weren't
going
to
pay
it
for
another
three
months,
they
could
accrue
those
on
their
1972
tax
return
because
they
would
have
determined
the
liability
and
all
the
events
would
have
occurred
that
determined
the
amount
and
the
fact
that
the
liability--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
think
it
is
pretty
similar,
because
in
aaa
they
could...
it
was
clear
that
services
were
going
to
be
rendered
some
in
one
year
and
some
in
the
next
year,
and
they
were
trying
to
make
some
sort
of
estimate
of
when
the
services
will
be
rendered,
and
they
did
it,
and
here
it
is
clear
as
a
matter
of...
or
it
is
at
least
to
be
expected
as
a
matter
of
probability
that
there
were
some
people
who
went
to
the
doctor
during
1972
although
in
fact
they
don't
know
that.
as
far
as
they
know
it
is
possible
that
no
employee
went
to
the
doctor.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
first
of
all,
they
don't...
there
is
no
way
of
breaking
down
in
this
case
which
claims
have
been
presented
and
which
haven't,
so
i
am
not
sure
the
court
needs
to
get
to
that,
but
as
far
as
claims
that
haven't
been
presented,
but
if
you
assume
that
all
the
claims
had
been
presented
before
the
end
of
the
year
and
just
hadn't--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
then
you
get
to
the
question
of
how
significant
of
an
event
this
is,
that
they
have
to
evaluate
it,
and
our
position
is
that
in
this
case,
under
the
plan
that
they
have,
that
is
still
a
significant
event,
because
there
is
a
lot
of...
until
they
evaluate
the
the
claims
and
make
a
judgment
over
what
should
be
paid
there
is
a
lot
of
uncertainty
over
what
is
going
to
be
paid.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't,
as
we
state
in
our
reply
brief,
i
don't
read
that
as
a
finding
of
fact.
i
read
that
as
a
conclusion
of
law
as
to
how
the
all
events
test
should
be
applied.
it
is
clear
from...
it
is
clear
from
the
record--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
there
is
no
dispute
over
what
is
done--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
about
what
is
done
in
the
processing.
they
look
at
the
claims
and
they
determine
what
amount
is
going
to
be
paid.
now,
the
respondent's
claim
is
that
that
is
ministerial
in
the
sense
that
it
is
just
like
plugging
it
into
a
computer.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
don't
read
the
claims
court
finding
as
being
ministerial
in
the
sense
that
respondent
tries
to
use
it
here,
in
the
only
sense
that
it
would
be
relevant,
which
is
that
if
they
gave
these
claims
form
to
any
one
of
their
claims
processors
or
punched
it
into
a
computer
that
it
would
always
spit
out
the
same
answer.
that
is
clearly
not
the
case,
and
the
testimony
shows
that.
there
is
a
lot
of
room
for
judgment
in
what
claims
are
going
to...
on
what
amounts
are
going
to
be
paid
on
a
particular
claim,
and
in
respect
to
no
particular
individual
claim
can
it
be
said
until
that
claim
has
been
evaluated
and
approved
what
the
ultimate
liability
is
going
to
be
admitted
by
respondent.
the
testimony
shows
that
there
were
plenty
of
lawsuits
about
claim
denials.
testimony
shows
that
there
were
issues
such
as
whether
there
was
a
preexisting
condition,
whether
something
was
cosmetic
surgery,
whether
something
was
reasonable
or
customary
on
which
there
were
going
to
be
disputes.
now,
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
a
lot
of
the
claims
are
going
to
be
boilerplate
ones
on
which
there
will
be
no
dispute,
but
as
far
as
the
all
events
test
is
concerned,
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
a
sufficient
uncertainty
here
until
the
claim
is
evaluated
and
a
judgment
is
made
as
to
what
amount
should
be
paid,
that
the
last
event
is
still
necessary.
i
should
reiterate,
though,
that
it
is
really
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
get
that
far
here,
because
it
is
clear
that
the
previous
step,
the
filing
of
a
claim,
is
necessary
before
there
can
be...
before
there
can
be
any
obligation
on
respondent's
part
to
make
a
payment.
if
a
claim
is
never
filed
they
never
make
a
payment.
if
a
claim
is
filed
beyond
the
one-year
period
or
90-day
period
that
is
specified
in
the
plan,
they
said
they
sometimes
make
a
payment
but
they
are
not
obliged
to
do
so.
so
until
a
claim
is
filed,
we
don't
see
how
there
could
possibly
be
an
obligation
to
make
a
payment
that
would
justify
an
accrual.
and
since
they
have
not
broken
down
their
estimates
in
any
way
we
think
that
that
point
alone
is
dispositive
of
the
case,
and
it
is
not
really
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
the
second,
the
final
event
is
necessary.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
again,
i
think
that
is
a
legal
conclusion.
i
understand
that's
what
the
claims
court
said,
but
i
don't
think
that's
a
finding
of
fact,
that
the
obligation
is
fixed.
i
mean,
the
respondent
puts
that
in
a
statement
of
facts
and
cites
to
a
page
in
the
record
that
that
is
the
testimony
of
their
witness
that
the
obligation
is
fixed,
but
that
is
a
judgment
for
this
court
to
make,
not
for
respondent's
witness.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
is
not
fair.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
this
case
is
much
easier
for
us
than
the
slot
machine
case,
we
think.
it
had
better
be.
one
big
difference
between
this
and
the
slot
machine
case
is
the
point
i
started
to
make
a
little
while
ago,
and
that
is
that
in
the
slot
machine
case
there
was...
the
amount
that
the
casinos
were
trying
to
accrue
was
based
on
real
facts,
and
they
were
real
amounts,
real
individual
liabilities.
they
would
walk
around
the
casino
and
look
at
the
face
of
each
slot
machine
and
mark
down
what
the
amounts
were
on
the
machine,
and
they
could
say
that
we
have
a
liability
to
pay
that
amount.
now,
we
had
a
dispute
in
that
case
over
whether
there
was
still
a
contingency
outstanding,
but
there
is
no
question
that
they
had
a
liability
in
the
amount
on
the
machine
that
was
either
fixed
or
almost
fixed
but
still
contingent.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
they
had
a
liability
in
a
particular
amount
based
on
a
particular
fact.
now,
in
this
case,
in
this
case,
and
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
point,
and
i
am
not
sure
we
made
it
as
well
in
our
brief
as
we
might
have,
so
i
would
like
to
focus
the
court's
attention
on
it,
but
the
respondent
just
has,
they
just
take
a
historical
estimate.
they
are
not
looking...
they
claim
to
be
deducting
a
liability
and
expense,
but
the
number
that
they
attach
to
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
liability
really
is.
it
is
just
based
on
historical
evidence.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
explain.
we
don't
challenge
the
accuracy
of
the
estimate.
the
court
can
assume
that
the
estimate
has
landed
right
on
the
button
instead
of
$1
million
off,
but
it
is
just
impermissible
under
the
code
just
to
take
an
estimate
like
this.
what
they
have
done
is,
they
have
sort
of
skipped
the
all
events
test,
and
the
all
events
test...
i
guess
what
i
would
like
to
convey
to
the
court
is
what
a
radical
claim
they
are
really
making
in
this
case.
it
is
one
that
is
different
from
any
that
has
ever
been
made
in
any
of
these
accrual
accounting
cases
before,
and
that
is
why
i
think
we
allowed
ourselves
in
our
brief
to
fall
somewhat
into
the
trap
of
just
plugging
this
case
into
the
all
events
test,
but
you
can't
really
do
that
because
the
all
events
test
presupposes
that
the...
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
the
amount
that
respondent
seeks
to
deduct
is...
in
fact
represents
a
liability
and
whether
it
represents
a
fixed
liability,
and
the
all
events
test
kind
of
presupposes
that
that
amount
is
based
on
these
events
that
give
rise
to
the
liability,
and
then
the
all
events
test
looks
at
those
events
to
see
whether
they
create
a
sufficiently
fixed
liability.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
a
very
good
way
of
putting
it,
justice
scalia.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
they
don't
know
that
any
claim
is
out
there.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
they
are
just
estimating
historically,
and
they
can
do
almost
anything
if
they
are
allowed
to
get
away
with
that
kind
of
estimates.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
as
a
matter
of
probability,
surely
it
is
likely
there
is
going
to
be
some
liability,
sure.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
sure.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
that
is
not...
but
it's
misleading
to...
you
can't
just
look
at
the
all
events
test
and
say
there
is
a
liability
and
then
pick
another
number
out
of
somewhere
else
and
attach
it
to
that
liability.
they
have
got
to
go
together.
the
amount
that
you
are
trying
to
deduct
has
to
be
connected
to
the
liability
for
which
you
are
entitled
to
a
deduction.
this
all
sounds
very
abstract.
i
would
really
like
to
try
to
make
it
a
little
more
concrete
by
giving
an
example,
but
let
me
try
to
give
an
example
of
a
case
where
i
think
respondent's
plan
would
satisfy
the
all
events
test
if
they
had
computed
their
deduction
in
the
proper
way.
let's
assume
that
it
was
really
ministerial,
that
the
plan
was
just
one
line,
and
it
said
for
every
doctor
bill
that
is
submitted,
every
doctor
bill
that
is
submitted
to
us,
we
will
pay
$10
reimbursement.
now,
at
the
end
of
the
year,
and
let's
assume
further
that
it
still
takes
them
a
long
time
to
process
these
claims
because
they
like
to
keep
all
these
various
statistics
about
what
is
going
on,
but
every
doctor
bill
is
going
to
be
paid
off
for
$10.
well,
at
the
end
of
a
year
they
may
have
a
stack
of
100
bills
that
have
been
submitted
to
them,
100
claims
sitting
in
a
little
desktop.
now,
if
they
went
through
and
counted
up
those
claims
we
would
agree
that
they
could
accrue
a
$1,000
deduction
because
they
would
know
that
they
have
100
claims
and
they
are
going
to
be
paid
at
$10
apiece,
even
if
they
don't
pay
them
until
later,
so
we
would
agree
that
they
could
take
a
$1,000
deduction
at
that
point,
but
we
would
not
agree
that
they
could
go
back,
look
at
their
history
of
what
their
claims
were
like
in
1970,
come
up
with
some
predicted
number
for
what
claims
they
were
going
to
have
sitting
in
their
box
at
the
end
of
year
end
1972
and
take
some
actuarial
estimate,
which
might
be
$1,000,
might
be
$1,100,
might
be
$900.
they
can't
do
that.
that
is
not...
that
is
not
a
liability
that
could
be
accrued.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
not
necessarily.
they
would
not.
if
the
next
year
they
were--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--but,
you
see,
they
are
taking
the
deduction
for
the
reserve.
they
are
not
taking
the
deduction
for
the
payments.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
so
the
reserve
is,
if
the
court
would
hold
that
it
was
reasonably
accurate,
the
reserve
was
right,
and
so
their
1972
deduction
would
still
be
good.
now,
the
reserve
is
kind
of
self-correcting
over
time,
so
the
next
year
they
would
have
only
$4.5
million
in
payments
and
that
would
already
leave
$1
million
left
in
the
reserve.
if
they
found
that
they
were
consistently
overestimating
they
would
probably
have
to
reduce
the
reserve
in
later
years,
and
that
would
have
the
effect,
especially
if
they
had
to
in
later
years--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
that
would
get
back
to
the
reasonable
estimate--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--business,
but
i
mean,
the
nature
of
reserving
accounting
is
that
if
they
keep
accruing
too
much
at
some
point
they
are
not
to
be
adding
to
the...
in
the
first
year
you
just
take
the
amount
of
the
reserve.
after
that
the
deduction
goes
for
an
addition
to
the
reserve
to
get
it
back
up
to
where
it
belongs.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right,
at
some
point
it
corrects
itself,
and
if
you
have
to
reduce
the
reserves
later
you
will
take
it
into
income
in
a
later
year,
but
that
is--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
they
did.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
they
could
not
do
that,
no,
but
that
is
the
closest--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
they
know
as
a
matter
of
statistics?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
if
they
can't
say
that
any
single
one
of
them
is
a
valid
claim,
then
our
position
would
be
that
the
all
events
test
does
not
permit
them
to
do
that,
but
i
think
that
is
the
closest
question
in
this
case,
and
that
is
really
the
third
ground
on
why
their
position
is
wrong,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
get
to
it.
the
first
ground
is
that
they
are
not...
they
just
can't
take
an
estimation
like
this
that
is
not
related
to
the
actual
facts
involved,
and
the
second
ground
is
that
the
claim
has
not
been
filed,
and
if
you
get
past
those
two
hurdles,
then
i
think
on
the
third
ground,
although
that
is
our
position,
i
think
that
is
the
most
difficult
question
that
is
presented
to
the
court.
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
also
in
the
manner
of
an
example
about
the
milwaukee
case
which
was
discussed
in
our
brief,
the
case
that
was
up
to
this
court
once
and
back
to
the
seventh
circuit,
because
the
factual
similarities
there,
i
think,
kind
of
illuminate
what
is
going
on
here.
the
milwaukee
case
involved
an
attempt
by
the
milwaukee
transit
authority
to
take
a
deduction
for
estimates
of
what
it
was
going
to
have
to
pay
out
on
accident
claims
for
accidents
that
it
had
in
a
particular...
in
a
taxable
year.
they
went
through
and
found
that
they
had
about
400
some
accident
reports
from
their
drivers.
they
went
through
these
accident
reports
one
by
one
and
made
an
estimate
of
what
they
thought
their
liability
was
on
each
accident
report.
in
fact,
the
record
says
that
the
attorneys
were
authorized
to
settle
the
cases
for
that
amount.
and
then
they
totaled
up
all
their
estimated
liabilities
for
these
accidents
and
set
up
a
reserve
account
to
pay
for
them,
and
tried
to
deduct
that
in
that
year.
the
seventh
circuit
originally
allowed
this
deduction.
it
stated
that
it
was
clear
that
each
individual
liability
here
was
not
accruable
because
it
was
contingent,
it
was
contested,
a
well
established
proposition,
but
it
held
that
all
of
them
lumped
together
were
statistically
accurate
enough
that
they
could
be
deducted.
now,
this
court
vacated
that
decision
in
light
of
aaa,
sent
it
back
to
the
seventh
circuit,
which
agreed
that
aaa
made
that
decision
wrong.
now,
i
think
what
is
important
to
note
here,
respondent
dismisses
this
case
by
saying
that,
well,
it
is
well
established
that
these
were
contested
liabilities,
and
so
therefore
you
can't
accrue
them,
but
if
respondent's
position
here
is
correct,
if
they
can
use
this
estimation,
than
milwaukee
will
be
able
to
take
these
kinds
of
deductions
because
they
will
just
step
it
back
one
step
the
same
way
respondent
has
done
here.
they
won't
even
bother
to
look
at
each
individual
claim
and
leave
themselves
open
to
the
possibility
that
it
is
contested.
they
will
just
take
some
actuarial
estimate
of
what
their
accident
liability
is
based
on
past
experience
for
a
given
year,
and
they
will
take
a
deduction
for
that,
and
they
will
be
able
to
do
it
the
same
way
that
general
dynamics
does
it
here
if
in
fact
the
court
approves
this
method.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
will
use
a
few
more,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
there
is
a
fixed
obligation
to
pay
the
amount
that
the
respondent
is
seeking
to
deduct.
that
includes
a
couple
of
things,
and
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
whether
or
not
they
know,
they
could
know
something
about
the
claims
by
going
to
see
what
is
sitting
in
their
in
box
or
taking
a
survey
of
their
employees
is
not
relevant
here
because
the
number
that
they
computed
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
that
knowledge.
that
number
is
purely
a
historical
estimate
and
would
be
the
same
even
if
they
had
no
knowledge.
now,
our
position
is
that
you
cannot
do
that,
and
that
you
don't
even
get
into
the
all
events
test.
that
is
an
impermissible
means
of
doing
it.
if
they
did
go
around
to
all
their
employees
and
surveyed
them
as
to
what
claims
they
had
outstanding
or
what
claims
they
were
going
to
be
filing
next
year
or
something,
then
this
would
be
a
different
case.
then
we
would
not
be
raising
that
first
objection,
and
then
we
would
get
into
the
second
part
of
our
contention,
which
is
whether
the
all
events
test
in
fact
is
satisfied
here.
and
our
position
there
is
that
it
is
not.
there
is
no
fixed
obligation
to
pay
at
the
time
that
the
employee
goes
to
the
doctor.
the
employee
may
have
an
obligation
to
pay
the
doctor.
the
employee
may
have
a
right
to
seek
reimbursement
from
the
employer,
but
the
employer
has
no
obligation
to
pay
anything
to
the
employee
until
the
employee
files
a
claim.
now,
there
is...
in
a
sense
there
is
a
legal
liability
in
the
way
that
lawyers
are
used
to
talking
about
it,
which
is
that
ultimately
down
the
road
there
may
be
a
lawsuit
brought
at
which
the
employee
will
recover
something
and
the
liability
that
results
in
this
recovery
dates
back
to
when
he
went
to
the
doctor.
but
that
is
not
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
we
are
talking
about
a
fixed
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
make
the
payment,
and
that
just
does
not
exist
at
that
time.
it
does
not
exist
until
the
next
year.
on
this
business
of
whether
we
have
waived
our
entire
case
by
not
raising
the
second
issue
in
the
petition,
there
is
a
big
difference
between
the
accuracy
point,
which
is
just
whether
the
bottom
line
is
correct
or
not,
and
the
question
of
whether
the
method
by
which
this
amount
is
computed
is
legitimate,
and
i
think
as
the
court
has
said
that
goes
to
the
fact
of
the
liability.
that
goes
to
the
essence
of
the
all
events
test,
and
we
certainly
do
not
agree
that
this
is
a
permissible
method
for
using...
for
using
to
reach
this
deduction.
the
all
events
test
as
first
stated
by
justice
brandeis,
and
i
don't
think
the
regulation
was
intended
to
change
it,
says
that
all
the
events
must
occur
which
fix
the
amount
and
determine
the
liability
of
the
taxpayer
to
pay
it.
the
two
are
entwined
together,
and
here
the
amount
that
they
are
seeking
to
deduct
just
comes
out
of
the
air.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
events
on
which
they
claim
there
is
fixed
liability.
and
it
has
to.
in
order
to
apply
the
all
events
test
you
have
to
have...
be
computing
the
amount
based
on
the
real
events
that
are
there.
if
there
are
any
questions--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
go
ahead.
