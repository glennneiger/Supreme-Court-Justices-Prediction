justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask,
suppose
that
this
estimate...
suppose
you
lose
this
case,
but
also
suppose
that
their
estimate
was
off,
that
they
had
overaccrued.
would
they
have
to
take
something
back
into
income
the
next
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
took
a
deduction,
they
accrued
a
deduction
that
exceeded
what
their...
what
their
actual
liability
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
might...
the
next
year
the
service
might
say
you
are
accruing
too
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
deductibles?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you...
is
it
your
position
that
you
could
just
use
historical
evidence
as
to
what
the
deduction
should
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
know
what
medical
services
have
been
performed
during
the
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about...
but
aren't
there
some
people
you
deduct
for
who
have
just
received
medical
services
but
no
claim
has
been
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
that
they
have
received
medical
services?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
all
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
just
estimate
that
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
how
did
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
the
fact
remains
that
when
you
arrived
at
this
figure
you
deducted
you
estimated
how
much
medical
services.
you
just
didn't
know
all
of
the
medical
services
that
had
been
provided.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
could
just
estimate...
well,
if
that
is
true,
then
you
don't
need
to
know
that
any.
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
pick
out
a
historical
figure.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
are
saying
if
there
is
a
challenge
to
our
deduction
and
you
had
a
proceeding
by
that
time
you
would
know
exactly
how
much
medical
services
had
been
provided
and
you
could
then
say
that
really
established
the
fact
of
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
also
said
xxx
employees
will
have
been
to
the
doctor
or
were
to
the
doctor
by
the
end
of
the
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
goes
to
liability,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
know
that.
how
do
you
know
that
he
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
commissioner
came
in
and
audited
you
and
you
had
claimed
this
deduction
and
he
looked
over
your
books,
and
it
turned
out
that
all
of
these
medical
services
that
you
had
estimated
had
been
performed
never
were
performed,
it
would
be
like
the
person...
like
the
company
whose
employees
didn't
fly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
did,
if
he
did,
he
would
disallow
your
deduction.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
guessing
as
to
how
much
liability
there
is.
