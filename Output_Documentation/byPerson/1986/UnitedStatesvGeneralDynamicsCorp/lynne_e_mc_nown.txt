ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
when
it
is
proper
to
take
a
deduction
for
the
liability
that
the
taxpayers
have
for
medical
benefits
provided
to
their
employees.
the
government
presupposes
the
answer
by
saying
that
this
is
a
future
contingent
liability
which
we
are
trying
to
deduct
at
the
end
of
1972.
first,
i
would
like
to
keep
in
mind
the
difference
between
the
cash
basis
and
the
accrual
basis
of
accounting.
the
cash
basis
of
accounting
for
a
deduction
requires
actual
payment
of
the
claim.
that
is
clear.
the
accrual
basis
of
accounting
doesn't
require
payment,
it
requires
that
there
be
an
established
liability,
and
that
is
typically
prior
to
payment
of
the
item.
now,
there
are
two
parts
to
the
all
events
test.
both
parts
have
to
be
met
in
order
to
take
the
deduction.
the
first
part
of
the
test
is
that
all
events
have
occurred
which
establish
the
fact
of
liability.
the
second
part
of
the
test
is
that
the
amount
has
to
be
determinable
with
reasonable
accuracy.
they
are
two
separate
tests.
they
both
have
to
be
met
in
order
to
take
the
deduction.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
we
do
accept
the
application
of
that
test.
that
test
was
enunciated
first
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
anderson
in
1926.
it
has
been
with
us
for
a
very
long
time.
it
was
put
in
the
treasury
regulations,
and
it
has
been
referred
to
by
this
court.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
true.
but
that
was
the
birthplace--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--it
is
clearly
the
test,
and
it
was
reaffirmed
by
this
court
just
last
term
in
the
hughes
properties
decision.
now,
the
only
issue
that
is
before
this
court
is
the
liability
issue,
whether
all
events
have
occurred
which
establish
the
fact
of
liability.
the
amount
issue
i
respectfully
submit
is
not
before
this
court.
the
solicitor
general
is
attempting
after
the
fact
to
put
part
of
that
issue
before
this
court,
saying,
we
object
to
how
they
computed
their
number.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
there
is
some
interrelation
between
the
tests
in
certain
cases,
but
they
are
two
distinct
requirements.
you
can
meet
one
requirement
of
the
test
and
fail
the
second.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
if
these
are
uncontested
claims.
in
milwaukee
suburban
transport
these
were
contested
claims.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
okay.
if
you
have
an
accident
and
you
know
you
are
liable
and
you
are
not
contesting
that
liability,
if
you...
the
fact
of
liability
has
been
established.
the
events
which
establish
liability
happened
when
your
bus
driver
ran
over
somebody.
that
is
part
1
of
the
test.
part
2
of
the
test
is
whether
or
not
you
can
determine
the
amount
of
that
liability
with
reasonable
accuracy.
if
you
can
you
are
entitled
to
deduct
it.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
even
though
you
haven't
paid
it.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
if
you
couldn't
come
up
with
a
reasonable
estimate
of
what
that
liability
is
you
would
not
be
able
to
deduct
it
because
you
have
to
satisfy
both
parts
of
the
test.
failing
one,
whichever
it
is,
results
in
no
deduction.
now,
the
government
in
saying
that
they
object
to
the
method
by
which
this
is--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--i
think
contesting
the
amount
of
the
liability
is
sufficient
contest
to
dispute
the
claim.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
you
can
dispute
either
the
basic
underlying
liability
or
the
amount
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
pay
to
the
person.
the
dispute
becomes
on
either
one
of
those
issues
on
a--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--the
prospects
of
disputes
in
tort
claims
and
personal
injury
claims
are
so
substantial
that
the
courts
have
looked
very
askance
at
those
claims
because
they
foresee
contests,
but
we
aren't
talking--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--i
think
you
would
have
to
on
a
case
by
case
basis
look
at
those
situations
to
see
if
the
taxpayer
never
contests
them
and
always
pays
out,
i
don't
see
the
fact
that
it
is
a
tort
claim
with
no
contest
either
on
liability
or
amount
would
mean
you
could
not
deduct
it,
but
that
is
not
ordinarily
what
happens
in
tort
claims.
they
are
usually
contested
in
some
fashion.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
if
there
are
contests
you
cannot
deduct
the
liability
at
the
opening.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
there
are
not
substantial
medical
claims
that
are
contested.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
taxpayers
have
put
in
an
employee
benefit
plan.
they
are
interested
in
good
employee
relations.
they
have
agreed
in
advance.
we
are
willing
to
pay
the
amounts
that
are
set
forth
in
this
plan
to
any
employee
who
receives
these
benefits
while
employed
by
the
company.
these
plans
are
very
specific.
they
are
very
detailed.
they
state,
for
instance,
under
basic
medical,
we
will
pay
you
$60
a
day
for
your
room
and
board
charge
at
the
hospital.
we
will
pay
you
$200
for
an
appendectomy.
the
major
medical
benefits
which
are
provided
are
equally
specific.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
there
is
typically
on
the
major
medical
a
$100
deductible.
the
government
says
the
deductible
applies
across
the
board.
the
deductible
does
not
apply
to
the
basic
medical
plan,
but
these
plans
are
very
specific.
it
is
clear
to
the
administrators
and
to
the
employees
in
the
booklets
that
are
provided
that
the
plans
do
not
pay
100
percent
of
gross
medical
costs
incurred,
and
therefore,
while
the
government
suggested
in
the
trial
below
that
the
fact
that
the
plans
don't
pay
100
percent
of
gross
medical
amounts,
that
somehow
this
means
they
are
contests.
that
is
just
not
true.
it
is
not
true
as
a
fact.
it
is
not
true
analytically.
if
somebody
goes
on
business
travel
and
his
employer
says,
we
pay
coach
air
fare,
and
the
employee
goes
out
and
says,
well,
i
am
going
to
go
first
class,
if
the
company
policy
is,
we
pay
coach,
when
he
submits
his
bill
and
the
company
pays
him
the
coach
fare
instead
of
the
first
class
fare,
that
doesn't
provoke
litigation.
it
doesn't
provoke
contest.
it
is
very
clear
what
that
plan
is
going
to
provide.
the
trial
court
correctly
analyzed
this
situation
and
determined,
rightfully,
we
say,
that
not
paying
what
is
not
a
covered
benefit
is
not
a
contest,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
that
engendered
contest.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
no,
we
do
not
just
use
historical
evidence
on
the
deduction.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
we
know
at
the
end
of
the
year
that
a...
we
know
specific
information
for
all
of
those
employees
for
whom
claims
have
been
filed,
and
there
are
employees
for
whom
a
claim
has
been
filed
with
the
company.
it
has
got
the
name,
it
has
got
the
background
information
and
the
doctor's
bill.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
there
are
also
people
for
whom
no
claim
is
filed.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
some
of
those
people
we
do
know
have
received
medical
services.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
but
not
all
of
them.
for
instance,
hospitals--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--we
have
56,000
employees.
we
pay
millions
of
dollars
of
medical
benefits
every
year.
i
submit
there
is
no
three-month
period
where
these
people
are
not
submitting
bills.
also--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--we
do
know
many
of
the
claims
are
there.
for
instance--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--if
people
are
out
of
work
we
probably
know
that,
but
knowledge
is
not
required.
we
could
know
it.
the
facts
exist.
these
people,
the
gentleman
who
has
been
to
the
doctor
in
the
first
week
of
december
for
an
office
visit,
surgical
procedure
has
been
there.
we
know
that
we
could
collect
that
information.
if
we
walked
the
floor,
like
in
the
casino,
if
we
walked
the
floor
and
had
supervisors
go
out
and
ask
every
employee,
have
you
been
to
the
doctor,
we
would
get
answers.
we
would
get
answers
from
specific
people
about
specific
doctor
visits,
about
specific
procedures
which
were
approved.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
and
that
is
very
different
than
not
having
any
knowledge
at
all.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
we
didn't
in
fact
know
all
the
medical
services
provided,
but
that
knowledge
isn't
required.
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
hughes--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--well,
there
are
two
issues.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
fact
of
liability
has
occurred.
since
the
employees
have
been
to
the
doctor,
they
have
been
to
the
hospital
and
received
services,
the
fact
of
liability
has
occurred.
the
rule
doesn't
require
that
we
know
each
instance
in
which
it
has
occurred.
for
instance,
in
a
unilateral
contract
we
say
i
will
pay
joe
blow
to
go
to
philadelphia,
and
joe
goes
to
philadelphia
on
the
last
day
of
the
year.
when
he
goes
to
philadelphia
the
contract,
the
unilateral
contract
has
matured,
and
we
have
an
obligation.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
we
may
not
know.
he
hasn't
called
us
up.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
oh,
we
know
much
sooner
than
that.
the
vast
majority
of
these
claims
come
in
in
the
first
three
months
of
the
subsequent
year.
the
record
shows
that
the
payments
of
the
claims
that
occurred
in
1972,
$4.5
million
occurred
in
1973,
and
$80,000
occurred
in
1974.
these
claims
come
in
very
quickly.
they
are
paid
promptly.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
that
is
correct.
but
in
hughes
property
where
you
had
the
slot
machine
case
and
the
progressive
jackpots,
there
was
no
winner
at
year
end.
you
had
amounts
which
were
on
specific--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--i
think
it
is
much
more
certain
in
this
case
that
we...
we
have
winners.
in
this
case
people
have
been
to
the
doctor.
they
have
pulled
the
handle.
they
haven't
stepped
up
to
the
window
and
said,
pay
me.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
but
they
have
won.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
well,
i
submit
we
are
easier
than
the
hughes
case
because
we
could
go
out
and
find
those
employees.
they
exist.
they
are
in
the...
in
the
factories,
in
the
offices.
in
the
slot
machine
case
nobody
had
won
and
you
didn't
know
when
that
machine
would
be
played
and
when
the
handle
would
come
down.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
going
around
and
looking
at
the
machines
went
to
the
second
issue
in
that
case.
it
went
to
the
amount
issue.
it
went
to
can
they
determine
their
amount
with
reasonable
accuracy,
and
by
reading
the
machines
they
could
in
that
case.
but
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
well,
i
think
that
in
this
case
the
information
that
we
do
know,
the
facts
that
do
exist
are
sufficient
that
this
court
can
find
that
there
is
fact
of
liability.
the
issue,
we
have
employees
who
have
actually
been
to
the
doctor.
they
have
received
the
services.
the
plans
exist.
when
the
claims
come
in
it
is
a
ministerial
process
to
figure
out
the
benefits.
it
is
not
a
judgmental,
a
difficult
procedure
which
any
claims
administrator
has
to
get
into.
it
is
very
routine.
it
is
very
ordinary,
and
it
is
like
paying
the
travel
expense
where
the
employee
gets
on
the
plane
and
has
a
coach
air
fare
ticket,
and
comes
back.
he
has
to
submit
an
expense
voucher.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
i
think
that
goes
to
the
issue
of
reasonable
amount.
if
you
can
determine
with
reasonable
accuracy
what
the
amount
of
the
travel
expense
reimbursement
is,
you
can
deduct
that
amount.
if
you
can't
determine
the
reasonable
amount,
then
your
deduction
would
fail
because
you
haven't
satisfied
the
second
part
of
the
test,
but
the
fact
of
liability,
has
an
employee
gone
out
and
got
on
that
airplane,
and
are
you
going
to
be
liable
to
reimburse
for
the
airplane
ticket,
has
occurred,
and
the
procedures
by
which
the
processing
and
the
amounts
are
going
to
occur
have...
are
in
place.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
i
think
the
commissioner
would
say
that
that
accrual
at
the
end
of
that
year
was
not
a
reasonably
determined
amount
and
would
challenge
the
deduction
on
exactly
that
basis,
and
it
would
fail
on
that
basis.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
no,
it...
all
right,
that
is
true.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
yes.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
yes.
but
we
don't
have
nonexistent
travelers
in
our
case.
we
have--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--that
is
correct.
but
the--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--no,
because
here
when
the
year
ends
nobody
submits
their
expense
voucher
because
there
aren't
any
expense
vouchers.
here
there
are
expense
vouchers
because
there
are
employees.
we
have
claims
that
have
been
filed
and
will
be
completed
for
processing.
we
have
claims--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--the
claims
that
haven't
been
filed
will
come
in.
they
do
come
in,
and
we
paid
$4.5
million
of
them.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
the
insurance
companies
are
a
whole
separate
industry
which
has
many
different
accounting
provisions
and
many
different
income
provisions.
congress
has
chosen
to
set
up
a
special
section
of
the
code
to
deal
with
the
whole
taxation
of
insurance
companies.
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
done
that
does
not
mean
that
taxpayers
who
are
not
insurance
companies
applying
the
test
that
is
applicable
to
noninsurance
company
taxpayers,
namely,
the
all
events
test,
cannot
deduct
an
item
because
it
is
also
an
item
which
an
insurance
company
might
deduct.
there
is
no--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--on
health
and
benefit
claims
i
think
the
all
events
test
would
satisfy
the
liability...
the
reserving
requirement
for
insurance
companies.
i
think
that
they
had
only
the
all
events
test
for
a
medical
benefit
plan
like
the
gd
medical
plan
and
that
is
what
we
are
locking
at
in
this
case,
they
would
not
need
special
statutory
provisions
in
order
to
authorize
a
deduction.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
it
does.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
it
does.
casualty
cases,
contested
cases,
that...
the
regulation
for
insurance
companies
is
all
pervasive
for
that
industry,
and
the
fact
that
there
are
some
items
of
overlap
does
not
prove
to
me,
i
submit
it
is
not
logical
to
say
that
that
means
ordinary
business
taxpayers
who
satisfy
the
ordinary
business
rules
can't
take
their
ordinary
deductions.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
i
believe
there
was,
and
there
has
been
a
constant
fight
and
reanalysis
over
insurance
company
taxation
throughout
the
years
before
congress.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
government,
while
it
says
that
the
dollar
amount
of
the
reserve
on
the
second
issue
is
not
before
the
court,
it
somehow
suggests
that
the
aggregate
basis
of
determining
the
reserve
is.
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
the
government
stated
at
page
13,
footnote
2,
we
are
not
presenting
for
review
here
the
question
of
respondent's
ability
to
satisfy
the
second
part
of
the
all
events
test.
it
didn't
we
are
not
submitting
part
of
it.
it
said
we
are
not
submitting
the
issue
of
their
ability
to
satisfy
the
second
part
of
the
all
events
test.
and
that
is
the
reasonable
amount
portion
of
the
test.
so
the
only
issue
that
is
before
the
court
is
whether
the
fact
of
liability
exists.
now,
in
our
case
the
government,
the
authorities
of
this
court
support
that
claims
processing
does
not
preclude
deductibility.
starting
with
the
anderson
case
in
1916,
there
a
tax
was
imposed
on
the
sale
of
munitions,
and
the
taxpayer
said,
i
think
that
the
time
to
deduct
the
tax
on
munitions
is
in
1917.
at
year
end
1916
the
munitions
had
been
sold,
the
tax
statute
existed,
but
the
tax
had
not
been
assessed.
i
expect
the
return
hadn't
been
filed.
the
year
had
to
close
before
you
could
file
your
tax
return.
yet
the
government,
contrary
to
its
position
here,
said
no,
the
munitions
tax
for
1916
should
be
accrued
in
1916
even
though
it
is
not
assessed,
even
though
it
is
not
due,
and
this
court
agreed
with
that
and
determined
that
while
technically
tax
had
not
been
assessed
and
wasn't
due,
in
a
practical
sense,
in
a
realistic
sense
all
of
the
events
establishing
that
liability
had
occurred.
that
failure
to
need
a
tax
assessment
shows
that
paper
processing
such
as
involved
in
this
case
is
not
the
kind
of
paper
processing
which
requires
that
fixation
and
liability
await
the
end
of
paper
processing.
the
government
said
in
its
argument
that
it
is
a
very
difficult
process,
and
they
cited
preexisting
conditions
and
they
cited
prevailing
rates
and
said
in
the
court
below
we
show
this
is
a
difficult
process.
it
is
an
iffy
process.
the
record
in
the
court
below
is
totally
to
the
contrary.
evidence
was
presented
before
the
trial
court
on
exactly
what
happened
in
claims
processing.
those
very
kinds
of
situations,
prevailing
rates,
preexisting
conditions
were
testified
to
by
claims
processors,
and
these
witnesses
testified
that
while
terms
which
may
be
unfamiliar
to
you
or
i
or
other
laymen
are
not
unfamiliar
to
the
claims
processors
and
they
handle
these
conditions
on
a
routine
basis,
applying
the
plans
in
mass
volume
numbers,
and
it
doesn't
cause
processing
problems
at
all.
now,
the
government
at
page
7
and
8
of
their
reply
brief
suggest
that
the
same
example
of
a
per
diem
charge
for
a
medical
benefit
for
a
hospital
stay
will
result
in
different
answers
if
you
present
it
to
different
processors.
that
is
just
not
correct.
the
government
looks
to
an
example
in
the
respondent's
brief
at
pages
22
and
23.
the
example
posed
was
a
simple,
basic
medical
plan
that
paid
$60
a
day
for
room
and
board
charges
in
a
hospital.
the
employee
is
there
for
three
days.
he
is
entitled
to
$180.
the
government
says,
oh,
another
processor
could
come
up
with
$210,
and
their
citation
for
support
of
that
is
testimony
by
a
witness
who
is
talking
about
a
plan
that
has
not
only
a
basic
medical
feature,
it
has
also
a
major
medical
feature.
and
the
addition
of
the
major
medical
feature
means
that
additional
dollars
are
paid
to
the
employee,
but
if
you
have
got
two
different
plans
you
will
have
two
different
results
on
the
same
facts.
if
you
have
the
same
plan,
a
basic
medical
plan,
two
or
more
processors
will
indeed
reach
the
same
determination
as
to
what
the
benefits
are
that
are
due
to
that
employee.
if
you
add
another
tier
of
benefits,
you
will,
of
course,
get
a
different
answer,
but
you
have
got
a
different
medical
plan
that
is
at
issue.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
under
the
record
in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
am
not...
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that.
there
has
been
some
developing
law
in
terms
of
what
coordination
occurs,
i
think,
with
government
plans.
but
in
the
private
sector,
in
the
private
sector
there
are
specific
rules
as
to
who
pays
what
benefits
first,
and
there
is
coordination
of
benefits
so
there
is
not
excess
payments
to
employees
above
and
beyond
their
out
of
pocket
costs.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
claims
processing
was
in
any
way
delayed.
the
claims
processing
was
handled
routinely.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
claims
were
withheld
in
order
to
delay
the
payment
of
the
liability
and,
as
the
government
suggests,
maybe
get
interest
on
the
money.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
that
in
the
record
at
all.
the
liabilities
that
are
before
this
court
in
this
plan
are
real
liabilities
to
real
people.
the
government,
by
saying
that
they
want
the
process
to
wait
until
claims
processing
is
completed,
until
the
taxpayers
are
just
ready
to
write
the
check
and
put
it
in
the
mail,
does
considerable
violence
to
the
all
events
test.
it
substantially
seeks
retrenchment
of
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
anderson,
and
it
really
ignores
everyday
life
in
the
world
today.
there
is
paper
processing
for
many,
many
things,
and
if
routine
paper
processing
of
the
type
that
was
at
issue
in
this
case
is
required
in
order
to
take
an
accrual
deduction,
it
will
go
substantially
towards
making
accrual
basis
taxpayers
function
for
expenses
on
the
cash
basis.
in
conclusion,
the
benefit
payments
that
were
made
in
this
case
on
a
practical,
reasonable
basis
show
that
the
events
that
established
the
fact
of
liability
had
occurred
when
the
employee
had
been
to
the
doctor.
at
that
stage
the
taxpayers
could
not
remove
the
liability.
they
could
not
terminate
the
plan.
they
could
not
reduce
the
benefits.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
but
that
goes
to
the
second
issue
of
the
test.
the
second
issue
requires
an
estimation
of
determination
of
what
the
amount
is.
but
at
the
end
of
the
year,
for
the
employee
who
went
to
the
doctor
in
the
first
week
of
december--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--no,
the
employee
is
there,
he
has
been
to
the
doctor--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--in
the
case
where
he
hasn't
filed
a
claim,
if
we
don't
have
the
knowledge
we
don't
specifically
know
that,
but
if
he
has
been
there
we
cannot
by
january
1
say
we
aren't
going
to
pay
your
claim
because
you
didn't
get
it
on
file
by
january
1,
and
we
are
going
to
stop
paying
claims.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
in
this
case,
when
the
commissioner
would
come
in
and
look
he
would
not
find
that
services
were
not
performed.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
if
he
found
there
were
no
services
performed,
he
would
disallow
the
deduction,
and
since
fact
of
liability
would
not
have
existed--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--we
would
not
be
entitled
to--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--we
are
estimating
the
amount
of
the
liability.
that
is
correct.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
given
all
the
facts
that
we
know
and
the
repetitive
nature
of
these
claims
coming
in
and
the
size
of
our--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--it
is
no
more
an
estimation
than
occurred
in
hughes,
i
submit.
in
hughes
the
slot
machine
had
not
been
played
and
won.
the
nevada
gaming
regulations
said
you
couldn't
reverse
the
amount
on
the
machine.
but
there
wasn't
a
winner.
in
this
case
we
have
all
these
employees.
they
are
winners.
if
these
businesses
went
out
of
business,
if
they
went
bankrupt,
there
would
be
thousands
of
employees.
everybody
who
had
been
to
the
doctor
would
come
in
and
submit
their
claim
and
say
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
pay
this
claim,
you
can't
relieve
the
taxpayers
of
this
liability.
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
that's
correct.
for
the
first
part
of
the
test--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--for
the
first
part
of
the
test--
ms.
lynne
e.
mc
nown
--that's
correct,
and
as
long
as...
and
the
knowledge
is
not
necessary
for
part
1.
it
may
factor
into
our
ability
to
determine
a
reasonable
amount
under
point
2,
the
amount
issue
of
the
all
events
test.
thank
you,
your
honor.
