justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
horowitz,
the
aaa
case,
it
does
have
some
nice
language
in
it,
but
really
the
court
wasn't
addressing
the
kind
of
situation
we
have
here.
wasn't
it
the
case
there
that
it
was
undisputed
that
the
services
had
not
yet
been
rendered
in
the
year
in
question?
they
hadn't
been
asked
for
in
the
year
in
question.
wasn't
it
an
attempt
to
estimate
what
services
would
be
demanded
the
next
year,
whereas
here
you
still
have
an
estimation,
to
be
sure,
but
what
is
being
estimated
is
not
what
will
be
demanded
in
the
future
but
what
liability
has
already
been
incurred
this
year,
if
you
accept
the
fact
that
liability
exists
before
the
actual
demand
is
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
claims
that
have
already
been
presented?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
suppose
we
had
nothing
but
claims
that
had
been
presented,
the
only
step
left
is
that
the
company
hasn't
evaluated
them
and
decided
that
it
will
pay,
but
they
have
been
presented,
so
the
last
act
that
the
claimant
has
to
take
has
been
taken.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
they
had
a
liability.
xxx
if
they
had
a
liability
if
they
had
a
liability.
the
only
question
about
it
was
its
contingency.
i
don't...
that
doesn't
make
too
much
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
you
are
saying
is
that
in
these
other
cases
what
is
estimated
is
the
amount
of
the
liability,
whereas
what
is
being
estimated
here
is
the
very
existence
of
the
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
really
know
that
any
particular
claim
is
out
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
just
estimate
that
a
certain
number
of
claims
are
out
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
go
back
to
your
simple
example
there
where...
suppose
they
didn't
pay
out
$10
on
each
doctor's
bill,
there
was
some
element
of
qualification
in
order
to
get
paid.
they
know
that...
and
they
go
and
count
all
the
bills,
and
they
have
a
long
history
that
90
percent
of
all
of
the
bills
are
approved,
and
they
have
done
that
for
years
and
years.
or
make
it
even
95
percent.
so
they
add
up
all
of
these
submitted
doctors'
bills
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
then
they
try
to
accrue
95
percent.
you
wouldn't
let
them
do
that,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
99
percent.
even
if
they
know
from
past
experience
that
all
except
one
bill
will
be
approved
in
its
totality,
you
would
still
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
this
whole
stack
of
bills
they
cannot
say
categorically
that
any
single
one
of
those
is
definitely
a
claim,
is
definitely
a
valid
claim,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go
on,
what
do
you
mean
by
an
uncontested
claim?
suppose
i
acknowledge
that
i
am
liable
in
the
chief
justice's
example.
i
acknowledge
that
the
company
is
liable
for
the
consequences
of
the
bus
accident,
but
i
very
much
contest
whether
particular
injuries
were
attributable
to
the
accident
and
so
forth,
so
i
really
don't
know
what
the
amount...
i
don't...
i
do
contest
the
amount
of
my
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
dispute
the
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you
don't
dispute
it
but
you
just
don't
know
it?
i
mean,
in
the
example
the
chief
justice
gave
the
company
just
didn't
know
what
the
amount
was.
i
can
hardly
contest
it
until
somebody
makes
me
an
offer,
tells
me
a
number
that
i
can
contest.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
treat
that
like
a
contested
one,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
guessing
the
claims
exist.
you
are
not
just
guessing
about
the
amount
of
the
claims.
you
are
guessing
on
the
basis
of
historical
experience
that
claims
exist.
you
cannot
categorically
come
in
and
lay
your
life
on
the
line
and
say
there
are
claims
and
here
are
the
people
that
have
them.
you
don't
know
who
the
people
are.
you
don't
really
know
for
sure
that
the
claims
are
there.
it
is
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
you
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
who
they
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
slot
machine
case
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
if
the
company
had
in
fact
not
gone
around
and
looked
at
the
machines
and
gotten
the
amount
of
liability
off
of
each
machine?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that
suggest
that
we
are
not
just
talking
about
the
estimate,
but
we
are
talking
about
the
first
prong?

antonin

justice
antonin
scalia
if
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
the
airplane
tickets
is
the
way
it
is,
why
did
the
insurance
companies
need
a
special
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
do
think
it
is
superfluous.
you
really
wouldn't
need
it...
you
wouldn't
need
any
special
provision
for
insurance
companies,
would
you,
if
we
agree
with
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
on
the
airline?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
the
amount,
but
you
are
estimating
the
existence
of
the
liability.
exactly.
not
just
the
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
very,
very
sure
estimate,
but
as
to
the
claims
that
haven't
been
filed
you
are
guessing
that
there
is
a
liability.
it
is
a
very,
very
good
guess,
probably,
you
know,
99.9999
percent
accurate,
but
it
is
still
an
estimation
about
the
existence
of
the
liability
as
opposed
to
an
estimation
of
the
amount
of
a
known
liability.
