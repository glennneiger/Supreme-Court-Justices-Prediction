mr.
horowitz,
that
quotation
might
be
read
to
refer
to
the
second
prong
of
the
all
events
test,
the
amount,
the
accuracy
of
the
estimate
of
the
amount,
and
as
i
understand
it
you
don't
challenge
that
point
of
the
decision
below.
is
that
correct?
you
think
it
is
wrong
but
you
didn't
raise
it
in
your
cert
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
is
it
correct
that
the
case
before
us
would
be
the
same
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
issue
we
have
to
decide?
if
you
had
a
small
business
with
only
one
employee
who
got
sick
and
you
knew
precisely
what
the
amount
of
the
medical
expense
was
but
he
just
hadn't
filed
the
claim
until
after
the
first
of
the
year.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
be
the
difference?
what
would
be
the
relevant
difference
insofar
as
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
they
took
the
amount
that
was
exactly
the
amount
that
the
employee
told
them
the
bill
was,
and
he
showed
them
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
doesn't
that
go
to
the
amount
question
rather
than
the
certainty
of
the
obligation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
position
applies
equally
to
undisputed
claims,
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
certainly
there
are
some
of
the
claims
that
are
undisputed,
and
i
am
just
trying
to
posit
a
hypothetical
with
the
claims
undisputed
as
to
liability,
undisputed
as
to
amount.
the
only
thing
that
was
not
done
is
the
further
processing.
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
would
be
the
same
in
that
case
insofar
as
you
are
talking
about
the
first
prong
of
the
all
events
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just...
would
your
argument
be
the
same
or
not
in
that
case?
and
if
not,
what
is
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
amount
is
undisputed,
the
fact
of
the
service
is
undisputed,
everything
is
undisputed
except
he
just
didn't
process
it,
didn't
perform
the
final
event
of
filing
a
written
application.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
be
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
perhaps
it
is
a
little
unfair
to
you,
but
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
about
filing
the
claim
has
a
certain
reminition
to
the
slot
machine
not
being
pulled
yet--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
i
found
persuasive
in
that
case,
as
you
may
recall.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
these
56,000
people,
there's
just
no
realistic
basis
for
assuming
there
is
some
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
pretty
strong
probabilities,
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
like
about
99
million
to
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
when...
the
first
year
they
operated
they
took
over
the
business
from
the
insurance
carriers,
did
they
pay
for
the
reserve
in
the
face
amount
of
the
reserve?
did
they
put
out
dollars
equivalent
to
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
did,
so
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
ms.
mcnown,
beyond
that
he
would
say
there
was
no
fact
of
liability.
you
miss
the
first
prong
if
nobody
got
on
the
airplane.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
your
case,
you
have
to
assume
that
in
fact
a
lot
of
people
traveled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
to
know
about
it,
but
at
least
they
have
to
travel.
you
don't
have
any
liability
to
nonexistent
travelers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
did
have
nonexistent
travelers
you
would
lose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
the
special
statute
enables
them
to
take
accrual
accounting
on
a
lot
of
reserves
that
would
not
meet
the
all
events
test,
such
as
your
accident
case
in
milwaukee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume
those
are--
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
real
point
as
i
understand
it
is,
you
don't
have
to
know.
the
question
is
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
liability
to
your
end.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
didn't
know
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
long
as
you
found
it
out
by
the
time
you
filled
out
your
tax
return.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
do.
what...
well--
