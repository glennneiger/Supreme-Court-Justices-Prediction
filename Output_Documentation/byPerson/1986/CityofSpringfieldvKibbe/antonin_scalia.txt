how
far
do
you
go
in
not
taking
necessary
steps
before
you
are
in
effect
permitting?
suppose
a
municipality
is
running
a
jail,
and
it
just
doesn't
take
any
steps
to
buy
food
for
the
jail,
so
that
the
prisoners
are
not
getting
any
food.
now
there's
no
written
policy
that
says,
it's
okay
not
to
feed
the
prisoners.
but
anybody
would
know
that
you
need
food
there.
would
that
be
a
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
the
municipality
knows
that
its
police
are
constantly
using
lethal
force?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
there
are
several
people
killed
every
month.
and
it's
notorious,
it's
well
known.
the
city
takes
no
steps
to
stop
it.
but
it
doesn't
have
a
memorandum
that
says,
good
work.
it
just
doesn't
take
any
step
whatever
to
stop
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
the
officers,
but
not
by
the
city.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
isn't
that
gross
negligence
you're
talking
about?
you're
saying
that
anybody
who
saw
that
and
took
no
step
to
stop
it
would
be
so
grossly
negligent
that
you
can
attribute
almost
willful
permission
from
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
goes
to
whether
the
negligence
is
gross
or
not.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
principle
of
whether
gross
negligence
alone
is
enough
to
establish
the
kind
of
intent
you
need.
you're
just
saying,
look,
if
nobody
has
been
dying
out
there,
the
city
is
not
necessarily
aware
of
the
problem.
but
once
that's
been
happening,
it's
very
much
aware,
and
it
becomes
gross
negligence.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you.
it
seems
to
me
that's
precisely
what
gross
negligence
is,
negligence
that
approaches
such
a
point
that
you
almost
have
to
intend
the
result
in
order
not
to
have
done
something
to
stop
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
i'm
not
sure
what
you
can
say
about
it
except
that
it
happened.
the
instruction
at
trial
specifically
said
that
the
jury
could
find
liability
if
the
city
had
failed
to
train,
supervise
or
discipline,
and
if
that
failure
is
reckless
or
grossly
negligent.
and
the
city
did
not
object
to
that.
in
fact,
the
city
itself
asked
for
an
instruction
which
included
the
statement
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
city
was
not
merely
negligent
in
its
training,
but
grossly
negligent
in
failing
to
train
its
police
officers.
and
now
you're
arguing
before
us,
although
you
asked
for
that
instruction,
that
that
is
not
enough.
now
why
should
we
hear
this
at
this
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
not
brought
up?
the
failure
to
object.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
petition
for
cert
said...
says
the
following,
among
other
things:
the
court
in
tuttle
expressed
doubts
as
to
whether
inadequate
training
can
ever
be
a
policy
or
custom
under
monell.
however,
a
trend
in
the
lower
courts
permits
municipal
liability
based
on
inadequate
training.
this
trend
undermines
the
standard
of
liability
established
by
monell
and
its
progeny.
without
further
definition
of
this
standard,
lower
courts
will
continue
blah-blah-blah-blah.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that,
when
you've
urged
a
negligence
theory?
you
have
negligence,
and
you
have
a
deprivation
of
life,
without
due
process
of
law,
i
presume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
anything
in
there
about
police.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
police
in.
what
you
may
be
able
to
read
in
is
the
necessity
of
intentionally
depriving
somebody
of
life.
that's
what
makes
it
a
constitutional
violation.
if
you
intentionally
do
it,
and
then
you
may
argue,
well,
it's
almost
the
same
as
intentionally
doing
it
to
do
it
with
gross
negligence.
because
there's
very
little
difference
between
that
and
intent.
and
there
you
have
a
theory
that
separates
constitutional
violations
from
ordinary
torts.
but
when
you
argue
before
us
that
only
a
negligence
standard
is
necessary,
i
don't
know
how
you
distinguish
the
negligent
construction
of
a
building
from
negligent
action
by
a
police
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pikula,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
goes
to
the
last
point
just
made?
your
first
question
presented
in
your
petition
does
read,
whether
inadequate
training
of
police
officers
is
a
viable
theory
of
municipal
liability
under
42
u.s.c.
1983.
does
the
petition
contend...
i
didn't
read
it
as
contending...
that
under
no
circumstances,
training
can
be
a
theory
of
municipal
liability?
in
other
words,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
text
lives
up
to
the
billing.
it
says,
whether
it
can
be
a
viable
theory.
but
does
your
petition
assert
that
you
were
going
to
argue
that
training
can
never,
under
no
circumstances,
be
a
theory
of
liability?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
i
don't
really
know
what
the
question
presented
means,
whether
it
is
a
viable
theory...
i
don't
like
"viable"
anyway.
i
don't
understand
what
it
means
here.
what
did
you
mean
by
it?
