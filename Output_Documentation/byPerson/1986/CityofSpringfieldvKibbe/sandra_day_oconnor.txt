mr.
pikula,
is
a
policy
unconstitutional
if
it
permits
but
does
not
explicitly
authorize
constitutional
violations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
my
question
was,
if
it
permits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
pikula,
if
the
city
policymakers
adopt
an
inadequate
policy
with
regard
to
a
specific
matter,
and
if
they
know
that
it
is
inadequate,
is
that
enough
for
the
determination
of
a
policy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
they
adopt
a
policy
for
police
training
which
is
in
fact
inadequate,
and
if
they
know
it
is
inadequate,
is
that
enough?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
by
definition,
if
it's
inadequate,
it's
going
to
permit
conduct
which
would
violate
the
constitution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
doesn't
it
go
to
fault
rather
than
to
the
existence
of
a
policy?
i
find
your
argument
difficult
to
follow.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
nagel,
haven't
a
good
many
lower
courts
applied
a
deliberate
indifference
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly,
there
are
a
good
many
cases
out
there
in
these
situations
that
have
applied
a
deliberate
indifference
standard.
and
doesn't
that
standard
come
a
lot
closer
to
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
davidson
and
cannon.
