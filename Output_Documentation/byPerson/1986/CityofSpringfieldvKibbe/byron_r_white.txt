justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
foreclose
review
on
the
basis
that
you
didn't
object.
they
just
reached
the
merits
are
moved
against
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
rule
on
it,
they
ruled
on
it
and
approved
it.
they
approved
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
decide?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
about...
didn't
they
say
that...
didn't
they
say
that...
talk
about
the
standard
for
determining
when
there
is
a
policy
about--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
do
you
say
then...
but
i
suppose
the
issue
is
fairly
here
with
respect
to
whether
the
evidence
shows
that
there
was
gross
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask,
do
you
believe
that
if
some
member
of
the
community
or
some
organization
interested
in
law
enforcement
thought
that
the
city
had
an
inadequate
training
program
or
one
that
evidenced
deliberate
indifference
or
gross
negligence
could
just
bring
a
suit
and
say...
a
1983
suit
and
say,
you've
got
a
bad
program,
and
we
want
an
injunction
for
you
to
measure
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
inadequacy
in
the
program
does
have
to
be
the
cause
of
some
injury?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
in
this
case,
certainly
one
of
the
issues
here,
even
if
you're
right
on
the
standard,
does
the
evidence...
does
the
case...
was
there
an
injury
that
demonstrated
gross
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
whatever
the
standard
was
that
was
approved.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
see,
there
is
an
issue
of
that
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
causation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wasn't
a
constitutional
violation
unless
there
was
a...
as
the
court
of
appeals
said...
a
grossly
negligent
training
program,
and
that
training
program
was
responsible
for
the
injury.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
right.
but
what
constitutional
violation
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
is
not...
well,
without
due
process
of
law.
i
thought
that
meant
that
there
had
to
be...
in
this
case,
that
it
had
to
be
a
grossly...
it
had
to
be
caused
by
a
grossly
negligent
training
program
before
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
say
then
it's
clear
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
you
do.
but
that's
one
of
the
issues.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
constitutional
violation
of
the
city,
necessarily.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
police
officer
is
merely
negligent.
that's
bad
conduct,
i
must
say,
especially
if
he
took
somebody's
life.
but
say
he's
merely
negligent.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
but
then,
what
if
it
is
proved
that
the
city
had
a
grossly
negligent
training
program,
and
that
this
officer
hadn't
been
properly
trained?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
was
the...
was
the
officer
here
negligent,
or
just...
grossly
negligent?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
knew
he
was
breaking
the
law
or
anything
else.
he
was
just...
he
made
a
mistake
of
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
he
was
doing
what
he
was
supposed
to
do?
