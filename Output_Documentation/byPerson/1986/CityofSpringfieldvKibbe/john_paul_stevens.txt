justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
the
first,
i'm
not
sure
i
completely
understand
your
view.
would
it,
in
your
view,
be
constitutionally
permissible
for
the
city
to
employ
totally
untrained
people
and
just
said,
we
need
a
hundred
law
enforcement
officers.
here
are
the
guns.
you
go
out
and
avoid
law
and
order...
you
know,
just
maintain
law
and
order.
and
just
did
nothing
else.
but
he
said,
this
is...
you
are
our
policemen.
we'll
pay
you
x
dollars.
period.
would
that
be
an
unconstitutional
policy,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
would
be...
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
they,
in
addition
to
that,
said,
everytime
you
see
anybody
running
away,
you
just
go
ahead
and
shoot
to
kill.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
would
be
bad.
they
have
to
give
an
affirmative
instruction
to
do
something
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
only
decision
was
not
to
fire
any
of
these
officers?
a,
not
to
fire
them;
and
b,
not
to
give
them
any
more
training?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they're
on
notice
that
they're
very
poorly
trained,
and
they're
very
hazardous
to
the
general
public.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
notice
takes
the
form
that
we
don't
think
you
have
an
adequate
training
program
for
your
police.
because
there
have
been
a
lot
of
mistakes
made.
and
then
they
still
don't
train.
would
that
failure
to
train
be
an
unconstitutional
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
phrase
the
question
just
a
little
different.
i'll
phrase
it
affirmatively.
supposing
city
fired
all
their
police
officers,
we
need
a
clean
sweep
of
our
police
force.
we
hire
a
brand
new
bunch
of
officers.
they
all
have
to
be
military
veterans.
they
all
have
to
be
trained
in
how
to
handle
weapons.
they
all
have
to
be
trained
in
the
martial
arts,
and
how
to
wear
uniforms
neatly,
and
how
to
march.
that's
all
they're
trained.
and
then
they
just
turn
them
loose
in
the
city.
don't
tell
them
how
to
serve
search
warrants,
how
to
arrest
people,
how
to
stop
vehicles,
or
anything.
they
just
train
them
to
the
extent
i
described.
and
then
there
are
a
lot
of
mistakes
made
thereafter.
would
there
be
a
constitutional
violation
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
was
the
instruction
on
proximate
cause,
not
the
instruction
justice
scalia
is
talking
about.
did
you
challenge
this
point
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
grossly...
did
you
make
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
gross
negligence
alone
would
not
suffice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
about
at
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
they
did
bring
it
out
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
though,
didn't
they?
they
did
point
out
the
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
cert,
they
raised
the
question
about
the
instructions
too,
didn't
they?
didn't
they
also
point
out
the
instruction
was
proper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
go
back
to
the
instruction
problem.
is
it
not
correct
that
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
you
did
not
challenge
any
instruction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
everybody
agrees,
don't
they,
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
caused
by
the
police
officer
acting
under
color
of
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
in
dispute,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
question
is
whether
the
city
itself
committed
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nagel,
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question
about
what
you
would
agree
is
before
us?
i
understand
it's
your
position,
is,
that
issues
relating
to
the
standard
of
care
and
the
instruction
are
definitely
not
here,
but
you
do
agree
that
the
first
question
presented
by
the
cert
petition,
whether
the
inadequate
training
is
a
viable
theory
of
municipal
liability,
that
that
is
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
short
answer,
you
do
not
accept
that
that's
necessarily
before
us?
