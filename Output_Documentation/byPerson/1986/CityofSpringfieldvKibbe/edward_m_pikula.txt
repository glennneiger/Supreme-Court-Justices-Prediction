mr.
edward
m.
pikula
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
standard
for
municipal
liability
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983.
the
facts
center
on
the
fatal
shooting
of
a
fugitive
who
had
abducted
a
woman,
who
had
avoided
police
at
two
roadblocks
during
a
chase
through
the
streets
of
the
city
of
springfield.
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
first
circuit's
opinion...
decision
should
be
reverse.
first,
there
is
no
unconstitutional
policy
in
this
case.
second,
gross
negligence
is
an
insufficient
standard
of
liability.
and
third,
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
the
jury
verdict
against
the
city.
with
regard
to
the
first
reason,
since
monell
interpreted
section
1983
to
impose
policy
based
municipal
liability,
an
unconstitutional
policy
has
been
prevalent
in
cases
where
this
court
has
approve
municipal
liability.
the
first
circuit
has
expanded
municipal
liability
beyond
the
limits
of
this
court's
decision
by
imposing
liability
without
the
requirement
of
an
unconstitutional
policy.
the
explicit
requirement
of
an
unconstitutional
policy
would
draw
a
line
which
determines
causation.
for
example,
when
a
municipal
employee
acts
pursuant
to
an
unconstitutional
policy,
a
constitutional
deprivation
results,
and
the
city
would
be
responsible
for
that
deprivation.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
i
believe
a
policy
is
unconstitutional
if
it
requires
the
conduct
which
causes
a
constitutional
violation,
or
permits
it.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
or
permits
the
conduct
which
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
i
believe
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation
of
the
constitution
was
at
issue.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
no,
the
jury
instruction
did
charge
on
a
violation
of
due
process,
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--well,
i
think
a
different
constitutional
amendment
would
be
in
issue
in
a
prison
case.
but
in
terms
of
whether
the
constitution
imposes
affirmative
obligations
upon
a
city,
i
don't
believe
that
it
does.
it's
our
position
that
the
constitution
is
a
charter
of
prohibitions,
which...
which
states
that
the
city
should
not
permit
its
officers,
or
instruct
them,
to
violate
the
constitution,
or
instruct
them
in
conduct.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
well,
i
believe
justice
scalia's
question
involved
an
eighth
amendment
case,
where
someone
who's
in
custody.
and
there
may
be
different
rights
at
issue.
now,
in
addition
to
drawing
a
line
which
indicates
causation,
an
unconstitutional
policy
requirement
would
provide
guidance
to
litigants
in
evaluating
liability;
would
prevent
liability
based
on
respondeat
superior;
and
would
prevent
liability
based
solely
on
the
perception
of
the
city
as
a
deep
pocket.
now,
with
regard
to
the
second
reason
for
reversal
in
this
case,
gross
negligence--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--i
don't
believe
so,
no.
it
would
certainly
be
a
violation
of
massachusetts
state
law.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
or
an
instruction
such
as
was
in
issue
in
tennessee
v.
garner,
where
that
policy
certainly
intended
that
deadly
force
be
used
against
a
nondangerous
felon,
even
though
they
didn't
go
out
and
say,
shoot
every
nondangerous
fleeing
felon,
that
conducted
was
permitted
by
the
statute
in
that
case.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
well,
that--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--in
that
situation,
we
certainly
have
some
sort
of
pattern
of
misconduct--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--no,
but
you
may
be
able
to
infer
some
sort
of
conscious
decision
by
policymakers
in
not
responding
to
that
prior
patter,
which
might
give
them
some
knowledge
that
there
was
something
wrong.
but,
for
instance,
in
a
case
like
this,
we
have
only
a
single
incident
where--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--well,
in
any
case,
before
anything
could
be
attributed
to
a
policymaker,
some
conscious
decision
on
the
part
of
a
policymaker
needs
to
be
shown.
without
that,
it
would
just
be
liability
based
on
respondeat
superior.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
again--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--if
there
is
some
notice
that
they
are
some
hazard
to
the
general
public--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--i
don't
believe
so.
if
there
was
a
prior
pattern
of
misconduct...
if
this
court
does
not
choose
to
impose
a
standard
of
requiring
an
unconstitutional
policy,
if
there's
a
prior
pattern
of
misconduct,
at
least
you
could
infer
some
knowledge
on
the
part
of
policymakers
in
that
they
had
an
opportunity
to
respond
and
prevent
some
future
action.
in
this
case,
we
have
simply
a
single
incident
which
occurred
very...
during
a
very
short
period
of
time;
it
did
not
provide
any
opportunity
for
policymakers
to
respond
or
prevent.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
well,
gross
negligence
is
an
insufficient
standard
for
liability,
because
it
does
not
involve
any
cognitive
element
which
is
necessary
to
show
any
state
of
mind
on
the
part
of
policymakers.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
the
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
has
historically
involved
deliberate
or
conscious
decisions
rather
than
a
lack
of
due
care.
a
lack
of
due
care
has
not
historically
been
the
type
of
conduct
which
is
implicated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
not
the
sort
of
abuse
of
government
conduct
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed
to
prevent.
on
the
other
hand,
decisions
which
are
conscious,
or
deliberate,
are
precisely
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
designed
to
prohibit.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
i
don't
believe
inadequate
training,
in
itself,
is
enough
for
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
only
if
that
training
policy
intends
conduct
which
violates
the
constitution,
or
permits
conduct
which
violates
the
constitution?
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
not
necessarily.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
i
believe
that
the
issue
of
fault
on
the
part
of
the
city
is
shown
when
you
show
that
policymakers
have
made
some
sort
of
conscious
decision,
or
acted
deliberately,
rather
than
inferring
that
they
have
done
something
without
any
evidence
to
show
policymakers
have
acted
at
all.
then
liability
is
based
solely--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--i
think
historically
failure
to
act
has
not
been
the
basis
of
constitutional
violations.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
again,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
state
law
in
massachusetts.
and
certainly,
there
may
be
a
duty
to
do
so
in
ordinary
tort
law.
but
to
distinguish
a
constitutional
violation
from
an
ordinary
tort--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--no,
certainly
not.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
that
certainly
would
be,
telling
somebody
they're
entitled
to
shoot.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
yes.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
no,
under
the
constitution,
as
i
said,
i
don't
believe
there
is
an
affirmative
duty
to
train.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
the
constitution...
or
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
in
this
case
or
in
any
other
case
which
shows
that
just
giving
someone
a
gun
is
more
likely
than
not...
likely
to
result
in
constitutional
violations.
it's
when
you
condone,
or
tolerate,
behavior
which
violates
the
constitution,
which
is--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--no.
it's
certainly...
if
one
shot
was
fired
pursuant
to
an
unconstitutional
policy,
that
would
be
sufficient
to
impose
liability.
on
the
other
hand,
if
all
we
have
is
one
shot
that's
fired,
it's
really
uncertain
whether
or
not
that
shot
was
fired
pursuant
to
any
policy
to
violate
the
constitution,
rather
than
just
the
conduct
of...
or
misconduct
of
an
employee.
and
i
believe
that
would
go
beyond...
or
cross
over
into
respondeat
superior
liability,
basing
liability
solely
on
misconduct.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
no,
certainly
not.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
well,
for
example,
in
tennessee
v.
garner,
if
a
city
adopted
a
policy
which
permitted
deadly
force
to
be
used
against
a
nondangerous
fleeing
felon,
that
would
violate
the
constitution
under
tennessee
v.
garner,
and
would
be
an
unconstitutional
policy,
although
not
unconstitutional
on
face.
the
fact
that
it
permitted
the
unconstitutional
conduct
would
be--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
i
certainly
wouldn't
ask
for
that
instruction
again.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
it
may
have
been
unartfully
drafted
on
my
part.
however,
i
believe
the
issue
is
preserved
with
regards
to
our
motion
for
directed
verdict,
and
our
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
that's
correct.
they...
that
was
not
brought
up
by
the
first
circuit
at
all.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
the
failure
to
object.
they
did
reach
a
jury
instruction
in
question...
a
jury
instruction
question,
and
did
discuss
it
in
their
opinion.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
they
approved
the
instruction,
although
they
noted,
it
could
have
certainly
been
more
detailed.
they
felt--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--as
i
said,
i
believe
our
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
did.
one
of
the
points
was
that
even
grossly
negligent
training
wouldn't
be
enough.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
at
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
not
specifically
laid
out
in
our
brief
that
way,
although
we
did
ask
for
some
higher
standard
of
culpability.
and
we
were
searching
for
a
standard.
and
as
i
said,
we
were
kind
of
unsure
what
the
standard
should
be.
and
then
i
think
this
decision
in...
the
court's
decision
in
tuttle
clarified
that.
now--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--none
whatsoever.
there
was
no
showing
that
the
city's
training
violated
any
recognized
standards.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
well,
again,
once
the
trial
judge
had
denied
my
motion
for
a
directed
verdict,
some
jury
instruction
did
have
to
be
put
forward,
and
therefore--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--one
i
wish
i
had
objected
to,
yes.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
that's
correct,
justice.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
i--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--the
first
point...
our
first
point...
our
first
point
in
our
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
was
that
there
was
no
proof
of
an
unconstitutional
policy.
our
second
point
had
to
do
with,
there's
no
evidence
of
negligent
training.
and
our
third
point
was,
there
was
no
evidence...
or
even
grossly
negligent
of
a
single
officer
would
be
insufficient.
something
of
that
nature.
i
believe
that's
specifically
what
it
was.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
no,
i
did
not.
but
i
should
point
out,
i
believe
last
term
in
tuttle,
the
same
argument
was
made
about
the
failure
to
object
to
jury
instructions.
and
the
court
noted,
it
was
not
brought
up
in
the
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert.
i
believe
the
same
issue
is
also--
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
not
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
cert,
but
in
the
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
well,
i
don't
believe
they
raised
the
51(a)
objection.
now,
there
are
three
reasons
why
this
jury
verdict
against
the
city
is
not
supported
by
sufficient
evidence.
as
i
noted,
this
case
involved
only
a
single
incident,
which
would
not
provide
any
opportunity
for
policymakers
to
respond
to
the
situation
or
have
any
knowledge
that
there
was
anything
wrong.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
we
challenged...
no,
that's
correct.
we
challenged
the
old
standard
for
inadequate
training.
additionally,
the
jury
verdict
is
not
supported
by
sufficient
evidence
because
it
does
not
involve...
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
conscious
decision
by
a
policymaker.
and
as
i
also
noticed,
the
jury's
verdict
is
not
supported
by
sufficient
evidence
in
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
city
violated
any
recognized
training
standards.
the
verdict
is
based
on
nothing
more
than
speculation.
and
if
the
decision
is
allowed
to
stand,
it
will
allow
the
imposition
of
municipal
liability
and
a
standard
of
proof
which
is,
in
essence,
respondeat
superior.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
just
one
point
i
would
like
to
make.
and
that
is,
the
first
circuit
found
that
respondent's
theory
that
the
springfield...
the
city
of
springfield
had
a
policy
to
permit
the
use
of
deadly
force
whenever
technically
permitted
by
the
rules
was
not
sufficiently
proven
or
sufficiently
linked
to
the
harm
to
impose
liability.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
no,
i
don't
think
we're
urging
the
court
to
adopt
that
broad
a
rule.
if
training
intends
or
permits
unconstitutional
acts,
then
that
would
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
edward
m.
pikula
basically,
whether
a
general
allegation
that
the
city
just
didn't
train
its
officers
well
enough
to
prevent
this
incident
is
a
basis
of
liability.
we
argue
that
it
is
not.
