you
don't
take
into
consideration
failure
to
act?
you
do
not
take
into
consideration
failure
to
act
on
the
part
of
the
city?
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
failure
to
instruct
the
police
on
the
proper
methods
of
protecting
people's
rights
is
not
required?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
for
a
city
to
hire
a
man,
give
him
a
gun,
tell
him
he's
entitled
to
kill
somebody
and
turn
him
loose,
that's--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
nothing
else,
that
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
nonaction.
you
agree
that
that's
bad.
you
have
to
tell
him
something,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
much
do
you
have
to
tell
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
xxx
tell
him,
don't
take
this
gun
that
i
give
you
and
unwillingly
kill
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
now
you're
going
to
use
the
dog
bite
rule.
one
shot's
okay,
but
don't
do
it
twice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
get
the
feeling
that
your
position
is,
the
only
way
the
city
can
be
liable
is
if
the
city
says,
specifically,
you
don't
need
to
follow
the
constitution;
do
what
you
please.
that's
the
only
way
the
city's
liable.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
else?
