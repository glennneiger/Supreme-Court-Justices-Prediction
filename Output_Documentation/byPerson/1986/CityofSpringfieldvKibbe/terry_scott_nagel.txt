mr.
terry
scott
nagel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
city
of
springfield
is
asking
the
court
to
reverse
a
modest
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
clinton
thurston
who
was
shot,
beaten,
and
then
denied
medical
care,
and
died
in
springfield.
the
scope
of
this
review
is
necessarily
somewhat
limited
narrowly
by
the
seventh
amendment
and
rule
51,
and
i'd
like
to
clarify
a
few
of
the
points
that
you
brought
up
in
the
questions
to
mr.
pikula
regarding
exactly
what
was
preserved
for
review
in
this
case.
regarding
gross
negligence
in
particular,
that
issue,
in
our
view,
is
completely
waived
in
this
case.
there
was
no
objection
to
the
instruction
regarding
gross
negligence.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
no,
your
honor,
that
would
have
been
impossible,
because
my
brother,
mr.
pikula,
didn't
put
it
in
his
petition
for
certiorari.
there's
not
a
mention
of
gross
negligence
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
on
page
15,
the
word
is
used
once
with
apparent
approval,
saying
that
we
failed
to
meet
the
burden
of
proof.
but
in
fact,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
city
litigated
on
the
theory
that
gross
negligence
was
a
proper
standard.
if
i
can
just
read
you
one
sentence
from
their
brief
from
the
court
of
appeals,
it
says:
to
sustain
an
action
under
section
1983
on
the
theory
of
negligent
training,
training
must
be
nonexistent,
or
reckless,
or
gross,
palpably
or
culpable
negligent
before
liability
will
attach.
it
says:
monell
has
been
interpreted
to
hold
that
a
municipal
policy
of
authorizing
or
condoning
police
misconduct
can
be
inferred
where
the
municipality
has
been
gross
negligent
in
the
supervision
or
training
of
its
police
force.
that's
reproduced
at
page
13
of
our
brief.
and
that's
from
their
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
yes.
they
didn't
object
to
the
instruction,
and
now
they're
arguing
that...
on
appeal,
on
a
motion
for
j.
n.
o.
v,
under
which,
of
course,
we're
entitled
to
have
the
evidence
construed
in
our
favor,
they
also
want
a
standard
which
they
argued
against...
which
the
requested
against
at
trial.
because
they
requested
a
gross
negligence
standard.
this
is
not
only
a
matter
of
wavering--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--about
that
issue?
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
they
agreed
with
the
gross
negligence
standard,
but
it
wasn't
litigated
in
the
first
circuit,
because
both
sides
agreed
at
the
first
circuit.
it
wasn't
before...
it
wasn't
anything
we
were
on
notice
of
until
we
received
the
city's
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
well,
certainly.
there
was
a
motion
for
j.n.o.v.--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--and
i
don't
quarrel
with
that.
what
i
quarrel
with
is
the
idea
that
this
case
is
presented
to
the
court
with
a
cert-worthy
case
in
which
the
review
the
standard
of
negligence
and
whether
training
can
ever
be
a
claim,
which
is
also
something
that
was
not
litigated
below.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
court
wishes
to
reach
that
question,
and
i'm
prepared
to
address
that
question.
but
i
want
you
to
be
aware
that
as
far
as
the
gross
negligence
question
in
particular,
there
was
nothing
below
to
indicate
that
this
was
going
to
be
an
issue
in
the
case,
and
nothing
to
put
us
on
notice
when
we
filed
our
opposition
to
cert.--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--it's
true.
and
as
far
as
inadequate
training,
i
think
we're
on
a
different
footing
than
the
gross
negligence
question.
because
just
the
question
presented
in
bold
face
type
on
their
petition
says,
can
failure
to
train
ever
be
a
claim?
and
we're
happy
to
talk
about
that.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
but
the
gross
negligence
question
simply,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
isn't
properly--
now,
there
are
two
issues,
and
i'd
like
to
clarify
also.
there
was
question,
i
believe,
from
justice
rehnquist
regarding
what
the
court
of
appeals
found.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
you
asked
that
question
on
the
basis
of
liability.
there
were
two
theories
of
liability
in
this
case.
this
is
not
the
tuttle
case.
there
were
two
theories.
one
was
that
there
was
an
explicit
unconstitutional
policy
of
the
city.
and
the
other
was
that
there
was
failure
to
train
amounting
to
gross
negligence.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
both
courts
below...
chief
judge
frank
freedman
of
the
massachusetts
district,
and
the
court
of
appeals...
found
that
there
was
evidence
sufficient
to
warrant
a
finding
that
it
was
a
policy
of
the
springfield
police
force
to
allow
the
use
of
deadly
force
at
the
first
moment
at
the
first
moment
at
which
it
was
technically...
appeared
technically
permissible
to
do
so
under
the
rules.
the
judge
made
a
memorandum
finding
with
regard
to
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
part
of--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--well,
there
was
evidence
at
trial
which
indicated
that
the
police
had
operated
under
a
rule
which
allowed
them
to
create
a
danger,
or
create
the
appearance
of
an
attack,
and
then
use
deadly
force.
the
shooting...
and
i
must
stress,
there
are
three
shootings,
and
two
beatings
in
this
case...
but
the
last
shooting
in
particular
in
this
case,
when
the
man
had
a
bullet
through
his
head
at
a
distance
closer
than
i
am
to--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--he
was
driving
down
the
street
in
his
car,
with
a
woman
in
the
seat--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--well,
it
depends.
we
are
here
on
a
motion
for
j.n.o.v.
and
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
from
which
you
could
have
found...
or
with
the
jury,
i
should
say,
because
that
is
who
we're
concerned
with...
the
jury
could
have
found
that
mr.
thurston
was
driving
along
at
a
legal
speed
straight
down
the
road,
and
the
motorcycle
came
up
next
to
him
and
shot
him
in
the
head
because
he
wouldn't
stop.
and
there's
a
police
rule
which
appears
on
its
face
to
allow
that,
a
rule
that
is
completely
at
odds
with
garner,
which
would
be
rule
2813,
which
says
that
when
you're
in
a
motor
vehicle
and
you
fire
a
gun,
you
can
shoot
a
dangerous
felon
fleeing,
or
a
felon;
you
can
shoot
a
nondangerous
fleeing
felon
on
the
face
of
this
rule.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
certainly
the
jury
could
have
found
that.
there
was
testimony
from
which
they
could
have
found,
he
never
swerved
his
car
at
the
motorcycle.
everyone
testified
he
was
driving
at
speeds
from
35,
25
to
45
miles
an
hour.
there
just--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--he
went
through
a
roadblock
that
was
set
up
over
a
crest
of
a
hill
where
he
had
two
seconds
when
he
came
over
the
hill.
and
as
he
came
over
the
hill,
there
was
a
policeman
standing
in
the
road
in
front
of
him
he
drew
his
gun
and
fired.
and
that
was
another
example
of
this
triggering
rule,
you
can
create
a
colorable
attack.
"i'll
stand
on
the
road
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
then
shoot.
"
and
he
drove
past
that
at...
i
think
he
approached
at,
they
said,
at
35
to
40
miles
an
hour.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
which
part,
you
mean
the
rule?
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
well,
actually
at
the
time
it
would
have
been
based
on
commonwealth
v.
klein,
which
tracks
garner
almost
exactly.
but
it
was
the
massachusetts
case
which,
i
believe,
the
instructions
to
the
jury
were
based
on.
which
track
the
elements
in
garner
precisely.
and
the
jury
heard
that
instruction.
they're
presumed
to
have
followed
it.
and
then
they
have
the
rule
book.
and
they
look
at
a
rule
that
says,
you
can
shoot
a
felon
or
a
dangerous
fleeing
felon.
they
could
have
concluded
that
there
was
a
de
jure
policy
that
was
unconstitutional.
and
besides
that,
there's
a
second
theory,
which
is,
of
course,
failure
to
train,
which
i
think
may
be
what
got
us
here
today.
and--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--yes.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
that's
true.
and
there
is
testimony
in
this
case
that
the
officers
were
not
trained
at
all
with
regard
to
shooting
at
fleeing
vehicles.
there's
testimony
directly
on
that
point,
which
takes
us
right
outside
of
tuttle.
i
mean,
tuttle...
the
only
thing
in
tuttle,
because
of
the
defective
instruction,
and
i
emphasize,
and
it's
reproduced
in
the
addendum
to
our
brief,
there
was
not
a
tuttle
instruction
in
this
case.
the...
if
i
again
can
read
you
just
one
sentence.
the...
judge
freedman
instruction:
an
incident
of
excessive
force
on
the
part
of
police
officers,
standing
by
itself,
is
insufficient
to
find
the
city
of
springfield
liable
under
section
1983.
now,
they're
presumed
to
have
heard
and
understood
and
followed
that
instruction.
so
they
had
all
of
the
things
that
went
on
on
this
day,
and
they
had
testimony
directly
on
point
from
a
number
of
police
officers
that
they
had
received
no
training:
no
training
with
regard
to
shooting
at
fleeing
vehicles;
no
training
with
regard
to
shooting
from
vehicles;
no
training
about
roadblocks
beyond,
stand
on
the
road
and
put
your
hand
up.
and
given
the
instruction,
which
is
sufficient
under
tuttle,
and
that
testimony...
that
is
what
we
were
litigating
in
the
first
circuit,
frankly.
we
went
up
to
the
first
circuit
on
a
tuttle
issue.
and
when
the
city
wrote
its
brief
in
the
first
circuit,
tuttle
was
still
pending
here.
it
came
down.
we
had
a
reply
brief,
which
also
didn't
talk
about
gross
negligence,
or
the
necessity
of
an
underlying
unconstitutional
policy,
or
some
of
the
other
issues
we're
talking
about
here
today.
but
we're
right
outside
of
tuttle
on
that
issue.
but
i
would
assume
the
court
wants
to
consider
the
training
question,
whether
training
can
ever
be
a
claim.
and
i
would
just
like
to
invite
your
attention,
the
fact
that
there's
really
no
reason
to
assume
that
there's
a
need
for
an
unconstitutional
underlying
policy.
there
were
a
lot
of
questions
about
that.
originally,
as
i
understood
this
case
to
be
formulating,
we
were
talking
about
whether
training
would
ever
be
a
claim.
but
if
the
inquiry
is
whether
the
underlying
training
policy
itself
has
to
be
unconstitutional,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
in
that
direction
lies
even
more
confusion
than
we
need
to
engage
in.
there's
been
a
problem
in
the
monell
area
that
the
temptation
really
is
to
develop
a
jurisprudence
that's
specific
to
police
cases.
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
do
that.
and
what
mr.
pikula
said
regarding
the
question...
i
believe
it
was
from
mr.
marshall,
from
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
justice
stevens
also
asked,
regarding
the
effect
of
no
training.
and
his
answer
was
to
the
effect
that
the
inquiry
seems
to
collapse
into
one
of
causation.
in
other
words,
if
there's
no
training
at
all,
and
it
causes
a
constitutional
violation,
then
why
do
we
need
to
bifurcate
the
inquiry
into
whether
the
policy
itself
is
unconstitutional
or
the
resulting
activity
of
the
police
is
unconstitutional,
when
the
statute
itself,
as
interpreted
by
monell,
says
that
if
a
causes
b
to
inflict
a
tort
on
c,
then
b's
tort
becomes
a's
tort.
i
mean,
that
language
is
right
in
monell,
and
it
comes
right
from
the
statute,
which
says
that
any
person
who
causes...
who
subjects
or
causes
to
be
subjected
to
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would.
i
think
that
a
better
traditional
category
of
tort
law
to
look
to
is
agency
law,
which--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--it
may
come
from
the
great
body
of
agency
law.
but
there's
no
reason
when
respondeat
superior
law
doesn't
apply
that
all
of
agency
law
has
to
be
thrown
out,
as
the
vincent
case
mentions.
and
if
you
take
that
part
of
the
restatement
of
agency...
or
general
agency
law
that
holds
that
a
principal
is
responsible
for
the
torts
that
occur
due
to
his
negligent
training,
supervision
or
selection
of
agents,
then
you're
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute
again
directly.
because
that
is
talking
about
causation.
that
is
something
the
principal
has
done.
and
that's
something
the
city
has
done
in
this
case.
its
negligent
training
of
their
agents.
and
i
just
mention
in
passing
that
one
of
the
things
that
was
alleged
in
the
complaint
four
years
ago
in
this
case
is
that
the
police
were
the
servants,
the
agents,
and
the
employees
of
the
city
of
springfield.
that
was
admitted
in
this
case.
there's
no
reason
to
treat
them
as
anything
else.
now
that,
unfortunately
that
part
of
the
answers
appears
to
have
been
omitted
from
the
joint
appendix.
but
i'm
sure
the
original
answer
is
here
on
file.
as
to
the
question
of
gross
negligence,
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
the
language
of
the
statute
and
monell,
i
would
also
just
invite
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
if
you
should
choose
to
reach
the
question
of
what
level
of
culpability,
what
the
mental
state
has
to
be
under
section
1983,
there's
no
reason
to
go
beyond
simple
negligence,
davidson
and
daniels
notwithstanding.
those
cases
weren't
dealing
with
municipal
liability.
those
were
dealing
with
the
simple
negligence
of
public
officials
or
government
officials
dealing
directly
with
the
person
injured.
but
the
language
of
section
6
is
worth
another
look.
that
is
the
language,
of
course,
which
in
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
monell
was
central,
it
was
the
lynchpin
to
the
argument
about
respondeat
superior.
and
footnote
57
of
that
case
says:
we
look
to
the
language
of
section
6
to
find
the
contours
of
municipal
liability.
well,
the
language
of
section
6--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--at
a
supervisory
level,
if
we're
understanding
that
word
to
mean
the
same
thing.
in
other
words,
if
the
chief
of
police
is
given
the
power
to
train...
has
delegated
the
power
to
train
all
the
police
officers,
and
he
gives
them
guns
and
says,
go
out
and
catch
bad
guys,
and
doesn't
give
them
any
other
instruction
than
that,
i
would
say
yes,
that
liability
would
attach
to
the
supervisory
official.
now,
there
would
be
inquiries
about
whether
he
was
asking
on
his
own,
or
whether
he
was
authorized
to
do
that
for
the
municipality.
but
there's
no
reason
to
go
beyond
that
level
of
negligence--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--under
1983?
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
well,
i--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--of
course
that
has
so
little
to
do
with
the
police
conduct
area,
where
you
know
you're
dealing
with
a
dangerous
instrumentality,
firearms,
so
forth,
that
you're
unleashing
on
the
populace,
and
that
if
the
people
aren't
trained,
the
constitutional
violations
are
not
only
foreseeable,
they're
almost
inevitable.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
is
there...
is
there
deprivation,
you
mean?
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
i
doubt
it.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
yes,
because
we
would
be--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--i
think
it's
because,
in
the
area
of
police
brutality,
which
is
a
central
governmental
function...
or
police...
the
police
are
a
central
governmental
function,
one
hopes...
you
have
a
different
standard
of--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--well,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
deprivation
under
color
of
state
law.
i
don't
think
that
the
supervisor
is
in
the
same
relationship
to
the
person
who
has
a
building
fall
on
them
as
a
police
officer
who
shoots
a
fleeing
felon.
it's--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--the
courts
have
been
inconsistent,
you're
right.
there
are
some
cases--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--well,
davidson
and
cannon,
as
i
understood
it,
was
ruling
out
simple
negligence
as
to
officials.
it's
true
that
leite
v.
city
of
providence
used
the
words,
gross
negligence
amounting
to
deliberate
indifference.
and
that
language
has
been
adopted
in
many
cases.
some
cases
don't,
though.
some
say,
gross
negligence.
some
say,
recklessness.
some
cases
have
avoided
the
question
altogether.
the
fact
is
that
every
circuit
that
has
considered
the
question
has
found
that
failure
to
train
is
a
basis
of
claim.
and
the
majority
of
them
have
found
gross
negligence
to
be
a
sufficient
basis.
but
to
get
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute
if
i
may
just
for
a
moment,
section
6
is...
of
the
statute,
which
is
now
42
u.s.c.
1986,
is
written
now
in
the
language
of
simple
negligence.
that's
the
statute
which
imposes
liability
on
anyone
having
power
to
prevent
constitutional
deprivations,
who
neglects
or
refuses
to
do
so.
and
the
measure
of
damages
there
is
the
damages
which
reasonable
diligence
could
have
prevented.
now
that
seems
to
be
the
language
of
simple
negligence.
if
the
court
is
going
to
impose
gross
negligence,
i
think
it
will
have
to
do
it
outside
that
part
of
the
statutory
history.
the...
there
is
also
statutory
history
in
the
congressional
globe,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
of
one
of
the
amicus
curiae,
regarding
the
fact
that
this
statute
will
impose
liability
for
the
defaults
of
the
municipality.
again,
language
of
simple
negligence.
so
there's
really
no
reason
to
go
beyond
a
gross
negligence
standard.
finally,
i
would
just
like
to
come
back
again
to
the
tuttle
issue,
or
the
tuttle
nonissue
in
this
case.
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
tuttle
seemed
to
be
that
the
single
incident
of
outrageous
brutality
on
the
part
of
the
police
officers
was
not
a
logical
basis
on
which
an
inference
of
failure
to
train
could
be
drawn,
that
single
thing...
that
single
shooting,
because
you
could
just
as
easily
infer
that
the
man
who
did
the
shooting
was
deranged.
"one
bad
apple",
was
the
phrase.
in
this
case,
you
have
three
shootings
in
three
separate
places,
the
third
one
being
presumably
the
fatal
bullet,
followed
by
a
beating
inside
the
man's
car,
which
was
justified
again
on
the
basis
that
he
had
failed
to
surrender.
he
was
unconscious
and
therefore
he
had
failed
to
surrender,
and
there's
an
officer
who
testifies
to
that.
another
beating
when
he
was
pulled
from
the
car.
and
then
man
is
transported
to
the
hospital.
and
whoever
fired
the
fatal
shot
withholds
the
information
that
the
man
has
been
shot.
and
we
know
that
theodore
perry
has
shot
him
from
eight
feet
away...
and
ballistics
shows
that
it's
his
bullet...
couldn't
have
not
known
that.
the
inference
that
arises
from
that
kind
of
a
broad
sampling
is
different,
by
far,
than
one
bad
apple
kind
of
analysis.
we're
talking
about
a
whole
collection
of
people
who've
engaged
in
this
conduct.
and
on
top
of
that,
we
have
testimony
that
these
men
have
not
been
trained.
now,
there
were
some
questions
about,
whether
no
training
at
all
can
be
a
basis
for
liability.
obviously,
the
unleashing
of
the
police
officers
on
the
city,
having
them
be
armed,
with
no
training
at
all,
and
with
rules
that
tell
them
they
can
shoot
nondangerous
fleeing
felons,
is
foreseeably
going
to
cause
this
kind
of
harm.
and
for
that
reason,
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict,
should
remain
denied.
we
should
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court...
the
trial
court.
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
reversing
it.
i
feel
that
at
this
point
i've
covered
almost
everything
that
the
city
has
talked
about--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--you
mean
without
the
occurrence
of
harm?
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
no,
not
under
section
1983.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
by
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
i
mean,
the
statute
gives
a
cause
of
action
if
someone
causes
a
constitutional
deprivation.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
well,
you
know--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--the
officer
who
filed
the
shot--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--well,
yes,
there's
no
issue,
or
no
question--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--that
constitutional
deprivation
occurred.
officer
perry...
there
was
a
judgment
of
$1
against
the
man
who
pulled
the
trigger
in
this
case,
and
$500
for
punitive
damages.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
your
question,
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
violation
occurred
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
was
caused
by
the
city?
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
there
was
a
deprivation
of
life
without
due
process
of
law,
a
summary
execution.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
in
the
case
that
is
here
on
appeal,
that
is
true.
i
don't
think
you
can
separate--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--by
the
city?
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
well,
i
think
it's
clear
on
the
evidence.
because
there's
testimony
that
these
guys
were
not
trained.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
yes.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
that's
correct.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
and
i
don't
think
anybody
would
argue
that
it
was
negligent.
he
testified
that
he--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--right.
and
that
is
a
causation
inquiry.
and
that--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--well,
not
merely
by
the
fact
that
the
officer
committed
one.
that
would
be
repsondeat
superior.
and
we're
not
arguing
for
that.
there
may
be
good
reasons
why
you'd
want
to
consider
that.
but
that
wasn't
how
we
litigated
this
case
below,
and
it's
not
how
we're
litigating
it
here.
but
the
jury
looked
at
all
of
this
evidence.
the
jury
are
the
people
under
the
seventh
amendment,
and
under
the
rules
of
construction
that
have
always
applied
in
the
review
of
the
motion
j.
n.
o.
v,
which
i
submit
is
all
that's
really
here.
they
thought
there
was
plenty
of
evidence.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
noting
that
defendant...
or
rather,
the
plaintiff
in
a
police
brutality
case
is
always
going
to
be
in
a
position
that
he's
going
to
be
accused
of
being
this
kind
of
felon,
or
being
that
kind
of
felon.
of
having
done
various
dangerous
things,
and
as
trial
counsel
said,
of
having
garbage
heaped
upon
his
grave.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
nonetheless,
if
they
find
someone
who's
that
unsympathetic
a
plaintiff,
and
they
find
for
him,
and
they
find
the
defendants
liable,
we
do
not
lightly
contemplate
reversal.
now
this
is
a
springfield
jury
that
drives
down
the
springfield
streets
and
pays
the
taxes
that's
going
to
pay
the
springfield
judgment.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
under
daniels
and
davidson,
there'd
be
no
claim
against
the
police
officer.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
and
that
that
training
amounted
to
gross
negligence
and
caused
his
negligence?
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
i
think
now...
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
can
of
worms
that
we're
opening
up
if
we
try
to
have
special
rules
of
culpability
for
each
defendant
in
a
1983
case.
why
not
just
use
the
ordinary--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--he
said
he
meant
to
do
it.
this
is
intentional.
there's
no
question
about
that.
he
said,
i
dropped
back.
i
said,
i'm
going
to
pull
up.
if
he
swerves
again,
i'm
going
to
shoot
him.
not
exactly
in
those
words,
but
that's--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--well,
he'd
also
been
trained
that
he
was
able
to
do
this.
and
that
was
what
the
rules
allowed
him
to
do.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
question
that
he
was
acting...
and
again,
in
the
answer
to
the
complaint,
the
city
said
at
all
times--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--right.
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
i'm
not
sure
about
that
one,
to
be
frank
with
you.
we
have
not...
we
did
not
raise
rule
51
in
our
opposition
to
cert
on
that
question;
but
did
not
realize
that
we
were
going
to
be
arguing
about
something
that
the
city
had
asked
for
an
instruction
about,
and,
beyond
the
rule
51
question,
there
is
the
issue
of
invited
error,
because
this
was
also
an
instruction
that
they
asked
for.
it's
a
standard
they
incorporated
in
their
motion
for
j.
n.
o.
v
and
their
motion
for
a
directed
verdict.
in
the
middle
of
trial,
they
filed
a
motion--
mr.
terry
scott
nagel
--not
necessarily,
no.
thank
you.
