chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
the
city
of
springfield
versus
lois
thurston
kibbe.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
pikula.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
pikula...
excuse
me...
say
what
the
unconstitutional
conduct,
what
the
constitutional
violation
was?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what...
more
specific.
i
mean,
the
fourteenth
amendment...
again,
i'm
not
asking
you
for
your
opinion.
did
the
court
of
appeals
get
any
more
specific
than
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
we
had
something
to
say
about
that
situation
in
the
opinion
in
the
tuttle
case,
did
we
not,
that
where
the
respondent
fails
at
the
certiorari
stage
to
bring
out
the
reasons
why
the
court
might
not
be
able
to
reach
a
point
made
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
that
unless
it's
a
jurisdictional
point,
the
court
will
consider
it
waived?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pikula.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
nagel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
nagel,
in
your
opposition
to
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
orange,
did
you
bring
to
our
attention
the
reasons
that
you
now
adduce
for
not
reaching
the
points?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
what
you're
saying
is
not
that
we
can't
reach
the
points
that
they
raised
in
their
petition
for
certiorari,
which
we
granted,
or
anything
fairly
subsumed
under
it,
but
that
the
instruction
point
that
they're
making
is
outside
the
scope
of
even
those
points?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
unconstitutional
policy
in
this
hypothesis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
view
below,
what
was
it
that
was
unconstitutional
about
that
policy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
he
doing
at
that
point?
what
was
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
there
were
a
few
more
facts
attending
it
than
that,
weren't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
claim
is
that
your
client,
or
your
client's
predecessor,
was
not
a...
was
a
nondangerous
fleeing
felon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
also
went
through
a
roadblock,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
you
say,
that
part
of
your
hypothesis,
the
unconstitutional
conduct
is
based
on
our
decision
in
tennessee
v.
garner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the...
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
failure
to
train
doesn't
deal
with
whether
or
not
there
was
a
1980...
there
was
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
that's
your
monell
aspect
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
you
could
have
a
failure
to
train,
and
if
no
constitutional
right
was
violated
as
a
result
of
that
failure
to
train,
it
doesn't
make
a
bit
of
difference.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
that
allow
the
finding
of
liability
just
on
the
basis
of
respondeat
superior,
so
far
as
the
city
is
concerned?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
where
the
idea
of
respondeat
superior
comes
from,
i
thought,
is
agency
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
xxx
someone
is
hurt
by...
as
a
result
of
negligence
by
a
city
official
at
a
supervisory
level,
there's
a
claim
for
constitutional
violation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
negligent
construction
of
a
building,
of
a
city
building,
under
the
supervision--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
under
the
supervision
of
a
city
manager?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
a
piece
of
the
building
falls
off
and
kills
somebody,
depriving
him
of
life.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
constitutional
violation
in
justice
scalia's
hypothesis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
any...
i
mean,
is
there
any
constitutional
violation
if
the
city
building
in
structure
has
negligently
supervised
the
construction
of
a
building,
and
the
building
collapses
on
somebody?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
hope
you
would
doubt
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nagel.
mr.
pikula,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
eight
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pikula.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
judgment
of
the
court
to
announce
in
the
no.

stated
in
