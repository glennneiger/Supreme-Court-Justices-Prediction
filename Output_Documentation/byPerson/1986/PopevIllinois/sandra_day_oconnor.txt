justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
stanko,
may
i
inquire
whether
the
petitioner
offered
any
evidence
that
the
materials
here
had
redeeming
social
value?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
how
would
the
petitioner
be
prejudiced
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
lost
on
that
issue,
and
the
petitioner
was
tried
and
convicted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
didn't
even
make
an
offer
of
proof?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
standard
would
the
appellate
court
have
to
apply
on
appellate
review
of
this
third
part
of
the
miller
test?
would
it
have
to
review
what
the
illinois
community
standard
is,
i
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
would
you
clarify
for
me,
did
the
court,
the
trial
court,
give
the
defendants
instruction
number
two,
which
asks
that
they
apply
statewide
standards
to
all
aspects?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
how
did...
how
did
the
petitioners
preserve,
in
your
view,
the
argument
that
some
other
standard
should
apply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
do
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
stanko,
defendants'
instruction
was
the
one
that
was
given,
was
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
pope,
as
i
understand
it,
defendant's
instruction
was
requested
and
given,
and
it
specified
application
of
statewide
community
standards?
