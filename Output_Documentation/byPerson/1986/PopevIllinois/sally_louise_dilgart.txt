ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
supplement
petitioners'
summary
of
evidence
in
this
case,
because
this
record
reveals
that
petitioners
were
pandering
sexually
exclusive
material
of
the
hard-core
variety
solely
for
its
prurient
appeal
and
commercial
gain.
these
six
magazines
were
purchased
from
two
adult
bookstores
in
rockford,
illinois,
that
advertised
magazines
and
marital
aids
for
sale,
and
video
films
to
watch
inside
the
stores.
access
to
those
stores
was
limited
to
adults
only,
and
there
hundreds
of
magazines
just
like
these
for
sale
inside
those
stores.
everyone
of
the
magazines
was
sexually
explicit,
and
the
proprietors
had
even
grouped
the
magazines
in
categories,
categories
that
advertised
the
prurient
appeal
of
the
particular
subject
matter
involved.
the
titles
alone
of
these
magazines
revealed
that
their
extensive...
their
exclusive
purpose
is
to
appeal
to
prurient
interest.
each
one
of
the
magazines
which
you
have
before
you
today
contains
an
uninterrupted
series
of
photographs
depicting
the
same
kind
of
offensive
hard-core
sexual
conduct
described
by
this
court
in
miller
and
defined
by
illinois
law.
not
one
of
those
magazines
contains
any
stories
or
any
attempts
at
literature.
there
are
only
extended
captions,
captions
that
reiterate
in
graphic
terms
the
explicit
nature
of
the
photographs
themselves.
so
i
submit
to
you,
then,
in
this
context,
that
there
is
no
evidence
within
this
record
upon
which
any
jury
could
find
some
type
of
value.
petitioners
pandered
materials
portraying
hard-core
sexual
conduct.
the
authors
of
these
magazines
do
not
even
try
to
convey
ideas
or
artistic
messages.
so
i
submit
to
you
that
a
jury
applying
any
value
standard,
under
either
of
the
parties'
tests,
would
necessarily
find
these
magazines
to
be
obscene.
at
issue
before
this
court
today
is--
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
--it's
been
my
understanding
of
the
court's
decisions
in
the
past,
your
honor,
under
appellate
review,
that
the
court
will
undertake
that
duty,
and
has
a
constitutional
obligation
to
conduct
a
review
to
make
sure
that
the
first
amendment
has
not
been
violated
in
this
case.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
i'm
sorry,
i
couldn't
hear
the
first
part.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
no,
it's
my
understanding
that
all
the
magazines
as
people's
exhibits,
and
are
within
the
record
in
that
matter.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
today
this
court
is
asked
to
decide
whether
value
determinations
should
be
made
with
reference
to
ordinary
adults
within
the
community.
we
wish
to
make
two
arguments.
first,
that
such
an
instruction
does
indeed
serve
the
first
amendment.
and
secondly,
even
if
value
determinations
may
not
be
made
in
this
manner,
the
petitioners'
convictions
must
nevertheless
be
affirmed
because
they
were
not
materially
prejudiced
by
the
instructions
at
their
trials.
after
memoirs
and
miller,
jurors
are
required
in
the
first
instance
to
sit
as
fact-finders
to
determine
if
the
material
appeals
to
prurient
interest,
depicts
sexual
conduct
in
a
patently
offensive
way,
or
whether
the
material
has
value.
this
court
has
indicated
that
those
three
elements
coalesce
in
a
community
definition
of
obscenity.
so
in
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury
for
its
initial
determination,
then,
there's
no
reason
to
treat
value
determinations
in
any
other
way.
jurors
need
a
consistent
frame
of
reference
when
making
these
three
determinations.
in
these
particular
cases,
the
pope
and
morrison
juries
were
instructed
to
discard
their
personal
opinions,
to
consider
the
views
of
ordinary
adults
within
the
whole
state
of
illinois.
we
submit
to
you
that
that
instruction
was
constitutionally
proper.
jury
determinations
of
value
should
be
made
with
reference
to
community
standards.
and
i
use
the
term
"community"
in
the
sense
that,
by
definition,
it
will
look
beyond
the
idiosyncratic
opinion
of
a
single
person
to
focus
on
common
views
held
by
a
larger
group
of
people.
juries
were
designed
to
bring
a
sense
of
community
to
the
law,
and
jurors
perform
their
intended
function
when
they
make
judgments
of
this
very
sort.
contrary
to
petitioners'
claim,
community
standards
are,
in
a
sense,
objective,
because
they
prevent
jurors
from
indulging
their
personal
opinions
or
tastes.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
first
amendment
requires
any
particular
geographic
designation
of
the
community,
because
i
submit
to
you
that
decisions
of
those
nature
are
best
left
to
the
states.
allow
the
states
to
decide
the
geographical
designations
in
a
manner
consistent
with
our
traditions
of
local
government,
in
matters
of
public
welfare.
yet
the
contrary...
the
inference
here
is
that
if
a
state
wishes
to
adopt
a
statewide
standard,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
to
facilitate
the
juries'
decision-making,
then
that
state
may
constitutionally
do
so.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
i
would
submit
three
things
to
you,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
that
that's
not
the
situation
in
our
case.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
because,
again,
there
was
no
intent
to
convey
ideas.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
secondly,
i
would
submit
that
there
is
not
a
significant
notice
problem
of
a
nature
that
you
suggest,
because
under
the
standard
that
we
advocate
today,
people
can...
authors
and
distributors
can
reasonably
know
the
contours
of
that
community
definition.
in
this
case,
in
fact,
petitioners
introduced
evidence
of
the
statewide
standard.
petitioners
here
knew
the
contours
of
the
community
standard.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
the
problem
that
we
would
have
is,
under
the
alternative
approach
advocated
by
petitioners,
they'd
have
no
indication
whatsoever,
because
we
would
not
even
know
what
the
standard
was.
if
there
is
to
be
an
objective
standard,
such
as
that
advocated
by
petitioners,
some
sort
of
abstract
definition,
a
per
se
value
test,
then
i
submit
to
you
that
the
notice
and
chilling
problems
would
be
significantly...
significantly
greater
there.
the
best
approach
that
we
can
present
to
the
court
in
this
case
today
is
an
approach
in
which
people
may
sit
as
ordinary
adults
within
a
particular
community,
a
community
from
which
they
are
drawn,
where
they
will
reasonably
be
expected
to
know
the
views
of
that
community.
it
is
a
better
approach
than
an
objective
per
se
standard
or
a
national
standard,
which
as
i
understand
it,
are
the
options
in
this
case.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
we
do
not
agree,
your
honor.
we
would...
we
would
submit
to
you
that
any
evidence
which
is
relevant
to
the
value
of
the
material
is
admissible
as
relevant
to
the
material's
value.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
it
would
be
admissible
as
any
other
sort
of
expert
testimony.
the
new
york
times
critic
in
that
case
could
not
usurp
the
jury's
function
and
make
the
ultimate
determination;
but
the
juries
could
consider
that.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
to
the
extent
that
a
defendant
would
seek
to
introduce
evidence
pertaining
to
a
community
reaction
outside
the
state
standard
employed,
no,
it
would
not
be
admissible
in
that
context.
where
is
here,
then,
the
hamling
approach?
the
subjective,
idiosyncratic
approach
has
been
rejected.
and
jurors
will
look
beyond
personal
opinions
to
consider
the
views
of
ordinary
adults
within
a
community.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
demands
of
the
first
amendment
have
been
satisfied.
to
the
extent
the
petitioners
decry
the
possibility
of
parochial
determinations
of
value
in
this
standard,
i
submit
the
petitioners'
fears
are
not
well
founded.
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
a
national
standard.
it
does
not
require
homogenous
expression.
this
court,
in
the
hamling
decision
for
example,
has
indicated
that
different
judicial
districts
may
have
different
community
determinations,
just
as
different
states
may
regulate
in
different
ways
or
not
at
all.
and
as
a
logical
conclusion,
i
feel
that
different
states
may
reach
different
conclusions
concerning,
say,
the
artistic
value
of
a
work.
the
proper
check
against
unconstitutional
results
has
already
been
provided
by
the
existing
safeguard
of
appellate
review.
under
the
broad
scope
of
appellate
review
for
first
amendment
cases
described
in
bose,
this
court,
regardless
of
the
community
standard
employed,
may
exercise
its
independent
judgment
to
review
any
of
the
three--
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
--i
must
be
candid
and
say
that
the
court
has
not
spoken
with
utter
clarity
in
the
past,
because
this
issue
has
never
been
before
the
court.
as
i
read
miller,
miller
approved
and
required
the
use
of
community
determinations,
community
standards,
for
the
first
two
prongs.
and
about
two
paragraphs
later,
the
court
noted
that
of
course
it
would
have
independent
appellate
review,
of
the
new
york
times
nature,
available
to
it.
that
suggests
to
me
two
possibilities.
either
community
determinations
can
be
reviewed,
and
that
the
courts
will
not
have
difficulty
in
doing
so.
or,
that
the
courts
are
not
necessarily
restricted
to
assessing
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
underlying
the
community
standard
employed.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
i
read
jenkins
a
little
bit
differently,
your
honor,
because
jenkins,
as
i
understand
it,
looked
to
see
whether
or
not
the
described
types
of
hard-core
sexual
conduct
were
present
within
the
movie,
carnal
knowledge.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
under
the
second
prong
of
patently
offensive
sexual
conduct,
yes.
i
read
the
case
more
narrowly.
respondent
believes
that
petitioners
proposed
instructions
for
value
determinations
will
not
assist
a
jury.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
petitioners'
proposals
might
actually
encourage
unconstitutional
results.
to
the
extent
that
petitioners
would
exercise
any
reference
to
ordinary
adults
within
a
community,
petitioners,
we
feel,
would
remove
that
portion
of
the
instruction
that
jurors
will
not
indulge
their
personal
or
intolerant
views.
and
i
would
like
to
address
some
of
the
court's
questions
in
the
opening
part
of
the
argument,
and
discuss
the
three
possibilities
for
petitioners'
standards
here
as
i
see
them.
first
of
all,
i
find
reference
within
petitioners'
briefs
to
some
sort
of
objective
standard.
it
is
my
belief
that
if
petitioners
are
asking
this
court
to
enumerate
all
possible
criteria
for
value
in
the
abstract,
in
order
to
formulate
some
sort
of
other
objective
test,
then
we
would
oppose
any
shorthand
per
se
value
test.
these
simply
are
not
susceptible
to
definition.
there
is
no
merck
manual
for
obscenity.
there's
no
field
guide
to
literature.
nor
should
any
per
se
test
be
adopted
in
advance
of
the
material's
distribution,
for
that
material
may
be
pandered.
these
matters,
we
believe,
are
best
left
to
the
initial
determination
of
a
jury
drawing
on
their
own
knowledge,
considering
any
expert
testimony
which
may
have
been
admitted
at
trial,
and
with
the
safeguards
of
the
miller
case
and
appellate
review.
the
second
possibility
for
petitioners'
standards
concerns
a
national
standard.
because
they
repeatedly
fear
in
their
brief
the
possibility
of
parochial
determinations,
they
also,
at
least
to
my
mind,
seem
to
favor
a
national
community
standard.
we
find
three
flaws
with
that
approach.
first,
parochial
determinations
are
not
per
se
unconstitutional.
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
a
national
standard.
secondly,
we
doubt
that
that
sort
of
standard
could
ever
be
defined.
i
do
not
know
how
anyone
in
illinois
can
divine
the...
at
least
of
artistic
value
or
literary
merit
for
las
vegas
and
new
york.
and
finally,
i
think
it's
been
suggested
earlier
by
the
court,
that
a
national
standard
could
actually
work
to
petitioners'
disadvantage,
in
the
event
that
distribution
of
some
magazines
was
ultimately
discouraged
in
some
portions
of
the
country.
the
third
and
final
standard
that's
suggested
by
petitioners,
and
amici
especially,
would
place
value
determinations
in
the
hands
of
experts,
upon
the
dubious
assumption
that
jurors
cannot
be
trusted
to
determine
value
within
a
work.
we
suggest...
we
reject,
rather,
any
suggestion
that
obscenity
determinations
be
made
by
blue
ribbon
panels
of
experts.
jurors
have
been
deciding
questions
of
obscenity
xxx
all
along.
the
courts
have
always
assumed
that
laymen
can
recognize
value.
jurors,
we
believe,
can
be
trusted
to
recognize
bona
fide
expressions
of
ideas,
even
if
they
don't
personally
approve
of
those
ideas,
or
even
if
those
works
don't
suit
their
particular
taste.
ultimately,
any
of
petitioners'
standards
will
mandate
the
use
of
expert
testimony
in
obscenity
prosecutions,
because
all
of
petitioners'
standards
presuppose
some
body
of
knowledge
beyond
the
ken
of
the
average
juror.
we
reject
both
that
assumption
and
the
conclusion
requiring
expert
testimony
in
these
cases.
in
contrast,
we
believe
that
jurors
sitting
as
ordinary
adults
are
entitled
to
determine
which
magazines
have
value
to
them.
a
community
standard,
with
an
appropriate
scope
of
appellate
review,
will
best
serve
that
goal.
we'd
like
to
talk
for
a
moment,
too,
if
we
may,
about
some
of
the
safeguards
that
are
inherent
within
the
system.
petitioners,
i
feel--
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
--it's
my
understanding
that
that
line
of
cases...
there's
been
conflicting
opinions
within
the
court
in
the
past
on
that
topic,
i
know.
but
it's
been
my
understanding
that
in
a
recent
decision,
new
york
v.
ferber,
i
believe,
that
this
court,
referring
to
the
broderick
v.
oklahoma
substantial
overbreadth
analysis,
indicated
that
that
would
not
be
necessary
because
of
the
values
to
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
that
these
standing
rules
would
be
relaxed
because
of
the
values
permitted
by
the
first
amendment.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
uh-huh.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
two
analyses
are
conceptually
distinct.
because
i
understand
the
standing
concept
in
the
overbreadth
analysis,
whereas
in
this
case,
petitioners'
convictions
could
not
be
reversed
because
they
can't
demonstrate
material
prejudice
for
the
instructions
they
received
at
trial.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
yes,
your
honor,
the
defendants...
two
parts
here.
the
defendants
tendered
instructions
which
applied
statewide
standards
to
all
three
prongs.
also--
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
--it
would
be
my...
petitioners...
it's
a
more
complicated
situation,
inasmuch
as
petitioners
did
not
even
tender
instructions
which
would
define
a
national
or
an
objective
standard.
and
i
would
submit
that
to
the
extent
that
this
court
finds
those
factors
to
be
relevant,
it
should
do
so.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
that
this
court
is
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
the
state
of
this
record
in
deciding
whether
to
affirm
or
reverse.
i
think
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
devote
some
more
remarks
to
the
material
prejudice
issue
and
see
if
i
can
tie
some
of
these
things
together.
even
if
community
determinations
not...
community
standards
were
not
applied
to
value
determinations,
these
convictions
should
be
affirmed
because
petitioners
were
not
materially
prejudiced
by
the
instructions
used
at
trial.
the
authors
of
these
six
magazines
did
not
try
to
convey
ideas
or
artistic
messages.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
magazines
were
found
to
be
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
under
the
more
rigorous
memoirs
test.
petitioners'
jurors
in
these
cases
were
drawn
from
a
reasonably
diversified
and
cosmopolitan
state,
and
they
applied
an
ordinary
adult
person
standard
to
persons
within
that
state.
these
jurors
were
required
to
reject
their
personal
views.
petitioners
did
not
introduce
any
evidence
of
a
national
or
objective
standard,
nor
did
they
tender
instructions
which
define
those
terms.
petitioners
on
this
record
cannot
demonstrate
material
prejudice--
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
--well,
of
course
we
would
not
agree
that
it's
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
well,
we
would
also
argue
that
the
statute
was
not
unconstitutionally
applied
to
them.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
i
would
not
agree
that
the
instruction
was
unconstitutional.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
well,
i
would
argue
that
even
if
the
jurors
were
improperly
instructed,
the
court
must
affirm
because
there's
no
evidence
that--
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
--it
was
not
unconstitutionally
applied
to
them.
petitioner
cannot
demonstrate
material
prejudice
because
they
can't
show
that
juries
using
any
other
standard
would
have
reached
a
different
conclusion
in
these
cases.
i
would
like
then
to
turn...
devote
some
of
my
remarks
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
at
this
time.
petitioners
are
contending
that
the
illinois
obscenity
statute
was
unconstitutionally
applied
to
them.
they
must
necessarily
claim,
then,
that
these
six
magazines
had
some
value
to
be
discerned
by
a
jury
applying
a
noncommunity
standard,
because
the
authors
of
these
magazines
didn't
even
try
to
convey
ideas
or
artistic
messages.
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
value
finding
under
any
of
the
parties'
standards.
these
magazines
are,
indeed,
obscene.
we
also
dispute
the
argument
that
the
illinois
statute
is
facially
invalid
or
overbroad.
the
number
of
impermissible
approaches
always
involves
a
prediction,
at
best.
but
with
this
record,
a
record
containing
no
evidence
of
an
objective
or
national
standard,
and
no
evidence
that
the
illinois
standard
differed
from
petitioners'
standards
in
anyway,
with
this
record
the
number
of
impermissible
applications
would
be
unfounded
speculation
at
best.
absent
a
real
indication
of
substantial
overbreadth,
then,
the
illinois
statute
should
be
permitted
to
stand.
i
think,
perhaps,
that
petitioners
have
misstated
something
in
the
opening
portion
of
their
argument.
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
illinois
statute...
neither
the
illinois
statute
nor
the
illinois
courts,
through
any
authoritative
construction,
have
ever
required
the
application
of
any
community
standard
to
value
determinations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
illinois
appellate
court
in
these
cases
merely
refused
to
reverse
on
the
facts
of
these
cases.
they
did
not
mandate
the
use
of
community
standards
for
value
determinations
in
the
future.
there
is
no
reason
then
to
believe
that
this
result
would
ever
be
repeated,
and
as
a
result,
invalidation
of
the
statute
would
be
wholly
inappropriate.
respondent
is
concerned
as
well
that
perhaps
petitioners
have
exaggerated
the
possibility
of
borderline
cases
or
unconstitutional
verdicts
when
this
community
based
standard
of
review
is
used...
or
community
based
standard
of
value
determinations
is
used.
in
addition
to
the
broad
powers
of
the
appellate
courts,
there's
a
number
of
other
important
safeguards
here.
a
defendant
is
always
free
to
seek
jurors
with
diverse
experiences
and
particular
backgrounds
during
his
voir
dire
examination.
expert
testimony
will
always
be
permissible
under
our
approach
to
establish
the
value
of
a
particular
work
or
to
define
the
relevant
community
attitudes.
the
return
a
guilty
verdict,
the
jury
must
deliberate
within
the
confines
of
the
miller
decision,
and
the
jury
must
also
find
prurient
appeal
and
patently
offense
sexual
conduct.
the
prosecution
bears
a
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
all
three
of
the
miller
tests,
and
so
there
is
a
presumption
of
nonobscenity
in
these
cases.
defendants
will
receive
all
of
the
safeguards
of
any
prosecution,
including
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
i
would
submit,
as
well,
that
authors
and
distributors
already
know
the
types
of
hard-core
sexual
conduct
that
might
be
deemed
to
be
patently
offense.
and
their
own
pandering
activities,
just
like
in
this
case,
will
legitimately
increase
the
risk
that
a
particular
work
may
be
found
to
be
obscene.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
my
point,
your
honor--
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
--speaking
with
respect
to
the
second
issue
raised
by
petitioners,
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
our
position
is
that
no
illinois
court,
and
neither
the
old
nor
the
new
illinois
statute,
have
ever
required
the
application
of
community
determinations
for
value.
this
is
not
a
result
which
is
required
in
illinois.
i
agree
that
this
is
the
best
approach.
it
is
the
approach
that
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt.
but
i
wish
to
clear
up
any
confusion
engendered
by
petitioners
when
he
says
that
the
illinois
courts
have...
have
mandated
this
approach
in
the
past.
that
simply
is
not
the
case.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
absolutely.
and
the
appellate
court
only
said,
on
appeal,
that
they
refused
to
reverse
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
said
nothing
more.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
to
the
extent
that
we
could
read
anything
from
a
silent
opinion,
i
could
only
submit
to
you
that
there
is
no
directive
in
there
to
require
this
result
in
a
future
case.
there's
no
affirmative
language,
in
the
statute
or
any
of
the
court...
or
any
of
the
cases
concerning
this
statute
that
would
require
this
conclusion.
ms.
sally
louise
dilgart
i
think
i'd
like
to
make
some
concluding
remarks,
if
there
are
no
other
particular
areas
which
the
court
wishes
to
investigate.
i'd
like
to
summarize
and
tell
you
that
value
determinations
should
be
made
with
reference
to
the
views
of
ordinary
adults
living
within
the
community.
to
us,
that
is
the
soundest
approach.
it
rejects
the
hickman
test.
it
assures
that
the
first
amendment
will
be
satisfied
by
rejecting
intolerant
or
personal
views.
and
it
also,
unlike
petitioners'
standards,
gives
an
affirmative
guide
to
the
jury.
it
tells
them
not
only
what
they
cannot
consider,
but
also,
where
they
must
look
in
making
this
important
determination.
jurors
traditionally
have
been
allowed
to
rely
on
their
own
knowledge
and
experiences.
and
they
should
be
permitted
here,
once
again,
to
do
so.
they
should
be
permitted
to
rely
on
their
own
knowledge
and
experience
in
the
community
in
making
these
determinations.
but
even
if
a
noncommunity
approach
should
be
necessary
here,
thenl
petitioners'
convictions
should
nevertheless
be
affirmed,
because
these
petitioners
pandered
hard-core
pornography,
found
by
a
jury
to
be
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
as
this
court
has
observed
in
miller,
to
equate
a
robust
exchange
of
ideas
with
the
commercial
exploitation
of
obscenity
is
merely
to
demean
the
first
amendment.
thank
you.
