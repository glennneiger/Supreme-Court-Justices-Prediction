we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-1973,
pope
against
illinois.
mr.
stanko,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
are
you
saying
that
the
jury
here
then
should
simply
evaluate
on
its
own
whether
or
not
there's
redeeming
value?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
sort
of
evidence
would
be
admissible,
under
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
would
the
judge
charge
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
wouldn't
say
any...
he
wouldn't
have
to
say
anything
else
that,
you
know,
you
must
give
some
consideration
to
the
expert
testimony
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
difference
would
this
make
in
the
outcome
of
any
case?
you
know,
juries,
i
think,
apply
community
standards
whether
they're
told
to
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
jurors
would
do
that
without
any
more
charge
than
you've
suggested
from
the
judge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
was
this
case
tried?
in
chicago?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rockford.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
winnebago
county.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
population
of
that
country?
about
100-,
150,000?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
250,000.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stanko--
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
dilgart.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
dilgart,
in
jenkins
v.
georgia,
we
reviewed,
was
it,
a
patently
offensive
determination,
and
said
there
just
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
support
a
patently
offensive.
and
i
gather
that
all
concede
that
"patently
offensive"
should
go
under
community
standards.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
the
first
part
of
the
first
prong
of
miller?
the
things
that
were
permitted
and
not
permitted
as
described
in
miller?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
did
affirm
this
conviction,
where
the
trial
judge
had
charged
that
community
standards
should
be
applied
in
determining
the
third
part.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
dilgart.
mr.
stanko,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
