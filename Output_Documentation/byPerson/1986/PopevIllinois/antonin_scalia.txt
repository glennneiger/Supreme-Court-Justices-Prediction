justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
stanko,
i
don't
understand
your
point
when
you
say
that
the
issue
is
whether,
you
know,
the
majority
can
run
roughshod
over...
it
really
isn't
an
issue
of
whether
the
majority
can
or
not.
your
complaint
is
that
it
has
to
be
the
majority
that
does
it,
and
that
you
can't
use
community
standards.
you're
perfectly
willing
to
have
literary
works
banned
because
the
majority
considers
that
they
have
no
literary
merit.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
you're
insisting
is
that
it
be
a
nationwide
standard
and
not
a
community
standard.
it's
just
a
question
of
how
big
the
majority
has
to
be,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
then
i
don't
understand
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
instruction
did
you
request?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say,
you've
sort
of
thrown
me
off.
because
i...
it's
not
your
fault,
i
suppose,
but
i
had
thought
you
were
seeking...
as
i
think
the
chief
justice
thought...
that
you
were
seeking
an
implicit
instruction
that
the
third
part
has
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
national
standards.
but
you're
not.
all
you
want
is
the
absence
of
an
instruction
that
it
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
community
standards?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
there's
a
third
category:
fact,
law
and
taste.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stanko,
i
was
not
being
entirely
facetious
when
i
said,
you
know,
there
may
be
three
categories.
you
put
it
to
us
as
though
the
question
of
whether
it
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value,
or
under
the
modern
test,
whether
it
has
any
literary
or
artistic
merit,
is
simply
a
question
of
reality.
it
either
does
or
doesn't.
but
you
know
there's
a
latin
maxim...
the
point
is
so
well
known
that
there's
latin
maxim:
de
gustibus
non
est
disputandum.
it's
no
use
arguing
about
matters
of
taste.
you
can't
say
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
a
particular
work
of
modern
art
is,
you
know,
has
artistic
merit
or
not.
some
people
will
say
it's
wonderful;
other
people
will
say
it's
terrible.
now,
i
can
understand
how
a
jury
or
a
court
can
decide
that
matter
on
the
basis
of
either
local
community
standards,
that
is,
most
of
the
people
in
this
community
think
it's
a
nice
piece
of
art,
or
even
national
standards,
most
of
the
people
nationally
think
it's
good
art.
but
i
don't
see
how
a
jury
is
to
abstract
itself
from
community
standards
and
decide,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
whether
this
is
good
art
or
not.
isn't
that
utterly
unrealistic?
aren't
you
really
driven
to
telling
the
jury,
either
use
local
standards
or
use
national
standards?
you
can't
tell
them,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
a
campbell's
soup
can
good
art
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
each
one
is
to
judge
on
the
basis
of
his
own
determination,
not
looking
to
national
standards,
do
art
critics
nationally
think
so,
do
other
communities
think
so,
but
rather,
the
juror
is
to
look
at
it
and
say,
this
has
artistic
merit.
that's
what
you
want
them
to
ask
the
jury
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
art
is
personal
opinion,
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
you
look
to
a
national
standard
or
a
community
standard,
there's
nothing
else
but
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you're
back
to
saying
that
what
the
instruction
has
to
be,
ask
the
jury
whether
nationally
a
lot
of
people
would
consider
this
to
have
artistic
merit.
so
you
are
saying
that
they
are
to
apply
a
national
standard;
not
their
own
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
just
said.
if
a
minority
of
people
think
it
has
value,
it
has
value.
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be
true,
but
how
do
you
charge
the
jury?
do
you
charge
the
jury,
if
any
minority
of
people
think
this
has
value,
you
have
to
let
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you're
confident
that
on
the
basis
of
that
instruction
the
jury
is
going
to
come
to
a
conclusion
that
if
a
minority
somewhere
thinks
it
has
redeeming
social
value,
the
jury
has
to
find
it
has
redeeming
social
value?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
find
that
a
confusing
xxx
way
as
a
juror
member
who
got
that
charge.
i
wouldn't
think
that
that's
what
it
meant,
if
there's
a
minority
who
likes
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
the
publisher
who
thinks
that
he
has
something
of
artistic
merit,
but
it
has
material
in
it
that
he
thinks
would
offend
some
communities'
sensitivities,
explicit
sexual
material.
nonetheless,
he
thinks
it
has
artistic
merit,
and
he
would
be
very
confident
to
send
it
out
there
under
our
three-part
test
except
that
there
may
be
some
little
community
that
just
doesn't
like
this
kind
of
art.
now
you're
saying
he's
just
at
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
what
the
community
thought
was
good
art
and
what
was
bad
art?
i
think
it's
a
lot
easier
to
learn
the
community
standard
on
the
first
two
points
than
on
the
third.
i
have
no
idea
what
they
consider
good
art
out...
i
don't
even
know
what
they
consider
good
art
inside
the
beltway.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
general
dilgart,
before
you
get
to
that,
you
asserted
earlier
that
it
doesn't
matter
here
anyway,
because
even
under
the
standard
that
the
petitioner
asserts,
these
magazines
would
have
failed.
why
isn't
this
just
a
typical
first
amendment
situation
in
which
a
party
is
allowed
to
raise
the
rights
of
a
third
party
not
before
the
court?
that
is,
even
though
this
petitioner
has
no
proper
cause
to
complain,
there
are
other
people
who
do
have
cause
to
complain,
and
he's
allowed
to
assert
their
attacks
on
the
statute.
why
doesn't
that
line
of
cases
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
indicated
what?
i
didn't...
indicated
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
be
relaxed?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
exactly
my
point.
so
the
petitioner
here
would
be
allowed
to
raise
points
that
he
has
no
real
reason
to
complain
of,
but
somebody
else
has
reason
to
complain
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
this
is
not
overbreadth...
okay,
i'll
have
to
think
about
that.
well
in
any
event,
we
have
to
determine
whether
the
convictions
can
stand,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
dilgart,
go
back
a
minute
or
so
ago.
maybe
i
was
dozing
off.
but
you
said
there
was
no
requirement
here
that
the
jury
use
community
standards,
and
it's
unlikely
that
there
would
be
a
requirement
in
the
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
this
case
was
about,
and
i
thought
almost
all
of
your
preceding
argument
was
directed
at
the
validity
of
using
community
standards.
and
now
you're
telling
me
that
this
case
doesn't
involve
the
use
of
community
standards?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
you
mean
maybe
they're
going
to
allow
community
standards
sometimes
and
not
allow
it
other
times?
you
don't
want
us
to
think
that
that's
what
they're
doing,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
the
point
you're
making.
