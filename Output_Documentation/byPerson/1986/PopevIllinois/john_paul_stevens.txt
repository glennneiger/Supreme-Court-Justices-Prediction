mr.
stanko,
may
i
interrupt
you
on
that
point?
is
it
your
view
that
the
value
determination
is
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
a
little
unclear.
you
say
it's
a
question
that
has
to
be
reviewed
independently.
is
it
sort
of
on
a
de
novo
standard,
the
judge's
own
view
of
whether
there's
value
there?
or
whether
the
jury
could
permissibly
think
there
was
no
value
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
what
i'm
really
asking,
i
guess,
is,
do
you
think
the
scope
of
review,
on
an
appeal
or
by
the
judge
ruling
on
a
motion
in
the
trial
court
is
any
different
on
the
third
element
than
it
is
on
the
first
two
elements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
stanko,
it
occurs
to
me,
there
might
be
cases
in
which
it
would
be
more
favorable
to
the
defendant
to
use
the
local
standard
rather
than
the
national
standard.
supposing
you
had
a
work
that
had
special
appeal
to
scandanavians,
who
would
understand
some
particular
message;
or
it
might
appeal
to
a
lot
of
people
in
rockford
but
not
nationwide.
so
maybe
there
would
be
cases
it
seems
to
me
where
you
might
be
better
off
with
a
local
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
in
order
to
decide
this
case
we
have
to
read
these
magazines?
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
they
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
parts
that
you're
saying
we
should
look
at?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
portions
of
the
magazines
that
you
think
we
should
look
at
in
the
joint
appendix?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
think
we
should
read
them,
even
though
you
didn't
bother
to
put
them
in
the
joint
appendix?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
following
up
on
justice
scalia's
thought,
supposing
a
publisher
had
a
book
that
he
wanted
to
sell
in
illinois,
and
he's
in
new
york,
and
he
took
it
to
the
art
critic
or
the
literary
critic
of
the
new
york
times,
and
that
person
told
him,
this
has
got
a
lot
of
value.
it's
going
to
be
great
art
in
the
next
couple
of
generations.
and
he
asks
somebody
at
the
chicago
tribune,
and
he
says,
this
is
junk.
don't
bother
selling
it
in
illinois.
i
take
it
the
evidence
of
what
the
new
york
times
critic
told
him
would
not
even
be
admissible
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
relevant
to
the
value
as
measured
by
the
illinois
standard?
why
would
the
new
york
time's
critic's
opinion
have
any
value
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
new
york
times
critic
said
to
the
author,
this
is
great
stuff
in
new
york
and
east
of
the
hudson,
but
i
know
they
wouldn't
like
it
in
illinois.
it
would
be
considered
junk
in
illinois.
would
his
evidence
be
admissible
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
this
argument,
you're
saying
even
if
the
statute
is
obviously
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
of
course
you
don't.
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument,
you
could
assume
we've
got
an
unconstitutional
statute
here;
we've
got
an
unconstitutional
instruction
to
the
jury.
but
these
people
are
really
guilty,
so
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
all
that
stuff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
instruction
was
obviously
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
even
if
it
were
obviously
unconstitutional,
you'd
still
say
it
wasn't,
because
there's
no
evidence
of...
in
your
view
there's
no
evidence
of
redeeming
social
value.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
even
if
the
instruction
is
unconstitutional,
and
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
we
should
still
affirm.
