mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
constitutional
test
for
obscenity
which
is
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
contains
three
parts,
each
part
of
which
must
exist
separately
and
independently
in
order
for
a
work
to
be
found
obscene.
the
third
part
of
that
three-part
test,
the
third
component,
is
a
value
consideration.
and
that
value
consideration
has
been
specifically
crafted
to
protect
works
having
value
from
hostile
majoritarian
sentiment.
richard
pope
and
charles
morrison
were
both
tried
under
a
state
of
illinois
statute
which
allowed
the
views
of
a
majority
to
determine
the
question
of
whether
the
work
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
in
short,
community
standards
were
applied
to
the
value
consideration.
that
illinois
obscenity
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
each
and
every
possible
application,
no
matter
to
whom
applied
or
to
what
applied,
whether
it's
a
retailer,
a
distributor,
a
publisher,
or,
as
in
this
case,
a
clerk
in
an
adult
bookstore,
or
whether
it's
applied
to
a--
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
subsequent
to
the
convictions
in
this
case,
the
state
of
illinois
passed
a
new
obscenity
statute.
i
think
it's
instructive
to
note
that
the
obscenity
statute
put
into
place
by
the
state
of
illinois
legislature
conforms
precisely
to
the
construction
for
which
we
argue
in
this
case.
and
explicitly,
it
puts
community
standards
into
the
first
element
of
the
test,
which
is
the
patently
offensive
part
of
the
test.
it
includes
community
standards
in
the
second
element,
which
is
the...
excuse
me,
the
first
is
prurient
interest;
the
second
is
patently
offensive.
and
it
omits
community
standards
from
the
value
determination.
so
what
we
have
is
the
state
of
illinois
arguing
for
a
construction
of
the
statute
which
is
really
consistent...
inconsistent
with
what
it
has
on
the
books
right
now.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
that's
not
true
at
all.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
i'm
not
arguing
for
a
standard.
and
i
think
it's
improper
to
characterize
it
as
a
standard.
the
value
determination
is
a
focus.
the
jury
should
look
at
value
and
determine
it,
just
as
it
determines
similar
elements
in
any
other
criminal
case.
if
you
try
an
aggravated
battery
case,
for
instance,
the
jury
looks
to
determine
whether
great
bodily
harm
was
done
to
the
individual.
they're
not
told
to
look
through
the
eyes
of
the
community
and
decide
whether
the
average
person
applying
some
standard
would
find
that
great
bodily
harm
was
done.
they
take
the
facts
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
evaluate
whether
great
bodily
harm
was
done.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
i'm
saying
that
the
jury
should
evaluate
based
on
the
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
any
evidence
which
would
relate
to
the
value
of
the
particular
work.
it
might
be,
such
as
in
jenkins
v.
georgia,
evidence
of
reviews,
criticisms.
it
might
be
expert
testimony
relating
to
the
work.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
the
judge
would
do
more
than
charge
the
jury
that
they
are
to
determine
if
the
work,
in
illinois,
under
this
statute,
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
he
would
not
charge
them
that
they
apply
that...
they
determine
that
applying
contemporary
community
standards.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
no,
i
don't
think
he
has
to
say
anything
about
the
expert
testimony.
he
does,
as
in
any
criminal
case,
and
as
occurred
in
these
two
cases,
tell
the
jury
to
use...
to
evaluate
the
evidence
using
their
own
observations
and
experiences
in
life.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
because
in
many
cases,
particularly
when
you
have
a
small
community,
the
jury
could
ascertain
that
in
this
community
this
work
would
be
found
to
be
unacceptable,
and
we
find
that
it
would
be
obscene,
applying
contemporary
community
standards.
but
if
we
sit
back
and
divorce
the
feelings
of
the
community
from
the
inquiry
itself,
we
find
that,
yes,
this
work
does
have
some
value.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
i
think
they
can
and
do
that
everyday,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
there
was
no
evidence
offered
in
either
one
of
these
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
well,
in
each
of
these
cases,
an
attack
was
made
on
the
validity
of
the
statute,
both
as
written
and
construed.
the
attack
was
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
allowed
community
standards
to
be
applied
to
the
value
consideration.
that
is
sufficient,
certainly
under
illinois
law,
to
raise
the
constitutional
issue.
there's
no
requirement
that
evidence,
or
an
attempt
to
present
evidence--
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
--that's
correct.
we
lost...
the
statute
was
effectively
construed
by
the
trial
judge
to
include
community
standards
in
the
consideration.
so
at
that
point
to
present
evidence,
unless
it
was
within
the
community
itself,
of
value,
would
have
been
nothing
more
than
a
useful
ceremony.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
that's
correct.
but
under
illinois
law,
no
such
offer
would
be
required
to
preserve
the
issue.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
yes,
there
was.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
the
phrasing
of
the
instruction
allowed
the
jury
to
apply
community
standards,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
in
the
morrison
case,
there
was
a
specific
instruction
which
included
community
standards
in
the
first
two
elements
and
excluded
it
from
the
third
element.
there
was
another
instruction
which
would
have,
by
itself,
advised
the
jury
that
they
could
consider
community
standards
only
on
the
first
two
parts
of
the
test.
in
the
pope
case,
because
of
the
construction
given
by
the
trial
court
both
in
that
case
and
in
the
earlier
morrison
case,
there
was
no
separate
instruction
tendered
by
the
defense
relating
to
community
standards.
the
instruction
was
crafted
along
the
construction
given
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
well,
the
relief
sought
in
each
case
flows
from
a
constitutional
facial
attack
on
the
statute.
and
the
facial
attack
is
that
the
statute
allows
community
standards
to
come
in
on
the
third
element.
flowing
from
that
is
the
instruction
issue
that
as
a
result
of
that
instruction,
juries
are
being
instructed
that
community
standards
are
to
be
applied
to
all
three
elements.
we
would
be
more
than
happy
to
not
have
a
specific
instruction
which
says,
you
may
only
apply
it
to
the
first
two
elements,
but
just
have
an
instruction
that
lays
out
the
elements
of
the
test,
put
community
into
the
first
two
elements,
leave
it
out
of
the
third
element,
and
the
jury
has
what
it
needs
to
make
its
consideration.
one
of
the
promises
of
miller
was
that
the
first
amendment
protects
works
which,
taken
as
a
whole,
have
serious
literary,
artistic,
political
or
scientific
value,
regardless
of
whether
the
government,
or
regardless
of
whether
a
majority
of
the
people
approve
of
the
ideas
in
that
particular
work.
majoritarian
rule
is
the
essence
of
contemporary
community
standards.
and
ultimately,
i
think,
the
state
of
illinois
recognizes
that
that
is
the
vice
to
be
protected
against
in
its
brief.
page
31,
it
says,
the
courts
of
review
are
the
protectors
of
expression
from
suppression
by
majority
rule.
well,
certainly
if
the
courts
of
review
are
the
protectors,
the
jury
in
the
first
instance
should
be
the
protector.
page
21,
respondent
admits--
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
--it's
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
for
a
court
of
review,
i
believe
it
would
be
categorized
as
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
to
decide.
it's
a
constitutional
fact
which
any
court
of
review
has
to
review
independently.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
well,
i
suppose
taste
might
enter
into
the
court's
determination
of
the
fact,
but
that's
the
way
i
would
view--
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
--beginning
with
jacobellis
v.
ohio
and
on
through
the
miller
line
of
cases,
smith
v.
united
states,
this
court
has
recognized
in
an
obscenity
case
any
appellate
court,
and
ultimately
this
court,
has
an
independent...
has
an
obligation
to
independently
constitutionally
review
the
facts
pertaining
to
obscenity.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
i
think
it's
broader
on
the
third
element,
your
honor,
necessarily
so.
because
when
community
standards
are
applied
to
patently
offensive
or
to
prurient
interest,
certainly
an
appellate
court,
in
a
state
that
might
have
a
countywide
standard,
or
this
court,
is
not
going
to
be
in
a
position
to
know
what
the
community
standards
were.
so
by
necessity,
there's
going
to
be
some
limitation
of
the
review.
when
you
get
to
the
value
element,
you're
in
a
position
to
look
at
everything
without
community
standards
being
superimposed.
recognition
was
given
to
that
in
smith
v.
united
states:
the
third
element
of
the
test
is
particularly
amenable
to
judicial
review.
now,
i
believe
that's
correct.
i
believe
that's
kind
of
the
tie
that
binds
everything
together
when
you
get
up
into
the
appellate
court
or
to
this
court.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
there
are
many
situations
in
which
something
may
have
value,
but
only
a
minority
of
people,
but
not
to
a
majority
of
people.
if
you
look
at
many
of
the
works
that
were
held
obscene
years
ago...
ulysses,
god's
little
acre...
any
number
of
things
that
state
courts
held
obscene,
you
will
understand
that
the
majority
might
dislike
something
that
ultimately
does
have
value,
does
have
importance
to
someone.
i
think
a
jury
can
understand
the
concept
that,
okay,
a
majority
of
people
in
this
community
don't
particularly
care
for
this
work,
but
we
see
that
it
conveys
an
idea,
we
see
that
it
conveys
information,
that
could
have
importance
to
some
portion
of
our
society.
we're
going
to
set
aside
those
feelings
of
the
community
and
say,
this
work
does
have
redeeming
social
value
of
some
sort.
and
i
think
a
jury...
it's
difficult--
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
--i
want
the
jury
to
look
at
it
based
on
the
evidence.
i
don't
want
the
jury
to
decide
it
based
on
personal
opinion.
and
certainly
jurors
are
instructed
not
to
apply
their
own
personal
opinion.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
well--
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
--i
would
suggest
that
evidence
can
be
adduced
about
works
that
could
show
the
jury
that
although
their
taste
did
not
extend
to
these
works,
that
there
was
a
significant
segment
of
society
had
value.
look
at
the--
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
--the
evidence
could
be
national
in
scope.
and
certainly
if
the
evidence
came
in
from
washington,
d.c.,
that
a
particular
work
had
value,
an
illinois
jury
could
consider
that
evidence.
but
when
you
talk
about
a
standard,
you're
talking
about
comparing
one
thing
to
another.
and
a
standard
implies
a
majority
determination
of
some
kind.
we
are
not
asking
the
jury
to
compare
the
value
of
a
work
to
a
majority
determination
across
the
united
states.
we
are
asking
the
jury
to
look
at
whatever
evidence
may
be
available,
whether
it's
in
the
state
of
illinois,
or
whether
it's
on
the
west
coast
or
up
in
maine
or
whatever,
regarding
this
particular
work,
and
make
a
decision
whether
or
not
it
has
some
value.
i
think
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
no.
no,
other
than
putting
in
the
term,
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value,
that
was
the
extent
of
it.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
community
standards
applied
to
all
three
elements,
yes.
and
i
don't
this
case
is
really
a
case
where--
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
--no.
well,
ordinarily
adults
in
the
state
of
illinois.
the
community
in...
the
community
in
the
state
of
illinois,
in
every
case,
no
matter
where
tried,
is
a
statewide
standard.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
that's
a
statewide
standard,
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
yes,
they
are.
the
value
independent,
an
independent
value
element,
is
extremely
important
to
anyone
whose
in
the
business
of
publication,
distribution
of
literature
of
any
kind.
it's
difficult
to
determine
what
the
community
standard
is
from
state
to
state,
county
to
county,
city
to
city.
and
certainly
anyone
in
the
national
publishing
business
would
not
realistically
be
in
a
position
to
do
that.
but
if
that
person
who
wants
to
disseminate
the
material
knows
that
that
material
has
value
in
it,
then
that
person
has
a
safe
harbor.
all
lawyers
like
to
look
for
the
safe
harbors.
well,
in
obscenity,
the
safe
harbor
is,
i
may
have
a
work
that
some
patently
offensive
sexual
conduct,
i
may
have
a
work
that
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest,
but
i
also
know
this
work
has
value.
and
knowing
that,
even
if
the
ideas
i
convey
are
unorthodox,
even
if
they're
unpopular,
i
can
go
ahead
and
convey
that
material,
i
can
sell
that
material,
whether
or
not
it
is
consistent
with
the
norms
of
taste
in
the
community.
on
the
other
hand,
an
obscenity
statute
such
as
illinois',
as
it
has
been
construed,
has
a
negative
impact.
any
determination
of
obscenity
is
made
on
a
parochial
basis.
prevailing
local
tastes
become
the
standard.
and
the
resulting
chill
destroys
the
opportunity
for
persons
to
have
unimpeded
access
to
information
and
ideas.
i
think
this
idea
of
unimpeded
access
is
important.
and
if
we
look
back
20,
25
years
ago,
there
are
many
things
that
a
majority
of
the
people
would
have
felt
were
not
of
value;
certain
information
about
contraception.
the
joy
of
sex
is
a
book
that--
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
--it's
a
state
of
illinois
standard.
somehow
chicago
is
amalgamated
into
the
state
of
illinois
for
determining
the
standard.
but
they
would
be,
for
terms
of
trying
a
case,
going
into
the
city,
you
have
to
ascertain
the
community
standard
for
that
particular
city.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
no,
this
case
was
tried
in
rockford.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
ninety
miles
northwest
of
chicago.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
the
jury
was
selected
on
a...
juries
in
illinois
of
course
come
from
the
country.
so
what
you
are
in
a
position
of
having
a
jury
from
one
particular
country
ascertain
what
the
statewide
community
standard
is.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
of
winnebago
county?
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
250,000.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
the
idea
is,
with
majoritarian
rule,
when
it
comes
to
value,
we
freeze
the
state
of
knowledge
on
certain
things.
if
the
idea
is
not
acceptable
to
the
majority,
it
doesn't
have
the
opportunity
to
germinate;
it
doesn't
have
the
opportunity
to
develop.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
let
an
idea
that
may
be
acceptable
to
a
minority
of
people
grow,
if
we
don't
ban
it
just
because
a
majority
of
people
feel
it's
an
unpopular
idea,
an
unorthodox
idea,
then
at
some
point
in
the
future,
15
or
20
years
from
now,
it
may
have
worth
to
a
significant
segment
of
society.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
we
suppress
works
based
on
majority
view,
then
works
that
may
have
value,
albeit
to
a
significant...
albeit
to
a
majority...
minority
of
society,
may
never
have
the
opportunity
to
grow
and
develop.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
well,
i
don't
think
case
involves
the
scope
of
what
the
charge
would
be.
but
going
beyond
that,
i
think
you
charge
the
jury
that
the
jury
determines
whether
the
work
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value,
and
leave
it
at
that,
and
let
the
jury
make
its
determination
based
on
the
evidence
and
based
on
other
instructions
given.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
i
think
if
there's
evidence
to
that
effect,
and
the
jury
believes
that
evidence,
it
can
make
that
determination.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
well,
certainly,
there
would
be
opportunities
for
states
to
develop
that
charge.
and
once
again,
the
scope
of
this
case,
the
issue
in
this
case,
doesn't
involve
exactly
how
you
would
charge
the
jury.
the
question
is,
are
you
going
to
let
the
jury
make
the
determination
based
on
what
a
majority
of
people
feel
about
the
work
in
the
community?
are
you
going
to
let
parochial
test
prevail?
and
that's
what
should
be
avoided.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
well,
that
may
be
true.
but
at
the
same
time,
if
that's
correct,
then
evidence
could
be
brought
in
to
bear
on
the
value
determination,
and
i
think
that
evidence
will
be
relevant
on
how
the
jury
ultimately
decides
that
question.
obscenity
is
both
a
local
and
a
national
concern.
and
certainly
this
court
in
miller,
when
it
told
us
that
the
people
in
one
city
or
country
do
not
have
to
accept
what
people
in
another
city
or
county
find
tolerable,
indicated
that.
in
smith,
we
were
also
told
that
to
the
extent
that
local
concern
is
relevant,
the
jury's
application
of
contemporary
community
standards
fully
satisfies
that
interest.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
the
interest
that
fundamental
limitations
on
the
first
amendment...
fundamental
limitations
on
the
state
through
the
first
amendment
do
not
vary
from
community
to
community.
if
the
local
community
standards,
and
the
values,
are
to
be
tied
together,
ultimately
it's
the
value
concern
which
gives
the
works
the
national
protection.
it's
a
consistent
element.
it's
always
there
for
a
court
of
review
to
draw
on.
ultimately
it's
here
for
the
supreme
court
to
draw
on.
and
it's
been
present
ever
since
the
beginning
when
roth
was
decided.
although
not
stated
as
part
of
the
test
in
roth,
value
was
certainly
talked
about,
and
the
court
said
that
something
was
obscene
only
because
it
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
it
was
present
again
explicitly
in
memoirs
when
we
used...
when
the
court
used
an
"utterly
without
redeeming
social
value"
test.
and
finally,
in
miller,
when
the
more
restrictive
"lacking
serious
literary,
artistic,
political
or
scientific
value.
"
was
adopted,
it
was
present.
it's
always
been
there.
and
it's
always
been
there
for
a
jury
or
a
court,
an
appellate
court
or
this
court,
to
reach
in
and
rescue
a
work
because
a
parochial
jury
had
determined
that
work
to
be
obscene.
and
that's
really
consistent
with
what
we
talked
about
earlier,
the
scope
of
review,
particularly
amenable
to
judicial
review,
as
this
court
indicated
in
smith.
the
illinois
obscenity
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
each
and
every
application.
it's
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
mr.
pope
and
morrison.
it
would
be
unconstitutional
no
matter
to
whom
or
to
what
applied,
in
any
circumstances.
sensitive
tools
are
required
to
operate
along
that
dim,
uncertain
line
between
protected
speech
and
obscenity.
this
is
not
a
sensitive
tool.
this
is
a
bludgeon.
we
would
ask
the
court,
as
it
did
in
pinkus,
pinkus
v.
united
states,
where
children
were
included
in
the
community,
to
reverse
the
conviction
in
this
case.
we
would
also
ask
the
court
to
hold
the
statute
facially
invalid.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
this
isn't
a
construction
of
the
statute,
i
don't
know
what
is.
the
issue
was
presented
to
the
illinois
appellate
court.
the
illinois
appellate
court
resolved
the
issue
by
saying,
it
should
also
be
noted
that
thus
far
the
united
states
supreme
court
has
never
held
that
an
objective
standard
as
opposed
to
a
community
one
should
be
applied
in
the
judging
of
materials
on
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
when
you
combine
that
with
some
language
in
the
statute
about
interpretation
of
evidence,
it
says,
obscenity
shall
be
judged
with
reference
to
ordinary
adults,
you
have
a
construction
of
the
statute.
and
i
don't
think
the
state
ever
argued
in
their
briefs
that
there
was
no
construction
of
the
statute.
to
answer
justice
stevens
questions,
no,
justice
stevens,
you
do
not
have
to
view
the
materials
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
isn't
whether
the
materials
are
obscene.
the
issue
is
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
illinois
obscenity
statute.
that
statute,
as
applied
to
my
clients,
and
as
applied
to
anyone
else
in
the
world,
or
in
the
state
of
illinois,
is
unconstitutional.
you
don't
even
get
into
the
broderick
overbreadth
analysis.
because
there
is
no
application
of
this
statute
which
conceivably
could
be
constitutional.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
no,
but
there
was
language
incorporated
into
the
jury
instructions
from
the
statute.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
well,
they
would
have
been
in
error.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
if
the--
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
--if
the
jury
instruction
had
not
included
community
standards
on
the
third
element,
you're
right,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
but
that
would
have
been
a
construction
of
the
statute
consistent
with
what
we
argue
for.
and
that
didn't
happen.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
in
one
case.
in
the
first
case...
there's
two
cases...
in
morrison,
which
was
the
first
one
tried,
defendants
tendered
instructions
which
would
limit
community
standards
to
the
first
two
elements.
they
also
tendered...
the
defendant
also
tendered
another
instruction
which
would
say
specifically
that
you
only
apply
community
standards
to
the
first
two
elements.
mr.
glenn
a.
stanko
right.
and
pope
was
tried
after
morrison
in
front
of
the
same
trial
judge,
and
after
denial
of
the
same
motion
asserting
that
community
standards
should
not
be
included
in
the
statute.
so
we
already
had
a
construction
from
the
state
court
judge
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do.
we
tendered
the
most
favorable
instruction
we
could
get,
consistent
with
that
construction.
i'd
like
to
answer
one
of
your
concerns,
justice
o'connor,
when
you
asked,
well,
what
standard
would
this
court
apply
in
reviewing
materials?
i
think
you
recognize
the
problem,
and
that
is,
that
if
you
apply
community
standards
to
the
value
component,
how
does
this
court
review
the
materials
if
you're
not
familiar
with
the
community
standards
in
the
state
of
illinois.
and
one
has
to
remember
that
in
many
cases
the
state
is
not
required
to
put
on
evidence...
in
all
cases,
the
state
is
not
required
to
put
on
evidence
of
contemporary
community
standards.
so
there
really
could
be
no
meaningful
judicial
review
of
that
particular
finding.
in
response
to
a
question
of
yours,
justice
stevens,
i
think
i
heard
counsel
say
that
evidence
of
value
in
new
york
could
not
be
admitted
in
illinois
if
the
state's
construction
was
adopted.
and
that's
the
problem.
that
illustrates
the
problem.
in
jenkins,
which
was
a
georgia
case,
there
was
all
kinds
of
evidence
about
national
acclaim,
critical
reviews;
that
type
of
information.
the
court
even
took
judicial
notice
of
information
not
originally
in
the
record.
now
jenkins,
of
course,
didn't
decide
the
case
on
value.
but
i
don't
think
this
court
would
or
has
suggested
that
evidence
outside
a
particular
community
should
not
be
relevant
to
the
constitutional
determination.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
will
not
speak
any
further.
