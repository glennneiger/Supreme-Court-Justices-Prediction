justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
luffman,
i
just
don't
remember
in
this
case.
how
did
the
fact
that
your
client
had
been
hypnotized
come
to
the
attention
of
the
court?
justice
stevens
and
one
of
your
witnesses--
justice
stevens
--and
she,
of
course,
did
not
testify
at
the
trial?
justice
stevens
at
the
pre-trial.
justice
stevens
and
the
record
is
gone
but
i
assume
she
testified
that
she
did
not
suggest
this
particular
recollection
to
the
witness.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
but
did
they
know
about
it
at
the
time
of
trial?
justice
stevens
well
in
this
case,
but
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
defendant's
knew
about
the
hypnotism
in
the
cline
case
at
the
time
of
the
trial
xxx.
justice
stevens
in
this
case,
the
reason
that
you
learned
about
the
hypnotism
of
the
defendant
was
the
defense
counsel
listed
the
psychiatrist,
or
whatever
his
profession
is,
as
a
witness.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
is
it
correct
that
at
the
hearing,
the
record
of
which
is
lost,
that
that
expert
whoever
it
was
testified
that
she
had
not
induced
this
particular
scenario
of
what
happened
about
the
pulling
the
trigger.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
your
view
of
interpreting
the
arkansas
supreme
court's
decision.
supposing
the
trial
judge
had
heard
all
this
testimony
and
was
persuaded,
and
apparently
not
in
this
case,
was
persuaded
that
the
hypnotism
did
nothing
but
make
her
refresh
her
recollection
and
she
may
well
have
been
telling
the
truth.
would
the
testimony
have
still
have
been
inadmissible
under
your
understanding
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court's--
justice
stevens
--because
it's
frequently
unreliable.
justice
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
this
be
a
matter
of
expert
testimony?
justice
stevens
well
isn't
it
also
true,
general
clark,
that
there
are
instance
in
which
hypnotism
has
enabled
people
to
recollect
things
they
have
not
previously
remembered?
justice
stevens
so
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
although
it
perhaps
it's
highly
unlikely,
it
is
at
least
possible
that
the
testimony
she
wanted
to
give
was
the
truth.
justice
stevens
what
if
you
had
a,
say
there
are
drugs
as
i
understand
that
are
called
truth,
and
i
can't
remember
the
name.
justice
stevens
that
presumably,
or
at
least
some
people
think
they
cause
a
person
to
tell
the
truth.
other
people
might
think
otherwise.
could
a
court
totally
exclude
the
testimony
of
a
witness
who
had
taken
such
a
drug?
justice
stevens
right.
that's
right.
justice
stevens
but
your
rule
as
i
understand
this
case,
doesn't
even
allow
the
trial
judge
discretion
to
admit
this
testimony.
justice
stevens
even
if
he
was
persuaded
by
the
pre-trial
hearing
he'd
say
i'm
sorry,
we
have
a
flat
rule
against.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
how
will
you
enforce
this
rule
against
an
unscrupulous
defense
lawyer
who
just
doesn't
tell
you
about
hypnotic
sessions.
justice
stevens
or
maybe
the
lawyer
doesn't
even
find
out
about
it.
maybe
the
defendant
on
his
own,
or
her
own,
goes
to
the
hypnotist,
just
says
i
can't
remember
everything,
please
help
me.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
but,
let
me
just
ask
you
about
that.
you
say,
here
the
story
was
that
she
didn't
pull
the
trigger,
it
was
capable
of
just
discharging
from
the
scuffle.
what
if
you
had
an
expert
witness
who
looked
at
the
gun
and
said
that's
just
physically
impossible.
the
gun
is
manufactured
in
way
it
cannot
go
off
unless
you
pull
the
trigger.
you
could
cross
examine
her
pretty
effectively,
couldn't
you?
even
though
she
appeared
to
be
absolutely
positive
that
this
happened
this
way.
it's
possible
that
there
are
times
you
can
evidence
that
just
snows
it's
a
lie.
justice
stevens
and
this
very
case
could
of
been
of
the
expert
who
subsequently
examined
the
gun
and
come
up
with
the
opposite
conclusion.
justice
stevens
i
presume
she
was
prepared
to
acknowledge
that.
that's
what
she
said,
she
didn't
pull
the
trigger.
justice
stevens
he's
not
terribly
generous
to
let
her
testify
to
that.
that's
certainly
clearly
admissible.
justice
stevens
you
may
not
believe
it,
but--
justice
stevens
--the
important
part
of
her,
what
she
wanted
to
testify
to
was
excluded
and
was
consistent
with
other
physical
evidence.
justice
stevens
xxx.
