let's
get
back
to
the
beginning.
what's
wrong
with
the
trial
court
saying
at
the
beginning
of
a
trial
that
no
evidence
as
a
result
of
any
intervention
by
a
hypnotic
source
will
be
admissible
period.
justice
marshall
not
in
this
case.
in
any
case.
justice
marshall
well,
will
you
go
back
to
my
question?
the
judge
says
apropos
of
nothing,
good
morning
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
i
will
not
listen
to
any
hypnotic
testimony,
or
testimony
the
result
of
hypnosis
from
any
witness
in
this
trial,
period.
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
marshall
why,
well
supposed
you
hook
it
up
with
the
exclusion
when
you
say
all
witnesses
shall
be
excluded.
and
in
addition
to
that
i
rule
this,
that
any
hypnosis
shall
not
be
testified
to.
justice
marshall
i
think
you're
real
argument
is
that
it
applies
to
you.
justice
marshall
but
it
was
given
before
the
judge?
justice
marshall
it
was
given.
the
judge
heard
the
testimony.
justice
marshall
what
happened
at
the
hearing?
justice
marshall
could
that
have
influenced
the
judgment.
justice
marshall
like
what?
what
was
misleading?
justice
marshall
it
was
in
your
opinion,
it
was
misleading.

justice
marshall
i
don't
think
you
can
speak
for
the
trial
judge.
xxx.
justice
marshall
what
would
you
do
if
an
unscrupulous
law
firm
assigned
one
of
its
unscrupulous
juniors
to
study
hypnosis
over
the
summer
and
he
graduated
from
the
hypnosis
school
and
didn't
tell
anybody
and
came
back
and
he
questioned
the
witness?
would
that
witness
be
thrown
out
under
your
xxx.
justice
marshall
why
not?
justice
marshall
well
how
many
years
does
he
have
to
go
to
qualify?
justice
marshall
well
if
he
goes--
justice
marshall
--as
many
years
as
this
person
did.
justice
marshall
this
hypnotist.
justice
marshall
uh-huh.
justice
marshall
well
then
why,
well
why
did
they
have
a
hearing?
justice
marshall
had
a
hearing
to
find
out
of
it
was
reliable.
justice
marshall
well
how
is
it
so
inherently
unreliable
that
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
to
find
out
if
it
is?
justice
marshall
it's
either
one
or
the
other.
justice
marshall
i
know
that.
justice
marshall
and
if
he
had
found
that
it
was
reliable,
he
would
of
let
it
in.
justice
marshall
well,
of
course
he
would
of.
he
would
have
been
reversed
by
the--
justice
marshall
--that's
not
certain
to
me.
i'm
not
certain.
justice
marshall
from
what
college
that
gives
a
ph.d.
in
hypnosis?
justice
marshall
well
you
said
she
had
a
ph.d.--
