mr.
james
m.
luffman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
frank
rock
died
on
july
2nd,
1983.
vickie
rock
maintains
that
his
death
was
caused
by
the
accidental
discharge
of
a
saturday
night
special
pistol
which
fired
when
her
husband
grabbed
her
hand.
he
was
attempting
to
prevent
her
from
leaving
the
house
to
get
a
hamburger.
the
pistol
was
in
her
hand,
she
maintains,
because
her
husband
had
become
suddenly
violent
striking
her
and
slamming
her
into
a
wall.
she
thought
it
would
keep
him
from
hitting
her
again.
vickie
rock
went
through
the
trauma
of
a
fruitless
wait
for
the
ambulance
she
called
and
watching
for
the
police
while
they
began
their
investigation
while
her
husband
lay
dying
on
the
floor.
she
was
taken
to
jail
before
the
ambulance
arrived
to
pick
up
her
unconscious
husband
and
she
learned
of
his
death
in
a
jail
cell.
the
evidence
is
that
only
frank
rock
and
vickie
rock
were
in
the
room
when
the
gun
discharged.
frank
rock
made
no
statement
to
the
police
before
his
death.
almost
a
year
later
on
june
25th,
1984,
vickie
rock
was
arraigned
on
a
charge
of
manslaughter
in
the
death
of
her
husband.
three
months
after
her
arraignment,
vickie
rock
was
still
unable
to
recall
some
of
the
detail
of
the
events
that
occurred
between
the
time
her
husband
slammed
her
against
the
wall
and
the
time
she
went
to
the
telephone
to
call
for
the
ambulance,
a
matter
of
seconds.
such
amnesia
is
apparently
not
unusual
for
persons
involved
in
violent
confrontations
but
in
her
case
it
was
not
complete.
she
remembered
a
great
deal
of
detail
from
both
before
the
gun
discharged
and
after.
the
record
does
not
reflect
what
other
methods
were
used
by
her
lawyer
to
attempt
to
refresh
her
recollection
of
those
violent
moments.
but
he
finally
employed
a
professional
psychologist
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
refresh
her
memory
with
the
use
of
hypnosis.
after
two
sessions
with
the
psychologist
she
was
able
to
recall
much
of
what
she
knew
but
had
forgotten.
the
most
important
thing
she
was
able
to
remember
was
that
she
never
pulled
the
trigger.
that
in
fact,
her
finger
was
outside
the
trigger
guard
when
the
pistol
discharged.
this
revelation
enabled
her
lawyer
to
employ
an
expert
gunsmith,
who
after
extensive
testing
of
the
weapon
was
able
to
testify
that
the
pistol
not
only
could
but
was
quite
likely
to
discharge
in
the
manner
related
by
petitioner,
something
that
had
previously
been
thought
to
be
impossible.
as
the
case
stood
at
this
point
a
clear
and
probably
close
jury
question
was
presented.
did
the
gun
discharge
by
accident
in
defect
in
design,
or
was
it
fired
by
petitioner
in
the
course
of
a
scuffle?
believing
vickie
rock's
testimony
the
jury
could
have
acquitted
her.
disbelieving
her
they
had
almost
no
alternative
but
to
convict.
the
jury
though
never
had
the
opportunity
to
make
that
choice.
vickie
rock's
testimony
about
what
happened
in
those
few
seconds
was
suppressed
by
a
pre-trial
order
which
limited
her
testimony
about
those
events
to
what
she
had
told
her
psychologist
prior
to
the
first
hypnotic
session.
that
order,
more
than
any
other
ruling,
took
the
decision
away
from
the
jury.
the
jury
was
left
with
the
mere
sign--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--she
proposed
to
testify
that
her
finger
was
not
on
the
trigger.
that--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--she
was
going--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--no,
sir.
she
was
going
to
testify
about
what
she
remembered
in
a
waking,
conscious
condition
after
two
sessions
with
a
psychologist
which
included
hypnosis.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
yes,
she
did.
and
did
not--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--she
remembers
some
of
what
occurred
during
the
hypnosis,
but
most
of
it
she
did
not.
the
key
point
of
her
testimony
she
did
not
recall
apparently
during
either
of
the
two
hypnotic
sessions.
apparently
it
was
after
she
came
out
of
hypnosis
that
she
was
able
to
recall
that
her
finger
was
outside
the
trigger
guard
and
that
she
didn't
fire
the
gun.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
no,
sir.
she
doesn't
try
to
explain
how
it
is
that
she
remembers
it,
but
she
claims
that
she
does
now
remember
it.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
the
jury
then
was
left
with
the
mere
scientific
probability
that
the
gun
could
have
discharged
by
accident
but
under
the
limiting
ruling
with
no
claim
by
the
petitioner
that
in
fact
it
did.
clearly
this
ruling
tipped
the
scale
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence
in
favor
of
the
state.
what
then
was
the
basis
for
that
ruling
that
insured
petitioner's
convictions?
a
ruling
in
the
face
of
the
state
constitutional
right
for
a
defendant
to
testify.
no
record
exists
of
the
hearing
on
which
the
order
was
based.
an
omission
that
seems
to
escape
notice
prior
to
these
proceedings,
leaving
what
is
stated
in
the
order
itself
as
the
only
basis
for
the
ruling.
that
the
testimonies
of
matters
recalled
by
petitioner
due
to
hypnosis
would
be
excluded
because
of
"inherent
unreliability
and
the
effect
of
hypnosis
in
eliminating
any
meaningful
cross
examination.
"
mr.
james
m.
luffman
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
yes,
ma'am,
i
do
so
long
as
that
ruling
is
not
extended
to
the
point
that
it
takes
what
should
be
properly
a
jury
question
away
from
a
jury.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
no,
not
because
the
court
makes
rulings
by
that.
i
think
it's
only
when
those
rulings
interfere
with
what
is
a
traditional
function
of
the
jury
to
determine
the
facts.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i
think
it
could.
i
don't
think
necessarily
on
the
facts
stated
that
it
does,
but
i
think
it
could
if
those
determinations
were
made
in
areas
that
when
the
case
is
looked
at
in
its
entirety
prevented
the
criminal
defendant
in
that
case
from
presenting
his
defense.
and
it--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
think
those
areas
fall
within
the
traditional
area
of
competency
of
a
witness.
in
other
words
that
the
witness
must
be
characterized
as
having
been
able
to
observe
the
events
that
he
relates
or
the
hearsay
rule
which
again,
with
certain
exceptions,
is
a
traditional
evidentiary
rule
in
our
system
to
keep
supposedly
unreliable
evidence
out.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i
believe
that's
in
a
different
category,
justice
scalia.
because
the
witness
is
not
physically
present,
or
physically
there,
nor
there
in
any
means
of,
by
any
scientific
observation
that
we
recognize
in
human
life
as
being
there.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i
think
a
judge
could
leave
it
to
a
jury.
i
think
he
could
leave
it
to
a
jury.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i
think
that
the
medium's
testimony
would
be
held
to
be
incompetent
and
i
think
would
be
properly
excludable.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--i
do
agree
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
make
that
decision
of
what
is
reliable
and
what
is
not
so
long
as
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
person's
constitutional
right
to
fairly
present
his
defense.
and
i
think
there
would
be
a
great
argument
of
difference
between
the
hypothetical
that
you
posed
just
basically
on
the
fact
that
in
our
case,
vickie
rock,
was
there.
she
was
physically
present.
she
was
in
the
room.
she
undoubtedly
saw
and
felt
what
happened
and
i
think
it's
certainly
arguable
that
the
medium
was
not
there
in
any
realistic
sense.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
yes,
your
honor,
there
was.
specifically
the
psychologist
made
a
tape
recording
of
both
sessions
with
vickie
rock
and
those
tape
recordings
were
played
at
the
pre-trial
hearing
for
the
trial
judge.
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
again
because
that
is
the
portion
of
the
record
that's
missing.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
no,
sir.
they
were
not.
they
were
played
only
for
the
trial
judge
prior
to
the
hearing.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
no,
sir.
it
was
an
audio
tape
only.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
dr.
back's
testimony
was
that
she
customarily
made
an
audio
recording
of
such
sessions.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
involving
hypnosis
and
a
number
of
articles
involving
hypnosis
where
the
strong
suggestion
is
made
for
the
use
of
video
tape.
but
it
was
not
used
in
this
case.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
no,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
haven't.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
we
do.
we've
cited
one
such
case
in
our
brief.
clines
v
state.
the
same
prosecuting
attorney
that
was
involved
in
this
case
took
two
eye
witnesses
to
a
murder
in
a
capital
murder
case
and
had
those
two
eyewitnesses
hypnotized.
that
hypnosis
was
not
disclosed
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
it
was
only
after
conviction
and
the
men
were
awarded
the
death
penalty
that
a
disclosure
was
made
that
two
of
the
eyewitnesses
had
been
hypnotized.
counsel
for
those
gentlemen
filed
a
motion
with
the
arkansas
supreme
court
asking
for
a
remand
of
that
case.
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
circuit
court
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
that
matter.
that
motion
was
dismissed
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court
without
opinion.
the
case
when
it
was
decided,
and
that
was
clines
v.
state,
made
no
mention
of
the
issue.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
it's
certainly
wasn't
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
well,
i
attempted
to,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
case,
what
we
were
trying
to
argue
that
in
the
context
of
was
the
fact
that
the
proceeding
as
a
whole
lacked
fairness.
and
we've
listed
that,
or
were
attempting
to
list
that
as
one
element
in
the
number
of
things
that
argued
that
it
lacked
fairness.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i
don't
dispute
that
the
arkansas
supreme
court
has
a
right
to
change
its
mind,
or
to
reach
any
decision
it
wants
to
when
the
case
is
properly
presented
to
them.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
that's
correct,
mr.--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice
scalia,
that's
why
i
noted
that
it
was
dismissed
without
opinion.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
well
except
in
reading
of
the
record,
to
read
the
indignation
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
when
the
prosecuting
attorney
objected
to
not
having
been
informed
until
the
last
minute
before
trial
of
the--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--xxx.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
no,
i'm
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
no,
i'm
not,
mr.
justice
scalia.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
there
is
no,
there
is
nothing--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--that
was
the
assumption.
but,
we
maintained
that
it
was
just
that.
it
was
just
an
assumption.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
either
in
the--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--the
trial
court
didn't
go
that
far.
the
trial
court
simply
made
his
order
saying
that
testimony
which
was
the
result
of
hypnosis
would
not
be
admissible.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
but,
his
step
by
step
ruling
are
the
only
indicators
of
what
apparently
the
trial
judge
thought
might
have
been
the
product
of
hypnosis
and
what
was
not.
but
there
were
three
qualifications
that
the
trial
judge
put
on
her
testimony.
number
one,
that
she
could
not
testify
to
matters
which
were
the
product
of
hypnosis;
or
secondly,
matters
which
had
not
been
stated
to
the
psychologist,
or
the
hypnotist
prior
to
the
hypnosis;
and
thirdly,
matters
which
were
the
product
of
post-hypnotic
suggestion.
in
the
rulings
of
the
trial
court
when
he
disallowed
various
pieces
of
testimony
there
was
no
attempt
made
by
the
trial
court
to
justify
under
which
provision
of
that
order
he
was
excluding
the
evidence.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
that's
a
deficiency
in
the
record,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
state
of
arkansas,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
also
did
not
have
available
to
it
when
it
made
its
decision
the
record
of
that
pre-trial
hearing
on
which
the
order
was
based.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
was
submitting
that
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
of
the
case
of
any
testimony
of
vickie
rock
that
was
inherently
unreliable,
or
that
can
be
seen
from
the
record
to
be
unreliable.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
because
we
maintain
she
was
not
permitted
to
testify
to
that
one
important
factor
that
was
virtually
her
only
claim
to
a
defense.
that
not
only
was
she
not
trying
to
fire
the
gun,
that
she
was
making
deliberate
effort
to
see
that
the
gun
didn't
fire.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
in
so
many--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
in
this
case--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--if
any
of
the
parties
to
the
trial
had
previously
undergone
hypnosis
and
that
was
the
basis,
and
what
was
learned
from
that
was
the
basis
of
their
defense,
or
the
basis
of
their
complaint,
and
was
the
only
basis,
we're
submitting
that
that
is
a
better
question
for
a
jury
than
for
a
judge.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i
think
it's
much
too
broad,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
believe
that
it's
so
broad
that
it
eliminates
cases
like
this
where
the
defendant
depends
on
that
particular
piece
of
evidence
virtually
for
her
entire
defense
and--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--my
argument
again
is
that
it's
just
much
too
broad.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
if
it
applies
to
a
defendant
whose
only
means
of
saying
her
defense
is
from
that
testimony
which
was
the
product
of
that,
then
i
think
it
can
be
applied
in
an
unconstitutional
way.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i
think--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--there
are
degrees,
of
course,
of
unreliability.
but
i
think
if
once
it's
classified
as
unreliable,
i
think
that
was
true
in
the
chambers
case,
hearsay
evidence
was
kept
out
because
it
was
thought
to
be,
because
hearsay
is
generally
thought
to
be
unreliable.
yet,
the
categorization
of
all
of
the
combination
of
rulings
by
the
trial
court
were
held
to
have
been
applied
in
such
a
way
that
even
though
the
individual
evidentiary
rules
themselves
may
have
been
constitutional
that
the
cumulative
effect
of
them
when
they
prevented
the
defendant
from
presenting
his
defense
was
to
deny
him
due
process
of
law
and
that's
what
we're
arguing
for
mrs.
rock.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
the
prosecuting
attorney
was
advised
of
such
by
the
defense
counsel
when
they
were
exchanging
lists
of
witnesses.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
and
the
defense
counsel
listed
as
a
witness,
dr.
betty
back,
who
was
the
hypnotist.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
she
testified
at
the
pre-trial
hearing--
mr.
james
m.
luffman
--not
at
the
trial.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
that's
correct,
sir.
we
would
submit
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
distinguish
this
problem
from
the
problem
of
a
witness
who
refreshes
his
recollection
by
referring
to
notes
or
a
written
document
and
then
adopts
the
version
of
those
facts
for
his
testimony.
he
may
become
difficult
to
cross
examine,
but
it
has
never
been
suggested
that
a
witness
who
so
refreshes
his
recollection
not
be
allowed
to
testify.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
scalia,
because
the
cross
examination
and
demeanor
of
the
witness
is
not
the
only
way
to
impeach
his
testimony.
there
are
many
other
ways
to
do
it
and
any
skilled
trial
attorney,
i
would
submit,
could
cross
examine
such
a
witness
by
establishing
a
great
amount
of
detail,
some
of
which
is
undoubtedly
going
to
be
provably
false.
there
are
just
any
number
of
ways
for
a
competent
trial
attorney
to
discredit
witnesses.
and
the
argument
that
this
leaves
defendant
not
subject
to
cross
examination
suggests,
in
effect,
that
there
is
no
other
way
to
get
at
the
truthfulness
of
the
witness's
testimony
and
we
submit
that
there
are.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
not
necessarily,
i
think
it
could
be.
but,
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessarily
so
that
it
could.
thank
you.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
not
at
all
enough
familiar
with
the
process
to
say
unequivocally
what
hypnosis
is
in
the
sense
that
i
can
testify
to
it
from
personal
experience,
but
i
know
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
looking
at
it
from
the
legal
process
that
i
see
little
difference
in
that
process
and
the
process
of
a
lawyer
going
over
and
over
and
over
a
story
with
the
witness,
which
any
good
lawyer
does,
in
preparation
for
trial
so
he'll
be
able
to
withstand
cross
examination.
i'm
not
even
sure
that
i
can
see
the
difference
if
the
witness
listened
to
his
own
story
on
tape
at
night
while
he's
asleep.
the
ultimate
issue,
i
think,
here
is
that
jury
question
issue
and
that
is
whether
this
case
is
going
to
stand
as
the
first
case
in
recent
legal
history
where
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
who
was
an
eyewitness
to
the
alleged
crime
was
not
allowed
to
tell
the
jury
what
happened
according
to
her
own
present
waking
memory.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
i
think
the
answer
is
a
combination
of
two
cases,
first
nix
v.
whiteside
as
i
understand
it
says
that
certainly
the
right
to
testify
is
now
a
fourteenth
amendment
right.
mr.
james
m.
luffman
it's
assumed
to
be.
and
i
would
apply
to
that,
you
know,
to
that
question
the
chambers
reasoning
that
where
the
state
evidentiary
rules
or,
even
though
there
may
be
good
reason
for
them,
when
they
are
applied
in
such
a
way
so
that
a
criminal
defendant
does
not
have
that
fundamental
right
of
fairness
to
tell
his
story
to
the
jury
then
due
process
is
violated.
because
two
things,
number
one,
the
inherent
value
on
allowing
an
individual
accused
of
a
crime
to
tell
his
story
and
number
two,
the
traditional
function
as
between
the
judge
and
the
jury.
and
that
determination
of
reliability
and
inherent
worth
of
the
testimony
is
historically
and
traditionally
the
function
of
the
jury
and
i
think
properly
so.
thank
you.
