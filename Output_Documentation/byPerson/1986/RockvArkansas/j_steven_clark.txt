mr.
j.
steven
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
issue
clearly
here
presented
to
you
today
is
whether
this
hypnotically
refreshed
testimony
is
so
inherently
unreliable
that
the
state
of
arkansas
may,
consistent
with
the
united
states
constitution,
exclude
that
testimony
when
it's
offered
by
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case.
the
answer
to
that
question,
i
submit
to
this
court
is
yes,
and
further
that
the
state
of
arkansas
can
properly
fashion
its
own
rules
of
evidence
if
they
do
not
violate
fundamental
constitutional
safeguards.
and
the
arkansas
rule
does
not.
although
hypnosis
has
been
accepted
clearly
as
an
aid
in
therapy,
it's
validity
as
a
means
of
enhancing
or
refreshing
memory
has
been
challenged
repeatedly.
hypnosis
creates
within
the
subject
a
hyper
state
of
suggestibility,
lowered
critical
reasoning,
the
potential
for
altered
memory,--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
in
reviewing
this
testimony
had
it
applied
the
frye
test
for
instance,
in
terms
of
generally
accepted
by
the
scientific
community
as
a
procedure
that
is
advanced
as
being
legitimate.
said
if
you'd
applied
the
frye
test
under
the
testimony
submitted
with
the
experts
of
orrin
and
diamond
and
others
would
not
have
admitted
this
testimony
because
it
was
not
generally
accepted
by
a
scientific
community
as
being
reliable
and
credible.
and
so
i
submit
to
you
in
this
instance
that
the
court,
though
not
applying
that
rule
is
my
contention
to
this
court,
said
it
could
have
or
even
a
lesser
standard
and
still
would
have
excluded
this
testimony
because
of
its
inherent
unreliability.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor,
the
prosecutor,
in
fact
in
the
cline
case
did
attempt
to
hypnotize
two
witnesses.
one
which
was
unable
to
be
hypnotized.
the
other
which
was
hypnotized
did
not
recall
anything
under
hypnosis
other
than
what
they
had
recalled
prior
to
that.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
however,
has
never
ruled
on
this
issue
until
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
footnote
since
this
was
raised
by
petitioner
i
went
back
to
check.
in
that
cline
case,
counsel,
an
associate
of
mr.
putman,
defense
counsel
in
this
instance
until
he
died,
participated
in
that
case
and
if
the
petitioner
had
thought
that
that
was
an
improper
application
could
have
raised
that
issue
at
trial
and
did
not
or
with
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
that's
procedurally
barred
in
the
sense
that
they
bring
it
to
this
court
now.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
mr.
putman's
associate,
a
young
woman
by
the
name
of
priscilla
kay
pope
participated
in
the
trial
of
cline
and
orendorf
and
i
assume
as
an
associate
in
a
small
law
firm
in
arkansas,
who
participated
in
this,
had
knowledge
of
it,
in
fact
filed
the
petition
with
the
court
prior
to
this
decision,
transferred
that
information
and
could
have
well
raised
it
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
although--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor,
there
were
two
hypnotic
trances
in
this.
in
the
first
trance,
the
psycho
psychologist,
ms.
back,
dr.
back,
never
mentioned
the
question
of
whether
the
gun
had
been
cocked.
in
our
joint
appendix
on
page
95
in
a
second
hypnotic
trance
she
indicated
that
she
asked
these
series
of
questions.
five,
i
believe,
to
be
specific
about
the
gun
itself
and
did
ms.
rock
recall
any
of
these
instances.
one
of
the
answers
is
that
ms.
rock
recalled
putting
her
thumb
on
the
hammer
to
cock
the
weapon.
this
was
a
double
action
weapon.
you
had
to
cock
it
and
then
pull
the
trigger
to
make
it
fire.
there
was
a
great
deal
of,
on
cross
examination
the
prosecutor
tried
to
make
a
big
issue
of
the
fact
that
were
these
leading
questions
getting
ms.
rock
to
remember
a
combination
of
fact
and
fiction.
the
phenomenon
called
confabulation
to
resolve
herself
from
responsibility
in
this
instance.
now
we
submit
to
the
court
that
that
in
fact
occurred.
although
that
testimony
was
never
given
at
the
trial,
it
was
proffered,
but
she
never
was
allowed
to
testify.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
proffered.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
heard
the
testimony.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
he
heard
the
tapes.
yes,
your
honor,
what
happened
is
here.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
think
it
influenced
the
judge's
decision
in
the
sense
that
he
felt
this
testimony
was
so
inherently
unreliable
that
its
probative
value
was
outweighed
by
its
ability
to
mislead
or
confuse--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--well
in
the
second
instance,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
it
was
in
the
opinion
of
the
trial
judge
and
i
certainly
concur
with
that.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
and
the
arkansas
supreme
court--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
has
ruled
per
se
that
this
testimony
is
inadmissible
because
of
its
inherent--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--unreliable.
basically
i
think,
your
honor,
because
the
arkansas
supreme
court
has
found
that
when
you
rely
upon
hypnosis
that
a
judicial
proceeding
ceases
to
be
a
judicial
proceeding
because
you're
calling
on
the
trier
of
fact,
in
this
instance,
the
jury
to
reach
its
judgment
not
based
on
logical
inference
from
the
facts
and
the
evidence
deduced,
but
to
reach
its
judgment
simply
on
guess
work.
as
justice
scalia
questioned
a
moment
ago,
we
cannot
have
a,
by
constitutional
bar,
the
judge
comment
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
but
if
they
could
the
instruction
it
seems
to
me
would
be
something
like
this:
this
witness
has
been
hypnotized,
the
more
convincing
they
sound
it
may
be
in
fact
that
they're
not
convincing,
that
they
really
don't
know
what
they're
saying
is
being
the
separate--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--well
then--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
the
problem
with
that
simply
is,
is
that
in
terms
of
the
rules
of
evidence
that
arkansas,
i
submit
this
court
can
fashion
you
want
to
have
a
judicial
proceeding
that
is
fundamentally
sound
in
the
sense
that
you
allow
that
trier
of
fact
to
judge
the
witness
on
their
manifestations
and
indicia
of
outward
concern,
their
testimony
and
you
don't
resolve
that
issue
to
a
battle
of
experts.
you
simply
see
who
has
the
most
and
add
them
up.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
certainly,
your
honor,
you
permit
expert
testimony
to
talk
about
reliability,
but
not
to
comment
on
the
ultimate
and
the
final
outcome
of
the
issue
at
hand.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
instance
that
the
phenomenon
called
confabulation,
mixing
fact
and
fiction.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
what
mrs.
rock
did
in
terms
of
confabulation
through
the
two
hypnotic
trances
was
to
find
a
way
to
escape
two
types
of
prison.
the
actual
prison
which
she
now
is
facing
and
secondly
that
prison
in
terms
of
her
own
moral
guilt
with
having
been
involved
in
the
shooting
of
her
husband.
she
was
trying
because
of
hyper
suggestibility
to
find
acceptance
to
relieve
herself
of
that
moral
doubt
and
guilt
and
to
say,
and
respond
in
a
positive
manner
to
the
questions
imposed
by
the
hypnotist.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
only
know
this
in
the
instance
that,
of
course
i've
read
the
proffered
testimony,
but
in
the
instance
of
the
scientific
comments
on
expert,
or
hypnosis
and
its
effect
on
an
individual
is
that
the
weight
of
scientific
authority
and
the
reason
that
the
scientific
community
has
rejected
this
as
a
generally
accepted
standard
is
that
it
is
unreliable
because
you
lower
critical
judgment.
people
then
accept;
they
don't
question.
you
put
them
in
a
state
of
hyper
acceptance
so
that
they
want
to
find
an
answer
with
a
combination
of
fact
and
fiction
to
fantasize
even
as
much
to
get
to
the
desired
answer
and
that
in
terms
of
a
judicial
proceeding
that
we
have
no
way,
we,
being
any
attorney,
whether
it's
a
criminal
action
or
a
civil
action,
of
going
to
the
core
of
the
credibility
of
that
witness
because
the
witness
coming
out
of
the
hypnosis
and
the
post
hypnotic
state
believes
absolutely
to
a
moral
certainty
it's
right.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
think
the
experts
tend
to
believe
that
what
is
remembered
post
hypnotic,
that
person
believes
to
a
moral
certainty
that
that
is
accuracy.
that
is,
whether
it
is
a
combination
of
fact
or
fiction
is
not
the
issue
and
that
it
could
not
be
rebutted
by
traditional
means.
if
you
said
to
a
witness,
did
you
have
a
meeting
on
friday
the
18th
and
the
witness
said:
no.
you
say,
well
i
show
you
your
diary.
it
says
friday
the
18th,
scheduled
meeting
with.
you
say
well
at
the
result
of
hypnosis
and
the
confabulation,
you
say,
i'm
sorry
it
was
the
19th.
well,
i
show
you
a
letter
saying
the
meeting
was
scheduled
for
the
18th?
was
in
fact
the
meeting
on
the
18th?
no
it
was
on
the
19th.
the
letter
may
have
said
it
was
on
the
18th,
the
diary
may
say
it
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
18th,
but
it
wasn't,
it
was
on
the
19th.
completely
unshakable
testimony
and
that
is
inherently
unreliable.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
in
this
very
case
it
assisted
mrs.
rock
in
her
defense.
she
could
not,
in
the
second
hypnotic
trance
she
remembered
that
her
finger
was
extended
along
the
gun.
she
also
remembered
that
she
put
her
thumb
on
the
hammer
to
cock
it.
because
of
that,
counsel
for
the
defense
went
out
and
found
a
gun
expert
who
testified
that
in
fact
this
gun
could
have
discharged
because
of
a--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor
it
is
possible.
the
problem
for
us
is
that
the
fact
finder
doesn't
know
what
is
faction
in
truth
and
you're
making
them
guess.
and
that
should
not
be
the
basis
of
judicial
proceeding
where
you
simply
have
to
try
to
guess
when
the
witness
himself
is
convinced
to
an
absolute
certainty
that
what
they've
testified
to
is--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
those
drugs
are,
i
think,
sodium
ambithal
and
sodium
pentothal
and
others.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
think
the
court
could
exclude
that.
in
arkansas,
a
court
using
our
uniform
rules
of
evidence,
section
403
which
is
very
similar
to
the,
identical,
excuse,
to
the
federal
rule
to
determine
that
that
information,
even
though
with
proper
value
and
even
though
relevant,
was
confusing,
misleading
or
unduly
prejudicial
and
could
exclude
it.
i
think
that's
within
the
discretion
of
our
rules
of
evidence
that
this
state
can
apply.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
we
have
a
flat
rule
of
inadmissible
per
se.
yes,
your
honor,
for
that
part
of
the
memory
that
was
not
proven
before
or--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--shown
to
have
been
known
before
the
hypnotic
trance.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
well,
your
honor,
we
are
going
to
be
of
course,
in
a
situation
of
jeopardy
if
defense
counsel
just
is
unscrupulous
and
does
not
disclose.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
simply
all
we
could
do
in
this
instance,
your
honor,
if
it
was
hidden
from
the
state,
or
hidden
from
a
party
in
this
proceeding,
that
if
some
point,
if
discovered--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--raise
that
issue
in
terms
of
appellate
relief.
in
the
instance
of
the
arkansas
rule
it
is
clear
that
the
arkansas
court
did
not
say
that
hypnotically
refreshed
witness
could
not
testify.
that's
not
what
the
court
held.
it
held
that
the
witness
could
testify
but
was,
and
did
not
prohibit
that,
only
could
not
testify
to
that
portion
of
the
testimony
hypnotically
refreshed.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
well,
your
honor,--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--in
this
specific
case
and
in
the
instance
of
what
mrs.
rock
told
the
hypnotist
in
terms
of
the
pre-hypnosis
notes
and
there
were
some
handwritten
notes
in
complete
sentences.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
under
the
arkansas
rule,
your
honor,--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--xxx
would
not
be
able
to
testify
to
anything
that
was
a
product
of
that
hypnosis.
yes,
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
that's
an
unfair
or
violent--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--no,
your
honor,
i
submit--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--that
if
you
could
indicate
to
evidence
or
this
that
were
outside
the
subject
of
the
hypnosis
you
certainly
are
permissible
and
permitted
and
can
testify
to
that,
your
honor.
so
if
it
was
the
events
of
how
the
gun
was
discharged,
but
what
else
happened
in
your
marriage,
what
was
the
your
relationship--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--with
your
husband,
those
things
you
could.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
arkansas
rule
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
unconstitutional
xxx.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
witness
would
be
thrown
out
for
the
fact
that--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--simply
the
fact
that
one
has
studied
hypnosis,
has
graduated
from
hypnosis
school
as
your
hypothetical
suggests,
your
honor,
does
not
move
to
the
decision
of
the
arkansas
rule
of
evidence
and
that
is
that
when
one--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
that's
the
problem
with
this
hypnosis
itself.
i
don't
know.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
comedians,
dentists,
lawyers,
anyone
can
do
hypnosis.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor?
mr.
j.
steven
clark
in
the
instance
that
this
person,
this
was
a
trained
psycho
psychologist
who
had
advanced
degrees,
so
had
a
baccalaureate
degree
and
an
advanced
degree.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
but
hypnosis
is
not
a
method
that
you
have
to
have
formal
training
to
be
able
to
apply.
and
that's
what
the
arkansas
court
found
so
inherently
unreliable
about
this,
your
honor,
is
that
if
it
could
be
applied
by
anyone--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--had
a
hearing,
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
instance--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
well
in
this
instance
i--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--in
this
instance,
in
this
rock
case,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
what
happened
was
that
when
mr.
putman,
defense
counsel,
gave
the
list
of
his
witnesses
which
included
dr.
back,
the
first
time--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--the
prosecution
had
notice
they
asked
for
a
hearing
to
have
that
testimony
excluded.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
submit,
your
honor,
yes
he
would
have,
but
he
did
not.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
he
would
have
been
reversed
by
the
arkansas
court,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
think
the
rule
has
been
applied
by
the
arkansas
court
is
one
that
is
applied
so
that
juries
can
reach
verdicts
on
the
basis
of
logical
inference
and
not
guess
work.
hypnotically
refreshed
testimony
is
not
akin
to
those
other
methods
of
refreshing
memory.
for
such
hypnotically
enhanced
or
refreshed
recollection
does
blight
cross
examination
i
say
to
this
court.
it
does
so
by
producing
in
that
witness
that
absolute,
firm
belief
to
a
moral
certainty
that
everything
they
have
recollected
is
absolutely
fact.
whether
it
is
fact
or
fiction,
or
some
fact,
some
fiction,
or
a
fantasized
result
of
a
combination
of
all
that.
and
that
literally
what
that
produces
is
a
situation
where
the
trier
of
fact
in
any
proceeding
cannot
use
the
objective
indicia
or
manifestation
of
the
credibility
of
a
witness;
that
they
would
really
have
to
try
to
guess
what's
in
that
witness's
mind
and
whether
that
witness
in
fact
knows
what's
in
that
witness's
mind.
and
that
is
not
the
underpinnings
of
what
i
submit
to
this
court
is
the
truth
finding
function
in
a
jury
system
or
in
any
judicial
process.
due
process
of
the
law
does
not
give
any
witness
a
license
to
lie
or
to
throw
any
and
everything
into
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
unlike
the--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
contention
that
this
was
a
lie,
but
i
simply
say
that
the
due
process
of
the
law
does
not
require
that
you
put
any
witness
on
and
let
them
deliberately
lie
or
let
them
throw
anything
that
they
just
happen
to
feel
might
have
some
bearing
on
the
case
in
the
case.
and
that
the
arkansas
rule
that
excludes
that,
403,
on
the
probative
value
versus
the
potential
for
confusion,
misleading,
is
one
that's
a
weighing
test
that
can
be
fairly
applied
and
it's
a
rule
that
arkansas
can
articulate
and
one
that
is
within
the
residual
power
of
the
state
to
set
in
terms
of
its
rules
of
evidence
is
applied.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
it
could
be
grist
for
a
jury
argument
and
i
submit
that
in
fact
that's
what
petitioner
would
like
for
us
to
say,
except
that,
constitutionally
in
arkansas
we're
barred
from
giving
instruction
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
the
credibility
of
the
witness,
and
secondly,
in
any
judicial
proceeding
where
you
put
counsel,
a
civil
or
criminal
matter
where
they
cannot
effectively
cross
examine
a
witness
and
put
them
in
the
trier
of
fact
that
guess
work,
i
submit
that
you
don't
have
a
judicial
proceeding
at
that
point
any
longer.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
xxx.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
but
in
this
very
case,
the
testimony
that
was
excluded
i
think
was
equally
as
beneficial
to
the
state
as
it
was
the
defendant.
there
never
was
any
testimony
entered
into
the
record
that
her
thumb
was
on
the
hammer
to
cock
it.
that
is,
at
least
the
state
could
have
used
as
some
evidence
of
intent.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
the
problem
is,
your
honor,
she
doesn't
really
know.
and
in
the
instance
of
what
actually
happened
here,
if
the
court
made
error
and
i
submit
they
did
not,
but
if
they
did
i
believe
it
was
harmless
error
in
the
instance
that
mrs.
rock,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
105
and
107,
the
trial
judge
who's
a
veteran
trial
judge
for
some
twenty
years
faced
with
a
complicated
issue,
did
everything
possible
to
give
her
latitude
to
give
live
testimony
her
own.
he
didn't
rely
on
other
witnesses.
he
allowed
mrs.
rock
to
testify.
she
said
in
response
to
questions
from
her
counsel
which
were
these:
"did
you
intend
to
kill
your
husband?
"
"no,
i
loved
him,
i
would
not
shoot
him.
"
"did
you
ever
point
the
gun
at
him?
"
"no".
there
was
ample
evidence
in
the
record
that
it
was
an
accident.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
but
she
was
not
in
the
instance--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
disqualified
as
a
witness
to
participate
in
her
own
defense.
and
that's
what
i'm
simply
saying
to
you
is
that
the
xxx.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
well
arguably
consistent,
your
honor,
with
other
physical
evidence.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
the
experts
say
it's
possible
that,
under
your
hypothetical
it
would
be
a
different
situation,
of
course.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
now,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--i
would
submit
that
your
hypothetical
is
inconsistent
with
this
case
but
in
response
to
your
hypothetical,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--i
don't
think
she
independently
could
remember
that
her
finger
was
extended
along
the
side
of
the
weapon.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
but,
her
post
hypnotic
recollection,
i
submit
to
the
court
was
enhanced
and
may
be
the
direct
result
of
fabrication.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
but
she
doesn't
know
the
difference
i
submit
to
this
court,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
what
she
did
know
pre-hypnosis
and
post
hypnosis.
in
the
first
hypnotic
trance,
your
honor,
she
was
asked
what
she
saw.
she
never
remembered
a
specific
at
all
about
the
gun
or
her
position
of
her
hand
on
the
gun.
in
the
second
trance,
your
honor,
after
five
questions
from
the
hypnotist.
five
questions
about
the
gun,
the
location
of
her
hand
on
the
gun,
was
her
thumb
on
the
trigger?
where
was
her
finger?
you
have
a
situation
where
the
hypnotist
is
inducing
a
response.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
point
i
make
to
this
court
is
that--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
she
remembered
all
of
what
she
said
during
hypnosis.
i
think
that's
correct.
the
point
i
try
to
make
to
this
court
is
that
what
she
remembered
post
hypnosis
she
cannot
separate
fact
from
fiction.
that
which
was
suggested
and
she
accepted
the
suggestion
as
a
result
of
the
hypnosis.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
only
know
that,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
the
process
called
hypnosis
leads
an
individual
and
it's
in
varying
degrees,
your
honor,
to
suggestibility,
to
lowered
critical
reasoning
and
judgment,
to
a
willingness
to
try
to
find
acceptance
to
respond
in
the
affirmative
acceptance
answer
to
the
questions
that
are
asked
and
that
because
of
that
what
we
simply
know
is
we
don't
know
what
mrs.
rock
really
knew
or
what
she
responded
in
trying,
as
i
said
earlier,
to
escape
from
two
kinds
of
prisons.
xxx.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
have
not.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
she
was.
a
ph.d.--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
would
apologize
to
the
court.
that
was
not
the
intent
at
all.
she
was
a
ph.
d,
psycho
psychologist.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
would
have
to
plead
ignorant
to
what
is
a
psycho
psychologist,
your
honor,
and
could
not
find
a
clear
definition
xxx.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
do
not
know,
your
honor,
xxx.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
her
ph.d.
is
in
psychology
not
in
hypnosis,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
oh
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
there
are
lots
of
individuals--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--including
many
psychologists
who
can
do
that.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
too.
in
the
instant
case,
i
submit
to
this
court,
the
petitioner
was
not
denied
any
due
process
by
the
exclusion
of
this
hypnotically
enhanced
testimony.
since
this
veteran
trial
judge,
as
i
stated,
did
show
great
deference
and
latitude
to
mrs.
rock,
in
allowing
her
to
participate
in
her
own
defense
through
her
live
testimony,
this
case
is
simply
one
where
the
arkansas
court
has
properly
applied
a
rule
to
fundamentally
insure
in
arkansas
and
protect
that
truth
finding
function
of
the
jury
and
thereby
enable
the
jury
to
make
decisions
rationally
and
not
based
on
guess
work
and
that
rule,
i
submit
does
not
offend
any
section
or
provision
of
the
constitution,
or
any
of
those
protected
safeguards
afforded
a
criminal
defendant.
and
for
that
reason,
the
arkansas
rule
and
the
arkansas
decision
should
be
affirmed.
