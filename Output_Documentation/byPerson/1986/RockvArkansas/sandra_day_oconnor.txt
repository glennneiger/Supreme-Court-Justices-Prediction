justice
o'connor
mr.
luffman,--
--xxx.
go
ahead.
justice
o'connor
do
you
acknowledge
that
arkansas
or
any
state
does
have
a
right
at
trial
to
exclude
inherently
unreliable
testimony
whether
it
comes
from
the
defendant
or
a
witness
called
by
the
defendant?
justice
o'connor
well,
presumably
most
states
take
the
position
that
the
trial
judge
may
exclude
altogether
from
evidence
certain
types
of
evidence.
application
of
the
hearsay
rule
at
times
or
other
evidence
which
the
court
determines
is
inherently
unreliable.
for
example
at
times,
polygraph
evidence--
justice
o'connor
--and
that
doesn't
violate
a
constitutional
right
because
the
court
makes
rulings
like
that
does
it?
justice
o'connor
well
but
it's
a
traditional
function
of
the
court
to
keep
out
certain
types
of
unreliable
evidence.
now
what
if
instead
of
a
per
se
rule
against
hypnotically
induced
testimony,
what
if
the
court
examined
in
camera
or
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
the
background
of
particular
hypnotic
evidence
and
determined
that
it
was
just
unreliable.
and
so
unreliable
that
it
shouldn't
come
in.
does
that
violate
anybody's
constitutional
rights?
justice
o'connor
well
it
might
very
well
if
the
court
concluded
that
the
background
was
such
that
it
was
in
fact
totally
unreliable.
supposing
in
this
case
you'd
had
three
witnesses
for
the
defense,
all
of
whom
were
going
to
offer
to
testify
that
she
had
her
hand
outside
the
trigger
guard
and
on
voir
dire
it
turned
out
that
none
of
them
were
in
the
room
at
the
time.
and
the
trial
court
says,
well
these
people
had
no
opportunity
to
observe.
their
testimony
is
utterly
unreliable
and
i'm
going
to
exclude
it.
does
that
violate
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights?
