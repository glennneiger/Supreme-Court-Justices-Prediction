what
was
it
she
was
proposed
to
testify
about?
justice
white
was
she
going
to
testify
about
what
she
remembered
under
his
hypnosis.
what
she
said--
justice
white
--she
was
going
to
testify
what
her
answers
were
while
she
was
hypnotized?
justice
white
well
didn't
she
make
some
responses
during
hypnosis?
justice
white
and
she
remembered
making
them
afterwards
or
does
she
claim
that
those
were
her
independent
recollections
afterwards?
justice
white
so
she
says
that
something
happened
to
me
during
hypnosis
that
made
me
later
remember
it.
justice
white
but
after
hypnosis
she
remembered
it,
whereas
she
didn't
before?
justice
white
xxx
case
that
there's
no,
that
the
record
doesn't
indicate
sufficiently
that
her
testimony
after
hypnosis
was
caused
by
the
hypnosis.
justice
white
so
as
the
case
comes
to
us
from
reading
the
opinions
and
what
not,
that
it
seems
assumed
that
what
she
was
testifying
to
was
caused
by
the
hypnosis.
justice
white
--well,
but
the
courts
below
thought
it
was,
didn't
they?
are
we
supposed
to
decide
that
factual
issue?
justice
white
well
he
wouldn't
let
her
testify.
justice
white
which
meant
that
he
had
to
think
that
this
was
caused
by
hypnosis.

on
reliability
and
depending
on
what
the
jury,
which
expert
the
jury
believed.
justice
white
in
criminal
trials
and
a
lot
of
other
trials
people,
the
courts
permit
the
calling
of
psychologists
to
talk
about
eyewitness
testimony,
its
reliability
or
its
unreliability.
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but
that's
the
issue
here.
the
court
said
we
exclude
this
because
it's
inherently
unreliable.
justice
white
mr.
attorney
general,
i
thought
that
this
lady
purported
to
testify,
wanted
to
testify
to
what
she
now
said
she
independently
recollects.
that
it's
just
as
though
there
had
never
been
any
hypnosis.
i
remember
this
now.
this
is,
my
finger
was
here.
and
if
that's
the
case,
i
don't
see
what
interference
there
is
with
cross
examination
anymore
than
there
would
be
in
the
usual
case.
she
says,
i
do
remember
it
now.
i
didn't
use
to
remember
it,
but
my
memory's
been
refreshed
somehow.
justice
white
but
i
remember
it
now
and
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story,
mr.
prosecutor.
justice
white
why
is
it
inconsistent?
justice
white
i
asked
the
counsel
as
to
what
she
purported
to
testify
to
and
he
says
it's
her
independent
recollection,
post
hypnotic
recollection.
justice
white
that
may
be.
that
may
be,
but
she
claims
that
she
now
recollects
it.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
there
was
no
testimony,
she
wasn't
purporting
to
testify
to
what
she
said
during
hypnosis.
she
was
purporting
to
testify
to
what
she
now
remembered.
justice
white
she
didn't
even
remember
what
she
said
during
hypnosis,
did
she?
justice
white
well
how
do
you
know
that?
