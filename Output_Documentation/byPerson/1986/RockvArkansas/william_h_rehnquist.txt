chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
86-130,
vickie
lorene
rock
v.
arkansas.
mr.
luffman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
arguing
that
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
isn't
sauce
for
the
gander
in
arkansas
under
this
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
you
haven't
made
that
argument
anywhere
in
your
brief
i
don't
think,
have
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
on
the
first
page
of
its
opinion,
appendix
a
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
says
that
the
trial
court
ruled
testimony
of
matters
recalled
by
appellant
due
to
hypnosis
inadmissible
because
of
its
unreliability
and
because
of
the
effect
of
hypnosis
on
cross,
appellant
was
allowed
to
testify
about
things
she
remembered
prior
to
being
subjected
to
hypnosis
though
testimony
resulting
from
post
hypnotic
suggestion
was
excluded.
we
believe
the
trial
court's
ruling
was
correct.
certainly
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
thought
that
the
trial
court
had
ruled
that
testimony
not
affected
by
the
hypnotic
suggestion
could
come
in.
testimony
that
was
induced
by
the
hypnotic
suggestion
would
be
kept
out.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we're
basically
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas.
we
don't
ordinarily
make
independent
factual
findings
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
advance
your
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
saying--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--whether
or
not
that
testimony
was
caused
by
hypnotically
induced
recollection,
it
should
have
been
allowed
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
agree
then
that
getting
at
it
by
demeanor
testimony
would
be
ruled
out
in
this
situation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
now,
why
should
we
take
your
word
for
all
of
this,
general
clark?
i
mean,
you
don't
have
any
degrees
on
the
subject,
i
take
it,
and
we
don't
either.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
this?
how
do
you
know
it,
what
you've
just
been
saying.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
these
experts
say
that
every
single
witness
coming
out
of
a
hypnotic
state
is
this
way?
or
do
they
just
say
there
is
this
possibility,
or
this
potential
some
of
them
will?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
clark.
mr.
luffman,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
luffman.
the
case
is
submitted.
