justice
scalia
well
what
about
somebody
who
claims
to
have
observed
it?
let's
assume
that
the
defense
hires
a
medium
who
hurls
herself
back
to
the
time
and
sees
the
murder
and
she
wants
to
testify
that
in
her
trance
she
saw
your
client
with
her
finger
on
the
trigger
guard
and
not
on
the
trigger.
could
that
be
excluded?
the
witness
claims
to
have
seen
it.
yes,
i
was
in
a
trance
and
i
saw
it.
now,
does
the
court
have
to
leave
that
to
the
jury
to
decide
whether
in
fact
the
medium
saw
that
or
not?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
what
you
say.
i
mean
some
people
believe
in
those
things.
why
can't
we
leave
that
to
the
jury?
if
you
get
a
jury
that
believes
that
this
person
really
has
those
powers.
justice
scalia
that's
not
the
question.
suppose
the
judge
took
it
away?
would
you
just
say
that
that's
a
matter
that
the
state
can
do
even
though
in
that
case
you
have
a
much
more
explicit
constitutional
right
that
is
set
forth
in
so
many
words
to
call
witnesses
in
your
defense.
whereas
you're
relying
on
a
constitutional
right
that
doesn't
really
appear
in
the
constitution,
does
it?
i...
to
testify
in
your
own
behalf?
justice
scalia
well
i
don't
see
much
difference
between
that
and
your
case
except
you
know,
it's
a
matter
of
argument
what's
reliable
and
what's
not
reliable.
you're
acknowledging
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
make
a
reasonable
judgment
about
what
is
reliable
and
not
reliable
and
here
they've
said
there's
no
way
we
can
be
sure
what
she
testifies
to
after
hypnosis
is,
there's
no
way
she
herself
can
be
sure.
justice
scalia
what
of
it
is
suggestion
and
what
isn't?
justice
scalia
mr.
luffman,--
justice
scalia
--well
we
don't
know
the
basis
for
the
arkansas
supreme
court's
opinion.
i
mean,--
justice
scalia
--we
don't
know
that
it's
lawful
in
arkansas
to
allow
hypnotized
witnesses
except
for
the
defendant
himself.
we
don't
know
that.
it
may
have
been
dismissed
because
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
to
raise
the
issue
earlier
and
it
had
not
been
presented
properly.
or
we
don't
know
what
the
reason
is
do
we?
justice
scalia
so
it
really
isn't
a
sauce
for
the
goose,
sauce
for
the
gander
proposition
we
have
in
front
of
us.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
but
you're
not
asking
us
to
censor
the
prosecutor.
justice
scalia
you're
asking
us
to
strike
down
the
arkansas
law?
justice
scalia
what--
--so
you're
saying
that
you
can
only
exclude
unreliable
evidence
except
where
the
unreliable
evidence
is
crucial.
where
the
unreliable
evidence
will
determine
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
then
you
have
to
let
it
in.
that's
a
very
strange
rule.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
the
more
unreliable
it
is.
the
more
important
it
is,
the
more
important
it
would
be
to
exclude
the
unreliable
evidence.
justice
scalia
well
the
difference
there
is
when
somebody
refreshes
his
recollection
that
way,
in
such
a
manner
that
he's
lying,
i
mean
he
knows
that
he
didn't
remember
it
before,
the
jury
can
observe
his
demeanor.
i
gather
that
the
really
nefarious
thing
about
hypnotically
induced
recollection
is
that
the
witness
himself
doesn't
know
that
the
recollection
is
inaccurate.
he
doesn't
know
he's
lying
because
the
hypnosis
could
of
had
that
effect.
so
the
jury
cannot
say,
you
know,
i
can
tell
by
his
demeanor
that
this
fellow
is
lying.
because
he
isn't
lying,
he
really
believes
he's
telling
the
truth.
isn't
that
different
from
the
other
kinds
of
refreshment
of
recollection
that
we
allow?
justice
scalia
how
does
that
work
when
you
don't
know,
when
there
is
no
record
of
what
was
recollected
prior
to
the
hypnotic
suggestion?
justice
scalia
would
xxx
the
witness--
justice
scalia
--right.
never
mind
this
case.
let's
assume
there
are
no
pre-hypnotic
notes.
i
just
walk
into
a
hypnotist
before
i
made
any
record
of
what
i
recollected
beforehand.
justice
scalia
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
testify
at
all.
justice
scalia
no,
not
to
anything
that
was
a
product
of
that
hypnosis.
i
would
not
be
able
to
testify
to
anything.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
oh,
sure,
sure.
justice
scalia
but
once,
unless
i
have,
the
burden
is
on
me
to
make
a
pre-hypnosis
record
of
whatever
the
hypnosis
is
going
to
cover
and
if
i
don't
do
that
whatever
the
subject
matter
of
the
hypnosis
happens
to
be
is
excluded
from
my
testimony.
justice
scalia
even
though,
in
fact,
i
remembered
a
lot
of
that
stuff
before
the
hypnosis.
since
i
can't
prove
that
i
did,
i
can't
testify
about
it.
justice
scalia
what
is
a
psycho
psychologist?
what
she
xxx.
[laughter]
a
psychologist
with
a
stutter
or
is
it...--
was
she
board
certified?
justice
scalia
is
there
a
physio
psychologist?
justice
scalia
mr.
luffman,
that's
not
unthinkable.
let
me
quote
you
from
nix
v.
whiteside
where
we
said
that
until
the
latter
part
of
the
preceding
century
criminal
defendants
in
this
country
as
at
common
law,
were
considered
to
be
disqualified
from
giving
sworn
testimony
at
their
own
trial,
by
reason
of
their
interest
as
a
party
to
the
case.
so
until
the
1900s
your
client
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
testify
at
all
in
many
states.
and
that
was
not
considered
to
violate
the
constitution.
now,
this
is
a
close
question
here.
even
if
we
hold
that
you
now
have
to
let
defendants
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
although
you
didn't
in
the
1800s,
even
though
you
have
to
let
them
testify,
how
can
we
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
this
close
call
must
go
in
one
way
rather
than
another
given
the
history
of
testimony
by
defendants?
justice
scalia
it's
assumed
to
be.
