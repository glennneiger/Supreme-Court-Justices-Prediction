have
you
ever
been
hypnotized?
justice
blackmun
do
you
know
of
any
instance
where
the
prosecution
in
arkansas
has
used
witnesses
that
have
been
subjected
to
hypnotism.
justice
blackmun
and
yet
prosecutors
in
arkansas
have
used
hypnotized
witnesses,
have
they
not.
justice
blackmun
there's
no
pretention
here
that
this
was
a
lie,
is
there?
justice
blackmun
well
it
seems
to
me
that
a
lot
of
what
you're
arguing
here
is
great
grist
for
a
jury
argument.
justice
blackmun
counsel,
i'll
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
of
your
opponent?
have
you
ever
been
hypnotized?
justice
blackmun
you
constantly
refer
to
ms.
back.
she
was
a
doctor,
was
she
not?
justice
blackmun
a
ph.
d?
justice
blackmun
so
that
your
reference
to
her
is
not
an
attempt
to
down
grade
her
testimony.
justice
blackmun
--well
many
psychologists
certainly
are
capable
of
administering
hypnosis.
