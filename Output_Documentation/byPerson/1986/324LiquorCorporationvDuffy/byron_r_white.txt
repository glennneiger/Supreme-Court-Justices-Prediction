justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
say
this
is
really
no
different
than
if
the
state
didn't
have
a
statute
and
the
wholesalers
just
made
agreements
with
retailers.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
it
would
be
no
different...
this
case
is
no
different
than
if
the
state
had
merely
authorized
the...
but
not
required
the
wholesalers
to
set
the
retailers'
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
law
that
permits
the
wholesaler
to
set
the
retailer's
price
establishes
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
minimum
markup
statute
all
that
means
is
that
you
must
mark
your
resale
price
up
a
certain
amount
over
what
you
bought
it
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
then
the
wholesaler
always
sets
a...
always
determines
what
price
he
is
selling
it
to
the
retailer.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
based
on
what
the
retailer
bought
it
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
it
be
any
different
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
wholesaler
can
set
his
price
as
high
as
he
wants,
as
he
can
sell
it
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
view
what
was
it
that
violated
the
antitrust
laws
in
midcal?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
need
to
do
that.
all
the...
they
could
either
do
that
or
they
could
post
their
wholesale
prices.
they
didn't
need
to
enter
into
fair
trade
contracts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
the
retailers
did
was
post
their
prices,
and
that
became
the
wholesale
price.
and
why
was
there
a
retail
price
maintenance
scheme
there
that
was
illegal
and
not
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
suggest
to
you
that
the
wholesalers
didn't
need
to
enter
into
fair
trade
contracts.
they
could
just
post
their
prices.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
midcal
was
just
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
what...
isn't
that
exactly
what
the
fact
was
in
midcal?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
wholesaler
could
either
bring
in
these
contracts
or
post
a
schedule
of
resale
prices.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
suggesting
that
we
just
went
off
the
deep
end
in
midcal.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
conduct
that
it
authorizes
or
requires
must
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
law
violates
the
sherman
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
statute
ends
up
being
unenforceable
because
the
conduct
violates
the
sherman
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
disregard
midcal
you
are
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
midcal
all
you
needed
was
one
fair
trade
contract,
too,
wasn't
it?
just
one,
and
that
bound
everybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
one...
at
most
by
one
retailer,
even
if
they
went
the
fair
trace
contract
route.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
midcal
decided
that
the
conduct
authorized
in
the
california
statute
violated
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
assumed,
assumed,
but
did
it
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
decide
it
or
it
just
assumed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hall,
why
don't
you
argue
that
this
is
just
a
minimum
markup
law?
what
else
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
requires
a
minimum
markup
on
the
bottle
price
but
it
is
still
just
a
minimum...
is
still
just
a
requirement
for
a
markup
on
whatever
price
the
wholesaler
sets.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
argument,
you
would
make
the
same
kind
of
an
argument
if
the
wholesaler...
if
there
wasn't
any
state
imposed
minimum
markup
but
the
state
just
permitted
wholesalers
to
set
the
resale
price
that
retailers
had
to
sell
at.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
yes,
so
that
is...
and
that
is
what
you
are
arguing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
is
no
difference
between
that
situation
and
this
minimum
markup
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
again
we
get
back
to
midcal
and
schwegmann.
