chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
afternoon
in
no.
84-2022,
324
liquor
corporation
doing
business
as
yorkshire
wine
and
spirits
versus
thomas
duffy.
mr.
kantor,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it
didn't
violate
the
sherman
act
you
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
anyway,
would
you?
i
mean,
the
question
is
whether
the
state
can
do
something
that
does
violate
the
sherman
act
on
the
grounds
of
the
21st
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
may
be
a
sufficient
argument,
and
i
gather
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
you,
to
dispel
the
state
action
exemption,
the
parker
against
brown,
but
that
still
doesn't
answer,
by
itself
doesn't
answer
the
21st
amendment
question,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cannon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
essential,
mr.
cannon,
for
us
to
conclude
that
there
may
be
at
least
some
connection
between
protecting
small
retailers
and
the
new
york
statute.
is
it
essential
that
the
court
of...
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
made
such
a
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
legislature...
supposing
this
appeal
were
brought
a
month
after
the
statute
was
passed,
regardless
of
anything
conceivable
you
would
surely
make
the
same
statement.
the
statute
hasn't
preserved
small
retailers
because
it
hasn't
yet
been
in
operation
long
enough
to
tell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
that
the
state
has
a
heavy
burden,
because
the
statute,
as
you
put
it,
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
the
sherman
act?
if
it
flew
more
laterally
would
the
state
have
a
lighter
burden?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
state
needn't
worry
about
the
situations
where
it
doesn't
have
a
sherman
act
violation.
but
is
it
your
position
that
no
matter
what
the
state
interest
under
either
parker
against
brown
or
under
the
21st
amendment,
if
there
is
a
sherman
act
violation
the
state
interest
can't
prevail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cannon.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
hall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hall.
mr.
kantor,
do
you
have
something
more?
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
