mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it,
please
the
court,
in
midcal
this
court
confronted
a
state
statutory
scheme
it
found
to
be
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
statute
could
not
be
saved
by
either
the
state
action
doctrine
or
the
21st
amendment.
the
united
states
submits
today
that
the
faults
this
court
found
with
the
california
wine
pricing
statute
in
midcal
are
equally
present
in
the
new
york
statute
before
you.
as
in
midcal,
the
new
york
statute
creates
a
resale
price
maintenance
scheme.
liquor
wholesalers
control
the
retail
price
of
liquor.
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
new
york
legislature
specifically
recognized
that
the
state
sanctions
resale
price
maintenance.
as
in
midcal,
the
real
question
posed
by
this
case
is
whether
such
resale
price
maintenance
is
protected
from
invalidation
by
the
state
action
doctrine
or
alternatively
the
21st
amendment,
rather.
we
believe
it
is
saved
by
neither.
as
for
the
state
action
doctrine,
clearly
the
first
prong
of
midcal
is
met.
just
as
clearly,
the
second
prong
is
not.
we
think
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
absolutely
correct
in
finding
that
the
state
of
new
york
does
not
actively
supervise
the
setting
of
retail
prices.
to
the
contrary,
the
state
has
abdicated
that
function
to
private
wholesalers.
to
respond
to
justice
scalia's
question
on
this
point,
in
fact,
the
bottle
price
is
not
an
actual
price.
it
beers
no
relationship
to
the
actual
price
that
the
wholesaler
purchased
the
liquor
from
the
manufacturer
and
in
fact
bears
no
relationship
to
what
the
wholesaler
is
actually
going
to
sell
to
the
retailer.
so,
to--
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
--justice
scalia,
no.
the
statute
surely
says
that
the
wholesaler--
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
--pardon
me?
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
well,
it
is
certainly
possible,
as
mr.
kantor
said,
in
rare
situations
to
sell
in
less
than
cases.
certainly
in
this
case
the
purchases
in
question
were
on
cases.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
but
only
in
theory,
your
honor,
and
the
problem
with
the
statute
here
is
by
allowing
the
wholesaler
to
independently
set
the
bottle
price
as
opposed
to
the
case
price,
there
is
no
necessary
correlation.
you
have
to
think
of
the
bottle
price
as
merely
the
mechanism
by
which
this
statute
allows
the
wholesaler
to
engage
in
resale
price
maintenance,
and
that
is
the
crux
of
the
case.
your
honor,
this
court
has
recognized
on
many
occasions
the
importance
of
our
strong
federal
policy
of
promoting
competition.
new
york's
stated
interest
in
protecting
retailers
from
competition
is
directly
contradictory
to
and
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
sherman
act.
new
york's
resale
price
maintenance
statute
is
not
protected
by
the
21st
amendment
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
state's
interest
in
protecting
small
retailers
from
competition
is
not
within
the
core
of
21st
amendment
interests
this
court
described
in
its
crisp
decision.
the
time,
place,
or
manner
of
the
importation
or
use
of
liquor
is
not
directly
implicated
here.
secondly,
even
the
tenuous
connection
with
the
21st
amendment
that
this
statute
is
supposed
to
have
has
not
been
substantiated.
the
court
of
appeals
made
no
finding
that
the
statute
has
actually
protected
small
liquor
retailers.
third--
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
--well,
your
honor,
i
assume
it
is
not
absolutely
essential.
however,
the
problem
here,
as
this
court
stated
in
midcal,
when
one
is
balancing
or
trying
to
reconcile
the
strong
federal
interest
in
competition
against
a
state's
stated
interest
in
protecting
retailers,
and
in
this
case
in
protecting
them
from
all
competition,
then
as
the
court
said
in
midcal
the
state
interest
must
surely
be
substantiated
before
you
can
even
attempt
to
reconcile
the
two.
in
this
case
there
is
absolutely
no
indication,
no
evidence
that
in
fact
this
particular
statute
has
preserved
small
retailers.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
your
honor,
it
is
important
to
recognize
here
that
the
interest
of
the
state
is
effectuating
a
private
price-fixing
scheme.
no
more
and
no
less.
while
it
may
say
it
is
doing
this
to
protect
private
retailers,
we
must
know
that
this
in
fact
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
the
sherman
act.
that
being
the
case,
the
state
has
a
very
heavy
burden
in
order
to
reconcile
the
statute,
and
it
cannot
do
that.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
well,
your
honor,
if
in
fact,
the
state
chose
to
protect
small
retailers
in
another
manner
such
as
the
law
in
new
york
which
prohibits
any
retail
liquor
store
owner
from
having
more
than
one
outlet.
that
doesn't...
that
is
not
a
sherman
act
violation,
at
least
that
this
court
recognizes,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
well,
your
honor,
again,
it
depends
on
the
type
of
statute
or
the
type
of
manner
in
which
the
state
is
trying
to
advance
the
interest
in
protecting
small
retailers.
again,
here
we
have
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
as
i
say,
there
may
be
other
types
of
protection
that
the
state
may
offer
such
as
are
in
this
statute
of
prohibiting
discriminatory
discounts
or
gift
allowances
or
loss
leader
prohibitions.
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
we
are
addressing
or
looking
at
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
and
given
the
federal
interest,
the
strong
federal
interest
in
promoting
competition
we
have
a
state
statute
that
achieves
the
very
opposite,
which
is
to
eliminate
competition
on
the
retail
level.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
your
honor,
yes.
the
problem
with
this
case,
of
course,
or
the
statute
is
that
the
state
has
abdicated
the
responsibility
of
pricing
at
the
retail
level
for
the
wholesalers.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
authorized
but
not
required?
well,
your
honor,
of
course,
if
in
fact
the
state
itself
had
attempted
to
set
prices--
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
--that
would
be
quite
a
different
thing.
the
problem
we
have
here
is
this
abdication
of
the
state's
ability...
setting
prices.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
this
quote
in
parker
and
in
succeeding
cases,
this
clearly
said
the
state
does
not
have
the
ability
to
authorize
private
price-fixing
agreements
among
private
parties.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
justice
stevens,
that
is
quite
a
different
matter
in
that
the
discretion
afforced
to
the
private
parties
would
be
far
less,
and
in
fact
the
parties
would
have
no--
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
--i
think
it
certainly
comes
much
closer
to
being
protected
under
the
state
action
doctrine,
much
closer.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
i
would
simply
say
that
it
would
come
much
closer
to
state
action.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
because,
your
honor,
in
a
minimum
markup
statute
a
private
party
would
not
have
the
discretion
as
it
has
in
this
case
to
set
prices,
and
a
minimum
markup
statute
such
as
the
statute,
the
connecticut
statute
that
the
second
circuit
upheld
in
the
morgan
case
recently--
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
--that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
in
this
statute,
your
honor,
in
this
statutory
scheme
the
state
of
new
york
has
not
required
the
wholesaler
to
set
its
price
to
the
retailer
based
on
what
the
wholesaler
bought
the
liquor
for.
there
is
absolutely
no
requirement
of
any
relation--
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
--no,
sir,
what
the
wholesaler
bought
it
for.
when
the
wholesaler
buys
from
the
manufacturer--
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
--that
is
when
the
state
supervision
breaks
down.
the
wholesaler
then
is
not
required
to
determine
its
price
to
the
retailer
on
any
basis
of
cost.
it
can
make
it
up
literally
out
of
thin
air.
on
the
other
hand,
in
a
minimum
markup
statute
then
usually--
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
--in
a
minimum
markup
statute?
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
well,
in
that--
mr.
w.
stephen
cannon
--your
honor,
in
the
connecticut
case,
the
connecticut
statute,
the
morgan
case,
for
instance,
there,
once
the
liquor
crossed
the
connecticut
state
line,
the
state
then
said
mr.
wholesaler,
before
you
are
able
to...
the
price
that
you
must
sell
your
liquor
to
the
retailer
is
a
certain
amount
based
over
your
cost,
and
that
is
the
key
difference
here,
is
the
state
action
controls
the
price.
in
this
case
the
wholesaler
is
allowed
to
make
up
its
own
price.
thank
you.
