mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
afternoon
i
would
like
to
establish
three
points
in
my
argument.
the
first
is
that
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
for
resale...
for
retail
liquor
pricing
constitutes
resale
price
maintenance,
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
establish
is
that
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
is
not
saved
by
the
state
action
exemption.
and
the
third
proposition
is
that
the
statutory
scheme
is
not
saved
by
the
21st
amendment.
just
some
brief
background
to
begin
with.
appellant
is
a
neighborhood
liquor
store
located
in
manhattan
who
was
suspended
by
the
state
liquor
authority
for
alleged
violation
of
section
101(b)(b)
of
the
new
york
alcoholic
beverage
control
law
in
that
the
appellant
had
made
two
retail
sales
of
liquor
below
the
minimum
resale
price
for
such
items
which
had
been
set
by
the
wholesaler
for
those
items
in
the
month
in
question.
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
appellant
was
found
to
have
violated
a
statute
which
ostensibly
requires
a
12
percent
markup
over
what
the
statute
calls
18
percent
markup
on
the
sales
in
question.
now,
the
explanation
for
this
curious
phenomenon
which
i
have
described
is
that
section
101(b)(b)
does
not
require
a
minimum
markup
over
the
retailer's
actual
cost,
but
rather
over
something
called
the
bottle
price,
which
is
able
to
be
set
by
the
wholesaler
freely
without
any
state
supervision
or
control.
however,
the
economic
reality
is
that
the
bottle
price
is
not
a
good
proxy
for
the
retailer's
actual
cost
because
retailers
rarely
purchase
liquor
from
wholesalers
by
the
bottle.
they
rather
purchase
by
the
case.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
yes,
justice--
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
--well,
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
he
would
charge
the
bottle
price
to
the
retailer
in
the
event
that
the
retailer
sought
to
acquire
his
liquor
in
less
than
case
lots.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
yes,
i
believe
so.
the
example
that
comes
to
mind
is
the
rare
bottle
of
40
or
50
year
old
scotch
that
a
retailer
may
purchase
one
bottle
from
a
wholesaler
or
let's
say
a
very
exotic
brandy
or
something
like
that.
the
products
that
were
involved
here
were
something
called
chatham
gin
in
a
1.75
liter
bottle,
which
is
not
an
item
you
would
acquire
by
the
bottle.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
i
would
accept
the
first
portion
of
your
proposition.
i
will
not
accept
the
second.
it
is
a
real
price
in
that
it
is
available
should
the
retailer
want
to
buy
by
the
bottle
in
the
unlikely
event.
the
second
portion
of
the
proposition
is
that
the
real
world
consequences
of
setting
a
high
bottle
price
is
that
you
lose
very
few
sales
because
the
bulk
of
your
sales
are
made
at
retail.
what
we
have
here,
and
the
record
demonstrates
this,
is
the
ability
of
the
wholesaler
to
control
the
bottle
price
and
the
case
price
and
the
relationship
thereto
and
thereby
to
confer
in
some
cases
supercompetitive
profits
of
over
30
percent
on
retailers.
the
record
further
contains
actual
advertisements
which
are
placed
by
wholesalers
in
liquor
trade
journals
in
which
the
wholesaler
traders
the
fact
to
the
retailer
as
a
selling
point
that
we
are
going
to
confer
upon
you
markups
of
20
percent,
28
percent,
30
percent.
in
fact,
one
ad
says
we
have
a
whole
line
of
liquor
that
can
give
you
a
30
percent
markup.
so
something
is
awry
here.
you
do
not
have
a
normal
situation.
this
clearly
is
not
a
statute
that
mandates
a
12
percent
markup
on
a
real
retailer
cost.
now,
under
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
that
i
am
referring
to,
101(b)(b),
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
held
below
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
statute
does
not
mandate
a
correlation
between
the
case
and
bottle
prices
filed
by
the
wholesaler.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
below
that
the
state
does
not
actively
supervise
the
wholesaler's
price
filings.
as
a
result,
under
the
new
york
statutory
scheme,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
a
wholesaler
is
free
to
set
a
high
bottle
price
in
relation
to
his
case
price,
and
thereby
confer
supercompetitive
profits
upon
retailers.
now,
why
this
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
is
that
the
sherman
act
clearly
condemns
resale
price
maintenance.
further,
this
is
a
combination
in
unreasonable
restraint
of
section
1
in
that
the
wholesaler
under
the
statute
is
given
the
power
to
set
price
with
no
state
involvement,
and
the
retailers
are
compelled
by
state
enforcement
of
the
statute
to
adhere
to
the
retail
price,
minimum
retail
price
fixed
by
the
wholesaler.
thus
you
have
the
same
kind
of
a
combination
that
was
struck
down
in
parke
davis
or
in
schwegmann,
indeed
in
midcal.
in
fact,
the
state's
opinion
does
not...
the
opinion
of
the
state
court
below
does
not
even
discuss
whether
this
is
a
price
maintenance
scheme.
it
assumes
it.
it
states
clearly
this
is
a
price
maintenance
scheme.
indeed,
in
the
portion
of
the
opinion
below
that
deals
with
state
action
in
determining
that
it
was
not
state
action
holds
that
this
price
maintenance
scheme
is
not
actively
supervised
by
the
state.
the
only
reason
that
we
are
here
is
because
the
state
court
below
found
that
the
statute
was
consistent
with
the
21st
amendment.
and
i
will
perhaps
address
the
temperance
and
21st
amendment
questions
to
save
some
time.
in
justifying
the
statute
under
the
21st
amendment,
again,
the
state
court
below
was
silent
on
the
issue
of
temperance.
this
is
because
there
is
no
legislative
history
which
indicates
that
the
statute
was
based
on
temperance.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
justice
o'connor,
it
is
not
my
position.
it
is
my
position
that
in
this
case
the
conflict
between
state
law
as
represented
by
101(b)(b)
and
the
federal
law
as
represented
by
the
sherman
act
was
needlessly
created
by
the
state.
there
are
many
ways
in
which
the
state
presumably
could
properly
address
the
question
of
protecting
small
retailers
under
the
21st
amendment.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
yes,
i
would
concede
that
if
the
state,
for
example,
were
to
put
in
place
a
mechanism
whereby
the
state
determined
the
liquor
prices,
that
would
not
cause
my
problem.
i
would
further
concede
that
if
we
had
a
statute
here
that
sought
to
concern
loss
leaders
or
predatory
pricing
of
some
sort,
that
that
would
not
cause
a
problem.
i
further
concede
that
if
you
had
a
statute
here
which
sought
to
prohibit
sales
below
actual
cost,
that
would
not
create
a
problem.
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
state
has
created
a
retail
price
maintenance
scheme
under
the
guise
of
protecting
small
retailers,
and
thus
has
needlessly
offended
the
sherman
act.
if
the
state
sought
to
approach
this
some
other
way,
that
would
be
a
different
case
than
i
believe
the
case
we
have
here.
i
would
submit
that
what
we
have
here
is
midcal.
all
that
has
changed
is
the
means--
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
--i
don't
know
that
i
would
agree
that
there
is
more
of
a
record
here
about
preservation
of
small
retailers.
in
fact,
the
state's
claim
that
this
statute
preserves
small
retailers
is
totally
unsubstantiated.
the
record
here
is
that
in
1971,
when
101(b)(b)
was
passed
there
were
approximately
5,000
retailers
in
the
state
of
new
york.
as
of
july,
'86,
there
were
approximately
3,000
retailers.
therefore
it
would
be
very
hard
to
make
an
argument
that
this
statute
has
protected
small
retailers.
in
addition,
even
assuming
arguendo
that
it
had,
and
i
think
we
have
established
it
had
not,
it
is
the
state
that
is
needlessly
creating
the
conflict
here
between
state
and
federal
law.
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
state
could
address
the
subject
of
protecting
small
retailers
in
a
way
that
did
not
violate
the
sherman
act
that
would
be
a
different
case
than
this
case.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
presumably
the
state
might
be
able
to
do
something
that
might
otherwise
violate
the
sherman
act
if
it
actively
supervised
what
went
on.
the
court
below
stated
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
believe
correctly,
that
there
is
no
state
supervision
or
control
over
the
prices
determined
by
the
wholesalers.
what
we
have
here
is
the
gauzy
cloak
that
the
court
talked
about
in
midcal.
in
other
words,
the
state
statute
creates
a
gauzy
cloak
of
state
involvement
in
a
private
price-fixing
scheme
without
any
state
supervision
or
control
of
that.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
no,
but
there
are
two
parts
to
a
21st
amendment
question,
your
honor.
one
is
temperance
and
the
other
is
protection
of
small
retailers.
the
court
below
did
not
in
any
way
seek
to
justify
this
statute
on
the
basis
of
temperance.
the
state
comes
in
here
now
in
the
supreme
court
and
argues
that
somehow
temperance
is
involved
because
by
allowing
wholesalers
to
fix
prices
and
to
set
high
minimum
resale
prices
this
somehow
would
encourage
temperance.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
legislature
in
passing
this
statute
in
1971
said
that
the
evidence
on
the
relationship
between
liquor
prices
and
liquor
consumption
was
very
foggy,
and
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
price
for
liquor
is
elastic.
indeed,
it
appears,
and
we
have
lodged
studies
with
the
court
in
this
case,
that
the
price
for
liquor
is
inelastic.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
wholesalers
are
content
to
set
high
bottle
prices
which
result
in
high
minimum
resale
prices,
because
they
don't
lose
anything.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
well,
they
don't...
they
clearly
don't
lose
any
business
to
other
brands
because
apparently
everybody
engages
in
parallel
behavior.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
attacking
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
horizontal
arrangement,
but
the
record
indicates
that
certainly
this
vertical
price-fixing
arrangement
certainly
has
horizontal
overtones.
for
example,
in
the
instance
of
smirnoff
vodka,
the
product
which
is
one
of
the
two
sales
involved
in
our
case
here,
there
were
three
wholesalers,
and
all
of
them,
while
having
somewhat
different
case
prices,
had
the
same
bottle
price,
so
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
plenty
of--
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
--because--
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
--well,
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
wholesaler
of
let's
say
gordon's
vodka
when
he
sets
his
minimum
resale
price
through
setting
the
bottle
price,
obviously
casts
an
eye
over
what
his
rivals
are
doing
vis-a-vis
smirnoff
vodka.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
well,
your
honor,
many
of
these
dealers
don't,
have
one
brand
of
vodka,
they
have
numerous
brands
of
vodka,
so
there
is
an
element
of
horizontality
here.
in
other
words,
the
wholesaler
when
he
is
setting
the
bottle
price
of
a
panoply
of
vodkas
that
he
is
selling
is
in
effect
determining
the
minimum
resale
price
for,
let's
say,
gordon's,
fleischman's,
and
smirnoff,
because
he
is
the
wholesaler
of
all
three
of
those.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
that
is
what
this
court
has
said,
and
that
is
what
i
understand
to
be
the
law.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
could.
mr.
bertram
k.
kantor
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
have
no
further
argument.
