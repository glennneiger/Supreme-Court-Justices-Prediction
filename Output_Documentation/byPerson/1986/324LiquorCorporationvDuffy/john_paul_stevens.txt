--what
would
you
say
to
a
state
statute
that
simply
provided
a
minimum
markup
of
12
percent
over
what
the
retailer
paid
the
wholesaler?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it
is
different.
i
am
just
curious
to
know
whether
you
think
it
would
be
valid
or
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it
comes
closer.
i
just
wonder
whether
you
think
it
is
valid
or
invalid.

[generallaughter.]
if
you
don't
know
you
can
say
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
it
depose
the
12
percent...
does
it
decide
what
the
12
percent
markup
shall
be
imposed
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
fixes
the
bottle
price?
the
state
fixes
the
bottle
price?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
mainly
governs
the
time
when
he
makes
the
change
or
the
announcement.
he
can
raise
his
bottle
price
50
cents
one
month
after
another,
can't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
can't
say
the
bulletin
doesn't
interpret
the
statute,
do
you?
should
we
disregard
the
bulletin
or
assume
it
is
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
would
you
answer
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
answer
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
we
assume
that
the
bulletin
is
a
correct
construction
of
the
statute
or
an
incorrect
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hall,
do
you
think
we
have
also
overruled
the
schwegmann
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
meeting
of
the
mind
there.
it
was
all
done
by
state
power
on
the
nonsigners.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
you
needed
in
schwegmann
was
one
resale
contract
that
bound
the
whole
trade,
and
that
was
the
coercive
power
of
government
was
part
of
what
was
at
stake,
just
as
it
was
in
midcal.
but
you
say
we
should
ignore
the
governmental
power
and
just
look
for
a
private
agreement.
that
is
your
understanding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
difference
between
this
case
and
your
berkeley
rent
case
is,
there
a
public
decisionmaker
made
a
decision
that
affected
the
entire
market.
there
was
no
enforcement...
marketwide
enforcement
of
a
private
decision.
here
you
have
got
private
decisions
on
what
the
bottle
price
shall
be
to
which
the
statute
gives
marketwide
enforcement
effect.
you
have
got
a
mixture
of
the
private
and
public
decisionmaking
power
which
you
did
not
have
in
the
berkeley
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
had
that
in
midcal,
and
you
had
that
in
schwegmann.
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
been
for
themselves.
one
landlord
didn't
fix
another
landlord's
rent.
the
only
marketwide
effect
of
any
decision
was
a
public
decision
by
the
municipality,
but
you
don't
have
that
here.
