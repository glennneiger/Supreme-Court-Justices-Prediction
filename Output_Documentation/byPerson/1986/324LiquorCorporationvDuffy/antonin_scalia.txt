the
bottle
price
is
a
real
price.
it
is
the
real
price
at
which
the
wholesaler
would
have
to
sell
it
if
he
sold
it
by
the
bottle.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
he
wouldn't
be
a
wholesaler,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
do
you
charge
the
bottle
price
to,
anyway?
who
does
the
wholesaler
charge
the
bottle
price
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
buys
one
and
a
half
cases
he
gets
half
a
case
at
the
bottle
price.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
still
not
theoretically
just
a
made
up
resale
price
that
the
wholesaler
can
impose
without
any
real
world
consequences
to
himself.
it
is
a
real
price,
the
price
at
which
he
will
sell
less
than
case
bottles.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
they
lose
business
to
other
brands.
it
isn't
a
system
that
prevents
interbrand
competition.
you
have
to
have
brand
loyalty
or
somebody
else
can
take
up
the
slack
by
having
a
lower
bottle
price,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
smirnoff
in
particular?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
what
about
other
vodka?
people
don't
have
to
buy
smirnoff.
you
know,
smirnoff
is
priced
too
high,
people
buy
another
vodka.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
has
to
be
some
smart
fellow
who
figures
he
will
sell
a
lot
more
at
a
lower
price.
i
thought
that's
the
way
the
thing
works.
justice
antonin
scalia
anyway,
i
gather
resale
price
maintenance
is
per
se
invalid,
whether
or
not
it
in
fact
restricts
trade.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
denying
that
if
the
wholesaler
sells
to
the
retailer
in
less
than
a
case
he
has
to
charge
the
bottle
price?
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
you
are
just
saying
he
doesn't
sell
in
less
than
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
just
saying
he
doesn't
in
fact
sell
in
less
than
case
lots.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
purpose
of
my
question
was
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
normal
resale
price
maintenance,
where
the
price
established
is
simply
a
price
at
which
the
retailer
will
sell
to
the
customer,
and
it
has
no
other
independent
validation
whatever,
whereas
here
the
bottle
price
is
really
in
theory,
at
least,
the
price
at
which
the
bottle
will
be
sold
by
the
wholesaler
to
the
retailer.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
setting
it
initially?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
he
can't
change
it
after
that
except?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what,
that
he
is
charged
a
higher
price
by
the
manufacturer?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
did
the
promotional
situations
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
arise?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
prices
have
we
just
been
talking
about
that
can't
be
altered,
the
case
price
or
the
bottle
price
or
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
say
that
a
statute
that
allows
such
exceptions
is
facially
invalid.
i
mean,
you
know,
if
you
insist
that
we
do
it
on
the
face.
i
assume
that
the
ability
to
make
exceptions
is
part
of
the
face.
justice
antonin
scalia
including
an
exception
of
this
sort
that
would
allow
you
to
fix
whatever
price
you
want
for
bottles.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
order
to
find
that
a
state
law
is
preempted
by
the
sherman
act
and
is
incompatible
with
the
sherman
act,
do
we
have
to
find
that
the
state
law
violates
the
sherman
act?
isn't
it
enough
to
find
that
the
scheme
that
it
sets
up
so
frustrates
the
purposes
of
the
sherman
act,
as
justice
o'connor
just
described,
that
it
is
invalid.
we
don't
have
to
find
that
it
violates
the
sherman
act
in
and
of
itself,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
a
markup
usually
means
a
markup
on
what
he
pays,
not
on
what
he
says.
i
mean,
the
problem
here
is,
it
is
not
a
markup
on
what
he
pays.
he
pays
the
case
price
and
charges
the
markup
on
the
bottle
price,
which
is
not
the
price
he
pays.
that
is
not
a
markup.
i
mean,
you
can
call
it
a
markup,
but
it
is
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
they
are
not
equally
artificial.
this
bears
no
relationship
to
what
he
paid
for
this
bottle
that
he
sold.
he
bought
the
bottle
at
a
case
price.
he
has
to
charge
the
markup
over
the
bottle
price,
even
though
he
didn't
buy
it
at
the
bottle
price.
that
is
just
no
relationship.
it
is
not
a
markup.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
as
distinct
from
the
bulletin?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
aren't
we
dealing
with
the
bulletin?
