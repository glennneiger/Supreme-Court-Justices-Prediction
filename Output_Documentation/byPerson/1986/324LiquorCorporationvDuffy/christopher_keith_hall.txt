mr.
christopher
keith
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
new
york
may
impose
a
statutory
minimum
markup
on
retail
liquor
prices
when
that
statute
which
prohibits
below
cost
pricing
operates
entirely
within
the
state
and
involves
no
concerted
action
between
independent
entities.
there
are
three
separate
reasons
why
this
court
should
reject
appellant's
facial
attack
on
the
below
cost
statute
and
its
as
applied
attack
on
that
statute
which
is
limited
to
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
bulletin.
first,
there
is
no
contract
combination
or
conspiracy.
second,
the
state's
direct
imposition
of
the
price
restraint
is
ipso
facto
immune
under
hoover
v.
ronwin.
and
third,
the
state
was
acting
pursuant
to
its
core
constitutional
power
under
the
21st
amendment
to
structure
its
liquor
distribution
system
to
address
perceived
flaws
in
its
local
market.
last
term
in
fisher
this
court
reiterated
that
when
a
statute
is
challenged
on
its
face
under
the
antitrust
laws
this
court
will
strike
it
on
preemption
grounds
only
if
it
mandates
or
authorizes
conduct
which
necessarily
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
all
cases
or
if
it
places
irresistible
pressure
on
private
parties
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
as
the
chief
justice
explained
in
norman
williams,
such
facial
condemnation
follows
only
if
the
conduct
contemplated
by
the
statute
is
in
all
cases
a
per
se
violation.
if
it
is
not,
this
court
will
analyze
it
under
the
rule
of
reason
and
will
not
condemn
it
in
the
abstract.
in
fisher
this
court
faced
an
identical
facial
challenge
to
a
rent
control
ordinance
in
the
city
of
berkeley
under
which
the
landlords
claimed
that
the
ordinance
formed
a
combination
between
the
city
and
its
officials
on
the
one
hand
and
landlords
on
the
other,
or
a
horizontal
combination
among
landlords.
as
justice
marshall
explained,
even
though
the
economic
effect
of
that
ordinance
was
exactly
the
same
as
a
horizontal
combination
among
landlords,
a
restraint
imposed
unilaterally
does
not
become
concerted
action
simply
because
it
has
a
coercive
effect
on
parties
who
must
obey
the
law.
new
york's
statute
here
operates
exactly
the
same
way.
it
directly
imposes
the
12
percent
markup
on
retailers.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
under
the
statute,
yes,
it
provides
a--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--the
state
set
forth
a
detailed
statutory
scheme
for
establishing
the
bottle
price
in
which
the
wholesaler
has
very
limited
ability
to
change
and
can
only
change
in
accordance
with
those
statutory
commands.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
under
the
statute
he
can
only
raise
his
price
if
the
manufacturer's
price
to
the
wholesaler
changes
or
if
its
labor
costs
or
other
operating
costs
go
up
and
it
secures
the
permission
of
the
state
enforcement
agency,
the
sla,
to
make
that
change,
but
the
wholesaler
has
no
freedom
under
the
statute
to
change--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--well,
for
the
bulk
of
the
prices
under
the
statute
those
prices
were
set
by
the
state
in
1967
when
it
froze
the
percentage
markup
over
manufacturers'
prices.
it
is
true
that
with
new
items
or
a
new
wholesaler
coming
onto
the
market
it
has
freedom
to
set
that
initial
price.
at
that
moment,
however,
that
ceases
to
be
a
free
market
price,
and
that
price
is
controlled
from
then
on
under
the
statute
under
rigid
statutory
controls.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
except
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
for
example--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--if
the
manufacturer
raises
its
price
to
the
wholesale--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--then
the
wholesaler
can
raise
its
price
by
an
equivalent
percentage.
that
is
one
instance
under
the
statute.
another
instance,
with
the
sla's
permissions,
it
can
raise
in
response
to
increased
labor
operating
costs,
but
only
with
the
permission--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--two
years
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
the
state
enforcement
agency,
the
sla,
promulgated
a
bulletin
which
permitted
the
wholesaler
to
conduct
temporary
sales
as
an
exception
from
the
normal
operation
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
sla
and
rule
l6,
which
mandates
that
the
case
and
the
bottle
price
under
the
statute
be
linked
lockstep
with
only
that
breakage
charge
differentiating.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
both,
under
the
statute,
as
opposed
to
the
bulletin.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
well,
we
are
faced
here
with
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
under
the--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--yes.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
it
is
a
correct
application
of
the
sla's
power
to
make
exceptions
in
the
statute,
and
that
is...
from
the
normal
operation,
and
that
is
exactly
how
the
court
below
construed
it.
it
is
simply
an
exception
from...
it
construed...
it
construed
the
statute
in
rule
16
as
linking
the
two
prices.
that
is--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--it
is
true
that
the
sla
on
the
face
of
the
statute
has
the
power
to
make
exceptions,
yes,
from
the
statute.
that
is
true.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
that's
correct,
but
in
construing
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute
on
the
antitrust
laws
this
court
has
made
clear
that
it
will
strike
it
on
preemption
grounds
only
if
that
statute
mandates
or
authorizes
conduct
which
is
going
to
be
a
per
se
violation
in
all
cases,
and
the
statute
doesn't
permit
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
in
midcal,
in
midcal
the
court
focused
on
california's
statutory
requirement
that
parties
enter
into
fair
trade
contracts.
that
was
the
first--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--that
is
correct,
but
the--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--the
aspect
of
the
resale
price
maintenance
scheme
in
midcal
that
was
a
per
se
violation
was
the
fair
trade
contract.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
that's
correct.
but
if
this
court
were
to
face
the
issue
squarely,
which
it
did
not
in
midcal,
of
whether
a
unilaterally
imposed
price
schedule
violated
the
antitrust
laws
because
it
formed
a
meeting
of
the
minds
between
the
manufacturer
and
the
wholesaler
in
that
case,
it
would
decide
it
differently
in
light
of
its
reaffirmation
of
the
colgate
doctrine
in
monsanto,
in
copperweld,
and
in
fisher.
if
the
government
were
not
involved
a
wholesaler
under
the
colgate
doctrine
would
be
perfectly
free
to
announce
that
it
was
going
to
establish
a
retail...
a
resale
price,
and
the
retailer
is
free
to
acquiesce
in
that
price,
and
the
wholesaler
is
free
to
terminate
that--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--to
the
extent
that
midcal
is
read
to
apply
as
well
to
the
price
schedules
this
court
would
decide
it
differently
today.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
in
midcal
there
was,
according
to
the
state
court--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--that's
correct.
however,
a
holding
that
a
filing
of
a
price
schedule
constitutes
a
meeting
of
the
minds
between
the
manufacturer
and
the
wholesaler
in
that
case
would
not
be
squared
with
this
court's
reaffirmation
of
the
colgate--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--i
would
suggest
that
that,
if
it
is
read,
midcal
is
read
that
broadly,
this
court
would,
squarely
faced
with
the
issue,
would
decide
it
differently,
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
has
made
clear
in
monsanto
and
copperweld
and
in
fisher
itself,
that
in
order
to
establish
a
violation
of
the
section
1
you
must
have
a
meeting
of
the
minds.
you
must
have
concerted
action.
you
must
have
combination.
you
must
have
a
conspiracy,
and
the
solicitor
general
has
expressly
stated
in
his
brier
that
under
new
york's--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--no.
your
honor,
because--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--well,
as
justice
douglas's
opinion
makes
clear,
there
was
concerted
action
by
the
distributors
together
using
their
fair
trade
contract
which
had
been
exempted
under
the
miller-tidings
law
as
a
club
to
coerce
the
retailer.
there
was
concerted
action
in
schwegmann.
there
was
concerted
action
among
the
distributors.
there
was
concerted
action
among
the
distributors
and--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--but
in
schwegmann
the
entire...
well,
the
entire
enforcement
was
by
private
parties.
it
was
not...
it
was
not
enforced
by
the
government.
but
even
assuming
that
this
court
were
to
interpret
schwegmann
as
not
involving
any
concerted
action
between
the
distributors
or
between
the
distributors
together
with
the
signers,
it
cannot
be
squared
with
the
colgate
doctrine.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
there
would
be--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--section
1,
according
to
its
plain
language,
as
this
court
found
in
copperweld,
addresses
only
concerted
action,
action
which
involves
a
meeting
of
the
minds
between...
where
the
state
there
is
unilaterally
imposing
that
price
requirement
on
private
parties,
even
though
that
may
be
a
gap
in
the
section
l's
coverage
of
restraints
of
trade,
nothing
in
section
1
reaches
out
to
cover
that.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
yes,
you
go,
justice
scalia.
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
fisher.
that
was
the
argument
raised
by
mr.
smock
in
the
oral
argument
in
fisher,
and
as
justice
white
pressed
him
on
that
point,
is
a
conflict
with
the
policy
sufficient,
because
he
was
not
arguing
a
violation.
this
court
squarely
rejected
it
and
said
in
its
central
language
in
fisher
there
must
be
a
violation
of
section
1.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
the
conduct...
here
there
is
no...
under
the
statute--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--but
there
is
no
such
conduct
here.
there
is,
as
the
solicitor
general
recognized--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--to
the
extent
that
midcal
was
read
to
apply
to
the
price
schedules,
but
if
you
look
at
the
language
in
midcal,
page
102,
this
court
was
addressing
the
effect
of
the
repeal
of
miller
tidings
act
on
fair
trade
contracts,
and
that
is
exactly
the
language
it
was
using
in--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--that's
correct,
but
there
was
at
least
some
concerted
action
under
that
aspect
of
the
statute
which
would--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--that's
correct,
but
looking
at
the
new
york
statute
here
there
simply
is
no
agreement
between
wholesaler
and
retailer.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
well,
the
entire--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--but
in
berkeley
the
entire
ordinance
was
based
on
privately
set
prices
which
the
ordinance--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--under
the
statute
we
do.
we
have
the
state
unilaterally
requiring
retailers
to
impose
a
12
percent
markup.
there
is
simply
no
concerted
action
between
any
parties,
and
indeed
throughout
the
argument
by
both
appellant
and
by
the
solicitor
general
they
have
pointed
to
no
agreement,
to
no
concerted
actions,
to
no
combinations
between
the
private
parties.
the
second
independent
ground
to
affirm
is
that
the
state
legislature's
direct
imposition
of
the
price
restraint
is
ipso
facto
immune
under
hoover,
and
a
third
ground
to
affirm
is
that
the
state
acted
pursuant
to
its
core
constitutional
power
under
the
21st
amendment
to
structure
a
liquor
distribution
system
to
meet
its
perceived
local
needs.
liquor--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--in
midcal
the
court
did
assume
a
violation
when
it
was
discussing
the
sherman--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--discussing
the
21st
amendment.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
no,
it
reached
a
decision
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
when
it
was
discussing
the
21st
amendment
it
was
discussing
it
in
the
context
of
a
violation.
liquor
is
different.
liquor
is
different
from
any
other
commodity,
because
it
is
the
only
commodity
singled
out
by
the
constitution
for
special
treatment.
it
is
a
specific,
express
grant
of
constitutional
power
to
states
to
regulate
liquor.
there
is
one
basic
theme
that
runs
through
every...
has
run
through
every
21st
amendment
case
since
adoption,
which
is,
the
state
has
wide
latitude,
indeed,
virtually
complete
control
over
how
to
structure
its
liquor
distribution
system
within
its
borders.
there
is
no
need
in
this
case
to
balance
the
state's
exercise
of
its
core
constitutional
power
against
any
other
federal
interest,
because
there
is
no
conflict
with
any
other
part
of
the
constitution.
there
is
no
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--if
this
court
does
consider
that
there
is
a
violation
then
it
would
engage
in
balancing
under
the
method
set
forth
in
justice
brennan's
unanimous
opinion
in
capital
cities
where
the
state's
interests
are
closely
related
to
its
21st
amendment
power.
the
state's
regulation
may
prevail,
notwithstanding
that
its
requirements
directly
conflict
with
express
federal
policy,
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
we
have
an
exercise
of
the
state's
core
power
under
the
21st
amendment,
as
this
court
has
reiterated--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--in
midcal
this
court
gave
great
weight
to
the
state
court's
conclusions
about
state
law
and
the
state
interest
as
well
as
great
deference
to
the
factual
findings
of
the
california
court
because
that
is
what
it
does
in
the
absence
of
exceptional
circumstances.
here
the
state,
contrary
to
the
situation
in
california,
new
york
state's
highest
court,
has
found
that
the
minimum
markup
statute
advances
an
important
public
policy.
it
pointed
to
legislative
findings.
the
state
acted
in
response
to
21st
amendment
concerns
to
structure
its
liquor
distribution
system,
and
the
state
balanced
that
important
public
policy
being
served
by
the
statute
against
the
federal
interest
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
came
to
the
directly
contrary
conclusion,
and
applying
the
same
method
of
analysis
that
this
court
did
in
midcal
this
court
would
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
the
state
court
was
correct
in
its
interpretation
of
its
state
interest.
it
is
quite
different
from
midcal,
where
the
california
court
came
to
a
completely
different
view
about
the
importance
of
its
statutory
scheme,
because
there
it
found
that
the
statute
was
contrary
to
public
policy.
it
found
that
there
were
alternative
means
such
as
below
cost
statutes.
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here
to
achieve
the
same
goal.
it
found
that
it
would
not...
that
the
method
that
california
chose
would
not
advance
its
purposes,
but
here
it
is
a
completely
different
situation.
and
the
court--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--the
state
can
meet
its
statutory
goals
under
a
simple
minimum
markup.
it
could
choose
a
variety
of
means,
but
it
doesn't--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--there
is
nothing
directly
in
the
record
on
the
necessity
for
the
bulletin.
the
bulletin
introduced
a...
perhaps
a
needed
element
of
flexibility
at
the
wholesale
level
in
what
would
be
otherwise
a
rigid
pricing
system,
but
that
is
well
within
the
state's
core
powers
under
the
21st
amendment
to
structure
a
liquor
distribution
as
it
sees
fit.
it
can
choose
a
monopoly.
it
can
choose
to
sell
liquor
by
the
drink.
it
can
sell
it
in
package
stores.
it
can
choose
the
places
and
the
times.
it
can
limit
the
number
of
locations
or
provide
unlimited,
or
it
can
choose
a
system,
as
new
york
did
here,
of
small
retailers
coexisting
with
large
ones.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
that
is
exactly
what
the
statute
is,
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
did
argue
in
our
brief,
that
this
is
exactly
like
minimum
markup
laws
in
other
states,
which
have
never
been
held
to
be
per
se
violations.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
exactly
and
that
is
exactly
the
argument
we--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--under
the
statute
it
is
directly
related
to
the
price
that
he
pays
with
the
only
difference
the
$1.92
per
case
breakage
charge,
but
that
is
a
statutory
formula
that
new
york
used
under
its
markup
law,
just
as
each
state
with
a
minimum
markup
law
has
chosen
its
own
statutory
formula
for
defining
cost
and
which
factors
go
into
it.
all
are
equally
artificial.
there
is
nothing--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--under
the
statute
it
bears
a
direct
relationship
as
distinct
from
the
bulletin.
it
prepares
an--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--under
the
statute
the
bottle
price
and
the
case
price
are
the
same
except
for
the
imposition
of
a
breakage
charge.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
which
is
a
charge
for
opening
a
case
to
sell
by--
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
--well,
the
bulletin
and
the
statute
should
be
considered
distinctly
because
we
have
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute
and
we
have
an
as
applied
attack.
the
as
applied
attack
is
simply
based
on
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
bulletin,
which
is
an
entirely
separate
issue.
it
is
true
that
under
the
bulletin
the
wholesaler
does
have
some
ability
to
effect
the
component
of
the
price.
it
is
different
from
the
statute,
which
is
a
simple
minimum
markup.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
colgate.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
none
at
all.
mr.
christopher
keith
hall
the
result
below
was
correct
for
three
reasons.
the
result
below
was
correct
because
there
was
no
meeting
of
the
minds
under
the
statute
or
the
bulletin.
the
result
below
is
correct
because
the
state
directly
imposed
its
price
restraint
as
an
act
of
the
sovereign,
and
the
result
below
is
correct
because
the
state
acted
pursuant
to
its
core
constitutional
powers
over
which...
to
structure
a
liquor
distribution
system
to
address
what
it
perceived
as
flaws
in
the
market
and
correcting
its
failures
and
aiding
its
victims.
thank
you.
