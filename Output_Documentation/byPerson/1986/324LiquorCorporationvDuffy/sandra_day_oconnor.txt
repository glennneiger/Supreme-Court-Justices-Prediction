mr.
kantor,
is
it
your
position
that
the
21st
amendment
will
never
justify
a
state
interest
in
the
protection
of
retailers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
21st
amendment
you
would
concede
that
a
state
could
properly
protect
retailers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
much
more
of
a
record
here
than
in
midcal
of
an
effect
of
helping
retailers.
there
just
wasn't
that
kind
of
a
record
in
midcal,
was
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
halls
do
you
thinks
for
instance,
a
state
could
pass
a
law
telling
all
steel
producers
that
they
had
to
charge
the
price
as
set
by
u.s.
steel
and
just
conduct
a
complete
end
run
around
the
sherman
antitrust
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
seems
to
be
the
thrust
of
your
argument,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
an
agreement
by
private
parties
is
necessary.
how
can
a
state
enact
a
law
that
tells
everybody
else
they
have
to
charge
the
price
fixed
by
one
individual
out
in
the
marketplace.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
think
there
is
a
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
midcal
didn't
seem
to
treat
it
as
part
of
the
core
power
in
its
discussion,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
state
have
met
its
goal
of
helping
retailers
by
having
simply
a
minimum
markup
statute
in
place?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
anything
in
the
record
then
to
justify
the
additional
provision
in
new
york
for
the
price
maintenance
scheme
as
opposed
to
a
minimum
markup?
