mr.
donald
e.
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
behalf
of
the
town
of
newton,
new
hampshire,
i
appear
before
you
today
because
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
bernard
rumery
reached
an
agreement
in
conjunction
with
the
dismissal
of
a
valid
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
mr.
rumery
agreed
that
he
would
not
pursue
a
civil
action
against
the
town,
the
arresting
officer,
or
any
of
the
town's
public
servants.
subsequently,
mr.
rumery
breached
that
agreement.
the
federal
district
court,
justice
martin
laughlin,
ruled
that
mr.
rumery's
agreement
should
be
enforced.
the
court
specifically
found
that
mr.
rumery
voluntarily,
knowingly
and
deliberately
waived
his
right
to
bring
a
subsequent
action
and
that
when
he
did
so,
he
did
so
thinking
and
knowing
that
it
was
in
his
best
interest.
mr.
rumery
now
seeks
to
escape
the
consequences
of
his
agreement
by
asking
this
court
to
apply
a
per
se
prohibition
against
the
type
of
agreement
that
he
entered
on
that
day
in
1983.
if
the
court
accepts
the
arguments
offered
by
mr.
rumery
and
allows
him
to
revoke
his
agreement,
then
this
court
not
only
will
be
providing
mr.
rumery
with
a
benefit
but
will
also
be
denying
all
present
and
future
defendants
in
a
situation
like
mr.
rumery,
they
will
in
effect
be
prevented
from
taking
upon
themselves
an
opportunity
like
that
which
was
presented
by
mr.
rumery.
i
therefore
suggest
to
the
court
that
application
of
a
per
se
rule
in
this
case
offends
common
sense,
basic
justice,
and
fair
play.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
the
difference
being--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--if
in
fact
it
were
overreaching,
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
the
suggestion
that
a
blackmailer
in
the
town
might
be
engaging
in
a
similar
type
of
conduct
as
regards
this
type
of
a
situation,
i
would
suggest,
is
not
appropriate.
this
is
a
case
where
the
county
attorney,
as
opposed
to
a
town...
an
actual
town
representative...
entered
in
to
an
agreement
when
he
was
concerned
about
a
prosecution,
concerned
about
the
principal
witness,
the
complaining
witness,
and
the
fact
that
she
was
also
the
victim
of
a
rape
and
that
she
may
not
be
willing
to
testify
in
this
subsequent
action,
he
entered
into
an
agreement
at
that
point
in
time
to
dismiss
the
prosecution,
conditioned
upon
the
police
officer,
the
public
servants,
and
the
town
being
somewhat
protected,
or
being
protected
against
a
civil
action.
this
is
a
case
where
a
man
made
a
voluntary,
knowing
and
deliberate
choice.
this
is
a
case
where
a
man
gave
up
a
right
to
a
civil
remedy,
and
it's
a
case
that
i
would
suggest,
also--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--he
had
a
choice.
he
chose
not
to
stand
trial
on
a
criminal
charge,
but
in
a
sense
chose
to
have
his
day
in
court
when
he
had
nothing
to
lose,
apparently,
be
reneging
on
his
agreement
and
thereafter--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--commonly,
i
would
expect
that
a
defendant
who
is
assured
of
his
innocence
will
do
that.
i
expect
in
a
plea
bargain
situation--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--well,
i
would
expect,
justice
stevens,
that
that's
very
similar
to
the
plea
bargaining
situation
and
we
see
people
who
stand
trial
despite
plea
bargain
offers
on
a
daily
basis.
i
would
suggest
in
that
situation--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--well,
there
are
plea
bargains
which
are
very
near
total
exoneration,
situations
in
new
hampshire,
for
instance,
where
an
individual
can
plead
to
a
lesser
included
misdemeanor
and
suffer
a
conditional
discharge
which
allows
him
an
automatic
annulment
of
his
record
in
one
year.
if
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--it
is
certainly
not
going
to
jail,
for
instance,
and
it's
something
that
if
it
were
done
in
this
case,
we
would
not
be
here
today
over.
i'm
not
suggesting
particularly
that
mr.
rumery
would
or
would
not
have
entered
into
an
agreement
like
that.
but
i
am
suggesting
that
the
distinction
between
that
and
what
happened
in
this
case
is
not
all
that
great
and
that
in
effect
all
that's
happened
here
is,
the
state
has
given
up
a
criminal
prosecution
but
in
doing
so,
in
a
case
involving
arrest,
a
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
arrest,
not
a
question
of
abuse
of
force,
a
question
of
arrest,
and
in
this
case
all
that
was
at
issue
was
whether
the
arrest
was
proper.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
if
you
give
$1,000
to
the
police
benefit
fund...
i
would
liken
that
to
the
blackmail
that
justice
scalia--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--well,
because
in
that
case
the
prosecutor
is
doing
something
that's
wholly
outside
his
ambit.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
he
has
a
duty
to
prosecute,
but
his
duty
is
not
solely
to
convict.
his
duty
is
to
serve
society
and
the
best
interests
of
society,
and
there
are
many
cases
that--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--not
as
directly
as
the
prosecutor's
activities
on
behalf
of
society
in
judging
whether
or
not
in
a
particular
case--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--well,
the
distinction,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
is
that
again
the
prosecutor
in
the
situation
where
he
garnered
$1,000
for
the
police
benefit
society
would
in
fact
be
outside
the
ambit
of
proper
prosecutorial
discretion,
whereas
in
this
situation,
i
would
suggest,
he
was
well
within
the
proper
area
of
prosecutorial
discretion.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
your
honor,
did
not...
the
is
no
evidence
that
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
demanded
a
release.
the
evidence
is
in
this
case
that
the
defending
attorney,
attorney
woods,
called
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
said,
you'd
better
dismiss
the
case
against
my
client
and
if
you
don't,
we're
going
to
sue
afterwards
and
we're
going
to
win.
he
then
knew,
having
thrown
down
the
gauntlet,
as
he
testified
to
in
his
deposition,
that
the
only
way
this
case
could
be
resolved
is
if
a
release
were
executed.
it's
important
to
realize
that
never
did
the
defendant
speak
with
the
police--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--it
was
not...
i
would
not
suggest
that
it
was
settled
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
meritorious
claim.
i
would
suggest
that
it
was
settled
on
the
assumption
that
any
claim
brought,
a
1983
claim
or
other,
a
false
arrest
state
claim,
has
a
settlement
value
in
that
it
causes
the
person
who
is
sued
a
considerable
inconvenience.
it
causes
the
person
against
whom
suit
is
brought
to
have
to
defend
that
action.
the
cost--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--because
the
police
officer
in
the
criminal
justice
system
is
a
public
servant.
the
prosecutor
is
acting
on
behalf
of
the
state.
the
police
officer,
when
he
arrested
mr.
rumery,
was
not
making...
he
was
not
taking
action
on
his
own
behalf.
he
was
acting
for
the
state.
he
was,
in
effect,
an
agent
of
the
state.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
bringing
the
1983
action,
the
plaintiff
must
so
plead,
that
he
was
a
state
actor.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
not
all
cases
have
a
dollar
settlement
value
on
account
of
their
inherent
value.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
was
suggesting
that
i
have
a
file
cabinet
full
of
releases
in
cases
which
i
don't
believe
are
meritorious,
that
have
been
settled
because
the
settlement
value...
the
nuisance
value
of
the
case--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--well,
a
dollar
settlement
value,
as
i
understand
it,
if
this
were
a
case
that
were
being
pursued,
would
run
to
mr.
rumery
rather
than
vice
versa.
i
think
your
example
suggests
that
mr.
rumery
is
going
to
pay
money
to
the
state.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
and
he
is
also...
he
is
voluntarily
waiving
something
which
he
knows,
because
he
has
been
advised
by
counsel,
he's
thought
about
it.
in
fact,
in
mr.
rumery's
case
his
counsel
testified
that
he
spent
a
half
hour
to
an
hour
with
him.
they
discussed
it.
he
went
home.
he
thought
about
it
over
the
weekend.
he
was
gaining
something
in
return.
he
was
gaining
the
dismissal
of
the
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
in
the
plea
bargaining
context,
he's
obviously
pleading
to
a
reduced
offense,
even
to
the
point
of
a
reduced
offense
that
is
perhaps
not
going
to
cause
him
any
disability
for
any
great
period
of
time
into
the
future.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
in
our
case
there
were
several
motives,
i
think.
i
think
it's
appropriate
prosecutorial
discretion
to
look
at
the
situation,
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
determine
whether
it
was
voluntary,
just,
deliberate.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
the
factor
in
determining
whether
to...
well,
that
should
be
a
factor.
i
think
it's
appropriate
and
it's
within...
it
should
be
within
his
discretion
that
that
be
a
factor,
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
when
he...
because
what
he's
effectively
doing,
in
an
arrest
case--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--if
that
were
the
only
factor.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
would
suggest
that
if
that
were
the
factor--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--i
would
suggest
that
if
that
were
the
only
factor,
justice
white,
what
we
would
be
talking
about
is
a
coercive
situation,
inherently
coercive,
and
i
would
trust
the
trial
court
to
find
that
it
wasn't
a
voluntary
waiver.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
if
it's
the
only
factor,
i
would
suggest
that
in
that
particular
case,
it
was
clearly
a
coercive
situation.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
it
would
otherwise
have
been
tried.
i
don't
know...
in
fact,
the
prosecutor
said,
if
there
had
not
been
a
release,
i
don't
know
what
i
would
have
done.
there
hadn't
even
been
a
probable
cause
hearing
in
this
case.
this
man
had
been
arrested
and
bailed,
and
that
was
it.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
well,
if
there's
going
to
be
a
per
se
rule,
then
obviously
that's
what
we
have
to
do.
the
court
is
either
going
to
have
to
presume
that
all
of
the
cases
would
have
been
dismissed
or
not
dismissed,
and
that's
the
difficult--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
this
court
have
faith
in
the
prosecutors
of
america
and
assume
that
those
cases,
if
they
were
not
meritorious,
would
have
been
dismissed
despite
the
release,
or
the
obtaining
of
a
release.
i
would
suggest
also,
your
honor,
that
in
an
arrest--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
he
was
getting
out
of
a
meritless
criminal
trial,
just
because
the
prosecutor
determines
that
he's
not
going
to
prosecute
the
case.
prosecutors
have
compassion.
mr.
rumery
was
a
middle
aged
man.
he
was
a
businessman.
he
had
a
reputation.
he
had
had
no
contacts
with
the
law.
the
prosecutor
was
concerned
that
in
this
case
the
complaining
witness
might
not
be
willing
to
testify.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i'm
not
a
prosecutor,
your
honor,
but
i
would
suggest
that
there
are--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--many
cases,
that
have
merit
are
never
brought.
many
cases
that
are
merited
cases
are
dismissed.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i'm
saying
that
in
each--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
each
case
you
have
to
look
at
the
case
when
the
decision
has
to
be
made,
and
determine
whether
at
that
time
the
situation
resulted
from
a
voluntary,
knowing,
deliberate
waiver
of
the
right
to
bring
the
action
by
the
individual.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
well,
that
certainly
could
happen,
and
it's
obvious
that--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--to
my
understanding,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
to
my
understanding,
your
honor,
the
first
circuit
applied
federal
law--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--in
that
i'm
very
pleased
because
they
decided
the
case
against
me,
your
honor.
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
the
law
here
is
a
question
of
public
policy,
as
was
suggested
below,
and
what
the
court
has
to--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--except
when
it
affects
constitutional
rights.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
there
is
a
suggestion,
or
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
first
amendment,
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances,
might
arguably
be
applied
and
the
suggestion
might
be
that
an
individual
who
waives
his
right
to
seek
redress
or
through
the
civil
rights
remedy
for
a
deprivation
of
his
constitutional
rights
has
in
effect
waived
his
right
to
petition
the
court
for
redress
of
grievances.
it
is
my
understanding
that
that
was
the
interpretation
of
the
first
circuit.
there
is
also
a
due
process
argument
to
the
effect
that
if
he
didn't
waive
it
voluntarily,
he
was
deprived
of
due
process.
the
fact
in
this
case,
and
the
fact
that
is
vital
to
this
case,
is
that
the
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
release
has
been
found
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
think,
in
order
to
determine
what
test
to
apply,
i
think
the
court
should
look
to
what
test
it
has
applied
in
interpreting
waivers
of
constitutional
rights.
and
if
you
look
to
the
constitutional
rights
cases,
the
miranda
cases,
the
plea
bargaining
cases,
you
see
that
in
each
of
those
cases
the
court
has
looked
to
the
question
of
whether
the
release
or...
excuse
me,
the
waiver
was
signed
or
agreed
to
after
informed
and
voluntary
consideration.
so,
i
would
suggest
that,
given
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
a
trial
court
be
trusted
to
examine
the...
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say,
justice
scalia.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
think
that
it's
important
to
look
at--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--i
think
that's
coercive.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
agree,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
trial
court
is
the
best
court
to
determine
that,
and
the
best
way
to
have
that
determined
is
to
give
the
trial
court
the
latitude
to
look
at
whether
the
release
was
signed
voluntarily
after
deliberation
and
in
an
informed
manner.
we
have
to
recall
that
mr.
rumery
in
this
case
deliberated
over
the
weekend,
that
mr.
rumery
had
the
advice
of
a
very
competent
attorney,
as
found
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
there
are
three
prongs
to
the
test,
and
i
would
suggest
that
is
not
voluntary.
i
would
suggest
that
any
time
circumstances
are
coercive...
i
would
suggest,
for
instance,
in
a
situation
unlike
this
case
where
a
substantial
amount...
or
any
undue
force
was
used
on
a
criminal
defendant
in
the
course
of
his
arrest
or
subsequent--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--the
man
who
refuses
to
accept
a
plea
to
second
degree
and
stands
trial
to
murder
in
the
first
degree,
stands
a
substantial
risk
of
capital
punishment
in
some
states.
i'd
say
that's
an
extreme
harm,
which
this
court
has
found
to
be
an
acceptable
situation
in
plea
bargaining
cases
where
the
court
has
found
that
it
was
voluntary
and
informed.
and,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
those
are
the
tests
that
must
be
applied
in
these
cases,
and
that
no
blanket
prohibition
is
appropriate.
after
all,
justice
holmes,
i
think,
is
the
one
who
said,
universal
distrust
creates
universal
incompetence.
and
i
would
suggest
that
a
per
se
blanket
rule--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--i
urge
the
court
not
to
find
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case.
i
would
suggest
that
there
has
been
none.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
by
the
first
circuit's
opinion,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--in
that
it
found
that
a
per
se
rule
would
be
applied
in
every
case,
and
our
facts
in
this
case
demonstrate--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--that
denied
my
client
the
benefit
of
the
release
which
mr.
rumery
had
executed.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i'm
not
sure.
it's
our
contention
that--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
jurisdiction
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
accepts
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
respondent's
claim
that
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated,
and
the
court
accepted
cert
because
of
the
discrepancy
of
the
decisions
of
the
various
circuits
on
this
question.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
have
taken
the
position
that
my
client,
who
is
the
town
of
newton,
new
hampshire,
entered
into
an
agreement--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
rumery
says
the
contrary.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i'm
sorry.
it's
my
position
that
there
have
been
no
constitutional
rights
violated.
mr.
rumery
takes
the
contrary
position.
the
first
circuit
adopted
a
rule
which
says,
in
every
case
these
releases
are
going
to
be
held
void,
no
matter
what
the
facts
are,
and
i'm
here
to
tell
this
court
that
in
my
opinion...
and
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
facts
are
such,
in
our
case,
that
the
release
dismissing
agreement
should
be
enforced.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
the
first
circuit
didn't
reach
that.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
would
expect
so.
the
difficulty
is,
of
course,
that
in
the
particular
case
i
it
is
binding
as
to
the
state
law
claims,
it
creates
a
very
difficult
situation
because
then
he
can't
prove
the
false
arrest
in
the
state
tort
and
the
constitutional
violation
on
the
other
side
seems
to
want
to
follow
that,
at
least
in
my
mind,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
well,
the
first
circuit
determined
that
it
violated
mr.
rumery's
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
seek
redress
of
grievances
by
virtue
of
his
signing
this
document.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
i
would
certainly
suggest,
your
honor,
that
it
was
briefed
on
both
sides
and--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--and
which
both
sides
took
as
a
finding
that
under
the
first
amendment,
he
was
entitled.
i
suppose
that
we're
guilty
on
both
sides
of
assuming
that
that
was
the
basis
of
the
first
circuit's
finding.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
well,
again
i'm
in
the
unusual
circumstance
of--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
it's
our
position
that
nothing
that
happened
here
is
inappropriate,
and
it's
our
position
that
the
best
way
to
determine
whether
something
inappropriate
happened
is
to
let
each
case
stand
on
its
own,
to
trust
the
prosecutor
to
do
a
good
job,
to
trust
the
trial
court
to
do
a
good
job,
and
then
to
trust
the
individual,
mr.
rumery,
to
do
a
good
job
and
determine
for
himself
whether
it's
just,
whether
he
ought
to
enter
into
the
agreement.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
thank
you.
just
briefly,
your
honor.
since
justice
frankfurter
in
his
absence
is
getting
a
lot
of
air
time
today,
i
thought
i'd--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--impart
a
bit
of
his
wisdom
in
this
case
also.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
he
said
in
adams,
a
case
that
was
decided
in
1942,
adams
versus
the
united
states,
that
to
imprison
a
man
and
his
privileges...
or
to
say
that
a
man
cannot
voluntarily
waive
his
constitutional
rights
is
to
imprison
a
man
and
his
privileges
and
call
it
the
constitution.
obviously,
a
man
has
to
be
able
to
choose
to
waive
his
constitutional
rights.
otherwise
his
rights
are,
in
a
sense,
not
really
good
to
him.
and
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
it's
quite
clear
in
this
case
that's
what
happened.
the
court
so
found,
he
voluntarily
waived
his
right.
the
court
also
found
that
at
the
time--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--it
certainly
suggests,
your
honor,
that
in
the
best
exercise
of
your
rights
you
ought
to
be
able
to,
on
occasion,
waive
them.
obviously
there
are
public
interest
limitations
at
the
very
extremes
to
that
kind
of
an
application.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
and
obviously
that
is,
but
in
this
case
we
don't
have
a
man
who
sold
himself
into
slavery.
we
have
a
man
who
gave
up
money,
as
the
court
aptly
pointed
out.
you
know,
my
opponent
suggests
to
the
court
that
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is
that
this
man
has
been
deprived
of
his
constitutional
rights.
but
what
we
all
realize
is
that
if
instead
of
signing
a
release
he
got
a
check,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
well,
if
the
prosecutor's
conduct
was
coercive,
then
the
release
wouldn't
be
voluntary.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--no.
if
he
threatened
to
go
on
with
the
prosecution
solely
in
order
to
coerce
the
release,
i
would
suggest
that
that's
clearly
coercive.
in
this
case
the
prosecutor
never
spoke
to
mr.
rumery
at
all.
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
no.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
we're
talking
about
a
prosecutor
who
has
good
cause
within
his
discretion
for
other
reasons
to
dismiss
a
case--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--well,
i
wouldn't
suggest
that's
good
cause,
but
for
reasons
other--
mr.
donald
e.
gardner
--reasons
other
than
guilt
or
innocence,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
reasons
other
than
guilt
or
innocence.
prosecutorial
discretion,
as
this
court
knows,
is
very,
very
broad.
and
the
reason
it's
very,
very
broad--
