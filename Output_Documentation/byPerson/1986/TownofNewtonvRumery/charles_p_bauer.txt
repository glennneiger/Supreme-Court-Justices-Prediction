mr.
charles
p.
bauer
i
certainly
will,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
that's
correct.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
represent
mr.
bernard
e.
rumery,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
and
we
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision.
with
regard
to
the
constitutional
source
of
law
that
has
been
inquired,
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
the
individuals
fourth
amendment
rights,
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
those
rights
have
been
violated
as
to
the
merits,
the
underlying
merits
of
this
litigation.
furthermore,
there
are
significant
1983
rights
which
have
been
prevented,
chilled
by
the
use
of
this
covenant
not
to
sue.
i
am
hopeful
that
that
speaks
to
the
underlying
constitutional
requirement
that
brings
this
issue
before
the
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
specifically,
your
honor,
the
fourth
amendment;
that
is,
the
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
including
the
unreasonable
arrest,
the
tension,
intimidation
and
coercion
that
was
used
against
this
individual
by
an
agent
or
an
arm
of
the
state
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
with
regard
to
the
underlying
merits,
your
honor,
yes.
but
we
are
not
here
for
the
underlying
merits
of
this
case.
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
constitutional
violation
of
this
man's
rights
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
that
is
a
jury
determination
and
we
are
not--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--yes.
your
honor...
well,
we
have
not
had
a
trial
as
of
yet.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
take
a
few
moments
just
to
go
through
some
of
the
facts
of
the
underlying
case
that
may
put
the
case
in
perspective,
if
i
may.
mr.
rumery
is
a
rock-solid
citizen
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
he
has
lived
all
of
his
life
in
a
small
new
england
town,
in
new
hampshire.
he
was
an
insurance
agent
and
married,
and
never
having
any
prior
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system.
he
was
arrested
for
tampering
with
a
witness
in
an
underlying
rape
case.
he
was
arrested
and
charged
with
a
class
b
felony
for
tampering
with
a
witness,
which
in
new
hampshire
brings
a
maximum
of
seven
years'
imprisonment.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
no,
your
honor.
it
would
make
no
difference
at
all.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
yes,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
the
clash
of
using
the
criminal
justice
system
to
extract
a
civil
benefit
for
third
party
interests
is
void,
as
against
public
policy,
as
a
matter
of
law.
so,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
this
is
a
felony,
underlying
felony,
or
misdemeanor
charge.
now,
prior
to
the
arrest--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--no,
your
honor.
you
do
not
look
to
state
law.
you
look
to
federal
law.
you
look
specifically
to
the
intent
of
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
which
provides--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--no,
your
honor,
no.
if
state
law
would
require
two
witnesses,
this
issue
still
is
meritorious
under
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
yes,
your
honor.
the
reason
it
is
federal
law
is
because
it's
not
federal
contract
law.
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
it
is
federal
contract
law.
what
i
mean
to
suggest
is
that
the
rights
afforded
under
1983
protect
federal
rights
articulated
through
the
constitution,
and
if
there
is
a
waiver
of
those
rights
through
an
inherently
coercive--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--yes.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
a
direct
waiver
of
constitutional
rights.
it
is,
i
think,
a
direct
waiver
of
the
right
of
an
individual
to
petition
his
or
her
government
to
have
his
or
her
day
in
court,
to
at
least
go
to
a
jury
to
decide
whether
his
or
her
individual
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
been
violated
or
not.
and,
if
you
have
the
state,
through
the
arm
of
the
state,
that
is
the
prosecution
or
the
police
taking
away
that
right,
i
think
it
is
a
direct
deprivation.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
no,
your
honor.
only
in
the
individual
situation
where
an
individual,
prior
to
conviction,
is
presented
with
the
dilemma
of
giving
up
civil
rights,
federally
guaranteed
civil
rights,
in
exchange
for
a
nolle
pros,
or
dismissed
with
criminal
charges.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
it
really
does
not,
i
don't
believe.
it
does
in
the
context
of
pre-conviction
release
dismissal
practices.
i
will
submit
that
this
practice,
although
not
widely
reported
in
the
appellate
decisions,
this
practice
is
apparently
being
utilized
to
a
fair
extent.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
what's
so
bad
about
it?
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
what's
so
bad
about
this
is
that
the
public
interest
is
being
subverted,
your
honor.
the
public
interest
of--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--that
may
be,
yes.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
that
is
what
i'm
talking
about.
that's
one
of
the
public
interests
that's--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--yes,
your
honor.
once
the
prosecutor
makes
a
decision
to
nolle
pros
a
criminal
charge,
regardless
of
the
underlying
reasons
once
that
decision
has
been
made
that
this
case
does
not
warrant
criminal
prosecution,
with
the
interest
of
the
public
in
mind,
then
we
say
it
is
improper
for
that
prosecutor
to
refuse
to
nolle
pros.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
the
reason
i
believe,
chief
justice,
that
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
is
that
in
addition
to
the
required
waiver
of
1983
rights
there
is
also
an
unequal
protection--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
agree
with
that.
there
is
a
clash
here
between
the
systems,
and
the
clash
is
the
use
of
the
criminal
justice
system
in
order...
against
the
individual
by
the
arm
of
the
state,
against
the
individual
to
extract
a
waiver
of
rights
for
the
benefit
of
not
the
public--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
required
to
go
beyond
for
the
purposes
of
deciding
this
case
and
deciding
whether
this
covenant
is
void
as
against
public
policy.
i
don't
believe
that
it's
necessary
to
do
beyond.
but,
yes,
i
agree
with
you,
justice
stevens,
that
the
first
circuit
identified
the
covenant
not
to
sue
as
void
as
against
public
policy,
and
stopped
right
there.
it
did
not
go
on
to
speak
to
the
pendant
state
claims.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
my
position
is
that
if
the
covenant
not
to
sue
deprives
an
individual
of
federally
guaranteed
rights
to
petition
a
court
for
redress,
to
be
treated
fairly
and
equally
under
the
law,
to
have
his
liberty
interests
adjudicated
by
a
jury,
if
that
is
the
ultimate
decision
or
impact
of
the
covenant
not
to
sue,
then
yes.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
within
this
context,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
within
this
context,
yes.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
well--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--i
just
want
to
make
sure--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--well--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--yes,
you
do.
you
are
forced
to.
you
are
forced
to
under
this
circumstance.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
you
shouldn't...
yes,
you
can't
be
forced
by
the
government
to
give
up
those
rights,
yes.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
well,
i'm
glad
you
asked
that.
you
are
forced
to
because
the
prosecutor
and
the
police,
having
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
ranging
from
arrest
all
the
way
through
punishment,
has
an
inherently
unequal
bargaining
position
and
that's
the
way
that
you...
an
individual
is
forced.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
no.
the
way
you
remedy
that,
your
honor,
is
for
this
court
to
send
a
clear
signal
to
police
and
prosecutors
that
these
kinds
of
covenants
will
not
be
tolerated,
that
an
individual--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
the
significant
difference,
your
honor,
between
plea
bargaining
and
this
context
is
that
in
plea
bargaining
there
is
not
a
confusion
of
the
two
systems.
you
have
plea
bargaining
solely
within
the
criminal
context
and
there
is
a
mutuality
of
advantage
to
the
state
and
to
the
criminal
defendant.
moreover,
the
public
interest
in
the
plea
bargaining
situation,
the
public
interest
is
being
served.
that
is,
there
is...
the
state
is
obtaining
a
plea
to
a
guilty
charge
and
there
is
a
conviction
on
that
guilty
charge.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
most
of
what
you've
just
articulated,
justice,
are
valid.
however,
using
the
proper
discretion
that
you
just
described,
of
the
prosecutor,
he
or
she
may
nolle
pros
that
charge.
but
to
go
one
step
further,
and
to
say
to
the
individual,
now,
in
addition
to
my
public
interest
duty
which
has
been
served
in
weighing
whether
to
go
through
with
this
criminal
prosecution,
i
want
to
extract
from
you
your
right
to
sue
and
to
exercise
your
federal
rights.
my
position
is,
your
honor,
that
for
the
prosecutor
to
protect
individual
police
officers,
to
protect
individual
witnesses,
to
protect
the
municipality,
is
not
within
the
ambit--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
to
dismiss,
yes.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
yes.
if
he
or
she
uses
proper
prosecutorial
discretion
to
dismiss.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
the
civil
case,
your
honor...
let
me
back
up
if
i
may.
the
public,
the
public
interest
is,
if
there
has
been
a
misuse
of
public
official
action,
the
public
interest
has
an
interest
in
exposing
that
misconduct
to
the
air
of
light
and
to
correct
it
if
necessary.
furthermore--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
he
can
take
those
things
into
consideration
but
he
cannot
take
into
consideration
whether
i
should
get
a
civil
release
in
order
to
protect
my--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--your
honor,
i
would
respond
by
saying
that
there
are
already
safeguards
for
police,
prosecutors,
towns.
we
have
absolute
immunity
in
some
circumstances.
we
have
qualified
immunity
in
other
circumstances.
we
have
good
faith
defenses,
and
it
is
not
the
proper
role
of
the
prosecutor--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--your
honor,
if
only
the
waste
of
time
is
the
consideration,
then
it's
our
position
that
that
is
not
a
proper
prosecutorial
decision
because
that
so-called
waste
of
time
does
not
serve
the
public,
does
not
serve
the
public.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
your
honor,
i
would
tend
to
agree
with
you
that
that
particular
aspect,
that
issue
or
sub-issue,
does
not
really
cry
to
this
court
for
adjudication.
but
it
is
crafted
onto
the
issue
of
federally
guaranteed
rights,
civil
rights
versus
the
threat
of
hanging
in
criminal
prosecution
or
a
nolle
pros
over
an
individual's
head.
i
would
submit
that
what
individual,
faced
with
that
dilemma,
facing
the
criminal
charge
on
the
one
hand
and
giving
up
civil
rights
with
a
nolle
pros
on
the
other
hand,
what
individual
would
not
sign
such
a
covenant?
i
submit
that
each
and
every
one
of
us
would
sign
and--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--your
honor,
not
if
he
was
innocent.
there
are
certainly
risks
and
uncertainty.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--certainly
in
the
civil
context,
we
have,
your
honor,
where
one
civil--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--your
honor,
what
i'm
asking
for
is
not
whether
an
individual
may
or
may
not
sign
a
covenant.
what
i
am
asking
this
court
to
declare
is
that
the
state,
through
the
police
and
prosecutor,
can't
use
that
as
a
threat,
the
dropping
of
a
criminal
charge
as
a
threat
to
extract
the
covenant
not
to
sue.
that's
the
process
that
i
see.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
didn't
hear
the--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--your
honor,
i
did
not
represent
the
respondent
in
the
criminal
charge
below.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
to
the
best
of
the
recollection
of
the
criminal
defense
attorney,
it
is
his
belief
that
the
prosecutor
first
brought
up
the
subject.
but
there
is
question
about
that.
neither
individual,
neither
the
prosecutor
or
a
criminal
defense
attorney,
can
actually
remember
who
actually
brought
it
up
first.
but
the
criminal
defense
attorney's
best
recollection
is
that
the
state
brought
it
up
first.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
your
honor,
mr.
rumery
had
no
other
choice
and
mr.
rumery's
criminal
defense
attorney
had
no
other
choice.
what
other
recommendation
would
his
criminal
defense
attorney
give,
other
than
to
say,
"bernie,
sign
it".
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
conviction,
if
there
is
a
conviction
or
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
charge
with
restitution
as
part
of
the
punishment--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--no,
your
honor,
because
in
that
hypothetical
the
individual
is
not
being
forced
to
waive
his
federal
rights
to
sue,
under
1983,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
no,
we're
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
besides
money,
your
honor,
the
public
has
an
interest
in
that
1983
action.
if
in
fact
there
was
misconduct,
the
public
has
an
interest
of
exposing
that
misconduct
and
correcting
it,
and
the
public
also
has
the
interest
to
give
this
individual
his
or
her
day
in
court,
to
petition
his
government
for
redress
if
in
fact
his
government
has
caused
him
civil
harm.
so,
it
is
not
just--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--no,
there
is
not,
your
honor...
after
the
finding
of
guilty,
yes,
but--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--and
winning
it,
yes,
and
we
submit
that
the
prosecutor...
if
this
court
does
not
declare
such
covenants
void,
that
the
prosecutors
and
police
will
incorporate
this
type
of
covenant
into
their
standard
operating
procedure
and
thereby
prevent...
virtually
prevent
any
1983
action--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
district
court,
i
think
that
you're
referring
to
the
sorting
out,
to
the
trial
level.
we
submit
that
when
you
have
the
clash
of
the
criminal
justice
system
being
used
against
an
individual
to
extract
a
civil
benefit,
there
cannot
be
a
voluntary
waiver.
so,
therefore,
there
is
no
need
to
even
go
through
the
ad
hoc,
case
by
case
balancing.
i
would
also,
by
analogy,
suggest
that
a
private
attorney--
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
--no,
because
the
voluntary,
deliberate
and
informed
standard,
your
honor,
only
looks
to
the
individual.
did
he
have
time
to
think
about
it?
did
he
deliberate?
was
he
informed?
did
he
have
a
criminal
defense
attorney?
was
it
voluntary?
our
position
is
that
once
you
have
the
threat
of
the
criminal
justice
system
being
used
to
extract
the
civil
benefit,
it
cannot
be
voluntary.
the
voluntary,
deliberate
standard
does
not
look
to
the
motives
of
the
prosecutor.
it
does
not
look
to
the
conduct
of
the
police
department.
it
only
looks
to
the
individual.
it's
only
one
side
of
the
equation.
and
our
position
is
that
with
that
imbalance,
with
that
unequal
bargaining
position,
such
a
covenant
cannot
as
a
matter
of
law
be
voluntary.
mr.
charles
p.
bauer
yes,
your
honor,
yes,
and
there
is
a
case
on
point
on
that
type
of
matter
where
a
trial
court
participated
in
that
request
for
a
stipulation
as
to
probable
cause.
and
i
believe
the
case
is
dixon
versus
d.c.,
1968,
when
chief
justice
bazelon
indicated
that
the
problem
with
these
covenants,
or
these
kind
of
tacit
agreements,
is
not
necessarily...
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
you
very
much
for
your
time.
