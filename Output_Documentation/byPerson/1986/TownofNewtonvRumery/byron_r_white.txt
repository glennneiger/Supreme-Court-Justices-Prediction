justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
the
motive
of
the
prosecutor,
or
the
reason--
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
determining
whether...
should
a
factor
in
determining
whether
to
dismiss
the
case
be
that
this
will
protect
some
public
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
that
means
to
me
is
that
you
would
otherwise
pursue
the
criminal
case
if
it
weren't
for
this
factor?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
but
if
you
say
it's
a
factor,
there
are
bound
to
be
some
cases
where
that's
the
factor
that
determines
whether
you
will
try
the
case
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that
you're
justified
in
trading
off
the
public
interest
in
having
this
criminal
case
tried,
against
releasing
the
public
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
it
can
always
be
a
factor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here's
a
case
where
you
had
otherwise
tried...
there
has
to
be
some
situations
like
this
that
you
would
otherwise
try,
but
you
did
not
because
there
is
this
factor
of
possibly
gaining
the
release
of
a
public
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
constitutional
issue...
did
the
first
circuit
decide
a
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
what's
so
bad
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
why
is
it
so
contrary
to
public
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
the
prosecutor
is
giving
up
a
perfectly
good
criminal
prosecution
that
he
shouldn't
give
up
just
in
order
to
protect
a
public
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
if
the
prosecutor
has
a
good
case,
he
might
put
your
client
in
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
--there
can
be
the
most
outrageous
violation
of
somebody's
fourth
amendment
rights
and
then
a
trial
at
which
he
is
found
guilty
and
there
isn't
much
you
can
do
about
the
false
arrest,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
prosecutor
can
protect
the
grossest
false
arrest
by
going
ahead
and
trying
the
case
and
winning
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
so,
not
so.
that
statement
must
rest
on
the
idea
that
it's
impossible
to
sort
out
the
good
ones
from
the
bad
ones.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
position.
i
know
that's
your
argument,
but
can't
you
really
identify
those
cases
where
there
might
be
prosecutorial
overreaching?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
solve
all
these
cases
by
the
voluntary
and
intelligent
formula,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
without
any
regard
at
all
to
the
prosecutor's
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
whenever
the
prosecutor's
got
a
lousy
case,
that
he'd
never
try
in
a
hundred
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
like
he
hasn't
got
any
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
one
of
the
best
reasons
known
to
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if...
well,
my
time
is
up.
[laughter]
