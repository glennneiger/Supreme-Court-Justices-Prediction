justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
it
say
that?
all
i
can
find
here
is
that
it
held
that
the
covenant
not
to
sue
was
void,
as
against
public
policy.
where
was
there
any
suggestion
that
it
was
void
under
the
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
had
been
briefed,
but
where
does
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
it
was
void,
the
covenant
was
void,
under
the
first
amendment?
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
cite
a
single
supreme
court
decision,
as
i
recall.
it
just
said
that
this
wasn't
a
good
defense
to
a
1983
action,
which
they
certainly
decided
federal
question
and
which--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--you
suggested
earlier,
did
you
not,
mr.
gardner,
that
there
was
perhaps
a
due
process
claim
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
adversary
should
be
arguing
this,
not
you,
i
guess.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
specifically,
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
