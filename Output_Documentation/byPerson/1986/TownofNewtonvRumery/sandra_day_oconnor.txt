mr.
gardner,
if
the
1983
suit
has
a
dollar
settlement
value,
how
is
the
case
different
from
just
having
the
police
say,
if
the
respondent
will
pay
the
city
$1,000
it
will
dismiss
the
charges?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
said
this
one
probably
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
suppose
there
is
a
dollar
settlement
value.
how
is
it
different
from
just
saying,
you
pay
us
"x"
number
of
dollars
and
we'll
drop
the
charges?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
he
is
giving
up
his
suit,
something
of
value.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
very
fact
something
that
makes
it
different
from
plea
bargaining
because
here
the
city
has
something
else
it's
concerned
about
other
than
just
the
operation
of
the
process
of
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law
in
reaching
this
agreement?
there's
another
element
at
stake,
to
wit,
the
city's
or
the
officer's
own
liability.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
matter
of
some
federal
contract
law
principle,
or
what?
the
defense
in
the
1983
action
raised
by
the
city
and
the
defendants
was
the
existence
of
a
valid
contractual
release.
so,
what
principles
govern
the
validity
of
that
release?
do
we
look
to
state
law,
or
the
validity
of
the
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
wait
a
minute,
1983
doesn't
create
the
federal
right.
it
provides
some
kind
of
a
statutory
remedy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
would
seen
to
me
that
what
was
at
issue
below
was
the
validity
of
a
covenant
or
agreement
viewed
in
terms
of
state
law.
this
isn't
a
direct
waiver
of
constitutional
rights.
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
anyway,
involves
a
covenant
to
give
up
some
statutorily
created
right
to
sue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bauer,
who
initiated
the
suggestion
of
dropping--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
this
case,
was
it
you
or
your
client
who
initiated
the
discussion
with
the
city
about
dropping
the
1983
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
respondent
or
his
then
lawyer
initiate
this
covenant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that
in
this
case,
at
least,
mr.
rumery
and
his
attorney
very
much
wanted
to
enter
into
the
agreement
and
thought
it
was
in
their
best
interest
to
do
so?
