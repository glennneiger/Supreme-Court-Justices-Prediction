justice
john
paul
stevens
he
also
gave
up
the
right
to
defend
himself
in
court,
too,
i
suppose.
the
thing
that
really
is
on
the
table
is
whether
he
wanted
to
stand
trial
on
a
criminal
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there
are
very
many
cases
in
which
the
defendant
would
say,
i'd
much
rather
go
to
trial
on
the
criminal
charge,
than
just
have
you
dismiss
the
charges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assured
of
his
innocence,
he'd
still
want
to
go
to
trial,
even
though
you
know
nothing
is
all
that
certain
in
trials?
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
are
a
choice
between
one
of
two
different
criminal
trials.
the
plea
bargain
is
never
one
where
you
get
total
exoneration
in
exchange
for
a
bargain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
still
fairly
serious.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
suppose
a
bargain
would
be
enforceable
if
the
prosecutor
said,
we'll
dismiss
the
charges
if
you
give
$1,000
to
the
police
benefit
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
that
any
different
from
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
he
has
a
duty
to
prosecute
if
he
thinks
there's
prima
facie
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think
the
police
benefit
fund
serves
society?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
here
you
can
settle
a
loss
to
it
for
less
than
$1,000,
if
it's
a
frivolous
case.
what's
the
difference?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--garnered
the
release
for
two
or
three
police
officers
who
otherwise
might
be
subjected
to
personal
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
it
was
settled
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
meritorious
1983
claim
that
would
otherwise
be
filed,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
inconvenience
to
the
individual
police
officer
any
different
from
the
benefit
to
my
police
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gardner,
i
think
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
per
se
rule
is
appropriate.
in
other
words,
what's
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
whole
file
cabinet
full
of
releases
you've
obtained
in
all
those
other
cases,
because
that's...
we
have
a
general
rule.
we
have
to
presume
that
all
of
those
other
cases
would
have
been
dismissed,
or
would
not
have
been
dismissed,
without
this
release?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
do
you
think
is
the
correct
presumption?
if
you've
got,
say
150
releases
in
your
drawer
and
dismiss
cases,
do
we
assume
there
was
merit
to
all
those
cases
or
no
merit
to
all
those
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
really,
there's
no
consideration
for
the
release
except
that
the
defendant
got
out
of
a
meritless
criminal
trial,
and
i
suppose
there's
a
lot
of
pressure
on
a
defendant
to
give
a
release
in
that
situation
if
he's
faced
with
a
trial,
even
if
he
thinks
he's
going
to
win.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
justice
scalia's
example,
i
suppose
that
if
the
lawyer
was
with
the
man
that
he'd
give
him
the
same
advice?
right,
he
turns
to
the
lawyer
and
he
says,
should
i
give
him
my
money
or
my
life?
the
lawyer
says,
give
him
the
money.
it's
an
intelligent
decision,
right,
and--
--and
it's
voluntary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
reason
the
holdup
is
involuntary
is
that
the
victim
runs
the
risk
of
substantial
harm
if
he
doesn't
hand
over
the
money,
and
a
man
who
elects
to
stand
trial
in
a
public
criminal
proceeding
may
also
run
the
risk
of
substantial
harm
to
his
reputation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gardner,
may
i
just
ask
this.
under
the
first
circuit
holding,
they
say
the
release
is
void.
is
that
just
as
to
the
1983
federal
claim?
what
about
the
ancillary
state
law
claims
for
malicious
prosecution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
that
one
could
view
the
opinion
as
allowing
those...
the
release
to
still
be
valid
and
binding
as
to
state
law
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bauer,
i
think
there
is
some
difference
between
your
position
and
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
i
read
their
opinion
as
merely
holding
that
the
waiver
was
unenforceable
as
to
the
1983
federal
claim,
but
it
said
nothing
that
persuaded
me
they
intended
to
hold
unenforceable
the
waiver
of
state
law
claims
such
as...
you
had
about
five
or
six
state
law
claims.
but
the
argument
you're
making
now,
that
there
is
a
constitutional
compulsion
to
hold
it
void
would
also
invalidate
the
entire
covenant
not
to
sue.
is
that
the
position
you
intend
to
maintain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
do
you
want
us
to
go
beyond
the
holding
of
the
first
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
one
can
read
their
decision
as
just
a
statutory
construction
decision,
thinking
this
is
necessary
to
make
the
remedy,
the
1983
remedy,
an
effective
federal
remedy.
your
position
is
a
much
broader
one
and
says
that
the
whole
covenant
is
unconstitutional,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
because
it
was
obtained...
i
don't
know,
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
your
theory
of
unconstitutionality.
don't
you
really
say
that
you
can
have
a
covenant
not
to
sue
for
everything
under
the
sky
except
1983?
isn't
that
what
your
position
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bauer,
suppose
instead
of
a
covenant
the
prosecutor
said
he
wanted
the
defendant
to
stipulate
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest,
even
though
he
wasn't
prepared
to
prove
that
the
man
was
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
presumably
in
this
case
there's
probable
cause
if
the
woman
told
the
police
officers
what
the
record
suggests.
would
that
kind
of
a
stipulation
as
to
the
facts
be
invalid,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
your
rule
would
cover
every
case,
you'd
say,
"well,
we've
got
everything
agreed
and
we're
going
to
dismiss;
the
one
last
thing,
you've
got
to
sign
this
release
before
we
do
it.
"
that
would
be
bad?
