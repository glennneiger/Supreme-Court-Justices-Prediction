justice
antonin
scalia
the
argument
that
you
are
preventing
future
people
from
engaging
in
it
is
not
terribly
persuasive.
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about,
if
you...
if
we
didn't
enforce
promises
made
to
blackmailers
we
would
be
denying
people
in
the
future
the
opportunity
to
prevent
blackmailers
from
doing
the
terrible
things
they
are
threatening
to
do
by
making
a
promise
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if,
indeed,
there
is
some
overreaching
here,
and
it
is
a
bad
thing
to
have
cities
or
anybody
doing
this
sort
of
thing...
it's
hardly
something
to
be
worried
about,
that
we're
preventing
it
from
happening
in
the
future.
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
can't
really
assume,
in
other
words,
that
all
the
cases
that
are
dismissed
are
necessarily
meritless
cases.
you
often
dismiss
cases
that
have
merit,
i
take
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
many
cases
that
have
merit
are
never
brought.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
case
that
has
merit
but
nonetheless,
despite
its
merit,
might
otherwise
be
dismissed
because
a
witness
would
have
to,
as
in
this
case,
a
woman
in
a
rape
case
who
didn't
want
to
testify
would
have
to
be
called,
that
otherwise
the
prosecutor
might
dismiss
the
case;
nonetheless
would
have
to
go
forward
to
it
despite
the
inconvenience
to
this
raped
witness,
unless
the
prosecutor
could
be
sure
that
by
dismissing
it,
he
was
not
letting
the
city
in
for
an
enormous
suit
for
false
prosecution.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
saying
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
motive
of
saving
the
city
from
a
suit,
or
individual
policemen
from
a
suit,
also
exist
when
a
prosecutor
accepts
a
plea
bargain
to
a
lesser
offense,
so
that
in
some
cases
where
the
prosecutor
might
otherwise
consider
dismissing
the
charge
entirely,
he
insists
upon
accepting
a
plea
to
a
lesser
charge
in
order
to
be
sure
that
the
city
wouldn't
be
subject
to
suit
for
false
prosecution
subsequently?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
pleading
guilty
to
a
lesser
included
offense
eliminate
the
possibility
of
bringing
a
false
arrest
or
false
prosecution
action
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
informed
or
voluntary.
you
know,
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
thief
comes
up
and
says,
your
money
or
your
life,
you
know,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
there
used
to
be
a
jack
benny
story,
and
he'd
say,
hmm,
you
know,
he'd
pause
for
a
couple
of
minutes.
you
don't
have
to
pause.
it's
informed
and
knowledgeable.
you
give
him
your
money.
but
does
that
make
it
all
right?
it
certainly
doesn't.
if
that's
the
kind
of
influence
that's
being
exerted
here,
it
has
to
be
bad,
whether
it's
intelligent
to
do
it
or
not,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
if
state
law
requires
two
witnesses
to
such
an
agreement,
we
could
simply
say,
you
don't
need
two
witnesses?
why?
this
is
not
an
agreement.
the
federal
government's
not
a
party
to
this
agreement
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
justice
o'connor's
question
didn't
go
to
this
issue,
as
i
understood
it.
it
went
to,
what
law
governs
the
contract
between
the
town
and
your
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
law...
you
assert
that's
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
state
would
argue
that
here
there's
a
public
interest
being
served
as
well,
that
the
prosecutor,
given
his
other
business,
has
decided
that
this
case,
on
reflection,
is
not
worth
his
resources.
so,
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
it
but
at
the
same
time
he
doesn't
want
to
leave
the
municipality
open
to
a
1983
suit.
that's
perfectly
reasonable.
or,
as
also
is
alleged
to
have
happened
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
has
decided
in
light
of
the
reluctance
of
the
rape
victim
to
testify,
justice
would
be
disserved
by
putting
her
through
all
that
and
going
ahead
with
this
proceeding.
why
aren't
those
valid
interest
of
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
want
him
to
say,
the
only
way...
and
he
can't
even
consider
that
in
deciding
to
go
ahead
with
the
prosecution?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can't
have
in
mind
that,
"if
i
don't
go
ahead...
i
think
it's
a
valid
prosecution
but
i
think...
you
know,
other
things
being
equal
i
would
think
it's
not
worth
doing
for
a
number
of
reasons,
one
of
which
is
i
have
better
things
to
do.
"
"nonetheless,
since
i'm
aware
that
if
i
dismiss
it
the
city
will
be
subjected
to
an
enormous
amount
of
suits.
"
do
you
expect
the
prosecutor
nonetheless
to
dismiss?
justice
antonin
scalia
without
bearing
in
mind
that
although
it's
a
meritorious
case
he's
going
to
have
to
litigate
this
thing
in
civil
matters?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
time
he's
saving
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
he's
losing
in
having
to
litigate
the
civil
case.
so,
he
saves
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
he
denies
that
there
has
been
any.
he
thinks
this
has
been
a
good
arrest,
a
good
prosecution,
and,
"if
i
went
ahead
with
it
i'd
win
it,
but
it's
not
worth
it.
"
"i
have
other
things,
and
there
is
a
rape
victim
that
has
expressed
her
reluctance
and
i
don't
want
to
put
her
through
the
wringer.
"
now,
he
can't
take
those
things
into
account,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
only
way
to
take
them
into
account,
and
the
only
way
to
protect
them
is
to
get
the
release.
because
the
rape
victim
doesn't
care
whether
she's
put
on
the
stand
in
a
criminal
prosecution
or
in
a
subsequent
civil
suit.
it's
going
to
be
just
as
bad
for
her.
and
his
time
is
going
to
be
as
much
wasted
in
the
civil
suit
as
it
would
be
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
so,
you're
just
telling
him
there's
really
no
way
that
he
can
do
anything
about
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
worried
about
his
waste
of
time.
you
tell
me
how
his
waste
of
time
is
preserved,
unless
he
gets
the
release.
he
has
just
decided,
"i
have
too
much
business.
"
"i
have
other
criminal
prosecutions
that
are
more
important.
"
"i'd
rather
dismiss
this
one.
"
"on
the
other
hand,
if
i
know
that
the
time
i
save
in
trying
the
criminal
case
is
going
to
be
wasted
in
a
civil
suit,
i'd
rather
try
the
criminal
case
and
get
this
guy
because
he
deserves
it.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
a
prosecutor
comes
up
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bauer,
what
about
the
situation
which
i
understand
is
pretty
frequent,
where
a
prosecutor
is
thinking
of
filing
an
assault
charge
against
an
individual
and
ultimately
it's
worked
out
that
the
prospective
defendant
agrees
to
pay
the
medical
expenses
of
the
party
that
was
injured,
and
if
he
does
so
the
whole
thing's
dropped?
now,
things
like
that
happen
all
the
time.
isn't
that
person
under
the
same
kind
of
compulsion,
shall
we
set
aside
those...
is
that
prosecutorial
misconduct
as
well?
i
mean,
is
there
any
way
to
avoid
this,
you
know,
what
you
say
is
hanging
over
the
head
of
the
defendant?
of
course
there's
something
hanging
over
his
head.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that's
not
the
deal.
the
deal
is,
look,
the
complainant
says,
"i'll
drop
the
charges".
and
the
prosecutor
says,
"i'll
drop
the
charges
if
you
pay
the
medical
expenses
that
this
guy
incurred.
"
now,
the
defendant
still
says,
"i
didn't
do
it,
but
nonetheless,
i'll
pay
the
expenses.
"
now,
isn't
that
the
same
kind
of
coercion?
should
all
of
those
things
be
viewed
disfavorably
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
only
talking
about
money
here,
aren't
we?
i
mean,
that's
all
we're
talking
about
is
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
he
going
to
get
in
his
1983
suit
besides
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
may
be
here,
mr.
gardner.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
really
believe...
that
is
an
exorbitant
argument.
what
about,
for
instance,
his
right
not
to
be
sold
into
slavery?
i
mean,
slavery's
been
outlawed.
are
you
saying
that
right
is
no
good
unless
he
can
sell
it,
right?
that
means
we
have
to
allow
slavery
in
this
country
because
otherwise
the
right
to
be
free
from
slavery
isn't
worth
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
your
opponent's
arguing.
