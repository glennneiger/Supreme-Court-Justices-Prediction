you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
gardner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gardner,
what
is
the
source
of
law
in
this
area?
you've
been
giving
a
lot
of
answers
and
you've
got
a
lot
of
questions.
is
it
federal
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
here
now
in
the
supreme
court.
you
don't
have
to
take
the
word
of
the
first
circuit
any
more.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
public
policy
is
ordinarily
a
matter
for
state
courts
to
decide
in
new
hampshire.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
the
source
of
law
here
the
federal
common
law,
basically
because
it's
a
1983
action,
like
immunity
in
1983
is
a
federal
law,
or
the
validity
of
a
release
is
also
a
federal
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
where
do
we
look?
are
there
other
lines
of
cases
that
you
think
are
relevant?
i
mean,
do
we
just
kind
of
sit
down
and
talk
about
it
and
think--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gardner.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
bauer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
covers
an
awful
lot
of
covenants
not
to
sue.
most
of
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
a
concern
of
federal
law,
to
encourage
the
prosecutor
that
way?
it
seems
to
me
the
concerns
of
federal
law
here
would
be
exhausted
when
you're
sure
that
the
putative
defendant
is
treated
fairly.
just
like
in
an
fela
release
case,
where
there
are
federal
standards,
you
don't
worry
about
how
it's
going
to
help
the
railroad,
basically,
so
long
as
the
defendant
is
treated
fairly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
questioning,
that
the
ultimate
question
is
to
be
decided
by
federal
law.
but
i'm
just
saying,
why
does
federal
law
factor
in
this
concern
that
the
prosecutor
not...
fail
to
prosecute
as
much
as
he
should?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that's
the
concern
of
the
federal
law.
the
federal
concern
here
is
that
in
1983,
plaintiff
not
be
unfairly
euchered
cut
of
his
right
to
sue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
that
be
for
new
hampshire
to
decide
here,
whether
they
want
their
prosecutors
wasting
time
or
not
and
whether
that
sort
of
thing
serves
the
public
interest?
i
mean,
why
is
that
particular
aspect
of
this
argument
something
that
should
be
decided
by
a
federal
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bauer.
mr.
gardner,
do
you
have
anything
else?
you've
got
three
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
gardner.
the
case
is
submitted.
