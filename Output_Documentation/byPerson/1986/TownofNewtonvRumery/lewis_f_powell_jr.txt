justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gardner,
i
understood
that
you
were
denying
that
there
was
any
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
you
are
saying
that
there
has
been
no
violation
of
constitutional
rights
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
were
not
making
that
entirely
clear.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
bauer,
would
you
pick
up
on
this
constitutional
question
and
tell
us
why
you
think
we
have
a
constitutional
question
before
us?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
that
the
first
circuit
did
not
cite
a
single
united
states
supreme
court
decision?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
didn't
mention
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
did
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
that
not
present
a
factual
question,
whether
or
not
there
was
coercion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
want
a
retrial?
