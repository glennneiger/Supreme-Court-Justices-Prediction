justice
thurgood
marshall
can
i
get
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
what
is
the
constitutional
violation
that
you
urge
this
court
to
find
in
this
case,
specifically?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
has
your
client
been
harmed?
let
me
try
that
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
it
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
denies
your
client
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
violated
what
section
of
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
it
doesn't,
why...
where
do
we
get
jurisdiction?
where
does
this
court
get
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
take
away
all
covenants
not
to
sue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
not,
what
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
all
covenants
not
to
sue.
that's
just
about
all
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
you
don't
have
a
covenant
not
to
sue
unless
you've
given
up
something.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
so,
you
say
you
can't
give
up
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you
say
that
if
you
sign
a
covenant
not
to
sue,
you
don't
give
up
your
federal
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
forced
to
give
up
your
federal
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can't
covenant
to
give
them
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
are
you
forced
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
to
give
up
plea
bargaining?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--you
want
us
to
put
a
wall
up
against
all
of
it
by
saying,
you
just
can't
sign
a
covenant
not
to
sue,
and
i
don't
see
any
authority
under
the
sun
that
you
have
for
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we've
had
covenants
not
to
sue
since
we've
had
courts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
now
we're
going
to
exchange
all
of
that
and
we're
going
to
make
one
little
narrow
exception,
that
you
can
covenant
not
to
sue
on
every
statute
in
the
world
except
1983.
that's
what
you
are
asking
us
for.
