mr.
george
russel
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
classic
1983
case.
this
is
not
a
case
about
a
$400
check.
this
is
a
case
about
lynn
conway's
right
not
to
be
abused,
and
to
be
persecuted
by
the
state
criminal
justice
system.
here
the
petitioners
intentionally
misused
the
state's
coercive
powers
to
destroy
lynn
conway's
constitutional
rights.
they
conspired
to
use
that
system
for
their
own
self-serving
ends
in
their
attempt
to
extort
money
from
her
to
pay
for
work
that
had
been
shoddily
done,
and
as
to
which
she
probably
did
not
owe
a
penny.
in
this
conspiracy
they
ran
roughshod
over
her
constitutional
rights.
they
had
her
arrested,
knowing
that
she
had
committed
no
crime.
they
hauled
her
into
justice
cerbone's
courtroom,
where
he
dispensed
his
own
brand
of
home
town
justice,
to
the
benefit
of
his
family
and
his
clients.
she
was
stripped
of
her
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
george
russel
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
russel
miller
your
honor,
we
have
two
separate
causes
of
action
under
new
york
law.
and
really
we're
talking--
mr.
george
russel
miller
--we're
talking
1983,
but
we're
using...
as
1983
has
done
in
the
past,
picking
up
the
tort
law
as
a
model
on
which
to
model
itself.
the--
mr.
george
russel
miller
--no,
you
cannot,
you're
correct
on
that,
your
honor.
and
the
malicious
prosecution
tort,
and
the
notion
behind
a
malicious
prosecution,
focuses
on
the
bringing
of
an
unfounded
claim
for
a
malicious
purpose.
it
does
not
focus
on
the
arrest
itself,
although
it
would
sweep
up
the
arrest.
mr.
george
russel
miller
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
part--
mr.
george
russel
miller
--that
would
not
be
time
barred,
because
this
was
a
continuing
conspiracy,
your
honor.
you
can
look
at
the
conduct
that
was
initiated
when
they
decided
to
commence
the
prosecution
to
have
her
arrested,
up
until
the
moment
that
the
charges
were
finally
dismissed.
mr.
george
russel
miller
however,
this
court
has
recognized
in,
say,
adickes
v.
kress,
the
notion
of
a
conspiratorial
element
as
stating
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
george
russel
miller
i
had
not
seen
this
court
hold
specifically
that
it
is.
i
would
not
say
that
it
would
be
barred.
i
would
say
that
the
issue
has
not
come
before
this
court.
this
court
has
not
held
that
it
is
not...
that
a
conspiracy
is
not
a
violation
of
1983.
indeed,
when
you
look
at
the
"subjects
or
causes
to
be
subjected.
"
language
of
the
statute
itself,
that
would
seem
to
imply
that
conspiratorial
conduct
would
be
incorporated
in
that.
however,
i
can
think
of
no
specific
holding.
mr.
george
russel
miller
i
believe
there
is,
your
honor,
but
i'm
not
altogether
certain.
also,
there
are
other
substantive
rights
that
were
violated
here,
your
honor.
there
was
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
two
years
and
82
days
elapsed
from
the
date
of
her
arraignment...
or...
until
the
date
when
the
charges
were
finally
dismissed.
now,
that...
part
of
that
time
is
attributable
to
her
own
conduct
in
bringing
the
appeal.
however,
that
is
not...
that
still
does
not
change
the
fact
that
there
were
180
days
that
had
elapsed;
and
that
180
days
is
three
times
the
period
that
is
allowed
by
3030
of
the
new
york
criminal
procedure
law.
now,
while
that
is
not
binding
on
this
court
for
the
notion
of
speedy
trial,
it
does
suggest...
give
some
sort
of
guideline
as
to
what
would
be
the
speedy
trial
idea
under
new
york
law.
mr.
george
russel
miller
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
because
the
person
who
is
sitting
there
with
charges
pending
against
them
does
go
through
great
mental
anguish.
they
do
not
know
what
is
happening.
if
they
are
confronted
with
a
court
such
as
justice
cerbone's
court,
where
they
may...
they
have
no
idea
what
is
going
to
happen.
they
know
that
the
judge
is
biased
against
them.
that
becomes
an
awfully
long
time,
your
honor.
mr.
george
russel
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
is...
there
was
the
deprivation
of
liberty.
technically,
she
was
under
arrest
during
this
entire
period.
while
she
had
been
released
on
her
own
recognizance,
she
was
within...
under
the
custody
of
the
state.
mr.
george
russel
miller
yes,
your
honor,
they
do
rely
on
that.
but
in
the...
i
would
direct
your
attention
to
your
honors'
opinion
in
parratt
at
page
535,
where
you
wrote
that
in
any
1983
action,
initial
inquiry
must
focus
on
whether
the
two
essential
elements
of
a
1983
cause
of
action
are
present,
one,
whether
the
conduct
complained
of
was
committed
by
a
person
acting
under
color
of
state
law;
clearly
we
have
that
here.
and
two,
whether
this
conduct
deprived
a
person
of
rights,
privileges,
or
immunities
secured
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
here
we
have
the
substantive
due
process
right
of
the
unbiased
form,
plus
we
have
the
specific
constitutional
guarantees
against
the
illegal
search
and
seizure,
and
against
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
george
russel
miller
yes,
you
did,
your
honor.
but
you
were
also,
in
those
two
cases,
dealing
with
specific
property
interests.
these
were
state-created
rights;
not
federally-created
rights.
and
as
justice
stevens
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
daniels
set
forth
the
procedural
due
process
claim,
it
is
not
the
deprivation
of
property
that
is
actionable;
it
is
the
fact
that
the
property
is
deprived
without
due
process
of
law.
without
adequate
redress,
it
becomes
actionable
under
1983.
so
that
in
the
hudson
and
parratt,
you
were
dealing
with
property...
state-created
property
interests.
and
the
state
did
provide
redress,
albeit
it
was
post-deprivation
rather
than
pre-deprivation.
mr.
george
russel
miller
other
than
the
speedy
trial
and
the
unbiased
forum
and
the
false...
the
bad
arrest.
there
is
also
a
fourth...
basically,
a
procedural
due
process
claim.
and
that
was
justice
cerbone's
stripping
away
lynn
conway's
right
to
a
malicious
prosecution
action
under
state
law.
mr.
george
russel
miller
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
the
last
one...
well,
the
last
one
is
a
procedural
due
process,
which
i
would
distinguish
from
the
substantive
due
process
claimed.
mr.
george
russel
miller
that,
your
honor,
is
the
injury
that
she
sustained.
i
think
we
have
to
distinguish
between
the
rights
that
are
deprived,
and
the
injury
that
is
sustained
as
a
result
of
that
deprivation.
mr.
george
russel
miller
i
do
not.
that
was
quite
soundly
decided
in
paul
v.
davis,
your
honor.
mr.
george
russel
miller
i
think
it
was
a
million
dollars,
your
honor.
under
new
york--
mr.
george
russel
miller
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
russel
miller
that
is
the
allegation,
your
honor.
we
still
have
the
burden
of
proving
it.
this
is
coming
up
on
a
summary
judgment
motion.
mr.
george
russel
miller
in
addressing
the
reply
brief
that
the
petitioners
have
served,
they
make
much
of
the
fact
that
lynn
conway
had
violated
section
190.05
of
the
new
york
penal
law.
in
fact,
at
the
time
she
wrote
the
check,
she
had
sufficient
money
in
the
bank,
in
her
account,
to
cover
that
check.
at
page
28
of
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
see
her
bank
statement,
which
shows
that
on
the
10th
and
11th
of
may,
she
had
$441.37
in
her
account,
or
$10
more
than
this
check
was
for.
if
bano
buick
had
gone
down
to
the
bank
the
following
morning
after
she
had
picked
up
her
car
and
cashed
the
check,
they
would
have
been
paid
in
full.
the
petitioners
make
much--
mr.
george
russel
miller
--that
is
under
the
new
york
law,
your
honor?
mr.
george
russel
miller
well,
that
is...
goes
to
the
issue
of--
mr.
george
russel
miller
--your
honor,
we
are
locking
here
at
a
1983
claim.
now,
the
second
circuit
had
adopted,
under
the
adoption
rule
of
section
1988,
had
picked
up
the
new
york
law
of
malicious
prosecution
as
being...
that
the
same
elements
that
would
state
a
claim
for
malicious
prosecution
would
state
a
claim
for
1983
violation.
i
think
that,
in
short,
what
it
is
doing
is
what
this
court
has
done,
is
to
model
a
1983
claim
on
existing
state
law.
but
this
court
obviously
is
not
bound
by
the
state
law.
the
question
that
i
was
raising
was
whether,
under
the
malicious
prosecution
notion,
there
was
probable
cause,
or
whether
there
had
in
fact
been
a
criminal
violation.
and
in
fact,
she
had
not
violated
section
190.05
of
the
new
york
law.
the
petitioners
make
much
of
the
adjournments
and
delays
in
this
case.
however,
it
appears
that
justice
cerbone's
clients,
the
martabanos,
who
were
conducting
this
private
prosecution,
did
not
show
up
on
four
of
the
occasions.
it's
very
hard
to
object
to
that
in
those
situations.
and
it
does
not
change
the
fact
that
there
180
days
that
elapsed
from
the
date...
she
entered
her
plea
on
august
4th,
1977,
to
the
time
her
attorney
brought
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
prosecute
within
a
speedy
time.
that
was
on
february
1st,
1978.
mr.
george
russel
miller
i
think
under
the
court...
as
i
see
it
being
framed
under
1983,
i
think
they
all
go
into
the
same
hopper,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is,
perhaps,
harder
damage,
when
you
have
the
arrest.
and
it's
very
hard
to
quantify
the
damage
for
injury
to
reputation.
if
you
look
at
the...
at
the
paul
case,
for
example--
mr.
george
russel
miller
--i
think
the
paul
decision...
there
there
was
no
attempt
to
deprive
anybody
of
any
state
right...
or
of
any
rights.
that
was
a
clearly
negligent
act
by
the
police
chief.
what
had
happened
though,
here,
this
was
part
of
the
conspiracy
to
get
money
out
of
my
client.
it
was
an
intentional
act.
if,
let's
say,
in
paul,
davis
had
been...
they
had
known
that
davis
was
a
communist
sympathizer
or
whatever,
and
in
order
to
get
back
at
him,
they'd
included
him...
his
mug
shot
in
the
list
of
active
shoplifters,
i
think
that
would
have
been
a
very
different
case,
your
honor.
mr.
george
russel
miller
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
george
russel
miller
it
did,
sort
of
in
passing,
your
honor,
on
page
a4
of
the
appendix,
i
believe.
it
is
not
what
i
would
call
the
most...
it
is
not
a
terribly
scholar
discussion
of
that
issue.
mr.
george
russel
miller
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that
would
run
squarely
contrary
to
the
holding
in
monroe
v.
pape.
because
monroe
had
held
that
there
is
no
sort
of
exhaustion
requirement,
or
abstention
doctrine
that
the
federal
courts
must
observe.
mr.
george
russel
miller
parratt
and
hudson,
your
honor,
limit
themselves
by
their
own
terms
to
procedural
due
process
claims.
and
that
is
where
the
right
that
is
being
vindicated
is
a
state-created
right.
the
inquiry
then
becomes
whether
the
right
is
a...
whether
there's
a
deprivation
of
that
state
created
property
interest
without
due
process
of
law.
it's
only
when
you
have
the
absence
of
due
process
of
law
that
the
federal
interest
becomes
implicated.
that,
i
would
submit,
does
not
apply
when
you're
dealing
with
substantive
federal
rights,
either
specific
guarantees
of
the
constitution,
or
with
substantive
due
process.
mr.
george
russel
miller
yes,
your
honor,
but
there
was
no
claim
that
this
was
an
eighth
amendment
cruel
and
inhuman
punishment
type
of
violation.
there
was
no
claim
of
any
other
constitutional
right
being
violated.
there
was
no
claim...
the
court
specifically
considered
whether
there
was
a
zone
of
privacy
that
had
been
invaded.
and
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
zone
of
privacy
that
was
relevant
in
that
particular
case,
or
a
zone
of
privacy
where
the
prisoner
had
a
reasonable
expectation
that
his
possessions
would
not
be
searched.
mr.
george
russel
miller
no,
they
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
george
russel
miller
that
parratt,
your
honor,
does
not...
yes,
that
is
my
position,
your
honor.
at
least
not
a
liberty
interest
that
is
secured
by
the
constitution.
in
other
words,
if
we're
dealing
with
the
constitutional
right--
mr.
george
russel
miller
--i
don't
think
it
makes
much
of
a
difference,
your
honor,
that's
what
i
was
just
saying.
mr.
george
russel
miller
what
i
was
saying
is,
if
it's
a
state
created
liberty
interest
that
is
not...
does
not
have
an
analog
under
the
federal
constitutional
rights,
then
the
state
would
become
liable
only
if
it
makes
the
deprivation
without
adequate
redress.
mr.
george
russel
miller
that
is
not
the
case
here
because
there
are
specific
federal
rights
that
have
been
violated,
your
honor.
mr.
george
russel
miller
the
four
rights
that
we're
alleging,
first,
is
the
speedy
trial
right,
which
is
the
sixth
amendment
with
specific
guarantee.
the
arrest,
which
is
a
fourth
amendment
guarantee.
then
there
is
a
substantive
due
process
right,
that
is,
the
right
to
an
impartial
forum.
and
then
finally
there
is
the
right
to
have
her
cause
of
action
untampered
with.
and
justice
cerbone
went
down...
or
had
appended
to
the
docket
sheet,
not
on
the
merits,
in
an
apparent
attempt
to
destroy
the
cause
of
action
under
new
york
state
law
for
malicious
prosecution.
mr.
george
russel
miller
they
were
not
addressed
below,
your
honor.
mr.
george
russel
miller
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
claim--
mr.
george
russel
miller
--if
this
court
reverses
the
second
circuit
and
requires
a
dismissal
of
the
cause
of
action,
the
the
sixth
amendment
claim,
speedy
trial
claim,
can
never
be
raised.
the
action
would
be
time
barred.
so
i
would
say
that
it
has
to
come
up
now,
if
ever.
and
it
was
alleged
in
the
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
george
russel
miller
at
present,
all.
mr.
george
russel
miller
would
be
time
barred,
your
honor.
well,
i
take
that
back.
they
were
timely
as
of
the
time
they
were
raised.
now,
they
would
be
time
barred,
if
this
cause
of
action
is
dismissed.
mr.
george
russel
miller
the
speedy
trial
would
not
have
matured
until
such
time
as
the
cause
of
action...
the
criminal
complaint
was
dismissed.
because
there
would
be
no
indication
as
to
how
long
it
had
been
before
the
case
would
have
been
dismissed
until
that...
september
20th,
1979.
the
interference
with
the
malicious
prosecution
cause
of
action,
that
occurred
on
september
20th,
1979,
at
the
end
of
the
period.
it
was
the
arrest
that
occurred
at
the
beginning.
the
petitioners
make
the
argument
that
the
substantive
due
process
is
not
properly
before
this
court,
and
it
was
never
considered
by
the
second
circuit.
it
fact,
it
had
been
considered.
the
second
circuit
did
not
feel
that
it
had
to
rely
upon
that.
now,
i
suspect
there
may
have
been
some...
that
judge
oakes'
treatment
of
the
case
was
that
he
felt
that
seven
hours
of
detention
was
sufficiently
enough
to
remand
the
case
for
trial
that
he
need
not
go
exploring
for
other
constitutional
rights.
but
as
long
as
there
is
one
constitutional
right,
we
submit
that
this
case
has
to
go
to
trial
in
the
district
court.
the
petitioners
have
tried
to
make
an
argument
that
there
is
a
cutoff
point
at
the
moment
of
arraignment
under
new
york
law
between
the
false
arrest
claim,
which
ceases
from
the
moment
of
arraignment.
from
this
they
seek
to
infer
that
there
is
the
beginning
of
a
malicious
prosecution
cause
of
action
that
starts
at
the
moment
of
arraignment.
that
is
squarely
belied
under
new
york
law.
sheldon
v.
carpenter,
for
example...
and
i
quote
from
4
new
york
580...
states
that
in
an
action
for
malicious
prosecution,
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
recover
damages,
not
only
for
his
unlawful
arrest
and
imprisonment
and
for
the
expense
of
his
defense,
but
for
the
injury
to
his
name
and
character
by
reason
of
the
false
accusation.
now,
this
is
at
least
a
clear
indication
of
new
york's
intent
on
the
malicious
prosecution
cause
of
action.
we
submit
that
this
court
is
clearly
not
bound
by
new
york
state
law
in
formulating
the
causes
of
action
under
1983.
but
1983
should
form
a
model.
it
should
indicate
the
conduct
that
is
wrongful,
for
example,
the
conduct
of
conspiring,
as
it
were,
to
do
a
number
on
lynn
conway,
to
get
money
from
her,
to
make
her
pay
on
a
check
for
work
that
was
not
done.
here,
lynn
conway
suffered
from
the
petitioner's
abuses
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
they
conspired
to
violate
her
federal
rights
in
a
scheme
to
extort
money.
they
had
her
arrested.
she
was
handcuffed,
forced
into
the
police
car,
hauled
to
the
village
court
of
mt.
kisco
some
45
minutes
away.
she
was
held
under
confinement
for
seven
hours.
she
was
arraigned
at
1:30
in
the
morning,
and
released
on
her
own
recognizance.
then
she
was
hauled
before
justice
cerbone's
courtroom,
where,
under
the
mt.
kisco
quaint
custom,
the
martabanos,
who
were
the
complaining
witnesses,
also
handled
the
private
criminal
prosecution.
nor
surprisingly,
the
martabanos,
who
were
justice
cerbone's
cousins
and
clients,
managed
to
prevail,
under
the
assistant
district
attorney
stepped
in
and
said
that
they
would
not
go
forward
with
the
case.
and
that
point,
justice
cerbone
screamed
out
through
the
courtroom,
you
will
continue
to
try
this
case...
or
prosecute
this
case.
you
will
try
it,
and
you
will
get
a
conviction.
lynn
conway
was
stripped
of
her
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
two
years
and
82
days
elapsed
from
the
date
of
her
arrest,
until
the
date
that
she
was
finally
released.
her
cause
of
action
for
malicious
prosecution
had
been
stripped.
in
short,
the
respondent
submits
that
the
petitioners,
alfred
martabano,
alfred
v.
martabano,
bano
buick,
and
vincent
cerbone,
engaged
in
a
classic
violation
of
section
1983.
they
conspired
to
deprive
lynn
conway
of
rights,
privileges,
and
immunities
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
thank
you.
