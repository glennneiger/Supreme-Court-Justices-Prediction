justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
close,
refresh
my
recollection.
section
1983
doesn't
refer
to
malicious
prosecution,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
refer
to
any
state
tort,
as
such,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
gives
a
cause
of
action
for
violation
of
someone's
federal
right
to
life,
liberty,
or
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
no
necessary
correlation
between
your
cause
of
action
under
section...
no
reason
whatever
to
believe
that
there's
any
necessary
correlation
between
your
right
of
action
under
1983,
and
whatever
state
cause
of
action
you
might
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
really
quite
irrelevant
how
new
york
state
chooses
to
define
its
cause
of
action
for
malicious
prosecution,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
have
to
look
at
each
element
of
what
happened
here
to
see
whether
each
separate
element...
the
arrest,
the
later
filing
of
the
criminal
complaint...
or
the
prior
filing
of
the
criminal
complaint,
the
later
proceedings,
each
separate
element
to
see
whether
any
one
of
them
constituted
a
deprivation
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
doesn't
matter
to
us
how
new
york
chooses
to
define
these
things
for
tort
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
except
to
the
extent...
that
also,
except
to
the
extent
that
we
have
to
refer
to
a
new
york
statute
of
limitations
in
absence
of
a
federal
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well
i...
it
seems
to
me...
you're
confusing
me,
anyway,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
your
helping
your
case
by
choosing
to
analyze
this
on
the
grounds
on
new
york
tort
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
not
what
this
suit
is
about
at
all.
it's
about
1983.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
malicious...
again,
you're
answering
a
question
as
to
what
a
malicious
prosecution
case
would
consist
of.
what
malicious
prosecution
case?
under
new
york
law?
under
new
jersey
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
we
talking
about
a
malicious
prosecution
case
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
a
1983
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
position
is
that
some
of
the
elements
which
may
go
to
making
a
malicious
prosecution
claim
under
new
york
law
may
constitute
a
violation
of
1983;
and
others
may
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
have
to
look
at
each
one
to
see
whether
it
violates
1983
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
that
the
only
thing
i
think
that
your
client
suffered
which
i
would
accent
as
a
deprivation
of
life,
liberty
or
property,
without
due
process,
was
the
detention
in
the
jail
facility.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
time
barred?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
about
new
york
law.
i'm
talking
about
1983.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there's
quite
a
difference.
new
york
tort
law
does
not
require,
for
recover,
a
deprivation
of
life,
liberty
or
property,
as
the
federal
constitution
does.
so
you
can't
take
every
element
of
whatever
tort
chooses
to
define
to
be
an
element
of
a
1983
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
not
talking
about
a
malicious
prosecution
tort.
i'm
talking
under
1983
about
the
deprivation
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
i'm
not
talking
about
a
malicious
prosecution
tort.
now,
just
make
believe
that
that's
the
way
i'm
going
to
approach
this
case.
so
i
want
to
look
and
find
some
deprivation
of
liberty.
and
the
clear
one
that
i
find
is
keeping
your
client
in
custody
before
the
arraignment.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
but
that
occurred
a
long
time
ago.
now
why
isn't
that
time
barred--
justice
antonin
scalia
--1983
does
not
give
a
cause
of
action
for
a
conspiracy.
read
the
text
of
1983.
it
does
not
give
a
cause
of
action
for
a
conspiracy.
it
gives
a
cause
of
action
for
the
deprivation
of
the
life,
liberty
or
property.
1985
gives
a
cause
of
action
for
conspiracy.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
use
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
to
attribute
state
action
to
private
actors;
for
that
purpose,
we've
used
conspiracy.
but
have
we
ever
used
a
conspiracy
under
1983...
has
there
ever
been
a
cause
of
action
given
for
conspiring
under
1983?
1983
doesn't
speak
of
conspiring
as
a
cause
of
action.
you
know,
there
are
federal
crimes
of
conspiracy.
it's
a
separate
crime
in
itself.
but
it's
not
an
offense
in
itself
under
1983,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
a
state
tort
of
conspiracy,
do
you
know,
as
a
separate
tort?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
claim
that
there
is
some
right,
privilege
or
immunity
at
issue
here
other
than
the
due
process
deprivation?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
these
are
all
under
the
category
of
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about
parratt
and
hudson?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
difference?
i
thought
the
line
you
were
drawing
was
whether
it
was
a
procedural
due
process
claim.
and
i
can
understand
your
trying
to
draw
a
line
there.
but
if
it
is
a
procedural
due
process
claim,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
life,
liberty
or
property
as
the
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me
the
federal
rights
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
of
these
federal
rights
would...
that
you
just
mentioned
in
answer
to
me
a
minute
ago
would
be
time
barred
if
you
couldn't
tack
them
on
to
the
malicious
prosecution?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
be
time
barred?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no,
that's--
