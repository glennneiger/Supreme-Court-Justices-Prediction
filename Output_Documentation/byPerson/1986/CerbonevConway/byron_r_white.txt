justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be,
but
they
did
it.
do
you
suppose...
yes,
and
do
you
suppose
that
evidence
of
the
detention
is
an
element
of
damages
under
malicious
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
there
had
never
been...
what
if
there
had
never
been
an
allegation
in
this
case
of
a
false
arrest?
just
malicious
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
it
would
have
been
wrong,
you
suppose,
for
the
court
to
consider
evidence
of
detention,
as
part
of
the
malicious
prosecution
allegations?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
allegation
is
that
some
person
convinced
a
policeman
or
a
judge
to
get
out
a
warrant
for
somebody;
we
just
want
to
get
this
person.
let's
get
him
arrested
and
put
him
in
jail,
and
these
may
be
trumped
up
charges,
but
meanwhile...
but
we'll
get
back
at
them.
let's
just
suppose
it's
something
as
nasty
as
that,
a
malicious
prosecution
case.
couldn't
a
malicious
prosecution
case
include
a
plan
to
keep
somebody
in
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
person
was
kept
in
jail
on
a
trumped
up
charge,
before
her
allegation.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
some
difference
between
your
ability
to
recover
for
the
detention
in
jail
for
seven
hours,
and
your
ability
to
recover
for
pain
and
suffering
or
loss
of
reputation
for
purposes
of
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
hadn't
been
an
illegal
detention,
you
don't
think
the
paul
case
would
cause
you
trouble?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
second
circuit
deal
with
paul,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
it
deal
at
all
with
the
availability
of
a
state
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
say
if
one
of
the
grounds
for
dismissal
was
that
there's
a
perfectly
adequate
state
remedy
here,
and
there's
just
no
constitutional
violation
as
long
as
there
is
such
a
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
neither
of
those
involved
some
illegal
imprisonment?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
parratt
just
doesn't
reach
liberty
interests?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
the
case
here?
