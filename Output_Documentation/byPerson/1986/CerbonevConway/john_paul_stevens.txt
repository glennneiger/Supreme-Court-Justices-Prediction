justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
may
i
just
interrupt?
how
can
you
say
they're
out
of
the
case
when
the
second
circuit
said
they
were
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
only
on
the
state
law
cause
of
action.
under
the
1983
cause,
they...
as
i
understand
it...
they
say
the
complaint
alleges
seven
hours
of
detention,
great
humiliation,
ridicule
and
mental
anguish
and
so
forth.
and
these
allegations
are
quite
sufficient
to
constitute
a
constitutional
deprivation
of
liberty
action
under
1983.
so
they
held
for
1983
purposes
they
were
part
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
don't
understand
the
second
circuit
to
be
talking
about
state
law
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
puzzled
when
you
say
that
the
seven
hours
of
detention
and
so
forth
are
out
of
the
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
the
second
circuit,
as
i
read
their
opinion
on
page
a4,
says
this
is
part
of
their...
the
basis
for
their
determination
that
her
liberty
was
affected
by
what
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
close,
may
i
just
ask
you
again--
--what
happens
if
you
don't
appear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
close,
let
me
just
go
back...
d--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
this
question
justice
o'connor
really
raised
with
you
before.
you
say,
just
these
mere
allegations.
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
statute
of
limitations
bars
the
separate
tort
for
false
arrest,
and
there's
no
question
about
it.
but
on
the
malicious
prosecution,
is
it
not
correct
that
it
was
the
same
prosecution
continuing
from
june
of
'77
until
september
of
'79?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
now
if
the
action
for
malicious
prosecution
is
timely,
would
it
not
be
a
part
of
the
cause
of
action
to
take
into
account
all
of
the
facts
concerning
that
prosecution,
including
the
detention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
not
part
of
the
malicious
prosecution
claim
whether
it's
a
matter
of
federal
or
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
part
of
the
proceeding
which
she
said
was
malicious.
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
spent
seven
hours
in
detention.
it
was
part
of
the
proceeding.
that
is
the
basis
of
a
malicious
prosecution
case,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
law
cause
of
action
for
false
arrest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
they
did
err.
but
they
did
keep
alive
the
malicious
prosecution
portion
of
the
1983
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
that
makes
you
so
sure
that
the
only
evidence
that
would
be
admissible
in
support
of
that
claim
is
what
happened
after
some
intermediate
point
in
the
prosecution.
i
don't
understand
that.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
itself
specifically
recited
the...
this
detention
as
part
of
the
malicious
prosecution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
you
lose
your
great
humiliation,
ridicule
and
mental
anguish
in
your
catalog?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend
that
her
reputation
is
any
part
of
the
liberty
that
is
protected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
correct
that
the
judgment
you're
appealing
is
an
order
that
has
the
effect
of
denying
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
case
is
just
ready
to
get
started
for
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that's
all
that's
at
stake,
is
whether
there's
enough
here
to
go
to
trial.
