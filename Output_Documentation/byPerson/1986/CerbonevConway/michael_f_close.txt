mr.
michael
f.
close
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
good
morning.
this
is
a
dispute
about
a
$400
check;
actually,
a
$430
check.
underlying
it
is
a
dispute
about
a
car
repair
that
was
apparently
not
authorized,
or
at
least
allegedly
not
authorized.
it's
been
going
on
now
for
almost
ten
years.
it's
been
in
seven
or
eight
courts
before
it
got
to
this
court.
now,
the
plaintiff
and
respondent
admits
in
the
record
that
this
case
reached
the
federal
courts
because
it
was
not
timely
under
state
law.
they'd
blown
the
state
statute
of
limitations
against
the
target
defendant.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
justice
oakes'
opinion
below
did
take
umbrage
at
i
think
some
of
my
own
actions
in
this
case,
and
certainly
my
client's
actions.
yes,
my
client
is
also
substantively
appalled
that
we
are
still
litigating
a
$400
check.
it's
our
contention,
both
literally
and
colloquially,
that
you
can't
make
a
federal
case
out
of
it.
it
just
never
belonged
in
federal
court.
it
was
something
that
should
have
been
resolved
in
small
claims
court
or
the
justice
court.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
the
problem
with
that...
the
answer
to
that
is
not
in
the
record.
the
dispute
begins
in
april
of
1977
when
the
respondent's
car
blew
up
on
an
interstate
highway.
"blew
up"
is
their
phrase.
it
was
taken
under
tow
to
bano
buick,
which
is
the
co-petitioner
here.
and
although
the
parties
disagree
on
what,
they
do
agree
that
the
car
needed
a
totally
new
engine.
now,
the
conways'
version
of
the
facts...
and
we
have
to
accept
that
for
purpose
of
today's
argument...
is
that
they
would
go
out
and
look
in
the
local
junkyards
for
a
replacement
engine,
and
that
bano
buick
was
not
supposed
to
do
anything
until
the
conways
had
found
the
engine
that
they
wanted
put
back
into
the
1973
opel,
which
was
the
faulty
car.
now,
mr.
conway,
jeff
conway,
went
out
and
found
engines,
looked...
scoured
the
area.
and
apparently,
when
he
found
the
engine
that
he
said
should
be
put
into
the
car,
he
called
up
bano
buick
and
said,
hey,
i've
got
the
engine.
well,
bano
buick
then
said,
oh,
glad
you
called.
we're
just
about
to
start
your
car.
and
we'd
like
you
to
come
down
and
pick
it
up.
apparently,
he
says,
what
are
you
talking
about?
i
haven't
authorized
it.
well,
anyway,
he
and
mrs.
conway
come
down.
they
get
to
the...
they
get
to
the
car
dealership,
and
they
see
in
the
car
what
they
say...
and
we
have
to
accept
this
as
true
also
for
purposes
of
today...
they
saw
a
junk
engine
that
he
had
seen
in
another
croton
falls
junkyard,
and
he
had
turned
that
engine
down
because
he
didn't
think
it
was
a
good
enough
engine
to
put
in
the
car.
so
whatever
argument
they
had,
their
version
of
the
dispute
is
that...
which
they
swear
to...
is
that
they
were
bullied
and
intimidated
by
bano
buick.
bano
buick
was
going
to...
if
they
wanted
to
put
in
a
different
engine,
was
going
to
charge
them
more
money,
and
whatever.
their
phrase
is
that,
in
fear
they
wrote
out
the
check
for
the
amount
and
initiated
their
escape
and
left.
the
next
day
the
usual
practice
of
bano
is
to
deposit
their
checks.
they
deposited
the
disputed
check,
which
is
no.
154.
it's
dated
the
10th
of
may,
1977.
bano
deposits
the
check.
it
comes
back:
insufficient
funds.
they
say
they
hold
the
check
a
couple
of
days,
and
they
call
in
to
see
if
there's
sufficient
funds.
they
redeposit
the
check.
this
time
it
comes
back:
stop
payment.
now,
at
this
point
the
parties
disagree
as
to
who
exactly
said
what.
the
banos
claim
they
made
a
reasonable
offer
to
settle
with
the
conways,
to
say,
we'll
give
you
credit
for
the
old
engine,
but
we'll
charge
you
for
the
work.
the
conways
dispute
that.
whatever
it
was,
they
couldn't
reach
a
settlement
then
of
this
dispute,
as
to
whether
the
check
would
be
honored,
or
what
banos
would
do
on
it.
and
with
negotiations
at
an
apparent
impasse,
apparently
the
banos
went
to
my
client,
who
is
the
village
justice
and
also
a
local
lawyer,
and
they
brought
the
check
to
him.
and
such
advice
which
is
third-hand
in
the
record,
as
he
said
to
us,
look,
the
first...
the
bounced
check
is
a
criminal
whatever,
and
the
subsequent
stop
payment
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
it,
because
it's
after
the
check.
i
would
have
thought
that
advice
was
correct
under
state
law
at
the
time
that
he
gave
it
anyway.
mr.
michael
f.
close
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
i
think...
our
point
is
that
there
is
no
constitutional
claim
at
all.
her
complaint,
as
we
see
it,
because
the
false
arrest
claim
is
out
of
the
case.
it's
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
michael
f.
close
your
honor,
i--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--well,
no.
malicious
prosecution
might
require
a
little
more
than
arrest.
but
she
has
more
than
an
arrest
here.
she
has
an
actual
prosecution.
so
she
had
the--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--no,
she's
wrong
to
the
extent
that
she's
suggesting
that
she
can
recover
damages
for
the
false
arrest
as
part
of
her
malicious
prosecution
claim.
we...
we...
i
cite
in
my
reply
brief
all
the
cases
she
cites.
there
is
dicta
to
that
effect.
none
of
the
cases
she's
relying
on
in
fact
deal
with
this
problem
of
what
happens
if
you
can
correct
for
malicious
prosecution
but
not
false
arrest.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
if
she
were
correct
that
it's
not...
that
it's
not...
then
that
leads
to
the
result
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
dismissing
the
claims
of
arrest
and
imprisonment
as
time
barred.
the
cases
she
cites
for
that
proposition
don't
say
that.
the
reason
is...
it's
dicta,
and
the
reason
is,
in
almost
every
case,
you
have
a
false
arrest
and
a
malicious
prosecution
together.
you
always
sue
for
both.
in
the
cases
where
you
have
to
distinguish
recovery
from
one
theory
than
the
other,
we
have
cited
in
our
reply
briefs,
the
courts
have
uniformly
held
what
you
can
recover
for
under
new
york
law...
and
we
don't
concede
new
york
law
actually
governs
this...
what
you
can
recover
for
under
new
york
law
for
false
arrest
is
everything
up
to
the
arraignment.
and
from
the
arraignment
onwards
is
malicious
prosecution.
therefore,
if
new
york
law
is
controlling,
new
york
law
clearly
is
that
she
can
only
recover
from
the
arraignment
forward.
mr.
michael
f.
close
no,
or
the
court
below
did
not
hold
that.
they
relied
on
federal
law
under
singleton.
and
they...
they...
the
court
below
held
that
these
questions
of
accrual
and
so
forth
were
governed
by
federal
law.
they
looked
at
singleton,
although
singleton
then
incorporates
a
state
law
anyway.
and
the
court
below
held
that
singleton
was
controlling
and
dismissed
it.
we've
always
regarded
the
false
arrest
and
imprisonment
claims
as
out
of
the
case
because
the
court
below
dismissed
them
as
time
barred.
and
we
don't...
they're
not
here
because
she
didn't
cross
petition.
with
those
claims
out
of
the
case,
it's
much
simpler
to
analyze.
the
question
is--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--well,
but
the
second
circuit
said
they
were
out
of
the
case,
also.
mr.
michael
f.
close
no,
because...
for
statute
of
limitations
purposes,
if
you
look
at
the
statute
of
limitations
ruling,
which
is
at
822,
i
believe--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--they
are
ruling,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
if
we're
just
talking
about
state
law,
she's
way
out
of
court
on
state
law,
mr.
justice
stevens.
on
state
law,
she
has
a
one-year
statute.
if
we're
talking
about
state
law,
that's
governed
by
section
215.3
of
the
cplr,
and
both
malicious
prosecution
and
false
arrest
are
one-year
statute
and
she's
out.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
i'm
sorry,
then
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
close
and
i...
that's
dictum,
because
it...
that's
just
dictum
because
it
ignores
what
he
just
did
at
a22.
the
only
imaginable
theory
of
recovery
that
is
even
possibly
in
the
case
is
section
1933...
83.
and
under
a22,
they've
dismissed,
very
plainly,
mrs.
conway's
civil
rights
claims
based
on
arrest
or
false
imprisonment
are
barred
by
the
statute.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
close
but
the
detention
is...
he
just
held
that
to
the
extent
that
this
is
a
1983
claim
based
on
detention,
and
that's
the
argument
in
singleton,
that
is
time
barred
as
a
matter
of
1983
law.
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
holding
is
at
a22;
that
that
part
is...
and
he
relies
back
on
singleton,
which
had,
again,
addressed
this
as
a
matter
of
1983
law,
what
statute
to
apply
it
and
when
to
apply
it.
i
can't
explain
a4
except
to
say
that
they
forgot
what
they
did
at
a22,
and
the
point
about
the
seven
hours
of
detention
is
dictum.
what
he's
talking
about
is
the
great
humiliation
and
ridicule
and
mental
anguish.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
close
because
she
alleged
malicious
prosecution.
that
was
timely
under
1983.
and
malicious
prosecution,
as
such,
i
read
them
saying,
is
actionable
under
section
1983.
mr.
michael
f.
close
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
but
i
think
that
is
the
question
that's
here.
mr.
michael
f.
close
and
actually,
there's
a
fair
amount
of
circuit
court
authority
which
would
support
the
idea
that
if
you
have
malicious
prosecution
under
common
law,
and
you
can
satisfy
1983,
that
you
therefore
have
a
section
1983
claim.
i
read
them
as
deciding
that
point
in
favor
of
the
respondent.
i
think
that
they
are
wrong,
but
that's
what
they...
that's
what
they
hold.
and
they
would
hardly
be
the
only
circuit
on
that
point.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
before...
she
was...
they
took
her
to
the
village
court.
village
court
is
only
at
night.
and
it
starts
at
6:30,
so
that
people
can
do
their
jobs
during
the
day,
and
then
they
go
at
night.
the
judge
was
on
trial.
and
she
was...
until
she
was
arraigned,
she
was
at
court.
but
that's
all
pre-arraignment.
and
for
the
cases
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
if,
if...
you
know,
if
new
york
law...
assuming
new
york
law
governs
on
that
point,
it's
all...
that
point
is
time
barred.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
assuming
now
we're
talking
about
everything
post-arraignment,
the
answer
is
no,
that
is
not
the...
that's
just
another
way
of
saying
that
i
was
a
defendant
in
a
frivolous
suit,
and
i
had
to
go
to
court
eight
or
nine
times,
which
is
a
45
minute
drive
from
where
she
lives.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes,
that
is
not...
our
first...
the
first
two
questions
on
which
the
petition
is
granted
is
that
the
right
to
be
free
of
frivolous
suits
is
not,
as
such,
part
of
the
liberty
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
i
don't
think...
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference...
this
is
a
criminal
case,
but
i
don't
think
there's
a
constitutional
difference
between
a
frivolous
criminal
case
and
a
frivolous
civil
case.
in
either
case
you're...
we
cite
in
our
opening--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true.
we
relied
on
gerstein
v.
pugh,
which
indicated
that
in
the
absence
of
an
allegation
that
you
had
a
burden
other
than
the
burden
to
appear
for
trial...
now,
my
answer
might
have
been
different
if...
if...
first
of
all,
if
she'd
been
incarcerated;
if
she
hadn't
been
released
on
her
own
recognizance;
if
she...
if
there
were
some
significant
restraint
other
than
the
mere
burden
of
appearing
for
trial,
my
answer
might
be
different.
but
based
on
gerstein
v.
pugh,
we
say
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
to
appear
for
trial
is...
is...
does
not
really...
does
not
of
itself
indicate
a
liberty
interest
within
the
meaning--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--well,
as
the
record
shows,
if
you
don't
appear,
eventually
they'll
send
out
a
warrant
letter?
mr.
michael
f.
close
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
if
she
continued
to
refuse
the
warrant,
yes,
she'd
eventually
be...
she
could
actually
be
put
in
jail.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
i
don't
consider
that
different
than
any
civil
case.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
distinguishes
this
from
the
civil
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief.
and
new
york
doesn't
even
recognize
a
cause
of
action
for
bringing
a
frivolous
civil
case.
and
there
are
just
as
equal
burdens
in
defending
a
frivolous
civil
case
as
in
defending
a
frivolous
criminal
case,
and
in
the
civil
case,
you
don't
have
any
remedy
at
all.
you
know,
the
exact
same
allegations...
malicious,
frivolous,
baseless;
you
knew
you
should
never
sue
me,
you
sued
me
anyway,
you
asked
for
millions
of
dollars...
doesn't
state
a
claim
for
relief
at
all.
and
we
therefore
claim
that
the
mere
allegation
that
you
were
subject
to
a
baseless
suit
is
in
not
itself--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
close
no.
mr.
michael
f.
close
because
they...
the...
she's
claiming
here
as...
that
there's
a,
you
know,
a
false
and
fraudulent
arrest--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--yes.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
if
that's
really
true,
then
i...
the
court
below
erred
in
dismissing
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
then
what
did
they
dismiss
when
they
dismissed?
mr.
michael
f.
close
no,
justice
stevens,
there
never
was--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--that's
true.
mr.
michael
f.
close
and
they
only
could
do
that
by
overlooking
their
earlier
holding.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
the
trouble
with
that--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--the
answer,
relying
on
my
reply
brief
at
16
and
17,
is
that,
no,
she
is...
we
cite,
in
fact,
a
case
under
new
york
law
where
you
can
recover
from
malicious
prosecution,
but
you
can't
recover
for
false
arrest.
that's
miller
v.
city
of
new
york.
and
miller
v.
city
of
new
york
answers
that
damage
question.
and
it
says,
19...
middle
of
page
19
in
my
brief...
plaintiff
must
establish
his
damages
resulted
from
malicious
prosecution,
and
not
from
the
false
imprisonment.
mr.
michael
f.
close
as
such.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
close
i
agree,
but
the
court
below
did
not.
mr.
michael
f.
close
that's
true.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
close
for
tort
purposes,
but
necessarily
for
statute
of
limitations
purposes.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
singleton
went
a
little
beyond
that.
singleton
also
held
you
look
to
state
rules
of
accrual
as
well.
but
they
were
consistent
with
what
they...
what
they...
what
they
deemed
to
be
any
federal
interest.
mr.
michael
f.
close
i'm
not.
mr.
michael
f.
close
i
agree.
and
singleton...
i
mean,
our
response
on
statute
of
limitations
is
that
singleton
v.
city
of
new
york
is
a
federal
law
case,
and
the
second
circuit
held
that
this
was
barred
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
so
it's
not
in
the
case.
and
as
to
the
malicious
prosecution
claim,
we
say
it's
not
a
species
of
liberty
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
at
all.
so
that's
timely
under
1983,
or
the
court
below
held
it
was
timely.
that
claim
is
just
not
a
claim
of
constitutional
dimension.
and
even
if--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--yes,
which
is
all
that's
remaining.
i
understand
the
court
below
would
be
holding
she
stated
a
claim
for
relief.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
justice
white,
when
you
use
the
word
"evidence"
as
opposed
to
"damages",
evidence
may
come
in
because
it
may
be
relevant
to
something.
she
has
to
prove
conspiracy.
the
arrest
might
be
proof
of
the
conspiracy.
it's
not
part
of...
she's
not
recovering
damages--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--could
it?
i
mean,
yes,
in
some
sense,
if
she
were
kept
in
jail.
it
doesn't
answer
the
statute
of
limitations
problem.
mr.
michael
f.
close
before
her
arraignment.
and
arraignment
separated
the
one
tort
from
the
other,
for
the
purposes
of
recovering
damages.
mr.
michael
f.
close
well,
the
court
below
held
new
york
law
governs--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--yes,
that's--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--that's
what
the
court
below
held.
i
think
it's
incorrect.
mr.
michael
f.
close
but
the
court
below
held
the
two
claims
are
virtually
identical.
and
in
fact
we
quote
that
language
in
a
subsequent
case,
where
they
say
that
the
elements
of
the
tort
are
identical.
we
say,
that's
wrong,
because
you
have
to
show
a
federal
right.
and
we
don't
see
any
federal,
constitutional
claim
at
stake
here.
and
the
mere
claim
that
you
were
subjected
to
a
baseless
suit,
which
is
the
gravamen
of
malicious
prosecution,
is
not
constitution.
and
if--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--well,
to
make
a--
mr.
michael
f.
close
--if
she
had
said,
lock,
they
prosecuted
me
because
of
my
race,
she
would
have
a
1983
claim,
not
because
there's
a
generalized
guarantee
against
frivolous
lawsuits,
but
because
there
is
a
guarantee
against
different
treatment
because
of
your
race.
if
she
said,
they
prosecuted
me
maliciously
because
i
was
a
democrat
or
a
republican,
or
whatever,
then
there'd
be
a
first
amendment
claim.
if
she
said,
you
know,
they
prosecuted
me
because
i'm
protesting
the
war,
or
anything
like
that,
there
could
be...
i
made
that
concession
below,
and
the
court
thought
it
was
dispositive.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
hold
that
malicious
prosecution
could
never
be
actionable
as
a
matter
of
1983;
i
am
asking
you
to
hold
that
the
bare
bones
allegation
that
the
suit
is
frivolous,
okay,
meritless,
is
not
as
such
a
species
of
liberty
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
because
the
constitution
does
not
extent
to
you
a
guarantee
against
frivolous
suits
as
such.
and
that's
all
i
see
in
this
case
for
this
plaintiff.
alternatively,
relying
on
hudson
and
parratt,
we
say
you
have
an
adequate
state
law
remedy
anyway,
and
her
only
problem
is
that
it's
time
barred.
and
because
you
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
state
law,
even
if
it
is
a
due
process
violation,
relying
on
say,
ponner
v.
coughlin,
hudson,
and
parratt,
that...
so
what?
i
don't
see
the
due
process
clause
as
being
implicated?
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes,
your
honor,
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
michael
f.
close
no,
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
michael
f.
close
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
f.
close
answering
mr.
justice
scalia's
question,
there
is
no
tort
of
conspiracy
recognized
by
new
york
law.
they
contend
that
mrs.
conway
had
sufficient
funds,
and
that
if
the
check...
if
he
had
rushed
down
to
deposit
the
check,
it
would
have
cleared.
the
record
doesn't
sustain
that
contention.
she
had
already
drawn
against
the
funds
that
the
account
shows
as
of
5/10/77.
so
it
would
be
true
that
the
check
would
clear
only
if
the
check
no.
154,
which
is
at
stake,
was
presented
under
the
bank's
rules,
before
153,
152.
as
soon
as
any
of
the
earlier
written
checks
had
cleared,
she
would
be
insufficient.
that,
under
the
new
york
statute,
is
insufficient
funds
when
she
wrote
it,
because
the
statute
requires
that
you
have
sufficient
funds
that
you
haven't
already
drawn
upon.
as
far
as
the
other
theories
of
liability...
sixth
amendment
and
docket
notation...
they're
just
not
properly
here,
because
they
would
lead
to
a
very
different
judgment
than
the
judgment
we
are
appealing.
the
holding
below
is
that
whatever
is
common
law,
malicious
prosecution,
under
new
york
law,
is
necessarily
a
1983
case.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
close
yes,
but
the
rationale
of
the
decision
below,
in
response
to
my
argument
that
paul
v.
davis,
baker
v.
mccollan,
and
gerstein
v.
pugh,
which
said
malicious
prosecution
is
not
a
claim
under
1983,
the
court
below
said,
no,
look,
this
is
new
york
law.
it's
valid
under
new
york
law.
his
theory
of
sixth
amendment
would
lead
to
a
very
different
kind
of
judgment,
and
so
would
his
docket
notation
theory.
so
they're
not
arguments
that
would
sustain
the
ruling
below,
and
therefore,
i
don't
think
that
they're
properly
presented.
and
for
the
reasons
we
state
in
our
brief,
we
don't
think
substantive
due
process
has
anything
to
do
with
the
case.
we
don't
think
that
mrs.
conway
has
anything
in
common
with
mrs.
roe.
you
know,
she's
just
not
within...
she's
not
within
the
realm
of
privacy
interests,
which
are
protected
by
that
doctrine.
and
she
is
invoking
the
doctrine
because
she
wants
an
additional
federal
remedy
to
what's
already
adequate
under
state
law.
she's
not
like
mrs.
roe
who
comes
here
because
she
has
no
remedy
under
state
law
at
all.
so
mrs.
conway's
complaint
can't
be
considered
under
the
substantive
process
doctrine.
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions
about
the
record,
the
petitioner
will
rest.
