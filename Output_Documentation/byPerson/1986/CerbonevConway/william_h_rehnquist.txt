chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
cerbone
against
conway.
mr.
close,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
false
arrest
and
malicious
prosecution
are
not
themselves
constitutional
claims.
you
could
have
a
constitutional
claim,
i
would
think,
simply
for
wrongful
deprivation
of
liberty,
which
is
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
these
people
were
detained
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
the
second
circuit
obviously
ruled
in
favor
of
the
respondents
on
some
point,
because
it's
you
who
are
here
and
not
they.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
basis
upon
which
you
think
the
second
circuit
ruled
in
favor
of
the
respondent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
was
their
reason?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here,
of
course,
you
don't
have
merely
what
might
be
normal
elements
of
malicious
prosecution.
you
have
a
substantial
period
of
detention.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
close.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
miller,
do
you
think
that
where
a
person
is
not
convicted,
that
speedy
trial
analysis
really
adds
much
to
the
basic
concept
of
deprivation
of
liberty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
surely
you
could
recover
for
however
long
or
however
short
it
is
if
you
can
show
simply
a
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opponent
relies
heavily
on
the
hudson
v.
palmer
and
parratt
v.
taylor
for
the
proposition
that
new
york
law
provided
adequate
remedies
for
this
detention.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
parratt
went
on
to
say,
i
think...
and
i
think
hudson
v.
palmer
reiterated
it...
that
in
some
situations
you
had
to
look
at
the
state
remedy
that
was
provided
for
the
petitioner's
claim
to
decide
whether
there
had
been
any
deprivation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
hudson
involved
a
claim
of
intentional
abuse
of
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
mr.
close,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
close.
the
case
is
submitted.
