on
that
point,
the
respondent
tells
us
that
under
new
york
law
the
respondent's
arrest
is
part
of
her
malicious
prosecution
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
new
york
law,
an
arrest
made
without
a
warrant
and
lacking
probable
cause
gives
a
cause
of
action
for
malicious
prosecution
in
new
york.
is
that
right?
you
concede
that
that's
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you'd
answer
my
question,
apparently
what
the
respondents
tell
us
is
that
new
york
law
would
give
a
cause
of
action
for
malicious
prosecution
for
the
making
of
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
and
lacking
in
probable
cause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
suppose
that
they're
right,
and
that
under
new
york
law
a
false
arrest
claim
is
part
of
malicious
prosecution.
do
the...
are
you
suggesting
that
we
then
have
to
redefine
what
is
malicious
prosecution
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
new
york
law
controlling?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
close,
part
and
parcel
of
the
conduct
that
underlies
the
malicious
prosecution
claim
in
this
case
is
that
a
phony
criminal
charge
was
filed,
and
that
the
individual
charged
was
required
to
appear
and
sit
around
the
court
for
a
long
time
waiting
to
enter
a
plea,
and
was
required
to
go
back
i
don't
know
how
many
times...
eight,
nine,
whatever
it
was...
many
times,
in
addition
to
the
reputational
injury.
so
the
sum
total
of
what
underlies
the
malicious
prosecution
here
is
a
great
many
appearances
that
were
alleged
to
be
unlawfully
imposed
on
this
person,
and
improperly,
because
it
was
a
false
charge
to
begin
with.
do
you
think
there's
any
deprivation
of
liberty
involved
in
that
kind
of
a
process?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
court
has
held
for
example
that
being
suspended
from
public
school
as
a
student
for
ten
days
or
so
is
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
and
yet
you
say
that
being
hauled
in
to
the
criminal
court
on
a
false
charge
and
made
to
wait
and
appear
and
reappear
is
not;
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
criminal
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case,
though,
has
to
appear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
suppose
that
damages
can
be
collected
for
that
as
part
of
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
assume
that
the
courts
below
didn't
address
the
sixth
amendment
claims
at
all.
they
would
be
open.
they
just
weren't
considered,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
don't
have
to
consider
that?
i
mean,
that's
separate
and
apart
and
not
yet
addressed.
what
we
have
before
us
is
what--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
due
process
claim?
