chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
two
consolidated
cases,
no.
85-1222,
icc
against
texas,
et
al.,
and
no.
85-1267,
missour-kansas-texas
railraod
company
against
texas.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
taranto.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
is
that
explicit
in
the
statute,
mr.
taranto?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
taranto,
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
because
you
answered
my
question
earlier.
but
could
you
again
give
me
that
section...
could
you
tell
me
what
page
of
your
appendix
or
petition
that
section
is
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
something
that
critical
was
not
included
in
the
relevant
statutes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
that
the
fifth
circuit
mentioned
the
provision
which
you
referred
me
to
earlier.
did
the
government
argue
that
provision
to
the
fifth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
roper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
did...
the
act
does
exempt
intrastate
transportation
by
motor,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
by
motor
carrier?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
phrase
that
the
fifth
circuit
relied
upon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
language
in
the
act
that
allows
states
to
regulate
intrastate
motor
transportation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
where
the
argument
is
really.
because
if
it
is
transportation
provided
by
motor
carriers,
it
isn't
subject
to
that
kind
of
market
forces
analysis
that
the
other
forms
of
motor
transportation
are?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roper.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
rodriguez.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
say
a
railroad
is
a
railroad.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rodriguez.
mr.
taranto,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
interstate
commerce
commission
against
texas
and
a
related
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
