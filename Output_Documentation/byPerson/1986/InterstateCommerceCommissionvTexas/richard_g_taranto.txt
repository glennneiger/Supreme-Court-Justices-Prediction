mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
one
particular
form
of
mixed
train-truck
transportation,
and
whether
the
interstate
commerce
commission
could
properly
allocate
this
particular
form
of
mixed
service
to
the
system
of
rail
carrier
regulation,
rather
than
the
system
of
motor
carrier
regulation.
specifically,
the
transportation
at
issue
in
this
case
is
tofc
service,
trailer-on-flatcar
or
container-on-flatcar
service,
which
involves
a
rail
portion,
during
which
the
trailer
or
container
rides
on
a
railroad
flatcar,
and
a
motor
portion,
during
which
the
trailer
or
container
is
pulled
by
motor
vehicle.
even
more
specifically,
this
case
concerns
only
one
particular
form
of
tofc
service,
a
category
of
what
has
long
been
called
plan
ii
service,
where
the
entire
service
is
provided
by
an
interstate
rail
carrier
on
equipment
owned
and
operated
by
the
rail
carrier.
the
icc
decided
in
this
case
that
that
particular
form
of
plan
ii
service
should
be
subjected
to
the
system
of
rail
carrier
regulation,
and
not
to
the
system
of
motor
carrier
regulation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
that
trucks
that
pull
the
trailers
or
containers
on
the
road
in
this
case
are
owned
by
the
rail
carrier
itself.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
you
have
to
decide
that
that
is
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier
within
the
meaning
of
the
staggers
act.
my
argument
today
is--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i'm
sorry,
justice?
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
it
is
true
that
the
statute
generally
uses
the
term,
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier
in
various
places.
and
that
it
is
not
entirely
consistent
in
its
use
of
language.
but
the
phrase,
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier,
under
the
literal
definition
of
the
word
transportation,
includes
motor
vehicle
as
well
as
rail
movement.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
decided
in
this
case
that
for
the
entire
portion
of
tofc
service,
both
the
motor
and
the
truck
portion,
that
the
proper
system
of
regulation
for
the
entire
service
is
the
rail
carrier
provisions
and
not
the
motor
carrier
provisions.
this
case
arose
as
a
result
of
congress'
passage
of
the
staggers
act
in
1980.
that
statute,
which
extended
and
furthered
the
deregulation
policies
first
put
into
place
in
the
mid-1970s,
made
major
changes
in
the
system
of
rail
carrier
regulation
in
the
united
states.
the
general
findings
and
policies
set
forth
in
the
statute
are
important
to
this
case,
because
the
state
expressly
provides
that
individual
provisions
of
the
entire
interstate
commerce
act
must
be
interpreted
to
further
the
declared
national
rail
transportation
policy.
the
staggers...
in
the
staggers
act,
congress
expressly
found
that
overregulation
had
contributed
to
the
financial
plight
of
the
rail
industry,
and
that
much
regulation
was
today
unnecessary,
largely
because
transportation
had
become
much
more
competitive.
it
then
went
on
to
set
out
a
new
national
rail
transportation
policy,
which
emphasized
deregulation
at
the
federal
level;
maximum
possible
reliance
on
market
forces
in
rail
carriers
providing
transportation;
uniformity
between
state
and
federal
regulation;
and,
in
particular,
the
promotion
of
intermodal
transportation.
congress
went
even
one
step
further,
and
expressly
amended
the
national
transportation
policy
that
applies
to
other
modes
of
transportation,
to
give
the
rail
policy
express
priority.
that
policy
must
govern
whenever
a
government
action
has
an
impact
on
rail
carriers.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
in
the
very
first
words
of
section
10101,
the
general
national
transportation
policy,
says
that
the
following
shall
govern
except
when
policy
has
an
impact
on
rail
carriers,
in
which
case
the
specific
rail
carrier
policy
will
govern.
in
its
first
act
pursuant
to
the
staggers
act,
new...
the
staggers
act
new
exemption
provision,
the
icc
determined,
in
this
case,
that
both
the
truck
and
train
portions
of
rail-provided
tofc
service
should
be
exempt.
it
took
this
action
pursuant
to
two...
to
one
of
the
two
important
provisions
of
the
staggers
act
that
is
in
issue
in
this
case.
the
exemption
provision
that
the
staggers
act
added
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
changed
what
had
been
the
historical
practice.
historically,
all
rail
carrier
activities
were
subject
to
an
extensive
system
of
regulation,
covering
the
rates
charged
and
most
other
aspects
of
rail
carrier
activities.
in
1976,
congress
took
one
step
and
granted
the
commission
power
to
exempt
activities.
but
there
was
a
limit
in
that
provision.
only
activities
of
limited
scope
could
be
exempt.
the
icc
began
considering
whether
tofc
service,
fell
within
that
exemption,
and
congress
specifically
noted
the
potential
availability
of
the
exemption
provision
as
written
when
it
was
considering
the
staggers
act.
but
in
the
staggers
act,
congress
expanded
the
exemption
power,
and
specifically
directed
the
commission
to
examine
rail
activities
to
determine
when
regulation
was
no
longer
necessary
to
protect
shippers
against
an
abuse
of
market
power.
congress
also
added
to
the
exemption
provision
a
specific
section
designed
to
promote
the
exemption
of
rail...
of
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier
as
part
of
intermodal
service.
the
second
important
provision
of
the
staggers
act--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
don't
believe
that
the
petition
includes
the
general
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
is
included
in
the
statutes;
not
in
the
appendix
here.
in
section
10101,
the
general
national
transportation
policy,
which
comes
just
before
10101a,
the
language
i
was
referring
to
appears.
the
pre-emption
provision
of
the
staggers
act
is
the
second
important
provision
in
this
case.
and
that
provision
worked
an
even
more
fundamental
change
in
the
system
of
rail
carrier
regulation.
historically,
an
interstate
rail
carrier
was
subjected
to
a
dual
system
of
regulation.
and
intrastate
shipment
was
initially
subjected
to
state
regulation,
with
appeal
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
to
simplify
matters,
only
if
the
state
action
discriminated
against
or
unduly
burdened
interstate
commerce.
congress
radically
altered
the
balance
of
federal
and
government
authority
in
the
staggers
act.
after
the
staggers
act,
a
state
was
permitted
to
continue
regulation
intrastate
transportation
only
if
it
did
so
in
accordance
with
federal
standards
and
procedures,
and
it
had
obtained
certification
from
the
icc
to
continue
that
regulation.
in
this
case,
texas
has
been
denied
certification.
it
was
denied
certification
while
the
icc
decision
that
is
at
issue
here
was
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
precise
chronology
is
as
follows.
the
icc
granted
the
exemption
to
tofc
service,
both
the
motor
and
rail
portions,
in
1981.
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
american
trucking
association's
case
of
1981.
in
the
early
eighties
texas,
like
many
states,
had
provisional
authority
to
continue
regulating.
and
under
that
provisional
authority,
it
determined
that
for
intrastate
shipments
it
retained
the
authority
to
regulate
the
motor
portions
of
tofc
service.
the
icc
disagreed
with
that
decision
by
texas,
and
that
decision
was
in
turn--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
icc
said
that
it's
1981
exemption--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
when
that
case
went
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
transportation
involved
in
the
earlier
case
was
interstate
transportation;
that
the
shipments
there
crossed
state
lines
during
the
entire...
at
some
point
during
the
single
tofc
service.
in
this
case,
they
said
a
different
analysis
is
required
when
the
service
is
purely
intrastate.
and
the
fifth
circuit
determined
that
intrastate
motor
portions
constituted
transportation
provided
by
a
motor
carrier,
subject
to
the
motor
carrier
act,
which
expressly
reserves
such
activity
to
state
regulation.
it
is
our
position
that
the
fifth
circuit
decision
was
wrong
because
it
took
too
simplistic
a
view
of
the
statutory
scheme,
and
because
it
failed
to
give
the
icc
the
deference
it
is
due
in
making
an
allocation
decision,
a
decision
about
where
to
allocate
an
inherently
mixed
form
of
transportation
in
a
complex
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i'm
not
aware
that
the
government
made
any
argument
based
on
the
express
priority
given
to
the
rail
carrier
policy.
we
showed
in
our
brief
that
the
language
of
the
two
or
three
particular
provisions
at
issue
in
this
case
can
bear
the
construction
that
the
commission
gave
it.
first
of
all,
the
motor
vehicle
portion
of
tofc
service
in
fact
constitutes
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier,
because
transportation
is
given
a
broad
definition
in
the
statute
that
encompasses
not
just
rail
but
also
motor
vehicle
movement.
second,
when
a
rail
carrier
provides
motor
vehicle
transportation,
as
an
adjunct
to,
incidental
to,
its
rail
transportation,
it
need
not
automatically
become
transformed
into
a
motor
carrier.
not
all
motor
vehicle
movement
is
by
definition
movement
by
a
motor
carrier.
the
particular
provisions
at
issue
here,
of
course,
can't
be
read
in
isolation,
as
this
court...
this
court's
approach
in
its
american
trucking
association's
case
of
1967,
we
think,
took
the
proper
approach.
first
of
all,
the
statutory
scheme
simply
does
not
divide
the
world
of
motor
vehicle
movement
and
rail
movement
according
to
the
same
line
that
the
statutory
scheme
is
generally
divided
between
motor
carriers
and
rail
carriers.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
fifth
circuit
rested
its
decision
on
the
view
that
this
was
transportation
provided
by
a
motor
carrier.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
icc
decision
in
this
case
itself
does
not
reflect
that...
that
argument.
i'm
afraid
i'm
just
unaware
of
what
arguments
were
made
in
the
proceeding
leading
up
to
the
icc
decision.
the
opinion
itself
does
not
reflect
that.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
we
do
know
the
view
of
the
icc
that
both
the
motor
and
truck
portion
is-properly
brought
within
the
rail
carrier
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
icc
decision
itself
does
not
speak
about
the
motor
carrier
act
provision.
it
does
speak
about
the
motor
carrier
act,
but
not
about
the
particular
reservation
of
state
authority.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
texas
today
remains
the
only
state
to
have
been
denied
certification.
there
was
a
long
process
in
which
many
states
applied
for
certification.
many
of
those
states
were
eventually
granted
certification.
some
in
the
course
of
the
application
process
dropped
out,
and
decided
that
they
would
no
longer
continue
seeking
certification.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
certainly,
texas
is
larger
than
most
states,
but
other
states
have
an
enormous
amount
of
intrastate
movement.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
the
specific
question,
whether
congress
has
ever
addressed
itself
to
whether
truck
movement
can
be
encompassed
in
the
rail
carrier
provisions
has
a
fairly
clear
answer.
congress
has
simply
never
said
anything
on
that
subject.
what
congress
has
said
is
that
it
sought
to
promote
intermodal
transportation,
both
in
the
specific
exemption
provision
of
the
staggers
act
in
adding,
as
part
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980,
the
promotion
of
intermodal
transportation,
to
the
general
national
transportation
policy;
and
in
taking
a
variety
of
other
actions.
when
one
turns,
finally,
to
the
general
rail
carrier
policy
set
out
in
the
staggers
act,
nothing
could
be
clear
that...
than
that
the
icc
decision
in
this
case
furthers
that
policy.
the
icc
decision
here
furthers
the
deregulatory
policy;
the
policy
of
ensuring...
of
eliminating
disparities
between
federal
and
state
regulation;
and
the
policy
of
promoting
intermodal
transportation.
it
is
our
view
that
because
there
is
nothing
specifically
in
the
statute
contrary
to
the
icc
construction
of
the
statute;
and
because
the
icc
decision
here
furthers
the
national
rail
transportation
policy;
that
the
icc
decision
was
correct,
and
that
the
fifth
circuit
decision
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
nothing
further.
