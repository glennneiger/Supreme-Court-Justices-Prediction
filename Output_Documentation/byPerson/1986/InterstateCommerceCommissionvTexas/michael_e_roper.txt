mr.
michael
e.
roper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
narrow
question
of
whether
congress
delegated
power
to
the
icc
to
exempt
the
motor
portion
of
intrastate
tofc
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
icc
does
have,
and
did
properly
exercise,
the
power
to
exempt
both
the
motor
and
rail
portion
of
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier,
when
that
transportation
was
on
a
interstate
basis.
likewise,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
icc
could
and
did
exempt
the
rail
portion
of
intrastate
tofc-cofc
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier.
railroad
petitioners,
all
of
whom
are
interstate
rail
carriers
operating
in
texas,
concur
in
the
analysis
made
by
the
government,
and
that
will
not
be
repeated
here,
hopefully.
instead,
my
primary
focus
will
be
on
what
the
practical
effect
of
the
decision
below
will
be,
if
that
decision
is
allowed
to
stand.
petitioning
railroads
will
suffer
real
and
tangible
harm
if
the
motor
portion
of
intrastate
tofc
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier,
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
railroad
commission
of
texas.
while
it
is
true
that
petitioners
are
not
presently
engaged
in
a
large
amount
of
that
type
of
transportation,
one
reason
for
that
is
the
uncertainty
created
by
the
decision
below.
railroad
petitioners
view
complete
intrastate
tofc-cofc
transportation
as
a
necessary
component
of
their
ability
to
be
fully
effective
competitors
in
the
state
of
texas
and
other
large
states
where
there
is
a
potential
for
long-haul
transportation
by
rail.
the
major
effect
of
the
decision
below
will
be
to
prevent
railroad
petitioners
from
competing
with
intrastate
motor
carriers.
texas
has
essentially
conceded
in
its
brief
that
its
aim
is
just
that,
to
protect
intrastate
motor
carriers
from
competition.
one
wonders
why
texas
is
so
concerned
about
protecting
an
industry,
when
that
industry
apparently
is
not
itself
concerned.
the
texas
intrastate
motor
carriers
have
not
appeared
at
any
stage
of
this
case
before
the
icc
or
the
courts.
we
believe
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
motor
carriers
would
have
contested
this
matter
if
they
were
truly
fearful
of
this
competition.
in
any
event,
railroads
will
not
be
able
to
effectively
compete
because
of
the
higher
costs
and
less
flexibility
associated
with
transportation
that
is
partially
regulated
and
partially
deregulated.
mr.
michael
e.
roper
well,
you
would
think
so--
mr.
michael
e.
roper
--we
will
be
able...
if
the
motor
portion
is
deregulated
as
the
rail
portion,
we
will
be
able
to
provide
additional
competition
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
michael
e.
roper
well,
given
the
history
of
the
railroad
commission,
i
could
certainly
understand
why
they
would
put
that
trust
there.
but
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
an
either/or
situation.
tofc-cofc
transportation
involves
the
movement
of
usually
two
trailers
or
containers
on
one
flatcar.
under
the
tofc
exemption
adopted
by
the
icc,
a
portion
of
the
movement
must
be
over
the
rail
in
order
for
the
rail
carrier
to
be
able
to
provide
over-the-road
motor
vehicle
service
in
its
own
trucks.
both
interstate
and
intrastate
tofc-cofc
shipments
move
on
the
same
flatcars,
in
the
same
trains,
and
receive
the
same
physical
handling.
however,
if
the
decision
below
stands,
the
intrastate
tofc-cofc
shipments
will
be
subject
to
economic
regulation
by
the
rct,
railroad
commission,
while
the
interstate
shipments
will
be
exempt
from
economic
regulation.
the
example
discussed
in
railroad's
opening
brief
is
illustrative
of
the
problem.
that
example
concerned
a
shipper
making
an
intrastate
shipment
from
houston
to
texarkana,
texas,
and
a
shipper
making
a
tofc
shipment
from
houston
to
texarkana,
arkansas.
the
rail
carrier
chosen
by
the
first
shipper
would
move
the
trailers
over
its
tracks
to
dallas,
and
then
would
have
to
obtain
either
a
certificate
to
operate
as
a
motor
carrier
to
move
the
trailers
to
texarkana,
texas,
or
would
have
to
use
another
certificated
motor
carrier
for
that
portion
of
the
move.
the
interstate
shipper,
using--
mr.
michael
e.
roper
--that
is
true,
but
in
this
case,
congress
has
form
a
different
form
of
regulation.
mr.
michael
e.
roper
well,
i
think
it's
illustrative
of
the
problem
you
have
with
the
dual
regulatory
system,
that
congress
has
concluded
was
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
rail
carrier
industry.
and
that's
why
they
did
what
they
did.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
texas
did
not
dispute
the
validity
of
this
example,
but
rather
stated
that
the
disparity
was
condoned
by
congress.
we
believe
that
statement
to
be
erroneous.
because
congress,
in
adopting
the
staggers
act,
specifically
found
that
separate
state
and
federal
regulatory
policies
were
to
be
eliminated.
congress
therefore
preempted
state
regulation
of
intrastate
rail
transportation
except
to
allow
certified
states
to
regulate
in
accordance
with
federal
standards
and
procedures.
texas,
of
course,
because
of
its
decertification,
does
not
even
have
that
power.
if
the
decision
below
stands,
the
policy
of
uniformity
between
federal
and
state
regulation
will
be
frustrated.
that
result
would
be
contrary
to
the
stated
policy
in
49
u.s.c.
10101a
of
assuring
that
intrastate
regulation
is
consistent
with
federal
standards.
we
also
believe
that
the
decision
below
conflicts
with
this
court's
holding
in
the
transcontinental
gas
pipe
line
case.
as
this
court
held,
once
the
congress
has
decided
not
to
regulate
in
an
area
such
as
economic
regulation,
the
states
are
not
free
to
step
in
and
regulate.
texas
is
attempting
to
do
just
that
by
asserting
that
the
icc
does
not
have
the
power
to
exempt
the
full
intrastate
tofc
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier.
the
staggers
act
expressly
adopted
the
policy
to
rely
on
market
forces,
rather
than
economic
regulation.
and
we
believe
texas'
attempt
to
frustrate
that
police
is
contrary
to
the
holdings
in
transco.
mr.
michael
e.
roper
by
motor?
mr.
michael
e.
roper
no--
mr.
michael
e.
roper
--well,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
icc
and
congress
had
to
be
talking
only
about
interstate
transportation
when
they
were
talking
about
motor
and
rail
portions.
mr.
michael
e.
roper
yes,
there
is.
but
this
is
not
transportation
provided
by
motor
carriers.
mr.
michael
e.
roper
not
to
the
degree,
although
the
1980
motor
carrier
act,
i
think,
did
loosen
up
the
regulatory
control
significantly
for
interstate
motor
carriers.
but
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
that
was
adopted
by
congress,
where
they
said,
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier,
is
exactly
covering
this
type
of
transportation.
these
are
all
rail
carriers.
it
is
transportation
provided
by
these
rail
carriers.
and
beyond
that,
the
first
portion
of
49
u.s.c.
10505
talks
about
matters
relating
to
transportation
provided
by
rail
carriers.
and
this
is
certainly
a
matter
that
relates
to
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier.
you
must
have
a
prior
or
subsequent
move
over
the
rail
in
order
for
this
exemption
to
apply.
so
i
don't
think
it's...
the
construction
of
the
statute,
you
know,
is
clear
that
transportation
which,
as
defined
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
does
include
motor
vehicle,
when
it's
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier,
it
falls
exactly
within
the
statute.
and
that
is
our
position.
that's
all
i
have.
thank
you.
