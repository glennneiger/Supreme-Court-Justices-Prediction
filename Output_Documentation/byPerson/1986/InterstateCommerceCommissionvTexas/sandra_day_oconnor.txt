mr.
taranto,
part
of
the
equipment
is
trailer
rigs,
truck-trailer
rigs
owned
by
the
railroad?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
it
travels
over
the
road
in
tractor-trailer
rigs
owned
by
the
railroad;
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
you
to
prevail,
we
have
to
decide
that's
a
form
of
rail
service?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
rodriguez,
if
the
motor
portion
of
interstate
tofc
movements
can
be
exempted,
why
doesn't
that
necessarily
mean
that
the
motor
portion
of
intrastate
movement
is
also
transportation
by
a
rail
carrier?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
there's
some
question
about
it,
don't
we
owe
some
deference
to
the
icc
as
the
agency
administering
the
staggers
act?
