justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
the
anomaly
present
if
you
were
just
a
motor
carrier
and
you
didn't
have
a
rail
involved?
one
going
to
texarkana,
texas
is
subject
to
the
texas
commission.
one
going
across
the
state
line
is
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
i
don't
think
the
anomaly
adds
much
to
your
argument
is
all
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
at
that
point,
suppose
that
instead
of
granting
an
exemption,
the
icc
had
felt
there
was
a
danger
that
the
railroad
would
have
a
monopoly
and
would
gouge
the
shippers,
and
wanted
to
regulate
rather
than
exempt
the
entire
tofc
or
whatever
you
call
it
combined
type
of
service,
including
the
intrastate
motor
carriage
portion.
your
position
is,
they
couldn't
have
done
that
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
you'd
have
the
same--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--transportation
at
issue.
but
instead
of
ordering
the
state
to
exempt,
the
icc
had
said,
we'd
like
to
regulate
this,
because
we're
afraid
the
railroad's
going
to
gouge
the
shippers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
say
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction
there
either?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
only
the
rail
portion
is
interstate
and
the
motor
portion
is
intrastate.
under
your
view
who
has
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rodriguez,
can
i
interrupt
you
just
a
second?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
making
a
constitutional
argument
in
this
case,
or
is
it
just
a
question
of
statutory
construction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
not
contest
the
power...
if
everything
were
spelled
out
just
as
the
government,
your
opponent,
says
it
is,
you
wouldn't
contest
the
power
of
congress
to
deregulate
this
particular
kind
of
transportation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
say
you
go
to
congress
to
preserve
your
power
to
regulate.
what
you're
saying
is,
your
adversaries
did
not
persuade
congress
to
take
that
power
away
from
you.
and
they
say
that
the
statute
clearly
did
take
it
away
if
you
read
it
literally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn't
have
to
have
the
initiative
to
go
to
congress
to
preserve
your
regulatory
power.
you're
really
saying
they
didn't
accomplish
what
they
say
they
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
that
10521b
says
except
as
provided
in
these
other
sections.
and
those
are
the
very
sections
that
the
icc
relies
on
as
taking
it
away,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
11501e
and...
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
no,
the
question
is
whether
this
is
intrastate
transportation
provided
by
a
motor
carrier.
that's
what
1025b(1)
exempts.
so
you
still
boil
down
to
the
question,
is
this
transportation
provided
by
this
railroad,
quote,
transportation
provided
by
a
motor
carrier,
within
the
meaning
of
10521b.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
is
this
a
rail
carrier
or
a
motor
carrier?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume
the
interest
of
the
state
of
texas
is
to
prevent
this
intermodal
transportation
from
cutting
the
rates
below
the
floor
that
applies
to
the
motor
carriers,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
want
to
protect
the
motor
carriers
from
cut-rate
competition
by
the
intermodal
carrier;
isn't
that
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
it's
an
attempt
to
protect
the
carriers
from
what
they
would
regard
as
unfair
competition
by
an
unregulated
carrier.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
raises
a
narrow
issue
of
a
statutory
construction,
it
involves
the
question
whether
the
railroad
commission
of
texas
in
regulate
a
narrow
segment
of
what
is
known
as
piggyback
service
transportation
of
freight
on
a
partly
on
a
railroad
flatcar
and
partly
being
hold
by
a
motor
carrier
in
a
continuous
movement.
the
issue
blows
down
to
whether
when
it
is
the
services
performed
by
an
interstate
rail
carrier
and
the
movement
itself
is
entirely
within
the
state
of
texas.
whether
the
portion
of
the
movement
that
has
provided
by
trucks
and
be
regulated
by
texas
and
it
turns
on
whether
that
portion
of
the
movement
is
considered
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier
or
by
a
motor
carrier.
and
for
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
in
as
much
as
equipment
is
entirely
own
by
the
railroad
at
the
time
and
it
is
a
real
carrier
within
the
meaning
of
the
statue,
that
it
is
a
rail
carrier
transportation.
and
therefore
an
exemption
for
this
portion
of
the
movement
ordered
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
deprives
the
state
of
the
texas
of
the
power
to
regulate
this
portion.
and
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
it
held
to
the
contrary.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
