justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
correct
that
the
argument
on
which
the
fifth
circuit
based
its
decision
had
not
been
presented
to
the
icc?
is
that
right?
in
the
proceedings
before
the
icc
did
texas
make
the
argument
that
ultimately
prevailed
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
a
motor
carrier.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
really
know
the
views
of
the
icc
on
this
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
really
understand
that.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
either
it's...
you're
saying,
it's
important
to
you,
but
it's
not
important
to
them.
it
seems
to
me
if
it's
important
to
you,
it
ought
to
be
important
to
the
texas
motor
carriers,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
make
money
and
they're
not
going
to
lose
any.
it
really
doesn't
work
that
way,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
texas
truckers
must
lose
money.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
pick
one
argument
or
the
other.
maybe
the
texas
truckers
just
trust
the
state
of
texas
to
preserve
their
interests.
justice
antonin
scalia
textually,
your
argument
comes
down
to
the
argument
that
this
transportation
is
not
being...
is
being
provided
by
a
motor
carrier
rather
than
by
a
railroad;
isn't
that
what
it
all
boils
down
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
being
provided
by
a
railroad.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
how
could
you
get
icc
jurisdiction
over
the
motor
carrier
portion
of
interstate
transportation.
do
you
assert
that
the
icc
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
over
that
either?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
the
issue.
the
issue
is,
what
is
transportation
by
a
motor
common
carrier,
and
what
is
transportation
by
a
railroad?
does
it
mean...
it's
easy
to
identify
what's
a
railroad
or
what's
a
motor
carrier.
what's
hard,
and
there's
really
no...
you
could
go
either
way...
is
whether
transportation
by
a
railroad
means
only
rail
transportation
by
a
railroad
or
truck
transportation
by
a
railroad;
then,
likewise,
whether
transportation
by
a
motor
carrier
means...
would
any
problems
arise
if
we
adopted
the
government's
meaning
for
transportation
by
a
railroad,
by
a
rail
carrier,
i
assume
you'd
have
to
adopt
the
same
position
for
the
meaning
of
transportation
by
a
motor
carrier,
wherever
it
appears
in
the
act;
that
is,
wherever
the
act
says
anything
relating
to
transportation
by
a
motor
carrier,
it
would
include
rail
transportation
by
a
motor
carrier,
so
long
as
the
rails
are
owned
by
a
motor
carrier.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
make
the
government
uncomfortable
in
any
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
lends
itself
to
that
meaning,
certainly.
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier
means
any
form
of
transportation
the
rail
carrier
provides.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
have
it
readily
in
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
wait
a
minute.
do
you
say
10505f
refers
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
refer
to...
you're
not
saying
that
refers
to
the
truck
portion
of
what
the
railroad
provides?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
you've
given
away
your
case.
because
they
use
the
same
language
in
f
that
they
do
in
a,
that
is,
transportation
that
is
provided
by
a
rail
carrier.
and
you're
saying,
in
f,
it
means
truck
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
modified
by
that.
it
says,
except
transportation
that
is
provided
by
a
rail
carrier,
which
phrase,
you
assert,
includes
only
rail
transportation,
as
a
part
of
a
continuous
intermodal
movement.
that
would
mean
only
the
rail
portion
of
the
continuous
intermodal
movement.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
is
it
the
truck
portion
of
it?
if
it
can
be
the
truck
portion
of
it
there,
then
you
can
read
it
the
same
way
up
in
a.
i
thought
your
whole
case
hinges
upon
the
fact
that
the
phrase,
transportation
that
is
provided
by
a
rail
carrier,
means
rail
transportation.
and
if
it
means
that
up
in
a,
then
it
must
in
f.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
says,
as
a
part
of
a
continuous
intermodal
movement.
so
it's
the
rail
portion
of
a
continuous
intermodal
movement.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
sure
do.
what
else
do
you
have?
