mr.
fernando
rodriguez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
well
over
50
years
the
railroad
commission
of
texas
has
regulated
intrastate
motor
carriage,
within
the
state
of
texas.
that
regulation
has
been
active.
that
regulation
has
been
vigorous.
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
at
the
same
time,
that
regulation
has
been
even-handed,
and
has
been
entirely
in
keeping
with
the
legislative
mandate
under
which
the
railroad
commission
operates.
that
legislative
mandate
was
given
to
the
commission
by
the
texas
legislature.
in
early
1984,
the
icc,
acting
pursuant
to
what
it
considered
to
be
its
jurisdiction
and
authority,
exempted
from
regulation
the
motor
carrier
portion
of
a
totally
intrastate
tofc
shipment.
i
agree
with
mr.
roper
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
simply
this:
did
the
icc
have
the
jurisdiction
under
its
statutes,
under
the
sections
in
its
statutes,
to
exempt
the
motor
carrier
portion
of
a
purely
intrastate
tofc
shipment,
or,
as
the
state
of
texas
contends,
is
there
a
countervailing
force
to
that?
the
state
of
texas
contends...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
was
the
question
you
were
asking
just
a
moment
ago...
that
section
10521b
is
an
express
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
icc
to
regulate
intrastate
motor
carriage.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
your
honor--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--justice
stevens,
we're
still
talking
about
a
purely
intrastate
movement?
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
yes,
your
honor,
we
contend
that
under
10521b,
which
is
the
express
reservation
of
power
to
the
states,
the
icc...
the
icc
simply
has
no
jurisdiction--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
in
short,
this
is
clearly
a
case
that
involves
preemption
or
not
preemption.
and
that
being
the
case,
we
have
to
apply
the
principles
of
preemption.
now
we
recognize...
the
state
of
texas
recognizes...
that
congress'
authority
to
regulate
interstate
between
the
intrastate
commerce
which
they
seek
to
regulate
and
interstate
commerce,
as
long
as
they
choose
a
reasonable
method,
which
comports
with
constitutional
limitations,
they
can
regulate
those
intrastate
commerce
type
of
movements.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
that's
what
it
all
boils
down
to,
justice
scalia.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
well,
your
honor,
is
a
truck
not
a
struck
simply
because
it
has
burlington
norther
or
mkt
on
the
side,
when
that
truck
provides
the
same
type
of
service
which
john
doe
freight
lines
provides?
our
contention
is
that
you
do
not...
you
consider
what
section
of
the
statute
you
come
under
by
looking
at
the
type
of
transportation
provided.
you
do
not
look
at
who
owns
the
particular
type
of
vehicle.
if
it
is
motor
vehicle
transportation
as
defined
by
the
statute
in
10102--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--no.
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
the
icc
does
have
jurisdiction
over
interstate
motor
carriage.
essentially--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
an
interstate
movement.
i
think
that
would
be
an
interstate
movement.
a
purely
intrastate
movement
would
be
something
like
a
movement
by
truck
from
brownsville,
texas
to
houston,
at
which
point
it
is
placed
on
a
flatcar.
the
flatcar
goes
to
dallas,
at
which
point
the
trailer
comes
off
the
flatcar,
is
attached
to
a
truck,
and
is
carried
to,
say,
wichita
falls.
it's
a
purely
intrastate
movement.
that's
the
type
of
movement
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
if
there's
a
leg
of
that
transportation
that
crosses
state
lines,
then
we're
talking
about
an
interstate
movement,
and
that's
not
involved
here.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
justice
o'connor,
that's...
you've
essentially
grasped
what
this
case
is
all
about.
that
is
what
it
comes
down
to.
the
icc
contends
that
under
the
definition,
that
the
definition
is
so
broad
that
it
includes
this
type
of
traffic.
we
contend
that
it
does
not
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one,
there
is
a
specific
statutory
expression
of
power
reserved
to
the
states
in
10521b,
which
says
specifically,
that
nothing
in
this
statute
is
meant
to
take
away
intrastate
motor
carriage
regulation
from
the
states;
that's
a
paraphrase.
but
more
importantly,
transportation
as
defined
in
section
10102...
i
think
it's
section
25...
does
not
mean
what
they
say
it
means
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one,
it's
a
recodification
of
the
prior
statutes
in
which
the
definition
of
transportation
was
different
for
motor
carrier,
water
carrier,
and
freight
forwarding.
number
two,
it's
in
the
disjunction;
it
is
not
in
the
conjunctive.
it
talks
about
x,
y,
z,
or
a
different
type
of
transportation.
finally,
your
honor,
transportation
is
defined
broadly
because
it
is
used
in
the
statute
in
many
different
contexts.
clearly
to
me,
and
to
the
state
of
texas,
it
has...
while
it's
defined
broadly,
it
means
different
things
in
different
contexts.
and
that's
why
it's
much
too
simplistic
to
say
that
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier
includes
any
other
type
of
ancillary
transportation
such
as
motor
carrier
traffic,
which
a
railroad
might
seek
to
provide.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
your
honor,
i
would
agree
that
some
deference
is
due
the
icc.
but
once
again,
we
have
a
countervailing
force
because
we're
apply
preemption
analysis
to
this
type
of
case.
when
we
have...
when
we
deal
with
a
congressional
grant
of
authority
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
that
involves
the
state,
in
which
the
state
is
being
preempted
from
a
function
which
it
has
traditionally
done,
the
cases
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
clear
expression
of
intent
on
the
congress
to
do
that.
and
i
think
that
comes
about
because
the
states
are
essentially
different
creatures.
they
are
not
like
a
private
party.
that
is
why
we
have
a
tenth
amendment,
and
that's
why
we
have
an
eleventh
amendment.
they
stand
in
different
stead
than
a
private
party.
i
think
there
is
something
of
a
problem
in
that
when
we
talk
about
tenth
amendment
cases,
the
garcia
case
complicates
things
somewhat.
previously,
we
had
thought...
we
who
represent
the
states
had
thought
that
there
was
a
body
of
law
which
included--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--yes,
sir.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
well,
it's
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
your
honor.
but
to
do
that,
i
think
i
need
to
refer
to
the
type
of
preemption
analysis
that's
done
in
an
interstate
commerce
case.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
absolutely
not,
justice
stevens.
if
congress
said,
tomorrow,
we
want
intrastate
motor
carriage
either
exempted
from
regulation
or
given
to
the
icc,
we'd
have
no
case.
we
concede
that.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
just
about
that,
your
honor.
that's
the
key
phrase.
if
you
look
at
the
statutory...
or
the
legislative
history
of
the
staggers
act,
there
is
clearly
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
improve
the
financial
position
of
the
railroads.
we
do
not
contest
that.
there
is
an
intent
on
congress
to
avoid,
as
much
as
possible,
the
system
of
dual
regulation
which
applied
to
the
railroads.
but
the
staggers
act,
justice
marshall,
was
an
accommodation.
there
were
those
in
congress
at
the
time
that
simply
wanted
to
exclude
the
states
from
any
and
all
regulation.
and
senator
broyhill's
compromise,
which
is...
which
found
its
way
ultimately
into
the
statute,
was
that
there
will
be
different
levels
of
regulation.
they
did
do
away
with
much
of
the
red
tape.
but
the
states
can
still
regulate
intrastate
rail
carriage,
as
long
as
they
comply
with
the
standards
which
the
icc
sets.
even
if
they
comply
with
the
standards
which
the
icc
sets,
an
appellant
can
take
a
decision
from
a
state
regulatory
body
to
the
icc
on
the
grounds
that
it
contravenes
an
icc
policy.
but
furthermore,
there
is
still
that
specific
expression
of...
or
that
express
reservation
of
powers
to
the
states
in
10521b.
and
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
went
off
on
in
this
case,
and
that
is
what
we
contend
prevents
the
icc
from
exerting
regulatory
control--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--no,
your
honor,
they
haven't.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
to
a
certain
extent,
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
there
is
a
measure
of
deference
which
is
owed
the
icc.
but
that
measure
of
deference
disappears
when
you
have
an
express
statutory
reservation
of
power,
as
you
have
in
10521b.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
well,
that's
all
part
of
the
same
act.
your
honor.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
justice
stevens,
when
i
was
talking
about
the
garcia
case,
is
that
previously
we
had
thought
that
in
an
interstate
commerce
case,
when
you're
talking
about
interstate
commerce,
congress
can
legislate
against
the
states,
can
intrude
upon
what
normally
would
be
considered
state
sovereignty,
as
long
as
there
is
no
constitutional
impedient
to
that.
after
garcia,
where
we
are
now
told
that
there
are
no
traditional
notions
of
what
is
a
government
function,
that
in
fact
we
have
to
participate
in
the
political
process
to
safeguard
whatever
prerogatives
we
would
like
to
have,
we
are
left
essentially
between
a
xx
a
hard
place.
we
have
to
go...
we
have
to
depend
on
congress
not
overregulate.
and
yet
we
have
to
go
to
congress
to
preserve
our
own
prerogatives.
what
that
says
to
me...
and
we
also
are
still
acknowledging
the
facts
that
states
are
different;
that
they
constitute
or
they
hold
a
special
position
in
our
federal
system.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
that's
correct.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
well,
in
part
that's
true,
your
honor.
and
perhaps
the
states
were
lucky
in
that
this
particular
section,
10521b,
is
in
the
statute,
particularly
in
light
of
what
garcia
v.
san
antonio
metropolitan
transit
authority
says.
the
point
of
all
this,
your
honor,
is
that--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--no,
justice
stevens,
i
think
you're
talking
about
the
three
sections
which
are
specifically
referred
to
in--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--those
three
sections
refer
to
intrastate
motor
carriage
of
passengers.
those
talk
about
busses.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
they
do
not
talk
about
intrastate
motor
carriage
of
property.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
i
think
probably
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
that
leads
us
to,
then,
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
and
is
our
statutory
interpretation
better
than
the
icc's?
in
this
particular
case...
clearly;
i
mean
i'm
here
to
win
the
case...
i
submit
that
ours
is
the
best
interpretation.
and
i
think
ours
is
the
best
interpretation
because
it
goes
and
turns
on
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words.
to
my
way
of
thinking,
the
icc's
interpretation,
how
they
get
to
what
constitutes
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier,
is
tortured
and
arduous.
our
interpretation,
on
the
other
hand,
basically
is
very
clear.
it
says
a
truck
is
a
truck,
and
a
train
is
a
train.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
they
say
a
truck
is
a
railroad,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
some
point...
at
some
point
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
common
meaning
of
words.
if
you
look
at
section
10102,
i
think
there
are
four
definitions
which
basically
foreclose
this
issue.
i've
already
gone
over
section
25
which
defines
transportation.
the
next
one
i'd
like
to
discuss
is
section
10102,
sections
12
and
13,
which
talk
about
what
is
a
motor
common
carrier,
and
what
is
a
motor
contract
carrier.
and
essentially
both
of
those
are
persons
who
hold
themselves
out
to
the
public
to
provide
motor
vehicle
transportation
for
compensation
over
highways.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
your
honor--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--i
don't
know
if
it
would
make
the
government
uncomfortable.
but
i
think
what
you're
saying
follows
logically.
and
i
think
that's
the
incongruity.
it
simply
can't
mean
everything
for
everyone.
transportation
means--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--well,
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
well,
that's
clearly
the
position
that
the
icc
is
taking
in
this
case.
put
your
honor,
we
contend
that...
that
that
simply
does
not
jibe
with
what
the
prior
legislative...
or
prior
legislative
enactments.
you
had
three
separate
definitions
of
transportation,
all
of
which
were
codified
and
combined
in
the
section.
now,
we're
talking
about
the
whole
statute.
and
through
the
statute,
the
term
"transportation"
is
discussed.
now,
clearly
it
can't
mean
everything
for
everybody.
in
the
context
of
transportation
provided
by
a
motor
carrier,
does
it
also
talk
about...
does
it
also
include
the
term,
vessel?
are
we
talking
about
barges?
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
does
not.
and
at
some
point
you
have
to
impose
some
level
of
logic
and
clarity
on
this.
another
reason
which
i
believe
augurs
in
our
favor
and
against
the
government
is
that
if,
in
fact...
if,
in
fact,
transportation
provided
by
a
motor
carrier...
excuse
me,
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier
includes
transportation
which
otherwise
would
be
motor
carrier
traffic,
then
i
submit
there
would
have
been
absolutely
no
reason
to
include
in
10505f
the
specific
reference
to
intermodal
movements.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
10505f,
your
honor.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
if
i
may,
your
honor,
10505f
says,
the
commission
may
exercise
its
authority
under
this
section
to
exempt
transportation
that
is
provided
by
a
rail
carrier
as
a
part
of
a
continuous
intermodal
movement.
if
in
fact
the
icc
is
correct,
and
the
phrase,
transportation
provided
by
a
rail
carrier
includes
motor
carrier
traffic,
there
would
have
been
absolutely
no
sense
in
including
that
section.
that
section
specifically
recognizes
intermodal
traffic.
and
it
was
put
there
for
a
purpose.
and
yet,
even
though
it
was
put
there
for
a
purpose,
we
still
have
section
10521b
staring
us
in
the
face,
which
is
the
express
reservations
of
power
to
the
states
to
regulate
intrastate
motor
carriage.
what
that
says
to
me
is
that
the
congress
intended
the
icc
have
the
power
to
regulate,
or
to
exempt
from
regulation,
on
an
interstate
basis,
motor
carrier
traffic
that's
part
of
tofc
service.
the
express
reservation
of
power--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--intermodal.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
that's
what
intermodal
movements
are.
it's
combined
movements.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
only
as
modified
by
the
term,
intermodal
movement,
your
honor.
there
is
no
reference
to
intermodal
movement
in
10505a.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
inclusion
of
the
word,
intermodal
movement,
is
an
express...
it's
an
expression
by
congress
that
there
is
a
type
of
movement
which
will
be
allowed.
that
type
of
movement
is
an
intermodal
movement
involving
tofc,
involving
trains,
involving
trucks--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--your
honor,
it
would,
except
for
the
fact
that
f
contains
the
phrase,
intermodal
movement.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
read
it
differently
from
the
way
you
read
it.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
your
honor,
the
problem
is,
i
think,
the
states
are
being
whipsawed.
in
garcia,
you've
got
the
states
having
to
rely
on
the
political
process
to
preserve
their
own
initiatives.
and
yet
we
have
to
go
to
congress
and
depend
on
congress
not
to
overregulate
in
areas
which
are
traditionally
left
to
the
states,
such
as
this.
nonetheless,
we
still
have
a
recognition
that
the
states,
as
states,
hold
a
special
place
in
the
federal
system.
i
believe
there
is
a
necessary
corollary
to
that.
and
the
corollary
is,
if
a
statute
is
at
all
confusing,
if
a
statute
is
at
all
ambiguous,
then
that
ambiguity
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
states.
that's
the
only
conclusion
which
i
can
draw
from
the
interstate
commerce
cases
and
the
garcia
case--
and
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
the
icc
uses
such
a
tortured
interpretation
to
get
to
where
it's
going,
is
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
make
the
statute
clear.
in
that
case,
the
dispute,
the
ambiguity
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
states.
if
it's
not,
it
is
for
congress
to
clarify.
and
congress
can
clarify
very
easily
by
simply
referencing
in
10521b,
one
other
section,
perhaps
11501,
where
they
could
say
that
there's
a
specific...
there's
a
specific
power
to
exempt
intrastate
motor
carriage
when
part
of
a
tofc
movement.
they
have
not
done
that.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
for
the
icc
to
put
that
there
when
they
are
faced
with
the
specific
reservation
of
power
in
10521b.
if
i
might
just
respond
to
a
couple
of
points
that
mr.
roper
made,
as
i
stated
when
i
started,
the
railroad
commission
of
texas
has
regulated
motor
carrier
traffic
in
texas
intensively.
and
unless
this
court
tells
us
that
we
cannot
do
so,
they
intend
to
continue
to
do
that.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
they
intend
to
provide
an
unfair
competitive
advantages...
advantage
to
motor
carriers.
part
of
their
legislative
mandate,
under
article
911b,
which
is
the
texas
statute
which
controls
their
jurisdiction,
is
the
fostering
of
a
motor
carrier...
the
motor
carrier
industry
as
a
viable
alternative
for
shippers.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
they
want
to
impose
an
unfair
competitive
advantage
on
railroads
providing
tofc
service
intrastate.
there
is
no
unfair
disadvantage
imposed
on
the--
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
there
is
economic
regulation
involved
in
this,
your
honor.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
they
as
motor
carriers
would
not
pay
anything
less,
or
anything
more,
than
other
similarly
situated
motor
carriers
providing
that
type
of
service
in
the
state.
that
is
not
an
unfair
competitive
advantage.
that
is
an
attempt
to
create
equal
markets
for
everybody
competing
in
the
same
type
of
service.
there
is
no
infirmity
in
that.
there
is
no
constitutional
infirmity.
there
is
nothing
which
transgresses
the
policies
of
the
staggers
act
or
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
your
honor,
if
it's
an
interstate
movement,
while
we
might...
while
the
state
of
texas
or
the
railroad
commission
might
like
to
do
something,
they
simply
do
not
have
the
ability
to
do
so.
because
if
it's
an
interstate
movement,
it
is
without
the
regulation
of
the
railroad
commission
of
texas.
mr.
fernando
rodriguez
that's
what
the
act
says,
your
honor.
in
closing,
we
would
simply,
respectfully
pray
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
or
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case.
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
was
ably
reasoned,
and
it
distinguished
the
prior
ata
case;
and
it
recognizes
the
specific
reservation
of
power
under
10521b,
which
is
the
exact
same
type...
the
exact
same
type
of
reservation
of
power
which
this
court
affirmed
in
the
louisiana
public
service
case,
which
involved
the
fcc.
in
that
case,
we
had
section
152b,
which
said
that
the
federal
communications
commission
had
no
authority
over
intrastate
rates,
charges
or
practices.
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
specific
reservation
of
power
for
the
states
to
regulate
intrastate
depreciation
rates.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
here.
and
based
on
that
reasoning,
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
