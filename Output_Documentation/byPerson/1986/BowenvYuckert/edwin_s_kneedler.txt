mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
severity
regulation
that
was
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
under
the
disability
programs
established
by
titles
2
and
16
of
the
social
security
act.
the
current
version
of
the
severity
regulation
is
an
integral
part
of
the
five-step
sequential
evaluation
process
that
the
secretary
established
by
regulation
in
1978
to
promote
the
fair,
uniform,
and
efficient
evaluation
of
the
more
than
two
million
claims
that
are
filed
annually
under
the
program.
within
the
framework
of
this
sequential
evaluation
process
the
severity
regulation
serves
two
distinct
but
largely
overlapping
purposes.
first,
it
assures
that
benefits
are
paid
only
to
persons
for
whom
a
significant
medical
impairment
as
distinguished
from
an
adverse
vocational
profile
consisting
of
age,
education,
and
work
experience
is
the
primary
or
substantial
cause
of
his
inability
to
work.
it
is
this
requirement
that
distinguishes
the
disability
program
from
other
forms
of
unemployment
compensation.
the
second
principle
or
purpose
served
by
the
severity
regulation
is
that
it
screens
out
at
an
early
stage
of
the
sequential
evaluation
process
those
claimants
who
it
may
reasonably
be
presumed
would
be
found
not
to
be
disabled
even
if
the
secretary
proceeded
throughout
that
process
and
conducted
a
fullblown
vocational
assessment.
four
terms
ago,
in
heckler
versus
campbell,
this
court
unanimously
sustained
the
medical
vocational
guidelines
that
are
applied
at
step
5
of
the
sequential
evaluation
process.
the
court
recognized
the
compelling
need
for
efficiency
and
uniformity
of
adjudication
in
the
massive
disability
programs
sustaining
those
regulations.
those
same
considerations
underlie
the
severity
regulation
as
well.
in
this
case,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
severity
regulation
conflicts
with
the
social
security
act
and
is
invalid
on
its
face.
it
is
the
government's
position
before
this
court
that
that
holding
is
clearly
wrong.
the
principle
on
which
the
severity
regulation
is
based
which
is
that
benefits
may
be
denied
in
appropriate
cases
on
the
basis
of
medical
evidence
alone
that
shows
an
impairment
is
relatively
minor,
that
principle
has
been
a
feature
of
the
disability
programs
since
they
were
started
in
1954,
and
since
that
time,
and
particularly
most
recently
since
1978
literally
millions
of
claims
have
been
screened
against
that
test.
the
current
version
of
the
regulation,
as
we
show
in
our
briefs,
is
supported
by
the
text
and
legislative
history
of
the
1954
and
'67
amendments
to
the
act,
but
beyond
that
it
is
our
submission
that
congress
in
the
text
and
legislative
history
of
the
disability
amendments
of
1984
ratified
the
amendment.
now,
before
discussing
those
arguments
in
any
detail
i
will
briefly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i
am
sorry,
ratified
the
regulation.
i
will
briefly
outline
the
statutory
scheme
and
the
sequential
evaluation
process
to
explain
where
the
severity
regulation
fits
in.
the
basic
definition
of
disability
for
the
programs
was
enacted
in
1954.
it
provides
that
the
term
disability
shall
mean
the
inability
to
engage
in
any
substantial
gainful
activity
by
reason
of
a
medically
determinable
physical
or
mental
impairment,
and
then
with
a
certain
durational
requirement.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
the
house
and
senate
reports
on
the
1954
legislation
explain
two
aspects
of
disability
determination
under
that
standard.
the
first
aspect
is
that
there
must
be
an
impairment
of
serious
proportions.
and
then
the
second,
picking
up
on
the
by
reason
of
language
says
that
the
person
must
be
unable
to
work
by
reason
of
such
an
impairment,
in
other
words,
one
that
is
already--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
in
1967
congress
enacted
section
423(d)(2)(a)
to
further
restrict
eligibility
in
light
of
some
judicial
decisions,
and
under
that
provision
the
requirement
is
that
the
claimant
be
unable
to
engage
in
any
substantial
gainful
activity
that
exists
anywhere
in
the
national
economy
irrespective
of
whether
those
jobs
are
in
his
own
vicinity
or
whether
he
would
be
hired
for
them.
the
sequential
evaluation
process
established
by
regulation
in
1978
implements
these
statutory
standards.
it
doesn't
incorporate
new
concepts.
these
are
all
concepts
in
the
adjudication
process
that
had
been
in
existence
long
before
1978.
the
first
step
in
the
process
is
really
irrelevant
here.
it
is
that
if
a
person
is
already
engaging
in
substantial
gainful
activity,
obviously
he
is
not
disabled
because
he
can
work.
steps
2
and
3
then
establish
what
are
really
two
outer
limits
or
two
points
on
a
spectrum
in
which
the
least
serious
and
the
most
serious
impairments
can
be
identified
on
medical
grounds
alone.
at
step
2
that
addresses
the
least
serious
impairments
and
under
that
test
the
claimant
must
satisfy
a
certain
minimum
threshold
of
impairment
severity
to
justify
the
secretary's
considering
it
as
probably
being
the
primary
cause
of
his
inability
to
work.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
did
not
survive
step
2.
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
interpretive
ruling
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that
guideline
as
the
secretary
made
clear
in
promulgating
it,
does
not
state
a
new
policy.
it
reflects
what
the
proper
standard
of
adjudication
should
have
been
and
was
under
the
program
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
here,
not
to
focus
on
respondent's
allegations
and
testimony
but
the
alj
specifically
found
that
she
was
exaggerating
those
claims.
he
found
no
objective
clinical
evidence
to
suggest
the
severity
of
those
symptoms
to
that
extent,
so
that
i
think
that
there
is...
it
would
certainly
be
our
position
that
even
in
light
of
the
ruling,
which
we
think
didn't
change
things,
that
her
case
would
have
come
out
the
same.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
not,
because
applying...
first
of
all,
we
would
have
a
concern
there
about
courts
sending
cases
back
in
light
of
the
new
ruling
because
it
suggests
the
potential
for
reopening
a
lot
of
past
claims,
even
those
that
are
not
currently
surviving,
and
in
our
view
because
the
ruling
did
not
change
the
substantive
standard
of
disability,
there
is
no
occasion
to
send
it
back.
now,
if--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--invalid
on
its...
and
not
the
ruling,
not
the
interpretive
ruling.
the
regulation
was
invalid
on
its
face.
now,
we
do
suggest
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right,
invalid
on
its
face.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
the
only
issue
in
this
case.
we
do--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
certiorari
petition
at
pages...
beginning
on
page
37a.
on
page
41a
the
secretary
explains
that
the
standard
is
that
a
claim
will
be
not
severe
if
it
would
have
no
more
than
a
minimal
effect
on
an
individual's
ability
to
work
even
if
his
age,
education,
and
work
experience
were
specifically
considered,
that
is,
that
the
person's
impairment
would
have
no
more
than
a
minimal
effect
on
his
physical
or
mental
abilities
to
perform
basic
work
activities.
if
we
look
at
the
preamble
to
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
in
1978,
that
is
exactly
the
description
of
the
severity
regulation
itself,
not
the
ruling
but
the
regulation
itself
that
the
secretary
gave,
so
this
does
not
establish
new
ground.
it
clarifies
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--quite
close
to
it.
it
is
on
the
portion
of
the
preamble
to
the
1987...
yes,
it
is
on
page
9296
of
the
federal
register
from
1978.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
terms
of
what
the
department's
official
position
and
what
the
regulation
meant,
now,
if
there
were
individual
applications
of
the
regulation
during
the
interval
in
which
aljs
had
misapplied
it,
that
is
a
different
question,
but
we
are
talking
about
what
the
substantive
legal--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
the
preamble
in
1978
the
secretary
explained
it,
that
there
is
a
point
in
the
range
of
impairment
severity
below
which
the
effects
of
the
impairment
have
such
a
minimal
effect
on
the
individual
that
they
would
not
be
expected
to
interfere
with
his
or
her
ability
to
work
irrespective
of
his
age,
education,
or
work
experience.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
would
not
be
expected
to.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
that
is
our
position,
and
that
is
spelled
out
in
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
now,
the
most
recent
ruling
does
identify
an
accommodation
of
the
past
work
principle.
first,
let
me
state
the
general
rule.
the
premise
is
that
the
definition
of
a
nonsevere
impairment
is
one
that
does
not
significantly
limit
the
ability
to
do
basic
work
activities
that
are
necessary
for
most
jobs,
so
the
assumption
is,
if
the
claimant
has
an
impairment
that
falls
into
that
category
she
is
able
to
do
most
jobs,
and
therefore
would
be
able
to
do
her
own
past
work.
the
new
ruling
says
that
if
the
claimant
is
unable
to
do
his
or
her
past
work
by
virtue
of
unique
features
of
that
work,
then
it
is
not
something...
it
is
not
something
that
is
addressed
by
the
most
jobs
limitation.
it
is
one
of
those
few
jobs
that
is
unique,
that
has
unique
job
requirements,
and
the
new
ruling
allows
the
sequential
evaluation
process
to
progress
beyond
that
point.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
only
under
the
new
ruling--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
not
related,
and
this
is
spelled
out
in
the
sequential
evaluation
process,
and
i
would
point
out
that
that
was
well
known
to
congress
at
the
time
that
congress
ratified--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
uniqueness
of
the
job
does
if
it
has
unique
job
requirements.
the
example
that
is
sometimes
mentioned
is
the
pilot
who
must
have
20-20
vision.
if
he
has
20-30
vision
it
is
a
unique
requirement
of
his
job.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
yes,
because
the
premise
of
the
regulation
is
that
the
claimant
has
the
ability
to
do
basic
work
functions
necessary
for
most
jobs
to
stand,
to...
or
that
that
is
not
significantly
affected.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
then
she
would.
if
there
is
any
one...
if
there
is
any
one
of
the
job
requirements
or
the
basic
work
functions
that's
necessary
for
most
jobs
that
she
can't
do
she
would
pass
beyond
step
2.
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
she
was
denied
on
initial
application
and
reconsideration
on
the
basis
of
inability
to
do
her
past
work,
and
the
alj
also
noted
in
stating
that
she
could
do
basic
work
activities,
he
said
specifically
real
estate--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
alj
did
not
rest
it
at
step
4
of
the
sequential
evaluation
process,
but
when
he
said
she
is
able
to
do
basic
work
activities
he
said,
for
example,
real
estate
salesperson,
so
i
think
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
how
the
regulation
does
not
unfairly
weed
out
people
who
would
be
weeded
out
later
on.
the
materials
that
we
cite
in
footnote
11
of
our
reply
brief
show
extensive
congressional
awareness
of
how
this
regulation
works,
including
the
explanation
that
as
more
people
were
screened
out
on
the
nonsevere
step,
fewer
were
screened
out
on
the
basis
that
they
could
do
their
past
work.
there
is
a
very
close
correlation
between
the
two.
if
you
are
able
to
do
all
basic
work
activities
you
will
be
able
to
do
your
past
work,
assuming
that
it
is
not
unique.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
could
be,
although
the
new...
i
think
the
statute
would
certainly
permit
that,
and
that
was
the
adjudication
approach
prior
to
the
new
ruling
in
1985.
the
new
ruling
provides
special
protection
for
a
claimant
in
that
situation
and
says
that
the
secretary
will
go
on
to
consider
his
age,
education,
and
work
experience.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
in
every
case
he
will
be
found
not
disabled
at
that
stage,
too,
because
he
would
not
have
an
impairment
that
has
significantly
affected
his
ability
to
do
all
the
other
jobs
in
the
national
economy.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
does
not
mean
that,
and
in
fact
its
usefulness
as
an
adjudicatory
tool
would
not
be
solved.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
does
not
look
at
the
individual's
condition.
it
looks
at
the
nature
of
the
impairment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
does
not
look
at
what
the
individual--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
know
about
average
but
it
is
speaking
in
terms
of
a
category.
and
this,
i
think
this
principle
is
confirmed
by
both
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
not
necessary
to
focus--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
not
necessary
to
focus
on
the
individual.
otherwise,
it
would...
there
is
a
regulatory
standard
of
nonsevere,
and
the
adjudicator
has
to
decide
how
much
of
a
difference
an
impairment
would
make.
is
it
the
sort
of
thing
a
stubbed
toe,
20-30
vision
that
would
affect--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
definitely
does
not
mean
that.
the
ruling
does
not
change
that
aspect
of
the
regulation
at
all.
the
severity
regulation
in
1520(c)
specifically
says
we
do
not
consider
your
age,
education,
and
work
experience.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well
it
is
that.
it
is
also
guidance
to
the
decisionmaker.
i
mean,
there
is
a
certain
element
of
a
subjectivity
here,
but
an
alj
assessing
someone's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is,
and
that
has
not
changed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
is
an
ongoing
study
of
the
severity
concept
within
the
department
as
there
are
references
in
the
briefs
here
to
continuing
studies,
possible
reformulations
of
the
standard.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this
is
not
a
new
regulation.
again,
we
are
focusing
only
on
the
validity
of
the
regulation
on
its
face,
and
in
that
connection
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
text
and
legislative
history
of
the
1984
disability
amendments,
which
congress
thoroughly
studied
the
entire
disability
program,
changed
the
things
it
thought
needed
changing,
and
left
unchanged
the
things
that
it
did
not.
congress
in
this
context
acted
against
the
background
of
the
severity
regulation
that
specifically
said
your
age,
education,
and
work
experience
will
not
be
considered
and
against
the
background
of
the
regulations
that
said
if
you
are
weeded
out
at
any
step
the
process
will
not
proceed,
which
includes
the
consequence
that
if
you
are
weeded
out
at
the
severity
step
you
don't
get
to
the
point
of
considering
the
person's
ability
to
do
past
work.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
all
of
that
is
true.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
all
of
that
is
still
true.
that
was
clear
on
the
face
of
the
regulations
against
which
congress
acted.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
five
courts
have
sustained
the
regulation.
they
have
sustained
it
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
accomplish
a
change
from
what
the
secretary...
the
standard
the
secretary
was
applying
prior
to
1978.
that
has
always
been
the
secretary's
position.
that
is
explained
in
the
preamble
to
the
severity...
to
the
vocational
regulations
in
1978,
so
that
is
not...
that
is
not
really
an
issue
here,
but
whether
or
not
there
is
a
change
is
really
irrelevant
at
this
point,
because
whatever
the
prior
law
might
have
been,
congress
ratified
the
current
severity
regulations
when
it
enacted
the
1984
act.
and
this
is
clear
from
looking
at
the
text
of
the
provision
that
was
added
in
1984,
which
is
on
page
27
of
our
brief.
the
first
sentence
of
that
says...
first
of
all,
the
purpose
of
the
1984
amendments
was
to
require
the
secretary
to
consider
the
combined
effect
of
multiple
impairments,
but
congress
otherwise
left
the
sequential
evaluation
process
untouched,
and
that
appears...
the
significance
of
that
appears
in
the
very
language
congress
used
in
the
act.
it
says,
"in
determining
whether
an
individual's
physical
or
mental
impairments
are
of
sufficient
medical
severity
that
they
could
be
the
basis
of
a
finding
of
eligibility,
the
secretary
will
consider
the
combined
effect."
well,
that
first
sentence
clearly
says
medical
severity,
and
it
states
it
in
terms
of
whether
it
could
be
a
basis
of
eligibility,
which
is
language
of
a
threshold
test.
then
the
second
sentence
says,
if
the
secretary
does
find
a
medically
severe
combination
of
impairments,
he
will
consider
that
combination
throughout
the
disability
determination
process,
in
other
words,
throughout
the
subsequent
steps
of
the
sequential
evaluation
process.
the
obvious
intent
of
this
is
that
those
subsequent
steps
will
be
reached
only
if,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
secretary
first
does
find
a
medically
severe
impairment,
so
the
endorsement
of
the
secretary's
approach
in
the
regulations,
which
were
clear
on
their
face,
is
right
in
the
language
of
the
act,
but
if
there
could
be
any
doubt
about
that
it
is
dispelled
by
a
reference
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
first,
we...
as
this
court
recognized
in
heckler
versus
day
several
terms
ago,
congress
was
very
aware
of
the
way
the
disability
program
was
being
run
in
the
late
seventies
and
early
1980s.
we
have
listed
in
footnote
11
of
our
reply
brief
a
whole
series
of
congressional
references
to
the
way
the
severity
step
of
the
sequential
evaluation
process
worked.
that
shows
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
various
features
that
are
being
discussed
here
and
that
have
been
discussed
by
respondents,
including
the
fact
that
the
number
of
denials
on
the
basis
of
nonsevere
impairment
went
from
8
percent
in
1975
to
40
percent
in
1981.
congress
knew
all
of
that,
so
congress
ratified
this
regulation
against
the
background
of
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
way
in
which
it
operated.
several
of
those
as
well
as
the
committee
prints
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
aarp,
there
is
a
house
committee
print
that
specifically
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
prior
work
does
not
occur
until
step
5.
congress
understood
how
it
worked,
but
the
committee
reports
on
the
1984
legislation
make
that
even
clearer.
the
senate
brief,
for
example,
stresses
that
this
new
rule
of
considering
combined
impairments
is
to
be
applied
in
strict
conformity
with
the
current
sequential
evaluation
process.
the
house
report
discusses
the
sequential
evaluation
process
and
says
that
the
ability
to
do
past
work
and
other
work
will
be
considered
only
after
a
finding
of
severity.
the
conference
report
paraphrases
the
existing
regulation
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
a
significant
effect
on
the
ability
to
do
basic
work
activities,
and
it
says
we
do
not
intend
to
impair
the
use
of
that
sequential
evaluation
process.
finally,
senator
long,
who
had
an
extended
history
in
the
development
of
the
disability
program,
explained
what
congress
had
done
in
the
conference
report.
he
said
that
some
courts
had
ruled
the
secretary
can't
rule
out
claimants
on
the
basis
of
medical
grounds
alone,
and
there
were
district
court
decisions
like
that
at
that
time,
dixon
and
others.
but
senator
long
said
the
senate
bill
after
which
the
conference
bill
was
patterned
was
drafted
in
a
way
to
make
sure
the
secretary
can
do
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
used
to
be
a
list
in
rulings,
ssr
8255.
that
was
rescinded
at
the
time
that
8528
was
adopted.
but
the
standard,
the
notion
that
there
should
be
a
uniform
standard
is
still
in
place,
but
the
specific
listing
of
impairments
was
rescinded
but
that
was
well
within
the
secretary's
authority
just
as
he
can
promulgate--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
congress
was
aware
of
how
many
people
were
being
weeded
out.
again,
the
statistics
in
every
hearing,
every
committee
report
reveal
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--would
have
lost
anyway,
and
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
report
in
1978
explains
that
those
people
would
have
been
weeded
out...
past
work
for
the
most
part.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
they
isolate
on
what
happened
at
the
alj
stage.
in
the
smith
class
action
in
district
court
in
california,
for
example,
at
the
initial
and
reconsideration
stages
there
was
a
difference
in
only
6
percent
of
the
cases.
it
is
also
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
if
the
decisionmaker
reflexively
applies
the
vocational
guidelines
then
you
might
find
people
disabled
because
the
vocational
guidelines
are
expressly
premised
on
the
existence
of
a
severe
impairment.
it
says
so
in
the
charts
that
describe
the
matrix
of
various
factors.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
someone
is
found
disabled
at
step
5
of
the
sequential
evaluation
process
by
considering
his
age,
education,
and
work
experience,
the
regulations
are
drafted
in
a
way
that
you
are
only
supposed
to
get
there
if
the
claimant
has
first
been
found
to
have
a
severe
impairment.
if
the
decisionmaker
applies
those
regulations
without
having
made
that
threshold
determination,
you
will
get
improper
decisions
at
step
5
because
they
are
not
predicated
on
the
existence
of
a
severe
impairment.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
several
points
i
would
like
to
make.
with
respect
to
the
conference
report
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
page
47
of
our
brief
we
set
out
the
pertinent
paragraph
of
the
conference
report.
respondent
does
not
quote
the
relevant
sentence
of
ratification
here.
the
sentence
she
quotes
says
that
"a
judgment
that
a
person
is
not
under
a
disability
may
be
based
on
a
determination
that
the
impairment
is
slight
enough
to
warrant
a
presumption."
--note
it
is
presumption,
not
individualized
determination...
"presumption
that
the
impairment
is
not...
that
the
person's
ability
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity
is
not
seriously
affected."
the
next
sentence
says,
"the
current
sequential
evaluation
process
allows
such
a
determination,
and
the
conferees
do
not
intend
to
either
eliminate
or
impair
the
use
of
that
process."
"as
i
have
explained,
it
is
entirely
clear
on
the
face
of
the
regulations
establishing
the
process
that
the
inability
to
do
past
work
does
not
get
you
past
the
severity
step,
and
the
severity
step
says
that
age,
education,
and
work
experience
are
not
considered."
respondents
suggest
that
congress
must
have
had
something
other
than
the
severity
standard
in
the
regulations
in
mind
when
it
ratified
the
regulations.
it
did
not.
the
previous
page
of
the
conference
report
quotes
the
social
security
rulings
that
say
in
order
to
be
nonsevere
an
impairment
must
not
significantly
affect
the
ability
to
basic
work
activities.
respondent
quarrels
with
the
concepts
that
are
in
the
regulation
that
congress
quoted
in
the
reports
and
that
congress
ratified.
congress
in
the
conference
report
quotes
two
social
security
rulings
that
explain
precisely
how
it
operates,
including
with
respect
to
past
work.
those
are
reproduced
in
respondent's
brief
and
referred
to
on
page
29
of
the
conference
report.
congress
knew
what
it
was
ratifying.
i
wanted
to
clarify
one
point
from
what
justice
scalia
was
saying.
the
severity
threshold
comes
not
simply
from
the
word
"impairment"
but
by
reason
of
impairment
in
the
basic
definition,
which--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
