unknown
speaker
ratified
the
regulations?
unknown
speaker
that
necessarily
refers
to
some
medical
basis?
unknown
speaker
whatever
impairment
it
is
has
to
be
because
of
some
medically
determinable--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
kneedler,
was
the
respondent's
claim
rejected
at
step
2?
it
didn't
survive
step
2?
unknown
speaker
and
was
the
respondent's
claim
evaluated
under
the
secretary's
guidelines,
8528,
which
talk
now
in
terms
of
some
minimal
impairment?
unknown
speaker
so
presumably
this
respondent's
claim
was
not
evaluated
at
step
2
with
that
guideline
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
might
have
been
helpful
to
the
administrator
considering
the
claim
to
have
had
that
in
mind,
at
least
if
you
read
about
this
particular
respondent's
problems,
it
would
appear
anyway
that
they
might
well
have
survived
step
2
under
that
guideline.
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
it
perhaps
be
appropriate
even
if
you
are
correct
to
remand
ms.
yuckert's
claim
at
least,
leave
it
open
in
light
of
the
new
guidelines?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
judgment
was
that
this
rule
was
just
invalid.
unknown
speaker
but
for
any
purpose,
it
is
just
invalid
on
its
face.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
issue,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
interpretive
ruling
in
your
brief?
i
am
having
trouble
finding
it.
do
you
have
it?
unknown
speaker
that
same
language
is
in
the
preamble?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
language
go?
frankly,
the
fact
that
the
secretary
said
in
issuing
this
interpretive
ruling
that
he
was
making
no
change
does
not
mean
that
he
was
making
no
change.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
not
something
he
can
make
happen
by
just
saying
it
has
happened.
unknown
speaker
no,
if
in
fact
he
meant
something
earlier
and
he
now
says,
no,
what
i
meant
all
along
was
something
different,
he
can't
change
what
the
past
was.
unknown
speaker
would
not
be
expected
to?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
the
hard
thing
about
this
case
is
really
understanding
what
the
threshold
is.
is
it
your
view
that
there
could
be
a
medical
impairment,
the
dizziness
and
so
forth,
all
the
stuff
that
this
particular
claimant
asserted
that
could
prevent
her
from
doing
the
job
she
used
to
do
in
the
past
but
nevertheless
could
be
as
a
matter
of
law
nonsevere
within
the
meaning
of
the
severity--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
it
is
clear
that
it
impairs
her
from
doing
a
particular
job,
but
that
is
not
necessarily--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let
me
just
interrupt
you
if
i
may.
we
have
a
case
here,
she
was
a
travel
agent,
i
think,
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
surely
that
is
not
a
unique
job.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
there
were
a
medical
impairment
severe
enough
to
prevent
her
from
doing
that
work,
could
that
end
the
inquiry?
i
mean,
it
is
severe
enough
to
prevent
her
from
doing
that
work,
but
then
they
think,
well,
it
may...
would
that
automatically
require
her
to
pass
step
2,
enable
her
to
pass
step
2?
unknown
speaker
but
then
it
isn't
related
to
the
uniqueness
of
the
job.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe...
you
go
too
fast
for
me.
i
am
puzzled,
then.
does
the
uniqueness
of
the
job
have
any
impact
on
the
analysis?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
the
regulation
can
still
be
dispositive
in
a
nonunique
job
such
as
this.
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
it
that
would
be
necessary
for
most
jobs
that
would
not
be
necessary
for
a
travel
agent?
standing,
i
mean,
those
things,
if
she
is
disqualified
from
doing
those
things
in
that
job,
why
wouldn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
think...
see,
i
am
puzzled
as
to
this
case
whether
she
lost
because
of
the
severity
regulation
or
she
couldn't
have
even
passed
the
old
standard
that
she
didn't
prove
she
was
disabled
from
doing
her
old
job.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
she
was
denied
on
the
basis
of
ability
to
do
her
last
work.
did
you
state
it
correctly,
or
did
i
misunderstand
it?
she
was
denied
on
the
basis
that
she
was
even
able
to
do
her
past
work,
wasn't
she?
unknown
speaker
if
a
pilot
should
have
20-20
but
has
20-30
if
he
applies
for
disability
he
could
be
weeded
out
at
step
2?
unknown
speaker
why
would
he?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
i
must
say
i
am
nothing
but
confused
by
the
clarifying
ruling.
when
you
compare
it
with
the
federal
register
prologue
it
really
doesn't
say
the
same
thing
if
that
federal
register
prologue
says,
as
you
quoted
it,
a
slight
abnormality
or
combination
of
slight
abnormalities
which
you
said
would
normally
be
expected
to
have
no
more
than
a
minimal
effect.
isn't
there
some
language
in
that
that
says,
would
normally
be
expected?
right?
but
in
the
new
clarification
it
says
a
slight
abnormality
or
combination
which
would
have
no
more
than
a
minimal
effect.
does
this
clarification
mean
that
you
really
have
to
inquire
into
each--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
that
is
why
i
am
confused.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
when
it
says
an
individual's
ability
it
doesn't
mean
the
individual
before
the
alj.
unknown
speaker
it
means
the
average
individual's
ability.
unknown
speaker
well,
but,
mr.
kneedler,
in
this
new
guideline
on
page
41a
of
your
petition
it
says
that
dealing
with
step
2
an
impairment
is
found
not
severe
and
a
finding
of
not
disabled
is
made
at
this
step,
meaning
step
2,
when
medical
evidence
establishes
only
a
slight
abnormality
which
would
have
no
more
than
a
minimal
effect
on
an
individual's
ability
to
work
even
if
the
individual's
age,
education,
or
work
experience
were
specifically
considered,
and
we
are
not
talking
about
the
individual's--
unknown
speaker
--age,
education,
and
work
experience?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
what
i
read,
to
me
means
that
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
particular
claimant's
age
and
education
and
work
experience.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
curious?
it
is
not
a
clarification,
then.
if
it
is
what
you
have
just
described,
it
is
not
a
clarification.
it
is
an
argument.
what
the
secretary
is
saying
by
that
language
is
that
if,
as
i
have
been
doing
in
the
past,
i
have
been
allowing
to
pass
step
2
all
of
those
disabilities
which
are
so
severe
that
they
prevent
your
conducting
basic
work
activities,
standing
and
all
the
things
you
say,
if
i
am
behaving
in
that
fashion,
i
am
automatically,
then
read
this
part,
saying
that
the
medical
evidence
establishes
an
abnormality
or
a
combination
which
would
have
no
more
than
a
minimal
effect
on
an
individual's
ability.
it
is
not
a
new
standard.
it
is
not
an
elaboration
of
it.
it
is
just
an
argument
that
if
i
do
what
i
have
been
doing
all
along,
this
in
fact
will
be
the
effect,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
crux
is
still
basic
work
activity.
unknown
speaker
that
is
still
the
crux.
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
think...
i
must
say
it
seems
to
me
that
the
new
regulation,
i
don't
know
what
effect
it
has
on
the
alj,
but
the
only
effect
it
has
on
me
is
to
confuse
me.
we
need
a
further
clarification.
unknown
speaker
this
isn't
a
new
regulation
anyway.
unknown
speaker
and
all
of
that
is
still
true.
unknown
speaker
including
that
your
particular
age,
background,
and
experience
will
not
be
considered.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
is
it
true
that
12
different
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
that
goes
beyond
the
secretary's
statutory
authority?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
one
other
question?
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
three
kinds
of
impairments,
ones
that
are
nonsevere,
those
that
are
severe
enough
to
go
past
step
2,
and
then
you
have
an
exhibit
at
the
end
of
the
regulations
that
say
some
of
them
are
so
severe
that
you
win
right
away.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
list
identifying
nonsevere
impairments,
the
kind
of
per
se
nonsevere
comparable
to
these?
unknown
speaker
the
concept
is
easy
enough
to
understand,
but
the
question
really
is,
i
suppose
they
contend,
in
effect,
that
you
have
got
too
many
things
that
you
regard
as
nonsevere
that
really
ought
to
be
in
the
intermediate
stage.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
say
those
people
would
have
lost
at
a
subsequent
stage
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
some
of
the
statistics
cited
by
the
respondent
don't
bear
that
out,
that
is,
that
in
those
jurisdictions
that
did
strike
down
the
secretary's
regulation
the
grant
rates
went
up
something
like
35
percent.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
what
you
have
just
said.
say
it
again.
unknown
speaker
those
were
in
individual
cases?
unknown
speaker
but
have
other
courts
of
appeals
declared
the
regulation
invalid
on
its
face?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
any
court
of
appeals
then
held
the
regulation
invalid
on
its
face?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
yes?
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
invalid?
unknown
speaker
it
can't
be
applied
in
any
case?
unknown
speaker
xxx
does
that.
it
doesn't
define
what
is
an
impairment.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
peg
that
the
secretary
is
hanging
his
hat
on.
what
is
an
impairment?
is
taste
a
deficiency
for
example?
you
don't
taste
things
quite
the
way
other
people
do.
is
that
an
impairment?
unknown
speaker
an
impairment
that
can
be,
but
you
are
still
left
with
the
preliminary
question,
what
is
an
impairment?
is
it
a
blemish
on
your
face?
is
it
any
abnormality
whatever
is
an
impairment?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you
yourself
acknowledge
in
your
brief,
you
must
acknowledge
some
running
room.
you
say
that
there
can
be
a
de
minimis
exclusion,
can't
there?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
basis
for
that?
isn't
it
that
some
things
just
aren't
impairment?
what
is
the
textual
basis
for
any
kind
of
an
exclusion
at
step
2,
whatever?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
i--
unknown
speaker
--you
acknowledge--
unknown
speaker
--fine,
a
medical
basis
is
necessary.
i
can
medically
demonstrate
a
very,
very
minor
abnormality.
as
i
understood
your
brief,
you--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
unknown
speaker
why?
could
never
be
found
disabling
at
step
2.
you
would
allow
them
to
kick
them
out
at
step
2,
and
all
i
am
suggesting
is,
if
you
believe
that,
the
only
reason
you
could
believe
it
is
that
you
must
think
that
the
word
"impairment"
has
some
objective
content
in
and
of
itself.
that
some
things
just
aren't
an
impairment.
otherwise,
i
don't
see
the
basis
for
even
a
de
minimis
rule.
unknown
speaker
okay,
so
the
secretary
has
to
give
some
content
to
the
word
"impairment".
unknown
speaker
no,
it
hasn't.
it
says
that
the
impairment
shall
not
be
found
disabling
unless
such
and
such
things,
and
it
says
other
things
about
when
an
impairment
will
be
disabling
or
not,
but
the
statute
never
does
say
what
is
an
impairment
in
so
many
words,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes.
in
addition
to
being
an
impairment,
it
has
to
be
a
medically
determinable
one,
in
addition,
but
you
still
have
to
start
off
with...
you
don't
go
anywhere
unless
you
have
an
impairment
to
begin
with.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
the
statute
expressly
defines
the
term
"impairment"
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
the
statute
expressly
defines
the
term
"impairment"
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
are
you
able
to
answer
my
question
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
and
how
do
you
answer
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
extent
of
the
statutory
definition
of
impairment?
unknown
speaker
can
there
be
in
your
mind
such
a...
something
that
could
exclude
the
person
at
step
2
even
if
the
impairment
keeps
him
from
doing
his
or
her
old
job?
unknown
speaker
nothing
can
be
that...
if
it
keeps
him
from
doing
his
or
her
old
job
it
just
isn't
that
minor
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
a
different
question
than
asking
whether
the
person
can
perform
his
or
her
old
job?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
really
don't
acknowledge
a
de
minimis
exception
then.
i
thought
you
acknowledged
it.
unknown
speaker
what
you
have
just
said
means
that
you
have
to
flunk
step
1
before
you
can
flunk
step
2.
that
is
no
exception
at
all.
you
say
no
matter
how
minimal
the
impairment
is,
if
it
is
an
impairment
that
stops
you
from
doing
your
current
job,
it
qualifies.
but
then
step
2
is
useless,
because
that
test
is
step
1.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
my
question.
i
am
really
trying
to
pin
down
whether
you
acknowledge...
your
briefs
seem
to
acknowledge
that
there
was
a
certain
de
minimis
level
where
step
2
could
have
some
effect,
but
what
you
just
said
in
response
to
the
last
question
indicates
that
you
don't
acknowledge
any
effect
for
step
2.
unknown
speaker
than
step
1,
so
you
are
saying
step
2
is
useless.
if
you
pass
step
1
you
automatically
pass
step
2.
unknown
speaker
your
example
would
be
the
airline
pilot
who
can
no
longer
pass
the
vision
test,
but
might
well
be
able
to
do
lots
of
things,
and
you
would
say
the
regulation
would
improperly
disqualify
him
because,
simply
because
he
couldn't
do
his...
i
mean,
simply
because
he
can't
pass
the...
i
mean,
simply
because
it
is
quite
obvious
on
its
face
that
there
are
a
lot
of
other
jobs
that
a
well
trained
pilot
could
perform.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
he
is
entitled
to...
he
passed...
he
must
pass
the
severe
impairment...
he
must
pass
step
2.
unknown
speaker
the
airline
pilot
whose
vision
is
just
not
quite
good
enough
to
pass
the
faa
regulation
standards.
what
about
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
take
an
airline
pilot,
take
an
airline
pilot
with
a
sufficient
cardiovascular
disease
not
to
be
able
to
continue
to
pass
the
medical
exam,
but
he
looks
to
be
pretty
healthy
for
most
other
things.
you
say
he--
unknown
speaker
--the
statute
requires
that
he
survive.
unknown
speaker
even
though
common
sense
would
tell
you
that
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
jobs
this
particular
individual
could
do,
right?
unknown
speaker
why
should
he
have
to
make
that
further
determination
if
it
is
so
obvious
that
an
airline
pilot
with
20-30
vision
can
do
all
sorts
of
things?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
the
possibility
that
in
passing
this
law
congress
was
only
willing
to
compensate
people
for
impairments,
and
that
some
things
it
considered
so
trivial
that
they
were
not
impairments,
and
you
get
no
compensation.
take
the
example
i
gave
you
before--
unknown
speaker
--of
some
distortion
in
taste
now,
that
would
not
make
any
difference
to
most
people,
but
if
you
happen
to
be
the
tetley
tea
taster,
you
are
suddenly
out
of
a
job.
now,
as
i
understand
your
analysis,
that
person
has
to
go
on
through
the
rest
of
the...
you
know,
through
the
rest
of
the
procedure
and
gets
compensation
if
he
can
show
that--
unknown
speaker
--he
is
65
years
old.
he
has
a
lot
of
other
problems.
really,
the
only
thing
the
poor
fellow
is
good
for
is
tasting
tea.
he
used
to
be
very
good
at
that,
and
now
he
has
this
sudden
dysfunction
of
his
taste
buds.

speaker

you
got

unknown
speaker
it
is

conceivable
to
me
that
congress
did
not
mean
that
by
an
impairment,
that
congress
meant
something
more
substantial
than
that
by
an
impairment.
unknown
speaker
his
impairment
is
that
he
just
doesn't
taste
things
as
well
as
he
used
to,
or
as
well
as
a
younger
person
might
or
an
normal
person
might.
unknown
speaker
ms.
grossman,
may
i
inquire
whether
you
think
that
the
guidelines
adopted
in
ssr
8528
adequately
explain
what
should
happen
at
step
2?
unknown
speaker
it
does,
though,
clarify
the
fact
that
it
is
only
a...
something
that
has
more
than
a
minimal
effect
on
a
person's
ability
to
do
basic
work
activities,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
as
we
read
it
here,
when
it
says
that
a
claim
may
be
denied
at
step
2
only
if
the
evidence
shows
the
individual's
impairments
are
not
medically
severe.
do
you
quarrel
with
that?
unknown
speaker
those
decisions
didn't
have
in
mind
the
guideline
in
8528,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
you
said
a
while
ago
that
all
the
courts
of
appeals
have
disagreed
with
the
secretary's
construction
and
application
of
the
regulation.
now,
is
there
a
construction
he
has
put
on
it
that
is
not...
that
isn't
revealed
by
the
words
of
the
regulation
or
what?
if
you
were
reading--
unknown
speaker
--if
there
had
never
been
a
construction
of
it
or
an
application
of
it.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
is
enough
to
invalidate
it?
unknown
speaker
ms.
grossman,
one
of
the
points
in
the
government's
case
that
i
found
quite
persuasive
was
their
reference
to
the
'84
amendment
to
the
benefits
reform
act,
and
i
don't
recall
that
your
brief
responded
to
that.
if
it
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--i
knew
you
would
want
to.
unknown
speaker
they
went
back
and
approved
what
existed
in
'78
and
not
what
was
existing
in
'84
when
they
passed
it?
i
mean,
the
statute...
never
mind
the
legislative
history.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
as
enacted
says,
refers
to
medical
severity
as
a
threshold
test.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
telling
me
that
at
the
time
the
secretary
was
using
a
particular
system
to
determine
medical
severity
which
the
congress
presumably
knew
about
and
it
was
not
that
system
that
the
'84
amendment
meant
to
approve
but
the
system
that
had
previously
existed
in
'78.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
that
the
secretary...
and
this...
i
am
really
not
sure
what
you
two
are
arguing
about.
is
it
very
clear
that
the
secretary's
test
does
not
meet
the
language
that
you
quoted
from
the
conference
report?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
grossman.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
