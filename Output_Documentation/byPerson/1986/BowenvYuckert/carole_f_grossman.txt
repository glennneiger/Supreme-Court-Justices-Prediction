ms.
carole
f.
grossman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
congress
created
the
disability
insurance
program
with
a
specific
goal
in
mind.
that
was
to
provide
benefits
to
fully
insured
workers
whose
medically
determinable
impairments
prevented
them
from
working.
the
secretary
has
designed
through
the
severity
regulation
a
mechanism
which
prevents
many
disabled
workers
from
establishing
their
eligibility
for
benefits.
the
court
of
appeals
as
well
as
ten
other
courts
of
appeals
have
found
the
secretary's
construction
and
use
of
the
severity
regulation
is
illegal
in
that
it
denies
claimants
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
their
medically
determinable
impairments
in
fact
prevent
them
from
working.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
some
were
in
individual
cases,
and
some
were
class
actions.
there
are
classes--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--i
take
issue
with
the
reading
that
even
the
ninth
circuit
declared--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--all
the
courts
of
appeals
who
have
invalidated
the
regulation
have
found
that
it
is
invalid
by
its
terms
as
well
as
by
its
application.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
yes,
it--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--yes,
it
has
been--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--it
has
been
found
invalid
both
by
its
terms
and
as
applied.
the
conflict
between
the
severity
regulation
and
the
social
security
act
is
straightforward.
the
act
defines
disability
as
"the
inability
to
engage
in
any
substantial
gainful
activity
by
reason
of
any
medically
determinable
physical
or
mental
impairment."
of
sufficient
duration.
the
definition
clearly
measures
the
disabling
impact
of
an
impairment
in
vocational
terms.
this
court
recognized
in
heckler
v.
campbell
in
1983--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--justice
scalia,
there
is
a
definition
that
was
provided
by
the
'67
amendment
which
fills
out
the
definition
of
an
impairment.
in
the
basic
statutory
definition,
we
say
medically
determinable.
there
is
a
fuller
elaboration
of
that
in
the
'67
amendments
which
indicates
that
it
must
be
one
which
can
be
diagnosed
and
supported
by
clinical
findings.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
well,
there--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
well,
we
do
not
dispute
that
there
must
be
a
medical
basis
for
entitlement
to
disability
benefits.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
whether
we
are
going
to
talk
about
the
word
"severe"
or
whether
we
are
going
to
talk
about
the
word
"impairment"
what
we
have
to
look
at
is
the
standard
that
is
applied.
there
is
no
dispute--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--that
a
medical
basis
is
necessary.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
the
secretary
would
be
entitled
to
screen
out
those
claims
which
are
so
groundless
on
a
common
sense
basis,
as
the
first
circuit
says--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--that
they
could
never
be
found
disabling
despite
the
vocational
analysis.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
well,
the
de
minimis
rule
does
use
the
word
"impairment".
it
does
use
"slight
abnormality".
the
definition
which
was
in
effect
prior
to
this
regulation
used
the
terms
"slight
abnormality",
did
not
use
the
word
"impairment".
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
well,
the
statute
has
given
the
word
"impairment"
its
meaning.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
well,
again,
justice
scalia,
i
suggest
that
the
term
"medically
determinable
impairment"
has
some
significance
and
that
the--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--that's
correct.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
i
am
saying
that
the--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--as
a
medically
determinable--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--yes,
i
am
able
to
answer
your
question.
a
medically--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--i
am
saying
there
is
another
provision
which
elaborates
on
medically
determinable
as
a
physiologically
based
anatomically
based
impairment
that
is
capable
of
being
documented
by
clinical
and
laboratory
techniques.
that
is
as
much
as
the
statute
answers
in
terms
of
the
word
itself.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
that's
correct.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
no,
we
do
not
believe...
it
is
respondent's--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--that's
right.
what
proof
of
inability
to
do
prior
work
does
is
to
conform
to
one
of
the
central
statutory
questions,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
impairment
prevents
the
individual
from
performing
substantial
gainful
activity.
the
entire
establishment--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--it
is
the
preliminary
question
to
the
ultimate
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
person
can
perform
any
work
in
the
national
economy.
the
cases
which
have
interpreted
the
act,
all
12
circuits
have
interpreted
the
act
to
show,
to
require
the
claimant
to
prove
that
they
could
not
do
their
prior
work.
once
that
showing
is
made,
there
is
an
evidentiary
shift
of
burdens
to
the
secretary
to
produce
evidence
that
there
is
other
work
in
the
national
economy
which
the
claimant
can
do.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
yes--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--justice
scalia,
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
not
a
meaningless
standard,
the
inability
to
perform
prior
work,
and
every
court
of
appeal
in
the
country
has
interpreted
the
act
to
require
that
showing,
so
that--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--i
am
sorry
if
i
gave
that
impression.
our
position
is
clearly
that
you
may
not
impose
a
de
minimis
standard
which
imposes
a
higher
threshold
than
the
claimant's
proof
that
they
cannot
do
their
prior
work.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
no,
because
step
1
has
nothing
to
do
with
proving
that
you
can
do
your
prior
work.
step
1
is
simply
an
evaluation
of
whether
you
are
currently
engaged
in
substantial
gainful
activity.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
well,
i
think--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--the
threshold--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--he
has...
he
would
survive
a
threshold
inquiry.
i
think
a
better
example
are
the
portraits
of
people
who
are
denied
most
commonly
by
the
severity
regulation.
those
are
individuals
with
multiple
impairments,
pulmonary
obstructive
disease,
cardiovascular
disease,
seizure
disorders,
who
clearly
cannot
perform
their
prior
work.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
he
would
survive...
he
would
survive
a--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--the
statute
requires
that
he
survive
the
threshold
test,
and
he
will
go
on,
and
the
secretary
will
be
able
to
examine
whether
or
not
there
is
other
work
in
the
national
economy
which
he
is
capable
of
performing.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
well,
and
it
will
be
extremely
easy,
and
that
is
the
point
of
this
court's
decision
in
heckler
v.
campbell
invalidating
the
regulations,
because
the
medical
vocational
guidelines
allow
the
secretary
with
ease
to
determine
whether
or
not
someone
with
his
qualifications,
of
his
age,
education,
work
experience,
and
skills
can
do
other
work
in
the
economy.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
well,
justice
white,
i
would
suggest
that
that
case
is
one
which
will
be
easily
accomplished.
it
is
not
the
case
of
the
thousands
of
disabled
workers
who
were
denied
at
the
severity
regulation.
it
is
not
as
easy
when
you
have
an
older
individual
with
a
marginal
education
and
a
history
of
prior
work
limited
to
heavy
unskilled
work.
then
i
think
it
is
not...
you
cannot
say
clearly
totally
on
a
discretionary
basis
their
impairments
are
nonsevere,
we
don't
have
to
look
at
their
vocational
analysis.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
no,
i'm
sorry--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--well,
if
he
were
65,
of
course,
he
would
be
eligible
for
retirement
benefits,
but
if
he
is
younger--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--if
he
is
younger
than
65--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--if
he
is
younger
than
65
and
he
has
no
transferable
skills
and
his
impairments
seriously
prevent
him
from
working,
then
the
medical
vocational
guidelines
would
direct
a
finding
of
disability.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
i'm
sorry.
what
was
your
example
of
his
impairment?
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
well,
in
that
case
he
may
not
have
a
medically
determinable
impairment.
let's
not
forget
that
there
is
no
contest
on
respondent's
part
that
impairments
need
a
medical
basis.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
justice
o'connor,
the
social
security
ruling
8528
is
ambiguous.
its
content
is
ambiguous.
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
whether
or
not
any
change
has
occurred
from
the
severity
regulation.
i
think
that
the
secretary
has
recently
argued
that
it
does
not
constitute
a
change.
although
there
are
some
procedural
protections
offered
that
are
clearly
not
in
the
regulation
itself,
such
as
a
great
care
standard,
the
standard
itself
remains
a
substitution
of
basic
work
activities
for
the
ability
to
do
prior
work.
in
that
sense
the
standard
itself
has
not
changed.
i
thin
it
is
important
to
note
that--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--it
does
use
the
language
of
a
de
minimis
threshold.
i
agree.
what
concerns
respondent
is
that
most
recently
the
secretary
argues
both
in
reply
and
before
this
court
that
it
does
not
matter
whether
a
de
minimis
standard
is
articulated,
although
the
secretary
insists
that
there
is
a
de
minimis
standard
in
the
new
ruling,
in
the
interpretive
ruling,
in
their
reply
they
argue
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
there
is
a
de
minimis
standard
because
the
entire
regulation
has
been
ratified.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
no,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
i
think
the
greatest
problem
in
this
case
is
figuring
out
what
terms
mean,
and
the
only
way
you
can
figure
out
what
terms
mean
is
to
see
how
the
regulation
is
construed
and
applied
by
the
secretary.
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
the
issue
has
found
that
the
secretary's
construction
and
use
of
the
severity
regulation
violates
the
social
security
act
because
it
does
deny
claimants
who
are
potentially
disabled
under
the
definition
of
the
act.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
well,
two
courts
of
appeals
have
now
considered
8528.
the
tenth
circuit
has
rejected
it
as
not
representing
any
change,
and
therefore
the
conflict
between
the
regulation
and
the
ruling
being...
still
existing.
the
first
circuit
has
read
8528
as
an
indication
that
the
secretary
has
changed
his
policy
and
says
that
if
there
hadn't
been
that
change
there
would
be
a
serious
question
in
the
circuit's
mind
whether
or
not
more
judicial
interference
were
necessary,
but
the
first
circuit,
it
is
important
to
note,
reads
8528
consistent
with
a
de
minimis
standard
insofar
as
it
says
that
if
a
claimant
cannot
do
their
prior
work,
then
it
does
not
matter
the
particular
level
of
severity,
that
claimant
is
entitled
to
an
evaluation
under
the
act.
the
secretary
in
his
reply
brief
has
repudiated
that
reading
of
8528
so
we
are
left
with
only
one
circuit
court
embracing
8528
as
a
change,
and
the
secretary
now
saying
you
may
not
read
this
as
the
de
minimis
standard
which
you
are
reading
it
as.
if
you
do
we
disagree.
i
think
the
secretary
has
made
clear
today
that
there
is
disagreement.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
the
terms--
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
--okay,
if
you
just
read
the
words,
the
language
clearly
substitutes.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
there
is
a
substitute
of
basic
work
activities
for
an
inquiry
into
the
ability
to
perform
prior
work.
that
overbroad
irrebuttable
presumption
which
the
secretary
in
other
rulings
agrees
produces
fallacious
and
insupportable
findings
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
somebody
can
actually
work,
that
is
clear
on
the
face
of
the
regulation.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
the
lack
of
consideration.
i
think
what
is
more
significant
is
that
the
regulation
clearly
spells
out
that
there
will
be
no
consideration
of
those
vocational
factors
of
age,
education,
and
work
experience
which
the
statute
clearly
identifies
as
relevant
to
the
determination
of
disability.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
thank
you,
justice
scalia,
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
talk
about
the
'84
amendments.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
the
'84...
there
is
a
lot
of
controversy
about
whether
the
house
or
the
senate
report
should
be
looked
to
to
understand
what
happened
in
the
legislative
history.
it
is
respondent's
position
that
the
conferees'
report
is
the
most
authoritative
guide
to
what
was
at
least
agreed
to
in
congress.
the
conferees'
report
very
carefully
defines
a
de
minimis
standard.
it
says
an
individual...
that
a
determination
may
be
made
that
an
individual
is
not
disabled
based
on
a
judgment
that
an
individual
has
no
impairment
or
that
the
medical
severity
of
his
impairment
or
combination
of
impairments
is
slight
enough,
slight
enough
to
warrant
a
presumption
even
without
a
full
evaluation
of
vocational
factors
that
the
individual's
ability
to
perform
sga
is
not
seriously
affected.
that
is
a
standard
which
was
in
effect
prior
to
the
promulgation
of
the
severity
regulation
in
1978.
that
is
what
is
called
a
slightness
standard.
for
the
conferees
to
say
that
they
did
not
mean
to
impair
the
use
of
such
a
presumption
is...
indicates
that
there
is
no
ratification
of
the
current
severity
policy.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
okay.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
that's
correct.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
they...
the
conferees
noted
that
the
secretary
was
in
the
middle
of
reevaluating
the
criteria.
the
house
expressed
a
great
deal
of
concern
that
this
reevaluation
be
done
expeditiously.
the
secretary
had
assured
congress
that
they
were
reevaluating
the
nonsevere
impairment
criteria,
so
that
this
statement
of
the
conferees
stands
as
a
guide
to
the
secretary
to
what
they
would
find
to
be
an
acceptable
de
minimis
threshold
inquiry
with
the...
notice
that
they
say
even
without
a
full
evaluation
of
vocational
factors.
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
they
intended
to
substitute
a
test
of
medical
severity
of
a
very
high
threshold
for
the
analysis
that
is
called
for
in
the
statute.
ms.
carole
f.
grossman
may
i
say
that
every
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
issue
has
found
that
the
secretary's
test
does
not
meet
that
standard.
the
courts
of
appeals
which
have
not
invalidated
the
regulation
but
which
have
imposed
a
narrowing
construction
on
the
regulation
and
said
to
the
secretary,
unless
you
reference
your
decisions
on
the
nonsevere
regulation
to
this
court's
opinion
telling
you
how
the
regulation
must
be
interpreted
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
the
act,
then
we
will
simply
remand
those
decisions
because
we
cannot
tolerate
your
interpretation
of
the
act
through
the
implementation
of
this
regulation.
now,
we
would
argue
that
invalidation
of
the
regulation
is
a
less
intrusive
means
of
correcting
the
secretary's
interpretation.
it
leaves
the
secretary
free
to
develop
his
own
de
minimis
standard
or
to
skip
step
2
as
in
1978
he
said
he
had
some
questions
about
whether
or
not
the
severity
regulation
produced
all
the
efficiency
measures
and
uniformity
that
they
had
expected
it
would,
and
that
it
might
be
just
as
easy
to
use
the
previous
methods,
which
were
consistent,
i
would
argue,
consistent
with
the
act
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
person
could
do
their
prior
work,
and
then
on
to
the
vocational
factors
once
they
made
that
prima
facie
showing.
the
severity
regulation
has
been
preliminarily
or
permanently
judicially
enjoined
in
more
than
20
states,
yet
many
disabled
workers
continue
to
have
their
claims
summarily
and
illegally
denied
on
the
basis
of
the
regulation.
until
the
conflict
between
the
severity
regulation
and
the
social
security
act
is
resolved
by
regulatory
revision
pursuant
to
the
apa,
there
will
be
no
resolution.
interpretive
rulings
