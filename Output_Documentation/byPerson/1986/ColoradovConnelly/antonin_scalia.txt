are
you
sure
that
you
answered
justice
stevens'
question
correctly?
i
hadn't
understood
that
to
be
the
argument
you
were
making
here,
that
as
a
factual
matter
you
want
us
to
overturn
the
district
court's
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
your
argument
is
that
the
district
court's
finding
was
based
upon
a
misperception
of
the
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
to
what
a
voluntary
waiver
of
miranda
rights
consists
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
couldn't
understand
why
you
paused
so
long.

justice

scalia
i
was
sure
that
was
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
van
cleave,
suppose
it
wasn't
god
who
had
told
mr.
connelly
but
rather
it
was
his
brother-in-law
who
said,
frank,
unless
you
go
back
to
denver
and
confess,
i
am
going
to
beat
the
devil
out
of
you.
and
in
terror
of
his
brother-in-law,
he
comes
up
to
a
policeman.
would
that
fall
under
the
same
rule
that
you
are
urging
on
us
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
his
wife
said
to
him,
frank,
i
can't
live
with
you
knowing
that
you
haven't
paid
your
debt
to
society,
unless
you
go
back
to
denver
and
confess
i
am
going
to
leave
you
and
take
the
children
with
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
want
to
know
what
is
the
limit?
i
mean,
once
you
say
that
you
are
under
coercion
to
confess...
what
about
just
the
normal
religious
coercion?
suppose
i
have
religious
views
that
think
that
i
should
pay
my
just
debt
to
society?
is
that
a
coercion
that
would
render
my...
you
see,
when
you
say
voluntary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
know
why
in
the
world
anyone
would
voluntarily
confess.
there
is
always
some
kind
of
coercion,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
anyone
voluntarily
confess?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
either
his
conscience,
his
wife,
or
his
brother-in-law,
or
god
who
is
coercing
him
to
confess.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
the
voices
crucial?
i
mean,
suppose
he
just
came
in
and
he
said,
i
am...
my
religion
compels
me,
or
i
am
born
again,
and
i
am
sure
that
god
wants
me
to
confess.
i
haven't
heard
voices,
but
i
just...
i
just
believe
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
that
goes
to
how
sane
he
is,
but
it
does
not
go
at
all
to
what
degree
of
compulsion
he
is
under.
certainly
the
person
who
just
in
conscience
believes
that
god
wants
him
to
confess
without
hearing
god's
voice
is
under
as
much
compulsion.
all
you
are
establishing
by
the
voices
is
that
the
man
is
a
little
bit
funny,
but
that
doesn't
at
all
affect
the
degree
of
compulsion,
so
how
do
you
just
distinguish
the
case
where
the
man
confesses
out
of
a
religious
belief
that
that
is
the
right
thing
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
pursue
your
answer
to...
i
gather
in
response
to
the
court's
questioning
you
are
now
saying
that
the
difference
here
is
that
it
was
a
psychiatrist
who
had
told
this
man...
who
had
certified
that
this
man
was
not
right
and
was...
i
guess
that
means
the
distinction
you
are
drawing
is
between
erroneous
compulsion,
that
is,
a
person
who
believes
he
is
under
compulsion
when
he
really
isn't,
that
makes
the
confession
bad,
but
if
he
really
was
under
compulsion
it
is
okay.
and
let's
take
a
perfectly
sane
man
whose
brother-in-law
says
he
is
going
to
beat
the
devil
out
of
him
unless
he
confesses,
that
is
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
another
principle.
i
don't
see
how
the
insanity
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
what
is
it
that
makes
the
compulsion
greater
or
lesser
and
therefore
more
distorting
of
the
legal
process?
is
it
the
fact
that
the
fellow
was
mistaken
about
the
compulsion.
is
that
the
crucial
factor?
there
really
wasn't
a
voice
of
god,
and
therefore
that
compulsion
we
won't
allow
but
we
will
allow
the
compulsion
of
his
brother-in-law
or
of
his
wife
leaving
or
of
anything
else
you
want
to
name.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
am
suggesting
i
still
don't
see
a
line.
i
don't
see
where
it
ends
between
the
psychotic
individual--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
the
way
down
to
the
drunk
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
trial
court
here
rest
its
decision
on
the
knowing
element
as
opposed
to
the
voluntary
element?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
make...
i
mean,
you
have
asserted
that
the
insanity
could
have
affected
the
knowing
element,
perhaps.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
its
discussion
went
to
the
voluntary
element
entirely,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
any
of
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
sound
like
knowledge.
it
sounds
like
volition.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
on
the
volition
side.
