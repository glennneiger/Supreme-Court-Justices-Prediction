mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case
the
uncontradicted
medical
evidence
at
the
suppression
hearing
established
that
francis
connelly
was
afflicted
with
a
chronic
paranoid
schizophrenia
at
the
time
he
walked
up
to
officer
anderson
and
stated
he
wanted
to
confess
a
murder.
this
is
the
statement
that
is
under
the
voluntariness
aspect.
after
he
made
that
statement,
officer
anderson
advised
him
of
his
rights,
and
as
the
people
indicate,
took
him
into
custody.
further
questioning
resulted
in
further
statements,
and
eventually
mr.
connelly
led
the
police
to
a
location
where
he
said
he
had
killed
a
woman.
we
acknowledge
that
officer
anderson
did
absolutely
nothing
in
this
case
but
to
listen
to
mr.
connelly's
statement
in
admitting
that
he
had
killed
someone.
the
trial
court
ruled
that
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
mr.
connelly's--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--oh,
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
am
speaking
now
strictly
as
to
the
initial
statement.
i
am
going
to
bifurcate
this
and
speak
first
to
the
initial
statement
and
then
later
i
will
speak
to
the
subsequent
statements
that
were
taken
as
result
of
police
custody.
i
might
add
that
dr.
metzner...
the
way
this...
after
mr.
connelly
was
arrested
and
charged
with
murder,
the
court
ordered
mr.
connelly
to
be
committed
to
the
colorado
state
mental
hospital
for
an
examination
as
to
his
competency,
both
as
to
proceed
further
and
as
to
his
competency
at
the
time
he
made
the
statements.
this
is
in
the
order
of
the
court
and
as
contained
in
the
pleadings.
he
was
examined
by
dr.
jeffrey
metzner
of
the
colorado
state
mental
hospital.
dr.
metzner
found
that
mr.
connelly
was
incompetent
to
proceed,
and
mr.
connelly
was
then
held
in
the
colorado
state
mental
hospital
for
some
five
or
six
months
until
he
was
examined
again
by
dr.
metzner
and
found
competent
to
proceed.
at
the
time
of
the
initial
examination
dr.
metzner,
with
respect
to
the
request
of
the
court
that
he
examine
mr.
connelly
as
to
his
competence
at
the
time
of
the
making
of
the
confession,
stated
in
his
report,
and
this
is
on
page
17
of
the
pleadings,
the
last
page
of
his
report,
"based
on
my
examination
of
mr.
connelly,
it
is
my
opinion
that
he
was
experiencing
psychotic
symptoms
during
the
time
immediately
preceding
and
following
his
alleged
confession
to
the
police.
"
now,
we
are
initially
contesting
the
admittedly
volunteered
statement
to
officer
anderson
on
the
grounds
of
due
process
voluntariness.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
that
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--the
flaw
was
that
that
statement
under
principles
of
this
court
which
were
developed
over
the
period
of
years
in
the
area
of
involuntary...
due
process
involuntariness
of
confessions,
that
statement
to
officer
anderson,
we
contend,
was
an
involuntary
confession
because
of
mr.
connelly's
deficient
mental
condition.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
none
of
those
cases,
your
honor,
involve
absolutely
no
state
action.
some
of
the
cases
that
we
rely
on
primarily
are
townsend
versus
saln
and
blackburn
versus
alabama,
in
which
the
court
stated...
in
townsend
the
court
indicated
that
absent,
even
absent
improper
police
practices,
a
defendant's
mental
condition
can
still
be
sufficient
so
as
to
render
a
confession
he
gave
involuntary,
and
its
admission
and
use
at
trial
is
the
due
process...
or
the
due
process
violation,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
if
you
have
a
factual
finding
by
the
trial
court
of
actual
coercion.
there
are
a
number
of
state
law
cases
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
we
are
talking
about...
here
we
have
substantial--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
think
you
have
to
look--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
i
understand
that
there
is
a
problem
in
the
limits
that
can
be
drawn,
and
i
a
not
sure
i
can--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--i
am
not
sure
i
can
satisfactorily
draw
any
limits.
i
can
only
say
that
here
where
the
evidence
was
so
overwhelming
that
mr.
connelly's
mental
capacity
and
volition
was
so
overwhelmed
by
his
mental
illness
that
here
the
confession
is
involuntary.
in
other
situations--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--your
honor,
the
psychiatrist
who
testified
testified
and
made
the
statement
that
his
cognitive
abilities
were
not
diminished
in
that
he
could
relate
historical
facts.
however,
and
this
went
to
a
question
about
the
miranda
aspect
which...
i
will
answer
your
question
on
that.
he
said
that
his
cognitive
abilities
were
not
diminished,
he
could
understand
what
he
was
being
advised
of,
he
just
couldn't
use
that
information.
his
volitional
capacity
was
totally
nonexistent
because
of
his
mental
condition.
so
the
psychiatrist
did
testify
that
he
did
have...
a
certain
amount
of
cognitive
abilities
were
unaffected
by
the
mental
condition.
but,
no,
i
understand
that
there
is
a
problem
in
drawing
the
line,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
here,
where
there
is
overwhelming
evidence
and
uncontradicted
medical
evidence
that
mr.
connelly's
mental
condition
was
so
psychotic,
he
was
hearing
these
voices,
he
had
no
volitional
abilities
at
all,
that
in
this
situation
under
the
principles
of
the
voluntariness
cases
his
rational
intellect
and
free
will
were
so
impaired
that
he
could
not
give
a
voluntary
confession.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
submit
due
process
is
offended
because
cases
like
blackburn
versus
alabama
and--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--oh,
all
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
am
not
sure
everybody
concedes
it
is
true,
but
i
will
get
to
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--they
didn't...
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
was
part
of
the
record.
they
didn't
get
that
far.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
it
is
our
contention,
your
honor,
that
due
process
requires
that
the
person's
mind
not
be
so
diseased
so
that
all
of
his
volitional
capacities
are
gone.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
because...
well,
think
that
goes
back
to
some
of
the
values
that
are
served
by
excluding
involuntary
confessions.
first
of
all,
i
think
you
mentioned
reliability.
if
you
have
a
person
running
around
who
is
hearing
voices
who
tells
him
to
do
this,
to
do
that,
i
think
that
person's...
the
reliability
of
that
person's
statement--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
can
only
reiterate
that
it
is
our
position
that
somehow
certain
basic
human
dignity
is
offended
by
the
use
of
a
confession
made
by
a
person
who
is
so
mentally
imbalanced
and
defective.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
yes,
the
voices
are
crucial
in
that
they
comprise
a
certain
psychosis
that
had
been
diagnosed.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
think
it
is
based
on
the
evidence
which
indicates
how
strong
the
voices
are
and
the
trial
court's
determination
as
to
how
much
it
believes
that
evidence.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
incompetence
is,
there
is
a
statutory,
you
know,
definition
of
incompetence,
but
i
think
that
is
a
very
significant
factor
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
would
draw
a
distinction
between
a
status--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--pardon?
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
would
draw
a
distinction
between
a
illness
and
a
person
who
has
voluntarily
ingested
alcohol
or
drugs
for
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
again,
i
think
that
it
is
really
the
subjective
impression
in
his
own
mind
as
to
how
such
compulsion
that
causes.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
do
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
it
is
not
easy.
i
don't
agree
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
there
can
be
a
distinction
there.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
there
was
not
a
medical
finding
of
insanity
in
this
case.
it
just...
he
was--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--there...
he
was--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--he
was
ultimately
found
restored
to
competency.
i
am
not
sure
that
there
was
a
finding
one
way
or
the
other
on
insanity.
the
order
of
the
court
was
merely
to
find
competency
or
incompetency.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
around
that...
yes,
give
or
take
a
little
bit,
but
he
was...
he
was
in
the
state
mental
hospital
for
six
months
being
restored
to
competency.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
no,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
he
is
not
in
chambers,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
he
is
in
the
denver
county
jail
at
this
time,
being
held
there
pending
the
outcome
of
this
court's--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--well,
that
was
part
of
the
procedural
aspect
of
the
first
part
of
the
colorado
supreme
court's
opinion.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
this
was
kind
of
a
combined
preliminary
hearing-suppression
hearing--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--and...
pardon?
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
no.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
think
that
there
are
possibly
other
principles
that
might
cause
that
to
be--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--i
can
see
the
distinction
you
are
drawing,
and--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--i
would
say
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--i
would
say
that
in
this
case
with
all
the
evidence
of
the
psychosis
that
there
is
clear
evidence
that
the
person
is
under
compulsion.
if
a
person
is
sane,
there
may
be
evidence,
and
again
the
trier
of
fact
can
weigh
into
that
consideration
that.
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to
the
miranda
aspect.
as
i
have
indicated,
that
after
the
initial
statement
mr.
connelly
was
taken
into
custody
and
asked
questions
and
he
gave
responses
in
response
to
that.
those
questions
were
ordered
suppressed
by
the
trial
court
on
roughly
the
same
psychiatric
testimony
as
the
other
statement.
the
colorado
supreme
court
affirmed
and
based
its
decision
primarily
on
miranda.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
am
not
sure
that
that...
oh,
in
the
trial
court--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
the
trial
court
was
not
explicit
in
delineating
those
two
components
of
the
waiver
requirement.
the
trial
court's
findings
were
primarily
along
volitional
lines
and
that
he
was
unable
to
make
a
free
choice,
and
that
he
basically
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing.
so--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--this
again
is...
well,
not
again.
this
miranda
is
a
fifth
amendment.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
that's
correct.
and
the
miranda
case
basically
found
that
anyone
who
was
in
police
custody
and
subject
to
interrogation
is
subject
to
an
inherent
compulsion,
and
that
inherent
compulsion
is
the
fifth
amendment
link
to
statements
that
were
made
here.
as
justice
white
has
indicated,
there
are
two
components
to
the
waiver
requirement.
there
is
the
voluntary
aspect
and
the
knowing
and
intelligent
aspect.
we
agree
with
the
people
that
there
is
some
linkage
between
the
voluntary
component
of
waiver
and
the
due
process
voluntariness
standards
to
the
extent
that
the
person's
mental
condition
is
considered
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
as
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered.
in
this
case,
as
we
have
discussed,
mr.
connelly's
volitional
capacity
was
diminished,
and
therefore
we
would
submit
that
the
voluntary
component
was
not
compiled
with.
in
addition
to
that,
we
submit
that
the
clear
finding
that
mr.
connelly
was
incompetent
at
the
time
that
he
gave
his
statement
or
at
the
very
least
at
a
time
shortly
thereafter
and
implicitly
at
the
time
he
made
the
statement
affects
the
knowing
and
intelligent
component
as
well.
i
would
cite
this
court's
decisions
in
pate
versus
robinson
and
westbrook
versus
arizona
for
the
proposition
that
a
person
who
is
incompetent
does
not
have
the
capacity
to
make
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
was
a
waiver
of
a
person's
ability
to
stand
trial
or
capacity
to
stand
trial.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
the
miranda
waiver
requirements
are
based
on
the
concept
announced
in
johnson
versus
zerbst
that
the
waiver
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
requires
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
well,
schneckloth
versus
bustamante
held
that
the
knowing
and
intelligent
component
of
the
waiver
requirement
was
inapplicable,
namely,
only
that
the...
in
fact,
it
utilized
the
old
due
process
voluntary
test
for
the
validity
of
waiver
of
a
consent
to
search.
so
i
don't
think
that
schneckloth
really...
other
than
dividing
those
components,
i
don't
think
it
really
addressed
the
knowing
and
intelligent
component
of
the
waiver
requirement.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
you
mean,
in
other
words,
just
a
straight
voluntariness
standard?
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
think
because
miranda
said
that
the
waiver...
that
its
waiver
requirement
required
that
the
person
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
his
rights
to
counsel
and
silence.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
think
that
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
approach
to
a
determination
of
the
validity
of
a
waiver,
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
believe
so.
you
have
to
have
both.
you
have
to
have
both
the
giving
of
the
advisement
and
a
valid
waiver
of
the
advisement
in
order
to
render
any
subsequent
statements
admissible.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
the
trial
court
really
didn't
make
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
--yes.
the
trial
court
did
not
really
make
that
distinction,
your
honor.
the
trial
court
bundled
it
all
up.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
a
lot
of
it
did.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
i
can't
recall
the
exact
words
the
trial
court
used.
what
the
trial
court...
the
trial
court
adopted
dr.
meztner's
statement
that
mr.
connelly
just
was
simply
unable
to
use
the
information
that
he
had
as
far
as
his
ability
to
make
a
choice
between
waiving
or
not
waiving.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
yes,
i
think...
i
think
the
trial
court's
finding
was
more
on
the
volition
side.
mr.
thomas
m.
van
cleave,
iii
but
i
think
the
colorado
supreme
court,
i
think,
examined
both
sides.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
conclude
my
argument.
thank
you.
