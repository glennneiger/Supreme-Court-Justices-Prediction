mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
the
trial
court's
finding.
i
think
the
trial
court
did
first
say
that
respondent
did
not
waive
his
right
voluntarily,
knowingly,
and
intelligently,
but
then
he
went
on
to
give
reasons
for
that
conclusion,
and
that
is
pages
48
to
49
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
he
says,
the
reason
for
that
was
that
respondent,
and
i
am
quoting,
"would
do
anything
to
follow
the
mandate
of
god
to
confess
because
his
only
alternative
was
to
kill
himself.
"
so
it
seems
to
us
pretty
clear
from
the
reasons
that
the
trial
judge
gave
that
what
he
was
in
fact
finding
was
that
the
waiver
was
not
voluntary,
so
we
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
overturn
the
trial
judge's
factual
findings.
we
think
that
the
appropriate
course
is
for
the
court
to
find
that
that
factor
is
just
simply
irrelevant
in
assessing
the
validity
of
the
miranda
waiver.
in
considering
the
questions
that
are
before
the
court
in
this
case,
we
think
it
is
helpful
to
step
back
from
the
two
specific
constitutional
provisions
involved
and
consider
for
a
moment
the
policies
that
are
implicated
by
a
claim
that
evidence
should
be
suppressed.
the
court
has
stated
many
times
the
general
rule
that
society
has
a
right
to
every
man's
evidence,
and
it
is
recognized
that
the
strong
interests
in
law
enforcement
and
the
proper
functioning
of
the
truthseeking
process
favor
placing
all
probative
evidence
before
the
trier
of
fact
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
and
so
the
question
in
this
case
and
in
any
case
where
a
defendant
seeks
to
have
particular
evidence
suppressed
is
whether
that
important
general
rule
should
give
way
because
the
omission
of
the
evidence
would
contravene
another
important
public
policy.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
separate
questions,
but
i
think
they
are
related.
i
think
even
respondent
acknowledges
in
its
brief
that
its
position
is
similar
to
ours,
that
the
same
standard
should
govern
both
the
due
process
issue
and
the
voluntariness
issue,
although
they
have
a
different
standard.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
no,
your
honor.
i
think
our
position
and
i
think
their
position
also
is
that
the
same
values
are
implicated
by
the
two
constitutional
protections
at
issue.
the
court
has
stated
that
the
purpose
of
both
the
due
process
protection
in
the
confession
context
and
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination
is
to
protect
an
individual
from
government
compulsion
to
confess,
and
we
think
in
the
due
process
area
that
means
that
where
there
is
no
government
compulsion
the
admission
of
the
confession
does
not
offend
due
process,
and
in
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
privilege
area
we
think
that
where
there
is
no
government
compulsion,
then
a
waiver
under
miranda
is
valid.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
the
trial
court
specifically
said
that
he
was
not
reaching
the
question
whether
respondent
was
actually
incompetent
at
the
time
he
confessed.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be.
our
position
is
that
the
questions
here
just
go
to
whether
this
evidence
should
be
admitted
at
trial.
they
don't
go
to
how
the
defendant
should
be
punished
or
whether
he
should
be
found
criminally
culpable
for
his
action.
it
just
goes
to
the
question
whether
this
evidence
should
be
submitted
to
the
trier
of
fact,
and
we
think
as
to
that
question
that
the
defendant's,
the
suspect's
competence
or
incompetence
at
the
time
he
makes
the
statement
is
just
irrelevant.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
it
would
be,
your
honor.
of
course,
respondent's
mental
condition
doesn't
present
that
question
here
because
of
the
psychiatrist's
evidence,
but
it
might
be...
we
mention
in
our
brief
that
it
might
be
that
a
suspect's
mental
condition
would
render
him
more
susceptible
to
a
police
suggestion,
and
that
might
be
something
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
the
waiver
was
proper,
but
where
there
is
absolutely
no
government
compulsion
and
where
it
is
clear
that
the
suspect's
mental
condition
would
not
render
him
more
susceptible
to
government
action,
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
to
strike
down
his
waiver.
just
elaborating
a
little
bit
on
the
miranda
issue,
i
think
the
court
last
term
in
moran
against
burbine
made
clear
that
the
miranda
waiver
inquiry
should
be
shaped
with
reference
to
the
purposes
of
miranda
and
the
purposes
of
the
self-incrimination
privilege
that
miranda
is
designed
to
protect,
and
here
it
seems
quite
clear
that
there
is
no
reason
in
this
case
to
forbid
the
introduction
of
respondent's
confessions
into
evidence
because
there
is
no
possibility
that
they
were
obtained
by
government
compulsion.
so
there
is
no--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor,
we
think
that
that
is
a
question
for
the
jury,
and
if
the
confession
is
admitted
into
evidence
the
defendant
would
have
an
opportunity
to
put
before
the
jury
all
of
the
relevant
circumstances
surrounding
the
confession.
the
jury
would
be
able
to
weigh
those
questions
of
reliability,
and
the
trial
judge,
of
course,
under
evidentiary
rules
does
exercise
some
discretion
in
deciding
whether
particular
evidence
is
more
prejudicial
than
probative,
and
it
might
be
that
it
wouldn't
be
admissible
on
those
grounds,
but
we
don't
think
that
these
constitutional
provisions--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
waiver
would
still
be
good
in
this
case,
because
the
confession--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
in
both
cases--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--in
your
hypothetical
because
the
confession
still
would
not
have
been
obtained
by
government
compulsion,
and
that
is
what
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
designed
to
protect
against.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
if
that
compulsion
isn't
present,
we
just
think
that
there
is
no
problem
with
admitting
into
evidence.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
because
that
is
the
only
requirement
that
is
imposed
by
the
self-incrimination
privilege.
we
think
if
that
wasn't
the
rule
the
results,
as
i
was
saying,
would
be
quite
peculiar,
because
the
situation
would
be
that
quite
probative
evidence
would
be
barred
from
the
trier
of
fact
where
it
wasn't
possible--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
but
it
wouldn't
be...
in
this
situation...
where
the
police
exert
the
coercion,
that
is
where
the
privilege
is
implicated.
where
there
is
absolutely
no
police
coercion,
the
underlying
privilege
isn't
implicated,
and
it
would
be
quite
peculiar
to
read
miranda
to
exclude
a
whole
class
of
evidence
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
underlying
constitutional
value.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
and
as
we
set
forth
more
fully
in
our
brief,
what
could
flow
from
the
colorado
supreme
court's
ruling
really
is
a
whole
parade
of
possibilities
of
questions
about
free
will
and
questions
about
whether
particular
evidence
could
be
excluded
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
confession
context.
there
often
are
situations
where
suspects
have
compulsions
to
leave
clues
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
or
to
write
incriminating
letters
to
the
police,
and
under
the
theory
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
adopted
those...
that
evidence
also
might
be
subject
to
exclusion
on
the
grounds
that
it
wasn't
the
product
of
a
free
will,
and
we
think
that
where
there
is
no
government
compulsion
implicated,
that
there
is
no
reason
to
preclude
the
trier
of
fact
from
considering
that
evidence.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
