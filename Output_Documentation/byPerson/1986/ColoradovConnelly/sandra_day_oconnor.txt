mr.
coats,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
colorado
as
a
matter
of
state
law
requires
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof
for
waiver
of
miranda
rights?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
understand.
is
it
your
position
that
the
colorado
courts
understand
that
no
federal
decision
from
this
court
has
required
it,
but
that
they
require
a
higher
standard
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
a
defendant's
competence
to
the
extent
that
it
goes
to
his
cognitive
ability
at
the
time
is
relevant
to
the
miranda
waiver
inquiry,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
evidence
here
that
his
cognitive
capacity
was
diminished?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
van
cleave,
what
about
someone
who
gets
more
talkative
after
consuming
alcohol
and
happens
to
be
stopped
on
a
traffic
offense
by
the
policeman
and
confesses
to
another
crime
in
the
process?
now,
under
your
theory
i
guess
that
also
enters
into
the
balance
as
to
whether
that
can
come
in.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
someone
who
is
on
drugs.
