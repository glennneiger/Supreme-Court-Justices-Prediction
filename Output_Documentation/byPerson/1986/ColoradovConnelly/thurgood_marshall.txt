justice

--i
have
trouble
finding...
when
a
man
walks
up
and
says
"i
want
to
confess",
i
have
trouble
finding
miranda
in
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
been
arguing
miranda
ever
since
you
have
been
up
there.
you
have
been
arguing
miranda.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
what
possible
constitutional
provision
or
what
law
in
the
world
can
prohibit
a
man
from
standing
up
and
saying
"i
did
it".
what
is
wrong
with
that?
what
fourteenth
amendment
problems
are
involved?
you
mean
a
man
can't
confess?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
but
why
do
you
have
to
bring
miranda
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
forget
that
you
have
a
statement
uncontradicted
by
a
reliable
authority,
a
psychiatrist,
who
said
that
this
man
was
nuts--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--when
he
made
that
statement
about
god.
don't
put
that
with
a
person
who
is
perfectly
sane
and
is
told
by
the
minister.
that
is
entirely
different.
this
man
was
insane.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--how
could
you
forget
it?
you
don't
agree
he
was
insane,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
committed
for
six
months.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
definitely
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
mentality.
