chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-660,
colorado
versus
francis
barry
connelly.
mr
coats,
we
will
wait
just
a
minute
until
the
crowd
clears
out,
assuming
they
are
planning
to
do
that.
you
may
proceed
any
time
you
are
ready,
mr.
coats.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
due
process
clause,
mr.
coats,
of
course,
says
you
shan't
be
denied
due
process
by
the
state.
what
was
the
colorado
supreme
court's
answer
as
to
how
the
state
denied
due
process
when,
as
justice
marshall
points
out,
the
man
simply
said
"i
want
to
confess"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
regardless
of
the
fact
there
was
no
police,
as
you
say,
no
causal
connection
between
the
police
action
and
the
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
trial
court's
understanding
of
mental
incompetence
was
erroneous
in
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coats.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
pincus,
what
if
the
defendant
at
a
trial
like
this
claims
that
a
confession
being
offered
was
beaten
out
of
him
by
his
brother-in-law,
who
is
a
private
individual?
now,
can
the
defendant
attack
that
only
on
the
grounds
of
its
trustworthiness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
van
cleave.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what...
that
violates
in
your
view
the
prohibition
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
no
state
shall
deprive
any
person
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
did
the
state
deprive
this
person
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law,
by
admitting
that
first
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how?
i
mean,
by
admitting
it
in
the
trial,
and
what
was
the
fatal
flaw
in
that
first
statement
that
resulted
in
the
denial
of
due
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
which
of
those
cases
involved
no
state
or
police
causal
connection
that
you
are
relying
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
van
cleave,
why
isn't
due
process
satisfied
in
a
situation
like
this?
let's
assume
you
are
right,
that
the
state
connection
here
is
the
use
of
the
statement
at
trial.
why
isn't
due
process
satisfied
by
saying
that
he
is
entitled
to
challenge
the
truthfulness,
the
accuracy
of
the
confession?
why
is
due
process
offended
by
admitting
a
statement
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
let's
get
away
from
the
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
give
a
statement
as
to
why
is
due
process
offended
by
admitting
a
statement
that
was
not
in
any
way
coerced
by
any
state
actor,
and
that
everyone
apparently
concedes
is
true?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
were
you
denied
any
opportunity
to
challenge
the
truthfulness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
any
rate,
presumably
if
this
were
reversed
you
could
go
back
and
challenge
the
truthfulness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
would
be
given
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
truthfulness.
what
more
does
due
process
require
under
these
circumstances?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
don't
think
the
state
challenges
here
that
you
should
have
an
opportunity
at
some
point
in
a
trial
to
challenge
the
reliability
of
the
confession,
to
say
this
is
what
he
said
but
he
was
out
of
his
mind,
it
is
false,
but
that
isn't
your
point
here
and
that
wasn't
the
supreme
court
of
colorado's
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
person
who
voluntarily
went
to
confession
and
was
told,
was
told
that
he
ought
to
confess?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
agree
that
we
really
start
down
a
very,
very
difficult
row
when
we
try
to
inquire
into
the
wellsprings
of
human
action
as
to
what
was
coerced
and
what
was
voluntary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
think
the
admission
of
this
testimony
would
have
violated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
says
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
against
his
will
to
give
testimony
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
pate
against
robinson
involve
the
miranda
warnings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
same
standard
for
ability
to
stand
trial
or
capacity
to
stand
trial
applies
to
the
waiver
of
miranda
warnings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
somewhat
different
standard
applied
in
schneckloth
against
bustamante
for
waivers
of
fourth
amendment
rights?
why
shouldn't
that
apply
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
it
said
it
wasn't
required
in
the
case
of
a
consent
to
search.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
that...
why
shouldn't
that
standard
be
carried
over
to
miranda
waivers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
open
to
a
defendant
who
has
received
miranda
warnings,
you
know,
chapter
and
verse,
to
say,
you
know,
i
had
an
iq
of
95,
and
i
was
very
badly
disturbed
when
i
was
in
the
police
station,
i
just
didn't
understand
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
the
giving
of
miranda
warnings
can
never
conclude
a
case.
it
is
always
a
question
of
whether
the
defendant
understood
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
van
cleave.
do
you
have
anything
more,
mr.
coats?
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coats.
the
case
is
submitted.
