justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
coats,
may
i
interrupt
just
a
second
to
get
one
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
officer
take
the
defendant
into
custody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
was
custody,
or
do
you
take
the
position
it
was
not
custody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
at
the
time
he
gave
the
miranda
warnings
or
right
before
he
gave
the
miranda
warning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you
have
one
statement
volunteered
before
custody,
"i
killed
someone",
and
then
you
have
miranda
warnings,
and
then
some
other
statements
after
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
may
possibly
at
least
present
different
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
coats,
may
i
just
so
i
can
follow
your
argument,
are
you
addressing
yourself
now
just
to
the
first
question
whether
the
initial
voluntary
statement
is
admissible
or
are
you
treating
it
as
though
the
statements
that
followed
the
miranda
warnings
and
the
custody
are
to
be
treated
all
by
the
same
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
the
first--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
coats,
now
we
are
on
the
second
question.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
if
i
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
trial
court
as
i
understand
it
found
that
the
defendant
did
not
knowingly,
intelligently,
and
voluntarily
waive
his
miranda
rights
because
he
was
mentally
incompetent
at
the
time.
are
you
asking
us
to
set
aside
that
finding
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
is
at
issue
on
the
second
question,
is
whether
we
agree
with
the
finding
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
finding
of
fact
was
approved
by
the
colorado
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
he
did
squarely
find
that
he
did
not
knowingly,
intelligently,
and
voluntarily
waive
his
miranda
rights--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
he
was
mentally
incompetent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
was
the
error
of
law
that
the
district
judge
committed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
on
the
first
point.
i
am
talking
about
the
second
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
attach
no
significance
to
the
trial
judge's
words
that
he
did
not
knowingly,
intelligently
as
well
as--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
he
says
it.
that
is
exactly
what
his
words
were.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
the
other
order,
knowingly,
intelligently,
and
voluntarily.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
justice
erickson's
partial
dissent,
i
guess
he
agreed
that
the
procedure...
did
he
agree
with
your
position
on
the
miranda
question
or
just
on
the
first
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pincus,
you
say
the
question
in
this
case.
do
you
agree
there
are
two
separate
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
like
us
to
decide
them
both
on
the
basis
of
the
second.
you
would
like
us
to
decide
them
both
on
the
basis
of
the
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you,
to
follow
up
on
that,
may
i...
supposing
he...
the
defendant
is
given
miranda
warnings
by
a
police
officer,
and
he
doesn't
waive,
then
his
brother
comes
in
and
twists
his
arm
and
said,
by
golly,
you
are
going
to
waive
and
confess,
and
his
brother
forces
him
to
waive
his
rights.
the
police
do
nothing
forcing
him.
what
about
that
case?
would
the
waiver
be
good
or
not?
and
how
is
that
different
from
having
no
voluntariness
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
it
be
good
in
my
hypothetical
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
would
be
good?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
word
"voluntary"
really
means
absence
of
official
compulsion.
that
is
the
only
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
would
be
true
if
the
police
exerted
the
compulsion,
too.
that
is
one
of
the
costs
of
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
quite
peculiar
to
read
miranda
to
exclude
that
class
of
involuntary
confessions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
van
cleave,
when
you
say
he
did
nothing,
he
did
put
cuffs
on
him
and
give
him
miranda
warnings,
didn't
he,
the
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
van
cleave,
isn't
there
another
fact
here?
didn't
the
trial
judge
find
he
was
incompetent
to
stand
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
a
little
different
from
the
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
van
cleave,
what
is
the
status
of
the
proceeding
now?
what
is
the...
is
this
man
on
the
loose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
mean
here,
but
is
he
in
a
mental
hospital
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
hasn't
even
been
a
preliminary
hearing
in
the
case,
has
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
there
has
not
yet
been
a
preliminary
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
asking
you
a
yes
or
no
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
asking
a
yes...
has
there
yet
been
a
probable
cause
hearing?
