mr.
nathan
b.
coats
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
factually
and
procedurally
i
think
this
case
is
very
straightforward,
but
the
facts
of
the
case
are
peculiarly
important
to
the
issues
that
are
posed,
and
we
are
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
colorado
supreme
court
in
a
case
in
which
the
colorado
court
upheld
the
suppression
of
a
murder
confession.
factually,
here
is
what
happened.
the
respondent,
who
is
the
criminal
defendant
in
the
case
below,
came
up
to
a
uniformed
police
officer
in
downtown
denver
in
august
of
1983,
and
he
told
him
that
he
had
killed
someone,
and
he
wanted
to
tell
the
officer
about
it.
the
officer
advised
the
defendant
of
his
miranda
rights,
which
the
defendant
said
he
understood,
and
the
officer
later
testified
that
he
specifically
advised
the
defendant
as
well
that
he
didn't
have
to
talk
to
him,
but
the
defendant
said
it
would
be
all
right,
that
his
conscience
had
been
bothering
him
and
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him.
the
defendant
then
subsequently
told
the
officer
and
other
officers--
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
--yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
he
handcuffed
the
defendant
at
that
time.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
no,
i
believe
that
was
custody,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
it
is
not
entirely
clear,
but
it
was
almost
contemporaneously,
yes.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
yes,
sir.
the
defendant
then
told
that
officer
and
other
officers
after
the
point
of
custody
that
he
had
killed
a
young
indian
girl
named
mary
ann
junta
that
he
had
been
traveling
with
in
november
or
december
of
the
prior
year,
which
would
be
1982,
and
he
told
them
also
that
he
had
killed
her
in
a
particular
location
in
southwest
denver.
the
police
were
able
to
determine
pretty
quickly
that
they...
an
unidentified
female
body
had
been
discovered
in
april
of
1983
and
the
defendant
actually
then
took
a
couple
of
the
officers
out
to
the
scene
of
the
murder,
showed
them
where
he
had
committed
the
murder
and
how
he
had
hidden
the
body
and
covered
it
with
a
mattress.
the
defendant
told
his
public
defender,
members
of
the
public
defender's
staff
shortly
after
that
that
he
had
come
to
denver
from
boston
because
voices
told
him
to
do
that,
so
the
defendant
was
sent
to
the
colorado
state
hospital
for
a
competency
exam.
based
on
the
psychiatric
report,
he
was
found
to
be
incompetent
to
proceed
and
he
remained
at
that
status
for
about
six
months
until
the
same
psychiatrist
filed
a
new
report
saying
that
he
then
considered
the
defendant
competent.
now,
at
that
point
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
all
of
his
statements
and
to
suppress
all
of
the
evidence
derived
from
them
because
his
confession
was
involuntary
and
because
it
was
in
violation
of
miranda.
all
the
facts
that
i
have
already
mentioned
came
out
at
the
suppression
hearing,
but
in
addition
to
those
facts
the
psychiatrist
testified
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
the
defendant
suffered
from
chronic
schizophrenia,
that
he
had
something
which
the
psychiatrist
called
command
auditory
halucinations,
and
that
the
defendant
had
told
him
that
he
had
experienced
the
voice
of
god
telling
him
to
come
back
from
boston
to
denver
and
to
either
confess
or
to
kill
himself.
the
trial
court
granted
the
motion
to
suppress,
but
he
did
so
in
a
way
on
narrow
grounds.
despite
the
fact
that
he
found
that
the
the
police
had
not
done
anything
untoward
or
caused
the
confession,
he
nevertheless
found
that
the
defendant
was
incapable
of
making
a
voluntary
confession
for
the
reason
that
he
felt
compelled
to
follow
the
mandate
of
god,
which
the
court
found
to
be
a
product
of
his
psychosis.
the
colorado
supreme
court
affirmed,
but
in
affirming
it
made
a
slight
refinement
on
the
suppression
order
which
is
very
important
for
the
review
here.
it
upheld
suppression
of
the
initial
confession,
the
initial
statement,
the
one
that
was
unsolicited,
as
involuntary,
as
a
violation
of
the
due
process
old
voluntariness
standard.
however,
it
upheld
suppression
of
all
the
statements
after
that
point
as...
well,
for
the
reason
that
as
a
result
of
the
defendant's
mental
condition
it
felt
that
he
was
incapable
of
making
an
effective
waiver
of
miranda
rights
and
therefore
all
subsequent
statements
were
in
violation
of
miranda.
let
me
add
one
note
about
colorado
procedures
here
that
might
be
helpful
in
explaining
the
nature
of
that
ruling.
in
colorado
and,
as
i
understand,
some
other
jurisdictions
in
the
country,
because
of
the
language
in
miranda
that
says
the
prosecution
will
bear
a
heavy
burden
in
establishing
a
waiver
of
miranda
rights,
the
burden
on
the
people
in
colorado
is
higher
to
establish
a
waiver
of
miranda
rights
than
it
would
be
to
establish
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
itself.
in
colorado
we
use
the
formula
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
to
establish
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession,
but
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
show
an
effective
waiver
of
miranda
rights.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
things
about
these
facts
that
make
this
case,
and
that
make
it
different
from
the
other
cases
that
the
court
has
decided
in
this
area.
the
first
one,
pretty
obviously,
is
the
fact
that
the
initial
confession
was
completely
unsolicited.
the
police
did
not
know
the
defendant
at
all.
they
had
done
nothing
to
him
at
that
point.
let
me
say
quickly
that
the
reason
that
that
is
important,
though,
i
do
not
think
is
because
completely
spontaneous
or
unsolicited
confessions
are
very
prevalent,
and
we
don't
know
what
to
do
with
unsolicited
confessions.
as
was
the
case
here,
and
i
think
would
almost
always
be
the
case,
there
may
be...
even
where
there
is
a
spontaneous
confession
of
this
kind
or
spontaneous
statement,
there
is
going
to
be...
the
significant
material
that
comes
out
will
probably
be
in
response
to
follow-up
question
of
some
kind.
so,
probably
the
complete
absence
of
police
behavior
is
not
the
central
point.
by
the
way,
probably
a
larger
class
of
confessions
that
will
be
affected
very
much
by
what
is
decided
in
this
case
in
the
area
of
statements
made
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
police
practices
probably
would
be
statements
made
to
private
individuals,
and
what
i
am
thinking
of
particularly
are
statements,
statements
made
to
private
individuals
in
which
a
defendant
subsequently
comes
forward
and
asserts
that
he
was
intoxicated,
or
for
some
other
reason
that
he
didn't
voluntarily
make
that
statement
to
a
private
individual
and
at
that
point
seeks
a
jackson
v.
denno
hearing
to
establish
voluntariness.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
colorado
i
don't
believe
has
ever
said
that
there
is
something
separate
about
colorado
law
that
requires
that.
we
have
been
construing
that
language
from
miranda
that
requires
a
heavy...
that
says
the
prosecution
will
bear
a
heavy
burden.
the
effect
of
that--
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
is
anything
in
colorado
law
that
suggests
it
is
based
on
a
separate
state
provisions.
it
is
an
attempt
to
construe
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
miranda.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
i
believe
so.
yes,
sir.
it,
of
course,
has
the
effect
which
sometimes
can
appear
anomalous,
of
requiring
a
higher
standard
to
waive
the
prophylactic
warning
than
to
establish
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
constitution
itself.
the
reason
why
i
think
this...
the
unsolicited
nature
of
the
confession
is
so
important
is
that
unlike
the
other
cases
in
this
area,
in
this
whole
voluntariness
standard
area,
in
which
we
always
have
to
deal
with
the
totality
of
circumstances,
not
having
any
police
action
whatsoever
poses
very
clearly
the
question,
the
issue.
without
regard
to
a
particular
balance
there
is
simply
no
question
here
under
the
due
process
standard
without
some
kind
of
causal
relationship
between
police
action
and
attempting
to
extract--
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
--no,
sir,
i
was
treating
only
the
first
statement
at
this
point.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
first
significant
point
here.
and
i
think
that
is
really
the
significance
of
the
unsolicited
nature
of
the
confession,
is
that
it
poses
a
very
clear
issue
to
be
resolved.
it
gives
the
court
an
opportunity
or
to
take
to,
in
effect,
refine
the
articulation
of
what
we
have
described
as
the
content
of
this
complex
of
values
that
underlies
the
due
process
prohibition.
and
i
think
very
closely
related,
if
not
the
same
question,
is
the
question
about
the
purposes
to
be
served
by
suppressing
confessions
as
involuntary.
i
suppose
the...
i
think
that...
and
really
what
i
meant
to
be
saying
here
is,
think
the
importance
of
that
decision
will
not
only
go
to
the
question
of
unsolicited
confessions,
although
that
is
the
way
it
is
posed
here.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
the...
i
think
you
are
entirely
right,
and
i
don't
think
the
miranda
issue
is--
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
--i
intended
to
be
arguing
the
whole
due
process
voluntariness
standard
with
regard
to
that
first
statement.
i
think
the
first
statement
is...
you
are
entirely
correct.
it
is
purely
a
question
of
fourteenth
amendment.
would
it
be
suppressed
as
involuntary,
apart
from
any
requirement
of
miranda?
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
i
believe
that's
what
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
well,
i
don't
think
miranda
does
apply
specifically
to
that
part,
and
i
think
even
colorado
made
that
distinction
then,
that
the
only
question
there
is
in
some
sense
would
this
violate
fundamental
fairness?
is
it
something
that
we
prohibit
as
a
matter
of
due
process
of
law?
and
then
colorado
made
the
sharp
distinction
and
found
a
violation
of
miranda
for
all
subsequent
statements.
so
i
take
your
point
fully.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
violation
of
fundamental
fairness
there,
and
this
court
very
recently...
and
let
me
say
i
think
in
a
sense
since
colorado
decided
this
case
with
regard
to
the
first
issue,
this
court
in
miller
versus
fenton
has
very
strongly
answered
the
very
question
that
is
before
us.
the
only
difference
is,
it
did
not
actually
have
a
case
or
controversy
dealing
with
this
particular
situation
in
which
there
was
a
confession
without
any
police
participation.
but
in
resolving
the
question
whether
the
old
due
process
standard
is
primarily
a
legal
or
a
factual
question,
i
think
in
miller
versus
fenton
the
court
said,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
very
clearly
that
it
always
involves
a
legal
consideration,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
miller
versus
fenton
the
court
specifically
addressed
those
cases
and
that
theory
relied
on
by
the
colorado
court,
and
rejected
it,
i
think.
it
cited
culumbe
for
that
group
of
cases,
but
it
said
that
although
at
times
in
the
past
the
court
seemed
to
have
talked
about
voluntariness
in
terms
of...
in
terms
of
psychological
fact,
that
nevertheless
always
present,
the
thread
running
through
all
of
those
cases
was
this
uniquely
legal
question,
and
that
the
primary
consideration
there
was
whether
the
police
had
behaved
in
a
way
in
attempting
to
extract
the
confession
that
was
compatible
with
our
system
of
accusatorial
justice,
our
accusatorial
system
of
justice.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
your
honor,
colorado's
theory
was
that
by
using
the
confession
at
trial,
that
was
sufficient
state
action
to
violate
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
may
i
say
very
quickly,
too,
that
they
took
that
from
a
prior
holding
of
the
court
in
which
there
was
a
confession
to
a
private
individual
or
a
statement
to
a
private
individual,
and
colorado
had
previously
held
that
police
action
is
not
at
all
required.
there
need
be
no
police
action
participation
in
extracting
a
confession
at
all
in
order
for
the
due
process
clause
to
apply
and
to
exclude
evidence
as
involuntary.
the
second
thing
that
it
seems
to
me
is
very
important
about
this
case
and
really
sets
up
the
entire
second
half
of
the
problem,
the
miranda
type
problem,
is
the
nature
of
the
defendant's
mental
disorder.
the
psychiatric
testimony
here
was...
it
drew
an
absolutely
clear
distinction
between
what
this
court
has
called
the
two
dimensions
of
the
standard
for
waiver
of
miranda
rights.
and
the
doctor,
the
psychiatrist,
even
the
defense
psychiatrist
said
that
the
defendant's
cognitive
capabilities
were
not
significantly
affected
by
his
mental
disorder,
said
specifically
that
he...
the
doctor
could
not
say
that
he
couldn't
understand
his
miranda
rights.
he
could
understand
his
miranda
rights.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
yes,
sir,
i
am.
i
think--
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
--that
is
what
is
at
issue.
that
is
exactly
what
is
at
issue,
and
i
think--
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
--i
think
what
the
trial
judge...
well,
the
trial
judge
found
that
the...
i
think
it
is
clear
from
his
finding
that
he
found
the
defendant
was
not
capable
of
making
a
voluntary
confession,
and
then
he
said,
then
the
trial
judge
said,
even
it
we
were
to
get
that
far,
it
would
be
impossible
to
show
that
he
made
a
voluntary
waiver
of
miranda
rights
since
he
couldn't
make
a
voluntary
confession.
i
don't
think
he
ever
made
a
finding
that
the
defendant
was
incapable
of
knowing,
with
regard
to
the
second
dimension
involved
in
the
miranda--
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
--yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
well,
that's
right.
he
found
that
as
a
body.
he
didn't
find
that
separately
he
couldn't
know
and
intelligently
waive
his
miranda
rights.
he
with
that
phrase
found
that
the
defendant
could
not
effectively
waive
his
miranda
rights.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
yes,
sir,
that's
right,
and
it
seems
to
me
because
the
second
dimension
here
by
all
of
the
testimony
is
taken
out
of
consideration,
that
is,
the
cognitive
area,
whether
he
knew
his
miranda
rights
which,
by
the
way,
in
moran
versus
burbine,
if
it
had
not
been
clear
before,
i
think
the
court
made
clear
is
all
that
a
defendant
must
know.
those
rights
were
designed
specifically
to
inform
him
what
he
must
know
in
order
to
waive
miranda.
the
only
thing
at
issue
then
is
the
voluntariness
portion,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
poses
a
clear
comparison,
a
requirement
to...
calls
for
an
articulation
of
the
relationship
between
voluntariness
of
the
confession
and
voluntariness
of
the
waiver
of
miranda
rights.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
that's
true.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
that's
entirely
correct.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
yes
sir.
that's
right.
that
is
what
i
meant
to
be
saying.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
he
believed
that
the
notion
of...
that
voluntariness
does
not
require
any
participation
by
the
state
at
all
in
overcoming
the
defendant's
will.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
with
regard
to
the
second
question,
i
believe
that
the
question
is
exactly
the
same.
once
we
have
taken
out
the
second
dimension
of
the
miranda
problem,
once
we
have
taken
out
the
cognitive
area,
which
there
is
no
question
about
here,
and
the
judge
did
not
make
any
findings
with
regard
to,
all
that
is
left
is
the
volitional
element
with
regard
to
waiver,
and
i
believe
the
volitional
element
with
regard
to
waiver
is
identical
to
the
volitional
element
with
regard
to
the
confession
itself.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
i
don't
believe
he
ever
dealt
with
that
separately,
your
honor.
i
think
he
used
the
formula--
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
--i
think
he
said
he
did
not
voluntarily,
knowingly,
and
intelligently
make
a
waiver.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
i
would
like
to
equate
that
with...
for
the
reason
that
he
did
not
voluntarily
make
a
waiver
in
this
case,
from
all
of
his
prior
findings,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
what
the
judge
is
deciding.
i
wonder
if
i
could
reserve--
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
--yes.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
he
only
dissented
on
the
first
issue.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
and
i
may
point
out
as
well
his
theory
was
actually
more
narrow
even
on
the
first
issue.
he
dealt
with
the
question
of
internal
psychological
factors
only
and
didn't
specifically
address
the
question
of
whether
there
had
to
be
police
participation.
thank
you
very
much.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
nathan
b.
coats
one
quick
point,
your
honor.
with
regard
to
competence,
we...
because
there
is
some
kind
of
state
action
required
under
the
old
due
process
voluntariness
standard,
i
don't
think
the
question
of
competence
has
any
bearing
at
all
under
that
standard.
with
regard
to
the
waiver
of
miranda
rights,
though,
the
question
obviously...
competence,
a
finding
of
incompetence
may
very
well
indicate
that
the
defendant
could
not...
knowingly
could
not
satisfy
the
cognitional
dimension,
but
it
does
not
necessarily
do
so,
and
in
fact
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
a
case
in
which
for
different
policy
reasons
a
defendant
might
be
found
incompetent
to
stand
trial,
in
this
case
the
doctor
saying
that
he
could...
was
passing
in
and
out
of
psychoses
and
he
wasn't
sure
that
he
could
consistently
assist
his
counsel
over
a
continuous
period
of
time,
and
yet
at
the
same
time
the
psychiatrist
was
able
to
find
that
his
cognitional
abilities
were
not
at
all
impaired
with
regard
to
this
particular
waiver.
so
finding
that
someone
is
incompetent
to
stand
trial
seems
to
me
to
be
a
different
standard
and
does
not
necessarily
indicate
that
he
could
not
make
a
waiver
of
any
constitutional
right.
i
have
nothing
else,
your
honor,
unless
there
are
any
questions.
