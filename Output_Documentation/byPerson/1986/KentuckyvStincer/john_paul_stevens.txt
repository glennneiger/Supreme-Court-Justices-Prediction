justice
stevens
--mrs.
warren,
may
i
ask
if
you
would
take
the
same
position
if
the
defendant
were
representing
himself?
justice
stevens
no,
i
understand.
but
if
he
had
elected
not
to
have
a
lawyer
then
you
would--
justice
stevens
--agree
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
be
present
during
this--
justice
stevens
--but
as
a
lawyer,
not
as--
--his
right
to
counsel,
yeah.
justice
stevens
--criminal
charge
against
the
parent
of
the
child
for
this
very
thing
we
have
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
but
you
would
say
that
that
parent
could
also
be
excluded
xxx.
justice
stevens
so,
you
would
say
they
would
be
excluded
even
though
it
might
be
quite
likely
that
they
would
have
suggestions
to
make
to
the
lawyer
that
might
help
find
out
whether
the
child
was
accurate
in
what
he
was
saying.
justice
stevens
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
you.
at
the
trial,
under
your
view,
could
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
ask
to
go
over
the
same
ground
that
was
gone
over
in
the
competency
hearing?
ask
the
same
questions.
if
the
answer
is
yes,
then
why
is
it
any
more
burdensome
to
have
it
in
a
ten
minute
session
once
and
an
hour
later,
than
having
an
hour
and
a
ten
minute
session?
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
if
they
had
not
been
excluded
from
the
first
hearing
they
might
not
found
it
necessary
to
ask
them
a
second
time.
justice
stevens
well
of
course,
if
that's
a
concern
you
could
find
a
bigger
room
i
suppose.
i
mean
you
don't
have
to
do
it
in
the
judge's
chambers
if
you--
justice
stevens
--do
you
deny
the
possibility,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
true
in
this
case,
that
the
presence
of
the
adult
defendant
might
enable
the
lawyer
at
the
time
of
the
initial
competency
examination
to
suggest
questions
that
might
be
relevant
and
helpful
to
making
the
right
decision?
justice
stevens
but
you
may
not
know
what
the
child
can
attest
to
until
he's
heard
the
testimony.
he
might
not
know.
the
child
might
tell
some
story
that
the
adult
knows
all
about
and
knows
it's
inaccurate,
or
something.
and
didn't
anticipate
it
coming
up.
justice
stevens
well
then
you
are
saying
there's
just
no
possibility
that
the
adult
could
suggest
any
useful
question.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is,
even
if
it's
highly
prejudicial,
it's
just
too
bad
because
he
has
no
confrontation
right
except
during
the
trial.
that's
what
you're
saying,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
well
wait
a
minute.
i
understand
your
position
on
that
is
we
don't
care
about
prejudice
because
it's
not
part
of
the
trial.
justice
stevens
then
you
just
say
as
a
matter
of
due
process
he
has
to
make
an
affirmative
showing
of
actual
prejudice
in
the
case
in
order
to
prevail.
justice
stevens
i
assume
you're
also
saying
that,
well
i'm
not
sure,
at
least
it's
very
unlikely
that
there
can
be
substantial
prejudice,
if
not
impossible
that
there
can
be
substantial
prejudice
in
as
much
as
he
can
do
the
same
thing
at
trial.
justice
stevens
if
that's
true,
i
don't
know
why
you
even
need
the
lawyer
there.
it
seems
to
me
the
judge
could
call
the
witnesses
in
chambers
and
say
i
think
i'll
just
talk
to
these
young
girls
by
myself
and
make
up
a
preliminary
determination.
justice
stevens
mrs.
warren,
could
i
ask
you
on
another
issue,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
as
i
recall
it
said,
their
section
11
or
article
11
of
your
state
constitution
was
the
basis
for
its
decision
as
well
as
the
sixth
amendment.
and,
has
there
been
decision
in
kentucky
as
to
whether
that
provision
of
the
state
constitution
is
co-extensive
with
the
right
of
confrontation,
because
they
just
rely
on
a
kentucky
case
that
says,
every
phase
of
the
trial,
rather
than--
justice
stevens
--no
difference
between
the
two.
