chief

william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
warren,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mrs.
warren,
you
refer
to
this
as
a
preliminary
hearing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
take
it
from
the
way
you
describe
it.
it
isn't
the
sort
of
preliminary
hearing
that
one
had
in
arizona
xxx
where
it's
to
decide
whether
you
should
be
bound
over
for
trial.
chief
justice
rehnquist
pre-trial.
chief
justice
rehnquist
pre-trial.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it
could
happen
before
the
trial,
it
could
happen
during
the
trial.
the
judge
holds--
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
can
the
first--
--moreover
the
fact,
i'm
sorry.
--kentucky
could
grant
the
right
of
counsel
without
feeling
the
constitution
compelled
it.
just
because
traditionally
when
judges
go
into
chambers
to
talk,
make
some
examination
of
the
case,
they
generally
bring
the
lawyers
with
them.
they
may
not
of
thought
it
through
that
it's
a
constitutional
right
of
xxx.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mrs.
warren,
supposing
that
the
child
was
initially
determined
competent
under
these
kentucky
procedures
and
then
the
same
questions
were
asked
in
open
court
and
the
judge
was
persuaded
to
change
his
mind.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
the
child's
testimony
then
be
stricken
from
the
record?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
warren.
we'll
hear
now
from
you
mr.
posnansky.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
doubt,
mr.
posnansky,
do
you
that
kentucky
could
go
the
way
of
some
other
states
and
not
have
a
preliminary
competency
determination
out
of
the
presence
of
jury?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
your
client's
lawyer
was
allowed
to
question,
too,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
rehnquist
both
lawyers
were.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
what
questions
were
in
fact
asked
at
the
competency
hearing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you're
saying
that
the
defendant
could
have
furnished
valuable
information
to
his
lawyer
in
what,
cross
examining
these
girls
in
their
answers
to
those
questions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
would
that
be
possible?
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
he
was
subject
to
cross
examination
on
his
testimony
before
the
jury,
too.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
fact
that
his
testimony
may
have
been
damaging
doesn't
mean
it
should
be
excluded.
presumably
all
testimony
introduced
by
the
prosecutor,
it's
intended
to
damage.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
posnansky.
mrs.
warren,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
warren.
the
case
is
submitted.
