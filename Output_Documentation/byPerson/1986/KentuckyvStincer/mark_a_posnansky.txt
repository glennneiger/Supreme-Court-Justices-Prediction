mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
though
it
is
not
articulated
specifically
anywhere
in
the
constitution,
the
right
to
be
present
at
ones
own
trial
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
of
all
the
rights
that
we
have
in
our
society.
and
it
has
been
held
to
be
an
implicit
part
of
the
right
of
confrontation
in
the
case
of
illinois
v.
allen.
and,
it
has
been
held
to
be
implicit
in
the
right
of
due
process
in
the
case
of
snyder
v.
massachusetts.
by
excluding
the
defendant
from
this
important,
critical
hearing
which
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
deemed
critical,
this
important
right,
the
right
to
be
present
was
violated,
which
resulted
in
a
denial
of
confrontation,
denial
of
due
process
and
also
a
denial
of
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
this
court
has
held
that
we
must,
at
all
times,
be
alert
to
factors
which
can
undermine
the
fairness
of
the
fact-finding
process.
this
was
brought
out
in
estelle
v.
williams.
in
this
case,
what
was
done
directly
undermined
the
fairness
of
the
fact-finding
process.
that
being
the
fact
of
whether
these
witnesses
were
competent.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
no,
certainly
not.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
your
honor,
the
child,
we
submit,
is
testifying.
and
he
is
testifying
as
to
the
very
critical
factor
in
the
case
and
that
is
whether
this
witness
who
is
making
the
charges
against
the
defendant
is
competent
to
testify.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
well,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
their
decisions
regarding
child
competency
use
the
term
that
when
the
competency
of
an
infant
is
challenged
the
procedure
is
that
the
court
will
conduct,
the
duty
of
the
trial
court
is
to
carefully
examine
the
witness
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
he
or
she
is
sufficiently
intelligent
to
observe,
recollect
and
narrate
the
facts
and
has
the
moral
sense
of
obligation
to
speak
the
truth.
the
court
uses
the
term
"the
witness".
we
submit
that
in
this
situation,
the
judge
is
acting
as
a
trier
of
fact.
and
there
is
a
right
of
confrontation.
this
is
a
witness
who
is
providing
live
testimony,
live
testimony
to
the
trier
of
fact
on
a
very
critical
factor
in
the
case.
i
don't
think
that
this--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--there
isn't
time
to
confront
the
witness.
that
is
the
only
time
to
confront
the
witness
on
the
issue
of
competency.
we
disagree
with
mrs.
warren's
assertion
that
confronting
the
child
in
front
of
the
jury
is
sufficient
in
that
situation.
that's
a
separate
proceeding.
the
competency
proceeding
occurs
once.
the
purpose
of
determining
competency
occurs
one
time
in
front
of
the
trier
of
fact.
at
that
time,
the
issue
is
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony.
not
the
credibility.
credibility
is
in
front
of
the
jury.
before
that
we're
talking
about
admissibility.
that
is
the
only
time
when
the
defendant
has
the
opportunity
to
confront
these
witnesses,
we
submit,
when
the
issue
is
competency.
that
is
the
only
time.
if
it
later
comes
out
that
the
child
appears
to
be
incompetent
the
defendant
would
have
to
make
another
motion
at
that
time.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
he
did
challenge
it.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
but
it,
it
can
be
raised,
your
honor,
but
it's
very
impractical
to
expect
that
in
that
situation,
that
the
judge
is
going
to
declare,
after
a
witness
has
given
live
testimony
in
front
of
the
jury
on
these
very
important,
inflammatory
points,
that
he's
going
to
strike
the
testimony
of
that
witness.
we
submit
that
in
that
situation
and
most
times
a
mistrial
would
be
the
only
possible
relief.
and
it
is
impractical
to
expect
the
judges
are
going
to
do
that.
and
furthermore
it's
not
necessary
that
inconvenience
and
impracticality
occur
if
the
defendant
is
permitted
to
be
present
at
the
competency
hearing.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
i
believe
that
that's
possible
that
they
could
go
that
way.
there
is,
at
the
present
time,
case
law
which
i
have
just
alluded
to
and
that
is
the
procedure
under
kentucky
law.
but,
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
any
bar
to
going,
to
doing
away
with
the
hearing
as
such
as
some
other
states
have
done.
but,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
has
held
that
when
a
state
elects
to
opt
for
a
certain
procedure,
even
though
that
procedure
may
not
be
federally,
constitutionally
required,
that
due
process
applies
under
ebbits
v.
lucy.
this
court
held
even
though
a
state
may
opt
for
a
certain
procedure
that's
not
constitutionally
required
if
they
elect
to
utilize
that
procedure,
which
is
what
kentucky
has
done,
due
process
applies.
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
was
given
the
right
to
question
the
witness,
the
children,
at
the
competency
hearing.
the
prosecutor
was
allowed
to
question
them.
he
was
allowed
to
argue
that
they're
competent.
he
was
allowed
to
help
show
why
they
were
competent.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
yes,
your
honor,
but
without
the
presence--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--without,
right.
but
without
the
presence
of
the
defendant
the
lawyer
was
severely
hampered.
there
was
a
lot
of
things
that
the
defendant
in
that
situation
could
have
done
to
assist
his
counsel.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
he
could,
the
competency
hearing,
your
honor,--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--the
questions
at
the
competency
hearing
on
the
two
little
girls
went
to
only
sunday
school,
do
you
go
to
church,
do
you
believe
in
god,
what
happens
if
you
tell
a
lie,
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
that
is
possible
certainly.
but
also,
he
could
have
suggested--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--if
the
children
were
lying
about
some
of
these
things,
the
defendant
may
very
well
have
been
in
a
position
to
know.
even
if
they
weren't
lying
on
such
things
as
sunday
school
and
teachers,
which
is
unlikely,
the
critical
thing
under
kentucky
law
is
whether
they
are
sufficiently
intelligent
to
observe,
recollect
and
narrate
the
facts
and
have
the
moral
sense
of
obligation
to
tell
the
truth.
two
things
are
important
to
competency
and
the
defendant
is
frequently
in
a
position
to
know
some
facts
directly
relating
to--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--the
facts
of
the
crime
are
admissible
to
get
into
there,
certainly,
because
it
says
that--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--justice
scalia,
in
this
very
case,
the
two
little
girls,
they
didn't
get
into
the
facts,
but
the
little
four
year
old
boy,
they
did,
in
the
competency
hearing.
they
got
into
the
facts
on
him.
and
they
went
into
all
of
this
stuff.
and
he
was
allowed
to
testify
in
front
of
the
jury
and
gave
very
damaging
testimony.
in
fact,
he
even
said
that
his
mother
was
present
when
these
acts
occurred.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
he
was
subject
to
cross-examination
in
front
of
the
jury,
but
as
i
said
the
competency
issue
is
a
separate
proceeding
and
it
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
that's
certainly
correct,
your
honor,
however
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
child's
testimony
was
admissible
to
begin
with.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
the
prosecutor
was
present
at
the
competency
hearing.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
certainly.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
it
was
done
in
front
of
the
judge.
it
was
done--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
in
chambers
or
whether
it's
in
the
court
room--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--it
was
done
by
the
judge
and
the
judge
was--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--correct.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
and
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
justice
o'connor,
i
think
in
this
case
we
have
to
look
to
the
testimony
of
these
children
later
in
front
of
the
jury.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
in
this
case,
just
as
in
any
case,
the
defendant
is
in
a
position,
is
likely
to
be
in
a
position
to
bring
out
certain
facts
to
the
attorney.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
there
was
no
avowal
made
as
to
specific
questions.
but
when
you
look
to
the
testimony
of
the
little
girls,
some
of
the
things
that
were
brought
out
are
so
clearly
indicative
of
a
problem
with
competency.
the
one
little
girl
testified,
the
term
was
used,
the
sexual
term
concerning
the
penis,
and
she
did
not
even
know
what
it
meant.
that
goes
to
competency.
if
the
competency
hearing
had
been
conducted
properly,
the
defendant
could
have
brought
out
facts
which
would
have
shown--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--i
don't
think
in
this
case--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--your
honor,
not
in
a
case
where
it's
involving
the
presence
of
the
defendant.
that
is
a
core
confrontation
violation,
we
submit,
and
there
are
no
cases
holding
that
where
a
person
is
denied
presence--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--i
know
of
no
cases
where
a
due
process
violation
has
occurred
where
a
person
has
been
kept
out
of
the
court
room,
where
witnesses
are
testifying,
where
a
harmless
error
analysis
has
been
made.
i
think
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
in
that
situation
to
require
the
defendant
to
show
on
the
record
precisely
what
he
would
have
done
to
change
the
outcome
of
the
competency
hearing.
some
errors
are
so
clear
and
to
try
to
precisely
point
to
the
prejudice
is
impossible.
in
right
to
presence
cases,
that
is
inherently
a
problem.
we
don't
know
precisely
what
he
would
have
brought
out.
in
terms
of
harmless
error,
we
do
know
that
the
children
showed
very
marginal
competency
later
when
they
testified
in
front
of
the
jury.
the
basic
unfairness
of
the
whole
procedure
was
that
this
man
was
denied
confrontation
at
the
competency
hearing
and
he
was
later
given
an
inadequate
opportunity
in
front
of
the
jury.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
i
believe
that
the
proper
standard
should
be
the
same
standard
as
it
is
under
illinois
v
allen.
i
think
that
if
the
court
can
show
a
specific
objective
factor,
that
the
defendant
has
done
something,
and
i
am
not
referring
to
the
fact
that
he
has
been
charged,
because
there
is
still
a
presumption
of
innocence
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
defendant,
but
if
there
can
be
shown
evidence
that
he
has
affirmatively
done
something
to
intimidate
the
children,
to
scare
them,
to
threaten
them,--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--in
that
situation,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
alternative
remedies
available
short
of
absolutely
barring
the
defendant.
i
don't
believe
that
simply
because
the
children
would
be
afraid,
the
defendant
could
be
totally
excluded.
that's
why
we
now
have
statutes
such
as
the
closed
circuit
television,
which
we
have
in
kentucky.
i
disagree
with
mrs.
warren.
there
is
nothing
in
that
statute
to
indicate
that
it
would
not
apply
to
this
situation.
the
closed
circuit
television
has
been
upheld;
the
constitutionality
of
that
has
been
upheld
in
kentucky.
there
are
other
alternatives
available
short
of
totally
excluding
the
defendant.
the
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
amicus
brief,
talks
about
some
of
the
alternatives:
a
mirror,
closed
circuit
television,
an
intercom
system.
what
is
so
fundamental
is
that
the
defendant
have
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
his
attorney.
now,
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
defendant
has
done
something
to
warrant
his
exclusion,
such
as
the
illinois
v
allen
rationale,
then
i
think
he
can
constitutionally
be
excluded.
but
i
think
the
court
should
then
utilize
some
alternative
means,
if
possible,
so
that
he
can
at
least
consult
with
his
attorney
and
know
what
is
going
on
in
that
competency
hearing.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
factual
finding
whatsoever
by
anyone
that
the
defendant
was
going
to
frighten
those
children,
that
they
were
frightened
of
him.
the
judge
merely
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing,
"i
think,
we
have
to
exclude
the
defendant
at
this
point.
"
no
finding
whatsoever
by
the
court.
we
would
submit
that
the
confrontation
clearly
applies
at
the
hearing.
these
are
witnesses
testifying
before
the
trier
of
fact
on
a
critical
phase
of
this
trial.
as
to
the
due
process...
also
i
would
like
to
point
out
again--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--no,
your
honor,
the
judge
is
the
trier
of
fact
as
to
competency.
that
is
very
important.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
not
the
trier
of
fact
as
to
guilt
or
innocence,
but
the
issue
is
competency
and
it
is
a
factual
determination.
the
judge
makes
a
legal
determination
based
on
the
facts.
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
and
the
witnesses
are
giving
factual
answers
to
specific
questions.
from
those
the
judge
determines
whether
they're
competent
and
the
judge
is
the
trier
of
fact
on
the
issue
of
competency,
not
the
jury.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
no,
the
jury
is
not
informed
of
that,
your
honor.
they
merely
testify
in
front
of
the
jury.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
no,
sir.
i
also
want
to
stress
again
that
it
is
no
answer
to
the
problem
that
the
defendant
was
given
the
opportunity
to
cross
examine
the
witnesses
in
front
of
the
jury.
it's
a
separate
proceeding.
competency
goes
to
admissibility
and
in
front
of
the
jury
it
goes
to
credibility.
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
would
hold
that
a
person
could
be
excluded
from
a
suppression
hearing
on
the
issue
of
suppressing
evidence
where
a
live
witness
is
testifying.
that
is
also
in
front
of
the
trier
of
fact,
the
judge.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
well,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
certainly
the
judge
would
have
the
opportunity
at
the
trial
to
excuse
the
witness
then.
but
the
judge
is
still
the
trier
of
fact
as
to
that
issue
and
the
judge--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--yes,
you
have
to
ask
the
judge
to
do
that
at
that
point--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--pardon
me?
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
it
happened
in
this
case
as
to
the
little
boy,
yes
it
did.
but,
the
important
point
on
the
competency
hearing
versus
the
testimony
in
front
of
the
trial
is
that
when
the
jury
is
present
the
testimony
being
given
in
front
of
the
jury
as
to
the
jury
goes
to
credibility.
the
jury
has
no
opportunity
to
exclude
a
witness'
testimony
based
on
competency.
that
is
something
for
the
judge.
furthermore,
i
want
to
point
out,
and
there
have
been
cases
that
have
discussed
this
and
it's
in
the
brief,
that
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
to
expect
the
defendant
to
go
into
these
other
extraneous
facts
in
front
of
the
jury
again.
competency
encompasses
a
whole
range
of
things
such
as:
everything
in
the
child's
background
can
be
related
to
competency,
in
addition
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
and
it
is
impractical
and
it
is
unfair,
we
submit,
to
expect
the
defendant
to
have
to
go
into
it
in
front
of
the
jury
and
he
has
to
do
this
because
he
wasn't
present
at
the
competency
hearing.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
i
believe
that
is
the
federal
practice,
your
honor.
but,
in
this
case
kentucky
has
a
competency
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
determining
competency
and
it
is
at
that
point
that
the
defendant's
constitutional
right
applies,
and
his
due
process
right
applies.
and
at
that
point,
he
has
the
opportunity
to
assist.
and
it
is
a
practical
problem.
it
is
a
major,
practical
problem
to
expect
the
defendant
to
have
to
go
into
that
again
in
front
of
the
jury
and
risk
alienating
the
jury,
which
i
submit
and
there's
case
law
discusses
this,
would
happen
in
most
cases
to
have
to
go
into
these
other
facts
which
are
unrelated
to
the
charge.
certainly
we
also
submit
that
there
is
a
clear
due
process
issue
involved
in
this
case.
under
snyder
v.
massachusetts
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
be
present
wherever
his
presence
bears
a
relation
reasonably
substantial
to
the
fullness
of
his
opportunity
to
defend
against
the
charges.
plainly
in
this
case,
as
i've
mentioned,
the
defendant
is
frequently
the
person,
the
only
person
who
knows
things
about
the
child's
background.
kentucky
has
a
two
part
test
for
competency,
the
intelligence
to
observe,
recollect
and
narrate
the
facts.
all
kind
of
factors
can
go
toward
the
intelligence
of
the
child,
toward
the
ability
to
remember
and
recollect
the
facts.
there
may
be
specific
instances
in
the
child's
background
which
the
defendant
is
aware
of
which
directly
show
that
he
doesn't
have
the
ability
to
recollect
the
facts
or
the
answers
he's
giving
at
the
competency
hearing
are
not
true.
the
other
part
of
the
test
concerns
the
ability
to,
the
sacred
obligation
to
tell
the
truth.
if
the
defendant
is
aware
of
many
instances
in
the
background
of
the
child
where
he
has
repeatedly
exhibited
a
pattern
of
untruthfulness
it's
very
possible
to
show
that
he
really
doesn't
understand
the
difference
between
truth
and
falsity.
these
are
specific
things
the
defendant
can
do
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
a
case
such
as
this,
in
most
cases
of
this
type,
child
sex
abuse
cases,
the
defendant
is
well-acquainted
with
the
family
and
the
victims
as
he
was
in
this
case
and
he
is
in
the
position
to
know
these
facts.
counsel
is
not
in
the
position
to
know
them.
we
can't
expect
the
prosecutor
to
bring
out
these
kind
of
things.
it's
the
defendant
and
only
the
defendant
who
is
in
a
position
to
know
these
things
and
the
only
way
for
him
to
be
able
to
assist
at
the
level
of
competency
is
to
bring
these,
is
for
him
to
be
present
at
the
competency
hearing
and
for
him
to
have
the
opportunity
to
consult
with
counsel.
i've
also
raised
the
issue
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
the
brief.
we
would
submit
that
plainly
the
action
of
the
court
in
excluding
the
defendant
also
relates
to
the
issue
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
this
court
has
held
that
any
time
a
procedure
of
the
court
which
interferes
in
certain
ways
with
the
ability
of
counsel
to
make
independent
decisions
about
how
to
conduct
the
defense,
when
that
occurs
a
violation
of
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
has
taken
place
under
strickland
v.
washington.
that's
precisely
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
action
of
the
trial
court
resulted
in
an
ability
on
the
part
of
defense
counsel
to
make
independent
decisions
concerning
cross
examination
and
concerning
lines
of
inquiry
at
the
competency
hearing.
this
is
like
the
geders
v.
united
states
case
out
of
this
court
which
limited
the
access
of
the
attorney
to
the
defendant.
in
this
case
their
limiting
the
access
of
the
attorney
to
the
defendant
again.
and
they're
making
it,
we
submit,
impractically
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
the
counsel
to
do
their
job
under
that
situation.
as
to
the
issue
of
harmless
error,
we
submit
that
this
type
of
violation
should
not
be
subject
to
a
harmless
error
analysis.
this
represents
a
core
confrontation
violation.
this
is
not
like
snyder
v.
massachusetts.
it's
not
like
other
cases
which
don't
involve
live
witnesses.
snyder
v.
massachusetts
involved
a
jury
view.
this
is
live
witnesses
testifying
before
the
trier
of
fact
and
it's
an
impractical
if
not
impossible
standard
to
be
able
to
specifically
show
the
prejudice.
but
this
court
has
never
held
where
a
person
has
been
excluded,
where
live
testimony
has
been
given,
that
they
need
to
show
precisely
the
prejudice.
the
prejudice
is
clear
in
this
case
and
it's
even
more
clear
when
you
consider
the
very
marginal
competency
level
of
these
witnesses
that
they
later
demonstrated
at
trial.
it's
just
basically
unfair
in
this
case
for
the
defendant
to
have
been
excluded
from
the
competency
hearing
and
then
not
accorded
the
opportunity
for
effective
cross
examination
because
the
witnesses
may
very
well
have
been
incompetent
when
they
testified
in
front
of
the
jury.
furthermore,
as
to
the
issue
of
harmless
error,
in
russia
v.
spain,
this
court
held
that
the
error
was
harmless,
was
subject
to
a
harmless
error
analysis.
but
again,
that
did
not
concern
the
defendant
being
absent
during
the
testimony
of
live
witnesses.
that
only
concerned
an
ex
parte
communication
between
a
judge
and
a
juror
regarding
a
fear
the
juror
had
as
to
one
of
the
witnesses
in
the
case.
there
are
no
cases,
i
submit,
where
this
court
has
held
it's
harmless
error
to
exclude
the
defendant
where
live
testimony
is
being
given.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
a
trier
of
fact
in
that
situation.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
strenuously
urge,
in
fact,
implore
this
court
not
to
substantially
weaken
both
the
confrontation
and
the
due
process
clauses
by
holding
that
the
defendant
can
be
excluded
without
any
showing
of
cause
from
a
procedure
where
witnesses
are
testifying
before
the
trier
of
fact.
to
do
so
would
be
to
do
great
harm
to
one
of
the
most
precious
of
our
rights
and
that
is
the
right
to
be
present
when
one's
liberty
is
being
decided.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
that's
correct,
your
honor,
we'll
take
the
same
position,
where
the
trier
of
fact.
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
as
to
that
issue.
the
crime
that
was
charged
in
this
case
was
unquestionably
a
most
heinous
crime,
a
reprehensible
crime
and
i
don't
want
to
minimize
that
in
any
respect.
but,
the
right
to
be
present
at
one's
own
trial
is
a
right
that
is
given
to
both
the
guilty
and
to
the
innocent.
and,
while
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
issue,
the
issue
of
child
sex
abuse,
is
a
most
serious
issue
facing
us
today,
there
is
also
no
doubt--
mr.
mark
a.
posnansky
--it
is
broader;
due
process
is
certainly
involved.
the
due
process
right
goes
to
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
contribute
to
his
own
defense
as
opposed
to
just
confront
the
witnesses.
to
contribute,
to
suggest
lines
of
inquiry
to
his
attorney,
to
substantially
and
meaningfully
contribute
to
his
own
defense.
things
that
he
can
personally
do.
and
it's
also
clearly
involved
in
that
right
as
well.
there
were
alternative
methods
and
there
are
alternative
methods
available
short
of
simply
excluding
the
defendant
from
being
present
and
there
was
no
showing
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
was
a
threat
to
these
children
or
that
the
children
perceived
him
to
be
a
threat.
there
are
many
different
things
that
a
court
can
do
if
the
children
are
so
afraid
that
they
can't
testify.
i
do
not
believe
that
by
this
court
holding
that
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
be
present
at
the
competency
hearing
that
it
would
in
any
way
weaken
the
ability
of
the
states
to
prosecute
child
sex
abuse
cases.
we
have
closed
circuit
television
now.
we
can
have
an
intercom
system.
there
are
many
alternatives
available
so
that
the
defendant
can
at
least
assist
his
attorney,
can
at
least
hear
the
testimony
of
the
children,
consult
with
his
attorney
and
have
some
input
into
a
very
critical
phase
of
the
trial
proceedings.
thank
you
very
much.
