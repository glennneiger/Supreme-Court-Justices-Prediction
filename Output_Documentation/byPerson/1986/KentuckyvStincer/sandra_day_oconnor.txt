justice
o'connor
what
about
a
due
process
concern?
do
you
think
that
there
might
be
situations
where
the
proceeding
like
this
might
have
a
substantial
relationship
to
the
opportunity
of
the
defendant
to
be
better
prepared
for
his
defense?
justice
o'connor
and
you
don't
think
that
a
defendant
might
be
in
a
position
to
suggest
appropriate
questions
or
question
certain
responses
with
the
attorney
that
would
be
helpful
even
at
that
qualification
hearing?
justice
o'connor
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
perhaps,
i
mean--
justice
o'connor
--it
might
be
harmless
error.
but,
i'm
worried
about
the
due
process
right
to
be
present.
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
state
used
a
video
tape
for
example
in
these
situations,
do
you
think
the
defendant
would
have
no
right
to
be
in
a
position
to
view
the
video
taping
with
the
lawyer
so
that
he
could
participate.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
if
the
witness
is
found
not
to
be
competent,
the
child
as
a
witness,
then
the
witness
would
not
be
permitted
to
testify
at
trial.
justice
o'connor
so,
it
could
be
quite
critical.
because
the
witness
might
be
the
only
witness
available
to
convict
a
defendant.
justice
o'connor
as
was
the
case
here.
justice
o'connor
well,
take
them
one
at
a
time.
justice
o'connor
i
assume
there
were
three
separate
charges.
justice
o'connor
significant
to
a
defendant,
to
be
able
to
persuade
a
judge
that
a
witness
is
not
competent.
justice
o'connor
so
it's
really
two
separate
questions
we're
dealing
with.
and
it
is
a
rather
critical
stage,
isn't
it,
to
determine
whether
a
witness
is
competent
to
testify?
justice
o'connor
yes,
i've
read
it
and
i
just
don't
understand
how
the
presence
of
your
client
would
have
made
any
difference
in
this
case.
how
was
he
harmed?
justice
o'connor
i
have
a
transcript
now
and
there
are
no
suggested
additions
that
your
client
would
have
made.
there
is
nothing
that
you
have
brought
forward
that
would
indicate
to
me
how
he
could
possibly
have
been
harmed,
even
if
there
was
a
right
to
his
presence.
justice
o'connor
but
your
client
has
not
suggested
a
single
thing
that
he
would
have
done
that
would
have
altered
this
result.
justice
o'connor
don't
you
think
he
has
an
obligation
to
suggest
how
he
might
have
altered
the
outcome
or
how
his
presence
might
have
made
a
difference?
justice
o'connor
what
if
we
think
it
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
violation
and
all
you
are
left
with
is
a
due
process
argument?
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
judge
were
to
determine
that
the
physical
presence
of
the
defendant
would
have
so
frightened
the
children
that
they
would
not
make
proper
responses
and
that
therefore
he
was
to
be
excluded?
does
that
violate
your
client's
constitutional--
justice
o'connor
--what
about
the
question
i
asked?
would
you
answer
that:
if
the
judge
determines
that
the
presence
of
the
defendant
would
so
frighten
the
children
they
would
be
unable
to
give
proper
responses
to
the
questions.
