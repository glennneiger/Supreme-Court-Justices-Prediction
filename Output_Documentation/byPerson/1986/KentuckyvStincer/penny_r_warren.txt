ms.

r.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
from
the
conviction
of
stincer
by
a
jury
for
first
degree
oral
sodomy
of
two
girls
ages
seven
and
eight.
both
girls
and
a
four
year
old
boy
testified
at
trial
in
stincer's
presence.
all
three
described
how
he
blindfolded
them
with
socks
and
said
he
was
feeding
them
a
pickle.
the
question
in
the
case,
whether
he
was
denied
his
right
of
confrontation
arises
from
an
in
chambers
preliminary
hearing
in
which
the
judge
determined
whether
or
not
the
children
were
competent
to
testify.
stincer
asked
to
personally
attend
that
hearing.
his
request
was
denied.
but
counsel
was
present.
on
appeal,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
held
that
stincer
had
an
absolute
right
to
be
present
at
the
competency
hearing.
from
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
section
11,
of
the
kentucky
constitution
confrontation
clauses.
this
court
granted
kentucky's
request
for
review.
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
court
erroneously
extended
the
right
of
confrontation
in
the
sixth
amendment
to
a
non-adversarial
preliminary
hearing
and
that
stincer
fails
to
meet
the
threshold
requirements
of
due
process
for
a
right
of
presence
under
that
clause.
we
also
believe
that
the
state
court
erred
by
refusing
to
consider
whether
the
alleged
claims
were
harmless.
it's
first
necessary
to
consider
the
nature
of
a
competency
hearing
in
kentucky
and
in
most
other
jurisdictions.
at
this
competency
exam
of
the
two
girls
that
is
in
issue,
it's
a
very
limited
hearing
with
a
very
limited
purpose.
there
are
no
facts
of
the
case
discussed.
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
an
issue.
there
are
only
a
dozen
or
so
general
questions.
how
old
are
you?
where
do
you
live?
where
do
you
go
to
school?
where
do
you
go
to
sunday
school?
do
you
know
your
teacher's
names?
the
test
is
whether
the
children
understand
the
difference
between
a
truth
and
a
lie,
the
obligation
to
tell
the
truth,
and
whether
they
are
sufficiently
intelligent
to
recall
and
relate
past
facts.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
no,
your
honor,
i
meant
preliminary
only
in
that--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--it's
a
threshold,
i'm
sorry
justice
white,
i
didn't
hear
your
comment.
ms.

pre-trial.
respondent
has
challenged
the
term
pre-trial
although
he
used
it
in
describing
it
in
a
state
court,
in
that
the
jury
was
sworn.
but
an
initial
determination,
if
you
will,
of
the
children's
xxx.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
during
trial.
anytime.
it
typically
is
a
couple
of
weeks
before,
a
couple
of
days
before.
in
this
instance
it
was
before
any
evidence
was
received
at
all.
but,
after
the
jury
was
sworn
in
a
short
recess
and
motion
practice
beginning
the
case.
in
the
competency
hearing,
the
children
are
not
witnesses.
they
are
potential
witnesses,
but
if
they're
declared
incompetent,
certainly
they
would
never
be
a
witness.
they're
not
witnesses
in
the
sense
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
confrontation.
nor,
is
their
testimony
against
him,
as
the
confrontation
clause
requires
when
it
begins
to
attach.
the
decision
is
a
very
limited
one
for
the
trial
court.
it
is,
really
a
substitute
for
an
oath,
if
you
will,
for
an
adult.
counsel
was
present
and
in
this
case
allowed
to
question
the
children
after
the
court
concluded
its
questions.
at
trial,
stincer
was
present.
the
children
were
present
when
they
testified.
he
was
able
to
communicate
with
counsel.
the
trial
court
placed
no
restrictions
on
his
opportunity
to
cross
examine.
at
that
point,
his
full
right
of
confrontation
was
satisfied.
when
it
did
attach,
no
new
or
different
information
came
out
at
trial
when
he
was
asking
many
of
the
same
competency
questions.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
your
honor,
if
the
defendant
is
representing
himself,
then
clearly
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
and
there
would
need
to
be
a
balancing
of
interests
and
a
special
showing
of
necessity.
to
preclude
him
at
that
point
would
be
a
violation
of
his
right
to
represent
himself.
but
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case
at
all.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
i
would--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--to
represent
himself
and
that
necessitates
being
present.
certainly.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
correct.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
i'm
following
your
question.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
a
competency
hearing.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that
a
defendant
is
not
permitted
to
attend
a
competency
hearing?
ms.
penny
r.
warren
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
they
were
not
qualified
prior
to
the
hearing.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
say
when
the
child
is
young
enough,
or
when
the
defense
challenges
competency
there
will
be
a
competency
determination
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
so,
unlike
the
federal
rules
there's
not
an
absolute
presumption
of
competency
where
the
child
does
go
into
the
court
room
and
is
challenged
there
for
the
first
time.
the
issue
in
the
competency
hearing
in
kentucky
is
competency,
not
honesty,
not
the
ability
to
retain
composure.
it
is
a
very
limited
issue
of
competency.
it
is
our
position
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
confrontation
does
not
attach
to
this
kind
of
proceeding.
it's--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--in
the
typical
proceeding,
that
should
not
be
the
case.
but,
we
certainly
acknowledge
if
the
proceeding,
let's
say,
were
to
exceed
its
normal
scope
and
it's
an
advantage
of
counsel
being
present.
counsel
can
say,
your
honor,
we
object.
this
is
beginning
to
bear
a
substantial
relation
to
his
opportunity
to
defend
and
he
has
a
right
to
be
here.
in
that
instance,
he
would
have
a
right
of
presence.
we
believe
that
stincer
has
failed
to
meet
that
threshold
requirement
under
due
process--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--your
honor,
the
defendant
might
suggest--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--that's
true.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
remedies
for
that
concern
and
we
acknowledge
that
a
defendant
may
have
certain
facts.
most
of
those
facts,
however,
do
go
to
the
question
of
honesty
rather
than
the
question
of
competency.
just
as
he
could
not
challenge
an
adult,
because
that
adult
had
lied
in
the
past,
or
you
know,
and
preclude
an
adult
from
taking
the
oath,
then
a
child
cannot
be
challenged
on
pure
honesty.
that's
the
question
before
the
trier
of
fact
and
that's
when
his
confrontation
right
fully
protects
him.
if
there
are
questions
that
he
wishes
for
the
court
to
ask,
again,
those
can
be
submitted
to
counsel
in
advance,
if
you
like
qualifying
or
validating
questions.
there
also
are
opportunities
to
move
in
limine
for
the
trial
court
to
ask
only
general
questions
to
which
everyone
would
know
the
answer.
and
some
of
those
kinds
of
questions
were
asked
in
this
case.
do
you
know
who
jesus
is?
ms.
penny
r.
warren
the
video
tape
statute
in
kentucky
applies
to
testimony.
i
think
there's
a
question
of
whether
it
would
apply
to
this
kind
of
proceeding.
then
if
a
video
were
used
certainly
the
concern
of
this
state
of
the
trauma
to
the
child
from
the
defendant's
present
would
be
minimized.
however,
video
taping
is
not
available
throughout
the
state
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
much
less
in
a
number
of
other
jurisdictions.
i
would
also
note
that
to
the
extent
the
argument
is
that
he
may
know
certain
facts
that
he
may
wish
to
raise
and
challenge
the
child's
answers,
that
almost
suggests
a
stranger,
then,
would
have
no
reason
to
be
there.
he
wouldn't
know
those
facts
and
would
not
have
a
right
to
be
present.
we
don't
think
that
xxx.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
right.
our
position
is
that
there
is--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--those
suggestions
can
all
be
made
at
trial
where
honesty
or
credibility
is
an
issue.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
i
said
a
preliminary
consideration.
if
new
or
different
information
were
disclosed
as
in
an
example
where
the
person
knew
certain
facts
then
certainly
the
defendant
can
ask
the
court
to
reconsider
its
decision.
counsel
in
this
particular
case
asked
the
court
to
reconsider
the
competency
determination
on
the
four
year
old
boy.
that
testimony
is
not
reproduced
in
our
appendix,
but
it's
on
page
126
of
the
transcript.
ask
the
court
to
reconsider--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--during
trial,
yes
your
honor.
he
asked
the
court
to
reconsider.
so
that--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--and
the
court
certainly
could
of.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
the
information
that
came
out
at
trial
that
would
suggest
that
that
initial
assessment
was
inaccurate.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
and
they
are
asked.
and
they
were
asked
here.
there's
no
problem
at
all--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--or,
certainly
the
jury
could
reject
that
the
child
is
a
credible
witness
and
could
reject
the
evidence
given
by
the
child.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
the
answer
to
your
first
question
is,
may
they
ask
the
same
questions?
yes
they
may
and
they
did
here.
the
second
question,
what
is
the--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--those
questions
are
typically
asked.
they
were
asked
here
by
the
prosecutor
initially.
just
partly
even
if
for
no
other
reason,
to
calm
the
child
down.
they
are
easy
questions,
you
know,
what
is
your
birth
date?
what
is
your
age?
but
they
are
giving
the
jury
some
indication
of
this
child's
level
of
intelligence.
what
is
the
harm
of
doing
it
twice,
if
i
understand
your
question,
or
of
doing
it
earlier.
the
child
is
going
to
confront
the
defendant
at
trial.
the
evidence
is
that
additional
confrontations,
and
the
greatest
fear
of
a
victim,
and
particularly
a
child
sex
abuse
victim,
is
confronting
that
defendant,
that
additional
confrontations
compound
that
potential
trauma
to
the
child
and
particularly
when
you're
in
the
close
proximity
of
judge's
chambers,
the
defendant
is
sitting
a
few
inches
away,
if
you
will.
there
is
the
judge,
the
prosecutor,
the
defense
attorney,
the
defendant
and
the
court
reporter,
and
one
very
small
child.
the
defendant's
presence
at
that
time--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--that's
right,
your
honor,
but
nonetheless
you
are
requiring
the
child
to
confront
the
defendant
one
more
time.
and
our
question
is,
for
what
purpose,
when
his
rights
are
fully
protected
at
trial.
and
the
due
process
protection
is
certainly
adequate
to
give
him
the
right
to
be
present
if
he
can
show
reasonably
substantial
relation
to
his
defense.
at
trial
the
confrontation
right
attaches.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
your
honor,
certainly
the
presence
of
the
defendant
could
suggest
questions.
the
counsel
himself
could
suggest
questions.
he
could
ask
the
defendant
ahead
of
time,
are
there
questions
that
i
might
need
to
ask?
ms.
penny
r.
warren
your
honor,
again
i
see
the
questioning
going
to
the
issue
of
credibility
or
honesty
rather
than
pure
competency.
the
trial
court
asks
limited,
general
questions
to
establish
minimal
competency
to
testify
at
trial.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
no,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
might
not
be
helpful
to
him
to
be
here.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
right
of
confrontation
does
not
extend
to
that
kind
of
proceeding
unless
he
can
show
a
reasonably
substantial
relationship
to
his
ability
to
defend,
or
that
that
fair
hearing
would
be
thwarted
by
his
presence,
then
due
process
does
not
give
him
a
right
to
be
present.
and
the
concern,
if
this
court--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
any
potential
prejudice,
and
again,
if
he's
able
to
show
prejudice
his
due
process
right
to
presence
is
going
to
get
him
there.
but
any
potential
prejudice
is
obviated
by
his
rights
at
trial.
and
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
confrontation
should
not
attach
until
there
are
witnesses
whose
testimony
against
him--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--right.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
show
reasonably
substantial
relationship
to
his
ability
to
defend.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
right.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
your
honor,
no
one
has
ever
questioned
the
right
of
counsel
at
that
point.
but
i
agree
there
could
be
an
argument.
but,--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--if
counsel
is
there.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
your
honor,
critical
stage
tor
purposes
of
right
to
counsel--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--and
critical
stage
for
purposes
of
confrontation,
critical
stage
for
purposes
of
compulsory
process
all
attach
at
different
times.
and,
as
in
the
wade
lineup
there's
a
right
to
counsel,
but
not
confrontation.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
again,
it
has
not
been
questioned
in
kentucky,
that
counsel
does
have
a
right
to
be
there.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
right.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
it
is
xxx--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--in
this
case
there
were
three
children.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
if
i
might
clarify--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--that's
right
and
there's
been
no
challenge
to
the
third
child
as
to
presence.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
certainly,
your
honor,
there
are
many
important
decisions
made
prior
to
trial
and
after
trial.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
your
honor,
if
the
child
were
incompetent.
and
i
would
think
they
would
never
ever
be
testimony
other
than
the
initial
competency
assessment,
but
if
the
trial
court
were
persuaded
that
she
was
so
incompetent,
certainly
it
would
construe--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--no,
your
honor,
the
trial
court--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--it
is
the
decision
for
the
trial
judge.
but
the
decision
can
be
reconsidered.
the
jury's
question
is
one
of
credibility
of
the
witness.
and
again,
the
honesty.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
it
is
important,
but
no
different
than
many
other
important
decisions,
such
as
the
grand
jury
decision
to
indict,
or
the
witness's
decision
in
a
lineup,
that
this
is
the
person.
that
does
not
necessarily
extend
the
right
of
confrontation
to
this
proceeding.
the
appellate
decision
that
the
conviction
would
be
reversed
also
is
a
very
important
decision
and
outcome
determinative.
but
that
does
not
carry
with
it
the
safeguards
for
an
adversary
proceeding.
this
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding.
counsel
would
like
to
make
it
into
one.
perhaps
even
have
compulsory
process
of
witnesses
and
question
this
child
in
advance.
but
just
as
this
court
said
in
watkins
v.
souders,
that
counsel
has
no
right
through
due
process
to
question
an
identification
witness
prior
to
trial,
and
to
cross
examine
that
identification
witness
on
suggestiveness;
it
is
our
position
that
where
there
is
no
reasonable
relation
to
the
opportunity
to
defend,
there
is
no
right
of
presence
in
these
cases.
should
this
court
decide
that
there
is
a
right
of
presence,
then
of
course,
there
would
be
a
need
to
balance
the
competing
interests
of
the
defendant
and
the
state.
i've
discussed
very
briefly
stincer's
interests.
they
are
primarily
that
incremental
contribution
that
he
might
make
above
and
beyond
that
of
counsel
and
above
and
beyond
that
which
he
might
make
at
trial,
an
incremental
contribution
he
might
make
to
the
reliability
by
being
present
at
the
competency
hearing.
he
says,
you
know,
he
may
know
when
the
child
is
not
telling
the
truth
and
we
appreciate
that.
and,
it
might
be
helpful
to
him,
but
just
as
in
pennsylvania
v.
ritchey,
it
would
have
been
helpful
to
him
to
personally
examine
the
documents
there.
that
does
not
grant
the
right
of
confrontation
or
due
process,
the
right
of
presence.
his
rights
are
protected
at
trial.
the
best
evidence
of
his
lack
of
contribution
is
what
happened
at
trial.
nothing
different
at
all
came
out
and
there
was
never
any
challenge
either
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
or
at
trial
or
on
appeal
as
to
the
competency
of
these
two
witnesses.
in
terms
of
kentucky's
interest
it
is
to
provide
that
maximum
possible
psychological
shelter
for
a
child
victim
consistent
with
the
constitution.
and
again,
we
are
concerned
with
the
protection
of
defendant's
rights.
the
nature
of
the
crime,
typically
a
trusted
adult,
there
are
often
threats.
the
greatest
fear
of
the
child
is
facing
the
abuser
again.
common
sense
tells
us
that
child
will
be
frightened.
and
each
additional
confrontation
will
frighten
that
child
more.
it
is
our
position
that
how
the
child
is
treated
initially
may
well
affect
the
outcome.
in
this
case,
the
first
child
as
she
went
into
the
competency
hearing
and
defendant
was
excluded,
after
a
few
question
said,
i'm
not
afraid
anymore.
me
and
my
sister
were
afraid
about
who
would
come
up
here,
but
i'm
not
afraid
anymore.
the
child
was
in
an
atmosphere
in
which
she
wasn't
confronted
by
the
defendant
and
began
to
calm
down.
then
later
during
the
trial,
potentially
because
of
many
reasons
she
again
said
she
was
scared.
she
was
scared
of
everyone
there.
if
you
will,
this
is
a
narrowly
tailored
and
a
well
calculated
procedure
to
minimize
the
damage
to
the
child
while
fully
preserving
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
and
we--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--certainly
our
legislature
and
our
courts
have
not
adopted
a
xxx--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--i
believe
the
majority
do.
i
do
know
about
20
states
have
adopted
the
federal
rule
where
the
child
simply
appears
at
trial
and
is
there
questioned.
the
majority
of
states
i
believe
do
pre-trial.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
your
honor,
there
was
a
decision
within
three
weeks
of
this
case,
commonwealth
v.
willis,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
very
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
the
right
of
confrontation
under
the
kentucky
constitution
is
more
strict
than
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
court
rejected
that
claim
and
said
they
are
basically
the
same.
there
is
no
authority
for
holding
the
kentucky
constitution
is
more
strict.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
so
they
are
construed
identically.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
confrontation
does
not
extend
to
a
non-adversarial
proceeding
such
as
this
and
that
stincer
has
failed
to
show
that
he
meets
the
threshold
requirement
to
entitle
him
to
a
due
process
right
of
presence.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
your
honor,
one
very
brief
clarification.
in
terms
of
the
facts
of
the
case
being
explored
in
a
competency
hearing,
at
page
86
of
the
joint
appendix
in
the
opinion
in
this
case,
justice
stevenson
chastises
the
circuit
court
for
going
into
the
facts
of
the
case
and
we
believe
that
message
is
very
clear.
it
will
not
be
done
in
the
future.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
kentucky
supreme
court
and
hold
that
neither
stincer's
right
to
be
present
under
due
process,
nor
confrontation
was
denied
in
this
case.
