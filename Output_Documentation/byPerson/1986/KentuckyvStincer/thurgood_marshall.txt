justice
marshall
mrs.
warren,
assuming
that
you
didn't
have
a
separate
hearing
to
qualify
the
witnesses
and
you
did
it
at
the
regular
trial,--
justice
marshall
--you
couldn't
exclude
him
then,
could
you?
justice
marshall
so
if
this
is
merely
for
the
purpose
of
excluding
him,
there
would
be
a
problem
wouldn't
there?
justice
marshall
well,
is
this
always
done
in
kentucky?
justice
marshall
no.
that
you
always
qualify
witnesses
before
the
hearing?
justice
marshall
but
there
is
no
law
on
it
at
all,
it's
just
practice?
justice
marshall
but
counsel,
isn't
the
real
trouble,
the
prosecutor
could
ask
him
any
question
he
wanted
to
while
talking
to
him.
to
probably,
your
point,
i
would
think
would
be
that
you
object
to
it
being
held
in
the
court
before
a
judge.
or,
are
you
saying
that
the
prosecutor
couldn't
talk
to
the
witness?
justice
marshall
but
couldn't
the
prosecutor
of
held
a
competency
hearing
in
his
own
office
and
talked
to
the
person?
justice
marshall
so,
your
objection
was
that
it
was
done
in
the
court
room.
justice
marshall
that's
your
only
complaint.
justice
marshall
it
was
done
by
the
judge.
justice
marshall
a
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
justice
marshall
well
that's
xxx--
justice
marshall
--prosecutor
is
doing
this.
he
can
ask
the
witness
anything.
the
only
person
who
can't
ask
him
is
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
posnansky,
how
was
your
client
actually
harmed
in
this
case?
i
haven't
seen
any
hint
or
suggestion
yet
of
what
would
have
been
done
differently
had
your
client
been
present
at
the
competency
hearing.
justice
marshall
does
the
jury
know
about
this?
justice
marshall
did
the
jury
know
that
they
had
been
found
competent?
justice
marshall
but
they
don't
know
anything
about
that
other
hearing?
justice
marshall
just
don't
make
such
broad
sweeping
statements.
