justice

your
rule
doesn't
apply
just
to
strangers.
it
would
apply,
say
it
was
a
custody
case
or
something
where
it
was
a
minor
child
was
going
to
testify
and
one
of
the
parents
wanted
to
be
present.
you
could
exclude
the
parent,
i
suppose.
or
maybe
it
wouldn't
be,
i've
got
a
civil
example,
but
say
it
was
a--
justice
scalia
is
competency
also
at
issue
in
the
trial.
could
counsel
for
the
defendant,
or
the
defendant
himself,
challenge
the
competency
even
though
the
court
had
allowed
the
child
to
testify?
justice
scalia
would
counsel
necessarily
be
permitted
to
ask
competency
type
questions
at
trial?
justice
scalia
because
the
jury
has
to
make
it's
own
assessment
of
competency
as
well.
i
gather
the
judge's
is
just
a
threshold
determination,
right?
close
enough
to
get
to
the
jury,
but
the
jury
could
reject
the
child's
testimony
in
its
view
as
coming
from
an
incompetent
child.
justice
scalia
if
what
you've
told
us
is
true.
that
you
could
repeat
the
same
process--
justice
scalia
--at
trial,
it's
very
difficult
to
imagine
how
there
could
be
substantial
prejudice.
justice
scalia
but
if
there
is
a
right
of
counsel--
justice
scalia
--if
there's
a
right
of
counsel
it's
because
it
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
mrs.
warren,
do
you
know
if
most
states,
you
could
conceivably
do
this
by
dispensing
with
the
preliminary
hearing
entirely
and
just
bringing
the
child
on
at
the
trial
and
conduct
the
competency
inquiry
then.
it
would
make
the
trial
longer
i
suppose.
you
would
assert
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
scalia
what
do
other
states
do?
do
you
have
any
idea
what
the
practice
is
in
other
states?
do
most
of
them
have
such
a
preliminary
hearing
whenever
there
are
juveniles?
justice
scalia
mr.
posnansky,
the
constitutional
right
is
the
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him.
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him
and
i
presume
that
means
to
confront
him
when
they
are
testifying
against
him.
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
he
has
a
right
to
confront
them
whenever
he
wants
to
come
to
their
house
and
confront
them
or
anything.
justice
scalia
when
they
are
testifying
against
him.
and
the
point
made
by
mrs.
warren
is
that
in
this
hearing,
the
child
is
not
testifying
against
your
client.
justice
scalia
not
yet
a
witness.
i
mean,
the
whole
purpose
is
to
determine
whether
this
child
will
be
a
witness.
justice
scalia
the
factor
though
is
whether
the
child
shall
be
or
shall
not
be
a
witness.
and,
if
and
when
it's
determined
that
the
child
shall
be
a
witness,
there
is
time
enough
to
confront
the
witness.
but
up
until
that
point
you
don't
know
that
the
child
is
going
to
be
a
witness
against
your
client.
justice
scalia
counsel
did
that
here.
didn't
counsel
challenge
the
competency
here?
justice
scalia
so
it
can
be
raised
at
the
trial
proceeding.
justice
scalia
they
weren't
asked
about
the
facts
of
the
crime,
and
i
think
they
never
are
in
these
competency
hearings.
they
are
asked,
how
old
are
you,
do
you
know
right
from
wrong,
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
tell
a
lie.
they're
not
asked
about
the
facts
of
the
crime.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
was
it
before
the
trier
of
fact?
i
thought
it
was
a
jury
trial,
wasn't
it?
justice
scalia
not
the
trier
of
fact
on
the
charge?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
you
say
before
the
jury,
it
goes
only
to
credibility;
that's
not
what
i
understood
mrs.
warren
to
say.
i
understood
that
at
the
trial
if
it
should
appear
on
the
basis
of
the
examination
by
counsel
for
the
defendant
that
the
infant
is
not
competent,
at
that
point
the
infant
would
be
excused
and
the
jury
instructed
to
disregard
whatever
testimony
had
preceded.
now,
that
doesn't
go
to
credibility,
that
goes
to
competency.
justice
scalia
to
admissibility,
right?
justice
scalia
and
again,
you
asked
the
judge
to
do
that.
justice
scalia
and
that
happened
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
and
that
happened
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
that's
done
in
a
lot
of
states.
and
i
think
that's
the
federal
practice
too,
isn't
it?
