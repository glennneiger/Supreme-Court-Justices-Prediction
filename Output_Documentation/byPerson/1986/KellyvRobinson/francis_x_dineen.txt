mr.
francis
x.
dineen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
the
state
was
obligated
to
come
into
the
bankruptcy
court
and
file
a
complaint
seeking
a
determination
of
non-dischargeability
of
this
criminal
restitution
order.
and
if
i
may
please,
i
would
just
like
to
address
three
factual
matters
before
i
continue
with
the
argument.
one
is,
there
was
a
statement
made
about
the
amount
of
money
that
was
being
paid
under
the
restitution
order.
the
restitution
order
entered
by
the
court
was
in
the
amount
of
$9,932.95.
that
was
the
precise
amount
of
the
welfare
overpayment
that
was
involved.
although
the
order
did
say
that
it
was
to
be
paid
at
the
rate
of
$100
per
month,
your
honors
will
note
that
in
the
record
on
page
22a
there
is
a
reference
in
the
letter
that
we
received
three
years
after
the
discharge
that
the
state
was
now
seeking
to
collect
from
the
debtor
a
total
at
that
point
of
$9,482.
so
they
were
seeking
really
the
full
amount,
less
the
amount
she
had
paid
up
until
that
time.
and
again,
in
the
record
at
page
44a
you
will
see
in
the
complaint
that
was
filed
against
the
debtor
for
the
revocation
of
the
probation,
again
we
have
a
figure
of
the
balance
owing
at
$9,382.95,
again
seeking
the
full
amount
of
that
restitution
order.
so
it
appears
twice
that
the
state
was
seeking
the
full
amount
as
the
compensation.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
therefore,
i
present
those
facts
to
show
that
this
really
is...
that
simply
illustrates
that
this
was
really
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss,
and
therefore
the
non-dischargeability
section,
523(a)(7),
simply
does
not
apply
because,
one,
it
was
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss;
and
two,
as
has
been
discussed,
even
though
it
had
a
penal
function,
it
would
have
to
have
a
penal
function
for
423(a)(7)
to
apply
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
other
than
restitution,
no.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
if
it
is
not
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture,
then--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--yes.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
restitution,
as
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
i
think
restitution
is.
i
would
say
it's
a
form
of
a
penalty
and
it
does
represent
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss.
our
claim
is
if
restitution
is
not
at
all
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture,
then
the
non-dischargeability
provision
of
423(a)(7)
simply
would
not
apply
at
all.
so
in
order
for
it
to
apply
in
the
first
instance,
we
must
first
determine
is
criminal
restitution
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture.
if
it
is
not,
523(a)(7)
doesn't
apply.
if
it
is,
then
we
look
at
523(a)(7)
and
see
whether
it
applies.
indeed,
523(a)(7)
has
two
exceptions
to
it.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
some
fines.
some
fines,
if
they
are
compensation
for
pecuniary--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--well,
523(a)(7)
doesn't
say
they
are
dischargeable.
it
simply
says
they
are
not
dischargeable
and
they
may
be
non...
they
may
be
non-dischargeable
under
some
other
section.
a
fine
doesn't
become
dischargeable...
is
fact,
523(a)(7)
says
fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures
are
not
going
to
be
discharged.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
unless,
and
one
exception
is
if
they're
payable
for
the
benefit
of
a
private
individual.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
if
it
fit
under
one
of
the
other
exceptions,
that
it
would
be
non-dischargeable.
and
indeed,
in
this
case,
even
though
this
was
a
criminal
restitution
order
which
was
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss
and
therefore
523(a)(7)
did
not
apply,
it
may
well
be,
and
we
essentially
concede,
that
under
some
other
provision
of
523(a)
it
may
still
be
a
non-dischargeable
debt,
because
523(a)(4)
states
explicitly
that
a
debt
for
larceny
is
a
non-dischargeable
debt.
but--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--but
the
creditor
has
to
come
in
under
523(c).
and
indeed,
this
court
made
special
note
of
that
particular
requirement
in
the
case
of
brown
against
felson,
which
i
would
like
to
give
your
honors
the
citation
for,
442
u.s.
127,
a
1979
case
in
which
it
was
held
by
this
court
that
collateral
estoppel
with
respect
to
a
state
court
creditor's
judgment
ought
not
to
apply
in
the
bankruptcy
court...
in
that
case,
it
was
being
sought
to
apply
by
the
debtor
in
an
adversary
proceeding
relating
to
non-dischargeability...
because
the
issues
are
different.
that
is
to
say,
the
creditor's
judgment
was
related
to
a
collection
action
on
the
one
hand
in
the
state
court,
and
the
question
of
whether
the
underlying
transaction
was
one
involving
fraud
was
a
different
kind
of
issue
which
was,
as
this
court
said,
something
that
belonged
within
the
exclusive
province
of
the
bankruptcy
court
as
a
result
of
those
amendments
in
1970
which
required
that
certain
kinds
of
non-dischargeable
debts...
and
those
are
the
ones
under
523(a)(2),
(4),
and
(6)...
although
they're
non-dischargeable,
must
be
brought
into
the
bankruptcy
court
for
a
determination
by
the
bankruptcy
judge
as
to
whether
they
are
dischargeable
or
not
under
the
meaning
of
those
sections
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
then
523(c)
goes
on
to
say,
if
the
creditor
does
not
come
in...
the
language
is
very
clear...
the
debt
shall
be
discharged.
and
that
really
brings
me
to
the
second
factual
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
clear,
and
that
is
in
this
case
both
the
office
of
adult
probation
and
the
department
of
income
maintenance
were
listed
in
the
schedules.
both
were
given
notice
by
the
court
of
the
bankruptcy,
and
indeed
they
had
a
total
of
66
days
under
the
notice
in
which
to
come
in
and
file
their
complaint.
and
in
fact,
they
could
have
asked
for
additional
time
to
come
in
if
they
wished,
but
they
simply
did
not
do
so.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
the
normal
proceeding
is
what
we
call
an
adversary
proceeding.
they
file
a
complaint
and
it
simply
proceeds
in
the
manner
of
a
regular
civil
proceeding,
as
such
proceedings
may
go
in
federal
court.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
in
this
case,
it
would
have
to
prove
that
this
was
a
debt
for
larceny.
that
is
the
language
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
so
they
would
allege
essentially
that.
they
would
say
that
the
taking
was
a
wrongful
taking
at
the
time
of
the
taking
and
that
it
was
with
intent
to
remain--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--this
court
ruled
in
brown
against
felson
that,
although
res
judicata
does
not
apply,
that
collateral
estoppel
may
well
apply
with
respect
to
issues
that
had
been
litigated
in
the
state
court,
with
respect
to
factual
findings
that
had
been
litigated.
so
very
likely
a
good
deal
of
what
had
happened
would
be
admissible,
certainly,
under
the--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--there
are
some,
your
honor--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--your
honor,
i
think
a
good
deal
of
the
restitution
orders
that
would
be
entered
would
fit
within
the
ambit
of
the
various
non-dischargeability
sections
as
they
appear
in
523(a).
that
is
to
say--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--yes,
your
honor.
all
the
fraud,
all
the
false
pretenses,
all
the
false
financial
statements,
all
the
defalcation,
larceny,
embezzlement,
willful
and
malicious
injury
to
person
and
property...
all
of
those
are
non-dischargeable
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
as
well
as
others.
it
may
be
that
in
certain
instances
where
there
would
be
a
restitution
obligation
that
might
be
contemplated
and
a
court
at
that
time
would
say,
well,
this
is
a
kind
that,
if
the
debtor
were
to
file,
this
individual
were
to
file
bankruptcy,
might
be
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy,
and
therefore,
just
like
any
other
creditor
in
considering
whether
to
sue
somebody
or
not,
because
if
i
do
and
i
get
a
judgment
and
i
spend
all
that
time
and
money
and
get
down
to
the
end,
then
they're
going
to
file
bankruptcy.
so
why
should
i
do
it.
those
kinds
of
considerations
that
are
really
considered
on
a
regular
basis
by
creditors
when
they
proceed
would
be
considered
by
a
judge
at
the
time
of
entering
a
sentence,
and
he
might
say:
well
then,
maybe
i
can't
do
it,
maybe
i
ought
not
to
do
it,
and
so
forth.
now,
may
i
just
add
one
thing,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
that,
and
it's
this.
as
this
court
decided
in
the
case
of
beardon
against
georgia,
there
are
people
who
are
poor
and
against
whom
restitution
orders
are
entered,
who
may
be
unable
for
financial
reasons
to
pay
the
restitution
order.
and
as
i
understand
the
ruling
in
beardon
against
georgia,
that
fact
alone
ought
not
to
be
a
basis
for
revoking
their
probation
and
bringing
the
person
back
in
and
re-instituting
the
sentence
and
the
rest.
but
if
a
good
faith
effort
had
been
made
to
work
to
obtain
money
and
so
forth
and
wages
to
pay,
that
ought
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
and
so
there's
a
concern
in
beardon
against
georgia
about
the
poor
person
who
is
unable
to
pay
the
restitution
order,
and
that
really
does
dovetail
into
the
bankruptcy
code,
because
in
the
bankruptcy
code
we
now
have
section
707(b)
that
says
that
a
regular
bankruptcy
may
be
dismissed
by
the
bankruptcy
judge
if
he
finds
that
it
would
create
a
substantial
abuse
of
that
chapter.
and
that
means
that
if
somebody
comes
into
bankruptcy
and
is
able
to
pay
on
their
bills,
but
is
going
to
file
a
bankruptcy
but
has
future
income
and
can
pay,
that
kind
of
a
bankruptcy
is
subject
to
dismissal
under
707(b)
as
a
substantial
abuse
of
that
chapter.
and
if
you
then
were
to
try
and
go
into
chapter
13
and
file
a
wage-earner
plan
under
chapter
13,
that
again
is
subject
to
a
section
1325(b)
which
says
that
that
chapter
13
plan
has
got
to
include
all
of
your
disposable
income
over
the
next
three
years.
so
there's
a
dovetailing
of
these
provisions
that
forces
somebody
who
is
able
to
pay
to
have
to
pay
if
the
debt
fits
within
the
ambit
of
those
that
might
be
a
discharge
debt
in
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
there
was
a
time
gap
between
the
enactment--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--and
the
promulgation
of
the
code,
and
actually
the
code
taking
effect,
too.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
yes,
the
bankruptcy
code
does
establish
a
set
of
priorities,
a
set
of
kinds
of
conduct
that
are
not
going
to
be
discharged.
and
other
kinds
of
indebtedness
obligations
that
are
not
so
enumerated
in
523(a)
will
then
be
discharged.
and
i
think
that
really
represents
a
determination
by
the
congress,
the
elected
representatives
of
all
the
many
states,
that
this
is
the
kind
of
relief
that's
going
to
be
available
in
the
bankruptcy
system.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
reason
why
we
claim
that
this
provision
relates
to
criminal
fines
and
penalties
and
forfeitures,
i've
stated
them
generally
in
the
brief.
that
title
itself,
"fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures.
"
is
lifted
as
a
chapter
heading
in
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
and
clearly
represents
criminal
fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures.
that's
the
precise
term.
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
a
harmony
or
a
balance
in
the
bankruptcy
code
between
what
is
dischargeable
on
the
one
hand
under
523(a),
523(a)
for
example,
and
that
particular
non-dischargeability
section
523(a)(7),
and
on
the
other
hand
what
is
allowed
and
what
is
going
to
be
paid
as
allowed
claims
under
726.
and
726(a)(4)
does
set
up
some
priorities,
and
it
allows
fines
and
penalties
and
forfeitures
now
for
the
first
time
to
participate
in
the
estate
and
to
be
paid.
as
you
may
recall
or
may
know,
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act,
section
57(j)
did
not
allow
penalties
and
forfeitures.
there
were
not--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--that
is
correct,
they
were
not
discharged
nor
were
they
allowed.
and
so
here
we
have
a
major
change.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
you
did
not
have
to
file
a
claim.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that
is
correct.
the
rationale
that
had
developed
was
that
fines
and
penalties
were
not
considered
debts,
and
the
language
that
was
used
in
those
cases
was
because
they
were
not
provable.
debt,
as
you
recall,
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act
had
within
it
in
the
definitional
section
that
it
had
to
be
provably
as
well
as
in
the
discharge
section
saying
that
you
were
discharged
from
your
provable
debts.
so
twice
the
concept
of
provability
appeared
in
the
old
act.
proveability--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--well,
it's
interesting,
your
honor--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--and
as
i
said--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--because
the
congress
made
a
significant
change
both
in
the
definition
of
what
is
a
debt,
what
is
a
claim,
and
the
legislative
history
that
this
court
has
cited
in
the
case
of
ohio
against
kovacs
said
it's
the
broadest
possible
definition.
so
that
all
possible
claims,
all
possible
obligations,
will
be
treated
in
the
bankruptcy
case.
that
is
the
language
in
the
legislative
history
that
this
court
cited
in
ohio
against
kovacs.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
under
the
old
law,
no.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
you're
saying
that
they're
not
dischargeable,
but
on
the
other
hand
you're
allowing
them--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--yes,
i'm
saying
fines
and
penalties
and
forfeitures
are--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--that's
correct.
they
are
non-dischargeable.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
precisely,
your
honor.
they
would
not--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--that's
a
possibility.
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
1973
commission
report,
which
for
the
first
time
in
the
evolution
of
the
bankruptcy
code
talks
about
introducing
this
question
of
whether
fines
and
penalties
ought
to
be
discharged
or
not,
it
says
in
the
legislative
history
there
in
the
1973
commission
report
that
prior
to
this
fines
and
penalties
had
not
been
discharged
because
they
had
not
been
found
to
be
provable.
and
it
says,
it
is
well
settled,
and
they
cite
collier.
and
if
you
look
at
the
collier
sections,
there
are
these
cases,
the
criminal
fines,
the
criminal
penalty
cases.
they're
all
there.
that's
exactly
what
the
commission
report
was
talking
about.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
under
the
old
law,
it
was
not,
it
was
not.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
only
in
the
allowability
section,
57(j),
which
said
penalties
and
forfeitures
were
not
allowed.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
but
in
the
dischargeability,
no,
you
could
not
find
it.
and
what
the
courts
had
developed
was
this
concept
that
they
were
not
provably
therefore,
because
we
had
provability
in
those
days,
they
could
not
be
discharged.
if
they're
not
provably
they're
not
dischargeable.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
code
has
abolished
provability
has
enlarged
greatly
the
whole
concept
of
claim
and
debt,
and
has
included
now,
as
the
legislative
history
says,
all
possible
claims
to
come
within
the
bankruptcy
case.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
fines
and
penalties
and
forfeitures
are
now
allowed
and
will
be
paid,
but
they
have
a
reduced
level
of
priority
in
the
code.
but
it
goes
on
to
say,
for
the
first
time
explicitly,
fines
and
penalties
and
forfeitures
now
explicitly
are
non-dischargeable.
but
the
code
makes
two
exceptions
to
that.
one
is
if
they're
payable
to
a
private
individual
and
the
other
one
is
if
they
represent
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss.
those
are
the
exceptions,
which
simply
means
then
that
we
are
thrown
back
on
the
other
non-dischargeability
section
in
523(a).
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
we
have
some
history
about
the
phrase
to
the
extent
that
really
that
language
came
out
of
57(j).
the
language
in
part
came
from
the
commission
report,
which
talks
about
and
makes
it
very
clear
that
certain
kinds
of
fines
are
going
to
be
discharged.
the
commission
report
says
that.
so
there
is
a
blending.
there
is
a
blending
of
the
language
that
came
from
the
1973
commission
report
on
the
one
hand
and
there
is
the
history
that
we
had
under
57(j)
on
the
other
hand,
because
that
said
penalties
and
forfeitures
are
not
allowed
except
as
they
may
be
compensation
for
pecuniary
loss.
in
that
case,
there
were
some
criminal
costs.
there
were
two
cases.
there
was
a
buckingham
trust
case
and
there
was
a
in
re
capanigri
case,
both
of
which
held
that,
although
criminal
fines
would
not
be
allowed
to
participate
in
the
distribution
of
the
estate
in
a
bankruptcy
case,
those
costs
that
were
taxed
represented
pecuniary
loss
to
the...
these
were
fines
and
penalties,
so
that
those
costs
would
be
allowed
and
would
be
paid
out
of
the
estate.
so
that
history
comes
out
of,
to
some
extent,
out
of
57(j).
i
must
say
that
the
old
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
really
all
of
them
up
to
1978
represent
these
situations
of
fines
and
penalties.
criminal
restitution
appears
in
the
moseson
case,
which
is
a
1974
case,
which
is
after
the
commission
report
had
been
prepared.
and
then
there's
another
one,
the
washburn
case,
a
california
case,
1979
case,
which
is
after
the
code
was
enacted.
so
there
had
not
really
developed...
i
don't
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
there
had
developed
a
judicially
created
concept
within
the
meaning
of
midlantic
that
criminal
restitution
orders
are
not
debts.
i
don't
think
that
that
had
developed
as
such.
i
think
the
only
case
that
we
had
on
a
criminal
restitution
order
up
to
1973
was
that
moseson
case,
a
new
york
trial
court
case.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
up
to,
up
to.
the
claim
is
made
that
since
there
was
a
judicially
developed
concept,
that
that
gets
carried
over
into
the
code.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
and
i'm
saying
there
wasn't
any
judicially
developed
concept
in
existence
with
respect
to
criminal
restitution
orders
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
code.
we
only
had
that
one
case.
at
least
that's
the
only
one
that's
cited.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
absolutely.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that
is
correct.
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
that
was
the
basis
on--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--yes,
and
with
respect--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--and
with
respect
to
criminal
fines
and
penalties,
the
code
has
very
explicitly
now
dealt
with
that
in
a
manner
quite
different
from
the
way
it
did
under
the
act.
it
has
now
explicitly
stated
that
fines
and
penalties
and
forfeitures
are
being
dealt
with,
but
they're
being
dealt
with
as:
one,
non-dischargeable
to
the
extent
that
they
are
true
fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures;
and
two,
they're
being
dealt
with
because
they
are
being
allowed
to
participate
in
the
estate.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
of
course.
the
state
has
to
file
a
claim
in
order
to
participate
in
the
distribution
from
the
estate.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
it
is,
because
of
the
history
that
we
have
under
57(j)
and
because
of
the
history,
the
legislative
history
we
have
in
the
1973
commission
report.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
what's
being
talked
about
in
the
references
to
collier's
there
and
in
the
reference
to
fines
and
penalties
being
non-provable
is
these
criminal
fines
and
penalties,
these
very
cases.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
penalties
were
treated
as
penalties.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
because
the
doctrine
that
had
developed
was
this
doctrine
with
respect
to
criminal
fines
and
penalties.
in
the
parker
case,
a
civil
penalty
was
found
to
be
dischargeable.
so
there
was
a
diversity
of
view
with
respect
to
civil
penalties.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
the
debtor
will
remain
on
probation.
the
debtor
is
on
probation,
and
there
are
conditions--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--well--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--it
would
be
our
claim
that
it
could
not
revoke
the
probation
solely
on
the
basis
of
her
refusal
to
pay
after
it
has
been
discharged.
if
they
revoke
the
probation
solely
on
that
basis,
our
claim
would
be
that
that
would
violate
525,
the
anti-discrimination
clause
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
indeed--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--yes,
yes.
that
really
evolves
out
of
the
perez
against
campbell
case,
your
honor,
and
that's
a
provision
in
which
the
congress
has
really
adopted
the
perez
against
campbell
ruling
and
elaborated
and
enlarged
upon
it
and
said
that
a
governmental
unit
cannot
discriminate
in
granting
any
kind
of
benefits
or
whatever
on
the
basis
solely
because
somebody
either
filed
a
bankruptcy
or
discharged
a
debt
in
bankruptcy.
so
525
has
taken
the
perez
against
campbell
ruling
and
really
codified
it
now
into
the
bankruptcy
code
and
enlarged
upon
it.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
it
was
enforceable
in
the
sense
that
the
probation
officer
could,
if
she
wasn't
paying...
and
in
fact,
i
should
point
out
she
wasn't
paying
for
three
years.
we
sent
a
letter--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--oh,
yes,
they
could
have
sued
them...
they
could
have
sued
her
for
the
debt.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
oh,
yes,
there's
no
question.
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
district
court--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--i
believe
that
violates
525
of
the
bankruptcy
code
because--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--well,
we're
not
there
yet,
i
don't
think.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
think
the
judge,
in
the
situation
where
it's
the
kind
of
a
debt,
let's
say,
that
would
not--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--oh,
in
this
kind
of
case
i
don't
think
the
judge
could
make
that
condition,
to
answer
you
very
directly
on
your
question.
but
i
think
in
this
kind
of
a
case
the
judge
wouldn't
need
to,
because
the
judge
would
know
now,
and
everybody
would
know,
that
the
prosecutor
simply
has
to
come
in
and
file
a
complaint
to
determine
non-dischargeability.
but
if
the
judge
wanted
to
as
a
condition
of
the
order
say,
i'm
ordering
you
to
pay
restitution
and
i'm
also
ordering
that
you
not
file
a
bankruptcy,
as
a
condition
of
bankruptcy--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
trying
to
answer
his
honor's
question.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
thank
you,
your
honors.
