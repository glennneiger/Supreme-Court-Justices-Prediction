i'd
like
to
ask,
mr.
schuman,
are
there
same
states
that
do
treat
restitution
orders
as
debts
and
collectable
as
civil
judgments?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
in
the
state
of
connecticut
they're
not
so
treated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
would
the
result
be
in
a
state
where
they
are
treated
as
collectable
civil
judgments,
under
your
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
for
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
law,
do
you
normally
lock
to
the
state
law
to
determine
whether
something
is
a
collectable
debt?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
just...
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
though,
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
it
becomes
a
little
bit
tricky,
because
it
says
a
debt
means
liability
on
a
claim,
and
a
claim
means
a
right
to
payment,
whether
or
not
it's
reduced
to
judgment.
so
in
a
state
that
treats
it
as
a
right
to
payment
on
the
part
of
the
victim,
it
makes
it
more
difficult
to
follow
your
argument,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
any
event,
it
wouldn't
prevent
the
state,
in
your
view,
from
coming
in
and
getting
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
is
a
peculiar
case,
though,
because
here
the
state
was
also
the
victim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
a
criminal
fine
a
debt?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
comment
that
you're
referring
to
in
the
house
report
was
really
made
with
regard
to
the
provision
for
automatic
stays,
where
the
congress
was
saying
that
criminal
proceedings
don't
have
to
be
automatically
stayed.
i
don't
think
that
comment
refers
at
all
to
whether
a
resulting
criminal
fine
is
a
debt.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
do
you
suppose
congress
didn't
say
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
dineen,
if
you're
right,
though,
then
a
good
many
restitution
orders
that
are
typically
entered
all
around
the
country,
as
in
negligent
homicide
cases,
just
wouldn't
qualify
at
all,
would
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
are
many.
and
it
seems
to
me
under
your
view
as
a
practical
matter,
if
you're
right
there
will
be
an
enormous
disincentive
for
any
judge
in
the
country
to
ever
consider
ordering
restitution
instead
of
just
sending
somebody
to
jail,
because
they'll
know
that
there
is
a
complete
incentive
for
someone
who's
struggling
to
meet
restitution
payments
to
just
file
for
bankruptcy.
and
i
can't
believe
that
if
congress
had
thought
about
this
problem
for
one
minute,
that
we
would
have
a
decision
like
we
have
to
review
here.
and
i
think
the
consequences
of
sustaining
your
position
are
absolutely
frightening,
and
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some
of
them
might.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
congress
may
have
had
in
mind
only,
though,
those
obligations
arising
out
of
the
civil
system,
and
perhaps
it
didn't
have
in
mind
at
all
abrogating
existing
systems
of
criminal
law
and
procedures
in
the
various
52
states.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
possible
that
that
second
exception,
not
for
pecuniary
loss,
might
mean
loss
to
the
government
itself,
the
governmental
entity
imposing
the
fine,
and
be
limited
to
that?
do
we
have
enough
history
about
that
phrase
to
know
what
was
intended?
