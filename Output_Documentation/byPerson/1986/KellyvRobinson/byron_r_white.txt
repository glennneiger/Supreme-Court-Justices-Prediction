mr.
schuman,
there's
no
suggestion
in
this
case
that
if
this
restitution
order
or
this
claim
is
discharged,
that
the
state
could
not
say
this
is
a
breach
of
probation
and
put
them
in
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
a
condition
of
his
probation
that
he
not
be...
that
he
make
restitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
maybe
he
can
avoid
some
civil
action
against
him
in
bankruptcy,
but
that's
all
that
the
discharge
does,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
concede
that
the
discharge
of
the
civil
obligation
means
that
the
state
can't
say
he's
breached
his
probation?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
put
him
in
jail
for
claiming
his
discharge
in
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes,
oh,
yes.
but
if
it
is
discharged,
you
say
he's
completely
free
of
his
criminal
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
he
free
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
she
also
free...
does
her
criminal
sentence...
does
her
probation
end?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
condition
that
she
make
restitution
is
just
wiped
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
your
loss
and
this
replaces
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
enough
to
satisfy
(a)(7)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
interesting
that
the
pecuniary
loss
language
appears
in
the
section
with
respect
to
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture.
do
you
know
of
any
fines,
penalties,
or
forfeitures
that
are
actually
compensation
for
pecuniary
loss?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
do
you
think
restitution
is
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
is,
do
you
know
of
any
fines,
penalties,
or
forfeitures
that
are
compensation
for
pecuniary
loss.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
restitution
is
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
you
decided
restitution
is
not
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture,
but
that
there
were
some
fines,
penalties,
or
forfeitures
that
were
compensation
for
pecuniary
loss,
you
would
certainly
conclude
that
congress
intended
some
fines
to
be
dischargeable
if
they
were
compensation
for
pecuniary
loss.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
dischargeable.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
if
it
fit
under
one
of
the
other
exceptions,
so
be
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
creditor
has
to
come
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
not
discharged.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
didn't
have
to
file.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
have
to
file.
you
didn't
have
to
file
a
claim
or
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
weren't
considered
a
debt.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
restitution
have
been
treated
under
the
old
act,
restitution
orders?
they
were
certainly
in
existence
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
a
while
ago
that
a
restitution
order,
a
criminal
restitution
order,
could
very
well
be
considered
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hence,
under
the
old
law
it
shouldn't
have
been
dischargeable,
shouldn't
have
been
provably
wouldn't
have
been
a
debt.
so
how
did
it
suddenly
become
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
non-dischargeability
of
fines
and
forfeitures
under
the
old
law
appear
in
the
non-dischargeability
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it
didn't.
but
it
does
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
have...
to
say
something
is
non-dischargeable,
you're
excluding
those
claims
or
debts
that
are
not
dischargeable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
saying
the
reason
they're
not
dischargeable,
the
reason
you
say
that
they're
not
dischargeable
is
because
they
are
a
claim,
and
you
want
to
exclude
certain
claims
from
dischargeability.
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise
it
wouldn't
be
in
(a)(7).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
non-dischargeability,
so-called,
wasn't
written
into
the
statute,
was
it,
under
the
old
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn't
find
anything
about
fines
and
penalties
in
the
old
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
allowed.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
claims
or
debts
are
still
allowable
or
not
allowable.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
criminal
fines--
justice
byron
r.
white
--were
not
provably
they
weren't
considered
provable
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
say
that
a
criminal
restitution
order
should
be
treated
as
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture,
that
you
would
treat
it
just
like
a
criminal
fine,
a
real
criminal
fine.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
courts
should
have
been
doing
it
that
way
under
the
old
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
if...
only
if
the
state
files
a
claim,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
--xxx
if
this
restitution
order...
do
you
think
this
restitution
order
was
enforceable
in
court
before
bankruptcy?
could
somebody
sue
on
it?
could
somebody
actually
collect
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
but
not
otherwise?
the
person
the
money
went
to,
i
mean--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
the
discharge
certainly
prevents
suing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
should
it
also
prevent
the
state
from
saying,
well
look,
whether
we
can
sue
or
not,
there's
been
a
breach
of
our
condition
and
we're
going
to
put
you
back
in
jail?
why
do
you
think
that
violates
the
bankruptcy
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
anybody
ever
tested
that
out?
