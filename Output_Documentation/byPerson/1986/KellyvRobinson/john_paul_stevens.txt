justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
there
for
just
a
second.
if
you
had
filed
objections,
you
would
have
protected
these
claims
from
being
discharged,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
it
irrational,
if
a
statute
has
time
to
become
known
in
the
legal
community,
why
is
it
irrational
to
have
the
prosecutor
just
recognize
this
is
one
thing
he
has
to
do
in
these
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
difficult?
i
mean,
creditors
always
file
objection.
you're
just
another
creditor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
some
other
case
might
present
your
problem.
but
how
about
a
case
just
like
this
one.
there's
no
problem
on
a
case
like
this,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
probably?
wouldn't
you
certainly?
doesn't
the
statute
expressly...
i
can't
remember
the
section
number...
have
an
express
provision
for
cases
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
the
only
case
we
have
to
decide
today.
it
fits
squarely
within
the
express
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
not
just
the
prosecutor.
you
have
a
probation
department,
there's
a
probation
officer
making
sure
she's
making
her
monthly
payments.
if
she
doesn't
make
the
payments,
presumably
he
follows
up
on
it.
don't
you
have
some
kind
of
a
checkoff
system
on
people
on
probation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
a
person
defaults,
isn't
there
a
follow-up
procedure
that's
set
up?
and
why
is
it
so
hard
to
say
that
they
have
filed
for
bankruptcy
when
you've
got
to
file
a
form
in
the
bankruptcy
court?
i
jut
don't
understand
this
impossibility
argument.
i
presume
you've
got
good
lawyers
in
connecticut.
if
this
case
is
so
important,
why
didn't
you
go
into
bankruptcy
court?
you
say
this
case
is
so
important.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
kind
of
restitution
could
you
have
in
a
negligent
homicide
case?
is
that
a
common
remedy
in
a
death
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
argument
on
this
point
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
judge
at
the
time
he
imposes
sentence,
including
the
restitution
order,
could
make
it
a
condition
of
parole
that
the
defendant
not
file
any
bankruptcy
proceeding
during
the
period
of
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
kind
of
case.
let's
stick
to
this
kind
of
case.
