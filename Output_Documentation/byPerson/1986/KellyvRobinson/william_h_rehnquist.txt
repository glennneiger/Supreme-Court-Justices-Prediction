mr.
schuman,
you
may
start
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
schuman,
you've
certainly
given
us
some
very
good
practical
reasons
why
we
would
want
to
find
in
your
favor.
but
you're
dealing
with
a
very
complicated
bankruptcy
statute,
with
a
very
broad
definition
of
claim,
very
broad
definition
of
debt,
that
made
sweeping
changes
from
what
the
law
was
before
1978.
and
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
devote
some
of
your
discussion
to,
you
know,
why
this
isn't
a
debt
or
a
claim
as
that
term
is
defined
in
the
bankruptcy
statute.
i
asked
you
about
that
initially,
i
think,
and
i
still
have
real
difficulty
understanding
why
this
isn't
a
right
to
payment.
certainly
the
state
has
a
right
to
enforce
the
payment
of
the
restitution
order,
and
i
think
that
argument
falls
awfully
flat,
to
say
that
it
isn't
a
claim
and
isn't
a
debt.
i'm
wondering
why
you
don't
try
to
fit
the
thing
under
the
exception
in
5523(a)(7),
which
as
i
understand
the
code
says...
would
not
require
the
state
to
go
in
and
file
a
claim.
it
would
be
automatically
excluded
under
the
bankruptcy
code
itself
if
the
thing...
if
the
restitution
order
is
considered
a
debt
for
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture,
payable
to
or
for
the
benefit
of
a
governmental
unit.
now,
the
problem
there,
of
course,
is
the
additional
clause
of
"and
is
not
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss.
"
in
this
particular
case
maybe
it's
a
pecuniary
loss
to
the
state,
but
in
most
criminal
cases
it
would
not
be,
would
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schuman.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
dineen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
therefore
it
isn't
a
discharge...
it
is
discharged
regardless
of
523(a)(7)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dineen,
what
sort
of
proceedings
would
have
taken
place
in
the
bankruptcy
court
if
the
state
had
filed
a
proof
of
its
claim
and
made
an
objection?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
the
elements
that
the
state
would
have
to
prove?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
state
court
judgment
be
admissible
or
would
it
be
conclusive
on
those
issues?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
tends
to
support
your
argument
that
fines
and
penalties
are
debts,
because
otherwise
they
wouldn't
be
excepted
from
discharge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
code
doesn't
say
in
so
many
words
that
it's
criminal
fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures.
it
says
fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
it's
possible
to
construe
it
as
meaning
only
civil
fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
were
civil
penalties
provable
under
the
old
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
i
don't
see
why
that
necessarily
proves
your
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
dineen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schuman,
you
have
four
minutes
left.
do
you
have
anything
more
to
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schuman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-1033,
kelly
versus
robinson
will
be
announced
by
justice
powell.
