523(a)(7)
isn't
very
helpful,
arguably
not
helpful
in
this
case,
because
it
is
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
saying
it
wouldn't
fit
here
because
here
it
is
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss,
wouldn't
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
mean
it's
not
compensation
for
actual--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
of
course.
but
every...
that's
the
purpose
of
every
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture.
when
you
use
the
language
(a)(7)
does,
you're
assuming
that
part
of
the
purpose
may
well
be
penal.
but
in
addition
to
the
penalty,
it
can't
be
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss.
if
it's
part
of
each,
it
doesn't
qualify.
i
assume
that's
how
you
read
it.
i
don't
know
how
else
you
can
read
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it
were,
though,
(a)(7)
wouldn't
be
very
useful
in
most
cases
anyway
because...
are
these
restitution
remedies
normally
payable
to
a
governmental
unit?
in
other
states,
are
they
ever
payable
directly
to
the
victim?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dineen,
as
to
those,
as
to
those
restitution
orders
that
the
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
don't
happen
to
provide
for...
and
you
must
admit,
it
seems
to
be
sort
of
haphazard
as
to
whether
they
will
provide
for
them
or
not...
it's
not
only
a
question
of
the
judge
when
entering
such
a
restitution
order
having
to
have
in
mind
what
the
consequences
will
be,
as
you've
describe
them
and
as
any
creditor
must
do,
although
it
seems
strange
to
analogize
a
judge
giving
a
sentence
to
a
creditor.
it
isn't
only
a
matter
of
that.
when
these
provisions
were
enacted,
there
were
presumably
a
number
of
restitution
orders
already
extant,
that
had
already
been
promulgated
by
state
judges.
and
it
seems
to
me
a
very
considerable
step
for
the
federal
government
to
be
saying:
we
are
going
to
set
aside
state
criminal
penalties.
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
having
the
judges
having
to
take
account
of
the
federal
law.
they
would
have
been
setting
aside
state
criminal
penalties
on
the
basis
of,
you
must
admit,
less
than
very
explicit
indication.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
asking
us
to
read
the
statute
to
in
effect
amount
to
the
federal
government
saying:
yes,
there
are
a
lot
of
state
criminal
penalties
out
there,
but
we're
going
to
set
them
aside.
it's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin

xxx
possibilities,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dineen,
are
you
sure...
are
you
entirely
confident
that
you're
not
going
to
win
the
case
and
lose
the
client?
is
it
clear
to
you
that
the
consequence
of
the
discharge
in
bankruptcy
will
not
be
the
ability
of
the
state
to
revoke
the
parcel,
one
of
its
conditions
not
having
been
met,
or
the
probation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
remaining.
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
probation
was
that
the
debtor
pay
these
particular
amounts.
now,
to
be
sure
the
obligation
to
pay
them
has
been
removed
by
the
bankruptcy
act
if
you
win
this
case.
does
that
mean
that
the
state
cannot
revoke
the
probation?
justice
antonin
scalia
since
one
of
its
conditions,
thanks
to
the
supervening
power
of
the
federal
government,
has
not
been
met?
