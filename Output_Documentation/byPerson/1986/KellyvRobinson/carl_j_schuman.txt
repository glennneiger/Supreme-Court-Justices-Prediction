mr.
carl
j.
schuman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
congress
of
the
united
states
intended
to
allow
a
convicted
criminal
sentenced
to
make
restitution
to
escape
punishment
by
filing
a
petition
of
bankruptcy
and
listing
the
restitution
order
as
a
dischargeable
debt.
in
broader
terms,
the
issue
is
whether
congress
intended
the
bankruptcy
process
to
interfere
with
the
orderly
administration
of
criminal
justice.
the
state
of
connecticut,
the
amici
states
supporting
the
state
of
connecticut,
the
amici
state
and
local
organizations,
submit
that
congress
had
no
such
intention.
we
make
this
submission
in
light
of
the
history
and
language
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and
the
public
policy
purposes
behind
it.
in
july
of
1980,
the
respondent,
carolyn
robinson,
pleaded
guilty
to
larceny
in
the
second
degree
as
a
result
of
her
unlawful
receipt
of
$9,932.95
in
welfare
benefits
while
she
was
simultaneously
receiving
social
security
benefits.
she
was
sentenced
to
one
to
three
years
in
prison,
execution
suspended,
placed
on
probation
for
five
years,
and
ordered
to
make
restitution
at
the
rate
of
$100
per
month
over
the
five
year
period.
she
was
to
make
her
first
payment
in
january
of
1981.
in
february
of
1981,
february
5th,
only
20
days
later,
she
filed
a
petition
in
bankruptcy
court.
state
agencies
did
not
file
any
exceptions
to
discharge
and
the
petitioner...
the
respondent
received
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
in
may
of
1981.
the
respondent
filed
an
adversary
complaint
in
bankruptcy
court
to
determine
the
dischargeability
of
the
restitution
obligation
when
in
february
of
1984
state
agencies
took
action
to
revoke
the
respondent's
probation
as
a
result
of
her
failure
to
make
restitution
payments.
the
bankruptcy
and
the
district
courts
held
that
restitution
is
not
a
debt
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and,
in
the
alternative,
that
it
was
excepted
from
discharge.
the
second
circuit,
however,
reversed.
the
second
circuit's
conclusion
is
at
odds
with,
in
the
first
place,
the
judicial
history
predating
the
bankruptcy
code.
this
court
has
followed
the
rule
that
if
congress
intends
to
change
a
judicially
created
concept
it
will
do
so
explicitly.
in
1978,
at
the
time
when
congress
re-enacted
the
bankruptcy
code,
it
had
become
judicially
accepted
that
criminal
monetary
obligations
were
not
debts
subject
to
bankruptcy.
as
early
as
1848,
in
fact,
this
court
summarily
affirmed
a
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
holding
that
a
criminal
contempt
fine
was
not
a
bankruptcy
debt.
subsequent
to
that
decision
and
in
part
relying
on
it,
at
least
six
cases,
both
federal
and
state,
have
held
or
stated
in
clear
terms
that
criminal
monetary
obligations,
including
restitution
were
not
bankruptcy
debts.
now,
contrary
to
the
respondent's
position,
these
decisions
did
not
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
debts
were
provable
or
allowable,
but
rather
stated
quite
clearly
that
criminal
monetary
sanctions
were
not
debts
of
any
sort.
in
1978--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--there
are
some
states,
your
honor,
that
do
treat
restitution
orders
as
collectable
similar
to
civil
judgments.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
the
result
would
be
no
different.
in
both
cases--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--because
in
those
states
in
which
the
states
have
treated
the
restitution
order
as
in
part
collectable
similar
to
a
civil
judgment,
they
have
just
chosen
different
and
perhaps
innovative
ways
of
enforcing
their
criminal
statutes.
in
a
sense,
in
those
states
victims
become
private
attorney
generals
that
enforce
their
criminal
statutes.
i
would
note
that--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--no,
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
debt
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
code
is
a
federal
question.
but
in
interpreting
whether
it
is
a
debt
or
not
i
think
it's
relevant
to
say,
it's
as
a
matter
of
fact
crucial
to
say,
that
a
restitution
order
is
punishment,
not
a
debt.
certainly
the
definition
of
a
debt
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
code
must
be
applied.
but
even
if
you
apply
that
definition
in
those
states
that
force
their
restitution...
or
allow
for
enforcement
of
restitution
by
way
of
a
civil
judgment,
restitution
is
still
not
a
debt.
i'd
like
to
explain
why.
restitution
is
an
integral
part
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
it
allows
judges
the
middle
ground
between
jail
on
the
high
end
and
lesser
forms
of
punishment
on
the
lower.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
well,
even
in
those
cases,
your
honor,
that
conclusion
would
mean
that
the
victim
would
be
the
creditor
in
bankruptcy
court.
i
don't
think
it's
conceivable
to
say
that
congress
intended
that
victims,
who
have
already
suffered
enough
for
their
crimes,
would
have
to
come
into
bankruptcy
court
in
order
to
preserve
a
restitution
order
from
being
discharged.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
well,
if
your
honor
is
suggesting--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--yes,
but
we
would
submit
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
state
is
the
victim
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
outcome.
if
your
honor
is
suggesting
that
the
fact
that
a
victim
may
have
a
right
of
civil
enforcement
in
some
states
creates
a
right
to
payment,
it
would
create
a
right
to
payment
to
the
victim,
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
victims
to
have
to
come
into
bankruptcy
court
in
order
to
preserve
restitution
orders
from
being
dischargeable.
i
would
add
that
under
federal
law
a
fine,
under
the
criminal
fine
enforcement
act,
can
be
enforced
civilly,
under
a
new
1984
federal
statute.
now,
the
fact
that
a
criminal
punishment
can
be
enforced
civilly
does
not
somehow
convert
it
into
an
ordinary
civil
debt,
as
would
a
breach
of
contract.
a
criminal
fine
surely
is
not
a
debt
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
restitution
is
not,
merely
because
states
may
have
chosen
innovative
ways
to
enforce
a
criminal
sanction.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
no,
your
honor.
there
is...
let
me
answer
the
first
question
first.
there
is
perhaps
a
reason
for
that.
i
would
not
feel
any
differently
if
they
had.
the
real
reason,
if
it
is
one,
is
that
this
was
the
first
time
this
issue
had
arisen
in
connecticut
and
state
agencies
were
admittedly
somewhat
confused
on
how
to
handle
it.
but
our
position
is
that
the
state...
the
congress
did
not
intend
prosecutors
to
have
to
file
exceptions
in
bankruptcy
court,
and
so
it
would
make
no
difference
in
our
view
whether
we
thought
we
should
have
or
not.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
the
state
did
not
file
a
proof
of
claim,
your
honor,
no.
we
did
not
file
exceptions,
we
did
not
file
proof
of
claim.
our
position--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--we
concede
that,
your
honor.
if
this
court
concludes
that
the
restitution
obligation
was
discharged,
we
cannot
under
perez
and
the
anti-discrimination
clauses
of
the
bankruptcy
code
then
proceed
to
incarcerate
the
respondent.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
no,
we
believe--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--we
believe
that
if
this
court
finds
that
restitution
was
discharged
that
the
anti-discrimination
clauses
of
the
bankruptcy
code--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
the
civil
obligation
is
discharged.
the
question
is
whether
the
criminal
one
is.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
as
i
understood
your
question,
your
honor,
you
were
assuming--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--we
can't
put
him
in
jail...
we
can
put
him
in
jail
if
this
court
concludes
that
the
restitution
obligation
was
not
discharged.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
no.
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
he's
free...
she
in
this
case
is
free
of
the
obligation
to
make
restitution.
that
is
by
virtue
of
the
anti-discrimination
clauses.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
no,
her
probation
continues.
the
criminal
conviction
remains,
and
she
would
be
subject
to
any
other--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--if
this
court
concludes
that
restitution
is
a
debt,
yes.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
yes,
your
honor.
if
you're
referring
to
the
consequences--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--the
consequences
of
our
failure
to
file
exceptions,
yes,
your
honor.
the
state's
position--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
the
state's
position
is
that
the
notion
that
prosecutors
should
have
to
file
exceptions
in
bankruptcy
court
is
so
irrational
and
leads
to
absurd
results
that
congress
could
not
conceivably
have
intended
it.
this
notion
conflicts
with
fundamental
public
policy.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
in
all
probability
we
would
have
in
this
case.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
because
in
the
next
case
it
will
be
extremely
difficult,
and
in
the
case
after
that
it
will--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--let's
say,
your
honor,
the
next
case
is
a
drunk
driving
case
in
which
restitution
has
been
imposed,
and
which
it
is
on
occasion
in
connecticut.
now,
the
bankruptcy
code
has
an
exception
to
discharge
for
injuries
occurring
as
a
result
of
a
driver
operating
while
legally
intoxicated.
in
connecticut,
however,
in
order
to
be
convicted
of
a
drunk
driving
offense
the
proof
is
only
of
a
person's
operating
under
the
influence
or
operating
with
greater
than.1
percent
alcohol
in
his
blood.
so
if
that
defendant
who
is
sentenced
to
make
restitution
in
that
drunk
driving
case
then
went
into
bankruptcy
court,
the
state
would
then
have
to
in
that
case
present
additional
proof
that
not
only
was
that
person
operating
under
the
influence,
which
the
connecticut
supreme
court
has
said
is
a
different
standard
than
legally
intoxicated;
the
state
would
then
have
to
prove
part
of
its
case
all
over
again.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
well,
ultimately
we
would
probably
win
if
we
filed
an
exception
to
discharge.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
yes,
your
honor.
but
this
case
is
unusual
in
that
it
does
fit
within
the
express
exception.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
well,
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
decision
in
this
case,
if
this
court
concludes
that
restitution
is
a
debt
subject
to
bankruptcy,
will
affect
restitution
in
all
other
cases,
in
which
it
will
be
hard
in
some
cases
and
impossible
in
other
cases
for
state...
for
prosecutors
to
file
exceptions
to
bankruptcy.
i
would
note,
your
honor,
even
in
the
case
like
this
one,
in
which
there
is
a
neatly
fitting
exception
to
discharge,
that
there
are
burdens,
burdens
that
congress
presumably
did
not
intend
to
impose
on
prosecutors.
the
notion
that
several
years
after
the
crime
prosecutors
should
have
to
start
filing
complaints
in
bankruptcy
court
and
participating
as
supplicants
in
a
federal
court--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--certainly.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
again,
your
honor,
in
this
case
i
will
admit
that
state
agencies
were
a
little
perplexed
because
this
was
the
first
time
it
happened.
but
our
position
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
prosecutors
to
have
to
participate
in
bankruptcy,
and
the
reason
is
in
part
in
the
drunk
driving
case
that
i've
explained.
it's
also,
for
example,
in
a
negligent
homicide
case.
if
restitution
is
imposed
in
a
negligent
homicide
case,
there
will
be
no
applicable
exception
to
discharge,
because
the
only
one
that's
close
pertains
to
willful
and
malicious
injury.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
well,
in
connecticut
restitution
has
been
imposed
in
a
negligent
homicide
case
to
pay
the
victim's
funeral
expenses,
for
example.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
now,
take
for
example
a
drug
case.
in
some
cases,
not
in
connecticut
but
in
other
states,
restitution
has
been
imposed
in
a
drug
sale
case
in
order
to
force
the
defender,
the
defendant,
to
pay
the
government
the
costs
of
the
government's
undercover
operations
which
elicited
or
which
brought
out
the
drug
sale.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that's
even
close
to
a
drug
sale.
there
would
be
no
way
that
the
state
or
federal
government,
for
that
matter,
could
file
an
exception
in
bankruptcy
court
in
order
to
prevent
a
criminal
defendant
from
escaping
the
consequences
of
his
crime.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
well,
we
contend,
your
honor,
that
a
restitution
order,
although
it
has
a
compensatory
effect
and
does
constitute
compensation
in
terms
of
its
effect,
in
purpose
does
not
serve
to
compensate
people.
it
serves
to
vindicate
the
societal
interest.
it
is
punishment
in
a
milder
form,
because
it
forces
the
offender
to
confront
the
consequences
of
its
act,
of
his
act,
in
a
way--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--that's
the
effect
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
well,
your
honor,
that
is
an
alternative
argument.
i
must
mention
that.
we
believe
that
523(a)(7)
does
not
primarily
refer
to
criminal
fines
and
penalties.
523(a)(7)
says
that
to
the
extent
a
debt
is
for
a
fine
or
penalty
and
then
goes
on.
it
is
not
a
definitional
section.
the
historical
note
and
the
predecessor
provision
under
the
bankruptcy
act
clearly
state,
or
suggest
at
least,
that
this
is
designed
to
refer
to
civil
fines
and
penalties.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
no.
criminal
fines
would
stand
in
the
same
place
as
criminal
restitution.
it
would
be
outside
of
bankruptcy
completely.
i
think
that
this
is
perhaps
clearest
from
the
history
of
the
cases
predating
the
bankruptcy
code,
because,
as
i've
stated,
these
cases
made
clear
that
criminal
monetary
obligations
were
outside
of
bankruptcy.
now,
in
1978
congress
did
nothing
to
alter
this
settled
view.
it
did
expand
the
concept
of
debt
to
bring
in
matters
that
were
outside
of
bankruptcy
previously
because
they
were
non-provable
or
non-allowable
or
too
contingent
or
unliquidated.
but
it
did
nothing
to
alter
the
fact
that
certain
criminal
obligations
were
outside
of
bankruptcy
for
reasons
unrelated
to
their
speculative
nature.
and
the
fact
that
congress
expanded
the
concept
of
debt
in
some
ways
to
bring
in
non-provable
claims,
but
not
in
other
ways,
is
the
strongest
indication,
or
at
least
a
strong
one,
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
do
so.
the
fact
is,
congress
specifically
stated
that
the
bankruptcy
laws
are
not
designed
to
be
a
haven
for
criminal
offenders,
but
are
designed
to
give
relief
from
financial
overextension.
that
was
the
reason
that
congress
broadened
the
concept
of
debt.
it
was
to
bring
in
speculative
debts.
it
manifested
no
intention
whatsoever
to
change
the
settled
view
of
the
law
whereby--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--well,
your
honor,
the
comment
is
associated
in
the
historical
note,
or
in
the
legislative
history,
with
the
automatic
stay.
but
it
would
make
no
sense
for
congress
to
exempt
criminal
actions
from
an
automatic
stay
and
only
to
then
nullify
in
part
the
result
of
that
criminal
prosecution.
there
was
a
reason
that
congress
made
explicit
the
exception
from
the
automatic
stay
for
criminal
obligations
or
for
criminal
actions,
and
that
was
because
in
the
1970's,
as
this
court
in
midlantic
observed,
courts
had
started
broadening
the
effect
of
the
automatic
stay.
so
congress
thought
it
wise
to
specify
the
exceptions
from
the
automatic
stay,
and
that's
why
it
did
so
with
regard
to
criminal
actions.
but
there
was
no
need
for
congress
to
change
the
settled
view
of
the
law
that
had
kept
criminal
obligations
outside
of
bankruptcy
altogether.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
well,
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
that
might
be
its
effect,
but
it's
not
its
purpose,
and
that
for
the
most
part--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--no,
i
wouldn't.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
well,
for
two
reasons.
one
is
peculiar
to
this
case,
in
that
the
amount
that
the
debtor
had
to
pay
was
less
than
the
amount
of
the
loss.
but
moving
beyond
that--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--well,
it's
certainly
not
full
compensation.
but
moving
beyond...
and
it
suggests
that
the
sentencing
court
had
other
purposes
in
mind
in
compensating
the
state.
restitution
was
designed
to
achieve
punitive
purposes
and
not
compensatory
purposes.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
well,
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
again
restitution
is
not
a
compensatory
device.
it
is
a
punitive
one,
and
for
the
most--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--not
to
my
knowledge.
they're
usually
filtered
through
a
governmental
unit,
dispersed
by
the
governmental
unit.
but
it
might
be
for...
governmental
unit
in
the
bankruptcy
code
is
defined
to
include
the
state
as
a
larger
entity.
so
it
might...
since
restitution
serves
punitive
purposes,
it
might
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
polity
as
a
whole.
i'd
like
to
make
clear,
however,
that
it
appears
from
the
history
of
523(a)(7)
that
it
refers
primarily
to
civil
fines
and
penalties,
and
that
criminal
fines
and
penalties
were
considered
outside
of
bankruptcy
altogether
and
so
there
was
no
need
for...
there
would
be
no
need
for
prosecutors
to
have
to
file
exceptions
to
bankruptcy.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
because,
your
honor,
it
did
not
need
to.
and
the
rule
that
this
court...
and
that
was
true
in
midlantic
as
well,
where
there
was
a
judicial
exception
to
the
trustee's
abandonment
power.
this
court
found
that
congress
did
not
need
to
specify
that
that
exception
would
carry
through,
but
because
it
did
not
manifest
any
intent
to
change
the
prior
history
this
court
presumed
that
the
congress
intended
to
carry
it
through.
and
that's
certainly
the
case
here.
now,
i
would
note,
in
addition
to
the
burdens
that
i've
mentioned
of
filing
exceptions
to
discharge,
this
court
in
imbler
v.
pachtman
clearly
stated
that
a
prosecutor's
energy
and
commitment
should
be
to
prosecuting
criminal
cases.
and
i
think
it
would
be
contrary
to
this
court's
prior
decision
in
imbler
and
the
public
policy
surrounding
it
for
prosecutors
to
start
becoming
bankruptcy
lawyers
and
supplicants
in
bankruptcy
court.
i
think
that
there
are
some
cases
in
which--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--yes,
they
do,
your
honor,
yes.
but
in
connecticut
state
prosecutors
would
have
to
represent
the
division
of
criminal
justice,
and
it
would
be
i
think
contrary
to
notions
of
federalism
and
contrary
to
notions
of
finality
for
prosecutors
to
become
supplicants
in
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
the
question.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
perhaps
in
this
case
no--
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
--no.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
in
other
cases,
the
cost
to
society
will
be
that
a
person
sentenced
to
make
restitution
will
be
able
to
commit
the
perfect
crime.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
carl
j.
schuman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
congress
had
intended
to
work
a
wholesale
change
in
criminal
justice
whereby
large
groups
of
restitution
orders
in
crimes
such
as
negligent
homicide,
drugs,
and,
as
i've
pointed
out,
in
other
crimes,
surely
it
would
have
been
explicit.
it
was
not.
now,
not
only
are
there
large
categories
of
crimes
in
which
restitution
orders
would
be
dischargeable
without
any
remedy
for
the
state,
but
there's
a
category
of
bankruptcy
in
which
a
debtor
could
escape
other
restitution
orders.
if
a
debtor
went
into
chapter
13
instead
of
chapter
7
as
in
this
case,
there
would
probably
be
no
applicable
exception
to
discharge
for
any
sort
of
restitution
order,
because
the
only
exceptions
to
discharge
in
chapter
13
pertain
to
long-term
debts
and
alimony
or
child
support.
there
is
no
larceny
exception
to
discharge
in
chapter
13.
so
if
this
court
rules
that
restitution
is
dischargeable,
then
defendants
ordered
to
pay
restitution
may
just
circumvent
it
by
going
into
chapter
13.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
state
believes
that
its
inability
or
its
possible
inability
to
incarcerate
a
person
who
has...
for
failure
to
pay
restitution
when
the
restitution
has
been
discharged,
if
this
court
so
rules,
is
an
interpretation
of
perez
v.
campbell.
now,
it
may
be
possible
that
what
the
perez
court
really
meant
was
that
the
debtor
in
bankruptcy
gets
a
clean
economic
slate,
but
does
not
get
a
clean
criminal
record
as
a
result
of
a
bankruptcy
discharge.
thank
you
very
much.
