ms.
julie
s.
levin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
missouri
is
violating
a
federal
statute,
26
united
states
code
3304(a)(12)
by
denying
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
women
like
mrs.
wimberly
who
have
left
their
jobs
because
of
their
pregnancy
and
are
then
denied
reinstatement
in
those
jobs
when
they
are
able
to
return
to
work.
the
statute
provides
in
part
that
no
person
shall
be
denied
compensation
under
state
law,
solely
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
or
termination
of
pregnancy.
on
august
23rd,
1980,
mrs.
wimberly,
who
was
then
seven
months
pregnant,
went
to
her
employer
of
three
years,
j.
c.
penney
company,
and
asked
her
supervisor
if
she
could
have
a
maternity
leave
of
absence
because
she
was
physically
unable
to
continue
working.
at
that
time,
her
supervisor
told
her
she
could
have
a
leave
of
absence
but
that
the
policy
of
the
company
was
that
it
did
not
guarantee
the
reinstatement
of
an
employee
in
the
event
that
no
positions
were
available
when
the
employee
was
ready
to
return
to
work.
mrs.
wimberly
took
her
leave
of
absence
and
on
november
5th,
1980,
she
had
her
baby
daughter.
three
and
a
half
weeks
later
she
called
her
supervisor
and
told
her
that
she
was
ready
to
return
to
work.
at
that
time
she
was
told
that,
"there
are
no
jobs
available
and
you'll
have
to
quit.
"
mrs.
wimberly
then
applied
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits
with
the
state
of
missouri
and
a
deputy
for
the
division
of
employment
security
held
that
she
was
disqualified
because
she
quit
because
of
pregnancy,
and
under
missouri
law
that's
deemed
a
voluntary
quit
without
good
cause
attributable
to
the
work
or
the
employer.
after
administrative
appeals
and
lower
court
decisions,
the
missouri
supreme
court
held
that
the
administrative
decision
was
correct
and
that
section
3304(a)(12)
is
merely
an
antidiscrimination
statute
that
requires
pregnancy
to
be
treated
the
same
as
disability,
and
the
pregnancy
cannot
be
disadvantaged.
but,
the
missouri
supreme
court
misinterpreted
the
federal
statute.
it
is
not
just
an
antidiscrimination
statute,
but
rather
it
is
a
broad,
comprehensive
prohibition
of
pregnancy
related
disqualifications
of
eligible
women.
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
and
the
whole
purpose
behind
this
statute
establishes
that
this
was
what
congress
intended.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
provide
economic
security
for
eligible
women
who
were
forced
to
leave
their
jobs
because
of
pregnancy
and
childbirth.
congress
was
aware
of
the
prevalence
of
women
in
the
work
force.
there
are
21
million
women
of
childbearing
age
in
the
work
force.
eighty-five
percent
of
these
women
will
have
at
least
one
child
during
their
working
lives.
congress
was
aware
of
the
tremendous
hardship
that
these
women
and
their
families
suffer
when
the
women
are
denied
reinstatement
in
their
jobs
after
childbirth
and
also
denied
unemployment
compensation.
without
a
source
of
income
to
aid
and
support
themselves
and
their
families
while
they
are
actively
seeking
re-employment,
and
also
to
provide
necessary
expenses
such
as
child
care
cost
and
transportation
to
facilitate
their
re-entry
into
the
work
force,
women
are
at
a
tremendous
disadvantage
in
competing
in
the
employment
process.
congress
recognized
this
problem
and
in
the
interest
of
promoting
childbirth,
protecting
the
economic
security
of
families,
and
also
preventing
family
disintegration
due
to
unemployment
and
lack
of
income,
congress
enacted
the
statute.
the
statute
is
not
an
antidiscrimination
statute.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
yes.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
there
is
no
ruling
on
that,
your
honor.
j.c.
penney
was
named
as
a
party
merely
because
it's
required
by
statute
in
a
petition
for
review
in
an
administrative
case.
but
there
was
no
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
j.c.
penney
had
entertained
discrimination
in
its
policies.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
the
state
court's
rationale
was
that
the
voluntary
quit
statute
in
missouri
is
a
neutral
statute
and
therefore
they
can
use
that
statute
to
disqualify
benefits
to
mrs.
wimberly
and
to
women
who
leave
their
job
because
of
pregnancy,
as
long
as
they
do
the
same
treatment
to
people
who
leave
their
job
because
of
disability.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that's
not
a
matter
of
record,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
have
no
claim
against
j.c.
penney.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
do
we
dispute
that
that's...
do
we
dispute
the
fact,
your
honor?
ms.
julie
s.
levin
it
is
a
fact,
your
honor.
we
don't
dispute
that
they
treat
pregnancy
and
disability
the
same.
both...
if
you
leave
your
job
because
of
pregnancy
or
disability,
you
will
be
denied
unemployment
compensation
because
it
will
be
deemed
a
voluntary
quit
without
good
cause
attributable
to
the
work
or
the
employer.
and,
there
is
no
dispute
on
that,
your
honor.
but
the
language
of
the
statute
is
not--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
statute
congress
addressed
pregnancy.
it
did
not
address
disability.
and
the
language
of
the
statute
is
not
that
of
an
antidiscrimination
statute.
typically,
when
congress
intends
to
enact
an
anti-discrimination
statute,
it
will
use
the
word
"discriminate"
or
a
derivative
of
that
term
to
explicitly
state
its
prohibition.
another
method
that
congress
has
used
to
state
an
antidiscrimination
statute
can
be
found
in
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
where
a
comparison
is
made
of
two
groups
of
people
and
there
is
a
prohibition
that
these
people
be
treated
dissimilarly.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
no,
your
honor,
on
the
contrary.
mrs.
wimberly
is
asserting
that
she
was
only
entitled
to
benefits
when
she
requested
reinstatement
and
was
able
to
work
and
available
for
work.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
the
federal
statute,
your
honor,
only
addresses
pregnancy
disqualification.
it
does
not
address
eligibility.
and
in
the
absence
of
any
statement
concerning
eligibility,
the
state
law
would
apply.
and
as
we
previously
noted
in
missouri,
in
order
to
be
eligible
you
must
be
able
to
work
and
available
for
work.
additionally,
section--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
legislative
history,
additionally,
the
congress
was
very
clear
that
they
only
wanted
eligible
women
to
be
able
to
get
benefits,
that
if
a
woman
was
unable
to
work
or
unavailable
for
work,
she
should
not
be
able
to
get
benefits.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
no,
your
honor,
you're
not...
you're
disqualified
if
you
voluntarily
quit
your
prior
job.
in
the
unemployment
compensation
system
it's
a
three-tiered
test.
the
first
question
is
whether
you
are
an
insured
worker,
you
have
sufficient
wage
credits
and
work
credits.
the
second
question
is,
are
you
eligible;
in
other
words,
are
you
able
to
work
and
available
for
work.
and
then
the
third
question,
even
if
you
are
eligible,
are
you
disqualified
for
a
certain
reason.
you
can
be
disqualified
because
you
voluntarily
quit
your
job
without
good
cause
connected
to
the
employment.
you
can
be
disqualified
for
misconduct
on
the
job.
so,
there
is
a
distinction
there
between
eligibility
and
the
respondents--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--it's
hard
to
attribute...
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
situation
where
the
misconduct
would
be
attributed
to
the
pregnancy.
if
a
pregnant
woman--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--and
therefore
engages
in
some
misconduct
on
the
job?
ms.
julie
s.
levin
typically,
if
someone
is
pregnant
and
she
is
fired
for
misconduct,
it's
not
related
at
all
to
her
pregnancy
and
she
would
not
be
qualified.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
i
think
that
if
she
could--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--i
think
if
she
could
fully
establish
that
the
misconduct
was
directly
attributable
to
her
pregnancy,
then
she
may
be
able
to
be
qualified.
i
don't
think
it's
that
clear.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
disqualification
has
to
be
as
a
result
of
her
pregnancy.
in
other
words,
if
she
leaves
her
job
because
of
pregnancy
or
if
her
unemployment
as
a
result
of
her
pregnancy
and
the
misconduct
situation...
if
she
can
establish
that
her
unemployment
is
a
result
of
her
pregnancy,
then
i
think
she
would
definitely
be
eligible
and
qualified
for
benefits.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
yes,
your
honor.
the
language
of
the
statute
talks
about
the
disqualification
by
the
state
of
the
employee,
but
in
this
situation
mrs.
wimberly
left
her
job
solely
because
of
her
pregnancy.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
state
denied
her
benefits
because
they
deemed
her
leaving
because
of
pregnancy
a
voluntary
quit.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
the
state
had
no
information
that
she
left
because
of
her
pregnancy?
ms.
julie
s.
levin
if
the
state
has
no
information
that
she
left
because
of
her
pregnancy,
i
don't
think
it
would
violate
the
statute.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
well
generally
they're
violating
the
statute
by
automatically
presuming
that
when
you
leave
your
work
because
of
pregnancy
it's
a
voluntary
quit
that's
not
connected
to
the
employment.
and
therefore,
because
they're
making
that
determination,
that
they
are
deeming
any
leaving
or
absence
of
your
job
due
to
pregnancy
as
a
voluntary
quit
without
good
cause
attributable
to
the
work,
that
then
becomes
the
basis
for
the
denial.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it's
also--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--it
isn't
a
category,
but
congress
did
not
intend
for
states
to
use
neutral
statutes
or,
quote,
"neutral"
statutes
to
turn
around
and
do
the
same
prohibited
practices
that
congress
was
abolishing.
in
the
legislative
history
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
to
abolish
pregnancy-related
disqualifications
that
disqualify
a
woman
because
she
left
her
job
on
account
of
pregnancy,
or
whose
unemployment
was
a
result
of
pregnancy.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
if
that's
all
you
know,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
well,
your
honor,
if
they
never
acquire
the
knowledge.
in
other
words,
through
the
appeal
procedure
if
the
woman
is
then
denied
benefits
and
she
requests
an
appeal
of
the
determination
and
it
comes
out
at
the
hearing
that
no,
she
didn't
just
leave
her
job,
she
left
because
of
her
pregnancy,
then
i
think
that
the
state
when
they
disqualify
her
on
the
higher
administrative
level,
then
i
think
they
are
violating
the
statute.
but,
if
the
information
never
comes
out,
then
of
course
the
state
can't
be
responsible
for
something
that
they
have
no
knowledge
of
and
that's
not
been
brought
to
their
attention
by
the
claimant.
the
legislative
history
also
establishes
that
this
is
not
an
antidiscrimination
statute.
the
initial
bill,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
final
language
of
the
statute,
was
written
in
an
antidiscrimination
manner
and
had
that
bill
been
enacted,
the
missouri
supreme
court
would
have
been
correct.
but
that
language
was
discarded.
the
language
provided
in
part
that
determinations
of
voluntary
terminations
of
employment
shall
not
be
made
in
a
manner
which
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
but,
that
language
was
totally
discarded
by
congress
in
preference
for
the
broad,
comprehensive
language
which
it
finally
enacted.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
well,
your
honor,
it's
not--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--it
singles
out--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--it
singles
out
pregnancy
for
special
treatment.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that's
right,
your
honor.
disability
is
not
covered
by
the
statute.
but
it's
only
preferential
treatment
or--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--well,
it
is
in
title
7,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
with
the
current...
with
the
federal
statute
at
issue
in
this
case
requires
states
to
treat
everybody
else...
is
that--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--no,
your
honor,
because
unemployment
compensation
is
not
covered
by
title
7.
title
7
and
this
statute--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--well,
it's
not
a
specific
exclusion,
but
case
law
has
held
that
it
is
not
covered
by
title
7,
and
title
7
has
no
applicability
to
3304(a)(12).
they're
totally
different
statutes
with
different
purposes
and
different
intents.
congress
can
legislate
on
behalf
of
pregnancy
or
against
pregnancy.
as
this
court
held
in
geduldig,
congress
or
a
state
can
legislate
on
behalf
of
pregnancy
or
against
pregnancy
for
any
legitimate
basis,
and
because
of
this
compelling
problem
that
congress
was
aware
of,
congress
chose
to
legislate
on
behalf
of
pregnancy
and
yes,
maybe
it
would
have
been
preferable
to
have
legislation
that
covered
disability
and
pregnancy
also,
but
that
was
not
addressed.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
correct.
the
legislative
history
establishes
that
congress
intended
that
all
pregnancy
related
disqualifications
be
abolished.
in
a
house
report
it
was
stated
that
19
states
have
special
disqualifications
pertaining
to
pregnancy.
several
of
these
states
have
conclusive
presumptions
that
a
woman
is
unable
to
work
or
unavailable
for
work
during
certain
stages
of
her
pregnancy,
such
as
the
type
that
this
court
held
were
unconstitutional
in
the
turner
versus
employment
security
case.
but
the
house
report
continued
to
say
that
the
remainder
of
the
states
have
disqualifications
of
a
woman
because
she
left
her
job
on
account
of
pregnancy
or
because
her
unemployment
is
a
result
of
her
pregnancy.
the
commission
has
suggested
that
congress
review
the
statutory
provisions
of
these
19
states
and
determine
that
pregnancy
and
disability
were
being
different...
were
receiving
different
treatment,
and
therefore
as
a
result
of
that
congress
enacted
the
statute.
but,
that's
just
not
correct.
we
know
that
at
least
two
states,
arkansas
and
oregon,
those
states
had
policies
similar
to
the
policy
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
in
that
those
states
treated
pregnancy
and
disability
either
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
oregon,
or
very
similarly
as
in
the
case
of
arkansas.
the
legislative
history
says
nothing
about
a
comparison
of
pregnancy
disqualifications
and
disability
disqualifications.
the
only
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
ability
has
to
do
with
eligibility
determinations,
the
availability
of
someone
for
work,
and
the
ability
of
someone
to
work.
the
purpose...
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
establish
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit
pregnancy
related
disqualifications
of
all
otherwise
eligible
women.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--yes,
sir.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
initially
considered
an
antidiscrimination
statute.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
the
first
clause
says,
"no
state
shall
deny
compensation
solely
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
"
the
statute
as
enacted
was,
"no
person
shall
be
denied
compensation
solely
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
or
termination
of
pregnancy.
"
ms.
julie
s.
levin
i
think
that
congress
considered--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--i
believe
that's
what
happened,
your
honor.
yes,
i
do.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
the
statute
covers
it,
your
honor,
but
as
a
result
of
the
turner
case
it
was
a
disqualification
based
on
the
ineligibility.
in
the
legislative
history,
the
house
report
that
i
previously
referred
to
concerning
the
19-state
statutory
provisions,
that
house
report
said
that
all
of
these
disqualifications
are
inequitable
in
that
they
do
not
take
into
account
a
woman's
ability
to
work,
her
availability
for
work
or
her
efforts
to
find
work.
those
terms
are
all
part
of
every
state
eligibility
provision.
every
state
requires
that
you
be
able
to
work,
available
for
work,
and
actively
seeking
employment
in
order
to
be
eligible,
and
other
references
in
the
legislative
history
say
that
you
must
be
eligible
in
order
to
get
benefits.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that
provision
would
violate
the
statute,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
i
realize
it's
confusing,
but--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--the
disqualification
is
based
on
the
ineligibility.
in
other
words,
she
is
disqualified
because
of
her
ineligibility.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
if
the
state
said
that,
it
would
not
only
violate
the
turner
decision
in
this
case
but
it
would
also
violate
the
statute
and
that
is
because
the
legislative
history
says
that
any
disqualification,
that
presumes
that
a
woman
is
unable
to
work
or
unavailable
for
work
during
certain
stages
of
her
pregnancy,
should
be
abolished.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
it's
phrased
in
terms
of
a
disqualification
but
the
disqualification
pertains
to
the
ineligibility
and
that's
how
it's
phrased
in
the
legislative
history.
thank
you.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
that
he
does
not
understand
how
the
eligibility
provisions
that
we
found
can
apply
under
the
statute.
but
on
page
12
of
his
brief
he
acknowledges
that
the
eligibility
provisions
do
apply
because
of
the
legislative
history.
i
just
wanted
to
note
that,
in
reference
to
the
earlier
point
that
we
were
making.
this
court
should
not
defer
to
the
department
of
labor
interpretation.
first
of
all,
the
unemployment
insurance
service,
according
to
the
solicitor
general,
has
been
the
entity
or
the
unit
that
has
been
making
these
interpretations.
there
has
been
no
cited
statutory
or
regulatory
authority
for
this
unit
to
make
interpretations
of
a
federal
statute.
additionally,
there
has
been
no
official
interpretation
of
this
statute
by
the
department
of
labor.
there
has
been
no
regulation,
no
adjudication.
all
we
have
are
letters
and
memoranda,
and
under
the...
even
if
we
had
an
official
interpretation,
under
the
chevron
standards
the
precise
issue
of
this
case
has
been
dealt
with
in
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear,
that
the
statute
was
to
abolish
disqualifications
of
women
who
left
their
job
on
account
of
pregnancy.
mrs.
wimberly
left
her
job
on
account
of
pregnancy.
that's
the
only
reason
she
was
unemployed.
and
that
was
the
basis
of
her
denial
for
unemployment
compensation.
the
construction
and
the
interpretation
of
the
department
of
labor
is
not
a
permissible
interpretation.
it
does
not
make
sense
that
congress
would
have
told
states
to
abolish
their
statutory
disqualifications
of
women
based
on
pregnancy,
but
that
the
states
could
go
ahead
and
use
their
neutral
statutes
to
continue
the
same
prohibited
practices.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
get
benefits
to
women
who
were
leaving
their
jobs
because
of
pregnancy,
because
it
was
such
a
burden
and
a
hardship
for
these
women
and
their
families
that
congress
needed
to
address
the
issue,
and
congress
would
not
have
intended
that
states
use
neutral
statutes
to
continue
these
same
practices
they
told
the
states
to
abolish.
moreover,
the
department
of
labor
has
no
special
expertise
or
technical
knowledge
that's
necessary
to
interpret
this
statute.
in
the
chevron
case
the
epa
had
knowledge,
special
knowledge
necessary
to
interpret
the
clean
air
act
standards.
but
no
such
knowledge
is
necessary
in
this
case.
the
commission
has
suggested
that
title
7
will
take
care
of
the
problems
of
discrimination
and
that
this
case...
that
a
holding
in
this
case
is
going
to
conflict
with
title
7.
but
as
we
stated
earlier,
title
7
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
congress
could
very
easily
have
decided
to
give
benefits
to
women
in
this
situation
over
disability,
and
not
to
give
benefits
to
women
over
disability
in
title
7,
because
title
7
is
all-encompassing.
it's
a
heavier
burden
on
the
employer
in
title
7.
in
3304(a)(12)
the
burden
is
much
greater
on
the
employee.
unemployment
is
comparable
to
death.
it's
the
final
act.
whereas
in
title
7,
problems
that
you
have
and
you
experience
in
employment
are
not
as
great
as
the
final
act
of
unemployment.
the
hardship
to
the
woman
and
to
the
family
when
she's
unemployed,
especially
right
after
having
a
baby,
is
so
tremendous
that
congress
could
very
easily
have
decided
to
enact
this
statute
here
and
continue
having
similar
treatment
under
title
7.
additionally,
the
solicitor
general
and
the
commission
have
suggested
that
equal
protection...
i'm
sorry,
the
solicitor
general
did
not
suggest
this.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
that
there
are
no
equal
protection
problems
if
this
court
rules
in
our
favor.
the
commission,
however,
still
seems
to
see
some
equal
protection
problems.
but
this
court,
in
the
michaelam
case
and
in
the
botzger
case,
this
court
held
that
men
and
women
are
not
always
similarly
situated
and
men
and
women
are
not
similarly
situated
in
matters
of
pregnancy
and
childbirth.
a
man
can
never
experience
the
same
burden
that
a
woman
has
in
having
to
leave
your
job
because
of
pregnancy
and
being
denied
reinstatement.
and
when
men
and
women
are
not
similarly
situated,
congress
can
enact
statutes
that
distinguish
between
the
two
of
them.
mrs.
wimberly
left
her
job
only
because
of
her
pregnancy.
she
became
unemployed
only
because
of
her
pregnancy
and
only
because...
and
she
was
denied
reinstatement
by
the
state
of
missouri
solely
on
the
basis
of
her
pregnancy.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
if
there
were
a
job
available
would
she
have
been
reinstated
in
her
job?
well,
that
was
my
understanding
from
the
record.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
but
at
the
time
she
became...
that's
correct...
at
the
time
she
became
unemployed,
the
time
when
she--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--i
said
that
she
became
unemployed
at
the
time
she
was
denied
reinstatement.
it
was
at
that
time
that
she
no
longer
had
a
job
that
she
could
return
to.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
she
was
denied
on
the
basis
of
her
pregnancy,
because
she
left
because
of
her
pregnancy.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
well,
she
was...
right,
she
was
denied
not
only
because
of...
well,
there
was
no
available
position
for
her
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
denial
of
the
state
of
her
unemployment
compensation.
if
she
had
a
job,
she
would
not
be--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--if
she
had
been
ready
and
able--
ms.
julie
s.
levin
--she
would
not,
your
honor,
because
the
state
of
missouri
makes
a
distinction
between
a
bona
fide
leave
of
absence
and
a
regular
leave
of
absence.
in
a
bona
fide
leave
of
absence
the
state
of
missouri
says,
if
you're
guaranteed
reinstatement
in
your
job,
and
then
there's
no
job
available,
then
you'll
be
able
to
get
benefits.
but,
if
you
get
a
conditional
leave
of
absence,
then
you
won't
get
benefits.
ms.
julie
s.
levin
even
if
there's
a
job
available,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
