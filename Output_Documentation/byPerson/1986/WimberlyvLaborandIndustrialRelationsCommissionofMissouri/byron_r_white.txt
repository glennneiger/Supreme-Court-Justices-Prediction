so,
it's
not
an
antidiscrimination
statute;
it's
a
discrimination
statute
in
the
sense
that
it
does
single
out
pregnancy
for
special
treatment?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
view--
justice
byron
r.
white
--for
special
treatment
as
compared
with
other...
as
compared
with
other
disabilities
which
cause
a
lady
to
leave
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
state
takes
your
view
and
says,
yes,
we
understand
the
federal
statute
to
command
this,
and
then
some
other
woman
with
a
disability
who
leaves
her
work
for
a
while
and
then
is
denied
workers'
compensation,
unemployment
compensation,
says
that
the
state
is
violating
title
7,
or
a
man
leaves
his
work
on
a
disability,
because
you're
treating...
because
pregnancy
is
deemed
to
be
discrimination
based
on
sex,
isn't
it,
in
title
7
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
wouldn't
this
require
the
state
to
treat
everybody
else
the
same
as
they
treat
pregnant
women?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
title
7
require
it
to
extend
its
compensation
law
to
everybody
else
with
a
disability?
justice
byron
r.
white
specifically
excludes
it,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
under
this
provision,
a
state
could
give
preference
to
pregnancy
over
other
disabilities?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
really
isn't
totally
a
nondiscrimination
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
wouldn't
be
hard
to...
it
would
just
require
treating
everybody
else
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
--legislative
history
that
might
undermine
the
department's
position,
or
do
you
say
that
a
statute,
ambiguous
on
its
face,
must
be
construed
by
this
court
as
the
department
does
despite
the
legislative
history?
