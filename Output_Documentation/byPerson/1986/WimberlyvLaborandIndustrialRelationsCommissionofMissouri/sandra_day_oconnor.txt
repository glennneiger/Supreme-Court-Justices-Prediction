well,
the
language
of
the
statute
appears
to
speak
in
terms
of
the
reasons
that
the
state
itself
denies
the
unemployment
compensation.
it
doesn't
appear
to
relate
to
the
reasons
that
went
into
the
employee's
decision
to
leave
work
voluntarily,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
solely
on
the
basis
is...
refers
to
the
denial
by
the
state
of
the
benefits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
she
came
in
and
applied
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits
and
the
employee
working
for
the
state
said,
did
you
leave
for
reasons
related
to
the
job
or
your
employer,
and
she
says
no,
and
that's
all
the
state
knows
and
they
denied
benefits.
does
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
can
it
change
because
of
what
the
state
knows?
you
have
to
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
it
refers
to
the
state
denying
benefits
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
and
if
they
deny
it
because
she
left
work
voluntarily,
how
have
they
violated
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
the
petitioner
took
a
leave
of
absence
from
her
employment
because
of
her
pregnancy
with
the
understanding
that
she
would
be
re
hired
only
if
a
position
was
available
when
she
was
ready
to
return
to
work.
when
petitioner
notified
her
employer
that
she
wanted
to
return
to
work
there
were
no
positions
opened.
missouri,
unlike
california,
as
discussed
in
a
recent
case
before
this
court,
has
no
pregnancy
leave
requirement.
petitioner
then
filed
a
claim
for
unemployment
benefits.
her
claim
was
denied
pursuant
to
a
missouri
statute
that
disqualified
a
claimant
who
has
left
work
voluntarily
without
good
cause
attributable
to
the
work
or
the
employer.
after
her
claim
was
denied
the
petitioner
filed
suit
in
state
court,
contending
that
the
missouri
statute
was
inconsistent
with
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
the
federal
statute
provides
that
no
state
participating
in
the
federal-state
unemployment
compensation
program
shall
deny
compensation
solely
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
or
termination
of
pregnancy.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
and
hold
that
under
the
plain
language
of
the
federal
unemployment
compensation
statute,
states
are
only
prohibited
from
singling
out
pregnancy
for
unfavorable
treatment.
because
missouri
neutrally
disqualifies
all
workers
who
leave
their
jobs
for
reasons
unrelated
to
their
unemployment,
pregnancy
was
not
the
sole
basis
for
the
state's
decision
to
deny
petitioner's
claim.
