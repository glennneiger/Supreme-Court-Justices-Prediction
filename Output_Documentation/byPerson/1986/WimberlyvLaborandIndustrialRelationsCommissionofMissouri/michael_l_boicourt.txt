mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
missouri,
applicants
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits
are
disqualified
if
they
left
their
last
places
of
employment
for
reasons
which
were
not
attributable
to
their
work
or
to
their
employment.
it
makes
no
difference
how
good
their
reason
is,
from
a
personal
standpoint.
if
the
reason
is
not
work-related,
they
are
disqualified.
in
this
case,
if
mrs.
wimberly
had
left
to
recover
from
an
automobile
accident.
she
would
have
been
disqualified.
if
she
left
work
because
her
husband
was
transferred
to
a
different
city,
she
would
be
disqualified.
on
the
record
of
this
case
there
is
absolutely
no
suggestion
whatsoever
that
missouri
does
not
apply
this
work
related
standard
in
an
entirely
nondiscriminatory
way,
neutrally
applying
to
all
non-work
related
separations
from
employment.
a
temporary
physical
disability
of
any
kind
in
missouri,
if
not
work
related,
is
disqualified,
just
as
any
other
good
but
not
work
related
reason
is
disqualified.
this
suggests
the
legislative
intent
for
the
program,
the
unemployment
compensation
program
in
the
state
of
missouri,
be
related
to
actual
employment
conditions,
to
the
actual
conduct
of
employers,
to
the
actual
economic
realities
that
cause
employment.
the
issue
in
this
case,
then,
is
simple.
does
the
federal
standard
enacted
by
congress
in
1976,
providing
that
states
may
not
deny
unemployment
compensation
benefits
solely
by
reason
of
pregnancy
or
termination
of
pregnancy,
preclude
the
state
from
continuing
to
apply
this
neutral
rule
to
pregnant
applicants?
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
does
not.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
during
the
time
congress
was
deliberating,
mr.
justice,
the
department
of
labor
provided
congress
with
the
list
of
19
states
which
had
pregnancy
specific,
either
presumptive
ineligibility
requirements
or
presumptive
disqualification
requirements,
written
into
their
law.
and
congress
referred
to
those
specific
19
state
statutes
in
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
enactment
of
this
particular
law.
what
turner
did,
and
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
congress
was
reacting
to
turner,
was
just
find
that
presumptive
ineligibility;
that
is,
for
a
period
of
12
weeks
before
until
six
weeks
after
birth,
was
unconstitutional
for
so
long
a
period
of
time.
there
were
many
other
state
laws
that
had
presumptions
of
ineligibility
and
this
was
an
ineligibility
subject,
inability
to
work,
for
shorter
periods
of
time.
there
were
also
several
states
who
had
specific
statutes,
pregnancy
specific
with
respect
that
distinct
treatment
was
to
be
afforded
to
pregnant
applicants,
or
recently
pregnant
applicants.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
i
don't
know
the
precise
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
i
know
at
least
two
states
after
turner
and
after
this
legislation
was
passed
specifically
enacted
statutes
which
said
on
their
face
that
pregnancy
would
be
treated
just
like
all
other
disabilities
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation,
and
both
of
those
states'
programs
have
been
approved
by
the
department
of
labor
since
that
time.
the
states
that
changed
in
that
way,
i
believe,
were
tennessee
and...
well,
actually
i
said
states...
tennessee
and
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
not
a
state,
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
the
briefs
filed
on
behalf
of
petitioner,
it
is
suggested
that
unemployment
compensation
programs
are
insurance
programs.
in
a
way
they
are,
but
it's
employers
who
pay
the
premiums
in
the
form
of
taxes.
in
missouri
those
employers
are
insuring
against
the
risk
of
paying
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
their
former
employees
who
left
work
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
employers
conducted
their
business.
they
were
not
insuring
against
the
risk
that
their
former
employees
would
be
paid
compensation
benefits
because
they
left
work
for
personal
reasons.
the
focus
of
the
federal
law,
as
pointed
out
in
a
soliloquy
between
my
opposing
counsel
and
justice
o'connor,
is
the
reason
for
the
state's
denial
of
benefits.
the
benefits
will
not
be
denied
solely
by
reason
of
pregnancy
or
termination
of
pregnancy.
the
focus
of
the
federal
law
is
on
the
reason
for
the
denial,
not
upon
the
motivation
of
the
applicant.
the
petitioner
wants
the
court
to
read
this
statute
as
providing
that
no
one
may
be
denied
unemployment
compensation
benefits
if
she
solely
left
her
work
only
because
she
was
pregnant.
as
pointed
out
in
the
soliloquy
between
mr.
justice
scalia
and
opposing
counsel,
it
is
entirely
inconsistent
to
assume,
based
upon
that
particular
interpretation
of
law,
that
the
state
can
require
a
pregnant
woman
to
be
physically
able
to
work
but
cannot
require
her
separation
from
employment
to
be
work
related.
in
both
cases,
the
reason
she
left
work
was
because
she
was
pregnant.
the
federal
statute
does
not
speak
to
that.
the
federal
statute
speaks
to
the
reason
she
was
denied
benefits.
mrs.
wimberly
was
denied
benefits
because
the
reason
she
left
work
was
not
work
related.
all
persons
suffering
a
temporary
physical
disability
with
no
guaranteed
reinstatement
are
denied
benefits
in
missouri.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
suggests
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
single
out...
to
prohibit
states
from
singling
out
pregnancy
for
specific
treatment,
for
distinctive
treatment,
for
treatment
different
than
it
treats
other
conditions
that
applicants
may
fall
under.
we
must
impute,
i
think,
to
congress
the
ability
to
use
precision
in
its
language.
in
effect,
congress
said
states
may
not,
for
the
sole
cause
of
pregnancy,
deny
benefits.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
on
the
basis
of
this
statute
alone,
it
is
clear
that
it
doesn't
prohibit
a
state
from
preferring
pregnancy.
i
think
this
creates
other
problems
that
are
being
addressed
by
the
court
in
the
california
case.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
no,
it's
an
equality
of
treatment
statute.
that's
what
mandated.
it
doesn't
mandate
that
states
not
do
more.
it
mandates
that
pregnancy
by
treated
equally.
not
only
does
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
suggest
an
intent
that
pregnancy
specific
disqualifications
or
findings
of
ineligibility...
and
clearly
this
law
was
designed
both
for
problems
of
eligibility
and
disqualification,
both
are
reasons
for
denying
benefits.
an
applicant,
in
order
to
get
benefits
in
any
state
must
have
worked
for
a
specified
period
of
time
at
a
specified
wage,
must
be
able
and
available
to
work,
must
not
be
disqualified
for
state
law
reasons,
or
be
denied
on
the
basis
of
any
of
those
reasons.
so,
eligibility
and
disqualification
was
both
the
subject
of
the
statute.
congress
was
acting
in
a
specific
context
when
it
enacted
this
law.
i
have
already
referred
to
the
information
provided
to
congress
by
the
department
of
labor
about
the
19
states
that
had
pregnancy
specific
statutes
on
their
books.
it
was
also
replying
to
this
court's
decision,
1975
decision
in
turner
versus
department
of
employment
security.
in
effect,
all
the
information
available
to
congress,
and
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
these
are
the
things
they
were
considering,
were
concerned
with
states
that
discriminate.
i
submit
it
is
illogical
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
replace
discriminatory
state
laws
with
a
mandate,
discriminatory
state
laws
unfavorable
to
pregnant
women,
with
a
mandate
that
states
have
to
prefer
state
women.
it
did
not
intend
to
replace
discrimination
detrimental
to
women
with
discrimination
favorable
to
women.
i
think
the
only
assumption
is
that
when
congress
acts
to
eradicate
discrimination
or
distinctive
treatment
by
sex
or
by
pregnancy,
it
intends
to
legislate
the
quality
of
treatment.
two
years
after
it
enacted
this
particular
standard,
it
enacted
the
amendments
to
title
7,
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
its
language
there
specifically
said
that
in
the
work
place,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
pregnant
women
are
to
be
treated
the
same
as
others
similarly
situated.
it
is
entirely
inconsistent
that
congress
intended
to
legislate
equality
of
treatment
for
pregnant
women
in
the
workplace
with
preferential
treatment
for
pregnant
women
once
they
left
the
workplace
and
applied
for
unemployment
compensation.
both
are
employment
related.
i
think
the
assumption
must
be
that
when
congress
acts
so
close
in
time,
that
they
intended
to
act
consistently,
to
in
fact
require
the
states
to
treat
pregnant
women
the
same
way
they
treat
other
applicants
for
benefits,
which
in
missouri
is
what
occurs.
i
have
been
representing
the
state
of
missouri
and
its
agencies,
departments
and
officers
for
some
15
years,
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
experience
the
american
civil
liberties
union
has
entered
a
case
supporting
my
position
on
the
law.
and
i
think
the
american
civil
liberties
union
has
stated
the
problem
in
this
case
very
succinctly.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
when
i
saw
it,
it
made
me
sweat
a
little
bit,
mr.
justice
scalia.
given
the
potential
for
pregnancy
or
sex
based
distinctions
to
deprive
women
of
benefits
provided
others
in
similar
situations,
an
intent
to
create
a
special
category
of
entitlement
in
favor
of
pregnant
women
should
not
be
lightly
inferred.
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case.
i
assure
you
that
if
the
state
of
missouri
starts
tomorrow
preferring
the
applications
of
pregnant
women
as
against
others
with
other
disabilities,
we
will
at
least
be
some
years
down
the
road
applying
to
this
court
for
review
under
title
7
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
because
in
effect
there
would
be
sex
based
discrimination.
only
women
are
physically
capable
of
bearing
children.
so,
if
we
require
a
preference
for
women
by
the
construction
of
this
particular
statute,
we
are
requiring
a
sex
based
preference.
that
would
be
the
issue
which
would
really
challenge
the
court
on
a
discrimination
bases.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
except,
your
honor,
traditionally
in
matters
administered
under
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act,
the
states
are
given
great
latitude
in
the
manner
in
which
they
operate
their
programs.
there
is
absolutely
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
that
act
or
any
of
the
amendments
to
the
act
that
congress
ever
intended
to
take
away
from
the
states
their
ability
to
have
such
a
neutral
standard
as
is
involved
in
this
case,
that
all
separations
from
employment
be
work
related.
and
if,
in
fact,
congress
by
enacting
equal
treatment
requires
the
states
to
change
their
entire
program,
this
becomes
not
a
program
where
the
details
are
left
to
the
states
which
congress
has
always
said
is
the
case,
it
becomes
a
program
where
congress
dictates
all
the
details
of
the
program.
that's
simply
not
the
intent.
in
missouri
all
claimants
are
subject
to
the
same
pre-existing,
non-sex
based
eligibility
and
qualification
requirements.
pregnancy
is
treated
exactly
the
same
as
any
other
temporary
disability.
we
submit
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
preclude
missouri
from
continuing
to
enforce
such
a
neutral
provision
of
state
law.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
at
all.
i
think
the
previous
version
of
the
bill
says
exactly
the
same
thing
this
version
says.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
just
the
opposite
difference.
this
is
levin,
yes,
i
agree.
i
think
it
makes
no
difference
at
all.
the
original
language
is
just
more
lengthy
without
adding
anything
to
the
content.
it
does
include
discrimination
as
a
word
used
in
the
particular
statutory
language,
but
it
also
refers
specifically
to
his
qualifications
based
upon
work
related
requirements.
i
think
the
result
is
exactly
the
same.
they
were
dealing
with,
as
in
the
first
clause
of
both
versions,
decisions
of
states
solely
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed
in
this
case
and
that
it
be
found
that
missouri
can
in
fact
continue
to
enforce
this
neutral
standard
in
such
a
way
which
will
apply,
as
it
does
to
all
other
persons
who
left
their
jobs
for
non-work
related
reasons,
to
mrs.
wimberly.
thank
you.
