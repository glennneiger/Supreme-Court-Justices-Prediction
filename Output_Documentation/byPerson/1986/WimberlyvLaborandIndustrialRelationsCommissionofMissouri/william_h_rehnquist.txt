relations
commission
of
missouri.
ms.
levin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
really,
your
challenge
here
is
to
the
state's
unemployment
system,
and
is
not
to
what
j.c.
penney
did?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
you
dispute
the...
is
it
a
fact
that
the
missouri
unemployment
compensation
system
is
administered
in
a
way
so
as
to
treat
pregnancy
as
other
similar
disabilities
are
treated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
a
fact,
because
i'm
not
sure
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
view,
then,
is
that
title
7
would
address
j.c.
penney's
practices,
but
it
doesn't
address
the
state
of
missouri's
administration
of
its
unemployment
compensation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
levin.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
boicourt.
chief

you,

ms.
levin,

you
have
something
more?
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.

justice

h.
rehnquist

you,
ms.
levin.
the
case
is
