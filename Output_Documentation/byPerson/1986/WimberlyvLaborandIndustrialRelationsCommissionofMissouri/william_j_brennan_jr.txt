may
i
ask,
ms.
levin--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--i
gather
the
state
supreme
court
said
that
this
disability
was
treated
by
penney
no
differently
than
it
treated
any
other
disability
that
the
woman
suffered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
the
state
court's
rationale,
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
far
as
this
case
was
concerned
the
employer
did
treat
any
disability
the
same
as
it
treated
the
pregnancy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
might
be
the
state
rule,
the
federal
law
treats
pregnancy
specially
and
differently,
is
that
it?
