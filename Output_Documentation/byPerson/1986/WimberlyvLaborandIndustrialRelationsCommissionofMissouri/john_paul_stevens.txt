justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
a
question,
if
i
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
that
if
the
bill
in
its
earlier
form,
which
included
the
second
clause
about
determinations
under
any
provision
and
so
forth,
if
that
bill
had
been
enacted,
that
you
would
have...
your
claim
would
fail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
concede
that,
it
seems
to
me
you're
in
trouble
because
the
first
clause
of
that
bill
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
bill
that
was
enacted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
addition
of
the
words,
"or
termination
of
pregnancy"--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
change
it
from
a
discrimination
statute
to
a
preferential
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
find
that
kind
of
hard
to
follow,
frankly.
before
you
step
down,
could
you
clarify
why
it
is
that
you
think
the
legislative
history
establishes
a
distinction
that
you've
drawn
between
ineligibility
and
disqualification...
or
even
before
that,
a
question.
suppose
a
state
says,
no
person
is
ineligible
for
workers'
compensation
or
unemployment
compensation
who
is
pregnant.
no
pregnant
person
shall
be
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation.
you
say
that
the
statute
doesn't
cover
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
history?
if
the
prior
bill
had
been
enacted,
the
one
where
the
language
was
taken
out,
who
would
you
say
would
win
this
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
interesting
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
seems
to
think
it
would
have
made
a
difference,
but
just
the
opposite
difference--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wright,
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
number
of
states
in
which
this
problem
might
arise,
you
know,
the
same
kind
of
scheme
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
quite
right?
had
there
been
a
job
available,
she
would
have
received
the
job,
wouldn't
she?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
she
was
not
denied
solely
by
reason
of
her
pregnancy.
it
was
her
pregnancy,
plus
the
fact
that
somebody
else
had
her
job.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
do
you
say
she
became
unemployed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
was
also
no
longer
pregnant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
her
past
pregnancy,
of
her
former
pregnancy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
plus
the
fact
there
was
no
vacancy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
true?
if
there
had
been
a
position
available
and
they
hadn't
given
it
back
to
her,
wouldn't
it
be
a
different
case?
she'd
be
ready,
able
and
willing
to
work
and
they
say,
we're
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
had
been
a
position
available
and
she
came
back
and
said,
i
want
to
come
back,
my
leave
of
absence
is
over,
and
they'd
say,
well,
we're
sorry,
we
just
don't
think
we
want
to
employ
you.
would
she
not
have
gotten
compensation
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
there
is
a
job
available?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
