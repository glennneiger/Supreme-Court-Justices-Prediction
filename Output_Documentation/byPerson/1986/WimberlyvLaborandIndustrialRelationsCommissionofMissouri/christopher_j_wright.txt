mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appropriate
case
to
defer
to
the
department
of
labor's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
department
has
consistently
stated
that
section
3304(a)(12)
bars
states
from
singling
out
women
for
unfavorable
treatment
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy,
but
does
not
mandate
preferential
treatment.
congress
has
directed
the
secretary
to
certify
each
year
the
states
that
are
in
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
because
of
its
central
role
in
administering
the
statute,
the
department
participated
in
the
proceedings
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
section
3304(a)(12).
at
a
hearing
on
the
unemployment
compensation
laws
in
1975,
a
representative
of
the
department
testified
that
some
states
treated
inability
to
work
because
of
pregnancy
differently
from
any
other
kind
of
physical
disability,
and
that
that
different
treatment
was
undesirable.
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
section
3304(a)(12),
the
department
sent
the
states
instructions
on
its
implementation.
the
department
first
noted
that
any
provision
of
state
law
specifically
relating
to
pregnancy
in
the
determination
of
entitlement
to
benefits
must
be
deleted.
the
department
then
explained
that
the
statute,
quote,
"requires
that
the
entitlement
to
benefits
for
pregnant
claimants
be
determined
on
the
same
basis
and
under
the
same
provisions
applicable
to
all
other
claimants.
"
it
does
not
mean
that
pregnant
claimants
are
entitled
to
benefits
without
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
law
for
the
receipt
of
benefits.
it
requires
only
that
a
pregnant
claimant
not
be
treated
differently
under
the
law
from
any
other
unemployed
individual,
and
that
the
benefits
be
paid
or
denied
not
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
but
on
the
basis
of
whether
she
meets
the
statute's
condition
for
the
receipt
of
benefits.
in
a
supplement
to
those
instructions,
also
in
1976,
the
department
noted
that
some
states
denied
benefits
to
claimants
who
must
leave
their
jobs
because
of
illness
or
injury,
including
pregnancy.
the
department
stated
that
the
new
law
permits
preferential
treatment
of
pregnant
claimants,
but
does
not
mandate
preferential
treatment.
the
department
specifically
reaffirmed
the
views
it
expressed
in
1976,
in
1980
in
a
letter
solicited
during
the
litigation
of
brown
v.
porcher.
the
letter
addressed
the
validity
of
a
south
carolina
rule
which
was
essentially
indistinguishable
from
the
statute
at
issue
here,
the
rule
at
issue
here.
the
department
concluded
that
the
south
carolina
rule
was
not
inconsistent
with
federal
law
because,
quote,
"it
does
not
distinguish
between
pregnant
claimants
or
any
other
unemployed
individuals
whose
separation
is
due
to
illness.
"
unquote.
the
department
of
labor's
1976
statement
regarding
the
statute
and
its
submission
to
the
court
in
porcher
in
1980
accurately
summarized
the
federal
government's
position
in
this
case.
the
united
states
agrees
with
missouri
that
it
may
enforce
neutral
rules
in
determining
who
will
receive
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
even
though
women
who
left
work
because
of
pregnancy
are
denied
benefits
as
a
result.
the
department's
interpretation
of
the
statute
it
administers,
which
is
based
on
its
involvement
in
the
proceedings
leading
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
which
it
announced
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
the
provision
and
to
which
it
has
adhered
through
three
administrations,
is
entitled
to
considerable
deference.
petitioner
argues
primarily
that
the
department
of
labor's
interpretation
of
section
3304(a)(12)
is
not
entitled
to
deference
because
it
conflicts
with
the
statute's
unambiguous
language
which,
in
her
view,
is
that
a
woman
who
leaves
work
solely
because
she
is
pregnant
cannot
be
denied
benefits.
in
our
view
the
statute
plainly
invalidates
only
state
laws
that
single
out
women
for
unfavorable
treatment
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy,
for
the
reasons
stated
by
justice
o'connor
earlier.
the
language
of
the
statute
makes
that
clear
because
it
focuses
on
the
state's
basis
for
the
denial
of
benefits,
not
on
the
claimant's
reason
for
leaving
work,
and
prohibits
denials
based
solely
on
pregnancy.
but
assuming
that
it
is
not
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
it
only
invalidates
rules
that
single
out
pregnant
women
for
unfavorable
treatment,
it
is
nevertheless
clear
that
the
statute
does
not
mean
what
petitioner
says
it
means.
as
justice
scalia
noted
earlier,
petitioner
admits
as
she
must
that
states
are
free
to
enforce
a
number
of
neutral
rules
that
lead
to
the
denial
of
benefits
to
women
who
left
work
because
of
pregnancy,
such
as
rules
that
claimants
must
be
available
for
work
and
able
to
work.
thus,
petitioner
acknowledges
that
states
may
apply
neutral
rules
that
lead
to
the
denial
of
benefits
to
women
who
left
work
because
of
pregnancy.
we
pointed
this
flaw
in
petitioner's
argument
out
in
our
brief,
and
petitioner
replies,
as
she
did
earlier
today,
that
the
language
of
section
3304(a)(12)
addresses
only
disqualification,
not
eligibility,
so
neutral
eligibility
rules
that
lead
to
the
denial
of
benefits
to
women
who
left
work
because
of
pregnancy
are
permissible
while
neutral
rules
looking
to
disqualification
are
not.
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
petitioner's
argument.
neither
the
word
3304(a)(12).
rather,
the
statute
is
addressed
to
the
basis
for
the
state's
denial
of
benefits.
moreover,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
logically
under
petitioner's
reading
of
the
statute
a
state
could
pass
a
law
that
says,
all
women
who
leave
work
because
of
pregnancy
are
ineligible
for
benefits.
that
can't
be
what
the
statute
means.
since
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
mean
what
petitioner
says
it
plainly
means,
this
court
must
conclude
either
that
it
plainly
means
what
the
department
of
labor
in
missouri
says
it
means,
or
conclude
that
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
plainly
resolve
the
question
presented.
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
language
plainly
means
that
states
may
not
single
out
women
for
unfavorable
treatment
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy,
then
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
resolve
the
issue,
it
is
still
clear
that
the
opinion
below
should
be
affirmed
because
in
that
event
the
department
of
labor's
consistent
interpretation
of
the
statute
it
administers,
which
it
announced
contemporaneously
with
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
and
which
it
based
in
part
on
its
involvement
in
proceedings
leading
to
the
enactment,
is
entitled
to
considerable
deference.
if
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
would
imagine
that
there
could
be
legislative
history
so
plain
that
it
might
lead
to
a
contrary
conclusion.
that's
certainly
not
the
case
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
currently?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
am
not
absolutely
sure.
i
think
that
there
are
five.
that's
what
we
stated
in
our
submission
to
the
court.
