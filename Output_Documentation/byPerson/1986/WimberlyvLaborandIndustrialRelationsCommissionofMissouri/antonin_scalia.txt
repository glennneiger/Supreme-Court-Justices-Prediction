justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know
otherwise,
though.
it
was
not
alleged...
i
mean,
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
levin,
suppose
missouri
has
a
provision,
as
i
understand
many
states
do,
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
unemployment
compensation
unless
you
are
available
for
work.
now,
that
would
mean
that
an
individual
who
is
incapacitated
for
some
reason
and
cannot
work
would
not
be
entitled
to
unemployment
compensation?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
your
assertion
here
that
by
reason
of
the
federal
statute,
missouri
nonetheless
as
to
pay
unemployment
compensation
to
a
woman
who
was
unavailable
to
work
because
she
is
in
the
last
few
weeks
of
her
pregnancy?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
do
you
draw
that
line?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
treating
pregnancy
like
other
disabilities
for
the
provision
that
i
just
described,
and
they
are
treating
pregnancy
like
other
disabilities
for
the
provision
that
you
are
challenging
here.
where
in
the
federal
statute
does
it
say,
only
for
reinstatement
shall
pregnancy
mandatorily
be
treated
differently
from
other
disabilities?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
the
federal
statute
says
no
person
shall
be
denied
compensation,
is
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
is...
i
mean,
"eligible"
is
a
very
broad
word.
you
are
ineligible
because
you
are
not
available
for
work.
you
are
also
ineligible
because
you
voluntarily
quit
your
prior
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say,
then,
that
if
someone
is
fired
because
of
misconduct
on
the
job
which
for
some
reason
a
woman
could
attribute
to
the
fact
of
her
pregnancy,
all
right,
or
termination
of
pregnancy,
that
that
misconduct
would
have
to
be
excused?
justice
antonin
scalia
she
claims
some
temporary
mental
condition
due
to
post-partum
depression
or
to
the
pregnancy.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
typically,
but
this
woman
alleges
that
that's
the
case,
just
as
the
woman
in
this
case
alleges
that
the
reason
she
quit
was
because
of
her
pregnancy.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
logically
have
to
say
she
couldn't
be
fired,
wouldn't
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
it
not
clear?
on
the
principle
you're
arguing,
it
has
to
be
clear,
doesn't
it?
you're
drawing
the
line
between
disqualification
and
ineligibility.
this
is
a
disqualification.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
not
deeming
it
that.
it
is
that.
i
mean,
they
didn't
make
that
up.
it
is
in
fact,
objectively,
a
voluntary
quit
for
a
reason
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
work,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
don't
blame
the
state
for
putting
it
in
that
category.
it
is
objectively
in
that
category.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
you
told
justice
o'connor
that
it
would
not
violate
the
statute
simply
to
dismiss
somebody
for
a
voluntary
quit
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
job,
if
that's
all
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
step
two
is
that
this
is
a
voluntary
quit
unrelated
to
the
job.
suppose
the
state
has
a
reporting
system
that
is
set
up
in
such
a
way
that
all
it
ever
knows
from
the
employer,
or
from
the
applicant,
is
that
the
person
left
the
job
for
a
reason
unrelated
to
the
job.
it
doesn't
have
any
box
that
says,
you
know,
nature
of
reason
unrelated
to
the
job.
so
long
as
the
state
doesn't
acquire
this
knowledge
that
it's
pregnancy,
is
it
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
i'm
talking
about
a
state
that
establishes
a
new
eligibility
requirement,
you
have
to
be
non-pregnant.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
you
have
to
answer
my
earlier
question
differently
about
why
is
it
that
a
woman
who
can't
work
because
she
is
pregnant
is
not
entitled
to
get
compensation.
you
said
that
the
reason
she's
not
entitled,
just
as
all
other
people
who
are
disabled
from
working
are
not
entitled,
is
that
you
said,
that
was
a
disqualification
rather
than
an
ineligibility.
now,
i'm
making
pregnancy
an
ineligibility
and
now
the
next
time
you
tell
me
the
ineligibility
is
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
confusing.
it's
inconsistent.
it's
quite
clear
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--she
is
not
ineligible.
the
state
says
it's
not
an
ineligibility.
it's
a
disqualification.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
does
cover...
well,
i
am
sorry.
you
are
insisting
that
it
only
covers
disqualifications
and
not
ineligibilities?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
the
federal
statute...
what
troubles
me
about
your
case
is
that
i
don't
see
much
that
the
federal
statute
did,
if
it
did
no
more
than
prevent
discrimination
as
you
say.
how
many
states
had,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
federal
statute,
singled
out
pregnancy
as
disqualifying
somebody
from
unemployment
compensation?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
of
those
statutes
were
changed
after
turner
and
before
this
statute
was
passed?
justice
antonin
scalia
makes
you
worry,
does
it?
[laughter]
