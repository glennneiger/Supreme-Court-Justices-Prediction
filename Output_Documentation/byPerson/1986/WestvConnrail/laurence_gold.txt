mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you,
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
mr.
levy
has
indicated,
in
the
delcostello
case
this
court
held
that
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
type
of
case
is
the
statute
of
limitations
stated
in
section
10(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
that
provision
says
that
no
complaint
shall
issue
based
upon
any
unfair
labor
practice
occurring
more
than
six
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charge
with
the
board
and
the
service
of
a
copy
thereof
upon
the
person
against
whom
such
charge
is
made.
in
the
words
of
walker
versus
armco,
a
diversity
case
arising
in
a
different
context,
to
be
sure,
of
this
court
in
446
u.s.,
this
language
seems
to
us
to
plainly
be
a
statement
of
a
substantive
decision
by
the
legislature
that
actual
service
on
the
defendants
is
an
integral
part
of
the
several
policies
served
by
the
statute.
there
are
various
kinds
of
statutes
of
limitations,
and
this
appears
to
us
to
be
an
example
of
one
in
which
the
tolling
rule
is
one
which
not
only
rests
on
filing,
but
also
on
providing
notice,
that
repose
is
served
in
that
way.
mr.
laurence
gold
given
the
entirely
federal
nature
of
this
case,
my
view,
our
view
on
that,
is
that
the
answer
is
no.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
you
raise
runs
some
of
the
variations
on
the
question
of
what
the
interplay
is
between
rule
3
and
various
kinds
of
statutes
of
limitation.
and,
contrary
to
mr.
levy,
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
normal
rule
on
that
issue.
there
is
an
open
question
in
this
court,
which
the
court
has
never
treated
with
and
which
in
walker
was
specifically
preserved,
as
to
what
the
normal
rule
ought
to
be.
we
know
the
following
things,
and
i
think
only
the
following
things,
in
approaching
that
question.
first
of
all,
we
know
that
rule
3
governs
the
dates
from
which...
governs
the
date
from
which
various
timing
requirements
of
the
federal
rules
begin.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
ragan
and
that
is
what
the
court
reaffirmed
in
walker
versus
armco.
we
also
know
that
rule
3
is
not
intended
to
toll
a
state
statute
of
limitations
in
a
diversity
case.
at
that
point,
our
certain
knowledge
ends
because,
as
i've
said,
at
least
so
far
as
any
of
us
are
aware
through
our
researches
and
so
far
as
the
court
indicated
in
walker,
when
you
reach
federal
question
cases
this
court
hasn't
spoken.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
those
cases,
it
seems
to
us--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes.
the
point
is,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
that
those
are...
those
were
cases
where
the
borrowed
statute
of
limitations
says
that
a
cause
of
action
must
be
brought,
begun,
filed,
commenced,
and
don't
tell
you
what
those
words
mean.
in
that
situation,
there's
no
other
source
of
law
other
than
rule
3.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
in
those
terms
i'm
not
sure
what
the
right
answer
ought
to
be.
this
is
not
the
first
area,
if
your
recollection
is
correct
and
i
feel
that
your
knowledge
of
antitrust
law
is
almost
always
greater
than
mine--
mr.
laurence
gold
--that
may
be,
but
only
because
i've
had
a
more
painful
experience
in
here.
but
that
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
where
this
court
in
borrowing
borrows
the
statutory
material,
but
not
all
the
determinations
in
state
law
that
go
with
it.
indeed,
in
wilson
versus
garcia
new
mexico
in
the
1983
context
had
made
a
ruling
on
tolling
and
this
court
said
that
it
was...
that
ruling
was
on
a
basically
federal
question.
but
certainly--
mr.
laurence
gold
--if
there
were
a
normal
federal
rule
and
if
it
were
plain
that
in
these
borrowing
situations
that
normal
federal
rule
applies
i
would
agree
with
what
you're
saying.
but
in
the
diversity
context,
which
as
i
indicate
is
the
one
thing
we
know
in
walker,
and
in
general
in
discussing
the
borrowing
process,
the
court
has
said
that
it
isn't...
that
the
point
of
the
matter
is,
rather
than
engaging
in
judicial
creativity
to
draw
on,
because
these
matters
are
necessarily
arbitrary
to
some
extent,
you're
saying
thus
far
and
no
further
and
how
long
the
period
of
repose,
the
period
of
non-repose
ought
to
be,
that
you're
going
to
look
not
only
to
a
sum
of
days,
but
also
to
the
tolling
rules
generally.
so
that
is
what
we
know
in
terms
of
what
the
court
has
done.
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
where
the
borrowed
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
give
you
any
information
from
the
legislature,
applying
rule
3
simply
doesn't
create
a
conflict
with
anything.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
is
a
rule
for
when
an
action
is
commenced,
but
the
very
point
of
ragan
and
walker
is
that,
while
it
tells
you
when
the
action
is
commenced,
it
doesn't
tell
you
when
the
statute
of
limitations
is
tolled.
that
was
the
precise
point
of
the
analysis
in
ragan
and
the
precise
point
of
the
analysis
in
walker.
and
the
question
here
really
is
whether
in
a
borrowing
situation
this
kind
of
tolling,
tolling
where
the
legislature
says
we
want
these
people
to
have
actual
notice,
is
different
from
other
kinds
of
tolling
rules.
i
just
find
it
hard,
given
the
assigned
rationale
of
rule
3,
which
it
tells
you
certain
things
about
the
date
from
which
other
time
requirements
in
the
flow
of
litigation
mean,
to
say
that
it
is
a
rule
which
ought
to
override
a
more
specific
legislative
judgment
in
either
an
applicable
or
a
borrowed
statute
of
limitations.
on
the
other
hand,
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
when
i
was
discussing
the
matter
with
justice
stevens
is
that
it
does
make
sense
where
all
the
legislature
has
told
you
is
that
the
plaintiff
must
bring,
begin,
file,
or
commence
a
lawsuit
within
a
certain
period
of
time,
to
say
if
he
comes
into
federal
court
we'll
say
filing
the
complaint
is
bringing,
beginning,
filing,
and
commencing.
there
is
no
conflict.
you're
not
running
against
the
grain
of
any
legislative
judgment
in
such
an
instance.
and
interestingly
enough,
at
least
as
we
understand
their
presentation,
the
plaintiffs
concede
that
if
you
have
a
federal
statute
of
limitation
which
is
applicable
to
a
certain
cause
of
action
in
terms
and
requires
with
regard
to
tolling
service
in
terms,
that
federal
statute
overrides
rule
3.
that's
what
we
think
we
have
here.
we
have
an
implied
federal
cause
of
action
coming
out
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
railroad
labor
act.
this
court
has
said
that
the
statute
of...
the
implied
cause
of
action
to
sue
the
union
for
breaching
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
laurence
gold
it's
an
express
cause
of
action.
mr.
laurence
gold
so
they're
both--
mr.
laurence
gold
--correct.
and
we're
saying
that
the
court
has
said
to
that
complex
of
an
express
and
an
implied
cause
of
action
that
there
is
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
which
congress
has
devised
and
which
applies
in
this
situation.
so
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
congress
is
the
lawgiver
in
both
regards,
and
the
court
says
that
these
two
pieces
fit
together,
and
that
is
what
delcostello
says,
and
this
borrowed
federal
statute
of
limitations
is,
we
submit,
in
form
the
kind
of
statute
of
limitations
which
embodies
the
substantive
judgment
of
actual
notice.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
to
say
that
if
congress
had
added
to
301
in
so
many
words
a
requirement
of
actual
notice,
then
rule
3
wouldn't
apply,
but
since
it
is
this
process
of
drawing
implications
from
the
totality
of
what
congress
has
done
that
applies
here,
that
rule
3
does
override
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
the
point
is
that
rule
3
can
help
you
where
the
legislature
hasn't
told
you
anything
very
much,
but
that
its
basic
purpose
is
not
to
state
the
tolling
rule
or
the
form
of
notice
that
tolls
a
statute
of
limitation,
but
to
set
up
a
sequence
of
various
time
limits
if
you
have
a
proper
and
timely
cause
of
action.
and
just
in
our
judgment,
given
the
basic
theory
of
borrowing
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
that,
instead
of
engaging,
in
this
court's
words
in
johnson
versus
railway
express,
in
judicial
creativity,
but
rather
to
look
to
what
the
legislature
has
done
and
to
try
to
follow
the
lines
that
the
legislature
has
indicated,
that
it
makes
sense
to
distinguish
between
a
statute
of
limitations
which
is
applicable
in
terms
and
the
statute
of
limitations
where
it
is
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
that
this
court
determines
is
the
one
that
is
intended
to
apply.
now,
there
are
a
variety,
it
seems
to
us,
of
federal
question
cases,
and
i
simply
want
to
note
that
we
have
touched
on
several
of
them
thus
far,
but
there
are
other
kinds
as
well,
where
the
court
determines
to
borrow
a
state
statute
of
limitations.
there
may
be
situations...
and
indeed,
the
case
that
the
petitioners
put
heaviest
reliance
on,
bomar
versus
keyes,
which
is
a
learned
hand
opinion
in
the
second
circuit,
is
an
example
of
this.
there
may
be
situations
where
there's
a
statute,
a
state
statute
of
limitations
which
is
borrowed,
and
there
is
also
a
state
procedural
rule
passed
to
govern
the
state
courts.
and
the
second
circuit
said
you
weren't
going
to
borrow
that
state
procedural
rule.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
different
from
this
situation,
because
a
state
legislature
is
acting
to
regulate
its
court
system.
it
isn't
acting
to
regulate
the
federal
system.
i
note
that
simply
to
say
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
state,
barring
of
state
statutes
of
limitation
may
raise
different
questions
than
this.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
may
or
it
may
not,
justice
scalia.
at
that
point
you
do
have
a
situation,
and
i'm
plain
to
say
that
on
that
issue
i'm
agnostic.
i'm
only
pointing
out
that
it's
different
from
the
situation
we
have
here
in
a
manner
of
degree.
and
this
court
hasn't
spoken
to
it.
i'm
simply
saying
that
judge
hand's
resolution
of
the
issue
may
be
right,
and
he
had
a
habit
of
being
right.
but
it
is
different
from
this
situation.
here
we
have
in
our
view
one
lawgiver,
congress,
which
created,
passed
this
statute,
created
an
express
cause
of
action,
and
this
court
has
determined
intended
an
implied
cause
of
action,
and
congress,
which
passed
a
statute
of
limitations
which
applies.
and
at
least
in
that
kind
of
borrowing,
our
position
is
that
where
the
legislative
judgment
on
when
the
period
of
repose
begins
has
an
actual
service
element
to
it,
that
comes
in
the
package
as
one
of
the
tolling
rules
that
fits.
mr.
levy
talked
about
a
number
of
hypotheticals
about
how
service
would
and
could
be
effectuated.
i
only
want
to
point
out
two
things:
a
labor
union
that
its
members
can't
find
is
soon
going
to
be
decertified;
and
second,
we
note
in
our
brief
that
the
question
of
whether
rule
4,
which
of
course
was
treated
very
differently
in
terms
of
this
complex
of
issues
in
diversity
cases
than
rule
3
was
in
hannah
versus
plumber
and
walker
versus
armco,
whether
it
is
rule
4
which
tells
you
how
to
make
service
or
whether
it
is
the
labor
board's
mailing
is
good
enough
rule
is
a
question
that
is
of
relatively
small
moment
and
it's
not
presented
here.
the
petitioner
was
late
whichever
way
you
cut
it
as
long
as
service
within
the
six
months
was
required.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions.
mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you.
