mr.
paul
alan
levy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
so-called
hybrid
action
by
an
employee
against
his
union
and
employer,
against
the
employer
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
and
against
the
union
for
mishandling
a
grievance
which
it
had
the
exclusive
authority
to
prosecute.
this
court
has
developed
the
hybrid
cause
of
action
over
the
past
40
years
in
cases
beginning
with
steele
and
running
through
vaca
and
hines,
chosek
v.
omara,
bowen
v.
postal
service.
but
in
the
course
of
developing
the
cause
of
action,
neither
congress
nor
this
court
had
developed
a
statute
of
limitations
to
govern
hybrid
actions
in
the
course
of
creating
the
hybrid
action.
thus,
in
ups
v.
mitchell
and
delcostello
v.
teamsters,
the
court
grappled
with
the
question
of
what
was
the
most
appropriate
rule
to
adopt
by
analogy
to
fill
this
gap
in
federal
law.
ultimately
in
delcostello,
the
court
made
a
policy
judgment
that,
as
compared
to
three
or
six-year
limitation
periods,
which
is
what
were
at
issue
in
mitchell
and
delcostello,
or
a
three
month
statute
of
limitations,
also
at
issue
in
mitchell,
a
six
month
limitation
period
set
forth
for
unfair
labor
practice
charges
before
the
nlrb
was
the
most
appropriate
and
therefore
should
be
used
as
the
statute
of
limitations
for
dfr
actions,
duty
of
fair
representation
actions,
in
district
court.
what
the
court
did
not
decide
in
delcostello
was
what
had
to
be
done
within
the
six
month
period.
that
is
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
case
arose
when
petitioner
west
was
discharged
in
november
of
1981.
over
the
course
of
more
than
two
years,
petitioner
was
repeatedly
assured
by
his
union
representative
that
the
union
was
pursuing
a
grievance
for
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
during
this
period
of
time
he
was
represented
solely
by
his
union,
and
indeed
his
union
discouraged
him
from
consulting
a
lawyer
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
money
during
this
period.
in
february
1984,
west
received
a
notice
from
conrail
saying
that,
solely
as
a
matter
of
leniency,
he
would
be
reinstated.
the
notice
did
not
refer
to
the
pending
union
grievance
and
did
not
say
that
the
union
had
abandoned
his
claim
for
back
pay.
however,
in
march
of
1984
west
determined
that
the
union
had
in
fact
abandoned
his
back
pay
claim.
now,
had
west
sought
to
institute
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
at
the
national
labor
relations
board,
he
could
have
gone
to
the
nlrb
on
the
last
day
of
the
six
month
limitation
period.
he
would
have
had
to
fill
out
a
few
blanks
in
an
administrative
form
which
we
have
set
forth
as
the
last
page
of
our
brief.
the
form
would
have
been
filed
and
served
on
the
same
day,
and
service
would
have
been
effective
upon
mailing.
instead,
west
had
to
find
a
lawyer,
although
he
had
been
unemployed
for
a
period
of
more
than
two
years.
he
had
to
make
financial
arrangements
to
retain
the
lawyer.
the
lawyer
had
to
investigate
his
claim,
draft
an
eleven
page
complaint
under
the
strictures
of
rule
11,
and
file
suit.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
no,
we
do
not
suggest
that.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
but
we
do
suggest
that
the
things
that
have
to
be
done
in
order
to
file
a
complaint
are
greater
than
the
things--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--it
is
in
part
the
only
thing
that
is
relevant,
although
if
in
fact
one
of
our
arguments
is
that
if
in
fact
the
court
is
going
to
borrow
the
service
requirement
of
section
10(b)
as
well
as
the
limitations
period,
then
the
question
will
arise,
why
not
borrow
the
other
things
that
the
board
has
said
are
all
that
a
charging
party
has
to
do
in
order
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
claim?
and
we
propose
to
draw
a
line,
a
clear
line,
at
the
limitations
period
and
not
go
on
to
the
other
timeliness
rules,
including
the
service
rule.
in
any
event,
the
complaint
was
filed
within
the
six
month
period,
but
the
summons
and
complaint
were
not
served
until
three
weeks
later.
and
so
the
question
on
which
the
circuits
are
closely
divided
is
is
the
suit
untimely
on
the
ground
that
the
service
requirement
in
section
10(b)
should
be
adopted
to
govern
the
case.
now,
in
arguing
that
it
should
not,
we
rely
first
on
the
normal
rule
for
federal
question
claims,
and
in
stating
the
normal
rule
i
recognize
that
this
court
has
not
dispositively
decided
the
question.
but
virtually
every
lower
court
to
address
the
question
for
the
past
40
years,
as
well
as
the
court
below,
have
taken
the
view
that
the
normal
rule
is
that
under
rule
3
filing
the
complaint
satisfies
the
statute
of
limitations
in
a
federal
question
case
in
the
district
court.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
that's
not
true
in
a
diversity
case.
we
rely
on
the
existence
of
a
normal
federal
rule
for
two
reasons:
first,
because
there
is
a
normal
federal
rule,
it
is
not
necessary
to
look
to
section
10(b),
or
indeed
anywhere
else,
to
fill
a
gap
in
federal
law,
as
the
court
had
to
do
to
pick
a
limitations
period
in
delcostello.
and
second,
because
there
is
a
rule,
respondents
who
seek
an
exception
from
the
rule
bear
some
sort
of
burden
of
showing
that
the
exception
is
justified,
and
we
don't
think
that
they
have
shown
that
an
exception
is
justified.
but
even
if
rule
3
does
not
control,
we
think
that
the
better
rule
is
that
filing
alone
is
sufficient.
after
all,
in
delcostello
the
court
decided
that,
given
the
policies
and
the
practicalities
of
litigation
involved,
a
six
month
period
was
better
than
a
three
or
a
six
year
period
on
the
long
end
or
a
three
month
period
on
the
short
end.
now,
we
recognize
the
consequence
of
choosing
either
a
filing
rule
or
a
service
rule
is
that
the
statute
of
limitations
will
not
be
exactly
six
months
for
both
sides.
if
the
court
requires
service,
then
the
plaintiff
will
be
required
to
file
in
advance
of
six
months;
and
if
filing
alone
is
sufficient,
the
defendant
will
not
learn
of
the
suit
for
some
time
after
six
months.
but
we
submit
that
the
consequences
of
adopting
only
the
filing
rule
are
on
balance
more
attractive
or,
i
should
say,
more
consistent
with
the
policies
and
practicalities
involved
than
adopting
the
whole
package
of
nlrb
timeliness
rules.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
precisely,
and
the
uniform
rule,
the
traditional
rule
in
the
federal
courts,
is
that
filing
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
statute
of
limitations,
rather
than
simply
looking
at
each
statute
of
limitations
and
then
trying
to
discern
from
the
rules
adopted
by
the
authority
that
adopted,
that
provides
the
statute
of
limitations,
whether
service
or
indeed
something
else
is
required.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
the
only
case
in
which
a
service
rule
has
been
borrowed
is
in
the
diversity
context,
and
there
the
problem
was
that
it
would
have
been
inequitable.
the
state
provides
a
cause
of
action,
the
state
creates
a
statute
of
limitations
as
a
limitation
on
that
cause
of
action,
and
to
allow
plaintiffs
to
come
into
federal
court
when
they
could
not
come
into
state
court
because,
for
example,
service
is
required
as
a
satisfaction
of
the
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--not
of
this
court,
although
every
court
of
appeals
and
other
courts,
or
virtually
every
one,
to
consider
the
question
has,
even
though
a
state
had
a
service
rule
as
part
of
its
statute
of
limitations,
the
courts
have
borrowed
only
the
limitation
period
and
not
the
service
rule
in
federal
question
cases.
now,
the
union
draws
a
distinction.
it
says
if
the
statute
of
limitations
itself
does
not
say
requires
service,
then
it
is
appropriate
not
to
borrow
the
service
requirement
which
is
contained
in
some
other
section.
and
i
would
agree
that
most
states,
when
they
draft
statutes
of
limitations,
have
a
list
of
periods
and
then
perhaps
a
list
of
tolling
rules,
and
then
another
section
which
says
this
is
what
we
mean
by
satisfying
the
statute
of
limitations.
but
surely,
if
it
is
inappropriate
to
borrow
the
service
requirement
in
those
cases,
the
mere
fact
that
the
service
requirement
appears
in
the
same
section
of
the
united
states
code
or
the
state
code,
so
long
as
it's
a
borrowed
section,
shouldn't
make
any
difference,
we
submit.
that
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
and
so,
yes,
the
court
is
free.
the
question
has
been
reserved
in
the
ragan
case
and
in
the
walker
case.
the
court
is
free
to
decide
that
service
is
required,
that
the
borrowing
of
service
is
required
in
federal
question
cases.
but
in
doing
so,
it
would
be
overruling
a
consistent
line
of
precedent
in
all
of
the
lower
courts,
and
indeed
it
would
be
going
contrary
to
the
understanding
that
we
think,
given
the
advisory
committee
notes
back
when
the
rules
were
adopted
and
the
rules
concerning
4(j)
in
1983
the
drafters
of
the
rule
seemed
to
think
that
the
logical
interpretation
of
the
rule,
although
they
recognized
that
there
was
an
open
question,
that
the
logical
interpretation
of
a
rule
that
says
an
action
is
commenced
by
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
means
the
statute
of
limitations
is
satisfied
in
that
context.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
it
would
be
all
of
the
lower
court
cases,
but
unanimous
lower
court
cases,
unanimous
understanding.
but
you
have
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
except
this
one.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
in
a
federal
question
case,
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
just
in
federal
question
cases.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
the
civil
rights
cases.
for
example,
bomar
v.
keyes,
judge
hand's
case
in
1947,
was
a
civil
rights
case.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
that's
correct,
although
the
states
had
a
service
requirement,
albeit
it
in
a
different
section.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
in
many
cases,
not
only
lower
courts
but
in
this
court's
cases,
state
tolling
rules
have
been
borrowed,
but
only
after
first
looking
to
see
whether
there
was
a
federal
rule
to
govern
the
question.
indeed,
in
the
case
of
chardon
v.
fumero
soto,
the
court
first
looked
to
see
whether
there
was
a
federal
rule,
and
only
after
deciding--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--you
don't
borrow
unless
you
have
to.
the
difficulty
with
adopting
the
service
requirement
for
hybrid
dfr
litigation
is
that
it's
wrenched
out
of
the
context
of
administrative
practice
for
which
it
was
designed
and
applied
to
federal
litigation,
in
which
it
has
very
different
effects.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
that's
correct,
for
all
dfr
cases
and
hybrid
cases,
and
i
suppose
it
is
an
open
question
what
other
kinds
of
labor
cases
are
covered
by
delcostello
and
section
10(b).
at
the
nlrb,
after
all,
the
filing
and
the
service
of
an
administrative
charge
normally
take
place
on
the
same
day.
service
is
effective
on
mailing,
no
matter
when
it
is
received
by
the
proper
person
in
the
organization
to
take
action
on
it.
in
the
district
court,
by
contrast,
a
plaintiff
has
to
follow
various
service
rules
after
filing
and
obtaining
summonses.
various
things
can
go
wrong
in
the
course
of
seeking
service,
and
unfortunately
they
often
do.
and
yet,
if
satisfaction
of
the
statute
of
limitations
depends
on
completion
of
service
within
the
limitations
period,
the
effect
is
to
push
back
by
several
weeks
the
time
in
which
a
plaintiff
must
file
the
complaint
in
order
to
be
sure
that
his
claim
will
be
heard.
and
yet,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
delcostello--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--because
very
often
if
you
have
an
individual
process
server
the
individual
process
server
may
not
be
able
to
find
the
appropriate
member,
particularly
of
a
labor
organization,
in
order
to
effectuate
service.
now,
the
court
did
ameliorate
the
problem
of
service
by
adopting
the
mailing
rule
in
the
1983
amendments.
but
the
problem
with
the
mailing
there
are
three
problems
with
effecting
service
by
mail.
the
first
is
that
the
plaintiff
under
the
terms
of
the
mailing
rule,
rule
4(c)(2)(c),
the
plaintiff
cannot
be
sure
if
service
has
been
effected
properly
until
at
least
20
days
have
passed,
because
that
is
how
long
the
defendant
has
to
return
an
acknowledgment
form.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
this
is
a
suit
against
both
the
union
and
the
employer.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
unfortunately,
there
often
is.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
they
have
offices,
but
the
office
employee
who
sits
at
the
front
desk
is
usually
not
authorized
or
often
not
authorized
to
accept
service.
many
unions
take
the
position
that
only
their
officers
can
be
served.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
under
rule
4,
when
you're
serving
an
unincorporated
association
you
have
to
serve
a
managing
or
general
agent--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--it
depends
on
whether
that
person
is
willing
to
be
found,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
it
is
true
they
returned
the
acknowledgment
form
in
the
appropriate
manner.
but
there
are
others
in
which
it
has
been
difficult
to
effectuate
service.
for
example,
in
the
thompson
case,
the
eighth
circuit
case
on
this
subject,
it
took
a
month
and
a
half.
they
sent
a
marshal
to
the
office,
the
right
person
wasn't
in
the
office.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
but
the
problem
is--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--but
unfortunately,
the
problem
is
that
you
have
a
very
short
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
and
pushing
back
the
time
to
file
the
complaint
means
that
you
may
have
only
five
months
to
file
the
complaint
or
perhaps
even
less.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
they
can
be
both.
frequently
both
the
local
and
sometimes
a
regional
body
and
sometimes
the
international
are
joined.
it
depends
on
who
is
performing
the
representative
function
with
respect
to
the
particular
grievance.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
it
depends
on
whether
the
national
is
willing
to
accept
the
service.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
if
you
can
find
the
right
person
at
the
right
time.
but
you
cannot
always
find
the
right
person
at
the
right
time.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
there
are
people
who
do
that,
and
then
it
costs
extra
money
to
do
that.
but
they
do
not
necessarily
find
the
person
right
away,
and
the
problem
is
if
you're
the
plaintiff
and
wanting
to
be
sure
that
your
claim
is
going
to
be
heard
because
your
complaint
is
going
to
be
deemed
timely,
you
have
to
make
sure
that
you
file
it
so
that
just
in
case
you
aren't
able
to
get
service
the
first
time--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--if
they
can
find
the
right
person,
and
they
can't
always
find
the
right
person
right
away.
if
service
is
not
acknowledged,
even
using
the
mailing
example,
then
the
question
arises,
is
service
effective
despite
the
lack
of
acknowledgment,
because
if
you
say
that
you
have
to
go
if
the
court
were
to
say
or
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that,
yes,
there
is
a
process
server
available,
that
is
assuming
that
these
penurious
plaintiffs,
people
who've
been
unemployed
until
the
resolution--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--poor,
poor.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
impecunious.
if
they
have
to
rely
on
process
servers,
that
means
they
can't
rely
on
the
mail
service.
but
if
they
do
rely
on
the
mail
service,
the
question
arises
whether
they
can
effectuate
mail
service.
the
question
arises
whether
service
that
has
been
sent
by
rule
4(c)(2)(c),
but
not
acknowledged,
is
effective.
and
unfortunately,
although
the
second
circuit
has
adopted
a
rule
which
suggests
that
it
is
effective
despite
the
lack
of
acknowledgment,
other
circuits
have
taken
a
disapproving
view
of
the
second
circuit's
view.
and
that's
the
morse
v.
elmira
country
club
case,
which
is
cited
in
defendants'
briefs.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
under
the
board's
rules,
once
you
pvu

dhbrged,
that's
tif
fne
of

service
is
effective
on
mailing.
whether
or
not
even
if
the
union
claims
that
it
didn't
receive
it
or
the
employer
claims
that
it
didn't
receive
it,
service
is
effective
on
mailing
once
you've
proved
the
mailing.
now,
one
could
ameliorate
the
problem
by
adopting
all
of
the
board's
rules
about
what
you
have
to
do
to
have
a
timely
unfair
labor
practice
charge
and
what
you
have
to
do
to
have
a
timely
complaint.
you
could
start
by
adopting
the
mailing
regulation,
which
would
ameliorate
the
problem,
we
agree.
but
then
one
would
be
confronted
with
other
board
timeliness
rules,
such
as
the
rule
that
if
you
include
one
discharged
individual
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
other
discharged
individuals
discharged
around
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
course
of
events
can
be
added
later,
because
their
claims
relate
back
to
the
first
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
that
of
course
is
inconsistent
with
the
practice
under
rule
15(c).
one
might
adopt
the
rule
that
all
you
have
to
file
is
an
administrative
charge,
not
a
complaint
under
rule
8.
one
might
adopt
the
rule
that
rule
11
doesn't
apply,
which
obviously
requires
people
to
take
longer
to
put
together
complaints.
all
of
these
board
rules,
the
relation
back
rule,
the
simple
administrative
charge,
as
well
as
the
mailing
regulation
and
the
service
rule,
do
reflect
determinations
about
the
balances
between
policies
of
enforcement
and
policies
of
repose.
all
of
them
reflect
determinations
about
how
much
ought
to
have
to
be
done
how
soon
in
order
to
advance
the
balance
of
policies
served
by
section
10(b).
there
is
no
sound
reason
for
drawing
a
line
between
the
service
rule
and
the
mailing
rule,
between
the
mailing
rule
and
any
of
the
board's
other
rules.
although
it
would
certainly
ameliorate
the
burdens
on
dfr
plaintiffs,
it
would
scarcely
be
desirable
to
develop
a
separate
set
of
procedures,
timeliness
rules,
to
govern
the
litigation
of
dfr
cases,
timeliness
rules
which
indeed
would
have
to
be
discerned
from
the
decisions
of
the
nlrb.
our
approach
using
rule
3
instead
of
the
service
requirement
of
section
10(b)
has
the
advantage
of
being
a
clean
line
which
avoids
that
slippery
slope.
now,
respondent's
principal
argument
in
favor
of
a
service
requirement
is
that
the
service
requirement
allows
them
to
be
certain
after
a
six
month
period
that
their
actions
are
no
longer
subject
to
challenge.
now,
that
is
not
strictly
true
because
of
course
at
the
nlrb
service
is
effective
on
mailing,
so
it
is
some
period
of
time
after
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
is
mailed
that
they
receive
notice
of
the
challenge.
but
even
more
important,
it
is
often
not
clear
when
the
six
month
period
begins
to
run.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
it
is
effective.
now,
in
the
course
of
the
board's
investigation
one
of
the
things
they
will
do
is
contact
the
employer.
so
it
is
not
likely
to
be
more
than
a
few
weeks
before
they
receive
the
information
that
this
action
is
pending.
but
as
i
understand
the
board's
rule,
so
long
as
you
prove
that
it
was
put
in
the
mail
it
was
effective
on
mailing.
now,
it
is
true
that
unfair
labor
practice
claims,
just
like
any
other
claim,
raise
questions
of
accrual.
but
by
the
very
nature
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
the
time
of
breach
tends
to
be
unclear,
because
what
is
at
issue
is
not
simply
a
discharge,
but
rather
a
grievance
procedure
and
the
union's
failure
to
act
or
acting
improperly
in
the
course
of
a
grievance
procedure,
which
may
linger
for
months
or
even,
as
this
case,
years,
as
in
this
case
years.
even
if
one
or
both
of
the
union
and
the
employer
think
that
the
grievance
procedure
has
been
brought
to
an
end
by
a
compromise
or
a
failure
to
go
forward,
that
fact
may
not
have
been
communicated
to
the
employee,
as
here.
or
indeed,
intra-union
remedies
may
be
being
exhausted,
and
this
court
decided
in
clayton
that
very
often
intra-union
remedies
will
prevent
the
employee
from
suing
and
thus
presumably
toll
the
application
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
so
the
union's
argument
and
the
employer's
argument
that
the
service
rule
allows
them
to
be
certain
after
a
finite
six
month
period
of
time
that
their
actions
will
be
immune
from
challenge
seems
to
us
to
be
substantially
overstated.
it
is
true
under
rule
4(j),
it
is
possible
that
it
will
run
more
than
six
months,
maybe
as
much
as
ten
months.
but
that
is
far
less
than
the
kinds
of
statutes
of
limitations
with
which
this
court
was
concerned
in
delcostello
and
mitchell,
far
less
than
three
years,
far
less
than
six
years.
so
in
conclusion,
there
is
no
good
reason
not
to
follow
the
normal
federal
rule
in
federal
question
cases
that
filing
the
complaint
satisfies
the
statute
of
limitations
in
a
federal
question
case.
and
application
of
section
10(b)
service
rule
to
federal
court
litigation
would
serve
a
different
balance
of
interests
than
the
balance
of
interests
they
were
designed
to
serve
in
the
administrative
context.
given
that
different
context,
given
that
different
effect
on
the
dfr
plaintiff,
who
has
only
six
months
to
find
a
lawyer
and
institute
suit,
the
court
should
not
further
shorten
the
time
to
institute
suit
by
requiring
service
of
process
within
the
six
month
period.
and
therefore,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
first,
we
agree,
as
mr.
gold
said,
that
if
congress
decided
that
section
10(b)
should
apply
to
cases
of
this
kind,
we
would
lose.
congress
does
of
course
have
the
power
to
override
the
federal
rules.
but
congress
has
not
said
that
section
10(b)
should
apply
to
cases
of
this
kind,
or
indeed
to
any
kind
of
judicial
litigation.
this
is
a
court-created
cause
of
action
and
the
court,
because
there
was
no--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--not
against
the
employer.
it
is
a
court-created
cause
of
action
against
the
union.
it
is
a
congress-created
cause
of
action
against
the
employer.
but
of
course,
section
10(b)
doesn't
apply
at
all.
there
is
no
unfair
labor
practice
for
violating
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
because
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations,
the
court
had
to
look
for
analogies,
and
it
decided
that
the
limitations
period
in
section
10(b)
was
the
most
appropriate
analogy.
but
to
say
that
because
it
is
congress,
that
it
created
section
10(b),
makes
no
difference
as
opposed
to
the
situation
in
which
it
was
a
state
legislature
which
created
a
borrowed
cause
of
action,
because
in
neither
case
has
the
legislative
body
made
a
judgment
about
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
ought
to
apply
to
this
kind
of
case.
second,
if
you
do,
if
the
court
does
borrow
section
10(b)'s
service
requirement,
what
it
is
doing,
we
submit,
is
pushing
back
the
time
to
file
complaints,
back
towards
the
three
month
period
which
this
court
decided
in
delcostello
was
not
enough.
and
thus,
we
submit
the
court
would
be
undermining
the
vital
bulwark
to
protect
union
members
against
arbitrary
action
by
their
unions.
finally,
if
the
court
does
decide
to
borrow
section
10(b)'s
service
requirement,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
make
it
clear
that
it
is
borrowing
all
of
section
10(b),
because
even
if
the
question
is
not
directly
presented
in
this
case
it
is
presented
in
other
pending
cases,
including
at
least
one
of
the
cert
petitions
which
is
pending
the
disposition
of
this
case
presumably.
and
i
refer
there
to
the
ellisaldi
versus
machinists,
twa
versus
ellisaldi
case,
in
which
the
complaint
was
mailed
on
the
last
day
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
