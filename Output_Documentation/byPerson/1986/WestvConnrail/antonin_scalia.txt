most
of
those
things
we
can't
make
up
for
just
by
giving
you
service
time
as
well.
do
you
want
us
to
extend
it
beyond
service
time?
do
you
want
us
to
add
a
certain
number
of
days
for
finding
a
lawyer?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
so,
but
the
only
one
that's
relevant
here
is
the
service
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
one
practicality
that
we
don't
want
to
have
to
fight
this
thing
out
or
have
circuit
courts
try
to
figure
it
out
every
time
there's
a
new
borrowing
of
another
statute?
isn't
it
desirable,
apart
from
what
might
be
the
most
equitable
thing
in
this
particular
case?
isn't
there
some
desirability
of
having
a
more
or
less
uniform
rule?
and
if
we
were
to
adopt
a
uniform
rule,
wouldn't
the
one
that
seems
to
be
current,
wouldn't
that
be
the
rule
of
borrowing
the
whole
thing,
including
the
service?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
haven't
we
allowed
haven't
we
borrowed
the
service
rules
in
the
past?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
a
service
rule
been
rejected
in
any
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
impecunious.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
no
problems
at
all
in
the
administrative
service?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
notice
may
never
get
there.
you're
telling
me
it's
effective
even
if
the
notice
never
arrives.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
principle
applies,
that
whether
it's
in
the
statute
or
by
judicial
interpretation
or
whether
it's
in
another
statute,
if
you
don't
take
it
along
it
means
you
are
not
applying
precisely
what
the
borrowed
statute
of
limitations
would
do.
and
doesn't
that
amount
to
a
judgment
that,
look,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
that
precise?
we're
borrowing
anyway;
if
it
were
that
important
that
it
be
that
precise,
congress
would
have
specified
it.
so
what
we
do
is,
you
know,
pick
the
six
months
or
two
years
or
whatever
it
is,
and
use
our
normal
federal
rules
for
deciding
when
the
complaint's
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
do
borrow
that
along
with
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
there's
nothing
to
replace
it
with.
i
mean,
you've
got
to
get
tolling
rules
from
somewhere,
too.
you
don't
have
a
rule
3
that
sets
forth
the
tolling
rule.
you
do
have
a
rule
3
that
sets
forth,
we
think
or
it's
argued,
a
rule
for
when
an
action
is
commenced.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true,
it
enacts
those
filing
rules
to
govern
its
courts.
but
it
also
enacts
the
limitation
period
having
in
mind
that
the
way
that
that
period
will
be
applied
is--
