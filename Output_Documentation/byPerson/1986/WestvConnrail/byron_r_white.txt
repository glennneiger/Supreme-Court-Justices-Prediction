white
would
that
line
of
cases
be
overruled
if
we
borrowed
the
service
requirement?
justice

r.
white
except
this
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
this
is
the
only
this
is
the
only
case
that
borrows
the
service
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
talking
about
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
unfair
for
all
of
the
cases
that
borrow
10(b),
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
it
take
so
long
to
effect
a
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
a
suit
against
a
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
much
of
a
problem
of
finding
anybody
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
don't
they
have
offices?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
take
that
position,
but
that
may
not
survive.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
long
do
you
think
you
yourself
would
take
to
find
somebody
who
is
authorized
to
accept
service
for
this
particular
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
lot
of
times
if
you
really
think
you're
going
to
have
any
problem
with
this
you
don't
file
your
complaint
until
you
know
where
you
can
find
the
guy
that
you're
going
to
serve.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
before
he
can
run,
you've
got
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
that's
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
problem
of
effecting
service
by
mail
on
the
national?
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
fairly
well
established
organizations,
aren't
they?
aren't
they
used
to
getting
service
in
the
mail?
don't
most
cities
have
process
servers
that
for
a
bit
of
money
will
serve
the
right
person
and
guarantee
it?
you
just
have
to
pay
a
little
extra
money.
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
against
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
same
statute
of
limitations?
