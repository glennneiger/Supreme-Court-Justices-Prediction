what
are
your
other
types
of
federal
questions,
other
than
this
particular?
are
you
talking
about
the
antitrust
cases
and
the
1983
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
none
of
those
did
the
federal
courts
borrow
the
service
requirement
of
any
of
the
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
some
they
borrowed
the
tolling
rules,
but
not
the
service
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
basic
argument
is
you
don't
borrow
unless
you
have
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gold,
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
there
was
a
wealth
of
litigation
under
the
treble
damage
provision
of
the
antitrust
laws,
as
well
as
1983,
where
you
had
to
borrow
a
state
statute
of
limitations?
and
in
none
of
those
cases
did
anybody
ever
argue...
or
at
least
i
don't
remember
it...
that
the
state
service
requirement
applied.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
of
course
don't
have
the
same
language
that
10(b)
has.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
except
that
some
of
those
state
statutes
had
been
construed
by
state
courts
to
require
service
within
the
limitation
period,
and
that's
just
as
though
those
words
would
have
been
written
into
the
statute.
