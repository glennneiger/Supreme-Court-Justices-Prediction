mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
congress'
1972
amendment
to
section
702
of
title
vii.
it
is
an
amendment
which
restored
to
religious
employers
a
right
that
they
had
enjoyed
for
175
years
before
there
was
a
title
vii:
the
right
to
prefer
their
own
members
for
their
own
employment
without
running
afoul
of
title
vii's
prohibition
against
employment
discrimination
based
on
religion.
when
originally
enacted
in
1964,
section
702
permitted
religious
preference
hiring,
but
restricted
it
to
the
church's
religious
activities.
the
undisputed
purpose
of
the
1972
amendment
was
to
free
the
courts
and
the
eeoc
from
entangling
themselves
in
deciding
which
of
a
church's
activities
are
and
which
are
not
sufficiently
religious
to
qualify
for
the
exemption.
section
702
has
none
of
the
traditional
indicia
of
an
establishment
of
religion.
it
involves
no
endorsement,
no
subsidy,
no
preference
for
one
sect
over
another.
the
statute
simply
does
not
promote
religion.
all
that
it
does
is
to
permit
churches
to
promote
religion
in
the
same
way
that
they
have
done
for
all
but
eight
years
of
our
national
existence.
there
is
nothing
in
the
establishment
clause
that
prohibits
churches
from
promoting
religion.
indeed,
that
is
the
very
reason
for
their
existence.
and
neither
does
the
establishment
clause
prohibit
government
from
permitting
churches
to
promote
religion.
neither
the
appellees
nor
the
district
court
has
ever
really
faced
up
to
the
nature
of
the
problem
that
congress
faced,
and
the
limited
range
of
available
solutions
to
congress,
given
the
other
decisions
that
congress
made.
congress
could
have
simply
made
title
vii
applicable
only
to
race,
sex
and
national
origin.
but
once
it
decided
to
include
religion
as
one
of
its
criteria,
it
had
to
provide
some
kind
of
exemption
from
that
criterion
for
religious
employers,
lest,
in
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause,
they
be
prevented
from
hiring
their
own
members
for
purely
ecclesiastical
positions.
once
it
is
recognized
then,
as
i
gather
it
is
by
everyone
in
this
courtroom,
that
the
constitution
required
congress
to
pick
some
exemption,
the
only
real
issue
is
whether
the
constitution
precluded
the
choice
that
congress
made.
in
other
words,
congress
having
opted
for
an
anti-employment
discrimination
package
that
is
not
quite
as
large
as
the
one
the
appellees
would
have
chosen,
is
congress
constitutionally
obligated
to
make
it
larger?
the
answer
to
that
question
has
to
be
no.
surely
the
establishment
clause
is
not
violated
every
time
government
regulates
churches
to
a
lesser
degree
than
it
might
have,
or
every
time
that
it
lifts
a
governmental
burden
that
would
otherwise
be
imposed.
that
means
that
the
real
objection
to
this
statute
finds
its
roots
not
in
constitutional
law,
but
in
public
policy.
it
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
the
appellees
wish
that
congress
had
gone
further
and
prohibited
more
than
congress
chose
to
prohibit.
the
only
serious--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
do,
justice
o'connor,
for
this
reason.
i
stress
that
it
is
not
this
case,
as
you
indicated.
the
first
reason
that
i
give
that
answer
is
that
as
is
stressed
by
most
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
the
distinction
between
what
is
secular
and
what
is
sectarian
is
a
very
difficult
one
to
draw.
and,
indeed,
that
intrudes.
and
that's
why
congress
drew
the
line
where
it
did.
and
as
a
consequence,
we
think
that
at
any
point
along
the
employment
spectrum,
you're
going
to
have
some
line-drawing
problems.
therefore,
the
best
place
to
draw
the
line
is
the
place
where
congress
drew
it.
moreover,
this
court
has
said
many
times...
beginning
at
least
as
early
as
walz
versus
the
tax
commission...
that
congress
does
have
a
certain
degree
of
line-drawing
capacity
in
this
area;
that
there
is
a
channel
between
what
the
establishment
clause
prohibits
on
the
one
hand
and
the
free
exercise
requires
on
the
other,
and
that
within
that
channel
congress
may
safely
legislate.
if
that
means
anything
at
all,
we
think
it
gives
congress
the
right
to
draw
the
kind
of
distinction
that
it
drew
in
this
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
no
question;
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
a
more
difficult
choice.
but
two
points:
one,
i
think
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
you're
going
to
be
better
off
observing
the
dividing
line
that
congress
drew
and
giving
that
deference
that
the
court
has
said
since
walz
that
we
give
to
congress
in
the
area.
but,
in
any
event,
it
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
so
the
only
serious
first
amendment
issue
in
this
case
is
presented
not
by
what
congress
did
in
1972,
but
by
the
district
court's
own
test,
which
by
its
terms
requires
federal
courts
to
decide
what
a
church
really
believes
and
whether
its
practices
are
true
to
its
beliefs.
the
court's
opinion,
for
example,
quotes
the
book
of
mormon,
the
doctrine
covenants,
a
theological
treatise
entitled
"mormon
doctrine",
and
then
draws
its
own
conclusions
as
to
what
the
church's
tenets
really
are
and
whether
there
is
an
adequate
fit
between
what
the
church
believes
and
what
it
does.
we
submit
that
the
first
amendment
reserves
those
kinds
of
issues:
what
are
a
church's
beliefs,
and
are
its
practices
the
best
way
to
achieve
them
to
the
churches
themselves.
but
the
court
need
not
reach
that
issue,
because
if
the
principle
that
has
been
so
often
stated
that
there
is
some
room
between
the
floor
and
the
ceiling,
between
the
free
exercise
and
the
establishment
clause,
then
it
must
mean
at
a
very
minimum
that
congress
can
constitutionally
choose
between
two
exemptions
where
those
were
its
only
options,
where
either
one
is
going
to
have
a
differential
effect
on
religion.
but
the
one
that
congress
chooses
is
the
one
that
does
not
put
the
courts
and
the
eeoc
into
the
business
of
deciding
what
are
religious
beliefs
and
how
they
can
best
be
achieved.
finally,
the
appellees
have
never
really
faced
up
to
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
religious
benefit
case.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
congress,
starting
from
ground
zero,
gave
to
religious
organizations
something
that
they
would
not
have
had
absent
any
action
by
congress
at
all.
it
is
a
religious
exemption
case,
and
the
religious
exemption
cases
make
very
clear
that
the
rule
has
to
be
different
for
those
cases.
the
appellees
and
the
district
court's
position
is
very
simple.
it
is
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
its
effect
is
to
give
religious
employers
something
that
non-religious
employers
do
not
enjoy
and
that
it,
therefore,
fails
the
effects
prong
of
lemon.
but
if
that's
the
rule,
then
it's
hard
to
see
how
any
religious
exemption
can
ever
survive,
because
by
their
very
definition,
religious
exemptions
always
affect
religious
groups
and
always
affect
them
differently
than
other
groups.
if
that
were
enough
to
invalidate
it,
then
walz
and
gillette
would
have
to
be
overruled;
bob
jones
would
have
been
decided
differently.
and
in
united
states
versus
lee,
the
amish
social
security
exemption
case,
congress
could
not
constitutionally
have
exempted
the
amish
from
social
security
taxes,
even
if
it
had
wanted
to;
and
the
exemption
that
it
did
give,
which
is
an
exemption
that
is
still
on
the
books
to
self-employed
amish,
is
unconstitutional.
the
analysis
is
really
no
different,
if
it
is
expressed
in
terms
of
the
traditional
lemon
test,
because
if
you
assume
the
applicability
of
lemon,
then
the
analysis
is
basically
the
same.
you
look
first
to
see
whether
there
was
a
proper
purpose,
and
the
district
court
held
that
there
was.
but
lemon's
second
prong
inquires
into
primary
effect.
in
an
exemption
case,
in
determining
primaryness,
you
have
to
consider
not
just
the
effect
if
congress
had
done...
if
congress
acted,
but
you
have
to
make
a
comparison
between
the
effect
of
congress
doing
nothing
and
congress
doing
what
it
did.
the
appellees'
case
could
not
survive
a
comparative
analysis,
as
even
they
appear
to
concede
on
page
22
of
their
brief.
they
have
not
attempted
to
make
it,
and
under
those
circumstances,
this
statute
clearly
survives.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
real
question,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
is
who
is
going
to
draw
the
line
at
that
point
that
mr.
watkiss
has
defined
as,
at
the
margin?
who
is
going
to
draw
the
distinctions
between
whether
the
church
is
really
following
an
underinclusive
policy,
and
whether
it
is
more
inimical
to
the
church's
interests
to
have
the
best
squash
player
in
salt
lake,
notwithstanding
that
he's
a
catholic
but
does
keep
the
mormon
church's
standards?
who
is
the
draw
the
line
between
the
janitor
in
the
episcopalian
church
and
the
building
supervisor
in
the
desseret
gym,
or
the
person
who
is
in
charge
of
obtaining
visas
for
missionaries
for
the
mormon
church?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
definitely...
a
nonsmoking,
nondrinking
catholic;
better
in
that
respect
than
some
other
catholics
that
i
know.
i
think
that
the
best
answer...
the
best
answer
to
that
question
of
who
is
to
draw
the
line
at
the
margin
is
simply
that
you
don't
draw
it.
that
was
congress'
judgment.
it
was
congress'
judgment
after
it
had
had
eight
years
experience
of
ceasar
potentially
having
his
hands
on
the
things
of
god.
and
then
congress
simply
said,
let's
draw
it
nice
and
clean.
i
think
mr.
watkiss
has
effectively
conceded
that
that's
the
best
place
to
draw
the
line.
he's
conceded
that
even
though
my
clients
do
not
assert
section
702
for
their
purely
commercial
activities,
that
there
is
difficult
drawing
the
line
there;
and
that
if
the
courts'
statements
really
mean
anything,
that
there
is
some
room
between
scylla
and
charybdis,
then
it
has
to
mean
that
congress
can
choose
between
the
only
two
available
exemptions
to
it,
the
1964
and
the
1972
version,
particularly
when
you
consider
that
all
of
the
impacts
that
mr.
watkiss
was
talking
about
would
have
been
identical
under
the
1964
version,
if
you
accept
our
view
of
the
desseret
gym.
and
that
brings
me
to
my
next
point.
assume
that
you
disagree,
and
that
there
is
to
be
some
line...
there
is
to
be
some
line
that's
drawn,
that
there
is
some
minimum
threshold,
in
order
to
cross
what
thomas
v.
the
unemployment
commission
said,
you
have
to
get
past
a
practice
that
is
just
bizarre,
that
is
just
purely
not
religious,
this
is...
that
has
clearly
been
satisfied
in
this
case,
and
there
are
no
findings
in
the
district
court
to
the
contrary.
the
district
court
did
not
make
what
we
would
call
findings
of
fact.
it
drew
conclusions
of
law.
and
what
it
said
was,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
mormon
faith
that
requires
employment
discrimination;
and
there
is
nothing
that
requires
exercise
in
a
gym
that...
that
practices
discrimination.
but
that
takes
entirely
too
narrow
a
view,
and
gets
the
courts
far
too
deeply
into
what
mormonism
is
really
all
about,
and
the
amount
of
leeway,
administrative,
implementing
leeway
that
the
church
really
has
to
have
in
order
to
carry
out
its
objectives.
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
court...
the
church
has
concluded
that
its
purposes
can
be
furthered
by
providing
a
place
where
physical
health,
which
according
to
mormon
belief
is
intimately
linked
to
spiritual
health,
can
be
pursued
in
an
environment
where
church
standards
are
understood,
respected
and
maintained.
it's
further
concluded
that
this
can
best
be
accomplished
by
people
who
understand
those
standards
and
are
committed
to
them.
other
churches
might
reach
different
conclusions,
but
this
is
the
conclusion
that
this
church
has
made,
and
this
is
a
conclusion
that
congress
vouchsafes
to
it.
now,
finally,
there
has
been
nothing
said,
either
in
the
briefs
or
in
this
courtroom
this
morning,
about
the
fact
that
if
you
rule
against
my
clients
in
this
case,
that
all
exemptions
are
unconstitutional,
including,
i
submit,
the
1964
version,
if
you
really
apply
the
standards
that
mr.
watkiss
has
expressed
here.
congress
has
to
have
the
authority,
when
it
perceives
dangers
to
first
amendment
values
that
have
been
raised
by
congress'
own
statutes,
to
eliminate...
to
eliminate
its
own
lawmaking
as
the
cause
of
those
problems.
for
this
reason,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
