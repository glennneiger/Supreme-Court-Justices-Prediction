mr.
reynolds,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it
would
support
a
total
exemption
from
title
7,
not
just
from
the
religious
prohibition;
would
it
not?
exempt
it
from
the
racial
discrimination
and
all
other
kinds
of
discrimination?
that
kind
of
an
exemption
would
have
all
of
the
benefits
you
describe
here?
i
just
wondered
if
you
really
intended
the
argument
to
carry
that
far?
of
course,
it
isn't
presented.
justice
stevens
i
understand
that
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
as
i
understand
the
argument
you're
making,
congress
could
have
granted
religious
organizations
a
complete
exemption
from
title
7's
other
prohibitions
and
accomplished
all
the
purposes
you
are
describing
now--
justice
stevens
--and
therefore,
it
would
have
been
a
perfectly
permissible
exemption.
justice
stevens
under
the
reasoning
that
you
advanced.
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
the
catholic
squash
pro
has
tenure;
does
he?
justice
stevens
the
catholic
squash
pro
does
not
have
tenure,
he
could
be
fired
tomorrow,
as
i
understand
it,
if
they
found
a
good
mormon
squash
player.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
a
good
enough
one,
i
should
say.
justice
stevens
no,
but
all
i'm
suggesting
is,
it
seems
to
me
the
legal
issue
is
precisely
the
same,
whether
you
look
at
the
catholic
and
say
he
could
be
fired
to
be
replaced
by
a
mormon,
or
look
at
the
mormon
and
say
he
could
be
fired
because
he
doesn't
tithe.
either
way,
it's--
justice
stevens
--mr.
watkiss,
may
i
put
it
very
simply?
are
you
arguing
that
under
section
702
no
church
may
employ
people
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
religious
convictions?
in
other
words,
limit
employees.
take
the
baptists,
methodists,
presbyterians,
catholic,
jewish
synagogues,
are
you
saying
that
they
could
not
limit
employees
to
persons
who
share
their
faith?
this
is
not
your
position?
justice
stevens
--but
those
findings
merely
went
to
the
proposition
of
whether
the
operation
of
the
gym
was
a
religious
activity.
and
it's
admittedly
not.
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
question
whether
the
operation
of
the
gym
somehow
furthered
the
objectives
of
the
mormon
church
to
set
a
good
example
to
their
congregation
and
all
the
rest.
justice
stevens
no,
all
i'm
suggesting
is,
i
think
you're
overstating
the
character
of
the
judge's
findings.
all
he
found,
as
i
remember
it
was,
that
the
operation
of
the
gym
is
not
a
religious
activity.
justice
stevens
right,
but
they're
all
for
that
ultimate
proposition,
as
i
read
it.
justice
stevens
right.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
operation
of
the
gym
is
totally
unrelated
to
what
the
church
regards
as
its
mission?
justice
stevens
it's
different,
in
other
words,
from
the
case
we
often
talk
about,
running
a
spaghetti
factory
or
something
like
that
where
you
get...
claim
tax
exemption
for
it.
in
other
words,
it
has
some
connection
with
the
religion?
justice
stevens
but
mr.
watkiss,
your
opponent
says
that
the
statute
allows
churches
to
promote
religion.
isn't
that
what
you're
complaining
about?
justice
stevens
the
statute
allows
churches
to
promote
religion.
isn't
that
the
neutrality...
lack
of
neutrality
you're
complaining
about?
that
the
mormon
church
is
insisting
that
this
man
do
certain
things
that
are
required
by
the
mormon
faith.
justice
stevens
and
the
statute
doesn't
require
that.
the
statute
permits
that.
justice
stevens
it
permits
the
church
to
promote...
to
promote
its
own
religious
beliefs.
