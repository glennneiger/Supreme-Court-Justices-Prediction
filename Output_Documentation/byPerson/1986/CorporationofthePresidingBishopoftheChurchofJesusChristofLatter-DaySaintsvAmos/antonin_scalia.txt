that
would
have
been
perfectly
okay
until
what
year?

it
wasn't

that
fired

was
it?
justice

now,
wait
a
minute.
it
seems
to
me
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
the
burden
on
him.
if
there's
anything
wrong
with
this,
it's
not
the
burden
on
him
because
you
acknowledge,
don't
you,
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
with
respect
to
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
religion,
could
be
repealed
in
its
entirety;
correct?
whereupon,
the
burden
on
him
would
be
just
what
it
is
here
and
there
would
be
no
unlawfulness
about
that.
if
there
is
anything
wrong
here,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
burden
on
him.
it
has
to
do
with
the
benefit
to
the
mormon
church.
justice
scalia
could
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
religion
be
eliminated
from
the
civil
rights
act?
could
everybody
be
permitted
to
discriminate?
justice
scalia
congress
cannot
allow
private
individuals
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
it
at
all,
even
if
they
do
it
uniformly
for
everybody.
justice
scalia
or
even
a
bad
one.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
it's
reasonable
to...
or
it's
a
reasonable
judgment
to
make
that
whatever
a
religious
organization
is
doing
not
for
profit
but
gratis
is
somehow
in
furtherance
of
its
reason
for
being?
whereas,
things
that
it's
doing
for
profit,
it's
making
money
that
it
can
use
for
its
reason
for
being.
but
the
things
that
it's
doing
just
gratis,
it
must
view
as
somehow
being
related
to
its
primary
purpose.
justice
scalia
however...
you
know...
and
that's
their
judgment
rather
than
mine,
isn't
it?
justice

it's
a
pretty
good
generalization,
isn't
it?
and
it
avoids
your
getting
into
examining
the
creed
of
the
faith
and
deciding
whether
indeed
physical
culture
is
an
essential
part
of
the
mormon
religion
or
not.
and
then
it'll
maybe
be,
you
know,
accurate
90
percent
of
the
time.
justice
scalia
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
scalia
well,
to
figure
that
out,
i
have
to
study
the
book
of
mormon,
i
suppose,
and--
justice
scalia
well,
you
can
draw
a
line
very
easily
if
the
only
connection
to
their
religion
asserted
is
that
this
activity
enables
us
to
make
money
which
we
can
spend
for
the
purposes
of
our
religion.
surely,
that's
a
very
easy
line
to
draw,
and
quite
sensible.
justice
scalia
and
you
say
that
anything
that's
not
engaged
in
for
the
purpose
of
making
money
must
be
immediately
engaged
in
for
some
purpose
that
you
think
that...
that
the
religion
itself
thinks,
at
least,
is
in
furtherance
of
its
religion.
justice
scalia
what
was
the
burden
being
imposed
in
calder?
justice
scalia
but
that
was
a
duty
imposed...
that
was
a
duty
imposed
by
the
state,
right?
justice
scalia
and
what...
what
duty
is
imposed
by
the
state
here?
by
the
united
states?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
but
it's
not
the
state
doing
anything
to
him,
as
it
was
in
calder.
in
calder,
the
state
was
saying
to
the
employer,
you
must
accommodate
this
person.
the
state
moving
directly
against
an
individual.
here,
what
does
the
state
compel
an
individual
to
do?
justice
scalia
telling
him
he
must
accommodate
his
employer?
justice
scalia
that's
always
true.
justice
scalia
you
mean
the
religion
guarantees
don't
go
to
churches,
they
don't
go
to
organized
churches?
they
just
go
to
individuals,
so
that
there--
justice
scalia
xxx
what
you
just
described
is
one
way
to
look
at
it.
i
suppose
another
way
to
look
at
is
the
mormon
church
saying,
or
any
other
church
saying,
look
it,
we
collect
all
this
money
out
of
the
basket
or
tithing
or
whatever,
and
we'd
like
that
money
to
be
used
for...
for
the
members
of
our
own
church,
for
our
faithful.
that's
what
we're
for.
we're
to
serve
them.
and
we're
adopting
as
a
matter
of
policy
the
principle
that
we're
going
to
spend
this
money
in
all
of
our
enterprises
on
our
own
people.
we're
going
to
hire
our
own
people
and
so
forth.
what's
so
terrible
about
that?
justice
scalia
it
just
really
shows
the
burden's
not
a
one-way
street.
they're
willing
to
pay
the
cost
of
getting
a
second
rate
engineer
but
not
a
second
rate
squash
pro.
justice
scalia
mr.
lee,
i
hope
this
is
at
least
a
nonsmoking,
nondrinking
catholic?
