mr.
david
b.
watkiss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
after
sixteen
(16)
years
of
good
and
loyal
service
as
a
building
maintenance
engineer
in
a
public
gymnasium,
frank
mason
was
fired
solely
because
he
failed
to
satisfy
his
employer's
newly
imposed
and
inconsistenly
applied
religious
condition.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
it's
quite
true,
the
government
and
the
church
want
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts,
justice
blackmun.
in
essence
what
mr.
lee's
clients
tried
to
do
was
to
advance
their
religious
interests
through
the
use
of
the
economic
coercion
an
employer
enjoys
over
an
employee,
to
coerce
mr.
mason's
religious
beliefs
and
practices.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
that
would
have
been
perfectly
okay...
well,
it
would
have
been
lawful
under
federal
law
until
1964
and,
justice
scalia,
what
we
did
in
1964,
what
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
represents
is
a
repudiation
of
a
lot
of
the
past.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
don't
make
that
broad
a
statement,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
can
retreat
in
some
areas.
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is,
we're
dealing
with
the
religion
clauses
and
those
religion
clauses
impose
certain
unique
restrictions,
particularly
on
the
power
of
congress.
so,
whether
or
not
congress
could
tomorrow
abolish
title
7
in
its
entirety
is
not
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
that,
essentially,
is
the
government's
argument.
it
says,
"we
didn't
fire
mason".
,
so
there
are
no
cognizable
effects
under
the
establishment
clause,
as
i
understand
mr.
reynolds'
argument.
that
just
won't
work,
justice
scalia.
there
are
plenty
of
effects.
there's
lots
of
benefits
that
flow
from
being
exempted
and
there's
lots
of
burdens
that
are
visited
on
third
parties
and
the
sad
thing
about
the
government's
and
the
church's
view
of
this
case
is,
they
do
not
once
tell
you
about
the
cost
that
this
exemption
visits
on
the
religious
liberty
of
third
parties,
of
people
like
mr.
mason.
they
want
to
talk
about
economy
and
hands-off.
they
refuse
to
concede
that
the
central
value
protected
by
both
the
free
exercise
and
the
establishment
clauses
is
individual
religious
liberty
and
this
exemption
visits
a
very
heavy
direct
burden
on
the
religious
burden
on
the
religious
liberty
of
people
like
mason.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
justice
scalia,
i
do
not
accept
that
view.
i
think
it
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
burdens
on
third
parties.
the
issue
here
is
a
combination.
can
congress
accommodate
the
interests
and
preferences,
the
inconsistently
applied
preferences
of
this
religious
employer
by
visiting
so
direct
a
burden
on
the
religious
liberty
of
other
people?
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i'm
not
sure
at
this
day
and
age
that
it
could,
justice
scalia.
i
really
am
not,
whether
congress
could
just
really
take
the
word
703.
i
don't
know.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
think
it's
a
much
tougher
case.
i
think--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--i
think
you
have
the
sort
of
a
problem
this
court
dealt
with
the
reitman
versus
mulkey
case
and
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
recently
dealt
with
in--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--it's
not
a
ratchet.
it's
the
problem
that
people
have
come
to
recognize,
the
nation
has
come
to
accept
as
a
value
to
equal
employment
opportunity
principle.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
we
are
not
dealing
with
whether
congress
could
eliminate
title
7
tomorrow.
whether
congress
could
eliminate
the
prohibition
against
religious
discrimination
tomorrow.
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
whether
congress
can
draw
the
sort
of
line
that
it
drew
in
section
702.
that's
the
issue
before
this
court.
i
do
not
frankly
know.
i
think
the
considerations
are
complicated
as
to
whether
congress
could
eliminate
title
7.
i
have
my
doubts
but
that
issue
is
not
before
you.
what
is
before
you
is
a
statute
that
singles
out
religious
employers,
as
such,
for
absolute
and
sweeping
accommodation
and
that
accommodation
visits
substantial
burdens
on
third
parties
and
it
provides
substantial
benefits
to
the
religious
employer.
it
obviously
provides
substantial
benefits
to
mr.
lee's
clients
here.
they
were
essentially
using
that
power
to
force
people
into
their
church
houses
and
to
force
people
to
pay
tithing
and
they
were
doing
that
at
the
exact
same
time
they
were
exempting
from
this
new
rule
the
non-mormons
who
were
employed
at
these
entities.
for
example,
at
the
deseret
gymnasium,
the
catholic
squash
pro
wasn't
threatened.
mr.
mason
was
fired
because
he
wasn't
going
to
church
and
he
wasn't
paying
his
tithing.
so
they
could
make
exceptions
to
this
policy.
it
is
quite
clear
that
what
was
going
on
here
was
merely
a
heavy
handed
attempt
to
coerce
people
into
line.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
your
honor,
i
don't
think
he
could.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
honestly
do
not
think
he
could
and
the
notion
or--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--no,
no.
the
squash
player
is
very
significant
because
it
points
out,
really,
the
lack
of
any
religious
belief
in
operation
here.
the
mormon
church,
plainly,
among
its
six
million
members
can
find
somebody
competent
to
teach
squash
at
their
gymnasium.
it's
not
the
lack
of--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--i
fully
agree,
justice
stevens.
it's
precisely
the
same
issue.
they
can't...
our
position
is
they
can't
impose
a
religious
condition
on
people
at
that
secular
gymnasium.
you're
quite
right.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
need
to
know
what
kind
of
activity
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
know
but
in
what
sort
of
capacity?
what
the
district
court
attempted
to
do
below,
what
congress
did
in
1964
and
what
we
believe
is,
in
fact,
constitutionally
required,
is
some
sort
of
line
drawing
between
the
religious
and
the
secular.
now,
it's
important
to
remember--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
right.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
in
the
church?
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
don't
think
it
would.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
the
difference
is
that
the
activities
of
the
house
of
worship
itself
and
the
activities
of
religious
schools
are
both,
in
common
understanding
and
in
the
precedents
of
this
court
and,
indeed,
in
title
7,
recognized
for
what
they
are.
they
are
quite
close
to
the
core
functions
of
religious
practice,
and,
indeed,
the
courts
themselves
have
carved
out
an
exemption
that
congress
forgot
to
give
them
and
that
is,
for
minister-like
employees
who
are
totally
exempt
under
judicial
construction
from
title
7,
similarly,
congress
has
created
a
more
narrow
and,
i
submit,
constitutionally
more
justifiable
exemption
for
religious
schools
in
section
703(e).
now,
we
are
not
challenging
that
exemption
here.
it's
not
at
issue
here.
but
obviously,
religious
schools
are
much
more
at
the
heart
of
the
religious
mission
than
a
gymnasium,
a
department
store.
mr.
lee
says
that
there
should
be
no--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--i
think
marginally
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
your
question
is
complicated,
and
respond
to
all
of
the
parts
will
take
me
a
minute.
but
i
think
the
first
thing
i'd
like
to
focus
on
is
the
gymnasium.
the
district
court
found
a
number
of
facts
which
plainly
are
not
clearly
erroneous,
and
indeed,
on
the
record
we've
got
here,
they're
clearly
compelled.
the
district
court
found
that
there's
nothing
in
the
running
or
the
purpose
of
that
gymnasium
to
suggest
that
it
was
intended
to
spread
or
teach
religious
beliefs,
doctrine
or
the
practice
of
sacred
ritual.
its
primary
purpose
is
to
provide
facilities
for
physical
exercise
and
athletic
games.
now
that
gymnasium
is
open
to
the
public.
it
advertises
to
the
public.
those
advertisements
contain
no
religious
message.
throughout
all
the
time
that
mr.
mayson
was
employed
there,
the
mormon
church
found
it
satisfactory
to
employ
non-mormons
as
well.
and
indeed,
there
are
still
some
non-mormons
there.
your
question
also
adverted
to
the
profit/nonprofit
distinction.
the
first
problem
is,
there's
nothing
in
702
that
draws
that
line.
so
mr.
lee
is
quite
right
at
least
in
his
suggestion
that
the
mormon
church's
string
of
department
stores
could
start
imposing
these
sorts
of
tests--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--absolutely.
the
other
thing,
though--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--well,
it's
not--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--it's
not
gratis.
if
you
or
i
wanted
to
go
there
an
work
out,
justice
scalia,
we'd
pay.
the
fact
that
they
subsidize
it,
the
fact
that
it's
tax
exempt
because
it's
a
charitable
donation
of
its
facilities
to
a
wide
number
of
social
groups,
is
their
choice,
and
it's
a
laudable
choice.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
merely
say
that
profit/nonprofit
draws
a
line
responsive
to
the
first
amendment
concerns
here.
it's
too
crude
a
device,
and
it
doesn't
exist
in
the
statute.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
there
is
no
contention...
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
he
was
right...
there's
no
contention
that
there's
a
sincerely
held
religious
belief
requiring
the
running
of
the
gym;
there's
no
sincerely
held
religious
belief
requiring
that
mormons
take
exercise
in
a
church
run
gym;
and
there's
no
sincerely
held
religious
belief
requiring
that
the
employees
of
that
gym
be
mormons.
those
are
the
facts.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
that
is
clearly
compelled
on
this
record.
that
is
clearly
right.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
no,
absolutely
not.
the
fallacy
of
this...
of
this
entanglement
business
is
that...
you've
got
to
remember
the
opinion
an
which
judge
winder
rendered
his
judgment
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
mr.
mayson
was
made
on
the
basis
of
the
church's
motion
to
dismiss.
the
only
evidentiary
materials
before
the
judge
were
a
few
affidavits
by
my
clients,
and
anything
that
they
wanted
to
put
in
the
record.
they
took
their
best
shot
on
the
gymnasium.
and
the
judge
was
clearly
right
in
finding
what
he
did.
those
findings
are
not
clearly
erroneous.
they're
clearly
compelled
on
this
record.
so
what--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--they
filed
a
document,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
was
styled,
motion
to
dismiss
or
in
the
alternative
for
summary
judgment.
and
they
attached
a
number
of
affidavits
to
their
moving
papers.
and
we
responded
with
some
affidavits
of
our
own.
and
i
think
the
court
treated
it
as
a
motion
under
rule
56,
but
it
was
prior
to
any
discovery.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
absolutely.
he
took
what
they
said
about
that
gymnasium
in
their
own
papers.
we
merely
put
in
some
of
the
objectively
ascertainable
facts
about
how
the
gym
is
being
run.
those
weren't
disputed
either.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
well,
to
the
extent...
justice
scalia
was
asking
me
whether
those
findings
were
correct.
they're
plainly
correct.
they're
undisputed.
but
to
the
extent
mr.
lee
wants
to
try
to
interject
a
dispute
about
them
now,
those
findings
were
based
on
his
clients'
affidavits.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
everything
the
mormon
church
does
is
consistent
with
its
beliefs.
i
think
you
would
say
that
about
the
activities
of
any
religious
organization.
they're
not
going
to
do
something--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--well,
he
made
a
number
of
subsidiary
findings
that
back
that
up,
yes.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
well,
he
made
two
findings.
he
made
finding
one,
that
the
gymnasium
is
not
a
religious
activity;
and
that
mayson
didn't
have
any
religious
responsibilities
at
the
gym.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
no.
indeed,
i
concede
as
much.
as
i
say,
their
department
stores
are
consistent
with
their
mission.
their
television
stations
are
consistent
with
their
mission.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
think...
well,
the
problem
is,
i
think,
that
most
religions
would
say
that
everything
they
engage
in
has
some
connection
with
their
religion.
that's
not
a
line
that
gives
you
any
meaningful
differentiations.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
essentially
permits
religions
to
set
up
little
enclaves
throughout
the
economy
if
they
so
choose,
and
use
those
enclaves
to
both
advance
their
religious
mission
through
the
requirements
they
can
impose
on
their
employees,
and
also
advance
their
economic
power
in
the
secular
realm.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
well--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--justice
scalia,
maybe
that
line
can
be
drawn.
maybe
it
can't.
my
guess
is,
it'll
get
murkier.
because
my
guess
is
that
mr.
lee's
clients,
for
example,
would
say
that
they
own
a
number
of
broadcast
stations
not
just
to
make
money
but
because
it
is
a
vehicle
for
promulgating
views
and
interests
and
perspectives
that
are
consistent
with
their
beliefs.
so
i
don't
think
you're
even
going
to
get...
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
get
any
religious
employer
merely
to
say
that
something
they
do
is
only
to
make
money.
rarely
will
you.
i
won't
yield
a
meaningful
line.
let's
look
at
why
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
mr.
mayson.
this
statute
grants
absolute
and
unyielding
accommodation
to
the
interests
of
religious
employers
by
imposing
a
direct
and
a
substantial
burden,
both
secular
and
religious,
on
third
parties,
principally
the
employees.
now
in
the
thornton
v.
calder
case,
decided
in
1985,
this
court
held
that
the
state
may
not
accommodate
the
religious
interests
of
some
by
imposing
substantial
secular
burdens
on
others.
here,
it
seems
to
me,
we
have
a
much
stronger
case
of
unconstitutionality.
because
not
only
are
serious
secular
burdens
being
imposed,
but
serious
burdens
on
religious
liberty
of
other
people
are
being
imposed.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
the
burden
i
think
was
that
the
employer,
when
the
employee
invoked
the
power
of
that
statute...
and
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
under
both
of
these
statutes,
it
was
an
individual
who
invoked
the
power
of
them...
but
in
the
calder
case,
when
the
employee
told
the
employer
that
he
wanted
a
day
off
for
his
religious
reasons,
then
the
employer
had
the
duty
to
try
to
accommodate
him
taking
that
day
off.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
that's
correct.
once
an
individual
invoked
the
right.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
mayson's
given...
mayson
is
told
that
his
interest
in
not
having
his
religious
beliefs
coerced
after
16
years
of
employment
has
to
be
subordinated
to
the
mormon
church's
right
to
do
it.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
the
state
is
telling
mr.
mayson,
you
must
accommodate
your
employer?
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
that's
right.
mr.
mayson
either
pays
his
tithe
and
goes
to
church
or
loses
his
job.
section
702's
second
serious
defect
is
its
glaring
lack
of
neutrality.
now
whether
one
characterizes
the
constitutional
requirement
as
benevolent
neutrality
or
as
complete
neutrality,
section
702
is
obviously
not
benevolent,
and
it's
obviously
not
neutral.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
well,
justice
o'connor,
people
and
particularly
in
your
wallace
v.
jaffree
and
wallace
v.
jaffree
concurrence,
you
were
considering
a
type
of
accommodation
that
is
very,
very
different
than
what
we've
got
here.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
think
that's
probably
right.
and
we're
not
arguing
that
every
accommodation
is
just
because
of
a
lack
of
neutrality,
unconstitutional.
the
lack
of
neutrality
is
very
important,
though,
as
an
indicia
for
suspicion.
this
statute
is
nonneutral
in
a
couple
of
ways.
it
obviously
treats
religion
better
than
nonreligion.
it
says,
the
interests
of
mr.
lee's
clients
get
absolute
deference.
other
employers
don't
get
the
benefit,
and
mr.
mayson's
secular
interests
don't
get
the
benefit.
but
it
discriminates
among
religious
interests
too.
mr.
mayson's
religious
liberty
is
given
absolutely
no
weight.
the
interests
of
mr.
lee's
clients
to
impose
religious
qualifications
is
given
absolute
weight.
you
have
nonneutrality
going
both
ways.
religion,
nonreligion,
and
it
discriminates
among
religious
interests.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
stevens?
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
right.
the
fundamental--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--the
statute
permits
it.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
that's
right,
at
the
expense
of
individual
religious
liberty.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
statute
turns
first
amendment
values
on
their
head.
the
establishment
clause,
just
as
much
as
the
free
exercise
clause,
has
as
its
principal
concern
the
protection
of
individual
religious
liberty.
now
to
be
sure,
we
give
religious
organizations
some
degree
of
autonomy.
but
individual
religious
liberty
is
the
primary
goal
of
both
religion
clauses
of
the
constitution.
this
statute
turns
those
values
right
on
their
head.
they
say
that
we
will
accommodate
a
religious
organization
just
as
such;
let
it
do
whatever
it
wants
to
in
this
area,
regardless
of
the
cost
that
that
imposes
on
individual
religious
liberty.
sure,
it
gives
mr.
lee's
clients
a
very
powerful
tool
to
advance
religion.
but
that
tool
is
economic
coercion.
the
value
that
the
first
amendment--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--no,
not
true.
and
that's
not
what
i'm
saying,
justice
scalia.
i'm
saying
that
the
reason
we
protect...
the
reason
we
give
churches
some
degree
of
autonomy
is
because
individuals
fulfill
their
religious
needs
through
groups.
now,
the
church
and
the
government
try
to
get
some
mileage
out
of
a
couple
of
significant
cases
of
this
court,
beginning
in
the
19th
century
opinion
in
watson
v.
jones
and
continuing
through
the
kedroff
opinion,
and
most
recently,
through
the
serbian
eastern
diocese
opinion.
i
think
it's
very,
very
important
to
reflect
upon
what
those
cases
mean,
and
what
they
were
based
on.
the
cases
essentially
hold
that
there
is
a
degree
of
autonomy
afforded
to
religious
organizations
in
resolving
internal
disputes;
and
that
civil
courts
won't
interfere.
there's
a
very
important
passage
from
watson
v.
jones
that
gets
repeated
in
variably
by
the
court's
later
opinions.
and
i'd
like
to
read
it,
because
i
think
it
focuses
on
the
problem
with
702.
in
watson,
this
court
wrote:
the
right
to
organize
voluntary
religious
organizations
to
assist
in
the
expression
and
dissemination
of
religious
doctrine,
and
to
create
tribunals
for
controverted
questions
of
faith
within
the
association...
and
i'll
skip
some
of
it...
is
unquestioned.
all
who
unite
themselves
to
such
a
body
do
so
with
an
implied
consent
to
this
government,
and
are
bound
to
submit
by
it.
now
the
emphasis
on
religious
voluntarism
in
that
passage,
and
in
all
those
cases,
is
very
clear.
because
individuals
voluntary
join
churches,
we
give
churches
some
deference.
this
statute
makes
mayson
join
a
church
to
keep
his
job,
his
secular
job.
it
subverts
the
very
notion
of
voluntariness
which
is
fundamental...
which
is
a
fundamental
peg
of
the
reasons
that
we
give
churches
some
autonomy.
but
you
take
that
away,
your
churches
are
allowed
to
grow
not
because
of
the
appeal
of
their
dogma,
as
justice
douglass
put
it,
but
because
they
can
use
economic
muscle
over
employees
in
secular
activities.
we
have...
we
have
fundamentally
distorted
first
amendment
values.
you've
given
churches
a
vehicle
to
grow
through
coercion.
not
zeal,
not
appeal
of
dogma;
but
economic
coercion.
that's
fundamentally
at
odds
with
what
the
values
of
the
first
amendment...
the
first
amendment
protects.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
yes,
he's
been
a
nominal
mormon
on
and
off
throughout
his
life.
when
he
was
hired--
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
--that's
correct.
he
never
has
had
one.
and
it
never
was
a
condition
of
employment
prior
to
1980.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
i
think
it
doesn't
justify
the
burden
that
it
imposes
on
employees.
but
justice
scalia,
you
don't
have
that
case
here.
mr.
lee's
clients
are
perfectly
happy
to
keep
paying
the
squash
pro
with
the
same
proceeds.
if
they
had
a
real
consistent
belief
in
that
sort
of
thing
we'd
have
a
different
case.
i
don't
think
it
would
make
a
difference
to
the
outcome,
but
it
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
that's
right.
mr.
david
b.
watkiss
thank
you.
