mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is,
it
seems
to
me,
a
case
that
brings
to
the
court
a
first
amendment
religious
clause
challenge
to
legislative
action
in
perhaps
its
cleanest
and
simplest
form.
congress
has
barred
religious
discrimination
in
employment
decisions
under
title
vii,
but
in
so
doing
it
has
elected
in
section
702
to
exempt
from
that
prohibition
religious
organizations,
associations,
institutions
and
corporations.
rather
than
imposing
certain
obligations
on
employers
in
order
to
accommodate
a
particular
religious
view
which
was
the
case
with
the
connecticut
statutes
struck
down
in
thornton
and
caldor,
what
congress
here
has
done
is
imposed
no
obligation
on
religious
employers
in
the
interest
of
religious
accommodation.
in
essence,
it
has
adopted
a
hands-off
policy
with
regard
to
religious-based
employment
decisions
of
religious
organizations.
as
stated,
and
indeed
the
uniformly
recognized
purpose
for
leaving
religious
institutions
alone,
was
congress'
desire
to
avoid
governmental
control
over
and
entanglement
with
the
affairs
and
activities
of
religious
organizations.
as
the
court
below
correctly
found,
this
satisfies
the
secular
purpose
requirement
of
walz
and
gillette
and
the
like
cases
of
this
court.
section
702
exemption
removes
the
prospect
of
intrusive
and
likely
constitutionally-offensive
inquiry,
investigation
and
probing
by
government
into
the
religious
or
the
secular
nature
of
church-related
activities.
on
another
level,
the
exemption
eliminates
the
prospect
of
secular
control
over
and
entanglement
with
the
church's
ability
to
fulfill
its
religious
mission.
there
is
thus
no
tension
here
between
the
religious
accommodation
requirement
that's
incorporated
in
the
free
exercise
clause
and
the
establishment
clause's
prohibition
against
state
endorsement
or
advancement
of
religion.
rather,
congress'
hands-off
approach
brings
the
values
of
both
the
free
exercise
clause
and
the
establishment
clause
into
perfect
harmony.
the
exemption
from
an
intrusive
government
regulation
furthers
the
free
exercise
interest
by
preserving
the
liberty
of
religious
organizations
to
create
and
exert
authority
over
self-defining
religious
communities,
and
for
much
the
same
reason,
it
furthers
the
establishment
clause's
interest
in
avoiding
undue
secular
control
and
entanglement.
it
cannot
be,
as
appellants
argue,
that
disharmonization
fails
in
first
amendment
terms,
because
congress'
accommodation
of
religion
is
broader
in
this
instance
than
might
be
required
or
compelled
by
the
free
exercise
clause.
any
narrower
exemption,
whether
defined
along
the
lines
suggested
by
the
court
below
or
in
some
other
fashion,
would
of
necessity
bring
into
play
the
kind
of
line
drawing
on
secular
terms
that
would
exacerbate
the
very
tension
between
the
two
religious
clauses
that
congress
effectively
avoided
in
section
702.
indeed,
it's
precisely
for
this
reason
that
this
court
in
walz
and
other
decisions
has
acknowledged
that
there
is
considerable
room
between
the
floor
set
by
the
free
exercise
clause
and
the
ceiling
that's
erected
by
the
establishment
clause
in
which
legislatures
may
chart
their
own
course
of
benevolent
neutrality.
that
congress
safely
navigated
a
neutral
course
in
section
702
is
quite
clear.
the
exemption
applies
to
all
religions
even
handedly,
not
to
a
particular
sect
or
to
select
religions.
it
involves
no
endorsement
of,
financial
support
for,
or
active
involvement
in
religious
affairs
by
government.
in
this
regard,
the
wall
between
church
and
state
has
not
been
breached.
religion
is
neither
enhanced
nor
inhibited
by
the
section
702
exemption.
now,
appellees
have
argued
that
the
statute
effectively
grants
religious
employers
a
benefit,
that
is,
to
discriminate
on
account
of
religion,
which
is
unavailable
to
non-religious
employers
but
this
is
the
inevitable
consequence
of
a
hands-off
policy
by
the
governemnt
in
first
amendment
matters.
it
allows
religious
institutions
to
advance
their
own
religious
mission
on
their
own
terms
and
through
their
own
membership.
to
the
extent
such
autonomy
is
regarded
as
a
beneficial
effect
of
religious
exemption,
it
is
precisely
the
sort
of
benefit
that
is
protected,
not
condemned,
by
the
religious
liberty
interest
in
the
free
exercise
clause.
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
fault
the
exemption
because
it
might
well
open
the
door
to
uneven
treatment
of
employees,
either
as
between
or
among
various
religions
or
as
between
religious
organizations
and
those
that
are
not
religious.
whatever
the
particular
employment
decisions
and
the
religious
reasons
on
which
they
are
based
are
from
one
religion
to
another.
that
is
not
state
action
that
determines
different
individual
treatment
but
unregulated
private
action
by
religious
groups
of
the
sort
constitutionally
protected
by
the
free
exercise
clause.
here,
congress
acted
to
preserve
the
autonomy
of
religious
institutions
to
manage
their
own
affairs
with
respect
to
matters
of
religious
employment.
in
fashioning
a
broad
exemption,
congress
emphatically
removed
from
the
judicial
agenda
precisely
this
sort
of
intrusive
secular
probing
of
the
operations,
activities
and
beliefs
of
religious
institutions
that
preoccupied
the
court
below.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
would
certainly
implicate
different
considerations.
congress
here
made
the
determination
that
the
compelling
interest
in
the
furtherance
of
race
discrimination
and
sex
discrimination
under
the
statute
were
such
as
to
warrant
the
intrusion
that
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
apply
to
religious
organizations.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
congress
could
have
done
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right,
under
the
religious
clauses.
i
think
that
the
legislative
judgment
that
congress
made
is
one
that
comfortably
safeguards
the
non-interference
interests
implicated
in
the
establishment
clause,
while
fully
serving
the
religious
liberty
interests
of
religious
institutions
that
are
protected
by
the
free
exercise
clause.
perhaps
it
is
a
case
that
congress
could
have
drawn
the
exemption
line
elsewhere,
indeed
even
in
a
manner
that
produced
more
secular
entanglement
and
intrusion
by
the
courts
but
nothing
suggests
that
it
must
do
so
and
whereas
here
congress
believes
that
religious
freedom
concerns
outweigh
its
own
interests
in
imposing
the
regulations
at
issue,
it
should,
be
free
to
strike
the
balance
in
favor
of
religious
freedom.
far
from
raising
any
first
amendment
problems,
such
enlightened
self-restraint
serves
to
further
the
religious
pluralism
and
peaceful
coexistence
between
church
and
state
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
religion
clauses.
accordingly,
section
702,
religious
exemption
in
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
'64,
suffers
no
constitutional
infirmity,
in
our
view,
and
the
united
states,
therefore,
urges
reversal
of
the
district
court's
judgment.
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
no
questions.
