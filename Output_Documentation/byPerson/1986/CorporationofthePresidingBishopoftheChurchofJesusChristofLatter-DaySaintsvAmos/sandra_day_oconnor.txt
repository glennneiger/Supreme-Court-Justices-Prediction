justice
o'connor
mr.
lee,
if
i
may
inquire
about
one
matter.
i
guess
this
case
involves
nonprofit
entities
operated
by
the
lds
church?
justice
o'connor
now,
what
about
the
application
of
the
statute
to
profit-making
businesses
of
churches?
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
legitimate
secular
reason
for
the
government
to
allow
religious
entities
to
operate
profit-making
businesses
and
be
exempted
from
title
vii?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
it's
a
much
more
difficult
choice,
if
applied
to
a
profit-making
business.
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
mr.
watkiss,
you're
dealing
here,
though,
with
a...
the
production
of
religious
clothing
for
members
of
the
lds
church.
and
you're
dealing
with
the
operation
of
a
nonprofit...
on
a
nonprofit
basis
of
a
gymnasium
to
carry
out
at
least
some
aspect
of
the
lds
beliefs
and
physical
wellbeing.
so
you
don't
have
in
this
case
a
purely
profit-making
secular
operation
at
all.
you
have
something
that
at
least
is
marginally
related
to
the
function
of
the
church
itself,
don't
you?
justice
o'connor
well,
we
have
an
as
applied
challenge
here.
justice
o'connor
well,
no
accommodation
of
the
free
exercise
clause
by
government
is
ever
neutral;
it
can't
be.
i
don't
think
that's
the
test,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
government
cannot
accommodate
the
free
exercise
of
religion
and
be
regarded
as
neutral
in
doing
it.
it's
a
non
sequitar.
