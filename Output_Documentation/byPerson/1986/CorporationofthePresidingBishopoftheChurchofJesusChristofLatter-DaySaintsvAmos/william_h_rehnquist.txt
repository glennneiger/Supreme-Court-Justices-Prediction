86-179,

of
the

and
in
no.
86-401,
united
states

you

you're

mr.
lee.
chief

william
h.

mr.

we'll

from

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reynolds.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
watkiss.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
once
congress
has
enacted
a
law
such
as
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
it
can
never
retreat?
is
it
kind
of
a
ratchet?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
would
make
it
so
difficult?
what
constitutional
principle
is
it
that
prevents
congress
from
going
back
to
where
the
country
was
for
170
years
before
it
wound
up
in
1964.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
a
ratchet.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
then
if
congress
changes
its
mind,
that's
a
far
better
judge
of
what
the
nation
accepts
than
what
a
court
says.
congress
says,
"the
nation
has
simply
changed
its
mind.

chief

--xxx
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
the
case
went
off
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
did
the
findings
that
he
made
come
in,
then?
i
mean,
was
it
findings
that
were
undisputed,
basically?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
then
we
don't
have
any
clearly...
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review
here.
if
it's
undisputed,
presumably
no
one
is
going
to
challenge--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
you
don't
ordinarily
have
fact
finding
that's
reviewed
on
the
clearly
erroneous--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
watkiss.
