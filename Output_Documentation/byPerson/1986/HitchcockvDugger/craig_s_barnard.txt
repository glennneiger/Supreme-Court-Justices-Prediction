mr.
craig
s.
barnard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
hitchcock
was
sentenced
to
death
by
a
process
that
precluded
the
consideration
of
compelling
mitigating
evidence,
and
the
reason
for
that
was
that
he
was
sentenced
to
death
in
february
of
1977
in
florida,
during
the
period
of
time
when
the
florida
death
penalty
statute
stood
most
authoritatively
construed
and
enforced
to
restrict
the
consideration
of
mitigating
factors
strictly
to
a
narrow
statutory
list.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
i
disagree
with
the
eleventh
circuit
in
saying
that.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
i
disagree
with
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
the
same
court
of
appeals
had
previously
expressed
the
view
that
the
florida
statute
was
limited,
at
least
after
the
cooper
decision
in
1976.
it
was
in
this
case
that
they
said
that
there
was
some
ambiguity.
and
i
think
that,
looking
at
the
law
of
florida
at
the
time,
there
can
be
very
little
question
that
the
statute
was
interpreted
to
restrict
the
consideration
of
mitigating
factors
to
the
statute
in
the
same
manner
as
ohio,
for
the
same
reason.
and
the
restriction
of
mitigating
factors
violates
the
most
basic
eighth
amendment
principle
applicable
to
capital
sentencing
enforced
by
this
court,
and
that
is
the
need
for
individualization,
individualized
considerations
of
the
unique
factors
in
a
particular
case,
in
deciding
whether
someone
should
live
or
die.
the
constitutional
question
that's
presented
in
this
case
in
essentially
three
areas,
or
the
effect
is
seen
in
three
ways.
the
first
that
we...
i'd
like
to
mention
the
three
first:
the
first
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
just
as
in
lockett,
during
this
period
of
time;--
second,
that
the
effect
of
that
unconstitutionality
can
be
seen
in
this
case
from
the
trial
record
on
its
face;--
and
finally,
that
counsel,
defense
counsel
in
this
case,
was
restricted
in
the
presentation
of
mitigating
factors
by
reasonable
adherence
to
that
statute,
with
the
result
of
this
process
that
the
sentencer
in
this
case
did
not
know
james
ernest
hitchcock
when
it
came
to
decide
whether
he
should
live
or
die.
with
regard
to
the
statute's
unconstitutionality
at
the
time,
it's
quite
clear
now
and
it
was
then
that
florida
was
in
a
closely
parallel
position
to
ohio
at
the
time
of
furman.
florida,
as
ohio,
passed
its
capital
sentencing
statute
for
the
reason
or
with
the
intent
to
meet
the
then-perceived
requirement
of
furman
versus
georgia.
this
was...
at
the
time
the
contemporary
commentators
all
recognized
this,
including
those
advising
the
legislature,
the
florida
legislature,
and
this
intent
to
limit
the
consideration
of
mitigating
factors
to
the
statute
was
borne
out
and
made
very
clear
in
1976
when
the
florida
supreme
court
announced
its
decision
in
cooper
versus
state.
in
cooper,
the
court
spoke
with
uncommon
clarity.
the
court
there
said
that:
mitigating
factors
in
our
statute
are
limited
to
the
statute;
evidence
concerning
other
matters
has
no,
no
place
in
the
capital
sentencing
in
florida.
the
language
cannot
be
misconstrued.
it
is
clear
and
direct.
and
that,
incidentally,
is
the
period
of
time
when
this
case
was
tried.
this
case
was
tried
in
february
1977.
so
the
florida
statute
restricted
the
sentencer
in
making
the
difficult
determination
as
to
whether
to
impose
the
death
sentence
or
not
strictly
to
the
narrow
list
of
mitigating
factors,
in
the
same
way
as
the
ohio
statute,
the
ohio
legislature,
had
done
with
its
statute
and
several
other
states
had
done.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
perhaps
i
should
take
a
moment,
because
that
is
the
respondent's
chief
contention
here
as
concerns
the
facts.
i
think
we
need
to...
i
need
to
be
clear
as
to
the
relevancy
of
presenting
or
having
non-statutory
mitigating
factors
in
the
record,
in
the
trial
record
itself.
we
have
to
look
at
it
both
legally
and
factually.
first,
legally,
the
fact
that
there
are
non-statutory...
evidence
on
non-statutory
mitigating
factors
in
the
record,
is
not
the
key
or
central
constitutional
question.
there
were
non-statutory
mitigating
facts
in
the
record
in
lockett
and
in
eddings
and
in
skipper.
but
that
was
not
the
determinant
fact.
the
determinative
issue
there
was
whether
that
evidence
could
be
given
independent
mitigating
weight,
could
be
considered
on
its
own
as
a
reason
calling
for
a
life
sentence.
so,
first
i
would
question
just
the
relevancy
under
the
court's
eighth
amendment
standard
with
regard
to
those
facts.
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
facts
couldn't
be
considered
under
the
process
of
the
section.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
it
has
to
do,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
what
could
be
considered
by
the
sentencer
under
the
statutory
framework.
in
eddings,
the
statute
provided
that
all
evidence
of
mitigation
could
be
introduced,
but
it
wasn't
clear
whether
it
was
considered.
in
ohio,
the
ohio
legislature
had
liberally
interpreted
its
statute
to
indicate
that
evidence
not
falling
within
the
statute
could
be
considered
by
the
sentencer,
but
only
as
it
bore
upon
statutory
mitigating
factors.
so
the
prevailing
plurality
there
spoke
very
clearly
that
the
concern
was
whether
it
could
be
given
indendent
mitigating
weight.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes,
because
the
relevancy
under
this
question
legally
is
whether
the
evidence
was
being
given
independent
mitigating
weight
under
the
system.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
the
judge
here
said
it
couldn't
be,
and
there's
nothing
in
our
record
to
indicate
that
it
was.
and
in
making
that
evaluation,
we
have
followed
the
statutory
history
and
the
prevailing
practice
at
the
time,
and
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
that
it
could
not
be
considered.
but
i
do
want
to
address
the
issue
factually
also--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--well,
we
have
presented
in
appendix
b,
i
believe,
the
post--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--twelve
that
are
still
pending
in
some
manner,
that
were
tried
after
cooper.
in
addition,
there
were
14
others...
i
believe
the
figure's
right;
i
hope
i'm
not
misleading
the
court;
i
think
the
figure
is
right...
who
were
sentenced
prior
to
lockett
and
also
prior
to
cooper.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
depending
where
the
line
is
drawn.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes.
i
do
want
to
address
the
issue,
because
it
is
central,
concerning
the
non-statutory
mitigating
facts
in
this
record,
because
if
we
address
it
as
a
factual
matter,
as
opposed
to
a
legal
matter,
if
a
careful
reading
of
the
record
actually
supports
the
claim
we
have
made,
the
lawyer
did
not
present
new
non-statutory
mitigating
facts.
the
lawyer
presented
what
the
lawyer
had
already
been
able
to
present
in
the
guilt
phase,
and
no
further.
the
record,
i
would
submit,
shows
that
the
lawyer
had
a,
if
you
will,
a
leash
from
the
law
restraining
the
lawyer
from
presenting
evidence.
the
lawyer
pulled
that
leash,
perhaps,
but
did
not
use
the
non-statutory
mitigating
evidence
that
is
in
the
record
as
a
reason
calling
for
a
life
sentence.
the
lawyer
simply
said:
i
offer
it
to
you
for
whatever
purpose
you
deem
appropriate.
as
opposed
to
when
the
lawyer
was
talking
about
the
statutory
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
the
lawyer
analyzed
them
in
great
detail.
secondly,
the
lawyer
also
told
the
jury
that
the
jury
would
be
instructed
under
mitigating
that
it
would
be
able
to
consider,
and
then
discussed
only
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
so
the
fact
that
there
were
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
in
the
record
of
this
case
proves
nothing.
i
submit
that
it
is
legally
not
the
inquiry
and
it
does
not
alter
the
nature
of
our
claim.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
they
did
not
separately
in
this
case,
other
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
panel
brief,
where
they
just
generally
set
out
the
issue
that
we
were
alleging
denial
of
individualized
consideration.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
well,
i
think
the
claim
is
actually
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
jury
instructions
are
reflective
of
the
statute,
and
the
constitutionality
has
been
the
core
issue
throughout
this
litigation.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
and
the
jury
instructions
are
reflective
of--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--that
is
true.
the
eleventh
circuit
had
previously
treated
this
issue.
the
eleventh
circuit
had
felt
bound,
incidentally,
on
the
constitutional
question
by
the
court's
decision
here
in
proffitt
versus
florida.
we
have
also
alleged
here
in
this
case
that
the
lawyer,
the
defense
lawyer,
reasonably
followed
the
statute
and
believed
that
he
was
limited
in
his
representation
of
his
client
to
statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
we
alleged,
but
have
not
yet
been
given
an
opportunity
to
prove,
both
that
this
was
true,
that
the
lawyer
was
limited,
and
that
had
the
lawyer
not
been
limited
he
would
have
been
able
to
present
a
compelling
case
in
mitigation
concerning
hitchcock.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
to
make
a
proffer
of
proof,
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
it
is.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
at
the
trial
of
this
case
there
was
no
proffer.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
did
not.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
did
not.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
it
is
not
the
end
because
of
the
status
of
the
law
at
the
time.
our
contention
is
that
it
was
the
law
at
the
time
of
this
trial...
or
under
the
law
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
it
was
a
well-founded
belief,
both
under
the
constitution
and
certainly
the
state
law,
that
furman
had
required
a
restriction
to
statutory,
legislatively
defined
mitigating
circumstances.
the
court
held
or
noted
in
lockett
that
the
ohio
legislature
was
reasonable
in
that
view,
and
the
lawyer
here
was
reasonable
in
that
view.
in
this
regard,
our
claim
as
to
counsel
is
somewhat
analogous
to...
certainly
we
draw
upon
the
analogy...
to
a
case
where
a
lawyer
represents
conflicting
interests
and
represents
a
defendant.
and
that
is
a
legal
restraint
upon
how
counsel
represents
a
client.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
i
don't
know
that
there
would
be
a
legal
difference
at
that
time.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
you
have
to
take
the
lawyer's
sworn
testimony.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
we
submit
that
it
is
plain
constitutional
error.
we
have
submitted...
i
am
speaking
now
as
to,
i'll
call
it,
the
third
aspect
of
our
claim,
which
has
to
do
with
counsel's
conduct
that
we
had
offered
to
allege...
i
mean,
that
we
had
offered
to
prove
and
have
been
denied
a
hearing.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
well,
of
course,
that's
not
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes,
under
the
statutory
scheme,
yes.
i
think
the
importance
of
the
jury's
role,
however,
in
florida
i
think
might
distinguish
that,
and
the
court
didn't
decide,
but
in
dicta
in
baldwin
versus
alabama
observed
that
that
might
be
the
case,
that
where
deference
is
given
to
a
jury
the
constitutional
principle--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--well,
the
argument
is...
has
been
brought
about
through
the
evolution
of
florida
law
and
constitutional
law.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
i
agree
that
it's
that
simple,
but
we
haven't
been
able
to
convince
other
courts
that
it's
been
that
simple.
[laughter]
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
the
florida
statute,
thus
we
are
submitting,
operated
to
deny
what
we
have
proffered
is
very
relevant
character
evidence
concerning
mr.
hitchcock,
and
that
is
evidence
concerning
his
emotional
history
and
his
family
background,
in
order
to
prove
specific
relevant
character
traits
that
are
relevant
to
sentencing,
that
are
at
the
core
of
the
capital
sentencing
determination.
mr.
hitchcock,
this
sentencer
did
not
know,
grew
up
in
a
nightmarish
reality
of
poverty
and
grief
and
turmoil.
he
came
from
a
large
family
of
tenant
farmers,
living
in
tenant
housing
with
no
indoor
plumbing.
they
were
poor
such
that
they
were
just
on
the
border
of
starvation.
he
had
to
work
in
the
fields
when
he
was
ten
years
old,
sometimes
ten
hour
days.
his
father
died
when
he
was
young,
which
was
something
that
created
a
great
deal
of
problems
for
both
the
family
because
the
father
was
the
breadwinner
and
they
went
further
and
further
into
poverty,
and
it
also
led
mr.
hitchcock,
this
young
boy,
into
a
feeling
of
no
longer
belonging
to
his
family.
he
stuck
it
out.
his
mother
remarried.
his
stepfather
became
an
alcoholic
and
began
beating
his
mother,
and
he
couldn't
stand
it
any
longer.
so
he
left
home
at
13,
a
13
year
old
adult.
the
point
of
this
information
for
a
capital
sentencing
is
not
simply
to
show
him
as
a
human
being,
but
as
our
expert
testimony
would
allege,
would
show,
is
that
despite
the
harshest
of
environments
that
this
young
man
could
grow
up
in,
he
overcame
and
developed
very
solid
character
traits
that
were
to
stick
with
him.
this
jury
did
not
know
james
hitchcock's
capacity
for
rehabilitation,
did
not
know
his
devotion
to
hard
work,
did
not
know
his
generosity
and
sensitivity.
it
could
not
judge
mr.
hitchcock
fairly.
those
are
the
central
concerns
at
the
heart
of
that
sentencing
decision.
a
sentencer
is
attempting
to
make
a
judgment
on
the
moral
guilt
and
whether
this
person
needs
to
die.
they
have
this
young
man
sitting
in
front
of
them
they're
trying
to
judge,
but
they
don't
know
anything
about
him.
so
the
result
of
the
statute's
unconstitutionality
in
this
case
is
very
clear.
the
florida
statute
operated
at
that
time,
just
as
the
statute
in
lockett,
and
it
operated
in
this
case.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
no.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
no.
our
contention
is,
of
course,
that
the
lawyer
at
the
time
would
not...
would
not
have
known
to
do
that.
i
mean,
that's
the
merits
of
our
contention,
is
that
the
lawyer
could
not
have
done
it
at
the
time.
and
i
might
note
that
when
you
ask
objection
it
worries
me.
there
is
no
default
in
this
case.
these
issues
were
raised
in
the
supreme
court
and
dealt
with,
the
florida
supreme
court,
in
the
direct
appeal.
so
there
isn't
a
default.
the
question...
our
proof
is
that
the
lawyer
wouldn't
have
known
to
object.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
if
that
judgment
had
been
made
after
an
evidentiary
hearing,
that
might
be
a
valid
judgment
to
make.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
i
also
say
they're
wrong.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
our
allegation
was
that
things
would
have
been
different
because
of
the
evidence
that
i've
just
summarized
to
you,
all
of
which
was
in
the
record--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--well,
our
allegation
is
that
they
too
narrowly
construed
the
mandate
of
lockett,
which
allowed
them
to
reach
that
result.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
that's
true.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
that's
correct.
my
time
has
almost
expired
and
i
think
i
should
move
to
the
second
issue.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
rests
upon
the
same
constitutional
underpinnings
as
the
mccleskey
case
that
you've
just
heard,
so
i
do
not
want
to
and
we
have
not
in
our
brief
separately
addressed
the
constitutional
question.
i
simply
want
to
point
out
in
the
minute
or
so
remaining
the
differences
in
our
case
and
mccleskey,
and
that
difference
is
primarily
procedural
posture.
we
have
never
had
any
evidentiary
consideration
of
this
issue.
we're
here
after
a
summary
dismissal,
a
summary
dismissal
that
was
based
upon
a
reading
of...
which
has
been
based
upon
a
reading
of
the
early
decisions
and
has
been
handed
down
with
regard
to
florida
throughout
the
years
since
spinkellink.
we
have
established
a
prima
facie
case,
we
submit,
for
four
reasons:
first,
we
have
shown
just
the
overall
sentencing
disparity
in
florida,
that
57
percent
of
homicides
involve
white
victims,
43
percent
black
victims,
yet
death
sentences
are
imposed
in
88
88
percent
of
the
death
sentences
imposed
involve
white
victims
and
12
percent
involve
black
victims.
the
study
that
we're
primarily
relying
upon
also
goes
further
as
the
second
part
of
our
prima
facie
case
and
controls
in
studies
common
non-discriminatory
reasons
for
imposing
the
death
penalty,
to
determine
whether
there
is
some
other
explanation
for
this
disparity.
they
used
variables
which
literature
and
research
has
been
shown
to
be
the
most
predictive
of
death
sentences.
yet
within
that
group,
the
studies
show
that
the
likelihood
of
a
death
penalty
is
five
times
greater
where
the
victim
is
white.
there
are
two
other
factors
within
our
prima
facie
case.
one
is
the
unique
opportunity
for
discrimination
in
a
capital
sentencing
proceeding,
as
the
court
recognized
last
term
in
turner.
and
lastly
is
the
history
of
race
disparity
in
florida,
which
is
well
documented.
my
time
has
expired.
