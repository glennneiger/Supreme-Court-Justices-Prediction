justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
a
little
puzzled
at
your
argument.
why
do
you
have
to
take
the
lawyer's
testimony
if,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
there
is
an
erroneous
instruction
by
the
judge?
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
ball
game,
if
the
judge
says
to
the
jury,
you
can't
consider
anything
but
statutory
mitigating
instruction?
and
as
i
read
the
record,
that's
what
he
said.
isn't
that
plain
constitutional
error,
and
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
all
this
other
stuff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
this
case
is
it
not
clear
that
we
have
both
the
erroneous
jury
instruction
and
we
also
have
the
judge
in
his
own
sentencing
order
saying
that
he
based
his
decision
on
the
statutory
circumstances
and
that's
it?
so
whichever
approach
you
take,
don't
you
have
to
find
that
it's
harmless
error
or
you're
got
a
plain...
i
don't
understand
what
the
argument's
about
in
this
case,
frankly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
case
was
tried
at
a
time
when
they
weren't
under...
before
lockett.
that's
the
whole
problems,
yes.
well,
i'm
sorry.
you
make
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
that
you're
arguing
things
that
might
be
necessary
to
argue
in
other
cases,
but
seem
to
me
to
be
kind
of
an
interesting
detour
in
this
case.
well,
go
ahead.
you
present
your
own
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
suppose
you
would
also
argue
that
if
constitutional
error
was
committed,
the
court
of
appeals
here
plainly
applied
the
wrong
harmless
error
constitutional
standard.
it
didn't
find
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt;
it
just
said
it
may
not
have
hurt
him
any.
that's
hardly
the
harmless
error
standard
that's
normally
applied
in
constitutional
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
your
view
who
has
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
error
did
or
did
not
affect
the
outcome?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
on
the
whole
system;
you're
making
the
mistake
of
looking
at
the
forest
instead
of
the
trees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
daly,
what
if
federal
had
a
statute
that
said
the
death
penalty
shall
not
be
imposed
in
cases
like
this
if
the
victim
is
black?
would
this
defendant
have
standing
to
complain
about
the
situation--
