mr.
sean
daly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
to
be
decided
here
is
the
propriety
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
case
by
case
analysis
test
to
address
those
few
particular
florida
cases
that
involve
the
application
of
lockett,
cooper,
and
the
songer
decision.
addressing
first
the
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
we
note
that
the
florida
supreme
court
has
removed
any
possibility
of
an
attack
in
that
manner
in
its
interpretation
of
its
consideration
of
the
statute
and
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
in
its
songer
decision,
it
made
clear
that
cooper
was
in
no
way
intended
to
act
as
a
limitation
on
non-statutory
mitigating
evidence.
it
cited
a
number
of
cases
where
in
fact
non-statutory
mitigating
evidence
had
been
received
and
considered
in
various
capital
cases.
that
interpretation
is
of
course
binding
and
precludes
an
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
sean
daly
it
does
beg
the
question
as
to
the
ambiguity
that
counsel
or
judicial
officers
may
have
been
faced
with
in
trying
to
interpret
these
decisions.
mr.
sean
daly
yes,
sir.
mr.
sean
daly
no,
sir,
and
we
submit
that
the
district
court's--
mr.
sean
daly
--his
instruction
to
the
jury
is
interesting
in
that
it
limits
only
those
aggravating
circumstances
which
may
be
considered.
the
language
that
he
instructed
the
jury
is
completely
different.
while
he
did
provide
that
you
shall
consider
the
following
statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
that
language
did
not
in
turn
limit
the
consideration
of
other
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
sean
daly
this
of
course
must
be
read
in
contrast
to
the
instruction
just
prior
to
that,
which
specifically
limits
their
consideration
of
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
in
much
more
specific
language.
mr.
sean
daly
well,
of
course,
the
district
court
did
not
read
it
that
way.
they
do
not
determine
and
specifically
make
the
finding,
as
apparently
conceded
by
the--
mr.
sean
daly
--the
court
also
noted--
mr.
sean
daly
--while
it
might
suggest
that,
it
is
certainly
balanced
by
the
fact
that,
as
noted
again
by
the
district
court
in
a
detailed
analysis
of
each
of
these
issues,
that
the
trial
court
also
specifically
noted
that,
the
court
has
weighed
and
considered
the
total
evidence
received
in
this
case.
and
we
also
submit
that
you've
got
to
consider
that
the
fact
that
the
jury
was
specifically...
that
the
argument
presented
to
them
was
in
no
way
limited
in
terms
of
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
sean
daly
by
defense
counsel.
mr.
sean
daly
well,
it
certainly
refers
to
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
sean
daly
well,
once
again,
they
were
not
instructed
that
they
could
not
consider
them.
defense
counsel,
despite
argument
to
the
contrary,
also
specifically
argued
to
the
jury
at
the
sentencing
phase,
that,
after
giving
his
rundown
on
the
character
and
the
historical
problems
that
this
defendant
had
suffered
and
all
of
these
other
matters,
which
are
clearly
non-statutory
aspects
and
for
which
no
attempt
to
limit
him
was
presented,
he
then
said:
and
i
want
you
to
consider
the
whole
ball
of
wax
in
this
case,
the
whole
picture.
and
that
whole
picture
necessarily
encompasses
those
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
sean
daly
yes,
sir,
it
did.
mr.
sean
daly
well,
of
course,
as
noted
by
the
district
court,
that
issue
had
already
been
resolved
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that's
why
it
wasn't
specifically
addressed
by
the--
mr.
sean
daly
--no,
in
prior
decisions
on
that
same
issue,
because
this
issue...
what
happened
in
this
case
is
you
have
the
standard
jury
instruction
being
read.
so
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
this
case
has
come
before
the
eleventh
circuit.
it
has
come
before
them
in
a
number
of
contexts.
it
was
not
the
argument
which
anybody
focused
upon,
because
everyone
was
aware
of
the
decision
of--
mr.
sean
daly
--yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be.
mr.
sean
daly
if
that
had
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
sean
daly
i
definitely
do
not
agree.
the
district
court
did
not
agree.
the
eleventh
circuit
has
not
agreed.
and
we
note
that
in
other
cases,
applying
this
same
case
by
case
analysis,
the
eleventh
circuit
has
in
fact
sent
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
or
reversed
for
a
new
sentencing
hearing
where
a
judge
did
make
it
clear
that
he
felt
himself
limited.
there
is
no
indication
along
those
lines
in
this
case.
and
we
submit
that--
mr.
sean
daly
--well,
i
don't
necessarily
know
that
it
would
affected
this
case.
this
case
comes--
mr.
sean
daly
--that
is
exactly--
mr.
sean
daly
--i'm
sure
they
would
have
analyzed
that
in
their
case
by
case
analysis
test,
which
incorporates
all
of
those
factors.
one
of
the
factors
to
be
evaluated
is
just
what
would
you
have
presented.
certainly,
if
you
would
not
have
presented
anything
but
what
the
judge
heard,
then
what
is
the
problem
with
the
case?
mr.
sean
daly
that
he
potentially
didn't
consider.
mr.
sean
daly
of
course,
we
have
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
that
is
not
the
case,
to
the
contrary,
that
the
evidence
of
record
to
his
mind
indicated
that
the
judge
did
not
feel
himself
so
limited.
in
other
cases,
of
course,
we
have
had
judges
make
specific
pronouncements
that,
i
felt
myself
limited
and
was
confused
by
the
cooper-lockett
difficulty.
and
in
those
situations,
both
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
have
sent
cases
back.
we
do
not
have
that
situation
in
this
case.
instead,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
state
would
submit
that
it
was
clear
that
they
did
not...
that
the
parties
at
issue,
at
least,
did
not
perceive
themselves
limited.
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
non-statutory
mitigating
factors
that
were--
mr.
sean
daly
--it's
a
case
of
evaluating
all
of
the
factors
involved
in
their
case
by
case
analysis
test
to
see
if
that
adequately
protects
the
individualized
capital
sentencing
determination
right
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
sean
daly
well,
of
course,
in
defense
counsel's...
not
in
the
charge
instructions.
i
mean,
the
charge
instructions
are
pretty
much
laid
out,
and
it's
just
a
matter
of
whether
you
want
to
read
ambiguity,
into
them
or
whether
you
do
not.
the
district
court
and
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
chosen
not
to
read
that
ambiguity
into
them.
mr.
sean
daly
not
in
this
case.
but
of
course,
the
reason
they
didn't
find
it
necessary--
mr.
sean
daly
--i
would
submit
it
was
because
the
tenor
of
the
argument
submitted
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
at
both
levels
was
not
typically
addressed
to
the
trial
judge's
instruction.
he
was
focusing
in
on
defense
counsel,
because
he
had
talked
to
defense
counsel
and,
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
least...
or
at
the
district
court
level,
had
an
affidavit
from
counsel.
that's
what
he
made
his
argument,
and
that's
why
the
focus
of
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
addressed
to
that
argument.
his
case,
while
it
contained
a
number
of
bits
and
pieces
of
a
challenge
saying,
well,
if
lockett
didn't
do
this,
then
maybe
it
did
this
in
this
case,
or
maybe
it
did
this.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
all
of
the
circumstances.
they
looked
and
they
said
in
this
case,
we
find
that
if
you
look
you're
going
to
find
that
defense
counsel
did
not
perceive
himself
limited,
that
in
his
argument
to
the
jury
he
specifically
asked
the
jury
to
consider
all
of
these
non-statutory
mitigating
factors
that
were
brought
out
both
at
trial
and
in
sentencing.
if
you
look,
for
instance,
during
the
trial
phase
of
this
case,
you're
going
to
find
a
number
of
relevancy
objections
lodged
by
the
prosecutor
when
the
defense
counsel
tried
to
bring
out
the
fact
that
this
young
man
minded
his
mother,
that
he
was
always
good
to
his
family.
and
despite
repeated
objections
and
many
times
being
sustained,
defense
counsel
persisted
in
bringing
those
factors
in
front
of
the
jury,
and
did
and
was
able
to
do
so.
when
he
went
into
sentencing,
no
objection
was
raised,
the
judge
did
not
attempt
to
limit
consideration,
and
once
again
he
pounded
on
those
non-statutory
aggravating
factors.
mr.
sean
daly
at
trial
level,
to
the
relevance
at
that
point
in
time
to
these
factors,
it
was,
an
objection
was
in
fact
sustained.
at
other
times,
objections
were
overruled
based
upon
a
relevancy
determination.
but
none
of
these
were
raised
in
the
context
of
the
sentencing.
they
were
raised
in
the
context
of
the
trial
phase
itself.
but
of
course,
defense
counsel
did
not
limit
the
jury's
consideration
of
these
factors
at
sentencing
to
only
those
he
presented.
he
simply
used
hitchcock's
brother
to
present
the
icing
on
the
cake,
then
referred
back
to
all
of
the
other
factors
that
had
been
brought
out.
and
as
conceded
by
the
petitioner,
if
you
look
at
those
factors
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
place
them
within
any
of
the
statutory
circumstances.
they
are
in
fact
non-statutory
mitigating
factors.
they
are
pleas
that
this
man
can
be
rehabilitated,
that
there
are
other
circumstances
that
you
don't
know
about:
he
came
from
a
poor
sharecropper's
family.
all
of
these
other
things
are
of
no
consequence
under
florida's
statutory
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstance
scheme.
they
are
surely
non-statutory
factors,
and
the
jury
was
made
aware
of
them
and
the
defense
counsel
specifically
argued
to
them:
listen,
you've
got
to
look
at
the
whole
picture.
and
there
was
no
objection
raised
to
that.
and
we
submit
that
that,
in
the
context
of
the
jury
instructions
that
seem
to
give
this
court
question,
should
be
enough
to
demonstrate
that
this
man
was
not
deprived
of
an
individualized
sentencing
determination.
he
got
it.
he
brought
out
virtually
everything
that
he
says
now
he
wished
he
could
bring
out.
if
you
look
at
what
defense
counsel
said
in
his
affidavit,
he
doesn't
say
he
would
have
done
anything
differently.
he
doesn't
even
say
that,
i
didn't
think
that
i
could
bring
these
out.
my
opinion
now
reviewing
the
record
is
that
perceive
that
i
may
have
felt
myself
limited.
mr.
sean
daly
it
is
basically
a
harmless
error
argument.
mr.
sean
daly
no,
i
don't.
mr.
sean
daly
i
submit
that
in
the
context
of
this
lockett
case
that
the
case
by
case
analysis
adopted
by
the
eleventh
circuit
is
adequate
to
determine
whether
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
called
for
in
the
post-conviction
context.
the
context
of
this
case
is
truly
an
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
case.
we
have
an
excuse
for
counsel
raised
and,
alternatively
by
the
defendant,
we
certainly
have
the
argument
that
even
if
counsel
knew
that
he
could
present
non-statutory,
he
didn't
do
a
good
enough
job.
but
given
that
context,
we
submit
that
the
standard
of
review
is
a
two-stage
standard.
let
us
assume
that
there
is
error.
then
we
must
go
and
say,
did
it
determine
or
affect
probably
the
outcome
of
this
case?
that
is
truly
what
this
case
is
all
about.
it's
just
ineffective
assistance
under
another
cloak.
mr.
sean
daly
it
still
lies
with
the
petitioner,
given
the
post-conviction
context
and
given
the
challenge
to
the
efficiency
of
counsel.
as
counsel...
as
this
court
has
noted,
there
wasn't
any
objection.
if
you
read
the
petitioner's
brief
in
this
case,
he's
going
to
say
that
everyone
should
have
known
that
florida
limited
consideration
of
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
when
they
read
the
statute,
when
the
dixon
decision
came
out.
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
why
didn't
counsel
know
that
in
this
case?
he
doesn't
say
he
knew
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
doesn't
tell
us
when
this
perception
came
up.
mr.
sean
daly
oh,
very
true.
mr.
sean
daly
and
they
weren't
argued
as
a
basis
for--
mr.
sean
daly
--that's
true.
mr.
sean
daly
and
no
argument--
mr.
sean
daly
--well,
we'd
also
note
that
no
argument--
mr.
sean
daly
--if
you
look
in
this
case,
you're
also
going
to
note
that
the
prosecutor
never
argued
any
of
these
extraneous
facts
as
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstances
at
the
sentencing
phase,
nor
did
he
in
his
responsive
argument
at
sentencing
say,
listen,
you've
all
heard
this
other
stuff,
you
can't
consider
that,
that's
non-statutory
mitigating
evidence
and
you
can't
consider
it.
the
jury
was
never
told
that.
the
jury
was
instead
told
by
defense
counsel,
without
objection
and
without
limitation,
that--
mr.
sean
daly
--i
don't
believe
that
the
instruction
limited
them.
addressing,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
the
second
point,
the
state
of
florida
submits
that
this
case
is
of
monumental
importance
both
in
the
state
of
florida
and
in
other
states
that
now
have
a
capital
sentencing
structure.
what
it
basically
amounts
to
is
a
challenge
or
an
indictment
of
the
system
as
a
whole,
where
the
defendant
seeks
to
come
in
and,
without
specifying
where
the
erroneous,
invidious
prejudice
exists,
simply
wants
to
shut
down
the
system
and
say,
well,
in
ten
more
years,
maybe
in
15
years,
we'll
start
it
up
again,
and
after
we
have
the
requisite
number
of
cases
for
a
statistical
analysis
we'll
go
back
in
and
see
if
society
is
still,
you
know,
devaluing
the
life
of...
the
value
of
the
life
of
black
victims.
if
you
look
at
the
statistical
analysis
in
this
case,
it
does
not
even
attempt
to
rise
to
the
level
of
the
baldus
study.
it
simply
asserts
that,
well,
we've
got
a
lot
of
data
here
from
all
homicide
cases.
this
is
every
case
in
which
a
death
has
resulted.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
first
degree
murder
case.
and
we
submit
to
you
that,
based
upon
those
statistics,
without
any
attempt
to
control
for
a
multitude
of
variables
inherent
in
any
individualized
capital
sentencing
scheme,
that
you
must
through
out
the
statute
as
a
whole,
because
we
don't
know
where
this
discrimination
takes
place.
if
you
look
at
the
gross
and
morrow
study,
which
is
the
cornerstone
upon
which
the
petitioner's
argument
is
base,
you're
going
to
find
that,
as
far
as
the
statisticians
in
that
case
are
concerned,
they
cannot
pinpoint
any
area
in
which
this
discrimination
is
taking
place.
they
seem
to
submit,
though,
that
it
is
in
the
jury
area.
the
jury,
which
is
the
foundation
of
our
criminal
justice
system,
we
must
basically
do
away
with
because
we
cannot
trust
our
citizens
to
not
discriminate
in
sentencing,
despite
what
this
court
has
already
noted
are
very
specific
instructions
on
how
you're
supposed
to
do
it,
instructions
which
include
in
florida
at
least
the
idea
that
you
do
not
consider
prejudice
or
other
aspects
in
sentencing.
mr.
sean
daly
it
certainly
will,
sir.
the
state
of
florida's
position
is
that
we
would
like
to
see
a
bright
line
rule
adopted
by
this
court,
a
basic
finding
that
in
the
regression
analysis,
statistics
analysis
test,
it
cannot
serve
as
a
basis
for
even
the
granting
of
an
evidentiary
hearing,
because
this
situation,
as
noted
by
counsel
for
the
state
of
georgia,
is
inherently
different
from
a
title
7
case
or
a
jury
construction
case.
mr.
sean
daly
it's
certainly
different
in
that
the
florida
scheme
is
different,
in
that
the
florida
scheme
does
not
follow
the
jury's
recommendation
to
have
a
judge
involved.
but
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
the
study,
that's
the
most
important
analysis.
the
study
in
this
case
would
be
considered
feeble,
i
would
submit,
in
comparison
to
the
baldus
study.
they
control
for
only
a
few
factors.
mr.
sean
daly
yes,
sir,
exactly.
mr.
sean
daly
this
type
of
regression
analysis
in
the
capital
sentencing
context
cannot
work.
the
reason
it
cannot
work
is
because
we
cannot
have
mandatory
death
penalty
sentencing,
and
the
reason
we
can't
have
that
is
because
we
must
have
discretion
inherent
in
the
system.
that
discretion,
that
possibility...
the
first
issue
in
this
case
is
the
reason
why
you
can't
have
a
statistical
analysis.
mr.
sean
daly
that's
exactly
right.
and
of
course,
the
state
of
florida
has
been
working
for
more
than
ten
years
under
the
assumption
that
we
can
expend
the
dollars
and
the
time
in
trying
to
implement
our
system
and
not
have
the
rug
pulled
out
from
underneath
us
by
statisticians
down
the
road
who
cannot
control,
who
admit
that
they
cannot
control,
for
all
of
the
inherent
variables
in
the
capital
sentencing
context.
mr.
sean
daly
not
in
this
context.
i
think
they
have
no
value,
because
they
cannot
do
what
they
say
they
have
to
do.
they
cannot
control
adequately
enough
to
tell
us
that
this
system
is
discriminating,
and
they
can
offer
us
no
way
to
adjust
the
system.
if
you
look
at
the
gross
and
morrow
study,
the
only
remedy
that
the
statisticians
can
offer
is
that,
well,
we'll
just
have
to
wait
for
time
to
correct
this
invidious
societal
discrimination,
or
do
away
with
juries,
one
or
the
other,
because
we
cannot
correct.
the
state
submits
that
the
potential
prejudice
that
they
argue
exists
can
be
corrected,
very
simply.
it's
a
mechanism
that
already
exists.
if
it's
a
jury
problem,
why
are
not
defense
counsel
asking
jurors?
now,
admittedly
this
is
a
strange
case
to
do
it
in
because
you
have
a
white
defendant
who
kills
a
13
year
old...
his
13
year
old
white
step-niece
after
raping
her.
and
for
some
reasons,
we
must
invalidate
a
death
penalty
sentence
that
has
been
imposed
by
the
jury
in
accordance
with
florida
law
and
the
judge,
because
if
that
had
been
a
black
victim
somehow
they
would
have
given
life?
we
submit
that
that's
a
preposterous
rationale,
and
that--
mr.
sean
daly
--i
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
sean
daly
i
just
know
now
that
this
court--
mr.
sean
daly
--of
course,
that's
not
the
case
in
the
state
of
florida
now.
mr.
sean
daly
i
understand.
the
basic
analysis
that
we
have
here
is
that
we
have
come
a
long
way
since
then,
and
we
have
a
statute
that
this
court
has
specifically
validated
against
claims
of
arbitrariness
and
discrimination
in
application.
we
have
a
situation
where
we
cannot
control
who
our
murderers
murder.
we
cannot
control
how
our
jurors
think,
although
the
potential
is
certainly
there
for
defense
counsel,
if
he
perceives
a
societal
prejudice
in
the
state
of
florida,
to
question
potential
jurors
on
that
prejudice.
he
questions
them
on
a
potential
prejudice
against
a
black
defendant.
why
cannot
he
do
that
in
this
case?
mr.
sean
daly
well,
prosecutors,
we
submit--
mr.
sean
daly
--well,
they
make
the
decision
of
whether
to
present
it
for
indictment,
certainly.
but
we
have
only
indictment
for
first
degree
murder
in--
mr.
sean
daly
--yes,
there
is
that
discretion.
mr.
sean
daly
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
sean
daly
uncontrolled.
well,
of
course.
he
has
to
evaluate
the
evidence.
mr.
sean
daly
right.
and
that
is
why
we
cannot
conduct
this
type
of
analysis
in
this
case,
unless
you
are
going
to
send
someone
into
every
case,
someone
that
both
people
agree
will
do
an
adequate
job
in
evaluating
the
case,
and
can,
you
know,
basically
compare
apples
to
oranges.
how
do
you
compare
the
mitigating
factor
of
hitchcock's
sucking
gas
to
the
mitigating
factor
of
someone
else's
potential
mental
incapacity?
you
can't.
how
do
you
do
that?
how
do
we
know
how
the
jury
did
it?
we
cannot
do
that.
we
have
to
basically
rely
on
our
jury
system,
and
on
a
system--
mr.
sean
daly
--they
certainly
can
assume
that.
mr.
sean
daly
well,
one
of
the
aspects--
mr.
sean
daly
--the
reason
is
because
you're
making
a
basic
attack
on
the
punishment
system
in
the
state.
mr.
sean
daly
i
submit
that
that's
exactly
true.
this
is...
i
mean,
you
cannot
do
it,
and
that's
why
we
suggest
that
a
bright
line
rule
is
necessary,
to
prevent--
mr.
sean
daly
--i'm
sure
that's
true.
i'm
sure
that
in
specific
cases--
mr.
sean
daly
--i'm
sure
in
specific--
mr.
sean
daly
--no,
sir.
mr.
sean
daly
i
submit
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
condemn
the
system
as
a
whole.
if
a
defendant
wishes
to
come
in
here
and
claim
that
in
his
particular
case
he
has
suffered
intentional
and
purposeful
discrimination
because
of
his
particular
jury
or
his
particular
prosecutor,
he
is
certainly
free
to
make
those
allegations
and
present
the
proof
necessary
to
require
an
evidentiary
hearing.
but
for
mr.
hitchcock
in
this
case
to
come
in
and
say,
well,
i'm
not
saying
i
don't
deserve
my
penalty,
but
you
can't
execute
me
because
someone
else
might
have
gotten
more
lenient
treatment
for
killing
a
black,
when
there
is
no
way
to
qualitatively
compare
the
circumstances
in
those
two
cases,
it
cannot
be
done.
and
there
is
no
way
to
correct
the
system
in
this
case.
if
you
create...
you
are
basically
going
to
create
a
quagmire
of
evidentiary
hearings
where
the
bottom
line
is
always
going
to
be,
as
it
was
in
spinkellink...
the
florida
courts
have
addressed,
at
least
partially
in
spinkellink,
an
analysis
of
evidentiary
admissions.
and
at
that
point
in
time,
the
state
presented
evidence
that,
just
as
the
state
of
georgia
submitted,
that
typically
the
black
victim
situations
are
barroom
brawls
or
quarrels
or
perhaps
mutual
combatant
situations.
mr.
sean
daly
i
believe
so.
if
on
its
face
there
was
a
discriminatory
impact,
certainly
i
think
that
the
challenge
could
be
made.
the
situation
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
that
the
state
of
florida
was
informed
in
1976:
go
ahead,
you
have
a
fine
system;
you
have
a
number
of
checks
and
balances,
for
instance,
that
the
georgia
courts
do
not
have
inherent
in
their
system.
in
order
for
a
discriminatory
impact
to
have
taken
place
in
our
state,
it
has
to
go
not
only
through
the
trial
court
level,
but
also
through
a
mandated
direct
appeal
and
a
proportionality
review
that
is
not
even
required
under
the
constitution.
basically,
the
state
of
florida
bends
over
backwards
to
assure
the
propriety
of
its
system.
and
we
submit
that
this
kind
of
attack
is
basically
untenable,
and
that
the
trial
court,
the
district
court,
and
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
properly
rejected
it
on
a
matter
of
law
determination
saying,
listen,
that
might
be
fine
in
title
7
cases,
that
might
be
fine
in
limited
criminal
aspects,
but
in
the
context
of
a
death
penalty
case
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
is
mandated
and
you
cannot
control
for
that
discretion.
the
system
must
survive
until
it
is
demonstrated
beyond
a
doubt
and
beyond
a
situation
that
the
statistical
analysis
is
going
to
be
able
to
do,
that
it
has
an
intentional
discriminatory
impact.
hitchcock
doesn't
even
assert
that
there
is
any
intentional
discrimination
on
behalf
of
the
state
in
this
case.
he
simply
wishes
to
take
advantage
of
a
statistical,
an
alleged
statistical
disparity
which
is
not
totally
explained.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
