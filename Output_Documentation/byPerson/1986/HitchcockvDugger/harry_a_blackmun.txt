mr.
barnard,
how
many
florida
inmates
are
in
the
same
position
as
hitchcock?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
roughly
how
many?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
roughly--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--roughly
in
the
twenties,
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
of
course
came
down
after
hitchcock's
sentence,
didn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
what
we
do
in
the
mccleskey
case
will
affect
what
we
do
here
on
this
issue,
won't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
think
your
case
is
any
different
and,
if
so,
in
what
respects
from
the
georgia
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
any
study
isn't
going
to
be
very--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--so
statistics
should
be
thrown
out
completely?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
some
states
thought
for
a
while
they
could
have
mandatory
death
penalties.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
like
statisticians.
