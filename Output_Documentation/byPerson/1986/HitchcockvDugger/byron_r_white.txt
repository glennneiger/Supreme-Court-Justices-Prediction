justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
the
jury's
role
is
advisory
in
florida
and
if
it
turned
out
that
the
judge
in
imposing
the
death
penalty
had
said,
i
am
considering
all
the
mitigating
evidence
that
there
is,
i'm
not
sure
his
instruction
to
the
jury
would
be
very
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
it
certainly
isn't.
you
do
have
to
get
around...
and
i
think
your
habeas
corpus
petition
did
allege
very
clearly
that
the
judge
himself
did
not
consider
any
but
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
with
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
they
locked
at
the
facts
and
said,
well,
all
the...
there's
no
proof
that
anything
else
would
ever
have
come
out?
isn't
that
what
they
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
so
they
concluded
that
your
client
wasn't
denied
an
individualized
sentencing
hearing,
just
on
their
analysis
of
what
happened
and
what
your
proof
was
or
allegations
at
the
habeas
hearing.
what
do
you
do
with
that,
just
say
they're
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
they
said
that
after
reading
your
habeas
corpus
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
said
that
there
was
a
failure
to
indicate
how
things
would
have
been
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
to
reverse
we
have
to
say
they
were
just
wrong
in
reading
the
record
in
the
habeas
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
you're
right
that
the
statute
shouldn't
be
declared
unconstitutional,
the
issue
is
about
the
constitutionality
of
this
particular
death
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
agree
that
the
trial
judge
limited
his
consideration
to
just
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
his
instruction
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
argument
by
defense
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
same
kind
of
an
argument
made
or
arise
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
find
it
very
strange
that
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
on
this
phase
of
the
case
didn't
even
mention
what
the
trial
court's
instruction
was
to
the
jury,
to
the
jury
or
what
he
considered
himself
in
imposing
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
the
prior...
in
the
prior
hitchcock
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
that
there
is
just
no
argument
whatsoever
that
the
judge
plainly
told
the
jury:
you
may
consider
these
five
mitigating
circumstances
and
no
others,
and
in
your
balancing
aggravation,
aggravating
circumstances,
against
mitigating,
you
just
must
consider
these
five
mitigating
and
no
others.
and
then
the
jury
comes
back
with
a
recommendation,
and
then
the
judge
himself
decides,
proceeds
to
decide
whether
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
and
he
specifically
says:
i
am
limiting
my
consideration
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
to
the
following.
now,
if
that
happened
in
this
case
wouldn't
you
say
that's
a
real
problem
under
lockett?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
should
we
reverse.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
if
we
interpret
what
happened
in
this
case
that
way,
then
there's'
going
to
be
a
reversal.
i
know
you
don't
agree
with
that
interpretation.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
your
only
defense
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision?
because
they
said...
well,
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
said,
well,
it's
perfectly
plain
that
if
this
lawyer
or
judge
hadn't
been
mistaken
that
they
would
have
been
a
lot
of
other
mitigating
circumstances
that
could
have
been
presented?
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
thought
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
their
rationale
was
there's
no
proof
here
that
any
different...
that
there
would
have
been
any
different
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
had
thought
there
would
have
been
different
evidence?
what
would
they
have
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
the
problem
is
is
that
what
the
judge
heard
were
a
lot
of
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
that
he
didn't
consider.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
a
case
of
agreeing
or
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
their
interpretation
of
what
the
judge
said
and
what
the
defense
attorney
believed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
even
addressed
it
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
a
case
by
case
analysis.
why
didn't
they?
if
they
had
found
that
the
judge
just
plain
out
said,
i
can't
possibly
consider
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
they
would
have
reversed.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
harmless
error,
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
there
was
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
harmless?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
agree
that
in
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial
there
were
a
lot
of
facts
brought
out
about
this
petitioner?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
lot
of
them
aren't
listed
in
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
yet
the
jury
was
told,
don't
consider
any
except
a,
b,
c,
and
d.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
forget
all
the
mitigating
circumstances
that
you
might
have
heard
in
the
guilt
phase.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
sort
of,
it's
really
no
complete
answer
to
say
that
the
lawyer
might
not
have
offered
anything
more
than
he
did.
he
might
have
already
offered
a
lot
of
things
or
there
might
have
been
a
lot
of
facts
in
the
case
that
the
jury
and
the
judge
might
not
have
considered
in
mitigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
are
they
going
to
do,
disobey
their
instructions
from
the
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
prosecutors?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
make
a
decision
of
whether
to
make
a
capital
case
out
of
a
set
of
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about,
is
there
some
choice
made
after
the
finding
of
guilt
as
to
whether
to
proceed
to
a
sentencing
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
prosecutor?
justice
byron
r.
white
uncontrolled?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
to
evaluate
the
evidence.
