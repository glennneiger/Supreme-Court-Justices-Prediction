mr.
barnard,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barnard,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case
i
think
made
a
finding
that
the
state
of
florida
law
at
that
time
on
whether
you
could
introduce
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
was
ambiguous.
do
you
disagree
with
that
or
do
you
think
i'm
incorrect
in
saying
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
agree
that
the
eleventh
circuit
said
it,
but
you
disagree
with
the
eleventh
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily,
of
course,
we
take
the
view
of
a
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
law
of
a
state
in
which
that
court
sits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
that
isn't
the
key,
as
you
put
it,
to
the
constitutional
question,
what
is
the
key
to
the
constitutional
question?
i
mean,
if
one
were
to
show
that
a
defense
attorney
had
gotten
in
all
the
evidence
that
he
wanted
to
get
in,
would
it
make
much
difference
what
the
state
supreme
court
said
the
trial
court
might
have
excluded
if
the
trial
court
didn't
exclude
anything?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barnard,
did
the
eleventh
circuit
majority
opinion
treat
your
assertion
that
the
trial
judge
had
charged
the
jury
that
they
might
not
consider
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
denial
of
individualized
consideration
is
quite
general,
as
opposed
to
claiming
that
the
trial
judge
charged
the
jury
that
it
might
not
consider
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
barnard.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
daly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
daly.
the
case
is
submitted.
