justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
barnard,
in
this
case
i
take
it
the
defense
counsel
did
offer
mitigating
evidence
that
went
beyond
the
purely
statutory
mitigating
factors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
is
a
reviewing
court
to
determine
whether
other
mitigating
evidence
would
have
been
obtained
or
offered?
how
would
we
ever
know
as
a
reviewing
court
anything
like
that?
because
the
attorney
clearly
didn't
feel
restricted
at
the
time,
having
introduced
some
evidence
that
went
beyond
the
mitigating
factors.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
daly,
shouldn't
we
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
instruction,
as
any
juror
would
be
expected
to
do?
and
when
the
trial
judge
himself
was
sentencing
the
petitioner,
he
only
discussed
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances
and
stated
there
were
insufficient
mitigating
circumstances
as
enumerated
in
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
doesn't
that
at
least
suggest
that
the
judge
didn't
think
consideration
of
other
factors
was
appropriate?
