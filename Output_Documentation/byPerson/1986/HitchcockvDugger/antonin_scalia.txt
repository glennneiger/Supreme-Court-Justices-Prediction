justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
barnard,
your
contention
here
is
that
it
wasn't
introduced
effectively;
it
was
introduced,
but
that
the
judge
told
the
jury
they
couldn't
consider
it.
isn't
that
your
contention?
justice
antonin
scalia
aren't
you
relying
on
the
statement
of
the
judge
that
they
could
only
consider
the
identified
mitigating
factors?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
effect,
everything
the
lawyer
had
said
was
washed
out
by
the
judge,
just
as
though
he
had
given
the
jury
an
instruction
to
disregard
it.
so
your
contention
is
that
it
didn't
get
in
for
any
effective
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
judge
here
said
it
couldn't
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
assume
that
the
statute
was,
or
the
operation
of
the
statute
was
vague,
as
the
state
claims.
if
we
should
agree
with
that,
there
there'd
be
a
difference
between
a
case
in
which
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
it
could
only
consider
the
statutory
factors
and
a
case
in
which
a
judge
gave
no
such
instruction
and
the
lawyer
argued
other
factors.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
barnard,
was
there
any
objection
made
to
the
instruction
to
the
sentencing
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
nor
to
the
statement
that
the
judge
made
when
he
imposed
the
sentence
that
he
was
limiting
it
to
the
mitigating
factors?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
you
say,
mr.
barnard.
i
think
what
you
say
is
that
you
don't
need
proof
that
anything
more
would
have
come
in.
your
basic
complaint
is
that
what
did
come
in
was
taken
away
from
the
consideration
of
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
you
can't
prove
that
anything
more
would
have
come
in,
those
statements
about
mitigating
factors
that
the
attorney
made
were
not
allowed
to
be
considered
by
the
jury.
so
even
if
you
couldn't
prove
any
more,
you'd
still
have
a
case,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
he
said.
he
said
the
mitigating
circumstances
which
you
may
consider
shall
be
the
following.
i
take
that
to
mean
these
are
the
only
mitigating
circumstances
that
you
may
consider.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
perhaps,
but
i
consider
that
specific
enough:
"the
mitigating
circumstances
which
you
may
consider
shall
be
the
following.
"
not
included
among
the
mitigating
factors,
or
you
may
consider
the
following
mitigating
factors.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
daly,
the
charge
to
the
jury
also
said,
in
addition
to
saying
the
mitigating
circumstances
you
may
consider
shall
be
the
following
and
then
listing
the
statutory
list,
the
judge
went
on
to
say
later:
after
you've
considered
all
the
aggravating
circumstances,
then
you
are
to
consider
the
mitigating
circumstances
and
consider
them
by
number.
now,
what
do
you
think
"by
number"
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
non-statutory
ones
that
you
say
they
were
free
to
consider?
they
consider
them
number
zero?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
you
have
that
indicates
that
this
language
doesn't
mean
what
it
seems
to
me
it
says,
other
than
the
fact
that
non-statutory
mitigating
elements
were
allowed
to
be
referred
to
by
the
defense
counsel?
is
there
anything
else
in
the
charge
to
the
jury
that
specifically
makes
clear
they
can
consider
these
mitigating
factors,
or
is
there
anything
in
the
judge's
statement
when
he
imposed
the
sentence
that
indicated
that
he
did
consider
those
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
an
objection
ever
raised
and
overruled?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
the
statistician's
answer
to
that
is
that
all
those
variables
will
likely
break
out
even.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
where
you
have
a
statistical
result
that
is
wildly
disparate,
you
can
come
to
the
conclusion
there's
something
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you
can't
take
account
of
all
the
factors,
but
why
shouldn't
you
assume
that
all
the
factors
you
can't
take
account
of
more
or
less
even
out?
at
least
you
don't
end
up
with
a
result
eleven
times
different,
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
hitchhock
versus
duggers
comes
to
us
from
the
eleventh
circuit.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder.
at
his
sentencing
hearing,
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
advisory
jury
not
to
consider
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances
not
specifically
enumerated
in
the
florida
death
penalty
statue.
the
trial
judge
also
refused
to
consider
such
evidence
himself.
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
death.
following
unsuccessful
appeals
in
state
and
federal
collateral
proceedings,
petitioner
applied
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
district
court,
claiming
that
his
sentence
was
invalid
because
the
advisory
jury
and
the
sentencing
judge
had
not
considered
evidence
of
non
statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
the
district
court
denied
the
application
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
death
in
proceedings
that
did
not
comport
with
the
requirement
of
our
cases
that
the
capital
sentencing
authority
may
neither
refuse
to
consider
nor
be
precluded
from
considering
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
petitioner's
death
sentence
must
be
vacated.
the
case
is
remanded
and
the
district
court
is
to
be
instructed
to
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
unless
the
state
lawfully
re-sentences
petitioner
within
a
reasonable
time.
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous.
