mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent's
claim
for
attorney's
fees
fails,
on
our
view,
for
two
principal
reasons.
first,
their
claim
misapprehends
the
role
of
private
enforcement
in
title
vi.
because
of
title
vi's
inherently
consensual
basis,
congress
fashioned
an
administrative
enforcement
scheme
for
title
vi
different
than
that
provided
for
in
other
civil
rights
laws,
such
as
title
vii.
to
best
achieve
the
purposes
of
title
vi,
congress
chose
not
to
confer
upon
persons
claiming
discrimination
the
status
as
parties
in
the
administrative
enforcement
scheme;
and
consequently,
section
1988
does
not
apply
to
their
activities
in
that
setting.
the
second
defect
in
respondent's
claim
is
that
it
rests
on
an
unduly
expansion
construction
of
the
term
1988.
they
claim
that
agency
investigations
and
informal
negotiations
urged
on
by
the
federal
agency
constitute
proceedings
to
enforce
title
vi
within
the
meaning
of
section
1988.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
such
an
expansive
meaning
for
the
term.
of
the
two
defects
in
respondent's
claim,
the
more
troubling
to
the
united
states
is
the
first.
and
that
is,
their
misapprehension
of
the
role
of
private
enforcement
in
title
vi.
title
vi's
nondiscrimination
mandate
is
uncompromising,
yet
simultaneously,
it's
fragile.
it
depends,
therefore,
for
its
ultimate
accomplishment,
on
the
maintenance
of
a
bilateral
relationship
between
the
federal
agency
and
the
recipient
of
federal
funds.
unless
that
relationship
remains
intact,
title
vi's
nondiscrimination
mandate
is
frustrated
and
becomes
meaningless.
we
believe
for
this
reason
congress
established
an
administrative
enforcement
scheme
in
title
vi
notable
in
two
primary
respects:
first,
the
lack
of
party
status
for
persons
claiming
discrimination;
and
second,
a
heavy
dependence
on
voluntary
means
of
resolving
charges
of
discrimination
as
reflected
in
the
statutory
language,
42
usc
2000d-1,
which
refers
to
the
words
of
voluntary
meanings
of
resolution.
we
think
that
application
of
section
1988
would
undermine
the
congressional
scheme.
federal
recipients
might
be
less
likely
to
participate
in
the
informal
process.
or,
even
if
they
were
willing
to
participate,
less
willing
to
compromise
their
position,
for
fear
of
opening
themselves
up
to
liability
for
attorneys'
fees.
sure,
in
other
settings,
it
might
be
said
that
the
threat
of
imposition
of
attorneys'
fees
might
promote
settlement.
but
in
title
vi,
it
also
increases
the
chances
that
the
recipient
will
circumvent,
indeed,
frustrate
title
vi's
mandate
by
decline
of
receipt
of
federal
funds.
indeed,
the
absence
of
attorneys'
fees
in
the
informal
process
encourages
the
recipient
to
settle
a
case
in
that
process
rather
than
waiting.
the
balance,
we
agree,
is
a
difficult
one
to
strike.
we
believe
the
language
and
structure
of
title
vi,
in
602
and
603
of
the
statute,
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
err
on
the
side
of
informality,
at
least
in
the
initial
stages
of
agency
enforcement.
congress
determined,
we
believe
the
language
reflects,
in
contrast
to
title
vii,
congress
determined
that
a
more
formal
role
for
respondents,
persons
claiming
discrimination
in
an
administrative
setting,
would
impeded
and
not
further.
in
effect,
congress
erected
a
safe
harbour
within
title
vi
to
allow
for
the
promotion
of
voluntary
settlement
in
informal
negotiations.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
they
might
be.
the
analysis
would
change.
they
would
not
automatically
be
entitled,
because
those
activities
would
not
have
occurred
in
a
proceeding
to
enforce.
but
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
extent
that
the
effort
they
spent
in
those
activities
was
reasonably
expended
on
the
litigation.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
precisely.
under
the
second
half
of
the
holding
in
webb.
essentially
looking
for
the
incorporation--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--we
don't
think
so.
because
there's
no
clear
incentive
to
just
file
a
preemptive
lawsuit
at
the
outset.
for
instance,
in
this
case,
if
a
lawsuit
had
been
filed
at
the
outset,
at
the
same
time
the
administrative
complaint
had
been
filed,
under
our
analysis
they
still
would
not
be
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees.
filing
a
lawsuit
changes
the
analysis,
but
it
wouldn't
change
the
result.
you
would
still
have
to
look
to
see
whether
the
lawsuit
was
the
catalyst
for
the
agreement
reached.
in
this
case,
the
catalyst
for
the
agreement
reached
was
the
administrative
process,
and
would
not
have
been
a
lawsuit.
so
absent
an
incentive
to
just
go
ahead
and
file
a
preemptive
lawsuit,
because
it
wouldn't
change
the
result,
we
don't
believe
that
people
would
necessarily
file
those
lawsuits.
and
if
they
did,
they
would
be
going
against,
in
certain
respects,
the
best
interests
of
their
client,
which
would
be
to
participate
in
the
informal
administrative
process,
and
to
achieve,
as
respondents
did
in
this
case,
an
agency
preliminary
finding
of
reasonable
cause,
which
no
doubt
helped
considerably
in
the
negotiation
process.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
encourage...
to
use
the
administrative
process...
provided
them
with
relief.
and
that
is
ultimately
what
i
presume
that
they're
seeking.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
attorneys'
fees
are
only
necessary...
entitled
in
the
congressional
scheme...
congress
could
have
passed
a
statute,
section
1988,
a
rule
which
said
that
whenever
you
do
anything
which
modifies
the
behavior
of
another
in
a
manner
which
furthers
the
policies
of
title
vi,
you're
entitled
to
fees;
but
they
drew
a
line.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
and
here
it
drew
a
line,
and
it
required
that
there
be
an
action
or
proceeding
to
which
the
person
complaining
of
discrimination--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
we
believe
it
is
not
a
proceeding.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
here,
it
was
merely
an
informal
process
within
the
agency.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it's
not
a
proceeding
to
which
they
were
a
party.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
section
1988
says
that
there
has
to
be--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
in
order
for
us
to
prevail,
you
have
to
find
that
they
were
not...
it
was
not
a
proceeding
to
enforce
title
vi
with
which...
in
which
they
were
a
party
that
prevailed.
and
we
do
not
believe
they
were
a
party.
and
we
also
do
not
believe
it's
a
proceeding.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
reserving
time
for
mr.
thornburg's
remarks.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
a
proceeding,
in
our
view,
within
1988,
would
require
more
indicia
of
formality,
such
as
an
adjudicatory
proceeding.
he
would
believe
that
in
title
vi
there
is
one
activity
which
constitutes
a
proceeding,
and
that
is,
the
adjudicatory
proceeding
between
the
federal
agency
and
the
recipients
if
the
federal
agency
is
considering
the
cutoff
of
federal
funds.
of
course,
under
the
statute
and
implementing
regulations,
the
respondents
would
not
have
been
a
party
to
that
proceeding,
which
confirms--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--it
requires
more
indicia
of
formality.
such
as
a
hearing
with
witness,
adjudicatory
hearing.
i
think
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
provides
a
good
touchstone
to
what
would
be
a
proceeding.
the
recipient
is
entitled
to
some
notice
that
it
is
now
participating
in
a
setting
where
the
controversy
has
reached,
we
believe,
a
sufficient
stage
of
concreteness,
that
attorneys'
fees
may
be
liable.
at
some
level,
it's
a
matter
of
fairness.
and
we
believe
congress
drew
the
line.
