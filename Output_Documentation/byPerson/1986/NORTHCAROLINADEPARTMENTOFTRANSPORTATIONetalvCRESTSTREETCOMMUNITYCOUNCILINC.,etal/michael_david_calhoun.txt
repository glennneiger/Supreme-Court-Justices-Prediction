mr.
michael
david
calhoun
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1988
provides
for
prevailing
party
to
recover
attorney's
fees
in,
quote,
any
action
or
proceeding,
end
quote,
to
enforce
a
provision
of
one
of
the
laws
specified
in
section
1988.
in
particular,
title
vi
is
one
of
the
laws
particularly
set
out
in
section
1988.
plaintiffs
in
this
case
sought,
and
recovered
on
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals
below,
fees
for
representation
in
a
federal
administrative
proceeding,
and
a
related
court
action,
in
which
they
did
enforce
their
rights
under
title
vi.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
first
of
all,
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
the
question.
the
defendants
in
this
case
have
argued
that
the
statutory
language
saying
that
the
court
is
to
make
the
award
of
the
fees
indicates
an
intent
by
congress
to
exclude
fees
for
administrative
proceedings.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
this
same
issue
came
up
in
the
case
of
new
york
gaslight
company
v.
carey,
where
the
issue
was,
can
you
get
fees
in
an
independent
action
to
recover
fees?
and
there
the
court
explicitly
stated
that
it
would
be
utterly
anomalous,
and
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress,
to
say
that
if
you
go
through
the
administrative
proceeding
and
you
win
and
then
don't
have
to
go
to
court,
you
get
no
fees;
but
if
you
go
through
the
administrative
proceeding
and
lose
and
have
to
go
to
court,
then
you
can
get
fees.
the
unsuccessful
administrative
complainant
gets
fees,
while
the
successful
one
is
denied
that.
i
would
note
that
the
very
language
regarding
that
was
cited
with
approval
by
this
court
unanimously
in
the
subsequent
case
of
white
v.
the
state
of
new
hampshire
department
of
employment
security.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
in
this
case,
the
threshold
of
formality
was
reached.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
clarify
the
record
of
what
did
happen
here.
when
the
defendants
proposed
this
freeway,
initially
we
did
as
any
counsel
would;
we
informally
approached
them
and
said,
will
you
change
the
design?
will
you
provide
benefits
to
mitigate
the
impact?
after
we
had
contacted
them,
the
record
shows
they
continued
with
the
same
design,
which
would
totally
displace
this
low
income
black
community;
and
in
terms
of
mitigation
efforts,
their
relocation
report,
which
was
attached
to
the
administrative
complaint,
showed
that
there
rehousing
plan
was
to
use
vacancies
that
they
thought
would
exist
in
public
housing
sites
scattered
around
the
city.
that
was
the
starting
point
when
the
administrative
complaint
was
filed
in
september,
1978.
they
cast
the
idea,
and
would
like
you
to
believe,
that
everybody
was
in
agreement.
no
adversarial
position
here.
these
were
extensive
adversarial
proceedings.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
they
issued
a
preliminary
finding
stating
that...
in
effect,
they
issued
a
probable
cause
determination
equivalent
to
that
of--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--they
urged
the
parties
to
conciliate
and
that
the
parties
did--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--no,
the
proceeding
was
determined...
was
terminated
by
the
complaints
withdrawing
their
complaint,
which
was
explicitly
the
quid
pro
quo
in
the
final
settlement
document.
just
as
it's
done
frequently
in
the
eeoc
context.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
the
dot
accepted
the
withdrawal
of
the
complaint
after
the
plaintiffs
and
defendants
entered
into
a
formal
settlement
document.
the
defendants
in
this...
it
applies
both
to
the
court
and
the
administrative
proceeding...
the
defendants
did...
we
would
have
preferred
as
plaintiffs
to
have
had
the
order...
either
an
order
of
the
court
or
the
agency
to
come
back
for
contempt.
the
defendants
resisted
that,
and
we
agreed
to
their
position,
because
of
the
extensive
duties,
and
complicated
duties,
they
undertook
in
this
mitigation
plan,
which
sets
out
in
some
15
pages--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--it
was,
and
that
they
then
accepted
withdrawal
of
the
complaint
and
termination
of
the
proceeding
upon
execution
of
the
settlement
agreement.
i
think
the
settlement
agreement
reflects...
and
the
whole
negotiations
between
the
parties
reflect...
that
this
settlement
agreement
was
essential
to
ending
the
administrative
proceeding.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
the
parties...
there
were
three
parties...
there
were
three
entities
that
signed
the
settlement
agreement:
the
plaintiffs,
the
defendants,
and
the
city
of
durham.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
it
was
submitted
to
dot
saying,
we
have
reached
this
agreement
and
therefore
we
are
withdrawing
our
complaint,
and
there
was--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--there
was
no
objection,
and
the
complaint
was--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--that's...
no
explicit
approval
in
terms
of--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--yes.
if
they'd
been
allowed
the
complaint
to
be
withdrawn?
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
i
don't
have
experience
in
other
cases
to
know.
but
i
would
say,
this
situation
is
the
same
as
would
occur
in
eeoc
proceedings,
which
this
court
has
held,
you
are
entitled
to
fees
for
administrative
representation.
for
example,
in
the
statutory
scheme
of
eeoc,
north
carolina,
for
example,
is
a
nondeferral
state.
if
this
had
been
in
the
title
vii
context,
it
would
have
proceeded
exactly
the
same
way.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
north
carolina
is
a
nondeferral
state,
so
there
is
approved
state
agency.
so
in
north
carolina
you
would
file
a
complaint
with
the
eeoc,
just
like
we
filed
a
complaint
with
the
dot.
the
essence
of
the
dispute
resolution
would
be
conciliation.
and
they
would
urge
the
parties
to
conciliate.
and
typically...
and
i
have
done
this
myself...
when
there
is
a
successful
agreement,
part
of
the
agreement
is
to
withdraw
the
complaint
from
eeoc,
and
that
is
typically
approved.
but
this
court
has
said,
you
would
get
fees
there.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
yes,
and--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--it
was
part
of
the
reasoning
in
carey,
but
it
was
a
different
issue
in
carey.
in
carey,
the
plaintiff
prevailed
totally
under
state
law.
as
in
carey...
chief
justice,
you
and
justice
white,
dissented,
and
referred
with
approval
to
judge
mulligan's
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals.
his
dissent
there
went
to
the
issue
of,
those
were
not
federal
rights.
just
like
in
webb,
the
proceeding
did
not
concern
federal
rights.
as
justices
blackmun
and
brennan
have
pointed
out
explicitly
in
webb,
the
issue
of
whether
a
proceeding
is
mandatory
or
optional
goes
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
proceeding
under
one
of
the
titles
specified
in
setion
1988.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
a
proceeding.
in
this
case
there
is
no
question
that
this
was
a
proceeding
to
enforce
title
vi.
the
administrative--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--they
would
say,
quote,
it's
not
a
proceeding.
0
xxx.
but
they
would
contest
that
the
purpose
of
what
we
were
doing
was
to
enforce
title
vi.
this
court
has
looked
at,
both
in
webb
and
in
carey,
two
separate
issues.
it's
not:
is
it
a
proceeding?
in
fact,
implicit
in
all
this
court's
decisions
regarding
recovering
fees
for
administrative
representation,
it
has
been
implicit,
and
the
court
has
rejected
on
several
occasions,
the
argument
that
the
word
1988
does
not
include
administrative
proceedings.
in
webb
and
in
carey,
the
issue
was,
was
that
proceeding
one
to
enforce
one
of
the
rights
set
out
in
the
attorney's
fees
statute?
that's
also
shown
by
this
court's
decision
in
robinson...
in
smith
v.
robinson.
that
was
a
case
under
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act.
there
you
found
that
the
proceeding,
the
administrative
proceeding,
was
mandatory.
but
it
was
mandated
by
a
nonfee
statute.
so
even
though
it
was
mandatory,
the
court
held
that
you
could
not
get
fees
for
representation
there.
because
the
issue
was
not,
is
it
optional
or
mandatory;
the
issue
was,
is
it
a
proceeding
to
enforce
the
rights
that
congress
enacted?
and
congress
decided
it
should
be
accompanied
with
an
attorney's
fee
award.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
there
has
to
be
a
threshold
requirement
of
a
proceeding.
and
here--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--it's
the
filing
of
a
complaint.
just
as
the
threshold
in
litigation
is,
between
informally
complaining
to
a
party
and
filing
a
complaint.
the
filing
of
that
complaint
triggered
a
process,
and
it
also
triggered
legal
rights
for
the
complaint.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
yes.
and
the
proceeding
was,
to
investigate,
first
of
all,
and
determine
whether
there
was
probable
cause;
which
they
did.
this
wasn't
a
case
where
we
filed
the
complaint,
and
the
next
day,
they
turned
around
and
changed
their
practices.
quite
to
the
contrary.
a
year
and
a
half
elapsed
between
the
time
we
filed
the
administrative
complaint
and
the
administrative
agency
issued
its
finding
of
a
title
vi
violation.
in
the
interim
the
agency
had
met--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--a
preliminary
finding
of...
they--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--the
wording
used
in
the
letter
sent
certified
mail,
return
receipt
requested,
to
the
secretary
of
the
state
department
of
transportation
was
that
they
made
a
preliminary
finding
that
a
violation
of
title
vi
would
occur
if
the
road
was
built
in
this
manner.
the...
first
of
all,
on
the
proceeding,
the
defendants
are
turning
on
its
head
the
congressional
preference
for
conciliation.
these
points
are
clear:
first,
that
congress
intended,
by
enacting
section
1988,
to
provide
attorney's
fees
to
victims
of
civil
rights
violation;
second,
it
is
also
extremely
clear
from
both
congress
as
this
court
that
there
is
a
strong
preference
for
resolution
or
conciliation.
the
legislative
history
of
1988
specifically
states
that
congress
thought
that
a
fee
claimant
should
not
be
penalized
for
reaching
a
settlement.
it
would
serve
no
public
policy
for...
to
require
a
fee
claimant
to
go
through
a
court
hearing.
the
legislative
history
is
explicit
to
say
that
if,
after
filing
a
complaint,
the
party
changes
its
practices,
that
a
fee
recovery
would
still
be
proper.
congress
has
addressed
this
issue.
so
from
the
two
points
that
congress
intended
for
victims
of
civil
rights
violations
to
recover
fees;
and
second,
that
they
encouraged
and
went
out
of
their
way
to
urge
that
these
disputes
be
conciliated;
how
does
it
follow
that
congress
intended
to
deny
fees
for
conciliation?
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
this
court
considered
that
exact
same
argument
in
carey,
and
rejected
it
under
title
vii--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--in
carey,
i
would
not
that
this
case
is
in
virtually
the
same
position
procedurally
as
carey,
and
as
a
case
cited
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
house
report.
and
in
all
cases,
fees
for
administrative
proceedings
were
granted.
in
carey,
the
party
filed
an
administrative
complaint.
and
then,
near
the
end,
near
the
very
end
of
the
administrative
process,
they
filed
a
federal
court
action.
before
anything
was
done
in
the
federal
court
action,
they
received
all
of
the
relief
that
they
had
asked
for
in
the
administrative
forum.
but
the
issue...
the
substantive
issue
was
resolved
in
the
administrative
forum.
and
this
court
awarded
fees.
and
that
follows.
in
the
house
report
on
section
1988--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--in
gaslight,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
that's
correct.
the
same
thing
happened--
--and
this
court
said
that
a
separate
suit
for
attorney's
fees
was
accepted...
acceptable,
didn't
it,
or
not?
it
did
explicitly
say
that
in
carey.
and
then
it
referred,
in
a
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court
subsequently,
in
the
case
of
white
v.
the
new
hampshire
director
of
employment
security,
it
stated
with
approval,
quoted
from
carey,
an
independent
action
would
be
permitted.
but
even
if
a
related
court
action
is
required,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
this
case,
there
was
such
an
action.
now
the
defendants
have
put
this
gloss
of
friendliness
on
everything.
but
this
was...
we
start
from
very
adversarial
positions.
and
we
end
up,
through
this
process,
at
a
result
far
from
what
defendants
originally
offered.
defendants
started
out
offering
not
to
change
their
plans
and
provide
no
mitigation
plan.
the
final
result
is,
the
defendants
substantially
modified
their
highway
plan,
so
to
preserve
the
community,
and
out
of
pocket
spend
more
than
$5
million
to
improve
this
community
and
mitigate
the
impacts
of
the
road.
the
magnitude
of
that
settlement
indicates
the
strength
of
the
civil
rights
claims
that
we
had
here.
in
terms
of
the
position
of
the
court
proceeding
here
vis-a-vis
the
administrative
proceeding,
we
reached,
in
the
spring
of
1982,
a
framework
for
future
negotiations.
specifically,
the
major
breakthrough
was
the
dot
for
the
first
time
said
they
would
discuss
last-resort
housing.
no
enforceable
agreement
was
entered
until
after
the
court
action
and
the
motion
to
intervene
in
this
case
had
been
filed.
at
the
time
we
moved
to
intervene
into
ecos,
the
plaintiffs
had
no
enforceable
agreement
with
the
defendants.
furthermore,
it
is
clear
that
we
were
parties
to
the
ecos
action.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
the
motion
to
intervene
was
not
explicitly
ruled
on.
but
we
were
made
parties
to
the
final
judgment.
and
among
other
things,
that
final
judgment
dismissed
with
prejudice
our
title
vi
claim.
if
were
parties,
how
could
it
dismiss
with
prejudice
our
claims?
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
i
think
that
may
be
the
label
on
our
signature,
but
it...
the
substance
of
that--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--of
the
order,
of
the
consent
judgment,
explicitly
dismisses
claims
with
prejudice.
and
this
issue
was
clarified,
i
think,
in
the
court
of
appeals
below.
there,
chief
judge
winter
asked
defendants'
counsel,
he
said,
what
if
the
plaintiffs
had
turned
around
the
next
day
and
filed
a
title
vi
court
action?
could
they
do
it?
and
defendants'
counsel,
mr.
richmond,
argued
the
case
there,
said
no.
res
judicata
would
bar
that.
the
only
way
that
we
could
be
barred,
and
the
intent
of
the
agreement
was
to
bar
and
bury
our
claims.
and
it
did
so.
the
only
way
it
can
do
that
is
if
we
were
parties
to
that
action.
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
position
argued
by
defendant
produces
anomalous
results.
first
of
all,
as
mentioned,
they
argue,
if
you
succeed
at
the
administrative
proceeding,
no
fees
whatsoever.
but
if
you
went
to
court
and...
and
without
going
at
all
to
the
administrative
forum,
if
you
went
to
court
and
did
exactly
the
same
thing
as
we
did
here,
you
would
get
fees.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
i
think
at
the
time--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--at
the
time
that
we
filed
the
administrative
complaint,
we
believed
that
there
was
a
substantial
chance
that
it
would
be
found
that
you
had
to
exhaust
that
remedy.
there
were
the
wilmington,
delaware
cases,
other
cases,
that
held,
as
we've
cited
in
the
brief,
that
at
that
time
it
appeared
that
you
might
have
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
this
court,
i
believe,
has
clarified
that
question
since
then.
and
we
would
say,
it
appears
now
that
you
do
not
have
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
under
title
vi.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
this
court,
as
you
know
well,
has
considerably
varying
opinions
on
that
issue.
but
it
does
appear
that
the
court
has
held
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
under
title
vi.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
it
now
appears
that
way,
although
it
appeared
differently
at
the
time
we
filed
the
administrative
complaint.
the--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--i
think
that's
clear.
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
argued
that
somehow
awarding
fees
here
would
cause
an
interference
with
the
agency
enforcement
of
title
vi.
first
of
all,
as
shown
by
title
vii
regulations,
the
agency
has
complete
control
of
these
proceedings
in
terms
of
where
they
head.
and
they
can
prevent
any
interference.
second,
in
this
case
we're
talking
only
about
the
threshold
requirement
of
the
fee
claimant.
getting
over
this
hurdle
doesn't
mean
you're
going
to
recover
all
your
fees
that
you've
requested.
you
still
have
to
show
that
your
fees
are
reasonable,
and
for
work
that
reasonably
contributed
to
the
result.
an
administrative
complaintant
is
simply
not
going
to
burn
time
that
is
not
helping
the
proceeding
because
they
know
they're
never
going
to
get
fees
for
it.
there
is
no
evidence
here
of
any
such
interference.
in
fact,
the
only
evidence
here
is
that
without
the
plaintiffs'
active
involvement,
this
enforcement
of
civil
rights
would
simply
have
never
occurred.
we
also
want
to
clarify
on
the
party
issue
what
our
position
is.
we
don't
say
that
if
you
affirm
this
award
of
attorney's
fees,
that
means
that
every
administrative
claimant
has
to
get
fees.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
the
broad
discretion
of
administrative
agencies
to
determine
how
they
will
enforce
their
statutory
duties.
cases
such
as
florida
east
coast
railroad,
or
vermont
yankee
nuclear
power
plant.
the
agency
has
very
broad
discretion.
but
the
flip
side
of
that
is,
they
did
have
the
authority,
there
was
no
bar,
to
their
involving
us
in
this
case
as
parties.
and
they
did
so.
i
think
one
of
the
most
telling
weaknesses
of
the
defendant's
case
is
the
lack--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--that's
clear.
yes,
we
agree
with
that.
the
defendants
in
this
argument,
notably
absent
from
their
discussion,
is,
what
does
the
language
of
the
statute
say,
and
what
does
the
legislative
history
show.
here
the
language
used
is,
as
this
court
noted
in
carey,
the
broad
disjunctive:
"any
action
or
proceeding".
not
only
any
action,
not
any
mandatory
action
or
proceeding,
but
any
action
or
proceeding.
it's
noteworthy--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--i
think
the
same
situation
is
in
title
vii,
upon
which
section
1988
was
explicitly
modelled.
and
in
carey
this
court
found
that
you
were
entitled
to
an
independent
action
for
fees.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
and
the
court...
granted
it
was
dicta,
the
court
reaffirmed
that
dicta,
though,
in
white
v.
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
yes.
but
as
we
have
explained,
if
a
court
action
is
required,
it
was
present
here
in
the
ecos
action.
we
wanted
to
submit
the
fees
for
determination
in
the
ecos
action.
we
asked
the...
we
raised
that
with
the
defendants
at
that
time.
they
stated,
no,
let's
not
do
that
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
settlement
that
we
reached
was
contingent
upon
legislative
acts
by
the
city
of
durham.
they
had
to
promulgate
and
comply
with
statutory
requirements
to
implement
a
redevelopment
plan
for
this
entire
area.
they
could
not
commit
in
advance
to
that.
and
the
settlement
explicitly
provided,
if
they
didn't
do
this,
this
was
all
void.
second,
the
defendant
said,
we
are
a
state
agency,
and
it
would
be
a
lengthy
process
to
come
up
with
agreement
and
consent
on
the
fees.
let's
negotiate
further.
and
we
did
so.
and
then
after
we
could
not
reach
agreement,
we
brought
suit.
but
the
ecos
claim
included
a
claim
for
fees,
and
when
we
signed
that
consent
judgment,
the
judgment
specifically
reserved
our
right
to
bring
a
subsequent
claim
for
fees.
we
had
that
right
in
ecos.
in
the
ecos
case
it
was
dismissed
without
prejudice.
and
that's
explicit
in
the
consent
judgment
which
we
signed
in
ecos.
we
could
have
brought
it
in
ecos.
there
were
various
reasons
why
it
was
not
done
there.
but
neither
the
court
nor
the
defendant
objected
to
our
saving
it
for
a
later
date,
if
it
could
not
be
resolved.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
the
ecos
action
was
originally
an
environmental
suit.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
yes.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
no.
but
the--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--if
an
independent
court
action
is
required,
if
that
anomalous
result
or
practice
is
required,
we
did
go
to
federal
court
on
the
merits
here.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
and
this...
and
through
our
intervention
it
did
become
that.
because
it
dismissed
with
prejudice...
the
ecos
action
dismissed
with
prejudice
our
title
vi
rights.
if
those
rights
were
not
before
the
court
in
ecos,
how
could
those
rights
have
been
dismissed?
in
conclusion,
congress
in
the
legislative
history
rejected--
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
--we
don't
think
it's
essential
to
our
claim.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
but
we
think
it
certainly
bolsters
the
claim
that
this
was
no
friendly
get-together
we
had
here.
mr.
michael
david
calhoun
they
were
dragged
into
this
conciliation
agreement.
they
did
not
voluntarily
change
their
ways
after
we
raised
this
complaint.
