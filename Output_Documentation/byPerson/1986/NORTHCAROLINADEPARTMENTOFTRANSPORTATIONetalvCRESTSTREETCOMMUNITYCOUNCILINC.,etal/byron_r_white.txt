justice
white
so
it's
been
outstanding
for
ten
years.
justice
white
i
suppose...
did
they
want
to,
without
having
intervened?
or
did
you
want
them
to?
or
both?
justice
white
well,
could
i
just
ask
you--
justice
white
--do
the
regulations,
or
something,
anticipate
the
filing
of
complaints?
justice
white
administrative
complaints.
justice
white
the
filing
of
complaints
with
the
administration?
justice
white
so
they
were
following
the
administrative
procedure?
justice
white
and
you
think
this
was
a
proceeding?
justice
white
well,
it
isn't
required,
but
it's
permitted.
justice
white
do
you
think
this
is
a
proceeding?
it
isn't
a
proceeding
that's
required,
i
guess.
justice
white
but
it's
a
proceeding,
nevertheless,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
they
filed
a
complaint
and
participated.
justice
white
well,
they
told
the
department
what
they
objected
to.
justice
white
and
the
department
addressed
those
complaints.
justice
white
you're
not
suggesting
that
crest
street
and
the
state
highway
department
were
not
antagonists
in
these
discussions?
justice
white
right,
right.
justice
white
well,
i
know.
there
wouldn't
have
been
anything
to
resolve
if
there
hadn't
been
differences
of
opinion.
justice
white
voluntary
dispute.
so
there
was
a
dispute
between
crest
street
and
the
department?
justice
white
and
then...
but
the
suit
nevertheless
was
allowed
to
continue
for
the
purposes
of
attorney's
fees?
justice
white
were
you
entitled
to
do
that,
by
the
way?
justice
white
could
you
have
filed
a
title
vi
suit?
justice
white
under
title
vi
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
that
you
can
bring;
is
that
right?
justice
white
which
now
could
have
been
filed,
at
least
under
present
law,
you
think,
could
have
been
filed
immediately
without
filing
any
complaint
before
the
agency?
justice
white
and
i
suppose
if
you
filed
a
suit,
and
then
went
ahead
with
these
private
discussions,
you
could
get
attorney's
fees?
justice
white
in
another
dictum?
justice
white
what
was
the
ecos
action?
justice
white
it
was
not
a
title
vi?
justice
white
and
that's
what
the
injunction
was
entered
under?
justice
white
and
could
you
have
gotten...
you
couldn't
have
got
attorney's
fees
just
for
your
success
in
getting
in
the
injunction?
justice
white
so
how
could
the...
when
the
injunction
was
withdrawn,
you
thought...
you
think...
that
that
was
an
independent
ground
for
your
getting
attorney's
fees
for
administrative
services?
