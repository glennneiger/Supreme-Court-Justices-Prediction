chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
afternoon
in
no.
85-767,
north
carolina
department
of
transportation
versus
crest
street
community
council.
you
may
proceed,
general
thornburgh.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
was
the
united
states
department
of
transportation
you
referred
to,
general
thornburg?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thornburg.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lazarus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
can
go
until
the
red
light.
or
are
you
reserving?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thornburg.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
calhoun.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
there
a
final
settlement
document
before
the
dot...
which
was
approved
by
the
dot?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
settlement
agreement
was
not
approved
by
the
dot;
is
that
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
who
were
the
parties
to
the
settlement
agreement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
was
that
then
submitted
to
the
dot
for
its
approval?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
was
dot's
response?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there
was
no
approval
or
ratification
either?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
there
implicit
approval?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
this
something
that's
quite
difficult
to
get
the
dot
to
do,
to
allow
a
complaint
to
be
withdrawn.
chief
justice
rehnquist
except
under...
you
would
have
had
to
go
to
the
state
agency.
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
it
true,
mr.
calhoun,
under
title
vii,
whether
a
deferral
or
nondeferral
state,
you
must
go
to
the
agency
before
you
can
go
to
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
wasn't
that
part
of
the
reasoning
of
our
opinion
in
new
york
gaslight,
was
that
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
administrative
proceeding
is
a
prerequisite
to
court
action?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
your
view,
there's
no
question.
but
your
opponents
certainly
question
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
referred
to
you,
i
thought,
as
an
applicant
for
intervention?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
substance
of
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
don't
think
you're
helped
much
by
the
language
of
the
statute.
because
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
the
statute
says
that
the
court,
in
that
proceeding,
may
award.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
court
said
that.
it
was
dicta,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
calhoun.
general
thornburg,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
two
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
