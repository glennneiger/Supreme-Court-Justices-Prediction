mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
honorable
court:
this
is
a
case
arising
under
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
award
act
of
1976,
42
usc
1988.
it
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
attorneys'
fees
are
appropriate
in
federal
administrative
procedures
under
title
vi,
when
there's
no
connected
court
action
in
which
the
fees
are
recoverable.
and
more
narrowly
stated:
is
a
recipient
liable
for
fees
to
private
complainants
for
time
spent
in
resolving
their
complaint
by
the
voluntary
informal
means
that
are
provided
in
title
vi
and
implementing
regulations.
here
no
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
title
vi
was
ever
brought
in
court,
and
no
formal
administrative
hearings
or
actions
in
course
to
enforce
title
vi
were
instituted
by
the
united
states
department
of
transportion.
the
essential
facts
in
this
action
developed
as
follows.
from
the
early
1950s
the
state
and
municipal
and
federal
officials
had
been
engaged
in
planning
for
an
east-west
expressway
through
the
city
of
durham,
north
carolina,
in
compliance
with
federal
laws
and
procedures.
and
from
time
to
time
the
expressway
appeared
on
the
plan
and
was
shown
in
a
broad
ribbon
showing
to
pass
through
the
crest
street
community,
which
was
a
predominantly
black
community.
construction...
it
was
agreed
that
the
expressway
would
be
constructed
in
segments.
by
december,
1971,
three
segments
were
either
completed
or
were
under
construction.
and
at
that
time
an
incorporated
group
know
as
ecos,
incorporated,
and
duke
university
students,
and
some
others,
filed
an
action
in
the
middle
district
court
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
against
the
department
of
transportation,
the
commissioner
of...
north
carolina
highway
commissioners,
and
others,
seeking
injunctive
relief
in
that
they
asked
that
the
construction
of
the
entire
expressway
be
enjoined.
the
present
respondents
were
not
party
to
that
action.
the
grounds
for
relief
alleged
in
that
action
were:
failure
to
hold
public
hearings;
failure
to
comply
with
protection
for
park
lands;
failure
to
prepare
an
appropriate
environment
impact
statement.
on
february
20th
of
1973,
the
court
enjoined
construction
on
the
expressway
past
those
three
segments
that
were
then
in
progress,
in
construction,
until
the
compliance
was
had
in
full
with
the
statutes
that
were
alleged
to
have
been
violated.
no
title
vi
issues
were
raised
in
the
ecos
action,
or
contended
at
that
time.
then
for
approximately
three
years,
nothing
further
was
done
toward
additional
construction.
but
in
late
'77,
the
highway
authorities
began
public
meetings,
and
interest
was
renewed.
and
at
that
time
they
began
receiving
information
to
prepare
a
draft
environmental
impact
statement
and
holding
public
meetings.
and
one
of
these
meetings
was
held
in
the
crest
street
community
which
was
attended
by
various
parties
that
were
interested
in
the
construction.
now,
these
meetings
continued
through
'77
and
'78,
and
in
'77
counsel
were
sought
by
the
crest
street
group,
and
began
their
representation
in
these
informal
proceedings.
of
course,
other
groups
were
attending
these
meetings
at
the
same
time.
and
then
in
september
of
'78,
the
attorneys
for
the
respondents
filed
an
administratif
complaint
with
the
u.s.
department
of
transportation
alleging
that
this...
if
construction
were
completed
in
accordance
with
the
plans
that
were
being
proposed,
that
this
would
constitute
a
violation
of
their
title
vi
rights.
the
highway
project
then
continued
in
the
planning
stage.
and
in
october
of
that
same
year,
october
of
'78,
a
draft
environmental
impact
statement
was
filed
by
the
transportation
authorities.
and
at
that
time,
after
the
filing
of
the
administrative
complaint,
the
department
of
transportation
said
to
the
parties:
see
if
you
can't
settle
your
differences
by
voluntary
dispute
resolution.
and
the
parties
did
continue
at
that
time
with
their
informal
meetings.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
was
the
civil
rights
office
of
the
u.s.
department
of
transportation.
these
informal
meetings
continued
as
they
had
before
the
complaint
was
filed.
and
in
february
of
'80,
the...
after
an
investigation,
the
u.s.
department
of
transportation
did
send
the
department
of
transportation
of
north
carolina
a
letter
saying:
if
you
complete
this
construction
in
accordance
with
your
proposed
plans,
we
think
it
would
constitute
a
violation
of
title
vi.
so
in
june
of
'80,
pursuant
to
this,
and
pursuant
to
the
request
from
the
u.s.
department
of
transportation,
the
parties,
various
parties
including
duke
university,
va
hospital,
and
all
the
others
there,
formed
a
steering
committed.
and
they
began
to
address,
in
earnest,
the
differences
between
the
crest
street
community
and
the
other
parties
as
to
where
this
expressway
was
to
be
located.
and
by
september
of
1981,
tentative
agreement
was
reached
as
to
what
would
be
done.
and
by
march,
1982,
a
preliminary
agreement,
final
environmental
impact
statement
incorporating
the
agreement,
had
been
reached.
and
the
details
were
finalized.
and
by
april
of
1982,
everyone
agreed
that
for
all
practical
purposes
the
dispute
had
been
resolved.
now
during
this
entire
period,
the
respondents
had
filed
no
court
action--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--i
would
say
that
the
bulk
of
the
relief
requested
was
obtained
in
the
sense
that
what
they
sought,
if
your
honor
please,
it
dealt
with
primarily...
their
complaint
dealt
with
the
relocation
of
parties
that
lived
in
the
crest
street
community
that
were
being
moved
as
a
result
of
the
building
of
the
road.
and
we
certainly
concede
that,
for
all
practical
purposes,
it
was
obtained.
and
everybody
was
in
agreement.
and
they
had
decided
what
would
be
done,
how
it
would
be
done,
the
plan
that
would
be
implemented.
and
this
was
in
april
of
1982.
now
all
the
participants,
at
this
time,
from
the
beginning,
had
known
and
continued
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
injunction
outstanding
in
ecos
that
dealt
with
the
construction
of
this
expressway,
and
proscribed
it,
absent
its
dissolution.
so
it
august
of
1982,
the
state
highway
authorities--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--that
was
the
middle
district
court,
federal
middle
district
court
for
north
carolina,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
'73.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
exactly.
roughly
ten
years.
and
then
the
petitioners,
we,
went
into
court
and
asked
that
it
be
dissolved.
now,
the
reason
for
that
was
so
that
we
could
implement
this
plan.
and
everybody
knew
that
that
had
to
be
resolved
before
the
plan
could
be
implemented.
and
then
in
october,
after
our
filing
to
dissolve
the
injunction,
the
respondents,
for
the
first
time
then,
filed
a
motion
with
the
middle
district
court
asking
to
be
permitted
to
intervene.
and
in
their
proposed
complaint,
they
asked
for
the
same
relief
essentially
that
had
been
filed
in
the
administrative
complaint
filed
with
the
federal...
with
the
united
states
department
of
transportation;
that
being
that
no
further
construction
be
permitted,
and
that...
or
that
the
construction
be
completely
removed
from
the
area.
this
was
after
the
agreement
had
been
reached
by
the
parties.
and
everybody
in
april
had
said
that
the
dispute
was
resolved.
now,
the
respondents
were
never
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
ecos
action.
but
they
did
sign
a
consent
judgment
in
the
case
when
the...
when
the
injunction
was
dissolved
and
the
action--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--we
really
had
no
serious
objection.
because
the
judgment
referred
to
them
as
applicants
for
intervention,
your
honor.
and
their
purpose,
primarily,
we
felt,
was
to
see
that
the...
be
there
in
case
the
plan...
we
failed
to
implement
the
plan.
and
so
they
were
referred
to
as
applicants
to
intervene.
and
they
reserved
in
this
judgment
the
right
to
seek
their
attorneys'
fees.
one
of
the
things
that
happened
during
the
course
of
this
series
of
meetings
was,
that
we
were
getting
nowhere
on
the
attorneys'
fees
matter,
but
were
able
to
get
down
to
the
crux
of
the
issues,
and
that
was,
what
was
best
for
the
crest
street
community.
so
all
the
parties
agreed
that
they
would
just
set
aside
the
attorneys'
fee
issue.
so
when
this
judgment
was
entered,
it
reserved
the
right
to
proceed
in
case
the
plan
was
not
implemented;
and
secondly,
reserved
to
them
the
right
to
seek
attorneys'
fees.
on
december
15th,
the
day
after
the
consent
judgment
was
filed...
that
was
in
1982...
then
the
parties
formally
executed
the
mitigation
plan.
and
the
implementation
program
is
on
schedule
as
of
this
date.
now
this
fairly
lengthy
recitation
of
the
facts
points
up
the
accuracy
of
the
district
court's
crucial
findings
of
fact.
and
i
would
like
to
review
those
briefly
for
the
court,
by
reason
of
this
court's
deference
to
what
the
district
court
does.
and
in
this
case,
the
district
court
held,
in
its
findings
of
fact,
that
the
respondents
never
intervened
in
ecos;
that
only
37
of
the
1,261
hours
that
were
spent
in
dispute
resolution
process
involved
preparation
of
pleadings
concerning
ecos,
or
negotiations
toward
and
review
of
the
final
mitigation
plan;
and
included
in
the
consent
judgment
that
the
ecos
injunction
prohibited
construction
pending
compliance
with
laws
other
than
title
vi;
that
by
motion
to
intervene
the
respondents
sought
to
enjoin
extension
of
the
highway;
and
a
declaration
that
the
petitioners'
practices
violated
title
vi;
that
they
obtained
neither;
that
the
ecos
injunction
only
prohibited
construction
pending
compliance
with
laws
other
than
title
vi;
went
on
to
hold
that
there
was
no
showing
that
their
ecos
fee
efforts
contributed
to
the
execution
of
the
final
mitigation
plan;
that
final
settlement
seemed
imminent
when
the
motion
to
intervene
was
filed;
and
that
respondents
did
not
show
that
their
efforts
in
ecos,
in
an
action
where
they
never
parties,
was
a
catalyst
to
the
plan.
now
those
are
the
things
that
the
district
court
found
in
its
crucial
findings
of
fact.
most
of
those
start
on
page
28
of
the
joint
appendix.
1988
provides
that
in
any
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
the
provision
of
title
vi,
the
court,
in
its
discretion,
may
allow
the
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
a
part
of
the
cost.
2000s-1
directs
promulgation
of
rules.
49
cfr
21.1
is
a
set
of
rules
that
the
u.s.
department
of
transportation
promulgated
pursuant
to
that
statutory
mandate.
the
complainants,
or
the
respondents
in
this
action,
filed
their
administrative
complaint
under
section
21.1
et
seq.
and
under
that
section,
they
are
required...
or
the
u.s.
department
of
transportation
is
required
to
seek
resolution
of
disputes
by
informal
means,
if
possible.
that
was
as
far
as
the
parties
ever
got
in
this
action,
was
the
resolution
of
the
dispute
by
these
informal
means
that
the
act
refers
to.
now
2113
provides
that
if
the
informal
means
don't
work,
then
what
can
be
done
after
that.
but--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--informal
dispute
resolution?
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
that's
in
2149c.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
21...
it's
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
49
cfr
21.1
et
seq.
,
a
series
of
provisions
there.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
it
was--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--yes,
sir.
this
specifically...
these
are
rules
that
they
adopted
pursuant
to
the
congressional
direction.
as
emphasized
in...
by
congress
in
its
enactment
of
2000d-1,
and
the
u.s.
department
of
transportation
in
its
adopted
rules,
informal
dispute
resolution
and
voluntary
compliance
was
hopefully
to
be
realized
without
the
necessity
of
court
actions.
the
parties...
the
respondents
never
became
parties
to
any
proceeding
to
enforce
title
vi.
they
did,
in
fact,
become
involved
in
the
administrative
enforcement
process
by
calling
to
the
attention
of
the
u.s.
department
of
transportaton
a
potential
violation.
and
thereafter,
they,
along
with
various
others,
participated
in
this
dispute
resolution
process.
and
they
participated
in
the
informal
discussions
that
were
initiated
by
the
agency.
and
the
negotiations,
we
contend,
did
not
amount
to
private
enforcement
proceedings
under
the
act;
and
that
their
role
was
participants,
simply
in
this
voluntary
dispute
resolution
process;
and
that
from
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
their
participation
was
permissive.
now,
this
court,
in
cannon,
recognized
the
limited
and
permissive
nature
of
a
complainant's
role
in
its
holding
concerning
title
ix,
and
therefore
title
vi,
where
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
is
not
required
before
the
filing
of
a
private
right
of
action.
now
in
the
context
of
this
case,
the
congressional
design
for
administrative
enforcement
relies
on
the
federal
agency
as
the
enforcer.
and
the
main
thrust
is
to
obtain
recipient
compliance
by
voluntary
means.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
i'm
sorry?
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
the
respondents
did
in
this
case.
pursuant
to
these
rules,
they
did
file
their
administrative
complaint.
and
then
the--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--oh,
yes.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
i
think
it
was
a
process,
a
voluntary
dispute
process,
that
does
not
raise
to
the
level
of
a
proceeding
that's
required
by
1988,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
this
form--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--oh,
no.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
it
is
a
procedure,
or
proceeding.
but
what
we're
saying
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is,
that
this
is
something
that
is
informal
in
which
these
folks
are
not
really
parties,
as
such.
they're
participants.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
they
filed
a
complaint
simply
calling
to
the
attention
of
the
u.s.
department
of
transportation
the
fact
that
this
potential
violation--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
the
department,
as
required
by
these
same
regulations,
then
said:
we'll
have
an
investigation.
and
they
did
have
an
investigation.
and
that
was
what
precipitated
their
letter
in
1980,
february
of
'80,
saying:
if
you
go
the
way
you're
going
right
now,
then
you
are
going
to
have
a...
probably
have
a
violation.
you
see,
this
whole
process,
nothing
was
finalized
at
this
point.
the
subject
was
still
open
to
debate
as
to
where
this
road
was
going
to
be
located.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
you
know,
i
don't
think
that
you
would
say
that
any
of
these
folks
were
antagonists.
they
were...
they
had
different
ideas
as
to
how
to
work
this
out,
your
honor.
but
they
came...
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
voluntary
dispute
resolution
with
the
involvement
of
a
court.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
because
they
couldn't
have
done
it
in
a
court
proceeding.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
oh,
difference
of
opinion,
sure.
but
not--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--yes,
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
if
your
honor
please,
unless
the
court
has
additional
questions,
we
have
nothing
further.
