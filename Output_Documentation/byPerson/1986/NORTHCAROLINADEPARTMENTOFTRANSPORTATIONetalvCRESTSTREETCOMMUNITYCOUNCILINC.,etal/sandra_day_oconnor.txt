justice
o'connor
mr.
lazarus,
if
the
parties
had
not
reached
total
agreement,
and
litigation
had
been
proceeded
with
the
counsel,
would
attorneys'
fees
be
available
for
any
portion
of
the
work
done
in
the
administrative
proceeding
under
webb?
justice
o'connor
under
the
holding
in
webb;
that
kind
of
approach?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
your
approach
is
likely
to
cause
people
to
file
more
lawsuits,
then,
to
make
sure
that
they
have
that
as
a
means
of
getting
attorneys'
fees,
rather
than
settling
these
things
informally?
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
the
motion
to
intervene
was
denied,
though,
wasn't
it?
