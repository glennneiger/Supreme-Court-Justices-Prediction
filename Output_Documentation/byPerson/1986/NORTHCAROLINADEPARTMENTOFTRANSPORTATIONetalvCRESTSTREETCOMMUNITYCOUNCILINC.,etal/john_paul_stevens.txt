justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
calhoun:
the
complain
you
refer
to
was
filed
before
the
federal
department
of
transportation;
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
did
the
federal
department
of
transportation
ever
enter
any
formal
orders
in
that
proceeding?
justice
stevens
and
asked
the
parties
to
talk
to
one
another
about
a
settlement.
after
that,
did
they
enter
any
formal
order?
justice
stevens
i
know
they
urged
them.
but
my
question
is,
did
the
department
of...
federal
department
of
transportation
enter
any
final
order
in
what
you
describe
as
a
proceeding?
justice
stevens
mr.
calhoun,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
a
great
deal
of
importance,
as
i
understand
it,
attaches
to
the
fact
that
you
actually
did
file
a
complaint
with
the
federal
department
of
transportation
which
precipitated
all
of
this.
supposing
instead
of
filing
a
formal
complaint,
you
had
made
known
more
informally...
written
them
a
letter,
and
said,
we
think
a
violation
is
occurring
here.
and
they
said,
okay,
we'll
take
a
look
at
it.
but
you
hadn't
complied
with
any
formal
regulations.
they
looked
at
it
and
asked
you
to
do
just
exactly
what
you
did.
and
everything
else
followed
the
same.
would
you
be
entitled
to
fees?
justice
stevens
and
it's
the
filing
of
the
complaint?
justice
stevens
but
did
it
trigger
proceedings
before
the
department
of
transportation?
justice
stevens
finding
of
a
title
vi
violation?
justice
stevens
a
probable
cause
finding,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
would
it
make
some
sense
to
say
that
if
the
agency
gives
you
the
relief
that
you
want,
you
don't
get
fees;
if
they
deny
it,
and
you
later
get
it
in
court,
in
addition
to
paying
court
costs,
as
part
of
the
costs,
which
is
the
way
the
statute
reads,
as
part
of
the
costs
in
that
proceeding,
you
will
also
get
your
administrative
costs?
isn't
that
a
thoroughly
rational
scheme?
it
encourages
the
agency
to
give
you
what
you're
entitled
to
at
the
administrative
stage,
because
if
it
doesn't
do
so
and
is
forced
to
do
so
by
a
court,
you're
going
to
pick
up
your
fees.
otherwise,
you
don't
get
your
fees.
justice
stevens
no,
carey
involved
the
same
proceeding.
it
was
not
a
simple
proceeding
for
attorney's
fees.
in
carey,
this
court
was
reversing
the
agency's
denial...
or
the
lower
courts
were...
reversing
the
agency's
denial
of
the
relief,
weren't
they?
in
a
free-standing
action
for
attorney's
fees.
justice
stevens
the
federal
court
action
was
dismissed,
because
the
defendant
had
agreed
to
abide
by
the
state
ruling;
isn't
that
true?
in
gaslight?
justice
stevens
you
would
have
the
same
claim
if
they
had
responded
to
your
complaint
by
just
saying,
well,
we're
not
sure
whether
there's
a
violation,
but
we'd
like
you
parties
to
try
and
negotiate
a
settlement
anyway?
