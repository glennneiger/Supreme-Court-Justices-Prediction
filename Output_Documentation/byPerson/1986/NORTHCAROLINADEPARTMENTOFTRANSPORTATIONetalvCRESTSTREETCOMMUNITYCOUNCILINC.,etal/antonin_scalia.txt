justice
scalia
mr.
calhoun,
while
we're
on
the
text
of
the
act,
it
doesn't
say
that
you're
entitled
to
fees
with
respect
to
any
action
or
proceeding.
it
says,
in
any
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
a
certain
number
of
provisions,
among
which
is
not
1988.
in
such
an
action
or
proceeding,
the
court,
in
that
proceeding,
may
award
reasonable
attorneys
fees.
now,
it
is
possible,
when
there
is
an
appeal
from
a
title
vii
denial,
or
even
from
denial
of
some
action
under
title
vi,
perhaps
even
the
very
action
at
issue
here,
where
there
is
an
appeal
to
the
court
from
that,
one
could
regard
that
as
being
one
entire
proceeding.
so
that
the
court,
in
that
proceeding,
could
award
attorneys'
fees
not
just
for
the
participation
in
court
but
even
for
the
participation
at
the
administrative
stage.
but
this
suit
before
us
here
is
not
an
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
a
provision
of
sections
1981,
1982,
1983,
1985
and
1986.
it
just
isn't.
it's
a
totally
separate
proceeding
to
get
attorney's
fees
under
1988.
justice
scalia
no,
that's
not
the
argument
i'm
suggesting.
what
troubles
me
is
that
the
statutory
language
clearly
envisions
that
it
is
the
court
in
the
action
or
proceeding
that
can
award
the
fees.
and
we
are
not...
or
the
courts
below
were
not...
the
court
in
an
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
1981,
82,
83,
85
or
86.
they
were
a
court
in
a
proceeding
to
get
attorney's
fees.
justice
scalia
why
is
that
so
anamolous?
doesn't
it
happen
all
the
time
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act?
if
you
hire
an
attorney,
got
to
the
agency,
negotiate
very
actively
with
the
agency
to
get
what
you
want;
the
agency
finally
says,
okay,
you
have
it,
you're
not
entitled
to
your
attorney's
fees.
but
if
the
agency
says
no,
and
then
you
have
to
sue
the
agency,
you
are
entitled
to
attorney's
fees.
doesn't
it
happen
all
the
time
whenever...
you
can't
avoid
that
problem
under
any
system
of
attorney's
fees?
justice
scalia
do
i
interpret
that
last
remark
to
mean
that
if
these
regulations
were
eliminated,
that
if
there
were...
if
the
agency
were
not
obliged
to
and
chose
not
to
have
such
complaint
procedures,
your
mere
application
to
the
agency
would
not
suffice?
justice
scalia
well,
it's
not
just
a
court
action.
it's
a
court
action
to
enforce
those
particular
provisions
of
the
united
states
code
set
forth
in
section
1988.
justice
scalia
mr.
calhoun,
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
i
think
in
answer
to
a
question
by
justice
scalia
you
indicated
that
your
complaint
was
critical
to
your
claim.
is
the
letter
of
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
transportation
of
february
20,
1980,
also
critical
to
your
claim,
in
which
they
conclude
that
there
might
be
a
prima
facie
violation
of
title
vi?
justice
scalia
you
don't.
