mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
right
up
front
here
some
of
the
questions
you've
been
asking,
and
there's
been
a
number
of
them.
but
to
come
back
to
justice
stevens'
question
concerning
the
probable
cause
requirement
at
common
law,
i
think
it
is
an
interesting
point
to
note
that
the
malley
decision
was
based
on
a
standard
that
was
appropriate
in
malicious
prosecution,
where
there
would
be
an
immunity
without
probable
cause.
but
in
a
trespass
case,
or
false
arrest
case,
you
could
never
have
an
immunity
without
probable
cause.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
common
law,
and
it's
derived
mainly
from
the
pierson
case,
where
they
said
you
needed
probable
cause
and
good
faith.
that
leads
me
to
a
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
about
the
government's
claim
that
our
standard
of
immunity
is
somehow
a
breathtaking
reduction
in
the
immunity
from
what
harlow
established.
i
don't
think
it
is
at
all.
because
harlow
did
two
things.
harlow
eliminated
a
lawsuit
in
a
case
where
there
was
a
novel
constitutional
right
being
asserted,
or
a
new
development.
and
it
established
an
immunity
right
up
front
in
the
case,
where
you
could
get
summary
judgment
just
based
on
the
state
of
law,
a
purely
legal
question.
and
i
think
that's
clearly
what
the
court
held
in
that
case.
and
it
also
did
one
other
thing;
it
eliminated
the
malice
prong
of
the
standard,
which
allowed
a
defendant
to
get
summary
judgment
more
easily
right
on
the
merits,
because
there
wouldn't
be
that
factual
question
still
existing
that
was
always
a
fact-based
question
that
precluded
summary
judgment
when
it
came
to
malice.
so
even
accepting
our
standard,
as
we
formulate
it
under
harlow,
the
government
has
still
a
broader
defense
because
that
malice
has
been
eliminated.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
way
we
formulate
the
standard
leads
to
such
a
drastic
reduction
as
what--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--the...
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
our
position,
that
it
would
be
a
new
development
or
a
novel
application
in
the
qualified
immunity
area
dealing
with
the
area
outside
the
warrants.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and
this
is
how
it
is
reconcilable
with
malley.
malley,
i
believe,
is
a
progeny
as
much
of
leon
as
it
is
of
harlow.
and
in
the
malley
case,
the
officer
got
the
warrant.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
the
distinction
between
the
malley
case
and
this
case
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
principles
that
apply,
make
it
appropriate,
that
the
officer
should
get
immunity
in
a
situation
where
he
gets
the
warrant.
because
in
doubtful
cases,
where
the
officer
goes
to
get
the
warrant,
the
search
should
be
upheld.
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
apply
the
second
part
of
that
standard,
and
that
is
in
doubtful
cases
where
there
is
not
a
warrant,
the
search
should
fail.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
yes,
you
did,
your
honor.
and
i
would...
in
my
view
of
the
immunity
standard,
malley
is
consistent
with
it
because
he
got
the
warrant.
and
we
believe
that
that
represents
a
special
circumstance
in
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
much
more
unique
area
of
the
law.
the
court
has
attempted
to
develop
a
standard
that
is
a
broad
doctrine
that
cuts
across
every
constitutional
area.
and
the
fourth
amendment
presents
unique
concerns
because
it
has
unique
rules.
ane
one
of
the
most
unique
rules
here
is
that
the
search
was
presumptively
illegal
when
anderson
conducted
it--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--in
the
fourth
amendment
context,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
but
i
would
like
you
to
keep
distinct
in
your
mind
the
warrant
context,
especially.
because
there,
the
officer,
if
he
has
any
doubt,
or
if
there
could
be
any
doubt,
the
situation
is
supposed
to
be
resolved
against
the
officer
and
in
favor
of
the
constitutional
right.
certainly
when
a
search
is
being
conducted
of
a
person's
home,
which
is
really
the
issue
in
this
case,
this
case
does
not
really
address
an
arrest
case
or
a
stop
case.
but
i
think
that
that's
the
appropriate
result
to
come
to.
i
can't
really
fathom
what
you
have
when
you...
let's
take
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard...
when
you
get
below
reasonable
suspicion,
all
you
have
is
suspicion.
and
the
court
has
always
said
that
that
isn't
enough
to
ever
stop
anybody.
and
i
think
that
justice,
or
chief
justice--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
the
case
should
be
limited
to
the
warrant
context.
because
what
you
have
in
this
situation,
and
i
think
it's
a
very
telling
point,
is,
is
that
if
you
scour
the
government's
brief,
and
you
scour
its
cert
petition,
you
don't
find
any
discussion
of
what
the
application
of
this
standard,
what
impact
it
will
have
on
constitutional
rights.
and
after
all,
our
constitution
was
enacted
to
protect
rights
much...
at
least
the
bill
of
rights
was...
much
more
than
it
was
to
empower
the
government
to
search.
and
by--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe,
though,
that
when
you
look
at
the
fourth
amendment,
that
you
should
resolve
it
in
favor
of
the
right,
that
that
has
been
traditionally
what--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--well,
i
would
have
to
be
presented
with
a
particular
argument.
clearly
in
a
case
like
mitchell
or
davis,
those
cases,
they
were
given
immunity,
and
they
were
not
resolved
in
favor
of
the
right.
so
in
those
cases,
no,
we're
not
asking
that
there
be
damages
in
a
case
like
that.
but
we
believe
that
the
standards
themselves
allow
for
a
lot
of
error
on
the
part
of
an
officer.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
yes.
and
especially
since...
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
this
court
has
done
a
lot
to
make
that
standard
easy
to
apply.
they've
eliminated
the
old
two
prong
test
in
the
informant
context.
they've
made
that
a
much
more
flexible
standard.
and
that
has
gone
a
long
way
to
establish
more
immunity
on
the
government,
in
effect,
because
it's
lowered
the
standard...
not
lowered
the
standard,
but--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
is
a
valid
concern.
and
i
have
two
responses
for
that.
first
of
all,
that
simply
because
an
officer
violate
a
right
does
not
mean
that
somebody
is
going
to
receive
a
huge
damage
award,
and
that
there
are
ways
to
deal
with
that
in
the
damages
area,
or
in
just
settling
the
suit
up
front
if
they
think
there
was
a
violation,
or
if
there's
a
holding
there
was
a
violation.
you
don't
have
to
go
through
the
rigors
of
litigation
necessarily
in
all
these
suits.
now
the
justice
department,
under
the
regulation
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
takes
the
position
that
we'll
never
settle
a
lawsuit
unless
there's
a
judgment,
and
that
we'll
defend
to
the
last
ditch
attempt
in
all
these
cases.
now,
i
think
that
dealing
with
it
at
the
damage
end
is
one
way
to
deal
with
your
concern,
and
the
other
one
is
to
reimburse
the
person.
if
the
executive
thinks
that
one
of
their
people
made
a
good
faith
mistake
in
applying
the
standard,
you
can
still
preserve
the
right
by
being
able
to
sue,
like
in
trespass,
for
a
nominal
damage,
or
establish
that
you
had
the
right,
and
they
could
reimburse
the
official.
they
certainly
provide
them
with
good
legal
counsel.
i
learned
that.
but
in
any
event,
we
believe
that
by
adopting
the
petitioner's
proposed
standard,
this
court
would
inevitably
do
away
with
the
rule
that
searches
of
doubtful
legality
conducted
without
a
warrant
should
fail.
i
can't
see
any
way
that
that
rule
could
survive
this.
it
certainly
would
be
the
case
that
innocent
people
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
that
rule.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
that's
a
good
question,
justice
scalia.
and
i
have
a
response
for
that
right
in
the
context
of
this
case.
here,
there
was
absolutely
no
deterrent
from
russell
anderson
proceeding
against
that
rule
when
he
was
searching
for
a
fugitive.
because
the
fugitive
would
have
no
standing
to
suppress
any
evidence
if
he
was
in
the
home
of
a
third
party,
and
he
couldn't
suppress
his
body.
so
in
the
context
of
the
steagald
case,
the
only
way
you
can
give
effect
to
the
steagald
case
is
to
make
sure
that
innocent
people
have
an
adequate
remedy.
and
if
you're
going
to
say
that
the
officer
has
a
heavy
burden
in
that
circumstance,
and
if
you're
going
to
say
that
it's
presumptively
illegal,
and
if
you're
going
to
continue
to
say
that
a
warrantless
search
will
fail
where...
if
doubtful,
where
a
warranted
one
wouldn't,
you
have
to
give
them
an
effective
remedy
in
there.
and
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
what
i
call
the
collapsing
of
the
immunity
standard
in
the
defense
on
the
merits.
the
government--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
well,
there's
a
map
attached
to
russell
anderson's
affidavit
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
but
they
were--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--they
were
in
the
selby
dale
area
and
north
of
94
there
in
st.
paul.
there
were
within,
i
believe,
a
three
to
four
mile
radius
of
the
bank.
turning
to
what
i
call
the
collapsing
of
the
immunity
standard,
is,
is
that
the
government
makes
the
argument
that
russell
anderson's
position
was,
is
that
either
he'd
be
charged
with
dereliction
of
duty
if
he
didn't
act,
or
he'd
be
mulcted
in
damages
if
he
did.
that
isn't
the
case,
really.
because
i
think
that
over
the
years,
as
the
court
has
been
applying
these
immunity
standards,
the
defense
on
the
liability
and
the
immunity
itself
has
kind
of
become
confused
in
some
sense.
because
if
you
take
pierson
v.
ray,
which
is
a
case
that
would
be,
i
think,
one
of
the
cases
most
directly
applicable
in
this
context,
the
court
there
didn't
really
hold
that
he
had
immunity;
they
just
said
that
in
a
1983
action
a
police
officer
would
have
a
defense
based
on
probable
cause
and
good
faith.
well,
as
that
became
kind
of
intertwined
in
the
stream
of
immunity
law
with
the
defamation
cases
and
the
absolute
immunity
cases
and
then
the
due
process
cases,
the
court
started
to
use
the
term,
qualified
immunity.
and
i
think
the
first
case
they
used
that
in
was
scheuer
v.
rhodes,
the
kent
state
killing
case.
and
what
they...
what
they
started
to
say
was,
they'd
be
entitled
to
immunity.
well,
there
was
never
any,
really,
immunity
for
a
officer
searching
at
common
law,
as
justice
stevens
was
pointing
out.
he
just
had
the
defense
based
on
probable
cause.
and
so
as
that
has
been
picked
up,
it's
kind
of
been
wrapped
in
with
the
due
process
standards--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--right.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
right,
but
on
a
defense
on
the
merits.
and
russell
anderson
is
in
no
worse
of
a
position
here,
because
under
the
eighth
circuit's
position,
he
has
the
right
to
go
back
to
trial
and
prove
his
justification.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
that's
right.
that's
how
i
read
it.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
well,
that...
your
honor,
maybe
i
should
be
a
bit
more
specific
in
response
to
your
question.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
statute
that
was
held
unconstitutional.
and
so,
very
similar
to
the
mitchell
context,
where
there
was
a
constitutional
violation,
the
officer
did
have
a
defense
if
he
had
probable
cause
to
believe
the
statute,
which
later
was
declared
to
be
unconstitutional,
was
violated,
and
he
acted
in
good
faith.
that
is
what
the
case
held,
so...
but
in
the
context
of
my
case,
i
believe
the
pierson
v.
ray
rule
would
require
probable
cause.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
in
a
false
arrest
case,
yes,
that
they
would
need
probable
cause
for
a
defense.
and
it
wouldn't--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--is
that
the
state
law?
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
the
common
law,
your
honor,
i
believe,
is
that
you
had
to
prove
your
legal
privilege.
no
throughout
the
development
of--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--well,
if
you
had
a
privilege
to
arrest
somebody,
meaning
that
if
you
met
the
legal
standard,
then
the
arrest--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--yes,
i
do,
if
probable
cause
was
the
standard
being
applied
at
the
time.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
okay.
i
don't...
i
have
done
some
research
on
that,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
there...
under
the
old
formulation
they
used
to
use
the
reasonable
standard
and
the
probable
cause
has
been
engrafted
on
that.
but
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
this:
that
in
butz
v.
economou,
there's
a
foot
note
in
the
case
that
says,
the
government
was
opposing
the
bivens
act,
the
bivens
case,
because
they
were
saying,
well,
the
state
law
tort
action
gives
you
a
good
enough
remedy,
and
that
all
the
probable
cause
standard
would
do
there
is
provide
a
defense
to
that
action,
so
there
should
be
a
federal
cause
of
action
like
we
have
here
today.
and
that
was
right
in
the
butts
decision.
i
took
a
look
at
the
briefs,
and
the
government
argued
it
there;
they
thought
it
was
sufficient
back
then.
but
now
they
don't
think
it's
sufficient
to
protect
them,
even
when
the
standard
is
more
flexible
now
under
the
gates
case.
in
any
case,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
reaffirmed,
time
and
time
again,
its
preference
for
warrants
in
these
search
cases.
the
leon
decision
gave
real
meaning
to
that
preference,
because
when
you
turn
to
use
a
warrant,
you
are
able
to
use
the
evidence.
and
as
i
said,
we
only
asked
the
court
to
give
meaning
to
the
second
part
of
that
standard,
that
when
there's
a
search
of
doubtful
legality,
without
a
warrant,
it
should
fail.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
no,
the
court
has
not.
but
i
believe
this
case
is
probably
the
closest
to
it
that
has
reached
the
court
at
this
time,
even
though
it
is
in
the
civil
context,
given
what
has
been
said
in
the
malley
case,
that
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
would
be
coextensive
with
the
good
faith
exception
and
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
well,
if
they
followed...
if
the
court
were
to
follow
what
was
said
in
malley,
that
would
be
my
conclusion.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
necessary
conclusion.
but
the
court
has
indicated
in
malley--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--that
if
the
court
were
to
apply
the
good
faith
exception
in
a
warrantless
context,
it
isn't
a
necessary
conclusion
that
the
officer
would
have
to
have
qualified
immunity.
it
was
not
the
holding
of
the
malley
case,
but
it
indicated
that
the
court
was
going
to
proceed
in
that
fashion.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
yes,
i
believe
that's
incorporated
right
into
the
probable
cause
standard
itself.
in
any
case,
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
unique
area
that
has
different
rules
than
other
areas;
different
rules
that
due
process
areas.
and
it
has
a
different
history
than
the
due
process
area
that
has
developed
much
of
the
qualified
immunity
law.
the
government
simply
has
not
addressed
what
impact
it
will
have
on
these
constitutional
rights
in
its
briefs
anywhere.
it
does
not
even
cite
in
its
case...
in
its
briefs,
the
steagald
decision.
and
i
can't
see
how
in
this
case,
where
it
is
based
entirely
on
the
fourth
amendment,
and
our
claim
is
that
the
standard
will
change
the
long
established
rules
in
the
fourth
amendment,
that
there's
no
discussion
of
it
there.
they
simply
are
not
concerned
with
the
constitutional
rights.
and
their
indifference,
i
think,
to
those
rights
is
highlighted
by
a
statement
made
in
their
cert
petition,
where
they
say
that
under
the
court
of
appeals
standard,
the
petitioner's
immunity
will
be
defeated
on
nothing
more
than
a
showing
he
trespassed
on
a
general
principle
of
law.
well,
what
really
happened
in
this
case
is
that
he
trespassed
on
more
than
an
abstract
principle
of
law;
he
trespassed
on
the
creighton's
home.
and--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--well,
your
honor,
i
call
to
mind
your
opinion
in
halperin
v.
kissinger.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
did
not
seem
to
be
concerned
with
applying
the
reasonableness
doctrine
of
the
fourth
amendment.
there
was
no
discussion
about
that
even
being
too
general
of
a
standard
to
apply.
it
was
a
question
in
that
case
whether
it
could
be
applied.
and
i
think
that
they
came
at
immunity
from
just
about
every
area,
and
that
was
one
of
them
that
was
not
attacked.
i
think
that
these
standards,
probable
cause
and
reasonable
circumstances,
are
much
easier
to
apply
than
what
the
government
is
making
them
out
to
be.
i
think
those
standards
are
fairly
low
standards.
and
it
isn't
like
they're
exceedingly
difficult
to
apply.
and
furthermore,
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
exigent
circumstances
case,
russell
anderson
was
not
faced
with
being
charged
with
dereliction
of
his
duties
or
being
mulcted
with
damages;
he
could
have
gone
and
got
a
warrant.
and
he
never
even
attempted
to
get
a
warrant.
and
that's
one
of
the
really
ironic
things
in
this
case,
is
that
he
told
cerise
creighton,
i
don't
need
a
damn
warrant
when
i'm
searching
for
a
fugitive.
and
under
the
objective
facts
of
the
case,
and
under
the
government's
own
standard,
he
was
violating
clearly
established
law
that
a
reasonable
police
officer
would
have
known
of.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
if
he
had
gotten
a
warrant,
then
we'd
be
in
the
malley
v.
briggs
situation
where--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--no,
i
believe
that
our
argument
is
consistent
with
fourth
amendment
principles,
which
malley
is
too.
so
we
would
also
encompass
the
situation
in
malley.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
yes.
under
the
principle
that
a
doubtful
search,
conducted
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant,
will
be--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--if
it
was
a
reasonable--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--if
it
was
a
reasonable
error,
if--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--well,
right
under
the
standard
in
malley
v.
briggs
is
what
i
would
apply,
is,
is
that
if
no
reasonable
officer
would
have
thought
the
warrant
should
issue,
then
i
would
say
liability--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--but
it's
a
fundamentally
different
situation,
your
honor,
because
there
you've
interposed
the
neutral,
detached
magistrate
which
is
generally--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--required
by
the
constitution.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
well,
because
he
has
taken
advantage
of
that
warrant
requirement.
and
that's
consistent
with
this
court's
policies
on
promoting
the
use
of
search
warrants.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
but
it's
a
unique
situation.
there
is
no
way
in
that
situation
that
you
could
come
closer
to
having
clearly
established
law
than
going
and
actually
putting
your
piece
of
paper
before
the
judge
and
asking
them
if
it
states
probable
cause.
it
is
like
having
a
controlling
precedent
in
a
case.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
yes.
but
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
difference
in
a
situation
where
the
officer
goes
and
gets
the
warrant
than
when
he
doesn't
go
and
get
the
warrant.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
no--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--no,
malley
is
an
application
case,
undoubtedly.
but
i
think
that
it
can
only...
it's
consistent
with
fourth
amendment
principles.
i
think
that
weighing
in
the
balances
is
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
enforce
these
constitutional
principles
as
they're
written;
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
be
used,
or
be
able
to
be
established
in
practice.
and
with
malley,
it
is
completely
consistent
with
all
the
doctrines
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
give
that
officer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt,
and
not
to
hold
him
liable,
because
he
went
and
got
a
warrant,
and
so--
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
--that's
true.
mr.
john
patrick
sheehy
that
is
true.
but
as
i
said
earlier,
it's
about
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
getting
a
precedent
controlling
the
case.
in
any
case,
i
believe
that
government
agents
have
been
held
liable
for
acts
similar
to
what
russell
anderson
did
in
this
case,
since
the
middle
ages.
at
least
sir
matthew
hale
would
say
that
if
you
search
for
a
fugitive
in
a
third
party's
home,
you'd
be
liable
if
he
wasn't
found
there.
this
isn't
a
startling
new
development
in
the
law
that
the
government
makes
it
out
to
be.
i
think
that
there's
an
old
saying
that
a
lawyer
in
my
office
uses
that
you
can't
put
a
shine
on
a
tennis
show,
or
you
can't
put
a
shine
on
a
sneaker.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
government's
trying
to
do
here
today.
they're
trying
to
actually
have
a
wholesale
lowering
of
these
standards,
rather
than
any
immunity.
because
under
their
doctrine,
you're
not
going
to
have
immunity.
you're
going
to
continue
to
be
subject
to
the
rigors
of
litigation.
and
there's
another
old
saying
that
he
has,
is
that
it
doesn't
take
long
to
rip
the
bark
off
a
rotten
log.
and
i
hope
that's
what
the
court
does
here
today
with
the
government's
arguments.
thank
you.
