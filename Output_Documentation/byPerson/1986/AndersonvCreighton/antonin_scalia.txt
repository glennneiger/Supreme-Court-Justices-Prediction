if
that's
really
what
we
meant
in
harlow,
we
really
should
have
put
it
differently
then,
shouldn't
we?
i
mean,
that's
a
strange
way
to
say
that,
clearly
established
constitutional
rights
of
which
he
should
have
known.
if
we
meant
what
you're
saying,
wouldn't
it
have
been
better
to
say
if
he
clearly
violated
clearly
established
constitutional
rights?
the
"clearly"
part
you're
talking
about
is
not
the
constitutional
right,
but
whether
what
was
done
constituted
a
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
don't
see
why
you
say
it
doesn't
come
up
in
the
warrant
context.
it
surely
comes
up
in
the
warrant
context
just
as
well.
let's
assume
that
the
facts
on
which
the
warrant
was
issued
do
not,
in
fact,
establish
probable
cause.
you'd
still
have
to
inquire
whether
it
was
close
enough
that
the
officer
could
reasonably
have
believed
that
they
established--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
still
have
to
inquire
into
his
subjective
judgment.
you're
just
saying
you
don't
have
to
inquire
into
what
facts
he
knew.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
you
do
about
the
argument
that,
at
least
when
you're
dealing
with
a
probable
cause
question,
the
slack
is
already
built
in?
you
don't
have
to
be
correct
that
there's
criminal
activity,
or
that
it's
the
product
of
a
crime;
you
just
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe,
which
means
a
reasonable
person
would
think
it's
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
the
common
law
standard
for
probable
cause
was
quite
more
lenient
than
the
standard
we've
developed
in
cases
that
are
principally
derived
in
the
context
of
whether
evidence
will
be
excluded
at
a
criminal
trial,
where
its
a
lot
easier
to
be
more
parsimonious
about
what
constitutes
probable
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we've
still
been
deciding
the
standard
primarily,
and
i'm
sure
we'll
continue
to
be
deciding
it,
primarily
in
cases
that
involve
the
exclusionary
rule.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i'd
draw
quite
the
same
line,
if
i
knew
that
everytime
i
drew
a
line
it
was
not
only
going
to
determine
whether
evidence
can
be
excluded
in
a
criminal
trial,
but
would
also
determine
whether
a
police
officer
who
proceeds
on
the
basis
of
this
much
belief
and
information
can
be
held
civilly
for
damages.
and
you're
telling
me
that
the
two
in
the
future
are
coextensive,
and
we
ought
to
draw
our
line
in
the
exclusionary
context
on
that
basis.
you
might
get
a
very
stingier
line
from
me,
at
least.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
of
conducting
it,
if
the
information
that
you
get
from
it
is
excludable?
i
mean,
surely,
that's
substantial
protection,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sheehy,
you...
it
is
the
consequence
of
what
you're
proposing,
however,
that
whenever
we
have
before
us
a
probable
cause
determination,
even
in
an
exclusionary
context,
the
question
we
ought
to
ask
ourselves
is,
was
this
action
so
far
beyond
what
it
was
reasonable
for
the
police
officer
to
do
that
we'd
be
willing
to
hold
the
police
officer
personally
liable
in
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
raises
an
interesting
question
here.
you're
asking
us
to
draw
a
line
between...
i
mean,
i
wonder
to
what
extent
harlow
itself
isn't
contrary
to
the
common
law
principles
you're
asking
us
to
embrace.
you're
avoiding
it
by
saying
what
we
should
do
is
draw
a
line
between
a
constitutional
principle
and
the
application
of
that
constitutional
principle;
right?
now,
what
is
the
constitutional
principle?
that
there
shall
be
no
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures?
i
suppose
at
one
level
that's
it.
or
that
you
cannot
generally
go
into
a
dwelling
place
without
a
warrant?
that's
a
little
more
specific.
if
you
do
it
without
a
warrant,
it's
unreasonable.
and
i
suppose
you
can
keep
on
reducing
that
principle
to
a
more
and
more
and
more
specific
principle
of
law.
now
where
is
it
that
you
think
harlow...
harlow
makes
the
cutoff,
at
what
level?
you
see,
i
don't
know
how
to
apply
the
principle
that
you're
asking
us
to
apply,
that
it's
only
the
general
constitutional
principle
of
law,
not
its
application,
that
harlow
applies
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that
malley
that
involved
an
application
of
the
law?
you
think
malley
involved
what
you
say
should
be
the
exclusive
application
of
harlow,
that
is,
clearly
established
principle
of
law.
malley
was
not
an
application
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
next
question
is,
if
malley
was
an
application
case,
what
isn't
an
application
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be,
but
it's
not
consistent
with
the
theory
that
you
only
apply
harlow
at
the
theoretical
stage
and
not
at
the
application
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
may
only
point.
