mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald,
this
court
held
that
government
officials
sued
for
constitutional
violations
are
entitled
to
immunity
as
long
as
their
conduct
was
objectively
reasonable.
the
case
presents
an
important
question
regarding
the
application
of
harlow,
a
question
that
has
particularly
significant
implications
for
actions
against
law
enforcement
officers
seeking
damages
for
alleged
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
events
at
issue
in
this
lawsuit
relate
to
the
investigation
of
a
bank
robbery
that
occurred
in
st.
paul,
minnesota,
on
november
11,
1983.
petitioner
russell
anderson
was
a
special
agent
with
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
assigned
to
the
bureau's
local
field
office.
he
investigated
the
robbery
by
obtaining
information
from
the
tellers
and
other
witnesses,
and
concluded
that
the
robbery
had
been
committed
by
vadaain
dixon.
agent
anderson
was
familiar
with
dixon
as
a
result
of
his
investigations
of
previous
bank
robberies
that
dixon
had
committed.
he
also
knew
that
dixon
had
escaped
two
days
earlier
from
a
halfway
house
in
which
he
was
confined
prior
to
sentencing
for
some
of
those
previous
bank
robberies.
because
of
what
he
viewed
as
dixon's
propensity
for
violence,
agent
anderson
determined
that
dixon
should
be
apprehended
as
soon
as
possible.
agent
anderson
and
several
of
the
local
st.
paul
police
officers
went
to
look
for
dixon
at
the
homes
of
his
mother
and
his
grandmother.
dixon
was
not
found
at
either
of
those
places.
based
upon
information
that
dixon's
wife
had
been
staying
with
respondents,
who
are
his
sister
and
brother-in-law,
and
that
a
car
resembling
respondent's
car
had
been
used
in
the
bank
robbery,
the
officers
then
went
to
respondents'
home.
respondents
did
not
consent
to
a
search
of
their
home,
but
the
officers
nonetheless
entered
and
searched
the
home
to
look
for
vadaain
dixon.
the
facts
concerning
the
execution
of
that
search
are
in
dispute,
but
vadaain
dixon
was
not
found.
responients
subsequently
commenced
this
action
for
damages
against
agent
anderson
and
the
st.
paul
police
officers,
alleging
that
the
warrantless
entry
in
their
home
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
agent
anderson
moved
for
summary
judgment,
and
the
district
court
granted
his
motion,
holding
that
the
entry
into
the
home
was
lawful
because
it
was
justified
by
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances.
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
the
district
court's
judgment
but
found
that
factual
disputes
precluded
a
determination
on
summary
judgment
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
agent
anderson's
conduct.
the
court
of
appeals
then
turned
to
consider
an
issue
that
was
not
decided
by
the
district
court,
whether
agent
anderson
was
entitled
to
immunity
under
this
court's
decision
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald.
the
court
held
that
agent
anderson
was
not
entitled
to
immunity,
because
the
legal
standard
governing
his
conduct,
the
requirement
of
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances
to
execute
the
warrantless
search,
had
been
clearly
established
at
the
time
of
the
challenged
search.
and
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
for
a
trial
concerning
the
merits
of
respondents'
fourth
amendment
claim.
now
let
me
stress
at
the
outset
the
limited
question
that
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
we
do
not
seek
review
of
the
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
regarding
the
merits
of
respondents'
fourth
amendment
claim.
and
we
do
not
seek
a
determination
by
this
court--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
sir,
we
do
not
seek
a
determination
in
this
court
about
whether
or
not
the
district
court
properly
granted
summary
judgment.
we
haven't
sought...
we
do
not
raise
that
issue
in
our
cert
petition.
and
so
the
merits
of
the
substantive
question,
whether
agent
anderson
actually
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
are
not
before
the
court.
and
we
similarly
do
not
seek
a
determination
by
the
court
as
to
whether
agent
anderson
is
entitled
to
immunity
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
what
we
are
seeking
is
review
of
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
agent
anderson
was
not
entitled
to
immunity
simply
because
the
legal
standard
was
settled.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
simply
applied
the
wrong
test
in
determining
whether
immunity
was
appropriate.
we
think
the
question
is
not
whether
the
legal
standard
is
appropriate,
but
whether
the
particular
officer...
a
reasonable
officer
in
agent
anderson's
position
should
have
known
that
the
conduct
was
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
even
consider
that
question,
and
we
think
therefore
improperly
deprived
agent
anderson
of
his
immunity
defense.
now
the
starting
point
in
determining
how
harlow
should
be
applied
in
this
context
is
the
court's
decision
in
harlow
itself.
and
what--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
they
certainly
did
they.
they
certainly
applied
the
wrong
standard.
and
it
does
appear
to
us
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor,
but
we
think
they
were
wrong
in
saying
that
was
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
we
in
fact...
we
submit
that
further
proceedings
are
entirely
appropriate.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
we'd
be
very
happy
if
the
court
did
in
this
case
just
what
it
did
in
malley
v.
briggs,
which
is
to
point
out
what
the
ultimate
question
is
on
immunity,
and
then
remand
the
case
to
allow
the
district
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
standard
has
been
met
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
guess
we
differ
about
what
the
view
of
the
judgment
is.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
is
that
the
immunity
issue
is
out
of
the
case
entirely.
it's
not...
on
the
court
of
appeals'
view
of
the
immunity
question,
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
wouldn't
have
been
required
because
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
it
was
simply
a
question
of
whether
the
law
was
established
or
not.
and
the
court
said,
the
legal
standard
was
established,
so
that's
the
end
of
immunity.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
as
long
as
the
court...
i
guess
we
just
have
a
different--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
as
long
as
what
the
court
of
appeals...
as
long
as
a
portion
of
that
judgment
doesn't
take
the
issue
out
of
the
case.
if
the
court
reads
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
as
leaving
that
question
open,
then
we'd
be
perfectly
happy
with
the
judgment
being
affirmed.
if
the
court...
on
our
reading
of
the
opinion,
that...
the
judgment
disposes
of
that
issue,
so
we
think
that
the
judgment
has
to
be
vacated
to
allow
the
district
court
to
conduct
those
further
proceedings.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
i
agree.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
our
position
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
was
wrong,
and
that
it
has
to
be
either
vacated
or
reversed.
justice
stevens--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
justice
stevens
question,
i
think,
posited
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
foreclose
further
proceedings
on
the
immunity
issue,
and
in
that
technical
sense,
i
guess,
its
judgment
would
have
left
those
proceedings
open
in
the
district
court.
but
we
think,
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
and
what
has
to
be
set
right
is
what
the
proper
legal
standard
is
to
guide
a
court
considering
immunity
questions
in
a
fourth
amendment
context
such
as
this
case.
and
we
think
that
the
resolution
of
that
question
turns
upon
the
standard
that
this
court
set
forth
in
harlow,
which
is
that
a
government
official
is
entitled
to
immunity
unless
his
conduct
violated
clearly
established
statutory
or
constitutional
rights
of
which
a
reasonable
person
would
have
known.
and
in
order
to
decide
when
a
right
is
clearly
established,
we
think
it's
necessary
to
look
to
the
reasons
that
the
court
adopted
this
immunity
test
in
the
first
place.
and
harlow
makes
clear
that
there
are
two
considerations
that
are
involved.
on
the
one
side
is
the
interest
in
permitting
recovery
for
constitutional
violations;
and
on
the
other
side
is
the
need
to
protect
government
officials
from
liability
so
they
will
not
be
reluctant
to
vigorously
perform
their
duties.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
we
think
that
the
question
here
is
whether
on
the
facts
of
this
case
it
was
clearly
established
that
respondents
had
a
right
not
to...
for
officer
anderson
not
to
conduct
a
warrantless
search
of
their
home.
so
the
right
in
this
case
doesn't
turn
just
on
the
legal
standard,
it
turns
on
how
the
legal
standard
interacted
with
the
particular
facts
here.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
the
court...
although
that
particular
phrase
may
have
been
less
than
clear,
the
court
in
other
places
in
harlow
specifically
made
clear
that
the
question
was
whether
the
officer
reasonably
could
have
known
that
what
he
was
going
to
do
violated
the
constitution.
in
another
portion
of
the
opinion,
for
example,
the
court
said,
where
an
official
could
be
expected
to
know
that
certain
conduct
would
violate
statutory
or
constitutional
rights,
he
should
be
made
to
hesitate.
and
it
made
clear
that
in
that
context,
that...
that
that's
the
context
in
which
a
government
officer
should
be
held
liable,
and
only
that
context.
so
harlow,
we
think,
makes
it
quite
clear
that
the
way
the
court
struck
the
balance
between
liability
and
immunity
was
to
say
that
only
where
an
officer
reasonably
could
have
known
that
what
he
was
about
to
do
was
unconstitutional
should
he
be
held
liable
in
damages
for
that
action.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
yes.
i
think
that's
right,
justice
o'connor,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
malley
v.
briggs,
where
it
was
dealing
with
a
fourth
amendment
situation.
and
it
said
quite
specifically
that
the
inquiry
was
whether
a
reasonable,
well
trained
officer,
in
the
defendant's
position,
would
have
known
that
the
affidavit
failed
to
established
probable
cause.
and
we
think
it's
clear
that
what
that
standard
requires
is
to
look
at
the
particular
facts
of
the
case,
and
to
decide
whether
a
reasonable...
any
reasonable
officer
in
that
situation
would
have
known
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
go
ahead
and
do
what
the
defendant
actually
did.
and
only
in
that
situation,
if
that
inquiry
is
answered
affirmatively,
that
any
reasonable
officer
would
have
known
that
it
was
unconstitutional,
then
immunity
fails
and
liability
is
permissible.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
a
subjective
inquiry
will
be
necessary
in
every
case.
first
of
all,
in
the
warrant
context,
the
relevant
facts,
of
course,
are
what
are
in
the
affidavit.
so
there's
no
problem
in
the
warrant
context
with
subjective...
with
the
need
for
a
subjective
inquiry.
in
the
warrantless
context,
of
course,
the
relevant
facts
are
the
facts
that
are
known
to
the
officers
that
conduct
the
search.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
it's
a
two-step
process.
first,
the
relevant
pool
of
facts
has
to
be
ascertained.
and
then
the
question
is,
taking
those
facts,
would
any
reasonable
officer
have
known
that
the
challenge...
that
what
the
officer
went
ahead
and
did
was
unconstitutional.
so,
although
that
initial
inquiry,
gathering
the
pool
of
relevant
facts,
does
require
some...
it
is
not
a
wholly
legal
inquiry,
it
requires
some
looking
at
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
the
court's
made
clear
that
that's
irrelevant
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
we
think
it
would
be
irrelevant
here.
the
only
part
of
the
inquiry
that's
subjective
is
simply
gathering
the
pool
of
relevant
facts.
and
those
are
then
examined
on
an
objective
basis.
but
even
though
that
inquiry
is
necessary
in
some
cases,
we
don't
think
it
will
be
necessary
in
every
case.
first
of
all,
it
may
be
that
an
officer
will
file
an
affidavit,
and
there
won't
be
a
dispute
about
whether
or
not
he
knew
those
facts.
or
it
may
be
possible
for
a
court
to
say,
even
if
he
knew
all
those
facts,
that
still
is
not
enough
to
entitle
him
to
immunity.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
sir,
and
i
was
just...
i
was
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
whether
a
subjective...
something
that
wasn't
on
an
objective
piece
of
paper
would
be
required.
in
the
warrant
context,
the
pool
of
facts
doesn't
have
to
be
obtained
by
either
an
affidavit
from
the
officer
or
deposing
the
officer
because
it's
the
facts
that
are
in
the
affidavit.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
and
that
second
question,
the
question
about
whether
his
judgment
is
reasonable,
doesn't
look
to
his
judgment.
it's
a
judgment
about
what
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
done,
confronted
with
those
facts.
and
so
that
particular...
that
phase
of
it
will
be
easy
for
a
court;
it
doesn't
require
any
fact-finding.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
it's
true,
and
the
aclu
and
respondents
do
make
that
point
in
their
brief.
but
we
think,
although
both
inquiries
are
denominated
reasonableness
tests,
actually,
they're
quite
different.
and
it's
something
that
the
court
has
recognized
in
the
malley
case,
and
also
in
leon,
where
the
court,
in
both
cases,
the
court
has
recognized
that
although
conduct
can
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
and
thus
be
unreasonable
in
that
sense,
it
may
have
been
objectively
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
believe
that
that
conduct
was
lawful,
and
therefore
he
would
be
entitled
to
immunity.
and
we
think
that
same
distinction
applies
here.
the...
let
me
just
say
one
more
word
about
the
difference
between
the
two
tests.
the
difference,
i
think,
is
that
the...
the
objective
reasonable
test
in
harlow
is
not
a
general
reasonableness
inquiry,
it's
an
inquiry
that
takes
as
its
guide
the
established
case
law,
and
sees
what
the
officer
could
have
thought
based
on
that.
whereas
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
inquiry,
under
the
probable
cause
standard,
for
example,
is
a
more
general
type
of
inquiry,
directed
toward
what
a
prudent
person
would
have
thought.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
obviously
we
think
that
agent
anderson
is
entitled
to
immunity,
and
we
think
that
under
the
proper
standard,
that's
what
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
will
hold.
it's
hard
to
predict
in
advance
exactly
what
might
happen
in
the
lower
courts.
if
there's
some
error
that
we
think
this
court
should
review,
we
might
well
be
back.
but
we
think
that
at
this
stage
what's
important
is
to
get
right
the
legal
standard
that
those
courts
have
to
apply
in
deciding
immunity
in
this
context,
and
then
it
will
be
necessary
to
see
whether
they
in
fact
apply
that
standard
correctly.
let
me
just
turn
for
one
moment
to
the
rule
advanced
by
respondents,
because
we
think
it
makes
clear
why
the
harlow
standard
has
to
be
interpreted
in
the
manner
for
which
we
contend...
and
in
the
manner
that
the
court
applied
it
in
the
malley
case.
the
rule
that
respondents
support
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
is
that
the
existence
of
a
settled
legal
standard
just
automatically
eliminates
all
immunity
for
actions
taken
where
that
standard
applies.
and
we
think
it's
clear
that
that
would
work
quite
a
breathtaking
reduction
in
the
immunity
available
to
government
officials.
for
example,
just
taking
law
enforcement
officers
as
a
single
example,
settled
fourth
amendment
standards
govern
a
lot
of
routine
law
enforcement
activities,
such
as
searches,
seizures,
and
investigatory
stops.
and
under
the
court
of
appeals
rule,
officers
would
never
be
entitled
to
immunity
in
connection
with
any
of
those
activities,
and
thus
an
officer
would
have
no
leeway
for
miscalculation
in
the
performance
of
those
duties.
everytime
he
misjudged
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment,
even
if
it
was
a
very
close
question,
he
would
be
required
to
answer
in
damages.
and
we
think
holding
officers
to
that
standard
is
counter
to
the
court's
repeated
affirmation
that
harlow
allows
ample
room
for
mistaken
judgments,
and
assures
immunity
for
all
but
the
plainly
incompetent
or
those
that
knowingly
violate
the
law.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
the
probable
cause
standard
assumes
that
officers
will
be
able
to
act
up
until
the
limit
of
where
probable
cause
exists.
the
reason
that
the
standard
is
set
low
is
because
often
at
the
initial
stage
of
an
investigation
an
officer
can't
have
enough
facts
to
know
precisely
what's
going
on.
and
what
society
has
decided
is
that
where
the
officer
has
facts
that
amount
to
probable
cause,
even
if
they're
just
barely
probable
cause,
his
action
is
legally
correct.
and
if
he
was
required
to
be
absolutely
right
in
that
judgment
or
answer
in
damages,
an
officer
would
obviously
not...
would
be
quite
reluctant
to
take
action
unless
he
was
quite
sure
he
was
way
over
the
boundary,
because
the
alternative
would
be
for
him
to
be
liable
in
damages
for
any
misjudgment.
so
we
think
the
effect
of
that
approach
is
necessarily
going
to
be
to
make
officers
extremely
reluctant
to
act
unless
they
have
something
that
is
quite
a
lot
more
than
probable
cause,
and
to
harm
law
enforcement
activity
as
a
result.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
justice
white,
the
court's
immunity
decisions
rest
on...
rest
on
the
policy
determination
that
without
immunity
vigorous
law
enforcement
will
be
chilled.
and
so
we
think
that
that
protection,
that
in
fact
a
rule
that
requires
officers
to
guess
right
every
single
time
will
be
quite
effective
in
deterring
them
because--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--if
it's
appropriate
in
the
particular
situation.
obviously,
there
may
well
be
situations
where
it's
better...
where
the
investigation
is
ongoing,
and
they
may
want
to
continue
surveillance
and
hope
to
get
additional
information
for
trial.
so
they
may
not
want
to
act
right
away.
but
if
there
is
a
danger,
if
in
their
judgment,
it's
the
appropriate
time
to
act,
either
to
ensure
that
a
defendant...
a
suspect
is
captured,
or
to
avoid
harm
to
the
public,
then
we
think
as
long
as
they
meet
the...
reasonably
believe
they
meet
the
constitutional
standard,
they
should
be
able
to
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because
that
will
necessarily
chill
them
and
make
them
reluctant
to
act
unless
they
believe
they
have
a
margin
for
safety.
they
won't
act...
a
reasonable
officer
in
that
situation
might
be
reluctant
to
act
where
he
thinks
he
has
enough
for
probable
cause.
he
might
want
to
be
very,
very
sure
because
he
doesn't
want
to
end
up
five
years
later
paying
a
very
large
damage
judgment.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
an
officer,
we
think,
has
an
incentive
to
act
according
to
the
constitution,
just
because
that
is
the
requirement
of
his
office,
a,
and
b,
because
the
goal
is
to
apprehend
someone
and
convict
them
later.
so
if
he
takes
an
action
that
violates
the
constitution,
the
evidence
may
very
well
be
suppressed
later.
so
that,
and
the
possibility
of
damages,
gives
him
we
think
a
significant
incentive
to
act
properly.
the
question
is
whether
damages...
the
threat
of
damages
for
any
miscalculation
will
skew
the
incentive
so
much
that
he
will
not
be
willing
to
act
just
when
he
thinks
that
what
he--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
has
already
made
that
determination
in
the
pierson
v.
ray
case
quite
well--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
in
malley
v.
briggs,
specifically,
the
court
said
even
where
an
officer
applies
for
a
warrant
and
the
warrant
does
not...
is
not
justified
by
probable
cause,
then
the
people
who
are
arrested
pursuant
to
the
warrant
later
bring
an
action
against
the
officer--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
the
court
in
malley
didn't
rely
on
that
rationale,
and
we
think
that
the
damages--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i
have
to
yield
to
you
in
my
knowledge
of
what
the
common
law
does.
but
i
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
it
also
provides
for...
it
just
protects
the
individual--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--under
the
fourth
amendment,
it
protects
the
individual's
privacy
and
other
interests
against
random
intrusion
by
the
state.
so
it
really
is
a
buffer
between
the
state
and
the
individual.
and
here
all
we're
saying--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
there
still
is
the
legal
standard...
remains
untouched.
the
question
just
is,
when
an
officer
should
be
required
to
answer
in
damages
for
his
conduct.
and
we
think
that
what...
the
way
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
has
developed
in
this
country
is
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
act
as
long
as
it
has,
for
example,
probable
cause.
and
the
question
is
whether
we're
going
to
skew
the
incentives
so
that
in
fact
the
government
won't
act
in
that
situation,
because
the
individual
officers--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
and
we
think
that
in
harlow--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
the
individual
does
not
have
less
protection,
the
fourth
amendment
standard
remains
unchanged.
the
remedy
for
that
violation
may
not
be
available.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
if
he's
a
criminal
defendant,
he
will
be
entitled
to
have
a
suppression
hearing
to
raise
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
harlow
and
malley,
the
court
has
we
think
made
that
policy
judgment
and
decided
that
independent
and
they
be
entitled
to
act
unless
their
conduct
is...
unconstitutional.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
that
may
well
be
true,
where
the
judge
is
not
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
a
police
officer
is
going
to
be
answerable
in
damages
for
his
conduct.
and
we
think
that's
another
reason
why
here,
there
should
be
some
more
protection
for
the
officer.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
unless
the
sneaker
needs
any
further
polish,
i'll
rest
on
our
submission.
