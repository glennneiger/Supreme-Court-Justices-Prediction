mr.
pincus,
can
i
just
interrupt
you?
do
you
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
he
simply
does
not
have
an
immunity
defense,
or
he
doesn't
have
one
that
can
be
decided
on
summary
judgment?
well,
justice
stevens,
the
way
we
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
that
it
simply
disposed
of
the
immunity
issue
altogether.
and
i
guess
in
the
passage
of
the
opinion
that's
reprinted
on
pages
16a
and
17a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
states
that
officer
anderson
has
cited
no
persuasive
reason
why
he
could
not
reasonably
have
been
aware
of
this
clearly
established
law.
and
we
think
that's
a
determination
that
the
immunity
issue
is
just
out
of
the
case.
well,
he
hasn't
done
that
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings.
but
i
don't
know
that
that
would
have
foreclosed
him
from
making
a
further
record.
because
as
you
point
out,
the
district
court
decided
the
case
on
the
constitutional
issue,
said
there
was
no
probable
cause
and
no
exigent
circumstances
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
it
didn't
even
reach
the
immunity
issue.
so
i'm
not
clear
whether
the
record
had
been
fully
developed
on
the
question
of
whether
he
was
entitled
to
immunity
or
not.
your
submission
i
take
it
is
that
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
may
not
have
finally
decided
the
immunity
question,
they
applied
the
wrong
standard
in
guiding
the
district
court
as
to
how
to
decide.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
want
the
judgment
affirmed
with
an
explanation
of
what
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
should
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
the
judgment
is
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you...
if
we
wrote
an
opinion
that
said
in
determining
whether
he's
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
you've
got
to
look
at
the
facts
as
well
as
the
legal
standard,
and
therefore,
the
judgment
is
affirmed,
you'd
be
happy
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
explains
what
has
to
be
done
on
the
remand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pincus,
if
we
go
back
to
the
common
law,
wasn't
the
very
purpose
of
the
probable
cause
requirement
to
protect
the
officer
from
the
danger
of
making
mistakes,
because
we
know
he
can't
guess
right
every
time?
and
what
the
english
common
law
developed
was
that
if
there's
probable
cause,
then
he
has
a
defense
to
a
claim
for
false
arrest
or
something
like
that.
why
do
we
need
a...
why
shouldn't
the
same
standard
apply
to
our
officers
that
apply
to
common
law?
it's
the
very
same
purpose
for
the
rule.
am
i
not
right
that
at
common
law,
if
a
magistrate
arrested
someone,
he
had
a
defense
if
he
had
probable
cause?
he
didn't
have
to
guess
right
everytime;
he
just
had
to
have
probable
cause.
that
was
the
reason
for
the
probable
cause
requirement.
what
you're
saying
is,
we
ought
to
have
a
second
layer
to
give
our
officers
greater
protection
that
officers
had
at
common
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
probable
cause
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
there
you
have
the
intervention
of
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
in
that
situation;
but
here
you
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
that
your
view
would
give
the
law
enforcement
officers
here
an
additional
layer
of
protection
over
and
above
that
which
the
probable
cause
determination
originally
gave
them
at
common
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
suppose
the
purpose
of
the
probable
cause
requirement
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
warrantless
area,
in
the
warrantless
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
we
should
sacrifice
that
protection
here,
because
the
officer...
i
mean,
you're
saying
they
should
have
a
lesser
degree
of
protection
here
than
they
had
at
common
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
individual
won
't
be
protected
in
that
situation.
it's
both
sides
of
the
same
coin.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
in
effect
saying
that
they
should
have
less...
the
individuals
have
less
protection
than
they
had
at
common
law,
and
the
officer
should
have
greater
leeway
than
they
would
have
at
common
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean,
after
the
search
has
been
conducted,
he
can
say,
i
know
it
was
unconstitutional,
but
i
can't
do
anything
about
it.
what
kind
of
protection
is
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
think
we're
more
concerned
with
the
people
who
are
not
criminal
defendants,
as
is
the
case
in
this
case.
these
people
weren't
criminal
defendants.
