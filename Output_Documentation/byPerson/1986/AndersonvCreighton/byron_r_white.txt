justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
apply
the...
you
don't
say
that
they
were
wrong
in
saying
that
the
legal
standard
was
clearly
established,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
well,
you
would
be
very
happy
if
we
said
there's
more
to
it
than
that,
and
the
record
isn't
fully
developed,
and
go
back
and...
you
don't
object
to
further
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
justice
stevens'
point,
you'd
be
very
happy
if
we
just
said
that...
affirmed
that
there's
more
to
it
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
objectively
whether
a
reasonable
well
trained
officer
would--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn't
any
real
necessity,
though,
to
equate
admissibility
of
evidence,
where
the
aim
is
to
deter
illegal
action,
and
you
wouldn't
deter
anything
where
an
officer
could
reasonably
have
believed
he
was
satisfying
probable
cause
and
immunity
questions--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
officers
are
bound
to
do...
anytime
they
honestly
think
there's
probable
cause,
they
feel
duty
bound
to
act,
i
suppose?
if
they
reasonably
believe
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
shouldn't...
you
shouldn't
make
them
liable
for
damages
because?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
good
officer
in
the
same
position,
he
may
have
been
stuck
with
damages
the
last
time,
but
why
wouldn't
he
act
on
the
same
facts
or
similar
facts
again,
the
same
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
i
take
it
that
you
say
that
the
immunity
should...
where
the
law
is
clearly
established,
and
it's
just
an
argument
about
the
validity
of
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment,
immunity
just
has
to
turn
on
what
the
ultimate
decision
is
on
whether
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
that's
so
even
if,
say,
the
fifth
circuit
divides
eight
to
seven
and
it
comes
up
here
and
we
divide
five
to
four,
and
four
justices
think
there
was
no
violation
and
five
justices
do.
you
say
if
the
five
decide,
the
fourth
amendment
is
violated,
and
the
officer
then
is
liable
in
damages.
that
is
the
end
result
of
your
argument,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
false...
in
a
false
arrest
case,
you'd
take
the
same
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under...
is
that
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
in
the
states,
when
somebody
sues
for
false
arrest,
is
that
the
normal
rule
of
the
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
does
that
mean?
you
had
to
prove
your
legal
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
officer
was
always
liable
at
common
law
for
false
arrest
and
for
damages
if
he
didn't
have
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
part
of
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
if
he
had
gotten
a
warrant,
your
basic
argument
would
be
different
about
clearly
applied
law?
that
would
just
be
an
application.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
your
argument...
your
argument
certainly
reaches
warranted
situations;
that
you
determine
immunity
only
based
on
whether
the
law
is
clearly
established.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
the
officer
gets
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
warrant
is
held
invalid
because
of
lack
of
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
now...
if
it
was
a
reasonable
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
reasonable
error
by
the
officer?
a
reasonable
error
by
the
magistrate?
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
argument
on
the
other
side
with
respect
to
situations
where
there's
no
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
made
an
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
made
an
error.
and
it's
decided
here
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
why
not...
why
isn't
the
officer
liable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
made
a
mistake
on
probable
cause
by
even
asking
the
magistrate
to
get
the
warrant.
