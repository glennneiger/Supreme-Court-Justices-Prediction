chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-1520,
anderson
against
creighton.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
a
particular
defendant
could
not...
the
government
officer
could
not
prevail
simply
by
testifying
that
he
subjectively
thought
there
was
probable
cause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
romvoire
situation
when
you're
dealing
with
an
area
like
the
fourth
amendment,
that...
the
legal
standards
are
those
of
a
reasonable
person,
and
then
you
get
to
the
question
of,
even
though
they
didn't
satisfy
that,
could
they
satisfy
the
objective
belief
or
objective
view
of
another
reasonable
man.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
sheehy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
then
that
immunity
is
applicable
or
available
only
when
there's
been
a
change
in
the
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that's
reconcilable
with
malley?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
malley
was
an
action
for
damages,
wasn't
it?
it
was
not
an
action
to
suppress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
surely
no
doubt
about
the
law
in
malley.
and
yet
we...
there
was
no
new
development
in
the
law.
and
yet
we
said
there
that
qualified
immunity
would
be
available.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
perfectly
true
so
far
as
the
bill
of
rights
is
concerned.
but
the
constitution
as
a
whole
empowers
the
government
to
govern,
as
well
as
giving
individual
rights.
and
the
idea
is
to
find
the
proper
balance;
not
to
exalt
one
at
the
expense
of
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
matter
what
the
arguments
on
each
side
are,
you
resolve
it
in
favor
of
the
claim
of
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
probable
cause
standard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
pierson
v.
ray
didn't
actually
say
the
officer
would
have
immunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
certainly
said
that
he
would
not
have
to
pay
damages,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
you
suggesting
that
pierson
v.
ray
held
only
that
if
there
was
no
constitutional
violation,
the
officer
would
not
have
to
pay
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
certainly
is
not
the
way
i
have
read
it.
i'll
certainly
go
back
and
reread
it.
i
thought
it
stood
for
the
proposition
that
even
though
there
was
a
constitutional
violation,
an
officer
could
not
always
be
held
if
there
was
good
faith
and
reasonable
belief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we've
never
addressed
the
question
of
whether,
in
the
probable
cause
nonwarrant
context,
the
leon
principle
would
extend
to
not
requiring
a
suppression
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
your
understanding
of
leon
that
if
we
were
to
apply
leon
to
a
situation
like
this,
then
is
the
answer
here
that
there
would
be
no
constitutional
violation,
or
that
there's
immunity,
or
that
there's
not
immunity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
gave
you
three
choices.
which
do
you
take?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
what
is
a
necessary
conclusion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
said
in
malley
v.
briggs
that
the
magistrate's
determination...
some
other
people
said,
i
should
say...
doesn't
conclude
the
issue,
that
if
it
was
unreasonable
to
present
the
affidavit,
then
it's
no
good.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sheehy.
mr.
pincus,
you
have
three
minutes
left
in
which
to
further
shine
the
sneaker.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
