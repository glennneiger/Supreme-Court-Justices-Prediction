well,
mr.
pincus,
what's
wrong
with
justice
scalia's
formulation
of
the
standard?
harlow,
of
course,
didn't
come
up
in
a
fourth
amendment
context.
all
we
had
was
a
legal
principle
to
be
resolved.
and
fourth
amendment
search
cases
inevitably
result
in
factual
disputes.
and
as
i
understand
it,
justice
scalia
asked,
well,
should
the
standard
in
harlow
then
mean
that
conduct
which
clearly
violates
clearly
established
constitutional
rights,
that's
the
inquiry
you
have
to
make.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
aclu
brief
suggests
that
under
your
test
it
would
get
us
back
to
a
subjective
inquiry
in
every
case.
would
you
like
to
comment
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
pincus,
if
on
remand,
the
court
applying
the
proper
standard
concludes
that
on
these
facts
the
action
was
not
reasonable,
will
you
be
back?
or
is
that
a
position
you're
willing
to
accept
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
possible,
i
suppose,
that
the
standard
of
reasonableness
for
a
substantive
fourth
amendment
violation
could
be
a
different
standard
than
reasonableness
for
purposes
of
financial
liability
of
the
officer.
and
that
is
pretty
much
what
malley
v.
briggs
indicates,
i
guess.
