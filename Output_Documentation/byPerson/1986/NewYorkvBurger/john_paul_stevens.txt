justice
stevens
may
i
just
on
that
last
argument,
i'm
not
really
sure
i
follow
it
because
if,
as
your
opponent
contends,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
then
the
dismantler
who
keeps
the
records
could
show
them
and
say,
but
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
look
at
anything.
justice
stevens
so
then,
he's
really
no
better
off
by
not
keeping
records
than
if
he
kept
records,
so
he
has
not
created
an
additional
expectation
of
privacy
by
refusing
to
obey
the
law?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
give
him
any
higher
expectation
of
privacy
than
one
who
keeps
records
and
says,
i
am
going
to
violate
the
law
by
not
letting
you
see
the
vehicle
because
i
think
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
it's
certainly
not
a
frivolous
argument.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
mr.
mahler,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
supposing
they
amended
the
statute
to
provide
that
these
searches
shall
be
conducted
by...
a
police
officer
should
have
an
administrative
warrant
in
his
possession
at
the
time
he
makes
such
search,
and
the
commissioner
or
police
is
authorized
to
issue
administrative
warrants
designating
the
order
in
which
searches
shall
be
made,
but
he
can
just
pick
anybody
out
of
a
hat
and
say,
i
want
you
to
search
these
five
or
six
people
today.
but
then,
you
just
have
them
grind
out
an
administrative
warrant
on
a
form
and
sign
it.
would
that
make
the
statute
constitutional?
justice
stevens
what
if
they
refined
it
by
saying,
there
shall
be
created
within
the
police
department
an
auto
inspection
division...
an
auto
inspection
administration
headed
by
a
lieutenant
who
has
been
on
the
force
in
auto
work
for
five
years
or
more,
and
then
he
had
the
authority
to
give
the
warrant?
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
amend
it
once
more.
say
they
created
a
new
administration
which
shall
be
composed
of
those
officers
who
heretofore
have
been
engaged
in
work
of
this
kind
at
the
police
department
and
the
former
lieutenant
in
charge
of
that
division
shall
be
the
new
administrator,
and
that
in
order
to
qualify
for
that
job
you
have
to
have
five
years
of
police
work
in
auto
crimes.
would
then
it
be
constitutional?
justice
stevens
well,
it's
to
conduct
a
lot
of
inspections
which
will
discourage
people
from
engaging
in
this
sort
of
activity,
in
criminal
activity,
and
catch
them
if
they
do
engage
in
it?
justice
stevens
so,
it's
not
that
the
absence
of
an
administrative
warrant;
it's
the
fact
they
used
police
officers?
