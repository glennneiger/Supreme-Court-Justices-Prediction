mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
collection
of
new
york
state
appellate
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
amply
demonstrate
the
infirmities
of
the
statute
under
consideration.
we
submit
this
was
an
ordinary
type
warrantless
search
by
regular
new
york
city
police
officers
without
any
discernible
administrative
function,
who
did
not
even
consult
with
any
administrative
agency
either
before
or
after
they
took
their
action.
and
petitioner
conceded
in
a
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
brief
that
the
immediate
purpose
of
the
action
was
to
uncover
evidence
of
crime,
and
that
led
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
which
quoted
that
concession
in
their
opinion
and
led
them
to
construe
the
statutes...
it's
really
convenient
devices
to
enforce
the
penal
law
without
a
warrant.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
yes,
and
mr.
chief
justice,
the
petitioner
falls
back
to
try
to
dilute
that
concession
in
this
court,
falls
back
on
the
argument
that
there
may
be
some
secondary
administrative
value
to
these
so-called
inspections.
well,
that's
true
in
any
case.
any
time
you
have
a
criminal...
a
search
for
criminal
evidence
where
the
target
is
a
licensee,
it
could
be
a
law
office
and
if
you
go
in
without
probable
cause
and
you
search
a
law
office
for
criminal
evidence
and
you
find
criminal
evidence
and
you
report
it
to
the
bar
association,
conceivably
it's
going
to
have
some
administrative
effect
secondarily.
but
this
court
in
none
of
the
line
of
cases
has
ever
held
that
where
the
immediate
purpose,
the
very
immediate
purpose--
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
--well,
it
was
their
prime
goal
in
this
case,
was
to
uncover
evidence
of
crime,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
when
the
prime
goal
was
to
uncover
evidence
of
crime,
that
the
search
warrant
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
unnecessary.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
that's
their
prime
goal.
i
think
the
prime
goal
under
an
administrative
scheme
is
administrative.
the
petitioner
relies
heavily,
for
instance,
on
biswell.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
no.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
that's
correct,
but
that's
administrative.
find
the
evidence
that
you
did
it,
is
criminal.
that's
the...
there's
a
distinction
between
what
starts
out
as
an
administrative
scheme
and
what
is
directly
seeking
to
recover
evidence
of
criminality.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
no.
i
respectfully
disagree.
i
think
it's
to...
step
one
i
agree
with,
but
i
think
it's
to
prevent
the
traffic
in
the
stolen
vehicle.
but
for
step
two,
to
find
out
if
they
possessed
the
stolen
vehicle,
i
think
that
requires
a
warrants.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
well,
if
we
can
go
back
to
biswell
which
is
so
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner,
petitioner
ignores
the
evolution
of
the
law
in
the
most
recent
cases
of
the
court,
by
the
way,
but
i'll
get
back
to
that.
in
biswell
and
in
colonnade,
i
believe,
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
and
firearms
officers
in
those
cases,
they
were
actually
administrative
enforcement
officers
without
general
police
duties,
and
the--
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
because
it
comes
from
an
administrative
agency.
it's
supposed
to
be
an
administrative
statute.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we're
trying
to
bring
out
that
an
administrative
statute
serves
a
strictly
administrative
purpose.
it's
not
to
recover
evidence
of
crime.
it's
perhaps
to--
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
--yes.
in
fact,
the
person
who
says
that
he
doesn't
have
a
police
book
and
who
is
taken
to
be
a
dismantler
is
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
under
new
york
state
law.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
yes,
but
the
difference
between
that
and
the
actual
search
for
evidence
of
the
crime
is
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
saw
fit
to
draw
the
line
at
that
point
and
to
say
that
it
would
be
quite
all
right
for
the
police
to
ask
to
inspect
the
records,
but
not
to
go
further
to
try
to
seek
out
criminal
evidence.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
well,
they
are
not.
in
this
particular
instance,
under
these
statutes,
if
the
man
doesn't
keep
records
he's
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
and
conceivably
the
police
at
that
point
can
go
and
seek
a
search
warrant
based
on
the
fact
that
he
obviously
has
a
junkyard
filled
with
automobile
parts
and
hasn't
catalogued
them
and
hasn't
kept
the
police
book.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
treasury
agent,
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
yes,
but
mr.
justice
white,
again
a
treasury
agent--
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
--well,
that's
true.
in
that
case
he
was
accompanied
by
a
policeman.
but
the
facts
of
that
case...
that
case
did
not
turn
upon
that
fact.
the
agent
was
still--
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
--he
was
connected--
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
--the
treasury
agent
again,
mr.
justice
white,
is
someone
who
is
an
administrative
enforcement
agent.
he
actually
comes
out
of
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
he
has
power
of
arrest,
but
not
general
police
duties.
the
same
way,
an
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
person.
he's
there
to
enforce
an
administrative
statute,
not
to
gather
evidence
of
crime,
as
we
had
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
well,
that
gets
to
part
two.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
yes.
well,
that
gets
to
part
two
of
the
argument,
actually.
if
i
just
may
delineate
between
the
two
statutes,
clearly
there
are
two
statutes
at
hand
here.
clearly
the
city
statute
cannot
be
conceived
as
being
constitutional
in
any
way,
shape
or
form.
the
city
statute
merely
is
authority
for
the
police
commissioner
to
conduct
his
police
duties.
it
really
authorizes
nobody
else
but
the
police
commissioner.
it
doesn't
speak
of
anybody
in
an
administrative
capacity.
and,
415-a
of
the
state
law,
the
vehicle
dismantler
law,
that
authorizes
any
police
officer
to
search.
that
doesn't
really
try
to
even
separate
out
a
regular
police
officer
with
general
police
duties
from
anyone
else
that
wants
to
use
this
particular
statute
to
make
warrantless
searches.
the
auto
crime
division
in
new
york
state
have
a
wonderful
gift
in
this
statute.
it
certainly
separates
them
from
any
other
police
officer.
it
certainly
could
be
said
in
that
same
vein
that
a
drug
enforcement
officer
could...
or
the
drug
enforcement
administration
in
new
york
state
could
petition
the
legislature
to
pass
a
similar
statute
and
call
it
administrative
and
declare
that
there's
a
great
health
problem
as
far
as
possessing
and
using
drugs
are
concerned,
and
to
search
any
premises
administratively
to
recover
evidence
of
drug
trafficking.
we
think
there
are
two
issues
in
the
case,
the
first
being
whether
the
subject
matter
of
the
statutes
is
one
to
be
granted
exemption
from
the
warrant
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
two,
whether
the
statutes
themselves
in
this
instance
are
sufficiently
tailored
to
the
state's
proper
objectives
to
adequately
minimize
the
dangers
inherent
in
the
unbridled
exercise
of
administrative
discretion.
these
statutes
have
really
no
requirements.
there's
no
strictures
at
all.
they
speak
not
of
any
target
selection.
they
don't
speak
of
the
frequency
of
the
inspection
or
the
scope
of
the
inspection,
the
duration
of
the
inspection
or
the
prohibition
against
forcible
entry.
there
is
no
standard
for
the
industry
to
guide
the
licensee.
the
statutes
contain
nothing.
and
under
your...
the
most
recent
cases
by
this
court,
in
donovan
against
dewey
and
marshall
against
barlows,
certainly
these
statutes
in
415-a
wouldn't
be
an
adequate
substitute
for
a
search
warrant.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
we
don't
believe
so.
we
would
urge
that
it
wouldn't.
we
would
urge
that
police
officers
should
never
be
administrative
inspectors,
police
officers
with
general
police
duties.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
well,
we
urge
that
that's
to
the
entire
point
of
this.
the
auto
crime
division,
that's
precisely
what
their
primary
function
is,
to
search
for
criminal
evidence
of
auto
crime,
and
we
don't
believe
that
they
could
ever
really
be
really,
truly
administrative
inspectors.
yes,
maybe
something
secondarily
might
fall
off
in
an
administrative
vein.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
as
long
as
the
prime
focus
is
not
to
gather
evidence
of
crime.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
it's
just
too
fine
a
line
to
draw,
we
would
urge,
the
difference
between
someone
who
is
basically
a
cop
and
someone
who
is
basically
an
administrator.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
well,
no.
we
are
urging
both.
we
think
that
there
should
be
at
least
an
administrative
warrant
and
it
shouldn't
be
by
police
officers
at
any
time.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
i
would
agree.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
his
immediate
purpose
as--
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
--i
think
that
the
law
is
to
regulate
and
not
to
take
the
further
step
of
actually
gathering
the
evidence
of
a
crime.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
well,
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
actually
drew
that
line.
they
said
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
merely
inspecting
the
records,
but
the
judge
friendly
case
that
is
cited,
turashiano
against
montaigne,
dealt
with
a
problem
in
that
field.
judge
friendly
emphasized
that
the
new
york
statute
authorizing
inspections
of
druggists,
narcotic
records,
had
been
amended
to
restrict
the
right
of
inspection
to
representatives
of
the
health
department
rather
than
all
peace
officers
within
the
state.
he
emphasized
that
distinction,
but
i
think
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
willing
to
let
police
officers
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
actually
inspect
the
books.
but
what
the
objection
was,
was
to
step
two
where
you
try
to
compare
the
book
with
the
products
in
the
art.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
here
there
was
nothing.
here
the
officer
conceded
that
he
had
no
administrative
purpose.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
but
the
whole
idea
of
it
was,
there
was
no
purpose
at
all.
there
was
nothing
administrative.
he
had
no
administrative
purpose
at
all.
he
didn't
even
have
a
book.
he
didn't
call
any
administrative
agency,
and
he
was
stuck
with
the
fact
that
when
cross
examined,
as
you
can
see
from
the
record,
he
was
stuck
by
the
fact
that
all
he
was
in
there
for
was
to
write
down
vin
numbers
and
to
call
them
in
to
see
if
the
parts
that
were
found
in
the
yard
were
stolen.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
yes,
i
did.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
i
did,
yes.
it
was
argued
on
a
state
constitutional
basis.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
yes,
they
did.
mr.
stephen
r.
mahler
yes.
that's
what
happened.
if
there
are
no
other
questions.
