scalia
why
don't
they
use
administrative
officers,
if
this
is
an
administrative
search?
i
mean,
isn't
that
part
of
the
problem
here,
you
are
using
just
ordinary
law
enforcement
officials
to
conduct
what
you
say
is
an
administrative
search?
justice
scalia
who
administers
this
administrative
scheme?
who
is
in
charge
of
overseeing
the
entire
operation
of
these
laws?
is
there
an
administrator?
i
mean,
is
there
somebody
with
a
title,
administrator
of
chop
shops
or
something?
justice
scalia
ms.
holtzman,
before
you
go
on,
i
am
not
sure
what
was
the
relevance
of
the
factors
you
mentioned
a
little
bit
earlier,
that
this
was
an
open
field
in
brooklyn
and
the
entrance
was
very
wide
and
the
public
came
on.
what
do
you
mean
to
establish
by
that?
do
you
assert
that
the
search
would
have
been
valid
even
without
the
justification
of
the
regulatory
scheme?
justice
scalia
well,
then
how
does
that
have
any...
how
does
that
have
bearing
to
your
case?
justice
scalia
well,
are
you
inviting
us
to
hold
that
this
is
okay,
at
least
where
what
you
are
doing
is
going
into
an
open
field
that
has
a
20-foot
entrance
and
where
the
public
come
on,
but
it
might
not
be
okay
if
it
were
walled
in,
if
it
were
an
inside
premises,
if
the
public
was
only
admitted
through
a
narrow
door
and
after
checking
their
credentials
or
whatever?
i'm
not
sure
what
you
want
us
to
do
with
these,
you
know,
specific
factors
that
you
have
brought
out.
justice
scalia
it's
not
the
whole
industry.
the
factors
you
have
mentioned
just
apply
to
this
particular
yard,
and
i
don't
know
how
that's
relevant
to
your
defensive
scheme
on
its
face,
which
is
what
i
assume
you
are
interested
in
doing
here.
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
that's
the
prime
goal
of
the
administrative
scheme?
don't
you
think
the
administrative
scheme
would
have
that
as
its
prime
goal
even
if
it
were
administered
not
by
policemen
but
by...
i
don't
know,
commissioners?
justice
scalia
why
are
they
administering
this
scheme?
is
it
a
health
factor,
they
are
worried
about
contagion
from
junkyards?
justice
scalia
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
to
prevent
people
from
chopping
up
stolen
vehicles,
isn't
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
entire--
justice
scalia
--i
must
say,
i
don't
see
the
distinction.
the
purpose
of
the
administrative
scheme
is
to
make
sure
that
anybody
who
runs
a
disassembly
operation
and
is
fencing
stolen
cars
can
be
found
out
because
you
make
them
keep
records
and
you
make
them
allow
the
things
to
be
inspected.
the
whole
purpose
of
doing
that
is
to
assure
that
if
he
has
a
stolen
car
there,
it
will
be
discovered.
isn't
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
scheme?
justice
scalia
you
assert
that
this
would
be
perfectly
okay
if
they
had
used
administrative
officers
instead
of
policemen?
justice
scalia
even
though,
as
i
think
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
uncover
evidence
of
crime?
justice
scalia
and
if
you
asked
the
administrator,
whoever
it
was,
what's
your
job,
what
do
you
think
he'd
say
his
job
was?
"my
job
is
inspecting
inventory"?
he'd
say,
"my
job
is
to
try
to
prevent
stolen
autos
from
being
chopped
up.
"
isn't
he
doing
the
same
thing
that
the
police
are...
in
other
words,
isn't
it...
although
you
purport
to
be
objecting
only
to
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
being
implemented
by
police
officers,
isn't
your
basic
objection
that
you
cannot
have...
and
it
may
well
be
a
valid
one,
but
isn't
basically
what
you
are
saying,
that
you
can't
have
a
regulatory
statute
whose
purpose
is
not
somehow
to
regulate
the
operations
of
an
industry
but
whose
whole
purpose
is
to
determine
whether
that
industry
is
violating
some
other
laws?
justice
scalia
so
you
are...
i
don't
think
you'd
be
contented
if
there
was
an
administrator
who
did
the
same
thing
that
the
policeman
did
here.
you'd
still
say
the
whole
object
of--
justice
scalia
--but
doesn't
it
have
to
be
his
immediate
purpose
under
this
law?
what
else
is
the
law
for?
it's
to
uncover
stolen
cars.
