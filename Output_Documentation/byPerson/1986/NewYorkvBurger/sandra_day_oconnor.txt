justice
o'connor
what
would
the
difficulty
be,
ms.
holtzman,
of
getting
an
administrative
warrant,
which
of
course
can
be
obtained
more
easily
than
a
warrant
in
a
criminal
case
on
probable
cause?
justice
o'connor
there
is
no
authority--
justice
o'connor
--under
new
york
state
law
to
permit
obtaining
an
administrative
warrant?
justice
o'connor
there
is
some
suggestion
in
cases
that
one
of
the
factors
we
would
look
at
would
be
whether
there
are
limits
placed
on
the
discretion
of
the
inspectors,
in
this
case
the
officers?
justice
o'connor
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
like
to
comment
on
the
extent
to
which
you
think
that
these
particular
statutes
have
such
limits.
i
guess
we
have
two
here,
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
state
law.
justice
o'connor
i
don't
think
i
saw
any
limits
at
all
on
the
city's
ordinance,
and
i
am
not
sure
there
are
very
many
in
the
state
statute.
justice
o'connor
ms.
holtzman,
are
you
familiar
with
the
laws
in
other
state
that
deal
with
this
same
problem,
generally
speaking?
justice
o'connor
some
33
states?
justice
o'connor
do
most
of
those
statutes
have
provisions
for
administrative
warrants?
justice
o'connor
that's
all
right.
thank
you.
