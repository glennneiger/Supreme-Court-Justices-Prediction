ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
here
is
whether
the
constitution
allows
states,
as
it
has
allowed
the
federal
government,
to
regulate
a
specific
industry
in
order
to
meet
a
compelling
public
need
and
to
enforce
that
regulatory
scheme
with
warrantless
inspections.
new
york
state's
effort
to
regulate
the
vehicle
dismantlers
industry
for
the
purpose
of
curbing
the
serious
problem
of
auto
theft
with
its
attendant
economic
burdens
and
physical
safety
burdens
falls
squarely
under
the
well
settled
criteria
of
biswell,
colonnade
and
donovan
versus
dewey.
the
new
york
regulatory
scheme
under
415-a
of
the
vehicle
traffic
law
is
aimed
at
vehicle
dismantlers
and
has
three
interrelated
components:
registration
and
re-registration
on
a
periodic
basis,
comprehensive
record
keeping
requirements,
and
warrantless
inspections.
the
administrative
purposes
of
the
regulatory
scheme
are
as
follows:
the
protection
of
legitimate
vehicle
dismantlers;
to
return
more
stolen
cars
to
owners,
which
is
an
important
purpose
in
and
of
itself
and
also
to
reduce
insurance
costs;
by
the
record
keeping
requirement
to
deter
would-be
auto
thieves;
to
trace
cars
back
to
the
auto
thieves;
and
to
prevent
the
vehicle
dismantling
industry
from
being
used
as
a
mechanism
for
fencing
stolen
cars.
the
statute
at
issue
here
has
been
criticized
as
being
designed
to
allow
police
officers
to
conduct
warrantless
searches
of
inventory,
and
that
the
statute
serves
no
real
administrative
purpose.
that
reasoning
is
wrong.
it
is
wrong
for
a
number
of
reasons.
it
is
wrong,
first,
because
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
establishes
clearly
that
new
york
state
first
set
up
a
regulatory
scheme
that
included
no
inspection
of
inventory.
the
inspection
of
inventory
was
added
only
six
years...
was
added
six
years
after
the
statute
went
into
effect.
and
the
purpose
of
doing
that
was
to
make
sure
that
the
other
components
of
the
regulatory
scheme
worked;
namely,
the
registration
and
the
record
keeping
components.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
well,
the
simple
answer
is
there
is
no
scheme
allowing
that
in
new
york
state,
but
beyond
that--
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
--exactly.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
exactly.
and
it's
also,
under
the
case
of
biswell,
clear
that
under
a
routine
administrative
search,
that
with
clearly
delimited
criteria
on
the
basis
of
which
a
search
can
be
conducted;
in
other
words,
in
terms
of
reasonable
time
and
the
place
and
the
scope
of
the
search,
that
administrative
warrant
is
not
necessary
under
the
prior
holdings
of
this
court.
the
complaint
about
the
inventory
inspection
is
that
it
was
not
really
done
for
administrative
purposes
because
there
were
no
records
there.
our
answer
to
this
is
that
it
is
clear
that
inspections
of
inventory
are
crucial
to
enforce
both
the
registration
requirement
and
the
record
keeping
requirement,
first
to
make
sure
that
the
records
are
accurate,
but
in
this
case
since
there
were
no
records
there,
the
purpose
of
the
administrative
examination
of
the
inventory
was
to
make
sure
that
vehicle
dismantlers
didn't
develop
this
huge
loophole.
if
vehicle
dismantlers
knew
that
they
could
not
produce
records
and
thereby
forestall
a
search,
inspection
of
inventory,
then
clearly
unscrupulous
vehicle
dismantlers
would
decide
not
to
produce
their
records
at
the
scene.
in
addition--
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
--yes.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
let
me
address
the
state
statute
first.
under
the
state
statute,
there
are
clear
limits
as
to
time.
the
only
times
at
which
the
administrative
search
can
take
place
are
during
regular
and
usual
business
hours.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
place,
the
only
place
that
the
administrative
inspection
can
take
place
is
on
the
premises;
with
respect
to
records
and
inventory
or
materials
covered
by
the
record
keeping
requirement
that
are
on
the
premises;
with
regard
to
the
scope,
only
with
respect
to
the
records
and
with
regard
to
inventory
covered
by
or
required
to
be
kept
by
the
records.
there
is
no
suggestion
whatsoever
in
the
record,
and
in
fact
it
doesn't
exist,
that
this
search
was
anything
other
than
a
normal,
routine
administrative
search
for
books
and
records
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
no.
there
is
no
maximum
limit
on
the
number
of
searches
permissible
under
the
statute.
but
to
answer
justice
o'
connor's
second
question
about
the
new
york
city
ordinance,
the
city
ordinance
has
been
construed
by
a
trial
court,
not
by
a
higher
court,
as
requiring
reasonable...
inspections
during
reasonable
business
hours.
while
that
statute
might
need
more
creative
construction
to
bring
it
into
line
with
some
of
the
court's
prior
precedents,
we
believe
that
it
could
and
would
be
so
construed
by
the
new
york
state
courts.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
why
new
york
state
used
police
officers,
but
they
do
use
department
of
motor
vehicles
officers
to
conduct
administrative
searches
under
the
statute
as
well.
but
in
the
biswell
case,
the
statute
was
the
government's
licensing
scheme
with
respect
to
gun
owners,
was
enforced
by
u.s.
treasury
agents
who
are,
in
effect,
the
equivalent
of
new
york
city
police
officers.
they
were
carrying...
they
have
the
authority
to
carry
guns
and
they
have
the
authority
to
make
arrests
of
all
federal
crimes,
just
as
a
new
york
city
police
officer
has
the
authority
to
make
arrests
within
the
limited
jurisdiction
of
crimes
under
the
new
york
city
statute.
in
addition,
under
the
prior
rulings
of
the
court,
the
reasonableness
of
the
administrative
scheme
has
to
be
weighed
against
the
expectations
of
privacy
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
and
the
expectations
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
industry
or
people
involved
in
the
industry
here.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
there
is
really
nothing
in
the
record
that
completely
explains
the
administrative
scheme,
to
respond
to
your
question,
except
to
say
that
the
scheme
is
enforced
both
by
department
of
motor
vehicles
personnel.
it
is
my
understanding
that
in
the
past,
from
time
to
time
department
of
consumer
affairs
personnel
also
enforce
the
regulatory
scheme
and
then
police
officers,
as
part
of
a
special
auto
crimes
unit,
would
engage
in
routine
inspections
under
the
administrative
statute.
and
indeed
the
routine...
the
administrative
quality
of
this
inspection
is
shown
by
the
questions
that
were
asked
when
the
police
originally
arrived.
as
the
record
shows,
the
police
had
no
hint,
suspicion,
hunch
or
anything,
or
tip
that
there
was
any
criminal
activity
going
on,
on
these
premises.
when
they
arrived
the
first
questions
that
they
asked
were,
are
you
registered
as
a
vehicle
dismantler
under
the
registration
requirement,
and
do
you
have
the
police
book,
the
records
required
to
be
kept.
then
when
they
answered
no
to
that,
they
went
ahead
and
inspected
the
inventory
which
is,
as
the
record
shows,
the
normal
procedure
whether
the
records
are
there
or
not.
with
respect
to
the
privacy
interests
involved
here,
they
are
marginal
and
negligible
at
best.
in
the
first
place
you
have,
in
this
case,
the
business
of
the
vehicle
dismantler
being
conducted
in
an
open
field,
if
you
can
imagine
an
open
field
in
brooklyn.
there
were
no
structures
on
the
field.
indeed,
there
was
no
demarcation
of
what
was
public
and
what
was
private.
this
is
typical
of
junk
yards.
indeed,
the
word
"junk
yards"
suggests
that
much
of
the
business
is
going
to
be
conducted
out
in
the
open
as
is
typical
with
regard
to
large
vehicles
which
are
dismantled,
and
the
scrap
business.
in
addition,
there
was
a
very
wide
entrance
way
to
this
vehicle
dismantler's
premises,
of
20
to
25
feet
in
width.
moreover,
people
were
admitted
to
these
premises.
the
public
came
on
to
sell
the
dealer
refrigerators,
scrap,
automobiles,
and
this
is
typical
of
the
vehicle
dismantlers
business.
vehicle
dismantlers
must
do
commerce
with
people
coming
in
for
the
purpose
of
buying
the
vehicles
to
begin
with,
and
of
selling
the
results
of
their
dismantling.
third,
what
was
the
nature
of
the
inspection
of
inventory
that
took
place?
it
was
simply
the
inspection
of
vehicle
identification
numbers
or
vins
which,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
past,
for
which
the
court
has
recognized
in
the
past,
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy.
it
was
at
most
an
extremely
unintrusive
search
of
the
inventory.
and
in
addition,
this
is
an
industry
that
has
been
pervasively
regulated,
so
the
expectations
of
a
person
entering
into
the
vehicle
dismantler
business,
with
regard
to
privacy,
are
low.
with
regard
to
junkyards,
a
lower
court
in
new
york
has
found
that
secondhand
dealers,
junkyard
dealers,
have
been
regulated
for
more
than
140
years.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
think,
however,
in
this
case
where
you
do
have
a
very
lengthy
scheme
of
regulation,
both
with
regard
to
the
secondhand...
people
who
deal
in
secondhand
goods,
with
regard
to
people
who
sell
motor
vehicles,
that
you
do
have
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy.
in
addition,
your
honor,
as
this
court
has
mentioned
in
the
past,
you
have
a
registration
requirement
under
this
administrative
scheme,
so
that
the
person
engaged
in
the
vehicle
dismantlers
business
has,
it
seems
to
me
for
these
reasons,
a
lower
expectation
of
privacy
than
someone
who
wasn't
in
this
business.
the
final--
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
--no,
no.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
the
regulatory
scheme
itself,
we
argue,
is
reasonable.
but
in
addition,
in
this
case
you
have
lower
expectations
of
privacy
in
part
because
of
the
nature
of
the
business
that
was
conducted,
and
in
part
because
of
the
premises
of
this
defendant,
and
in
part
because
of
the
regulation,
the
pervasive
regulation
of
the
industry
that
the
defendant--
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
--they
are
not
determinative,
your
honor.
they
simply
suggest...
the
determinative
factor
is
the
nature
of
the
administrative
scheme
and
the
pervasive
regulation
of
the
industry.
but
we
also
think
that
in
addition
to
that
you
have
other
factors
affecting
the
nature
of
this
industry
that
reduce
the
level
of
privacy
interest.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
perhaps
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
i
am
not
sure
that...
i
didn't
say
that
these
factors
applied
only
to
the
defendant.
i
think
it
is
typical
of
the
vehicle
dismantlers
industry
in
general
that
much
of
the
activity
is
conducted
in
the
open,
that
in
addition
to
that
there
is
commerce
back
and
forth
of
people
who
come
to
do
business.
the
final
reason
that
we
would
urge
that
the
defendant's
interest
in
privacy
is
low
is
because
of
the...
is
because
he
cannot
create
an
expectation
of
privacy
by
committing
an
illegal
act.
a
legitimate
vehicle
dismantler,
under
new
york
state,
who
is
obeying
the
regulatory
scheme
would
have
had
books
and
records
there
and
therefore
the
inventory
could
have
been
inspected
both
for
the
purpose
of
checking
against
the
books
and
records
to
determine
the
books
and
records
were
accurate,
and
for
the
other
administrative
purposes
i
have
mentioned.
this
vehicle
dismantler
would
have
this
court
believe
that
by
violating
the
law,
by
removing
his
books
and
records
or
by
never
keeping
them
in
the
first
place,
he
can
create
a
new
special
privacy
interest
in
an
inventory
that
a
law-abiding
vehicle
dismantler
would
not
have.
and
i
think
that
position
is
untenable,
as
this
court
has
held
in
class,
new
york
versus
class,
the
artificial
creation...
the
creation
of
an
artificial
encumbrance
doesn't
undo
lack
of
privacy
that
existed
in
the
inventory
to
begin
with.
so,
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
that
this--
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
--that's
true.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
but
the
statutory
scheme
creates
a
low
level
of
expectation
of
privacy
because
vehicle
dismantlers
are
required
to
keep
books
and
records.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
and
can
expect
that
there
will
be
an
inspection,
not
only
of
the
books
and
records
but
of
the
inventory
to
match
against
the
books
and
records.
this
vehicle
dismantler
says,
i
have
a
higher
expectation
of
privacy
in
my
inventory
because
i
am
not
keeping
books
and
records.
i
am
violating
the
law
and
that
gives
me
a
higher
interest
of
privacy
in
this
inventory.
and
i
submit,
respectfully,
that
that
argument
is
absurd.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
well,
you
could
make
the
argument,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
but
that
doesn't
mean--
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
--that's
not
a
frivolous
argument
but
it
wouldn't
depend,
therefore,
on
the
privacy
interest
in
an
inventory
created
by
not
keeping
records.
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
reason
this
statute
was
not
a
legitimate
administrative
statute
and
had
no
legitimate
administrative
purposes
was
because
there
could
be
an
inspection
of
an
inventory
in
the
absence
of
records.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
mr.
chief
justice,
i'll
just
take
one
or
two
minutes
simply
to
point
out
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
purpose
of
the
administrative
scheme
is
not
to
uncover
evidence
of
crime
in
a
particular
case.
the
purpose
of
the
scheme
is
to,
in
the
end,
deter
auto
theft,
to
make
sure
that
the
vehicle
dismantlers
industry
is
not
a
tool
for
fencing,
to
trace
cars,
and
to
return
stolen
cars.
there
is
no
purpose
in
the
administrative
scheme
to
uncover
evidence
of
crime
in
a
particular
case.
indeed,
the
administrative
scheme
in
biswell,
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
it's
hard
to
envision
an
administrative
scheme
that's
not
enforced
in
some
way
with
criminal
penalties.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
administrative
search
here
involved
no
home
and
involved
the
inspection
of
the
kind
that
i
noted
before.
under
the
prior
precedents
of
the
court,
i
believe
the
administrative
scheme
is
wholly
reasonable
in
terms
of
the
state
of
new
york's
desire
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
auto
theft,
to
trace
problems
of
stolen
cars,
and
we
urge
that
the
statute--
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
there
are--
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
--yes,
33
states.
it
may
be
more.
i
can't
tell
you
that
our
search--
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
but
we
could
provide
it
for
you.
ms.
elizabeth
holtzman
thank
you.
