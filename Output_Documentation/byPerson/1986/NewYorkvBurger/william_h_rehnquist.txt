chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
afternoon
in
number
86-80,
new
york
against
joseph
burger.
ms.
holtzman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
length
of
time
makes
a
difference,
ms.
holtzman?
i
mean,
does
it
have
to
have
gone
on
for
a
given
period
of
time
before
the
service
scheme
will
be
upheld?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
holtzman.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
mahler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
think
in
colonnade
and
biswell,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
law
enforcement
officers
was
to
discover
some
evidence
of
crime?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
does
the
word
"immediate",
modifying
the
word
"purpose",
add
to
the
word
"purpose"?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
justice
scalia's
question
was
addressed
to
the
purpose
of
the
administrative
scheme,
not
whether
it
required
a
warrant
or
not.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
what
difference
does
that
make?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
an
administrative
statute?
i
mean,
i
think
you're
just
using
a
lot
of
terms
that
may
not
have
a
great
deal
of
meaning.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
these
people
walk
in...
when
the
inspectors
walk
into
the
yard
here
and
they
say,
do
you
have
your
police
book,
the
guy
answers
no.
now,
that's
evidence
of
crime
right
there,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
any
time
you
have
an
administrative
statute
or,
as
you
call
it,
an
administrative
scheme,
the
requirement
requires
the
keeping
of
records
and
someone
is
going
to
come
around
to
see
if
you
have
records
and
they
ask
you
the
question,
do
you
have
any
records,
you
answer
no.
there
is
evidence
of
crime
right
there.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
other
words,
if
a
man
complies
with
the
law
and
keeps
records,
they
can
be
inspected
but
if
he
doesn't
keep
records
the
police
are
stopped
stone
cold?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
they
could
perhaps
get
a
search
warrant.
i
guess
the
question
here
is,
does
the
constitution
require
them
to.
well,
in
biswell
it
was
a
treasury
agent,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
mahler,
for
many
years,
i
don't
know
if
they're
still
doing
it
but
i
think
it
was
the
harrison
act,
required
all
pharmacies
to
keep
a
poison
register
where
you
had
to
sign
if
you
took
out
any
of
a
number
of
scheduled
substances,
and
i
daresay
there
were
inspections
provided
to
see
if
the
poison
registers
were
kept.
now,
would
that
fall
afoul
of
these
strictures
that
you
find
in
the
constitution?
i
mean,
i'm
sure
the
poison
register
was
just
to
see
whether
the
pharmacists
were
complying
with
the
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
here
there
were
no
books
to
compare.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
i
don't
know
who
conceded
what.
you
could
say
equally
well
the
defendant
conceded
he
didn't
have
any
books.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mahler.
ms.
holtzman,
you
have
12
minutes
left
should
you
choose
to
use
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
holtzman.
the
case
is
submitted.
