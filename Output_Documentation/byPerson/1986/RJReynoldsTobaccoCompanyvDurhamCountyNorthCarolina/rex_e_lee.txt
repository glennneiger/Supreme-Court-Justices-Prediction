mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
basic
question
in
this
preemption
case
is
whether
the
petitioner
has
met
its
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
congress
really
intended
to
take
away
the
power
of
state
and
local
governments
to
impose
a
non-discriminatory
property
tax
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
case
simply
is
not
xerox.
the
holding
doesn't
apply
and
the
rationale
squarely
supports
the
holding
of
the
north
carolina
courts.
there
is
one
factual
feature
of
the
case
that
distinguishes
xerox
and
controls
its
outcome.
the
xerox
corporation
had
an
option
in
between
the
time
that
those
machines
were
manufactured
in
mexico
and
sold
in
some
country
other
than
the
united
states,
spanish-speaking
or
portuguese-speaking,
to
warehouse
those
machines
either
in
an
american
warehouse
or
some
warehouse
other
than
in
the
united
states.
in
the
event
that
it
elected
to
warehouse
here,
then
some
american
port
will
get
the
business.
in
this
case
there
is
no
corresponding
option
available
to
reynolds.
these
goods,
unlike
the
goods
in
xerox,
as
mr.
griswold
has
pointed
out,
are
not
for
sale.
they
are
for
manufacture.
the
only
reason
that
reynolds
buys
tobacco
is
to
make
it
into
cigarettes,
and
the
only
place
in
the
world
that
it
manufactures
cigarettes
is
in
winston-salem,
north
carolina,
and
as
a
consequence
that
means
that
its
foreign
leaf
tobacco
must
come
in
through
an
american
port.
there
is
no
other
option.
it
will
come
in
through
an
american
port.
and
the
only
competition
affected
by
this
case
is
not
american
ports
versus
foreign
ports,
it
is
american
tobacco
growers
versus
foreign
tobacco
growers.
reynolds
does
not
challenge
and
could
not
challenge
the
finding,
and
i
am
quoting
it,
that
"none
of
the
imported
tobacco
in
bonded
storage
was
being
held
for
export
by
reynolds.
"
and
in
fact
none
of
it
ever
has.
in
light
of
that
unequivocal
finding,
the
issue
comes
down
to
this.
can
congress
be
assumed
to
have
intended
to
exempt
more
than
a
half
billion
dollars
worth
of
foreign
tobacco
that
has
come
permanently
to
rest
in
this
country
from
the
same
property
tax
that
american
grown
tobacco
must
pay
when
the
two
impose
identical
demands
on
county
and
city
resources
and
are
used
for
identical
purposes,
namely,
they
are
the
manufacturing
inventory
for
the
owner's
american
plant.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
there
is
that
notion...
excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
let
me
answer
it.
the
xerox
opinion,
first
of
all,
let
me
say,
there
is
the
one,
there
is
the
sentence
at
the
end,
but
the
sentence
at
the
beginning
says,
"we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
a
state
may
impose
non-discriminatory
ad
valorem
and
personal
property
taxes
on
imported
goods
stored
under
bond
in
a
customs
warehouse
and
destined
for
foreign
markets.
"
now,
the
petitioner,
to
be
sure,
does
have
this
argument
that
up
until
the
time
that
the
goods
are
actually
taken
out
of
customs
bond,
that
they
are
not
within
the
jurisdiction
and
therefore
not
within
the
power,
and
there
is
the
dictum
that
is
relied
on
from
the
district
of
columbia
case
and
also
from
an
older
case
from
bree
versus
murphy
of
some
time
ago.
neither
of
those...
two
points.
one
is
that
neither
of
those
cases
involved
the
problem
that
is
involved
here,
but
bree
versus
murphy
did
not
even
involve
state
taxes
at
all.
it
involved
only
the
customs,
only
the
customs
duty
itself.
it
would
make,
justice
o'connor,
the
state's
constitutional
rights
to
exercise
their
most
important
governmental
function,
the
power
to
tax,
which
is
the
power
on
which
all
other
governmental
powers
depend,
turn
on
a
wooden
formalism,
and
that
is,
it
would
turn
on
which
side
of
a
yellow
line
in
a
class
ii
customs
bonded
warehouse
those
goods
happened
to
be
on,
and
i
simply
submit
that
it
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--let
me
address
that
question,
and
i
will
do
so
in
two
steps.
the
first
is
to
observe
that...
three
steps.
the
first
is
to
observe
that,
as
you
correctly
state,
that
is
not
this
case,
and
therefore
does
not
have
to
be
decided
in
this
case.
all
that
you
have
to
decide
in
this
case
is
that
where
there
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
next
step
down
the
road.
but
so
long
as
we
are...
we
recognize,
first
of
all,
that
we
are
really
deciding
the
next
case
and
not
this
one.
my
second
point
is
that
i
don't
think
it
is
terribly...
it
is
not
either
necessary
nor
even
helpful
to
speculate
on
what
that
circumstance
would
be
because
history
teaches
that
in
the
context
of
this
particular
warehousing
act
that
by
the
time
the
case
has
reached
this
court
that
question
will
have
been
decided.
in
xerox,
for
example,
it
was
very
clear
by
the
time...
on
the
record
by
the
time
the
case
got
here
that
all
of
those
machines
were
destined
for
transshipment.
in
mcgoldrick
it
was
very
clear
on
the
record
that
all
of
that
fuel
was
to
be
used
on
vessels
in
foreign
commerce.
and
in
this
case
it
is
undisputed
that
all
of
these
goods
are
going
to
be
manufactured
into
tobacco.
it
would
seem
that
whatever
the
circumstance
might
have
been
in
1846,
when
there
might
be
this
uncertainty,
that
with
the
improved
telecommunications
of
today's
modern
world,
that
that
will
not
be
a
serious
problem,
and
as
a
consequence
i
would
say
that
the
only
thing
you
really
have
to
decide
is
today's
case
and
that
you
don't
have
to
anticipate
that.
now,
the
final
and
my
third
point
is
that
in
the
event
that
you
do,
as
i
would
urge
you
not
to,
i
think
the
fair
way
to
handle
it
if
the
exporter,
if
the
taxpayer
doesn't
know
whether
he
is
going
to
ship
it
or
not,
pay
the
tax,
and
then
in
the
event
that
he
does
transship
it,
the
laws
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
give
him
a
remedy
to
sue
in
the
event
that
he...
that
that
should
eventually
be
the
holding,
that
he
is
entitled
to
it,
to
get
the
tax
back.
and
this
brings
me
back
to
the
standard
by
which
to
determine
what
was
congress's
real
intent
here.
did
congress
really
intend
to
take
away
the
power
to
tax
under
these
circumstances?
and
a
helpful
starting
point
is
a
brief
review
of
the
threshold
of
proof
that
must
be
made
in
order
to
establish
that
proposition.
congressional
intent
to
preempt
state
law
will
never
be
lightly
inferred,
as
this
court
has
made
very
clear,
particularly
in
the
last
three
or
four
years,
and
that
is
especially
true,
we
submit,
when
the
power
to
tax
is
involved.
the
power
to
tax
is
not
only
a
core
governmental
function,
it
is
the
function
on
which
all
others
depend,
and
because
under
garcia
congress
is
the
principal
protector
of
the
state's
constitutional
rights
of
self-governance,
we
submit
that
it
follows
that
congress
should
not
be
assumed
to
have
taken
that
responsibility
lightly,
and
that
congress
should
be
assumed
to
have
intruded
into
the
state's
taxing
power
only
if
congress
itself
makes
that
intent
very
clear,
and
this
case
simply
doesn't
arise
to
that
standard.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
might
be
deferred.
i
think
that
is
the
most.
i
think
that
is
the
most
that
can
be
inferred,
and
of
course
that
is
a
result
that
would
not
be
totally
unwelcome
to
us.
it
would
not
be
our
preferred
result,
but
at
least
there
would
be...
i
think
it
is
easier
to
read
that
kind
of
result
into
a
federal
duties
deferral
scheme
than
it
is
to
read
an
exemption
result
into
a
federal
duties
deferral
scheme.
but
i
would
point
out
that
reynolds
can
point
to
no
language,
no
congressional
language
either
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
that
even
mentions
exemption
from
state
taxes.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
note
in
that
respect
the
rule
for
which
reynolds
is
asking
and
the
rule--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
but
then
i
am
sure
that
you
already--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--understand
what
the
distinction
is
between
this
case
and
xerox,
and
here
is
where
you
can't
distinguish
this
case
from
xerox.
reynolds
attempts
to
take
xerox
and
say
that
from
that
it
is
not
just
a
case
that
is
applicable
where
the
goods,
where
the
presence
of
the
goods
in
this
country
is
simply
in
a
way
station,
in
a
foreign
journey
that
neither
began
here
nor
will
end
here
but
is
a
per
se
rule
that
any
time
the
goods
get
into
a
customs
bonded
warehouse,
that
ipso
facto,
per
se,
makes
them
exempt
from
all
state
taxes.
and
my
point,
justice
scalia,
is
that
while
you
may
have
been
able...
no,
excuse
me,
while
you
can
properly
infer
an
intent
from
the
general
congressional
purpose
or
you
do
have
the
clean
facts
of
a
completely
international
journey,
it
is
an
entirely
different
matter
under
facts
such
as
these.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
my
answer
to
that
is
that
that
is
better
a
question
to
be
addressed
to
congress
because
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
how
much
mileage
can
you
get
out
of
what
congress
said
and
what
was
their
purpose
in
passing
the
warehousing
act.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
two
points.
the
first
is
that
that
is
an
argument
that
would
support
justice
o'connor's
point
of
view,
that
you
defer
the
state
tax
until
such
time
as
the
federal
tax
is
imposed,
but
let
me
tell
you
why
that...
they
really
weren't
talking
about
that
kind
of
ribbon
matching
between
federal
customs
duties
on
the
one
hand
and
tax
exemption
on
the
other.
it
will
take
me
just
about
30
seconds
to
give
you
that
answer.
the
first
is,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this,
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says.
it
says
nothing,
neither
the
language
nor
the
legislative
history
says
one
word
about
exemption
from
state
taxes.
now,
in
addition,
there
is
a
regulation,
and
this
goes
directly
to
your
point,
justice
scalia,
there
is
a
regulation
that
is
cited
at
footnote
24
of
our
brief,
and
i
quote
it.
it
requires
the
private
bonded
warehouse
owner,
this
is
the
warehouse
owner,
and
i
am
quoting
now,
"to
provide
an
estimate
of
the
maximum
duties
and
taxes.
"
duties
and
taxes,
footnote
24,
"which
will
be
due
on
all
merchandise
in
the
bonded
warehouse.
"
now,
the
significance
of
that
regulation
is
this.
the
rule
for
which
reynolds
is
contending
is
a
per
se
xx
that
once
it
is
in
the
warehouse
it
is
exempt
from
taxing.
there
is
no
way
you
can
square
that
with
a
regulation
that
refers
to
taxes
which
will
be
due,
and
that
was
not
the
customs
duties
they
were
talking
about
because
it
refers
to
duties
and
taxes.
that
leaves
you
with
the
only
argument
that
reynolds
has,
one
which
i
would
like
to
concentrate
on
now,
that
a
blanket
exemption
can
nevertheless
be
inferred
from
the
more
general
purposes
of
the
statute,
and
it
is
true
that
the
two
primary
purposes
of
the
federal
tariff
laws
as
developed
by
our
brief
are,
first,
to
gather
revenue,
and
second,
to
protect
american
businesses.
and
in
xerox
the
court
inferred
an
intent
to
exempt
where
the
goods
were
destined
for
foreign
transshipment,
and
it
is
very
clear
and,
i
think,
very
proper
that
the
reason
is
because
of
the
favorable
competitive
effect
on
american
ports,
and
as
i
believe
it
was
you
pointed
out,
justice
scalia,
that
distinction
between...
good,
yes,
it
was
you...
that
are
to
be
transshipped
and
that
are
not
to
be
transshipped
is
recognized
in
the
warehousing
act,
which
imposes
no
customs
duty
on
imported
goods
destined
for
foreign
markets.
now,
if
you
take
that
xerox
rationale
and
apply
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
you
will
affirm,
because
the
only
american
industries
whose
competitive
standing
is
at
stake
in
this
case
are
the
american
tobacco
producers.
and
like...
in
xerox,
reynolds
does
not
need
any
federal
incentive
to
bring
its
foreign
grown
leaf
tobacco
into
this
country
for
manufacture
here
rather
than
manufacturing
some
place
else.
the
only
place
it
can
manufacture
is
in
winston-salem,
and
it
did
so
long
before
it
challenged
this
case.
in
the
most
elementary
sense,
in
the
most
elementary
sense,
the
result
for
which
reynolds
is
contending
here
is
a
subsidy.
the
court
in
american
smelting
called
it
a
bounty.
enacted
into
law
by
an
american
congress
available
only
to
foreign
businesses
and
working
to
the
competitive
disadvantage
of
american
businesses,
reynolds
manufactures
from
a
blend,
a
certain
percentage
of
foreign
and
a
certain
percentage
of
domestic.
if
my
clients
lose
this
case
the
comparative
costs
of
the
two
components
of
that
blend
are
going
to
change,
and
it
will
be
to
reynolds'
economic
advantage
to
increase
the
percentage
of
foreign
tax-exempt
tobacco,
and
i
return
to
the
question,
why
would
congress
want
to
do
that?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
this
particular...
this
is
for
1983,
and
for
the
two
counties
and
three
cities,
it
is
on
the
order
of
$7
to
$8
million.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
seven
to
eight
million
dollars.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
for
the
one
year.
we
realistically
have
about
seven
years
that
are
at
stake
because
of
the
other
suits
that
are
backed
up
and
waiting
in
the
north
carolina
courts.
in
xerox,
then,
inferring
congressional
intent
to
exempt
where
the
warehouse
storage
was
really
only
a
way
station
on
a
foreign
journey,
so
that
the
only
competition
possibly
affected
involved
not
american
producers
but
american
ports
made
some
sense,
here
it
made
no
sense
at
all.
this
is
a
non-discriminatory
tax.
it
is
not
a
new
tax.
it
has
been
in
existence
at
least
since
michelin
versus
wages
as
applicable
to
this
particular
transaction.
all
that
these
counties
and
cities
are
attempting
to
do
is
to
continue
to
apply
to
tobacco
that
is
grown
in
bulgaria,
syria,
lebanon,
turkey,
and
a
few
other
places
the
same
tax
that
must
be
paid
and
will
be
paid
on
account
of
tobacco
grown
in
north
carolina,
virginia,
kentucky,
maryland,
tennessee,
and
a
few
other
states.
the
foreign
tobacco
constitutes,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
40
percent...
excuse
me,
42
percent
of
reynolds'
total
taxable
property,
at
least
in
forsyth
county,
and
the
record
is
silent
as
to
what
it
is
in
durham.
both
the
foreign
and
the
domestic
are
stored
in
identical
warehouses.
there
is
no
physical
difference
between
them.
in
both
cases
the
warehouses
are
in
fact
owned
by
reynolds
and
used
exclusively
by
them,
and
both
kinds
of
tobacco
pose
identical
demands
on
these
counties
and
cities
for
fire
and
police
protection
as
well
as
for
a
broad
range
of
services
for
reynolds
employees
who
work
with
tobacco.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
two
points.
the
first
is
that
it
is
not
our
burden
to
get
that
statute
through.
under
this
court's
well
established
precedence,
the
tilt
is
toward
the
taxing
power
and
not
against
it.
now,
the
second
point
is
the
more
telling
one.
let's
just
put
it
directly.
let's
just
face
the
question
directly,
and
let's
say
then
that
reynolds
did
go
to
congress
and
performed
its
obligation
that
it
has
to
get
the
statute
through,
and
it
proposed
a
bill
that
would
exempt
tobacco
grown
in
bulgaria
and
syria
from
property
taxes
that
have
to
be
paid
by
tobacco
grown
in
maryland
and
virginia.
now,
your
first
reaction
to
that
is
that
is
going
to
quickly
find
some
legislative
black
hole
from
which
it
will
never
emerge.
is
there
any
reason
to
assume
that
any
congress
from
1846
to
the
present
would
have
taken
any
different
position,
and
that
is
what
shows
the
mischief
that
would
be
worked
by
a
per
se
rule
in
a
case
like
this.
in
reynolds...
excuse
me,
in
xerox,
drawing
the
inference
at
least
had
some
basis,
and
here
it
does
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
barely
enough--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--we
think
xerox
represents,
justice
white,
the
outer
limits
of
what
should
be
good
law.
0
[generallaughter.]
we
certainly
do
not
have
to
ask
that
it
be
overruled
here.
and
i
think
that
most
of
what
i
said--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
and
eight
justices
who
are...
very
good
judgment,
and
we
are
not
asking...
we
are
not
asking
that
the
case
be
overruled
because
there
is
this
factual
distinction,
and
it
doesn't
do
a
lot
of
good
to
parse
the
xerox
opinion
as
though
it
were
a
statute,
and
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
do
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
was
in
effect
a
statutory
construction
question.
that's
exactly
right.
let
me
say
just
a
word
about
the
foreign
trade
zones
act.
to
the
extent
that
that
is
relevant
at
all
it
supports
our
position.
foreign
trade
zones
are
very
different
from
warehouses.
it
is
a
separate
part
of
the
statute.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
shows
anything
at
all,
that
legislative
history
simply
shows
that
congress
has
treated
one
statute
different
from
another
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
the
activity
is
different.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
several
ways.
the
most
important
way,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
they
are
in
effect...
not
in
effect,
the
statute
says
they
are
public
utilities.
and
that
means
that
any
secrets
that
reynolds
has
in
connection
with
the
blend
and
its
manufacturing
process
would
have
to
be
sacrificed.
they
are
open
to
the
public,
to
all
comers,
whereas
the
bonded
warehouses,
these
two
kinds
that
are
used
here,
are
private,
and
there
is
a
great
variety
of
activities
that
goes
on
within
these
foreign
trade
zones.
most
important
for
our
purposes,
they
are
subject
to
two
different
kinds
of
statutes,
and
they
are
subject
to
different
statutory
provisions.
they
are
not
identical.
as
my
colleague,
mr.
griswold,
has
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
foreign
trade
zones,
domestic
goods
that
come
in
for
foreign
transshipment
are
exempt
from
property
taxes,
and
congress
has
not
done
that
with
respect
to
the
warehousing
act.
now,
the
statements
by
senator
tower
and
congressman
wright,
the
most
that
you
can
get
out
of
those
is
that
they
may
have
read,
may
have
read
the
xerox
decision
the
same
as
mr.
griswold
does.
i
don't
think
they
were
even
focusing
on
the
problem
in
this
case
at
all.
i
think
the
most
that
the
legislative
history
shows
is
what
senator
bentsen
says,
that,
and
i
am
quoting,
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
narrow
problem
dealing
with
foreign
trade
zones
in
the
state
of
texas.
they
were
simply
concentrated...
it
was
easier
to
get
a
congressional
statute
passed
than
it
was
to
amend
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
texas.
but
even
if
you
read
those
statements
as
favorably
as
possible
to
reynolds,
they
cannot
possibly
qualify
as
any
kind
of
legislative
history
of
the
warehousing
act.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
at
least
would
support
that
notion,
and
that
was
repealed.
we
think
the
repealer
supports
us,
but
i
hadn't
planned
to
mention
it
because
in
xerox
the
court
said,
we
won't
speculate
on
it.
since
the
court
has
given
that
advice,
i
will
follow
it.
but
there
is
the
remaining
regulation,
and
this
one,
i
think,
is
a
powerful
one.
the
remaining
regulation
says
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
private
bonded
warehouse
owner
to
provide
a
list
of
all
duties
and
taxes
that
will
be
due.
that
is
on,
as
i
say,
footnote
24
of
our
brief.
there
is
no
way
you
can
reconcile
that
with
the
position
that
reynolds
is
taking
in
this
case.
two
final
points.
one
is
that
there
is
only
one
case
in
which
this
court
has
squarely
decided
this
issue
on
the
merits,
and
that
is
the
summary
dismissal
of
the
appeal
in
american
smelting.
that
is
the
only
case
that
involved
the
precise
facts
of
this
case,
namely,
where
you
had
raw
materials,
manufacturing
inventory
in
a
bonded
warehouse
awaiting
manufacture
in
this
country.
and
while
we
recognize
that
a
summary
disposition
does
not
carry
as
much
precedential
weight
as
does
a
decision
following
full
briefing
and
argument,
it
does
carry
precedential
weight,
and
this
fact
remains,
and
this
is
very
clear.
if
you
look
at
holdings,
affirmance
of
the
north
carolina
courts
will
not
require
overruling
any
merits
decision
of
this
court.
reversal
will.
now,
finally,
let
me
say
just
a
word
about
the
constitutional
arguments.
we
think
that
they
follow
a
fortiori
from
the
statutory
interpretation
issue,
particularly
in
light
of
this
court's
decisions
in
michelin
versus
wages
and
wisconsin
versus
j.c.
penney,
and
that
the
overarching
principle
that
governs
both
of
those
is
the
principle
well
embedded
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
foreign
commerce
must
pay
its
fair
share.
the
court
said
in
wisconsin
versus
j.c.
penney
that
the
simple
but
controlling
question
is
whether
the
state
has
given
anything
for
which
it
can
ask
in
turn.
it
is
that
simple
but
controlling
question,
we
submit,
which
governs
this
case.
these
two
counties
and
these
three
cities
have
given
something,
the
full
range
of
governmental
services
from
fire
to
police
to
education
to
streets
and
parks
directly
attributable
to
the
presence
of
reynolds
tobacco
in
these
warehouses
in
this
country.
all
that
they
ask
in
return
is
that
the
foreign
tobacco
pay
its
fair
share,
the
same
as
the
share
that
is
paid
by
tobacco
grown
in
north
carolina
and
other
neighboring
states.
unless
the
court
has
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
further.
