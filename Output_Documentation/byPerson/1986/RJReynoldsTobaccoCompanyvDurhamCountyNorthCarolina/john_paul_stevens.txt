justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
mr.
griswold,
in
the
xerox
case
the
jurisdictional
argument
was
that
the
decision
rested
on
an
adequate
state
ground.
it
wasn't
the
claim
that
there
was
no
statute
drawn
in
question.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
immediately
preceding
sentence
was,
"appellees
argue
that
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
since
the
decision
of
the
texas
court
reversing
the
grant
of
an
injunction
rested
on
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground.
"
and
then
what
follows
is
in
response
to
that
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
their
argument
is
that
there
is
no
challenge
to
a
statute
within
the
meaning
of
the
code.
well,
perhaps
i
should--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
that
the
same
kind
of
discrimination
that
mr.
lee
is
telling
us
about
in
this
case?
potential
discrimination?
