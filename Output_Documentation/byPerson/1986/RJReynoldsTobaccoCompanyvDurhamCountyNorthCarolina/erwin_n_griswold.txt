mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
north
carolina
may
consistently
with
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
due
process
and
import-export
clauses
of
the
constitution
impose
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
on
tobacco
stored
in
a
united
states
customs
bonded
warehouse.
the
appellant
is
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
finished
tobacco
products
which,
quoting
from
the
opinion
of
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals,
it
sells
to
wholesale
distributors
and
other
authorized
purchasers
in
the
united
states
and
abroad.
in
its
manufacturing
process
reynolds
uses
both
foreign
and
domestic
tobacco.
the
foreign
tobacco
in
this
case
is
placed
under
customs
bond
when
it
enters
the
country.
it
is
then
shipped
by
customs
bonded
carriers
and
is
placed
in
customs
bonded
warehouses
in
durham
or
forsyth
counties,
north
carolina.
under
the
applicable
federal
statutes
reynolds
does
not
pay
the
customs
duties
until
the
tobacco
is
withdrawn
from
the
warehouses.
in
listing
its
personal
property
for
1983,
reynolds
claimed
that
the
imported
tobacco
in
the
customs
bonded
warehouses
was
immune
from
state
taxation
on
federal
constitutional
grounds,
relying
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
xerox
case
in
459
u.s.,
decided
less
than
four
years
ago
in
1982.
the
claims
for
immunity
were
denied
by
the
administrative
officers,
and
an
appeal
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
on
constitutional
grounds
was
unsuccessful.
reynolds
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
that
appeal
was
dismissed
without
opinion
for
lack
of
a
substantial
constitutional
question.
this
court
postponed
the
jurisdictional
question
to
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
so
i
will
address
that
first.
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
jurisdictional
question.
one
is
whether
the
appeal
should
be
taken
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
or
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
out
of
abundance
of
caution
we
filed
two
jurisdictional
statements
representing
appeals
to
both
of
the
courts.
we
don't
care
which
one
is
sustained,
but
we
have
examined
the
north
carolina
statute
in
our
brief
and
suggest
that
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
dismissing
the
appeal
there
for
want
of
a
substantial
constitutional
question
was
on
the
merits,
so
that
the
appeal
to
that
court
is
well
taken.
this
is
a
bootless
kind
of
question
which
ought
to
be
resolved
one
way
or
another,
and
it
would
be
helpful
to
practitioners
and
would
save
the
time
of
the
court
in
later
cases
if
the
question
could
be
cleared
up
in
this
decision.
the
appellants,
however,
raise
another
constitutional
question
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
another
jurisdictional
question.
this
is
a
question
which
was
not
presented
in
the
motion
to
dismiss.
they
say
that
the
validity
of
no
state
statute
was
drawn
into
question
in
the
courts
below.
we
think
that
they
are
wrong
in
that,
and
we
have
answered
them
in
our
reply
brief.
i
would
only
point
out
that
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
referred
specifically
to
a
north
carolina
statute,
the
machinery
act.
this
appears
in
the
opinion
on
page
17a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix,
and
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
then
concluded
that
the
tax
imposed
by
that
statute
is,
and
i
quote,
u.s.
constitution>
["],
and
that
appears
on
page
18a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
this
brings
the
situation
squarely
within
the
decision
of
the
court
finding
jurisdiction
in
the
japan
lines
case
in
441
us
and
in
a
case
which
i
have
already
referred
to,
the
xerox
case,
which
is
virtually
identical
to
this
one.
in
xerox
this
court
said
an
indispensable
predicate
to
an
award
of
judgment
to
the
appellees
on
their
counterclaim
was
a
determination
that
the
taxes
at
issue
were
permissible
under
the
united
states
constitution.
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
so
held.
we
therefore
have
jurisdiction
to
review
that
judgment,
and
that
would
seem
to
be
dispositive
of
the
jurisdictional
question
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
could
grant
certiorari
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
three
or
four
of
the
cases
which
have
been
cited
by
the
appellees
in
their
briefs,
in
their
brief
where
the
court
found
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
all
of
them
certiorari
was
granted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
do
not
so
understand.
the
decision
there
was
that
the
texas
statute
was
unconstitutional,
and
that's
what
the
court
said
in
that
passage,
"an
indispensable
predicate
was
that
the
taxes
at
issue
were
permissible
under
the
united
states
constitution.
"
and
that
is
not
a--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--and
the
court
held
this
court
did
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
here
there
was
a
challenge
to
the
statute
expressly
recognized
by
the
only
court
which
rendered
an
opinion
in
north
carolina,
and
that
court
held
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
the
basic
question
in
this
case
turns
in
large
part
on
what
this
court
held
in
the
xerox
case.
reynolds
submits
that
the
holding
there
was
carefully
expressed
in
the
explicit
statement
on
page
154
of
the
opinion
where
the
court
said,
"accordingly
we
hold
that
state
property
taxes
on
goods
stored
under
bond
in
a
customs
bonded
warehouse
are
preempted
by
congress's
comprehensive
regulation
of
customs
duties.
"
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
this
gets
back
almost
to
law
school
analysis
of
what
is
the
ratio
decidendi
of
the
case.
i
think
the
holding
in
that
case
was
that
there
was
preemption,
and
there
was
preemption
because
of
congress's
comprehensive
regulation
of
customs
duties,
and
that
comprehensive
regulation
of
customs
duties
applies
to
all
property
in
the
customs
bonded
warehouse
regardless
of
its
eventual
destination.
it
is
subject
to
customs
custody,
it
is
subject
to
bond,
and
the
duties
are
not
payable
until
it
is
released
from
customs
custody,
and
that
is
equally
applicable
to
all
kinds
of
property.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
justice
o'connor--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--i
think
that
would
put
the
state
very
close
to
a
violation
of
the
import-export
clause.
that
state
tax
would
not
be
due
until
the
property
was
imported.
at
that
point
the
state
tax
would
be
levied,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
hard
to
distinguish.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
one
problem
is
that
in
a
great
many
situations
you
don't
know
what
property
is
going
to
be
imported
and
what
property
is
going
to
be
exported.
you
would
have
to
estimate
or
guesstimate.
if
that
decision
is
only
made
when
the
property
is
actually
released
from
customs
and
used
domestically,
then
it
seems
to
me
to
be
very
close
to
if
not
identical
to
a
tax
on
imports.
moreover,
there
would
be
tied
up
with
this
state
tax,
i
suppose,
a
lien
for
the
state
taxes,
and
a
lien
for
state
taxes
on
property
held
in
a
customs
bonded
warehouse
certainly
involves
not
necessarily
conflicts
but
a
little
bit
like
the
church-state
situation,
intermingling
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
governments.
we
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
administer,
but
beyond
that
the
basis
for
the
decision
in
xerox,
first,
the
supremacy
clause,
second,
the
legislative
history,
which
was
reviewed
by
the
court,
and
which
i
will
endeavor
to
show
in
a
moment,
was
fairly
clear
that
this,
the
customs-bonded
warehouse
was
designed
to
facilitate
both
transshipment
and
importation,
and
finally
the
fact
that
congress
has,
we
say,
ratified
this
court's
decision
in
the
xerox
case
together
with
the
fact
that
there
are
other
passages
in
the
xerox
opinion
which
make
it
plain
that
the
court
was
aware
of
this
distinction
between
importation
and
eventual
exportation
and
specifically
clearly
decided
that
that
was
not
relevant.
that
was
brought
out
expressly
in
the
oral
argument
of
the
xerox
case.
the
transcript
appears
in
appendix
g
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
a
member
of
the
court
addressed
the
question
to
counsel
for
the
taxing
authorities,
"so
it
really
does
not
make
any
difference
in
this
case
as
to
whether
they
are
destined
for
a
foreign
market.
"
to
which
counsel
replied,
"absolutely
not",
and
then
when
counsel
for
xerox
was
at
this
podium
the
following
question
was
asked,
"well,
is
an
importer
who
says,
yes,
these
are
going
to
be
sold
in
the
united
states,
and
he
puts
them
in
a
bonded
warehouse
and
holds
them
for
two
years,
may
texas
levy
a
tax
while
they
are
in
the
warehouse.
"
to
which
mr.
hoddinott,
counsel
for
xerox,
replied,
"no,
sir,
that
is
entirely
opposed
to
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
warehousing
act.
"
now,
there
are,
as
i
have
said,
there
are
passages
in
the
xerox
opinion
which
make
it
clear
that
the
court
was
aware
of
the
distinction
between
property
held
primarily
for
import
and
property
held
for
export.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
an
interesting
question
because
i
suppose
it
was
a
constitutional
decision
under
the
supremacy
clause,
but
decisions
under
the
supremacy
clause
are
rather
different
than
decisions
under
the
due
process
clause
or
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
is
a
decision
which
remains
entirely
in
the
control
of
congress.
if
congress
doesn't
like
the
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
xerox
case,
congress
is
constitutionally
free
to
change
it.
in
such
a
situation,
in
the
absence
of
further
action
by
congress,
there
is
every
reason
to
apply
the
xerox
decision
here.
indeed,
there
has
been
further
action
by
congress,
which
is
to
accept
and
approve
the
xerox
decision,
which
we
think
is
irrelevant
to
any
question
as
to
whether
the
xerox
decision
should
be
narrowed
or
qualified
or
overruled.
the
basic
purpose
of
stare
decisis
is
to
provide
rules
on
which
the
lower
courts,
government
officers,
private
practitioners
may
rely
with
a
measure
of
confidence,
and
a
failure
to
apply
stare
decisis
in
a
situation
like
this
simply
invites
relitigation
of
decided
questions,
thus
contributing
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
law
and
to
the
burden
of
litigation.
now,
i
have
already
referred
to
the
legislative
history.
it
is
perhaps
a
little
odd
to
be
dealing
with
legislative
history
that
is
140
years
old.
but
i
think
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
140
years
old
is
highly
relevant.
these
customs
bonded
warehouses
have
been
in
active
operation
for
140
years,
and
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
congress
likes
them.
indeed,
it
likes
them
so
much
that
in
the
statute
of
two
years
ago
it
extended
this
court's
xerox
decision
to
foreign
trade
zones,
which
are
a
new
development
going
back,
i
think
to
about
1930,
expanding
since
world
war
two,
where
broader
operations
are
allowed,
goods
can
be
put
on
display,
they
can
be
manufactured,
packed,
various
other
things,
and
people
can
come
in
and
look
at
them
and
decide
whether
to
buy
them
or
not,
and
following
the
xerox
decision
counties
in
texas,
the
same
as
in
xerox,
threatened
taxes
on
goods
in
foreign
trade
zones,
and
senator
tower
and
a
congressman
from
texas
introduced
bills,
the
committee
reports
both
refer
explicitly
to
the
xerox
decision,
and
congress
enacted
a
statutory
provision
which
extended
the
xerox
decision
to
foreign
trade
zones.
the
full
text
of
the
statute
is
on
the
bottom
of
page
27
of
our
brief.
incidentally,
although
the
statute
was
passed
late
in
1983,
the
last
line
on
page
27
shows
that
the
amendment
shall
take
effect
on
january
1,
1983,
which
was
18
days
after
this
court's
xerox
decision
on
december
13th,
1982,
and
the
statute
provides
that
tangible
personal
property
imported
from
outside
the
united
states
and
held
in
a
zone
for
the
purpose
of
storage,
sale,
exhibition,
repackaging,
assembly,
distribution,
sorting,
grading,
cleaning,
mixing,
display,
manufacturing,
or
processing,
shall
be
exempt
from
state
and
local
ad
valorem
tax.
but
i
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
went
beyond
this
court's
decision
in
xerox
because
it
also
provides
that
tangible
personal
property
produced
in
the
united
states
and
held
in
a
zone
for
exportation
either
in
its
original
form
or
as
altered
by
any
of
the
above
processes
shall
be
exempt
from
state
and
local
ad
valorem
taxation.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
xerox
case
that
applies
to
goods
produced
in
the
united
states
and
taken
into
a
customs
bonded
warehouse
because
the
customs
bonded
warehouses
aren't
available
for
such
goods.
they
are
under
customs
control,
and
that
is
only
applicable
to
goods
which
are
brought
into
the
united
states,
but
congress
so
liked
the
idea
of
tax
exemption
in
these
foreign
trade
situations
that
in
this
statute
of
1984...
incidentally,
enacted
after
this
case
was
first
started
in
the
north
carolina
courts...
congress
has
not
only
completely
ratified
the
xerox
decision,
but
has
extended
it
beyond
anything
this
court
old
or
needed
to
do
or
could
do.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
this
is
in
part
connected
with
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
whether
this
is
a
constitutional
decision.
i
said,
yes,
it
was,
but
it
is
a
constitutional
decision
which
congress
can
change,
and
this
statute
shows
that
congress
not
only
didn't
want
to
change
it,
they
relied
on
it
as
a
basis
for
extending
the
result
of
that
case
in
a
closely
related
area,
namely,
foreign
trade
zones.
so
i
think
we
have
two
strings
to
our
bow
there,
the
legislative
history
of
1846
plus
the
fact
that
congress
has
very
recently
expressed
its
complete
concurrence
with
and
approval
of
the
decision
which
this
court
reached
in
the
xerox
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
no,
not
at
all.
this
statute
refers
to
the
xerox
decision
which
we
say
is
in
comprehensive
terms,
and
provides
that
property
imported
from
outside
the
united
states
and
held
for
all
these
reasons--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--no...
i
agree--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--i
agree
with
that
entirely.
i
was
relying
on
it
only
to
say
that
congress
not
only
liked
what
the
xerox
decision
said,
but
it
said,
give
us
more,
and
that
is
a
long
way
from
disapproving,
which
congress
has
power
to
do,
congress
can
tomorrow
if
it
could
get
it
through
before
adjournment
pass
a
statute
saying
that
we
disapprove
of
the
xerox
decision
and
all
goods
in
customs
bonded
warehouses
shall
be
subject
to
state
property
taxes.
congress
has
never
done
that
for
140
years.
i
think
it
is
rather
unlikely
that
congress
will.
and
in
large
measure
this
goes
back
to
the
legislative
history.
that
is
covered
quite
fully
in
our
brief
and
in
appendices
b
and
c
to
our
brief.
appendix
b
is
the
committee
report
of
the
house,
and
appendix
c
is
two
speeches
by
mr.
dix,
a
senator
from
new
york.
our
opponents
in
their
brief
say
that
what
the
legislative
history
shows
is
that
congress
was
interested
in
encouraging
import
of
goods
for
transshipment
so
that
they
could
be
assembled
here
and
then
sent
on
elsewhere,
but
we
point
out
that
of
the
first
seven
pages
of
the
committee
report
it
was
related
to
goods
which
would
be
imported,
and
after
that
they
said,
besides,
or
the
second
reason
why
it
is
useful
is
for
the
transshipment.
but
i
would
like
to
call
particularly
to
the
speech
of
senator
dix
in
the
senate
on
july
9th
where
he
was
replying
to
a
contention
that
the
british
system
of
customs
warehouses
on
which
this
legislation
was
based,
that
it
required
that
goods
be
designated
when
they
went
into
the
warehouse
as
to
whether
they
were
for
import
or
whether
they
were
for
eventual
transshipment.
and
he
says
that
his
studies
show
that
this
applied
only
to
goods
which
could
not
be
legally
imported
into
great
britain.
they
will
be
allowed
to
be
taken
into
the
warehouse,
but
they
had
to
be
designated
as
for
export.
he
points
out
in
his
paragraph
4,
"no
goods
which
have
been
warehoused
can
be
taken
out
except
upon
due
entry
for
exportation
or
upon
due
entry
and
payment
of
the
full
duties
payable
thereto
for
home
use.
"
this
shows
that
the
election
is
made
on
withdrawing
the
goods
from
warehouses
and
not
on
warehousing
them.
and
then
in
his
paragraph
3
on
page
25a
he
says,
"all
other
goods
excepting
those
comprehended
in
the
two
foregoing
classes
may
be
imported
and
warehoused
either
for
home
consumption
or
exportation
without
any
declaration
at
the
time
of
the
entry
whether
they
are
intended
for
one
or
the
other,
thus
making
it
quite
clear
that
the
congress
intended
and
understood
that
warehousing
to
apply
to
all
imports
regardless
of
their
eventual
destination.
"
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
deferral,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
an
argument,
as
much
of
mr.
lee's
argument
is,
which
ought
to
be
addressed
to
congress
and
not
to
this
court.
it
was
already
indicated,
mr.
lee
indicated
that
if
there
wasn't...
that
deferral
might
require
payment
now
and
then
north
carolina
would
somehow
or
other
provide
a
refund
if
it
wasn't
eventually
imported.
i
suggest
that
that
is
a
fairly
complicated
legislative
process
which
ought
to
be
left
to
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
often
presents
very
serious
difficulties.
mr.
lee
referred
to
a
provision
in
the
regulations
which
said
that
the
importer
must
make
an
estimate
of
duty
and
taxes.
that,
i
think,
quite
obviously
is
a
reference
to
federal
excise
taxes,
which
are
applicable
to
liquor,
to
many
other
things
which
from
time
to
time
are
subject
to
excise
tax.
i
remember
back
in
world
war
one
when
candy
was
subject
to
an
excise
tax.
if
candy
was
imported
from
france
or
england
would
be
subject
both
to
duty
and
to
pay
the
excise
tax.
now--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--yes.
otherwise
there
would
be
a
discrimination
against
domestic
manufacturers
who
would
have
to
pay
the
excise
tax,
but
it
could
be
made
in
canada
and
brought
in
and
not
pay
the
excise
tax,
so
the
excise
tax
is
applicable
both
to
goods
manufactured
in
the
united
states
and
goods
imported
into
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
would
be
a
discrimination
on
that
ground.
i
would
point
out
in
this
connection
that
north
carolina
itself
exempts
tobacco
from
property
tax
during
its
first
year
as
long
as
it
is
owned
by
the
producer,
so
that
north
carolina
recognizes
a
discrimination.
let
me
say
just
one
further
thing.
mr.
lee
referred
to--
