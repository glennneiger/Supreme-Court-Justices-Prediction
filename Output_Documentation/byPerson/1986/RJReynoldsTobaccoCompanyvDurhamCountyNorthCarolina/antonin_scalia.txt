justice

that
extension
which
you
say
is
an
extension
of
griswold,
by
the
terms
of
that
statute
it
applies
only
as
to
goods
held
for
exportation,
which
is
the
very
issue
here,
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
the
last
provision
that
you
read,
which
you
suggested
was
an
expansion
of
xerox--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
only
applies
to
domestic
goods
put
into
those
trade
zones
for
exportation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
same
as
xerox,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
same
as
xerox.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
be
an
entirely
different
matter
for
purposes
of
assessment
of
the
federal
import
tax
as
well?
and
yet
it
is
clear
that
that
is
not
assessed
immediately
on
those
goods
that
are
held
in
that
warehouse
but
will
later
be
used
domestically
rather
than
reexported.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
surely
that
indicates
that
congress
had
in
mind
a
system
under
which
everything
that
is
in
the
warehouse
is
in
the
warehouse,
period,
because
it
makes
no
more
sense
to
defer
the
federal
import
tax
until
the
point
where
it
is
taken
out
for
domestic
consumption
than
it
does,
as
you
have
described,
to
prevent
the
imposition
of
state
property
taxes
until
it
is
taken
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
think
it
would
be
easy,
if
this
is
what
congress
intended,
to
get
a
statute
through.
i
mean,
if
indeed
they
intended
to
have
the
tax
applied,
what
you
say
makes
it
a
wonderment
that
a
statute
hasn't
been
enacted.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
clear
that
those
excise
taxes
are
payable
when
the
goods
are
in
the
bonded--
