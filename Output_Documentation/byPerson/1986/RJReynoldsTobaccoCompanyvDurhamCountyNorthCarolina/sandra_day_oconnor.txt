well,
mr.
griswold,
is
it
possible,
then,
that
the
state
could
levy
its
tax
and
just
defer
the
collection
until
the
goods
leave
the
warehouse?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
consistent
with
the
federal
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
the
tax
could
be
levied
but
it
just...
the
collection
would
be
deferred
until
the
goods
leave
the
warehouse,
if
they
are
intended
for
domestic
use.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
griswold,
how
should
that
affect
our
interpretation
of
what
congress
intended
so
many
years
ago
when
it
passed
the
act
that
we
are
asked
to
apply
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lee,
the
xerox
opinion
contains
rather
broad
language,
although
on
its
facts
we
have
there
a
situation
of
goods
intended
for
export.
but
the
xerox
opinion
relied
in
part
on
a
d.c.
circuit
opinion
called
district
of
columbia
versus
international
distributing
corporation,
and
that
opinion
in
turn
seemed
to
suggest
to
me
that
the
state
lacked
jurisdiction
to
tax
property
in
these
bonded
warehouses
because
they
have
not
yet
been
in
fact
imported.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
perhaps
to
that
extent
there
is
a
problem
in
your
argument
about
the
meaning
of
the
xerox
opinion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
there
may
be
some
practical
difficulties,
too.
although
in
this
case
apparently
it
is
conceded
that
the
tobacco
will
be
for
domestic
use,
there
may
be
a
variety
of
products
put
in
these
warehouses
where
the
importers
aren't
certain
yet
whether
they
will
be
reexported
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
would
certainly
have
to
have
in
mind
what
you
were
going
to
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
possible
that
congress
intended
at
least
that
state
and
local
taxes
on
goods
for
domestic
use
be
deferred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
are
they
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lee,
there
was
an
old
treasury
department
regulation,
was
there
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
used
to
say
that
these
state
and
local
taxes
were
preempted?
