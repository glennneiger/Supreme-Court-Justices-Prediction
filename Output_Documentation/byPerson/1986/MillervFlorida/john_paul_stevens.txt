why
didn't
the
judge
just
do
that,
and
avoid
this
whole...
just
use
the
old
guidelines
and
find
the
aggravated
circumstances?
justice
stevens
do
you
think...
i
mean,
just
for
purposes
of
deciding
the
case,
should
we
assume
there
are
aggravating
circumstances
or
not?
don't
we
have
to
assume
there
are
none,
because
he
didn't
rely
on
them?
the
legal
question
is
whether
he
needs
them.
justice
stevens
but
the
legal
question
is
whether
the
seven
year
sentence
is
adequate
on
the
assumption
that
he
might
have
found
no
aggravating
circumstances.
