justice
o'connor
mr.
calvello,
as
a
preliminary
matter,
would
you
explain
something
to
me
about
the
effect
of
the
concurrent
sentences
we
see
by
mr.
miller?
he
received
a
sentence
on
the
burglary
and
theft
counts
as
well?
justice
o'connor
and
did
he
receive
a
concurrent
sentence
of
seven
years
on
the
burglary
county?
justice
o'connor
and
the
guidelines
were
not
changed
as
to
the
burglary?
justice
o'connor
so
what
effect
would
a
decision
in
your
favor
on
the
sex
offense
have?
presumably
the
seven
years
would
still
stand
on
the
burglary
count?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
if
the
amendment
did
not
affect
the
burglary
offense,
and
the
guideline
was
not
changed
for
that,
then
even
if
you
are
correct,
would
you
not
look
back
to
the
law
at
the
time
he
was
sentenced
for
burglary,
and
would
that
become
the
primary
offense?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
and
if
that
were
the
case,
then
the
sentence
wouldn't
change?
justice
o'connor
so
even
if
you're
right,
the
burglary
would
then
be
the
most
important
offense?
justice
o'connor
so
it's
your
position
that
it
will
have
an
effect
on
the
burglary
sentence
as
well?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
calvello,
what
if
under
the
law
a
judge
could
go
outside
the
guidelines,
for
good
cause,
for
example.
some
looser
standard.
would
that
then
become
a
procedural
sort
of
a
change?
justice
o'connor
even
if
the
standard
for
departure
is
something
different
that
florida
would
have?
justice
o'connor
than
florida
has
now?
just
a
good
cause,
say.
justice
o'connor
what
about
the
federal
guidelines?
justice
o'connor
or
parole.
justice
o'connor
it's
not
total
discretion.
there's
some
guidelines,
but
they
can
change
it
for
good
cause.
justice
o'connor
the
sentence,
the
parole
guide.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
well,
is
that
procedural
under
the
federal?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
right.
and
for
the
most
part
because
they
treat
it
as
a
procedural
matter.
justice
o'connor
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
agree
with
it,
then?
justice
o'connor
so
does
our
decision
turn
on
just
how
strict
the
standard
is?
is
that
what's
going
to
determine
whether
it's
ex
post
facto
or
not?
justice
o'connor
just
the
degree,
the
difference
in
degree,
as
to
how
strict
the
standard
is?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
sounds
like
that's
what
we're
getting
to.
