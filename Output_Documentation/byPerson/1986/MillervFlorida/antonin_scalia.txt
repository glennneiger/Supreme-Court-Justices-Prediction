justice

so
the
guideline
was
changed
for
burglary
as
well?
justice
scalia
burglary
was
4-1/2
before
and
is
4-1/2
now?
justice
scalia
before
the
guidelines
were
amended,
and
before
your
client
committed
this
crime,
could
he
have
been
sure
that
he
would
get
no
more
than
4-1/2
years?
justice
scalia
it
depends
on
whether
there
were
any
aggravating
circumstances
which
a
trial
judge
would
say
justifies
kicking
it
over
to
the
maximum,
7,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
that's--
justice
scalia
--well,
that
may
well
be.
but
the
fact
is,
he
knew,
in
committing
this
crime,
that
he
was
exposed
to
seven
years'
worth
of
liability.
now,
to
be
sure,
that
exposure
depended
to
some
extent
on
whether...
depended,
if
you
will,
entirely
on
whether
a
trial
judge
could
find
one
of
those
aggravating
factors.
but
could
the
aggravating
factor
have
included
lack
of
remorse,
lack
of
repentance?
justice
scalia
persistence
in
believing
that
what
he
did
was
okay,
and
he'd
do
it
again?
justice
scalia
what
kind
of
grounds
are
there
that
are
valid?
justice
scalia
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
the
ex
post
facto
protection
is
meant
to
prevent
somebody
from
being
surprised,
thinking
he'd
committed
a
minor
offense,
and
it's
suddenly
an
aggravated
offense.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
books
here
said
seven
years.
i
doubt
whether
anybody
goes
ahead
and
commits
it
saying,
well,
there
won't
be
any
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
scalia
it's
still
not
like
the
ordinary
ex
post
facto
case
where
the
individual
at
the
the
time
he
commits
the
crime
does
not
think
there's
a
chance
of
his
getting
any
more
than
4-1/2
years.
here
the
statute
said,
on
the
books,
he
could
get
7
years.
now,
to
be
sure,
the
state,
in
trying
to
be
equitable,
out
of
equal
protection
concerns,
tried
to
channel
the
discretion
of
the
judges.
but
on
the
books,
he
knew
he
was
committing
a
possible
seven
year
offense.
it's
not
the
kind
of
unfairness
that
exists
in
most
of
our
ex
post
facto
cases?
justice
scalia
but
you
can't
give
them?
justice
scalia
you
can't
give
them
unless
you
have
some
special
factor,
right?
justice
scalia
so
in
fact
you
can't
get
seven
years?
justice
scalia
any
trial
judge
can't
give
you
seven
years
just
because
he
wants
to
give
you
seven
years.
justice
scalia
clear
and
convincing
reasons
that
are
reviewable
by
other
courts.
justice
scalia
what
are
those
reasons?
what
are
some
examples
of
them?
justice
scalia
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how
many
of
those
are
foreseeable
by
the
defendant.
traumatic
effect
on
the
victim's
family
probably
isn't.
justice
scalia
reading
a
list--
justice
scalia
--it's
only
the
effects
on
the
victim's
family
that
i
recall
that
is
something
that
i
would
say
is
not
clearly
predictable
by
the
criminal.
so
that
for
all
the
rest
you
could
say
he
carefully
planned
the
crime
so
that
he'd
only
get
the
lesser
sentence,
right.
but
here,
ms.
shearer,
the
effect
of
the
change
of
guidelines
on
this
particular
individual,
as
i
understand
it,
was,
at
the
time
he
committed
the
crime,
the
guidelines
then
in
effect
said
3-1/2
to
4-1/2
years,
and
when
he
was
sentenced,
it
said
5-1/2
to
7
years.
so
there's
no
overlap
there,
is
there?
justice
scalia
it
would
be
difference
in
the
next
case,
if
indeed,
the
prosecutor
hadn't
said,
i
have
aggravating
circumstances
here?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
is
that
what
you're
relying
on,
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
here
said
there
were
aggravating
circumstances,
so
that
he
might
have
gotten
the
longer
sentence
anyway?
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
couldn't
you
have
said
the
same
thing
about
parole?
they
couldn't
be
sure
that
they'd
get
parole?
justice
scalia
well,
you
gave
that
away
needlessly
in
that
case.
they
had
a
parole
system,
but
he
couldn't
be
sure
he'd
be
the
beneficiary
of
it.
justice
scalia
no,
i
understand.
but
your
description
of
why
florida
gave
people
the
option
to
come
into
the
new
system
or
not--
justice
scalia
--was
based
on
the
fact
that,
after
all,
florida
was
abolishing
parole
and
it
felt
that
the
ex
post
facto
laws
required...
guarantee
required
that
this
adjustment
be
made.
justice
scalia
but
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
parole
that
you've
told
us
for
this
new
sentencing
system.
parole
was
available,
but
he
couldn't
prove
that
he
would
gotten
it.
so
really--
justice
scalia
--well,
you
could
say
here,
he
was
entitled
to
be
considered
for
the
lesser
sentence
instead
of
the
seven
years,
that
he
would
have
entitled
to
be
considered--
justice
scalia
suppose
the
basic
statute
says,
the
penalty
for
sexual
assault
is
15
years,
provided
however
that
this
penalty
may
be
changed
at
any
time.
merely
announcing
that
you're
going
to
change
it
ex
post
facto,
does
that
immunize
the
state
from
ex
post
facto
restrictions?
justice
scalia
no,
but
that's
back
to
your
other
argument
that
this
is
not,
after
all,
the
statutory
sentence
or
guidelines.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
your
argument
is
improved
any
by
saying,
moreover,
we
warned
you
that
we
were
going
to
violate
the
constitution.
justice
scalia
well,
you
didn't
put
it
that
way.
but
if
indeed,
it's
an
ex
post
facto
violation,
i
don't
see
how
it's
eliminated
by
simply
announcing
in
advance
that
you're
going
to
do
it?
justice
scalia
so
you
think
that
statute
would
be
okay,
then.
fair
warning:
it's
15
years
this
year,
but
we
may
change
it
anytime
after
you
commit
the
offense?
