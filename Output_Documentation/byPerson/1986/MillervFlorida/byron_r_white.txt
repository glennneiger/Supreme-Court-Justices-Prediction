justice

well,
what
if
after
the
crime
was
committed,
there
were
a
series
of
new
judges
appointed,
and
all
of
them
were...
they
were
known
as
hanging
judges,
they
always
gave
the
maximum.
would
that
be
ex
post
facto?
would
he
have
a
right
to
be
sentenced
by
a
judge
as
lenient
as
the
judge
would
have
been
at
the
time
of
the
crime?
justice
white
so
you
were...
what
your
really
claim
is...
claim
is,
is
that
you
were
deprived
of
leniency?
justice

xxx
some
what
differently
if
the
prison
authorities
had
said...
or
the
legislature
or
someone
said...
here
is
gain
time,
but
we
may
change
it,
may
reduce
it,
may
reduce
it.
and
then
they
do
reduce
it,
so
weaver
would
have
come
out
differently?
justice
white
so
your
answer
is
yet,
if
there
had
been
adequate
notice?
