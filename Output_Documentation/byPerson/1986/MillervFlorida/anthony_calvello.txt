mr.
anthony
calvello
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
miller
is
before
you
today
because
he
received
a
longer
sentence
than
was
authorized
by
the
law
effect
at
the
time
of
his
offense.
the
reason
for
the
longer
sentence
was
that
florida
changes
its
sentencing
guidelines
law
to
boost
the
sentences,
and
applied
that
change
retrospectively
to
mr.
miller.
the
state
says
that
increasing
his
sentence
retroactively
does
not
matter,
because
the
guidelines
are
discretionary,
or
proecedural.
the
serious
flaw
in
that
argument,
as
demonstrated
in
the
briefs,
is
that
departure
from
the
guidelines
is
not
discretionary
and
is
not
treated
as
such
under
florida
law.
this
retroactive
increase
in
the
punishment
imposed
upon
mr.
miller
is
invalid
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
mr.
anthony
calvello
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
calvello
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
calvello
well,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
amended
guidelines
are
concerned.
mr.
anthony
calvello
oh,
no,
no.
let
me
explain
that
point.
under
florida
law,
the
way
the
guidelines
work
is
that
there
is
a
primary
offense,
which
is
the
most
serious
offense
at
the
time
of
the
offense...
at
the
time,
under
the
amended
guidelines
which
we
say
shouldn't
apply,
but
anyway,
under
the
amended
guidelines
the
sexual
offense
would
be
the
primary
offense.
the
burglary
would
be
an
additional
offense,
and
it's
scored
and
calculated
as
part
of
the
total
picture.
mr.
anthony
calvello
under
the
original
guidelines?
mr.
anthony
calvello
that's
a
possibility,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
calvello
oh,
yes,
the
sentence
would
be
changed
dramatically,
because,
see,
the
primary
offense
would
be
the
most
serious
offense
at
the
time.
and
therefore
the
burglary
would
become--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--but
the
sentence
would
go
down
to
3-1/2
to
4-1/2
years;
the
7
years
would
be
gone.
mr.
anthony
calvello
an
enormous
effect.
an
enormous
effect,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
calvello
no,
your
honor
the
only--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--no,
the...
we're
talking
about
under
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
at
the
time
of
the
sexual
offense,
if
you
would
score
the
sexual
offense,
and
the
burglary
as
an
additional
offense,
it
would
be
3-1/2
to
4-1/2
years.
if
you
score
the
burglary
as
the
most
serious
offense,
it's
still
3-1/2
to
4-1/2
years.
but
what
happens
here
is
that
they
changed
the
guidelines,
and
then
sexual
offense
became
the
primary
offense,
and
they
changed
the
points
for
sexual
offenders,
they
added
26
points
for
that.
there's
where
the
7
years
came
in.
so
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
it
was
sex
or
burglary
under
the
old
laws,
he'd
still
get
3-1/2
to
4-1/2.
but
under
the
new
guidelines,
he
had...
the
sex
became
the
primary
offense,
and
he
got
the
increased
sentence
of
7
years.
basically,
under
the
guidelines,
the
florida
sentencing
guidelines
which
came
in
effect
in
1983
abolished
parole.
and
the
florida
criminal
code
was
divided
into
nine
categories,
one
of
which
was
sexual
offenses.
now,
people
are
given
points,
as
i
pointed
out,
based
on
the
severity
of
the
offense.
they're
added
together
and
totalled,
and
you
get
a
range.
and
your
sentence
would
fit
into
that
range,
as
i
mentioned
earlier.
and
the
judge's
only
discretion
would
be
within
that
range,
that
3-1/2
to
4-1/2,
5-1/2
to
7.
and
this
sentence
is
presumptive
under
florida
law.
and
it
is
assumed
to
be
correct
for
the
offender.
the
operation
of
the
florida
guideline
system
demonstrates
that
there
are
meant
to
be
precise
and
narrow
punishments.
the
guidelines
do
not
guide
discretion;
rather,
they
operate
like
a
computer.
you
put
in
the
offender
characteristics,
you
put
in
the
offense,
et
cetera,
and
you
add
it
up
and
you
come
out
with
a
narrow,
mechanically
determined,
presumptive
guideline
range.
and
the
sentence
must
fall
within
that
range,
this
presumptive
range.
moreover,
th
law
adopted
in
conjunction
with
the
guidelines,
and
the
practice
of
the
courts,
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
lower
court,
as
detailed
in
the
brief,
make
clear
that
a
trial
judge's
authority
to
go
outside
these...
this
presumptive
guideline
sentence
is
meant
to
be,
and
is,
extremely
limited.
now,
there
is
a
departure.
but
a
departure
up
or
down,
even
to
go
below
that,
is
not
discretionary.
and
that
is
one
of
the
main
points
i
want
to
make
today.
it
is
not
discretionary.
mr.
anthony
calvello
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
say
no.
because
once
you
implement
these
guidelines,
and
if
you
make
like
florida,
if
you
make
it
presumptive,
an
enforceable
right,
like
here,
because
you
can
appeal
if
there's
a
departure.
there'd
have
to
be
clear
and
convincing
reasons--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--i
would
have--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--if
it's
very,
very
low,
then
there's
a
possibility
that
might
be
something
that
might
not
implicate
the
ex
post
facto
law.
whether
procedural
or
not,
i'm
not
certain,
because
i'd
hate
to
get
into
that
label
when
we're
dealing
with
people's
sentences.
because
you
get
into
what
i
would
consider
to
be
the
most
substantive
matter
there
could
be.
mr.
anthony
calvello
the
federal
parole...
the
federal
sentencing?
mr.
anthony
calvello
the
federal
parole
guidelines.
that
is
an
example
where
you
have
total
discretion--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--they
can
change
the
guidelines--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--the
parole
commissioners
can.
mr.
anthony
calvello
but
here
the
judge
right.
mr.
anthony
calvello
the
parole
guidelines?
mr.
anthony
calvello
the
courts
have
held
that
there
is
no...
ninth
circuit
and
justice
rehnquist
has
held
that
there's
no
ex
post
facto
implication
with
the
parole
guidelines.
mr.
anthony
calvello
well,
what
they
say
is,
they're
discretionary.
they're
not
laws.
there's
no
right
to
an
appeal.
it
doesn't
have
any
of
those--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--i
don't
disagree
with
that,
with
the...
and
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--i
can
understand
the
rationale
of
the
circuit
courts.
but
again,
that
only
points
out
how
different
we
are
in
florida.
we
have
something
that,
to
depart,
you
have
to
have
a
written
reason
that's
clear
and
convincing,
based
on
facts
that
are
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
that...
and
these
factors
can't...
are
not
inherent
or
otherwise
scored
under
the
guidelines.
there's
an
extremely
heavy
burden
under
florida
law
for
departure
from
a
persuasive
and
an
evidentiary
point
of
view.
and
even
if
there
is
a
departure--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--it's--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
calvello
no,
because
what
we
have
here
with
these
guidelines
is
what
would
be
an
affirmative,
enforceable
right
to
receive
these
guidelines.
and
it
is
the
punishment,
it
is
the
quantum
of
punishment
for
this
crime.
and
once
there's
a
change
in
this
quantum
of
punishment,
then
you
have
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
it's
retroactive.
the
state
doesn't
dispute
that.
and
it's
disadvantageous.
the
sentence
went
up
2-1/2
years,
and
there
was
no
departure
in
this
particular
case,
that
he
was
disadvantaged.
so
applying
the
two
prong
weaver
test,
we
have
an
ex
post
facto
violation
in
this
case.
not
only
is
it
difficult
to
depart,
but
very
important,
under
florida
law,
there
is
a
right
to
an
appeal,
an
appellate
review
of
this
departure,
for
the
validity
and
proprietary
of
the
stated
grounds.
and
if
one
of
the
judge's
reasons...
say
he
gives
two
good
ones,
and
a
number
of
incorrect
or
invalid
reasons...
the
court
would
still
reverse,
applying
a
harmless
error
test.
these
guidelines
and
departures
have
been
reversed
under
numerous
grounds,
as
i
indicated
in
my
brief.
over
60
grounds
have
been
found
to
be
invalid,
just
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
they
are
not
discretionary,
that
a
judge
could
deviate
from
them
at
will.
now
under
the
guidelines
in
effect
in
april
of
'84,
mr.
miller's
presumptive
sentence
would
have
been
the
3-1/2
to
4-1/2
years,
but
he
received
a
7
year
sentence.
and
the
reason
for
that,
which
i
wanted
to
get
to,
was
that
the
florida
legislature
wanted
to
increase
the
punishment
for
sex
offenders
by
increasing
the
point
total
for
the
sexual
offense
category.
the
more
points
scored,
the
higher
the
presumptive
sentence,
or
the
quantum
of
punishment
for
this
crime.
the
quantum
of
punishment
was
increased.
and
in
approving
this
amendment,
the
florida
supreme
court
explained
that
this
amendment
to
the
sexual
offense
categories
will,
quote,
increase
the
primary
offense
points
by
20
percent,
resulting
in
both
increased
rates
and
length
of
incarceration
for
sexual
offenders.
thus,
not
only
the
effect
but
the
intent
was
substantive;
to
increase
punishment,
to
increase
the
quantum
of
punishment.
simply
put,
more
people
will
go
to
jail
under
the
amended
guidelines
than
under
the
original
guidelines
which
were
in
effect;
ex
post
facto
violation.
and
this
switch
was
substantial
for
mr.
miller.
because
since
these
guidelines
points
correspond
to
a
predetermined
sentencing
range,
the
base
sentence
for
sexual
offenses
was
effectively
increased.
the
effect,
as
predicted,
was
to
boost
the
point
score.
and
he
received
a
sentence
of
7
years.
there
was
absolutely
no
departure.
this
was
disadvantageous.
it
materially
altered
the
situation.
and
it
meets
every
test
of
this
court
as
articulated
since
1798
in
calder
v.
bull.
it
was
additional
punishment
for
the
offense.
and
it
was
precisely
what
the
ex
post
facto
clause
was
intended
to
prevent.
the
claim
has
been
made
by
the
state
that
these
guidelines
are
procedural,
but
they
are
not
under
florida
law.
because
the
legislature,
in
creating
the
guidelines,
recognized
that
developing
sentencing
criteria
was
primarily
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
in
section
921.001
the
court...
the
florida
legislature
declared,
criminal
penalties
and
limitations
on
the
applications
of
such
penalties
is
a
matter
of
predominantly
substantive
law,
and
as
such,
is
a
matter
properly
addressed
by
the
legislature.
in
this
context,
under
the
florida
constitution,
the
legislature
has
the
sole
responsibility
for
substantive
law,
and
the
court
for
procedures.
so
here
the
legislature
has
declared
that
these
guidelines,
the
whole
guidelines
law,
is
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
mr.
anthony
calvello
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
only
way--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--well,
not
really.
because
if
there
were
these
factors,
then
he
would
have
a
right
to
an
appeal.
that's
lost
by
this
retroactive
increase.
mr.
anthony
calvello
that's
what...
see,
that's
the
disadvantage
to
him,
that
if...
say
he
would
have
got
4-1/2
under
the
original
guidelines.
and
the
judge
says,
well,
maybe...
again,
this
is
speculation,
because
there
wasn't
any
in
this
particular
case...
but
if
there
were
grounds
to
depart,
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
appeal.
he'd
have
the
right
to
get
written
reasons
from
the
trial
judge
that
are
clear
and
convincing,
that
are
based
on
facts
that
are
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
anthony
calvello
no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
anthony
calvello
no,
none
of...
all
of
those
grounds
have
been
found
to
be
invalid
under
florida
law.
mr.
anthony
calvello
there
are
extreme
psychological
trauma
to
the
victim
is
one,
in
certain
cases,
if
it's
not
an
element
of
a
crime,
can
possible
be
a
ground
to
depart,
if
the
facts
are
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
what
mr.
miller
lost,
going
back--
mr.
anthony
calvello
--see...
well...
the...
fair
warning
is
one
element
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
but
so
is...
and
since
the
main
one,
i
would
think,
is
to
prevent
arbitrary
and
potentially
vindictive
legislation.
and
here,
at
the
time,
you
have
a
sentence,
at
the
time
he
committed
the
offense,
where
it
would
be
3-1/2
to
4-1/2
years.
and
then
after
he
commits
the
offense,
you're
increasing
his
sentence.
because
the
presumptive
guideline
sentence
is
the
sentence
under
florida
law.
it
is
not
the
7
years.
it's
not
the
max.
they
changed
the
quantum
of
punishment.
for
example,
it
would
be
like
if
they
took
away
parole,
or
took
away
gain
time
from
somebody,
you
are
effectively
changing
the
sentence.
and
i
think
that's
what's
happening
here.
you
are
effectively
changing
the
sentence.
and
it
had
a
substantial,
a
material
impact,
on
mr.
miller.
mr.
anthony
calvello
oh,
well
as
far
as
the
composition
of
the
bench,
no,
because
we're
not
dealing
with
laws.
here
you
are
dealing
with
a
particular
law.
see,
the
florida
guidelines
stepped
in
to
take
away
the
discretion
of
judges,
if
i
may
add.
so
the
hanging
judges,
quote
unquote,
hanging
judges
are
in
theory,
are
supposed
to
be
eliminated.
but
we
have
these
guidelines,
and
you're
supposed
to
sentence
in
these
guidelines.
that
was
the
whole
idea
of
these
guidelines,
was
to
channel
the
discretion
and
get
away
from
this
concept
of
one
judge
giving
the
max
to
everybody,
and
the
judge
next
door,
who's
more
lenient.
you
have
a
law
that
clarifies
this
and
has
uniformity.
but
what
happens
here
is
that
once
you
have
this
range,
you
have
an
enforceable
right
to
this
range.
mr.
anthony
calvello
no.
no,
leniency
could
have
come
into
play,
your
honor,
if...
if
mr.
miller
wanted
probation,
or
one
or
two
years
in
jail.
his
presumptive
guideline
sentence
was
3-1/2
to
4-1/2
years
in
prison
for
the
offense,
which
the
florida
legislature
and
under
the
guidelines
all
said
is
appropriate
for
this
offender.
it's
not
like
he
came
in
and
said,
give
me
4-1/2
years.
they
said
that
was
appropriate,
and
they
put
it
in
the
law
through
this
guideline
system.
mr.
anthony
calvello
i
think
it's
exactly
the
type
of
unfairness.
it
fits
right
in,
just
like
with
weaver,
where
they
change...
where
they
change,
after
they
go
to
prison.
what
did
mr.
weaver
do
when
he
committed
his
murder?
he
got
15
years,
and
then
they
changed
the
gain
time.
you've
got
to
look
at
what's
happening.
here
you're
changing
the
sentence.
just
like
in
the
main
decision
is
greenfield
v.
scafati.
in
that
particular
case,
people
go
to
prison,
your
honor.
they
got
released.
and
after
they
got
released,
there
was
this
provision
that
said
if
you
violate
parole,
you
would
lose
gain
time.
and
scafati
knew
about
it
when
he
walked
about
the
door.
he
violates
his
parole,
and
he
comes
back
in,
and
they
take
away
six
months
of
his
gain
time
from
his
oentence.
and
the
court
held,
this
court
held,
that
that
was
ex
post
factor,
because
it
effectively
increased
his
sentence.
mr.
anthony
calvello
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
calvello
it
was
a
summary
affirmance,
your
honor.
but
in
weaver,
the
court
relies
heavily
on
greenfield
v.
scafati.
and
so
do
we.
mr.
anthony
calvello
it
was
a
summary
affirmance?
mr.
anthony
calvello
yes,
your
honor.
the
state
hasn't
really
disputed
that
there
was
not
a...
retroactivity
is
not
a
question.
and
there
wasn't
a
real
dispute
as
to
quantum
of
punishment.
the
quantum
of
punishment
changed.
under
florida
law,
the
presumptive
guideline
sentence
is
the
sentence.
and
when
you
change
that
sentence,
you
are
changing
the
punishment,
and
this
is
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
i
just
want
to
quote
one
thing
from
weaver
which
may
crystallize
our
position.
in
there,
the
state
argued
that
the
gain
time
that
mr.
weaver
complained
about
wasn't
part
of
the
sentence.
they
seemed
to
indicate
that
that
wasn't
part
of
the
sentence.
and
this
court
held,
and
i
briefly
quote,
we
need
not
determine
whether
the
prospect
of
gain
time
was
in
some
technical
sense
part
of
the
sentence
to
conclude
that
it,
in
fact,
is
one
determinate
of
petitioner's
prison
term,
and
that
his
effective
sentence
once
this
determinate
is
changed.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
here.
if
it's
not
the
sentence,
it's
a
determinate.
it
has
bee
changed.
and
it
would
materially
alter
the
situation
to
th
accused,
an
resulted
in
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
the
length
of
a
prison
sentence,
which
is
not
subject
to
parole
in
this
particular
case,
and
which
is
determined
by
the
applicable
guidelines,
is
in
the
most
basic
and
fundamental
sense,
a
substantive
matter,
which
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
cannot
be
retroactively
increased.
if
theren't
any
further
questions
from
the
court,
i
have
some
time
for
rebuttal
which
i'd
like
to
reserve.
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
calvello
i
have
nothing
further,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
