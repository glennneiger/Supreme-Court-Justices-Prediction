ms.
joy
b.
shearer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
florida
supreme
court
correctly
held,
in
reliance
on
this
court's
decision
in
dobbert
v.
floria,
that
the
application
of
the
amended
sentencing
guidelines
to
all
persons
sentenced
after
their
effective
date
was
not
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
there
are
three
reasons
which
support
the
ruling
below.
first,
the
guidelines
are
procedural
and
ameliorative
when
viewed
as
a
whole.
second,
that
there
is
continued
judicial
discretion
so
the
defendant
cannot
show
he
was
disadvantaged.
and
thirdly,
that
the
legislature
has
given
offenders
fair
warning
that
the
guidelines
are
subject
to
change.
going
first
to
the
ameliorative
purpose
of
the
guidelines,
the
guidelines
were
drafted
in
order
to
guide
judicial
discretion
and
reduce
disparity
in
sentencing,
and
to
prevent
arbitrariness.
however,
the
punishment
for
offenses
remains
the
statutory
maximum
for
the
crime.
the
statutory
maximum
sentences
have
not
been
abolished
or
altered
in
any
way.
the
effect
on
the
particular--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--they
can...
the--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--the
trial
judge
may
depart
up
to
the
statutory
maximum
if
there
are
clear
and
convincing
reasons
for
doing
so,
which
must
be
set
forth
in
writing.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
well,
in--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--actually,
it's
15
years
for
sexual
battery.
but
the
trial
judge
can
give
15
years,
provided
there
are
reasons
for
doing
so.
and
therefore--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--that
are
reviewable.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
well,
the
court...
in
my
brief,
i've
listed
about
25
reasons.
they
include
careful
planning
of
the
crime,
if
that's
not
a
particular
element
of
the
offense;
premeditation;
traumatic
effect
on
the
victim;
traumatic
effect
on
the
victim's
family;
an
escalating
course
of
criminal
conduct
by
the
defendant,
in
other
words,
going
from
crimes
against
property
to
crimes
against
persons.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
no.
and
i
suppose,
careful
planning,
maybe
not.
an
escalating...
a
crime
binge
behavior,
like
robbing
six
7-11s
in
two
days,
that
sort
of
thing.
they've
also
upheld...
i've
actually
set
forth
in
my
brief
about
25
reasons
that
have
been
approved.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
threats
to
the
victims
and
the
witnesses.
presence
of
drugs
in
a
house
where
children
live.
violating
probation.
excessive
brutality.
using
employees...
i
mean
they're
really--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--no,
that's
true.
the
effect
of
it
on
this
individual
was
that
the
judge
could
give
him
seven
years
without
having
reasons
to
depart,
whereas
under
the
original
version
of
the
guidelines,
the
judge
could
have
give
him
seven
years,
but
would
have
had
to
set
out
some
reasons
for
doing
so.
in
fact,
the
prosecutor
at
the
sentencing,
this
issue
came
up,
and
the
defense
attorney
argued
that
the
original
guidelines
were
in
effect.
and
the
prosecutor
said,
well,
if,
judge,
you
decide
to
use
the
original
guidelines,
then
you
should
consider
departing,
because
there
are
aggravating
circumstances
here,
and
this
man
deserves
seven
years.
however,
i
think
the
'84
guidelines
apply.
the
judge
said,
well,
i
agree,
because
the
statutory
is
sustained.
i'm
going
to
use
the
'84
guidelines.
therefore,
the
seven
years
is
an
authorized
sentence,
and
i
don't
have
to
consider
the
departure
question
any
further.
the
appellate
court,
the
intermediate
court,
the
fourth
district
court
of
appeal
in
florida,
did
reverse,
and
felt
that
it
was
ex
post
facto,
but
specifically
noted
in
its
opinion
that
the
very
same
sentence
could
be
imposed
on
this
defendant
if
the
judge
had
clear
and
convincing
reasons,
and
set
them
out
in
writing.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
that's
exactly
correct.
and
that's
why
we're
relying
so
strongly
on
dobbert
v.
florida.
because
in
dobbert,
this
court
specifically
held
that
when
you
can
only
speculate
that
you've
been
disadvantaged,
but
you
cannot
show
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
mr.
miller
can
only
speculate
that
he
would
have
received
a
lower
sentence.
he
cannot
show
that
his
sentence
would
have
in
fact
been
lower,
because
the
court
had
continued
discretion
to
depart.
now,
mr.
dobbert,
as
you
recall,
had
a
jury
recommend
life
for
him.
and
under
the
prior
death
penalty
statute,
the
life
recommendation
would
have
bound
the
trial
court.
under
the
new
statute,
it
didn't
bind
the
court,
and
the
court
could
override
the
recommendation
and
did
so.
however,
this
court
said
that
mr.
dobbert
had
in
no
way
established
that
in
fact
the
jury
would
have
recommended
life
under
the
old
statute,
and
speculation
was
not
enough
to
show
that
this
had
disadvantageous
effect
on
the
defendant.
we
submit
here
that
it's
clear
that
the
defendant
was
not
subject
to
more
onerous
treatment
because
he
certainly
could
have
gotten
the
same
sentence.
the
prosecutor
urged
the
court
to
do
it.
the
fourth
district
court
intermediate
specifically
told
the
judge,
if
you
want
to,
you
can
go
ahead
and
sentence
him
to
seven
years
again,
but
just
state
your
reasons;
that
this
clearly
shows
that
there
was
not
a
disadvantage,
and
does
not
show
ex
post
facto
violation.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
well,
i
think--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--well,
in
any
case,
that
there's
aggravating
circumstances,
whether
the
prosecutor
says
it
or
whether
the
judge
finds
it
to
be
so.
it's
clear
that
in
order
to
depart,
there
has
to
be
some...
a
finding
of
some
clear
and
convincing
reasons.
but--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--because
the
judge
accepted
the
prosecutor's
argument
which
we're
arguing
today,
that
these
were
procedural
changes,
and
because
the
statutory
maximum
was
unaltered,
that
you
could
simply
use
the
guidelines
in
effect
on
the
date
of
sentencing.
i
think
it's--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--i
don't
think
we
can
assume
there
are
none,
because
the
prosecutor
urged
that
there
were.
the
judge
said,
well,
i
don't
have
to
get
to
that,
because
i'm
using
the
new
guidelines.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
but
i
think
we
never
have
really
decided
ex
post
facto
cases
based
on
what
might
have
been
or
speculation.
he...
mr.
miller
cannot
show
definitively
that
he
would
have
gotten
a
lesser
sentence.
this
case
is
clearly
distinguished
was
weaver
v.
graham,
because
that
involved
a
mandatory
entitlement
to
gain
time
that
was
reduced.
mr.
weaver,
when
he
went
to
prison,
all
he
had
to
do
was
sit
there
and
behave
himself
and
we
was
going
to
get
5,
10,
15
formula
gain
time.
thie
legislature
then
altered
it
and
reduced
it
to
3,
6
and
9.
so
the
mandatory
entitlement
having
been
reduced
changed
the
quantum
of
punishment.
however,
here
florida
complied
with
weaver.
because
when
the
initial
guidelines
were
adopted
october
1st
of
'83,
everybody
sentenced
after
that
date
who
committed
offenses
beforehand,
elected
the
guidelines
or
went
under
the
old
system,
because
florida
was
recognizing
it
was
abolished
parole,
and
therefore
offenders
who
committed
their
crimes
when
parole
was
available
were
entitled
to
not
lose
that,
that
that
would
have
been
ex
post
facto.
but
this
situation,
this
defendant
was
aware
of
continued
judicial
discretion--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--well,
they
had
it
for
the
whole
system.
and
he
was
entitled
to--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--well,
this
defendant
committed
the
defense
after.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
right.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
that's
correct.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
but
he
was
entitled
to
be
considered
for
parole.
i
mean,
defendants
under
the
old
system
were
entitled
to
be
eligible.
but
in
this
case--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--well,
the
trial
judge
could
have
departed
under.
he
could
have
said
there
was
not
enough
reason
to
go
to
the
sentence.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
i
think
that
the
distinction
between
lindsey
and
this
case
is
that
in
lindsey
all
discretion
in
sentencing
was
removed
completely,
because
only
the
15
year
sentence
could
be
given.
but
in
this
case
discretion
existed
under
the
original
guideline
to
depart
up
or
down,
and
it
continues
to
exist
to
depart
up
or
down.
so
it's
continuing
discretion.
now
it
may
be
that
the
discretion
if
reviewable
or
subject
to
certain
constraints,
but
it
still
exists,
and
it's
not
the
same
mandatory
sentence
which
removed
all
discretion
that
happened
in
lindsey.
i
think
it's
clear
in
the
rule
itself
that
governs
the
guidelines,
3.701,
the
statement
of
purpose
is
that
the
guidelines
are
to
guide
and
not
eliminate
judicial
discretion.
section
(b)(6)
states
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
designed
to
aid
the
judge
in
the
sentencing
decision,
and
not
to
usurp
judicial
discretion.
and
section
(b)(11)
permits
departures
for
set
up
a
guidelines
commission
by
statute.
and
this
commission
is
sitting,
it
exists,
it
is
told
specifically
it
has
to
meet
every
single
year.
it
has
to
recommend
changes
to
the
guidelines.
and
it's
supposed
to
take
into
consideration
the
availability
of
correctional
resources.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
no,
it
was--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--i'm
saying
it
gives
fair
warning
to
offenders
that
the
statute
specifically
sets
up
a
commission
to
review
and
continually
revise
and
amend
the
guidelines.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
no,
the
purpose
is
to
benefit
from
our
experience
with
the
guidelines
and
adjust
them
and
fine
tune
them
to
deal
with
problems
that
come
up,
because
this
is
a
whole
new
system.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
well,
i
think
here,
though,
the
guidelines,
where
the
statutory
maximum
stays
the
same.
and
that
hasn't
been
altered.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
well,
we're
not
doing
it
to
violate
the
constitution.
we're--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--well,
but
fair
warning
to
offenders
that
the
guidelines
are
subject
to
change
is
one
of
the
crucial
factors
in
the
parole
cases
that--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--no,
because
that's
the
maximum
sentence
for
the
offense.
and
that...
you
know,
the
defender
is
entitled
to
have
fair
notice
of
the
consequences
of
his
acts.
but
in
this
case,
mr.
miller
had
fair
notice
that
he
would
get
15
years
maximum.
that
he
would
receive
guideline
sentencing;
that
the
court
could
depart
up
or
down
depending
on
the
existence
of
aggravating
or
mitigating
factors;
and
that
the
guidelines
were
subject
to
annual
revision.
there
have
been
two
sets
of
amendments
already
approved
by
the
legislature,
and
there's
a
third
one
pending
in
the
legislature
now.
in
the
parole
cases
areas,
several
of
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
found
that
where
revisions
were
authorized
by
statute,
that
that
did
give
offenders
fair
warning
that
there
could
be
revisions
in
the
guidelines.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
it
may
have,
if
there
was
some
commission
that
was
supposed
to
annually
study
the
problem
and
make
some
determination?
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
yes,
because
that
was
something
important
in
weaver,
that
there
was
no
notice
to
this
man
that
when
he
went
to
prison...
or
actually,
when
he
committed
his
offense,
that
his
gain
time
would
be
altered.
but
here
there
is
clearly
warning
to
mr.
miller
and
other
people
that
the
guidelines
are
going
to
be
annually
reviewed.
the
parole
guidelines
cases
were...
actually,
the
parole
guidelines
were
one
of
the
bases
for
this
state
to
develop
sentencing
guidelines.
on
page
56
of
my
brief
i've
quoted
former
chief
justice
sundberg's
article
discussing
the
guidelines
before
they
were
enacted,
and
he
said
they
came
from
the
parole
guidelines.
for
that
reason,
i
think
the
cases
in
that
area,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
justice
rehnquist's
decision,
which
hold
that
application
of
amended
guidelines
is
not
ex
post
facto
because
discretion
is
still
available
and
because
of
the
fair
warning,
are
clearly
on
point
with
this
case.
in
the
parole
guidelines
area,
departures
also
are
reviewable.
it's
administrative
review,
but
the
standard
is
good
cause.
we
submit
that's
fairly
analogous
to
clear
and
convincing
reasons.
and
again,
in
the
parole
cases
the
guidelines
are
followed
85
percent
of
the
time.
but
the
courts
have
held
that
the
fact
that
they're
followed
that
often
doesn't
mean
that
the
departures
become
substantive...
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
we
submit
that
the
defendant's
cases
are
distinguishable.
as
i
mentioned,
weaver
was
a
mandatory
entitlement,
whereas
this
is
discretionary.
the
rodriguez
case,
cited
in
the
reply
brief,
involved
the
elimination
of
parole
hearings,
which
was
not
the
case
here.
we
submit
that
the
amendments
simply
further
reduce
arbitrariness
and
guide
discretion.
the
defendant
was
not
deprived
of
a
substantial
right
that
was
available
at
the
time
of
his
offense,
because
the
maximum
punishment
remained
the
same.
the
amendments
do
not
remove
sentencing
options,
nor
do
they
permit
consideration
of
matters
previously
barred.
finally,
there
are
policy
reasons
why
the
legislature
should
be
able
to
amend
the
guidelines
and
courts
apply
the
amendments
that
are
in
effect
on
the
sentencing
date.
the
guidelines
really
represent
an
innovative
change
from
the
past
manner
of
indeterminate
sentencing,
with
the
parole
commission
making
the
decision
for
relief.
now
the
guidelines
effectively
the
truth
in
sentencing.
the
parole
has
been
eliminated.
and
we
need
to
benefit
from
our
experience
with
the
guidelines,
and
to
modify
them
as
necessary.
procedurally,
it
would
be
difficult
for
trial
courts
to
be
faced
with
using
several
different
sets
of
guidelines
and
having
to
apply...
figuring
out
which
ones
apply
to
which
defendant.
and
if
it
ends
up
becoming
too
complicated,
it
will
discourage
modification,
because
it
will
result
in
administrative
difficulty.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
i'm
sorry,
what?
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
well,
i
think
that
the
problem
is
that
the
guidelines
have
to
be
continually
altered
and--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--it
would
make
it
administratively
difficult
for
the
courts,
and
it
may--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--well,
because
the
courts
would
have
to,
when
they're
sentencing
a
particular
individual,
determine
the
date
of
his
offense,
and
then
determine
what
guidelines
were
in
effect
then.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
it
can
be.
because
it's
really...
there's
already
three
different
sets,
and
there's
a
fourth
that's
pending
in
the
legislature.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
but
there's
going
to
be
a
fifth
and
a
sixth.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
well,
anyway,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
administrative
problems
are
a
valid
concern.
and
i've
cited
a
couple
of
the
bail
act
cases,
where
the
courts
have
said
that
a
change
in
the
bail
format,
which
makes
it
more
difficult
to
get
bail
on
appeal,
really
only
advances
the
date
of
sentencing,
and
is
not
ex
post
facto;
and
that
administrative
concerns
are
valid,
and
the
court
shouldn't
have
to
deal
with
two
sets
of
bail
statutes
when
deciding
a
bail
issue.
we
submit
that
analysis
applies
here
as
well.
therefore,
in
view
of
the
ameliorative
nature
of
the
guidelines,
the
continued
existence
of
judicial
discretion,
the
fair
warning
given
to
offenders,
and
the
policy
reasons
given,
we
submit
that
the
florida
supreme
court
correctly
relied
on
dobbert
v.
florida.
and
we
request
that
the
judgment
below
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
thank
you.
