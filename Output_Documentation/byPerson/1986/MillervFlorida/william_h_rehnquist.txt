justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
james
miller
against
florida,
no.
86-5344.
mr.
calvello,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
the
court...
did
our
court
hold
anything
in
that
case?
wasn't
it
a
summary
affirmance?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
we
write
an
opinion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
i
asked
you
was
whether
our
court
held
anything
in
greenfield?
chief
justice
rehnquist
without
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
calvello.
ms.
shearer,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
i
suppose
a
seven
year
sentence
could
be
imposed
under
the
later
guidelines,
with
the
finding
of
reasons
on
the
appellate
review.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
shearer,
lindsey
against
washington,
the
case
from
the
'30s
in
this
court,
which
was
certainly
relied
on
in
dobbert
and
i
think
mentioned
in
grant,
there
the
washington
state
legislature
changed
max-mix
sentence
where
the
max
is
15
years,
to
mandatory
15
years.
and
the
court
said,
this
court
said,
that
was
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
and
the
fact
that
lindsey
there
couldn't
show
that
he
might
not
have
gotten
15
years
under
the
old
statute
didn't
mean
that
it
wasn't
a
claim.
because
he
had
to
get
it
under
the
new
statute,
and
that
was
a
disadvantage
in
sentencing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
shearer.
mr.
calvello,
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
