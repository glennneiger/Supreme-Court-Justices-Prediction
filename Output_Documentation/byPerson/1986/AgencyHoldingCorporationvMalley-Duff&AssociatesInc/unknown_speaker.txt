mr.
frantz,
mr.
frantz,--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
wondering
if
the
court
is
going
to
pick
a
statute
of
limitations
for
these
rico
claims?
why
it
shouldn't
turn
to
a
case
like
del
costello
and
try
to
pick
some
analogous
federal
statute
of
limitations
because
so
many
of
these
offenses
cross
state
lines.
it
isn't
the
kind
of
case
like
we
had
in
wilson
and
garcia
where
you
could
more
properly
look
to
a
single
state
cause
of
action.
wouldn't
we
better
served
if
we're
going
to
get
into
this
business
at
all,
in
trying
to,
look
to
an
analogous
federal
statute
such
as
the
one
for
the
clayton
act?
unknown
speaker
well
if
the
goal
of
congress
is
to
deal
with
what
is
often
an
interstate
problem
in
this
area
of
making
civil
remedies
available
for
crimes
such
as
are
covered
by
rico.
why
isn't
national
policy
controlling
here?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
judge
sloviter
in
her
concurrence
took
precisely
the
tack
that
justice
o'connor
is
suggesting,
didn't
she?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
defeated
in
election,
i
guess,
or
he
might
of.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frantz,
doesn't
that
indicate
congress
has
considered
enacting
a
statute
of
limitations
and
has
refused
to
do
so.
so,
maybe
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
get
the
authority
to
pick
and
choose
a
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
we
had
no
authority
to
do
it
before.
this
is
a
kind
of
a
unique
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
we
haven't
followed
that
since
del
costello.
unknown
speaker
in
the
del
costello
case
we
didn't
follow
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
rely
on
any
specific
statutory
basis
for
saying
we
must
look
to
state
law?
you
just
think
it's
a
good
idea
and
we've
done
it
before?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
once
too,
but
we
rejected
that
in
del
costello.
unknown
speaker
so,
maybe
there's
nothing.
but,
it
is
at
least
theoretically
possible
there
would
be
no
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
criminal
statute
of
limitation?
unknown
speaker
five
years.
are
there
any
other
cases
in
which
the
criminal
statute
of
limitations
is
longer
than
the
civil
statute
in
federal
legislation?
unknown
speaker
see,
and
the
anti-trust
law,
i
think
is
shorter,
isn't
it?
four
years
for
civil.
i
can't
remember,
is
it
three
years
for--
unknown
speaker
--civil.
unknown
speaker
but,
it's
sort
of
unusual
to
have
a
longer
statute
of
limitations
to
bar
the
crime
than
to
bar
a
civil
remedy,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
this
is
not
really
a
crime
fighting
tool?
unknown
speaker
just
one--
unknown
speaker
--in
each
state
there
should
be
one?
unknown
speaker
applicable
to
all
sorts
of
rico
civil
claims?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
have
to
go
through,
you're
suggesting
then
that
the,
you
should
look
at
each
particular
rico
claim?
unknown
speaker
so
how
do
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
they
purported
to
take
the
garcia
approach.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
pennsylvania
two
year
statute?
what
is
the
pennsylvania
two
year
statute
applies
to
what?
unknown
speaker
but
the
statute
in
other
states
is
longer
or
shorter
[inaudible].
unknown
speaker
you
may
be
proceed
until
the
red
light
goes
on,
mr.
frantz,
at
which
time
we'll
recess
for
lunch.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
bingler,
i
thought
that
the
sedima
case
from
this
court
specifically
contemplated
recovery
for
damage
inflicted
by
a
predicate
act
upon
the
showing
of
a
later
pattern.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
court
meant
something
else
there,
i
think
there
might
be
trouble
starting
the
statute
of
limitations
running
before
the
pattern
exists,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
the
rico
injury
doesn't
occur
until
there
is
a
pattern.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
accept
the
first
though,
you
have
to
accept
the
second.
i
mean,
if
you
assume
that
there
is
a
rico
violation
after
the
first
act
and
before
there
is
a
pattern,
if
you
assume
there
is
injury
after
the
first
act
and
that
that's
a
rico
injury,
you
obviously
can't
say
that
the
statute
begins
to
run
at
that
point
when
the
individual
would
not
know
to
sue
under
rico,
because
he
has
no
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
would
have
to
wait
until
the
second
predicate
act,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
xxx
and
can
be
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
before
you
have
any
way
of
knowing
you
even
have
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
good
law?
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
possible
to
have
a
cause
of
action
accrue
after
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run
then?
unknown
speaker
second
or
later?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bingler.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
turner.
unknown
speaker
but
why
is
that
any
different
from
any
federal
cause
of
action?
i
mean,
traditionally
we've
looked
to
state
law
whether
we're
compelled
to
by
rules
of
decision
act,
or
otherwise.
that's
what
we've
done.
why
isn't
your
argument
applicable
to
any
federal
cause.
unknown
speaker
things
used
to
better
than
that?
unknown
speaker
you
think
things
used
to
be
better
than
that
in
the
good
old
days?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
very
appealing
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
wouldn't
have
to
deal
with
them
anyway
even
if
we
came
in
under
three
years.
we
could
just
leave
them
for
resolution
by
the
lower
courts
[inaudible].
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
your
preference
is
the,
judge
sloviter's
approach?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
couldn't--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
couldn't
sell
it
to
her
colleagues
on
the
third
circuit?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
blaming
you
at
all,
i
just
was
curious
as
to
what
the
argument--
unknown
speaker
--determined
on.
unknown
speaker
no
one
here
is
urging
that
there
be
a
different
statute
of
limitations
in
a
single
state.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
a
question
of
if
you
choose
a
state
statute,
it's
a
question
of
which
one?
unknown
speaker
and
don't
you
think
that
if
we
stick
with
the
rule
in
this
case
that
we
go
pick
a
state
statute,
why
should
we
differ
with
the
court
of
appeals
about
what
the
most,
what's
the
most,
the
closest
state
statute?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
they
pick?
unknown
speaker
that's
sort
of
like,
that's
almost
like
a--
unknown
speaker
--"#
catch
all".
it's
the
same
idea.
i
noticed
some
of
the
commentators
equate
the
"catch
all"
statutes
with
those
statute
of
limitations
which
simply
say
for
statutory
causes
of
action.
mr.
turner,
i'm
curious,
are
all
three
members
of
the
third
circuit
panel,
pennsylvanians?
unknown
speaker
judge
mansmann.
unknown
speaker
the
clayton
act
should
be
borrowed.
isn't
the
injury,
the
damages
recovery,
and
the
anti-trust
laws
is
for
damages
to
business
or
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
shouldn't
you
look
to
some
state
statute
then
as
sort
of
deals
with
business
or
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
several.
unknown
speaker
at
least
you
would
be
picking
one
dealing
with
business
and
property
rather
than
something
that
doesn't
deal
with
anything.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
you
want,
you
prefer
a
statute
that
deals
with
business
or
property,
the
clayton
act.
unknown
speaker
so,
why
don't
you
pick
one,
why
shouldn't
one
be
picked
in
pennsylvania
that
deals
with
business
or
property?
unknown
speaker
there
certainly
are
several
clearly
dealing
with
injuries
to
business
or
property.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
picked
one
that
doesn't
deal
with
a
thing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
turner,
you
don't
argue
that
a
federal
statute
borrowing
the
clayton
act
would
have
the
advantage
of
uniformity
throughout
the
country?
unknown
speaker
is
it
fair
to
say
that,
as
you
see
the
case,
you
prefer
a
six
year
statute
and
then
you
prefer
a
four
year
statute
and
you
least
prefer
a
two
year
statute?
unknown
speaker
xxx
least
prefer
a
two
you--
[laughter]
xxx.
well,
am
i
wrong?
i
thought
your
first
preference
was
for
a
four
year
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wouldn't
be
under
certain
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
merely
trying
to
rescue
you
from
these
accusations
of
six,
four,
two.
unknown
speaker
xxx
four,
six,
two.
unknown
speaker
i
must
admit
not
to
be
comfortable
with
this
quasi-legislative
role
in
being,
you
know,
presented
a
menu
of
statutes
and
then
sort
of
said,
you
know,
pick
the
one
that
seems
good
to
you.
unknown
speaker
surely
congress
knew
about
this
problem
of
national
uniformity.
if
it
thought
it
was
important
enough
to
have
a
uniform
national
statute
of
limitations,
it
could
have
provided
for
one
very
easily.
in
fact,
as
we've
heard,
some
were
proposed
and
they
were
not
enacted.
so
i
assume
congress
doesn't
care
that
much
about
national
uniformity
here.
unknown
speaker
justice
stevens
is
right.
maybe
they
didn't
want
to
have
any--
unknown
speaker
--since
they
didn't
provide
it.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
much
easier,
i
gather,
for
the
congress
to
resolve
this
question
than
ask
us
to
do
it,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well
maybe
we
might
change
our
minds.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
can
put
that
on
top
of
six
even.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know.
i
was
thinking,
if
you
were
mugged
by
a
criminal
before
he
had
committed
any
other
crime
and
then
he
later
goes
onto
commit
a,
goes
on
to
a
full
life
of
crime,
would
you
say
you
had
been
mugged
by
an
habitual
criminal?
unknown
speaker
now
you're
asking
us
to
legislate
philosophically.
is
that
what
you're
asking
us
to
do?
unknown
speaker
you
said
philosophically.
unknown
speaker
you
just
used
the
word.
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
legislated
that
way.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
turner.
mr.
frantz,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
