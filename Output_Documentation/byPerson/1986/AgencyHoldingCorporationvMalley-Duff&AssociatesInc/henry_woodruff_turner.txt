mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
from
the
litigants
viewpoint
this
case
puts
in
perspective
what
it
is
that's
trying
to
be
achieved
here
i
think.
six
years
into
the
case,
we
have
only
dealt
with,
thus
far,
the
statute
of
limitations
question.
so
our
objective
is
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
clear
and
certain,
in
so
far
as
possible,
statute
be
chosen
and
one
that
is
efficient
in
its
application
to
the
various
and
multiple
fact
situations
that
might
arise.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
well
i
think,
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
proper
and
state
analogy
that
can
be
drawn,
let's
continue
to
look
to
the
state
analogies.
the
difficulty
is,
when
you
get
into
these
complicated
federal
statutes
which
don't
bear
easily
any
analogy
to
the
standard
litany
of
state
statutes
of
limitations,
then
we
are
confronted
with
a
real
difficult
problem
which
leads
to
more
and
more
litigation.
so,
it
would
be
very
nice
to
continue
that
historic
method,
but
i
think
del
costello--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
no,
things
used
to
be
simpler,
your
honor.
and
furthermore,
when
this
pattern
developed,
the
pattern
of
looking
to
state
law,
if
we
assume
that
the
rules
of
decision
acts
did
not
require
that
in
the
1830s
and
1840s
there
was
really
no
federal
statute
of
limitation
law
to
which
reference
could
be
made
in
order
to
draw
an
analogy.
the
only
body
of
limitations
law
of
which
i'm
aware
in
the
early
part
of
the
19th
century
was
the
state
body
of
law
and
of
course,
reference
was
made
there.
and
i
think
it
should
continue
to
be
made
there
unless,
as
here,
there
is
greater
perplexity
deriving
from
reference
to
state
law.
now
mind
you,
we
aren't
forced
in
our
particular
situation
here
to
look
to
federal
law.
we
can
and
we
do
in
our
brief
suggest
a
hierarchy
of
choices
that
could
be
made,
all
of
which
would
result
in
a
timely
filing
in
this
particular
case,
but
which
we
have
listed
in
our
brief
and
what
we
think
to
be
descending
order
of
utility
from
the
point
of
view
of
efficient,
clear
and
certain
application
of
the
statute.
certainly,
if
the
clayton
act
is
resorted
to
as
the
federal
model,
there
will
be
no
real
difficulty
in
each
particular
state
determining
what
applies.
the
clayton
act
will
apply
across
the
board.
it
would
also,
i
might
add,
in
reference
to
mr.
bingler's
recent
presentation,
anything
greater
than
a
three
year
statute
of
limitations
applied
in
this
particular
case
would
enable
deferral
to
be
made
of
the
questions
of
accrual
and
the
inter-relationship
of
pattern
and
the
ten
year
period.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
well,
your
honor,
i
suggest
it
is
because
neither
of
the
courts
below
dealt
with
those
issues
i
might
add.
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
scholarly
comment
on
the
question
of
what
statute
to
borrow,
but
very
little
on
the
questions
of
accrual
and
pattern.
and
i
think
it
would
be
much
happier
result
if
those
issues
were
dealt
with
at
a
time
when
the
lower
courts
had
seen
it
and
when
perhaps
a
trial
had
taken
place
rather
than
as
we
are
here
on
merely
a
summary
judgment
proceeding
where
the
record
is
not
as
full
as
it
might
be.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
as
long
as
the
court
makes
clear
that
they
are
open
questions
and
the
only
reason
i
allude
to
them
at
all
in
our
brief
is
that
i
don't
want
to
find
it
lost
in
the
shuffle
somewhere
because
the
lower
court
indeed,
the
district
court
indeed,
started
the
statute
running
with
the
very
first
event
known
to
my
clients.
and
that
leads
to
very
difficult
propositions.
now,--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--i
am
driven
to
that,
your
honor,
primarily
by
having
discarded
the
notion
that
there's
any
positive
law
that
directs
this
court
how
to
decide
this
matter.
any
statute
of
constitutional
provision.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
given
that
there
is
none,
then--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--your
honor,
i
was
persuaded
of
this
by
judge
sloviter's
opinion.
it
was
in
a
companion
case
that
this
was
urged
on
the
court.
and
i
think
if
judge
higginbotham's
opinion
is
examined
for
the
majority
of
the
court,
they
certainly
recognized
the
value
of
judge
sloviter's
approach.
and
it
seems
from
the
opinion
to
have
been
a
very
close
question
as
to
how
they
would
come
down.
and
perhaps
if
i
had
advocated
more
effectively,
i
would
have
carried
that
group.
plus,
your
honor--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
to--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--that
this
court
is
better
situated
to
make
a
decision
of
this
type
to
follow
say
del
costello
rather
than
the
other
approach.
because
the
lower
courts,
and
i
can
include
the
parties
and
the
courts
in
this
case,
primarily
have
been
fretting
about
what
is
the
closest
predicate
act
analogy?
if
there
is
an
arson,
or
a
illegal
charging
of
interest,
let's,
in
the
rico
allegation
trying
to
match
those
predicate
act
descriptions
up
with
a
characterization
for
statute
of
limitations
and
i
think
it
maybe
this
court
be
the
proper
one
to
instruct
us
all
as
to
the
utility
of
a
federal
choice
here.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
i
don't
think
that's
a
live
issue
here,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
but,
it
has
been
very
much
in
evidence.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
that's
right.
and
i
think
if
we--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--i
certainly
don't
see
any
reason
to,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
selection
assuming
one
is
going
to
follow
the
wilson-garcia
pattern
as
a
model
of
selecting
a
state
statute.
then
i
think
the
third
circuit
did
an
excellent
job
of
discarding
difficult
of
application
statutes
in
selecting
the
so-called
"catch
all"
statute
in
this
case.
now,
the
statute
that
is
urged
by
the
petitioners
here,
the
so-called
property,
personal
property
statute
found
in
pennsylvania
in
section
5524,
was
rejected
by
the
third
circuit.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
they
felt
that
it
was
too
narrow
and
confining.
if
you
read
the
statute
involved
it
talks
about
the
taking,
detaining,
or
injury
of
personal
property,
including
actions
for
specific
recovery
thereof.
now,
that
sounds
to
the
common
law
ear,
like
conversion,
detinue,
common
law
offenses
of
that
sort.
only
last
week-end
did
i
discover
that
when
this
court
was
struggling
to
supply
a
statute
of
limitations
for
the
anti-trust
laws,
prior
to
the
1955
amendments,
that
in
the
chattanooga
foundry
case,
this
very
statute
involving
the
taking,
detention
of
personal
property
was
urged
to
this
court
as
a
choice
for
applying,
for
borrowing
to
apply
to
the
federal
anti-trust
laws
and
the
court,
in
an
interesting
opinion
through
justice
holmes
in
203
u.s.
390,
rejected
that
choice
for
the
same
grounds
that
the
third
circuit
rejected
it
in
this
situation.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
they
picked
one,
your
honor,
involving
statutory
causes
of
action
i
believe.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
a
"catch
all".
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
let's
see.
we
had
judge
higginbotham,
yes;
judge
sloviter,
yes;--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--judge
mansmann,
yes,
we
had
three
pennsylvanians
out
of
three
on
that
panel.
there
are
other
difficulties
i
might
add
with
that
property
model
that's
offered
to
you
because
if
you
examine
the
pennsylvania
statutory
limitations
in
general,
you
will
see
that
there
are
many
other
statutes
which
apply
to
damage
to
business
and
property
that
are
not
a
two
year
statute
as
in
this
detinue
type
statute
to
offer.
fraud,
at
the
time
in
question
here
was
six
years.
securities
fraud
was
three
years.
usury
had
a
separate
statute.
trespass
to
real
estate,
the
slander
to
business,
and
so
on,
was
one
year.
so
there
are
a
great
variety
of
property
type
torts
and
property
type
injuries
which
have
other
statutes
that
apply
to
them.
i
examined
the
ohio
statutes
and
i
find
that
they
have,
for
example,
different
periods
applying
to
damage
to
personal
property
on
the
one
hand,
and
real
property
on
the
other.
so
that
if
arson
was
caused
in
a
rico
circumstance
and
there
be
one
statute
applying
to
the
loss
of
the
building,
and
another
statute
applying
to
the
loss
of
inventory.
even
in
the
more
frequently,
even
in
the
wilson
case
where
this
court
chose
the
personal
injury
model
for
the
1983
violations,
it
started
to
appear
out
in
the
circuits
that
the
personal
injury
standard
is
not
quite
as
singularly
clear
as
one
might
have
thought.
justice
white
and
justice
marshall
in
the
past
year
have
noted
dissents
from
denials
of
certiorari
in
the
pruitan
malden
case.
mr.
justice
white
and
in
other
cases
because
of
confusion
starting
to
creep
in
as
to
which
statute
of
limitations
for
personal
injury
in
states
which
have
diverse
rules
involving
types
of
personal
injuries
which
should
be
applied?
so,
i
believe
that
would
be
more
aggravated
in
this
property
context
than
it
is
in
the
personal
injury
context.
or
i
think
on
the
whole
the
wilson
personal
injury
model
is
probably
a
successful
one.
there
are,
i
suppose,
reasons
that
could
be
further
elaborated
as
to
why
the
clayton
act
model
is
a
good
one
but
when
the
sedima
case
is
examined
and
when
the
legislative
history
is
examined,
it
is
clear
that
the
anti-trust
model
was
very
much
in
the
mind
of
congress.
beyond
that,
i
might
add
as
to
the
legislative
history,
i
think
it's
impossible
to
determine
one
way
or
the
other
what
hints
there
may
be
in
the
legislative
history
as
to
an
appropriate
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
it's
almost
the
same
language,
justice
white,
as
the
language
of
the
rico
statute.
and,
the
concepts
are
the
same.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
i
think
if
there
was
one.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
that's
the
problem.
there
are
several
in
most
states
that
deal
with
various
types--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--oh
well,
if
we're
talking
again
about
which
one
the,
i
don't
think
the
"catch
alls"
don't
deal
with
anything.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
i
think
they
deal
with
something.
they
deal
with
the
situation
that
isn't
otherwise--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
well,
i
think
if
there
was
one
that
clearly
dealt
with
that
i
would--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--that's
right.
there
are
several
in
pennsylvania,
several
in
ohio,
several
in
new
jersey--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--you
pick
one
which
deals
with
situations
not
contemplated
by
the
legislature
to
be
involved.
and
when
you
pick
a
statute
dealing
with
detinue,
or
the
taking
away
of
a
man's
horse,
or
his
watch,
and
how
you
get
it
back,
and
try
to
apply
that,
call
that
a
property
damage
and
try
to
apply
that
to
something
like
rico
then
i
submit
that
the
"catch
all"
statute
is
far
better
because
those
"catch
all"
statutes
must
be
designed
to
do
something
and
what
better
application
to
give
them
than
a
application
like
this
where
there
is
something
unusual
and
unique.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
well,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that
makes
great
sense.
i
wouldn't
be
prepared
to
trample
on
all
other
values
in
order
to
achieve
national
uniformity,
but
where
the
value,
the
other
values
that
are
important
can
be
maintained
along
with
national
uniformity,
i
would
be
prepared
to
take
that.
i
certainly
do
not
stand
here
to
advocate
that
the
historic
preference
for
borrowing
from
the
great
body
of
state
statutes
be
abandoned.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
well,
that
would
be
reasoning
in
the
wrong
direction,
i
think.
we
have
to
approach
this
from
a
much
more
philosophical--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--i
believe
it
is,
when
i
say
preference
i
don't
mean
to
intrude
myself--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--no,
and
i
think,
i
have
tried
to
arrange
it
in
our
brief
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
in
what
we
think
is
the
most
logical
hierarchy
of
choice.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
the
first
being
in
this
situation,
a
national
standard
borrowed
from
the
clayton
act,
four
years.
if
that
is
not--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--oh,
i
understand
that.
[laughter]
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
i
was,
it
was
giving
me
another
opportunity
to
pass
this
over.
you
know,
it's
not
justice
blackman,
any
particular
number
of
years
that
should
govern.
i
think
we
should
divorce
apart
from
any
statute
that
is
too
short
to
be
fair
or
appropriate.
apart
from
that,
whether
it's
two,
three,
four,
or
six,
shouldn't
govern
the
outcome
of
a
matter
like
this.
nor
should
ones
view
on
the
wisdom
or
utility
of
the
underlying
statute,
here
the
rico
case.
i
mean
there
was
some
light
being
made
earlier
about
whether
the
rico
statute
is
meeting
its
objectives
and
so
on,
i
suspect
that
that
is
quite
uninvolved
in
a
consideration,
in
the
quasi-legislative
role
that
this
court
finds
itself
cast
in,
in
selecting
a
statute
of
limitations.
what
i'm
saying
is
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
because
one
didn't
like
the
concept
of
the
statute,
to
therefore
advocate
supplying
a
short
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
i'm
very
uncomfortable--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--well,
i
don't
know
what
assumption
can
be
made
from
the
legislative
in
history
about
whether
congress
cares
about
a
national,
or
doesn't
care
about
a
national.
it
is
my
impression--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--well,
justice
stevens--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--yes.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
yes,
but
the
court
has
said
on
prior
occasions
that
it
will
not
infer
from
the
failure
of
congress
to
address
this
issue,
that
no
limitations
period
is
applied.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
well,
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--to
contradict
that,
although
i...--
[laughter]
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
on
top
of
six,
i
don't
intend
to
deal
any
further
with
the
accrual
issues
other
than
to
say
that
logical
reasoning
is
what
is
required
if
the
court
has
to
deal
with
this
is
quite
apparent
that
a
statute
of
limitations
should
not
begin
to
run
on
any
offense
or
any
right
of
action
until
the
statute
has
ripened
into
an
actionable
cause.
until
the
events,
the
facts,
have
made
out
sufficient
data
from
which
a
complaint
could
be
drawn
stating
a
prima
facie
case.
stating
a
cause
of
action
under
rule
12(b)6.
it's
easy
enough
to
explain
how
we
get
to
this
point
in
the
case,
in
the
third
circuit
in
attempting
to
remind
the
court
not
to
foreclose
the
accrual
issue,
i
pointed
out
that
at
the
time
the
district
court
started
the
clock
running
as
it
were,
only
one
predicate
act
as
alleged,
had
occurred.
and
that
therefore,
the
statute
could
scarcely
have
accrued
at
that
point
in
time.
and
that
is
what
has
become
known
as
the
concession,
or
the
admission
that
at
the
time
of
an
initial
point
of
injury
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
pattern
in
effect.
and,
of
course,
there
wasn't
if
one
assumes
the
statutory
scheme
here.
the
congress
said
that
if,
that
the
actionable
events
are
operating
through
a
pattern.
the
pattern
is
defined
as
two
events.
and
so
what
is,
at
a
minimum
two
events,
and
with
the
element
of
continuity
added
to
it.
and
so
the
first
event,
although
not
starting
the
statute
runnings,
statute
of
limitations
running,
still
when
a
pattern
does
exist
and
comes
into
fullness
of
itself,
it
surely
caught
back
up
in
it
for
damage
purpose.
that
you
could
recover
damages
for
that
earlier
act
which
is
part
of
this
greater,
greater
whole.
and
i
suspect
that
in
the
criminal
area
it
wouldn't
be
urged
that
somehow
the,
no
consequences
could
flow
criminally
from
the
first
act
of
a
rico
conspiracy.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
it
depends
on
when
i
said
it.
if
i
said
it
when
i
was
first
mugged,
no,
because
i
had
no
reason
to
know
that
it
was
a
habitual
criminal.
but
if
upon
being
shown
his
sheet
a
year
later
and
saw
that
he
had
done
this
to
others,
i
think
so.
i
appreciate
the
effort
to
find
an
analogy
of
the
two
or
more
events
that
are
required
to
trigger
liability,
i
have
been
unsuccessful
in
formulating
an
analogy
or
some
other
area
of
law
where
this
exists
to
see
how
it
would
be
treated
there.
so
i
think
we're
reduced
in
all
probability
to
contemplating
this
as
a
logical
and
more
a
philosophical
point
to
see
how,
it
should
be
viewed
and
it
certainly
shouldn't
be
viewed
to
allow
in
a
civil
context
a
party
to
take
its
heaviest
blow
as
its
first
one.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
well,
you
honor,
if
accrual
rules
have
developed--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
yes,
i
think
it
has
to
be
approached
that
way.
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
well,
i
don't
think
when
we
get
to
accrual
we're
talking
about
legislation
any
longer,
because,
or
interstitial
legislation
because
the
accrual
rules
are
clearly
federal
in
nature
and
to
be
defined
by
this
court
so
that
it
is
not
philosophical
legislation
in
that
area,
you
honor,
it
is
attempting
to
formulate
rules
of
accrual
for
what
appears
to
be
a
relatively
unique
and
type
of--
mr.
henry
woodruff
turner
--thank
you,
your
honor.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
will
conclude.
