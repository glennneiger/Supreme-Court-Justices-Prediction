mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent,
malley-duff
in
this
case
asks
this
court
to
ignore
the
causation
element
in
the
civil
rico
statute
and
abandon
the
generally
applicable,
usually
applied
federal
civil
accrual
rule
in
order
to
first
create
and
then
preserve
for
malley-duff
a
rico
cause
of
action.
the
generally
applicable
federal
civil
accrual
rule
focuses
on
the
clear
and
certain
event
of
injury
and
works
well
where
a
plaintiff
can
trace
his
cause
of
action
to
a
completed
violation,
whether
it's
a
rico
violation
or
any
other
kind
of
violation.
abandoning
this
general
rule
will
minimize
the
effect
of
any
statute
of
limitations
this
court
adopts.
there
is
no
reason
to
abandon
it
in
favor
of
a
plaintiff
injured
by
the
first
in
what
turns
out
to
be
a
series
of
events
that
eventually
form
a
pattern.
and
the
reason
is
that
that
plaintiff
just
hasn't
been
injured
by
reason
of
a
rico
violation.
that
plaintiff
cannot
casually
trace
his
cause
of
action
to
a
completed
rico
violation.
he
may
have
many
other
causes
of
action,
just
not
a
rico
violation.
the
principles
of
cause
and
effect
suggest
that
causes
have
got
to
proceed
effects.
the
plaintiff
injured
by
the
first
in
a
series
of
predicate
rico
offenses
just
is
not
injured
by
a
rico
violation.
he
may
be
injured
by
a
predicate
act,
but
he's
not
injured
by
reason
of
a
rico
violation.
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
did
not
address
that
particular
question
because
they
applied
a
six
year
statute
of
limitations
which
makes
the
accrual
question
not
come
into
existence.
and
they
did
not
address,
specifically
did
not
address
the
question
of
whether
or
not
plaintiff,
and
we
say
plaintiff
has
conceded
that
as
of
the
time
it
was
injured
there
was
no
rico
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
back
and
i
think
noted
in
a
footnote
that
since
they
didn't
buy
what
the
plaintiff
was
saying
that
events
that
occurred
in
chicago
and
cleveland
and
other
places
alleged
in
the
plaintiff's
complaint
did
make
out
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
in
advance
of
the
plaintiff's
injury.
plaintiff
as
we
understand
it,
both
in
the
circuit
court
and
before
this
court
has
contended
that
until
a
pattern
subsequent
to
its
injury
took
place
there
was
no
rico
violation.
our
view
is
that
that's
an
effort
to
avoid
the
potential
of
a
two
year
statute
of
limitations
that
this
court
might
adopt.
frankly,
it
has
a
potential
of
avoiding
any
statute
of
limitations
because
it
makes
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
running
of
the
statute
depend
on
the
very
uncertain
concept
and
i
think
just
a
quick
reading
of
some
of
the
circuit
court
and
district
court
cases
on
what
it
is
that
makes
a
pattern
will
demonstrate
to
any
reader
that
the
concept
is
very
uncertain
and
it's
probably
going
to
stay
uncertain
in
any
particular
case.
mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
sedima
went
quite
that
far.
i
think
sedima
attempted
to
say,
if
you
can
trace
your
injury
to,
and
using
the
"by
reason
of"
language,
to
a
rico
violation
through
a
predicate
act
then
you
can
recover.
you
don't
have
to
trace
it
to
a
confluence.
you
don't
have
to
trace
it
to
a
racketeering
injury.
our
point
is
that
sedima
should
be
limited
to
defendant's
who
have
completed
a
rico
violation
as
of
the
time--
mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
--that
presents
a
problem,
your
honor,
but
not
an
unsolvable
one
because
we
would
still
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
general
federal
accrual
rule
that
starts
the
statute
running
at
the
point
of
injury.
there
are
other
kinds
of
causes
of
action
where
that
does
occur
and
the
reason
we
suggest
that
the
court
do
that
is
that
the
pattern
concept
is
simply
too
uncertain.
we
suggest
that
the
court--
mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
--that's
a
possible
reading
of
sedima,
your
honor.
my
reading
of
sedima
is
that,
and
my
suggestion
to
the
court
is
that
sedima
should
be
limited
to
mean
that
if
you
can
trace
your
injury
to
a
completed
rico
violation,
all
of
the
elements,
not
only
a
pattern
but
an
enterprise
and
so
on,
through
a
particular
predicate
act,
tracing
backward,
our
point
given
the
plaintiff's
concession
that
as
of
the
time
it
was
injured
there
was
no
pattern
is
that
as
of
the
time
it
was
injured
it's
physically,
causally
impossible
to
trace
its
violation
to
an
existing
rico
violation.
as
of
the
time
it
was
injured,
and
i'm
talking
just
about
the
termination
injury,
as
of
the
time
it
was
injured
the
defendants
could
not
be
prosecuted
by
a
prosecutor
for
a
rico
violation
because
no
rico
violation
had
occurred.
the
problem
with
the
seductive
language
of
pattern
is,
it's
not
like
conspiracy.
a
pattern
can
occur
totally
unintentionally
and
our
suggestion
is
that
the
court
not
allow
the
pattern
concept
to
pull
pre-rico
violation
injuries
into,
ripen
them
into
a
rico
violation.
the
accrual
question
comes
up
when
not
only
does
the
plaintiff
want
its
cause
of
action
ripened,
it's
non-rico
cause
of
action
ripened
into
a
rico
cause
of
action,
it
wants
the
accrual
rule,
the
general
civil
accrual
rule,
which
focuses
on
the
definite,
clear,
certain,
easy
to
ascertain
event
of
injury,
or
should
have
known
of
injury,
it
wants
the
court
to
preserve
that
somehow.
preserve
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
until
such
time
as
perhaps,
perhaps
ten
years
if
the
defendants
happen
to
be
incarcerated,
perhaps
twenty
years
because
of
the
pattern
concept,
two
event
in
ten
years
except
that
the
defendants
are
incarcerated,
it's
suspended
[inaudible].
mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
think
the--
mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
--there
are
situations
where
that
doesn't
come
up.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
pennsylvania
for
example,
under
the
no-fault
action
which
says
you
don't
have
a
tort
cause
of
action
until
such
time
as
you
have
accumulated
a
certain
level
of
damages,
a
certain
number
of
medical
bills
and
so
on,
you
just
don't
have
a
tort
cause
of
action.
the
cases
in
pennsylvania
and
other
states
that
have
looked
at
that
have
said,
that's
okay,
we
don't
want
to
have
to
worry
about
the
uncertain
event--
mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
--in
fact,
there's
a
superior
court
case
in
pennsylvania,
your
honor,
that
we
did
not
cite
because
i
came
across
it
yesterday
looking
at
this
particular
question.
mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
i
think
it
is,
because
it's,
the
important
element
here
is
to
have
a
certain
determined
point.
otherwise
you
might
as
well
forget
whatever
statute
of
limitations
the
court
adopts.
because,
not
only
do
you
get
the
uncertain
event
of
pattern,
but
you
get
the
plaintiff
in
control
of
when
he
proves
the
pattern.
and
the
defendant
in
the
peculiar
position
of
coming
in
and
saying,
well
though
i
engaged
in
a
lot
more
predicate
acts
than
the
plaintiff
says
i
did
and
so
the
statute
ran
out
long
before
the
plaintiff
says
it
did.
whatever
statute
of
limitations
accrual
rule
this
court
adopts,
it
shouldn't
get
schizophrenic
proof
motives
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant.
it
should
make
sure
that
the
plaintiff
is
not
only
trying
to
prove
his
pattern,
but
trying
to
prove
it
happened
in
a
hurry.
otherwise
if
you
adopt
a--
mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
--excuse
me.
mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
unless
this
court
holds
that
the
plaintiff
must
trace
its
injury
to
an
existing,
completed
rico
violation.
mr.
john
h.
bingler,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
by
mr.
frantz.
thank
you.
