mr.
robert
l.
frantz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
address
two
of
the
three
questions
on
which
certiorari
was
granted.
first
i
will
argue
that
choosing
the
most
appropriate
statute
of
limitation
for
all
rico
claims,
this
court
should
follow
its
analysis
in
wilson
v.
garcia
and
should
direct
that
the
statute
of
limitations
for
injuries
to
business
or
property
each
state
should
be
applied
to
all
civil
rico
claims.
in
pennsylvania,
that
statute
is
section
5524.
secondly,
i
will
argue
that
rico
does
not
provide
a
civil
remedy
to
a
plaintiff
when
as
respondent
admits
and
even
argues
there
is
neither
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
or
a
conspiracy
to
violate
rico
at
the
time
of
its
injury.
mr.
bingler,
co-counsel
will
argue
that
the
general
federal
civil
approval
should
be
applied
in
civil
rico
actions.
that
is
that
a
cause
of
action
accrues
when
the
plaintiff
knows,
or
should
of
known
of
his
injury.
this
court
has
inferred.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
analogous
federal
statute
should
not
be
looked
to
unless
the
state
statute
is
inconsistent
with,
or
frustrates
the
federal
policy,
such
as
the
court
found
the
30
day
statute
in
maryland
and
the
90
day
statute
in
new
york
frustrated
the
federal
labor
policy
in
del
costello.
now,
it's
true--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--we
think
that
federal
policy
does
control,
your
honor.
and
it
may
be
that
the
activities
take
place
in
different
states,
but
the
injury
usually
only
takes
place
in
one
state.
in
this
case,
the
injury
took
place
in
pennsylvania.
the
plaintiff
sued
in
pennsylvania.
so
you
would
look
at
pennsylvania
law
and
apply
it
just
as
you
did
in
the
section
1983.
you
didn't
deal
with
section
1983
cases,
but
the
court
did
in
1983
[inaudible],
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
judge
sloviter,
in
her
concurrence
and
she
was
one
of
three
judges.
and
we
think
that
that
specific
statute
is
more,
it
seems
to
be
more
likely
that
it
should
be
applied
and
in
fact,
it
is.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
the
legislative
history
of
rico.
as
you
may,
as
you
know,
when
the
congress
first
started
thinking
about
attacking
organized
crime
they
were
going
to
bring
it
under
the
anti-trust
law.
and
if
they
brought
it
under
the
anti-trust
laws,
the
four
year
clayton
act
statute
of
limitations
would
have
applied.
they
specifically
rejected
bringing
it
under
the
anti-trust
laws.
they
brought
it
in
a
separate
act
apart
from
the
anti-trust
laws.
now,
i
believe
it
was
representative
steiger
from
arizona,
stored
up
when
it
was
going
through
the
congress
and
he
said,
let's
put,
among
other
things,
a
statute
of
limitations
on
this
act.
he
was
asked
to
withdraw
that
because
they
were
moving
it
through
congress
and
the
statement
was
made,
you
can
come
back
another
day.
he
never
did
come
back
another
day,
but--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--on
two
occasions
after
that,
the
senate
of
the
united
states
did
pass
a
statute
of
limitations.
but
it
wasn't
the
four
year
clayton
act,
it
was
a
five
year
statute
of
limitations.
the
senate
passed
it,
but
the
house
judiciary
committee
did
not
move
it
out
of
committee.
so,
on
two
occasions,
immediately
after
it
was
enacted,
the
house
said
no
to
a
five
year
statute.
now,
more
recently,
just
last
october,
the
house
passed
a
three
year
statute
of
limitations.
the
senate,
by
a
vote
of
47
to
44
failed
to
attach
it
to
a
bill
that
would
have
made
rico
a
three
year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
well,--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--i
think
we
get
the
authority
from
this
court
has
found
for
over
a
century--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--well,
the
statute
may
be
unique
but
the
principle
of
supply,
looking
to
the
states
for
a
state
statute
of
limitation
when
congress
fails
to
include
a
statute
of
limitation
goes
back
[inaudible]--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--pardon
me?
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
we
didn't
because
we
said,
or
this
court
said
that
a
30
day,
or
even
a
90
day
statute
of
limitations
that
would
have
been
provided
by
the
state
was
inconsistent
with
the
federal
policy
of
having
labor
disputes
worked
out
and
then
giving
the
plaintiff
an
adequate
time.
and
in
del
costello,
the
adequate
time
was
only
six
months.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
i
don't,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
rules
of
decision
act
was
originally
considered
as
the
basis
for
applying
state
law.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
right.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
there
was
no
statute
of
limitation
in
the?
occidental--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--versus
the
e.e.o.c.
case
and
for
very
good
reason,
because
in
that
case,
we
were
encouraging
people
to
exhaust
the
e.e.o.c.
administrative
procedural
remedies.
and
you
didn't
want
someone
have
to
file
a
case
and
then
sit
on
it
for
two,
three,
four
years
while
it
was
going
through
the
e.e.o.c.
practice.
except
in
those
very
unusual
cases
when
there's
a
very
short
statute
of
limitations,
or
as
in
the
jones
act,
there's
such
a
short,
you
have
the
relationship,
three
year
jones
act
statute
of
limitations
and
if
you
bring
an
unseaworthiness
claim,
you
have
to
bring
the
two
together
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
states
could
not
have
a
shorter
statute
of
limitations
than
is
provided
in
the
jones
act.
but,
they
are
the
unusual
situations
and
when
congress
does
enact
a
statute
that
does
not
have
a
statute
of
limitation,
this
court
has
said
that
it
infers
that
congress
intends
that
the
state
statute
of
limitation,
the
appropriate
state
statute
of
limitation
should
apply.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
five
years.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
i
am
not
familiar
with
[inaudible].
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
four
years
in
civil.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
and
i
haven't
addressed
the
criminal--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--we
think
so,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
we
pointed
out
that
over
the
history
of
rico,
since
its
enactment
in
1970,
there
was
talk
in
the
respondent's
brief
and
talk
in
the
amicus
brief
that
the
civil
rico
action
was
going
to
be
used
to
eradicate
organized
crime.
and,
so
far,
in
our
search
which
is
using
this
marvelous
lexus
tool,
we
checked
every
named
criminal
defendant
in
a
reported
criminal
rico
case
and
came
up
with
1362
names.
and
then
we
checked
the
civil
rico
cases
and
we
found
that
there
were
only
five
civil
rico
cases
that
had
any
of
those
same
individuals
named
as
a
defendant
in
a
civil
rico
action.
and,
of
those
five
there
was
only
one
case
that
arguably
involved
what
we
would
think
of
as
organized
crime.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
it's
not
really
a
crime
fighting
tool.
most
people
aren't
going
to
try
to
sue
some
columbian
drug
runners
for
some
money.
life's
too
short.
it's
not
like
going
after
general
motors
under
an
antitrust,
or
general
electric,
or
westinghouse.
life's
too
short
to
go
after
somebody
who's
going
to,
who
thinks
nothing
of
killing
people
and
doing
that.
so,
we
don't,
for
that
reason,
we
think
the
two
year
statute
that
pennsylvania
would
apply
would
be
very
appropriate.
not
too
short
by
any
means
and
since
it's
not
inappropriate
and
would
not
frustrate
the
federal
law
we
believe
that
that
would
be
the
appropriate
approach
for
this
court.
and
we
think
the
steps
that
were
outlined
in
wilson
v.
garcia
are
appropriate
to
follow
in
this
case.
in
wilson
v.
garcia,--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--in
each
state.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
there
should
be--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--rico,
there
must
be
a
hundred
different
types
of
rico
claims,
just
as
in
wilson-garcia,
this
court
said
there
could
be
any
number
of
infringements
of
civil
rights.
and
therefore,
you
said
that
you
looked
at
the
nature
of
the
injury,
not
the
cause.
not
whether
he
was
hit
over
the
head
with
a
bat,
not
whether
he
was
[inaudible]--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--no,
not
each
particular
rico
claim.
i'm
suggesting
that
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
right
that
was
given
by
the
rico
statute
just
as
you
looked
in
wilson
at
the
nature
of
the
right
in
section
1983.
this
nature
of
the
right
there
was
protection
of
personal
rights.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
well,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals,
they
said
in
their
own
opinion,
that
they
were
looking
for
an
epiphany.
they
said
they
couldn't
find
the
nature
[inaudible].
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
they
purported
to,
but
where
they
went
wrong,
your
honor,
we
submit
is
they
looked
at
all
the
different
types
of
injuries.
now,
you
don't
look
at
the
types
of
injuries,
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
injury
that
the
law
is
protecting.
and
in
rico,
congress
spelled
it
out
in
section
1964(c).
it
said,
you
are
given
a
right
of
action
if
you
are
injured
in
your
business
or
property.
just
like
in
civil
rights,
it
was
a
personal
right
of
action,
because
your
personal
rights
had
been
injured,
so
you
looked
at
personal
injury
in
wilson
v.
garcia.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
the
pennsylvania
two
year
statute
applies
to
injury
to
personal
property,
injury
to
real
property.
and
the
statute
under
injury
to
personal
property
has
been
construed
by
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
and
adopted
by
the
pennsylvania,
the
third
circuit,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but
it
includes
injury
to
business,
tortious
interference
with
business.
so,
that
particular
statute
would
cover
injury
to
business
or
property
and
we
find
that
in
every
state
there
is
a
provision
for
a
statute
of
limitation
for
injury
to
personal
property.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
it
may
in
other
states
be
longer
and
shorter.
in
fact,
there
is
only
one
state
in
the
country
where
it
is
less
than
two
years
and
that's
louisiana,
and
it's
one
year
in
louisiana.
but
in
every
other
state
it's
two
years
or
more.
so
he
don't
think
that
the
shortness
of
that
statute
would
make
it
inconsistent
with
the
federal
policy.
i
don't
know,
your
honor,--
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
--all
right.
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
we
think
is
answered
by
it
being
a
congressional
directive
that
you
are
protecting
injury
to
business
or
property.
not
personal
injury,
just
injury
to
business
or
property.
so,
in
each
state,
the
court
should
look
to
the
statute
in
that
state.
that
is,
the
statute
of
limitations
for
injury
to
business
or
property.
and
that
way,
every
state
will
have
the
certainty
and
the
avoidance
of
unnecessary
litigation
by
looking
at
that
particular
statute
and
your
question
will
be
answered.
now,
i
think
i've
answered,
i
hope
i've
answered
your
questions
on
that
particular
argument.
the
other
argument
i
was
making
is
that
in
this
particular
case
we
have
an
unusual
circumstance.
the
plaintiff,
the
respondent
has
admitted,
in
fact
it
argued
in
its
brief
to
the
third
circuit,
as
it
did
in
this
court,
that
it
had
no
cause
of
action
at
the
time
its
insurance
agency
was
terminated.
they
have
cause
of
action
for
later
events
that
took
place
down
the
road
later,
but
it
said
it
had
no
cause
of
action
at
the
time
it
was
terminated.
so,
if
it
said
there
was
no
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
at
the
time
it
was
terminated.
it
said
that
it
had
no
cause
of
action,
it
said
there's
no
conspiracy
to
commit
further
causes
of
action
at
the
time
it
was
terminated.
now,
we
agree
that
there
was
no
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
and
we
agree
that
there
was
no
conspiracy
to
commit
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
at
that
time.
where
we
disagree
is
the
respondent's
position
that
something
that
takes
place
two,
three
years
down
the
road,
all
of
a
sudden
relates
back
and
causes
the
first
act
at
termination
of
its
agency
to
ripen
into
a
rico
cause
of
action.
we
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
something
that
takes
place
later
can
be
the
cause
of
the
respondent's
injury
and
since
section
1964(c)
gives
a
cause
of
action
if
you've
been
injured
by
reason
of
a
violation
of
the
provisions
of
the
act,
and
the
violations
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
all
require
either
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
or
a
conspiracy
to
commit
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
we
submit
that
there
was
no
rico
cause
of
action.
now,
that's
not
to
say
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
cause
of
action
as
a
matter
of
civil
right.
this
respondent,
in
fact,
in
another
case
has
plead
anti-trust
violations,
breach
of
contract,
tortious
interference
for
the
contract.
if
there
had
been
a
crime,
the
crime
on
that
first
act
would
have
been
subject
to
indictment
and
conviction,
but
there
is
no
free
first
crime.
you'll
pay
the
price
if
you
commit
a
crime.
this
court,
or
this
act,
the
congress
was
not
trying
to
legislate
against
the
dog
fight.
as
the
respondent
said,
we
want
a
free
first
bite.
what
rico
was
designed
to
do
was
to
attack
the
wolf
packs
of
our
nation.
mr.
robert
l.
frantz
your
honor,
one
minute,
very
quickly.
detinue
is
a
red
herring.
the
court
in
the
third
circuit
adopted
the
findings
of
the
superior
court
and
the
lower
courts
in
pennsylvania
that
the
personal
property
act,
5524c
covers
injury,
tortious
injury
to
business.
this
is
1987,
this
is
not
1906.
in
1906,
justice
holmes
deferred
to
a
former
supreme
court
justice
of
tennessee
who
said
that
the
personal
property
injury
statute
in
tennessee
only
applied
to
tangible
property.
today
in
pennsylvania
and
around
the
country,
personal
property
statutes
apply
to
intangible,
they
apply
to
business.
if
somebody
burns
down
your
barn,
it's
your
business.
whether
it's
a
barn
or
whatever
it
is,
it's
your
business.
a
cause
of
action
that
hasn't
been
mentioned
by
anyone
is
section
1962(d),
the
conspiracy
statute.
if
the
time
someone's
injured
there
is
in
existence
a
conspiracy
to
commit
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
there
is
a
cause
of
action
at
that
time.
thank
you,
your
honor.
