mr.
peter
edward
scheer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
art
taylor's
position
in
this
case
is
two-fold.
first
of
all,
we
contend
that
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
regarding
removal
of
jurisdiction
was
exactly
correct
and
that
proper
application
of
removal
principles
precluded
the
removal
of
this
case
to
federal
court
without
regard
for
any
of
petitioner's
preemption
arguments.
secondly,
even
if
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
regarding
removal
was
incorrect,
this
case
still
could
not
have
been
removed
to
federal
court
because
none
of
respondent
taylor's
state
law
breach
of
contract
claims
were
in
fact
preempted
by
erisa,
much
less
supplanted
by
a
substitute
erisa
cause
of
action.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
if
the
court
decided
in
the
pilot
life
decision
that
the
savings
clause
of
section
514
did
not
save
the
type
of
state
law
claim
brought
by
dedeaux,
i
would
not
be
able
to
meaningfully
distinguish
that
decision
from
the
state
law
claims
involved
here.
and,
i
would
like
to
speak
just
very
briefly--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--well,
all
i
mean
to
say
is
that
the
nature
of
respondent's
breach
of
contract
claims
against
the
insurance
company,
metropolitan
life
in
this
case,
are
not
meaningfully
distinguishable
in
my
mind
from
the
state
law
claims
in
pilot
life,
the
purposes
of
the
erisa
savings
clause.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
no,
it
would
not,
if
the
court
accepts
our
removal
theory.
our
removal
theory
is
as
follows:
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--that's
correct.
even
if
this
court
now
decides
in
the
pilot
life
case,
for
example,
that
there
was
preemption--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--we
would
still
win
on
our
removal
theory.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
our
removal
theory
is
as
follows:
it
is
that,
as
the
court
below
held,
that
taylor's
breach
of
contract
claim
against
the
insurer
was
not
properly
removable
because
it
was
not
obvious,
and
obvious
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
the
litigation.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
that's
correct.
not
obvious
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
the
suit
that
it
was
preempted
by
erisa
and
replaced
by
an
erisa
cause
of
action...
the
obviousness
of
the
test.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
no.
if
in
pilot
life,
your
honor,
you
decided
that
the
state
law
claims
were
preempted--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--this
case
would
still
not
be,
would
still
not
be
properly
removable
if
that
were
the
case.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
that
is
correct,
because
the
removal
determination,
the
determination
as
to
whether
a
federal
court
has
removal
jurisdiction,
has
to
be
made
and
has
to
speak
to
the
commencement
of
the
case.
subsequent
developments--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--yes.
it
would
govern
a
subsequent
case,
but
it
would
not
effect
our
case.
in
our
case--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--that
is
correct.
a
new
case
would
be
instantly
removable
under
the
obviousness
test
that
we
are,
that
we
are
propounding.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
that
would
be
exactly
like
avco
and
avco
is,
of
course,
an
example
of
the
obviousness
test.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
yes.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
there
was
a
circuit
conflict,
justice
scalia,
but
it
was
not
regarding
the
obviousness
of
preemption.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
in
avco
an
employer
brought
a
breach
of
contract
action
to
enforce
a
no
strike
provision
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
was
perfectly
clear
at
all
levels
of
litigation,
including
the
supreme
court,
that
based
on
this
court's
prior
decisions
that
was
a
preempted
claim
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
what
created
the
conflict
in
the
circuit
so
much
was
less
than
clear
before
the
case
reached
the
supreme
court
was
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act,
which
was
then
interpreted
as
barring
federal
court
injunctions
against
strike
activity,
nonetheless
divested
the
federal
court
of
jurisdiction.
but,
what
was
perfectly
clear--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--well
no,
the
preemption
issue
is,
i
see
it
as
conceptually
distinct.
on
the
preemption
issue
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
state
law
claim
was
preempted
under
section
301.
that
was
established.
what
was
unclear,
and
there
was
a
split
between
the
third
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
different
question
of
whether
or
not,
because
of
the
limitation
on
remedies,
the
federal
court
could
actually
take
the
case.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
and
the
obviousness
test
subscribed
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
in
our
case,
as
we
are
urging
here
is
one
that
focuses
on
preemption.
the
question
is,
is
preemption
obvious
at
the
time
the
law
suit
is
filed?
now
this
obviousness
test
derives
from
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine.
under
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine
a
plaintiff
has
the
power
of
choice.
he
can
choose
what
law
to
rely
on
and
by
means
of
that
choice
select
his
forum.
if
a
plaintiff
under
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine
has
available
to
him
a
federal
remedy
and
a
state
law
remedy
he
is
perfectly
free
to
forego
the
federal
remedy,
assert
only
the
state
law
remedy
and,
in
so
doing,
preclude
removal
of
his
case
from
federal
court.
now
this
power
of
choice
guaranteed
by
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine
is
subject
to
a
very
narrow
exception
and
the
narrow
exception
is
that
the
courts
will
not
honor
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
law
if
it
is
patently
unreasonable,
or
to
use
the
legal
term
of
art
in
removal
cases,
if
the
plaintiff
has
engaged
in
a
fraud
on
the
court,
or
has
engaged
'in
artful
pleading.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
because
the
plaintiff's
entitled
to
stay
in
state
court,
and
that
preemption
issue
will
get
to
this
court,
either
in
cases
filed
originally
in
federal
court,
or
in
cases
that
are
appealed
to
the
state
system
to
this
court
by
certiorari.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
it
has
to
be
obvious
at
the
time
it
was
filed.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
every
district
court
called
upon
to
make
a
removal
decision
would
look
to
see
whether
in
fact,
if
the
plaintiff
has
stated
on
the
face
of
this
complaint
simply
a
state
law
claim,
whether
that
state
law
claim
is
obviously
preempted,
and
if
this
court
has
already
addressed
the
issue,
then
clearly
it
has
been
obviously
preempted
for
purposes
of
that
xxx--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--well
that
is
correct,
but
the
decision,
i
think,
is
not
a
particularly
difficult
one
to
make.
i
mean,
after
all,
very
similar
kinds
of
determinations
have
to
be
made
under
the
substantiality
doctrine
every
day.
whenever
a
federal
claim
is
filed
initially
in
federal
court
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
in
fact
it's
a
substantial
federal
question.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
um-hum.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
reasonably
easy
inquiry
for
the
district
court
to
make.
the
law,
even
in
the
case
of
first
impression,
if
the
law
is
unambiguously
clear,
federal
law,
then
it
preempts
the
state
law
claim.
then
it's
obviously
preempted
and
the
case
goes
into
a
federal
court.
if
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
that
particular
issue
then
it's,
the
obviousness
test
is
not
satisfied.
if
there
are
substantial
arguments,
generally
speaking,
if
there
are
substantial
arguments
to
be
made
that
the
claim
is
not
preempted
by
federal
law,
then
the
obviousness
test
is
not
met
and
the
case
should
stay
in
state
court.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
um-hum.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
that...
certainly
the
petitioner's
in
this
case
would
have
the
benefit
of
that
ruling
in
pilot
life
by
moving
to
dismiss
in
state
court.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
oh
no,
that
claim
would
be
dismissed.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
that
claim
would
be
dismissed.
however,
once
the
case,
once
our
case
is
remanded
to
state
court
the
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
removal--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--mr.
taylor
can
then
proceed
against
petitioner,
general
motors,
for
his
separate
tort
claim
against
gm...
his
separate,
concededly
state
law,
claim.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
that
state
law
claim
was
decided
on
the
merits
by
the
federal
district
court
after
removal
in
this
case
under
the
mistaken
theory
that
it
was
a
section
5,
excuse
me,
on
a
pendent
jurisdiction--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--a
pendent
jurisdiction
theory.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
if
the
argument--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--as
i
understand
that
theory,
it
derives
from
what
has
sometimes
been
called
by
the
commentators
"protected
federal
jurisdiction".
and
the
first
thing
i
should
say
about
that
is
that
the
argument
was
not
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
below,
but
in
any
event,
should
the
court
reach
it
here.
when
congress
wants--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--it
was
not
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
below.
it
has
been
made
here
in
the
reply
belief
in
particular.
if
congress
wants
to
give
a
federal
district
court
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
jurisdictional
power
to
decide
a
purely
state
law
claim,
congress
has
to
be
absolutely
explicit
about
that.
congress
certainly
was
not
the
least
bit
explicit
about
it
in
erisa.
erisa
contains
no
clear
indication
in
its
language
or
in
its
statutory
history
that
purely
state
law
claims,
unpreempted
by
hypothesis
state
law
claims,
would
be
hauled
into
federal
court
and
decided
as
state
claims
by
a
federal
court
under
the
jurisdictional
provision
of
section
502.
furthermore,
if
that
theory
were
to
be
seriously
considered,
in
our
view
it
raises
some
difficult
article
iii
problems,
because
what
you're
hypothesizing
again
is
a
breach
of
contract
claim
against
an
insurance
company
purely
under
state
law
in
federal
court,
and
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
because
we're
assuming
that
the
state
law
claim
is
not
preempted,
erisa
doesn't
enter
into
the
picture
at
all.
there
are
no
federal
policies,
there
are
no
federal
issues,
there
are
no
federal
questions
implicated
by
the
litigation
and
that
really
stretches
this
protected
jurisdictional
theory
to
the
extreme
limits
in
our
view.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
uh-huh.
however,
erisa
expresses
no
such
federal
policy
is
the
essential
point.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
it
has
been
stated
here
again
and
again
this
morning
that
congress
intended
section
502
remedies
to
be
exclusive
and
that
any
state
law
claim
that
might
possibly
fall
within
their
sphere,
like
a
breach
of
contract
action
against
an
insurance
company,
is
simply
because
it
falls
within
the
scope
of
section
502
preempted.
it's
worthwhile,
i
think,
to
step
back
for
a
moment
and
consider
what
the,
what
is
essentially
at
stake
here.
there
has
been
talk
here
about
the
possibility
of
remedies
under
state
law,
punitive
damages,
extra
contractual
relief
and
so
forth
that
would
be
excessive,
harmful
to
the
insurance
industry.
there
have
been
arguments
about
disuniformity
created
by
state
tort
systems
and
state
breach
of
contract
claims
co-existing
with
remedies
under
section
502.
but
the
real,
what
is
really
at
issue
here
is
that
under
section
502
a
claim
for
benefits
is
subject
to
the
highly
deferential,
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
that
is
a
standard
review
in
federal
court
in
a
502
action
by
a
claimant
for
benefits,
including
a
claim
for
breach
of
the
insurance
policy.
now
it's
perfectly
understandable
why
the
insurance
industry
feels
so
strongly
about
section
502
exclusivity.
they
want
full
benefit
of
that
deferential,
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
in
every
case.
but
congress
had
good
reason
not
to
make
that
section
502
remedy
and
the
deferential
standard
that
goes
with
it
exclusively
applicable
precluding
state
remedies
in
cases
against
insurance
companies.
and
it's
simply
this,
insurance
companies
are
interested
parties.
it
may
be
one
thing
for
congress
to
make
502
remedies
exclusively
for
suing
a
neutral
trustee,
or
a
neutral
plan
administrator,
but
when
you're
suing
an
insurance
company,
the
insurance
company
is
a
contracting
party.
if
you're
suing
an
insurance
company
for
breach
of
contract
does
it
make
any
sense
to
defer
to
one
party
of
a
two
party
contract
and
its
interpretation
of
the
contract
language?
i
think
it
does
not
and
that
is
why
congress
meant
to
permit
de
novo
judicial
review
under
state
breach
of
contract
principles
of
the
meaning
and
interpretation
of
an
insurance
policy.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
a
company
that
is
self-insured
is
a
somewhat
interested
party,
but
xxx--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--no,
i
would
disagree,
justice
scalia.
i
mean,
when
a
company
is
self-insured
it
is
concerned
about
continuing
good
relations
with
its
employees.
when
a
company
is
self-insured
its
plan
very
frequently
is
a
result
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
arm's
length
negotiation
between
a
union
and
the
company.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
i
think
it
is
a
party
that
is
certainly
less
directly
interested
in
the
outcome
of
a
particular
benefit
claim
case
than
is
an
insurance
company.
in
the
insurance
context,
by
and
large
every
dollar
of
benefits
one
gets
in
the
insurance
company
reduces
the
insurer's
profits
on
that
plan
by
that
amount.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
mr.
chief
justice,
that
argument
can
cut
the
other
way
too.
if
it's
interested
in
maintaining
gm's
business
what
it
would
like
to
do
is
keep
its
premiums
as
low
as
possible
to
gm.
to
keep
its
premiums
as
low
as
possible
to
gm
could
be
very
difficult
with
claimants
for
benefits.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
gm
xxx--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--in
section
502
of
erisa
congress
intended
to
provide
minimum
remedies.
it
did
not
intend
to
provide
all-inclusive
remedies
to
regulate,
to
legislative
comprehensively
in
the
field
so
far
as
claims
against
insurance
companies
are
concerned.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
obviously
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
to
deprive
a
policyholder
of
the
pre-existing
body
of
state
law
protections
simply
because
that
policy
holder
was
a
participant
in
erisa
plan.
conversely,
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
to
immunize
insurance
companies
from
the
vast
body
of
pre-existing
state
insurance
regulation
simply
because
the
insurance
company
was
insuring
an
erisa-regulated
plan.
what
502
does
is
simply
provide
additional
supplemental
remedies,
remedies
that
supplement
the
state
law.
congress,
when
it
was
enacting
erisa,
had
had
no
experience
whatever
in
regulating
insurance.
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
that
had
been
the
exclusive
domain
of
the
states
for
many
decades.
what
congress
wanted
to
do
here
was
to
defer
to
that
expertise,
to
leave
those
state
remedies
intact,
and
at
the
same
time
provide
section
502
remedies
which
would
be
minimal
remedies,
advantageous
in
many
instances
particularly
for
small
claims,
but
would
not
be
exclusive,
would
not
be
the
only
remedies
available.
if
one
had
a
remedy
under
state
law,
one
could
pursue
a
remedy
under
state
law.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
i'm
not
quite
sure
i'm
following
the
question.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
that
may
be
in
some
circumstances.
it
may
not
be
in
others.
the
venue
provisions
of
erisa
are
quite
generous
and
erisa
does
provide
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
which
state
law
ordinarily
does
not.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
all
i
mean
to
say
is
that
in
certain
respects
a
section
502
claim
is
advantageous
to
a
state
law
claim.
it
does
provide
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
that's
generally
not
available
in
state
court.
it
does
waive
jurisdictional
amount
requirements
which
might
apply
in
some
state
courts.
and
for
small
claimants
suing
insurance
companies,
it
makes
sense
frequently
to
use
section
502.
but
it
makes
no
sense
to
think
that
congress
wanted
to
preclude
de
novo
judicial
review
under
state
breach
of
contract
law
of
the
meaning
of
a
clause
of
an
insurance
policy
drafted
by
an
insurer,
and
to
force
plaintiffs
to
go
to
federal
court
and
to
have
that
issue
subjected
to
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
attack.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
it
is
my
understanding
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
not
necessarily
the
plans
covering
the
vast
majority
of
employees
who
are
subject
to
erisa,
but
in
the
vast
majority
of
individual
plans
the
insurance
company
has
a
policy
and
it
drafts
the
policy
and
it
sells
it
to
the
employer.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
well
you
have
some
built-in
protection,
but
i
should
also
point
out
that
erisa
permits
a
fiduciary
to
delegate
his
fiduciary
responsibility
to
an
insurance
company.
and
in
the
vast
majority
of
these
small
erisa
plans
it
is
my
understanding,
simply
having
talked
to
lawyers
who
practice
erisa
full-time,
that
that
delegation
takes
place
such
that
the
only
party
you
can
sue
under
section
502
is
the
insurance
company.
you
don't
have
available
to
you
the
opportunity
to
sue
someone
who
might
be
more
neutral...
a
trustee,
a
plant
administrator,
xxx--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--obviously
market
forces,
you
know,
are
at
work
and
if
an
insurance
company,
at
some
point
an
insurance
company's
intransigence
in
dealing
with
claimants
with
bona
fide
claims
would
certainly,
one
could
see
that
it
would
be
to
termination
of
that
relationship.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
but
the
mere
fact
that,
you
know,
the
marketplace
is
at
work
doesn't--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--that
i
don't
know.
the
record
does
not
make
that
clear.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
well,
i
think
again,
i'm
not
sure
that
congress
first
of
all
necessarily
focused
on
all
of
the
possible
permutations
of
plan
arrangements
that
might
exist
under
erisa.
but
one
category
that
was
certainly
on
their
minds
because
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
was
the
insurance
industry.
and
in
the
insurance
industry
i
think
congress
could
well
understand
that
it
would
be
dangerous
and
perhaps
reckless
to
restrict
claimants
under
section
502
for
benefits
for
breach
of
a
contract
to
the
determination
of
the
insurer
subject
only
to
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
of
review.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
no,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
not
correct
in
this
case.
all
of
the
benefits
here
are
insured
by
the
insurance
company
save
one,
according
to
petitioners,
and
that
is
the
separate
claim
regarding
salary
continuation
benefits.
they
say
that
because
that
is
not
an
insured
plan
the
savings
clause
for
insurance
does
not
apply.
the
short
answer
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
argument
was
not
made
below
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
so
it
should
not
be
made
here.
a
somewhat
longer
answer,
a
different
answer
is
if
the
court
wishes
to
consider
what
matters
there
is
that
the
claim
was
nonetheless
made
against
an
insurance
company.
whether
or
not
the
insurance
company
had
the
power
to
pay
the
benefit
that
was
sought
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
contract
claim.
but
the
fact
is
that
it
was
a
claim
against
the
insurance
company
and
to
that
extent
was
fully
subject
to
the
erisa
savings
clause.
now,
there's
been
reference
again
and
again
under
the
savings
clause
to
this
alleged
distinction
between
laws
of
general
applicability
and
laws
or
statutes
or
regulations
of
a
state
that
are
more
specifically
focused
on
the
insurance
industry.
the
distinction
cannot
withstand
scrutiny
under
erisa
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
statute.
erisa
defines
state
law
for
purposes
of
the
savings
clause,
as
well
as
the
basic
preemption
provisions,
to
include
decisions,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
been
absolutely
uniform
in
interpreting
the
word,
"decisions"
to
mean
common
law
actions
for
breach
of
contract,
for
tort
and
the
like.
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
justice
scalia,
the
distinction
really
escapes
me.
i
mean,
if
it's
the
law
of
any
state
or--
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
--but
what
is
the
difference
between
"state
laws"
and
a
"law
of
any
state"?
mr.
peter
edward
scheer
but,
if
i
sit
here
and
try
to
imagine
what
the
difference
might
be,
i
simply
can't
come
up
with
any
explanation.
