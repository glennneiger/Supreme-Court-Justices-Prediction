justice

we're
those
cases
that
say
that
the
so-called
301
actions
aren't...
don't
completely
preempt
the
state
causes
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
way
you
put
it,
the
argument
is
that
state
law
is
not
put
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
that
preemption
is
much
more
stricter
and
more
obvious
here
than
in
the
301
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
any
action
trying
to
collect
a
claim
is
a
federal
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--can't
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
from
your
position
that
couldn't
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
really
saying
the
well-pleaded
contempt,
complaint
rule
just
doesn't
apply
when
on
its
face
the
state
claim
is
frivolous.
i
mean,
it's
frivolous
to
claim
that
it's
a
state
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
your
case
are
you...
if
case
just
argued,
if
pilot
life
is
decided
against
preemption,
will
your
case
be
more
difficult?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
that's
in,
but
then,
but
otherwise,
otherwise--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
have
a
tough
case
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
lot
of
the
focus
in
pilot
life
is
on
the
remedies
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
just
like
avco
in
the
labor--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
so,
there
would
be...
would
this
case
have
been
properly
removable
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
with
preemption,
no
removal?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it
might
be
removable
the
day
after
pilot
life
is...
if
pilot
life
were
decided
against
preemption,
or
decided
in
favor
of
preemption.
a
case
like--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
even
if
it
were
filed
later?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
but
i
mean,
let's
assume
pilot
life
is
decided
and
it
is
decided
that
remedies
are
preempted
and
then
a
case
is
filed
like
yours.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
no,
not
yours,
but
a
new
case
would
be
affected?
it
would
be
removable
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
like
avco
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
we
decide
in
pilot
life
that
there,
that
the
remedies
are
preempted.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
then
all
the
defendant
does,
in
your
case
has
to
do
is
move
to
dismiss?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it's
great
to
have
it
back
in
state,
great
to
have
it
back
in
state
court
just
so
it
can
be
dismissed
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
pendent
jurisdiction.
