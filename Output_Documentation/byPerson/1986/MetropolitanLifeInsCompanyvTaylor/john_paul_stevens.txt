mr.
scheer,
are
these
clauses
typically
drafted
by
the
insurance
companies,
or
are
they
typically
the
product
of
a
union
management
negotiation
as
to
just
what
the
benefits
will
be
and
the
conditions
of
eligibility
and
all
the
rest?
isn't
there
a
group
interest
rather
than
an
individual
claimant
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
the
entire
work
force,
of
course,
for
everybody
employed
by
that
company.
it
isn't
the
situation
where
you
have
one
individual
who
has
to
look
to
a
state
agency
for
protection
if
he
feels
he's
unfairly
dealt
with
or
sue.
he
at
least
has
the
interest
of
the
company
and
the
union
in
being
sure
they
want
to
continue
to
do
business
with
this
particular
insurer.
so
you
do
have
some
built
in
protections
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
insurance
company
habitually
was
slow
paying
because
it
wanted
to,
you
know,
get
the
use
of
the
money
and
so
forth,
do
you
suppose
it
would
keep
the
business
very
long?
in
these
cases,
it
isn't
quite
the
same
situation
where
you
on
the
open
market
with
individual
policy
holders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
we
started
with
was
the
question
of
the
drafting
of
the...
in
this
particular
case,
was
the
general
motors'
plan
drafted
by
metropolitan
or
was
it
drafted
by
the
company
and
the
union?
