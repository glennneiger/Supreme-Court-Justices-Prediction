mr.
david
m.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
claim
filed
in
state
court
for
disability
benefits
under
an
erisa-covered
welfare
plan
is
a
claim
rising
under
federal
law
by
either
federal
preemption
or
falls
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
by
reason
of
an
express
grant
of
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
statute
so
that
it
may
properly
be
removed
to
the
federal
court.
general
motors
corporation
provides
disability
benefits
to
its
employees
under
the
general
motors
insurance
program.
general
motors
corporation
is
the
plan
administrator.
the
named
fiduciary
is
the
finance
committee
of
the
general
motors
board
of
directors.
disabled
employees
can
receive
sickness
and
accident
benefits
providing
75
percent
of
normal
compensation
for
up
to
52
weeks.
the
benefit
is
provided
through
metropolitan
life
insurance
company.
in
addition,
general
motors
provides
an
additional
benefit
called
salary
continuation
benefit,
equal
to
25
percent
of
normal
compensation
for
up
to
26
weeks.
the
salary
continuation
benefit
is
provided
solely
by
general
motors,
is
not
insured
and
is
self-funded.
mr.
taylor
commenced
a
sick
leave
of
absence
in
1980.
during
his
sick
leave
and
through
july
of
1980
he
received
both
sickness
and
accident
benefits
and
salary
continuation
benefits.
benefits
ceased
upon
a
determination
that
mr.
taylor
was
no
longer
disabled.
mr.
taylor
was
advised
to
report
to
the
general
motors
medical
department
and
there
advised
that
he
was
capable
of
returning
to
employment.
his
continued
absence
from
employment
caused
his
termination
of
employment.
thereafter
he
filed
a
lawsuit
against
both
general
motors
and
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
seeking
the
immediate
re-implementation
of
all
benefits.
the
complaint
referred
specifically
to
sickness
and
accident
benefits
provided
by
metropolitan
and
salary
continuation
benefits
provided
by
general
motors.
in
addition,
the
plaintiff
sought
extra
contractual
damages.
the
action
was
removed
by
general
motors
corporation
to
the
federal
district
court
based
on
a
claim
that
the
claim
arose
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and
that
any
claim
for
benefits
had
to
arise
under
federal
law.
in
1981,
the
district
court
considered
a
motion
to
remand
filed
by
the
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
at
that
time
conceded
that
he
sought
disability
salary
continuation
benefits
directly
from
general
motors
and
his
motion
to
remand
was
denied.
thereafter
a
summary
judgment
was
granted
in
favor
of
the
defendants.
the
sixth
circuit,
upon
consideration
of
the
case,
found
no
federal
jurisdiction.
they
found
that
based
on
three
reasons.
they
refused,
despite
the
statutory
and
legislative
history,
they
refused
to
consider
the
claims
under
erisa
were
to
be
treated
in
similar
fashion
as
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
as
those
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
they
further
felt
that
the
plaintiff
had
limited
his
complaint
to
state
law
principles
and
thus
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
precluded
removal.
and
lastly,
they
interpreted
general
motors'
reference
to
erisa
as
raising
only
a
defense
under
federal
law
and
thus
interpreted
the
franchise
tax
board
decision
of
this
court
as
precluding
removal.
because
taylor's
suit
necessarily
arises
under
federal
law
and
because
it's
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
it
is
properly
removable.
the
federal
removal
statute
applies
to
claims
within
the
jurisdiction,
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and
also
to
claims
arising
under
federal
law.
erisa,
at
section
502,
authorizes
a
participant
to
commence
a
civil
action
to
recover
benefits
due
him
under
the
plan,
to
enforce
his
rights
under
the
plan,
or
to
clarify
his
rights
to
future
benefits
under
the
plan.
erisa
at
502(e)
and
(f)
specifically
provide
that
such
claims
seeking
benefit
entitlement
are
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
regardless
of
citizenship
of
the
parties,
and
regardless
of
the
amount
in
controversy.
mr.
david
m.
davis
okay,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
under
502
congress,
in
the
legislative
history,
specifically
advised
that
claims
seeking
benefit
entitlement
were
to
be
considered
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
federal,
of
the
united
states
in
similar
fashion
to
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
and
that
reference
is
extremely
important.
mr.
david
m.
davis
okay.
and
that's
why
the
reference
to
301
is
extremely
important.
this
court
has
indicated
that
a
claim
based
on
a
collectively-bargained
agreement
under
section
301,
although
the
plaintiff
attempts
to
rely
on
state
law
remedies,
or
state
law
breach
of
contract
principles,
that
claim
necessarily
arises
under
federal
law.
in
avco,
this
court
indicated
that
301
actions,
and
congress
intended
erisa
to
be
treated
the
same,
are
controlled
by
federal
substantive
law
that
arise
under
the
united
states,
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
franchise
tax
board
again,
this
court
considered
that
premise
and
indicated
that
avco
stood
for
the
proposition
that
if
a
federal
cause
of
action
completely
preempts
a
state
cause
of
action
any
complaint
coming
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
action,
although
attempting
to
rely
on
state
law,
necessarily
arises
under
the
federal
law.
indeed,
in
the
franchise
tax
board
decision,
this
court
commented
on
the
specific
remedies
under
section
502
of
erisa
and
indicated
that
it
may
well
be
if
a
complaint
attempting
to
rely
on
state
law
comes
within
the
bounds
of
section
502
and
the
remedies
enumerated
therein,
then
the
case
necessarily
arises
under
federal
law.
and--
mr.
david
m.
davis
--and
probably
the
issue
in
those
cases
are
whether
the
action
is
peripheral,
far
enough
apart,
tangential
to
the
labor
agreement.
mr.
david
m.
davis
one
difference
between
the
labor
management
relations
act
is
that
statute
didn't
include
a
comprehensive
remedial
scheme
such
as
erisa,
so
the
courts
have
fashioned
federal
remedies
under
section
301.
it
didn't
have
express
remedies
in
the
federal
statute.
and
it
didn't
have
express
federal
preemption
in
the
statute.
erisa
has
both
of
those.
it
has
a
private
member
in
the
statute--
mr.
david
m.
davis
--that's
right.
that
would
be
my
position.
it's
clear
that
congress,
in
enacting
erisa
remedies
in
section
502,
and
claims
procedures
in
section
503,
intended
that
those
provisions
be
exclusive
and
preempt
state
law.
this
can
be
demonstrated
by
the
statutory
language
of
erisa
as
well
as
the
legislative
history
under
erisa.
congress
recognized
that
federal
governance
of
a
growing
body
of
employee
benefit
plans
that
implicated
as
participants
the
vast
majority
of
citizens
of
this
country,
they
declared
the
policy
to
be
to
protect
participants
by
establishing
standards
of
conduct,
responsibility
and
obligations
for
fiduciaries
of
employee
benefit
plans,
and
by
providing
appropriate
remedies,
sanctions
and
ready
access
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
david
m.
davis
yes.
mr.
david
m.
davis
yes,
it
does.
it
means
that
the...
the
argument
in
the
last
case
focused
on
section
514.
i'm
focusing
more
so
on
section
503
and
502
as
an
express
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
m.
davis
that's
right.
i
would
refer
to
the
merrill
dodd
decision
v.
thompson,
recently
decided
by
this
court,
where
you
considered
whether
a
private
remedy
existed
in
a
federal
statute.
that
was
a
5-4
split,
the
majority
rejecting
removal
because
of
the
absence
of
a
federal
remedy
in
the
statute.
the
dissent
nevertheless
explained
the
rationale
of
the
court
in
advising
if
the
fdca
had
a
federal
remedy
in
it,
then
removal
would
have
been
proper
even
if
the
plaintiff--
mr.
david
m.
davis
--i
understand.
but
in
this
particular
case
the
dissent
was
summarized
in
the
majority.
and,
the
majority
stated
the
importance
of
a
federal
private
remedy
in
reaching
its
decision.
in
erisa
we
have
that
private
federal
remedy.
so
i
think
congress
clearly
intended
to
regulate
the
remedies
under
erisa
and
preclude
states
from
doing
the
same.
and
it's
evident
by
502,
and
it's
evident
by
the
congressional
history
under
502.
mr.
david
m.
davis
that's
right.
that's
my
position.
mr.
david
m.
davis
i
would
argue
no
matter
how
the
complaint
was
written,
if
it
was
one
seeking
benefits
under
the
plan
then
it
arises
under
the
federal
law
and
it's
a
federal
claim.
mr.
david
m.
davis
if
it
doesn't
arise
under
federal
law,
i
would
acknowledge
that.
mr.
david
m.
davis
but,
i
think
congress
intended
specifically--
mr.
david
m.
davis
--what
it
indicated--
mr.
david
m.
davis
--well,
i
think
any
claim
for
benefits
under
an
erisa
plan
must
arise
under
federal
law.
mr.
david
m.
davis
if
you
want
me
to
assume
that
that
premise
is
incorrect
then,
yeah,
it's
disagreement
with
my
argument.
mr.
david
m.
davis
i
think
congress
clearly
stated
that
when
they
said
these
claims
are
similar
to
the
labor
relations
law.
and
the
rationale
for
that
was
very
simple.
at
general
motors
the
salaried,
non-represented
plan
is
virtually
identical
to
a
collectively
bargained,
hourly
plan.
i
think
congress
recognized
that
and
didn't
want
to
have--
mr.
david
m.
davis
--that's
right.
i
think
it
doesn't
apply
when
the
law
is
such
that
the
state
claims
have
been
preempted
and
been
replaced
by
federal
remedies.
i
think
this
court
recognized
that
in
franchise
tax
court
and
in
avco,
and
the
same
situation
exists
here.
when
that
happens,
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
doesn't
preclude
the
court
from
looking
behind
the
complaint
to
determine
the
true
character
of
the
cause
of
action.
in
this
case,
it's
a
federal
cause
of
action.
i
think
also
that
is
very
clear
from
the
legislative
history
under
erisa.
in
reviewing
the
legislative
history
it's
apparent
senator
harrison
williams
stressed
that
the
substantive
and
enforcement
provisions
of
erisa
are
intended
to
preempt
the
field
for
federal
regulation,
thus
eliminating
the
threat
of
conflicting
and
inconsistent
state
and
local
regulation
of
employee
benefit
plans.
congressman
john
dent
made
note
of
what
to
many
is
the
crowning
achievement
of
the
legislation,
the
reservations
of
federal
authority
of
the
sole
power
to
regulate
the
field
of
employee
benefit
plans.
again,
the
conference
committee
referred
to
actions
for
claims
under
section
502
as
arising
in
federal
or
state
courts,
or
to
regarded
as
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
similar
fashion
to
labor
laws.
senator
javits,
one
of
the
two
principal
senate
sponsors,
in
presenting
the
conference
committee
report
indicated
that
it
was
also
intended
that
a
federal
substantive
law
be
developed
by
the
courts
to
deal
with
issues
involving
rights
and
obligations
under
private
welfare
and
pension
plans.
allowing
the
plaintiff
to
pursue
state
remedies
would
undercut
these
congressional
goals.
these
goals
were
recognized
by
this
court
in
alessi
v.
raybestos-manhattan
and
shaw
v.
delta
airlines
where
state
statutes
were
held
preempted
and
the
benefit
plan
regulation
was
declared
to
be
an
area
of
exclusively
federal
concern.
this
court
noted
that
congress
minimized
the
need
for
interstate
employers
to
administer
their
plans
differently
in
each
state
in
which
they
have
employees.
and
participants,
if
state
remedies
survive,
will
be
able
to
avoid
the
carefully
designed
claims
procedures
mandated
by
erisa
for
all
plans,
both
insured
and
self-insured.
this
court,
in
allis
chalmers
v.
lueck,
held
that
a
state
tort
claim
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
good
faith
was
preempted
by
federal
labor
law.
importantly,
this
court
noted
that
the
most
harmful
aspect
of
the
wisconsin
decision
rejecting
preemption
was
that
it
would
allow
essentially
the
same
suit
to
be
brought
in
state
court
without
first
exhausting
the
grievance
procedures
established
in
the
bargaining
agreement.
that
same
undesirable
result
would
be
here
as
well
if
the
plaintiffs
were
allowed
to
avoid
these
federal
remedies
and
federal
claims
procedures
and
proceed
directly
to
state
court
under
state
claims.
additionally,
exhausting
of
the
state
remedies
of
the
claims
procedures
and
the
remedies
in
erisa
would
have
the
tendency
of
providing
the
participant
with
a
reasoned
knowledge
of
why
his
claim
was
denied
and
would
have
a
tendency
to
reduce
litigation
rather
than
encourage
it.
the
claims
procedures
and
remedies
set
forth
in
erisa
would
be
rendered
ineffectual
for
the
vast
majority
of
plans
if
plaintiffs
were
allowed
to
pursue
state
remedies.
as
the
solicitor
general
noted...
and,
justice
o'connor,
the
figures
you
cited
were
correct...
i
would
say
about
90
percent
of
the
welfare
plans
are
insured
and
administered
by
insurance
companies.
allowing
different
remedies
for
insured
versus
self-insured
plans
would
act
to
lessen
the
protection
for
participants
because
employers
would
tend
to
move
toward
self-insured
plans.
not
surprising
that
the
united
states
in
its
amicus
brief
filed
in
pilot
life,
the
case
preceding,
noted
that
congress
intends
the
remedies
provided
under
section
502
to
be
exclusive.
the
government
recognized
that
congress
had
established
a
detailed
enforcement
scheme,
that
congress
made
clear
that
federal
law
applies
and
that
federal
common
law
was
to
be
developed,
that
congress
declared
that
all
actions
arise
in
similar
fashion
as
those
under
the
labor
law,
and,
further,
that
the
legislative
history
under
502
failed
to
mention,
or
even
contemplate,
that
participants
could
pursue
alternative
state
remedies.
the
government
felt
that
was
important
because
had
such
been
the
intent
it
surely
would
have
been
mentioned.
congress
enacted
section
514
as
an
express
preemption
of
state
law.
no
doubt
section
514
supersedes
any
and
all
state
laws
that
may
relate
to
an
employee
benefit
plan.
and
further,
section
514
provided
for
an
insurance
savings
clause
preserving
the
state's
ability
to
regulate
the
business
of
insurance.
nevertheless,
the
deemer
clause
limited
the
exception
so
that
state
laws
would
not
be
applied
directly
to
the
plans,
not
be
applied
directly
in
areas
where
erisa
comprehensively
regulated
the
plans.
the
metropolitan
v.
massachusetts
case
is
not
to
the
contrary.
in
that
particular
case
a
massachusetts-mandated
benefit
law
survived
preemption.
that
was
an
area
under
erisa
that
was
not
regulated.
erisa
does
not
regulate
the
content
of
a
welfare
benefit
plan.
that
was
a...
that
was
a
result
that
did
not
provide
direct
regulation
of
the
plan;
it
only
provided
regulation
of
an
insurance
company
in
the
type
of
policy
they
could
sell
to
a
plan.
in
this
case,
erisa
comprehensively
regulates
remedies
available
to
participants.
erisa
comprehensively,
if
state
remedies
survive
that
would
be
state
law
acting
directly
on
the
plan,
not
on
any
insurance
company,
directly
on
the
plan
and
its
claims
processing
procedure.
that
result
was
far
different
than
that
in
the
metropolitan
case.
lastly,
taylor's
complaint
contains
a
claim
for
an
uninsured
or
self-insured
benefit,
that
being
the
salary
continuation
benefit.
that's
a
benefit
that's
not
governed
at
all,
no
relevance
to
the
insurance
savings
clause
under
section
514,
clearly
a
benefit
that's
self-insured
and
self-funded,
independent.
that
claim
alone
would
support
removal
and
along
with
the
removal
of
that
claim
would
come
the
rest
of
the
complaint.
in
summary,
allowing
participants
to
pursue
state
remedies
in
seeking
entitlement
to
benefits
under
erisa
would
be
contrary
to
congressional
intent
to
have
benefit
plan
regulation
to
be
a
matter
of
exclusive
federal
concern,
to
encourage
the
continued
growth
of
such
plans
by
protecting
plans
and
plan
administrators
from
inconsistent
and
varying
state
regulations.
mr.
david
m.
davis
if
pilot
life
is
decided
against
preemption,
i
contend
in
this
case
the
case
was
properly
removable,
or
removed
because
of
the
claim
for
the
uninsured
benefit.
mr.
david
m.
davis
otherwise--
mr.
david
m.
davis
--well
otherwise,
you
know,
i'm
putting
more
focus
on
the
remedies.
i'm
not
talking
about
section
514.
mr.
david
m.
davis
well,
i
think
additionally,
even
if
there's
no
preemption,
i
think
there
was
an
express
federal
grant
that
comes
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
i
think
the
case
would
be
removable
whether
or
not
there
was
preemption.
congress--
mr.
david
m.
davis
--it
would
be
removable.
you
asked
me
whether
the
claim
would
arise
under
federal
law,
assume
that
it
doesn't
arise
under
federal
law.
i
think--
mr.
david
m.
davis
--i
think
it
would
be,
it
may
be
a
state
cause
of
action
where
congress
ordained
and
granted
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
under
502
to
consider
the
state
claims,
maybe
under
the
premise
of
protective
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
m.
davis
and,
i
think
that,
i
think
even
if
it
was
recognized
as
a
state
law
claim--
mr.
david
m.
davis
--no,
i'm
not.
allowing
participants
to
pursue
state
remedies
would
retard
and
preclude
the
development
of
a
uniform
body
of
federal
law
intended
by
congress.
any
distinction
in
remedies
available
under
insured
versus
self-insured
plans
would
lessen
the
protection
to
participants
by
encouraging
employers
to
establish
self-funded
or
self-insured
plans
so
as
not
to
be
subject
to
the
varying
state
regulation.
this
would
be
contrary
to
the
goals
of
congress
in
enacting
erisa.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
david
m.
davis
briefly,
if
we
talk
or
focus
on
the
obviousness
test,
in
the
avco
case
the
issue
was
whether
a
state
injunctive
remedy
was
preempted
by
federal
law.
that
was
not
clear
and
obvious.
there
was
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
that
issue.
this
court
granted
jurisdiction,
or
took
the
case
to
resolve
the
conflict.
an
obviousness
test
would
preclude
the
development
of
any
uniformity
development
of
the
law.
under
erisa
it
is
important
that
it
was
intended
by
congress
that
the
body
of
the
uniform
law
be
developed.
any
obviousness
test
precluding
removal
would
retard
that.
further,
this
court
has
recently
in
the
merrill
dow
case
indicated
a
preference
to
have
federal
courts
decide
issues
of
federal
law.
in
answer
to
the
question
of
how
the
general
motors'
plan
came
into
existence,
general
motors
and
its
labor
unions
negotiated
a
plan
for
hourly
employees.
the
salaried
plan
is
fashioned
from
the
hourly
plan.
it's
a
result
of
general
motors
adopting
the
plans
that
were
negotiated
and
conferring
with
insurance
companies
to
provide
the
benefits.
lastly,
general
motors
did
make
an
argument
to
the
sixth
circuit
on
page
21
of
its
opening
brief
that
502
alone
provided
sufficient
language
and
granted
the
federal
courts
original
jurisdiction
separate
and
apart
from
preemption.
thank
you,
your
honors.
