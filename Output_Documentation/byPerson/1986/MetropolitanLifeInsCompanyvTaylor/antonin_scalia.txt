justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
would
argue
that
there
was
original
jurisdiction
even
if
there
wasn't
a
federal
claim
and
it
was
just
a
state
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
doesn't
arise
under
federal
law?
you
acknowledge
that
if
it
doesn't
arise
under
federal
law
there's
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
asked
you
that
before
and
you
said
no.
my
earlier
question
was
referring
to
part,
the
portion
of
your
brief
beginning
on
page
43
where
you
say
even
if
this
is
a
valid
state
cause
of
action
and
not
a
federal
cause
of
action
it
would
still
be
removable.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
state
cause
of
action
that
arises
under
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
abandoning
that
portion?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
was
it
obvious
in
avco?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
time
we
made
our
decision
i
thought
there
was
a
circuit
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
preemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
whenever
we
have
a
removal
case
such
as
this,
where
the
issue
comes
up,
the
case
comes
all
the
way
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
really
the
only
thing
we
can
determine
is
whether
it
is
obvious
that
there
was
preemption
and
we
shouldn't
get
any
further
because
that's
as
far
as
we
have
to
go.
if
it
was
not
obvious,
even
though
there
is
preemption,
we
have
to
say,
well,
that's
for
the
next
case...
right...
and
we
send
it
back
down
and
it
goes
back
to
state
court
and
the
state
court
finds,
yes,
there
is
preemption,
and
then
it
comes
up
to
us
on
cert
and
then
we
can
say,
yes,
there
is
preemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
really
strange
way
to
run
a
system,
don't
you
think?
why
can't
we
say
the
first
time
whether
it
is
or
is
not
preemption?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
all
we
can
answer
now
is
whether
it's
obvious
or
not
that
there's
preemption,
right?
and
we
can
presumably
write
an
opinion
that
says,
well,
there
is
preemption,
but
it's
not
obvious.
it's
hard
to
write
in
opinion
that
decides
whether
it's
obvious
that
there
is
preemption
without
getting
into
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
preemption,
isn't
there?
and
by
the
time
we
have
written
that
opinion
and
it
goes
back
down
to
state
court,
i
guess
the
state
court
would
know
pretty
well
what
to
do.
but
it
has
to
have
been
obvious
at
the
time
it
was
filed,
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
scheer,
it
really
is
a
very
unproductive
enterprise
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
litigating
over
jurisdiction.
let's
assume
that
there's
no
preemption.
the
petitioner
says
that
even
if
there
isn't
any
preemption
the
district
court
still
has
jurisdiction,
even
if
this
is
a
state
claim,
because
congress,
realizing
that
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
litigating
over
jurisdiction,
provided
that
what
is
removable
is,
the
district
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
relief
provided
for
in
sub-section
(a)
of
this
section
in
any
action.
and
the
relief
provided
for
is
relief
to
recover
benefits
due
to
a
participant
or
beneficiary
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
whether
that
relief,
the
petitioner
says,
is
under
state
law
or
federal
law
isn't
specified
in
that
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
isn't
that
a
lovely
way
to
handle
it?
even
it
is
a
state
claim,
you
bring
it
in
federal
court
and
whether
you
want
to
attach
it
to
the
federal
claim
or
not,
and
then
you
never
have
to
worry
about
where
to
litigate
the
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not
made
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal
policy
would
be
lets
get
rid
of
it
all
together.
do
them
all
in
one
piece
of
litigation
and
save
people
the
money
of
deciding
where
you
have
to
litigate?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
any
different
when
the
company
is
a
self-insured?
isn't
the
company
then
an
interested
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
much,
just
as
much
as
the
insurance
company.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean
there
may
be
some
differences
but
don't
tell
me
that
it's
not
a
self-interested
party
that
you're
allowing
to
adjudicate
the
rights
under
this
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
the
congress
want
to
save
these
important
state
rights
only
in
the
case
of
insurance
companies
and
not
where
you
have
a
self-insurer?
justice
antonin
scalia
not,
of
course,
define
law
of
any
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
term,
you
define
a
term.
and
the
term
is
not
"state
laws"
but
"the
law
of
any
state".
there
may
well
have
been
an
intent
to
convey
a
different
meaning
by
the
use
of
one
phrase
rather
than
the
other.
you
define
the
term
"state
laws",
whenever
you
use
the
word
"state
laws",
that's
what
you
mean.
they
didn't
use
"state
law"
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
basic
distinction
is
that
the
phrase
"law
of
any
state"
is
not
defined.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
any
difference
except
that
it's
not
defined.
much
has
been
made
in
the
briefs
of
petitioners
about
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
they
refer
to
the
three
criteria
that
have
been
set
up
by
this
court
to
decide
in
certain
instances
whether
certain
kinds
of
private
activity
are
subject
to
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
those
three
criteria,
spreading
of
the
risk,
whether
or
not
the
matter
governs
the
relationship
between
the
insured
and
the
insurance
company
and
whether
or
not
the
arrangement
involves
only
entities
within
the
insurance
industry
are
not
at
all
relevant
to
this
case.
those
three
criteria
that
were
used
in
the
metropolitan
life
decision,
are
relied
on
there,
are
designed
solely
to
decide
whether
economic
arrangements
ancillary
to
actual
insurance
are
subject
to
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
those
three
criteria
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
core
of
insurance
regulation.
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
covers
many
more
things
than
state
laws
and
regulations
that
meet
those
three
criteria.
and
at
the
very
core
of
what
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
does
protect
in
its
policies
is
the
enforcement
of
contracts
for
insurance
between
policy
holders
and
insurance
companies,
the
interpretation
of
those
policies
and
precisely
the
matters
that
we
are
pursuing
here.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
mr.
scheer.
mr.
davis,
do
you
have
something
more?
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
