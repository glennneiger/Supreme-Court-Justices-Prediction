chief

rehnquist
mr.
davis,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
all
of
that
is
probably
conceded,
mr.
davis,
and
what
the
fight
here
about
is
the
conflict
between
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine
and
the
rules
that
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
the
plaintiff
has
said
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
yes,
i'm
pleading
this
case.
perhaps
i
could
have
brought
it
under
federal
law,
but
i'm
bringing
it
under
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
davis,
you
heard
the
last
case
argued,
did
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
in
deciding
that
case
this
court
were
to
decide
either
5-to-4
that
it
was
preempted,
or
5-to-4
that
it
wasn't
preempted;
does
that
mean
that
the
defendant
in
the
last
case,
had
it
been
brought
in
state
court,
could
have
removed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
no
matter
how
debateable
the
preemption
point
may
be,
if
it
ultimately
turns
out
to
be
preempted
then
removal
was
proper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can't
always
rely
on
the
dissent
to
explain
the
rationale
of
the
majority.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
davis.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
scheer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
presumably
if
we
could
decide
this
sort
of
case
by
just
deciding
whether
or
not
we
think
its
preempted,
every
district
court
that's
called
upon
to
make
a
removal
decision
also
would
decide
on
that
basis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
alternative
to
your
way
of
looking
at
it
is
that
the
district
court
would
simply
make
a,
decide
whether
or
not
it's
obvious.
you
know,
it
may
be
51-49,
but
this
is
the
way
i
come
down
on
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
old...
the
law
governing
convening
of
three
judge
courts
had
something
much
like
that
in
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
insurance
company
is
interested
in
keeping
general
motors'
business
certainly.
it
isn't
as
if
it's
just
totally
self-interested.
it
doesn't
want
a
whole
bunch
of
complaints
from
employees
that
their
claims
have
been
wrongly
turned
down.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
we
get
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we'd
get
a
wrong
xxx
to
gm
too.
[laughter]
i
mean,
what
does
gm
really
want?
does
it
want
a
few
dollars
saved
on
insurance
or
does
it
want
better
industrial
relations?
none
of
those
things,
i
think,
are
crystal
clear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
xxx
a
remedy
for
a
small
claim
ends
up
in
federal
court
in
jackson,
mississippi,
or
madison,
wisconsin,
when
if
you
could
sue
in
state
court
you
might
be
many
miles
closer
to
home
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
saying
that
the
congressionally-designed
remedy
for
claims
was
to
benefit
small,
small
claims.
i'm
suggesting
that
a
small
claimant
might
find
the
distance
necessary
to
travel
to
a
federal
court
a
good
deal
more
onerous
than
the
distance
to
a
much
nearer
state
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
no
event
could
the
venue
provisions
of
erisa
provide
anything
better
than
the
nearest
federal
court
house?
they're
not
going
to
build
a
new
court
house
near
you.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
the
case
is
submitted.
