mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
is
concerned
that
handicapped
persons
get
the
full
measure
of
protection
intended
for
them
by
congress
in
enacting
and
amending
section
504.
there
is
also
concern
that
section
504
be
kept
within
manageable
bounds.
and
that
means
that
it
not
be
invoked
to
deal
with
all
manner
of
social
problems
which
were
no
in
congress'
mind
when
it
enacted
that
statute.
in
particular,
we
think
it
is
important
that
congress
had
no
intention
to
displace
the
web
of
local,
state,
and
federal
responses
to
the
very
different
and
the
very
difficult
problem
of
contagiousness
and
epidemic.
that
problem,
and
that
difficulty,
is
well
illustrated
by
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
school
board,
acting
at
the
instance,
indeed,
at
the
insistence,
of
county,
state...
county
and
state
health
authorities,
removed
from
a
third
grade
classroom
the
respondent,
ms.
arline.
having
complied
with
these
state
directives,
the
school
board
now
faces
a
suit
under
section
504
for
handicapped
discrimination.
we
maintain
that
this
cannot
be
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
section
504
and
amended
it.
when
congress
amended
section
504
in
1974,
it
extended
the
coverage
to
cover
not
only
persons
who
are
presently
handicapped,
but
persons
who
have
a
record
of
handicap,
and
also
persons
who
are
believed
to
be
handicapped.
further,
congress
expanded
the
definition
of
handicapped
to
include
any,
quotes,
impairment
which
substantially
limits
one
or
more
major
life
activities.
but
in
the
original
enactment,
as
well
as
in
the
amendment,
one
feature
remained
constant:
that
to
come
within
the
statute
at
all,
to
count
as
handicapped
discrimination
or
exclusion
at
all,
the
exclusion
must
be,
quotes,
solely
by
reason
of
handicap.
and
this
phrase
is
what
keeps
the
statute
within
manageable
bounds.
this
phrase
is
what
keeps
it
from
covering
exclusion
on
all
manner
of
other
kinds
of
grounds,
good
or
bad.
and
it's
this
phrase
which
demonstrates
why
respondent's
suit
was
properly
dismissed
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
charles
fried
the
statute
couldn't
be
clearer,
justice
o'connor.
the
handicap
is
defined
as
any
impairment
which
substantially
limits
one
or
more
major
life
activities.
mr.
charles
fried
those
are
all
major
life
activities.
but
it
would
be
to
argue
in
a
circle
to
say
that
if
one
is
excluded,
for
instance,
by
reason
of
contagiousness,
from
associating
with
others,
then
that
exclusion
constitutes
an
impairment,
when
the
question
you're
asking
is,
whether
the
exclusion
itself
is
by
reason
of
handicap.
that's
a
totally
circular
argument
which
lifts
itself
by
its
bootstraps.
the
impairment
has
got
to
be
in
respect
to
an
activity
which
is
defined
and
considered
apart
from
the
exclusionary
action
which
is
the
subject
of
the
lawsuit,
of
the
complaint.
now,
contagiousness
and
handicap
are
obvious
different
things.
some
people
are
contagious
without
being
handicapped;
others
are
handicapped
without
being
contagious.
they
often
go
together;
but
not
always.
other
characteristics,
as
well,
may
often
go
together
with
handicapped.
for
instance,
age;
occupation;
poverty;
lifestyle.
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
any
of
these
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
count
as
exclusion
solely
by
reason
of
handicap.
in
this
case,
nothing
could
be
clearer
than
that
the
exclusion
which
took
place
was
solely
on
the
basis
of
contagion.
the
school
board
did
not
know
that
there
was
any
impairment
in
ms.
arline
whatsoever.
they
had
no
reason
to
think
that
she
had...
was
unable
to
perform
her
duties;
there
was
no
absenteeism;
there
was
no
deficiency
in
her
work.
the
first
they
heard
of
this
matter
was
when
they
were
contacted
by
the
local
health
authorities
and
told--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
she's
plainly
a
handicapped
person.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
plainly
a
handicapped
person;
no
question
of
that.
the
point
that
we
insist
on
is
that
the
exclusion
can't
possibly
be
viewed
as
having
been
solely
by
reason
of
handicap.
indeed,
it
wasn't
by
reason
of
handicap
at
all.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
indeed
not.
indeed
not.
because,
so
long
as
she
was
contagious...
and
it's
quite
clear
that
it's
possible--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
yes.
but
you
can
have
a
contagious...
you
can
be
in
a
contagious
condition
with
tuberculosis,
and
if
not
tuberculosis,
with
a
number
of
other
diseases,
without
being
in
the
least
bit
impaired.
indeed,
the
american
medical
association,
at
page
6
of
their
brief,
recognizes
the
phenomenon
of
the
asymptomatic
carrier,
that
is
to
say,
the
person
who
is
infectious,
who
can
spread
the
disease
to
others,
but
is
in
now
way
impaired
himself.
and
in
that
case,
if
the
action
is
taken
on
the
basis
of
that
contagiousness,
the
fact
that
the
person
is
or
is
not
handicapped
is
simply
irrelevant
to
the
lawsuit
under
section
504.
so
if
ms.
arline
had
been
an
immune
carrier,
a
sort
of
a
medical
phenomenon
which
is
well
recognized,
and
she
had
been
removed
because
she
was
an
immune
carrier,
a
typhoid
mary,
as
it
were,
that
would
plainly
not
be
exclusion
on
the
grounds
of
handicap.
it
would
be
exclusion
on
the
grounds
of
contagiousness.
the
fact
that
she
was
also
a
handicapped
person
does
not
mean
that
the
exclusion,
which
plainly
was
on
the
basis
of
the
contagiousness,
all
of
a
sudden
becomes
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
a
handicap.
mr.
charles
fried
so
far
as
the
record
indicates,
there
is
no
other
basis
for
concluding
that
she's
handicapped.
but
another
basis
might
exist.
she
may
have
had
shortness
of
breath.
she
may
have
had
night
sweats.
she
may
have
had
some
of
the
other
symptoms
of
tuberculosis.
but
the
school
board
knew
nothing
of
this.
the
school
board
did
not
act
in
response
to
any
of
this.
and
therefore,
whether
she
was
handicapped
or
not
was
irrelevant
to
the
school
board's
action,
and
should
be
irrelevant
to
this
action.
mr.
charles
fried
we
believe
she
was
not,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
fried
she
was
not
otherwise
qualified,
because
a
person
who
poses
a
risk--
mr.
charles
fried
--at
the
time
she
was
terminated,
she
was
contagious.
and
she
had
been--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
believe
so,
justice
marshall,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
not
at
the
time
her...
not
at
the
time
she
was
excluded
from
the
classroom.
mr.
charles
fried
at
the
time
she
was
excluded
from
the
classroom,
she
was
in
a
contagious
condition.
and
a
person
in
a--
mr.
charles
fried
--not
to
the
knowledge
of
the
school
board.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
she
was
released
on
full--
mr.
charles
fried
--she
was
released--
mr.
charles
fried
--she
was
released
from
the
classroom,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
because
the
exclusion
was
the
exclusion
from
the
classroom.
and
she
was--
mr.
charles
fried
--because
of
her
contagiousness.
no
other
reason.
mr.
charles
fried
forgive
me,
i
think
i
misunderstood.
she
was
qualified
in
other
respects,
except
her
contagiousness:
quite
correct.
that
is
so.
but
in
respect
to
her
contagiousness,
this
was
a
properly
disqualifying
characteristic.
mr.
charles
fried
i
believe
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
regulations
appear
to
cover
that
case.
mr.
charles
fried
in
regard
to
irrational
reasons
for
excluded,
handicapped
reasons,
i
hope
that
our
argument
would
say
that
those
are
not
sufficient
reasons,
and
they
constitute
discrimination.
but--
mr.
charles
fried
--in
our
view,
that
person
is
not
handicapped
because,
to
quote
the
statute,
that
person
is
not
impaired
in
respect
to
a
major
life
activity,
except
by
virtue
of
the
exclusion.
but
that's
that
circular
argument
again.
mr.
charles
fried
that
particular
phrase
in
the
regulation,
in
our
view,
exceeds
the
purpose
and
the
language
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
we
think
it's
an
incorrect
reading
of
the
statute.
it's
an
incorrect
reading,
which
once
again
causes
the
statute
to
burst
those
manageable
bounds,
and
to
start
dealing
with
a
whole
lot
of
other
subjects
which
were
not
in
congress'
contemplation
at
the
time.
mr.
charles
fried
such
a
person
is...
would
clearly
be
considered
handicapped.
mr.
charles
fried
because
there
are
some
life
activities,
if
i
may
traverse
the
assumption--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
there
would
still
be
some
activities
which
a
one-armed
person
could
not
perform
in
the
same
way
that
a
two-armed
person
could.
mr.
charles
fried
i
believe
so.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
employment
certainly
is
one
of
them.
but
if
the
question
is,
are
you
able
to
carry
out
the
employment?
ms.
arline
was
able
to
carry
out
the
employment
but
for
the
exclusion.
the
only
reason
she
couldn't
teach
third
grade
was
that
they
wouldn't
let
her.
now,
that
kind
of
inability
surely
can't
be
what
the
statute
referred
to,
because
that
is
your
circular
argument.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
that...
it
would
certainly
interfere
with
it.
but
it
would
not
impair
her
ability--
mr.
charles
fried
--if
i
may,
i'd
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
the
time
for
mr.
hayes'
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
fried
that
sweeps
no
more
broadly
than
the
term,
impairment.
you
have
the
definition
of
an
impairment,
and
that
is
something
that
restricts
you
in
a
major
life
activity,
your
ability
to
perform
a
major
life
activity.
and
if
you
are
regarded--
mr.
charles
fried
--then
you
are
regarded
as
not
being
able
to
engage
in
a
major
life
activity.
so
if
the
school
board
had
thought
that
by
reason
of
her
tuberculosis
ms.
arline
was
unable
to
teach
third
graders...
not
that
they
wouldn't
let
her
teach
third
graders,
but
that
she
was
unable
to
do
so...
then
she
would
be
regarded
as
having--
mr.
charles
fried
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
because
tuberculosis
is
not
the
impairment.
the
impairment
is
whatever
prevents
you,
the
very
condition,
the
shortness
of
breath,
the
hospitalization,
whatever,
which
prevents
you
from
engaging
in
the
activity.
the
word,
tuberculosis,
is
perfectly
ambiguous.
it
can
cover
the
condition
of
being
contagiousness
without
any
impairment,
or
it
can
cover
the
impairment
as
well.
and
i
think
we
musn't
get
caught
up
in
that
ambiguity.
