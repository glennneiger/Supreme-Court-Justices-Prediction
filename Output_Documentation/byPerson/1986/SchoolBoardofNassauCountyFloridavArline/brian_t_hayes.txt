mr.
brian
t.
hayes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
this
court
considers
whether
the
contagious,
infectious
disease
of
tuberculosis
is
a
handicap
under
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973.
additionally,
a
second
question
is
presented
as
to
one
so
infected
is
otherwise
qualified.
because
of
the
split
argument
with
the
solicitor
general,
i
will
address
the
facts
and
point
two;
the
solicitor
general
will
address
his
remarks
to
point
one
in
the
brief.
the
facts,
we
submit,
in
this
case
are
extremely
significant.
and
the
nondisputed
facts
are
as
follows.
in
1977
gene
arline
was
a
tenured
teacher
with
the
nassau
county
school
system,
teaching
in
the
south
side
elementary
school.
the
school
board
had
no
knowledge...
none...
that
she
had
in
fact
suffered
from
tb
since
age
14.
in
1977
she
had
a
relapse,
that
is,
she
became
infectious,
had
a
positive
culture.
she
was
suspended
briefly.
in
19...
in
the
spring
of
1978,
she
again
suffered
a
relapse,
and
at
that
time,
mr.
marsh,
the
superintendent,
was
contacted
by
the
state
health
department,
the
local
unit
there
in
fernandina
beach,
which
is
in
nassau
county.
and
they,
that
is,
the
state
health
department,
recommended
that
this
teacher
is
an
unacceptable
risk;
please
take
her
out
of
the
classroom.
she
was
not
dismissed.
she
was
removed
with
pay
for
the
balance
of
the
1978
year;
that
is,
it
was
in
may,
so
there
was
only
perhaps
a
month
to
go.
the
next
fall,
in
november,
she
again
tested
positively,
making
the
third
positive
test
within
an
18-month
period.
at
this
point,
once
again...
now
dr.
mceuen
enters
the
case,
dr.
mceuen
being
a
superior
to
dr.
lund.
and
dr.
mceuen,
who
was
assistant
director
for
the
state
tuberculosis
center,
came
to
the
school
board,
initiated
the
process,
and
said
to
mr.
marsh:
this
woman
poses
an
unacceptable
risk.
she
was
again
suspended
with
pay.
and
in
the
spring,
late
spring
of
1979,
the
school
board
conducted
the
administrative
procedure
to
commence
her
dismissal.
this
procedure
was
eventually
affirmed
by
the
state
court,
the
first
district
court
of
appeals
in
florida.
in
1982
she
filed
her
complaint
in
the
district
court
in
jacksonville,
and
a
trial
was
set,
alleging
for
the
first
time,
of
course,
that
she
was
discriminated
against
because
of
her
handicap.
there
was
actually
two
counts
in
the
complaint,
but
the
only
count
we're
concerned
with
is
count
one.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
yes.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
in
19...
our...
the
transcript
of
testimony
indicates
that
in
1957
she
was
hospitalized.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
no,
during
this...
well,
yes--
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
--they
are
oftentimes,
justice
marshall.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
it
was
not
in
this
case,
as
we
understand,
largely
because
through
dr.
mceuen's
testimony,
that
it's
no
longer
necessary
with
the
new
drugs
since
1950.
they
can
give
heavy
doses
of
this
medication,
which
can
immediately
reduce,
or
have
an
effect
to
attempt
to
reduce,
the
infectiousness.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
that's
uncontradicted,
that
she
was
not...
now,
she
was
hospitalized,
she
testified
at
page
77
of
the
transcript
in
the
trial,
about
her
being
hospitalized
at
age
14,
at
sunland
center
in
tallahassee.
she
she
had
a
history
of
being
hospitalized,
although
we
didn't
know
it.
in
any
event,
as
i
was
indicating,
after
the...
the
trial
court
in
this
case
then
went
on
and
found,
in
an
alternative
type
judgment,
he
found
first
of
all
that
tuberculosis
such
as
she
suffered,
and
those
are
his
words,
and
i'm
quoting,
it's
the
court's
opinion
that
an
infectious
disease
such
as
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
had
does
not
qualify
as
a
handicap.
but
then
he
went
on
to
say,
if
it
does,
assuming,
arguendo,
that
it
does,
then
the
court
must
consider
whether
she's
otherwise
qualified.
this
goes
into
our
second
point.
if
she's
not
otherwise
qualified,
she
has
not
met
her
burden.
the
burden
is
clear
in
a
handicap
discrimination
case,
or
in
a
case
under
the
rehabilitation
act.
as
justice
marshall
said,
as
recently
as
choate
v.
alexander,
the
plaintiff
must
establish
that
she
has
a
qualifying
handicap.
she
must
establish
that
she
is
otherwise
qualified.
she
must
establish,
if
she's
alleging
discrimination,
that
she
was
discriminated
solely
because
of
her
handicap.
now,
if
she
fails
in
any
of
those
particulars,
the
case
is
not
made
out.
this
court
has
stated
in
southeastern
community
college
v.
davis,
which
is
the
benchmark
case
on
"otherwise
qualified",
that
simply
means
that
with
the
handicap,
or
notwithstanding
the
handicap,
he
or
she
can
meet
all
the
of
the
requisite
requirements,
the
legitimate
requirements,
of
the
job.
we
suggest
on
point
two
that
an
infectious
disease,
where
a
doctor...
and
this
is
not
a
doctor
employed
by
the
school
board;
this
is
the
state
health
professional...
where
that
doctor
says,
nassau
county
school
board
and
mr.
marsh,
don't
put
this
teacher
in
a
classroom
with
young
children,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
they're
highly
susceptible,
and
number
two,
it's
an
enclosed,
confined
room.
and
tb,
as
we
know...
tb
may
be
unique.
i'm
not
a
medical
expert,
but
we
know
it's
communicated
by
breathing,
by
sneezing,
by
coughing.
so
it's
our
position
on
point
two
that
how
can
she
be
qualified
as
an
elementary
school
teacher
when
she
can't
get
down
over
johnny's
desk
and
help
him
with
his
penmanship
and
arithmetic
without
breathing,
and
thus
creating
a
risk.
but
this
isn't
our
opinion.
this
is
an
opinion
of
a
state
health
professional.
so
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
suggest,
the
record
amply
supports
the
trial
judge's
finding
that
if
it's
not
a
handicap,
then
she's
not
otherwise
qualified.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
yes.
as
the
testimony
of
superintendent
marsh
says
in
this
case,
that
she
did
not
have
a
certificate.
in
our
reply
brief,
we've
addressed
that,
justice
powell.
she
was
certified
k
through...
k
through
6,
which
is
the
basic
elementary
certification.
that's
our
next
question
under
otherwise
qualified.
could
we
have
accommodated
her...
that's
the
next
inquiry...
by
letting
her
teach
high
school?
well,
there's
two
factors
there.
number
one,
she
wasn't
certified
to
teach
high
school.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
absolutely,
and
she
did
not
seek
to
get
it.
on
page
77
of
the
transcript,
i
asked
her
at
the
trial...
this
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix...
on
a
full
page,
mrs.
arline,
did
you
consider
during
the
intervening
four
years
going
and
taking
the
nine
or
twelve
hours
in
french
or...
whatever
you
need?
she
said
she
did
not.
but
that's
only
the
first
part
of
that
question.
we
would
have
a
different
inquiry,
and
it's
not
before
the
court,
had
she
been
certified.
and
then
we'd
be
faced
with
dr.
mceuen's
testimony
that
the
risk
is
real
as
to
all
persons,
but
it's
certainly
an
unacceptable
risk
as
to
elementary
school
teachers.
so
in
a
way,
we
have
not
reached
that
question
of,
had
she
been
certified
because
she
has
not.
we
simply
suggest
that
the
regulation
is
quite
clear,
under
the
duty
to
accommodate.
there
have
been
no
cases
of
this
court...
there
have
been
some
lower
court
cases...
but
in
referring
to
the
duty
to
accommodate,
the
regulations
specifically
refer,
and
i'm
talking
about
45,
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
84.4
kl.
and
it
says:
the
duty
to
accommodate
a
handicapped
person,
who
with
reasonable
accommodation
can
perform
the
essential
functions
of
the
job
in
question.
now
the
job
in
question,
we
suggest,
is
an
elementary
school
teacher,
in
an
elementary
school
setting.
so
it's
our
position,
therefore,
that
she
is
not
otherwise
qualified
for
the
position.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
yes,
sir,
justice
scalia.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
yes,
sir.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
in...
the
evidence
was,
and
the
solicitor
general
will
speak
to
that
extensively,
sometime
in
the
past,
in
1957,
which
we
didn't
know
about,
as
it
turns
out,
until
the
trial...
so
that
goes
to
the
question
of
solely
by
reason
of:
did
we
use
that
as
a
basis.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
okay.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
well,
that
goes
to
the
question,
the
definitions
of
impaired.
if
a
person
was
hospitalized
sometime
in
the
past,
and
then
we
get
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
she
had
a--
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
--that's
correct.
or
a
record
of
such
impairment.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
well,
the
impairment...
the
question
there
would
be
whether
or
not
the
impairment
related
to
the
contagiousness,
or
to
the
disease
of
tuberculosis.
we
think
that's
a
difference.
and
mr.
fried
will--
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
--well,
there
is
a
question...
there's
no
question
in
the
record
that
as
a
child
she
was
hospitalized
for
this
disease.
and
that's
undisputed.
it's
also
in
the
record--
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
--we...
we...
as
the
trial
judge--
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
--that's
correct.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
correct.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
we
would,
at
this
time,
at
least
for
point
two,
suggest
that
we
would
accept,
as
the
trial
judge
did,
that
if
she
was
indeed...
if
she
was
indeed
impaired
or
had
a
record
of
such
impairment
by
hospitalization,
for
the
purposes
of
point
two,
we
suggest
it's
not
important,
because
she
would
be
not
otherwise
qualified.
mr.
fried
will
now
address
the
court
on
that
issue.
thank
you.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
yes,
sir,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
answer
some
questions
that
were
raised
during
direct,
or
the
argument
of
the
respondent,
we
would
like
to
remind
the
court
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
we
did
make
the
statement,
justice
scalia,
i'm
quoting:
in
short,
it
is
evident
that
while
certain
of
the
individuals
having
tuberculosis
may
be
obviously
impaired
by
the
disease,
others
may
not.
we
have
not
made
a
per
se
statement
that
everybody
in
the
world
who
has
tuberculosis
will
never
be
impaired.
i
want
to
also
go
into
some
of
the
medical
problems
that
have--
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
--well,
this
is
a
situation--
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
--if
she
had
a
handicap,
justice
white,
it
would
only
be
on
the
basis
of
a
past
record--
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
--yes.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
yes.
we
suggest--
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
--we
suggest,
justice
white,
that
she
can
be...
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
she
can
be
considered
handicapped,
that
is,
get
by
the
threshold
question,
so
we
can
explore
then
the
question
of,
solely
by
reason
of,
and
the
question
of,
otherwise
qualified.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
no.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
i
don't
think,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
any
record
that
she
was
impaired
in
any
way.
she
taught
for
13
years.
there's
no
evidence
that
she
missed
a
day
of
class.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
i
understand
that.
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
i
concur,
the
petitioners
concur
100
percent
with
the
solicitor
general,
who
says,
those
regulations,
to
that
extent--
mr.
brian
t.
hayes
--she
had
a
record
of
handicap;
there's
no
question
about
it,
justice
scalia.
but
we
want
to
address
that,
on
the
tuberculosis
questions,
the
american
medical
association
stated
very
clearly
in
their
brief,
they
said
the
same
thing
essentially
that
we
did,
they
said
the
disease
of
tuberculosis
manifests
itself
through
a
variety
of
symptoms.
some
diseased
people
have
no
symptoms
at
all.
one
of
the
real
problems
in
this
case...
the
actual
question
raised
by
mr.
rahdert
as
to
why
the
doctor
recommended,
i
think
justice
marshall,
that
she
be
removed,
not
just
suspended
again
and
again
and
again,
was
this.
the
question
was
asked
at
page
13
of
dr.
mceuen,
and
she
said...
you
know,
the
attorney
for
ms.
arline
asked
her,
and
dr.
mceuen
said,
quote:
because
small
children
are
considered
highly
susceptible
to
tuberculosis,
and
because
the
pattern
of
relapse
suggested
that
there
may
be
a
possibility
of
further
relapses.
this
gets
into
the
other
testimony
about
one
of
the
difficulties
in
diagnosing
when
a
person
is
infectious.
that
is
the
test
where
they
take
a
sputum
test.
it
often
is
six
or
eight
weeks.
and
so
you're
diagnosed,
if
you
will,
in
arrears,
in
arrears
of
the
judgment.
thank
you.
