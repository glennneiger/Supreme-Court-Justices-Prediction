well,
if
a
discharge
or
termination
is
by
reason
of
the
contagion,
which
isn't
itself
a
handicap,
why...
why
is
there
coverage?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
if
you
find
the
person
who
has
tuberculosis,
but
there's
no...
the
person
is
just
a
carrier.
let's
assume
there's
no
impairment--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
she's
contagious,
or
he's
contagious.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
what
is
the
impairment?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
anyone
who
has...
any
contagious
person
who
can
transmit
person,
you
say,
is
a
handicapped
person?

about
the

have
a
handicap?
justice

r.
white

you...
i
take
it
the

general
said
that
this

was
a
handicapped
person.
