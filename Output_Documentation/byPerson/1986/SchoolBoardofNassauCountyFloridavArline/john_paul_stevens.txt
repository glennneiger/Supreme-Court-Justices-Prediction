mr.
general,
how
do
you
respond
to
justice
scalia's
question?
how
about
her
record
of
hospitalization?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
you
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
mister--
--if
you
had...
if
you
had
removed
the
handicaps,
she
wouldn't
have
been
excluded.
if
there
had
been
no
history
of
tuberculosis,
she
would
have
still
had
her
job,
wouldn't
she?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
wouldn't
be
contagious
if
she
didn't
have
tuberculosis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fried,
what
about
a
person
who
loses
one
arm.
i
have
a
friend
who's
lost
an
arm
and
who's
able
to
do
everything
i
can
do.
he
can
do
every
major
life
activity
you
can
think
of.
is
that
person
handicapped
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
of
these
people
do
magnificent
achievement,
and
are
able
to
do
things
that
everyone
else
can
do.
but
that...
if
they
achieve
the
level
of
skill
that
the
average
person
has,
would
they
not
cease
to
be
handicapped?
justice
john
paul
stevens
major
life
activities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
employment
is
not
one
of
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
parents
of
the
children
wouldn't
let
the
children
enter
the
classroom
because
they
were
afraid
of
contracting
the
disease?
would
that
impair
her
ability
to
teach?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
have
to
have
some
pupils
in
order
to
be
able
to
teach,
i
suppose.
