mr.
fried,
what
is
the
handicap
of
someone
who's
diseased?
is
it
the
disease,
or
is
it
the
manifestations
of
the
disease,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
employment
a
major
life
activity?
or
association
with
other
people?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fried,
suppose
someone
has
an
accident,
is
burned,
and
becomes
hideously
disfigured.
and
the
employer
does
not
want
to
have
anyone
disfigured
in
the
office
and
lets
them
go.
now,
the
act
just
doesn't
cover
that.
because
the
exclusion
in
your
view
is
on
the
basis
of
the
employer's
dislike
of
the
disfigurement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
do.
and
so
it's
very
hard
to
understand
where
your
argument
would
take
us
with
regard
to
irrational
reasons
for
excluding
handicapped
people.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
person
who's
just
disfigured
as
a
result
of
a
previous
injury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fried,
may
i
inquire
before
you
sit
down
about
the
last
part
of
the
section
defining
handicapped
individual,
which
says
someone,
a
person
with
an
impairment,
who
is
regarded
as
having
an
impairment
is
a
handicapped
person.
how
broadly
does
that
sweep,
do
you
say?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
who
is
regarded
as
having
such.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
think
that
if
the
school
board
thought
that
one
manifestation
of
tuberculosis
was
contagiousness,
and
because
of
the
tuberculosis,
which
they
regarded
as
her
impairment,
that
that
puts
her
under
the
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
rahdert,
on
that
first
point
for
a
moment,
as
i
understand
it,
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
all
people
with
tuberculosis
are
handicapped.
do
you
support
that
holding
of
the
eleventh
circuit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
phrase
it
another
way.
do
you
agree
with
me,
then,
that
not
all
people
with
tuberculosis
are
handicapped?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
the
eleventh
circuit
meant
something
broader
than
that,
they
were
wrong.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
a
different
disease
where
the
person
is
not
handicapped,
not
impaired,
but
is
a
carrier?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
assuming
the
person
is
not
physically
impaired.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rahdert,
do
you
intend
to
explain
how
someone
who
is
actively
contagious
with
an
impairment
of
tuberculosis
can
be
otherwise
qualified
to
teach
small
children?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
someone
is
actively
contagious
with
tuberculosis,
how
can
that
person
be
otherwise
qualified
to
teach
small
children?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
accommodation
requires
finding
another
job
for
the
person?
or
doesn't
it
relate
to
the
job
the
person
has?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
rahdert,
that
is
what
was
asserted
to
have
happened
here
with
the
state
public
health
officer,
who
said
she
wasn't...
she
shouldn't
be
allowed
in
the
classroom.
