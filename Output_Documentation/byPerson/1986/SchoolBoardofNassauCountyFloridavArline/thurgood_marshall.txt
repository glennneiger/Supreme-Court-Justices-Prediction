mr.
hayes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
she
at
any
time
hospitalized?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
during
this
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
aren't
infectious
people
hospitalized
in
florida
usually?
justice
thurgood
marshall
compulsory,
if
necessary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
wasn't
it
done
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
uncontradicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
general
fried,
wasn't
she
otherwise
qualified,
within
the
words
of
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
rehire
her
twice.
and
you
rehired
her
because
she
was
no
longer
contagious.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
before
that,
she
had
taken
time
off,
and
had
been
rehired
twice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then,
wasn't
she
otherwise
qualified?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wasn't
she
in
a
contagious
condition
that
first
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
that
your
opponent
said
that
twice
she
was
released
on
full
salary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
why
was
she
released?
3--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--because
she
was
contagious.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
she
was
contagious.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
she
was
otherwise
qualified.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
other
reason
was
she
excluded
from
the
classroom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i...
well,
that
makes
her
otherwise
qualified.
or
we're
talking
about
something
i
don't
understand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
if
it's
in
remission?
