first
this

in

85-1277,
the
school
board
of
nassau
county,
florida
versus
gene
h.
arline.
mr.
hayes,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hayes.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
we'll
hear
new
from
you,
mr.
rahdert.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rahdert,
the
government,
as
i
understand
it,
contends
that
the
handicapped
act,
one
way
or
the
other,
was
not
intended
to
reach
what
they
describe
as
the
web
of
local
and
state
regulations
governing
communicable
diseases.
don't
we
have
something
of
the
same
kind
of
question
here
that
was
involved
in
our
penhurst
decision
of
a
few
years
ago?
congress
grants
money
to
state
and
local
governments,
and
says,
you
take
it
on
these
conditions.
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
turns
out,
ten
years
later,
that
maybe
the
conditions
are
construed
far
more
broadly
than
the
governments
thought
they
were
at
the
time
they
took
the
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
that
bring
each
individual
person
who
is
perhaps
quarantined
in
some
way
by
the
local
governments,
does
that
bring
her
into
federal
court
for
a
case-by-case
determination
under
this
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
someone
had
scarlet
fever,
if
people
still
get
scarlet
fever
anymore,
and
they're
quarantined
for
three
weeks
or
something
like
that.
when
they
have
scarlet
fever,
are
they
handicapped?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
the
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
was
mrs.
arline
discharged
or
suspended?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that's
terribly
relevant
that
she
was
found
not
contagious
in
1983
when
the
question
is
whether
it
was
a
discriminatory
discharge
in
1979?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
one
form
of
accommodation
that
the
statute
might
require
was
that
even
if
she
were
contagious,
she
could
continue
to
teach
elementary
school
children?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rahdert.
mr.
hayes,
do
you
have
something
more?
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hayes.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-1277,
school
board
of
nassau
county,
florida
versus
arline
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
