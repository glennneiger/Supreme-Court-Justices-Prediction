mr.
george
k.
rahdert
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
both
issues
presented
on
this
case
are
narrowly
drawn,
and
present
the
court
with
the
identical
choice.
the
petitioners,
as
they
have
framed
the
issue
in
their
cert
petition,
would
have
this
court
enact
a
per
se
rule
which
categorically
excludes
people
with
infectious,
contagious
tuberculosis
from
coverage
under
the
rehabilitation
act.
the
second
question--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--justice
scalia--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--justice
scalia,
if
i
can
refer
to
the
first
question
presented
on
review,
which
was
presented
in
the
cert
petition
of
the
school
board:
whether
the
contagious,
infectious
disease
of
tuberculosis
constitutes
a
handicap
within
the
meaning
of
section
504.
the
issue
that
was
initially
briefed
by
the
petitioners
was
a
per
se
issue.
the
petitioners
analyzed
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
since
contagious
diseases
were
not
specifically
included,
they
are
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
question
as
originally
presented
was
a
per
se
question.
if
the
petitioners
are
receding
at
the
per
se
question,
and
we
are
looking
at
contagiousness,
it
is
our
contention
that
contagiousness
goes
to
the
second
question
presented,
which
is
whether
mrs.
arline
was
qualified.
essentially,
the
questions
framed
in
this...
in
this
appeal
pose
first
the
question
of
coverage,
and
second,
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
remedy,
whether
mrs.
arline
is
qualified.
we
would
argue
that
the
contagiousness
goes
to
the
second
question,
is
very
properly
part
of
the
analysis
of
whether
mrs.
arline
is
qualified
to
remain
as
a
teacher
in
the
nassau
county
school
system,
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
coverage
and
whether
she
is
excluded.
if
that
first
issue
has
been
conceded
in
oral
argument,
i
think
the
focus
should
be
on
whether
she
is
otherwise
qualified.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
justice
o'connor,
as
i
read
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion,
and
i
will
concede
that
there
are...
there
are
some
loose
dicta
preceding
their
actual
holding...
they
are
saying
that
someone
who
is
afflicted
with
infectious,
contagious
tuberculosis,
such
as
mrs.
arline,
can
be
covered
because
that--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--i
certainly
agree
with
that
proposition.
and
i
would
refer
to
the
ama
brief.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
if
that's
the
reading
of
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion,
it
certainly
stands
to
be
clarified.
our
position
is
that
someone
with
infectious,
contagious
tuberculosis,
certainly
someone
such
as
mrs.
arline,
who
as
the
eleventh
circuit
observed,
has
a
condition
that
fits
neatly
within
all
three
categories
of
the
definition
of
a
handicapped
person,
should
be
considered
covered,
and
should
be
allowed
the
analysis
of
the
second
issue,
whether
she's
also
qualified.
whether
her
contagion
prevents
her
from
being
qualified,
and
as
the--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--i
interpret
it...
and
if
you
will
read
the
petitioners'
initial
brief,
the
petitioner
initially
argues
that
it
can
never
constitute
a
handicap,
because
congress
meant
to
exclude
all
contagious
diseases
from
the
coverage
of
504.
what
has
happened
is
that
i
think
the
justice
department
position,
their
gloss
on
the
rehabilitation
act,
takes
an
effect
from
the
cause,
contagion
caused
by
tuberculosis;
analyzes
that
in
a
vacuum,
somehow
segregated,
separated
from
the
underlying
impairment,
and
argues
that
contagion
alone,
discrimination
against
contagion
alone,
and
in
their
words,
whether
reasonable
or
not,
constitutes
discrimination
that
is
not
covered
by
the
act.
we
would
suggest
that
contagion
should
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
the
qualified
question.
if
someone
who
has
a
contagious
impairment
can
have
medical
management
of
that
impairment
and
be
qualified.
justice
o'connor
asked
the
question
of
preceding
counsel
whether
irrational
reasons
could
be
reached
under
this
contagion
analysis.
and
i
quote
page
23
of
the
government's
brief,
suggesting
that
if
the
reasons...
if
the
discrimination
is
focussed
solely
on
contagion,
whether
reasonable
or
not,
in
the
government's
language,
that
would
elude
coverage.
i
know
that
the
aid's
memo
has
been
lodged
with
the
court.
that
is
the
genesis
of
the
government's
position.
and
in
that
document
the
government
has
written,
section
504
simply
does
not
reach
decisions
based
on
fear
of
contagion,
whether
reasonable
or
not.
that...
justice
o'connor
asked
where
this
question
would
carry
us,
this
theory
of
justice
would
carry
us.
and
i
submit,
it
would
carry
us
to
exactly
that
point,
where
irrational
fear
eludes
the
act.
and
mrs.
arline
argues
that
that
is
completely
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
and
intent.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
as
a
matter
of
fact,
left
handedness
has
been
ruled
in
the
lower
courts
not
to
be
a
handicap.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
it's
an
irrational
consideration,
but
it's
not
a
consideration
of
a
condition
of
impairment.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
justice
scalia,
certainly
the
act
does
not
reach
all
irrational
decisions.
but
we
contend
that
irrational
decisions
which
are
related
to
an
impairment,
a
handicapping
condition
such
as
tuberculosis,
should
and
would
be
reached.
and
the
error
in
justice's
position
is
that
it
is
taking
a
condition
of
an
impairment,
isolating
that
condition,
and
suggesting
that
discrimination
can
be
addressed
to
that
condition
in
the
abstract.
we
contend
that
a
consideration
of
contagion
necessarily
is
a
consideration
of
the
impairment
of
the...
impairing
conditions
as
defined.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i
think
the
act
is
clear.
and
as
the
court
has
analyzed,
i
believe
in
the
choate
case,
that
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo;
that
the
receipt
of
federal
monies
requires
some
accommodation
of
the
handicapped.
with
respect
to
the
web
of
state
and
local
regulations
of
communicable
diseases,
we
suggest
that
far
from
impairing
that
process,
the
question
of
whether
mrs.
arline
or
someone
with
tuberculosis
is
fact
specific,
those
are
medical
facts
which
should
be
considered.
and
it
would
be
a
very
important
part
of
the
qualification
issue.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
if
there
were
discrimination,
it
would
be
subject
to
review
in
the
courts.
if
that
person...
if
that
person
were
handicapped
as
defined,
they
would
have
coverage
under
504.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
your
honor,
that
would
depend
on
the
medical
facts
pertaining
to
that
impairment,
whether
it
fits
within
the
three-part
criteria.
i
don't
know
that
much
about
scarlet
fever.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
contagion
alone
is
not
a
self-defining,
an
automatic
definition
of
handicapped.
a
handicapped
person
is
someone
who
has
an
impairment
which
substantially
limits
major
life
activities,
such
as
working
and
breathing,
under
the
regs.
or
whether
that
person
has
a
history
of
such
an
impairment,
or
whether
that
person
is
regarded
as
having
such
an
impairment.
so
it
would
be
a
fact
question
in
the
first
instance
to
determine
coverage.
and
no,
not
all
contagiousness
is
a
handicap.
but
certainly--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--justice
white,
we
suggest
that
a
decision
based
on
contagion
is
not
going
to
be
made
abstractly,
or
isolated
from
the
underlying
impairment.
as
in
this
case,
with
any
medical
analysis
of
contagion,
assuming
that
decisions
will
be
made
on
medical
facts,
there
will
be
an
evaluation
of
the
medical
history
of
the
particular
person,
part
two
of
the
definition.
each
case
depends
on
whether...
what
is
in
the
minds.
if
there
are
irrational
assumptions
being
made,
stereotypes--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--if
i
can--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--if
i
can
respond
to
that
on
the
specifics
of
tuberculosis.
my
understanding
of
tuberculosis,
and
it's
detailed
in
the
ama
and
the
american
public
health
association
briefs,
is
that
to
be
contagious,
you
must
have
pulmonary
tuberculosis.
it
has
to
be
in
and
around
the
lungs.
you
have
to
have
an
impairment.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
impairment
would
be
a
respiratory
system
dysfunction,
which
is
specifically
defined
under
the
regulations.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
it's
a
serious
impairment
when
it
reaches
the
contagiousness
stage.
there
have
been
15
million
americans
who
have
been
exposed
to
tuberculosis
who
have
been
infected
by
it
and
who
are
not
active
carriers.
i
would
draw
a
distinction
between
those
people
and
the
few
who
have
pulmonary
dysfunction
as
a
result
of
tuberculosis.
incidentally,
pulmonary
dysfunction
is
defined
elsewhere
in
the
act,
for
other
purposes,
as
a
severe
handicap,
specifically.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
with
respect
to
a
different
disease,
it
would
depend
on
the
medical
facts
of
that
disease,
as
well
as
how
that
person
is
regarded.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
it
still
is
a
fact
question,
first
as
to
coverage,
whether
the
person
is
regarded
in
some
manner
as
being
impaired.
it's
a
case-by-case
question,
simply
one
that
doesn't
admit
to
per
se
rules.
with
respect
to
that
hypothetical
person,
there
would
be
a
further
question,
which
would
be
a
medical
fact
question
of
whether
that
person
is
otherwise
qualified;
whether
than
condition
would
require
some
job
modification
or
accommodation,
or
whether
it
could
not
be
reasonably
accommodated.
i
would
make
the
point
that
the
ama
has
made
in
their
brief.
contagion
is
simply
not
a
monolithic
concept.
it
varies
in
degree.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
justice
white--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--i
would
suggest
that
contagion
itself
is
not
a
handicap,
but
the
underlying
impairment
to
which
it
is
inextricably
bound,
could
be
a
handicap.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
impairment
is
defined
in
terms
of--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--the
point...
i
agree
with
you
that
impairment
has
consequences.
in
fact,
under
part
one
of
the
definition,
under
the
statute,
the
consequences
are
looked
to
to
define
whether
it
is
a
covered
impairment,
whether
it
substantially
affects
major
life
activities.
but
are
argument
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
real
world
as
discrimination,
whether
reasonable
or
not,
based
solely
on
contagion.
it's
going
to
be
based
on...
if
it's
based
on
any
kind
of
a
reasonable
and
factual
analysis,
it
will
be
based
on
the
medical
history,
which
any
doctor
would
take;
and
more
importantly,
the
fearful
response
to
contagion
is
a
fearful
response
to
the
underlying
impairment.
i
would--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--certainly.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
that's
right.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i
would--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--i
would
submit
that
the
impairment
is
tuberculosis.
and
the
fearful
reaction
to
contagiousness
is
a
fearful
reaction
to
tuberculosis
and
what
it
can
do;
that
we
really
have
a
very
clear
case
of
coverage
when
there's
a
severe
case
of
tuberculosis
as
here.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
if
the
tuberculosis
were
in
remission
and
not
contagiousness,
coverage
would
depend
on
part
two,
which
is
history,
and
part
three,
how
that
person
is
regarded.
and
that's
very
important.
congress
meant
broad
coverage
in
the
instances
of
irrational
fear,
of
stereotype,
of
assumption.
and
so
coverage
would
be
defined
by
the
act
of
discrimination
of
the
act
of
assumption.
as
choate
notes,
very
often...
very
often
discrimination
is
not
invidicus
animus,
but
indifference,
assumption;
and
the
legislative
history
suggests
discrimination
is
often
based
on
stereotype
and
fear.
to
allow
contagion
to
be
separated
out
and
be
the
basis
of
discrimination
would
be
to
completely
eviscerate
the
act
in
its
purpose
of
preventing
stereotype
discrimination.
justice
marshall,
in
your
opinion
in
choate,
you
talked...
you
analyzed
the
tennessee
medicare
rules
in
that
case
in
terms
of
whether
they
were
facially
neutral,
or
whether
they
had
an
exclusionary
effect
on
the
handicapped.
and
you
looked
to
whether
they
were
based
on
criteria
that
were
a
test,
judgment
or
trait...
and
the
court
used
the
word
trait...
of
handicapped
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
rules
and
whether
they
were
violative
of
the
act.
contagion
is
exactly
the
same
question.
contagion
is
a
trait
of
the
underlying
impairment.
and
we
contend
that
there
is
no
reality
in
the
real
world
of
someone
acting
irrationally
but
parsing
it
down
so
finely
that
it
is
directed
to
contagion
in
the
abstract.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i
intend
to
present
that
to
the
district
court,
justice
o'connor.
the
question
is
a
fact-bound
question,
as
has
been
universally
recognized.
if
you
look
at
the
regulations
on
otherwise
qualified,
they
deal
in
facts.
medical
facts
are
obviously
the
key
issue
in
this
particular
case
and
in
many
handicapped
cases.
and
so--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--we
would
not
contend
for
a
moment,
justice
o'connor,
that
an
actively
contagious
person...
tuberculosis
sufferer
should
be
in
a
classroom.
and
i
want
to
correct
one
misstatement
of
the
record
by
the
solicitor
general.
there
was
no
record
evidence
in
this
case
to
indicate
that
at
the
time
of
termination
she
was
contagious.
what
happened
in
this
case
was,
as
soon
as
they
found
out
about
the
recurrence,
she
was...
she
was
put
on
leave
and
was
discharged
several
months
later
through
administrative
proceedings.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
specific
evaluation
of
her
current
condition.
the
only
evidence
we
have
in
this
very
sparse
record
concerning
mrs.
arline
and
her
contagiousness
was
that
at
the
time
of
trial
she
had
been
free
of
contagion
for
quite
some
time.
and
the
medical
expert
testified
that
she
had
not
received
reports
of
positive
tests
indicating
current
contagion
since
1979.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
trial
was
in
1983.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
at
the
end
of
the
school
year,
1979,
i
believe.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i
think
the
relevant
question
would
be,
was
her
contagion
revealed
in
i
believe
november
of
1978
under
control
at
the
time
that
her
future
in
her
career
as
a
teacher
was
being
weighed
and
determined.
and
we
suggest
that
there
should
be
accommodation
that
should
be
considered.
we
suggest
that
in
this
case,
on
this
record,
it
appears
there
was
no
consideration
of
accommodation
during
the
termination
process.
there
was
a
judgment
made--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--i
think
accommodation
primarily
refers...
and
whether
she's
otherwise
qualified,
it's
essentially
the
same
question...
refers
to
medical
condition
primarily.
with
respect
to
other
jobs,
we're
not
suggesting
that
affirmative
action,
simply
that
evidently
in
this
case,
as
the
district
court
seems
to
have
found,
there
were
job
transfer
options
that
were
policies
of
this
school.
and
we
merely
ask
that
she
be
considered,
just
like
a
nonhandicapped
person
would
be,
for
the
usual
and
routine
policies
of
the
school
board.
but
our
point
on
whether
she
is
otherwise
qualified
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
standards
of
this
court,
in
fact,
which
suggest,
for
example,
in
choate,
a
balancing
test;
in
davis,
locked
at
very
detailed
efforts
to
evaluate
and
see
if
the
person
could
fit
into
the
program
and
whether
the
program
would
be--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--not
at
all.
not
at
all.
if
she
were
continuously
contagious,
i
would
conceded
she's
not
otherwise
qualified.
we're
suggesting
that
tuberculosis
is
a
condition
that
medical
science
has
made
great
progress
in,
and
as
the
ama
has
pointed
out,
95
percent
of
the
cases
of
active
contagion,
pulmonary
tuberculosis,
can
be
rendered
noncontagious
within
two
weeks
of
proper
chemotherapy.
that
possibility
certainly
should
be
explored
in
mrs.
arline's
case,
and
was
not.
but
no,
as
a...
a
person
actively
contagious
could
not
teach
at
that
time.
perhaps
the
school
board's
normal
leave
policies
would
allow
an
accommodation
to
return
this
woman
to
productive
participation
in
her
career,
which
is
the
underlying
objective
of
the
statute.
the
question
justice
o'connor
raised
about
cosmetic
disfigurement
is
a
very--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
that
severe,
because
if
proper
medical
procedures
were
followed...
we
don't
have
a
record
of
that
precision
in
this
case...
i
would
suggest
that
following
state
health
guidelines,
as
the
state
health
guidelines
are
constituted
would
not
in
any
manner
constitute
discrimination.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
justice
scalia,
the
questions
you
raise,
first
of
all,
there
are
instantaneous
testing
methods
for
tuberculosis.
the
frequency
of
those
methods,
those
testings,
would
be
established
by
disease
control
standards.
the
center
for
disease
control,
cited
in
the
apha
brief,
talks
about
getting
people...
treating
tubercular
patients
on
an
individualized
basis,
getting
them
back
into
work
as
quickly
as
possible.
that's
florida
law.
that's
arizona
law.
so
i
would
suggest
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
public
health
standards
were
followed,
and
followed
consistently,
there
just
simply
wouldn't
be
a
floodgate
of
litigation;
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
means
of
accommodating
an
impaired
person.
we
very
much
endorse
a
medical
determination
of
mrs.
arline;
a
medical
determination
of
all
tuberculosis
patients.
and
by
extending
coverage,
and
by
allowing
a
remedy
under
this
broad
remedial
federal
legislation,
we
would
encourage
exactly
this
process
of
not
reacting
to
public
sentiment;
not
reaction
to
parents;
not
reacting
to
members
of
the
school
system
personnel,
which
occurred
in
this
case
and
is
part
of
the
record;
but
evaluating
specifically
on
medical
considerations.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
justice
o'connor,
it's
not
clear
on
this
record
whether
the
state
officer
said,
at
this
time;
whether
she
said,
this
lady
should
be
terminated
completely
for
all
times.
that
simply...
that
analysis
which
should
be
done
was
not
done;
is
not
evident
on
the
record.
moreover,
and
more
importantly,
the
district
court
assumed,
based
on
his...
the
judge's
assumption
of
congressional
intent,
which
is
really
not...
to
which
no
citations
were
given...
that
there
was
a
per
se
exclusion.
and
i
think
if
the
court
reads
the
district
court's
opinion,
it
will
read
it
to
be
a
very
broad
exclusion
of
contagious
people
from
the
act;
and
a
further
assumption
that
contagious
people
can
never
be...
or
people
who
have
at
some
point
a
contagious
impairment,
can
never
be
qualified.
so
there
were
no
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court
of
a
sufficient
nature
to
decide
this
highly
fact-bound
question.
and
we
contend
that
the
eleventh
circuit
judge
vance
appropriate
remanded,
based
on
that
kind
of
record,
and
based
on
a
decision
that
went
off
much
like
an
order
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
erroneous
legal
points.
justice
o'connor
asks
about
cosmetic
disfigurement.
that
has
been
in
the
regs
since
1977.
it
is
a
clear
example
of
discrimination,
stereotyped,
or
in
the
government's
terms,
whether
rational
or
not,
a
reaction
to
a
condition
of
handicap.
and
the
reaction
to
the
condition
simply
cannot
be
parsed
out
and
separated
and
segregated
from
the
reaction
to
the
condition
itself.
justice
described
that,
in
their
initial
brief,
as
anomalous,
and
suggested
that
cosmetic
disfigurement
discrimination
could
come
under
the
act
if
there
was
a
perceived
or
actual
nexus
to
the
impairment.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
regulations
answer
that
question
in
terms
of...
defining
an
impairment
as
a
medical
deficiency.
and
so
ugliness
would
not,
but
someone
with
facial
burns
who
suffered
an
anatomical
loss,
would.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
from
the
regulations,
your
honor.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
regulations
get
it
from
a
substantial
impairment
of
a
major
life
activity,
of--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--it
would
have
to
be--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--to
just
answer
this
question,
it
would
be
an
impairment.
an
impairment
is
the
handicapping
condition.
and
impairment
is
not
just
not
fitting
the
norm
cosmetically,
but
having
something
physiologically
go
wrong
in
your
life
which,
in
turn,
substantially
limits
major
life
activities.
i
would
suggest
that
cosmetic
disfigurement
from
a
cause
such
as
a
facial...
severe
facial
burn
would
be
such
an
impairment
and
have
the
limitation
on
life
activities
that
ugliness
would
not.
