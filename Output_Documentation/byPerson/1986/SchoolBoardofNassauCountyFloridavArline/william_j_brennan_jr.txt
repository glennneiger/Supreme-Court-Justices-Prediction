justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
is
amended,
prohibits
a
federally
funded
state
program
from
discriminating
against
a
handicapped
person,
solely
by
reasons
of
his
or
her
handicapped.
the
question
for
decision
in
this
case,
is
whether
a
person
affected
with
a
contagious
disease
here
tuberculosis,
maybe
considered
a
handicapped
individual
within
the
meaning
of
section
504
and,
if
so,
whether
such
an
individual
is
otherwise
qualified,
the
language
of
statute,
to
teach
elementary
school.
respondent,
arline,
taught
elementary
school
in
nassau
county,
florida
for
13
years
after
she
had
been
hospitalized
for
tuberculosis
in
1957.
reflection
had
been
in
remission
for
20
years
when
it
recurred
in
1977.
she
had
three
lapses
in
the
next
two
years.
in
1979
the
school
board
discharged
her,
saying
they
did
not
do
so
because
she
had
done
anything
wrong
but
because
of
the
continued
recurrence
of
tuberculosis.
respondent
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court,
alleging
that
her
discharge
violated
section
504.
the
district
court
held
that
all
there
was
no
question
that
she
suffers
a
handicapped,
through
it
was
nevertheless
not
a
handicapped
person
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
persons
with
contagious
diseases,
are
within
the
coverage
of
the
act
and
remanded
the
case
with
determination
whether
the
risks
of
infection
precluded
respondent,
from
being
otherwise
qualified
for
her
job
and,
if
so,
whether
it
was
possible
to
make
some
reasonable
accommodation
for
her
in
that
teaching
position
or
in
some
other
position.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
fact
that
the
person
with
a
record
of
impairment,
as
in
the
case
of
respondent,
is
also
contagious
does
not
remove
that
person
from
section
504's
coverage.
to
allow
an
employer
to
justify
discrimination
by
distinguishing
between
a
disease's
contagious
affects
and
others
and
as
physical
affects
in
a
patient,
would
be
unfair,
contrary
to
the
act
in
its
legislative
history,
which
demonstrates
congress'
concern
about
an
impairment's
affect
on
others,
and
woule
be
inconsistent
with
section
504's
basic
purpose
to
ensure
that
a
handicap
individuals
are
not
denied
jobs
because
of
the
prejudice
or
ignorance
of
others.
the
act
replaces
such
faithful
reflective
reactions
with
actions
based
on
reasoned
in
medicate
sound
judgments,
as
it
to
whether
contagious
handicapped
persons
are
otherwise
qualified
to
do
the
job.
the
united
states
argues
that
it
is
possible
for
a
person
to
be
simply
a
carrier
of
a
disease,
that
is
to
be
capable
of
spreading
a
disease
without
having
a
physical
impairment
or
suffering
from
any
other
symptoms
associated
with
a
disease.
the
united
states
contends
that
this
is
true
in
the
case
of
some
carriers
of
the
acquired
immune
deficiency
syndrome
that
is
the
aids
virus.
on
this
premise,
the
united
states
concludes
that
discrimination
solely
in
the
basis
of
contagiousness,
is
never
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
a
handicapped.
the
argument
is
emplaced
in
this
case
because
the
handicap
here,
tuberculosis,
arise
both
with
physical
impairment
and
the
contagiousness.
this
case
does
not
present
and
we
therefore
do
not
reach
the
questions
whether
a
carrier
of
a
contagious
disease
such
as
aids
would
be
considered
to
have
a
physical
impairment
or
whether
such
as
person
could
be
considered,
solely
on
the
basis
of
contagiousness,
a
handicapped
person
as
defined
by
the
act.
the
chief
justice
joined
by
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
