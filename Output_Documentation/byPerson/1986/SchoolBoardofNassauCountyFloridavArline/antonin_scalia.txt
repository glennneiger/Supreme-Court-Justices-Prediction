mr.
hayes?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
your
point
that
she
is
not
a
handicapped
individual,
you're
not
merely
arguing
that
she
was
discriminated
against
by
reason
of
her
handicap,
but
you're
also
asserting
that
she
is
not
a
handicapped
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
yet
you
say
that
she
has
been,
by
reason
of
a
disability
produced
by
the
tuberculosis,
hospitalized
on
several
occasions.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
i'm
not
concerned
about
"solely
by
reason
of"
right
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
concerned
about
whether
she's
handicapped.
justice
antonin
scalia
had
a
record
of
such
impairment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
what
does
it
take
to
establish
a
record
of
such
impairment,
beyond
being
in
the
hospital?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
goes
to
whether
she
was
dismissed
because
of
it.
it
doesn't
go
to
whether
she
was
a
handicapped
individual
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
say
she
was
a
handicapped
individual,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
else
you
tell
me
what
else
that
phrase,
has
a
record
of
such...
right
now
she
wasn't
impaired.
she
was
teaching,
she
was
doing
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
she
had
a
record
of
being
so
debilitated
by
tuberculosis
that
she
had
to
be
hospitalized.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
does
that
language
mean
if
it
doesn't
cover
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
say...
you
would
say
that
she
would
not
have
been
a...
the
only
reason
you
acknowledge
that
she's
a
handicapped
person
is
because
of
the
prior
history
of
hospitalization.
and
she
had
not
been
hospitalized
and
been
functioning
perfectly
well,
although
she
had
tuberculosis,
then
you
would
say
she
was
not
a
handicapped
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
we
do
about
the
regulations,
then?
just
ignore
them,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
even
think
it's
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
quite
true.
they
couldn't
be...
they
couldn't
be
dismissed
by
reason
of
their
disability.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understood
both
arguments,
if
the
reason
for
the
firing
is
that
the
person
is
not
able
to
teach
because
they're
ill
now
and
then,
or
something
of
that
sort,
a
person
with
tuberculosis
would
be
covered,
just
as
a
person
with
any
other
disease
that
causes
impairment
would
be
covered.
what
they're
arguing
is
simply
that
dismissing
that
person
because
of
the
threat
of
contagion
would
not
be
covered.
that's
quite
different
from
saying
that
a
person
with
tuberculosis
is
not
covered
at
all,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
everybody
agrees
on
the
point,
as
you've...
as
you've
just
put
it.
unless
that
question
means
whether
the
contagiousness
is
covered
by
the
handicapped
act.
that's
the
only
point
that's
being
argued
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rahdert,
maybe
there's
not
as
much
agreement
on
the
first
question
as
i
thought.
the
question
reads,
whether
the
contagious,
infectious
disease
of
tuberculosis
constitutes
a
handicap.
now,
does
that
ask
whether
it
always
constitutes
a
handicap,
or
whether
it
can
ever
constitute
a
handicap?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
somebody,
an
employer,
is
superstitious,
and
thinks
that
left
handed
people
are
unlucky,
and
chooses
not
to
hire
left
handed
people.
is
that
covered
by
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that's
pretty
irrational,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
that's
exactly
what's
being
argued
here.
that
the
fact
that
it's
irrational
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it's
covered
by
the
act.
you
can
make
some
very
irrational
and
unfair
decisions
as
an
employer,
you
would
acknowledge,
and
not
be
covered
by
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
mere
fact
that
it's
contagious
would
not
cause
it
to
be
a
handicap?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
impairment?
is
the
impairment
tuberculosis?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
impairment
the
consequences
of
tuberculosis?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
you
have
three
things.
you
have
a
disease,
tuberculosis.
one
consequence,
impairment.
and
another
consequence,
contagion.
and
what
the
statute
prohibits
is
dismissing
a
person
or
affecting
a
person
because
of
the
former
consequence,
impairment;
and
not
because
of
the
latter
consequence,
contagion.
i
think
that's
what
the
other
side
is
arguing
here.
now,
why
is
that
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
impairment
due
to
the
difficulty
in
breathing
or
to
whatever
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
--physical
difficulty
there
is?
no.
it's
a
response
to
tuberculosis.
now,
tuberculosis
is
the
disease--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
produces
impairment
and
also
produces
contagion.
now,
you
could
be
afraid
of
it
or
treat
someone
adversely
because
of
it
for
either
of
those
two
reasons,
either
because
of
the
impairment
that
it
produces,
or
because
of
the
contagion
that
it
produces,
couldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
can
produce
contagion
without
impairment,
or
impairment
without
contagion.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
before
you
go
on,
mr.
rahdert,
that
fact-bound
question
would
become
a
federal
question
in
every
cases,
if
your
argument's
right,
correct?
and
all
state
health
measures
of
quarantine
or
dismissal
because
of
contagion
would
be
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of,
you
know,
nice
questions
that
can
be
raised
about
the
remedies
you
suggest.
for
example,
you
say,
within
two
weeks
of
chemotherapy.
but
how
quickly
can
she
be
analyzed
as
having
become
contagious
again
and
what
not?
it
would
be
necessary
to
do
a
test
everyday
or
whatever.
i
don't
know
what
the
answers
are.
i
don't
care.
i'm
just
saying,
it
raises
a
lot
of
fact-bound
issues
which
would
all
be
dumped
into
the
federal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
just
substantial
ugliness?
i
mean
the
person
is
not
just
disfigured,
but
just
not
a
handsome
person?
and
an
airline,
let's
say,
you
know,
said
we
would
prefer
to
hire
good
looking
stewards
and
stewardesses.
we
don't
want
any
ugly
people.
now
would
that...
if...
if
it
is
enough
that
people
associate
with
you
less
readily,
if
that
is
enough
to
constitute
a
disability,
why
wouldn't...
why
wouldn't
just
homeliness
be
a
disability?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
how
do
you
get
that
from
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
where
do
the
regulations
get
it
from
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
a
major
life
activity
is
associating
with
other
people,
and
people
shun
you
because...
i
don't
know
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--ugliness
produced
by
burns
is
any
different
from
people
shunning
you
just
because
of
run-of-the-mill
homeliness.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
she
can
be,
but
is
she?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
she
handicapped?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
doesn't
require--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
just
requires
that
she
have
a
record.
she
was
not
able
to
teach
for
some
period
of
time.
she
was
hospitalized,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
give
it
away,
mr.
hayes?
she's
handicapped,
isn't
she?
she
had
a
record--
