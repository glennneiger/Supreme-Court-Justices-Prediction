justice
scalia
general
brown,
did
you
rely
on
the
debt
collection
act
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
you
can
raise
a
new
argument
in
this
court
that
you
didn't
raise
there?
justice
scalia
you
were
arguing
there
was
no
authorization.
here
aren't
you
construing
this
statute
as
a
prohibition?
or
are
you?
maybe
i
don't
get
the--
justice
scalia
--did
you
make
this
argument
in
your
principal
brief.
justice
scalia
where
was
that?
justice
scalia
did
you
say
anything
about
the
debt
collection
act
in
your
principal
brief?
justice
scalia
so
you
come
in
with
a
reply
brief
that
the
other
side
hasn't
had
an
opportunity...
has
no
opportunity
to
respond
to.
i
frankly
don't
know
what
the
practice
is
on
this
court,
but
on
the
court
that
i
came
from
we
don't
entertain
arguments
first
made
in
the
reply
brief.
if
this
is
such
a
basic
point,
it
should
certainly
have
been
in
the
main
brief.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
that
footnote
continues
after
analyzing
the
state
decisions,
"although
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
the
current
dispute,
because
the
contract
was
entered
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
that
act.
"
"it
does,
however.
"
--i
would
take
that
as
a
concession
that
the
act
is
not
applicable
here,
and
so
would
the
other
side,
so
they
do
not
brief
the
point.
they
do
not
discuss
the
point.
it
looks
like
a
concession.
and
then
in
comes
the
reply
brief,
and
lo,
they
have
been
sandbagged.
if
this
point
is
as
basic
as
you
say,
it
should
certainly
have
been
relied
upon
in
your
principal
brief.
the
footnote
says
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
the
current
dispute.
justice
scalia
although
congress
doesn't
now
think
so,
anyway.
justice
scalia
for
the
future.
i
mean,
should
the
same
series
of
events
arise
in
the
future
it
is
clear
what
would
happen,
isn't
it,
under
the
debt
collection
act?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
but
even
during
the
period
when
the
state
was
acknowledging
the
debt
it
wasn't
paying
it.
it
is
true
that
later
there
was
some
reason
to
believe
there
wasn't
any
debt,
in
this
state
claim
there
was
none,
but
even
when
the
state
acknowledged
there
was
a
debt
it
just
wasn't
coming
up
with
the
money.
how
long
did
that
last?
justice
scalia
how
much
did
the
federal
government
pay?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
it
fair
to
have
the
cost
of
the
use
of
the
money
borne
by
the
people
who
have
been
using
the
money,
which
is
the
taxpayers
of
west
virginia,
who
should
have
paid
up
the
money
many
years
ago,
and
have
been
using
it
in
the
interim?
why
isn't
it
entirely
fair
to
say
they
have
been
using
the
money,
they
have
had
the
advantage
of
it?
it
is
not
as
though
we
are
taking
any
money
away
from
them.
we
are--
justice
scalia
--that
may
well
be,
but
they
have
had
the
use
of
that
money
during
that
whole
interim
period.
why
should
the
federal
government
pay
for
that
use?
justice
scalia
that
may
be,
but,
i
am
just...
as
a
historical
matter
it
may
be,
but
there
is
no
overwhelming
fairness
case.
i
mean,
if
there
is
any
fairness
case
the
person
who
has
been
using
the
money
has
been
the
state
of
west
virginia,
and
all
the
federal
government
is
asking
them
is
to
reimburse
them
for
the
use
of
the
federal
government's
money
during
this
period.
