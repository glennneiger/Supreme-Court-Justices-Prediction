chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-937,
west
virginia
versus
the
united
states.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
brown.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
in
favor
of
the
united
states,
don't
you,
rather
than
against
the
united
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
just
as
a
matter
of
general
law,
general
brown...
certainly
if
this
were
a
quasi-contract
or
money
had
in
received
action
between
private
individuals
and
the
bill
had
been
sent
that
didn't
indicate
interest,
i
wouldn't
think
under
ordinary
common
law
that
would
preclude
a
claim
of
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
brown.
mr.
lauber.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yet
you
have
the
jackson
county
case,
which
of
course
suggests
that
the
fact
that
the
state
is
a
litigant
in
the
action
is
entitled
to
some
consideration.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lauber.
general
brown,
do
you
have
something
more?
you
have
15
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
general
brown,
i
understood
mr.
lauber
to
say
that
the
state
never
pays
it
because
there
is
an
exception
for
the
state
in
west
virginia--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
that
prejudgment
interest
is
normally
awarded
between
private
litigants
in
a
contractual
type--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
brown.
the
case
is
submitted.
