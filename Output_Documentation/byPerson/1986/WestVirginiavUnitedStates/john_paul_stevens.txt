justice

general
brown,
would
you
tell
me
what
your
understanding
of
the
holding
of
the
jackson
county
case
is?
justice
stevens
weren't
there
a
number
of
other
equitable
factors
in
the
case
as
well?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
there
are
any
equities
supporting
the
state's
position
here?
justice
stevens
mr.
lauber,
isn't
it
also
true
that
there
was
no
question
about
the
state's
interest
as
a
litigant
because
the
state
wasn't
a
litigant
in
that
case,
it
was
just
the
county?
justice
stevens
so
their
argument
they
rely
on
that
case
ought
to
apply
to
counties
as
well,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
--may
i
just
interrupt--
justice
stevens
--on
your
notion
about
hurting
innocent
taxpayers.
i
suppose
the
cost
of
the
use
of
the
money
has
to
be
borne
by--
justice
stevens
--either
the
west
virginia
taxpayers
or
by
the
taxpayers
of
the
country
as
a
whole.
so
it
is
just
a
question
of
which
one
has
to
bear
this
burden.
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
and
the
taxpayers
from
california
and
other
states
are
innocent
in
the
same
sense.
justice
stevens
and
of
course
i
gather
on
that
point
the
federal
government
did
pay
a
fair
amount
of
money
in
connection
with
the
disaster--
justice
stevens
--that
was
not
recoverable.
justice
stevens
maybe
that
is
why
you
do
a
better
job
of
balancing
your
budget
than
the
federal
government
does.
