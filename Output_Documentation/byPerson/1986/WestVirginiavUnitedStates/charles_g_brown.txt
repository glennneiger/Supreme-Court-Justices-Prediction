mr.
charles
g.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
1972,
amid
torrential
rains,
a
dam
burst
in
southern
west
virginia.
the
valley
below
was
flooded.
over
100
people
were
killed.
thousands
were
left
homeless,
and
millions
of
dollars
of
property
damage
ensued.
there
was
an
immediate
federal-state
cooperative
effort
to
deal
with
the
tragedy,
a
joint
effort
by
both,
each
side
spending
millions
of
dollars
of
appropriated
funds.
one
of
the
efforts
dealt
with
housing.
the
federal
government
supplied
housing
units.
the
state
supplied
the
land.
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers
prepared
the
sites.
they
prepared
the
sites
in
a
relationship
under
which
the
district
court
found
to
be
a
contract
between
the
federal
and
state
government.
although
finding
a
contract
existed,
the
district
court
held
that
prejudgment
interest
would
not
be
allowed
against
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
applying
cases
involving
private
litigants
in
suits
against
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
reversed...
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
in
favor
of
the
united
states...
excuse
me...
applying
cases
involving
private
litigants
in
suits
against
the
federal
government.
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
contend
two
points
on
oral
argument
today.
one
is
that
the
fourth
circuit
erred
by
equating
the
state
and
private
parties,
and
two,
the
prejudgment
interest
may
not
be
awarded
without
act
of
congress
or
consent
against
a
state.
number
one.
states
are
not
private
litigants.
the
fourth
circuit
committed
error
when
it
put
states
into
the
shoes
of
private
litigants
on
the
prejudgment
interest
issue.
the
last
time
the
court
dealt
with
the
question
it
explicitly
rejected
exactly
the
same
argument,
board
of
commissioners
of
jackson
county,
kansas,
versus
united
states,
in
which
justice
frankfurter,
for
the
court,
said,
"nothing
seems
to
us
more
appropriate
than
due
regard
for
local
institutions
and
local
interests.
"
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
even
cite
board
of
commissioners
of
jackson
county,
kansas.
the
congress
subsequently
has
acted
as
well
and
acted
in
the
same
direction
in
the
debt
collection
act.
the
congress
excluded
state
and
local
governments
from
the
statute,
so
congress
as
well
believes
that
states
and
private
litigants
are
two
different
entities
indeed
when
it
comes
to
prejudgment
interest.
the
more
recent
cases
since
board
of
commissioners
are
along
the
same
lines
which
this
court
has
dealt
with.
congress
is
to
decide
the
constitutional
balance
between
federal
and
state
governments.
in
garcia,
the
court
said
that
congress
would
determine
the
reach,
how
far
the
relationship
would
go,
how
far
congress
would
reach
into
the
power
of
states,
and
that
is
a
congressional
decision.
in
bowen
v.
american
hospital
association
the
plurality
said
that
congress
must
speak
with
a
clear
voice
if
it
wants
to
change
the
relationship
between
federal
and
state
governments,
and
in
pennhurst
i
you
said
that
a
state
must
know
the
terms
and
conditions
of
a
grant,
know
what
is
expected
of
us
before
we
get
that
grant.
not
surprisingly,
the
court
as
well
has
said
that
the
congress
is
the
one
to
decide
how
the
federal
treasury
is
to
be
protected.
the
fourth
circuit
reached
in
to
protect
the
federal
treasury,
but
that
is
not
their
judgment
to
make.
it
is
the
congress's
decision,
us
v
standard
oil
in
the
1940s,
so
congress
has
determined
and
this
court
has
determined,
both
have
said
that
private
litigants
and
states
are
two
different
entities,
and
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
recognize
that.
argument
number
two.
there
is
no
statute
and
there
is
no
consent
applicable
here
so
there
is
no
prejudgment
interest.
the
debt
collection
act
is
a
comprehensive
statute
dealing
with
all
debts
owed
to
the
united
states
government.
congress
is
no
longer
silent
on
the
issue
of
treating
states
different
from
private
litigants,
so
the
need
for
interstitial
law,
for
the
court
to
move
in
and
make
law,
is
reduced.
senator
percy,
and
he
said
this
in
a
letter
after
the
statute
was
passed,
but
senator
percy
was
the
author
of
the
debt
collection
act.
senator
percy
said
that
congress
will
decide
when
the
states
and
local
governments
will
pay
interest.
he
said
this
in
a
letter
to
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
no,
we
did
not.
we
did
not
below.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
justice
stevens,
we
don't
think
we
are
raising
a
new
argument.
we
have
continued
to
stress
that
there
is
no
statute
and
no
consent
pending
or
applicable
here
to
have
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
we
argued
heavily
board
of
commissioners
of
jackson
county.
we
said
that's
what
the
fourth
circuit
should
rely
on.
the
fourth
circuit
didn't
even
cite
the
case.
we
feel
now
that
the
debt
collection
act,
although
not
governing
because
it
was
passed
after
the
flooding
occurred,
is
an
act
of
congress
which
demonstrates
that
congress
believes
what
you
said
in
the
1930s,
which
is
that
states
are
to
be
treated
very
differently
from
private
litigants
when
it
comes
to
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
yes,
we
did.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
we
made
the
argument
that
the
starting
point
has
to
be
the
act
of
congress
and
we
focused
in
our
principal
brief
not
on
the
debt
collection
act
but
on
the
disaster
relief
act.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
mr.
justice
scalia,
we
apologize.
we
do
think
that
the
argument
is
consistent
with
the
points
we
raised
in
the
initial
brief,
although
we
did
add
an
analysis
of
that
statute
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
we
think
that
the
debt
collection
act...
no,
you
don't
need
to
do
that.
we
think
that
the
debt
collection
act
provides
the
same
congressional
guidance
that
you
did
with
board
of
county
commissioners.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
i
think
congress
has
said
that
they
are
supporting
the
common
law
and
they
will
decide
when
the
states
are
to
pay
interest.
that
is
what
senator
percy
said
in
his
letter
and
that
is
what
we
believe.
justice
scalia,
in
footnote
3
at
page
23
of
our
brief
in
chief
we
did
mention
the
debt
collection
act
when
we
analyzed
the
pennsylvania
v.
u.
s.
and
the
perales
case,
which
were
the
two
circuit
decisions
which
said
that
there
would
be
no
prejudgment
interest
going
against
a
state.
we
did
mention
it
at
that
point.
congress
will
decide
when
the
states
are
to
pay
interest,
and
congress
has
said
so.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
the
solicitor,
us
having
dealt
with
the
case
in
a
footnote,
the
solicitor
deals
with
the
case
in
the
footnote
on
page
9
of
the
solicitor's
brief
in
opposition
to
cert,
so
they
mention
it
at
that
point.
but
we
do
think
that
the
board
of
commissioners
of
jackson
county,
kansas,
is
the
case
the
fourth
circuit
should
have
looked
at,
and
it
was
the
case
we
presented
to
them
as
the
deciding
point,
as
a
lodestar
for
deciding
the
case.
congress
will
decide
when
interest
is
to
be
imposed,
and
they
have
done
that
in
very
clear
terms,
as
we
have
said.
in
the
social
security
act,
"interest
at
a
rate
of
6
percent
per
annum
from
date
due
until
paid.
"
that
is
quoting
the
language
of
the
social
security
act,
where
congress
specifically
said
when
interest
would
be
imposed.
in
the
medicaid
statute
they
were
even
more
lengthy
in
making
clear
that
interest
was
to
be
imposed
against
a
state
government.
the
quote
is
"plus
interest
on
such
amount
disallowed
beginning
on
the
date
such
amount
was
disallowed
and
ending
on
the
date
of
such
final
determination
at
a
rate
based
on
the
average
of
the
bond
equivalent
or
the
weekly
90-day
treasury
bill.
"
so,
congress
has
said
when
they
feel
that
the
interest
is
to
be
imposed.
now,
the
disaster
relief
act
simply
uses
the
word
"charges".
it
does
not
say
that
interest
is
to
be
imposed.
interest
is
not
mentioned
in
the
statute.
interest
is
not
mentioned
in
the
legislative
history.
interest
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
the
government
doesn't...
the
executive
branch
therefore
hasn't
even
contemplated
interest
in
this
matter
until
this
case
is
brought,
and
by
the
way,
we
think
this
is
the
only
case
that
we
can
find
under
the
disaster
relief
act
where
the
government
is
seeking
prejudgment
interest.
the
disaster
relief
act
indicates
there
is
no
duty
of
the
state
to
pay.
the
duty
was
imposed
because
of
the
contractual
relationship
between
the
parties.
the
purpose
of
the
relevant
section,
of
course,
was
to
provide
temporary
housing
for
the
victims.
the
disaster
relief
act
contemplates,
in
fact,
five
different
ways
for
the
states
to
pay
these
obligations
or
for
others
to
pay
the
obligations,
states,
local
governments,
private
parties,
the
federal
government
itself,
or
any
combination
of
those
four.
the
disaster
relief
act
even
contemplates
percent
loans
and
money
paid
back.
they
mention
that
6
percent
loans
can
be
made
to
businesses.
that
is
in
the
same
act,
the
disaster
relief
act.
if
congress
at
one
point
talked
about
6
percent
loans,
talked
about
percentage
interest,
they
didn't
talk
about
it
here,
so
it
is
a
different
matter.
just
as
there
is
no
statute
which
calls
for
interest
to
be
paid
by
the
state
of
west
virginia
in
the
disaster
relief
act,
there
is
no
consent
either.
there
is
no
language
in
the
letters.
the
letters
were
the
basis
of
the
contract,
according
to
the
district
court,
and
under
the
record
at
821
and
884,
the
federal
officials
outlined
what
the
letter
should
say.
if
there
is
no
such
language
in
those
letters
which
contemplates
interest,
we
would
think
the
government
at
that
point
didn't
contemplate
interest,
nor
did
the
government
contemplate
interest,
as
the
record
shows,
in
the
bills
that
they
sent
out.
there
was
no
indication
over
the
years
that
interest
was
going
to
be
due
to
the
state.
i
think
when
we
see
the
word
"charges"
in
the
statute
it
is
hard
to
take
that
word
and
say,
well,
that
must
mean
prejudgment
interest,
too.
many
of
us
when
we
get
our
bills,
if
we
get
a
bill
from
a
department,
store
we
expect
the
interest
to
be
added
each
month.
if
we
get
charges,
a
bill
from
the
doctor,
interest
is
usually
not
added
each
month.
so,
the
word
"charges"
is
a
word
that
does
not
automatically
mean
interest,
and
we
think
congress
has
to
say
it.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
no,
it
would
not,
but
i
was
just
talking
about
the
word
"charges"
as
not
reaching
into
the
word
"interest"
because
congress
at
other
points
such
as
in
the
social
security
act
and
the
medicaid
act
have
indeed
said
that
there
should
be
interest.
historically
it
has
been
that
way.
there
has
been
reliance.
people's
expectations
is
that
the
sovereigns
do
not
pay
prejudgment
interest.
both
times
this
case
has
come
to
the
supreme
court
in
the
jackson
county
case
we
mentioned
and
a
case
earlier
than
that,
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
prejudgment
interest
is
not
to
be
made
against
the
state
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
yes.
yes,
i
would,
justice
stevens.
the
holding
of
the
case
was
that
justice
frankfurter
said
that
equitable
determinations
would
govern,
but
the
equitable
matter,
the
equitable
factor
that
he
used
that
made
the
decision
was
due
regard
for
local
interest,
and
that
was
that
factor.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
after
he
made
that
decision
that
there
would
be
no
interest
for
the
state,
he
said,
however,
if
we
had
to
rule
on
general
equity
we
would
rule
with
jackson
county
commission
as
well,
so
as
i
read
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
he
held
for
the
state
solely
on
that
basis...
held
for
the
county
and
the
state
would
have
at
least
as
much
basis
a
fortiori
as
the
county
would,
but
he
held
first
solely
on
that
equitable
ground.
then
he
fell
back
to
balancing
more
equities,
he
said,
if
we
had
to,
but
he
started
with,
however,
if
we
had
to
do
it
the
other
way.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
yes,
yes,
yes,
i
think
there
are.
first,
i
think
any
balancing
of
the
equities
has
to
recognize
in
the
balance
that
west
virginia
is
a
state,
and
that
is
a
fatal
error.
the
district
court
in
fact
balanced
the
equities
in
favor
of
the
state
of
west
virginia.
looking
at
the
disaster
relief
act,
saying
that
the
federal
taxpayers
were
the
ones
to
bear
much
of
the
burden
of
national
disasters,
saying
that
the
people
in
west
virginia
had
suffered
enough
by
going
through
the
flood
and
that
the
obligation
of
the
state
was
not
voluntary
because
it
was
amid
chaos.
there
were
four
factors
the
district
judge
used
in
determining
in
balancing
the
equities
that
the
state,
just
on
a
balance
of
equities,
that
the
state
should
rule,
should
win.
i
wanted
to
point
out
as
well
that
the
state
did
make
a
commitment
of
its
own.
it
mobilized
a
lot
of
effort,
and
ultimately,
although
the
advisory
jury
held
there
was
no
contract,
the
court
held
there
was
a
contract,
so
we
feel
there
was
litigation
in
good
faith
throughout
the
proceeding,
but
litigation
based
on
the
exchange
of
letters,
which
held
that
the
state
was
liable.
if
there
aren't
more
questions,
we
feel
that
it
there
is
to
be
prejudgment
interest
that
decision
must
come
from
congress
or
there
must
be
consent.
neither
exists
today,
and
we
ask
that
the
fourth
circuit
decision
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
i
have
a
few
brief
points.
your
honor.
first,
i
wanted
to
respond
to
the
charge
of
the
state
being
dilatory.
the
fact
is
that
the
advisory
jury
held
that
the
state
was
correct
that
there
was
no
contract.
the
fact
is
that
the
first
district
judge
on
the
case
held
that
there
was
no
duty
by
the
state
to
pay.
he
denied
summary
judgment,
and
he
said
there
would
have
to
be
a
trial
on
the
facts.
those
facts
in
turn
the
jury
found
to
be
such
that
the
state
prevailed.
the
district
judge
found
otherwise
and
ruled
against
the
state,
but
the
district
judge,
partly
based
on
these
equities,
determined
that
the
state
would
not
have
to
pay
pre
judgment
interest.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
justice
scalia,
the
government
alleged
that
the
state
was
acknowledging
the
debt
through
letters
from
the
governor
and
other
officials.
the
state
never
conceded
that
it
was
acknowledging
the
debt
through
those
letters.
i
think
the
district
court
found
that
the
letters
themselves
constituted
the
debt,
not
the
later
acknowledgment,
but
that
the
later
acknowledgment
certainly
factored
against
us
in
his
findings,
i
am
sure.
the
point
is,
there
were
a
lot
of
equities
on
both
sides
in
this
case
from
the
start.
the
state
was
informed
that
it
had
a
duty
to
pay
for
site
preparation.
the
government
continues
to
argue
that.
judge
copenhaver
in
the
district
court
said
the
state
has
no
duty
to
pay,
and
as
i
pointed
out,
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
that
this
could
happen,
including
the
federal
government
paying.
there
was
misinformation
on
both
sides.
the
corps
of
engineers
dealt
with
a
person
that
had
a
budget
of
$50,000.
he
in
turn
mounted
up
$4
million
of
obligations,
and
the
corps
never
informed
him
or
any
of
his
superiors
what
the
ongoing
cost
was
despite
their
procedures
generally
to
do
so.
there
was
no
mention
in
those
letters
that
interest
would
be
paid
and
the
so-called
dunning
letters
the
government
mentions,
there
was
no
mention
there
that
the
state
would
owe
interest.
interest
was
something
that
the
state
found
out
about
in
1978
from
a
1972
flood,
and
it
is
something
that
we
never
were
held
liable
to
pay
until
a
1985
court
decision
which
we
would
not
be
able
to
pay
until
1987,
and
that
gets
us
very
much
to
the
reason
that
there
is
no
prejudgment
interest
against
sovereigns
without
act
of
congress
or
consent.
it
has
been
that
way
historically
and
interest
has
always
been
treated
differently.
witness
library
of
congress
versus
shaw
in
the
last
term
where
you
treated
interest
as
something
different.
the
budget
process
is
different
with
states.
we
have
a
balanced
budget.
forty-nine
states
are
required
to
have
one,
all
but
vermont.
we
have
to
plan.
every
two
years
we
have
to
start
over
with
a
new
legislature.
there
has
to
be
this
planning,
and
the
states
simply
cannot
act
with
the
celerity
of
an
average
man.
a
court
decision
in
many
close
calls
may
be
necessary
and
the
state
won't
even
know
what
interest
would
be
owing
in
the
area
of
prejudgment
interest.
the
state,
by
the
way,
never
pays
prejudgment
interest
under
state
law.
i
wanted
to
clear
that
up
as
well.
the
other
reason
besides
the
budget
process
the
historic--
mr.
charles
g.
brown
--yes.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
besides
the
budget
process
the
other
historical
reason
is,
we
are
punishing
innocent
taxpayers.
congress
protects
itself
through
its
use
of
sovereign
immunity
in
prejudgment
interest
except
when
it
grants
exceptions.
congress
also
acts
to
protect,
state
and
local
taxpayers
as
well.
it
is
no
surprise
that
27
states
filed
in
a
cert
petition
an
amicus
petition
that
cert
be
granted
in
this
case
because
of
the
very
broad
impact,
the
impact
that
this
case
would
have
in
hurting
the
targeted
populations,
the
populations
congress
has
sought
to
help
in
foodstamps,
in
education,
and
so
on,
and
so
on.
a
ninth
circuit
decision,
riley
v.
bell,
is
pending
waiting
on
what
the
court
will
do
here.
so,
we
will
be
hurting
innocent,
taxpayers
and
we
will
hurt
the
targeted
populations
if
the
court
chooses
to
uphold
the
fourth
circuit
decision.
besides
the...
i
wanted
to
deal
with
one
other
point
and
that
is
the
disaster
relief
act.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
yes.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
some
taxpayers.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
that's
right.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
that's
right.
i
think
that
is
why
the
district
judge,
justice
stevens,
said
that
the
disaster
relief
act
was
an
effort
to
spread
out
the
loss
of
these
disasters
to
national
taxpayers
to
the
extent
possible.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
we
both
did.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
we
both
did.
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
charles
g.
brown
--i
believe
$30
million.
the
fourth
circuit
indicated
the
state
had
not
appropriated
any
money.
the
state
spent
$2.2
million,
proportionately
a
lot
more,
and
the
state
committed
really
hundreds
of
people
in
terms
of
resourcing
and
so
on.
that
amount
is
not
calculatable
any
more.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
we
are
asking
them
to
appropriate
in
1987
based
on
a
1972
disaster.
we
are--
mr.
charles
g.
brown
--i
believe
because
historically
it
has
always
been
that
way,
justice
scalia,
that
the
sovereign,
it
doesn't
have
prejudgment
interest
against
it.
when
we
have
two
sovereigns,
of
course,
to
get
into
the
equitable--
mr.
charles
g.
brown
--if
the
states
could
act
with
the
celerity
of
a
private
person,
as
justice
holmes
said
once,
that
may
be
the
same
thing,
but
the
states
simply
are
not
called
on
to
do
that,
and
the
historical
basis
is,
we
have
budgets
and
we
have
delays
in
putting
all
that
together.
that
may
be
one
of
the
reasons--
mr.
charles
g.
brown
--we
have
a
smaller
budget
to
deal
with,
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
in
fact,
we
have
the
second
circuit,
third
circuit,
and
ninth
circuit.
the
second
circuit
in
perales
and
the
third
circuit
in
pennsylvania
v
u.s.--
mr.
charles
g.
brown
--second
and
third
circuit
agree
with
us.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
the
only
side
that
doesn't
is
the
ninth
circuit.
it
was
a
very
perfunctory
treatment
of
the
issue.
the
issue
was
presented
to
this
court
and
the
petition
presented
didn't
even
make
that
an
issue,
the
issue
of
prejudgment
interest.
california
did
not
even
appeal
on
that
issue.
the
board
of
commissioners
was
not
cited.
it
was
simply
a
short
statement
by
the
court
that
interest
would
be
due.
it
did
not
have
the
analysis
that
the
second
and
third
circuit
did,
so
we
think
the
weight
is
more
the
other
way
with
the
second
and
third
circuit,
although
the
fourth
and
the
ninth,
the
case
below
in
the
ninth
circuit
had
gone
the
other
way.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
yes,
it
is,
pennsylvania
v.
u.s.
perales
is
affirming
a
southern
district
of
new
york
case
that--
mr.
charles
g.
brown
--your
honor,
on
clearfield?
mr.
charles
g.
brown
we
think
the
clearfield
line
and
the
royal
indemnity
line
are
private
parties.
we
think
that
the
analysis
should
be
between
the
relative
weight
of
two
groups
of
taxpayers,
and
we
feel
if
we
had
to
get
into
a
state-federal
question
the
issue
should
go
back
to
the
equities,
the
balancing
of
the
equities
used
in
board
of
commissioners.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
somebody's
taxes
are
going
to
pay
for
this,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
yes,
it
is.
mr.
charles
g.
brown
yes,
it
is.
yes,
and
in
board
of
commissioners
the
court
determined
the
dispositive
issue
was
the
due
regard
for
local
interests,
and
we
would
hope
the
court
would
likewise
give
that
due
regard
to
local
interest
unless
the
congress
has
specifically
said
otherwise.
the
disaster
relief
act
simply
doesn't
call
on
interest
to
be
paid.
the
only
word
in
there
is
"charges".
if
congress
wanted
interest
to
be
paid
it
could
have
used
the
medicaid
or
social
security
language
and
that
language
simply
wasn't
present.
we
ask
the
court
to
adopt
the
common
sense
meaning
of
this,
which
is
that
there
has
never
been
any
decision,
any
effort
by
congress
to
ask
the
states
to
pay
interest
in
the
disaster
relief
act.
