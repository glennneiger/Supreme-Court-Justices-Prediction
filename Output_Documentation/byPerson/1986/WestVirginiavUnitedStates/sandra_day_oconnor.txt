justice
o'connor
just
to
clarify
it,
you
are
not
urging
us
to
hold
that
the
debt
collection
act
applies
to
a
previously
entered
into
agreement,
are
you?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
is
certainly
possible
that
congress
included
the
provision
that
it
did
in
the
debt
collection
act
about
interest
against
states
because
it
thought
that
otherwise
the
rule
was
to
the
contrary
under
federal
common
law.
