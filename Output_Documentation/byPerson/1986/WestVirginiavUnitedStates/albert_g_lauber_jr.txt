mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
make
three
points
about
the
debt
collection
act
to
begin
with.
first
of
all,
that
statute
does
not
apply
to
any
debts
incurred
before
october
25th,
1982.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
by
its
terms.
it
is
31
usc
3717(g)(2),
by
its
terms.
now,
that
statute
was
passed
by
congress
to
tighten
up
on
federal
debt
collection
practices,
and
it
did
so
by
mandating
that
interest
be
charged
on
debts
owed
by
any
person,
so
it
made
more
stringent
interest
requirements
nationwide.
it
defined
"person"
to
exclude
states.
both
the
comptroller
general,
an
officer
of
congress,
and
the
justice
department
in
regulations
interpreting
that
statute
nave
interpreted
it
simply
to
preserve,
by
excepting
the
states
from
the
mandatory
interest
requirement,
have
simply
preserved
the
common
law
entitlement,
whatever
it
was,
of
the
national
government
to
get
interest
from
the
states,
and
those
are
set
forth
in
regulations
at
4
cfr
102.13.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
are
litigating
that
right
now
in
several
courts
of
appeals
and
have
not--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--and
have
not
prevailed
thus
far,
but
even
if
we
don't
prevail
on
that
argument,
as
the
third
circuit
held,
the
effect
of
the
act
would
be
to
abrogate
the
common
law
rule
under
which
the
third
circuit
held
we
were
entitled
to
interest,
and
because
the
common
law
rule
applies
here,
that
would
lead
us
to
win
this
case,
we
hope.
i
would
like
to
turn
next
to
a
brief
summary
of
what
we
think
the
salient
facts
are
here,
and
we
think
these
are
important
because
the
outcome
may
turn
on
the
relative
equities
between
ourselves
and
west
virginia.
the
district
court
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
west
virginia
had
entered
into
an
express
unilateral
contract
to
pay
the
corps
of
engineers
for
their
site
preparation
work.
the
governor
requested
that
the
corps
undertake
the
site
preparation
activities,
and
that
oral
request
was
confirmed
shortly
thereafter
in
writing
by
the
state's
director
of
emergency
planning,
who
wrote
a
series
of
letters
to
the
corps
acknowledging
that
site
preparation
was
the
state's
responsibility
under
the
federal
statute
and
that
the
state
"will
be
responsible
for
the
costs
incurred.
"
the
corps
performed
the
work
quickly
and
efficiently
and
the
state
gave
us
releases
to
that
effect.
the
corps
replied
that
bills
would
be
forthcoming.
they
were
promptly
tendered
in
the
amount
of
about
4.2
million.
the
governor
acknowledged
the
debt,
stating
that
he
would
take
steps
to
"consummate
reimbursement",
although
he
expressed
his
doubt
that
he
could
accomplish
reimbursement
during
the
then
current
fiscal
year.
in
response
to
a
series
of
dunning
letters
from
the
corps
the
governor
asked
for
a
meeting
at
which
he
again
acknowledged
the
debt
but
asked
that
the
corps
forbear
from
collection
for
a
time
to
permit
him
to
negotiate
with
the
state's
delegation
in
congress
with
a
view
to
getting
possible
relief
from
capitol
hill.
when
that
failed
settlement
negotiations
ensued,
and
when
those
proved
fruitless
we
were
forced
to
bring
this
action
to
prevent
the
statute
of
limitations
from
running
against
our
debt
collection
activities.
in
the
lawsuit
the
state's
defense
was
that
the
governor
was
incompetent
to
contract
with
the
corps
on
behalf
of
the
state.
their
theory
was
that
in
the
middle
of
this
flood
emergency
the
governor
would
have
had
to
go
through
the
normal
procurement
process
of
competitive
bidding
before
awarding
a
contract
to
the
corps
of
engineers.
the
court
below
rejected
that
defense,
found
there
was
a
binding
contract,
and
held
the
state
was
in
breach
of
its
contract.
the
only...
and
this
court
denied
review
of
that
question.
the
only
question
at
this
stage,
therefore,
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
the
state
should
be
required
to
pay
prejudgment
interest
as
one
element
of
the
damages
for
its
breach
of
contract.
the
interest
would
run
from
the
date
the
bills
were
tendered
in
1972
until
the
date
of
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
eleven
years
later.
the
aggregate
interest
is
now
about
$6
million,
well
in
excess
of
the
original
principal
amount.
the
petitioner
appears
to
agree
with
us
that
this
question
must
be
answered
by
referring
to
federal
law.
that
is
so
because
federal
law
governs
the
interpretation
of
contracts
to
which
the
united
states
is
party
and
also
because
the
debt
here
was
incurred
ultimately
under
a
federal
statute,
namely,
the
disaster
relief
act.
petitioner
also
seems
to
agree
that
the
federal
common
law
rule
is
that
prejudgment
interest
is
awarded
as
matter
of
course
to
the
united
states
in
action
for
breach
of
contract.
the
rationale
of
that
common
law
rule
is
that
where
there
is
a
breach
of
the
contract
to
pay
money
the
creditor
is
damaged
by
the
delay
in
getting
his
money,
and
should
be
awarded
interest
to
make
him
whole
for
his
loss.
the
only
exception
to
this
rule
recognized
by
this
court
is
where
it
would
be
inequitable
on
the
facts
to
award
the
federal
government
prejudgment
interest,
and
the
situation
that
typically
has
led
the
court
to
find
such
inequity
is
where
the
federal
government
delayed
unreasonably
in
asserting
its
claim.
that
happened,
for
example,
in
the
old
case
of
united
states
versus
sandborn
in
135
us,
where
the
court
denied
interest
to
the
federal
government,
where
it
delayed
for
ten
years
in
seeking
to
recoup
money
erroneously
paid
by
the
treasury
to
a
private
party.
it
happened
again
in
the
board
of
county
commissioners
case
referred
to
earlier
where
the
court
denied
interest
to
the
federal
government
where
it
delayed
for
eight
years
in
seeking
to
recover
taxes
on
behalf
of
an
indian
wrongfully
collected
by
a
state,
a
county
in
kansas
on
indian
property.
therefore
we
believe
that
the
federal
common
law
rule
applicable
both
in
cases
against
private
parties
and
against
states
and
their
subdivisions
is
that
interest
is
allowable
unless
it
would
be
inequitable
to
allow
it.
petitioner
here
argues
that
this
federal
common
law
rule
should
not
be
applied
here,
but
that
the
court
instead
should
adopt
state
law
as
the
federal
rule
of
decision,
and
by
state
law
petitioner
does
not
mean
the
generally
applicable
west
virginia
law
of
contract
damages
which,
like
the
federal
rule,
would
allow
interest
for
a
breach
of
contract.
rather,
by
state
law
petitioner
means
the
exception
to
the
general
west
virginia
rule
of
damages
under
which...
which
operates
where
the
state
itself
is
the
defendant
in
the
contract
action,
and
under
that
exception
a
state
is
not
liable,
unlike
other
parties,
for
interest
for
a
contract
breach
unless
it
has
waived
sovereign
immunity
expressly.
so
it
is
that
sovereign
immunity
based
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
petitioner
wants
to
incorporate
here.
that
contention
brings
us
to
the
clearfield
trust
line
of
cases
where
this
court
has
set
for
the
factors
that
are
relevant
in
deciding
whether
to
apply
a
federal
common
law
rule
or
rather
to
adopt
state
law
as
the
federal
rule
of
decision.
the
clearfield
trust
doctrine
as
elaborated
in
later
cases
like
yazell
and
kimbail
foods
essentially
requires
a
balancing
of
the
federal
interest
against
the
state
interests
at
stake.
now,
the
federal
interest
will
typically
require
resort
to
a
federal
rule,
as
this
court
said
in
kimball
foods,
where
the
incorporation
of
state
law
would
"frustrate
a
specific
objective
of
the
federal
program.
"
and
we
think
that
would
be
the
case
here.
although
the
disaster
relief
act
imposed
much
of
the
responsibility
for
bearing
the
cost
of
disaster
relief
on
the
national
government
it
does
affect
a
clear
division
of
labor
and
cost
as
between
the
national
government
and
the
states.
one
of
these
is
that
the
states
are
required
by
the
statute
to
prepare
sites
for
temporary
housing,
and
the
statute
requires
that
this
site
preparation
be
done
by
the
state
"without
charge
to
the
united
states.
"
we
think
that
this
statutory
division
of
labor
and
cost
would
be
frustrated
by
adoption
of
petitioner's
state
law
rule
here
because
the
united
states
would
then
be
required
to
bear
a
substantial
portion
of
the
site
preparation
cost
through
the
loss
of
a
time
value
of
its
money.
quite
plainly
the
present
value
of
paying
the
corps
of
engineers
$4.3
million
when
it
is
due
as
compared
to
the
present
value
of
paying
it
$4.3
million
eleven
years
later
is
much
larger,
and
we
think
that
the
difference
between
the
present
value
of
getting
your
money
now
and
getting
it
15
years
down
the
road
would
operate
as
a
direct
subsidy
to
the
state's
site
preparation
undertakings
in
defiance
of
the
statutory
mandate
that
site
preparation
be
done
by
the
state
without
charge
to
the
united
states.
for
these
reasons
we
think
that
adoption
of
the
state
no
interest
rule
here
would
frustrate
a
specific
purpose
of
the
disaster
relief
act
and
would
therefore
be
improper
under
clearfield
trust.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
depends
on
whether
we
are
right
in
our
construction
of
the
debt
collection
act.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
don't
think
it
is
clear
yet.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
because
our
interpretation
of
that
'82
act
is
that
by
excepting
the
states
from
the
definition
of
"person"
the
statute
merely
excepted
the
state
from
mandatory
interest
pursuant
to
the
statute
and
preserved
the
status
quo
ante
under
which
states
could
be
held
liable
under
the
common
law
where
applicable.
so,
in
our
view
of
the
statute
which
the
comptroller
general
and
the
department
of
justice
have
concurred
in,
we
would
still
be
litigating
this
very
issue
under
the
new
statute.
we
have
lost
that
interpretation,
i
think,
in
two
courts
of
appeals
now,
and
it
is
pending
in
others
at
the
present
time.
the
second
element
of
the
clearfield
trust
doctrine
requires
reference
to
the
state
interests
that
are
implicated,
and
we
think
that
this
factor
as
well
points
to
the
result
i
have
just
reached.
i
think
it
is
helpful
here
to
consider
the
kinds
of
state
interests
that
this
court
has
found
persuasive
in
the
past
in
adopting
state
law
as
the
federal
rule
of
decision.
in
the
yazell
case,
for
example,
the
court
held
that
texas
law
respecting
marital
property
governed
in
interpreting
the
terms
of
an
sba
loan
contract.
the
court
noted
that
the
contract
had
been
negotiated
with
specific
reference
to
texas
law
and
that
the
state
law
at
issue
involved
the
"intensely
local
interest"
of
family
property
and
the
rights
of
married
women,
including
their
capacity
to
contract.
in
kimball
foods
the
court
held
in
another
sba
loan
case
that
state
commercial
law
governed
the
priority
of
creditors'
liens
on
secured
property.
the
court
noted
that
the
sba
loan
there
again
had
been
negotiated
by
reference
to
state
law,
that
the
federal
government
was
acting
as
a
money
lender
in
an
ordinary
commercial
context.
the
state
law
at
issue
was
a
commercial
code
of
general
application
on
which
businessmen
relied
daily
in
making
their
lending
decisions,
and
the
court
held
that
failure
to
adopt
state
law
there
would
have
disrupted
commercial
relationships
in
the
state,
for
example,
by
impairing
the
integrity
of
the
state's
notice
filing
system.
thirdly,
in
united
states
versus
north
carolina,
a
case
in
136
us,
the
court
adopted
state
law
to
decide
the
availability
of
post-maturity
interest
on
a
defaulted
state
bond
held
by
the
united
states.
we
think
the
reasoning
of
that
case
has
been
superseded
by
modern
cases
like
clearfield
trust.
we
think
the
result
in
that
case
was
plainly
correct
under
the
modern
clearfield
trust
doctrine.
there
the
federal
government
had
invested
in
state
bonds,
and
state
law
denied
post-maturity
interest
to
investors
in
those
bonds
generally,
and
the
court,
i
think,
quite
sensibly
held
back
in
1890
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
have
the
rights
attaching
to
a
bond
vary
depending
on
who
happened
to
own
the
bond
at
the
time
of
the
lawsuit
because
the
bonds
were
freely
transferable.
therefore
the
court
correctly
held,
in
our
view,
that
the
state
law
denying
post-maturity
interest
should
apply
to
all
investors,
whether
they
be
private
parties
or
the
federal
government.
i
think
that
the
interests
referred
to
in
the
court
in
these
earlier
cases
stand
in
rather
stark
contrast
to
the
interest
the
state
is
urging
upon
the
court
here
in
support
of
its
state
law
rule.
here
the
state
is
not
trying
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
any
state
program
like
a
bond
program.
it
is
not
trying
to
protect
family
or
property
values.
it
is
not
trying
to
protect
marital
relationships.
it
is
not
trying
to
protect
settled
commercial
expectations
of
its
citizens,
nor
is
it
even
seeking
to
apply
the
general
law
of
interest
under
the
state's
contract
remedy
statute
because
that
would
allow
interest
here.
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
is
to
avoid
paying
money
because
of
a
claim
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
we
think
that
a
claim,
a
mere
claim
of
sovereign
immunity
standing
alone
is
entitled
to
no
weight
when
the
state
is
litigating
against
the
united
states.
it
is
clear
that
sovereign
immunity
did
not
bar
the
federal
government
from
bringing
this
lawsuit
in
which
a
state
has
been
held
liable
for
breach
of
contract,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
sovereign
immunity
should
be
any
more
relevant
in
and
of
itself
in
determining
the
measure
of
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
so,
for
these
reasons
we
think--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
opinion
there
referred
to
state...
to
local
institutions
and
what
justice
frankfurter
went
on
to
say
was
that
under
the
more
modern
law
of
the
court,
indians
had
come
to
be
regarded
increasingly
as
like
any
other
citizens.
although
they
were
in
a
way
the
wards
of
the
federal
government,
justice
frankfurter
said
that
the
law
had
evolved
to
try
and
treat
them
as
much
as
possible
like
any
other
taxpayer.
so
the
federal
government
there
was
suing
on
behalf
of
an
indians
not
in
its
own
right,
and
i
think
the
court
suggested
that
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
important
to
defer
to
the
state's
treatment
of
taxpayers
generally
because
indians
want
to
be
treated
like
any
other
taxpayer
as
far
as
possible,
and
in
any
event
he
went
on
to
base
the
holding
of
the
case
on
the
federal
rule
under
which
interest
is
recoverable
unless
it
would
be
inequitable,
and
he
found
it
would
be
inequitable
because
the
government
had
delayed
for
ten
years...
eight
years
in
bringing
the
action.
so,
i
think
even
the
earlier
discussion
by
justice
frankfurter
in
that
case
does
not
work
against
our
position
here
because
he
was
talking
about
the
state's
interest
in
maintaining
parity
among
its
taxpayers,
including
indians,
and
there
is
no
equivalent
state
interest
in
this
case.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
was
just
the
county.
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
they
would
make
the
same
argument
for
any
political
subdivision
as
well
as
for
themselves.
that's
correct.
so
we
think
that
for
these
reasons
the
state
interest
here,
because
it
is
merely
sovereign
immunity
without
more,
is
not
enough
to
justify
the
adoption
of
the
state
no
interest
rule.
therefore
the
rule
that
should
be
adopted
is
the
federal
interest
rule
which,
as
i
said
before,
is
that
interest
is
awarded
unless
it
would
be
inequitable
to
do
so.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
would
be
another
way
of
putting
it.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
think
the
proper
approach
is
to
adopt
the
federal
rule,
and
the
fact
it
is
the
same
as
the
general
state
rule
maybe
makes
an
even
stronger
case
for
doing
that.
as
i
noted
before,
the
inequity
that
typically
has
caused
this
court
to
deny
interest
to
the
united
states
under
the
federal
common
law
rule
is
where
the
u.s.
has
delayed
in
presenting
its
claim
and
the
other
party
is
innocent.
here,
we
did
not
delay
and
the
state
was
not
innocent.
the
corps
of
engineers
undertook
this
work
at
the
express
request
of
the
state.
the
work
was
well
and
promptly
performed.
we
demanded
payment
promptly
and
repeatedly,
and
the
state
kept
putting
us
off,
using
a
variety
of
dilatory
tactics,
forced
us
to
bring
suit,
and
then
interposed
the
strained
defense
that
they
were
not
liable
for
the
debt
they
had
acknowledged
all
along
because
the
governor
was
incompetent
to
contract
on
behalf
of
the
state.
if
any
inequity
was
practiced
here,
we
think
it
was
practiced
against
us
by
the
state,
and
to
decline
to
award
us
interest
would
damage
us
considerably
and
would
reward
the
state
for
its
dilatory
conduct.
thank
you.
