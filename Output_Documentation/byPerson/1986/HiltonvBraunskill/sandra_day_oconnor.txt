justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
holl,
do
you
think
that
there
is
some
appropriate
inquiry
in
the
federal
court
to
try
to
preserve
the
status
quo
pending
an
appeal?
justice
o'connor
in
which
the
court
might
consider
the
likelihood
of
success
on
appeal
and
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
incarcerated,
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
--well
now,
i
understood
from
the
state's
representative
that
that
question
is
not
clearly
answered--
justice
o'connor
--by
new
jersey
state
law.
you
take
the
position
that
that's
what
the
law
surely
should
be,
and
the
state's
attorney
takes
a
different
view
of
it.
and
i
gather
we
don't
have
a
clear
holding.
justice
o'connor
all
right,
on
state
collateral.
justice
o'connor
is
there
clear
state
case
law
in
the
situation
of
federal
habeas
collateral
relief
as
to
what
applies
in
the
state
of
new
jersey?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
want
to
know
both.
justice
o'connor
all
right.
then
what
is
the
answer?
justice
o'connor
do
you
have
new
jersey
supreme
court
authority
for
that?
can
you
cite
cases
to
me?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
both
agree
there
are
no
binding
decisions,
then,
of
the
new
jersey
courts
on
this
issue?
justice
o'connor
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
let
me
ask
you
about
the
situation
in
the
federal
habeas
proceeding
when
it
results
in
a
determination
in
favor
of
the
prisoner,
and
if
the
state
decides
to
appeal
that
holding.
do
you
think
there
are
federal
interests
at
stake
that
enable
the
federal
court,
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
release
the
prisoner,
to
consider
the
likelihood
of
success
on
appeal
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
well,
doesn't
the
federal
government
have
an
interest
in
being
sure
that
that
initial
decision
was
correctly
reached
and
to
try
to
preserve
the
status
quo
pending
the
further
resolution
of
that
in
federal
courts?
justice
o'connor
and
likewise,
this
court
would
have
no
power
to
stay
a
particular
proceeding
pending
review
here
of
a
habeas?
