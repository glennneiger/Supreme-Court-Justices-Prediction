mr.
john
g.
holl
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
it
involves
a
purely
legal
issue
of
the
interpretation
of
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
23(c),
specifically
the
permissible
factors
that
federal
courts
can
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
release
a
successful
habeas
petitioner
pending
an
appeal
by
the
state.
relying
almost
exclusively
on
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
in
carter
against
rafferty,
the
third
circuit
has
held
and
the
district
court
below
have
held
that
they
will
only
take
into
account
the
possibility
of
flight
in
making
this
decision.
the
state
of
new
jersey,
petitioner
herein,
is
arguing
that
there
are
additional
factors
that
are
properly
considered
under
23(c),
including
the
chances
of
success
on
appeal
by
the
state
as
a
factor
that
the
court
should
take
into
account,
as
well
as
the
dangerousness
of
the
petitioner.
initially,
i
would
note
with
respect
to
the
factor
of
likelihood
of
success
on
appeal,
that
issue
i
don't
think
was
considered
by
the
carter
court.
the
carter
court
concentrated
exclusively
on
dangerousness.
mr.
john
g.
holl
yes.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
correct.
and
i
think
the
rationale
of
the
carter
decision,
which
is
something
that
we
take
issue
with
but
i'll
get
into
later,
even
if
you
apply
the
rationale
of
the
carter
decision,
which
is
the
federal
courts
can
only
take
into
account
what
it
perceives
as
a
federal
interest,
if
you
apply
that
rationale
you
would
see
that
the
chances
of
state
success
on
appeal
is
also
a
federal
interest.
we
have
the
state
as
a
party
in
a
federal
action.
the
respondent
is
a
party
in
a
federal
action.
there
is
an
appeal
to
a
federal
court.
so
the
outcome
of
that
appeal
is
certainly
an
issue
which
the
federal
courts
have
an
interest
in,
and
should
be
an
appropriate
factor
under
23(c)
even
if
you
accept
the
carter
analysis--
however,
we
don't
think
that
the
carter
court
interpreted
23(c)
properly.
we
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
to
reject
the
narrow
interpretation
that
the
carter
court
adopted
here.
the
first
one
is,
the
carter
court
held
that
the
only
interest,
the
only
factor,
is
a
probability
of
flight.
we
think
that
the
language
of
the
rule,
which
is
extremely
broad
and
which
says
that
a
petitioner
is
presumed
to
be
released...
it
doesn't
specifically
use
the
word
of
presumption
of
release,
but
the
state
would
concede
that
the
rule
does
contain
a
presumption
of
release.
the
presumption
of
release
is
there
when
a
petitioner
is
successful
in
district
court,
but
it
can
be
overcome.
he
shall
be
released
unless
a
court
shall
order
otherwise.
in
those
instances...
that's
kind
of
broad
language
right
there.
it's
extremely
broad
language,
and
we
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
believe
that
it
narrowly
confines
the
federal
courts
to
the
probability
of
flight.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
john
g.
holl
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
john
g.
holl
yes,
we
do.
mr.
john
g.
holl
no,
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
state
of
the
law
in
new
jersey.
we
have
a
rule
called
bail
pending
appeal.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
believe
that...
i'm
not
sure
there
was
an
amicus
that
claimed
that
that
was
the
rule
in
this
case,
justice
white.
we
have
a
rule,
a
new
jersey
court
rule
which
was
adopted
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
which
is
entitled
bail
pending
appeal.
and
it
permits
a
court
to
take
into
account
the
dangerousness.
mr.
john
g.
holl
yes,
it
does
specifically.
mr.
john
g.
holl
yes.
and
there
are
no
cases
as
to
whether
or
not
that
rule
applies
to
a--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--a
collateral
proceeding.
but
it's
our
position
that
it
is
the
rule
which
is
most
analogous.
mr.
john
g.
holl
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
reason
here.
the
state
courts
have
already
found
this
man
to
be
dangerous
and
they
have
incarcerated
him.
they
have
already
made
that
finding.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
don't
think
you
have
to
know
to
decide
this
case,
because
i
think
that
would
frustrate
a
federal
interest
in
the
uniform
application
of
the
habeas
rule,
and
it
would
permit
perhaps
a
state
to
come
up
with
a
rule--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
holl
well,
i
think
that
the
law
of
new
jersey
is
rather
clear,
first
of
all,
that
he
would...
that
a
court
would
be
permitted
to
keep
him
incarcerated
pending
his
state
habeas
proceeding
pursuant
to
that
rule.
but
aside
from
that,
the
federal
courts...
if
you
reach
a...
if
you
take
the
position
that
the
decision
whether
or
not,
that
a
federal
court
makes
to
release
a
defendant
is
based
on
the
state
rule,
then
you're
not
going
to
have
a
uniform
application
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
laws,
because
it's
the
federal
court
which
releases
him
pursuant
to
a
federal
statute.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
think
the
answer
is
that
in
this
case
and
in
all
cases
the
state
courts
will
have
considered
the
same
claims
that
are
being
raised
on
habeas
and
will
already
have
made
the
decision
that
the
individual
involved
is
dangerous
and
should
be
incarcerated.
so
i
think
that's
the
rationale
behind
it.
mr.
john
g.
holl
sure,
your
honor.
we'd
be
happy
to
accommodate
the
court
on
that
issue.
mr.
john
g.
holl
well,
this
issue
has
been
researched.
there
are
no
cases
directly
on
point
as
to
whether
or
not
our
bail
pending
appeal
rule
applies
to
a
state
collateral
proceeding.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
correct.
and
there
are
no
cases,
but
we
think
that
the
most
analogous
rule--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--yes,
we
have,
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
g.
holl
this
man,
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
justice
blackmun,
i
don't
know.
he
is
not
incarcerated.
he
has
been
released.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
don't
believe
the
carter
case
is...
oh,
you
mean
in
the
carter
case
at
issue
here?
yes,
i
believe
that's
correct,
that
the
state
did
not
seek
a--
mr.
john
g.
holl
that
case
was
handled
by
the
passaic
county
prosecutor's
office,
which
is
a
separate
entity.
and
i
do
not
know
their
reasons
for
not
seeking
it.
mr.
john
g.
holl
well,
that
could
be
the
reason
why,
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
think
that
there
are
federal
interests
here,
there's
no
question
about
that.
there
are
a
number
of
federal
interests,
including
and
i
think
the
most
important
one
is
the
interest
in
comity
between
the
federal
and
state
systems
here.
the
deference
that
would
be
provided
by
a
rule
permitting
a
court
to
take
dangerousness
into
account
would
result
in
less
of
a
strain
on
the
federal-state
comity
relationship.
mr.
john
g.
holl
yes,
i
do.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
believe
that's
a
very
important
interest
here.
an
important
federal
interest
in
comity
is
to
maintain
the
status
quo
and
to
take
into
account
all
factors
that
are
relevant
to
this
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
stay.
there's
no
good
reason
in
law
or
justice,
and
the
courts
are
required
under
section
2243
of
the
habeas
corpus
law
to
dispose
of
these
matters
as
law
and
justice
require.
that's
a
broad
standard.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
think
if
we
have
an
instance
where
the
state
does
not
have
a
substantial
case
on
appeal
and
all
we
had
is
a
dangerous
individual
who
was
being
held
under
an
unconstitutional
conviction--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--it
hasn't
been
finally
decided.
mr.
john
g.
holl
likelihood
of
success
on
behalf
of
the
prisoner?
mr.
john
g.
holl
in
that
case
i
think
that
if
the
state
can't
make
an
issue,
a
showing
that
it
also
has
a
substantial
case--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--a
substantial
case
on
the
merits,
if
we
can't
make
that
showing
and
all
we
have
is
a
dangerous
fellow,
i
don't
think
we
have
been
able
to...
there
is
a
presumption
there
that
he
shall
be
released,
and
i
don't
think
we've
been
able
to
overcome
it
purely
on
the
grounds
of
dangerousness.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
think
likelihood
of
success
is
the
more
significant
factor.
mr.
john
g.
holl
no,
that's
not
what
carter
said.
mr.
john
g.
holl
carter
said
that
you
can't
consider
dangerousness.
it
did
not
discuss
that
issue.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that
is
what
that...
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
holl
they
said
that
in
the
decision
in
carter.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
correct.
i
guess
you
could
make
that.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
the
court
of
appeals
even
considered,
though,
the
likelihood
of
success
as
a
factor.
and
that's
why
i
believe
that,
even
if
they
used
their
same
rationale
that
they
used
in
carter,
that
the
federal
courts
only
take
into
account
the--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--no.
mr.
john
g.
holl
we
think
that
it
is
a
weighing
process
here.
i
think
the
courts
have
to
weigh
whether
the
state
or
the
respondent
has
a
substantial
case
on
the
issue,
not
necessarily
a
likelihood
that
it's
more
likely
than
not.
we're
not
getting
involved
in
a
numbers
game.
we're
more
interested
in,
if
the
state
can
show
it
has
a
substantial
case
on
the
merits
of
an
appeal
and
it
can
also
show
there
is
dangerousness,
we
think
those
two
factors
should
be
taken
into
account
and
considered
and
weighed.
in
some
cases
the
courts
will
find
that
the--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--no.
mr.
john
g.
holl
yes,
it
was,
but
then
the
state
made
a
motion
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
reconsider.
and
that
motion
has
been
granted
by
the
third
circuit.
mr.
john
g.
holl
and
the
prior
order
which
affirmed
the
district
court's
decision
has
been
vacated.
so
there
is
no
order
in
effect
from
the
third
circuit.
mr.
john
g.
holl
yes.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
holl
well,
i
don't
think
that's
the
reason
that
they
adopted
that
or
they
made
that
decision.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
think
that
in
the
courts
below
there
is
not
a
sufficient
record,
unfortunately,
because
of
the...
some
factors
just
simply
haven't
been
considered.
the
district
court
wouldn't
consider
likelihood
of
success.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
think
what
we're
asking
from
this
court
is
a
decision
on
the
law
that
these
are--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--no,
because
the
state
went
before
the
district
court--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--and
attempted
to--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
holl
and
he
also
said
that
he
would
not
take
into
account
the
state's
chances
of
success.
mr.
john
g.
holl
there's
a
factual--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--we
would
ask
that
the
case
be
remanded
all
the
way
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
john
g.
holl
the
district
court
should
be
instructed
to
take
into
account
factors
such
as
the
petitioner's--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--the
man
is
at
large
because
he
was
released
under
an
erroneous
standard
of
law.
mr.
john
g.
holl
no.
he
has
an
additional--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--yes.
mr.
john
g.
holl
well,
there
was
a
misunderstanding.
in
the
record
now
before
the
third
circuit,
there
is
a
letter
from
the
new
jersey
parole
board
which
indicates
that
the
petitioner
has
an
additional...
the
respondent
has
an
additional
six
or
seven
months
to
serve
on
his
sentence
should
he
be
sent
back,
should
the
order
of
the
district
court--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--that
was
a
decision,
i'm
sure
there
were
a
number
of
factors
that
went
into
that
decision,
justice
blackmun.
the
state,
i
know,
is
also
pursuing
the
appeal
on
the
carter
case
on
the
merits
before
the
third
circuit.
i
don't
think
it's
been
decided
yet.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
correct.
that's
basically
what
we're
saying.
we're
saying
that
dangerous
is
an
appropriate
factor,
because
in
some
cases
the
state's
case
on
appeal
will
be
more
or
less
substantial,
in
that
range
where
it
should
be
considered
and
also
would
justify
the
weighing
of
the
dangerousness
of
the
prisoner.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
we
do
not
have
in
our
state
a
pretrial--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
holl
yes,
there
is.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
right.
the
issue
is,
does
our
rule
of
bail
after
conviction
apply
to
state
collateral
proceedings.
there
are
no
cases,
but
we
believe
it
does.
mr.
john
g.
holl
the
decision
in
carter
which
estops
a
federal
court
from
considering
these
factors
does
serious
damage
to
comity.
the
state,
when
it
has
a
dangerous
individual,
is
going
to
be
forced,
if
the
federal
courts
are
not
going
to
consider
these
factors,
to
retry
a
dangerous
individual
rather
than
risk
being
released
pending
appeal
if
a
court
won't
take
that
into
account
in
many
cases.
and
therefore,
we
won't
be
able
to
pursue
our
appeal.
if
we
have
to...
if
we
go
back
and
retry
an
individual
under
the
same
kind
of
an
order
that
was
entered
here
by
the
district
court,
then
we
don't
have
a
right
to
appeal.
obviously
we
won't
be
permitted
to
pursue
a
retrial
in
the
state
court
and
a
federal
appeal
at
the
same
time.
this
puts
us
in
a
very
unpleasant
situation.
mr.
john
g.
holl
well,
we've
been
put
in
that
situation.
mr.
john
g.
holl
well,
we
have
not
put
ourselves
in
that
situation.
mr.
john
g.
holl
the
carter
case
eventually
could
get
here.
i
don't
know
whether
it
will.
there
is
a
pending
carter
case,
and
whether
that
issue
remains
a
part
of
it
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
ongoing
carter
case
other
than
that
issue.
mr.
john
g.
holl
i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
g.
holl
i
haven't
seen
anything
in
recent
days
about
the
carter
case.
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
put
itself
in
this
position.
we've
been
put
in
this
position
by
the
order
of
the
federal
district
court,
forcing
us
into,
he
has
to
be
tried
or
he
has
to
be
released.
if
we
want
to
pursue
an
appeal
of
that
decision
because
we
think
it
isn't
a
correct
decision,
then
this
man
will
be
released.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
unclear.
i
think
pursuant...
that
brings
up
the
practice
of
the
issuance
of
conditional
writs
by
the
federal
courts.
the
federal
courts
have
adopted
a
procedure
in
certain
cases
where
they
will
tell
a
state,
this
petitioner
has
to
be
retried
within
a
certain
amount
of
time
or
else
he's
released,
and
we
will
have
the
order
stayed.
so
they
will
not...
so
they
will
tell
the
state
to
retry
this
defendant
and
he
will
remain
incarcerated
because
the
federal
court
will
not
sign
an
order--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--the
federal
court
in
that
case...
he
remains
incarcerated,
because
the
federal
court--
mr.
john
g.
holl
--has
not
ordered
his
release.
that's
why
he's
still
incarcerated.
he's
still
incarcerated
because
a
federal
judge...
this
is
a
common
practice,
this
issuance
of
conditional
writs.
the
federal
courts
will
find
that
the
petitioner
was
denied
a
fair
trial
and
they
will
say
to
the
state:
this
petitioner
has
to
be
retried
within
a
certain
amount
of
time;
if
you
don't,
he
will
be
released.
but
then
they
will
stay
that
order
for
the
state
to
appeal,
and
so
there
will
not
be
in
effect
an
order
of
the
courts
requiring
the
petitioner
to
be
released.
that's
correct,
justice
white.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
john
g.
holl
that's
all
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
holl
yes,
thank
you.
