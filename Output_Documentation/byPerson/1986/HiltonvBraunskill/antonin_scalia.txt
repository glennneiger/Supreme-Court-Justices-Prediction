justice
scalia
well,
why
shouldn't
we
really
know
that
for
a
certainty
before
we
decide
what
the
rule
that
the
federal
court
should
apply
in
this
case?
it
seems
to
me
if
there's
any
interest
in
holding
this
prisoner,
it's
a
state
interest,
not
a
federal
interest,
and
that
if
the
states
would
not...
if
the
state
would
in
fact
let
this
individual
out
pending
appeal
from
a
state
habeas
corpus,
i
see
no
reason
whatever
why
the
federal
court
should
do
otherwise.
justice
scalia
no,
no.
you
mistake
me.
i'm
saying
if
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
itself
would
not
feel
offended
by
a
new
jersey
lower
court
releasing
an
individual
when
the
lower
court
finds
that
he's
entitled
to
state
habeaus,
i
don't
know
why
a
federal
court
should
be
any
more
stingy
with
this
man's
freedom,
because
the
only
interest
in
holding
him
is
a
state
interest.
if
the
state
itself
would
let
him
go,
i
see
no
reason
why
the
federal
court
shouldn't
let
him
go.
so
don't
we
have
to
know
what
the
new
jersey
rule
is?
justice
scalia
he
hasn't
been
convicted
of
a
federal
crime,
right?
he's
been
convicted
of
a
state
crime?
justice
scalia
so
the
only
reason
he
should
be
held
in
prison
at
all
is
a
state
reason,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
take
the
position
that
it
depends
on
federal
law
you're
not
going
to
have...
it's
sort
of
an
erie
question.
you're
not
going
to
have
uniform
application
within
the
state.
if
you
apply
for
state
habeas
corpus
and
the
state
gives
it
to
you,
you're
free
pending
the
appeal.
but
if
you
apply
for
federal
habeas
corpus
and
you
win,
the
federal
court
holds
you.
so
it's
like
erie.
do
you
want
uniformity
within
the
state
or
do
you
want
uniformity
nationwide?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
understand.
even
if
you
decided
to
retry
him,
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
hold
him,
would
you?
you
just
told
me
you
don't
have
any
pretrial
detention.
justice
scalia
only
if
he
can't
make
bail,
i
presume.
i
mean,
you're
not
talking
about...
even
if
you
retry
him,
i
presume
you
would
have
to
release
him
unless
he
could
make
bail
on
the
retrial?
isn't
that
right?
you
told
me
you
don't
have
any
pretrial
detention
in
new
jersey.
justice
scalia
without
bail?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
it
just
as
illogical?
it
seems
to
me
the
rule
you
apply
in
one
situation
you
ought
to
apply
in
the
other.
here
you
have
a
state
that
on
retrial
would
not
have
any
preventive
detention.
what's
the
justification
for
the
holding
that
you
acknowledge
to
be
legitimate
during
the
30
day
conditional
writ
period?
justice
scalia
well,
wait.
a
very
short
reasonable
period.
what
happens
after
the
30
days
expires?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
you're
right
about
the
first
part
of
your
answer.
if
the
30
days
does
not
expire
before
he's
put
back
on
trial,
then
the
conditional
writ
does
not
issue
as
i
understand
it.
the
writ
says:
if
you
are
not
put
on
trial,
then
you've
got
to
release
him.
if
he
is
put
on
trial,
that
in
effect
nullifies
the
force
of
the
writ.
so
he
just
stays
in
jail
as
i
understand
it.
justice
scalia
without
having
to
comply
with
any
bail
requirements.
justice
scalia
why
would
he
need
a
bail
hearing?
no
writ
having
issued,
he's
still--
justice
scalia
why
not
liken
it
instead
to
a
defendant
who
has
been
released
on
state
habeas?
isn't
that
the
most
precise
analogue
in
the
state
system?
justice
scalia
i
don't
care
for
the
moment
what
the
law
is.
all
i'm
asking
is
isn't
that
the
most
precise
analogue
in
the
state
system?
i
mean,
your
argument
is
you
should
be
doing...
you're
furthering
a
state
interest,
you've
said,
and
you
should
be
doing
what
the
state
does.
but
the
closest
analogue
in
the
state
system
is
the
granting
of
state
habeas,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
in
the
state
system,
there's
a
conviction
and
the
defendant
appeals,
the
pretrial
rule
does
not
apply
there?
justice
scalia
yes.
