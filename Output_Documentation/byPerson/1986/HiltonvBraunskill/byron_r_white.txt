justice
white
you're
here
arguing
for
the
state,
i
take
it.
justice
white
and
you
want
to...
you've
convicted
a
person
and
you
don't
want
him
at
large
until
there
is
some
final
ruling
on
the
habeas
corpus.
justice
white
does
new
jersey
have
a
post-conviction
relief
operation?
justice
white
well,
let's
suppose
that
a
convicted
defendant
files
for
state
habeas
or
state
collateral
relief,
and
he
wins
in
the
lower
court
and
then
he's
on
appeal
in
the
state
system.
now,
i
understand
the
state
law
to
be
that
only
flight
is
to
be
considered.
justice
white
so
you
think...
wasn't
there
an
amicus
who
claimed
that
that's
the
rule?
justice
white
oh,
it
does
specifically?
justice
white
dangerousness
and
likelihood
of
success,
and
they
find
this
man
is
very...
they
think
he's
very
dangerous,
but
that
he's
almost
sure
to
win
on
appeal.
what
are
they
supposed
to
do
with
him?
justice
white
well,
it
hasn't
been
finally
decided.
justice
white
but
the
district
court
says,
somebody
says,
very
good
likelihood
of
success
on
appeal.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
that's
what
i
mean,
yes.
justice
white
so
it
really
turns
on
the
likelihood
of
success.
justice
white
but
carter
said
you
can't
consider
that
at
all?
justice
white
oh,
it
isn't?
justice
white
has
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
only
thing
you
can
consider
is
the
likelihood
of
flight?
justice
white
so
that...
when
did
they
say
that?
justice
white
well,
that
excludes
likelihood
of
success.
justice
white
well,
the
dangerousness
then
is
a
red
herring.
justice
white
because
if
there's
a
likelihood
of
success,
you're
going
to...
if
he's
likely
to
prevail
in
the
appellate
court,
he's
going
to
get
out
whether
he's
dangerous
or
not.
and
if
he
hasn't
got
any
likelihood
of
success,
he's
going
to
stay
in
even
if
he
isn't
dangerous.
justice
white
he's
been
released
because
of
the
order
of
the
district
court?
justice
white
i'm
reading
an
amicus
brief.
it
says
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
declared
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
that
the
potential
dangerousness
of
an
accused
defendant
cannot
be
the
basis
for
incarcerating
him
before
trial.
that's
state
against
johnson.
justice
white
but
you
think
the
rule
is
different
once
there's
a
conviction
and
there's
an
appeal?
justice
white
and
that
there's
a
specific
rule
on
that?
justice
white
and
the
only
issue
now
that
is
undecided
is
about
state
collateral?
justice
white
thank
you.
justice
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
issue
a
stay--
justice
white
--based
on
the
fact
that
the
state
may
very
well
prevail
on
appeal?
justice
white
no
what?
the
court
has
no
power
to
do
that?
justice
white
he's
challenging
it
on
appeal.
justice
white
and
he
stays
in
jail.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
real,
anything
wrong
with
saying
that
on
an
appeal
in
the
state
system
from
a
trial
court
order
giving
the
defendant
collateral
relief
and
the
state
appealing,
i
don't
know
that
it's
so
unreasonable
to
say
that
the
rule
that
should
apply
on
enlarging
him
is
the
rule
that
should
apply
on
direct
appeal.
justice
white
well,
is
it
unreasonable
for
a
state
attorney
general
to
say
that's
what
the
rule
ought
to
be?
justice
white
what
if
there
was
case
law
in
new
jersey
that
said
the
rule
on
an
appeal
of
a
collateral
judgment
is
the
rule
that
applies
on
direct
appeal?
then
what
should
a
federal
court
do?
