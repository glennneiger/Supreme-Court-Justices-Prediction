mr.
mark
h.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
although
both
parties
in
this
case
invoke
federalism
and
comity
to
support
their
positions,
their
views
of
what
those
phrases
mean
in
the
context
of
rule
23
could
not
contrast
more
starkly.
the
third
circuit's
opinion
in
carter
versus
rafferty
resolves
the
tension
in
federal-state
relations
that
is
a
necessary
by-product
of
habeas
corpus
litigation
by
construing
rule
23
in
light
of
the
basic
interests
that
habeas
serves,
which
is
the
vindication
of
constitutional
rights,
along
with
the
unquestioned
interest
that
any
court
has
in
seeing
that
parties,
defendants
or
otherwise,
will
be
available
to
answer
to
later
court
judgments,
and
by
leaving
other
purely
state
interests
to
state
courts
themselves
to
resolve
under
state
law,
however
it
may
be
defined.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
to
keep
him
in
prison
during
the
conditional
writ
period?
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
yes.
over
the
years,
that
form
of
stay
has
been
developed
by
the
federal
courts--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--simply
to
give
the
case--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--we
do
not
challenge
the
practice
of
conditional
writs.
we
think
that
the
language
in
rule
23
that
states
that
he
shall
be
released
on
a
surety
unless
the
court
otherwise
orders
refers
to
the
conditional
writs
and
nothing
more.
but
we
do
not
challenge
the
right
to
the
30,
60
days
for
the
state
simply
to
have
a
reasonable
period
of
time
to
make
up
its
mind
of
what
it
is
going
to
do.
now,
if--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--logically,
i
cannot
draw
a
distinction.
it
would
seem
to
me
the
argument
would
apply
to
both.
but
over
the
years
this
practice
has
developed
of
simply
preserving
a
very
short,
reasonable
period.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
certainly
in
many
situations--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--after
the
30
days
expires,
it
depends
on
what
the
state
has
decided
to
do
during
that
30
days.
if
it
has
decided
to
retry
the
defendant
during
the
30
days,
in
answer
to
an
earlier
question,
then
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
lapses
and
he
moves
into
the
state
system
to
be
retried,
at
which
point
he
could
not
be
held.
so
before
the
30
days
if
the
state
moves
to
retry
him,
then
it
is
state
bail
rules
that
would
apply
and
federal
jurisdiction
would
be
divested.
if
they
decide
to
appeal,
then
when
the
30
days
expires
without
a
retrial
carter
would
dictate
he
is
released
on
a
reasonable
surety,
unless--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--for
the
30
days--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--i
apologize
for
a
verbal
mistake.
a
conditional
writ
is
indeed
as
you
said
it
is,
justice
stevens.
it
issues
if
the
30
days
expires.
during
that
period
before
the
writ
expires,
if
the
state
chooses
to
go
to
trial,
it
would
be
our
position,
let's
say
on
the
twenty-fifth
day,
he
would
be
under
state
bail
protection.
in
fact,
the
action
that
would
signal
reinstitution
of
a
state
trial
proceeding
would
be
a
bail
hearing,
during
which,
under
the
new
jersey
constitution,
he
cannot
be
held.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
because
by
taking
the
defendant
back
to
trial,
the
state
has
acknowledged
that
its
conviction
is
no
longer
of
any
force
or
effect.
the
defendant
is
clearly
in
that
situation
in
the
position
of
an
indicted
defendant
facing
trial.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
issue
that
the
state
was
addressing,
in
response
to,
i
believe
it
was,
justice
white's
question--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--that's
right.
and
there
there
is
no
case
law
that
specifically
holds
that
the
rule
involving
post-conviction
bail
applies
to
post-conviction
release.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
are
you
referring
to
the
situation
that
justice
scalia,
i
believe,
referred
to
earlier,
where
the
defendant
is
taken
to
trial
because
the
state
chooses
not
to
appeal,
or
the
situation
where
the
state
chooses
to
appeal
in
the
federal
courts?
because
the
answer
would
be
different.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
answer
would
not
be
different.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
if
the
state
decides
to
take
the
defendant
to
trial,
to
abandon
its
conviction,
then
he
is
now
a
state
indictee
who--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--no,
your
honor.
all
i
can
cite
is
the
new
jersey
constitution.
my
premise
in
that
answer
is--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--there
is
no
decision
that
i'm
aware
of
that
expressly
addresses
the
situation
of
what
happens.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
your
honor,
i
believe
that
applying
the
likelihood
of
success
or
the
rule
8
four
factors,
as
the
state
request
to
do,
to
the
release
decision
would
be
fundamentally
unfair
to
a
defendant
and
would
in
a
case
like
this
one,
particularly
a
short
sentence
case,
would
vitiate
the
writ
itself
and
its
effectiveness.
it
would
damage
the
federal
interest
in
ensuring
that--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--the
status
quo
that
constantly
is
being
referred
to
by
the
petitioners
is
actually
not
the
status
quo,
but
the
status
quo
ante,
as
though
the
judgment
didn't
exist.
consideration
has
to
be
given
to
the
equivalent
federal
interest
that's
shared
by
the
federal
courts
and
the
defendant
in
having
a
writ
issue
that
is
effective.
compare,
if
you
will,
the
situation
in
a
habeas
case
with
the
situation
that
is
normally
provided
under
rule
8,
a
judgment
for
money
or
property,
which
is
the
standard
rule
8
situation.
if
the
appellant
decides
to
take
appeal
after
a
judgment
is
given
to
him,
then
ordinarily
what
happens
is
the
money
or
property
is
secured
by
a
bond.
and
the
reason
that
that
is
done
under
rule
8,
under
rule
44
of
this
court,
under
rule
62
of
the
civil
rules,
is
that
both
parties'
interests
are
protected.
the
appellant
does
not
have
to
come
up
with
the
money
or
property
immediately,
to
damage
his
interests;
and
the
appellee,
if
he
wins
the
case
or
she
wins
the
case
ultimately,
is
assured
of
payment.
try
to
apply
that
to
a
habeas
corpus
situation
involving
a
man's
freedom
and
it
simply
does
not
work.
there
is
no
bond,
there
is
no
supersedeas
bond,
there
is
no
amount
of
money
that
can
replace
freedom
that
is
lost.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
but
as
i
was
indicating,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
entry
of
a
stay
has
to
be
tailored
to
protect
the
interests
of
both
parties.
that
cannot
be
done
if
the
stay
proceeding
is
applied
to
rule
8
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
what
will
inevitably
happen
in
this
case
if
enlargement
was
stayed
was
he
would
have
served
his
entire
unconstitutionally
obtained
sentence
even
if
he
won
the
appeal.
the
compromise
to
be
adopted,
i
would
submit,
is
the
line
taken
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
jago
versus
district
court
of
northern
ohio
and
in
hill
versus
rose,
where
the
rule
8
procedure
was
used
to
stay
the
judgment
ordering
a
retrial
or
holding
a
statute
unconstitutional,
but
where
deference
was
given
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant's
interests
were
not
damaged
because
he
would
be
out.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so,
because
when
the
period
would
end
the
defendant
would
still
be
out
through
a
surety.
it
is
conditional...
his
freedom
is
conditional
or
his
ability
to
be
retried
is
conditional
on
his
winning
the
appeal.
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
same
doctrinal
basis
as
the
conditional
writ.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
i
say
that
the
district
court
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
hold
a
man
because
he
is
dangerous.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
he
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
detain
that
man,
or
he
should
not
have
the
discretion
to
detain
that
man
based
primarily
on
likelihood
of
success,
which
is
apparently
what
the
petitioners
have
shifted
their
focus
to.
on
the
dangerousness
question--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--no,
i
would
say
he
does
not,
or
he
should
not.
if
your
honors
decide
he
has,
then
so
be
it.
but
the
fact
is
he
should
not
have.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--no,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
the
answer--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--should
not
have
the
power
to
do
that,
to
hold
him
for
likelihood
under
rule
23.
as
indicated
in
the
jago
case,
because
to
do
so...
as
i
say,
you
have
to
take--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--this
court,
it
would
seem
to
me,
would
have
the
power
to
stay
if
the
judgment
resulted
in
the
order
releasing
him,
but
not
the
release.
under
rule
23,
those
are
two
separate
tracks.
that
will
be
my
position.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
your
honor,
if--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--what
i'm
trying
to
do
to
discharge
that
burden,
justice
stevens,
is
make
a
distinction
between
the
release
decision
and
the
stay
of
the
underlying
order
that
held
that
the
conviction
was
obtained
unconstitutionally.
i
think
that
the
existence
of
the
rule
does
mean
that
a
stay
of
one
in
a
habeas,
in
a
unique
habeas
situation,
does
not
necessarily
apply
to
the
other,
because
the
defendant's
interest
in
custody,
particularly
in
a
short
sentence
case
like
this,
particularly
in
a
case
where
the
appeal
would
be
going
on
long
after
he
was
released
under
regular
parole
rules
in
new
jersey,
would
mean
that
he
would
have,
if
the
release
decision
was
held
to
be
stayed
as
opposed
to
simply
the
judgment,
he
would
have
no
remedy
at
all.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
it's
a
difficult
distinction
and
it's
an
unusual
one.
but
as
i
say,
courts
have
made
the
distinction.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
well,
i
don't--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--well
then,
your
honor,
if
your
honors
are
to
hold
that
they
can
take
into
consideration
the
release
decision,
i
would
at
least
have
your
honors
consider
the
unique
posture
of
a
habeas
petitioner.
his
burden,
his
position,
is
so
different
from
a
typical
civil
appellant
that
the
distinction
between
the
release
order
and
the
judgment,
which
as
i
say
does
have
precedent
in
cases
like
jaco
and
hill
versus
rose,
is
well
suited
to
the
habeas
context,
because
without
release
from
custody
the
chances
are
he
would
have
no
remedy
whatsoever,
even
if
the
federal
courts,
even
if
this
court
or
the
circuit
courts--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--no,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
where
custody
is
no
longer
in
issue,
then
this
court
has
ruled
that
habeas
can
reach
other
things.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
in
the
real
world,
for
a
defendant
being
held
in
custody
his
remedy
is
what
the
habeas
remedy
has
always
been:
release
from
custody,
at
least
until
his
order
or
the
basis
for
the
order
releasing
him
from
custody
is
reversed
by
a
higher
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
status
quo
that
the
state
is
arguing
from
represents
nothing
more
than
an
absolutely
resolute
and
relentless
attempt
to
ignore
the
fact
that
he
has
received
the
judgment.
and
i
would
ask
your
honor
in
considering
the
question
of
whether
a
stay
that
would
stay
his
release
and
leave
him
to
be
paroled
while
the
appeal
was
still
pending
is
appropriate,
given
the
nature
of
the
habeas
case.
there
is
a
different
track
that
you
can
go
on
that's
fair
to
the
interests
of
both
sides.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
defendant
can
never
get
his
time
back,
but
the
state
can.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
your
honor
has
to
separate
the
dangerousness
component
from
the
likelihood
component
because
they
implicate
very
different
interests.
even
if
your
honors
rule
that
the
federal
courts
have
and
should
have
the
power
to
stay
an
order
of
release
based
on
likelihood
of
success,
the
dangerousness
component
has
to
be
very
strictly
delineated
from
it,
because
the
dangerousness
to
the
community
is
a
purely
state
function
and
it
offends
against
federalism
to
allow
federal
courts
to
be
used
as
means
of
defying...
and
that
is
all
that
they
would
be
used
for...
as
a
means
of
defying
the
judgments
made
by
the
polity
of
the
states,
the
constitution
and
legislatures
and
voters,
that
for
defendants
in
a
situation
similar
to
this
one,
that
he
will
be
held
even
though
no
other
state
inmate
in
a
comparable
situation
can
be
held.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
from
the
practical
and
legal
sense,
we
contend
that
that
is
true,
although
we
would
say
that
if
the
court
decides
to
liken
him
instead
to
a
defendant
on
bail
pending
appeal,
the
same
underlying
bottom
line
holds.
you
still
have
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
he
is
pending
appeal,
but
it
is
the
state's
appeal,
because
his
conviction
no
longer
exists.
it
has
been
found
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
be
fatally
flawed,
hence
of
no
force
and
effect.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
you're
talking
about
state
habeas
by
a
defendant
who
remains
convicted,
getting
back
to
an
earlier
question
that
i
believe
justice
white
asked,
or
a
defendant
who
has
been
given,
been
granted
a
petition
for
post-conviction
relief,
which
is
what
it
is
called
in
new
jersey,
and
the
state
wishes
to
appeal.
there
is
no
case
law
on
the
subject
as
to
what
happens
when
a
state
district
court
judge
grants
a
petition
for
post-conviction
appeal...
sorry...
post-conviction
relief.
but
even
there,
the
precise
analogy--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--perhaps
it
is,
your
honor.
but
we
feel
that
the
logic
of
cases
like
state
against
johnson,
the
logic
of
the
constitutional
provision
in
new
jersey
that
assures
all
defendants
not
convicted
to
be
bailable
on
sureties,
means
that
even
in
that
situation
while
the
appeal
is
pending
the
analogue,
even
the
state
analogue
that
you've
just
described,
is
to
a
pre-trial
defendant.
the
fact
remains
there
is
no
conviction
to
hold
him.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
no,
because
his
conviction
is
valid.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
under
the
rule
in
new
jersey--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--he
is
challenging
it
on
appeal.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
while
his
conviction
is
valid.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
until
an
appellate
court
decides
that
it
is
not.
at
that
point,
we
are,
i
admit,
drifting
on
uncharted
seas
because
we
have
no
new
jersey
appellate
law
that
specifically
says
that.
i
have
the
state's
word
for
it
in
a
footnote
in
their
brief
that
there
is
no
federal
law.
there
is
certainly
no
analogue
in
the
1984
bail
reform
act
that
covers
that
precise
situation.
apparently
there
is
no
case
law.
but
you
have
to
look
again
at
the
state
law.
federalism
requires
that,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
state
like
new
jersey,
where
unconvicted
defendants
are
guaranteed
bail
until
they
are
convicted,
that
a
state
post-conviction
relief
or
a
state
appellate
decision
on
direct
appeal
that
would
vitiate
his
conviction
and
set
him
free--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--it
has.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
all
that
proves,
it
seems
to
me,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
state
judgment
has
gotten
all
the
deference
it
deserves
up
to
the
point
at
which
a
federal
district
court
judge,
a
judge
of
competent
jurisdiction,
no
matter
how
much
the
attorney
general's
representatives
denigrate
that
judgment,
that
the
state
has
been
given
all
the
deference
it
deserves
by
having
the
state
be
the
first
line
of
defense,
if
you
will,
for
the
vindication
of
constitutional
rights.
once
the
case
is
properly
in
the
federal
courts,
than
it
is
certainly
within
the
power...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
the
essence
of
the
power...
of
the
federal
courts
to
disagree
with
the
state
judges
and
indicate
that
there
have
been
constitutional
violations
that
require
his
conviction
be
vitiated.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
well,
your
honor,
again
the
new
jersey
constitution
says
what
it
says.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
state
has
conceded,
if
i
understand
your
question
properly,
that
there
is
no
preventive
detention
in
new
jersey,
except
for
a
convicted
offender.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
i
am
not
entirely
certain,
your
honor,
that
you
can
say
with
absolute
confidence
that
the
state
is
speaking
for
the
state
of
new
jersey
on
this
issue.
the
fact
is
that
the
new
jersey
law
in
this
issue--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--your
honor,
the
attorney
general
is
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
conviction.
he
represents
the
state
of
new
jersey,
i
don't
doubt
that.
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
position
they
are
taking
in
this
court
is
contrary,
i
would
say,
to
the
position
of
the
law
in
new
jersey
on
the
subject
that
we're
discussing.
to
that
extent,
they
differ
from
the
state
law,
and
they
are
asking
federal
courts
to
override
state
law.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
your
honor,
that
would
not
perhaps
be
an
unreasonable
decision
for
state
courts
or
the
state
legislature
to
make.
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
the
point
is
that
the
attorney
general
and
i
both
agree
that
there
is
no
case
law
either
way.
what
i'm
relying
on
is
the
case
law--
mr.
mark
h.
friedman
--the
federal
court
should
do
precisely
what
it
did
in
carter
anyway,
because
the
fact
is
the
federal
court
has
its
own
rules
to
follow.
i
do
not
think
that
what
the
state
court
does
should
affect
what
the
federal
court
does,
because
all
that
proves
is
that
under
certain
situations
the
state
can
handle
the
problem
of
its
defendants
any
way
it
pleases.
and
i
think
that
that
should
certainly
not
affect
whether
or
not
a
federal
court
should
grant
it
in
similar
situations,
since
we
are
talking
about
concurrent
jurisdictions
here.
your
question
raises
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case,
particularly
as
regards
dangerousness.
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
roving
commission
in
either
the
federal
courts
or
the
state
courts
to
sweep
dangerous
people
off
the
streets
wherever
they
find
them.
dangerousness
and
the
determination
of
who
shall
be
held
because
they're
dangerous
follows
the
forms
of
the
law.
the
area
of
preventive
pretrial
detention
or
the
area
of
detention
of
unconvicted
defendants,
whatever
analogue
you
use,
is
a
quintessentially
state
concern,
and
carter
pays
deference
to
that
state
concern
by
allowing
the
states
to
act
on
this
defendant,
who
is
no
longer
subject
to
conviction,
in
any
way
they
please
as
long
as
their
decision
is
constitutional.
and
after
all,
this
court
has
not
determined
whether
preventive
detention
is
unconstitutional
in
any
case.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
hobson's
choice
that
their
positing
because
they
can't
out
a
dangerous
person
away
simply
does
not
exist,
or
if
it
does
exist
it's
because
the
polity,
as
i
said,
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
its
constitution
and
its
voters,
have
determined
that
that's
how
they
wish
to
run
their
affairs
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
the
hobson's
choice
does
not
exist
in
any
case.
there
is
nothing
about
what
the
federal
court
would
do
in
the
release
decision
that
would
prevent
this
appeal
from
going
forward.
and
what
would
simply
happen
is
he
would
be
released
on
a
sufficient
surety.
if
the
state
instead,
as
i
indicated
earlier
to
justice
scalia's
question,
decides
that
they
wish
to
retry
this
person,
then
as
justice
scalia
indicated
earlier,
by
submitting
the
defendant
once
again
to
state
processes
on
retrial,
they
cannot
hold
him.
what
avenue
is
that
out
of
their
hobson's
choice?
the
fact
is
that
the
state's
right
to
appeal
has
ample
protection
in
this
court,
in
the
appellate
court,
regardless
of
what
happens
to
this
defendant
in
terms
of
his
custody.
their
interests
are
protected
in
that
sense.
allowing
the
defendant
to
be
held
while
the
appeal
goes
on
would
do
nothing
more
in
a
case
like
this
one,
where
we've
already
passed
the
first
anniversary
of
this
appeal
in
the
third
circuit,
than
extinguish
the
defendant's
rights
to
an
effective
remedy.
and
the
court
should
pay
some
concern
to
that,
because
certainly
the
state's
interests
that
petitioners
put
forth
as
a
party
litigant
are
amply
protected
without
any
regard
to
rule
23.
in
closing,
your
honors,
we
do
feel
that
the
carter
decision
as
we
have
described
it
serves
the
interests
of
every
party
properly.
it
serves
the
interests
of
this
court,
that
this
court
has
shown
in
federalism
and
comity,
by
allowing
the
states
to
act
within
their
proper
sphere.
it
safeguards
the
rights
of
the
defendant
by
allowing
him
to
have
an
efficacious
remedy
while
the
appeal
is
pending.
and
it
would
do
substantial
justice
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
if
your
honors
intend
to
depart
from
carter,
i
would
submit
it
should
do
by
finding
an
unmistakably
federal
interest
or
one
that
is
related
to
the
federal
role
in
habeas
cases.
since
the
state
has
presented
no
such
interest
here,
in
our
judgment,
since
no
interest
cognizable
by
the
federal
court
could
justify
holding
this
defendant,
whatever
the
test,
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
en
banc
in
refusing
to
grant
a
stay
or
to
reconsider
the
carter
opinion
should
be
affirmed.
if
your
honors
have
no
further
questions.
