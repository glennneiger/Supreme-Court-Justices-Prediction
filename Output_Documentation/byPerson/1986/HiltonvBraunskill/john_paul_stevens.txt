justice
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you
for
a
second
and
ask
you
about
this
particular
case,
prompted
by
justice
blackmun's
question.
as
i
understand,
this
man
is
on
parole
now,
and
he's
already
had
his
habeas
corpus
petition.
he
was
successful
on
the
appeal
on
that,
so
there
obviously
is
likelihood...
was
he
not?
justice
stevens
wasn't
the
writ,
the
issuance
of
the
writ
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
stevens
specifically
what
order
are
we
being
asked
to
review?
is
it
the
en
banc
order
of
the--
third
circuit
refusing
to
grant
a
stay?
justice
stevens
and
the
reasons
for
that
really
are
not
terribly
clear
from
the
order.
the
only
thing
they
really
recite
in
there
is
that
the
motion
was
filed
on
may
16th
and
the
man
is
scheduled
to
be
released
from
custody
on
may
20th,
petition
is
denied.
justice
stevens
so
is
it
not
possible
that
they
denied
the
motion
thinking
that,
since
he's
going
to
be
at
large
anyway,
that
there's
no
point
in
granting
a
stay?
justice
stevens
could
we
reverse
that
now
and
tell
them
they
must
enter
a
stay
at
this
point,
when
the
man's
at
large
on
parole?
justice
stevens
well,
what
relief
can
you
get
in
this
case
from
this
court
now?
justice
stevens
totally
unrelated
to
this
petitioner?
just
you
want
a
general
pronouncement
of
the
law?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
and
he
didn't
give
you
a
stay.
justice
stevens
he
said...
for
one
thing,
he
said,
he
doesn't
really
look
all
that
dangerous,
because
you
misrepresented
his
criminal
record
in
the
district
court.
and
anyway,
and
in
addition,
under
carter
i
couldn't
consider
dangerous
anyway.
justice
stevens
he
didn't
write
an
opinion.
this
was
kind
of
a
colloquy.
and
then
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
say:
well,
he's
going
to
be
released
in
four
days
anyway,
so
we
can't
grant
a
stay.
justice
stevens
so
what
are
we...
i
mean,
what
order
do
you
expect
this
court
to
enter
now?
justice
stevens
and
what
should
the
district
court
do
then?
justice
stevens
for
what
purpose?
the
man's
at
large.
justice
stevens
i
thought
he
has
also
been
paroled.
justice
stevens
mr.
friedman,
before
you
get
into
your
argument
could
i
ask
you
one
sort
of
basic
question.
assuming
the
state
didn't
want
to
appeal
and
the
district
court
entered
one
of
these
30
day
conditional
orders
that
you've
got
to
release
him
if
you
don't
put
him
on
trial
within
30
days,
and
they
do
put
him
on
trial
within
25
days
and
they
keep
him
in
prison
while
they're
doing
this,
do
you
agree
that
the
federal
court
has
power
to
do
that?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
i
understand
it's
quite
common.
justice
stevens
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you
do
not
challenge
that.
justice
stevens
well,
but
if
you
have
power
to
stay
the
order
ordering
release,
that
would
have
the
effect
of
staying
the
release.
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
an
appellate
court
does
have
such
power.
we
do
that
sort
of
thing
all
the
time.
we
think
there's
an
arguably
erroneous
order
entered
by
a
district
court,
when
i
was
on
the
court
of
appeals
we
would
stay
the
order.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
separate
questions
here.
one
is
what
is
the
power
of
the
district
court,
which
is
what
most
people
have
been
talking
about;
the
other
is
what
is
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
it
seems
to
me
really
you
have
a
very
difficult
burden
of
convincing
us
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
have
the
power
to
stay
that
order.
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
there
is
such
a
distinction.
justice
stevens
i
think
it's
a
nonexistent
distinction.
there
is
no
release
decision
apart
from
the
judgment
ordering
release.
that's
what
the
release
decision
is.
you
don't
have
an
abstract
thing,
i
think
you
let
him
out
of
jail.
you
enter
an
order
that
compels
something.
i
just
don't
think
you
can
divide
those
two
into
two
separate
things.
justice
stevens
we
review
orders,
courts
of
appeals
review
orders
entered
by
district
courts.
they
don't...
i
suppose
they
could
enter
an
injunction
against
a
release.
that's
quite
different
from
the
stay
of
an
order.
justice
stevens
well,
that
really
isn't
correct
in
this
case.
he
had
four
more
years
of
parole
to
serve,
didn't
he?
justice
stevens
i
guess
i'm
mixed
up.
and
at
least
he
would
expunge
his
record
from
the
improper
conviction.
that's
not
a
trivial
matter.
justice
stevens
no,
but
you're
arguing
whether
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
and
so
forth.
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
fair
in,
say,
60
percent
of
the
cases.
but
the
question
that
we're
really
asked
is
a
question
of
power,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
district
court
simply
has
no
power
to
enter
a
stay
of
its
own
order
if
he
thinks
the
man
is
terribly
dangerous
and
that
there
is
a
50-50
chance
on
appeal.
justice
stevens
but
that's
on
the
assumption
that,
having
decided
the
writ
should
be
issued,
he
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
person
who
is
presumed
to
be
innocent,
has
never
been
tried.
that's
the
basis
for
your
argument.
