chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
holl,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
the
carter
court
did
not
explicitly
reject--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--likelihood
of
success
on
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
bail
pending
appeal
of
a
direct
conviction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
collateral.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
holl,
are
you
suggesting
that
because
of
the
delicate
relationship
of
the
federal
habeas
procedures
to
state
convictions,
there
might
be
a
federal
interest
apart
from
a
state
interest
in
seeing
that
the
man
is
delivered
over
if
it
were
reversed
on
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
is
in
the
case
where
perhaps
the
state...
where
the
district
court
orders
release
on
habeas,
the
state
has
a
plausible
case
on
appeal
but
not
an
overwhelming
one,
there
a
very
dangerous
habeas
petitioner
probably
should
not
be
released,
one
who
is
not
found
dangerous
probably
should
be
released?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
holl.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
about
the
standard
for
granting
a
stay
by
the
appellate
court,
where
you
also
have,
you
know,
likelihood
of
success
as
a
significant
factor?
it's
not
the
only
one.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
just
making
the
writ
conditional.
that's
the
appellate
court
making
it
conditional.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
a
district
court
finds,
yes,
i'm
going
to
enlarge
this
petitioner
on
habeas.
i
find
that
i'm
not
at
all
sure
what
i
did
is
right;
i
think
there's
a
very
substantial
chance
of
success
on
appeal.
i
think
he's
extremely
dangerous
to
the
community.
you
say
the
district
court
does
not
even
have
the
discretion
to
say
the
guy
doesn't
get
out
on
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
gave
you
a
hypothesis.
is
the
answer,
your
answer,
that
the
district
court
does
not
even
have
the
discretion
to
detain
that
man?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
gave
you
a
hypothesis
that
he
was
found
to
be
very
dangerous,
the
district
court
has
granted
the
habeas,
but
finds
there
is
a
good
deal
of
chance
of
success
on
appeal.
now,
does
the
district
court
in
that
case
have
any
discretion
to
deny
release?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
here
the
conviction
has
been
upheld
all
through
the
new
jersey
courts,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
not
as
if
they
have
thought
there
was
reversible
error
in
the
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
don't
think
it
follows
from
that
that
new
jersey
would
necessarily
insist
that
he
go
free
on
his
appeal
from
the
federal
district
court
habeas
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
state
is
here
speaking
for
new
jersey
and
saying:
we
think
this
fellow
ought
to
be
held.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we've
held
in
certainly
other
cases
that
the
attorney
general
is
presumed
to
speak
for
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
friedman.
mr.
holl,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
you're
waiving
your
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
