they
still
flying

but
at

it
was
a
statement
by
your
court
that
the
state
hadn't
intended
to

how
about
a
gasoline
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
airline
buys
fuel
in
south
dakota,
it
pays...
in
effect,
it's
charged
for
a
tax,
a
fuel
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
the
same
sort
of
tax
that
everybody
else
pays?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
airline...
as
far
as

the

are
the
only
kind
of
personal
property
that
is
subject
to
an
ad
valorem
tax
in
south
dakota?
justice

general,
xxx
on
this
airframe
tax
in
lieu
of
a
gross
receipts
tax
which
we
know
is
invalid.
