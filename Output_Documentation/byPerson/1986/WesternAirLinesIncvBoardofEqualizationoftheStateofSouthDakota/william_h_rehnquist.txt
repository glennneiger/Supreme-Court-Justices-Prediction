chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-732,
western
airlines
versus
board
of
equalization
of
the
state
of
south
dakota.
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready,
mr.
rasenberger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
i
understand
justice
o'connor's
question
and
your
answer,
you
agreed
that
the
term
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
under
your
argument
was
probably
surplusage,
that
it
really
didn't
mean
anything.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
i
understood
justice
o'connor's
point,
and
it
commends
itself
to
me
to
a
certain
extent,
we
don't
ordinarily...
we're
loath
to
say
that
a
proviso
or
a
clause
in
an
act
of
congress
is
just
surplusage,
that
it
really
meant
nothing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rasenberger,
supposing
you
prevail
here.
what
happens
when
this
case
goes
back
on
remand
to
the
south
dakota
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
really,
you
could
argue,
that's
the
tail
wagging
the
dog
the
other
way.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
enforce
the
federal
mandate
here
that
there
should
be
no
discriminatory
taxation
of
airline
or
railroad
property,
a
state
has
to
subject
to
personal
property
tax
all
of
the
personal
property
in
the
state
that
it
had
decided
to
exempt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
south
dakota
were
a
newly
organized
state
and
this
was
the
first
time
they
set
out
to
tax
anybody,
and
they
said:
we're
going
to
tax
all
of
you
people
on
the
traditional
personal
property
tax,
all
of
you
commercial
and
business
people,
but
we're
not
going
to
subject
you
airlines
to
that;
we're
going
to
have
a
special
airlines
tax
for
you,
and
we're
going
to
use
it
all
to
fix
up
airports.
don't
you
think
that
could
be
arguable
a
lieu
tax
under
this
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
but
then
you
would
agree,
i
take
it,
that
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota's
opinion
about
what
a
lieu
tax
was
is
not
entirely
an
accurate
reflection
of
what
congress
meant
by
the
term?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rasenberger.
we'll
hear
next
from
you,
mr.
meierhenry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
meierhenry,
could
you
focus
down
maybe
on
a
specific
example?
supposing
there's
a
south
dakota
intrastate
tour
business
in
the
black
hills
that
has
offices
and
a
fleet
of
buses
that
take
people
through
the
black
hills.
what
sort
of
taxes
do
these
people
pay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
the
airlines
pay
any
gross
receipts
taxes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
in
effect
is
the
intrastate
tour
business
in
the
black
hills,
it's
paying
a
gross
receipts
tax
that
is
probably
as
rough
an
equivalent
or
as
much
of
an
equivalent
as
you
can
say,
as
compared
to
the
airlines
tax
on
the
airframe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
that's
the
principal
way
the
state
gets
money
from
each
of
those
two
businesses,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
it
violate
the
statute
in
a
way
that
this
act
doesn't,
and
if
so
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
meierhenry.
mr.
rasenberger,
do
you
have
any
more?
you
have
two
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rasenberger.
the
case
is
submitted.
