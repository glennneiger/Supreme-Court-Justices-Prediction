justice

you
usually
say
"subject
to
further
order",
just
as
here
it
would
be
more
natural
to
say
"subject
to
property
tax
levy",
rather
than
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
unless
you're
referring
to
a
particular
one
that's
in
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
think
it
means...
what
is
excluded
if
it
does
not
refer
to
a
particular
property
tax?
what
do
you
think
was...
congress
meant
what
could
constitutionally
be
subject
to
a
property
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
commercial
or
industrial
property
wouldn't
constitutionally
be
subject
to
a
property
tax
levy,
commercial
or
industrial
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
i'm
not
saying
not
taxable
in
some
states.
we're
talking
about
congress
using
the
language,
and
you
say
it
doesn't
mean
actually
subject
to.
when
you
say
some
states
have
not
made
it
subject,
you're
using
actually
subject
to,
and
you're
telling
us
that
is
not
what
it
means.
you're
telling
us
it
has
to
mean
constitutionally
it
could
be
subject
to,
and
you
think
that
what
they're
referring
to
is
only
federal
property
that
is
being
used
for
commercial
or
industrial
purposes.
such
as
what?
give
me,
you
know,
five
examples?
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
facilities?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
pretty
fine
line
to
draw
in
a
statute
that
you
tell
us
was
sort
of
thrown
together.
i
mean,
you
say
congress
was
being
so
precise
that
they
thought,
well,
there
is
some
little
bit
of
commercial
and
industrial
property
that
can't
be
taxed,
namely
federal
facilities.
i
would
never
have
thought
of
that,
but
you
told
me
that
this
was
a
pretty
much
rush
job,
this
statute.
that's
fairly
refined,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
congress
wanted
to
leave
to
states
the
availability
of
treating
some
commercial
and
industrial
property
specially
and
not
subjecting
them
to
a
tax
levy
at
all,
such
as
in
order
to
attract
new
business
or
something
of
that
sort.
isn't
that
a
possibility
that
congress
could
have
had
in
mind?
as
you
would
have
us
read
the
statute,
no
state
could
give
an
exemption
or
a
lower
rate
in
order
to
attract
new
commercial
enterprise
within
the
state,
without
at
the
same
time
applying
that
new
rate
to
interstate
airlines.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
isn't
that
a
good
reason
for
congress
conceivably
making
that
exception,
that
it's
only
property
that
is
actually
subject
to
a
levy
that
we've
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
the
provision
that
applied
to
railroads,
which
did
explicitly
prohibit
all
other
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
in
effect,
does
not
exist
with
respect
to
airlines?
i
mean,
your
argument
would
have
a
lot
more
force,
you
know,
if
you
come
and
say
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
meant
to
prohibit
just
one
type
of
discrimination,
but
didn't
intend
to
prohibit
the
other.
now,
with
railroads
you
could
say
that,
because
they
had
a
provision,
a
general
provision
that
said
all
other
discrimination
is
prohibited.
that
was
dropped
for
airlines.
why
was
it
dropped?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
indicates
that
it
doesn't
have
to
replace
another
tax;
it's
enough
if
it's
a
tax
that
adjusts
for
the
fact
that
you
don't
pay
another
one.
for
example,
many
states
have
taxes
that
require
you
to
pay
an
additional
personal
property
tax
on
automobiles
that
you
buy
in
another
state,
because
you
don't
pay
any
sales
tax
within
the
home
state
on
that.
i
think
that
would
probably
be
called
an
in
lieu
tax.
in
lieu
of
paying
the
sales
tax,
if
you
bought
it
locally,
you
can
buy
it
in
another
state
and
pay
a
personal...
an
additional
personal
property
tax.
wouldn't
you
consider
that
an
in
lieu
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go,
can
i
ask
one
other
question.
you
stated
earlier
in
the
response
to
either
my
question
or
one
of
the
other
justices
that,
in
the
situation
where
a
state
gives
a
special
tax
break
to
a
business
to
come
in,
a
lower
rate
or
a
lower
assessment,
whatever,
what
would
their
obligation
be
under
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
interstate
airlines?
you
said
that
they
would
have
to
try
to
average--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
average
rate
applied
to
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean?
you
would
take
an
average
of
the
special
tax
rate
and
everybody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
meierhenry,
suppose
your
legislature,
when
it
enacts
a
tax,
says
we
do
not...
this
is
not
an
in
lieu
tax,
we're
not
adopting
this
in
order
to
replace
something
else,
we
just
want
to
tax
this
business,
and
it
says
that
in
the
statute.
could
we
find
that
to
be
an
in
lieu
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
causes
a
tax
to
be
in
lieu
unless
the
fact
that
it
is
imposed
in
lieu
of
something
else?
and
whether
it
is
imposed
in
lieu
of
something
else
certainly
depends
upon
the
imposer,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
maybe
that's
why
you
didn't
appeal
the
determination.
what
is
it
in
lieu
of?
if
the
legislature
can
say
it
determinatively,
certainly
the
supreme
court
can,
can't
it,
of
your
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
does
that
matter?
you've
made
a
lot
of
the
fact
that
you're
using
the
kind
of
a
formula
that
this
court
has
approved
in
the
past
and
that
it
yields
only
$200,000.
but
if
we
rule
the
way
you
want
us
to
today,
there's
no
reason
you
couldn't
kick
that
up
to
$200
million.
as
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
there's
nothing
that
would
prevent
you
from
using
the
same
ratio...
i
mean,
you
can
only
tax
a
certain
proportion
under
our
earlier
decisions
of
the
value
of
those
aircraft.
but
you
could
tax
them
at
whatever
rate
you
want,
you're
telling
us.
so
even
though
you're
only
deriving
$200,000
this
year,
next
year
it
could
be
$200
million.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
maximum
assessment,
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
you
can
apply
a
300
percent
rate
to
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
lucky
for
the
federal
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
real
estate
do
the
airlines
own
that
they
pay
taxes
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
that
they
have
any
specific
piece?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure.
that's
very
nice
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
other
state
that
has
a
tax
structure
like
this
which
happens
to
have
no
property
tax
and
would
be
able
to
impose
this
kind
of
a
system?
how
many
other
states
have
that?
