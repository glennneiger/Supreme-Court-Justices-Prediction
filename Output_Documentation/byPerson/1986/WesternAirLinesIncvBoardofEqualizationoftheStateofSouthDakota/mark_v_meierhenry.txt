mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
not
talking
here
today
about
a
new
tax.
the
tax
that
south
dakota
imposes
on
airlines
has
been
in
place
since
1961.
and
since
1961,
the
state
of
south
dakota
has
only
taxed
aircraft,
and
i
want
to
make
that
clear
to
the
court.
we
don't
tax
the
trucks
that
service
the
airplanes,
we
don't
tax
whatever
equipment
they
have
in
their
office.
we
only
tax
the
airframes.
where
did
the
south
dakota
tax
come
from?
it
came
from
and
can
best
be
explained,
i
think,
from
a
decision
of
this
court,
braniff
airlines
versus
the
nebraska
state
board.
if
you
will
harken
back
to
that
case,
you
will
find
our
tax
scheme,
wherein
we
use
a
ratio
of
how
much
the
airplane
is
actually
used
in
south
dakota,
together
with
revenue
miles
and
other
factors.
that
scheme
of
taxation
was
approved
by
this
court
and
justice
reed
wrote
that
it
was
a
proper
tax
on
interstate
commerce
at
that
time.
since
1961,
although
other
business
and
commercial
property
paid
personal
property
taxes
in
south
dakota,
up
until
1979
the
airlines
did
not.
when
we
imposed
this
tax
on
the
airframes,
the
aircraft
themselves,
we
specifically
exempted
airline
companies
from
other
taxes.
and
i
think
my
colleague
misspoke
himself
when
he
said
private
aircraft
is
not
subject
to
tax.
as
an
aircraft
owner,
i
can
tell
you
it
is.
if
you
live
in
south
dakota
and
you
buy
an
airplane,
you
pay
a
four
percent
use
tax
on
the
purchase
price
of
the
airplane.
as
an
airman
in
south
dakota,
i
pay
an
annual
fee.
we
have
a
statute--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes,
it
would,
if
i
were
a
resident
of
south
dakota,
four
percent.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
paid
only
one
time,
justice.
what
i'm
saying
is
we
have
a
statute
that
specifically
exempts
those
businesses
in
interstate
commerce,
and
so
i
wanted
to
make
clear
that
this
tax
was
impacted
by
the
passage
in
1982
of
the
federal
law.
but
it
is
not
as
if
we
passed
the
tax
afterward.
we
had
it
in
place.
and
we
all
recognize
that
airlines
are
a
unique
business.
they're
not
the
normal
business.
they're
not
like
railroads,
which
have
miles
and
miles
of
real
estate
in
the
state
which
is
taxed.
so
when
south
dakota
took
off
or
repealed
the
personal
property
tax
on
other
commercial
and
business
property,
the
personal
property
side
of
it...
there
are
other
taxes.
the
history
of
our
state
will
reveal
at
that
time
we
were
broadening
the
sale
tax
and
the
use
tax
to
other
businesses,
meanwhile
repealing
the
personal
property
tax.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
the
thrust
of
the
legislation,
if
i
could
be
so
bold
as
to
put
it
in
a
sentence,
was
not
to
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
and
not
to
penalize
in
any
way
companies,
like
airlines,
that
operate
interstate.
and
we
are
talking
here
today
about
a
tax
that
raises
totally,
from
all
the
airlines
in
the
state
of
south
dakota,
about
$200,000
a
year.
the
result
if
this
particular
tax
is
struck
down
is
we
will
collect
zero.
now,
if
we
collect
zero
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
we
are
not
harming
the
airlines,
if
we
collect
no
tax.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
follow
through
in
1315(d),
where
it
makes
clear
that
states
can
have
property
taxes
on
interstate
carriers.
it
also
says
they
can
have
net
income
taxes.
south
dakota
doesn't
have
an
income
tax.
they
can
have
franchise
taxes.
we
chose
not
to
do
that,
because
it
is
most
fair,
as
our
brief
points
out,
and
we
try
to
be
fair
to
airlines.
what
the
airlines
say
is
that,
because
we
have
attempted
to
be
fair
to
the
airlines
and
we
have
arranged
a
scheme
that
was
in
effect
25
years
unchallenged,
that
this
congressional
legislation
immediately
struck
it
down.
but
yet,
what
are
the
meaning...
when
they
define
"subject
to
a
property
tax",
can
we
assume,
as
courts
have
in
other
cases,
that
congress
was
aware
of
our
tax?
after
all,
justice
o'connor,
we
followed
the
model
that
was
put
into
effect,
recognized
by
this
court,
by
the
then
civil
aeronautics
board.
it
was
the
typical
type
of
tax
across
the
united
states.
i
saw
nothing
that
specifically
said
in
the
legislative
history
they
wanted
to
strike
down
this
type
of
fair
tax.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
our
trial
court,
as
you're
aware,
found
that
it
was
an
in
lieu
tax
and
our
supreme
court
did
not.
in
reading
some
of
the
prior
cases
about
appeals
and
cross-appeals
and
the
procedure,
i
guess
it's
our
feeling
that
if
you
wish
to
define
under
the
federal
law
that
it's
an
in
lieu
tax,
we
would
willingly
accept
it
and
we
think
that--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no,
we
have
not,
because
it
was--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
it
was
our
feeling
that
we
had
to
take
this
case
up
under
what
our
south
dakota
supreme
court's
definition
of
in
lieu
tax
was,
and
so
we
have
done
it
that
way,
hoping
that
if
we
were
incorrect
this
court
would
correct
that
ruling
by
our
court.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that's
true,
your
honor,
because
part
of
the
problem
here
is
this
was
the
initial
approach
at
taxation
of
the
airlines.
see,
when
we
passed
this
tax
in
1961,
we
also
allowed
the
counties
where
the
airlines
had
their
receiving
facilities
to
tax
the
other
personal
property,
and
just
the
aircraft
was
centrally
taxed
and
they
would
tax
the
items.
when
we
continued
this
tax,
we
took
off
the
personal
property
totally,
and
so
it
remained
only
centrally
assessed,
as
are
utilities,
railroads,
and
other
factors.
so
when
this
federal
statute
came
into
effect,
it
really
was
as
a
result
of
this
federal
statute
that
the
airlines
have
challenged
it.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
yes,
i
think
you
can.
i
think
this
court--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
believe
it
does,
justice.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it's
in
lieu
of
every
other
tax.
this
is
the
only
tax--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--but
it
is
true.
this
is
the
only
tax
collected
from
any
airline,
directly
from
them.
and
as
was
mentioned
before--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no,
sir,
they
are
not
taxed.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
we
do
not
tax
them.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
not
in
excess
of
perhaps
$35.
a
license
fee,
you
mean
to
license?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
would
be
the
only
other
tax.
but
i
guess
as
i
stand
here
i
don't
recall
whether,
as
long
as
they're
used
on
the
airport
facilities,
whether
they'd
be
required
to
be
licensed.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
airlines
in
south
dakota
all
use
public
facilities.
they're
all
publicly
owned
airports
of
one
sort,
either
by
the
city
or
the
county.
and
the
income
from
the
airports
is
from
airline
rent,
landing
fees,
property
taxes
of
the
taxing
district,
and
so
forth.
the
only
taxes
collected
directly
from
the
airlines
of
any
property
tax
nature
is
by
the
central
assessment
of
the
airframes
or
the
airplanes
themselves.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
none.
we
have
none
in
south
dakota.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
not
in
south
dakota.
and
we
have
no
income
tax,
so
they
aren't
taxed
that
way.
of
the
money,
the
$200,000
approximately
received
from
the
airlines--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes,
they
pay
landing
fees.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
rent,
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
there's
a
big
difference
between
a
fee
and
a
tax.
inasmuch
as
the
airline...
the
airport
property
itself
is
not
on
the
tax
roll
because
it's
publicly
owned,
a
part
of
their
rent
certainly
does
not
include
that
portion
that
a
normal
landlord
would
pay
in
taxes
to
the
county.
so
what
they
pay
rent
for
is
the
facility,
the
building,
the
runways,
all
these
things,
to
operate
their
business.
and
to
answer
one
of
the
justices'
questions,
continental's
coming
back
november
8th,
and
that
is
the
nature
of
the
airline
business
today
now
that
it's
unregulated.
they
come
and
go
out
of
our
state,
and
we
have
this
huge
facility
waiting
to
serve
their
business
purpose,
which
they
now
can
load
all
their
equipment
up
on
the
last
plane
out
of
town
and
we
as
a
state
have
nothing.
so
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
our
tax
structure,
it's
even
more
fair.
it's
only
when
they
do
business
in
our
state
that
they
pay
the
tax,
according
to
the
amount
of
business
they
do.
and
so
the
whole
purpose
of
the
rrrr
act
was
to
stop
discrimination,
and
we
have
taken
note
of
that
in
our
state.
and
we
put
into
our
brief
and
attempted
to
show
this
court
that
as
a
state
we
have
ceased
the
discriminatory
practices
that
many
states
have
used
against
interstate
carriers,
and
that's
why
those
cases
are
there.
our
supreme
court
has
told
the
state
and
the
counties
and
everybody
that
taxes,
we
must
be
fair.
we
have
followed
the
dictates
of
this
court
and
we
have
not
discriminated
against
interstate
commerce.
and
yet,
here
we're
faced
today
with
a
case,
because
of
the
passage
of
a
statute,
that
says
$200,000
by
all
the
airlines
is
discriminatory.
that's
all
we
pay,
but
it's
too
much.
and
if
we
come
back
and
we
enact
a
new
tax
that's
a
use
tax,
and
because
their
business
is
so
unique,
how
can
we
come
up
with
a
use
tax
that
they
won't
be
back
here
six
years
from
now
saying,
you're
taxing
us
differently
than
all
these
other
businesses
that
are
there,
that
own
real
estate,
that
have
a
plant
and
equipment,
all
of
which
would
pay
four
percent
use
tax,
all
of
which
pay
gross
receipts
taxes.
congress
has
exempted
them
from
the
gross
receipts
tax.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
intrastate,
in
the
state?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
they
pay
a
four
percent
gross
receipts
tax.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
congress
has...
the
aloha
case
has
told
us
we
cannot
do
that.
and
we
have
never
taxed
them
on
their
gross
receipts.
we
call
it
a
sales
tax,
but
it
is
technically
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
business.
so
they
would
pay
a
sales
tax.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
they
would
pay
the
normal
registration
fees
for
a
bus,
which
are
very
minimal.
it's
not
a
tax
on
vehicles
in
south
dakota.
the
maximum
registration
fee
for
an
automobile
is
$35,
so
it's
a
registration
fee.
they
would
pay
that,
if
you
want
to
call
it
a
tax.
i
don't.
they
would
pay
real
estate
property
taxes
if
they
had
a
garage.
the
airlines
have
no
real
estate
that
i'm
aware
of
in
south
dakota.
those
are
the
main
taxes
they
would
pay.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
motor
fuels
tax
in
south
dakota.
so
to
speak,
the
bus
company
nor
the
airlines
pay
it.
the
petroleum
dealer
pays
it.
in
the
case
where--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes,
all
of
which
under
a
statute--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes.
it's
non-discriminatory.
and
it
is
all
devoted
to
airport
use.
all
the
aviation
fuel,
the
petroleum
dealer
pays
a
tax,
but
it
is
dedicated
to
airport
use.
on
the
bus
company
example,
it's
all
donated--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
correct.
our
statute,
s.d.c.l.
10-46-10,
exempts
all
property
used
to
repair,
maintain,
equip
vehicles
in
interstate
commerce,
and
that's
been
the
law
since
1961,
when
we
made
it
very
clear
only
the
aircraft
will
be
taxed,
and
only
according
to
a
ratio
almost
exactly
like
that
approved
by
this
court
in
the
braniff
airlines
case.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
oh,
far
higher.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
yes,
the
principal
way
we
would
get
money
from
a
business
within
the
state
would
be
the
gross
receipts
tax,
which
is
four
percent
off
the
top.
in
the
case
of
the
airlines,
that's
the
federal
tax
which
they've
preempted
the
states.
that's
the
eight
percent.
and
really,
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record,
but
i
happen
to
know,
less
than
six
percent
of
most
of
the
operating
money
of
any
of
our
airports
comes
from
this
tax.
it's
a
minimal
amount
per
year,
$200,000.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
suppose
we
could.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
that
is
of
course
this
court's
duty,
and
i
know
a
heavy
responsibility,
to
determine
this
statute.
but
i
read
it
a
little
differently,
justice.
i
think
congress
had
to
recognize
there
is
50
states
and
a
number
of
territories,
and
that
they
could
not
sit
here...
and,
even
though,
as
my
colleague
said,
it
took
15
years
to
pass
this
statute,
there
is
unique
ways
to
have
all
kinds
of
taxes.
and
i
think
they
wanted
to
allow
us
some
latitude
down
here
at
the
bottom
out
in
south
dakota.
and
when
they
said
if...
when
it
says
in
the
definitional
section
"devoted
to
a
commercial
or
industrial
use.
"
and
then
they
added
these
words,
"and
subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
they
recognized
that
if
you
in
fact
are
going
to
tax
this
property,
you
have
to
do
it
fairly.
we
have
a
statute
that
says
we
use
the
average
of
all
property.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
other
than
other
utilities.
no
personal
property,
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
on
its
face
it
has
to
be
subject
to
a
property
tax
before
you
go
up
to
the
ratio.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that's
right.
and
the
only
property
in
this
particular
class
happens
to
be
airline
property.
but
the
saving
part
of
our
statute
i
believe
is
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
challenged
in
25
years
as
being
discriminatory
because
we
used
an
average
of
all
other
property.
and
so
we
have
been
fair,
is
what
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court.
we
haven't
overassessed
these
airlines.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
it's
because
of
the
whole
way
we
come
up
with
the
ratio.
first
of
all,
it
would
be
a
burdensome
act
and
it
would
be
a
discriminatory
act,
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
all
of
this
statute,
and
we
wouldn't
do
it.
and
if
we
did
it,
they
could
clearly
show
that
it
would
be
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
because
we
would
have
to
change
how
we
come
up
with...
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
two
different
ratios,
in
effect,
because
our
statute
now
requires
us
to
take
a
ratio
of
the
ton-miles
they
operate
in
our
state,
the
flight
time,
and
the
total
tonnage
boarded
and
unloaded.
we
come
up
with
the
ratio.
they
provide
that
information
for
us.
then
we
come
up
with
the
value
of
the
plane.
once
we
come
up
with
the
value
of
the
planes,
we
then
assess
them,
and
we
have
a
maximum
levy
that
affects
everybody
in
the
state,
maximum
assessment.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
all
right.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no.
we
can
only
use
the
average
mill
levy
on
all
property
within
the
state.
that's
real
and
personal,
all
property.
so
we
can't.
and
historically,
we
can't
go
out
and
raise
our
mill
rate
on
our
citizens.
we'd
have
to
change
the
law,
we'd
have
to
change
the
constitution.
but
assume
we
did,
to
come
up
with
your
example
we'd
have
to
raise
that
mill
levy
so
high
that...
well,
it
couldn't
be
done.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
it
would
violate--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
as
a
matter...
but
the
federal
law
also,
the
purpose
of
the
rrrr
act
was
to
stop
states
from
going
overboard.
and
i
guess
when
you
interpret
this
statute,
inasmuch
as
our
statute
was
in
place
before
the
federal
statute,
you
still
must
go
back
and
see
whether
it's
burdensome,
because
property
taxes
are
allowed
and
we
have
a
property
tax.
we
have
a
unique
industry.
we
have
a
unique
way
of
doing
business.
and
the
first
question
we
must
ask
is,
are
they
burdensome.
now,
when--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
we
do.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
section
(b)
of
1513
allows
the
property
tax.
section
(b)
is
for
this
court
to
interpret
where
the
words
"devoted
to
a
commercial
or
industrial
use
and
subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
did
congress
intend
to
take
away
all
the
unique
methods
of
taxation
across
the
country,
and
did
they
intend
that
only
the
slots
that
we
have
discussed
today
are
the
only
methods,
because
in
south
dakota
we
did
change
our
method
of
taxation
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
statute.
we
had
always
taxed
airlines
and
we
do
today
the
same
as
we
did,
only
on
their
aircraft,
not
on
their
personal
property.
yet
today
my
colleague
would
have
us
talk
about
the
fact
that
we
took
away
the
personal
property
tax
levy.
but
they
were
never
part
of
it,
justice.
they
were
never
part
of
the
personal
property
tax
levy.
they
were
part
of
the
other
type
of
tax
that
we
had
imposed
upon
them.
so
the
fact
that
we
have
no
commercial
or
industrial
personal
property
today,
we
didn't
in
1961
or
'71...
or
i
should
say,
they
didn't
pay
any
personal
property
tax.
so
when
we
eliminated
the
personal
property
tax
levy,
it
really
never
affected
the
airlines.
now
they're
coming
in
here
today
under
1513
and
saying:
aha,
we've
got
you,
because
if
we
win
this
case...
and
i
think
we
all
know
who
else
are
amicus
on
this...
if
we
win
this
case,
we
don't
have
to
pay
any
tax,
because
as
the
attorney
general
of
south
dakota
i
can't
figure
out
how
we'll
be
able
to
fashion
a
tax
that
ever
gets
to
the
uniqueness
of
interstate
carriers.
just
as
today
the
personal
property
of
railroads
is
not
taxable
in
south
dakota,
just
their
real
property.
and
i
think
it's
important
in
construing
the
statute
to
look
at
that.
in
closing,
i
would
only
like
to
say
that,
as
was
pointed
out
by
this
court,
we
have
frequently
reiterated
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
immunize
interstate
instrumentalities
from
all
state
taxation,
but
that
such
commerce
may
be
required
to
pay
a
non-discriminatory
share
of
the
tax
burden.
we
believe
that
our
south
dakota
tax
is
a
non-discriminatory
share
of
the
tax
burden,
and
it
fits
within
1513
as
a
fair
and
equitable
way
to
collect
a
very,
very
small
share
of
the
tax
burden
from
the
airlines
in
south
dakota.
thank
you.
