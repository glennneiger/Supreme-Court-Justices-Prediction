justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
please,
on
the
in
lieu
tax.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
proceeds
of
this
tax
are
used
entirely
for
airport
and
aeronautical
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
not
possible
that
congress,
what
congress
was
saying
is
that
if
you're
using...
if
you're
going
to
tax
airlines
for
general
revenue
purposes,
then
you've
got
to
treat
them
like
others
who
are
being
taxed
for
general
revenue
purposes,
but
if
you're
going
to
just
raise
money
for
airports
and
aeronautical
purposes
it's
fair
to
impose
the
entire
tax
on
the
airlines?
wouldn't
that
make
sense
out
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
the
only
tax
at
issue
here,
is
the
one
that
the
trial
court
thought
was
an
in
lieu
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
aren't
charging
other
commercial
and
industrial
purposes
this
same
tax.
so
you're
being
excused
to
the
same
extent
that
other
commerce
and
industry
is
excused.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
apply
to
tax
that's
used
solely
for
aeronautical,
and
that's
what
this
one
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
and
another
question:
why
is
not
the
in
lieu
issue
before
us?
because
if
we
disagreed
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
that
issue,
we
could
affirm
their
judgment
on
a
different
ground.
so
i
think
that
issue
is
open
to
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
see,
our
job
is
to
try
and
make
sense
out
of
the
entire
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you're
being
very
literal
here,
because
the
words
"in
lieu
can't
be
the
first
tax,
can't
be...
you're
saying
it's
got
to
replace
something
that
previously
existed.
"
"and
now
you're
the
one
who's
being
the
very
literal
reader
of
the
statute.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
you
ran
a
business
and
you
used
your
airplane
in
your
business,
would
that
tax
then
be
subject--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
commercial
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
meierhenry,
can
i
take
xx
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute
for
a
minute
and
suggest
to
you
that,
just
reading
the
statute
literally,
you
probably
can't
collect
this
tax,
because
as
i
understand
your
argument
the
definitional
section,
"subject
to
a
property
tax",
really
has
the
effect
of
taking...
saying
these
is
no
commercial
and
industrial
property
within
the
assessment
jurisdiction.
there
just
isn't
any
by
statutory
definition.
and
therefore,
the
ratio
of
the
true
value
of
that
property,
whatever
it
may
be,
to
the
assessed
value,
is
zero.
and
if
you
can't
tax
over
the
rate
of
zero,
you
can't
tax
these
airlines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
but
the
effect
of
what
you've
done
is
to
remove
all
of
the
commercial
and
industrial
property
in
the
state
from
the
statutory
definition
by
not
imposing
a
property
tax
on
it.
isn't
that
right?
there
is
no...
there
is
no
centrally
assessed
commercial
and
airline
property
in
the
state
of
south
dakota.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that's
true,
then
your
ratio
to
market
value
is
zero
times
market
value,
which
produces
zero,
which
would
mean
you
can't
tax
above
a
zero
rate
if
you
just
read
the
statute
on
its
plain
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
get
out
of
the
zero
category.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
on
that
point,
if
i
may
add,
isn't
it
true
that
with
respect
to
all
other
taxes
the
revenues
derived
by
those
taxes
go
into
the
general
revenue
of
the
state,
whereas
this
is
the
only
tax
where
the
money
is
earmarked
for
airport
use?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
makes
some
difference
in
the
language,
in
the
definition
of
in
lieu
tax.
