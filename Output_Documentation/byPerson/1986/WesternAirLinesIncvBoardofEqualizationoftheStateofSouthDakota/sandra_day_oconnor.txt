justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
rasenberger,
at
the
time
that
the
language
referred
to
all
property,
wasn't
traditionally
exempt
property
already
excluded
from
all
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
charitable
property
wasn't
being
taxed
at
that
time,
or
federal
owned,
or
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly,
just
pure
surplusage,
on
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
kind
of
a
curious
argument,
because
usually
we
think
when
congress
adds
new
language
like
that
it
must
be
intended
to
mean
something,
and
on
your
interpretation
it
wouldn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
adds
language,
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
on
that
point,
there
is,
of
course,
a
statutory
exception
for
an
in
lieu
tax
which
is
used
for
airport
and
aeronautical
purposes.
in
a
very
curious
holding,
the
court
below
said
this
was
not
an
in
lieu
tax.
now,
apparently
no
appeal
was
brought
to
us
on
that.
that
isn't
raised
by
the
state,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
suppose
whether
it
is
or
is
not
is
a
matter
of
federal
definition,
though,
ultimately?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whether
it's
an
in
lieu
tax.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
it
doesn't,
but
i'm
also
suggesting
that
certainly
in
this
situation
it's
very
possible
that
a
state
could
indeed
single
out
airlines
for
tax
under
this
in
lieu
exemption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
maybe
"in
lieu"
means
that
it's
not
an
additional
tax,
but
the
only
tax
of
a
particular
type.
and
the
point
is
it
may
have...
that
term
may
have
a
federal
definition,
not
a
state
definition.
the
state
court
makes
it
turn
on
the
historical
accident
of
whether
there
was
a
previous
tax,
and
maybe
that
isn't
the
meaning
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
general
meierhenry,
certainly
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
shows
a
legislative
intent
to
prevent
the
state
from
taxing
airlines
or,
in
the
case
of
railroads,
railroads
for
ad
valorem
property
tax
purposes
at
a
higher
rate
and
putting
them
in
a
separate
classification.
and
that's
the
thrust
of
the
bill,
and
your
argument
certainly
goes
counter
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
state
imposed
a
very
small
ad
valorem
property
tax
on
private
aircraft,
for
example,
instead
of
none,
the
result
here
would
have
to
be
that
the
airlines
could
not
be
charged
more
than
that,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
because
the
state
charges
zero
ad
valorem
property
taxes
against
private
aircraft
and
other
property,
the
result
you
argue
for
is
that
the
tax
stands.
and
it
just
is
kind
of
an
odd
result.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
also
ask
you
why
you
dropped
the
in
lieu
argument
on
your
response
in
the
appeal
in
this
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
didn't
make
that
argument,
certainly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
wondered
why.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
question
we
have
to
ask.
i
thought
we
had
to
ask
the
question
whether
it
violated
this
particular
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
case
western
airlines
versus
the
board
of
equalization
comes
to
the
court
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota.
it
involves
the
south
dakota
airline
flight
property
tax.
the
south
dakota
tax
is
imposed
on
air
carriers
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
aircraft.
state
law
requires
that
the
proceeds
of
the
tax
be
allocated
to
the
airports
used
by
the
carriers
and
to
be
used
exclusively
for
airport
purposes.
appellants,
four
airline
companies
operating
in
south
dakota,
paid
their
flight
property
taxes
for
the
year
and
question
under
protest
and
unsuccessfully
sought
refunds
in
state
court.
appellants
argued
that
the
taxation
of
flight
property
when
most
other
personal
property
was
exempt
from
taxation,
violated
the
federal
airport
and
airway
improvement
act
of
1982,
which
prohibits
the
imposition
of
discriminatory
state
or
local
taxes
on
air
carriers.
the
lawsuits
were
consolidated
for
review
in
the
north
dakota
circuit
court
and
that
court
held
that
the
south
dakota
flight
property
tax
was
an
in
lieu
tax
which
was
fully
utilized
for
airport
and
aeronautical
purposes,
and
therefore
exempt
by
federal
law
from
the
antidiscrimination
provisions.
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
disagreed
with
the
holding
but
affirmed
on
an
alternative
ground.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
for
a
unanimous
court
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
and
hold
that
the
south
dakota
air
flight
property
tax
is
an
in
lieu
tax,
which
is
wholly
utilized
for
airport
and
aeronautical
purposes
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
act,
and
therefore
not
in
violation
of
it.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
