mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
south
dakota
airline
flight
property
tax
discriminates
against
airlines
in
violation
of
49
u.s.c.
1513(d).
that
section
in
a
nutshell
prohibits
states
from
assessing
or
from
taxing
air
carrier
property
at
a
higher
rate
than
commercial
and
industrial
property
in
the
same
jurisdiction.
now,
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
has
held
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
statute,
even
though
almost
no
other
property,
personal
property
in
south
dakota,
is
taxed
except
the
property
of
airlines.
indeed,
property
that
is
not
taxed
includes
aircraft
that's
privately
owned,
it
includes
corporate
aircraft,
it
includes
aircraft
used
in
charter
services,
it
includes
even
aircraft
used
in
interstate
air
service.
only
the
aircraft
of
interstate
airlines
or
those
in
foreign
commerce
is
taxed
in
south
dakota.
and
needless
to
say,
no
competing
modes
of
transportation
are
taxed
insofar
as
their
personal
property
is
concerned,
such
as
buses
or
taxis
or
rental
cars.
now,
the
state
doesn't
deny
that
its
system
is
discriminatory
and
the
state
agrees,
as
i
understand
them,
that
the
purpose
of
1513(d)
is
to
prevent
discrimination.
and
the
state
also
admits
that,
if
it
taxed
other
commercial
and
industrial
property
in
the
state,
the
assessment
ratios
and
the
tax
rates
could
not
be
any
lower
for
that
property
than
for
air
carrier
property.
but
the
state
says
the
kind
of
discrimination
it's
practicing
in
this
case
is
permitted
by
the
statute
because
it's
exempting
all
other
property
from
taxation,
rather
than
taxing
it
at
a
lower
rate.
now,
the
south
dakota
court
has
reached
that
conclusion
based
on
a
reading
of
1513(d)
which
it
says
is
clear
and
unambiguous,
so
clear
and
unambiguous,
apparently,
there
was
no
need
to
even
dwell
upon
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
1513(d),
no
need
to
even
take
a
glance
at
the
legislative
history
of
1513(d),
which
the
court
did
not
do,
so
clear
apparently
no
need
to
even
consider
an
opinion
of
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
eight
months
earlier
which
reached
exactly
the
opposite
conclusion
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute
on
virtually
the
same
facts.
north
dakota
had
an
airline
flight
property
tax
and
north
dakota
exempted
other
property.
and
the
north
dakota
court,
in
holding
that
the
statute
had
been
violated,
noted
that
it
was
its
duty
to
avoid
what
it
called
ludicrous
and
absurd
results.
now,
the
language
that
south
dakota
finds
to
be
so
clear
and
unambiguous
includes
this
key
phrase:
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
that
phrase
appears
in
the
definition
of
commercial
and
industrial
property,
and
that's
the
comparison
class
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
there
is
discrimination.
1513(d)
says
roughly
this:
you
shall
not
assess
air
carrier
property
at
a
higher
percentage
of
true
value
than
other
commercial
and
industrial
property;
second,
you
shall
not
tax
air
carrier
property
at
a
higher
rate
than
other
commercial
and
industrial
property.
and
commercial
and
industrial
property
is
defined
in
the
statute,
with
few
exceptions,
as
property
devoted
to
a
commercial
and
industrial
use
and
subject
to
a
property
tax
levy,
and
those
are
the
key
words.
and
south
dakota
says
that
means,
that
definition
means,
property
that's
being
put
to
a
commercial
and
industrial
use
and
is
being
taxes,
as
distinguished
from
capable
of
being
taxed.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
exactly,
justice
black.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
continental
was
a
party
in
the
lower
court.
they
decided
not
to
pursue
the
appeal.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
they
would
benefit
from
a
favorable
decision
of
the
court.
but
they
have
not...
they're
not
a
party
to
this
appeal.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
i
can't
be
sure
of
that,
justice
white,
either.
there's
been
a
reduction
in
flying
in
south
dakota.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
got
anything
to
do
with
the
tax
here
or
not.
in
any
case,
the
short
of
it
is
that
south
dakota
says,
since
there
is
no
property
being
taxed
in
the
state,
personal
property,
there
is
no
property
in
the
comparison
class,
hence
there's
no
violation
of
1513(d).
now,
the
first
problem
we
have
with
that
analysis
is
the
idea
that
the
words
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
are
all
that
clear
and
unambiguous.
i
mean,
the
words
"subject
to",
as
we
all
know,
are
often
used
to
refer
to
things
that
could
happen
as
well
as
things
that
have
happened,
like
in
the
phrase
"subject
to
further
order
of
the
court.
"
or
"subject
to
change
without
notice",
or
"subject
to
high
winds
or
flooding.
"
or
anything.
those
are
all
things
that
haven't
happened
yet.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
i
think
you
could
make
something
out
of
that
distinction,
justice
scalia,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
looking
at
this
with
a
semantic
microscope,
really,
when
congress
was
painting
a
picture
here
with
very
broad
strokes.
as
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
you'll
see
that
the
kind
of
precision
that
you're
suggesting
went
into
the
fixing
of
those
words
is
lacking
everywhere
else
in
this
statute.
and
i
suggest
that
it
just
wasn't
that
deliberate
a
choice
as
between
"a"
or
not
using
the
letter
"a".
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
i
think
it's
what
could
constitutionally,
and
i
think
it
was
also
probably
meant
to
exclude
property
that
was
traditionally
nontaxable
by
the
states.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
there
are
commercial
properties
being
put
to
a
commercial
or
industrial
use
by
the
federal
government
that
are
not
taxable.
there
are
certain
commercial
properties
of
charitable
organizations
that
are
not
taxable
in
some
states.
so
those
are
examples.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
could
i
answer
it
this
way:
the
words
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
entered
the
statute
quite
long
before
the
words
"commercial
and
industrial
property".
in
other
words,
this
statute
had
like
a
15
year
history
before
it
finally
got
enacted,
and
in
the
course
of
that
15
years
it
was
built
sort
of
brick
by
brick.
and
the
first
brick,
one
of
the
early
bricks
that
went
in
there,
were
the
words
and
when
they
went
in
there,
of
course,
the
words
"commercial
or
industrial
property"
were
not
there.
the
reference
class
was
all
other
property.
so
it
was
all
other
property
subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
and
in
those
circumstances,
the
words
obviously
served
a
certain
function,
because
otherwise
all
property,
federal
lands
in
the
west
for
example,
would
theoretically
have
been
covered
within
the
comparison
class.
so
when
it
went
into
the
statute--
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
--yes.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
that's
right,
and
an
argument
can
be
made
that
the
words
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
were
in
effect
unnecessary
from
the
beginning
because
it
was
clear--
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
--from
the
very
beginning
you
could
regard
them
that
way,
yes.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
adds
new
language
such
as
"commercial
and
industrial
property"?
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
when
congress
added
the
words
"commercial
and
industrial
property"
it
was
trying
to
narrow
the
comparison
class
to
some
extent,
to
get
at
what
they
were
really
concerned
about,
which
was
business
property
and
not
all
other
property.
but
i
fail
to
see
how
choosing
a
narrower
class
makes
the
term
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
mean
something
different.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
yes.
the
original
phrase
was
"subject
to
the
same
property
tax
levy.
"
that
was...
the
original
bill
was
focused
only
on
assessments.
that
was
the
concern
the
railroads
had.
and
it
was
said
assessments
subject
to
the
same
property
tax
levy.
later
on
the
railroads
began
to
realize
that
that
wasn't
the
kind
of
protection
they
wanted,
because
classifications
of
tax...
tax
classifications
could
be
developed
which
made
it
possible
to
discriminate
in
terms
of
assessments.
you
could
have
a
higher
tax
rate
and
have
therefore
a
different
assessment.
so
they
went
into
the
business
of
adopting
a
provision
which
would
have
protected
against
tax
rates
being
discriminatory,
as
well
as
assessments.
that's
when
1(c)
was
added
to
the
statute
in
1967.
have
i
answered
the
question?
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
i
understand
that,
and
i'm
saying
it
still
means
something
even
today.
even
though
the
words
"commercial
and
industrial
property"
exclude
a
lot
of
otherwise
non-taxable
property,
there
is
still
property
devoted
to
a
commercial
or
industrial
use
which
is
not
taxable.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
federal
facilities:
the
tva,
amtrak,
property
like
that.
so
it's
not
surplusage
in
any
case.
what
the
state
is
saying
is
that
the
adoption
of
the
words
"subject
to"...
the
adoption
of
the
words
"commercial
and
industrial
property"
suddenly
accomplish
a
radical
transformation
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
that
they
suddenly
created
a
different
meaning
for
the
words
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
than
it
had
before.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
it
was
not
a
rush
job
in
the
sense
that
it
took
place
over
a
period
of
15
years.
but
all
i'm
saying
is,
if
you
attribute
the
adoption
of
the
words
"commercial
and
industrial"...
to
those
words,
"commercial
and
industrial
property",
a
major
change
in
the
meaning
of
the
words
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
there
ought
to
be
some
basis
for
attributing
that.
i
mean,
why
would
congress,
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
narrowing
the
class
to
business
property,
have
created
an
opportunity
for
a
huge
exception
for
business
property?
and
that's
what
the
state
is
basically
arguing,
that
when
you
changed
it
from
all
of
the
property
to
commercial
and
industrial
property
you
changed
the
meaning
of
the
statute
considerably,
because
the
words
thereafter
had
no
meaning.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
averaging
that
rate
into
the
total
rate
for
all
property
in
the
state,
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
as
i
say,
there
is
no
specific
legislative
history
on
the
subject,
except
the
railroads
at
one
time
were
asked
what
they
thought
the
term
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
meant.
and
one
of
the
statements
that
was
made
i
think
was
a
significant
one.
one
of
the
railroad
representatives
said
that
the
issue
here
is
really
state
policy
versus
federal
policy,
and
the
states
can
have
their
tax
policies,
they
can
give
tax
breaks
to
people
they
want
to
give
tax
breaks
to.
but
we
have
a
federal
policy
as
well.
and
all
that
congress
is
saying
is
that
that
federal
policy
has
to
be...
is
such
that
if
you
give
a
tax
break
to
any
commercial
or
industrial
user,
that
has
to
be
averaged
into
the
way
you
treat
interstate
carriers.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
perfectly
reasonable
conclusion.
what
we
do
not
have
here
in
all
this
legislative
history
is
anything
that
says
what
congress
meant
by
the
words
what
we
do
have
is
what
congress
meant
to
establish
by
the
statute,
and
i
think
that's
the
key
point.
i
mean,
you
compare
the
words
which
are
totally
unexplained,
with
the
prohibition
on
discrimination,
which
is
very
clearly
explained.
let
me
just
read
you
a
few
lines
out
of
one
of
the
early
senate
reports,
and
this
deals
with
the
words
that
permit...
that
prohibit
tax
rate
discrimination.
that's
subparagraph
(c).
it
say:
"the
purpose
of
subparagraph
(c)
is
to
forbid
state
or
local
classifications,
whether
based
on
constitutional
provisions,
statutory
enactment,
or
administrative
order
or
practice,
which
are
designed
or
have
the
effect
of
discriminating
against
carrier
transportation
property.
"
now,
that
we
know
is
what
congress
meant
by
(c).
we
know
that
what
we
have
in
south
dakota
is
a
scheme
which
has
the
effect
clearly
of
discriminating
against
carrier
property.
we
don't
know
precisely
what
it
is
in
some
legislative
history
limbo.
we
simply
have
very
little
on
it,
so
we
have
to
speculate.
so
it's
a
question,
it
seems
to
me,
of
balancing
the
thing
we
know
with
the
thing
we
don't
know.
and
if
we
say
these
words
override
what
we
clearly
know
congress
meant
in
the
substantive
provisions,
we're
in
effect
letting
the
tail
wag
the
dog
here.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
they
would
have
to
develop
an
average
rate
for
personal
property
in
the
state
that
is
subject,
that
is
eligible
for
taxation.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
the
state
has
the
option
of
not
taxing
airlines.
all
the
statute
says,
you
can
tax
whoever
you
want,
you
can
give
whatever
tax
breaks
you
want,
but
you
have
to
treat
airlines
the
same
as
the
average
way
you
treat
other
business
property.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
the
lower
court,
the
south
dakota
supreme
court,
rejected
the
argument
that
it
was
an
in
lieu
tax,
on
the
theory
that
it
wasn't
in
lieu
of
anything,
which
i
think
was
a
correct
holding.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
whether
it
is
or
is
not
in
lieu?
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you're
asking
does
the
court
have
that
issue
before
it,
i
would
say
no.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
yes,
it
certainly
could,
it
certainly
could.
and
that
was
clearly
a
condition
to
getting
the
statute
passed,
was
getting
that
in
there.
but
that's
not
what
south
dakota
has
chosen
to
do.
obviously,
if
they
had
taxed
other
personal
property
and
made
the
airline
tax
in
lieu
of
that
tax,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
let
me
start
by
saying
it
was
put
in
for
railroads
at
the
very
last
minute
in
the
legislative
history,
because
the
railroads
called
to
the
attention
of
the
committee
a
gross
receipts
tax
that
new
york
was
imposing
on
the
new
york
dock
railway.
that's
what
the
legislative
history
tells
us.
now,
when
we
come
to
the
motor
carrier
statute,
which
was
the
next
one
after
the
rail
statute,
it
was
perfectly
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
prohibit
highway
user
taxes,
and
the
reports
say
that.
so
there's
a
very
good
reason
why,
in
light
of
that
feeling
on
congress'
part,
it
would
not
have
put
in
the
statute
that
catch-all
clause.
when
it
came
to
the
airline,
the
object
was...
i
mean,
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
adopt
the
motor
carrier
provisions,
which
it
did,
which
excluded
that
provision.
but
in
addition,
the
airlines
already
had
protection
against
gross
receipts
taxes
in
1315(a).
so
the
reason
the
railroads
needed
that
blanket
provision
was
not
applicable
to
the
airlines,
and
in
any
case
the
airlines
themselves
did
not
seek
that
provision
when
the
proposed
the
bill
to
congress.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
yes.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
if
you're
at
the
same
time
excusing
the
airlines
from
paying
another
tax.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
but
we're
not
being
excused
from
paying
any
other
tax,
because
no
other
tax
would
apply
to
us.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
i
think
if
the
statute
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
a
tax
used
for
aeronautical
purposes,
that
would
be
the
correct
answer.
but
it
says
an
in
lieu
tax
for
aeronautical
purposes,
not
just
any
tax.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
in
lieu.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
neither
the
state
nor
the
appellants
think
it's
an
in
lieu
tax.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
i
understand.
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
terrible
mistake
to
regard
this
as
an
in
lieu
tax,
unless
you
can
find
some
other
tax
that
it's
in
lieu
of.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
yes,
of
course
the
court
can
read
that
phrase
any
way
it
wants.
it
seems
to
me
very
hard
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
an
in
lieu
tax
is
an
in
lieu
tax
if
it's
not
in
lieu
of
anything.
and
it
isn't
in
lieu
of
anything.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
yes,
yes.
but
that's
not
our
situation
here.
yes,
definitely,
that
would
be
an
in
lieu
tax.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
well,
as
i
understood
the
reasoning
of
the
south
dakota
supreme
court,
it
was
that
it
wasn't
a
tax
that
replaced
any
other
tax,
and
therefore--
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
--sure,
justice
scalia.
but
i
have
trouble
understanding
what
this
tax
is
in
lieu
of,
in
this
case,
on
these
facts.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
there
are
really
two
issues
that
south
dakota
has
raised
here
in
terms
of
legislative
history,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
here,
even
if
the
south
dakota
court
did
not
do
so.
one
is...
and
both
of
them
involve
changes
that
took
place
along
this
15
year
history
of
the
railroad
bill
that
supposedly
were
of
some
significance
to
this,
to
the
determination
of
this
court.
and
one
is
when
they
put
in
the
provision
on
"subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
"
at
the
tail
end
of
the
definition
of
commercial
and
industrial
property,
instead
of
where
it
had
previously
been
and
that
is
in
the
assessment
section.
and
they
say
that
that
was
a
determination
that
suddenly
made
the
words
mean
something
far
more,
mean
that
it
created
a
loophole
that
wasn't
here
in
the
bill
in
the
past,
even
though
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
that.
and
i
guess
i
have
said
this
before.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you're
going
to
conclude
that
the
shift
of
the
words
from
the
assessment
section
to
the
definition
section
were
intended
to
have
major
significance,
which
is
what
the
state
seems
to
be
saying,
you
have
to
have
some
legislative
history
to
support
that.
and
there's
no
explanation
for
that
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history.
there's
plenty
of
explanation
as
to
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish,
but
nothing
about
this
switch,
no
explanation
from
senator
hartke,
who
was
the
principal
proponent
of
it,
nothing
in
the
reports.
and
i
think
that
what
we're
getting
at
here
is
the
state
is
saying
there
was
a
major
change
that
took
place,
but
nobody
knew
it.
and
that's
not
the
stuff
that
legislative
history
is
made
of.
i
think
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my--
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
--the
average
rate,
average
tax
rate
for
interstate
airlines
would
have
to
be...
excuse
me.
the
tax
rate
for
interstate
airlines
would
have
to
be
the
average
rate
applied
to
other
business
property
in
the
state.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
yes.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
lower
courts
have
dealt
with
this
at
some
length.
you
could
use
a
weighted
mean,
you
could
use
a
median.
there
are
a
lot
of
different
ways,
but
you
have
to
figure
out...
the
legislative
history
says
this...
what
the
average
tax
was
on
the
other
business
properties
in
the
state.
and
that
is
taxed
no
higher
than...
can
be
no
higher
than
the
tax
for
aircraft
of
these
airlines.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
thank
you.
i'll
reserve
the
rest.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
yes,
just
a
couple
of
brief
points.
first
of
all,
on
the
in
lieu
issue
we
pay,
the
airlines
that
is,
every
tax
that
the
state
may
lawfully
impose
on
us,
and
that
includes
principally
real
property
taxes,
which
is
their
principal
source
of
revenue.
the
only
other
point
i
would
make--
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
--that
is
true,
although
i
think
that's
not
really--
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
--if
it
were--
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
--i
can't
tell
you
a
specific
piece
of
real
estate.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
no,
i
do
not
know.
but
if
they
had
it,
they
would
pay
it.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
all
i'm
saying
is
that
it's
not...
this
tax
is
not
in
lieu
of
real
estate
taxes
or
any
other
taxes
that
the
state
imposes.
the
other
final
point
is,
remember
that
this
is
not
just
south
dakota
that's
involved
or
just
these
airlines.
we're
talking
about
a
proposition
that
would
have
broad
applicability
to
a
lot
of
states
which
don't
have
personal
property
taxes,
which
could
imposes
taxes
on
airlines
just
as
south
dakota
did,
where
we
have
a
lot
more
aircraft
and
a
lot
more
train
rolling
stock
and
buses,
and
where
a
lot
more
money
than
$200,000
could
be
involved.
and
if
those
states
were
to
do
that
on
invitation
of
the
court
in
the
decision
in
this
case,
we
would
basically
simply
create
exactly
the
kind
of
property
tax
discrimination
that
this
whole
project,
these
three
pieces
of
legislation,
were
designed
to
eliminate
at
the
time
and
in
conjunction
with,
as
we
know,
the
carriers
were
being
deregulated
by
the
congress.
mr.
raymond
j.
rasenberger
at
this
time,
none
that
i
can
mention.
all
i'm
saying
is
that,
if
the
court
holds
for
south
dakota,
other
states
would
be
free
to
impose
such
taxes.
thank
you.
