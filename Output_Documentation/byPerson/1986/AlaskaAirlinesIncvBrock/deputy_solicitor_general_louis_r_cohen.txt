mr.
louis
r.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
propose
to
argue
two
propositions.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
chose
the
proper
rule
for
determining
whether
an
otherwise
valid
part
of
a
statute
must
be
invalidated
along
with
an
unconstitutional
part.
and
second,
in
this
case,
the
evidence
against
throwing
the
employee
protection
baby
out
with
the
legislative
veto
bathwater
was,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
overwhelming.
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
following
the
rule
articulated
in
chadha.
the
invalid
portions
of
a
statute
are
to
be
severed,
and
the
balance
sustained,
unless
it
is
evident
that
the
legislature
would
not
have
enacted
those
provisions
which
are
within
its
power
independently
of
that
which
is
not.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
but
what
the
court
said
in
chadha--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--that's
correct.
and
after
stating
the
test,
which
the
court
had
stated
in
previous
cases,
the
court
said
in
chadha,
we
need
not
make
that...
i
think
the
words
were...
elusive
inquiry
here,
because
congress
has
told
us
the
answer.
it
is
correct
that
in
this
case
the
inquiry
must
be
made,
as
the
court
of
appeals
made
it.
but
the
test,
as
stated
in
chadha,
is...
and
i
believe
the
parties
are
in
agreement
on
this...
whether
it
is
evident
that
congress
would
not
have
enacted
the
provision
that
is
before
us,
the
duty-to-hire
provisions--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes,
i'm
suggesting
that
it
is
perhaps
easier
to
satisfy
the
test
when
there
is
a
severability
clause
in
which
congress
has
told
you
what
its
intent
is.
but
the
question,
in
each
case,
is
whether,
based
on
an
assessment
of
congressional
intent,
you
conclude
that
congress...
that
it
is
evident
that
congress
would
not
have
enacted
the--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--as
congress'
direct
statement
of
its
intention,
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
that
when
the
court
stated
the
test
as
being
whether
it
is
evident
that
congress
would
not
have
enacted
the
otherwise
valid
portion
in
the
absence
of
the
unconstitutional
part,
it
was
certainly
suggesting
a
presumption
or
suggesting
that
the
burden
of
proof
must
be
on
those
who
would
strike
down
more
of
the
legislation
than
congress...
than
the
constitution
requires.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
first,
it
is
dormant,
and
will
remain
dormant
unless
and
until
congress--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--appropriates
funds.
its
status
in
this
case,
i
think,
is
this:
it
was
not
challenged
by
petitioners
in
their
complaint.
the
district
court,
nevertheless,
said
that
the...
that
all
of
the
remaining
provisions
of
section
43
would
have
to
be
invalidated
along
with
the
legislative
veto.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
saying
the
financial
assistance
provisions
are
not
before
us;
but
saying
later
in
the
opinion
that
all
of
the
remaining
provisions
are
severable.
so
i
think
the
financial
assistance
provisions
are
not...
are
not
before
you.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
will.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
reach
the
first
of
those
questions
in
this
case.
but
i
think
that
it
would
theoretically
be
possible
for
the
court,
were
both
questions
before
it,
to
conclude
that
the
financial
assistance
provision
must
be
invalidated
along
with
the
legislative
veto.
and
that
would
not
invalidate
the
duty-to-hire
provisions.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that
the
presence
of
a
severability
clause
does
not
change
the
test;
it
changes
the
task
of
the
court,
which
is
applying
the
test.
it
means
that
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
and
the
legislative
history,
to
determine
congressional
intent
without
the
guide
that
the
severability
clause
may
provide.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
what
the
court
said
in
chadha
was,
that
the
severability
clause
told
the
court
that
it
was
congress'
intention
that
one
of
the...
that
the
substantive
provision
in
that
case
should
survive
not
withstanding
the
demise
of
the
veto.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that
you
can
come
to
a
conclusion
in
this
case
based
on
the
evidence
derived
from
the
structure
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute.
i
think
that
even
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
severability
clause,
there
can
be
an
open
question
as
to
whether
the
effect
of
the
invalidation
of
one
provision
is
to
change
the
rest
of
the
statute
into
something
other
than
congress
intended
and
enacted.
and...
but
i
think
that
if
the
effect
of
invalidation
of
one
provision
is
to
leave
an
operative
balance
of
the
statute,
then
the
existence
of
a
severability
clause,
as
the
court
thought
it
did
in
chadha,
pretty
much
ends
the
inquiry.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
should
be...
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
there
ought
to
be
a
presumption
in
favor
of
severability,
and
in
favor
of
saving
what
the
constitution
does
not
itself
invalidate.
one
of
those
reasons
is
that
courts
have
no
power
to
invalidate
statutes
except
the
command
of
the
constitution
or
the
state
or
inferred
intent
of
congress.
and
the
best
evidence
of
what
congress
wanted
is
what
it
wrote.
and
the
court
should
not,
i
suggest,
infer
a
contrary
intent
unless
the
evidence
supporting
the
inference
is
clear.
but
second,
if
a
court
doesn't
demand
a
convincing
showing
before
it
invalidates
a
statute...
before
it
invalidates
more
of
a
statute
than
the
constitution
requires...
there's
no
stopping
place.
and
some
very
large
horses
will
be
lost
over
some
very
small
nails.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
parties
agree
that
the
legislative
veto
must
go.
the
question
is:
how
much
more
must
go
with
it?
petitioners
would
cut
all
of
section
43,
but
that
would
leave
airline
deregulation
with
no
employee
protection.
and
as
we
and
others,
particularly
the
airlines
pilots
association
and
the
afl-cio,
demonstrate
in
the
briefs,
there
is
a
good
deal
of
evidence
that
congress
might
not
have
enacted
airline
deregulation
without
employee
protection.
i
think
to
get
a
stopping
place,
one
must
apply
the
test
as
it
was
formulated
in
chadha,
and
ask,
is
it
evident
that
congress
would
not
have
enacted
a
part
of
the
statute
that
is
not
in
and
of
itself
unconstitutional
if
it
had
known--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
don't
think
that
works.
and
i
don't
think
it
works
for
two
reasons.
one,
obviously,
congress
doesn't
always
know
when
it
is
adopting
something
that
will
create
constitutional
trouble
later
on.
but
second,
the
question
of
severability
does
not
and
cannot
disappear
merely
because
there
is
a
severability
clause,
as
the...
because
it
doesn't
tell
you
the
answer
to
the
question
which
is
in
fact
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
where
do
you
cut?
if
you...
the
debate
between
the...
between
the
plurality
and
justice
brennan
on
the
question
of
severability
in
regan
v.
time,
inc.,
was
a
debate
about
whether
the
effect
of
a...
the
excision
of
some
words
in
a
statute
changed
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
i
don't
think
a
severability
clause
would
have
resolved
that
issue.
i
think
the
court
was
right
when
it
said
in
the
jackson
case
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
severability
clause
will
rarely
determine
the
issue,
and
the
question
is,
is
the
court
going
to
seek
to
preserve
the
balance
of
what
congress
enacted
whenever
it
can.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that
you
have
in
this
case,
also
from
congress,
the
adoption
of
the
remaining
portion
of
the
statute
as
an
indication
of
what
it
wanted
done.
and,
again,
the
problem
of
where
do
you
cut
is
the
hard...
is
the
hard
problem
here.
the...
if...
if
the
doctrine
were
that
in
the
absence
of
a
severability
clause,
everything
that
might
be
thought
to
have
been
part
of
a
package
in
any
congressman's
mind,
with
the
unconstitutional
provision
might
go,
i
don't
know
how
you
stop
short
of
the
work
of
an
entire
session
of
congress.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
only
number
i
know
is
justice
white's
200.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
and
this
court,
of
course,
has
affirmed
the
severance
of
several.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
first
of
all,
even
if
that
were
said
in
this
case,
the
duty-to-hire
program
would
not,
i
suggest,
fall
with
the
legislative
veto.
and
let
me
turn
to
that.
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
was
correct
when
it
said
that
there's
ample
evidence
that
the
employee
protection
program
was
deemed
by
congress
to
be
an
important
aspect
of
the
act,
and
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
the
legislative
veto
was
deemed
by--
the
briefs
list
the
evidence
that
employee
protection
was
an
important
part
of
this
complex
legislative
bargain.
petitioners
only
response
is
that
there
were
also
expectations
that
deregulation
would
lead
to
increased
employment
in
the
industry.
but
of
course,
this
was
an
insurance
program,
important
even
if
the
patient
stayed
healthy.
and
beside
that,
as
the
senate
report
makes
clear,
the
senate
feared
that
some
airlines
might
contract
while
the
rest
of
the
industry
was
growing,
and
the
duty
of
growing
airlines
to
give
a
hiring
preference
to
displaced
employees
of
the
shrinking
ones--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
they
are
contending
that
section
43(f)
and
section
43(d)--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--are
both
invalid.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
there
are
two
different
parts
of
43(d).
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
section
43(d)(1)
imposes
a
duty
to
hire
as
a
direct
obligation.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that
is
not
subject
to
any
veto
or
any
other
contingency.
it
confers--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
it
is.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
i'm
very
happy
if
he's
conceded
that
section
43(d)(1)--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--that
section
43(d)(1)
is
valid,
because
it
imposes
a
duty
to
hire--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--a
well
defined
on,
directly
on
a
well
defined
class
of
carriers,
and
it
confers
a
right
of
first
hire
directly
on--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes,
and
that,
by
the
way,
to
answer
something
that
mr.
coleman
said,
is
also
the
secretary's
view
of
the
regulations,
say,
at
page
47a,
nothing
in
these
regulations
shall
preclude
the
exercise
of
statutory
rights
and
duties
between
october
24,
1978,
and
the
effective
date
of
these
regulations.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
it
does
not.
now,
the
regulations
we
are
talking
about
are,
in
part,
provided
for
in
section
43(d)(2),
a
separate
subsection,
which
gives
the
secretary
of
labor
some
assignments,
but
it
gives
him,
i
suggest,
no
assignments
that
there's
any
reason
to
think
congress
would
not
have
given
him
if
it
had
known
it
could
not
have
a
legislative
veto.
it
just
doesn't
delegate
any
responsibility
that
there's
any
reason
to
think
congress
wouldn't
have
been
willing
to
delegate
unconditionally.
it
directs
the
secretary
to
maintain
and
publish
lists
of
available
jobs;
it
authorizes
the
secretary
to
require
carriers
to
provide
the
necessary
information;
it
directs
him
to
make
every
effort
to
assist
an
eligible
protected
employee
in
finding
other
employment;
and
then
finally,
subsection
(f)(1)
says
that
the
secretary
may
issue
such
rules
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
administration
of
the
section.
and
if
we
are
to
apply
the
test
of
whether
it
is
evident,
or
indeed,
whether
there
is
any
significant
likelihood
at
all
that
congress
would
have
been
unwilling
to
give
the
secretary
of
labor
those
assignments
if
it
had
known
it
could
not
have
a
legislative
veto,
the
answer
is
that
there
is
not.
mr.
coleman
implies
that
the
statute
leaves
gaps
to
be
filled
in
by
regulation.
his
principal
one
is
that
there
is
some
question,
he
says,
whether
an
employee
was
meant
to
be
protected
if
his
unemployment
is
not
demonstrably
due
to
deregulation.
he
made
that
argument
to
judge
gesell
who
pointed
out
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
support
it,
and
rejected
it
as
without
merit.
now,
while
there's
nothing
in
the
secretary's
assignment
in
connection
with
the
duty
to
hire
that
there's
any
reason
to
think
that
any
member
of
congress
might
have
wanted
to
veto,
there
is
an
evident
reason
for
the
legislative
veto,
and
that
is,
that
the
committees
did
want
to
have
a
second
look
at
the
levels
of
assistance
that
were
to
be
set
by
the
secretary
under
the
now
inoperative
financial
assistance
program.
that
was
the
hot
issue,
and
indeed,
the
only
mention
of
the
legislative
veto
in
the
committee
reports,
and
one
of
the
two
mentions
of
it
in
the
entire
legislative
history,
appears
in
the
senate
report
where
the
senate
committee
says,
the
amount
of
such
payments
would
be
determined
by
regulations
promulgated
by
the
department
of
labor.
these
regulations
will
be
subject
to
congressional
review.
petitioners
response
to
this
is
that
the
duty
to
hire
and
the
financial
assistance
were
supposed
to
operate
in
tandem.
but
that
is
true
only
in
the
sense
that
the
duty
to
hire
was
the
primary
remedy
expected
to
reduce
the
financial
burden
on
the
government
from
the
fallback...
from
the
government's
fallback
remedy
of
financial
assistance.
the
statute
itself
provided
for
financial
assistance
only
until
the
recipient
obtains
other
employment.
there
isn't
any
reason
to
assume
that
someone
who
wanted
to
veto
the
financial
assistance
would
have
wanted
to
veto
requiring
an
airline
that
was
otherwise
hiring
to
give
first
preference,
on
whatever
conditions
the
airline
prescribes,
to
displaced
employees.
and
the...
there's
nothing
whatever
to
support
petitioners'
suggestion
that
the
continuation
of
their
duty
to
hire,
notwithstanding
the
dormancy
of
the
financial
assistance
program,
is
either
unfair
to
them
or
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress.
their
argument
that
the
congress
would
not
have
enacted
the
duty
to
hire
if
it
could
not
have
a
legislative
veto
is
based
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
circumstantial
evidence.
they
point
out
that
this
is
the
only
section
in
the
statute
that
contains
a
veto.
but
the
absence
of
a
veto
provision
in
other
sections
tells
us
nothing
whatever
about
whether
this
veto
is
an
important
provision
or
an
unimportant
provision.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
presence
of
the
veto
is
explained
by
the
financial
assistance
program,
which
is
not
before
the
court;
and
the
absence
of
the
veto
in
other
sections
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
this
is
primarily
a
deregulatory
statute.
mr.
coleman
says
that
there
are
25
other
regulatory
provisions.
he
has
only
listed
four
of
them
in
his
brief.
and
i
think
that
we
adequately
demonstrate
that
each
of
the
four
was
a
minor
and
technical
one.
petitioners
argue
that
two
other
legislative
oversight
features...
the
six-month
provision
and
the
report
and
wait
provision...
show
the
special
importance
of
this
legislative
veto.
but
apart
from
the
fact
that
these
provisions,
too,
relate
primarily
to
financial
assistance...
indeed,
the
six-month
requirement
for
the
promulgation
of
regulations
is
directly
linked
to
that
in
the
statute...
both
provisions
make
it
less
likely;
both
the
six-month
provision
and
the
duty-to-hire
provision
make
it
less
likely
that
congress,
if
it
had
been
told,
you
can't
have
a
legislative
veto,
would
have
scrapped
the
duty-to-hire
program.
the
six-month
provision
shows
that
congress
was
sufficiently
concerned
about
labor
protection
to
want
to
be
sure
regulations
were
in
place
promptly.
the
report
and
wait
provision
gave
congress
a
valid
method
of
oversight;
that
is,
the
court
observed
in
chadha,
made
the
veto
even
less
important.
petitioners
suggestion
that
the
legislative
veto
was
part
of
a
deliberate
trade
at
conference
is,
i
have
to
say,
a
figment
of
their
imagination.
the
statute
itself,
the
conference
report,
and
the
postconference
debate,
contain
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
bargaining
that
related
in
anyway
to
the
veto.
certainly
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
house,
which
had
a
bill
providing
more
protection
and
much
more
discretion,
which
did
not
contain
a
legislative
veto,
demanded
a
legislative
veto
as
the
price
of
accepting
the
senate
bill.
in
sum,
if,
as
i
think
you
should,
you
assume
that
even
in
the
absence
of
a
severability
clause,
which
the
court
told
congress
would
rarely
make
a
difference,
if
you
assume
that
even
in
the
absence
of
a
severability
clause,
the
court's
job
is
to
see
whether
there
is
evidence
in
the
structure
and
history
of
the
statute
that
congress
would
not
have
enacted
a
particular
provision
if
it
had
known
it
could
not
have
another
provision,
the
answer
as
to
both
the
statutory
duty
under
section
43(d)(1),
and
the
authorization
to
write
regulations
that
were
incidental
that
duty,
would
clearly,
i
think
in
this
case,
have
been
enacted
in
any
event.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
let
me
qualify
it
to
say
that
the
secretary's
own
assignments,
the
assignments
to
prepare
and
maintain
and
publish
lists
of
available
jobs,
and
to
obtain
information
from
the
airlines
for
that
purpose,
are
assignments
that
presumably
called
for
him
to
issue
regulations.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no,
no,
no.
publishing,
the
mechanics
for
that
process,
publishing
regulations;
which
is
what
these
regulations
do,
which
say
that
airlines
shall
file
information
about
available
jobs
with
the
secretary
and
so
forth.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
it's
correct
that
congress
not
only...
that
congress
did
not...
not
only
didn't
expect
to
veto
any
regulations
with
respect
to
the
duty
to
hire,
but
that
there's
no
sign
that
they
had
any
affirmative
expectation
that
whole
provision,
which
is
the
only
thing
before
us,
would
involve
the
issuance
of
regulations
at
all.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
and
when
congress
does
to
say,
regulations
shall
be
sent
up
to
us
within
six
months,
it
says,
the
regulations
under
subsection
(b)
relating
to
the
financial
assistance
program,
and
such
other
regulations
as
the
secretary
may
wish...
may
wish
to
promulgate.
and
that's
what
the
statute
says.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
ask
it
to
affirm.
