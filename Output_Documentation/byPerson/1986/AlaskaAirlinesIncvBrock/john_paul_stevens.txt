justice
stevens
mr.
coleman,
could
i
interrupt
you
right
there,
because
it's
something
i'm
not
clear
about
in
the
statute.
during
this
four
or
five
year
period
between
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
the
finally...
1983,
when
they
did
promulgate
regulations,
did
the
statute
have
any
effect
at
all?
justice
stevens
the
first
hire
provision?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
i
mean,
they
spell
out...
they
give
lists
of
employees
and
things
like
that,
too.
justice
stevens
but
your
position
is
that
until
the
regulations
were
promulgated,
the
statute
was
basically
a
nullity?
justice
stevens
well,
at
least
to
completely
effectuate
it.
at
least
it
would
be
arguable.
justice
stevens
it
might
be
arguable
that
even
without
the
regulations,
there
were
some
employee
rights
that
were--
justice
stevens
--right.
justice
stevens
of
course,
this
principal
could
have
restricted
it
any
time
after
the
chadha
decision
by
simply
repealing
this
section
of
the
act,
couldn't
it?
justice
stevens
it
requires
two
houses
of
congress
instead
of
one.
justice
stevens
and
the
president
has
to--
justice
stevens
--no,
but
my
question
is
directed
to
the
period
after
the
legislative
veto
was
clearly
no
longer
out
there.
did
anybody
in
congress
say,
hey,
we
better
repeal
this
provision,
because
otherwise
somebody
might
go
ahead
and
issue
some
regulations?
justice
stevens
mr.
coleman,
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
respond
to
judge
starr's
argument
that
one
thing
is
fairly
clear,
and
that
is,
that
after
the
congress
compromised...
he
didn't
use
these
words...
between
the
union
position
and
the
employer
position,
they
at
least
decided
this
much,
that
there
should
be
some
form
of
employee
protection.
and
if
you
sustain
your
position
here,
there'll
be
no
employee
protection,
which
would
really
give
the
airlines
even
greater
relief
than
if
they'd
won
the
legislative
battle
about
how
much
the
benefit
should
be?
justice
stevens
no,
but--
justice
stevens
--i
mean...
i
mean...
i'm
just
directing
my
remarks
to
employee
protection.
justice
stevens
they
didn't
want
employee
protection.
or
at
least
this
much.
justice
stevens
which
they're
not
getting.
justice
stevens
now
they
don't
even
get
their
second
choice.
justice
stevens
well,
may
i
just
pursue
that
a
moment?
in
this
case,
the
question
isn't
whether
there
shall
be
any
severability.
it's...
the
question
is
how
much
you
sever.
because
even
judge
gesell
severed
43
from
the
rest
of
the
statute.
and
you're
saying
we
should
only
sever
the
veto
from
the
rest
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
mr.
cohen,
can
i
interrupt,
because
i
just
realized,
i'm
not
sure
i
know
what
the
issue
is
here.
are
they
contending
that
section
43(f)
is
invalid,
or
that
section
43
in
its
entirety
is
invalid?
justice
stevens
but
the...
but
using
justice
scalia's
test,
only
section
43(f)
would
fall,
and
section
43(d)
would
survive,
because
there's
no
legislative
veto
with
regard
to
43(d);
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
right,
but
one
of
them
deals
with
the
preferential
hiring;
one
of
the
two.
justice
stevens
that's
right.
justice
stevens
and
my
question
is
whether
that
section...
i
should
have
said,
not
just
(d),
but
(d)(1).
is
that
being
challenged
in
this
litigation?
i
think
it
is.
justice
stevens
--and
it's
your
view
that
duty
existed
during
the
period
before
the
promulgation
of
the
regulations?
