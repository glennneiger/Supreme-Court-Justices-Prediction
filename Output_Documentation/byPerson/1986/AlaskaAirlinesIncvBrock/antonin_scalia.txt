justice
scalia
mr.
coleman,
do
you
disagree
with
the
argument
that
the...
that
what
the
legislative
veto
was
mainly
directed
at,
what
consisted
of
the
main
degree
of
discretion
here,
was
not
the
issuance
of
regulations
dealing
with
the
right
of
first
hire,
but
rather,
the
regulations
dealing
with
the
obtaining
of
federal
assistance,
that
that's
what
the
congress
was
worried
that
the
secretary
was
going
to
do
something--
justice
scalia
what
if
we
are
in
equipoise?
we
can't
really
figure
out
either
way?
justice
scalia
just
imagine.
justice
scalia
if
we
really...
you
know,
we're
very
honest,
and
we
say,
i
really
can't
tell
what
congress
would
have
done.
and
suppose
we
say
that.
justice
scalia
then
who
wins?
does
it
stay
or
go?
justice
scalia
so
you're
saying,
unless
we
can
find
that
they
would
have
adopted
it
in
this
form
without
this
provision,
we
should
strike
down
the
whole
thing?
justice
scalia
and
the
burden
is
on
those
who
want
to
retain
the
provision
without
the
legislative
veto
to
show
that
that
is--
justice
scalia
0
xxx.
justice
scalia
that
makes
a
big
difference,
don't
you
think?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
there
congress
told
us
what
to
do;
that
basically,
it
wants
us
to
salvage
as
much
as
we
can.
justice
scalia
mr.
cohen,
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
the
difference
between
statutes
that
contain
a
severability
clause
and
those
that
don't.
i
mean,
congress
thinks
these
things
mean
something,
because
they
have
a
regular
practice
of
putting
them
in
sometimes,
and
not
putting
them
in
other
times,
and
they
think
there's
a
difference.
now,
what
do
you
assert
that
difference
is?
i
thought
you
said
at
first
that
there's
no
difference
at
all,
but
then
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
i
thought
you
said
there
was
a
difference.
justice
scalia
what
guide
is
the...
i
don't...
you
say
it,
but
i
don't
understand
it.
what
guide
does
the
severability
clause
provide?
justice
scalia
well,
then,
that's
a
different
test,
i
would
say.
and
i
would
say
that
when
there's
a
severability
clause,
you're
asserting
that
so
long
as
the
things
can
mechanically
work
without
the
legislative
veto,
congress
is
telling
us,
apply
it.
and
whether
it
can
mechanically
work
is
quite
a
different
test
from
whether...
whether
congress
would
have
enacted
the
one
without
the
other.
i
mean,
i'm
very
reluctant
to
come
to
a
decision
in
this
case
that's
going
to,
you
know,
make
no
difference
between
this
and
cases
in
which
there
is
a
severability
clause.
justice
scalia
mr.
cohen,
how
does
congress
know
how
we're
going
to
come
out
on
this
thing?
i
mean,
the
people
in
one
house
don't
know
what
the
people
in
the
other
house
are
saying,
or
will
say,
if
the
other
house
is
going
to
act
later.
it
seems
to
me
there's
going
to
be
a
constant
game
of
legislative
chicken
with
some
lawmakers
putting
in
provisions
that
are
arguably
unconstitutional;
some
legislators
may
vote
for
them,
thinking
they'll
be
stricken
and
the
rest
will
stand;
and
others
may
vote
for
them
thinking
they'll
be
stricken
and
the
rest
will
fall.
it
creates
chaos.
wouldn't
be
better
off
to
adopt
a
clear...
a
clear
line
that
the
members
of
congress,
when
they
vote
on
provisions
of
dubious
constitutionality,
will
know
what
the
result
will
be
if
it
falls
down?
and
what
you're
proposing
is
not
a
clear
line
at
all.
now,
you
could
adopt
a
line
that
says
if
there's
a
severability
clause,
the
matter
will
stand,
so
long
as
you
can
mechanically
implement
it.
when
there's
no
severability
clause,
the
entire
provision
to
which
the
legislative
veto,
for
example,
is
attached,
will
fall.
justice
scalia
well,
at
least
with
the
legislative
veto
provision,
which...
and
there
are
a
lot
of
them
out
there.
how
many
are
remaining
in
existing
statutes
that
have
to
be
determined
sooner
or
later?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
some
of
those
may
have...
i
mean
the
legislation
may
have
lapsed
since
then,
i
don't
know.
justice
scalia
but
at
least
as
to
the
legislative
veto
provision,
you
could
say
that
the
entire
regulation
provision
to
which
the
veto
is
attached
falls
if
there
is
no
severability
clause,
and
it
doesn't
fall,
so
long
as
it
can
mechanically
work,
if
there
is
one.
that's
quick
and
easy
and
clear.
and
it
eliminates
a
lot
of
litigation.
justice
scalia
"d"?
justice
scalia
i
thought...
i
thought
mr.
coleman
said
he'd
be
willing
to
take
his
chances
with
the
statute;
that
it's
only
the
regulations
that
give
him
trouble.
i'm
sure
he'd
like
to
see
(d)
go
as
well,
but
i
think
he...
he's
willing
to--
justice
scalia
--well,
that's
what
i
thought
he
said.
i
guess
he'll
have
time
to
respond
later.
justice
scalia
and
it's
your
view,
i
take
it--
justice
scalia
am
i
correct
that
the
only
regulations
that
are
required
to
be
issued
under
the
act
are
the
guidelines
under
(b)(1),
the
financial
assistance
guidelines?
are
they
the
only
ones
that
are
required
to
be
issued?
justice
scalia
so
everything
else,
in
implementing
that
chapter,
the
secretary
could
have
done
by
adjudication
instead
of...
instead
of
by
rule,
right?
justice
scalia
really?
you
think
that's
a
regulation,
publishing...
periodically
publishing
a
comprehensive
list
of
jobs
available?
justice
scalia
that's
not
a
regulation.
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure.
i'm
not
sure
you
would
need
regulations
for
the
secretary
to
do
anything
else
under
this
act,
except
the
financial
assistance
portion.
so
in
requiring
the
approval
of
congress,
really
the
only
thing
for
which
the
approval
of
congress
was
unquestionably
required
was
the
establishment
of
the
guidelines
for
the
monthly
assistance
payments.
and
the
rest
could
conceivably
have
been
done
without
regulation
anyway,
and
could
have
been
beyond
the
control
of
congress.
justice
scalia
there's
no
requirement
there
that
he
issue
any
regulations.
whereas
there
is
for
the
monthly
assistance
computation.
he's
mandated,
guidelines
are
mandated.
justice
scalia
this
is
on
page
46a
of--
justice
scalia
--right,
right.
justice
scalia
oh,
authority,
section
43(f)
of
the
airline
deregulation
act.
justice
scalia
oh,
but
that's
not
the
point.
i
don't
doubt
that
he's
acting
under
43(f).
justice
scalia
what
i
doubt
is
that
he
had
to
be...
he
had
to
act
under...
he
had
to
issue
any
rules
and
regulations
under
43(f).
justice
scalia
you
see,
by
reason
of...
by
reason
of
43(d)...
i'm
sorry,
(b)(1),
he
had
to
proceed
by
regulation
with
respect
to
financial
assistance.
but
i
see
nothing
in
there
that
required
him
to
proceed
by
regulation
with
regard
to
employee
hiring.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
he
might
do
it.
he's
authorized
to
issue
regulations.
but--
justice
scalia
--where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
scalia
if
he
wants
to.
he
has
to
do
it
within
six
months.
justice
scalia
but
there's
nothing
that
says
he
has
to
issue
any
regulations.
if
he
issues
them,
they
have
to
be
issued
within
six
months.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
right.
and
that
one--
justice
scalia
--i
have
no
doubt
he's
proceeding
under
(f).
but
my
point
is,
he
didn't
have
to
proceed
under
(f).
he
could
have
done
it
without
the
issuance
of
regulations.
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
you
understand
why
i
think
it
important,
mr.
coleman.
i
think
it
important
because
there
is
no
way,
as
this
statute
is
set
up,
for
the
congress...
for
the
secretary
to
do
an
end
run
around
the
legislative
veto
as
far
as
financial
assistance
is
concerned.
the
only
way
he
can
get
financial
assistance
out
there
is
by
issuing
regulations.
he
is
mandated
to
do
it
by
regulation.
he
could
have
done
an
end
run
around
the
legislative
veto
on
the
remaining
portion,
because--
