chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
alaska
airlines
against
brock.
mr.
coleman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--section
43(f).
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
coleman,
i
presume
all
of
this
goes
to
formulating
the
answer
which
you
think
we
should
come
to
to
the
proper
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now
what
is
the
question
we
should
ask?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--put
another
way,
perhaps,
the
question
is,
would
the
principal
have
given
the
agent
that
authority
knowing
that
he
could
not
restrict
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
task
is
the
same
regardless
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
severability
clause,
mr.
cohen?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
would
factor
in
the
existence
of
a
severability
clause,
then,
as
simply...
as
weighing
evidence
of
what
congress
wanted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
have
some
doubt
as
to
the
correctness...
perhaps
the
court
did
say
this
in
jackson...
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
severability
clause
should
never...
should
seldom
make
any
difference.
that's
the
best
expression
we
have
from
congress
addressing
to
the
situation
where
some
part
of
the
statute
is
held
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
(d)(1)
doesn't
appear
to
depend
for
its
efficacy
on
the
issuance
of
regulations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
mr.
coleman,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
coleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-920,
alaska
airlines
versus
brock
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
