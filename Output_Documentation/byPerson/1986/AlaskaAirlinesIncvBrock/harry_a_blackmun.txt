mr.
cohen,
while
you're
interrupted,
what
is
the
present
status
of
the
monthly
assistance
clause?
justice
blackmun
appropriates--
justice
blackmun
--do
you
think
it
ever
will
be
made
undormant,
if
there
is
such
a
word?
justice
blackmun
do
you
also...
well,
i'll
ask
you:
could
we
come
out
with
one
answer
about
severability
with
respect
to
the
monthly
assistance
provision
and
another
answer
with
respect
to
the
hire
provision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
in
this
case
the
petitioners
are
14
of
the
major
air
carriers
of
the
country.
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
and
it
concerned
the
so-called
employee
protection
program
in
section
43
of
the
airline
deregulation
act
of
1978.
and
this
imposed
on
the
air
carriers
a
duty
to
hire
qualified
airline
personnel
who
are
dislocated
as
a
result
of
the
deregulation.
section
43
authorize
the
secretary
of
labor
to
issue
regulations.
but
that
section
also
contained
a
legislating-veto
provision
and
it
is
that
provision
which
is
the
focus
of
this
lawsuit.
the
airlines
filed
suit
and
the
district
court
gathered
summary
judgment
in
their
favor.
holding
that
the
legislative-veto
provision
was
unconstitutional
under
the
chadha
case
decided
here
not
too
long
ago,
and
striking
down
the
entire
employee
protection
program
on
the
ground
that
the
veto
provision
was
not
severable
from
the
remainder
of
the
act.
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
that
judgment.
the
case
came
here,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
section
43's
legislative-veto
provision
is
indeed
severable
from
the
remainder
of
the
employee
protection
program.
the
court
is
unanimous
in
this
ruling.
