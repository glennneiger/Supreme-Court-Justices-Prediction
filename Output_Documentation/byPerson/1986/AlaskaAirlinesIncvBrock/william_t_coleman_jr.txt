mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here
is
would
congress
have
enacted
the
remaining
provisions
of
the
section
43
employment...
employee
protection
program
in
the
broad
language
it
did
if
it
had
known
that
the
one-house
legislative
veto
provision,
exclusively
applicable
thereto,
set
forth
in
the
same
section,
was
unconstitutional.
first,
the
relevant
facts.
having
made
new
entry
and
additional
air
service
possible
by
replacing
economic
regulation
with
competition,
congress
recognized
that
the
airline
deregulation
act
of
1978
would
expand
airline
employment.
the
cab
and
now
the
department
of
transportation
already
have
authority
to
impose
labor
protective
provisions
as
a
condition
of
government
approved
private
transactions.
nevertheless,
late
in
the
legislative
process,
congress
added
section
43
to
provide
a
single
integrated
employee
protection
program.
the
house
and
senate
had
each
passed
bills
providing
for
government
assistance,
money
paid
by
the
government
to
airline
employees
who
lost
their
job
because
of
deregulation.
the
house
bill,
in
the
traditional
form
of
employee
protection,
conditioned
the
exercise
of
authority
under
the
deregulation
act,
for
example
merger
authority,
on
certification
by
the
secretary
of
labor
of
protective
arrangements
similar
to
those
set
forth
in
section
5(2)(f)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
benefits
paid
by
the
airline
would
be
reimbursed
by
the
government.
the
senate
bill
involved
a
completely
new
concept
of
employee
protection.
if
an
airline
went
bankrupt
or
had
a
15
percent
workforce
reduction
caused
by
deregulation,
its
employees
would
be
entitled
to
government
financial
assistance,
and,
solely
to
offset
the
government's
cost,
the
right
of
first
hire
by
other
pre-1978
certificated
carriers;
the
same
section
authorized
the
secretary
of
labor
to
issue
regulations
to
effectuate
the
existence
program
and
the
duty-to-hire
program.
all
regulations
were
subject
to
one-house
veto.
in
reaching
a
compromise,
the
conference
committee
deferred
several
important
basic
policy
decisions
relating
to
benefit
levels
and
eligibility
for
assistance
in
hiring
preference.
instead,
it
directed
the
secretary
of
labor
to
adopt,
within
six
months
of
october
24,
1978...
and
that
date
appears
in
the
statute,
your
honor...
all
regulations
necessary
to
provide
financial
benefits
and
hiring
preferences.
that
delegation
was
subject
to
a
unique
set
of
procedural
and
time
restraints
that
ensured
congress'
active
involvement
in
the
program's
development.
congress
reserved
ultimate
regulatory
authority
through
the
right
of
either
house
to
exercise
the
legislative
veto.
section
43,
nor
anywhere
else
in
the
deregulation
act,
is
there
a
severability
clause.
in
1979,
the
secretary
of
labor
proposed
regulations
to
implement
both
the
financial
assistance
and
the
hiring
preference
aspects
of
the
program.
final
regulations
were
submitted
to
congress
on
january
19th,
1981,
but
withdrawn
14
days
later,
which
is
long
before
the
60
day
legislative
period
that
they
were
to
lay
before
the
congress.
for
several
years
thereafter,
there
were
no
regulations;
there
was
no
employment
protection
program.
then
on
june
23rd,
1983,
this
court
held
legislative
veto
provisions
unconstitutional.
only
thereafter
were
the
regulations
promulgated.
and
they
attempt
to
effectuate
only
the
hiring
preference.
fourteen
covered
airlines
challenged
the
regulations--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--we
don't
think
it
had
any
effect
at
all,
your
honor.
but
to
answer
you
completely,
there
is
one
case
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
where
a
plaintiff
has
claimed
that
the
statute
does
have
effect
with
respect
to
the
right
of
first
hire.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it's
not
spelled
out
in
the
statute,
and
this
raises
a
question
that
you
get
from
time
to
time,
where
there's
a
statutory
provision
which
doesn't
say
you
have
a
private
cause
of
action;
do
you?
and
that's
on
litigation.
but
other
than
that,
i
know
of
no
instances.
it's
the
position
of
the
airlines
that
the
statute
has
no
effect.
certainly
it's
the
position
of
the
airlines
that
the
regulations
completely
change
whatever
effect
the
statute--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--yes,
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
and
also,
in
that
connection,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
in
the
petition,
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert,
which
is...
which
is
the
record
in
this
case,
on
page
49,
with
respect
to
the
regulations,
it's
stated
that
the
regulations
were
issued
to
effectuate
the
section
which
deals
with
the
right
of
first
hire.
in
other
words,
that
certainly
the
administrator
thought
that
he
needed
these
regulations
to
effectuate
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it
says,
effectuate
it.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
but
not
clearly
these
regulations.
it's
these
regulations
that
we're
trying
to
upset.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
and
also,
since
you
also
have
before
you
the
record,
i'd
like
you
to
look
at
page
46a,
where
you
see...
where
the
administrator
says,
his
authority
that
he's
acting
under
is
section
43(f),
and
that's
the
section
that
has
the
one-house
veto
in
it.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
we
disagree
100
percent,
your
honor.
when
you
read
every
page
that
the
government
cites
in
this
book
here,
you
will
find
that
what
is
being
described
is
the
employee
protection
program.
there
is
one
program.
and
that
program
consisted
of
both
parts.
another
evidence
of
that
fact,
and
the
government
calls
your
attention
to
the
zorinsky
amendment,
where
he
said
that
he
wanted
to
exclude
the
financial
payment
part,
but
he
wanted
to
have
the
right
to
hire
part.
they
don't
tell
you
that
when
you
look
at
the
amendment
you
will
find
that
with
respect
to
the
right
to
hire
part,
he
still
had
the
veto
provision.
and
so
we
say,
it
goes
to
both.
because
when
you
read
the
statute,
when
you
reread
the
statute,
you
will
find
that
it's
impossible
to
work
out
the
program
that's
in
the
regulations
without
having
the
regulation.
when
this
was
before
judge
gesell,
he
determined
that
the
legislative
veto
provision
of
section
483
was
inextricably
bound
with
the
remainder
of
that
section,
and
that
congress
would
not
have
enacted
the
remainder
of
the
section
43
in
its
absence.
he
therefore
declared
the
entire
section
43
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
language
and
structure
of
section
43,
as
it
emerged
from
the
conference,
house
conference,
senate
conference,
showed
that
the
legislative
veto
was
essential
in
the
unique
legislative-executive
partnership
established
in
section
43
to
develop
a
single
integrated
employment
program
for
protection.
respondents
ignore
the
veto's
importance
in
the
structure
of
section
43,
relying
mainly
on
the
lack
of
a
big
floor
debate,
espousing
the
virtues
of
legislative
vetoes.
but
this
court
has
said,
on
many
occasions,
the
statute
itself
is
the
most
important
aspect
of
congressional
intent.
and
as
dean
griswold
said
in
that
wonderful
casebook
he
had
on
tax,
don't
think
great
thoughts
about
the
internal
revenue
code;
read
the
statute.
and
so
therefore,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
statute.
it
appears
beginning
on
page
38a
in
the
appendix.
the
heart
is
section
43(f),
which
provides
elaborate
and
detailed
constraints
on
whatever
regulatory
authority
was
granted
the
secretary,
who
incidentally,
was
the
head
of
an
agency
not
otherwise
involved
in
air
deregulation
or
subject
to
the
aviation
committee
of
congress.
look
at
section
43.
it
contains
four
interrelated
provisions.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
43(f),
yes,
sir,
which
is
on
page
42a.
the
regulations
to
be
issued
are
those,
quote,
necessary
for
the
administration
of,
and,
quote,
to
carry
out
section
43.
all
regulations
must
be
promulgated
within
six
months
after
october
24,
1978.
all
proposed
regulations
must
be
submitted
to
the
aviation
committee
for
30
legislative
days.
all
final
regulations
must
be
submitted
to
congress
for
60
legislative
days,
during
which
period
either
house
may
disapprove
them.
these
four
interrelated
constraints
on
the
secretary's
authority
was
exclusively
applied
to
section
43
to
ensure
active
congressional
participation
in
adopting
and
epp
program
by
many
of
the
same
committee
members
who
drafted
the
act.
it
is
quite
significant
in
establishing
the
tight
time
restraints,
congress
reserved
to
itself
a
substantial
amount
of
time
for
this
legislative-executive
collaboration.
and
that,
i
call
your
attention
to
section
43(f)(4).
it
is
also
significant
that
of
the
four
interrelated
constraints,
two
were
added
by
the
conference
committee.
the
legislative
veto
has
always
been
a
part
of
the
controversial
senate
epp
proposal.
but
in
reaching
the
compromise,
congress
decided
to
defer
certain
basic
policy
questions
dealing
with
the
scope
of
the
program.
it
therefore
made
the
veto
substantially
more
effective
by
strengthening
the
collaborative
process;
by
retaining
ultimate
authority
over
the
secretary's
regulations,
both
houses
of
congress,
who
each
had...
incidentally,
had
different
viewpoints
with
respect
to
labor
protection--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
question
you
should
ask
is,
whether,
when
you
read
this
statute,
would
congress
have
enacted
the
statute
in
the
form
it
did
if
it
did
not
have
the
legislative
veto?
if
you
conclude
that
they
would
not
have,
then
you
at
that
point,
you
determine
that
the
section
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
judge...
mr.
justice,
that-would
be
very
unfamiliar
to
almost
anybody
on
this
court
to
be
in
equipoise.
you
all
do
come
down
one
way
or
the
other.
but
leaving
that
aside--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--pardon?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
you
then
should
say,
the
one
thing--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--the
one
thing
that's
clear,
you
should
say
at
that
point,
how
can
i
let
them
issue
regulations
which
clearly
were
subject
to
be
rewritten
by
the
congress,
and
let
those
regulations
stand.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
you
strike
down
the
whole
thing.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
that
one
ought
not
to
be
able
to
come
in
and
say,
i
have
authority
to
do
something,
but
the
person
who
gave
me
authority
also
put
a
restriction
on
it.
the
restriction
is
bad,
but
i
still
have
the
authority.
and
that's,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
issue
that
you
have
before
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it
could
have
restricted
it...
well,
but
that's
a
whole
new
legislative
process.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh,
not
only
that.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it
also
requires
the
action
by
the
president.
and
even
if
he
vetoes
it,
then
there
has
to
be
a
two-house
overrule.
and
this
is
completely
different
here,
because
it's
clear
here
that
what
happened...
and
this
is
very
dramatic;
i've
asked
you
to
examine
the
evidence
as
to
what
happened
as
long
as
the
legislative
veto
was
out
there.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no,
nobody...
nobody...
nobody
said
that,
because,
frankly,
we
had
a
legislative
situation
which
has
existed,
that
on
the
one
hand,
the
unions
wanted
much
more
money.
on
the
other
hand,
the
airlines
felt
that
the
program
should
be
limited
only
to
the
airline
that
was
the
cause
of
the
loss,
or
at
most,
only
in
those
instances
where
the
act
caused
the
unemployment.
when
this
was
before
president
carter,
and
he
finally
submitted
a
program
which
had
both
parts,
it
never
moved
through
the
congress,
either
way,
because
the
unions
thought
there
should
be
more
money,
and
the
airlines
thought
the
coverage
of
the
regulation
was
too
broad.
and
so
nothing
happened
until
after
the
election,
and
one
day
before
the
change
of
administration,
final
regulations
were
published.
fourteen
days
later
they
were
withdrawn.
thereafter,
the
new
administration
published
proposed
regulations.
the
legislative
veto
is
still
in
effect;
i
mean,
at
least
you
haven't
declared
it
unconstitutional
yet.
the
new
administration
would
not
send
those
regulations
up
to
the
hill
for
the
30-day
legislative
period.
it
was
only
after
the
court
declared
the
veto
unconstitutional
that
the
legislation...
i
mean,
the
regulations
were
sent
up.
and
then,
because
one
who
wanted
to
change
the
situation
either
way,
no
longer
had
the
effective
power
over
the
executive
to
bring
about
those
changes.
now,
that's
the
reason
why
you...
the
majority
of
your
in
chadha
said
that
you
can't
have
that
separation
of
power.
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
and
agree
whether
you
were
right
or
wrong,
because
that's
already
been
decided.
but
once
you
decide
that,
i
just
ask
you
that
if
there's
been
a
legislative
process,
and
on
the
tough
issues
both
sides
stood
down
and
said,
let's
wait
for
the
regulation
and
we
will
have
this
additional
activity
before
they
become
effective,
and
then
that
is
destroyed,
can
you
in
good
conscience
say
that
that's
what
congress
intended.
now,
this
legislative
veto
is
different
from
those
in
a
lot
of
other
statutes.
this
is
not
a
case
where
you
have
a
broad,
big
statute,
and
you
have
a
lot
of
different
provisions
for
issuing
regulations,
and
then
someplace
in
the
statute,
there's
a
veto
provision.
in
fact,
in
the
deregulation
act,
there
are
25
regulatory
delegations,
but
only
one
is
subject
to
the
one-house
veto,
and
that's
the
one
in
section
43,
and
it
applies
exclusively
to
the
employee
protection
program.
in
fact
the
conference
committee
rejected
the
only
other
legislative
veto
provision
from
the
senate
passed
bill
at
the
same
time
it
was
strengthening
this
particular
provision.
now,
as
i
read
the
respondents'
brief,
they
concede
that
the
veto
was
an
important
congressional
constraint
on
the
financial
assistance
part
of
the
epp.
but
they
then
search
the
legislative
history
in
vain
to
support
their
argument
that
the
legislative
veto
was
only
essential
to
a
check
on
the
financial
guidelines.
and
that's
where
they
point
to
senator...
or
zorinsky,
and
as
i
indicated,
when
he
made
the
amendment,
he
kept
the
one-house
veto.
but
i'd
like,
more
to
the
point,
to
take
you
to
the
language
in
the
structure
of
section
43.
there's
nothing
in
there
where
congress
limits
the
veto
to
regulations
implementing
section
43(a)(1),
which
is
the
financial
assistance
subsection.
section
43
expressly
applies
the
elaborate
legislative
oversight
provisions
to
all
regulations
issued
pursuant
to
section
43.
in
fact,
as
i
said,
the
secretary
here
claims
that
any
authority
he
has
comes
from
section
43(f).
when
you
look
at
the
structure
of
section
43,
you
realize
that
the
congress
was
talking
about
one
program.
if
you
have
any
doubt
about
that,
look
at
section
22
of
the
senate
bill,
from
which
section
43
emerged.
in
that
bill,
both
the
hiring
preference
and
the
financial
payments
were
triggered
by
the
same
15
percent
reduction
in
workforce,
or
bankruptcy,
and
in
both
cases,
there
was
a
legislative
veto.
then
look
at
section
43
itself.
on
page
38a,
the
title,
employee
protection
program.
and
look
at
the
definition
section.
and
then
look
at
the
section
which
is
on
page
44a,
which
is
(j),
the
termination.
and
it
says
that
"the
provisions
of
this
section"...
and
that's
both
the
financial
payments
and
the
duty
to
hire...
"terminate
on
th
last
day
the
secretary
if
required
to
make.
"
the
payment.
so
it
seems
to
us,
your
honor,
that
once
you
say
that
the
legislative
veto
is
bad,
that
certainly
thereafter
you
cannot
put
the
parties
in
the
place
where
they
would
be.
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
have
a
committee
involved
in
the
rewriting
of
this
provision.
and
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
number
one,
i
think
when
you
reread
the
battle
that
went
on,
you
realize
that
most
of
the
certificated
airline
did
not
want
the
deregulation.
so
you
start
with
a
false
premise.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
this
is
not
something
that
the
airlines
wanted.
but
taking
yours--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
what
i
say
to
that
is,
your
honor,
when
you
reread
that
legislative
history,
you
will
find
what
the
unions
really,
really
wanted
was
the
financial
payments
by
the
government.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that
they
don't
get.
now
i
really
think--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--now
i
really
think...
i
really
think
it's
unfair
for
the
government
to
be
here
saying
that
even
though
section
43(a)(1)
says,
there
should
be
financial
payments,
and
if
you
look
at
the...
if
you
look
at
the
provision
that
they
say
is
the
determination
was,
that
this
changed
the
public
should
pay
for,
they're
not
going
to
pay
for
a
penny.
but
yet,
they
have
passed
regulations
which
are
far
beyond
the
statute.
put
if
you
just
say
the
regulations
are
bad,
i'll
take
my
chances
on
the
statute.
because
they
cannot
get
out
of
the
statute
what
they
got
out
of
the
regulation.
now
it
just
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances,
if...
until...
and
as
long
as
that
happened,
the
process
worked.
as
long
as
the
government
was
willing
to
come
up
and
take
care
of
its
financial
contribution,
the
congressional
process
was
working.
it
was
only
when
they
split
the
program...
and
i
think
we've
demonstrated
that
you
can't
split
the
program;
it's
supposed
to
be
one
program.
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
justice
scalia,
your
question,
that's
the
reason
why
i
called
your
attention
to
46a
of
the
record.
the
secretary
says
that
his
authority
that
he's
exercising
to
issue
these
regulations
is
that
authority
contained
in
section
43(f).
he
cites
no
other
authority.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
of
the
appendix,
which
is
the
record
in
the
case.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
he
says--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--that's
what
he
says
he's
acting
under.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
entire
section
43
is
null
and
void.
i
would
just
urge
you
to
read
the
legislative
history--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--well,
i'd
like
to
disagree
with
you,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--if
you
go
on
and
read
that...
if
you
go
on
and
read
the
rest
of
the
section,
that
he's
also
required
to
issue
the
other
rules
and
regulations
which
the
secretary
deems
necessary
to
carry
out
this
section.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i'm
reading
the
same
section
you're
reading
from,
from
(f)(2).
it
says,
he's
supposed
to
issue
the
guidelines
with
respect
to
the
money,
but
also,
any
other
regulations
which
he
deems
necessary
to
carry
out
this
section.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
but
the
one
issue
he
had
to
issue
was
the
financial
regulation;
he's
never
done
it.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
a
statute
where
the
one
thing
it's
clear
that
he
was
supposed
to
do,
he
hasn't
done,
i
don't
think
you
then
say,
well,
i'm
going
to
save
another
part
of
the
statute
where
it's
clear
that
the
regulations
that
he's
trying
to
issue
is
to
enforce
the
second
part
of
that
statute.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
mean,
if
he
moved
on
another...
if
he
cited
some
other
authority,
i
may
not
be
in
court.
but
it
seems
to
me,
when
the
secretary
says,
i'm
proceeding
under
this
section,
he's
got
to
defend
his
authority
under
that
section.
i'm
not
saying
he
may
not
have
another
section.
and
what
i'd
like
to
say
just
in
closing--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--he
could
not.
he
could
not,
sir.
because
if
he'd
done
what
he
was
supposed
to
have
done
under
the
statute,
he
would
have
had
both
up
there,
because
he
was
supposed
to
have
one
program.
in
conclusion,
may
i
say,
as
i
understand
your
cases,
you
really
have
two
sets
of
cases.
one
set
says,
if
congress
does
four
different
things
exercising
four
different
powers,
and
you
determine
that
one
of
the
four
is
invalid,
does
that
mean
that
the
other
three
are
also
invalid?
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
el
paso
railroad
case;
that's
carter
coal
company;
and
all
those
cases.
a
separate
and
distinct
set
of
cases
is
where
congress
exercises
one
power
and
puts
a
condition
on
that
power,
can
you
say
that
the
condition
is
invalid,
but
you
leave
the
executive
with
the
power?
and
it
seems
to--
