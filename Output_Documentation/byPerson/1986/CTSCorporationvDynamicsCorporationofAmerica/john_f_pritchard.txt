mr.
john
f.
pritchard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
--the
shares
have
been
purchased.
the
statute
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional,
your
honor,
and
for
that
reason
the
vote
that
the
statute
provides
for
has
not
been
held.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
no.
no,
your
honor.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
direct
myself
to
the
practical
impact
of
the
indiana
statute,
because
it
was
judge
posner's
findings
on
this
score
that
led
him
to
strike
the
statute
on
commerce
clause
grounds.
he
concluded,
we
believe
improperly,
that
the
statute
failed
the
tests
set
out
in
pike
v.
bruce
church
because
the
benefits
that
it
imposed
on
interstate
commerce
were
excessive
in
relation
to
its
putative
local
benefits.
it
is
worth
noting
at
the
outset
that
the
record
contains
no
evidence
whatsoever
concerning
either
the
burdens
or
the
benefits
of
the
statute,
nor
has
there
been
any
experience
under
this
statute
or
under
any
similar
statute
which
might
shed
any
light
on
the
subject.
accordingly,
the
findings
of
the
court
below
were
based
solely
on
speculation
and
this
court
is
not
required
to
pay
them
any
special
deference.
now,
addressing
the
burden
side--
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
we
believe
that
takeovers
would
be
able
to
occur
on
essentially
the
same
time
schedule
and
using
essentially
the
same
procedures
that
they
occur
on
now.
the
only
difference--
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
where
they
occur...
tender
offers
do
not
always
succeed,
your
honor.
they
would
not
always
succeed
under
the
indiana
statute.
but
we
don't
believe,
for
reasons
i
will
get
to,
that
the
indiana
statute
imposes
any
significant
burden
on
the
conduct
of
these
corporate
wars.
we
are
really
talking
about
hostile
tender
offers,
not
friendly
offers,
in
the
context
of
the
indiana
statute.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
judge
posner
concluded
in
his
opinion
that
the
statute,
in
his
words,
set
up
a
gauntlet
that
few
tender
offers
could
run.
this
is
strong
and
colorful
language,
but
on
what
basis
did
he
reach
these
conclusions?
he
gives
us
only
two
reasons.
first,
since
in
his
view
no
rational
bidder
seeking
control
of
an
indiana
corporation
would
purchase
the
shares
without
knowing
the
outcome
of
the
shareholder
vote,
and
since
the
shareholder
vote
could
not
transpire
except
after
50
days,
that
the
statute
as
a
practical
matter
imposes
a
50-day
delay
on
the
consummation
of
tender
offers
and
he
considered
that
this
would
be
burdensome.
second,
he
stated
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
requires
a
shareholder
vote,
the
success
of
the
offer
is,
as
he
put
it,
subject
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
existing
shareholders
of
the
company.
on
the
first
point,
we
submit
that
judge
posner
was
simply
wrong
because
he
failed
to
consider
the
practical
alternatives
that
are
open
to
a
bidder
in
a
tender
offer
to
which
the
statute
applies.
we
demonstrate
in
our
brief
that
nothing
in
the
statute
delays
the
commencement
of
a
tender
offer.
there
is
no
pre-notification
requirement
like
the
one
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
mite.
nothing
in
the
statute
prevents
shareholders
from
tendering
their
shares
immediately
to
the
bidder,
to
the
bidder's
escrow
agent,
as
soon
as
the
offer
has
been
made.
and
importantly,
nothing
in
the
statute
prevents
the
bidder
from
accepting
the
shares
that
have
been
tendered
for
payment,
thus
consummating
the
purchase
immediately
after
the
minimum
28-day
waiting
period
that
is
provided
for
in
the
<sec's>
[=
sec's]
rules.
we
may
concede
judge
posner's
point
that
many
bidders
seeking
control
would
want
the
voting
rights
issue
resolved
before
they
paid
for
the
stock.
but
this
desire
is
easily
accommodated
as
the
bidder
could
request
the
shareholder
election
on
the
same
day
he
presents
the
offer,
and
structure
the
offer
so
that
the
acceptance
of
the
tendered
shares
for
payment
was
conditioned
upon
the
later
outcome
of
a
favorable
vote
on
the
voting
rights
issue.
this
would
have
the
effect
of
locking
up
the
stock
so
far
as
the
bidder
was
concerned,
and
it
would
also
cut
off
shareholders'
right
to
withdraw
their
shares
after
the
acceptance.
your
honors,
this
procedure
is
not
new.
it
is
followed
every
day
in
many
tender
offers
which
are
subject
to
conditions
such
as
the
receipt
of
required
regulatory
approvals
such
as
those
imposed
by
the
federal
communications
commission,
by
the
federal
reserve
board,
by
the
insurance
commissioners
of
various
states
who
are
required
to
approve
a
transfer
of
control
before
it
takes
place.
it
is
also
followed
when
offers
are
conditioned
on
the
dismantling
of
certain
defenses
that
the
targets
of
these
tender
offers
have
erected,
such
as
poison
pills,
so
that
to
condition
the
acceptance
for
payment
on
the
receipt
of
voting
rights
is
no
different
from
the
practice
that
prevails
in
other
contexts
routinely
in
the
tender
offer
area.
in
fact,
so
common
is
this
practice
that
the
sec
has
provided
explicit
guidance
on
the
subject
in
its
interpretive
releases
which
we
quote
in
our
brief.
and
it
is
instructive,
we
believe,
that
despite
the
opportunity
to
do
so
in
its
brief,
the
sec
did
not
take
the
position
that
the
50-day
period
for
the
election
would
result
in
any
actual
delay.
even
if
the
statute
did
delay
the
consummation
of
the
purchase
for
50
days,
that
period
is
limited.
it
is
not
an
unlimited
period
as
the
court
dealt
with
in
mite.
and
i
know
it
is
only
22
days
longer
than
the
minimum
period
of
28
days
that
is
prescribed
by
the
sec's
own
rules.
so,
much
more
is
required,
we
submit,
than
unsupported
speculation
to
find
that
this
so
burdens
tender
offers
as
to
render
the
indiana
statute
unconstitutional.
this
is
especially
true,
your
honors,
when
there
has
been
no
showing
that
there
are
defenses
which
the
target
could
put
into
place
in
50
days
that
the
target
couldn't
also
put
into
place
in
28
days.
furthermore,
we
believe
that
no
showing
could
be
made
that
hostile
tender
offers
can
normally
be
concluded
in
28
days,
given
the
litigation
that
swirls
around
these
corporate
wars.
turning
to
the
second
point,
judge
posner
felt
that
the
shareholder
vote,
the
fact
that
a
shareholder
vote
had
to
take
place,
was
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
however,
it
seems
self-evident
that
if
the
majority
of
the
shareholders
wished
to
tender
their
shares
in
response
to
a
tender
offer,
they
will
also
vote
to
confer
voting
rights
because
only
by
conferring
voting
rights
will
they
be
able
ultimately
to
receive
payment
from
the
bidder.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
no,
your
honor.
the
votes...
well,
the
bidder's
votes
are
excluded
but
the
votes
of
the
shareholders...
excuse
me.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
he
only
needs
a
majority
of
the
disinterested
shares.
that
would
be
the
majority
of
the
shares
other
than
his
own,
so
that
he
wouldn't
need
a
super-majority,
so
to
speak,
of
the
shares
of
the
entire
corporation.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
well,
he
would
need
30
percent.
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
but
that's
30
percent
of
the
disinterested
shareholders.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
right,
your
honor,
it
is
50
percent
of
the
disinterested.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
but
his
40
percent
does
not
vote,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
so
that
you
are
having--
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
--by
virtue
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
it
is
a
majority
of
the
very
shareholders
who
are
interested
in
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
in
tendering
their
shares.
that
is
my
point,
your
honor,
and
if
a
majority
of
the
persons
to
whom
the
offer
is
directed
wish
to
accept
it
because
the
price
is
so
attractive,
or
for
other
reasons,
they
are
entitled
to
do
so.
mr.
john
f.
pritchard
your
honor,
that
is
another
question.
the
question,
at
what
level
a
dominant
shareholder
actually
acquires
working
control
of
a
corporation
is
another
matter.
we
submit
that
at
33
and
a
third
percent
in
publicly
traded
corporations,
the
dominant
shareholder
has
working
control.
he
has
working
control
at
40.
he
has
absolute
control
at
50.
