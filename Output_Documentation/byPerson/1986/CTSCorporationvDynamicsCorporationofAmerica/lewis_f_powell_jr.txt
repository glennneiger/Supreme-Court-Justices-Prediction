justice
jr.
may
i
follow
up
on
the
question...
i
am
over
here.
justice
jr.
justice
o'connor
asked
about
one
of
the
purposes
served
perhaps
by
this
statute,
and
other
similar
statutes,
is
to
retain
major
corporate
headquarters
in
a
state.
it
certainly
is
a
benefit
to
have
the
headquarters
of
a
major
corporation
located
in
a
state
from
a
standpoint
of
employees,
civic
and
charitable
contributions,
and
the
like.
justice
jr.
you
have
perhaps
read
about
the
uproar
down
in
north
carolina.
justice
jr.
where
there
was
some
talk
that
r.j.
reynolds
will
no
longer
be
in
that
state.
so,
why
do
you
concede,
or
do
you,
that
this
is
not
even
an
objective
in
any
way
whatever,
this
particular
statute?
justice
jr.
that
was
a
little
too
quick,
there.
there
is
some
balancing
involved
in
commerce
clause
cases,
and
arguably
a
structural
change
alters
the
balance
more
than
some
other
kinds
of
changes.
a
state
may
have
more
of
an
interest
in
preventing
a
structural
change
than
in
preventing
an
ownership
change.
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
at
the
outset...
i
don't
know
why
whenever
i
speak
somebody
looks
over
there...
what
is
the
status
of
this
controversy
now?
has
the
takeover
been
accomplished?
justice
jr.
so,
no
question
of
mootness?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
case
presents
two
questions
as
to
the
validity
of
indiana's
control
share
acquisition
act.
first,
whether
the
federal
williams
act
preempts
the
indiana
law;
second,
whether
the
state
law
violates
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
the
indiana
act
applies
to
tender
offers.
it
limits
the
voting
rights
that
an
entity
gains
when
it
purchases
a
specified
percentage
of
the
shares
of
an
indiana
corporation.
it
provides
that
the
purchaser
does
not
acquire
voting
rights
unless
the
remaining
shareholders
vote
to
grant
such
rights.
appellee,
dynamics
corporation,
made
a
tender
offer
for
18%
of
the
shares
of
appellant
cts,
a
corporation
of
indiana.
when
cts
invoked
the
provisions
of
the
indiana
act,
dynamics
sought
and
obtained
an
injunction
from
a
federal
district
court
in
illinois.
that
court
concluded
that
the
indiana
law
is
preempted
by
the
williams
act
and
also
violates
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
for
the
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
indiana
act
does
not
conflict
with
any
expressed
provision
of
the
williams
act
nor
does
it
undermine
the
basic
purposes
of
that
act.
similarly,
we
conclude
that
the
indiana
law
does
not
violate
the
commerce
clause.
the
indiana
statute
applies
evenhandedly
to
tender
offers,
whether
they
are
initiated
by
residents
of
indiana
or
residents
of
other
states.
also,
the
indiana
statute
applies
only
to
the
governance
of
indiana
corporations.
therefore,
there
is
little
or
no
risk
of
inconsistent
regulation
by
other
states.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
part
of
which
justices
blackmun
and
stevens
have
joined.
