mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
see
if
i
can
clarify
justice
scalia's
and
justice
stevens'
concern
over
the
mathematics
here,
because
it
is
important.
let's
take
this
case.
bidder,
my
client,
owned
approximately
27
percent.
to
may
it
easier,
if
the
bidder
had
owned
20
percent
and
if
the
insiders
who
also
have
interested
shares
and
were
disqualified
from
voting,
if
they
owned
another
ten
percent
that's
70
percent...
that's
30
percent
which
leaves
70
percent.
the
statute
requires
a
majority
of
the
disinterested
shares
outstanding,
but
in
all
these
cases...
in
no
case
do
all
the
shareholders
vote.
the
average
is
about,
let's
say,
ten
percent.
now
we
are
down
to
60
percent--
the
statute
also
has
a
strange
quirk
because
it
doesn't
disqualify
the
shares
of
directors
who
are
not
officers
of
the
corporation,
but
we
know
because
of
structural
bias
who
it
is
who
puts
those
directors
in.
it's
management,
and
those
folks
are
going
to
vote
for
management
for
sure,
not
to
give
the
vote
to
a
prospective
bidder
here.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
ten
percent
generally...
that's
an
oversimplification
but
for
purposes
of
this
hypothetical
you
never
get
all
the
shareholders
of
a
public
corporation
to
vote.
so,
if
you
take
it...
we
are
down,
now,
justice
scalia,
to
50
percent
and
the
bidder
has
to
get
36
percent
of
that
50
percent
which
is
over
70
percent,
as
justice
stevens
figured
out.
that
is
one
of
the
numerous
things
that
takes
this
level
playing
field
and
begins
to
tilt
it
against
the
bidder.
i
think
that's
a
good
introduction
to
the
place
i
think
this
case
ought
to
start
and
that
is
with
judge
posner's
comments
in
his
opinion,
his
lingering
doubts
about
whether
or
not
the
williams
act
really
pre-empts
state
takeover
statutes
such
as
this.
and
to
put
it
in
terms
that
this
court
has
stated
on
numerous
occasions,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
state
regulation
or
statute
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
accomplishing
the
purposes
and
the
objectives
of
the
williams
act.
now,
if
we
remove
these
lingering
doubts,
and
if
your
honors
in
this
case
do
that,
then
it
becomes
unnecessary
to
get
into
the
great
silences
of
the
commerce
clause
and
it
becomes
unnecessary
to
go
into
the
second
branch
that's
troubled
the
lower
courts
in
all
of
these
cases,
which
is
trying
to
figure
out
whether
this
is
a
strict
scrutiny
kind
of
case
or
whether
it's
a
pike-balancing
test
case.
the
focus
ought
to
be,
at
least,
first
on
the
williams
act
because
i
believe
that
justice
white's
opinion,
the
plurality
opinion,
was
quite
correct.
i
think
"crystal
clear"
is
what
he
said.
and
that
is
that
the
williams
act's
principal
purpose
is
to
protect
the
shareholder,
to
protect
the
autonomy
of
the
investor,
and
that
autonomy
is
protected
by
maintaining
this
neutrality
between
the
bidder
on
the
one
hand
and
management
on
the
other.
that
is
the
way
that
the
shareholder's
interest
is
protected.
now,
the
indiana
chapter
and
the
other
controlled
share
chapters
like
it
in
other
states,
tilt
that
balance
drastically
against
the
bidder
and
they
do
it
in
at
least
four
or
five
different
ways.
first
off,
they
introduced
this
element
of
delay,
and
there
is
at
least
a
22-day
delay
and
probably
more
because
election
contests
generally
occur
in
connection
with
what
we
are
talking
about,
which
is
a
proxy
contest
superimposed
on
a
tender
offer.
a
point
that
mr.
strain
and
mr.
pritchard
didn't
make
is
that
every
tender
offer,
every
tender
offer
for
an
indiana
corporation
necessarily
involves
a
proxy
contest.
that
is,
unless
management
says,
okay,
you
can
take
over
my
company.
but
that
doesn't
happen,
as
in
this
case.
what
happens
is
that
the
bidder
has
to
have
a
proxy
contest
with
management
to
try
to
get
these
votes,
the
50
percent
or
the
majority
of
the
disinterested
shares,
and
that
proxy
contest
is
an
immense
additional
burden
on
the
tender
offeror
which
the
williams
act
never
contemplated.
under
the
williams
act
a
tender
offeror
makes
a
tender,
sends
out
the
solicitations
to
all
the
shareholders,
and
the
shareholder
in
oregon
gets
this
letter
in
the
mail
that
says,
i'd
like
to
buy
your
shares
at
this
premium,
and
all
the
shareholder
has
to
do
is
say
yes
or
no.
in
this
case
we
need
a
proxy
contest
on
top
of
that.
next,
in
addition
to
the
delay,
there
is
the
uncertainty
because
a
tender
offer
involves
a
tremendous
amount
of
sunk
costs.
the
sunk
costs
include
all
of
the
legal
expenses
and
accounting
expenses
and
printing
and
mailing.
in
addition
to
that,
in
order
to
line
up
a
tender
offer
that
makes
any
sense
at
all,
you
have
to
be
able
to
say
to
the
shareholders
of
the
corporation,
we
have
the
financing
lined
up
to
be
able
to
make
this
tender
offer.
that
financing
involves
commitment
fees
with
merchant
bankers
and
investment
bankers
usually
in
the
range
of
one
to
one
and
a
half
percent,
and
on
a
$100
million
tender
offer,
which
is
not
a
large
one,
that's
a
million
and
a
half
dollars.
so,
we
are
talking
about
a
tender
offeror
committing
to
spend
two
to
three
million
dollars
up
front
which
he'll
never
get
back
at
all
if,
as
judge
posner
put
it,
the
tender
mercies
of
these
outside
shareholders,
the
disinterested
shareholders,
don't
give
that
tender
offeror
the
vote.
the
statute
is
truly
a
gauntlet
through
which
the
bidder
has
to
run
in
order
to
get
the
vote,
in
order
to
accomplish
his
or
her
principal
goal
in
making
a
tender
offer,
which
is
getting
control.
the
deck
is
stacked
against
the
bidder
and
it's
stacked
against
the
bidder
because
of
the
vote
that
i
discussed
earlier.
it's
also
stacked
against
the
bidder
because
it
takes
away
investor
autonomy.
the
purpose
of
the
williams
act
is
to
provide
information
to
the
investor,
to
the
shareholder,
so
that
he
or
she
can
make
an
independent
judgment,
shall
i
tender
my
shares
or
not.
and
justice
o'connor
asked
a
question
earlier,
this
is
a
strange
way
to
protect
shareholders'
votes.
you
say
to
the
20
percent
shareholder,
your
votes
are
stripped
away
unless
you
go
through
all
these
hoops
in
order
to
get
a
majority
of
the
disinterested
vote,
and
what
it
says
to
the
shareholder
who
is
in
oregon
who
would
like
to
tender
his
or
her
shares
to
the
bidder
in
connecticut
or
florida
is,
you
can't
do
it.
you
can't
tender
your
shares
unless
the
bidder
runs
this
gauntlet
and
is
able
to
get
a
majority
of
the
supposedly
disinterested
shareholders
to
vote.
so,
the
process,
looked
at
in
a
very
practical
way
that
indiana
imposes
on
the
bidder,
is
a
stacked
deck.
just
last
night...
every
time
i
read
the
statute
i
come
up
with
something
else,
another
little
hoop
to
go
through.
i
really
discovered
this
one.
it's
not
in
our
briefs
but
it's
in
the
statute.
the
statute
provides
for
record
date
of
70
days
before
the
meeting.
that's
in
another
section.
it's
in
2330.
the
controlled
share
act
requires
a
meeting
if
requested
by
an
acquiring
person,
within
50
days
but
that
is
50
days.
if
the
management
sets
a
record
date
20
days
earlier,
that
means
that
there
are
20
days
of
trading
during
which
shareholders
of
that
corporation
will
have
sold
their
stock
but
still
be
record
date
shareholders
for
purposes
of
voting
on
whether
or
not
this
tender
offeror
has
the
right
to
vote
these
shares.
those
shareholders
are
going
to
get
this
proxy
thing
in
the
mail
and
they
couldn't
give
two
hoots
whether
or
not
the
bidder
gets
the
vote
or
doesn't
get
the
vote
because
they
are
out
of
the
corporation.
and
it's
like
a
little
archeological
dig
to
go
through
that
chapter
but
it
is
filled,
as
i
said,
with
these
pitfalls
which
tend
to
keep
inclining
that
balance
that
congress
in
the
williams
act
said
ought
to
be
neutral,
ought
to
establish
this
neutrality,
keeps
sloping
it
against
the
bidder.
what
it
adds
up
to
is
that
it
chills
tender
offers
and
deters
them
because
it
is
true
that
no
rational
tender
offeror
is
going
to
run
this
gauntlet,
incur
these
expenses,
and
risk
all
this
uncertainty
where
there
is
no
guarantee,
and
in
a
process
that
is
totally
controlled
by
management
when
there
is
no
guarantee
that
at
the
end
of
the
line
he
is
going
to
have
the
one
thing
he
is
looking
for
which
is
this
vote,
the
vote
which
exists
in
the
national
market
for
corporate
control.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
a
lot
more,
and
perhaps
in
order
not
to
overstate
my
case
i
shouldn't...
i
can
use
the
word
"deter"
because
i
lived
with
this
tender
offer
in
particular
and
my
client
would
no
more
make
that
tender
offer
and
put
up
the
money
that
was
necessary
to
purchase
the
shares
unless
there
was
certainty
that
the
indiana
statute
was
declared
unconstitutional
for
one
reason
or
the
other.
what
i
am
really
saying
is
that
no
tender
offeror
will
take
all
of
these
chances
to
make
a
tender
offer
when
this
kind
of
a
mine
field
is
in
front
of
him
or
her.
it
just
won't
be
done.
now,
let
me
back
off
that
for
a
minute.
chilling
means
interfering
or
deterring.
you
are
adding
additional
burdens
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
always
impossible
for
a
tender
offeror
to
say,
well,
i'm
going
to
take
all
these
chances
and
make
these
tender
offers
anyway.
that's
not...
that
really
isn't
the
way
i
read
the
legislative
history
of
the
williams
act.
i
read
it
as
meaning
that
congress
said
that
there
is
to
be
this
neutrality
in
order
to
accomplish
the
goal
that
none
of
us
disagrees
about.
we
all
agree
that
the
principal
goal
is
to
protect
shareholders
and
to
protect
investors.
there
is
a
disagreement
about
whether
or
not
that
neutrality...
i
think
both
justice
stevens
and
justice
powell
raised
this
in
the
<mite>
[=
mite]
case...
the
question
is
whether
that
neutrality
is
an
eternal
neutrality
to
the
williams
act
or
whether
it's
something
that's
projected
out
onto
the
states.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
get
into
that
thicket
because
i
think
it's
clear
that
when
you
focus
on
protection
of
the
investor...
this
is
justice
o'connor's
point...
the
investor's
autonomy
is
taken
away
by
the
indiana
statute.
the
investor
may
not
tender
his
or
her
shares
without
all
these
other
things
happening,
and
shareholders...
not
even
a
control
shareholder;
a
shareholder
who
only
acquires
20
percent,
20.5
percent
of
the
corporation
and,
as
we
learned
in
this
bidder
proxy
fight
here,
we
had
27
percent,
my
client,
we
lost
the
proxy
fight
by
a
very
slim
margin.
every
day
in
the
wall
street
journal
we
read
about
proxy
fights
for
public
companies
in
which
shareholders
with
major
stakes
in
the
company
lose
them.
judge
posner's
view
is
that
only
50
percent
guarantees
control.
we
can
debate
that.
i
think
49
percent
probably
guarantees
control.
but
certainly
in
the
theoretical
sense,
50
percent
is
needed.
so,
my
point
is
that
it's
not
necessary
to
get
to
the
commerce
clause,
the
intricacies
of
the
commerce
clause
in
order
to
affirm
the
seventh
circuit
here
and
to
make
it
unnecessary
for
the
courts
and
litigants
to
do
battle
in
the
constitutional
vineyards.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
you
may
not.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
i
certainly
do.
on
the
commerce
clause
point,
the
unifying
principle
that
i
see
in
the
commerce
case
is
a
look
first
at
the
local
interests,
the
legitimacy
of
the
local
interest
that
is
to
be
protected,
and
then
whether
it's
the
strict
kind
of
scrutiny
test
under
hughes
or
under
lewis
or
whether
it's
the
balancing
test
under
pike.
you
have
to
look
at
the
burden
and
the
extent
of
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
in
the--
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
--surely.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
you
are
asking
about
the
limiting
principle,
where
does
all
this
stop,
and
is
it
really
true
as
appellants
say
that
an
affirmance
here
is
going
to
end
up
federalizing
all
the
state
corporation
law.
the
answer
is
no,
and
the
answer
is
no
on
the
basis
of
sound
traditional
principles
that
have
governed
corporations.
the
difference
between
a
merger,
a
dissolution,
a
sale
of
all
the
assets,
staggered
boards,
things
like
that,
is
that
those
are
either
transactions
directly
involving
the
corporation
of
a
very
profoundly
fundamental
nature.
if
you
merge,
a
corporation
can
be
merged
out
of
existence.
if
a
corporation
is
dissolved,
of
course
that
requires
shareholder
vote.
and
if
a
corporation
is
dissolved
that
requires
shareholder
vote
also.
if
a
corporation
is
going
to
sell
substantially
all
of
its
assets,
that
requires
the
shareholder
vote
too.
staggered
boards
and
cumulative
voting
of
course
are
going
to
have
some
sort
of
an
impact
on
the
interstate
market
for
corporate
control.
but
the
issue
is,
is
the
state
operating
within
its
traditional
sphere
of
corporate
governance
activity
involving
the
corporate
transaction...
and
all
of
the
transactions
mr.
strain
and
mr.
pritchard
and
i
think
your
honor
have--
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
--if
that
happened
midstream
and
that
was
where
i
part
with
the
government
in
this
case,
if
that
happened
in
midstream,
let's
say
that
indiana
passed
a
statute
that
says
no
one
can
own
and
vote
more
than
five
percent
of
the
stock
of
a
corporation,
that
would
make
it
almost
impossible
for
that
corporation
to
be
taken
over
by
any
other
corporation.
that
kind
of
statutory
provision
would
fail
under
the
commerce
clause
analysis,
and
i
believe
under
the
williams
act.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
that's
this
statute.
in
effect--
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
--part
of
the
statute
is
that
you
don't
get
the
vote,
the
bidder
doesn't
get
the
vote,
without
the
vote
of
these
so-called
disinterested
shareholders.
i
am
taking
that
one
step
further
because
it
is
the
principle
advanced
by
indiana
that
i
think
has
no
limitation
and
it
has
no
stop.
they
say
that
anything
that
affects
the
voting
rights
is
something
which
is
permissible
in
the
state's
sphere
of
regulation,
so
that
i
guess
they
come
here
with
a
straight
face
and
say
that
if
indiana--
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
--what
i
am
saying
is
that
that's
this
statute,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
believe
that
this
statute
fails
both
under
the
williams
act
and
under
the
commerce
clause
because
it
is
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
purpose
of
the
williams
act
and
because
it
does
unduly
burden
interstate
commerce.
i
was
trying
to
make
the
point
with
a
hypothetical
which
takes
it
a
little
further
and
that
is,
if
indiana
had
said
you
have
to
have
90
percent,
a
90
percent
vote,
there's
a
point
out
there
at
which
these
fundamental
corporate
matters
that
your
honor
is
addressing
now
would
become
impediments,
would
become
obstacles
under
the
williams
act
and
burdens
under
interstate
commerce.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
i
think
that
may
be
true
but
i
think
that
that's
got
to
be
a
political
decision
in
the
interstate
market
for
corporate
control
that
ought
to
be
done
by
congress
and
not
by
individual
states.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
true
if
this
were
the
51st
state
that
were
incorporated
behind
some
john
rolls
veil
of
ignorance
and
there
were
no
shares
outstanding,
i
think
that
analysis
would
be
absolutely
correct.
but
what
we
are
saving
is
that
in
midstream...
indiana
of
course
has
launched
all
these
shares.
they
are
all
out
there
trading
in
interstate
commerce
right
now,
and
if
in
midstream
indiana
or
any
other
state
says,
we're
changing
the
rules
and
we're
going
to
prohibit
a
transfer
of
shares
in
effect
from
one
shareholder
to
another,
i
believe
that
under
those
circumstances
it
runs
afoul
of
both
the
williams
act
and
the
commerce
clause.
there
is
a
difference
between
starting
on
a
clean
slate
and
interfering
with
commerce
in
both
the
shares
and
in
corporate
control
that
already
exist,
because
that
commerce--
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
--if
a
state
wanted
to
do
something
as
foolish
as
to
have
two
different
kinds
of
voting
requirements...
that
is
grandfather
clause...
i
think
it
probably
would
be.
it
probably
would
be
because
in
that
sense
there
would
be
no
frustration
of
any
expectation
of
people
who
trade
in
the
market
for
corporate
control
or
for
corporate
shares.
so,
i
think
if
a
state
wanted
to
make
that
distinction
it
would
be
okay.
it's
imposing
it
in
the
middle
upon
shares
that
are
already
being
traded
in
interstate
commerce
that's
the
vice.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
the
target
corporation
starts
out,
of
course,
justice
white,
governed
by
the
particular
laws
of
the
chartering
state.
i
guess--
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
--it's
a
book-of-the-month,
sort
of,
it's
a
negative
enrollment
scheme
in
indiana.
all
the
corporations
are
covered
in
august
of...
in
this
month
unless
you
opt
out,
which
of
course
is
one
of
the
problems
of
that
statute
because
that
is
the
one
that
permits
the
discrimination
in
favor
of
indiana
corporations.
it's
a
little
bit
like
the
court's
decision
in
the
raymond
case
on
truck
lengths,
where
one
of
the
reasons
the
statute
was
struck
down
was
because
the
regulatory
scheme
permitted
the
regulators
to
discriminate
in
favor
of
the
wisconsin
trucks.
but
you
are
right,
justice
white,
and
that
is
that
the
corporations
can
opt
out
which
is
again
one
of
the
problems
with
the
statute
that
causes
it
to
be
discriminatory
at
the
option
of
management
in
favor
of
the
indiana
corporations.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
i
might
lose
you,
justice.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
because
if
the
management
of
an
indiana
corporation
is
faced
with
a
friendly...
management
opts
in
the
statute,
it
doesn't
opt
out
after
august
of
'87,
so
they
are
within
the
statute
and
they
are
opposing
a
prospective
takeover
by
a
connecticut
corporation
or
a
new
york
corporation,
and
what
they
do
then
is
they
arrange
to
have
a
friendly
takeover
with
an
indiana
corporation
and
then
they
can
simply
opt
out
of
the
statute.
that
is,
opting
out
means
that
indiana
corporation
or
any
corporation
it
favors
can
acquire
the
vote
without
having
to
have--
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
--or
any
friendly
corporation.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
that's
true.
what
it
does
is--
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
--but
it
puts
in
management's
hands,
justice
scalia,
the
option
to
be
able
to
say,
i
favor
this
prospective
bidder
over
the
other
one,
which
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
williams
act
and
the
tender
offer.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
different
point.
that's
on
the
commerce
clause.
another
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
mr.
strain
in
the
beginning
of
his
presentation
indicated
that
perhaps
there
was
a
misstatement
in
cts's
reply
brief,
and
it
is
an
important
one
because
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case,
two
branches
of
the
government,
the
government...
that
is,
the
justice
department
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
both
the
justice
department
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
support
dca,
our
position,
and
that
is
that
the
commerce
clause
renders
the
indiana
statute
invalid
because
of
the
excessive
burdens.
but
in
the
reply
brief
cts
says
in
effect
that
the
sec
also
throws
in
the
towel
on
the
williams
act;
that
is,
that
the
sec
says
that
the
williams
act
does
not
pre-empt
the
field.
it
is
an
important
point,
that
that
is
not
the
case;
that
the
government's
brief
is
very
carefully
drafted
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
only
the
justice
department
and
not
the
sec
that
says
the
williams
act
doesn't
pre-empt
the
statute,
because
of
course
the
sec
argued
in
mite,
the
sec
argued
in
kidwell,
the
sec
argued
in
household
in
the
delaware
supreme
court
that
the
williams
act
did
in
fact
pre-empt
those
state
statutes
because
it
was
an
obstacle
to
tender
offers,
got
in...
as
they
say,
got
in
the
way.
the
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
make,
which
is
also
raised
in
the
reply
brief
that
was
filed
by
cts
and
we
didn't
have,
obviously,
a
chance
to
respond
in
writing,
is
this
notion
that
this
is
only
a
private
matter,
private
individuals,
and
the
state
really
isn't
involved
in
the
obstacles
to
the
williams
act
or
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
that
point
is
sort
of
stunning
because
indiana
has
enacted
a
blueprint,
a
very
detailed
blueprint
here,
under
which
the
corporations
chartered
by
the
state
of
indiana
can
invoke
these
burdens
and
obstacles
and
it's
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
analysis
that
this
court
has
done
on
many
occasions
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
finding
state
action
means
finding
a
state
that
provides
an
impetus
or
a
blueprint
for
private
individuals
to
violate
rights.
obviously,
only
states
can
violate
the
commerce
clause
in
the
same
sense
that
individuals
generally
have
their
rights
that
are
violated
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
that,
this
blueprint
is
such
a
complete
and
detailed
prescription
for
management
of
target
corporations
that
it
is
very
clear
that
the
state
is
behind
this.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
yes,
it
would,
justice
scalia.
it
would
violate
the
commerce
clause
if
it
said
shares
are
not
transferable
and
those
shares
have
already
come
to
rest
in
the
hands
of
all
of
the
shareholders
in
the
country.
it
would
violate
the
commerce
clause
because
it
would
be...
it
would
place
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
that
had
no
relationship
i
can
think
of,
as
i
stand
here
now,
to
a
legitimate
corporate
concern
of
the
state.
i
don't...
maybe
you
can
help
me,
but
i
can't
think
of
any
right
now,
to
make
shares
not
transferable.
corporations
would--
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
--it
would
be
okay
in
the
future.
it
would
be
okay
if
it
didn't
upset
the
present
market
for
these
goods
and
these
items,
yes,
it
would
have
to
be
in
order
for
my
analysis
to
be
consistent
and
correct.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
it's
because
there
is
a
present
market.
there
is
a
present
market
in
the
country
for
the
shares
of
a
corporation
that's
chartered
in
indiana.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
i
think
that
that's
a
different
situation.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
because,
your
honor,
my
example
maybe
works
better
with
a
new
state
rather
than
taking
a
state
which
changes
the
law
prospectively,
there
is
no
commerce
in
the
shares
of
the
new
state,
the
51st
state,
and
there
is
no
commerce,
i
think
in
the
shares
of
the
new
corporation
in
"x"
state
as
to
which
there
is
no
transferability
or
no
vote.
so
that,
any
corporation
that
is
foolish
enough
to
incorporate
in
a
state
that
had
that
kind
of
restriction,
you'd
be
unable
to
raise
capital.
the
capital
markets
would
walk
away
from
a
corporation
like
that
in
a
flash.
if
you
take
that
state
chartered
corporation
with
those
kinds
of
restrictions
and
do
it
willingly,
then
you
subject
yourself
to
those
restrictions.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
your
honor,
in
exxon...
i
view
exxon
as
analogous
to
the
blue
sky
laws
because
it
had
to
do
with
products
coming
into
maryland
and
it
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
state
regulation
there
didn't
interfere
with
the
ability
of
interstate
suppliers
to
sell
their
wares
in
maryland.
it
only
said
that
vertically
integrated
suppliers
couldn't
have
retail
outlets
in
maryland
but
it
didn't
deprive
maryland
of
the
opportunity
to
have
a
full
range
of
petroleum
products
and
at
the
same
time...
i
think
it
was
justice
stevens
who
said
that
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
require
that
interstate
markets
be
totally
efficient.
there
was
some
inefficiency
involved
in
that
but
it
didn't
stop...
it
didn't
stop
the
products
from
coming
at
all
into
maryland.
they
came
in,
in
a
different
way.
mr.
lowell
e.
sachnoff
i
think,
again
from
a
practical
point
of
view
as
i
see
the
decisions
in
this
court
on
the
commerce
clause,
the
focus
is
on
the
practical
impact
of
the
statutes
from
a
practical
point
of
view.
it
stops
the
connecticut
bidder
from
buying
a
share
from
the
oregon
shareholder
in
this
market
that
really
has
next
to
nothing
to
do
with
the
internal
governance
matters
of
a
corporation.
my
last
point
is
to
respond
to
justice
powell's
point
about
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
designed
to
protect
state
businesses
and
i
think
the
state
of
indiana's
brief
indicates
that
it
is
designed
to
check
the
removal
of
indiana
corporations.
and
my
point
there
is
that
there
are
lots
more
less
intrusive
ways
of
doing
that
than
interfering
with
interstate
commerce
or
setting
up
an
obstacle
to
tender
offers
under
the
williams
act.
the
states
have
senators
who
can
lobby
in
the
national
congress.
states
really
ought
to,
if
they
want
to
attract
and
keep
business,
they
can
set
up
silicon
valleys
and
route
ones.
they
can
provide
tax
subsidies
for
industries.
but
that's
the
kind
of
competition
i
think
the
commerce
clause
was
designed
to
stimulate
among
the
states.
lastly,
the
ingenuity
of
corporate
takeover
lawyers
apparently
knows
no
bounds.
they
come
up
with
the
evolution
of
poison
pills
which
have
been
upheld
by
the
courts
as
a
means
of
blocking
or
thwarting
unwanted
takeovers.
so,
there
are
presently
in
place
structures
that
can
accomplish
the
goal,
the
concern
that
i
believe
justice
powell
raised
both
in
the
mite
case
and
here
today.
if
there
are
no
other
questions?
