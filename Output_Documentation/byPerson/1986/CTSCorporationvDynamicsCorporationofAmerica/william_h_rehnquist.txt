h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
strain.
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
we
will

from
you
now,
mr.
pritchard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pritchard.
we
will
hear
argument
from
you
now,
mr.
sachnoff.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
sachnoff,
when
you
said
ten
percent
about
the
number
of
shareholders,
did
you
mean
ten
percent
don't
vote?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
sachnoff,
if
you
use
the
term
"chill"
to
mean
in
any
way
discourage,
as
some
of
our
cases
have
used
that
term,
any
added
state
requirement
to
federal
requirements
will
"chill",
in
a
sense.
it's
always
harder
to
complete
an
additional
requirement.
your
argument
is
something
more
here,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sachnoff.
the
case
is
submitted.

justice

a

announced
by
