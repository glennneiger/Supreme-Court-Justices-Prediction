mr.
james
a.
strain
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principle
this
court
must
consider
in
this
case
is
the
federalist
intention
between
the
power
of
indiana
to
define
the
bundle
of
rights
inherent
in
indiana
created
corporations
and
the
implicit
limitation
on
that
power
derived
from
the
commerce
clause
when
congress
has
not
acted.
there
was
a
different
holding
as
well
in
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion,
and
that
was
a
pre-emption
holding.
but
the
centerpiece
of
that
holding
and
dca's
argument,
i
might
say,
is
that
it
is
possible
that
in
light
of
the
controlled
share
acquisition
statute
under
consideration
today,
a
hostile
bidder
might
wish
to
keep
his
tender
offer
open
for
50
days
instead
of
the
28-day
or
20
business
day
minimum
currently
required
by
rule
14(e)1
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
unlike
the
position
the
united
states
took
in
this
court
in
mite,
in
this
case
the
united
states
has
argued
that
the
statute
is
not
pre-empted.
morever,
the
sec
has
taken
no
exception
to
that
position.
the
sec,
indeed,
is
a
signator
on
the
brief
in
the
same
sense
as
being
a
part
of
the
brief.
and
i
might
say
to
the
court
as
well,
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
the
sec
did
not
join
in
that
portion
of
the
united
states'
argument
but
similarly
there
are
portions
of
the
commerce
clause
that
only
refer
to
the
united
states.
it
strikes
me,
therefore,
that
the
sec
disagreed.
it
should
have
said
so,
and
it
has
not.
the
fundamental
issue,
then,
before
this
court
is
whether
the
dormant
commerce
clause
limits
the
ability
of
indiana
to
enact
a
statute
that
concededly
does
not
discriminate
between
in-state
and
out-of-state
acquirers;
that
unlike
the
statute
this
court
considered
in
mite,
does
not
pose
any
possibility
of
multiple
and
inconsistent
burdens
that
presents
no
different
kind
of
alleged
burdens
on
interstate
commerce
than
any
number
of
other
corporate
statutes
regulating
the
relationships
inter
sese
among
shareholders
of
indiana
created
corporations.
mr.
james
a.
strain
of
course.
mr.
james
a.
strain
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
james
a.
strain
it
is
my
belief
that
is
not
the
purpose.
mr.
james
a.
strain
based
on
the
theory
that
we
argue,
justice
o'connor,
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
james
a.
strain
ultimately,
that
has
to
be
the
purpose.
mr.
james
a.
strain
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
james
a.
strain
stripping
the
shareholders
of
the
vote,
of
course,
is
one
way
to
put
what
goes
on.
but
it
is
no
more
peculiar,
if
you
will,
than
a
statute
involving
mergers
where
precisely
the
same
result
obtains.
that
is
that
the
shareholders...
that
is
a
sufficiently
important
interest,
at
least
as
defined
by
virtually
every
state
corporate
statute
of
which
i
am
aware,
that
the
shareholders
have
the
right
to
vote
on
whether
a
transaction
should
go
forward.
and
if
the
shareholders
say
no,
then
no
less
in
this
case,
somebody
who
lives
in
california
who
owns
shares
in
the
indiana
corporation
is
prevented
from
selling
those
shares
one
way
or
another
to
a
new
york
based
corporation
located
in
connecticut.
it
is
precisely
what
happens
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
strain
this
court
squarely
held
in
aldridge
that
among
the
bundle
of
rights
that
the
state
creates
is
the
right
of
transferability.
the
state
therefore
could
pass
a
statute
that
ultimately
says,
there
shall
be
no
transfer
at
all
of
any
rights
in
connection
with
the
shares.
now,
it
might
be
economically
foolish
to
do
so,
and
indeed
i
believe
it
would
be
economically
foolish
to
do
so.
mr.
james
a.
strain
indeed
i
do
not.
in
fact,
the
government
so
argues
in
its
argument
when
it
tells
us
that
it
is
possible
to
structure
a
corporate
statute
that
says,
there
shall
be
no
transfers
when
there
is
a
possibility
for
someone
to
own
more
than
20
percent
of
the
outstanding
shares
of
the
corporation.
mr.
james
a.
strain
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
scalia.
mr.
james
a.
strain
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
is--
mr.
james
a.
strain
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
strain
well,
i
don't
view
what
i
have
said
as
a
concession.
it's
perfectly
possible,
as
the
state
of
indiana
has
argued
in
its
brief,
that
the
shareholders
of
an
indiana
created
corporation
can
take
those
kinds
of
considerations
into
account.
but
it
isn't
necessary,
and
ultimately
it's
the
shareholders
who
get
to
decide.
it's
not
the
state
of
indiana
that
gets
to
decide,
which
again
is
unlike
the
situation
in
mite.
remember
that
ultimately
what
occurs
is
that
shareholders
get
to
vote,
and
if
the
shareholders
decide
that
they
are
better
off
with
somebody
from
outside
the
state
saying,
we
want
your
company,
that's
the
way
it
goes.
if
this
is
a
way
to
preserve
indiana
corporations
in
indiana,
it
fails.
one
of
the
benefits
and
the
burdens
of
the
indiana
business
corporation
law
is
this
statute.
shareholders
in
certain
limited
indiana
corporations
have
been
provided
the
right
to
vote
unless
they
or
the
board
of
directors
say
otherwise,
and
by
that
of
course
the
shareholders
themselves
can
opt
out
of
this
kind
of
statute
by
an
amendment
to
the
articles
of
incorporation.
the
board
of
directors
can
opt
out
by
virtue
of
a
by-law
amendment.
but
in
all
events,
if
that
occurs
or
fails
to
occur,
then
the
shareholders
are
given
the
opportunity
to
have
voting
rights
to
determine
whether
someone
acquires
one-fifth
or
more,
one-third
or
more,
or
one-half
or
more
of
the
voting
power
of
an
indiana
corporation.
if
the
grant
of
voting
power
is
approved,
then
shareholders
properly
exercising
dissenter's
rights
in
the
same
way
they
are
granted
dissenter's
rights
in
merger
transactions,
can
seek
and
obtain
appraisal.
the
state
of
indiana
has
concluded
that
this
potential
change
in
status
of
a
shareholder
is
sufficiently
significant
that
the
shareholder
should
have
a
say
in
the
outcome.
the
effect
of
such
an
acquisition
of
control
could
be
effectively
to
disenfranchise
them.
take
as
an
example,
if
someone
acquires
an
excess
of
50
percent
of
the
outstanding
voting
power
of
a
corporation,
the
remaining
shareholders
have
utterly
no
vote
in
their
future.
the
united
states
agrees
with
the
state
of
indiana
that
the
shareholders
have
a
significant
interest
in
the
outcome
of
that
kind
of
change
of
control.
cts
submits
that
none
of
dca,
the
seventh
circuit,
or
even
the
united
states
has
identified
for
this
court
a
constitutionally
cognizable
line
that
says
on
the
one
hand,
the
control
share
acquisition
statute
impermissibly
burdens
interstate
commerce
and
on
the
other
hand,
any
of
a
number
of
statutes
implicating
the
passing
of
control,
such
as
cumulative
voting
rights,
merger
transactions,
super-majority
requirements
for
mergers,
provisions
for
staggered
boards,
or
even
the
ability
to
vote
annually
for
directors
or
a
class
of
directors
do
not.
if
the
court
constitutionalizes
state
corporate
law
in
this
case,
there
is
no
doctrinal
bright
line
to
prohibit
the
same
result
in
any
of
a
number
of
a
long
list
of
attributes
of
virtually
every
corporate
statute
that
can
be
alleged
to
impede
the
so-called
interstate
market
for
corporate
control.
yet,
these
are
provisions
that
have
inhered
in
the
corporate
statutes
for
years
without
any
serious
question
of
constitutionality.
if
the
control
share
acquisition
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
different
or
it
is
new,
then
the
states
are
effectively
prohibited
from
taking
into
account
future
changes
in
economy.
corporations
are
exclusively
creatures
of
state
law.
they
exist,
if
at
all,
because
a
given
state
enacted
a
statute
allowing
the
corporation
to
come
into
existence,
and
accepted
articles
of
incorporation
that
complied
with
that
statute.
most
importantly,
when
anyone
determines
to
purchase
a
share
of
stock
in
a
corporation
chartered
by
a
state,
he
also
buys
the
bundle
of
rights
and
the
obligations
defined
by
the
totality
of
the
chartering
state's
laws.
that
is
and
must
be
true
whether
the
shares
are
sold
exclusively
intrastate
or
in
interstate
commerce.
that
bundle
of
rights
inherent
in
a
share
of
stock
governs
everything
from
the
value
on
liquidation
and
dissolution,
the
rights
to
dividends,
if
any,
the
ability
to
participate
in
shareholders
meetings,
if
at
all,
the
amount
of
that
participation,
and
the
kinds
of
issues
in
which
participation
is
allowed,
all
the
way
through
to
whether
the
share
of
stock
can
be
transferred
as
in
aldridge,
and
if
so,
under
what
conditions.
the
very
existence
and
nature
of
voting
rights
is
solely
a
function
of
the
chartering
state's
law,
whether
the
share
of
stock
is
traded
in
interstate
commerce
or
in
intrastate
commerce.
indeed,
it
couldn't
be
any
other
way
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
no
magic
transformation
occurs
in
a
share
of
stock
when
the
share
is
placed
in
interstate
commerce.
state
law,
not
federal
law,
still
governs
the
voting
rights.
and
to
date
no
one
has
suggested,
at
least
directly
that,
one
share,
one
vote,
has
been
imposed
on
the
chartering
state's
law
by
the
commerce
clause.
indeed,
to
the
contrary,
one
only
has
to
remember
that
under
the
common
law
it
was
the
shareholder
who
had
one
vote,
not
vote
based
on
the
number
of
shares.
delaware
has
chartered
corporations
where
it
was
possible
under
the
articles
of
incorporation
for
a
person
to
have
declining
voting
rights
as
the
share
power
increased.
as
the
united
states
at
least
recognizes,
necessarily
there
will
be
so-called
extraterritorial
effects
of
the
chartering
state's
law
because
the
benefits
and
burdens
constitutionally
must
follow
the
stock
wherever
it
goes.
thus,
and
pursuant
to
a
chartering
state's
statutory
merger
procedure,
the
will
of
the
majority
or
super-majority
of
the
shareholders
is
that
a
merger
not
occur,
then
it
will
not
occur
even
though
the
practical
effect
is
to
stop
a
new
york
corporation
from
acquiring
an
indiana
corporation
and
stopping
a
shareholder
from
california
from
selling...
the
ability
to
sell
shares.
indeed,
under
the
merger
statutes,
if
the
directors
don't
even
submit
the
proposal
to
the
shareholders
at
all,
the
shareholders
never
get
the
right
to
vote
at
all.
no
one,
not
dca,
not
the
seventh
circuit,
not
even
the
united
states,
has
suggested
that
such
a
merger
statute
impermissibly
burdens
interstate
commerce,
even
though
it
quite
obviously
potentially
stops
the
interstate,
international
commerce
of
control.
even
though
the
united
states
concedes
the
fundamental
premises
on
which
the
cts
argument
rests,
it
nonetheless
argues
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause
because
its
provisions
on
voting
rights
are
triggered
by
purchase
and
sale,
what
they
call
transactions
involving
shares,
and
although
there
is
no
facial
discrimination
between
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce,
most
of
these
transactions
as
they
are
called
would
take
place
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
statute
preserves
whatever
pattern
of
voting
rights
exists
at
a
given
time
against
transactions
that
would
alter
that
pattern
in
significant
ways.
but
each
of
the
united
states'
points
is
refuted
either
by
decisions
of
this
court,
or
its
own
argument.
that
there
can
be
transactions
at
all
is
purely
a
function
of
state
law.
this
court
squarely
held
that
in
aldridge.
transferability
of
shares
in
a
corporation
stems
from
state
law.
characterizing
the
triggering
event
for
application
of
the
statute
as
a
"transaction"
adds
nothing
to
the
analysis.
the
easiest
way
to
demonstrate
that
for
the
court's
purposes
is
to
take
a
look
at
the
partnership
laws.
again,
partnerships
are
creatures
of
states.
state
laws
inherently
say,
virtually
without
exception,
you
cannot
transfer
the
voting
power
inherent
in
a
unit
of
a
limited
partnership
or
inherent
in
a
general
partnership
interest
without
the
agreement
of
somebody
else,
either
the
general
partners
or
the
limited
partners
as
the
case
may
be.
if
this
statute
falls
on
that
basis,
likewise
every
partnership
law
has
to
fall
on
the
same
basis
because
those
are
transactions
where
the
economic
benefits
are
transferred
and
the
voting
rights
are,
to
use
the
term
so
often
used
by
the
other
side
and
by
the
court,
stripped
by
virtue
of
the
transaction.
to
bring
it
home,
one
of
the
hottest
products
hitting
the
intrastate
market
today
is
units
in
master
limited
partnerships.
no
one
can
seriously
contend
that
state
partnership
laws
violate
the
commerce
clause
because
the
voting
rights
are
stripped
away,
even
though
that's
plainly
an
interstate
commerce
kind
of
transaction.
the
united
states
argument
says
that
most
transactions
occur
in
interstate
commerce,
but
that
likewise
adds
little
to
the
analysis.
this
court
has
totally
refuted
a
disproportionate
impact
theory
in
its
decision
in
exxon
and
in
its
decision
in
commonwealth
edison
co.
versus
montana
in
which
this
court
upheld
direct
burdens
which
fell
disproportionately
on
interstate
commerce.
morever,
if
there
is
an
impermissible
disproportionate
impact
arising
from
the
control
share
acquisition
statute,
that
must
be
equally
true
of
merger
statutes
because
in
mergers,
no
less
than
in
controlled
transactions,
the
shareholders
have
the
right
to
accept
or
reject
something
that
the
state
says
is
significantly
and
sufficiently
important
that
they
have
the
right
to
vote.
the
great
bulk
of
merger
transactions,
no
less
than
these
kinds
of
transactions,
will
occur
in
interstate
commerce.
the
united
states
has
apparently
recognized
this
particular
weakness
in
its
argument,
and
attempts
to
distinguish
mergers
because
they
involve
structural
changes.
but
i
have
found
no
evidence
in
decisions
of
this
court
or
in
the
constitution
itself
that
says
that
there
is
any
difference
between
structural
changes,
fundamental
changes,
transactional
changes
or
anything
else.
it
simply
does
not
arise
out
of
the
commerce
clause.
moreover,
mergers
are
often
accomplished
in
a
way
that--
mr.
james
a.
strain
--justice
scalia,
you
raise,
really
for
me
two
issues.
balancing
is
certainly
language
that
this
court
has
used
often,
but
it
is
possible
to
look
at
virtually
every
one
of
those
cases,
and
there
is
only
one
exception
cited
by
the
united
states,
as
either
a
discrimination
case
or
a
multiple
burden,
multiple
and
inconsistent
burden
case,
and
we
set
that
out
in
the
brief.
let
me
take
it
another
way
for
you.
the
state
defines
"structure".
that
is
the
starting
point,
so
it's
not
a
question
of
balancing
at
all.
it's
a
question
of
what
property
rights
does
the
state
give,
and
that's
for
the
state
to
define.
if
it
is
to
be
otherwise,
then
there
is
a
way
to
handle
the
problem
and
that
is
to
go
to
the
united
states
congress
where
these
kinds
of
issues
are
supposed
to
be,
and
have
the
united
states
congress
define
for
us
what
the
interstate
market
in
corporate
control
is.
but
historically,
that
hasn't
happened.
it
certainly
hasn't
happened
to
date.
have
i
responded
to
your
question
adequately?
we'll
find
out,
won't
we.
what
is
key
from
our
standpoint
is
whether
the
chartering
state
is
allowed
to
say,
or
allowed
to
believe
that
certain
changes
in
the
entity
owned
by
the
shareholders
are
so
important
that
the
shareholder
should
have
a
voice
in
whether
those
changes
occur.
whether
a
change
is
called
structural,
transactional
or
anything
else
has
little
to
do,
if
anything,
with
the
shareholder's
ultimate
interest.
again,
to
bring
that
home,
a
shareholder
is
as
cut
out
from
the
process
of
controlling
his
investment
that
if
a
single
dominant
shareholder
elects
the
board
of
directors
as
he
is
if
he
receives
a
nonvoting
preferred
stock
in
exchange
for
his
common
stock
in
a
merger
transaction.
the
effect
on
him
is
precisely
the
same.
