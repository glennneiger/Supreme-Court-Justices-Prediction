justice
scalia
you
deny
that
the
statute
would
have
the
effect
that
judge
posner
speculated
it
would?
justice
scalia
you
don't
think
it
would
have
any
effect
on
takeovers?
justice
scalia
where
they
occur?
justice
scalia
where
they
occur.
justice
scalia
i
would
be
interested
to
hear.
justice
scalia
his
votes
are
excluded.
justice
scalia
he
is
trying
to
get
another
11
percent...
suddenly
instead
of
needing
just
an
11
percent
vote
of
the
entire
corporation
he
needs
50
percent
of
60
percent,
right?
justice
scalia
more
than
11
percent,
he
would
need
30
percent.
justice
scalia
of
the
persons
to
whom
it
is
directed,
to
get
control,
all
he
needs
is
11
percent
of
the
whole
company,
and
you
are
now
converting
that
into,
he
has
to
get
50
percent
of
all
of
the
remaining
shares
in
order
to
get--
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
say
that
again.
justice
scalia
since
nobody
else
is
subject
to
it
anyway
except
indiana
corporations,
how
can
the
opting
out
provision
lean
in
favor
of
indiana
corporations
only?
justice
scalia
but
not
just
an
indiana
corporation.
i
mean,
they
can--
justice
scalia
--any
friendly
corporation.
so,
it
would
be
discrimination
but
not
discrimination
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
commerce
clause.
justice
scalia
it's
not
only
true.
it's
the
only
point
that's
relevant,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
different
point.
justice
scalia
what
if
the
state
changes
its
corporate
law
to
say
that
shares
are
not
transferable
at
all?
would
that
violate
the
commerce
clause?
justice
scalia
but
it
would
be
okay
in
the
future,
it's
just--
justice
scalia
--i
really
don't
see
the
distinction
you
draw
between
present
and
future
as
far
as
the
commerce
clause
is
concerned.
i
can
see
a
lot
of
difference
as
far
as
whether
it's
a
taking
by
the
state
or
something
of
that
sort,
but
why
should
it
make
any
difference
as
far
as
the
commerce
clause
is
concerned?
justice
scalia
you
mean,
if
a
state...
if
new
york
enacts
a
law
that
says
no
florida
grapefruit
can
come
into
new
york,
it
would
be
good
if
florida
grapefruit
had
previously
been
coming
in
or
bad
if
they
had
previously
been
coming
in
but
good
if
there
had
never
been
any
florida
grapefruit
before?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
why.
it
seems
to
me
you
can't
for
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause
impede
future
commerce
any
more
than
you
can
present
commerce,
can
you?
