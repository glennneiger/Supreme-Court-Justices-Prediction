justice
o'connor
mr.
strain,
may
i
inquire
what
you
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think,
at
least
in
part,
it
is
to
try
to
keep
jobs
and
corporate
headquarters
and
so
forth
within
the
state
of
indiana?
justice
o'connor
it
is
not
a
purpose
at
all?
justice
o'connor
we
should
in
making
our
findings
and
decision
here
conclude
that
that
has
no
part
for
consideration
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it
a
purpose
then
to
provide
protection
to
stockholders
of
public
corporations
incorporated
in
indiana?
justice
o'connor
you
think
that
is
the
purpose?
justice
o'connor
is
it
kind
of
a
strange
form
of
stockholder
protection
to
in
fact
strip
the
stockholders
of
their
right
to
transfer
voting
shares?
isn't
that
kind
of
a
peculiar
protection?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
state
could
pass
an
outright
prohibition
of
the
transfer
of
voting
shares
in
takeover
bids?
justice
o'connor
you
think
there
would
be
no
commerce
clause
violation
or
concern,
in
any
event?
justice
o'connor
of
course,
we
may
not
agree
with
you
on
the
williams
act
analysis.
justice
o'connor
do
you
plan
to
address
the
commerce
clause?
justice
o'connor
may
i
ask--
justice
o'connor
--what
the
implications
are
of
the
seventh
circuit's
holding
on
the
internal
affairs
doctrine,
and
does
that
holding
mean
that
the
courts
are
going
to
be
faced
with
commerce
clause
challenges
to
a
whole
range
of
provisions
such
as
cumulative
voting
and
staggered
boards
and
partnership
voting
and
non-voting
shares
and
all
of
that,
because
the
whole
panoply
of
corporation
law
and
these
restrictions
that
we
find
in
state
law
can
be
said
to
affect
the
market
for
corporate
control
someway
and
that
is
sort
of
the
theory
of
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
o'connor
suppose
the
state
just
passed
a
law
that
said
that
acquisition
of
more
than
a
certain
percentage
of
shares
is
going
to
require
the
voting
of
all
the
stockholders,
period.
justice
o'connor
no,
a
statute
that
just
says,
before
there
can
be
an
acquisition
by
an
outsider
of
more
than
"x"
percentage
of
the
shares
we
are
going
to
require
all
the
other
shareholders
in
the
corporation
to
vote.
justice
o'connor
well,
this
has
a
lot
of
other
things.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
what
about
the
question
i
posed?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
in
a
sense
some
of
these
obstacles
actually
can
be
said
to
enhance
the
ability
of
the
shareholder
to
protect
himself
or
herself.
the
fact
that
the
shareholder
is
permitted
to
act
in
a
group
situation
with
the
benefit
of
disclosure
of
all
that's
going
on,
can
actually
enhance
the
stockholder's
opportunity
to
maximize
a
return
on
the
shares.
justice
o'connor
isn't
that
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that's
a
legitimate
thing
for
a
state
to
be
concerned
about,
if
the
corporation
is
incorporated
in
that
state?
justice
o'connor
are
you
saying
the
statute
is
perfectly
all
right,
then,
for
corporations
which
are
organized
after
the
passage
of
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
sachnoff,
your
argument
strikes
me
as
a
little
bit
at
odds
with
this
court's
case
in
exxon
against
maryland
where
the
state
law
was
enacted
and
it
clearly
favored
in-state
retailers
at
the
expense
of
out-of-state
suppliers.
ninety-five
percent
of
the
suppliers
were
from
out
of
state
and
the
court
said
that
didn't
make
any
difference.
justice
o'connor
this
statute
may
not
totally
stop;
it
may
deter?
