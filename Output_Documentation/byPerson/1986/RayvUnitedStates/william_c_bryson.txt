mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
first,
the
sentences
that
were
imposed
were
not
concurrent,
and
therefore
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
is
not
properly
before
the
court
in
this
case,
but
second,
if
the
court
feels
that
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
the
validity
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
should
be
addressed
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
doctrine
should
be
upheld
in
its
traditional
form,
which
is
to
say
that
when
concurrent
sentences
are
present,
that
an
appellate
court
can
in
an
appropriate
case
affirm
the
concurrent
sentence
count
without
having
to
review
the
merits
of
that
count
or
any
challenge
under
that
count.
now,
with
respect--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
you
honor,
we
are
not
asking
for
any
relief,
any
judgment
that
is
greater
than
the
judgment
that
the
other
party
is
seeking.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
asking
that...
in
other
words,
if
we
had
wanted
to
get
the
extra
$50,
let's
say,
that
it
appears
that
one
could...
one
could
argue
that
the
court
of
appeals
overlooked
the
fact
that
there
was
$150
as
opposed
to
$50.
if
we
had
wanted
the
extra
$100,
we
presumably
would
have
had
to
cross-petition,
but
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
the
way
that
it
approached
the
special
assessments,
its
interpretation
of
the
sentence.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
therefore
we
are
not
asking
for
a
greater
judgment.
we
are
simply
saying
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
mistake.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
except
that
we
may
be
foreclosed
by
virtue
of
our
failure
to
cross-petition--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--from
asking
for
the
judgment
that
would
be
as
favorable
as
we
would
be
entitled
to,
but
nonetheless
we
agree,
which
is
all
that
we
can
do
by
virtue
of
not
having
cross-petitioned,
we
agree
that
at
least
so
much
of
that
judgment
as
would
require
the
court
of
appeals'
current
disposition
to
be
reversed,
we
agree
that
it
should
be
reversed
to
that
extent.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
asking
for
the
extra
$50.
we
are
simply
asking
that
petitioners'
position
be
upheld,
albeit
for
a
different
reason.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
are
confessing
error
on
the
basis
of
a
sentence
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
think
the
court
of
appeals
misconstrued.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
we
have
made
a
motion
to
that
effect.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
we
are,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
quite
confident--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
on
that
count,
but
that
remains
to
be
seen.
one
of
the
ironies
again
of
this
case
is
that
it
is
a
peculiar
case
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
applied
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
is
largely
moot,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there
are
only
two
settings,
i
think,
in
which
one
could
arise
in
the
federal
system,
assuming
that
congress
doesn't
repeal
the
statute
any
time
soon.
one
is
if
the
district
court
simply
omits
to
impose
the
assessment
or
omits
to
impose
it
consecutively.
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
statute
requires
that
they
be
consecutive.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
there
may
be
a
few
such
cases.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
would
assume
as
time
goes
on
the
courts--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
other
situation
would
be
in
an
assimilative
crimes
act
case.
there
is
a
case
out
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
mayberry
case,
in
which
the
tenth
circuit
held,
erroneously,
we
think,
but
nonetheless
held
that
the
special
assessments
do
not
apply
to
sentences
imposed
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act
because
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
of
course,
picks
up
the
state
sentences.
we
think
that
the
special
assessment
was
intended
to
apply
to
all
federal
crimes,
including
assimilative
crimes
act--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
correct,
until
the
statute--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--in
the
federal
system
until
and
unless
the
statute
is
overturned,
assuming
we
are
correct
both
on
our
challenge
to
the
assimilative
crimes
act--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--case
and
also
to
our
contention
that
the
special
assessment
applies
consecutively.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
our
first
position,
that
there
simply
weren't
concurrent
sentences,
and
that
therefore
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
is
not
really
presented.
however--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--they
are
mandatory,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
as
the
statute...
it
was
devised
in
order
to
try
to
create
a
fund
for
witness
compensation.
it
is
mandatory
on
every
count.
it
applies
to
both
felonies
and
misdemeanors.
it
is
a
little
hard
to
believe
that
$50
a
throw
could
even
pay
for
the
clerical
expenses
that
would
be
involved
in
collecting
the
money,
but
that
is
what
congress
decided,
and
they
made
it
mandatory
for
the
purpose
of
not
going
into
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
as
a
fine
would,
but
rather
to
create
a
fund
for
witness
protection.
now,
in
our
view
that
means
that
it
has
to
be
imposed
in
every
case.
the
view
we
would
take
if
the
court
determines
to
reach
the
question
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
is
that,
as
i
say,
the
traditional
rule
should
be
preserved
and
that
is
that
if
the
concurrent
count,
the
sentence
on
which
a
concurrent
sentence
has
been
imposed,
foreseeably
will
have
no
significant
adverse
consequences,
then
the
proper
disposition
is
for
the
court,
if
it
believes
that
the
situation
is
appropriate
for
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
to
do
so,
to
affirm
that
count.
there
are
two
other
options,
one
of
which,
of
course,
is
to,
as
in
the
ninth
circuit,
to
review
every
count
regardless
of
the
absence
of
any
adverse
collateral
consequences,
and
the
other
is
the
disposition
that
was
used
in
this
case
and
that
is
used
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
and
that
is
to
vacate
any
count
on
which
a
concurrent
sentence
was
imposed.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
is
extraordinary.
it
was
certainly
inventive.
it
solves...
it
isn't
as
odd,
i
think,
as
it
may
sound
at
first
blush.
it
would
be--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is
our
principal
objection
to
it,
of
course,
in
that
courts
should
be
very
slow
to
be
vacating
presumptively
valid
convictions
on
grounds
of
convenience,
but
on
the
other
hand
what
the
court
in
the
hooper
case,
which
is
the
d.c.
circuit
case
that
began
this...
invented
this
device
really,
what
the
court
said
was
that
this
count
will
essentially
be
put
in
the
deep
freeze,
and
we
will
hold
onto
it,
and
if
it
turns
out
later
that
the
government
needs
the
count
for
some
purpose,
then
we
may
go
back
and
review
it.
so
it
isn't
as
if
it
is
being
vacated
forever.
it
is
not
as
if
it
is
being
thrown
away.
it
is
simply
being
put
in
some
kind
of
suspended
animation.
now,
we
think
that
is
a
very
messy
kind
of
status
which
has
no--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
the
way
you
do
it
is
simply
declare
that
you
have
done
it--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
just
depends
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
calls
it.
if
the
d.c.
circuit,
for
example,
says
that
this
conviction
is
hereby
vacated,
what
it
presumably
means
is
that
that
conviction
cannot
be
used
for
any
purpose
until
we
declare
it
can,
so
that
they
are
simply
saying
the
judgment
of
conviction
is
vacated
and
presumably
also
any
collateral
consequences
that
may
flow
from
the
fact
or
the
verdict
of
conviction
or
the
judgment
of
conviction
are
simply
foreclosed
by
virtue
of
our
order.
it
is
in
effect
an
injunction,
as
i
understand
the
hooper
case,
against
any
district
court
from
over
making
use
of
that
conviction
until
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
it
may.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
under
2106
is
where
the
authority
came,
which
is
essentially
the
statutory
authority
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
dispose
of
the
case
as
it
sees
appropriate.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
in
the
hooper
case
they
talked
in
terms
of
a
suspension
of
the
sentence,
but
i
think
what
they
really
meant
was
a
little
more
than
just
suspension
of
the
sentence,
because
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
they
meant
to
leave
in
effect
the
verdict
of
conviction
for
use
as
a
verdict
of
conviction--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
is.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
is,
and
that
is
why
i
think...
that
is
one
of
the
achilles
heels,
i
think,
that
this
hooper
process
suffers
from,
is
why
we
don't
believe
that
is
the
appropriate--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
but
were
the
court
to
get
to
it
we
would
say
that
for
precisely
the
reason
you
have
said,
that
this
verdict
of
conviction
is
important
and
it
seems
to
be
lingering
there
in
the
air.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
certainly
has
the
effect
of
preventing
any
further
review
because
the
judgment
has
been
vacated.
you
can't
review
just
the
verdict
of
conviction,
but
the
verdict
of
conviction,
as
long
as
it
stands,
may
have
collateral
consequences
even
though
those
collateral
consequences
were
not
intended
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
went
through
the
hooper
procedure,
so
it
is
a
messy
kind
of
procedure
that
creates,
i
think,
more
problems
than
it
solves.
it
is
much
easier,
i
think,
more
straightforward,
and
more
conventional
to
simply
say
if
there
is
no
reasonable
likelihood
of
any
adverse
collateral
consequences
we
should
simply
affirm.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh,
it
is
settled,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
would
say
50
percent
of
their
criminal
cases
in
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuits
are
disposed
of
unpublished
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh,
i
am
sorry,
no.
they
have
followed
that
process
for
the
last
five
or
six
years
i
think,
maybe
four
or
five
years.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
they
have
done
that
in
a
number
of
cases.
they
have
been
somewhat
inconsistent.
sometimes
they
have
followed
the
traditional--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
they
certainly
have
done
this
in
published
opinions.
the
cardona
case
is
the
leading
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
only
case
in
which
i
know
that
has
happened
is
a
case
not
out
of
the
fifth
or
eleventh
circuits,
but
out
of
the
d.c.
circuit,
a
case
called
miller,
which
was
decided...
i
think
it
is
in
449
f
2nd,
in
which
the
government
said
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
applied
the
hooper
doctrine
and
vacated
this
concurrent
count
had
said,
wait,
this
was
a
separate
offense,
it
was
a
serious
offense,
we
think
the
public
interest
requires
that
you
review
this
separate
offense
even
though
there
was
a
concurrent
sentence,
and
the
court
of
appeals
acquiesced
and
did
review
it
and
did
affirm
it.
so
that
is
the
only
case
in
which
i
know
that
has
happened.
typically
in
these
cases,
and
i
think
it
underscores
the
fact
that
in
these
cases
there
are
very
few
instances
in
which
there
are
any
collateral
consequences--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--u.s.
attorneys'
manual?
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
would
like
to
be
as
optimistic
as
the
question
suggests
in
thinking
that
an
amendment
in
the
u.s.
attorneys'
manual
would
immediately
alert
everyone
in
the
field.
i
suppose--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
interestingly,
the
u.s.
attorney
in
this
case--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--didn't
make
that
argument.
this
argument
was
raised
by
the
appellant
in
his
brief
by
way
of
anticipating
a
possible
concurrent
sentencing
argument
by
either
the
government
or
on
the
part
of
the
court
which
wasn't
made.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
didn't
address
the
question
of
concurrent
sentencing.
in
fact,
the
government
said
without
elaboration
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
an
assessment,
a
3013
assessment
on
each
count,
but
not
pointing
out
that
it
was
made
consecutive,
as
it
was,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
because
there
was
no
argument,
this
point
was
never
raised,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
with
the
appellant
that
the
assessment
was
actually
a
finer
assumed
it
to
be
a
$50
fine
and
proceeded
from
there
to
accept--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
no,
this
has
just,
i
think,
because
the
statute
is
fairly
new,
and
because
these
cases
are
just
getting
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
first
times
that
this
point
has
come
up.
it
obviously
was
not
congresses's
intent
to
toss
out
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
with
this
statute,
but
it
just
may
have
been
and
in
fact
we
think
was.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
would
be
if
he
were
right
in
his
analysis
of
his
case.
let's
suppose
that
his
case
involved
just
two
counts,
the
two
substantive
counts,
and
did
not
involve
the
conspiracy
count.
if
that
were
the
case,
his
first
count
on
which
his
conviction
was
affirmed
involved
one
gram
of
cocaine.
the
second
count,
which
the
court
of
appeals
vacated,
involved
the
six
ounces,
the
substantive
count.
that
would
have
made
a
big
difference
in
his
parole
disposition
and
under
the
rubin
case
and
other
authorities
that
would
have
been
enough
to
require
that
the
court
of
appeals
review
that
second
count.
however,
in
this
case
the
conspiracy
count,
as
the
court
of
appeals
analyzed
it
itself,
involved
precisely
the
same
conduct
that
was
at
issue
in
the
substantive
counts,
and
in
fact
mr.
ray
agreed
specifically
in
an
admission
that
was
part
of
the
record
to
obtain
the
cocaine
that
was
on
order,
said
that
he
had
three
ounces
himself
and
would
go
find
some
more.
that
is
plenty
of
evidence
to
support
the
conspiracy
count,
conspiracy
to
possess
with
intent
to
distribute
ten
ounces
of
cocaine
or
at
least
six
ounces
of
cocaine,
and
under
the
parole
guidelines
a
conspiracy
is
rated
the
same
as
the
substantive
offense
even
if
there
is
an
acquittal
on
the
substantive
offense,
so
that
he
is
in
the
same
boat
if
he
is
convicted
on
the
conspiracy
as
if
he
is
convicted
on
the
substantive
offense.
he
is...
if
it
weren't
for
the
conspiracy
count
he
would
be
in
a
different
position.
but
our
position
is
that
he
is
stuck
on
that.
the
one
which
point
he
made
in
his
argument
which
is
correct
is
that
the
parole
board
did
not
acknowledge
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
thrown
out,
vacated,
or
whatever
it
had
done,
the
one
count,
the
count
3,
and
the
parole
board
went
ahead
and
reviewed
this
case
as
if
there
had
been
a
sustained
conviction
on
the
third
count.
now
that,
i
think,
was
a
mistake,
but
our
position
is,
he
would
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
by
virtue
of
the
conspiracy
count,
so
that
mistake
is
immaterial
to
his
position,
and
of
course
in
any
event
our
position
is
that
they
are
not
concurrent
sentences
in
this
case
and
therefore
all
of
that
becomes
immaterial.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
to
add.
thank
you.
