mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
with
this
federal
criminal
case
petitioner
requests
that
the
court
acknowledge
the
demise
of
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
that
has
been
utilized
by
this
court
since
at
least
1891
in
the
clawson
case.
in
our
argument
we
plan
to
discuss
the
relevant
trial
evidence,
the
sentencing
hearing,
and
the
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
question
presented,
look
at
the
government's
special
assessment
contention,
and
then
look
through
the
arguments
we
make
why
the
doctrine
should
be
abolished,
in
particular
calling
this
court's
attention
to
the
ninth
circuit
case
of
united
states
versus
debright
where
that
circuit
has
abolished
it
in
a
well-reasoned
opinion.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
i
was
going
to
try
to
attempt
to
answer
that
while
i
am
working
on
the
special
assessment.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
certainly,
your
honor.
first,
we
need
to
look
at
the
procedural
background.
there's...
defendant's
indicted
on
three-count
indictment,
jury
conviction.
the
first
count
of
the
indictment
deals
with
the
conspiracy.
it
says
that
the
conspiracy
lasted
from
may
25,
1985,
until
june
3
of
1985.
the
defendant
and
pablo
sandoval
and
others
unknown
to
the
grand
jury
unlawfully
possessed
with
intent
to
distribute
a
quantity
of
cocaine,
and
it
is
unspecified
how
much.
count
2
charges
the
substantive
offense
of
possession
of
one
gram
on
may
29.
count
3,
which
is
in
contention
here,
alleged
the
second
substantive
offense
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
of
approximately
six
ounces
of
cocaine
on
the
following
day,
may
30.
at
the
sentencing
hearing
on
may...
excuse
me,
on
october
2,
1985,
the
district
court
committed
petitioner
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
for
seven
years
on
count
1,
seven
years
on
count
2
and
3,
and
a
special
parole
term
of
five
years
on
counts
2
and
3.
those
sentences
are
to
run
concurrent.
these
sentences
were
pursuant
to
18
usc
4205(b)(2),
and
that
provision
of
our
law
allows
parole
at
the
time
the
parole
commission
may
deem
appropriate.
both
parties
in
their
briefs
have
treated
this
as
a
4205(a)
sentence,
which
is
a
little
different.
the
prisoner
has
to
serve
a
third
of
his
time
before
he
ever
becomes
eligible.
we
don't
have
this
in
this
case
officially
from
the
district
court,
but
the
parole
board
at
their
option,
they
have
treated
this
as
a
sentence
requiring
the
man
to
at
least
serve
a
third.
the
actual
trial
evidence,
we
don't
contest
that
were
was
a
conspiracy.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
there
as
a
$50
special
assessment,
your
honor,
i
am
sorry,
on
each
of
the
three
counts,
for
a
total
of
$150,
and
that
is
pursuant
to
what
we
are
going
to
reach
in
a
minute,
18
usc
3013,
the
new
special
assessment
act.
we
don't
contest
the
evidence
on
the
conspiracy
in
the
sense
that
the
conspiracy
existed
on
may
29
for
sure.
the
government
wanted
to
get
into
detail
that
the
conspiracy
continued
through
may
30th
and
i
am...
petitioner
is
not
sure
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
for
that,
and
that
is
what
count
3
gets...
it
becomes
very
important
about
count
3.
count
3
is
the
crime
of
six
ounces
on
may
30th,
and
i
don't
think
there
was
enough
evidence
to
convict
my
client
of
that
crime.
i
took
that
issue
to
the
fifth
circuit.
they
refused
to
review
that
issue,
invoking
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine,
and
vacated
the
man's
conviction
on
the
third
count.
that
count
has
had
some
collateral
consequences
at
the
parole
commission,
and
we
are
going
to
get
to
deal
into
that
in
just
a
minute,
but
back
to
the
evidentiary
facts.
there
is
a
drug
deal.
informer
is
working
with
dea
agent
herber.
mr.
sandoval
wants
to
sell
cocaine
to
somebody.
he
approaches
the
informer
and
says,
do
you
know
anybody
i
can
sell
cocaine
to,
and
molina
sets
him
up
with
ms.
herber,
the
agent.
he
sells
her
the
sample
to
show
that
he
has
got
good
quality
stuff.
it
tested
out
to
be
92
percent.
that
involves
count
2.
he
did
that
delivery
on
may
29.
my
client
from
the
evidence
is
involved
in
that.
he
is
the
supplier
of
that
gram
of
cocaine.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
i
recognize
that,
your
honor,
but
it
becomes
important
because
one
of
the
contentions
made
by
the
government
is
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
find
my
client
guilty
of
the
six-ounce...
or
let
me
word
it
this
way,
that
the
six-ounce
delivery
is
involved
in
the
conspiracy
of
count
1.
he
has
been
convicted
of
the
count
1
conspiracy.
that
has
been
affirmed.
and
therefore
the
parole
commission
can
use
conspiracy
in
count
1
against
my
client
and
leave
him
in
this
extra
time,
so
the
government
in
reaching
the
merits
of
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
says
count
3
has
no
effect
on
my
client.
when
i
get
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
i
am
going
to
lose
on
count...
no,
when
i
get
to
the
parole
commission
i
am
going
to
lose
on
the
sufficiency
issue
because
they
are
going
to
use
it
against
my
client
anyway,
so
that
is
why,
if
you
follow
me,
that
is
why
the
sufficiency
on
count
3
becomes
important.
we
counter
that...
let
me
follow
up
on
that
right
now.
we
counter
that
with
the
parole
commission's
own
rules
that
say
if
a
count
conviction
is...
a
man
is
acquitted
on
a
conviction
after
trial,
then
the
parole
commission
won't
use
that
under
normal
circumstances,
so
if
i
can
get
a
not
guilty
on
count
3
down
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
parole
commission
is
not
supposed
to
use
that,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
let
me
turn
to
that
right
now,
judge.
the
government
in
their
motion
and
on
the
merits
brief,
they
do
concede
that
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment
should
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
back
to
permit
that
court
to...
for
me
to
challenge
the
unreviewed
count
down
there.
they
reason
that
because
the
legislatures
enacted
the
special
assessment
law--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--that
that
law
became
effective
november
12,
1984,
so
under
their
theory
that
would
have...
no
appellate
court
should
invoke
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--right,
your
honor,
and
i
agree
with
you,
but
i
was
so
scared
when--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--when
they
filed
their
motion,
though,
i
was
so
scared
the
court
might
give
us
about
a
two-sentence
motion
and
nobody
in
the
country
would
know
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
is
gone,
and
they
would
continue
using
it
for
some
time
until
you
all
could
actually--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--in
the
federal
system.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
i
guess
a
two-sentence
one.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
your
honor,
there
has
been
a
bunch
of
debate
and
at
least
three
appellate
decisions
so
far.
three
of
them
have
held
that
it
does
apply
to
each
of
the
three
counts.
in
my
case
it
would
total
$150.
the
litigants
in
those
cases
were
litigating
and
saying,
no,
it
only
applied
per
defendant
per
indictment,
regardless
of
how
many
counts
he
was
convicted
on.
you
can
only
get
a
total
of
$50
per
indictment.
and
three
circuit
courts
have
said
that
is
wrong
so
far.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
yes,
sir.
it
seems
to
be
a
pretty
reasonable...
if
you
look
at...
the
best
one
i
saw
was
the
donaldson
case
from
the
third
circuit.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
i
think,
your
honor,
we
do
agree
with
the
government's
position,
but
we
would
like
our
knowledge
and
that
of
the
members
of
this
court
shared
with
the
appellate
judiciary
throughout...
the
federal
judiciary
throughout
the
country,
so
it
will
stop
illegally
using--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--i
understand
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
right,
your
honor,
so
we
can
get
back
to
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
i
don't
know.
it
sure
missed
me
in
the
fifth
circuit
when
we
were
down
there
arguing
in
the
fifth
circuit,
your
honor,
even
though
there
were
special
assessments
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
yes,
that
is
what
i
am
saying,
and
i
believe
they...
if
i
remember
their
opinion
in
this
case,
they
called
that
$150,
they
call
it
a
fine
in
the
actual
opinion
from
the
fifth
circuit.
they
don't
call
it
a
special
assessment.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
he
missed
it
in
the
original,
when
i
was
asking
for
petition
for
cert,
your
honor.
yes,
he
did.
but
at
that
time
i
don't
believe
he
had
a
copy
of
the
trial
court's
judgment
before
him.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
that
is
the
decision
in
the
pinkus
case.
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
in
the
fifth
circuit.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
no,
it
is
not--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--it
hasn't
been
paid
and
it--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
by
their
motion
to
vacate,
i
got
the
impression
they
would
like
me
to
get
out
of
here.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
they
have
confessed
error--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--they
have
confessed
error
in
the
past,
and
the
last
two
times
this
issue
was
before
the
court
they
confessed
error
each
time
and
it
disappears
off
the
docket.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine,
yes,
sir,
in
rubin
and
mariscal,
and
so
the
court--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--i
never
appealed
on
that,
no.
i
am
appealing
on
the
sufficiency
issue--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--right.
from
our
viewpoint,
the
solicitor
general
wanted
to
narrow
this
case
down
to
the
special
assessment
law,
and
we
would
prefer
that
we
talk
about
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
and
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
applied
to
this
client.
if
the
court
recalls
the
opinion
by
justice
white
in
benton
versus
maryland,
he
mentions
that
there
may
come
a
case
where
a
defendant
is
denied
equal
protection
because
most
defendants
can
appeal
their
cases
and
see
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
or
whatever,
and
when
an
appellate
court
refuses
to
address
that
under
the
the
doctrine,
defendant
may
be
denied
equal
protection
if
he
is
hurt,
and
our
man...
my
client
is
definitely
hurt
because
the
parole
commission
is
using
this
against
him.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
ask
me
that
again,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
let
me
try
to
answer
it
this
way.
in
the
sense
that
our
client...
the
reason
for
seeking
review
is
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
he
is
not
guilty
of
this
case,
and
that
seems
to
go
to
the
heart
of
our
system,
and
i
thought
you
could
get
review
on
that,
and
if
an
appellate
court
finds
the
man
not
guilty,
burks
versus
united
states,
1978,
talks
how
he
can't
be
retried.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
to
address
your
question,
that
gets
us
to
the
parole
commission's
guidelines
of
what
they
have
already
said
they
are
going
to
do
in
this
client's
case.
the
guidelines,
if
count
3
was
struck
on
a
sufficiency
ground,
petitioner
feels
that
the
guidelines
would
be
maximum
of
16
months,
but
instead
the
parole
commission
has
told
us
it
is
going
to
be
a
maximum
of
60
months.
that
is
a
whole
lot
of
extra
months
between
there,
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
irrational
when
you
are
attacking
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
they
are
using
that
against
us.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
the
court
doesn't
note...
have
this
document
before
it.
i
would
like
to
leave
a
copy
with
the
clerk.
but
it
is
the
notice--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--yes,
and
they
have
noted
it
in
their
brief
on
the
merits
at
footnote
25.
they
have
used
this
to
explain
to
you.
my
client
after
we...
the
vacation
in
the
fifth
circuit
he
filed
his
notice
of
appeal
to
the
parole
commission,
and
he--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--the
conviction,
but
not
the
jury's
verdict.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
by
writing
an
opinion
and
signing
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
i
don't
understand
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
and
it
can
be
reimposed
whenever
the
government
wants,
and
at
that
time
we
can
seek
review
in
the
future.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
and
order
an
acquittal
on
that
count.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
obviously
it
voids--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--i
thought
it
voided
the
jury's
verdict.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
you
would,
but
this
fine
distinction
that
three
of
the
circuits
are
using
that
it
is
okay
to
vacate
convictions
but
not
the
jury's
verdict--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--their
guidelines
seem
to
say
even
if
it
is
vacated
they
can
still
use
the...
in
fact,
that
is
what
they
say
in
this
case.
they
can
still
use
the
conviction
against
my
client
even
though
it
is
vacated
because--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
support
that
conviction
anyway,
and
they
get
back
into
sufficiency.
procedurally
i
think
it
was
june
when
we
received
the
fifth
circuit
opinion.
in
august
my
client
filed
his...
pro
so
filed
his
appeal
with
the
parole
folks,
and
they
ruled
on
it
later
on.
at
page
53
of
the
merits--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--yes,
sir.
yes
sir,
and
this
is
his
application
that
the
government
speaks
of
in
their
footnote
25
at
the
end
of
the
merits
brief.
the
actual
parole
commission
ruling
on
that
appeal
is
found
in
our
brief
at
page
63,
and
we
show
you
that
they
are
actually
using
this
vacated
conviction
against
him
and
therefore
that
is
the
collateral
consequence
that
it
seems
to
me
the
fifth
circuit
missed
and
at
least
in
the
sufficiency
area
because
of
the
way
the
parole
commission
uses
these
things,
there
should
be
a
rule
that
says
from
this
court
that
under
these
circumstances
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
at
least
is
abolished
in
the--
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
--your
honors,
that
is
exactly
what
the
first
opinion
in
the
ninth
circuit's
case
of
debright
said.
i
think
it
is
at
710
fed
2nd.
that
was
a
panel.
and
we
will
just
vacate
it.
then
it
went
en
banc
and
the
entire
court
with
no
dissents
held
that
that
is
an
improper
way
to
handle
these
things,
the
mere
vacation,
that
is
an
improper
way
to
handle
it,
and
then
they
proceeded
to
address,
i
believe,
six
or
seven
reasons
why
they
needed
to
abolish
the
doctrine
under
their
supervisory
power
because
it
was
just
improper
to
invoke
it
at
all.
we
have
set
that
out
in
our
brief
quite
in
detail.
0....
are
there
any
other
questions
from
the
court?
i
believe
i
have
covered
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
just
want
to
address
two
things.
justice
stevens,
you
asked
about
other
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit.
i
have
got
a
couple
of
them
on
my
brief
on
page
89
and
90.
montemayor
was
a
big
drug
case.
i
think
the
man
got
about
50
years.
and
cardona
was
the
first
time
the
fifth
circuit
used
the
vacation
of
convictions.
in
the
fifth
circuit's
own
opinion
they
cite
another
one
or
two
cases.
abi
is
the
name
of
one
defendant,
but
they
have
been
doing
it
since
at
least
1981,
and
now
the
eleventh
circuit
has
picked
it
up
from
its
sister
circuit.
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
address
is
the
last
point
that
counsel
was
making.
at
the
parole
commission
mr.
ray
will
be
responsible
for
the
six-ounce
delivery
because
that
is
part
of
the
conspiracy,
and
therefore
when
it
is
all
over
the
parole
commission
has
done
the
right
thing.
that
is
the
contention
of
the
government.
i
think
that
is
wrong,
and
let
me
call
the
court's
attention
to...
one
cfr
we
didn't
bring
to
you,
but
it
is
28
cfr
2.20,
which
is
the
normal
one
on
parole,
and
then
under
chapter
13
there
is
one
called
number
4,
and
it
talks
about
the
vicarious
liability.
and
it
reminds
one
of
the
pinkerton
case
that
this
court
decided
in
1946
about
vicarious
liability,
and
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
second.
but
that
particular
cfr
reads,
"the
prisoner
is
held
accountable
for
his
own
actions
and
actions
done
in
concert
with
others.
"
"however,
the
prisoner
is
not
to
be
held
accountable
for
activities
committed
by
associates
over
which
the
prisoner
has
no
control
and
could
not
have
been
reasonably
expected
to
foresee.
"
so
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
that
mr.
ray
is
responsible...
from
which
that
inference
or
speculation
could
be
drawn
is
set
out
on
my
brief
at
page
20,
and
may
i
read
that
to
you,
because
i
don't
think
it
is
enough
to
get
there
even
at
the
parole
commission,
and
so
mr.
ray...
that
is
where
we
differ
with
the
government.
mr.
ray
will
not
be
held
accountable
because
he
could
not
reasonably
expect
to
foresee
that
sandoval
would
find
six
ounces
and
make
the
delivery
the
following
day,
it
being
our
contention
ray
is
not
the
supplier
of
those
six
ounces.
the
quote
from
the
record,
and
this
is
mr.
molina
talking...
he
is
the
informer.
he
is
on
the
stand,
and
he's
telling
the
jury
the
following.
sandoval
advised
ray
about
this
person
that
was
willing
to
buy
ten
ounces
of
cocaine,
and
then
quote,
"and
that
this
person
was
requesting
ten
ounces,
and
they
weren't
sure
if
they
could
come
up
with
the
ten
ounces
but
they
had
three
ounces
is
what
i
heard
john
say.
"
my
client,
"and
that
they
would
have
to
go
back
and
see
if
they
could
get
the
rest.
"
and
that
is
the
extent
of
mr.
ray's
involvement.
i
got
three
ounces,
i'll
see
if
i
can
get
any
more.
now,
we
don't
know
whether
we
got
any
more.
we
don't
know
if
sandoval
got
the
rest...
got
all
six
ounces
from
a
third
supplier
or
he
got
half
from
mr.
ray,
half
from
somebody
else,
and
yet
the
government...
that
little
statement
there
is
enough
for
the
government
to
say
my
client
is
involved
in
a
six-ounce
conspiracy
when
the
actual
conspiracy
pled
in
this
case
is...
it
doesn't
say
how
many
ounces.
it
just
says
a
quantity
of
cocaine.
and
so
they
want
that
to
cover
both
counts
1
and
2.
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
pardon
me?
mr.
joseph
a.
connors,
iii
yes,
sir,
six
ounces
were
delivered,
and
based
on
the
snitch's
overheard
conversation,
petitioner
said
that
he
had
three
and
that
they
would
have
to
go
back
and
see
if
they
could
get
the
rest.
so
we
feel
once
the
parole
commission
has
this
before
it
at
least
it
is
a
good
issue
of
which
side
of
us,
the
government
or
mr.
ray,
will
be
responsible
for
sandoval's
act
of
delivering
it
the
following
day,
since
there
is
no
evidence
that
ray
actually
handed
over
the
six
ounces.
so
i
would
ask
you
to
reach
the
doctrine
that
we
brought
to
you.
thank
you.
