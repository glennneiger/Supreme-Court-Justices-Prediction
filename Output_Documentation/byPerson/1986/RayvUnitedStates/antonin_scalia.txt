justice
scalia
mr.
connors,
i
hate
to
be
a
skunk
at
a
garden
party,
but
you
really...
you
really
haven't
been
harmed
by
anything
that
has
to
do
with
this
assessment,
right?
the
assessment
was
set
aside
by
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
it?
justice
scalia
yes,
so
that
is
no
part
of
your
appeal
at
all,
is
it?
justice
scalia
you
haven't
been
harmed
by
it.
justice
scalia
right,
it
hasn't
been
paid
or
anything.
and
the
government
hasn't
cross-petitioned,
has
it?
justice
scalia
so
do
you
want
to
tell
us
how
that
is
up
before
us
then?
justice
scalia
they
can't
move
to
vacate
if
they
didn't
seek
an
appeal.
justice
scalia
they
can
do
that,
just
come
up
and
move
to
vacate?
justice
scalia
confessing...
yes,
but
they
have
confessed
error
on
an
issue
that
had
been
a
subject
of
the
appeal.
justice
scalia
but
this
$50
fine
is
not
the
subject
of
an
appeal.
your
client
hasn't
been
harmed
by
it.
justice
scalia
you
couldn't
appeal
on
it,
because
you
didn't
pay
it.
justice
scalia
mr.
bryson,
can
we
assume
that
it
is
true
that
these
fines
are
routinely
sought?
i
mean,
is
there
an
element
of...
supposing
the
united
states
attorneys
say,
you
know,
for
$50
it
is
not
worth
it
to
have
to
go
up
on
appeal
and
sustain
all
counts.
justice
scalia
they
are
mandatory.
justice
scalia
they
do
this
presumably
pursuant
to
their
supervisory
powers
over
the
district
court.
is
that
it?
