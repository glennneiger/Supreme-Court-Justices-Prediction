chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
86-281,
john
william
ray
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
connors,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
connors,
i
would
think
that
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
your
view
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
that
is,
that
the
fifth
circuit
should
have
considered
your
claim
on
that
count
here,
we
would
not
decide
it
ourselves,
but
would
probably
send
it
back
to
the
fifth
circuit.
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
we
would
get
into
the
merits
of
whether
the
evidence
supported
the
verdict
on
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
irrational
about
the
distinction
between
concurrent
sentences
and
nonconcurrent
sentences,
if
you
are
going
to
talk
in
constitutional
terms?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
are
saying
there
is
a
violation
of
equal
protection
if
your
client
can't
appeal
and
somebody
else
can
appeal
and
get
review.
what
is
irrational
about...
for
equal
protection
purposes
about
distinguishing
between
concurrent
sentences
and
nonconcurrent
sentences
so
far
as
deciding
which
sentences
to
review?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
to
make
out
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
you
have
to
show
not
just
that
your
client
is
in
a
class
treated
differently
from
another
class
but
that
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
irrational.
now,
as
i
understand
the
distinction
here
is
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
says
if
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
punishment
you
are
going
to
get
an
appellate
court
doesn't
have
to
review
a
particular
count,
and
that
doesn't
seem
irrational
to
me.
it
may
be
a
violation
of
the
statute,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
have
got
a
much
stronger
argument
on
violation
of
the
statute
than
you
do
on
the
constitution.
chief
justice
rehnquist
his
appeal
from
where
to
the
parole
folks?
i
mean,
he
had
an
application
to
the
parole
commission?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
connors.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
from
you
now,
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
if
we
accept
your
confession
of
error
here
we
are
electing
not
to
address
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
are
saying
this
was
a
case
in
which
there
weren't
concurrent
sentences.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
latter
seems
to
me
the
most
extraordinary
of
all--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
think
it
is
odd
because
a
court
is
undertaking
to
vacate
a
sentence
without
any
finding
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
it,
and
not
on
the
request
of
the
government.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
speak
of
concurrent
sentences,
mr.
bryson,
and
anticipating
collateral
consequences.
what
about
the
consequences
that
mr.
connors
says
he
must
anticipate
for
his
client
here,
the
parole
commission
guidelines?
is
that
sufficient
to
avoid
the
application
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
connors,
you
have
eleven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
connors.
the
case
is
submitted.
