justice
stevens
may
i
ask
before
you
get
too
deeply
into
your
argument
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
government's
motion
that
the
issue
really
isn't
here
because
these
sentences
were
not
the
same?
justice
stevens
all
right.
it
is
rather
important
to
me,
because
i--
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
before
you
finish
the
sentencing,
have
you
described
completely
the
sentences
that
were
imposed?
i
thought
there
was
a
$50--
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
you
don't
mind
if
we
grant
the
government's
motion.
you
just
want
us
to
explain
why
we
have
granted
it.
you
want
a
paragraph
instead
of
"the
motion
is
granted".
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
a
minute?
is
there
anything
regarding
the
disposition
of
the
case
with
respect
to
which
you
disagree
with
the
government?
is
there
anything
we
have
to
decide?
assume
we
take
everything
you
two
agree
upon.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
that
is
really
our
responsibility
and
not
yours,
though?
i
suppose
that
is
our
job,
not
yours.
justice
stevens
your
job
is
to
get
your
client
the
relief
you
think
he
is
entitled
to.
justice
stevens
don't
you
have
to
cross-petition
to
ask
for
that
relief?
justice
stevens
but
you
are
saying
if
we
reach
the
issue
we
should
modify
the
judgment
below.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
no,
i
think
you
are
asking
for
a
greater
judgment
if
you
assume
that
three
concurrent
sentences
are
more
severe
because
of
their
collateral
consequences
than
just
two.
you
are
saying
the
proper
and
normal
disposition
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
have
been
to
vacate
the
sentence
on
count
3
but
rather
to
affirm
on
count
3.
so
if
we
followed
what
you
say
is
a
correct
rule
of
law,
the
result
will
be,
we
would
order
the
court
of
appeals
to
enter
a
different
judgment.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
of
course,
the
irony
of
this
case
as
i
see
it
is
that
the
net
result
of
your
joint
position
may
well
be
that
when
this...
when
there
is
review
on
the
third
count
they
may
find
there
is
sufficient
evidence,
and--
justice
stevens
--you
don't
complain
about
that,
but--
justice
stevens
mr.
bryson,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
this
case?
this
opinion,
also
that
remarkable
footnote
at
the
beginning
that
the
local
rule
provides
for
nonpublication
of
certain...
and
they
didn't
publish
this
one,
did
they?
justice
stevens
was
this
the
first
time
they
laid
down
this
remarkable
doctrine?
is
this
settled
doctrine
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
stevens
they
do
this
all
the
time.
they
vacate--
justice
stevens
--no,
i
don't
mean
the
unpublished
opinion.
i
know
they
do
that
a
lot.
but
the
rule
of
law
regarding
the
concurrent
sentences
that
when
they
are
the
same
will
vacate
one
and
hold
it
in
suspension.
justice
stevens
they
have.
i
see.
justice
stevens
that
is
a
good
reason
not
to
publish
the
opinion,
i
suppose,
if
you
want
to
be
inconsistent.
justice
stevens
have
they
ever,
to
your
knowledge,
actually
exercised
their
power
to
take
a
second
look
where
they
say
we...
you
know,
the
suspended
animation
business,
that
the
government
has
ever
come
back
and
said,
please
go
ahead
and
review
it?
