justice
white
weren't
you
going
to
deal
with
this
special
assessment
as
to
whether--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
in
the
federal
system
that
means
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
is
done
away
with
in
any
case,
and
i
don't...
you
really
don't
care
on
what
ground
you
win
your
case
on,
do
you?
if
you
are
representing
your
client,
if
you
want
to
get
that
count,
the
evidence
on
that
count
reviewed,
the
government's
position
is
that
you
should
have
it.
justice
white
you
don't
need
to
argue
on
behalf
of
any
other
clients.
justice
white
you
mean
it
is
gone
in
the
federal
system.
justice
white
well,
i
would
think
the
three
courts
of
appeals
who
have
construed
this
act
must
know
that
the
concurrent
sentence...
that
these
counts...
that
these
sentences
aren't
concurrent.
do
you
think
there
is
any
real
problem?
justice
white
i
guess
the
fifth
circuit
missed
it,
too.
justice
white
well,
the
same
result
would
be
with
a
fine,
if
you
imposed
a
fine
on
each
count.
justice
white
xxx
sentence
on
this
count
was
set
aside?
justice
white
does
the
government
have
that?
justice
white
by
the
way,
what
was
vacated
by
the
fifth
circuit?
the
conviction
was?
justice
white
how
do
you
do
that?
justice
white
well,
i
know
that.
justice
white
i
know,
but
it
says
the
conviction
is
vacated.
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
just
thought
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
and
they
just
reversed
the
conviction?
what
would
that
do?
it
would
reverse
the
conviction.
justice
white
and
what
would
it
do
with
the
jury's
verdict?
justice
white
it
just
leaves
it
there.
justice
white
well,
if
you
set
aside
a
conviction,
you
would
think
you
were
having
something
to
do
with
the
jury's
verdict,
wouldn't
you?
justice
white
and
the
parole
commission
seems
to
think
that.
is
that
it?
justice
white
because
why?
justice
white
one
way
to
cure
that
would
be
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
business
vacating
a
conviction
without
reviewing
the
evidence.
you
either
review
the
evidence
or
not.
justice
white
you
are
just
confessing
error.
justice
white
and
you
made
a
motion.
justice
white
you
made
a
motion
earlier--
justice
white
--a
couple
of
months
ago--
justice
white
--asking
us
to
vacate
and
remand.
justice
white
--in
light
of
the
special
assessment
statute,
isn't
any
argument
about
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
sort
of
moot?
justice
white
because
there
never
will
be
a
concurrent
sentence.
justice
white
well,
that
would
be
an
erroneous--
justice
white
--an
erroneous...
that
would
be
a--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
what
is
the
other
one?
justice
white
so
if
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
the
special
assessment
statute
is
accepted
and
it
is
followed,
there
never
will
be
another
concurrent
sentence.
justice
white
in
the
federal
system.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
xxx
conviction
and
still
leave
something--
justice
white
--what
is
in
limbo?
what
is
in
limbo?
justice
white
i
suppose...
what
do
you
call
your
handbook
now
for
u.s.
attorneys?
justice
white
i
suppose
there
ought
to
be
some...
are
you
going
to
amend
it
to
talk
about
the
assessment
so
that
this
mistake
isn't
made
again?
justice
white
yes,
but
u.s.
attorneys
shouldn't
any
longer
claim
that
sentences
are
concurrent
in
the
federal
circuits.
justice
white
didn't.
justice
white
what
was
the
government's
answer
to
that?
justice
white
have
there
been
any
other
instances
around
the
country
where
a
court
of
appeals
has
recognized
that
there
can
be
no
concurrent
sentence?
