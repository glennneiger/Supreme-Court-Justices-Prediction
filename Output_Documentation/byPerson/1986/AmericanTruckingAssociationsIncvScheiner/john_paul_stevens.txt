but,
mr.
shapiro,
insofar
as
you
attack
the
marker
tax
or
marker
fee,
you
attack
the
$25
fee,
but
i
don't
think
you
attack
the
$5
fee,
do
you?
justice
stevens
before
you
do
that,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument
about
the
difficulty
of
using
an
audit
or
whatever
it
is,
but
is
it
not
correct
that
43
states
do
have
this
kind
of
mileage
tax
and
only
seven
have
the
flat
tax?
justice
stevens
even
if
they
have
others
as
well,
apparently
they
are
able
to
administer
a
mileage
tax.
justice
stevens
the
chief
justice
asked
you
about
weight.
do
truckers
have
to
stop
at
weighing-stations
as
they
enter
and
leave
the
state?
justice
stevens
--i
have
often
wondered
about
those
weigh
stations.
do
they
just
weigh
and
if
they
are
not
too
heavy
they
let
them
go
on,
or
do
they
keep
any
kind
of
record
of
what
the
weights
were
on
the
trucks?
justice
stevens
they
do
keep
a
record
of
every
truck
that
is
weighed?
justice
stevens
but
was
the
formula
by
which
they
reverted
to
the
1980
level
the
same,
just
the
same
as
the
increase
had
been?
justice
stevens
but
the
form
of
the
statute
was
not
just
a
simple
reduction
to
the
pre-level.
it
had
this
complicated
formula
with
multiples
of
36
in
it,
and
so
forth.
justice
stevens
it
is
just
a
coincidence
that
it
offsets
against
the
axle
tax?
justice
stevens
just
a
coincidence.
justice
stevens
i
guess
justice
nix
wasn't
really
persuaded
by
that,
was
he?
justice
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
your
other
examples
of
weight
and
so
forth,
you
say
none
of
them
are
perfect,
mileage
isn't
perfect
and
so
forth,
but
none
of
these
other
variables
such
as
mileage
would
suggest
that
there
is
any
distinction
drawn
between
local
truckers
and
interstate
truckers,
whereas
the
system
you
have
used
has
the
unique
feature,
as
i
understand
it,
according
to
the
evidence,
at
least,
of
placing
a
heavier
burden
on
the
interstate
trucker
than
it
does
on
the
trucker
who
primarily
drives
in
pennsylvania,
which
would
not
be
true
of
mileage
tax,
weight
tax,
or
any
of
these
other
things.
justice
stevens
well,
but
the
flat
tax
doesn't.
justice
stevens
the
axle
tax
doesn't.
justice
stevens
well,
yes,
but
all
trucks
with
five
axles
pay
the
same
tax
even
if
they
do
all
their
business
in
interstate
commerce,
and
it
does...
is
it
not
correct
that
the
burden
of
the
tax
falls
more
heavily
on
interstate
truckers
than
it
does
on
local
truckers?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
under
your
theory
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference.
i
mean,
even
if
we
assume
that
what
they
say
the
facts
are
are
true,
you
would
say,
well,
that
doesn't
matter.
