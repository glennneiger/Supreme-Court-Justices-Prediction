justice
white
that
is
different.
whom
are
they
competing
with?
justice
white
so
you
are
really
talking
about
people
from
out-of-state
who
are
making
deliveries
in
pennsylvania?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
about
a
class
of
trucks,
that
all
they
do
on
pennsylvania
highways
is
go
through
the
state?
they
make
no
local
deliveries.
is
that...
is
there
discrimination
against
them?
justice
white
what
local
business?
that
isn't
what
i
said.
what
about...
the
only
use
of
pennsylvania
highways
that
these
trucks
make
is,
they
go
through
the
state,
from
one
end
to
the
other
or
from
one
side
to
the
other.
they
don't
stop
in
pennsylvania
except
to
buy
gas.
justice
white
well,
they
aren't
being
discriminated
against,
in
short.
justice
white
well,
that
is...
do
you
think
that
is
a
commerce
clause
question?
justice
white
well,
there
is
no
discrimination.
justice
white
i
don't
understand
that.
if
somebody
wants
to
deliver
some
goods
from
iowa
to
new
york
city
and
goes
through
pennsylvania?
justice
white
truckers
would
rather
pay
this
axle
tax
than
do
that,
i
think.
justice
white
questions
like
that
are
kind
of
out
of
our
reach,
aren't
they?
justice
white
mr.
shapiro,
on
that
argument
you
really
can't
argue
that
easy
single
interstate
trucker
is
being
discriminated
against
in
favor
of
every
single
intrastate
trucker?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so.
justice
white
but
your
argument
is
that
just
because
the
axle
tax
isn't
mileage-related
that
it
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
white
and
that
everybody,
even
though
there
are
a
lot
of
interstate
truckers
who
won't
be
discriminated
against
as
respects...
as
compared
with
some
intrastate
truckers,
just
aren't
discriminated
against.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
of
course,
on
the
structural
argument
everybody,
every
interstate
trucker
is
being
discriminated
against.
justice
white
me.
