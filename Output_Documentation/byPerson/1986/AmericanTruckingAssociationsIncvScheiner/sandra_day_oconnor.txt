justice
o'connor
mr.
shaprio,
congress
is
taking
a
look
at
this
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
it
just
seems
to
me
that
this
court
in
rather
a
long
line
of
cases
has
basically
approved
this
flat
tax
method--
justice
o'connor
--and
there
may
be
quite
a
reliance
interest
now
of
the
states
on
that
system,
and
maybe
it
isn't
the
best,
but
do
you
think
we
have
to
recognize
the
precedents?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
the
case
of
massachusetts
against
the
united
states,
i
think,
cited
those
precedents
again
with
approval
even
after
complete
auto.
justice
o'connor
isn't
there
quite
an
administrative
burden
for
the
states
to
try
to
collect
a
tax
on
some
basis
that
actually
reflects
the
weight
of
the
vehicle
and
the
miles
traveled?
that
is
kind
of
hard
to
do,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
what
are
you
talking
about,
gasoline,
fuel
taxes?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
shapiro,
i
assume
that
some
states
have
collected
millions
of
dollars
of
flat
tax
fees.
if
you
are
right,
are
they
supposed
to
refund
all
that
money?
justice
o'connor
i
would
assume
there
is
a
pretty
heavy
reliance
interest
by
states
on
this
aero
mayflower
line.
justice
o'connor
--are
there
more
than
seven
states
using
the
flat
tax--
justice
o'connor
--system
on
highways?
justice
o'connor
ms.
wolfe,
would
you
concede
that
if
every
state
in
the
united
states
imposed
a
substantial
flat
fee
tax
for
highway
use,
that
the
cumulative
burden
of
those
taxes
could
have...
could
pose
a
threat
to
the
free
flow
of
interstate
commerce
by
trucks?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
the
potential
for
a
severe
burden
is
there,
viewed
cumulatively,
and
i
am
surprised
that
you
can't
recognize
that.
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
it
should
bear
any
relation
at
all
to
the
extent
of
the
use
of
the
highways--
justice
o'connor
--by
the
interstate
user?
justice
o'connor
wouldnt'
that
ultimately
be
the
most
fair
way
to
do
it?
would
you
concede
that?
justice
o'connor
that
a
highway
use
tax
should
bear
some
reasonable
relation
to
the
miles
traveled
and
perhaps
the
weight
and
configuration
of
the
vehicle.
justice
o'connor
you
say
it
is
not
possible
to
achieve
taxes?
