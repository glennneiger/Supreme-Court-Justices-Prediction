mr.
shapiro,
how
do
you
know
that
per
mile
is
the
proper
apportionment?
i
mean,
maybe
it
should
be
per
ton
of
traffic
or
per
ton
mile
or...
there
are
lot
of
different...
per
hours
on
the
roads
of
pennsylvania.
there
are
a
lot
of
different--
justice
scalia
--apportionments
you
could
come
to,
aren't
there?
justice
scalia
there
is
no
single
one.
it
could
be
hours
on
the
road.
justice
scalia
is
that
any
different
from
the
discrimination
that
exists
with
respect
to
the
citizens
of
pennsylvania
themselves?
i
presume
that
every
pennsylvania
citizen
who
purchases
a
car
and
registers
it
in
the
state
pays
a
flat
registration
fee
which
isn't
dependent
on
how
much
he
uses
the
car.
it
is
the
same
type
of
discrimination
there,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
but
you
call
that
discrimination
anyway.
justice
scalia
one
wouldn't
normally
apply
the
term
discrimination
to
that,
would
one?
justice
scalia
again,
the
same
thing
happens
with
regard
to
intrastate
residents,
and
we
don't...
nobody
considers
that
so
discriminatory
that
it
isn't
the
standard
system
in
all
the
50
states
as
far
as
i
know.
justice
scalia
i
understand,
but
the
argument
you
are
making
is
not
just
that
discrimination,
which
has
an
invidious
overtone,
against
commerce
is
bad,
but
you
are
saying
any
absence
of
equality
on
the
part
of
interstate
commerce
is
bad.
justice
scalia
what
is
the
competitive
disadvantage
to
your
interstate
truckers?
justice
scalia
of
course,
i
suspect
the
most
important
of
those
factors
you
mention
is
that
pennsylvania
has
a
lot
of
truck
traffic.
justice
scalia
most
of
which
is
interstate
and
easily
taxable.
wasn't
the
pennsylvania
throughway
the
first
throughway
that
was
built
in
the
country?
justice
scalia
the
first
turnpike.
justice
scalia
feels
like
it,
anyway.
