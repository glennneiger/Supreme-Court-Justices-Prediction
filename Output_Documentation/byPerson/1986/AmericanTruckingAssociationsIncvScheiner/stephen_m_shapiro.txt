mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
appeal
brings
before
the
court
two
taxes,
the
axle
tax
and
the
marker
fee
which
are
imposed
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania
on
trucks
that
travel
over
its
highways.
appellants
challenge
both
of
these
taxes
under
the
commerce
clause
as
discriminatory
against
truckers
who
engage
in
interstate
operations.
i
should
make
clear
at
the
outset
that
we
do
not
question
the
amount
of
revenues
that
pennsylvania
seeks
to
raise
by
these
taxes.
we
strongly
support
the
right
of
every
state
to
raise
the
funds
which
it
needs
to
keep
its
highways
safe
and
unobstructed.
our
objection
to
these
taxes
goes
only
to
their
discriminatory
character
and
to
the
penalty
which
they
impose
on
those
who
choose
to
participate
in
interstate
commerce.
i
would
like
to
begin
today
with
a
discussion
of
our
flat
tax
challenge
which
relates
to
both
the
marker
fee
and
the
axle
tax.
the
marker
fee
charged
a
flat
sum
of
$25
per
truck.
the
axle
tax
charges
$36
per
axle.
that
is
$180
for
almost
every
truck
that
travels
in
interstate
commerce.
under
the
axle
tax
a
truck
that
travels
a
few
thousand
miles
in
pennsylvania
pays
the
same
amount
as
a
truck
that
travels
ten,
twenty,
or
fifty
times
as
much.
truckers
from
other
states
who
are
light
users
of
pennsylvania's
highways
end
up
paying
the
same
amount
as
local
truckers
who
use
the
highways
on
a
regular
basis.
the
result
is
a
cost
per
mile
that
is
much
higher
on
the
average
for
the
out-of-state
trucker
than
for
the
in-state
trucker,
and
that,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
on
several
occasions,
is
the
inherent
discriminatory
effect
of
a
flat
tax
which
favors
local
users
and
disfavors
users
from
other
states
whose
business
requires
them
to
move
across
the
country
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
court's
recent
opinions
have
made
clear
that
the
measure
of
the
tax
has
to
be
geared
in
some
respect
to
the
extent
of
the
taxpayer's
in-state
presence
and
activity.
ordinarily
when
we
are
discussing
usage
of
the
highway
that
would
be
mileage
but
it
may
be
mileage
along
with
weight
or
other
factors.
there
is
no
single
way
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
could
be
hours
on
the
road.
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
are
many
flat
taxes
that
do
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
at
all.
the
nippert
problem
arises--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--but
is
isn't
necessarily
commerce
clause
discrimination
unless
the
out-of-state
taxpayer
is
burdened
in
a
way
that
the
in-state
taxpayer
is
not.
the
nippert
problem
arises--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
this
court
did,
of
course,
in
nippert,
and
i
would
like
to
make
clear
what
the
nippert
problem
is.
when
a
taxpayer
moves
in
interstate
commerce
from
state
to
state
and
can
only
spend
a
limited
amount
of
time
in
any
particular
state,
that
is
where
this
problem
is
at
its
most
acute.
in
order
to
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
flat
tax
that
the
local
taxpayer
gets
he'd
have
to
give
up
the
interstate
business.
inherently
he
is
spending
2
percent
or
5
percent
of
his
time
in
each
state
around
the
country,
and
when
he
faces
a
large,
unapportioned
flat
tax
in
state
after
state
after
state,
that
is
what
produces
the
difficulty
for
the
interstate
carrier.
as
i
have
suggested
to
justice
scalia,
the
real
problem
here
is
the
problem
of
cumulative
burdens
which
the
trucker
faces
when
he
passes
from
state
to
state
and
he
gets
hit
by
flat
taxes
again
and
again.
we
now
have
these
flat
taxes
in
seven
different
states,
and
additional
states
are
now
considering
them.
this
means
that
the
cost
of
engaging
in
a
multi-state
trucking
business
gets
higher
and
higher
the
more
the
taxpayer
attempts
to
participate
in
our
national
common
market
economy.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
congress
is
taking
a
look
only
at
the
administrative
facets
of
state
taxation
of
highways.
it
is
not
looking
at
the
substance
of
the
taxes,
the
discriminatory
content
of
the
taxes,
and
we
think
that
is
the
significant--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--there
is
no
question
that
the
aero
mayflower--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
i
think
the
precedents
are
the
heart
of
this,
and
i
would
like
to
address
them
in
some
detail.
we
say
that
these
precedents
have
been
out
of
step
with
this
court's
recent
decision
ever
since
the
complete
auto
decision
and
ever
since
commonwealth
edison.
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
now
the
measure
of
the
taxes
had
to
be
related
to
the
extent
of
the
taxpayer's
in-state
presence
and
activity,
so
the
law
changed,
we
say,
with
the
watershed
decision
in
complete
auto
and
in
commonwealth
edison.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
no
question
that
the
cases
have
continued
to
be
cited.
in
the
massachusetts
case
we
were
talking
about
a
tax
by
the
united
states,
a
single
sovereign.
there
was
no
problem
of
cumulative
burdens
there,
and
every
taxpayer
had
a
voice
in
the
councils
of
the
federal
government,
and
this
court
placed
great
emphasis
on
that.
now,
the
out-of-state
drivers
don't
have
any
voice
in
the
pennsylvania
legislature
when
this
discriminatory
legislation
is
imposed,
and
i
think
if
the
court
focuses
on
the
economic
realities
of
these
cumulative
burdens
it
will
be
clear
that
the
more
modern
approach
under
this
court's
decisions
is
the
applicable
approach.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
a
critical
issue,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
every
state
in
the
united
states
has
mileage
based
taxes
today.
seventy
or
80
percent
of
all
highway
taxes
in
every
state
are
raised
by
this
mileage
based
system,
including
pennsylvania,
and
so
to
say
that
the
system
is
not
in
place
to
collect
more
money
in
a
nondiscriminatory
way
is
just
wrong.
pennsylvania's
brief
concedes
this
point,
that
most
of
their
taxes
are
raised
by
their
fuel
taxes,
registration
fees,
apportioned
income
tax,
so
there
really
is
no
administrative
convenience
argument
left
which
favors
this
flat
tax
approach.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
our
submission
is
that
the
nondiscriminatory
taxes
such
as
the
fuel
taxes,
they
are
already
in
place.
the
collection
systems
are
operating.
the
enforcement
mechanism
is
there.
they
simply
need
to
be
raised.
we
have
advocated
raises
in
the
fuel
taxes
in
several
states.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
in
the
nippert
case
this
court
pointed
out
if
there
are
less
discriminatory
alternatives
available
to
the
state
that
is
of
critical
importance
in
deciding
whether
the
discrimination
can
be
countenanced
under
the
constitution.
now,
here
we
have
every
state
in
the
country
using
these
nondiscriminatory
alternatives.
there
are
only
a
handful
of
states
that
have
relied
on
the
flat
taxes.
pennsylvania
itself
raises
most
of
its
taxes
through
nondiscriminatory
taxes.
there
simply
is
no
need
to
raise
money
by
a
discriminatory
tax,
and
i
think
the
court
will
appreciate
the
importance
of
this
if
you
consider
one
example
that
demonstrates
the
economic
impact
of
these
flat
taxes.
if
every
state
in
the
country
had
a
flat
tax
just
like
the
pennsylvania
axle
tax,
that
would
mean
a
trucker
with
a
local
business
in
pennsylvania
would
pay
a
maximum
of
$180
in
this
flat
tax,
but
if
a
trucker
spread
the
same
number
of
total
miles
over
a
48-state
basis
it
would
cost
that
trucker
$9,000.
that
is
the
penalty
for
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
that
is
the
cost
which
is
attached
to
letting
your
business
participate
in
the
national
common
market
economy.
now,
if
you
have
a
fleet
of
trucks,
a
thousand
trucks,
the
penalty
is
$9
million.
these
are
enormous
penalties
for
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
are
many
taxes
such
as
head
taxes
or
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
many
different
formulas
for
raising
these
taxes,
and
in
the
lion's
share
of
the
cases
they
don't
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
which
is
the
particular--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--problem
here
that
we
are
concerned
with.
i
think
it
is
an
important
constitutional
problem
because
these
cumulative
burdens
penalize
those
who
choose
to
carry
goods
across
state
borders.
and
they
discourage
the
operation
of
a
nationwide
trucking
business.
they
discourage
the
operation
of
trucking
services
that
cross
over
state
borders.
they
are
a
direct
penalty
for
choosing
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
is
virtually
definitional
by
these
taxes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
for
the
greater
cost,
yes.
it
is
in
the
record
in
this
case.
the
cost
per
mile
is
five
times
as
high
for
the
out-of-state--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
this
court
reached
that
very
conclusion
in
the
nippert
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
other
than
what
we
have
submitted
in
the
record,
there
is
not
a
study
of
this
problem.
we
would
like
to
emphasize
before
turning
in
greater
detail
to
these
flat
tax
cases
that
justice
o'connor
has
referred
to
what
we
believe
the
governing
commerce
clause
standard
is
in
a
case
like
this.
we
begin
with
the
complete
auto
decision,
which
teaches
that
judicial
review
today
must
focus
on
the
practical
economic
effect
of
these
statutes
and
not
on
the
labels
which
are
attached
to
them,
and
the
court
made
clear
in
complete
auto
that
a
tax
that
falls
on
interstate
commerce
must
be
nondiscriminatory
in
its
practical
operation
and
it
must
be
fairly
related
to
the
services
which
are
provided
by
the
state.
now,
in
the
nippert
case
this
court
explained
the
discriminatory
practical
impact
of
a
flat
tax
when
it
invalidated
a
flat
tax
that
fell
on
traveling
salesmen.
the
court
explained,
and
i
quote,
"the
very
difference
between
interstate
and
local
trade
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
inherent
character
of
the
tax
makes
equality
of
application
of
the
tax
to
these
two
classes
of
commerce
impossible.
"
the
court
emphasized
that
this
discrimination
is
not
just
a
matter
of
looking
at
one
single
state
in
isolation,
but
there
are
cumulative
burdens
as
these
large
flat
taxes
are
laid
in
succession
on
persons
across
the
country
to
conduct
their
business.
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
armco
and
in
other
recent
cases
that
the
tax
must
not
impose
unacceptable
discrimination
if
every
state
in
the
united
states
were
to
adopt
that
tax,
and
we
think
that
the
constitutional
infirmity
here
is
evident
when
you
project
these
flat
taxes
onto
a
50-state
basis
and
you
ask
what
would
happen
if
every
state
had
an
axle
tax
and
it
cost
$9,000
to
conduct
the
same
business
on
a
multistate
basis
than
it
would
cost
if
you
confined
your
operations
to
a
single
state.
now,
in
commonwealth
edison,
this
court
also
explained
that
under
the
modern,
pragmatic
approach
to
commerce
clause
issues,
a
tax
won't
pass
muster
unless
its
measure
is
fairly
related
to
the
services
provided
by
the
state.
the
formula
for
measuring
the
tax
has
to
be
geared
to
the
in-state
presence
and
activity
of
the
taxpayer.
now,
in
this
case,
it
is
undisputed
that
the
measure
of
the
tax
is
not
related
to
the
taxpayer's
presence
or
activities
in
pennsylvania.
the
very
purpose
of
this
tax
is
to
raise
money
for
highway
maintenance
and
highway
upkeep,
yet
the
local
trucker
who
travels
100,000
miles
on
the
highway
pays
the
same
thing
as
an
out-of-state
trucker
who
comes
in
and
puts
in
two
or
three
or
four
thousand
miles
on
the
highway,
even
though
the
local
trucker
may
be
causing
50
times
as
much
wear
on
the
highway
system.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
those
problems,
of
course,
are
not
commerce
clause
problems.
if
the
out-of-state
interstate
carrier
is
disadvantaged,
that
is
the
commerce
clause
concern.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
do
say
if
there
is
a
practical
economic
effect
of
discriminating,
that
that
is
as
bad
as
the
bad
purpose.
now,
the
court
has
said
that
on
many
occasions,
most
recently
in
the
bacchus
case,
and
these
discriminatory
effects,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out,
have
not
been
overlooked
by
the
other
states
which
now
retaliate
against
flat
taxes.
we
have
eight
states
already
which
retaliate
against
the
axle
tax,
and
in
a
special
report
that
we
have
lodged
with
the
court,
the
pennsylvania
legislature
has
made
a
study
of
the
effect
of
that
retaliation,
and
it
has
found
that
the
retaliation
is
"devastating
to
the
state's
motor
carrier
industry.
"
this
is
the
real
world
interstate
impact
of
the
axle
tax.
it
is
producing
a
virtual
trade
war
among
the
states,
and
one
that
is
very
injurious
to
interstate
trucking
activity.
now,
despite
all
these
discriminatory
effects
reliance
is
placed
on
the
aero
mayflower
line
of
cases
referred
to
by
justice
o'connor,
and
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
talking
about
them
because
they
are
quite
important.
the
principal
rationale
in
aero
mayflower
was
that
a
flat
tax
is
reasonable
because
it
pays
for
the
"privilege"
of
highway
use.
the
court
reasoned
that
it
wasn't
the
state's
fault
if
the
driver
didn't
make
full
use
of
that
privilege
after
paying
for
it.
this,
we
say,
is
the
kind
of
reliance
on
abstractions
rather
than
dollars
and
cents
effects
which
complete
auto
has
put
behind
us.
the
privilege
rationale
ignores
the
fact
that
a
truck
can't
be
in
more
than
one
state
at
one
time.
so
an
interstate
trucker
who
is
forced
to
pay
a
substantial
unapportioned
flat
tax
in
state
after
state
for
a
privilege
he
can
use
only
occasionally
in
any
particular
state
is
placed
at
a
serious
competitive
disadvantage.
the
only
way
to
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
privilege,
in
other
words,
is
to
give
up
the
interstate
business
and
become
a
local
operator
who
can
drive
50,
60,
or
70,000
miles
on
the
highway.
now,
the
other
point
that
was
relied
on
in
aero
mayflower
was
administrative
convenience
that
the
court
has
referred
to
in
the
argument,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
almost
all
of
the
highway
taxes
today
are
raised
by
nondiscriminatory
means.
the
state
can
simply
rely
more
substantially
on
existing
nondiscriminatory
taxes
which
are
already
in
place.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
fuel
purchase,
fuel
use
taxes,
the
gross
receipts
tax,
which
is
mileage-based
in
pennsylvania,
the
apportioned
registration
fee.
all
of
these
are
mileage-geared
taxes
not
only
in
effect
in
pennsylvania
but
in
every
other
state
in
the
country,
so
we
say
that
the
discrimination
that
is
inherent
in
the
flat
taxes
can't
logically
be
justified
today
by
reference
to
administrative
convenience.
the
existing
nondiscriminatory
taxes
can
simply
be
raised,
as
they
regularly
are,
in
states
across
the
country.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
they
pay
a
very
substantially
higher
cost
per
mile
in
any--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--they
are
competing
with
local
business
for
local
carriage
of
commerce.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
is
that
discriminatory
effect.
there
is
a
second
and
more
important
one,
and
that
is,
there
is
a
discrimination
against
those
who
wish
to
engage
in
a
50-state
commercial
activity.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
is
competition
from
the
out-of-staters
for
that
local
business
of
picking
up
and
dropping
off.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
they
are
not
competing
for
the
local
carriage.
that
is
true.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
they
are
being
discriminated
in
the
sense
that
the
flat
tax
regime
makes
it
prohibitively
expensive
to
engage
in
this
50-state
operation
compared
to
the
local
operation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
we
certainly
do.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
a
penalty
for
engaging
in
interstate
operations.
it
vulcanizes
the
trucking
industry.
it
creates
pressure
to
operate
on
a
local
scale.
that
is
the
principal
commerce
cause
objection.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
court
has
to
view
this
as
a
situation
where
states
across
the
country
have
flat
taxes.
now,
if
a
trucker
is
asked
to
pick
up
the
goods
on
the
east
coast
and
take
them
to
the
west,
if
he
has
to
pay
flat
tax
in
state
after
state,
even
though
he
is
making
light
use
of
the
highways
in
each
state,
that
is
going
to
discourage
interstate
operations
categorically.
it
is
going
to
put
pressure
on
truckers
to
organize
their
services
on
a
local
or
a
regional
basis,
and
we
say
that
is
a
core
commerce
clause
concern.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
the
vulcanizing
effect.
we
don't
know
that
these
consequences,
of
course,
are
going
to
occur
that
starkly,
but
that
is
the
economic
tendency
of
making
it
far
more
expensive
to
operate
a
business
that
spills
over
state
lines.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
axle
tax
is
being
replicated--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
the
court
has
said
that
even
small
amounts
of
discrimination
are
not
acceptable
under
the
commerce
clause.
there
was
an
$8,000
discrimination
in
the
westinghouse
case
which
invalidated
the
tax.
here
we
are
talking
about
a
much
more
substantial
dollar
amount,
is
our
submission.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
don't
attack
the
$5
fee.
that
illustrates
my
observation
earlier
that
not
every
flat
tax
has
a
discriminatory
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
there
are
some
flat
taxes
that
simply
cover
the
cost
of
providing
a
particular
service
to
you.
everybody
pays
the
same
thing.
everybody
receives
the
same
thing.
five
dollars
for
your
decal.
that
is
the
cost
of
giving
you
the
decal.
or
$10
for
towing.
we
don't
object
to
that
kind
of
tax.
we
object
to
the
revenue-raising
tax
which
is
laid
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
where
the
interstate
operator
gets
much
less
use
than
the
in-state
operator
for
the
payment
of
$180
or
$25,
but
we
don't
challenge
flat
taxes
categorically,
and
i
think
that
is
an
important
concept.
now,
the
last
point
that
was
relied
on
in
the
aero
mayflower
case
was
the
court's
belief
that
flat
taxes
don't
create
a
substantial
burden
on
anybody,
and
this,
as
i
have
been
driving
at
earlier,
is
simply
not
a
tenable
rationale
today.
in
contrast
to
the
days
of
aero
mayflower,
the
trucking
industry
today
is
made
up
of
truckers,
many
of
whom
engage
in
business
in
all
48
states.
these
trucks
are
facing
a
rising
tide
of
flat
taxes
across
the
country.
we
are
talking
about
smaller
companies
and
we
are
also
talking
about
larger
companies
that
may
have
several
thousand
trucks
in
their
fleet,
each
of
which
has
to
be
qualified
in
every
state
in
the
union
in
order
to
bring
goods
from
the
east
coast
to
the
west
coast
or
from
the
north
to
the
south,
and
we
say
that
these
accumulating
burdens
are
very
far
from
insubstantial
or
minimal.
these
burdens,
we
say,
are
also
in
no
sense
counterbalanced
or
justified
by
the
registration
fee
which
pennsylvania
charges
to
its
own
truckers.
the
argument
has
been
made
that
a
large
registration
fee
is
imposed
on
local
truckers.
the
fact
is
that
pennsylvania's
registration
fee
is
just
at
the
median
in
the
united
states
today.
the
average
was
$910
at
the
beginning
of
this
year.
their
fee
is
$945.
the
range
is
from
$36
up
to
$2,200
in
my
home
state
of
illinois,
so
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
their
registration
fee,
and
in
addition
to
that
it
is
a
nondiscriminatory
system.
everybody
gets
treated
fairly
under
the
registration
system.
everybody
gets
the
benefit
of
apportionment.
everybody
gets
the
benefit
of
reciprocity
when
they
travel
over
other
reciprocity
states.
truckers
in
each
state
get
the
benefit
of
the
nondiscriminatory
nationwide
registration
system,
including
truckers
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
now,
we
submit,
in
short,
that
the
practical
approach
to
commerce
clause
issues
which
has
been
taken
by
this
court
in
its
most
recent
decisions
teaches
that
aero
mayflower
can
no
longer
be
invoked
to
defend
flat
taxes
which
impose
these
cumulative
burdens
on
commerce
which
fall
to
satisfy
the
internal
consistency
principle
when
you
consider
these
taxes
on
a
48-state
basis--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
i
don't
speak
generally
to
that
issue,
but
in
this
case
we
have
stipulations
for
a
refund
from
the
state
that
has
dealt
with
that.
we
moved
for...
we
were
prepared
to
move
for
an
escrow,
and
the
state
said,
no,
there
is
no
need
to
go
for
an
escrow
here,
we
can
stipulate
to
a
refund
in
the
event
that
this
is
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
this
litigation,
justice
o'connor,
was
commenced
immediately
after
the
effective
date
of
these
taxes.
it
is
as
if
these
funds
have
been
place
in
limbo
pending
the
outcome
of
this
litigation,
and
we
think
it
would
be
very
destructive
to
the
policies
of
the
commerce
clause
to
permit
those
that
have
been
discriminated
against
and
injured
by
these
exactions
to
go
uncompensated,
and
the
state
agreed
with
us
because
they
stipulated
to
a
refund
of
these
sums,
and
i
think
that
that
takes
care
of
the
refund
issue
in
this
case.
now,
of
course,
we
have
a
second
commerce
clause
challenge
in
this
case
which
relates
to
the
facial
or
the
structural
discrimination
issue,
and
that,
of
course,
is
focused
in
solely
on
the
axle
tax.
the
essence
of
this
contention
is
that
this
statute
discriminated
on
its
face.
section
3
of
the
statute
imposed
the
new
tax.
section
1
of
the
statute
granted
an
offsetting
reduction
for
local
business.
we
say
that
this
is
squarely
within
the
holding
of
maryland
versus
louisiana,
where
a
general
tax
was
imposed
on
commerce,
offsetting
reductions
were
given
to
local
business.
we
are
met
in
defense
of
the
statute
with
the
argument
that
even
though
there
is
no
compensatory
tax
doctrine
defense
here,
that
the
whole
arrangement
should
be
defended
and
accepted
because
it
constitutes
a
rational
restructuring
of
tax
burdens.
now,
the
important
thing,
i
think,
to
bear
in
mind
about
this
rational
restructuring
argument
is
that
there
isn't
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
anyone
was
engaged
in
a
rational
restructuring
of
tax
burdens.
the
statute
says
on
its
face
that
its
purpose
was
to
rehabilitate
bridges
and
give
jobs
to
local
residents.
there
isn't
a
single
word
said
about
adjusting
or
rearranging
tax
burdens
to
come
up
with
an
equitable
solution
that
wouldn't
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
the
court
is
being
asked
to
accept
a
new
doctrine,
an
unstructured
doctrine,
this
rational
readjustment
doctrine,
with
absolutely
no
basis
in
the
statute
or
its
history
to
suggest
that
that
was
what
was
going
on.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
rest
on
our
briefs
which
deal
with
the
facial
discrimination
issue
in
greater
detail
and
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
just
have
a
few
additional
comments,
mr.
chief
justice.
th
argument
was
made
by
my
colleague
that
the
state
really
can't
rely
on
mileage-based
taxes
or
taxes
that
are
geared
to
in-state
presence
and
activity.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
10,
footnote
13
of
pennsylvania's
brief,
which
shows
that
$131
million
in
highway
revenues
came
from
fuel
taxes,
$80
million
came
from
registration
fees
which
were
apportioned
based
on
mileage,
another
$10
million
came
from
the
motor
carrier
road
tax,
which
is
a
mileage
tax,
only
$123
million
came
from
the
flat
tax,
the
marker
fee.
this
hardly
suggests
that
the
revenues
needed
for
highway
upkeep
can't
be
raised
by
nondiscriminatory
taxes.
now,
we
are
not
asking
for
perfection.
we
are
not
asking
for
any
system
that
is
related,
tied
to
one
factor
or
another.
we
ask
only
that
the
court
standard
that
the
tax
in
its
measure
be
related
to
in-state
presence
and
activity,
that
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--quite
to
the
contrary,
we
don't
contend
that.
on
the
average
that
is
so,
but
some
of
the
biggest
victims
of
this
system
are
the
pennsylvania
interstate
truckers
who
get
hit
not
only
with
flat
taxes
in
seven
different
states--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--but
retaliatory
taxes
in
eight
more
states.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
take
the
position
that
it
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
was
the
holding
in
nippert.
the
very
same
point--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--was
observed
by
the
court
in
nippert,
and
we
think
it
is
correct.
on
the
average,
there
is
a
much
greater
impact
on
the
interstate
operator
who
can't
be--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
correct.
i
would
also
like
to
comment
on
the
observation
that
the
bridges
need
to
be
repaired
in
this
state.
nobody
agrees
with
that
more
than
us.
who
gets
hurt
by
defective
bridges
and
highways
more
than
the
truckers?
they
depend
for
their
own
safety
on
the
solidity--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
individual
drivers,
of
course,
but
we
suggest
that
even
though
these
are
legitimate
state
objectives
that
the
constitutional
rule
which
forbids
discrimination
in
raising
these
funds
is
so
vitally
important
here,
we
are
talking
about
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce,
trucking.
three-quarters
of
the
dollar
value
of
the
commerce
in
the
united
states
moves
by
truck
today.
and
yet
we
have
taxes
here
that
discriminate
on
their
face,
discriminate
in
their
actual
operation
against
interstate
commerce,
and
which
put
pressure
on
the
trucker
not
to
operate
on
a
basis
across
the
state
lines.
the
comment
was
made
by
my
colleague
that
we
are
talking
about
a
corridor
state
here.
well,
that
cuts
two
ways.
the
founding
fathers
in
the
debates
on
the
commerce
clause
pointed
out
that
no
corridor
state
should
be
in
a
position
to
bleed
interstate
commerce
or
to
blockade
it
through
discrimination.
that
is
what
we
say
these
taxes
amount
to.
now,
again,
in
summation,
pennsylvania
has
argued
for
a
broad
economic
approach
to
the
issue.
we
don't
disagree
with
that
kind
of
broad
brush
economic
approach,
but
we
would
ask
the
court
to
remember
the
rest
of
the
states
in
the
union
when
considering
these
arguments
and
to
consider
the
impact
of
these
cumulative
burdens
that
justice
o'connor
mentioned
on
transportation
throughout
the
united
states
as
opposed
to--
