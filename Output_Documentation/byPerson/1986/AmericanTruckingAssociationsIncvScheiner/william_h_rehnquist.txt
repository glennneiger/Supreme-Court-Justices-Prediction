chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-357,
american
trucking
associations
versus
james
i.
scheiner.
mr.
shapiro,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
is
right,
mr.
shapiro.
the
kind
of
mileage
based
taxes
you
refer
to,
fuel
tax
and
that
sort
of
a
thing,
are
really
kind
of
self-regulating,
but
here
what
you
would
have
pennsylvania
do
is
to
somehow
by
voluntary
declaration,
i
guess,
find
out
the
number
of
miles
each
truck
travels
in
pennsylvania.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
principle
to
just
say
it
would
be
better
if
pennsylvania
did
it
the
way
we
wanted
it
to.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
some
empirical
support
for
the
proposition
you
just
state,
or
is
that
just
pretty
much
speculation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
is
there
empirical
support
for
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
mean
empirical
support
for
the
proposition
that
the
sort
of
system
pennsylvania
has
discourages
out-of-state
trucks.
i
mean,
have
there
been
surveys?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
am
asking
about
whether
there
has
been
empirical
evidence
saying
that
there
are
fewer
trucks
coming
into
pennsylvania
because
of
the
kind
of
tax
system
it
has.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
in
effect
that
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
interstate
business
of
trucking
stuff
from
new
york
to
san
francisco,
that
it
is
all
going
to
be
transshipped
at
each
state
border
if
your
view
doesn't
prevail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
wolfe.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
you
could
at
some
cost
set
up
weighing
stations
at
the
border
of
the
state
where
you
come
in
from,
say,
between
binghamton
and
scranton
coming
down,
what,
81,
is
it,
and
then
if
you
are
driving
all
the
way
through
coming
out
south
of
gettysburg,
and
just
ask
the
driver
for
a
declaration
of
how
many
miles
in
the
state,
or
maybe
check
odometers.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
pennsylvania
has
a
self-reporting
system.
did
you
mean
new
york
has
a
self-reporting
system?
chief
justice
rehnquist
pennsylvania
does?
chief
justice
rehnquist
most
of
those
weigh
stations
that
i
have
seen
have
always
had
a
"closed"
sign
on
them.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wolfe.
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
shapiro.
the
case
is
submitted.
