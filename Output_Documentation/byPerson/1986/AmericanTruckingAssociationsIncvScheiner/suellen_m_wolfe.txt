ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
two
reasons
why
pennsylvania's
axle
tax
is
constitutional.
first
of
all,
flat
user
fees
have
formed
a
vital
part
of
the
tax
schemes
of
all
the
states.
they
are
easy
to
administer
and
fair
in
their
application.
so
long
as
they
are
reasonably
related
to
the
services
rendered
by
the
state,
they
have
been
considered
constitutional.
the
constitutionality
of
these
taxes
has
been
upheld
for
almost
100
years.
and
the
appellants
have
just
pointed
out
that
they
do
not
contest
that
pennsylvania's
axle
tax
is
excessive.
the
second
reason
is
that
the
appellants
stress
the
fact
that
when
pennsylvania
enacted
its
axle
tax
it
reduced
registration
fees
in
an
equivalent
amount.
however,
what
they
don't
stress
is
that
in
1980
pennsylvania
had
raised
its
registration
fees
in
the
same
amount.
that
means
the
only
effect
of
the
1982
drop
in
registration
fees
was
to
restore
pennsylvania's
tax
scheme
to
its
status
quo
before
imposing
an
axle
tax
on
all
trucks
using
pennsylvania's
highways.
the
appellants
request
this
court
to
invalidate
flat
fees.
there
is
no
way
to
assess
a
particular
user
of
a
user
system
such
as
a
highway
system
with
his
particular
portion
of
the
cost.
that
is
because
the
costs
are
generated
by
so
many
factors.
in
a
highway
system
it
can
be
generated
by
weight,
by
mileage,
and
by
configuration.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
that
is
a
possibility,
your
honor,
but
you
must
understand
that
that
requires
of
the
state
a
great
administrative
cost,
and
if
you
would
do
that
there...
you
are
requesting
the
state
to
rely
on
one
factor
in
a
system
where
the
costs
are
generated
by
many
factors.
if
in
fact
the
court
would
accept
the
proposition
that
a
user
fee
is
by
its
nature
discriminatory
and
unconstitutional,
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
it
would
create
chaos
in
all
of
the
50
states.
these
states
use
these
types
of
fees
because
they
have
found
that
they
are
administratively
convenient,
they
are
fair
in
their
application,
and--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
for
highway
systems?
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
i
believe
at
this
point
there
are
only
seven
states
that
are
imposing
a
flat
fee,
and
you
have
to
understand
pennsylvania's
situation
to
also
understand
why
we
decided
to
enact
the
axle
tax.
pennsylvania
has
very
hilly
terrain,
has
very
heavy
truck
traffic,
and
has
very
difficult
weather
and
climate
conditions.
in
addition,
our
bridges
are
in
dire
need
of
repair.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
the
weather
conditions
are
very
cold
as
compared
to
the
southern
part
of
the
nation,
which
causes
stress--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
it
is
a
combination
of
factors,
that
pennsylvania
has
a
unique
situation.
the
weather
in
combination
with
the
terrain,
the
heavy
truck
traffic
has
generated
great
damage
to
the
highways.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
i
am
not
aware
of
the
fact
whether
new
york
imposes
a
flat
tax.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
yes,
absolutely,
and
they
also
have
a
very--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--they
have
a
very...
i
believe
the
wall
street
journal
indicated
that
pennsylvania
and
new
york
have
the
most
severe
situation
so
far
as
the
condition
and
the
damage
of
their
bridges.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
absolutely.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
we
had
the
first
turnpike.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
yes.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
the
appellants
go
on
to
suggest
that
the
mileage-related
fuel
tax
is
the
talisman
to
these
flat
taxes.
but
as
i
indicated
before,
the
administrative
ease
that
the
appellants
contend
is
possible
today
is
not
in
existence
in
pennsylvania.
new
york
has
imposed
a
system
and
it
is
in
the
record
that
it
created
tremendous
cost.
and
quite
simply
pennsylvania
as
a
self-reporting
system
now.
self-reporting
systems
don't
work.
that
is
why
we
have
withholding
in
personal
income
tax.
in
order
to--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--no,
for
the
mileage
taxes.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
yes.
in
other
words,
we
have
to
take
the
truckers'
words
for
the
amount
of
mileages
that
they
travel
in
the
state,
and
we
do
that.
it
is
an
honor
system.
but
it
doesn't
work.
if
in
fact
we
went
to
a
completely
mileage-based
system,
that
would
impose
upon
the
state
a
tremendous
administrative
burden.
we
would
have
to
have
an
audit
function
in
place.
there
is
also
a
need
for
a
control
factor
in
these
state
schemes.
the
bridges
and
the
highways
have
got
to
be
there
for
the
convenience
of
the
user,
the
trucks.
whether
those
trucks
use
it
one
time
or
600
times,
they
want
that
particular
bridge
or
that
particular
highway
there
in
good
condition
when
they
want
to
use
it.
i
will
now
revert
back
to
the
other
issue,
and
that
is
the
discrimination,
and
i
believe
it
is
a
fairly--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--i'm
not...
most
states
have
a
mileage-based
tax,
but
i
believe
they
have
those
taxes
in
combination
with
other
taxes.
i
don't
believe
they
rely
solely--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--well,
they
administer
it...
apparently
they
do,
but
i
am
saying
pennsylvania
probably
isn't
comparable.
we
have
huge
numbers
involved
here,
and
our
numbers
are,
for
instance,
i
would
say,
$1
billion
a
year
that
we
have
to
generate,
and
i
am
saying
that
we
don't
have
the
facilities
to
audit
those
types
of
numbers
at
the
present
time.
i
am
not
sure
whether
those
states
that
have
the
43
mileage,
and
we
have
a
mileage
system,
too,
in
our
fuel
taxes.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
no,
pennsylvania
has
a
maximum
weight,
and
we
have
weigh
stations
along
certain
highways
where
on
occasion
they
have
to
pull
over,
but
there
is
nothing
at
the
entrance
of
the
state
and
when
they
leave
the
state
to
actually
weigh
a
truck,
and
that
goes
to
show
you
administrative
inconvenience
also.
if
in
fact
we
went
to
a
pure
weight
system,
the
truckers
would
be
the
first
ones
to
complain
that
they
would
have
to
stop--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
i
imagine
they
keep
records,
because--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--i
am
not
positive,
but
i
presume
what
they
are
doing
is
in
fact
trying
to
have
support
information
to
ascertain
whether
their
system
is
fair,
because
once
they
see
that
they
are
having
a
lot
of
heavy
vehicles,
maybe
they
should
shift
away
from
one
type
of
tax
and
into
another.
it
is
a
consideration
of
the
legislature--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--yes,
they
are.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
yes,
they
are.
it
is
illegal.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
and
the
truckers
are
very
happy
about
that,
too.
i
would
like
to
address
just
for
one
moment
without
delaying
on
the
flat
fee
argument
any
more
or
on
this
system
of
the
highways
of
pennsylvania
unless
the
court
has
any
additional
questions,
to
address
the
discrimination
issue
which
the
appellants
contend
exists
because
of
the
fact
that
pennsylvania
lowered
the
registration
fees
in
the
same
act
which
enacted
the
axle
tax.
at
first
blush
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
admitted
it
looked
to
be
discriminatory,
but
as
i
said
before,
those
two
events
were
essentially
unrelated.
they
are
not
equivalent
taxes.
and
if
we
presume,
for
instance,
that
we
started
in
1980,
the
registration
fees
as
a
flat
playing
field,
we
increased
registration
fees
in
1980.
in
1982,
we
decreased
registration
fees
and
imposed
the
axle
tax.
the
system
is
not
discriminatory
at
all.
it
brought
the
system
back
to
the
pre-1980
level
and
imposed
an
axle
tax
on
all
trucks
using
pennsylvania's
highways
regardless
of
whether
they
were
registered
in
the
state--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--it
is
very
similar.
there
was
just
a
straight...
from
1980
to
1983
there
was
a
slight
increase
in
the
registration
fee.
in
other
words,
pennsylvania
trucks
paid
slightly
more,
and
that
is
illustrated,
i
believe,
in
the
record.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
you
are
absolutely
correct,
but
basically
they
shifted
the
burden
to
the--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--it
was
a
coincidence
of
timing,
i
would
call
it.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
yes.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
no,
he
was
not
persuaded
by
that.
i
think
that
justice
nix
refused
to
look
also
beyond
the
two
taxes
involved
to
the
entire
scheme
to
see
that
it
works
equitably.
despite
the
appellant's
attempt
to
really
mischaracterize
this
case,
there
is
no
discrimination.
they
really
launched
upon
a
constitutional
attack
by
seizing
upon
the
fact
that
the
1982
act
changed
two
taxes
in
pennsylvania's
comprehensive
tax
scheme.
that
tax
scheme
really
includes
14
taxes
which
takes
into
consideration
late
mileage
and
configuration.
in
fact,
the
axle
tax
is
proportional
because
it
gives...
weight-related.
it's
according
to
the
number
of
axles
that
the
trucks
have.
it
also
gives
a
rebate
for
trucks
traveling
less
than
2,000
miles.
the
two
taxes,
the
axle
tax
and
the
registration
fees,
are
entirely
unrelated
and
certainly
not
equivalent.
and
so
long
as
this
court
looks
beyond
timing
to
ultimate
effect
as
it
always
has,
and
so
long
as
this
court
is
willing
to
reaffirm
flat
user
fees
as
a
viable
component
of
the
taxing
system
of
the
50
states
of
the
united
states,
the
challenged
taxes
will
stand.
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
threat.
i
believe
that
as
the
trucks
move
interstate
they
are
receiving
a
cumulative
benefit,
and
they
have
to
be
asked
to
pay
for
that
cumulative
benefit,
and
also
with
regard
to
a
user
fee
certainly
each
state's
law
or
user
fee
must
pass
its
own
rigid
test
according
to
the
aero
mayflower.
it
must
be
reasonably
related.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
i
recognize
the
fact
that
interstate
commerce
should
pay
its
own
way
and
that
they
are
enjoying
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
business
in
many
states.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
i
am
saying
that--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--i
am
saying
that
i
don't
foresee
a
cumulative
problem--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--i--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--if
such
a
system
would
be
possible
to
achieve,
that
would
be
the
best
way
probably.
we
never
define
what
factors
are
responsible.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
not
at
this
point.
i
believe
truly
that
there
is
no
direct
evidence
that
mileage
is
the
right
way.
there's
too
many
factors,
too
many
variables,
and
certainly
congress
looks
at
this
every
year,
and
has
made
the
same
determination,
and
if
they
in
fact
saw
the
cumulative
problem
they
could
easily
step
in.
and
just
one
more
thing
i
would
like
to
say
is,
i
have
not
heard
anything
about
the
number
of
revenues
that
these
trucks
can
raise
by
interstate
commerce.
certainly
they
are
able
to
generate
far
greater
revenues
than
just
participating
in
business
in
one
state.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
i
don't
know
if
i
understand
your
question.
what
i
am
saying
is,
pennsylvania's
system
is
proportional.
we
do
take
other
factors
into
consideration.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
the
flat--
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
--it
does
according
to
weight,
yes,
according
to
the
axles,
which
are
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
axles
you
have
basically.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
well
i
will
say
that
we
have
no
direct
evidence
that
has
been
submitted
concerning
a
cost
per
mile.
and
i
think
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
brief
that
the
evidence
as
to
mileage
was
objected
to
and
never
has
been
determined
by
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
in
that
there
were
no
factual
findings.
ms.
suellen
m.
wolfe
that
is
exactly
right.
i
think
that
pennsylvania's
overall
system
does
relate
factors
together
to
give
equality
to
all
trucks
using
the
commonwealth's
roads.
