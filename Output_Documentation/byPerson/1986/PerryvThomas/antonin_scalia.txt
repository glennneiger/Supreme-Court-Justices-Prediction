we
don't
really
much
care,
mr.
dolan,
how
california
chooses
to
interpret
section
229.
i
mean,
that's...
you
know,
that
is
what
you
are
up
against.
we
really
don't
care
how
california
chooses
to
interpret
229.
justice
scalia
do
me
one
favor.
that
thing
on
page
33a
of
your
appendix,
which
is
very
hard
to
read,
"i
agree
to
arbitrate
any
dispute,
claim,
or
controversy
that
may.
"
--that
may
what
+/?
"arise
between
me
and
my
firm
or
a
customer
or
any
other
person
that
is
required
to
be
arbitrated
under
the
rules.
"
blah,
blah,
blah.
justice
scalia
now,
you
really
have
to
refer
to
the
rules
to
see
what
a
claim
by
any
other
person
means,
and
how
does
any
other
person
mean
a
co-employee
under
the
arbitration
rules
to
which
this
provision
refers?
justice
scalia
twenty-one.
i've
got
you.
right.
justice
scalia
are
we
dealing
with
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
ware?
unfortunately,
that
is
the
20
percent,
isn't
it
+/?
justice
scalia
--yes,
that's
the
20
percent.
justice
scalia
oh,
that
is
not
so.
i
mean,
perfectly
valid
issues
of
substantive
law
are
given
away
all
the
time
by
failure
of
litigants
to
raise
them.
justice
scalia
the
fact
is,
this
wasn't
raised
or
addressed
in
ware,
was
it?
justice
scalia
i
think
you
are
missing
justice
white's
point.
justice
scalia
i
think
the
point
is
that
it
is
sort
of
the
tail
wagging
the
dog.
if
we
are
going
to
let
our
interpretation
of
a
federal
securities
arbitration
provision
and
as
to
its
preemptive
effect
determine
what
the
preemptive
effect
of
the
much
broader
federal
arbitration
act
is
going
to
be.
that
is
what
you
are
asking
us
to
do.
you
are
asking
us
to
say,
since
we
determine
that
this
little
federal
securities
law
didn't
preempt
any
state
law,
which
covers,
you
know,
relatively...
i
know
to
you
people
here
it
seems
like
the
whole
world,
but
it
is
a
small
aspect
of
human
endeavor.
you
are
saying
that
the
determination
we
made
on
that
has
to
govern
our
interpretation
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
covers
everything.
justice
scalia
are
you
saying
that
the...
is
your
point
that
the
exchange
act
rules,
their
scope
is
a
question
of
federal
law
rather
than
california
law?
justice
scalia
what
about
the
cases
that
mr.
dolan
referred
us
to,
becker
and
another
california--
justice
scalia
--what
difference
would
that
make
as
to
whether--
justice
scalia
--what
about
becker?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
saying.
this
is
unconstitutional?
this
isn't
government
action.
this
is
private
action.
i
assume
two
parties...
suppose
two
parties
agree
by
contract
that
if
there
is
any
dispute
between
them
it
shall
be
resolved
by
a
flip
of
the
coin.
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
scalia
it
is.
justice
scalia
it
is
perfectly
constitutional.
justice
scalia
this
is
a
private
contract.
it
is
not
a
judicial
system.
you
and
i
enter
a
contract,
and
we
decide,
look,
lawyers
are
too
expensive,
if
we
have
a
dispute
we
will
resolve
it
by
a
flip
of
the
coin.
it
is
one
of
the
things
we
agreed
to.
it
is
part
of
the
deal.
justice
scalia
xxx
federal
constitutional
law
of
void
contracts...
contracts
void
because
of
undue
influence
or...
you
know,
there
are
a
lot
of
state
laws
that
make
certain
contracts
unenforceable
because
they
are
oppressive
or
one-sided
or
something,
but
i
never
heard
of
a
theory
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
we
are
going
to
go
around
picking
out
those
contracts
that
are
just
so
egregious
that
they
can't
be
enforced.
do
you
have
any
case
that
says
anything
anywhere
near
that?
i
mean,
california
can
do
that
if
it
wants.
it
can
say
you
can't
enter
into
a
contract
like
this.
you
can't
provide
to
resolve
a
contractual
dispute
by
a
flip
of
the
coin.
they
may
well
say
that,
but
i
never
heard
of
federal
constitutional
policing
of
private
contracts.
justice
scalia
you
want
us
to
take
a
run
at
it.
