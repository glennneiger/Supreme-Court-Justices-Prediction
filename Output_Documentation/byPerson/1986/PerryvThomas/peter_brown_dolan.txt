mr.
peter
brown
dolan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issues
on
this
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
appellate
district
are
whether
that
court
in
affirming
the
order
of
the
los
angeles
county
superior
court
in
denying
the
petition
of
appellants
to
compel
arbitration
of
the
claims
asserted
against
them
first
incorrectly
based
its
decision
squarely
on
whether,
which
it
says
in
so
many
words
in
the
opinion
itself,
whether
it
disregarded
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
southland
versus
keating,
whether
it
failed
to
follow
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
dean
witter
reynolds
versus
byrd
by
refusing
to
sever
the
nonwage
claims
which
it
felt
were
nonarbitrable
under
labor
code
section
29,
and
referring
the
balance
of
the
claims
to
arbitration,
and
whether
it
erred
in
applying
labor
code
section
229
in
the
first
instance,
contrary
to
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
recap
very
quickly
the
chronology
of
the
case
because
we
come
to
you
not
after
a
trial,
and
the
record
is
very
limited.
mr.
thomas,
the
appellee
in
this
case,
is
employed
by
kidder
peabody
in
august
of
1982
as
an
account
executive.
in
prior
years
he
had
also
been
employed
by
other
new
york
stock
exchange
member
firms,
including
morgan
stanley,
e.f.
hutton,
and
kenner
fitzgerald.
i
make
that
observation
because
i
think
it
is
only
fair
to
assume
that
mr.
thomas
either
had
or
should
have
had
a
working
knowledge
of
the
rules
which
he
says
he
read
in
signing
the
u4.
he
had
been
in
the
industry
for
many,
many
years.
rule
347,
which
provides
for
the
arbitration,
is
a
long-standing
rule.
this
court
addressed
it
in
ware
in
1973
and
it
had
been
on
the
books
many
years
before
that.
in
august
of
1982,
mr.
thomas
signed
the
u4,
which
contains
the
express
arbitration
agreement
upon
which
our
position
is
based.
in
may
of
1984,
a
dispute
arose
between
thomas
and
his
colleague,
mr.
johnston,
kidder
peabody,
his
employer,
and
barclay
perry,
the
manager
of
the
los
angeles
office
of
kidder
peabody.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
that
is
found--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--no,
your
honor.
it
reads--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--that
is
page
33a.
now,
the
form
of
the
u4
has
varied
over
the
years.
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
only
an
incorporation
by
reference.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
this
particular
one
says,
"i
agree
to
arbitrate
any
dispute,
claim,
or
controversy
that
may
arise
between
me
and
my
firm
or
a
customer
or
any
other
person
that
is
required
to
be
arbitrated
under
the
rules,
constitutions,
or
bylaws
of
the
organizations
with
which
i
register
as
indicated
in
question
8.
"
one
of
those
organizations
is
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
well,
the
reference
is
only
as
to
the
ambit
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
that
is
to
say,
whether
he
agrees
to
arbitrate
wage
disputes
or
working
conditions
or
the
dress
that
he
has
to
wear
to
the
office
or
things
of
that
sort.
but
there
is
an
express
agreement
to
arbitrate
controversies
with
his
employer
and
with
any
other
person,
which
would
include
perry
and
johnston,
and
that
language
does
not
appear
in
other
versions,
earlier
versions
of
the
u4.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
and
i
might
say
there
is
no
issue
but
that
he
signed
it.
apart
from
the
fact
that
his
signature
was
notarized,
his
declaration,
which
is
in
the
record,
says
that...
does
not
say
he
didn't
sign
it.
it
doesn't
even
say
he
didn't
read
it.
it
simply
says
that
no
one
apprised
him
of
the
significance
of
it.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
that's
correct,
and
their
standing
in
that
situation
had
been
established
12
years
ago
in
berman
versus
dean
witter
reynolds
in
the
state
courts
of
california,
and
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
1986
in
the
latitzia
decision.
it
would
have
no
meaning
if
they
enter
into
an
arbitration
agreement
with
a
corporation
that
can
act
only
by
its
employees,
officers,
and
directors,
and
then
assert
a
claim
against
them
individually
and
avoid
the
arbitration.
that
issue
has
been
raised
and
decided,
as
i
say,
in
our
own
state
more
than
12
years
ago
in
the
berman
decision
of
1975.
the
ninth
circuit
decided
it
in
1986,
also
involving
a
registered
representative--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--in--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--that's
correct,
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
because
mr.
thomas
contested
that.
he
did
not
do
so
in
the
trial
court,
and
therefore
that
issue
was
waived
by
the
time
he
got
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
exactly.
in
fact,
barclay
perry
also
signed
a
u4
in
his
capacity
as
manager
of
the
los
angeles
office
of
kidder
peabody.
johnston
was
also
employed
as
an
account
executive.
they
were
colleagues.
the
relationship
between
johnston
and
thomas
was
one
of
a
commission-sharing
sort,
and
the
dispute
has
to
do
with
which
of
them
was
entitled
to
commissions
that
were
derived
from
the
sale
of
securities
owned
by
a
particular
customer
who
in
the
complaint
mr.
thomas
alleges
he
introduced
to
the
firm,
and
therein
lies
the
dispute.
of
course,
those
commissions
are
payable
by
the
firm,
and
we
will
get
to
that
a
little
bit
later
as
to
who
the
employer
is
and
whether
or
not
either
perry
or
johnston
ought
to
be
involved
in
the
labor
code
dispute
in
the
first
place.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
i
don't
think
the
first
question
was
ever
raised
or
is
a
problem
in
this
case.
the
extension
of
the
california
labor
code,
of
course,
is
the
centerpiece
of
this
appeal,
and
i
must
say
that
229
of
the
labor
code,
if
read
reasonably,
will
not
conflict
with
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
it
will
not
raise
the
concerns
that
i
know
members
of
this
court
have
previously
articulated
when
you
extend
the
federal
arbitration
act
such
as
to
overrule
state
regulatory
policies.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
well,
the
california
court
of
appeals
squarely
based
its
decision
on
ware
and
says
so.
and
one
of
the
most
curious
things
about
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
only
four
pages,
found
in
the
appendix
at,
i
believe,
page
136,
it
makes
no
mention
whatsoever
of
southland.
now,
we
started
relying
on
southland
in
the
very
first
set
of
papers
we
filed
in
the
superior
court.
the
original
petition
to
compel
arbitration
and
the
motion
for
an
order
staying
proceedings
were
based
on
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
memorandum
of
points
and
authorities
supporting
that
motion
and
petition
expressly
set
forth,
quoted,
and
cited
both
southland
and
moses
cohn,
so
it
isn't
as
if
the
state
courts
of
california
were
not
aware
of
it.
indeed,
i
cannot
explain
to
you
why
it
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
simply
ignored
both
moses
cohn
and
southland
as
well
as
its
companion
decision
of
a
sister
court,
of
the
fourth
district
court
of
appeals
in
tenneti
versus
shirley.
the
complaint
was
filed
in
january,
1985,
and
the
complaint
is
worthy
of
examination
because
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
will
respond
somewhat
to
your
question
as
to
the
reach
of
229
of
the
california
labor
code.
the
complaint
cites...
is
a
form
complaint
which
we
are
now
using
in
california
on
an
optional
basis
where
you
check
the
boxes
and
then
put
in
some
additional
narrative
statements.
it
is
without
question
that
it
asserts
only
common
law
claims
for
conversion,
for
conspiracy
to
commit
conversion,
for
the
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty,
for
breach
of
contract,
and
for
a
claim
for
exemplary
and
punitive
damages.
now,
judge
o'brien
referred
to
these
other
claims
as
ancillary
to
the
wage
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
describes
them
in
terms
of
other
theories,
but
there
is
a
little
bit
more
to
it
than
that.
the
breach
of
contract...
we
are
talking
about
$40,000
in
commissions
claimed,
sought
damages
only
in
the
amount
of
$40,000.
the
conversion,
conspiracy,
and
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
claims,
however,
seek
$150,000,
and
as
is
not
surprising,
the
exemplary
and
punitive
damage
claim
seeks
$1.5
million,
something
that
i
believe
is
well
beyond
the
reasonable
ambit
of
either
ancillary
claims
or
simply
different
theories.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
because
229
by
its
very
words
is
limited
to
actions
provided
in
article
1.
but
the
california
court
of
appeals
held
otherwise,
didn't
it?
no,
the
california
court
of
appeals
simply
said
that
this
court
held
otherwise
in
the
1973
decision
in
ware,
and
based
its
decision
squarely
on
ware.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
yes.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
but
you
did.
you
did
deal
with
it
in
1973
when
you
made
the
ware
decision,
and
that
is
the
problem.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
well,
i
regret
to
say,
your
honor,
that
229
had
not
previously
been
construed
before
the
ware
decision
came
down
from
this
court
in
1973.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
on
ware?
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
absolutely.
i
mean,
mr.
thomas's
case
depends
entirely
on
that,
because
without
that
statute
then
he
has
no
shield
of
arbitration.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
no,
my
position--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--no,
i
could
simply
say--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--that
no
matter
how
you
construe
it--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--i
think
i
have
said
it.
i
think
i
have
said
it,
that
no
matter
how
you
construe
it
it
is
still
in
violation
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
but
i
don't
think
you
need
to
go
that
far.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
i
appreciate
that,
except
that--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--i
have
a
bit
of
a
dilemma
which
i
will
explain
to
you
on
that
point.
we
have
a
california
rule
of
court,
977,
which
prohibits
us
from
citing
or
relying
upon
unpublished
opinions
in
other
cases.
our
courts
of
appeals
have
made
a
regular
practice
of
issuing
unpublished
opinions.
the
issue
that
is
being
raised
right
now
was
addressed
in
an
opinion
by
the
california
court
of
appeals
in
january
of
this
year
in
a
case
involving
shearson
lehman/american
express.
unfortunately,
it
is
an
unpublished
opinion.
it
in
fact
does
distinguish
and
construe
229
in
the
fashion
that
we
would
suggest,
and
i
only
raise
the
construction
question
in
anticipating
the
concern
of
the
court
for
aligning
the
federal
arbitration
act
with
legitimate
state
policies,
and
the
reason
i
make
reference
to
the
complaint
is
not--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--no.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
i
do
not
want
to
say
it.
i
don't
believe
i
have
said
it.
and
i
don't
believe
that
anything
in
the
record
should
suggest
it
will.
all
i
am
saying
is,
your
honor,
is
that
the
california
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
made
no
attempt
itself
as
a
california
court
to
construe
229.
it
simply
accepted--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--i
understand.
i
don't
mean
to
get
off
on
a
tangent.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
well,
the
reason
i
raised
it
is
with
respect
to
the
complaint.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
if
the
complaint
does
not
allege
claims
under
article
1
of
the
labor
code,
then
229
simply
doesn't
apply,
no
matter
how
you
construe
it.
it
simply
doesn't
apply
by
its
own
terms.
the
complaint
also
alleges
that
at
all
times
herein
material
the
defendant,
referring
to
perry
and
johnston,
were
acting
in
the
course
and
scope
of
their
employment
for
defendant
kidder
peabody.
the
answer
was
filed
by
the
appellants
on
the
13th
of
february.
a
written
demand
was
sent
the
same
day
for
arbitration.
the
answer
was
a
short
form
general
denial
answer
which
asserted
as
an
affirmative
defense
the
entitlement
to
arbitration.
on
the
19th
of
february,
and
this
becomes
important
in
the
scheme
of
things
as
to
why
we
split
between
kidder
peabody
and
the
two
individuals
in
going
to
state
and
federal
court,
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
initial
decision
in
the
other
case
that
i
referred
to,
tenneti
versus
shirley.
in
that
case
they
ruled
against
kidder
peabody
and
shirley,
who
was
the
manager
of
its
newport
beach
office,
and
did
not
allow
arbitration
of
their
claims.
we
petitioned
for
rehearing.
the
rehearing
order
was
granted,
and
ultimately
the
tenneti
case
went
the
other
way.
the
motion
for
order
staying
proceedings
and
the
arbitration
petition
were
both
filed
on
the
22nd
of
february.
a
separate
petition
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
on
behalf
of
kidder
peabody.
the
order
granting
the
rehearing
in
tenneti
came
down
on
the
21st
of
march,
a
little
less
than
a
month
later.
the
hearing
was
conducted
by
judge
o'brien
in
the
superior
court
on
the
5th
of
april
of
'85.
he
issued
his
minute
order
on
the
10th
of
april
of
'85.
we
requested
a
statement
of
decision.
we
got
one.
on
the
25th
of
april,
1985,
judge
kelleher
in
the
district
court,
based
on
judge
o'brien's
decision,
dismissed
kidder
peabody's
petition.
we
then
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
of
judge
o'brien's
decision.
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
october
of
1985
the
second
tenneti
opinion
came
down.
that
opinion
is
very
important
because
it
upholds
the
supremacy
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
california
in
these
arbitration
questions.
it
did
not
do
so
in
the
earlier
version
that
came
down
in
february
of
1985.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
we
are
appealing
here
was
issued
on
the
10th
of
april,
and
as
i
indicated
is
very
short,
and
makes
no
mention
whatsoever
of
southland
or
moses
cohn.
it
doesn't
attempt
to
distinguish
it
or
explain
it.
it
simply
makes
no
mention
of
it.
it
says
in
so
many
words
that
its
decision
is
based
squarely
on
ware.
it
rejected
the
severance
of
claims
after
noting
our
citation
to
dean
witter
reynolds
versus
byrd
and
made
no
mention
whatsoever
of
tenneti.
as
i
previously
indicated,
perry
and
johnston
are
beneficiaries
to
the
agreement
by
virtue
of
the
well-established
case
law,
and
that
frankly
was
not
challenged
in
the
trial
court
and
is
not
on
appeal
here.
it
is
our
position
that
southland,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
january,
1984,
is
the
controlling
authority
in
this
case,
not
ware,
and
that
position
is
simply
based
on
the
fact
that
our
petition
does
not
contend
and
has
never
contended
that
229
of
the
california
labor
code
is
preempted
by
rule
347
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
that
was
the
position
in
ware.
rather,
our
position
is
that
there
is
little
difference
between
california
labor
code
section
229
and
california
corporations
code
section
31512,
which
this
court
held
was
preempted
by
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
the
southland
decision.
ware
did
not
decide
the
preemption
question
from
the
standpoint
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
indeed,
the
california
supreme
court
in
its
decision
in
keating
made
that
determination.
it
may
well
be
a
gratuitous
observation
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
but
it
certainly
was
not
insofar
as
the
california
court
of
appeals
was
concerned.
there
was
no
attempt
by
the
california
court
of
appeals
to
distinguish
southland
because
it
didn't
even
mention
it,
and
it
was
briefed
to
it
fairly
well
and
it
was
just
left
alone.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
no,
the
position
is,
the
berman
case
says
that
nonsignatories--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--berman
versus
dean
witter
reynolds
is
the
1975
california
court
of
appeals
case.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
that's
correct,
and
it
was
an
agreement
of
this
very
kind.
it
was
the
same
kind
of
agreement.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
i
would
differ
with
that.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
well,
that
is
where
i
think
that...
that
assumption
is
made
but
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
no.
see,
the
california
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
which
is
found
at
139
et
sec
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
quotes
in
a
curious
fashion
in
footnote
2
at
the
bottom
of
page
140
labor
code
229.
it
says
labor
code
section
229
states
in
pertinent
part,
"actions.
"
"for
the
collection
of
due
and
unpaid
wages
claimed
by
an
individual
may
be
maintained
without
regard
to
the
existence
of
any
private
agreement.
"
well,
let
me
tell
you
what
the
ellipses
provides.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
well,
i
think
this
court
should.
again
we
are
getting
drawn
into
the
construction
question,
but
whether
or
not
it
applies
or
whether
you
should
concern
yourself
with
it,
it
says
"the
actions
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
this
article.
"
"the
provisions
of
this
article".
in
other
words,
this
is
not
a
general
statute
that
says
any
arbitration
agreement
in
respect
of
wages
is
unenforceable
in
california.
the
article
is
very
precise
in
the
kinds
of
actions
that
are
authorized.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
no,
the
arbitration
agreement
itself
is
not
otherwise
unenforceable.
it
is
simply
as
it
relates
to
the
wage
claim
on
the--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--well,
therein
lies
the
problem.
see,
the
complaint
does
not
allege
a
labor
code
wage
claim,
but
it
alleges
a
lot
of
these
common
law
torts
which
would
not
otherwise
be
exempted
from
the
arbitration
agreement
even
if
the
229
analysis
you
just
made
were
to
apply.
that
is
our
problem.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
no,
but
california
case
law
has
unequivocally
held
that
torts
are
subject
to
arbitration.
the
problem
we
have...
the
problem
is
very
similar
to
that
in
byrd.
in
byrd
you
were
concerned
with
the
arbitrability
of
a
'34
act
claim
and
how
that
intertwined
with
the
state
law
pendent
claims
in
the
district
court
in
the
byrd
case.
at
that
point--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--no.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
well,
the
case
in
controversy
existed
well
before
we
ever
got
to
the
california
decision.
as
soon
as
they
were
made
involuntary
defendants
in
the
complaint
they
were
involved
in
a
case
in
controversy.
they
then
sought
to
enforce
the
arbitration
provision
and
have
that
resolved
elsewhere.
so
i
think
we
pass
muster
under
article
3
without
any
question
at
all.
an
analysis
of
the
labor
code
sections
i
mentioned
would
indicate
that
there
are
a
number
of
other
provisions
that
are
enforceable
only
by
the
state,
and
some
only
in
the
name
of
the
state,
and
some
of
the
penalties
that
are
recoverable
can
only
be
recovered
and
paid
to
the
state,
and
actions
can
only
be
brought
in
the
name
of
the
labor
commission,
so
229
in
my
view
applies
to
those
actions
and
not
to
private
litigants.
it
also
talks
about
the
labor
commissioner's
hearings
that
are
held
under
labor
code
section
206,
another
action
which
we
do
not
contend
would
be
frustrated
by
the
court
reversing
the
court
of
appeals.
we
don't
contend
that
forcing
mr
thomas
to
arbitrate
his
common
law
claims
against
perry
and
johnston
should
in
any
way
be
regarded
as
undercutting
the
california
labor
commissioner's
statutory
authority
to
inquire
into
the
wage
disputes
and
to
conduct
hearings
and
to
make
awards
as
appropriate.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
to
respond.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
that's
right.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
the
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
in
berman
versus
dean
witter
reynolds.
and
the
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
latitzia
versus
prudential
bache.
those
are
the
authorities
that
we
rely
on
to
extend
this
particular
agreement
to
include
the
nonsignatories,
perry
and
johnston.
for
the
sake
of
your
eyesight,
justice
scalia,
that
language
is
reproduced
on
page
21a,
which
we
put
it
into
our
original
papers.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
unfortunately,
when
they
took
a
picture
of
this
to
reduce
it
for
the
size
of
the
brief,
it
got
a
lot
smaller.
but
you
will
find
in
the
middle
of
that--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--or
specifically
whether
or
not
johnston
and
perry
are
the
beneficiaries
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
yes.
i
wonder
if
i
can
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
to
rebut.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
very
briefly,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
points
raised
by
mr.
gelber.
i
am
pleased
that
his
reliance
on
ware
has
shrunk
from
100
percent,
where
it
was
two
years
ago,
now
down
to
80
percent,
but
i
still
don't
think
that
that
is
the
appropriate
controlling
authority.
southland
clearly
is,
and
it
fails
unfortunately
to
this
court
to
tell
the
california
court
of
appeals
that
it
is,
and
it
made
no
attempt
to
deal
with
it
itself,
and
regrettably
that
is
what
brings
us
here.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
last
wage
claim
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
egregious
to
contemplate
that
a
wage
claim
would
be
resolved
by
arbitration
or
by
any
other
mechanism
other
than
judicial
proceeding.
the
very
article
i
that
229
refers
to
includes
section
206,
which
specifically
talks
about
a
labor
commissioner
mechanism
for
the
recovery
of
wage
claims,
which
is
indeed
the
most
common
way
that
wage
claims
are
asserted
in
california.
the
method
is
that
the
employee
goes
down
to
the
labor
commissioner,
makes
an
assignment
of
the
wage
claim,
fills
out
a
form.
the
labor
commissioner
conducts
a
hearing
within
ten
days,
according
to
the
statute,
issues
a
ruling.
you
either...
the
employer
either
pays
the
wage
claim
at
that
point
in
time
or
can
seek
judicial
review,
so
the
state
of
california
itself
has
provided
an
alternative
mechanism
for
mr.
thomas
to
recover
the
contended
wages
without
resorting
to
the
courts
and
without
regard
to
an
arbitration
agreement.
now,
our
position,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
is
not
that--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--because
that
is
the
authority
of
the
state.
my--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
preempt
206.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
well,
that...
our
view
of
the
case
is
that
this
is
not
essentially
a
wage
claim,
and
the
claims
that
occur
in
the
case
are
not.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
if
it
is
a
wage
claim--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--well,
or
we
could
raise,
perhaps,
the
arbitration
agreement
as
a
defense
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--frankly,
your
honor,
i
haven't
focused
on
it.
we
never
have.
it
doesn't
make...
the
whole
purpose
of
arbitration--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--no.
why
do
we
want
arbitration
in
the
first
place?
we
want
arbitration
in
the
first
place
to
get
a
quick
expeditious
resolution
of
the
claim.
there
is
nothing
quicker--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--i
appreciate
those,
justice
scalia.
the
problem
is
that
i
am
now
being
put
in
the
position
of
serving
as
the
attorney
general
of
california
and
arguing--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--my
position
is
that
it
would
not
prevent
the
labor
commissioner
from
making
the
inquiry.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
well,
i
am
trying
to
parse
out
the
role
of
the
state
agency
under
the
legislation.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
because
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
the
private
litigant,
mr.
thomas,
would
be
bound
by
the
arbitration
agreement,
and
we
could
contend
that
his
claim
presented
to
the
labor
commissioner
was
barred
by
the
arbitration
agreement
and
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
i
suppose
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
but,
having
said
that--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--having
said
that,
i
am
not
saying
that
the
labor
commissioner
is
precluded
from
undertaking
his
statutory
investigation
with
respect
to
all
of
the
things
covered
in
article
1,
and
therein
lies
the
difference
in
applying
229.
229
talks
about
the
powers
to
enforce
the
provision.
217
gives
enforcement
powers
to
a
state
agency,
not
the--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--no,
among
other
things
the
labor
commissioner
can
do
is
bring
an
action
in
the
name
of
the
state
of
california
for
a
penalty.
let's
assume
under
your
scenario
that
the
wages
were
owed
to
mr.
thomas
and
we
resisted
mr.
thomas's
assignment
to
the
labor
commissioner
under
the
arbitration
agreement,
and
we
said,
i
am
sorry
but
the
federal
arbitration
act
governs,
and
to
the
extent
that
206
is
inconsistent,
you,
mr.
thomas,
may
not
proceed.
fine.
now
the
labor
commissioner
says
that
is
fine
with
mr.
thomas.
he
doesn't
have
a
civil
remedy,
if
you
will,
but
i
as
the
labor
commissioner
of
california
am
not
precluded
from
carrying
out
because
of
his
arbitration
agreement
my
statutory
mandate,
which
include,
among
other
things,
suing
for
a
civil
penalty
payable
only
to
the
state
of
california.
my
position
is
that
that
is
what
229
is
talking
about,
that
the
state
agencies
are
not
inhibited
by
a
private
arbitration
agreement
between
thomas
and
kidder
peabody,
with
thomas
and
perry,
or
anybody
else,
and
we
don't
contend
they
were,
and
no
one
ever
has
said
that.
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
no,
the
penalty
is
payable
to
the
state
of
california--
mr.
peter
brown
dolan
--expressly
provided
in
the
statute
that
the
action
is
brought
in
the
name
of
the
labor
commissioner
and
payable
to
the
state
of
california.
