justice
stevens
and
your
clients
here
claim
to
be
third
party
beneficiaries
to
that
agreement.
is
that
it?
justice
stevens
but
the
court
just
assumed
it
in
this
case.
it
didn't
really
decide
it,
did
it?
justice
stevens
this
particular
litigation.
they
didn't...
they
just
assumed
there
was
standing.
they
didn't
really...
didn't
they
say
in
a
footnote
they
assume
it
without
reaching
the
question?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
were
these...
were
your
clients
employed
by
the
same
employer
at
the
time
he
signed
this
contract?
justice
stevens
mr.
dolan,
before
you...
can
i
go
back
to
standing
for
just
a
second?
i
believe
you
answered
me
earlier
by
quoting
this
provision
of
the
agreement,
the
third
party
beneficiary
agreement,
as
a
matter
of
california
law
they
are
third
party
beneficiaries
of
the
contract
and
therefore
have
standing.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
stevens
which
is
the
berman
case?
justice
stevens
as
a
matter
of
california
law
nonsignatories
may
enforce
an
agreement
of
this
kind
as
third
party
beneficiaries?
justice
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
as
a
matter
of
california
law
insofar
as
this
agreement
provides
for
the
recovery
of
wages,
it
is
unenforceable...
it
is
not
unenforceable,
just
unenforceable
in
arbitration?
that's
what
it
is.
justice
stevens
in
fact
it
is...
no,
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
is
unenforceable
as
a
matter
of
california
law.
justice
stevens
isn't
that
what
229
says?
justice
stevens
whatever
it
provides,
apparently
the
author
of
the
opinion
didn't
think
the
ellipses
were
very
important.
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you...
put
my
question
this
way.
if
we
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
assuming
that
229
made
this
agreement
to
arbitrate
unenforceable
as
a
matter
of
california
law
then
would
it
not
be
correct
that
your
basis
for
standing
as
third
party
beneficiaries
relies
on
a
contractual
provision
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
is
unenforceable?
justice
stevens
well,
insofar
as
it
has
relevance
to
this
litigation,
which
i
take
it
from
the
california
opinion
is
assumed
to
be
a
wage
claim
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
the
common
law
torts
and
the
like
aren't
covered
by
the
arbitration
act.
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
it
was
a
question
of
standing
in
that
case,
was
it?
justice
stevens
all
of
my
inquiry
is
not
directed
to
the
merits,
but
merely
as
to
whether
there
is
standing
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
which
as
i
understand
it
you
rely
for...
the
predicate
for
your
whole
standing
argument
is
a
california
rule
of
law
which
makes
this
contract
unenforceable
insofar
as
it
relates
to
this
controversy.
justice
stevens
you
said
without
regard
to
the
arbitration
agreement,
why
wouldn't
that
procedure
be
preempted,
too?
justice
stevens
no,
but
under
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
it
seems
to
me
it
would
preempt
that
procedure
if
the
wage
earner
had
signed
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
justice
stevens
would
preempt
the
california
procedure
you
just
described.
he
couldn't
use
that
procedure,
could
he,
under
your
view
of
the
case?
justice
stevens
if
it
is
a
wage
claim.
justice
stevens
in
your
view
could
your
opponent
use
the
california
procedure
you
have
just
described?
justice
stevens
i
am
asking
you
whether
that
would
be
a
good
defense
in
such
a
proceeding.
what
is
your
view?
justice
stevens
the
answer
is,
you
don't
know.
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
stevens
i
don't
care
why
you
want
it.
i
am
asking
you
whether
in
your
view
of
the
case
if
you
objected
to
using
the
statutory
procedure
that
you
just
described,
you
think
you
should
prevail
or
not.
i
think
there
are
only
four
answers:
yes,
no,
i
don't
know,
or
i
won't
say.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
stevens
no,
you
are
telling
me
what
your
view
of
the
issue
you
have
asked
us
to
decide
is.
what
is
the
extent
of
the
preemption
that
flows
from
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act?
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
that
is
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stevens
does
it
have
the
power
to
decide
the
issue
in
the
face
of
an
objection
that
the
federal
statute
has
preempted
this
particular
procedure?
justice
stevens
yes,
and
that
is
what
you
are
arguing.
you
have
preempted
the
procedure
in
state
court,
and
now
you
have
just
said,
well,
there
is
another
state
procedure
they
should
have
taken,
and
i
don't
see
how
they
could
have
taken
that
if
you
are
right
on
your
principal
submission.
justice
stevens
i
know
you
could
contend
that.
i
keep
asking
you,
should
you
in
your
view
of
the
case
prevail
when
you
make
that
contention?
i
think
you
are
saying
i
don't
know.
justice
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
then
it
isn't
available
to
them.
justice
stevens
in
other
words
you
say
he
has
got
to
investigate
but
he
couldn't
make
a
decision.
why
can't
the
trial
judge
here
conduct
a
lot
of
discovery
and
say
i
think
this
is
the
way
it
looks
but
i
can't
decide
it?
justice
stevens
but
it
would
be
okay
for
them
to
collect
a
penalty,
so
is
his
punitive
damage
claim
then
not
preempted?
justice
stevens
i
see.
