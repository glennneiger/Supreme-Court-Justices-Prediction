chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
86-566,
barclay
perry
and
james
johnston
versus
kenneth
morgan
thomas.
mr.
dolan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
standing
issue
really
turns
on
state
laws,
doesn't
it,
how
far...
what
the
extent
of
the
contract
between
the
two
of
you
is,
and
how
far
the
cal
labor
code
extends?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
california
court
of
appeals
here
unreasonably,
i
guess,
in
your
view,
read
it
so
it
did
conflict.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
does
this
line
of
argument
bear
on
the
question
presented
here,
whether
229
is
preempted
by
the
arbitration
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
interpretation
that
the
california
court
of
appeals
made
of
section
229
in
this
case,
wherever
it
got
it
from,
is
wrong?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
a
question
we
just
don't
deal
with
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
would
assume
that
the
ware
decision
took
california
law
as
it
came
from
the
california
courts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
question
that
you
just
answered
for
justice
scalia
is
a
question
of
california
contract
law,
i
take
it,
whether
this
particular
agreement
embraces
a
particular
situation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
gelber.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
treatment
of
ware...
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
ware
may
suggest
that
the
moses
cohn
decision
and
the
southland
decision
were
somewhat
unforeseeable,
but
i
think
you
have
a
hard
time
saying
that...
reading
the
ware
opinion
in
saying
that
that
court
viewed
the
federal
arbitration
act
the
same
way
the
court
viewed
it
in
southland.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
it
was
rediscovered
in
southland.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
is
one
thing
for
the
court
to
say
that,
as
it
did,
i
believe,
in
ware,
that
california
was
entitled
to
reconcile
its
section
229
in
its
state
arbitration
act
in
a
particular
way
and
this
court
would
accept
it,
but
it
is
another
thing
to
say
that
the
same
reconciliation
would
have
to
take
place
between
the
federal
act
and
the
california
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
gelber,
what
do
you
mean
by
the
issue
of
standing
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
party
has
to
have
a
contractual
right
to
compel
arbitration?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
where
do
we
look
for
a
determination
of
that
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
is
a
matter
of
california
law,
isn't
it?
it
is
a
contract
executed
in
california.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we
don't
have
any
independent
law
of
contracts
here,
since
erie
railroad
against
tompkins,
it
is
up
to
california
to
decide
what
a
california
contact
means.
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
certainly
did
by
implication.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gelber.
mr.
dolan,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dolan.
the
case
is
submitted.
