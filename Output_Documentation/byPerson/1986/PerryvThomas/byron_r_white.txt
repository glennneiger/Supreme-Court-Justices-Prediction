there
was
an
express
provision
for
arbitration?
justice
white
in
his
employment
contract?
justice
white
it
wasn't
just
a
reference
to
new
york
stock
exchange
rules
or
anything
like
that?
justice
white
well,
that
is
all
i
really
need.
justice
white
but
this
is
express?
justice
white
well,
that
is
by
reference.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
but
your
case
doesn't
depend
on
that,
does
it?
justice
white
no,
on
the
construction
of
the
california
statute.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
you...
how
about
your
case?
justice
white
that
is
what
i
am
asking
you.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
you
are
bound
to
get
around
to
saying
that.

exactly.
justice
white
you
can't
win...
you
can't
win...
you
can't
win
except
on
this
argument
that
that
law
is
preempted,
because
as
a
case
comes
to
us,
we
reach
that
law
as
a
given.
justice
white
if
you
want
to
say
you
lose
if
ware's
construction
of
this
section
is
correct--
justice
white
--you
don't
want
to
say
that,
do
you?
justice
white
well,
i
am
not
going
to
spend
a
lot
of
my
time
in
deciding
this
case
on
what
the
construction
of
229
is.
justice
white
well,
you
have
been.
justice
white
and
you
are
still
on
a
tangent.
justice
white
xxx
particular
argument
if
the
promise
to
arbitrate
here
made
no
reference
whatsoever
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
rules,
but
the
arbitration
provision
said,
i
agree
to
arbitrate,
and
then
they
listed
all
the
agreements,
all
the
kinds
of
disputes
that
were
to
be
arbitrated,
and
that
this
case
involved
one
of
those
listed.
would
you
be
making
this
argument?
justice
white
no,
just
whatever...
it
involved
the
very
dispute
that
is
here,
which
is
for
what?
the
dispute
is
over
what
here?
justice
white
all
right.
let's
assume
that
that
kind
of
a
dispute
is
one
of
the
disputes
that
was
listed,
expressly
listed
in
the
contract
to
be
arbitrated.
justice
white
all
right,
but
you
couldn't
be
making
an
argument
based
on
congressional
intent
not
to
preempt
in
the
securities
laws.
then
you
would
have
to
face
up
squarely
to
the
federal
arbitration
act.
justice
white
but
this
promise
to
arbitrate
that
was
written
in
the
contract
does
on
its
face
and
under
california
law
refer
to
disputes
with
co-employees.
justice
white
i
know,
but
it
incorporates
by
reference
just
the
kind
of
disputes.
justice
white
the
kind,
the
type
of...
the
description
of
the
arbitrable
disputes
in
the
rules,
the
stock
exchange
rules.
justice
white
but
your
position
renders
with
any
other
person
just...
in
the
contract
just
makes
it
surplusage.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
think
the
reference
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
rules
could
certainly
mean
that
just
referring
to
the
types
of
disputes
that
would
be
arbitrable.
justice
white
that
is
a
different
point.
