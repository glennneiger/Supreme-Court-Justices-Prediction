mr.
bruce
gelber
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court,
there
are
certain
rights
which
are
sacred
and
fundamental
in
the
law,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
1973
in
its
unanimous
decision
in
ware,
foremost
amongst
those
is
a
wage
earner's
rights
to
the
fruits
of
his
labor,
not
to
just
part
of
the
fruits
of
his
labor,
but
to
all
of
the
fruits
of
his
labor.
now,
in
enacting
labor
code
section
229,
the
california
legislature
in
its
wisdom
felt
that
arbitration
was
less
than
an
adequate
remedy
for
redressing
disputes
over
wages,
and
when
this
matter
came
before
this
court
in
1973,
all
eight
justices
who
participated
saw
clearly
that
california
had
a
historical
constitutional
prerogative
to
protect
its
wage
earners
in
this
matter.
now,
our
case
is
based
first
on
ware.
we
have
discussed
ware,
whether
or
not
it
is
on
all
fours
and
completely
applicable.
i
like
to
think
of
ware
as
being
80
percent
on
point.
we
are
dealing
with
a
wage
earner
who
has
brought
a
civil
action
to
recover
his
wages.
the
employer
and
co-employees
who
have
defended
on
the
case
have
raised
that
form
u4,
claiming
that
he
has
agreed
to
arbitrate
any
dispute
that
may
arise.
mr.
bruce
gelber
that
i
think
you
foresaw
that
that
is
the
20
percent--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--that
may
be
in
dispute,
but
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
first,
as
the
court
here
found
in
byrd,
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
so
that
whether
merrill
lynch
back
in
the
days
of
ware
relied
on
the
federal
arbitration
act
or
the
state
arbitration
act
in
bringing
its
motion
to
compel
arbitration
should
make
no
cognizable
difference.
mr.
bruce
gelber
well,
it
would--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
was
fully
mindful
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
as
it
cited
it
at
footnote
15
of
the
ware
decision,
and
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
the
ware
case
would
have
turned
on
whether
or
not
the
attorneys
for
merrill
lynch
were
perceptive
enough
to
raise
the
federal
arbitration
act
instead
of
just
the
state
arbitration
act.
mr.
bruce
gelber
well,
the
federal
arbitration
act,
mr.
chief
justice,
has
been
in
effect
long
before
ware,
and
any
impact
it
would
have
would
have
been
fully
available
to
this
court.
mr.
bruce
gelber
well,
as
things
get
rediscovered,
the
legislative
intent
does
not
change
with
the
passage
of
time.
in
southland,
we
have
a
very
interesting
dissent
that
you
joined
in
which
you
felt
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
didn't
even
apply
to
a
state
action
such
as
this,
and
perhaps
that
should
be
reconsidered.
mr.
bruce
gelber
but,
justice
o'connor,
it
was
a
very
perceptive
opinion.
mr.
bruce
gelber
i
felt
that
perhaps
you
could
persuade
your
brethren
on
the
bench.
mr.
bruce
gelber
i
say
to
the
majority--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--i
say
to
the
majority
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
commercial
dispute,
perhaps
that
is
appropriate
for
arbitration,
but
if
we
look
at
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
there
is
a
savings
clause
which
says
that
certain
disputes
are
not
going
to
be
arbitrated
where
they
fall
within
a
matter
of
law
or
equity
and
are
revocable
on
those
grounds.
now,
the
question
is,
do
the
states
have
a
right
to
establish
those
perimeters?
now,
i
am
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
byrd
and
southland
you
have
indicated,
that
is,
the
court
has
indicated
that
the
states
are
denied
the
right
to
carve
out
exceptions
to
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
therefore
it
fails
upon
this
court
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
to
carve
out
those
exceptions
to
the
federal
arbitration
act
that
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
the
savings
clause
in
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
now,
while
ware
may
not
be
directly
on
point
because
of
merrill
lynch's
use
of
the
state
arbitration
act
rather
than
the
federal
arbitration
act,
nevertheless
the
policy
language
which
is
throughout
ware
points
out
the
fact
that
there
are
certain
circumstances
in
which
an
arbitration
act
used
by
an
employer
in
advance
of
an
employee's
dispute
can
have
an
undesirable
economic
effect,
and
i
feel
that
that
is
just
as
applicable
today
as
it
was
when
the
court
reviewed
ware
back
in
1973.
mr.
bruce
gelber
your
honor,
that
would
presuppose
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
policy
between
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
after
all,
when
you
decided
the
case
in
ware,
the
first
point
that
you
raised
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
issue
of
preemption.
preemption
was
the
federal
act,
securities
act
versus
labor
code
section
229,
and
it
is
the
same
analysis
that
applies
in
this
case.
we
are
dealing
with
the
preemption
model.
that
is,
is
the
federal
act,
the
federal
arbitration
act
inconsistent
with
labor
code
section
229
or
do
the
states
have
that
constitutional
prerogative
to
create
certain
exceptions
for
the
benefit
of
its
wage
earners?
mr.
bruce
gelber
if
it
involved
one
other
than
for
wages?
mr.
bruce
gelber
the
dispute
is
over
wages
and
different
theories
for
recovering
wages
and
different
remedies
for
the--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
make
the
same
argument
because
it
violates
public
policy.
mr.
bruce
gelber
your
honor,
we
believe
that
there
is
a
federal
common
law
that
would
protect
the
wage
earner
on
this
case
and
that
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
says
that
there
are
exceptions.
it
does
not
define
what
the
exceptions
are--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--i
am
sorry.
mr.
bruce
gelber
your
honor,
i
believe
the
policies
are
the
same
or
similar
as
they
relate
to
the
two.
after
all,
the
federal
arbitration
act
basically
abrogates
the
common
law
hostility
towards
enforcing
arbitration
agreements.
the
securities
exchange
provisions
do
not
differ
greatly.
the
policy
is
fairly
similar,
and
appellants
have
certainly
not
shown
us
how
the
policy
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
was
in
full
force
and
effect
at
the
time
of
ware,
is
any
different
than
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
now,
if
i
may
address
some
issues
that
the
court
raised
during
my
opponent's
presentation,
we
have
in
regard
to
standing
two
points
i
wish
to
make.
first,
the
issue
of
standing
was
raised
at
the
trial
level
before
the
california
superior
court
and,
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
pages
78a
and
120a
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
bruce
gelber
what
i
mean
by
the
issue
of
standing
is
that
where
we
have
a
controversy
over
the
right
to
compel
arbitration,
the
party
compelling
arbitration
has
to
have
some
vested
interest
or
vested
right
such
as
a
third
party
beneficiary
right
to
raise--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--correct.
mr.
bruce
gelber
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
we
did
raise
that
at
the
trial
level
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
on
that
point.
now,
moving
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
if
we
just
construe
the
agreements
that
we
have
here
we
look
first
to
form
u4.
mr.
bruce
gelber
right,
but
i
believe
the
interpretation
would
apply
to
this
court
sitting
in
view
of
the
agreements.
if
i
may--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--unfortunately,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
the
issue,
and--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--because
they
felt
that
it
was
not
timely
raised,
and
they
were
in
error
on
that
point,
as
i
have
pointed
out
by
reference
to
the
record
here.
but
if
i
might
just
point
out
that
the
arbitration
clause
that
mr.
thomas
signed
states
that
he
agrees
to
arbitrate
any
dispute
which
is
required
to
be
arbitrated
by
the
exchange
act
rules.
however,
rule
347
of
the
exchange
does
not
require
mr.
thomas
to
arbitrate
any
dispute
with
these
appellants.
it
only
says
that
he
must
arbitrate
a
dispute
arising
between
him
and
a
member
firm
of
the
exchange,
which
is
what
kidder
peabody
is.
now,
counsel--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--i
would
have
to
defer
on...
i
do
not
have
the
answer
for
you
as
to
what
rule
of
construction
would
apply.
i
am
simply
saying,
under
any
rule
of
construction
if
the
agreement
in
black
and
white
says
that
mr.
thomas
will
arbitrate
any
disputes
as
required
by
the
exchange,
and
the
exchange
does
not
require
him
to
arbitrate
disputes
with
co-employees,
but
only
with
a
member
firm,
then
there
is
no
language
there
requiring
him
to
arbitrate
a
dispute
with
a
co-employee.
mr.
bruce
gelber
and
berman.
let's
talk
about
berman,
because
berman
was
a
case
in
1975
where
the
stock
exchange
company
moved
to
compel
arbitration
in
the
same
proceeding
as
the
co-employees,
but
we
don't
have
that
here
because
kidder
peabody
is
not
before
this
court.
they
brought
a
separate
action
in
the
federal
district
court
which
these
co-employees
did
not
join.
mr.
bruce
gelber
well,
because
they
are
an
indispensable
party
to
the
agreement.
they
are
the
contracting
party.
it
is
through
the
contracting
party
that
these
beneficiaries
are
seeking
as
appendages
of
the
corporation
to
get
the
benefit
of
arbitration.
mr.
bruce
gelber
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
enough
to
respond,
your
honor.
but
i
was...
certainly
on
the
case
of
berman
and
the
other
cases
that
they
had
relied
in
the
court
below,
that
is,
ross
versus
mathis,
there
was
no
such
situation
where
the
corporation
goes
off
to
the
federal
court
and
runs
the
motion
up
the
federal
flagpole
and
the
co-employees
bring
the
same
motion
in
the
state
court
and
run
it
up
the
state
flagpole,
so
here
we
are
over
in
the
federal
court
with
kidder
peabody,
we
are
in
the
state
court
with
the
co-employees.
i
think
they
lack
standing--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--that's
right
but,
it
incorporates
by
reference--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--it
actually
mandates
the
arbitration--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--what
it
says
is
that
the...
mr.
thomas
need
only
arbitrate
those
disputes
which
are
required
by
the
exchange.
mr.
bruce
gelber
well,
that
is
the...
they
are
the
drafters
of
that
agreement.
mr.
bruce
gelber
well,
i
believe
the
exchange
rules
specifically
say
that
you
need
only
arbitrate
those
disputes
with
a
member
corporation
and
let
me
show
you
a
different--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--okay,
but
let
me
tell
you
how
i
think
it
would
apply
here,
justice
white.
we
have
a
situation
where
mr.
thomas
feels
sorely
aggrieved
by
not
having
received
his
wages.
as
a
side
note
you
need
not
plead
violation
of
labor
code
in
bringing
such
an
action.
you
bring
an
action
for
denial
of
your
wages.
and
so
i
think
that
counsel
has
raised
a
red
herring
in
that
regard.
now,
if
these
appellants,
these
co-employees
are
acting
in
the
course
and
scope
of
their
employment
in
the
course
of
denying
my
client
his
wages,
then
the
only
liability
is
on
the
member
corporation,
and
quite
obviously
under
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
then
there
would
be
some
application
there,
but
these
are
co-employees
who
have
taken
from
him
his
money.
they
have
allegedly
taken
his
wages,
and
for
them
to
claim
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
agreement
doesn't
follow.
now,
i
have
one
more
important
issue
that
i
wish
to
address
and
i
believe
that
this
is
perhaps
the
most
important
issue
we
have.
and
that
is,
is
that
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
appellants
are
proferring
here
are
simply
unfair.
now,
in
justice
marshall's
decision
for
the
court
in
byrd,
noted
in
footnote
2,
the
court
did
not
address
that
issue.
it
said
that
byrd
had
not
raised
the
adhesive
nature
of
the
contract
in
the
court
below
and
that
this
court
would
not
address
it.
we
feel
that
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
are
unfair
in
two
regards.
first,
the
arbitrator
who
is
going
to
sit
in
judgment
of
this
case
and
make
a
binding
decision
is
appointed
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange
of
which
appellants'
corporation
is
a
member
firm.
we
feel
that
there
is
an
institutional
bias,
and
it
is
not
simply
that
the
arbitrator
would
be
unfair.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
arbitrator
would
be
fair...
would
be
unfair,
but
as
this
court
has
noted
in
many
other
contexts,
it
simply
the
appearance
of
unfairness
that
so
offends
constitutional
notions.
if
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
was
to
use
what
we
use
in
california
such
as
retired
judges,
or
the
auspices
of
the
american
arbitration
association,
it
would
not
be
so
offensive
as
the
present
rules.
secondly,
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
do
not
allow
a
meaningful
opportunity
for
discovery.
there
is
only
one
provision
in
there
regarding
discovery,
and
that
says
that
the
parties
will
exchange
such
documents
as
will
expedite
the
proceeding.
there
is
no
judicial
review.
each
side
would
have
unfettered
control
over
which
documents
would
be
divulged
and
which
ones
would
not
be,
and
this
simply
turns
hundreds
of
years
of
judicial--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--yes,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--that
would
simply,
to
my
thinking,
that
would
simply--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--turn
the
judicial
system
on
its
head.
that
would--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--well,
your
honor,
i
could
only
draw
an
analogy,
perhaps,
to
a
different
area
that
may
raise
the
court's
suspicion.
that
would
be
if
an
individual
was
to
move
into
a,
say
a
condominium,
and
sure,
he
signs
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
any
dispute.
i
could
not
believe
that
this
court
would
say
that
there
was
a
restrictive
covenant
in
that
condominium
agreement
that
the
court
would
not
look
with
suspicion
at
the
agreement
and
say
we
don't
care
the
fact
that
these
people
agreed
to
the
things.
there
are
certain
things
that
so
offend
our
sense
of
justice
that
we
wouldn't
tolerate
it,
and
i
think
the
same
applies
here,
that
to
say
that
a...
that
a
wage
earner
must
abide
by
some
agreement
that
even
you
had
difficulty
reading,
and
it
is
not
much
larger
than
the
original,
and
that
by
doing
so
he
waives
not
just
important
constitutional
rights
to
jury
trial
and
discovery
and
the
like
but
perhaps
the
recovery
itself.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
tolerated,
and
i
don't
think
it
should
be
tolerated.
and
if
the
court
has
nothing
further--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--well,
i
believe
it
falls
upon
the
judiciary
to
fashion
the
limitations
on
the
federal
arbitration
act--
mr.
bruce
gelber
--as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
and
i
believe
in
so
fashioning
such
a
remedy
that
the
court
would
draw
upon
basic
senses
of
fairness
and
fair
play.
and
if
the
court
has
nothing
further--
