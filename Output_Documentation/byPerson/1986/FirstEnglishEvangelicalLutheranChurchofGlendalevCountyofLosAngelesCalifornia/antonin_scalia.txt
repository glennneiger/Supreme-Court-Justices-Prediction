justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
berger,
did
you
argue
to
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
in
california
that
agins
was
contrary
to
federal
law,
that
agins
was
unconstitutional
under
federal
law?
was
that
argument
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
berger,
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
that,
rather
than
implying
a
damage
remedy
directly
from
the
constitution
or
inferring
one
directly
from
the
constitution,
you
would
have
the
remedy
of
using
section
1983.
what's
wrong
with
that,
apart
from
the
fact
that
you
haven't
used
it
here,
i
mean.
if
you
knew
about
it,
why
wouldn't
that
give
you
as
satisfactory...
why
wouldn't
that
give
everybody
as
satisfactory
a
remedy
as
implying
a
direct
monetary
cause
of
action
as
the
constitution
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
supposing
it
had
been
a
federal
regulatory
taking.
would
1983--
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe
that's
why
the
solicitor
general
thinks
that
that's
better
than
applying
it
directly.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
just
said,
but
we
didn't
hold
it,
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
have
we
held
that
it's
self-executing?
justice
antonin
scalia
against
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
there's
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
court
stops
the
taking,
then
there's
no
compensation.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
california
says:
we're
not
going
to
allow
the
taking.
that's
what
the
california
court's
are
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
remedy
is
we
will
stop
that
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
berger,
suppose...
is
there
anything
that
stands
between
your
position
and
the
federal
government
having
to
pay
innumerable
people
nationwide
some
to
be
determined
amount
of
compensation
every
time
a
regulation
of
the
fcc
or
the
ftc
or
any
other
federal
agency
is
stricken
down?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
stands
between
the
position
you're
arguing
here
and
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
part
of
the
case,
mr.
white.
i
really
don't
understand
this
argument.
suppose
the
issue
in
the
case...
there
are
two
issues
in
another
case,
whether
any
holder
of
a
leasehold
interest
can
have
his
property
taken,
and
it
comes
before
a
california
court
and
the
court
says
its
ruling
is
you're
out
of
court
because
no
owners
of
leasehold
interest
can
have
any
cause
of
action.
now,
would
you
come
up
here
and
say
that
we
couldn't
dispose
of
that
case
and
we
couldn't
determine
whether
that's
a
valid
federal
constitutional
law,
because
the
issue
of
taking
has
never
yet
been
determined?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
colorably,
but
fully?
not
just
colorably
alleged.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
us
to
review
the
federal
issue
that
was
not
decided
below
in
order
not
to
review
the
federal
issue
that
was
decided
below.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
hard
for
an
appellate
court
to
try
a
case
that
hasn't
been...
to
try
an
issue
that
hasn't
been
tried
below.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
the
obligation
to
do
it
without
condemnation?
i
don't
think
that
follows.
has
the
obligation
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
white,
just
in
case
we
reach
the
merits,
do
you
want
to
say
a
few
words
about
why
we
shouldn't
imply
a
monetary
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sure
does,
except
for
the
interim
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
shouldn't
we
imply--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
may
be,
but
during
that
delay
the
person
has
been
deprived
of
the
use
of
the
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
cases?
what
other
cases
are
you
talking
about?
maybe
it
is.
