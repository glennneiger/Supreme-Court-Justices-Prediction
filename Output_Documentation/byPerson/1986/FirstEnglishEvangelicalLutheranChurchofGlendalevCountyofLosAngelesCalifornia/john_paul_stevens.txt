justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask,
mr.
berger--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
seems
to
me
there
might
be
two
different
sorts
of
taking,
and
i'm
just
curious
as
to
what
your
allegation.
one,
you
might
allege
that
if
this
regulation
remains
in
place
and
it
prevents
us
from
building
again
in
this
area,
that
would
constitute
a
taking
for
which
we're
entitled.
you
might
additionally
allege
that,
even
if
the
regulation
is
voided
by
a
declaratory
judgment
after
three
and
a
half
years
of
litigation,
that
the
three
and
a
half
years
of
litigation,
inability
to
build
for
three
and
a
half
years,
is
a
separate
taking,
for
which
in
all
events
we're
entitled
to
compensation.
do
you
make
the
second
allegation
in
your
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
even
if
the
regulation
is
voided,
that
the
temporary
deprivation
of
use
would
have
been
so
serious
that
it
amounts
to
a
taking
of
your
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
that
that's
the
taking
and
if
it
remains
in
place
it's
a
taking.
but
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
you've
alleged
that
the
period
of
time
that
it
takes
to
get
your
rights
vindicated
in
court
is
also
sufficient
to
amount
to
a
taking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it's
implicit
in
all
allegations
of
taking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
allegations
of
taking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
certainly
is
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
the
temporary
deprivation
would
not
be
serious
enough
to
cross
the
constitutional
threshold?
or
do
you
think
that
that's
impossible?
if
it's
a
taking
when
it's
permanent,
a
fortiori
it's
also
a
taking
even
if
it's
a
temporary
taking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
physical
occupation.
we're
talking
about
regulatory
takings
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
inquire,
do
they
do
this
in
california,
what
you've
been
saying
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
that
they
routinely
pay
just
compensation
in
dollars
on
these
road
repair
situations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
in
california
the
rule
was
they
don't
pay
dollars
for
taking.
you're
just
telling
us
they
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
they
didn't...
i
think
justice
o'connor's
question
was
supposing
they
didn't
go
through
the
compensation
procedure,
they
just
built
a
road
in
a
way
that
denied
access,
all
the
use
of
an
adjacent
parcel
of
land,
for
90
days.
is
the
owner
of
that
parcel
of
land
entitled
in
california
to
compensation?
i
think
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
six
months.
let
me
put
it,
the
period
of
time
it
would
take
you
to
litigate
this
case
and
have
this
regulation
set
aside.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
he
be
entitled
to
compensation
in
california--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
the
same
interference
caused
by
road
repair?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
about
temporarily,
not
permanently.
we're
talking
about
temporary
interference.
i
think
that
was
justice
o'connor's
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
a
temporary
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
does
that
square
with
agins?
why
won't
they
give
just
compensation
here,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
the
state
built
a
wall
around
this
place
because
they
thought
it
was
too
dangerous,
the
flood
and
all
the
rest,
then
you
would
have
gotten
compensation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
if
they
said,
we'll
post
signs
that
say
nobody
can
enter?
then
you
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand,
but
you
have
a
kind
of
a
double-barreled
claim.
one,
you
claim
that
the
regulation
is
a
taking
if
it
remained
in
place;
and
secondly,
you
claim
that
even
if
it
were
rescinded
today,
you
suffered
damage
during
the
temporary
period
it
took
to
litigate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
a
separate
form
of
taking.
what
is
the
measure
of...
assume
the
court...
you
win
on
the
taking
claim,
the
court
says,
well,
we'll
cancel
the
regulation.
what
is
the
measure
of
damages
that
you
contend
you're
entitled
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
contend
that
in
that
situation
you'd
get
the
full
value
of
the
property,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
appraiser
found
that
at
the
date
of
cancellation
of
the
regulation
the
property
was
even
more
valuable
than
it
had
been
when
you
originally
wanted
to
build.
would
you
still
be
entitled
to
compensation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question.
do
you
contend
you're
entitled
to
compensation
in
every
case
in
which
the
regulation
is
invalidated
and
it
took
three
years
to
do
it?
or
is
there
some
special
additional
burden
you
have
to
show
about
the
harm
during
the
interval?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
every
time
you
invalidate
a
land
use
regulation,
you'd
be
entitled
to
some
compensation
for
the
loss
of
use
during
the
period
it
took
to
litigate
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
california
says,
if
you
take
it
without
just
compensation
you've
got
to
give
it
back,
just
as
if
you
take--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
cancel
the
regulation.
suppose
the
regulation
was
enacted
without
following
appropriate
procedures,
taking
without
due
process
of
law.
the
remedy
is
you've
got
to
give
it
back.
you
don't
have
to
pay
anybody
anything
for
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
two
separate
questions:
what
already
occurred;
when
you
give
it
back,
has
there
still
been
a
taking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
though,
the
first
cause
of
action,
last
allegation,
is
"ordinance
no.
11855
denies
first
church
all
use
of
lutherglen.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
that
allege
a
taking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
they
could
say
as
a
matter
of
california
law
you've
got
to
allege
the
value
and
you've
got
to
allege,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
didn't
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
we
also
have
to
look
at
the
survey?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
whatever
the
property
looks
like?
how
can
we
say
just
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance
it
doesn't
have
the
practical
consequence
that
they
say
it
has?
