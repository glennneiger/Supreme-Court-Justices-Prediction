well
now,
the
case
was
litigated,
though,
was
it
not,
under
some
temporary
ordinance,
as
opposed
to
the
one
now
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
assert
for
our
purposes
here
that
that
admittedly
temporary
ordinance
is
a
permanent
taking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
are
looking
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
that
original
temporary
ordinance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
the
record
we
have
in
front
of
us.
the
things
that
have
happened
since
are
not
part
of
that
original
trial
record.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
your
theory
would
a
municipality
or
county
that
made
it
temporarily
impossible
to
build
on
something
because
of
road
repair
or
something
of
that
kind
have
made
a
taking
then
that
requires
compensation
for
that
interim
period?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
possibly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
some
of
these
things
take
a
while.
a
major
bridge
or
a
freeway
construction
or
something
could
deprive
a
property
owner
of
access
for
a
good
while.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
your
view
that
would
require
compensation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
it
is
admittedly
for
a
temporary
duration?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
doesn't
work
against
the
state
either,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
municipalities,
right,
precisely.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
haven't
commented
on
the
underlying
theory
of
the
sg's
suggestion
in
his
brief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
self-executing
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
berger,
do
you
think
that
local
governments
don't
have
authority
to
engage
in
flood
control
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
does
the
church
plan
to
rebuild
on
a
flood
plain
where
people
have
been
killed?
is
that
the
church's
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
you
get
it
struck
down,
that's
the
church's
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
any
time
a
local
government
says,
in
this
particular
location
it's
subject
to
flooding
and
no
one
may
build
there,
that
that
is
a
taking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
a
patented
item
or
a
designer
drug
of
some
kind,
and
you
apply
for
federal
approval
and
the
regulatory
process
takes
a
long
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
yes.
you
can't
market
it
until
you
have
approval.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
make
that
assumption,
because
i
think
there
are
some
examples.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
little
hard
to
distinguish
that
from
your
theory,
frankly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
wouldn't
your
argument
be
exactly
the
same
if
your
client
had
bought
it
ten
days
before
the
regulation
went
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sure,
if
you
hadn't
used
it
for
20
years,
you
bought
the
property
ten
days
before
and
then
the
temporary
regulation
took
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
would
be
arguing
there
had
been
a
temporary
taking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
white,
there
are
some
horror
stories
out
there
of
local
governments
intentionally
running
these
things
through
the
mill
indefinitely
in
a
jurisdiction
like
california,
with
full
recognition
that
if
they
lose
on
one
they
can
make
a
minor
modification
of
the
requirement
and
go
again
and
effectively
deprive
people
forever
of
any
use.
now,
what's
an
owner
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
agins
come
pretty
close,
don't
they?
