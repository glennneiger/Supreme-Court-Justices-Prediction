justice
byron
r.
white
in
california,
i
take
it
they
say
that
you
can
get
a
declaration
of
invalidity
and
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
any
event,
what's
really
left
over
is
whether
you
can
get
damages
for
a
temporary
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
saying
that
you
can't
get
damages
for
a
temporary
taking
is
a
federal
constitutional
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
like
whether
there
was
a
taking
in
the
first
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
reach
the
remedy
until
you
find
there's
a
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
were
two
constitutional
questions
and
they
just,
they
decided
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right.
they
decided
one
of
them,
if
there
was
a
taking
you
had
no
remedy
for
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
that
we
needn't
worry
that
there
was
no
decision
below
that
there
was
a
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
i'm
trying--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
out
of
court
now,
you're
out
of
court
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
out
of
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
had
no
chance
to
prove
it
because
you're
out
of
court
for
another
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
meanwhile
you
haven't
had
the
use
of
your
property
in
any
event.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
worth
the
attorney's
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
to
decide,
do
we
want
to
avoid
one
constitutional
question
in
order
to
get
to
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
different
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
dispose
the
case
on
the
basis
that
damages
were
not
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
case
was
over
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they're
out
of
court.
how
can
they
ever
get
back
in
by
just
saying
there's
a
taking?
give
us
the
damages
because
there's
a
taking,
and
they'll
be
laughed
out
of
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wasn't
even
in
front
of
them
on
your
theory,
because
there
was
absolutely
no
reason
to
even
get
to
it.
there
was
not
a
sufficient
allegation
of
a
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
led
the
court
of
appeals
into
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
dispose
of
this
case
on
a
remedy
issue,
forget
all
this
business
about
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
your
motion
was
apparently.
justice
byron
r.
white
agins.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
your
burden
or
not,
but
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
case
on
this
particular
federal
issue,
namely
agins.
and
we
succeeded.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
