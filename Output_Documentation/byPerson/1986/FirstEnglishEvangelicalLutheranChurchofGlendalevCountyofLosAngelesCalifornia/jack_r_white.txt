mr.
jack
r.
white
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
this
court
can
reach
the
remedy
question
that
mr.
berger
so
strongly
urges
upon
the
court,
it
must
first
decide
that
it
has
jurisdiction
and
it
must
decide
that
the
issue
of
ripeness,
that
the
issue
of
remedy
is
ripe
in
this
action.
in
agins,
macdonald,
and
williamson
county,
the
three
more
recent
cases
involving
this
kind
of
question,
the
court
made
it
clear
that
it's
not
going
to
reach
questions
of
what
the
appropriate
remedy
is
for
an
alleged
regulatory
taking
arising
out
of
a
zoning
ordinance
unless
and
until
it
has
a
ripe
and
valid
taking
claim.
i
take
strong
issue
with
mr.
berger's
contention
in
this
case
that
the
taking
claim
is
both
ripe
and
valid
and
must
be
assumed
by
this
court.
it's
neither
ripe
nor
valid,
for
all
of
the
same
reasons
in
agins
and
macdonald
and
williamson
county.
in
addition
to
that,
however,
we
believe
that
on
the
face
of
the
record
before
this
court
the
loss
of
use
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
cannot
be
regarded
as
a
taking
under
the
rule
announced
in
mugler
versus
kansas
by
this
court
100
years
ago,
where
the
court
drew
a
very
clear
distinction,
which
i
think
is
still
valid
today,
between
an
exercise
of
police
power
to
prevent
a
dangerous
use
of
one's
property--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
let
me
explain
why.
mr.
jack
r.
white
let
me
explain--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--well,
first
of
all,
the
constitutional
question
that
i'm
talking
about
has
to
have
been
raised
as
a
prerequisite
to
reaching
the
remedy
issue.
and
when
i
discuss
jurisdiction,
i'm
going
to
point
out
that
it
wasn't.
mr.
jack
r.
white
it
is.
the
point
right
now,
however,
is
in
this
case
the
court
in
california
did
not
assume
a
taking.
it
didn't
decide
the
issue
one
way
or
another,
because
a
motion
to
strike
does
not
call
into
question
or
it
does
not
even
raise
an
issue
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
pleadings.
mr.
jack
r.
white
it
did,
your
honor,
based
on
agins.
mr.
jack
r.
white
it
was
over,
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
r.
white
justice
white,
there
was
a
way
in
which
they
could
very
easily
have
gotten
into
court
in
this
action
and
preserved
the
issue
for
this
court.
all
they
had
to
do
was
add
a
cause
of
action
for
declaratory
relief
challenging
the
validity
of
the
ordinance.
that's
what
the
plaintiff
did
in
agins.
indeed,
it
was
the
cause
of
action
for
declaratory
relief
that
provided
appeal
jurisdiction
to
this
court.
that's
how
this
court
got
to
review
agins.
mr.
jack
r.
white
that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeal
didn't.
the
court
could
have.
mr.
jack
r.
white
it
never
passed
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
taking.
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
court
below
passed
on
the
taking
question,
because
this
court
has
said
it
regards
the
question
of
taking
as
an
antecedent
to
the
remedy
issue.
in
the
final
analysis,
it's
up
to
this
court
to
decide
whether
a
cause
of
action
for
a
taking
has
been
adequately
alleged.
mr.
jack
r.
white
your
honor,
i
think
that's
correct.
if
the
court...
let
me
explain.
if
the
court
looked
at
the
pleading
and
saw
that
the
pleading
did
not
adequately
allege
a
federal
claim,
then
the
remedy
question
should
not
be
reached.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
court
below
decided
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
sufficiency
of
stating
the
federal
claim.
it's
up
to
this
court
to
decide
if
a
federal
claim
has
not
been
properly
alleged,
and
if
a
federal
claim
has
not
been
properly
alleged--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--that's
right.
mr.
jack
r.
white
in
order
to
reach
the
remedy
question.
it
doesn't
have
to
be...
it
only
needs
to
be
colorably
alleged
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
but
for
this
court
to
reach
the
remedy
question,
unless
it's
going
to
back
away
from
what
it
said
in
agins
and
in
macdonald
and
in
williamson
county,
it's
going
to
have
to
be
satisfied
that
a
cause
of
action
was
alleged,
not
that
a
cause
of
action
that
clearly
on
its
face
wasn't
alleged,
that
the
court
below
didn't
decide
that.
because
if
it's
clear
to
this
court
looking
at
those
allegations
that
there
is
not
and
could
not
as
a
matter
of
law
be
a
regulatory
taking
in
this
case,
then
any
decision
it
gives
on
the
remedy
question
is
purely
an
advisory
opinion.
it's
not
going
to
apply
to
this
case.
and
the
point
i
am
making
is,
on
the
face
of
the
allegations
in
this
complaint
no
cause
of
action
was
stated
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
jack
r.
white
that's
correct,
because
it
is
antecedent
to
reviewing
the
federal
issue
that
is
before
the
court
now.
if
there's
no
federal
claim
asserted,
then
the
question
of
whether
there
might
be
a
remedy
if
a
federal
claim
had
been
asserted
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
jack
r.
white
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
r.
white
no,
that
does
not,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
it's
a
bare
conclusion.
in
agins
and
macdonald,
the
same
kind
of
allegations
were
treated
as
conclusions,
but
the
reason
for
that--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--that's
correct.
mr.
jack
r.
white
and
in
addition
to
that...
no,
they
didn't
allege
anything
but
that
it
denies
all
use,
which
is
the
barest
of
conclusions.
beyond
that,
however,
as
the
court
recognized
in
agins
and
in
macdonald,
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
actual
provisions
of
the
ordinance.
and
it
has...
in
those
cases
what
it
did
is
it
compared
the
actual
provisions
of
the
ordinance
with
the
bare
conclusory
allegation
that
it
denies
all
use.
if
the
court
looks
at
these
ordinances...
and
by
"these
ordinances"
i
mean
the
temporary
ordinance,
which
is
the
only
ordinance
that
is
the
basis
of
the
complaint
in
this
case...
and
if
it
looks
at
the
permanent
ordinance,
it'll
see
that
it
doesn't
deny
all
use
at
all.
mr.
jack
r.
white
the
survey?
mr.
jack
r.
white
well,
the
question
is
who
has
the
burden
of
presenting
the
facts--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
real
question
is
who
has
the
burden
of
presenting
it
to
the
court
in
a
fashion
that
raises
the
issue
and
preserves
it
for
appeal.
and
if
they
allege
nothing
but
a
single
bare
conclusion
which
this
court
would
have
to
say
without
more
doesn't
state
a
taking,
then
they
didn't
state
a
taking.
that's
not
our
fault;
it's
their
fault.
mr.
jack
r.
white
why
would
who
go
to
the
trouble
of
deciding
the
remedy
issue?
mr.
jack
r.
white
because
that
was
the
only
issue
in
front
of
them.
the
motion
to
strike--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--no.
the
county
filed
a
motion
to
strike
based
on
the
grounds
that
the
allegations
were
irrelevant.
they
were
irrelevant
based
on
the
agins
decision,
which
had
been
decided
just
a
matter
of
months
before
the
motion
was
filed.
the
agins
decision
said
in
essence,
if
you
have
a
regulatory
taking
claim,
the
proper
remedy
is
declaratory
relief,
not
inverse
compensation.
mr.
jack
r.
white
we
led
the
court
of
appeals
into
it,
but
the
plaintiff
has--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
r.
white
well,
but--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--but
why
was
it
the
county's
burden
to
do
something
beyond
what
was
necessary--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--i'm
sorry.
we
wanted
to
get
rid
of
it
based
on
the
california
supreme
court
decision
that
said
this
is
not
a
proper
remedy--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--for
a
taking.
as
i
started
to
say
before,
the
remedy
could
have
been
preserved
for
this
court
very
simply,
by
adding
a
declaratory
relief
action.
the
complaint
was
amended
twice.
it
was
amended
once
a
couple
of
years
after
the
motion
to
strike
had
been
granted.
they
did
not
add
the
cause
of
action
for
declaratory
relief.
had
they
done
so,
then
the
issue
would
have
been
preserved
for
this
court.
it
would
have
been
a
perfect
issue.
the
court
would
then...
the
california
court
would
have
had
to
pass
on
the
taking
issue,
because
now
there's
a
declaratory
relief
cause
of
action
in
front
of
them.
they
have
to
judge
the
validity
of
the
ordinance.
so
there
was
a
very
simple
technique
for
the
church
to
get
the
issue
before
this
court.
it
didn't.
the
county
elected
to
do
something
that
the
california
supreme
court
said
it
could
do,
and
it's
true
that
that...
that
by
doing
that
they
didn't
get
a
review
of
their
taking
issue.
but
they
could
have
done
it.
they
could
have
done
it
even
after
the
motion
had
been
granted,
by
asking
to
amend
to
add
a
cause
of
action
for
declaratory
relief.
so
it's
not
just
the
county's
fault
that
the
issue
isn't
here
before
this
court.
it's
every
bit
as
much
the
fault
of
the
plaintiff,
and
it's
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
present
the
federal
issue
and
preserve
it.
and
i
submit
that
if
anybody
is
to
bear
the
burden
of
this
fault,
it
should
be
the
plaintiff
and
not
the
county.
mr.
jack
r.
white
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
r.
white
but
a
motion
to
strike
does
not
test
the
validity
of
the
allegations.
a
motion
to
strike,
as
distinguished
from
a
demurrer,
simply
says
they're
irrelevant;
whether
they're
true
or
not,
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
jack
r.
white
what
it
said
was--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--no,
my
recollection
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
if
there
is
a
total
taking.
mr.
jack
r.
white
but
there
is
only
a
total
taking
or
a
total
denial
of
use
that
amounts
to
a
taking
if
the
county
does
not
have
the
right
to
prevent
that
use.
let
me
move
to
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
before,
which
is
why
a
mere
allegation
of
denial
of
all
use,
even
if
it's
accepted
as
a
fact,
not
treated
as
a
conclusion
of
law,
even
if
it's
accepted
as
a
statement
of
fact
by
this
court,
that
doesn't
state
a
taking
claim.
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
is
from
the
very
facts
in
this
record
some
of
which
are
in
the
trial
transcript
that's
before
the
court,
some
of
which
can
be
judicially
noticed,
we
have
a
safety
regulation.
the
rule
of
mugler
versus
kansas
applies
here.
under
mugler
versus
kansas,
a
government
has
the
right
to
prohibit
a
dangerous
use
of
land.
and
what
the
court
said
100
years
ago
in
that
case
is
that
that
is
not
a
taking,
it's
not
the
kind
of
regulation
for
which
the
government
must
pay
compensation.
mugler
versus
kansas
has
been
reiterated
in
other
cases,
in
goldblatt
versus
town
of
hempstead,
and
a
recently
as
this
court's
opinion
in
the
penn
central
case
and
in
chief
justice
rehnquist's
dissent
in
that
case,
where
both
the
court
and
the
dissent
agreed
on
one
key
point,
and
that
is
that
when
you're
dealing
with
a
regulation
aimed
at
protecting
the
health
and
safety
of
the
citizens
you're
dealing
with
a
different
animal.
what
you
have
there
is
an
exception
to
the
normal
rule
that
a
regulation
which
destroys
property
values
can
be
regarded
as
a
taking,
because
if
all
the
government
entity
is
doing
is
protecting
the
citizens
from
a
dangerous
use
of
land
then
it
has
not
only
the
right
to
do
that
without
paying
compensation,
but
i
submit
the
obligation
to
do
it.
suppose
we
accept
the
proposition--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--well,
the
bottom
line
is
this.
the
bottom
line
is
suppose...
and
i
think
that
is
what
we
can
assume
is
the
case
here...
suppose
a
regulation
in
fact
denies
all
use.
now,
we
don't
concede
that,
but
if
the
court
wants
to
accept
that
as
a
general
proposition,
that
it's
bound
by
that
conclusory
allegation
and
this
one
in
fact
denies
all
use.
the
county's
position
is
that
use
is
dangerous,
and
the
fact
that
a
mugler
type
regulation
which
prevents
a
dangerous
use
of
land
happens
to
deprive
the
property
owner
of
all
of
his
use
does
not
provide
an
exception
to
the
mugler
rule
that
compensation
doesn't
have
to
be
paid.
the
bottom
line
question
is
does
the
county
have
to
make
a
choice
between
allowing
a
dangerous
use
of
land
to
be
resumed
or
buy
the
land
by
paying
compensation,
because
the
only
way
to
prevent
a
dangerous
use
of
this
land
would
be
to
put
a
permanent
restriction.
then
we've
got
a
total
taking,
a
permanent
taking.
does
the
county
have
to
do
that?
is
that
the
county's
choice,
allow
them
to
make
a
dangerous
use
of
the
land
or
buy
them
out,
particularly
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
this
is
a
flood-prone
area?
when
they
bought
into
that
property
in
a
flood-prone
canyon
they
had
to
know
that
there
was
flood
danger.
indeed,
this
is
not
a
freak
situation,
as
mr.
berger
suggested.
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
were
prior
floods.
indeed,
there
was
a
1969
flood
that
did
damage
to
this
property.
the
1978
flood
was
more
severe,
but
it
was
devastating.
it
obliterated
everything
in
the
canyon.
and
we're
talking
about
a
very
narrow
mountain
canyon.
that
canyon
is
approximately
250
feet
wide,
or
at
least
the
flood
protection
area
is
250
feet
wide.
mr.
jack
r.
white
i
think
the--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--the
court
does
have
to
decide
whether
the
bare
statement
of
a
denial
of
all
use
states
a
cause
of
action
in
the
face
of
the
record
that
i
am
discussing
now,
the
facts
that
are
in
the
record.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
to
state
a
claim
of
taking
you
have
to
state
more
than
a
mere
denial
of
all
use.
mr.
jack
r.
white
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
an
adequate
federal
claim
has
been
stated
lies
with
this
court,
not
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
california.
but
of
course
that
didn't
happen
here
anyway.
they
didn't
decide
one
way
or
another.
had
they
done
so,
it's
quite
clear
they
would
have
decided
there
was
no
taking,
because
under
california
law
flood
plain
management
regulations
are
not
a
taking.
turner
versus
county
of
del
norte,
cited
in
our
brief,
is
a
case
based
on
the
flood
plain
regulation
adopted
under
the
california
colby-alquist
act,
which
has
provisions
exactly
like
this.
mr.
jack
r.
white
yes.
mr.
jack
r.
white
i
think
the
question...
i
think,
justice
powell,
the
question
would
be
whether
the
restriction
was
reasonably
necessary
to--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--your
honor,
i
do
believe
that's
correct.
i
think
if
the
public
entity
is
protecting
health
and
safety
and
it
prohibits
a
dangerous
use
of
land
while
allowing
other
uses...
and
there
were
other
uses
available
on
this
property...
then
it's
not
a
taking.
but
even
if
it
denies
all
use
because
the
only
possible
use
is
dangerous,
then
yes,
i
would
say
that's
not
a
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
jack
r.
white
oh,
of
course.
mr.
jack
r.
white
yes.
mr.
jack
r.
white
if
the
state
wanted
to
make
a
park?
mr.
jack
r.
white
i
think
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question.
they
zone
it,
they
downzone
it,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
mr.
jack
r.
white
do
we
have
the
safety
element
involved
here?
mr.
jack
r.
white
no
safety?
oh,
well
then
that's
different,
because
what
they've
done--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--yes.
well,
under
the
california
rule
what
you
would
have
to
do
is
challenge
it.
if
it
was
declared
invalid,
then
the
public
agency
would
have
to
decide
whether
it
wanted
to
keep
the
regulation
or
not.
if
it
wanted
to
keep
the
regulation,
then
it
would
have
to
pay
compensation.
that
fact
situation,
by
the
way,
would
then
present
the
temporary
taking
remedy
issue
that
the
court
has
been
talking
about.
but
the
difference
why
that's
a
taking,
at
least
if
the
regulation
is
allowed
to
be
permanent...
and
there's
a
question
about
whether
it's
a
taking
if
it's
only
permanent.
but
if
it
was
permanently
down-zoned
to
be
a
park,
then
the
public
is
getting
the
benefit
of
that
property.
in
this
case
the
public
is
not
getting
the
benefit
of
the
church's
property.
it
is
doing
nothing
more
than
saying
you
can't
put
buildings
in
the
middle
of
a
flood
channel
that's
going
to
cause
an
increase
in
the
level
of
flood
waters
downstream,
endangering
other
people.
the
county
in
this
case
did--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--in
your
zoning
case,
where
they
had
zoned
it
into
a
park,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
r.
white
well,
it
would
be
a
taking
for
which
compensation
would
be
required
if
the
zoning
regulation
remained
permanent.
now,
if
the
property
owner
challenged
the
zoning
ordinance
under
the
california
rule
and
it
was
declared
to
be
invalid
because
it
goes
too
far
under
pennsylvania
coal
versus
mcmahon...
or
mahon...
then
you'd
have
the
question
whether
it
was
a
taking
during
the
temporary
period.
my
position
on
that
is
no,
it's
not
a
temporary
taking.
mr.
jack
r.
white
if
permitted
to
stand,
yes,
i
believe
that
would
be
a
taking.
mr.
jack
r.
white
yes.
mr.
jack
r.
white
yes.
the
difference
again
is
what
the
county
would
be
doing
your
hypothetical,
justice
powell,
is
it
would
be
saying:
you
can't
use
your
property,
so
the
public
can
come
on
and
use
it,
or
at
least
enjoy
the
open
space,
enjoy
the
benefits
of
it.
that
is
a
restriction
on
property
that
benefits
the
public
as
a
whole.
it
doesn't
protect
them
from
anything.
mugler
versus
kansas'
rationale,
which
distinguishes
between
police
power
regulation
for
safety
purposes
and
taking
unoffending--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--absolutely,
absolutely.
justice
marshall,
this
regulation
was
adopted
by
the
county...
and
this
is
in
the
record...
in
an
effort
to
comply
with
the
national
flood
insurance
program,
which
requires
regulations
like
this.
the
national
flood
insurance
program
provides
federally
assisted
flood
insurance
to
flood-prone
areas
only
if
the
local
government
agencies
adopt
flood
plain
management
regulations
that
restrict
construction
in
natural
flood
channels.
that's
exactly
what
the
county
did
here.
if
the
court
holds
that
that's
a
taking,
then
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
compensation
paid
throughout
the
united
states
in
all
these
flood
plains
where
local
government
entities
are
trying
to
comply
with
the
federal
regulations
to
restrict
construction
in
flood
plains.
the
reason
construction
in
flood
plains
is
being
restricted
is
that
it's
dangerous.
it's
dangerous
because
it
raises
the
flood
level.
it's
dangerous
because
it
causes
a
surge
of
water
downstream,
and
when
the
building
breaks
up,
as
these
buildings
did...
what
more
proof
do
we
need
than
the
actual
events
of
this
case...
you've
got
tons
of
debris,
in
addition
to
all
the
backed
up
water,
going
downstream,
damaging
downstream
property
owners
and
taking
lives.
the
federal
government
has
said
that's
dangerous
and
we've
got
to
stop
that,
and
so
if
you
want
federal
assistance
in
getting
flood
insurance,
you
local
governments
have
got
to
adopt
regulations
that
restrict
new
construction
in
flood
plains.
mr.
jack
r.
white
yes,
justice
scalia,
i
will.
i
think
what
you
have
under
the
california
rule
is
a
situation
where
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
it
interferes
with
the
legislative
prerogative
for
the
court
to
order
it
in
essence
to
exercise
its
power
of
eminent
domain.
and
declaring
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
satisfies
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
removes
the
offending
regulation.
in
essence,
the
permanence
has
been
lifted.
mr.
jack
r.
white
except
for
the
interim
period,
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
r.
white
because
the
interim
period
is
nothing
more
than
a
delay
inherent
in
the
regulatory
process.
it's
no
different
than
delays
on
trying
to
get
permits.
it's
no
different
than
a
whole
host
of
delays
that
are
caused
by
various
kinds
of
building
and
safety
regulations.
mr.
jack
r.
white
but
they
do
in
all
the
other
cases.
is
it
a
constitutional
taking
of
use
in
all
those
cases?
if
that's
so,
then
when
there's
delay--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--a
delay
in
issuing
a
building
permit
perhaps.
you
can't
build
on
the
property
until
you
get
a
permit,
and
you
have
to
go
through
a
number
of
attempts
to
get
a
permit.
perhaps
along
the
way
there
is
an
arbitrary
denial
of
one
of
them,
and
then
five
months
later
it's
finally
granted.
has
there
been
a
taking
for
five
months?
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
that
that
kind
of
temporary
harm,
if
you
will,
rises
to
the
level
of
an
appropriation
of
property,
because
that's
what
the
court
has
said
you
have
to
have
for
a
regulatory
taking
that
doesn't
involve
any
kind
of
physical
invasion,
a
mere
loss
of
use
of
property.
mr.
jack
r.
white
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
know
of
any
horror
stories.
i've
seen
references
to
horror
stories
in
law
review
articles,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
actual
case
involving--
mr.
jack
r.
white
--well,
the
agins,
i
don't
know
what
happened
after
the
agins
decision
was
decided.
but
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
taking
in
the
agins
case.
but
my
point
is
i
don't
think
a
rule
of
general
application
should
be
adopted
on
the
assumption
that
some
regulatory
agencies
may
be
acting
in
bad
faith
when
other
regulatory
agencies,
like
the
county
of
los
angeles,
which
adopted
a
regulation
that
it
thought
was
in
compliance
with
the
national
flood
insurance
program...
why
should
the
county
be
penalized
with
a
rule
that's
based
in
part
on
a
policy
that
assumes
there's
going
to
be
gamesmanship
when
it
didn't
engage
in
any
gamesmanship?
so
if
there's
going
to
be
compensation
for
a
temporary
harm
because
a
regulation
has
gone
too
far,
i
would
draw
a
line
at
the
situation
where
there
is
some
kind
of
showing
of
bad
faith
or
intentional
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
zoning
authorities
to
go
beyond
what
is
permissible.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
there
was
no
way
on
god's
earth
that
the
county
of
los
angeles
could
have
known
when
it
adopted
what
it
thought
was
a
badly
needed
safety
regulation
in
accordance
with
the
federal
regulations
that
it
was
going
to
have
to
pay
some
compensation
for
it
because
it
had
crossed
over
that
line.
so
i
would
draw
the
line
for
compensation
for
temporary
harms
where
there
is
some
kind
of
intent
or
bad
faith.
and
if
there
isn't
any,
then
i
don't
think
that
there
should
be
any
compensation.
