justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
about
the
discussion
of
temporary
taking.
as
long
as
the
ordinance
is
on
the
books,
you
have
a
taking,
don't
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
as
of
today,
the
argument
in
this
case,
are
we
to
consider
it
as
a
temporary
or
a
permanent
taking?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
we
leave
the
ordinance
in
effect,
it'll
be
a
permanent
taking
so
far
as
we
know,
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
white,
did
not
the
court
of
appeals,
the
california
court
of
appeals,
assume
the
correctness
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
made
a
motion
to
strike.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
quote
from
agins,
the
california
supreme
court
case
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
total
taking
of
use?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
referring
to
the
ordinance
that
was
in
the
complaint.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
right,
but
you
may
be.
i
don't
have
the
opinion
here.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you're
talking
about
flood
control.
the
mississippi
river
floods
with
some
frequency
large
areas
of
particularly
louisiana.
let's
assume,
for
example,
that
the
state
of
louisiana,
because
of
the
cost
that
the
state
incurred
whenever
there
was
a
serious
flood,
that
no
one
could
build
on
property
within
ten
miles
of
the
mississippi
river.
would
there
be
any
taking
under
your
analysis?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
assume
it
was
reasonably
necessary;
so
that
if
you
owned
property
within
that
area
you
get
zero
compensation,
is
that
your
construction
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
me
give
you
another
one.
there's
a
great
deal
of
liberality
with
respect
to
zoning
ordinances,
going
back
to
our
decision,
or
this
court's
decision
in
euclid.
but
let's
assume
a
zoning
ordinance
that
said
with
respect
to
someone's
property
that
it
not
only
cannot
be
built
on,
but
the
state
wants
to
make
a
part
there.
would
there
be
any
taking?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course
there
would
be?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
a
zoning
ordinance,
a
zoning
ordinance
that
zones
a
property
for
park
use
only.
you
bought
it
because
you
were
going
to
build
a--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--and
you
bought
the
property
when
it
was
zoned,
say,
for
residential.
and
20
years
later
or
ten
years
later
or
the
next
day,
without
your
having
any
knowledge
of
the
zoning
ordinance
being
pending,
the
city
zones
your
property
so
that
you
could
not
use
it
for
any
purpose.
it's
going
to
make
a
public
park.
is
the
zoning
ordinance
valid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no
safety
element.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
wait
a
minute.
would
you
be
entitled
to
compensation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
there
be
a
taking,
for
which
compensation
would
be
allowed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
would
be
compensation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
coming
back
to
this
case,
let's
assume
that
there
had
never
been
a
flood,
no
threat
of
flood.
the
county
just
decided
this
would
make
a
lovely
public
park
and
so
it
said
to,
whatever
it
is,
to
the
appellant
in
this
case:
we
are
taking
your
property
for
the
purpose
of
a
public
park;
it's
beautiful
for
that
purpose.
would
that
be
a
taking?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
would?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
because
of
the
flood,
that's
the
difference?
