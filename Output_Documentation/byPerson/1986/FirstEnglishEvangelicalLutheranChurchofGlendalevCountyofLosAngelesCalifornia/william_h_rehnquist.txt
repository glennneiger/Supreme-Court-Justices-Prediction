mr.
berger,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
you
raised
a
federal
constitutional
claim
of
this
sort
in
the
california
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
it,
at
any
rate,
to
reach
a
different
conclusion
than
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
reached.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
california
rules
allow
notice
pleading,
the
way
the
federal
rules
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
berger.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
white.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
that
go
beyond
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeal,
mr.
white?
i
thought
that
they
had
assumed
for
purposes
of
decision
that
there
was
a
taking
and
they
said
under
california
law,
even
if
there
was
a
taking
here,
you're
not
entitled
to
damages
by
reason
of
temporary
deprivation.
i
don't
think
they
really
decided
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
taking.
they
assumed
there
was
one.
now,
do
you
want
us
to
look
into
that
and
say,
well,
no
matter
what
california
law
is,
we
don't
think
there
was
a
taking
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
very
strange
procedure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
what
the
california
court
of
appeals
said
here.
if
they
had
said
that,
perhaps
it
would
have
been
an
entirely
permissible
disposition
to
say,
you
didn't
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action
so
you
don't
get
a
ruling.
but
the
california
court
of
appeals
didn't
go
on
that
basis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
they
could
have,
but
it
didn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
we
have
to
say
without
more
that
this
didn't
state
a
taking?
i
mean,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
that
sort
of
an
allegation
might
not
be
sufficient
under
the
federal
rules,
and
i'm
not
at
all
clear
as
to
what
california
requires.
but
from
the
california
court
of
appeals
decision,
i
gather
it
didn't
require
much
more.
why
would
they
go
to
the
trouble
of
deciding
the
remedy
issue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
white,
supposing
the
california
court
of
appeals
had
expressly
said:
the
plaintiff's
complaint
in
this
case
states
only
that
the
regulation
denies
them
all
use
of
their
property;
the
appellee
says
this
is
not
enough
to
state
a
claim
for
taking;
but
under
our
pleading
law
we
hold
that
it
is.
would
you
still
say
that
we
should
require
more
than
the
california
courts
do
to
state
a
claim
of
taking?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
white.
mr.
berger,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
berger.
the
case
is
submitted.
