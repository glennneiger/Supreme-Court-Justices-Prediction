mr.
michael
m.
berger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
last
term
in
macdonald,
sommer
&
frates
versus
county
of
yolo,
this
court
found
itself
unable
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
just
compensation
guarantee
is
invoked
when
a
local
government
regulation
takes
the
use
of
private
property,
and
it
found
itself
unable
to
each
that
question
because
the
california
court
of
appeals
had
based
its
decision
on
two
separate
independent
grounds:
one,
that
no
taking
had
been
properly
alleged
in
the
complaint;
and
two,
that
even
if
one
had
been
properly
alleged
in
the
complaint,
that
california
law
forbade
just
compensation
as
a
remedy.
this
court
thus
concluded
that,
since
it
could
find
that
the
independent
holding
that
there
was
not
a
proper
allegation
of
a
taking
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
decision,
it
need
not
reach
the
compensation
issue.
this
case
is
different.
here
the
california
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
only
one
issue,
and
it
reached
its
conclusion
for
only
one
reason.
and
since
that
takes
only
one
sentence,
i'd
like
to
reread
it
to
the
court:
"we
conclude
that
because
the
united
states
supreme
court
has
not
yet
ruled
on
the
question
of
whether
a
state
may
constitutionally
limit
the
remedy
for
a
taking
to
non-monetary
relief,
this
court
is
obligated
to
follow
agins.
"
of
course,
the
agins
opinion
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
referring
to
was
the
1979
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
which
concluded
that
monetary
damages
in
the
form
of
just
compensation
are
not
available
for
a
regulation
which
takes
the
use
of
property.
thus,
adhering
to
the
respect
which
this
court
in
macdonald
said
must
be
paid
to
the
decisions
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
on
matter
of
local
law
and
local
pleading,
we
would
submit
that
the
compensation
issue
which
the
court
was
unable
to
reach
in
macdonald
is
squarely
before
the
court
in
this
case,
because
it's
the
only
question
of
a
federal
nature
that
the
california
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
and
it's
the
only
issue
that
was
litigated
on
this
question
in
the
california
courts.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
sir.
and
that's
the
issue
that
the
california
court
of
appeals
dealt
with.
they
clearly
analyzed
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
agins
in
light
of
what
had
happened
in
this
court
in
its
decisions
since
agins,
primarily
the
san
diego
gas
&
electric
opinions,
and
concluded
that
this
court
had
not
yet
clearly
enough
indicated
what
its
feelings
were
for
california
to
reach
a
different
conclusion,
and
therefore
it
found
itself
bound
by
the
california--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--well,
that's
true,
and
for
any
california
court
to
reach
a
different
conclusion.
in
the
reply
brief,
for
example,
we've
collected
all
of
post-agins
california
decisions.
the
california
supreme
court
twice
since
agins
has
reiterated
the
rule
that
regulations
cannot
lead
to
just
compensation.
the
california
court
of
appeals
in
a
dozen
or
more
cases
in
varying
contexts
has
held
that
damages
under
just
compensation
cannot
be
awarded
for
a
regulatory
taking
of
property,
and
they've
held
that
even
in
cases
which
were
expressly
brought
as
federal
civil
rights
cases
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
in
state
courts.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that
is
what
the
california
courts
say.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
well,
that
i
suppose
would
go
along
with
the
declaration
of
invalidity.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
if
you
get
a
declaration
of
invalidity,
what's
left
is
compensation
for
the
other
period
of
time,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it's
a
question
of
degree
and
of
degree
only.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
in
this
case
the
complaint
alleged
there
was
a
taking.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
nobody
challenged
that.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
and
the
courts
only
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
the
remedy--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--was
just
compensation.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
no,
they
assumed
one
of
them.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
but
they
assumed
that
the
pleading
under
local
law--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--adequately
alleged
a
taking.
and
having
adequately
alleged
a
taking,
what
the
county
said
was,
those
allegations
are
immaterial.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
agree
with
your
honor
that--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--you
need
not
be
concerned
because
the
court
below
held
it
to
be
immaterial.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
believe
we
do,
your
honor.
we
make
the
allegation
that--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--the
detailed
allegations
are
not
that
express
in
the
complaint.
what
the
complaint
alleges
is
that
the
ordinance
which
was
adopted--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--it
seems
to
me
that's
implicit
in
the
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it
was
never
questioned
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
believe
it
is,
and
as
nobody
ever
questioned
it--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--well,
in
the
colorful
language
of
this
court
in
loretto,
taking
doesn't
depend
on
whether
it's
bigger
than
a
breadbox.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
understand
that
that
was
a
physical
occupation
rather
than
a
regulatory
taking.
and
you
know,
whether
we're
in
fact
able
to
prove
that
this
was
a
taking,
that
it
crossed
the
threshold,
is
an
issue
that
we
haven't
reached
in
this
case
yet,
because
the
california
court
dismissed
the
case.
and
it
may
be
that
when
we
go
back
to
trial
the
evidence
won't
show
a
taking,
or
the
evidence
wouldn't
have
shown
a
significant
diminution
in
the
value
of
the
property.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
but
that's
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
allegations
are
that
the
regulation
did
in
fact
take
the
use
of
property.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
at
this
point,
yes.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
technically,
it's
called
fact
pleading,
but
the
facts
that
are
required
to
be
pled
in
the
complaint
are
equivalent
to
federal
notice
pleading.
they
are
very...
only
the
basic
fundamental
facts
are
required
to
be
pled
in
the
complaint,
ultimate
facts
the
california
court
calls
them,
rather
than
evidentiary
facts.
and
it's
clear
as
a
matter
of
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
county
certainly
understood
what
those
minimal
allegations
meant,
because
they
immediately
responded
by
moving
to
strike
them
on
the
ground
that
under
the
agins
case
there
could
be
no
recovery
of
compensation
for
a
taking
by
a
regulation.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
your
honor.
as
long
as
the
ordinance
is
there,
it
takes
the
use
of
property.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
well,
this
temporary
taking
is
now
nine
years
old,
and
i
strongly
suspect
from
an
economist's
standpoint
that
if
you
have
taken
something
for
that
long
you've
taken
it
permanently.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
case
was
originally
filed
under
what
they
called
a
temporary
ordinance,
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that
temporary
ordinance
was
in
effect
for
three
years,
of
course,
before
they
replaced
it.
the
general
effect
of
the
permanent
ordinance,
so-called,
is
the
same
as
the
temporary
ordinance,
if
allowed--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--i
think-what
this
case
involves
is
not
the
so-called
temporary
ordinance
or
the
so-called
permanent
ordinance,
but
the
county's
pattern
of
regulation
of
this
particular
piece
of
land.
it
started
out
with
their
moratorium,
their
temporary
ordinance
so
that
they
could
study
what
use
they
wanted
made
on
this
land,
and
they
consistently
followed
it
through.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
correct.
if
remanded,
that
of
course
would
become
of
interest
to
both
parties,
what
has
happened
since,
because
the
temporary
ordinance,
the
original
ordinance,
of
course,
flatly
prohibits
any
use
on
the
property
and
doesn't
allow
the
county
to
make
the
arguments
that
it
does--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--no,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it
would
depend
on
what
the
facts
showed.
in
this
case
we're
not,
for
example,
talking
about
a
temporary
road
repair
that
requires
a
minor
detour
that
may
have
disrupted
the
use
for
a
short
period
of
time.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
they
can.
and
under--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--under
settled
law,
your
honor,
if
access
is
totally
deprived
to
property,
that
is
the
taking
of
the
property
interest
and
requires
compensation.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
ma'am.
the
highway
people
routinely
condemn
temporary
easements
so
that
they
can
perform
just
that
kind
of
construction
without
having
to
litigate
with
people
over
inverse
compensation
cases.
they
acknowledge
that
they
are
taking
their
access
and
interfering
with
their
use,
and
they
directly
go
ahead
and
buy
that
interest.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
county
effort
to
turn
what
had
for
20
years
been
a
usable--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--not
on
minor
road
repairs,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i'm
talking
there
about
direct
condemnation.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
90
days,
i
suspect--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--yes.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
think
if
you
looked
at
a
case
that
the
california
supreme
court
decided
called
jones
versus
people,
which
is
precisely
that
case,
where
a
parcel
of
vacant
land
was
rendered
inaccessible
because
of
a
freeway--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--well,
eventually
they
did
get
access,
eventually.
but
they
were
deprived
of
access.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
and
the
supreme
court
said
that
damages
had
to
be
paid,
just
compensation
had
to
be
paid.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
they
view
regulations
very
differently
from
the
way
that
they
view
anything
else.
and
the
only
way
that
i
can
explain
it
to
your
honor
is
in
that
fashion.
i
can't
make
sense
of
it
personally.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
believe
if
they'd
have
done
that--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--i
believe
if
they
had
done
that
the
courts
would
have
viewed
it
differently.
but
having
done
it
only
by
regulation,
they
find
that
it
doesn't
require
compensation.
and
it's
exactly
that
kind
of
a
hypothetical,
your
honor,
that
concerns
us.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
we
did.
that
argument
was
expressly
made,
your
honor.
you'll
find
in
the
briefs
a
separate
response
that
we
did
to
the
county's
second
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
and
as
appendices
to
that
we
have
included
pieces
of
the
briefs
that
we
filed
in
the
california
courts.
and
in
there
we
expressly
directed
the
california
court's
attention
to
everything
that
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
had
done
since
agins
and
concluded
that
agins
had
no
federal
underpinning,
that
it
was
totally
contrary
to
what
was
going
on
in
this
court
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
particularly.
the
ninth
circuit
three,
i
think
now
four,
times
has
said
that
agins
at
best
is
suspect
and
at
worst
doesn't
represent
the
views
of
a
majority
of
the
u.s.
supreme
court.
the
problem
we
face
in
california
with
the
ninth
circuit
is
in
getting
them
not
to
abstain,
to
take
these
cases,
because
they
keep
wanting
the
california
court
to
clean
up
its
own
act.
but
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
california
courts
of
appeals
continue
to
follow
this
line,
to
hew
to
the
agins
line,
and
say
that
if
it's
a
regulation,
as
opposed
to
building
a
wall
around
it,
then
you
don't
get
compensation.
you
know,
this
is
the
same
argument
that
was
made
far
more
eloquently
than
i
can
make
by
justice
brennan
in
his
san
diego
gas
dissent
and
justice
white
in
macdonald.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that
it
doesn't
matter
how
you
interfere
with
the
owner's
rights
from
the
owner's
standpoint.
it's
the
same
thing
if
you
built
the
wall
or
if
you
passed
the
regulation.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
well,
obviously
we
haven't
gotten
that
far.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
sincerely
doubt
it.
it
would
be
subject
to
appraisal
testimony
and,
as
in
any
other
inverse
compensation
case,
i
suspect
what
would
happen
is
that
the
appraiser
would
use
some
form
of
rental
value
or
return
on
investment
value.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that
it
was
even
more
valuable?
yes,
i
think
we
would
still
be
entitled
to
compensation
for
the
lost
use
of
the
property.
how
the
appraisers
would
decide
to
value
it
is
a
whole
different
question,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
get
tied
up
in
the
nuances
of
valuation.
what
we
need
in
california
particularly
is
for
this
court
to
tell
california
that
the
compensation
question
needs
to
be
faced.
as
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
most
recently...
that's
the
most
recent
case
which
adopted
the
compensation
resolution
to
this
issue...
we
don't
need
to
instruct
the
trial
courts
at
this
point
on
how
to
value
the
issue;
we
can
let
them
experiment.
that's
what
trial
courts
are
for.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
if
the
property
in
fact...
if
the
use
of
the
property
was
taken
during
that
interim,
i
believe
that
is
a
taking,
and
the
taking
would
require
a
trial
on
what
just
compensation
is
due
for
that
period
of
time.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
think
it's
potential,
it's
possible
that
there
may
be
some
cases
where
there
in
fact
was
no
value
lost.
or
there
may
be
cases
where
there
was
no
use
being
made
or
going
to
be
made
during
that
time.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
let
me
answer
that
in
several
ways,
your
honor.
first,
although
it's
never
been
mentioned
in
this
case,
the
allegations
of
the
facts
in
this
case
would
support
an
action
under
1983.
1983,
as
this
court
knows,
creates
no
substantive
rights.
it's
just
a
remedial
vehicle.
and
what
we've
been
arguing
about
in
this
case
is
the
substantive
right
to
just
compensation.
so
the
issue
of
what
remedial
vehicles
get
used
hasn't
been
brought
up.
i
think
that
the
allegations
in
this
complaint
are
adequate
to
state
a
1983
cause
of
action
if
that
were
true.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
1983
only
works
against
state
governments.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it's
something
that
he's
totally
uninvolved
in,
your
honor.
but
secondly,
in
the
california
courts--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--you
have
eleventh
amendment
problems
against
the
state.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
we're
talking
here
only
about
local
government
agencies.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
no.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
underlying
theory
of
the
solicitor
general,
your
honor,
i
candidly
found
insulting
to
this
court
because
it
was
based
on
expressly
stating
that
a
whole
raft
of
opinions
of
this
court,
including
most
recently
u.s.
versus
clarke,
in
which
this
court
said
the
fifth
amendment
just
compensation
guarantee
is
self-executing,
are
simply
wrong.
for
example...
and
i
think
this
court
said
it
very
clearly
in
jacobs
versus
united
states--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--that's
true,
you
did
say
it.
in
jacobs--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--let
me
show
you
in
jacobs.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
in
jacobs
versus
united
states,
290
u.s.,
this
court
said
in
the
holding
the
right
to
recover
just
compensation
was
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
it
rested
upon
the
fifth
amendment.
statutory
recognition
was
not
necessary.
a
promise
to
pay
was
not
necessary.
such
a
promise
was
implied
because
of
the
duty
to
pay
imposed
by
the
amendment.
the
right
to
compensation
arose
from
the
constitution,
not
from
the
statute.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
also--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--of
course.
if
there's
no
taking,
then
the
question
will
never
be
reached.
but
in
this
case
it's
the
only
question
we
have:
what
is
the
remedy
once
we
have
a
taking?
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
don't
think
they're
saying
that
at
all.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
a
matter
of
fact.
that's
like
saying
we're
not
going
to
allow
the
sun
to
rise
tomorrow.
what
the
county
does
is
to
take
the
property.
if
california
wants
to
call
that
lettuce
instead
of
calling
it
a
taking,
it
doesn't
change
what
happened.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
but
you
can't
give
back
what's
been
taken
in
the
past.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that
can
be,
yes,
that's
right.
but
what
happens,
your
honor,
is
it
provides
no
remedy
for
the
taking
that's
already
occurred,
and
it
in
fact
guarantees
nothing
about
the
future.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
don't
know
that
we've
given
it
back,
because
what
it
does
is
it
returns
the
regulation
to
the
entity
and
tells
the
entity,
draft
a
new
regulation.
now,
that
guarantees
nothing.
as
justice
brennan's
dissent
in
san
diego
pointed
out
and
as
virtually
every
commentary
on
this
issue
has
pointed
out,
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
government
agencies
that
will
take
those
regulations
back,
dicker
with
them
a
little
bit,
make
minor
changes,
and
then
re-enact
them
and
force
the
property
owner
to
litigate
all
over
again.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
exactly,
and
that's
entirely
the
problem.
you
have
not
had
the
use
of
your
property
while
they've
been
playing
this
game
with
you.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
oh,
not
for
a
minute
do
i
make
that
assertion,
justice
o'connor.
i
believe
that
they
do.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
church
can't
plan
to
rebuild,
because
the
ordinance
won't
allow
it.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
if
the
ordinance
were
struck
down,
the
church
would
like
to
be
able
to
use
the
property
the
way
it
had
used
the
property.
and
it's
not
building
in
a
flood
plain
where
people
had
drowned.
no
question
there
was
a
tragic
flood
that
occurred
in
that
area.
it
was
a
freak
of
weather
conditions,
as
the
record
shows.
but
the
point
is
that
what
the
county
has
done
is
to
engage
in
the
valid
purpose
of
flood
control,
something
which
we
acknowledge.
we
never
challenged
that
flood
control
was
not
a
valid
purpose.
but
once
they've
decided
to
engage
in
a
valid
purpose,
when
that
valid
exercise
of
power
takes
property
of
private
people
for
public
use
in
the
process,
then
the
just
compensation
clause
comes
into
use.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it
could
be.
i
don't
think
that
every
time.
it
would
depend
on
the
property.
you
know,
the
market
is
what
it
is.
the
fact
is
this
property
has
been
used
for
20
years
in
this
fashion.
it
may
be
that
there
is
other
property
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
a
river
and
which
isn't
usable.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
is
there
anything
that--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--sure,
because
in
my
situation
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
regulation
which
totally
deprives
the
owner
of
property
of
its
rightful
use.
the
regulations
that
come
up
with
the
federal
government,
i
have
not
seen
any
that
come
that
totally
as
prohibitions
of
use.
and
what
we've
got
here
is
a
regulation
which
as
a
matter
of
conceded
pleading
fully
takes
the
use
of
property.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that
hasn't
deprived
you
of
the
use
of
that.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
don't
believe
that's
technically
true,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
you
can
market--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--drugs
is
a
different
stories.
patented
items
was
a
wholly
different
one.
and
as
the
court
discussed
in
ruckelshaus
versus
monsanto,
when
you
go
into
a
business
of
that
sort,
which
is
a
regulated
industry,
knowing
what
it
is
and
knowing
what
its
confines
are,
that's
an
assumption
of
risk,
if
you
will,
that
a
business
is
allowed
to
take,
and
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
that
arises
when
there
is
some
delay
in
the
process.
but
where
we
have--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--well,
i'm
sorry
that
your
honor
is
having
that
trouble.
what
i
see
in
our
case
is
a
piece
of
property
that
has
been
open
and
usable
for
at
least
two
decades
and
which
the
county
comes
in
now
and
says:
that
property
is
now
a
part
of
the
county-owned
flood
control
channel;
we're
just
not
going
to
change
the
title;
we're
going
to
let
you
keep
the
title,
but
we're
going
to
wash
the
water
through
it.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
don't
think
my
argument
would
be
quite
as
strong
as
if
we
owned
it
for
20
years.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
if
we
bought
it
ten
days
before
the
regulation
went
into
effect?
mr.
michael
m.
berger
maybe,
and
we
may
end
up
arguing
over
the
amount
of
damages,
because
if
we
had
bought
that
property
ten
days
before
the
regulation
went
into
effect,
after
the
devastating
flood,
i
strongly
suspect
that
the
market
price
would
have
been
virtually
nil.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
there
still
may
have
been
a
taking.
what
its
value
is
is
something
wholly
different,
and
i
think
that's
the
question
we're
getting
into.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
probably
not,
your
honor.
if
i
have
any
time
left,
i'd
like
to
reserve
it.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'm
a
little
confused
by
counsel's
conclusion
there
about
making
this
some
sort
of
an
intentional
tort.
we're
talking
about
the
constitution
and
the
vindication
of
rights
under
the
constitution.
there
has
never
been
any
such
intent
element
in
inverse
compensation
cases.
the
question,
as
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions,
is
what
is
the
impact
of
the
governmental
action
on
the
private
property
owner?
if
the
impact
is
to
take
the
property,
then
compensation
is
payable.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
government
was
well
intentioned
or
ill
intentioned,
and
i
would
urge
this
court
not
to
import
that
difficulty
into
these
cases.
i
was
also
a
bit
surprised
to
hear
counsel
say
he
doesn't
know
what
happened
to
the
agins'
since
the
decision
by
this
court
in
1980,
since
they
filed
an
amicus
curiae
brief
in
this
case
and
explained
exactly
what's
happened
to
them
since
1980.
they're
still
without
the
use
of
their
property.
they're
still
without
compensation,
and
the
city
of
tiburon
has
put
another
temporary
moratorium
on
their
property
after
they
got
building
permits.
now,
they're
six
years
down
the
road
from
this
court;
they
still
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
do.
that's
the
kind
of
horror
story,
justice
o'connor,
that
does
go
on
in
california,
and
it
goes
on
all
the
time.
the
people
of
this
country
need
an
answer
to
this
question.
we
urge
the
court
to
reach
the
question
and
decide
that
just
compensation
is
mandated
for
a
regulatory
taking
of
property.
