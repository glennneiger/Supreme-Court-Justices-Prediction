justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mrs.
akers,
to
the
extent
that
you're
arguing
there's
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
number,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
argument
was
made
below,
or
that
it's
even
encompassed
in
the
petition...
question
on
petition
for
certiorari.
where
it
seemed
to
me
the
question
presented
was
whether
police
can
seize
the
id
numbers
in
the
course
of
conducting
a
search,
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
as
opposed
to
probable
cause.
and
it
just
seems
to
me
maybe
you're
making
some
arguments
here
that
were
neither
raised
below
nor
fairly
encompassed
in
the
questions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
question
as
it
was
presented
to
us
just
assumed
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
assumed
the
existence
of
a
search
and
a
seizure,
and
asked
us
to
determine
a
much
more
limited
question
under
the
plain
view
exception.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
just
think
that's
a
new
question,
personally.
why
do
you
say
that
the
only
information
that
could
have
been
obtained
by
lifting
up
an
object
and
looking
underneath
is
whether
it
was
stolen
or
not?
couldn't
there
have
been
a
letter
underneath
or
something?
for
example,
in
your
other...
the
vin
case
we
had
a
year
or
two
ago,
you
had
to
pick
up
a
piece
of
paper
to
read
the
number.
and
do
you
think
it's
always
true
that
when
you
pick
up
a
piece
of
paper
or
lift
an
object
to
look
underneath
it,
you'll
never
discover
anything
except
what's
on
the
bottom
of
the
object?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mrs.
akers,
do
you
think
the
trial
court
in
this
case
found
the
officer
acted
just
out
of
curiosity--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
trial
court's
finding
was
certainly
not
clear
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
could
be
interpreted
that
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
had
to
use
a
magnifying
glass
to
bring
the
number
out
a
little
bit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
noticed
the
court
of
appeals
went
off
on...
at
least
in
part
on
the
theory
that
there
had
to
be
some
nexus
between
the
exigent
circumstances
that
gave
them
cause
to
enter
and
the
object
they
were
examining
in
plain
view.
do
you
find
any
support
in
our
cases
for
that
idea?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
hadn't
thought
there
was
a
nexus
requirement
at
all,
mr.
rood.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
anything
that
an
officer,
once
he
was
lawfully
on
the
premises,
spotted
in
plain
view,
and
that
it
was
immediately
apparent
was
evidence
of
a
crime
or
contraband,
was
subject
to
seizure,
whether
or
not
it
was
related
to
the
reason
for
entry?
