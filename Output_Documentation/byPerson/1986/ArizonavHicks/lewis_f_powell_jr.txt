powell,

mr.
rood,
any
problem
with
the
officer
seizing
all
of
the
guns?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
were
the
guns
seized?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
was
my
recollection.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
a
bullet
was
fired
through
the
floor
into
the
apartment
below.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
justified
the
search
under
exigent
circumstances.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
there
had
been
a
shotgun
among
the
weapons
there?
could
that
have
been
seized?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
suppose
it
were
a
sawed
off
shotgun.
it
couldn't
have
fired
through
the
floor.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
a
state
that
permitted
the
ownership
of
handguns,
provided
they
were
registered,
suppose
there
had
been
no
shot
fired
through,
but
the
officers
were
there
under
some
other
exigent
circumstances.
could
they
have
looked
at
the
serial
numbers
on
the
handguns
they
saw?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
this
case
turns
on
whether
or
not
the
stereo
was
turned
over?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
the
same
be
true
of
the...
i
think
they
were
called
a
stocking
mask,
but
suppose
they
had
been
ski
masks,
and
the
store
had
reported
the
ski
masks
had
been
stolen,
could
the
officers
have
turned
the
ski
masks
over?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
just
one.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
couldn't
turn
it
over?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
to
see
which
store
had
sold
it?
