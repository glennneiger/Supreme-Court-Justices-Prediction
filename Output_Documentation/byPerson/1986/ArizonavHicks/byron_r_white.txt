where
was
the
number?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
to
move
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
was
under
it,
he
had
to
turn
it
upside
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn't
have
gotten
the
search
warrant,
though,
could
you?
suppose
the
officer
hadn't
looked
at
the
serial
number,
but
he
had
these
suspicions
he
went
back
to
the
magistrate
and
said,
i
want
a
search
warrant.
these
things
don't
look
like
they
belong
there.
i
think
they're
stolen.
do
you
think
he'd
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
couldn't
have
gotten
a
warrant
to
do
what
he
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
not,
if
it
isn't
a
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
the
magistrate
should
say
is,
you
don't
need
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
you'd
have
to...
you'd
say,
well,
i
have
to
reenter
the
house.
so
i
want
a
warrant
because
i
want
to
get
the
serial
number.
justice
byron
r.
white
already
in
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
had
a
search
warrant
to
search
for
something
that
could
only
be
found
in
one
room,
for
example;
you
knew
where
it
was,
you
wanted
to
search
the
living
room.
you
see
through
the
door
a
stereo
that
looks
out
of
place.
you
wouldn't
think
you
could
exceed
the
bounds
of
your
search
warrant,
do
you,
just
on
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
part
of
your
argument
is
that
given
reasonable
suspicion,
the
only
way
that
an
officer
could
ever
check
it
out
is
either
then
or
never?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
had
to
leave
to
get
a
warrant,
he
could
never
get
a
warrant
to
get
back
into
the
house,
unless
you
said
he
can
get
a
warrant
on
reasonable
suspicion.
in
which
event,
you
might
as
well
let
him
look
at
it
in
the
first
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
except
that
i
suppose
if
you
could
get
a
warrant
on
reasonable
suspicion,
at
least
you'd
have
the
magistrate
agreeing
with
him
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
the
magistrate
would
never
have
seen
the
stereo
in
the
apartment.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
had
to
go
up
and
get
real
close?
it
was
right
on
the
top,
but
he
couldn't...
he
had
to
get
awfully
close
to
it
to
see
it.
