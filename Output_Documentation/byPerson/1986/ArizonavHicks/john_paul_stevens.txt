suppose
you
hide
your
jewels
under
your
stereo,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
need
not
merely
examine
the
exterior,
but
he
must
move
the
item
in
order
to
make
that
examination.
and
i
take
it,
when
you
move
something,
you
may
reveal
something
hidden
behind
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
that
the
exterior
of
the
stereo
had
a
little
notice
on
it,
serial
number
on
warranty;
warranty
in
desk
drawer.
could
he
open
the
desk
drawer
and
pick
out
the
warranty
and
get
the
serial
number?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
unplugging
would
be
different,
if
they
had
to
unplug
to
get
at
it,
to
turn
it
over,
for
example;
would
that
make
it
bad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
serial
number
were
on
the
face
of
the
instruments,
so
you
didn't
have
to
move
it
at
all,
you
wouldn't
even
need
the
articulable
suspicion,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you've
got
kind
of
an
intermediate
class.
if
you
have
to
move
it
a
little
bit,
it's
not
in
plain
view,
but
you
have
a
new
category
of
permissible
investigations.
and
some
serial
numbers
on
some
products
can't
be
found
unless
you
take
the
product
apart.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
would
you
draw
a
distinction
if
the
item
were
not
thought
to
be
stolen,
but
merely
were
conclusive
evidence
of
a
crime?
for
example,
say
it
was
a
gun,
and
the
serial
number
on
the
gun
would
prove
that
the
instrument
was
used
to
kill
someone.
would
you
apply
the
same
test,
or
is
your
test
limited
to
contraband?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
this
case,
if
the
stereo
might
provide
for
some
reason
i
can't
hypothesize
right
now,
might
provide
evidence
that
the
man
who
owned
it
at
that
time
also
committed
some
other
crime,
you
could
still
investigate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
of
course,
the
guns
were
different.
they
also
checked
a
lot
of
gun
numbers,
i
understand,
and
they
might
well
have
been
evidence
of
a
crime,
if...
you
know,
if
you'd
gotten
a
positive
response
on
one
of
those
instead
of
on
this
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
a
different
serial
number.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i
don't
recall
the
opinion
that
well,
but
i
thought
in
that
case
we
said
there
was
a
virtual
certainty
there
was
heroin
or
cocaine
or
something
like
that;
just
by
looked
at
it
in
the
bag.
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
we
say
the
plain
view
test
was
equated
with
virtual
certainty
that
it
was
contraband?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
he
had
a
much
better
reason
to...
there
was
a
much
greater
degree
of
probability
that
that
was
contraband
than
that
the
stereo
was
contraband.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
disagree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you've
agreed
that
it
wasn't
even
probable
cause
here.
and
surely
there
was
probable
cause
in
the
jacobson
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you've
admitted
there's
no
probable
cause
here,
so
there's
a
difference.
