mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
initially
i
want
to
say
a
couple
of
things
that
came
up
in
the
first
part
of
the
argument.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
it
has
never
been
before
argued,
until
the
petition
was
granted
here,
that
this
was
not
a
search
nor
a
seizure.
that
never
happened
in
the
lower
court.
that
was
never
argued
in
the
arizona
court
of
appeals.
so
this
is
a
new
argument
that
the
state
has
attacked
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
on.
the
other
thing
i'd
like
to
bring
to
your
attention
is
the
question
about
serial
numbers,
and
the
state's
position
that
all
they
want
to
be
able
to
do
is
see
serial
numbers.
i'm
not
sure
serial
numbers
are
strictly
on
items
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
they're
stolen
or
not
stolen.
obviously,
they
have
lot
numbers
and
all
sorts
of
things.
that
may
be
true,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
case
always.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
obviously,
they
think
they're
helpful.
our
position
is,
quite
frankly,
that
this
is
not
a
plain
view
case.
that's
been
the
position
from
the
beginning.
obviously
the
stereo
units...
and
the
court
must
be
aware,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
we're
not
just
talking
about
one
stereo.
when
the
police
came
into
the
apartment,
officer
nelson
noted
a
stereo
on
the
living
room
wall.
he
apparently
during
his
search
for
guns
noticed
another
stereo
in
the
living...
excuse
me,
in
the
bedroom.
when
he
decided
to
copy
down
all
these
stereo
numbers,
not
only
the
one
bang
and
olufsen
turntable
was
copied
from,
but
apparently,
although
the
record
isn't
clear
what
he
had
to
do
to
get
the
other
serial
numbers,
he
copied
down
a
whole
series
of
them.
and
while
he
was
phoning
in
the
serial
numbers
on
the
guns,
he
decided
he
might
as
well
phone
in
these
other
serial
numbers.
the
only
thing
that
turned
up
on
the
computer
was
this
one
piece
of
property.
at
a
later
point,
it
was
determined
the
rest
of
the
property
was
stolen.
again,
our
position
is
that
this
is
not
a
plain
view
case.
i
note
that
judge
myland,
of
the...
of
the
maryland
court
of
special
appeals
some
ten
years
ago
in
a
law
review
article
in
which
they
analyze
the
coolidge
v.
new
hampshire
decision,
said
that
those
who
overapply
the
plain
view
doctrine
to
every
situation
where
there
is...
where
there
is
visual,
open
view
have
not
learned
the
lesson
long
since
mastered
by
old
hands
at
the
burlesque
houses:
you
can't
touch
everything
you
see.
wherever
a
policeman's
eye
may
go,
his
body
need
not
follow.
the
thrust
of
the
argument
presented
by
the
state
of
arizona
is
aimed
at
the
reasonableness
of
police
conduct
once
they
were
legally
inside
mr.
hicks'
apartment.
they
argue
the
serial
numbers
were
in
plain
view.
they
weren't
in
plain
view.
the
police
officer
had
to
walk
over
and
pick
up
the
stereo
unit,
turn
it
over,
look
at
it.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
obviously.
i
have...
although
that
isn't
the
fact
here,
i
have
no
problem
with
that
necessarily.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
a
lot
of
problem
with
that
either,
although
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case,
and
that
may
be
presented
in
that
situation,
is,
there
is
no
connection
between
the
reason
that
the
officer
was
in
this
apartment
and
the
serial
numbers.
in
other
words,
the
reason--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--i
think
i
do.
i
think
both
coolidge
and
brown
talk
in
terms
of
that.
i
think
that--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--well,
i'm
not
sure
it's
nexus,
or
at
least
some--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--well,
that's
true,
if
it's
contraband,
or
if
it's
immediately
apparent
that
the
object
has
some
incriminating
nature
whatever,
it
can
be
seized.
the
district
courts
in
various
cases
have
talked
in
terms
of,
when
you
go
in
on
a
search
warrant,
or
for
any
other
exception
to
the
rule,
and
you
find
something
that
can
be
reasonable
connected
to
your
reason
for
being
in
there,
you
may...
you
might
seize
it.
an
example
might
be
one
of
the
cases
where
they're
in
on
a
search
warrant
for
stolen
property.
the
police
officer's
aware
certain
property
has
been
stolen
two
nights
before.
he
recognizes
that
property.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
they
know
these
people
who
reside
in
this
place
are
dealing
in
stolen
property
or
hold
stolen
property.
the
belief
is
that
they
should
be
able
to
seize
items
that
they
think
are
stolen
property.
and
i
don't
disagree
with
that
proposition
at
all.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
i
don't
think
so.
it
never
came
up.
the
record
in
the
case
is
unclear.
it's
my
understanding,
nothing
ever
happened
as
a
result
of
the
seizures
of
any
of
these
guns.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
the
guns
were
seized.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
that's
my
understanding,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
i'm
not
sure
that
it
could.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
could
articulate
a
reason
why
it
should
be
seized
unless
it's
a
saved
off
shotgun
and
some
sort
of
illegal-type
weapon.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
well,
that's
true.
but
under
state
law,
i
believe,
it
would
be
contraband,
illegal
to
have
sawed
off
shotguns.
so
it
could
be
seized.
it's
like
contraband.
it's
like
drugs
or
narcotics
or
whatever.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
well,
they
certainly
might
have
looked
at
the
serial
numbers.
in
other
words,
if
it
was
in
plain
view
to
them.
if
they
didn't
have
to
go
over
and
turn
it
around
and
look
at
the
stock
or
something,
it
would
be
our
position
that
if
they
saw
it,
they
could
remember
it,
write
it
down,
whatever.
but
i
don't
believe
it's
our
position
that
if
they
walked
over
and
picked
up
the
gun
and
looked
at
it
and
copied
down
the
serial
number,
that
that
would
be
permissible
for
some
other
reason.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
i
think
that's
a
crucial
point
of
this
case,
that
they
actually
went
up,
picked
it
up,
and
looked
at
the
back
of
it.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
well,
it
would
seem
to
me,
that
would
depend
upon
who
they
reported
it
to.
were
there
a
gross
of
ski
masks
there
rather
than
just
one?
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
i
don't
think
they
could
take
it,
unless
there
was
something
else.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
couldn't
turn
it
over?
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
well,
if
in
the
case,
they
were
attempting
to
look
for
guns,
they
might
pick
up
the
ski
mask
and
look
under
it.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
i...
i
have
no
problem
with
that
unless...
well,
i
do
have
a
problem
with
it.
the
fact
is,
that
they're
not
in
there
looking
for
stolen
property.
they're
in
there
looking
to
see
if
anyone's
hurt.
they're
looking
to
see
if
they
can
find
the
weapon
that
was
fired.
that's
the
only
reason
they're
there.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
and
contraband,
if
it's...
if
it's
in
plain
sight.
but
they
can't
just
go
about
making
a
general
search.
that's
what
the
state
would
ask
this
court
to
allow
them
to
do.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
only
real
basis
for
this
search
is,
this
is
a
low
rent
apartment
that
a
bullet
has
been
fired
through
the
floor
in.
and
a
person
living
in
a
low
rent
apartment
shouldn't
be
able
to
own
an
expensive
stereo.
and
i
think
that
is
clear
in
the
record
that
the
officer,
on
a
hunch,
knowing
that
stereos
are
stolen,
that
this
person
shouldn't
own
one,
decided
to
search
it.
and
that's
what
he
did.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
well--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--well,
there--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--sure--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--i
don't
think
it
is
a
reasonable
situation.
in
fact,
the
example
that
was
given
earlier
on
about
stopping
a
person
in
a...
in
a
terry
situation
to
briefly
detain
them,
if
that
person
was
wearing...
in
a
poor
neighborhood
was
wearing
a
gold
watch,
i
take
it
that
officer
nelson,
in
this
case,
would
believe
that
that's
a
reasonable
suspicion
for
him
to
take
that
watch
off
and
look
at
it.
and
that
isn't
a
reasonable
type
of
thing.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
well,
i
think--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--both
situations
are
bad.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
both
are
bad.
i
don't
think
that
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
in
this
case.
and
i
think
there
has
to
be
something
more.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
right.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
well,
we
never
had
to
contend
that
before,
but
yes.
and
i
believe--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--well,
i
think
you
have
to
get
over
the
threshold
problem
of
the
search.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
pardon
me?
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
well,
i
think
the
case
would
be
the
same
if
there
was
a
search
here
that
was
illegal,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
right.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
well,
as
i've
said,
the
focus
of
the
case
has
never
been
the
search
or
the
seizure.
it's
whether
or
not
the
object
was
in
plain
view,
and
there
was
a
sufficient
reasonable
basis
to
believe
it
was
stolen.
we
don't
believe
that
that
has
been
shown
anywhere
previously.
we'd
just
say
that
this
court
has
stated
that
searches
without
warrants
are,
per
se...
or
are
deemed
per
se
unreasonable,
unless
there
are
circumstances,
which
this
court
has
delineated
previously,
that
fit
the
facts
of
the
situation.
the
state
contends
that
the
plain
view
doctrine
is
simply
an
exemption
to
the
warrant
requirement.
they
do
that
in
their
reply
brief.
my
understanding
is
that
the
plain
view
doctrine,
according
to
coolidge,
merely
supplements
the
prior
justification
for
the
original
intrusion.
the
state
can't
point
out
any
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
as
it
applies
to
stereos.
they
are
not
inherently
stolen
property
or
contraband.
even
a--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--okay.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
well--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--he
may,
on
less
than
probable
cause,
if
he
has
some
basis,
stop
the
person,
briefly,
to
determine
who
he
is,
where
he's
going.
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
i
have
a
problem
with--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--well,
he
could
ask.
i
take
it
he
could
ask.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
that
would
be
our
position,
right.
he
couldn't
take
it.
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
if
it
goes
that
far,
yes.
because
it
would
be
the
position
that
he's
being
briefly
detained
to
check
out
where
he's
going,
he
he
is.
and
if
he
has
nothing
more,
it
wouldn't
be--
mr.
john
w.
rood,
iii
--that's
correct.
that
would
be
our...
our
position.
as
the...
unless
you
take
the
view
that
the
status
of
a
person
occupying
an
apartment
gives
a
person...
give
police
suspicion
that
they
are
involved
in
criminal
activity,
in
this
case,
there
isn't
even
reasonable
suspicion.
that
would
be
petition...
respondent's
position.
petitioner
attempts
to
argue
many
ancillary
issues,
such
as
the
facts...
the
fact
this
is
not
a
search
or
a
seizure,
and
that
mr.
hicks'
had
no
privacy
interest
in
the
stereo,
and
therefore
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply.
in
fact,
the
state's
petition,
as
i
said
earlier,
states
that
this
was
a
seizure.
to
take
the
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion,
police...
when
police
are
in
someone's
home
legitimately,
they
can
begin
a
general
rummaging
about
the
place
to
determine
if
there
is
stolen
property,
with
no
relationship
to
the
fact
that
they're
in
there
on
a
domestic
violence
call
or
an
emergency
call.
and
all
they
have
to
say,
at
a
later
point
in
court,
that
they
were
suspicious
of
the
circumstances.
the
other
argument
is
that
this
search
is
minimally
intrusive.
i'd
point
out
to
the
court
that,
first
of
all,
i
believe
there
is
a
higher
degree
of
protection
in
a
person's
home
than
necessarily
elsewhere;
that
it
certainly
isn't
minimally
intrusive
for
individuals
to
handle
personal
effects.
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
it's
not
reasonable.
what
is,
it
seems
to
us,
invidious
here,
is
that
the
major
basis
for
the
search
is
the
circumstances,
and
the
circumstances
presented
at
the
suppression
hearing.
except
for
the
fact
that
this
was
a
low-rent
apartment,
the
officer
wouldn't
have
had
any
reasonable
suspicion.
to
have
this
mere
suspicion
as
a
basis
for
search
is
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
beyond
any
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court.
the
state,
in
actual
fact,
in
the
court
below,
in
the
trial
court,
never
argued
anything
other
than
the
fact
that
they
believed
that
the
leon
case
should
apply
to
them.
in
other
words,
in
the
trial
court,
that
was
their
large
argument.
when
they
appealed
the
case,
that
was
their
argument,
that
no
matter
what,
that
this
officer
had
relied
on
a
good
faith
belief
that
these
items
were
stolen,
and
therefore,
the
items
should
not
be
suppressed.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
judge
livermore,
in
his
decision
in
the
case,
took
care
of
that
by
saying...
well,
first
of
all,
that
this
wasn't
a
warrant
case;
the
other
thing
being,
you
can't
present
the
fruits
of
an
illegal
search,
or
as
he
put
it,
the
police
cannot
launder
the
fruits
of
their
illegal
search
by
having
a
magistrate
put
some
sort
of
stamp
of
approval
on
it.
based
on
all
that,
we
would
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court.
