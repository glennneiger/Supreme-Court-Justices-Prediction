mrs.
akers,
the
case
that
says,
you
can
search
for
cocaine,
and
it's
okay,
that
sets
a
precedent
that
anybody
with
cocaine
in
his
possession
has
no
privacy.
if
we
in
this
case
say
that
he
can
search
a
tv
set,
then
that
means
that
he
can
search
anybody's
tv
set
under
any
circumstances.
and
i'm
sure
you
don't
want
to
go
that
far.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
the
guilty
person.
i'm
talking
about
the
innocent
person.
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
that
case,
any
innocent
person
with
powder
in
his
room
has
a
chance
of
being
searched,
as
of
right
now.
so
if
we
rule
fully
with
you,
then
anybody
with
a
tv
set
has
a
possibility
that
somebody's
going
to
search
it
for
a
serial
number.
and
you
don't
want
to
go
that
far,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
do.
i
have
trouble...
i
have
trouble
with
you
searching
my
tv
set.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
validates
every
search.
if
you
find
what
you're
looking
for,
it's
a
legal
search.
justice

him
it
was
stolen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
to
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
that
they
can
search
for
a
brand
name?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
serial
number.
i'm
talking
about
brand
name.
you
want
us
to
go
that
far?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
want
to
limit
it
to
serial
number,
which
is
what
you
have
in
this
case.
you
don't
want
to
limit
it
to
that.
you
want
it
to
also
go
to
brand
name.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
give
you
an
easy
one.
he
walked
around
behind
the
television
to
see
the
serial
number.
he
didn't
touch
the
television.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
contraband?
