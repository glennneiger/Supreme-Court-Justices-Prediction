ms.
linda
a.
akers
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question,
can
a
police
officer
who
reasonably
suspects
that
an
object
in
plain
view
is
stolen
make
a
closer
inspection
of
that
item
to
dispel
or
confirm
his
suspicion?
this
question
raises
three
issues.
first
of
all,
is
a
fourth
amendment
privacy
interest
implicated?
secondly,
is
a
fourth
amendment
possessory
interest
implicated?
and
finally,
if
such
a
fourth
amendment
interest
is
implicated,
either
in
the
possessory
aspect
or
in
the
privacy
aspect,
can
an
officer
on
reasonably,
articulable
suspicion,
make
a
closer
inspection
of
that
particular
item.
the
state
submits
that
there
is
no
possessory
interest.
there
is
no
privacy
interest.
and
furthermore,
if
this
court
finds
such
an
interest,
it
is
so
de
minimus
that
an
officer
may
on
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion
make
a
closer
inspection
of
that
item
and
confirm
or
dispel
his
suspicion.
here
officer
nelson,
on
april
18,
1984,
entered
an
apartment,
mr.
hicks'
apartment,
to
investigate
a
shooting.
he
entered
the
apartment
to
look
for
the
assailant,
his
weapon,
and
perhaps
other
injured
parties.
they
found
guns,
a
mask,
drug
paraphernalia.
and
officer
nelson
noticed,
as
he
entered
the
apartment,
a
stereo
that
appeared
to
him
to
be
out
of
context
with
the
mean
surroundings
of
the
apartment.
it
was
on
concrete
block
and
board
shelving.
and
it
appeared
to
him
to
be
too
expensive
for
the
types
of
items,
the
other
items,
that
he
saw
in
the
apartment.
this
raised
a
suspicion
in
his
mind.
he
suspected,
having
seen
the
other
items
that
indicated
the
instrumentalities
of
crime,
that
indicated
to
him
that
a
crime
had
been
committed,
that
perhaps
this
stereo
was
stolen.
he
took
the
serial
number
of
the
stereo
down.
he
called
it
in
to
the
identification
bureau.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
your
honor,
the
record
reflects
that
he
couldn't
recall
if
it
was
underneath
the
stereo
or
behind
the
stereo.
it
was
not
in
plain
view,
so
to
speak,
in
plain
sight.
it
was
not
on
the
front
of
the
stereo.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
he
had
to
move
the
stereo
in
order
to
ascertain
the
serial
number;
that's
correct.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
if
it
was
under
it,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
he
did.
the
government's
position,
however,
is
that
that
is
such
a
de
minimus...
that
inspection
of
a
stereo
unit
already
in
plain
view
is
so
de
minimus
so
as
not
to
raise
further
privacy
interests
in
the
serial
number
in
that
the
only
information
that
can
be
conveyed
from
that
serial
number
is
whether
or
not
the
item
is
stolen.
and
if
it
is
stolen,
then
the
legitimate
privacy
interest
that
would
come
into
play
there
is
not
one
that
society
is
willing
to
recognize.
officer
nelson
called
in
the
number.
it
was
reported
to
him
to
be
stolen
by
a
computer
check.
he
seized
the
stereo,
the
one
that
was
reported
to
him
to
have
been
stolen,
and
took
it
with
them.
he
went
back
to
the
police
station,
pulled
the
robbery
reports,
ascertained
that
the
other
items
that
he
had
seen
there
in
plain
view,
that
he
had
noted
the
serial
numbers
on,
were
also
stolen.
an
affidavit
was
sworn
out
and
a
search
warrant
was
executed.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
your
honor,
if
the
only
information
that
can
be
conveyed
from
that
serial
number
is
whether
or
not
the
stereo
or
whatever
the
appliance
or
item
that
has
a
serial
number
on
it
is
stolen,
then
in
that
respect,
there
is
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy,
and
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply
in
that
respect.
so
if
you
can
ascertain
it
by
aided
sight,
as
you
have
indicated
here,
i
mean,
i
think
you
could
also
draw
an
analogy
if
an
officer
had
glasses
on;
needed
glasses
to
inspect
the
serial
number.
once
he's
legitimately
where
he
has
a
right
to
be...
and
perhaps
that
is
the
threshold
question
that
your
question
raises
here,
is
that--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--in
your
hypothetical,
the
officer
does
not
have
a
right
to
make
the
observation
that
he
makes.
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
be
where
he
can
observe
that
serial
number.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
in
that
case,
then,
we
would
say
that
under
the
fourth
amendment--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--okay,
for
the
purposes
of
whether
or
not
a
legitimate
privacy
interest
has
been
invaded,
that
is
correct.
because
the
only
information
that
can
be
gotten
from
the
serial
number
is
whether
or
not
that
item
is
stolen;
and
that
is
it.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
your
honor,
under
these
circumstances,
the
test
is,
in
texas
v.
brown,
of
whether
the
facts
would
warrant
a
man
of
reasonable
caution
in
the
belief
that
these
items
are
stolen.
on
that
basis,
we
are
very
close
to
probable
cause
here,
but
i
don't
believe
we
had
probable
cause.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
i'm
sorry,
i--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--to
inspect
the
serial
number,
that's
correct.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
you're
saying,
get
a
search
warrant
to
get
the
serial
from
the...
the...
whatever
it
is
that's
stolen?
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
it's
the
state's
position
that
he
does
not
need
a
search
warrant
to
ascertain
what
he
can
ascertain
when
he
is
legitimately
and
lawfully
present.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
and
that
was
the
situation.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
your
honor,
it's
the
position
of
the
state
that
the
fourth
amendment
application
must
be
decided
first
of
all,
because
the
fourth
amendment
is
what
is
involved
here
on
a
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion
case.
in
this
situation,
in
briefing
that,
you
are
quite
correct,
it
was
not
raised
below.
and
we
felt
it
was
encompassed
within
our
question
presented,
because
if
there's
no
fourth
amendment
applicability,
then
we
never
really
reach
the
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion
question.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
in
reviewing
the
cases,
and
especially
united
states
v.
jacobson,
we
could
not
reach
that
determination,
and
felt
it
best
to
brief
the
issue.
in
united
states
v.
jacobson,
this
court
found
that
there
was
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
information
that
could
be
gained
from
testing
a
small
amount
of
white
powder
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
cocaine;
the
only
possible
information
that
could
be
conveyed
through
that
test.
and
in
reading
that
case
and
comparing
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
is,
in
testing
the
serial
number,
all
that
could
be
ascertained
was
whether
or
not
the
stereo
was
stolen,
under
those
circumstances
we
could
not
conclude
that
there
was
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
that
society
was
willing
to
recognize,
ergo
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
application.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
your
honor,
all
we
are
asking
this
court--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--all
we
are
asking
this
court
to
hold
is
that
a
police
officer
may,
on
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion,
examine
the
exterior
of
an
item
if
something
is
revealed
in
plain
view
by--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--your
honor,
that's
entirely
possible,
and
that
would
have
to
be
assessed
under
the
set
of
criteria
that
would
be
available
to
the
officer,
and
if
he
may
then
examine
that
in
plain
view,
if
it's
contraband
or
what
have
you.
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
hold
is
that
we
may
examine
the
exterior
of
an
item
to
determine
the
brand
name
or
serial
number
of
an
item.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
i
don't
believe
you
do,
your
honor,
in
the
respect
that
you
can...
if
this
court
finds
that
you
can
examine
the
exterior
of
an
item
in
plain
view
for
serial
number
or
brand
name,
you
do
not
have
to
encompass,
then...
for
example,
you
mentioned
a
letter.
the
state
does
not
advocate
the
position
that
you
can
read
the
letter
that
would
be
found
under
there,
or
anything
else.
if,
perhaps,
it
was
contraband,
then
it
could
be
seized.
i'm
not
going
to
tell
this
court
that...
that
if
an
officer
sees
contraband,
he
can't
seize
it.
but
i
believe
that
under
these
circumstances
the
petitioner
would
submit
that
he
may
make
that
limited
inspection
on
reasonable
articulable
suspicion.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
he
can.
all
that
we're
asking
this
court
to
hold
is
that
you
may
look
for
the
serial
number
or
the
brand
name,
without
dismantling,
opening,
unplugging,
or
any
other
interference
with
whatever
the
object
is
in
plain
view
that
would
have
the
serial
number
on
it,
in
this
case,
a
stereo.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
your
honor,
i
would
defend
the
unplugging
of
a
stereo,
but
in
this
case,
you
do
not
have
to
reach
that
far.
it's
just
the
examination
of
the
item
for
serial
number
or
brand
name.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
the
problem--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--the
problem
is
that
we
come
into
cases
like
this
where
we
have
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion,
which
i
believe
is
a
standard
that
the
courts
can
employ
to
protect
the
fourth
amendment
interests
of
an
individual,
where
the
item
itself
is
already
in
plain
view;
it
has
already
been
subject
to
visibility
by
a
police
officer,
and
that's
unquestioned
here.
it's
conceded
that
the
exigent
circumstances
that
brought
the
officer
into
the
apartment
was
such
that
the
officer
could
look
around
him
and
observe
the
items
within
the
apartment.
and
those
included,
as
i
said
before,
guns,
masks,
instrumentalities
of
crime.
there
were
incriminating
objects
already
present.
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
officer,
he
believed
he
had
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion,
as
the
record
reflects--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--no,
your
honor,
you
would
not.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we're
not
advocating
that
position.
we're
only
advocating--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--for
the
reason...
no,
i
am
sure
about
unplugging,
and
i
would
defend
that
to
this
court.
but
that's
not
this
case.
and
i
would
defend
the...
the
taking
of
the
serial
number
from
the
stereo,
but
the
problems
raised
by
the
opening
of
the
stereo
unit
are
the
same
as
justice
stevens
has
alluded
to
here,
which
is,
whatever
you
find
underneath
may
be
an
additional
problem.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
to
this
court
is,
the
police
are
in
great
need
of
flexible
standards
by
which
they
may
respond
to
those
things
that
they
see
in
their
everyday
investigations.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
no,
your
honor--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--the
trial--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--the
trial
court's
finding,
i
believe,
was
not
clear;
i
agree
with
you
in
that
respect.
but
it
seemed
to
be
focussed
on
the
immediately
apparent
aspect,
that
is,
that
he
could
not
look
at
the
object
and
immediately
ascertain
that
it
was
stolen.
and
in
light
of
that,
the
court
held
that
you
did
not
meet...
he
did
not
meet,
the
state
did
not
meet
the
third
prong
of
the
coolidge
test,
which
was
the
test
that
the
trial
court
employed.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
had...
the
record
is
replete
with
an
indication
by
the
officer
that
he
believed,
he
had
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion,
in
other
words,
that
the
object
was
stolen.
and
i
believe
it's
like
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
in
that
respect,
and
that
this
court
may
review
the
record
that
is
presented
to
you.
and
in
applying
the
law...
applying
the
law
as
this
court
finds
it,
may
so
find
that
there
was
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
on
the
record
we
have
presented
to
you,
even
though
the
trial
court
focussed
on
the
immediately
apparent
aspect
of
that
stereo,
and
how
the
officer
viewed
it
under
that
particular
test.
even
if
this
court
finds--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
apply
the
same
test
to
a
situation
such
as
you
have
described.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
if
the
examination
of
the
stereo
for
the
serial
would
reveal
such
information,
then
i
would
not
make
a
distinction
between
an
instrumentality,
fruit
of
a
crime,
or
contraband.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
or
evidence.
if
that
information...
and
i
agree
with
you,
i
can't
think
of
an
instance
where
it
would.
because
the
only
information
that
is
to
be
garnered
from
this
serial
number
is
whether
or
not
it
is
listed
in
the
computer
banks,
ncic,
the
national
computer--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--another
item
with--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--a
different
serial
number
could
indeed
reveal
that
information,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
the
ironic
thing
is,
i
believe,
under
the
status
of
the
laws
that
exist,
under
terry
v.
ohio,
that
an
officer
could
stop
you,
that
is
seize
your
person
briefly
and
momentarily,
to
ascertain
some
identification
and
explanation
from
you
if
he
has
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion,
or
reason
to
suspect
that
you
and
that
stereo
are
evidence
of
some
crime
or
criminal
activity.
so
i
think
in
that
respect
you
can
accost
a
person
on
the
street,
which
is
a
much
greater
intrusion,
and
ask
for
its
identification;
but
you
cannot
get
the
identifying
marks
off
of
a
stereo,
which
is
an
inanimate
object,
and
seemingly,
a
much
lesser
intrusion.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
absolutely,
your
honor;
once
they
are
lawfully
present.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
your
honor,
if
in
the
course
of
executing
a
search
warrant,
an
officer
has
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion
to
believe
that
something
else
he
may
come
across,
and
in
this
situation,
justice
stevens,
guns
may
come
into
play
here,
where
i
am
aware
of
cases
where
officers
have
executed
drug
search
warrants
and
found
an
arsenal,
70,
80
guns.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
in
that
situation,
i
believe
that
given
the
criminality
that
the
officer
may
see--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--he
might
be
able
to...
and
he
could
reasonably
articulate
it,
that
he
should
be
able
to
inspect
those
guns
for
the
serial
number,
and
ascertain
whether
or
not
they
are
lawfully
maintained
or
possessed
by
the
person
who
has...
wherever
he's
executing
the
warrant.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
under
united
states
v.
jacobson,
that
the...
testing
the
white
powder,
and
the
consuming
of
the
white
powder
in
the
test
does
not...
has
been
found
by
this
court
to
be
a
de
minimus
intrusion
on
the
possessory
interest
of
the
person
who
owns
the
white
powder.
and
in
so
finding,
this
court
found
that...
in
so
finding
this
court
has
concluded
that
there
is
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
or
possession
in
the
powder
that
is
revealed
by
the
tests.
so
that,
in
this
case,
if
we
draw
the
direct
analogy
that
we
have
here,
we
do
not
advance...
or
we
do
not
regress
upon
any
fourth
amendment
protections,
any
more
than
we've
had
under
united
states
v.
jacobson.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
all
the
officer
could
tell
was
that
they
had
a
white
powder
that
someone
was
very
interested
in
keeping
protected.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
in
that
case,
it
might
well
have
been,
your
honor,
that
the
officer
viewing
the
white
powder,
and
the
circumstances
in
which
the
white
powder
was
encased,
that
is,
the
several
boxes
and
the
tube;
but
they
did
not
know
conclusively
that
it
was
cocaine.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
any
more
than
in
this
case
he
suspected
that
it
was
stolen.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
i
would
disagree
with
your
honor--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--in
the
respect
that
in
this
case
there
were
instrumentalities
of
crime
that
had
been
found
in
this
apartment,
masks,
guns--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--your
honor,
this
court
found
probable
cause,
but
i--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--that's
true,
but
we're
within
a
gnat's
eyelash
of
probable
cause
in
this
case.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
that
is
true,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
but
i
believe
this...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
i
believe
this
will
eventually
be
subjected
to
judicial
scrutiny
in
the
respect
that
this
information
can
be
challenged
in
a
court
of
law
in
determining
the
admissibility
of
whatever
the
evidence
is
against
the
individual.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
same
interest
in
stolen
property,
it's
the
same
illegitimate
interest
in
contraband
or
in
stolen
property.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
if,
your
honor--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--your
honor,
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
going
that
far,
because
i
don't
think
the
interest
in--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
information
that
could
be
conveyed
from
the
exterior,
and
calling
it
a
search...
i'm
not
conceding
that
it
is
a
search...
but
the
inspection
of
the
television
set
i
don't
believe
reveals
any
information
other
than
whether
or
not
the
item
is
stolen;
and
that
you
have,
and
anyone
else
has,
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
area.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
no,
your
honor--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--i
disagree
with
your
conclusion
in
the
respect...
and
petitioner
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
examination
of
the
exterior
of
an
item
in
plain
view
that
reveals
only
the
serial
or
the
brand
name,
which
assists
the
officer
in
determining
whether
or
not
it
is
stolen,
is
not
an
intrusion
that--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--well,
your
honor,
the
only
hypothesis
i
can
think
of
on
that
situation
is
if
an
officer
knew
that
a
television
had
been
stolen
within,
say,
the
same
apartment
complex,
and
that
he
knew
it
was
a
particular
brand,
perhaps
an
rca;
and
by
determining
the
brand
name,
then
that
would
focus
it
more
on
the
television
as
opposed
to
just
any
television
set.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
yes;
a
brand
name
or
a
serial
number.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
or
a
serial
number,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
you
honor,
i
think--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--in
this
case,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
go
that
far.
however,
brand
name
is
the
same
kind
of
information
that
is
encompassed
within
the
serial
number.
in
united
states
v.
place,
this
court
found
that
the
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
dog
sniff
of
a
suitcase
on
reasonable
suspicion
was
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
because
officers
were
in
need
of
a
flexible
array
of
means
to
respond
to
suspected
criminal
activity.
and
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
case
can
be
controlled
by
the
principles
in
united
states
versus
place,
and
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
finding
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation
here.
i'd
like
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
briefly.
in
response
to
questions
that
the
respondent
received,
there
are
some
eight
circumstances
that
appear
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
the
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion
that
the
officer
had.
first
of
all,
there
were
guns
that
they
found.
a.45
caliber
gun,
a.25
caliber
gun,
and
a.22
caliber
rifle.
masks.
the
stereo
was
on
a
temporary
shelving,
concrete
block
and
wood.
the
experience
of
the
officer:
he
had
12
years
of
experience,
and
he
knew
that
stereos
were
frequently
the
subject
of
property
crimes.
he
had
heard
the
name
of
one
of
the
occupants
of
the
apartment
as
being
an
individual
who
was
involved
in
a
criminal
investigation.
there
was
a
shooting,
and
indeed,
an
injury,
just
shortly
before
the
officer
came
into
this
apartment;
that
is,
more
criminal
activity.
and
there
was
drug
paraphernalia
all
around
the
apartment.
i
believe
that
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
test
is
reasonableness,
and
that
is
the
final
test.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
in
a
terry
stop,
the
individual
can
be
stopped
under
suspicion
for
identification
and
information,
or
response
to
questions
about
the
suspected
criminal
activity.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
and
that
is
encompassed
within
the
serial
number
of
the
stereo
unit,
as
opposed
to...
i
mean,
an
inanimate
object
doesn't
respond
to
questions,
so
he
wouldn't
have
the
option,
i
guess,
of
not
responding.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
if
he
has
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion
that
there's
criminal
afoot,
then
he
could
investigate
that
criminal
activity,
and
if
it
involved
a
stereo,
he
could.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
then
at
that
point--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--either
arrest
him,
or
decide
that
the
information
that
he
had
and
the
information
that
he
got
from
the
suspect
was
such
that
he
didn't
feel
that
it
should
be
pursued
further.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
yes,
your
honor,
if
he's
refusing--
ms.
linda
a.
akers
--the
articulable
suspicion
will
allow
him
to
do
the
further
investigation,
which
is
to
stop
the
man
and
ask
him
the
questions
that
you
have
proposed.
ms.
linda
a.
akers
and
if
he
gets
a
"no"
or
answers
that
do
not
lead
him
to
a
logical
conclusion,
that
he
can
explain
his
presence
at
the
suspected
criminal
activity,
the
scene,
wherever
he
is,
then
in
that
circumstance,
that
could
be
considered
by
the
officer
in
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
to
arrest
or
not.
