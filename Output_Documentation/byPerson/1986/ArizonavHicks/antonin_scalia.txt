justice

scalia
suppose
the
government
sets
up
a
monster
telescope
across
the
street
from
my
house
and
looked
through
my
window
to
do
nothing
else
except
get
the
stereo
number
off
of
a
stereo
in
my
room.
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
assuming
that
they
have
no
business
being
in
my
house.
and
if
a
telescope
won't
do
it,
it's
some
fancy
electronic
technique
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
sight,
but
it
reaches
into
my
apartment
and
derives
the
serial
number
of
my
stereo.
and
you
say
that's...
that's
okay,
because
that's
not
very
important
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why?
you
could
say
just
as
much
in
that
case:
what's
the
big
deal
about
a
serial
number?
it's
not
very
important.
i
mean,
that's
the
argument
you
were
running.
that
the
search
here
is
okay
because
the
serial
number
is
not
important.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
important
or
not,
does
it,
for
purposes
of
whether
there's
been
a
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
"to
determine"?
you're
asking
us
to
evaluate
the
intrusiveness
of
a
search
on
the
basis
of
what
happens
to
be
found,
on
the
basis
of
what
is
being
looked
for
and
what
happens
to
be
found.
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
point
of
justice
stevens'
question
that
its
intrusiveness
does
not
necessarily
depend
either
upon
what
you're
looking
for
or
on
what
you
in
fact
find;
it
depends
on
what
you
might
find.
there
might
be
a
private
letter
under
there,
or
when
you
lift
it
up,
there
may
be
something
else
on
the
top
of
the
table.
don't
you
have
to
consider
that
in
deciding
how
intrusive
this
activity
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
get
into
that
kind
of
question,
though,
once
we
accept
what
you
want
us
to
accept
here.
that
is,
you
have
to
decide,
well,
what
if
you
turn
it
over?
what
if
you
move
the
table
it's
on?
what
if
you
unplug?
it's
rather
a
nice,
clear
line
to
say
that
plain
view
means
plain
view.
you
walk
in
there,
you
don't
disrupt
anything,
whatever
you
see
you
can
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
that
great
advantage,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
it's
only
a
serial
number.
and
you're
not
sure
about
unplugging?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i'm
walking
down
the
street
with
a
stereo
under
my
arm,
could
a
police
officer
come
over
to
me
and
say,
turn
that
stereo
around,
i
want
to
check
the
serial
number
on
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
argument
is
that
once
the
police
are
lawfully
in
my
apartment,
that
they
ought
to
be
able
to
do
the
same
thing
to
the
stereo
that
they
would
be
able
to
do
on
the
street,
were
i
walking
about
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
that
basis,
you
couldn't
do
a
terry
stop--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
somebody
who
is,
i
don't
know,
wearing
baggy
pants,
and
obviously
secondhand
clothes,
walking
down
the
street
carrying
a...
gee,
i
don't
know...
pick
the
most
expensive
piece
of
personal
property
you
can
imagine,
and
this
person
is
carrying
it
on
his
shoulders,
and
you
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
should
not
think
that
somebody
who
dresses
in
shabby
clothes
can't
own
the
best
stereo
in
the
world.
that's
sort
of
silly,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
reasonable...
isn't
that
a
reasonable
situation
to
raise
a
suspicion?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
stopping
a
rich
man
who's
carrying
something
that's
thought
stolen
and
normally
belongs
to
poor
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
disparity,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
both
are
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
your
case
depend
on
my
agreeing
with
you
that
there
has
been,
not
just
a
search
here,
but
a
seizure?
do
i
have
to
agree
with
you
that
when
you
copy
down
the
number
of
a
stereo,
you
are
seizing
that
number?
i
mean,
he
didn't
actually
rip
off
the
label
and
take
it
out
with
him
or
anything,
right?
all
he
did
was
write
it
down?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
contend
that
that's
a
seizure,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
don't
agree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
case
would
be
the
same
if
there's
just
a
search
but
no
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
case
would
be
the
same
if
it
was
just
an
unlawful
search
with
no
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
fruit
of
the
search,
to
wit--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
knowledge
of
the
serial
number,
would
be
excluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
great
relief,
because
it
doesn't
look
like
a
seizure
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
couldn't
you
do
it
on
the
street?
let's
assume
that
i
would
think
that
a
terry
stop
here
would
have
been
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
seeing
somebody
walking
down
the
street
and
obviously--
justice
antonin
scalia
--walking
briskly.
somebody
walking
briskly,
pretty
shabbily
dressed,
carrying,
you
know,
a
very
spiffy
stereo.
do
you
think
the
policeman
would
be
able
to
stop
him
and
say,
excuse
me
there,
young
fellow,
where
are
you
going
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
he...
could
he
ask
for
the
identification
number
of
the
stereo?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could
ask?
if
the
fellow
said,
no,
he
couldn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
could
ask
the
person
to
turn
the
stereo
around,
if
the
person
said,
sure.
but
he
couldn't
require
him
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mrs.
akers,
what
do
you
answer
to
mr.
rood's
point
that
even
if
you
can
persuade
us
that
this
is
analogous
to
a
terry
stop,
all
that
you'd
be
allowed
to
do
on
the
basis
of
an
articulable
suspicion
in
a
terry
stop
is
ask
for
the
individual's
name,
ask
him
to
identify
himself
and
give
an
account
of
why
he's
there
or
whatever?
that
individual
is
entitled
to
say,
none
of
your
business,
right?
at
which
point
the
officer
would
have
to
either
decide
that
he
has
enough
probable
cause
to
arrest
or
let
him
go.
you
couldn't
ask
somebody
on
a
terry
search,
could
you,
to
let
me
see
the
name
of
this
fancy...
on
the
label
of
the
fancy
jacket
that
you're
wearing?
i
mean,
you
could
ask
him.
but
if
he
said
no,
the
officer
wouldn't
have
the
ability
to
open
the
jacket,
would
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
what
if
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
supposing
he's
carrying
a
stereo
on
his
shoulder.
could
you
stop
him
and
demand
that
he
show
you
the
identification
number
of
the
stereo?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
individual
says,
no,
i
won't
turn
it
around.
the
serial
number's
on
my
shoulder,
i'm
not
going
to
show
it
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
can
the
officer
do
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
to
arrest
him,
he
would
need
probable
cause,
wouldn't
he?
not
just
an
articulable
suspicion?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
an
articulable
suspicion
does
not
get
him
the
identification
number?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
he
gets
a
"no",
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
arizona.
the
essential
facts
are
as
follows.
a
bullet
was
fired
through
the
floor
of
hicks'
apartment,
injuring
a
man
in
the
room
below.
police
entered
the
apartment
to
search
for
the
shooter,
for
other
victims,
and
for
weapons.
they
found
and
seized
three
weapons
including
a
sawed-off
riffle
and
saw
in
one
of
the
rooms
a
stocking-cap
mask.
one
of
the
policemen,
officer
nelson,
noticed
two
sets
of
expensive
stereo
components
which
seemed
out
of
place
in
what
was
otherwise
an
ill-appointed
apartment.
suspecting
that
these
components
were
stolen
he
moved
some
of
them
in
order
to
read
and
record
their
serial
numbers
and
reported
these
numbers
by
phone
to
his
headquarters.
after
learning
that
one
of
them,
the
turntable
had
been
taken
in
an
armed
robbery
he
seized
it.
when
hicks
was
indicted
for
the
robbery
the
state
trial
court
granted
his
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
that
had
been
seized
as
a
consequence
of
the
discovery
of
the
turntable's
serial
number.
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
this
court
the
state
has
conceded
that
prior
to
disturbing
the
turntable,
officer
nelson
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
believe
it
had
been
stolen.
we
therefore
do
not
consider
that
issue.
the
state
asserts
however
that
officer
nelson
did
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
and
that
this
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
fourth
amendment,
in
light
of
the
minimal
intrusion
on
hicks'
privacy
that
the
search
produced.
the
reasons
discussed
in
the
filed
opinion,
we
hold
that
probable
cause
is
required
for
search
of
an
object
that
lawfully
comes
within
a
police
officer's
plain
view,
just
as
it
would
be
required
for
its
seizure.
and
we
hold
that
the
moving
of
stereo
equipment
to
expose
to
view
what
had
been
concealed
constituted
a
search.
we
reject
the
concept
of
some
third
category
of
police
action
between
search
and
non
search
which
can
be
justified
on
a
basis
less
than
probable
cause.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion

which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined;
