we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
85-1433,
gloria
richardson
against
clarissa
marsh.
mr.
baughman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
baughman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
state
didn't
have
to
rely
on
the
confession
to
put
the
defendant
in
the
car.
she
admitted
she
was
there
by
her
own
testimony.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baughman.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
whalen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
from
your
point
of
view
you
have
to
say
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
evidence
given
by
the
defendant
herself
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
only
a
linkage
by
implication,
whereas
your
client
testified
in
fact
she
was
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
isn't
just
an
inference;
it's
a
fact.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
your
client
request
a
severance
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
life
goes
on
in
philadelphia,
too,
doesn't
it,
where
they
don't
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
daresay
the
citizens
scarcely
know
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
i
suppose
people
on
the
other
side
would
say
that
the
third
circuit
rule
is
equally
"workable".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
that
be?
bruton
said
that
redaction
was
probably
okay.
and
if
you
have
a
rule
that
applies
in
hindsight
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
you
just
invite
reversals,
retrials.
you
know,
let's
figure
out
whether
the
person
is
guilty
or
innocent,
get
them
tried,
get
that
case
on,
and
get
to
another
case,
rather
than
these
endless
inquiries
that
your
rule
would
require.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
you're
saying
that
it's
argued
on
both
sides
different
rules
could
be
adopted,
and
you're
opting
for
a
rule
which
would
be
applied
by
hindsight
at
the
close
of
the
trial,
when
the
severance
decision
is
made
before
trial,
the
prosecutor's
decisions
as
to
introducing
evidence
are
made
at
the
beginning
of
trial.
and
so
it
isn't
a
bright
line
rule
at
all.
it's
simply,
how
did
everything
work
out,
and
no
one
knows
in
advance
how
it'll
all
work
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
raise
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
the
michigan
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
did
they
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
whalen.
mr.
baughman,
i
think
you
have
some
time
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baughman.
the
case
is
submitted.
