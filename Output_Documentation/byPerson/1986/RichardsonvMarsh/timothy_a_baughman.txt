mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
constitutional
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
respondent's
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
her
was
violated
at
her
joint
trial
with
benjamin
williams.
primarily
the
question
is
whether
or
not
benjamin
williams,
through
the
admission
of
his
redacted
confession,
became
a
witness
against
respondent.
put
another
way,
the
question
is
whether
the
ordinary
presumption
that
jurors
can
understand
and
will
follow
instructions
should
be
put
aside
in
this
case
in
favor
of
a
presumption
that
the
jurors
here
disregarded
two
strong
limiting
instructions
that
williams'
confession
was
not
to
be
considered
against
respondent.
now,
the
facts
very
briefly
put
are
these.
some
eight
years
ago,
as
the
culmination
of
a
robbery,
ollie
scott,
her
niece
cynthia
knighton,
and
cynthia
knighton's
four
year
old
son
koran
knighton
were
taken
to
the
basement
of
the
scott
home
to
be
executed.
koran
knighton
and
ollid
scott
were
shot
to
death.
cynthia
knighton,
though
shot
three
times,
lived
and
testified.
the
trial
was
a
joint
trial
with
benjamin
williams
and
clarissa
marsh.
kareem
martin
remained
at
large
at
this
time,
he
was
the
third
participant.
williams
had
confessed
and
the
confession
was
redacted
to
remove
all
reference
to
clarissa
marsh.
from
the
confession
as
admitted,
one
would
not
know
that
any
other
individual,
any
third
person,
was
involved
in
any
way
in
this
crime.
at
the
time
of
the
admission
of
the
confession
into
evidence,
the
trial
judge
gave
a
limiting
instruction
including
a
statement,
to
the
jurors
that
to
consider
the
confession
against
respondent
would
be
most
unfair
and
a
violation
of
their
oath
as
jurors.
he
repeated
this
instruction
at
the
time
of
his
full
charge
to
the
jury
before
deliberations.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
found
no
confrontation
violation
in
the
admission
of
the
confession,
relying
on
united
states
versus
bell,
a
case
also
cited
in
our
brief.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
however,
disagreed,
finding
that
there
was
constitutional
error
in
this
case.
that
court
found
that
the
confession
as
redacted
was
powerfully
incriminating
of
respondent
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
her
testimony.
particularly,
the
court
found
that
the
confession
was
powerfully
incriminating
in
that
respondent's
testimony
placed
her
in
the
vehicle
with
martin
and
williams
at
a
time
in
which
the
confession
indicated
williams
and
martin
discussed
the
plan
to
rob
the
house
and
kill
the
occupants.
the
court
therefore
held
that
the
jury
could
not
be
trusted
to
follow
the
limiting
instructions
and
that,
since
williams
did
not
testify
and
respondent
was
unable
to
cross-examine
him
as
to
what
went
on
in
the
car,
confrontation
rights
were
violated.
we
believe
that
this
holding
extends
bruton
beyond
its
limits.
it's
very
difficult,
when
asking
whether
the
jury
followed
instructions
in
a
particular
set
of
circumstances,
to
raise
the
level
of
the
inquiry
beyond
that
of
yes,
they
did,
or
no,
they
didn't,
because
we
really
have
no
way
of
knowing
for
certain.
we
believe
that
it
is
necessary,
therefore,
to
engage
in
a
systems
analysis
which
involves
the
indulgence
of
certain
presumptions.
we
venerate
trial
by
jury
in
our
system
of
justice,
and
i
believe
rightly
so.
trial
by
jury
is
perhaps
the
cornerstone
of
our
view
of
the
trial
as
a
truth-seeking
adventure,
interposing
as
it
does
between
the
government
on
the
one
hand,
including
the
judiciary,
and
the
accused
on
the
other
community
fact
finders.
but
the
jurors
as
community
fact
finders
must
find
the
facts
within
the
context
of
the
law
as
given
them
by
the
trial
judge,
including
instructions
on
such
things
as
the
nature
of
the
accusation,
the
burden
of
proof,
the
standard
of
proof,
and
in
many
circumstances
the
limited
consideration
that
the
jurors
are
to
give
to
certain
evidence
which
has
been
admitted.
our
theory
of
justice
relies
upon
the
jury
to
follow
all
of
these
instructions.
because
we
rightly
forbid
a
post-trial
inquiry
into
the
character
of
the
jury
deliberations,
it
must
be
presumed,
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions,
that
jurors
are
conscious
of
the
gravity
of
their
task,
attend
closely
to
particular
language
of
the
judge's
instructions
in
a
criminal
case,
and
strive
to
understand,
make
sense
of,
and
apply
those
instructions.
the
entire
concept
of
limited
admissibility,
which
is
codified
in
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
as
well
as
in
the
michigan
rules
of
evidence,
presumes
that
jurors
will
follow
instructions
to
put
certain
evidence
to
a
particular
permissible
purpose,
or
in
some
cases
to
consider
it
only
against
one
of
several
parties.
and
we
apply
these
presumptions
in
very
difficult
circumstances.
for
example,
it
may
well
be
that
in
a
case
a
confession
has
been
taken
from
the
defendant
and
yet
is
suppressed
because
it
was
obtained
in
violation
of
miranda.
however,
if
that
same
confession
is
found
to
be
voluntary,
under
the
rule
of
harris
versus
new
york
it
may
be
admitted
for
its
impeachment
value
of
the
defendant's
testimony.
in
that
case
then,
the
jury
will
hear
the
very
confession
of
the
defendant
him
or
herself
as
to
their
guilt
in
the
crime
charged
before
the
court,
and
yet
be
instructed
to
consider
that
confession,
not
as
to
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
only
as
to
the
testimonial
credibility
of
the
accused.
if
the
jury
fails
to
follow
that
instruction,
that
confession,
the
defendant's
own
confession,
will
certainly
be
powerfully
incriminating
of
the
accused,
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
yet
we
presume
that
the
jury
will
follow
the
instruction
and
has
the
capacity
to
follow
those
instructions.
other
examples
are
given,
i
believe,
in
the
solicitor's
brief
as
well.
this
court
has
in
fact
declined
to
disregard,
to
set
aside,
the
presumption
that
jurors
follow
instructions
only
very
rarely.
in
jackson
v.
denno
this
court
held
that
the
jury
could
not
be
entrusted
with
the
responsibility
of
determining
whether
the
defendant's
confession
is
voluntary
and
then
be
expected
to,
in
the
event
the
jury
found
the
confession
was
involuntary,
put
aside
that
confession
on
the
question
of
the
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence,
even
under
instructions
to
do
so.
a
second
circumstance
where
this
court
has
found
that
the
presumption
should
be
set
aside
is
bruton
itself,
where
this
court
held
that
where
the
non-testifying
defendant's
confession
or
a
co-defendant's
confession
is
powerfully
incriminating
of
the
accused,
the
jury
cannot
be
trusted
to
follow
the
limiting
instruction.
we
submit
that
bruton
should
be
limited
to
factual
situations
akin
to
its
own
facts.
in
bruton,
the
accused...
the
co-defendant's
confession
was
powerfully
incriminating
of
bruton
because
it
named
him
in
his
role
in
the
crime
there
charged.
it
was
therefore
powerfully
incriminating,
this
court
held,
and
because
of
that
the
jury
could
not
follow
the
limiting
instruction.
and
the
court
noted
as
an
important
element
of
this
conclusion
the
fact
that
statements
from
co-defendants
incriminating
the
accused
are
looked
upon
as
unreliable,
given
the
recognized
motivation
of
the
co-defendant
to
shift
blame.
confrontation
rights
are
thus
violated
when
the
accused...
when
the
co-defendant
does
not
testify.
however,
when
the
factual
context
is
different
this
court
has
found
that
bruton
does
not
apply.
the
plurality
of
this
court
in
parker
v.
randolph
found
that
the
bruton
exception
has
no
application
where
the
defendant
him
or
herself
has
also
confessed
and
confessed
in
a
manner
which
is
consistent
with
or
interlocks
with
the
co-defendant's
confession.
in
that
circumstance,
this
court
said
that
the
danger
that
the
jury
will
disregard
the
cautionary
instruction
is
lessened
significantly,
for
the
jury
has
before
it
the
defendant's
own
confession
upon
which
to
focus.
we
submit
that
our
system
of
trial
by
jury
requires
that
the
presumption
that
jurors
are
capable
of
following
instructions
not
be
cast
aside
except
in
the
most
compelling
of
circumstances,
and
that
bruton
represents
the
outer
limit
of
how
far
this
court
should
go
in
that
regard.
the
sixth
circuit
recognized
in
this
case
a
doctrine
of
evidentiary
linkage
or
contextual
implication,
and
we
believe
that
this
expands
the
bruton
doctrine
substantially.
in
bruton
we
have
a
confession
which
not
only
mentioned
the
co-defendant,
but
mentioned
him
directly.
in
contrast
to
that
situation,
we
have
here
a
confession
which
doesn't
mention
the
respondent
directly,
indeed
which
does
not
even
indicate
that
a
third
person
was
in
any
way
involved
in
the
criminal
event.
standing
alone,
the
confession
in
bruton
was
powerfully
incriminating
of
bruton.
standing
alone,
the
confession
in
this
case
is
not
incriminating
of
the
respondent
one
whit.
moreover,
in
bruton
this
court,
as
i
indicated,
referred
to
the
unreliability
of
co-defendant's
statements
due
to
the
recognized
motivation
to
shift
blame,
which
was
an
important
peg
of
this
court's
holding
in
bruton.
for
reasons
largely
given
in
part
two
of
our
brief,
i
submit
that
in
this
case
we
have
a
different
situation.
it
is
not
entirely
accurate
to
state
as
a
blanket
rule
that
co-defendants'
confessions
are
unreliable
because
they
shift
blame.
some
are
and
some
aren't.
some
shift
blame
and
some
don't.
some
lay
the
responsibility
for
certain
blame,
but
it
is
not
blame-shifting
as
we
might
refer
to
it.
it
is
an
accurate
reporting
of
the
events.
under
this
court's
confrontation
cases...
lee
v.
illinois
is
a
recent
one...
this
court
has
recognized
that
it
is
possible
for
a
co-defendant's
confession
to
be
reliable,
and
we
submit
that
the
confession
in
this
case
was
in
fact
reliable.
so
that
peg
of
bruton,
as
well
as
the
directly
incriminatory
peg
of
bruton,
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
it
is
not
my
argument
that,
while
jurors
are
capable
of
following
limiting
instructions
in
some
very,
very
difficult
circumstances,
they
are
incapable
of
putting
inferences
together.
i
would
concede
that
it
is
possible
for
jurors
to
take
redacted
confessions
and
take
other
testimony
and
figure
out
that
there
might
be
some
inculpatory
inference
when
the
two
were
taken
together.
but
that's
not
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
jurors
will
regard
an
instruction
not
to
draw
that
inference
or
not
to
give
it
any
weight
in
their
deliberations.
in
every
circumstance
of
limited
admissibility,
the
question
we
ask--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--yes,
i
will,
your
honor.
in
every
circumstance
of
limited
admissibility,
we
do
not
ask
the
question
of
whether
the
jury
is
capable
of
drawing
the
impermissible
inference
or
putting
the
evidence
to
the
impermissible
use.
we
give
them
an
instruction
so
they
will
not
do
that.
if
we
did
not
think
they
had
the
capacity,
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
instruction.
this
case
presents
a
different
situation,
we
submit,
from
one
where
the
confession
itself
powerfully
incriminates
the
defendant.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
about
the
prosecutor's
argument.
let
me
first
address
that
directly
and
then
i
have
a
further
point
to
make
regarding
it.
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
i
believe
did
make
a
comment
about
respondent's
testimony.
she
did
choose
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
that
she
was
in
the
vehicle
with
williams
and
martin,
in
the
back
seat,
she
testified,
with
the
radio
on
and,
though
there
was
conversation
going
on
between
williams
and
martin,
she
did
not
know
what
it
was.
the
petitioner
as
a
preface
to
his
lengthy
argument
as
to
how
the
jury
could
discern
respondent's
involvement
in
the
crime
commented
on
that
testimony
by
saying:
respondent
said
these
things,
and
of
course
she
said
them;
it's
in
her
interest
to
say
that
she
did
not
hear
the
conversation.
he
then
said:
but
how
else
do
we
know
she's
involved
in
the
plan,
in
the
crime;
and
then
proceeded,
with
some
vigor
and
quite
a
bit
of
detail,
to
explain
how
apart
from
that
the
jury
could
know
that
the
respondent
was
involved.
she
did
not
act
surprised
when
martin
pulled
a
gun
in
the
house.
she
took
a
position
of
a
lookout
by
the
door
at
that
time.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
there's
no
other
evidence
of
that
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
think
not,
and
particularly
given
the
nature
of
the
charge
in
this
case.
the
charge
here
was
felony
murder,
which
does
not
require
either
the
intent
to
kill
or
premeditation.
it
requires
what
would
amount
to
a
second
degree
murder,
which
requires
malice,
the
intent
to
kill,
do
great
bodily
harm,
or
wanton,
willful
disregard.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
had
she
not,
there
would
have
been
no
evidence
that
she
was
in
the
car.
the
linking
testimony
in
this
case
is
her
own
testimony.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
the
confession
was
the
only
evidence
of
the
conversation
in
the
car
and
what
its
contents
were,
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that...
it
is
credible.
the
jury
could
believe
that
if
they
so
chose.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct,
we
don't
know.
but
again,
my
point
would
be
that,
particularly
given
the
nature
of
the
charge
in
this
case,
the
evidence
from
cynthia
knighton
as
to
respondent's
participation
in
the
crime
was
more
than
adequate
to
convict
her
of
felony
murder.
indeed,
if
it
was
not
this
case
should
have
resulted
in
either
a
directed
verdict
or
a
reversal
for
insufficiency.
there
had
to
be
evidence
independent
of
the
confession
to
support
this
conviction,
and
there
was
in
this
case.
i
would
also
point
out
that
i
would
view
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument
really
as
a
different
issue
than
the
confrontation
issue.
the
question
would
be
whether
the
prosecutor
may
have
committed
constitutional
error
in
his
closing
argument,
which
he
could
do
even
if
the
confession
on
its
face
in
no
way,
even
with
other
evidence,
implicated
the
respondent.
the
prosecutor
could
err
in
the
use
put
to
the
confession
in
his
closing
argument,
and
in
that
regard
there
was
no
objection
made
to
that
statement
by
the
prosecutor.
it
was
never
raised.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
absolutely.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
if
there
had
never
been
a
confession
in
this
case
by
anyone,
cynthia
knighton's
testimony
would
have
been
ample
to
convict
her
of
the
crime.
finally,
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
point
out
that
it
is
my
view
that,
even
if
the
presumption
that
jurors
can
and
will
follow
instructions
is
viewed
as
overcome
in
this
case,
that
is
not
in
and
of
itself
a
finding
that
the
constitution
was
violated.
it
is
a
finding
that
benjamin
williams
became
a
witness
against
respondent.
under
this
court's
confrontation
cases,
lee
v.
illinois
being
the
one
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
further
question
remains
in
order
to
find
constitutional
error
of
whether
or
not
the
uncross-examined
confession
of
williams,
even
if
admitted
against
respondent,
violated
confrontation
principles.
we
would
submit
that
even
if
the
jury
considered
the
confession
as
redacted
substantively,
disregarded
the
instruction,
that
constitutional
confrontation
principles
would
not
be
violated
because
the
statement
is
reliable
under
this
court's
cases,
again
lee
v.
illinois
being
the
principal
one.
the
confession
was
devastating
to
mr.
williams.
he
admitted
that
he
was
part
of
a
preconceived
plan
to
rob
the
dwelling
and
to
kill
the
victims.
he
was
given
a
gun
by
martin
and
had
one
himself.
he
does
say
that
it
was
not
himself,
but
martin,
that
carried
out
shootings.
but
that
testimony
is
corroborated
by
cynthia
knighton.
that
is
not
blame-shifting;
it
is
an
accurate
reporting
of
what
went
on.
in
large
regard,
the
confession
is
corroborated
by
cynthia
knighton's
testimony.
the
only
point
in
which
the
confession
is
unreliable,
we
believe,
is
where
williams
states
that
he
was
not
present
in
the
basement
when
the
shootings
occurred.
that
is
inconsistent
with
cynthia
knighton's
testimony
and
we
believe
to
be
that
is
untrue.
but
that
attempt
to
curry
favor
on
the
part
of
williams
in
his
confession
in
no
way
reduced
his
culpability
for
the
events,
nor
did
it
diminish
the
reliability
of
the
rest
of
his
statement,
again
corroborated
in
large
part
by
cynthia
knighton.
so
we
believe
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
lee
v.
illinois
and
that,
even
if
benjamin
williams
is
viewed
as
a
witness
against
respondent,
for
him
to
be
a
witness
against
respondent
through
his
redacted
confession
is
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution
in
this
case.
in
conclusion,
we
believe
that--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--it
was
not
made
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no.
this
case
was
tried
in
1978,
when
the
michigan
rules
of
evidence
were
in
existence
for
several
months.
until
then,
the
declaration
against
penal
interest
hearsay
exception
didn't
exist
in
michigan.
i
don't
believe
it
existed
in
the
federal
system
until
the
federal
rules
were
adopted.
but
i
would
point
out
that
this
court
has
held
in
dewey
v.
des
moines
that
a
litigant
is
not
restricted
to
the
arguments
raised
below
on
a
federal
question
so
long
as
the
argument
is
connected
with
the
issue
being
raised.
what
a
litigant
cannot
do
is
come
before
this
court
on
an
issue
and
raise
an
issue
unconnected
to
the
one
before
it.
if
this
court
finds
williams
was
a
witness
against
respondent,
it
simply
hasn't
found
constitutional
error
unless
it
finds
that
the
admission
of
the
confession
against
respondent
violates
confrontation
principles,
namely
that
it
was
unreliable.
thank
you.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
very
briefly,
your
honor,
two
quick
points.
the
first
is
to
the
rule.
where
the
system
is
based
on
truth
and
faith,
which
is
what
our
system
is
based
on
in
terms
of
the
jury
following
instructions,
i
would
submit
that
bright
line
rules
are
justifiable
and
preferable,
and
i
would
argue
for
a
rule,
as
i
think
my
brief
makes
clear,
that
there
be
no
such
doctrine
as
evidentiary
linkage
or
contextual
implication
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
"boffman",
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
to
the
prosecutor's
statement?
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
he
could
have
asked
for
a
further
cautionary
instruction
or
he
could
have
asked
for
a
mistrial
at
that
point.
i
think
those
would
have
been
his
options.
and
then
at
least
it
would
have
been...
the
issue
would
have
been
preserved
for
a
court
to
find
at
the
end--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--and
i
think
that--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that
is
correct,
i
believe.
however,
as
i
began
to
indicate
earlier,
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
a
prosecutor
violates
his
requirements
in
closing
argument
is
different
than
the
question
before
us
in
terms
of
confession
and
redaction.
you
can
argue
facts
not
in
evidence,
and
i
suppose
in
a
sense
that's
a
violation
of
confrontation
because
nobody
ever
even
testified
to
that.
we
don't
usually
analyze
it
in
that
context,
and
we
require
an
objection
to
preserve
it
and
that
it
be
raised
in
the
lower
courts.
and
i
really
think
it
should
be
viewed
as
a
separate
question
than
in
the
question
right
before
us,
whether
the
prosecutor
erred
in
his
argument
as
opposed
to
whether
or
not
severance
should
have
been
granted
in
this
case.
thank
you.
