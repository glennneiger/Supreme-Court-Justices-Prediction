mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
stevens,
if
i
could
first
address
the
question
of
the
prosecutor's
summation
that
you
raised
a
little
earlier.
the
sixth
circuit
was
plainly
troubled
by
what
it
thought
the
prosecutor
had
said.
my
suggestion
is
that
it
is
overreading
the
prosecutor's
summation
to
suggest,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
that
he
in
effect
tied
together
the
inadmissible,
and
the
concededly
inadmissible,
williams
statement
with
the
defendant's
testimony
in
her
direct
case.
it's
clear
on
its
face
that
he
at
no
time
referred
to
the
williams
statement
as
such
in
making
his
argument.
indeed,
he
gave
his
own
limiting
instruction
as
a
preface
to
the
jury,
telling
them
that
it
would
be
quite
unfair
to
make
that
connection.
i
think
this
court
has
stressed
in
cases
like
donnelly
against
dichristifaro
that
it
is
wrong
to
read
an
otherwise
ambiguous
remark
in
the
prosecutor's
summation
in
its
worst
possible
light.
but
i
don't
think
you
even
have
to
rely
on
that
ordinary
presumption
to
read
the
prosecutor's
summation
as
nothing
more
than
an
attack
on
ms.
marsh's
credibility
when
she
denied
having
heard
what
happened
in
the
car.
now,
that
was
testimony
that
she
freely
gave
and
would
not
otherwise
have
been
in
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
in
the
context
of
the
summation,
i
think
it's
important
to
be
clear
that
prior
to
this
particular
remark
by
the
prosecutor
in
summation
he
had
been
going
through
various
parts
of
her
testimony
and
the
other
evidence
at
trial
to
show
that
in
fact
she
did
know
about
a
plan
in
advance:
that
she
had
used,
for
example,
coded
language
that
matched
others,
language
that
various
of
the
other
confederates
had
used.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
don't...
i'm
afraid
i
beg
to
differ.
i
think
a
jury
could
fairly
conclude
that
what
ms.
marsh
did
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
not
only
the
language
that
she
used,
but
the
way
she
behaved,
is
as
entirely
consistent
with
having
worked
out
a
plan
in
advance
as
with
the
opposite,
and
given
the
inference,
that
inferences
ought
to
be
drawn
in
favor
of
the
verdict.
it
seems
to
me,
for
example,
that
her
having
grabbed
cynthia
knighton
and
her
child
when
they
tried
to
escape,
at
a
time
when
she
knew
that
the
confederates
had
drawn
guns,
had
forced
people
on
their
knees
or
face
down
on
the
floor,
at
that
point
for
her
to
have
prevented
these
two
people's
escape
strikes
me
as
entirely
consistent
with
having
been
in
on
a
plan
to
see
to
it
that
those
people
would
not
live
to
tell
the
tale.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
there
may
be,
justice
stevens,
a
number
of
available
inferences
from
any
piece
of
proof.
but
it
strikes
me
that,
given
the
presumptions
that
attend
a
jury
conviction,
a
verdict,
it
seems
to
me
this
was
sufficient
evidence
for
us
not
to
be
concerned
that
ambiguous
remarks
in
a
prosecutor's
summation
gave
rise
to
the
use
of
inadmissible
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
is
powerful
evidence
if
the
jury
disobeyed
its
instructions.
but
i
think
the
premise.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
what
he
had
been
doing
at
that
point
in
the
transcript...
and
i'm
referring
now
to
the
transcript
at
page
452,
the
summation.
i
think
what
he
had
been
doing
was
rather
methodically
going
through
her
testimony
and
the
other
evidence
in
the
case
to
suggest
that
she
indeed
knew
about
a
plan
in
advance.
then
he
turns
to
her
testimony
about
the
car
and
he
says,
i
think
fairly
read--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
he
drew
the
jury's
attention
to
the
fact
that
she
put
herself
in
the
car.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
true.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the
bottom
line
i
think
is
that
compared
in
particular
to
the
kinds
of
cases
in
which
courts
have
justifiably
chastised
prosecutors
for
making
that
impermissible
link...
and
i'd
suggest
as
a
good
comparison
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
u.s.
against
rodriguez
in
555
f.
2d
at
316
to
317
is
an
example
that
really
makes
this
case
pale
by
comparison.
i'd
like,
however,
to
turn
my
focus
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
idea
of
redaction
in
general.
this
court
when
it
decided
bruton
in
fact
indicated
that
one
alternative
way
of
placing
a
co-defendant's
confession
before
a
jury
in
a
joint
trial
was
through
redacting
references
to
the
defendant,
a
point
picked
up
by
the
american
bar
association
in
1968.
and
while
the
court
in
terms
has
never
said
precisely
what
kinds
of
redactions
will
satisfy
the
rule
in
bruton,
a
good
deal
of
what
the
court
has
said
ought
to
focus
trial
courts
and
courts
of
appeals'
attentions
on
the
appropriate
standard.
we
take
as
our
point
of
departure
the
remarks
and
the
holding
of
the
plurality
in
parker
against
raldolph:
number
one,
that
bruton
is
a
narrow
exception
to
the
premise
of
jury
competence,
that
juries
follow
instructions;--
and
second,
that
as
a
narrow
exception
bruton
ought
to
be
tied
closely
to
its
facts,
and
those
facts
are
important
for
the
purposes
of
what
is
a
sufficient
redaction,
because
the
facts
of
bruton
deal
with
a
co-defendant's
confession
that
named
bruton
by
name
and
made
it
as
clear
as
could
be
that
he
was
a
participant
in
the
crime.
it
seems
to
us
that
when
you
redact
a
confession
and
when
you
move
away
from
the
paradigm
that
bruton
was
expressly
dealing
with,
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world;
and
that
there's
increasingly
less
reason
to
fear--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
justice
marshall,
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i'm
sorry,
justice
marshall?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the
fact
that
the
jury
knows
that
they
are
both
charged
together
is
of
course
true.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
true
as
well.
but
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--it
is
a
factor,
of
course,
that
the
defendants
have
been
charged
together
and
sit
at
counsel
table
together.
but
that
fact
i
take
it
was
equally
true
in
parker
against
raldolph,
in
which
quite
a
number
of
confessing
defendants
were
sitting
at
the
same
table.
and
yet,
the
court
recognized
that
there
were
circumstances
that
were
capable
of
attenuating
the
powerfully
incriminating
nature
of
the
co-defendant's
confession.
and
i
suggest
that
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
in
which
redaction
can
serve
the
purposes
that
bruton
was
concerned
about.
at
the
first
level,
if
redaction
goes
so
far
as
to
eliminate
any
reference
to
the
existence
of
another
participant
in
the
crime,
we
believe
that
there
ought
to
be
a
per
se
rule
that
bruton
is
not
violated
by
the
admission
of
that
kind
of
redacted
statement,
and
that
rule
covers
this
case.
but
it
doesn't
cover
every
case
because,
as
this
court
recognized
in
bruton,
as
justice
white
observed
in
his
bruton
dissent,
and
as
the
court
observed
in
tennessee
against
street,
sometimes
you
can't
redact
quite
that
far.
and
in
a
great
number
of
cases,
the
redactions
consist
of
using
blanks
or
symbols
or
pronouns
to
take
the
place
of
the
name
of
the
complaining
defendant.
in
this
area,
it's
harder
to
craft
a
per
se
rule.
but
we
think
again
that
this
court's
decisions
point
the
way
to
resolving
this
larger
number
of
cases.
we
think
the
general
rule
should
look
like
this:
that
redactions
that
use
blanks,
symbols,
or
pronouns
or
their
equivalents
are
sufficient
under
bruton
unless
the
trial
court
is
persuaded
by
defense
counsel
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
that
it
is
virtually
obvious
that
the
name
missing
from
the
redacted
confession
belongs
to
the
complaining
defendant.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
the
answer
is
it
depends.
in
a
proper
case,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
look
beyond
the
confession
itself.
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
take
the
position
that
the
confession
alone
has
to
provide
all
the
clues.
indeed,
i
think
the
plurality
in
parker
against
raldolph
suggested
in
a
footnote
that
that
was
a
problem
in
that
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
don't
believe
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
and
i
think
this
case
presents
the
situation
in
which
we
have
every
reason
to
think
that
that's
not
true.
for
example,
suppose
instead
of
leaving
out
ms.
marsh's
name
entirely
or
even
her
existence
in
the
williams
confession,
they
had
used
an
a,
as
the
prosecutor
had
originally
planned
to
do.
the
only
evidence
that
linked
ms.
marsh
to
this
crime
apart
from
the
williams
confession,
which
was
inadmissible,
was
cynthia
knighton's
testimony.
she
said
nothing
about
the
car
ride,
because
of
course
she
was
not
a
party
to
it.
so
there
was
no
other
evidence
that
put
her
into
the
car,
and
i
suggest
that
the
jury
would
not
have
ineluctably
reached
the
conclusion
that
she
drove
over
with
the
other
two
people.
and
therefore,
i
think
it's
not
inconsistent
to
say
on
the
one
hand
that
it
may
not
be
perfectly
obvious
who
the
missing
person
is,
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
that
there's
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
complaining
defendant
is
guilty
as
charged.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you.
