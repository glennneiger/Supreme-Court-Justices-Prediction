mr.
r.
steven
whalen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
bruton
versus
united
states
applies
to
a
redacted
confession
that
becomes
powerfully
incriminating
when
it's
viewed
in
the
context
of
all
of
the
evidence,
even
if
it
may
not
be
so
incriminating
viewed
in
isolation.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
actually,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case
you'll
see
that
before
the
defendant
clarissa
marsh
ever
testified,
there
was
in
fact
testimony
from
the
prosecutor's
case
that
linked
ms.
marsh
to
being
present
in
the
car.
specifically
i'm
referring
to
cynthia
knighton's
testimony
that
kareem
martin
and
ms.
marsh
entered
the
house
together.
if
you
link
that
with
that
portion
of
williams'
confession
where
he
says,
williams
says
that
he
parked
the
car
and
then
kareem
went
up
to
the
house
and
went
inside,
i
think
that
does
provide
substantial--
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
--true,
that
ms.
marsh's
testimony
leaves
no
question.
it
is
an
ineluctable
inference.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
the
problem
that
i
see
is
that
in
giving
that
testimony
she
found
herself
in
a
situation
which
i
believe
you
alluded
to,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
parker,
which
is
where
an
inference
is
created
prior
to
her
testimony
here
linking
cynthia
knighton's
testimony
that
they
entered
the
house
together
to
williams'
statement.
she
is
unable
to
challenge
that.
she
is
unable
to
challenge
the
existence
of
this
alleged
statement
of
martin
through
cross-examination.
so
the
only
way
that
she
can
challenge
it,
if
at
all,
is
to
waive
her
fifth
amendment,
take
the
stand,
and
set
forth
herself
the
circumstances
of
what
went
on
in
the
car.
unfortunately,
even
under
those
circumstances
she
can't
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
question,
which
is
whether
martin
even
made
the
statement.
i
think
there's
some
question
about
whether
he
did.
certainly
she
could
have
attacked
that.
the
key
to
this
case,
i
believe,
is
elucidating
what
bruton
meant
by
the
phrase
"powerfully
incriminating".
it
said
that,
the
case
said
that
the
confrontation
clause
would
be
violated
when
a
co-defendant's
statement
was
powerfully
incriminating
as
to
the
non-confessor.
it's
our
position
that
bruton
necessarily
has
to
involve
looking
at
the
statement
in
context,
because
the
focus
of
bruton
was
not
whether
the
statement
named
the
defendant,
but
how
much
eight
it
added
to
the
prosecutor's
case.
i
believe
the
language
was
a
statement
is
powerfully
incriminating
when
it
adds
substantial,
perhaps
critical,
weight
to
the
prosecutor's
case
in
a
form
not
subject
to
cross-examination.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
well,
justice
scalia,
in
our
case,
for
example,
i
think
the
prosecutor
should
have
been
aware
of
the
great
potential
for--
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
--i
think
superficially
that
looks
like
a
workable
rule,
but
it
ignores
what
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
termed
the
true
incriminating
effect
of
the
evidence.
again,
bruton
speaks
to
how
the
jury
looks
at
the
evidence.
if
there's
a
substantial
risk
that
the
jury
is
going
to
misuse
the
evidence
despite
instructions,
there's
error.
it
may
be
very
easy
for
a
judge
or
a
lawyer
to
look
at
the
statement
in
isolation
and
say,
well,
it
doesn't
name
the
defendant,
there's
no
problem
here.
but
the
jury
necessarily
looks
at
it
in
context.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
because,
justice
scalia,
in
this
corner
the
end
result
is
that
the
defendant
is
denied
the
right
of
confrontation.
and
the
result
that
flows
from
that
is
that
we
have
a
very
serious
question
about
the
integrity
of
the
truth-finding
process
and
the
reliability
of
the
verdict.
now
you're
right,
it's
not
a
perfect
world.
and
i
think
that's
no
more
than
a
statement
that
i
believe
the
petitioner
would
agree
with,
that
redaction
doesn't
work
in
every
case.
in
any
trial,
things
can
happen
during
the
course
of
the
trial
which
can
make
an
ostensibly
neutral
statement
incriminating
in
context.
my
point
is
that
when
we
fashion
a
rule
to
deal
with
an
imperfect
world,
we
should
ask
ourselves
the
question,
who
should
bear
the
onus
if
during
the
course
of
the
trial
the
redaction
blows
up?
you
have
to
remember,
in
our
case
there
was
a
pretrial
motion
for
severance.
the
defendant
consistently
challenged...
even
after
redaction,
she
continued
her
objections
to
the
statement.
and
again,
referring
to
the
aba
standards
that
the
solicitor
general
spoke
of,
i
believe
that
the
correct
rule
would
be
that
once
a
defendant
makes
a
motion
for
severance,
challenges
the
co-defendant's
statement,
the
prosecutor
then
has
an
election.
there's
a
number
of
things
that
he
can
do.
he
can
agree
to
a
separate
trial,
and
in
this
case
i
submit
that
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
statement...
that
there
was
a
potential
for
spillover.
he
could
agree
to
a
separate
jury.
he
could
agree
to
a
joint
trial
where
the
statement
wasn't
used,
or
he
could
choose
the
option
of
redaction.
now,
where
he
chooses
redaction
and
where
the
situation
blows
up
because
of
events
that
occur
later
in
trial,
i
think
it
is
the
prosecutor
who
should
bear
the
risk.
he
is
certainly
the
beneficiary
of
the
joint
trial
rule,
and
i
think
that
it
is
he
that
should
bear
the
risk
if
things
blow
up,
particularly
if
as
a
result
we
have
powerfully
incriminating
evidence
to
add
substantial
weight
to
his
case
that
comes
in
untested
by
cross-examination.
there
are
a
number
of
factors
in
our
case
that
i
believe
combine
to
create
the
risk
that
bruton
spoke
of,
that
the
jury
would
misuse
the
evidence
in
spite
of
cautionary
instructions.
first
of
all,
the
cornerstone
of
the
prosecutor's
case
in
relation
to
the
murder
charge
was
that
there
was
a
preconceived
and
prediscussed
plan
to
not
only
rob
but
to
kill
the
victims,
and
that
this
discussion,
this
plan,
was
hatched
before
they
ever
got
over
to
the
house.
that
was
his
theory
as
to
both
defendants,
and
arguing
clarissa
marsh's
case
to
the
jury
i
counted
new
fewer
than
13
times
that
he
told
the
jury
that
clarissa
marsh
was
part
of
the
plan,
that
she
was
in
on
the
planning
stages
of
the
robbery
and
the
killing.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
if
she
were
in
on
the
robbery...
and
i
believe
that
there
is
probably
sufficient
evidence
of,
circumstantial
evidence
of
her
participation
in
the
robbery,
but--
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
--i
think
there's
circumstantial
evidence
of
planning
of
the
robbery.
but
the
question
is,
and
this
goes
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
about
the
degree
of
her
culpability,
when
you
get
to
the
question
of...
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
both
she
and
williams
were
tried
as
aiders
and
abettors,
so
under
michigan
law
it
was
necessary
for
the
prosecutor
to
show
that
she
had
knowledge
of
the
principal's
intent,
and
of
course
that
knowledge
is
strongly
shown
by
the...
would
be
shown
by
a
discussion
that,
yes,
we're
going
to
have
to
take
the
victims
out
after
we
get
there.
the
question
really
isn't
so
much
as
to
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
of
even
the
felony
murder.
the
question
is
how
much
weight
does
the...
does
williams'
confession
add.
now,
every
court
below
that's
spoken
to
this
issue
of'
the
sufficiency
has
termed
the
other
evidence
of
intent
and
knowledge
of
the
plan
to
murder
as
barely
sufficient.
they
call
it
marginal,
they've
called
it
a
close
question.
they've
talked
about
the
paucity
of
evidence
on
intent.
and
of
course
the
sixth
circuit
in
our
case
expressly
declined
to
rule
on
the
sufficiency
issue.
but
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
sufficiency.
the
issue
is,
in
light
of
what
i
consider
the
weak
circumstantial
evidence--
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
--the
jury--
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
--the
jury
would
be
permitted
to
draw
that
inference.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
theoretically
possible,
yes.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
again,
the
point
i
would
make
is
that--
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
--if
the
jury
believe
that
the
killings
were
a
foreseeable
consequence.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
yes.
the
problem
again
being
that
it's
a
close
question,
as
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
termed
it.
and
what
bruton
looks
to
is
when
you
add
the
co-defendant's
confession,
which
you
can't
test
by
cross-examination,
how
much
weight
does
that
add?
and
when
you
get
to
the
point
where
this
is
the
only
direct
evidence...
and
in
fact,
when
the
prosecutor
was
arguing
williams'
case
to
the
jury
he,
of
course
and
properly
so,
referred
to
williams'
statement
that
kareem
martin
discussed
the
plan
and
said,
yes,
this
is
direct
evidence
of
intent.
he
knew
that
before
he
ever
got
over
to
the
house.
so
you
can
imagine
a
situation
where
the
jury
in
their
discussions
begins
by
discussing
benjamin
williams'
case
and
they
say:
well,
look,
we
have
this...
he
heard
about
the
plan
to
kill
and
he
knew
about
it;
the
prosecutor
told
us,
this
is
direct
evidence.
he
spent
perhaps
the
better
part
of
a
morning
discussing
that,
discussing
the
statements.
then
when
they
go
over
to
discuss
clarissa
marsh's
case...
and
again,
she's
tried
on
the
same
theory,
that
she's
part
of
the
plan,
that
she
was
in
on
the
planning
stages...
i
think
it's
unavoidable
that
they're
going
to...
i
think
it's
unrealistic
to
think
that
they're
going
to
be
able
to
put
that
confession
out
of
their
minds.
and
really,
that's
the
whole
point
of
bruton,
that
there
are
circumstances
where
the
evidence
is
so
powerful,
adds
so
much
to
the
prosecutor's
case,
that
it's
just
not
realistic
to
think,
given
the
limitations
of
human
nature,
that
the
jury
would
be
able
to
follow
the
instructions.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
yes,
she
did,
your
honor,
before
trial.
so
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
the
way
the
prosecutor
used
the
argument,
not
only
to
spill
over
from
his
argument
against
williams
but,
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
stevens,
in
impugning
clarissa
marsh's
credibility,
necessarily
implying
that,
yes,
she
did
hear
the
confession,
she
did
hear
the
statement,
if
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
i
think
there's
a
substantial
risk
in
this
case
that
the
jury
did
use--
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
--but
i
thin
what
we
have
to
ask,
justice
stevens,
is
that
what
if
the
jury
didn't
draw
that
inference,
what
if
they
didn't
believe
that.
yes,
that
is
a
permissible
inference.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
that's
clear.
that's
true,
she
knew
cynthia
knighton.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
the
defendant,
through
the
motion
for
severance
and
through
the
motion
to
exclude
the
statement,
had
already
been
ruled
against
by
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge
had
already
ruled
that
williams'
statement
was
inadmissible.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
well,
justice
scalia,
whether
it
was
or
not,
of
course,
i
don't
think
is
critical
in
this
case.
but
accepting
your
hypothesis,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
result
of
the
prosecutor's
argument,
which
was
to
create
a
risk
which
resulted
in
a
denial
of
the
right
to
confrontation.
either
you
have
a
right
to
confrontation
or
you
don't.
when
the
prosecutor,
the
person
who
has
insisted
on
the
joint
trial
throughout,
has
insisted
on
using
this
evidence
throughout,
who
has
assumed
the
risk
that
things
could
blow
up,
then
gets
to
the
point
where
he
stands
up
and
points
out
the
linkage
himself
to
the
jury,
again,
i
believe
that
it's
he
who
created
the
situation,
it's
he
who
should
bear
the
onus.
i
think
it's
putting
too
great
of
a
burden
on
a
defendant
who
has
consistently
tried
to
prevent
the
very
situation
which
occurred.
in
our
case,
in
fact,
the
problem
from
the
very
beginning,
the
problem
that
the
prosecutor
created
in
insisting
on
the
joint
trial,
i
think
ineluctably
led
to
the
argument
that
he
made.
it
was
difficult
for
him,
if
he
was
going
to
challenge
clarissa
marsh's
testimony,
to
not
say
it,
to
not
say,
oh,
she's
not
telling
the
truth,
or
she
has
to
say
that
because
otherwise
you're
not
going
to
believe
that
she's
part
of
the
plan.
not
only
the
defendant,
but
perhaps
he
was
in
somewhat
of
a
trap,
of
his
own
making.
and
again,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
result.
the
result
was
that
the
risk
was
created.
that's
all
bruton
talks
about,
the
risk
that
the
jury
would
misuse
the
evidence.
the
rule
that
i
suggest
for
this
court
is
analogous
to
that
which
justice
blackmun
discussed
in
his
concurrence
in
parker
v.
randolph,
and
that
is
to
acknowledge
that
there
are
circumstances
where
redaction
doesn't
work
and
where
a
redacted
statement
can
become
powerfully
incriminating,
violating
bruton,
and
then
subjected
to
a
harmless
error
analysis.
one
can...
harrington
versus
california
comes
to
mind,
which
incidentally
did
involve
a
redacted
confession,
where
this
court
made
a
statement
that,
well,
even
though
the
defendant's
statement
was
taken
out,
the
circumstances
of
the
case
could
make
it
as
clear
as
pointing
and
shouting
that
the
defendant
was
included
in
the
statement.
i
think,
at
least
tacitly,
this
court
has
recognized
since
bruton
that
statements
can
become
incriminating
in
context.
and
as
long
as
we
subject
that
to
the
harmless
error
rule
of
harrington,
i
think
we
have
a
workable
rule.
i
think
we
have
a
rule
which
fairly
protects
the
right
of
confrontation
and
at
the
same
time
doesn't
put
a
particularly
unworkable
burden
on
the
prosecutor.
certainly
not
only
the
sixth
circuit,
but
the
seventh
circuit,
the
second
circuit,
the
d.c.
circuit,
have
over
the
last
ten
years
all
endorsed
rules
which
would
allow
for
looking
at
a
redacted
statement
in
context,
and
life
goes
on
in
chicago
and
new
york,
both
cities
which
have
their
fair
share
of
joint
trials.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
well,
life
goes
on,
but
unfortunately
life
goes
on
without
the
confrontation
clause
in
these
joint
trials.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
my
point,
justice
rehnquist,
was
that
the
rule
is
workable
in
at
least
four
circuits.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
oh,
there's
no
question
that
it's
workable,
in
the
sense
that
it's
easy
to
apply.
the
problem
is
it's
not
fair.
it
may
be
easy.
trial
by
affidavit
would
be
easy.
but
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
concerns
of
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
the
test
i'm
proposing
is
that--
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
--that's
what
i
would
call
it.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
the
test
i
would
propose
is
that
suggested
in
the
aba
standards
in
joinder
and
severance:
faced
with
a
pretrial
defense
motion
to
sever
or
to
exclude
the
confession,
the
prosecutor
then
has
the
election
of
proceeding
in
any
number
of
ways:
joint
trial,
separate
trial,
separate
juries,
redaction.
if
he
chooses
redaction,
i'm
simply
saying
that
it
is
the
prosecutor
who
proceeds
at
his
risk.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
well,
i
agree
that
what
we
should
do
is
go
ahead
and
let
the
jury
decide
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
let
them
do
so
in
circumstances
which
guarantee
the
trustworthiness
of
the
verdict.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
own
language
in
united
states
versus
mechanik
suggests
that
the
considerable
costs
of
retrials
and
appeals
are
a
cost
that
we
have
to
absorb
if
the
harm
done
to
the
defendant
goes
to
the
very
reliability
of
the
verdict.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
why
couldn't
the
prosecutor
in
our
case
have
been
held
to
the
burden
of
foreseeing
through
his
own
testimony,
through
cynthia
knighton's
testimony
and
through
the
statement,
that
there
was
a
great
risk?
yes,
there
are
some
issues
that,
especially
issues
that
we're
subjecting
to
a
harmless
error
analysis,
that
will
be
looked
at
by
an
appellate
court.
for
example,
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
issues
are
continually
before
the
courts
on
appeal.
but
as
long
as
we
have...
are
subjecting
the
harmless
error
rule...
on
the
one
hand,
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
have
wholesale
reversals
of
convictions.
i
think
the
problem
is
going
to
be
fairly
infrequent.
on
the
other
hand,
the
per
se
rule
that
the
petitioner
is
suggesting,
that
you
simply
look
at
the
basis
of
the
statement
in
isolation,
is
not
workable
because
it
doesn't
sufficiently
answer
the
concerns
of
bruton,
it
doesn't
sufficiently
answer
the
concerns
of
the
confrontation
clause.
yes,
let
the
jury
decide
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
let
them
do
it
fairly,
let
them
do
it
in
a
way
that
they
can
assess
the
reliability
of
the
evidence
before
them.
if
we're
going
to
send
people
to
prison
for
the
rest
of
their
lives,
we
have
an
obligation
to
make
sure
that
the
verdicts
are
reliable,
the
process
by
which
those
verdicts
are
reached
is
reliable.
and
in
our
case,
i
have
serious
questions
about
the
reliability
of
this
verdict.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
yes,
i
did.
mr.
r.
steven
whalen
the
michigan
courts
ruled
against
me
in
that
question,
although
they
noted
that
it
was
a
close
question.
as
well,
the
federal
district
court,
to
paraphrase
them,
said
it's
a
close
question,
but
legally
sufficient.
the
sixth
circuit
declined
to
address
that
issue.
again,
the
question
for
this
court
is
not
sufficiency;
it's
how
much
weight
in
context
did
that
statement
of
williams
add
in
terms
of
the
conviction
for
murder?
i
think
it
added
critical
weight,
as
much
as
evans'
confession
in
bruton,
as
much
as
a
confession
that
would
have
named
her.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
