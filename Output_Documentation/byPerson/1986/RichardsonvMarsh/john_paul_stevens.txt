justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
so
you
don't
overlook
it,
are
you
going
to
address
the
problem
about
the
prosecutor's
argument
which
purported
to
tie
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
baughman,
on
that
point,
it
really
is
pretty
obvious
she
was
involved
in
some
of
the
advanced
planning.
i
don't
think
there's
much
doubt
about
that
inference.
but
is
there
evidence
that
she
would
have
known
about
the
particular
statement
that
one
of
the
two
men
made
to
the
other
about,
we
have
to
take
the
lady
out,
or
i
forget
the
exact
language,
which
would
indicate
a
plan
in
advance
to
kill
her?
was
there
any
evidence,
other
than
perhaps
her
overhearing
it
from
the
back
seat,
that
she
would
have
known
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
the
question
that
troubles
me
about
it
is,
do
you
think
that
particular
fact
might
have
affected
the
degree
of
culpability
that
the
jury
would
assign
to
her?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
accept
her
testimony
at
face
value...
and
of
course,
it
may
or
may
not
have
been
true...
that
she
was
in
the
back
seat
and
there
was
a
radio
on,
i
suppose
it
is
credible
that
she
might
not
have
heard
that
particular
remark.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
person
who
made
the
remark
had
been
on
the
stand
and
cross-examined,
he
might
have
confirmed
that
the
radio
was
on
and
she
was
in
the
back
seat.
we
really
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point
is
that,
even
if
there
were
no
evidence
of
her
advance
knowledge
of
a
plan
to
kill,
as
opposed
to
just
advance
knowledge
of
a
plan
to
rob,
that
she
still
could
have
been
convicted
of
the
same
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't
see
how...
on
its
face,
it's
certainly
perfectly
credible.
she
said
she
was
in
the
back
seat,
the
radio
was
on,
she
couldn't
hear
them.
why
would
that
impeach
her
credibility,
other
than
relating
to
the
fact
that
she
might
have
been
trying
to
disassociate
herself
with
the
statement
in
the
confession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that
would
all
go
to
the
general
plan.
but
the
particular
fact
of
an
attempt
to
kill
the
woman
who
ran
the
numbers
game,
the
only
evidence
of
that
is
the
particular
remark
in
the
finding,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
certainly
consistent
with
that.
but
it
would
also
be
consistent
with
just
wanting
to
carry
out
the
robbery,
i
suppose.
you
don't
want
people
running
around
telling
the
neighbors
there's
a
robbery
going
on
in
the
house.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
have
to
agree,
i
think,
that
if
she
heard
that
remark
in
the
car
before
she
went
in,
then
it's
terribly
powerful
evidence
that
she
knew
in
advance
someone
was
going
to
get
killed.
i
mean,
it's
stronger
than
the
circumstantial
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
did
the
prosecutor
make
the
argument...
i'm
sorry,
in
our
dialogue
i
lost
the
force
of
your
argument.
why
was
the
prosecutor
going
on
about
the
fact
that
she
volunteered
that
she
was
in
the
back
seat
and
couldn't
hear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
he
calls
the
jury's
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
particular
statement
was
made
in
the
confession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
he
calls
the
jury's
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
particular
incident
took
place
while
she
was
in
the
car.
the
only
evidence
of
the
incident
which
goes
to
the
plan
is
in
the
confession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right
after
he
was
talking
about
the
evidence
concerning
the
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
i'm
taking
up
more
of
your
time
than
i
should.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
whalen,
do
you
agree
with
your
adversary
that
if
she
merely
were
in
on
the
planning
of
the
robbery
and
then
there
were
the
killings
by
her
co-defendants
in
the
course
of
the
robbery,
she
could
have
been
convicted
of
precisely
the
same
offense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
planning
of
the
robbery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
you've
gone
past...
maybe...
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
the
precise
question
i
asked.
is
it
not
true,
as
your
opponent
contends,
that
if
there
is
evidence
of
planning
a
robbery
in
which
two
people
are
killed,
that
that
will
support
the
felony
murder
conviction
that
she
received?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
maybe
the
weight
would
be
different.
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
so
she
could
have
been
convicted
of
precisely
the
same
crime
even
if
the
jury
did
not
think
she
overheard
the
conversation
in
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
more
precisely,
even
if
they
didn't
think
she
specifically
intended
that
anyone
would
die,
but
she
did
specifically
intend
that
the
robbery
would
go
forward
with
the
risk
of
death.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
whalen,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
thing
that
troubles
me
about
your
argument
in
the
case.
if
one
asks
himself,
why
did
they
feel
it
necessary
to
take
out
the
lady
who
ran
the
numbers
game,
one
explanation
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
your
client
is
the
one
who
knew
her
best.
she's
the
one
who
was
the
access
to
the
house
and
she's
the
one
who
most
might
readily
be
remembered
by
the
decedent
had
she
not
been
killed,
which
would
tend
to
be
again
circumstantial
evidence
that
maybe
it
was
for
that
very
reason
that
respondent
would
have
wanted
to
have
had
her
killed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
is
clear,
is
it
not,
that
your
client
was
the
only
one
who
knew
the
victim?
