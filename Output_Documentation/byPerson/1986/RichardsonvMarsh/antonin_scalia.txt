justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
needs
the
confession
to
establish
what
conversation
had
gone
on
in
the
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
make
this
argument
earlier?
did
you
make
that
argument
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
tried
to
get
this
in
as
admissible
against
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
obvious
from
what?
the
whole
trial
or
from
the
confession
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
say
that,
you're
stating
nothing
but
the
condition
for
conviction
anyway.
that
is,
you
couldn't
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
person
committed
the
crime
unless
you
said,
well,
after
hearing
all
the
evidence
it's
obvious
that
the
blank
in
this
confession
was
this
defendant.
so
every
time
you
get
a
conviction,
you're
condition
would
be
met.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trouble
with
that
is
you
can't
tell
at
the
outset
of
the
trial.
the
prosecutor
doesn't
knew
whether
to
put
it
in
or
not,
because
you
can't
tell
until
the
whole
trial
weighs
out
whether
or
not
it
will
be
overwhelmingly
effective,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
your
case
for
example.
i'm
just
saying
we're
talking
about
framing
here
a
rule
that
would
not
allow
the
prosecution
to
know
beforehand
whether
it
should
put
in
a
particular
confession
or
not,
because
it
won't
know
for
sure
whether
it
will
be
overwhelmingly
persuasive
to
the
jury
until
all
the
evidence
is
in.
now,
if
we
had
a
rule
that
says
if
it
names
the
defendant
it's
out,
if
it
doesn't
name
the
defendant
it's
in,
that's
something
you
can
predict
beforehand.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
perfect
world.
i
mean,
there
are
other
kinds
of
evidence
besides
confessions
which
is
improperly
admitted
and
in
some
instances
may
be
overwhelmingly
damaging,
although
not
as
regularly
so
as
a
confession
would
be.
and
what
do
we
say?
we
say,
well,
so
long
as
there
is
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
you
disregard
it,
you
let
it
go.
now,
why
couldn't
we
adopt
a
similar
principle
for
those
confessions
that
don't
name
the
defendant?
it
won't
be
perfect.
there'll
be
some
cases
where
it
may
well
persuade
the
jury.
but
we're
willing
to
accept
that
in
other
areas.
why
not
in
this
little
corner
of
the
bruton
area?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
whalen,
let's
assume
that
i
thought
that
a
redacted
confession
would
normally
be
okay,
but
i
felt
that
the
comment
of
the
prosecutor
in
his
summation
undid
what
the
redaction
had
achieved.
why...
accept
my
hypothesis,
that
normally
i
would
think
the
redaction
was
enough.
why
shouldn't
i
put
the
burden
on
the
defense
to
object
at
the
point
that
the
statement
is
made
by
the
prosecutor?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you
have
an
additional
factor
coming
in
that,
as
you
argue
before
us,
makes
the
connection
between
the
confession
and
your
client
much
clearer,
to
wit,
the
statement
by
the
prosecutor.
why
shouldn't
that
have
been
objected
to
as
supplementing
the
invalidity?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
second
circuit's
rule
is
workable.
you
mean
you
have
trials
and
you
have
conclusions
to
the
trials.
but
do
you
know
for
a
fact
that
the
rule
is
being
applied
with
any
consistency?
i
mean,
it's
a
very
difficult
call.
what
is
the
test
that
you're
proposing?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
we
have
come
to
call
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
right,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
not
a
test.
that's
what
you're
looking
at.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
baughman...
am
i
saying
your
name...
"boffman"?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
the
purpose
of
an
objection
by
the
defense
have
been?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
to
the
prosecutor's
statement.
what
could
have
been
done
at
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
a
further
cautionary
instruction
would
do
not
good.
i
mean,
after
all,
the
whole
point
is
that
this
statement
makes
cautionary
instructions
useless.
if
it
made
one
cautionary
instruction
useless,
why,
i
assume
it
would
have
made
a
second
one
useless.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
thing
it
could
have
achieved
is
you
get
a
mistrial
sooner
rather
than
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
richardson
versus
marsh
which
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
also
involves
a
bruton
issue.
specifically
the
question
is
whether
bruton
applies
when
the
non
testifying
codefendant's
confession
has
been
redacted
to
omit
with
all
reference
to
the
defendant.
but
the
defendant
is
nonetheless
linked
to
the
confession
by
evidence
properly
admitted
later
in
the
trial.
respondent
clarissa
marsh
was
tried
jointly
with
benjamin
williams
for
murder
and
robbery.
at
their
trial
williams
confession
was
admitted
over
respondent's
objection.
that
confession
had
been
redacted
to
omit
all
reference
to
respondent
indeed
to
omit
all
indication
that
anyone
other
than
williams
and
the
third
accomplice
named
martin
had
participated
in
the
crime.
in
his
confession,
williams
described
the
conversion
he
had
had
with
martin
as
they
drove
to
the
victims'
home,
during
which
martin
said
that
he
would
have
kill
the
victims
after
robbing
them.
the
jury
was
admonished
at
the
trial
not
to
use
williams'
confession
in
any
way
against
the
respondent.
williams
did
not
testify.
in
her
testimony
however,
respondent
admitted
being
in
the
car,
with
williams
and
martin
but
claimed
that
she
had
not
heard
their
conversation.
respondent
insisted
that
she
did
not
realize
that
the
victims
were
to
be
robbed
and
killed.
respondent
was
convicted
in
her
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
state
courts.
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
denied
by
the
federal
district
court,
but
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
a
new
trial
under
bruton.
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
not
violated
by
the
admission
of
a
non
testifying
codefendant's
confession
with
a
proper
limiting
instruction
when,
as
here,
the
confession
is
redacted
to
eliminate
all
reference
to
the
defendant's
existence.
there
are
two
important
distinctions
between
this
case
and
bruton
which
cause
it
to
fall
outside
of
the
narrow
exception
bruton
recognized,
to
the
almost
invariable
assumption
that
jurors
follow
their
instructions.
first
where
a
confession
is
not
incriminating
on
its
face
as
was
the
confession
in
bruton
but
becomes
incriminating
only
when
linked
with
evidence
introduced
later
at
the
trial,
it
is
easier
for
the
jurors
to
follow
their
instructions
to
disregard
it.
second
if
limited
to
facially
incriminating
confessions,
bruton
can
be
complied
with
through
the
simple
process
of
redaction.
when
extended
to
confessions
that
only
become
incriminating
by
reason
of
evidence
introduced
later
in
the
trial,
application
of
the
bruton
exception
becomes
inordinately
disruptive
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall.
