justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-1517,
colorado
against
spring.
ms.
phelan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
what
kind
of
waiver?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
confused
it
with
some
kind
of
a
waiver,
you
said.
and
i
just
didn't
catch
the
adjective
in
front
of
waiver.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
ms.
phelan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
argument
where
we
left
off,
ms.
phelan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
fifth
amendment
really
protects
you
from
yourself
in
a
way
in
saying
that
you
can't
be
required
to
compulsorily
incriminate
yourself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
phelan.
you
have
no
further
time.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
benezra.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
think,
though,
the
miranda
court
intended
when
it
talked
about
knowing
the
consequences,
mr.
benezra?
i've
always
thought
that
it
was
the
fact
that
what
you
said
could
be
used
against
you,
and
really
nothing
more.
but
i
think
the
colorado
supreme
court
took
a
considerably
broader
approach,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
it's
a
subtle
shift
or
a
dramatic
shift?
you
now
characterize
it
as
a
subtle
shift.
what
if,
in
so
many
words,
the
agent
had
said,
all
right,
now
let's
go
back
to
several
years
before,
go
back
to
this
canyon
in
colorado
and
talk
about
what
happened
there?
not
subtle
at
all.
and
he
answers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
benezra.
the
case
is
submitted.
