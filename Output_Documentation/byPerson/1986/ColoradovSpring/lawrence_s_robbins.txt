mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
my
remarks
by
addressing
the
questions
regarding
deception
that
were
posed
at
the
tail
end
of
my
co-counsel's
argument
a
few
moments
ago.
first,
a
factual
question
raised
by
justice
o'connor
about
what
it
is
exactly
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
said.
as
i
recollect
the
opinion,
your
honor,
what
they
said
was
that
there's
some
suggestion
that
the
police
may
have
told
respondent
that
their
questions
would
be
in
connection
with
a
particular
subject
matter.
the
colorado
supreme
court,
i
don't
think,
goes
further
than
to
say
that
that
might
be
reflected
in
the
record.
my
reading
of
the
record
suggests
that
there's
no...
not
even
a
whisper
of
that.
in
point
of
fact,
the
written
waiver
executed
by
respondent
on
march
the
30,
1979,
is
not
even
in
the
slightest
tied
in
to
a
particular
crime.
and
that
written
waiver,
which
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
the
rights,
the
understanding
of
the
rights,
and
the
decision
to
waive
the
rights,
which
respondent
signed,
and
which
this
court
in
north
carolina
v.
butler
said
is
strong
evidence
that
the
waiver
is
valid,
was
in
no
respect...
did
in
no
respect
incorporate
any
specific
crime.
there's
no
testimony
that
the
agents,
the
atf
agents,
in
proposing
the
waiver
to
the
respondent
told
him
that
it
would
be
in
connection
with
a
particular
crime.
with
all
respect
to
the
colorado
supreme
court,
i
suggest
that
that
is
simply
an
invention
that
is
in
no
respect
reflected
in
anybody's
testimony.
mr.
spring,
by
the
way,
did
not
testify
at
the
suppression
hearing,
so
that
point
couldn't
have
emerged
from
his
testimony
either.
there's
simply
nothing
to
suggest
that
kind
of
trickery.
more
fundamentally,
however...
and
this
addresses,
i
think,
the
questions
posed
by
justices
scalia
and
stevens...
it
does
not
seem
to
the
united
states
that
trickery
and
deception
within
the
meaning
of
miranda
could
possibly
comprehend
the
kind
of
deception
and
trickery
that
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
may
have
been
averting
to.
in
point
of
fact,
respondent
suggests
in
his
brief
that
the
agents
structured
their
questions
in
such
a
way
as
to
enshroud
their
real
agenda.
as
respondent
sees
it,
the
agents
tricked
him
into
believing
that
they
were
simply
investigating
a
firearms
case;
not
a
homicide
case;
and
so
deceived,
the
respondent
involuntarily
waived
his
rights.
well,
there's
no
disputing
that
under
miranda
a
waiver
cannot
be
the
product
of
trickery
or
deception.
there's
no
quarrel
about
that.
but
even
if
the
failure,
the
simple
failure,
to
disclose
the
topics
of
interrogation
were
part
of
a
calculated
effort
by
the
agents
to
deceive
the
respondent...
a
conclusion,
by
the
way,
which
the
trial
court
flatly
rejected,
and
which
neither
appellate
court
disturbed
in
the
slightest...
that
is
simply
not
the
kind
of
deception
that
miranda
is
talking
about.
as
this
court
held
last
term
in
moran
v.
burbine
the
kind
of
trickery
that
can
vitiate
a
waiver
is
conduct,
"that
deprives
a
defendant
of
knowledge
essential
to
his
ability
to
understand
the
nature
of
his
rights
and
the
consequences
of
abandoning
them.
"
i
suggest
that
questions
posed
of
a
suspect,
even
if
structured
in
such
a
way
as
to
camouflage
the
officers'
true
agenda,
cannot
fit
within
this
closely
cabined
rubric
of
deception
as
proscribed
by
miranda.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
in
a
sense,
it
refers
to
the
consequences.
but
i
think
as
moran
against
burbine
makes
plain,
justice
scalia,
consequence
is
a
bounded
concept.
it
doesn't
refer
to
every
consequence
that
may
emanate
from
the
choice
a
suspect
makes.
the
only
consequence...
the
only
consequence...
that
miranda
is
intended
to
inform
the
suspect
about
is
the
simple
and
single
consequence
that
anything
he
says
can
be
used
against
him.
the
respondent
knew
that
much,
and
more
than
that,
he's
not
entitled
to
know.
it
follows
from
this
court's
explanation
of
the
concept
of
deception
in
moran,
the
kind...
the
limited
concept
of
deception
that
miranda
forbids,
that
hiding
the
ball,
as
it
were,
in
this
fashion,
could
not
be
the
kind
of
deception
that
miranda
forbids.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
would
not.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that
may
be
a
different
question,
justice
stevens.
and
i'd
like--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
there
are
limits,
mandated
by
the
due
process
clause,
that
may
arguably
be
implicated
by
police
conduct.
miranda
is
a
different
set
of
rules.
it
is
intended
to
engraft
specific
prophylactic
rules.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i'm
sorry?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
might
in
a
proper
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
although
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
particular
case
is
foreclosed
by
certain
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
about
misstating
the
nature
of
the
evidence.
and
i
think
this
court
catalogued
some
of
those
cases
in
deciding
the
issue
of
trickery
in
moran
v.
burbine.
more
fundamentally,
it
seems
to
me,
the
complaint
that
respondent
suggests
about
trickery
in
this
case,
betrays
an
aversion
to
the
very
concept
of
interrogation
that
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
what
this
court
has
uniformly
said
about
the
necessity
of
conducting
lawful
interrogation.
simply
to
assert,
as
respondent
does,
that
the
agents
played
their
cards
close
to
the
vest
during
the
interrogation,
says
no
more
than
that
they
did
their
job
well.
police
interrogation
obviously
may
not
take
the
coercive
forms
forbidden
by
this
court
over
the
years.
but
neither,
i
suggest,
is
it
to
be
governed
by
the
rules
of
victorian
etiquette.
simply
to
describe
police
methods
as
deceptive
substitutes
metaphor
for
analysis.
indeed,
a
good
deal
of
what
constitutes
effective
and
lawful
police
work
is
effective
precisely
because
it
is
deceptive.
wire-tapping
is
deceptive.
using
informants
is
deceptive.
consensual
monitors
are
deceptive.
body
recorders
are
deceptive.
they
are
all
deceptive.
but
when
used
appropriately
and
lawfully,
there's
nothing
unconstitutional
about
them,
and
nothing
forbidden
by
miranda
about
them.
whereas
here,
the
police
did
nothing
that
can
be
said
to
have
obscured
the
meaning
of
the
miranda
warnings,
nor
in
any
sense
intimidated
respondent
into
waiving
them,
a
court
has
no
authority,
under
the
constitution
or
under
miranda,
to
refuse,
as
the
colorado
supreme
court
did,
to
enforce
that
waiver.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
