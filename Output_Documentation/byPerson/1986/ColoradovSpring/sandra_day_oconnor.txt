ms.
phelan,
may
i
ask
you,
if
the
respondent
had
told
police
that
he
was
willing
to
talk
to
them
about
the
firearms
offense--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
nothing
more--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--could
the
officers
have
then
asked
him
about
an
unrelated
offense,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
any
concern
that
that
was
implicitly
what
the
defendant
did
here,
or
at
least
his
understanding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
if
the
trial
court
were
to
find,
or
to
think,
that
implicitly
the
defendant
understood
and
intended
to
waive
his
rights
only
as
far
as
the
firearms
was
concerned?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
all
he
is
told
about
and
all
that,
as
far
as
the
circumstances
indicate,
he
would
think
about
was
the
firearms--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--offense,
would
not
raise
that
kind
of
a
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
colorado
supreme
court
suggested,
though,
that
the
agents
acted
deceptively.
i
think
they...
the
court
stated
that
the
agents
led
the
respondent
to
believe
that
he
would
be
questioned
about
one
crime,
but
then
interrogated
him
about
a
totally
unrelated
offense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
that
the
supreme
court
was
in
error--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
it
made
that
statement?
