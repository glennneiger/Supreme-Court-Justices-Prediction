i
wonder
about
that
last
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he's
less
than
average
intelligence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well...
what
was
it
he
said,
i
shot
some
guy
once?
was
that
what
he
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
pretty
brilliant
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
ms.
phelan,
is
that
really
a
fair
treatment
of
justice
scalia's
suggestion?
because
there
is
language
in
miranda,
and
i
think
you've
acknowledge
this,
that
if
there's
trickery
involved,
or
something
like
that,
that
then
that
would
make
waiver
invalid.
i
suppose
at
least
it'd
be
theoretically
possible
to
say
that
in
order
to
avoid
trickery
there
is
an
obligation
to
give
some
information
about
the
extent
of
the
proposed
interrogation.
and
i...
i
thought
you
suggested
earlier,
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
that
if
they
had
said
to
him,
we
want
to
question
you
about
the
firearms
charge,
said
nothing
else,
would
that
raise
a
question
about
what
they
did
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i...
all
right,
take
that
case.
supposing
they
said
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
instead,
they
left
the
words,
and
nothing
else,
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
would
like
to
question
you...
we
have
probable
cause
to
believe
you're
engaged
in
trafficking
in
illegal
firearms.
we
want
to
question
you
about
that
subject,
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
all
the
rest,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
added
the
words,
"and
nothing
else".
"the
only
thing
we
want
to
ask
you
about
is
the
firearms.
"
then
you
say
that
might
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
robbins,
does
that
mean
that
for
example
if
the
police
officers
falsely
told
him
they
had
a
lot
of
evidence
that
implicated
him,
and
it
was
just
totally
contrived,
that
wouldn't
affect
his
understanding
of
his
constitutional
rights,
but
that
would
not
be
the
kind
of
deception
that
would
be
implicated
by
miranda?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that
would
therefore
be
completely
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it's
this
question,
because
it's
outside
the
constitutional
right
waiver
category.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
example
wouldn't
fit
the
trickery,
so
forth,
language
in
miranda.
it
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
example
i
put
would
not
fit
the
trickery
language
in
miranda;
rather,
it
might
be
a
due
process
violation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
may
i
just
ask
you,
you've
accepted
justice
scalia's
suggestion
that
they
just
decided
on
the
scope
of
the
waiver.
but
i'm
not
sure
you
get
that
out
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
opinion.
don't
they
say
the
waiver
was
invalid?
at
least
i
know
that's
how
justice
erickson
read
the
majority
opinion.
he
said
the
waiver
was
invalid.
or
do
i
misread
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
okay.
