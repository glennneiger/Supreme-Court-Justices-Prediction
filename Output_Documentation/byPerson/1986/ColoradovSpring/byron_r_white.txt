well,
surely,
he's
supposed
to
know
that
he
can
remain
silent.

and
that
he
can
have
an

and
isn't...
isn't,
as
far
as
waiver
is
concerned,
isn't
there
a
new
waiver
everytime
a
question
is
asked
and
he
answers
it?
because
at
that
time
he
can
always
refuse
to
answer,
and
say,
i
prefer
to
remain
silent?
justice

and
if
it's
perfectly...
suppose
that
all
the
questions
that
were
asked
here
were
very
relevant
to
the
firearms
charge;
just
suppose
that.
the
only
thing
is
that
the
police
had
some
suspicion
about
the
fact
that
he
might
be
implicated
in
a
murder.
and
they
really
intended
to
ask
him
about
the...
i
mean,
they
were
driven
to
ask
these
questions
not
only
on
the
firearms
charge
but
on
the
murder.
i
don't
suppose
that
there'd
be
anything
wrong
with
that.
perfectly
valid
questions;
perfectly
relevant
to
the
firearms
charge.
justice

also
went
to
the
murder,
but
he
never
suspected
that
he
was
suspected
of
the
murder.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
suppose
that
the
questions,
however...
it
was
perfectly
clear,
when
they
asked
a
certain
question,
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
firearms
charge.
they
say,
well
now,
we
want
to
talk
about
this
murder.
and
they
ask
him
a
question
and
he
answers
it.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
valid
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
that
different
from
this?
they
got
to
the
question,
and
you
said
that
when
they
got
to
this...
these
two
questions,
it
was
perfectly
plain
they
were
leaving
the
firearms
charge.
why
wasn't
that
as
plain
to
him?
and
he
had
refused
to
answer
some
earlier
questions
too,
hadn't
he?
