mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
a
narrow
one.
the
issue
is
not
whether
police
officers,
prior
to
questioning,
must
inform
a
suspect
of
all
the
possible
subjects
of
interrogation.
rather
the
issue
is
whether
the
colorado
supreme
court,
given
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
mr.
spring
was
being
investigated
on
weapons
charges,
and
was
then
interrogated
on
a
completely
unrelated
homicide,
correctly
concluded
that
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
the
prosecution
had
not
met
its
burden
of
proving
a
valid
waiver.
the
petitioner
has
given
you
its
view
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
i
would
make
the
following
additions
and
corrections.
early
in
february
of
1979,
john
spring
was
involved
in
the
shooting
death
of
donald
walker
in
craig,
colorado.
in
mid-february
of
that
year,
spring
told
george
dennison,
of
kansas
city,
missouri,
about
the
shooting.
in
late
february,
dennison
contacted
harold
wactor,
an
agent
with
the
kansas
city
office
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms.
dennison
informed
wactor
that
spring
was
involved
in
a
plan
to
steal
firearms,
transport
them
interstate,
and
sell
them.
dennison
also
informed
wactor
of
spring's
involvement
in
the
walker
homicide.
on
march
23rd,
1979,
informant
dennison
set
up
a
telephone
conversation
with
spring
which
was
tape
recorded
by
atf
agents,
and
during
which,
spring
arguably
implicated
himself
in
the
murder.
on
march
30th,
spring
was
arrested
in
kansas
city,
missouri,
curing
an
actual
hand-to-hand
sale
of
stolen
firearms
to
federal
agents.
to
reiterate,
at
the
time
of
spring's
arrest
on
firearms
charges,
the
federal
agents
knew
of
the
colorado
homicide;
knew
of
spring's
involvement
in
the
crime;
and
were
in
possession
of
a
taped
phone
conversation
in
which
spring
arguably
implicated
himself
in
the
murder.
following
his
arrest,
spring
was
read
his
rights
by
federal
agents.
spring
waived
those
rights.
spring
was
not
advised
that
he
was
a
murder
suspect.
and
as
the
colorado
supreme
court
noted,
there
was
no
basis
to
conclude
that
spring
could
reasonably
have
expected
that
the
interrogation
would
extend
to
the
to
the
walker
murder.
spring
was
questioned
first
about
the
firearms
transaction.
he
was
then
asked
if
he
had
a
criminal
record;
if
he
had
shot
anyone
else;
if
he
had
been
to
colorado;
and
finally,
whether
he
had
shot
donnie
walker
west
of
denver.
as
the
colorado
supreme
court
noted,
nothing
about
the
interrogation,
leading
up
to
the
final
questions
regarding
walker
and
colorado,
would
have
suggested
to
spring
that
a
topic
of
inquiry
would
be
the
colorado
homicide.
the
colorado
supreme
court
applied
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
enunciated
by
this
court
in
north
carolina
v.
butler,
and
fare
v.
michael
c,
in
holding
that
spring
had
not
validly
waived
his
rights
with
regard
to
the
homicide.
in
reaching
its
conclusion,
the
court
noted
that
at
the
time
of
the
waiver
on
firearms
charges,
spring
was
totally
unaware,
and
had
no
reason
to
be
aware,
that
he
was
to
be
questioned
about
the
colorado
homicide.
the
court
emphasized
that
the
record
offered
little
with
regard
to
spring's
intelligence,
or
his
acquaintance
with
the
criminal
justice
system.
and
just
to
respond
to
some
of
the
comments
of
the
petitioner,
nothing
in
the
record
of
the
suppression
hearing...
nothing
in
the
transcript
of
the
suppression
hearing
indicates
anything
about
a
prior
criminal
record,
with
the
exception
of
a
juvenile
record
for
shooting
his
aunt.
so
that
information
was
not
before
the
trial
court,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
source
of
that
information
is.
the
court
took
into
account
the
particular
circumstances
surrounding
the
interrogation,
including
the
fact
that
the
federal
agents
had
information
about
a
much
more
serious
crime;
withheld
that
information
from
spring;
as
well
as
the
dramatic
shift
in
the
focus
of
the
interrogation
which
occurred
in
a
misleading
fashion.
it
thus
seems
clear
that
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
impact
of
the
interrogation
techniques
employed,
on
spring's
opportunity
to
exercise
his
rights
with
regard
to
the
homicide.
given
all
these
circumstances,
the
colorado
supreme
court
held
that
the
prosecution
had
not
met
its
burden
of
proving
a
valid
waiver
with
regard
to
the
homicide.
in
miranda
v.
arizona,
this
court
held
that
to
protect
the
individual's
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
concrete
constitutional
guidelines
must
be
established
for
police
officers
and
for
courts
to
follow.
the
court
thus
held
that
prior
to
custodial
interrogation,
a
suspect
must
be
advised
of
the
now-familiar
miranda
warnings.
like
the
warnings,
a
suspect's
waiver
of
his
rights
is
indispensable
to
the
admissibility
of
his
statements.
this
court
has
held
that
a
waiver
must
be
knowing,
intelligent
and
voluntary,
and
must
be
made
with
an
understanding
of
the
consequences
of
waiver.
in
deciding
whether--
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
--this
court,
in
miranda,
indicated
that
the
consequence
of
waiving
the
rights
was
that
the
statement
would
be
used
against
you.
this
court
did
not
indicate,
however,
that
that
was
the
only
consequence
a
defendant
needs
to
be
aware
of.
the
colorado
supreme
court's
analysis
does
not
seem
to
turn
on
an
evaluation
of
the
consequences
really
facing
the
defendant
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
it
also
went
to...
also
went
to
the
murder,
is
that
the
question?
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
problem
in
colorado.
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
that
may
very
well
be
a
valid
waiver
under
the
rule
in
colorado.
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
on
this
particular...
on
this
particular
day?
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
i
don't
believe
the
record
indicates
that.
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
yes,
on
another
day.
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
that's
correct.
i
think
the...
what
the
colorado
supreme
court
was
considering
in
this
case
was
that
there
was
a
subtle
shift
from
these
questions
that
bore
no
direct
relation
to
the
colorado
homicide
to
the
questions
that
did.
and
i
think
the
court
heavily
weighed
the
fact
that
the
record
was
silent
with
regard
to
his
intelligence--
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
--i
think
that
would
present
a
very
different
case.
i
think
in
that
case
the
court
may
very
well
find
that
he's
on
sufficient
notice
at
that
point.
the
court
was
concerned
here
with
the
shift.
the
court
was
also
concerned
that
there
was
very
little
in
the
record
about
the
defendant's
background
and
his
experience
with
the
criminal
justice
system.
and
i
think
what's
implicit
in
this
decision
is
the
view
that
he
may
not
have
realized
at
that
point
that
the
subject
matter
was
shifting;
and
he
may
not
have
therefore
had
the
opportunity
to
exercise
his
constitutional
rights.
and
i
think
that's
what's
implicit
from
the
discussion
of
all
the
circumstances
that
the
court
goes
through
in
the
case.
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
i
think
it
is
that
the
scope
of
his
waiver
did
not
extend
to
these
questions;
that
he...
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
waived
his
rights
with
regard
to
the
homicide.
and
that
is
the
language
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
used.
in
the
instant
case,
the
colorado
supreme
court
held
that
one
factor
to
be
assessed
under
the
totality
approach
is
the
extent
to
which
a
suspect
is
aware,
or
reasonably
should
be
aware,
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
interrogation
prior
to
its
commencement.
the
court
specifically
rejected
the
per
se
rule,
which
had
been
adopted
by
the
colorado
intermediate
court
for
rendering
invalid
any
waiver
where
a
defendant
is
not
specifically
advised
by
the
police
of
the
nature
of
the
offense
prior
to
questioning.
the
court
held
that
in
all
such
cases
the
proper
standard
for
determining
the
validity
of
a
waiver
is
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
colorado
supreme
court's
decision
is
correct.
under
certain--
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
--yes,
it
goes
to
the
scope
of
the
waiver.
the
colorado
supreme
court's
decision--
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
--the
court,
in
its
opinion,
indicated
that
he
had
not
made
a
knowing
and
intelligent
and
voluntary
waiver
with
regard
to
the
homicide.
mr.
seth
jeremy
benezra
the
colorado
supreme
court's
decision
is
also
supported
by
this
court's
decision
in
fare
v.
michael
c.
in
fare,
this
court,
in
upholding
the
validity
of
the
respondent's
miranda
waiver,
noted
that
the
respondent
was
aware
that
he
was
to
be
questioned
about
a
murder.
fare
suggests
that
a
suspect's
awareness
of
the
nature
of
the
offense
is
a
relevant
factor
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
petitioner
asserts
that
the
ruling
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
would,
in
practice,
require
the
police
to
take
on
the
role
of
counsel.
according
to
petitioner,
police
officers
would
have
to
inform
the
suspect
of
possible
charges,
the
evidence
they
have,
the
legal
elements
of
the
offense,
possible
defenses,
likely
penalties.
simply
put,
nothing
about
the
colorado
supreme
court's
decision
goes
so
far.
spring
speaks
only
about
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
where
spring
was
led,
by
all
the
circumstances,
to
believe
he
would
be
questioned
only
about
firearms,
where
atf
agents
obtained
a
waiver
with
regard
to
that
offense,
but
where
spring
was
then
questioned
about
a
totally
unrelated
homicide.
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
while
a
number
of
jurisdictions
have
adopted
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
approach
employed
by
the
colorado
supreme
court
in
spring,
they
have
similarly
rejected
waiver
challenges
on
the
grounds
suggested
by
petitioner.
in
moran
v.
burbine,
this
court
described
miranda
as
an
attempt
to
reconcile
society's
interest
in
effective
law
enforcement
with
the
coercive
nature
of
the
interrogation
process
by
giving
the
defendant
the
power
to
exert
some
control
over
the
course
of
the
interrogation.
the
colorado
supreme
court's
decision
in
spring
recognized
that
on
the
particular
facts
here,
where
spring
was
unaware
that
he
was
a
homicide
suspect,
atf
agents
were
able
to
subtly
manipulate
the
custodial
process,
and
elicit
incriminating
information
before
mr.
spring
had
the
opportunity
to
make
a
knowing
and
intelligent
decision
to
exercise
his
rights.
the
colorado
court
assessed
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
determining
that
spring
had
not
validly
waived
his
rights
with
regard
to
the
homicide.
the
court
properly
considered
spring's
lack
of
awareness
of
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
its
assessment.
the
court
emphasized
that
the
record
offered
little
with
regard
to
spring's
intelligence
or
acquaintance
with
the
criminal
justice
system.
the
court
took
into
account
the
particular
interrogation
techniques
employed,
and
apparently,
their
impact
on
spring's
opportunity
to
exercise
his
rights
with
regard
to
the
homicide.
spring
reveals
a
careful
and
thorough
analysis
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
as
is
required
by
this
court's
decisions,
and
its
decision
should
therefore
be
affirmed.
if
this
court
has
no
further
questions--
