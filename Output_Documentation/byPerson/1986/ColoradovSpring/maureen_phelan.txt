ms.
maureen
phelan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
today
on
a
petition...
or
for
a
writ,
rather,
of
certiorari
to
the
colorado
supreme
court,
which
did
suppress
a
statement
made
by
the
defendant.
i
will
very
briefly
summarize
the
facts,
and
then
i'll
explain
why
the
court
below
misconstrued
this
court's
decision
in
miranda
v.
arizona.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
my
opening
brief
in
this
court
i
really
did
not
go
into
all
of
the
facts
that
supported
the
trial
court's
conclusion
that
this
waiver
was
knowing
and
voluntary.
so
this
is
really
my
opportunity
to
get
those
facts
out.
again,
the
case
involves
the
validity
of
this
miranda
waiver.
the
facts
are
that
the
defendant
here
agreed
to
sell
some
stolen
guns
to
federal
agents.
they
were
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
agents
working
undercover.
he
was
arrested
during
the
sale.
he
was
put
into
a
police
car,
and
he
was
given
his
miranda
warnings
at
this
time.
in
addition,
he
was
also
given
an
additional
warning
that
he
had
the
right
to
stop
questioning
at
any
time;
and
he
also
had
the
right
to
stop
questioning
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
counsel
at
any
time.
he
was
then
driven
down
to
the
local
atf
offices...
this
was
in
kansas
city...
and
he
was
again
given
the
warnings,
and
again,
given
the
additional
warnings.
at
that
time,
he
signed
a
written
waiver,
and
this
written
waiver
is
included
in
the
record.
it's
very
specific.
it
states
that
he
did
not
want
an
attorney
at
this
time;
that
he
was
willing
to
answer
questions;
that
he
understood
what
he
was
doing;
and
that
no
promises,
threats,
pressure
or
force
had
been
placed
upon
him.
some
of
the
additional
factors
showing
that
this
waiver
was
voluntary
is
the
fact
that
this
defendant
was
23
years
old,
and
at
the
time
of
this
transaction,
had
quite
a
lot
of
prior
involvement
with
the
criminal
justice
system.
he
had
murdered
his
aunt
when
he
was
10
years
old,
and
shot
another
aunt
at
the
same
time.
and
then
when
he
was
18
and
first
released
from
his
juvenile
detention,
he
was
convicted
in
iowa
of
a
robbery.
about
two
weeks
later,
he
was
convicted
also
in
iowa
of
a
forgery
case.
and
a
couple
of
years
later,
at
the
age
of
20,
convicted
again
in
iowa
of
robbery
without
aggravation.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
this
defendant
was
anything
less
than
average
intelligence.
there's
no
indication
of
any
sort
of
incompetence,
no
claim
of
any--
ms.
maureen
phelan
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
maureen
phelan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
phelan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
phelan
the
fact...
the
other
factors
would
also
show
there
was
no
long,
intensive
interrogation
in
this
case.
he
spoke
quite
readily
and
quite
freely
with
the
officers
when
he
did
agree
to
speak.
this
interrogation
did
occur
during
normal
business
hours.
it
was
at
3:00
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
he
was
asked
during
this
interrogation
about
the
gun
charges,
where
he
had
obtained
the
guns,
things
of
that
nature.
and
at
the
end
of
it,
he
was
asked
several
questions
concerning
a
homicide
in
colorado.
the
atf
agents
knew
about
this
homicide
because
the
informant
who
had
told
them
about
the
gun
transactions
had
also
told
them
that
this
defendant
had
admitted
to
them
that...
or
had
admitted
to
him,
the
informant,
that
he
had
murdered
someone
in
colorado.
based
on
all
of
these
factors,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
defendant
here
was
properly
advised;
that
he
was
aware
of
his
rights;
that
he
responded
freely,
voluntarily
and
intelligently;
and
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
element
of
duress
or
coercion
used
against
him.
the
colorado
supreme
court,
however,
agreed
with
the
defendant
that
his
waiver
could
not
have
been
knowing
and
intelligent.
what
the
colorado
supreme
court
did
was
apply
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
and
they
held
that
his
awareness
that
they
might
question
him...
or
rather,
actually,
his
lack
of
awareness
that
they
might
question
him
about
this
colorado
murder
was
one
factor
to
consider
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
however,
then
the
colorado
supreme
court
took
that
one
step
further
and
held
that
this
was
a
determinative
factor,
because
if
he
didn't
know
all
of
the
possible
subjects
of
interrogation,
then
he
couldn't
be
aware
of
the
consequences
of
his
waiver.
and
in
fact,
the
colorado
supreme
court
took
the
entire
analysis
another
step
further
and
held
that
this
factor,
his
lack
of
awareness
of
the
possible
subjects
of
interrogation,
is
such
an
important
factor
that
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
has
to
actually
be
applied
to
that
sole
factor.
and
so
it
must
be
determined
now,
in
colorado,
apparently
in
each
case,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
understands
all
of
the
possible
subjects
that
he
could
be
interrogated
upon
after
he
agrees
to
speak
with
the
police.
so
based
upon
this,
the
colorado
supreme
court
held
that
this
waiver
was
not
knowing,
intelligent
and
voluntary.
and
i
would
insert
at
this
time
that
the
defense
has
tried
to
raise
an
issue
here
of
voluntariness.
and
although
the
colorado
supreme
court's
opinion
is
written
in
that
classic
formula
of,
found
to
be...
or
not
proven
to
be
knowing,
intelligent
and
voluntary,
if
we
look
back
at
the
colorado
supreme
court's
opinion,
it's
written
completely
in
terms
of,
and
it
discusses
only,
the
knowing
and
intelligent
aspects
of
this
waiver.
so
it's
clear
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
confused
this
knowing
and
intelligent
aspects
with
a
wise
waiver.
they
have
found
that--
ms.
maureen
phelan
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
maureen
phelan
it's
a
wise
waiver,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
they
have
confused
this
issue
of
knowing
and
intelligent,
or
especially
intelligent,
i
suspect;
they
think
that
in
order
to
be
an
intelligent
waiver,
it
has
to
be
a
wise
waiver;
and
that
the
consequences
that
the
defendant
must
be
aware
of
go
far
beyond
the
consequence
that
his
statement
can
and
will
be
used
against
him.
it
has
to...
he
has
to
be
aware
of
far-reaching
circumstances
surrounding
his
circumstances.
miranda
simply
does
not
go
so
far
by
its
terms.
miranda
requires
that
the
defendant
makes
his
waiver
knowing
what
his
rights
are.
miranda
requires
that
he
makes
his
waiver
knowing
the
consequences
of
waiver.
and
miranda
specifically
states
what
those
consequences
are.
he
must
know
that
the
state
can,
and
will,
use
this
statement
against
him.
so
we
would
simply
submit
that
by
its
terms,
the
colorado
supreme
court
went
way
too
far.
miranda
has
described
traditional
police
methods.
but
miranda
did
not,
by
its
own
terms,
actually
condemn
those
methods,
as
the
defendant
has
tried
to
imply
in
his
brief.
what
miranda
did
was,
describe
certain
traditional
police
interrogation
methods,
and
then
impose
a
balancing
test
on
this;
and
has
given
to
criminal
suspects
something
of
a
shield
against
these
traditional
police
interrogation
methods.
ms.
maureen
phelan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
phelan
may
i
proceed,
your
honor?
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court;--
before
the
break,
i
was
discussing
the
miranda
rule,
and
the
balance
that
that
rule
was
trying
to
obtain.
of
course
the
two
competing
societal
concerns
have
been
discussed
many
times
now
since
miranda.
we
have
the
very
compelling
societal
interest
in
finding
and
punishing
criminals.
but
we
have,
on
the
opposite
end
of
that
scale,
the
possible
risk
that
police
will
go
too
far
in
their
efforts
and
compel
admissions
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
so
the
miranda
case
did
try,
despite
this--
ms.
maureen
phelan
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
phelan
yes.
ms.
maureen
phelan
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
partial
waiver.
ms.
maureen
phelan
no,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
phelan
then
i'm
sure
the
trial
court
would
find
only
a
partial
waiver,
and
suppress
any
statements
concerning
anything
else.
ms.
maureen
phelan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
phelan
no,
your
honor.
and
of
course,
he
would
always
be
free
to
ask
the
police,
if
he
had
any
concern,
if
had
a
guilty
conscience,
for
example,
and
was
wondering
what
they
might
know
about,
he
certainly
has
the
option
of
asking
them
what
they
would
like
to
discuss,
and
of
making
that
partial
waiver.
but
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record
at
all
that
he
intended
that--
ms.
maureen
phelan
--yes,
he
could,
your
honor.
plus,
the
consequence
which
is
spelled
out
to
him
in
the
warnings
is
that
anything
you
say
will
be
used
against
you.
so
that's
pretty
clear,
that
whatever
we
start
talking
about,
if
you
say
something
that
can
be
used
against
you,
we
will
use
it
against
you.
the
balance
which
was
struck
by
miranda
was
to
give
the
defendant
some
control,
as
you
pointed
out,
so
that
the
defendant
has
the
power
to
control
somewhat
the
time
of
interrogation;
the
subjects
of
interrogation;
whether
or
not
an
attorney
will
be
present
at
interrogation.
therefore,
the
court
held...
and
this
was
underscored
recently
in
moran
v.
burbine...
that
traditional
interrogation
may
continue,
but
only
if
the
defendant
does
understand
that
he
has
the
right
to
silence,
right
to
counsel,
and
that
anything
he
says
will
be
used
against
him.
the
colorado
supreme
court
rule
upsets
this
miranda
balance,
and
with
no
benefit.
the
rule
harms
legitimate
law
enforcement
for
the
obvious
reason
that
if
we
have
to
get
into
discussing
things
far
beyond
the
rights,
things
that
may
go
to
his
self-interest,
then
it
will
discourage
confessions.
there's
the
further
possibility
that
it
could
actually
danger...
endanger,
rather,
police
out
in
the
field,
because
what
they
may
know,
which
they
wish
to
discuss
with
him
further,
may
concern
something
like
a
continuing
investigation
out
in
the
field
concerning
undercover
agents.
and
in
fact
we
know
there
were
undercover
agents
involved
in
this
case.
on
the
other
end,
to
balance
it
off,
there
is
nothing
to
balance
it
off,
because
this
doesn't
protect
the
defendant's
fifth
amendment
rights
any
more.
it
only
protects
him
against
himself.
and
there's
no
provision
in
the
constitution
that
a
defendant
has
to
be
protected
from
himself;
only
from
the
police.
ms.
maureen
phelan
that's
protecting
you
from
the
police,
your
honor.
this
rule
adopted
by
the
colorado
supreme
court
would
completely
destroy
the
bright
line
rule
that
miranda
has
crafted.
one
of
the
obvious
virtues
of
miranda,
mentioned
by
this
court
over
and
over
again,
is
that
it
is
very
clear.
it's
very
easy
to
understand.
it's
very
easy
for
the
police
to
use.
they
know
how
to
use
it.
they've
all
got
little
cards
that
they
carry
around
in
a
pocket,
and
when
they
arrest
someone,
they
pull
out
the
little
card,
and
they
read
the
rights.
it's
very
clear.
the
rule
advocated,
or
found,
by
the
colorado
supreme
court
is
not
clear
at
all.
it
would
completely
destroy
this
bright
line
test.
it's
not
clear
at
all
how
specific
the
police
would
have
to
be
in
discussing
all
of
the
possible
subjects
of
interrogation;
it...
it
adds
in
a
question
of
police
judgment
that
miranda
was
never
designed
to
have.
because
the
police
will
have
to
use
judgment
in
any
interrogation
situation
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
opened
up
possible
new
subjects
of
interrogation.
they
would
have
to
use
their
judgment
to
decide
at
exactly
what
point
they
would
have
to
stop
and
readvise
him.
ms.
maureen
phelan
well,
that
is
a
more
difficult
question,
your
honor.
it--
ms.
maureen
phelan
--no,
your
honor.
there's...
there's
no
misleading
here.
there's
just
a
lack
of
information.
ms.
maureen
phelan
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
certainly
wasn't...
was
not
a
sham.
ms.
maureen
phelan
under
the
circumstances,
he
should
have.
ms.
maureen
phelan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
phelan
but
they
didn't
specifically
say,
we
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
about
the
firearms.
ms.
maureen
phelan
well,
your
honor,
i
would
suspect
that
he
should
have
known
that
it
was
anything--
ms.
maureen
phelan
--on
anything
that
they
might
know
about
it.
ms.
maureen
phelan
well,
for
example,
your
honor,
as
part
of
the
firearms
charges,
where
he
obtained
the
firearms
was
in
iowa
in
a
residential
burglary.
and
he
would
really
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
police
might
know
about
that.
but
should
they
specifically
say,
you
may
also
be
a
suspect
in
a
burglary?
it
would
seem
as
though,
if
they
give
him
the
rights,
he
knows
he
doesn't
have
to
speak
to
the
police,
then
that
is
the
actual
information
that
he
needs
to
know.
i
think
to
go
back
to
your
initial
question--
ms.
maureen
phelan
--well,
your
honor,
this
court
could,
of
course,
adopt
that
rule,
and
add
on
that
fifth
miranda
requirement.
but
there
would
be...
in
a
sense,
the
court
would
then
be
opening
up
the
floodgates.
because
the
theoretical
underpinnings
for
that
rule
would
have
to
be
that
the
consequences
that
he
would
have
to
be
aware
of
are
all
those
consequences
that
go
to
his
self-interest.
the
next
hypothetical
case
i
could
see
before
this
court
would
be
one
where
they
told
him
the
nature
of
the
charges
but
they
didn't
tell
him
all
the
elements.
the
next
one
after
that
would
be
one
where
they
didn't
explain
the
possible
severity
of
the
punishment.
ms.
maureen
phelan
do
you
mean
is
they
specifically,
quote,
we
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
firearms
charges
and
nothing
else,
end
quote.
ms.
maureen
phelan
okay.
then
i
think
that
that
may
go
to
his
essential
understanding
of
his
rights.
that
may
serve...
we
would
have
to
get
the
real
facts
in
a
case
to
see
that,
but
it
may
serve
to
undercut
his
understanding
that
anything
he
says
can
be
used
against
him.
ms.
maureen
phelan
if
they
just
said...?
ms.
maureen
phelan
and
of
course,
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
ms.
maureen
phelan
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
was
perfectly
valid.
ms.
maureen
phelan
"and
nothing
else".
well,
i
don't
want
to
really
take
the
position
and
say
that
that
would
be
valid
or
invalid,
because
it's
really
not
the
case
here.
i
think
that
that's
one
at
those
cases
that
will
really
depend
on
the
facts
as
they
end
up
showing
up
in
the
record.
but
it
could
serve
to
undercut--
ms.
maureen
phelan
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
phelan
well,
of
course,
it
wouldn't
be
a
vacuum.
we
want
to
question
you
about
the
firearms.
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
okay,
i'll
speak
to
you.
and
we
have
a
very
specific
waiver
in
this
case--
ms.
maureen
phelan
--yes,
your
honor.
but
we
also
have...
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
very
specific
waiver
saying,
i'm
willing
to
answer
questions.
it's
not
limited.
it's
not
a
limited
waiver.
ms.
maureen
phelan
no,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
phelan
he
was
arrested
during
this
firearm
sale.
he
was
given
the
rights.
there's
no
indication
in
the
record
that
anybody
mentioned
anything
about
charges.
from
the
circumstances,
he
would
certainly
assume
that
it
had
to
do
with
the
sale.
ms.
maureen
phelan
your
honor,
i
think
that
reflects
a
less
than
careful
reading
of
the
trial
court's
specific
findings
of
fact
here.
the
trial
court
found
no--
ms.
maureen
phelan
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
phelan
yes,
your
honor.
and
plus,
i
don't
think
that
that's
really
the
lynchpin
of
the
supreme
court's
decision.
i
really
think
that
they
were
intent
on
adding
on
this...
this
fifth
warning
requirement.
i
see
that
my
white
light
is
on.
so
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
save
my
further
time
for
rebuttal.
