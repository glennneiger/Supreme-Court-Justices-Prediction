what
about
a
more
narrow
proposition
that
when
the
state,
going
into
the
interrogation,
misleads
the
suspect
into
thinking
that
they
want
to
question
him
about
subject
a,
when
at
that
time,
when
they're
going
in,
they
intend
to
question
him
about
subject
b,
that's
no
good.
why
would
that
be
such
a
disaster?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
isn't
that
the
question
we
have
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
arrested
him
on
a
firearms
charge,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
know
he
was
arrested
on
a
firearms
charge?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
knew
that
that's
what
the
charge
was
that
he
was
arrested
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
they
say,
we
want
to
ask
you
some
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
he
thought
it
was
on,
what,
theology?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
firearms
charge,
i
would
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
have
guessed
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be
a
good
rule.
but
is,
at
least,
not
a
disastrous
confusion
that
we
would
be
creating
if
we
adopted
the
rule
that
if
you
arrest
somebody
on
charge
a,
knowing
at
the
time
that
you
intend
to
question
him
not
about
charge
a
but
about
charge
b,
the
waiver
is
ineffectual.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
it
go
to
his...
why
does
what
justice
stevens
has
been
asking
you
go
ta
whether
he
understood
his
rights?
doesn't
it
go
to
what
the
scope
of
his
waiver
was?
we
just
had
a
scope
of
waiver
case...
case
before
this.
and
isn't
this...
doesn't
that
question
go
to
the
scope
of
the
waiver?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
somebody
says,
we
want
to
question
you
about
the
firearms,
and
he
says,
okay.
what
is
he
saying
okay
to?
he's
saying
okay
to
questioning
about
the
firearms.
justice
antonin
scalia
about
the
firearms,
i
mean
if
that's
the
question,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
the
issue
is,
whether,
when
he
said
that,
he
meant
only,
and
could
reasonably
have
meant,
only
questions
about
the
firearms
offense.
but
there's
no
indication
in
this
record
that
that's
how
the
question
was
put
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
arrested
on
the
firearms
charge,
and
simply
asked,
will
you
be
willing
to
talk
to
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
affect
the
consequence
of
abandoning
his
rights?
he
thinks
the
consequence
is
that
he
may
give
some
information
about
the
firearms
offense,
and
it
turns
out
he's
giving
information
about
a
murder?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
thought
that
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
that
day,
but
on
another
day?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
knew
he
could--
--he
knew
he
didn't
have
to
answer.
he
had
previously
declined
to
respond
to
some
questions
that
they
asked.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
benezra,
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
what
the
argument
here
is.
is
your
argument
one
or
the
other
of
these,
or
both
of
these:
that
he
didn't
understand
the
scope
of
his
waiver,
he
had
been
deceived
so
he
didn't
have
the
knowledge
that
was
necessary;
or
is
it
rather
that
the
scope
of
his
waiver
did
not
extend
to
these
questions?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
scope.
it
means
the
scope
of
the
waiver,
right?
