mr.
donald
s.
cooper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
case
concern
the
use
of
ice
areas
which
lie
off
the
coast
of
alaska
by
alaskan
natives.
obviously,
in
most
areas
of
the
world,
you
know,
water
is
water
and
land
is
land.
because
of
the
arctic
conditions
alaskan
natives
have
traditionally
ranged
far
out
in
the
ice
areas
off
the
coast
to
do
their
hunting
and
fishing.
they
have
set
up
camps
on
the
ice.
they
have
built
roads
on
the
ice
and
engaged
in
those
kinds
of
activities.
because
we
have
these
unusual
or
somewhat
unusual
circumstances
it
sort
of
gives
rise
to
what
you
have
identified
at
least
preliminarily
here
as
a
basic
issue
in
the
case,
and
that
is
whether
various
statutes
which
can
affect
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
of
alaskan
natives
in
fact
apply
to
these
ice
areas
lying
off
the
coast
of
alaska.
the
first
statute
is
the
alaska
native
claims
settlement
act,
and
that
statute
was
passed
in
1971.
it
was
passed
for
the
purpose
of
extinguishing
native
claims
to
the
interior
regions
of
alaska.
after
oil
was
discovered
in
alaska
the
oil
industry
needed
to
extinguish
native
claims
so
that
they
could
build
a
pipeline
through
basically
the
interior
areas
of
alaska
and
then
into
the
water
ice-free
ports
so
that
they
could
then
transport
the
oil
to
the
lower
48.
the
focus
of
the
claims
settlement
act,
it
was
always
considered
to
be
a
land
claims
settlement.
the
outer
continental
shelf
is
not
mentioned
in
that
statute,
and
really,
given
the
history
and
the
context
it
is
unsurprising
that
that
wasn't
didn't
come
up,
since
the
issue
really
was,
they
needed
to
extinguish
the
claims
in
the
interior
so
that
they
could
build
the
pipeline
into
the
port
of
valdez.
as
a
consequence,
as
you
look
at
the
claims
settlement
act,
it
does
not
seem
to
affect
the
outer
continental
shelf.
the
statute
uses
the
terms
16
osc
3102,
and
that
defines
public
lands
as
all
federal
lands
and
interests
therein
located
in
alaska.
just
from
the
plain
language
it
would
not
seem
that
the
claims
settlement
act
was
intended
to
apply
to
areas
lying
outside
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
state.
it
simply
says
in
alaska.
that
plain
language
is
also
outtressed
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
claims
settlement
act,
and
the
legislative
history
indicates
constant
references
both
in
committee
reports
and
by
testimony
that
says
that
this
claims
act
is
supposed
to
apply
to
the
lands
comprising
the
state
of
alaska.
there
are
some
references
that
say
specifically
that
this
act
applies
to
375
million
acres
of
land
in
alaska,
and
375
million
acres
are
the
interior
land
areas,
the
offshore
areas,
and
the
submerged
lands
in
alaska.
it
does
not
include
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
well,
i
think
you
do
have
it
before
you
in
this
sense.
this
case
is
here
on
an
appeal
not
from
a
final
judgment
but
from
the
grant
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
if
this
court
were
to
construe
the
conservation
act
and
the
claims
settlement
act
and
find
that
the
plain
language
suggested
that
neither
applied
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
then
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals,
obviously
the
court
of
appeals,
following
the
remand,
would
be
free
to
reconsider
its
decision
concerning
the
extinguishment
of
aboriginal
title.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
well,
alternatively,
what
we
would
suggest
is
that
it
that...
what
i
would
say
is
that
all
the
arguments
concerning
the
geographic
scope
of
the
claims
settlement
act
have
already
been
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case.
the
oil
companies
and
the
government
have
argued
that
they
have
relied
heavily
on
the
claims
settlement
act
as
suggesting
that
their
position
that
the
acts
are
totally
different,
and
we
have
relied
on
it
heavily
to
show
that
the
acts
have
to
be
construed
consistently,
and
i
am
not...
if
you
did
grant
the
cross-petition
and
entertain
arguments
i
don't
think
that
those
arguments
would
differ
from
what
you
already
have
before
you.
and
given
that
the
case
is
here
on
a
request
for
certiorari
from
a
grant
of
preliminary
injunction,
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
free
to
go
back
and
to
reconsider
its
decision
with
respect
to
the
geographic
application
of
the
claims
settlement
act.
when
we
get
to
the
conservation
act,
i
mean,
the
conservation
act
was
passed
about
ten
years
after
the
claims
settlement
act,
and
it
has
a
somewhat
different
purpose.
it
is...
what
happened
was,
of
course,
that
as
part
of
the
agreement
which
produced
the
claims
settlement
act
congress
chose
not
to
place
statutory
protections
for
subsistence
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
the
claims
settlement
act,
but
it
did
tell
alaska
natives
that
it
would
protect
those
uses
by
directing
interior
to
take
all
measures
necessary
to
protect
them.
and
in
fact,
in
the
final
committee
report
which
dropped
out
the
subsistence
protections
there
was
an
explicit
direction
both
to
the
secretary
and
to
the
state
of
alaska
that
they
should
act
to
protect
these
uses.
the
protections
for
subsistence
hunting
and
fishing
did
materialize.
when
congress
came
back
in
1980
and
passed
the
conservation
act
it
first
included
a
small
section
which
would
nave
protected
the
subsistence
hunting
and
fishing
rights
on
the
conservation
units,
the
(d)(2)
lands
which
were
created
by
the
bill.
alaska
natives
came
back
and
said
that
is
not
sufficient.
i
mean,
what
has
happened
is,
you
have
extinguished
aboriginal
title
to
land
and
interests
in
alaska,
and
we
basically
want
these
statutory
protections
to
be
congruent
with
those,
with
that
extinguishment.
and
the
alaska
natives'
proposal
went
directly
to
the
claims
settlement
act.
the
conservation
act
in
their
proposed
definition
uses
the
term
"public
lands",
and
it
defines
public
lands
as
federal
lands,
waters,
and
interests
therein
situated
in
alaska,
so
the
term
"public
lands"
in
the
claims
settlement
act
is
defined
as
federal
lands
and
interests
therein
located
in
alaska.
the
term
in
the
conservation
act
is
federal
lands,
waters,
and
interests
therein
situated
in
alaska,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
other
than
the
fact
that
in
the
conservation
act
you
add
the
term
"waters"
and
it
is
located
instead
of
situated,
i
mean,
those
terms
are
identical
in
the
two
statutes.
interior
basically
urges
this
court
to
accept
its
position,
which
is,
those
two
phrases
should
be
construed
totally
inconsistently.
when
they
get
to
the
claims
settlement
act,
they
suggest
that
it
is
ambiguous,
that
the
term
"in
alaska",
that
if
you
say
"in
alaska,
including
submerged
lands.
"
which
of
course
would
have
referred
to
the
oil
port
facilities
which
are,
which
the
pipeline
runs
through
submerged
lands
of
the
port
of
valdiz,
that
you
should
construe
that
broadly.
you
should
construe
the
term
"in
alaska"
as
extending
out
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
and
then
when
they
get
to
the
conservation
act
they
want
this
court
to
take
the
totally
opposite
viewpoint.
they
want
to
have
that
construed
as
narrowly
as
possible.
they
say
that
the
term
"in
alaska"
is
clear
and
unambiguous,
and
that
it
doesn't
include
the
outer
continental
shelf.
our
position
in
this
case
has
been
that
you
actually
can't
do
that,
that
obviously
the
two
statutes
are
historically
intertwined,
that
they
are
very
linked,
anti
that
whatever
construction
that
you
want
to
give
to
one
you
really
have
to
give
to
the
other,
and
there
really
isn't
any
room
given
the
close
fit
between
the
statutes
to
engage
in
this
inconsistent
interpretation.
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
legislative
history
also
supports
that.
once
again,
it
just...
section
810
of
the
conservation
act
comes
virtually
word
for
word
from
a
draft
of
the
claims
settlement
act.
it
was
one
of
the
provisions
that
was
removed
from
the
claims
settlement
act
in
1970
and
it
appears
again
almost
virtually
word
for
word
in
the
conservation
act.
and
again,
to
reemphasize,
that
the
definition
of
public
lands
in
the
two
statutes
are
virtually
identical,
again,
with
the
conservation
act,
if
anything,
having
a
slightly
broader
application
because
it
includes
waters.
just
for
a
second,
i
would
like
to
talk
about
what
the
policy
ramifications
of
a
consistent
construction
between
the
statutes
would
be.
in
the
briefs
and
so
forth
i
think
interior
has
suggested
that
applying
both
statutes
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
would
result
in
section
810
applying
to
ocs
leasing
and
that
somehow
that
would
be
a
horrible
result
which
would
somehow
compromise
the
nation's
interest
in
developing
its
oil
resources,
and
it's
a
somewhat
odd
argument
in
that
the
vast
majority
of
oil
which
has
come
from
alaska
has
come
from
onshore
oil
development.
i
don't
know
precisely
what
the
figures
are,
but
my
guess
would
be
80
or
90
percent
of
the
oil
produced
which
has
come
from
alaska
has
been
from
onshore
development.
and
so
it
wouldn't
seem
that
it
would
be
such
a
terrible
compromise
or
somehow
endanger
the
national
interest
to
apply
the
protections
of
the
conservation
act
which
obviously
congress
intended
to
apply
to
onshore
development
and
which
everyone
in
this
case
concedes
apply
to
onshore
development
to
development
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
certainly
ocs
leasing
is
more
risky
in
the
sense
that
is
poses
more
dangers,
and
to
this
point
in
time
it
has
also
not
produced
nearly
as
much
oil
as
the
onshore
development.
alternatively,
it
neither
statute
applies,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
or
there
wouldn't
seem
to
be
a
tremendous
compromise
of
the
national
interest
in
oil
development
in
that
case
either.
obviously,
if
the
claims
settlement
act
does
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
our
position
is
that
we
have
aboriginal
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
that
area
and
that
we
have
aboriginal
title
to
those
lands.
now,
those
claims
would
in
all
probability
preclude
oil
and
gas
leasing.
obviously,
the
conservation
act
in
section
810
doesn't
preclude
oil
and
gas
leasing.
it
merely
requires
that
that
leasing
be
somewhat
affected
by
the
specific
provisions
of
section
810.
recognizing
aboriginal
title
would
in
fact
preclude
oil
leasing
but
the
preclusion
would
occur
in
a
much
smaller
geographic
area.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
no,
your
honor,
it
held...
the
application
of
the
claims
settlement
act?
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
well,
your
honor,
the
complaint
in
this
case
also
raised
that
precise
issue.
the
complaint,
our
first
cause
of
action
in
this
case
was
aboriginal
title,
and
our
second
cause
of
action
said
if
we
don't
have
aboriginal
title
because
of
your
position
that
has
been
extinguished
by
the
claims
settlement
act,
then
we
want
the
protections
of
the
conservation
act.
what
you
are
talking
about
is
the
inuplat
community
case.
that
case
was
filed
approximately
two
years
before
our
case,
but
when
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
cases
were
consolidated,
and
in
the
opinion
on
the
inuplat
community
case
with
respect
to
the
discussion
of
whether
the
claims
settlement
act
applies
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
simply
references
the
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
what
it
did
is
that
it
assumed
that
our
claim
for
aboriginal
title
was
valid
unless
it
had
been
extinguished
by
the
claims
settlement
act.
it
then
held
that
the
claims
settlement
act
extinguished...
basically
the
claims
settlement
act
applied
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
had
extinguished
our
aboriginal
title
in
that
area.
then
it
proceeded
to
find
that
the
conservation
act
essentially
was
congruent
and
also
applied.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
yes,
we
did
file
a
cross-petition.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
yes,
it
is
still
before
this
court.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
well,
i
think
i
have
answered
justice
scalla's
question
the
same
way,
is
that
this
case
is
here
from
a
grant
of
a
preliminary
injunction,
and
of
course
on
the
remand,
depending
what
this
court
said
in
its
opinion,
the
ninth
circuit
could
go
back
and
reconsider
its
decision
with
respect
to
the
aboriginal
title
claims,
as
long
as
we
would
raise
it.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
well,
in
a
sense
that
would
be
true,
but
only
because--
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
--yes,
you
could,
but
again,
only
because
we're
here
on
a
preliminary
injunction
rather
than
from
a
final
order.
you
know,
alternatively,
although
this
court
has
not
done
it
routinely,
it
has
occasionally,
of
course,
issued
writs
of
certiorari
just
on
the
basis
of
the
petition,
so
obviously
it
has
the
power
to
pass
on
that
issue
if
it
would
so
choose
to.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
absolutely.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
absolutely,
your
honor.
our
argument
about
the
two
statutes
has
been
consistent
from
the
day
that
we
filed
the
case.
we
have
actually
never
argued
that
the
term
"in
alaska"--
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
no,
your
honor,
that
is
the
government's
position.
our
position
is
that
the
term
"in
alaska"
in
both
statutes
means
exactly
the
same
geographic
area,
and
that
either
both
statutes
apply
or
neither
statute
applies.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
we
are
arguing
for...
what
our
position
is
is
that
what
we
have
said
consistently
is
that
we
are
indifferent
as
to
whether
the
statutes
are
construed
narrowly
or
broadly.
we
are
arguing
for
a
consistent
interpretation.
if
the
government
wants
to
argue
for
a
broad
application
of
the
term
"in
alaska",
we
are
happy
with
that.
if
they
want
to
argue
for
a
narrow
interpretation
of
the
term
"in
alaska",
we
are
happy
with
that.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
yes,
it
did.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
exactly.
and
it
construed
the
two
statutes
together,
and
that
was
our
argument.
we
have
never
in
this
case
actively
argued
for
one
interpretation
or
the
other.
we
have
essentially
said,
you
can
construe
these
two
statutes
broadly.
you
can
construe
them
narrowly.
we
don't
care.
what
our
position
is,
though,
that
they
have
to
be
construed
consistently.
and
that
was
our
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
is
what
they
had
before
it.
you
know,
our
position
was,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
stretched
in
the
claims
settlement
act
to
find
that
the
term
"in
alaska"
included
the
outer
continental
shelf.
we
have
been
really
hesitant
to
attack
that
opinion.
one
of
the
questions
that
the
court
had
when
we
argued
the
gamble
i
case
is,
they
put
the
question
to
me
and
said,
well,
if
neither
statute
applies,
if
the
claims
settlement
act
doesn't
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
and
let's
assume
that
you
have
aboriginal
title
in
that
area,
and
now
it
is
also
true
that
the
conservation
act
applies
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
state
of
alaska
so
you
have
these
comprehensive
statutory
protections
which
include,
by
the
way,
an
absolute
priority
for
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
and
one
of
the
questions
they
had,
they
said,
well,
how
does
that
work
given
that
the
fish
and
wildlife
freely
migrate
from
areas
outs
xx
the
state
of
alaska
to
areas
inside
the
state
of
alaska?
i
mean,
a
lot
of
the
most
valuable
resources,
of
course,
are
things
like
salmon
or
arctic
char,
which
essentially
spawn
in
fresh
water
and
then
go
to
sea
for
several
years
and
come
back,
and
they
said,
well,
you
know,
how
would
you
expect
interior
to
be
able
to
construe
these
two
totally
different
schemes?
we
have
aboriginal
title
outside
the
three
miles,
and
you
have
the
statutory
protections
inside,
and
how
do
you
fit
those
two
together?
that
seemed
to
be
a
great
concern
to
them.
our
position
has
been
that
their
decision
really
can't
be
criticized
insofar
as
it
did
construe
those
same
terms
in
the
two
statutes
consistently.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
well,
your
honor,
what
we
have--
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
what
we
concede
is
that
for
purposes
of
international
law
and
technical
interpretations
of
international
law,
that
the
united
states
does
not
claim
title
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
there
is
a
difference
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
a
difference
which
appears
to
be
particularly
significant,
particularly
in
this
case.
the
reason
for
that
is
essentially
twofold,
and
one
is
that
we
have
cited
several
statutes
to
the
court
where
the
united
states,
where
congress
has
essentially
enacted
statutes
which
explicitly
provide
that
the
outer
continental
shelf...
actually,
what
they
do
is,
they
use
the
term
"federal
lands"
and
then
they
say
"federal
lands
but
not
including",
and
federal
lands
they
defined
as
lands
to
which
the
united
states
holds
title,
but
then
they
go
on
to
say,
"and
this
does
not
include
federal
lands
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
"
and
we
have
given
the
court...
we
have
cited
two
cases
which
have
seemed
to
suggest
that
in
a
practical
sense
that
congress
often
treats
the
outer
continental
shelf
as
though
in
fact
it
does
have
title
to
that
area,
although
obviously
in
international
arenas
and
for
formal
purposes
it
would
not.
the
second
thing
that
i
think
is
also
fairly
persuasive
here
is
that
we
are
not...
for
purposes
of
this
case
we
don't
have
to
show
that
section
810
applies,
that,
in
other
words,
the
united
states
holds
title
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
all
we
have
to
show
is
that
they
are
leasing
an
interest
to
which
they
hold
title,
and
title
merely
denotes
the
ability
to
sell,
and
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
united
states
does
assert
that
it
holds...
that
it
does
have
the
authority
to
sell
leasehold
interests
to
the
mineral
resources
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
so,
our
point
is,
for
purposes
of
this
case
it
is
not
even
really
necessary
to
decide
that
congress
decided
that
it
held
title.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
well,
actually,
the
only...
there
is
a...
there
is
a--
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
--well--
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
--well,
they
did.
i
just
wanted
to
say
real
briefly...
well,
the
claims
settlement
act
mentioned
it
briefly,
and
it
is
not
important
here,
but
for
your
question,
in
section
1001,
which
is
title
10
of
the
conservation
act,
what
it
says
is
that
title
10
is
supposed
to
apply
to
all
federal
lands
which...
obviously
the
same
definition
that
title
8
applies
to,
and
then
it
says
"other
than
those
federal
lands
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
"
so
that
in
title
10,
section
1001,
there
is
a
very
specific
reference
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
and
the
reference
is
made
for
the
purposes
of
ensuring
that
the
ordinary
definition
which
applies
to
title
8
does
not
ensure
that
title
10
applies
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
well,
if
they,
if...
i
mean,
as
a
matter--
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
--well,
as
a
matter
of
logic
if
the
term--
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
--well,
if
federal
lands
applies,
includes
within
its
definition
the
outer
continental
shelf,
then
obviously
there
is
no
reason
to
say
that
this
title
applies
to
federal
lands
and
the
outer
continental
shelf.
you
would
only
want
to
add--
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
--that
is
correct.
the
only
mention
is
in
the
section
that
i
have
just
cited
to
you.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
no,
your
honor,
i
will
turn
to
that
now.
our
position
on
the
injunction
is
that,
just
to
start
off,
that
there
are
some
substantial
violations
of
section
810.
section
810
has
two
sentences.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
violations
of
the
first
sentence--
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
your
honor,
without
getting
into
my
personal
feelings
about
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
its
decision,
what
i
would
say
is
that
i
think
its
decision
is
fully
consistent
with
romero-barcello,
and
by
that
what
i
say
is
that
it
seemed
to
me,
and
of
course
you
would
have
a
much
better
idea
than
i
would,
that
romero-barcello
says...
it
relies
on
tva
v.
hill
and
it
says
what
has
to
happen
is
that
analytically
we
have
to
look
at
the
statute
to
see
whether
an
injunction
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
in
tva
v.
hill,
given
the
statutory
language
and
so
forth
that
an
injunction
was
the
appropriate
remedy,
and
then
it
looked
at
the
clean
water
act,
and
under
the
clean
water
act
the
normal
violation,
the
normal
remedy
for
a
violation
of
the
clean
water
act
would
essentially
be
an
order
which
the
environmental
protection
agency
would
obtain
which
would
require
compliance
at
a
future
date.
and
this
court's
decision
in
romaro
barcello
basically
says,
well,
if
that
is
the
normal
remedy
for
a
violation
of
the
clean
water
act,
then
surely
that
should
be...
the
court
should
have
that
remedy
available
for
a
violation
of
the
clean
water
act
by
the
government,
so
we
think
that
if
you
apply
that
framework,
which
is
to
actually
look
at
the
language
of
section
810,
section
810
sets
out
with
some
specificity
the
timing
that
certain
studies
and
that
certain
findings
and
hearings
and
so
forth
have
to
be
made.
it
requires
that
some
of
the
things
be
done
before
the
decision
to
lease
is
made.
in
the
second
sentence
it
says
that
other
things
have
to
be
done
before
the
lease
is
issued...
excuse
me.
it
says,
effected,
but
in
the
leasing
context
that
would
be
issued.
and
our
position
is
is
that
given
that
statutory
language,
that
if
the
interior
has
failed
to
follow
that,
that
obviously
the
only
way
to
remedy
that
would
be
a
preliminary
injunction.
interestingly,
we
were
not
the
ones
in
the
court
of
appeals
who
argued
for
an
injunction.
what
our
position
was
was
that
since
it
was
impossible
to
comply,
since
congress
had
obviously
determined
that
the
timing
of
compliance
was
extremely
important,
our
position
was
that
it
was
extremely
important,
that
our
proper
remedy
was
an
order
voiding
the
sale.
the
government
and
the
oil
companies
came
back
and
they
said,
oh,
no,
the
proper
remedy
is
not
to
void
the
sale.
it
is
to
issue,
to
enjoin
activity
until
such
time
as
interior
complies
with
the
statute.
so
in
some
senses
we
are
in
a
little
bit
of
an
odd...
then
we
went
back
on
the
remand
and
we
sent
it
to
the
district
court
and
we
said,
look,
your
remand
order
says,
decide
whether
to
void
the
sale
or
whether
to
enjoin
further
exploration
and
development
until
interior
complies,
and
pending
that
decision,
we
think
you
should
issue
a
preliminary
injunction.
of
course,
now
we
are
here
defending
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
but
that
was
not
the
remedy
that
we
requested.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
s.
cooper
i
think
that
is
very
true,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
arguments
about
the
geographic
scope
of
the
claims
settlement
act
have
been
presented
as
fully
as
they
would
in
a
separate
case,
yes.
thank
you.
