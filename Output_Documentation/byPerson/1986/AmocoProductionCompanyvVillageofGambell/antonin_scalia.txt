justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
the
810
issue
would
dispose
of
the
entire
case?
what
about
the
point,
that
the
native
rights
were
preserved
in
the...
which
the
ninth
circuit
never
had
to
reach
because
of
the
way
it
came
out
on
the
810
issue?
what
do
we
do
with
that
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
it
is
not
before
this
court,
but
it
was
before
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
disposed
of
it
in
a
way
that
hinged,
it
seems
to
me,
upon
its
disposition
of
the
810
issue.
shouldn't
these
challengers
have
the
right
before
some
court
to
have
that
issue
disposed
of
and
not
simply
assumed
one
way
or
the
other?
there
was
no
cross-petition,
was
there?
there
is
a
cross-petition.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
dispose
of
it,
but
would
it
dispose
of
it
fairly?
has
the
point
ever
been
considered
by
the
ninth
circuit
by
any
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
put
not
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
quite
one
thing
for
a
court,
specifically
the
ninth
circuit,
to
hold
that
the
native
claims
settlement
act
applies...
does
not,
apply
or
covers...
well,
the
ninth
circuit
is
assuming
that
the
coverage
of
the
two
statutes
are
identical.
isn't
that
correct?
and
you
want
us
to
disagree
with
the
ninth
circuit
as
to
one
but
affirm
the
ninth
circuit's
position
as
to
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
had
the
ninth
circuit
known
that
you
were
going
to
interpret
the
native
claims...
that
we
are
going
to
interpret
the
native
claims
settlement
act
in
that
fashion...
or,
excuse
me,
anilca
in
the
fashion
you
are
urging
us
to
interpret
it,
it
might
have
interpreted
the
native
claims
settlement
act
in
a
different
fashion.
isn't
that
correct?
it
viewed
the
two
as
going
pari
passu,
didn't
it?
and
you
want
us
to
affirm...
or
to
reverse
them
on
one-half
of
that
equivalency,
but
just
let
their
decision
stand
on
the
other
half
without
giving
them
a
chance
to
consider
whether
given
the
fact
that
we
now
say
the
two
don't
necessarily
go
together,
they
should
come
out
the
same
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be
true.
i
am
not
disputing
that
on
the
merits.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
this.
is
it
fair
to
the
ninth
circuit
or
to
the
litigants
if
the
ninth
circuit
based
its
decision
concerning
the
scope
of
the
claims
settlement
act
upon
an
assumption
of
equivalency
of
coverage
between
that
and
anilca?
can
we
eliminate
that
presumption
and
yet
not
give
the
ninth
circuit
a
chance
to
reconsider
what
its
position
on
the
native
claims
settlement
act
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
point,
whether
it
extends
elsewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
is
sort
of
hard
to
base
or
decision
here
on
that
point
when
there
is
a
cross-petition
pending
without
granting
that
cross-petition,
just
decide
the
issue
without
granting
the
cross-petition.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cooper,
we
don't
really
have
this
issue
before
us,
do
we?
i
mean,
we
are
still
thinking
about
whether
we
want
to
decide
this
issue
that
you
are
arguing
right
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
shouldn't
decide
that
neither
applies
when
we
haven't
agreed
to
hear
argument
on
whether
one
of
them
applies.
we
have
just
agreed
to
hear
argument
on
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cooper,
when
the
ninth
circuit
originally
decided
that
issue--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
case
several
years
ago--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
that
issue
tied
to
the
issue
that
is
before
us
today?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
wait.
your
argument
about
the
two
statutes,
now,
the
ninth
circuit
doesn't
agree
with
your
argument
as
to
how
the
two
statutes
fit
together,
does
it?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
they
are
coextensive.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
they
are
not
coextensive.
you
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
who
is
before
us
arguing
for
the
more
narrow
interpretation
of
the
claims
settlement
act?
nobody.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
two
years
ago
held
that
the
claims
settlement
act
had
a
broad
interpretation,
did
it
have
before
it
at
the
same
time
anilca?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
said
at
that
same
time
that
that
also
had
a
broad
interpretation?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cooper,
before
you
sit
down,
i
wanted
to
get
one
thing
clear
on
this
question
of
whether
we
can
reach
the
claims
settlement
act
or
not,
whether
it
is
before
us
and
so
forth.
mr.
bruce
said
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
the
issues
relating
to
the
scope
of
the
claims
settlement
act
have
been
argued
here
as
extensively
as
they
would
be
argued
in
any
case.
are
you
satisfied
to
the
same
effect?
