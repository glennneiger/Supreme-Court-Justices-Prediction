mr.
cooper,
there
is
one
significant
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
that
you
haven't
addressed,
and
that
is
that
in
anilca
the
statute
defines
public
lands,
and
it
defines...
it
uses
the
term
"federal
lands"
and
goes
on
and
defines
federal
lands
as
lands
the
title
to
which
is
in
the
united
states.
and
i
suppose
you
concede
that
the
united
states
does
not
have
title
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
the
claims
settlement
act
i
guess
the
act
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
title
in
the
united
states,
does
it?
i
mean,
that
is
a
difference
in
the
acts.
