mr.
e.
edward
bruce
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
devote
my
remarks
exclusively
to
the
question
of
anilca's
application
to
the
ocs,
and
in
doing
so
i
think
will
address
the
concerns
of
justice
scalia
and
justice
o'connor
regarding
the
reconciliation
of
these
two
statutes.
it
is
important
to
understand
anilca's
role
in
the
entire
scheme
of
things
within
alaska
land
legislation.
there
are
three
key
acts,
the
statehood
act
of
1958,
the
1971
claims
settlement
act,
and
then
anilca.
all
three
use
the
term
"public
lands".
in
all
three
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
that
term
pertains
exclusively
to
lands
within
alaska
and
cannot
extend
to
the
ocs.
the
statehood
act
gave
alaska
the
right
to
select
about
100
million
acres
of
public
lands
in
alaska.
it
has
always
been
recognized
that
those
lands
selected
by
the
states
had
to
be
exclusively
on
shore
lands.
the
'71
claims
settlement
act
dealt
with
complications
that
arose
in
the
course
of
alaska's
selection
of
its
lands
arising
from
native
claims
and
arising
from
conservationist
concerns
to
preserve
certain
federal
lands
and
parks
and
the
like.
that
was
done
in
section
17(d)(2)
of
the
claims
settlement
act.
that
act
directed
the
united
states
to
withdraw
80
million
acres
of
public
lands.
it
also
gave
the
state
and
the
natives
a
right
to
select
from
the
public
lands
lands
in
satisfaction
of
the
state's
statehood
act
rights
and
lands
in
satisfaction
of
the
native
claims
rights.
again,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
public
lands
there
did
not
extend
to
the
ocs.
anilca
completed
that
process.
it
put
about
120
million
acres
of
public
lands,
again,
lands
within
the
state,
in
parks,
refuges,
and
the
like.
it
did
that
in
titles
2
through
7.
it
is
perfectly
clear
those
public
lands
are
lands
within
the
state.
it
is
also
clear
that
whenever
that
phrase
was
used
in
other
provisions
of
the
statute
it
pertained
exclusively
to
lands
within
the
state.
for
example,
section
906
of
the
statute,
which
is
43
usc
1635(b),
extends
the
state's
land
selection
rights
to
public
lands
for
an
additional
ten
years,
and
it
also
gives
the
state
of
alaska
75,000
acres
of
additional
lands,
again,
public
lands.
perfectly
clear
these
public
lands
are
lands
within
the
state,
not
the
ocs.
title
8,
the
subsistence
provision,
uses
the
same
term
"public
lands".
the
subsistence
protection
of
the
statute
pertains
exclusively
to
public
lands.
the
legislative
history
was
very
clear
that
what
the
natives
wanted
was
extension
of
subsistence
protection,
not
just
to
those
120
million
acres
of
lands
within
parks
and
refuges
but
also
to
all
remaining
public
lands
in
alaska,
on
shore
lands,
not
the
ocs.
the
specific
definition
formulated
by
congress
regarding
the
meaning
of
public
lands
reinforces
the
natural
conclusions
that
one
draws
when
one
understands
anilca's
role
in
the
legislative
process.
public
lands
are
lands
situated
in
alaska.
they
are
lands
to
which
the
united
states
asserts
title.
the
ocs
qualifies
under
neither
score.
now,
the
respondent's
entire
argument
really
in
this
case
is
that
because
under
section
4(b)
of
the
claims
settlement
act
their
claims
to
lands
on
the
ocs
were
extinguished,
then
the
subsistence
provisions
should
read
in
pari
materia.
they,
too,
they
say,
should
be
extended
to
the
ocs.
that
argument
misunderstands
and
overlooks
obvious
and
decisive
dissimilarities
between
the
two
statutes.
first,
the
native
claims
settlement
act
when
it
extinguished
lands
did
not
limit
its
application
to
public
lands.
it
extinguished
the
native
claims
to
all
lands,
whether
state-owned,
federally
owned,
or
privately
held.
the
term
4(b).
second,
that
statute
was
specifically
written...
by
that
statute
i
mean
section
4(b)
of
the
claims
settlement
act,
specifically
included
submerged
lands
underneath
all
water
areas,
both
inland
and
offshore,
and
that
specific
reference
in
the
statute
was
in
response
to
testimony
offered
to
congress
during
the
claims
settlement
act
which
said
we
should
extinguish
offshore
claims
as
well
as
onshore
claims.
anilca,
by
sharp
contrast,
has
nothing
in
it
whatever
on
its
face
or
in
its
legislative
history
that
suggests
in
any
way
that
it
should
extend
to
the
ocs.
there
is
no
need
or
no
point
in
remanding
this
case
to
the
ninth
circuit
for
further
consideration
in
the
light
of
this
court's
proper
construction
of
section
810.
this
court
can
in
this
case
render
a
construction
of
section
810
of
anilca
that
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
while
it
extends
only
to
lands
in
alaska,
as
the
statute
indicates,
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
the
other
statute
might
extend
elsewhere.
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
point.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
what
we
ask
you
to
do
is
decide
the
proper
construction
of
section
810
and
then
ask
the
court
in
due
consideration
of
a
pending
cross-petition
to
take
that
into
account
as
it
decides
to
dispose
of
that
cross-petition
in
an
appropriate
way.
let
me
turn
very
briefly,
and
i
would
like
to
save
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
can,
to
the
nontextual
arguments
that
the
petitioner,
or,
excuse
me,
the
respondents
advance.
they
say
that
this
was
indian
law
and
should
be
liberally
construed
in
their
favor,
the
subsistence
provision
of
anilca.
well,
it
is
indian
law
in
a
sense,
but
it
is
indian
law
in
a
special
sense.
section
810
is
only
one
section
in
a
massive
statute
that
uses
the
same
term,
"public
lands",
throughout.
you
can't
adopt
an
expansive
construction
of
it
for
title
8
and
wreak
havoc
throughout
the
rest
of
the
statute
by
a
principle
of
resolving
ambiguities
in
favor
of
native
americans.
secondly,
that
principle
only
takes
you
so
far.
it
cannot
take
you
to
the
point
of
overlooking
the
plain
language
and
clear
legislative
history
of
the
statute
as
you
would
have
to
do
to
adopt
their
reading
of
the
statute
here.
finally,
they
argue
that
anilca
is
a
general
subsistence
protection
measure,
and
it
should
be
liberally
construed
to
protect
them.
it
is
not
a
general
subsistence
protection
measure.
it
is
a
very
special
statute.
it
is
limited
to
the
disposition
of
federal
public
lands
in
alaska,
and
that
is
all
it
applies
to.
there
are
other
statutes
that
protect
subsistence
on
the
ocs
as
elsewhere.
nepa
protects.
the
endangered
species
act
protects.
all
those
statutes
were
complied
with
in
this
case.
no
one
has
argued
to
the
contrary
in
this
court.
so
the
general
subsistence
protection
is
provided
elsewhere,
not
in
anilca.
we
will
rest
on
the
arguments
that
we
have
regarding
the
ninth
circuit's
two
other
mistakes
pertaining
to
anilca
by
virtue
of
what
we
have
said
in
our
briefs,
because
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
on
the
basic
question
of
anilca's
application
to
the
ocs
it
need
not
reach
those
questions.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
yes,
i
would
like
first
to
respond
to
justice
scalia's
comment.
i
have
not
said
that
the
settlement
act
issues
have
been
fully
briefed
at
this
point
in
this
court.
we
have
not
briefed
them
at
all.
we
haven't
briefed
them
because
they
are
not
in
the
case.
secondly,
i
reiterate
that
there
is
a
dispositive
difference
in
the
scope
of
these
two
statutes.
the
claims
settlement
act
extinguishment
provisions
are
not
limited
to
public
lands,
and
further
that
the
claims
settlement
act
was
written
very
explicitly
to
pertain
to
submerged
lands
underneath
water
areas
both
inland
and
offshore.
the
subsistence
provisions
of
anilca
were
not
so
limited.
counsel
made
reference
to
section
1001's
exclusion--
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
--yes.
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
your
honor,
this
is
covered
fully
in
the
gamble
i
opinion
at
page
577,
volume
746
of
fed
2nd
where
mr.
john
pickering,
then
a
spokesperson
for
a
group
interested
in
the
claims
settlement
act,
made
the
point
very
explicitly
that
this
would
extend
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
the
ninth
circuit
understood
that.
there
is
really
no
ambiguity.
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
perfectly
clear.
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
i
guess
finally
i
would
note
that
counsel
says
there
would
be
no
great
disruption
if
the
claims
settlement
act
were
extended
to
the
ocs.
well,
in
fact,
of
course,
there
have
been
over
$4
billion
worth
of
leases
that
have
been
purchased
over
time
in
connection
with
offshore
oil
and
gas
activities
in
alaska.
that
would
be
disrupted
both
by
such
an
application
of
that
statute
and
by
the
application
of
anilca,
for
that
matter,
to
this
area.
anilca
is
clear
that
it
does
not
apply
to
the
ocs.
this
court
should
so
hold.
it
is
also
clear
that
the
ninth
circuit
totally
disregarded
this
court's
opinion
in
weinberger
versus
romaro
barcello
and
this
court
should
so
hold
so
as
to
cure
that
or
remove
that
so-called
ninth
circuit
rule
that
ignores
that
precedent.
thank
you
very
much.
