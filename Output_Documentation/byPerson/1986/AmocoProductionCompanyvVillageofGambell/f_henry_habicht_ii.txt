mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
the
ninth
circuit's
entry
of
a
preliminary
injunction
against
oil
and
gas
exploration
activities
in
two
areas
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lying
between
25
and
350
miles
from
the
coast
of
alaska.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
denial
of
a
preliminary
injunction
here.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
overrule
the
express
district
court
findings
of
no
irreparable
harm,
and
that
the
balance
of
harms
counseled
against
entry
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
rather,
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
that
these
findings
did
not,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
"excuse
the
district
court's
duty
to
enter
an
injunction.
"
based
upon
the
ninth
circuit
rule
that
absent
unusual
circumstances
an
injunction
must
issue
when
the
court
finds
a
procedural
violation
of
an
environmental
or
a
conservation
statute.
the
environmental
statute
said
to
be
violated
here
is
section
810
of
the
alaska
national
interest
lands
conservation
act,
or
anilca,
which
provides
for
a
consideration
of
impacts
on
subsistence
activities
in
certain
federal
decisions
concerning
the
use
of
public
lands.
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
that
even
though
the
secretary
of
interior
had
analyzed
subsistence
impacts
at
length
in
the
environmental
impact
statement
for
these
lease
sales,
section
810
of
anilca,
which
by
its
terms
applies
to
public
lands
in
alaska,
requires
the
secretary
separately
to
comply
with
that
provision
before
leasing
outer
continental
shelf
tracts
lying
as
much
as
350
miles
offshore.
today
we
will
argue
two
points
developed
in
our
briefs.
first,
that
the
ninth
circuit
rule
automatically
requiring
injunctions
for
certain
statutory
violations
is
without
basis.
second,
that
in
anilca
congress
never
intended
the
terms
"public
lands
in
alaska"
to
govern
activities
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
these
lands...
i
would
be
happy
to,
mr.
chief
justice.
these
lands
are
located
in
the
bering
sea
southwest
of
nome,
alaska.
the
norton
basin
area,
which
is
sale
57,
lies
about
25
miles
from
the
coast.
the
navarin
basin,
which
is
the
area
covered
by
sale
83
in
this
case,
lies
as
much
as
350
miles
from
the
coast
of
alaska.
it
is
due
west,
at
the
western
end
of
the
bering
sea,
lying
adjacent
to
the
border
with
the
soviet
union.
even
assuming
that
section
810
applies
to
these
leased
sales,
the
ninth
circuit
requirement
of
a
preliminary
injunction
here
is
flatly
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
weinberger
versus
romaro
barcelo,
which
we
submit
is
controlling.
this
court
in
weinberger
thoroughly
reviewed
the
history
and
the
principles
of
equity
jurisprudence,
and
said
clearly
that
while
violations
of
the
law
will
not
be
ignored,
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
an
injunction
requires
a
particularized
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
of
each
case,
including
at
a
minimum
a
finding
of
irreparable
harm.
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
the
weinberger
inquiry
here
and
the
district
court's
express
findings
in
favor
of
a
generalized
rule
that
a
procedural
violation
of
an
environmental
statute
alone
can
warrant
injunctive
relief.
this
notion
of
a
duty
to
enter
an
injunction
without
findings
of
irreparable
harm
on
its
face
conflicts
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
weinberger.
and
there
are
no
alternative
grounds
for
sustaining
the
ninth
circuit
decision
here.
given
the
teaching
of
weinberger
and
a
host
of
other
decisions
of
this
court
concerning
equity
jurisprudence,
the
district
court's
findings
here
can
only
be
reversed
on
one
of
two
grounds.
first,
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
which
is
the
traditional
standard
of
review
of
a
denial
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
or,
second,
that
congress
removed,
clearly
removed
the
district
court's
discretion,
in
this
case
in
anilca
by
specifically
requiring
injunctive
relief
in
all
cases
without
regard
to
the
circumstances.
first,
there
can
be
no
finding
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
this
record.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
overrule
the
express
findings
of
the
district
court
concerning
irreparable
harm
or
balance
of
harms.
it
simply
ruled
that
these
findings
were
irrelevant.
second,
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
weinberger
was
inapplicable
and
therefore
did
not
attempt
to
determine
as
weinberger
dictates
whether
in
section
810
congress
specifically
intended
to
curtail
district
court
discretion.
here
there
is
no
express
language
that
has
been
cited
nor
legislative
history
to
support
that
proposition.
in
fact,
in
the
senate
report
to
anilca
which
served
as
the
conference
reports,
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
23,
the
report
says
that
a
proposed
action
may
proceed
even
in
the
face
of
findings
of
potential
harm
to
subsistence
resources.
this
kind
of
language
hardly
meets
this
court's
requirement
of
either
express
intent,
express
statements,
or
a
necessary
and
inescapable
inference
that
congress
intended
to
withdraw
traditional
equitable
discretion
from
the
district
court.
this
language
and
the
context
of
section
810
is
strikingly
similar
to
that
of
the
clean
water
act
reviewed
by
this
court
in
weinberger.
the
clean
water
act
also
in
quite
mandatory
terms
prohibited
the
discharge
of
pollutants
without
a
permit.
the
court
in
weinberger
ruled
that
an
injunction
was
not
required
based
upon
findings
of
no
irreparable
harm
to
water
quality
in
that
case
and
that
the
compliance
proposals
were
fully
consistent
with
the
goals
of
the
clean
water
act.
this
is
precisely
such
a
case.
respondents
have
argued
that
tva
versus
hill
requires
a
different
result
here.
but
in
fact
this
court
in
tva
versus
hill
engaged
in
precisely
the
sort
of
inquiry
outlined
in
weinberger.
the
court
expressly
found
that
there
would
be...
that
a
critical
habitat
of
the
small
guider,
an
endangered
species
in
that
case,
would
be
destroyed
by
the
closing
of
the
teleco
dam.
secondly,
the
court
ruled
at
page
193
of
437
united
states
reports,
that
the
finding
that
the
very
object
of
the
substantive
protections
of
the
endangered
species
act
was
going
to
be
extirpated
in
the
words
of
the
court,
didn't
necessarily
dictate
the
remedy.
the
court
then
engaged
in
an
inquiry
into
the
legislative
history
of
the
endangered
species
act
and
other
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
find
that
congress
explicitly,
beyond
doubt
in
the
words
of
the
court,
struck
the
balance
in
that
case
in
favor
of
saving
this
endangered
species
which
was
in
fact
going
to
be
extirpated.
here,
as
we
have
already
noted,
the
district
court
found
that
there
would
be
no
harm
from
exploration
activities
to
subsistence
resources
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
off
alaska.
finally,
the
factual
and
statutory
context
here
demonstrates
why
it
is
important
to
examine
all
the
elements
in
the
traditional
preliminary
injunction
test.
the
fact,
for
example,
the
fact
that
this
action
is
proceeding
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
amendments
of
1978
is
not
irrelevant.
first
of
all,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
amendments
bear
on
the
determination
of
the
public
interest
in
an
equitable
proceeding.
as
this
court
recognized
in
secretary
of
interior
versus
california,
congress
intended
to
promote
the
expedited
exploration
of
the
resources
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
the
united
states
outer
continental
shelf
of
which
two-thirds
lies
offshore
alaska.
second,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
bears
directly
on
the
remedial
calculus
here,
because
as
this
court
also
recognized
in
secretary
of
interior
versus
california,
congress
explicitly
segmented
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
process
into
discrete
stages
so
that
information
about
resources
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
could
be
developed
without
undue
risk
to
environmental
or
human
resources.
congress
made
clear
that
development
may
never
occur
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
without
a
separate
approval
and
separate
environmental
analysis
before
any
development
plans
are
approved.
therefore
this
structure
is
indeed
directly
relevant
to
determining
the
necessity
and
the
appropriate
scope
of
an
equitable
remedy
in
this
case.
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
is
not
dispositive
with
regard
to
the
public
interest.
the
proper
relief
in
a
given
case
is
going
to
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
harm
and
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
before
the
district
court,
here,
as
we
have
noted,
subsistence
evaluations
were
made
by
the
secretary
both
before
the
lease
sales
and
then
under
section
810
after
each
of
the
lease
sales
here.
the
district
court
expressly
found
no
harm
to
subsistence
resources
from
the
exploration
stage,
and
also
noted
that
production
and
development
could
not
occur
until
there
would
be
further
environmental
review
and
further
approvals,
and
also
noted
that
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
the
authority
to
shape
and
control
the
outer
continental
shelf
leasing
process,
including
cancelling
leases
if
significant
harm
to
the
environment
or
social
harm
is
presented.
given
all
of
these
circumstances
and
the
ample
protection
for
subsistence
here
the
goals,
the
statutory
goals
of
congress
in
section
810
of
anilca
can
be
met
without
shutting
down
the
lease
sales.
turning
to
the
second
point,
turning
to
the
second
major
area
of
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
--in
our
view,
justice
stevens,
both
the
scope
and
the
applicability
of
section
810
to
this
sale
and
the
ninth
circuit
preliminary
injunction
rule
both
should
be
addressed
by
the
court.
they
are
both--
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
--well,
in
kleppe
versus
sierra
club
we
had
similar
circumstances.
in
that
case
there
was
an
allegation
of
a
nepa
violation
with
regard
to
interior's
coal
leasing
program,
and
there
was
also
an
issue
of
the
propriety
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
preliminary
injunction
there.
in
that
case
the
court
found
in
favor
of
the
secretary
on
the
nepa
issue
and
then
proceeded
to
note
that
the
preliminary
injunction
in
any
event,
even
if
nepa
had
applied
in
those
circumstances,
would
have
been
inappropriate.
so
we
think
it
is
not...
it
is
not
an
advisory
opinion
in
the
sense
that
both
issues
are
currently
live.
they
have
been
fully
briefed
before
the
court.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
it
is
true,
justice
stevens.
if
we
win--
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
--the
preliminary
injunction
argument
has
the
broadest
significance.
it
is
a
rule
that
has
been
well
ingrained
in
ninth
circuit
jurisprudence
and
has
led
to
in
our
view
a
number
of
inappropriate
preliminary
injunctions
without
equitable
findings.
i
would
say
that
in
this
case,
justice
stevens,
the
810
issue
would
dispose
of
the
entire
case
whereas
the
preliminary
injunction
issue
would
require
further
proceedings
to
determine
the
applicability
of
anilca,
so
the
810
issue
is
the
one
that
would
dispose
of
the
case--
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
--and
that
we
would
urge
on
the
court.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
we
will
certainly
take
either,
and
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reach
both
because
it
is
so
seldom
that
a
preliminary
injunction
issue
comes
before
this
court.
it
has,
as
it
were,
a
short
shelf
life.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
if
you
address
only
the
preliminary
injunction
issue
there
would
be
further
proceedings.
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
i
agree.
i
wouldn't
urge
the
court,
not
to
reach
an
issue
which
we
think
is
appropriately
before
the
court
that
would
dispose
of
the
entire
cases
and
the
810
issue
would
indeed
dispose
of
the
entire
case.
again,
though,
as
the
court
did
in
kleope
v.
sierra
clubs
a
ruling
on
the
very
concretely
presented
preliminary
injunction
issue
is
extremely
important
as
well
to
a
number
of
activities
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
well,
the
issue
of
whether
aboriginal
title
remains
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
is
in
our
view,
justice
scalla,
not
before
the
court.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
there
was
a
cross-petition.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
on
that
very
issue
and
it
is
still
pending
before
the
court,
so
if
this
court
were
to
deny
the
cross-petition,
that
would
dispose
in
our
view
of
the
aboriginal
title
issue.
it
hasn't
been...
the
petition
hasn't,
been
granted,
so
it
is
not
currently
before
the
court.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
the
point
has
been
considered
in
the
inupiat
community
case,
i
believe,
about
three
years
ago
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
it
was
considered
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
gamble,
the
decision
in
gamble
i,
and
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
there
was
no
longer
any
aboriginal
title
in
the
outer
continental
shelf.
that
was
an
explicit
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
gamble
i,
and
that
is
the
subject
of
the
cross-petition
which
is
still
pending
before
the
court.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
no,
it
wouldn't
constitute
a
ruling
on
the
merits
but
having
a
definitive
ninth
circuit
ruling
on
the
subject,
and
the
ninth
circuit
had
also
ruled
previously
in
the
inupiat
case
in
which
this
court
denied
cert,
so
in
our
view
the
issue
has
been
squarely
presented
on
at
least
two
occasions
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
rejected
the
contention.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
we
presume
that
the
ninth
circuit
precedent
would
be
followed
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
briefly,
with
regard
to
the
section
810
issue
which
we
again
believe
is
dispositive
it
is
clear
the
legislative
evidence
is
compelling
that
congress
never
intended
silently
to
extend
the
term
350
miles
off-shore.
the
express
language
of
the
statute
is
dispositive
in
our
view.
title
8
and
section
810
of
anilca
apply
only
to
public
lands,
a
defined
term
used
throughout
anilca
and
other
land
selection
and
withdrawal
statutes
such
as
the
alaska
statehood
act,
the
native
claims
settlement
acts
and
a
number
of
other
federal
land
statutes.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
no,
justice
o'connor,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
strictly
applies
to
land
outside
the
three-mile
boundary,
and
those
lands
have
never
been
termed
public
lands
in
any
court
or
congress.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
section
4(b)
of
the
native
claims
act
extinguishes
all
claims
to
lands
in
alaska
both
on-shore
and
off-shore,
including
submerged
lands,
so
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
has
never
been
termed
public
lands,
but
the
extinguishment
provisions
of
4(b)
of
the
native
claims
settlement
act
have
been
held
to
extend
offshore.
but
the
statutes
are
entirely
different.
in
fact,
we
are
aware
of
no
statute
which
has
ever
been
held
in
which
the
term
"public
lands"
has
ever
been
held
to
include
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
well,
the
coverage
of
the
native
claims...
we
are
asking
you
to
find
that
the
term
4(b)
of
the
native
claims
settlement
act--
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
--only
applies
on
shore,
which
it
has
been
found
to
apply
for
over
100
years
in
public
land
law
and
public
land
jurisprudence.
mr.
f.
henry
habicht,
ii
justice
scalia,
in
our
view
the
scope
of
section
4(b)
of
the
native
claims
settlement
act,
9
and
i
would
note
that
the
rest
of
the
native
claims
settlement
act
refers
only
to
the
selection
of
public
lands
in
alaska,
in
our
view,
the
scope
of
section
4(b)
is
not
relevant
to
what
congress
intended
in
anilca.
this
court
is
being
asked
to
determine
what
congress
intended
in
anilca
when
it
used
the
term
90
percent,
of
the
statute,
and
the
subsistence
provisions.
now,
in
our
view,
because
in
anilca
the
court.
--the
congress
talked
about...
defined
public

it
enacted

think

thank
you.
