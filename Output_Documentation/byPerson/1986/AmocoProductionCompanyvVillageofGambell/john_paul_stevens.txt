justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
as
you
make
your
transition?
which
question
do
you
think
we
should
address
first?
you
decided
to
address
the
remedy
issue
first.
do
you
think
that
is
the
appropriate
question
for
us
to
address
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
win
on
one
there
is
no
need
to
address
the
other.
do
you
want
us
to
just
give
you
an
advisory
opinion
on
one
of
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
if
you
win
on
one
you
have
won
the
lawsuit?
we
don't
have
to
address
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
be
decide
we
only
need
to
address
one,
which
do
think
we
should
address?
do
you
have
a
preference?
you
argued
the
preliminary
injunction
one
first.
is
that
because
you
think
it
is
your
strongest
argument,
or
you
think
logically
it
comes
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
our
denial
of
cert...
that
wouldn't
constitute
a
ruling
on
the
merits
of
the
issue,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
you
are
really
saying
is,
i
suppose,
if
we
deny
cert
and
it
remains
open
in
the
ninth
circuit
they
presumably
will
follow
their
precedence
in
the
earlier
cases.
that's
the
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that
last
point,
to
what
extent
does
the
record
or
the
legislative
history
show
that
the
offshore
goes
beyond
three
miles?
you
are
talking
about
section
4(b),
i
think,
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can't
that
be
read,
if
you
interpret
"in
alaska"
narrowly
as
just
referring
to
the
immediate
area
immediately
offshore?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that
is
perfectly
clear
from
mr.
pickering's
presentation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
i
will
look
at
it
again.
