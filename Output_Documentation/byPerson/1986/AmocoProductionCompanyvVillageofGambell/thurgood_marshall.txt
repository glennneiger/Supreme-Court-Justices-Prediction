justice
thurgood
marshall
you
filed
a
petition
on
that,
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
is
still
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
is
not
before
us
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
on
your
petition
for
cert
without
granting
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
we
could
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
since
congress
knows
so
much
about
the
continental
shelf,
did
it
mention
it
in
any
three
of
these
statutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
saying
how
they
were
well
aware
of
it.
so
they
were
aware
of
the
continental
shelf
when
they
were
debating
this
point,
weren't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
mention
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow.
they
could
very
well
have
said
this
includes
or
does
not
include,
couldn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
knew
how
to
say
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
logic.
i
am
talking
about
fact.
justice
thurgood
marshall
every
time
it
says
public
lands
it
does
not
include
the
continental
shelf,
except
the
way
you
have
put
it.
