counsel,
is
it
possible,
since
the
court
below
didn't
really
decide
these
factual
questions
on
how
the
three-day
personal
leave
provision
was
in
fact
administered,
or
how
mr.
philbrook
was
treated
with
regard
to
it,
that
some
remand
might
be
necessary
on
the
703
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
it
looks
like
the
one
day
which
can
be
granted
on
the
request
of
the
teacher
alone
without
any
inquiry
at
all
would
lend
itself
to
use
for
any
purpose
whatever,
in
practice.
justice
sandra

o'connor
mr.
sullivan,
how
would
you
define
what
is
a
reasonable
accommodation
under
title
vii?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
take
the
position,
mr.
sullivan,
that
an
employer
who's
told
employees
they
could
have
no
time
off
for
any
personal
reason
or
any
religious
purpose
whatever,
except
to
the
extent
they
want
to
take
time
without
pay...
you
won't
lose
you
job,
but
you
can
take
the
time
off;
you
just
won't
be
paid
for
it.
is
that
a
reasonable
accommodation,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
paid
leave
for
any
purpose,
but
you
can
take
time
off
for
personal
or
religious
reasons,
without
pay.
is
that,
in
your
view,
a
reasonable
accommodation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sullivan,
would
an
employer's
policy
that
just
says,
across
the
board,
no
personal
leave
for
anyone
for
any
purpose,
meet
the
requirements
of
title
vii
for
religious
accommodation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rosen.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
reason
under
title
vii
why
the
accommodation
made
by
the
employer
cannot
be
broken
down
to
provide
so
many
days
a
year
sick
leave,
so
many
days
a
year
for
business
necessity,
and
so
many
days
a
year
for
religious
observance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
wouldn't
claim
that
that
kind
of
a
breakdown
is
inherently
discriminatory
under
title
vii?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
invalid
for
the
employer
to
say,
so
many
days
a
year
sick
leave,
so
many
days
a
year
secular-purpose
leave,
of
any
kind,
and
so
many
days
a
year
for
religious
observance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
the
fact-finder
determines
that
the
amount
given
for
religious
accommodation
is
in
fact
reasonable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
your
claim
under
section
703a-1,
or
whatever
it
is?
