well,
mr.
sullivan,
it
isn't
quite
right,
is
it,
that
the
normal
employee
would
get
all
18
days?
for
example,
it's
not
every
year
that
you
have
a
death
in
the
immediate
family,
a
family
funeral
to...
all
those,
i
assume,
happen
infrequently
rather
than
regularly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
it
true
that
except
for
the
three
days
of
personal
leave,
each
of
the
other
15
days
is
earmarked
for
a
specific,
narrow
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
the
question
is
whether
you
can
impose
the
limit
on
the
three
days
for
personal
leave
provision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
does
the
record
tell
us
how
frequently,
for
the
work
force
in
general,
the
personal
leave
privilege
was
exercised?
i
noticed
for
eight
years
in
a
row,
the
respondent
didn't
take
any
personal
leave.
do
most
employees
take
some?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rosen,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
facial
reading
of
the
contract?
i
happen
to
have
the
contract
in
the
cert
petition
at
page
4a
and
5a
before
me;
i
guess
that's
the
most
recent
one.
if
you
eliminated
the
provision
for
mandated
religious
observance
in
paragraph
10,
and
also
eliminated
subparagraph
4
of
the
exclusion
for
any
religious
observance,
but
retained
the
exclusion
for
all
other
purposes
set
forth
in
the
agreement,
would
that
contract
then
avoid
violating
title
vii?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
follow
up
with
another
question.
would
that
contract
be
more
or
less
favorable
to
your
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
let
me
ask
you
an
intermediate
question.
suppose
you
take
the
contract
as
it
is
and
merely
delete
the
words,
excluding
for
any
religious
observance,
but
retain
the
words,
purposes
set
forth
under
any
other
leave
provision,
which
would
of
course
have
the
same
effect.
would
that
be
facially
bad,
or
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
treat
the
religious
leave
just
like
all
other
kinds
of
leave.
put
that
would
be
explicitly
anti-religious.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
would
have
to
be
changed
to
say,
"you
don't
get
paid
for
time
reading
the
bible
in
the
lounge.
"
because
there's
no
specific
prohibition
against
it.
it's
only
that
you
don't
get
paid
for
those
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rosen,
would
you
tell
me
again,
because
i'm
not
really
sure
i
followed
your
argument,
whether
or
not,
and
if
not,
why
not,
just
striking
the
words,
any
religious
observance,
from
that
fourth
exclusion
would
satisfy
the
facial
attack,
even
though
it
would
leave
in
effect
the
general
exclusion
of
all
other
provisions
covered
by
leave.
tell
me
again
what
your
view
on
that
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
is
one
of
the
16
exclusions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
still
a
specific
religious
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
religion
is
like
other
things
for
which
leave
has
already
been
provided;
and
that's
discriminating
against
religion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
it
seems
to
me
possibly
you
could
win
the
case
and
have
that
provision
stricken,
and
you'd
be
right
back
where
you
started
from.
the
contract
would
have
precisely
the
same
meaning,
but
would
have
deleted
some
language
that
you
find
offensive.
i
just
don't
see
how
the
general
exclusion
of
all
other
leave
already
specifically
provided
for
can
be
said
to
be
a
religiously...
facially
discriminatory
against
religion.
that's
what
i
hang
on.
