justice
byron
r.
white
it
means
that
you
can't
be
in
school
and
some
place
else
at
the
same
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you
want
to
go
to
a
wedding,
like
yours,
i
mean,
like
the
teacher's.
you
know,
they
could
have
put
it
on
a
sunday
or
a
saturday.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
it
mean,
require
to
be
away
from
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
have
to
meet
my
mother-in-law
at
the
airport.
that
qualifies?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
yours?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
buying
a
house
and
i
want
to
be
present
when
the
engineer
looks
at
it
to
give
me
an
estimate
on
what
repairs
are
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
would
you
say
if
the
employer
gave
paid
leave
only
to
people
who
wanted
off
for
religious
purposes?
no
paid
leave
for
anybody
else
for
any
other
reason.
now,
is
that...
could
you
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
certainly
is
an
accommodation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
the
person
who
wants
personal
leave
off
for
some
other...
for
some
secular
purpose,
says,
mr.
employer,
you
give
this
fellow
time
off
for
going
to
church;
i
want
to
go
attend
a
class
at
the
university.
and
you're
discriminating
against
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
not
title
vii;
this
is
a
preference
for
religion.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
an
employer
could
do
that,
but
a
school
board
couldn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose,
if
the
employer
just
cut
out
the
three
days
for
religion
and
said,
three
days
for
personal
leave
of
any
kind,
including
religion;
that
would
satisfy
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
if
the
employer
said,
we
don't
have
any
leave
around
here
on
pay;
no
paid
leave
whatsoever.
but
there's
unpaid
leave
up
to
18
days
a
year
for
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
school
board
in
any
trouble
if
it
says,
no
paid
leave
for
anything
except
religion?
that's
not
a
title
vii
problem,
probably,
but
how
about
a
constitutional
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
give
three
days
paid
leave
for
religion,
but
no
paid
leave
for
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
think
that
title
vii
would
require
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
you
know
enough
about
what
personal
leave
is
allowed
for
in
this
specific
instance
to
say
that
it
discriminates
against
religion?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
object
to
the
remand?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
you'd
say--
justice
byron
r.
white
--anytime
you
permitted
paid
leave
for
a
wedding,
which
is
a
church
ceremony,
in
the
sense
that
you
aren't
considered
married
unless
you
get
married
in
the
church,
according
to
church
ritual,
if
you
allow
that,
you're
really
allowing...
shouldn't
you
also
allow
other
leave
for
religious
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
other
religious
activities?
