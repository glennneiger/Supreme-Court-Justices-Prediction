mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
two
issues
with
regard
to
the
provisions
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
which
prohibit
discrimination
by
an
employer
against
an
employee
because
of
his
religion.
the
first
issue
is
whether
an
employee
who
needs
to
be
absent
from
work
to
observe
his
religion,
and
who
is
provided
a
combination
of
paid
leave
and
unpaid
leave
for
that
purpose,
proves
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
under
title
vii,
based
upon
the
employer's
refusal
to
compensate
him
for
all
of
his
absence
for
religious
observance.
the
second
question
posed
is
whether
an
employer
who
has
implemented
a
reasonable
accommodation
of
an
employee's
religion,
is
nevertheless
required
to
accept
the
accommodation
the
employee
prefers,
absent
the
showing
of
undue
hardship
and
the
conduct
of
the
employer's
business.
now,
the
essential
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows:
the
respondent,
ronald
philbrook,
is
a
public
high
school
teacher,
employed
by
the
petitioner,
ansonia
school
board,
as
a
business
teacher.
since
1968,
philbrook
has
been
a
member
of
the
worldwide
church
of
god,
and
as
such,
he
is
required
by
his
faith
to
absent
himself
for
approximately
six
days
a
year
from
his
employment
to
observe
religious
holy
days.
under
the
governing
collective
bargaining
agreement,
all
of
the
school
board's
teachers,
including
philbrook,
are
provided
three
days
annual
paid
leave
for
religious
observance.
teachers
are
also
provided
under
the
agreement
with
18
days
of
annual
leave
for
other
reasons,
such
as
illness.
and
these
are
confined
to
specific
numbers
of
days
per
occurrence
per
reason.
teachers
are
also
provided,
in
addition
to
the
three
days
for
religious
observance
and
the
18
days
of
annual
leave,
with
three
days
of
annual
leave
for
necessary
personal
business.
under
the
specific
provisions
of
the
bargaining
agreement,
these
days
may
not
be
used
for
any
reason
for
which
leave
is
otherwise
provided
under
the
bargaining
agreement.
and
they
may
be
used
only
for
reasons
which
require
a
teacher's
absence
from
work.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
no,
it
wasn't.
your
honor,
early
on
in
the
bargaining
relationship
between
the
union
and
the
school
board,
the
leave
provisions
were
more
lenient
in
that
respect.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
'67
and
'68.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that.
the
evidence
in
terms
of
philbrook's
absences
for
religion
relate
back
to
the
1970-71
school
year,
which
you
can
see
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
record
is
not
clear
in
this
case
as
to
how
he
was
treated
prior
to
that
time.
it's
our
understanding
that
he
was
allowed,
up
until
the
1970-71
school
year,
all
of
the
leave
he
needed,
with
pay,
for
religious
observance.
so
that
the
change
came
when
the
parties
to
the
bargaining
agreement
negotiated
specific
restrictions
on
the
use
of
personal
leave.
now,
because
the
bargaining
agreement--
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
--your
honor,
we
don't
think
so,
and
for
this
reason:
we
feel
that
the
record
in
this
case
permits
no
other
conclusion
than
that
the
leave
provisions
of
the
contract
have
been
consistently
interpreted
in
accordance
with
the
explicit
provisions
of
the
contract
so
as
to
preclude
the
use
of
necessary
personal
business
leave.
and
that's
the
leave
we're
really
talking
about
here,
those
three
days
which
philbrook
claims
ought
to
be
allowed
for
religious
observance.
those
three
days,
under
the
contract,
cannot
be
used
for
any
reason
for
which
leave
is
otherwise
provided.
and
the
administration
of
the
school
system
has
determined--
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
--we
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
one
day
that
the
teacher
can
use
by
only
stating
the
reason
is
a
personal
reason
still
can
only
be
used
under
the
contract
for
reasons
which
require
the
teacher's
absence
from
work.
and
that
one
day,
even
though
discretionary
in
the
sense
that
the
teacher
need
only
state,
it's
for
a
personal
reason,
cannot
be
used
for
one
of
the
reasons
for
which
leave
is
otherwise
provided.
we
feel
the
contract
is
clear
on
that.
and
the
record
shows
that
the
superintendant
of
schools
strictly
enforced
these
leave
provisions.
there's
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
that's
correct.
a
teacher
can
be
disciplined
after
the
fact,
if
it's
found
out
that
the
day
was
improperly
used.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
we
don't
have
any
bargaining
history
on
that,
so
it's
simply
a
matter
of
conjecture.
but
i
would
say
yes.
in
collective
bargaining
agreements,
personal
day
leave
provisions,
it's
not
unusual
to
give
a
teacher
a
discretionary
day,
because
the
reason
may
be
so
personal
as
to
cause
embarrassment
if
it's
shared
with
anyone
else.
but
it
still
must
be
a
day
that
requires
the
teacher's
absence
from
work.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
it
means
that
the
business--
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
--no,
your
honor,
it
means,
i
think,
that
the
particular
reason--
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
--the
leave
provisions
do
provide
leave
for
weddings
already.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
the
interpretation
of
the
contract,
as
indicated
by
the
superintendant
of
schools
in
his
testimony,
is
that
the
reason
for
the
leave
must
concern
a
matter
than
cannot
be
handled
outside
the
workday.
so
in
that
sense,
it's
necessary
personal
business.
in
other
words,
arrangements
cannot
be
made
outside
of
work
to
conduct
that
particular
business.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
it
might
depend
on
the
consequences
of
not
meeting
your
mother-in-law.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
those
are
the
kind
of
judgment
calls,
obviously,
that
have
to
be
made
in
administering
these
kinds
of
provisions.
and
i
don't
think
you
can
make
a
conclusive
list,
in
this
area.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
if
the
arrangements
cannot
be
made
on
another
day,
then
that
might
very
well
constitute
necessary
personal
business.
now,
because
the
bargaining
agreement
limits
paid
leave
for
religious
observance
to
three
days
per
year,
and
philbrook
generally
needs
more,
the
school
board
has
allowed
philbrook
the
additional
time
off
without
pay.
dissatisfied
with
this
arrangement,
and
having
satisfied
the
jurisdictional
requirements,
philbrook
brought
suit
in
district
court,
claiming
a
violation
of
title
vii,
as
well
as
the
first
amendment,
based
on
the
school
board's
failure
to
compensate
him
in
some
way
for
all
of
his
days
of
leave
caused
for
religious
observance.
the
district
court
found
no
discrimination,
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
deciding
only
the
statutory
issue,
and
remanded
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
any
of
the
accommodations
proposed
by
philbrook
could
be
implemented
without
undue
hardships.
and
those
proposed
accommodations
essentially
involved
the
use
of
those
three
necessary
personal
leave
days
for
religious
observance,
or
the
payment
of
the
cost
of
a
substitute
teacher,
which
would
have
lessened
the
economic
impact
on
philbrook
for
having
to
take
that
time
off
without
pay.
philbrook
had
also
proposed
that
he
be
allowed
to
do
some
other
meaningful
work
in
conjunction
with
one
of
those
accommodations.
in
reversing
the
district
court
and
remanding
the
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
title
vii
requires
an
employer
to
accept
an
employee's
proposed
accommodation,
where
the
employer
and
the
employee
each
propose
a
reasonable
accommodation
to
the
employee's
religious
beliefs.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
the
reasonable
accommodation
provisions
as
necessarily
having
to
involve
a
determination
of
undue
hardship
on
the
employer,
the
theory
apparently
being
that
unless
there
is
some
hardship,
short
of
undue
hardship
on
an
employer,
the
employer
has
to
go
beyond
the
reason
accommodation
it
has
made,
and
consider
the
proposal
of
the
employee.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
yes,
i
think
so.
and
because
the
eeoc
regulations
guidelines...
not
regulations...
do
indicate
that
the
employer
has
to
attempt
to
implement
the
accommodation
which
least
disadvantages
the
employee
in
terms
of,
in
this
case,
compensation.
this
court
has,
of
course,
stated
on
several
occasions
that
the
eeoc
guidelines
do
not
have
the
force
of
law.
and
we
feel
that
the
guidelines,
in
that
particular
respect,
are
in
conflict
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
title
vii
makes
it
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
fail
or
refuse
to
hire
or
discharge
any
individual,
or
otherwise
to
discriminate
against
any
individual
with
respect
to
his
compensation,
terms,
or
conditions,
or
privileges
of
employment,
because
of
such
individual's
religion.
the
statute
defines
religion
to
include
all
aspects
of
religious
observance
and
practice,
as
well
as
belief,
unless
an
employer
demonstrates
that
he
is
unable
to
reasonably
accommodate
to
an
employee's
or
prospective
employee's
observance
or
practice
without
undue
hardship
on
the
conduct
of
the
employer's
business.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
your
honor,
i
would
define
a
reasonable
accommodation
as
one
that
resolves
the
conflict
between
the
employee's
religious
needs,
in
this
case
in
terms
of
religious
observance,
and
his
job
requirements.
and
that
is,
i
think,
the
crucial
factor
in
this
case.
because
the
employer
has
implemented
an
accommodation,
which
resolves
the
conflict
between
philbrook's
need
to
be
on
the
job
and
his
need
for
religious
observance,
a
reasonable
accommodation
has
been
made.
and
the
statute
has
been
satisfied
as
a
result.
consequently,
we
feel
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
determining
that
philbrook
had
not
established
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
now,
the
court
in
doing
that
implemented
a
three-pronged
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
court
said:
is
there
a
conflict
between
the
employee's
religious
needs
and
the
job
requirements?
secondly,
has
the
employer
informed
the
employee
of
his
conflict?
and
thirdly,
has
the
employee
been
disciplined
as
a
result
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
job
requirements.
in
this
case,
we
feel
there's
no
conflict,
as
i've
indicated
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
and
thirdly,
there's
been
no
discipline
in
any
sense.
certainly
philbrook's
not
been
discharged
from
his
employment.
he's
not
been
deprived
of
any
benefit
to
which
he
would
otherwise
have
been
entitled
except
for
his
religion.
he's
not
been
disciplined
in
any
way.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
if
the
employer
is
saying...
if
the
employer
provides
some
kind
of
paid
leave,
but
no
leave
for
religious
observance,
i
would
view
that
as
clearly
discriminatory.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
yes.
because
the
three-prong
test
of
religious...
to
determine
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
was
not
met
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
well,
we
don't.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
leave
provisions
are
under-inclusive,
in
the
sense
that
they
do
not
provide
philbrook
all
the
leave
he
needs
for
religious
observance,
is
determinative
of
the
issue.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
title
vii
requires
an
employer
to
provide
that
kind
of
equal
treatment.
what
title
vii
indicates
is
that
employees
shall
not
be
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
their
religion.
and
if,
in
fact,
there
is
some
evidence
of
discrimination,
then
that
triggers
the
duty
to
accommodate.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right,
absent
a
showing
of
discriminatory
intent
or
motive.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
well,
that's
not
what
the
leave
provisions
say,
though.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
i
would
agree
that
there
would
be
some
point
where,
on
the
face
of
the
bargaining
agreement,
so
much
accommodation
has
been
made
to
secular
needs,
and
so
little
accommodation
made
to
religious
needs,
that
on
the
face
of
the
provisions,
the
leave
provisions
are
discriminatory.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
case
like
that.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
your
honor,
i'll
confess
i
have
no
idea
where
these
leave
provisions
came
from.
there's
no
bargaining
history
to
indicate
why
the
parties
through
the
years
structured
this
kind
of
a
leave
provision.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
your
honor,
i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that's
important
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
the
leave
provisions
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
and
of
course
that
limit
is
no
different
from
the
limit
imposed
on
the
other
reasons
for
which
leave
is
provided.
i
would
also
say
this,
and
the
record
indicates,
that
for
teachers
such
as
philbrook,
who
needs
the
three
days
leave
with
pay
every
year,
those
are
guaranteed
to
occur
in
terms
of
the
cost
impact
on
the
employer.
the
other
leaves
may
or
may
not
occur.
certainly
the
necessary
personal
business
leave
may
never
occur
for
any
teacher,
hypothetically
speaking.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
no
leave
for
any
purpose
or
for
any
reason?
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
i
would
say
that
in
that
case
there
would
still
be
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
attempt
to
accommodate
the
employee's
religious
beliefs.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
the
evidence
indicates,
your
honor,
that
for
the
last
year,
the
most
recent
year
for
which
we
have
any
information,
in
1983-84,
which
is
the
year
that
impacted
the
time
of
trial,
two
teachers,
out
of
a
total
of
150,
had
used
all
of
their
necessary
personal
business
leave
days.
so
the
record
indicates
that
these
days
are
not
frequently
used.
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
no
paid
leave
for
any
reason,
but
paid
leave
only
for
religion?
well,
i
feel
that--
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
--that
would
be
an
accommodation,
certainly,
and
i
think
the
private
employer
could
do
that.
i
think--
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
--if
title
vii
is
interpreted
to
require
that
kind
of
result--
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
--it
could
constitute
a
preference
for
religion.
if
a
school
board
did
that--
mr.
thomas
n.
sullivan
--i
don't
think
a
school
board
could
do
that,
your
honor.
