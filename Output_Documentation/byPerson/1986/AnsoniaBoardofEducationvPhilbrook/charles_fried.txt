mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
appears
here
in
a
dual
role.
we
are
the
principal
enforcer
of
title
vii,
and
we
are
also
the
nation's
largest
employer
subject
to
the
strictures
of
title
vii.
so
it's
important
for
us
to
get
it
right,
and
to
situate
title
vii
within
the
constitutional
landscape
of
the
two
religion
clauses.
the
free
exercise
clause
sets
the
floor
on
the
matter.
it's
addressed
to
prohibitions,
prohibitions
on
belief
and
exercise,
and
by
extension,
to
discriminatory
treatment...
discriminatory
treatment
of
religion
and
religious
exercise.
after
that,
we
believe
there
is
wide
room
for
accommodation
by
government,
as
for
instance,
5
u.s.c.
550a,
which
deals
with
religious
observance
by
federal
employees.
and
also
there's
wide
room
for
government
to
mandate
accommodation
by
private
parties
before
there
is
a
bumping
up
against
the
ceiling
of
the
establishment
clause.
the
establishment
clause
involves
entanglement,
preference
and
the
imposing
of
religion
on
the
citizen
by
support.
but
as
justice
marshall
said
in
the
hardison
case,
accommodation
is
not
establishment,
even
though
the
accommodation
is
not
required
by
the
free
exercise
clause.
title
vii,
in
our
view,
operates
largely
in
that
space
between
the
floor
and
the
ceiling.
it
repeats
the
floor
obligation,
government
may
not
prohibit,
government
may
not
discriminate,
in
its
treatment
of
religion.
but
it
extends
it.
it
extends
it
to
private
employers;
that
already
goes
beyond
the
free
exercise
clause.
and
it
extends
it
in
another
very
important
way,
which
may
be
implicated
in
this
case,
that
is,
where
there
is
a
disparate
impact...
not
disparate
treatment
but
a
disparate
impact...
on
religious
observance,
there
is
a
duty
to
accommodate.
now,
we
stay
clear
of
the
ceiling
set
by
the
thorton
case,
because
that
duty
is
only
a
duty
to
accommodate
reasonably,
and
it's
limited
in
any
event
by
undue
hardship.
in
this
case,
we
have
possibly
a
case
of
straightforward
discriminatory
treatment
because,
and
i
think
we
need
a
remand
to
the
district
court,
and
we
support
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
reason,
we
need
to
know
about
this
personal
business
leave,
because
if
these
personal
days
are
in
fact
an
almost
wide
open,
take
the
time
off
if
you
like,
or
at
least
one
day
of
it
is,
we
consider,
as
does
mr.
rosen,
that
it
would
be
offensive,
that
it
would
be
discriminatory
treatment
for
an
employer
to
say,
take
the
day
off,
do
whatever
you
want,
just
don't
pray;
just
don't
go
to
church.
do
anything
else.
just
don't
go
to
church.
that
is
discriminatory
treatment,
and
would,
for
that
reason
alone,
violate
title
vii.
mr.
charles
fried
that
would
be
another,
more
difficult
case.
but
we
do
have...
we
do
have
the
specific
language
which
says
you
got
three
days
for
mandated
religious
observance.
and
then
they
go
into
a
good
bit
of
detail.
and
then
it's
excluded,
however,
for
any
religious
activity.
so
the
exclusion
is
much
wider.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
that
they
do
talk,
at
least
in
some
versions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
all
versions
are
relevant,
because
we've
got
a
back
pay
claim
here,
too,
in
some
versions
they
spell
out
what
they
mean
by
mandated
religious
observance,
and
it
talks
about
days
required
by
the
rules
of
the
church.
religious
activity
is
not
spelled
out
in
that
way,
and
might
involve
other
activities
other
than
the
observance
of
a
particular
holy
day--
in
any
event--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
no
doubt.
no
doubt.
and
that
is
why
we
support
a
remand.
since
there's
an
alternative
reading
of
that
provision,
which
would
be
quite
unexceptionable
in
terms
of
discriminatory
treatment.
it
may
be
that
those
three
days
are
intended
for
quite
narrow
and
nonrecurring
events,
things
that
don't
come
around
every
year,
regular
as
clockwork,
or
regular
as
the
calendar,
and
also
which
are
not...
which
are
compelled
by
external
compulsion.
in
that
event,
if
that
is
what
we
find
on
remand,
then
in
our
view
there
is
no
discriminatory
treatment.
there
may
however
be
discriminatory
impact.
that
is
to
say,
as
philbrook
has
been
claiming,
that
because
of
his
particular
religious
needs,
this
provision
bears
on
him
in
a
more
burdensome
way
than
on
other
persons;
those
without
those
religious
needs,
or
those
with
only
three
required
religious
holidays.
now,
as
to
discriminatory
impact,
it
is
our
view
that
it
is
only
there
that
the
duty
of
reasonable
accommodation
comes
in,
and
as
to
that
duty,
that
is
where
we
part
company
with
the
court
of
appeals,
and
in
fact,
join
company
with
all
the
other
courts
of
appeals
which
have
considered
this
matter.
and
in
our
view,
once
we're
talking
about
reasonable
accommodation,
the
only
obligation
that
the
employer
has
is
to
offer
a
reasonable
accommodation.
if
it
has
done
that,
he
has
satisfied
his
literal
obligation
under
the
statute.
nothing
else
is
required.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
a
general
way
what
we're
talking
about
a
few
days
a
year,
offering
unpaid
leave
is
a
reasonable
accommodation.
it
may
not
be
the
reasonable
accommodation
which
an
employee
prefers.
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
reasonable
accommodation,
and
discharges
the
obligation
under
the
law.
i'm
quick
to
say
that
if
you
have
an
employee
for
whom
the
problem
arises
not
three
times
a
year,
but
once
a
week,
to
say,
well
once
a
week
you
can
take
off
without
pay,
that
might
become
another
matter.
because
at
that
point
you
are
talking
about
an
imposition
on
employment
status.
you
are
saying
that
this
man
has
got
to
be
paid
80
percent
of
his
salary,
rather
than
just
missing
a
few
days'
pay.
and
at
that
point,
it
may
be
that
leave
without
pay
is
not
a
reasonable
accommodation.
but
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
is
our
view
that
leave
without
pay
is
a
reasonable
accommodation,
and
discharges
the
employer's
obligation.
mr.
charles
fried
when
an
employer
can
show
that
every
reasonable
accommodation
nevertheless
entails
an
undue
burden,
then
this
court
has
held
in
the
hardison
case,
that's
too
bad,
we
regret
it,
but
that's
the
end
of
the
story.
and
the
employee
is
not
accommodated.
but
this
is
all
in
disparate
impact
rather
than
in
disparate
treatment
cases.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
