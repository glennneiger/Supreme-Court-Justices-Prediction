mr.
robert
f.
mcweeny
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
pleases
the
court:
i
represent
the
union,
party
to
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
i
speak
in
support
of
the
school
board
and
the
petition.
i'd
like
to
address
some
of
the
factual
concerns
about
the
leave
policy.
in
addition
to
the
record
showing
that
only
two
of
the
150
teachers
use
three
days,
plaintiff's
exhibit
18
shows
that
most
teachers
took
no
personal...
necessary
personal
business
days
during
the
year.
and
i
think
also
we
have
the
superintendant
of
schools'
testimony
about
the
professional
nature
of
the
employees,
and
that
they
abide
by
those
restrictions
that
it
be
necessary
business,
and
also
that
it
be
business
that
cannot...
despite
all
reasonable
efforts...
be
planned
and
conducted
outside
of
a
time
which
conflicts
with
a
180-day
work
year
for
employees.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
18
days
of
leave...
i
think
the
record
shows
in
connecticut
by
state
statute
15
days
has
to
be
afforded
teachers
for
sick
leave,
so
that's
the
major
portion
of
that
18
days...
i'd
also
point
out
that
one
of
the
uses
of
the
18
days
of
annual
leave
is
for
immediate
family
religious
ceremony.
so
there
is,
i
think,
no
bias
toward
religious
practices.
in
addition
to
the
three
days
of
religious
observances,
religious
ceremony,
immediate
family
religious
ceremony--
mr.
robert
f.
mcweeny
--well,
i
would
just
offer
that
to...
the
religious
ceremony
would
be
similar
to
the
other
types
of
activity.
and
i
think
it
shows
that
the
leave
policy
does
not
discriminate
against
religion
in
the
overall
leave
policy,
as
well
as
affording
a
specific
leave
for
religious
practice,
or
religious
observance.
mr.
robert
f.
mcweeny
that's
correct;
you
could
not.
and
i
would
also
submit
that
the--
mr.
robert
f.
mcweeny
--well,
you
could
not
claim
it
was
a
sick
day.
sick
days,
or
for
leave...
the
general
leave
provision,
that
annual
leave
provision,
sets
for
specific
reasons
for
which
it
can
be
availed.
it
is
not
vacation.
it
is
sick
days.
it
is
other
specific
types
of
personal
necessities.
mr.
robert
f.
mcweeny
that's
correct,
religious
practice.
mr.
robert
f.
mcweeny
that's
true.
that
could
have,
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
mr.
philbrook
or
anyone
else
asked
for,
was
denied,
a
personal
leave
day
for
counselling
with
a
religious
official,
or
a
request
of
that
nature.
i'd
like
to
also
address
the
statutory
construction
issue,
which
i
think
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
the
second
circuit
stated
that
the
interpretation
of
title
vii
with
respect
to
reasonable
accommodation
and
undue
hardship
was
crucial
to
the
resolution
of
the
case.
i
agree.
i
submit
that
they
erred
on
that
construction.
i
think
the
language
clearly
indicates
that
reasonable
accommodation
is
the
obligation
of
the
employer
and
the
union;
and
that
once
that
is
met,
there's
no
reason
to
go
beyond
that
determination
that
there's
been
a
reasonable
accommodation
of
the
employee's
religious
practices.
undue
hardship
really,
in
effect,
creates
a
defense
to
a
failure
to
reasonable
accommodate.
and
in
terms
of
allowing
a
person
to
resolve
that
conflict
between
their
religious
practices
and
their
employment
obligations
in
a
manner
which
allows
them
to
continue
the
employment.
i
think
that
the
cases
the
second
circuit
talks
about,
or
those
termination
cases,
where
clearly
there
was
no
reasonable
accommodation
or
there's
a
reason
to
inquire
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
accommodation,
or
whether
something
could
have
been
to
allow
a
reasonable
accommodation,
in
the
sense
of
allowing
an
employee
to
continue
in
his
employment
and
observe
his
religious
obligations.
i'd
also
like
to
speak
to
a
claim
that
mr.
philbrook
makes
that
he
is
really
in
a
situation
of
substantial
pay,
no
work.
i
submit
that
the
only
evidence
referred
to
by
mr.
philbrook
is
three
pages
of
the
transcript
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
which
merely
state
that
there
was
education
going
on
because
he
had
a
plan
for
the
students
to
follow
during
the
course
of
the
year.
and
that
in
that...
in
those
three
pages
of
transcript,
evidence
designed
to
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
problem
with
the
educational
experience
caused
by
the
use
of
substitute
teachers.
and
i
think
there's
nothing
in
there
that
talks
about
the
amount
of
time
that
would
be
spent,
or
that
in
effect
there
is
no
work
without
pay.
i
would
think
that
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
leave
the
few
minutes
that
are
remaining
to
me
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
f.
mcweeny
i
would
just
like
to
emphasize
that
the
necessary
personal
business
leave
i
think
is
well
documented
in
the
record
as
to
the
limited
use
of
it
by
the
professional
staff
in
ansonia.
also,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
there
has
ever
been
a
denial
of
necessary
personal
leave...
necessary
personal
business
leave
for
anything
other
than
religious
observance.
if
there's
nothing
that...
these
hypothetical
claims
about
work
in
the
soup
kitchen
have
not
been
presented.
and
i
think
the
evidence
is
that
the
policy
is
being
interpreted
and
applied
in
a
way
that
would
not
lead
to
that
result.
and
i
think
that's
clear
both
on
the...
it
is
not
a
general
leave
provision.
it
is
personal
business
leave
that
cannot
be
scheduled
at
any
other
time.
and
there
is
just
no
record
of
any
evidence
of
a
denial
for
any
purpose
other
than
for
what
leave
is
provided
for,
religious
observance.
and
mr.
philbrook
is
being
allowed
all
the
days
that
he
finds
necessary
to
observe
his
religion,
some
with
pay,
and
some
without
pay.
and
i
submit
that
perhaps
there
are
lines,
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated,
that
have
to
be
drawn
in
some
of
these
situations.
