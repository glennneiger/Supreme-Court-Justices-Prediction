education
against
ronald
philbrook.
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready,
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
they
say,
unless
there
was
undue
hardship,
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sullivan,
your
time
has
expired.
we'll
hear
now
from
mr.
mcweeny.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
differences
between
those
two,
mr.
mcweeny?
the
immediate
family
religious
ceremony,
and
the
religious
activity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
i
understand
it,
you
couldn't
use
any
of...
if
you've
used
the
three
days
you
want
for
religious
observances,
under
the
contract,
you
could
not
then
use
some
of
the
18
days
for
other
religious
observances
like
the
ones
the
three
days
are
devoted
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
rosen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
as
clear
as
you
suggest
that
this
personal
religious
thing
that
is
embraced
within
the
18
days
might
not
be
extended
to
the
soup
kitchen
example,
if
mr.
philbrook
felt
a
religious
desire
to
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
client
would
be
no
better
off?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
rosen.
we'll
hear
next
from
you,
general
fried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
mr.
mcweeny,
you
have
three
minutes
left...
you
have
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcweeny.
the
case
is
submitted.
