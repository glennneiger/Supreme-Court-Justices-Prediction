mr.
david
n.
rosen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ansonia
has
drawn
an
explicitly
religious
line
through
its
personal
leave
rule,
disfavoring
religious
exercise,
prohibiting
religious
exercise.
this
explicitly
religious
line
is
presumptively
unlawful,
and
there
were
no
findings
addressing
or
supporting
the
claims
of
lawfulness
of
this
explicitly
religious
line
that
were
made
by
the
district
court.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
your
understanding...
i
have
to
disagree
with
the
understanding
you
were
given
a
couple
of
minutes
ago.
the
contracts,
all
of
the
contracts,
say
that
personal
leave
may
not
be
used
not
only
for
mandatory
religious
observance,
which
is
specifically
provided
for
in
the
religious
leave,
but
also
may
not
be
used
for
quote
any
religious
observance
unquote.
those
are
the
more
recent
contracts.
the
earlier
contracts
used
similar
language,
saying
that
personal
leave
cannot
be
used
for,
quote,
any
religious
activity.
so
what
i
would
call
the
claim
of
neutrality
between
religious
and
secular
uses,
that
is,
that
a
neutral
reason
has
been
chosen
for
excluding
religion
from
the
ambit
of
personal
leave,
is
in
fact
nonexistent.
in
this
contract,
these
contracts,
because
the
provisions
aren't
parallel--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--yes,
that's
right.
except
that
my
statutory
interpretation
does
have
going
for
it
the
statutory
language.
for
example,
on
page
92
of
the
joint
appendix,
personal
business
shall
not
include,
without
limitation,
colon,
f,
any
religious
activity.
so--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--the
representation...
i
should
say
the
representation
was
made
by
the
union,
not
the
board.
i
don't
know
what
the
board's
position
is.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
that
understanding
has
been
communicated
for
the
first
time
here
today.
and
i
think
that
if
we
take
that
to
be
the
understanding,
an
unfairness
remains,
which
is...
can
be
seen
by
taking
the
example
of
mr.
philbrook
and
a
colleague,
each
of
whom
uses
the
three
days
for
religious
holidays
to
satisfy
religious
needs.
the
hypothetical
colleague
then
uses
the
fourth
day
to
fulfill,
let
us
say,
a
deeply
held
but
nonreligious
ethical
commitment
to
aid
the
poor
by
working
in
a
soup
kitchen.
this
would
be
permissible
use
of
personal
business
leave.
the
teacher
would
simply
note
the
use
of
personal
business
leave.
mr.
philbrook
could
not
work
beside
his
colleague
in
the
soup
kitchen
if
that
work
in
the
soup
kitchen
were
part
of
a
religious
holy
day
obligation
of
his
church,
if
the
soup
kitchen
were
sponsored
by
his
church.
so
the
line
is
an
explicit
religious
line.
there
are
no
findings
in
the
district
court
to
uphold
that
line.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
the...
what
is
embraced
within
the
18
days
is
religious
ceremonies,
which
says...
in
the
contract
after
it,
there's
a
parenthetical
description
saying,
bar
mitzvah,
ordination,
first
vows,
and
the
like.
there
was
in
fact,
and
there
is
in
the
record,
evidence
of
an
arbitration
proceeding
on
behalf
of
mr.
philbrook
in
which
it
was
argued
that
he
would
like
to
apply
that
leave
category
to
his
own
religious
observance,
and
as
a
matter
of
contractual
interpretation,
it
was
held
that
that
applied
only
to
this...
things
like
bar
mitzvahs
and
so
forth.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
yes,
yes.
there
is
a...
that
is--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--it
would
less
favorable.
and
our
claim
is
not
that
mr.
philbrook
is
entitled
to
some
particular
measure
of
favorable
treatment.
it
is
that
in
the
according
of
whatever
treatment
he
is
given,
whatever
accommodation
is
made
for
his
needs,
that
it
be
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
no,
it
would
still
be
discriminatory.
because
although
it--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--well,
let
me
give
an
example
that
i
hope
will
explain
why
that
would
be
unfair.
let's
assume
that
an
employer,
perhaps
a
private
employer,
sets
aside
space
for
its
employees
for
religious
observance;
a
chapel,
if
you
will.
and
the
employer
also
has
a
lounge.
the
employer,
we
suggest,
could
not
put
a
sign
up
in
the
lounge,
"no
reading
the
bible
in
the
lounge.
"
or
to
be
more
exact:
"no
reading
the
bible
in
the
lounge
for
religious
purposes.
"
even
though
space
had
been
set
aside
specifically
an
exclusively
for
religious
reasons.
now,
perhaps
to
take
your
example--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--well,
except
that
my
analogy
is,
i'm
using...
i'm
using
available
space
instead
of
money
paid.
but
as
far...
but
the
thing...
we
make
no
general
claim
to
paid
leave.
we
are
entitled
to
paid
leave
here
only
because
paid
leave
is
accorded
for
personal
business,
which
is,
except
for
the
specifically
religious
exclusion,
something
that
would
cover
the
religious
exercise
for
which
mr.
philbrook
needs
the
leave.
now,
justice
stevens,
to
follow
up,
and
also
justice
scalia,
the
point
you
were
making
about
what
i've
termed
neutrality,
the
claim
of
neutrality,
it's
true
that
the
definition,
the
contract,
if
it
were
changed,
would
be
framed
in
terms
of,
any
leave
otherwise
provided
for
in
the
contract.
but
with
our
hypothetical
employer,
let's
assume
that
there
was
also
a
periodical
room
made
available
to
the
employees.
the
employer,
we
suggest,
still
could
not
say,
"no
reading
the
bible
for
religious
purposes,
or
reading
periodicals,
or
performing
any
activity
for
which
space
is
otherwise
provided
in
the
lounge.
"
we
think
that
would
still
be
a
line
that
was
drawn
on
an
explicitly
religious
basis
and
we--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--yes,
sir.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
there
is
none.
our
claim
is--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--we
would
not.
we
claim
no
entitlement
to
use
the
days
which
are
set
aside
for
illness
for
religious
observance.
the
difference
we
see,
the
fundamental
difference,
between
illness
and
personal
business
leave
is
like
in
kind
and
character
to
the
kind
of
conduct...
in
my
soup
kitchen
example,
it
could
be
the
identical
conduct...
to
what
is
permitted.
and
the
difference
is
the
difference
only
made
by
drawing
an
explicit
religious
line
by
the
employer
across
that
leave.
now--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--yes.
that
we
think
would
be
invalid.
we
think
that
the
line
that
is
drawn--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--yes,
because
the
claim
is
one
not
of
accommodation
but
of
discrimination.
we
think
that
it
does
not
make
a
difference
if
the
employer
gives
no
days
for
religion,
or
gives
several
days
for
religion.
and
i
recur
to
the
chapel
example.
even
if
the
chapel
is
a
large
and
beautiful
structure,
much
grander,
let
us
say,
than
the
lounge,
what
is
obnoxious
under
title
vii
is
the
drawing
of
explicit
religious
lines
which
disfavor
religion.
that,
at
minimum,
is
presumptively
unlawful,
and--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--yes.
the
anti...
that
is
the
anti-discrimination
right.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
that
would
be
nondiscriminatory.
it
would
be,
in
a
sense,
less
favorable
than
what
is
now
provided.
but
if
there
is
a
nondiscriminatory
provision...
it
could
be
three
days,
it
could
be
six
days,
it
could
be
some
number
of
days
in
between--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--our
client
would
be
no
better...
he
would
be
free
of
the
discrimination,
but
he
would
be
no
better
off.
our
claim
is
not
that
he's
entitled...
it's
not
essentially
that
he's
entitled
to
any
fixed
amount
of
leave.
it
is
that
in
the
provision
of
leave,
he
is
entitled
to
be
free
from
discrimination.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
that
would
probably...
probably
still
be
all
right
under
title
vii.
you
see
our...
my
client
is
put,
as
anyone
else
is,
into
the
collective
bargaining
process.
and
if
what
comes
out
of
that
process
is
three
days,
or
six
days,
of
general
purpose
personal
leave--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--we
think
that
it
depends
how
much
paid
leave
they
give
for
religion.
we
think
there's
room--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--we
think
that
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
constitution
provides
enough
free
play...
and
title
vii
certainly
does
provide
enough
free
play
to
make
that
kind;
three
days
a
year
would
be
all
right.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
no,
no.
no.
we
think
that
just
as
title
vii
would
not
require
this
accommodation,
an
explicitly
religious
accommodation
by
the
employer,
as
a
general
rule,
so
such
an
accommodation
does
not
justify,
cannot
justify
an
explicitly
religious
line
disfavoring
religion
with
regard
to
personal
leave
provisions.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
we
have
not
cross-petitioned.
we
are
here
supporting
a
judgment
which
remanded
this
case
for
further
findings
about
the
scope
of
personal
leave.
in
that
sense,
i
can't
tell
you
that
i
think
that
you
should
know.
i
think
that
what
the
record
will
show--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--we
don't
object
to
the
remand.
we
did
not
cross-petition.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
as
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief,
that
would
be
a
somewhat
different
and
a
more
difficult
case.
because
then
there
would
be
questions
of
comparability
of
treating
specific
secular
reasons
different
from
a
specific
religious
reason.
so
that
might
be--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--i'm
undecided
on
that.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
for
example,
if
on
remand
it
were
demonstrated,
contrary
to
my
expectation,
that
personal--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--all
right.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
that
would
be
all
right.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
that
would
be
all
right.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
even
that
is
probably
all
right.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
i
think
perhaps
no
days
are
all
right.
but
that's
the
question
on
which
i'm
undecided.
and
a
question
which
i
think
is
really
not
presented
on
our
view
of
this
case,
because
whatever
the
employer
may
be
required
to
do
to
accommodate
religion
does
not
defend
an
employer's
subsequent
or
additional
action,
as
here
with
regard
to
the
personal
leave
days,
discriminating
against
religious
exercises.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
my
view
on
that
is
as
with
the
chapel
example
that
i
used,
it
would
still
be
an
explicitly
religious
line.
it
would
be
that
religion
is
not
permitted...
because
it
is
religion
not
because--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--that
is--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--that,
i
suggest,
justice
stevens,
is
presented
as
what
is
claimed
to
be
a
good
reason
to
discriminate
against
religion,
if
you
will.
a
good
reason
being,
well,
that
religion
is
being
limited--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--religion
is--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--all
right.
the
difference,
as
i
see
it,
is
that
it's
legitimate
of
the
state
or
the
employer
to
make
any
limits
it
wants
on
all
these
other
categories
without
running
afoul
of
religious
discrimination
provisions
in
title
vii.
with
regard
to
the
religious
discrimination
provisions,
however,
the
employer
is
limited
even
if...
even
if
it
has
drawn
the
line
which
also
applies
to
the
other
categories,
it
is
still
going
along
saying,
no
religion
allowed.
this
creates
the
same
problems
of
excluding
religion
because
it
is
religious;
excluding
activities
which
are
identical
because
of
their
motivation;
excluding
mr.
philbrook
from
using
a
religious
holy
day
to
observe
or
commemorate
the
death
of
a
loved
one,
although
his
co-employee
could
take
such
a
similar
commemoration
by
going
to
a
gravesite,
so
long
as
the
form
of
commemoration
was
a
nonreligious
one.
so
it
still
draws
a
line--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--the
line
i
suggest
would
not
be
particularity,
but
comparability,
justice
scalia;
that
if
commemoration
of
the
death
of
loved
ones
is
permissible,
and
that
commemoration
takes
the
form
of
observance
of
a
religious
holy
day,
i
would
say
that
exclusion
of
the
religious
holy
day
is
discriminatory.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
in
sum,
our
view
is
that
the
line
here
is--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--yes,
justice
white.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
we
think
that
the
right
line
is
all
weddings...
if
weddings
are
allowed,
then
you
can't
discriminate
between
secular
weddings
and
religious
weddings.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
i
think
it's
all
right
for
an
employer
to
identify
a
specific
purpose
like
a
wedding.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
thank
you.
