justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
so
during
the
entire
period
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
between,
what
was
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--'67
and
'69,
they
could
use
those
three
days,
as
far
as
we
know,
for
anything
they
wanted?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
nonetheless,
philbrook
was
not
allowed
to
use
it
for
religious
reasons.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
just
saying
that
this...
as
to
this
one
day,
it's
not
practically
enforceable,
and
it's
left
up
to
the
conscience
and
responsibility
of
the
teacher.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
purpose
of
the
provision,
that
one
day
provision?
that
it
may
be
something
so
confidential
that
the
teacher
wouldn't
want
to
spread
it
on
the
record,
or
something
of
that
sort?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
what
the
eeoc
regulations
seem
to
require?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
because
this
ties
in
with
what
justice
o'connor
just
asked.
you
answered
the
way
you
did,
i
presume,
because
the
employer
in
that
hypothetical
is
being...
is
treating
both
religious
and
nonreligious
leave
equivalently?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
he
doing
the
same
here?
how
do
we
know
that
three
days
of
leave
for
days
of
rest,
religiously
required,
how
do
we
know
that
that's
enough,
that
that's
equivalent
to
18
days
for
nonreligious
reasons?
how
do
we
know
that
that's
an
equivalent
treatment
of
religion?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
isn't
that
they
don't
provide
him
all
that
he
needs.
the
issue
is
whether,
without
the
use
of
those
three
other
days,
the
employer
is
treating
religious
leave
and
leave
for
other
than
religious
purposes
equally.
and
i
look
at
it.
and
gee,
there
are
only
three
days
for
religion,
and
there
are
18
days
for
other
than
religion.
so
we
really
don't
have
the
kind
of
hypothetical
that
justice
o'connor
gave
you,
where
you
get
no
leave
for
any
reason;
no
paid
leave
for
either
religion
or
nonreligion.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
give...
suppose
it
said
18
days
for
any
reason
except
religious;
that's
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
discriminatory?
i
don't
understand.
isn't
that
discriminatory
on
its
face?
any
reason
will
suffice
except
a
religious
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that.
suppose
he
just
gave
them,
you
know,
18
days
for
other
than
religious
reasons;
two
hours
for
religious
reasons.
at
what
point
does
it
become
nondiscriminatory?
how
do
you
know
that
three
days
is
enough
to
make
it
nondiscriminatory?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
not.
i
just
don't
know
what
the
test
is.
is
the
test,
perhaps,
that
there
was
some
estimate
by
those
who
bargained
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
to
how
much
time
off
the
average
employee
needs
for
all
these
other
purposes.
and
when
they
figured
it
all
out,
the
average
employees
needs
18
days
for
nonreligious,
and
three
days
for
religious?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
i
understood
you
could
not
use
any
of
the
three
days
for
that,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
three
religious
days
off
are
day-of-rest
provisions,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
days
when
you
religion
doesn't
allow
you
to
work.
and
as
i
understand
the
scheme,
if
you
wanted
off
for
another
religious
reason,
not
because
it's
a
day
of
rest,
because
you
want
to
make
a
religious
retreat
or
something
like
that,
as
far
as
we
know,
after
1969,
at
least,
that
could
have
been...
that
could
have
come
within
the
three
day
"other"
provision,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
an
explicitly
religious
line?
as
i
understand
their
scheme,
you
can
use
these
three
days
for
anything,
religious
or
nonreligious,
so
long
as
it's
not
one
of
the
things
for
which
days
are
specifically
provided
for.
now,
there
are
some
things
for
which
days
have
been
specifically
provided
for
that
are
secular,
and
there
are
other
things
that
are
religious,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
just
have
a
dispute
as
to
the
contractual
interpretation,
then.
never
mind
the
statutory
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
board
is
telling
us
that
it
interprets
the
contract
the
other
way,
why
do
we
have
to
get
in
a
fight
over
what
the
contract
means?
can't
we
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
board
will
apply
the
contract
the
way
it
represents
it
now
interprets
it?
i
mean,
i
didn't
realize
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
contracts
case.
i
thought
it
was
title
vii.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
think
the
board's
position
is
the
same,
as
i
understand
it.
that
those
three
days
can
be
used
for
anything
not
specifically
covered
by
other
days
off,
religious
or
nonreligious.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
clear
about
your
position.
suppose
there
were
18
days
for
a
listed
number
of
nonreligious
reasons.
no
days
of
paid
leave
for
any
religious
reason
whatever.
that
would
be
all
right
in
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
undecided
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
if
the
18
days
were...
in
this
case
were
expanded
to
21
days;
21
days
for
explicit
secular
reasons,
and
3
days
for
religious
observance;
that
would
be
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it's
a
new
contract.
it's
a
new
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
three-day
wildcard
is
gone.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
get
21
days
for
explicit
nonreligious
reasons,
and
three
days
for
religious
reasons.
that's
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
one
day
for
religious
reasons?
justice
antonin
scalia
half
a
day?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
acceptable
to
you
so
long...
or
you
think
it
may
be
acceptable
to
you,
so
long
as
they
list
all
of
the
conceivable
nonreligious
purposes,
and
fail
to
list
any
religious
purposes?
that's
all
right.
the
only
thing
that
sticks
in
your
craw
is
if
they
say,
provided
no
religious
observance.
as
long
as
they
just
list
nothing
but
secular
observances,
that's
okay,
or
may
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
said...
what
if
it
meant,
do
anything
you
want.
just
don't
use
it
as
a
day
of
observance
for
which
we've
given
you
three
days
under
another
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't.
because
the
category
from
which
you're
excluding
is
necessary
personal
business.
when
you
exclude
religious
observance
as
a
subcategory
of
necessary
personal
business,
you're
excluding
necessary
religious
observance.
which
seems
to
me
to
be
the
same
thing
as
mandated
religious
observance.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
might
that
be
another
issue
that
it
would
be
well
to
have
clarified,
if
there
is
a
remand?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
also
be
that
there's
no
possible
accommodation
without
an
undue
burden.
i
mean,
if
you're
suggesting
leave
with
pay,
52
days
a
year--
