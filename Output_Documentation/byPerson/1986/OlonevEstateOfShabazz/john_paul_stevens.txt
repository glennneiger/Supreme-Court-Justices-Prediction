justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
at
that
point:
do
you
think
all
free
exercise
claims
should
be
analyzed
in
precisely
the
same
way?
let's
say
this
was
a
question
of
diet
rather
than
a
question
of
attending
an
important
religious
service.
would
the
issue
be
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
specifically
say
that
here
you
have
a
religious
ceremony
that
is
claimed
to
be
an
important
part
of
the
religion
of
the
inmate.
does
that
require
greater
attention
or
a
greater
degree
of
reasonableness
in
saying,
"you
can't
go
to
your
service.
"
than
it
would
to
just
say,
"you
have
to
eat
the
standard
diet
that
everyone
else
eats?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
parameters
are
that
the
work
schedule
is
everybody
has
to
work
outside
the
main
facility
from
9:00
to
5:00
every
day,
and
that
we
can
show
that
it's
much
easier
to
control
the
population
if
we
do
it
that
way.
and
one
of
the
unfortunate
by-products
is
that
no
one
can
attend
religious
services.
but
they
could
demonstrate
that
it's
a
much
more
efficient
and
safe
way
to
run
the
prison.
would
that
be...
that
would
be
all
they
would
have
to
do,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
cheaper;
they
need
less
guards;
and
they
can
keep
count
of
people
much
easier.
there's
a
lot
of
good
reasons
why
i
think
it
would
make
sense
to
have
everybody
follow
precisely
the
same
routine
throughout
the
institution.
but
that,
i
take
it,
would
be
perfectly
permissible,
even
if
these
people
couldn't
go
to
their
services
and
people
of
other
faiths
couldn't
go
to
saturday
or
sunday
services.
that
would
still
be
okay,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
these
things
probably
boil
down
to
how
many
guards
you
need
on
duty
at
particular
times
and
places.
and
if
you
can
always
show
that
"we'll
save
three
guards
a
week.
"
there's
a
personnel
cost,
would
that
always
be
sufficient...
or
five
guards,
whatever
you
might
say.
shouldn't
that
be...
if
you
can
just
prove
that,
that
by
having
a
standardized
practice,
you
will
always
save
x
dollars
in
salary
costs
and
make
the
place
a
little
bit
safer,
that
would
be
the
answer
in
every
case,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
ten
guards.
say
you
could
definitely
save
ten
guards
every
day
by
doing
it,
would
that
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it's
always
a
matter
of
economics,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
the
warden
have
to
show
that
the
security
concerns
are
genuine,
or
does
he
just
have
to
assert
them,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
they're
genuine.
but
he
didn't
under
the
claire
standard,
as
i
understand,
at
least
as
judge
adams
described
it,
he
didn't
have
to
do
that
under
the
claire
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
judge
adams
said
that
under
st.
claire,
the
state
was
under
no
burden
to
establish
that
such
security
concerns
were
genuine
and
were
based
on
more
than
speculation.
do
you
agree
that
that's
a
correct
characterization
of
the
standard
you're
asking
us
to
adopt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whenever
he
is
arguably
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
means
he
can
make
a
good
argument
for
his
position,
whether
the
facts
support
it
or
not,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess:
i
have
some
difficulty
knowing
exactly
what
we're
supposed
to
decide
in
this
case.
i
mean,
the
difference
between
the
st.
claire
standard
and
what
was
opened
to
you
on
remand
in
this
case
and
what
you're
saying,
it
seems
to
me
you're
asking
us
to
do
something
in
between...
at
least
in
between
what
judge
adams
describes
as
the
st.
claire
standard,
as
in
the
standard
he
specified
for
the
remand.
i
think
you
want
something
in
between.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
if
the
facts
as
you
describe
them
are
correct...
and
i'm
sure
that
they
are...
that
you
would
prevail
on
remand
under
judge
adams'
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you
would,
given
what
you've
just
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask:
if
you
agree
that
the
response
is
exaggerated,
it
can't
be...
i'm
not
sure
the
difference
between
the
least
restrictive
response
and
the
most
exaggerated...
i'm
having
trouble
stating
it.
but
wouldn't
you
agree
that
when
the
prisoner
shows
that
it's
exaggerated,
what
he's
showing
is
it's
more
restrictive
than
necessary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
does
it
mean
to
say
it's
an
exaggerated
response?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
those
are
not
free
exercise
cases.
those
are
not
free
exercise
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
have
this
exaggerated
problem
in
those
other
areas,
do
you,
the
problem
of
saying
that
the
response
was
exaggerated
because
you
basically
just
asked
whether
the
regulation
is
reasonable.
that's
all
you
do
in
those
areas.
