ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
here
is
the
standard
of
review
of
a
prison
regulation
which
affects
the
ability
of
some
prisoners
to
participate
in
a
religious
practice.
the
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
regulation
at
issue
required
prison
inmates
who
are
assigned
to
work
outside
during
the
day
to
remain
outside.
it
prohibited
returns
to
the
institution
for
any
reason,
save
for
medical
emergencies.
the
district
court
upheld
the
regulation
against
respondent's
first
amendment
challenge,
finding
that
it
was
reasonably
related
to
legitimate
goals
of
security
and
rehabilitation,
and
that
it
was
not
an
exaggerated
response
to
those
objectives.
a
panel
from
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
under
its
st.
claire
versus
cuyler
standard,
a
reasonable
relationship
tests.
a
rehearing
en
banc
was
then
granted,
and
the
court
of
appeals
modified
its
earlier
test,
holding
that
prison
officials
must
prove
their
regulations
are
intended
to
serve
and
do
serve
security
goals.
and,
further,
they
must
prove
that
there
is
no
reasonable
method
in
existence
to
accommodate
the
inmates'
religious
practices
without
creating
bona
fide
security
problems.
petitioners
submit
that
the
proper
analysis
to
be
applied
here
is
the
analysis
that
was
applied
by
this
court
in
jones,
pell
versus
procunier
and
bell
versus
wolfish;
that
is,
a
regulation
must
be
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
objective.
absent
evidence
that
the
response
is
an
exaggerated
one,
the
regulation
will
be
upheld.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
of
course,
only
a
free
exercise
claim
was
raised
here.
it's
unclear
whether
it
would
apply
to
other
first
amendment
claims.
this
court
has
recognized
the
importance
of
deferring
to
the
considered
judgments
that
prison
officials
have
to
make
on
a
daily
basis
in
regards
to
questions
of
security.
prisons,
of
course,
differ
greatly
from
the
outside
world.
there
really
is
no
counterpart
to
a
prison
in
the
outside
world.
they
are
closed,
sub-societies,
populated
by
people
who
have
committed
crimes
against
society
and
often
these
are
very
violent
crimes.
of
course,
they
are
involuntarily
confined;
and
that,
in
and
of
itself,
lends
itself
to
great
confrontation
and
tension
between
the
inmates
and
staff.
in
this
hostile,
adversarial
atmosphere
prison
officials
are
charged
with
maintaining
security,
maintaining
an
orderly
operation;
and
to
the
extent
possible
prison
officials
have
the
obligation
to
attempt
to
rehabilitate
inmates.
however,
inmates
are
constantly
making
challenges
to
prison
authority.
the
tensions
between
inmates
and
staff
make
for
a
very
volatile
atmosphere,
and
this
atmosphere
changes
at
all
times.
sometimes
an
institution
is
running
very
smoothly,
and
the
superintendent
may
be
able
to
make
further
privileges
available
to
inmates.
other
times
the
superintendent
will
get
a
sense
that
there
is
a
great
amount
of
tension
underlying
the
prison
administration.
the
court
has
said
that
prisoners'
claims
must
be
decided
against
this
background.
they
must
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
the
needs
and
the
problems
that
confront
prison
administrators.
in
jones,
therefore,
this
court
held
that
the
burden
is
not
on
prison
officials
to
show
affirmatively
that
the
regulated
activity
would
be
detrimental
to
proper
institutional
goals.
deference
is
to
be
extended
to
their
opinions
unless
there
is
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
to
show
that
their
response
is
exaggerated.
this
same
analysis
has
been
applied...
had
been
previously
applied
in
pell
versus
procunier,
and
was
subsequently
applied
in
bell
versus
wolfish.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying--
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
--that
the
activity
would
definitely
jeopardize...
the
regulated
activity
would
definitely
jeopardize
the
security
of
the
institution.
they
must,
of
course,
show
that
their
regulation
was
adopted
in
order
to
meet
the
security
problems.
they
must
show
that
it's
reasonably
related.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
we
submit
that
this
same
analysis
that
was
applied
by
this
court
in
the
controlling
cases
should
apply
to
free
exercise
claims
as
well.
the
cases
that
i
mentioned
were
all
brought
pursuant
to
the
first
amendment,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
there
should
be
any
differentiation
in
terms
of
a
ranking
of
constitutional
rights,
and
that
the
same
analysis
should
apply
to
free
exercise
claims.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
the
standard
should
still
be
a
reasonable
relationship
test
to
legitimate
penalogical
objectives.
of
course,
within
that
test
there
is
room
for
taking
into
account
the
various
needs
of
the
prison
officials,
the
various
requests
of
the
plaintiffs...
of
the
prisoners.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
your
honor,
there
may
be
some
differences
permitted
within
the
reasonable
relationship
test,
but
it
is
very
difficult
for
prison
administrators
to
evaluate
the
claims
of
prisoners,
in
terms
of
how
important
it
is
to
their
religious
beliefs.
it
puts
the
prison
officials
in
a
very
difficult
position
of
saying,
"well,
we
think
your
religion...
your
religious
practice
is
central
and
vital
to
your
religious
beliefs,
whereas
yours
is
not
quite
as
important.
"
that
lends
itself
to
additional
confrontations
to
inmates,
which
the
prison
officials
here
testified
they
wanted
to
avoid.
they
would
prefer
to
set
their
standards
and
then
allow
the
prisoners
to
practice
their
religious
beliefs
to
the
extent
that
they
can
within
those
parameters.
we
submit
that--
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
--well,
as
long
as
it
is
not
considered
an
exaggerated
response
and
the
prisoners
do
have
the
opportunity--
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
--if
the
showing
the
prison
officials
have
made...
and
if
the
court
is
able
to
determine
that
those
security
measures
are
reasonably
related
to...
if
the
measures
are
reasonably
related
to
security,
then
it
probably
would
pass
constitutional
muster.
of
course,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
in
his
brief,
there
are
situations
where
a
regulation
seems...
or
appears
to
be
related
to
security.
and,
indeed,
the
prison
officials
testify
that
it
is,
where
the
court
was
able
to
determine
that
it
was
an
exaggerated
response.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
it
may
not
be
an
answer
in
every
case.
the
circumstances
of
each
case
do
have
to
be
considered.
and
again
if
the
prisoners--
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
--i'm
not
so
sure--
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
--i'm
not
so
sure
it's
always
a
matter
of
economics,
your
honor.
actually
it's
an
additional
problem
than
that.
this
case
is
a
example
of
the
additional
problem.
we
have
a
rule
that
was
clearly
related
to
the
security
problems
that
were
arising
with
this
outside
work
program.
and
in
order
to
accommodate
the
inmates,
exceptions
would
have
had
to
have
been
made
for
these
two
particular
inmates.
that
causes
severe
problems
for
prison
administration,
problems
that
eventually
lead
to
greater
security
problems.
the
other
inmates
see
that
one
or
two
or
a
particular
group
of
inmates
is
getting
a
benefit
or
an
exemption
from
a
rule
that
is
supposed
to
apply
across
the
board,
that
generates
hostility
amongst
those
inmates.
it
also,
in
the
eyes
of
the
inmates,
allows
them
to
perceive
the
ones
who
are
getting
the
benefit
as
more
powerful
inmates.
and
that's
very
dangerous
in
a
prison
society.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
yes.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
no,
your
honor.
and
this
case--
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
prison
officials
do
want
to
accommodate
inmates'
religious
requests,
and
i
think
that's
very
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case.
the
leesburg
officials
went
out
of
their
way
to
accommodate
prisoners'
religious
beliefs
to
the
extent
that
they
could
within
sound
penalogical
policy
and
theory.
and,
in
fact,
the
prison
officials
testified
that
they
want
to
avoid
confrontations
with
inmates.
so
that
if
inmates
make
a
request
to
practice
a
religious
service,
they're
going
to
allow
it
unless
there's
a
very
good
reason
not
to
allow
it.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
your
honor,
the
solicitor
general
did
append
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons'
regulations
regarding
religious
accommodation.
and,
in
fact,
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons,
just
as
the
state
of
new
jersey
prison
system,
attempts
to
accommodate
inmates
to
the
extent
that
they
can.
of
course,
there
is
always
a
qualification
there.
it
must
be
within
the
bounds
of
security.
whether
in
this
precise
situation,
where
great
numbers
of
inmates
are
working
outside
at
a
great
distance
from
the
institution,
and
where
there
are
definite
security
problems
in
allowing
them
to
attend...
to
get
back
to
the
institution
to
attend,
i
can't
actually
answer
whether
the
federal
bureau
would
have
the
same
problem.
but--
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
--i'm
not
so
sure
i
agree.
i
think
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
is
still
concerned
about
security.
and--
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
--exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
no,
it
was
a
policy
that
the
leesburg
officials
instituted
to
meet
the
problems
that
were
facing
them
on
a
regular
basis.
and
various
prisons,
of
course,
are
going
to
have
different
programs.
some
prisons
are
going
to
be
complete
maximum
security
prisons,
and
the
inmates
are
never
going
to
go
beyond
the
walls.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
no,
your--
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
--no,
your
honor.
we're
not
saying
that.
we're
saying
that
the
prison
officials
do
have
to
show
that
their
regulations
have
a
reasonable
basis
in
security,
that
they
are
reasonably
related
to
security
and
that
they
are
not
an
exaggerated
response.
but
we
disagree
that
the
burden
of
proof
should
be
placed
on
prison
officials
to
show
that
there
is
no
other
alternative
to
accommodating
the
competing
concerns
here.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
yes,
your
honor.
there
the
court
adopted
a
three-part
standard.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
well,
we
have
problems
with
that
decision.
the
court
there
said
that
if
the
practice
sought
to
be
engaged
in
is
presumptively
dangerous,
then
there
should
be
more
deference
to
the
prison
officials'
determinations.
and
it's
more
likely
that
the
rule
will
be
upheld.
the
problems
we
have
with
that
are
that
it's
very...
it
puts
courts
and
judges
in
the
position
of
determining
what
type
of
behavior
in
a
particular
prison
under
particular
circumstances
is
presumptively
dangerous.
we
think
that
it
does
not
allow
enough
deference
to
the
judgment
of
the
prison
officials,
the
ones
with
the
expertise
in
these
problems.
it
also
does
not
recognize
other
legitimate
goals
that
this
court
has
recognized,
such
as
rehabilitation.
it
requires
courts
to
weigh
competing
security
concerns.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
to
a
certain
extent,
your
honor,
that
can
be
part
of
the
analysis.
there
is
room
for
that
in
the
reasonable
relationship
standard.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
exactly.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
the
warden
can't
make
conclusionary
statements
about
security.
he
does
have
to
demonstrate
that
they
are
real
concerns.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
i
think
under
st.
claire,
still
the
security
goals...
the
security
objectives
have
to
be
real,
but
they
do
not
have
to
be
very
immediate;
and
they
don't
have
to
show
a
past
problem,
a
past
history
of
security
concerns,
or
that
these
particular
inmates
have
a
proclivity
to
unruly
conduct.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
agree
with
judge
adams'
interpretation
of
st.
claire.
in
the
st.
claire
opinion
the
analysis
there,
the
prison
officials
still
have
to
show
that
their
regulations
are
related
to
security,
and
the
court
still
has
to
make
a
determination
that
those
opinions
of
the
prison
officials
are
sincerely
held,
and
more
than
that,
that
they
are
arguably
correct.
so
there
is
still
a
determination
by
the
court
that
these
regulations,
that
their
opinions
about
the
need
for
the
regulations
are
arguably
correct.
that
means...
of
course,
if
a
judge
disagrees
perhaps...
but
if
there
is
room
for
disagreement,
the
judge
should
defer
to
the
prison
officials.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
yes.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
well,
i
think
the
facts
would
have
to
support
his
opinion.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
well,
your
honor,
the
third
circuit's
new
standard
does
not
permit
the
amount
of
deference
to
opinions
of
prison
officials
that
this
court
says
should
be
granted
to
their
opinions.
we
think
the
st.
claire
standard
of
reasonable
relationship
test,
which
was
based
on
this
court's
decisions
in
jones
and
pell
versus
procunier
is
the
proper
test
to
be
applied.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
yes,
your
honor;
that's
correct.
but
we
believe
that
st.
claire
was
based
very
much
on
jones
and
took
language
directly
from
jones.
the
problem
with
placing
any
more
onerous
burden
on
the
prison
officials
is
that
it
encourages
inmates
to
couch
their
claims
in
first
amendment
terms
and
to
seek
to
fit
within
the
particular
exemptions
that
are
being
granted.
the
findings
of
fact
here,
which
were
based
on
the
testimony
not
only
of
the
officials,
but
also
of
the
prisoners
were
that
many
prisoners
were
claiming
to
be
muslim,
so
that
they
could
avoid
a
day
of
the
outside
work
program.
the
testimony
was
that
the
outside
work
program
was
not
very
easily
accepted
by
the
prisoners,
and
many
of
them
sought
to
come
within
exemptions
to
the
rule.
we
submit
that
prison
officials
should
not
be
in
a
position
of
having
to
challenge
the
inmates'
sincerity
of
their
beliefs,
that
if
an
inmate
comes
forward
and
says,
"well,
i
am
of
this
particular
religion,
and
it
requires
me
to
do
this
particular
act.
"
prison
officials
don't
want
to
challenge
that.
and
there's
really
nothing
more
that
they
can
do,
other
than
making
a
very
minimal
inquiry.
once
a
prisoner
says,
"this
is
indeed
my
religion",
there's
not
much
that
the
prison
officials
can
do.
and
yet,
undoubtedly,
with
a
very
onerous
burden
on
the
state,
one
which
will
be
very
difficult
to
meet,
prisoners
will
be
making
additional
claims.
we
noted
in
our
reply
brief
that
the
fifth
circuit
recently
noted
the
problem
of
proliferation
of
claims
amongst
inmates.
but
the
facts
here
show
that
the
prison
officials
made
a
very
good
faith
attempt
to
accommodate
the
religious
beliefs
of
inmates.
these
regulations
were
not
adopted
in
a
vacuum.
the
program
had
started
in
april
of
'83.
as
problems
arose,
the
prison
officials
attempted
to
meet
those
problems.
what
they
found
and
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
each
time
the
prison
officials
eliminated
an
excuse
for
the
inmates
to
come
in,
they
came
up
with
a
new
excuse.
and
finally,
with
these
increasing
problems,
the
prison
officials,
after
they
discussed
it
with
all
the
professional
staff,
adopted
this
regulation.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
we're
really
not
sure
if
we
would
prevail,
your
honor.
ms.
laurie
m.
hodian
despite
these
findings
of
fact,
judge
adams
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
prison
officials
would
have
to
show
more
than
they
had
already
shown.
