justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
ms.
hodian.
are
you
saying
that
the
prison
officials
don't
have
to
justify
their
regulation
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
just
said,
that
they
don't
have
to
show
affirmatively.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hodian,
new
jersey
still
has
a
legislature,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
likely
to
allow
the
prisons
to
operate
seven
days
a
week
without
any
church
services
for
any
of
the
inmates,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
prison
administrators
generally
like
the
prisoners
to
go
to
church
services,
i
would
think,
unless
your
religion
is
satanism.
it
generally
calms
down,
rather
than
stirs
up
the
prison
populace,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
isn't
a
new
jersey-wide
rule,
is
it?
it's
just
this
one
prison
that's
overcrowded,
and
they
have
their
prisoners
out
in
the
field
in
order
to
have
fewer
there
during
the
day
because
they
just
don't
have
enough
room
for
them
during
the
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
isn't
a
new
jersey-wide
rule.
it's
just
this
the
one
facility.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
have
to
do
that,
wouldn't
you,
if
you
agree
that
the
prison
official
has
to
show
it's
not
an
exaggerated
response?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
the
prison
official
have
to
show
that
there
isn't...
i
mean,
if
there's
something
much
less
drastic
that
could
be
done,
he'd
have
to
show
there
wasn't
such
a
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
since
you're
urging
the
same
test
under
not
just
the
religion
clause
but
all
other
clauses,
that
argument
sort
of
goes
down
the
tubes.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
in
the
religion
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
katz,
you
say
that
religious
services
have
been
allowed
in
prisons
for
200
years.
what
hours
the
religious
service
has
to
be
conducted
has
some
bearing
on
how
easy
it
is
for
the
prison
officials
to
accommodate
it,
isn't
it?
they
were
perfectly
willing
to
allow
a
muslim
service
an
friday,
as
i
understand
it,
but
not
during
the
lunch
hour,
not
in
the
middle
of
the
day.
and
it's
sort
of
a
standoff
between
the
prison
officials
and
the
muslim
faith.
i
understand
that
it's
the
requirement
of
the
faith
that
the
service
be
at
noon,
or
high
noon,
during
the
day.
and
that's
the
only
time
that
the
prison
officials
say
that
they
can't
accommodate
on
friday.
they
were
willing
to
accommodate
it
later
that
day,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
i'm
not
questioning
that.
but
i'm
saying
to
say
that
prison
officials
should
allow
religious
services
is...
is
one
thing,
when
that
means
at
some
point
on
saturday
or
sunday
or
friday
they
have
to
allow
a
religious
service.
but
to
say,
they
have
to
allow
it
at
noon
on
friday,
it
puts
more
demands
on
the
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
but
my
point
is,
the
more
rigid
the
religious
belief
is,
the
more
difficult
it
is
for
the
state
to
accommodate
it
in
the
context
of
a
prison.
that
stands
to
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
one
of
the
objections
the
alternate
work
detail,
some
people
would
prefer
the
alternate
work,
and
the
prisons
had
had
trouble--
justice
antonin
scalia
--wasn't
one
of
the
objections
that
the
institution
found
it
penalogically
unsound
to
have
gangs
or
teams
of
one
group,
whether
they
were
all
fundamentalist
christians
or
all
moslems
or
all
blacks
or
all
whites
or
anything
else?
wasn't
that
a
proper
penalogical
concern?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can't
accept
what
seems
like
a
reasonable
judgment
by
penal
officials
until
they
try
it
and
on
the
specific
detail
there
is
a
riot
or
somebody
killed?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
saying
that
initially.
initially
it's
saying
you
can
satisfy
them
by
staying,
out
of
jail.
i
mean,
we're
not
dealing
with
free
citizens
here.
we're
dealing
with
people
who
have
been
put
in
a
restricted
situation,
through
no
fault
of
the
state's,
and
we're
just
talking
about
what
kind
of
accommodation
has
to
be
made
in
that
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
called
upon
to
decide
those
facts,
are
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
just
called
upon
to
decide
what
test
shall
be
applied
to
those
facts.
now
you
may
or
may
not
be
right
that
the
work
detail
posed
a
problem,
or
that
it
isn't
reasonable
to
think
that
it
would
pose
a
problem.
but
all
we're
really
supposed
to
decide
is,
on
what
test
should
the
court
that
decides
those
facts
decide
them,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
substantial
evidence
is
less
than
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
opponent's
point
is
that
to
the
extent
that
the
benefits
that
have
to
be
given
upon
the
assertion
of
a
religious
claims
are
increased,
the
incentive
to
assert
false
religious
claims
will
be
increased.
if...
if
one
of
the
things
you
get
is
that
you
can
come
back
from
the
fields
on
friday,
or
not
get
sent
to
the
fields
on
friday,
that
will
induce
false
religious
claims.
i
think
that's
true.
your
point
is
quite
right.
you're
going
to
have
false
claims
anyway.
but
the
point
being
made
by
the
other
side
is
that
to
the
extent
you
get
more
and
more
benefits
if
you
adopt
the
least
restrictive
alternative
test,
the
incentive
for
those
claims
will
increase.
now,
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
put
it
that
way
if
you
like,
but
it's
true.
