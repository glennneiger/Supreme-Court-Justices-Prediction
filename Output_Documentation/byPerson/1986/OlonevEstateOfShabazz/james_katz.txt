mr.
james
katz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
for
almost
200
years
religious
services
have
been
conducted
in
prisons
for
inmates.
while
incarceration
necessarily
places
limitations
upon
the
rights
enjoyed
by
free
citizens,
it
is
equally
true
that
inmates
do
not
shed
all
basic
constitutional
rights
by
reason
of
confinement
or
conviction.
rather,
they
retain
those
rights
not
inconsistent
with
their
status
as
prisoners
or
legitimate
penalogical
objectives.
this
court
has
held
that
prisoners
retain
the
right
to
practice
their
religion,
and
has
reaffirmed
that
prisoners
should
be
accorded
all
basic
opportunities
to
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion,
as
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
james
katz
your
honor,
this
service
has
unique
religious
content
to
it.
mr.
james
katz
your
honor,
it
may
put
more
demands
on
the
system,
but
this
religious
service
is,
at
that
time,
is
central
to
the
muslim
faith.
fourteen
hundred
years
of
islamic
scholarship
confirm
that.
the
koran
confirms
that.
and
to
tell
a
muslim,
where
the
service
is
so
central
to
his
or
her
faith,
that
you
can
hold
the
service
at
a
later
time
effectively
eliminates
the
religious
content
of
that
service.
it's
like
saying
that
you
can
hold
christmas
on
the
4th
of
july
or
passover
on
st.
patrick's
day.
mr.
james
katz
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
this
service
was
accommodated
by
the
state.
the
record
shows
that
this
service
was
held
since
1979
at
this
prisons.
the
record
shows
that
prior
to
march
of
1984,
all
muslim
inmates
were
permitted
to
attend
that
service,
both
maximum
security
inmates
as
well
as
minimum
or
gang
minimum
security
inmates.
and
the
record
shows
that
presently
maximum
security
inmates,
those
inmates
who
potentially
are
the
greatest
risk
to
the
institution,
are
allowed
to
attend
that
services.
so
the
question
of
accommodation,
it
seems
to
me,
is
belled
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
petitioners
in
their
argument
focus
on
the
no-return
policy,
and
argue
that
that
policy
was
rationally
related
to
the
institution's
legitimate
security
concerns.
the
problem
with
that
argument
is,
it
misses
the
point
here.
no
one
is
disputing
that
the
no-return
policy
was
rationally
related.
the
problem
here
is
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
institution's
general
prison
policies
are
rational.
we
concede
that
they
are.
the
central
issue
was
the
justification
for
the
deprivation
of
these
inmates'
religious
rights.
that's
what
needs
to
be
focused
on.
the
institution's
policies
may
be
rational,
but
nonetheless
that
fails
to
deal
with
whether,
as
the
third
circuit
held,
it
is
possible
to
both
reasonably
accommodate
the
inmates'
commands
of
conscience
and
the
institution's
legitimate
security
concerns.
petitioners
fail
to
focus
on
this.
the
no-return
policy
was
never
applicable
to
the
gang
minimum
inmates,
because
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
gang
minimum
inmates,
prior
to
march
of
1984,
worked
on
an
alternate
work
detail.
that
work
detail
was
inside
the
institution.
they
never
had
to
go
back
into
the
institution
to
participate
in
the
jumu'ah
service.
moreover,
the
minimum
inmates,
who
are
housed
at
the
farm,
which
is
a
geographically
separate
and
physically
distinct
facility,
were
able
to
go
back
to
the
service...
were
able
to
go
back
and
attend
the
service
without
passing
through
the
main
receiving
gates.
so
to
focus
on
the
no-return
policy
or
to
focus
on
standard
853
is
like
a
magician
hiding
the
ball.
that's
not
the
issue
before
this
court.
the
issue
here
really
is
whether
it
was
possible
to
accommodate
these
inmates.
the
evidence
shows
the
alternate
work
detail
occurred
without
problems.
the
institution,
the
witnesses
during
the
hearing
below
indicated
that
muslim
inmates
do
not
pose
any
greater
security
problems
for
the
institution
than
any
other
inmates.
mr.
james
katz
your
honor,
the
alternate
work
was
not
an
effort
to
avoid
work;
the
alternate
work
was
cutting
wood.
they
weren't
trying
to
get
out
of
their
responsibilities,
and
the
institution
could
use
any
work
it
wanted
to
employ
in
the
alternate
work
detail.
so
it's
not--
mr.
james
katz
--your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record,
frankly,
that
their
concern
was
related
to
this
alternate
work
detail.
this
alternate
work
detail
occurred.
it
was
in
existence.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
alternate
work
detail
posed
any
problems.
there's
no
reason
why
that
alternate
work
detail
couldn't
have
been
a
mixed
detail.
that
same--
mr.
james
katz
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
potential
security
concerns
to
be
considered.
but
what
the
third
circuit's
test
rejected
was
the
notion
that
sincerely...
beliefs
that
are
merely
sincerely
held
and
arguably
correct
are
insufficient,
particularly
when
there
is
no
relationship
between
the
institution's
security
concerns
and
the
religious
practice
at
issue.
the
test,
it
seems
to
me
from
the
third
circuit,
permits
those
concerns
to
be
evaluated.
the
third
circuit
does
not
fail
to
accord
deference
to
the
institution.
the
third
circuit
appreciated
the
deference
that
needed
to
be
accorded.
but
what
it
sought
to
do,
as
petitioners
even
concede
in
their
brief,
it
sought
to
establish
a
test
that
would
protect
these
fundamental
rights
that
are
at
issue
here.
we
are
not
seeking
to
establish
a
hierarchy
of
constitutional
rights.
all
constitutional
rights
are
equally
important.
what
we
are
seeking
here
is
a
standard
which
is
appropriate
for
the
rights
in
question.
petitioners
rely
on
the
cases
of
pell,
jones
and
bell
as
supporting
their
standard
here.
those
cases,
if
we
look
at
the
facts
of
those
cases,
one,
they
didn't
involve
free
exercise
claims.
two,
those
cases
permitted
deference
where
the
institution--
mr.
james
katz
--i
think
we
need...
i
think
that's
just
the
beginning
of
the
analysis,
your
honor.
mr.
james
katz
it
makes
a
difference,
your
honor,
if
the
difference
is
a
time,
place
and
manner
regulation,
which
those
cases
involved,
in
a
free
exercise
claim.
this
court
has
applied
different
standards
to
time,
place
and
manner
regulations.
mr.
james
katz
has
this...
under...
it
has,
to
free
speech
claims
that
were
time,
place
and
manner
regulations,
certainly.
and
those
opinions
make
clear...
the
pell
opinion
is
very
clear...
that
what
was
a
predicate
to
its
opinion
is
that
there
were
readily
available
alternatives
that
could
accommodate
the
inmates'
rights.
and
it
went
through
those
alternatives
very
carefully.
similarly,
the
same
analysis
was
applied
in
bell.
bell
was
the
publisher-only
rule.
and
that
prevented
books,
hard
back
books
unless
they
came
from
publishers,
book
stores,
or
book
clubs.
and
what
the
court
based
its
decision
on
was
the
fact
that
there
were
readily
available
alternatives
that
could
accommodate
those
inmates'
rights.
in
jones,
a
similar
analysis
was
applied
regarding
bulk
mailing.
those
cases,
it
wasn't
just
the
fact
that
these
issues
are
occurring
in
what
i
would
call
the
geographical
approach
to
constitutional
rights.
it's
not
just
the
fact
that
these
cases
occurred
in
a
prison.
the
analysis,
it
seems
to
me,
was
more
focused
than
that,
and
the
court's
approach
was...
it
seemed
to
me,
took
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
there
were
readily
available
alternatives;
that
the
regulations
were
time,
place
and
manner
regulations;
that
they
were
content-neutral;
and
that
the
practices
themselves
did
not
pose
any...
were
not
presumptively
dangerous.
in
contrast
here,
we
don't
have
a
time,
place
and
manner
regulation.
we
have
an
absolute
prohibition
on
a
religious
service
which
the
district
court
found
and
petitioner
does
not
contend--
mr.
james
katz
--with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
they
said.
they
are
holding
a
service
on
midday
on
friday.
the
service
can
be
attended
by
the
inmates
who
are
the
most
dangerous
to
the
institution,
maximum
security
inmates.
and
indeed,
they
permitted
other
inmates
to
attend
that
service
prior
to
march,
1984.
so
it's
not
a
case
where
the
institution
has
said,
we're
not
going
to
hold
services
on
friday.
moreover,
this
is
not
a
case--
mr.
james
katz
--with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
it
said
we
are
not
going
to
permit
the
alternate
work
detail
to
continue,
and
we
are
not
going
to
permit
minimum
security
inmates
to
come
back
on
their
own
to
attend
the
service,
where
that
service
has
posed
no
problems;
and--
mr.
james
katz
--because
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
and
i
can't
believe
that
this
court
has
ever
recognized...
not
that
it
couldn't
do
it
here...
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
recognized
the
notion
of
a
time,
place
and
manner
regulation
in
a
free
exercise
context,
where
you're
talking
about
a
particular
service
that
has
unique
religious
content,
and
that
religious
content
is
predicated
upon
holding
the
service
at
a
particular
time
during
the
day.
in
effect,
what
this
court
would
be
doing,
and
in
effect,
what
the
state
would
be
doing,
is,
you
would
be
becoming
the
arbiters
of
scriptural
interpretation.
you
would
effectively
be
saying
to
these
inmates
that
you
can
satisfy
your
religious
needs
by
having
this
service
at
a
later
time.
or
you
can
satisfy
your
religious
needs
by
having
a
pork
free
diet.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not
the
place
for
either
the--
mr.
james
katz
--absolutely,
your
honor.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
third
circuit's
opinion
recognizes
that.
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
and
what
the
third
circuit
recognizes
is,
you
do
lose
certain
rights
when
you're
incarcerated,
but
you
do
not
lose
all
of
those
rights.
and
you
do
not
lose
those
rights
that
are
inconsistent
with
your
status
as
a
prisoner.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
has
recognized
that
indeed
not
only
does
religion
frequently
serve
the
rehabilitative
efforts
of
institutions,
but
there
is
nothing
inherently
inconsistent
about
religion
in
the
context
of
a
prison;
frequently,
religion
is
beneficial,
and
history
shows
that
religion
has
been
beneficial.
so
it
seems
to
me...
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
situation
which
was
inherently
inconsistent
with
a
presumptively
dangerous
activity.
that's
not
this
case.
that's
not
free
exercise.
and
indeed,
this
court
has
made
that
distinction,
but
the
distinction
doesn't
apply
here.
the
petitioners
talk
about
the
institution's
security
concerns,
and
legitimate
security
concerns.
no
one
argues
with
that.
but
security
is
not
a
tailsmanic
phrase
that
automatically
results
in
the
deprivation
of
basic
first
amendment
guarantees.
it
is
true,
a
naked
inmate
in
a
bare
cell
who
is
bound
poses
no
security
problems
for
the
institution.
but
from
that
point
on,
every
time
you
apply
a
little
more
freedom,
that
will
pose
a
potential
security
risk.
but
that,
in
and
of
itself,
is
not
grounds
to
deny
basic
constitutional
rights.
not
every
step
that
is
taken
to
protect
fundamental
guarantees
will
result
in
chaos
or
disorder.
and
indeed,
on
the
record
of
this
case,
the
rationale
which
the
state
has
offered
for
depriving
these
inmates
of
attending
this
basic
service
simply
is
not
justified.
the
alternate
work
detail
was
in
existence.
there
were
no
problems.
muslim
inmates
don't
pose
any
problems,
at
least
according
to
the
testimony.
there
were
jobs
available.
and
the
question
should
be:
can
we
both
accommodate--
mr.
james
katz
--no,
no.
all
that
is--
mr.
james
katz
--absolutely,
your
honor.
the
only
issue
that
the
third
circuit
decided
was
the
appropriate
test.
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
what
is
the
appropriate
test.
it
will
ultimately
be
up
to
the
district
court
to
apply
the
facts
to
that
test.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
look
at
the
test
that
the
third
circuit
has
applied
here,
it's
a
test
of
mutual
accommodation.
it's
not
a
test
that
seeks
to
substitute
the
inmates'
commands
of
conscience
for
the
institution's
legitimate
security
concerns.
it
is
a
test
that
seeks
to
balance
both
of
them.
it's
a
test
that
seeks
to
accommodate
both
of
them.
mr.
james
katz
i
do
not
read
the
opinion
as
requiring
a
least
restrictive
alternative.
indeed,
although
this
may
not
always
be
the
case,
i
don't
even
see
the
words,
least
restrictive
alternative,
anywhere
in
that
opinion.
that
is
not
necessarily
dispositive,
certainly.
but
what
the
test--
mr.
james
katz
--it
said...
and
you
need
to
emphasize
the
word
"reasonable",
and
it
was
talking
about
a
reasonable
method.
it
didn't
say,
no
method.
and
i
think
that's...
that's
an
important
distinction.
moreover,
it
seems
to
me,
you
may
have
various
alternatives,
which
can
equally
accommodate
the
institution's
legitimate
security
concerns,
as
well
as
the
inmates'
commands
of
conscience.
it
would
be
appropriate,
under
this
court's
approaches
in
pell
and
its
progeny
that
when
you
have
readily
available
alternatives,
we
should
defer.
and
so
if
you
do
have
readily
available
alternatives,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
defer
to
the
view
of
the
institution
to
accommodate
those
alternatives.
but
that
was
not
the
case
here.
we
were
not
dealing
here
with
readily
available
alternatives;
we
were
dealing
here
with
an
absolute
prohibition.
and
we
need
to
emphasize,
the
problem
with
the
st.
claire
tests,
and
i
understand
this
court,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals,
certainly
is
not
bound
by
anything
the
third
circuit
said
as
regarding
the
st.
claire
test,
nor
are
you
bound
by
anything
that
was
said
in
this
test.
mr.
james
katz
as
i
read
the
opinion,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
third
circuit
put
that
burden
on
the
state.
mr.
james
katz
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
faces--
mr.
james
katz
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
faced
with
the
alternative--
mr.
james
katz
--i
understand
what...
what
you're
referring
to.
but
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
state
would
only
be
bound
by
the
alternatives
that
were
put
forth
by
the
inmates,
unless
the
state
could
come
up
with
some
other
alternatives.
but
i
don't
think
it's...
i
don't
think
it's
an
endless
exercise.
and
i
think
it
contrasts
with
the
st.
claire
standard
which
the
third
circuit
was
operating
under.
the
st.
claire
standard
merely
said
that
there
needed
to
be
a
potential
threat
to
security
and
that
the
institution's
position
was
sincerely
held...
i
doubt
whether
you'd
ever
have
a
situation
where
a
warden
would
testify
that
his
beliefs
were
not
sincerely
held...
and
arguably
correct.
and
then
the
burden
shifted
to
the
inmates
to
demonstrate
by
substantial
evidence...
not
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
which
is
the
normal
standard
in
civil
cases,
but
by
substantial
evidence...
that
these
security
concerns
were
either
exaggerated
or
unreasonable.
that
is
a
minimal
standard--
mr.
james
katz
--substantial
evidence,
i
believe,
as
the
third
circuit
stated
in
cole,
which
was
a
subsequent
decision,
is
a
greater
burden
than
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
that's
what
the
third...
that's
how
the
third
circuit
has
interpreted
the
opinion.
moreover,
in
either
the
st.
claire
test
or
a
rational
relationship
test,
contrary...
and
with
all
due
respect
to
what
the
solicitor
general
argued
here
this
morning...
there
is
no
requirement
to
reach
readily
available
alternatives,
because
you
may
never
get
there.
and
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
evidences
that.
the
state
has
proposed
the
no-return
policy
as
being
rational.
it's
a
general
prison
policy.
and
that
policy
may
very
well
be
rational.
and
under
the
st.
claire
test,
the
state's
burden
ends,
and
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
inmates
to
demonstrate
that
it's
exaggerated.
it
very
well
may
not
be
exaggerated.
but
that
doesn't
deal
with
the
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
you
can
accommodate
the
fundamental
constitutional
guarantees.
and
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
there
is
no
connection
with
the
inmates'
religious
rights
and
the
institution's
legitimate
security
concerns,
you
will
fail
to
get
to
those
alternatives.
and
that,
frankly,
is
the
problem
with
the
test
as
proposed.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
the
third
circuit
was
concerned
about;
and
that
is
the
reason,
and
it
was
the
appreciation
of
that
fact,
which
led
the
third
circuit
to
an
approach
which
could
more
appropriately
both
accommodate
the
institution's
security
concerns
as
well
as
the
inmates'
religious
rights.
the
petitioners
have
discussed
the
problems
with
this
test.
and
they
go
through
a
number
of
potential
problems.
first,
they
claim
that
it
will
result
in
frivolous
claims.
i
submit
that
frivolous
claims
should
be
dealt
with
precisely
like
that;
they
should
be
dealt
with
as
frivolous
claims.
that
should
not
be
a
vehicle
to
eviscerate
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
second,
they
argue
that
inmates
will
recast
their
claims
as
free
exercise
claims.
first
of
all,
what
is
ignored
here
is,
regardless
of
the
test,
there
is
a
predicate
which
must
be
reached,
whether
we
are
talking
about
a
rational
relationship
test
or
a
mutual
accommodation
test
or
an
arguably
correct
sincerely
held
test.
and
that
predicate,
which
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff,
the
plaintiff
must
prove
that
the
rights
are
religiously
based
and
sincerely
held.
and
that
is
going
to
apply
regardless
of
the
test.
and
that
is
an
appropriate
standard
to
contest
the
religious
claims
of
inmates.
secondly,
the
free
exercise
clause,
as
it
has
existed,
obviously,
the
standards
of
that
have
not
resulted
in
a
rash
of
efforts
by
individuals
in
a
free
society
to
recast
their
claims
as
free
exercise
claims.
mr.
james
katz
it's
certainly
true
that
to
the
extent
you
recognize
fundamental
constitutional
guarantees--
mr.
james
katz
--no,
it...
it
certainly...
it
certainly
is
true.
but
the
question
is,
it
seems
to
me,
whether
that
is
a
justification,
in
and
of
itself,
number
one,
to
deny
those
claims;
and
number
two,
whether
there
are
not
vehicles
by
which
judges
and
the
courts
can
distinguish
that
fact.
indeed,
that
was
an
effort
this
court
recognized
in
sherbert
and
in
other
free
exercise
cases,
that
there
is
a
possibility
for
fraud
anytime
you
recognize
constitutional
guarantees,
and
anytime
you
recognize
free
exercise
guarantees.
but
i
think...
i
have
confidence
that
the
courts
are
able
to
distinguish
between
those
claims
which
are
legitimate
and
those
claims
which
are
fraudulent.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
appropriate
vehicle
to
do
that
is
to
deny
basic
constitutional
guarantees.
there
are
other
ways
that
that
can
be
achieved
without
denying
those
very
basic
and
essential
rights.
and
this
should
not
be
the
vehicle
that's
used
to
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
essential
to
look
at
here
is
the
nature
of
the
right
that's
being
asserted.
it's
not
a
novel
program.
we're
not
seeking
to
implement
a
new
initiative.
what
we
are
seeking
to
do
is
the
continuation
of
a
practice
which
has
occurred
without
incident
for
five
years.
secondly,
we
are
not
seeking...
we
are
not
seeking
to
be
treated
differently
than
others.
this
institution
already
provides
on
saturday
and
sunday
for
adherents
with
religions
on
those
days,
the
right
to
attend
religious
services.
we're
simply
seeking
to
be
treated
equally.
and
i
might
note
that
the
institution
claims
a
lot
of...
the
problem
of
overcrowding.
and
there
are
a
couple
of
points
that
i
think
need
to
be
recognized
regarding
that.
one,
suddenly
on
weekends,
when
all
of
the
inmates
are
confined
to
the
institution,
when
there
are
virtually
no
outside
work
details,
and
where
there
are
less
guards
available,
the
problems
of
overcrowding
disappear
when
it
comes
to
providing
religious
services
for
those
whose
sabbath
falls
on
a
saturday
or
sunday.
so
it
seems
to
me
we
are
in
effect
establishing
a
different
standard
for
those
whose
religion
falls
on
different
days.
thirdly,
overcrowding,
in
and
of
itself...
i
think
it
is
extremely
dangerous
when
we
permit
that
to
be
the
rationale
to
eviscerate
basic
constitutional
rights.
this
overcrowding
was
not
an
emergency
procedure...
emergency
problem
that
suddenly
arose
in
1984.
the
governor's
executive
orders
had
been
in
existence
in
1981,
and
effectively,
what
we're
doing
here,
is
because
the
state,
for
whatever
reason,
has
failed
to
appropriate
the
needed
funds
to
relieve
the
overcrowding
situation,
it's
then
able
to
bootstrap
on
that
fact
by
denying
these
basic
constitutional
guarantees
to
these
inmates.
mr.
james
katz
i
think
that
the
overcrowding
should
be
a...
a
factor,
and
indeed,
i
don't
think
the
third
circuit's
test
precludes--
mr.
james
katz
--may
be
considered
in
weighing
whether
there
is
a
possibility
to
accommodate
both
the
security
interest
and
the
commands
of
conscience.
it
shouldn't
be
the
sole
rationale
by
which
they
can
simply
ab
initio
wipe
away
these
basic
constitutional
guarantees.
it
is
important
to
understand
what
is
at
issue
here.
what
is
at
issue
is
the
right
to
pray,
a
basic
issue
at
the
heart
of
the
free
exercise
guarantee.
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
prisoners
and
prisons
are
dark
and
dingy
worlds.
and
frequently,
it
is
prayer
which
is
the
light.
it
is
prayer
which
provides
the
candle
of
hope.
i
urge
this
court
not
to
snuff
out
that
light,
not
to
snuff
out
that
candle.
unless
the
court
has
anything
further.
