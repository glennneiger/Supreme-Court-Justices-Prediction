--what
if
the
prisoner
comes
in
and
shows
what
he
claims
to
be
an
equally,
but
less
burdensome,
alternative
to
serve
the
penalogical
interest,
and
the
prison
official
says,

guess
there
is
that
alternative,
but

just
don't
want
to
follow
it,
because
our
rule
certainly
serves
a
penalogical

"everybody
agrees
with
that.

prisoner
says,
"i
agree
it
serves
it,
but
it
is
too
broad.
"
"it's
more
restrictive
than
necessary.

prison
official
says,
"so
what"?

is

way
of
proceeding
without
sacrificing
either
the
state's
interest

the

must

must
a

so
you
