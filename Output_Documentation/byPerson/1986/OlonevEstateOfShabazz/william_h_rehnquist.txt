chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
now
hear
argument
no.
85-1722,
edward
o'lone
versus
the
estate
of
ahmad
uthman
shabazz
and
another
respondent.
ms.
hodian,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
hodian,
was
the
third
circuit's
new
test
in
this
case
applicable
just
to
free
exercise
of
religion
claims
on
behalf
of
the
prisoners,
or
was
it
across
the
board;
do
you
know?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
jones
and
pell
are
the
controlling
cases
in
this
court,
aren't
they?
i
mean,
we
needn't
deal
directly
with
the
st.
claire
case,
which
is
authority
only
in
the
third
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hodian.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
clegg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
clegg,
isn't
there
some
danger
of
just
picking
up
phrases
from
out
of
various
opinions
and
treating
them
as
if
they
were
constitutional
doctrine?
if
you
have
the
idea
that
the
thing
has
to
be
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
concern,
presumably,
these
other
factors
will
come
into
that
test
not
as
separate
elements--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
as
simply
a
logical
inquiry
as
to
whether
something
is
reasonably
related
to
a
penalogical
concern.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
do
we
really
need
a
handbook
to
say,
first,
the
prison
officials
say
this;
then
the
prisoners
go...
i
mean,
as
if
it's
stage
1,
2,
3,
4?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
again,
if
the
test
is
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
concern,
presumably,
judges
and
lawyers
can
figure
out
how
a
case
like
that
should
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clegg.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
katz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
mr.
katz,
why
should
it
make
a
difference
that
those
cases
didn't
involve
free
exercise
claims
if
they
involved
some
other
claim
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
does
it...
i
asked
you,
why
does
it
make
a
difference.
why
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
has
it
applied
different
standards
to
free
speech
claims
as
opposed
to
free
exercise
claims?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it's
not
a
time,
place
and
manner
regulation,
but
again,
that
may
be
largely
a
matter
of
description.
you
can
see...
you
can
say
that
the
prison
officials
said
there
weren't
going
to
be
any
religious
services
at
midday
on
friday.
now
that's
a
time,
place
and
manner
regulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
said,
we're
not
going
to
bring
a
gang
in
from
outside
for
a
midday
service.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
that
a
time,
place
and
manner
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
katz.
the
case
is
submitted.
