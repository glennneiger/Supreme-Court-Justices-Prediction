mr.
roger
clegg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
test
do
we
use
to
determine
when
a
prison
rule
violates
a
prisoner's
free
exercise
rights.
it
is
our
position,
along
with
new
jersey,
that
the
rule
should
be
left
alone,
if
it
is
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest.
i
want
to
make
two
points,
that
the
test
we--
mr.
roger
clegg
--that's
correct.
mr.
roger
clegg
well--
mr.
roger
clegg
--yes.
mr.
roger
clegg
--it
certainly
is.
mr.
roger
clegg
the
alternatives,
whether
the
response
was
an
exaggerated
one.
let
me
outline
how
i
think
that
the
test
would
work
in
a
typical
case.
the
prisoner
would
have
to
come
in
and
show,
first
of
all,
the
the
prison
rule
that
was
being
challenged
infringed
on
his
free
exercise
of
religion.
it
would
then
be
up
to
the
state
to
show
that
the
regulation
was
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest.
the
prisoner
would
then
have
to
show
that
the
state
was
wrong,
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
showing
that
the
rule
was
not
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest.
one
way
that
he
could
do
that
is
by
showing
that
it
was
an
exaggerated
response.
and
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
one
indicium
of
an
exaggerated
response
is
the
presence
of
easy
and
obvious
alternatives.
no
one
can
fault
the
respondents
for
wanting
to
attend
their
religious
service.
the
prison
officials
have
been
handed
a
very
difficult
job
by
society.
they
are
supposed
to
protect
society
from
the
prisoners
and
the
prisoners
from
one
another,
while
trying
to
rehabilitate
them,
all
on
meager
budgets.
i
want
to
stress
that
when
officials
act
out
of
security
concerns,
one
of
their
principal
objectives
is
to
protect
the
lives
and
safety
of
other
prisoners.
so
the
trade-off
in
this
case
wasn't
just
between
respondents'
religious
claims
and
the
petitioner's
satisfaction
of
having
a
well-run
program.
the
trade-off
was
between
these
two
prisoners'
religious
claims
and
the
safety
of
all
the
other
prisoners,
as
well
as
the
safety
of
guards
and
society
as
a
whole.
you
can
also
see
in
this
case
that
the
respondents'
return
to
the
prison
would
disrupt
the
rehabilitation
program
of
all
the
other
prisoners.
now,
someone
has
to
make
this
delicate
trade-off
between
the
desires
and
needs
of
the
various
prisoners.
in
the
federal
system,
this
decision
is
especially
ticklish,
given
the
wide
range
of
religions
and
the
potential
for
proliferation
of
claims.
obviously,
this
is
a
very
subjective
decision,
which
can
be
done
well
only
by
those
familiar
with
prisons
and
prisoners.
it
is
not
a
decision
well
suited
to
intensive
review.
this
is
why
the
right
standard
is
to
leave
the
prison
rule
alone
when
it
is
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest.
to
require
that
the
rule
be
for
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
it
be
the
least
restrictive
means
for
achieving
it
will
inevitably
mean
that
courts
will
not
give
prison
officials
the
deference
they
are
due.
mr.
roger
clegg
no,
i
think
there
has
to
be
more
than
that.
mr.
roger
clegg
well,
this
court
has
said
in
bell
and
in
block
versus
rutherford
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
better
way
of
doing
things
does
not
suffice.
and
i
think
that
that's
right.
mr.
roger
clegg
no,
but
i
think
that
the
analysis
has
to
be
the
same.
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
it
doesn't
make
sense
and
it's
not
right
to
rank
constitutional
rights.
bell
was
a
case
that
did
involve
first
amendment
rights,
hardback
books.
mr.
roger
clegg
so
i
think
that
the
analysis
should
be
the
same,
at
lease
within
the
first
amendment.
i
think--
mr.
roger
clegg
--no.
i
mean,
the
exaggerated
response
language
is
taken
from
pell
versus
procunier,
and
it
was
quoted
again
in
jones
versus
north
carolina
prisoners'
union.
i
think
it
is
something
that
this
court
has
applied
in
these
other
first
amendment
cases
and
should
continue
to
be
applied.
but
to
answer
your
question,
the
fact
that
there
are
alternatives
is
evidence
of
an
exaggerated
response,
and
the
easier
and
more
obvious
they
are,
the
stronger
evidence
it
is.
but
the
prison
official
does
not
have
to
show
that
there
is
absolutely
no
other
way
that
this
can
be
achieved.
and
in
any
event,
the
burden
is
on
the
prisoner
at
that
point
of
showing
that
there
are
these
other
alternatives.
mr.
roger
clegg
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
roger
clegg
that's
correct,
and
that's
why
i
say
that
the
way
we
see
the
test
as
working
is
that
the
prison
officials
first
show
that
it
is
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest.
mr.
roger
clegg
no.
mr.
roger
clegg
that's
correct.
and
i
broke
it
down
that
way
so
that
it
would
be
clear
what
the
prison
officials
had
to
show,
what
the
burden
was
on
them
to
show,
that
the
burden
is
not
on
them
to
show
anything
about
the
alternatives--
mr.
roger
clegg
--that
is
something--
mr.
roger
clegg
--the
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
that
rule
is
reasonable.
if
the
alternative
is
one
that
is
easy
and
obvious
and
the
denial
is
one
that
is
dramatic
and
central,
these
are
all
things
that
will
be
of
evidentiary
value
in
determining
whether
or
not
this
rule
is
unreasonable.
but
it
does
not
automatically
follow
that...
as
this
court
said
in
bell
and
block...
that
because
there
is
another
alternative,
that
that
has
to
be
followed.
it
is
only
if
the
presence
of
that
other
alternative
shows
that
what
was
adopted
was
unreasonable,
that
the
prisoner
will
win.
i
should
also
stress
that
while
our
standard
gives
judicial
deference
to
prison
officials,
it
is
not
a
blank
check.
this
standard
need
not
be,
and
has
not
been,
a
toothless
one.
in
the
rare
instance
when
a
prison
acts
irrationally
or
maliciously,
it
will
afford
the
prisoner
redress.
finally,
a
strict
scrutiny
standard
is
unnecessary.
as
justice
scalia
noted,
prison
officials
recognize
that
religion
is
a
positive
force,
not
only
as
a
general
matter,
but
in
terms
of
the
prison's
own
interest,
particularly
of
security
and
rehabilitation.
and
they
also
recognize
that
people
feel
strongly
about
religion,
and
that
there
is
no
point
in
needlessly
provoking
a
confrontation
about
it.
mr.
roger
clegg
well,
it
doesn't
go
down
the
tubes.
mr.
roger
clegg
it
should
give
you
some
reassurance
in
the
religion
context.
i
think--
mr.
roger
clegg
--yes,
yes.
but
i
think
that...
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
new
about
it.
i
think
that
the
reasonableness
inquiry
has
teeth.
i
mean,
this
court's
decisions
under
the
equal
protection
clause
show
that.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
new
jersey
officials
were
very
sympathetic
to
the
muslims'
desire
to
attend
jumu'ah,
and
that
respondents
themselves
recognized
in
their
brief
that
the
federal
prisons
share
this
sympathy.
so
religious
practices
will
be
accommodated
unless
and
until
they
begin
to
threaten
the
safety
of
other
prisoners,
or
the
prison's
efforts
at
rehabilitation,
or
some
other
legitimate
penalogical
interest.
