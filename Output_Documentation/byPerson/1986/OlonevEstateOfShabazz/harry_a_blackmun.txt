justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
i
ask:
how
does
your
practice
compare
with
that
in
a
federal
prison?
now,
i
realize
the
sg
is
on
your
side.
but
would
not
what
is
banned
here
have
been
permitted
in
a
federal
prison?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
think
there's
greater
accommodation
on
the
federal
side
than
there
is
in
new
jersey.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
there
any
limit
to
your
position?
aren't
you,
in
effect,
saying
if
the
prison
authorities
say
it
must
be
thus
and
so,
that's
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
the
rule
of
75
years
ago.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
ms.
hodian--
--are
you
familiar
with
judge
kaufman's
decision
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
abdul
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

do
you
think
of
it?
