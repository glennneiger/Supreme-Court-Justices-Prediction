justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
meaning
of
the
statute
a
factual
issue?
i
would
think
that
that's
a
legal
issue.
and
indeed,
haven't
we
in
earlier
cases
abstained
from
passing
on
the
constitutionality
of
statutes
until
the
state
courts
could
tell
us
what
their
own
statute
meant?
isn't
the
meaning
of
it
ultimately
a
question
of
louisiana
law
for
the
louisiana
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
within
its
prerogative?
within
whose
prerogatives
would
it
be,
if
not
within
the
prerogatives
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
we,
as
a
federal
court,
say
that
the
louisiana
statute
means
x,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
couldn't
say,
no,
it
doesn't
mean
x,
it
means
y?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
order
that
we
can
say
whether
it
means
x.
i
mean,
ultimately,
you
want
us
to
say
whether
it
means
x
or
y.
and
why
is
that
our
business
rather
than
the
louisiana
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
after
which...
after
which
a
federal
court
will
say
whether
it
means
x
or
y.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
just
quarreling
that
it
was
done
too
soon;
not
that
it
shouldn't
be
done
by
federal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i'm
questioning
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if
louisiana
chooses
to
use
a
technical
term
in
an
inaccurate
sense?
can
it
do
that
if
it
wants
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
could.
and
isn't
it
up
to
louisiana
state
court
to
say
whether
it's
using
a
technical
term
accurately
or
inaccurately?
it
could
use
that
term
any
way
it
wants,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bird,
before
you
go
further,
you
acknowledge
before
that
a
purpose
was...
tertiary
purpose
on
the
part
of
some
legislators
was
to
teach
religious
doctrine.
assuming
i
think
that
only
a
purpose
that
is
effectuated
in
the
statute
is
relevant,
do
you
acknowledge
that
that
purpose
is
effectuated
in
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
necessarily
require
the
teaching
of
a
god,
a
personal
god,
as
opposed
to
a
first
cause
that
may
be
quite
impersonal,
or
a
giant
slug,
for
all
we
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
or
may
not
be
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
either
a
factual
issue
or
an
issue
of
law
to
be
decided
by
some
court.
it
depends
on
what
creation
in
the
statute
means,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
we
go
to
the
affidavits
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
we
go
to
the
affidavits
in
the
case?
now,
this...
this
was
decided
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
an
affidavit
by
dr.
scott
morrow,
a
doctor
in
biochemistry.
justice
antonin
scalia
academic
credentials.
which
said
creation...
ph.d.
in
biochemistry
from
the
university
of
north
carolina,
m.s.,
st.
joseph
college.
creation
science,
he
said,
is
a
scientific
model
or
hypothesis
that
attempts
to
account
for
the
origins
of
material
entities
or
systems
in
our
world
by
means
of
their
relatively
sudden
or
abrupt
appearance.
now,
that
is
really
not
the
way
i
would
be
inclined
to
define
it.
but
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
a
biochemist.
now,
here
you
have
an
affidavit
that's
filed
in
the
case
that
says
it
means
that.
how
can
i
be
sure
that
it
doesn't
mean
that?
and
anyway,
is
it
either
my
view
or
dr.
morrow's
that
ought
to
govern,
but
rather
the
view
of
the...
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
plain
language,
with
resort
to
legislative
history?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
aristotle's
view
of
a
first
cause,
an
unmoved
mover?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
a
creationist
view?
i
don't
think
aristotle
considered
himself
as
theologian
as
opposed
to
a
philosopher.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact,
he
probably
considered
himself
a
scientist.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
want
to
go
back
earlier.
[laughter]
because
my
next
question
is
going
to
be
whether
you
considered
aristotleanism
a
religion?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
you
could
believe
in
a
first
cause,
an
unmoved
mover,
that
may
be
impersonal,
and
has
no
obligation
of
obedience
or
veneration
from
men,
and
in
fact,
doesn't
care
what's
happening
to
mankind.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
believe
in
creation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
ask
you,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
divine.
if
all
you
mean
is
a
first
cause,
an
impersonal
mover--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
statute
doesn't
say
"divine".
justice
antonin
scalia
all
it
says
is
"creation".
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
louisiana
legislature
that
determines
what
louisiana
statutes
mean?
or
is
the
louisiana
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
a
doctrine--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
topkis--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
question
is
sort
of
like
the
chief
justice's
last
question,
but
i
think
it's
a
little
closer
to
this
case.
i'm
concerned
about
whether
purpose
alone
would
invalidate
a
state
action,
if
a
state
action
has
a
perfectly
valid
secular
purpose.
let's
assume
that
there
is
an
ancient
history
professor
in
a
state
high
school
who
has
been
teaching
that
the
roman
empire
did
not
extent
to
the
southern
shore
of
the
mediterranean
in
the
1st
century
a.d.--
and
let's
assume
a
group
of
protestants
who
are
concerned
about
that
fact,
inasmuch
as
it
makes
it
seem
that
the
biblical
story
of
the
crucifixion
has
things
a
bit
wrong...
because
of
that
concern,
and
really,
no
other
reason...
i
mean,
this
fellow's
also
teaching
other
things
that
are
wrong.
he's
teaching
that
the
parthians
came
out
of
egypt.
they
don't
care
about
that.
they
do
care
that
romans
were
in
jerusalem
in
the
1st
century
a.d.
so
they
go
to
the
principal
of
the
school,
and
say,
this
history
professor
is
teaching
what
is
just
falsehood.
i
mean,
everybody
knows
that
rome
was
there.
and
the
principal
says,
gee,
you're
right.
and
he
goes
in
and
directs
the
teacher
to
teach
that
rome
was
on
the
southern
short
of
the
mediterranean
in
the
1st
century
a.d.--
clearly
a
religious
motivation.
the
only
reason
the
people
were
concerned
about
that,
as
opposed
to
the
parthians,
was
the
fact
that
it
contradicted
their
religious
view.
now,
would
it
be
unconstitutional
for
the
principal
to
listen
to
them,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
religious
motivation,
to
make
the
change
in
the
high
school?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
here,
do
we
know
that
the
state
is
acting
out
of
religious
motivation?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
the
case
i
gave,
if
it
was
the
school
board
that
went
to
the
high
school
principal,
and
the
members
of
the
school
board
were
upset
about
this,
as
opposed
to
parthia,
because
of
their
religious
affiliations,
then
it
would
be
bad,
and
you
would
have
to
leave
the
teacher
in
and
continue
to
teach
that
rome
was
not
on
the
southern
shore
of
the
mediterranean.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
he's
directed
by
the
school
board.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you
there.
and
once
you
say
that
what
they're
doing
is
teaching
religion,
it's
a
different
ballgame.
if
that
is
motivated
by
a
religious
purpose,
then
i
think
you're
quite
right.
but
that
is
an
essential
part
of
what
you
have
to
establish,
though,
isn't
it?
not
just
that
a
secular
action
is
ultimately
motivated
by
some
religious
concern?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
i'm
with
you
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
topkis.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
your
legislative
history,
and
you
know,
i've
read
it,
there
are
statements
of
the
sort
you...
you
quoted,
including
some
by
the
sponsor
of
this,
especially
the
first
time
around,
the
bill
that
was
in
a
different
form
and
didn't
get
passed.
but
isn't
what
counts
what
the
intent
of
the
entire
legislature
was?
and
i
just...
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
louisiana
was
a
state
dominated
by...
religiously
by
fundamentalists.
and
i
think
the
statistics
bear
that
out.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
catholics
and
atheists
alone...
or
acnostics
alone...
account
for
56
percent
of
the
population.
never
mind
some
other
religious
groups
that
are
not
necessarily
fundamentalists.
now,
it
was,
after
all,
the
entire
legislature
that
passed
the
bill.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
maybe
the
motive
of
those
who
introduced
it
and
were
most
zealous
for
it
may
have
been
a
fundamentalist
christian
motive,
but
can
we
be
sure
that
that
was
the
motive
of
the
entire
legislature
of
louisiana
in
passing
the
bill?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
balance
secular
purpose.
now,
what
they're
saying
is--
true.
--most
of
the
imbalance
complained
of
is
complained
of
on
religious
grounds.
but
isn't
righting
what
the
state
legislature
considered
an
imbalance
in
instruction
a
secular
purpose;
that
only
one
side
of
an
issue
is
being
presented?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
the
experts
who
provided
affidavits
were
agnostics,
at
least
one
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
said
he
was
an
agnostic.
is
there
any
difference
in
your
mind
between
purpose
of
the
law
and
motivation
of
those
who
want
to
get
the
law
enacted?
i
mean,
in
the
example
i
gave
you
earlier
where
the
school
board
directs
a
change
in
the
ancient
history
instruction
motivated
by
the
fact
that
this
particular
error
is
inconsistent
with
their
religious
beliefs,
although
teaching
it
right
doesn't
necessarily
make
their
religious
beliefs
any
more
credible,
would
you
say
that
there
they
had
an
evil
purpose,
that
the
purpose
of
the
change
was
a
religious
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
school
board
is
moved
to
correct
the
instructor
whose
teaching
the
wrong
thing
about
rome--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
the
fact
that
it's
inconsistent
with
their
religious
beliefs.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
makes
their
religious
look
absurd.
not
that
it
makes
their
religious
beliefs
believable
if
you
teach
the
right
thing
about
rome.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
that's
the
reason
they're
concerned
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
would
you
say
that
there
purpose
is
to
further
their
religion,
or
is
their
purpose
of
get
the
curriculum
right
and
get
the
correct
thing
taught
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
so
it
does
come
back
to
whether
this
statute
requires
the
teaching
of
creation
in
some
divine
sense.
