mr.
wendell
r.
bird
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
an
8-7
decision
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
involves
a
facial
constitutional
challenge
to
louisiana's
law
for
balanced
treatment
of
creation
science
and
evolution
in
public
schools.
that
law
defines
evolution
as
scientific
evidences
supporting
evolution,
and
inferences
from
those
scientific
evidences.
in
parallel,
it
defines
creation
science
as
scientific
evidences
supporting
creation,
and
inferences
from
those
scientific
evidences.
the
state
today
hopes
to
address
two
key
questions:
first,
the
procedural
question
of
the
material
factual
issues,
and
particularly,
the
uncontroverted
affidavits,
which
must
be
addressed
in
order
to
apply
the
tripart
test,
and
which
preclude
summary
judgment;
and
then,
second,
the
constitutional
question,
particularly
of
the
abundant
evidence
in
the
record
of
a
secular
purpose,
although
not
an
exclusively
secular
purpose,
we
concede.
i'll
mention
the
relevant
facts
in
connection
with
each
of
these
two
major
issues.
the
first
major
question
is
the
procedural
question
which
the
state
believes
should
be
decisive.
the
decision
under
review
contradicts
the
unquestioned
procedural
rule
for
summary
judgment
regarding
uncontradicted
affidavits
and
material
factual
issues,
as
the
seven
dissenting
judges
acknowledged.
the
uncontroverted
factual
issues
of
the
state--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--no,
sir,
it
wasn't.
it
was
denial
of
rehearing
en
banc.
and
in
fact,
the
eight
judge
majority
did
not
enter
a
written
opinion.
it
simply
affirmed;
in
effect,
denied
rehearing
of
the
three-judge
opinion.
seven
judges
disagreed
very
strongly.
the
uncontroverted
affidavits--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--yes.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
and
in
this
case,
they
certainly
upheld
that
tradition.
the
uncontroverted
affidavits
of
the
state
on
factual
issues
erroneously
were
not
taken
as
true
or
admitted
for
purposes
of
summary
judgment
and
appeal.
the
other
factual
issues
raised
by
the
state
in
its
brandeis
memorandum
of
630
pages,
with
nearly
2,000
citations,
were
not
viewed
in
the
most
favorable
light,
like
the
affidavits,
and
in
fact,
were
hardly
given
credence
at
all.
they
certainly
weren't
accepted
as
true
for
purposes
of
summary
judgment.
the
facts
in
regard
to
this
procedural
issue
are
that
the
state
filed
affidavits
by
creationist
and
evolutionist
scientists;
by
a
creationist
philosopher;
an
evolutionist
theologian;
and
a
creationist
educator.
they
were
not
only
protestants,
but
two
roman
catholics
and
one
agnostic.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
your
honor,
the
definition
of
creation
science
is
one
very
important
factual
issue,
what
the
statute's
about.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
well,
your
honor,
it
does
give
a
definition
that's
highly
scientific,
and
referring
only
to
scientific
evidences,
and
inferences
from
those
scientific
evidences.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
sir.
a
very
important
factual
issue
in
order--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--because
it
is
bringing
a
term
from
a
technical
term
into
a
statute,
yes,
your
honor,
much
like
in
some
of
the
technical
regulatory
statutes
that
might
take
a
term
of
art
from
another
field
without
attempting
to
give
a
plenary
definition
in
the
statute.
and
besides
the
definition,
another
factual
issue
is
the
religious...
the
nonreligious
nature
of
that
scientific
evidence
supporting
creation.
and
a
third
factual
issue,
the
scientific
nature
of
creation
science
as
compared
with
evolution.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
your
honor,
taking
those
questions
in
reverse,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
reviewed
this
statute
on
different
grounds,
and
has
upheld
it
under
applicable
provisions
of
the
louisiana
constitution
regarding
prescribing
curriculum.
it
did
not
see
fit
to
give
a
definition
of
creation
science,
or
even
to
indicate
that
it
regarded
that
as
within
its
prerogatives.
i'd
suggest--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--because
a
term
that
is
a
technical
term,
a
term
used
within
the
scientific
field,
was
being
embodied
in
the
statute,
the
state
submits,
your
honor,
that
the
definition
of
that
term
is
a
factual
matter,
appropriate
for
resolution
by
expert
testimony
on
that
field,
much
like
if
the
state
had
regulated
some
particular
form
of,
say,
asbestos
contamination,
or
whatever,
and
had
used
technical
terms
of
art.
it
wouldn't
be
an
issue
of
state
law
as
to
what
they
meant,
when
the
intent
was
to
bring
in
a
technical
definition
from
the
relevant
academic
field.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
well,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest,
in
the
context
of
the
procedural
issue,
that
this
court
should
not
be
saying,
the
statute
means
x,
but
instead,
should
allow
the
case
to
go
to
trial,
a
trial
it's
never
had,
in
order
to
develop
a
factual
record
on
that
issue.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
your
honor,
with
all
respect,
what
we
would
like
you
to
say
is
that
this
court
should
not
have
to
say
whether
it
means
x
or
y,
but
that
a
trial,
with
factual
development,
ought
to
occur
to
enable
expert
witnesses
on
both
sides
to
give
definitions.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
not
quite,
your
honor,
because
a
federal
court--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--your
honor,
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--that
the
only
thing
a
federal
court
ought
to
do
is
review
whether
the
factual
determination
by
the
trial
court,
after
a
trial,
is
clearly
erroneous.
this
court,
in
lynch
v.
donnelly,
used
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
in
reviewing
district
court
findings.
and
in
fact,
the
dissenting
opinion
did
the
same
thing
in
footnote
11,
recognizing
the
heavily
factual
issue
of
many
issues
of
that
nature.
the
role
of
this
court,
the
state
would
suggest,
is
not
to
determine,
as
the
two
lower
courts
did,
out
of
thin
air,
what
a
technical
term
means,
but
to
recognize
that
that
is
a
factual
issue,
or
at
least
involved
factual
issues
that
this
court
is
entitled
to
a
trial
record
on
before
this
court
is
asked
to
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
a
state
certainly
could
use
a
term
and
define
it
differently.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
your
honor,
recognizing
the
correctness
of
your
point
about
state
interpretations
of
terms
that
have
a...
have
a
state
law
background
behind
them,
the
term
in
this
statute
was
a
term
borrowed
from
a
technical
field.
and
it's
our
suggestion
that
the
trier
of
fact,
at
the
trial
court
level,
can
correctly
determine
the
meaning
of
that
term,
based
on
the
legislative
history
and
expert
testimony,
whether
that
trier
of
fact
is
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
well,
your
honor,
first,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
notice
that
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
district
court
did
not
rely
at
all
on
the
legislative
history
in
reaching
that
determination.
they
instead
said,
effectively
by
judicial
notice
we
submit,
creation
science
means
x.
it
means
religious
doctrine
including
a
creator.
not
based
on
any
factual
evidence
in
the
record,
but
just
a
priori.
and
consequently,
those
courts
were
not
even
applying
the
purpose
prong
of
the
establishment
clause
test
in
the
way
that
this
court
has
indicated
it
should
be
applied.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
your
honor,
that
might
be
possible
given
two
caveats.
the
first
is
that
the
legislative
history
does
involve
technical
terms
of
science,
not
only
terms
such
as
creation
science
and
creation
and
their
meaning,
but
also
terms
about
mathematical
probability,
paleontology,
and
so
forth.
this
court
could
assume
that
all
of
the
state's
allegations
are
correct
on
those
factual
issues,
and
in
that
context,
could
interpret
the
legislative
history,
including
those
terms.
now,
the
appellees
are
also
arguing
that
the
social
context
is
relevant
to
a
determination
of
legislative
purpose.
we
do
disagree
with
that,
particularly
where
there
is
a
clear
legislative
history
and
where
there
is
a
clear
statute.
however,
addressing
the
social
context
involves
questions
of
history
which
similarly
are
factual
issues.
my
second
caveat
is,
if
this
court
were
to
apply
the
purpose
prong
of
the
tripartite
test,
ab
initio,
it
again
ought
to
determine
all
historical,
factual
type
questions
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
state,
just
as
it
should
the
definitional
questions.
in
that
sense,
it
might
be
possible
for
this
court
to
reach
a
purpose
determination
based
on
a
full
review
of
the
record.
i'd
urge
the
court
not
to
do
so.
because
certainly
for
effect
and
entanglement,
the
definitions
of
terms
are
highly
critical.
but
if
the
court
did
so,
i...
i
would
urge
this
court
to
give
the
kind
of
full
review
of
the
legislative
history
i
know
it
would.
we
have,
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
in
our
reply
brief,
footnotes
56a
to
56c,
cited
some
of
the
most
important
portions
of
the
legislative
history
on
the
purpose
to
advance
academic
freedom,
students
right
to
hear,
by
teaching
additional
scientific
information,
a
nonreligious
information.
it's
critical
that
the
legislative
history
be
read
in
context.
it's
also
critical
that
the
standard
applied
by
this
court,
at
all
times
in
the
past
for
purpose
review,
be
applied;
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
an
exclusively
secular
purpose;
but
instead,
it
is
sufficient
to
have
a
secular
purpose.
in
fact,
i
think
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
indicates
a
primary
secular
purpose,
although
the
state
does
recognize
that
there
are
tertiary
religious
purposes
indicated
in
the
record.
we
would
suggest
that
the
appellees
highly
selective--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--your
honor,
we'd
suggest
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
there
were
a
variety
of
reasons
for
this
act
being
passed.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
as
a
tertiary
purpose
only,
not
as
the
primary--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--or
even
the
secondary
purpose,
we'd
recognize
that,
doubtless,
some
legislators
had
a
desire
to
teach
religious
doctrine
in
the
classroom.
we
feel
that
was
a
small
minority
of
the
legislators,
as
indicated
by
the
record.
but
certainly
there's
no
question
that
in
this
mixture
of
many
different
purposes
that
would
certainly
be
a
tertiary
or
less
important
purpose,
along
with
basic
concepts
of
fairness;
the
academic
freedom
concern
of
students'
right
to
receive--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--no,
sir,
i
don't.
it
is
true
that
there
are--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--yes,
sir.
and
if
that
were
the
case,
i'd
suggest
that
the
courts
could
properly
address
any...
that
issue
if
they...
if
they
saw
that
issue
being
a
sufficiently
significant
purpose,
simply
by
stating
what
the
state
agrees
wholeheartedly
with,
that
the
teaching
of
the
bible,
as
part
of
implementing
this
statute,
would
be
unconstitutional.
the
state
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
that,
in
a
science
classroom,
would
not
be
appropriate
under
the
constitution
or
under
the
statute.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
your
honor,
not
in
this
case,
and
not
in
the
general
case.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
no.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
only
in
the
limited
context
this
court
has
recognized
in
shemp
and
other
decisions
of
an
objective,
neutral
discussions
of
a
wide
variety
of
religious
views.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
even
applicable
to
this
case.
the
state
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
to
teach
religious
doctrine
would
not
only
violate
the
establishment
clause
in
science
classes,
but
would
violate
the
terms
of
the
statute.
it's
critical,
as
many
of
the
questions,
i
believe,
reflect,
to
know
what
creation
science
is.
we--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--absolutely
not.
the
statute
itself
refers
to
scientific
evidence.
the
affidavits,
established
for
purposes
of
this
appeal,
that
creation
science
consists
of
scientific
evidence
and
scientific
interpretations.
the
state's
brandeis
memorandum,
in
fact,
cites
170
pages
of
that
scientific
evidence
in
defining
creation
science
and
its
content.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
your
honor,
teaching
creation
science
does
not
entail,
necessarily,
the
teaching
of
any
of
those
concepts.
in
other
words,
with
creation
science
consisting
of
scientific
evidence,
such
as
the
abrupt
appearance
of
complex
life
in
the
fossil
record,
the
systematic
gaps
between
fossil
categories,
the
mathematical
improbability
of
evolution,
the
vast
information
content
of
all
living
forms,
the
genetic
limits
of
viable
change...
in
none
of
that
is
there
any
concept
of
a
creator,
and
certainly
no
concept
of
genesis.
that
is
scientific
data.
as
you'll
find
summarized
in
the
joint
appendix
from
our
long
memorandum,
pages
g66
to
168,
356
to
87,
457
to
90.
in
fact,
the
term
"creation"
is
used
in
much
scientific
discussion
without
any
reference
to
a
creator.
the
big
bang
theory
is
often
described
as
a
theory
of
creation,
without
necessarily
having
any
concept
of
a
creator
embodied
in
it.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
it's
a
factual
issue.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
sir,
it
does.
and
it
depends
on
what
creation
science
means;
what
the
scientific
evidences
mean.
in
fact,
many
of
the--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
no,
your
honor,
not
under
the
narrow
exception
this
court
has
recognized
for
objective,
neutral,
discussion
of
religion.
however,
my
suggestion
was
simply
that
there's
no
need
to
bring
religion
into
this
subject
matter,
because--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--yes
sir.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
i'll
certainly
take
your
word
for
it.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
your
honor,
that's
not
before
the
court
in
this
case--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--but
certainly,
we
have
no
reason
to--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--my
answer
to
your
first
question
was
in
the
context
of
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized,
because
of
the
different
maturity
level,
the
different
critical
thinking
level
of
students
at
the
upper...
at
the
university
and
college
level,
that
a
far
broader
variety
of
courses
of
the
type
that
you've
just
described
would
be
generally
permissible
at
the
university
level.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
absolutely.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
absolutely.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
it
is.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
this
would
include
elementary
schools
to
the
extent
they're
teaching
anything
about
origins
today.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
charged
public
schools
with
keeping
impermissible
religious
material
out
of
the
classrooms
already.
and
in
terms
of
that
monitoring,
first,
you
mentioned
textbooks.
this
court
has
upheld--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--yes,
sir.
board
of
education
v.
allen,
mueller,
and
so
forth.
this
court,
in
the
regan
decision,
made
much
the
same
point
regarding
the
classroom
teaching,
particularly
when
we're
talking
about
a
public
school
teacher.
we
don't
have
any
issue,
as
in
cases
from
the
last
term--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--your
honor,
certainly
not.
because
this
court
does
assume
the
good
faith
of
teachers.
this
court
has
said
that
it
will
not
assume
bad
faith
of
teachers.
moreover,
any
religious
material
that
could
impermissibly
enter
the
science
classroom,
based
on
the
teaching
of
creation
science,
already
could
enter
that
classroom
based
on
the
teaching
of
evolution.
for
instance,
the
question,
who
created,
or
who
began,
the
evolutionary
process?
where
did
the
big
bang
come
from?
what
guided
the
evolutionary
process?
and
it's
to
be
presumed...
certainly
there's
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
in
this
case,
because
we
haven't
even
been
to
trial
yet...
that
teachers
will
not
do
that
which
is
impermissible.
if
they
do,
the
attorney
general
does
have
enforcement
authority
under
the
louisiana
constitution,
and
has
stated
his
intent
to
ensure
that
only
scientific
evidence
is
taught,
as
the
statute
refers
to,
and
not
that
any
impermissible
religious
material
is
taught,
particularly
genesis,
in
teaching
the
balanced
treatment.
that
would
be
impermissible.
the
definition
of
creation
science
is
critical.
and
even
opponents
of
creation
science
in
some
cases
have
acknowledge
that
creation
science
is
scientific
material;
not
religious
material.
for
instance,
one
of
the
affidavits
establishing
the
issue
for
purposes
of
summary
judgment
and
appeal,
said,
by
dr.
w.
scott
morrow,
i'm
not
a
creationist
or
a
religious
fundamentalist,
and
instead,
am
an
evolutionist
and
an
agnostic...
our
brief
at
page
19.
my
conclusions
are
that
creation
science
is
scientific,
nonreligious,
and
educationally
worthwhile.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
that
would
really
depend
on
their
own
categorization.
because
you
have
identified
an
issue
where
there
is
a
difference,
even
among
those
scientists--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--yes,
sir.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
there's
certainly
no
question
that
some
people
would
take
elements
of
what
the
statute
envisions
as
creation
science
and
combine
those
with
elements
of
evolution.
that's
their
right.
the
fact
that
two--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--your
honor,
we
cited
about
25
noncreationist
parties--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--who
do
view
them
as
mutually
exclusive.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
in
the
views
of
many
people--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--well,
your
honor,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
the
big
bang
theory
would
be
an
evolutionary
explanation
of
cosmic
evolution,
as
described
by
carl
sagan
and
others.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
probably
the
evolutionary
category,
though
some
people
would
differ.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
that
would
probably
be
categorized
as
an
evolutionist
view,
with
the
creationist
scientists
at
trial
anticipating
testimony
that
neanderthal
man
certainly
existed,
but
that
the
physical
evidence
is
that
it
was
simply
someone
comparable
to
modern
humans
with
bone
disease,
causing
a
bowing
of
the
bones.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
no,
your
honor.
our
expert
witnesses
include,
of
course,
some
evolutionists,
who
would
anticipate
testifying
at
trial,
along
the
lines
of
dr.
morrow,
who
i
quoted.
some
would
take
sort
of
an
intermediate
position,
saying
that
they're
either
not
sure
or--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--your
honor,
i
guess
my
point,
to
try
to
say
it
more
clearly,
is
that
many
evolutionists
do
recognize
creation
science
and
evolution
as
mutually
exclusive
on
each
issue,
as
a
logical
matter.
some
people
disagree.
that's
an
area
where
the
scientific
community
does
appear
to
disagree.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
your
honor,
we...
the
state
has
taken
the
position
consistently
that
creation
science
and
evolution
do
reflect
two
separate
positions--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--well,
if
you
define
evolution
as
being
macroevolutionary
change,
yes.
but
creation
scientists
recognize
the
occurrence
of
change;
microevolution,
without
any
question.
so
to
say
that
change
occurs
certainly
is
not
an
evolutionary
statement.
it's
a
statement
that
essentially
every
scientist
on
either
side
would
agree
to.
the
question
is
whether
evolution
occurred
from
one
or
a
few
simple
single-celled
living
forms,
through
fish,
amphibia,
reptiles,
primates,
and
so
forth.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
your
honor,
i
suppose
so.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
and
that's
an
area
of
disputed
fact.
scientists
disagree--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--he'd
certainly
be
taking
at
least
many
creationist
assumptions
and
interpretations
of
the
evidence,
yes.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
a
teacher
could
certainly
fall
in
both.
the
evidence
can
be
categorized
without
coercing
any
student
to
accept
only
one
or
the
other.
just
as
logical
matter,
the
universe
either
always
existed
or
came
into
being
abruptly,
the
first
life
either
came
into
being
abruptly
or
evolved
through
a
chemical
evolutionary
process.
the
various
living
forms,
the
basic
forms,
either
appeared
abruptly
or
evolved
from
simple
to
complex.
in
that
sense,
they're
logical
alternatives.
but
people
certainly
have
the
right,
which
louisiana
schools
ought
to
respect,
to
accept
elements
of
both.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
i'm
afraid
i
didn't
hear
the
end
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
absolutely.
and
i
guess
the
basic
point--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--well,
many
people
do
combine
elements
of
both,
and
in
that
sense,
fit
your
categorization.
i
guess
the
point
is
that
the
louisiana
legislature
determined
that
students
were
not
receiving
all
of
the
scientific
information
on
the
subject.
they
were
receiving,
in
general,
only
that
which
supported
evolution;
and
that
those
students
were
entitled
to
receive
additional
scientific
information,
however
those
students
chose
to
categorize.
that's
the
issue
in
this
case,
when
we
get
into
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
i'm
sure
it
won't
be
lower,
but
i'll
be
very
happy
to--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--try
addressing
it.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
your
honor,
i'm
not...
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
pardon
me?
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
sir.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
no,
it
does
not.
it
address
only
public
schools,
much
like
most
of
the
other
16
louisiana
statutes
prescribing
courses
of
study.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
in
that,
different
standards
for
private
schools
is
something
that
is
widely
practiced
and
certainly
is
constitutional
justification.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
if
they
could
afford
to,
yes,
sir.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
procedural
issue,
the
state
submits,
should
be
decisive
in
this
case.
and
mr.
topkis
has
done
a
very
nice
job
of
demonstrating
the
factual
disputes
between
the
parties,
disputes
that
ought
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
evidence
at
a
trial.
it
would
simply
subvert
the
purposes
of
the
summary
judgment
rules
to
allow
a
court
to
take
a
leap
of
faith
over
the
issue
at
hand
to
apply
the
tripartite
test
to
an
unknown
subject.
if
this
court
chooses
to
rely
on
constitutional
grounds,
however,
there's
a
great
deal
of
argument
in
support
of
the
state's
position
that,
we
submit,
should
lead
to
a
favorable
conclusion:
not
only
the
engel
line
of
cases;
not
only
the
historical
evidence;
but
the
tripartite
test
itself
shows
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute.
the
purpose
was
stated
as
to
advance
academic
freedom.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
if
they
were
within
the
same
subject
area,
such
as
conversational
german
versus
formal
german--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--well,
of
course,
that's
not
the
wording
of
this
statute.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
it
is
a
balanced
treatment
statute.
but--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--your
honor,
if
the
assumption
of
the
legislature
there,
as
here,
was
that
most
or
nearly
all
teachers
would
opt
for
teaching
both--
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
--yes,
it
would.
mr.
wendell
r.
bird
yes,
it
would,
if
you
recognize
that
a
legislature
may
not
use
the
terms
"academic
freedom"
in
the
correct
legal
sense.
they
might
have
in
mind,
instead,
a
basic
concept
of
fairness;
teaching
all
of
the
evidence.
thank
you.
