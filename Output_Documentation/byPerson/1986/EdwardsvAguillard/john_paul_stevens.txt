justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
they
just
said
the
case
should
be
reheard
en
banc.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bird,
what
would
you
say
was
the
factual
issue
that
had
to
be
resolved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
the
statute
defines
the
term
adequately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
factual
issue
was,
what
does...
what
does
the
statutory
term
mean,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
these
people,
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
enacting
the
statute,
are
able
to
tell
us
what
the
statute
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
those
religious
that
you
acknowledge
are
indicated
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
just
asked
you
what
were
the
religious
purposes
that
are...
that
you
acknowledge
are
present.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there
was
also
a
purpose...
do
you
think
there
was
also
a
purpose
to
exclude
the
teaching
of
evolutionary
science,
or
whatever
you
might
call
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
to
the
extent
that
there's
a
religious
purpose,
it's
to
add
to
the
curriculum,
rather
than
to
subtract
from
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bird,
can
i
ask
you,
you
gave
an
example
a
moment
ago
of
a
big
bang
theory
to
mention
the
evolutionary
process.
supposing
there
was
a
big
bang
a
million
years
ago
that
created
much
of
what
we
know
on
the
earth,
but...
everything
except
man.
and
then
after
that,
there
was
evolution
to
what
we
now
know
as
man.
would
a
person
who
believed
that
be
a
evolutionist
or
a
creation
scientist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
some
people
might
be
a
creationist
within
your
definition
at
a
certain
point,
but
then
believe
that
evolution
followed
that
beginning
moment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
just
wondering
how
you
classify
that
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you...
do
you
think
there's...
they
are
two
mutually
exclusive
categories?
or
could
a
person
be
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'd
rather
not
refer--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
view
them
as
mutually
exclusive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
can
you
tell
me,
then,
which
category
my
example
falls
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can
you
tell
me
which
theory...
which
category
my
example
falls
under?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the...
what
if
i
included,
say,
neanderthal,
and
then...
but
say
that
it
was
a
lower
form
of
life
than
present
man?
would
it
still
be...
then
would
that
be
a
creationist
or
an
evolutionist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
of
your
examples
of
people
who
are
creation
scientists
would
deny
any
evolutionary
process
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
can
they...
if
they're
mutually
exclusive
categories,
how
can
there
be
an
intermediate
position?
and
if
there
can't
be,
i
really
don't
quite
understand
what
the
dividing
line
between
the
two
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
do
you
have
a
position?
do
the
people
supporting
this
legislation
say
it
draws
such
a
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mutually
exclusive
positions,
and
if
there's
any
evolution
at
all,
then
you're
in
the
evolutionary
category?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that's
the
test,
your
answer
to
my
question
is
easy.
the
example
that
i
gave
is
that
you're
a
creationist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
there's
a
very
definite
process
of
evolution
from
the
neanderthal
man
to
the
present
society.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
mean,
even
if
one
believed
that,
he
would
still
be
a
creationist
under
your
definition,
because
he
doesn't
believe
everything
started
from
an
amoeba,
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
see,
the
difficulty
i
have
is
when
you
talk
about
many
and
some
is,
i'm
trying
to
decide
whether
they
are
mutually
exclusive
categories
or
not,
and
whether
teachers
who
have
to
administer
this
act
fall
in
one
camp
or
the
other,
or
could
they
fall
in
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
possible
that
some
of
the
appeared
abruptly,
and
others
evolved
from
what
first
appeared
abruptly?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say,
is
it
not
possible
that
some
forms
of
life
appeared
abruptly,
and
others
evolved
from
those
that
did
appear
abruptly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that's
true,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
avoid
the
possibility
that
a
person
could
be
both
an
evolutionist
and
a
creation
scientist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
topkis,
we
have
a
doctrine
called
the
pullman
doctrine,
which
is
succinctly
described
as
follows:
no
principle
has
found
more
consistent
or
clear
expression
than
that
the
federal
courts
should
not
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
state
enactments
fairly
open
to
interpretation
until
the
state
courts
have
been
afforded
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
pass
upon
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
does...
do
we
have
any
idea
what
louisiana
courts
thinks
this
phrase,
creation,
means
in
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
topkis,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
when
the
case
was
referred
on
the
state
constitutional
issue
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
i
believe
you
were
involved
in
the
litigation
at
that
point.
was
the
louisiana
supreme
court
asked
by
either
party
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
definition
of
creation
science?
i
know
the
court
did
not
do
it,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
there's
no
request
by
either
party
for
abstention
to
have
the
state
court
advise
the
parties
on
the
meaning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
topkis,
let
me
just
be
sure:
is
there
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
supporting
the...
this
academic
freedom
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
or
at
least
there
is
something
in
the
legislative
history
that
some
were
motivated
by
a
desire
to
counteract
the
evolutionary
subject
with
teaching
of
another
subject
that
would
have
a
different
message.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
you
say
that's
not
academic
freedom.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
maybe
you're
right.
but
at
least
when
they
make
that
argument,
there
is
something
in
the
history
that
provides
a
basis
for
it.
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--academic
freedom
for
a
moment?
would
you
say
it
would
advance
academic
freedom
if
the
school
was
told
you
cannot
teach
a
german...
a
student
the
german
language
unless
he's
also
willing
to
study
french?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
just
german...
they
didn't
particularly
like
germans
and
they
do
like
french.
so
what
they
say
to
the
student
is,
you
can't
study
german
unless
you
study
french.
would
that
advance
academic
freedom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
pretty
close.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can't
teach
evolution
unless
you
teach
this
other
subject.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
asking,
would
it
advance
academic
freedom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they'd
come
in
and
say,
we
did
it
to
advance
academic
freedom.
would
you
accept
that
rationale?
