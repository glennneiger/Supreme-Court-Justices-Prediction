mr.
jay
topkis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please:
mr.
bird
was
complaining
at
some
length
about
how
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
the
legislative
history.
i'm
perfectly
content
to
discuss
the
legislative
history,
but
i'd
like
to
take
as
my
starting
point
justice
frankfurter's
dictum
that
when
there's
some
uncertainty
about
the
legislative
history,
it's
not
forbidden
to
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
[laughter]
what's
all
this
talk
about
technical
terms?
these
are
not
polysyllabic
scientific
words
beginning
with
polymicro-something-or-another.
these
are
words
that
we've
all
heard
since
we
were
kids.
creation.
creation...
that's
a
word
we're
all
familiar
with.
let
me
just
go
to
the
dictionary
quickly.
webster's
third
international.
mr.
jay
topkis
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
jay
topkis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
topkis
yes.
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
your
honor,
this
litigation
was
brought
in
the
federal
court.
and
because
that's
the
court
to
which
citizens
traditionally
look
for
protection
of
their
constitutional
liberties.
but
going
directly
to
your
question,
dr.
morrow
comes
along,
years
after
the
statute
is
enacted,
and
says
that
to
him,
creation
science
means
these
buzzwords.
and
those
buzzwords
come
right
out
of
mr.
bird's
lexicon.
he's
been
using
them
for
years.
they're
his.
the
louisiana
legislature
never
heard
anything
about
abrupt,
relatively
sudden,
or
abrupt
appearance
in
complex
form,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
mr.
jay
topkis
i
am.
i'm
talking
about
what
the
word
"creation"
means,
according
to
webster.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
in
all
likelihood
the
louisiana
legislature
dealt
with.
and
what
the
word
means,
according
to
webster,
is,
the
act
of
bringing
into
existence,
from
nothing,
the
universe
or
the
world
or
the
living
and
nonliving
things
in
it.
now,
the
statute,
of
course,
also
uses
the
term
"creationism".
and
webster
defines
that,
too:
a
doctrine
or
theory
of
creation
holding
that
matter,
the
various
forms
of
life
and
the
world
were
created
by
a
transcendent
god
out
of
nothing.
that's
what
webster's
third,
published
in
1981,
the
year
this
statute
was
adopted,
gave
as
the
definitions
of
these
two
key
words.
now,
maybe
that
was
a
little
ahead
of
its
time.
let's
go
to
webster's
second.
no
great
difference.
webster's
second,
published
in
'34,
defines
"creation":
the
act
of
creating
or
the
fact
of
being
created;
specifically,
the
act
of
causing
to
exist
or
the
fact
of
being
brought
into
existence
by
divine
power,
or
its
equivalent.
creationism--
mr.
jay
topkis
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
topkis
no,
but--
mr.
jay
topkis
--acquinas
had
a
somewhat
similar
view.
mr.
jay
topkis
of
course
not.
mr.
jay
topkis
right.
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
believe
in
creation?
not
when
creation
means
creation
by
a
divine
creator.
that's
the
test.
and
the
louisiana--
mr.
jay
topkis
--divine,
your
honor,
has
connotations
beyond,
i
respectfully
submit.
mr.
jay
topkis
no.
mr.
jay
topkis
but
when
you
look
to
see
what
"creation"
means,
it
means
"divine".
and,
i
go
further,
if
i
may,
the
louisiana
legislature
has
been
perfectly
clear
on
what
words
mean
in
louisiana.
the
louisiana
civil
code,
article
xiv,
says
that
the
words
of
a
law
are
generally
to
be
understood
in
their
most
usual
significance,
without
attending
so
much
to
the
nicety...
niceties
of
grammar
rules
as
to
the
general
and
popular
use
of
the
words.
mr.
jay
topkis
it
is
the
louisiana
legislature,
your
honor,
which
writes
statutes,
employing
the
common
parlance--
mr.
jay
topkis
--and
which,
when
courts
are
called
on
to
interpret
those
statutes,
courts,
whether
state,
federal
or
whatever,
are
obligated
to
follow
and
interpret
those
statutes
in
the
light
of
the
meaning
of
the
louisiana
legislature.
mr.
jay
topkis
quite
so,
your
honor.
i'm
familiar
with
that.
mr.
jay
topkis
we
have
only
the
very
brief
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
to
the
effect
that
this
statute
does
not
offend
the
louisiana
constitution.
that's
all
we've
got.
mr.
jay
topkis
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
i
thought,
as
i
read
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
that
they
said,
everybody
knows
what
creation
and
creationism
is.
it's
a
basically
fundamentalist
point
of
view.
and
i
would
not
think
that
we
would
have
much
uncertainty
about
it,
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
people
whose
objectives
are
plain
seek
to
invoke
familiar--
mr.
jay
topkis
--that
the
statute
might
be...?
mr.
jay
topkis
i
would
not
regard
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
as
a
necessarily
religious
doctrine.
i
would
think
of
it
as
a
proposition
in
morality.
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
there
are
lots
of
propositions
that
are
subscribed
to
by
religious
faiths,
but
they
do
not
become
religious,
as
i
understand,
merely
by
virtue
of
that
subscription.
for
example,
most
religions
forbid
or
speak
against
homicide.
but
a
civil...
pardon
me,
a
criminal
statute
making
homicide
criminal
is
not
a
religious
statute.
mr.
jay
topkis
even
though.
now--
mr.
jay
topkis
--i
do
not
believe
so,
and
my
colleague
assures
me
that
that's
his
recollection,
also.
mr.
jay
topkis
neither
the
parties
nor
the
fifth
circuit;
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
topkis
justice
scalia.
mr.
jay
topkis
i
wouldn't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the
principal
wouldn't
be
acting
out
of
religious
motivation.
he
would
be
acting
out
of
the
scholar's
interest
in
truth.
and
when
for
whatever
reason
factual
error
was
called
to
his
attention,
he
would
do
his
best
to
correct
it.
mr.
jay
topkis
by
every
index
that
we
can
possibly
have,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
jay
topkis
we
take
a
look
at
the
vocabulary
of
the
statute;
it
is
religious.
we
take
a
look
at
what
the
legislators
said
at
the
time
they
acted;
it
is
nothing
but
religious.
we
can
go
through
this
entire
record
without
finding
anybody
talking
about
a
secular
purpose.
they
talk
about
how
terrible
evolution
is.
why?
because
it's
godless
evolution,
and
what
we
got
to
do
is
bring
god
into
balance
with
evolution.
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
again,
i'm
following
your
hypothetical,
and
i
think
that
the...
are
you
still
assuming
that
it
is
the
superintendent
who
makes
the
decision?
because
i'm
responding
to
you
that
he
makes
it
out
of
his
quest
for
truth.
mr.
jay
topkis
yes?
he's
directed
by
the
school
board,
and
they
are
motivated...
but
nonetheless,
what
they
are
doing
is
not
teaching
religion.
they
are
teaching
history
out
of
a
religious
motive.
mr.
jay
topkis
quite
so.
mr.
jay
topkis
all
right.
now,
i
said
before
that
this
definition
that
mr.
bird
is
so
fond
of,
and
i
quote
it...
origin
through
abrupt
appearance
in
complex
form
of
biological
life,
life
itself,
and
the
physical
universe...
one
thing
we
know
about
that
collection
of
words
is
that
it
has
never
before
been
seen
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
except
in
mr.
bird's
briefs,
and
the
affidavits
prepared.
mr.
bird
is
a
little
slender
to
play
tweedledum,
but
that's
what
he's
trying
to
do.
he
wants
words
to
mean
what
he
says
they
mean.
and
that
didn't
fool
alice,
and
i
doubt
very
much
that
it
will
fool
this
court.
mr.
jay
topkis
your
honors,
i'd
like
now
to
go
to
another
of
mr.
bird's
buzzwords,
academic
freedom.
the
idea
of
academic
freedom
that
is
advanced
here
is,
again,
unlike
any
previous
notion
of
that
term.
it's
not
a
term;
it's
an
incantation,
as
he
uses
it.
this
statute
calls
for
the
very
antithesis
of
academic
freedom.
it
says
that
the
teacher
must
give
balanced
treatment,
regardless
of
whether
the
evidence
is
balanced.
it
says
the
teacher
may
teach
evolution
only
at
the
price
of
teaching
what
he
or
she
knows
to
be
pseudoscience.
and
the
teacher
may
teach
only
the
evidences
for
creation;
none
against.
i
can't
imagine
anything
farther
from
the
idea
of
academic
freedom.
mr.
jay
topkis
yes
and
no,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
yes
in
the
sense
that
most
elementary
school
teachers
are
autocrats.
i
can
remember
my
own
miss
bremner
very
well.
and
but
i
think
that
the
teacher
is
pretty
free
to
teach
what
the
teacher
believes
to
be
truth,
even
in
elementary
schools.
mr.
jay
topkis
i...
i
think
that's--
mr.
jay
topkis
--well--
mr.
jay
topkis
--well,
academic
freedom
is
not
incompatible
with
supervision,
i
think,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
jay
topkis
i
don't
think
i
do,
no.
mr.
jay
topkis
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
jay
topkis
yes?
mr.
jay
topkis
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
topkis
quite
so.
mr.
jay
topkis
i
see
it's
relevance,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
powell,
only
in
the
sense
that
this
statute
is
defended
as
advancing
academic
freedom.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
give
explicit
commands...
teach
equally,
teach
for...
you
are
not
talking
about
academic
freedom.
that's
the
entirety
of
my
contention
on
the
point.
mr.
jay
topkis
could
be.
mr.
jay
topkis
so
long
as
the
purpose
of
the
school
authorities,
in
taking
this
position,
was
an
historical
purpose
rather
than
a
religious
one,
i
couldn't
quarrel
with
it.
mr.
jay
topkis
no.
no,
it
wouldn't
vindicate
academic
freedom.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
would
think
that
only...
no,
pardon
me.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
a
requisite
of
a
teacher
who
professed
to
be
indulging
in
or
utilizing
his
academic
freedom
to
give
fair
treatment
to
the
history
of
both...
i
forget
your
honor's
example...
the
reformation
and
the
counter-reformation,
or
whatever.
to
pull
somebody
up
who
is,
out
of
his
own
personal
prejudices...
or
views;
i'll
not
use
the
perjorative...
overstressing
one
side
of
a
controversy,
or
one
aspect
of
history,
is
not
to
deprive
him
of
academic
freedom.
academic
freedom
does
not
mean
the
right
to
teach
exclusively
one
particular
view,
as
i
see
it,
at
any
rate.
i
take
it...
i
had
planned
to
discuss
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
a
little
bit,
but
i
rather
imagine
that
my
time
is
running
on.
i
think
that
i'll
just
rest
with
this
statement.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
speaks
of
a
secular
purpose:
no
sponsor
of
the
legislature...
of
the
legislation;
no
witness;
nobody.
the
one
witness
i
love
is
a
ms.
pabbs
minhinit,
who
said:
i
think
if
you
teach
children
that
they
are
evolved
from
apes,
then
they
will
start
acting
like
apes.
if
we
teach
them
possibly
that
they
were
created
by
an
almighty
god,
then
they
will
believe
that
they
were
a
creature
of
god
and
start
acting
like
one
of
god's
children.
that's
what
she
told
the
senate
before
the
senate
voted.
now,
i
don't,
of
course,
take
issue--
mr.
jay
topkis
--oh,
sure,
your
honor.
academic
freedom.
we
got
to
give
god
equal
time.
that's
their
idea
of
academic
freedom.
mr.
jay
topkis
but
not,
your
honor...
academic
freedom
does
not--
mr.
jay
topkis
--that's
right.
mr.
jay
topkis
yes,
and
what
they
want
to
do
is
see
to
it
that
their
version
of
religion...
they
start
with
the
premise
that
evolution
is
religious.
it's
secular
humanism.
it's
godless.
and
what
they
want
to
do
is
counter
this
religion...
and
they
repeatedly
call
evolution
a
religion...
and
they
say,
let's
give
equal
time
to
the
other
religion.
well,
that's
not
academic
freedom.
now--
mr.
jay
topkis
--justice
scalia.
mr.
jay
topkis
right.
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
your
honor,
when
we
try
to
figure
out
what
the
legislature
meant,
we
look
first
at
its
plain
words;
then
at
the
words
of
the
sponsors
and
so
on;
and
then
we
listen,
or
we
look,
for
anything
else.
there
isn't
a
single
word
in
this
history
of
secular
interest.
mr.
bird
and
we,
at
an
earlier
stage,
in
a
parallel
litigation,
the
record
of
which
is
part
of
this
record,
took
40
depositions;
there's
not
a
word
in
those
depositions,
mr.
bird
hasn't
brought
one
forward,
about
secular
purpose.
mr.
jay
topkis
not,
your
honor,
with
respect,
when
the
complaint
is,
they're
teaching
that
religion.
why
don't
they
teach
my
religion?
and
that's
what
the
legislature
said.
and
that's
what
the
witnesses
said.
over
and
over
again.
there's
nobody
coming
forward
and
taking
any
other
position.
now,
this
bill
was
of
course
drafted
by
a
theologian,
or
somebody
versed
in
apologetics.
there's
an
amusing
bit
of
evidence
on
that
subject
in
the
very
language
of
the
bill.
the
bill
keeps
using...
the
act
keeps
using
the
term
"evidences"
in
the
plural.
we
lawyers
never
speak
of
"evidences"
in
the
plural.
we
speak
of
"evidence",
the
singular.
and
i
got
nagged
by
it,
and
i
looked
it
up
the
other
day.
and
of
course
the
only
dictionary
reference
to
"evidences"
is
to
christian
apologetics:
the
evidences
for
christianity.
this
is
a
matter
of
theological
disputation.
and
going
back
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
scalia,
there
wasn't
offered
here
any
affidavit
from
senator
keith,
or
any
other
legislator,
about
what
their
purpose
was.
they
were
apparently
content,
or
stuck,
with
their
record.
now,
again,
where
does
this
come
from?
let
me
note
one
unusual
fact
about
one
of
those
five
affidavits
that
mr.
bird
came
up
with.
he
offers
an
affidavit
by
a
dr.
terry
meith,
who
tells
us
that
he's
a
philosopher
and
a
theologian,
and
that
he
possesses
three
graduate
degrees,
two
doctorates
and
a
master's.
he
even
tells
us
what
grade
point
averages
he
got
at
two
of
the
schools.
he
got
a
3.94
at
one
school,
and
a
3.97
at
another
school.
i've
never
seen
an
expert
qualified
precisely
that
way.
they
usually
settle
for
saying,
i
was
phi
beta
kappa.
but
okay,
he
says
3.94
and
3.97
at
two
schools.
he
omits
usc.
well,
i
don't
attribute
any
significance
to
that.
usc
i
have
heard
is
a
rather
difficult
school,
and
may
be
he
didn't
do
so
well
there.
i'm
not
going
to
fault
him
for
that.
but
the
omission
i
do
find
significant
is
in
his
employment
record.
he
signed
the
affidavit
in
september
1984.
and
he
does
not
state
where
he
was
then
employed.
all
of
the
other
affidavits
that
mr.
bird
submits
do
give
that
information.
and
we
found
the
explanation
yesterday.
the
affidavit's
jurat
reads:
lynchburg,
virginia.
and
just
on
a
hunch,
my
colleague,
mr.
harper,
called
liberty
university
where
reverend
jerry
falwell
is
the
chancellor.
and
wouldn't
you
know
it,
we
got
right
through
to
dr.
meith.
he's
been
on
that
faculty
since
1984.
and
apparently,
was
not
very
interested
in
this
case,
which
deals
so
much
with
fundamentalist,
with
acknowledging
where
he
was
employed.
i--
mr.
jay
topkis
--one
of
them
so
stated,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
topkis
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
question.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
topkis
right.
mr.
jay
topkis
right.
mr.
jay
topkis
right.
mr.
jay
topkis
yes?
mr.
jay
topkis
i
don't
care
about
their
purpose;
as
long
as
what
they
do
is
get
the
true
historical
facts
taught,
i'm
not
going
to
be
terribly
concerned.
mr.
jay
topkis
exactly,
exactly.
now--
mr.
jay
topkis
--justice
powell.
mr.
jay
topkis
i
shouldn't
think
so,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
topkis
no,
not
a
bit.
mr.
jay
topkis
i
studied
the
bible...
well,
i
didn't
go
to
a
state
university.
but
of
course
there's
nothing
inappropriate
about
teaching
the
bible,
or
teaching
spincza's
demonstration
of
the
existence
of
god
by
mathematical
principles.
mr.
jay
topkis
i'm
sorry?
mr.
jay
topkis
i
don't
see
anything--
mr.
jay
topkis
--absolutely,
as
long
as
it
is
taught
in
neutral
fashion;
as
long
as
the
state
does
not
say,
as
long
as
no
professor
comes
into
class,
and
announces:
ladies
and
gentlemen,
today
i'm
going
to
prove
to
you
that
the
bible
is
right.
mr.
jay
topkis
i
would...
i
have
no
objection
to
courses
on
the
bible.
when
they
are
taught
from
a
pro-bible
perspective,
i
would
think
that
constitutionally
they
ought
to
be
left
to
notre
dame,
southern
methodist,
and
other
institutions
of
proclaimed
orientation.
mr.
jay
topkis
not
in
public
universities;
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
topkis
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
