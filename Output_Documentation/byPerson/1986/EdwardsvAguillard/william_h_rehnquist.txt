chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-1513,
edwards
against
aguillard.
mr.
bird,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bird,
i
understood
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit,
from
which
you're
appealing,
to
say
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
had
no
secular
purpose,
and
it
failed
that
part
of
the
so-called
lemon
test.
is
it
really
necessary
to
get
into
all
this
meaning
of
technical
terms
in
order
to
review
that
what
seems
to
be
a
rather
narrow
ruling
of
the
fifth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bird.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
topkis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
topkis,
you're
arguing
here
in
support
of
the
fifth
circuit,
not
only
the
judgment
but
the
rationality,
i
take
it,
that
there
is
no
secular
purpose
for
this
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
didn't
understand
the
fifth
circuit
to
rely
as
heavily
as
you
apparently
do
on
dictionary
definitions
of
the
terms
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
part
of
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
could
be
read
as
saying
that
if
there
was...
if
the
statute
was
passed
for
religious
purposes,
say,
fairly
broadly
interpreted
like,
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself,
or
something,
that
the
statute
might
be
bad.
you
wouldn't
go
that
far,
would
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
the
statute
might
be
unconstitutional
as
being
an
establishment
of
religion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
it's
a
morality
subscribed
to
by
many
religious
faiths.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though,
perhaps,
a
number
of
church
people
go
down
and
say,
we
want
this
statute
passed
because
it's
consistent
with
our
religious
belief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
overestimate
us.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
had
a
statute,
mr.
topkis,
that
said,
we
think
an
awful
lot
of
teachers
in
the
school
system
in
this
state
have
presented
only
the
protestant
view
of
the
reformation
in
their
medieval
history
classes,
and
so
we
want
to
give
equal
time
to
the
catholic
view?
do
you
think
that
that
would...
suppose
it
was
passed
with
a
purely...
interest
in
historical
truth...
do
you
think
that
would
raise
any
problems?
perhaps
even
though
a
lot
of
protestant
religious
people
got
behind
it,
or
a
lot
of
catholic
religious
people
got
behind
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
certainly
wouldn't
vindicate
academic
freedom,
in
the
normal
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
topkis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bird,
do
you
have
any
more?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bird.
the
case
is
submitted.
