well,
mr.
bird,
if
we
were
to
do
that
here,
wouldn't
we
just
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
the
stated
purpose
of
the
legislature
in
making
that
determination?
why
would
we
have
to
perpetuate
the
alleged
error
you
think
was
made
below?
why
couldn't
we
look
at
the
record
here
and
determine
whether
the
court
was
correct
in
its
decision
on
the
purpose
prong
of
the
lemon
test?

mr.
bird,
do
you
think
that
it
is
constitutional
within
the
establishment
clause
to
teach
a
purely
religious
concept
in
public
school
in
order
to
balance
other
concepts
that
are
perceived
to
be
anti-religious?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
general,
i
asked.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
general.
is
that...
is
that
valid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
