justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
me
ask
you
a
question
there--
--may
i
interrupt
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
have
a
course
in
the
louisiana
schools
or
colleges
on
religion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
but
i
think
it's
helpful,
at
least
to
me,
to
know
what
actually
is
being
done
in
louisiana.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
louisiana
state,
i
looked
at
the
catalogue,
as
i
count
has
seven
courses
on
religion.
every
other
state
college
or
university...
do
you
want
to
know
what
the
courses
are?
well,
i
won't
take
the
time--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--they
have
a
course
called,
introduction
to
religion.
they
have
a
course
on
the
old
testament.
they
have
a
course
on
the
new
testament.
they
have
one
on
faith
and
doubt.
jesus
in
history
and
tradition.
eastern
religions.
philosophy
of
religion.
and
so
on.
i
would
guess
that
most
of
the
universities
in
the
united
states
have
similar
courses.
they're
all
right,
aren't
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what...
what
your
position
really
is.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
of
course
at
the
university
level
they
also
have
biology
courses--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--that
no
doubt
go
into
evolution.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
saying
that
all
we
have
before
us
today
is
what
happens
at
the
public
school
level?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
about
elementary
school?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
curious,
or
so
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
statute
is
very
explicit
in
requiring
that,
with
respect
to
everything
that
goes
on
in
the
classroom,
in
the
textbooks,
in
the
libraries,
and
in
all
instructional
matters,
that
this
statute
has
to
be
complied
with.
how
in
the
world
can
that
be
monitored?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
can
monitor
a
textbook.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
have
to
have
monitors
in
every
classroom?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
bird?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
we
come
to
a
lower
level
of
discourse,
and
not
talk
about
philosophy.
[laughter]
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
it'll
be
a
lot
lower.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
private
schools
in
louisiana,
don't
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
some
religious
and
some
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
your
state
board
of
education
have
to
certify
those
schools?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
do
in
virginia.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
do
in
my
state
of
virginia,
and
i
think
in
22
of
the
states
they
do.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
what
means
is
that
a
minimum
course
of
study
is
prescribed;
otherwise
you
don't
have
a
certificate,
and
graduates
are
unable
to
get
in
good
colleges.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
i'm
leading
up
to
ask
you
is,
does
this
statute
apply
to
those
schools?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
if
pupils
didn't
like
these
course,
they
could
go
into
private
schools
or
parochial
schools?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
they
could
afford
to
go?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'd
like
to
follow
up
on
that
a
little
bit.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
think
about
the
high
school
level.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
as
i
think
we've
mentioned
before,
the
courses
are
prescribed
by
the
state
board
of
education.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
teachers
are
not
free,
absent
permission,
to
teach
different
courses.
and
the
state
board
of
education
also
selects
the
textbooks.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
may
give
the
local
school
board
a
choice
between
two
or
three.
i
agree
with
you
that
once
you
get
into
the
classroom...
and
that'll
be
true
under
this
statute...
the
teacher
is
going
teach
whatever
she
or
he
really
thinks,
despite
what
may
be
written
in
a
textbook.
but
the
point
i'm
making
is,
it
seems
to
me
your
academic
freedom
argument
would
be
well
directed
at
the
college
level.
but
i
question,
really,
whether
it's
relevant,
particularly,
as
justice
marshall
indicates,
at
the
public
school
level.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
perhaps
it
would
be
irrelevant
to
both
arguments,
both
sides?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
topkis,
i
just
want
to
ask
one
quick
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
view
the
teaching
of
religious
courses
at
the
college
level...
state
colleges,
state
universities...
differently
from
the
position
that
you
take
here
today?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
would
think
a
constitutional
question
were
raised
if
a
university
taught
a
course
on
the
bible?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
do
you
think?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
0
xxx.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
didn't
understand
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
appropriate
for
a
state
university
to
teach
biblical
courses,
to
teach
a
course
on
the
bible?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if...
if
the
university
has
courses
in
biology
and
chemistry
and
teaches
specifically
courses
in
evolution,
would
you
object
to
courses
on
the
bible?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
not
in
public
universities?
