unknown

mr.
dershowitz,
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence,
but
you
read
from
page
345
of
the
opinion
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
take
a
look
at
346,
and
i'll
direct
your
attention
to
some
language
that
may
be
relevant
to
the
question
of
intent.
unknown
speaker
three
forty
six,
the
carryover
paragraph.
start
with
the
sentence
beginning
with:
thus--
unknown
speaker
--petitioner
could
anticipate
the
use
of
lethal
force
during
this
attempt
to
flee
the
confinement;
in
fact,
he
later
said
that
during
the
escape
he
would
have
been
willing
personally
to
kill
in
a
"very
close
life
or
death
situation.
"
and
that
he
recognized
that
after
the
escape
there
was
a
possibility
of
killing.
and
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
paragraph:
from
these
facts...
and
a
number
of
others
are
stated
on
that
page...
we
conclude
that
petitioner
intended
to
kill.
petitioner
participated
up
to
the
moment
of
the
firing
of
the
final
shots...
the
fatal
shots...
were
substantially
the
same
as
that
of
gary
tison
and
greenawalt.
unknown
speaker
did
the
young
men
carry
guns
throughout
the
whole
escape?
unknown
speaker
didn't
they
participate
in
stopping
the
automobile?
unknown
speaker
they
had
the
guns
with
them?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
which
one
was
raymond
tison?
unknown
speaker
you're
arguing
your
first
point?
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
before
you
leave
the
first
point--
unknown
speaker
--i
take
it
you
do
subscribe
to
the
statement
on
page
345
as
the
correct
test
under
enmund:
intend
to
kill
includes
the
situation
in
which
the
defendant
intended,
contemplated,
or
anticipated
that
lethal
force
would
or
might
be
use,
or
that
life
would
or
might
be
taken;
that's
sufficient
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
that
definition
is
broad
enough
to
include
any
felony
murder?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
why
did
the
boys
go
to
get
the
water?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
were
going
to
shoot
a
man,
would
you
go
get
him
a
drink
of
water?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
speculate
on
a
man's
life?
can
you?
please,
don't
ask
me.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
he
did
that
to
keep
him
from
dying
of
thirst.
that's
what
he
said.
unknown
speaker
he
said
he
got...
he
went
to
keep
him
from
dying.
unknown
speaker
but
he
went
to
get
him
water
in
order
to
kill
him.
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
raymond.
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
see
the
shots;
he
heard
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
heard
it
and
saw
a
flash,
which
meant
he
wasn't
there.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schafter,
if
i
understand
your
view
of
the
case,
the
result
would
still
be
the
same
even
if
they'd
been
five
miles
away
at
the
time
of
the
actual
killing,
because
all
the
preceding
events
would
have
clearly
satisfied
the
test?
unknown
speaker
no,
they
couldn't.
but
i
mean,
they
really
didn't
have
to
be
in
the
immediate
vicinity
at
the
time
the
killing
took
place,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
but
supposing
right
after
they
stopped
the
car
with
the
family
in
it,
the
two
boys
instead
of
following
along
as
they
did,
had
just
gone
on
a
hike,
walked
away
half
a
mile,
and
then
the
father
and
the
older
brother,
killed
the
family?
unknown
speaker
but
would
the
death
penalty
be
permissible
on
those
facts,
given
the
history
of
this
crime?
i'm
trying
to
find
out
whether
you
think
their
presence
at
the
scene
is
of
constitutional
importance
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
should
have
phrased
it
different.
was
it
essential?
or
is
it
merely
a
matter
of
foreseeability?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
it
satisfy
it
in
this
particular
case
if
the
two
younger
boys,
right
after
stopping
the
car
and
driving
it
wherever
they...
down
to
the
end
of
the
road
or
wherever
they
were...
they
just
walked
away,
and
were
maybe
a
mile
away
at
the
time
the
father
shot
the
people?
unknown
speaker
does
it
add,
because
you
think
it
increases
the
likelihood
that
they
actually
intended
that
the
father
would
do
the
killing?
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
seem
to
be
suggesting
that
some
degree
of
actual
intent
to
have
a
killing
occur
is
part
of
the
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
what
would
your
view
be
if
we
could
know
the
facts,
and
of
course
we
can
never
be
sure
in
a
case
like
this,
if
you
could
accept
the
fact
that
they
were
genuinely
surprised
by
the
fact
that
the
father
actually
killed
these
people?
would
you
still
come
to
the
same
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
the...
what
would
your
view
be
if
you
could
accept
that
fact
hypothetically?
unknown
speaker
would
or
might
be
used.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
one
other
question.
do
you
think
the
record
tells
us
whether
the
arizona
supreme
court
thought
these
boys
were
genuinely
surprised,
or
thought
they
actually
expected
the
father
to
do
what
they
did?
unknown
speaker
most
of
those
facts
are
consistent
with
either
reading.
that's
what
puzzles
me.
unknown
speaker
either
that
they
were
surprised
or
they
were
not
surprised.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
talking
about
what
happened
in
the
prison.
that
has
nothing
to
do
whether
they
were
surprised
that
their
father
killed
this
family.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schafer,
limited
to
the
time
when
they
went
to
get
the
water,
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
shows
that
they
had
any
inclination
that
there
was
about
to
be
a
murder,
specifically?
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
factually,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
asking
about
after
he
said
go
get
the
water.
unknown
speaker
after
he
said,
go
get
the
water,
what
specifically
happened
or
was
said
that
makes
these
men
guilty
of
murder,
that
they
knew
the
father
was
going
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
asking
you
to
do.
if
we
limit
it
to
them
being
back
at
the
mazda,
which
ricky
disputes,
there
is
nothing,
i
think,
from
that
point
on,
except
the
firing
of
the
guns.
the
record
will
show
you
that
when
raymond
says
they
were
back
at
the
mazda--
--so
their
participation
in
the
firing
of
the
gun
was
zero?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
they
charged
with?
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
pull
the
trigger?
unknown
speaker
and
they
didn't
know
the
trigger
was
going
to
be
pulled?
unknown
speaker
i
said,
know.
did
they
know
it
was
going
to
happen?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
have
to
know
to
take
a
man's
life?
you
don't
have
to
answer.
unknown
speaker
is
that
any
different
than
saying
they
foresaw
that
lethal
force
would
be
used?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
don't.
but
is
there
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
what
are
you...
what
language
are
you
specifically
referring
to
in
enmund?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
reading
of
that
language
is
that
even
if
he
didn't
intend
that...
even
if
he
didn't
intend
that
life
be
taken,
he
nevertheless
might
be
guilty
if
the
likelihood
were...
and
the
circumstances
were
such
that
he
just
should
be...
that
that
would
make
him
culpable
too.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
equivalent
to
a
finding
of
intent?
unknown
speaker
whether
they
intended
these
particular
people
to
die
or
not?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
about
that,
though?
referring
again
to
that
critical
page
from
the
enmund
opinion,
the
next
sentence
refers
to
cases
in
which
death
so
frequently
occurs
in
the
course
of
a
felony
for
which
killing
is
not
an
essential
ingredient.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
killing
was
an
essential
ingredient
in
this
case
of
either
the
escape
or
the
kidnapping?
unknown
speaker
what
were
the
odds?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dershowitz,
let
me
go
back
to
your
jury
instruction
point.
who
requested
the
second
degree
murder
instruction?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
i
don't
understand
that.
to
be
second
degree
murder,
it
would
have
had
to
be
in
addition
to
felony
murder?
unknown
speaker
second
degree
was
higher
than
felony,
or
lower?
unknown
speaker
but
in
that
context...
in
that
context...
i
don't
see
why
the
trial
judge
wouldn't
handle
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
it
was
clearly
a
felony
murder
situation
as
the
law
was
at
that
time.
wasn't
it
clearly--
unknown
speaker
--i
doubt
that
the
jury
could
believe
that.
unknown
speaker
i
doubt
whether
the
jury
could
believe
that.
unknown
speaker
and
i
doubt
whether
the
trial
court
believed
the
jury
could
believe
that.
and
that's
why
he
said,
this
is
a
felony
murder
case.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
not
because
there
was
an
absence--
unknown
speaker
--it's
not
a
matter
of
there
being
no
evidence...
no
mens
rea
necessary
for
second
degree.
it's
a
matter
of
there
being
no
felony
necessary
for
felony.
when
you're
asking
for
a
lesser
instruction,
you're
asking
the
judge
to
tell
the
jury,
it's
possible
that
the
felony
conviction
won't
stand.
unknown
speaker
in
which
case
you
come
to
the
lesser
ones.
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
saying
is,
that
the
reason
he
made
his
ruling
is
not
because
there...
not
necessarily
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
intent
to
kill,
but
because
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
of
felony.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dershowitz,
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
what
it
boils
down
to,
in
your
view,
is
that
they're
holding
is
that
the
level
of
intent
required
for
an
enmund
finding
is
less
than
the
level
of
intent
required
for
second
degree
murder.
