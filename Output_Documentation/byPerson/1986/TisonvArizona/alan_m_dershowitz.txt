mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
arizona
seeks
to
execute
two
young
men
who
it
acknowledges
lacked
the
specific
intent
to
kill,
and
did
not,
in
fact,
kill.
it
also
acknowledges
the
categorical
rule,
as
this
court
categorized
it
in
cabana,
precluding
any
state
from
executing,
quote,
a
person
who
has
not
in
fact
killed,
attempted
to
kill,
or
intended
that
a
killing
take
place--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--the
state
concedes
that
there
was
no
specific
intent
to
kill,
and
that
there
was
no
killing.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well,
i'm
using
the
state's
language.
the
state
says,
in
its
brief,
the
original
conclusion--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--it
also
found,
in
its
first
appeal,
that
there
was
no
specific
intent--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--intended.
but
they
made
a
distinction
between
specific
or
individualized
intent--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--well,
i
real
from
the
state's
response
on
cert
where
it
says,
the
original
conclusion--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--but
the
state
has
construed
and
interpreted
the
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
matter.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
made
no
statement
at
all
in
the
second
appeal
about
whether
there
was
specific
intent
or
not.
they
just
said,
intent.
and
i
think
one
can
reasonably
read
the
second
opinion
and
the
first
opinion.
the
first
opinion
said
there
was
no
specific
intent.
the
second
opinion
said
there
was
intent.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
it
was
the
very
difference
that
was
raised
in
this
court
in
enmund,
and
the
argument
that
was
made
in
lockett:
actual
intent
versus
presumed
intent,
or
actual
intent
versus
legal
intent.
and
what
the
court
was
saying--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--they
found
beyond
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--well,
you're
supposed
to
ask
the
question,
how
did
they
construe
the
word
"intent".
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
legal
interpretation
of
intent.
put
another
way,
can
the
arizona
supreme
court
now
can
define
forseeability
as
intent,
after
this
court
stated
in
the
enmund
case,
in
specific
response,
by
the
way,
to
an
argument
made
by
the
arizona
supreme
court,
the
very
argument
it
makes
here
was
made
by
the
arizona
attorney
general--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--as
amicus,
as
amicus...
they
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
enmund
case...
and
they
argued,
quote,
it
is
just
as
proper
to
say
that
one
who
felony
murdered
through
a
risk
creation
was
at
fault
for
the
death
as
it
is
to
say
that
one
who
premeditatedly
murdered
was
at
fault
for
this
death.
and
they
should
be
treated
similarly.
the
same
argument
was
made
by
the
florida
attorney
general,
and
was
explicitly
rejected
by
this
court
in
enmund,
as
it
was,
your
honor,
rejected
by
you
in
the
lockett
case,
when
in
lockett...
remember
that
in
lockett
the
florida
court
had
found...
had
found
that
the
defendant
had
acted
purposefully.
and
then
your
honor,
in
your
opinion
in
that
case,
said,
purposefully,
however,
cannot
mean
presumptively
purposefully.
it
has
to
be
actually
purposefully.
and
that's
what
was
not
found
in
this
case.
so
what
we
have
here
is
an
attempt
essentially
to
relitigate
the
identical
issue
decided
by
the
enmund
case,
because
that
case
was
presented
precisely
to
this
court.
can
foreseeability
be
interpreted
to
mean
constructive
intent?
this
court?
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
yes,
yes.
there
is
a
degree
of
foreseeability,
and
that's
the
degree
of
foreseeability
this
court
set
out
in
the
enmund
case,
and
i
quote
its
language:
it
would
be
very
different
if
the
likelihood
of
a
killing
in
the
course
of
a
robbery
was
so
substantial
that
one
should
share
the
blame
for
the
killing
if
he
somehow
participated
in
the
felony.
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
define
it:
competent
observers
had
concluded
that
there
is
no
basis
in
experience
for
the
notion
that
death
so
frequently
occurs
in
the
course
of
a
felony,
for
which
killing
is
not
an
essential
ingredient,
that
the
death
penalty
would
be
warranted.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well,
in
this
case,
what
happened
is,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
argued
to
the
jury
that
it
was
part
of
the
plan,
of
the
breakout,
not
to
fire
any
weapons.
had
any
weapons
been
fired,
the
breakout
would
have
failed.
that
was
the
plan
that
was
used.
and
it
succeeded.
there
was
not
a
shot
fired.
there
had
been
a
promise
made
by
the
boys'
father
to
them
that
no
shots
would
be
fired.
the
plan
was
carefully
calculated--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--no,
no.
no,
no.
oh,
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no,
it
was
the
method
of
the
plan.
that
is,
a
plan
was
devised
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
shooting.
that
plan
worked.
not
a
shot
was
fired.
not
a
shot
was
fired
until
two
or
three
days
later,
when
the
father
took
the
young
boys
by
complete
surprise,
tricked
them
into
being
sent
away
for
water.
and
the
boys
at
that
point
certainly
were
entitled
to
rely
on
a
promise,
as
the
court
below
found...
and
this
is
a
very
crucial
finding.
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found,
the
killing
in
this
case
was
not
necessary
to
the
carrying
out
of
the
felony,
almost
as
if
to
answer
the
enmund
point,
saying,
if
it
was
so
essential
to
the
felony,
that
would
be
different.
but
they
found,
as
part
of
the
aggravating
factors,
ironically,
that
it
was
not
necessary.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
supreme
court.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
found,
as
did
the
trial
court,
that
the
killings
here
were
not
necessary.
if
they
were
not
necessary,
they
were
also
not
predictable.
i
mean
the
killings
of
the
lyons
family.
obviously,
there
were
two
situations
here,
the
breakout
at
the
prison,
carefully
planned
after
a
promise.
not
a
shot
was
fired.
had
a
shot
been
fired,
the
prosecutor
said
the
plan
would
have
failed.
that's
why
no
shots
were
fired.
three
days
later,
the
father
takes
the
young
boys
when
he's
holding
a
family
hostage
and
says,
in
response
to
the
pleas
of
the
victims,
please
go
back
and
get
us
water
and
keep
us
alive,
the
father
says
to
the
boys,
go
get
them
water
so
they
can
be
kept
alive,
as
the
boys
interpreted
it.
the
father
then
disables
the
car
so
it
can't
be
used.
the
message
was
clearly
sent
to
those
two
boys,
that
father
is
not
going
to
kill.
the
boys
are
then
not
in
a
position
of
control
when
the
father
kills.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
there
is
no
way,
your
honors,
with
all
due
respect,
of
reading
the
arizona
supreme
court
decision
as
finding
specific
intent.
they
categorically
do
not
find
specific
intent,
and
they
could
not
on
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
oh,
no,
no,
no.
we're
arguing
that
this
court
has
made
a
legal,
constitutional
conclusion
as
to
what
kind
of
intent
must
be
found.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
your
honor
in
lockett
characterized
it
as
purposefulness.
the
supreme
court
in
this
case...
in
enmund,
found
it
as
intent
in
fact.
what
this
court
has
done
is,
it's
taken
a
different
concept,
foreseeability,
a
concept
that
was
rejected
in
enmund,
and
it
said,
magically,
we
now
redefine
foreseeability
to
mean
intent.
if
that
were
allowed
to
stand,
any
state
could
now
circumvent
this
court's
decision
in
enmund
and
say,
well,
recklessness
means
intent.
well,
carelessness
means
intent.
when
this
court
said
intent--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--it
did.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
it
did,
and
the
attorney
general
acknowledges
it
did.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well,
i
think
first
you
should
ask
the
attorney
general
of
arizona,
and
he
will
tell
you
that's
he
convinced,
because
it's
clear.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no,
no.
because
if
you
can't--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--well,
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
that
is
clear.
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
specific
intent.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
your
honor,
we
think
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
but
we
think
not
only
can
there
be
no
finding...
and
that's,
by
the
way,
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
cabana
v.
bullock.
in
cabana
v.
bullock,
counsel
conceded
their
could
be
a
finding
on
the
record
of
intent
under
enmund.
in
this
case,
we
categorically
dispute
that.
the
state
of
arizona
agrees
with
us.
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
used
the
following
language
in
defining
intent:
intent
to
kill
includes
the
situation
in
which
the
defendant
intended--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--from
the
arizona
supreme
court's
decision,
second
appeal.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
on
page--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--on
page
345.
intent
to
kill
includes
the
situation
in
which
the
defendant
intended,
contemplated,
or
anticipated
that
lethal
force
would
or
might
be
used.
that
is
simply
not
the
definition
of
specific
intent.
it
is
not
the
american
law
institute's
definition.
it
is
not
the
definition
in
any
state.
it
is
the
exact
difference
between
specific
intent,
which
is
a
subjective,
personalized
standard,
and
an
objective
intent,
which
is
an
objective,
depersonalized
standard
of,
in
this
case,
recklessness.
and
i
don't
think
the
arizona
attorney
general
will
in
candor
try
to
argue
here
what
he
has
never
argued
in
the
brief
and
what
he
has
never
argued
below,
and
that
is,
that
there
was
a
specific
finding
of
specific
individualized
intent.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
what
the
state
did
here
is,
it
redefined
intent
to
fit
the
facts
of
this
case
into
the
enmund
holding
on
intent.
now--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--no,
that
was
not--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--no,
justice--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--that
is
not
enough,
justice
scalia.
what
is
enough--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--yes.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
that
would
be--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--that
would
be
enough
for
a
trigger
man.
a
trigger
man
who
shoots
with
reckless
disregard
for
human
life...
let
me
explain
why--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--no,
it's
not
just
probability.
the
trigger
man
has
control.
and
the
law
has
always
been
clear.
when
you
shoot
into
a
moving
bus;
when
you're
a
terrorist
and
you
shoot
into
a
crowd;
when
you're
shooting
from
a
fleeing...
from
a
policeman
when
you're
fleeing,
that
is
specific
intent.
because
what
you're
doing
is,
you're
shooting
without
regard
to
the
consequences.
in
this
case,
not
only
did
the
defendants
not
intend
to
kill.
the
intended
not
to
kill.
they--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--in
that
case--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--in
that
case,
courts
might
argue
that
it's
part
of
the
res
gestae,
that
you
were
there,
you
threw
the
gun.
this
is
a
very
different
case.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
that's
right.
and
it
might
conclude...
the
res
gestae
is
a
rule
of
evidence,
and
it
would
be
for
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not...
and
after
all,
this
court
has
said,
constructive
presence
is
not
enough;
constructive
killing
is
not
enough.
it
is
often
an
argument
that
this
court
has
been
involved
in
as
to
whether
something
is
actual
or
constructed.
and
in
the
felony
murder
death
penalty
issue,
this
court
has
demanded
actual
rather
than
constructive.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
right.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
for
a
trigger
man,
it
is
not
required
in
the
one
case
where
he
shoots
knowing
that
there
is
an
extremely
high
likelihood
that
death
will
result,
not
caring
which
person
he
kills.
that
was
the
origin
of
the
felony
murder
rule,
not
caring
which
person
he
kills.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
yes,
it
does.
it
has
one
example.
it
says,
it
would
be
very
different
if
the
likelihood
of
killing
was
so
substantial.
and
then
it
talks
about
a
felony
for
which
killing
is
an
essential
ingredient.
terrorism
is
an
example
of
that.
here--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--no,
no.
this
is
the...
this
is
the
example
that's
in
enmund.
i
am
responding
to
justice
scalia's
question
by
saying
that
intent
for
the
trigger
man
may
very
well
be
different
than
intent
for
the
non-trigger
man.
the
non-trigger
man
does
not
control
the
situation.
think
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
boys,
young
boys,
are
promised
by
their
father
that
there'll
be
no
shooting.
there
is
no
shooting.
the
boys
honestly
believe
and
intend
that
no
one
will
die.
it's
not
only
that
they
don't
intend
anyone
to
die,
or
they're
not
concerned
for
human
life.
they
intend
specifically
that
no
one
will
die.
they
do
everything
reasonably
within
their
power
to
assure
that
no
one
dies.
the
father
knows
that,
and
has
to
trick
them...
except
in
the
beginning--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--your
honor,
they
should
be
punished.
and
they
are
being
punished,
very
severely,
for
the
separate
crime
of
bringing
guns
in,
of
breaking
their
father
out
of
prison.
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
they
had
the
intent
required
for
a
non-trigger
man
for
execution.
these
young
boys
will
spend
the
rest
of
their
lives
in
prison
for
the
very
serious
crimes
they've
committed.
they
have
provided
guns--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--your
honor,
lockett
provided
guns.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well,
of
course
if
he
has
an
intent
to
kill.
but
there's
no
way
that
act
alone--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--first
of
all,
the
defendant
who
doesn't
care
whether
defendant
lives
or
dies
is
in
a
very
different
situation
from
these
defendants
who
cared
deeply
that
someone
lived,
not
died.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
theory
of
intent
is
that
for
a
trigger
man,
recklessness
in
the
sense
of
absolute
disregard
for
human
life
is
enough.
for
a
non-trigger
man
it
is
not.
you
have
to
have
a
specific
intent.
and--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--no,
it
would
not
be
enough
for
a
trigger
man...
for
a
non-trigger
man
to
have
thrown
a
gun
to
somebody
without
intending
to--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--that
wouldn't
be
enough.
no,
no.
and
that
is
not
this
case
in
any
event.
this
case
is
handing
guns
over
under
an
agreement
that
no
shooting
would
take
place.
no
shooting...
this
is
lockett.
in
lockett,
he
gave
him
the
guns,
too.
in
lockett
the
guns
were
provided.
in
enmund
the
guns
were
provided.
what
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
is
asking
for,
in
a
sense,
is
a
return
to
the
felony
murder
rule
where
guns
are
provided.
and
to
throw
a
hypothetical
back,
which
i'm
not
entitled
to
do,
but
i'll
throw
it
back
to
myself,
what
if
the
defendant...
what
if
there
were
a
statute
saying,
anyone
who
provides
guns
to
an
armed
robber
in
the
course
of
an
armed
robbery,
whereby
death
results,
is
guilty
of
first-degree
capital
murder?
that
would
be
clearly
within
enmund.
that's
what
enmund
decided.
because
the
facts
of
enmund
were
exactly
that.
there
is
no
difference
between
this
case
and
enmund,
except
that
this
case
is
far
more
compelling.
in
this
case,
there
was
an
intent
not
to
kill.
this
was--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--the
state
certainly
argued
that
he
had
provided
the
gun
in
enmund.
the
gun
had
belonged
to
his
common
law
wife.
he
then
disposed
of
the
gun.
certainly,
a
reasonable
judge
and
jury
could
conclude
that
he
had
provided
the
gun.
it
was
an
armed
robbery.
he
was
the
one
who
planned
the
robbery.
in
this
case,
these
young
boys
were
brought
into
the
robbery
at
the
last
minute.
one
of
the
codefendants,
greenawalt,
directed
what
went
on
in
the
penitentiary.
their
father
directed
what
went
on
thereafter.
they
had
no...
there
was
never
a
time
when
you
could
have
left
their
father's
side,
when
the
father
left
any
of
them
alone,
the
three
of
them,
so
that
they
could
leave.
these
are
young
kids
under
the
control
of
their
father.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
they
were
18
and
19.
no
prior
criminal
records.
their
father
had
made
them
a
promise.
their
father
had
been
planning
a
breakout
for
awhile.
they
were
brought
into
it
at
the
very
last
minute.
no
shots
were
fired.
three
days
later...
or
2-1/2
days
later...
their
father
had
to
send
them
away,
again,
to
trick
them
and
fool
them
into
believing
no
shooting
would
occur.
and
when
they
were
away
from
the
scene,
or
close,
or
coming
back,
the
father...
and
there's
no
dispute
about
this--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--your
honor,
we
are
willing
to
have
the
facts
taken
in
the
light
least
favorable
to
the
defendants,
as
the
arizona
supreme
court
found
them.
because
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
they
didn't
kill.
there
is
not
dispute
that
the
father
sent
them
away.
there
is
no
dispute
that
they
were
carrying
small
arms,
and
the
father
was
carrying--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--what
happens--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--well,
here's
the
situation:
were
it
not
for
the
statements
of
these
young
boys,
there'd
be
no
evidence
they
committed
the
crime.
the
only
evidence
of
their
involvement
comes
from
the
statement.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
not
under
arizona
law,
your
honor.
no,
under
arizona
law,
a
document,
a
statement,
an
admission,
cannot
be
taken
apart
and
believed
for
one
purpose
and
not
believed
for
another,
when
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts.
there
is
no
way,
your
honor--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--it
may
have.
but
your
honor,
there's
no
way
under
arizona
law...
and
i'd
be
interested
to
see
what
the
attorney
general
says
about
this...
in
which
where
an
undisputed
fact
is
made
as
part
of
a
statement
in
a
confession,
and
that
is
admitted
into
evidence,
where
undisputed,
the
trial
court
can
disbelieve
that
and
believe
its
opposite.
if
one
even
ignores
it,
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
issue.
but
there
is
absolutely
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record
of
this
case
which
could
lead
a
fact
finder
to
the
opposite
conclusion,
which
could
lead
a
fact
finder
to
determine
that
there
was
specific
intent.
that's
why
arizona
concedes
there's
no
specific
intent.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
we
of
course
accept
the
facts
that
are
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
those
facts
are
accurate.
there's
no
dispute
between
what
the
majority
found
and
what
the
dissent
found
or
what
the
arizona
attorney
general
finds.
there
is
a
set
of
facts.
there
is
surmise
or
speculation
one
can
engage
in.
but
arizona
law
does
require
that
these
facts
be
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
right.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
your
honors,
we
invite,
and
urge,
in
fact,
the
court
to
read
in
full
the
statement
from
this
"very
close
life
or
death
situation.
"
statement
comes.
because
it's
very
clear
what
the
boys
saying
is,
afterward
we
realized
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
life
could
be
taken.
we
certainly
didn't
want
it
to
be
taken.
we
didn't
really
think
about
it.
that
was
the
actual
statement.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
young
man
carried
small
guns
throughout
the
escape;
never
fired
the
guns.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
without...
yes.
without
a
gun,
one
of
the
young
boys
was,
as
he
put
it,
elected--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--by
the
father...
without
the
gun...
the
young
boy
was
elected
to
go
and
wave
the
car
down.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
he
knew,
because
the
father
told
him,
that
the
car
would
be
taken.
the
car
was
taken.
the
transfer
was
made.
nobody
is
denying
their
responsibility
for
these
serious
crimes
of
kidnapping,
breakout
of
prison.
but
then
after
the
crime
was
completed,
after
the
car
was
taken,
the
father
then,
without
any
necessity...
as
the
courts
found;
no
necessity
at
all;
could
have
easily
have
left
them
there...
the
father
and
the
other
defendant,
on
their
own,
after
sending
the
boys
away,
made
a
shocking
and
surprising
decision
to
kill
this
family
in
cold
blood.
there
are
findings
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
it
was
not
necessary,
that
it
was
spontaneous,
it
was
not
part
of
the
original
plan.
this
is
just
like
enmund.
in
enmund
there
was
spontaneity.
it
was
not
part
of
the
original
plan.
after
enmund
left
the
person
to
go
into
the
house,
something
unexpected
happened.
in
this
case
it
was
the
father
who
did
something
unexpected.
in
the
other
case
it
was
the
gunman.
a
family
was
tragically
killed
in
both
cases.
this
arizona
case
is
an
attempt
to
relitigate
enmund.
and
we
will
hear
relitigation
after
relitigation
in
every
state
if
this
court
allows
every
state
to
redefine
intent
the
way
it
chooses
to
redefine
it.
nobody
again
disputes...
and
i
want
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal...
the
fact
that
these
young
men
wanted
nobody
to
die.
they
were
tricked
into
standing
away
while
the
father
slaughtered
the
family
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
that
is
the
finding
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
that
kind
of
nonspecific
intent,
foreseeability,
can
be
redefined
to
mean
the
kinds
of
intent
that
this
court
said
is
constitutionally
required
to
execute
under
enmund.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
thank
you.
first,
there
is
a
specific
finding
on
page
336
that
it
was
not
essential
to
the
defendants'
continued
evasion
of
arrest
that
these
persons
be
murdered.
second,
i
must
correct
the
record,
because
this
court
has
been
badly
misinformed
about
the
status
of
ricky
tison's
statements.
we
heard
from
the
attorney
general
that
ricky
tison
consistently
said
he
was
not
sent
away
to
get
water.
i
categorically
dispute
that.
there
is
not
a
single
statement
in
this
record
by
ricky
in
which
he
does
not
consistently
say
that
the
boys,
all
three
of
them,
were
sent
away
to
get
water.
there
is
only
a
dispute
as
to
whether
they
remained
there
at
the
time
the
shooting
began,
whether
they
were
on
the
way
back
or
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
in
fact,
ricky's
first
statement
when
he
was
arrested
at
gunpoint
at
the
shootout
is...
and
here's
the
testimony
at
the
trial...
at
this
point
gary
told
the
boys
to
go
back
and
get
the
water--
everybody
agrees
with
that.
at
about
the
time
they
got
back
to
the
mazda...
the
mazda...
they
heard
the
shotguns
go
off.
due
to
the
darkness,
all
they
could
see
were
flashes
from
the
shotguns.
there
is
a
disagreement,
we
acknowledge
that.
the
state
concedes
that
it
is
essential
to
this
case
that
they
be
present
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
why
is
presence
essential?
generally,
presence
is
essential
because
it
is
evidentially
relevant
to
the
intent
of
the
defendants.
buy
here
we
have
presence
if...
at
best,
presence
coming
back...
after
any
doubts
had
been
resolved
in
their
minds
about
whether
the
father
would
kill,
when
the
father
says,
no,
go
get
the
water.
and
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
record
of
this
case,
you
will
see
on
page
21
that
the
young
boy's
statement,
saying
that
i
thought
the
father
was
struggling
with
this
case,
is
followed
by,
that's
what
i
think
now
about
it.
in
other
words,
at
the
time
of
the
confession,
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
father
was
struggling.
there
is
a
lot
of
chronological
confusion
in
this
case.
when
the
young
boys'
statements
are
read
as
such,
they
always
come
out
saying,
in
effect,
at
the
time
we
didn't
know
what
was
going
on.
then
they're
in
jail,
or
they're
arrested,
and
they're
asked
about
their
state
of
mind,
and
they
reconstruct
their
state
of
mind
as
of
that
point
in
time.
the
state
categorizes
the
enmund
finding
as
a
finding
of
fact.
it
is
anything
but
a
finding
of
fact.
it
is
a
construction
of
law.
it
deserves
no
weight
by
this
court.
it
is
an
attempt
to
reinterpret
enmund's
intent.
statements
of
fact
have
been
found,
and
they
were
found
in
our
favor.
for
example...
i
hope
i
can
do
this
briefly...
during
the
second...
the
first
appeal,
one
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
defendants
was
whether
or
not
they
were
entitled
to
a
second
degree
murder
instruction.
under
arizona
law,
if
there
was
any
evidence
to
support
second
degree
murder,
they
would
be
entitled
to
it.
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
they
were
not
entitled
to
a
second
degree
instruction,
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
second
degree
murder;
only
evidence
of
felony
murder.
second
degree
murder
would
include
foreseeability,
recklessness,
all
of
the
things
we're
talking
about.
yet
the
arizona
supreme
court
rejected
an
instruction
on
second
degree
murder,
saying,
therefore,
that
this
was
an
all
or
nothing
case.
this
was
felony
murder,
that
is,
accidental
murder
carried
out
in
the
course
of
a
felony,
or
it
was
not
murder
at
all.
and
if
that's
not
the
case,
then
they're
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
because
in
arizona
law,
if
there
was
any
evidence
of
recklessness,
of
second
degree
murder,
in
this
case,
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
the
jury
should
not
have
had
an
all-or-nothing,
if
you
don't
find
felony
murder,
you
free
them
outright.
that
should
not
have
been
the
issue,
and
that
was
not
the
case
under
arizona
law.
the
attorney
general
said
that
the
penalty
here
was
tailored
to
these
particular
individuals.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
the
trial
court's
findings
about
these
two
young
boys
who
never
fired
a
shot
were
exactly
the
same,
word
for
word,
as
its
findings
about
greenawalt
who
actually
gunned
down
all
the
killers,
and
intended
to
do
so.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
defendants.
and
they
had
a
point.
if
there
was
any
evidence
under
law
of
second
degree
murder,
they
were
entitled
to
that
instruction.
and
the
court
said
there
was
no
evidence
of
second
degree
murder.
the
court
has
also
found,
in
the
first
opinion,
in
effect,
that
there
was
no
such
evidence.
so
i
think
they
were...
i
think
what
we
have
here--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--there
were
three
levels
of
intent
under
arizona
law.
premeditated:
irrelevant
in
this
case.
felony
murder,
accidental:
maybe
it
happened,
maybe
it
didn't.
third
level
is
higher
than
accidental,
but
lower
than
premeditated.
that's
second
degree
murder.
if
there
was
any
evidence
of
an
intent
between
premeditated
and
accidental,
they
were
entitled
to
that
second
degree
murder
instruction.
and
the
court
said,
in
rejecting
that
argument,
this
is
either-or.
there
was
no
evidence
on
the
record
of
this
case
of...
short
of
premeditation,
of
recklessness,
foreseeability,
or
any
other
element
of
mens
rea
that
would
entitle
the
state
not
to
have
a
second
degree
conviction,
or
the
defendant
to
have
a
second
degree
murder
instruction.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
intent
level
of
second
degree
is
higher
than
the
intent
level
for
felony
murder.
the
penalty
is
higher
for
felony
murder
than
it
is
for
second
degree.
that's
traditional.
second
degree
murder
requires
not
premeditation,
but
some
level
of
mens
rea
more
than
accidental.
in
this
case,
the
judge
said...
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
was
all
or
nothing.
either
there
was
evidence
of
felony
murder,
or
there
was
no
evidence
of
murder.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
give
a
second
degree
murder
instruction?
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
but
what
if
the
jury
disbelieved,
your
honor,
that
the
felony
was
still
going
on?
for
example,
one
of
the
arguments
made
at
trial
was,
the
felonies
had
stopped
when
the
transfer
was
made.
the
car
had
been
stolen.
they
had
gotten
all
they
want.
and
the
murders
occurred
promiscuously
by
these
defendants
afterward.
if
the
jury
had
believed
that,
without
a
second
degree
murder
instruction,
they
either
had
to
acquit
these
people
of
murder
altogether,
or
convict
improperly
of
felony
murder.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
jury
could
believe--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--the
jury--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--your
honor,
the
trial
court
has
no
right
to
conclude--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
--whether
or
not
a
jury
would
believe;
this
is
not
a
civil
case,
your
honor.
the
trial
court
can't
direct
a
verdict
on
any
aspect
of
the
government's
burden
of
proof.
the
defendants
did
not
testify.
the
burden
was
on
the
government
to
prove
that
there
was
a
felony
that
continued.
the
defendants
contested
that
through
their
lawyer.
for
a
second
degree
murder
instruction,
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
an
assumption
by
the
trial
court
that
the
jury
might
have
disbelieved
the
felony
was
ongoing,
and
were
therefore
entitled
to
a
second
degree
murder
instruction
unless
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
mens
rea
sufficient
for
second
degree
murder.
and
that's
what
this
court
held,
that
there
was
no
such
evidence.
and
there
is
no
such
evidence.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
that's
right.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
and
that's
exactly
what
they
were
entitled
to.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
your
honor,
no
judge
is
allowed
to
assume
that
the
jury
will
believe
overwhelming
evidence.
and
it
wasn't
overwhelming
that
the
felony
continued.
the
issue
in
this
case
was
not,
was
there
a
felony,
but
was
this
murder,
carried
on
by
the
trigger
men,
carried
on
as
part
of
a
felony
which
had
already
terminated?
a
jury
could
easily
disbelieve
that,
and
then
it
stuck
either
with
nothing
or
a
second
degree
murder
conviction.
in
many
cases
like
this,
you
get
a
second
degree
murder
conviction.
if
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
a
second
degree
murder
conviction,
they
were
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
if
they
were
not,
then
there
is
a
finding
in
this
record,
as
there
already
is
a
finding
in
this
record,
on
the
second
appeal,
that
the
level
of
intent
required
for
the
enmund
finding
has
not
been
met
in
this
case.
so
we
think,
your
honors,
that
the
legal
issue
has
already
been
resolved
by
this
court
in
enmund.
the
factual
has
already
been
resolved
by
the
supreme
court
in
arizona.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
level
of
intent
required
for
second
degree
murder
in
this
case
is
clearly,
everybody
would
acknowledge,
less
than
what
is
required
for
enmund.
second
degree
murder...
no
state
punishes
second
degree
murder
by
death.
the
penalty...
the
level
of
intent
required
for
second
degree
murder
includes
clearly
things
that
are
not
specific
intent.
that
is
our
argument.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
they
had
a
level
of
intent
which
comes
within
the
supreme
court's
definition,
in
enmund,
of
specific
intent.
but
we're
arguing
alternatively,
there
is
not
even
a
finding,
nor
could
there
be
a
finding
on
this
record,
because
the
finding
is
to
the
opposite
effect,
that
even
a
level
of
foreseeability
that
is
argued
for
by
the
state
could
not
be
met
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
thank
you.
