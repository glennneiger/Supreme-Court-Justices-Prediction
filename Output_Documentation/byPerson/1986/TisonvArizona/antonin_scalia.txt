what
degree
of
foreseeability
under
our
test
do
you
think
is
permissible?
what
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
supplying
the
inmates
of
a
prison
who
were
planning
a
breakout
with
substantial
quantities
of
arms
in
order
to
break
out?
what
are
the
probabilities
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that's
enough
to
eliminate
the
probability,
the
mere
fact
that
he
got
a
promise
from
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--incarcerated
felon
that
he
wouldn't
fire
these
guns
that
were
delivered
to
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dershowitz,
i'm
still
not
clear
on
what
you
mean
by
specific
intent.
i
thought
you
had
agreed
that
probability
is
enough;
that
if
you
intend
to
do
something
which,
although
you
don't
intend
that
somebody
die,
it
is
very
probable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
somebody's
death
would
come
from
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
not
enough
for
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
what
if
i'm
committing
a
felony,
and
i'm
carrying
a
gun,
and
a
police
officer
comes
toward
me
to
stop
the
felony
and
i
shoot
at
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
frankly
don't
care
whether
he
lives
or
dies.
i
just
want
to
prevent
him
from
stopping
the
felony.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
do
not
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
just
probability,
then,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
i
through
the
gun
to
the
trigger
man,
as
the
policeman's
approaching
him,
he
says,
i
need
a
gun,
and
i
throw
the
gun
to
him.
and
again,
i
don't
care
whether
he
kills
the
policeman
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
have
intent
to
kill?
justice
antonin
scalia
probability
is
always
involved,
isn't
it?
well,
res
gestae
is
a
rule
of
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
depends
to
some
extent
on
probability.
i
didn't
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--please,
please.
i
don't
understand
your
response
to
the
second
hypothetical
i
put
to
you.
never
mind
the
trigger
man.
the
person
who
tosses
the
gun
to
the
trigger
man.
there
is
no
way
in
which
he
has
an
intent
to
kill
within
the
constitutional
role;
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
he
doesn't...
he
doesn't
care
whether
the
policeman
lives
or
dies.
but
the
trigger
man
asks
for
a
gun.
"toss
me
a
gun".
he
tosses
him
the
gun.
could
he
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand.
but
please
answer
my
hypothetical.
i'm
trying
to
see
what
your
theory
of
intent
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
answer
to
my
hypothetical
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says:
"there's
a
policeman
coming.
"
"throw
me
a
gun
quick.
"
that
wouldn't
be
enough?

gun?
