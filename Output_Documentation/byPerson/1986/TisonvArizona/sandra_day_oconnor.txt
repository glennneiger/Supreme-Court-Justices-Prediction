justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
certiorari
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
the
petitioners'
helped
plan
and
participated
in
a
prison
escape
by
their
father
gary
tison
and
randy
greenawalt
both
convicted
murderers.
in
the
course
of
their
flight
from
the
prison,
the
petitioners
have
abducted,
robbed
and
detained
a
family
of
four
and
watch
their
father
and
greenawalt
brutally
murder
their
victims.
the
petitioners
were
convicted
of
murder
under
arizona's
felony-murder
statute
and
sentenced
to
death.
in
postconviction
proceedings
they
argued
that
they
lacked
the
sufficiently
culpable
mental
state
to
support
constitutional
imposition
of
the
death
sentences
under
this
court's
holding
in
enmund
against
florida.
the
arizona
supreme
court
found
that
although
the
petitioners
did
not
specifically
intend
that
the
victims
would
die
and
did
not
plan
the
homicide
or
fire
the
shots
that
the
requisite
intent
within
the
meaning
of
enmund
was
established
because
they
could
have
anticipated
that
life
would
or
might
be
taken,
in
the
course
of
their
crimes.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
the
court
holds
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
permit
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
upon
the
findings
made
by
the
arizona
supreme
court.
but
that
the
record
in
this
case
could
support
findings
that
the
petitioners
were
both
major
participants
in
the
crimes,
giving
rise
to
the
application
of
the
felony-murder
rule,
and
that
they
acted
with
reckless
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life.
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
forbid
the
execution
of
the
felony-murder
under
those
circumstances.
the
death
sentences
upheld
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
are
therefore
vacated
and
the
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
joins
in
its
entirety
and
in
parts
1
through
4a
of
which
justices
blackman
and
stevens
have
joined.
