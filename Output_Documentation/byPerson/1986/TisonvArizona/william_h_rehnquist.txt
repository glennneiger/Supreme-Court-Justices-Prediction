chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
tison
versus
arizona.
mr.
dershowitz,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
dershowitz--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
mean
the
supreme
court--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you've
just
agreed,
i
though,
with
justice
scalia
that
actual
intent
in
the
pristine
sense
of
that
word,
i
shoot
at
you
intending
to
kill
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
not
required
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
how
can
you
be
sure
that
that
is
the
only
exception
to
the
requirement
of
pristine
intent?
certainly
enmund
does
not
say,
this
example
and
this
example
only
is
the
exception?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
these
are
your
examples,
simply
drawn
from
far
more
general
language
than
enmund.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
were
18
and
19
at
the
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
resolving
all
the
factual
doubts
in
favor
of
your
clients,
it
seems
to
me.
and
we
have
to
take
the
facts,
presumably,
as
found
by
the
arizona
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
there
are
no
dispute
about
these
facts...
you
say
that
there
are
no
dispute
about
these
facts.
you're
presumably
relying
on
testimony
of
one
of
the
parties.
but
the
courts
don't
have
to
rely...
don't
have
to
take
the
testimony
of
any
interested
witness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
it's
not
disputed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
state
isn't...
the
trier
of
fact
is
entitled
to
believe
what
it
wants
and
disbelieve
what
it
wants.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
arizona...
if
that...
arizona
law
has
changed
a
great
deal
since
i
practice
there,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dershowitz.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
schafer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schafer.
mr.
dershowitz,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
dershowitz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
84-6075,
tison
against
arizona
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
