did
you
say
the
state
concedes
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
the
state
says,
what
about
the
supreme...
what
did
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
find?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
second?
they
recited
the
facts
and
said
that
the
evidence
demonstrates
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
petitioner
intended
to
kill.
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
talking
about
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
we
have
to
look...
we're
reviewing
that
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
difference
between
intent
and
specific
intent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
the...
i
thought,
as
i
read
their
second
opinion,
they
went
through
these
facts,
and
they
found
intent,
based
on
those
facts,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
--mr.
dershowitz,
suppose
we
read
the
supreme
court
opinion
as
saying
specific
intent
or
any
other
kind
of
intent
that
satisfies
enmund
we
found
to
be
present
in
this
case?
then
we
must
go
and
say,
what?
what
would
then
be
our
standard
to
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
accept
my
assumption
for
the
moment,
that
that's
the
way
we
read
it.
now,
what
would
be
our
standard,
then,
of
reviewing
that
finding?
you're
arguing
the
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
again,
just
suppose
we
don't
understand
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
to
have
applied
a
legal
standard--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
say
it,
but
i'm
not
all
that
much
convinced.
so
if
i'm
not
convinced,
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
but
give
me
some
advice.
what
should
i
do
if
i
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
purported
to
apply
the
right
standard
of
intent?
then
do
i
go
through
these
facts
and
say,
well,
they
just
made
a
mistake?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
there's
no
evidence
to
support
their
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that's
true,
of
course,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
are
you
reading...
what
are
you
reading
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
where...
on
what
page
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
second,
not
the
first,
appeal?
