mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
this
case
raises
three
issues
that
stem
from
enmund.
the
first,
i
believe,
is
whether
arizona
courts
adequately
addressed
the
enmund
issue
at
all.
the
second,
i
believe,
is
whether
enmund
prohibits
a
death
sentence
for
someone
who
did
not
do
the
actual
act
of
killing.
and
the
third
is,
what
should
this
court
do
with
a
state
court
finding
of
fact
that
enmund
has
been
complied
with,
as
there
was
such
a
finding
here.
i
will
address
those
three
issues,
in
that
order.
first,
did
arizona
adequately
address
the
enmund
issue
to
begin
with?
and
i
believe
that
it
did.
a
defendant's
participation,
relative
to
the
participation
of
the
others,
has,
since
1974,
always
been
a
concern
in
death
penalty
cases
in
arizona.
one
of
the
statutory
factors
that
may
mitigate
a
sentence
is
a
defendant's
minor
participation
in
the
crime,
again
compared
to
other
participants
in
the
crime.
whether
or
not
the
defendant
raises
that
point
in
the
trial
court,
which
is
the
sentencer
in
the
state
of
arizona,
the
sentencer
must
determine
what
the
extent
of
the
defendant's
participation
was;
and
if
it
was
minor,
according
to
the
statute,
that
may...
but
it
does
not
necessarily...
mean
that
the
sentence
may
be
mitigated.
now
prior
to
about
1978,
the
consideration
that
was
given
to
that
particular
factor,
the
minor
participation,
was
rather
perfunctory.
that
changed,
however,
with
the
lockett
opinion,
and
the
questions
it
posed
as
to
whether
a
death
sentence
could
be
imposed
on
one
who
had
no
intent
to
kill,
which
was
the
language
in
lockett.
this
case,
i
believe,
is
an
example
of
that
change.
here
the
trial
court
had
before
it
the
two
statements
of
each
of
the
petitioners,
that
each
of
them
gave
prior
to
their
trials.
the
reports
the
trial
court
also
had
of
the
probation
department,
one
of
which
contained
a
very
detailed
summary
of
a
conversation
with
raymond
tison;
and
the
trial
court
also
had
the
evaluation
report
of
each
petitioner
that
was
done
by
a
court
appointed
doctor
named
doctor--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
all
i
can
tell
you
is,
he
was
the
younger
of
the
two,
i
believe.
he
was
the
one
who
drove
eventually
the
lincoln
off
into
the
bushes
at
apparently
the
request
of
his
father.
he
was
the
one
who
also
said
that
he
believed
that
the
boys
were
at
the
mazda
when
the
actual
shootings
took
place.
ricky,
however,
tells
a
different
story.
also,
each
petitioner...
and
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
fact...
submitted
written
memos
to
the
trial
court,
prior
to
the
sentencing,
arguing
the
aggravation
and
the
mitigation,
specifically
addressing
themselves
to
lockett,
and
the
question
it
raised
of
intent
and
limited
participation.
the
state,
in
those
memos,
argued
that
a
death
penalty
could
be
imposed
for
murder
felony;
and
the
petitioners
argued,
among
other
things...
they
had
a
rather
lengthy
memo...
that
they
had
no
intent
to
kill,
and
that
under
lockett,
their
participation
was
so
minor,
their
participation
was
so
limited,
that
a
death
sentence
would
be
disproportionate
to
their
involvement
in
the
crime.
after
a
joint
sentencing...
and
the
sentencing
was
joint
as
to
both
petitioners
here
and
also
as
to
all
the
crimes
committed;
and
that,
by
the
way,
involved
actual
live
evidence
other
than
the
statements
i've
mentioned,
concerning
not
only
this
case,
but
the
other
crimes
that
were
committed...
after
that
hearing,
the
trial
court
said
that
he
disagreed
with
the
petitioners'
arguments.
he
said
that
their
involvement
was
not
minor;
that
they
were
active
and
equal
participants
right
up
to
the
moment
of
the
shooting;
and
that
they
had
to
share
equal
blame
with
everyone
else.
then
that
point,
the
extent
of
their
participation,
was
specifically
argued
in
briefs
and
argued
orally
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
by
both
petitioners
on
a
direct
appeal.
and
the
arizona
supreme
court,
after
its
own
independent
review
of
the
record
which
it
does
in
every
death
penalty
case
in
arizona,
the
arizona
supreme
court
came
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
trial
court.
the
participation
of
each
of
the
petitioners,
they
said,
was
not
minor.
it
was
substantial,
said
the
court,
and
the
blame
that
they
each
had
was
equal
to
that
of
the
actual
killers.
then
the
arizona
supreme
court,
citing
both
lockett
and
the
eighth
amendment,
said,
and
i
quote:
we
assent
to
the
retributive
principle
of
justice,
which
demands
that
persons
be
punished
in
proportion
to
their
personal
involvement
in
the
crime,
focussing
the
inquiry
on
the
harm
which
may
fairly
be
attributed
to
the
participants'
conduct.
now
that
ended
the
direct
appeal
on
those
murder
convictions.
a
few
years
later,
this
court
announced
its
decision
in
enmund
v.
florida.
and
following
that,
both
of
these
petitioners
filed
state
petitions
for
post-conviction
relief.
again,
along
with
other
things,
they
both
contended
that
enmund
precluded
a
death
sentence
in
their
case.
the
state
responded,
and
the
trial
court
denied
the
petitions
without
oral
argument.
each
petitioner
then
requested
the
arizona
supreme
court
to
review
that
dismissal,
and
the
supreme
court
ordered
additional
briefing,
and
specifically
ordered
briefing
on
the
application
of
enmund,
and
ordered
briefing
on
the
language
in
enmund
concerning
lethal
force.
oral
argument
was
had
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
on
those
issues.
and
the
supreme
court
then
delivered
an
opinion
addressing
enmund
and
its
application
to
the
facts.
and
the
supreme
court
sustained
each
of
the
death
sentences,
holding
that
the
facts
were
significantly
different
from
enmund...
that's
almost
a
quote
from
the
arizona
supreme
court.
and
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
satisfied
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
tisons
intended
to
kill,
and
that,
they
said,
the
dictates
of
enmund
were
satisfied.
now,
from
that
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
both
tisons
petitioned
this
court.
through
all
of
this,
the
trial
court,
twice
in
the
arizona
supreme
court,
two
oral
arguments
in
the
supreme
court,
the
emphasis
was
on
the
individual
participation
of
each
petitioner,
and
the
individual
culpability
of
each
of
the
petitioners.
in
each
instance,
the
penalty
was
tailored
to
fit
the
individual
blameworthiness.
now,
i
do
not
believe
that
enmund
requires
anything
more
than
that.
i
believe
the
record
will
show
you
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
did
adequately
address
the
enmund
issue.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
the
second
and
third
issues
present,
i
believe,
whether
enmund--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
it
is
sufficient,
and
i
believe,
to
a
word,
those
are
the
words
this
court
used
at
various
places
in
the
enmund
opinion.
and
i've
attempt
to
lay
those
forth
in
the
brief.
the
word,
i
believe,
that
the
petitioners
pick
up
on
is
the
word
"might".
however,
the
word
458
u.s.
page
788,
where
this
court
uses
the
word
"might".
now,
i
did
not
argue
this
case
in
the
arizona
supreme
court.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that
the
arizona
supreme
court,
from
my
knowledge
of
this
case,
because
it
was
my
people
who
wrote
the
brief
and
argue
it--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--we
dispute,
your
honor,
that
the
boys
did
go
to
get
the
water.
and
in
my
brief,
i
attempted
to
lay
that
forth.
the
statement
of
raymond
tison
says
that
his
father
said,
after
mr.
lyons
asked
for
water,
and
don't
kill
us,
he
said,
give
us
water,
we'll
be
able
to
stay
here
until
tomorrow
afternoon,
or
words
essentially
to
that
effect.
raymond
tison
then
says:
we
went
to
the
mazda
to
get
the
water.
that's
apparently
where
the
water
was,
and
they
all
knew
it.
that
is
not
what
ricky
says,
however.
ricky
says--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--you
might
very
well,
your
honor.
and
i
can't--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--i
can't--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--i
can't
cite
you
any
place
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
to
you
why
he
said
that.
however,
it
may
well
have
been...
we
can
speculate...
that
he
was
trying--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--i
would
not
speculate
on
a
man's
life.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
the
only
thing
i
intend
to
speculate
on
is
the
answer
to
your
question,
which
was
why
would
he
do
that?
why
would
he
say
such
a
thing--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
he
said
that.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no,
i
dispute
that,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
anything
in
the
record
that
gary
tison--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--raymond
went
to
get
the
water,
your
honor.
that's
not
what
ricky
said
in
ricky's
statement.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
again,
the
record
does
not
show
why
raymond
did
that.
what
it
does
show
is
that
raymond
went
to
get
the
water
because
he
thought
that's
what
his
father
was
asking
him
to
do.
i
believe
more
correctly,
raymond
would
not
say
that
my
father
was
asking
me
to
do
that.
i
think
what
raymond
says
is,
that
was
directed
to
the
boys.
however...
and
there
were
three
at
the
time.
one
of
the
brothers
is
dead,
donny.
there
are
two
left.
however,
ricky
does
not
say
that
at
all.
ricky
tison
in
his
statements,
and
he's
consistent
throughout
those
statements,
says
that
they
were
there
when
the
shots
were
fired.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
ricky
says
that
they
watched
the
shots
being
fired.
he
says,
they
stood
back
and
they
watched.
that's
not
what
raymond
says.
raymond's
recollection,
according
to
the
statements,
is
that
he
was
50
to
75
yards
away.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
think
he
goes
further
than
that.
he
says,
he
heard
them
and
saw
the
flashes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
he
was
a
few
yards
away,
yes.
that's
what
raymond
says.
that's
not
what
ricky
says,
however.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
your
honor,
they
couldn't
get
five
miles
away--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--no,
i
believe,
for
the
language
of
the
arizona
supreme
court...
and
it
fits
the
facts,
i
think,
perfectly
as
i've
laid
them
out
in
the
brief.
and
i
do
have
to
admit
that
there's
a
dispute
between
what
raymond
says
and
what
ricky
says
as
to
where
they
were.
but
one
of
our
points
that
we
have
argued,
and
i
believe
we
have
argued
it
consistently,
is
that
these
two
individuals
participated,
not
only
in
the
underlying
felonies,
but
they
actually
participated
in
the
murder
up
to
the
time
the
trigger
was
fired.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
think
that
would
be
different,
and
i
would
probably
be
making
a
different
argument
to
you.
but
i
also
believe--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--i
think
their
presence
at
the
scene
is
important,
but
you
have
to
couple
that--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--oh,
no.
i
believe,
in
this
case,
it's
essential.
if
you're
asking
me
in
another
case
can
i
envision
a
case
that
would
satisfy
the
dictate
of
enmund
where
an
individual
was
not
present
at
the
scene,
yes,
i
certainly
can.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
my
answer
to
you
would
be,
i
think
in
order
to
show
that
these
two
petitioners
contemplated
and
knew
what
was
going
on,
that
we
would
probably
have
to
go
further
than
the
scenario
you've
given
me.
and
i
think
in
this
case,
there
is
much
more
than
that.
these
two
petitioners
escorted
the
lyons
family...
i
have
to
back
up.
there
were
actually
two
different
drives
off
the
road.
after
the
car
was
stopped...
during
which,
by
the
way,
everyone
had
guns
except
the
man,
raymond,
who
was
standing
on
the
road.
and
he
says
somewhere
in
the
statement,
i
couldn't
have
carried
a
gun
then
because
it
would
have
been
suspicious.
but
everybody
else...
they
were
astride
the
road...
had
guns.
they
came
out
after
the
car
was
stopped
with
the
guns
drawn.
the
first
little
side
trip
that
was
made
was
then
made,
i
think
the
record
indicates,
of
the
trial
testimony,
about
seven-tenths
of
a
mile
off
of
that
highway.
from
there,
once
the
cars
were
stopped
and
the
exchange
of
goods
between
the
lincoln
and
the
mazda
was
going
on,
another
little
drive
of
the
lincoln
was
taken,
50
or
75
yards
away
from
that
spot.
now,
raymond
did
that
driving.
again,
he
says,
at
the
request
of
my
father,
i
drove
the
lincoln
over
to
that
spot
50,
75
yards
away.
after
that,
this
family,
who
was
standing
back
and
forth
in
various
places,
were
escorted
to
the
lincoln
by
everyone
with
guns
drawn.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
at
one
spot
in
the
statement,
ricky
says,
we
always
had
those
guns.
and
i
would
also
dispute,
i
believe,
a
point
mr.
dershowitz
made
that
the
boys
only
had
handguns
at
the
time.
i
believe
the
record
will
show
you
that
during
the
prison
break,
ricky
had
a
shotgun,
which
he
pointed
at
the
guard
behind
the
glass
wall.
pointed
it
at
him,
and
as
another
one
came
in
the
room,
he
pointed
it
at
him.
and
i
believe
the
statements
by
ricky
and
raymond
would
show
you,
throughout
they
were
armed,
whether
it
was
with
small
guns
or
with
shotguns
at
various
times,
we
can't
tell.
now,
in
this
case,
in
answer
to
your
question,
there
was
something
else
that
was
done
by
each
of
those.
and
to
me,
it's
very
crucial.
they,
with
arms
at
side,
escorted
these
people
into
the
lincoln.
and
that
is
where
the
discussion
took
place:
leave
us
with
some
water.
we
can
stay
here
until
tomorrow
afternoon.
they
escorted
these
people,
and
our
supreme
court
points
that
out,
to
the
killing
ground.
that's
where
they
were
killed.
they
escorted
them
into
the
lincoln.
after
that
was
when
ricky
stood
back
and
watched.
he
then
watched
the
killing.
now,
i
believe
that
is
different
than
the
scenario
given
me
where
they
walk
off.
it
does
add
quite
a
bit.
and
our
supreme
court,
i
submit
to
you--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--oh,
it
certainly
does.
because
part
of
what
went
on...
i
just
gave
you
the
overall--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--i
believe
under
enmund
it
is.
killed,
attempted
to
kill...
they
did
not
kill
or
attempt
to
kill.
i
have
to
admit
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
question.
the
question
then
would
be
if
their
participation--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--well,
i
have
a
difficult
time
accepting
that
fact.
but
assuming--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--no,
i
believe
i
could
still
make
a
reasonable
argument
under
enmund
that
these
two
petitioners
contemplated
that
lethal
force
would
be
used.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
we
have
to
remember
that
this
entire
incident
took
place
over
11
or
12
days,
it's
debatable,
from
july
30
until
august
11,
possibly
12
days.
the
individuals--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--i...
the
way
i
read
this
opinion,
it
reads
no
other
way
than
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
convinced
these
individuals
were
not
surprised
and
they
knew
what
was
about
to
happen.
and
i
believe
that
you
will
see
most
of
that
at
page
346
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
arizona
supreme
court
goes
through,
in
the
top
five-sixths
of
that
page,
one
fact
after
another
which,
to
me,
leads
to
the--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--with
either
reading?
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
i
don't
read
them
as
consistent
with,
that
they
were
surprised,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
the
first
paragraph,
thus
petitioner
could
anticipate...
and
he's
only
talking
about
one
boy
here...
the
use
of
lethal
force
during
his
attempt
to
flee
confinement.
he
then
points
out
that
either
or
both
of
them
actually,
although
he's
only
talking
about
one,
were
ready
to
use
the
guns.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
i
just
led
that...
was
leading
into
the
next
paragraph.
and
the
way
i
read
that,
no.
they
would
say
to
you...
although
they
don't
say
it
specifically
in
the
opinion,
they
were
not
surprised.
but
i
would
follow
up
by
saying,
i
still
believe
you
could
make...
i
could...
a
reasonable
argument
that
under
enmund,
these
two
individuals
anticipated
or
contemplated
that
lethal
force
would
be
used.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
your
honor,
i,
first
of
all,
would
disagree
that
they
went
to
get
the
water.
but
if
i
were
to
concede
that,
that
they
both
went
to
get
the
water
and
during
that
absence
the
killings
took
place,
what
i
would
say
to
you
is,
as
i've
said
in
the
brief,
ricky
tison
says
in
his
statements
that
i
heard...
i'm
paraphrasing
again,
of
course...
gary
tison,
the
father,
say
that
i'm
thinking
about
killing
this
family.
that's
what
ricky
says
in
his
statement.
raymond
tison
says
that
he
could
see
that
his
father
was
going
through
turmoil,
although
that
may
not
be
his
word.
and
raymond
thought
that
perhaps
it
was
because
the
baby
was
there,
this
22-month
old
baby.
both
of
those
petitioners,
ricky
because
he
heard
his
father
say
that,
that
i'm
thinking
of
killing
this
family,
and
raymond
because
he
saw
him
thinking
about
something
as
awful
as
that,
he
knew
that
something
was
going
on
with
his
father.
now
i
believe--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--well--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--if
we
limit
it
to
the
scene,
i
was
about
to
say,
if
you're
talking
just
about
the
scene.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
and
i
believe
that
that
happened
before
raymond
says
that
gary
tison
said,
go
get
the
water.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
all
right,
after
he--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--if
we
limit
it
to
them--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--oh,
we
have
conceded
that.
i
do.
their
participation
in
the
firing
of
the
gun
was
zero.
they
did
not,
and
the
record
will
not
show
you,
that
they
pulled
those
triggers
with
at
all.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
they're
charged
with
murder.
however,
the
record--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--this
is
true.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
dispute
that
they
did
not
anticipate--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--i
can't
stand
here
today
and
tell
you
that
they
knew...
knew...
that
at
that
time
that
trigger
would
be
pulled.
except
i
refer
again
to
ricky's
statement--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--oh,
i
didn't
think
you
had
finished
that
question,
your
honor.
the
second
and
the
third
issues,
in
this
case,
to
me,
are
whether
enmund
prohibits
a
death
sentence
for
a
non-trigger
man,
and
what
does
this
court
do
with
the
state
court
finding
that
enmund
has
been
satisfied.
now,
if
this
were
a
habeas
corpus
action,
i
would
answer
the
last
question
by
saying
that
you
should
accord
the
state
court
finding
a
presumption
of
correctness.
that
is
what
the
habeas
corpus
statute
says,
and
that
is
what
this
court
said,
i
believe,
in
cabana
v.
bullock.
this
is
not
a
habeas
corpus
action.
but
for
the
purposes
that
we
are
now
discussing,
i
really
don't
believe
it
makes
any
difference.
over
and
above
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
this
court
has
said
that
it
pays
great
deference
to
state
court
findings,
factual
findings.
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
i
think,
merely
incorporates
that
principle.
for
the
reason
stated
in
cabana,
a
state
court
finding
should
be
accorded
great
weight,
whether
it
makes
its
way
to
this
court
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
or
some
other
method.
therefore,
the
state
court
finding
in
this
case,
which
was
a
finding
of
intent
to
kill
according
to
the
definition
as
stated
on
page
345,
i
believe
it
is,
should
be
accorded
great
weight,
and
should
not
be
overturned
unless
this
court
can
say
that
the
finding
is
not
fairly
supported
by
the
record,
which
is
really
also
out
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
can
say
that
on
this
record.
throughout
these
proceedings,
there
has
been
little
or
no
dispute
that
raymond
and
ricky
tison
planned
the
escape;
that
they
gathered
the
guns;
they
gathered
the
cars;
and
they
gathered
the
ammunition
to
do
it.
to
effect
that
escape,
they
used
those
guns
as
they
needed
them.
and
they,
with
the
others,
kidnapped
the
lyons
family
at
gunpoint.
they
went
through
the
belongings
of
the
lyons
family,
and
they
took
what
they
needed
to
continue
the
escape,
including
the
car.
and
then,
with
the
others,
by
using
the
guns
they
had
gathered,
they
herded
the
lyons
into
the
lincoln
to
be
killed.
now,
all
of
these
facts
are
in
the
various
statements
of
both
of
the
petitioners.
the
only
thing
that
has
been
disputed
is
what
these
two
knew
about
the
killings
before
they
actually
occurred.
they
say
they
were
caught
by
surprise.
we
believe
that
the
state
court
is
rather
clear
in
its
finding
that
they
believe
they
were
not
caught
by
surprise;
that
they
knew
what
was
about
to
happen;
they
knew
that
gary
tison
was
considering
killing
the
family.
raymond
tison
said
he
knew
his
father
was
mulling
that
over
in
his
mind.
and
ricky
said
he
heard
his
father
say
that
he
was
thinking
about
killing
the
family.
and
after
that,
ricky
said,
they
stood
back.
they
went
back
to
the
ground
they
had
been
occupying
before,
the
ground
from
which
they
ushered
the
family
into
the
lincoln,
and
from
there,
ricky
says,
they
watched
as
the
family
was
killed
with
a
great
many
shotgun
blasts.
ricky
and
raymond
tison
were
as
much
a
part
of
what
happened
as
anyone
else.
they,
with
the
others,
decided
to
kidnap
and
rob.
and
they
with
the
others
kidnapped
the
lyons
family
at
gunpoint.
they
went
through
the
belongings.
they
robbed
at
gunpoint.
and
then,
once
they
had
taken
what
they
needed,
they
stood
by
as
the
accomplices
did
the
actual
killing.
up
until
the
shots
were
fired,
the
participation
of
one
was
the
participation
of
all.
in
the
plot
to
get
away,
each
participated
equally.
and
each
did
his
part
to
prepare
for
those
killings.
in
the
sense
that
the
model
penal
code
uses
the
word
"cause",
the
conduct
of
these
two
was
a
cause
of
the
result
because
they
contemplated
the
harm,
and
they
contemplated
that
lethal
force
would
be
used.
they
simply
did
not
know
that
the
lyons
would
be
the
ones
who
were
the
result
of
that
harm.
these--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--i
don't
want
to
use
the
word,
"foresaw",
but--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--i
think
it
probably
is
a
difference
only
in
degree,
your
honor.
and
in
answer
to
i
believe
it
was
some
of
your
questions
of
mr.
dershowitz,
if
i
was
standing
here,
i
would
have
said,
i
don't
know
if
i
would
speculate
on
a
definition
of
foresee
in
this
instance.
i
would
go
back
to
the
language
that
you
used
in
enmund,
and
that
our
supreme
court
was
parroting
in
their
opinion.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
specifically
the
quote
that
mr.
dershowitz
gave
you
from
enmund...
here
it
is:
it
would
be
very
different
in
the
likelihood
of
a
killing
in
the
course
of
a
robbery
were
so
substantial
that
one
should
share
the
blame
for
the
killing
if
he
somehow
participated
in
the
felony.
period.
that's
the
language
which
appears
on
779,
i
believe,
of
458.
and
i
think
that
this
court--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--yes.
so
substantial.
those
were
the
words
i
was
really
trying
to
underline
with
my
words.
but
i
believe
you
qualify
that
language
when
you
said
the
likelihood
of
a
killing
is
so
substantial--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
very
well
can
be.
and
here
i
believe
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
saying...
although
they
did
not
use
any
language
from
the
model
penal
code
as
i
have;
but
to
me,
that's
what
they
were
saying.
and
they
do
have
a
reference
on
a
page
that's
been
quoted
from
already,
page
346
in
the
joint
appendix,
that
these
people
may
not
have
seen
that
these
particular
people
were
going
to
be
killed,
but
they
knew,
contemplated,
that
there
would
be
harm
resulting
from
what
they
had
done
and
what
they
participated
in.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
these
particular
ones.
and
i
believe
that
gets
back
to
the
initial
question
that
mr.
dershowitz
was
asked
about
specific
intent.
if
you
go
back
to
the
first
arizona
supreme
court
opinion,
where
they
use
the
word,
specifically,
i
believe
as
i
read
that
opinion,
that
is
what
justice
struckmeyer
said,
a
different
justice
than
wrote
the
second
opinion.
he
was
saying
that
although
the
record
may
not
show
that
they
had
a
specific
intent
to
kill
these
specific
persons,
that
does
not
make
any
difference.
although
he
doesn't
go
as
far
as
to
talk
about
intent.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
don't
believe
it
was
an
essential
ingredient
of
either
of
those.
i
believe
it
is
much
more
arguable
that
it
was
practical,
an
essential
agreement
to
effect
a
safe
escape.
and
there
is
one
statement
that...
i
believe
it
is
raymond
now...
says
that
with
his
father,
it
was
a
matter
of
no
survivals.
and
he
says,
he
summarizes
most
everything
that
went
on
out
there
by
saying,
and
this
is
almost
a
direct
quote:
we
all
knew
the
odds
that
we
were
playing
with
out
there.
and
i
believe
that
summarizes
a
good
deal
of
what
happened.
they
knew
the
odds.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
the
odds
were
that
they
would
conceivably
end
up
with
a
death
sentence
because
someone
could
easily
have
killed,
as
is
what
happened.
thank
you,
mr.
schafer.
