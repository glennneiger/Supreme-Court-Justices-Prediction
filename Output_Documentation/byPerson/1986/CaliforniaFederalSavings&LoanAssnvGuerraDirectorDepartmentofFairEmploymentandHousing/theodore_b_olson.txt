mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
after
that
court
reversed
a
district
court
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
petitioners.
this
case
presents
a
conflict
between
two
statutes.
federal
law
forbids
employers
to
discriminate
for
any
employment
purpose
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
california
law,
on
the
other
hand,
requires
employers
to
provide
special
job
protections
to
employees
disabled
by
pregnancy.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
mandate
of
equal
protection
prevails
over
the
state
policy
of
special
protection.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
as
amended
by
the
1978
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
the
pda,
makes
it
an
unlawful
employment
practice
to
discriminate
against
any
individual
on
the
basis
of
sex,
including
pregnancy.
the
pda
expressly
requires
that
women
affected
by
pregnancy
shall
be
treated
the
same
for
all
employment-related
purposes
as
persons
experiencing
other
disabilities
similarly
affecting
their
ability
to
work.
petitioners
comply
with
title
vii
by
implementing
employment
policies
which
treat
pregnancy
exactly
the
same
as
other
temporary
conditions
which
might
affect
an
employee's
ability
to
work.
such
policies
vary,
but
as
relevant
here,
do
not
provide
immediate
guaranteed
reinstatement
rights
on
return
from
disability.
in
contrast,
california's
statute
requires
employers
to
grant
up
to
four
months'
leave
for
pregnancy,
with
a
right
to
return
to
the
same
or
similar
position.
as
respondents'
brief
puts
it,
and
summarizes
the
california
requirement,
the
california
statute
guarantees
reasonable
unpaid
leave
and
reinstatement
of
female
employees
disabled
by
pregnancy;
and
thus
ensures
that
pregnancy
disability
will
not
cause
female
employees
to
lose
their
jobs.
petitioners'
declaratory
relief
action
was
resolved
in
district
court
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
based
on
stipulated
facts.
the
district
court
ruled
for
petitioners,
concluding
that
the
state
law
requires
preferential
treatment
for
female
employees,
and
was
therefore
inconsistent
with,
and
preempted
by,
title
vii.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
there
are
two
basic
conflicts
presented
by
this
case.
in
summary,
they
are
as
follows.
one,
the
equal
treatment
versus
special
treatment
issue.
petitioner,
along
with
the
united
states,
the
national
organization
of
women,
the
united
states
chamber
of
commerce,
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
and
numerous
others
contend
that
federal
law
categorically
and
unambiguously
forbids
pregnancy
discrimination
and
requires
that
employers
treat
pregnancy
on
the
same
basis
as
other
temporary
disabilities.
california
adheres
to
a
diametrically
opposed
philosophy,
that
pregnancy
requires
that
women
be
treated
differently
in
order
that
may
be
treated
equally.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
is
in
theory
one
way
to
approach
it.
and
it
is
theoretically
possible,
as
you
suggest.
we
submit
that
that
is
an
end
run,
as
the
united
states
put
it
in
their
brief,
around
the
extension
versus
validation
issue,
which
is
the
same...
which
is
the
second
issue
that
i
was
going
to
mention
and
summarize;
that
in
essence,
it
would
require
employers
to
bring
up
the
benefits
that
they
are
required
by
california
law
to
give
to
female
employees
who
are
pregnant,
to
all
employees
suffering
any
disability
that
would
take
them
away
from
work.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
how
would...
you
would
do
it
by
adopting
a
leave
policy
that
would
guarantee
reinstatement
to
work.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
up
to
four
months,
the
statute--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
thrust
of
justice
o'connor's
question,
and
the
argument
that
has
been
presented
by
some
of
the
participants
in
this
litigation,
is
that
there
isn't
tension
between
title
vii
and
the
california
statute
because
the
california
statute
mandates
treatment
for
pregnancy
in
a
certain
way.
and
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
to
give
that
same
treatment
to
all
people
for
all
disabilities.
our
response
to
that,
in
addition
to
what
i've
already
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--all
disabilities...
well,
it
would
have...
any...
as
i
understand
the
thrust
of
title
vii,
as
amended
by
the
pregnancy
disability
act,
it
requires
that
all
disabilities
be
treated
the
same
based
upon
comparableness
in
terms
of
the
ability
or
inability
to
work.
so
that
if
a
broken
foot,
an
open
heart
surgery,
whatever
it
might
be,
would
take
you
off
for
a
week
or
a
month
or
two
months--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--of
course.
but
pregnancy
disabilities
will
also
vary.
they
may
be
one
week.
they
may
be
two
weeks.
they
may
be
six
weeks.
they
may
be
eight
weeks.
as
i
understand
the
california
statute,
it
does
not
mandate
automatically
four
months
in
every
case.
it
requires
an
as-necessary
judgment
based
upon
the
amount
of
leave
necessary
for
the
individual.
if
we
were
to
comply
with
the
theoretical
suggestion
that
you
make
that
benefit
to
all
employees,
it
would
be
for
all
disabilities.
it
would
have
to
be
adjusted
on
any
particular
basis,
as
far
as
the
length
of
time
was
concerned.
but
the
reinstatement
right
would
have
to
be
guaranteed.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
that
is
exactly
what
is
involved.
as
the
respondents
state
that
in
their
brief,
it
is
the
right
to
engage
in
reproductive
activity,
and
not
lose
your
job.
or
the
guaranteed
right
to
not
sustain
the
loss
of
a
job
as
a
result
of
a
pregnancy
disability.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
thrust
of
the
requirement
of
the
california
statute
is
that
the
job
remain
open.
if
you
have
to
take
leave
because
of
pregnancy,
title
vii
specifically
requires
that
women
affected
by
pregnancy
shall
be
treated
the
same
for
all
employment-related
purposes
as
other
persons
not
so
affected
but
similar
in
their
ability
or
inability
to
work.
we
submit
that
the...
this
continues
to,
in
part,
respond
to
justice
o'connor's
question...
but
that
the
federal
statute...
and
in
addition,
summarizes
the
first
issue
in
this
case...
is
that
the
federal
statute
clearly
mandates
that
pregnancy
be
treated
the
same
as
other
disabilities.
when
this
legislation
was
considered
in
the
congress--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--as
i
read
the
statute,
justice
o'connor,
and
as
i
have
read
the
legislative
history,
in
the
context
in
which
this
statute
was
passed,
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
suggested,
we
must
start
with
the
words
of
the
statute
themselves,
and
give
them
the
meaning...
or
that
the
words
would
ordinarily
be
susceptible
to:
women
affected
by
pregnancy
shall
be
treated
the
same
for
all
employment-related
purposes
as
other
persons
not
so
affected,
but
similar
in
their
ability
and
inability
to
work.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
suppose
we
wouldn't
be
here
unless
there
was
some
debate
on
the
other
side
of
that
question.
at
least
the
parties
on
the
other
side
of
this
case
have
made
the
argument
that
the
statute
does
not,
in
fact,
say
what
to
me
is
its
plain
meaning.
but
to
the
extent
that
it's
necessary
to
go
to
the
context
in
which
the
statute
was
passed,
and
the
legislative
history
which
led
up
to
the
passage
of
the
statute,
those
produce
for
me,
for
the
petitioners,
the
same
result.
this
statute
was
passed
in
the
context
of
title
vii,
and
against
a
backdrop
of
a
concept
that
special
protections,
given
to
women,
over
the
decades
and
the
centuries,
in
this
country
and
elsewhere,
while
intended
beneficially
to
help
women,
have
turned
out
to
be...
to
inhibit
women
in
the
workplace.
they've
created
the
same
type
of
stigma
and
stereotype
which
have
been
so
damaging
to
other
groups
which
have
been
selected
out
for
special
classification.
congress
specifically
recognized
the
fact
that
that
kind
of
stereotype
that
had
occurred
was
damaging
to
women.
in
a
sense,
the
idea
of
shorter
hours
for
women,
special
protections
for
women--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there's
no
question
that
it
was--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
was
the
immediate
cause
of
it.
but
of
course
it
was
against
the
backdrop
of
centuries,
and
more
immediately,
decades
of
legislation
which
had
provided
special
protection
to
women
which
had
been
determined
by
many
individuals,
including
many
women's
organizations,
as
ultimately
destructive
to
women
because
they
put
the
image
of
women
inside
this
stereotype
that
somehow
women
needed
to
have
extra
special
protection
in
order
to
be
brought
up
to
the
level
of
men.
the
best
way
to
put
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
your
opinion,
justice
o'connor,
for
the
court
in
the
mississippi
university
case
was
that
if
the...
and
this
is
a
different
situation,
but
the
words
i
think
are
appropriate...
that
if
the
statutory
objective
is
to
protect
members
of
one
gender
because
they
are
presumed
to
suffer
from
an
inherent
handicap,
or
to
be
innately
inferior,
the
objective
is
illegitimate.
the
american
civil
liberties
union
has
said
the
same
thing
in
its
brief,
and
i
think
better
put
than
anything
that
i
could
say.
in
referring
to
what
the
state
of
california
calls
its
disparate
impact
analysis,
which
is
in
the
state's
brief,
the
american
civil
liberties
responded
to
that
in
footnote
30
on
page
24
of
their
brief
with
these
words:
it
is
troublesome
that
without
proof
the
state
is
willing
to
confirm
what
has
been
said
all
along
by
the
practitioners
of
discrimination,
that
pregnancy
renders
women
less
reliable,
less
productive
employees,
absent
more
often,
more
expensive;
that
is
to
say,
fundamentally
different
and
handicapped.
that
is
the
backdrop
against
which
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
was
enacted.
and
of
course
it
was
the
gilbert
case
that
was
the
immediate
impetus
for
congress
to
pass
that
legislation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
concrete
situation...
and
i
alluded
to
this
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
initial
question,
is
that
it
would
require
the
change
of
cal
fed's...
the
addition
of
cal
fed's
policy,
and
all
other
employees
of
the
state
of
california,
with
respect
to
every
disability,
their
leave
policy.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
would
have
to
be
charged
to
guarantee
the
right
of
reinstatement
in
the
same
way
that
that's
guaranteed
by
the
state
of
california
and
as
set
forth
in
their
policy
as
interpreted
by
the
agency
interpreting
it.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
employers
policies
vary,
as
you
might
understand,
all
across
the
lot.
some
employers,
depending
on
their
size,
might
indeed
give
employees
the
right
to
return
to
the
job
if
the
job
is
open.
the
california
statute
imposes
a
rebuttal
presumption
that
the
precise
same
job
may
be
held
open
for
the
individual
upon
the
individual's
return.
and
if
for
some
business
necessity,
which
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
prove
in
california
under
the
regulatory
standards,
that
job
isn't
available,
then
resort
must
be
had
to
finding
a
similar
job.
other
employers
in
the
state
of
california
vary
their
relief
policies,
and
will
make
appropriate
adjustments
to
persons
returning
from
a
broken
foot
or
a
heart
attack
or
pregnancy
based
on
what
the
circumstances
that
prevail
at
that
particular
employer
are.
but
there
is
no
guaranteed
statutorily
mandated
and
statutorily
enforced
right
to
return
to
the
same
job
as
california--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--california
federal's
policy,
which
is
set
forth
on
the
joint
appendix
at
page
40,
is
to
provide
reasonable
leave
for
employees
for
pregnancy
or
for
other
disabilities
or
for
personal
leave
up
to
six
months,
on
the
basis
of
the
needs
of
the
individual
employee.
and
cal
fed
will
attempt
to
find
the
employee
a
job
to
return
to,
but
does
not
guarantee
reinstatement.
and
the
other
petitioners,
which
are
thousands
of
california
employers,
have
varying
degrees
of
reinstatement
policies,
none
of
which
comport
necessarily
with
the
requirement
of
california
that
it
be
a
guaranteed
return
to
the
same
position.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
they
would
have
to
adopt
a
california
policy.
and
the
other
aspect
of
the
answer
to
the
question,
if
one
looks
at
the
practical
consequences,
if
suppose
california,
as
it
does,
requires
the
reinstatement
of
the
employee,
and
if
an
employer
decides
voluntarily
to
reinstate
other
employees,
and
if
suppose
a
pregnant
employee
and
a
person
returning
from
a
bypass
surgery
arrived
back
at
the
same
day,
and
if
suppose
circumstances,
economics,
any
situation
might
occur
that
there's
only
one
job
available
at
that
particular
time,
now,
which
person
is
the
employer
going
to
give
the
job
back
to?
under
the
california
statute
if
that
exists
and
the
employer
is
in
california,
the
employer
is
going
to
prefer
the
employee
returning
from
pregnancy.
that
is
the
effect
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
question,
i
should
say,
that
the
california
authorities
recognize
that
their
statute
is
different--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that's
theoretically
correct.
there
may
only
be
one
job,
which
means
that
the
employer
will
have
to
create
another
job.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
with
the
limitations
that
are
built
into
the
statute
from
a
standpoint--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
the
practical
effect
of
that,
justice
stevens,
is
that
these
situations
in
the
real
world,
and
we're
talking
about
thousands
of
employers
and
large
workforces
and
so
forth,
are
going
to
differ
when
one
statute...
the
whole
california
mechanism
for
enforcement,
to
bring
actions
and
provide
penalties
and
so
forth,
requires
that
you
treat
the
pregnant
employee
a
certain
way,
and
the
employer
is
deciding
to
voluntarily
give
certain
rights
to
other
employees,
it
should
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
would
create
practical
problems,
because
you
would
have--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--california
would
have
the
responsibility
to
enforce
the
federal
law,
as
it
does,
as
well
as
the
state
law.
its
own
state
law
requires
it
to
separate
out...
it
is
decided
that
pregnant
returning
employees
are
a
favored
class.
california
itself
says
that
its
requirements
exceed
and
go
beyond--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
if...
let's
suppose--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--let's
take
that
example,
that
the
state
of
california
decided
that
people
of
asian
background
be,
for
whatever
reasons
the
california
legislature
might
select,
should
have
a
different
minimum
wage,
a
higher
minimum
wage
than
presently
prevails
in
california.
i
do
not...
i
submit
that
the
decision
by
california
to
select
out
a
group
of
people
on
the
basis
of
race
or
nationality
or
religion
or
any
other
basis
for
preferential
treatment,
and
then
put
the
weight
of
the
state
of
california
behind
that
treatment,
you're
right
in
the
sense
that
everybody
could
say,
well,
now
we've
got
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
for
everyone
else
as
well.
but
the
state
of
california
will
have
been
selecting
out
a
group
to
put
itself
behind.
now
i
must
say--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--title...
well,
section
708
of
title
vii
in
fact
suggests,
states,
that
employers
are
exempt
from
requirements
imposed
by
the
state
of...
by
the
states,
if
the
state
permits
or
requires
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
the
state
of
california
is
stating
that
you
must
treat
pregnant
individuals
in
a
certain
way--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--when
the
full
force,
i
submit,
of
the
state
of
california
comes
out
and
selects
a
group
on
what
has
been
determined
in
title
vii
by
the
national
legislature
to
be
an
impermissible
basis
for
classification,
then
they're
selecting--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
section
704...
it
isn't
a
leap,
that
section
704
of
title
vii,
and
section
1104
of
title
xi
specifically
make
that
link,
that
what
is
happening
here
is
the
state
of
california
is
authorizing
or
permitting
employers
to
provide
specific
benefits
to
one
class
of
individuals.
and
i
should
go
on
to
say--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
submit
that
when
a
state
government
selects
out
a
class
of
individuals
and
determines
that
those
individuals
shall
have
certain
benefits,
and
sets
up
an
enforcement
mechanism
for
that
purpose,
that
that
is
special
treatment.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
it
does
not.
we
submit
that
section
704,
the
preemption
provision
of
title
vii,
specifically
refers
to
laws
of
the
states
which
purport
to
require
or
permit
the
doing
of
any
act
which
would
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
under
title
vii.
in
addition,
section
704
says
that
the
federal
statute
preempts
any
provision
of
state
law
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
this
act
or
the
provisions
thereof.
now,
we
submit
that
the
selection
by
the
state
of
california
of
a
racial
group,
and
stating
that
that
particular
group
cannot
work
certain
hours
or
need
not
be
bartenders,
or
must
get
special
benefits
in
the
workplace,
is
a
provision
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
and
provisions
of
title
vii,
and
the
philosophy
of
title
vii,
which
is,
that
we
must
eliminate
stereotypes--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
agree
with
that.
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
unless
i
missed
some
element
of
your
question,
i
believe
that
california
definitely
could
do
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
exactly,
and
that
bill,
ab
3340,
was
in
fact
introduced,
and
was
pending
before
the
california
legislature,
and
the
california
legislature
adjourned
this
year
without
its
passage.
in
fact,
a
bill
which
on
the
national
level
would
accomplish
the
leave
of
absence
and
the
right
to
return
has
been
pending
in
congress
for
some
period
of
time,
and
has
not
been
passed.
so
the
legislature
can
deal
with
these
problems.
and
if
that
is
an
appropriate
solution,
that
is
the
appropriate
place
for
it
to
occur.
because
i
submit
that
a
leave
policy--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
could
be
the
case,
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
could
be
the
basis
for
what
is
happening
in
congress.
but
the
legislative
history
of
the
pregnancy
disability
act
is
replete
with
references,
over
and
over
again,
by
members
of
the
legislature,
saying,
what
is
the
pregnancy
disability
act
going
to
accomplish?
is
it
going
to
require
employees...
employers
to
adopt
leave
programs,
to
adopt
disability
benefits,
is
it
going
to
require
that?
and
the
testimony...
congress
is
often,
as
we're
all
aware,
is
often
inscrutable.
the
legislative
history
is
usually
mixed
in
one
way
or
another.
in
this
case,
the
legislative
history
is
uniform
and
absolutely
clear
that
the
addition
of
leave
programs
or
disability
benefits
was
not
going
to
be
a
requirement
that
resulted
from
the
adoption
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
the
legislature
is
quite
clear
there.
and
thus
an
extension
of
any
sort--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is
clear
to
me
from
the
legislative
history
that
that
is
exactly
what--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
those...
the
same
question,
in
virtually
those
same
words,
was
asked
and
answered
in
various
different
ways
during
the
hearings,
in
the
committee
reports,
and
in
various
different
ways.
ultimately,
of
course...
thus,
any
kind
of
an
extension
of
the
benefits
that
california
has
determined
should
be
available
to
a
certain
class
of
individuals
would
be
something
that
was
inconsistent
with
what
the
congress
of
the
united
states
thought
it
was
accomplishing
when
it
adopted
the
pregnancy
disability
act.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
what
california
itself
is
urging.
because
the
state
of
california,
in
its
brief
here
today,
says
that
it
is
not
in
favor
of
extension;
it
does
not
think
that's
necessary.
the
california
supreme
court
has
said,
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
extension,
as
opposed
to
invalidation,
that
it
is
a
drastic
alternative
that
should
be
resorted
to
only
when
there
is
clear
evidence
to
support
that
the
legislature
intended
that
outcome.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
suspect
that's
why
the
state
of...
the
united
states
in
its
brief
called
it,
an
extension,
an
end
run.
because
it
would
be
a
declaration
by
this
court
that
the
effect
of
the
existence
of
the
california
statute
and
the
federal
statute,
in
tandem,
is
to
require
exactly
what
the
congress
of
the
united
states
thought
it
was
not
accomplishing,
what
the
california
legislature,
the
california
courts,
and
the
california
executive
branch
don't
seem
to
want,
don't
seem
to
be
in
favor
of.
it
would
be
imposing
costs
and
burdens
on
california
employers
that
may
affect
seniority
policies;
it
may
affect
the
economics
of
the
employers
in
the
state
of
california;
it
may
affect
whether
employers
in
the
state
of
california
can
compete
as
well
with
other
employers
elsewhere.
in
other
words,
those
are
legislative
judgments--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
all
of
the
examples
that
i
have
read,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
has
ever
been
an
outcome...
to
the
extent
that
i've
been
able
to
find
one...
in
this
court
which
would
come
to
that
conclusion,
would
be
a
very
narrow
extension
under
very
narrow
circumstances.
california
acknowledges
in
its
brief
on
page
41
that
the
policy
enunciated
by
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
that
pregnancy
be
treated
like
any
other
disability,
had
been
in
operation
in
22
states
prior
to
the
pda's
passage
in
1978.
it
says
in
its
brief:
many
states
then
were
ahead
of
the
federal
government
in
adopting
an
important
social
policy.
the
same
can
be
said
today
of
the
maternity
leave
policies
of
california,
massachusetts,
and
so
forth.
in
other
words,
california
recognizes
that
with
respect
to
an
important
social
policy,
it
is
ahead
of
the
federal
government.
because
that
important
social
policy
involves
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
a
class
determined
by
congress
not
to
be
a
permissible
basis
for
discrimination,
if
there
is
to
be
such
a
change,
we
submit
it
should
be
done
by
congress.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
is
about
assumptions
regarding
groups.
the
united
states
congress
decided
that
assumptions
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
were
impermissible
in
the
workforce.
california
has
made
an
assumption
about
pregnant
individuals
that
they
need
some
extra
assistance
in
order
to
be
equalized
in
the
workplace.
the
effect
of
the
california
statute
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
law.
the
purpose
of
the
california
statute
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
the
federal
law.
and
the
philosophy
of
the
california
statute
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
statute.
the
federal
law,
and
congress,
throughout
the
legislative
history
in
hearings
relative
to
this
matter,
assumed
that
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
was
wrong.
the
assumption
here
in
part
of
this
debate
has
been
that
there's
some
sort
of
favorable
discrimination
going
on
in
the
state
of
california.
congress
assumed,
and
stated,
that
discrimination
was
wrong;
and
that
there
is
no,
in
this
context,
favorable
discrimination.
because
it
requires
and
causes
people
to
have
assumptions
about
groups.
it
is
the
point
that
the
aclu
is
making
in
footnote
30
which
i
read,
and
i
believe
it's
the
point
that
justice
o'connor
was
making
for
the
court
in
the
mississippi
university
case,
that
those
assumptions
about
groups,
that
they
need
some
extra
help,
in
order
to
be
equal
with
everyone
else,
ultimately
causes
damage.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
congress
addressed
the
means
of
providing
that
assistance.
i'm
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--california
enacted
its
statute
shortly
before
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
but
it
was
not
effective
until
after,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
but
i
believe
that
congress
selected
the
means
to
solve
that
problem.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
before
the
california
statute
became
effective.
