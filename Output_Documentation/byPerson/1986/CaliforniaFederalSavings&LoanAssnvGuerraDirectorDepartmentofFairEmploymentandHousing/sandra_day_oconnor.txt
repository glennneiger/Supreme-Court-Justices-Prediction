justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
olson,
i
guess
in
theory,
an
employer
could
comply
with
the
california
state
law
by
offering
female
employees
the
pregnancy
leave,
and
comply
with
title
vii
by
offering
comparable
leave
to
other
disabled
employees.
and
if
that
is
the
case,
how
is
the
california
law
preemptive?
i
guess
in
theory
that's
certainly
one
way
to
approach
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
it?
can
an
employer
discriminate,
for
instance,
in
granting
leave
for
other
health
problems?
what
about
somebody
with
heart
problems?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
may
be
a
remedial
provision.
it
may
tell
you
what
should
happen
in
the
event
an
employer
does
treat
a
pregnant
employee
differently.
i
just
don't
think
it's
that
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
how
far
it
reaches.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
to
be
more
specific,
it
was
passed
in
response
to
this
court's
opinion
in
gilbert.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that
was
the
immediate
cause
of
the
passage
of
this
act,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
olson,
the
statute
in
california
does
not
prevent
an
employer
from
extending
benefits
to
other
employees
on
a
similar
basis,
and
in
comparable
situations,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
olson,
i
suppose,
though,
that
whenever
state
law
and
federal
law
operate
in
the
same
field,
as
under
a
scheme
like
this,
where
congress
has
said
states
may
legislate,
the
result
of
the
combination
may
be
one
that
isn't
entirely
intended
by
either
the
state
or
congress.
i
guess
we
have
some
other
examples
of
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
insert
the
word
"pregnancy"
in
the
statute,
i
suppose
the
federal
act
would
then
say
that
women
affected
by
pregnancy
shall
be
treated
the
same
as
other
persons
not
so
affected
but
similar
in
their
ability
or
inability
to
work.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
of
course,
their
argument,
then,
is
that
would
require
employers
to
give
all
similarly
disabled
workers
the
same
benefits
it
gives
pregnant
workers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
your
position
that
an
employer,
even
absent
california
state
law,
an
employer
who
does
not
provide
reasonable
pregnancy
leave
would
be
in
violation
of
title
vii.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that
your
position,
if
we
were
faced
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
your
argument
of
a
disparate
treatment
analysis
would
lead
to
that
result,
would
it
not?
