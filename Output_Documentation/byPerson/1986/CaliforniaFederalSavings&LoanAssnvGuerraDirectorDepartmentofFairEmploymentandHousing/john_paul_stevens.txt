mr.
olson,
is
it
quite
fair
to
justice
o'connor's
question
to
say,
for
all
disabilities,
or
for
all
comparable
disabilities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
would
take
you
off
for
a
week.
let's
say
you
had
a
broken
foot
that
took
you
off
for
two
hours;
or
a
sprained
ankle
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
let
me
just
ask
you
a
question
about
that
example
again.
it,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
suggestion,
you
say
both
statutes
apply,
i
suppose
the
employer
would
have
to
give
both
of
those
people
jobs,
and
then
there'd
be
no
violation
of
either
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
the
california
statute,
if
we
didn't
have
title
vii,
there
might
be
no
job;
and
you'd
still
have
to
make
one
available,
wouldn't
you?
maybe
i
misunderstand
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it's
the
same
problem.
i
mean
the
difference
between
zero
and
one,
and
one
and
two,
is
exactly
the
same,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
your
hypothesis...
under
your
hypothesis,
i
think
you're
assuming
that
the
federal
statute
applies
and
requires
equal
treatment,
requires
that
the
male
who
has
just
had
a
bypass
operation
coming
back
at
the
same
time
as
a
female
who
just
had
a
child
must
be
treated
alike.
and
the
minimum
treatment
for
them
is
defined
by
the
california
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
title
vii
created
a
lot
of
practical
problems.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
statute
doesn't
require
that
they
be
treated
as
a
favored
class.
it
just...
supposing
we
had
a
minimum
wage...
and
it
might
well
be
unconstitutional...
but
supposing
we
had
a
minimum
wage
for
male
elevator
operators
that
was
higher
than
the
prevailing
wage
elsewhere.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
johnston,
can
you
help
me
because
i
really
didn't
have
this
point
well
in
mind
before,
where
do
i
find
in
the
papers
the
text
of
the
california
statutory
provision
that
allows
the
business
justification
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
johnston,
could
i
interrupt
you
and
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
business
justification
defense?
you
referred
me
to
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
i
gather
is
part
of
the
regulations
rather
than
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
were
those
regulations
in
effect
at
the
time
this
controversy
arose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is
no,
they
were
not
in
effect;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
there
statutory
authorization
for
that
particular
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is...
under
your
california
statute,
i
mean,
there's
no...
is
there
any
judicial...
would
it
be
a
business
defense
for
the
employer
to
come
in
and
say,
we
didn't
have
a
job
open
at
the
time?
say
just
exactly
what...
how
do
we
know
that
you
would
have
won
this
case
against
cal
fed,
in
other
words,
if
these
regulations
had
been
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
but
if
your...
but
it
may
be
there's
no
conflict.
if
a
defense
is
that
there
was
no
job
available,
which
may
be
a
defense
under
your
regulations,
we
may
be
deciding
a
hypothetical
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
previously
says,
if
this
happens...
so
forth
and
so
on...
the
personnel
division
will
make
every
effort
to
provide
similar
and
suitable
position.
don't
we
have
to
presume
they
did
make
every
effort?
and
that
still
wasn't
enough,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
if
they
don't
have
an
obligation
do,
if
they
always
do,
which
they
say
they
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
is
the
first
time
they
had
a
job
available,
i
gather.
well,
i
shouldn't
get
off
into
this.
what
if
california,
ms.
johnston,
were
to
pass
a
statute
that
provided
that
all
people
who
had
immigrated
to
the
united
states
from
some
other
country
within
the
last
three
years
were
to
be
paid
a
minimum
wage
of
$9.
and
the
employer
comes
in
and
objects
and
says,
the
federal
policy
is
to
pay
a
particular
minimum
wage
that's
specified
in
a
federal
statute.
california
has
no
business
singling
out
this
group
for
a
higher
minimum
wage.
and
california's
response
is,
well,
the
employer
can
pay
everybody
$9
an
hour
if
he
wants
to.
is
that
an
adequate
answer
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
olson,
at
the
time
the
california
statute
was
passed,
immediately
after
the
gilbert
decision,
it
was
true,
was
it
not,
that
this
group
did
need
some
extra
help
to
be
equalized
in
the
employment
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
saying
at
the
time
that
california
enacted
its
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
at
the
time
they
enacted
it,
there
was
a
need
to
equalize
the
employment
opportunities
of
the
group
affected
by
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
the
california
statute
was
passed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
