justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
interrupt
to
ask
a
hypothetical
case?
let's
assume
that
an
employer
had
a
man
and
a
women
doing
identical
work,
and
that
each
on
approximately
the
same
day
left
the
employment
because
of
disability,
the
woman
because
of
pregnancy
and
the
man
because
of
an
accident
or
an
operation
or
whatever;
and
they
come
back
to
work
three
months
later
on
the
same
day.
the
woman
is
returned
to
her
job.
the
man
is
told
they're
sorry,
they've
refilled...
or
they've
filled
his
position
with
another
satisfactory
employee,
so
you
go
somewhere
else.
your
brief
says
that's
perfectly
fair.
is
that
your
position
today?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you
say,
it
simply
guarantees
equality
for
all
workers.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you're
saying
it's--
--now
certain
types
of
disabilities
that
men
have
that
need
not
be
mentioned
that
women
do
not
have.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
does
the
state
of
california
resist
amending
its
statute
to
provide
for
complete
equality
based
on
disability?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
congress
under
title
vii,
at
least
the
language
of
title
vii
can
be
read,
i
think...
and
this
is
the
argument
presented
to
us
here
today,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
what
the
answer
is...
that
state
statutes
must
treat
employees
equally.
