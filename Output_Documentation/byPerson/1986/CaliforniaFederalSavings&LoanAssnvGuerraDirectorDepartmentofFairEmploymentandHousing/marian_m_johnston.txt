ms.
marian
m.
johnston
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
amended
title
vii
to
ensure
that
equality
of
employment
opportunity
would
not
be
denied
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
and
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
california's
guarantee
that
pregnant
employees
not
lose
their
jobs
is
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
that
federal
goal.
and
california
submits
that
common
sense,
in
addition
to
the
statutory
language
and
history,
requires
that
the
answer
be
no;
that
all
that
the
two
laws
do
is
to
ensure
that
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
does
not
exist.
and
as
the
court
noted
in
its
questioning
of
mr.
olson,
nothing
in
california's
law
requires
employers
to
violate
title
vii.
what
i
would
like
to
do
this
morning
is,
first,
to
describe
california's
law,
and
then
to
describe
the
pda
in
title
vii,
and
correct
what
i
believe
is
cal
fed's
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
federal
law;
and
finally,
to
show
how
california's
law
does
promote
equality
for
both
men
and
women
and
prevent
discrimination,
once
those
concepts,
equality
and
discrimination,
are
properly
understood.
california
government
code
12945(b)(2)
helps
insure
that
working
women
do
not
lose
their
jobs
because
of
pregnancy
disability.
and
when
women
employees
become
pregnant...
and
approximately
85
percent
of
working
women
will
become
pregnant
at
some
time
during
their
working
lives...
that
inevitably
causes
them
to
be
absent
from
their
jobs
for
some
limited
period
of
time.
now,
what
california
has
done,
and
all
that
california
has
done,
is
to
say
that
women
may
return
to
their
work
once
that
period
of
pregnancy
disability
is
over.
and
for
most
women,
for
95
percent
of
women,
that's
approximately
a
six
week
period.
so
basically
it's
a
right
to
keep
your
job.
it's
not
a
guarantee
as
to
any
paid
benefits,
or
any
type
of
compensation.
it's
not
a
guarantee
of
any
additional
voluntary
time
off
for
child
care
or
parenting
needs--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--that's
correct.
petitioner--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--well,
that's
not
necessarily
true,
your
honor.
because
the
way
this
case
came
up,
before
the
fair
employment
and
house
commission
could
rule
on
the
validity
of
claim
against
cal
fed,
they
brought
this
federal
action
to
enjoin
the
state
statute.
so
if
and
when
the
state
statute
is
finally
declared
valid,
it
would
go
to
a
proceeding
before
the
fair
employment
and
housing
commission.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
on
its
face--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--except
that
the
state
statute
does
permit
employers
not
to
return
pregnant
employees
to
work
if
there
are
sufficient
business
reasons
that
make
it
truly
impossible
not
to
keep
that
job
open.
so
we
don't
know,
at
this
point,
whether
or
not
the
application
of
cal
fed's
statute
actually
discriminates
against
the
real
party
in
interest,
lillian
garland.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
initially
we
did,
your
honor.
but
since
it
was
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute,
and
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
shaw
v.
delta
air
lines,
footnote
14,
which
clearly
gave
you
the
right
to
bring
a
declaratory
relief
action
as
a
facial
challenge
against
a
state
statute
as
approved
by
federal
law;
we
did
not
pursue
that.
so
what
the
state
statute
does
is
really
a
very
minimal
intrusion
on
any
employer's
practices.
all
it
requires
them
to
do
is
to
keep
the
job
available
for
the
woman
once
she
returns
to
work.
on
the
other
hand,
if
an
employer
fails
to
have
such
a
policy,
it
obviously
has
disastrous
effects
on
the
woman
who,
in
effect,
will
lose
her
job
due
to
her
pregnancy.
cal
fed's
claim
is
that
title
vii
preempts
the
california
statute.
and
i
think--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
50.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
now,
since
this
is
a
title
vii
preemption
question,
i
think
the
court
understands
that
title
vii
has
a
very
limited
preemptive
effect
upon
state
laws.
and
congress
has
said
in
effect
that
states
may
make
practices
unlawful,
whether
or
not
such
practices
also
violate
federal
law.
and
the
only
restriction
is
that
you
cannot
require
employers
to
violate
or
purport
to
excuse
violations
of
title
vii.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
title
vii.
and
in
our
circumstances,
warranting
preemption
of
the
state
statute
under
title
vii,
simply
don't
exist
here,
since
title
vii
forbids
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
and
nothing
in
the
california
statute
is
inconsistent
with
that.
now,
what
cal
fed
claims
title
vii
says
is
that
title
vii
is
satisfied.
but
more
than
being
satisfied,
that
it
requires
employers
to
treat
pregnancy
exactly
the
same
as
persons
with
other
medical
conditions.
in
particular,
they
reserve
the
right
to
terminate
any
employee
on
a
disability
leave.
but
that
interpretation
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
is
invalid
for
several
different
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
ignores
the
first
clause
of
the
pda,
which
defines
sex
discrimination
to
include
pregnancy
discrimination.
and
once
that
substantive
definition
is
substituted
in
7038,
which
gives
content
to
what's
an
unlawful
practice
under
title
vii,
it
then
becomes
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
adversely
affect
an
employee's
status
because
of
that
employee's
pregnancy.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
that's
correct,
but--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--i
believe
that's
a
misreading
of
the
statute
to
say
that
pregnancy
discrimination
is
forbidden
the
same
way
as
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
other
disabilities
is
forbidden.
what
it
says
is
that
you
are
to
treat
pregnancy
the
same
as
other
persons
in
their
ability
or
inability
to
work.
what
california's
statute
says
is
that
once
women
are
once
again
able
to
work,
they
should
be
given
their
jobs
back
just
as
anyone
who
has
not
suffered
from
pregnancy.
and
in
fact,
cal
fed's
analysis
would
lead
to
the
absurd
result
that
the
guarantee
against
pregnancy
discrimination
would
have
no
substantive
content;
you
could
treat
pregnant
employees
as
harshly
as
you
treat
employees
with
other
medical
conditions.
for
example,
there
is
nothing
unlawful
under
title
vii
if
an
employer
chose
to
fire
all
employees
with,
say,
diabetes,
whether
or
not
that
person
was
able
to
work.
clearly,
they
couldn't
do
that
under
the
pda.
the
flaw
in
cal
fed's
analysis,
i
think,
is
to
equate
pregnancy
discrimination
with
discrimination
against
other
disabilities.
and
what
title
vii
did
is
to
equate
pregnancy
discrimination
with
sex
discrimination.
and
it's
a
very
crucial
difference.
and
the
other
flaw
in
cal
fed's
interpretation
of
the
pda
is
that
if
the
same
treatment
always
satisfies
title
vii,
and
nothing
more
is
ever
required,
that
you
can
treat
pregnancy
as
badly
as
you
treat
every
other
medical
condition,
then
that
undercuts
this
court's
line
of
reasoning
beginning
with
criggs
v.
duke
power,
which
is
applied
to
pregnancy
in
the
satty
case,
saying
that
you
cannot
have
an
employment
practice
which
adversely
affects
a
group
of
pregnant
women
because
of
their
pregnancy,
because
that
is
inevitably
sex
discrimination.
now,
the
two
terms,
equality
and
discrimination--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--well,
since
this
is
a
preemption
case,
your
honor,
we
don't
need
to
decide
what
title
vii
requires
the
way
that
cal
fed
violates
it.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
well,
various
possibilities
exist.
it
would
depend
on
what
this
court
chooses
to
do
with
the
second
clause
of
the
pda
and--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--california
doesn't
care
which
way
the
court
comes
out
on
that.
i
think--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--we
do
argue
that
the
disparate
impact
analysis
has
to
be
available
and
that
a
plaintiff
in
a
title
vii
case
would
have
to
be
able
to
establish
that
an
inadequate
leave
policy
had
a
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
sex,
including
pregnancy.
and
not
just
california
has
that
position,
but
the
eecc
takes
that
position
in
their
guidelines
29
cfe
1604.2
et
seq.
so
if
a
plaintiff,
apart
from
the
california
statute,
but
if
a
plaintiff
were
simply
trying
to
prove
a
title
vii
violation,
then
i
think
they
have
the
option
available
of
proving
a
disparate
impact
and
proving
that
title
vii
has
been
violated,
despite
equal
treatment.
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
this
particular
case.
since
it
is
a
preemption
case,
all
we
have
to
do
is
prove
that
title
vii
does
not
forbid
what
the
state
is
trying
to
achieve,
which
is
simply
to
insure
that
pregnant
employees
keep
their
jobs
the
same
as
nonpregnant
employees
are
able
to
keep
their
jobs.
and
i
think
that's
very
crucial,
to
realize
that
the
distinction
is
protection
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
and
there
were
some
questions
during
mr.
olson's
argument
about
what
the
effect
is
on
persons
with
other
disabilities.
california
submits
that
is
not
a
distinction
which
it's
only
california
that's
chosen
to
make.
but
congress
itself
has
chosen
to
make
that
same
distinction
in
title
vii
in
forbidding
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy,
and
not
forbidding
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
other
disabilities.
and
i
think
that
true
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
is
difficult
to
understand
without
focusing
on
what
it
means
as
far
as
providing
pregnancy
disability
leave.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
no,
i
don't
think
it's
perfectly
fair.
i
think
that
it's
not
unlawful.
and
i
think
that
there's
a
distinction,
your
honor.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
women
as
compared
to
men,
in
that
neither
lose
their
job
due
to
pregnancy
and
child
birth.
on
the
other
hand,
both
men
and
women
can
face
losing
their
jobs
due
to
other
disabilities.
and
that
may,
in
fact,
be
unfair,
but
it's
not
unlawful
under
either
federal
law
or
state
law.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
that's
true.
and
i
think
that
one
interpretation
of
the
second
clause
of
the
pda,
and
a
very
logical
interpretation
in
view
of
this
court's
dissent
in
gilbert,
which
the
pda
was
intended
to
affect,
is
that
where
there
are
other
disabilities
other
traits,
which
are
inevitably
linked
to
a
prohibited
basis
of
discrimination,
such
as
sickle
cell
anemia
and
race,
that
it
would
be
as
unlawful
to
discrimination
on
those
characteristics
as
it
is
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
it
simply
hasn't
gone
that
far,
your
honor,
and
neither
has
congress.
so--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--and
if
that
is
the
interpretation
that
the
court
chooses
to
adopt
of
title
vii,
california
has
no
problem
with
that.
our
concern
is
in
maintaining
our
state
statute.
and
whatever
title
vii
also
requires,
obviously,
employers
also
have
to
comply
with.
so,
since
it's
a
preemption
case,
we
really
don't
advocate
one
interpretation
of
title
vii
or
another,
except
to
say
that
our
statute
is
not
preemptive,
because
we
don't
make
any
practices
unlawful.
but
when
you
consider
providing
pregnancy
disability,
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
title
vii
forbids
sex
discrimination,
including
pregnancy
discrimination.
and
providing
pregnancy
disability
leave
doesn't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex.
and
maybe
it
doesn't
even
make
sense
to
talk
about
disability...
pregnancy
disability
even
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
it
discriminates
against
men.
i
think
that
may
be
why
in
the
newport
news
case,
this
court
found
that
it
was
ordinary
sex
discrimination,
not
pregnancy
discrimination,
to
provide
the
same
benefits
to
male
employees
and
their
spouses
as
was
provided
to
female
employees
and
their
spouses.
but
here,
it's
really
irrelevant
to
male
employees
whether
or
not
an
employer
provides
pregnancy
disability
leave.
the
male
employee
is
going
to
keep
his
job
when
he
has
a
child.
there's
no
interruption
of
his
work
life.
there's
no
problem
with
him
keeping
his
job
despite
the
fact
that
he's
decided
to
have
a
child.
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
be
disastrous
to
women
if
they
risk
losing
their
jobs
if
they
decide
to
have
families.
so
when
it's
viewed
in
that
light,
it's
neither
preferential
nor
prejudicial
to
either
men
or
women;
it's
simply
an
equalizer
making
sure
that
women,
like
men,
don't
have
to
choose
between
employment
and
childbirth,
that
they
can
combine
both,
and
that
women
can
complete
equally
with
men
on
that
basis.
and
the
concept
of
equality
that
california
would
like
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
although
the
basic
principle
is
that
similarly
situated
persons
are
to
be
treated
alike,
something
very
different
has
to
occur
when
persons
are
not
similar
situated.
because
in
those
circumstances,
similar
treatment
may
in
fact
lead
to
inequality.
and
maybe
in
most
circumstances,
men
and
women
are
equally
situated
regarding
pregnancy.
that
was
certainly
true
in
newport
news,
where
both
male
and
female
employees
had
pregnancy-related
expenses.
but
it's
not
true
regarding
the
need
for
pregnancy
disability
leave,
which
once
again,
is
simply
something
that
is
irrelevant
to
men.
they
keep
their
jobs
anyway.
but
it's
very
essential
for
women.
so
that
providing
pregnancy
disability
leave
is
consistent
both
with
the
goal
of
providing
equality
of
employment
opportunity
without
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex,
and
insuring
that
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
does
not
occur.
the
pda
was
intended
to
give
effect
to
the
court's
dissent
in
gilbert.
and
one
very
critical
statement
in
that
dissent,
which
the
ninth
circuit
relied
upon
in
upholding
the
california
statute,
was
the
statement
that
a
realistic
understanding
of
today's
labor
environment
warrants
taking
pregnancy
into
account.
and
that's
precisely
what
california
has
done
as
well
as
either
other
states.
and
in
passing
the
pda,
congress
specifically
noted
two
of
those
states,
montana
and
connecticut,
that
at
that
time
already
had
a
statute
very
similar
to
the
one
that's
under
consideration
here.
so
congress
was
obviously
aware
of
those
statutes,
and
said,
federal
law
may
not
go
that
far.
but
we're
not
preventing
states,
if
they
wish
to,
to
do
something
in
addition.
and
the
state
obviously
has
a
very
strong
interest
in
protecting
the
rights
of
both
men
and
women
employees
to
keep
working
and
not
to
lose
their
jobs
on
a
basis
that
the
other
group
is
not
subject
to.
but
it's
not
just
an
adverse
effect
upon
pregnant
employees.
it
would
be
an
adverse
upon
their
families,
upon
the
state's
disability
and
employment
insurance
compensation
programs,
and
on
the
right
to
procreation
itself,
if
for
any
reason,
women
faced
a
choice
between
keeping
their
jobs
or
having
a
child.
and
what
the
california
statute
says
is
that
women,
just
like
men,
don't
have
to
face
any
conflict
between
the
two;
that
they
have
the
same
opportunity
as
men
to
combine
childbirth
and
employment;
and
can
become
parents
without
risking
job
loss.
so
it
removes
an
unequal
burden
that
men
never
face.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
they
were
in
the
process,
your
honor.
and
because
of--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--they
were
not.
but
parties
have
stipulated
that
that--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--not
any
more
than
there's
statutory
authorization
for
the
business
necessity
defense
under
title
vii.
it
is
a
judicially
recognized
defense.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
we
don't
know.
what
we're
saying
is
that...
what
cal
fed
is
saying
is
they
shouldn't
have
to
go
through
the
administrative
hearing
process
and
prove
whether
or
not
they
had
a
legitimate
defense,
because
they
don't
have
to
reach
that
point.
so--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--well,
it's
not
simply
that
there's
no
job
available,
but
that
the
employer
did
not
make
reasonable
efforts,
sufficient
efforts,
to
maintain
the
job.
i
think
that
it
is
a
live
controversy,
in
that
cal
fed
is
claiming
that
no
employer
has
to
make
any
effort
to
keep
a
job
open;
that
if
an
employer
has
a
blanket
policy
of
reserving
the
right
to
terminate
all
disabled
employees,
that
it
may
simply
treat
pregnant
employees
the
same.
and
clearly
that
would
not
be
lawful
under
the
california
statute.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
cal
fed
says,
and
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
40,
i
believe
your
honor,
that
it
says
that
it
reserves
the
right
to
terminate...
cal
fed
reserves
the
right
to
terminate
an
employee
on
leave
of
absence
if
a
similar
or
suitable
position
is
not
available.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
i
don't
think
that's
enough,
your
honor.
because
they're
saying
they
don't
have
any
obligation
to.
and
the
state
statute
clearly
says
you
do
have
an
obligation
to,
unless
you
can
prove--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--well,
they
didn't
in
this
case,
your
honor.
lillian
garland
was,
in
fact,
out
of
work
for
about
three
months
while
she
had
a
casarean
birth.
and
when
she
was
ready
to
come
back
to
work,
cal
fed
said
to
her,
we
do
not
have
another
receptionist
position
open.
and
in
fact,
she
did
not
go
back
to
work
for
another
seven
months.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
still
correct
that
california
does
have
a
higher
minimum
wage
than
the
federal
minimum,
and
all
employees
have
to
receive
that.
the
problem
with
a
statute
that
singled
out
persons
from
other
countries,
for
example,
for
a
higher
minimum
wage,
is
that
it
would
probably
be
unconstitutional.
there
has
not
been
any
constitutional
challenge
to
this
statute.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
well,
at
the
very
least
they
would
have
to
show
a
sufficient
state
interest
in
order
to
justify
such
a
state
statute.
assuming
that
more
rigorous
standard
of
review
were
applied
to
pregnancy
discrimination,
i
don't
think
there's
be
any
problem
with
the
state
having
to...
being
able
to
justify
its
needs
to
insure
that
pregnant
employees
don't
lose
their
jobs.
the
other
problem
with
your
hypothetical,
i
believe,
is
that
it
probably
would
violate
title
vii,
which
forbids
national
origin
discrimination,
because
you
would
be
treating
people--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--and
i
think
that
that's
a
perfectly
reasonable
interpretation
of
title
vii.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
california
has
no
problem
if
the
court
chooses
to
interpret
title
vii
to
say
that
other
employees
shall
get
that
same
benefit.
that's
a
question
of
federal
law.
and
we're
simply
concerned
with
preserving
our
state
law.
the
other
difference,
i
think,
is
that
your
hypothetical
raises
a
problem
of
the
legislature
making
an
assumption
about
an
entire
group
of
people,
saying,
because
you
come
from
another
country,
you're
in
need
of
higher
wages.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
but
the
california
statute
is
quite
different
in
that
it
doesn't
assume
that
pregnant
employees
are
going
to
need
any
specific
time
off.
what
it
does
is
cover
exactly
the
period
of
pregnancy
disability;
no
more
and
no
less.
so
that
by
moving
pregnancy
disability
from
a
factor
in
your
ability
to
keep
your
job,
what
california
is
doing
is
preventing
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
it's
not
a
stereotype--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--well,
what
it
is
is
a
limit,
though,
on
the
amount
of
leave
that
a
woman
can
receive.
what
she
actual
receives
is
her
actual
period
of
disability.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
that's
correct.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
and
if
that
happens,
your
honor,
then
this
particular
california
statute
does
not
apply.
what
would
happen
then
would
be
what
justice
o'connor
was
suggesting,
in
that
you
would
have
to
prove
a
typical
title
vii
or
employment
discrimination
case
in
showing
that
failing
to
give
more
than
four
months
had
an
adverse
impact.
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
is
really
irrelevant
to
this
case.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
that
is
true.
they
have
made
a
presumption
that
four
months
will
take
care
of
the
majority
of
the
cases.
and
there
may
be
some
pregnant
employees
that...
for
which
that
is
not
sufficient.
but
what
we
would
like
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
california's
guarantee
is
purely
for
job
retention.
and
in
being
sure
that
pregnant
employees
keep
their
jobs,
it
not
only
is
not
inconsistent,
but
we
believe
it's
perfectly
compatible
and
consistent
with
title
vii's
goal
of
equality
for
both
and
women,
despite
the
fact
that
only
women
become
pregnant.
it
doesn't
require
employers
to
violate
title
vii
in
any
way.
it
simply
corrects
for
a
biological
burden
that
only
women,
and
not
men,
in
the
workforce
face.
and,
finally,
that
it
is
a
legitimate
exercise
of
california's
authority
to
ensure
that
equal
employment
opportunity
will
not
be
denied.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
thank
you.
