mr.
olson,
that
may
well
be
unlawful,
but
not
unlawful
under
title
vii.
i
mean,
that
might
be
unlawful
under
the
constitution.
here,
we
do
not
have...
at
least
you're
not
arguing
that
we
have...
a
form
of
discrimination
by
the
state
that
is
constitutionally
unlawful.
you're
not
saying
that
it's
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
treat
pregnant
women
specially
in
its
statutes.
title
vii
does
not
apply
to
states;
it
applies
to
employer.
and
i
don't
see
how--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
not
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
employers.
to
make
the
argument
you're
making,
you
have
to
make
the
leap
to
say
that
title
vii
prevents
action
by
the
state
as
a
state,
as
a
governing
institution,
that
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
you
were
going
to
say,
special
benefits.
it
doesn't
authorize
or
require
them
to
do
that.
it
just
says,
provide
these
benefits.
now,
maybe
they
have
to
provide
to
everybody
else,
and
that
may
be
very
expensive,
which
means
it
may
be
a
very
silly
law.
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
the
law
violates
title
vii.
justice
antonin
scalia
an
employer?
or
cal
fed
itself.
they
can't
just
come
in
and
say,
if
an
employer
wants
to
do
it.
is
cal
fed
saying
that
they
were
such
an
employer?
