chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
no.
85-494,
california
federal
savings
and
loan
association
versus
mark
guerra.
mr.
olson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson,
supposing
that
this
court
were
to
affirm
to
the
california
judgment
and
say
that
your
employer,
your
client,
had
to
treat
all
of
its
leave
policies
the
same
way
that
it
treats
the
pregnancies
which
are
required
to
be
treated
under
california
law.
how
would
that
require
you
to
change
your
existing
policy
in
the
concrete
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
specifically,
would
it
work?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
situations
new
where
a
person
takes
leave
because
of
illness
or
disability
is
it
common
not
to
allow
the
person
to
go
back
to
the
job?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
wouldn't
be
a
judicial
extension.
this
would
be
an
action
by
employers
to
bring
their
policies
into
conformity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
we'll
hear
from
you
now,
ms.
johnston.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
raise
any
question
in
the
action
of
the
district
court
as
to
whether
the
district
court
should
have
gone
ahead
with
the
proceedings
if
there
was
something
pending
before
the
california
commission?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
it
be
unconstitutional?
supposing
the
california
legislature
said,
these
people
are
particularly
needy.
they
have
a
hard
time
bargaining
well
with
employers.
and
we
think
we
can
legislate
as
to
this
particular
class.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
california
comes
in
in
a
case
like
this,
where
that
question
is
raised,
and
says:
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
violate
it
at
all.
it
can
just
pay
everybody
$9
an
hour.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
most
laws
are
based
on,
isn't
it,
assumptions
that
the
legislature
makes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
california
legislature
has
specified
a
period
of
four
months,
which
is
certainly
a
generalization
that
may
not
apply
in
every
single
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
isn't
it
conceivable
that
some
women
might
need
more
than
four
months
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i
wanted
to
point
out
by
my
question
is
that
there
is
an
area
of
general
legislation
in
the
california
statute
where
they
specify
four
months
as
the
period
that
the
limit
can't
exceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
johnston.
mr.
olson,
do
you
have
any
more?
you
have
about
two
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
