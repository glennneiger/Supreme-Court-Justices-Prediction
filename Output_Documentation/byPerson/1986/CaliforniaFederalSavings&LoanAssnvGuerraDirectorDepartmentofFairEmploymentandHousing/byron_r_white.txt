how
would
you
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
how
about
the
four
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
just
any
disability
up
to
four
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
i
suppose
that
if
you
can
imagine
an
employer
without
any
disability
leave
policy,
in
order
to
comply
with
both
california
and
the
federal
law
they
would
have
to
adopt
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
mr.
olson,
could
california
pass
a
general
law
that
says,
if
an
employer
is
going
to
have
a
disability
policy,
or
indeed,
it
passes
a
law
and
says,
all
employers
shall
have
a
disability
plan
which
shall
be
as
follows.
and
it
covers
everybody
including
pregnancy.
could
california
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
you
win
this
case,
california
could
just
say,
well,
we're
going
to
extend
these
disability
provisions
that
we
have
said
apply
to
pregnancy
to
everyone?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
could
be
that...
it
could
be
congress
doesn't
pass
it
because
they
don't
think
it's
necessary.
they've
already
got
title
vii.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
comply
with
both
statutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
employers
would
not
have
to
adopt
a
pregnancy
leave
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
employers
would
be
perfectly
free
not
to
have
any
disability?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
something
that
the
petitioner
doesn't
provide
for
in
its
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
to
comply,
the
petitioner
will
certainly
have
to
change
its
leave
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
on
its
face,
petitioners'--
justice
byron
r.
white
--disability
leave
policy
does
not
provide
for
it.
