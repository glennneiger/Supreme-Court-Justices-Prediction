justice
byron
r.
white
that
assumes...
that
assumes
that
the
self-defense...
the
defense
of
self-defense
implicates
some
element
of
the
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
the
state
has
to
prove
by
a...
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
murder
was
purposeful,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
burden
always
stays
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
like...
it's
like
a
lot
of...
the
defendant
may
want
to
come
in
and
say,
i
didn't
shot
them...
shoot
this
person
at
all,
or
i
didn't
have
any
purpose
to
do...
but
if
the
state
convinces
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
did
have
that
purpose,
what's
left
of
this
self-defense
argument?
all
you're
saying...
all
the
self-defense
instruction
says
is
that
you...
if
you
succeed
in
putting
in
enough
evidence
that
you
acted
in
self-defense,
you're
excused.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
instruction
reduces
the
state's
burden
in
proving
purposefulness?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
instructions
did
say
that
the
state
had
to
prove
purposefulness
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
say...
then
the
instruction
on
self-defense
lowered
that
burden?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
was
purposeful,
you've
gone
a
long
ways
to
prove
that
it
wasn't
done
in
self-defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
state...
the
state
has
to
prove
the
mens
re
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
wasn't,
they
shouldn't
be
convicted.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what
if
the
state
succeeds
in
proving
it.
and
no
matter
how
difficult
it
is,
the
jury
finds
that
there
was
intentional,
purposeful
killing?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you're
wrong
on
this?
what
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
this
being
an
inalienable
right?
do
you
still
win
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
saying
was
self-defense?
yes,
i
committed--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
committed
murder,
but
i
didn't
commit
a
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
states
do
not
require
the
state
to
prove
the
absence
of
self-defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
this
jury's
instructed
to
acquit
unless
the
state
proves
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
this
intentional,
purposeful
killing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
the
jury's
told
that
this
self-defense
defense
must
be
proved
beyond...
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
why
shouldn't
the
instruction
be,
to
the
jury,
that
the
defendant
proves
a
claim
of
self-defense?
and
if
its
evidence
about
self-defense
raises
a
reasonable
doubt
about
whether
the
defendant
killed
purposefully,
you
should
acquit?
doesn't
it
really
water
down
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
to
say
that
before
there's
a
reasonable
doubt
raised
by
the
defendant's
evidence
with
respect
to
self-defense,
which
goes
to
purposefulness,
he's
got
to
prove
it
beyond
a...
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i'm
just
asking
you
about
what
the
effect
of
the
instruction
is.
because
you
say,
if
there's
a
reasonable
doubt
about
purposefulness,
acquit.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
if
the
doubt
about...
if
the
defendant
is
claiming
it's
not
purposeful
because
of
self-defense,
don't
acquit
unless
it's
proved
beyond...
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not
be
very
heavy.
but
the
jury
is
not
told
to
acquit
if
there's...
if
the
defendant's
evidence
raises
only
a
reasonable
doubt
about
purposefulness.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
isn't
that
contrary
to
mullaney...
i
mean,
to
winship?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me...
let's
assume
the
defendant's...
the
defendant
simply
puts
in
other
evidence
about
purposefulness.
he
doesn't
claim
self-defense,
but
he
puts
in
some
other
evidence
about
purposefulness.
now,
if
he
raises
a
reasonable
doubt
about
whether
he
purposefully
killed,
he's
acquitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
with
the
self-defense
defense,
that
won't
do
him
that
much...
he
has
to
do
more
than
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
rather
strange?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
if
it
isn't
strange,
it
couldn't
be
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
self-defense
reads
on
those
elements,
or
at
least
some
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say...
do
you
think
it
ever
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
self-defense
goes
to
purposefulness
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
he
says,
i
had
no
prior
purpose
at
all
to
kill
this
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
want
to
kill
them
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
my
question
is,
does
it
go
to
purposefulness
or
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
his
burden
in
establishing
his
so-called
defense
be
no
more
than
evidence
enough
to
raise
a
reasonable
doubt
about
purposefulness?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
there's
a
challenge,
a
constitutional
challenge,
to
that
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
--it's
the
only
way
to
stop.
xxx
on
his
side
of
the
case,
he's
going
to
have
to
prove
beyond...
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
the
state
has
to
get
by...
get
by
a
motion
to
acquit
on
its
side
of
the
case.
but
then
you're
going
to
put
in
on
your
side...
you
certainly
aren't
going
to
put
in...
the
defendant
isn't
going
to
put
in
all
of
his
self-defense
evidence
on
cross-examination,
is
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
ohio
says
that
once
the
state
has
made
out
its
case
and
survived
the
motion
for
acquittal,
it
has
proved
purpose--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
has
proved
purposefulness
enough
that
unless
the
defendant,
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
proves,
didn't
have
a
purpose--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
to
the
extent
that
self-defense
goes
to
purposefulness
or
prior
design,
you
have
to...
the
defendant
has
a
substantial
burden
of
proof,
not
just
raising
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
jury
is
told
how
to
measure
the
evidence,
what
consequence
to
attach
to
the
defendant's
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
martin
case,
martin
against
ohio,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justices
brennan
and
marshall
have
joined
that
opinion
and
justice
blackman
has
joined
parts
1
and
3
of
justice
powell's
opinion.
