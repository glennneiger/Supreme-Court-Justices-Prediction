justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
willis,
can
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
basic
point
as
to
whether
there
is
an
inherent,
inalienable
right
of
self-defense,
when
you
recite
to
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
like.
when
is
the
first
time,
to
your
recollection,
that
someone
asserted
that
there
was
such
an
inalienable
right
of
self-defense
that
was
constitutional...
a
matter
of
constitutional,
substantive
due
process?
that's,
frankly,
the
first
time
i
bumped
into
it
was
in
your
brief.
but
the
founders
didn't...
that's
not
one
of
the
things
they
talked
about,
that
i
can
recall.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
what
is
the
first
time
that
you
can
tell
us
about
that
somebody
identified
self-defense
as
one
of
those
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sadd,
can
i
go
back--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
justice
white's
question
a
moment
ago?
he
asked
you
if
the
evidence
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
showed
a
reasonable
doubt
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
defendant
had
a
purpose
to
kill,
just
the
evidence
was
strong
enough
to
raise
a
reasonable
doubt,
is
it
not
correct
that
under
ohio
law
the
jury
would
then
be
under
a
duty
to
acquit,
because
there's
a
reasonable
doubt
on
one
of
the
elements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
but
if
she
convinced
the
jury
that
there
was
reasonable
doubt
with
regard
to
her
purpose,
she's
entitled
to
an
acquittal?
