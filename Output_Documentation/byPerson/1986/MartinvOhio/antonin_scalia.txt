mr.
willis,
doesn't
that
all
hinge
on...
on
the
implicit
assumption
that
a
state
could
not
make
it
a
crime
to
kill
somebody
in
self-defense?
isn't
that
the
premise
of
your
argument,
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
couldn't
a
state...
bear
in
mind
that
in
order
to
be
convicted,
the
defendant
here
had
to
be
shown
to
have
intentionally,
wilfully
killed.
he
intended
to
kill,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right;
so
he
intended
to
kill.
why
couldn't
a
state
court...
a
state
say,
you
shall
not
kill
in
self-defense?
you
can
main,
you
can,
you
know...
but
you
cannot
intentionally
kill
somebody
in
self-defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
persuaded
that
you
have
the
right
to
act
in
self-defense.
but
do
you
have
the
right,
necessarily,
to
kill
in
self-defense,
intentionally
to
kill
in
self-defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
must
that
be
a
right
that
the
state
gives?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
order
to
prove
the
defense
of
self-defense,
what
has
to
be
shown
in
ohio?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
more
than
was
reasonably
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
talk
about
the
48
states
that
have
it.
you
say
they
apparently
get
along
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
how
you
can...
if
you're
being
genuine
about
proving
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
how
can
you
ever
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
in
a
private
struggle
between
two
individuals,
with
no
witnesses,
as
occurred
here,
how
can
you
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
which
one
was
the
aggressor
and
which
one
wasn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
really
think
you
can
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
which
one
was
the
aggressor?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
willis,
can
i
come
back
briefly
to
what
a
state
can
do
by
way
of
eliminating
the
defense
entirely?
i
find
it
hard
to
conceive
of
a
situation
where
you
couldn't
defend
yourself
without
intentionally
killing
the
other
person.
i
mean,
it'd
be
enough
to
incapacitate
the
other
person,
to
render
the
other
person
unconscious.
so
why
couldn't
the
state
say,
you
may
not
intend
to
kill
somebody
in
self-defense?
now,
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here,
intentionally
killing
in
self-defense.
why
can't
a
state
say,
you
can
do
anything
in
self-defense,
you
can
maim,
you
can
incapacitate,
but
you
will
not
intentionally
kill
somebody
in
self-defense.
and
if
you
do
that,
you're
going
to
be
punished.
is
that
against
natural
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
including
intentional
killing,
even
though...
even
though
there
may
be
something
short
of
that
that
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
probably
a
lot
of
it
in
rudyard
kipling.
you
could
always
use
rudyard
kipling.
justice
antonin
scalia
had
ohio
law
been
different
before
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
had
ohio
law
regarding
the
issue
of
self-defense
and
who
had
the
burden,
had
it
been
different
before
the
statute
that
you're
using?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
the
48
states
that
we've
heard
about,
they've
all
done
it
by
statutory
amendment
to
their
common
law
rules?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait,
you
say
it's
one
thing
if
the
element
that
you're
putting
the
burden
on
the
defendant
for
knocks
it
down
from
murder
to
manslaughter,
but
it's
different
if
that
element
knocks
it
down
from
murder
to
nothing
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
supposes
ohio
passes
a
law
saying
that
anyone
who
kills
anybody
is
guilty
of
murder,
period.
it
is
an
affirmative
defense
that
you
didn't
intend
to
kill
anybody;
in
other
words,
the
whole
malice
element
for
murder--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
relationship
at
all.
if
you
kill
somebody,
you're
guilty
of
murder.
affirmative
defense,
you
didn't
intend
to
kill
anybody.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
part
of
that
showing
could
be
the
fact
that
he
had
been
the
aggressor
and
she
was
acting
in
self-defense
trying
to
protect
her
life?
in
other
words,
you
can
get
some
elements
of
self-defense
into
the
defense
of
no
intent
to
kill,
couldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that.
but
my
only
point
is
that
ohio
is
not
writing
out...
is
not
really
casting
on
the
defendant
all
burden
on
the
issue
of
self-defense.
to
the
extent
that
acting
in
self-defense
causes
you
not
to
intend
to
kill
somebody,
so
that
you're
just
trying
to
fend
them
off,
and
you
don't
affirmatively
intend
to
kill
them,
you
can
introduce
all
of
that
evidence--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
rebuttal
of
the
state's
burden
which
it
has
to
demonstrate
clearly
an
convincingly
that
you
intended
to
kill.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
only
after
the
state
shows
that
you
intended
to
kill,
then
you
have
the
affirmative
defense
to
say,
i
did
intend
to
kill,
but
i
intended
to
kill--
