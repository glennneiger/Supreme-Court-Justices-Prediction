excuse
me,
may
i
just
add
one
point
to
say,
the
facts
are
peculiarly
in
the
knowledge
of
the
defendant...
aren't
all
the
facts
peculiarly
in
his...
why
not
make
him
prove
the
whole
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
the
burden
is
place
on
the
defendant--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--to
show
self-defense
because
he
has
the
best
knowledge
of
the
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
also
has
the
best
knowledge
of
whether
it's
murder
or
not,
ehy
not
require
to
prove
that
too?
