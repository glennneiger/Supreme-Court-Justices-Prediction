mr.
george
j.
sadd
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
courts:
on
november
1st,
1978,
the
ohio
legislature
enacted
a
law
with
respect
to
common
law
affirmative
defenses.
that
law,
section
2901.05,
reads
as
follows:
every
person
accused
of
an
offense
is
presumed
innocent
until
proven
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
the
burden
of
proof
for
all
elements
of
the
offense
is
upon
the
prosecution.
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence
of
an
affirmative
defense
and
the
burden
of
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
for
an
affirmative
defense,
is
upon
the
accused.
the
petitioner,
at
her
trial,
objected
to
this
jury
instruction.
consequently,
the
issue
placed
before
this
court,
is
whether
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
required
the
state
of
ohio
to
disprove
the
affirmative
defense
of
self-defense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
no,
since
its
inception
into
statehood,
ohio
has
followed
the
common
law
view
approach
that
the
proponderance
of...
the
defendant
must
prove
the
affirmative
defense
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
with
an
exception
of
a
two-year
period
from
1976
to
1978.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
think
most
of
those
states
perhaps
changed
their
viewpoint
when
this
court
came
down
with
its
decision
in
mullaney
back
in
the
nineteen-seventies.
and
i
think
patterson
makes
it
quite
clear,
justice
scalia,
that
merely
because
another
state
chooses
to
disprove
affirmative
defenses,
that
doesn't
mean
that
strikes...
states
that
strike
a
different
balance
are
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
and
that's
our
position
here,
that
this
is
a
matter
of--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--i
really
don't
know,
justice
white.
i
think
there's
been
some
indication...
not
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
but
a
brief
of
an
amicus,
claiming
something
like
46
states.
that
i
cannot
verify.
because
other
states
are
not
really
important
for
the
consideration
of
how
ohio
treats
this.
and
this
is
implicitly
recognized
in
patterson,
where
the
comment
by
the
patterson
court
simply
states
that
merely
because
other
states
take
on
the
burden
of
disproving
affirmative
defenses,
doesn't
mean
that
states
that
strike
a
different
balance
are
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
and
i
think
that's
clearly
the
case
when
we
see
with
the
insanity
reform
act
of
1984,
and
davis
v.
united
states.
you
can
recall
in
davis
v.
united
states
that
the
burden
of
disproving
insanity
was
upon
the
federal
government.
and
then
later
on
in
1984,
when
the
insanity
defense
reform
act
came
down,
congress,
in
the
intent,
placed
a
burden
of
disproving
insanity
on
the
defendant
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
and
so
i
think
other
states,
really,
are
not
the
issue
in
this
particular
case.
the
issue,
as
i
frame
it,
is
whether
or
not
ohio's
statute
2901.05
violates
the
constitution.
and
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
according
not
to
the
petitioner,
justice
o'connor,
but
according
to
the
brief
of
the
amicus
filed
in
this
case,
that
south
carolina
is
the
only
other
state.
whether
or
not
this
is
true,
i
have
no
way
of
garnering
that
information.
i
think
that
other
states
place
different
burdens,
burdens
of
going
forward.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
think
ohio's
burden
by
placing
it
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
affords
a
defendant
even
greater
protection
than
other
states;
and
that
it
gives
you
a
measurable
standard
upon
which
your
conduct
is
to
be
evaluated,
and
nothing
more
than
that.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
think
that
language
was
correct
at
that
time,
and
i
think
the
qualifying
words,
justice
o'connor,
was,
at
that
time.
ohio
law
has
come
a
long
way
since
engle
v.
isaac.
i
also
think
it--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--correct,
and
i'll
get
into
that
in
the
argument
as
i
show
what
the
elements
of
ohio
law
is
with
respect
to
the
analysis,
which
i
think
the
major
analysis
under
patterson
and
this
court's
decision
in
patterson.
but
i'd
also
like
to
note
that
engle
v.
isaac,
through
your
opinion,
and
through,
i
believe,
justice
stevens'
concurring
opinion,
consistently
held
that
even
the
statute
at
that
time
did
not
mandate
that
the
state
of
ohio
disprove
the
affirmative
defense
of
self-defense.
and
that's
the
holding
of
engle
v.
isaac.
as
i
was
saying,
this
court's
decision
in
leland
and
patterson
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
due
process
clause
is
not
violated
when
the
legislature
places
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
to
establish
the
affirmative
defense
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
especially
when
the
affirmative
defenses
constitute
separate
matter;
and
that
there's
no
direct
relationship
exists
between
the
elements
of
the
crime
and
the
affirmative
defense.
chronologically,
i'd
like
to
start
my
analysis
with
the
decision
of
leland
v.
oregon.
the
proposition
that
the
petitioner
has
raised
before
this
court
is
certainly
not
novel.
that
same
proposition
was
raised
34
years
ago
in
the
leland
case.
there,
the
individual
petitioner
contended
that
to
place
the
burden
of
proving
the
defense
of...
the
affirmative
defense
of
insanity
upon
that
individual
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
rejecting
that
claim,
this
court
noted
in
leland,
and
established
the
broad
constitutional
principle,
that
due
process
is
not
violated
where
oregon
placed
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
to
establish
a...
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
affirmative
defense
of
insanity.
and
contrary
to
the
petitioner's
argument
that
insanity
and
self-defense
are
different,
they
really
do
not
differ
in
that
both
are
separate
matters
and
both
constitute
conduct
which
arguably
could
be
lawful.
and
i
think
in
leland
we
look
to
the
constitutional
principles
that
this
court
sought
to
pass
on
to
us
to
this
very
day.
and
one
of
the
first
arguments
they
made
was
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
state,
consistently,
to
establish
the
elements
of
the
crime.
number
two,
that
the
defendant
was
presumed
innocent
and
the
jury
given
that
instruction.
and
number
three,
that
insanity
was
a
separate
issue
which
the
state
could
place
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant.
and
the
vitality
and
the
long
life
of
this
decision
from
34
years
ago
survives
to
this
very
day.
this
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
review
leland
in
rivera
v.
delaware;
it
had
an
opportunity
to
affirm
the
leland
principle
in
jones
v.
united
states;
and
more
recently,
the
circuit
court
of
appeal,
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
united
states
v.
amos,
upheld
the
1984
insanity
defense
act,
by
placing...
which
placed
the
burden
on
the
defendant,
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
to
establish
the
affirmative
defense
of
insanity.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
think
it
was
the
federal
sixth
circuit...
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it's
a
very
recent
case.
i
think
that
came
down
about
three
weeks
ago.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
well,
i
know
what
he's
contending,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
believe
that
it's
really
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
because
insanity
is
a
separate
affirmative
defense...
i
mean
a
separate
affirmative
defense.
and
self-defense
is
a
separate
matter.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
your
honor,
they're
both
affirmative
defenses.
and
i
think
the
broad
proposition
to
be
established
is
that
simply
the
due
process
clause
does
not
require
the
prosecution
to
prove
a
negative;
that
is,
to
disprove
an
affirmative
defense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
that's
the
state's
position.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
there's
no
question
that
mullaney
was
a
proper
decision,
mr.
chief
justice.
mullaney
involved
the
crime
in
maine
being
both...
two
crimes,
murder
and
manslaughter.
and
the
difference
between
the
two
was
malice.
but
the
jury
was
charged
that
there
was
a
presumption
that
malice
had
to
be
placed
on
the
defendant
to
get
the
benefit.
and
that
was
what
this
court
found
to
be
so
reprehensible
that
the
prosecution
was
relieved
of
its
duty
to
establish
an
essential
element
of
the
crime.
and
that
was
the
damnation,
so
to
speak,
of
the
main
statute.
ohio
doesn't
have
this.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
no,
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
i'm
saying
that
in
mullaney
the
defendant
was
to
establish
an
element
of
the
state's
case.
ohio
doesn't
have
this
type
of
presumption.
it
doesn't
have
this
type
of
a
shifting
of
a
burden.
and
mullaney
did
have
that.
because
in
mullaney,
to
establish
the
difference
between
murder
and
manslaughter
was
malice.
but
malice
was
presumed,
and
the
jury
was
instructed
that
malice
was
presumed.
and
once
that
presumption
came
into
effect,
the
defendant,
to
get
the
benefit
of
a
reduction,
had
to
establish
the
absence
of
malice,
which
was
the
state's
burden
to
establish.
and
that
was
really
where
the
statute
became
unconstitutional,
and
that's
why
this
court
took
the
action.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
don't
think
a
statute
like
that
would,
perhaps,
pass
constitutional
muster.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
well,
it
could
and
it
could
not.
it
depends
on
how
the
elements
were
framed.
because
under
this
court's
analysis
in
patterson,
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
elements
of
the
state's
case,
and
whether
or
not
there
was
any
direct
relationship
to
the
elements
of
the
affirmative
defense.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
that's
fine.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
it
would
be
fine.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
you're
inviting
me,
justice,
to
speculate
as
to
why
the
ohio
legislature
drafted
its
law.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
acquittal.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes.
the
burden
of
proof
of
the
defendant
isn't
very
heavy
in
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
that's
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
winship
involved
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
as
to
every
fact
necessary
for
which
the
state
had
to
prove.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
the
defense
is
different.
there's
no
direct
relationship
to
the
winship
rationale
in
your
hypothetical.
so
therefore--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes,
yes.
and
the
ohio
statute
was
enacted--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--not
really.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
not
really
a
strained
interpretation.
but
the
ohio
statute
was
enacted
approximately
1-1/2
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
patterson
v.
new
york.
and
i
think
this
is
the
key
case,
is
patterson.
again,
the
issue
in
patterson
was
whether
the
due
process
clause
required
states
to
assume
the
burden
of
disproving
affirmative
defenses
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
rejecting
this
constitutional
argument,
patterson
cited
to
leland,
and
observed
the
following.
again,
that
the
new
york
statute
in
question
require
that
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
on
the
state
to
establish
its
elements
of
the
crime;
and
second,
that
the
jury
was
instructed
that
the
defendant
was
presumed
innocent.
patterson
undertook
a
quite
extensive
historical
approach
to
the
entire
question,
noting
that
in
common
law,
affirmative
defenses
and
the
burden
of
proving
these
defenses,
were
properly
placed
on
the
defendant.
the
historical
approach
further
indicated
that
this
was
the
rule
when
the
fifth
amendment
was
adopted
and
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
ratified.
patterson
is
literally
a
gold
mine
of
some
of
the
most
beautiful
constitutional
quotations
ever
issued
from
this
court.
patterson
stresses,
for
example,
that
affirmative
defenses
are
matters
separate
from
the
elements
of
the
crime.
they
are
matters
of
exception
and
not
negation.
secondly,
there's
an
implicit
recognition
in
patterson
that
the
defendants,
not
the
prosecution,
are
in
the
best
position
to
know
the
defense
that
these
individuals
seek
to
assert.
and
lastly,
there
was
an
explicit
recognition
that
the
states
may
define
their
crimes,
regulate
their
procedures,
and
also,
to
regulate
the
burdens
of
proof
as
they
see
fit.
the
conclusion
that
i'd
like
to
make
that
ohio
law,
like
patterson,
contains
numerous
similarities
both
to
the
patterson
decision
and
the
leland
decision.
for
example,
the
ohio
law
explicitly
states
that
the
burden
of
proof
for
all
elements
of
the
crime
is
on
the
state.
and
this
was
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury.
secondly,
the
ohio
statute
has
a
built-in
factor
that
every
person
is
presumed
innocent.
and
we
would
have
it
no
other
way.
third,
that
self-defense
was
a
separate
issue
under
ohio
law,
and
a
recognition
that
it
was
a
common
law
approach.
and
fourth,
that
the
ohio
statute,
and
the
elements
of
the
crime,
bear
no
direct
relationship
to
the
elements
of
the
affirmative
defense.
patterson
is
significant
because
it
stresses
that
in
determining
what
facts
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
state
legislature's
definition
of
the
elements
of
the
defense
is
usually
dispositive.
consequently,
patterson
establishes
a
bright
line
standard
to
be
applied,
and
it's
a
twofold
test.
number
one,
first
you
look
to
the
determination
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
for
which
the
petitioner
was
convicted.
aggravated
murder
in
ohio
consists
of
three
elements,
and
that's
coming
from
state
v.
martin:
it's
purposeful,
which
is
the
criminal
intent
portion
of
the
statute,
which
means
a
specific
intention
to
kill;
prior
calculation
and
design;
and
lastly,
causing
the
death
of
another.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
no,
you
can
have
situations
where--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--no.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes.
when
a
person
says
that
i
killed,
he
admits
an
act.
so
he
does
admit
doing
an
act
purposefully.
but
it's
not
a
negation
of
purposefulness.
so
there's
no
direct
relationship
between
the
two.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
think
you
have
to
look
to
the
facts--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--i
think
you
have
to
look
to
the
facts
in
this
particular
situation.
here's
a
73-year-old--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--it
goes
to
purposefulness
in
the
sense
that
a
person
who
admits
that
he
acted
in
self-defense
admits
that
he
did
an
act.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
well,
it's
a
legislative
statute--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--i
understand
that,
justice
white,
but
i
don't
see
that
there
is
a
direct
relationship.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
at
what
time?
mr.
george
j.
sadd
no,
i
think
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
statute,
ohio
recognized
a
murder
in
the
first
degree
statute
similar
to
the
one
statute
that
was
placed
in
oregon.
and
the
state
had
to
prove
premeditation,
deliberation,
and
intent.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
it
was
changed,
i
believe,
in
1974.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
1974.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes.
and
that's
the
three
elements
that
are
gleaned--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--what...
i
didn't
get
your
question?
mr.
george
j.
sadd
he
would,
again,
have
to
prove
the
elements
of
self-defense,
which
are
three
factors:
that
he
was
not
the
aggressor;
number
two,
that
he
had
an
imminent
danger
of
death
or
great
bodily
harm,
an
honest
belief
that
it
would
happen,
and
that
the
only
method
of
escaping
from
that
danger
was
the
use
of
force;
and
lastly,
that
he
had
not
violate
any
duty
to
retreat
or
escape
the
danger.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
in
1974.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
oh,
the
current
statute
now
has
been
enacted
in
1978,
a
year
and
a
half
after
this
court's
decision
in
patterson.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes,
it
did.
because
in
1974,
ohio
did
assume
the
burden
for
a
two-year
period
of
disproving
the
affirmative
defense.
and
then
ohio
changed
it
approximately
a
year
and
a
half
later,
after
this
court's
decision
in
patterson.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes,
yes,
there
would
be.
but
you
calculate
into
this
case,
even
they
denied...
even
if
the
defendant
in
this
particular
case
denied
that
her
purpose
was
to
kill,
the
state's
evidence
established
that
she
shot
her
husband
six
times
while
he
was
talking
on
the
phone.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
you
probably
could,
justice
scalia.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
self-defense
claim
was
bogus,
that
she
had--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--sure.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
absolutely.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
that's
a
correct
interpretation.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes.
i
don't
think
having
a
burden
is
anything
laborious,
as
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
has
once
said,
and
i
think
it
was
in
mullaney,
he
said
that
individuals
at
time
do
have
to
carry
a
laborious
oar,
and
have
to
peddle
this
laborious
oar,
and
that
laborious
oar
is
a
burden.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
no,
no.
he
would
put
that
in
on
his
case
in
chief.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
purposefulness.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
you're
not
negating
purpose
with
this.
i
think
that's
where
we're
having
a
disagreement.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
let
me
give
you
the
following
hypothetical,
which
may
clarify
matters.
suppose
an
individual
went
into
a
bar.
and
while
he
was
inside
this
bar,
the
victim
spilled
a
drink
on
his
coat,
and
the
defendant
then
said
to
customers
inside
the
bar,
that
this
guy
tried
to
kill
me
and
i'm
going
to...
i
mean,
this
guy
spilled
a
drink
on
me;
i'm
going
to
kill
him.
goes
outside
to
his
car,
pulls
out
a
gun,
comes
back
in.
the
witnesses
see
this,
and
even
the
victim
sees
him
with
a
gun.
and
the
victim
charges
him,
and
the
defendant
then
shoots
and
kills
him.
it
could
be
said
under
that
hypothetical
that
a
person
could
have
acted
with
prior
calculation
and
design
and
purposefulness,
as
well
as
acting
in
self-defense.
it
becomes
a
jury
question,
how
to
resolve
the
question.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes,
i
would
submit
that
the
elements
of
self-defense,
in
this
particular
case,
do
not
conflict
with
the
elements
of
aggravated
murder
in
this
particular
case
under
ohio
law.
and
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
portion
of
my
argument
to
simply
state
that,
in
rejecting
the
due
process
argument,
patterson
explicitly
states
that
the
proof
of
nonexistence
of
all
affirmative
defenses
has
never
been
constitutionally
required,
and
we
perceive
no
reason
to
fashion
such
a
rule
in
this
case
and
apply
it
to
the
statutory
defense
at
issue
here.
finally,
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
both
in
patterson,
and
more
recently
in
mcmillian
v.
pennsylvania,
that
states
enjoy
wide
latitude
in
the
definition
of
their
crimes,
the
regulation
of
their
procedures
under
which
its
laws
are
carried
out,
including
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
and
the
burden
of
persuasion.
this
is
so,
because
as
mcmillian
recognizes,
the
preventing
and
dealing
with
crime
is
much
more
the
business
of
the
states
than
the
federal
government.
ohio
submits
that
it
may
constitutionally
impose
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
number
one,
the
defendant
is
in
the
best
position,
superior
to
the
prosecutor,
to
know
and
prove
the
defense
that
they
assert.
number
two,
ohio
has
chosen
to
place
a
higher
burden
of
criminal
responsibility
on
those
who
wish
to
establish
affirmative
defenses.
and
lastly,
to
make
it
more
difficult
and
to
eliminate
false
claims
of
self-defense.
we
would
conclude
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
mandate
that
the
prosecution
disprove
affirmative
defenses
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
this
is
the
more
reasonable
approach,
rather
than
requiring
the
states
to
disprove
negatives.
i
thank
you
very,
very
much.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
--correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
well,
i
think,
the
state
has
not
proved
anybody...
the
defendant
in
the
state
of
ohio's
scheme
is
not
to
prove
themselves
innocent.
they
interpose
a
defense.
and
that
defense
is
recognized
in
2901.35,
which
reads,
an
affirmative
defense
is
a
defense
involving
an
excuse
or
a
justification
within
the
knowledge
of
the
accused
in
which
he
can
fairly
be
required
to
adduce
supporting
evidence.
thank
you.
