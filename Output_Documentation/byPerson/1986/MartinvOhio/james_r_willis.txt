mr.
james
r.
willis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue,
simply
put,
in
this
case
is
whether
ohio
can
punish
one
as
a
murder
when
it
is
just
as
likely
that
they
acted
in
self-defense.
to
more
properly
isolate
the
issue,
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
this
case
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
defendant
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
she
acted
in
self-defense
by
the
greater
weight
of
the
evidence.
the
court
went
on
to
indicate
that
the
defendant
must
establish
that
the
other
party
was
the
aggressor,
and
the
defendant
did
not
herself
provoke
or
cause
the
injury.
the
court
then
further
indicated
that
if
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
equally
balanced,
or
if
you
are
unable
to
determine
which
side
has
the
affirmative
defense
as
to...
has
the
preponderance,
then
the
defendant
has
not
establish
such
affirmative
defense.
in
essence,
what
the
court
was
telling
the
jury,
that
if
the
evidence
was
in
equipoise
on
the
issue
of
self-defense,
then
the
defendant
had
failed
to
establish
her
defense.
the
critical
aspect
of
this
was
that
this
was
the
defendant's
sole
defense.
so
in
effect,
the
ohio
law
can
be
understood
as
indicating
that
ohio
can,
in
fact,
require
a
defendant
to
prove
themselves
not
guilty.
i
think
this
offends
principles
that
have
been
in--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--yes,
in
one
aspect
it
does.
mr.
james
r.
willis
well,
certainly
self-defense
is
directed
against
the
element
of
purposefulness,
unlawfulness,
in
the
context
of
the
ohio
statute.
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes,
it
has
to
do
that.
mr.
james
r.
willis
absolutely.
mr.
james
r.
willis
that's
exactly
what
it's
saying.
mr.
james
r.
willis
but
it's
saying
that
the
defendant
has
to
prove,
by
the
same
token,
that
he's
not
guilty.
the
point
is
that
self-defense
is
different
from
all
other
defenses.
what
the
defendant
is
saying
when
he
asserts
self-defense
is
that
he
was
engaged
in
lawful
conduct,
and
that
he
has
a
right
not
to
be
punished
for
having
done
this.
mr.
james
r.
willis
it
certainly
does,
in
the
context
where
you
have
a
case
that
has
a
self-defense
component.
and
certainly,
when
the
issue
of
self-defense
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
it
certainly
ought
to
be
submitted
under
proper
instructions.
the
critical
point,
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
james
r.
willis
it
absolutely
did.
because
inherent
in
that
instruction,
of
course,
is
the
presumption
that
what
the
defendant
did
was
unlawful,
and
i
can
develop
that.
back
in
1872,
or
thereabouts,
there
was
a
case
in
ohio
known
as
silvers,
which
referred
to
some
common
law
cases
out
of
england,
the
forest
crown
cases
and
king
v.
winoncby,
and
at
that
point,
in
the
silvers
case,
the
defendant
requested
an
instruction
that
the
jury
be
told
that
the
defendant...
that
the
state
had
to
prove
the
lack
of
self-defense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
court
in
its...
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
indicated
that
that
would
eliminate
the
presumption
that
what
the
defendant
had
done
was
unlawful.
now,
that
presumption
is
the
same
presumption
that
this
court
has
declared
unconstitutional
in
such
cases
as
sandstrom,
franklin
v.
francis,
and
other
cases.
we
know
that
even
in
england,
in
1937,
the...
the
house
of
lords
indicated
that
that
reading
of
these
english
cases
was
wrong;
and
that
those
cases,
the
forest
crown
cases
and
others,
had
indicated
that
the
burden
was
on...
the
defendant
had
to
prove
the
lack
of
provocation.
and
given
that
context,
which
is
referred
to
in
mullaney,
we
now
know
from
this
court,
as
i
indicated,
in
sandstrom
and
in
franklin,
that
the
presumption
is
an
unconstitutional
one.
so
the
state
of
ohio
is
getting
the
benefit
of
that
presumption.
and
it's
interesting--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--that
is
the
premise
of
my
argument.
mr.
james
r.
willis
deliberate
and
premeditated
malice.
mr.
james
r.
willis
because
self-defense
is
one
of
those
fundamental
or
inalienable
rights
that
were
part
of
the
rights
that
the
people
had
when
this
union
was
formed.
more
specifically,
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
george
mason,
who
wrote
the
declaration...
the
virginia
declaration
and
the
virginia
constitution,
indicated
that
there
were
certain
rights
that
the
people
possessed
almost
absolutely
that
could
not
be
traversed.
about
weeks
later,
this
was
engulfed
by
madison
and
written
into
the
declaration
of
independence.
this
then
tells
us...
and
then
in
the
preamble
to
the
constitution,
also
written
by
madison,
we
have
inalienable
rights.
mr.
james
r.
willis
well,
i
think
you
have
the
right--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--i
think--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--in
ohio,
they
would
have
to
show
that
you
didn't
precipitate
the
controversy
that
gave
rise
to
the
need,
to
the
necessity
of
self-defense.
you
must
not
have
violated
any
duty
to
retreat,
and
you
must
not
have
used
no
more
force
that
was
reasonably
necessary.
mr.
james
r.
willis
under
the
circumstances.
although,
you
have
the
right
to
act
on
appearances,
and
even
if
you're
mistaken
in
those
appearances,
if
in
fact
you
believe
that
you
are
confronted
with
a
situation
where
you
might
suffer
death
or
grievous
bodily
harm,
then
you
can
act,
and
the
jury
would
be
compelled
to
acquit
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
james
r.
willis
absolutely.
i
think
this
court
said
that
in
speiser
v.
randall.
it
referred
to
it
again
in
mcmillian
and
patterson.
and
i'm
convinced
that
there
are
limits
beyond
which
a
state
cannot
go
in
defining
its
crimes
and
in
allocatings
its
burdens
of
proof.
indeed,
this
court
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
there
are
certain
facts
that
need
not
be
elements
that
have
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
statement
was
recently
indicated
in
mcmillian
where
it
interpreted
patterson
as
having
given
rise
to
that
position.
and
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
here.
now,
the
state
of
ohio
has
indicated
that
if
you
prove
points...
prove
fact
a,
b,
c
and
d,
that
you
have
proved
unlawful
conduct;
and
therefore,
when
you
raise
the
issue
of
self-defense,
if
you
are
challenging
exclusively
unlawfulness,
that
you
are
not
challenging
any
of
the
elements
in
patterson.
well,
let's
deal
with
patterson.
patterson
was
a
situation
where
new
york
created
a
gratuitous
defense.
it
was
created
by
legislative
grace.
the
effect
of
patterson
was
that
a
particular
crime
was
designated
as
murder.
however,
the
defendant
was
given
the
right
to
reduce
that
crime
from
murder
to
manslaughter
upon
certain
proof.
as
i
read
patterson,
what
this
court
said
was
that
it
is
all
right,
and
due
process
considerations
are
not
offended,
if
new
york
elects
to
convict
one
as
a
murderer
when
it
it
just
as
likely
that
they
were
acting...
that
they
only
committed
manslaughter
because
they
were
acting
under
extreme
emotional
stress.
this
is
to
be
distinguished
from
what
ohio's
done.
ohio
has
said,
you
can
convict
one
as
a
murderer
when
it
is
just
as
likely
that
they
were
acting
in
self-defense.
now,
if
self-defense
is
a
basic
right,
and
i
contend
that
it
is,
then
something
benefits
the
defendant,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
the
state
should
prove
that
he
was
not
acting
in
self-defense.
it's
significant
that
48
of
the
50
states
require
the
state
to
ultimately
carry
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
that
issue.
some
of
the
states,
maine
and
a
few
others
that
we
can
possibly
name,
have
indicated
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
production,
that
he
has
to
establish
that
there
is
enough
evidence
in
the
case
to
create
the
issue.
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
accept
that
proposition.
i
agree
with
that.
that's
not
the
issue,
but
i
adopt
it,
the
inference
in
the
court's
question.
and
we
do
not
question
the
fact
that
the
defendant
ought
to
be
burdened
with
that
of
production.
but
once
the
issue
is
in
the
case,
it
just
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
state
ought
to
be
able...
ought
to
be
required,
under
fundamental
criteria,
to
prove
that
the
defendant
was
not
acting
in
self-defense.
as
i
said,
48
of
the
50
states
require
this.
now,
the
state
is
talking
in
terms
of
the
difficulty
in
doing
this.
even
the
united...
even
in
the
federal
courts,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
lack
of
self-defense,
and
i
do
not
quarrel
with
this.
mr.
james
r.
willis
well,
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
under
which
the
killing
took
place.
if
it's
a
life
and
death
struggle
between
two
people,
then
obviously,
he
may
very
well
intend
to
kill.
but
that's
the
problem
with
martin
v.
ohio.
martin
v.
ohio,
the
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
is
to
the
effect
that
self-defense
is
likened
to
confession
and
avoidance.
they
state
that
when
one
claims
self-defense,
he
admits
the
facts
as
alleged
by
the
prosecutor.
well,
certainly,
one
can
kill
in
self-defense
without
intending
to
kill.
he
can
shoot
to
wound
in
self-defense.
he
can
shoot
to
scare
in
self-defense.
it
can
be
a
reflex
action
in
self-defense
without
any
particular
purpose
whatsoever.
are
we
to
say
that
mens
re
has
no...
that
self-defense
doesn't
impact
on
mens
re?
well,
certainly
it
does.
that's--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--absolutely.
they
have
to
prove
that
there
was
an
intent
to
kill.
mr.
james
r.
willis
because
he
was
acting...
he
did
so...
she
did
so,
if
it
please
the
court,
while
she
was
acting
in
self-defense.
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
under
these
facts
that
we--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--that
we
concern
ourselves
with
the
propriety
of
the
instruction
that
control
the
ultimate
verdict
that
was
rendered
by
the
court...
rendered
by
the
jury.
now,
back
to
my
concern
about
patterson.
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes.
mr.
james
r.
willis
well,
in
that
context,
you
would
simply
have
to
look
at
the
circumstantial
evidence
to
the
same
extent
the
state
would
have
to
look
at...
rely
on
circumstantial
evidence
to
prove
the
contrary.
mr.
james
r.
willis
i've
seen
it
done.
and
so
therefore
i
believe
it
can
be
done.
mr.
james
r.
willis
and
they
also
find
that
it
was
not
done
in
self-defense,
then
that's
a
valid
verdict,
as
i
perceive
it.
and
i
would
have
no
problem
whatsoever
with
accepting
that.
and
had
that
happened
here,
i
would
not
be
here.
but
i
really
want
to
make
this
point
involving...
involving
patterson.
and
it
goes
back
to
the
question
asked
by
justice
scalia.
if
this
case
is
truly
analogous
to
patterson,
and
if
it's
controlled
by
patterson
and
not
by
mullaney,
new
york
can
eliminate
the
statute
that
created
that
gratuitous
or
mitigating
defense.
are
we
to
say,
then,
that
ohio
can
likewise
eliminate,
by
statute,
the
right
of
self-defense?
now,
we
talk
in
terms
of
the
right
to
self-defense.
it's
significant
that
nowhere
in
the
ohio
statutes
is
that
right
written
in.
what
the
ohio
statute
says
on
affirmative
defenses
is,
simply
put,
that
the
defendant
shall
be
burdened
with
proving
self-defenses...
proving
affirmative
defenses.
and
then
we
have
these
cases...
poole,
which
relies
on
silvers,
which
takes
us
back
to
the
english
common
law
cases
which
have
been
repudiated
by
the
house
of
lords.
what
happens,
then,
that
in
ohio
a
defendant
is
burdened
to
this
extent:
if
the
state
produces
evidence
that
a
crime
occurred,
a
homicide
occurred,
ohio
is
willing
to
say
that
if
you
raise
the
defense
of
self-defense,
it's
confession
and
avoidance.
and
i
think
that's
inappropriate.
i
think
it's
wrong.
i
don't
think
that
the
defendant,
simply
by
raising
the
defense
of
self-defense,
admits
that
what
she
did
would
be
unlawful.
what
she's
saying
is,
that
i
committed
an
act
which
was
innocent.
i
was
defending
myself
under
the
circumstances
that
i
was
currently
confronted
with;
and
that
my
actions
were
lawful,
and
the
state
ought
to
be
required
to
prove
to
the
contrary.
mr.
james
r.
willis
no,
you
don't
have
to
say,
i
plead
guilty.
but
if
you
read
martin,
that's
the
essence
of
what
they're
saying.
they're
saying
that
self-defense
seeks
to...
to
justify
admitted
conduct.
now,
we
admit
that
we
shot
and
killed
this
man.
but
we
don't
admit
that
that
was
criminal.
so
to
say,
as
the
state
of
ohio
said
in
davis,
which
was
state
v.
davis,
which
was
relied
on
in
state
v.
martin,
and
davis
came
from
the
same
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
did
martin,
and
was
cited
in
that
case
as
well,
if
that's
a
valid
premise,
that
the
defendant
is
admitting
that
she
did
an
act
which
would
otherwise
be
unlawful
and
then
seeks
to
justify
it,
that's
the
essence
of
what
she's
doing.
she's
pleading...
she's
actually
pleading
guilty.
she's
saying,
i'm
guilty
if
i
don't
prove
i
acted
in
self-defense.
the
opposite
of
that
is
that
she
then
has
to
prove
herself
innocent,
and
that
runs
afoul,
as
i
see
it,
to
all
the
cases
that
this
court
has
ever
decided,
including
patterson
and
even
leland--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--she
plead,
not
guilty.
her
defense
was
absolutely
self-defense.
mr.
james
r.
willis
that's
exactly
what
the
trial
court
did.
and
the
court
submitted,
as
i
might
add,
the
included
offenses
of
manslaughter
and...
murder
and
manslaughter
coming
down.
and
of
course
the
court
instructed
the
jury
on
self-defense
with
reference
to
all
of
those
issues.
so--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--i
think
it
is,
and
that's
precisely
my
point.
and
it's
interesting
that
this
court
has
said
that
there
are
certain
fundamental
concepts
that
the
state
can't
traverse
upon--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--i
think
the
answer
is
provided
with
an
historical
perspective.
we
can
go
back
to
where
was
self-defense
first
developed.
it
was
developed
out
the
jury
nullification
concept.
because
there
was
no
right
of
self-defense
way
back
yonder
in
the
common
law.
but
the
jurors
would
simply
not
convict
in
certain
circumstances.
and
i
take
it
obviously
would
be...
some
of
those
circumstances
would
include
those
where
it
was
obvious
that
the
accused
had
no
choice.
so
the
murder
charge
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
simply
would
not
convict.
so
early
on
in
the
common
law,
the
concept
of
self-defense
developed.
so
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
scalia,
jurors
would
not
convict
under
those
circumstances,
because
traditionally,
we
have
recognized
that
we
have
the
right
of
self-defense.
when
the
constitution
talks
about
inalienable
rights,
what
are
they
talking
about?
when
this
court
says
that
there
are
certain
limits
beyond
which
the
states
cannot
go
in
allocating
burdens
and
in
defining
its
crimes...
even
in
mcmillian,
as
late
as
this
last
term,
the
court
didn't
tell
us
what
those...
what
they
were
talking
about,
and
so
commented
in
the
opinion.
we
have
admitted
that
there
are
certain
limits,
but
we
haven't
defined
those
limits.
this
case
gives
the
court
an
apt
opportunity
to
define
those
limits.
and
i
take--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--they
had
the
ninth
amendment,
which
said
that
there
are
certain
rights
reserved
to
the
people.
mr.
james
r.
willis
well,
i
certainly
am
not
privvy
to
what
the
court
has
read
in
this
area.
and
i'm
sure
it's
far
more
extensive
than
my
reading.
i
haven't
run
into
it
in
any
specific
case.
so
if
i'm
to
be
credited
for
having
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
asserting
that
it's
inalienable
and
that
it's
fundamental,
then
so
be
it.
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
can
still
win
the
case.
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
can
still
win
the
case
on
the
theory
that
self-defense
is
different.
it's
certainly
different
from
insanity.
it's
different
from
duress.
because
in
all
those
instances,
the
defendant
is
saying
he's
not
guilty.
in
patterson,
the
defendant
was
not
saying
he
was
not
guilty.
he
was
saying,
i
didn't
commit
murder.
in
mullaney
the
defendant
was
not
saying,
i'm
not
guilty.
the
defendant
was
saying
that
i
committed
a
lesser
charge.
mr.
james
r.
willis
i'm
not
guilty.
i
committed
no--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--no,
no,
i
didn't
commit
a
crime.
i
really
would
like
to
reserve
any
time
that
i
have
to
respond--
mr.
james
r.
willis
--absolutely.
that
is
the
difference
between
mitigation
and
justification,
and
that's
the
argument
that
i
make
to
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
ohio's
self-defense
law
has
not
changed
since
1870-something.
they
did
change
the
homicide
law.
there
is
no
statutory
enactment,
never
has
been
a
statutory
enactment
whereby
self-defense
is
defined.
the
definition
of
self-defense
in
ohio
comes
from
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
its
opinions
in
silvers,
abner
and
as
late
as
melchiar.
the
other
interesting
aspect
of
the
prosecutor's
argument
is
when
he
analogizes...
i'm
sorry,
leland
v.
oregon,
the
insanity
case,
to
the
facts
here.
in
an
insanity
case,
the
jury's
verdict
is,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
or
guilty,
but
mentally
ill.
a
defendant
in
an
insanity
case
commits
a
crime
which,
if
committed
by
a
sane
person,
would
be,
indeed,
a
crime.
he's
claiming
that
he
is
not
blameworthy
because
he
lacked
the...
because
he
lacked
the
appropriate
mens
re
because
of
his
lack
of
mental
competency.
i
think
it's
also
significant
with
reference
to
the
hypothetical
that
mr.
sadd
gave
us.
under
that
hypothetical,
in
ohio,
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
self-defense.
because
he
would
not
have
done
anything
he
could
do
to
avoid
the
danger.
when
the
man
says,
he's
going
out
to
get
a
gun,
under
ohio
law,
he
has
a
duty
to
retreat.
he's
got
to
leave
that
bar.
he's
got
to
call
the
police.
he's
got
to
barricade
himself
somewhere.
so
under
that
hypothetical,
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
defense.
self-defense
and
prior
calculation
and
design
simply
cannot
coexist.
and
to
the
extent
that
self-defense
operates
in
counter-distinction
to
prior
calculation
and
design,
it's
an
element.
and
to
that
extent,
in
ohio,
we
feel
that
the
law
is
wrong
on
self-defense.
there
are
three
points
with
reference
to
our
position:
self-defense
negates
the
element
of
criminal
purpose.
certainly,
the
state
in
this
instance,
has
exceeded
those
constitutional
limits
this
court
spoke
about
in
speiser.
and
what
the
defendant
engaged
in
in
this
case
was
truly
lawful
conduct.
thank
you.
