chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
earline
martin
against
ohio.
mr.
willis,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly,
that's
not
unreasonable,
is
it?
because
most
of
the
time
the
defendant
would
have
that
knowledge
far
better
than
the
state?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
willis,
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
of
ohio
does
not
allow
a
defendant
to
plead
self-defense
unless
the
defendant
pleads
guilty
to
the
substantive
elements
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
client
did
not
plead
guilty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
trial
court
required
the
state
to
prove
the
elements
of
murder
against
her,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
willis.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
sadd.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opponent,
mr.
willis,
contends,
of
course,
that
self-defense
isn't
like
insanity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
know,
how
much
do
you
say,
or
how
much
ground
do
you
really
cover,
when
you
say
it's
a
separate
matter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
in
mullaney,
the
state
had
structured
the
statute
correctly,
as
i
recall
it.
everything
was
murder,
and
all
you
showed
was
a
homicide.
and
then
everything
else
was
a
matter
of
affirmative
defense.
and
the
court
said,
you
can't
do
that
under
the
due
process
clause.
you
can't
wholly
stack
the
equation
on
the
side
of
affirmative
defenses.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sadd.
mr.
willis,
do
you
have
something
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
willis.
the
case
is
submitted.
