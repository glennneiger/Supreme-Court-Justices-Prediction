mr.
kroop,
what
if
an
arrest
warrant
were
put
out
for
a
specific
individual
and
the
police
in
fact
arrested
someone
who
matched
the
description
but
didn't
turn
out
to
be
in
fact
the
one
arrested,
and
they
search,
and
in
the
process
discover
drugs.
justice
sandra

o'connor
mistake
of
fact.
reasonable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
don't
we
apply
exactly
the
same
sort
of
thing
with
the
search
of
the
premises,
a
reasonable
mistake?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
shouldn't
we?
is
there
any
reason
not
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
are
talking
about
a
warrant
and
whether
there
is
room
for
making
a
reasonable
mistake
when
all
the
outward
circumstances
would
indicate
there
is
one
apartment
on
the
third
floor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kroop,
what
if
the
policeman
who
goes
to
get
the
warrant
is
acting
on
the
basis
of
information
given
him
by
a
reliable
informant
who
happens
to
be
wrong,
dead
wrong,
but
the
informant
says
you
will
find
the
marijuana
in
mr.
garrison's
apartment.
a
warrant
is
obtained
for
garrison's
apartment
and
the
police
search
pursuant
to
it.
now,
that
is
a
mistake
made
by
the
police--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
we
are
going
to
hold
that
that
is
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
get
the
warrant
for
the
garrison
apartment--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
it
has
been
on
a
mistake
made
by
the
police
and
their
informant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
we
have
said
that
is
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
is
a
case
of
a
reasonable
mistake
that
is
comparable
to
what
is
being
urged
here,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
you
were
taking
the
position
that
we
had
never
permitted
a
mistake
of
fact
on
the
part
of
the
police
or
their
informants--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
reach
into
the
premises.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
franks
versus
delaware.
