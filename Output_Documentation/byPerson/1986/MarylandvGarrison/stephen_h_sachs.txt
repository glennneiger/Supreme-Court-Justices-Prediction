mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
which
reversed
the
conviction
of
respondent
garrison
because
in
the
judgment
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
the
evidence
necessary
to
sustain
that
conviction
was
the
product
of
an
unconstitutional
search
of
respondent
garrison's
apartment.
the
search
and
seizure
warrant
in
question
issued
by
a
district
court
judge,
state
judge
in
baltimore
issued
for
the
person
of
one
lawrence
mcwebb,
a
suspected
marijuana
dealer,
and
his
premises,
2036
park
avenue,
third
floor
apartment.
it
was
issued,
we
believe
respondent
concedes,
with
ample
probable
cause
for
mcwebb
and
for
that
search.
it
was
issued,
however,
on
the
assumption
and
executed
on
the
assumption
that
only
one
apartment
existed
on
the
third
floor
at
2036
park
avenue
and
it
was
the
apartment
of
mcwebb.
it
turned
out
that
that
assumption
was,
in
the
words
of
hill
v.
california,
quite
wrong.
there
were
two
apartments,
one
mcwebb's,
the
other
garrison's,
and
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
police
behavior
here
in
this
case
falls
within
the
margin
for
reasonable
error
allowable
by
the
fourth
amendment
as
recognized
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
like
hill
against
california,
in
brineger,
and
in
others.
we
submit
that
the
conduct
of
the
police
here
clearly
does
fall
within
that
reasonableness
standard.
it
is
helpful,
we
think,
your
honors,
to
analyze
what
the
police
did
here
in
three
separate
stages,
the
investigation
stage
which
led
to
the
obtaining
and
issuance
of
the
warrant,
the
arrival
at
2036
park
avenue,
arrival
at
the
premises,
and
finally
the
entry
into
the
third
floor
premises
themselves.
each
of
these
stages
reinforced,
we
submit,
the
assumption
at
the
beginning
that
there
was
one
apartment
on
the
third
floor
and
it
was
mcwebb's,
and
each
of
these
stages,
we
also
submit,
your
honors,
was
dominated
by
a
crucial
fact,
an
overwhelming
fact,
a
central
fact
that
categorized,
characterized
each
stage.
in
the
first
stage
the
verification
from
the
public
utility,
the
baltimore
gas
and
electric
company,
that
there
was
only
one
apartment
on
the
third
floor,
that
was
mcwebb's.
at
the
second
stage
it
was
the
arrival
of
mcwebb
himself,
the
very
subject
of
the...
intended
subject
of
the
search,
who
arrived
on
the
scene
fortuitously.
he
had
been
out
of
his
apartment,
came
to
the
scene,
and
in
effect
led
the
officers
up
the
stairs.
and
finally,
in
the
third
stage,
it
was
the
appearance
of
the
premises
once
the
police
went
through
the
door,
which
we
suggest
gave
the
appearance
for
all
the
world
that
this
is
one
apartment
and
only
one
apartment.
now,
the
facts
begin
with
a
tip
from
an
informant
of
officer
marcus
that
the
informant
had
been
buying
marijuana
for
a
long
time,
i
believe,
six
months
from
someone
he
knew
as
red
cross,
street
name
red
cross,
from
his
apartment
on
the
third
floor
of
2036
park
avenue.
the
informant
said
nothing
about
the
existence
on
that
floor
of
two
separate
apartments.
the
informant,
had
bought
marijuana
as
recently
as
the
day
before
officer
marcus
proceeds
to
get
his
affidavit.
officer
marcus
then
does
an
eminently
reasonable
thing.
he
checks
with...
first,
he
looks
at
the
premises,
sees
that
it
is
a
three-story
brick
building
with
2036
on
the
outside,
which
the
informant
had
said,
and
then
he
checks
with
the
public
utility.
he
calls
up
the
baltimore
gas
and
electric
company
to
find
out
who
lived
on
the
third
floor.
all
he
had
was
the
street
name,
red
cross.
and
he
recites
in
his
affidavit
for
the
warrant
that
he
called
and
he
discovered,
he
says
the
word
2036,
third
floor,
was
in
the
name
of
lawrence
mcwebb.
he
on
examination
at
the
motion
to
suppress...
officer
marcus
says
he
expressly
asked
baltimore
gas
and
electric
company,
was
there
a
front
and
a
middle
and
a
back,
or
words
very
much
to
that
effect,
and
"they
told
me",
and
this
is
a
quote
from
marcus
in
the
suppression
hearing,
"they
told
me",
he
says,
"one
third
floor
was
only
listed
to
lawrence
mcwebb.
"
not
perhaps
the
most
grammatical
or
artful
expression
of
what
we
think
the
evidence
is
clear
it
meant.
what
he
was
saying
was,
there
is
only
one
guy
who
lives
there,
there
is
only
one
apartment,
it
is
mcwebb--
mcwebb
to
the
informant.
he
says
that
is
red
cross.
and
marcus
gets
his
warrant.
it
is
difficult,
may
i
suggest
at
this
stage,
your
honor,
to
imagine
a
police
officer
acting
more
reasonably
under
the
precedents
of
this
court
and
the
preference
for
the
warrant
requirement
and
the
reasons
for
it
in
the
first
place.
of
course,
he
could
have
done
more.
he
could
have
checked
with
the
phone
company,
i
suppose.
he
could
have
made
supplementary
checks.
but
the
mistake
here
was
the
mistake,
we
suggest,
of
bg&e.
it
was
not
the
mistake
of
the
police.
his
reliance
on
that
mistake
was
appropriate
and
was
consistent
with
the
informant.
there
was
no
reason
to
question,
and
the
bg&e
was
indeed
the
verification,
as
the
court
of
special
appeals
in
this
case
held,
the
verification
of
the
information
that
he
needed.
stage
two
is
the
arrival
at
the
premises,
2036,
of
the
police
raiding
party.
while
officer
shea,
one
of
the
first
officer
on
the
scene,
was
examining
the
outside
door
to
the
premises,
the
exterior
door
that
led
to
the
street,
and
was
trying
to
gain
entry
into
that
door
without
breaking
it
down...
at
one
point
he
said
he
punched
all
seven
bells
to
try
to
get
somebody
to
press
the
release
buzzer...
so
he
could
get
in
without
breaking
down
the
door.
while
that
is
going
on...
and
incidentally
he
testified
and
the
court
found
as
a
fact
that
mcwebb's
name
was
at
none
of
those
bells...
while
that
is
going
on,
who
should
arrive
but
mcwebb
himself,
by
vehicle.
he
is
detained,
of
course.
he
is
informed
of
the
search
warrant,
of
course,
and
what
then
happens
is,
he
leads
the
raiding
party...
his
key
is
used
to
open
the
exterior
door.
he
leads
the
raiding
party
up
the...
into
the
first
floor,
onto
the
second
floor
landing,
onto
the
third
floor,
and
it
is
his
key
that
opens
the
door
to
the
third
floor
apartment
as
it
appeared
to
the
police
at
that
time.
significantly,
on
the
way
up
and
throughout
this
entire
episode
mcwebb
never
says,
my
apartment
is
third
floor
rear.
never
does
he
indicate
that
there
are
two
apartments.
never,
as
we
will
see
in
a
moment,
does
garrison
so
indicate.
but
as
they
are
going
up
these
stairs
the
police
are
also
seeing
on
the
first
and
the
second
floor,
the
evidence
shows,
doors
leading
from
the
landings
to
what
must
have
appeared
to
them
to
be
apartments,
but
when
they
get
to
the
third
floor,
this
is
not
the
lady
and
the
tiger.
we
are
not
here
talking
about
options
that
the
police
have.
there
is
one
door
and
one
door
only
on
the
third
floor
appearing
for
all
the
world
to
them
to
be
the
door
of
the
apartment
of
the
man
mcwebb
who
is
the
subject
of
the
search
who
is
now
leading
them
into
the
premises
itself.
there
is
an
interesting--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--absolutely.
absolutely.
officer
marcus...
shea
does
not
recall
in
his
testimony,
your
honor,
whether
there
were
or
were
not
doors
on
the
other
floors,
but
officer
marcus
expressly,
and
we
cite
the
references
at
page
10
of
our
reply
brief,
expressly
talks
about
there
being
"other
doors",
"a
lot
of
doors".
i
think
he
is
talking
about
the
second
floor
in
particular,
perhaps
the
first,
but
certainly
the
third.
i
think
he
is
talking
mostly
the
second
floor,
options,
but
on
the
third
one
door
and
one
door
only.
in
an
exchange
between
counsel
for
garrison,
the
respondent,
and
officer
shea
at
the
motion
to
suppress
counsel
says,
well,
didn't
it
occur
to
you,
officer,
that
as
you
got
to
the
third
floor
there
might
be
more
than
one
apartment?
shea
replies,
not
when
i
saw
that
one
door,
no.
it
is
also
important,
we
suggest,
your
honors,
to
remember
this
in
analyzing
this
case.
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
police
should
have
been
expected
to
ask
as
they
were
proceeding,
should
we,
shouldn't
we.
this
was
not
analysis
of
where
are
we
each
stage
of
the
way.
they
had
a
valid
warrant
as
far
as
they
knew.
they
were
proceeding
up
the
stairs
with
the
very
subject
of
that
warrant.
there
was
not
a
reason
for
them
to
be
self-examining
their
conduct
because
nothing
had
gone
off
to
alert
them
of
the
need
to
do
so.
and
so
here
we
have
at
stage
two
the
arrival
at
the
moment
of
truth
with...
led
by
the
very
subject
of
the
search
itself,
and
now
we
come
through
the
door.
it
is
the
key
of
mcwebb
that
allows
them
to
come
in,
although
officer
marcus
recalled
that
he
thought
garrison
himself
might
have
opened
the
door,
but
what
they
see
when
they
come
in
further
ratifies
and
reinforces
the
assumption
that
they
had
been
making
from
the
beginning,
the
validity
of
this
warrant
for
the
one
apartment
on
the
third
floor.
on
the
right...
they
enter
a
tiny
foyer,
four
by
five
feet,
as
i
think
the
description...
at
the
appendix
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
is
a
diagram,
appendix
page
44
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
what
they
see...
they
are
in
this
small,
tiny
foyer,
and
to
their
right
they
see
an
open
doorway
with
a
bedroom.
to
their
left
they
see
an
open
doorway
with
a
livingroom,
and
no
doors
were
visible.
that
is
a
finding
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
in
this
case.
no
doors
were
visible.
in
fact,
as
it
turns
out
there
were
doors
to
those
two,
doorways,
the
bedroom
and
the
livingroom,
but
they
were
wide
open,
and
they
opened
inward,
and
the
evidence
is,
as
i
say,
the
court
found
as
a
fact
that
no
doors
were
visible.
may
i
also
add
at
this
point,
your
honors,
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
that
it
should
have
seemed
to
them
to
be
one
premises
occupied
by
a
common...
one
apartment.
it
is,
after
all,
and
as
a
matter
of
record
in
this
case,
that
this
had
been
a
building,
as
many
buildings
on
that
block
are,
this
had
been
3
building
that
had
been
a
one-family
building.
this
building
was
built
for
one
family
and
had
been
broken
down
into
apartments,
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
you
should
not
have
in
your
mind
the
notion
of
some
corridor
with
doors
going
off
to
various
apartments.
so
you
have
only
the
two
doors,
and
the
two
doors
are
wide
open,
with
no
doors
visible
at
all.
the
doorways
are
wide
open.
and
to
and
behold,
directly
in
front
of
them,
not
in
what
turned
out
to
be
his
apartment,
not
even
in
the
bedroom
that
they
saw
on
their
right,
but
directly
in
front
of
them
is
the
respondent
garrison.
he
is
in
pajamas,
and
he
is
in
a
body
cast
because
he
had
had
recent
spinal
surgery.
he
is
asked
to
identify
himself,
and
he
does.
he
is
silent
with
respect
to,
wait
a
minute,
now,
i
am
a
neighbor
here,
this
is
not...
what
are
you
doing
here
in
my
place.
he
is
absolutely
silent
on
that
question.
he
is
detained,
and
taken
off
to
the
livingroom
thing
that
i
described
on
the
left,
and
the
police
at
this
moment
see,
as
they
are
into
this
tiny
car,
they
see
marijuana
on
the
bureau
in
the
bedroom,
what
they
think
is
marijuana
on
the
bureau
in
the
bedroom
of
garrison.
the
very
thing
they
had
the
probable
cause
to
believe
was
being
sold
by
mcwebb
from
his
apartment
they
now
see
in
a
bedroom
on
a
bureau
five,
six
feet
away
from
where
they
were.
it
is
reasonable,
it
is
reasonable,
we
suggest,
and
that
is
the
standard
and,
we
suggest,
the
only
standard
that
needs
apply
here,
for
the
police
to
have
assumed
that
garrison
was
a
housemate,
garrison
was
a
roommate,
garrison
was
a
convalescing
cousin
come
to
call.
he
was
not
a
neighbor
who
had
some
independent
living
arrangement
over
there.
now,
there
were
other
indicia
that
developed
in
the
course
of
this
episode
that
are
more
ambiguous
in
terms
of
the
timing,
but
they
cut
very
much
in
favor
of
the
state.
the
phone
in
garrison's
bedroom
on
the
right
rings.
it
is
a
phone
call
for
red
cross,
mcwebb.
clothes
are
found
hanging
on
what
was
the
exterior
door
to
garrison's
apartment,
the
one
on
the
right.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
no,
your
honor,
the
entire
apartment,
as
it
turns
out,
and
as
the
police,
as
they
did
their
securing
tour
of
the
premises
later
discovered,
but
only
after
the
heroin
was
discovered
in
the
bedroom,
the
entire
apartment,
your
honor,
would
be...
the
bedroom
of
garrison
would
be
what
is
marked
"bedroom".
the
living
room
immediately
behind
it
is
garrison's...
is
the
living
room
of
that
apartment.
you
see
a
kitchen
down
on
the
left
and
a
bathroom.
indeed,
it
was
when
the
sergeant
saw
two
kitchens
as
he
went
through
this
entire
operation
and
noticed
that
there
was
the
opportunity...
the
two
bathrooms
with
an
opportunity
to
lock
a
bolt
that
was
open
but
nonetheless
he
saw
that,
and--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
oh,
absolutely.
the
only
way
to
get
into
garrison's
apartment
was
through
the
doorway,
wide
open,
as
i
described,
that
shows
immediately
to
the
right
of
the
stairs.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
no,
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
the
two
apartments
turn
out
to
be
an
apartment
on
the
right,
garrison's,
and
an
apartment
on
the
left,
mcwebb's.
the
point
is
that
we
didn't
realize
that--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
until
the
discovery
that
i
was
attempting
to
explain
to
mr.
justice
brennan
before
the
break,
until
the
discovery
by
the
police
of
the
two
kitchens
and
the
two
bathrooms,
until
it
became
apparent
to
the
searching
party
that
this
may
well
be
two
apartments,
at
which
point
the
search
ceased,
an
assistant
state's
attorney
was
called,
and
the
search
was
terminated,
until
that
point
it
is
our
position
that
nothing
about
the
scene
contradicted
the
assumption
of
the
warrant.
everything
about
the
scene
reasonably
observable
that
came
to
the
senses
of
the
police
officers
confirmed
the
assumption
of
the
warrant,
the
central
assumption
of
this
case,
which
is
that
there
was
one
third
floor
apartment
and
it
was
mcwebb's.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
there
was--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--there
was
one
door,
mr.
justice,
that
led,
only
one
door
on
the
third
floor
that
entered
into
what
we
now
know
to
be
the
two
apartments
of
mcwebb
and
garrison.
it
was
a
locked
door,
and
it
was
through
that
door
that
mcwebb's
key
and
mcwebb
led
the
officers.
that
enters,
that
one
door,
as
opposed
to
the
second
and
first
floors,
where
there
are
many
doors,
that
one
door,
and
i
am
referring
here
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
appendix
page
44,
that
one
door
leads
to
a
very
small
foyer.
it
is
marked
hallway.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
off
which
there
are
doors,
but
at
the
moment
they
entered
all
the
police
saw,
so
the
court
found,
was
two
doorways,
not
even
doors,
two
doorways,
the
one
on
the
right
into
garrison's
bedroom,
and
what
we
know
to
be
his
apartment,
and
on
the
left
into
mcwebb's.
in
fact,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
now
know
that
the
door
on
the
right,
once
we
are
into
the
third
floor,
now,
the
door
on
the
right
was
in
fact
the
door
to
a
garrison
apartment.
the
door
on
the
left
was
a
door
into
a
mcwebb
apartment.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
well,
there
were
doorways,
and
all
that
was
visible
to
the
police
were
doorways.
in
fact,
there
were
doors
but
they
were
fully
opened
and
they
opened
inward
so
that
they
were
not
visible
to
the
searching
officers.
indeed,
mr.
justice
scalia,
the
evidence
is
that
at
some
point
during
the
presence
of
the
police
officers
in
the
garrison
bedroom
they
noticed
clothes,
they
noticed
the
door
finally,
and
there
were
clothes
hanging
on
its
exterior,
so
that...
and
the
police...
it
was
a
further
indicia,
we
suggest,
that
this
was
not
a
separate
apartment.
who
hangs
clothes
over
the
outside
door
to
one's
own
apartment?
we
don't
press
it
too
hard,
frankly,
sir,
because
it
is
a
little
ambiguous
as
to
the
precise
point
at
which
they
noticed
that
particular
feature.
we
ask
this,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
it
is
customary
for
counsel
such
as
myself
in
defense
of
searches
by
police
in
the
argument
of
reasonableness
to
invoke,
to
really
plea
for
understanding
from
courts
because
of
the
obvious
tenseness
of
the
situations,
because
of
the
danger
of
the
situations,
because
of
the
kind
of
considerations
this
court
recognized
in
michigan
against
summers
and
others,
the
split
second...
the
need
for
split
second
decisionmaking.
all
of
that
is
true
here,
and
of
course
we
urge
that
those
considerations
be
part
of
the
analysis
of
the
court,
but
we
have
so
much
more
here.
we
are
not
left
with
only
those
indulgences
that
we
ask
of
courts
for
police
conduct.
we
had
a
warrant.
these
police
had
a
warrant
that
they
believed
to
be
valid,
and
they
reasonably
believed
it
to
be
valid,
and
they
reasonably
believed
that
they
were
executing
it
valid.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--the
court
of
appeals,
with
all
respect
to
it,
from
hindsight.
that
is
how,
mr.
justice
white.
the
court
of
appeals...
nobody
can
change
what--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--what
is
striking
about
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
it
absolutely
eschews
any
analysis
of
reasonableness
whatsoever.
it
is
precisely
the
vice
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
it
encants
a
conclusion.
you
did
not
have
a
warrant
for
the
premises.
there
was
no
warrant
for
the
search
in
hill.
it
is
always
after
the
fact.
one
can
always
say,
if
one
finds
fault
one
can
say
with
respect
to
any
such
analysis
there
was
no
warrant.
the
point
here
is,
did
they
reasonably
believe
they
had
a
valid
warrant?
the
issue
in
this
case,
sir,
is
whether
or
not
the
mistake
made
by
the
police
was
reasonable.
that
is
an
analysis
the
court
of
appeals
never
made.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
then
we
should
have
lost
this
case
and
we
would
not
be
arguing
what
we
are
here
arguing.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
conclude
that
it
would
have
been
or
should
have
been
reasonable
to
anyone.
the
court
of
special...
the
trial
court
found
reasonableness.
the
court
of
special
appeals
affirmed
that
finding.
the
court
of
appeals
never
asked
the
question,
and
that's
the--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--that
was
its
intention
clearly.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
what
it
said
literally,
mr.
justice
white,
is
this,
"for
the
person
of".
there
is
a
printed
warrant
that
is
at
the
beginning...
you
will
find
it
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
4.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
it
reads,
"for
the
person
of",
and
then
the
name
mcwebb
is
there.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
and
then
it
says
"for
the
premises
known
as".
it
doesn't
say
his,
it
simply
says
"for
the
premises
known
as
2036
park
avenue,
third
floor
apartment.
"
there
is
no
question
that
the
assumption
of
the
warrant
and
of
the
officers
was
that
the
intention
was
only
to
search
mcwebb's
apartment.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
if
they
had
known
of
a
garrison
apartment,
2a----
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--the
warrant
doesn't
address
literally
that,
sir,
but
the
warrant
assumption
is,
the
affidavit
recites
the
information
received
from
the
gas
and
electric
company.
the
warrant
assumes
without
stating,
but
it
was
the
clear
assumption
of
the
warrant
that
the
entire...
that
the
mcwebb
apartment
in
question
was
the
third
floor.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
exactly
so,
and
had
they
arrived
at
the
third
floor
and
suddenly
found
two
closed
doors,
one
of
which
said
mcwebb
and
the
other
garrison,
they
should
not
have--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--absolutely.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
yes,
sir.
it
was
reasonable
to
get
the
warrant
on
that
assumption,
it
was
reasonable
to
assume
it
going
up
those
stairs.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
precisely
so.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
precisely
like
hill,
and
exactly
as
in
hill,
officers'...
the
recognition
that
officers'
mistakes
can
be
understandable.
sufficient
probability,
not
certainty,
is
the
touchstone
of
reasonableness,
as
this
court
said,
and
that
is
precisely
the
doctrine
that
we
think
needs
to
be
applied
here.
this
is
not
a
case
for
new
doctrine.
this
is
not
a
case
for
extension
of
any
present
doctrine.
this
is
not
a
case
for
newfangled...
some
would
call
it
newfangled
notions.
this
is
an
old-fashioned
traditional--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--in
this...
certainly
not
in
a
case
that
involves
an
alleged
mistake
of
fact.
it
is
the
heart
of
our
position
that
when
you
are
addressing
the
issue
of
reasonableness
or
not
of
a
factual
mistake
there
is
no
difference
whatsoever
between
the
merits
test
and
the
good
faith
test.
if
the
police
reasonably,
with
objective
reasonableness,
the
language
of
leon,
believed
here
that
there
was
one
apartment
and
only
one
and
it
was
mcwebb's,
then
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation.
we
don't
have
to
get
into
the
problem
of
the
different
voices
that
have
been
discussed
in
some
other
sense
in
leon,
in
a
dissent
in
leon,
with
respect
to
this
issue,
this
case.
other
cases
may
present
the
question
of
how
and
under
what
circumstances
the
police
can
be
said
to
be
objectively
reasonable,
notwithstanding
the
fact
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
leon
and
shepherd
do
that
very
thing.
that,
we
urge
your
honors--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--the
legal
judgment
is
a
much
tougher
situation.
where
leon
goes
from
here
with
respect
to
analyzing
the
police's
good
faith
objective
reasonableness
in
making
legal
conclusions
is
a
problem
but
not
a
problem
for
us,
we
respectfully
suggest,
in
this
case.
this
is
a
mistake
of
fact
case.
it
is
hill.
it
is
heavily
influenced
by
if
not
controlled
by
the
decision
in
hill.
room,
this
court
said
in
brinegar,
must
be
allowed
for
reasonable
mistakes
on
the
part
of
police
officers.
such
reasonable
mistake
was
made
here,
and
we
think
that
the
judgment
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
which
never
even
asked
the
question
of
reasonableness,
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
unless--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--twenty-six

mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
i
am
sorry,
2036
park
avenue.
it
is
just
below
the
reservoir,
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
is
now
known,
i
think,
as
reservoir
hill.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
just
briefly,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
warrant
was
issued
on
the
assumption
that
one
third
floor
apartment
existed
and
it
was
mcwebb's.
that
assumption
turned
out
to
be
a
mistake.
the
issue
and
the
only
issue
is
whether
that
mistake
was
a
reasonable
one
or
not.
with
respect
to
justice
o'connor's
point
with
respect
to
hill,
hill
resulted
in
the
search
of
a
premises.
it
resulted
in
the
kind
of
intrusion
that
mr.
krupp
was
concerned
about.
it
was
permitted
because
albeit
it
wasn't
a
warrant
case
but
it
was
permitted
because
the
mistake
in
the
belief
that
miller
was
hill
was
a
reasonable
one.
it
led
to,
under
the
then
existing
scope
of
law,
it
led
to
the
kind
of
search
that
we
have
here.
the
heart
of
the
matter,
and
a
per
se
test
will
not
answer
the
question.
mr.
krupp
in
effect
urges
a
per
se
test.
if
the
warrant
turns
out
to
have
been
mistaken
it
can
never
be
good.
it
is
only
a
conclusion
to
say
it
was
warrantless
or
it
was
beyond
the
scope.
the
question
that
we
must
ask
is
why
was
it,
if
you
want
to
analyze
it
as
warrantless,
warrantless,
and
why
was
it,
if
you
want
to
analyze
it
as
beyond
the
scope,
beyond
the
scope?
the
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement,
the
warrant
requirement,
warrants
are
presumptively
reasonable.
not
to
have
one
is
presumptively
unreasonable.
but
all
of
the
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
result
in
warrantless
searches
which
are
held
by
this
court
to
be
reasonable
because
exigent,
because
not
pursuit,
because
consent--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
--well,
i
read
massachusetts
against
shepherd,
mr.
justice
stevens,
as
a
defect
of
law.
this
was
a
legally...
this
was
a
legally
invalid
warrant.
this
court
has
held
that.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
well,
it
falls
in
a
sort
of
sui
generis
category
that
some
could
call
a
technical
error.
i
don't
think
it
is
our
burden
to
have
to
define
whether
it
was
or
was
not
a
technical
error,
but
it
is
very
distinguishable
from
this
case.
it
was
not
a
mistake
in
the
assumptions
and
facts
that
led
to
the
signing
and
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
it
was
a
ministerial
mistake,
perhaps,
in
the
putting
together
of
the
papers
for
the
warrant
for
which
the
police
have
been
held
by
this
court
not
to
be
responsible.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
in
your
hypothetical,
mr.
justice,
that
you
have
described
sufficient
probable
cause
to
enter
two
different...
two
persons'
places
just
because
one
of
them...
this
is
the
lady
and
the
tiger...
just
because
one
of
them
is
likely
to
be
dealing
drugs.
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
is
bottomed
on
the
assumption,
reasonable,
we
say,
that
only
mcwebb
lived
on
that
floor
and
there
was
only
one
apartment
on
that
floor.
if
we
are
wrong
about
that,
if
that
was
unreasonable,
then
the
court
of
appeals
was
right,
but
for
the
wrong
reasons,
because
it
never
asked
the
question,
nor
did
it
analyze
it.
in
asking
ourselves
this
question,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
we
posited
the
halloween
prank.
suppose
that
the
numbers
on
all
the
doors
in
the
20
hundred
block
of
park
avenue
were
changed,
reasonably,
looking
good,
so
that
an
objective
observer
couldn't
tell
the
difference,
and
the
police
simply
went
to
the
wrong
house
and
found
heroin.
that
is
a
terrible
intrusion
on
the
innocent
victims...
not
so
innocent
in
terms
of
heroin,
but
innocent
in
terms
of
any
probable
cause
of
that
search,
and
we
come
to
the
conclusion,
and
i
hope
by
using
this
hypothetical
i
make
the
right
assumption
about
what
this
court
would
do,
there
is
nothing
the
police
did
wrong.
there
is
nothing
unreasonable
about
their
conduct.
that
is
hill,
and
that
is
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
