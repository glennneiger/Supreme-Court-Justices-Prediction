justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
judicial
finding
that
the
warrant
covered
only
mcwebb's
apartment?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
know
it
covered
only
mcwebb's
apartment?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
they
thought
if
they
could
tell,
maybe
the
officer
should
have
told.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
that
it
would
have
been
perfectly
clear
to
anybody
that
there
were
two
apartments
on
the
third
floor.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
warrant
actually
authorized
a
search
of
the
premises
of
mcwebb,
didn't
it,
at
2036
park
avenue,
third
floor
apartment?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
it
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
warrant
tell
you
that
you
are
entitled
to
search...
that
the
assumption
is
that
mcwebb
lives
on
the
whole
third
floor?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
obviously
if
they
had
arrived
at
the
third
floor
and
there
actually
was
only
one
apartment,
you
could
have
searched
the
whole
apartment.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
should
have
found
out
which
one
to
search.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
arrived
and
you
think
it
is
just
like
there
was
only
one
apartment
because
it
was
reasonable
to
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
just
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
to
get
any
farther.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
hill.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
making
a
mistake
that
these
facts
add
up
to
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
maryland
courts
read
the
warrant
as
authorizing
only
the
search
of
mcwebb's
apartment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
warrant
authorized
only
the
search
of
mcwebb's
apartment.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
they
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
second
time
you
have
said
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
if
in
the
process
of
just
walking
around
for
this
security
check
they
see
contraband--
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
they
were
rightfully
in
garrison's
apartment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
they
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
garrison's
apartment
was
all
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
it
was
all
right
to
enter
garrison's
apartment
on
your
fallback
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what
about
your
fallback
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
they
find--
justice
byron
r.
white
--after
walking
around
as
you
say
they
could
on
your
fallback
argument,
if
they
see
a
gun
lying
on
the
table
they
can't
seize
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
say
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
let's
get
something
else
that
is
contraband.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
you
don't
know
really...
you
can't
smell
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
it's
got
a
sign
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
bag
says
"plain
view
heroin".
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
unless
you
are
a
police
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
then,
while
you
are
at
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--on
your
fallback
argument,
let's
assume
that
it
was
proper
to
enter
garrison's
apartment.
at
that
point
they
saw
marijuana.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
what
the
evidence
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
they
went
ahead
and
that
officer
continued
to
search
and
found
some
other
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
assume
all
he
did
was
seize
the
marijuana.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
general,
could
i--
justice
byron
r.
white
--suppose
it
was
perfectly
clear
there
were
two
apartments
on
the
third
floor
and
everybody
knew
it
at
the
time
the
warrant
was
issued,
but
all
you
knew
was
that
drugs
were
being
sold
out
of
the
third
floor,
and
everybody
concedes
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
drugs
were
being
sold
out
of
the
third
floor,
but
they
didn't
know
which
apartment,
and
the
warrant
then
authorized
the
search
of
both
apartments.
