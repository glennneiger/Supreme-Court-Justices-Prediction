mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
mr.
chief
justice,
and
honorable
justices
of
the
court,
good
afternoon.
this
case,
and
this
court
has
struggled
for
over
70
years
in
a
very
deep,
dramatic,
and
using
legal
minds
throughout
these
years
to
try
and
balance
what
we
are
trying
to
do
today.
on
the
one
side
we
want
that
fourth
amendment
where
it
says
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
to
still
be
viable,
but
on
the
other
hand
we
do
not
want
to
handcuff
the
police
to
such
an
extent
that
it
is
going
to
frustrate
them
and
deter
them
the
opposite
way
from
going
ahead
and
trying
to
ferret
out
criminals
and
be
brought
to
justice
by
using
evidence
that
is
recovered
against
them.
now,
in
this
great
back
and
forth
stress
ever
since
weeks
to
the
present
time,
many
positions
have
been
taken.
as
a
defense
lawyer
my
heyday
was
back
in
the
warren
court.
today
i
find
it
a
much
more
difficult
uphill
battle
the
way
the
court
is
leaning,
but
that
is
fine.
we
have
to
adjust.
but
the
court
is
still
desperately
trying
to
strike
this
balance,
and
i
think
if
you
step
back
from
what
the
court
has
done,
i
think
the
court
very
clearly
during
its
period
of
time
over
this
70
some
years
has
said
that
warrantless
searches,
and
you
still
say
warrantless
searches
are
per
se
unreasonable.
the
touchstone
of
the
fourth
amendment
indeed
is
reasonable
because
the
fourth
amendment
says
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
so
the
question
is,
is
this
an
unreasonable
search,
and
we
submit
without
any
equivocation
it
is,
because
it
was
indeed
a
warrantless
search.
to
say
that
they
had
a
warrant
for
garrison's
apartment
would
be
just
picking
themselves
up
by
its
own
bootstraps.
if,
for
instance,
the
police
would
have
gone
with
a
warrant
into
the
wrong
place
first
and
then
they
discovered
it,
went
into
the
right
place,
nobody
would
have
a
problem
with
that
because
the
warrant
indeed
was
for
mcwebb.
if
the
police
didn't
really
know
where
to
go,
and
there
was,
say,
only
one
apartment,
and
nothing
was
seized
from
garrison
because
it
said
mcwebb,
and
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
the
affidavit
clearly
says
mcwebb
and
third
floor.
an
inference
is
there,
what
is
the
inference?
the
person
to
be
seized
is
that
person
who
lives
at
that
apartment
on
the
third
floor.
so
this
indeed
was
a
warrantless
search.
sure,
they
had
a
warrant.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
certainly.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
they
searched
within
the
area
described
in
the
warrant,
but
they
also,
as
general
sachs
pointed
out,
there
is
a
place
on
the
warrant.
indeed,
the
affidavit,
which
we
can
incorporate
by
reference,
mentions
mcwebb,
mcwebb,
mcwebb.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
no,
it
does
not.
if
it
said
that--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
what
they
were
looking
for
truly,
we
know
for
a
fact,
was
mcwebb's
premises,
not
garrison's
or
not
anybody
else's.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
do
you
know
what
the
maryland
courts,
justice
white--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
yes.
yes,
they
did.
the
answer
is
yes,
and
what
they
did,
that's
correct,
what
they
did,
without
any
equivocation
stated
is
what
i
just
started
with.
warrantless
searches
are
per
se
unreasonable.
there
was
no
warrant.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that's
correct.
they
felt--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--very
similarly
to
what
i
am
arguing
to
the
court
today,
that
because
mcwebb
is
mentioned,
and
the
affidavit,
we
can't
forget
that.
that
is
the
guts
of
why
you
get
the
warrant.
it
talks
about
mcwebb.
it
describes
him.
the
police
knew
who
he
was
to
such
an
extent
when
he
walked
up,
they
knew
right
away
who
he
was.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that's
correct.
it
says...
the
facts
presented
by
general
sachs
to
you
are
absolutely
correct.
that
is
the
finding.
it
describes
a
third
floor
apartment.
what
was
wrong
when
judge
landon
signed
the
warrant
and
what
was
wrong
when
they
finally
got
to
the
third
floor,
there
turned
out
to
be
two
separate,
distinct
apartments,
one
belonging
to
harold
garrison,
which
he
has
an
absolute
unequivocal
right
against
trespassing
by
police
officers
who
are
walking
into
his
premises
without
a
warrant.
that
was
not
the
intention
or
the
contemplation
of
the
judge
nor
was
it
the
contemplation
or
the
intention
of
the
police
officers
when
they
entered
the
premises.
they
didn't
go
in
looking
for
garrison.
they
were
looking
for
mr.
mcwebb,
and
they
had
him,
he
led
them
upstairs,
and
lo
and
behold,
there
they
are.
i
am
not
going
to
argue
to
this
court
certainly
as
if
it
were
a
jury,
but
our
court
of
appeals
when
i
argued
the
case
couldn't
understand
why
the
police,
who
can
see
around
corners
and
see
into
bags
that
are
opaque,
couldn't
see
the
numbers
on
the
doors.
they
found
trouble
with
that.
they
looked
at
this
case
as
a
self-serving,
as
a
bootstrap
case
for
the
police
to
get
themselves
into
a
premises
and
to
make
a
warrant
sustain
itself
where
it
didn't
belong.
we
are
not
deterring
the
police
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that
is
just
what
i
was
getting
to,
justice
brennan.
yes,
he
was.
he
was
convicted.
why?
because
our
officer
who
represented
him
pled
him
guilty.
the
warrant
was
good.
the
search
was
good.
but
of
his
apartment.
and
he...
that
is
exactly
my
point.
we
are
not
deterring
the
police
from
frustration.
we
are
not
having
them
being
frustrated,
because
mcwebb,
the
target
was
brought
to
justice,
pled
guilty,
was
convicted,
and
met
the
full
justice
of
the
court
below.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
the
simple
answer,
i
think--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--yes.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
because
the
court
never
has.
the
court
has
never
elevated
the
citizen
on
the
street--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--well,
yes,
because
if
you
elevate
the
citizen
on
the
street
being
arrested
to
the
premises,
which
you
never
have,
nor
have
you
done
it
with
a
vehicle
or
a
motor
home,
which
chief
justice
burger
struggled
to
make
a
distinction
between
that
mobile
home
and
a
vehicle,
why
struggle?
the
distinction
is
this,
to
answer
you
directly.
where
will
it
lead?
the
police
officer
stops
the
policeman,
the
suspect
on
the
street.
he
makes
a
mistake.
pursuant
to
that,
under
the
common
law
and
chimel
versus
california,
he
searches.
we
say
you
cannot
stop
and
frisk
a
house.
is
that
where
it
is
going
to
lead,
in
other
words?
we
talk
about
probable
cause
and
the
fourth
amendment,
and
now
we
are
diminished
down
to
articulable,
reasonable
suspicion,
which--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--i
think
with
the
individual,
without
question,
to
answer
you,
yes,
because
this
court
has
seen
fit
that
the
individual
does
not
have
that
same
degree
of
protection
under
the
fourth
amendment
nor
does
a
car,
nor
does
anything
traveling
out
on
the
street,
including
that
mobile
home
again.
so,
without
any
question
if
you
elevate
it
to
the
premises
you
are
taking
away
the
very
place
where
the
human
being...
everybody
can
find
sanctity.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
this
court
has.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
why?
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
happen
to
disagree
with
the
hill
decision.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
think
you
should
not.
i
think
the
individual
on
the
street
should
be
secure
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
the
same
as
my
premise.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
was
it
wrong?
in
my
opinion,
yes.
but
the
difference
in
hill,
let--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--let
me
go
back
to
hill
for
a
minute
to
show
you
why.
what
happened
in
hill,
if
you
recall,
is
that
when
they
arrested
hill
and
made
the
subsequent
search
it
wasn't
of
his
person,
it
was
way
beyond
his
reach,
lunge,
or
grasp,
which
would
now
violate
chimel
versus
california,
so
the
whole
crux
of
hill
would
not
even
be
viable
today
because
hill
really
didn't
care
about
being
arrested.
he
cared
about
the
evidence
that
was
used
against
him,
and
that
evidence
was
out
of
his
reach,
lunge,
or
grasp,
and
under
chimel
versus
california
this
court
would
say
nice
try
but
you
went
too
far.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
no.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
no,
i
don't.
i
think
the
fourth
amendment--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--i
think
the
fourth
amendment
says
what
it
says.
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
in
their
houses,
in
their
papers,
and
their
effects.
the
court
has
made
the
distinction.
i
live
by
it.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
there
is
a
big
distinction--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--in
that,
too,
justice
scalia.
let
me
say
why.
when
you
go
to
get
a
warrant
from
a
detached,
neutral
magistrate,
a
policeman
is
doing
precisely
what
this
court
for
70
some
years
has
begged
him
to
do
and
urged
him
to
do.
he
went
to
that
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
and
when
he
went
there
he
gave
the
magistrate
with
his
knowledge
the
opportunity
to
act
as
a
buffer
between
the
overzealous
police
that
defense
would
always
argue
and
the
citizen's
rights.
so
we
have
that
protection.
justice
o'connor
touched
on
that
very
thing
in
the
first
case
today
of
krull.
in
a
statute,
for
instance,
in
krull
we
have
at
least,
at
least
the
legislature
intervening,
using
their
knowledge
and
wisdom
to
give
guidance
to
a
policeman.
at
least
we
have
that,
but
in
this
case
we
have
the
unbridled,
sole
judgment
of
a
police
officer
trying
to
do
his
job
in
good
faith.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
so
far,
so
good.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
mcwebb,
incidentally,
was
named
in
the
warrant.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
yes.
absolutely,
yes.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
yes.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
yes.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
went
wrong
the
moment
he
walked
in
through
that
threshold
of
that
house
that
this
court
has
always
held
above
everything
else.
the
moment
he
walked
through
the
threshold.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
didn't
know.
were
we
to
reward
him
for
his
mistake?
he
didn't
even
have
probable
cause,
and
that
is...
the
constitution
says
probable
cause.
now
when
he
walks
in
with
a
blunder
we
are
saying
we
are
going
to
reward
a
blunder?
if
the
surgeon
cuts
off
the
wrong
arm
we
don't
reward
him.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
the
blunder
of
the
magistrate.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
there's
a
difference,
because
you
have
that
neutral--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--i
am
sorry,
sir?
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
no,
not
in
this
case.
no.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
in
this
case,
the
error--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--even
though
in
good
faith,
was
the
police.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
absolutely,
because
mcwebb
by
inference,
by
the
affidavit,
we
can't
disregard
the
affidavit
or
the
fact
that
it
mentioned
mcwebb.
we
are
talking
about
a
man's
house.
we
are
not
talking
about
his
car,
which
is
subject
to
license
and
regulation.
we
are
not
talking
about
walking
on
the
street.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
no,
that's
mcwebb.
mcwebb
did
not
give
the
key
to
garrison's
apartment.
garrison's
apartment
was
open
to
the
police
because
his
door
was
open.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
did
garrison
ever
accept
the
key?
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
believe
it
was
clear
that...
not
on
the
record,
but
i
think
it
is
very
clear
without
any
equivocation
that
they
were
two
separate,
absolutely
distinct
apartments.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
with
the
same
common
door.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
most
respectfully,
your
honor--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--let
me
say
this
to
answer
that.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
correct.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
also
on
the
first
floor,
all
seven
apartments
had
the
same
door
with
the
same
lock
and
the
same
key.
by
your
analysis,
most
respectfully,
we
cannot
draw
an
inference
that
they
could
walk
into
all
seven.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that
is
true.
i
am
not
arguing
the
facts.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
police
didn't
act
reasonably.
i
think
they
did,
as
far
as
what
was
in
front
of
them.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
well,
no.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
absolutely.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--no,
because
we
want
to
look
out
to
the
future
to
protect
the
other
people.
sure,
one
murderer
may
go
free.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
don't
think
the
police
did
all
they
could
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
am
saying
assuming
arguendo
it
was,
i
still
believe
without
any
equivocation--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--i
am
protecting
you
when
you
go
into
your
chambers
so
when
the
police
walk
in
for
a
warrant
for
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
don't
bungle
into
yours
by
mistake.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
not
if
we
set
up
new
guidelines.
for
instance,
let
me
address
that.
in
a
multiple
dwelling
unit
where
we
have
approximately,
i
would
think,
60
to
70
million
people
that
we
are
talking
about,
and
these
people
live
that
way
in
multiple
dwelling
units.
they
leave
the
doors
open.
it
is
convenient.
it
is
secure,
very
often,
unlike
mr.
sachs,
perhaps,
they
drape
their
clothes
over
their
doors.
they
do
many
things
that
you
wouldn't
do
in
your
castle.
now,
when
the
police
come
into
a
multiple
dwelling
unit,
especially
that
unit,
now,
let's
look
at--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--no,
no.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
yes,
they
did.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
there
were
seven
mailboxes
and
seven
bells
outside.
that
triggered
it
off.
here
is
what
i
am
saying,
that
this
multiple
dwelling
unit,
unlike
one
of
the
fine
units
you
find
in
washington,
where
you
have
guards,
and
each
unit
is
separate,
this
is
an
old
home.
this
is
a
home
that
used
to
be
the
residence
of
one
person.
so
therefore
it
doesn't
have
the
same
integrity
or
outward
appearance
as
the
wonderful
new
condominiums
would.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
am
arguing...
i
am
arguing
obviously
two
ways.
first,
i
am
arguing
that
i
feel
that
the
search
was
per
se
unreasonable
because
there
was
no
warrant.
if
the
court
feels
that
i
am
off-base
on
there
then
i
retract,
take
one
step
back,
and
say
i
don't
think
the
search
itself
or...
not
the
search
itself
but
the
actions
of
the
police
were
reasonable.
a
solution
when
they
walk
into
a
multiple
dwelling
unit,
especially
ones
in
our
cities
that
are
absolutely
inundated
with
multiple
units,
indeed,
some
of
them
probably
within
themselves
have
rooms
where
borders
are
rooming,
the
first
thing
they
should
do,
and
i
don't
think
this
is
unreasonable,
is
to
walk
in,
come
up
to
this
third
floor,
and
instead
of
scanning
out
and
searching
and
seizing,
the
first
thing
they
do
is
detain
garrison
and
detain
mcwebb.
michigan
versus
summers
says
they
can.
fine.
let's
do
that.
then
fan
out,
walk
through
the
apartments
to
see
precisely
where
they
are,
also
for
their
own
protection.
walk
through
to
make
sure
there
is
no
one
else
hidden
that
is
going
to
kill
them.
walk
through
to
make
sure
there
isn't
contraband
being
destroyed.
so
it
serves
a
dual
purpose,
and
when
they
walk
through,
and
before
they
search,
and
before
they
seize,
they
see
the
two
kitchens,
they
see
the
bathrooms,
and
that
triggers,
we've
got
the
wrong
place.
they
stop
there,
before
they
search
and
seize.
then
they
inquire.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire.
i
am
saying
that
they
have
a
right
to
walk
in
and
they
have
a
right
to
neutralize
the
premises
and
something
is
in
plain
view
and
it
was
stumbled
upon,
as
this--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--no.
first
i
argued
no--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--no,
i
said
if
i
have
to
retract
that.
i
say
as
soon
as
they
went
through
his
threshold
without
probable
cause
for
his
apartment--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--they
violate
it.
if
you
feel
i
am
wrong
i
step
back
and
say
the
entry
into--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--in
what
regard,
sir?
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
no,
i
do
not.
i
say
it
is
per
se
unreasonable
because
they
didn't
have
a
warrant
for
his
apartment.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
fallback,
i
say
if
we
allow
them
to
walk
in
we
have
to
put
some
guidelines
on
them,
some
bridles.
we
can't
let
them
just
run
around
a
multiple
unit
searching
and
seizing
and
arresting.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
in
open
view.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
no.
a
gun
i
don't
think
is
contraband.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
say
they
cannot
seize
it
because
it
is
not
contraband
under
article
2736(b)
of
our
maryland
law,
for
instance.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
let's
get
something
that
is
obvious,
heroin.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
well,
it
is
marked
heroin
and
it
looks
euphoric.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
mean,
i
am
trying
to
say,
yes,
if
they
truly--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--right,
that's
it.
0
[generallaughter.]
that's
it.
that's
precisely
what
i
was
getting
to,
but...
then
they
can
pick
it
up
under
coolidge
versus--
--and
seize
it.
and
seize
it,
but
stop
the
search.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
now
go
back
to
a
magistrate,
where
you
have
always
urged
the
police
to
do,
get
that
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
and
say,
look
what
happened
to
us.
while
fanning
out
in
this
multiple
unit
we
discovered
heroin
marked
"heroin,
do
not
touch
unless
you
are
an
addict.
"
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
we
picked
it
up.
here
it
is.
we
want
a
warrant
to
search
the
rest.
why
is
that
not
the
reasonable
way
to
handle
it?
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
they
secure
it.
there
were
six
people
on
the
team,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
they
can
secure
that
place.
they
can
secure
it.
they
can
take
garrison
and
mcwebb
away,
detain
them
all
they
want.
remember,
criminals
don't--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
well,
they
can
detain
him.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
because
you
said
so
in
your
case
of
michigan
versus
summers.
you
said
it
is
reasonable
when
you
walk
in
and
have
probable
cause.
when
you
don't
determine
who
mr.
garrison
is
in
his
cast,
you
can
stop
and
detain
him
while
you
then
go
around
searching
while
you
have
probable
cause.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
there
is
not.
i
am
taking
my
one
step
back.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
excuse
me.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that's
correct,
and
i
stand
by
that
as
my
first
proposition.
if
this
court
feels
there
was
probable
cause
because
they
relied
in
good
faith
objectively
on
a
warrant
and
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
it
was
not
the
correct
mcwebb
apartment,
then
they
walked
in.
so
i
am
saying
at
that
point
they
had
a
right
to
walk
through
the
threshold.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
there
is
not.
he
is
not
arrested,
he
is
detained.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
they
have
a
warrant,
which
this
court
feels,
many
of
the
members,
that
that
should
give
the
police
the
right
to
search.
certainly
if
they
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
privacy
of
the
search
itself
they
should
have
at
least
a
right
to
detain.
that
is
an
infringement
on
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
it
is.
yes,
it
is.
i
agree
with
that.
it
is
very
contrary
to
the
rest
of
the
argument.
i
am
trying
to
find
two
positions.
the
position
i
am
trying
to
drive
home
to
this
court,
we
talk
about
the
good
faith
reliance
in
leon.
to
me
that...
as
a
defense
lawyer
i
wasn't
ecstatic
with
it,
but
it
is
reasonable.
it
is
logical.
it
makes
sense,
because,
as
i
said,
for
70
years
we
have
been
urging
the
police
to
go
to
that
neutral
detached
magistrate,
seek
him
out.
if
he
makes
a
mistake,
if
he
doesn't
apply
the
old
ad
valorem
spinelli
two-pronged
test,
that
is
not
the
policeman's
fault.
the
policeman,
armed,
in
good
faith,
believing
he
has
the
right,
comes
in,
so
that
makes
sense
to
me.
that,
i
believe,
is
reasonable.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
do
not
hold
that
okay.
i
still
say
if
it...
i
am
sorry.
if
the
police...
it
is
the
correct
apartment.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
yes,
because--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--well,
you
have
already
touched
on
that,
i
believe,
in
the
case
of
franks
versus
delaware.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that's
okay.
and
i
can
live
with
that.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
don't
think
it
is
anywhere
near
the
same,
your
honor,
most
respectfully.
that
informant
said
go
here,
you
will
find
x,
y,
and
z.
they
went
to
that
location
where
the
magistrate
said,
you
go
there.
he
did
go
there.
but
in
our
case--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--oh,
you
did,
you
have.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
that's
correct.
i
know
of
no
case
that
allows
that.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
no,
franks
versus
delaware
did
not...
franks
versus
delaware
allowed
you
to
go
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
warrant
to
show
that
the
police
willfully
and
wantonly
presented
facts
into
the
warrant.
if
the
informant
gives
information
that
is
totally,
totally
unreliable
and
not
true
but
the
policeman
in
good
faith
believes
that,
you
have
sustained
the
warrant,
i
think,
but
remember,
it
goes
to
the
special
place.
see,
we
are
talking
about
the
particularity
clause.
remember,
if
we
continue
with
the
fourth
amendment
wording
it
particularly
describes
the
place
to
be
searched
or
the
person
or
property
to
be
seized.
he
went
beyond
that.
even,
if
i
recall,
justice
white
in
his
leon
opinion
gave
a
caveat.
he
said--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--well,
in
the
opinion
that
you
wrote,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
caveat
was
that
the
particularity
clause
still
must
be
served.
you
still,
mr.
constable,
must
go
to
the
right
place
and
seize
the
right
person
and
the
right
things
that
i
say
you
can,
and
in
this
case
they
did
not
do
that.
so,
if
it
please
the
court,
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
thank
the
court
for
the
opportunity
to
present.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
yes.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
no.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
i
think
the
argument...
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
affidavit.
if
the
affidavit
is
signed--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--pardon
me?
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
well,
the
affidavit
mentions
mcwebb,
mcwebb,
mcwebb.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
now,
if
the
affidavit
was
totally
silent
and
they
didn't
know
who
they
were
looking
for,
i
think
there
is
a
much
stronger
argument
for
this
good
faith
or
objective
reasonableness.
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that
would
make
a
difference,
and
maybe
one
day
i
will
be
back
to
argue
that.
if
i
may,
in
light
of
the
question,
i
still
have
time...
i
don't
want
to
belabor
this--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--yes,
sir.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
well,
again--
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
but
that
marijuana
does
not
give
him
the
right
to
search.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
yes.
that's
correct.
on
my
fallback
argument
mr.
garrison
could
be
convicted
of
marijuana.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
as
it
was
he
was
found
guilty
of
the
heroin
found
in
his
dresser
drawer.
mr.
gerald
a.
kroop
he
shouldn't
have
had
it.
he
wasn't
obeying
the
law.
but
the
officer
shouldn't
have
been
there
to
find
it.
thank
you,
your
honors.
