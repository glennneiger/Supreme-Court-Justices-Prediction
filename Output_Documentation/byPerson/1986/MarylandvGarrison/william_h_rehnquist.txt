general

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william

unlike
the
appearances
on
the

and
second
floors.

general
sachs,
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
we
will
resume
argument
where
we
left
off,
general
sachs.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
sachs.
we
will
hear
next
from
you,
mr.
kroop.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
supposed
to
have
been
happening
to
the
place
while
they
went
back
to
the
magistrate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
your
position
is
that
the
warrant
simply
didn't
cover
garrison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
are
right,
why
can
they
take
garrison
away?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
was
the
probable...
but
i
thought
under
your
analysis
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
search--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--will
you
wait
until
i
finish
my
question,
please,
and
slow
down
just
a
little?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
under
your
analysis
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
entering
garrison's
apartment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
where
is
the
probable
cause
to
arrest
garrison?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
level
at
which
they
have
to
have
to
detain
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
on
this
point
is
quite
contrary
to
your
argument
on
the
rest
of
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kroop.
general
sachs,
do
you
have
any
more?
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
sachs.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no
85-759,
maryland
against
