justice
john
paul
stevens
general
sachs,
you
argue
in
the
alternative,
as
i
read
your
brief,
that
this
is
a
reasonable
search
and
therefore
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
b,
this
is
a
reasonable
search
and
therefore...
and
you
are
entitled
to
the
good
faith
exception.
in
your
view
is
there
a
difference
in
the
test
of
reasonableness
under
the
two
different
arguments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
for
a
second,
mr.
kroop?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
read
the
warrant,
which
i
think,
incidentally,
is
on
page
9,
not
page
4
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
premises,
a
description
of
the
premises,
the
premises
known
as
2036
park
avenue,
third
floor
apartment,
described
as
a
three-story
building
with
the
numerals
2036.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
they
did
search
within
the
area
described
in
the
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
doesn't
say
the
premises--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
doesn't
identify,
associate
the
premises
with
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
also
describes
the
premises
the
same
way
the
warrant
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
one
more
if
i
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
warrant
would
be
valid
if
it
had
left
out
the
reference
to
mcwebb?
what
it
says
is,
he
has
reason
to
believe--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
the
person
of
mcwebb
there
is,
and
so
forth,
and
that
on
the
premises
known
as,
and
so
forth.
if
you
left
out
all
the
references
to
the
individual
which
merely
describe
the
premises
the
way
the
premises
are
described,
would
you
then
make
the
same
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
thing
in
the
affidavit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
affidavit
is
written
the
same
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
sachs,
with
respect
to
your
first
argument,
not
the
good
faith
one,
is
your
argument,
do
you
think,
entirely
consistent
with
massachusetts
against
shepherd?
wasn't
the
same
sort
of
defect
in
the
warrant
there
just
kind
of
somebody
bungled
a
little
bit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
for
the
same
sort
of
reason
that
you
have
here,
there
was
a
kind
of
a
mechanical
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
fourth
amendment
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
maryland.
baltimore
police
officers
obtained
and
executed
a
warrant
to
search
the
person
of
one
mcwebb
and
"the
premises
known
as
2036
park
avenue,
third
floor
apartment".
at
the
time
they
obtained
the
warrant
and
at
the
time
they
started
the
search
they
thought
there
was
just
one
apartment
on
the
third
floor
of
this
multi
unit
dwelling,
but
when
they
get
on
the
scene
and
when
the
search
was
in
progress
they
realized
that
there
were
two
apartments
there.
the
contraband
that
they
seize
and
pursuant
to
the
warrant
was
in
the
respondent's
apartment
rather
than
in
mcwebb's
apartment.
and
the
question
is
whether
that
search
and
the
seizure
were
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment.
we
hold
that
judging
the
validity
of
the
warrant
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
existed
at
the
time
the
officers
applied
for
the
warrant,
and
the
validity
of
the
search
at
the
time
it
was
begun
and
at
the
time
they
found
the
material
that
the
actions
of
the
officers
was
objectively
reasonable
and
therefore
there
was
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
accordingly
we
reverse
the
contrary
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall
have
joined.
