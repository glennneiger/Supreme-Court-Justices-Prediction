we
are
protecting
the
premises
more
than
the
individual?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is
a
good
thing.
you
are
not
saying
it
is
funny
we
have
done
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
we
should
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
hill
was
wrong,
basically.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
the
only
reason
you
think
it
is
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
what
i
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
the
arrest
shouldn't
have
been
allowed,
too?
justice

from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
that
you
can
wrongfully
issue
a
warrant
because
you
think
that
the
warrant
is
proper
and
in
fact
it
is
not
proper.
nonetheless--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
a
difference?

if
they
were
closed,
and
for
all
we
know
lockable.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kroop,
it
is
no
big
deal
in
this
case.
i
mean,
we
are
just
talking
about
a
little
bit
of
marijuana,
right,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
argument
would
be
the
same
had
they
found...
had
they
found
in
walking
into
the
wrong
apartment,
which
they
thought
was
the
right
one,
they
are
behaving
properly,
and
they
find
a
murderer
there,
the
same
thing
would
be
the
case.
you
have
to
let
the
fellow
go.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
to
reward
them
for
their
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
you
have
to
turn
the
murderer
loose.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
otherwise
you
would
be
rewarding
them
for
their
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
not
protecting
anybody.
these
people
are
doing
all
that
they
possibly
could.
what
are
you
protecting
them
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now
you
are
arguing
whether
it
was
reasonable
or
not,
but
we
are
assuming
it
was
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
are
you
protecting
then?
they
are
going
to
make
the
same
mistake
in
the
future.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
going
to
make
the
same
mistake
because
it
was
reasonable.
anybody
would
have
made
that
mistake.
it
looked
like
one
apartment,
so
how
are
you
protecting
me
in
the
future?
they
are
going
to
make
exactly
the
same
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
buzzer
goes
off
and
says
i
am
a
multiple
dwelling
unit.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
know
it
was
a
multiple
dwelling
unit.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
did
they
know
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
arguing
it
was
not
a
reasonable
mistake
then.
i
mean
if
you
want
to
argue
that,
that
is
fine.
that
is
a
merits
argument
that
this
was
not
a
reasonable--
