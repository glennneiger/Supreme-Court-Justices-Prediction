mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
briefly
to
address
some
questions
that
were
raised
from
the
bench
before
proceeding
with
my
argument.
with
respect
to
whether
penalties
are
mandatory
under
the
act,
we
have
addressed
that
briefly
in
footnote
23
of
our
brief,
justice
scalia,
on
page
29.
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
penalties
are
invariably
mandatory
although
some
government
counsel
have
made
that
argument
in
the
past.
it's
only
in
preparing
this
brief
that
we
focused
on
that
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
what
has
been
held
and
that
is
the
xxx.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
addressing
it
right
now.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and,
i've
said
that
we
don't
say
that
it
has
to
be
assessed
in
every
case.
the
discretion
we
rely
on
is
not
the
discretion
of
whether
or
not
to
assess
a
penalty.
it's
the
fact
that
the
penalty
under
the
act
is
not
for
a
fixed
sum
or
a
readily
ascertainable
sum,
but
it's
a
penalty
to
be
arrived
at
through
the
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
judge.
that
is
the
discretion
on
which
we
rely.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
under
this
statute
the
government
doesn't
undertake
to
clean
up.
it
may
through
collateral
proceedings.
i
don't
say
that
it's
unfettered
discretion,
justice
white,
but
i
do--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
has
relation
to
various
factors
which
i
plan
to
discuss
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
but
there
still
is
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
that
is
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
that
is
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
a
factor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
penalties
have
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--deterrent
component.
they're
intertwined
with
the
other
remedies
which
are
injunctive
and
restorative.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
for
the
particular
violations
we
specified
that
those
penalties
were
available.
we
asked
for
penalties.
but
the
remedy--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
the
statutory
maximum
which
is
what
was
referred
to
for
purposes
of
the
complaint.
when
the
plan
was
submitted
during
the
course
of
the
trial
in
proposing
a
remedy,
we've
summarized
the
plan
briefly
in
footnote
31
of
our
brief
on
page
38.
the
plan,
the
main
features
of
the
plan
were
to
provide
for
restoration
and
mitigation
through
the
converting
of
other
properties
to
wetlands
when
some
of
those
that
had
been
unlawfully
filled
could
not
be
converted
because
of
the
need
to
protect
innocent
third
parties,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
also
asked
for
civil
penalties
and
the
penalties
that
were
provided
in
all
instances
except
with
respect
to
the
filling
in
of
a
navigable
canal,
fowling
gut
extension,
they
were
calculated
on
the
basis
of
disgorgement
of
the
net
profit.
i'm
not
talking
about
what
was
asked
for,
but
i'm
talking
about
what
the
judge
actually
ordered.
on
page
60
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
we
have
the
rationale
used
by
the
judge
in
deciding
on
various
components
of
the
penalty
and
in
the
very
first
full
paragraph
on
page
60
(a)
the
judge
said
that
he
realized
approximately
$5,000
net
profit
per
lot
with
respect
to
the
lots
that
the
court
was
then
considering
and
thus
for
the
filling
of
wetlands
lots
120,
121,
etcetera,
there
were
seven
of
them
if
you
count
those
numbers,
the
court
is
assessing
a
penalty
of
seven
times
$5,000,
or
$35,000.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
was
required
to
take
that
factor
into
account.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
isn't
limited
to
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
could
have
done
that.
xxx--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's
not
limited
to
disgorgement.
it's
a
discretionary
remedy
but
it's
intertwined--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we're
looking
for
historical
analogues
to
the
modern
statutory
action.
there
was
no
precise
action,
there
was
no
clean
water
act
at
common
law
and
no
precise
action
such
as
we
have
here.
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
and
i
was--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well
it
is
a
component
part
of
what
is
supposed
to
be
considered
with
respect
to
the
penalty
remedies
which
are
a
part
of
the
remedies
that
may
be
imposed
under
the
action.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not.
that
portion
of
the
penalty
order,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
in
the
alternative.
if
he
has
the
choice
of
restoring
this
navigable
canal
or
paying
$250,000.
since
he
filled
in
lots
and
has
sold
them
on
this
waterway,
in
order
to
restore
the
navigable
canal
he
would
have
to
re-purchase
those
lots
so
that
the
penalty,
which
is
not,
incidentally,
anything
that
we
asked
for
in
the
case,
the
penalty
serves
in
effect
as
a
cap
on
the
expense
that
he
would
be
required
to
go
to,
to
repurchase
those
lots.
i
mean,
since
the
court
could
not
order
the
new
owners
to
sell
the
lots,
if
the
court
simply
ordered
him
to
restore
the
canal
regardless
of
the
costs,
the
new
owners
would
be
in
a
position
to
charge
him
as
much
as
they
could
possibly
get
for
them.
as
it
is
this
serves
as
a
cap
on
what
he
will
have
to
pay
for
the
lots
plus
the
work
of
restoring
the
canal.
and
if
it
comes
to
the
point
where
it
exceeds
$250,000
he
will
have
the
choice
of
paying
the
$250,000.
this
kind
of
equitable
adjustment
of
the
remedy
to
the
needs
of
the
case
is
part
of
the
reason
why--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
that
case
he
had
the
alternative
with
respect
to
fowling
gut
extension.
he
could
either
restore
or
pay
the
$250,000
under
that
paragraph
of
the
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
other
fines
were
imposed
on
the
basis
of
$5,000,
his
average
profit
per
lot
for
the
number
of
lots
that
he
unlawfully
filled
in.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
this
case,
that
was
the
way
the
fines
were
imposed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
he's
ordered
to
pay
them.
they're--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and,
to
do
some--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--restoration
work
where
it
needs
to
be
done.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
those
fines
were
not
designed
to
represent
the
cost
of
restoration.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
more
in
the
nature
of
disgorgement
of
profits.
if
one
looks
to
the
history
of
the
clean
water
act,
after
all
the
inquiry
into
an
historical
analog
that's
required
under
this
court's
seventh
amendment
jurisprudence
is
basically
a
two-step
process.
if
one,
the
first
step
is
to
identify
with
some
care
the
particular
modern
statutory
right
and
remedy
that
are
at
issue--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
only
then
can
the
historical
comparison
meaningfully
be
drawn.
and
the
statutory
provision
at
issue
here
is
the
civil
remedy
provisions
of
the
clean
water
act
which
are
applicable
to
all
violations
of
the
clean
water
act,
whether
they
involve
the
filling
of
wetlands
as
in
this
case,
and
it's
a
mistake
to
concentrate
too
much
on
the
filling
of
wetlands,
or
whether
they
involve
discharges
of
pollutants
into
rivers
or
other
waters
of
the
united
states
by
industrial
discharges,
etcetera.
those
are
the
statutes
that
we
are
dealing
with
here.
this
is
the
remedial
provision.
and
the
clean
water
act
originated
as
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
of
1948,
without
any
civil
penalty
provisions.
it
embodied
only
an
embatement
remedy.
the
clean
water
act
embodies
a
series
of
numerous
amendments
that
were
designed
to
strengthen
that
law
over
the
years
and
the
civil
penalty
provisions
were
first
added
to
the
statute
in
1972.
prior
to
that
time
the
abatement
remedy
was
quite
cumbersome
and
relatively
ineffective
to
the
point
where
the
united
states
attorneys
were
more
frequently
relying
on
the
old
rivers
and
harbors
act
remedy
when
they
could.
either
the
civil
injunctive
remedy
or
the
criminal
provisions
but
that
had
certain
disadvantages
in
that
it
didn't
apply
to
sewage
discharges
at
all
or
to
discharges
into
the
tributaries
of
streams
that
were
navigable
in
fact.
the
clean
water
act
has
a
broader
reach
in
that
respect.
and
the
basic
purpose
of
adding
the
civil
penalty
provision
in
1972
was
a
purpose
that
this
court
identified
in
the
albemarle
paper
company
opinion
as
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
back
pay
remedy
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
the
need
to
have
an
incentive,
or
a
spur
or
catalyst
to
bring
about
compliance
with
the
act.
experience
showed
that
this
was
needed
because
otherwise
somebody
could
profit
from
discharging
pollutants
into
the
waters
and
just
wait
to
be
sued
and
for
an
abatement
remedy
to
be
issued.
but,
if--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
criminal
penalty
was
added
at
the
same
time
as
the
civil
penalty
provision
in
1972.
prior
thereto
there
was
no
incentive
in
the
act
to
bring
about
compliance
and
the
criminal
provision
is
sometimes
resorted
to
in
the
case
of
willful
violators.
of
course,
we
have
a
higher
burden
of
proof--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but,
what
it
has
to
do--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--what
it
has
to
do,
it's
essentially
a
recognition
that
this
was
one
ball
of
wax
added
to
in
order
to
accomplish
the
original
purpose
of
the
clean
water
act,
which
is
defined
right
in
the
statute
and
has
been
quoted
by
this
court
to
restore
and
maintain
the
chemical,
physical
and
biological
integrity
of
the
waters.
that
is
the
focus
of
relief
and
what
is
sought
to
be
xxx.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--what
it
has
you
see,
the
civil
penalty
provision
is
an
adjunct
to
that
purpose.
this
is
not
a
statute
designed
to
secure
revenues
for
the
federal
treasury.
it's
a
statute
designed
to
preserve
and
maintain
and
restore
the
waters
in
their
ecosystem.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
either
but,
we're
talking
about
this
statute
and
whether
the
fact
that
the
penalty
provision
is
part
of
the
remedies
changes
the
nature
of
the
equitable
action
that
was
available
prior
to
the
1972
amendments
because
this
additional
remedy
has
been
added.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
not
a
different
action.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
not
a
different
action,
mr.
justice.
it
is
the
same
cause
of
action.
it
is
just
an
additional
remedy
that's
available
to
the
court
at
its
option
under
the
same
cause
of
action.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
not
an
additional
action.
that's
our
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
those
two
cases
both
involved
a
combination
of
two
causes
of
action
with
overlapping
factual
controversies
whereupon
a
collateral
estoppel
effect
would
control
the
legal
cause
of
action
if
the
facts
were
determined
in
the
equitable
cause
of
action.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
recognized
that
it
was
two
causes
of
action
rather
than
one
cause
of
action
with
two
remedies.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
i
don't
think
it's
our
only
argument,
but
i
do
think
that
the
distinction
between
the
beacon
theatres/dairy
queen
line
of
cases
and
what
some
people
take
to
be
a
line
of
cases
in
conflict
with
that
the
porter
line
of
cases
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
mitchell
against
demario
jewelry,
they
did
say
that
remedies
otherwise
available
at
law
could
be
given
by
a
court
of
equity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
to
the
contrary
and
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
is
another
case
pending
before
the
court
on
petition
from
the
eleventh
circuit,
the
mcc
case
in
florida
which
is
being
held
for
this
one,
in
which
we
also
prevailed.
it
was
not
a
wetlands
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
j.
b.
williams
case
you're
speaking
of?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
well,
we
have
taken
the
point
of
view
that
that
case
while
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--apparent
conflict
with
our
two
holdings
under
the
clean
water
act
did
not
have
a
persuasive
answer
to
the
point
that
the
remedies
under
this
act
are
discretionary
and
require
the
exercise
of
equitable
discretion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
want
to
belittle
a
very
scholarly
opinion
on
his
part.
he
later
wrote
an
opinion
that
we
cite
called
securities
and
exchange
commission
against
xxx--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
know,
i
think
he
was
hinting
that
we
might
be,
and
that
is
far
from
our
mind.
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
which
is
also
of
some
persuasiveness,
but
judge
friendly
later
wrote
the
opinion
in
securities
and
exchange
commission
against
commonwealth
chemical
securities
in
which
he
rejected
a
claim
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
for
disgorgement
of
profits
in
an
action
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
federal
court.
he
said
that
that
was
equitable
in
nature
and
has
been
recognized
as
such.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
precisely
the
question
during
the
1977
amendments,
although
no
one
ever
thought
that
it
would
effect
whether
there
was
a
right
to
jury
trial,
but
these
were
the
amendments
at
which
the
policies
of
how
to
calculate
the
penalties
were
most
specifically
considered
by
congress.
and
at
that
time,
the
conference
report
said
that
they
had
decided
against
giving
epa
an
administrative
remedy
for
the
penalties
but
expressed
approval
of
epa's
enforcement
policy
and
said
that
they
were
going
to
wait
and
see
whether
it
will
have
success
"in
implementing
its
penalty
policy
through
the
courts.
"
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
1977
amendments,
the
conference
report,
which
appears
in
volume
123
of
the
congressional
record...
we
have
cited
this...
at
page
39190.
and
appended
to
this
committee
report
then
is
a
letter
from
the
epa
to
senator
muskie,
responding
to
his
request
for
the
agency
to
elaborate
upon
the
agency's
policies
with
regard
to
the
calculation
of
civil
penalties
which
it
had
developed
for
purposes
of
entering
into
settlements
under
the
statute.
and
what
the
agency
points
out
is
that
the
penalties
should
be
utilized
first
of
all
to
at
least
remove
any
economic
gain
achieved
by
non-compliance
and
emphasized
it
was
important
to
do
so
in
order
to
relieve
competitive
inequities
between
industrial
polluters
for
example,
who
would
profit
by
violating
the
law
for
several
years
as
against
their
competitors
who
were
complying
with
the
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it's
not
only
disgorgement
in
these
policies
that
were
approved
by
congress.
i
am
saying
that
these
are
guidance
to
what
we
seek
and
what
the
courts
should
give.
but
they
added
on
that
when
the
degree
of
environmental
harm
is
great
or
the
degree
of
willfulness
something
should
be
added,
then
of
course,
they
discounted
it
by
the
likelihood
of
success.
they
were
talking
about
settlements.
in
some
cases
they
would
defer
or
reduce
it
because
the
payment
of
the
full
amount
would
render
it
too
difficult
for
the
source
of
the
pollution
to
install
the
required
pollution
controls,
et
cetera.
this
requires
a
balancing
of
equities
of
considerations
such
as
these
which
is
equitable
in
nature
and
which
is
not
unfettered
in
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
but
it
still
is
in
the
district
courts
a
proper
exercise
of
discretion
and
the
application
of
the
penalties
would
be
subject
to
proper
appellate
review.
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
albemarle
paper
company,
that
ordinarily
the
back
pay
remedy
should
be
awarded.
it
isn't
up
to
a
district
court
to
decide
without
basis
not
to
award
the
back
pay
remedy
quoting
from
chief
justice
marshall's
opinion
sitting
on
circuit
in
the
aaron
burr
case
that
when
a
matter
is
committed
to
the
discretion
of
a
court
that
means
that
it
is
committed
not
to
its
inclination
but
to
its
judgment
and
that
judgment
must
be
based
on
sound
legal
principles.
so
there
is
some
statutory
guidance
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1977
amendments
for
the
way
the
penalty
provisions
should
be
applied
in
the
exercise
of
discretion.
but
we
had
in
this
case
something
difficult
to
foresee
in
any
guidelines...
the
need
to
put
a
cap
on
the
remedy
that
was
required
because
of
the
filling
in
of
a
waterway,
of
a
navigable
waterway.
there
are
other
possibilities
there.
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
mentioned
there
was
a
subsequent
hearing
in
december
of
1983,
and
this
appears
in
volume
21
of
the
court
of
appeals
appendix,
in
which
petitioner
asked
instead
to
be
allowed
to
re-route
this
canal
through
other
areas
where
he
still
owned
the
land
and
the
court
said
it
couldn't
hear
that
claim
at
that
time
because
he
did
not
substantiate
his
request
with
any
scientific
evidence
and
didn't
have
an
expert
witness
with
him
who
could
substantiate
it.
but
that
possibility
remains
open
for
possible
modification
of
the
decree.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
remedy,
as
in
administration
of
the
statute
in
general,
was
to
try
to
protect
these
wetlands
which
are
on
the
eastern
flyways
and
the
ecosystem
of
these
wetlands.
and
the
penalty
is
very
much
ancillary
and
adjunct
to
this
and
used
to
assure
there
will
be
an
incentive
to
comply
and
to
bring
about
the
purposes
of
the
act,
which
are
to
protect
the
waters.
we
think
that
the
proper
historical
analog,
when
the
act
is
understood
this
way
is
to
the
common
nuisance
or
public
nuisance
cases
that
are
well-recognized
in
opinions
of
this
court,
such
as
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
in
the
steel
workers
and
in
the
english
common
law.
we
have
discussed
it
in
some
detail.
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
takes
issue
with
our
reading
of
one
of
the
english
cases
and
i
would
like
to
refer
briefly
to
that.
on
page
4
of
the
reply
brief,
in
footnote
one
there
is
a
quotation
from
the
english
case
which
we
pointed
to
as
particularly
close
to
ours
in
which
petitioner
contends
that
the
case
turns
on
the
fact
that
the
crown
claimed
ownership
of
all
tidal
lands
including
harbor
lands.
as
we
read
the
case,
we
don't
think
that's
what
it
turns
on.
the
italicized
sentence
in
this
excerpt
is
where
the
question
is
of
nuisance
only
and
the
evidence
doubtful
there
may
be
a
need
for
a
jury
which
probably
referred
to
the
advisory
jury
that
was
used
by
the
chancery.
but
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
question
is
of
nuisance
only.
this
is
a
case,
as
it
goes
on
to
say
of
purpresture
and
nuisance,
purpresture
being
a
form
of
common
or
public
nuisance
where
there
is
an
obstruction
of
a
common
waterway,
so
the
detriments
of
many
people
and
not
just
a
nuisance
to
the
particular
land
owner.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
were
some
factual
disputes.
there
was
no
dispute
that
filling
occurred,
et
cetera,
but
there
was
some
factual
disputes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
well
we
think
that
there
is
no
basis
for
that
and
we
cited
the
appropriate--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--case
law
on
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
jury's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
and
the
juries
might
not
always
be
sympathetic
with
this
kind
of
enforcement
action.
it
would
be
the
same
kind
of
facts
that
the
court
would
determine
in
issuing
an
injunction.
these
aren't
facts
that
a
court
can't
ordinarily
determine.
