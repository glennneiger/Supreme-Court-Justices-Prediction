justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
in
this
case,
he
may
have
done
that.
do
you
think
he
was
required
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--having
computed
$5,000
per
lot
could
he
have
also
said,
well,
this
fellow
had
notice
over
and
over
again,
he
deliberately
did
things
we
told
him
not
to
do,
he's
a
bad
man
for
all
sorts
of
reasons
so
i'll
add
an
extra
$1,000
per
lot.
could
he
have
done
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
measure
is
not
limited
to
the
same
remedy
with
the
inequity,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
couldn't
the
trial
judge
in
a
criminal
case
decide
an
appropriate
fine
would
be
measured
by
the
amount
of
money
the
person
stole
or
something
like
that?
and
that
wouldn't
make
it
disgorgement
would
it?
i
mean
i
suppose
you
can
always
take
it
into
account.
unless
you're
required
to
take
it
into
account,
why
is
that
legally
relevant?
