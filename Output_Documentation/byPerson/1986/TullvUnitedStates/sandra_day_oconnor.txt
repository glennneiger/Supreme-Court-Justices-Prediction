mr.
nageotte,
if
the
language
of
the
statute
had
made
clear
that
the
so-called
civil
sanction
was
to
be
related
to
disgorgement
of
economic
benefit
for
example,
would
you
think
the
seventh
amendment
would
then
guarantee
a
right
to
trial
by
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
would
concede
that
it
could
be
an
equitable
remedy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
possible
that
we
could
interpret
this
statute
as
essentially
one
for
that
type
of
relief
even
though
it's
not
express?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
clarify
one
thing
factually
for
me?
was
your
client
offered
an
opportunity
to
repair
the
damage
or
fill
in
the
canal
in
lieu
of
a
penalty?
