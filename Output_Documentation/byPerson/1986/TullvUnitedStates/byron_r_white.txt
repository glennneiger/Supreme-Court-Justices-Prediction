justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
if
congress
had
vested
the
authority
in
an
administrative
agency
to
impose
a
civil
fine,
i
don't
suppose
you'd
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
are
in
effect
saying
congress
made
its
choice.
it's
put
the
collection
of
penalties
in
the
court
and
they're
stuck
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
xxx
but
is
there
a
jury
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
administrative
mechanism
for
imposing
civil
penalties
under
the
clean
water
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
there,
if
a
government
cleans
up
a
site
or
something
and
spends
money
for
it
does
it
have
a
cause
of
action
to
recover
from
the,
from
a
private
party,
the
cost
of
the
clean
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
an
action
like
that
under
the
clean
water
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
were
would
you
suppose
a
jury
trial
would
be
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
just
says,
when
the,
if
the
government
undoes
the
pollution
they
can
sue
the
party
responsible
for
the
costs
of
undoing
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
yes,
for
money,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
isn't
disgorging?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
may
have
taken
it,
but
you've
done
something
to
me
and
i
refuse
to
pay
you
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
forever
to
the
expense
to
the
government
for
cleaning
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
does
it
have,
is
it,
should
it
have
some
relation
to
the
cost
of
undoing
the
pollution
if
you're
ever
going
to
undo
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx...
but
you
also
had
the
order
to
restore.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
what
was
the,
and
what
were
the
fines
imposed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
could,
he
had
never
recovered
those
fines.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
ordered
to
pay
them
and
to
restore?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
where
does
that
leave--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well
so
how
does,
where
does
that
leave
these
fines
that
he
can't
get
out
of?
he
has
these
fines
to
pay
but
he
also
has
to
restore.
so
the
fines
can
hardly
be
to
represent
the
cost
of
restorations
since
he's
going
to
have
to
do
that
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
are
just
plain
old
fines.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
first
time
it's
ever
come
up
in
a
court
of
appeals,
the
right
to
jury
trial
on
a
civil
penalty
under
the
clean
water
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
take
the
same
view
towards
the
court
of
appeals
case,
judge
friendly's
case,
as
the
fourth
circuit
did
in
this
case
where
he
said--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
out
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
think
of
how
efficient
it
would
have
been
to
have
an
administrative
agency
to
collect
these
fines.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
wallace,--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
order
to
win
your
case
and
cases
like
this,
in
this
particular
case
were
there
real
factual
disputes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
it
be
a
really
serious
matter
for
a
jury,
those
factual
disputes?
i
take
it
there
is
some
claim
on
the
other
side
that
the
jury
would
have
to
determine
the
penalty
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--put
that
aside--
justice
byron
r.
white
--put
that
aside.
you
think
in
the
run
of
the
mill
case
like
this
it
really
wouldn't
be
a
terrific
burden
on
the
government
to
have
a
jury
because
of
the
complicated
facts
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
cost
money
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
nageotte,
are
you
really
serious
in
your
claim
that
the
jury
would
have
to
set,
if
you
have
a
right
to
jury
trial,
you
have
a
right
to
have
the
jury
set
the
fine?
