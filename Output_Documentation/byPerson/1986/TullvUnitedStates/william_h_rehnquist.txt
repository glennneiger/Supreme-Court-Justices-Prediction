chief

h.
rehnquist
mr.
nageotte,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nageotte,
we
granted
certiorari
only
on
the
jury
trial
issue
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
mugler
a
state
court
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
seventh
amendment
wouldn't
be
involved
there
anyway.
i
mean,
that
wouldn't
be
precedent
against
the
use
of
the
seventh
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
even
if
it
had
been
the
seventh
amendment
has
never
been
held
to
guarantee
jury
trial
in
state
courts.
your
client
was
tried
in
a
federal
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
nageotte.
i'll
hear
from
you
now,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
were
you
arguing
in
the
district
court
was
the
$1,000
a
day,
i
gather
from
your
opponent.
or,
$10,000
a
day.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
that
doesn't
sound
like
it
has
anything
to
do
with
restitution.
that
sounds
like
it's
a
penalty
or
a
fine,
you
know,
thirty
days/$30,
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
in
addition
to
the
plan
you
also
asked
for
these
civil
penalties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
page
61
(a),
the
page
right
after,
when
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
judge
goes
on
to
say
for
the
unlawful
filling
of
a
navigable
waterway
of
the
united
states,
the
defendant
shall
pay
a
fine
in
the
sum
of
$250,000.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
doesn't
seem
to
say
there
that
that's
tied
into
any
restoration
costs.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
had
both
set
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
walsh,
you
had
those
same
kind
of
things
in
beacon
theatres
and
dairy
queen
and
the
court
said
where
it's
equitable
you
go
without
a
jury,
but
where
you
add
in
something
that
is
legal
then
you
get
a
jury
trial.
i
don't
think
the
whole
ball
of
wax
argument
works.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i'm
sure
it
could
have
been
argued
that
it
was
all
one
ball
of
wax
and
that
sort
of
thing,
but
the
court
said,
no,
you
don't
get
off
that
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
this
turns
on
whether
we
decide
that
these
claims
on
the
complaint
on
the
clean
water
act
are
"one
cause
of
action"
or
"two
causes
of
action"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
porter
case
never
referred
in
any
place
to
the
right
to
jury
trial.
i
just
re-read
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
i
don't
think
you
can
take
that
phrase
or
that
dicta
and
apply
it
to
the
jury
trial
situation
when
there
was
no
question
of
jury
trial
rights
in
porter.
have
you
prevailed
on
this
claim
before
any
other
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--judge
friendly
didn't
understand
the
one
ball
of
wax
doctrine.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
nageotte,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nageotte.

case
