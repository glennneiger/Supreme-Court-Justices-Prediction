mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
constitutional
issue
for
decision
in
this
case
this
afternoon
is
whether
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
finds
himself
to
be
the
defendant
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
federal
government
in
a
federal
court,
that
is
a
federal
district
court,
under
a
federal
statute,
subjecting
that
citizen
to
a
substantial
civil
penalty,
whether
that
citizen
is
entitled
to
trial
by
jury
under
the
seventh
amendment.
the
facts
briefly
stated
in
this
case
are
that
in
july
1981,
the
federal
government,
the
department
of
justice,
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
norfolk
alleging
that
mr.
tull
had
filled
properties,
had
developed
properties
and
in
some
cases
had
sold
those
properties,
in
some
cases
more
than
five
years
prior
to
filing
this
suit.
in
all
cases
at
least
more
than
six
months
last
property
having
been
filled
and
partially
sold
in
december,
1980.
the
complaint
in
that
case,
while
it
did
ask
for
a
conclusionary
injunctive
relief,
the
primary
thrust
of
that
case
was
to
impose
substantial
civil
penalties.
interestingly
in
this
case,
mr.
tull,
in
1976,
in
order
to
avoid
just
this
result,
upon
the
advice
of
his
attorney
had
asked
for
a
jurisdictional
inspection
to
be
made
by
the
district
engineer
who
is
charged
with
enforcement
of
the
statute.
this
jurisdictional
inspection
was
made
in
july
of
1976
by
no
less
than
the
district
engineer
and
eight
key
people
of
this
department,
including
several
department
heads
and
two
attorneys.
and
the
attorney's
specific
job
was
to
make
jurisdictional
determinations
to
determine
whether
or
not
permits
were
required.
mr.
tull
proceeded
with
his
activity
after
having
been
told
that
in
only
two
locations
were
permits
required.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
simply
trying
to
briefly
summarize
the
facts.
mr.
tull
demanded
a
jury
trial.
that
jury
trial
demand
was
denied
on
the,
and
the
basis
of
the
trial
court's
denial
was
that
all
issues
in
this
case
were
equitable
or
in
regards
to
opinions
requested
from
the
court.
the
case
today
falls
squarely
within
the
case
of
curtis
v.
loether,
the
only
distinction
being
that
in
that
case
the
issue,
the
legal
relief
was
punitive
damages
and
in
this
case
it
is
civil
penalties.
we
would
point
out
that
the
government
suggests
that
this
case
involves
disgorgement
of
profits
as
a
form
of
equitable
relief.
say
to
the
court
that
the
complainant
in
this
case
made
no
mention
of
disgorgement
of
profits
or
profits
in
any
regard.
in
both
counts
one,
two
and
three
of
the
complaint
filed
in
this
case,
the
government
asked
for
the
imposition
of
civil
penalties
under
that
provision
of
the
statute,
33
u.s.c.
1319(d).
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
that
would
really
depend
on
the
precise
language
used.
of
course,
disgorgement,
if
properly
disgorgement
under
the
equitable
principles
of
disgorgement
could
be
an
equitable
remedy
bestowed
in
this
statute
by
congress
in
any
number
of
ways.
but
whether
or
not
it
is
in
fact
an
equitable
remedy,
in
other
words
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--yes.
i
don't
like
the
term
disgorgement.
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
correct,
but
restitution
is
probably
a
more
appropriate
term.
restitution
has
always
been
a
form
of
equitable
relief
that
is
to
put
the
parties
into
the
same
position
that
they
would
have
been
in
but
for
the
action.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
that
that
could
be
done
in
this
case
for
this
very
specific
reason.
justice
marshall,
in
his
opinion
in
curtis
v.
loether,
pointed
it
out
and
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
albemarle
paper
pointed
it
out.
the
distinction
between
an
equitable
remedy
and
the
discretion
of
the
equitable
court
is
whether
or
not
under
the
statute
the
imposition
of
relief
is
discretionary,
irrespective
of
the
act
of
the
violation.
and
in
this
particular
statute
you
don't
have
that.
i
believe
justice,
chief
justice
white's
exact
words
were
to
the
extent
that
discretion
is
replaced
by
words
which
follow
as
a
matter
of
course.
if
33
u.s.c.
1319(d),
which
is
the
civil
penalty
provision
of
the
clean
water
act,
it
requires
that
on
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
statute
that
a
civil
penalty
be
imposed,
so
for
that
reason
i
say
it's
no
longer,
it's
not
discretionary.
now,
of
course,
if
that
whole
wording
was
changed
then
perhaps,
but
that's--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--yes,
your
honor,
he
was.
but
it
really
was
not
an
option
because
as
the
trial
court
noted
this
ditch,
which
the
court
called
a
canal,
had
been
filled
in
as
much
as
five
years
before
this
suit
was
brought
and
the
government
watched
this
whole
thing
being
filled
in.
it
stood,
stayed
back
and
did
nothing,
notwithstanding
an
affirmative
obligation
of
the
district
engineer
to
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order.
but
irrespective
of
that,
mr.
tull
had
already
filled,
developed
and
sold
each
and
every
one
of
those
lots
that
that
ditch
went
through.
and
he
had
sold
them
to
third
parties;
he
could
not
get
them
back.
the
court
recognizes,
the
trial
court
recognizes
that
numerous
points
in
the
trial
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
in
addition
to
that
we
came
in
after
the
trial
and
asked
for
an
option
to
restore
the
ditch
in
a
different
location
because
he
could
not
restore
it
in
the
original
location.
so
the,
it's
a
very
long
answer
to
your
question,
but
the
answer
is
that
if
he
still
owned
it,
perhaps
he
could,
but
he
couldn't
in
this
case
and
so
that
restoration
really
didn't
come
into
it.
it
was
a
remedy
that
was
moot
at
the
time
it
was
offered.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
if
you
look
at
the
statute--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--yes,
sir.
shall
be.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
shall
be
subject,
i
read
the
words,
"shall
be"
to
require
the
imposition
of
some
penalty
and
that's
the
government's
position
in
most
of
these
cases,
that
it's
not
a
discretionary
item,
that
the
court
must
impose
some
civil
penalty
in
each
case.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
well,
if
you
read,
if
you
read
it
together
with
the
criminal
penalties
which
are
provided
in
33
u.s.c.
1319(c),
the
criminal
penalties
provide
for
a
willful
or
negligent
violation.
so
the
civil
penalties
are
imposed
even
in
cases
where
there's
no
willful
or
wrongful
intent--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
no,
your
honor,
these
are...
this
is
simply
from
my
experience
in
trying
these
cases
at
the
district
court
level.
that's
the
position
the
government
takes
in
argument
to
the
trial
court
that
there
is
no
discretion,
based
on
that
language
in
the
statute.
the,
getting
to,
back
if
i
could
to
this
disgorgement
of
profits
as
equitable
relief
as
raised
by
the
government,
first
of
all
i
would
point
out
that
in
all
three
counts
of
the
complaint
the
relief
sought
specifically
by
the
government
in
each
count
was
civil
penalties
under
the
civil
penalty
provision
of
the
statute.
there
were
no
other
either
specific
statutory
allegations
or
factual
allegations
which
would
lend
themselves
to
a
position
of
disgorgement
of
profit.
i
went
back
through
after
reading
that
in
the
government's
brief
and
looked
at
the
closing
argument
of
the
government.
with
respect
to
eel
creek
the
closing
argument
of
the
government
was
that
there
was
one
day
of
violation;
they
were
entitled
to
a
$10,000
fine
equating
a
day
of
violation
to
a
day
of
fill.
with
regard
to
mire
pond
i,
they
said
there
was
ten
days
of
filling,
they
were
entitled
to
a
$100,000.
with
respect
to
ocean
breeze
they
said
there
was
a
hundred
days
of
filling
and
for
ocean
breeze
they
were
entitled
to
a
$1,000,000
in
civil
penalties.
i
also
checked
their
post
trial
brief
and
the
post
trial
brief
specifically
said
the
united
states
seeks
a
mandatory
injunction
against
the
defendant
for
restoration,
a
permanent
injunction
against
further
filling
on
the
island
without
first
checking
with
the
army
corps
of
engineers
to
determine
whether
the
location
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
corps
and
civil
penalties
for
every
day
of
violation.
there
was
never
at
any
time
throughout
this
case
any
suggestion
that
what
the
court
sought
was
disgorgement
of
profits.
i'd
also
take
issue
to
the
government's
position
that
the
court
in
this
case
could
of,
that
somehow
the
civil
penalties
were
transformed
into
some
type
of
equitable
relief
from
legal
relief
and
that
this
constituted,
or
was
within
equity's
power
to
provide
complete
relief.
the...
as
i
see
it,
the
government's
position
on
that
is
not
founded
by
the
case
law.
it's
clear
from
the
cases
of
this
court
and
the
point
the
government
seems
to
miss
is
that
an
item
such
as
penalties,
forfeitures,
and
punitive
damages,
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case
civil
penalties
are
most
closely
analogous
to
punitive
damages,
that
in
those
situations
equity
never
had
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
and
never
could
award
that
type
of
relief.
so,
when
you
talk
about
equity
granting
complete
relief
you're
talking
about
things
like
perhaps
in
those
cases
where
it
takes,
where
it
took,
before
merger
at
least,
money
of
some
fashion
to
make
the
parties
whole
and
porter
v.
warner
holding
company
made
that
clear
in
that
case
the
restitution
of
rent
money
was
all
right
but
they
said
that
the
civil
penalties
were
a
wholly
different
matter--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
as
your
honor's
opinion
for
unanimous
court
in
atlas
roofing
said
that
if
it's
in
an
administrative
agency
there's
no
seventh
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
well
absolutely,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
i'd
use
the
term,
"stuck
with
it"--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--yes,
justice
white,
and
it
was,
and
they
knew,
i
mean
they
knew,
we
have,
what
we
have
is
a
coin
that
has
heads
and
tails.
on
the
heads
side
is
your
opinion
in
atlas
roofing
and
the
tails
side
is
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
curtis
v.
loether,
both
unanimous
decisions,
different
sides
of
the
coin.
in
this
case
the
federal
government
opted
for
trial
in
the
district
court
and
so
fully
must
of
intended
the
seventh
amendment
to
apply
when
civil
penalties
were
sought.
i'd
just
like
to,
if
i
could,
point
out
that
this
court
in
elizabeth--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--no,
sir.
not
at--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--not
in
this
context
in
this
case.
the
clean
water
act
covers
numerous
things
that
have
to
do
with
other
areas
like
npds
permits
and
that
type
of
thing.
but
in
the
context
of
filling
wetlands
that
comes
clearly
within
this
one
which
is
just
simply
the
various
forms
of
relief.
and
i
think
that
distinction
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
while
we
discuss
congress'
intent,
because
you
see
unlike
the
statute,
the
title
viii
statute
in
curtis
v.
loether
where
the
cause
of
action
and
all
of
the
relief
including
the
injunctive
relief
which
was
equitable
and
the
legal
relief
in
the
form
of
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
were
a
part
of
the
same
section
of
the
same
statute.
in
this
case
congress
went
out
of
its
way
to
break
apart
the
legal
and
equitable
relief.
the
equitable
relief
is
provided
in
33
u.s.c.
1319(b);
criminal
relief
in
33
u.s.c.
1319(c);
and
legal
relief
in
the
form
of
civil
penalties
in
33
u.s.c.
1319(d).
now
if
the
follow
the
government's
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion
then
the
criminal
penalties
of
33
u.s.c.
1319(c)
are
magically
transformed
into
equitable
relief
because
all
three
flow
from
one
cause
of
action,
violation
of
the
clean
water
act.
and,
that's
the
same
thing
that
justice
marshall
dealt
with
in
curtis
v.
loether.
the
punitive
damages
and
compensatory
damages
flow
from
the
single
cause
of
action,
violation
of
the
fair
housing
statute.
the--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--justice
marshall,
as
a
trial
lawyer,
i
would
never
be
satisfied
with
any
advisory
jury
because
i...
well,
i
have
to
say
as
a
trial
lawyer
i
take
anything
i
can
get,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
advisory
jury
can
supplement
the
seventh
amendment
requirement
for
a
jury
because
we
have
issues
out
of
chancery
in
which
there
are--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--it's...
well,
it's
rarely,
i
just
have
to
say
from
my
own
experience
in
virginia
it's
not
granted
very
often
anymore
because
the
trial
court
just
usually
doesn't
grant
it.
if
you
can
show
a
very
clear
situation
in
which
there's
a
direct
conflict
of
evidence
which
needs
to
be
resolved
or
something
like
that
perhaps
you
can
get
them,
but
it
doesn't
help
a,
it
doesn't
help
a
defendant
because
it
does
exactly
what
the
seventh
amendment
was
designed
not
to
do
and
that
is
to
put
back
in
the
hands
of
a
judge
or
the
government,
whether
or
not
the
citizen
gets
a
trial
by
his
peers,
a
jury.
and
that's
precisely
what
the
seventh
amendment
sought
to
avoid.
and
it
doesn't
help
the
defendant
in
federal
court
or
any
court
if
you
say,
well,
you
can
have
a
jury
if
we
decide
we'll
give
you
one,
but
you
can't
have
one
as
a
matter
of
your
right
under
the
constitution.
the
cases,
elizabeth
v.
american
nicholson
said
that
punitive
damages
could
not
be
awarded
in
an
equity
court.
and
also,
and
more
importantly
in
livingston
v.
woodworth
this
court
says
that
punitive
damages
are
incompatible
with
the
principles
and
practices
of
equity
and
for
the
same
reason
civil
penalties
are
incompatible
with
the
principle
and
practice
of
equity,
because
equity
courts
were
never
designed
to
punish
and
that's
what
civil
penalties
do.
that's
what
punitive
damages
do.
they
punish.
i
point
out,
if
i
could,
that
the
government
statement
in
mugler,
that
the
seventh
amendment
did
not
apply
to
causes
of
action
which
were
nuisance
and
tryable
inequity.
that's
certainly
the
true
test
of
the
law,
but
mugler
like
all
of
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
government
did
not
hold
that
an
equity
court
can
impose
penalties,
fines,
forfeitures
of
punitive
damages.
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
well
perhaps,
but
most
clearly,
most
clearly
there
was,
jury
trial
was
never
even
an
issue
in
mugler.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the,
i
had
prepared
a,
quite
a
detailed
analysis
of
curtis
v.
loether
versus
this
case,
but
i
won't
have
time
to
give
it.
i
certainly
would
ask
that
the
court
consider
the
petitioner's
brief
in
curtis
v.
loether
against
the
government's
brief
in
this
case.
they
precisely
mirror
on
all
of
the
points
that
the
government
seeks,
and
as
we
point
out
this
court
unanimously
rejected
those
positions.
i
would
state
that
the,
it's
important
to
discuss
for
a
moment
this
business
of
equitable
relief
whether
it's
incidental
to,
or
part
of
the
equitable
clean
up
doctrine
for
just
a
moment
for
this
reason,
it's
very
important
to
trial
lawyers
and
trial
judges
that
we
don't
go
back
to
the
old
rule
which
has
since
been
discarded
by
dairy
queen,
beacon
theatres
and
ross
v.
bernhard
for
this
reason.
under
the
requirements
of
notice
pleading
only
in
the
federal
court,
when
you
have
to
decide
somewhere
along
in
the
trial
whether
equitable
relief
is
really
incidental
to
the
legal
relief
sought
which
is
the
main
case,
or
the
legal
relief
is
merely
incidental
to
the
equitable
relief
as
you
go
along
through
the
trial.
and
on
the
other
hand
you
have
to
make
your
jury
trial
demand
with
the
first,
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
you
have
to
do
these
things.
what's
going
to
happen
if
we
ever
go
back
to
that
old
rule,
you're
going
to
end
up
half
way
down
the
line
in
a
trial
and
find
out
that
based
on
the
evidence
that
came
in
because
there
was
notice
pleading
that
you
may
have
to
go
back
and
redo
the
whole
thing
and
then
afford
a
jury.
it's
better
to
leave
it
the
way
it
is
with
dairy
queen
and
ross
v.
bernhard
to
insure
that
that
doesn't
happen.
simply
have
the
civil
penalties,
or
punitive
damages
or
forfeitures
be
the
legal
relief
which
is
split
off
from
the
equitable
relief
tried
first
as
to
issues
of
fact
and
the
relief
and
then
the
court
can
provide
whatever
additional
equitable
relief
might
be
necessary
in
the
case.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
particular
case
it's
clear
that
when
you
apply
the
three
element
test
which
justice
white
set
out
in
ross
v.
bernhard,
it's
clear
that
the
civil
penalties
require
a
jury
trial.
those
three
elements
are:
what
was
the
pre-merger
custom
with
reference
to
such
questions.
now
as
we
point
out
there's
no
question
here
in
this
case
that
as
to
civil
penalties
the
pre-merger
custom
would
have
been
trial
by
a
jury
because
equity
courts
simply,
even
though
they
had
jurisdiction
to
award
complete
relief,
never
had
jurisdiction
to
award
penalties
or
punitive
damages.
second,
i'd
also
point
out
that
in
the
case
of
hepner
v.
united
states,
and
i
acknowledge
to
some
extent
the
character
of
that,
of
those
statements
that
of
course,
they
were
entitled
to
have
a
jury
summoned.
i've
seen
it
written
as
dictum,
on
the
other
hand
that's
pretty
strong
dictum
when
you
cannot
impose,
or
when
you
cannot
get
to
the
underlying
question,
which
in
those
cases
were
whether
or
not
a
directed
verdict
could
be
granted,
whether
that
would,
whether
that
would
violate
the
seventh
amendment.
in
the
government's
brief,
their
own
brief,
their
own
brief
in
that
case
said
that
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
distinction
between
civil
action
for
penalties
and
technical
criminal
prosecution
was
an
old
distinction
in
common
law,
well-known
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
as
we
cite
in
our
brief.
penalty
actions
were
well
known
at
that
time.
secondly,
in
their
supplemental
brief
at
page
7
and
8
in
hepner
the
government
said,
we
answered
that
such
a
suit
is
not
a
criminal
prosecution,
that
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
a
jury
at
all,
except
be
it
under
the
seventh
amendment
as
to
civil
actions
and
then
in
such
actions
the
court
can
direct
a
verdict.
last,
i'd
simply
point
out
that
in
this
case
the
civil
penalties
are
clearly,
when
you
compare
them,
with
punitive
damages,
clearly
on
all
fours
match
punitive
damages.
even
in
the
epa
guidelines
they
say,
and
these
are
guidelines
of
june
3,
1977,
and
civil
penalties
bear
similarities
to
punitive
damages.
they
were
imposed
in
this
case
as
punishment.
last--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--not
in--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--under
the
clean
water
act,
no,
justice,
i
would
say
under
this
particular
section
of
the
clean
water
act,
it's
different
than
recwa
and
the
answer
is
no.
they
can
have
injunctive
relief,
they
can
have
civil
penalties
and
they
can
have
criminal
relief,
but
there
is
no
suit
for
compensatory
damages
as
such.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
well,
i
would
have
to
see
it
in
that
context
but
i
would
suspect--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--well,
if
what
resulted
was
a
judgment,
an
enforceable
judgment--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--for
money,
then
i
would
say
that
the
seventh
amendment
would
apply.
if
it
were
some
other
category
and
that's
the
distinction,
is
that
it's
a
money
judgment?
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
well,
i
wouldn't
see
where
clean
up
costs
would
be
disgorgement
in
that
sense.
disgorgement
presupposes
that
i
have
taken
something
from
you
and
won't
give
it,
unlawfully,
and
i
won't
give
it
back
and
therefore
you
have
to
force
me
to
give
it
back
to
you.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
well
now
that's
a,
now
that's
a
different
story
when,
if
it's
an
action
in
debt--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--or
an
action
in
assumpsit
then
you
have
a
little
different
situation.
that's
not
disgorgement,
that's
not
disgorgement,
that,
otherwise
we
could
simply
wipe
it
up
with
seventh
amendment
xxx.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
yes,
sir,
justice
scalia,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
takes
more,
i
was
answering
it
strictly
in
the
frame
of--
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
--justice
white's
question
if
it
was
a
money
judgment
to
get
x
dollars
because
i
went
out
and
had
to
do
something.
that's
the
same
as
a
breach
of
contract
action.
if
i
agree
to
you
sell
you
widgets
and
i
breach
and
i
won't
sell,
you
have
to
go
buy
the
widgets
somewhere
else.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
yeah.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
that's
correct.
but,
being
a
money
judgment
is
one
of
the
factors
involved
because
there
are
judgments
other
than
money
judgments.
last
was
the
practical
limitation
of
juries.
i've
just
stated
that
it's
obvious
that
juries
routinely
hear
antitrust,
medical
malpractice,
products
liability.
they
can
handle
those
cases.
there
is
no
practical
limitation
for
a
jury
to
hear
a
clean
water
act
case.
thank
you.
xxx.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
unless
there
are
any
questions
from
the
court
i
really
have
nothing
further
to
add.
mr.
richard
n.
nageotte
yes,
your
honor.
both
find
the
facts
and
to
set
the
amount
of
the
civil
penalty,
the
same
as
they
would
in
a
case
of
punitive
damages,
where
they
would
set
the
amount
of
the
punitive
damages
using
the
same
grace
factors.
