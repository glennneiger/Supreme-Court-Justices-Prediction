justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
nageotte,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
is
no
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
a
civil
penalty
shall
be
imposed
under
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
says
that
any
person
who
commits
a
violation
shall
be
subject
to
a
civil
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
shall
be
subject
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
someone
is
subject
to
deportation,
it
means
he
must
be
deported.
if
someone
is,
if
someone
who
commits
a
particular
crime
is
subject
to
death,
it
means
the
death
penalty
must
be
imposed?
i
don't
read
the
phrase,
"subject
to"
that
categorically.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
that
you're
subject
to
them.
i'm
just...
do
you
have
any
case
that
says
that,
that
a
penalty
must
be
imposed,
that
the
court
has
no
discretion
not
to
impose
a
penalty
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
key
is
not
whether
it's
a
money
judgment.
because
you
get
a
money
judgment
in
disgorgement
and
you
get
a
money
judgment
in
restitution
which
you
acknowledge
is
equitable
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
the
key
is
what
it's
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
that
it's
a
money
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
addressed
it
at
all.
you've
just
said
some
penalty
ordinarily
is
assessed
xxx--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
you
addressed
whether
it
must
be
assessed.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
willfulness
one
of
them?
just
sheer
willfulness?
how
much
warning
the
individual
had?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
went
crashing
ahead--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
even
though
he
caused--
justice
antonin
scalia
--little
damage
to
the
government
you'd
hit
that
kind
of
an
individual
a
lot
harder?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we're
looking
for
analogues
to
the
action,
mr.
wallace,
not
to
analogues
to
what
happened
to
have
been
done
by
the
judge
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
disgorgement
if
not
an
analog
to
the
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if
they
used
a
criminal
penalty
for
that
purpose,
you
wouldn't
be
here
arguing
that
you
don't
need
a
jury
trial
xxx--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what,
my
point
is,
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
what
i
understand
everyone
agrees
is
the
issue
before
us,
whether
in
1791
this
would
have
been
essentially
an
equitable
or
a
legal
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
anymore
than
the
fact
that
it
added
the
criminal
penalty
later
to
achieve
the
original
goals
of
the
act
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
that's
a
criminal
action
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
that's
very
interesting,
but
that's
the
purpose
of
the
criminal
penalty
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
don't
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
point
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
penalty
provisions
normally
are?
civil
penalties
are
mainly
designed
to
raise
revenue.
they
may
not
be.
in
an
another
statute--
--they're
usually
designed
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--nobody
is
arguing
that
the
nature
of
the
other
action,
which
is
equitable,
is
altered.
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
nature
of
that
action
is
altered
the
issue
is
whether
this
action
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
the
chief
justice
was
belittling
it,
i
don't
think
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
are
you
saying
that
the
government
is
only
going
to
seek
that
degree
of
penalty
in
the
future,
only
disgorgement?
