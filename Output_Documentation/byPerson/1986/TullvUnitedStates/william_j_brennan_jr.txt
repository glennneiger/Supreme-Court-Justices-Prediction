justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tull
versus
the
united
states
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
government
sued
the
petitioner
in
this
case
for
civil
penalties
of
$22,890,000
for
violations
of
the
clean
water
act.
the
question
for
decision
is
whether
the
seventh
amendment
guaranteed
petitioner
right
for
a
jury
trial
on
both
liability
and
the
amount
of
the
penalty.
petitioner
demanded
a
jury
trial,
and
the
demand
was
denied
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
also
rejecting
petitioner's
arguments
that
under
the
seventh
amendment
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
we
reverse
and
remand.
we
hold,
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
that
this
suit
for
civil
penalties
is
analogous
to
an
action
for
debt,
within
the
jurisdiction
of
english
courts
of
law
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
seventh
amendment,
and
therefore
that
petitioner's
liability
for
penalties
must,
on
the
next
demand,
be
tried
by
a
jury.
but
we
hold
further
that
the
statute,
which
provides
that
the
amount
of
the
penalty
if
the
jury
finds
liability,
shall
be
assessed
by
trial
judges
and
not
by
the
jury
does
not
infringe
on
the
constitutional
right
for
a
jury
trial.
