mr.
staring,
do
you
concede
that
it
was
foreseeable
that
the
valves
would
reach
california?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
argue
that
foreseeability
alone
is
not
enough,
anyway.
justice

o'connor
by
that
what
do
you
mean,
that
that
should
be
the
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there
has
to
be
a
different
test
for
a
component
manufacturer
than
the
primary
manufacturer?
justice

the
asahi
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
it
began
as
a
product
liability
suit
in
california
state
court
by
an
injured
person
against
the
taiwanese
manufacturer
of
tires.
the
defendant,
tire
manufacturer,
filed
a
cross
complaint
against
the
petitioner
asahi
metal
industry,
a
japanese
supplier
of
tire
valves.
some
of
which
were
incorporated
in
the
tires
manufactured
and
sold
california.
asahi
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
california
states
court
asserting
its
contacts
with
california
were
insufficient
to
provide
the
minimum
context
with
forum
state,
which
the
due
process
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
requires.
the
supreme
court
of
california
upheld
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
over
asahi.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
all
members
of
the
court
agree
that
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
the
petitioner
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
fails
to
comport
with
fair
play
and
substantial
justice.
the
court
is
divided
however
with
regard
to
other
aspects
of
the
analysis.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
in
which
justices
white,
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
in
which
justices
white
and
blackmun
have
joined.
