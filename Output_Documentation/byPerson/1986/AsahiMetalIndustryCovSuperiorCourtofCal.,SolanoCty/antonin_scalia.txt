you
may
as
well
give
that
away,
because
the
california
court
found
foreseeability.
you
don't
expect
us
to
reverse
that
on
this
record,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
found
foreseeability.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
you
want
to
end
the
fog?
where
would
you
draw
the
line?
suppose
i
am
the
ultimate
manufacturer,
but
not
the
exporter?
that
is
to
say,
i
manufacture
washing
machines,
the
totality
of
them,
including
all
of
the
components,
and
i
sell
the
washing
machine
to...
let's
say
in
japan,
to
a
company
which
i
know
exports
them,
and
i
know
they
export
them
to
the
united
states,
and
indeed
i
know
they
export
them
to
california.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
understand
you,
i
have
to
be
the
one
who
sends
the
thing
into
the
market.
is
that
where
you're
drawing
the
line?
i
have
to
be
the
one
that
sends
it?
it's
not
enough
that
i
know
i
am
delivering
it
to
someone
who
will
send
it
there?
the
sending
of
it
there
has
to
be
my
doing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now
you're
getting
foggy.
see,
i
suddenly
don't
see
the
line
any
more.
why
isn't
it
encouraging
the
sending
it
there
to
deliver
the
equipment
knowing
that
once
i
deliver
it
it's
going
to
be
sent
there?
if
we
had
a
law
of
accessory
applicable
to
this,
i'd
certainly
be
an
accessory
to
the
sending
of
it
there,
wouldn't
i?
