mr.
staring,
straighten
out
a
couple
of
details
for
me.
are
there
any
other
cross-claims
filed
against
you
in
this
case
by
california
citizens?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
accident?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
see.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
a
choice
of
law
clause
in
the
contracts
between
your
client
and
cheng
shin?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
thank
you.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
original
plaintiff
had
not
settled?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
that's
correct.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
doesn't
the
record
show
an
investigation
and
finding
of
your
valves
in
california?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
improper
material
in
the
record?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
not
sure
about
great
reliance,
but
does
the
record
show
the
presence
of
your
valves
in
the
state
of
california?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
my
impression.
