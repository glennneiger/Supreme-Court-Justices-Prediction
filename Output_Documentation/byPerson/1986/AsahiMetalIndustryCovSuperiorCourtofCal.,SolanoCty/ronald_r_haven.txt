mr.
ronald
r.
haven
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
members
of
the
court:
i'd
like
to
point
out
first
of
all,
getting
right
into
the
factual
background
of
this
case,
that
the
record
is
totally
devoid
of
there
being
any
contract
whatsoever
between
the
parties.
there's
no
indication
of
anything
more
than
the
fact
of
a
sale,
the
terms
of
which
have
not
been
made
a
part
of
this
record.
let
me
point
out
that
when
the
motion
to
quash
was
initially
heard
back
in
1983,
the
last
declaration
to
come
in
in
support
of
the
motion
to
quash
was
from
mr.
matsoko
in
support
of
the
motion.
he
is
with
asahi.
there
was
never
any
mention
made
of
any
contract
in
the
course
of
his
affidavit,
nor
in
his
affidavit
were
there
any
denials
of
any
kind
that
asahi
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
cheng
shin
and
other
manufacturers
distributed
in
the
united
states
and
in
california.
he
had
ample
opportunity
to
make
that
denial
if
he
chose
to
do
so,
and
it
was
never
done.
therefore,
up
until
the
point
of
the
reply
brief
in
this
case
it
has
always
been
taken
by
the
court
as
a
given,
if
you
will,
that
asahi
was
well
aware
of
the
distribution
system
of
cheng
shin,
which
included
the
united
states
and
california.
it
was
also
taken
by
the
court
as
a
given
that
asahi
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
distribution
system
of
honda,
bridgestone,
yokahama,
ifc,
and
others
included
the
united
states
and
california.
it
is
also
a
matter
of
common
knowledge.
it
would
be
commercially
unreasonable
to
accept
the
proposition
that
asahi
is
selling
one
and
a
quarter
million
valves
to
cheng
shin
over
the
course
of
a
five
year
period,
150,000
in
'78,
500,000
in
'79,
500,000
in
1980--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--how
many
tires
did
cheng
shin
make?
i
don't
have
that
information.
i
don't
know
what
percentage
of
asahi's
valves
went
onto
cheng
shin's
tires.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
it
might
have
been
a
half
of
one
percent,
but
that's
still
a
lot
of
valves.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
20
percent
of
cheng
shin's
business
in
the
united
states
comes
to
california.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
nobody
could
say
absolutely
that
they
knew
that
one
of
their
valves
would
in
fact--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
the
percentage
odds
are
against
it.
however,
we
found
that
a
lot
of
them
are
here,
or
a
lot
of
them
are
in
california,
anyway.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
no,
there's
a
lot
more
than
that,
something
like
267.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
if
asahi
knows
that
cheng
shin
and
other
worldwide
distributors
of
tire
tubes
are
distributing
in
the
united
states
and
specifically
in
california,
and
asahi
continues
year
after
year
after
year
to
sell--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--they
take
advantage
of
a
systematic
method
of
distribution
that
they
know
covers
the
united
states
and
california,
and
i
think
that
rises
to
the
level
of
an
expectation.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
cheng
shin,
i
believe.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
they
sell
replacement
tubes.
i
know
that
they
also
sell
some
bicycle
tubes
that
come
on
schwinn
bicycles.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
right.
we're
talking
about
the
tube.
we
must
remember
that
the
valve
is
really
the
only
mechanical
part
of
the
tube.
it's
a
very
significant
part.
the
rest
of
the
tube
is
nothing
other
than
an
air-filled
rubber
donut.
the
one
mechanical
part
is
the
valve
that
goes
on
it.
and
the
valve
stem
itself
is
supplied
to
cheng
shin
already
attached
to
an
oval
rubber
base,
and
it's
that
rubber
base
that
is
melded
into
the
tube
itself.
and
in
this
case,
the
question
of
fact
at
the
time
of
trial
is
going
to
be
whether
there's
a
defect
solely
within
the
valve
unit
itself.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
cheng
shin
does
sell
to
some
tire
manufacturers,
yes.
it
also
sells
replacement
parts
that
are
stocked
directly
in
distributors'
warehouses,
such
as
the
hon
cycle
center
in
sacramento
county,
which
was
the
subject
of
one
of
our
inspections.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
the
tube
goes
inside
the
tire.
the
tube
is
not...
the
tube
and
the
tire
are
not
sold
as
one
unit.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
that's
true,
that's
true.
and
it
is
placed
on
the
rim
of
a
motorcycle,
and
then
there
is
a
tire
placed
on
top
of
the
tube.
and
the
tube
pokes
in
through
the
rim
and
that's
how
you
put
air
in
it,
just
like
on
your
bicycle.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
substantial
difference.
i
think
your
dealer
in
new
jersey
seeks
to
serve
a
certain
marketplace.
he's
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
stream
of
commerce,
if
you
will,
from
the
component
part
manufacturer
or
the
primary
manufacturer.
the
primary
manufacturer
relies,
depends
on
for
its
existence
service
of
a
much
wider
market.
it
doesn't
seek
to
serve
just
new
jersey
in
most
case.
we're
talking
about
somebody
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
somebody
who
has
to
serve
a
much
broader
marketplace
in
order
to
sell
a
lot
of
the
product.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
i
suppose
you
can
say
that
it's
foreseeable
that
anybody
who
has
any
kind
of
a
vehicle
could
end
up
in
any
state
of
the
union
and
perhaps
canada,
mexico,
or
someplace
else.
but
the
point
is
that
your
new
jersey
dealership
did
not
seek
to
serve
the
oklahoma
marketplace,
unless
you
find
that
there's
some
other
element.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
if
he's
doing
something
to
take
advantage
of
the
oklahoma
customers
and
getting
them
to
come
to
him--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--i
don't
think
that
you
can
say
that
the
new
jersey
automobile
dealer
sought
to
serve
the
oklahoma
marketplace
because
an
oklahoman
by
chance,
some
fortuity,
walks
into
his
dealership.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
it's
still
a
mere
fortuity.
he's
not...
the
dealer
is
not
seeking
to
serve
that
marketplace.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
and
the
dealership
is
not
systematically
again
and
again
seeking
to
serve
the
oklahoma
marketplace
in
your
analysis.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
that's
right,
they
couldn't
care
less.
they
just
happened
to
sell
valves
to
a
whole
bunch
of
manufacturers
of
tire
tubes
that
they
knew
serviced
this
marketplace.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
no,
no.
the
new
jersey
dealer
in
your
hypothetical
sells
one
automobile
to
somebody
who
happens
to
be
going
to
oklahoma.
in
this
hypothetical
or
in
this
case,
asahi
sells
over
a
million
valves
to
just
one
worldwide
producer
of
tire
tubes,
knowing
that
its
product
is
going
to
come
to
california,
and
it
sells...
in
ten
different
years,
it
sells
valves
to
cheng
shin.
it
is,
as
a
matter
of
a
distribution
system
it
is
indirectly
benefiting
from
what's
going
on
in
california.
now,
you're
never
going
to
get
a
case--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
that's
very
true.
but
i
think
vw
is
a
case
that
is
distinguishable
based
on
the
fact
that
we're
at
a
different
end
of
the
marketing
spectrum.
the
two
entities,
the
local
dealership
and
the
component
part
manufacturer,
have
to
serve,
seek
to
serve
different
marketplaces
as
a
matter
of
the
way
business
works.
you're
never
going
to
get
a
component
part
manufacturer
case
where
the
component
part
manufacturer
has
a
direct
sales
relationship
with
the
consumer,
because
the
component
part
manufacturer
makes
nothing
other
than
the
component
part
that
has
to
be
put
into
something
else
before
it
can
be
utilized.
therefore,
we're
in
a
position
where
the
component
part
manufacturer
can
be
insulated
by
the
nature
of
his
business
unless
he's
responsible
in
those
cases
where
there's
a
systematic
advantage
being
taken
of
a
marketplace
by
that
component
part
manufacturer.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
he
could
be
sued
in
japan.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
wherever
the
valve
happens
to
turn
up,
that's
california.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
not
wherever
it
turns
up.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i'm
suggesting
much
more.
i'm
suggesting
much
more
activity
being
required
of
the
component
part
manufacturer.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
mere
fortuity
that
one...
a
valve
could
end
up
on
your
car
from
new
jersey.
let's
say
that's
an
asahi
valve
and
it
happens
to
roll
into
oklahoma
or
california.
that's
a
fortuity.
but
where
you
have
a
manufacturer
of
a
component
part
who's
never
going
to
have
direct
contact
with
the
forum
because
he's
only
going
to
sell
to
other
manufacturers,
when
that
component
part
regularly
and
systematically,
because
of
the
known
distribution
system
of
the
primary
manufacturer,
ends
up
in
california
or
some
other
state,
that's
a
different
ballgame
than
the
one
isolated
instance.
i
would
submit
under
the
one
isolated
instance
jurisdiction
probably
is
not
appropriate.
that
would
be
consistent
with
volkwagen.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
yes.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
the
problem
again
that
i
have
is
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
a
component
part
manufacturer
who,
at
least
in
this
case,
does
all
of
its
business
in
japan,
which
means
to
me
that
if
in
those
cases
where
the
injured
party
perhaps
has
only
one
available
defendant,
the
valve
manufacturer,
that
that
plaintiff
may
have
to
go
to
japan
to
seek
any
redress
at
all.
now,
i
admit
that's
not
this
case.
we're
talking
indemnity.
the
plaintiff
has
settled
out.
the
defendants
didn't
have
to
settle
with
the
plaintiff,
by
the
way.
we
could
have
drug
the
plaintiff
through
all
of
this.
we
settled,
we're
seeking
our
indemnity,
and
i
think
california
has
a
substantial
interest
in
promoting
not
only
settlements,
but
also
promoting
the
indemnity
which
the
law
in
california
permits.
now,
in
footnote
one
of
the
petitioner's
brief
is
a
fairly
thorough
summary
of
what
the
nature
of
the
cross-complaint
is.
you'll
see
the
cross-complaint
is
an
equitable
cross-complaint
for
indemnity
or
apportionment,
as
allowed
by
california
law.
it
is
not
a
contractual
indemnity
cause
of
action.
the
state
of
california
has
a
substantial
interest
for
many
reasons:
the
accident
happened
there,
the
goods
were
bought
in
california,
california
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
safe
goods
come
into
the
state,
as
do
all
the
states
in
this
union.
there's
a
lot
of
those
that
are
very
obvious.
but
in
terms
of
fair
play
and
substantial
justice,
i
think
in
balancing
the
interest
of
the
state
versus
balancing
the
interest
of
asahi
weighs
favorably
in
that
of
the
state,
because
again
i
come
back
to
the
same
notion,
that
asahi
regularly
over
the
course
of
ten
years
and
over
the
course
of
five
years
sold
well
over
one
and
a
quarter
million
valves
to
cheng
shin
with
knowledge
of
its
distribution
system,
made
money
off
of
californians,
subjected
californians
to
the
potential
of
harm.
it's
the
legal
system
in
california
that
allows
asahi
to
do
the
business
that
it
does
there
indirectly,
and
i
don't
see
why
asahi
can't
come
to
california
and
defend
its
case.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
for
one
thing,
the
interest
that
california
has--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
that's
one
thing.
but
another
thing
is
the
transaction
took
place
in
california,
and
under
california
law...
cheng
shin,
by
the
way,
submitted
to
the
jurisdiction
of
california.
cheng
shin
is
entitled
to
the
benefits
and
the
burdens
of
california
law.
why
can't
cheng
shin,
if
it's
subject
to
those
benefits
and
burdens,
bring
its
indemnity
action
there
in
california,
where
the
main
action
was?
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
no,
there's
a
cheng
shin
u.s.a.
which
goes
out
and
sells
tubes
to
distributors,
and
then
cheng
shin
of
taiwan
sends
the
tubes
in
directly
to
the
distributors.
so
cheng
shin
u.s.a.
is
nothing
more
than
an
order
taker.
it's
a
separate
california
corporation.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
it
was
a
party
to
the
case.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
and
it's
still
out
there
and
has
a
cross-complaint
of
its
own.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
that's
actually
an
indemnity
claim.
but
actually,
cheng
shin
of
taiwan
was
the
one
that
settled,
because
cheng
shin
u.s.a.
was
in
an
indemnity
position
vis
a
vis
cheng
shin
of
taiwan.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
at
least
have
an
option
to
do
so,
yes.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
now,
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
retailer
of
the
tire,
of
the
tube
more
appropriately,
had
a
cross-action
against
asahi,
which
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time
because
of
some
technical
problems
in
terms
of
service
and
so
forth,
time
of
service
and
all
of
that.
but
it's
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
is
another
action
out
there
waiting
for
the
determination
of
this
court,
because
they
didn't
want
to
go
through
the
same
appellate
process
that
we
were
going
through.
so
there
is
an
interest
of
some
other
california
residents
out
there.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
and
i
think
you
probably
hit
the
nail
right
on
the
head
right
there,
because
if
you
have
a
producer
of
a
natural
metal
who
is
pulling
it
out
of
the
ground
and
sending
it
to
the
valve
manufacturer,
sending
it
to
asahi
for
whatever
purpose
asahi
wants
to
make
for
it
or
make
out
of
that
particular
metal,
that's
a
great
deal
different.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
your
steel
is
all
over
california,
and
you
know
that
your
steel
is
being
made
into
valve
stems.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
okay.
like
in
the
last
case,
valve
stem
headed
for
california.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
to
the
extent
that
a
metal
producer
is
subject
to
product
liability
law...
and
i'm
not
sure
that
steel
itself
constitutes
product
liability.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
bubbles
in
the
metal
or
it's
not
tempered
properly
or
whatever
the
process
is--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--yes.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
if
he
knows
it,
if
he's
taking
advantage
of
it
on
a
regular
basis,
if
he's
making
money
off
it
and
he
knows
and
he
continues
to
sell
and
he
doesn't
do
anything
to
protect
himself
from
suit
in
california.
i
don't
see
why
he
shouldn't
be
answerable
in
california.
he
has
the
same
opportunity
to
get
insurance
to
cover
him
here,
because
he
has
knowledge
that--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--never
say
never.
i
wouldn't
say
that.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
if
you--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--if
you
stick
your
head
in
the
sand,
you
can't
be
sued
where
you're
making
a
lot
of
money
from.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
right,
either.
i
think
where
as
a
matter
of
commercial
reality
your
producer
has
to
know
that
he
is
making
money
from
a
marketplace
on
a
regular,
systematic,
continued
basis,
i
don't
see
why
there
shouldn't
be
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
and
this
is
a
valve.
a
valve
is
a
valve.
it's
got
one
purpose,
is
to
be
a
valve,
nothing
more,
nothing
less.
now,
if
he's
got
a
valve
that's
manufactured
for
bicycles
and
is
wrongfully
put
in
a
motorcycle
tube,
that's
a
matter
of
liability
and
misuse.
however,
if
that
valve...
he's
sending
valves,
which
is
a
finished,
complete
product
that
cannot
be
used
for
anything
other
than
a
valve.
we're
not
talking
metal.
we're
talking
a
valve
is
a
valve,
and
it
can
only
go
into
a
tire
tube
and
it's
not
good
for
anything
else.
that's
the
case
we
have
here,
and
under
these
circumstances,
where
so
many
valves
are
in
question,
where
so
many
valves
were
actually
found
in
california...
i
want
to
break
the
train
of
thought
for
just
a
second
here.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
made
that
some
lawyer
found
some
valve
stems
that
he
identified
as
asahi,
and
the
implication
obviously
is
he
doesn't
know
an
asahi
valve
from
some
other
valve.
the
declaration
from
wally
chen,
who
is
the
person
from
cheng
shin,
is
offered
as
exhibit
a
to
the
respondent's
brief,
and
in
that
appendix
it
specifically
stated
that
asahi's
logo
is
a
capital
mr.
shepard,
my
partner.
as
indicated
in
appendix
b
and
c,
that's
how
he
identified
those
valves.
there
has
never
been
any
denial
in
any
affidavit
submitted
on
the
record
that
the
logo
is
not
a
capital
"a"
that
is
totally
encircled.
there
has
never
been
any
kind
of
an
affidavit
that
the
identification
was
somehow
wrong
based
on
the
affidavit
of
mr.
shepard.
so
we
know
that
there
is
267
of
those
valves
in
california
in
1983.
this
accident
happened
in
1978.
what
i'm
proposing
to
the
court
is
that
the
continued
systematic
taking
advantage
of
cheng
shin's
system
of
distribution--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--i
believe
the
affidavit
of
asahi's
president
said
that
they
had
done
business
with
cheng
shin
over
a
ten
year
period.
and
there
is
also
a
declaration--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--well,
they
didn't
say
that.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
the
evidence
is
that
they,
number
one,
knew
or
at
the
very
least
should
have
known
that
cheng
shin,
honda,
and
others
regularly
serve
this
market.
they're
an
important
cog--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--no,
i'm
saying
the
declarations
say
that
they
knew
that
cheng
shin
did.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
i'm
also
saying
that
it
would
be
unrealistic
to
expect
that
they
didn't.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
no,
i
don't
know
that.
i
don't
know
that.
as
i
was
going
to
point
out,
however,
the
sampling
that
we
did
in
northern
california
shows
that
approximately
25
percent
of
the
valves--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--there
is
specific
language
in
the
california
supreme
court
decision
at
at
least
three
places--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--yes,
that
there
was
an
awareness.
asahi
was
aware
of
the
distribution
system's
operation
and
knew
that
it
would
benefit
economically
from
the
sale
in
california
of
products
incorporating
its
components.
that's
page
c11
of
the
appendix.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
i
can't
tell
you
what
the
percentage
of
tire
tubes
were
that
came
into
california.
i
just
don't
have
a
record
of
that.
what
i
can--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--the
year
that's
most
critical--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--'78,
we
do
know
that
there
were
100,000
valves
sold
to
cheng
shin
in
that
year.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
cheng
shin
might
very
well
know.
that's
something
that
i
just
didn't
get
the
declaration
on.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
well,
they
may
very
well
know.
they
may
know
that
a
certain
percentage
of
their
tire
tubes
contained
cheng
shin--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--they
might
not
know
that,
i
can't
deny
that.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
i
beg
your
pardon?
no,
i
don't
have
those
figures.
i
just
don't
have
them.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
it's
true,
it's
my
burden,
it's
my
burden.
i
can't
offer
you
that,
but
i
can
offer
you
what
was
actually
there
in
'83.
and
what
i
was
going
to
say
a
minute
ago
is
that,
whether
or
not
this
accident
or
this
valve
came
into
california
at
the
beginning
of
the
time
of
this
systematic
distribution
of
the
product
or
at
the
end
of
it
shouldn't
matter.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
we
wanted
to
establish
that
they
were
in
fact
in
california.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
the
only
thing
i
would
ask
is
that
the
court
take
cognizance
of
the
cases
below,
all
of
which
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
which
point
out
the
significance
of
awareness
of
distribution
systems
and
consider
those
facts
in
coming
to
your
decision.
in
closing,
i
can
only
say
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
appropriate,
where
in
fact
the
component
part
manufacturer
who
is
in
a
unique
position
can
insulate
itself
from
having
to
appear
within
the
forum
simply
because
it
will
never
have
contact
directly
with
the
forum.
a
component
part
manufacturer
is
in
a
unique
position.
it
makes
all
of
its
sales
some
place
else.
it's
never
going
to
be
selling
directly
to
the
consumer.
and
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
devise
a
way
or
certain
circumstances
under
which
those
people
can
be
held
accountable
for
the
safety
of
their
products
in
our
state
and
in
all
the
states.
and
i
would
suggest--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--no,
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
but
where
that
company
manufactures
those
airplanes
knowing
that
they're
going
to
be
coming
here,
it's
a
different
ballgame.
that's
a
different
set
of
circumstances,
and
if
you've
got--
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
not
that
alone.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
there
has
to
be
more.
mr.
ronald
r.
haven
there
has
to
be
purposeful
availment,
are
the
key
words
i
believe,
of
the
benefits
and
protections
of
the
laws
of
the
state.
and
i
am
submitting
that
awareness
and
continued,
the
continued
taking
advantage,
the
continued
selling
of
these
valves
to
asahi,
with
the
awareness
that
they
were
coming
into
the
state,
which
is
i
think
what
the
declaration
says,
i
submit
that
that
is
purposeful
availment
within
the
meaning
of
due
process.
