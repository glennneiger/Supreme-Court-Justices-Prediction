unknown
speaker
how
many
tires
did
they
make?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
have
been
only
half
of
one
percent.
unknown
speaker
it
might
be
a
lot
of
valves,
but
it
certainly
reduces
the
chance
that
any
of
those
valves
got
to
the
united
states,
especially
when
only
20
percent
of
the
business
of
cheng
shin
came
from
california.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
anybody
know
that
any
of--
unknown
speaker
--the
odds
are
even
against
it.
unknown
speaker
the
odds
are
against
it,
just
on
the
figures.
unknown
speaker
maybe
ten.
unknown
speaker
nevertheless,
in
terms
of
whether
asahi
should
have
anticipated
that
its
products
were
regularly
going
to
arrive
in
california,
that's
a
different
question.
unknown
speaker
to
sell.
unknown
speaker
does
cheng
sing,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
cheng
shin,
sell
its
tires
in
the
united
states
to
motorcycle
manufacturers,
or
does
it
put
them
directly
on
the
tire
market?
unknown
speaker
these
are
tubes
that
go
inside
of
tires?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
does
cheng
shin...
does
it
sell
to
tire
manufacturers?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
valve
to
tube
to
tire
to
motorcycle?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
tube
is
manufactured
separately
from
the
tire.
unknown
speaker
now,
how
is
this
foreseeability
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
awareness
of
the
possibility,
any
different
in
kind
from
the
awareness
that
the
seller,
that
an
automobile
dealer
has
when
he
sells
automobiles
in
new
jersey
that
they
are
very
likely
to
be
driven
in
oklahoma?
unknown
speaker
the
equivalent
of
the
person
serving
the
marketplace
is
the
person
who
buys
the
volkswagen
in
new
jersey,
and
i
know
i'm
selling
these
cars
to
people
who
travel
and
i
know
that
they're
going
to
travel,
among
other
places,
to
oklahoma.
yet
we've
held
that
oklahoma
can't
base
its
jurisdiction
over
the
new
jersey
company
simply
on
the
ground
that
somebody
who
bought
a
volkswagen
in
new
jersey
travels
in
oklahoma
with
it.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
volkswagen
should
have
come
out
the
same
even
if
the
seller
of
the
vehicle
had
said,
oh,
you
want
a
new
car,
where
are
you
going?
i'm
going
to
oklahoma.
have
a
good
trip.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
this
is
just
a
new
jersey
customer
of
his
that
says
he's
going
to
go
visit
his
daughter
in
oklahoma.
but
that
nevertheless,
it
still
leaves
a
new
jersey
fellow
who
is
not
seeking
to
serve
the
oklahoma
market.
unknown
speaker
or
some
new
jersey
person
buys
the
car
and
says,
i'm
going
to
oklahoma.
unknown
speaker
well,
nor
was
asahi
here.
asahi
couldn't
have
cared
less
where
these
valves
went.
it
happened
to
know
that
it
was
very
likely
they
were
going
to
go
to
california,
but
they
couldn't
care
less
where
they
went
once
they
unloaded
them
and
got
the
money
for
them.
they
weren't
seeking
to
serve
california
any
more
than
the
volkswagen
dealer
could
have
cared
less
where
the
person
was
driving
his
volkswagen.
he
knew
he
was
going
to
probably
go
to
oklahoma.
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
white
just
gave
you,
the
fellow
says:
i
am
going
to
go
to
oklahoma.
the
dealer
says:
well,
good
luck.
you're
right,
he
doesn't
care
whether
he
goes
to
oklahoma
or
not.
so
he's
not
trying
to
serve
the
oklahoma
market.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
the
same
here.
unknown
speaker
asahi
was
not
seeking
to
serve
california,
either.
it
was
just
selling
valves.
it
couldn't
care
less
where
the
valves
went.
unknown
speaker
just
the
way
the
volkswagen
dealer
knew
that
these
people
were
going
to
be
driving
the
car
in
oklahoma.
unknown
speaker
even
in
vw,
some
of
us
were
in
dissent.
unknown
speaker
i
say
even
in
vw,
some
of
us
were
in
dissent.
unknown
speaker
he's
not
insulated.
he's
just
not
able
to
be
sued
everywhere
in
the
world
where
his
component
parts
go.
he's
liable.
he
can
be
sued
where
he
can
be
found.
unknown
speaker
we're
not
talking
about
not
being
able
to
obtain
redress
against
the
person
who
makes
a
defective
valve.
it's
just
a
question
of
where
you
can
obtain
it,
whether
you
can
obtain
it
wherever
the
valve
happens
to
turn
up
or
whether
you
have
to
go
to
some
place
where
he
is
located
to
sue.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you're
saying,
wherever
the
valve
turns
up.
unknown
speaker
mr.
haven,
you're
going
to
get
to
the
second
prong
of
the
argument,
aren't
you,
having
to
do
with
fair
play?
unknown
speaker
in
light
of
the
fact
that
what's
left
in
this
case
are
two
foreign
corporations,
really
foreign
corporations,
the
california
residents,
the
original
plaintiffs,
are
out?
unknown
speaker
but
what
interest
of
california
remains
now
that
the
original
plaintiffs
have
settled?
unknown
speaker
possible
future
injuries?
unknown
speaker
possible
future
injuries?
unknown
speaker
this
is
cheng
shin
the
american
subsidiary
of
the
taiwanese
company?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
wasn't
it
a
party
to
the
case?
unknown
speaker
and
i
assume--
unknown
speaker
--i
assume...
and
i
don't
know
what
the
facts
are
in
this
particular
case.
i
assume
in
the
typical
situation
here
your
american
company
probably
has
an
american
insurance
carrier
who
probably
settled
with
the
plaintiff
and
has
a
subrogation
claim
against
the
manufacturer.
unknown
speaker
normally
that
company...
normally
we'd
really
have
an
insurance
company
that
would
have
an
interest
in
this.
unknown
speaker
this
particular
juncture
in
this
litigation.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
you're
right
that
an
indemnity
claim
such
as
cheng
shin's
is
always
going
to
be
able
to
bring
in
a
person
further
back
in
the
stream,
presumably
asahi
could
make
the
same
argument,
if
we
sustain
you
here,
if
it
wants
to
file
an
indemnity
action
against
the
steel
manufacturer
somewhere
in
hong
kong
from
whom
it
bought
the
steel.
somewhere
the
chain
has
got
to
get
too
thin.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
different
is
it?
i
mean,
this
person
just
sends
steel
bars
from
hong
kong
to
japan,
and
the
same
conversations
took
place.
asahi
tells
him:
yes,
we
send
a
lot
of
our
stuff
to
cheng
shin
and
cheng
shin
sends
a
certain
amount
to
the
united
states.
and
do
you
know
that
your
steel
is
all
over
california.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
if
you
don't
know,
we're
telling
you.
unknown
speaker
and
it
cracks.
and
last
week
what
really
failed
in
an
accident
was
your
steel.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
yes,
he
should
be
suable--
unknown
speaker
--in
california?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
never
too
far,
it
is
never
too
remote?
unknown
speaker
just
never
find
out
where
the
person
you're
selling
something
to
intends
to
resell
it.
i
mean,
that's
all
he
has
to
do
to
protect
himself,
right?
unknown
speaker
ask
not
where
your
valves
go.
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
the
seller
of
the
finished
product,
he
will
always
know
where
his
products
are
going.
unknown
speaker
what
evidence
is
there
of
continuous
taking
advantage
of
california?
unknown
speaker
what
about,
what's
the
evidence
that
asahi
consciously
was
taking
advantage
of
the
california
market
over
a
period
of
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
evidence
is
there?
unknown
speaker
isn't
know
enough?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that.
unknown
speaker
we're
back
to
where
we
were
a
while
ago,
that
there
is
still
the
missing
component
of
how...
what
percentage
of
cheng
shin's
tubes
contained
asahi's
valves.
you
don't
know
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't
there
a
finding...
was
there
a
finding
below
that
asahi
over
a
course
of
years
was
consciously
taking
advantage
of
the
california
market?
unknown
speaker
that
that's
the
case,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
if
any
of
them
were
sold
there.
that's
a
very
general
statement.
i
mean,
obviously
they
knew
they
would
benefit
from
the
sale
of
products
containing
their
components
anywhere,
including
california.
but
that
does
not
say
to
what
extent
it
thought
they
were
being
sold
or
knew
they
were
being
sold
in
california.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
cheng
shin
have
know
how
many
asahi
valves
were
sold
and
distributed
in
california
in
the
year
1978?
why
wouldn't
they
have
put
an
affidavit
in
the
record
for
the
year
that
is
most
critical
here?
unknown
speaker
or
'77,
whatever
you
want.
unknown
speaker
but
how
many
of
those
came
to
california?
cheng
shin
ought
to
know.
unknown
speaker
they
probably
don't
know,
that's
the
point.
unknown
speaker
right.
and
they
know
how
many
tubes
went
to
california.
but
they
don't
know
how
many
tubes...
they
might
not
know
how
many
tubes
went
to
california
containing
asahi
valves.
unknown
speaker
but
they
ought
to
know
what
the
percentage.
first
of
all,
they
ought
to
know
the
percentage,
and
if
you
just
extrapolate
you
ought...
but
they
didn't
give
us
those
figures,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
so
the
burden
really
is
en
you
to
sustain
jurisdiction.
so
it's
a
hole
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
it
just
seems
to
me
it's
such
a
strange
way
to
get
this
evidence,
to
have
your
partner
going
out
looking
through
a
bunch
of
valve
assemblies
five
years
later.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
can
always
happen
with
somebody
that
doesn't
know
that
it's
going
to
be
brought
in.
i
mean,
you
can
have
somebody
who
is
negligent
as
can
be
in
the
manufacture
of
something
more
dangerous
than
a
valve,
let's
say
an
airplane,
okay,
and
he
doesn't
know
that
the
airplane's
going
to
be
used
in
the
united
states,
and
he
sells
it
to
someone
who
then
brings
it
to
the
united
states
and
it's
used
here.
now,
it's
very
easy
for
that
to
hurt
somebody
in
the
united
states,
and
you
wouldn't
assert
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
manufactured
the
product
that
was
used
here
is
enough
to
enable
him
to
be
sued
here,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
it
isn't
the
fact
that
the
injury
occurred
here
alone
that
makes
it
an
appealing
case.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
the
fact
that
the
injury
from
the
defective
product
occurred
here,
it
is
not
that
fact
that
makes
it
an
appealing
case
for
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
there
has
to
be
some
voluntary--
unknown
speaker
--submission
to
the
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
