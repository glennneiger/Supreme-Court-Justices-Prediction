mr.
graydon
s.
staring
"starring".
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i'm
not
sure
how
they
got
there.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
narrowly
viewed,
this
case
arises
from
a
dispute
over
a
supply
contract
between
two
foreigners
abroad.
a
different
and
broader
view
was
taken
of
the
case
by
the
respondent
and
by
the
california
supreme
court,
as
a
case
affecting
the
potential
tort
and
indemnity
claims
of
californians.
even
if
this
court
were
to
decide
the
case
upon
the
narrowest
of
grounds,
we
think
it
could
not
very
well
ignore
the
implications
which
the
case
might
have
for
the
tort
suits
of
injured
parties
in
america.
i
therefore
do
not
address
the
case
with
the
intent
to
neglect
that
broader
issue,
but
instead
would
propose
to
address
it
on
that
issue,
rather
than
the
narrower
one.
both
parties
here
start
with
world-wide
volkswagen.
that
case,
as
you
well
know,
is
an
interstate
case
rather
than
a
case
involving
an
international
relationship
or
a
foreign
defendant.
i
think
that
members
of
this
court
have
not
been
completely
at
ease
with
the
emphasis
upon
the
concept
and
term
"sovereignty"
in
the
analysis
of
the
problem
in
world-wide
volkswagen.
that
analysis
can
probably
be
validly
taken
as
a
reverse
view
of
the
individual
rights
which
are
intended
to
be
preserved
by
the
due
process
clause,
and
indeed
i
have
seen
that
view
taken.
here
in
this
case,
however,
by
contrast
with
world-wide
volkswagen,
we
have
an
attempted
projection
of
state
power
internationally.
we
have,
i
think,
therefore
an
authentic
case
for
analysis
in
the
traditional
terms
of
sovereignty,
as
we
are
dealing
not
only
with
an
express
clause
of
the
constitution,
albeit
a
terse
one,
but
with
the
problem
of
considering
standards
of
international
law
and
comity.
perhaps
the
conclusion
that
we
urge
here
could
be
reached
on
the
basis
of
such
international
standards
and
without
reference
to
the
due
process
clause.
we
don't
urge
that.
we
see
no
need
to,
and
we
don't
think
it's
desirable.
questions
which
arise
domestically
and
questions
of
personal
jurisdiction
which
arise
internationally
should,
if
possible,
be
resolved
with
similar
analyses.
these
analyses
in
our
view
would
be
inconsistent
only
in
respect
of
the
element
of
this
court's
power
to
control
reception
and
enforcement
within
the
united
states
and
this
court's
function
of
distributing
to
some
extent
the
judicial
business
within
an
interstate
federal
system.
and
of
course,
therefore,
in
the
international
case
it
would
be
necessary,
we
think,
to
take
account
of
the
lack
of
that
power
and
the
lack
of
that
function
in
the
international
sphere,
and
in
that
sphere
to
give
some
heed
to
the
views
of
others
abroad
in
connection
with
our
international
powers.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
there
are
none
in
this
case,
but
there
are
other
cross-claims
in
other
cases
not
before
the
court,
not
this
identical
case.
they
exist.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes,
they
arise
from
this
accident.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
we
have
no
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
the
record
shows
nothing
as
to
it.
we
are
not
suggesting,
by
the
way,
that
this
court
in
this
case
should
announce
a
rule
of
international
law
or
a
standard
of
international
conduct.
that
would
be
uncalled
for.
it
is,
i
suppose,
a
proposal
of
that
nature
which
the
respondent
suggests
in
urging
the
affirmance
below
at
one
point
in
its
brief.
what
we
do
say
is
that
international
considerations
call
for
a
heightened
scrutiny
of
the
necessary
contacts,
ties,
or
relations
to
establish
personal
jurisdiction,
and
we
do
urge
that
a
case
of
this
character
is
not
one
in
which
the
scope
of
the
jurisdiction
of
our
state
courts
over
manufacturers
abroad
should
be
extended.
we
would
not
even
urge
that
there
should
be
such
an
extension
if
our
client
were
a
domestic
manufacturer
of
components,
but
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
it
is
a
foreign,
an
alien
manufacturer,
and
we
think
this
is
not...
such
a
case
is
not
a
case
for
an
extension
such
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
given
to
world-wide
volkswagen.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes.
yes,
i
don't
see
why
not.
may
i
add,
justice
blackmunn,
that
the
original
plaintiff
did
not
sue
my
client
asahi
here.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
but
had
it
done
so,
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
i
did
not
wish
to
take
refuge
solely
in
the
narrow
view,
in
the
narrow
issue
in
this
case
raised
by
the
fact
that
it
pertains
to
a
contract
between
two
parties
in
the
far
east.
i
do
not
waive
that
issue,
but
i
think
the
broader
issue
has
to
be
seen
by
the
court.
the
focus
of
attention
under
world-wide
volkswagen
in
this
case
has
been
on
the
stream
of
commerce
doctrine.
we
don't
know
where
the
headwaters
of
that
stream
are
and
we
have
no
map
to
show
us.
but
we
assume
for
our
purposes
here
that
asahi
delivered
products
into
that
stream
or
some
tributary
of
it.
we
don't
accept,
however,
the
respondent's
further
suggestion,
that
a
component
maker
in
the
position
of
asahi
here
is
somehow
or
other
especially
responsible
for
that
stream,
as
though
it
were
the
original
spring.
that
is
an
unrealistic
view,
we
suggest,
both
commercially
and
legally.
this
court
in
referring
to
the
significance
of
delivering
products
into
the
stream
of
commerce
in
world-wide
volkswagen
added,
however,
the
important
qualification
that
they
must
be
so
delivered
with
the
expectation
that
they
would
be
sold
to
consumers
in
the
forum
state.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
foreseeability
or
mere
foreseeability
of
their
reaching
the
forum
state
was
not
enough.
the
supreme
court
of
california
chose
to
deal
with
the
case
not
in
terms
of
foreseeability,
the
term
"foreseeability"
which
this
court
had
used,
but
rather
in
terms
of
awareness,
and
there
has
been
some
argument
in
the
briefs
about
the
difference
between
the
two.
i
would
not
bandy
words
here
about
foreseeability
and
awareness,
but
would
suggest
instead
that
at
this
point
we
look
at
the
evidence,
the
very
brief,
the
very
simple
evidence
in
the
record,
which
was
found
sufficient
below
to
sustain
jurisdiction
in
california,
because
it
illustrates
a
problem
which
is
inherent
in
cases
which
will
arise
under
the
standard
which
the
california
supreme
court
has
adopted.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
no,
i
do
not
concede
that
it
was
foreseeable.
the
evidence
on
it--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--yes,
we
argue
that
foreseeability
alone
is
not
enough.
and
let
me
retract
that.
i
think
that
we're
prepared
to
argue
this
case
and
present
this
case
to
the
court
in
terms
of
foreseeability,
mere
foreseeability.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
no,
but
that
that
should
not
be
the
test
and
that
that
is
the
very
most,
the
very
most
which
could
be
shown
by
the
record
here.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
don't
ask
this
court
to
review
the
facts
as
found
by
the
california
court.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
on
whatever
record.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
don't
know
whether
they
found
it.
they
found
something
that
i
think
was
at
least
that.
and
as
i
say,
i
don't
want
to
bandy
words
about
what
awareness
is
and
foreseeability.
they
went
pretty
far
with
the
thin
record
they
had.
i
want
to
go
into
that
record,
though,
for
a
special
reason.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
do
not
think
that
there's
any
different
principle
which
applies.
i
think
the
principles
which
this
court
has
laid
down
apply
to
both.
we
think,
however,
that
the
situation
of
component
manufacturers
is
likely
in
most
instances
to
be
very
different,
and
that
it
is
possible
therefore
to
frame
a
test
with
respect
to
component
manufacturers
which
is
consistent
with
the
same
principles
applying
to
everyone
else,
and
we
have
tried
to
do
that
in
our
brief.
the
record
here
was
very
short
so
far
as
knowledge
or
awareness
or
foreseeability
was
concerned.
there
is
an
affidavit
which
shows
some
conversations,
unspecified.
some
time
in
those
conversations,
information
was
given
to
asahi
that
cheng
shin
sold
tubes
worldwide
and
that
some
unspecified
number
or
type
were
sold
in
the
united
states.
that's
it.
now,
asahi's
knowledge
of
those
meager
facts
is
absolutely
undated
in
reference
to
contract,
production,
delivery,
or
even
the
accident
in
this
case,
which
occurred
in
1978,
the
first
year
of
six
years
in
which
the
plaintiff
cheng
shin
collected
statistics
to
use
against
asahi
in
this
case.
now,
that
shows,
we
think,
what
kind
of
murk,
what
kind
of
fog,
we
are
likely
to
get
into
in
component
cases
under
the
standard
which
has
been
followed
by
the
california
supreme
court.
we
could,
i
suppose,
have
had
a
battle
of
affidavits,
which
could
have
been
two
or
three
or
more
affidavits.
we
have
one
affidavit
full
of
fog.
we
could
have
had
several
foggy
affidavits.
and
if
you
think
about
the
distinction
between
the
component
manufacturer's
situation
and
the
situation
of
the
ultimate
manufacturer
and
exporter,
you
will
see
how
likely
this
area
is
to
be
foggy
all
the
time.
in
the
case
of
the
ultimate
manufacturer--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--i
wouldn't
draw
the
distinction
just
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
was
an
ultimate
manufacturer
or
an
exporter.
i
think
the
critical
thing
is
that,
whichever
one
it
is,
it
seek
to
serve
the
california
market,
as
was
said
in
world-wide
volkswagen,
that
there
be
some
act,
some
act
by
which
it
positively
seeks
to
serve
that
market
and
direct
its
products
into
that
market.
and
so
it
will
depend
upon
the
facts
in
every
case.
but
i
would
say
that
if
a
manufacturer
had
nothing
more
to
go
on
than
a
bit
of
conversation,
of
undocumented
conversation,
that
an
exporter
sent
products
to
the
united
states
as
well
as
other
places,
that
is
not
the
kind
of
activity
of
direction
toward
the
california
market
which
we
think
this
court
intended
in
world-wide
volkswagen
and
which
is
consistent
at
least
with
other
decisions
of
the
court.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
no,
justice
scalia,
i
do
not
contend
that.
i
do
say,
though,
that
you
must
at
least
do
some
act
by
which
you
encourage
the
sending
of
it
there,
by
which
you
seek
to
serve
that
market.
you
must
do
something
more
than
respond
to
an
order
which
is
unspecific
as
to
where
the
product
is
going
to
go.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
must
beg
off
any
response
on
criminal
law.
but
i
would
have
thought
that
to
be
an
accessory
under
the
criminal
law
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
more
knowledge,
more
scienter
than
that.
i
don't
know.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
cheng
shin.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
it
does
not
show
it.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
that's
right.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
that's
right.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
exactly.
that
is
exactly
the
situation.
we
don't
know
from
the
record
what
portion
of
valves
were
bought
from
us
and
what
portion
were
bought
from--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--we
don't
know
that
from
this
record,
no.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
tires,
i
think.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
no,
we
don't
know
the
number
of
valves.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
no,
because
the
component
manufacturer
puts
his
valves
in
inventory,
he
ships
them
to
the
ultimate
manufacturer,
they
go
through
his
inventory.
at
some
time
or
other,
he
takes
them
out
and
sends
them
on.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
think
that
the
realistic
situation
in
an
industrial
situation
of
this
sort
is
a
little
different,
and
that
there
are
more
likely
to
be
supply
contracts
and
shipments
from
one
country
to
another
under
supply
contracts,
rather
than
door
to
door
salesmen.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
the
record
contains
affidavits
in
which
a
lawyer
in
sacramento
has
said
that
he
identified
quite
a
number
of
our
valves
on
tires
in
california.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes,
we
think
so.
we
think
this
is
really
to
be
disregarded.
and
we
don't
think
that,
incidentally,
that
the
lower
court
or
that
the
california
supreme
court
indicated
any
great
reliance
upon
that.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
the
record
shows
that
valves
identified
as
ours
have
been
found
in
the
state
of
california
in
the
year
1983.
i
believe
that's
the
year
in
which
they're
said
to
have
been
found.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
that's
right,
1983.
this
accident
happened
in
1978,
and
we
are
talking,
i
hope,
about
contemporaneous
knowledge
when
we
seek
to
impose
jurisdiction
upon
someone
for--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--well,
that
is
not,
however,
at
the
heart
of
the
stream
of
commerce
doctrine
as
we
understand
it.
we
don't
deal
here
with
any
question
of
general
jurisdiction
over
asahi
in
california,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
contention
that
anyone
even
would
dare
to
contend
that
the
presence
of
some
asahi
valves
in
california
would
constitute
asahi's
presence
there.
so
it's
necessary
here
for
cheng
shin
to
prevail,
if
it
does
at
all,
on
the
stream
of
commerce
doctrine,
and
that
involves--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--the
record
shows
that
we
were
told
that
at
some
time.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
it
must
be
taken...
yes,
it
must
be
taken
that
we
had
a
mere...
an
awareness
of
a
mere
likelihood,
and
that
is
all,
a
mere
likelihood
at
most
that
some
valve
of
ours
might
find
its
way
to
california.
and
the
statistics
gathered
afterward
show
that
on
the
probability
basis
it
was
unlikely,
rather
than
likely.
we
have
no
more
than
that.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
well,
the
evidence
of
that--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--there
was
an
affidavit
showing,
as
i
said,
that
in
1983--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--there
were
a
number
of
valves
found
which
were
identified
as
asahi's,
tentatively
by
the
way.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
because
this
is,
again,
one
of
the
vices
inherent
in
this
sort
of
thing,
that
it
is
still
disputed
whether
the
valve
in
this
case
was
ever
made
by
asahi.
asahi
has
now
inspected
the
valve
and
says,
no,
it's
not
ours.
so
we
have
yet
to
get,
presumably,
to
some
point
in
a
trial
where
it
may
finally
be
established
whether
the
component
was
or
wasn't
made
by
the
component
maker.
and
then
perhaps
if
the
answer
is
no
we
can
get
out
on
a
lack
of
jurisdiction.
i
don't
know.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
agree
with
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
and
this
really
heightens
the
injustice
of
it,
that
jurisdiction
should
be
established
on
such
a
thin
premise.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
and
we
did
not
do
it.
we
did
not
do
it,
and
i
repeat
that
i
think
what
the
record
here
shows
is
the
inherent
fogginess
of
this
kind
of
case.
we
would
have
gotten
simply
more
vague
and
speculative
indications.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
no,
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
you're
correct.
but
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
limitations
upon
one
executive
in
an
affidavit
which,
if
it's
to
serve
any
purpose,
has
to
be
inherently
negative.
someone
comes
in
and
says:
over
the
lunch
table,
i
told
these
people
once
this.
and
what
do
we
do?
we
come
back
and
say,
i
never
heard
it,
i
don't
remember
it,
i
don't
remember
this
incidental
fact?
if
the...
when
we
turn
by
contrast
to
the
case
of
the
primary
manufacturer
and
shipper
and
to
cases
where
jurisdiction
has
been
found
in
the
past,
we
find
objective...
we're
going
to
find
objective
acts,
objective
documented
transactions.
we're
not
going
to
find
this
kind
of
foggy
situation.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
think
there
would
not,
justice
stevens.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
if
you
have
that
situation,
yes.
but
i
don't
think
there
would
be
jurisdiction,
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--if
i
may
repeat
it
to
be
sure
i
understand
it,
this
is
that
we
have
knowledge
we
supply
all
the
valves
to
cheng
shin--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--and
we
have
knowledge
that
they
ship
their
tires
with
our
valves
into
california.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
all
right.
i
will
say
that
in
that
case
we
have
certainly
foreseeability
and
we
have
more
than
mere
foreseeability.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
but
there
is
another...
i
do
not
concede
there
is
jurisdiction
because
we
have
to
look
at
other
possibilities.
suppose
that
all
we
do
is
to
supply
valves
which
are
in
accordance
with
the
specifications
which
are
given
us.
it
is
not
realistic,
it
is
not
reasonable,
it
is
not
consistent
with
international
shoe,
it
is
not
fair
play
and
substantial
justice,
to
require
everyone
who
supplies
a
part
abroad
in
response
to
an
order
or
specifications
to
make
inquiries
and
to
attach
the
ultimate
legal
and
jurisdictional
significance
to
the
possibilities
of
where
those
parts
may
go.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
the
difficulty
as
a
practical
matter
with
that,
justice
stevens,
is
that
you
don't
know
what
the
ultimate
manufacturer
is
going
to
do
or
how
he's
going
to
do
it,
what
products
he's
going
to
put
it
into
and
what
products
he's
going
to
say
it
should
be
used
on,
a
bicycle
or
a
high
speed
motorcycle.
you
are
very
far
out
of
control
of
all
of
those
things.
if
i
have
a
minute,
i
should
like
to
say
that
i
submit
that
this
situation
of
asahi
does
not
conform
to
that
fair
play
and
substantial
justice
which
this
court
has
said
is
the
principal
guideline
in
cases
of
this
sort.
thank
you.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
just
a
few
seconds
of
it,
if
i
may
make
one
final
observation.
and
that
is
that
the
doctrine
laid
down
by
the
california
supreme
court
and
urged
of
course
by
the
respondent
here
is
one
which
places
cheng
shin
or
any
manufacturer
similarly
situated
in
complete
control
of
the
question
of
jurisdiction
over
the
component
maker,
according
to
whether
it
discloses
or
doesn't
disclose
some
seemingly
incidental
fact.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
predictability
which
this
court
has
held
is
supposed
to
be
preserved
by
the
due
process
clause.
thank
you
very
much.
