justice
john
paul
stevens
we
do
know
there
were
quite
a
few,
don't
we?
we
do
know
it
was
something
like
a
quarter
of
a
million
that
were
sold
in
california?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
didn't
they
all
have
your
client's
valves?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
your
client
know
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
must
have
some
idea
what's
going
to
happen
to
those.
i
mean,
you
have
salesmen
who
talk
to
your
customers,
i
suppose,
and
they
find
out
what
their
needs
are
and
what
kind
of
products
they
need,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
find
the
registered
agent
today
you
could
serve
him
today,
couldn't
you?
i
mean,
for
personal
jurisdiction
isn't
it
your
presence
at
the
time
you're
sued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unlikely?
i
thought
the
evidence
was
there
were
500,000
of
your
valves
that
were
sold
by
asahi
to
cheng
shin
in
one
year.
and
you
think
it's
unlikely
that
any
of
those
went
to
the
united
states
when
you
know
they're
doing
business
in
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
there
a
sampling
of
one
county
and
about
half
of
the
valves
there
came
from
your
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
staring,
isn't
the
fogginess
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
affidavit
of
asahi's
president
is
perhaps
not
as
detailed
as
it
might
have
been?
couldn't
he
have
spelled
out
in
detail
just
how
much
knowledge
they
had
of
the
ultimate
destination
of
these
valves?
and
didn't
do
that.
he
just
said
he
knew
he
sent
some
to
taiwan,
and
he
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
he
knew
was
going
to
happen
later.
isn't
that
right,
or
maybe
i'm
misstating
the
affidavit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
as
a
legal
matter,
supposing
your
opponent
took
the
president's
deposition
and
said:
mr.
president,
what
do
you
know
about
the
distribution
of
your
products
in
the
united
states?
and
he
said:
well,
we
don't
ship
anything
directly
to
the
united
states;
we
send
everything
to
taiwan;
we
do
understand
that
they
send
about
100,000
or
200,000
or
a
million
dollars
worth
of
our
product
into
california.
that's
purely
at
their
decision,
but
we
do
know
that
happens.
would
there
be
jurisdiction
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
doesn't
have
to
be
fogginess.
you
have
a
real
cleancut
position
if
you
want
to
make
it.
you're
not
arguing
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
that's
a
defense
on
the
merits,
that
you
just
did
exactly
perform
your
contract.
but
supposing
you
knew
they
filled
the
specifications,
you
also
knew
that
they
were
going
to
explode
as
soon
as
they
were
put
in
motion
on
a
motorcycle,
or
there
were
fireworks
or
something.
would
you
still
say
no
jurisdiction
at
all?
