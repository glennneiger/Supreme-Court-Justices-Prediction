do
you
pronounce
your
name
"stare-ing"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
"starring",
okay.
they
have
two
dots
over
the
"a"
and
i
wasn't
sure
just
how
that
figured
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
see
where
you'd
get
out
on
a
lack
of
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
supposing
i
sued
the
ford
motor
company
in
california
and
i
said,
this
car
that
you
made
for
me
is
really
loused
up,
and
their
answer
is,
well,
it's
not
a
ford.
well,
it
may
turn
out
not
to
be
a
ford,
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
california
courts
didn't
have
jurisdiction
over
ford.
it
means
i
lose
the
case
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
have
a
right
to
test...
supposing
you
think
this
affidavit
is
foggy
or
you
think
it
doesn't
say
as
much
as
you
think
it
ought
to.
you
have
a
right
to
take
that
person's
deposition,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
you
choose
to
avail
yourself
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
staring.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
haven.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
haven.
mr.
staring,
you
have
one
minute
left.
do
you
wish
to
use
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
staring.

case
is
submitted.
