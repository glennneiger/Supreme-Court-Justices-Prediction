justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
record
show
what
percentage
of
cheng
shin's...
is
that
the
name,
cheng
shin?
justice
byron
r.
white
cheng
shin's
valves
are
purchased
from
your
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
it
does
show
that
cheng
shin
bought
from
other
suppliers?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
client
just
supplied
part
of
the
demand--
justice
byron
r.
white
--for
that
particular
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
some
of
his
valves
might
have
gone
to
california
and
perhaps
none
of
them
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
their
valves.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
were
that
many
tires
sold.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
client
at
least
knew
that
cheng
shin's
tires
were
being
sold
in
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
the
only
thing...
and
you
knew
that
there's
a
chance
then
that
some
of
your
valves
would
get
to
california.
but
there
was
a
chance...
there
also
was
a
chance,
i
suppose,
that
none
of
them
would,
because
you
didn't
supply
all
of
the
valves
for
cheng
shin?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
would
be
the
same
if
your
client
knew
that
they
supplied
100
percent
of
the
requirements
of
the
tire
manufacturer
and
they
knew
that
every
tire
that
that
manufacturer
sent
into
california
had
your
valve
in
it?
you
would
say
no
jurisdiction?
that's
the
same
question
as
justice
stevens
asked.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
every
tire
that
they
ship
to
california
has
your
valve
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
same
question,
though,
that
justice
stevens
asked
you.
