justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
prevail
up
here
and
you
go
back
and
have
a
trial
in
the
district
court
and
lose
again.
what
in
judge
reuben's
opinion
for
ca5
would
keep
you
from
coming
back
here,
going
back
through
ca5,
saying
that
your
client
had
discovered
a
new
claim
that
he
hadn't
thought
about
raising
below?
in
light
of
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
couldn't
you
come
back
a
second
and
a
third
and
a
fourth
time?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but...
well,
take
a
look
at
f2
in
your
petition,
amended
petition
for
cert.
it
is
a
printed
document.
well,
i
don't
want
to
hold
you
up.
just
carry
on,
counsel.
that
is
all
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
agree
with
you
xxx
say
whether
or
not
you
can
come
back
repetitively,
but
i
think
the
rationale
of
its
opinion
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
thinks
you
can
come
back
whenever
a
claim
is
presented
at
the
fifth
circuit
level
that
had
not
been
presented
below.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
think
it
is
a
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
court
of
appeals?
