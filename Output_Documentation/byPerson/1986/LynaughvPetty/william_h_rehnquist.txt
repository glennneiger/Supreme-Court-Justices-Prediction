chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
85-1656,
james
a.
lynaugh,
interim
director,
texas
department
of
corrections,
versus
gregory
allen
petty.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
palmer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
if
he
had
raised...
filed
another
petition
making
the
claim
which
the
court
of
appeals
actually
considered
on
this
one,
then
you
could
have
argued
abuse
of
the
writ.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
palmer.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
breihan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
agreed...
did
the
fifth
circuit
opine
on
the
question
of
whether
that
claim
had
been
exhausted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
agree
that
the
claim
had
not
been
exhausted?
let
me...
do
you
challenge
the
fifth
circuit's--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
what
you
are
defending
here
is
the
fifth
circuit's
treatment
of
this
amended
claim
on
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
extreme?
you
say
this
was
an
extreme
case
that
provoked
this
reaction
on
the
part
of
the
fifth
circuit.
what
was
extreme
about
it
that
distinguishes
it
from
any
other
habeas
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
something
that
almost
never
happens
in
other
habeas
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
doesn't
make
this
case
extreme.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
have
reason
to
think
that
doesn't
happen
fairly
often
in
habeas
cases?
i
don't
see
what
it
is
about
that
fact
that
makes
this
case
so
extreme
so
that,
as
you
are
saying,
really
it
is
a
sport
that
we
don't
have
worry
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
a
lot
of
habeas
litigation
pro
se?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
seems
to
me
none
of
the
factors
that
you
have
mentioned
just
now
tell
us
that
this
case
is
any
different
from
hundreds
of
others
that
may
be
going
through
the
court
of
appeals,
so
therefore
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
to
follow
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
here
this
would
become
a
common
practice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
breihan,
do
you
think
perhaps
some
change
in
the
habeas
form
application
in
the
district
courts
might
solve
this
problem?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
breihan.
mr.
palmer,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
palmer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
have
the
judgments
of
the
court
to
announce
announce
in
two
cases
no.
85-303,
missouri
against
blair,
no.
85-1656,
lynaugh
against
petty.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
