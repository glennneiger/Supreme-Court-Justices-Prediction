justice
byron
r.
white
why
couldn't
you
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
allowing
this
amendment
would
be
an
abuse
of
the
writ?
and
also
you
could
argue
if
there
hasn't
been
any
exhaustion
of
this
particular
issue,
you
could
argue
there
was
no
exhaustion.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
abuse?
did
you
argue
abuse?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
might,
have
remanded
and
said
we
have
to
consider
abuse
of
the
writ
before
the
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
didn't
ask
them
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
no
amendment,
you
didn't
raise
it,
no
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
could
have
said
you
have
to
file
a
new
lawsuit
or
something,
new
petition.
