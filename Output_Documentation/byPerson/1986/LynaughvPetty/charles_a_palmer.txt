mr.
charles
a.
palmer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
statutory
habeas
corpus
case
brought
by
a
texas
prisoner
serving
a
50-year
sentence
for
aggravated
robbery.
the
first
question
presented
is
whether
the
petitioner
was
required
to
plead
prejudice
in
order
to
avoid
dismissal
of
the
sixth
amendment
claim
by
the
district
court.
i
believe
it
is
clear
under
strickland
versus
washington
and
hill
versus
lockhart
that
he
was
required
to
do
so,
and
i
do
not
intend
to
dwell
on
this
point.
i
believe
the
important
question
for
the
court's
decision
is
the
propriety
of
the
fifth
circuit's
disposition
of
the
new
issues
which
petty
raised
on
appeal.
petty
was
tried
on
his
plea
of
not
guilty
and
convicted
in
state
court
in
1979,
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
state
appellate
court.
he
then
filed
a
state
application
for
collateral
relief,
raising
two
grounds,
one
of
which
was
that
his
counsel's
representation
had
been
constitutionally
inadequate.
the
convicting
court
found
that
petty
had
not
pled
facts
which
would
entitle
his
to
relief
and
recommended
that
the
writ
be
denied.
the
state
appellate
court
denied
the
writ
on
this
basis.
petty
then
filed
a
habeas
petition
in
federal
district
court
in
which
he
raised
six
claims,
including
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
petty's
federal
claim
was
couched
in
the
same
conclusory
terms
as
had
been
his
state
claims.
accordingly,
the
state's
answer
pointed
out
that
petty
had
not
alleged
facts
which
if
true
would
entitle
him
to
habeas
relief.
the
magistrate
to
whom
the
case
was
referred
agreed
and
recommended
denial
of
the
writ
because
petty's
pleadings
were
insufficient
under
existing
fifth
circuit
law.
petty
did
not
object
to
the
magistrate's
recommendation,
and
it
was
adopted
by
the
district
court,
which
denied
the
writ.
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
petty
raised
for
the
first
time
in
any
court
specific
factual
allegations
as
to
his
counsel's
performance
and
how
it
allegedly
affected
the
outcome
of
his
trial.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded,
holding
that
petty
should
be
allowed
the
opportunity
to
amend
his
petition
in
the
court
below
to
include
the
allegation
that
counsel
should
have
investigated
a
possible
defense
of
insanity.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
the
general
rule
that
issues
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
ordinarily
are
not
considered,
but
ignored
the
rule
because
in
its
words,
the
fact
that
petty
has
now
made
these
allegations
indicates
that
he
would
make
them
in
the
district
court
if
he
were
given
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
the
problem
with
this
standard
is
that
it
is
no
standard
at
all.
there
will
never
be
a
case
where
new
issues
are
raised
on
appeal
that
will
not
come
within
this
rule.
under
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals,
habeas
petitioners
are
entitled
to
a
remand
as
a
matter
of
right
whenever
they
bring
forth
new
issues
on
appeal.
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
approach
is
contrary
to
the
admonitions
of
this
court
as
expressed,
for
example,
in
rose
v.
lundy,
that
habeas
petitioners
should
marshall
all
their
claims
in
a
single
petition
and
make
but
one
trip
to
the
state
and
federal
courts
in
seeking
relief.
what
is
worse,
under
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
prevent
petty
from
bringing
forth
additional
new
issues
on
a
subsequent
appeal
and
obtaining
yet
another
remand
with
directions
to
allow
him
to
amend.
the
end
result
is
that
there
will
be
absolutely
no
semblance
of
finality
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
we
could
argue
that.
i
believe
it
would
be
futile.
i
can't
imagine
the
district
court
granting
our
motion
when
the
remand
with
directions
to
allow
an
amendment
was
expressly
ordered
by
a
higher
court.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
followed
the
normal
procedure
and
simply
affirmed
the
district
court
without
reaching
this
issue,
petty
would
have
had
to
initiate
a
new
lawsuit
in
order
to
raise
this
claim.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor,
the
abuse
issue
was
never
raised
by
either
party.
it
was
not
briefed.
whether
or
not
a
petitioner
has
abused
the
writ
is
a
factual
issue.
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
plead
abuse
of
the
writ.
once
the
state
has
done
so
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
petitioner
to
shot
that
he
was
unaware
of
a
particular
claim
or
claims.
none
of
this
has
been
developed
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.
what
the
district
court
did
was
simply
give
petty
an
end
run
around
the
abuse
doctrine
and
it
spells
it
out
quite
clearly
in
its
opinion.
it
says
once
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
the
state
will
be
allowed
to
plead
failure
to
exhaust
state
remedies
because
it
is
clear
petty
has
not
exhausted
his
state
remedies
as
to
these
claims,
if
the
state
does
so
the
district
court
will
have
to
dismiss
on
that
ground.
its
dismissal
will
be
without
prejudice,
and
then
petty
rill
be
free
to
initiate
a
new
lawsuit.
i
think
the
only
fair
reading
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
to
relieve
petty
of
his
burden
of
justifying
not
bringing
this
claim
earlier.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
there
had
been
no
exhaustion.
in
remanding
to
the
district
court
it
opined
that
perhaps
the
state
would
wish
to
waive
the
exhaustion
defense.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no.
your
honor,
because
abuse
is
a
factual
matter,
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
the
proper
forum
to
develop
a
factual
issue-such
as
abuse.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
they
might
have
done
that,
your
honor
but
that
is
not
the
case
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
that
is
true.
we
didn't.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
the
fact
that
petty--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--the
abuse
doctrine
goes
to
whether
the
petitioner
was
aware
of
the
claim
at
the
time
he
filed
his
federal
application
and
failed
to
raise
that
claim,
and
then
in
the
second
federal
petition
raised
the
claim--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
your
honor,
we
are
not
here
arguing--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--we
are
not
arguing
that
this
is
or
is
not
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
as
we
stated
in
our
brief--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--well,
we
cited
the
court
to
woodard
v.
hutchins,
in
which
the
court
opined
or
stated
that
a
claim
like
this,
an
insanity
claim
surely
was
known
to
the
petitioner,
and
failure
to
bring
it
would
obviously
constitute
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
what
is
important
to
keep
in
mind,
i
believe,
is
not
whether
or
not
petty
abused
the
writ.
he
may
or
he
may
not.
once
the
state
is
allowed
the
opportunity
to
plead
abuse
of
the
writ,
petty
will
be
allowed
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
that,
anti
depending
on
petty's
justification
tor
withholding
the
claim,
it
may
or
may
not
constitute
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
what
is
at
stake
here
is,
the
state
is
not
allowed
the
opportunity
to
plead
it.
petty
is
sent
back
to
the
district
court
and
allowed
to
amend.
it
is
all
the
same
case.
it
is
not
a
new
case,
and
the
abuse
doctrine
simply
does
not
apply.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
he
never
made
the
claim
when
he
filed
his
writ
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i
agree
with
that.
but
the
point
is,
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
followed
what
i
understand
to
be
normal
appellate
procedure
it
would
not
have
considered
this
matter
whatsoever.
it
simply
would
have
said
this
was
a
claim
that
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below.
we
are
not
entitled
to
consider
it.
it
would
have
reviewed
the
claims
petty
raised
and
affirmed
on
that
basis.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
precisely,
your
honor.
now,
justice
white
has
suggested
that
perhaps
once
petty
was
allowed
to
amend,
we
could
have
pleaded
abuse
at
that
point,
and
perhaps
we
could,
but
once
the
fifth
circuit
had
sanctioned
the
amendment
it
is
very
difficult
to
conceive
that
the
district
court
would
sustain
the
state's
abuse
argument.
petty
makes
several
arguments
in
this
court
to
uphold
the
propriety
of
the
fifth
circuit's
disposition,
the
first
of
which
is
that
the
district
court's
dismissal
was
due
to
a
defect
in
pleadings
and
therefore
was
not
on
the
merits.
we
do
not
believe
that
is
an
accurate
statement
of
how
habeas
cases
are
disposed
of.
in
a
habeas
case
such
as
this,
when
the
district
court
considers
the
pleadings
and
the
state
court
record,
its
decision
to
deny
relief
necessarily
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
petitioner's
claim,
and
the
dismissal
then
is
with
prejudice.
the
dismissal
with
prejudice
on
this
record
in
no
sense
is
unfair
to
habeas
petitioners,
however,
because
unlike
ordinary
civil
suits
there
is
no
principle
of
res
judicata.
habeas
petitioners
are
free
to
re-litigate
the
constitutionality
of
their
convictions
again
and
again
subject
only
to
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine.
petty
also
argues
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
not
ordering
discovery
under
rule
6
or
expansion
of
the
record
under
rule
7.
of
course,
the
district
court
was
under
no
duty
to
do
so,
and
given
the
vague
and
conclusory
nature
of
petty's
allegations
there
was
simply
nothing
to
suggest
to
it
that
utilization
of
those
rules
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case.
finally,
petty
argues
that
he
was
not
put
on
sufficient
notice
of
the
inadequacy
of
his
pleadings.
petty
filed
his
federal
petition
on
march
the
7th,
1984.
more
than
seven
months
previously
when
the
state
convicting
court
filed
its
findings,
it
noted
that
he
had
not
pled
sufficient
facts
to
justify
relief
on
a
sixth
amendment
claim.
the
forum
which
petty
used
to
file
his
federal
writ
instructed
him
that
it
was
necessary
to
raise
all
the
facts
in
support
of
each
of
the
claims,
and
even
advised
him
that
it
is
permissible
to
attach
additional
pages
to
include
the
facts
if
necessary.
both
the
state's
answer
and
the
magistrate's
report
pointed
out
to
petty
that
he
had
not
pied
sufficient
facts
to
justify
relief.
given
this
record,
it
is
at
best
disingenuous
to
suggest
that
petty
was
not
afforded
an
opportunity
to
plead
his
case
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
your
honor,
it
was
not
appointed
counsel
for
petty
on
appeal
who
raised
this.
it
was
petty
himself
in
his
pro
se
brief.
it
was
only
after
petty
raised
this
matter
in
his
pro
so
brief
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
his.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
now,
of
course,
the
matter
was
also
included
in
the
brief
filed
by
counsel
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
i
am
aware
of
no
authority
which
allows
for
the
disposition
made
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
an
anomaly,
and
it
is
one
that
is
unfair
to
the
states
and
burdensome
to
the
courts.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
if
it
had
been
affirmed
he
would
have
had
to
go
back
to
state
court
and
exhaust
his
remedies
before
he
would
be
entitled
to
file
a
second
petition.
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
the
big
difference,
the
significant,
difference
is,
given
the
way
the
fifth
circuit
handled
the
case,
petty
is
allowed
to
amend
to
raise
this
claim.
this
claim
is
unexhausted.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
therefore
the
amended
petition
will
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
exhaust.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
that
dismissal
will
be
without
prejudice.
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
does
not
trigger
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine.
when
petty
comes
back
into
state
court...
into
federal
court
after
exhausting
the
state
remedies,
the
state
will
have
no
opportunity
whatsoever
to
plead
abuse
because
there
has
been
no
adjudication
on
the
merits.
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
followed
normal
procedure--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--there
would
have
been
no
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
any
of
the
claims.
the
district
court
denied
relief
on
the
merits.
the
fifth
circuit
failed
to
affirm,
sent
the
case
back.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
and
once
the
exhaustion
issue
is
raised
after
the
remand,
the
dismissal
for
failure
to
exhaust
will
not
be
on
the
merits,
it
will
be
without
prejudice.
there
will
never
have
been
a
final
adjudication
of
petty's
first
petition
on
the
merits.
on
the
other
hand,
what
the
state
is
arguing
for
and
what
we
understand
to
be
the
normal
procedure
is
simply
to
affirm
without
considering
this
matter.
then
there
is
finality
to
the
district
court's
determination
that
petty's
first
petition
was
without
merit.
there
is
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
which
has
been
affirmed.
the
only
way
petty
can
raise
this
claim
then
is
by
initiating
a
brand
new
lawsuit
in
the
federal
court
in
which
he
relies
the
latter
because
there
will
have
been
a
disposition
on
the
merits.
the
state
then
is
entitled
to
raise
its
9b
defense.
in
conclusion,
we
ask
the
court
to
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
abused
its
discretion
in
its
disposition
of
petty's
appeal.
the
courts
of
appeals
would
thereby
be
put
on
notice
that
their
discretion
in
this
area
is
not
unlimited,
that
it
may
not
be
exercised
in
such
a
way
as
to
deprive
the
state
of
its
opportunity
to
plead
abuse
of
the
writ.
the
result
we
ask
for
is
consistent
with
the
equitable
nature
of
habeas
corpus
in
that
it
upholds
society's
valid
interest
in
finality
and
in
the
orderly
administration
of
justice,
and
it
in
no
way
impinges
on
the
rights
of
habeas
petitioners
to
raise
these
new
claims.
in
this
case
as
in
any
other
similar
to
this
a
petitioner
always
can
justify
raising
this
new
claim
if
he
can
show
that
he
was
unaware
of
it
or
that
he
did
not
abuse
the
writ.
for
these
reasons,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
no
further
argument.
i
believe
mr.
justice
scalia
has
zeroed
in
on
the
crux
of
the
case.
anything
that
would
excuse,
that
would
justify
the
fifth
circuit's
disposition
would
also
excuse
petty
if
he
brought
this
claim
in
a
new
lawsuit,
and
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out,
there
is
nothing
extreme
or
unusual
about
this
case
that
justifies
that
disposition.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
dismiss
for
failure
to
exhaust.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
the
entire
petition
would
have
had
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
right,
and
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
at
f5
this
new
factual
allegation
is
treated
as
a
new
claim.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
we
couldn't.
the
point
is,
petty
had
his
chance.
he
had
more
than
ample
chance.
when
the
state
convicting
court
made
its
findings
it
told
petty,
you
have
not
pied
a
case.
seven
months
later
he
came
into
federal
court--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--no,
your
honor.
i
am
talking
about
what
the
state
convicting
court
did
on
petty's
state
application.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
the
state
convicting
court
said
you

it
was
seven
months
later
that
petty
came
into
federal
court
with
the
same
conclusory
claims,
and
once
he
got
into
federal
court
the
state's
answer
told
him
you
still
haven't
stated
the
claim.
the
magistrate's
report
told
him,
you
still
haven't
stated
a
claim.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor,
he
reviewed
the
entire
transcript
in
light
of
what
petty
had
pled.
mr.
charles

palmer
it
wasn't
until
the
appellate
level
that
petty
raised
these
matters,
but
he
certainly
had
ample
opportunity
to

so.
mr.

thank
you.
