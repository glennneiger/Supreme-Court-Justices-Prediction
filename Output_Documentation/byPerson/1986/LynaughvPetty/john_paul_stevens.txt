justice
john
paul
stevens
general
palmer,
what
it
really
boils
down
to,
isn't
it,
that
you
want
to
be
able
to
argue
effectively
that
there
is
an
abuse
of
the
writ
because
even
it
they
had
just
not
taken
this
disposition,
he
could
still
have
filed
a
second
habeas
petition,
but
you
would
have
claimed
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
the
writ
if
he
had?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
can't
you
still
argue
on
remand
to
the
district
court
that
there
is
an
abuse
of
the
writ
here
because
he
should
have
raised
these
things
the
first
time
around?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
should
we
really
construe
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
as
in
effect
holding
that
given
the
particular
history
of
this
case
we
don't
think
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
the
writ
for
him
now
to
raise
these
issues
so
let's
just
have
him
raise
them
in
this
case
instead
of
filing
a
new
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
the
facts
for
just
a
second.
in
this
case
the
initial
pleading
alleged
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
recited
a
lot
of
facts
that
did
not
establish
it,
according
to
the
magistrate.
it
did
not
allege
the
theory
that
the
counsel
failed
to
investigate
the
possible
insanity
of
the
defendant.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
on
appeal
the
counsel
became
aware
of
this
alleged
shortcoming
of
counsel.
what,
in
your
view,
should
counsel
who
has
just
been
appointed,
what
should
the
counsel
have
done
at
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see,
so
that
petty
himself
raised
the
failure
to
investigate
the
insanity.
i
was
thinking
the
lawyer
did
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
your
view
is
that
they
should
have
just
affirmed
and
then
let
him
take
his
chances
on
tiling
a
second
habeas
petition
making
these
allegations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose,
though,
if
he
had
just...
if
they
just
affirmed
and
he
filed
the
second
petition
the
district
court
would
have
had
to
dismiss
it
because
it
hadn't
been
exhausted.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
are
going
to
dismiss
this
one
anyway,
and
he
has
to
go
back
to
state
court.
i
am
just
not
quite
clear
on
how
much
difference
it
all
makes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
would
be
no
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
the
defective
assistance
of
counsel
based
on
the
failure
to
investigate
insanity
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
that
troubles
me
a
little
bit
about
this
case
is
that
this...
apparently
this
really
isn't
a
new
claim,
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
didn't
investigate
the
insanity
defense.
those
are
facts
that
tend
to
support
the
claim
that
was
made.
and
he
did
allege
a
good
many
facts
but
just
didn't
include
this
particular
group
of
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
that
in
this
case
the
magistrate
did
not
go
into
the
facts
other
than
those
set
forth
in
the
habeas
petition,
and
apparently
he
also
knew
that
the
lawyer
had
represented
the
same
defendant
in
some
other
matters,
i
guess?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
i
am
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
district
court
when
the
magistrate
reached
his
conclusions
and
wrote
out
his
report,
that,
i
take
it,
is
sent
to
the
prisoner
so
he
had
a
copy
of
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
at
least
it
would
have
been...
presumably
in
most
cases
if
the
pleading
is
a
little...
doesn't
go
into
the
facts
enough
he
at
least
theoretically
could
have
responded
back
at
the
district
court
level
and
said
you
have
overlooked
these
facts,
the
ones
he
calls
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
it
could
have
been
processed
in
the
district
court.
that
could
have
been
done,
couldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
i
understand.
maybe
he
wasn't
wise
enough
in
the
ways
of
the
law
to
do
that,
but
at
least
had
he
been
fully
informed
and
represented
by
able
counsel
at
that
time
i
suppose
that
is
what
the
lawyer
would
have
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
said
that
you
have
these
additional
facts
that
support
the
ineffective
assistance
claim,
and
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
any...
dismissal
with
prejudice
would
have
foreclosed
that
at
that
time.
so
the
problem
is
that
he
didn't
do
it
then,
he
did
it
on
appeal
for
the
first
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
also
true
that
the
magistrate's
disposition
is
not
the
traditional
ruling
on
the
legal
insufficiency
of
the
pleading,
because
it
is
kind
of
a
mixture
of
his
having
looked
at
the
record
and
satisfying
himself,
which
would
be
good
practice
for
the
magistrate,
that
there
was...
there
appeared
to
be
effective
assistance,
so
his
dismissal
was
kind
of
a
mixture
of
insufficiency
on
the
face
and
not
a
full
hearing,
but
yet
enough
of
a
look
at
the
facts
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
it
wouldn't
show
that,
but
he
did
have
a
transcript
of
the
trial
proceeding,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he
talked
about
the
voir
dire.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
before
you
sit
down,
general?
had
he
realized
what
he
was
supposed
to
do
in
the
district
court,
say
he
had
gotten
a
copy
of
the
magistrate's
report
and
say
he
had
then
in
the
district
court
said,
hey,
i
should
have
explained
the
facts
about
my
prior
insanity
or
whatever
it
is.
what
would
the
magistrate
or
the
district
court
have
properly
done
in
response
to
those
allegations
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
dismiss
just
that
part
of
the
claim
but
not
the
whole--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
there
was
an
unexhausted
claim.
he
did
exhaust
his...
did
he
exhaust
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
before
bit
just
not
making
these
factual
allegations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
so
that
had
he
done
this
in
the
district
court
he
would
then
have...
there
would
have
been
a
dismissal
for
failure
to
exhaust
and...
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
going
to
happen
under
the
court
of
appeals
disposition
but
you
object
to
that
because
you
cannot
now
argue
abuse
of
the
writ,
but
could
you
have
argued
abuse
of
the
writ
if
it
happened
in
the
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wasn't
quite
not
plea
a
case
because
the
magistrate
did
look
at
the
record.
he
did
go
beyond
the
pleading,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
pardon
me.
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
magistrate
didn't
dismiss
it
without
at
least
looking
at
the
transcript.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
