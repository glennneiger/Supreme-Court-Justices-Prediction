mr.
john
r.
breihan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
from
petty's
perspective
what
this
case
is
really
about
is
the
ability
of
the
circuit
judges
to
administer
their
dockets
with
flexibility
and
common
sense.
in
other
words,
we
are
of
the
view
that
the
circuit
courts
have
the
power
to
do
what
they
consider
is
just
under
the
circumstances.
this
case
in
federal
court
arose
in
1984
when
mr.
petty
filed
his
first
and
only
habeas
action.
in
that
action
he
raised
the
issue
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
by
pleading
that
his
counsel
had
not
conducted
a
pretrial
investigation
and
had
not
rendered
any
advice
as
to
the
charges
against
him
and
the
issues
raised
at
trial.
the
district
court
dismissed
this
petition
after
first
finding
that
his
pleadings
were
insufficient.
it
is
in
this
context
that
after
that
the...
in
his
pro
se
brief
to
the
fifth
circuit
mr.
petty
expanded
upon
his
claim
that
his
counsel
had
not
conducted
the
pretrial
investigation
by
then
alleging
that
the
pretrial
investigation
would
have
revealed
facts
that
supported
the
insanity
defense
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
the
fifth
circuit
stated
in
its
opinion
that
that
claim
probably
had
not
been
exhausted,
and
that
is
why
instead
of
reversing
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
it
reversed
for
amendment
so
that
the
state
could
respond
and
pursue
its
exhaustion
defense
if
it
chose
to.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
at
this
point
i
don't
challenge
that
issue.
i
have
not
given
that
a
substantial
amount
of
thought,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
an
issue
that
will
be
raised
with
whichever
disposition
comes
of
this
case.
it
is
an
issue
that
will
be
before
the
district
court,
the
exhaustion
issue.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
what
we
are
defending
is
the
fifth
circuit's
power
to
handle
its
docket
in
the
way
that
it
considered
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
i
don't
know
that
there
is
anything
in
the
language
of
the
opinion
that
addresses
that
issue
directly.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
i
think,
though,
it
is
the
exercise...
it
is
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
claim
that
caused
the
fifth
circuit
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
this
case,
and
i
do
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
limited
in
the
exercise
of
that
flexibility
and
discretion.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
i
am
not
certain
that
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
i
would
agree.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
my
position
that
the
situation
in
this
case
that
petty
had
alleged
at
the
trial
court
level
that
he
had...
that
his
counsel
had
failed
to
pursue
any
pretrial
investigation.
at
the
appellate
court
level
after
the
trial
court
level...
the
trial
court
had
dismissed
that
claim
for
insufficiency.
at
the
appellate
court
level
mr.
petty
showed
in
his
pro
se
brief
that
he
had...
that
he
had
a
substantial
prejudiced
claim,
that
claim
being
that
had
his
counsel
presented,
or
had
his
counsel
pursued
a
pretrial
investigation
she
would
have
realized
that
he
had
facts
that
supported
an
insanity
defense
and
brought
that
issue
at
the
trial
court
below.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
my
response,
your
honor,
is
that
the
actions
of
the
fifth
circuit
under
the
extreme
circumstances
of
this
case
was
to
expediate
the...
expediate
justice,
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
for
amendment
so
that
the
court
could
get
right
to
its
business
of
considering
this
new
claim.
in
that
sense,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
this
is
an
abuse
case
or
indeed
is
a
rule
9
case
of
any
kind,
because
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
done
is
to
limit
mr.
petty
to
one
petition.
it
has
sent
the
case
back
for
amendment.
mr.
petty's
first
and
only
so
far
habeas
petition
has
been
now
sent
back--
mr.
john
r.
breihan
--first
of
all,
under
the
circumstances,
the
petition
that
mr.
petty
filed
had
alleged
the
fact
of
a
lack
of
a
pretrial
investigation.
he
had
not
gone
any
further,
but
the
district
court
had
purported
to
reach
the
merits
of
that
claim
though
the
issues
raised
by
the
lack
of
pretrial
investigation
claim,
if
you
will,
arise
to
a
certain
extent
beyond
the
record,
and
a
review
of
the
record
itself
is
not
entirely
sufficient
to
address
that
claim.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
i
suppose
that
happens
often
enough,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
what
makes
this
case
a
special
case
to
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
mr.
petty
came
forward
with
the
issue
of
prejudice
on
appeal.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
consider
that
issue.
they
didn't
consider
the
truth
of
that
issue.
they
simply
sent
the
case
back
for
amendment
so
that
that
issue
could
be
addressed
quickly
and
efficiently
in
the
district
court.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
it
is
a...
this
is...
in
the
interest
of
handling
pro
se
litigation
i
believe
it
is
simply
an
act
of
discretion.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
certainly.
most
of
it
probably
is.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
it
may
become
a
common
practice,
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
mean
that
it
would
become
a...
it
would
be
common
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
handle
the
case
in
this
way.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
well,
to
me,
your
honor,
the
key
issue
is
simply
the
fact
that
in
this
case
the
fifth
circuit
has
sent
it
back...
sent
it
back
so
that
this
can
be
the
one
and
only
petition
that
mr.
petty
files.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
well,
because
it--
mr.
john
r.
breihan
--he
could
file
another
one,
but
not
on
these
claims,
absent
being
challenged
by
the
abuse
of
writ
doctrine
from
the
state.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
special
circumstances
in
this
case,
and
that
is
why
i
do
not
consider
it
an
abuse
of
the
writ
case.
i
think
it
would
fall
within
the
first
part
of
rule
9,
which
is
the
part
that
addresses...
if
it
falls
within
rule
9
at
all,
it
would
fall
within
the
first
part,
that
addresses
an
issue
that
is
not
new
and
different
and
was
considered
on
the
merits
below.
even
that
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
rule.
that
was
part
of
the
poolman
decision,
i
believe,
that
said
when
it
is
an
issue
that
is
in
the
interest
of
justice
goes
to
the
factual
innocence
the
lower
court
can
go
ahead
and
reach
the
merits
of
that
case
and
the
abuse
defense
will
be
waived.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
the
magistrate
addressed...
the
magistrate
first
concluded
that
petty's
pleading
was
insufficient.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
then
reviewed
the
record
to
determine
such
things
as
the
fact
that
his
counsel
had
conducted
a
voir
dire
examination--
mr.
john
r.
breihan
--cross
examined
witnesses,
and
conducted
a
closing
argument.
0....
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
consider,
if
you
will,
the
issues
that
were
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
it
did
not
make
any
determination
about
the
truthfulness
of
those
issues.
it
sent
those
directly
back
to
the
district
court
for
factual
findings
and
preserved
the
interest
of
the
state
and
preserved
the
interest
of
the
judicial
system
in
efficiency,
if
you
will,
and
to
further
the
quick
consideration
of
this
claim.
the
key
points
that
i
would
again
repeat
are
that
the
fifth
circuit's
handling
of
this
case
is
in
everyone's
interest.
it
has
in
this
particular
instance
created
a
situation
where
these
claims
can
be
handled
quickly
at
the
district
court
level.
that
is
in
the
state's
interest
to
limit
petty
to
a
single
petition.
the
circuit
courts
and
the
circuit
judges
in
this
case
are--
mr.
john
r.
breihan
--yes.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
as
a
pro
se
petitioner
he
is
limited
in
his
ability,
of
course,
to
understand
whatever
he
has
been
told
by
the--
mr.
john
r.
breihan
--i
suppose.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
well,
i
think
there
is
some...
that
issue
is
presented
to
the
extent
that
mr.
petty
is
a
pro
se
petitioner
and
has
followed
the
form
pleading
when
he
stated
his
case
in
summary
fashion.
he
alleged
facts
which
from
his
perspective
were
factual.
he
alleged
that
there
was
no
pretrial
investigation.
he
alleged
that
there
was
no
advice
given
from
his
perspective.
that
is
a
factual
argument,
though,
from
the
court's
perspective
and
lawyers'
perspective.
those
are
conclusions.
it
may
help,
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
to
change
the
language
of
the
form
to
the
extent
of
asking
the
petitioner
to
explain
why
it
is
that
an
error
of
counsel
affected
the
outcome
of
the
case.
that
may
have
gotten
mr.
petty
over
the
hurdle
by
bringing
his
attention
to
the
need
to
address
that
issue.
one
of
the
circumstances
that
was
involved
in
this
case
was
that
mr.
petty
had
filed
his
petition
before
this
court's
decisions
in
strickland
and
hill
versus
lockhart,
so
that
not
necessarily
that
he
would
have
paid
any
attention
to
those
decisions,
but
when
the
fifth
circuit
considers
his
petition
they
are
aware
that
those
pleading
standards
were
in
flux
at
the
time
that
mr.
petty's
pleading
was
being
considered.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
his
dismissal
was
based
on
the
record
that
was
in
front
of
him,
but
i
repeat
that
the
record
in
front
of
him
doesn't
include
anything
that
reveals
the
extent
of
pretrial
investigation
other
than
by
inference.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
yes,
he
did.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
and
so
to
a
certain
extent
issues
that
were
raised,
inferential
inferences
can
be
raised
based
on
the
fact
that
mr.
petty...
mr.
petty's
counsel
was
familiar
with
some
facts,
though
that
does
not
go
to
the
advice
given
mr.
petty
during
the
course
of
the
pretrial
preparation.
to
sum
up,
i
want
to
repeat
that
from
our
perspective
the
remand
of
this
case
serves
the
interest
of
all
the
parties
by
expediting
the
review
of
this
case
on
the
merits.
it
enables
petty
to
be
heard
on
his
expanded
plea
of
ineffective
assistance,
and
that
is
a
plea
that
goes
to
the
very
guilt
or
innocence.
it
protects
the
state
to
a
certain
extent
from
piecemeal
litigation
by
addressing
that
issue
directly
as
quickly
as
possible,
and
in
the
interest
of
the
court
system
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
mr.
petty's
claim
to
be
resolved
quickly
and
efficiently.
in
these
respects
remand
was
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
court's
power.
it
considered
the
circumstances,
and
it
balanced
the
interest
from
its
perspective
in
its
discretion
of
those
interests.
whatever
this
court
does
with
this
case
is
going
to
send
a
signal,
of
course,
to
the
circuit
courts
about
the
way
that
they
handle
complex
problems
such
as
pro
se
litigation.
that
signal
should
not
be
to
tie
their
hands
in
a
way
to
prevent
them
from
addressing
questions
that
were
raised
on
appeal
if
the
merits
of
the
case
support
that.
the
message
should
instead
be
to
let
the
judges
do
their
job,
the
circuit
judges
to
do
their
job
as
best
as
they
see
fit.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
i
would
say--
mr.
john
r.
breihan
--no,
i
would
not
think
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
it
could
have.
mr.
john
r.
breihan
it
could
have
sent
it
back
for
a
new
petition.
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
i
pray
that
the
court
will
affirm
the
fifth
circuit's
ruling.
