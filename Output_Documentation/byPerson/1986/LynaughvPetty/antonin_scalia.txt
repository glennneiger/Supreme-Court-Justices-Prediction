justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
what
would
the
abuse
of
the
wilt
have
consisted
of?
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
saying
something?
i
wouldn't
have
seen
any
basis
for
arguing
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
to
have
raised
the
claim.
it
is
the
second
time
around
when
he
raises
the
claim
that
the
writ
is
abused.
he
never
raised
the
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
there
have
been
an
abuse
of
the
writ?
maybe
you
could
say
it
was
an
abuse
of
the
appellate
process
to
raise
the
claim
on
appeal
when
he
hadn't
raised
it
below,
but
i
don't
know
how
that
could
be
considered
abuse
of
the
writ.
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
trying
to
help
you,
general.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
basis
on
which
it
could
nave
been
an
abuse
of
the
writ?
justice
antonin
scalia
abuse
of
the
writ
does
not
consist
in
withholding
a
claim,
does
it?
i
can
file
a
writ
without
making
a
claim.
i
am
not
abusing
the
writ.
if
i
choose
not
to
like
a
claim,
i
don't
have
to.
abuse
of
the
writ
consists
in
filing
a
writ
that
makes
a
claim
that
could
have
been
made
previously.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
what
abuse
of
the
writ
consists
of?
and
there
is
no
possible
way
he
could
have
been
guilty
of
that
here,
because
he
never
made
the
claim
in
a
writ.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
simply
failing
to
make
a
claim
when
you
file
a
writ
is
not
conceivably
abuse
of
a
writ.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
breihan,
why
isn't
it
the
case
that
when
a
matter
rises
to
significantly
enough
injustice
that
it
would
be
a
proper
exercise
of
the
court
of
appeals'
discretion
to
allow
the
matter
to
be
raised
anew
it
would
not
also
be
significant
enough
to
avoid
the
contention
of
abuse
of
the
writ
if
the
matter
were
raised
in
the
normal
fashion?
i
mean,
this
has
to
be
an
unusual
situation.
you
can't
have
the
court
of
appeals
doing
this
all
the
time
because
it
will,
as
your
opponent
suggests,
string
out
these
habeas
proceedings
until
doomsday,
but
if
the
situation
is
extraordinary
enough
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
act
in
this
fashion,
why
wouldn't
it
automatically
be
extraordinary
enough
that
when
an
additional
habeas
petition
were
brought
you
could
not
be
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
abuse
of
the
writ?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
can't
do
this
sort
of
thing
routinely,
that
it
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
allow
the
new
issue
to
be
raised
there
has
to
be
some
extraordinary
circumstance.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
all
that.
the
only
point
i
make...
i
don't
know
how
to
put
it
to
you
more
clearly...
is
that
it
seems
to
me
if
it
is
extraordinary
enough
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
step
in
and
allow
claims
that
haven't
been
made
to
be
made
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
would
also
be
extraordinary
enough
to
cause
the
district
court
to
entertain
a
subsequent
habeas
petition--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
that
therefore
we
really
don't
have
to
permit
this
kind
of
a
procedure,
which
you
acknowledge
has
its
dangers,
in
order
to
preserve
the
rights
of
defendants
to
be
defended
against
patent
injustice.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
it
be
a
logical
common
practice,
especially
for
a
capital
defendant
who
has
been
condemned
to
death,
to
raise
his
defenses
in
exactly
this
way?
not
be
specific
enough
in
the
original
habeas.
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
causing
the
court
of
appeals
to
send
it
back
down.
then
when
it
is
finally
denied,
he
can
rebring
another
habeas
afterwards,
string
the
process
along.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
will
it
be
the
one
and
only?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
file
a
petition
after
this
one
even
if
the
lower
court
denies
this.
he
can
then
file
another
one,
can't
he?
