chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
two
consolidated
cases,
interstate
commerce
commission
against
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
and
missouri-kansas-texas
railroad
company
against
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
rush.
chief

rehnquist
that
does
seem...
that
does
seem
to...
that
does
seem
to
disregard
the
60-day
reference
in
the
statute.
well,
isn't
this
a
matter
for
your
opposition
as
well
as
for
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
nor
is
eagle-picher...
nor
is
eagle-picher
a
decision
of
this
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
don't
you
spend
a
couple
of
minutes
on
the
merits
before
your--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rush.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
manson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manson.
we'll
hear
next
from
you,
mr
ross.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
ross,
eagle-picher
isn't
a
decision
of
this
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
all
that
was
properly
brought
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
refusal
of
the
commission
to,
in
effect,
rehear
a
petition
to
clarify,
i
would
think
the
standard
of
review
would
be
dramatically
different
than
if
you
were
really
bringing
the
merits
before
it
properly?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
merger
statute
that
the
icc
was
operating
under
in
this
case
didn't
have
any
specific
requirement
of
accommodation,
did
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there's
no
contention
that
there
was
a
failure
to
impose
that
here,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosee.
mr.
clarke?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say,
it
specifically
provides.
what
is
the
antecedent
of
"it"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
clarke.
mr.
rush,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
two
minutes
left?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rush.
the
case
is
submitted.
