mr.
joseph
l.
manson,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
rush
has
just
told
you
that
the
icc
wants
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
let
me
assure
you
that
the
missouri-kansas-texas
would
be
delighted
with
a
ruling
on
jurisdictional
grounds,
if
the
ruling
of
this
court
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
appeal
of
the
unions
below.
that's
precisely
what
we
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
moved
to
dismiss
the
action.
the
decision
of
the
icc
approving
the
merger
was
dated
october
the
20th,
1982.
according
to
judge
mackinnon,
he
found
that
the
time
for
an
appeal
under
the
hobbes
act
expired
on
december
the
20th,
1982.
yet
a
petition
for
clarification,
filed
by
the
unions,
the
bie
in
this
case,
was
not
filed
with
the
commission
until
april
the
4th,
1983.
the
administrative
orders
review
act,
or
the
hobbes
act,
provides
that
any
party
aggrieved
by
a
final
order
of
an
agency
may
within
60
days
file
a
petition
for
review.
in
our
judgment,
the
court
of
appeals
below
failed
to
follow
national
bank
of
davis
and
the
eagle-picher
decisions.
mr.
joseph
l.
manson,
iii
well,
it's
not
raised
in
our
cert
petition,
but
the
government
raised
it
in
there,
as
a
preliminary
matter
in
its
belief.
and
we
would
subscribe
to
the
government's
view
on
that
point.
turning
to
the
merits,
the
commission
conditioned
its
approval
of
the
union
pacific-missouri
pacific-western
pacific
merger
upon
a
grant
of
a
competitive
trackage
rights
application,
filed
by
the
missouri-kansas-texas
railroad.
in
that
application,
katy
proposed
to
use
its
own
crews,
and
to
operate
over
the
lines
of
its
principal
competitor,
the
missouri
pacific,
between
kansas
city
and
omaha.
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
and
the
united
transportation
union
represent
employees
on
both
the
katy
and
the
missouri
pacific.
despite
the
fact
that
both
of
those
unions
entered
into
implementing
agreements
with
katy,
on
behalf
of
katy
employees,
that
provided
that
the
katy
employees
would
provide
the
operations
in
this
trackage
rights
application,
those
unions
argue
in
this
case
that
missouri
pacific
employees
have
rights
under
the
railway
labor
act
to
bargain
with
the
missouri
pacific
concerning
the
crewing
of
katy's
trackage
rights
operation.
if
the
unions
are
correct
that
this
negotiation
is
governed
by
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act,
then
the
unions
would
have
the
right
to
strike
over
this
issue.
we
agree
with
the
government's
analysis
of
the
fundamental
errors
in
the
court
of
appeals
interpretation
of
the
consolidation
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
we
would
emphasize
that
this
statutory
scheme
was
enacted
by
congress
to
encourage
railroad
consolidations;
and
according
to
the
legislative
history,
to
restore
to
the
carriers
all
initiative
in
formulating
consolidation
proposals.
indeed,
this
court
noted
in
united
states
versus
interstate
commerce
commission,
that
although
the
commission
in
fulfilling
its
statutory
responsibilities
is
to
carefully
review
all
of
the
terms
of
a
merger
proposal,
and
determine
whether
they
are
just
and
reasonable,
it
is
not
for
the
agency,
much
less
the
courts,
to
dictate
the
terms
of
the
merger
agreement
once
this
standard
has
been
met.
unions
or
other
parties
contesting
trackage
rights
applications
have
never
been
given
the
rights
to
change
the
terms
of
the
carriers'
proposals,
as
the
unions
in
this
case
seek
to
do.
rather,
those
parties
are
given
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
to
the
commission
that
the
proposed
terms
and
conditions
are
inconsistent
with
the
public
interest.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
inconsistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
schwabacher
v.
united
states
and
texas
v.
united
states.
in
schwabacher,
the
court
held
that
once
the
commission
approved
a
railroad
merger
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
predecessor
of
sections
1130...
343
and
11344,
the
approved
transaction
goes
into
effect
without
the
need
for
invoking
any
approval
under
state
authority.
this
answers
the
question
that
you
raised,
justice
stevens,
about
the
date
of
the
effect
of
the
commission's
exemption.
that
exemption
was...
went
into
effect
as
soon
as
the
commission
approved
the
decision.
and
in
this
instance,
after
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
on
the
appeal
from
that
decision.
if
the
court
of
appeals'
necessity
standard
in
this
case--
mr.
joseph
l.
manson,
iii
--yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
the
focus,
in
my
judgment,
and
in
our
judgment,
has
to
be
on
the
impact
of
the
statute,
and
what
would
happen
under
the
statute
if
the
carriers
were
not
exempted
from
it.
even
if
the
crew
provisions
were
left
blank,
giving
the
unions
the
right
to
negotiate
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
identity
of
the
crews
would
also
give
them
a
concomitant
right
to
strike.
and
if
they're
given
the
right
to
strike,
then
the
trackage
rights
operation
can
be
frustrated.
and
that's
what
the
commission
recognized
in
its
decisions
in
this
case.
and
that's
what...
one
of
the
main
reasons
congress
intended
for
these
exemptions
to
apply.
but
under
the
court
of--
mr.
joseph
l.
manson,
iii
--that
provisions
means,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
the
rights
of
the
employees,
are
preserved,
but
in
the
context
of
the
commission's
approval.
you'll
see
that
there's
another
provision
of
the
labor
protective
conditions
that
provides
that
the
carriers
have
a
right
to
arbitrate
over
the
implementation
of
their
agreements,
in
article
i
section
4.
and
clearly
this
right
to
arbitrate
is
not
found
in
the
railway
labor
act.
this
right
to
arbitrate
disputes
in
implementations
necessarily
involves
the
overriding
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
especially
in
seniority
matters.
and
so
we
believe
that
that
article
i
section
2
on
the
preservation
of
collective
bargaining
rights
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
other
labor
protective
conditions
that
are
imposed;
and
more
importantly
in
this
case,
in
the
context
of
the
commission's
approval
of
the
transaction
at
issue.
mr.
joseph
l.
manson,
iii
well,
except,
i
would
say
principally...
the
principal
exception
would
be
with
respect
to
the
implementation
of
a
transaction.
if,
for
example,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
provide
that
there
could
be
no
layoffs,
and
the
commission
found
that
in
order
to
satisfy
the
public
interest,
there
had
to
be
a
consolidation
of
facilities
as
proposed
by
the
carriers,
then
that
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
must
give
way
to
the
commission's
approval.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
employees
are
not
left
out
in
the
cold.
they
have
a
whole
series
of
competitive
benefits,
of
compensation
benefits,
that
the
statute
provides,
including
the
receipt
of
full
pay
for
up
to
six
years
in
the
event
that
they
are
dismissed
as
a
result
of
the
transaction.
mr.
joseph
l.
manson,
iii
well,
because
i
think
that
it's
clear
from
the...
from
reading
article
i
section
4
in
conjunction
with
article
i
section
2,
and
it's
certainly
clear
from
the
decisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
from
the
legislative
history
and
decisions
of
the
courts,
that
provisions
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
must
give
way
to
implementation
of
commission-approved
transactions.
if
the
court
of
appeals'
necessity
standard
that
it
adopted
were
applied
to
the
facts
of
schwabacher,
the
carriers
would
not
have
been
able
to
be
exempted
from
the
michigan
state
law
at
issue
there,
since
the
state
law
did
not
preclude
the
merger
from
being
implemented.
likewise,
applying
the
majority's
rationale
to
the
facts
of
texas
v.
the
united
states
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
carriers
could
not
be
exempted
from
the
state
statute
at
issue
in
that
case,
for
the
same
reason.
but
the
most
glaring
error
in
the
majority's
opinion
is
its
failure
to
assess
whether
the
railway
labor
act
procedures
sought
to
be
enforced
by
the
unions
could
frustrate
the
implementation
of
katy's
trackage
rights
operation.
putting
aside
for
the
moment
the
fact
that
the
unions
never
demonstrated
that
they
had
any
railway
labor
act
rights
that
were
being
violated
by
the
katy's
crewing
decision,
the
court
below
failed
completely
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
the
application
of
railway
labor
act
procedures,
and
especially
the
fact
that
the
unions
may
strike
under
the
statute,
could
frustrate
the
implementation
of
every
rail
transaction
approved
by
the
commission.
the
most
pertinent
decision
to
this
case
on
that
score
is
the
eighth
circuit
decision
in
missouri
pacific
railroad
v.
united
transportation
union.
in
enjoining
the
utu
from
striking
the
missouri
pacific
in
an
effort
to
shut
down
katy's
trackage
rights
operations
at
issue
in
this
case,
in
that
decision,
the
eighth
circuit
found
it
inconceivable
that
congress
could
have
intended
that
a
labor
union
would
be
able
to
participate
in
an
icc
proceeding,
as
utu
did,
and
then,
if
dissatisfied
with
the
results
or
a
part
thereof,
strike
a
carrier
to
obtain
the
advantage
it
desired.
that
is
the
same
conclusion
reached
by
the
commission
in
its
october,
1983
decision
in
this
case,
when
it
specifically
found
that
its
approval
of
the
transactions
under
sections
11343
and
11344
necessarily
carries
with
it
an
exemption
from
the
railway
labor
act.
the
eighth
circuit
decision
again
in
missouri
pacific
v.
utu
refutes
any
argument
that
a
railway
labor
act
exemption
is
not
necessary
in
this
case.
in
its
opinion
enjoining
the
utu's
threatened
strike,
the
district
court
of
missouri
found
that
the
threatened
strike
of
utu
would
cause
irreparable
injury
to
missouri
pacific
and
to
thousands
of
shippers
that
it
serves.
the
eighth
circuit
reasoned
that
the
balance
and
efficiency
which
congress
sought
to
achieve
through
the
interstate
commerce
act
provisions
relating
to
rail
consolidations
would
be
essentially
and
materially
frustrated
if
employees
were
free
to
strike.
for
these
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
court
should
reverse
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
