mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
beginning
it
might
be
wise
to
go
back
to
the
jurisdictional
questions
that's
been
raised
here
in
the
arguments.
when
the
icc's
order...
and
that's
the
controlling
aspect...
is
looked
at,
the
order
shows
that
rail
labor's
position
was
what
the
order
imposed;
not
what
the
katy
and
the
missouri
pacific
several
months
later
said
the
order
meant.
the
icc's
order
that
was
issued
in
october
of
1932
said
that
the
trackage
right
application
of
the
katy
and
the
rio
grande
were
approved,
but
to
the
extent
specified
in
the
decision,
and
subject
to
the
conditions
for
the
protection
of
employees.
the
conditions
for
the
protection
of
employees,
as
required
by
11347
of
the
act,
specifically
required
two
things
that
are
relevant
to
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
one,
that
the
carriers,
in
consummating
the
transaction,
had
to
preserve
rates
of
pay,
rules,
and
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
the
employees.
and
they
shall
be
preserved
until
changed
by
applicable
statute
or
collective
bargaining.
secondly,
the
conditions
required
that
the
carriers...
all
carriers...
give
notice
to
all
interested
employees
who
might
be
affected
by
a
rearrangement
of
the
forces,
and
that
they
negotiate,
if
requested
by
the
unions,
what's
known
as
an
implementing
agreement.
the
implementing
agreement,
contrary
to
what
is
being
said
in
this
court
in
the
briefs...
and
just
as
a
matter
of
an
aside,
if
you'll
look
at
the
icc's
findings,
beginning
in
the
district
court...
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
on
their
petition,
and
then
finally
on
their
brief
and
their
reply
brief,
you'll
see
a
gradual
progression
into
firmness,
where
before,
in
front
of
the
district
of
columbia...
the
court
of
appeals
they
stated
that,
yes,
there
is
some
language
in
the
conditions
that
would
support
the
unions'
belief
that
all
carriers
had
to
participate
in
the
notice.
now
they
say,
we
don't
know
where
they
came
up
with
that
idea.
it's
incredible.
because
the
icc's
never
held
it.
they've
never
held
the
other
way.
and
the
district
court,
in
the
case
that
was
before
the...
that's
now
before
this
court
on
a
cert
petition
to
the
eighth
circuit
that's
still
pending,
in
that
case
the
district
court
found
that
the
icc
conditions
required
the
katy,
as
well
as
the
xx,
to
give
negotiating
rights
to
the
missouri
pacific
employees.
and
they
did
not.
and
the
reason
they
did
not
was
because
the
icc
found
in
the
may
18th
and
the
october
opinions
that
are...
that
were
subsequently
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
reason
they
did
not
was
because
the
icc's
order
granted
them
an
exemption
from
that
requirement
of
the
protective
conditions.
but
when
you
go
back
and
put
the
thing
in
its
proper
perspective,
what
you
have
in
this
case
is
an
order
of
the
commission
specifically
imposing
an
obligation...
limiting
the
applications
that
were
filed,
and
imposing
an
obligation
on
the
parties
to
consummate
those
transactions
in
compliance
with
those
orders,
with
the
employee
protective
conditions.
now,
implementing
agreements
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
are
not
to
implement
the
transaction,
as
the
icc
is
now
saying,
and
as
the
carriers
are
saying,
but
historically,
back
from
the
time
they
were
first...
the
requirement
was
first
imposed
back
in
1936
by
agreement,
implementing
agreements
are
to
do
two
things.
one,
to
apply...
and
this
right
in
article
4
of
the
current
provisions
right
now...
to
apply
the
basic
terms
and
protections
of
the
conditions,
the
protective
conditions,
to
the
particular
transaction.
the
transactions,
for
example,
give
an
employee
protection
against
being
required
to
relocate
without...
and
changing
his
residence
as
a
result
of
that.
the
question
of
what
is
a
change
of...
what
is
a
required
change
of
residence,
if
you
have
to
move
30
miles,
40
miles
or
50
miles,
is
that
a
required
change.
that's
a
subject
for
implementing
agreements,
and
it's
normally
devised...
decided
at
that
point.
there
are
no
claims
procedures
under
the
new
york
dock
conditions,
and
that's
what
an
implementing
agreement
does.
it
establishes
the
claims
procedure.
it
also
has
a
second
aspect,
and
that
is,
to
provide
the
basis
upon
which
the
selection
of
forces
will
be
made.
and
it
specifically
provides,
in
any
assignment
of
forces,
shall
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
agreement
as
to
the
selection
or
an
arbitration
decision.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
i
guess
i
got
to
go
back
to
it,
where
i
said
it...
the
interstate...
the
protective
condition
itself
does
not
authorize...
when
we're
talking
about
the
implementing
agreement...
it
does
not
authorize
the
abrogation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
because
the
implementing
agreement
requirement,
in
the
employee
protective
conditions,
provides
that...
has
two
bases.
one,
to
provide
for
the
application
of
those
terms
to
the
particular
transaction.
and
two,
to
provide
for
the
basis
upon
which
the
forces
to
perform
the
transaction
that's
involved
will
be
selected.
and
if
the
parties
can't
agree
on
that
selection
basis,
that
equity
ratio,
they
are
then
to
arbitrate
it.
that's
what
arbitrated.
and
you
have
to
view
that
arbitration
requirement
in
article
1,
section
4
along
with
the
requirement
in
article
1,
section
2,
that
they
preserve
collective
bargaining
agreements.
historically,
as
we've
shown
in
the
arbitration
decisions
attached
to
the
brief
by
the
utu,
the
commission's
decisions
have
not
been
viewed
as
abrogating
or
authorizing
the
abrogation
of
collective
bargaining
rights.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
ma'am.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
we
did.
we
did,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
one
thing
that's
being
ignored
in
this
case.
when
the
applications
were
filed
by
the
katy
and
the
rio
grande
for
the
trackage
rights,
rail
labor,
the
utu
in
particular
along
with
other
unions,
filed
an
opposition
to
that...
to
those
applications
and
said,
that
if
granted
as
requested
they
would
adversely
affect
employees'
interest.
and
we
asked
that
if
they're
approved,
that
they
be
approved
subject
to
employee
protective
conditions.
those
conditions
would
require,
as
the
commission
subsequently
imposed,
preservation
of
collective
bargaining
rights
and
a
voice
in
the
selection
of
the
forces.
so
rail
labor
asked
for
protection
if
those
applications
were
approved.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
we
did
not
directly
address
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
katy's
provisions
would
authorize
the
katy
to
implement
them
with
their
own
people
for
this--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
the
sticking--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--it
wasn't
lying
in
wait.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it
was
not
lying
in
wait,
your
honor,
because
the
commission's...
the
commission's
approval
said
that
the
applications
were
approved
subject
to
employee
protection.
this
is
something
that
has
cone
on
in
the
rail
industry
for
years.
this
case
is
comparable
to
the
texas
and
new
orleans
case
and
the
southern
railway
case.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
we
submit
they
would
not,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
since
the
time
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
first
given
the
authority
to
authorize
exemptions,
and
that
exemption
power
is
nothing
more
than
a
recognition
of
the
supremacy
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
over
the
economic
regulation
of
the
railroads,
it's
a
preemption
and
a
supremacy
provision,
from
that
time
when
congress
gave
the
icc
that
power,
it
also
was
regulating
rail
labor
relations
by
title
iii
of
the
1920
transportation
act.
regulation
of
labor
relations
is
separate
and
distinct
from
rail
economic
regulations
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
when
the
commission
authorizes
an
exemption,
it
can
only...
the
exemption
can
only
be
of
transactions
that
it
has
the
power
to
authorize,
or
the
jurisdiction
over.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
because
that
goes
to
the--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--the
problem...
that's
the
argument
that
comes
in
later.
they're
not
saying
that
rail
labor
has
a
veto
over
these
financial
transactions.
rail
labor
has
had
that
veto
from
1920
and
even
prior
to
that.
but
the
transactions
haven't
been...
thousands
of
transactions
have
been
authorized.
and
they
haven't
been
frustrated
by
a
right
to
strike.
the
right
to
strike...
and
the
need
to
strike
is
different
than
the
right
to
strike.
the
need
to
strike
only
comes
about
as
a
result
of
unilaterally
imposed
terms
being
imposed
on
the
employees,
as
has
occurred
here.
that
is
why,
since
1983,
you've
had
the
potential
strike
on
the
missouri
pacific
as
a
result
of
this;
you
had
the
potential
strike
on
the
milwaukee,
as
shown
in
the
cert
petitions;
you've
had
the
potential
strike
up
in
boston.
all
of
these
are
because
now
you
have
the
interstate
commerce
commission
saying
it
has
a
power
over
labor
relations.
but
since
1976,
if
there
was
any
question
on
that,
congress
has
taken
that
away,
by
specifically
saying,
in
the
1976
amendments,
that
from
that
date
forward,
all
merger
approvals
and
trackage
rights...
trackage
rights
approvals
have
to
include
provisions
that
do
two
things
among
others:
preserve
collective
bargaining
rights,
and
provide
for
the
implementing
agreements.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
we
submit
they
cannot,
your
honor.
and
that's
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
the
employee
protective
conditions
are
a
bridge,
as
mr.
ross
indicated,
between
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
financial
transaction.
the
railway
labor
act
deals
with
employer-employee.
the
financial
transactions
have
an
added
ingredient
to
it,
because
suddenly
you're
dealing
with
a
nonemployer
who
has
an
impact
on
the
transaction,
namely,
the
katy
coming
over
to
the
missouri
pacific.
you
need
a
bridge
to
give
the
missouri
pacific
employees
an
ability
to
talk
to
the
katy.
if
the
katy
wants
to
go
over
on
the
missouri
pacific
tracks,
it
has
to,
as
a
condition
of
that
approval,
that
right
of
receiving
that
right,
agree
to
talk
to
the
missouri
pacific
employees.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
because
what
you're
dealing
with
in
this
case...
and
to
take
it
out
of
the
theoretical
and
put
it
down
to
the
concrete...
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
transaction,
january
3rd,
when
the
katy
began
operations,
missouri
pacific
employees
performed
that
work.
now,
suddenly,
katy
employees
are
performing
that
work.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
employee
protective
conditions
would
most
likely
work
out
an
arrangement
that
would
give
the
other
carrier
all
the
rights,
because
it
has
the
equity
to
perform
the
work.
but
they're
still
talking
about
it.
now,
in
this
case,
the
missouri
pacific
employees
who
performed
the
work
as
of
january
3rd
or
january
6th
suddenly
stopped.
secondly,
the
missouri
pacific
employees
went
to
the
missouri
pacific
and
they
said,
negotiate
with
us
over
two
things:
one,
whether
or
not
the
katy
can
come
onto
the
property
and
leave
us
out
of
the
picture;
and
two,
negotiate
with
us
over
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
our
people
who
are
suddenly
affected
by
this
transaction.
and
the
missouri
pacific
said
we
can't
negotiate
with
you.
we
have
no
right
to
talk
to
you
because
the
icc's
order
gave
the
katy
the
authority
to
do
this.
and
we
can't
negotiate
with
you
about
that
because
we
can't
control
what
they
do.
but
that's
not
what
the
icc
order
said.
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
parties
then
began
to
take
the
diverging
paths.
when
it
became
clear
to
the
utu
that
the
missouri
pacific
would
not
negotiate,
they
voted
for
and
declared
a
strike.
when
it
became
clear
to
the--
icc
and
asked
the
icc
to
refute
what
the
katy
and
missouri
pacific
and
rio
grande
were
saying
the
icc's
order
meant.
because
the
past
practice
has
always
been,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
order,
even
if
the
carriers
put
in
the
order
in
the
application
what
they
intended
to
do,
that
did
not
bind...
or
that
did
not
become
part
of
the
order
of
the
commission.
and
that's
the
important
thing.
does
an
application
that
is
submitted
to
the
commission
that
says,
if
we're
granted
this
authority,
here's
how
we'll
do
it,
become
an
order
of
the
commission?
historically,
it
has
never
been
an
order,
because
the
carrier
does
not
have
to
do...
consummate
the
transaction
in
the
way
in
which
it
says,
in
its
application,
it
will
do
it.
if
it
says
in
the
application,
we're
going
to
use
one
train
crew
for
200
miles,
the
icc's
order
certainly
doesn't
exempt
that
carrier
from
the
hours
of
which
prohibit
12
hours
of
service
laws,
more
than
work.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
application
to
the
commission
is
nothing
more
than
a
general
blueprint
which
the
commission
then
uses
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
financial
transaction,
namely,
trackage
rights,
is
in
fact
within
the
public
interest.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,...
i
would
ask
that's
that
you
take
a
look
at
the
texas
and
new
orleans
case.
because
in
that
case,
the
carriers
did
exactly
what
they're
doing
here.
they
put
in
their
application
an
employment
contract
which
they
said
would
govern
the
consolidated
work.
and
the
fifth
circuit
said,
that's
not
what
five
two
allows
to
be
done,
and
then
went
into
xxx.
i'd
ask
you
to
take
a
look
at
the
southern
central
case,
because
in
that
case,
the
carrier
put
into
its
application
how
it
would
go
about
consolidating.
and
it
put
all
of
the
southern
people
on
the
rosters,
and
took
the
central
of
georgia
and
put
them
at
the
bottom.
and
the
commission
said
that
our
order
didn't
go
that
far.
you
go
back
and
you
take
a
look
at
the
arbitration
decisions
that
were
filed,
up
until
1983.
and
two
of
them
were
attached...
two
arbitration
decisions
were
attached
to
the
utu
brief.
one
of
them
was
a
pre-1983
decision
where
referee
xx
went
through
a
tremendous
history,
including
a
referee
fernstein
decision
under
the
washington
job
agreement,
where
they
specifically
said
that
the
conditions
did
not
give
the
right
to
abrogate
collective
bargaining
agreements.
they
were
separate
and
distinct.
