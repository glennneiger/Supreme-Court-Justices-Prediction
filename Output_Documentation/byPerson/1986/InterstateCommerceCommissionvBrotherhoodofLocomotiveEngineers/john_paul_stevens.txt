justice
stevens
--mr.
rush,
can
i
ask
just
one
question.
in
the
commission's
view,
when
did
the
exemption
from
the
railway
labor
act
take
place?
on
october
20,
when
the
original
transaction
was
approved,
or
later
on,
when
all
the
petitions
were
denied?
justice
stevens
you
don't
contend
that
the
exemption
became
effective
automatically
on
october
20,
1982?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
nothing
has
been
overturned
since
then.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
not
quite
right,
i
guess,
because...
well,
okay.
justice
stevens
mr.
clarke?
justice
stevens
can
i
ask
you
another
question?
supposing
in
october
of
1982,
all
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
had
here
in
this
court
and
since
then
were
fleshed
out
before
the
commission
at
that
time,
and
the
commission
said,
well,
we
think
we'll
change
the
policy
we've
followed
in
the
past,
and
with
respect
to
the
crew
assignments,
we
think
it
makes
sense,
a,
to
let
the
leasee
railroad
use
its
own
crews,
and,
b,
not
to
have
any
strikes
or
arbitration
over
that
issue,
and
that
is
what
we
intend,
and
so
forth.
would
they
have
had...
and
we
say,
we
further
find
that
it's
necessary
in
order
to
effectuate
the
consolidation
promptly
and
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
do
it
that
way...
would
they
have
had
statutory
authority
to
enter
that
order
at
that
time?
justice
stevens
you're
saying
they
had
a
statutory
duty
to
leave
open
the
question
of
who
would
crew
the
trains?
justice
stevens
even
though
it
might
result
in
a
strike
and
prolonged
arbitration?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
those
things
could
both
be
preserved
and
have
them
nevertheless
decide
who
will
crew
the
train?
justice
stevens
would
you
say
that
was
true
even
if
there
was
no
loss
of
employment
on
the
landlord
railroad?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
assuming
there's
no
loss
of
work
on
the
landlord
railroad.
just,
you
supplement
additional
operations
over
the
same
lines
at
different
times.
