mr.
harold
a.
ross
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
petitioners
state,
this
case
arises
out
of
a
petition
to
review
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
purported
to
automatically
exempt
the
participating
railroads
from
the
provisions
or
requirements
of
the
railway
labor
act
in
their
labor
contract.
the
case,
however,
involves
much
more
than
a
question
of
administrative
law.
and
as...
by
the
questions
of
the
court
today,
apparently
there
is
a
timeliness
question
that
also
arises.
however,
that
issue
was
presented
to
the
court
below.
it
was
only
an
oblique
reference
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
that
was
filed
in
the
case
by
the
government
in
regard
to
the
timeliness
issue.
and
that
only,
as
i
understand
it,
to
the
scope
of
the
commission's
order
or
what
had
been
presented
before
the
court
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
yes,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
harold
a.
ross
--however,
there
are
certain
exceptions
that
even
the
court
of
appeals
below
recognized
are
applicable.
for
example,
in
eagle-picher...
and
this
was
also
used
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
in
the
case...
that
the
instant
case
clearly
presents
a
situation
which
the
petitioners
claim
ripened
after
the
expiration
of
the
statutory
period
due
to
changed
circumstances
resulting
from
a
misleading
statement
of
position
by
the
icc.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
i
understand,
your
honor.
but
i'm
just
referring
to
the
fact
that
what
really
is
present
before
the
court
today
basically
gets
to
the
merit
of
the
case.
whether
the
court
should
enter
into
the
merits
of
the
case
is
determinative
about
what
the
commission's
past
practice
and
its
well-established
precedent
was
in
this
case.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
well,
your
honor,
the
thing
was
is
this,
that
it's
come
up
in
previous
decisions
of
the
court:
the
organizations,
the
employee
representatives,
had
no
idea
that
the
commission's
order
that
was
issued
in
october
of
1982
had
the
function
that
is
now
being
claimed
by
the
commission
that
it
had;
that
in
other
words
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
had
been
effectively
abrogated
by
the
commission's
decision.
all
past
precedent
that
the
commission
had
ever
issued
before
indicated
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
over
collective
bargaining
matters;
that
it
had
no
authority
in
labor
relations
matters.
rather
the
commission
even
as...
in
1977,
it
says
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction,
either
to
impose
crew
assignment
provisions
or
to
remove
crew
assignment
provision.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
but,
your
honor,
that
had
never
represented
what
actually
was
going
to
take
place.
in
every
previous
case
that
had
come
before
the
commission,
the
commission
merely
put...
approved
the
financial
transaction
between
the
railroads.
it
never
indicated
that
by
doing
that
that
it
was
making
employee
rearrangements.
and
it
always
said
that
it
wasn't
tampering
at
all
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
or
making
any
accommodation
insofar
as
to
the
employee
work
rights.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
yes,
your
honor.
for
example,
i
was
going
to
get
to
that,
this
court,
in
flea
v.
icc
in
1964,
remanded
the
southern
central
of
georgia
case
back
to
the
commission
because
the
commission
purportedly
had
not
inserted
sections
4,
5
and
9
of
the
washington
agreement
in
the
employee
protection.
and
when
it
went
back
to
the
commission
as
a
result
of
that,
the
commission
was
confronted
with
the
very
same
case
that
is
here
before
the
court
today.
the
southern
railway
in
that
case,
on
remand
to
the
commission,
said,
since
the
rearrangements
were
contained
in
our
initial
application,
that
means
that
the
commission's
approval
of
the
transaction
permitted
us
to
discharge
the
central
employees
and
give
all
of
the
jobs
to
the
southern
railway
employees.
further,
the
commission
said
at
that
time
that
as
a
result
of
that
the
carrier
was
not
required
to
give
notice
as
would
normally
be
required...
they
would
normally
be
required
to
do
under
section
4
of
the
washington
job...
or
the
commission-imposed
conditions,
which
at
that
time
were
the
new
orleans
conditions.
the
commission
said,
no,
you
have
to
file
notice.
you
have
to
give
notice
to
the
employee
organizations.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
is
that
when
we
imposed
the
condition,
we
did
not
make
any
rearrangements
of
work
forces.
we
didn't
do
anything
except
place
into
effect
the
monetary
conditions
for
the
protection
of
employees
who
might
be
displaced
or
dismissed;
and
also
provided
a
means
whereby
there
would
be
a
selection
and
allocation
of
work
forces.
which
meant,
in
effect,
that
the
parties
would
sit
down
and
negotiate,
after
a
certain
period
of
time
when
the
notice
had
been
served,
and
they
would
either
determine
the
equities,
or
if
they
were
unable
to
do
that,
that
that
would
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
and
that's
the
glue--
mr.
harold
a.
ross
--the
southern
railway
employees
would
have
all
of
the
jobs,
or
most
of
the
jobs.
it
specifically
stated
that.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
that
citation
is
at
331
icc
151,
and
the
discussion,
i
believe,
was
at
pages
165
through
173.
and
i
believe
that
at
page
165,
the
commission
mentioned
this
court's
decision
in
mclean
v.
u.s.,
an
antitrust
case,
in
which
the
commission
read
that...
and
i
believe
that
the
court's
decision
specifically
say
that
there
had
to
be
an
accommodation
between
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
antitrust
act,
that
it
didn't...
section
11341's
predecessor
did
not
automatically
exempt
the
railroad
from
the
antitrust
laws;
that
there
had
to
be
something
more
than
just
that.
the
commission
also
cited
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
texas
and
new
orleans
case,
which
they...
the
commission
said
required
it
to
achieve
some
type
of
accommodation
with
section
5
paren
11
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
was
the
predecessor
of
the
section
11341,
did
not
automatically
exempt
the
carrier
from
the
railway
labor
act
requirements
or
the
contracts
that
were
in
effect
at
that
time.
as
we
see
it,
your
honor,
actually
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
railway
labor
act
are
consistent
with
each
other;
that
the
bond
that
holds
the
two
acts
together
is
the
employee
protection;
that
the
only
thing
in
this
case
that
had
to
be
done
under
those
employee
protections
would
be
the
selection
and
allocation
of
work
forces.
and
as
i
indicated,
that
strictly
is
a
determination
as
to
the
equity
between
the
various
employee
groups
that
were
involved.
insofar
as
what
would
occur
after
that,
the
rates
of
pay,
where
the
home
terminal
and
away-from-home
terminal
would
be,
suitable
lodging
at
the
away-from-home
terminal,
or
those
kinds
of
matters,
those
would
be
dictated
by
the
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
as
we've
indicated,
consistently
throughout
60
years
of
the
icc
administering
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
railway
labor
act,
the
two
acts
have
existed
together.
congress
during
that
entire
period
has
regulated
labor
relations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1934,
14
years
after
the
predecessor
to
11341
was
enacted,
congress
enacted
the
railway
labor
act.
and
as
this
court
has
found
on
numerous
occasions,
that's
a
very
intricate
statute
that
sets
up
the
procedures
for
handling
labor
relations
in
the
railroad
industry.
and
even
though
that...
and
congress
went
further,
and
this
court
has
gone
farther,
that
the
section
2
rights
under
the
railway
labor
act
are
to
be
enforced
by
the
federal
courts;
that
major
disputes
are
to
be
governed
by
the
mediatory
services
of
the
national
mediation
board;
representation
disputes--
mr.
harold
a.
ross
--justice
o'connor,
it
was
our
understanding
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
heard
before
the
commission
that
the
commission
would
impose
certain
employee
protections.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
yes,
impose
certain
employee
protections
under
section
11347
of
the
interstate
commerce
act;
and
that
those
employee
protections
would
be
the
methods
by
which
the
rearrangements
of
forces
and
other
matters
that
are
now
before
the
court
today
would
be
handled.
when
i
filed
the
petition
for
clarification
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
i
thought
that
the
response
of
the
commission,
as
it
had
been
so
many
times
before,
in
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief,
would
be,
use
your
arbitration
procedures
under
the
employee
protective
conditions
or
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
no,
your
honor,
we
did.
we
thought
that
we
were
fully
protected.
we
thought
that
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
suggestions
in
the
applications
that
had
been
filed
by
the
trackage
right--
mr.
harold
a.
ross
--but
in
previous
cases,
justice
o'connor,
where
this
had
taken
place,
the
employee
protective
conditions
then
came
into
being;
the
railroad
served
its
notice
as
to
what
it
intended
to
do,
which
contained
the
so-called
rearrangements
or
the
employee
schedules
that
were
in
its
application
before
the
commission;
the
parties
sat
down
and
negotiated,
and
if
they
couldn't
agree
on
what
the
carrier
had
suggested
to
the
commission,
then
that
matter,
at
least
in
that
narrow
area
as
to
the
equities,
would
be
resolved
by
the
arbitrator.
and
there
are
several
arbitration
awards
which
were
attached
to
the
brief
of
the
united
transportation
union
in
this
case
which
shows
exactly
what
i'm
saying,
that
those
matters
as
to
what
collective
bargaining
agreements
would
apply,
or
what
the
equities
would
be,
had
been
handled
by
arbitrators
in
the
past,
and
therefore,
the
employees
in
this
case
had
no
idea
that
the
mkt
employees,
or
the
denver
&
rio
grande
employees
would
operate
the
trains
of
their
carriers
the
600
miles
or
so
over
the
missouri
pacific,
thereby
depriving
employees
of
the
missouri
pacific
of
work
that
they
had
handled
previously.
and
that's
the
understanding
that
we
had.
and
we
were
shocked
when
we
received
notice
from
the
missouri
pacific
that
it...
or
when
we
went
to
the
missouri
pacific
and
asked
why,
they
said,
we
don't
have
to
serve
the
notice
under
the
employee
protective
conditions.
we
don't
have
to
sit
down--
mr.
harold
a.
ross
--to
a
certain
extent--
mr.
harold
a.
ross
--now,
it
was
not,
your
honor,
because
of
the
basis
that
we
had
proceeded
on
before
the
commission,
believing
that
the
commission's
employee
protective
conditions
would
take
care
of
that
one
limited
area,
and
that
the
commission
was,
as
it
had
said
previously
like
in
the
southern
central
of
georgia
case,
that
its
decision
had
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
article
1,
section
2
of
the
conditions
that
had
been
imposed
by
the
commission
in
this
case
specifically
retains
the
rates
of
pay
rules,
working
conditions,
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
were
in
effect,
subsequent
to
being
changed
by
subsequent
collective
bargaining
agreements
or
by
statute.
and
therefore,
we
had
understood
that
those
agreements
would
continue
in
effect,
and
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem
in
regard
to
the
situation
that's
now
presented
to
the
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
thought
that
section
11341's
language,
which
says,
as
necessary
to
effectuate
the
transaction,
that
that
language
has
some
meaning.
as
we
find
out
now,
the
icc
some
20
years
later,
following
southern
central
of
georgia,
says,
that
that
is
superfluous
language.
that
really
is
not
necessary
at
all.
when
in
the
southern
central
of
georgia
case,
it
said
that
there
had
to
be
an
accommodation
between
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
in
regard
to
the
suggestion
that
this
court's
decision
in
schwabacher
v.
united
states
disposes
of
the
entire
case,
i
think
that
schwabacher...
which
arose
in
1948...
must
be
read
in
conjunction
with
this
court's
decision
in
burlington
truck
lines
v.
united
states,
where
the
court
said
that
the
commission,
when
it
got
into
labor
relations,
was
dealing
in
a
very
delicate
area;
and
therefore,
it
was
required
to
accommodate
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
the
railway
labor
act.
and
to
this
day,
the
commission
has
never
made
any
findings
in
regard
to
an
accommodation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
the
railway
labor
act
insofar
as
railroad
operating
employees
are
concerned.
it
has
never
made
any
study
as
to
the
economic
impacts
on
the
carriers--
mr.
harold
a.
ross
--yes,
your
honor.
if
we
look
at
section
11347,
which
provided
that
the
commission
was
required
to
impose
employee
protections
which
included
certain
protections
that
had
been
formulated
by
congress
in
the
rail
passenger
service
act,
a
combination
of
the
two--
mr.
harold
a.
ross
--no,
there's
no...
no.
they
did
impose
the
employee
protections.
but
there's
some
misunderstanding,
i
think,
in
regard
to
what
the
employee
protections
do.
i
gather
it's
felt
that
because
there
are
certain
monetary
benefits
that
are
specified
in
those
conditions,
that
that
takes
care
of
all
of
the
problems.
those
monetary
protections
take
care
of
the
displacements
and
the
dismissals.
but
also
those
employee
protections
do
more
than
that.
they
provide
for
certain
notices
that
have
to
be
served
on
the
employees;
and
for
other
functions
that
have
to
take
place.
and
that's
why
we're
trying
to
say,
your
honor,
that
the
employee
protections
are
the
clue
between
the
two
acts;
and
that
when
you
read
them
correctly,
this
whole
undertaking
can
be
resolved,
and
requires
an
affirmance
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
