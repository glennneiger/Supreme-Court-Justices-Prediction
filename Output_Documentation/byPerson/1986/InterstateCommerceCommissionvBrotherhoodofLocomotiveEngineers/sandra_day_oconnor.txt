justice
o'connor
mr.
rush,
did
the
respondents
in
this
case
raise
their
argument
about
their
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
before
the
icc
at
its
hearings
on
the
merger?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
is
it
that
they
can
raise
them
later?
raise
that
argument
later?
justice
o'connor
why
aren't
they
precluded
from
doing
that?
justice
o'connor
you
took
the
position
that
it
was
perfectly
all
right
for
them
to
come
in
later
and
raise
the
issue;
is
that
it?
justice
o'connor
exactly.
so
it
may
turn
on
timeliness,
when
they
can
raise
it.
if
they
didn't
raise
it
then,
why
can
they
now?
it
just...
i
don't
understand.
justice
o'connor
mr.
rush,
if
the
respondents
had
raised
the
issue
of
their
collective
bargaining
rights
during
the
original
icc
hearings
on
the
merger,
would
the
agency
have
considered
them,
the
icc?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
respondents
seem
to
be
suggesting
that
had
they
done
so
they
wouldn't
have
been
heard.
and
i
wondered
what
your
position
was.
justice
o'connor
are
there
any
limits
as
to
what
the
icc
can
exempt
under
this
statute?
or
does
the
exempted
action
have
to
be
germane
to
the
transaction?
justice
o'connor
but
mr.
manson,
what
did
the
statement
in
the
icc
labor
protective
conditions,
to
the
effect
that
collective
bargaining
rights
shall
be
preserved,
mean?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
wasn't
the
commission's
order
qualified
then?
you
say
that
the
statement
doesn't
mean
literally
what
it
says,
that
not
all
collective
bargaining
rights
are
preserved.
so
why
wasn't
it
qualified?
justice
o'connor
mr.
ross,
may
i
just
ask
you
to
clarify
for
a
minute
why
you
didn't
ask
in
the
original
proceedings
that
the
icc
specifically
eliminate
the
part
of
the
application
that
had
to
do
with
the
crews
on
trackage
rights?
justice
o'connor
that
the
commission
would?
justice
o'connor
if
you
thought
what
the
commission
had
actually
done
didn't
protect
you,
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
appealed
right
away?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
wasn't
a
suggestion.
it
just
stated
flat
out
that
was
what
they
were
going
to
do.
you
knew
what
they
were
going
to
do
from
reading
the
application.
justice
o'connor
i
guess
behind
this
whole
thing
is
your
view
that
somehow
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
gave
the
union
you
represent
the
right
to
have
its
crews
used?
justice
o'connor
does
the
record
show
what
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provided?
has
that
ever
been
furnished
or
attached?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
clarke,
i
still
don't
understand,
if
you're
right
that
the
icc
just
doesn't
have
authority
to
upset
these
collective
bargaining
rights,
and
if
you
read
in
the
application
what
the
intention
of
the
merging
railroads
was
with
regard
to
the
crews,
you
could
see
for
yourself
that
that
was
not
in
accord
with
your
view.
justice
o'connor
why,
then,
wouldn't
you
have
gone
into
the
icc
hearing
initially
and
said,
eliminate
that
from
the
application?
justice
o'connor
but
did
you
directly
address
the
crew
trackage
right
problem?
justice
o'connor
and
yet
it
was
perfectly
clear
in
the
application
was
intended.
justice
o'connor
that
is
the
sticking
point.
justice
o'connor
that
you
should
be
able
to
lie
in
wait--
justice
o'connor
--seeing
this,
and
then
come
in
later;
that's
the
point.
