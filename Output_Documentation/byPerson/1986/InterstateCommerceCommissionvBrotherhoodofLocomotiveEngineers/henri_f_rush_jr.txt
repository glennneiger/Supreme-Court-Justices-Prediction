mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
the
federal
agency
charged
with
implementing
what
this
court
has
recognized
on
a
number
of
occasions
to
be
a
national
policy
favoring
consolidation
of
the
railroads
in
the
interests
of
improving
the
economy
and
efficiency
of
their
operation.
the
commission
is
also
charged
with
implementing
the
congressional
structure
established
to
promote
the
privately
initiated
transactions
being
presented
in
a
single
forum
for
a
fair
but
expeditious
proceeding.
this
case
involves
the
consequences
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
approval
of
a
railroad
consolidation
transaction.
the
statutory
provision
primarily
implicated
is
49
u.s.c.
11341(a),
which
provides
in
relevant
part
that
a
carrier
participating
in
an
approved
transaction,
quote,
is
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
from
all
other
laws,
as
necessary,
to
let
that
person
carry
out
the
transaction,
end
of
quote.
the
commission,
with
the
approvals
of
the
courts,
over
a
long
period
of
time,
has
interpreted
that
section
to
be
self-executing,
which
is
to
say
that
individuals
desiring
to
consummate
a
transaction,
negotiate
their
deal,
and
bring
it
to
the
commission
for
a
proceeding
in
which
all
persons
with
the
many
and
varied
conflicting
interests
that
arise
in
these
transactions
are
permitted
to
make
their
case
before
the
commission.
the
commission,
upon
the
record
made
at
that
time,
determines
whether
the
transaction
is,
or
can
be
made
to
be,
consistent
with
the
public
interest,
and
approves,
disapproves,
or
conditionally
approves
that
transaction.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
they
did
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
the
guise,
if
you'll--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--well,
the
court
below
held
that
they
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
the
commission
had
improperly
failed
to
clarify
at
the
request
of
the
petitioners.
we
did
not
argue
that
they
did
not
have
what
i
would
call
the
limited
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
that
denial
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
majority
of
the
court
then
went
on--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--no,
that's
not
our
position
at
all.
but
in
terms
of
the
question
of
how
the
court
was
able
to
address
it,
that's
the
way
the
court
was
able
to
address
it.
our
position
is
that
all
of
the
arguments
ought
to
be
raised
at
the
time
of
initial
consideration
of
the
transaction.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
an
argument
can
be
made
for
waiver
of
rights
not
raised
at
the
proper
time
before
the
agency's
procedure.
and
that
was
one
of
the
arguments,
of
course,
that
we
raised
before
the
court
below.
at
the
same
time--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--that's
correct,
judge
scalia.
but
at
the
same
time--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--well,
our
view
of
jurisdiction
is
that
there
was
at
least
jurisdiction
in
the
lower
court
to
determine
whether
the
commission
abused
its
discretion
by
refusing
the
clarify
its
earlier
ruling.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
right,
correct.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
both
the
petition
for
clarification
and
the
petition
to
reconsider.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
it
was
embraced
within
the
denial
of
the
petition
to
reconsider,
it
seems
to
me,
because
clearly,
upon
denying
the
petition
to
reconsider,
the
initial
petition
would
be
in
issue.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
that's
correct,
except
viewed
as
an
administrative
appeal,
it
has
also
been
held
that
a
properly
filed
administrative
appeal...
which
is
what
we
deem
the
two
petitions
to
reconsider
the
denial
of
clarification
to
be...
tolls
that
period
and
commences
it
running
at
the
time
of
the
denial
of
the
administrative
appeal.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
it
commences
the
time
running
for
seeking
judicial
review,
much
as
denial
of
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
a
lower
court
starts
the
time
for
seeking
certain--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--no,
no,
no.
of
the
denial
of
clarification.
we've
contended
all
along
that
all
that
was
open
to
the
court
was
denial
of
clarification.
the
question
of
whether--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--it
may,
if
i
understood
your
question,
that
a
properly
filed
petition
for
reconsideration
was
filed
with
the
agency.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
within
the
time
limit.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
that...
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
are
not
included
in
our
brief,
i
regret
to
say,
that
address
that
issue.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
there
are
other
cases
that
do
address
that,
and
have
in
fact
held
that
the
time
commences
from
the--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--i
will
supply
them
to
the
court.
i'm
sorry
i
don't
have
them.
and
at
the
commission
we
have
acquiesced
in
that
interpretation
for
the
last,
about,
eight
years.
now,
i
understand
the
question,
the
ripeness
issue,
as
being
another
issue
that
you're
very
concerned
with,
and
so
are
we.
and
eagle-picher,
we
think,
will
improve
things
greatly
in
review
of
our
decisions,
particularly
in
cases
like
this,
where
the
issue
certainly
ought
to
have
been
foreseen,
because
the
parties,
the
mkt
here,
and
the
drgw,
explicitly
requested
the
right
to
crew
with
their
own
crews
under
the
trackage
rights
that
were
being
granted.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
made
the
60-day
period,
for
appeal
of
that
denial
of
clarification,
run
from
the
date
the
administrative
appeal
is
denied.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
look
at
the
d.c.
circuit
case
shortly
after
that
very
provision
was
passed.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
we
have
not
so
interpreted
it.
we've
interpreted
it
to
mean
that
you
cannot
be
required
to
seek
an
administrative
appeal.
you
can
go
directly
to
court.
but
should
you
choose
to
file
an
administrative
appeal,
that
your
time
to
go
to
court
runs
from
60
days
after
that
appeal
is
dealt
with.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
yes,
i'm
sure
it
is,
justice
black.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
but
on
a
very
narrow
ground.
we
initially
moved
to
dismiss,
and
the
court
then
took
the
issue,
in
part
i
presume
because
of
the
suggestion
that
we
might
be
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
have
addressed
the
question
of
the
relation
between
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
yes,
we
very
much
do,
having
exerted
this
much
time
and
effort
in
the
case
to
date;
and
i
believe
that
the
respondents
want
the
same
thing.
we
want
vastly
different
rulings.
but
nonetheless,
a
ruling
seems
very
much
necessary
to
guide
the
parties
for
the
future
in
these
matters.
and
there
are
innumerable
matters
pending,
as
we've
noted
in
our
petition
for
the
writ.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
no,
i--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--i
think
that
very
much
as
with
a
rule,
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
from
the
d.c.
circuit
on
that,
that
rather
than
go
to
court
with
an
untimely
challenge,
you
can
ask
the
agency
to
amend,
reconsider,
in
this
case
clarify--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--well,
we
believe,
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
that
an
eagle-picher
analysis
can
and
should
be
applied
to
whether
that
request
for
clarification
is
proper.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
they
can,
and
unquestionably,
should
have
been.
the
issue
is--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--well,
of
course,
eagle-picher
has
been...
not
been
applied
retroactively,
if
you
will,
when
this
case
was
in
the
pipeline.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
that's
very
correct.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
i
have
no
doubt
they
would
have,
justice
o'connor.
i
mean,
that's
the
point
of
having
all
of
the
matters
in
tension
presented
at
one
time.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
i
think
they
have
absolutely
no
basis
for
that
assertion.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
the
icc
does
not
exempt.
that
is
a
critical
aspect
of
the
case.
the
icc
approves,
and
the
statute
exempts.
but
yes,
certainly,
the
exemption
effected
by
the
statute
could
raise
an
issue
of
germaneness
to
the
transaction.
and
in
that
context,
perhaps
palestine
revisited
would
come
out
differently
if,
in
that
case,
that
had
been
a
central
aspect
of
the
merger
as
crewing
was
here.
instead,
in
that
case,
the
situation
was
that
they
said,
since
you're
approving
the
merger,
by
the
way
can
you
get
us
out
of
this
agreement
that
we're
not
very
fond
of.
and
we
said,
sure,
ignore
it.
but
had,
for
example,
the
consolidation
of
yards,
of
which
palestine
was
one,
been
a
public
benefit
associated
with
the
merger,
i
think
you'd
get
a
very
different
analysis.
and
i
think
that's
what,
in
essence,
is
involved
here.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
i
had
hoped
to
reserve
some
time.
but
the
issue
on
the
merits
seems
to
be
very
simply
the
question
of
the
commission's
approval
of
the
transaction
effecting
a
statutory
exemption
from
all
other
laws
and
impediments
to
the
carrying
out
of
the
transaction.
and
the
problems
presented
are
classically
illustrated
by
the
case
here,
where
a
condition
which
the
commission
imposed
upon
its
approval
of
one
of
the
most
significant
rail
mergers
ever
approved
by
it
has
been
thrown
into
doubt
and
left
open
with
a
cloud
hanging
over
it
for
three,
close
to
four,
years.
the
commission
approved
it
in
1982,
and
that
approval
was
affirmed
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
1983.
hence
we
believe
that
unless
the
view
expressed
by
the
commission
is
carried
out
here,
the--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--i
would
think
when
the
commission's
approval
had
withstood
judicial
review,
sir.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
does,
subject
to
being
overturned,
if
some
aspect
of
the
decision
is
overturned
on
reviewed.
so
yes,
i
would
think
that
the
commission's
approval
causes
the
statute
to
exempt
the
transaction.
but
that
if
some
aspect
of
that
approval
is
subsequently
overturned
or
modified,
then
the
extent
of
the--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--no,
it
has
not.
so
that
it--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--in
the
context
of
this
case,
my
answer
would
be
that
it
took
place
in
1982
when
the
commission
approved
the
transaction.
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
there's
so
much
i
disagree
with
mr.
clarke
on
that
it's
hard
to
know
where
to
start.
but
i
think
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
issue
is
the
question
of
commission
approval,
and
the
effect
that
it
has
in
connection
with
the
employee
protection
conditions.
first,
i
would
note
that
in
every
case
cited
to
you
by
rail
labor,
they
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
combining
consolidating
carriers
themselves.
in
this
case,
that
would
be
the
missouri
pacific,
the
union
pacific
and
the
western
pacific.
the
missouri
pacific,
the
union
pacific
and
the
western
pacific
have
honored
the
employee
protection
conditions
as
to
rearrangement
of
forces,
including
the
displacements
resulting
from
their
acquiescing
in
the
condition
imposed
by
the
commission
that
the
katy
and
the
<drgw>
[=
drgw]
be
permitted
to
operate
trackage
rights
utilizing
their
own
crews.
there
is
no
case
anywhere
holding
that
in
the
context
of
an
imposed
condition,
or
even
in
the
context
of
a
trackage
rights
situation,
where
the
commission
has
looked
at
a
term
and
deemed
it
to
be
a
material
term,
that
rla
rights
continue
to
exist.
and
the
reason
that
there
has
never
been
a
disputation
on
this
is
that
until
this
case,
labor
has
never
asserted
that
right.
turning
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
asked
about
what
does
the
commission
guarantee
of
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements
mean,
and
coupling
that
with
the
other
observation
made
that
in
1976
with
the
amendment
to
11347
congress
intended
to
require
that
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements
be
preserved
and
kicked
over
into
the
rla,
the
commission's
provisions,
as
the
commission
explained,
preserve
collective
bargaining
simply
to
the
extent
of
the
approved
transaction.
if
i
may
finish
this
sentence
on
the
11347
amendment,
the
amtrak
agreements
which
were
required
to
be
incorporated
were
added
to
ensure
that
all
collective
bargaining
would
not
be
eliminated
because
the
railroads
were
transferring
their
operations
to
a
semi-public
federally
funded
operation.
