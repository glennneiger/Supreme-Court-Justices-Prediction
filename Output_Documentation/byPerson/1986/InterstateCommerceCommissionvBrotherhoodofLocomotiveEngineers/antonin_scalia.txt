justice
scalia
it
isn't
just
that.
it
isn't
just
not
raising
before
the
agency.
it's
not
filing
an
appeal
within
60
days
under
the
hobbes
act,
as
they're
supposed
to.
justice
scalia
so
how
do
you
get
around
that
here?
and
that's
jurisdictional,
so
you
really
shouldn't
be
talking
to
the
merits
if
we
don't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
scalia
okay,
now
how
is
that?
the
commission
denied
the
petition
to
clarify,
right?
justice
scalia
then
there
was
filed
a
petition
to
reconsider
the
denial
of
the
petition
to
clarify,
right?
justice
scalia
and
the
appeal
that
we
have
before
us
is
from
that
denial
of
the
petition
to
reconsider,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
was
an
appeal
filed
from
the
petition
to
clarify?
justice
scalia
it's
not
what
the
statute
reads
like.
49
u.s.
c
10327(g)
says
that
an
interested
party
may
petition
to
reopen
and
reconsider
an
action
of
the
commission
under
regulations
of
the
commission.
but
goes
on
to
say
that,
notwithstanding
this
subtitle,
an
action
of
the
commission
under
this
section
is
final;
that
is,
the
denial
of
the
petition
to
clarify,
is
final
on
the
date
on
which
it
is
served.
and
a
civil
action
to
enforce,
enjoin,
suspend
or
set
aside
the
action
may
be
filed
after
that
date.
so
the
hobbes
act
60
days
would
have
begun
running
when
the
petition
to
clarify
was
denied,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
a
petition
to
reconsider
stays
the...
tolls
the
running
of
the
hobbes
act?
justice
scalia
judicial
review
of
what?
of
the
original
order?
justice
scalia
why
was
that
even
open?
why
was...
let's
do
it
more
simply.
let's
assume
you
have
an
ordinary
icc
order,
in
a
rate-making
or
any
other
proceeding.
sixty
days
have
gone
by.
within
those
60
days,
a
petition
for
reconsideration
is
filed.
then
the
60-day
time
limit
expires.
then
the
petition
for
reconsideration
is
decided.
no
appeal
has
been
filed
in
the
interim.
may
an
appeal
now
be
taken
from
the
original
order?
justice
scalia
within
the
60
days?
justice
scalia
and
then
the
60
days
expire.
that's
not
how
the
hobbes
act
reads.
justice
scalia
it's
not
what
eagle-picher
says.
it's
not
what
any
d.c.
circuit
case
says
that
i'm
aware
of.
in
fact,
the
d.c.
circuit
has
advised
the
icc
practitioners
explicitly
that
they
should
file
the
motion
for
reconsideration
with
the
agency,
and
simultaneously
file
an
appeal
to
protect
their
rights,
because
the
motion
for
reconsideration
does
not
preserve
the
60-day
period.
justice
scalia
well,
i'd
like
to
know
what
they
were.
could
you--
justice
scalia
--let
me
make
sure
i
understand
your
argument
now.
we
had
here
the
denial
of
the
petition
to
clarify,
all
right.
justice
scalia
and
your
argument
is
that
the
petition
to
reconsider
the
denial,
what,
tolls
the
60-day
period
as
long
as
that
petition
is
pending,
the
60-day
period
is
tolled?
justice
scalia
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
statute
that
says,
notwithstanding
the
ability
to
file
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
notwithstanding
it,
an
action
of
the
commission
under
this
section
is
final
on
the
date
in
which
it
was
served,
and
a
civil
action
to
enforce
or
suspend
it
may
be
filed
after
that
date?
justice
scalia
it
may
be
filed.
it
must
be
filed
for
purposes
of
statutory
limitation
purposes.
justice
scalia
so
long
as
the
appeal
is
filed
within
the
60
days?
justice
scalia
one
more
question.
we've
just
been
talking
about
filing
the
reconsideration
for
the
petition
to
clarify.
okay,
the
petition
to
clarify
itself
was
filed
more
than
60
days
after
the
original
decision
here
was
rendered,
right?
justice
scalia
so
your
theory
would
not
even
cover
that?
justice
scalia
how
do
you
enable
us
to
get
into
the
merits
of
the
original
order
on
the
basis
of
the
petition
to
clarify?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
all
you
need
to
get
around
the
60
days
of
the
hobbes
act?
just
file
a
petition
to
clarify,
and
then
the
60
days
can
be
extended
indefinitely?
justice
scalia
well,
how
does
it
work
out
here?
why
couldn't
all
of
the
points
raised
in
that
petition
for
clarification,
which
is
really
more
like
a
petition
for
reconsideration,
it
seems
to
me,
why
couldn't
all
of
them
have
been
made
at
the
time
of
the
original
proceeding,
or
urged
before
a
court
within
60
days
after
the
original
proceeding?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
the
end
of
it
then,
as
far
as
eagle-picher
is
concerned,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
saying.
you
mean
it
preserves
collective
bargaining
rights
except
with
respect
to
those
matters
that
are
specifically
disposed
of
by
the
agreements?
justice
scalia
it's
jurisdictional
though,
isn't
it?
isn't
the
hobbes
act
jurisdictional?
justice
scalia
well,
if
that's
the
case,
the
parties
simply
by
agreeing
not
to
raise
it
can't
confer
jurisdiction
on
us,
can
they?
justice
scalia
but
the
merger
agreements
it
approved
specifically
said
that
the
railroads
would
or
might
use
their
own
crews.
those
were
the
agreements
that
were
approved.
justice
scalia
had
all
these
other
ones
contained
specific
provisions
like
that
where
the
railroads
said
that
they
would
use
their
own
crews?
justice
scalia
that's
the
case
in
which
the
consolidation
agreement
said
specifically
that--
justice
scalia
--what
is
the
citation...
is
that
the
only
example
that
you
have
of
how
the
commission
previously
has
written
opinions
like
this
that
didn't
mean
what
they
appear
to
me
to
mean
on
their
face?
justice
scalia
what's
the
best
way
for
us
to
satisfy
ourselves
that
his
indeed
been
the
practice?
