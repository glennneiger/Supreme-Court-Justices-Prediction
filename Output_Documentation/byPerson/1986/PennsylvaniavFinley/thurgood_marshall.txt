that
should
have
been
raised?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
judge
went
through
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no.
he
did
go
through
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
there's
nothing
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
there
were
86
eyewitnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
make
the
same
argument,
if
there
were
86
eyewitnesses
who
testified
that
this
person
committed
the
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
leave
me
off
at
85?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
do
with
another
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
uh-huh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that...
go
ahead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
do
you
think
anders
says?
that
the
lawyer
has
to
file
a
brief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
has
to
say
more
than
he
said
in
that
letter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
do--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--what
would
you
do
if
the
client
said
that
my
ground
for
appeal
was
that
i
was
sentenced
on
count
two
before
i
was
sentenced
on
count
one;
and
that's
the
only
grounds
that
i
have
for
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
warn
you
in
advance
that
there's
an
actual
case
that
that
happened.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
would
you
do
in
that
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this
letter
here,
except
that
it
doesn't
have
all
the
detail
in
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
case,
is
it--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--is
it
true
that
her
only
defense
was
an
alibi?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
you
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
raise
that
her
defense
was
an
alibi.
you
put
that
in
footnote
7.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
are
bound
by
that,
aren't
we?
