william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-2099,
pennsylvania
against
finley.
mrs.
barthold,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
pennsylvania
has
control
of
that
in
its
own
hands.
it
can
simply
stop
affording
counsel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
barthold.
we'll
now
hear
from
you,
ms.
harper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
think
the
constitutional
basis
of
the
anders
case
is,
ms.
harper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
just
read
the
opinion
and
i
had
a
hard
time
figuring
out
what
the
basis
for
the
right
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
ms.
harper,
i
didn't
see
any
reference
to
due
process
in
the
anders
opinion.
there's
certainly
reference
to
the
sixth
amendment,
to
equal
protection.
but
the
anders
opinion
itself
isn't
grounded
on
the
view
that
you
can't
withdraw
an
attorney
because
of
due
process
considerations,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
harper.
ms.
barthold,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
barthold.
the
case
is
submitted.
