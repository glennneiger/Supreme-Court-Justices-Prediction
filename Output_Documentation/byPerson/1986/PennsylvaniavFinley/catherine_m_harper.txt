ms.
catherine
m.
harper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
let
me
address
ms.
barthold...
some
of
the
issues
that
she
had
raised,
before
getting
into
my
argument.
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
in
this
case
my
client
told
me
that
she
never
received
that
letter.
since
we
didn't
get
the
hearing
that
the
superior
court
had
awarded
to
us,
that's
a
question
of
evidence
that
is
still
open.
i
would
argue
that
she
didn't
receive
the
notice
that
was
required
under
anders
in
this
case.
secondly,
the
district
attorney
repeatedly
characterized
collateral
review
as
three
or
four
steps
removed
from
the
actual
trial.
that's
not
exactly
accurate.
in
pennsylvania,
as
i
would
imagine
in
most
jurisdictions,
the
only
issues
which
can
be
raised
in
the
higher
courts
are
those
which
were
raised
in
post
trial
motions.
therefore,
we're
actually
one
step
removed,
if
you
consider
that
there
was...
if
there
was
an
issue
that
was
not
raised
in
post
trial
motions,
neither
the
superior
court
nor
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
had
that
issue
before
it
when
they
were
deciding
the
direct
appeal.
thirdly,
i'd
like
to
note
that
the
district
attorney
points
to
this
case
as
a
case
of
fundamental
fairness.
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
what
happened--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--i
don't
believe
it's
a
matter
of
what
could
have
been
raised.
i
think
the
pcha
says
that
matters
that
were
already
litigated
to
a
final
determination
are
barred.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
and
on
appeal.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
the
distinction
i'm
drawing,
justice,
is
not...
is
between
issues
that
were
raised
and
which
could
have
been
raised.
i
believe
pennsylvania--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--only
through
the
back
door.
you'd
have
to
argue,
your
honor,
that--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--exactly.
you'd
have
to
argue
that
the
counsel
on
appeal
was
ineffective
for
failing
to
raise
that
earlier.
and
then
you
could
get
to
it.
yes,
justice
marshall?
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
well,
justice
marshall,
i
believe
in
my
brief,
at
footnote
7,
i've
listed
several
issues
of
arguable
merit.
but
i
don't
believe
that
anders
requires
me
to
show
prejudice
at
this
stage.
and
i
would
ask
this
court
not
to
put
that
burden
on
me.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
the
pcha
court
says
that
they...
yes,
the
court
went
through
the
record.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
yes,
your
honor.
my
problem
is,
your
honor,
that
on
collateral
review,
court
appointed
counsel
should
look
beyond
the
record;
should
not
only
scour
the
record
to
determine
whether
there
are
issues
that
should
have
been
raised,
but
should
also
consult
with
the
petitioner,
and
should
perhaps
even
look
into
investigation
beyond
that
based
on
whatever
the
petitioner
tells
him
is
there.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
if
there's
nothing
there,
which
is
not
this
case,
your
honor,
he
should
follow
anders.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
your
honor,
that's
a
tough
question.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
i
guess
you're
asking
me
whether
there
is
a
case
where
there
are
no
arguable--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--i
would
make
the
argument
that
anders
applies.
i
would
not
have
the
liberty
or
good
grace
to
be
able
to
say
that
there
are
issues.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
but
i
would
make
the
argument
that
anders
applies,
and
one
should
file
an
anders
brief.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
and
in
this
case--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--yes,
i
will,
your
honor.
the
argument
of
the
respondent
basically
is
that
since
pennsylvania
does
provide
a
post
conviction
hearing
act
procedure,
and
it
does
provide
counsel,
and
it
explicitly
provides
effective
counsel,
that
when
counsel
seeks
to
withdraw
from
a
pcha
petition,
then
due
process
considerations
come
into
play.
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
you
can't
arbitrarily
deprive
a
petitioner
of
counsel
without
following
due
process.
when
counsel
seeks
to
withdraw,
due
process
means
the
anders
procedure.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
i
believe
that
anders
does
rest
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel
in
that
case;
but
i
don't
think
it
was
necessary
for
the
holding.
i
think
that
this
court
obviously
handed
down
that
case,
knowing
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
but
that's
not
really
discussed
in
the
opinion,
and
i
can
only
assume--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--well,
i
didn't
see
it
discussed
there
explicitly
either,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
simply
assumed
that
it
was
a
right.
now,
the
question
is,
what
do
we
do
when
the
counsel
wants
to
withdraw,
assuming
the
right
exists.
which
is
the
same
in
this
case.
i'm
not
arguing
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
an
attorney
on
collateral
review,
because
i
don't
have
to.
there
is
a
very
clear
pennsylvania
right
to
a
lawyer,
and
to
an
effective
lawyer.
conversely,
the
no
merit
letter
that--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--i
guess
pennsylvania
could
give
that
limited
right,
and
the
question
would
be
whether
that
limited
right
is
entitled
to
due
process;
am
i
understanding
you
correct?
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
that
were
the
pennsylvania
practice.
but
this
is
not...
that's
not
pennsylvania
practice.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
first
of
all,
the
pennsylvania
statute
explicitly
calls
for
counsel.
secondly,
there's
a
criminal
rule
for
civil...
a
rule
of
criminal
procedure
that
calls
for
counsel,
and
there's
case
law
that
says,
the
right
to
counsel
means
the
right
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
not
only
to
make
arguments,
but
also
to
marshall
the
facts
and
go
through
th
record
and
see
what
else
might
be
there.
for
that
reason,
even
petitioners
who
raise...
who
draft
their
own
petitions
and
name
things
that
have
already
been
litigated
on
a
first
pcha
are
entitled
to
counsel,
the
reasoning
being
not
only
that
they're
entitled
to
an
advocate,
but
also
because
an
attorney
can
better
explore
the
issues.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
that's
correct.
i
think
that
you
cannot
withdraw
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
without
due
process.
so
i
think
that
that
would
contemplate
that
there
might
be
a
constitutional
issue
raised
if
counsel
were
very
ineffective.
it's
not
necessary
to
get
to
that,
though,
because
pennsylvania's
own
collateral
review
procedure
provides
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
questions
to
be
raised
right
in
our
commonwealth
courts,
and
to
be
taken
care
of
there.
for
that
reason
i'd
also
take
issue
with
the
idea
that
applying
anders
in
collateral
review
cases
would
clog
the
courts.
i
think,
on
the
contrary,
applying
anders
in
these
cases
would
make
sure
that
the
court
more
readily
reached
the
merits
of
the
case,
and
if
it
is
frivolous,
got
rid
of
it.
rather
than...
of
have
a
no
merit
letter,
which
i
think
would
encourage
the
petitioner
to
go
to
the
federal
courts
with
a
habeas
petition
saying
that
they
weren't
dealt
with
fairly.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that...
my
argument
in
the
alternative
is
that
it
rests
on
independent
and
adequate
state
grounds.
i
think
that
the
pennsylvania
court
did
not
feel
compelled
to
apply
anders,
but
merely
applied
anders
because
it's
a
very
sane,
fair,
humane
approach
to
this
problem,
and
because
pennsylvania
has
had
20
years
experience
with
anders;
because
very
shortly
after
this
court
handed
down
anders,
it
was
applied
in
pennsylvania
in
direct
appeal
cases.
so
the
pennsylvania
courts
are
familiar
with
it;
had
20
years
practice
with
it;
and
the
opinion
indicates
that
pennsylvania
law
is
derived
from
anders,
but
it
doesn't
say
it's
constitutionally
compelled
by
it.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
scalia.
and
i
point
out
that
it
also
relies--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--no,
i
would
not.
i
think
it's
very
clear.
i
perhaps
would
wish
for
a
better
scrivener
of
the
opinion.
but
i
think
it's
better
clear
that
"derived
from"
is
different
from
"is
constitutionally
compelled
by".
i
don't
think
this
opinion
indicates
that
it...
that
the
court
felt
compelled
by
the
federal
courts
to
do
this.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this...
i
think
this
opinion's
clear.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
this
is
a
pennsylvania
law,
is
derived
from,
is
what
it
says.
thank
you.
but
it
also
points
to
criminal
rules
of
procedure
in
its
opinion--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--that
is
what
michigan...
that
is
what
michigan
v.
long
says.
apparently
justice
scalia
and
i
have
a
disagreement
on
whether
or
not
it's
clear.
i
think
the
opinion
is
clear
that
it
relies
on
pennsylvania
law.
i
kept
trying
to
say
that--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--well,
then,
if
you
disagree
with
me,
it's
not
necessary
to
find
that
this
rests
on
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds.
then
i
go
back
to
my
due
process
argument.
if
a
state
grants
an
important
right,
the
state
can't
willy-nilly
take
it
away
without
providing
due
process.
anders
is
the
measure
of
due
process
for
withdrawing
attorneys.
so
it's
not
necessary
to
find
that
this
rests
on
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
it
wasn't
necessary
in
anders,
because
it
rested...
arguably
rested
on
a
constitutional
right.
it
wasn't
necessary
to
talk
about
the
goldberg
and
kelly
type
of
cases
where
the
state
does
grant
a
right,
even
if
it's
not
granted
constitutionally.
i
think
there's
a
clear
line
of
cases
with
the
griffin/douglas
line
of
cases
that
would
provide
support
for
that.
and
evitts
v.
lucey
is
very
close
to
this
case,
and
rests
on
due
process
grounds.
although
of
course
i'm
also
arguing
equal
protection,
because
i
have
an
indigent
who
is,
with
a
court
appointed
attorney,
forced
to
take
whatever
the
state
gives
her.
pennsylvania
law
gives
no
right
to
the
indigent
to
complain
about
which
attorney
she
gets.
and
the
indigent
has
to
take
whichever
attorney
it
is
and
can't
request
them.
i
think
for
equal
protection
reasons,
it
would
probably
be
reasonable
for
the
court
to
more
closely
scrutinize
court
appointed
counsel's
conduct
in
this
regard,
and
to
make
sure
that
the
poor
defendant,
petitioner,
gets
the
same
justice
that
the
wealthier
one
can
afford
to
get.
so
my
argument
rests
both
on
due
process
and
on
equal
protection.
the
no
merit
letter,
by
contrast,
does
violence
to
both
due
process
and
equal
protection.
the
district
attorney
has
suggested
that
there
may
be
other
ways
to
deal
with
this
problem.
i
can
conceive
that
there
may
be
other
ways.
i
don't
think
the
district
attorney
has
suggested
anyway
that
we
can
deal
with
it,
but
there
may
be
other
ways.
the
no
merit
letter
is
not
the
way
to
deal
with
it.
this
court
specifically
disapproved
of
the
no
merit
letter
in
the
anders
case.
i
see
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
direct
appeal
and
collateral
review
when
talking
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
no
merit
letter.
it
has
the
terrible
handicap
that
it
forces
the
court
appointed
counsel
to
argue
against
his
own
client,
and
it
puts
the
petitioner
in
the
position
of
having
the
state
give
her
a
lawyer
who
thereafter
briefs
the
case
for
the
prosecution.
i
think
the
no
merit
letter
is
affirmatively
bad
in
that
respect,
and
is
not
a
substitute
for
anders.
it
may
be
that
there's
another
state
in
the
union
that
has
come
up
with
a
better
way
to
deal
with
this
problem,
but
the
district
attorney
hasn't
suggested
one,
and
the
no
merit
letter
is
not
that
case.
as
i
also
stated--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--in
this
case?
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
i
think
what
should
have
been
done
is
apply
anders,
so
that--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--so
that
the
court
could
get
to
the
merits
of
the
case
with
the
benefit
of
an
advocate's
marshalling
of
the
facts
and
evidence.
and
the
court
would
not
be
compelled
to
do
it
on
its
own.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
so
i
think
anders
would
be
the
proper
solution
here,
and
that's
what
the
pennsylvania
courts
decided
was
the
proper
solution.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
yes,
i
think
anders
requires
a
brief.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
he
has
to
say
not
only
more
than
he
said
in
that
letter,
but
he
has
to
avoid
making
an
argument
against
it.
i
think
anders
calls
for
citations
to
the
record
and
to
legal
authority.
it
doesn't...
and
i
think
that
it
affirmatively
disapproves
of
the
idea
that
you
can
write
out
what
the
petitioner
wants
raised,
and
then
say,
but
it's
a
terrible
argument,
or
it
won't
fly,
or
don't
pay
any
attention
to
this,
court.
because
that
places
in
the
lawyer
the
job
that
belongs
to
the
court.
in
the
adversary
system
it's
a
spirit
of
give
and
take--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--pardon?
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
and
counsel
had
conducted
a
careful
review?
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
i
can
conceive
of
that
case.
i
guess
what--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--i
guess
what
counsel
should
do
in
that
event
is
simply
set
out
that
she
was
sentenced
on
count
two
before
count
one;
point
the
court
to
the
appropriate
sentencing
rules
and
whatever
cases
construe
them
in
their
fairness;
and
point
to
whatever
position
there
is
in
the
record
that
might
support
the
argument
on
behalf
of
the
advocate;
and
let
the
court
decide.
and
if
it
gets
thrown
out,
then
that's
the
way
the
adversary
system
works.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
well,
that's
a
big
difference,
because...
there's
a
couple
of
differences.
first
of
all--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--i
was
able
to
find
arguable
issues
that
don't
appear
in
that
letter.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
it
is
true
that
her
defense
was
an
alibi.
but--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--it
is
true...
no,
it
is
true
that
her
defense
was
an
alibi.
but
you
have
to
remember
that
the
most
important
witness
at
her
trial
was
a
prosecution
witness
who
received
two
years'
probation
for
his
part
in
this.
and
after
the
trial,
dorothy
finley
asked
to
speak
to
the
court.
after
she
was
convicted...
it
was
a
bench
trial...
she
asked
to
speak
to
the
court,
and
the
court
permits
her,
and
she
begins
to
tell
why
the
prosecution
witness
would
have
other
reasons
to
be
biased
against
her,
and
would
be
unfairly
disposed,
for
his
own
reasons,
to
give
testimony
that
would
benefit
the
prosecution.
none
of
that's
in
this
case,
because
that
wasn't
raised
by
the
pcha
counsel.
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
that
is
correct.
that
is
a
portion--
ms.
catherine
m.
harper
--that
is
the
course
chosen.
i
wouldn't
take
footnote
7
to
be
a
statement
of
all
the
reasons
that
could
be
raised
in
this
case.
you
have
to
remember,
first
of
all,
that
when
i
got
this
case,
i
was
in
the
superior
court.
i
had
no
right
to
raise
evidentiary
issues.
i
merely
raised
them
for
illustrative
purposes,
and
the
court
let
me
do
that.
you
also
have
to
remember
that
i
only
had
the
record
that
was
available
in
the
court...
which
by
the
way
didn't
include
the
suppression
motions
and
other
pieces
of
paper
that
i
think
counsel
should
look
at
before
they
make
a
determination
on
collateral
review.
so
i
would
not...
i
would
ask
this
court
not
to
take
footnote
7
as
anything
other
than
illustrative
of
the
issues
that
could
have
been
raised
and
should
have
been
raised
by
counsel.
i'd
like
to
state
in
summary,
then,
that
where
the
state
grants
a
valuable
right
to
its
citizens,
in
this
case,
the
right
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
collateral
review,
that
right
cannot
be
taken
away
without
giving
the
affected
citizens
due
process.
the
anders
procedure
is
the
due
process
that
is
required
in
this
case.
because
this
is
a
case
involving
a
court
appointment,
i
would
also
ask
your
honors
to
consider
that
there
are
equal
protection
considerations
as
well;
and
that
is
because
she
cannot
choose
her
own
attorney,
she
has
to
take
what
the
state
gives
her.
and
also,
because
the
court
wants
to
ensure
that
the
indigent
prisoners
get
the
same
equal
protection
and
due
process
as
wealthier
individuals.
i'd
also
ask
the
court
to
consider
that
the
alternative
in
this
case...
and
what
we
are
really
talking
about
here
is
a
procedure,
the
no
merit
letter...
is
not
sufficient
under
due
process
or
equal
protection
guidelines
for
the
reasons
ably
stated
in
anders.
and
in
the
alternative,
i'd
argue
that
this
decision
of
the
superior
court
rests
on
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds,
and
that
this
court
can
decline
to
accept
jurisdiction
and
let
the
pennsylvania's
court
choice
to
deal
with
this
difficult
problem
stand.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
