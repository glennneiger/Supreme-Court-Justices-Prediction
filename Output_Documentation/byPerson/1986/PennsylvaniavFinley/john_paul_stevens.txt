justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
for
a
second?
is
it
correct
in
your
view
that
if
pennsylvania...
the
pennsylvania
courts
decided
they
would
like
to
apply
anders
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
you
would
agree
they
would
have
the
power
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
view
is
that
when
they
refer
to
the
pennsylvania
law
in
this
area,
it
is
derived
from
anders,
that
they
thought
they
were
compelled
by
anders
to
apply
the
anders
rule
in
collateral
proceedings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
any
other
state
so
read
anders,
as
far
as
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
iowa,
arkansas,
and
texas,
do
you
understand
they
did
it
because
they
thought
anders
compelled
them
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that
question,
a
matter
that
was
not
raised
on
direct
appeal
of
course
wouldn't
have
gone
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
does
pennsylvania
have
a
rule
in
its
collateral
proceedings
that
issues
which
could
have
been
raised
on
direct
appeal
but
were
not
raised
are
barred
from
collateral
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
means
it
was
litigated
in
the
trial
court
and
no--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
on
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
appeal,
or
in
the
direct
proceeding?
i
mean,
say
it
was
raised
in
the
trial.
for
example,
there's
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence,
but
no
appeal
was
taken
from
the
adverse
ruling.
in
pennsylvania
practice,
could
that
be
raised
in
collateral
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
harper,
may
i
interrupt
again?
because
one
of
your
responses
to
justice
scalia
puzzled
me.
do
you
think
that
the
holding
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
this
case
is
based
on
its
view
that
this
procedure
in
pennsylvania
is
mandated
by
the
federal
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
point
is
that
they
said,
this
pennsylvania
rule
was
derived
from
marbury
v.
madison.
