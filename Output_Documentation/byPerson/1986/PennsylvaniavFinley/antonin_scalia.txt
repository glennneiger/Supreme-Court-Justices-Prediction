justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
it's
just
a
pennsylvania
right
we're
talking
about.
why
couldn't
pennsylvania...
suppose
the
pennsylvania
statute
had
been
very
clear
and
had
said,
the
only
right
we're
giving
here
is
the
right
to
have
a
member
of
the
bar,
in
good
standing,
look
over
this
case,
and
in
his
or
her
judgment,
decide
whether
there's
anything
worth
arguing.
suppose
that's
how
it
read.
would
there
be
anything
wrong
with
that?
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin

there.
i
mean,
so
long
as
you
give
it
to
a
lawyer
whose
in
good
standing,
you've
complied
with
the
pennsylvania
statute
and
treated
everyone
alike.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
this
pennsylvania
statute
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
although
pennsylvania
need
not
provide
for
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
it
could
just
provide
to
have
some
lawyer
look
over
your
case,
if
it
does
provide
for
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
whether
the
assistance
is
in
fact
effective
is
a
federal
constitutional
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say,
modelled
after;
it
says
derived
from.
i
think
that
that's
normal
language
to
indicate
that
you
feel
that
one
case
requires
a
legal
rule
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
say
it's
at
least
ambiguous?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
if
i
said
this
rule
is
derived
from
marbury
v.
madison,
that
it
couldn't
be
read
to
mean
that
i
think
marbury
v.
madison
requires
this
rule
in
the
present
case?
maybe
not,
must,
but
could.
