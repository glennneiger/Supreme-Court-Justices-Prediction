ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
twenty
years
ago
this
court
imposed
strict
and
unique
briefing
requirements
on
appointed
attorneys
seeking
to
withdraw
because
they
concluded
that
a
client's
first
appeal
was
frivolous.
in
addition,
reviewing
courts,
charged
with
hearing
such
appeals,
were
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
conducting
an
independent
review
of
the
record
to
determine
whether
the
appeal
was
in
fact
frivolous.
this
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
those
procedures,
those
prophylactic
rules
as
articulated
by
this
court
in
anders
v.
california,
should
be
held
applicable
on
collateral
review.
it
is
our
position
that
they
should
not
be
held
applicable,
and
that
in
the
collateral
review
context,
a
no
merit
letter,
with
notice
to
the
client
and
an
opportunity
to
proceed
pro
se,
is
a
constitutionally
acceptable
alternative.
now
before
detailing
our
reasons
in
support
of
that
conclusion,
i
would
like
rather
briefly
to
address
the
respondent's
claim
that
this
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
issue
because
the
opinion
below
rests
on
an
adequate
and
independent
state
basis.
the
opinion
is,
of
course,
a
pennsylvania
superior
court
opinion;
although
that
is
an
intermediate
appellate
court,
it
is
the
highest
court
in
which
the
decision
could
be
had
in
this
case.
the
respondent
is
a
state
prisoner
having
been
convicted
in
1975
of
second
degree
felony
murder
and
related
offenses.
she
was
represented
by
appointed
counsel
during
his
trial,
and
during
her
unsuccessful
direct
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
she
next
sought
collateral
review
under
the
state
post
conviction
hearing
act
statute,
and
counsel
was
not
appointed
for
her
because
the
claims
that
she
raised
were
finally
litigated
under
pennsylvania
law.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
however,
held
that
under
its
supervisory
rules,
its
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
that
any
defendant
is
entitled
to
counsel
on
a
first
pcha
petition,
or
on
a
subsequent
petition
raising
new
issues.
when
counsel
was
appointed
for
mrs.
finley,
he
reviewed
the
record
and
concluded
that
he
had
no
arguable
issues
to
raise.
he,
as
a
result,
after
consulting
with
his
client,
filed
a
no
merit
letter
with
the
post
conviction
hearing
act
court,
and
detailed
in
that
letter
the
additional
claims
which
mrs.
finley
wanted
raised
on
her
behalf.
based
on
that
letter
and
his
own
independent
review
of
the
record,
the
post
conviction
hearing
act
judge
dismissed
the
petition
and
allowed
counsel
to
withdraw.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
we
know
from
his
letter
that
he
looked
at
the
notes
of
testimony.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
judge
blake
indicated
in
his
opinion
that
he
looked
at
the
entire
record.
we
also
know
that
he
consulted
with
his
client.
so
i
think
we
are
reasonably
certain
that
he
did
the
kind
of
conscientious
review
that
he
should
have
done,
and
which
this
court,
of
course,
in
strickland,
has
said
that
counsel
is
presumed
to
do
their
job
and
to
be
competent.
now
when
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
reversed
because
anders'
prophylactic
requirements
on
direct
appeal
had
not
been
complied
with,
they
said,
among
other
things,
since
anders
has
been
applied
in
similar
circumstances,
we
hold,
quote
unquote,
anders
is
applicable
here.
and
in
addition,
they
noted
that
the
pennsylvania
law
with
respect
to
the
withdrawal
of
counsel
is
derived
from...
and
those
were
their
exact
words...
anders
v.
california.
i
think
those
two
statements
by
the
superior
court
make
it
very
clear
that
there
is
not
an
independent
state
basis
for
this
opinion.
that
conclusion
is
underscored
by
the
fact
that
there
is
no
clear
statement
in
the
opinion
saying
we
used
the
federal
authority
only
for
purposes
of
guidance.
and
of
course
in
this
court's
opinion,
michigan
v.
long,
you
made
clear
to
state
courts
that
if
they
wanted
to
make
such
a
statement,
they
could.
so
i
think
there's
no
question
but
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
very
significant
issue
which
is
presented
here.
now,
i
think
the
starting
point
for
that
consideration
is
twofold.
first,
it
must
be
recalled
that
collateral
review
is
in
fact
a
procedure
which
is
three,
if
not
four,
steps
removed
from
the
trial
court
process.
by
that
point
in
the
proceedings,
a
defendant
has
had
the
opportunity
to
raise
matters
in
post
trial
motions.
a
defendant
has
had
a
direct
first
appeal.
a
defendant,
in
a
majority
of
jurisdictions,
has
had
the
opportunity
to
either
have
or
to
seek
discretionary
review.
collateral
review
is
three
or
four
steps
removed,
and
it's
a
procedure
which
is
intended
to
identify
those
rare
cases
in
which
there
is
error
that
has
not
been
previously
identified.
secondly,
it
is
of
course
very
important
that
there
is
no
general
constitutional
right
to
counsel
on
collateral
review.
nonetheless,
the
respondent
claims
that
since
counsel
was
given,
although
only
under
a
supervisory
rule,
not
under
a
constitutional
basis,
and
so
far
as
we
can
determine,
there
is
no
state
in
the
country
that
gives
counsel
on
collateral
review
based
on
a
state
constitutional
basis,
the
respondent
contends
that
since
the
right
to
counsel
is
there,
all
of
the
procedures
that
are
given
with
respect
to
the
right
to
counsel
on
a
first
appeal
should
be
given;
in
other
words,
that
anders
should
be
applied
even
though
we
are
only
talking
about
a
supervisory
right
to
counsel.
and
i
think
respondent
has
really
three
misconceptions.
first,
respondent
assumes
that
an
anders
brief
is
in
fact
an
advocate's
brief.
and
of
course,
an
anders
brief
is
not
that.
what
it
is
is
a
device
to
determine,
to
monitor,
whether
counsel
has
in
fact
conducted
the
sort
of
conscientious
and
thorough
review
of
the
case
to
be
certain
that
the
appeal
is
in
fact...
or
the
petition
is
in
fact...
frivolous.
i
think
counsel
does
not
take
account
of
the
fact
that
when
you
get
to
collateral
review,
you
are
getting
to
a
procedure
that
is
so
far
removed
that
there
simply
are
cases
without
arguable
issues
by
the
time
you
get
to
collateral
review.
and
i
think
finally
the
respondent
assumes
that
anders
is
the
only
way
of
being
sure
that
attorneys
do
their
job.
and
i
think
that
is
just
not
so.
attorneys
do
their
job.
attorneys
are
presumed
to
be
competent.
attorneys
have
an
obligation
not
to
clog
the
courts
with
frivolous
arguments.
and
i
think
that
you
need
not
apply
the
precise
procedures
of
anders
on
collateral
review
to
see
that
counsel
do
what
they're
charged
to
do,
which
is
to
do
their
job.
now,
the
important
considerations
are:
fundamental
fairness;
meaningful
access;
and
the
fact
that
there
are
not
the
invidious
discrimination,
the
fact
that
arbitrary
obstacles
not
be
put
in
a
defendant's
way
so
that--
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
--oh,
absolutely,
justice
stevens.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
that
is
our
position.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
yes,
the
district
of
columbia
has
so
read
anders;
has
applied
anders
on
collateral
review.
iowa
has.
i
believe
it's
arkansas
has,
and
texas
has.
illinois
has
not.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
yes,
i
believe
so.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
i
could
be
in
error,
but
i
believe
so.
and
we
have
about
three
other
states
that
have
found
anders
inapplicable
on
collateral
review:
illinois,
arizona,
and
i
believe
utah.
and
only
three
circuits
have
spoken
on
this
point.
the
second
and
fifth
circuits
have
found
anders
applicable,
and
i
believe
the
seventh
circuit
has
not.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
oh,
absolutely
not,
justice
marshall.
absolutely
not.
so
it's
our
point
that--
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
--the
no
merit
letter
indicates
a
carbon
copy
to
the
respondent.
there
has
been
no
evidence
to
rebut
the
fact
that
it
was
received.
the
respondent
speaks
in
terms
of,
quote
unquote,
apparent
lack
of
notice.
but
that
notice
has
not
been
rebutted,
and
there
are,
i
think,
a
number
of
arguments
to
be
made,
which
perhaps
i'll
reserve,
which
would
demonstrate
that
even
if
you
want
to
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
notice
was
not
received,
that
there
was
no
prejudice
to
this
particular
defendant
because
of
the
peculiarities
of
both
this
case
and
of
pennsylvania
practice.
so
if
you
take
the
fundamental
fairness,
the
meaningful
access,
and
the
no
invidious
discrimination
concepts,
and
i
think
apply
the
balancing
test
which
this
court
has
articulated
in
matthews
v.
eldridge,
and
then
applied
in
ake
v.
oklahoma,
what
we
should
look
at
is
the
individual
interest,
which
is,
here,
the
accuracy
of
the
criminal
proceeding
itself;
the
governmental
interest,
which
would
be
the
cost
to
the
criminal
justice
system
of
applying
anders;
and
finally,
what
value
is
to
be
derived
from
applying
the
procedure
here
sought,
anders,
whether
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
cases
would
be
identified
that
would
otherwise
be
lost
in
the
shuffle,
so
to
speak.
and
i
would
submit
that
when
you
apply
that
balancing
test,
the
line
should
be
drawn
to
say
that
anders
is
not
applicable
on
collateral
review.
the
chances
of
it
resulting
in
the
identification
of
cases
on
collateral
review
that
truly
have
even
arguable
issues,
i
think,
is
just
not
likely.
i
think
that
the
court
should
look
at
the
strains
on
the
criminal
justice
system,
if
you
conclude
that
anders
should
be
applied
on
collateral
review.
because
we
are
talking
about
post
conviction
hearing
remedies
and
petitions
which
are
burgeoning
out
of
all
proportions,
at
least
in
the
states,
and
i
would
assume
in
the
federal
system
too.
we
are
talking
about
a
complete
change
in
the
role
of
the
courts,
who
are
not
sitting
as
courts,
but
are
required
to
conduct
this
independent
review
of
records,
which
puts
a
great
strain
on
one
of
our
scarcest
resources
at
this
time,
which
is
the
time
of
our
judges.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
i
think--
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
--i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
they
need
not
afford
counsel
except
in
those
rare
cases
where,
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
counsel
is
necessary,
which
is
a
statistically
insignificant
number
of
cases,
i
believe,
even
in
the
federal
system.
i
think
a
no
merit
letter
with...
which
states
that
counsel
has
conducted
a
meaningful
and
thorough
review,
with
notice
to
the
client
and
an
opportunity
for
the
client
to
proceed
pro
se,
so
that
the
client
is
in
substantially
the
same
position
as
they
would
have
been
had
counsel
not
been
appointed.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
the
state
must
provide
access
to
the
courts.
the...
if
they
have
collateral
review,
as
do
all
states,
they
must
allow
counsel...
or
indigent
defendants
to
file
their
petitions;
to
not
have
fees
which
would
keep
them
out
of
court;
to
give
them,
if
they
are
incarcerated,
the
benefit
of
law
libraries,
under
bounds
v.
smith;
the
use
of
their
jailhouse
lawyers,
if
necessary,
under
johnson
v.
avery--
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
--i
think
that
would
be
a
very
rare
case
where
it
would
be
an
idiosyncratic
case
where
a
court
with
prescreening
would
discover
that
there
was
something
that
would
make
it
only
possible
for
counsel
to
handle
this
matter.
i
know
the
rule
in
the
federal
courts
usually
is
if
there
is
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
federal
habeas,
they
give
counsel.
we
have
at
least--
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
--on
any
first
petition.
any
first
post
conviction
hearing
at
petition,
or
any
subsequent
petition
that
raises
new
issues.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
i
think
due
process
requires
that
the
attorney
conduct
a
conscientious
and
meaningful
review
of
the
case
and
the
record.
so
that
having
given
that
indigent
an
attorney,
they
have
the
benefit
of
that
attorney's
best
review
of
the
record.
if
the
attorney
then
determines
that
there
is
nothing
even
arguable
to
raise,
i
submit
that
it
is
appropriate
for
him
to
be
allowed
to
withdraw
from
the
case.
i
mean,
we
are
talking
about
at
least
23
states,
as
nearly
as
we
can
determine,
that
have
very
liberal
policies
with
respect
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
far
more
liberal
than
the
federal
system.
and
the
strain
of
requiring
all
23
of
these
states
to
superimpose
anders
on
top
of
what
they're
giving,
above
and
beyond
what
they
must,
will,
i
submit,
put
a
very
great
strain
on
the
criminal
justice
system.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
yes,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
something
that
might
well
occur,
if
not
in
pennsylvania,
in
some
of
the
other
23
states,
if
it
is
held
by
this
court
that
anders
must
be
applied
on
collateral
review.
and
i
would
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
that
should
happen.
because
these
states
have
determined,
for
either...
for
one
reason
or
another
to
give
indigents
counsel
when
it's
not
necessary
for
them
to
do
so
constitutionally.
and
i
think
we
should
encourage
that,
but
not
superimpose
other
procedures
which
will
make
that
burdensome
on
the
states.
now
turning
to
this
defendant's,
this
respondent's
case,
she
undoubtedly
will
argue
to
you
that
there
was
no
notice,
therefore,
she
must
necessarily
win
the
case;
and
secondly,
that
her
appointed
pcha
attorney
was
ineffective
because
he
did
not
raise
certain
arguably
meritorious
issues.
we
have
addressed
both
of
those
in
our
reply
brief.
with
respect
to
the
so-called
issues,
i
have
dealt
with
them
in
a
footnote,
and
i
truly
believe
that
they
are
in
fact
frivolous
issues.
with
respect
to
the
notice
matter,
even
if
we
want
to
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
dorothy
finley
did
not
receive
the
no
merit
letter...
and
as
i
indicated,
it
shows
a
carbon
copy
to
her...
she
still
had
the
benefit,
in
this
particular
case,
of
having
the
time
consuming
independent
review
of
the
record,
which
was
conducted
by
the
post
conviction
hearing
act
judge.
and
he
concluded,
independently,
that
there
was
nothing
there.
and
finally,
under
the
peculiarities
of
pennsylvania
practice,
she
is
not
barred
from
filing
yet
another
post
conviction
hearing
act
petition,
and
raising
whatever
issues
she
would
want
to.
so
i
would
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
urge
you
to
hold
that
anders
does
not
apply
on
collateral
review.
and
i
would
urge
you
to
reverse
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
decision.
ms.
gaele
m.
barthold
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
see
no
reason
to
use
my
12
minutes.
