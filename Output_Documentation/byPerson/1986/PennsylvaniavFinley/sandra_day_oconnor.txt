justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mrs.
barthold,
while
you're
interrupted,
may
i
inquire
whether
the
record
reflects
whether
the
respondent
was
sent
a
copy
of
the
attorney's
no
merit
letter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mrs.
barthold,
what
do
you
think
the
federal
constitution
requires,
at
a
minimum,
through
its
due
process
clause,
when
the
state
has
granted
an
avenue
for
state
post
conviction
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
must
the
state
afford
counsel
at
all
to
indigent
defendants
in
that
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
say
the
facts
of
this
case
are
at
least
enough
to
meet
it.
but
at
bottom,
what
must
the
state
provide?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
some
cases,
it
must
provide
counsel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
pennsylvania,
it
is
the
practice
to
provide
counsel
uniformly
for
indigent
defendants,
i
take
it,
in
post...
state
post
conviction
review
proceedings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
given
that
as
a
factor,
then
what
do
you
think
due
process
requires,
above
and
beyond
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
counsel,
haven't
we
said,
in
michigan
v.
long,
that
when
the
court
doesn't
make
that
clear,
we're
going
to
assume
that
they
mean
it's
required
by
federal
law,
when
the
opinion
cites
federal
authority
and
doesn't
make
it
clear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
that
we
disagree
with
you.
and
we
have
to
face
up
to
what
we
do
here.
