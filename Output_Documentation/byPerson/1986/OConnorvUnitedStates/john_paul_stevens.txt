well,
but
mr.
phillips,
if
that's
the
interpretation,
then
panama
could
tax
one
of
these
employees'
income
from
dividends
bonds
in
the
united
states.
do
you
think
that's
right?
panama
could
do
that
if
you
read
that
sentence
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
imagine
it
would
be
a
concern
to
one
of
these
employees,
though.
mr.
phillips,
how
much
income
do
you
suppose
there
would
be
that
would
be
covered
by
your
interpretation
of
the
second
sentence
of
paragraph
2
of
article
15?
it's
income
derived
from
their
work
for
the
commission,
but
derived
outside
the
republic
of
panama.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
phillips,
before
you
leave
the
"similarly"
sentence,
refresh
my
recollection.
is
the
interpretation
of
that
sentence
which
you've
advanced
in
argument
today
found
anywhere
in
the
blue
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
blue
briefs,
the
appellee's
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
in
your
reply
brief?
