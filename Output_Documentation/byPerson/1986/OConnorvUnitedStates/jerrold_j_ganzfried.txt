mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
petitioners
have
to
pay
federal
income
taxes,
just
like
all
the
rest
of
us,
or
whether
they
alone
among
all
the
citizens
employed
by
the
united
states
government
and
its
agencies
at
home
and
abroad,
they
alone
are
exempt
from
united
states
taxation.
now,
when
we
clear
away
the
smoke
and
we
put
away
the
mirrors
of
petitioners'
argument,
several
simple
points
remain
and
they
are
dispositive
of
this
case.
the
first
is
that
when
the
language
of
the
agreement
is
read
in
context
petitioners'
construction
is
implausible.
second,
the
consistent
and
uniform
construction
of
the
executive
branch
is
that
there
is
no
exemption
from
united
states
taxes.
third,
the
executive
branch's
view
was
authoritatively
communicated
to
the
senate
at
the
time
of
ratification
on
behalf
of
the
offices
of
the
state
and
defense
departments
that
were
responsible
for
negotiating
and
drafting
the
treaty.
the
same
position
was
adopted
and
restated
in
the
senate
report,
and
the
consistent
administrative
practice
of
every
affected
executive
branch
department...
the
state
department,
the
department
of
treasury,
and
the
internal
revenue
service...
also
reflects
that
same
interpretation,
namely
no
exemption
from
u.s.
taxes.
in
addition
to
that,
both
governments
that
signed
the
treaty
and
its
implementing
agreements
concur
in
the
interpretation
that
we
present.
and
finally,
the
1976
tax
reform
bill
now
awaiting
the
president's
signature
restates
and
reconfirms
that
petitioners
are
not
exempt
from
united
states
taxes.
in
short,
the
correct
result
in
this
case
could
scarcely
be
clearer.
and
so,
in
discharging
its
sole
responsibility
in
this
area,
to
give
effect
to
the
intent
of
the
parties,
this
court
should
reject
petitioners'
efforts
to
create
for
themselves
a
private
tax
haven.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
first
sentence
says
"from
any
taxes".
i
point
out
it
doesn't
say
"from
united
states
taxes".
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
and
it
doesn't
say
"from
any
taxes
by
any
government.
"
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
says
"from
any
taxes",
language
which
was
derived...
well,
which
the
negotiating
history
makes
clear
the
only
taxes
that
were
discussed
were
panamanian
taxes.
but
that
language--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--oh,
absolutely
not.
this
discussion
about
a
compromise
where
neither
country
would
tax
is
pure
fiction.
it
has
no
support
in
the
negotiating
history.
incidentally,
the
first
sentence,
which
is
the
one
they're
relying
on
in
this
case,
is
in
its
operative
portion
identical
to
the
first
sentence
in
the
military
agreement,
article
16
of
the
agreement
in
implementation
of
article
4.
and
that
is
language
that
even
the
claims
court
recognized
at
pages
45a
and
46a
of
the
petition's
appendix,
acknowledged
did
not
create
an
exemption
from
united
states
taxes.
and
the
comments
by
the
panamanian
negotiators
during
the
negotiating
sessions
recognized
that,
as
far
as
the
military
was
concerned,
there
was
no
exemption
from
u.s.
taxes.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
my
first
answer
would
be
to
disagree
with
that
conclusion.
but
assuming
that
premise,
if
there
had
been
a
discussion
in
the
negotiating
history,
we
have
to
recognize
that
the
immediate,
quite
open
and
clear
position
of
the
united
states
was
that
there
was
no
exemption
from
united
states
taxes
created.
it
was
stated
openly
to
the
senate.
it
was--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--and
panama
has
never
disagreed
with
that.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i
would
still
insist
that
the
language
be
interpreted
that
way,
because
in
fact
even
if--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
i
wouldn't
say
put
it
aside,
but
we
would
then
have
an
additional
factor,
namely
the
consistent
position
of
the
united
states,
the
administrative
practice
in
the
years
since
the
treaty
was
ratified,
and
the
absence
of
any
objection
from
panama.
and
we're
withholding
taxes
on
u.s.
employees
who
are
residing
in
panama.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
would
be
the
interpretation.
in
fact,
there
is
an
example
of
that
in
the
ross
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--no
objection
from
panama
whatsoever.
in
fact,
the
only
indications
from
panama
relating
to
this
subject
indicate
that
panama
well
knew
that
the
united
states
was
withholding
and
collecting
taxes
from
its
citizens
employed
by
the
commission.
now,
our--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
the
position
in
the
claims
court,
which
was
prior
to
the
time
that
the
panamanian
government
had
expressed
its
views,
was
that
the
united
states
saw
no
need
to
go
to
panama.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
would
certainly
be
inappropriate
for
the
claims
court--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
claims
court
to
direct
the
government
to
go
there
or
to
rule
in
this
case
contrary
to
the
government's
position.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
basically--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--basically,
that
there
was
no
need
to
consider
the
panamanian
view.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
it
is
appropriate
that
you
consider
it
because
it
is
the
official
view
of
the
panamanian
government.
it
simply
didn't
exist
before
it
existed.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
excuse
me?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
state
department
has
advised
us
that
the
united
states
did
not
request
a
note
from
the
panamanian
government.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
opposition
is
suspicious.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
there
is
no
basis--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
that's
nonsense.
if
what
their
position
is
that
courts
of
the
united
states
should
be
suspicious
whenever
a
government
with
whom
we're
on
amiable
terms
states
a
position,
then
their
position
suggests
great
dangers
for
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
policy.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
note
had...
the
note
simply
didn't
exist
when?
the
case
was
before
judge
kozinski.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i
think
it
is.
in
fact,
what
were
we
to
do
when
the
note
arrived?
were
we
to
sit
back
and
say,
well,
it's
not
in
the
record
in
the
claims
court,
we
can't
present
it?
and
what
if...
and
i
will
assume
a
hypothetical
quite
contrary
to
fact...
what
if
the
panamanian
note
had
come
in
and
it
had
agreed
with
the
petitioners?
we
could
scarcely
have
sat
back
and
said,
well,
we
have
the
official
panamanian
view,
but
it's
not
part
of
the
record,
so
let's
disregard
it.
we
couldn't
have
done
that.
no
one
would
have
stood
for
that
for
a
minute.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
panamanian
government
has
never
said
anything
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
they
didn't
object
to
our
withholding
taxes.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
precisely.
the
panamanians...
this
case--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
we
didn't
have
an
official
statement
from
the
panamanian
government
to
that
effect.
we
simply
had
the
absence
of
any
objection
by
the
panamanian
government.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i
think
i
should
get
back
to
one
of
the
premises
here,
and
that
is
that
the
issue
of
united
states
taxation
or
exemption
from
united
states
taxation
was
never
a
part
of
the
discussions
leading
up
to
the
treaty
and
the
implementation
agreements.
as
a
result,
the
claims
court
essentially
required
the
government
to
prove
a
negative,
namely
to
point
to
a
place
in
the
negotiating
history
where
somebody
would
say,
we
are
not
discussing
the
following
subject.
that
was
an
impossible
situation.
inasmuch
as
the
question
of
an
exemption
from
united
states
taxation
was
not
a
part
of
the
discussion,
we
could
not
say
to
the
claims
court
that
it
was
a
subject
on
which
the
panamaian
government
had
ever
expressed
a
view
to
us
in
any
formal
sense.
but
what
we
did
know
was
that
the
agreement
had
never
incorporated
any
agreement
to
exempt
anyone
from
united
states
taxation,
certainly
not
u.s.
citizens
employed
by
the
commission.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
would
a
contrary
view?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
question
of
domestic
law,
and
if
panama
were
to
take
a
different
view
and
there
might
be
some
international
disagreement
as
between
the
united
states
and
panama,
that
would
be
a
different
matter
for
different
proceedings.
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it's
a
domestic
law
issue.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
note?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
this
case
the
answer
is
it
has
no...
the
view
of
the
panamanian
government
is
not
dispositive
of
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
don't
need
it
because
we
didn't
discuss
this
issue--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--we
didn't
go
get
it.
it
arrived.
the
context
of
this
was
that
when
this
case
was--
[laughter]
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
was
delivered
to
the
u.s.
ambassador
in
panama.
there
was
no
request
for
it.
the
situation
was,
when
the
case
was
pending
in
the
claims
court
that
panama
had...
that
this
issue
had
been
litigated
in
eleven
courts
previously.
all
of
those
courts
had
held
for
the
government.
the
government's
position,
the
united
states
government's
position,
was
stated
openly
in
the
ratification
hearings,
which
were
very
carefully
monitored
in
panama.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
don't
know
whether...
but
the
case
had
been...
the
issue
had
been
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government
in
eleven
courts.
and
then,
when
the
issue
was
resolved
in
another
way,
which
was
contrary
to
what
the
understanding
of
the
parties
to
the
agreement
were,
then
panama
saw
fit
to
express
its
views,
particularly
when
the
claims
court
had
relied
so
much
of
what
it
thought
was
panama's
position.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
am
advised
by
the
state
department
that
they
didn't
and,
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
department
would
be
the
appropriate
department
to
engage
in
negotiations
and
discussions
with
panama.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
someone
from
panama--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--someone
from
panama
might
have
called
and
said:
we
hear
about
this
case.
there
is
in
the
appendix,
the
court
of
appeals
appendix,
a
letter
from
the
general
counsel
of
the
panama
canal
commission
in
which
he
indicates
that
whenever
there
was
even
a
rumor
among
commission
employees
that
one
of
them
had
won
one
of
these
cases
there
was
a
flood
of
employees
changing
their
withholding
forms
to
claim
an
exemption,
and
then
they
had
a
lot
of
difficulty
when
they
discovered
that
the
rumors
were
untrue
and
people
had
to
go
back
and
make
changes.
so
it
was
clearly
activity
in
panama,
and
there
was
clearly
an
understanding
that
the
united
states
was
collecting
taxes.
despite
all
of
that,
panama
remained
silent.
all
of
the
affidavits
that
the
petitioners
have
submitted
at
various
stages,
attached
to
various
briefs
and
lodgings
in
the
courts
in
which
this
case
has
been
litigated,
are
statements
by
former
officials
of
been
panamanian
government,
who
incidentally
never
say
that
the
subject
of
an
exemption
from
u.s.
taxation
was
ever
discussed
during
the
negotiations.
and
they
then
state
their
own
personal
views
on
a
subject
on
which
none
of
them
ever
expressed
that
view
as
an
official
of
the
panamanian
government.
no
one
ever
came...
when
they
were
in
their
various
positions,
no
one
ever
came
to
the
united
states
government
and
said:
you're
taxing
your
people
and
we
have
a
treaty
that
says
you
can't.
and
in
fact,
quite
to
the
contrary.
when
the
most
recent
such
affidavit
arrived
from
mister...
submitted
by
mr.
royo
last
week
that
the
petitioners
have
filed,
it
seemed
so
curious
because
he
had
never
stated
that
position
that's
contained
in
that
affidavit
when
he
was
an
official
of
the
panamaian
government,
that
it
became
a
subject
of
considerable
curiosity.
and
consequently,
we
did
some
checking
on
those
views
and
we
found
that
when
he
was
the
president
of
panama
he
wrote
a
letter
to
president
carter
that's
contained
in
the...
that's
printed
in
the
congressional
record,
in
which
it's
quite
clear
that
mr.
royo
as
the
president
of
panama
understood
that
the
united
states
was
going
to--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it's
in
the
congressional
record.
it
has
not
been
presented
previously
in
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
okay,
i
understand.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
the
fact
is
that
this
court
and,
taking
lead
from
this
court,
other
courts
have
traditionally
considered
statements
from
foreign
governments,
even
if
they
have
come
in
during
the
course
of
litigation.
and
as
i
said
before,
when
it
arrived
it
was
scarcely
something
that
we
could
say,
sorry,
it's
too
late,
or
we're
not
going
to
pay
attention
to.
in
fact,
if
instead
of
putting
ribbons
on
that
note
and
delivering
it
to
the
u.s.
ambassador
in
panama,
the
panamanian
government
had
put
a
cover
on
it
and
filed
it
as
an
amicus
brief
in
the
federal
circuit
or
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
it
clearly
would
have
been
an
appropriate
submission,
even
if
they
had
taken
exactly
the
words
that
they
wrote
in
the
note
and
filed
it
as
an
amicus
brief.
and
surely
this
court
and
all
other
courts
in
the
country
will
accept
amicus
briefs.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
because
the
issue--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
issue
in
this
case
is
not...
we're
not
talking
about
the
adjudication
of
a
fact
on
which
you
would
make
your
presentation
and
you
then
are
left
with
the
record
that
you
presented
to
the
lower
court.
determining
the
meaning
of
a
treaty
or
the
implementing
agreement
in
this
case
is
similar,
in
terms
of
the
task
that's
called
upon
for
judges
to
perform,
as
reading
a
statute,
and
it's
simply
appropriate--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it's
a
guide
to
interpretation,
and
it's
certainly
an
appropriate
subject
of
judicial
notice.
in
fact,
though,
rather
than
spend
much
more
time
on
the
panamanian
note,
our
position
doesn't
depend
on
the
panamanian
note,
because
our
position
is
even
if
you
look
simply
at
the
language
of
the
implementing
agreement
in
context,
the
petitioner's
position
is
implausible,
particularly
when
you
realize
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
tax
exemption
and
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
provisions
granting
special
tax
exemptions
are
to
be
strictly
construed.
now,
their
argument
flows
from
the
notion
that
fragments
of
the
agreement
can
be
isolated
and
interpreted
without
regard
to
their
surroundings.
now,
let's
recognize
that
this
was
not
first
and
foremost
a
tax
treaty.
the
overall
effect
and
the
principal
purpose
of
the
package
of
treaties
and
agreements
signed
on
september
7th,
1977,
was
to
reduce
the
united
states'
presence
in
the
area
of
panama
known
as
the
canal
zone.
to
that
effect,
the
treaty
restored
to
panama
territorial
sovereignty
over
the
canal
zone,
ending
the
period
when
the
united
states
had
exercised
the
rights,
power,
and
authority
it
would
have
if
it
were
the
sovereign.
the
treaty
gave
to
the
united
states
the
rights
to
manage,
operate,
and
maintain
the
canal.
but
it
recognized
in
article
1,
paragraph
3,
that
the
republic
of
panama
shall
participate
increasingly
in
the
management
and
protection
and
the
defense
of
the
canal.
to
carry
out
that
goal,
the
goal
of
increased
panamanian
participation,
article
10
of
the
treaty
requires
that
a
preference
be
given
to
panamanian
applicants
for
employment,
that
within
five
years
from
the
effective
date
the
number
of
carry-over
u.s.
citizens
employed
by
the
commission
be
reduced
by
20
percent,
that
subsequently
hired
united
states
citizen
employees
be
rotated
out
of
panama
at
least
every
five
years,
and
that
an
early
retirement
program
be
set
up
for
u.s.
citizen
employees
to
encourage
early
retirement
by
making
liberal
annuities
available
to
them.
now,
with
the
restoration
of
sovereignty
to
panama,
one
of
the
issues
that
had
to
be
resolved
was
how
the
new
sovereign
would
treat
our
employees,
that
is
u.s.
government
employees,
keeping
in
mind
that
the
treaty
itself
recognizes
that
the
panama
canal
commission
is
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
so
all
of
the
suggestions
by
petitioner
and
in
the
claims
court
opinion
that
somehow
this
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
organization--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it's
definer
as
a
u.s.
government
agency.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
commission,
its
practical
position
on
this
issue
is
that
it
has
been
withholding
taxes
from
employees.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it's
never
taken
that
position.
the
letter
from
the
general
counsel
of
the
commission
that's
contained
in
the
record
indicates
that
treaty
interpretation
is
a
subject
on
which
the
commission
felt
that
it
did
not
have
the
expertise
to
opine
and
left
that
to
the
state
department
and
the
executive
branch;
and
on
the
consequences
for
u.s.
tax
law,
that
that
was
a
subject
on
which
it
would
defer
to
other
agencies,
and
specifically
refer
to
the
opinion
of
the
office
of
legal
counsel
of
the
department
of
justice,
that
is
consistent
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
exemption
from
u.s.
taxation.
in
agreeing
to
shift
the
u.s.
government's
exercise
of
powers
from
a
territorial-based
position
to
one
that
was
functionally
related
to
the
particular
functions
that
the
united
states
was
permitted
under
the
treaty,
one
of
the
issues
was
how
u.s.
citizens
were
going
to
be
treated
insofar
as
taxes.
and
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
the
implementation
agreement
in
which
the
tax
provision
is
contained
was
intended
to
define
the
rights
of
united
states
citizens
with
respect
to
panama.
relations
between
the
united
states
government
and
its
own
citizens
and
employees
underwent
no
change.
that
is,
before
the
treaty
these
were
u.s.
citizens
employed
by
the
u.s.
government
agency.
after
the
treaty
they
continued
to
be
u.s.
citizens
employed
by
a
u.s.
government
agency.
now,
if
we
turn
to
the
treaty
in
implementation
of
article
3,
the
basic
themes
of
the
underlying
treaty
itself
are
restated.
so
articles
9
and
11
establish
a
preference
for
panamanian
sources
to
furnish
supplies
and
services
for
the
commission.
and
in
article
15
we
have
the
question
of
taxation.
at
the
time...
up
to
the
time
that
the
treaty
was
in
effect,
the
income
tax
situation
was
this:
united
states
citizen
employed
by
the
then.
panama
canal
company,
like
all
other
u.s.
citizens
employed
by
a
u.s.
government
agency,
paid
u.s.
income
taxes.
but
because
they
lived
and
worked
in
an
area
over
which
the
united
states
exercised
rights
it
would
have
as
sovereignty,
they
paid
no
income
taxes
to
panama.
the
treaty,
as
we've
indicated,
affected
only
the
relationship
between
the
employees
and
panama.
so
article
15
makes
no
reference
to
united
states
taxation.
it
creates
no
express
or
implied
exemption
from
u.s.
taxation.
rather,
that
article
preserves
the
status
quo
of
no
income
tax
by
panama
in
a
way
that's
consistent
with
the
position
the
united
states
maintains
for
its
citizen
employees
in
all
foreign
nations
around
the
world.
now,
while
there
was,
as
the
contemporaneous
negotiating
history
shows,
considerable
debate
on
panama's
expressed
desire
to
tax
those
u.s.
citizens,
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
issue
was
resolved
by
panama's
agreement
that
there
would
be
an
exemption
from
panamanian
taxation.
but
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
negotiating
history
that
the
subject
of
a
total
exemption
from
united
states
taxes
was
ever
considered
or
discussed.
we
needn't
go
very
far
from
the
words
of
the
first
sentence
of
article
15,
paragraph
2,
to
see
that
the
context
supports
the
government's
position.
in
fact,
as
mentioned
earlier,
we
don't
need
to
leave
those
words
at
all
because
the
words
in
the
first
sentence
are
identical
to
the
words
in
article
16
of
the
military
agreement,
and
the
claims
court
and
the
panamanian
minister
at
page
141
of
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
recognized
that
military
people
would
pay
taxes
to
the
united
states,
u.s.
citizen
military
people.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i've
been
advised
by
the
panama
canal
commission
that
from
october
1,
1979,
the
date
that
the
treaty
went
into
effect,
until
september
22nd,
1986,
the
amount
of
taxes
withheld
from
salaries
of
commission
employees
was
slightly
in
excess
of
$100
million.
our
point
on
the
meaning
of
the
first
sentence
of
paragraph
2
is
that...
is
made
even
clearer
if
you
just
go
to
the
next
sentence
in
paragraph
2.
if
the
petitioners
are
correct
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
first
sentence,
then
presumably
the
second
sentence
would
mean
that
u.s.
citizens
employed
by
the
commission
are
exempt
from
u.s.
taxes
on
everything
that
they
might
earn
in
the
united
states,
whether
it
be
interest
on
bank
accounts,
dividends
on
stocks,
or
income
from
rental
property.
now,
in
their
reply
brief
they've
proposed
a
new
interpretation
of
this
second
sentence.
it's
basically
nonsense,
because
on
the
face
of
it
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
what
they
have
done
is
suggested
that
the
first
sentence
is
subject
to
no
limitations,
it
means
any
taxes.
but
when
they
get
to
the
second
sentence
they
say,
well,
the
second
sentence
must
mean
only
taxes,
only
on
income
from
the
commission
outside
of
panama.
never
mind
that
the
agreement
itself
defines
a
u.s.
citizen
employee
as
someone
working
for
the
commission
in
panama.
but
since
the
second
sentence
refers
only
to
commission
income
outside
of
panama,
therefore
the
first
sentence
must
refer
to
commission
income
inside
of
panama.
well,
they've
now
put
back
into
the
first
sentence
the
very
qualifier
which
in
paragraphs
1
and
3
they
recognize
means
that
only
panamanian
taxes
are
affected.
and
you
also
end
up
with
the
silly
result
that
any
other
income
they
have
in
the
united
states
can
be
taxed
by
panama,
any
other
income
they
have
in
panama
could
be
taxed
by
the
united
states.
it
just
doesn't
work.
and
to
suggest
that
the
second
sentence
would
mean
that
there
would
be
an
exemption
for
anything
else
they
earned
in
the
united
states
would
create
the
kind
of
incentive
for
them
to
remain
on
the
job
indefinitely
that
is
contrary
to
the
position
that
panama
took
in
the
negotiations
and
all
the
provisions
designed
to
reduce
the
u.s.
role
in
the
operations
of
the
canal.
so
if
we
had
only
the
language
of
the
treaty,
it's
our
position
that
the
government
should
prevail.
and
of
course
we
have
more
than
that.
we
have
the
position
the
united
states
consistently
took
in
the
negotiating
history,
namely
that
we
were
discussing
only
an
exemption
from
panamanian
taxation.
in
fact,
the
backup
position
that
the
panamanians
proposed,
namely,
well,
let
us
tax
but
you
give
them
a
credit,
that
presupposes
that
the
united
states
is
going
to
be
taxing
its
citizens
employed
by
the
commission.
there's
no
need
for
a
credit
if
there's
an
exemption
from
united
states
taxation.
and
i
think
that
maybe
nothing
makes
the
point
more
clearly
that
only
the
subject
of
panamanian
taxation
was
under
discussion
than
the
statement
made
by
ambassador
bunker
at
page
146
of
the
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals,
at
which
he
said
that:
"u.s.
government
employees
do
not
pay
income
tax
anywhere
in
the
world.
"
now,
what
could
more
clearly
show
that
they
were
talking
about
countries
other
than
the
united
states?
the
consistency
of
the
government's
position
is
maintained
following
the
signing
of
the
treaty
and
its
implementing
agreements,
and
we've
adhered
vigorously
to
that
interpretation
without
wavering.
that
is,
that
article
15
creates
no
exemption.
the
section
by
section
analysis,
which
is
an
authoritative
statement
by
the
state
and
defense
departments,
takes
that
position.
the
legal
advisor
to
the
state
department
in
questions
before
the
senate
took
that
position.
and
much
has
been
made
of
senator
stone's...
in
the
briefs,
of
senator
stone's
comments.
but
if
we
read
everything
that
senator
stone
had
to
say,
he
simply...
he
never
expressed
any
disagreement
with
the
state
department's
position.
he
simply
inquired
whether...
he
just
said
he
was
trying,
he
was
only
trying
to
avoid
lawsuits
such
as
this
one,
which
he
agreed
"would
not
really
be
much
of
a
lawsuit.
"
now,
the
senate
report
adopted
that
interpretation,
and
the
consistent
administrative
practice,
as
i've
indicated,
has
been
taxes
are
withheld
and
any
claims
for
exemption
based
on
this
treaty
are
denied
by
the
irs.
that's
been
the
consistent
position
of
the
department
of
justice,
the
department
of
state,
department
of
defense,
department
of
the
treasury.
and
of
course,
the
latest
legislative
action
on
the
subject
is
the
tax
reform
act
of
1986,
which
reconfirms
and
restates
with
all
the
precision
and
clarity
that
anyone
could
ask
for
that
the
treaty
has
never
made
petitioners
exempt
from
u.s.
taxes.
so
on
the
basis
of
all
this
clear
history,
there
really
isn't
any
serious
doubt
that
as
a
matter
of
domestic
law
there
is
no
exemption
from
u.s.
taxation,
none
was
intended,
and
none
was
created.
so
our
position
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
federal
circuit
should
be
affirmed,
even
if
the
panamanian
government
had
remained
silent,
as
we
know
it
didn't.
as
of
this
date,
both
governments
are
in
concurrence
as
to
what
the
treaty
means,
and
in
those
circumstances
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
and
petitioners
should
have
to
pay
u.s.
income
taxes
just
like
the
rest
of
us
do.
thank
you.
