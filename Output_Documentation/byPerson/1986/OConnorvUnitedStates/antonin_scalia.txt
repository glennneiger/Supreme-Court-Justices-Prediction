but
it
isn't
just
that
income
that
your
position
addresses.
you've
said
that
you
go
all
the
way
with
the
logic
of
your
position
and
say
that
the
second
sentence
means
that
the
united
states
cannot
tax
these
corrects
on
any
income.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
just
did
in
your
response
to
justice
o'connor.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
weight
you're
putting
on
the
word
"similarly"?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
the
united
states,
under
your
preferred
theory,
the
united
states
could
tax
and
panama
could
tax
income
outside,
from
outside
panama?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
serious
concern
to
the
government?
here
you
have
the
united
states,
that
had
zonians
who
previously
had
been
entirely
exempt
from
panama
taxes,
and
you're
saying
that
what
we
negotiated
for
was
above
all
things
to
make
sure
that
they
couldn't
be
taxed
on
their
income
from
the
canal,
but
we
didn't
care
whether
they
could
thereafter
be
taxed
by
panama
on
income
from
elsewhere.
it
seems
to
me
that
would
have
it
absolutely
upside-down.
it's
much
more
natural
to
allow
them
to
be
taxed
for
their
income
from
the
canal
than
to
allow
panama
to
tax
them
on
income
from
elsewhere.
that
seems
to
me
much
more
an
assertion
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
"if
you
take
the
note
at
face
value.
"
is
there
any
reason
not
to
take
the
note
at
face
value?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean.
do
they
indicate
that
the
note
is
a
forgery?
justice
antonin
scalia
suspicious--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
sets
forth
the
panamanian
position.
what
you
think
is
suspicious
is
that
maybe
that
was
not
originally
the
panamanian
position,
is
that
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
have
no
doubt
that
that's
the
current
panamanian
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
don't
need
a
note.
i
don't
understand
that.
what
use
is
a
note
if
you
have
the
plain
meaning
of
the
agreement?
we
resort
to
a
note
to
clarify.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you...
well,
what
is
your
position
as
to
whether
panama
could
have
had
one
interpretation
originally
and
then
changed
its
mind
about
what
the
agreement
meant?
can
panama
do
that?
suppose
initially
panama
looked
at
that
language
and
said,
it
means
x,
but
later
on
its
foreign
ministry
had
second
thoughts
and
said
it
means
y.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
second
position
have
any
force
as
far
as
the
deliberations
of
this
court
are
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
it's
ambiguous.
