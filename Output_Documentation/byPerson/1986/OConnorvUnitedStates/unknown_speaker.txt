unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this.
would
a
contrary
view
of
the
panamanian
government
affect
the
government's,
affect
the
united
states'
position?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
what
use
is
the
note?
unknown
speaker
if
it
went
the
wrong
way,
it
would
have
been
no
good
at
all.
what
interest
does
panama
have
in
the
united
states'
relationship
with
its
citizens?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
you
go
get
it?
unknown
speaker
i
really
wish
the
state
department
has
asked
for
it,
mr.
ganzfried.
i
find
that
impossible
to
believe.
this
things
just...
somebody
found
it
under
the
door?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
somebody
in
panama
was
following
this
litigation
and
just
thought
they
should
come
to
the
aid
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
the
state
department
didn't
ask
for
it.
you
don't
know
for
sure
that
no
other
agency
of
the
government
asked
for
it?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
requests
come
in
many
forms.
you
may
not
have
asked
for
it,
but
somebody
could
have
said:
gee,
it
might
help
your
position
in
other
positions
if
you
wrote
this
letter.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
asking
you
to
do
it,
but--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
could
we
try
to
stay
in
the
record
in
this
case?
we're
far
enough
outside
of
it.
let's
not
go
any
further
outside
the
record.
i'm
only
speaking
for
myself.
unknown
speaker
but
i
think
the
government
went
outside
the
record
and
negotiated
it
while
the
case
was
pending.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
sense
of
having
a
record
if
anybody
can
go
outside
of
it?
unknown
speaker
or
to
put
it
as
this
case,
the
government
can
go
outside
of
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
like
taking
judicial
notice?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
agency
is--
unknown
speaker
--the
commission
is
a
u.s.
government
agency.
what
has
been
the
ccmmission's
position
on
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
has
it
ever
expressed
a
position
contrary
to
this,
that
really
the
treaty
exempts
its
employees
from
u.s.
taxes?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ganzfried,
how
much
by
way
of
dollars
are
we
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
they
have
been
withholding
u.s.
taxes,
though,
haven't
they?
unknown
speaker
but
the
general
counsel
has
never
issued
any...
has
never
taken
the
position
that
the
treaty
means
what
you
say
it
does?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
supervisory
board?
unknown
speaker
but
there
would
be
another
forum
if
the
treaty
means
what
you
say
it
means.
that
is,
the
other
forum
would
be
to
protest,
a
protest
by
the
government
of
panama.
unknown
speaker
do
you
in
your
brief
identify
specifically
the
material
in
the
negotiating
history,
page
by
page,
in
the
record
that
you
think
best
supports
your
position?
unknown
speaker
in
the
what?
unknown
speaker
does
it
specifically
mention
united
states
taxes?
no.
