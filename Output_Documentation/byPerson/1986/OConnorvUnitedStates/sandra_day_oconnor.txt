mr.
phillips,
could
i
ask
you
about
the
language
of
the
implementation
agreement
itself,
which
i
suppose
is
where
we
need
to
start.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
your
view
of
it,
u.s.
employees
are
exempt
from
taxes
by
any
government
on
income
received
from
their
work
for
the
commission.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
likewise
from
payment
of
taxes
on
income
derived
from
sources
outside
panama.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
gather
under
your
view,
if
there
were
outside
income
from
sources
within
panama
there
is
no
exemption
and
both
governments
can
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
gather
if
there
were
income
earned
within
panama
that
wasn't
earned
from
the
commission
work--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--both
governments
could
tax
that,
i
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
a
little
bizarre,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
perhaps.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
is
an
odd
result.
may
i
also
inquire,
now,
there
is
similar
language
in
a
treaty
pertaining
to
taxation
of
military
personnel
of
the
united
states
stationed
in
panama?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
remarkably
similar,
wouldn't
you
say?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
position
there?
is
the
income
of
military
personnel
stationed
in
panama
subject
to
u.s.
taxation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
first
sentence
says:
"members
of
the
forces
and
dependents.
"
and
so
forth,
"shall
be
exempt
from
any
taxes,
fees,
or
other
charges
on
income
received
as
a
result
of
their
work
for
the
united
states
forces.
"
now,
that's
very
similar
to
the
language
you're
relying
on
in
your
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
take
the
position,
if
pressed,
that
military
personnel
income
is
taxable
by
the
united
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
other
place
in
the
world
to
your
knowledge
where
the
united
states
has
agreed
to
make
income
received
by
united
states
citizen
or
military
personnel
not
taxable
by
the
united
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
may
i
ask
also
whether
you
concede
that
the
most
recently
filed
document
from
panama's
minister
of
foreign
relations
is
authentic?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
some
reason
to
question
its
authenticity,
do
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
grant
you
that
that's
frustrating,
but
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
whether
we
have
to
be
concerned
with
its
authenticity
in
your
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
can
we
safely
assume
that
right
now
both
parties
to
the
treaty,
the
united
states
and
panama,
agree
that
article
15
does
not
exempt
this
income
from
u.s.
taxation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ganzfried,
as
long
as
you're
interrupted,
as
i
understand
it
the
united
states
government
in
the
proceedings
below
took
the
position
that
the
court
need
not
consider
the
official
view
of
panama
on
the
question,
and
indeed
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
do
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
do
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
the
position
the
government
took?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
i
understood
the
argument,
also
inappropriate
to
even
consider
the
panamanian
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
now
all
of
a
sudden--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
government
presents
this
last
minute
panamanian
view.
is
it
now
appropriate
that
we
consider
it?
