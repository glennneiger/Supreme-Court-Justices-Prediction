mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
article
15
of
the
agreement
in
implementation
of
article
3
of
the
panama
canal
treaty
exempts
from
united
states
taxation
income
received
by
u.s.
citizens
for
work
performed
for
the
panama
canal
commission.
petitioners
are
united
states
employees
of
the
commission
who
seek
refunds
of
income
taxes
paid
for
various
years
since
1979.
the
claims
court,
in
a
thorough
and
thoughtful
opinion
by
chief
judge
koninski,
held
the
petitioners
are
entitled
to
a
tax
exemption.
the
federal
circuit,
relying
in
some
measure
upon
a
diplomatic
note
from
panama,
then
recently
supplied
by
the
government
at
the
circuit
court
level,
reversed.
petitioners
submit
that
the
claims
court
correctly
interpreted
the
implementing
agreement
on
the
basis
of
its
plain
language,
its
structure,
and
the
negotiating
history,
and
therefore
we
seek
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
analysis
of
the
implementing
agreement
obviously
must
begin
with
the
plain
language
used
by
the
signatories,
as
that
language
is
understood
in
context.
the
language,
we
submit,
is
strikingly
favorable
to
petitioners,
and
provides
in
relevant
part:
"united
states
employees
shall
be
exempt
from
any
taxes,
fees,
or
other
charges
on
income
received
as
a
result
of
their
work
for
the
commission.
"
no
reference
appears
in
that
language
to
panamanian
taxes,
and
it
stands
is
stark
contrast
to
the
other
two
paragraphs
of
article
15.
this
language
also
differs
significantly
from
parallel
language
in
article
16
of
the
agreement
in
implementation
of
article
4
of
the
panama
canal
treaty,
which
concerns
members
of
the
military.
that
provision,
which
the
government
has
acknowledged
was
the
model
for
this
one,
contains
a
specific
reference
to
panamanian
law.
that
reference
was
deleted,
for
reasons
that
are
not
altogether
clear.
but
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
has
been
made
clear
by
this
court's
decisions
both
in
air
france
and
in
santo
vicenzo
that
the
deletion
of
language,
of
parallel
language,
has
meaning.
and
the
meaning
in
this
instance
we
submit
was
to
exempt
united
states
citizens
from
taxation.
based
on
that
plain
meaning
argument,
the
natural
question
that
will
necessarily
arise
is,
why
would
united
states
negotiators
agree
to
exempt
united
states
employees
from
the
taxes.
i
think
in
order
to
understand
that
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
political
climate
in
1977
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
these
negotiations.
the
carter
administration
was
deeply
committed
to
an
agreement.
the
question
of
giving
up
the
canal
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
internal
debate.
the
only
thing
left
were
the
circumstances
under
which
that
canal
would
be
transferred
back
to
panama.
the
basic
question
was
under
what
circumstances
panama
would
receive
back
the
panama,
and
panama
would
not
receive
back
that
canal,
which
is
made
clear
through
the
negotiating
history,
except
on
terms
that
demonstrated
clearly
panamanian
sovereignty
over
the
canal
zone.
unfortunately,
we
do
not
have
the
exact
exchanges
that
led
up
to
the
final
agreement
of
article
15,
paragraph
2.
nevertheless,
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
exchanges
among
the
various
ministers
with
the
united
states
negotiators
that
panama
would
not
lightly
recede
from
its
position
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
tax
united
states
citizens
who
were
working
for
the
commission.
the
reason
it
sought
to
tax
united
states
citizens
who
were
working
for
the
commission...
excuse
me,
in
the
commission...
was
that
that
was
a
reflection
of
its
sovereignty.
the
united
states,
on
the
other
hand,
never
viewed
the
issue
as
a
matter
of
tax
policy,
but
merely
as
a
political
problem
to
be
solved.
the
united
states
could
not
allow
panama
to
tax
united
states
citizen
employees
of
the
united
states.
it
would
create
an
untoward
precedent,
which
would
in
turn
adversely
affect
the
negotiating
posture
of
the
united
states
in
the
future.
in
addition,
the
internal
memoranda
of
the
government
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
there
was
fear
by
the
negotiators
that
if
they
acceded
to
the
panamanian
request
to
tax
these
corrects,
that
the
consequences
in
congress
would
be
rather
significant.
the
opposition
was
going
to
be
quite
clear.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
our
view
is
that
the
way
to
read
the
second
sentence
is
to
incorporate
by
the
language
"similarly",
which
is
what
precedes...
which
is
what
initiates
the
second
sentence.
it
says,
"similarly",
that
these
things
are
taxed.
and
that
is
derived...
what
that
refers
to,
excuse
me,
is
commission-related
income,
that
is
from
outside--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
supposed
they
could,
although
i
don't
know
that
they
would.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
not
terribly
bizarre,
your
honor.
the
primary
concerns
of
the
negotiators
were
the
sovereignty
over
the
commission,
and
so
the
bilateral
agreement
not
to
tax
any
income
either
directly
or
indirectly
arising
out
of
work
for
the
commission
was
the
primary
purpose
of
the
agreement
and
the
compromise.
the
fact
that
they
may
have
left
open
one
potential
for
u.s.
citizen
employees...
and
this
is
clearly
going
to
be
a
very
small
subset
of
people
who
are
u.s.
citizen
employees--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
the
commission.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
significantly
different
language
with
respect
to
military
personnel.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
except
for
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it's
not
easy
for
me
to
give
a
definitive
answer
on
that,
because
i
don't
know
about
the
negotiating
history
that
would
have
led
up
to
that
part
of
the
agreement.
based
on
the
language,
however,
there
is
clearly
a
significant
difference
between
article
15
implementing
article
3
and
article
16
implementing
article
4.
the
second
sentence--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
true,
justice
o'connor,
but
if
you
read
the
next
sentence,
which
is
the
sentence
that
grounds
article
16
into
panamanian
law,
"similarly,
as
provided
by
panamanian
law.
"
and
then
it
goes
on,
that
language
which
grounds
the
second
paragraph
of
article
16
to
panama
has
been
deleted
from
article
15,
thereby
taking
it
away
from
concern
specifically
with
respect
to
panama.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
my
basic
position
would
be
that
it
is
clearly
a
much
stronger
case
for
u.s.
taxation
of
the
military.
i
would
not
concede
that
it
has
to
be
that
way,
because
again,
even
if
that
language
might
support
no
tax
exemption,
you'd
have
to
go
to
the
negotiating
history,
and
that
we
don't
have
before
us.
in
fact,
we're
not
sure
that
the
government
has
ever
made
the
history
surrounding
article
16
available.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
united
states
has
entered
into
agreements,
none
of
which
have
been
ultimately
ratified
by
the
senate,
that
would
provide
for
some
bilateral
exemptions.
but
i
think
the
more
important
joint
is,
i
don't
think
there
is
anywhere
in
the
world
that
is
like
panama.
the
panama
canal
commission
creates
its
own
income.
this
income
does
not
come
from
the
united
states
treasury;
it
comes
from
the
panama
canal
commission's
tolls,
and
it
is
then
paid
over
to
united
states
employees.
the
whole
point
of
the
negotiations
and
the
compromise
during
those
negotiations
was
that
that
kind
of
income
ought
to
be
taxed
by
the
panamanians,
and
the
united
states
and
panama
compromised
on
that
issue.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
believe
we
have
to
read
the
second
sentence
that
broadly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
thought
in
my
response
to
justice
o'connor,
justice
scalia,
i
had
indicated
that
i
thought
you
could
incorporate
into
the
second
sentence
the
word
"similarly"
a
limitation
on
the
scope
of
the
second
sentence
referring
to
income
derived
from
commission-related
work,
but
from
outside
sources;
and
that
that's
a
much
narrower
and
clearly
less
important
provision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
it
follows.
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
word
"similarly".
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
except
that
there's
no
indication
that...
whine
it
may
be
able
to
as
a
matter
of
the
treaty,
i
don't
know
that
panama
has
ever
attempted
to
do
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
i
don't
know
that
it
was
a
concern
to
the
united
states
and
the
panamanian
negotiators.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the
best
example
of
it
would
be
the
annuitants
who
had
worked
on
the
canal
prior
to
the
treaty,
who
were
then
rehired
after
the
treaty,
because
their
income
for
work
on
the
canal
that
they
receive
as
annuitants
would
be
from
sources
outside.
it
comes
from
the
united
states,
but
that
would
then
be
exempt
from
taxation.
it
also
makes
good
policy
sense,
because
usually
those
are
individuals
who
are
very
highly
skilled
technicians
in
terms
of
working
at
the
canal
and
would
have
been
heavily
sought
after.
so
i
think
that
there
is
a
body
of
people
who
fall
within
that
category,
and
it
would
have
been
quite
reasonable
to
try
to
exempt
them.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
by
whom?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
i
would
understand
it,
the
united
states
could
tax
that
income,
under
my
interpretation.
now,
if
you
reject
my
interpretation
and
say
that
they
are
not
taxable,
that
the
limitation
of
"similarly"
permits
the
united
states
to
tax
and
is
only
a
limitation
on
panama,
then
obviously
it
is
a
little
skewed.
that
means
that
income
outside
the
united
states
would
be
taxable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
under
my
preferred
theory?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
that
that
was
not
a
serious
concern
to
the
government.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
justice
scalia,
the
problem
with
the
alternative
interpretation
is
that
then
you
have
to
go
back
and
say,
well,
what
does
the
first
sentence
mean?
and
it
is
the
first
sentence
that
was
clearly
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
the
negotiators
in
1977.
and
under
the
alternative,
any
other
alternative
interpretation
of
the
second
sentence
that
forces
the
united
states...
that
allows
the
united
statesm
to
tax
this
income,
you
have
to
assume
that
the
negotiators
for
panama
receded,
they
gave
up,
they
caved,
even
though
it
had
been
described
to
the
united
states
as
essentially
a
treaty-buster
if
the
sovereignty
of
panama
was
not
recognized.
the
debates
leading
up
to
the
final
agreement
consistently...
and
most
of
them
come
from
minister
royo...
indicate
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
reach
an
agreement
unless
the
sovereign
concerns
of
panama
were
taken
into
account.
so
that
any
other
interpretation
of
article
1
means
that
somewhere
between
the
last
messages
we
have
on
the
subject
and
the
final
agreement,
without
any
indication
that
panama
would
give
it
up,
had
completely
abandoned
its
interest
in
this.
it
makes
much
more
sense
to
assume
that
a
compromise
was
reached,
that
the
concerns
of
the
negotiators
for
the
united
states
were
not
based
on
tax
policy;
they
were
based
on
diplomatic
and
political
concerns.
those
negotiators,
who
are
diplomats
and
not
tax
lawyers,
had
one
uppermost,
or
two
uppermost
considerations.
the
first
one
was
that
they
be
able
to
get
this
treaty
through
the
congress,
which
they
could
not
do
if
panama
was
allowed
to
tax
these
citizens;
and
two,
that
they
not
be
in
a
position
where
this
would
cause
a
precedent
for
future
negotiations
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
taxation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
justice
stevens,
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
blue
brief.
it
does,
however,
appear
in
the
yellow
brief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
sir.
based
on
the
negotiating
history
and
the
compromise
that
was
reached,
the
language
of
article
15,
sentence
one...
paragraph
2,
sentence
one,
becomes
quite
clear.
it
was
clearly
chosen
to
provide
a
bilateral
exemption.
and
the
language
deleted
from
the
second
sentence,
which
would
have
made
it
refer
to
panamanian
law,
was
deleted;
and
that
deletion
was
significant,
and
from
that
we
can
immediately
support
that
basic
plain
meaning
argument,
that
a
bilateral
tax
exemption
was
supplied
here.
to
demonstrate
the
merit
of
that
interpretation,
based
on
the
traditional
standards
of
interpretation,
one
need
only
look
at
what
the
government
relies
upon
for
its
position
in
this
case.
interestingly,
it
never
even
cites
the
restatement
second
of
foreign
relations
law,
which
provides
a
set
of
traditional
criteria
ordinarily
employed
in
order
to
reach
an
understanding
as
to
what
the
parties
objectively
had
intended.
instead,
it
relies
largely
on
extra-treaty
and
extra-record
materials,
which
we
submit
cannot
overcome
the
plain
language
of
the
provision,
which
is
designed
to
provide
this
tax
exemption.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
most
recently
filed
document--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--from
the
official.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
have
never
received
a
copy
of
it,
so
it's
difficult
to
make
that
concession.
we
also
sought
to
find
it
published
in
the
tias
and
have
not
been
able
to
find
it
there,
either.
so
it's
difficult
for
us
to
know,
to
concede
that
point.
it
would
have
been
easier,
obviously,
if
it
had
been
supplied
to
the
claims
court
so
that
at
the
trial
level
those
matters
could
have
been
resolved.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
hesitate
to
say
that,
because
what
you
have
to
do
is
assume
that
the
government
may
have
been
acting
to
a
certain
extent
in
bad
faith
and
i
can't
do
that.
and
the
whole
point
of
the
problem
with
respect
to
that
note
is
that
the
government
never
brought
it
to
the
claims
court's
attention
through
the
ordinary
rules
of
litigation,
which
is
rule
60(b),
so
that
its
authenticity
could
have
been
established.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
in
this
instance
you're
saved
the
burden
of
having
to
worry
about
that,
because
even
the
note
under
any
circumstances,
that
note
cannot
serve
as
a
legitimate
basis
for
interpreting
the
treaty.
in
the
first
place,
the
most
that
you
can
derive
from
the
note
is
that
what
it
says
panama
believes
the
treaty
means
now,
which
is
eight
years
after
the
fact
and
is
therefore
very
little
evidence
of
what
the
parties
intended
in
1977.
second,
the
circumstances
underlying
the
note,
the
letters
themselves
which
purport
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
the
interpretation,
are
particularly
suspicious,
given
that
three
letters
come
from
the
individuals
who
did
not
directly
negotiate
article
15,
and
that
the
two
negotiators
of
article
15
were
not...
one
was
not
solicited,
his
views
were
not
solicited.
the
other
one,
his
views
were
solicited,
according
to
the
foreign
minister,
and
he
was
not...
and
no
letter
was
forthcoming
from
him.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
you
take
the
note
at
face
value,
that
would
seem
to
be
the
inference
you
would
draw.
but
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
what
the
united
states
and
panama
agree
today
is
of
little
effect
as
to
what
they
reached
an
agreement
about
in
1977.
if
the
united
states
and
panama
aren't
in
agreement
as
to
how
this
matter
ought
to
be
resolved
today,
in
light
of
the
new
administration
in
panama,
the
solution
to
that
problem
is
for
the
united
states
and
panama
to
reach
a
new
agreement
that
clarifies
this
issue,
not
simply
to
send
back
and
forth
a
diplomatic
note
that
is,
on
its
face
at
least,
intended
to
amend
an
agreement
reached
eight
years
previously.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
just
that
when
a
note...
no,
not
any
particular
reason,
other
than
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
note
are
suspicious.
i
mean,
in
terms
of
its
authenticity,
there's
no
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no,
i
don't
mean
to
indicate
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
an
authentic
note.
what
it
is
designed
to
achieve
is
not-at
all
clear.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
think
it's
absolutely
clear
that
that
was
not
that
position.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
of
today,
i
have
no
doubt
of
that.
whether
the
panamanian
government
might
supply
a
new
note
in
the
future
is
open
to
guess.
and
what
we
have
to
say
about
the
note,
at
least
as
a
litigating
matter,
aside
from
just
the
general
invalidity
of
notes
such
as
this
to
be
used
as
a
basis
for
overcoming
the
plain
meaning,
in
that
in
the
claims
court
judge
kozinski
asked
the
department
of
justice
attorneys
twice
if
they
were
going
to
provide
a
note.
indeed,
he
asked,
are
you
in
the
process
of
negotiating
a
note,
are
you
negotiating
a
note,
or
will
you
negotiate
a
note?
and
the
government
consistently
said:
no,
that
note
would
not
be
relevant
to
anything
in
this
case,
and
you
should
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
of
record
as
of
march
8th,
1984.
in
the
context
of
those
statements--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
would
be
largely
irrelevant.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
say
completely
irrelevant.
under
sumitomo--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--only
in
a
circumstance
where
the
note
clearly
supports
both
the
plain
meaning
of
the
agreement
and
the
understanding
of
the
united
states,
as
it
did
in
sumitomo.
when
the
note
is
being
used
to
impeach
the
understanding
of
the
parties--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
as
i
read
the
opinion
in
sumitomo,
the
court
said
that,
even
with
the
understanding
of
the
united
states
and
japan
and
the
plain
meaning,
that
still
didn't
end
the
inquiry
in
that
case,
and
the
court
went
on
to
examine
whether
or
not
there
was
some
additional
evidence
that
might
justify
a
different
interpretation
of
the
agreement.
i
would
be
inclined
to
agree
with
you
that
that
would
certainly
be
strong
evidence,
justice
scalia.
the
court
in
sumitomo
didn't
stop
at
that
point.
it
continued
on
in
its
analysis
of
the
traditional
criteria
for
interpreting
any
international
agreement.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
can
do
that,
but
it's
not
binding
on
this
court.
this
court's
judicial
function
is
to
interpret
the
agreement
and
the
understanding
reached
by
the
parties
in
1977.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
think
not,
not
if
it's
clear
that
the
original
understanding
of
the
parties
was
x.
if
one
of
the
parties
now
believes
y--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
instances
that
simply
because
on
party
to
the
agreement
has
abandoned
the
agreement,
okay...
in
santo
vincenzo,
italy
stopped
believing
that
citizens
should
be
extradictable
and
the
united
states
continued
to
believe
that
citizens
should
be
extradictable.
the
court
rejected
the
fact
that
italy
had
changed
its
position
as
obviating
the
government
from
fulfilling
its
obligations
under
the
treaty,
as
understood
by
this
court
based
on
the
traditional
criteria.
so
my
view
would
be
no,
that's
not
a
basis
for
this
court
to
disregard
the
understanding
reached
in
1977.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
say
i
would
be
in
a
lot
more
trouble
than
i
am
anyway.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
it's
not
that
it's
ambiguous.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
in
treaty
interpretation
is
never
controlling.
it's
not
like
a
contract,
justice
white.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
would
put
it
slightly
differently.
it
is
good
enough
to
create
a
presumption
that
the
other...
that
can
only
be
rebutted
by
reference
to
other
types
of
interpretative
aids,
such
as
the
negotiating
history.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
what
i
would
have
assumed--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--what
i
would
have
assumed--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
would
have
been
possible,
even
if
i
don't
know
why,
that
the
panamanian
government
simply
decided
to
recede.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
we
have
no
evidence
to
that
effect,
and
there
is
no
reason
at
all
to
believe
it.
and
in
the
face
of
such
strong
statements
in
favor
of
panamanian
sovereignty
on
this
case,
it
is
very
difficult
to
draw
an
inference
that
they
would
have
simply
caved,
as
the
government's
interpretation
requires
the
court
to
assume.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
white.
it
is
not
sufficient
that
the
plain
language
supports
us.
we
must
also
demonstrate
that
the
structure
and
the
history
support
us,
and
that
i
suggest
we
have
done.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
couple
points.
first,
mr.
ganzfried
consistently
tells
the
court
that
the
negotiating
history
preceding
this
agreement
contains
no
discussion
of
united
states
domestic
taxation.
but
at
the
very
end
of
his
comments
he
discusses
the
tax
credit
issue.
when
the
united
states
responded
to
a
proposal
for
a
domestic
tax
credit,
the
united
states
negotiators
didn't
say:
we
don't
negotiate
about
domestic
income
taxes
with
foreign
governments.
they
said:
that's
a
matter
of
money,
that's
a
financial
issue.
that's
fully
consistent
with
our
view
that
the
sovereignty
concerns
that
were
paramount
among
the
state
diplomats
were
protected
in
order
to...
by
conceding
away
the
tax
concerns.
as
mr.
ganzfried
said,
this
was
not
a
tax
proposal.
these
were
not
tax
lawyers
who
negotiated
this
treaty.
second,
with
respect
to
justice
white's
question
concerning
who
has...
to
whom
is
deference
owed
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
the
treaty,
there
is
evidence
from
the
panama
canal
commission
supervisory
board
that
it
did
understand
this
treaty
to
provide
a
bilateral
tax
exemption.
that
board
denied
a
cost
of
living
increase
to
all
of
these
employees
in
part,
by
the
foreign
minister
who
presented
this
note
to
the
united
states,
for
reasons
that
he
said
clearly;
that
there's
an
exemption
already
for
u.s.
taxes;
they
are
not
entitled
to
any
additional
allowances,
they
don't
need
that;
they've
gotten
all
of
the
protection
they
have.
and
that
cost
of
living
adjustment
was
denied,
largely
on
the
basis
of
that.
so
the
only
agency
that
really
does
implement
this
particular
agreement
has
reached
that
conclusion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
on
the
instructions
of
the
united
states
government,
yes,
they
have
been.
but
then
of
course,
there's
a
method
for
finally
resolving
that,
and
that's
in
this
forum.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
that
was
based
on
their
understanding
of
what
the
treaty
meant.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
except
to
the
extent...
the
general
counsel
hasn't,
but
the
supervisory
board
acted
pursuant
to
that
understanding
of
what
the
implementing
agreement--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
the
nine-member
board
that
administers
the
panama
canal
commission,
the
five
united
states,
four
panamanians.
and
it
does
have
day
to
day
responsibility,
and
it
did
understand
this
treaty
to
provide--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
certainly
that
would
be
true,
but
my
clients
are
not
in
a
position
to
obtain
a
protest
from
the
government
of
panama.
the
only
method
by
which
they
can
seek
to
resolve
this
issue
is
through
the
courts,
and
that's
what
they've
done.
until
it's
finally
resolved,
i'm
not
sure
why
panama
would
necessarily
protest.
there's
no
reason
to
protest
until
the
final
decision
is
made
as
to
what
will
happen
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
white.
and
specifically
in
the
o'connor
brief,
we
go
through
the
materials--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
the
o'connor
brief.
there
is
an
extensive
discussion,
with
very
clear
quotations
from
minister
royo
setting
out
specifically
the
sovereign
issues
that
were
of
central
concern
and
why
this
was
in
fact.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
specifically
mentioning
a
tax
credit
as
one
of
the
specific
proposals,
yes.
