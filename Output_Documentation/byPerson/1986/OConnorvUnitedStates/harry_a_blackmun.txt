why
does
it
exist
all
of
a
sudden?
certainly,
the
government
solicited
the
note,
did
it
not?
justice
harry

blackmun
well,
of
course,
the
opposition
is
suspicious
to
the
contrary.
justice
harry

and
feels,
i
suppose,
that
it's
a
quid
for
a
quo--
justice
harry

--actually,
to
wit
the
grant
in
aid.
justice

all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there's
a
little
bit
of
stickiness
in
the
case
when
representations
were
made
to
the
claims
court,
judge
kozinski,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
government
turns
over
and
produces
a
note.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
i'm
saying
is
i
think
the
case
isn't
as
clear
as
you
would
make
it
out
to
be.
