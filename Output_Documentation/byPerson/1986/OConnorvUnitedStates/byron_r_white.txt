justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
government
had
answered
different,
had
said,
yes,
we
are
trying
to
get
a
note,
and
judge
kozinski
said,
well,
let
me
know
when
you
get
it,
and
the
united
states
came
up
with
precisely
this
same
note?
under
your
position,
it
would
be
irrelevant
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
largely?
well,
it's
completely
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
this
note
we
have
now
is
not...
is
somewhat
relevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
phillips,
suppose
the
negotiating
history
that
you
rely
on
here
was
just
to
the
contrary,
that
it
indicated
rather
clearly
that
panama
said:
okay,
if
you
insist
we
won't
tax,
but
you
can.
and
then
they
came
cut
with
this
precise
language.
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
with
that
negotiating
history,
but
this
language,
that
you
could
say
this
language
is
ambiguous?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right,
right.
all
right,
so
that
your
plain
language
argument
is
only
good
insofar
as
the
negotiating
history
supports
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
think
if
the
negotiating
history
supported
the
views
of
your
opponent
and
yet
they
used
this
language
to
express
their
agreement,
you
would
almost
think
that
in
between
the
last
meeting
and
the
writing
there
had
been
some...
something
you
don't
know
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
according
to
your
position,
this
language
really
means
what
it
says.
and
yet,
if
the
negotiating
history
were
to
the
contrary,
something
must
have
happened.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
have
happened
here,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
this
language
is
subject
to
some
interpretation.
you
say
these
international
agreements
are
really
subject
to
some
interpretation
from
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
language
does
say
"from
any
taxes",
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
the
negotiating
history
just
isn't
subject
to
the
interpretation
that
your
opponent
puts
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
we
interpreted
the
negotiating
history
contrary
with
your
view
of
it
and
consistent
with
your
opponent's?
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
stick
to
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
stick
to
the
question.
what
if
the
negotiating
history
should
be
interpreted
as
your
opponent
says?
then
would
you
still
insist
that
this
language
be
interpreted
the
way
you
insist
that
it
should
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
say,
well,
put
the
negotiating
history
aside,
here
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--just
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
just
the
way
the
treaty
has
operated
from
the
beginning.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
always
withheld,
ever
since
the
treaty
was
signed?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
objection
from
panamanians?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
your
view
that
it's
always
been
the
view
of
the
panamanian
government.
that's
what
i
get
from
what
you've
said--
justice
byron
r.
white
--from
the
outset,
that's
what
the
parties
understood
this
treaty
to
mean,
and
they
didn't
object
to
your
withholding
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
this
note
represents
exactly
what
the
panamanians
have
thought
all
along.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
why
you
didn't
say
in
the
claims
court:
well,
this
is
also
the
view
of
the
panamanian
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
have
thought
you'd
have
said,
well,
we
know
what
their
view
is
and
it's
consistent
with
ours,
why
don't
we
ask
them.
