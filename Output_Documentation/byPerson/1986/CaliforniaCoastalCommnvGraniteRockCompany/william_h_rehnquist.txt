mr.
masouredis,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
case
really
comes
to
us
in
quite
an
abstract
position.
just
what
sort
of,
if
it's
possible
to
say
from
the
record,
what
sort
of
questions
is
california
going
to
ask
in
this
permit
proceeding?
what
sort
of
restrictions
or
conditions
would
it
put
on
the
permit
that
was
given
to
the
respondent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
danger
of
runoff
from
the
federal
land
to
the
other
lands
not
owned
by
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
many
citizens
of
california
want
to
visit
a
mining
operation
that's
mining
limestone
or
something?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
you
think
it's
permissible
under
this
scheme
that
we're
talking
about
here
for
the
state
to
say
that,
we
want
this
federal
piece
of
land
to
be
kept
up
to
snuff
and
appealing
to
visitors,
in
keeping
with
the
big
sur
countryside?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
to
the
extent
that
the
forest
service
incorporates
state
regulations
the
state
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
it,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
could
substantially
modify
the
value
of
the
land
use
classification
given
by
the
forest
service.
if
the
forest
service
says
you
can
prospect
or
mine
limestone
on
this
claim
and
the
state
of
california
can
come
along
and
say,
well,
you
can't
mine
limestone
in
a
particular
manner,
is
that...
do
you
go
that
far?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
really
think
there
is
that
air-tight
compartment...
i
think
justice
scalia
suggested
to
you
this
in
his
question...
between
designating
the
use
of
the
land
on
the
one
hand
and
designating
the
environmental
aspects
of
the
use
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
this
action
was
brought
in
the
district
court
by
your
opponents
to
enjoin
you
from
exacting
any
sort
of
a
permit
requirement,
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
really
went
into
what
that
permit
requirement
required,
did
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
a
sense,
i
suppose
you're
entitled
to
prevail
if
any
sort
of
permit
requirements
that
might
reasonably
be
conceived
of
would
not
be
entirely
preempted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
your
view,
if
california
could
impose
any
sort
of
requirement
at
all
as
a
condition
of
its
permit,
you
want
to
prevail
here,
because
that
was
really
the
only
issue
before
the
courts
below?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
masouredis.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
banke.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
your
opponent
i
don't
think
agrees
with
you,
ms.
banke.
he
says
that
he
agrees
they
don't
have
the
right
to
say
you
can't
mine.
he
says
that
they
may
want
to
attach
conditions
relating
to
the
environment
to
the
mining
operation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
was
it
that
stark?
as
i
read
the
last
paragraph...
we're
talking
about
the
letter
of
october
17th,
1983?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
"granite
rock
is
hereby
notified
of
its
obligation
to
submit
for
coastal
commission
review
and
approval
a
certification
of
consistency
with
the
state's
coastal
management
program
and
for
any
future
plan
of
operations.
"
is
it
your
view
that
you
simply
could
not
have
submitted
any
such
certificate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
just
a
permit,
and
we
don't
know
from
this
record
what
sort
of
conditions
the
commission
might
have
imposed
in
exchange
for
a
permit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
the
mining
regulations
such
that
these
people
could
ultimately
patent
this
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
now
they
have
a
right
of
occupancy
and
a
right
to
pursue
their
mining
activities?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
federal
lands
in
the
coastal
zone
are
less
subject
to
state
regulation
that
federal
lands
outside
the
coastal
zone?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
banke.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
seem
to
know
a
good
deal
more
about
what
the
california
coastal
commission
might
require
as
a
condition
of
this
permit
than
a
lot
of
other
people
in
the
case.
can
you
be
that
confident
that
nothing
it
might
require
would
be
permissible?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
been
waived
in
this
case,
hasn't
it?
the
consistency
check?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mienar.
mr.
masouredis,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
masouredis.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-1200,
california
coastal
commission
versus
granite
rock
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
