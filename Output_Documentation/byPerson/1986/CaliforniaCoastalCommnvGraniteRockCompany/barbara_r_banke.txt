ms.
barbara
r.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
all
environmental
regulations
by
a
state
are
preempted.
the
issue
that
was
presented
at
the
court
below
is
whether
coastal
development
permit
jurisdiction
over
these
mining
claims
on
federal
lands
is
preempted.
and
there
is
a
difference,
i
believe,
between
environmental
standards,
which
the
state
definitely
has
the
right
to
impose
and
does
impose
via
the
forest
service
in
the
permitting
process
by
the
federal
government,
and
a
coastal
development
permit,
which
we
believe
is
an
impermissible
veto
power
on
the
right
of
the
federal
government
to
define
the
use
of
the
federal
lands.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
your
honor,
there
is
no
purpose
for
the
permitting
process
other
than
an
intent
by
the
coastal
commission
to
control
the
use
of
these
lands,
because
the
coastal
commission
already
has
the
right,
as
does
the
state
of
california,
to
set
environmental
standards
for
air
quality
and
water
quality,
solid
waste
management,
fire
prevention.
these
standards
are
applied
by
the
forest
service
through
the
approval
process
of
a
plan
of
operations,
and
were
applied
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
the
forest
service
regulations
state
that
the
forest
service
is
to
apply
state
and
federal
standards.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
i
believe
they--
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
--i
believe
that
the
forest
service
does
have
discretion
to
ascertain
whether
those
regulations
are
an
unreasonable
constraint
on
the
use
of
the
federal
lands.
so
i
believe
that
they
do
have
some
discretion.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
the
use
of
the
federal
lands.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
but
in
this
case--
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
--i
believe
that
we
do
quibble
with
the
state
of
california
over
whether
it
may
in
this
case
impose
a
coastal
development
permit--
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
--on
the
use
of
these
lands.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
yes,
through
those
standards,
and
those
have
been
applied.
that
is
not
what
granite
rock
is
quarreling
about.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
well,
it's
a
major
dispute
to
granite
rock.
the
reason
that
we're
here
is
because
when
we
received
the
letter
telling
granite
rock
that
it
had
to
apply
for
a
coastal
development
permit,
it
was
already
two
years
into
its
mining
operation
pursuant
to
the
federal
plan
of
operations,
and
it
had
been
subjected
to
state
and
federal
standards.
when
it
received
the
letter,
it
had
a
choice
of
either
shutting
down
the
mining
operation
or
subjecting
itself
to
possible
coastal
development
penalties,
which
are
severe
and
can
range
as
much
as
$5,000
a
day.
so
this
is
a
live
controversy
in
our
view.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
your
honor,
it
is
not
the
consistency
review
aspect
of
that
letter
that
we're
challenging.
i
believe
in
the
paragraph
immediately
preceding
that
which
you
read
it
states
that
granite
rock
must
apply
for
a
permit.
so
they
are
making
two
requirements
in
that
letter:
one
is
that
granite
rock
seek
consistency
review
for
any
amendments
to
the
plan
of
operation;
and
the
second
is
that
granite
rock
seek
a
coastal
development
permit.
now,
formerly
at
issue
was
whether
granite
rock
had
to
seek
consistency
review,
but
the
coastal
commission
admitted
at
an
early
stage
that
that
was
waived,
because
they
had
had
actual
notice
of
the
plan
of
operations
but
did
not
act
upon
it
within
the
time.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
that
is
correct,
except
insofar
as
i
believe
they're
disingenuous
when
they
say
they
would
only
apply
water
or
air
quality,
because
those
were
already
applied
and
would
already
be
applied
in
a
consistency
review
of
any
future
plan
of
operations.
what
a
coastal
development
permit
is
is
a
permit
for
development,
and
development
is
defined
by
the
california
coastal
act
as
a
change
in
use
or
the
intensity
of
use.
and
we
believe
that
that
is
an
impermissible
power
given
to
the
state
of
california
to
control
the
use
of
these
federal
lands.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
no
consistency
review
was
sought
at
the
earlier
stage.
we
do
have
a
new
plan
of
operations
and
it
is
possible
that
it
will
come
up
in
that
context.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
i
do
not
know.
actual
notice
was
given.
perhaps
they
did
not
have
any
objection
to
the
environmental
review
at
that
time.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
it
can
administer
its
environmental
laws
through
standards
which
are
applied
to
these
lands
and
to
the
mining
on
these
lands
through
consistency
review.
in
consistency
review
the
congress
thought
that
it
was
giving
the
states
an
incentive
to
enter
into
a
state's
coastal
planning
process,
because
the
state
could
provide
the
type
of
input
into
the
federal
approval
that
would
give
it
some
meaningful
participation.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
i
believe
that
the
state
would
have
a
problem
in
that
context
and
would
have
a
dispute
with
the
federal
government
over
the
standards
it
seeks
to
apply.
i
do
believe
that
the
federal
government
has
the
last
word.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
if
the
federal--
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
--i
believe
that
they
can
go
to
court.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
yes,
because
the
forest
service
has
a
duty
to
enforce
the
standards.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
i
believe
it
can
if
the
company
is
not
complying
with
the
standards.
there
is
no
allegation
here
that
the
company
is
not
complying
with
the--
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
--i
believe
that
the
federal
government
would
have
the
last
word
and
would
prevail
in
that
case,
if
in
fact
the
company
was
complying
with
the
standards.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
well,
i
believe
that
they
would
prevail
in
court.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
if
the
government
of
the
united
states
could
show
that
granite
rock
was
in
compliance,
i
believe
that
they
would
prevail.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
the
court
would
decide,
in
my
opinion.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
yes,
i
believe
that
would
be
the
case.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
if
the
forest
service
was
incorrect
in
applying
the
standards.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
at
the
administrative
level,
i
believe
the
forest
service
would
decide.
but
then
perhaps
there
would
be
a
case
or
controversy
where
the
state
could
take
the
forest
service
to
court.
but
that
is
not
what
we
are
challenging
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
no.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
we
have
stated
in
undisputed
affidavits
and
in
the
plan
of
operations
itself,
which
is
in
the
appendix,
it
is
stated
that
the
state
standards
were
applied
for
air
quality
and
water
quality.
and
there
has
been
no
allegation--
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
--even
so,
the
state
wants
a
permit,
yes.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
yes,
that
is
my
point,
justice
white.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
yes.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
technically,
i
believe
the
state
could
consider
that
an
environmental
concern.
but
the
forest
service
regulations
provide
that
the
state
standards
on
four
subjects
shall
be
considered,
and
those
are:
air
quality,
water
quality,
solid
waste
management,
and
fire
protection.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
shall
be
applied.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
shall
apply,
shall
be
applied.
i
believe
that
the
last
word
as
to
whether
they
have
been
applied
and
complied
with
is
in
the
forest
service,
however.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
only
those
that
applied
at
the
time
of
the
permit,
i
believe,
until
a
new
permit
was
sought.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
could
change
the
standard.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
i
believe
that
they
cannot
go
beyond
that.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
yes.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
these
are
federal
lands,
and
pursuant
to
the
property
clause
congress
is
to
have
the
full
authority
to
control
the
use
and
disposition
of
these
lands.
i
believe
justice
scalia
is
correct
when
he
says
the
distinction
between
land
use
and
environmental
controls
might
be
difficult
to
apply.
perhaps
the
coastal
commission
might
say
that
a
large
scale
mining
operation
is
not
something
that
is
a
suitable
use
for
this
land.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
ultimately,
if
all
goes
well
in
the
exploratory
phases
of
the
mining
operation
which
granite
rock
is
currently...
was
engaged
in
prior
to
the
letter
and
would
re-engage
in
if
approval
of
the
plan
of
operations
is
obtained,
yes,
ultimately
they
can
patent.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
yes,
they
do
have
a
right
of
occupancy
and
to
pursue
the
mining
activities.
the
forest
service
still
controls
the
surface
of
the
lands
and
those
lands
are
still
open
for
surface
uses
that
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
mining.
factually,
this
mining
operation
is
approximately
five
miles
inland
from
the
coast.
it
is
not
visible
from
the
coast,
and
it
is
not
in
an
area
that
is
widely
traveled
by
the
public.
it
is
in
an
area
which
is
fairly
remote.
the
mining
claimants
on
federal
lands
have
historically
not
been
subject
to
a
state's
land
use
controls
or
zoning
controls.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
no.
if
pollution
of
a
state
waterway
was
involved,
i
believe
the
state
could
enforce
its
laws.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
if
the
company
was
engaged
in
what
would
be
a
nuisance,
pollution
of
the
waterway,
the
state
could
enforce
it.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
there
are
several
things
that
do
the
preempting
in
my
opinion.
the
clearest
preemption
is
in
the
coastal
zone
management.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
the
mining
law--
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
--that
is
correct,
it
would
not
prohibit
that
type
of
regulation.
i
believe
that
it
would
preempt
the
coastal
development
permit,
because
that
is
a
permit
which
is
related
to
the
use
of
the
land,
and
which
is
triggered
by
a
change
in
the
use
of
the
land.
and
the
forest
service
regulations
would
also
preempt.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
i
do
not
believe
that
independently
it
would
be
binding,
because
it
is
already
provided
for
in
the
forest
service
regulations.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
then
it
might
apply.
but
in
this
case
i
believe
that
the
forest
service
regulations
provide
for
a
unified
application
of
state
and
federal
reclamation
standards.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
yes.
yes,
it
is.
i
believe
that
congress
has
spoken
and
that
inconsistent
state
laws
must
recede.
the
coastal
zone
management
act,
however,
is
the
clearest
example
of
preemption,
because
there
it
states
in
the
federal
lands
exclusion
that
federal
lands
are
excluded
from
a
coastal
zone.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
no,
i
believe
that
that
statement
is
consistent
with
law,
that
it
is
a
clear
exposition
of
the
law,
that
a
state
may
not
control
the
use
and
disposition
of
the
lands.
but
in
that
case,
congress
has
clearly
spoken
to
say
that
permit
regulation
over
federal
lands
by
a
state
coastal
commission
is
prohibited.
and
the
coastal
commission
has
asserted
that
it
is
not
just
under
the
federal
coastal
zone
management
act
and
its
coastal
act.
however,
it
in
the
joint
appendix
has
stated
that
its
regulations...
in
the
original
coastal
management
program
of
the
state
of
california,
it
stated
that
it
was
within
the
federal
coastal
zone
exclusion
and
that
it
would
abide
by
that
exclusion.
it
is
not
abiding
by
the
exclusion
any
more.
instead,
it's
seeking
judicial
modification
of
what
it
had
previously
agreed
to
do.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
the
regulations
i
don't
believe
contain
that
statement.
that
was
contained
in
the
plan
of
operations.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
and
that,
there
are
two
reasons.
a
necessary
permit
is
a
permit
that
is
not
preempted,
and
the
coastal
zone
permit
in
this
case
is
preempted
by
the
coastal
zone
management
act
and
the
forest
service
regulations.
ms.
barbara
r.
banke
i
don't...
it
is
not
conceded.
my
second
point
is
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
forest
service
operator
has
the
right
to
bind
the
united
states
in
that
plan,
when
it
is
clear
from
the
forest
service
regulations
that
there
is
to
be
a
unified
system
of
approval,
with
the
state
requirements
considered
before
the
approval
is
given
by
the
forest
service.
