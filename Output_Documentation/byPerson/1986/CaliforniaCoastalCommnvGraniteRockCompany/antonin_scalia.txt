justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
being
done
apart
from
the
czma
program?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
may
not
be
the
same
program,
but
it
is
certainly
the
same
sort
of
coastal
zone
management
scheme,
as
opposed
to
a
separate
environmental
statute
dealing
with
one
or
another
type
of
environmental
damage.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
states
can
do
the
same
thing
by
a
coastal
zone,
a
state
coastal
zone
management
program
that
is
not
part
of
the
federal
program,
what
possible
purpose
does
the
exclusion
of
the
federal
lands
from
the
federal
coastal
zone
management
program
achieve?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
principle
you,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
in
principle
you
would
say
that
damage
to
the
federally
owned
land
itself
would
justify
the
state
environmental
regulation,
even
though
no
non-federally
owned
land
is
affected
by
that
damage?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
avoid
the
preemption
by
the
coastal
zone
management
act,
you
really
have
to
rely
heavily
on
the
distinction
you
were
drawing
earlier
between
land
use
restrictions
and
environmental
restrictions.
is
that
a
realistic
distinction?
i
mean,
suppose...
prohibition
of
strip
mining,
is
that
a
land
use
restriction
or
an
environmental
restriction?
justice
antonin
scalia
without
regard
to
environmental
impacts?
but
you
make
that
determination
usually
on
the
basis
of
environmental
impact,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
what
basis
do
you
zone?
justice
antonin
scalia
"to-mae-to,
tom-mat-to".
you
call
them
amenities,
i
call
them
environmental
impacts.
aren't
they
the
same
thing
you're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you
can
say,
yes,
you
can't
break
the
surface
of
the
land.
that's
an
environmental
regulation,
right?
but
if
you
said
no
strip
mining,
that
would
be
a
land
use
regulation;
is
that
the
distinction
you
want
us
to
adopt?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
be
they're
both
directed
to
precisely
the
same
thing.
you
restrict
the
land
use
because
of
the
environmental
considerations,
and
to
try
to
sever
environmental
laws
from
land
use
laws
seems
to
me
very
artificial.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
it
prohibit
strip
mining?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
prohibit
strip
mining,
but
not
mining?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
saying...
it
isn't
prohibiting
all
mining;
it's
just
prohibiting
strip
mining.
you
can
mine
so
long
as
you
do
it
by,
you
know,
by
subterranean
methods,
the
breaking
of
the
surface.
now,
that's
not
prohibiting
mining.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
state
could
prohibit
strip
mining?
justice
antonin
scalia
permitting,
to
go
back
to
the
distinction
you
seek
to
draw,
the
validity
of
which
i'm
not
so
sure
about,
the
permitting
is
a
permitting
of
use,
right?
you
cannot
use
the
land
for
mining
without
getting
the
california
permit.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
may
be
a
vehicle
for
that,
but
what
you
permit
is
the
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
of
course
you
can
deny
a
permit.
what's
the
purpose
of
a
permitting
program
unless
you
can
deny
a
permit?
you
mean
every
application
for
a
permit
has
to
be
granted?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
when
you
deny
a
permit
you
are
denying
a
particular
use.
you're
saying
no
mining,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
we're
saying
the
same
thing.
you
can
deny
them
a
permit
until
they
shape
up
their
environmental
operation.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
is
this
just
as
a
matter
of
grace
or
you
think
the
forest
service
has
to
apply
state
environmental
regulations?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
i
asked.
i
know
the
regulations
state
that.
must
they
state
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
those
state
laws
apply
ex
proprio
vigore,
as
we
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure.
you
say
that
they
apply
of
their
own
force,
unless
they
unduly
inhibit
the
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
they
unduly
inhibit
the
use
of
the
federal
lands.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
basically,
as
far
as
the
application
of
the
state
environmental
laws
are
concerned,
you
don't
disagree
with
the
state
of
california?
you're
just
quibbling
over
whether
this
is
an
environmental
law,
that's
all.
that's
all
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
did
this
by
ordinary
application
of
their
environmental
laws
and
moved
in
on
the
mining
company
on
the
basis
of
some
other
statute
than
this
particular
one,
you'd
say
exactly
what
the
state
of
california
says,
that
they
can
do
it
so
long
as
it
doesn't
unduly
inhibit
mining,
whatever
that
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
very
small
dispute
we
have
before
us,
then,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
that
we
agree
that
california
can
impose
its
environmental
laws,
but
cannot
impose
a
permit.
how
does
it
administer
its
environmental
laws?
are
you
giving
the
state
something
that's
of
no
value
whatever?
how
does
it
administer
its
environmental
laws
without
a
permitting
system?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
discretionary
with
the
federal
government.
i
mean,
the
forest
service
can
say,
we
disagree
with
you
that
this
is
inconsistent
and
we're
going
to
go
ahead
and
allow
the
plan
this
way.
you're
saying
the
state
has
its
own
sovereign
power
to
apply
its
environmental
laws.
so
it
says,
we
want
this
in
consistency
review.
the
forest
service
says,
we
won't
give
it
to
you.
now
the
state
wants
to
apply
its
environmental
laws.
how
does
it
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
federal
government,
as
i
understood
justice
white's
question,
the
federal
government
says
they're
complying,
but
the
state
thinks
that
they're
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
aren't
there
other
environmental
considerations
besides
air
and
water
quality?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
such
as,
you
know,
removing
a
whole
hillside
that's
there
on
the
big
sur?
that's
not
a
nice
thing
to
do.
couldn't
the
state
consider
that
an
environmental
concern?
justice
antonin
scalia
shall
be
considered
or
shall
be
applied?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
shall
apply?
shall
apply
automatically?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
am
really
confused.
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
you
do
not
contest
the
state's
power
on
its
own
to
apply
its
own
environmental
laws.
but
now
you
seem
to
be
saying,
in
response
to
the
more
recent
questions,
that
they
can't,
that
they
can't
go
beyond
what
they
succeeded
in
getting
the
forest
service
to
put
in
the
forest
service
regulations,
or
in
the
permit.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
latter,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
they
weren't
polluting
a
state
waterway.
that
makes
it
too
easy,
because
the
waterway
normally
would
go
off
of
the
federal
lands
onto
the
state
lands.
suppose
all
they
do
is
they
strip
mine
and
do
not
reclaim
by
reseeding
what
they
have
stripped,
and
the
state
has
a
law
requiring
reclamation
of
the
stripped
land.
would
that
law
be
binding?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
was
adopting
justice
white's
forest
primeval
hypothesis.
you
know,
we
have
the
federal
mining
law,
but
there
is
no
federal
environmental
regulation
whatever.
none
exists.
there's
no
coastal
zone
mining
act.
no
coastal
zone
mining
act,
no
federal
laws
at
all.
there
is
nothing
out
there
to
control
people
unless
the
state
law
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
banke,
what
do
you
do
about
the
regulations
that,
as
i
recall,
they
require
that
the
mining
company
have
obtained
all
necessary
permits,
which
seems
to
refer
to
state
permits?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
permit
wouldn't
be
preempted?
i
mean,
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
the
states
have
no
power
to
require
a
permit,
period,
of
mining;
that
the
federal
government
has
authorized
mining
and
you
don't
need
a
state
permit.
but
here
is
a
plan
that
says
you
have
to
have
all
necessary
permits,
and
i
think
it's
conceded
that
that
includes
state
permits.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
weren't
california
coastal
zone
management
program?
do
you
agree
with
mr.
masouredis
that
this
would
be
a
different
matter?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
just
on
the
chance
that
we
don't
all
agree
with
you
on
that,
what
if
california
has
a
separate
environmental
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
they
bear
upon
mining
use
and
even
though
they
require
a
preliminary
permit?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
california
could
essentially
achieve
what
it
wanted
to
do
here
by
just
putting
in
a
different
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
not
confront
the
problem
of
having
inland
states
more
restricted
than
coastal
states
by
reason
of
the
coastal
zone
management
act.
what
you
say
is
that
both
inland
and
coastal
states
can
apply
their
environmental
laws;
the
only
thing
is
that
coastal
zone
acts,
which
are
coastal
zone
programs,
can't
conflict
with
the
federal
one
or
augment
the
federal
one?
