mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
submits
that
the
czma
provides
a
direct
and
dispositive
answer
to
the
present
dispute.
the
czma's
federal
lands
exclusion
exempts
all
federally
owned
land
from
direct
regulation
under
state
coastal
management
programs.
the
federal
lands
exclusion
is
fully
applicable
in
this
case
and
requires
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below.
our
analysis
begins,
of
course,
with
the
czma.
the
czma
was
enacted
to
encourage
the
states
to
develop
state
land
use
management
programs
for
the
coastal
zone.
the
california
coastal
act
is
california's
coastal
zone
management
program,
and
as
such
it
is
subject
to
the
czma's
federal
lands
exclusion
set
forth
in
section
304,
which
excludes
from
state
regulation
lands
the
use
of
which
is
subject
solely
to
the
discretion
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
depends
on
the
source
of
the
law
that
california
is
seeking
to
impose.
the
issue
in
this
case
deals
directly
with
the
coastal
development
permit
required
under
the
coastal
act
of
california.
our
view
is
that
that
is
the
same,
the
very
same
program
as
the
czma-approved
program.
that
was
our
understanding
at
the
time
we
approved
it.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
other
environmental
laws...
california
may
have
other
environmental
laws
that
impose
permitting
requirements.
in
those
cases,
they
may
very
well
be
applicable
to
federal
lands.
that
will
require
and
individual
preemption
analysis
depending
on
the
requirements
of
that
particular
permit.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
examples
of
these:
for
example,
california
does
impose
water
quality
permits
for
discharges
into
navigable
waters.
now,
we
believe
that
those
permits
could
be
applied
to
federal
lands,
primarily
because
it
will
have
an
effect
off
the
federal
lands.
there
is
in
fact
an
effect,
an
external
effect
outside
of
the
federal
lands.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
could
with
respect
to
what
we
view
as
pollution
control
requirements.
it's
a
different
matter
with
respect
to
land
use
restrictions,
and
we
believe
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
land
use
requirements
and
pollution
control
requirements.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
we
have
to
judge
the
statute
based
on
what
the
california
coastal
act
provides,
and
the
california
coastal
act
provides
that
any
development
within
the
coastal
zone
must
obtain...
any
developer,
must
obtain
a
coastal
development
permit.
in
order
to
obtain
a
coastal
development
permit,
the
developer
has
to
show
that
his
development
is
consistent
with
the
local
coastal
program.
the
local
coastal
program
has
a
land
use
plan.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
this
is
something
apart
from
the
consistency
review
requirements.
these
are
the
actual
requirements
of
the
california
coastal
act.
the
statute
itself
says
that
in
order
to
obtain
a
development
permit
you
must
show
consistency
with
the
local
coastal
plan,
in
this
case
the
big
sur
land
use
plan.
now,
that
plan
is
a
land
use
plan.
it
prescribes
and
prohibits
particular
land
uses.
now,
california
says
at
this
juncture
that
they
would
not
apply
it
in
that
manner,
but
i
think
we
have
to
judge
the
case
on
the
basis
of
what
the
statute
in
fact
says.
california
really
contends
that
the
federal
lands
exclusion
in
this
case
is
inapplicable
for
two
reasons:
first,
the
original
argument
that
they
made
was
that
the
statutory
exclusion
does
not
apply
to
federal
lands
that
are
subject
to
a
mining
claim.
this
contention
is
the
contention
that
was
set
forth
in
the
letter
that
was
originally
sent
to
granite
rock,
that
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
22
to
23.
now,
this
contention
i
think
all
agree
now
is
plainly
wrong.
federal
lands
that
are
subject
to
mining
claims
remain
in
federal
ownership
and
hence
are
excluded
lands
within
the
meaning
of
the
czma
regulations.
the
coastal
commission
also
argues
that
the
federal
lands
exclusion
does
not
limit
the
commission's
authority
in
this
case
because
the
coastal
act
is
an
exercise
of
the
state's
inherent
police
power
that
exists
independently
of
the
czma.
that
is
the
ground
that's
offered
primarily
by
the
state
at
this
juncture.
but
the
czma
clearly
contemplates
that
once
a
state's
coastal
management
program
is
approved
it
will
provide
a
singular
and
complete
coastal
management
program
for
the
state's
coastal
zone.
there
is
no--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--justice
scalia,
we
suggest
this
is
a
bit
of
a
red
herring
here,
because
a
mining
development
100
miles
inland
is
subject
to
the
same
regulations
of
the
california
regime
that
a
similar
mining
development
inland
would
be
subject
to.
in
other
words,
we're
talking
only
about
the
coastal
zone
in
this
case.
but
california
also
has...
its
environmental
laws
can
be
applied
to
an
inland
mine,
and
those
would
be
applicable
in
this
case
as
well
and
would
be
outside
the
coastal
development
program
which
is
of
central
concern
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
we
think
that
that
is
the
clearest
and
easiest
solution
for
this
case.
returning
again
to
california's
statement
that
they
have
independent
power
to
impose
their
coastal
act,
i
think
the
important
thing
to
remember
here
is
congress
really
would
have
had
no
purpose
for
establishing
the
coastal
zone
management
act
in
those
circumstances.
it
provides
federal
funding
and
consistency
review.
those
incentives
are
the
core
of
the
coastal
zone
management
program.
in
return,
it
gets
compliance
with
the
regulations
that
are
set
forth
in
the
program.
and
for
example,
the
consistency
review
process
would
be
pointless
if
a
state
could
impose
its
regulatory
regime
directly
as
an
exercise
of
inherent
police
power.
there'd
simply
be
no
point
in
imposing
a
consistency
review
process
on
federal
lands.
the
czma
expressly
states
that
federal
approval
of
the
state
coastal
management
program
is
conditioned
on
state
compliance
with
the
federal
rules
and
regulations
that
govern
the
czma
programs,
and
those
regulations
include
the
czma's
federal
lands
exclusion.
the
fact
that
the
states
may
retain
authority
to
regulate
federal
lands
under
other
state
statutory
regimes,
such
as
the
clean
water
acts
statute
i
alluded
to
either...
earlier
before,
is
beside
the
point.
the
california
coastal
act
is
a
federally
approved
czma
program.
it
must
comply
with
the
pertinent
czma
regulations.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--california
waived
that
opportunity
in
this
particular
case,
and
it
will
have
that
opportunity
again
when
granite
rock
submits
a
new
plan
of
operations.
in
the
federal
government's
view,
that
is
a
permit
within
the
meaning
of
section
307
and
therefore
it
is
subject
to
consistency
review
requirements
of
section
307.3.
i
think
it's
also
worth
pointing
out
here
that
california
at
the
time
that
it
sought
its
czma
approval
expressly
stated
that
federal
lands
would
be
excluded
from
the
california
state
zone,
state
coastal
zone.
this
appears
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
106.
and
although
california
later
amended
its
statute,
that
amendment,
we
were
instructed,
amounted
only
to
a
technical
change,
did
not
amount
to
any
substantial
amendment
in
their
coastal
zone
program.
if
it
had
amounted
to
such
a
change,
they
would
have
had
to
have
sought
an
amendment
approval
from
noaa
through
the
czma
regulations.
these
are
set
forth
at
933.80
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
could
not
have...
in
our
view,
it
could
not
have
required
a
land
use
permit.
it
could
have
required
pollution
control
permits
of
various
kinds.
however,
it
simply
does
not
have
the
power
under
the
statutes
that
are
already
in
effect
that
govern
the
forest
service
lands
and
the
blm
lands
to
impose
land
use
requirements.
it's
essential
in
the
national
interest
that
the
federal
government
retain
control
of
the
ultimate
use
of
federal
lands.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
