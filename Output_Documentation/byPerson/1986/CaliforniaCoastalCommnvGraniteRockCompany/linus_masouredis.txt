mr.
linus
masouredis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
which
held
that
california's
environmental
regulation
under
the
california
coastal
act
of
granite
rock's
limestone
mining
on
federal
forest
lands
was
preempted
by
the
forest
service's
surface
use
regulations
and
by
the
1872
mining
act.
now,
before
getting
to
the
facts
i'd
like
to
try
and
summarize
the
three
points
that
we
hope
to
make
in
this
argument:
first,
the
state
is
not
seeking
to
prohibit
all
mining
by
granite
rock,
nor
does
the
state
claim
the
authority
to
be
able
to
determine
what
are
permissible
and
prohibited
uses
of
federal
lands.
the
state
accepts
mining
as
a
given
federally
defined
and
federally
authorized
use
of
this
property,
and
it
seeks
to
apply
the
environmental
controls
in
the
coastal
act
to
this
mining
to
minimize
the
adverse
environmental
effects
of
that
given
federally
authorized
use.
and
while
these
environmental
controls
happen
to
be
included
in
the
coastal
act,
they're
no
different
than
environmental
and
reclamation
controls
that
many
other
western
states
have
been
routinely
applying
to
private
mining
on
federal
lands
over
the
years.
secondly,
the
test
for
preemption
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
state's
environmental
regulation
duplicates
that
of
the
forest
service.
there
are
many
areas
where
federal
regulation
is
not
intended
to
be
exclusive
and
where
duplicative
state
regulation
not
only
doesn't
conflict
with
federal
regulation,
but
actually
furthers
federal
regulatory
objectives.
we
believe
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases.
the
ninth
circuit
we
believe
applied
an
erroneous
preemption
rule
because
it
essentially
concluded
that
the
state's
regulation
inherently
undermined
the
forest
service's
authority
simply
because
the
state's
regulation
duplicated
the
forest
service
regulation.
finally,
the
third
point,
to
us
it
appears
as
if
the
relevant
question
under
the
coastal
zone
management
act
is
not
whether
the
lands
granite
rock
is
mining
fall
within
the
definition
of
excluded
federal
lands
within
the
meaning
of
16
u.s.c.
section
14531.
rather,
to
us
the
relevant
question
is
in
excluding
federal
lands
from
the
coastal
zone
for
purposes
of
the
coastal
zone
management
program
did
congress
intend
to
preempt
the
police
power
authority
that
states
otherwise
have
over
private
activities
on
excluded
federal
lands,
and
which
states
can
enforce
apart
from
the
czma
program
under
their
police
power.
mr.
linus
masouredis
yes,
it
is.
the
coastal
act
is
an
independent
police
power
statute.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
found
that.
the
act
was
enacted
in
1976
and
the
state
was
enforcing
it
long
before
the
coastal
zone
management
program
was
approved.
and
even
if
the
state
for
some
reason
pulls
out
of
the
coastal
zone
management
program
or
if
the
federal
government
terminates
our
authorization,
the
state
will
continue
to
enforce
the
coastal
act.
mr.
linus
masouredis
well,
i
think
again
that
public
resources
code
30,008
indicates
that
the
state
will
apply
the
environmental
controls
of
the
coastal
act
to
excluded
federal
lands.
and
a
coastal
zone
program
is
something
that
the
state
devises
on
its
own.
it
can
include
whatever
statutes
that
it
wants
in
the
coastal
zone
management
program.
if
those
meet
the
federal
criteria,
the
federal
government
will
approve
it.
but
the
statutes
themselves
aren't
enforced
solely
through
the
coastal
zone
management
program.
they
had
an
independent
existence
to
begin
with.
that's
how
they
got
included
in
the
management
program.
they
had
to
be
enacted
as
police
power
statutes
initially,
and
those
statutes
can
be
enforced
wholly
independent
of
the
coastal
zone
management
program.
it's
a
voluntary
program.
states
aren't
required
to
join
up,
and
the
statutes
that
they
include
in
the
program
don't
have
to
be
enforced
solely
through
the
management
program.
mr.
linus
masouredis
as
we
see
it,
the
czma,
adds
to
the
state's
police
power.
it
doesn't
detract
and
limit
it.
and
the
purpose
of
14531
was
a
congressional
judgment
not
to
delegate
to
states
the
authority
to
define
permissible
and
prohibited
uses
of
federal
lands.
the
czma
itself
tells
a
state
that
it
must
include
in
its
management
program
a
definition
of
permissible
land
and
water
uses.
now,
that's
the
equivalent
of
zoning.
that's
the
ability
to
go
out
and
say:
this
is
a
use
that
will
occur
here,
this
use
won't
occur
there.
that's
what
we
call
land
use
determination
power.
states
don't
have
that
under
their
police
power.
they
can't
ordinarily
do
that
to
federal
lands.
and
i
think
congress
by
enacting
the
excluded
lands
provision
said,
we're
going
to
withhold
that
delegation
of
authority
and
states
can't
define
permissible
land
and
water
uses
on
federal
lands.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
everything
that
happens
to
be
included
in
the
management
program
can't
be
applied
to
federal
lands,
because
for
example
the
czma
says
that
a
management
program
must
include
the
air
and
water
quality
requirements
of
the
federal
clean
air
and
water
act.
and
we
don't
understand
granite
rock
or
the
solicitor
general
to
be
arguing
that
those
things
which
are
in
the
management
program
cannot
be
applied
to
excluded
federal
lands.
mr.
linus
masouredis
i
think
the
things
they
would
be
looking
at
are
reclamation
for
the
mining
that's
occurred,
measures
to
prevent
pollution
into
the
little
sur
river.
there's
overburden
stored
in
particular
areas.
there's
a
danger
of
erosion,
runoff
from
the
road
from
the
overburden.
the
little
sur
river
runs
in
close
proximity
to
this--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--into
the
little
sur
river.
the
mining
is
occurring
on
mount
pico
blanco
and
there's
an
extreme
slope
of
about
48
degrees,
and
the
little
sur
river
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
canyon,
about
2,000
feet
from
where
the
overburden
is
stored.
so
there
is
a
potential
hazard.
mr.
linus
masouredis
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
the
state's
citizens
use,
visit,
and
enjoy
federal
lands,
and
that
the
state
does
have
an
interest
in
environmental
degradation
on
site
on
federal
lands,
in
addition
to--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--well,
this
particular
area,
the
big
sur
coast
of
california,
is
very
scenic
and
attracts
roughly
three
million
visitors
a
year.
so
that
the
visitors
would
not
be
coming
to
see
the
particular
mining
operation,
but
again
the
operation
is
located
in
the
heart
of
the
big
sur
coast
of
california,
in
close
proximity
to
malara
state
park,
the
ventana
wilderness,
the
little
sur
river
that
runs
out
to
the
coast.
mr.
linus
masouredis
we
think
that
we're
interested
in
having
additional
supplemental
environmental
controls
to
complement
the
forest
service's
own
surface
use
requirements.
and
indeed,
the
forest
service's
regulations
incorporate
a
number
of
state
police
power
environmental
rules,
such
as
air
and
water
quality
and
public
safety
and
public
health
requirements,
fire
laws.
and
so
to
us
it
appears
as
if
that
the
forest
service
itself
relies
upon
state
environmental
regulation
as
a
means
to
attain
the
forest
service's
own
surface
protection
interests.
it's
not
simply
a
question
of
the
state
furthering
its
own
interests,
but
we
think
those
two
were
very
complementary.
mr.
linus
masouredis
well,
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
it
doesn't
appear
that
that
is
the
case.
we
read
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
as
saying
that
it's
now
discretionary
with
the
forest
service
to
pick
and
choose
which
particular
environmental
controls
it
wants
to
apply.
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
the
state
enforcement
was
the
problem.
any
permit
enforcement
was
what
was
prohibited,
and
therefore
it
said
the
forest
service
is
the
only
one
that
does
the
enforcement.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
there
are
very
limited
forest
service
personnel,
thousands
of
claims
scattered
on
millions
of
acres.
and
the
ranger
in
the
field
is
unfamiliar
with
state
environmental
and
police
power
requirements.
he
doesn't
have
the
time,
the
familiarity,
or
the
expertise
to
apply
them.
and
so
we
think
that
as
it
stands
now
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
we
are
not
assured
that
there
will
be
any
state
environmental
enforcement.
mr.
linus
masouredis
i
think
the
difference
between
a
land
use
determination
type
of
regulation
and
an
environmental
one
is
in
the
land
use
context
the
analysis
is,
we're
going
to
define
what
are
acceptable
uses,
without
regard
to
environmental
impacts.
we
just
make
a
decision
that
residential
use
or
commercial
use
is
or
is
not
allowed
in
certain
areas--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--not
really,
not
really.
first,
land
use
determination
is
essentially
a
zoning
type
decision,
and
that
really
is
without
regard,
whereas--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--certain
amenities,
decisions
about
where
the
community
should
grow.
mr.
linus
masouredis
i
think
an
environmental
regulation
is
one
that
says,
regardless
of
what
the
use
is...
and
it
can
be
any
use...
it
has
to
meet
certain
environmental
standards.
so
i
think
analytically
there
is
a
different
operation
that
occurs
when
you're
using
a
land
use--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--well,
if
you've
said
that
certain
activities
can't
occur
because
of
the
environmental
effects,
we'd
agree
that
that
might
blend
over.
any
time
you
have
a
clean
air,
clean
water
act
requirement,
that
might
mean
that
a
particular
factory
can't
be
built
because
it
can't
meet
those
standards.
and
so
the
effects
might
be
in
certain
cases
similar.
but
i
think
analytically
the
two
kinds
of
analyses
are
different.
mr.
linus
masouredis
i
think
the
important
thing
here
is
whether
or
not
the
state
is
going
to
absolutely
prohibit
the
particular
use
we're
concerned
about,
which
is
mining.
and
we've
conceded
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
lawsuit
that
the
state
cannot
impose
an
absolute
prohibition
on
mining
because
that's--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--that's
correct.
mr.
linus
masouredis
oh,
no.
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
no,
the
state
could
not
prohibit
mining
on
these
federal
lands.
mr.
linus
masouredis
that's
right,
but
it's
defining
a
particular
type
of
mining.
yes,
that's
what
we're
arguing,
that
the
state
can
impose
certain
kinds
of
controls.
mr.
linus
masouredis
yes,
a
certain
type
of
mining,
but
not
all
mining
per
se.
mr.
linus
masouredis
we're
not
intending
to
interfere
with
any
of
the
designations
for
the
use
of
the
land.
we're
seeking
to
apply
a
regulation
just
to
control
how
the
use
is
carried
out.
mr.
linus
masouredis
no,
i'd
agree
that
at
a
certain
point
there
might
be
certain
circumstances
where
the
state's
environmental
regulation
could
conceivably
be
too
onerous
and
could
affect
the
actual
mining
use,
the
ability
to
carry
out
the
mining
use
on
federal
lands.
we'd
agree
that
at
that
point
the
regulation
has
gone
too
far.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
question
that's
presented
here
in
this
case.
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
granite
rock
couldn't
comply
with
any
reasonable
coastal
commission
permit
requirements.
mr.
linus
masouredis
that's
correct,
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
linus
masouredis
again,
the
consistency
review
provisions
deal
with
the
effects
that
activities
on
federal
lands
have
offsite
on
non-federal
lands.
the
consistency
review
is
limited
to
those
offsite
effects,
and
that
is
different
that
the
kind
of
review
the
state
would
have
over
effects
on-site,
on
federal
lands.
so
it's
a
different
scope.
and
in
addition,
i
just
point
out
that
even
as
to
off-site
effects
there
is
some
question
whether
the
state
could
adequately
regulate
those
as
well
under
consistency,
as
it
could
under
its
direct
police
power,
because
there's
a
particular
legal
test.
the
state
has
to
demonstrate
for
consistency
purposes
that
the
activities
on-site
are
likely
to
have
effects
off-site.
and
in
the
real
world
there
are
oftentimes
very
indirect,
multi-causal
relationships,
so
that
activities
on-site
don't
have
these
direct
off-site
effects.
so
consistency
review
is
not
a
substitute,
we
believe,
for
direct
permit
regulation
under
the
police
power.
mr.
linus
masouredis
well,
we
believe
the
district
correctly
decided
that
question,
but
we
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
it
here.
we
think
we
can
win
this
case
even
if
these
lands
are
excluded
federal
lands,
because
we
think
the
question
is
did
the
czma--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--for
purposes
here,
yes,
we
would.
we
do
believe
that
the
district
court
correctly
decided
it,
but
we
think
we
can
win
the
case
even
if
they
are
viewed
as
excluded.
mr.
linus
masouredis
i
think,
but
i
think
that
question
is
directly
answered
by
the
federal
czma
regulations
that
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
adopted,
15
cfr
923.
mr.
linus
masouredis
well,
we
think
we
can
win
the
case
even
if
they
are
excluded,
because
the
czma
doesn't
preempt
the
state's
inherent
police
power,
and
this
coastal
act
is
a
police
power
statute.
mr.
linus
masouredis
yes,
it
could,
it
could.
but
i
think
the
evidence
really
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
regulations,
and
in
the
express
savings
clause
of
the
statute
indicates--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--this
is
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration.
mr.
linus
masouredis
yes,
and
they
administer
the
czma
program.
and
that
regulation
directly
says
that,
in
excluding
federal
lands
for
the
purposes
of
the
czma
program
a
state
does
not
impair
whatever
authority
it
has
over
federal
lands
apart
from
the
czma
program.
mr.
linus
masouredis
well,
no,
they
didn't
mention
that
provision,
that
regulation.
their
argument
is
directed
to
the
excluded
lands
question,
not
the
preemptive
intent
behind
the
czma.
mr.
linus
masouredis
well,
it
is
based
on
the
idea
that
the
excluded
lands
question--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--controls.
mr.
linus
masouredis
no,
neither
one.
mr.
linus
masouredis
yes.
we
think
that
this
court
in
the
takings
cases
in
fact
has
addressed
this,
this
ripeness
issue,
in
cases
like
agins,
san
diego
gas
&
electric,
williamson
county,
and
mcdonald,
sumner
&
frates,
and
has
said
that
the
court
won't
consider
whether
the
state
regulation
has
gone
too
far
until
the
state
has
had
an
opportunity
to
make
a
final
decision
exactly
how
its
regulation
will
be
applied
to
a
particular
landowner
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
linus
masouredis
that's
correct,
yes.
that's
our
position.
mr.
linus
masouredis
the
permit
is
a
vehicle
for
attaching--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--well,
we've
conceded
that
we
can't
deny
the
use.
so
that's
the...
we
can't
deny
a
permit.
and
so
the
permit
is
being
used
solely
to
include--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--no,
only
when
there's
a
preemption
limit
and
when
we
can't
deny
a
particular
federally
authorized
use.
mr.
linus
masouredis
yes,
that's
correct.
but
again,
we've
conceded
in
this
case
that
we
cannot
deny
this
mining
company,
who
is
operating
on
federal
lands,
a
permit.
the
permit
is
being
used
solely
to
include
environmental
conditions
on
the
operation.
mr.
linus
masouredis
right,
yes.
the
criteria
for
applying
is
whether
they've
included
these
environmental
controls.
now,
to
briefly
describe
the
facts.
granite
rock's
mining
is
occurring
just
inside
the
boundaries
of
the
los
padres
national
forest.
the
forest
service
approved
the
plan
of
operation
in
1981.
the
forest
service
stated
in
its
approval
of
the
plan
and
in
its
modifications
that
granite
rock
should
obtain
necessary
state
permits.
in
its
environmental
assessment,
the
forest
service
also
indicated
that
granite
rock
should
obtain
any
necessary
coastal
commission
permits.
i
just
wanted
to
touch
on
one
additional
fact
and
let
the
court
know
that
the
1981
plan
of
operation
has
expired.
it
expired
last
year.
but
the
case
is
not
root
in
our
view
because
there
is
a
live
dispute
as
to
the
need
for
mitigation
and
reclamation
conditions
for
the
mining.
mr.
linus
masouredis
the
plan
of
operation.
the
forest
service
issued
a
plan
of
operation
for
this
mining.
but
the
mining
company
has
admitted
doing
mining
after
the
date
of
the
commission's
letter
informing
them
that
they
needed
a
permit,
and
therefore
there
is
a
live
controversy
as
to
the
need
for
reclamation
and
mitigation
conditions
for
the
mining
that
occurred
after
the
date
of
that
letter.
i
think
in
the
remaining
time
i
have
i
would
just
like
to
again
emphasize
that
the
coastal
zone
management
act
in
this
case
is
a
statute
which
supplements
the
state's
police
power
authority.
it
wasn't
intended
to--
mr.
linus
masouredis
--they're
not
mining
right
now.
i
believe
they
have
plans
to
submit
an
application
for
a
new
plan.
mr.
linus
masouredis
yes.
and
i
think
they're
in
the
early
stages
of
preparing
an
environmental
impact
statement
for
future
mining
activities.
mr.
linus
masouredis
yes,
yes.
the
czma
is
essentially
a
statute
which
adds
to
the
state's
police
power
authority.
it's
not
one
that
replaces
it.
and
i
think
to
conclude
otherwise
would
lead
to
very
bizarre
results.
it
would
mean
that
those
inland
states,
like
colorado
and
wyoming
and
montana,
which
have
been
regularly
applying
environmental
controls
to
private
mining
activities
on
federal
lands
can
continue
to
do
so
because
they're
unaffected
by
the
czma,
whereas
those
coastal
states
which
chose
to
participate
in
the
czma
program
are
stripped
of
that
police
power
authority.
it
would
also
mean
that,
even
within
the
state
of
california,
there
is
a
bizarre
distinction
between
the
state's
ability
to
apply
regulatory
controls
in
the
inland
portion
of
the
state,
federal
lands
in
the
inland
portion,
but
that
within
the
coastal
one
the
state's
police
power
is
collapsed
within
the
confines
of
the
czma
program.
and
we
don't
see
that
there
is
any
evidence
of
that
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
language
of
the
czma
statute.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
linus
masouredis
yes,
very
briefly.
first
of
all,
i
think
we
have
a
disagreement
as
to
what
the
terms
are
of
the
coastal
act
itself
and
the
permitting
process.
the
coastal
act
has
two
types
of
permitting
processes.
one
occurs
when
a
local
coastal
program
has
been
reviewed
and
certified,
the
implementing
ordinances
have
been
approved,
and
then
permit
authority
devolves
upon
the
local
government
to
issue
permits
in
accordance
with
its
local
coastal
program.
that's
not
at
issue
in
this
case
at
all.
we're
dealing
with
the
second
type
of
permitting,
which
is
by
the
coastal
commission
itself,
not
a
local
government.
the
coastal
commission
is
the
party
involved
here,
not
the
county
of
monterey.
and
what's
being
enforced
is
the
coastal
act
itself,
not
the
monterey
land
use
plan.
the
coastal
act
has
a
number
of
environmental
performance
standards
in
chapter
3
of
the
act,
and
the
coastal
commission
issues
permits
based
upon
compliance
with
the
environmental
criteria
in
the
coastal
act
itself.
so
i
think
there's
a
misconception
here
as
to
what
the
permitting
process
is.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
local
government
issuing
permits
in
accordance
with
the
local
land
use
plan.
secondly,
the
coastal
act
is
not
enforced,
as
i
tried
to
indicate
earlier,
solely
through
the
coastal
zone
management
program.
it's
an
independent
statute.
it
was
enacted
in
1976.
federal
approval
came
in
1977.
the
state
was
enforcing
that
act
wholly
apart
from
the
czma
program.
and
if
you
took,
for
example,
the
assumption
that
the
state
pulls
out
of
the
coastal
zone
management
act
system...
that's
a
voluntary
system.
the
state
can
withdraw
from
it
at
any
time.
if
we
pulled
out
of
that
system,
this
statute
wouldn't
collapse,
the
coastal
commission
wouldn't
go
out
of
business.
it
would
be
enforcing
this
as
a
state
statute.
so
i
think
the
solicitor
general's
attempt
to
tie
this
statute
into
the
czma
and
say
that's
the
only
existence
to
this
statute
is
basically
incorrect.
now,
in
addition
the
argument
is
made
that
the
state
is
bound
by
the
federal
rules
under
the
czma
and
that
we
therefore
have
to
enforce
this
statute
in
accordance
with
the
czma
rules.
but
one
of
the
federal
czma
regulations
is
923.33(c)(2)
at
15
code
of
federal
regulations.
and
that
very
provision,
which
was
adopted
by
the
federal
government,
tells
states
that
in
excluding
federal
lands
for
purposes
of
the
coastal
zone
management
program
they
retain
their
police
power
authority
over
those
federal
lands.
and
so
we
don't
believe
that
california
has
violated
the
terms
of
the
czma
program.
we've
simply
availed
ourselves
of
the
right
to
apply
our
police
power
to
federal
lands.
that's
something
that
the
federal
government
has
expressly
noted,
that
we
have
that
authority.
mr.
linus
masouredis
yes,
it
is.
there
was
a
question
raised
about
the
forest
service
regulations
and
about
the
reference
to
compliance
with
state
permits.
that
is
in
the
actual
forest
service
decision
in
this
case.
it's
not
in
the
regulations.
but
the
regulations
do
point
out
that
state
approvals
and
certifications
will
be
accepted
as
compliance
with
parallel
requirements
of
the
forest
service
regulations.
and
that's
section
228.8(h),
and
that
section
is
based
on
the
assumption...
i
see
that
my
time
is
expired.
