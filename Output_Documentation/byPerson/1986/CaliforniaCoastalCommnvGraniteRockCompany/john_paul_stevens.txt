but
does
that
mean
that
if
the
state
during
the
existence
of
a
permit,
after
you've
been
mining
for
a
couple
of
years,
decided
to
make
the
standards
a
little
more
strict,
would
you
have
to
comply
with
the
more
strict
standard
or
only
those
that
applied
at
the
time
you
got
the
permit?
justice

so
that
the
state
could
not
change
the
standard?
