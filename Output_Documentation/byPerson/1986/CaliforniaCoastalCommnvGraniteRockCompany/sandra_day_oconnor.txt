justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
really
have
nothing
before
us
here
to
tell
us
how
demanding
the
california
coastal
commission
would
be
that
has
jurisdiction,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
think
the
purpose
of
the
consistency
review
provisions
in
czma
are
if
the
state
has
this
independent
power
to
regulate
that
you
assert?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
concede
that
the
land
at
issue
here
held
under
the
mining
claim
of
granite
pock
fits
within
the
definition
of
czma
which
excludes
lands
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
federal
government
or
held
in
trust
by
the
federal
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
are
willing
to
concede
that
they
are
in
that
definition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
minear,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
of
course
didn't
go
off
on
the
czma
ground
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
take
it
you
are
urging
that
we
decide
the
case
on
a
ground
not
decided
or
discussed
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
minear,
has
california
attempted
to
engage
in
a
so-called
consistency
review
process
to
make
its
coastal
zone
management
provisions
applicable
to
federal
lands
such
as
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
they
make
that
effort
through
the
consistency
review
process?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
mining
act
of
1872
authorizes
private
citizens
to
enter
federal
lands
to
perfect
mining
claims.
appellee,
granite
rock
company
holds
an
unpatented
mining
claim
on
federal
land
in
california.
granite
rock
obtained
approval
of
the
from
the
forest
service
to
mine
limestone.
but
the
california
coastal
commission
told
granite
rock
it
must
also
apply
for
a
development
permit
from
the
coastal
commission.
granite
rock
filed
suit
against
the
commission
in
the
federal
district
court
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
on
the
grounds
that
federal
laws
preempted
california's
laws
and
regulations.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
commission's
permit
requirement,
which
enforce
state
environmental
standards
with
preemptive
by
the
mining
act
in
the
forest
service
regulations.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
our
view,
neither
the
forest
service
regulations
nor
federal
land
use
statutes
nor
the
coastal
zone
management
act,
preempt
the
california
commission's
imposition
of
a
permit
requirement
to
enforce
reasonable
environmental
requirements
on
operation
of
the
mining
claim
on
federal
lands.
this
action
comes
to
us
in
the
form
of
a
facial
challenge,
to
any
state
regulation
and
we
have
no
occasion
here
to
review
any
specific
application
of
california's
requirements.
