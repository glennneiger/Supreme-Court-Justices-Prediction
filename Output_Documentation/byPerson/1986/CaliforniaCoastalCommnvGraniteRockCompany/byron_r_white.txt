justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
you
construed
the
language
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
as
congressional...
a
statement
of
congressional
intent
to
exclude
any
state
regulation,
the
case
would
be
over,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
you
don't
concede
for
this
case
that
these
lands
here
have
been
excluded
under
the
czma?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
could
if
congress
intended
it
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
puts
out
the
regulations
you're
talking
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
the
department
of
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
united
states...
and
i
suppose
it's
representing
the
commerce
department...
says
you're
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
their
argument
is
a
preemption
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
go
back
to
that
point.
is
the
company
now
mining?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
forest
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
controversy
isn't
dead,
you
say,
and
if
this
particular
one
is
it's
going
to
recur
very
soon?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
state
has
given
its
input
and
the
plan
of
action
or
of
operation
wholly
satisfies
the
state
as
it
is
issued.
but
does
the
state
then
have
some
independent
power
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
federal
permit?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
they
send
an
inspector
out
there
and
your
client
just
isn't
living
up
to
the
permit,
the
federal
permit.
can
they
go
to
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
enforce
their
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
the
forest
service
says,
you're
all
wrong,
mr.
inspector,
they're
completely
complying
with?
then
there's
a
case
or
controversy,
i
suppose.
can
california
then
go
to
court
and
allege
that
and
try
out
whether
the
company
is
complying?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
a
judge
wouldn't?
a
judge
wouldn't
have
the
last
word?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
the
united
states
has
to
do
is
to
go
in
and
move
to
dismiss
the
action,
saying:
they're
just
wrong;
they
are
in
compliance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
decides?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
there
is
a
trial
and
the
government
says
they're
complying,
your
client
says
they
are
not?
and
then
the
judge
decides?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
judge
could
then
rule
and
say,
mr.
forest
service,
you're
dead
wrong,
granite
rock
is
not
complying?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
decides?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
any
allegation
here
that
the
plan
of
operation
that
was
issued
did
not
contain
the
state
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
agreement
that
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
so,
the
state
wants
a
permit?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
so
they
could
enforce
the...
why
would
they
need...
they
wouldn't
need
a
permit
to
enforce
those
standards,
i
gather
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there
was
no
federal
coastal
act
and
no
plan
of
operation
at
all.
there
was
just
a
mining
claim
under
which
the
company
was
occupying
the
claim
and
mining.
and
the
state
came
in
and
said:
by
the
way,
you're
dirtying
up
this
river;
we
want
you
to
stop
it;
you
have
to
comply
with
our
state
law;
let's
read
it.
and
the
company
says:
yes,
we
are,
if
that
law
applies,
we're
violating
it.
would
you
say
that
the
state
was
exceeding
its
power
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
as
far
as
the
federal
government
was
concerned
it
was
mining
and
it
was
doing
a
permissible
job
of
mining?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you...
take
it
then
you
say
it's
the
federal
coastal
zone
act
that
does
the
preempting.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
mining
law
by
itself
wouldn't.
the
mining
law
by
itself
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
said
it
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
is
the
act
and
the
regulations
that
do
the
preempting
primarily.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
coastal
zone
act,
i
suppose
california
could
have
required
a
permit
for
this
mining
development?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
regulation
in
your
brief?
