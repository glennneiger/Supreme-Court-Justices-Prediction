mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
at
the
center
of
this
case,
section
405
of
the
surface
transportation
assistance
act
of
1982,
prohibits
an
employer
in
the
motor
transportation
industry
from
retaliating
against
an
employee
who
asserts
his
right
to
safe
working
conditions.
the
statute
authorizes
the
secretary
of
labor
to
investigate
an
employee's
complaint
that
the
statute
has
been
violated,
and
when
the
secretary
finds
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
employer's
action
violated
the
statute
he
must
issue
a
preliminary
order
directing
the
reinstatement
of
the
employee
and
awarding
other
appropriate
relief.
if
the
employer
objects
to
the
secretary's
order,
he
is
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge
regarding
the
reasons
for
the
discharge.
the
secretary
issues
a
final
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
developed
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
and
the
secretary's
decision
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
particular
feature
of
section
405
that
is
in
dispute
here
is
congress'
determination
that
employees
should
be
provided
with
preliminary
as
well
as
permanent
relief.
the
statute
states
that
an
employee
must
be
reinstated
on
an
interim
basis
if
the
secretary
finds
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
his
discharge
was
in
violation
of
the
statute.
this
interim
reinstatement
remains
in
effect
during
the
subsequent
evidentiary
hearing
and
through
the
resolution
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
the
question
presented
here--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
the
statute
does
indicate
that,
set
a
60
day
limit.
but
the
secretary
interprets
that
limitation
as
directory,
rather
than--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
secretary
ignores
that
requirement,
just
in
some
cases
it
happens
that
the
investigation,
the
questions
are
complex
or
witnesses
are
difficult
to
locate.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
this
particular
case
involved
many
different
claims
by
mr.
hufstetler
that
he'd
engaged
in
a
variety
of
safety-related
activities.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
mention
that,
that
case,
brock
against
pierce
county,
which
involved
a
similar
statutory
time
limit,
which
the
court
interpreted
as
directory
and
non-mandatory.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
statutory
scheme
would
be...
indicates
itself
that
the
same
rules
should
apply.
if
the
time
limit
was
interpreted
to
divest
the
secretary
of
jurisdiction,
then
the
secretary's
failure
to
act
would
cut
off
the
employee's
rights,
and
it
couldn't
be
that
congress
intended
that
a
statute
that
was
intended
to
help
employees
would
fail
if
the
secretary,
because
of
lack
of
administrative
resources
or
just
the
complexity
of
the
particular
investigation,
wasn't
able
to
complete
the
investigation
within
that
time
period.
congress
obviously
wanted
to
protect
employees.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
but
the
back
pay
obligation
runs
from
the
discharge.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
length
of
the
investigation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
he
doesn't
owe
the
back
pay
until
after
the
entire...
there's
been
a
final
adjudication
on
the
merits.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
the
only
part
of
the
order
that
goes
into
effect
immediately
on
the
reasonable
cause
finding
is
the
reinstatement.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
other
remedies
don't
go
into
effect
until
the
order
becomes
final.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor,
the
employers
are
protected
by
the
thoroughness
of
the
investigation,
because
the
secretary's
determination
becomes
that
much
more
accurate,
and
so
his
reasonable
cause
finding--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--is
that
much
more
accurate.
just
to
briefly
consider
stating
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
proceeding
began
on
november
22nd,
1983,
when
appellee
discharged
jerry
hufstetler,
who
was
one
of
its
truck
drivers,
on
the
ground
that
he
had
intentionally
disabled
his
truck
to
obtain
extra
pay.
hufstetler
filed
a
grievance
under
his
collective
bargaining
agreement,
asserting
that
he
had
been
discharged
in
retaliation
for
his
safety
activities,
and
after
his
grievance
was
rejected
he
filed
a
complaint
with
the
secretary
under
section
405.
the
secretary
conducted
his
investigation,
which
took
eleven
months,
and
in
the
course
of
that
investigation
appellee
was
informed
of
the
charges
and
the
complaint
and
given
an
opportunity
to
present
its
side
of
the
story.
the
secretary
issued
a
reasonable
cause
finding
and
directed
that
hufstetler
be
reinstated
on
a
temporary
basis
pending
the
completion
of
the
proceedings.
eleven
days
after
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
order,
appellee
commenced
this
action
in
federal
district
court.
it
sought
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
temporary
reinstatement
order
on
the
ground
that
the
order
violated
appellee's
due
process
rights.
the
district
court
issued
the
injunction
and
held
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
the
secretary
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
issuance
of
the
temporary
reinstatement
order,
and
that
section
405
was
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
that
it
permitted
the
issuance
of
such
an
order
without
the
prior
hearing.
now,
both
sides
in
this
case
agree
that
an
employer
is
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
prior
to
a
final
determination
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
discharge.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
hearing
must
be
held
before
the
discharged
employee
is
temporarily
reinstated
or
afterward,
and
in
our
view
the
due
process
clause
as
it
has
been
interpreted
in
this
court's
cases
does
not
preclude
congress
from
authorizing
a
temporary
reinstatement
prior
to
an
evidentiary
hearing.
now,
this
constitutional
question
is
not
new
to
the
court.
in
a
line
of
recent
cases,
the
court
has
considered
the
question
of
the
timing
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
connection
with
an
interim
or
temporary
deprivation
of
liberty.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
we
do,
although
let
me
add
that
we
think
the
nature
of
the
property
interest
is
quite
insubstantial
as
compared
to
the
property
interests
that
the
court
has
considered
in
its
prior
cases.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
interest
as
we
see
it
is
the
employer's
right
to
discharge
an
employee
that
it
has
under
its
contract.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
rely
on
any
particular
case.
let
me
add
that
if
there
were
no
reinstatement,
obviously
if
the
employer
was
just
required
to
pay
money
in
the
interim,
then
that
payment
of
money
itself
would
be
a
loss
of
property.
in
this
case,
since
there
is
reinstatement
the
employer
gets
a
day's
work
for
a
day's
pay,
and
so
really
the
only
diminution
in
his
rights
is
this
question
of
being
able
to
control
the
workplace,
which,
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
is
already
subject
to
quite
a
lot
of
federal
regulation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
order...
the
back
pay
obligation
does
not
become
effective
until
the
order
is
finally
upheld.
but
eventually,
if
the
discharge
were
found
to
be
unlawful,
he
would
be
required
to
pay
back
pay.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
yes,
your
honor.
that's
why
we--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
that's
why
we
think
there's
a
property
interest
here.
but
we
think
that
in
assessing
the
weight
of
that
interest
it's
necessary
to
see
exactly
what
the
employer
is
losing,
and
we
think
it's--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
we
think
it's
something,
but
we
don't
think
it's
anything
like
a
person
who
needs
disability
not
getting
disability
benefits
or
an
employee
being
discharged
or
someone
who
is
dependent
on
money
for
their
livelihood
losing
that
very
money.
the
employer
is
losing
something,
but
in
comparison
to
the
other
property
interests
that
the
court
has
considered
it's
not
that
much.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
but
we
don't
think
that
adds
anything
more
to
the
analysis.
i
mean,
that's
the
same
right
that
he
has
not
to
pay
someone
he
doesn't
want
to
pay.
if
he
had
lost
the
arbitration
proceeding,
he
wouldn't
have
that
right.
so
the
fact
that
he
won
it
doesn't
give
him
anything
more.
it
just
means
that
he
has
that
right.
in
contrast
to
what
we
see
as
this
property
interests,
although
a
less
substantial
property
interest,
of
the
employee,
there
is
the
quite
weighty
interest
of
the
government
here.
section
405
is
based
on
what
the
court
has
characterized
as
the
government's
paramount
interest
in
highway
safety.
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
congress
had
before
it
evidence
of
massive
noncompliance
by
the
motor
transportation
industry
with
the
federal
safety
standards
that
apply
in
that
area,
and
congress
concluded
that
if
employees
were
protected
from
retaliatory
discharges
and
thus
able
to
act
to
enforce
safety
standards
that
compliance
with
safety
standards
would
be
encouraged.
and
therefore,
it
adopted
section
405
to
provide
employees
with
this
protection.
and
it
seems
clear
that
the
interim
reinstatement
protection
that's
at
issue
here
is
essential
to
congress'
employee
protection
plan.
an
employee
has
to
pay
his
monthly
bills
for
food
and
shelter
on
an
ongoing
basis
as
they
come
due,
and
so
an
award
of
back
pay
several
years
down
the
line
does
not
give
the
employee
the
protection
that
he
really
needs
if
the
protection
that
congress
designed
is
to
become
real.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
secretary
is
cognizant
of
the
need
for
expedition.
and
as
we
discuss
in
our
reply
brief,
he
is
endeavoring
to
speed
up
the
investigation
period
and
they
have
gotten
somewhat
speedier.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
statute
doesn't
provide
a
deadline
for
the
alj,
although
the
regulations
that
the
secretary--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor,
the
secretary
hasn't
interpreted
the
statute
that
way.
but
he
has
issued
regulations
that
do
set
time
limits
on
the
alj's
action.
and
again,
we
wouldn't
read...
even
if
the
120
day
period
had
a
different
interpretation,
we
wouldn't
read
it
as
cutting
off
the
secretary's
jurisdiction.
but
again,
the
secretary
is
cognizant
of
his
obligations
to
move
speedily,
but
especially
in
an
investigatory
period
he
has
to
balance
the
employer's
rights
and
the
employee's
rights
in
wanting
to
reach
a
fair
determination,
and
also
in
the
subsequent
period
the
employer
may
need
extra
time
to
get
his
case
together
and
in
that
case
it
wouldn't
be
fair
to
press
ahead
if
the
employer
is
the
one
that's
asking
for
the
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
fair
reading
of
the
statute,
i
think,
is
that
congress
intended
the
secretary
to
conduct
an
investigation
and
for
reinstatement
to
happen
on
the
conclusion
of
that
investigation,
and
for
adversary
proceedings
to
follow.
now,
the
secretary's
investigation
has
to
be
comprehensive
and
is
as
fast
as
possible.
and
we
think
there
is
no
way
for
the
secretary
to
conduct
a
less
comprehensive
investigation
and
still
meet
his
obligations
under
the
statute.
so
the
effect
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
reinstatement--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't
suggest
that,
and
as
the
times
that
we've
submitted
in
our
reply
brief
show,
that's
not
what
the
secretary
actually
does
in
every
case.
in
this
case
it
happened
to
take
a
long
time.
there
was
quite
a
controversy
about
the
facts,
and
the
complainant
alleged
that
he
had
engaged
in
a
variety
of
safety-related
activities
that
all
had
to
be
checked
out.
in
addition,
these
people
are
truck
drivers
and
so
sometimes
it's
hard
to
locate
the
relevant
people
in
order
to
talk
to
them
because
they
are
on
the
road.
but
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
case
is
typical,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
court
should
base
its
due
process
decision
on
this,
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
the
court
said
a
number
of
times
that
due
process
decisions
are
based
on
the
generality
of
cases
and,
although
the
time
happened
to
be
long
in
this
case,
we
think
it
generally
isn't.
and
we
think
that
the
time
that
the
secretary
takes
for
an
investigation
is
what
he
think
is
required
to
meet
his
statutory
obligations,
and
if
a
hearing
is
required
before
reinstatement
that
that
is
just
going
to
be
an
additional
time
piled
on
top
of
the
investigation,
and
so
it
will
delay
reinstatement.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
that
might
be
true
in
this
particular
case,
but
it
may
not
be
true
in
many,
many
cases.
and
especially
where--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
that's
what
the
court's
cases
have
required.
in
loudermill,
for
example,
the
court
indicated
that
a
nine
month
delay
before
temporary...
between
the
temporary
action
and
final
action
was
not
anything
that
approached
a
due
process
violation.
and
the
time
period
was
even
longer
in
mathews
against
eldridge.
so--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
that's--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
the
secretary--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
that's
certainly
true
from
the
employer's
point
of
view,
and
in
addition
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--there
are
two
different
time
limits
at
issue
here.
there
is
the
time
limit
for
the
time
of
the
investigation
leading
up
to
the
reinstatement
and
then
there
is
the
time
between
the
temporary
reinstatement
and
an
evidentiary
hearing.
and
justice
scalia
was
referring
to
that
first
time
limit,
which
doesn't...
in
which
the
secretary
endeavors
to
act
speedily,
because
the
rights
of
the
employee
are
at
issue.
but
the
length
of
that
investigation,
actually
the
more
thorough
it
is
the
better
it
is
for
the
employer.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
except
that
i
don't
think
that
the
length
of
time
has
anything
to
do
with
the
back
pay
question.
if
it's
found
that
the
employer
has
violated
the
statute,
then
he
is
obligated
to
pay
back
pay,
however
long
the
period
is.
that's
a
separate
question
from
the
question
of
temporary--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
although
the
preliminary...
well,
the
back
pay
obligation
runs
from
the
date
of
the
discharge.
so
it's
all...
i
mean,
the
whole
period
is
relevant,
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
i
don't
think
that
that
question
has
anything
to
do
with
the
due
process
issue
here.
the
court
has
recognized
in
a
line
of
cases
starting
with
mathews
against
eldridge
through
barry/barchi,
barry
against
barchi,
mackey,
and
loudermill,
that
the
kind
of
procedure
that
the
secretary
uses
here
is
precisely
what
the
due
process
clause
requires,
that
before
a
temporary
action
is
taken
there
must
be
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
some
kind
of
a
reasonable
check
on
the
accuracy
of
the
decisionmaking
process,
exactly
what
the
secretary
does
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
a
prompt
post-action
hearing.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
statute
requires
that
the
post-reinstatement
hearing
be
expeditiously
conducted,
and
the
secretary
has
issued
regulations
that
do
set
down
time
limits
on
when
that
will
happen...
for
every
process,
every
stage
along
the
process
culminating
in
the
secretary's
final
decision,
which
amount
to
seven
months,
which
is
less
than
the
period
that
the
court
has
recognized
in
both
mathews
and
loudermill
as
appropriate.
in
loudermill,
the
court
said
that
there
was
no
problem
with
nine
months.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
time
limits
are
directory,
and
if
in
a
particular
case,
as
in
loudermill,
the
court
indicated
that
there
was
a
two-step
inquiry.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
scheme
that
the
government
follows
provides
for
an
expeditious
hearing.
the
second
inquiry
is
whether
in
the
particular
case
those
limits
were
met
and,
if
they
were
not
met,
were
they
exceeded
by
such
a
degree
that
it
amounted
to
a
due
process
violation.
so
we
think
that's
the
inquiry
here.
the
secretary
set
up
a
scheme
that
complies
with
what
the
due
process
clause
requires.
in
a
particular
case
it
might
be
that
those
time
limits
might
be
exceeded
and
it
might
be
open
for
an
employer
to
argue
that
he's
been
subject
to
a
due
process
violation.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
scheme
is
invalid,
and
the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
scheme
should
be
upheld
and
we
submit
that
it
should.
i'd
like
to
briefly
discuss
another
way
of
looking
at
the
case
that
we
think
confirms
the
constitutionality
of
what
congress
has
done
here.
the
interim
reinstatement
remedy
could
also
be
viewed
as
at
accommodation
of
conflicting
interests,
similar
to
preliminary
relief
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
here
the
conflicting
interests
are
the
interests
of
the
employer
and
the
interests
of
the
employee.
on
the
one
hand,
the
employee
has
an
interest
guaranteed
by
section
405
in
not
being
discharged
in
retaliation
for
safety
activities.
on
the
other
hand,
the
employer
has
an
interest
in
protecting
his
authority
to
discharge
employees.
and
in
drafting
section
405,
congress
had
to
decide
where
the
interim
burden
was
going
to
fall
in
a
dispute
over
the
discharge.
and
as
i've
discussed,
the
absence
of
interim
relief
would
threaten
the
employee
with
the
prolonged
loss
of
his
means
of
livelihood
and
adversely
affect
employees'
willingness
to
engage
in
conduct
protected
under
the
statute.
on
the
other
hand,
permitting
interim
reinstatement
does
not
unduly
burden
employers
because
they
suffer
no
economic
loss
in
the
sense
that
they
get
a
day's
work
for
a
day's
pay.
so
in
these
circumstances,
congress
made
a
reasonable
determination
that
it
was
the
employer
that
could
best
bear
the
burden
of
the
dispute
over
the
discharge
where
there
has
been
a
showing,
based
on
an
investigation,
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
discharge
was
unlawful.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it's
a
reasonable...
it
was
a
finding
of
reasonable
cause,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
but
before
it
went
into
effect.
the
employer
here
was
never
required
to
reinstate
the
employee.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
it's
a
51
percent
determination,
a
more
probably
than
not
determination.
we
think
it's
a
determination
akin
to
probable
cause
or
maybe
a
little
bit
more
than
probable
cause.
in
fact,
"reasonable
cause"
is
exactly
the
term
that
the
court
used
in
its
decision
in
loudermill
as
the
finding
that
would
provide
the
preliminary
check
upon
the
accuracy
of
the
government
determination.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
as
i
said,
we
think
that
it's
a
finding
that
the
complaint
has
merit,
not
necessarily
a
finding
of
51
percent.
but
it's
a
finding...
in
defining
"probable
cause",
the
court
has
characterized
it
as
a
probability
or
a
substantial
chance,
and
we
think
that
that's
the
same
kind
of
finding
that
the
secretary
is
making
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
that
the
court
indicated
in
illinois
against
cape
that
probable
cause
is
not
a
51
percent
determination;
it's
something
less
than
51
percent.
and
that's
the
same
kind
of
determination
that
the
secretary
makes
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
in
every
case,
again,
there
isn't
an
eleven
month
investigation.
and
it
may
be
that
the
evidence
before
the
secretary
when
he
made
this
determination
allowed
him
to
make
a
much
more
substantial
finding.
but
all
that
congress
required
was
a
reasonable
cause
finding,
and
again
that's
all
the
court
has
required
in
its
decisions.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
your
honor,
the
secretary
in
subsequent
investigations
has
moved
more
expeditiously
and
is
moving
more
expeditiously
now.
but
he
recognizes
his
obligations
to
both
employers
and
employees
to
give
people
a
fair
hearing
about
these
complaints.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
a
few
points,
your
honor.
i
first
want
to
address
the
question
of
the
information
that's
available
to
the
employer
during
the
investigatory
process.
although
the
statute
doesn't
require
it,
there
is
nothing...
first
of
all,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
happened
here.
but
the
department
informs
us
that
its
practice
is
to
provide
employers
with
the
substance
of
the
information
that
the
secretary
is
relying
on
for
his
reasonable
cause
finding,
so
that
they
have
a
chance
to
respond
to
it.
we
don't
take
a
position
that...
so
we
agree
that
that
information
can
be
provided.
with
respect
to
the
names
of
the
witnesses,
however,
we
think
it's
important
that
those
names
not
be
disclosed
until
the
time
of
testimony,
because
there
is
a
genuine
danger
that
those
people
will
be
intimidated
and
that
they
will
not
testify,
and
we
think
that
they
should
be
protected
until...
under
the
rationale
that
the
court
has
used
in
its
foia
cases,
until
the
time
comes
when
they
take
the
stand,
so
that
the
employer
won't
have
an
opportunity
to
tamper
with
the
proceeding.
now,
about
the
question
of
when
the
hearing
is
required,
roadway
relies
on
some
other
statutes
that
don't
require...
that
don't
have
preliminary
remedies,
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
prior
hearing
here.
but
the
congress
has
made
a
different
choice.
congress
has
created
a
preliminary
remedy
here,
and
that's
the
reason
why
there's
no...
that's
the
reason
why
this
case
is
different
and
the
reason
why
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
like
loudermill
are
applicable
here,
because
congress
has
made
a
decision
that
a
hearing
should
be
held
afterward,
and
the
due
process
clause
does
not
invalidate
that
decision
because
the
employer
is
provided
with
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
respond,
a
reasonable
cause
finding,
and
the
subsequent
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
congress
devised
the
procedure
whereby
the
hearing
is
held
after
the
reinstatement
of
the
employees.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
didn't
specified
an
evidentiary
hearing
at
that
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
no,
we
interpret
the
statute
as
being
quite
clear
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
investigatory
process
that's
when
reinstatement
occurs,
and
that
the
adversary
process
starts
afterwards,
while
the
employee
is
back
at
work.
and
we
think
that
that's
the
determination
that
congress
made.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
think
that
congress'
determination
was
that
the
hearing
should
be
post-reinstatement,
not
pre-reinstatement.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
we
think
that
it
falls
within
the
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review
exception
we
discuss
in
our
reply
brief.
roadway
is
a
big
trucking
company.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
just
with
respect
to
appellee's
investigatory-adjudicatory
argument,
we
think
the
court's
decision
in
withrow
against
larkin
makes
clear
that
there's
no
due
process
problem
in
this
case.
that's
all
i
have,
your
honors.
