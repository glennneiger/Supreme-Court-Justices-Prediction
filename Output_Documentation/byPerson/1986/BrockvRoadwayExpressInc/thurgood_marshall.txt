mr.
towers,
what
other
agency
does
what
you
want
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
uh-hmm.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
i
understand
you
want
a
preliminary
hearing
before
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
two
hearings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
two
hearings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
normal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
available
under
another
act.
you've
got...
is
that
the
only
one
you
know
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
seems
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
investigatory
process,
and
i
always
understood
that
you
weren't
entitled
to
get
in
at
that
stage,
the
investigatory
stage.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
entitled
to
get
in
at
the
investigatory
stage
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
ends
up
with
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
those
cases
are
analogous.
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
i
believe
is
one
of
the
cases--
--you
mean
when
the
prosecuting
authority
is
assembling
its
evidence
you're
entitled
to
be
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
preliminary
is
merely
to
find
if
there
is
probable
cause.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
you're
entitled
to
be
there
at
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
it
starts,
you're
entitled
to
be
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
last
case
brock
versus
roadway
express
incorporated
is
in
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia.
which
court
held
unconstitutional
section
405
of
the
surface
transportation
assistance
act.
we
hold
today
that
the
act
does
not
deprive
the
employer
of
due
process
by
failing
to
require
the
full
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
temporary
reinstatement
is
ordered.
so
long
as
the
employee
is
given
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
secretary's
evidence
and
the
prompt
postreinstatement
hearing
is
available.
we
therefore
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part.
justice
blackmun,
justice
powell
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined
this
opinion;
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
join;
justice
steven
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
in
part.
