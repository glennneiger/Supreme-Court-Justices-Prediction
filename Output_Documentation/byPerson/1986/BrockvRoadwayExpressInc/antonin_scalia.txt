scalia
still,
it
might
be
considered
a
quid
pro
quo
for
the
employers
who
are
subject
to
this
act
that
what's
taken
away
is
that
they
have
to
reinstate;
on
the
other
hand,
what
they
get
is
a
pretty
good
estimation
of
whether
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
back
pay
ultimately.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
secretary
finds
against
them
on
that
initial
determination
i
expect
a
lot
of
employers
would
simply
throw
in
the
towel
and
reinstate
and
not
be
subject
to
any
more
back
pay
liability.
and
by
delaying
that
for
a
long
time,
the
secretary
has
taken
away
a
lot
of
the
quid
pro
quo.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
it's
a
deprivation
of
property
if
somebody
requires
me
to
hire
somebody
that
i
don't
want
to
hire?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
just
said
that
there
would
have
been
a
clear...
the
mere
payment
of
the
money
would
have
been
a
property
interest
if
all
the
secretary
did
was
require
the
back
pay,
without
requiring
the
man
to
be
re-employed.
but
you
seem
to
suggest
that,
since
you're
not
just
requiring
the
money
to
be
paid,
you're
also
requiring
the
individual
to
work,
that
somehow
it's
different,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
requiring
you
to
hire
somebody
you
don't
want
to
hire
and
to
pay
them
when
you
don't
want
to
pay
them
is
clearly
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
he's
not
losing
much
because
he's
getting
the
labor
of
a
person
whose
labor
he
doesn't
want,
and
you
don't
think
that's
very
much?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
following
this
discussion.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
longer
it
goes
on,
as
far
as
the
employer's
due
process
complaint
is
concerned,
the
longer
it
goes
on
the
better
off
he
is,
isn't
that
right?
the
employer
doesn't
have
any
incentive
to
get
it
decided
quickly.
the
more
quickly
it's
decided,
the
sooner
he
has
to
re-employ
this
fellow.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
may
be
a
terrible
way
to
administer
the
act,
but
as
far
as
the
employer
is
concerned
the
longer
these
things
take
the
better,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
20
months
is
great
for
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
he
doesn't
have
to
rehire
this
fellow.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
back
pay
is
going
to
depend
on
how
long
it
takes
to
complete
the
final
hearing,
not
this
preliminary
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that's
right.
he'll
be
working
for
some
of
it
if
he's
put
in
earlier.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
"reasonable
cause
to
believe"
mean?
is
the
secretary
making
the
determination
at
this
preliminary
stage
that,
on
the
basis
of
a
rough
ride
through
the
material,
he
thinks
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
this
person
had
been
discharged
for
this
reason?
or
is
it
just
that
there
is
some...
that
there
is
what,
a
real
possibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
we
mean
by
it
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
probability
is
51
percent,
isn't
it,
or
a
substantial
chance.
justice
antonin
scalia
after
doing
eleven
months
worth
of
work,
why
wouldn't
it
be
more
sensible
in
deciding
where
the
burden
ought
to
fall
to
have
it
fall
on
the
person
who's
more
likely
to
be
the
one
at
fault?
i
mean,
why
shouldn't
it
be
a
probability
call?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
it
all
the
more
amazing
why
it
would
take
eleven
months
then,
if
all
he
looks
to
see
is
whether
there
is
any
merit.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
going
to
be
a
substantial
risk
of
error
anyway.
we
have
just
heard
that
all
the
secretary's
trying
to
find
is
a
substantial
possibility,
which
is
maybe,
i
don't
know,
33
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
a
two
to
one
chance
that
it's
wrong
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know.
it's
a
strange
argument.
you're
saying
that
there
is
a
substantial
probability.
you
want
to
have
a
very
careful
hearing
to
be
sure
that
the
chances
are
two
to
one
that
you're
right,
but
you're
nevertheless
going
to
have
to
pay
the
employee
in
the
interim,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
the
secretary
to
be
very
careful
in
determining
that
you
probably
were
right
to
fire
this
fellow,
but
you
nonetheless
should
keep
him
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
if
less...
if
you
acknowledge
that
less
than
a
probability
is
an
adequate
standard,
it
seems
very
strange
to
say
that
in
order
to
meet
that
standard
we
need
the
full
panoply
of
adversary
proceedings,
cross-examination
and
everything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
the
argument
that
judges
usually
here
is
that
it's
impossible
to
prove
a
negative.
and
you're
complaining
about
the
inability
to
introduce
evidence
on
the
negative.
it
seems
to
me
once
you
have
your
notice,
all
the
affirmative...
all
the
evidence
on
the
affirmative
that
you
have
you
know
to
introduce.
i
assume
when
you
get
the
notice
you
will
come
forward
with
the
reasons
why
you
did
fire
the
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
rest
is
an
attempt
to
prove
the
negative,
which
is
very
difficult
to
do
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
shorter
it
takes,
the
less
likely
you
are
to
get
here
in
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
we
find
out
more
about
the
content
of
this
hearing
that
you're
asking
for?
now,
you
said
the
secretary
doesn't
have
to
put
on
anything;
he
can
just
take
his
best
shot.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
could
he
withhold
any
of
the
witnesses
that
he
has?
you'd
certainly
want
to
cross-examine
all
the
witnesses
that
he's
relying
on
at
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
what
would
you
put
on?
you'd
put
on
as
much
as
you
want?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
rebuttal
would
include
anything.
i
mean,
anything
that
would
show
that
you
were
not
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
don't
see
how
it
differs
from
the
final
hearing
and
what
is
saved
by
having
this
expedited
process
if
we
have
this.
wherein
does
it
differ
from
the
full
dress
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
an
alj
does
that
in
the
final
hearing,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
restrain
yourself
during
that
hearing
and
not
put
on
all
the
evidence
that
you
possibly
have?
is
that
likely?
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
put
on
every
bit
of
evidence
you
possibly
could,
wouldn't
you,
as
much
as
the
alj
would
possibly
let
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
assert
that
that's
applicable
here,
554?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
by
analogy.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't
hang
too
much
on
congress.
congress
just
said
a
hearing.
congress
didn't
say
what
kind
of
a
hearing,
did
it?
congress
no
more
said
your
kind
than
it
said
the
kind
that
your
opponent
proposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
specify
it,
but
it
didn't
say
not,
either.
i
mean,
really
you
can't
say
that
congress...
this
is
much
more
the
secretary's
decision
than
congress'
decision,
isn't
it,
that
we're
disputing
here?
