mr.
towers,
you
say
you
do
not
want
a
full
evidentiary
hearing,
but
would
you
like...
do
you
think
you're
entitled
to
the
right
to
cross-examine
the
secretary's
witnesses?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
prior
to
the
final?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
would
be
the
difference
between
that
and
the
final
hearing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you'd
want
him
to
put
on
all
the
witnesses
that
he
has.
perhaps
if
you
were
supplied
with
the
statements
of
witnesses
that
were
presented
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
you
would
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
those.
but
you
didn't
have
even
the
names
of
the
witnesses
relied
on,
did
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
had
no
idea
what
the
secretary
of
labor
had?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
a
question
of
the
status
of
this
case
now.
is
it
on
appeal
before
ca
11?
