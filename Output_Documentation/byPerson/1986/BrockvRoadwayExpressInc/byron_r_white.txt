justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
order
to
reinstate
would
require
back
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
be
so,
as
justice
stevens
says,
if
you
really
lived
up
to
the
60
day
requirement,
why,
you
could
order
reinstatement
and
then
maybe
take
some
time
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
if
you're
going
to
skip
that
time
limit,
you
better
hold
your
evidentiary
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
--especially
if
he
thinks
he's
a
dangerous
employee.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
isn't
a
good
truck
driver.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
august.
justice
byron
r.
white
august.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
subject
to
some
judicial
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
relief
are
you
going
to
get
if
you
win
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
short
answer
is
that
if
you
win
this
case
you're
not
going
to
get
anything
except
some
protection
in
the
event
you
allegedly
violate
the
act
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
pretty
speculative,
whether
you're
going
to
commit
another
violation
of
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
big
likelihood
that
he'll
take
eleven
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
of
course,
you
don't...
you
say
whether
it's
60
days
or
however
long,
that
there
should
be
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
an
order
to
reinstate.
justice
byron
r.
white
before
they
have
a
chance
to
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
secretary...
the
statute
would
not
prevent
the
secretary
from
providing
hearings
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
statute
as
applied
in
this
case
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
he
could
under
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
the
statute,
the
secretary
is
going
to
be
giving
hearings
before
reinstatement?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
answer
is
yes
to
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
is
this
case
not
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
