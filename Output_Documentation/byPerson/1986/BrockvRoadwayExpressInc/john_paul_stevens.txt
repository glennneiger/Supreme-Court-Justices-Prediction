justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
pincus,
because
i'll
tell
you,
i'm
concerned
about
the
timeliness
of
some
of
these
things
that
happen
in
this
case.
do
you
think
the
statute
requires
that
the
reasonable
cause
investigation
be
completed
within
60
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the...
where
did
the
secretary
get
the
authority
to
just
in
effect
ignore
that
60
day
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
this
a
complex
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
legislative
history
that
supported
the
secretary's
argument
there
that
that
was
directed
to
a
different
purpose.
but
there's
no
such
history
in
this
case,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
whenever
the
secretary
does
complete
it...
here
i
guess
it
was
about
eleven
months...
then
the
back
pay
obligation
attaches,
too,
doesn't
it,
if
he
finds
reasonable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
a
little
more
serious
if
an
employer
has
to
wait
a
year
or
so
and
then
finds
he's
got
a
year's
back
pay
to
pay,
which
i
suppose
he'll
never
see
again
once
he
pays
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
it
at
the
time
of
the
reasonable
cause
determination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
the
employer
also
lose
a
contract
right
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
have
an
arbitration
award
enforced?
here
there
was
arbitration,
as
i
understand
it,
and
apparently
the
alj
had
a
different
view
of
the
matter.
but
under
the
contract
he
had
a
right,
a
contract
right,
to
terminate
this
employee,
didn't
he,
apart
from
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
that's
part
of
the
60
day
requirement,
too.
eleven
months
he
had
to
go
without
food
and
drink,
for
eleven
months,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can't
resist
also
asking
you
about
your
interpretation
of
the
sentence:
"upon
the
conclusion
of
such
hearing,
the
secretary
shall
issue
a
final
order
within
120
days.
"
and
you
read
that,
as
i
understand
it,
to
say
after,
120
days
after
the
alj
issues
his
order,
but
the
alj
can
take
forever
to
issue
his
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
you
read
it
into
this
120
day...
unless
you
read
the
plain
language
of
the
sentence
i
just
read
to
you,
because
that
certainly
sounds
as
though
the
secretary
has
to
get
through
with
the
matter
within
120
days.
but
you
don't
read
it
that
way,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
process
that
he
actually
follows
is
any
more
expeditious
than
convening
a
very,
on
short
notice,
an
adversary
hearing
like
you
might
have
on
a
motion
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
a
court?
i
don't
understand
why
you
have
to
proceed
without
having
an
adversary
proceeding
promptly
held.
what
is
the
need
for
this
particular
procedure?
can
you
tell
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
going
to
have
a
hard
time
convincing
me
that
they
spend
eleven
months
working
on
this
case
and
nothing
else.
i
imagine
they
have
a
whole
lot
of
cases
and
this
case
took
its
turn
with
a
very
busy
administrative
office.
or
do
you
suggest
that
this
amount
of
time
is
necessary
on
every
case
that
comes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
follows.
i'm
not
sure
if
you
didn't
subpoena
everybody
in
at
once,
as
you
do
in
emergency
proceedings
often,
you
couldn't
get
to
the
truth
a
lot
faster
than
by
separately
investigating
without
everybody
else
knowing
what's
going
on.
but
i
suppose
there's
some
merit.
i
would
think
in
eleven
months
you
could
have
had
your
evidentiary
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
certainly
that's
not
true.
between
the
date
of
the
temporary
order
saying,
you
reinstate
now,
and
the
conclusion
of
the
proceedings,
when
he
must
be
employed
during
that
interval,
and
he
doesn't
want
this
man
working
there
and
he
may
eventually
win--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
the
man
doesn't
work
for
eleven
months
and
yet
gets
eleven
months
pay,
that's
worse
than
not
working
30
days
and
getting
30
days
back
pay,
because
part
of
your
argument
was
that
part
of
the
quid
pro
quo
is
he
gets
services
for
the
back
pay,
but
he
doesn't
get
any
services
for
the
back
pay
during
the
period
between
the
discharge
and
the
temporary
order.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
towers,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions.
first,
what
about
your
opponent's
argument
that
if
you
try
to
hold
a
hearing
in
this
short
period
of
time,
assume
the
fact
that
everybody
could
meet
the
deadlines
in
the
statute,
the
60
days
and
so
forth,
in
the
trucking
industry
particularly
a
driver
is
all
over
the
country
and
it's
hard
to
get
the
witnesses
together
on
short
notice
in
a
particular
place.
is
that...
is
it
feasible
to
think
in
terms
of
an
actual
adversary
hearing
on
that
short
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
people
are
apt
to
be
all
over
the
country,
whereas
the
miners
i
suppose
all
work
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--my
second
question
is
at
the
time
you
get
the
finding
of
reasonable
cause,
does
the
secretary
also
give
you
some
kind
of
a
summary
of
findings,
identifying
the
people
on
whom
he
relied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
still
get
nothing
more
than
the
basic
notice
in
the
first
instance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
i
should
ask
you
opponent,
but
what
is
the
reason
for
not
disclosing
the
names
of
witnesses
if
they're
going
to
have
to
testify
anyway?
i
mean,
what
is
he
protecting
them
against
if
you're
going
to
have
to
rely
on
them
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
which
event
they'd
have
the
same
statutory
protection
that
this
man
has.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
