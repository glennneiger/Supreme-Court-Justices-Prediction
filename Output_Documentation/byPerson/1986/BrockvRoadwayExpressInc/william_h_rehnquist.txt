mr.
pincus,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
may
have
gotten
the
authority
from
the
same
place
that
the
last
case
we
have
from
the
secretary
of
labor
got
the
authority,
which
as
i
recall
was
very
belated
processing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
pincus,
do
i
understand
the
government
concedes
that
there
is
a
property
interest
on
the
part
of
the
employer
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
precisely
is
the
property
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
there
some
case
from
this
court
that
you
regard
as
peculiarly
apposite
in
making
that
concession?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
the
basis
of
the
preliminary
order,
is
based
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
employer
in
this
case
sought
and
obtained
the
injunction
after
the
preliminary
order
had
been
issued,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
only
reason
he
wasn't
required
was
because
the
district
court
enjoined
the
application
of
the
preliminary
order?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
towers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
mere
fact
that
the
employer
strongly
and
quite
reasonably
objects
to
being
made
to
do
this,
does
that
convert
the
situation
into
a
property
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
towers.
mr.
pincus,
do
you
have
something
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
the
case
is
submitted.
