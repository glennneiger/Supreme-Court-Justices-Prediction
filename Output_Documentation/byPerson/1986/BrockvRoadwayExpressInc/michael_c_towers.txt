mr.
michael
c.
towers
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
section
405
of
the
surface
transportation
assistance
act
is
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
that
it
mandates
preliminary
reinstatement
of
a
terminated
employee
without
first
affording
the
employer
a
rudimentary
evidentiary
hearing
opportunity
to
defend
itself.
without
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing,
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
error,
and
an
erroneous
reinstatement
is
not
inconsequential.
it
may
be
in
duration
anywhere
from--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--i'm
not
sure--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--i'm
not
sure
what
the
technical
definition
of
"reasonable
cause"
is.
it
is
a
lower
standard
of
proof
than
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
i
would
accept
that.
but
what
the
statute
has
done
for
the
preliminary
reinstatement
order
is
set
a
standard.
the
standard
doesn't
change
the
constitutional
mandate
that
we
be
given
an
opportunity
to
test
whether
that
standard
has
been
met,
and
that's
the
thrust
of
our--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--i
don't
follow
the
last
part,
your
honor.
but
yes,
we
do
want
to--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--we
want--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--i
want
to
make
clear,
we're
not
asking
for
the
full
panoply
of
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
we
are
asking
for
a
rudimentary
evidentiary
hearing
to
give
us
an
opportunity
to
know
the
evidence
being
considered
by
the
fact
finder,
the
secretary
of
labor's
representative,
so
that
we
can
present
our
defense
to
that
and
establish
that
there
is
not
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
act
has
been
violated.
under
the
current
practice,
we
are
advised
of
a
charge
and
we're
given
an
opportunity
to
submit
a
position
statement.
we
are
not
given
an
opportunity
to
mold
our
defense
or
shape
our
defense
to
the
evidence
being
considered
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
and
in
a
case
under
section
405,
that
is
a
particularly
important
point.
405(a)
prohibits
an
employer
discharging
an
employee
because
he
has
engaged
in
safety-related
activity
or
made
safety
complaints.
405(b)
prohibits
the
employer
from
discharging
an
employee
because
he
refuses
to
work
in
an
unsafe
working
condition,
a
condition
that
he
believes
to
be
unsafe
and
that
a
reasonable
man
would
believe
to
be
unsafe.
those
are
so
fundamentally
subjective
questions
of
motive,
dual
motive...
would
this
individual
have
been
terminated
but
for
his
safety-related
activity,
was
he
a
reasonable
man
under
the
circumstances,
what
was
the
intent
of
the
employee?
all
of
those
are
such
subjective
factors
that
the
employer
has
no
opportunity
to
rebut,
because
we
don't
know
what
the
secretary
of
labor
has
on
which
he's
relying
in
his
belief
that
we
violated
the
law.
we're
told
that
x
employee
says
we
fired
him
because
of
his
safety-related
activities,
period.
the
guidelines
used
by
the
secretary
of
labor's
field
operators
simply
call
on
the
investigator...
this
is
at
page
roman
numeral
v-v
of
the
directory
of
field
operations
that
was
lodged
with
the
court
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
investigator
is
simply
required
to
notify
the
respondents
of
the
substance
of
the
complaint,
and
that
notification
is
set
forth
in
an
appendix
to
these
guidelines,
a
form
letter.
and
the
form
letter
merely
says:
"we
hereby
serve
you
notice
that
a
complaint
has
been
filed
with
this
office
by
complainant
alleging
a
violation
of
section
405
of
the
surface
transportation
assistance
act.
"
"we
would
appreciate
receiving
from
you
promptly
a
full
and
complete
written
account
of
the
facts
and
a
statement
of
your
position
with
respect
to
the
allegation
that
you
have
discriminated
against
the
complainant
in
violation
of
the
act.
"
the
secretary
of
labor
has
just
issued
proposed
regulations,
just
last
november
21st,
that
say
the
same
thing
essentially:
"upon
receipt
of
a
complaint,
the
assistant
secretary.
"
--"a
copy
of"...
i'm
sorry.
"upon
receipt
of
a
valid
complaint,
osha
shall
notify
the
named
person.
"
--which
is
defined
as
the
charged
employer...
"shall
notify
the
named
person
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
his
or
her
rights
under.
"
other
sections
of
the
regs,
and
those
rights
are
to
submit
a
position
statement
within
20
days
and
any
witnesses
we
want
to
bring
forward.
how
do
we
know
what
witnesses
to
bring
forward?
we
don't
know
what
motive
we're
being
charged
with,
what
evidence
they're
relying
on
to
say
we've
had
bad
motives.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
exactly,
and--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--it
is
difficult
to
do.
it
is
an
attempt
to
prove
that
we
didn't
have
bad
motive.
but
we
can't
offer
evidence
to
either
rebut
the
credibility
of
the
individuals
who
claim
they
have
concrete
evidence
of
our
retaliatory
motive.
nor
can
we
bring
forward
evidence
to
establish
that
we
did
not
have
retaliatory
motive
and
that
these
people
are
liars,
are
vindictive,
or
that
they
weren't
in
town
when
they
allegedly
heard
these
things,
whatever
it
may
be.
we
don't
know
what
they're
relying
on
on
the
motive
question.
of
course
we
know
why
we
fired
the
individual,
our
non-discriminatory
reason
that
we
articulate.
and
that's
the
best
we
can
do
in
a
position
statement.
in
the
situation
that
we
had
in
this
particular
case,
we
already
tested
this
case
before
a
grievance
resolution
panel
and
won.
we
knew
what
we
had
done.
we
knew
what
the
individual
said
he
had
done.
and
the
panel
went
with
us.
that's
what
we
submitted
in
our
position
statement.
here
are
the
statements
of
the
individuals.
we
didn't
know
until
we
got
to
the
final
hearing,
i
don't
remember
how
many
months
later
it
was...
eleven,
twelve
months,
because
there
was
an
interim
from
the
order
to
the
hearing...
that
three
of
the
teamster
witnesses
who
had
given
statements
to
the
arbitration
panel
concerning
relevant
facts
in
this
case
had
changed
their
testimony.
we
didn't
know
that
the
manager
who
fired
this
individual,
as
opposed
to
the
manager
who
reported
his
misconduct,
was
being
charged
with
retaliatory
motive
and
that
they
had
alleged
evidence
in
support
of
that.
we
couldn't
counter
that.
we
didn't
know
about
it.
we
didn't
know
that
the
secretary
of
labor
was
going
to
come
to
the
hearing
and
claim
that
the
teamsters
union
failed
to
adequately
represent
this
individual
in
the
arbitration
process.
we
were
apprised
of
none
of
that.
and
that's
why
we
contend
that
it's
constitutionally
infirm
to
conduct
an
investigation
with
such
subjective
facts
to
be
resolved
without
first
giving
us
an
opportunity
to
test
those
facts,
the
facts
on
which
the
decisionmaker
is
going
to
rely
in
depriving
us
of
our
property,
that
is
the
right
to
keep
this
person
out
of
the
workplace.
and
i'd
like
to
speak
a
moment
in
response
to
the
question,
your
honor,
of
what
is
the
property
interest.
the
property
interest
is
significantly
more
than
a
simple
right
to
terminate
an
individual,
either
the
contract
right
or
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
the
common
law
right
to
terminate
at
will
if
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
agreement,
or
perhaps
the
at-will
employment
agreement.
we
lose
the
bargained
for
arbitration
right.
now,
if
we
were
wrong,
as
the
solicitor
general
suggests,
and
the
man
should
have
been
put
back
to
work,
then
that
can
be
established
in
a
hearing,
a
preliminary
hearing
during
the
investigative
stage.
but
if
the
investigator
is
wrong,
we
have
lost
that
right.
most
importantly
is
the
coerced
employment
relationship,
particularly
in
the
trucking
industry.
we
are
being
asked
to
take
an
individual
in
whom
we
have
lost
all
confidence,
put
him
back
in
a
40
ton
piece
of
equipment
out
on
the
open
highway,
transporting
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
our
customers'
product
and
goods,
including
toxic
wastes,
chemicals,
nuclear
wastes,
explosives,
and
general
commodities,
put
him
on
the
highway
with
our
name
on
the
side
of
the
truck
as
our
representative.
that's
the
coerced
employment
relationship.
that's
the
nature
of
the
property
interest
that's
at
stake
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
it
converts
it
to
a
property
right.
it
is
a
property
right
and
it
is
a
property
right
that
can
be
abridged
by
congress
or
by
the
courts.
reinstatement
orders
issue
in
any
number
of
statutes:
title
7,
national
labor
relations
act,
any
number
of
statutes.
but
it
is
a
property
right
that
can
be
abridged
as
long
as
there
is...
the
standards
set
by
congress
have
been
met.
we
don't
have
a
chance
to
test
whether
those
standards
have
been
met.
so
yes,
it's
a
property
right
and
it's
a
property
right
wrongfully
taken
if
we
haven't
been
given
an
opportunity
to
establish
that
we
didn't
do
what
we
were
charged
with
doing
and
that
there's
not
reasonable
cause
to
believe
we've
done
what
we're
charged
with
doing.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
yes,
there
has
been
an
evidentiary
hearing.
there
was
a
full
hearing
after
the
injunction
entered.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
a
decision
of
the
secretary
of
labor
april
21st
this
year,
yes,
your
honor,
finding
that
the
individual
should
be
reinstated,
put
back
to
work
with
back
pay.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
c.
towers
august
21st
of
this
year.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
that
is
subject
to
judicial
review
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
in
fact
an
appeal
is
pending
in
the
eleventh
circuit
at
this
time.
we
are
not
asking
for
that
final
hearing
before
the
reinstatement
order
enters,
and
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
the
hearing.
we
are
suggesting
that
during
the
investigative
process
which
the
statute
calls
for
in
60
days,
during
that
60
day
period
or
however
long
the
secretary
decides
to
take
in
the
investigative
process,
we
should
be
given
a
rudimentary
evidentiary
hearing,
an
opportunity
to
test
the
evidence
on
which
the
secretary
is
relying
in
his
initial
belief
that
there
may
be
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
if
we
win
this
case...
well,
the
case
is
not
moot
because
this
is
the
type
of
case
that
is
subject
to
repetition
with
no
opportunity
for
quick
review.
we
couldn't
have
gotten
here
any
quicker
than
we
did.
we
have
a
direct
appeal
by
the
secretary
of
labor
in
this
particular
case,
although
there
has
been
a
final
order.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
that's
correct.
but
as
the
record
shows--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--we
aren't
going
to,
your
honor.
but
we
may
well
be
charged
with
committing
other
violations
of
the
law.
roadway
express
is,
if
not
the
largest,
one
of
the
three
largest
trucking
companies
in
the
united
states,
with
15,000
plus
employees,
and
so
there's
a
substantial
likelihood
that
there
will
be
other
charges
filed
some
time
in
the
future.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
some
have
taken
longer,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
we
want
the
an
evidentiary
hearing
during
the
investigative
period.
we
don't
want
an
eleven
month
interim
for
the
investigation
either,
because
back
pay
is
running.
we
have
hired
an
individual
to
replace
this
individual.
and
if
we
were
wrong,
we
have
to
put
this
individual
back
to
work
and
pay
him
back
pay
for
the
time
he
was
out.
of
course,
we've
already
paid
an
individual
to
perform
that
work
during
that
period.
we'd
like
a
60
day
investigative
period.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
secretary
of
labor--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--administers
any
number
of
whistle
blower
statutes.
the
other
whistle
blower
statutes
all
contemplate
an
investigation,
a
full
final
hearing,
and
a
decision
within
approximately
62
to
70
days.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
yes,
your
honor,
absolutely.
in
a
case
of
this
nature,
in
order
to
test
the
evidence,
the
reliability
of
the
evidence,
and
to
establish
whether
or
not
there
are
other
motives
on
the
part
of
this
individual,
whether
the
individual
is
mistaken,
the
context
within
which
he
heard
what
he
states
he
has
heard.
i
think
we
need,
definitely
need
that
opportunity.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
the
final
hearing
would
be...
first
of
all,
the
secretary
of
labor
would
be
putting
on
his
case
first,
and
he
would
be
able
to
put
on
everything
at
that
time
that
he
feels
supports
a
case
to
meet
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
test.
he
would
not
necessarily
have
to
do
that
in
a
preliminary
hearing.
he
could
put
on
his
best
shot.
it
could
be
an
abbreviated
hearing.
we'd
come
in
and
examine
those
witnesses,
put
on
our
best
shot,
and
let
the
fact
finder
make
his
determination:
is
there
reasonable
cause
or
not?
is
there
enough
reasonable
cause
to
deprive
us
of
our
property,
that
is
to
reinstate
this
individual?
mr.
michael
c.
towers
we
didn't
have
the
names
of
the
witnesses
under
the
asserted
confidentiality
rights
that
the
secretary
of
labor
asserts.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
not
really.
we
certainly
found
out
there
was
a
lot
that
he
was
asserting
when
we
got
to
the
final
hearing
that
we
didn't
know
about
during
the
investigation,
nor
did
we
know
about
during
the
arbitration.
it
was
a
new
game.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
the
secretary
of
labor's
final
decision
that
roadway
violated
the
act
in
relation
to
jerry
hufstetler
is
on
appeal.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
within
the
investigative
period.
the
statute
calls
for--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--even
if
it
goes
beyond
60
days.
right
now
the
average
is,
i
believe,
101,
102
days.
somewhere
during
the
investigative
period,
we
should
be
given
an
evidentiary
hearing
opportunity,
that's
our
contention.
that
would
not
be
the
final
hearing.
it
would
just
simply
be
a
check,
a
test
against
error.
and
it
would
not
adversely
impact
the
purpose
of
the
act.
that's
a
significant
point.
the
government's
interest
is
the
purpose
of
the
act,
that
is
to
encourage
whistle
blowing,
encourage
employees
to
refuse
to
work
in
unsafe
situations,
by
giving
them
an
element
of
comfort
that
if
they're
wrongfully
fired
they
can
get
back
to
work
quickly.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
it
would
be
up
to
the
secretary
as
the
proponent
to
put
on--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--i
would
want
to
cross-examine
all
of
the
witnesses
that
he
would
be
presenting
to
a
neutral
fact
finder.
i
don't
know...
it
wouldn't
be
the
investigator
himself
making
the
decision,
because
that
would
be
combining
the
prosecutor
with
the
decisionmaker.
i
assume
the
solicitor's
office
would
put
on
his
case
before
an
administrative
law
judge,
and
i
assume
it
would
be
their
strongest
witnesses
and
their
best
evidence.
if
they
wanted
to
put
on
a
full
hearing,
that
would
be
their
prerogative.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
we
would
put
on
rebuttal
to
what
they
had
put
on.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--the
full
dress
hearing
would
perhaps
include
witnesses
testifying
that
this
individual
is
a
credible
character,
that
individual
is
a
credible
character,
corroborating
evidence
and
so
forth.
since
it
would
be
a
minimal
hearing,
a
rudimentary
hearing,
the
hearing
officer
could
control
it,
move
the
witnesses
along,
move
the
attorneys
along:
you've
plowed
that
ground,
mr.
towers;
move
on
to
this,
that's--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--he
can.
but
certainly
a
final
hearing
could
be
much
more
complete,
with
corroborative
evidence,
evidence
going
to
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
that
have--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--i
would
be
putting
on
the
evidence
in
response
to
what--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--i
think
i
would
realistically
put
on
my
non-discriminatory
reason.
i
know
why
i
fired
the
man
and
i'd
do
everything
i
could
to
convince
the
alj
that
that
was
a
legitimate
termination.
then
i'd
have
to
respond
to
whatever
the
secretary
of
labor
is
putting
on
to
suggest
that
there
was
an
illegal
motive
or
a
dual
motive,
and
so
forth.
but
i
don't
know
what
that
would
be
until
i
got
to
the
hearing.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
gives
preliminary
hearings?
mr.
michael
c.
towers
the
secretary
of
labor
does
under
the
mine
safety
act,
in
exactly
the
same
situation.
under
southern
ohio
coal,
under
the
mine
safety
act
there
was
a
provision
in
the
act
that
if
an
individual
is
terminated,
files
a
complaint,
the
secretary
of
labor
can
order
immediate
reinstatement.
that
was
challenged
and
the
sixth
circuit
held
it
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
secretary
of
labor
devised
procedures
to
give
the
employer
a
rudimentary
evidentiary
hearing
before
that
reinstatement
order
takes
effect.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
i
want
a
preliminary
hearing
before
the
order--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
yes,
if
it
went
to--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--well,
it's
available
under
the
mine
safety
act
regulations.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
that's
the
only
one
i
know
of.
i
would
point
out
that
the
secretary
of
labor
in
all
of
the
other
statutes--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--we're
entitled
to
get
in
at
this
investigatory
stage
because
the
results
of
this
investigatory
stage
result
in
the
deprivation
of
property.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
now,
an
analagous
situation
would
be
you
would
be
entitled
to
get
in
at
the
investigatory
or
the
preliminary
stage
of
a
parole
revocation.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
when
the
prosecuting
authority
is
incarcerating
an
individual
because
he
believes
there
is
reasonable
cause
to
establish
that
the
individual
has
violated
his
parole,
that
individual
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
at
that
time
and
to
know
what
evidence
the
prosecuting
authority
is
relying
on
during
that
preliminary
interim,
before
there's
a
final
hearing.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
and
the
individual--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--in
a
parole
revocation
case,
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
we're
entitled
to
be
there
when
a
decision
is
being
made
as
to
whether
or
not
the
parolee
will
be
incarcerated
pending
a
full
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
violated
parole,
yes,
that
is
the
case.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
the
other
statutes
administered
by
the
secretary
of
labor
provide,
i
think
in
the
mine
safety,
a
ten
day
period
before
the
hearing
is
held.
we
could
accumulate
our
people
during
that
period
of
time.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
not
actually
all
over
the
country.
in
most
trucking
situations
now,
they
make
500
mile
runs
and
return.
there
are
some
long
haul
drivers
that
do
go
cross-country,
and
that
could
present
a
problem,
yes.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
there
could
be
a
problem
in
having
a
hearing
should
diminish
our
opportunity--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
that's
correct.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
face
of
having
won
this
in
an
arbitration,
a
finding
by
the
grievance
panel
that
this
man
committed
an
act
of
dishonesty
and
was
wrongfully
discharged,
we
got
a
finding
back
from
the
secretary
of
labor
that
said:
the
contention
of
the
employer
that
this
man
committed
an
act
of
dishonesty
is
conjecture.
that's
all
we
got.
now,
there
is
apa
discovery
available
during
the
30
days
that
passes
from
the
time
that
you
file
exceptions
to
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
labor
until
you
get
to
hearing.
so
you
can
get
30
days
of
expedited
discovery
before
the
final
hearing.
but
you
certainly
don't
have
any
of
that
information
available
to
you
during
the
investigatory
interim.
and
you
really
don't
even
get
the
witnesses
during
discovery,
because
the
secretary
of
labor
takes
the
position
he
does
not
have
to
disclose
the
names
of
those
individuals
under
the
informant's
privilege
until
they
have
testified
at
the
hearing,
the
final
full
hearing.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
they
invoke
the
informant's
privilege
and
say
that
these
people
might
be
retaliated
against
by
a
hostile
employer.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
before
they
have
a
chance
to
testify.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
they
would
have
the
same
statutory
protection.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
an
additional
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
connection
with
the
risk
of
error
is
the
dual
role
of
the
investigator.
he
functions
as
both
a
prosecutor
or
an
agent
of
the
prosecutor
and
as
a
decisionmaker
or
as
an
advisor
of
the
decisionmaker.
the
guidelines
used
by
the
secretary
of
labor's
investigator
are
the
same
guidelines
used
under
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
section
11(c),
which
is
substantially
the
same
as
405
except
in
the
remedy.
it
prohibits
the
same
activity.
405
was
passed
simply
to
extend
the
11(c)
protection
to
truck
drivers
who
were
covered
by
dot
and
exempt
from
osha.
however,
under
section
11(c)
once
the
investigator
concludes
that
there
is
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
act
has
been
violated,
that
is
11(c),
the
solicitor
goes
into
federal
district
court
and
files
suit
and
the
employer
gets
a
hearing.
using
that
same
procedure,
investigative
procedure
which
focuses
toward
prosecution,
the
investigator
conducts
an
investigation
in
which
he
attempts
to
resolve
credibility
issues,
resolve
fact
issues,
make
a
recommendation
to
his
regional
supervisor
as
to
whether
or
not
he
believes
the
act
has
been
violated.
so
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
investigator
functions
as
the
prosecutor.
and
i
would
point
out
by
analogy
that
this
is
prohibited
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
5
u.s.c.
554(d),
in
which
the
investigator
is
specifically
directed
not
to
participate
or
advise
in
the
decisionmaking
process.
this
goes
to
the
question
of
is
there
a
risk
of
error,
and--
mr.
michael
c.
towers
--i
don't
suggest
that
the
apa
is
applicable.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
i'm
offering
it
by
analogy,
and
the
analogy
is
offered
to
point
out
that
congress
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
error
in
combining
those
functions.
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
error
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
investigator
and
then
the
supervisor
and
the
regional
administrator
make
decision
which
is
contrary
to
a
prior
arbitration
award
which
is
based
on
an
adversarial
hearing.
that
certainly
raises
significant
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
error
in
the
investigator
and
regional
administrator's
decision
if
there
is
reasonable
cause
when
it
upsets
a
prior
arbitration
award.
this
statute
need
not,
however,
be
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
court.
the
statute
is
hearing
neutral
during
the
investigative
stage.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
which
provides
that
the
employer
may
not
have
a
hearing
during
the
investigative
stage
and
before
the
order
of
preliminary
reinstatement.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
he
must,
either.
the
court
below
recognized
this
and
said
that
the
statute
is
only
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
that
it
mandates
preliminary
reinstatement
without
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing.
this
court
in
califano
versus
yamasaki
recognized
that
a
hearing
neutral
statute
can
have
read
into
it
a
hearing
requirement.
it
had
a
similar
fact
situation
to
the
extent
that
the
issues
to
be
resolved
in
the
hearing
or
resolved
by
the
decisionmaker
were
inherently
subjective,
were
inherently
controversial,
and
therefore
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
necessary.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
the
secretary
in
his
new
regulations
has
not
called
for
any
kind
of
a
hearing.
he's
continuing
on
the
same
guidelines
and
procedures.
mr.
michael
c.
towers
he
could
under
the
statute.
and
in
fact,
under
a
similar
statute,
the
mine
safety
act,
when
it
was
declared
unconstitutional
for
the
same
reason,
the
secretary
instituted
hearing
procedures.
it
was
a
hearing
neutral
statute
as
well.
so
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
case
can
be
resolved
without
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional
by
simply
finding
and
ruling
that
the
secretary
must
institute
procedures
which
meet
the
minimum
requirements
of
procedural
due
process.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
correct
and
ask
that
it
be
affirmed.
