well,
mr.
pincus,
once
the
initial
order
has
been
entered
by
the
secretary
of
labor
insisting
on
reinstatement
of
an
employee
the
employer
doesn't
want
to
have,
then
it
becomes
crucial
to
the
employer,
does
it
not,
to
have
a
prompt
hearing,
assuming
that's
constitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
that
point
the
post-order
hearing
becomes
vital,
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet,
there's
no
time
limit
in
the
statute
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
the
time
limits
in
the
secretary's
regulations
jurisdictional
or
directory?
