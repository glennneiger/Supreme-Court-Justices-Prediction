ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
and
the
law
in
this
case
establish
that
there
was
not
a
lawful
probation
search
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
california;
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
never
on
probation
under
california
law;
and
that
he
never
waived
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
further,
the
facts
and
the
law
establish
that
the
search
was
conducted
in
bad
faith,
and
was
objectively
unreasonable.
this
court
would
not
even
have
to
look
at
the
notice
issue,
this
court
would
not
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
the
february
27th
order
was
effective,
and
i
direct
this
specifically
to
justice
o'connor,
because
regardless...
regardless
of
what
this
court
decides
about
the
effectiveness
of
the
order
that
was
arrived
at
on
february
27,
this
search
was
not
justified
as
a
probation
search.
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
california,
there
must
be
reasonable
belief
that
a
person
is
in
violation
of
a
condition
of
probation,
and
the
alleged
violations
that
were
brought
to
the
court
in
this
case
all
occurred
prior
to
february
27th,
prior
to
the
date
of
that
order.
there
was
never
any
allegation
that
there
was
any
violation
of
probation
or
any
terms
thereof
during
the
term
of
probation,
which
in
this
case,
assuming
the
best
for
the
government,
is
between
february
27,
and
the
date
of
the
search,
march
3rd.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
the
court
of
appeals
rested
in
judgment
in
part
on
the
ground--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--they
did,
your
honor.
but
they
couched
this
under
the
rubric
of
good
faith.
and
you'll
find
that
all
of
the
discussion
about
good
faith,
when
the
court
has
asked
before
about
pretextual
search,
that's
precisely
what
it's
talking
about.
this
was
not
a
search
that
was
taken
for
the
purposes
of
probation
supervision
or
violation,
because
there
was
absolutely
allegation
of
any
violation
that
took
place
from
the
date
of
the
reinstatement
order.
and
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
replete
with
this
information.
but
they
discussed
it
under
the
objects
of
good
faith.
and
i
think
this
goes
to
both
good
faith,
but
it
also
goes
to
the
grounds
that
this
is
not
a
proper
probation
search
under
california
law.
it
provides
this
court
with
an
independent
state
ground
to
disregard
every
other
issue
in
this
case
and
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
and
the
case
law
is
absolutely
clear
on
this.
people
v.
bremmer.
united
states
v.
johnson.
the
suspicion
must
be
grounded
on
present
activity.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
the
court
of
appeals
used
this
in
their
decision
to
show
why
these
officers
were
not
objectively
in
good
faith.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
they
were
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment.
but
it's
clear
from
all
the
facts
in
this
case
that
it
wasn't
a
probation
search,
and
it
can't
be
justified.
and
that
would
end
the
matter.
further--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--the
officer--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--the
officer
in
this
case
was
in
fact
ms.
bazar,
the
prosecutor.
her
sins
must
be
visited
on
the
other
executing
officers,
as
i'm
sure
we'll
all
agree.
she
was
present
at
the
february
27th
hearing.
and
she
knew
what
the
order
of
the
court
was
reinstated.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
she
got
to
the
door
and
she
had
an
exchange
with
the
defendant,
she
corroborated
this,
not
by
saying,
you've
always
been
on
probation,
mr.
merchant.
but
what
she
said
was,
notice
last
week
to
your
lawyer
was
notice
to
you.
she
knew
that
he
hadn't
been
on
probation
prior
to
february
27th.
and
it's
clear
from
her
conversation
that
there
wasn't
any
question
but
that
he
was
on
probation.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
well,
what
she
really--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--well,
she
heard
the
judge.
she
was
in
court
on
february
27th,
and
she
heard
the
judge
say,
reinstate
it.
further,
her...
she
indicated
she
didn't
know--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--"reinstated"
means
to
start
from
now.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
well,
she
knew
that
he
had
never
been
assigned
a
probation
officer.
the
solicitor
general's
argument
that
this
is
common
in
california
is
absolutely
contrary
to
california
law,
because
there
is
no
case
of
formal
probation
where
a
person
isn't
assigned
a
formal
probation.
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
when
the
probation
department
received
the
document
on
the
sentencing
proceedings
of
november
14th,
that
they
made
a
notation
that
all
of
the
proceedings
were
suspended
pending
appeal.
because
he
wasn't
on
probation.
he
had
no
probation
officer.
she
knew
that.
and
when
she
saw
him
on
march
3rd,
she
didn't
say,
you've
always
been
on
probation.
she
said,
didn't
your
lawyer
tell
you
about
the
hearing
last
week
when
you
were
placed
on
probation.
and
the
reason
she
didn't
do
a
search
originally
was
because
she
knew
he
wasn't
on
probation.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
they
did
not.
they
just
indicated
that
he
didn't
have
notice
of
the
proceeding
on
february
27th.
but
she's
absolutely
responsible
to
know
what
the
state
of
the
law
in
california
is.
she's
a
lawyer.
and
the
state
of
the
california
law
is
clear--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--she
can
also,
though,
be
in
bad
faith
and
try
to
get
a
search
when
she
has
no
probable
cause
or
no
exigency,
which
is
precisely
what
we
claim
she
did
in
this
case.
because
when
she
went
to
the
court
on
february
27,
she
did
not
for
a
moment
tell
the
court
what
her
intention
was;
not
that
she
should
be
subject
to
probation
supervision,
justice
scalia,
but
that
she
wanted
to
do
search.
and
the
record
and
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case
indicates
that
she
knew
she
wanted
to
do
a
search
before
she
went
down
there
to
reinstate.
and
she
had
an
obligation,
if
she
was
unsure,
to
say
to
that
judge
on
february,
your
honor,
are
you
ruling
that
he
was
on
probation,
or
are
you
putting
him
on
probation
now.
she
purposely
didn't
do
that.
she
couched
that
motion,
clarification,
reinstatement,
both.
she
got
an
order
reinstating.
she
didn't
tell
the
judge
what
she
was
going
to
do.
she
didn't
tell
the
lawyer
what
she
was
going
to
do.
but
she
told
her
buddies
in
the
police
department
before
she
got
there,
i'll
go
get
this
thing
done
in
court
because
i'm
not
sure,
and
then
we'll
do
a
search.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
she
did
not,
your
honor.
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
and
in
part
in
its
opening
brief
misstates
the
basis
for
the
california
law
regarding
individuals'
rights
with
respect
to
probation.
and
it's
clear
that
it
is
a
contract
theory
on
which
the
state
of
california
proceeds.
in
other
words,
it's
a
quid
pro
quo.
we
give
up
a
little
bit
maybe
in
terms
of
doing
time,
and
we
accept
certain
conditions
of
probation.
it
is
not
the
situation
where
your
parole
search
is
slapped
on
you
like
it
is
in
the
case
that
he
cites,
the
bergerman
case,
and
that
you
have
absolutely
no
question
about
whether
or
not
you
have
to
comply.
you
must
consent.
and
i
say
that
there
is
absolutely
no
consent
in
this
record
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
probation.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
no,
he
did
not
sign
anything,
your
honor,
that
said
that
he
consented.
he
said,
i
have
received,
i
have
read,
i
ave
understood.
he
never
consented.
and
the
reason
he
didn't
consent,
and
it
should
be
noted,
that
he
signed
that
form
after
the
stay
was
granted,
knowing
of
course
that
the
stay
would
be
granted.
because
bail
on
appeal
is
a
matter
of
right
on
a
misdemeanor
in
california.
after
the
stay
is
granted,
he
signs.
never
a
consent.
and
it's
critical
to
note
that
one
of
the
rights
he
has
under
the
state
of
california
law,
and
i
cite
in
re
osslo,
is
that
he
can
reject
the
terms
of
probation,
and
he
need
not
do
that
at
the
time
of
the
initial
sentencing;
he
can
do
that
after
the
appeal.
and
that's
a
very,
very,
very
substantial
right
that
he
knew
that
he
possessed.
and
there
is
absolutely
no
specific
knowing
waiver
in
the
record
of
this
case
that
he
ever
consented
to
the
terms
of
probation.
the
fact
that
he
received
and
he
read
and
he--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--that
is
true,
justice.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
that's
true.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
well,
it's
our
position,
that
hearing
that
was
conducted
on
february
27th,
first
of
all
the
order
that
the
judge
gave
confirmed
that
he
was
not
on
probation
prior
to
february
27th,
because
it
reinstated.
second,
the
order
was
defective
for
five
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
violated
the
state
law
of
this
case
in
people
v.
merchant,
that
he
had
a
right
to
have
notice.
it
basically
was
the
time
set
for
an
initial
imposition
of
sentencing,
and
there's
no
way
an
attorney,
without
a
waiver
on
file,
can
proceed
in
that
fashion,
when
he
has
a
right
to
defend
and
be
present,
and
where
there
are
very,
very
substantial
rights
to
be
taken
away
in
such
a
proceeding.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
it
is,
your
honor.
it's
based
on
both
federal
constitutional
law
and
it's
based
on
state
law.
and
it's
based
on
the
line
of
federal
cases
which
say
that
whenever
rights
to
defend
and
to
be
present
are
implicated,
that
you
have
a
right
to
be
there.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
well,
it
was
a
very
important
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
because
what
happened
is,
the
superior
court,
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
in
the
county
in
which
this
probation
violation
took
place,
issued
its
appellate
decision
in
the
case
of
people
v.
merchant,
superior
court,
which
said
that
he
had
no
notice
of
these
proceedings
and
it
violated
california
law.
and
that
is
a
major
part
of
the
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit.
further,
it's
our
position
that
it
violated
state
law...
his
state
law
right
to
be
present
at
the
proceedings.
and
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
be
present
under
the
state
law
of
california.
there
was
no
waiver
on
file,
nor
at
that
proceeding
did
the
judge
ever
stop,
or
did
counsel
ever
say--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--well,
it
was--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--it's
our
position
that
the
trial
judge
and
the
court
has
to
proceed
in
a
fair
manner,
and
has
to
be
assured
that
the
defendant's
rights
are
protected.
in
this
case,
there
was
never
any
inquiry
at
all
about
whether
or
not
mr.
merchant
had
consented;
whether
or
not
the
lawyer
had
permission
for
him
to
be
there.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
the
answer
is,
when
constitutional
rights
are
being
implicated,
as
they
were
here,
the
right
to
give
up
his
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
his
right
to
bear
arms,
which
was
quite
critical
to
him,
being
a
gun
collector,
those
are
not
the
kinds
of
things
that
under
state
or
federal
law,
that
the
state...
that
the
judge
can
do
without
at
least
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
in
his
interest.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
well,
i
think
one
of
the
cases
cited
by...
cited
in
the
briefs
is
united
states
v.
gagnon.
there
was
an
inquiry
into,
for
example,
the
jury
room
for
a
second,
where
nobody
was
being
examined,
there
was
some
inquiry
about
the
conduct
of
a
juror.
the
defendant
wasn't
present.
the
court
rules
no
problem.
but
here,
this
is
very,
very
critical.
because
the
defendant
in
this
case
basically
could
dictate
the
outcome
of
those
proceedings
by
rejecting
probation,
or
seeking
a
modification.
and
he
had
a
right
to
ensure
that
that
would
not
occur
until
his
stay
had
evaporated,
until
his
appeal
was
over.
he
had
a
contract
with
the
court.
if
he
has...
if
the
court
rules
that
there
was
a
consent,
he
had
a
contract.
and
the
contract
is,
was
a
condition
precedent.
i
don't
have
to
give
up
these
rights
until
my
appeal
is
over.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
i
think
as
long
as
it's
voluntary
on
the
defendant's
part.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
because
the
court
has
the
obligation
to
ensure
that
the
proceedings
are
fair.
and
without
that
inquiry
by
anybody,
by
the
prosecutor
or
by
the
court,
mr.
merchant's
constitutional
rights
were
terribly
implicated
when
he
had
a
right
at
that
hearing
to
dictate
the
outcome
by
refusing
that
probation.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
he
could.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
they
couldn't
have
imposed
the
jail
sentence,
because
he
has
an
automatic
right
to
bail,
pending
appeal,
on
a
misdemeanor.
and
the
appeal
was
pending
at
the
time.
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
the
government
was
guided
by
bad
faith
all
along.
and
i
think
if
the
court
looks
at
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
and
determines
what
ms.
bazar,
who
is
in
fact
law
enforcement
in
this
case,
what
her
purpose
was.
her
purpose
was
always
to
do
a
search.
never,
ever,
to
be
sure
that
he
was
complying
with
the
actual
terms
of
probation.
she
got
a
court
order
to
do
a
search
without
a
warrant,
without
probable
cause,
and
without
any
emergency.
it
was
not
assist
in
compliance
with
any
of
the
terms
of
probation.
now,
she
was
in
court,
and
she
knew
the
sentence
had
been
stayed
on
november
14th.
she
said
she
was
unclear
what
that
meant.
she
also
knew
on
february
11th
that
he
had
never
been
assigned
to
a
probation
officer.
and
it's
totally
disingenuous
for
the
solicitor
general...
for
the
court
to
say
that
that
is
typical;
because
it's
not
typical.
and
she
knew
it.
and
she
knew
he
wasn't
on
probation.
and
she
even
testified
that
one
of
the
officers
said,
does
he
have
a
probation
officer.
this
is
a
search
of
a
private
residence
based
on
a
pretextual
probation
search
without
a
probation
officer.
this
is
not
a
circumstance
where
somebody
wants
to
do
a
probation
search
out
in
the
field,
a
moving
vehicle,
and
they've
got
to
act
on
the
moment.
this
is
a
considered
decision
to
do
a
search.
and
she
had
it
in
her
mind
prior
to
the
reinstatement
proceedings.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
i'm
sorry,
suppose
there
had
been
no
stay?
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
the
case
was
pending
on
appeal,
but
there
hadn't
been
a
stay?
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
and
the
judge
had
denied
a
stay,
and
said
you're
on
probation?
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
and
there'd
been
no
probation
officer.
then
i
think
it's
a
case
where
you'd
have
to
look
into
the
objectively
reasonable
acts
that
occurred
on
that--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--well,
if
she...
if
in
fact
there
was--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--the
answer
to
the
question
is,
what
complaints
did
she
have?
what
reasonable
cause
did
she
have
to
search
between
the
time
of
the
imposition
of
probation
and
the
time
of
that
search?
if
she
has
reasonable
cause,
that's
a
factor.
and
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
have
a
probation
officer
is
a
major
factor--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--absolutely.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
i
don't
know
that,
yet.
but
i
know
that
the...
that
the
federal
courts
protect
their
probationers,
because
under
federal
law,
without
a
probation
officer,
this
search
would
be
totally
illegal.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
if
she
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
a
violation,
postdating
the
date
of
the
imposition
of
probation,
i
say
fine.
why
didn't
he
have
a
probation
officer?
that's
just
one
inquiry
to
be
made.
but
it's
possible
that
the
reason--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--there
are
certain
standards
to
make
a
probation
search
legitimate.
one
is
that
it
has
to
be
reasonably
related
to
probation
supervision.
and
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
probation
violation.
if
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
violation,
post-sentencing,
and
prior
to
the
time
that
he
was
able
to
connect
up
with
his
probation
officer,
i
think
it
could
be
reasonable.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
then
i
think
it's
reasonable,
if
the
fourth
amendment
says
you
can
do
that.
that
isn't
what
happened
in
this
case.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
oh,
that
would
certainly
be
connected
with
a
condition
of
his
probation.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
sure,
he
has
to
obey
all
laws,
of
course.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
it's
couched
in
different
ways
in
different
clauses.
and
the
courts
have
been--
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
--the
consent
to
search
in
this
case
was,
with
or
without
reasonable
cause
by
a
police
officer
or
probation
officer...
excuse
me,
with
or
without
probable
cause,
but
there
must
be
reasonable
cause.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
absolutely.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
that's
correct.
for
all
of
the
reasons
in
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
there
must
be
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
probation
violation.
it
must
be
reasonably
related
to
probation
supervision.
and
the
scope
must
be
appropriate.
on
february
27th
in
this...
again,
going
to
the
good
faith
issue...
when
ms.
bazar
was
in
court,
she
knew
the
defendant
wasn't
present.
she
knew
that
there
was
absolutely
no
waiver
on
file.
she
knew
that
the
judge
had
issued
an
order
reinstating
him.
she
never
told
the
judge
what
she
intended
to
do,
not
to
make
sure
he
was
abiding
by
probation,
but
to
do
a
search.
she
basically,
in
our
view,
committed
a
fraud
upon
the
court
because
what
she
really
wanted
was
a
warrantless
search
of
his
house,
and
she
didn't
tell
the
judge.
all
of
the
complaints,
by
the
time
that
march
3rd
rolls
around,
all
of
the
complaints
are
post...
are
pre-february
27.
there
are
no
current
complaints.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
complaints
were
in
january
and
very
early
february.
they're
at
least
a
month
old.
she
knows
when
she
gets
to
the
door
that
the
defendant
does
not
think
that
he
is
on
probation.
and
what
happens
at
the
door
in...
at
the
door
of
the
search
in
this
case
is
quite
extraordinary.
this
is
not
a
case
where
there's
knock
knock
knock,
bang
right
in
and
do
your
search.
there
is
a
20-minute...
not
two
or
three
minutes...
20-minute
colloquy
between
this
prosecutor
and
various
other
individuals.
one
of
the
people
is
mr.
merchant.
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
consent
search.
mr.
merchant
says,
i
didn't
consent,
and
i'm
not
on
probation.
she
didn't
say,
forget
that,
we're
doing
this
search.
she
said,
didn't
your
lawyer
tell
you?
he
says,
no,
and
then
he
calls
his
lawyer,
and
that
lawyer
confirms
to
that
prosecutor
right
then
and
there,
prior
to
the
search,
that
he
is
not
on
probation.
this
court
just
last
week
ruled
in
maryland
v.
garrison
that
the
objectively
reasonable
facts
are
critical.
and
this
court
commented
that
in
that
case
the
two
individuals
that
were
seen
in
the
hallway,
neither
of
them
said
anything,
neither
of
them
warned
these
officers
that
there
were
really
two
apartments
there,
not
one
apartment.
mr.
merchant
said,
no,
i
don't
have
notice.
mr.
foster,
the
lawyer,
i
don't
have
notice.
she
knew
it.
she
didn't
say,
oh,
you've
had
notice
all
along.
she
said,
too
bad.
in
my
legal
judgment,
notice
to
your
lawyer
is
notice
to
you.
but
that
isn't
the
end
of
this
case.
because
then
what
happened
is
the
lawyer,
mr.
foster,
in
a
state
of
frenzy,
called
the
judge.
and
the
judge
had
a
conversation
with
this
prosecutor,
prior
to
the
instigation
of
this
search,
which
puts
new
meaning
of
the
word,
bad
faith.
and
what
this
judge
said,
prior
to
the
instigation
of
this
search
was,
quote,
and
he
said
it
many
times,
according
to
the
prosecutor:
don't
take
this
conversation
to
mean
that
i
have
any
opinion
as
to
whether
you
should
or
should
not
be
doing
this
search.
i
liked
this
to
the
case
of
united
states
v.
leon,
and
i
say,
can
you
imagine
the
judge
in
leon
signing
a
document
that's
supposed
to
make
out
probable
cause.
and
he
gives
him
a
piece
of
paper,
and
he
says,
don't
take
this
piece
of
paper
to
mean
that
i
have
any
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
you
should
or
should
not
be
doing
this
search.
the
judge's
imprimatur
was
totally
lacking
on
this
search.
it
lacked
good
faith.
ms.
penelope
m.
cooper
it
is
indeed.
if
there
are
no
other
questions?
