that
was
the
first
he
knew
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
doesn't
give
you
any
problem,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
lost
his
rights
without
even
knowing
that
he
had
lost
them?
justice

i'm
not
talking
about
when
he
was
there.

justice

and
he
didn't
know
about

until
they
came
to
his
door?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
two
minutes
later
they
went
to
search
him?

well,
we
aren't
interested
in
the
california
law
as
it...
at
least
i'm
not...
apply
to
probation.
i
want
to
know
how
it
applies
to
the
people
that
did
this.
they
were
police
officers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
larkin,
there
weren't
just
police
there.
there
was
a
prosecutor
there,
wasn't
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i
mean
they
weren't
without
legal
advice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
knew
the
facts
of
the
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
knew
that
the
respondent
was
not
in
court.

objects
to
the
legality
of
the
hearing.
the
respondent
objects
to
not
knowing
about
the
hearing.
those
are
two
different
points,
i
think.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
had
been
at
the
hearing,
he
would
have
no
case
at
all,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
he
wasn't
at
the
hearing,
that
doesn't
help
him
at
all,
you
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
should
he
be
there?
