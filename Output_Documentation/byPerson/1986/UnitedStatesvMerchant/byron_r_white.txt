well,
on
the
notice
point,
do
you
ask
us
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
under
california
law,
the
judge
stayed
the
entire
sentence
rather
than...
stayed
the
entire
judgment,
rather
than
just
a
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
even
if...
even
if
this
was
an
original
sentencing
hearing,
notice
to
the
attorneys
is
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
larkin,
do
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
as
holding
that
the
search
was
objectively
unreasonable
because
it
was
pretextual?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
we
reach
the
leon
matter,
for
you
to
win,
we
have
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
holding,
what,
that
it
was
pretextual,
or
that
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
do
have
to
disagree
with
it,
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
finding
that
it
was
pretextual
and
therefore
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
we
would
have
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
finding
that
it
did
not
comply
with
the
good
faith
objectives,
and
whatever
the
word
"pretextual"
might
mean.
