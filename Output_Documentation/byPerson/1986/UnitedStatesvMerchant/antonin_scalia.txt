don't
we
have
to
get
to
the
good
faith
ground
anyway?
i
don't
understand
how
the
court
of
appeals
felt
it
had
to
do
both
of
those
issues.
if
it
wasn't
a
good
faith
probation
search,
it
didn't
matter
whether
he
was
on
probation
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
matter,
though?
if...
if
it
was
a
pretextual
search,
wouldn't
it
be
unnecessary
to
reach
the
other
issues?
or
would
it
still
be
necessary
to
reach
some
of
the
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
how
they
did
it.
i
mean,
as
a
real
world
matter.
if
you
find
that
it
was
a
pretextual
search,
wouldn't
that
be
an
end
of
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice

i
thought
the
point
you
were
making,
mr.
larkin,
was
that
you
need
notice
for
those
matters
that
would
affect
your
primary
conduct.
and
whether
he
can
own
firearms
or
not
affects
his
primary
conduct.
but
whether
he
has
drugs
on
his
property
or
not
is
totally
unaffected
by
this
order,
isn't
it?
he's
not
supposed
to
have
drugs
on
his
property
anyway.
there's
another
law
that
already
makes
it
improper
for
him
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
that
you
weren't
taking
it
back.
i
thought...
didn't
think
you
were
explaining
it.
i
thought
that
that
was
the...
i
thought
that
that
was
the
distinction
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
larkin,
wasn't
it
that
the
effect
of
the
second
hearing
was
to
confer
his
agreement?
i
mean,
was
it
clear
that
he
would
have
agreed
to
the
probation
if
he
had
known
that
the
terms
of
it
included
that
he
couldn't
have
guns
and
consented
to
a
search,
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
agree
with
you
that
notice
was
not
necessary
so
long
as
the
attorney
was
advised,
but
i
think
he
should
have
had
a
right
to
be
present
at
the
second
hearing.
how
would
that
affect
my
decision
in
this
case?
