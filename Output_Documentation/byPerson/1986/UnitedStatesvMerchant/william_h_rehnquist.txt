chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-1672,
united
states
against
william
d.
merchant.
mr.
larkin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
this
court
granted
your
petition,
not
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
larkin,
what
do
you
mean
when
you
use
the
word
"pretextual"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
those
totally
distinct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
justice
o'connor's
question
is,
if
you...
or
at
least
that's
the
way
i
understood
it...
if
you
find
that
the
consent
to
search
provision
and
the
probation
decree
has
no
flaw
in
it,
you
don't
need
to
get
to
any
good
faith
exceptions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
say
this
was
a
valid
search,
i
would
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
difficulty
saying
it
was
an
invalid
search
after
our
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
decided
it
wasn't,
i
doubt
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
contradict
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
cooper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
cooper,
did
the
court
of
appeals
rest
its
judgment
on
the
ground
that
you've
just
stated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
ground...
i
asked
you
a
question
i
think
you
can
answer
by
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
cooper.
mr.
larkin,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
judgment
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
85-1672,
united
states
versus
william
d.
merchant.
the
case
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
