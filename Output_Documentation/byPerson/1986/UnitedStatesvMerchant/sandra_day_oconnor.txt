but
may
i
verify,
mr.
larkin,
if
we
felt
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
the
notice
rule
that
it
made,
we
could
reverse
on
that
ground,
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter?

mr.
larkin,
i'm
getting
confused
by
this
discussion.
now,
i
thought
the
defendant
was
personally
present
at
his
original
sentencing
hearing,
when
the
terms
and
conditions
of
probation
were
presented
to
him;
and
he
looked
it
over
and
accepted
it
and
consented
to
the
probation
terms.
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
the
record
seems
to
support
that.
he
was
also
given
a
companion
jail
sentence
of
six
months.
his
lawyer
objected
to
the
jail
sentence.
following
that,
the
court
entered
a
stay
of
his
sentence,
and
it
was
the
position
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
later
that
that
stay
apparently
was
effective
for
both
probation
and
the
jail
term.
the
state
moved
for
a
clarification
of
that,
and
the
defendant
was
not
personally
present
at
the
hearing
on
clarification.
but
if
we
conclude
that
he
didn't
have
to
be
present,
and
if
the
court
then
vacated
its
stay
or
corrected
itself
so
that
the
stay
was
not
effective
on
the
probation,
then
why
wouldn't
the
probation
be
in
full
effect
from
that
moment
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.

right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
not
before
us
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
coming
up
in
another
case
this
term.
