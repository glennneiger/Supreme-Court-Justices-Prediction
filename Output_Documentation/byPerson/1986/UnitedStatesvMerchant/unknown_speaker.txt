state
law
ground.
unknown
speaker
they
were
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
officers
thought
that
the...
that
the
original
probation
order
was
the
one
that
was
valid?
unknown
speaker
than...
then
the...
then
the
information
that
they
had,
which
they'd
acquired
earlier
about
his
having
firearms,
would
in
their
mind
have
been
a
violation
of
probation.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
it
was
not
clear
at
all
in
the
record
whether
she
had
conceded
the
position
that
the
original
order
wasn't
effective,
and
that
the
later
one
was
just
to
make
doubly
sure,
so
to
speak.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
from
the
record
that
she
had
conceded
that
there
was
nothing
in
effect
until
february
27?
unknown
speaker
what
does
"reinstated"
mean?
unknown
speaker
start
from
now?
i
think
to
the
contrary.
i
would
think
it
means,
it's
been
around
and
i'm
renewing
it
now.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it's
at
least
a
hard
question.
did
the
court
of
appeals
make
a...
hold
on
the
point
as
to
what
she
knew?
unknown
speaker
but
she
can
make
a
mistake,
just
the
way
police
officers
can
mistakes.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
that
she
didn't
advise...
i
thought
she
had
advised
the
court
that
she
wanted
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
about
the...
the
record
that
indicates
that
at
the
original
sentencing,
the
respondent
was
present
and
signed
the
form
acknowledging
that
he
understood
and
consented
to
the
search
and
firearm
conditions
of
probation?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
the
courts
below
didn't
deal
with
that
state
law
question.
unknown
speaker
and
so
conceivably
that
could
be
open
on
any
remand.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
think
that
that
would
necessarily
govern
our
decision
on
whether
notice
to
defendant's
counsel
of
the
february
27th
hearing
was
sufficient
for
purposes
of
due
process.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a...
is
your
statement
there
based
on
what
you
conceive
federal
constitutional
law
to
be?
unknown
speaker
insofar
as
it's
based
on
state
law,
our
court,
i
think,
is
very
unlikely
to
decide
this
case
here
in
this
court
on
any
state
law
basis
that
was
not
a
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
unknown
speaker
no,
he
had
a
right
to
be
present.
no
one
deprived
him
of
his
right
to
be
present.
his
lawyer
was
advised.
if
it
was
anyone's
fault,
it
was
his
lawyer's
fault.
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
lot
of
rights
that
you
have
at
a
trial
which
are
not
exercised.
and
so
long
as
your
lawyer
is
advised
that
the
proceeding
is
to
be
held,
if
he
doesn't
tell
you,
is
that
the
state's
fault?
unknown
speaker
xxx
innumerable
things
that
go
on
in
a
trial,
civil
or
criminal,
where
the
court
relies
on
the
attorney
to
advise
the
client.
does
the
court
have
to
call
up
the
client
everytime
and
say,
has
your
lawyer
told
you
thus
and
such?
unknown
speaker
that's
your
test,
when
constitutional
rights
are
implicated?
how
are
you
going
to
draw
that
line?
when
are
constitutional
rights
not
implicated
in
a
criminal
trial?
what
stages
of
the
criminal
trial
won't
the
court
have
to
check
to
see
that
the
client
was
advised
of
everything
by
the
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
all
that.
but
what
i
find
it
hard
to
discover
is
why
it's
the
state's
fault.
no
maybe
it's
his
lawyer's
fault
for
not
telling
him.
surely
he
didn't
have
to
be
there.
the
court
could
go
ahead.
if
the
lawyer
had
told
him
and
he
had
said,
i
don't
want
to
go
to
that
hearing;
you
go
for
me.
that
would
have
been
legal,
right?
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
the
trial
can't
proceed
without
him
present
at
that
moment?
unknown
speaker
right,
okay.
so
the
judge
doesn't
know
that
the
defendant
must
be
there.
maybe
he
just
didn't
want
to
come.
so
why
isn't
it
the
lawyer's
fault?
and
maybe
he
has
a
cause
of
action
against
his
lawyer
for...
for
malrepresentation?
maybe
he
has
some
remedy
for
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel.
but
why
is
it
the
state's
fault?
unknown
speaker
xxx
probation
and
insist
on
going
to
jail.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
could...
suppose
the
judgment
and
the
sentence
had
not
been
stayed
at
all.
there
had
just
been
an
appeal,
but
she
was
on
probation.
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
this
prosecutor
took
the
police
out,
and
knowing
that
there
was
a
probation...
that
probation
was
in
existence,
just
carried
out
this
same
search,
but
there
hadn't
been
any
probation
officer
assigned,
and
her
whole
purpose
was
to
search
for
criminal--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
what
about
the
case
then?
unknown
speaker
she
knows...
she
knows
that
the
defendant
is
on
probation.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that
reasonable
cause
requirement
is
a
state
law,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
fourth
amendment
law?
you
don't
know
that
yet,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it
could
possibly
be
objectively
reasonable
on
the
facts
i
posited?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
then...
then
you
could
always
consider
it
to
be
a
probation
search?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
the
fourth
amendment...
suppose
the
fourth
amendment
just
permits
probation
officers
to
make
random
searches?
unknown
speaker
but
again,
assuming
that
the
probation
was
in
effect,
and
if
one
of
the
conditions
of
probation
were
that
he
obey
the
law,
and
the
probation
search...
or
the
search
was
based
on
reasonable
grounds
to
think
that
he
was
manufacturing
illegal
drugs,
would
you
say
that
that
was
not
connected
with
a
condition
of
his
probation?
unknown
speaker
in
view
of
that
condition,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
the
consent
to
search
is
just
a
consent
to
search
without
a
warrant,
it's
not
a
consent
to
search
without
reasonable
suspicion?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
this
consent...
what
was
the
consent
to
search
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
under
california
law.
unknown
speaker
even
if
there's
consent,
that's
only...
that
consent
does
not
waive
reasonable
cause?
unknown
speaker
or
reasonable
suspicion,
or
whatever
you
call
it.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
was
before
he
was
on
probation.
the
gunfire
was
back
in
january,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
anyway,
it
was
in
january.
it
wasn't
after
february
27th?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
means
that
it's
essential
for
you
to
establish
not
merely
that
the
prosecutor
when
she
went
in
thought
that
the
february
27th
order
was
valid
without
notice,
but
also
that
she
thought
when
she
went
in
that
that
order
did
not
do
anything
new;
that
the
probation
was
in
effect
way
back
from,
when
was
it,
january.
