justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
this
final
question?
did
i
understand
you
earlier
to
say
that
you
do
not
challenge
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
california
law
that
the
order
of
february
27
was
the
order
that
we
have
to
look
at
primarily
here?
in
other
words,
that
was
the
order,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
court
below
considered
to
be
the
initial
imposition
of
probation.
do
you
challenge
that?
