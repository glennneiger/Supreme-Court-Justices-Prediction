mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
issues
in
this
case
stem
from
the
march
3,
1981
search
of
respondent's
farmhouse.
that
search
was
carried
out
under
the
authority
granted
not
by
a
search
warrant
but
by
a
consent-to-search
clause
in
the
judgment
of
probation
and
due
to
the
respondent's
sentencing
proceeding.
that
proceeding
followed
respondent's
convictions
on
two
firearms
charges.
and
that
sentence,
as
we
now
know,
was
stayed.
the
stay
led
to
the
second
proceeding
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
the
february
27,
1981
hearing,
that
came
on
the
prosecutor's
motion
for
clarification
or
modification
of
the
original
order
of
a
stay
entered
by
the
trial
court.
at
that
hearing,
respondent's
counsel
was
present,
and
he
had
been
notified.
respondent,
however,
had
not
been
notified
of
the
hearing,
and
he
was
not
there.
at
the
hearing,
which
was
very
brief,
the
state
municipal
court
stated
that
it
would
grant
the
motion
for
clarification
and
that
the
conditions
of
probation
were
reinstated.
the
search
of
respondent's
farmhouse
was
carried
out
four
days
later.
during
the
search,
the
members
of
the
team
discovered
a
large
cache
of
firearms
and
ammunition,
and
a
narcotics
laboratory.
after
respondent
was
prosecuted
in
federal
court
on
several
narcotics
charges,
he
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
seized
in
the
search.
the
district
court
denied
the
suppression
motion
for
two,
independent
reasons.
first,
the
district
court
concluded
that
respondent
was
on
probation
at
the
time
of
the
search,
and
that
the
search
was
lawful
under
the
consent
to
search
clause
in
his
judgment
of
probation.
second,
and
in
any
event,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
members
of
the
search
team,
and
indeed,
even
respondent's
own
attorney,
all
held
a
reasonable
and
good
faith
belief
that
they
were
authorized
to
conduct
a
search
by
virtue
of
the
february
27
order
entered
by
the
municipal
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
at
the
outset,
the
court
concluded
that
respondent
was
not,
in
fact,
on
probation
at
the
time
of
the
search,
because
the
original
sentence
had
been
stayed
in
its
entirety,
and
not
just
to
period
of
confinement.
the
court
then
went
on
to
address
the
order
entered
at
the
february
27
hearing.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
order
entered
at
that
proceeding,
and
its
terms,
was
a
nullity
because
respondent
was
not
personally
notified
about
the
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals,
after
entering
that
ruling,
went
on
to
address
the
government's
argument
that
the
good
faith
exception
that
this
court
adopted
in
leon
should
be
applicable
to
this
type
of
search.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
it
should
not,
because
it
believes
that
the
offices
could
not
have
had
an
objectively
reasonable
belief
that
this
was
a
search
related
to
probation.
in
the
court
of
appeals
view,
this
was
a
subterfuge
for
a
criminal
investigation.
the
court
of
appeals
granted
our
petition,
which
presented
both
the
notice
and
the
good
faith
questions.
respondent
has
sought
to
defend
the
judgment
below
on
an
additional
grounds,
namely--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--oh,
if
i
misspoke,
i'm
sorry.
this
court
granted
the
petition
limited
to
those
two
questions.
and
respondent
has
sought
to
defend
the
judgment
below
on
the
additional
ground
that
the
february
27
hearing
was
invalid
because
he
wasn't
present.
now,
there
are
several
different
ways
this
court
could
resolve
the
issues
in
this
case.
technically
speaking,
if
this
court
were
to
disagree
with
the
ninth
circuit
insofar
as
the
ninth
circuit
held
personal
notice
of
a
hearing
is
required,
this
court
could
reverse
the
judgment
below
on
that
ground
alone.
however,
the
court
could
also,
we
believe,
decide
the
case
solely
on
the
good
faith
grounds
that
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
decision
in
part
on.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
in
that
part
of
its
opinion
contained
several
different
elements,
we
believe.
the
court
started
out
its
analysis
by
talking
about
whether
the
officers
could
have
reasonably
relied
on
the
february
27
order.
and
it
ended
up
its
analysis
by
saying
that
the
good
faith
exception
should
not
apply
because
this
is
the
type
of
conduct
we
want
to
deter.
but
in
between
the
court
of
appeals
added
in
two
additional
elements
into
its
consideration.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
say
that
this
was
an
invalid
probation
search
because
it
went
beyond
the
scope
of
the
authority
that
a
police
officer
has.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
address
the
case--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--and
if
the
pretextual
nature
of
the
search
was
important
to
this
case.
we
haven't
challenged
the
court
of
appeals'
assumption
that
the
pretextual
nature
of
a
search
would
invalidate
a
probation
search.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
deals
with
the
substantive
law
of
probation
searches.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
and
that's
a
question
that
the
court
will
address
in
the
griffin
case.
insofar
as
this
case
goes,
given
that
assumption,
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
it
was
pretextual,
i
believe
you
would
be
right;
that
would
end
it.
but
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
or
in
law
for
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
this
was
a
pretextual
search.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
be
believing
that
the
purpose
of
this
search
was
not
to
enforce
his
probation,
but
was
to
conduct
a
criminal
investigation
of
something
else.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
in
our
view,
they
shouldn't
be.
the
reason
is,
here,
for
example,
if
respondent...
if
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
he
had
violated
some
of
the
law,
then
it
perhaps
would
be
possible
to
conduct
a
probation
search
on
that
ground.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
be
adding
into
the
calculus
on
this
part
of
the
issue
certain
factors
that
are
just
wrong
under
california
law
that's
clearly
established;
and
it
also
seemed
to
be
making
a
factual
finding
that's
inconsistent
with
what
the
district
court
found.
the
district
court
found
that
the
police
officers
and
the
prosecutor
had
an
objectively
reasonable
and
a
subjectively
reasonable
good
faith
belief
that
this
was
valid.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
say
that
because
there
were
certain
elements
not
present
in
this
type
of
search
that
it
believed
should
be
present,
it
couldn't
have
been
a
probation
search.
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
to
the
fact
that
he
hadn't
been
assigned
a
probation
officer,
but
that's
irrelevant
under
california
law.
a
police
officer
doesn't
need
the
authorization
of
a
probation
officer
to
carry
out
a
search
of
this
type,
and
a
probation
officer
doesn't
need
to
accompany
a
police
officer.
in
addition,
the
facts
under
california
law
that
a
probation
officer
has
not
been
assigned
to
a
probationer
doesn't
invalidate
the
judgment
of
probation.
that
type
of
fact
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
is
irrelevant.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
it
first
knew
of
the
order
on
february
27?
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
believe
when
he
was
told
at
the
door
was
probably
the
first
time.
he
didn't
know
of--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes.
now,
that
is
not
in
our
view--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
would
give
me
a
problem
if
they
tried
to
revoke
his
probation
for
violating
a
condition
of
his
probation.
because
then
it
would
be
unfair
to
punish
him
for
something
he
didn't
know
about.
but
we're
not
prosecuting
him
in
this
case
for
possessing
firearms.
we're
prosecuting
him
in
this
case
for
having
a
narcotics
lab.
and
that's
a
matter
that,
independently
of
this,
he
should
know
that
he's
not
entitled
to
possess
in
his
house.
so
the
fact
that
he
didn't
know
of
the
entry
of
the
february
27
order--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
i
would
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
he
was
sentenced
on
november
14.
at
that
time,
the
trial
judge
clearly
told
him
that
the
probation
conditions
included,
one,
that
he
not
possess
firearms;
two,
that
he
consent
to
a
search.
he
was
there.
he
did
not
object
to
either
of
those.
he
objected
only
to
the
six
month
period
of
incarceration.
in
fact,
at
the
next
page
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
also
objected
to
the
trial
judge's
order
that
the
firearm
that
was--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
he
was
not
at
the
february
27
hearing,
and
he
was
not
notified
about
it.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
but
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
correct.
it's
our
position
that
the
california
superior
court
appellate
division
got
it
right
when
it
said
that
he
couldn't
have
his
probation
revoked
for
failing
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
his
probation;
but
that
didn't
mean
that
a
probation
officer,
in
this
case
a
police
officer,
could
not
cross
threshold
of
his
home
once
the
february
27
order
was
entered.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
but
under
california
law,
either
a
probation
officer
or
a
police
officer
can
conduct
a
search.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
at
the
time
of
the
search
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
i
will
directly
address
now
the
good
faith
argument
that
we've
made
in
our
brief.
i
will
not
address
the
notice
argument
that
we've
made
in
our
brief,
because
i
think
there's
virtually
nothing
that
can
be
said
in
defense
of
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling,
and
respondent
has
made
no
serious
effort
to
do
so.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
believe
technically
speaking
that
would
end
the
matter
at
this
time.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
view
has
clearly
signalled,
for
the
reasons
i
explained
to
justice
scalia,
how
it
views
this
case.
and
i
think
there's
no
doubt
that
if
the
case
goes
back
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
will
rely
on
some
of
the
reasons
given
in
the
second
part
of
its
opinion
to
find
that
the
search
here
was
unlawful
nonetheless.
but
i
will
not
address
the
notice
point
any
further,
and
will
speak
now
only
to
the
good
faith
point.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
disagree
with
that.
we
have
not
petitioned
on
that
issue.
we
have
not
challenged
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling.
our
only
argument
on
the
notice
issue
is
that,
for
the
reasons
we've
explained,
notice
to
a
defendant's
attorney
in
a
criminal
case
of
any
proceeding
that
occurs
during
that
case
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
any
due
process
notice
requirement.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
would
be
enough
for
the
purpose
of
notice.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
may
not
be
for
the
purpose
of
presence.
the
defendant
may
have
a
valid
claim
if
he
wasn't
present
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
but
for
purpose
of
notice,
that
would
be
sufficient
in
our
view.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
we--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
the
order
in
this
case,
the
february
27
order,
was...
dealt
with
a
stay
that
had
originally
been
imposed.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
i
said
he
couldn't
be...
if
the
conditions--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--in
our
view,
it
would
be
effective
for
bringing
into
play
the
authorization
that
was
contained
in
the
november
14
sentencing
order.
respondent,
in
our
view,
at
that
time--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--because
of
the
different
things,
the
consequences,
that
flow
from
the
order
coming
into
being.
the...
it's
our
position--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
he's...
it
would
be,
i'm
sure,
important
to
him
to
know
both
of
these.
but
the
question
is
whether
the
officer
who
then
walks
into
the
room
has
committed
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
in
this
case,
he
waived
his
rights--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
difference,
your
honor,
that
you're...
the
point
that
you're
making.
because
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
unfair
to
penalize
him
for
something
he
didn't
know
about.
but
you're
not
penalizing
him
by--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--conducting
a
probation
search.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
the...
it's
not
part
of
any
type
of
affirmative
disability
that
you're
imposing
on
him
for
violating
some
type
of
condition
that's
been
imposed
on
his
liberty.
if
he
can't
associate
with
someone
and
doesn't
know
about
it,
it
would
be
unfair
to
penalize
him
for
it.
but
you're
not
penalizing
him
by
allowing
the
probation
officer,
or
in
this
case,
the
police
officer,
simply
to
cross
the
threshold--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
the
adverse
consequences
in
this
case
flowed--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it's...
maybe
it's
not
a
difference
in...
even
if
it's
not
a
difference
in
kind,
it's
certainly
at
least
a
difference
in
degree
between
a
probation
officer
just
entering
your
home,
and
then
a
probation
officer
using
the
information
against
you
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
revoking
your
probation
and
putting
you
in
jail.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
i
agree.
i'm
not
taking
that
point
in
anyway.
i
was
just
trying
to
address
justice
stevens'
point
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
that
certainly
is
one
of
the
distinctions.
but
justice
stevens,
i
thought,
was
focussing
on
whether
it's
somehow
unfair
to
allow
the
probation
officer
just
to
cross
the
threshold.
and
to
that
extent--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--in
our
view,
for
the
reasons
that
i've
tried
to
explain,
the
fact
that
you're
just
entering
is
not
sufficiently
comparable
to
the
fact
that
you
are
ultimately
put
in
prison,
to
say
that
the
entry
is
itself
a
type
of
penalty
of
which
you
need
some
type
of
notice.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
our
position,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
there
is
no
procedural
flaw
in
the
february
27
hearing--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--either
of
notice
or
presence,
the
order
in
our
view
would
be
valid.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
respondent
has
challenged,
in
the
lower
courts
but
not
in
this
court,
that
order
to
the
consent
to
search
provision
entered
at
the
original
proceeding
on
the
ground
that
that's
substantively
invalid.
but
that
issue
isn't
before
the
court--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--in
this
case;
no,
that's
correct.
so
in
our
view,
if
there
were
no
procedural
obstacles
to
that,
the
order
would
be
valid
at
that
time.
but
for
the
purpose
of
the
good
faith
exception,
there
are
at
least
i
think
three
questions,
or
at
least
three
positions
we've
taken
that
relate
to
this
type
of
problem.
the
first
is
that
it's
objectively
reasonable
for
the
officers
to
rely
on
the
authority
that
they
were
granted
by--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--you
could
end
the
case
at
this
time
simply
by
ruling
on
the
notice
and/or
the
presence
grounds.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
this
court
would
not
need
to
go
further
than
that.
but
for
the
reasons
i've
given
you
earlier,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
of
appeals
has
clearly
signalled
how
they
view
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
by
that
what
i
mean,
your
honor,
is,
respondent
has
an
issue
that
he
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
he's
not
reasserted
here.
he
has
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
question,
whether
the
consent
to
search
provision
is
substantively
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
fully
agree.
but
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
notice
and
presence
questions
relate
to
the
procedural
regularity
of
the
february
27
hearing.
the
other
question
that
i
mentioned
that
is
mentioned
in
the
last
footnote
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
deals
with
the
substantive
validity
of
these
conditions
at
all.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
that
will
come
up
in
the
griffin
case.
so
the
court
will
decide...
perhaps
decide
that
type
of
issue
in
the
griffin
case.
but
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
before
the
court
in
this
particular
case.
now,
it's
our
view
that
the
officers,
as
i
said,
had
an
objectively
reasonable
belief
that
the
consent
to
search
clause
imposed
in
respondent's
november
14
judgment
of
probation
authorized
a
search
in
this
case.
these
types
of
conditions
are
not
unique
to
this
type
of
proceeding.
they're
well
established
in
california
law.
for
nearly
a
decade
prior
to
the
search
in
this
case,
consent
to
search
conditions
had
been
helf
to
be
valid
both
as
legitimate
conditions
of
probation
and
as
lawful
under
the
fourth
amendment.
california
supreme
court
expressly
addressed
the
validity
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
these
types
of
conditions
in
the
mason
case
in
1971,
and
between
the
date
of
that
case
and
the
date
of
the
search
in
this
case,
neither
the
california
supreme
court
nor
any
lower
california
court
said
that
these
were
disfavored
sources
of
authority.
in
these
circumstances,
we
believe
that
the
principles
that
the
court
discussed
in
leon
are
fully
applicable.
in
our
view,
the
two
central
principles
on
which
the
court
decision
there
rested
were,
first,
that
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
police
misconduct;
and
second,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
cannot
serve
that
purpose
where
the
officers
act
in
an
objectively
reasonable
belief
that
their
conduct
is
lawful.
it's
also
our
belief
that
the
officers
will
not
be...
should
not
be
required
to
draw
distinctions
among
the
different
types
of
authority
that
they
are
given,
between
the
authority
granted
by
a
statute
or
the
authority
granted
by
a
search
warrant
or
the
authority
granted
by
consent
to
search
clause.
but
even
if
we're
wrong
in
that,
and
even
if
there
should
be
some
type
of
distinctions
police
officers
should
be
required
to
make,
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
demand
that
a
police
officer
distinguish
between
the
types
of
authority
that
a
judge
gives
him
to
search,
between
a
search
warrant
and
a
consent
to
search
clause.
and
that's
particularly
true
in
this
case,
where
there
had
been...
a
substantial
number
of
years
had
intervened,
showing
that
this
type
of
condition
was
lawful.
now
respondents
and
amici
have
argued
that
the
reasonable
mistake
exception
should
not
apply
to
this
type
of
authority
for
several
reasons.
we
believe
those
contentions
are
unpersuasive.
respondent
and
amici
first
argue
that
the
decision
in
leon
rested
on
the
proposition
of
encouraging
the
police
officers
to
secure
warrants.
in
our
view,
that
misreads
the
decision.
the
decision
in
leon,
we
believe,
rested
on
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
different
contexts,
and
not
on
the
question
whether
or
not
the
police
should
be
required
to
resort
to
warrants,
because
that's
a
question
of
substantive
fourth
amendment
law.
respondent
argues
that
it's
too
difficult
to
determine
whether
a
police
officer
acted
in
good
faith
in
this
context,
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
good
faith
exception
should
apply.
and
we
believe
he's
greatly
overstated
the
difficulty.
the
orders
are
presumptively
valid,
and
a
police
officer
can
be
required
to
know
of
any
intervening
developments
in
the
law.
in
this
case
there
were
none.
the
decision
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
to
rule
that
respondent
was
not
on
probation
from
the
outset
was
handed
down
after
the
search
in
this
case;
and
therefore,
no
member
of
the
search
team
can
reasonably
be
deemed
to
have
been
aware
of
it.
respondent
and
amici
also
argue
that
there
are
already
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
that
authorizes
reasonable
police
conduct.
in
our
view,
that
misfocuses
the
inquiry.
if
as
we
believe
leon
rested
on
a
deterrent
rationale,
then
a
police
officer
will
not
be
deterred
from
engaging
in
objectively
reasonable
conduct,
with
or
without
a
warrant.
if
that's
true,
the
fact
that
there
are
types
of
warrantless
police
actions
that
are
themselves
lawful
does
not
mean
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
an
effective
deterrent
in
other
types
of
circumstances.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
true.
they
had
a
law
enforcement
there.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
there's
no
reason
for
those
facts,
for
her
to
have
assumed
that
the
february
27
order
was
invalid.
it
was
a
purely
legal
hearing.
the
prosecutor
introduced
no
facts
to
support
her
motion.
she
introduced
none
at
the
hearing.
respondent's
counsel
said...
did
not
say
that
any
factual
development
was
necessary.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i
think
he
also
objects
to
the--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
believe
so.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
it's
a
purely
legal
hearing
on
a
stay;
the
same
type
of
hearing
that
could
take
place
in
an
appellate
court.
if
the
prosecutor
had
appealed
a
trial
court
order
to
an
appellate
court,
the
defendant
would
not
have
the
right
to
be
present.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
it's
our
view
that
the
record
and
the
state
law
makes
it
clear
that
he
consented
at
the
time
the
order
was
originally
entered
november
14.
the
judge
told
him
about
the
conditions.
he
didn't
object
to
those.
he
objected
only
going
to
jail
and
having
to
get
rid
of
one
of
his
guns.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
next
question
then
is
whether
the
officers
had
an
objectively
reasonable
belief
that
the
order
entered
was
valid
and
therefore
authorized
the
search.
you
would
move
on
to
the
second
question.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
november
14
order
was
stayed
in
its
entirety.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
and
we
have
not
challenged
that.
so
that
it's
correct
to
look
to
the
february
27
order.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
what
they
said
was--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
added
that
type
of
scienter
inquiry
into
the
analysis.
and
we
think
it's
unsupported
in
the
record,
and
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
the
district
court's
finding.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
you
get
to
that
second
question.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
lawyer.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
the
same
way
as
if
one
police
officer
knew
of
that
problem.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
reasonable.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
may
time.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
first
thing
i'd
like
to
say
is,
there
plainly
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
probation
search
was
related
to
probation.
there'd
been
gunfire
reported
on
the
respondent's
neighborhood.
in
the
britton
case
we
cited
in
our
brief
is
virtually
on
all
fours
with
this
type
of
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
gunfire
was
at
a
time
when
the
prosecutor
could
have
reasonably
believed
that
he
was
on
probation.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
but
that's
just
a
recasting
of
their
stale
evidence
argument.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
she
had...
which...
as
part
of
that,
she
had
a
reasonable
belief
that
he
still
had
firearms.
to
that
extent,
i
think
under
either
interpretation
she
would
have
a
reasonable
belief.
thank
you
very
much.
