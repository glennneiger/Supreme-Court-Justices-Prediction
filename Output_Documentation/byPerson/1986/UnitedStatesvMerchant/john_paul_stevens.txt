justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
larkin,
before
you
leave
the
notice
aspect
of
the
case,
let's
assume
that
you're
dead
right,
that
the
order
is
not
a
nullity.
but
rather,
perhaps,
one
could
ask,
what
is
the
effective
date
of
the
order,
insofar
as
it
imposes
conditions
of
probation
on
the
defendant?
and
i
understood
you...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
this
right...
that
if
the
probation
had,
say,
two
conditions
in
it,
one,
may
not
associate
with
certain
undesirable
characters,
and
they
name
them,
and
two,
you
have
to
consent
to
a
search.
and
if
he
didn't
get
actual
notice
of
the
order,
just
in
the
interval
between
the
friday
and
the
tuesday
when
they
came
out,
and
in
the
meantime
had
associated
with
people
that
he
was
forbidden
to
associate
by
terms
of
the
order,
i
think
you
have
said
he
could
not
have
his
probation
revoked
because
he
wouldn't
have
known
that
that
was
in
effect
yet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
aren't
you
saying
that
the...
that
the...
insofar
as
the
conditions
of
the
probation
affect
his
personal
conduct,
he's
entitled
to
notice
of
that
before
the
order
becomes
effective
as
to
him?
and
if
so,
how
do
you
distinguish
between
associating
with
other
people
and
taking
care
of
the
privacy
of
his
home
and
rearranging
his
affairs
if
he
knows
somebody
might
bust
in
without
a
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
you've
in
effect
said
it
did
not
become
effective,
as
to
conditions
which
might
require
affirmative
conduct
on
his
part,
until
he
had
notice
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
couldn't
you
revoke
it
if
it
was
effective?
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
that.
if
the
order
is
effective
to
govern
his
conduct,
and
he
violates
a
term
of
the
probation,
you
can
revoke
his
probation.
now
why
is
it
effective
for
some
purposes
and
not
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
wouldn't
it
also
be
effective
as
to
saying
you
can't
associate
with
mr.
x?
i
don't
understand
how
it
can
be
partially
effective
and
not
totally
effective.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
important
to
know
about
some
but
not
others?
he's
supposed
to
know
that
he
can't
associate
with
someone,
but
he's
not
supposed
to
know
that
someone
can
walk
into
his
living
room?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
hasn't,
because
the
man
has
consented
to
it,
under
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
hasn't
he
also
consented
not
to
associate
with
mr.
x?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he's
going
to
go
to
jail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say
he
had
private
things
there
he
didn't
want
the
officers
to
see.
you
wouldn't
consider
that
a
penalty
to
just
have
to
expose
to
view
things
he
considered
private.
that's
not
a
penalty?
that's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
there
are
adverse
consequences
in
an
unwarranted
search?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
just
assuming
he
doesn't
go
to
jail
for
it,
just,
you
go
into
his
living
room
when
he
doesn't
expect
anybody
to
walk
in?
why
is
that
different?
well,
i
guess
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
also,
to
what
extent
is
the
order
effective.
and
justice
scalia
suggests
it's
effective
to
the
extent
it
affects
his
primary
conduct.
and
i
suppose
that
means
that
a
person
is
not...
his
primary
conduct
is
unaffected
by
knowledge
that
his
home
can
be
entered
at
anytime
by
a
law
enforcement
officer.
i
question...
i
wonder
if
that's
a
valid
distinction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
larkin,
before
you
sit
down,
on
the
good
faith
issue,
is
the
test...
because
there
was
a
lawyer
who
was
involved
in
the
decision
to
make
the
search,
as
i
understand...
is
the
test...
and
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
lawyer
knew
that
the...
a,
that
there
was
no
actual
notice
to
the
defendant,
and
b,
that
the
court
of
appeals
might
at
least
think
there's
a
question
about
whether,
given
the
absence
of
notice
to
the
defendant,
the
search
would
be
proper.
but
the
police
officers
didn't
realize
that.
the
police
officers
just
rely
on
the
face
of
the
order.
do
we
test
it
by
the
judgment
of
the
lawyer,
or
by
the
judgment
of
the
police
officers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
question
then
is
whether
a
lawyer,
having
knowledge
that
there
wasn't
actual
notice
to
the
defendant,
might
have
thought
there
was
a
question
about
the
validity
of
the
search?
