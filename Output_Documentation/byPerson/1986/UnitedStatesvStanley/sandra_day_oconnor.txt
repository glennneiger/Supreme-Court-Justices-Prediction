justice
o'connor
before
we
leave
that
point,
mr.
wright,
i
guess
the
respondent
argues
that,
on
this
same
order
you
refer
us
to,
in
the
next
paragraph
it
says,
"further
ordered
that
the
clerk
enter
final
judgment
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
"
and
the
clerk
never
did.
justice
o'connor
that
is
in
the
appendix
also?
justice
o'connor
yes.
you
didn't
read
it
all.
that
is...
the
motion
is
granted.
then
it
says,
"the
clerk
to
enter
final
judgment
in
favor
of
the
u.s..
"
is
that
right?
maybe
i
am
reading
the
wrong
thing.
