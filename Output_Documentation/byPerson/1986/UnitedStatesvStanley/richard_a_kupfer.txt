mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
if
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
had
volunteered
for
lsd
drug
testing
on
behalf
of
the
army,
the
government
would
have
a
much
stronger
argument
that
this
was
something
that
was
incident
to
his
military
service,
but
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
plaintiff
did
not
volunteer
for
lsd
drug
testing
nor
was
he
under
orders
to
arrive
at
edgewood
arsenal
for
lsd
drug
testing,
nor
was
he
even
on
his
regular
duty
status
for
that
one-month
period
of
time
that
he
was
up
at
edgewood
arsenal.
with
the
courts
indulgence,
what
i
would
like
to
do
if
i
could
is
spend
the
first
few
minutes
just
discussing
some
of
the
unique
facts
of
this
particular
case
which
i
think
make
this
case
unlike
any
other
feres
type
of
case
which
has
been
before
this
court
previously.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
he
did
not
volunteer
for
lsd
drug
testing.
he
did
not.
the
plaintiff
volunteered
in
this
case
for
a
program
that
was
ostensibly
supposed
to
test
and
develop
gas
masks
and
protective
clothing.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
program.
that
was
the
lure
to
attract
mr.
stanley
up
to
edgewood
arsenal.
there
was
no
compulsion
for
him
to
go
up
there.
when
he
did
go
up
there
they
went
through
the
charade
of
having
him
test
gas
masks
and
protective
clothing,
but
the
real
purpose
of
this
program
was
to
unwittingly
subject
the
plaintiff
to
lsd
which
was
secretly
added
to
his
drinking
water
while
he
was
up
at
edgewood
arsenal.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
we
have
not
alleged
that
others
in
the
same
program
received
it.
we
just
allege
that
he
alone
received
it.
at
any
time
that
he
desired
he
could
leave
the
testing
laboratories.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
we
just
alleged...
we
did
not
make
allegations
that
other
soldiers
also
received
it,
which
was
justice
rehnquist's
question.
our
allegations
go
entirely
to
this
one
claim.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
i
am
not
saying
that
he
was
the
only
person
who
received
it.
i
am
just
saying
that
we
have
not
made
any
allegations
in
our
complaint
that
go
outside
the
facts
of
mr.
stanley's
situation
up
at
edgewood
arsenal.
at
any
time
he
desired
he
could
leave
that
program.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
what
his
technical
duty
status
was
while
he
was
up
at
edgewood
arsenal.
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
disciplinary
relationship
between
the
plaintiff--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--there
is
no
evidence
what
he
was
on.
there
is
no...
i
don't
believe
the
record
indicates--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--no,
he
went
up
there
to
volunteer
for
a
program
that
was
misrepresented
to
him.
he
went
up
to
volunteer
for
a
program--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--well,
whether
or
not
that
was
an
army
program
is
also
in
dispute
because
the
complaint
alleges
otherwise,
okay.
the
complaint
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--there
was
a
notice
that
was
posted
at
his
army
barracks--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--we
are
not.
we
are
not
suing
the
army.
we
are
suing
the
united
states,
and
we
are
suing
civilian
officers.
we
are
suing
doctors
who
are
civilians.
we
are
suing
the
state
university
which
is
alleged
to
have
been
an
independent
contractor.
we
are
suing
individuals
who
we
say
were
employed
by
federal
civilian
agencies
such
as
but
not
limited
to
the
cia
that
we
say
implemented
it
and
was
part
of
this
program.
we
are
not
suing
army
officers
as
part
of
this
program,
which
is
again
one
of
those
unique
facts
that
i
started
out
saying
which
i
think
distinguishes
this
from--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--the
complaint
alleges
that
he
was
no
longer...
he
was
no
longer
on
his
active
duty
service
for
the
time
he
was
up
there,
that
he
returned
back
to
his
active
duties
after
the
month.
i
don't
believe
there
is
anything
in
the
record
as
to
what
his
duty
status
was
when
he
was
up
here.
that
is
a
question
mark,
frankly.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
he
was
still
in
the
army,
yes.
now,
mr.
wright
has
pointed
out
in
his
brief
that
while
he
was
still
receiving
military
pay
while
he
was
up
there
for
that
one
month,
but
a
soldier
who
is
on
furlough
receives
military
pay
for
one
month
also.
this
court
has
held
in
the
brooks
case
that
a
soldier
on
furlough
is
allowed
to
sue
the
government
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
negligence.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
given
false
information
as
to
the
program.
the
dosage
of
lsd
that
he
received
is
unknown
at
this
point.
it
was
apparently
substantial,
judging
from
his
reactions
to
it.
he
experienced
the
usual
hallucinations
that
a
person
experiences,
but
he
had
no
idea
what
was
happening
to
him.
for
that
one
month
period
of
time
nobody
told
him
what
was
happening
to
him.
when
he
left
the
army
base
nobody
debriefed
him.
he
went
back
to
his
active
duty
services.
he
continued
to
have
flashback
recurrences
on
his
active
duty
services.
he
went
for
months
and
years
doubting
his
own
sanity
but
he
was
afraid
to
say
anything
to
anybody
for
fear
that
he
would
be
discharged
from
the
military
service.
the
complaint
alleges
that...
and
i
think
the
damages
are
important
in
this
case
because
of
the
alternative
remedy
that
the
government
alleges,
which
is
why
i
am
getting
into
the
damages.
the
complaint
alleges
that
on
one
occasion
in
fact
he
even
awoke
late
at
night
in
a
rage
without
any
provocation,
beat
up
his
wife,
and
beat
up
his
children,
and
threw
the
tv
through
the
wall
and
went
back
to
sleep
and
woke
up
again
the
next
morning
and
had
no
recall
of
that
event.
the
complaint
also
alleges
that
as
a
result
of
the
lsd
testing
he
was
unable
to
officially
perform
his
duties
in
the
military.
he
would
be
absent
without
leave
for
period
of
time
and
would
suddenly
show
up,
and
when
he
was
questioned
as
to
his
whereabouts
he
couldn't,
explain
his
whereabouts,
and
he
was
eventually
reduced
in
rank
in
the
military
because
of
inefficiency.
i
should
mention
that
up
until
the
drug
testing
he
was
in
the
army
for
about
seven
years
and
had
an
unblemished
record
in
the
army,
and
he
had
intended
to
make
the
military
his
career.
it
was
not
until
seven
years
after
he
retired
from
military
service,
which
is
18
years
after
the
drug
testing,
that
he
finally
got
a
letter
from
walter
reed
medical
center
telling
him
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
an
unwitting
lsd
subject
back
in
the
late
1950s,
and
the
purpose
of
that
letter
was
to
solicit
him
to
go
back
up
to
walter
reed
now
to
do
follow-up
studies
of
the
long-range
effects
of
lsd.
when
he
learned
that
he
filed
an
administrative
claims
with
the
united
states
army
claims
service.
those
administrative
claims
were
denied
by
the
claims
service
with
the
statement
that
there
is
no
appropriation
available
to
the
army
to
pay
this
kind
of
a
claim,
and
the
army
told
him,
if
you
are
dissatisfied
with
this
determination
you
have
six
months
to
file
a
lawsuit
in
federal
district
court,
which
is
what
he
did.
they
did
not
tell
him
go
seek
veterans'
benefits.
they
told
him
to
file
a
lawsuit
in
federal
court.
now,
we
have
alleged,
to
answer
the
question
asked
earlier--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--he
made
his
claim
with
the
army
claims
service.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
initially--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--well,
we
are
alleging
that
the
program
was...
certainly
the
army
was
involved
in
the
program.
we
are
claiming
the
program
was
actually
implemented
by
nonmilitary
defendants.
the
case
is
coming
up
to
appeal
just
on
the
pleadings
because
there
has
been...
this
is
not
a
summary
judgment.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record.
the
case
got
to
the
eleventh
circuit
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
based
on
the
allegation--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--everything
i
am
telling
you
is
either
in
materials
that
were
filed
with
the
district
court
when
there
was
an
earlier
summary
judgment
motion
years
ago,
there
were
some
documentary
materials
filed
with
this
court,
and
what
i
am
telling
you
also
comes
out
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
so
it
is
in
the
record.
i
have
indicated
who
we
are
suing
in
this
case.
we
are
not...
the
complaint
itself
does
not
purport
to
sue
superior
military
officers
within
the
disciplinary
context
that
this
court
was
speaking
about
in
the
chappell
versus
wallace
case
and
on
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
as
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
should
be
deemed
to
be
true.
the
cia's
own
records
about
their
involvement
in
drug
testing
programs
in
general
back
in
the
fifties
were
unfortunately
destroyed
back
in
1973
pursuant
to
orders
of
the
director
of
the
cia
who
is
also
a
defendant
in
this
lawsuit,
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
engage
in
discovery
to
any
great
extent
in
this
case
because
the
district
judge
entered
several
orders
protecting
the
government
from
discovery
until
we
disposed
of
the
feres
issue.
what
we
are
asking
at
this
point
is
the
opportunity
to
go
back
to
district
court
and
to
prove
the
allegations
that
we
are
making
in
our
complaint.
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
falls
outside
of
the
typical
feres
factual
paradigm
is
the
phrase
that
was
used
by
the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case,
and
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
claim
that
would
require
the
judicial
involvement
into
a
sensitive
military
issues
at
the
expense
of
military
discipline.
the
very
worst
fact
that
we
have
to
deal
with
in
this
case
is
that
this
program,
whoever
implemented
the
program,
occurred
on
an
army
base,
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
edgewood
arsenal
is
an
army
base.
but
this
court
held
in
the
shearer
case
that
the
site
of
the
incident
is
not
nearly
as
important
as
whether
the
case,
taking
the
case
in
a
complete
perspective,
whether
that
case
requires
a
civilian
court
to
second
guess
the
wisdom
of
military
decisions,
and
this
court
said
that
feres
today
is
best
explained
by
the
military
discipline
rationale,
and
that
can't
be
reduced
to
just
a
few
bright
lines
rules
as
to
whether
an
incident
occurred
on
an
army
base
or
off
of
an
army
case.
now,
the
lower
courts
in
this
case,
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
have
held
that
this
is
clearly
not
just
your
garden
variety
feres
type
of
case.
the
facts
of
this
case
read
like
they
have
been
lifted
out
of
a
novel
by
george
orwell
where
even
a
person's
own
creative
thought
process
is
tinkered
with
by
the
government,
and
altered,
and
controlled
by
the
government,
and
we
believe
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
if
it
guarantees
anything
surely
guarantees
the
right
of
all
americans
to
control
their
own
mind
and
to
control
their
own
intellectual
thought
process
and
the
content
of
their
own
bloodstream.
that
is
where
these
constitutional
claims
come
from.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
that
would
have
made
a
substantial
amount
of
difference
because
then
you
wouldn't
have
a
violation
of
the
nuremberg
code,
because
you
wouldn't
have
an
unwitting
test
subject.
you
would
have
a
soldier
who
was
then
volunteering
for
what
he
understands
to
be
a
program
to
test
lsd
drugs.
that
would
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
in
a
case
like
this,
yes.
again,
it
is
undisputed,
i
believe
it
is
undisputed--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--well,
the
army
says
that
back
in
the
early
or
late
fifties
that
they
themselves
did
not
know
what
it
would
do
to
him.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
in
fact,
they
say
they
thought
that
it
would
just
be
temporary,
the
effects
of
it.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
then,
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
negligence
cause
of
action,
i
am
not
sure
there
would
be
a
constitutional
cause
of
action.
that
is
the
point
because,
you
see--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--well,
on
the
tort
claims,
the
tort
claims
come
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
we
say
that
because
this
type
of
program
was
patently
illegal,
first
of
all...
the
nuremberg
code
prohibits
involuntary
human
experimentation.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
well,
it
has
been
adopted
by
the
chief
and
the
secretary
of
the
army
and
the
navy
and
the
air
force,
and
it
therefore
is
part
of
the
army's
own
regulations.
that
goes
to
the
question,
do
we
have
to
second
guess
the
wisdom
of
military
decisions?
the
military
itself
has
already
made
its
own
regulations
in
this
case,
not
only
through
the
nuremberg
code,
but
the
inspector
general
of
the
army
has
issued
a
report
on
these
drug
experiments
and
the
inspector
general
himself
has
found
that
this
program
was
completely
unauthorized
by
any
existing
army
regulations.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
we
also
think
as
one
additional--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--the
fact
that
it--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--it
doesn't
necessarily
avoid
it,
but
it
is
a
significant
factor
because
the
question
is
whether
or
not...
do
civil
courts
have
to
second
guess
military
decisions?
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
the
army
was...
we
are
saying
that
it
was
not
initially
implemented
by
the
army.
it
did
happen
on
an
army
base.
there
were
army
officers
there.
there
were
civilian
officers
there.
the
inspector
general
himself
has
found
that
these--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--the
inspector
general
felt
that
the
programs
were...
that
this
was
an
unauthorized
program,
that
the
army
was
involved.
we
don't
know--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--we
don't
know.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
well,
the
regulations
of
the
army
should
at
the
very
least
govern
the
army
in
whatever
program
the
army,
if
it
is
going
to
have
army
personnel
involved
in
a
program,
even
if
the
personnel
is
implemented
by
a
separate
branch
of
the
government
it
would
seem
that
the
army
should
follow
its
own
regulations.
we
have
alleged
that
this
does
violate
the
army's
own
regulations.
we
have
also
alleged
one
other
important--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--why
did
it?
because
it
involved
unwitting
human
experimentation
which
violates
the
nuremberg
code
and
because
there
were
no
regulations
according
to
the
inspector
general
which
even
authorized
this
type
of
a
program
for
the
army.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
involuntary
human
experiments.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
the
government...
we
think
the
government
is
responsible
when
government
agents
violate
within
the
course
of
their
employment
for
the
government
violate
constitutional
rights
of
servicemen
or
civilians,
that
the
government
is
responsible
if
the
case
itself
does
not
fall
within
the
typical
feres
factual
paradigm,
one
military
officer
suing
another
military
officer
for
negligence
within
the
course
of--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--we
think
that
the
government
is
responsible
for
that.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
particularly
when
the
government...
well,
if
the
soldier--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--if
the
government...
if
the
government--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--well,
then,
your
hypothetical
assumes
that
he
was
told
that
it
is
lsd.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
that
the
serviceman
was
told
that
it
was
lsd
he
was
being
shot
with?
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
okay,
under
those
circumstances
i
don't
know
if
there
is
a
tort
claim,
unless
it
maybe
would
be
failure
to
warn--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--perhaps
a
failure
to
warn
of
what
the
effects
of
the
lsd--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--we
allege
that
it
was
not
authorized,
in
fact,
the
program.
we
also
allege
that
the
government,
that
within
the
context
of
the
feres
doctrine,
there
is
room
for
equitable
principles,
and
that
there
is
room
for
an
estoppel
against
the
government
when
the
government
is
engaged
in
this
type
of
unconscionable
conduct
and
when
a
military
serviceman
detrimentally
relies
upon
the
government
telling
him
that
he
is
volunteering
for
one
kind
of
a
program
all
the
while
just
intending
to
secretly
mix
lsd
with
his
drinking
water
under
these
limited
circumstances,
that
the
government
should
be
held
to
be
estopped
to
even
argue
that
this
was
incident
to
military
service.
now,
this
court
has
never
intimated,
i
don't
believe,
in
any
feres
case,
that
equitable
estoppel
cannot
apply.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
the
last
case
was
a
case
where
actually
the
majority
left
the
question
open
as
to--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--this
court
has
never
held...
this
court
has
never
held--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--that's
true,
but
in
heckler
versus
community
health
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court
held
that
there
may
be
a
case
some
day
where
the
public
interest
would
warrant
an
estoppel
against
the
government.
this
court--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--i
say
this
is
it.
i
say
this
is
it,
and
i
think
that
by
finding
an
estoppel
in
this
case,
number
one,
you
would
not
be
undermining
the
viability
of
the
feres
doctrine
in
general
because
this
is
a
very
limited
case.
you
would
not
be
opening
up
a
floodgate
for
other
litigants,
only
those
litigants
that
are
similarly
situation
to
mr.
stanley,
and
if
this
program
had
been
what
it
was
described
to
be,
if
it
had
been
really
a
program
to
test
gas
masks
and
protective
clothing,
and
if
mr.
stanley
had
been
injured
inhaling
fumes
from
a
gas
mask,
then
again
the
government
would
have
a
much
better
argument
that
this
was
incident
to
his
military
service,
this
is
what
he
volunteered
for,
but
when
we
say
that
when
the
government
intentionally
misleads
its
own
servicemen
to
volunteer
for
one
kind
of
a
program
and
that
is
not
the
program
that
he
is
really
volunteering
for,
that
the
government
should
be
estopped
to
argue
that
this
is
something
that
is
incident
to
his
military
service.
at
any
rate,
we
think
the
circumstances
of
this
case
do
not
involve
the
type
of
close
military
judgment
calls
that
the
feres
doctrine
was
really
designed
to
insulate
from
review,
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
prosecution
of
this
claim
would
undermine
the
disciplinary
structure
of
the
military
to
allow
it
to
proceed.
as
far
as
the
bivens
action,
even
if
the
feres
doctrine
does
preclude
our
claim
against
the
government
it
would
not
necessarily
preclude
the
constitutional
claim
against
the
individual
defendants.
the
government
relies
upon
chappell
versus
wallace.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
yes,
this
is
the...
i
am
getting
to
the
bivens
argument
now,
your
honor.
this
case
is
much
different
than
the
chappell
or
chappell
case.
the
chappell
case
involved
soldiers
who
were
clearly
superior
military
officers
who
were
on
board
a
navy
combat
vessel
along
with
the
plaintiffs,
and
they
were
being
sued
specifically
for
making
certain
command
decisions
and
taking
certain
disciplinary
actions
that
were
alleged
to
be
racially
motivated.
now,
those
facts
are
radically
different
from
the
facts
that
we
have
involved
in
this
case,
and
this
court
in
chappell
specifically
cautioned
that
the
opinion
should
not
be
read
to
mean
that
military
personnel
are
barred
from
seeking
all
redress
in
the
civil
courts
for
all
kinds
of
constitutional
violations
that
they
may
suffer
in
the
course
of
military
service.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
chappell
case
would
lead
the
court
to
believe
that
was
really
intended
to
be
limited
to
the
facts
that
were
before
this
court
in
that
case.
now,
the
government
here
says
that
this
case
could
involve
an
inquiry
somehow
into
military
decisionmaking
somewhere
along
the
line,
maybe
there
was
some
military
decisionmaking
involved
here,
but
if
you
accept
that,
if
that
alone
precludes
a
bivens
action,
then
what
you
are
saying
is
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
wrongful
act
is
perpetrated
on
an
active
duty
serviceman,
the
individual
defendants
can
always
remain
immune
simply
by
asserting
that
their
act
was
the
result
of
military
decisionmaking.
boom,
they
are
immune.
and
to
accept
the
government's--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--it
strikes
me
as--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--i
am
just...
i
am
taking
the
view
that
a--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--the
act?
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
i
think
if
it
involves
a
potential
estoppel
situation
it
should.
i
think
that
is
where
you
should
draw
the
line.
there
has
to
be...
unless
you
draw
the
line
no
place
then
surely...
then
the
situation
that
you
are
left
with
is
that
there
is
no,
absolutely
no
limit
to
the
immunity
doctrine
without
an
arbitrary
line
some
place,
and
a
line
doesn't
have
to
be
so
arbitrary,
i
think,
when
you
have
facts
like
this.
i
think
when
federal
officers
willfully
and
knowingly
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
active
duty
servicemen,
to
say
that
there
is
absolute
immunity
in
that
type
of
a
situation,
number
one,
that
is
not
going
to
promote
discipline
in
the
military.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
feres
doctrine
is
to
promote
discipline.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
i
think
that
there
could
be
a
potential
bivens
action.
if
an
officer,
let's
say
an
officer
kills
an
active
duty
serviceman.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
whether
there
is
a
federal
tort
claims
act
because
of
certain
exclusions
for
some
intentional
torts
in
assault
and
battery
is
hard
to
say.
whether
there
should
be--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--i
don't
think
the
feres
doctrine
should
because--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--i
don't
know
that
there
has
been
a
case
of
intentional
beating
up
of
an
inferior
officer
to
test
that,
but
i
do
think
this.
i
think
that
when
you
consider
the
purpose
of
the
feres
doctrine,
which
is
to
maintain
discipline,
okay,
and
you
say
that
superior
officers
can
do
anything
they
want
to
active
duty
servicemen,
and
they
need
never
fear
of
being
held
accountable
for
damages
in
the
civil
justice
system,
that
is
not
going
to
promote
discipline
in
the
military.
that
is
going
to
create
chaos.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
no,
i
think
the
feres
doctrine
should
apply
in
cases
where
the
facts
of
the
case
are
such
that
if
you
allow
that
particular
type
of
case,
if
it
falls
outside
a
typical
feres
situation,
if
you
allow
that
kind
of
case
to
go
into
the
civil
justice
system,
then
it
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
discipline
in
the
services.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
if
you
allow--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--i
think
if
you
allow
those
kind
of
claims
to
go
forward
i
don't
think
it
will
disrupt
discipline.
in
fact,
i
think
it
will
promote
discipline
because
then
inferior
servicemen,
enlisted
men
can
then
obey
military
orders
without
any
fear
that
there
is
going
to
be
some
kind
of
undetected
harm
that
is
going
to
befall
them,
like
swallowing
lsd.
i
think
you
have
got
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
think
you
have
to
consider
discipline
not
only
at
the
level
of
the
enlisted
man,
but
i
think
you
need
to
consider
discipline
at
the
higher
echelon
levels
of
the
government
as
well.
the
government's
interpretation,
strict
interpretation
of
the
chappell
doctrine
would
also
mean
that
an
american
servicemen
like
mr.
stanley,
a
sergeant
in
the
army,
would
be
actually
reduced
to
a
position
inferior,
even
to
a
convicted
and
incarcerated
federal
prisoner
who
is
allowed
to
bring
an
ftca
action
and
a
bivens
action
against
prison
officials.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
limit
it
to
medical
malpractice
cases?
i
think
congress
is
trying
to
open
it
up
for
medical
malpractice
cases,
in
fact,
but
i
think
that
feres
should
be
limited
to
those
cases
where
the
rationale
of
the
doctrine
applies.
that
is
the
cases
that
it
should
be
limited
to.
it
should
be
limited
to
those
cases
where
the
rationale
of
the
doctrine
applies.
veterans'
benefits
were
mentioned
briefly
as
being
an--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--it
applies
in
most
negligence
cases.
yes.
i
don't
think
it
applies
at
all
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
i
don't
think
it--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--i
have
trouble
realizing
how
a
medical
malpractice
case--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--where
it
should
apply
most
often
is
in
cases
where
a
soldier
is
suing
a
superior
officer
for
orders
that
were
given,
or
like
in
the
chappell
case,
for
giving
them
poor
performance
evaluations
and
for
keeping
them
from
being
promoted
within
the
navy
and
for
command
decisions
in
the
military
services,
surely
it
is
clear
in
those
cases
that
the
military
courts
are
the
proper
forum
to
hear
those
kind
of
cases,
but
when
you
have
a
fact
situation
which
involves
widespread
egregious
conduct...
the
government
admits,
they
admit
to
at
least
a
thousand
servicemen
that
they
did
this
to.
they
have
admitted
this
in
their
brief.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
there
is
a
stronger
argument
for
applying
the
feres
doctrine
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
well,
because
then
if
upper
level
servicemen
had
to
be
afraid
all
the
time
of
any
negligent
acts
that
they
might
take,
that
they
might
be
hauled
into
a
civil
court,
they
would
be
afraid
to
do
anything.
they
would
have
such
a
chilling
effect
on
higher
level
servicemen
that
certain
negligence
cases
it
does
comport
with
the
rationale
of
feres,
but
an
intentional
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
if
you
are
taking
the
feres
doctrine
and
you--
mr.
richard
a.
kupfer
--well,
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
artful
pleading
in
a
case
like
this.
we...
this
obviously
he
was
given
lsd.
nobody
accidentally
dropped
lsd
in
his
drinking
water.
he
was
intentionally
given
lsd.
and
according
to
the...
and
he
was
intentionally
denied
the
knowledge
that
he
was
given
lsd.
i
guess
artful
pleading
cases
would
have
to
be
separated
from
the
true
intentional
tort
cases
or
intentional
constitutional
violation
cases.
but
i
think
that
when
you
have
a
situation
like
this
where
there
also
is
no
adequate
remedy
by
veterans'
benefits...
if
i
could
just
one
spend
one
moment
on
that,
the
government
has
indicated
that
they
think
that
veterans'
benefits
in
this
case
would
be
an
adequate
alternative
remedy,
and
therefore
that
is
another
reason
why
he
shouldn't
be
able
to
sue.
you
need...
it
is
necessary
to
consider
the
type
of
injury
that
has
been
done
here.
mr.
stanley
alleges
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
some
of
his
most
basic
constitutional
rights,
including
the
right
to
control
his
own
mind
and
his
own
behavior
and
the
right
to
control
his
own
intellectual
thought
process.
he
suffered
mental
anguish
for
all
the
years
that
he
thought
he
was
going
crazy.
he
suffered
the
disruption
of
his
army
career.
his
family
and
marriage
has
been
dissolved
and
broken
down.
there
are
no
veterans'
benefits
that
can
compensate
for
these
kinds
of
injuries.
veterans'
benefits
will
also
not
serve
a
deterrent
purpose,
which
is
one
of
the
most
important
purposes
behind
the
bivens
action,
is
to
discourage
this
type
of
shocking
abuse
of
power
by
federal
officials.
veterans'
benefits
do
not
do
that.
at
this
stage
it
is
almost
30
years
after
those
1958
drug
experiments.
about
the
only
thing
that
veterans'
benefits
could
do
for
mr.
stanley
now
maybe
is
pay
for
any
future
psychiatric
care
that
he
might
need,
but
he
is
not
having
flashbacks
any
more.
that
will
be
nil.
veterans'
benefits
will
not
do
anything
for
him.
in
the
chappell
case
this
court
found
that
the
administrative
remedies
would
be
adequate
again.
in
that
case
those
plaintiffs
were
saying
that
they
were
discriminated
against
and
this
court
found
that
they
could
administratively
receive
pay
increases
and
retroactive
pay
increase
and
promotions
and
they
could
receive
everything
administratively
that
they
were
asking
for
in
the
civil
lawsuit.
you
also
said
on
the
same
day
that
chappell
was
decided
in
bush
versus
lucas
that
before
an
alternative
remedy
is
considered
to
be
a
special
factor
militating
against
allowing
a
bivens
action,
it
should
at
least
provide
meaningful
remedies
for
a
plaintiff,
meaningful
remedies.
we
have
no
meaningful
remedies
provided
in
this
case.
the
va,
the
veterans
benefits
act
is
not...
was
never
meant
by
congress
to
be
an
exclusive
remedy.
there
is
no
exclusive
remedy
provision.
in
fact,
that
act
expressly
recognizes
the
possibility
of
double
recovery
because
there
is
a
provision
in
the
veterans'
act
which
provides
a
method
for
offsetting
cumulative
recoveries,
and
this
court
held
in
the
brooks
case
and
the
brown
case
that
a
veteran
who
receives
va
benefits
is
still
not
necessarily
precluded
from
suing.
one
important
point
in
conclusion
also
is
that
in
a
bivens
action
defendants
are
always
entitled
to
raise
a
qualified
immunity.
if
they
say
they
acted
in
good
faith
and
if
they
reasonably
believed
their
conduct
to
be
lawful,
just
like
in
a
civil
rights
case,
then
they
are
immune,
but
if
this
court
gives
these
defendants
under
these
kind
of
facts
an
absolute
immunity
for
the
act
that
they
have
done,
no
matter...
the
message
will
be
that
no
matter
what
a
serviceman
does
to
a
lower
echelon
servicemen,
they
need
never
fear
of
being
brought
into
the
civil
justice
system,
and
i
think
that
after
all
the
progress
that
has
been
made
since
bivens
in
the
last
15
years
with
bivens
and
carlson
versus
green
and
united
states
versus
muniz
and
so
on,
to
recognize
an
absolute
immunity
from
liability
in
an
egregious
case
like
this
would
be
a
step
in
the
wrong
direction,
and
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision.
thank
you.
