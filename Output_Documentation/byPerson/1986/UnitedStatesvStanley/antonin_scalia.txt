justice
scalia
why
are
you
suing
the
army
if
you
are
not
sure
it
is
an
army
program?
i
thought
that
everyone
was
in
agreement
on
that.
justice
scalia
he
made
his
claim
with
the
army?
justice
scalia
so
he
thought
the
army
had
had
something
to
do
with
the
program
at
that
stage.
justice
scalia
you
are
now
telling
us
you
are
not
sure
that
it
was
even
the
army.
justice
scalia
i
assume
that
all
you
are
telling
us
is
in
the
record,
all
this
stuff
you
are
telling
us
is
not
all
extra-record
material.
justice
scalia
we
don't
really
know
that
this
was
in
violation
of
army
regulations
anyway,
because
you
have
told
us
that
we
don't
really
know
that
the
army
was
conducting
this.
and
if
the
army
wasn't
conducting
it,
i
presume
whoever
was
conducting
it
didn't
have
to
comply
with
army
regulations.
justice
scalia
army
regulations
apply
wherever
there
are
army
officers?
is
that
how
the
regulations
read?
i
assume
they
only
govern
the
activities
of
the
army.
justice
scalia
you
think
it
was
an
army
program,
don't
you?
justice
scalia
we
don't
know.
then
i
don't
know
what
you
are
talking
about
army
regulations
for.
justice
scalia
xxx
think
that
we
should
instead
hold
that
they
are
only
immune
no
matter
what
kind
of
wrongful
act
if
they
are
superior
officers?
i
mean,
does
that
strike
you
as
less
heinous?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
it
is...
either
line
sounds
pretty
arbitrary,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
the
gravity
of
the
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
where
you
draw
the
line,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
the
gravity
of
the
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you
draw
the
lines
with
superior
officers
or
not.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
think
the
feres
doctrine
says?
they
can
only
do
what,
moderately
bad
things?
justice
scalia
it
always
has
a
negative
impact.
you
don't
think
the
officer
is
going
to
admit
he
beat
him
up.
he
is
always
going
to
say,
i
didn't
beat
him
up.
i
mean,
you
are
talking
lawsuits
here,
not
acknowledged
guilt.
justice
scalia
and
it
is
going
to
get
into
the
civil
court
system
whether
you
are
suing
him
for
beating
him
up
or
whether
you
are
suing
him
for
calling
him
a
name.
in
either
event
it
is
going
to
disrupt
the
military
discipline,
isn't
it?
