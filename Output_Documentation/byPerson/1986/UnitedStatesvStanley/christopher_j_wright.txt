mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
1950s
the
army
conducted
tests
regarding
the
effects
of
lsd,
and
respondent
was
one
of
the
servicemen
who
participated
in
those
tests.
he
alleges
that
he
was
secretly
administered
lsd
on
four
occasions
in
february,
1958,
at
the
army's
chemical
warfare
laboratories
while
he
was
supposedly
testing
gas
masks,
and
that
he
did
not
know
he
had
been
given
lsd
until
1975,
when
the
army
asked
him
to
participate
in
a
follow-up
study.
he
alleges
that
he
sustained
mental
injuries
as
a
result
of
taking
the
drug.
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
is
noteworthy
because
it
shows
that
respondent
gave
up
on
both
of
his
claims
during
the
course
of
this
litigation.
respondent's
original
complaint,
which
alleged
a
claim
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court
on
the
basis
that
respondent
had
been
injured
incident
to
military
service
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
1981
held
that
that
claim
was
barred
by
this
court's
decision
in
feres.
respondent
filed
an
amended
complaint
that
contained
an
ftca
claim
and
a
bivens
claim
as
well,
but
the
district
court
dismissed
the
ftca
claim
and
granted
final
judgment
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
respondent
did
not
appeal
the
dismissal
of
the
ftca.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
printed
at
pages
54
to
55
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition.
the
judge
entered...
wrote
an
opinion
which
is
printed
at
pages
56
to
66,
and
then
he
entered
this
two-page
order
which
says
that
"there
is
no
just
reason
for
delay
in
expressly
directing
the
entry
of
judgment
in
favor
of
the
united
states
and
that
such
relief
is
hereby
granted.
"
and
i
would
like
to
note
that
"hereby
granted"
is
printed
in
all
capital
letters.
that
is
about
as
plain
a
final
judgment
under
rule
54b
as
there
can
be.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
contend
that
this
order
is
a
separate
document.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
that
there
should
not
merely
be
some
apparently
dispository
language
in
the
opinion,
as
there
is
in
the
opinion
that
is
printed
on
pages
56
to
66,
but
that
there
should
be
a
separate
order
that
complies
with
the
rule.
we
asked,
the
government
asked
the
district
court
to
enter
this
final
order
pursuant
to
rule
54b
dismissing
the
united
states,
and
the
district
court
did.
respondent
didn't
appeal
that
dismissal
as
he
was
required
to
do,
but
instead
filed
a
second
amended
complaint
which
is
the
live
complaint
in
this
case
and
which
is
printed
in
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
clerk
is
required
to
enter
a
final
judgment
on
the
docket
sheet,
and
we
printed
that
in
page
2
of
our
joint
appendix.
and
if
i
may
quote
from
it,
it
says
"motion
for
partial
final
judgment
by
defendant
usa
is
granted.
"
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
that
is
correct.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
more
to
be
done.
that
is
tracking
the
language
of
the
order
that
the
judge
entered.
the
judge
said
"final
judgment
is
hereby
granted.
"
"the
clerk
shall
enter
the
order.
"
the
clerk
then
said,
"final
judgment
is
granted,
and
repeated
that.
"
the
clerk
to
enter
final
judgment.
"there
was
never
any
dispute
that
final
judgment
was
entered.
"
"in
the
letter
that
counsel
for
respondent
wrote
to
the
district
court
after
this
court's
decision
in
chappell
v.
wallace
counsel
said.
"
you
entered
judgment
in
favor
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
a
few
months
ago.
"the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case
acknowledged
at
the
beginning
of
its
opinion
that
final
judgment
was
entered
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
"
"there
has
simply
never
been
any
real
doubt
about
that.
"
"and
in
the
face
of
a
statement
in
the
order
saying
final
judgment
in
favor
of
the
united
states
is
hereby
granted,
we
just
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
real
dispute
on
that.
"
"and
it
is
further
shown
that
respondent
understood
that
by
the
fact
that
he
filed
a
second
amended
complaint
that
contained
bivens
claims
but
no
ftca
claim.
"
then
this
court
issued
its
decision
in
chappell
v.
wallace
and
respondent
wrote
the
letter
to
the
district
court
that
we
reprinted
in
our
reply
brief
at
the
petition
stage
that
says
that
counsel
was
"ethically
compelled
to
cite
to
the
court
a
recent
supreme
court
decision
which
we
regret
to
say
is
apparently
dispositive
of
this
case.
"
the
district
court
refused
to
accept
that
concession,
although
it
did
certify
its
order
to
that
effect
for
interlocutory
appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
decision
and
then,
ignoring
the
fact
that
respondent
had
abandoned
his
ftca
claim,
resurrected
that
claim
as
well.
we
contend
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
dismissed
respondent's
bivens
claims
and
should
not
have
resurrected
the
ftca
claim
because
this
court's
decisions
in
feres
and
chappell
compelled
the
conclusion
that
servicemen
injured
incident
to
military
service
may
not
pursue
those
sorts
of
claims.
we
realize
that
under
the
result
that
we
contend
is
mandated
by
this
court's
decisions
respondent
is
barred
from
challenging
an
army
program
that
was
poorly
conducted
and
that
may
have
harmed
him,
but
respondent
is
not
without
a
remedy.
as
we
have
explained
in
our
briefs,
if
he
was
injured
as
a
result
of
this
program
he
may
obtain
veterans'
benefits,
and
the
army
is
not
vindicated
by
a
decision
holding
that
he
may
not
pursue
damage
actions.
the
senate
has
studied
the
army's
lsd
testing
program
and
issued
a
critical
report
concerning
that
program
that
included
instructions
to
the
army
as
to
how
to
conduct
future
chemical
weapons
tests.
concerning
the
final
judgment
entered
in
favor
of
the
ftca
claim
i
would
like
to
note
only
that
the
whole
point
of
rule
54b
is
to
resolve
a
case
as
to
certain
issues
or
as
to
certain
parties,
and
that
this
case
was
resolved
in
favor
of
the
united
states
when
respondent
decided
not
to
appeal
that
final
judgment.
in
addition
i
would
like
to
note
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
jurisdiction
in
this
case
was
based
on
its
acceptance
for
interlocutory
appeal
of
the
question
certified,
which
was
the
bivens
question,
and
the
ftca
question
was
clearly
beyond
the
scope
of
that
certified
question.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
there
are
such
decisions.
we
have
cited
a
number
of
them.
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
draw
precisely
the
line
as
to
where
the
certified
question
ends
and
other
matters
begin,
but
i
know
of
no
case
that
would
even
come
close
to
the
situation
here
where
it
is
an
order
as
to
another
party
on
another
claim.
we
do
not
know
of
any
case
that
would
allow
a
court
to
extend
its
jurisdiction
on
a
certified
question
under
these
facts.
finally
on
that
point
i
would
just
like
to
note
that
the
eleventh
circuit
did
not
even
appear
to
be
aware
that
there
was
a
jurisdictional
problem,
although
we
did
raise
that
in
our
rehearing
petition
that
they
denied.
in
any
event,
as
to
the
ftca
claim,
it
is
clear
that
that
claim
is
barred
by
feres
because
respondent
was
administered
lsd
incident
to
his
military
service.
in
its
1981
decision
in
this
case,
the
fifth
circuit
noted
that
in
1958
respondent
was
a
master
sergeant
in
the
army
who
had
volunteered
to
participate
in
an
official
army
chemical
warfare
program,
that
the
program
was
conducted
on
an
army
base
by
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
army,
that
respondent
received
military
pay
during
the
month
that
he
participated
in
the
program,
and
that
he
was
promised
a
letter
of
commendation
for
his
participation.
i
might
add
as
well
that
in
the
second
amended
complaint,
paragraph
11,
respondent
says
that
he
was
on
active
duty
during
that
month.
no
court
disagreed
with
the
conclusion
that
respondent
was
participating
in
this
program
incident
to
his
military
service,
not
even
the
eleventh
circuit.
it
instead
held
that
an
ftca
claim
is
not
necessarily
barred
because
the
injury
on
which
the
claim
is
based
occurred
incident
to
military
service.
we
argued
in
johnson,
the
ftca
case
involving
a
helicopter
crash
that
was
argued
in
this
court
in
february,
that
this
court
held
in
feres
shortly
after
the
ftca
was
enacted
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
torts
occurring
incident
to
military
service,
and
that
there
is
no
reason
to
revisit
that
construction
of
the
statute
which
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
alter
in
37
years.
i
will
not
repeat
that
argument
today
but
do
want
to
note
that
this
case
represents
a
significant
extension
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
erroneous
decision
in
johnson
which
distinguished
feres
on
the
basis
that
the
tort
feasor
there
was
a
civilian
air
traffic
controller
who
is
not
in
the
military
chain
of
command
but
was
instead
employed
by
the
department
of
transportation.
there
is
no
question
that
the
program
under
which
respondent
was
administered
lsd
was
an
army
program.
it
was
developed
and
conducted
by
the
army
intelligence
board
and
the
army's
chemical
warfare
laboratories
where
the
tests
were
conducted.
while
respondent
has
named
some
civilian
doctors
in
his
second
amended
complaint
they
were
obviously
working
for
the
army
in
this
case.
the
courts
below
also
erred
in
refusing
to
dismiss
respondent's
bivens
claim.
the
letter
that
counsel
for
respondent
sent
to
the
district
court
after
this
court
issued
its
decision
in
chappell
v.
wallace
explained
that
this
court
"held
that
the
same
principles
which
underlie
the
feres
doctrine
and
which
require
absolute
immunity
from
an
ftca
action
also
require
immunity
from
a
bivens
constitutional
action
against
federal
officers.
"
that
is
an
accurate
description
of
this
court's
holding.
except
for
the
courts
below,
all
of
the
other
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
the
question
have
understood
that
this
court
barred
servicemen
from
bringing
bivens
suits
against
their
superiors
and
did
not
authorize
any
case
by
case
inquiry
of
the
sort
mandated
by
the
court
below.
that
is
absolutely
clear
from
this
court's
opinion
in
chappell
which
reversed
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
that
did
not
authorize
the
plaintiff
to
bring
their
bivens
action
but
instead
remanded
the
case
for
application
of
certain
tests
similar
to
those
set
out
in
the
fifth
circuit's
mindes
v.
seaman
case
to
determine
whether
the
plaintiffs
there
could
proceed.
this
court
rejected
that
balancing
approach,
holding
instead
that
enlisted
military
personnel
may
not
maintain
a
suit
to
recover
damages
from
a
superior
officer
for
alleged
constitutional
violations,
a
holding
that
the
district
court
here
described
as
an
overbroad
statement.
the
courts
below
relied
on
this
court's
statement
in
chappell
that
military
personnel
are
not
barred
from
all
redress
in
civilian
courts
for
constitutional
wrongs.
the
courts
obviously
misread
that
statement,
which
was
followed
by
citations
to
three
cases
that
did
not
involve
claims
for
damages.
as
at
least
three
other
courts
of
appeals
have
concluded,
this
court
in
chappell
clearly
held
that
servicemen
may
not
pursue
bivens
actions
while
indicating
by
the
statement
relied
on
by
the
courts
below
that
in
some
cases
they
may
grant
other
sorts
of
relief.
we
do
not
think
that
courts
should
frequently
grant
other
sorts
of
relief
to
military
personnel,
but
we
acknowledge
that
this
court
has
left
open
that
possibility
in
extreme
cases.
proceeding
to
their
case
by
case
inquiry,
the
courts
below
concluded
that
the
concerns
underlying
feres
and
chappell
are
not
relevant
here
because
respondent
was
not
ordered
to
take
lsd.
while
we
do
not
think
that
any
case
by
case
inquiry
is
warranted,
it
is
nevertheless
clear
that
the
courts
below
erred
in
reaching
their
conclusion.
the
concerns
underlying
feres
are
not
limited
to
cases
involving
direct
orders,
and
it
is
not
clear
where
the
district
court
got
its
contrary
idea.
this
court's
decision
in
feres
nor
this
court's
decision
in
shearer
nor
most
of
the
feres
cases
in
between
involved
any
sort
of
direct
order.
this
court's
made
clear
that
the
rule
of
feres
is
based
on
the
principle
that
the
military
is
under
the
control
of
the
political
branches
and
that
the
judiciary
should
generally
not
review
military
decisions
since
such
litigation
would
undermine
military
discipline
and
effectiveness.
this
court's
decision
in
shearer
is
particularly
instructive.
the
court
there
concluded
that
a
claim
against
the
army
based
on
its
alleged
failure
to
discharge
or
supervise
a
serviceman
who
had
previously
been
convicted
of
manslaughter
would
require
the
courts
to
review
a
decision
of
command
and
would
call
into
question
basic
choices
about
the
supervision
and
control
of
servicemen.
it
could
not
be
more
clear
that
this
case
involves
such
questions.
the
heart
of
respondent's
claim
is
that
the
army
should
not
have
been
using
servicemen
to
study
the
effects
of
lsd
and
that
it
made
a
number
of
mistakes
in
the
way
it
conducted
those
tests.
respondent
is
therefore
challenging
decisions
of
command
and
calling
into
question
basic
decisions
made
by
the
army
in
the
1950s
concerning
the
use
of
military
personnel.
his
claims
are
therefore
barred.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
have
just
a
few
comments,
please.
we
have
been
faced
with
something
of
a
moving
target
on
the
facts
here,
and
i
would
just
like
to
quote
from
the
second
amended
complaint
which
is
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix
that
in
paragraph
11
on
page
6
says
that
respondent
was
14
says
that
the
defendants
were
acting
under
color
of
a
covert
federal
army
program,
and
that
it
was
the
official
policy
that
is
responsible
for
the
deprivation
of
his
rights.
we
take
that
to
mean
that
this
was
an
army
program.
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
real
question
that
it
was
an
army
program,
and
respondent
has--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no,
but--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
would
like
to
mention
that
the
respondent
has
mischaracterized
that.
the
inspector
general
did
issue
a
report
which
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case,
it
is
not
a
public
document,
which
admits
that
a
number
of
violations
were
made,
but
nowhere
suggests
that
testing
chemical
weapons
was
wrong.
it
does
suggest
that
the
consent
forms
used
here
and
the
debriefing
that
was
done
here
was
not
done
the
way,
it
should
have
been
done,
but
no,
there
are
regulations
that
say
that
chemical
weapons
tests
can
be
done.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
don't
have
the
facts
on
this.
the
senate
report
concerning
the
program
prints
one
of
the
sorts
of
consent
forms
that
were
used
in
this
program
which
the
senate
criticized,
but
in
any
event--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
it
did.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
it
did.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
concerning
the
volunteer
point,
i
would
like
to
mention
only
that
we
have
returned
to
a
prior
stage.
the
fifth
circuit
discussed
respondent's
volunteer
point
in
its
1981
opinion
in
the
portion
reprinted
at
pages
72
to
74
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
and
we
think
that
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
fact
that
he
was
or
wasn't
a
volunteer,
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what
respondent's
point
is,
doesn't
matter
in
this
case.
as
a
final
point,
an
estoppel
argument
was
raised
in
respondent's
argument.
that
has
never
been
raised
in
this
case
at
any
point
before,
including
the
briefs
in
this
court.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
there
is
an
intentional
tort
exception
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think
it
is
2680(h).
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
government
has
not
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
intentional
torts.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
am
not
sure
that
an
intentional
tort
of
the
sort
somebody
hit
somebody
has
actually
come
up.
chappell
v.
wallace,
i
suppose
race
discrimination
is
a
form
of
intentional
tort
although
it
is
not
your
run
of
the
mill
form
of
intentional
tort.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
is
right.
in
a
case
where
one
serviceman
happened
to
hit
another
off
base
at
a
bar
or
something
i
suppose--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
am
sure
we
would
get
into
disputes
about
these
matters,
but
one
could
think
that
that
would
be
a
normal
state
law
cause
of
action
that
one
serviceman
might
have
against
another.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
