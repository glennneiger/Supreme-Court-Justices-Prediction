was
he?
justice
white
you
mean
he
went
up
there
for
rest
and
recreation?
justice
white
whatever
the
program
was,
it
was
part
of
the
army,
though,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
how
did
anyone
ever
ask
him
to
volunteer
or
give
him
the
opportunity?
who
asked
him,
or
who
made
it
available
to
him?
justice
white
would
it
have
made
any
difference
if
when
they
were
interviewing
him
they
said,
by
the
way,
will
you
drink
this
glass
of
liquid,
it
has
lsd
in
it,
we
just
want
to
see
how
it
affects
you?
and
he
just,
down
he
went?
justice
white
i
figure
you
probably
will
would
have
been
suing
for
giving
him
lsd
without
telling
him
what
it
might
do
to
him.
justice
white
so
if
they
had
said,
by
the
way,
this
is
lsd,
he
would
have
shaken
his
head
and
said,
so
what?
nobody
knew
was
lsd
was.
justice
white
well,
how
about
the
tort
claims?
justice
white
and
why
did
it?
why
did
it?
justice
white
so
the
regulations
just
bar
any
kind
of
experiments
with--
justice
white
xxx
beats
up
a
subordinate,
and
really
beats
him
up.
is
there
a
bivens
action?
justice
white
maybe
he
did
it
deliberately,
he
just
deliberately
beats
him
up.
he
is
not
negligent
or
anything.
he
just
does
it
on
purpose.
and
it
is
in
violation
of
all
the
regulations.
is
there
a
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
white
well,
let's
forget
that.
do
you
think
the
feres
doctrine
would
bar
that?
justice
white
well,
does
it
or
not?
has
it
been
held
that
or
what?
justice
white
it
certainly
applies
in
negligence
cases,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
how
does
that
ever
affect
discipline?
if
some
officer
just
is
negligent?
justice
white
so
when
would
feres
ever
apply?
it
doesn't
apply
to
intentional
things,
it
doesn't
apply
to
negligence.
justice
white
well,
a
serviceman
sues,
claiming
that
he
was
riding
in
an
airplane
with
his
superior,
who
was
piloting,
and
the
superior
was
just
negligent,
and
they
crashed,
and
he
was
hurt.
justice
white
what
military
discipline
is
involved
in
that?
justice
white
or
anything
that
could
be...
all
you
have
to
do
to
get
around
it
is
to
allege
in
your
complaint
that
it
was
intentional?
justice
white
xxx
the
regulations
giving
him
lsd
or
not?
justice
white
no
what?
justice
white
was
there
any
consent
form
involved
in
this?
justice
white
are
there
cases
that
bar
a
federal
tort
claims
act
for
intentional
torts?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
right.
and
so
it
would
just
be
sovereign
immunity
then?
justice
white
how
about
suits
against
the
officers?
justice
white
what
about
on
base?
