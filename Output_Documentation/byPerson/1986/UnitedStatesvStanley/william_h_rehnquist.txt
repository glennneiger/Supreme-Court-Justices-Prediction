h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
86-393,
the
united
states
versus
james
b.
stanley.
mr.
wright,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
weight,
when
you
say
granted
final
judgment,
was
there
ever
a
judgment
ordered
in
compliance
with
the
separate
document
required?
what
is
that,
rule
58?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
how
about
the
separate
instrument
requirement
of
rule
58?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
it
satisfies
both
those
rules?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
there
decisions
in
the
courts
of
appeals
as
to
whether
or
not
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
certified
question
extends
only
to
the
certified
question
or
whether
its
jurisdiction
extends
to
the
whole
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
kupfer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
he
volunteer?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
he
and
he
alone
received
the
lsd
or
that
others
in
the
same
program
received
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
didn't
get
leave,
did
he,
from
army
duty
for
this
program?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
he
was
still
in
the
army?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
the
nuremberg
code
have
the
effect
of
law,
civil,
positive
law
in
the
united
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
true
of
many
claims
that
are
barred
by
the
feres
doctrine.
there
may
be
something
contrary
to
regulations,
and
the
fact
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
regulations
doesn't
avoid
the
feres
doctrine.
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
the
fact
that
our
military
conduct
violates
regulations
avoid
the
feres
doctrine?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
last
case
in
which
we
held
the
government
was
estopped?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
really
wouldn't
be
an
answer
to
my
question
then,
would
it?
what
i
asked
you
was--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--we
have
never
held
the
government
was
estopped.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
any
federal
jurisdiction
over
an
ordinary
tort
claim
of
one
military
personnel
over
another?
it
is
not
really
a
1983
action.
it
is
not
a
federal
tort
claims
action
because
the
federal
tort
claims
act
provides
that
the
united
states
is
the
defendant
in
substitution
for
everyone
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
the
case
is
submitted.
