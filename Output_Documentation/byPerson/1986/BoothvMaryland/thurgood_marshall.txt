wait
a
minute.
or
at
least
relieved
when
somebody
is
out
of
the
way?

if
the

the
guy
said,
"i

this
is
a
dirty
xxx
and
he's
a
this
and
all
and
all,
but
i'm
a
man
of
god,
and
i
believe
that
i
could
not
but
recommend
it.
"
could
he
leave
the
rest
of
it
off?
justice

well,
could
he
leave
out
some
good
things?
of
course,
he
could.
justice
marshall

question
was
limited
to
the
probation
officer.
he
has
nothing
that
he
can
do
about
the
probation
officer,
absolutely
nothing.
justice
marshall
can
you
give
me
a
case
on
that?
justice
marshall
but
have
you
ever
heard
of
it?
