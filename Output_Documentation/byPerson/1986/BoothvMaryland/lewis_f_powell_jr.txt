justice
jr.
mr.
burns,
i
thought
the
question
before
us
in
this
case
was
admissibility
of
the
victim
impact
statements.
justice
jr.
we
haven't
talked
very
much
about
that,
have
we?
justice
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
was
the
victim
impact
statement
by
the
son
and,
i
guess,
daughter
and
maybe
children,
grandchildren--
justice
jr.
--introduced
in
evidence
at
the
sentencing
hearing?
justice
jr.
were
you
permitted
to
cross-examine?
justice
jr.
under
maryland
law,
you
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine?
if
they
had
testified,
i
think
you
certainly
would
have,
yes,
justice
powell.
what's
the
difference
between
filing
written
statements
and
testifying?
could
you
file
any--
justice
jr.
--any
conflicting...
conflicting
statements?
justice
jr.
you
don't
understand
the
question?
on
page
59
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
victim
impact
statement
of
mr.
and
mrs....
what
is
it?
bronstein?
justice
jr.
and
you
say
that
was
filed
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
and
you
did
not
cross-examine
mr.
and
mrs.
bronstein?
justice
jr.
but
couldn't
you
have...
couldn't
you
have
insisted
they
be
there
so
you
could
cross-examine
them.
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
under
the
maryland
statute...
i'm
sure
it's
here
somewhere,
but
i
haven't
been
able
to
lay
my
hands
on
it...
is
the
effect
of
the
murder
on
the
victim's
family
a
statutory
aggravating
factor?
justice
jr.
it
is
in
getting
to
the
case
in
any
event?
justice
jr.
i
say--
justice
jr.
--there's
a
separate
statute
in
maryland
that
says
this
is
admissible
in
a
capital
case?
justice
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
although
counsel
for
the
defendant
in
this
case
objected
to
the
introduction
of
this
victim
impact
statement,
counsel
did
not
choose
to
cross-examine
the
parties
who
signed
these
testimonials
as
to
the
effect
of
the
murder
on
them.
justice
jr.
would
he
have
had
the
right
to
cross-examine
those
people?
could
you--
justice
jr.
--could
you
have
introduced
a
statement
if
he
had
objected
and
said,
"if
you
bring
them
up
here,
i'm
going
to
cross-examine
them?
"
justice
jr.
to
cross-examine
them?
justice
jr.
mr.
monk,
while
we're
talking
about
maryland
practice,
could
the
substance
of
this
statement
have
been
introduced
in
the
trial
itself?
