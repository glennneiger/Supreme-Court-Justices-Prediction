justice
stevens
general
monk,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
in
your
response
to
justice
o'connor
prompt,
you
described
the
statement,
"it
reflects
the
aggravated
nature
of
the
crime.
"
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
state
statute
to
provide
that
if
a
victim
leaves
surviving
two
or
three
children,
that
shall
be
considered
an
aggravating
circumstance,
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
justifying
the
death
penalty
might
not
otherwise
be
justified?
justice
stevens
and
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional
to
do
that
is
what
i
am
asking.
justice
stevens
no,
i
understand.
although
one
could
argue
that
the
effect
of
it
is
pretty
much
the
same
because
it...
i
suppose
it
could...
this
bit
of
evidence
could
make
the
difference
between
the
jury
finding
a
man...
imposing
the
death
sentence
and
not
doing
so.
that
must
be
the
very
purpose
of
it.
indeed,
i
don't
understand
what
you've
done
here
if...
why
it
is...
why
it
should
not
be
excluded
as
totally
irrelevant
evidence
unless
it
is
an
aggravating
circumstance.
what
does
it
bear
upon
unless
it
bears
upon
aggravation?
justice
stevens
so
it
is
an
aggravating
circumstance
established
by
a
separate
statute.
it
is
just
not
listed
in
the
other
statute
that
lists
all
the
aggravating
circumstances?
justice
stevens
but
i
suppose
it
could
be
made
that
under
your
view
of
the
case?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand.
so
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
stevens
no,
but
as
i
understand
it,
you
think
there
could
be.
there
would
be
no
constitutional
objection
to
that
because
the
argument
would
be
precisely
the
same?
justice
stevens
well,
if
it
can
make
the
difference,
and
i
think
you've
accepted
that
it
could,
between
having
a
death
sentence
imposed
in
one
case
and
not
in
another
case,
which
was
identical
except
for
the
absence
of
an
impact
statement,
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
the
classic
example
of
an
aggravating
circumstance.
justice
stevens
well,
this
is
one
classic...--
0
[inaudibles.]
--the
only
victims
who
had
children
which
would
limit
it
but
as
compared
to
victims
who
did
not
have
children.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
think
you
must
make
that
argument
in
order
to
sustain
the
statute.
justice
stevens
general
monk,
while
you're
interrupted.
can
i
ask
one
other
thing?
about
this
aggravating
circumstance,
killing
a
police
officer...
and
the
statute
doesn't
require
that
the
defendant
know
that
he
was
a
police
officer--
justice
stevens
--has
the
appellate
court
in
maryland
construed
that
statute
and
held
that
that
is
a
correct
instruction?
justice
stevens
it
has?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
general
monk,
doesn't
the
jury
also
know
that?
if
that's
so...
common
knowledge,
why
do
you
need
the
victim
impact
statement?
justice
stevens
and
makes
it
more
likely
that
it
will
impose
the
death
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
burns,
may
i
suggest
that
you
and
justice
scalia
are
not
communicating
because
he's
talking
about
non-death
cases.
and
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it
is
the
difference
between
life
and
death:
it
can't
be
based
on
a
factor
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
blackness
of
the
man's
soul.
justice
stevens
but
his
examples
are
all
non-death
cases.
