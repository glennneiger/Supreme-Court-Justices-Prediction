justice
o'connor
mr.
burns,
do
you
suppose
that
it's
possible
for
a
state
to
make
it
an
aggravating
circumstance
to
murder
someone
who
is
a
policeman?
justice
o'connor
well,
maybe;
maybe
not.
do
you
think
the
state
can
make
it
an
aggravating
circumstance
to
murder
the
parent
of
minor
children?
justice
o'connor
well,
maybe;
maybe
not.
that's
the
issue.
does
the
defendant's
knowledge
of
that
have
to
be
a
component,
or
is
it
possible
to
take
into
consideration
the
scope
of
harm
to
society?
justice
o'connor
mr.
burns,
aren't
there
a
number
of
states
with
capital
punishment
laws
that
look
to,
as
an
aggravating
circumstance,
the
extent
to
which
other
people
might
have
been
endangered
by
the
conduct?
justice
o'connor
no.
i
think
there
are
a
number
that
look
to
the
extent
to
which
other
people
were
endangered,
not
killed.
justice
o'connor
let
me
come
back
just
a
minute
and
say
that...
or
inquire
whether
you
think
it
is
generally
foreseeable
when
you
murder
someone
that
it's
very
likely
you
will
leave
a
number
of
family
members
distraught
and
devastated,
that
that's
the
likelihood,
really?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
just
if
you
limit
it
to
that
kind
of
reasonable
concern,
do
you
think
that's
inherently
improper,
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
other
aggravating
circumstances
that
states
have
adopted?
justice
o'connor
mr.
monk,
i
think
the
question
i
have
i'd
like
you
to
address,
frankly,
is
that
the
maryland
sentencing
scheme,
as
you've
been
describing
it
and
as
the
record
discloses,
is
very
specific.
in
fact,
the
jury
is
actually
given
a
form--
justice
o'connor
--and
it
lists
the
aggravating
circumstances,
and
the
jury
is
told
to
check
off
on
the
form
what
ones
it
finds.
and
the
form
includes
space
to
put
the
mitigating
circumstances.
and
they're
asked
to
say
what
they
are.
and
then
they're
told
that
if
they
find
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
the
mitigating,
they
are
to
return
the
sentence
of
death.
justice
o'connor
now,
the
use
of
the
victim
impact
statement
is
not
described
on
the
form
for
sentencing.
it's
doesn't
fit
into
this
very
precise
procedural
scheme
at
all.
and
it
appears
to
me
that
the
victim
impact
law
was,
perhaps,
passed
later
and
is
kind
of
an
add-on,
and
that
the
form
has
never
been
adjusted
to
reflect
how
the
jury
is
to
use
it.
and,
indeed,
in
this
case
it
was
just
the
subject
of
argument
by
the
prosecutor,
i
suppose,
after
the
statement
had
been
admitted.
and
i'm
concerned
about
what
you
see
about
the
kind
of
guidance
that
would
meet
federal
constitutional
standards
in
a
death-sentencing
scheme
is
required
for
the
use
of
victim
impact
statements.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
if
i'd
been
a
juror,
i
might
have
been
quite
confused
about
what
use
to
make
of
the
victim
impact
statement
in
a
scheme
like
maryland's
that
has
been
made
so
specific.
and
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
for
help.
justice
o'connor
nowhere
are
they
told
to
do
that
though.
justice
o'connor
--mr.
monk,
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
recommendation
of
the
surviving
family
members
as
to
the
proper
punishment
to
be
imposed?
justice
o'connor
wasnt'
there
something
in
the
victim
impact
statement
here
that
really
incorporated
their
recommendations?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
you
don't...
you
don't
stand
here
and
try
to
justify
introducing
before
the
jury
the
recommendation
of
family
members
on
the
penalty?
justice
o'connor
and
so
what
would
you
do
to
the
extent
they're
included?
should
they
be
removed--
justice
o'connor
--from
the
statement?
redacted--
justice
o'connor
--and
arguably,
a
couple
of
these
should
have
been
redacted?
