justice
scalia
you'd
allow
it
to
be
introduced,
i
presume,
if
as
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances,
it
was
shown
that
the
victim
was
tortured
to
death
in
front
of
his
wife
or
something
like
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
scalia
then
the
fact
that
the
wife
was
so
much
aggrieved
by
it
you
think
would
be
relevant?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
in
principle
you
say
simply
the
fact
that
the
crime
does
more
harm
is
not
a
valid
aggravating
factor.
let's
assume
that
i'm
pulling
a
bank
robbery
and
i
aim
at
a
guard
intending
to
kill
him.
if
i
happen
to
kill
him,
i'm
liable
for
much
graver
punishment
than
if
my
aim
is
bad
and
he's
only
wounded;
correct?
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
you
certainly
would
not
deny
that
a
state
can
have
different
punishments,
and
considerably
different,
for
a
murder
that
goes
awry,
and
one
that
is
actually
committed.
justice
scalia
although
the
evil
of
the
person
who
pulls
the
trigger,
the
blackness
of
his
soul,
is
exactly
the
same;
right?
he's
just
as
bad
a
person.
justice
scalia
so
somehow
the
harm
that
is
inflicted
upon
society
is
a
perfectly
valid
factor.
now,
why
does
it
just
have
to
be
the
harm
upon
the
victim?
justice
scalia
when
you
know
you're
going
to
miss?
i
mean,
the
hypothesis
is
you
intend
to
hit
him
square
in
the
forehead,
and
in
one
case
you
miss.
justice
scalia
i
could
say
if
you
do,
you're
unlucky.
i
mean,
you
know,--
justice
scalia
--which
direction
you
want
to
look
at
it
from.
but
the
point
is:
it
seems
to
me
you're
talking
about
culpability
as
though
the
only
elements
that
go
into
culpability
are
how
wicked
is
your
intent,
number
one,
and
perhaps,
perhaps...
well,
i
guess
that's
it.
how
wicked
is
your
intent?
it
seems
to
me
that
another
quite
independent
element
of
culpability
is
simply
how
great
is
the
harm
you
did.
how
great
is
the
harm
that
you
did?
justice
scalia
it's
not
deterrence;
it's
not
deterrence.
it's
expression
of
society's
outrage
and
revulsion.
justice
scalia
call
it
vindication,
if
you
like.
justice
scalia
call
it
vindication,
if
you
like.
justice
scalia
you
think...
you
think
that
you
can't
be
convicted
of
the
crime
of
killing
a
federal
officer
unless
you
knew
he
was
federal
officer?
justice
scalia
right?
justice
scalia
you
don't
take
the
victim
the
way
you
find
him?
you
look
down
and
you
say,
"my
god,
i've
killed
a
federal
officer.
"
justice
scalia
i'll
tell
you...
well,
i
don't
think
reasonably.
you
have
no
idea
whether
he's
your
federal
officer
or
not
when
you...
when
you
kill
him.
and
if
you've
killed
a
federal
officer,
i
think
you
take
your
victim
the
way
you
find
him.
justice
scalia
and
if
you
rob
a
bank
and
you
don't
know
that
it's
a
federal
bank,
you're...
you're
not
prosecutable
under
the
laws
governing
the
robbery
of
a
federal
bank?
justice
scalia
everybody
realizes...
everybody
realizes
people
have
relatives
whom
they
leave
behind.
justice
scalia
and
all
that
this
statute
permits
is
those
relatives
to
come
in
and
demonstrate
the
harm
that
this
individual
has
done,
just
as...
just
as
he's
entitled
to
put
on
exculpatory
testimony,
his
mother
coming
on
and
saying,
you
know,
"it
was
my
fault",
or
whatever.
justice
scalia
these
are
just
the
realities
of
things.
justice
scalia
then
you're
getting
back
to
your
assumption
that
the
only
proper
basis
for
setting
a
level
of
punishment
is
the
nature
of
his
soul.
and
what
i'm
saying
is,
it
isn't.
it's
also
the
amount
of
harm
that
he's
caused.
justice
scalia
don't
you
go
too
far
when
you
say
that
the
jury
knows
that
he
has
a
family?
the
jury
knows
that
he
may
have
a
family.
that's
all
the
jury
knows.
this
shows
that,
in
fact,
he
does
have
a
family.
justice
scalia
just
as
the
jury
knows
that
he
may
have
had
a
deprived
childhood.
but
the
exculpatory
evidence
that
can
come
in
shows
that
he,
in
fact,
did
have
a
deprived
childhood.
justice
scalia
general
monk,
i
assume
that
the
same
thing
is
true
of
all
of
the...
of
all
of
the
aggravating
factors
that
the
state
doesn't
have
to
introduce
everyone
of
them
if
it
doesn't
want
to.
justice
scalia
there's
no
obligation
on
the
state
to
come
forward
with
an
aggravating
factor
though
it
may
exist.
justice
scalia
what
is...--
0

justice
scalia
0
xxx.
--aggravating
factor.
why
is
that
more...--
justice
scalia
if
you
assume
that
the
only
thing
relevant
is
how
evil
is
the
defendant.
justice
scalia
how
much
harm
has
the
defendant
done?
justice
scalia
if
you
assume
it's...
it's
those
two
only,
and
not,
i
think--
justice
scalia
--you
may
think
that
the
difference
between
murder
and
attempted
murder
is
arbitrary;
i
don't.
and
i
don't
think
your
law
states
that.
justice
scalia
a
distinction
you've
drawn
between
them.
justice
scalia
when
you
kill
someone,
you
know
he's
either
going
to
have
a
family
or
he's
not
going
to
have
a
family.
justice
scalia
but
the
intent
of
the
two
defendants
is
exactly
the
same;
they
both
intended
to
kill
the
person.
justice
scalia
and
the
only
reason
you
punish
one
more
than
the
other
is
not
because
he
knew
more
or
he
intended
more,
but
simply
because
he
did
more
harm.
that's
the
only
reason.
justice
scalia
that's
not
comparable.
that's
not
at
all
comparable
with
what's
going
on
here.
we're...
we're
not
saying,
is
it
a
nice
family,
or
is
it
a
bad
family.
it's
just
how
much
has
the
family
been
harmed?
justice
scalia
0
xxx.
--who
they
are.
it's
not--
justice
scalia
--saying
some
families
are
worth
a
lot
and
other
families
are
worth
nothing.
that's
not
what's
going
on.
