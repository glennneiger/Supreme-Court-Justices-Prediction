mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
victim
impact
evidence
can
be
introduced
at
the
sentencing
phase
of
a
capital
case
consistent
with
the
eighth
amendment.
we
believe
that
it
can
under
maryland's
carefully
devised
capital
sentencing
process.
the
maryland
general
assembly
has
chosen
to
include
victim
impact
evidence
in
the
death
penalty
process.
in
doing
so,
however,
maryland
has
not
undermined
the
substantial
safeguards
of
its
process
that
guide
the
discretion
of
the
sentencer
and
insure
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
imposed
in
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
manner.
in
fact,
i
suggest
that
maryland's
bifurcated
death
penalty
procedure
contains
many
more
procedural
safeguards
than
other
sentencing
procedures
already
approved
by
this
court.
maryland
has
ten
limited
circumstances
where
the
death
penalty
may
be
appropriate.
with
the
exception
of
a
person
that
contracts
for
murder,
only
a
principal
in
the
first
degree,
that
is,
one
that
actually
commits
the
murder
or
kills
the
victim,
is
subject
to
capital
punishment
in
maryland.
the
aggravated
murderers,
where
the
death
penalty
can
be
imposed,
include
such
things
as
victim...
as
the
victim
was
a
law
enforcement
officer.
and
let
me
stop
here,
justice
scalia.
in
maryland,
the
defendant
would
not
have
to
know
that
the
victim
was
a
law
enforcement
officer.
it
would
be
sufficient
that
the...
that
the
victim
was
a
law
enforcement
officer
on
duty
to
constitute
an
aggravated
circumstance
under
the
maryland
statute.
another...
another
example
of
the
aggravated
circumstances
required
by
the
maryland
statute
is
that
the
victim
was
taken
or
attempted
to
be
taken
in
the
course
of
a
kidnapping
or
abduction.
in
this
case,
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
that
the
defendant
committed
the
murder
while
committing
robbery.
under
maryland's
death
penalty
law,
if
no
aggravating
circumstance
is
found,
then
life
imprisonment
is
the
sentence.
however,
if
one
or
more
aggravating
circumstances
are
found
to
exist
and
the
standard
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
we
shift
to
mitigating
circumstances
for
consideration.
in
addition
to
stat.
7,
statutorily
defined
mitigating
circumstances,
maryland
also
permits
the
defendant
wide
discretion
to
present
other
facts
in
mitigation.
mitigating
circumstances
under
the
maryland
procedure
must
only
be
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
a
single
mitigating
circumstance
is
sufficient
under
the
maryland
procedure
to
outweigh
whatever
aggravating
circumstances
are
found
and
indicate
that
life
sentence
is
appropriate.
in
this
case,
the
jury
found
and
noted
on
the
verdict
sheet
under
the
open-ended-other-facts
category
that
the
defendant's
family
environment,
child
neglect,
and
lack
of
strong
father
image
were
mitigating
factors.
i
think
this
is
important
because
it
indicates
that
the
jury
was,
in
fact,
listening
to
the
evidence
and
understanding
what
the
defendant
was
presenting.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
justice
o'connor,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
there
is
no
place
on
the
form
for
the
jury
directly
to
consider
victim
impact
evidence.
but
i
disagree
with
you
that
is
not
clearly
a
part
of
the
process.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
i
think,
addressed
exactly
your
concern
when
it
said
the
victim
impact
evidence
reflects
the
gravity
or
aggravating
circumstances
of
the
crime.
there's
no
place
on
the
form,
i
might
say,
for
a
description
of
the
heinous
nature
of
the
crime,
the
fact
that
the
bronsteins
were
bound
and
gagged
and
stabbed
numerous
times.
there's
no
place
on
the
form
for
the
jury
to
look
at
that
evidence
either.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
suggest
to
you,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
process,
what
the
jury
was
supposed
to
do
in
this
case
and
i
think
was
maryland's
process
calls
for,
is
that
once
the
jury
finds
the
threshold
of
an
aggravated
murder,
that
it
was
committed
in
the
case
in
connection
with
a
robbery,
then
they
take
into
consideration
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
the
victim
impact,
the
defendant's
criminal
record,
in
considering
the
aggravating
quality
of
the
crime,
and
then
weigh
that
against
the
mitigating
circumstances
presented
by
the
defendant.
it's...
it's
not
there
on
the
form,
but
it
is
part
of
the
process.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
think
there
could
be
an
instruction
if
there
was
not
a
request
for
such
an
instruction
in
this
case.
there
was
an
instruction,
however
that
say...
that
said
that
you
weigh...
that
gave...
the
suggestions
to
the
jury
about
what
an
aggravating
circumstance
meant
and
what
a
mitigating
circumstance
meant.
and
i
think
that
that
kind
of
instruction
is
sufficient
for
the
jury
to
understand
the
process
that
it's
undertaking.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
it
is
not,
justice
powell.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
pardon
me.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
how
does
it
come
in?
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
right.
the
statute...
the
general
assembly
has
defined
what
evidence
is
admissible
in
a
capital
case.
and
among
that
list
is
a
pre-sentence
report
including
the
victim
impact
statement.
and
that's
how
it
comes
into
the
process.
the
pre-sentence
report
details
the
criminal
history
of
the
defendant
and
some
relevant
information
about
his
background.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
and,
in
fact,
the
statement,
as
the
petitioner
has
indicated
in
argument,
came
in
as
a
joint
exhibit
of
the--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--would
have--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--i
think
he
could
have,
and
i
think
the
court
would
have
been
required
to
give
him
the
opportunity
to
rebut
the
evidence.
under
maryland's
scheme,
it
clear--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--yes.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
think
the
statute,
itself,
reflects
it,
justice
marshall.
the
statute
says--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--yes,
it
does.
but
the
statute
also
indicates--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--it
says,
including
a
victim
impact
statement,
in
the
description
of
the
pre-sentence
report.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
it's
in
the
statute,
i
believe.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
also
the...
i
think
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
earlier
decision
in
lodowski
where
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
opportunity
to
construe
this
statute
is
further
guidance
in
that
case.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
think
in
the
same
vein
that
i
think
it's
permissible
that
we
decide
that
the
commission
of...
or
murder
of
a
police
officer
in
the
course
of
his
duties:
if
the
general
assembly
were
to
decide
that,
i
think
it's
possible
that
that
could
be
considered
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance.
i
don't
think
that's--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--i
think
they
could
do
so
constitutionally.
i
don't
think
that
is
what
they
have
done
here.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
justice
scalia,
indeed,
that's
what
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
said.
they
said
this
evidence
reflects
the
gravity
of
the
crime
and
the
aggravating
quality
of
the
crime--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--that's
right.
but
in
a
sense,
we're
playing
a
bit
of
a
word
game
here
because
aggravating
circumstances
within
the
meaning
of
the
maryland
statutes
are
thresholds
which
have
to
be
crossed
before
you
become
death
eligible.
and
it's...
it
is
not
that.
and
that's
important
to
understand.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
maryland
general
assembly
could
decide
that
a
police
officer
killed
in
the
performance
of
duty
constitutes
an
aggravating
circumstance,--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--i
think
they
could
decide
that,
yes.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
exactly
right.
you
have
to
be
a
principal
in
the
first
degree
and
find
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance.
then
you
consider--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--that
is
exactly
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
argument
would
be
precisely
the
same.
but
i...
but
i
don't
think...--
0
[inaudibles.]
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
under
the
maryland
scheme,
and
i
think
under
the
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
the
state
should
and
is
required
to
limit
and
define
those
cases...--
0
[inaudibles.]
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
i
would
agree
that
they
could
do
so,
and
the
general
assembly
could
do
so.
whether
this
court
would
find
that
as
it
has
with
respect
to
rape
that
that's...
that
that's
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
i
can't
say.
but
i
think
as
a
logical
matter,
they
could
do
so
and
create
that
threshold,
aggravating
circumstance,
as
opposed
to
how
the
evidence
came
in
in
this
case
which
is...
goes
to
the
aggravating--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--quality
or
nature
of
the
crime.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
more
words
about
the
maryland
statutory
scheme
itself
because
i
think
once
the
court
understands
the
scheme
and
understands
the
safeguards
built
into
the
scheme,
they
will
understand
why
the
introduction
of
this
evidence
was
not
arbitrary
or
create
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
result.
under
the
maryland
law,
whenever
the
death
penalty
is
imposed,
the
decision
is
subject
to
immediate
review
and
direct
review
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
in
addition,
the
trial
judge
must
submit
a
report
to
the
court
of
appeals
detailing
information
about
the
defendant,
the
conduct
of
the
trial,
and
a
recommendation
by
the
trial
judge
as
to
whether
imposition
of
the
sentence
of
death
is
justified.
now
let
me
say,
the
defendant
has
a
choice
in
maryland.
he
can
choose
the
jury
or
he
can
choose
the
trial
judge
at
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
process.
and
the
jury's
decision
is
binding
if
he
chooses
the
jury.
in
reviewing
the
case,
the
court
of
appeals
is
specifically
required
under
maryland
statute
to
determine
whether
the
sentence
of
death
was
imposed
under
the
influence
of
passion,
prejudice,
or
any
other
arbitrary
factor.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
introduction
of
the
victim
impact
evidence
did
not
present
an
arbitrary
factor.
as
a
final
consideration,
the
court
of
appeals
undertakes
a
proportionality
review
to
determine
whether
the
sentence
is
excessive
or
disproportionate
to
the
penalty
imposed
in
a
similar
case,
considering
both
the
crime
and
the
defendant.
it
is,
i
suggest
to
you,
in
the
face
of
this
carefully
devised
statutory
scheme,
that
petitioner
would
have
this
court
rule
that
victim
impact
evidence
cannot
be
introduced
consistent
with
the
eighth
amendment.
we
submit
to
do
so
would
be
improper
extension
of
the
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
it
has
long
been
recognized
that
retribution
is
a
valid
rationale
for
the
death
penalty.
in
non-capital
cases,
it
is
typical
in
assessing
a
punishment
to
be
imposed
to
consider
the
impact
of
the
crime
upon
the
victim.
as
justice
marshall
noted
earlier,
maryland
just
suffered
through
a
savings
and
loan
crisis.
when
we
came
to
the
point
of
sentencing
the
criminals
involved
in
the
savings
and
loan
crisis,
certainly
the
impact
of
their
crimes
on
the
state
of
maryland
was
a
relevant
consideration
and
was
appropriately
taken
into
consideration
by
the
court.
and
i
don't
think
it
offended
the
eighth
amendment
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
to
do
so.
indeed,
we
recognize
in
our
system
of
legal
process,
to
paraphrase
the
words
of
justice
stewart
in
gregg,
that
channeling
the
instinct
for
retribution
through
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
is
essential
in
an
ordered
society
that
asks
its
citizens
to
rely
upon
legal
processes
rather
than
self-help
to
vindicate
their
wrongs.
consequently,
it
is
entirely
consistent
with
this
long-recognized
precept
of
criminal
justice
that
maryland
provide
the
sentencer
in
capital
cases
with
a
victim
impact
information
that
can
be
used
in
considering
what
retribution
should
be
exacted
as
a
consequence
of
the
defendant's
conduct.
significantly
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
there
is
a
reasonable
nexus
between
the
impact
of
the
crime
upon
the
victim's
family
and
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime,
especially
as
i
said
before,
as
to
the
gravity
or
aggravating
quality
of
the
offense.
thus,
the
maryland
court
appropriately
gives
deference
to
the
maryland
statutory
scheme
and
holds
that
victim
impact
evidence
is
admissible
simply
as
another
circumstance
of
the
crime.
it
is
not,
and
let
me
emphasize
this,
indeed
it
cannot
be,
under
the
maryland
law,
a
call
for
the
death
penalty.
this
is
not
private
vengeance.
instead,
it
simply
provides
additional
probative
information
that
the
sentencer
can
use
in
weighing
the
aggravating
nature
of
the
crime
against
whatever
mitigating
circumstances
it
has
found.
the
introduction
of
this
victim
impact
evidence
is
not
as
petitioner
suggests
"wholly
arbitrary".
under
the
maryland
statutory
scheme,
it
must
be
admitted
in
every
case
whether
it
is
traumatic
or
inconsequential.
in
this
regard,
it
is
no
more
arbitrary
than
the
crime
itself.
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--yes,
i
do.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
the
court
requested
a
pre-sentence
report.
and
the
probation
officer
then
interviewed
the
family
of
the
victim
and
reported--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--in
this
case
the
court
did
not
specifically
request
information
about
the
victim's
family.
he
did
request
a
pre-sentence
report.
and,
as
part
of
that
pre-sentence
report,
the
probation
officer
conducted
an
interview
of
the
family
and
prepared
the
victim
impact
statements
that
were
admitted
in
evidence
as
a--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--the
judge
could
instruct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
he
was
not
requested
to
do
so
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
can't
speak
across
all
of
maryland's
cases.
but
i
certainly
think
it's
appropriate
to
do
so.
and
i
think
i--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--i
have
not...
i
do
not
know
of
such
an
instance.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
read
the
victim
impact
statements.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
he
argued
from
it
that
there...
that
this
was
a
serious
crime,
and
it
caused
harm
to
the
defendant's
family...
the
victim's
family.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
in
this
case
the
aggravating
circumstance
was
that
the
crime
was
committed
while
committing
a
robbery.
it
helped
illuminate
the
fact
that
the
crime
was
particularly
heinous
and
that
it
caused
severe
harm.
and
that
was
weighed
against
the
mitigating
circumstances
proffered
by
the
defendant.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
number
ten
that
the...
on
the
maryland
statutory
scheme,
that
the
crime
was
committed
while
committing
robbery.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--no.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
you
see
that...
under
the
maryland
scheme,
there
is
no
direction
that
you
look
for
especially
heinous
or
anything
of
that
nature
as
there
is
in
other
state
statutes.
under
the
maryland
scheme,
what
happens
is
that
once
you
have
met
the
threshold
that
the
crime
was
committed
while
committing
a...
murder
was
committed
while
committing
a
robbery,
then
the
aggravating
nature
of
the
crime,
itself,
the
criminal
history
of
the
defendant
and
the
impact
upon
the
victim's
family--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--comes
into
evidence
and
is
used
as
a
weight
on
that
side
to
compare
to
the
mitigating
circumstances
presented
by
the
defendant.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
yes.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
yes.
let
me
just
say
which...
that
takes
me
to
my
next
point
which
is
foreseeability.
i
think
foreseeability
is
an
important...
an
important
question
here.
and
i
agree
with
justice
rehnquist
that
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
on
the
defendant's
direction...
direct
acts...
on
his
knowing
act
is
what's
at
issue.
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
defendant
knows,
i
believe,
or
should
have
known,
when
he
takes
another
person's
life,
that
the
family
of
the
victim
will
suffer
greatly
as
a
consequence
of
his
conduct
even
if
he
doesn't
know
who
the
family
is.
he
knows
that
the
person...
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
knows
the
person
has
a
family,
and
they're
going
to
suffer
as
a
result
of
his
wanton
act.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
goes
back
to
my
earlier
point
that
i...
and
i
think
it's
a
legislative
judgment
that
maryland
has
made
that
there's
a
role
to
play
for
victim
impact
evidence
when
we
get
to
that
final
stage,
after
we
have
determined
that
this
is
an
aggravated
murder,
and
we
have
met
all
the
other
prerequisites
of
principal
in
the
first
degree
and
so
forth,
when
we
get
to
the
weighing
of
the
moral
judgment,
the
maryland
general
assembly
has
said,
why
can't
we
have
a
limited
introduction
of
the
impact
of
the
crime
upon
the
victim?
personalize...
personalize
the
facts
from
the
victim's
side
when
the
jury
makes
that
moral
judgment
of
weighing--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
necessarily
come
to
that
conclusion.
you
know,
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--he
does
have
a
family.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
can
imagine
the
victim
impact
statement
that
would
not,
in
any
way,
indicate
or
add
to
the
aggravating
quality
of
the
crime.
for
instance,
suppose
the
victim
didn't
have
a
family
at
all,
the
victim
impact
statement
would
indicate
that.
a
family--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
i
don't
think
it
would
add
to
the
heinous
nature
of
the
crime.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
obviously,
he
committed
this
murder.
nothing
is
going
to
help
him--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--from
the
victim's
side
of
the
equation.
nor,
i
guess,
in
maryland's
judgment,
should
it.
what
maryland
has
done
here
is
found
a
role,
and
we
think
an
appropriate
role,
consistent
with
the
eighth
amendment
for
the
victims
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
under
maryland's
procedure,
they
are
explicitly
not
permitted
to
make
any
demand
for
death
penalty
or
what...
any
recommendation
whatsoever.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
think
there
were
two
comments
that
are--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--pointed
out
by
petitioner
in
amici.
one
comment
is
something
to
the
effect
that
they
were
seeking
swift
justice.
i
certainly
don't
think
that
necessarily
implicates
the
death
penalty.
and
the
other
comment
was
that
the
defendant
not
be
permitted
to
commit
this
type
of
crime
again.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
life
imprisonment
accomplishes
that
end.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--i
do
not.
indeed,
it
cannot
be
under
the
maryland
statute.
it's
specifically
excluded
by
the
maryland
statute.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
they
should
be
redacted--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--the
trial
court
should
redact
any
such
statements?
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
think
reasonable
minds
could
differ
on
whether
they
could
or
they
couldn't.
the
trial
judge
didn't
think
so.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
also
decided
that
they...
that
they
were
not
necessary
to
do
so.
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
anybody
looking
at
this
automatically
would
say,
"gee,
i...
maybe
this
goes
too
far.
"
i
think
the
question
before
this
court
is
not
whether
a
few
of
these
statements
are
beyond
what
they
should
have
been
under
the
maryland
statute
or
not,
but
whether
this
evidence
comes
in
at
all
under
the
eighth
amendment.
and
i
think
maryland
has
found
a
way
to
include
it
within
the
process
without
making
the
process
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
no,
it
could
not
as
far
as
i
can
see,
justice
powell.
i
was
speaking
about
the
foreseeability
of
this,
and
let
me
just
finally
make
my
points
on
that.
indeed,
if
you...
if
we
accept
the
premise
that
the
defendant
knows
or
should
have
known
that
there's
a
family
to
be
harmed
when
he
commits
the
murder,
then
as
the
sentencer
judges
his
moral
capacity,
it
is
called
upon
to
recognize
whether
he
felt
any
concern
or
remorse
for
the
harm
caused
to
the
victim
and
the
victim's
family.
in
this
case,
the
evidence
showed
the
defendant
was
particularly
callous
to
the
grave
harm
he
caused
others
when
he
described
to
his
cohorts
that
they
should
pay
no
mind
to
the
brutally
murdered
bodies
of
mr.
and
mrs.
bronstein
when
they
returned
to
the
house
to
ransack
and
steal
more
property.
he,
obviously,
was
totally
unconcerned
that
the
bronstein
family
would
suffer
greatly
from
his
brutal
acts.
he
was
simply
concerned
about
taking
their
property
without
getting
caught.
nevertheless,
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
was
or
should
have
been
completely
foreseeable
to
booth,
especially
considering
he
lived
two
houses
down
the
street,
that
the
family
would
suffer
greatly
as
a
direct
result
of
his
conduct.
consequently,
it
is
not
at
all
unfair
to
require
that
the
sentencer
consider
victim
impact
evidence
in
making
a
moral
judgment
regarding
booth's
crimes.
one
other
point
that
i
want
to
respond
to
that
the
petitioner
has
made
is
the
emotional
impact
of
this
evidence.
petitioner
claims
that
victim
impact
evidence
is
so
emotionally
charged
as
to
introduce
an
arbitrary
factor
that
will
disrupt
the
exercise
of
the
guided
discretion
of
the
sentencer.
victim
impact
evidence
may
well
be
emotional.
however,
by
itself,
this
should
not
be
a
problem
of
constitutional
dimension.
first,
the
trial
court
can
instruct
the
jury
upon
the
use
of
victim
impact
evidence,
although
as
i
have
said
here,
he
was
not
requested
to
do
so.
secondly--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
that's
essentially...
i
think
that's
essentially
correct.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
said
something
to
the
effect
that
the
sentencer
may
consider
the
impact
of
the
offense
upon
the
victim
or
the
victim's
family
as
it
relates
to
the
gravity
or
aggravating
quality
of
the
crime.
and
i
think
that's
appropriate.
that's
what
it
comes
in...
that's
the
place
in
the
process
that
it
comes
in.
it
just
like
a
description
of
the
crime,
itself.
if
this
case
were
sent
back,--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--it
comes
in
in
every
case,
whether
the
prosecutor
wants
it
in
or
not.
and
so
that's
another
reason
why
i
don't
think
it's
arbitrary.
it
is...
whatever
it
is,
it
is
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
that
is...
and
the
consequences
of
the
crime
that
is
before
the
sentencer
when
they're
weighing
and
making
the
moral
judgment
they're
called
upon
to
make.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
the
probation
officer
does,
yes,
justice.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
he
puts
in
whatever--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--whatever
he
finds.
he
puts
in
whatever
he
finds.
and
the
defendant
is
given
the
opportunity
to
challenge
whatever
evidence
comes
in...--
0
xxx.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
is
it
up
to
the--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--he
can't...
he
can't
recommend
a
sentence.
he
could--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--of
course,
he
could.
but
let
me
say
this.
under
the
maryland
process,
justice
marshall,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
rebut
whatever
evidence
that
comes
in.
and
so
if
there's
any
doubt
that
the
facts
have
not
come
out
fairly
in
the
victim
impact
statement,
he
has
the
opportunity
to
present
countervailing
evidence.
but
he
does
have
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
if
he
suggests
to
the
court--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
i...
the
evidence
doesn't
have
to
come
in
to
the
probation
officer.
i
mean,
the
victim...
at
the
sentencing
phase
on
a
capital
case,
there
is
some
evidence
that
comes
in
as
hearsay.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
assume
that
he
could
call
the
probation
officer
and
ask
him
how
he
prepared
the
report.
there's
nothing
in
the
process--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
the
statute,
itself,
permits
him
to
rebut,
and
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
he
can
do
whatever
is
reasonable
to
rebut
under
the
maryland--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--i
have
not
seen--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--to
my
knowledge,
i
have
never
seen
a
case
where
he's
called.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
but
that
doesn't...
that's
not
to
say
that
it
couldn't
be
done.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
the
state
needs
only
to
demonstrate
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
exist.
thank
you.
