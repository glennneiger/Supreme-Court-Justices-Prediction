mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
maryland
may
constitutionally
execute
a
defendant
based
on
a
public
opinion
poll.
this
court
has
repeatedly...
most
recently
in
this
term
in
california
versus
brown...
said
there
are
two
relevant
considerations
in
a
capital
sentencing.
first,
the
defendant's
background.
obviously
that's
not
at
issue
in
victim
impact
statements.
the
second
thing
are
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
of
course,
in
a
normal
way
are
also
not
involved.
there's
no
contention
that
the
victims
who
testified
were
at
the
crime
scene,
were
involved
with
the
crime,
but
that
the
crime
was
instituted
against
them
as
opposed
to
the
actual
victims.
the
state,
however,
argues
that
this
is
still
part
of
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
the
argument
really
comes
down
to
no
more
than
saying,
"if
i
cast
a
pebble
into
the
ocean,
the
ripples
just
go
on
forever.
"
the
problem
with
that,
i
think,
is
not
only
has
it
never
been
used
as
a
basis
for
criminal
sentencing,
it's
probably
not
even
a
good
basis
for
tort
law.
the
implications
are
simply
staggering,
because
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
each
and
every
one
of
us
is
offended
by
violent
crime.
that
being
the
case,
there's
no
reason
every
citizen
who
is
offended
by
this
shouldn't
come
in
and
express
that
view.
indeed,
we
might
have
an
800
number
linked
up
to
the
courtroom.
people
could
call
in.
more
specifically,
lawyers
and
judges
who
are
involved
in
these
cases
are
certainly
offended
by
the
facts
that
they
have
to
deal
with,
the
crime
that
they
have
to
deal
with.
it
would
seem
that
it
would
be
fair
to
call
them
in
as
also--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--here
we
have
the
testimony
of,
or
the
statements
of
the
immediate
family;
that
is,
the
mother...
excuse
me,
son,
daughter
of
the
victims...
the
actual
victims.
i
use
the
victims
in
two
words...
two
ways.
"victims"
obviously
meaning
the
murder
victims,
victims
as
included
in
this
case
included
those
people,
family
members,
who
obviously
were
upset
by
the
crime,
as
anyone
would
be,
but
were
not
present
in
any
way
at
the
crime,
and
at
whom
the
crime
was
not
actually
aimed
at.
so
that
was
what
we
had
in
this
case.
that
is
the
complaint.
the
state,
in
short--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
there
are
circumstances--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
relevant
in
a
slightly
different
way,
justice
scalia.
in
that
circumstances
it
is
a
crime.
the
crime
does
become
more
horrible,
if
it
were
not
just
the
wife,
if
it
were
just
a
citizen
that
had
to
stand
here
and
watch
this.
i
do
think
that
is
aggravating
that
you
put
someone
through
that.
so
i
think
it
is
an
aggravating
circumstance
of
the
crime,
as
opposed
to
someone
who
is
not
present
at
the
crime.
so
i
agree...
my
answer
is:
yes,
but
perhaps
for
a
slightly
different
reason
than
you
suggest.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
because
in
one
case
you
have
murder
and
in
one
attempted
murder,
except
if
there
is
the
aggravating
factor
of
capital
crime.
you
have
in
maryland
at
least
life
in
each
case.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
if
that's
true,
your
honor,
we
eliminate
reasons
for
foreseeability,
because
i
think
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
we
do
have
the
foreseeability
problem.
if
i
point
a
gun
in
a
bank
and
shoot
it,
i
surely
am
aware
that
anyone
there
may
be
injured.
i
am
not
likely
to
be
aware
that
the
victim
that
gets
hit,
for
example,
has
a
loving
family
and
children
as
opposed
to
a
victim
who
may
be
hated
by
everyone.
that's
very
unlikely
that
i'm
going
to
be
aware
of
that.
and
i
would
agree,
justice
scalia,
if
we
have
a
case,
for
example,
of
someone
saying,
"i'm
very
fond
of
mr.
smith.
"
"i've
liked
mr.
smith
for
ten
years,
but
i
hate
his
family.
"
"i'm
going
to
get
even
with
his
family
by
killing
mr.
smith.
"
well,
in
that
case
i
would
agree
that
the
circumstance
of
the
crime
is
precisely
that.
but
the
ordinary
situation
is,
there
certainly
may
be
all
these
ripple
effects,
but
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
blackness
of
the
soul
of
the
defendant,
because
the
defendant
isn't
aware,
and
in
most
instances,
to
put
it
bluntly,
is
indifferent
to
all
these
things.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
chief
justice,
i
think
one
clear
thing
is
presumably
the
defendant's
background
is
relevant,
why
he's
here.
the
victim--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--yes,
in
the
past.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
this
court
could--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
one
question
is:
does
it
have
an
effect
on
why
this
individual
committed
this
particular
crime?
certainly
defendant's
background
does.
does
it
have
any
effect
on
the
crime,
for
example,
if
one
sees
two
people
that
both
look
like
they're
from
skid
row,
shoots
one.
it
turns
out
he's
a
skid
row
person,
and
no
one
much
cares.
he
shoots
another
person,
and
it
turns
out
this
person
was
actually
a
renowned
surgeon,
and
he
happened
to
be
dressed
that
way.
and,
indeed,
probably
a
thousand
lives
will
be
lost
because
he'll
be
unable
to
be
the
surgeon
in
those
cases.
but
again--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
it
is,
justice
o'connor,
if
i
may
add
one
thing.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
that
you
would
have
reason
to
know
it
is
a
policeman
as
opposed
to
not.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
if
the
state
tied
it
to
a
knowledge
and
specific
purpose
for
doing
that.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
that's
the
question,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
difficulty
is
if
we
open
this
and
prevent
scope
of
society
arguments
is,
again,
we're
not
really
focusing
on
culpability
of
the
defendant.
it's
hard
for
the
defendant
to
be...
judge
his
culpability
in
light
of
what
not
only
he
does
not
know
in
many
cases,
but
could
not
conceivably
know.
so
that
we
have...
and
i
think
this
goes
to
the
arbitrary
factor.
we
have
two
defendants
who
have
both
acted
in
a
horrible
way,
society
would
agree.
one,
purely
by
fortuitous
circumstances,
has
caused
all
these
additional
harms,
not
because
he's
worse
or
better
than
the
other
defendant,
but
simply
by
chance.
i
think
it's
difficult
to
see
how
that
cannot
have
an
arbitrary
result,
because
we're
not
looking
at
what
this
criminal
did,
what
he
deliberately
caused
to
be
done,
but
merely
fortuitous
circumstances
of
again
the
ripple
effect
for
society.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
is
arbitrary
at
all,
your
honor,
again
because
when
i
point
the
gun
at
someone,
i
surely
must
know...
i
mean,
i
think
it's
the
basis
of
the
criminal
law--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--precisely,
judge
scalia.
i
may
have
benefited
from
that.
my
point
is:
the
defendant
who
hits
the
victim
and
is
punished
greater
can
hardly
complain
because
someone
else
missed
him.
in
that
circumstances,
both
of
them
knew,
or
should
have
known,
the
consequences.
i
surely
know,
if
i
point
a
gun
at
someone
and
i
intend
to
kill
them,
that
i
may
well
do
that.
if
i
don't,
i
may
have
been
lucky.
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
fortuitous
circumstances
in
the
sense
that
i
don't
have
control
of.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
maybe
very
unlucky.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
the
difficulty,
justice
scalia,
is
that
i
think
we're
going
to
have
to
simply
change
what
we've
said
about
criminal
law
for
at
least
the
last
200
years.
culpability
has
been
the
hallmark
of
criminal
law,
unlike
tort
law,
because
again
we're
punishing
people
for
their
bad
acts,
what
they
consciously
are
doing,
not
what
other
circumstances
may,
quite
beyond
their
acts,
cause.
if
you're
trying
to
use
this...
and
i
suppose
deterrence
is
a
factor
in
all
of
criminal
law...
if
you're
trying
to
deter
someone,
you
may
deter
someone
by
saying,
"if
this
happens,
if
you
do
this
and
you
kill
someone,
we're
going
to
punish
you
in
this
way.
"
it's
hard
to
deter
someone
by
simply
saying,
"well,
if
after
the
fact
we
decide
that
there
may
have
been
ripple
effects,
that
this
person
had
a
caring
family
as
opposed
to
an
uncaring
family--
"
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
the
question
of
outrage--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--pardon?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
i
think
that...
if
i
may...
leads
us
to
a
second
problem.
the
state
has
attempted
to
link
that
up
by
saying:
it
goes
to
retribution.
and
certainly
there
are
opinions
by
justices
of
this
court
talking
about
retribution
in
capital
punishment.
however,
those
opinions
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
capital
punishment
or
not,
not
the
procedures
to
carry
out
retribution.
and
i
think
the
point
is
significant.
for
example,
if
the
state
is
right,
and
all
i
have
to
show
is
that
this
procedure
is
consistent
with
retribution,
then
it's
obvious
that
defendant
should
be
tortured
during
sentencing.
it's
difficult
to
think
of
anything
that
could
better
serve
retribution.
or
if
one
doesn't
like
that,
one
could
at
least
bound,
gag
and
chain
him
during
it.
again,
it
serves
as
retribution.
the
point
is:
retribution
has
a
legitimate
basis,
if
one
accepts
it,
in
deciding
whether
or
not
we
apply
the
ultimate
punishment,
but
it
doesn't
help
at
all
to
say,
"is
the
procedure
fair",
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
less
fair
the
procedure,
the
greater
retribution.
if
one
uses
that
argument,
it
militates
in
favor
of
having
the
most
unfair
procedure.
and
i
think
this
may
be
an
example.
if
not
the
most
unfair
procedure,
certainly
an
unfair
one
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think,
justice
o'connor...
the
ones
i'm
familiar
with...
are
ones
where
you're
talking
about...
and
maryland
has
that,
too,
of
killing
more
than
one
person.
but,
once
again,
the
defendant
certainly
knows--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--again,
i
can't
say
that
i'm
completely
familiar
with
every
other
statute,
other
than
maryland's,
but
i
believe
those
are
again
to
be
tied--
for
example,
if
you
put
a
bomb
in
this
building,
surely
one
knows
that
the
chances
of
killing
more
than
one
person
are
very,
very
great.
and
again
i
think
that
is
easy
to
tie
to
foreseeability,
as
opposed
to
the
situation
where
no
one
can
possibly
foresee.
so
i'm
learning
my
answer,
because
i'm
not
terribly
familiar
with
all
these
statutes,
but
i
think
you
can
distinguish
them
in
that
way.
a
word
perhaps
should
be
said
about,
in
passing,
the
state's
use
of
authority.
the
state,
not
unreasonably,
has
combed
the
country
for
those
cases
which
best
support
its
position--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--that
may
be
reasonably
likelihood,
reasonable
likelihood
that
someone
may
be.
but
again
you
don't
know
how
extreme,
and
there
are
going
to
be
extremes.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
and
i
think
there
are
several
perhaps
additional
problems
with
this,
because
not
only
are
we
talking
about
leaving
these
victims,
we're
also
talking
about
a
very
personalized
thing.
for
example,
let's
suppose
that
there
are
two
murders.
and
in
one
case...
they
both
have
loving
families.
but
some
people,
their
grief
just
as
intense,
would
prefer
not
to
participate,
would
prefer
not
to
be
involved
in
this.
they
want
certainly
justice,
but
they
also
want
to
not
be
involved.
so
they're
not
going
to
have
much
in
the
victim
impact
statement.
they
may
say,
"no,
we're
not
going
to
be
involved.
"
the
other
case,
the
people
may...
their
grief
may
take
the
opposite
view.
but
once
again
here,
not
only
do
we
have
fortuitous
circumstances
in
where
there
are
family
members,
but
it
turns
on
the
specific
reaction
of
the
family
members,
rather
than
the
actual
victim
or
the
defendant.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
certainly
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
a
difference.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
certainly
agree
with
you
that
the
family
could
successfully
sue
the
killer.
i
have
no
difficulty
with
that
whatsoever.
i
think
in
our
brief
we
make
clear,
one
of
the
early
divisions
between
tort
law
and
criminal
law
was
just
that,
is
to
take
the
victim
as
you
find
the
situation.
and
the
idea,
obviously,
of
tort
law
is
to
put
people,
make
people
whole
to
the
extent
you
can.
obviously,
realistically
in
this
case,
you
can't;
but
to
the
extent
that
you
can.
and
so
i'm
certainly
not
suggesting
that
you
couldn't
sue
in
tort,
but--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
that
obviously
this
court
can
do
as
it
will,
but
i
think
to
do
that,
we're
going
to
have
to
substitute
tort
law
for
criminal
law.
criminal
law
has
never
been
built
on
that
basis.
and
i
think
the
reason
mr.
chief
justice
has
to
draw
all
the
the
analogy
from
tort
law
is
precisely
that.
it's
not
criminal
law.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--as
always--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
would
say
if
you
reasonably--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i'm
just...
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
case.
i
don't
know
if
your
honor
has
one
in
mind.
i
think,
for
example,
let's...
the
situation...
i
don't...
this
is
not
a
federal
case.
it
was
a
maryland
case
where
you
have
someone
posing
as
a
drug
dealer.
and
i
think
in
that
situation,
it's
very
difficult
to
argue
is,
when
someone
is
being
killed
in
a
drug
transaction
because
he's
posing
as
a
drug...
drug
dealer,
that
you're
actually
killing
a
federal
officer
because
it
doesn't
serve
that
purpose
of--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
it's
reasonableness...
is
if
everyone
realizes
that
banks,
most
banks
perhaps,
many
banks,
are
federal
banks,
is
if
someone
is
deliberately
posing
as
a
drug
dealer,
i
don't
think
one
can
reasonably
say,
"i
must,
therefore,
assume--
"
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--they
realize
that.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
the
difficulty
is--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--presumably
his
mother...
it
may
been
her
fault.
i
don't
know
that
it
is.
that
may
have
some
bearing
on
what
he
did.
what
he
did
was
certainly
not
because
and
not
intended,
in
the
normal
situation,
to
these
other
individuals.
and
it's
very
difficult,
justice
scalia,--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think,
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
in
part
i
agree
with
you.
but
i
think
it's
foreseeable
harm,
not
unforeseeable
harm.
i
think
that's
the
only
difference
i
have
with
you--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i'm
saying...
i
said,
justice
marshall,--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--now,
justice,
we've
changed
that
in
maryland.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
i
think
this
all
is
the
question
of
admissibility
comes
down
to,
whether
it
serves
one
of
these
purposes.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
powell.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
by
agreement
of
all
the
parties,
the
preferred...
the
options
given
the
defense
in
this
case
were,
you
can
have
live
or
statements.
by
agreements,
they
thought
it
was
less
prejudicial
than
you
had
the
statements.
so
the
answer
is,
they
didn't
cross-examine
him.
but
i
can't
honestly
say,
obviously,
that's
because
of
the
procedure.
it
was
because
the
procedure
that
the
parties
agreed
that
it
would
be
less
prejudicial
than
for
statements.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
don't
understand,
justice
powell.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
yes,
justice.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
no.
they
were
not
there,
no.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
that's
true.
they...
i
think
they
could
have.
as
i
pointed
out,
justice
powell,
in
this
case,
all
the
parties...
well,
obviously,
defense
didn't
want
any
victim
impact
statement.
the
response
was,
"well,
is...
would
you
prefer
us
to
have
live
victims
or
the
statement?
"
and
i
think
defense
counsel
made
that
choice.
obviously,
if
they
would
have
come,
i
see
no
reason
why
they
could
not
be
cross-examined
in
that
circumstance.
i
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
initially,
one
technical
problem:
the
state,
very
confidently,
has
said
the
maryland
statute
doesn't
matter
whether
you
know
it's
a
police
officer
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals
has
disagreed
with
that
in
a
case
cited
by
the
state
and
in
the
briefs...
i
won't
give
you
the
cite...
the
court
of
appeals
did
think
it
mattered--
so
i
don't
think
that
it
supports
the
state's
position
whatsoever.
also,--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
in
the
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--unless
you
knew
reasonably...--
0
xxx.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
lodowski
versus
state
just
cites
in
the
state's
brief...
it's
302
md.
691.
so
that
has
been
decided
in
a
contrary
way.
i
think
it
was
intriguing
that
the
state
took
the
position
that,
to
justice
stevens'
question,
that
you
could
have
an
aggravating
factor
that
a
defendant
had
children,
three
children
presumably.
well,
if
that's
true,
i
think
you
can
go
a
step
farther.
and
under
this
theory
is,
for
example,
we
could
say,
it's
an
aggravating
factor
if
you
have
four,
not
it
you
have
two.
or
perhaps,
if
we
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
that
people
didn't
have
children
and
wanted
to
control
our
population,
presumably
the
state
could
under
those
circumstances
say,
then
it's
only
an
aggravating
factor
if
there
are
no
children.
in
short,
i
think
what
the
state's
done
is
point
out
the
completely
arbitrary
nature
of
these
things
that
have
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
crime
itself.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
all
the
other
aggravating
factors
are
things
that
are
focusing
on
precisely
what
the
defendant
did.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
how
evil--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--one,
and
two,
whether
what
he
did
was
foreseeable.
i
don't
suggest
that
it's
only
evil--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
and
i
think,
absent
that,
we
simply
have
no
way
to
introduce
anything
but
the
most
arbitrary
standard.
and
we're
not,
again,
focusing
on...
particularly
pointing
out
those
particularly
bad
individuals
that
we
want
to
execute,
we're
going
to
pinpoint
those
individuals
who
may,
through...
the
fault
obviously
is
theirs
to
the
crime...
but
in
terms
of
all
these
other
circumstances,
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
they
were
thinking
or
what
they
knew.
and,
indeed,
it
may
turn
out--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
i
disagree.
i've
never
suggested
that
was
arbitrary.
on
the
contrary,
i
think
it's--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
it's
fairly
easy
when
you
look
at
the
situation.
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
be
in
the
situation
of
trying
to
murder
someone
and
not
realize
either
it's
going
to
be
attempt
or
murder.
i
have
complete
control
over
that.
i
don't
see
how
i
can
possibly
argue
that
that's
arbitrary.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
have
no
control
over
whether
he
does.
as
the
state
pointed
out,
the
defendant
in
this
case,
probably
in
any
case,
is
unconcerned.
that
may
be
callous,
but
it
also
doesn't
show
evil
heart
in
that,
i
want
to
punish
this
person's
children;
i
want
to
make
his
family...
it
may
be
that
i
would
introduce
evidence
that
maybe
the
defendant
would
say
to
someone,
"i
committed
this
crime;
perhaps,
i
shouldn't
have,
but
i
really
hope
that
he
had
no
family
and
no
children.
"
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
as
i
pointed
out,
justice
scalia,
if
we
accept
that,
if
we
accept
that,
then
i
think
it
becomes
reasonable
to
weigh
is,
who
is
this
victim
in
the
community?
was
he
the
surgeon
that's
going
to
save
a
thousand
lives?
or
was
he
the
drug
dealer
who,
perhaps,
was
going
to
eliminate
lives?
are
we
going
to
have
a
system
that's
going
to
turn
on:
some
lives
are
worth
giving
more
protection
to
than
others,
because
that's
really
what
it
comes
down
to.
it
isn't
that
the
defendant's
chooses
to
kill
the
surgeon
as
opposed
to
the
drug
dealer.
it
happens
that
way.
and
the
question
is:
is
the
society...
are
we,
as
a
society,
prepared
at
this
point
to
say,
"well,
some
victims,
we
really
don't
care
that
much
about,
so
we
wouldn't
consider
capital
punishment.
"
"there
are
other
victims
that
we
care
a
great
deal
about
because
they
had
nice
families.
"
as
opposed
to
the
person,
for
example,
who
is
a
very
unpleasant
person
and
has
impatient
heirs.
presumably
in
the
logic
of
the
thing,
the
probation
officer
should
come
in
and
say,
"this
is
favorable.
"
"you
should
never
give
death
to
this
person
because
he
was
a
terrible
person;
his
heirs
are
happy;
the
impact
is
good.
"
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
but
justice
scalia,--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--the
difficulty
is
how
can
you
get
away
with
that--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--how
can
you
get
away
from
that
is:
if
i
have
a
family
that's
loving,
caring,
articulate,
and
upset
as
opposed
to:
do
i
have
a
family
that
doesn't
care
very
much
for
me,
doesn't
even
mildly
like
me.
it
comes
down
to--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--you're
right,
justice
stevens,
if
that's
the
case.
i'm
sorry...--

mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
have
disagreement
on
that
issue.
thank
you.
