justice
white
do
i
understand
that
the
maryland
statute
authorizes
imposing
the
death
penalty
just
because
the
jury
hears
and
believes
the
statements
of
victim...
of
relatives?
justice
white
you
have
to
find
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
white
and
so
there's
no...
there's
no
separate
aggravating
circumstance
for
victim
impact...
of
impact
on
victims?
justice
white
before
you,
the
blue
brief,
the
last
pages
of
the
blue
brief--
justice
white
--is...
down
there
in
roman
numeral...
roman
numeral
five
and
six,
are
those
the...
is
that
the
only...
are
those
the
only
mentions
of
the
family
members?
justice
white
and
in
six,
it
says...
in
five,
it
says
the
statement
must
contain
any
request
for
psychological
services
by
the
victim's
family.
justice
white
and
in
six,
it
says
any
other
information
about
the
victim's
family
that
the
court
requires.
justice
white
was
there
some
requirement
by
the
court
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
this
seems
to
indicate
that
the
judge
has
to
require
information
about
the
impact
on
the
victim's
family.
justice
white
does
the
judge
ever
instruct
with
respect
to
a
victim
impact
statement,
what
its
relevance
is,
or
how
it
should
be
used?
justice
white
does
he
ever?
justice
white
does
he
ever?
justice
white
but
you
don't
recall
any
instance
where
the
judge
did
comment
on
it?
justice
white
but
you
know...
you
know
what
a
prosecutor
says
about
it,
doesn't
he...
don't
you?
justice
white
and
so
then
argued
from
what?
justice
white
and,
therefore,
it
helped
to
illuminate
what
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
white
what
aggravating
circumstance
did
the
jury
find
in
this
case?
justice
white
is
that
the
only
one?
justice
white
now
how
did
a
victim
impact
statement,
how
could
that
have
illuminated
that?
justice
white
it
may
have...
did
they
ask
for...
for
the
especially
heinous,
aggravating--
justice
white
--circumstance?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
you
may
include
it
in...
in
your
consideration
of...
of
how
serious
a
crime
this
was?
the
more
serious
it
is,
the
more
what?
justice
white
well,
when
the
prosecutor
is
asking
for
the
death
penalty
and
as
he's
trying
to
get
it,
he
uses
this
because
he
thinks
it
will
help
him
attain
that
goal;
doesn't
he?
justice
white
that
the
probation
officer,
does
he
prepare
the--
justice
white
--and
if
he
finds
out
that
the
children
of
the
victim
think
that
it
was
good
riddance,
he
puts
that
in
the
report,
too?
justice
white
does
he?
justice
white

xxx.
--is
it
a
defense?
justice
white
you
cannot
be
convicted
for
killing
an
officer
unless
you
knew
he
was
an
officer?
justice
white
that's
what
the
holding
was?
