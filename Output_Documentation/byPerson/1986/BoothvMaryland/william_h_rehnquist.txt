chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
this
afternoon
in
no.
86-5020,
john
booth
against
maryland.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
burns.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
exactly
was
introduced
in
evidence
here,
mr.
burns?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
why
is
the
blackness
of
the
soul
of
the
defendant,
as
you
and
justice
scalia
have
been
saying,
the
only
thing
that
the
state
may
produce
evidence
about?
certainly
our
cases
have
given
the
broadest
latitude
to
the
defendant,
to
show
anything
in
the
defendant's
background
that
may
make
the
jury
have
a
feel
for
and
be
sympathetic
to
him.
why
can't
the
state
at
the
same
time
be
entitled
to
make
the
victim
human
and
make
the
family
human,
to
get
across
to
the
jury
just
what
the
impact
of
this
act
was?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
court
has
said
it
was
relevant.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
presumably
this
court
could
say
the
victims
were
relevant.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
question
is:
what
reason
supporting
one
doesn't
support
the
other?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
any
more
arbitrary
than
justice
scalia's
example
of
the
attempted
murderer
who
aims
for
the
forehead,
misses
and
gets
ten
years,
as
opposed
to
the
man
who
hits
and
is
executed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
burns,
hasn't
tort
law
for
a
long
time
distinguished
between
intentional
torts
and
negligent
torts
in
this
respect,
that
with
respect
to
intentional
torts,
you
take
the
consequences
as
you
find
them,
and
you're
responsible
for
even
fairly
unforeseeable
consequences.
it's
just
in
the
negligence
areas
that
the
foreseeability
question
comes
in.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
an
intentional
killer
is
really
not
in
a
position
as
applying
traditional
tort
laws
to
complain
that
he
killed
someone
who
had
a
far
more
bereaved
family
than
the
next
person.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you're
insisting
that
there's
a
foreseeable...
a
principle
of
foreseeability
here
that
should
somehow
limit
your
client's
criminal
liability.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
suggesting
that
that...
that
there's
a
very
good
analogy
from
tort
law
that
suggests
that
isn't
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
burns.
we'll
hear
now
from
you
mr.
monk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
monk.
mr.
burns,
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
burns.
the
case
is
submitted.
