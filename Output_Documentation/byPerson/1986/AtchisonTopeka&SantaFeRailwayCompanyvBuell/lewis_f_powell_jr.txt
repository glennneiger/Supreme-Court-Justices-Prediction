justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
lee,
before
you
proceed,
it
would
help
me
if
you
would
tell
me
what
relief
could
be
awarded
respondents
under
the
fela.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
they
award
damages?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
lee,
do
you
define
what
place
to
include
the
entire
railroad?
you
refer
to
the
workplace.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
if
you
had
an
engineer
who
was
alleged
to
be
abusive
of
other
people
working
with
him
on
a
particular
train
you
would
take
the
same
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
really
your
argument
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
the
nature
of
the
injury
is
emotional
distress
rather
than
physical
injury.
suppose
when
they
used
to
have
firemen
on
trains
that
the
firemen
beat
up
the
engineer
in
a
physical
encounter.
would
that
be
under...
which
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
under
the
fela?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
the
big
issue
in
this
case,
is
a
distinction
between
physical
and
emotional
injury,
regardless
of
where
it
took
place.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
mccall,
in
light
of
what
you
have
been
saying
recently,
may
we
ignore
the
fact
that
your
brief
alleges
physical
injury?
at
the
bottom
of
page
12
of
your
brief
you
state
that
buell
suffered
physical
injury
as
well
as
severe
mental
breakdown
and
that
the
harassment
causing
his
injuries
included
physical
contact
and
common
law
assault.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
we
ignore
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
does
the
record
prove
what
you
say
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
where
is
it?
that
is
what
i
am
interested
in.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
where
do
i
find
that
deposition?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
appendix?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
have
the
page
by
chance?
i
don't
want
to
detain
your
argument.
well,
it
is
in
the
deposition?
is
the
deposition
in
the
record
that
has
been
lodged
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
we
may
ignore
that
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
this
case.
you
rely
eventually
on
what
the
courts
below
described
as
emotional
injury.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
the
burden
on
you
or
your
opponent
at
the
summary
judgment
motion
stage
in
this
case
to
produce
this
evidence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
railroad
have
that
evidence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
burden
was
on
the
railroad
to
prove
that
there
was
physical
injury?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
not
the
way
i
always
saw
summary
judgment
operate,
but
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
the
workmen's
compensation
laws
of
the
states
provide
for
purely
emotional
injury?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
would
be
my
impression.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
fela
was
enacted
to
provide,
as
i
think
you
have
indicated,
special
privileges
for
railway
employees.
the
brotherhoods
have
always
opposed
workmen's
compensation
laws.
