mr.
james
r.
mc
call
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
my
privilege
to
address
you
today
as
counsel
of
record
for
jim
buell,
a
veteran
railroad
worker
of
over
ten
years'
employment
with
the
santa
fe
railroad
who
in
october
of
1981
sustained
a
severe
and
grievous
injury.
of
that
there
can
be
no
doubt.
certainly
the
primary
aspect
of
his
injury
was
psychiatric.
he
was
confined
to
a
psychiatric
ward
in
st.
joseph's
hospital
in
stockton,
california,
for
17
days.
for
six
months
he
was
on
psychiatric
medication.
over
a
year
on
psychotherapy
before
he
could
go
back
to
work.
his
admitting
physician,
psychiatrist
robert
austin,
said
the
man
suffered
a
severe
psychotic
illness
related
to
pressures
on
the
job.
the
injury,
we
submit,
was
grave.
santa
fe's
position
in
the
lower
court
was
simply
that
because
the
facts
or
some
of
the
facts
that
were
necessarily
alleged
in
the
fela
action
involved
a
dispute
or
controversy
or
friction
if
you
will
between
mr.
wright
and
his
foreman,
mr.
buell,
pardon
me,
mr.
buell
and
his
foreman,
mr.
wright,
that
mr.
buell
was
precluded
and
unable
to
use
the
fela
as
a
vehicle
to
attain
redress
for
the
injuries
he
suffered.
now,
that
position
has
altered
in
this
court.
now
the
focus
has
been
more
on
the
fact
that
psychiatric
injury
is
the
primary
ill
or
grievance
that
mr.
buell
suffered
in
october.
the
santa
fe
position,
i
think,
needs
some
elaboration
by
me
on
the
facts.
basically
mr.
buell
had
worked
for
santa
fe
for
ten
years
before
mr.
wright
became
his
foreman.
friction
developed
between
the
two
some
time
after
mr.
wright
became
foreman
in
the
fall
of
1979.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
justice,
the
affidavits...
it
is
clear
in
the
buell
brief
that
i
put
in,
we
did
not
marshall
facts
showing
physicality
in
the
lower
court
because
the
thrust
of
santa
fe's
argument
there
was
that
it
made
no
difference
what
type
of
injury
was
involved.
their
sole
focus
was
the
source
of
the
injury
was
something
that
could
have
been
grieved.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
again
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
we
should
be
able
to
point
to
things
that
are
in
the
record
that
were
not
produced
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
simply
because
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
rather
narrow.
it
was
directed
solely
to
a
point
of
law,
to
wit,
and
it
is
hard
for
me
to
state
it
because
it
is
hard
to
get
a
grip
on
it,
mr.
buell
is
precluded
in
santa
fe's
eyes
in
the
lower
court
from
stating
an
fela
cause
of
action
because
some
of
the
facts
he
alleged
involve
a
grievable
dispute
regardless
of
the
injury.
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
basically
met
on
the
basis
of
a
point
of
law.
they
are
saying
no,
the
fela
is
not
precluded
by
the
rla.
the
fact
that
something
could
be
grieved
does
not
mean
that
you
lose
a
right
to
bring
an
fela
action
it
an
injury
results.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
that
is
correct,
justice,
yes,
and
i
won't...
the
point
as
to
the
physicality,
the
physical
causation,
the
physical
consequence,
the
gastritis,
the
common
law
battery,
if
you
will,
those
items
are
developed
in
my
brief
at
pages
33
through
40
and
i
won't
refer
to
them
again.
in
any
event--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--it
was
one
of
the
fellow
workmen,
a
man
named
williams.
there
was
pushing
and
shoving.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
that
is
in
the
record.
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
developed
in
my
brief
at
the
pages
i
indicated.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
the
damages...
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
was
that
he
suffered
physical
and
emotional
distress,
but
it
is
clear--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--gastritis.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
the
gastritis,
and
certainly--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--yes,
your
honor,
very
definitely.
the
point
i
want
to
make,
and
i
will
sum
up
my
factual
recitation
here
rather
quickly,
is
that
the
dispute
as
to
the
work
orders,
as
to
whether
or
not
wright
was
asking
buell
to
perform
an
illegal
act
in
helping
him
remove
santa
fe
plywood
and
such
into
wright's
truck
so
he
could
take
it
home.
that
was
really
resolved
long
before
this
course
of
conduct
about
which
we
really
complain.
there
was
a...
this
was
really
resolved
prior
to
the
grievance
meeting
that
was
held
in
which
large
numbers
of
men
in
the
stockton
yard
complained
through
their
union
representative
about
the
abusive,
harassing
techniques
of
this
foreman,
mr.
wright.
now,
santa
fe
chose
to
respond
to
that
grievance
by
doing
nothing.
they
didn't
take
mr.
wright
off
the
job
and
they
didn't
change
his
conduct.
at
least
that
is
what
the
record
shows.
yes,
justice.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
if
you
approach
it
as
a
grievance,
but,
justice
scalia,
under
the
fela
congress
was
very
clear
about
wanting
to
make
the
master
responsible
for
the
acts
of
the
fellow
servants
in
the
workplace,
in
the
railroad
workplace,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
fela
imposes
a
duty
on
santa
fe
to
take
reasonable
steps
to
see
that
their
foremen
do
not
abuse
their
workmen,
so
in
that
sense
it
seems
to
me
a
classic
fela
case.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
that
is
our
position.
the
particular
quotation
from
the
house
report
on
the
fela
in
1908
that
supports
this,
and
it
is
very,
very
clear
on
the
notion
that
congress
wanted
the
master
to
police,
if
you
will,
the
acts
of
the
servants
so
they
didn't
injure
one
another
appears
at
page
42
in
the
buell
brief.
after
the
grievance
proceeding
which
santa
fe
chose
to
take
no
action
on,
there
was
a
letter
by
the
union
representative,
mr.
pickleman,
who
was
a
supervisor
overseeing
the
work
of
mr.
wright
on
june
6th
saying
the
men
are
still
complaining
about
the
intimidation
and
harassment
and
the
tactics
that
mr.
wright
uses
in
running
the
work
crew.
after
this,
there
was
harassment
directed
to
mr.
buell
that
is
outlined
in
the
buell
brief
and
there
is
no
need
to
go
into
it,
but
that
is
the
course
of
activity
of
which
mr.
buell
complains,
really,
the
harassment,
the
intimidation,
and
the
acts
after
the
grievance
proceeding.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
offer
an
analogy
which
i
think
is
somewhat
helpful
to
clarify
the
difference
between
the
santa
fe
position
and
ours.
if
you
assume
that
you
had
a
dangerous
foreman,
a
foreman
who
was
sadistic,
clearly
that
would
be
a
grievable
matter.
the
workers,
workmen
under
the
foremen
could
grieve
it,
they
could
get
the
union
representative
in
and
they
could
present
the
issue
to
santa
fe.
if
santa
fe
chose
to
take
no
action
and
a
number
of
months
went
by
and
the
foreman
then
became
infuriated
with
one
of
the
men
on
the
job
who
had
complained
about
his
activities
previously
and
brought
a
gun
onto
the
worksite
and
shot
that
workman
we
contend
there
would
be
no
conceivable
way
that
the
fela
would
not
give
a
cause
of
action
to
the
foreman.
now,
to
bring
it
much
closer
to
this
case
and
make
it
almost
all
fours
on
mr.
buell's
complaint,
if
we
assume
that
after
the
nonproductive
grievance
the
foreman
some
months
later
becomes
infuriated
with
one
of
the
men
who
complained
about
his
conduct
as
a
foreman,
brings
a
gun
onto
the
worksite,
but
the
gun
isn't
loaded,
but
of
course
the
worker
does
not
know
that,
and
the
foreman
points
it
at
the
worker
and
pulls
the
trigger
and
it
just
goes
click.
now,
in
that
situation
let's
further
assume
that
the
workman
in
fear
of
his
life
has
a
psychiatric
event,
and
has
a
psychiatric
breakdown.
that,
i
submit,
is
very,
very
close
to
the
exact
facts
that
we
have
in
this
case,
and
i
doubt
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
preclude
or
shut
the
federal
courthouse
doors
to
that
workman
when
he
wanted
to
come
in
and
try
and
make
his
proofs
to
the
court
under
the
fela.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
justice.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
he
would
be,
your
honor,
if
and
only
if
he
had
suffered
an
injury.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
as
far
as
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures
are
concerned,
what
the
foreman
did
did
not
violate
any
term
of
the
contract.
that
would
be
to
put
the
arbitration--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--oh,
i
certainly
could,
your
honor.
yes,
i
would.
it
would
be
just
like
the
mcdonald
case
that
this
court
decided
unanimously
in
1985.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
i
can't
see
how
arbitration
or
grievance
is
an
adequate
substitute
for
the
federal
district
court
jury
trial
right
that
the
congress
gave
under
the
fela.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
the
time
limits
on
grievance
are
rather
severe.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
so
it
wouldn't
arise,
i
suppose.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
i
didn't
speak
well
on
that,
justice
scalia.
the
matter
would
be
grievable.
the
foreman's
conduct
would
be
grievable.
there
is
no
doubt
of
that.
but
once
a
workman
is
injured,
then
the
worker
has
the
right
to
go
to
the
fela
and
recover...
pardon
me,
sue
under
the
fela,
the
federal
district
court,
and
recover
for
the
injury.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
well,
there
is
the
common
law
duty
or
the
duty
that
the
fela
recognizes
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
not
to
be
negligent
in
the
way
in
which
its
fellow
servants
treat
each
other.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
justice.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
the
elgin
case
in
a
long...
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so,
justice.
the
elgin
case
in
a
long,
discursive
conversation
talks
about
major
disputes,
minor
disputes,
and
in
an
offhand
way
says
that
minor
disputes
may
include
personal
injury
actions.
elgin
in
1945
is
premised
on
the
mohr
case
in
1940
which
said
that
rla
grievance
arbitration
procedures
are
not
exclusive,
they
are
just
optional.
a
worker
could
go
in
and
pursue
a
grievance
or
a
worker
could
go
to
court.
so
elgin,
as
i
attempt
to
point
out
in
my
brief
and
as
the
afl-cio
in
their
amicus
brief
stresses,
elgin
is
premised
on
the
idea
that
the
rla
is
not...
the
arbitrable
procedures
under
rla
are
not
exclusive.
this
court
in
andrews
held
that
they
were
in
1972.
so
in
that
elgin
used
loose
language
and
talked
in
terms
of
personal
injuries
being
grievable
matters
i
don't
think
it
is
controlling
at
this
point.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
but
i--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--yes,
indeed,
justice.
that
is
exactly
our
point,
that
the
fela,
like
1983,
like
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
was
involved
in
barentine,
these
are
individual
rights
given
to
individual
workers,
actions
by
unions
representing
workers
under
arbitration
procedures
can't
preclude
or
in
any
way
affect
those
rights.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
that
is
our
basic
position,
your
honor,
and
we
offer
it
as
one
of
three
ways
we
feel
that
there
can
be
harmonization
between
the
fela
and
the
rla.
i
attempt
to
do
that
in
our
brief.
i
don't
have
the
page
reference
here
but
the
three
options
we
offer
are,
the
first
that
you
have
mentioned,
and
that
is
the
preferred
option
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
that
is
the
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
took.
once
you
have
an
injury
you
don't
have
an
rla
matter
any
more.
you
could
go
back
and...
certainly
you
could
always
grieve,
whether
or
not
mr.
wright
is
a
proper
foreman.
he
could
try
and
get
the
company
to--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--yes.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
it
is
unlikely
a
lawsuit
is
going
to
be
brought
for
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
conceivably
someone
could
bring
a
lawsuit
for
that,
yes.
that
is
correct,
and
when
mr.
lee
mentions
we
have
got
to
have
some
way
of
distinguishing
between
these
two
statutes
i
say
congress
has
already
done
it.
congress
has
said
when
you
have
an
injury
to
any
employee
that
is
the
result
of
negligence,
then
you
have
an
fela
action.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
justice.
yes,
that
definitely
would
be
the
case.
i
can't
think
of
anything
that
wouldn't
be
a
personal
injury
that
railroad
negligence
in
the
workplace
would
produce--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
justice.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
i
would.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
that
it
would
be
medically
identifiable
and
under
the
general
tort
rules
you
could
satisfy
causation
which
is
going
to
be
a
problem
in
emotional
injury,
but
it
is
a
problem
also
in
back
injuries,
which
are
rather
common
under
fela.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
pardon
me,
justice?
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
i
would
say
that--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--yes,
your
honor.
it
is
enough
in
many,
many
states--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--it
is
conceivable
that
that
could
do
it,
although
one
would
think
that
usually
it
would
take
more
than
that
and
a
consistent
course
of--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--if
so,
i
don't
know
it
at
this
time,
your
honor.
some
of
the
treatise
writers
mention
cases
going
back
into
the
19th
century
where
emotional
distress
was--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--then
mr.
buell
certainly
has
a
hard
case
to
bring
then
because
that
would
be...
as
a
bottom
line,
emotional
injury
has
to
be
compensable
under
the
fela
and
has
to
be
recognized
as
an
injury.
in
more
direct
response
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
i
have
no
idea
what
was
in
the
collective
intention
of
congress
in
1908
except
i
do
know
that
they
intended
to
treat
railroad
workers
as
almost
a
privileged
class,
a
protected
class,
to
give
them
the
right
to
bring
actions
when
they
were
injured
that
no
other
worker
had
1908.
congress
did
away--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--oh,
certainly
that
was
the
background,
but
i
submit
that
this
court
in
urie
versus
mcdonald
in
1949
took
this
direct
issue
on
and
gave
to
me
what
would
be
a
guiding
precedent
for
that
case.
in
urie
you
had
a
railroad
worker
who
had
suffered
silicosis,
which,
of
course,
is
abrasion
of
the
lungs
through
breathing
in
cold
dust.
now,
that
had
gone
on
for
a
long
period
of
time.
the
negligence
would
be
clear.
the
railroad
should
have
provided
a
safe
work
place
where
this
worker
was
not
subjected
to
that.
he
brought
suit
when
the
silicosis
manifest
itself
and
he
could
no
longer
work.
the
railroad
defended
by
saying
congress
only
intended
in
1908
to
protect
workers
from
sudden
grievous
accidents,
the
sort
of
thing

worker
gets
run
overt
the
sort
of
terrible
accidents
that
clearly
congress
had
in
mind.
that
was
the
background.
this
court
said,
no,
we
will
not
give
a
cramped,
constrained
limitation
to
the
word
"injury".
any
injury
that
is
compensable
under
evolving
tort
notions
is
going
to
be
considered
an
injury
for
purposes
of
the
fela.
now,
that
is
consistent
with
the
notion
that
we
want
in
the
fela
the
master
to
control
the
acts
of
the
servants,
we
want
the
safest
possible
workplace
for
the
people
to
do
the
very
hard
and
dangerous
work
of
building
and
maintaining
the
railroads.

the
common

assault,

this
occurred
during
the
course
of
conduct
leading
up
to
the
psychiatric
breakdown.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
in
essence,
that
is
correct.
the
physical
injury
that
the
man
suffered,
the
gastritis,
was
a
product
of
a
psychiatric
event
of
real
significance.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
right,
there
are
no
bruises
or
contusions.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
and
some
courts
have
been
more
willing
to
grant
relief
for
emotional
distress
or
psychiatric
injury
when
there
has
been
accompanying
physical
harm
because
of
a
concern
about
was
there
really
something
happened
or
something
that
was
really
suffered
by
the
plaintiff
in
prosser
and
the
other
hornbooks.
i
was
pointing
out
that
there
are
elements
of
this
in
the
record.
they
were
not
produced
and
marshalled
for
the
purpose
of
the
summary
judgment
motion
because
the
summary
judgment
motion
was
solely
based
on
the
idea
that
the
fela
can
have
no
application
here
for
either
physical
or
mental
injuries
because
it
is
an
rla
matter.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
we
submit
it
was
on...
it
was
not
on
us
to
produce
the
evidence.
we
submit--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--the
railroad
had
taken
the
depositions,
yes.
and
they
had
the
letters
from
the
doctors.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
no.
no,
your
honor.
what
the
railroads
should
have
done
in
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
to
say
that
mr.
buell
has
no
cause
of
action
here
because
he
alleges
only
emotional
injury.
if
that
had
been
the
case
then
mr.
buell
would
have
responded
and
brought
out
that
there
was
more
than
emotional
injury.
there
was
accompanying
physical
harm,
which
has
been
important
to
some
courts,
but
the
railroad
did
not
do
that.
santa
fe
didn't
do
that.
they
just
said
no--
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
--certainly.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
i
have
not
researched
that
thoroughly,
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
many
do
not.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
california
does
not.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes.
one
point
that
i
did
want
to
make
was
the
anomalous
situation
that
would
occur
were
this
court
to
accept
the
argument
of
santa
fe
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
mr.
buell,
because
he
suffered
only
emotional
injury,
must
grieve
his
matter
and
cannot
go
through
the
fela
doors
to
the
federal
court.
as
a
product
of
the
grievance
and
arbitration
process
he
could
not
recover
damages
for
the
suffering
that
he
has
incurred.
he
couldn't
get
damages
for
his
lost
future
earnings.
he
would
be
without
a
remedy.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
there
may
be
some
for
outrageous
conduct
but,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
problem
with
relegating
these
kinds
of
injuries
to
state
law
would
be
a
lack
of
uniformity
in
application
to
the
railroads.
we
would
have
a
situation
where
if
the
state
of
nevada...
well,
the
state
of
california
does
acknowledge
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
and
the
fela
has
been
interpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
1960
to
allow
it,
as
i
point
out
in
the
brief,
for
25
years.
if
you
had
workmen
in
the
position
of
mr.
buell
relegated
to
state
law,
then
if
california
allowed
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
but
nevada
did
not,
and
you
had
a
situation
where
a
railroad
worker
was
going
back
and
forth
between
the
two
states,
then
you
get
into
some
terrible
conflicts
about
it
or
questions,
and
it
is
very,
very
hard
for
the
railroad
to
operate,
i
would
think,
knowing
what
it
has
to
counsel
its
foremen
to
avoid,
just
what
sort
of
steps
it
has
to
take
to
see
that
things
don't
happen
such
as
happened
in
this
case.
so
i
would
think
that
national
uniformity
would
mean
that
those
state
causes
of
action
should
be
preempted
and
the
fela
should
be...
allow
for
actions
purely
for
solely
psychiatric
injury.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
just
once
again
say
that
it
is
our
position
that
the
fela,
because
of
the
acknowledged
humane
and
humanitarian
and
remedial
aspects
of
the
statute
as
recognized
by
this
court
speaks
to
us
today
simply
because
the
idea
that
emotional
distress
was
not
cognizable
in
most
states
in
1908
should
not
preclude
federal
courts
from
being
able
to
recognize
the
evolving
law
of
torts
and
if
there
is
any
bright
line
needed
between
the
rla
and
the
fela
it
is
fact
of
injury.
once
that
occurs,
then
the
worker
has
a
right
to
go
to
federal
court
in
our
position.
thank
you.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
by
and
large.
some
states
do
allow
negligent
infliction.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
by
and
large.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
would
point
out
one
thing.
in
the
mcmillan
case
in
1960
the
california
supreme
court
when
presented
with
this
specific
issue
held
that
suffering
purely
psychiatric
injury
as
a
result
of
carrying
out
work
orders
from
a
railroad
was
compensable
under
fela,
relying
very
heavily
on
this
court's
decision
in
urie,
the
language
in
urie,
the
language
of
the
fela,
and
the
legislative
history,
and
in
california
there
has
been
no
evidence
that
has
been
brought
to
anyone's
attention
that
there
have
been
spurious
claims
or
that
artful
pleading
has
somehow
defeated
the
will
of
congress.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
and
there
was
an
injury.
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
adequate.
an
allegation
of
negligence
which
was
made
in
this
case
does
focus
on
the
idea
that
the
railroad
did
not
act
reasonably.
mr.
james
r.
mc
call
i
think
the
language
of
section
51
does
indicate
that.
