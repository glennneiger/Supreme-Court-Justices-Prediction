mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
statutory
construction
case.
there
are
two
statutes
to
be
construed
and
they
are
the
two
that
govern
relations
between
employers
and
employees
in
the
railroad
industry.
on
the
one
hand,
the
railway
labor
act
provides
for
exclusive
mandatory
nonjudicial
resolution
of
so-called
minor
disputes
which
the
act
defines
as
all
disputes
growing
out
of
grievances
or
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
bargaining
agreements.
the
basic
objective
of
this
minor
dispute
part
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
to
assure
that
workplace
controversies
would
be
resolved
by
persons
who
were
expert
in
railroad
matters
and
by
processes
less
cumbersome
than
courts
can
offer.
the
federal
employers
liability
act,
on
the
other
hand,
gives
a
special
federally
created
remedy
against
railroads
for
injuries
that
they
cause.
the
problem
in
this
case
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
you
have
one
federal
statute
that
precludes
a
judicial
remedy
while
the
other
provides
a
judicial
remedy.
nevertheless,
over
the
60
years
that
these
two
statutes
have
existed
side
by
side
there
has
been
very
little
conflict
between
them,
and
the
reason
is
simple.
so
long
as
the
rla
is
given,
as
it
usually
has
been,
its
traditional
usually
understood
meaning
as
applying
to
the
resolution
of
workplace
disputes,
that
is,
how
the
shop
ought
to
be
run
and
what
the
relationship
should
be
between
supervisor
and
employee,
and
the
fela
on
the
other
hand
is
given
its
traditional,
usually
understood
meaning
as
applying
to
the
redress
of
physical
injuries.
then
there
will
be
few
cases,
if
any,
in
which
courts
will
have
any
difficulty
deciding
which
statute
covers
which
case.
clearly,
if
that
approach
is
followed
here
there
is
no
question
how
this
case
must
be
resolved.
mr.
buell's
grievance
against
his
employer,
santa
fe,
really
boils
down
to
a
disagreement
with
his
foreman,
mr.
wright,
over
their
respective
duties.
he
makes
three
basic
allegations.
the
first
is
that
he
had
been
given
two
conflicting
sets
of
instructions
as
to
how
to
fill
out
car
inspection
reports,
second,
that
he
was
forced
to
assist
mr.
wright
in
what
he
considered
to
be
illegal
activity,
namely
or
principally
removing
ice
and
plywood
from
the
yard.
and
third,
and
beyond
any
question
the
most
important,
that
his
supervisor
aid
not
adequately
discipline
other
employees
and
prevent
them
from
ridiculing
and
intimidating
mr.
buell
by
doing
such
things
as
posting
anonymous
cartoons
making
fun
of
mr.
buell's
physical
appearance.
the
first
step
taken
by
the
respondent
and
other
employees
was
to
initiate
rla
grievance
procedures
on
account
of
mr.
wright's
alleged
wrongdoings,
and
then
about
a
year
later
mr.
buell
filed
this
fela
suit
alleging
that
santa
fe
had
wrongfully
failed
to
prevent
his
foreman
and
his
fellow
employees
from
intimidating
him,
as
a
result
of
which
he
suffered
severe
mental
and
emotional
injuries.
he
did
not
allege
any
physical
injury.
several
federal
courts
of
appeals
and
district
courts
have
cautioned
against
the
potential
for
effectively
repealing
the
railway
labor
act.
through
what
those
courts
have
called
artful
pleading
in
drafting
personal
injury
complaints
under
either
the
rla...
excuse
me,
under
either
the
fela
or
state
law,
and
ironically
the
most
thoughtful
of
those
opinions
comes
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
this
case
is
the
classic
example
of
why
that
is
a
legitimate
concern.
look
at
the
issues
that
are
going
to
have
to
be
resolved
by
whoever
decides
this
cases.
they
arise
out
of
disagreements
between
an
employee
and
his
foreman
over
the
rules
of
the
shop.
were
there
in
fact
conflicting
instructions,
and
if
so
then
which
instruction
should
prevail.
what
are
the
company
rules
concerning
taking
scrap
plywood
home?
and
most
important
of
all,
what
are
the
foreman's
obligations
to
keep
other
employees
from
making
fun
of
mr.
buell?
those
are
the
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
clearly
you
can,
and
clearly
you
can
do
both,
and
those
two
can
exist
side
by
side.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
this
case
is
different
simply
because
there
is
no
legitimate
fela
complaint
that
has
been
stated.
there
is
no
legitimate
fela
cause
of
action
that
has
been
stated
in
this
case.
in
order
to
reach--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--oh,
yes,
we
are.
we
are
making
two
arguments.
the
first
is,
we
are
doing
all
of
it
in
the
context
of
the
general
proposition
that
in
order
to
reach
a
proper
accommodation
between
these
two
statutes,
what
you
have
to
look
at
is,
first,
what
is
the
interpretation
of
each
that
will
harmonize
the
two
so
as
to
minimize
the
conflict
between
them,
and
then
you
have
to
ask
yourself
what
is
the
real
thrust
of
this
particular
complaint?
is
it
really
in
the
nature
of
a
traditional
fela
complaint
which
is
tied
to
physical
injury
or
is
it,
does
it
really
arise
out
of
a
disagreement
as
to
what
are
the
rules
of
the
shop
and
who
is
to
do
what
in
this
particular--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
indeed
we
are.
for
the
60
years...
for
the
first
58
of
the
60
years
that
the
fela
had
been
in
existence
there
was
never
any
single
federal
court
that
had
ever
held
that
purely
emotional
injury,
that
is,
without
any
physical
injury--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
at
least
is
not...
we
are
not
protesting
that
part
of
the
claim.
that
is
correct.
what
we
are
contending
is
that
there
can
be
no
fela
action
without
a
physical
injury.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
i
think
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
so.
the
fela
by
its
terms
applies
only
to
negligence.
however,
it
has
been
settled
for
some
time
that
it
also
does
apply
to
intentional
injury,
and
in
any
event
the
reason
that
we
contend
that
the
fela
does
not
apply
in
this
case
is
because
of
the
lack
of
a
physical
injury
or,
to
use
the
seventh
circuit's
language
in
lancaster,
torts
that
work
their
harm
through
physical
means.
what
you
really
have
to
do...
the
heart
of
the
ninth
circuit's
error
in
this
case
was
that
it
held
first
that
the
rla
does
not
apply,
and
second
that
the
fela
does
apply.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
exactly
right,
and
i
would
like
to
take
those
one
by
one
now
and
establish
the
ninth
circuit's
error
as
to
each
of
them.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
under
the
rla
these
adjustment
boards
have
the
authority
to
give
standard
arbitration
kinds
of
awards.
they
can
award
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
damages
in
the
sense
of
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
now,
they
can't
award
damages
in
the
sense
of
the
kinds
of
damages
that
a
court
would
under
an
fela,
but
the
point
is
that
what
we
are
looking
at
here
is
congress's
intent
in
passing
these
two
statutes,
and
there
is
no
question
that
congress
when
it
passed
the
rla
wanted
these
workplace
disputes,
these
disputes
over
how
the
shop
is
supposed
to
be
run
to
be
resolved
through
these
nonjudicial
arbitration
projects.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
and
perhaps
i
did
not
fully
understand
the
thrust
of
his
question.
we
have
two
arguments
and
they
have
been
correctly
summarized
by
the
chief
justice,
and
one
of
them
is,
this
is
not
an
fela
case.
now,
if
it
were
an
fela
case
then
what
you
have
to
do
at
that
point
is
to
ask...
there
are
really
two
subsequent
questions
that
you
ask.
the
first
one
is,
is
the
real
gravamen
of
this
dispute,
does
the
real
gravamen
of
this
particular
dispute
put
it
into
the
rla
came
or
the
fela
camp,
and
that
is
the
approach
that
was
taken
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
earlier
magnuson
decision,
and
we
think
that
is
the
one
that...
that
is
an
approach
that
has
to
be
taken
if
you
are
to
avoid
the
artful
pleading
type
of
problem.
now,
there
can
be
some
instances,
and
perhaps
this
is
the
thrust
of
what
justice
scalia
is
asking,
there
can
be
some
instances
nevertheless
when
you
have
a
hard
time
saying,
well,
does
it
squarely
fit
in
one
or
does
it
squarely
fit
in
the
other,
and
under
those
circumstances
we
contend
that
the
tilt
should
be,
in
the
close
cases,
should
be
toward
the
railway
labor
act
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
one
is
that
the
basic
question
here
is
a
question
of
what
is
the
proper
forum,
and
it
is
the
railway
labor
act
that
deals
precisely
with
that
issue
of
what
should
be
the
proper
forum.
let
me
deal
just
briefly
then
with
the
ninth
circuit...
what
we
consider
to
be
the
ninth
circuit's
error
on
both
of
these
grounds.
first
of
all,
that
the
railway
labor
act...
it
should
have
held
that
the
railway
labor
act
does
apply,
and
second,
that
it
should
have
held
that
the
fela
does
not
apply.
there
is
no
question
that
this
case
involves
a
disagreement
that
arises
out
of
the
employment
relationship.
it
is
at
bottom
a
disagreement
over
how
to
run
a
railroad
and
who
should
be
doing
what
toward
that
end.
but
the
respondent
nevertheless
contends
that
a
workplace
controversy
is
not
a
minor
dispute
subject
to
the
rla's
compulsory
grievance
procedures
unless
it
involves
the
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
the
respondent's
principal
argument.
it
is
the
principal
issue
that
is
discussed
in
the
briefs.
it
is
essential
to
his
case
in
our
view,
and
it
is
the
lynchpin
of
the
rla
part
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
but
in
our
view
it
is
wrong
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
it
just
doesn't
apply
to
this
case
because,
as
explained
in
our
briefs
this
controversy
does
involve
interpretation
of
the
bargaining
agreement,
specifically
rules
39
and
40,
which
are
discussed
in
our
briefs,
and
remarkably
have
never
been
addressed
by
the
respondent.
but
the
even
more
important
point
is
this.
if
this
dispute
were
not
covered
by
the
bargaining
agreement,
then
you
have
effectively
repealed
part
of
the
rla
because
by
its
terms
it
applies
to,
and
i
am
quoting,
"all
disputes
growing
out
of
grievances
or
the
interpretation
or
application
of
bargaining
agreements.
"
that
language
very
simply
could
not
be
more
plain.
the
respondent
cites
cases
saying
that
the
rla
applies
to
interpretation
of
the
bargaining
agreement,
and
of
course
it
does,
but
it
also
applies
to
something
else,
and
that
something
else
is
grievances.
otherwise
why
would
congress
have
used
this
disjunctive,
"or".
the
legislative
history
makes
it
very
clear
that
congress
meant
what
it
said.
we
have
those
citations
in
our
brief.
i
will
refer
just
to
the
one
from
congressman
barkley,
who
was
the
principal
legislative
sponsor
of
this
bill,
that
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
to
resolve,
and
i
am
quoting,
"disagreements
over
grievances,
interpretations,
discipline,
and
other
technicalities
that
arise
from
time
to
time
in
the
workshop
and
out
on
the
tracks.
"
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
reason
in
our
view
that
they
are
not,
justice
o'connor,
is
because
you
have
to
reach
some
kind
of
an
accommodation
of
both
statutes,
and
you
cannot
simply
turn
your
back
on
either
of
them.
now,
my
opponent
takes
the
position
that
we
have
effectively
repealed
the
fela.
our
position
is
that
their
view,
and
certainly
in
this
case,
if
this
case
on
its
facts
can
go
into
court
on
these
allegations,
then
the
rla...
then
the
rla
has
been
effectively
repealed.
we
think
the
only
way
to
prevent
that
is
to
ask
in
each
instance
what
is
the
real
thrust
of
this
particular
claim,
and
if
it
is
physical
injury,
if
what
he
is
talking
about
is
the
traditional
kind
of
thing
that
has
fallen
within
the
fela,
then
the
fela
prevails,
but
if
it
does
not,
if
the
real
thrust
of
what
he
is
complaining
about
is
how
the
workshop
ought
to
be
run,
what
are
the
rules
of
the
railroad,
then
it
ought
to
be
an
rla
grievable
offense.
there
may
be--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
think
we
do
except
that
there
are
two
different
statutes,
and
because
there
are
two
different
statutes
their
underlying
policies
cut
in
opposite
directions.
the
reason
that
in
farmer
this
court
held
that
state
law
does
not...
excuse
me,
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
preempt
state
law
was
twofold.
the
first
is
that
in
farmer
the
court
simply
reasoned
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
would
be
impeded
by
allowing
arbitration
to...
excuse
me,
by
allowing
personal
injuries
to
go
ahead
under
state
law,
but
the
difference
between
the
nlra
and
the
rla
is
very
significant
in
this
respect.
the
central
focus
of
the
railway
labor
act
is
a
dispute
or
at
least
the
minor
disputes
part
of
it
is
a
dispute
resolution
process
that
is
extrajudicial.
that
is
entirely
different
from
the
central
focus
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
does
not
proceed
in
that
way,
and
as
a
consequence
with
regard
to
the
railway
labor
act,
unlike
the
national
labor
relations
act,
you
have
this
conflict
that
comes
into
play.
the
other
difference
is
that
you
have
two
federal
statutes
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
and
with
regard
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
you
only
had
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
otherwise
the
word
"grievances"
simply
becomes
meaningless.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
but
it
says
interpretation
or
application.
and
i
think
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--all
right.
i
have
three
answers.
the
first
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that's
right.
it
is
at
least
one
instance
in
which
you
could
have
the
two
of
them
existing
side
by
side,
but
i
think
in
fairness
it
is
not
the
more
common
sense
reading
of
that
term
when
you
have
the
or,
particularly--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
exactly
the
point,
justice
scalia.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
or
at
least
if
it
relates
to
how
you
run
a
railroad,
that
is,
if
it
has
some
relationship
to
what
congressman
barkley
said
was
matters
of
discipline
or
how,
what
happens
in
the
shop
or
out
on
the
tracks,
that
is
what
congress
intended
to
do,
was
to
give
a
scheme
that
was
comprehensive,
so
that
all
of
these
disagreements
concerning
how
you
run
a
railroad,
whether
they
arise
out
of
interpretation
of
the
bargaining
agreement
or
not,
were
to
be
resolved
in
this
way.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
you
take
that
point
of
view,
and
you
may
be
right,
then
certainly
rules
39
and
40
of
this
agreement
do
cover
this
circumstance
and
under
the
facts
of
this
case
then
the
rla
definitely
does
apply.
i
would
simply
point
out,
however,
that
the
legislative
history
seems
to
say
to
us
the
contrary,
that
they
did
intend
it.
if
you
are
correct
that
the
bargaining
agreement
will
be
comprehensive
as
to
all
rules
of
the
shop,
then
it
is
true
there
is
no
overlap.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
you
take
the
point
of
view
that
there
may
be
some
matters
concerning
how
the
workplace
ought
to
be
run
that
are
not
covered
by
the
bargaining
agreement,
then
we
say
that
that
is
also
covered,
and
this
court
has
said
the
same
thing.
and
that
is
this
elgin
versus
burley
case
which
the
respondent
concedes
he
must,
in
order
to
succeed,
persuade
this
court
to
disown.
there
is
no
reason
to
do
that.
contrary
to
the
respondent
there
is
no
indication,
no
indication
in
andrews
that
it
was
rejected
in
andrews,
and
elgin
versus
burley
by
its
terms
has
been
applied
by
many
of
the
lower
courts
and
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
itself.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
i
do,
justice
powell,
in
the
sense
that
it
is
where
mr....
it
is
on
the...
in
congressman
barkley,
in
the
workplaces,
in
the
shop,
and
out
on
the
tracks.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
sir,
i
would.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
under
the
fela.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
because
you
have
then
the
physical
injury.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
and
while
that
may...
that
is
correct,
and
while
that
may
seem
to
be
somewhat
arbitrary
we
submit
it
is
a
very
important
one
because
of
the
need
to
draw
some
line
in
order
that
neither
statute
completely
consume
the
other.
that
is
the
problem
that
you
have
in
this
case.
and
we
think
that
since
federal
courts
had
gone
really
up
until
this
case
and
one
other
without
ever
defining
the
fela
to
apply
to
any
nonphysical
injury,
that
that
is
a
logical
dividing
line.
certainly
my
opponent
concedes
that
at
the
time
the
fela
was
adopted
in
1908
that
was
the
intent.
nevertheless
he
argues
that
the
fela
should
now
be
given
coverage
more
broad
than
congress
intended
in
the
first
place.
we
think
that
is
wrong
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
if
the
fela
is
to
be
expanded
in
this
coverage
it
ought
to
be
congress
that
does
it
rather
than
the
court,
but
even
more
important
is
this,
that
if
you
interpret
the
fela
as
expansively
as
my
opponent
would
suggest,
then
you
do
put
these
two
federal
statutes
into
conflict.
the
basic
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
approach
was
that
it
went
out
of
its
way
to
create
conflict
between
these
two
federal
statutes
by
giving
an
unnecessarily
crabbed
interpretation
to
the
rla
by
saying
that
it
applied,
that
it
did
not
apply
to
this
circumstance
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
these
provisions
in
the
bargaining
agreement
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
under
any
circumstance
this
dispute
is
really
about
how
to
run
a
railroad,
and
then
gave
an
unnecessarily
expansive
interpretation
to
the
fela.
as
long
as
the
two
are
carefully
interpreted
each
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
the
other,
then
there
need
never...
then
there
is
no
reason
that
the
two
cannot
continue
to
coexist
for
another
60
years
as
they
have
over
the
past.
this
point
is
really
driven
home
by
the
respondent's
attempt
to
change
his
allegations
once
the
case
gets
before
this
court.
he
now
contends
for
the
first
time
before
this
court
that
he
really
has
alleged
physical
injury
for
reasons
stated
at
pages
17
and
18
of
our
brief
it
is
our
view
that
that
cannot
be
done
before
this
court,
that
he
has
presented
one
state
of
facts
before
the
lower
courts,
the
ninth
circuit
has
made
its
ruling
on
the
basis
of
that
state
of
facts,
and
we
are
now
entitled
to
have
that
ruling
reviewed.
but
even
more
important
is
this,
that
even
if
he
were
now
permitted
to
change
his
allegations
this
would
not
save
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
and
the
reason
is
this.
congress
determined
60
years
ago
that
disputes
over
how
the
workplace
should
be
run
are
to
be
resolved
nonjudicially.
that
congressional
judgment
can
be
thwarted
by
the
wording
of
complaints
unless
courts
at
some
appropriate
point
ask
the
question,
what
is
the
real
gravamen
of
this
grievance.
is
the
real
thrust
of
this
dispute
an
fela
cognizable
injury
or
is
it
really
a
disagreement
over
how
to
run
the
shop?
here
there
is
no
question
that
the
real
focus
of
mr.
buell's
grievance
is
friction
between
a
foreman
and
his
employee.
this
is
not
a
case
that
concerns
gastritis
or
one
employee
bumping
another.
the
real
grievance
here
is
that
mr.
wright
was
not
doing
a
good
enough
job
of
keeping
the
other
men
in
line.
and
this
is
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
the
physical
injury
argument
wasn't
even
made
until
the
case
reached
this
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
just
two
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
is
that
this
has
to
be
regarded
as
a
claim
exactly
as
the
respondent
presented
it
to
the
lower
courts
involving
solely
emotional
injury.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
that
is
probably
a
fair
statement,
justice
stevens,
but
the
point
was,
they
did
allege
only
emotional
injury.
under
those
circumstances
of
course
we
argued
it
is
then
covered
by
the
rla.
then
once
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
perhaps
we
should
have
done
at
that
stage.
in
any
event
we
won
on
the
rla
argument.
then
it
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
beyond
any
question
that
the
only
question
they
were
deciding
was
whether
the
railroad
employee's
wholly
mental
injury
is
compensable
under
the
fela,
and
they
held
that
it
was,
and
that
is
the
judgment
now
that
we
are
attacking
in
this
case,
and
certainly
we
are
entitled
to
attack
the
correctness
of
that
determination
that
a
wholly
mental
injury
is
compensable
under
the
fela.
and
here
is
why
it
cannot
be.
congress
has
made
a
determination
that
the
tens
of
thousands,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
work
place
disputes
are
to
be
resolved
nonjudicially.
andrew
said
that
that
is
exclusive
and
mandatory.
there
is
the
potential
to
artfully
plead
into
a
safe
harbor,
into
a
judicial
safe
harbor
by
simply
alleging
an
fela
complaint,
so
that
the
key
to
pleading
out
of
the
rla
is
how
broadly
you
construe
the
fela.
only
three
courts
in
the
history
of...
in
the
80-year
history
of
the
fela
have
held
that
it
applies
to
nonphysical
injuries.
they
are
the
mcmillan
court,
the
california
supreme
court
in
mcmillan,
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
and
the
seventh
circuit
in
lancaster.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
justice
scalia,
i
am
saying
that
the
gastritis
really
doesn't
count
under
the
facts
of
this...
that
really
isn't
what
he
is
talking
about.
it
wasn't
what
he
alleged
below.
but
more
than
that
you
have
to
look
and
see
what
is
the
real
gravamen
of
what
he
is
talking
about.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
my
argument.
i
would
also
say,
i
would
also
say
that
even
in
that
harder
case
you
have
to
ask
what
is
the
real
thrust
of
what
he
is
asking
for
here?
is
he
really
complaining
about
gastritis
or
is
he
really
complaining
about
his
foreman's
supervision
of
the
workplace?
thank
you
very
much.
