well,
mr.
lee,
i
don't
understand
why
if
you
are
right
about
the
railway
labor
act,
that
actions
from
mental
injury
stemming
from
grievable
disputes
are
preempted
by
the
railway
labor
act,
why,
then,
are
not
physical
injuries
that
also
stem
from
grievable
disputes
not
similarly
preempted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
would
you
not
approach
this
case
in
the
same
way
the
court
did
with
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
mccall,
do
you
really
think
that
congress
back
in
1908
thought
it
was
authorizing
an
fela,
a
cause
of
action
for
that
kind
of
thing
or
even
for
mental
injury?
was
there
any
state
in
the
united
states
at
that
time
that
even
allowed
recovery
for
this
type
of
injury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
it
we
think
that
fela
just
doesn't
cover
emotional
injuries?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
indications,
though,
were
that
congress
had
in
mind
physical
injuries
arising
out
of
some
kind
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
employer
with
regard
to
the
equipment
or
working
conditions,
didn't
it?
i
mean,
that
was
the
background.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
may
be
some
state
court
tort
action
remedy
that
survives
for
outrageous
conduct,
don't
you
suppose?
