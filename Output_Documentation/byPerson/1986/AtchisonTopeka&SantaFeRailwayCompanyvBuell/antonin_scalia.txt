justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lee,
wouldn't
that
also
be
the
case
if
you
had
just
a
standard
fela
negligence
action
where
prior
to
the
accident
there
had
been
complaints
about
slipshod
procedures
within
the
shop
or
about
some
other
matters
that
would
constitute
negligence?
you
could
grieve
those,
those
negligence
matters,
and
instead
of
grieving
them
you
certainly
could
bring
an
fela
lawsuit
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
is
this
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
is
quite
a
different
issue,
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you
that,
too.
why
is
there
any...
if
you
want
to
talk
about
artful
pleading
i
would
think
the
artful
pleading
consists
of
causing
an
intentional
injury
to
become
a
negligent
injury
within
the
meaning
of
the
fela
by
simply
saying
that
a
foreman
who
inflicts
intentional
injury
is
not
adequately
supervised.
are
you
making
that
assertion
here,
that
this
matter
is
not
even
covered
by
the
fela
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
talking
physical
injury,
mr.
lee.
i
am
talking
negligence.
it
is
clear
the
fela
only
applies
to
negligent
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
injury
alleged
here
is
proximately
intentionally
causing
emotional
distress
which
may
or
may
not,
depending
on
which
side
you
believe,
have
led
to
properly
alleged
physical
injury,
but
you
know,
proximately
you
have
intentional
action
on
the
part
of
the
foreman
and
some
of
the
coworkers
causing
emotional
distress,
and
that
has
been
converted
into
a
negligence
action
by
saying
that
it
was
the
company's
failure
adequately
to
supervise
that
constitutes
the
negligence.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
are
not
protesting
that
and
saying
that
that
doesn't
constitute
a
proper
fela
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
talking
emotional
injury.
you
keep
getting
back
to
that
point.
my
concern
is
intentional
injury
versus
negligent
injury.
does
intentional
injury
get
converted
into
negligent
injury
under
the
fela
simply
by
the
fact
that
the
company
aid
not
adequately
supervise
so
as
to
prevent
the
intentional
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
problem
has
arised
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
which
only
allows...
which
specifically
excludes
claims
for
intentional
injury
but
it
is
sometimes
alleged
and
some
courts
have
thought
it
is
artful
pleading
to
allege
that
where
the
government
fails
to
supervise,
let's
say,
an
enlisted
man
in
the
army
who
intentionally
inflicts
injury
on
somebody
else,
that
constitutes
negligence
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
understand
where
i
am
going?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
ask
why
it
is
you
think
that
the
language
"disputes
arising
out
of
grievances
or
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
a
grievance.
"
necessarily
means
that
the
matter
does
not
have
to
be
based
in
the
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
couldn't
you
have
a
grievance
which
consists
of
a
situation
in
which
both
the
employer
and
the
employee
are
clear
on
what
the
agreement
means
and
what
it
requires
in
this
case,
what
its
application
should
be
in
this
case.
the
only
disagreement
is
as
to
the
fact
of
the
matter,
whether
indeed
the
employer
did
this
or
that.
there
is
no
dispute
whatever
as
to
what
the
agreement
requires.
wouldn't
that
be
a
grievance
and
yet
not
be
a
dispute
arising
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
agreements?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
how
the
agreement
applies.
it
is
clear
that
the
agreement
requires
a
certain
thing,
and
what
the
employee
is
arguing
is,
that
certain
thing
was
not
provided.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
at
least
a
plausible
reading
of
the
word
"grievances".
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
i
find
is
that
once
you
depart
from
that
interpretation
what
in
the
world
is
not
covered
by
a
grievance?
an
employee
says
that
his
supervisor
borrowed
money
from
him
and
didn't
pay
it
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
grievance.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
all
arise
out
of
interpretation
of
the
bargaining
agreement
if
they
pertain
to
the
running
of
the
railroad.
certainly
any
obligation,
any
obligation
that
the
employer
has
must
be
implicit.
it
is
either
expressly
in
the
agreement
or
impliedly
in
the
agreement.
what
other
obligation
does
the
employer
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
common
law
battery,
you
assert
that
there
was
a
physical
contact
by...
was
it
wright
or
one
of
the
coworkers?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
in
the
record.
justice
antonin
scalia
were
damages
sought
for
the
pushing
or
shoving?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
physical
stress
referred
to
was
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
gastritis.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
whatever
physical
injury
there
is
is,
you
would
acknowledge,
physical
injury
arising
from
the
emotional
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
source
of
that
grievance?
it
goes
back
to
a
question
that
i
asked
mr.
lee.
isn't
the
source
of
the
grievance
that
the
employer
by
reason
of
his
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
an
obligation,
a
contractual
obligation
not
to
let
his
supervisors
behave
in
this
fashion?
isn't
it
ultimately
based
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
assert
that
that
is
an
obligation
separate
and
apart
from
any
contractual
obligation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
sure
how
this
fits
with
what
you
said
before.
i
thought
you
would
say
that
this
matter
was
not
a
grievable
matter
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
only
grievable,
according
to
your
position,
if
its
source
is
the
contract,
and
you
said
earlier
that
the
source
of
the
right
here
was
not
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
that
contractual
or
not
contractual
or
are
there
two
duties,
one
a
contractual
one
which
is
grievable,
and
another
one,
a
noncontractual
one
which
can
be
brought
under
the
fela.
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
medically
identifiable
but
not
physical
necessarily.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
medically
identifiable,
not
necessarily
physical.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
that
just
emotional
disturbance
would
be
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that
is
medically
identifiable.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccall,
i
asked
you
about
that
earlier.
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
the
only
injury
you
are
complaining
of
is
the
injury
that
was
the
result
of
the
emotional
disturbance.
you
are
not
seeking
damages
for
the
pushing
and
shoving
in
and
of
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
what
i
thought
you
responded.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
the
physical
injury
you
are
complaining
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
pushing
and
shoving.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
an
element
of
the
emotional...
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
produced
the
emotional
injury
along
with
mocking
the
man
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
let
me
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down.
the
state
court
actions
that
you
are
referring
to
that
allow
redress
for
simply
mental
injury,
they
are
actions
for
intentional
wrongdoing,
right?
those
actions
in
the
states
do
not
allow
someone
to
recover
simply
because
someone
else
negligently
causes
mental
anguish.
it
is
an
intentional
tort,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
by
and
large
it
is
intentional.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
cause
of
action
here
is
based
on
negligence.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
exclude
physical
injury
from
this
case
you
mean
to
exclude
not
merely
the
pushing
and
shoving
but
also
the
gastritis.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
are
seeking
from
this
court
is
a
narrow
holding
that
just
says,
assuming
there
wasn't
any
gastritis
resulting,
any
physical
injury
resulting
from
this
emotional
state
there
is
no
cause
of
action
under
the
fela,
and
we
will
reserve
for
another
day
whether
if
this
emotional
injury
had
caused
gastritis
or
some
physical
injury
that
would
entitle
the
plaintiff
to
a
cause
of
action.
is
that
what
you
are
asking
us
to
hold?
