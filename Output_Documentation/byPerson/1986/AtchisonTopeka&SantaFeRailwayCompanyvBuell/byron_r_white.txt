mr.
mccall--
justice
byron
r.
white
--suppose
the
foreman's
conduct
is
grieved,
and
you
have
agreements,
and
it
goes
to
the
adjustment
board,
and
suppose
that
it
is
found
that
he
hasn't
been
harassing
the
man
at
all
as
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
under
your
position
would
he
then
be
free
to
go
before
the...
to
bring
his
fela
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
suppose
these
very
facts
here.
the
only
thing
is
there
is
no
question
that
he
has
been
in
the
hospital.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
found
that
the
foreman
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
fact
was,
the
fact
is
that
he
didn't
do
what
he
claimed
that
the
employee
claims
he
did.
he
didn't
harass
them
at
all.
now,
could
you
go
ahead
and
try
it
out
again
in
the
fela
action?
i
suppose
you
could
in
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
lose
your
fela
action?
may
you
then
grieve?
i
guess
there
is
a
time
limit,
though,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is,
even
if
it
is
grievable
and
even
if
it
isn't
covered
by
the
contract
or
has
its
root
in
the
contract,
you
would
say
that
even
if
it
is
grievable,
you
can
still
have
your
fela
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
an
injury
has
to
be
something
to
him
personally.
it
won't
be
some
economic
injury.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
to
be
some
medically
identifiable
problem
that
arises
out
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
nave
an
fela
cause
of
action
if
you
simply
alleged
that
the
foreman
harassed
this
man
and
caused
this
injury
and
the
railroad
should
be
liable
for
the
acts
of
its
servants?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
have
to
say
negligence.
you
would
just
say
here
the
foremen
harassed
him,
caused
him
great
injury,
and
the
fela
intends
employers
to
be
responsible
for
the
acts
of
their
servants.
is
that
all
you
need
to
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
the
fela
confined
to
negligent
actions?
