chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-1140,
the
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe
railway
company
against
buell.
mr.
lee,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
could
win,
i
take
it,
either
by
claiming...
by
establishing
that
the
rla
applied
even
though
in
the
absence
of
the
rla
the
fela
might
apply,
or
you
could
win
by
proving
that
the
fela
didn't
apply
whether
the
rla
applied
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
mccall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
all
in
the
affidavits
and
so
forth
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
mr.
buell...
rather,
mr.
mccall?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
probably
in
this
court
you
are
limited
to
what
the
record
shows,
either
the
complaint
or
the
affidavits
produced
in
the
summary
judgment
proceedings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
are
referring
to
then
is
something
that
is
in
the
record
although
perhaps
not
used
in
the
summary
judgment
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
contrary
to
the
elgin
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
also
spoke
in
terms
that
grievable
matters
under
the
rla
were
not
just
contract
disputes
but
a
broader
classification
of
complaints.
now,
this
court
has
never
qualified
that
language
in
elgin,
has
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
to
the
judge
in
charging
the
jury
in
the
fela
case
would
have
to
either
interpret
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
a
matter
of
law
or
charge
them
to
interpret
it
as
a
matter
of
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
you
say
once
you
have
an
injury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
of
course
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
physical
injury.
it
could
be
unhappiness
with
the
way
the
foreman
is
administering
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
if
it
produce
gastritis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
could
in
your
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccall.
mr.
lee,
do
you
wish
to
say
something
more?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
