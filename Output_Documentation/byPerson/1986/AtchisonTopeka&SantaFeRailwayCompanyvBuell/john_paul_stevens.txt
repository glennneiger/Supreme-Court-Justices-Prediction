mr.
lee,
i
am
not
sure
you
really
gave
an
answer
that
i
thoroughly
understood
to
justice
scalia's
first
question,
that
if
it
were
an
ordinary
fela
case
that
arose
out
of
sloppy
procedures
and
so
forth
and
an
injury,
why
would
the
rla
not
preempt
that
cause
of
action
if
it
does
in
this
case,
and
you
answered
it
by
saying,
well,
there
is
no
fela
case
here,
but
that
is
really
your
second
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point,
mr.
lee,
about
what
happened
in
the
trial
court?
is
your
opponent
correct,
because
your
joint
appendix
is
so
very
thin
in
this
case,
in
saying
that
the
only
argument
you
made
in
support
of
the
summary
judgment
motion
was
one
based
on
the
rla
and
that
you
did
not
separately
argue
a
pure
fela
no
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
you
at
that
point,
if
that
was
that
clear
at
that
point,
why
wouldn't
you
then
also
have
made
your
alternative
argument
that
you
are
advancing
in
this
court
seeking
reversal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
also
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent
is
a
car
man
employed
by
the
petitioner
railroad.
he
brought
an
action
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
alleging
that
the
railroad
had
condoned
his
harassment
by
his
supervisor
and
fellow
employees.
that
the
harassment
had
resulted
in
his
suffering
a
severe
emotional
breakdown.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
holding
that
the
injury
arose
out
of
a
workplace
dispute,
which
was
subject
to
mandatory
arbitration
under
the
railway
labor
act,
and
therefore
the
fela
action
could
not
be
maintained.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
dispute
did
not
turn
on
the
collective
barganing
agreement
and
was
therefore
was
not
subject
to
arbitration.
the
court
also
took
the
opportunity
to
state
at
some
length
that
claims
were
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
are
cognoscible
under
the
fela.
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
in
so
far
as
it
held
that
the
rla
does
not
bar
respondent's
action
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
however
because
the
record
of
the
case
is
not
sufficiently
developed
at
this
stage
yet
to
make
it
appropriate
to
address
the
question
whether
an
fela
action
is
available
for
the
type
of
emotional
injury
that
respondent
alleged.
we
do
not
address
that
issue.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
