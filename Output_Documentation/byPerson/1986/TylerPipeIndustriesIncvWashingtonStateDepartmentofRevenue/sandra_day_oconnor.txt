mr.
young--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
companies
like
xerox
argue
that
the
washington
tax
discriminates
against
them
under
this
scheme.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
discourages...
or
encourages,
rather,
their
manufacturing
within
the
state
of
washington
and
discourages
them
from
manufacturing
outside
the
state
of
washington.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
washington
simply
repealed
its
manufacturing
tax.
i
mean,
presumably
that
would
be
an
incentive
to
move
to
washington,
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
perfectly
all
right,
though?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
have
the
same
effect,
and
you
argue--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
would
have
exactly
the
same
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
companies
like
the
xerox
company
want
as
to
make
out
their
claim
to
treat
the
wholesale
tax
and
the
manufacturing
tax
together
and
look
at
how
it
operates
as
a
unit,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
theory,
and
yet
the
appellants
like
kalama
appellants
want
us
to
look
at
the
taxes
as
separate
activities
and
consider
them
separately.
and
i
have
trouble
seeing
which
way
we
ought
to
approach
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
try
to
explain
my
dilemma
a
different
way.
if
we
look
at
these
as
two
separate
taxes,
a
tax
on
manufacturing
and
a
tax
on
wholesaling,
then
the
tax
on
the
wholesale
activity
considered
as
a
separate
activity
entirely
doesn't
appear
to
either
discriminate
against
or
burden
interstate
commerce.
it
is
simply
imposed
whenever
something
is
sold
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
one
on
manufacturing,
however,
if
you
look
at
that
as
a
separate
activity
and
a
separate
tax,
applies
to
manufacturers
who
export,
in
effect.
otherwise
it
doesn't
apply.
so
you
might
say
that
that
one
was
discriminatory.
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how,
if
you
treat
the
taxes
as
separate
entirely,
that
you
would
say
the
wholesaling
tax
is
discriminatory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
the
taxes,
though,
imposed
on
different
activities?
are
they
separately
taxable
activities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
they
are
on
separate
activities,
a
manufacturer
within
the
state
of
washington
who
then
exports
the
product
for
sale
in
another
state
is
taxed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
manufacture?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
a
manufacturer
in
washington
who
also
sells
the
product
in
washington
is
excused
from
paying
the
manufacturing
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
doesn't
that
amount
in
effect
to
a
tax
on
exports?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
if
you
view
them
as
taxes
on
separate
activities,
it
looks
pretty
clear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
have
a
decision
in
the
state
of
washington
in
the
fibreboard
case
that
makes
it
look
very
much
like
those
two
taxes
are
not
compensating
taxes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
certainly
is
language
in
armco
that
indicates
the
court
was
making
some
assumptions
and
not
waiting
for
actual
experience,
isn't
that
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
view
the
manufacturing
tax
in
washington
as
not
a
compensating
tax,
it
also
is
facially
discriminatory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
manufacturing
tax
seems
to
be
a
curious
one,
that's
almost
a
form
of
substitute
for
income
tax.
it
seems
to
be
imposed
at
every
level
of
activity
during
the
course
of
manufacturing.
every
separate
part
of
that
process
is
taxed,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
only
tax
the
little
steps
if
part
of
it
were
done
out
of
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
talking
about
your
manufacturing
tax
in
the
state
of
washington.
