justice
antonin
scalia
i
presume
at
least
some
of
your
clients
wouldn't
mind
the
approach
that
justice
o'connor
just
expressed.
you
have
some
clients
who
are
manufacturing
in
the
state
and
are
subject
to
the
state
manufacturing
tax,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
this
case
differ
from
the
boston
stock
exchange
case?
why
can't
you
say
that
the
state
here
is
simply
placing
a
tax
on
one
of...
either
one
of
two
activities
in
the
state,
either
manufacturing
or
sale,
or
wholesale,
either
one?
we'll
tax
one
or
the
other.
now,
why
is
that
any
different
from
what
new
york
in
the
boston
stock
exchange
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
would
say
then
that,
as
a
general
rule,
if
a
state
wants
to
tax
one
of
several
incidents,
that
that's
unlawful?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
wasn't
armco
decided
the
other
way,
because
couldn't
you
view
armco
as
that,
as
essentially
the
same
thing,
taxing
either
the
manufacture
or
the
sale?
we're
only
going
to
impose
one
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
other
companies
that
ashe
&
jones
represents
it
only
represents
in
washington
and
not
elsewhere
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
can't
say
that
it's
any
less
than
half
a
person,
really,
if
you
don't
really
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
take
to
make
something
a
compensating
tax?
i
mean,
suppose
you
get
an
exemption
from
the
state
income
tax
if
you
ship
it
out
of
state...
or,
i'm
sorry.
which
way
does
it
go?
if
you
sell
it
in-state?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
a
compensating
tax?
all
of
my
income
comes
only
from
this
product,
so
if
i'm
paying
income
tax
i'm
ultimately
paying
it
because
of
the
sale
of
this
product.
could
the
state
just
say,
if
you
sell
the
product
in-state
you're
exempt
from
the
state
income--
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
it
takes?
so
long
as
the
burdens
are
the
same,
they're
compensating
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
an
incentive,
there
is
an
incentive
to
you,
isn't
there,
to
sell
in
washington
rather
than
sell
outside
of
washington?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
assuming,
quite
unrealistically,
that
there's
no
sales
tax
anywhere
else,
that
there's
no
tax
on
your
selling
activity
elsewhere,
as
there
is
in
washington.
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
the
state
you're
selling
into
has
the
same
law
that
washington
has.
if
you
sell
interstate,
you'll
pay
both
a
manufacturing
tax
and
a
selling
tax.
if
you
sell
within
your
own
state,
you'll
pay
only
the
selling
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
doesn't
that
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce?
