mr.
d.
michael
young
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
appeals
come
to
the
court
from
two
decisions
of
the
state
supreme
court
of
washington.
they
involve
72
appellants,
all
of
whom
have
paid
certain
taxes
to
the
state
of
washington
and
are
trying
to
get
them
back
because
they
believe
that
the
washington
tax
statutes
are
unconstitutional.
71
of
the
taxpayers
were
consolidated
in
the
state
courts
in
a
case
styled
national
can
corporation.
these
71
appellants
challenge
the
washington
taxes
as
violating
the
commerce
clause
on
two
independent
bases:
one,
that
they
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce;
and
two,
that
they're
not
fairly
apportioned.
either
one
of
these
defects
would
be
a
sufficient
basis
to
invalidate
the
taxes.
i'll
address
the
discrimination
problem,
and
if
by
any
chance
my
limited
time
permits
i'll
also
touch
on
the
apportionment
problem.
having
granted
divided
argument,
tyler's
counsel
will
address
the
issues
that
are
peculiar
to
that
case,
which
include
two
commerce
clause
issues
similar
to
those
raised
by
the
national
can
appellants
and
several
other
issues
that
aren't
involved
in
the
national
can
appeal
at
all.
the
guts
or
perhaps
i
should
say
heart
of
this
case
are
the
taxpayers'
activities,
the
way
the
washington
taxes
are
imposed
on
those
activities,
and
the
constitutional
problems
that
they
create.
a
very
graphic
picture
of
the
hard
facts
are
provided
in
the
chart
that
was
prepared
by
the
state
of
washington,
the
appellee
here.
and
to
make
the
most
efficient
use
of
the
limited
time,
i'm
going
to
ask
the
court's
indulgence
in
referring
with
me
to
the
chart
that
the
state
prepared.
you'll
find
it
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
submitted
by
national
can
corporation,
and
in
particular
it's
appendix
k
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
so
that's
on
the
very
last
page
of
the
national
can
jurisdictional
statement,
appendix
k.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize,
this
was
prepared
by
the
state
and
not
by
us.
it
was
prepared
in
a
context
very
much
like
the
one
that
we're
in
here.
as
you
may
know,
the
state
participated
as
an
amicus
in
the
armco
versus
hardesty
case
that
was
before
the
court
a
couple
of
years
ago.
the
state
of
washington
was
trying
to
help
the
state
of
west
virginia
defend
its
taxes,
much
like
these
here,
against
a
challenge
of
unconstitutionality.
but
this
court
held,
after
listening
to
the
arguments
that
the
states
raised,
that
the
west
virginia
taxes
were
unconstitutional.
and
so
then
the
department
of
revenue
of
washington
had
the
task
of
coming
back
and
explaining
to
the
executives
of
the
state
and
the
legislature
of
the
state
why
this
court
reached
that
conclusion
with
respect
to
west
virginia's
taxes
and
why
washington's
taxes
had
the
same
kinds
of
problems.
now,
the
state
in
this
chart
put
itself,
put
the
state
of
washington,
at
the
top
in
the
large
rectangle
at
the
top,
and
it
put
the
state
of
west
virginia
at
the
bottom.
i
would
like
to
start
in
the
other
order
because
i
think
it
makes
sense
to
start
with
your
decision
in
the
armco
case.
okay,
how
does
it
depict
the
taxpayers
here?
all
of
the
taxpayers
in
national
can's
appeal,
like
armco,
are
manufacturers.
they're
producing
something.
almost
all
of
them
are
manufacturing,
a
few
of
them
are
doing
some
extracting.
the
second
thing
is
that
they,
like
armco,
are
selling
across
state
lines.
now,
in
each
case
we're
talking
about
a
manufacturer
selling.
in
this
chart
the
state
has
chosen
to
illustrate
each
activity
by
one
of
these
small
boxes.
so
you
can
see
armco
down
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
west
virginia
chart,
manufacturing
and
wholesaling.
and
they're
connected
with
an
arrow
to
indicate
that
both
boxes
go
together,
they're
one
taxpayer
doing
these
two
different
activities.
now,
you'll
notice
running
down
the
center
of
that
chart
is
kind
of
a
dashed
line.
that
represents
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
west
virginia.
and
in
armco's
case
there,
looking
at
the
very
bottom
set
of
boxes,
you
can
see
that
the
manufacturing
was
going
on
out
of
state,
the
wholesaling
was
going
on
in
west
virginia,
and
that
arrow
is
crossing
the
state
line.
this
court
looked
at
the
fact
that
armco
was
paying
west
virginia's
wholesaling
tax
and
it
compared
that
situation
with
a
like
company
doing
business
entirely
within
west
virginia.
and
that
like
company
in
the
state's
chart
here
is
the
top
set
of
boxes
in
the
west
virginia
part
of
the
chart
there.
you
can
see
that
both
the
manufacturing
and
wholesaling
was
going
on
in
west
virginia.
no
state
boundary
is
crossed.
the
important
thing
you
can
see
there
is
that
box
for
wholesaling,
if
you're
an
in-state
taxpayer,
is
not
cross-hatched,
and
the
fact
that
it's
not
cross-hatched,
according
to
the
state's
symbolism,
means
it
doesn't
get
taxed.
so
the
court
looked
at
a
tax
on
the
interstate
company
wholesaling,
no
tax
on
the
local
company
wholesaling,
and
concluded
that
there
was
facial
discrimination
there.
i'd
like
to
move
now
to
the
top
of
the
chart,
because
that's
what
really
tells
us
about
washington's
taxes.
up
there
you'll
see
a
striking
similarity.
that
shouldn't
be
very
surprising.
in
washington's
amicus
brief
to
the
court
in
armco,
the
state
representated
that
its
taxes
were
very
similar
to
those
of
west
virginia.
you'll
see
at
the
very
top
pair
of
boxes
there
local
commerce
in
washington;
again
two
activities,
the
same
company
is
manufacturing
and
it's
selling.
but
again,
only
one
of
those
two
activities
is
taxed.
the
only
difference,
really,
between
the
top
of
the
chart
and
the
bottom
of
the
chart
is
that
washington
has
reversed
its
exemption,
so
in
washington
it's
the
selling
that
gets
taxed,
the
manufacturing
is
exempt.
in
west
virginia
it
was
the
opposite.
now,
i'd
invite
the
court
to
compare
the
situation
for
that
local
company
with
our
taxpayers
who
are
before
you
today.
about
a
third
of
those
taxpayers
are
like
kalama
chemical
company,
and
it's
represented
by
the
middle
set
of
boxes
there.
it's
manufacturing
in
washington,
it
ships
what
it
manufactures
across
state
lines
and
sells
it
in
other
states.
as
you
can
see,
washington
imposes
on
that
interstate
company
the
manufacturing
tax
because
it
has
chosen,
instead
of
refraining
from
interstate
commerce,
to
sell
across
state
lines.
another
group
of
our
clients
are
represented
by
the
bottom
set
of
boxes
there.
they're
in
a
situation
like
xerox
corporation.
they
do
their
manufacturing
in
some
other
state,
ship
the
goods
across
state
lines
into
washington,
and
sell
them
there.
now,
when
we
looked
at
the
local
company,
when
that
local
company...
when
any
company
manufactures
in
washington,
it
incurs
a
liability
for
the
tax
on
manufacturing.
but
if
it
refrains
from
engaging
in
interstate
commerce,
if
it
will
sell
the
goods
in
washington
and
pay
that
washington
tax
on
the
selling
activity,
that
company
will
get
a
significant
tax
benefit,
an
exemption.
it
gets
a
forgiveness
of
the
liability
it
had
already
incurred
for
doing
the
manufacturing
in
the
state.
mr.
d.
michael
young
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
d.
michael
young
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
michael
young
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
michael
young
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
if
washington--
mr.
d.
michael
young
--under
the
discrimination
prong
of
the
commerce
clause,
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right
for
the
future,
justice
o'connor.
it
wouldn't--
mr.
d.
michael
young
--excuse
me?
mr.
d.
michael
young
well,
it
wouldn't
have
the
same
effect,
your
honor,
because
there
would
no
longer
be
a
benefit
to
the
in-state
manufacturers
that
wasn't
given
to
out
of
state
people.
it
would
put
them
on
a
level
playing
field.
the
in-state
people
there
would
only
be
paying
a
selling
tax,
but
they
wouldn't
be
getting
to
carry
on
an
additional--
mr.
d.
michael
young
--the
companies
really
don't
care
which
way
it's
treated
as
long
as
it's
treated
consistently.
mr.
d.
michael
young
your
honor,
i
think
from
all
of
these
appellants'
standpoint
the
court
could
go
which...
approach
it
either
way,
as
long
as
it
does
so
consistently.
the
situation
of
xerox
is
just
like
the
situation
in
maryland
versus
louisiana.
you
there
had
local
people
who
paid
one
local
tax...
excuse
me,
who
paid
one
tax
that
was
common
to
interstate
commerce
and
thereby
got
a
credit
against
local
commerce.
the
giving
of
that
credit
that
was
not
available
to
interstate
commerce
precisely
because
they
weren't
doing
business
there
was--
mr.
d.
michael
young
--your
honor,
i
guess
the
way
i'd
put
it
is
that,
without
regard
to
the
exact
nature
of
the
benefit,
whether
it's
the
forgiveness
of
a
liability
for
something
entirely
different
from
taxes
or
whatever,
if
the
state
gives
a
benefit
of
any
kind
to
local
commerce
that
it's
not
giving
to
interstate
commerce
and
that's
based
on
some
interstate
element,
it
is
discrimination.
and
we
really
needn't
look
at
what
the
kind
of
manufacturing
tax
is
or
that
kind
of
thing.
it's
the
fact
that
there
isn't
a
benefit.
mr.
d.
michael
young
justice
scalia,
actually
none
of
our
clients
would
mind
having
all
of
the
taxes
viewed
together,
because
if
they're
viewed
together
the
apportionment
problem
is
so
blatant
that
i
think
that
some
kind
of
relief
would
be
required
for
everybody.
mr.
d.
michael
young
the
new
york
tax,
that
the
state
of
washington
has
urged
is
similar
to
this,
was
a
tax
that
wasn't
before
the
court.
it
was
a
prior
tax
that
ostensibly
or
nominally
had
several
different
possible
subjects
or
incidents
of
the
tax.
the
court
was
focusing
on
the
current
tax,
that
had
a
clear
rate
differential,
and
in
the
context
of
that
focus
it
didn't
see
any
problem
with
neutrality.
and
it
may
be
in
fact
that
if
you
knew
lots
more
about
the
old
tax
and
how
it
was
imposed
that
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
problem.
but
the
case
itself
just
doesn't
give
us
enough
information
to
know
that.
mr.
d.
michael
young
it
does
expose
interstate
commerce
to
multiple
burdens
that
local
commerce
isn't
exposed
to,
and
if
that
happens
in
fact
it
would
be
unlawful,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
michael
young
i
suspect
the
reason
that
armco
wasn't
decided
that
way
was
that
the
court
focused
on
the
two
activities
that
were
claimed
to
be
essentially
the
same
and
looked
at
them
and
realized
that
they
weren't
quite
the
same,
whereas
in
boston
stock
exchange
you
were
looking
at
all
things
that
were
part
and
parcel
of
a
transfer
of
stock
and
they
were
quite
closely
related,
would
typically
occur
in
one
state.
the
national
can
situation
is
seen
if
we
look
at
the
last
two
sets
of
boxes
on
the
chart
there,
and
i
think
it
kind
of
pulls
all
of
this
together,
in
that
you
can
see
someone
who
is
both
manufacturing
and
selling
out
of
the
state
and
manufacturing
outside
the
state
and
selling
in.
and
you
see
there
that
we've
got
a
taxpayer
now--
