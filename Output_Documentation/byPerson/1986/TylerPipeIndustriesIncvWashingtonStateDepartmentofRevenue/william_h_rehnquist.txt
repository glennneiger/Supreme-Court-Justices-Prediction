you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
young.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
young,
your
time
has
expired.
we'll
hear
next
from
you,
mr.
o'brien.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
o'brien,
in
a
couple
of
past
cases,
particularly
i
think
one
of
the
last
ones
from
washington,
the
standard
steel
case,
we
have
said
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
taxpayer
to
show
multiple
taxation.
the
possibility
of
it
in
some
abstract
way
isn't
enough.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
one
of
your
grounds
here
the
danger
of
multiple
taxation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
else
are
you
being
taxed
on
these
activities
besides
washington,
and
in
what
manner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
was
no
multiple
taxation
in
fact
in
your
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'brien.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
collins.
mr.
o'brien,
you
have
eight
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
matter
with
that
if
someone
is
an
agent
for
a
principal?
couldn't
the
state
levy
a
tax
both
on
the
agent
for
the
activities
as
an
agent
and
on
the
principal
by
reason
of
the
activities
of
the
agent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
if
the
agent
is
obviously
present
in
the
state
of
washington
for
its
own
activities,
and
if
it's
in
fact
the
agent
of
your
client,
i
just
don't
see
what
in
our
cases
prevents
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
contrary
to
any
principles
of
agency
law
i
ever
knew
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
why
should
nexus
law
be
any
different
than
agency
law
in
this
respect,
when
you're
trying
to
see
whether
your
company
had
a
presence
within
the
state?
you
can
certainly
have
a
presence
within
the
state
through
agents,
can't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
o'brien,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
