mr.
william
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
begin
by
discussing
the
issues
common
to
both
national
can
and
tyler
pipe,
discrimination
and
apportionment,
and
then
i
will
turn
to
the
issue
of
nexus,
which
concerns
tyler
pipe
alone.
with
regard
to
discrimination,
the
commerce
clause
provides
that
a
state
cannot
provide
through
its
taxes
a
direct
commercial
advantage
to
local
business.
on
the
other
hand,
the
commerce
clause
does
not
prohibit
a
state
from
encouraging
intrastate
commerce,
for
competing
for
interstate
commerce,
so
long
as
it
does
not
discriminatorily
tax
the
products
or
services
of
other
states.
and
the
key
is,
how
do
you
tell
discrimination
from
fair
encouragement?
this
court,
beginning
in
boston
stock
exchange,
laid
down
a
bright
line
test
to
distinguish
discrimination
from
fair
encouragement,
and
that
test
is
simply
this:
a
tax
discriminates
if
it
affects
the
direction
of
commerce,
either
by
erecting
a
barrier
against
interstate
commerce
or
by
telling
an
interstate
business
that's
already
present
in
the
state
that
it
can
reduce
its
level
of
taxes
in
the
state
if
it
increases
its
business
activity
in
that
state.
on
the
other
hand,
a
tax
does
not
discriminate
if
it
treats
intrastate
commerce
and
local
business
equally,
allowing
for
tax
neutral
decisionmaking.
and
the
boston
stock
exchange
case,
westinghouse,
maryland
v.
louisiana
that
came
after
it,
all
adhere
to
this
principle.
and
justice
scalia,
with
regard
to
your
question,
i
think
boston
stock
exchange
is
really
a
key
point.
my
opponent
mr.
young
said
that
the
pre-1968
case
was
not
before
the
court,
which
is
of
course
true.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
contrast
the
two
tax
systems:
one
discriminatory,
the
later
system;
and
the
other,
neutral
system,
as
being
not
discriminatory.
and
we
think
that
that's
highly
significant.
in
addressing
the
rest
of
my
remarks
on
discrimination,
i
want
to
just
briefly
talk
about
the
tax
system
and
then
in
turn
discuss
the
selling
tax
and
the
manufacturing
tax.
washington
imposes
its
tax
on
the
privilege
of
selling
in
washington
and
on
the
privilege
of
manufacturing
in
washington,
and
the
rate
and
measure
of
these
taxes
are
essentially
identical.
mr.
william
b.
collins
yes,
justice
o'connor,
they
are
separately
taxable
activities.
but
the
same
business
does
not
pay
both
taxes
on
the
same
product.
that's
because
of
the
so-called
multiple
activities
exemption,
which
basically
says
if
you
pay
a
selling
tax
with
regard
to
a
product
you
are
not
liable
to
pay
manufacturing
tax
on
making
that
product.
so
in
other
words,
in
washington
you'll
always
pay
one
tax
on
the
product,
but
you
won't
pay
two.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
collins
if
he
has
paid
the
selling
tax,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
the
reason
it
doesn't--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
i
don't
think
that...
that's
not
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
reason
is
because
the
manufacturing
tax
is
a
compensating
tax,
just
like
the
use
tax
is
a
compensating
tax.
the
example
which
you
gave
me
would
also
apply
exactly
to
a
general
use
tax
primarily
imposed
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
the
fibreboard
case
is
a
situation,
of
course,
which
isn't
before
this
court,
because
in
that
case
a
manufacturer
partially
manufactured
in
washington,
partially
finished
the
manufacturing
out
of
the
state,
and
then
sold
the
product
back
in
washington,
and
paid
two
taxes,
both
a
selling
tax
and
a
manufacturing
tax.
that
system
would
fail
our
bright
line
test,
and
if
any
of
the
taxpayers
here
were
doing
business
in
that
way
we
would
lose.
but
the
reason
that
it's
discriminatory
is
because
the
multiple
activities
exemption
did
not
operate.
the
normal
rule
in
washington
is
you
only
pay
one
tax
with
regard
to
the
same
product,
just
as
in
a
sales
and
use
tax
situation
you
only
pay
one
tax
with
regard
to
the
same
product.
if
the
multiple
activities
exemption
had
operated,
then
you
would
have
had
that
single
tax
and
it
would
have
been
neutral.
i
mean,
it's
a
completely
different
situation.
mr.
william
b.
collins
justice
scalia--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--no.
mr.
william
b.
collins
one
of
the
fights
between
the
parties
in
this
case
is
over
compensating
tax
criteria,
and
the
criteria
that
we
have
urged
and
is
supported
by
this
court's
decisions
is
kind
of
a
two-pronged
criteria.
you've
got
to
look
at
the
two
taxes
you're
comparing,
an
income
tax
and
some
other
tax
or
in
this
particular
case
a
selling
tax
and
a
manufacturing
tax.
mr.
william
b.
collins
and
ask
two
questions:
are
the
taxes
designed
to
achieve
equality,
and
do
they
actually
result
in
equal
treatment
of
in-state
and
out
of
state
taxpayers
similarly
situated?
now,
with
your
example,
an
income
tax
has
been
found
to
be
a
compensating
type
tax
with
a
corporate
franchise
tax.
let
me
give
you
a
citation,
justice
scalia.
west
publishing
company
versus
mcgoldman.
it's
166
pacific
2nd
551,
and
it
was
affirmed
in
a
per
curiam
decision
by
this
court
in
328
u.s.
823.
in
that
case,
california
had
a
corporate
franchise
tax
imposed
only
on
local
business
and
it
had
an
income
tax
that
was
imposed
on
interstate
commerce,
and
there
was
a
multiple
activities
exemption
that
basically
said
if
you
pay
the
corporate
franchise
tax
you
don't
have
to
pay
the
income
tax.
and
the
california
court
and
this
court
had
no
difficulty
in
saying
that
that
was
not
discriminatory
because
the
burdens
were
equal
in
those
two
taxes.
so
in
this
situation,
for
example,
in
the
case
before
the
court
here,
washington's
selling
and
manufacturing
taxes
are
compensating
taxes.
they're
designed
to
achieve
equality
because
they
have
the
same
rate
and
measure
with
regard
to
the
same--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--that's
right.
but
you
have
to...
that's
the
key
to
the
decision
and
the
key
to
essentially
tax-neutral
decisionmaking.
i
mean,
the
reason
that
a
compensating
tax
works,
the
engine
that
drives
it,
is
it
passes
the
bright
line
test.
that
is
to
say,
a
compensating
tax
is
neutral
with
regard
to
the
direction
of
commerce.
in
washington,
if
you
manufacture
a
product
in
this
state
and
sell
it
here
you'll
pay
selling
tax.
if
you
manufacture
it
in
this
state
and
sell
it
someplace
else,
you'll
pay
manufacturing
tax,
but
the
amount
of
those
taxes
will
be
the
same.
so
there's
no
incentive
for
you
to
say,
i'm
going
to
move
my
manufacturing
operation
out
of
the
state
and
sell
into
washington
or
i'm
going
to
move
my
manufacturing
operation
into
the
state
and
sell
in
washington.
your
bottom
line
taxes
will
be
the
same.
mr.
william
b.
collins
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
on
a
$1,000...
if
you
manufacture
a
product
worth
$1,000
in
washington
and
sell
it
in
another
state,
you'll
pay
$4.40
in
manufacturing
tax.
if
you
manufacture
it
in
washington
and
sell
it
in
washington,
you'll
pay
$4.40
of
selling
tax.
mr.
william
b.
collins
two
things
about
that--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
don't
think
it
does,
justice
scalia,
but
that's
a
question
that
this
court
has
yet
to
resolve.
and
it
goes
back
to
the
court's
decision
in
southern
pacific
versus
gallagher.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
i
don't
think
that's
accurate,
justice
stevens.
and
the
reason
why
is
because
in
armco
this
court--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--this
court
ruled
that
the
manufacturing
tax
and
the
wholesaling
tax
weren't
compensating
taxes,
because
they
didn't
pass
the
criteria.
they
were
not
proxies
for
one
another
because
of
differences
in
the
rate
and
differences
in
the
measure.
and
the
court--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
your
honor,
exhibit
k
also
perfectly
describes
the
situation
in
southern
pacific
versus
gallagher,
because
in
that
case
if
you
bought
a
product
in
another
state
and
sold
it...
i'm
sorry,
bought
a
product
in
another
state,
used
it
in
california,
you
would
pay
hypothetically
two
taxes,
a
selling
tax
in
the
other
state
and
a
use
tax
in
california.
a
local
business
buying,
a
local
person
buying--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--it's
not
the
direction--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--yes.
mr.
william
b.
collins
it's
not
the
direction
that
determines
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not.
it's
not
that
we
give
our
exemption
for
manufacturers
who
sell
in
the
state.
that's
not
what
drives
it.
west
virginia
could
cure
their
problem
if
they
did
two
things:
one,
if
the
rates
of
the
selling
and
the
manufacturing
taxes
were
the
same;
and
two,
if
the
measures
of
tax
were
the
same,
because
it
was
those
things
that
the
court
looked
at.
mr.
william
b.
collins
this
court
has
never
taken
into
account
the
taxes--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--they
would
pay
more
taxes.
mr.
william
b.
collins
they
would
pay
more
taxes.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
correct.
but,
justice
stevens,
that
would
be
true
in
any
event
if
you
have
different
states
that
have
different
taxes.
for
example,
at
the
end
of
the
armco
opinion
the
court
stated
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
if
ohio
had
a
manufacturing
tax
and
west
virginia
had
a
selling
tax.
clearly
that
would
be
doubling
up,
and
at
the
same
time
an
intrastate
business
that
just
did
one
thing
would
only
pay
one
tax.
and
that's
why
southern
pacific
versus
gallagher
is
really
a
key
case,
because
in
southern
pacific
versus
gallagher
the
court
was
faced
with
exactly
the
same
situation,
the
possibility
of
no
doubling
up
in-state,
sales
and
use
tax,
and
a
possibility
of
doubling
up
out
of
state
if
a
tax
had
been
paid
in
the
other
state.
and
the
taxpayer
said:
there's
a
possibility
that
we
could
be
doubled
up
in
this
other
state;
give
us
some
relief.
and
what
the
court
said
is--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--that's
true.
mr.
william
b.
collins
but
the
court
refused,
though,
in
that
case
to
speculate
about
what
another
state
would
do,
and
that's
really,
i
think,
a
correct
decision
and
one
that
would
be
appropriate
even
if
it
was
a
question
of
first
impression.
the
reason
for
that
is
simply
this.
in
california
in
southern
pacific
and
in
this
case,
the
state
of
washington
relieves
a
business
from
the
tax,
manufacturing
tax,
only
if
the
selling
tax
is
paid.
those
are
the
only
circumstances
in
which
we
do
it,
only
if
the
selling
tax
is
paid.
the
taxpayers
in
southern
pacific
versus
gallagher
and
in
this
case
say:
we
want
to
be
relieved
from
washington's
tax
even
though
we
don't
pay
a
tax
to
washington
and
we
don't
pay
a
tax
anyplace
else
either.
the
taxpayers
here
are
not
asking
for
equality.
what
they're
really
asking
for
is
a
preference.
mr.
william
b.
collins
if
the
sales
are
made
within
the
state.
mr.
william
b.
collins
sure,
that's
right.
and
it
passes,
compensating
taxes
like
that
pass
the
bright
line
test.
what's
really...
the
question
that's
really
open
is
this.
compensating
taxes
are
justified
because
they
pass
the
bright
line
test,
local
commerce
and
interstate
commerce
within
the
state
are
treated
equally.
and
the
question
left
open
in
southern
pacific
versus
gallagher
is
simply
whether
that
equality
has
got
to
extend
to
the
interstate
taxpayer,
in
the
words
of
silas
mason,
"the
dweller"...
"the
stranger
from
beyond
the
gates
and
the
dweller
within
the
gates.
"
in
southern
pacific
versus
gallagher,
the
question
left
open
is
whether
your
compensating
tax
has
not
only
got
to
ensure
one
tax,
equal
tax
within
the
state,
but
whether
that's
got,
that
credit
has
got
to
go
into
the
interstate
area.
and
i
think
the
court
was
correct
in
deciding
not
to
address
that
question
until
a
taxpayer
came
in
who
had
actually
paid
that
second
tax,
because
one
of
two
things
would
happen
if
you
don't
wait:
a,
you'll
say
you
need
to
extend
the
benefit,
but
the
taxpayer
wouldn't
receive
any
benefit.
for
example,
these
taxpayers
don't
pay
the
manufacturing
tax
or
a
selling
tax
to
another
state,
so
essentially
it
would
be
doing
a
useless
act.
or
b,
they
would
be
getting
a
preference.
that
is,
local
business
would
have
to
pay
one
selling
or
manufacturing
tax
to
escape
a
tax,
but
interstate
commerce
would
have
to
pay
no
selling
tax
to
escape
the
manufacturing
tax.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
the
language
in
armco
really
says,
justice
o'connor.
we're
kind
of
talking
about
this
internal
consistency
point,
i
think
is
how
the
taxpayers
have
discussed
it
in
their
brief
and
kind
of
what
the
court
mentioned
in
armco.
and
really,
that
point
i
think,
when
you
read
the
language,
was
simply
in
response
to
west
virginia's
allegation
that,
even
though
interstate
commerce
pays
a
selling
tax
and
it's
not
a
compensating
tax,
that
the
taxpayer
should
somehow
be
required
to
prove
that
they
had
actually
been
injured,
even
though
that
tax
was
facially
discriminatory.
and
the
court
said,
no,
that's
not
the
test,
and
talked
about
the
internal
consistency
concept,
but
related
it
to
situations
where
there
is
facial
discrimination.
mr.
william
b.
collins
no
question
about
it,
no
question
about
it.
but
as
i've
indicated,
if
you
follow
the
court's
criteria
in
i
think
virtually
all
of
its
compensating
tax
decisions,
you
will
find
that
the
criteria
is
equality,
which
was
not
present
in
the
west
virginia
tax
in
armco
and
is
present
in
this
case.
the
bottom
line
is
there's
a
bright
line
test
that
this
court
has
established
for
discrimination.
the
selling
tax
passes
it
because
everybody
pays
the
selling
tax.
local
manufacturers,
interstate
manufacturers,
they
pay
precisely
the
same
tax.
the
manufacturing
tax
passes
the
bright
line
test
because
it's
a
compensating
tax,
like
a
use
tax.
it
passes
the
test
because
interstate
commerce
and
intrastate,
local
commerce,
are
treated
the
same
and
there's
no
discrimination.
and
the
taxpayers
in
this
case
have
not
shown
that
they
pay
another
tax
someplace
else.
what
they
really
want
is
a
preference.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
apportionment
point.
mr.
william
b.
collins
yes.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
it's
a
different
case
because
then
they
wouldn't
then...
if
the
court
said
that
something
was
required,
they
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
relief.
and
if
you're
asking
me
whether
i
think
that
the
court
would
ultimately
say
you've
got
to
extend
the
credit--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
our
statute...
just
the
act
of
having
the
tax
doesn't
make
the
statute
unconstitutional.
but
then
the
question
would
be
directly
put:
must
a
compensating
tax
extend
equality
to
interstate
commerce
that
it
extends
to
intrastate
commerce?
mr.
william
b.
collins
well--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--no,
it
doesn't
depend
on
it.
but
that
would
then...
the
taxpayer
would
really
be
in
a
position
to
raise
that
question.
mr.
william
b.
collins
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
collins
with
regard
to
the
apportionment
question,
there's
really
no
multiple
tax.
there's
no
multiple
tax
that's
been
established
in
this
case,
and
the
court
in
a
number
of
decisions
has
indicated
that
a
tax
like
washington's
tax
is
fairly
apportioned.
remember,
our
tax
is
imposed
on
the
privilege
of
selling
within
washington
state
and
it's
also
imposed
on
the
privilege
of
manufacturing
within
washington
state.
and
it's
measured
by,
the
selling
tax
is
measured
by,
the
gross
proceeds
of
sales;
and
the
manufacturing
tax
is
measured
by
the
value
of
the
products.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
it
would
just
be
taxed
once,
on
the
final
finished
product
that
was
subject
to
the
tax.
we
don't
tax
it
at
all
the
little
steps.
the
only
reason--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--are
you
talking
about
the
fibreboard
situation?
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
if
you
manufacture
something
in
the
state
of
washington
and
then
it
goes
outside
the
state,
partially
manufactured,
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
value
of
that
product.
if
it's
completed
within
the
state,
it's
imposed
on
the
value
of
that
product.
and
the
problem
in
the
fibreboard
case
was
that...
our
court
ruled
that
when
it
came
back
in
the
state,
the
multiple
activities
exemption
didn't
operate
because
the
product
was
not
the
product
so
sold.
for
apportionment
purposes,
though,
this
court
ruled
that
if
you've
got
the...
if
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
local
and
the
measure
is
reasonable,
that
the
tax
is
fairly
apportioned.
in
standard
pressed
steel,
the
court
ruled
that
the
tax
at
issue
in
this
case
was
apportioned
exactly
to
the
activities
taxed.
and
in
american
manufacturing
versus
st.
louis,
the
court
reached
the
same
conclusion
with
regard
to
a
manufacturing
tax.
now,
the
taxpayers
have
argued
in
their
brief
and
alluded
to
here
that
our
tax
must
be
malapportioned
because
we
consider
the
taxes
together
for
compensating
tax
purposes,
but
we
separate
them
for
purposes
of
our
apportionment
analysis.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
those
are
two
different
things.
for
example,
sales
and
use
taxes
are
considered
together
to
be
compensating
taxes,
but
for
apportionment
purposes
there's
never
been
any
suggestion
from
this
court
or
any
other
court
that
i'm
aware
of
that
has
said
a
retail
sales
tax
must
be
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
three
factors
or
any
other
number
of
factors.
the
point
is
those
decisions
of
this
court
sustaining
the
manufacturing
and
selling
taxes
fairly
apportioned
are
correct,
and
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
has
done
nothing
to
advance
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
taxes
aren't
correctly
apportioned.
the
only
thing
they've
done
is
said,
well,
there's
a
possibility
of
overlap
with
some
other
tax.
and
in
the
court's
decisions
in
moorman,
container,
and
even
armco,
the
possibility
of
some
overlap
does
not
render
a
tax
malapportioned.
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
nexus
question
raised
by
tyler
pipe.
tyler
pipe
basically
argued...
national
can
agrees
that
there
is
enough
nexus
under
the
due
process
and
commerce
clause
to
impose
our
tax
upon
them.
tyler
pipe
contests
the
nexus.
now,
tyler
pipe
sells
products
in
washington
through
the
use
of
independent
contractors
who
act
as
their
sales
representatives.
and
there's
really
two
questions:
do
the
activities
of
the
sales
representatives
give
rise
to
nexus
without
regard
to
what
their
status'
is?
and
the
second
question
is:
if
those
representatives
do
enough
to
give
rise
to
nexus,
does
it
make
any
difference
that
they're
independent
contractors.
the
lower
court
found
that
the
activities
were
enough,
and
this
court
has
ruled
in
decisions
such
as
scripto
versus
carson
that
the
contractual
tagging
of
a
sales
representative
doesn't
have
any
constitutional
significance.
now,
counsel's
argument
with
regard
to
nexus
really
broke
down
to
this.
he
said:
our
local
sales
representatives
pay
a
tax
and
tyler
pipe
pays
a
tax,
and
that
somehow
means
that
we
can't
tax
both
of
those.
and
i
want
to
sort
out
any
confusion
in
your
mind.
ashe
&
jones
pays
tax
under
the
service
classification.
they're
providing
a
service
business
of
representing
tyler
pipe.
tyler
pipe
pays
tax
on
its
activity
of
making
sales
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
fact
that
both
ashe
&
jones
and
tyler
pipe
pay
tax
is
irrelevant.
clearly,
this
court
would
not
have
a
rule
that
said
that
we
could
not
impose
this
tax
because
of
the
independent
contractor
nexus
and
yet,
if
we
went
back
to
our
state
and
repealed
the
tax
on
the
independent
contractors,
that
suddenly
there
would
be
enough
nexus
to
tax
them.
the
purpose
of
the
nexus
requirement
is
to
get
a
connection
between
the
taxpayer
and
the
state.
the
trial
court
in
this
case
found
that
the
activities
of
the
representatives
were
significantly
associated
with
the
taxpayer's
ability
to
establish
and
maintain
the
market.
the
taxpayer
does
three
kinds
of
things:
first,
they
solicit
sales:
secondly,
they
gather
virtually
all
of
the
market
information
from
washington
state
that's
used
by
tyler
pipe:
and
finally,
they
engage
in
various
market
maintenance
kinds
of
activities.
for
example,
they
make
secondary
calls
on
architects
and
engineers
trying
to
get
them
to
specify
tyler
pipe
products
in
their
engineering
specifications.
they're
available
to
help
when
there
are
shortages
of
shipments
or
there
is
breakage.
they're
the
first
line
evaluators
of
credit.
they
perform
significant
activities.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
really
any
dispute,
perhaps
a
bit
of
quibbling,
about
the
fact
that
these
activities
are
performed.
what
tyler
pipe
argues
is:
we
do
a
lot
of
stuff
in
texas,
too.
but
that's
not
what's
relevant
for
nexus,
the
fact
that
they
do
some
activities
in
texas.
what's
relevant
is
the
activities
that
they
do
in
washington.
and
the
trial
court
found,
and
it
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
that
they
engage
in
these
three
kinds
of
activities.
under
your
decision
in
northwest
portland
cement,
simply
solicitation
would
be
enough
to
impose
the
tax.
under
the
decision
in
standard
pressed
steel,
the
market
maintenance
activities
and
the
information
gathering
activities
would
be
sufficient
to
support
the
tax.
in
this
case
we
have
both.
no
question
that
the
activities
of
these
representatives
give
rise
to
nexus.
and
as
i
said
before,
there's
no
constitutional
significance
to
the
fact
that
they
are
independent
contractors
as
opposed
to
employees.
they
penetrate
the
market
in
exactly
the
same
way,
and
what
the
court
needs
to
focus
on
are
the
activities.
i
think
that's
the
learning
of
the
scripto
case.
there's
one
last
point
i
want
to
make
before
i
take
my
seat,
and
that
is
to
rule
in
favor
of
the
taxpayers
in
this
case
it'll
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
overrule
some
of
its
prior
decisions,
in
our
judgment.
and
if
the
court
does
that,
we
would
urge
it
to
make
its
decision
prospective.
in
that
case,
the
state
would
meet
the
three
criteria
for
prospective
application
in
a
civil
case
set
out
in
the
chevron
oil
decision.
and
of
course,
this
matter
is
very
significant
to
the
state.
1980
through
1984,
the
state
estimates
that
it's
worth
about
$423
million,
which
is
about
ten
percent
of
our
annual
budget.
and
of
course,
three
additional
years
have
gone
by
since
then.
however,
we
hope
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
reach
a
prospective
application
issue,
because
the
taxes
in
this
case
are
constitutional
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
manufacturing
and
selling
taxes
pass
the
bright
line
test.
everybody
pays
the
selling
tax.
the
manufacturing
tax
is
a
valid
compensating
tax
because
it
meets
the
criteria
of
equality.
in-state
and
out
of
state
taxpayers
are
treated
in
the
same
fashion.
the
tax
is
fairly
apportioned
under
your
decisions
and
there
is
sufficient
nexus
to
impose
the
tax
on
tyler
pipe.
accordingly,
we
would
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
washington
supreme
court
in
both
causes.
