mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
washington
is
using
the
same
set
of
facts
to
impose
a
tax
both
on
tyler
pipe,
who
is
before
the
court,
and
on
its
independent
representative,
ashe
&
jones,
who
is
not
before
the
court,
and
i
want
to
show
you
how.
tyler
pipe
manufactures
pipe
in
texas.
it
ships
pipe
throughout
the
united
states,
to
all
the
states.
it
advertises
nationally
and
uses
regional
shows
to
do
the
advertising.
it
sells
through
the
use
of
catalogues.
catalogues
are
distributed
to
all
its
customers.
its
customers
are
plumbing
suppliers.
that's
like
a
lumber
yard
except
it's
for
the
plumbing
business
instead
of
the
lumber
business.
in
the
state
of
washington,
tyler
has
an
independent
representative.
all
of
the
orders
that
tyler
pipe
receives
and
that
are
processed
in
the
state
of
texas
come
either
from
its
plumbing
supply
customers...
45
percent
of
them
come
directly
from
the
customers...
or
through
ashe
&
jones,
the
manufacturer's
representative.
55
percent
of
them
come
through
ashe
&
jones.
ashe
&
jones
has
no
inventory.
it
simply
has
employees
who
represent
out
of
state
manufacturers.
tyler
pipe
is
one
of
six
or
seven
such
out
of
state
manufacturers.
ashe
&
jones
has
three
and
a
half
employees.
that's
what
the
record
shows.
tyler
pipe's
share
would
be
about
a
half
of
a
person,
except
that
ashe
&
jones
also
represents
tyler
pipe
in
idaho,
montana,
the
western
provinces
of
canada,
and
alaska.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
ashe
&
jones
has
less
than
a
half
a
person
available
to
represent
tyler
pipe
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
both,
due
process
and
commerce
clause.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
i
can't
say
about
the
others.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
okay,
i
agree,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
it's
not
very
much.
ashe
&
jones
is
paid
a
commission
on
all
sales
by
tyler
pipe
into
the
state
of
washington.
the
testimony
in
the
case
is
that
tyler
pipe
operated
through
an
independent
representative
because
it
did
not
believe
it
had
sufficient
business
in
washington
to
justify
having
an
employee
in
that
state.
the
state
of
washington
taxes
the
gross
receipts
of
all
sales
that
go
into
the
state
of
washington.
it
also
taxes
the
commissions
that
are
paid
to
ashe
&
jones.
now,
it
just
doesn't
tax
them;
it
taxes
them
under
the
same
statute,
the
b&o
tax.
the
state
of
washington
makes
a
distinction
between
independent
contractors
like
ashe
&
jones
and
employees.
the
state
of
washington
is
using
the
same
set
of
facts
to
establish
nexus
for
ashe
&
jones
to
tax
the
commissions
it
receives
on
the
tyler
pipe
sales
in
washington
as
it
uses
to
establish
nexus
for
tyler
pipe
in
the
state
of
washington.
indeed,
the
state
of
washington
concedes
that,
absent
the
ashe
&
jones
activities
there
would
be
no
tyler
pipe
nexus
in
the
state
of
washington.
now,
let
me
turn
for
a
minute
to
apportionment.
substantially
all
of
the
activities
that
are
incurred...
a
large
percentage,
more
than
half
of
the
activities
that
are
incurred
in
the
wholesaling
activities
of
tyler
pipe
that
are
being
taxed
by
the
state
of
washington
occur
outside
of
the
state.
i
have
listed
on
pages
2
to
4
of
the
reply
brief
the
activities
that
occur,
and
only
two,
one
and
only
part
of
the
second,
occur
in
washington,
and
most
of
the
others
occur
in
texas.
yet,
the
state
of
washington
would
tax
the
wholesaling
activities
of
tyler
pipe
100
percent,
without
any
apportionment
for
the
activities,
commercial
activities
that
take
place
out
of
the
state.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
your
honor,
the
state
of
texas
uses
gross
receipts
in
its
formula
for
taxing
the
franchise
tax,
but
the
state
does
not
have
an
independent
gross
receipts
tax,
although
it
is
in
the
process
right
now...
one
has
been
proposed
for
this
congressional
enactment.
if
it's
enacted,
i
presume
we
no
longer
will
have
to
pay
the
state
of
washington
tax.
in
any
event,
most
of
the
activities
take
place
out
of
the
state.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
--we
are
being
taxed
in
the
state
of
texas
on
these
activities,
because
the
receipts
from...
well,
we
are
not...
in
the
state
of
texas,
the
franchise
tax
is
determined
by
a
ratio
between
the
gross
receipts
in
texas
and
the
gross
receipts
outside
the
state
of
texas.
in
fact,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe...
and
i
will
concede
that
we
were
not
during
the
taxing
period
taxed
on
these
sales,
simply
because
the
comptroller
at
that
time
did
not
examine
these
facts.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
there
was
none
in
fact
during
the
period,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
one
of
the
elements
of
the
commerce
clause
is
that
the
court
will
look
at
the
services
rendered
by
the
state
to
determine
whether
the
tax
is
fairly
applied
to
the
taxpayer.
in
this
instance,
the
state
says
that
it
is
providing
four
services.
the
state
says
that
it
is
providing
police
protection,
but
tyler
pipe
has
no
employees
in
the
state.
the
state
of
washington
says
that
it
is
providing
fire
protection,
but
tyler
pipe
has
no
property
within
the
state
of
washington.
the
state
of
washington
says
that
it
is
providing
other
services
of
a
civilized
society,
but
tyler
pipe
has
nobody
there
to
benefit
from
them.
the
one
benefit
which
the
state
of
washington
has
provided
to
tyler
pipe
is
access
to
the
court,
and
tyler
pipe
has
used
the
court
on
one
occasion
and
that
is
to
bring
this
case
to
avoid
an
oppressive
tax.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor,
have
paid
for
it
dearly.
thank
you.
tyler
pipe's
products...
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
asked
about
the
activities...
or
whether
the
tyler
pipe
was
taxed
on
its
gross
receipts,
and
i
said
no
and
that
is
correct,
they
are
not.
however,
we
had
viewed
and
do
view
the
law
of
this
court
that
we
do
not
have
to
establish
that
the
tax
is
in
fact
paid
in
another
state,
and
i
refer
to
the
adams
manufacturing
case
and
then
specifically
the
gwin,
white
case,
which
involved
the
state
of
washington
tax,
where
this
court
said
unlawfulness
of
the
burden
depends
upon
its
nature,
measured
in
terms
of
its
capacity
to
obstruct
interstate
commerce
and
not
on
the
contingency
that
some
other
state
may
first
have
subjected
the
commerce
to
a
like
burden.
and
that
was
an
apportionment
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
tax
on
gwin,
white,
who
would
have
been
equivalent
to
ashe
&
jones
in
our
case,
was
not
permissible
on
sales
going
outside
the
state.
now,
counsel...
i
thought
it
was
clear,
but
now
i
think
it
may
be
confused,
as
to
what
i
was
trying
to
do
about
showing
you
that
the
same
activities
were
used
for
nexus
for
two
different
taxpayers.
we're
using
the
actions
of
ashe
&
jones,
or
at
least
the
state
of
washington
is,
to
find
nexus
for
ashe
&
jones
and
to
find
nexus
for
tyler
pipe.
you've
never
done
that
before.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
i
think
not.
you're
using...
it's
never
been
done
before,
and
in
this
instance
you're
using
the
same
acts
to
establish
presence
for
two
different
people.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
well,
it
is
there
for
its
own
activities,
but
its
own
activities
are
tyler
pipe's
activities.
in
fact,
it
may
be
using...
the
state
may
be
using
nexus
for
eight
different
taxes,
because
there
are
six
or
seven
other
manufacturers
for
whom
ashe
&
jones
also
serves.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
no,
it's
not
contrary
to
agency
law.
i
say
it's
contrary
to
nexus
law.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
yes,
yes,
you
can
have
presence.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
an
independent
contractor
establishes
some
kind
of
wall.
yes,
i
do
not
say
that.
but
you
should
not
be
able
to
count
them
twice,
that's
all
i'm
saying.
and
this
court
has
never
before
done
that.
counsel
also
says
that...
lines
up
two
or
three
items
that
counsel
says
tyler
pipe...
ashe
&
jones
did
for
tyler
pipe
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
refer
you
to
pages
2
to
4
of
tyler
pipe's
reply
brief,
where
i
have
listed
the
activities
that
were
done
by
the
state
of...
by
ashe
&
jones
in
washington
and
the
activities
that
occurred
outside
the
state.
that
list
is
there
for
two
or
three
reasons.
one,
to
show
that
what
ashe
&
jones
is
doing
is
nothing
more
than
selling.
they
can
call
it
selling
or
marketing
or
whatever
else.
they
are
solicitors,
they
are
sellers,
and
that's
all
they
do.
they
can
use
all
the
facts
they
want
to
describe
that,
but
it
still
comes
out
selling.
i
could
probably
spend
ten
minutes
this
afternoon
telling
you
how
i
shaved
this
morning
and
with
all
the
details,
but
it's
still
just
shaving.
and
that's
all
that
ashe
&
jones
was
doing,
selling.
we
operated,
tyler
pipe
operated,
through
catalogues.
it
was
a
catalogue
operation
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
list
is
also
there
because
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
the
tax
is
improperly
apportioned
as
to
the
wholesaling
activity.
most
of
these
activities
were
outside
the
state
and
therefore...
and
the
state
of
washington
taxes
the
sales
in
washington
100
percent,
without
giving
any
credit
for
activities
outside
the
state.
in
the
standard
pressed
steel
case,
the
court
was
very
careful
to
point
out
that
all
of
the
activities
occurred
within
the
state.
it
is
also
there
to
demonstrate
that...
well,
that
isn't
demonstrated,
but
in
addition
the
fact
that
the
state
of
washington
provides
no
services
to
tyler
pipe
is
indicative
of
the
fact
that
tyler
pipe
has
no
nexus
in
washington.
now,
i
did
say
as
to
tyler
pipe
that
tyler
pipe
did
not
pay
a
tax
on
its
gross
receipts
outside
the
state
of
washington.
71
other
taxpayers
before
you,
i
believe
it
is
stipulated
that
they
did
do
manufacturing
outside
the
state
or
they
were
taxed
on
gross
receipts
or
other
activities
outside
the
state.
i
think
that's
a
stipulated
record.
one
reason
the
records
may
be
a
little
different
is
that
we,
that
tyler
pipe
tried
its
case
before
the
armco
case
and
the
71
other
cases
were
stipulated
following
the
armco
decision.
tyler
pipe
believes
that
it
does
not
have
nexus,
not
only
because
of
the
double
counting.
that's
just
one
incident.
there
are
many
other
reasons.
there's
your
case
of
norton.
the
norton
case
is
right
on
point.
in
norton,
norton
had
a
manufacturing
facility
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
near
worcester.
it
was
selling
into
the
state
of
indiana.
norton
had
a
store,
an
actual
store
with
inventory.
the
customers
came
to
the
store
and
bought
inventory.
if
some
of
the
items
were
not
there,
the
customer
would
then
order
them.
some
of
the
customers
ordered
directly
from
the
manufacturer
in
massachusetts.
the
court
held
that
all
shipments
directly
from
the
state
of
massachusetts
to
the
customer
in
indiana
were
not
subject
to
the
gross
receipts
tax
in
indiana
because
there
was
no
nexus
as
to
those
sales.
all
of
tyler
pipe
products
were
shipped
directly
from
tyler
pipe
to
the
customer.
ashe
&
jones
never
saw
a
piece
of
pipe.
they
were
loaded
on
an
interstate
commerce,
interstate
truck
in
tyler,
texas,
and
were
shipped
at
the
risk
of
the
buyer.
therefore,
the
tyler
pipe
has
no
connection
with
the
state
except
for
its
solicitors.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
found
or
held
to
date
that
solicitation
alone
does
justify
establishing
nexus.
if
it
has
held
that,
then
there
is
very
little
left
to
nexus.
but
i
do
not
think
there
are
any
cases
that
hold
that.
as
far
as
the
71
other
cases
are
concerned,
in
those
cases
there
was
either
manufacturing
in
the
state
and
wholesaling
outside
or
manufacturing
outside
the
state
and
wholesaling
within.
mr.
neil
j.
o'brien
thank
you.
