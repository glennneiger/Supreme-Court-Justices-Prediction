justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
has
yet
to
resolve
it
unless
it
resolved
it
in
the
armco
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
just
exactly
what
that
case
involved,
only
it's
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
taxes
were
of
differing
amounts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
collins,
isn't...
i
don't
know
where
this
exhibit
k
came
from
that
your
opponent's
entire
argument
was
based
on
that.
but
if
that's
a
valid
portrayal
of
what
would
happen
if
oregon
had
precisely
the
same
scheme
as
washington
had,
and
that's
the
out
of
state
system
here,
why
isn't
it
blatant
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
we
apply,
if
we
follow
these
cases,
we
have
to
overrule
that
case.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
how
do
you
distinguish
armco
and
this
case?
i
mean,
you
distinguish
on
the
amounts,
but
assuming...
do
you
think
west
virginia
could
cure
its
problem
by,
you
know,
a
look
at
the
diagrams
and
just
say,
we'll
now
impose
only
a
manufacturing
tax,
impose
a
manufacturing
tax
only
when
they
sell
out
of
state
and
impose
a
manufacturing
tax...
excuse
them
from
paying
the
manufacturing
tax
when
they
sell
in-state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
it's
the
other
way
around.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
get
excused
from
the
wholesale
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
that's
the
issue,
because
here
we
have...
but
i
know
you
cited
a
case
to
me,
but
why
is
it
not
true
that
if
you
had,
if
oregon
had
the
same
scheme
that
you
have
and
you
have
just
the
same
tax,
both
have
these
taxes,
why
is
it
not
true
that
the
local
commerce
is
taxed
less,
i
believe,
than
the
interstate
commerce?
it's
perfectly
clear
it
is
taxed
less
heavily,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
just
asking
you
if.
maybe
we
should...
i
know
there's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
pay
more
taxes
on
the
interstate
transactions
than
they
would
pay
on
the
intrastate
transactions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
difference
in
your
hypothetical
is
that
if
both
states
adopted
the
taxing
scheme
of
the
other,
they
would
pay
double
taxes
in
both
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would
be
no
discrimination
between
interstate
and
intrastate
taxation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
only
if
the
selling
tax
is
paid,
i
suppose
that's
the
equivalent
of
saying
only
if
the
sales
are
made
within
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
the
functional
equivalent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
they
did
prove
that
oregon
had
the
same
kind
of
tax
statute
that
you
have?
would
it
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
put
another
way,
assuming
we
agreed
with
your
argument
up
to
that
point
and
say
that
the
statute's
fine
today
and
then
tomorrow
oregon
passed
such
a
statute,
would
that
make
your
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
the
answer
is
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
if
the
fate
of
your
tax
depends
on
what
happens
in
the
oregon
legislature.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
curious
which
boat
it
is.
[laughter]
