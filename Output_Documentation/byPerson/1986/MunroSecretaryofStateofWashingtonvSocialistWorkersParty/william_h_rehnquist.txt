chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-656,
ralph
munro,
secretary
of
state
of
washington,
versus
socialist
workers
party.
mr.
johnson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
subsidizing
meaning
printing,
including
their
name
on
the
ballot?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sixty-five
candidates
for
what,
mr.
johnson?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
those
were
not
just
local
races.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
candidates
were
there
for
governor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
johnson,
i
feel
bound
to
inform
you
that
there
is
no
word
in
the
english
language
"irregardless".
the
word
is
"regardless".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
the
socialist
workers
party
position
would
be
that
the
issues
that
are
alive
and
well
and
being
debated
in
washington
aren't
the
ones
we
want
to
debate.
we
have
got
some
other
things
that
may
seem
odd
to
a
lot
of
people,
but
we
still
would
like
to
mount
our
little
campaign.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
they
get
their
votes
from
in
king
county
and
takoma?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
johnson.
mr.
smith,
we
will
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
referring
now,
mr.
smith,
to
the
statutory
requirements
for
the
convention?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
those?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
means
that
200
registered
voters
would
have
to
attend
the
convention?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
if
this
were
the
only
requirement
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot
you
wouldn't
be
challenging
it,
would
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
smith,
in
your
definition
of
serious
minor
party
when
you
were
replying
to
justice
marshall's
question,
i
gather
there
is
a
numerical
component
to
seriousness.
the
party
which
can
muster
only
ten
votes
at
its
convention,
it
may
have
ten
of
the
best
debaters
and
the
best
philosophers
in
the
state
of
washington
but
the
state
can
say
that
just
isn't
enough.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me
part
of
your
argument
is
that
our
cases
have
said
that
there
must
be
a
way
for
serious
minor
parties
to
get
on
the
ballot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
am
curious
to
know
whether
the
way
you
use
that
term
the
term
"serious"
can
at
least
be
construed
by
the
state
to
have
a
numerical
component.
that
is,
serious
minor
parties
who
can
muster
one-half
percent
of
the
turnout
at
the
last
election
for
that
office
at
some
stage
in
the
campaign,
just
take
hypothetically.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
let
me
get
back
again
to
something
i
think
i
asked
you
previously.
do
i
get
from
your
answers
to
my
questions
and
some
other
questions
that
a
numerical
requirement
to
get
on
the
ballot,
a
numerical
requirement
of
support
would
fail
of
constitutional
muster,
would
fall
to
pass
constitutional
muster
if
parties
such
as
the
socialist
workers
party,
as
it
has
been
in
washington,
couldn't
meet
that
requirement,
no
matter
what
the
requirement
was?
if
it
doesn't
let
a
party
like
the
socialist
workers
party
in
washington
on,
it
is
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
let
the
socialist
workers
party
on
but
not
the
libertarians?
they
couldn't
quite
make
the
numbers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
it
come
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
that
case
come,
out?
might
it
be
constitutional,
a
system
which
allowed
the
socialist
workers
party
but
not
the
libertarian
party
through
the
use
of
numbers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
socialist
workers
party
surely
make
an
effort
to
get
their
partisans
out,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
johnson,
did
you
have
something
more
to
say?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
johnson.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
