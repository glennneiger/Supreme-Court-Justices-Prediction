well,
of
course,
that
could
be
remedied
by
not
printing
them.
justice

i
don't
think
it
is
something
to
keep
emphasizing.
you
mention
it
every
other
minute.

mr.
smith,
would
you
accept
any
number?
suppose
the
state
said
you
have
to
have
at
least
100
votes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
somebody
has
a
convention
of
200
relatives
they
can
get
on
the
ballot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
a
person
could
during
20
years
of
his
life
run
every
two
years
and
get
less
than
ten
votes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
understand
the
question?
john
dokes
runs
for
congressman
ten
elections
in
a
row
and
never
got
more
than
ten
votes.
the
state
has
to
consider
him
as
a
serious
candidate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
obliged
to?
