justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
kind
of
information
disseminated
in
connection
with
the
primary
as
well
as
the
general
election?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
of
course
it
is
5
percent
of
something
different,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
was...
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
5
percent
was
required
for
the
major
party
candidate
to
got
on
the
ballot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
would
never
happen,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
contain
examples
of
this
pamphlet
you
describe
as
being
sent
out
to
the
voters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
reference
to
it
at
all
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
mean
in
the
record
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
have
just
told
us
about
it
for
the
first
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yet
this
was
one
of
the
major
things
they
were
saving
in
enacting
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
did
they
give
up?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
person
who
was
a
delegate
to
the
convention
couldn't
vote?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
couldn't
he?
if
the
convention
was
held
in
his
home
town,
couldn't
he
do
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
but
why
would
he
want
to
vote
in
a
primary
if...
i
don't
understand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
have
other
issues
like
bond
issues
and
things
like
that
on
your
primary
ballot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
1
percent
requirement
could
be
quite
different
in
an
election
which
had,
say
there
was
no
contest
for
the
democratic
nomination
and
no
contest
for
the
republican
nomination.
it
might
be
rather
easy
to
get
a
1
percent
then,
but
if
you
have
a
big
party
fight
going
on
and
a
lot
of
other
issues,
the
1
percent
would
then
be
ten
or
fifteen
times
as
hard
to
get.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
depends
on
what
the
issues
are
at
the
primary
election.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
you
have
placed
quite
a
bit
of
emphasis
on
the
fact
there
are
two
stages
that
have
to
be
met
by
your
party,
one,
a
convention,
which
is
rather
modest,
and
then
the
i
percent
primary
requirement.
supposing
the
state
said,
as
they
do
with
democrats
and
republicans,
anyone
may
get
on
the
primary
ballot,
just
eliminate
the
first
stage,
and
then
your
candidate
could
run
simply
on
that
and
have
to
meet
a
i
percent.
would
that
be
permissible,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
position
really
is
that
no
requirement
that
depends
on
an
independent
candidacy
getting
a
certain
number
of
votes
in
the
primary
would
be
permissible
because
the
function
of
a
primary
is
really
to
sort
out
the
major
party
candidates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
take
justice
marshall's
example.
say
it
said
100
votes.
you
have
to
get
100
votes
in
the
primary.
or
the
200
that
you
have
now
for
your
convention.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
given
you
the
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
exclude
all
those
that
couldn't
get
200
votes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
for
me,
because
i
am
wondering
whether
you
are
assuming
there
is
some
minimum
threshold
that
could
be
imposed
in
a
primary.
it
may
be
different
in
petitions.
i
understand
your
argument
about
that.
or
are
you
saying
that
the
primary
is
not
the
appropriate
vehicle
to
test
the
minimum
threshold
support,
and
can
never
be
used?
i
am
just
not
sure
what
your
position
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
should
never.
i
know
it
is
not
the
best.
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
to
use
a
primary
which
is
primarily
designed
for
another
purpose
to
satisfy
this
threshold
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
always
going
to
be
a
less
restrictive
alternative.
if
you
put
it
at
200,
it
could
have
been
100.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
the
constitutional
outcome
depends
on
the
empirical
results.
in
other
words,
the
non-statewide
candidates
who
could
get
the
1
percent,
it
is
perfectly
constitutional
as
to
them,
but
it
is
unconstitutional
as
to
those
who
can't
pass
the
threshold.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
could
have...
this
same
provision
might
have...
it
didn't
work
in
michigan,
i
know,
but
in
another
state
the
1
percent
might
be
okay
if
three
or
four
parties
could
meet
the
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
kind
of
local
community
standards
for
elections.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
65
to
50,
are
these
all
statewide
candidates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
a
different
pamphlet
for
each
election
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
each
congressional
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
