mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
when
we
analyzed
state
restrictions
on
political
expression
and
association
relating
to
minor
parties
with
dissident
views,
we
are
operating
in
the
core
of
the
first
amendment.
since
there
is
no
litmus
test
for
ballot
access
restrictions,
the
numbers
game
is
not
useful.
the
cases
do
not
say
1
percent
is
constitutional
or
an
early
deadline
is
unconstitutional,
so
to
decide
this
case
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
three
questions.
first,
did
the
1977
additional
restrictions
have
a
substantial
impact
on
expression
and
association
of
minor
parties
and
voters?
two,
is
there
a
governmental
interest
in
these
additional
restrictions
so
compelling
that
it
outweighs
the
burden
on
fundamental
first
amendment
rights?
and
three,
are
the
new
restrictions
precisely
drawn
so
that
first
amendment
rights
are
not
necessarily...
unnecessarily
burdened,
or
could
the
legitimate
state
interest
be
achieved
by
less
drastic
means?
i
would
like
to
address
these
in
order,
but
first
i
must
touch
on
the
most
crucial
aspect
of
washington's
ballot
access
amendments
of
1977.
this
was
the
conversion
of
the
traditional
one-step
barrier
as
it
applies
in
every
other
state
in
which
qualifying
candidates
participate
in
the
general
election
whether
they
are
a
minor
party
or
major
party
nominees
to
a
two-step
exclusionary
process.
now,
as
to
the
first
step,
as
mr.
johnson
has
discussed,
washington's
nomination
process,
by
convention,
is
different
from
a
door-to-door
petition
signature
requirement,
so
it
is
not
automatic
qualification.
far
from
it.
the
mounting
of
convention
does
require
substantial
effort,
and
in
1977
the
legislature
doubled
the
number
of
participants
required
with
the
result
that
the
nominees
that
have
been
able
to...
the
minor
parties
that
have
been
able
to
qualify
as
shown
by
the
table
on
page
5
and
6
of
our
brief
has
been
extremely
limited--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--correct.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
the
convention
requires
that
on
the
saturday
before
the
major
parties
even
have
to
declare
their
candidacy,
the
minor
party
has
to
gather
supporters
on
one
day
in
one
places
nominate
its
candidates,
and
have
a
nominating
petition
signed
by
a
number,
which
is
now
on
a
sliding
scaler
according
to
population,
approximately
200
at
this
time,
registered
voters
who
give
their
names
and
voting
addresses
attesting
to
the
nomination
of
that
candidate.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
that's
correct.
and
that
restriction
had
been
somewhat,
i
guess,
degenerating
by
the
increase
of
population,
and
the
legislature
remedied
that
problem.
previously
it
had
been
25.
it
had
been
raised
to
100.
in
1977
the
legislature
about
doubled
it,
and
now
it
is
tied
to
population.
since
that
change,
the
number
of
nominees
has
been
one,
two,
or
in
one
case
three,
and
so
we
are
talking
about
a
very
small
and
identifiable
group
of
dissident
parties
who
like
the
socialist
workers
party
and
the
libertarian
party
who
filed
the
amicus
brief
here,
who
consistently
over
the
years
have
put
forth
substantial
effort
into
the
electoral
system
to
introduce
their
new
ideas
to
the
voters
and
have
continued
to
be
able
to
qualify
candidates
in
very
small
numbers
by
convention.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
in
a
convention.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
as
an
independent
it
is
the
same
requirement
for
a
similar
convention.
you
have
to
organize
a
convention
to
support
your
independent
candidacy
and
get
the
signatures
of
the
same
number
of
voters.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
that's
correct,
and
we
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
historically
a
reasonable
but
small
number
of
serious
minor
parties
have
been
able
to
qualify,
and
since
this
has
been
adopted
have
still
been
able
to
nominate
candidates.
our
objection
is
that
these
nominees
who
have
qualified
are
then
universally
eliminated
by
the
primary
requirement,
and
as
mr.
johnson...
or
as
mr.
justice
stevens
brought
out,
it
is
a
different
situation
for
the
minor
parties
than
for
the
major
parties,
and
it
depends
not
primarily
on
the
level
of
support,
which
is
admittedly
small
because
by
definition
these
minor
parties
are
small
parties,
and
their
contribution
to
our
electoral
politics
does
not
depend
on
mass
support,
but
the
single
example
of
any
minor
party
candidate
that
has
been
able
to
meet
the
requirement
since
1977
has
been
one
race
where
there
was
only
a
single
democrat
and
a
single
republican
on
the
primary
ballot,
and
so
there
was
no
contest,
and
it
resembled
a
party
versus
party
choice,
and
in
that
situation
the
libertarian
party
candidate
for
treasurer,
a
relatively
low
profile
race,
but
was
able
to
get
the
1
percent.
with
that
exception,
when
there
was
no
contest,
every
time
there
has
been
a
contest
for
the
republican
or
democratic
nomination,
no
minor
party
candidate
has
ever
been
able
to
qualify
for
statewide
office.
it
has
been
a
blanket
exclusion,
as
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
found
the
record
indicates.
so
that
is
the
first
question
that
the
court
needs
to
address:
has
there
been
a
substantial
impact
on
the
participation
of
minor
parties
and
the
interest
that
that
affects
of
both
the
minor
parties
and
the
voters
in
injecting
their
ideas
into
the
electoral
system.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
well,
with
regard
to
the
first
question
you
ask,
justice
scalla,
whether
it
is
too
latitudinarian,
this
court
has
said
that
one
of
the
first
things
we
can
look
at
is
whether
in
practice
as
applied
minor
parties
are
able
to
qualify,
and
the
court
has
said
it
is
one
thing
if
minor
parties
are
regularly
able
to
qualify
for
the
ballot,
and
it
is
quite
another
thing
if
only
rarely
can
any
minor
party
get
on.
and
this
case
definitely
presents
the
situation
of
that
other
thing
where
minor
parties
are
systematically
barred.
with
regard
to
the
owl
party,
the
record
indicates
that
the
legislature
was
reacting
to
a
situation
where
they
were
offended
by
the
insufficient
reverence
that
the
owl
party
paid
to
the
major
parties,
and
particularly
and
ironically
to
the
level
of
public
support
that
the
owl
party
was
able
to
get,
and--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--yes,
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
serious
minor
parties
have
been
regularly
able
to
meet
the
nominating
convention
requirement
would
be
adequate
support
for
that
requirement
to
withstand
any
attack
by
somebody
else
who
was
not
able
to
meet
it
to
say
the
fact
that
these
small
but
serious
minor
parties
are
able
to
meet
this
requirement
indicates
it
is
fair.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
the
historical
record
indicates
that
that
is
not
a
problem,
that
has
never
happened
in
the
state
of
washington,
and
that
there
is
no
support
on
the
record
for
the
fear
that
that
might
happen,
especially
not
if
the
remedy
for
such
a
hypothetical
fear
should
be
such
areal
and
drastic
and
devastating
impact
on
the
few
minor
parties
who
need
this
route
to
the
ballot.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
well,
i
believe
if
the
state
wants
to
let
people
on
without
mounting
the
substantial
effort
that
the
convention
requires,
that
the
state
may
make
that
choice
to
open
its
ballot
to
those
kinds
of
candidates,
but--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--we
are
not
suggesting
that
it
is
obliged
to.
we
are
suggesting
that
when
it
has
got
this
first
stage
requirement
which
already
limits
the
ballot
to
a
small
number
of
serious
parties,
to
add
the
second
stage,
which
totally
wipes
them
off
the
ballot,
is
not...
first
of
all,
has
a
drastic
impact,
and
second,
is
not
necessary.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
well,
the
hypothetical
question
is
not
posed
in
this
case
because
we
have
a
real
situation
in
which
there
is
a
real
and
substantial
requirement
to
qualify.
if
we
didn't
have
this
historical
experience
and
we
had
to
hypothesize
in
the
dark,
the
state
could
test
out
a
requirement
and
see
if
serious
parties
could
qualify.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
well,
it
depends
on
what
the
requirement
is,
because
the
numerical
requirements
for
petition
signatures,
which
are
the
only
requirements
that
have
been
upheld
by
this
court,
do
represent
some
level
of
organizational
ability
and
diligence
that
the
party
itself
can
control
and
go
out
and
get
signatures
on
the
petitions,
in
jenness,
for
example.
we
are
not
saying
we
will
vote
for
this
candidate,
but
we
think
that
this
candidate
should
be
allowed
on
the
ballot,
and
because
of
the
traditional
american
openness
to
hearing
different
points
of
view,
it
is
very
easy
to
get
people
to
go
out
and
say,
yes,
we
believe
you
should
be
allowed
to
be
heard,
and
in
american
party
versus
texas,
the
socialist
workers
party
went
out
and
got
22,000
plus
signatures
on
their
petition
to
get
on
the
ballot
without
a
serious
problem
but
by
their
diligence
and
by
their
effort.
and
the
vote,
on
the
other
hand,
as
the
record
indicates,
reflects
the
primary
contest
by
the
major
parties
and
not
the
diligence
or
the
efforts
put
out
by
the
minor
party
within
their
limited
capabilities,
but
that
is
more
related
to
the
contribution
a
party
can
make
to
the
debate
that
they
are
capable
of
organizing
and
organizational
effort
like
that
to
gather
petition
signatures
than
to
make
it
rely
on
having
some
certain
level
of
support
in
the
primary
election
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one
is
that
the
primary
is
not
an
adequate
forum
as
a
substitute
for
the
general
election.
first
of
all,
the
timing
is
prior
to
the
identification
of
the
candidates
by
the
nominating
process
of
the
major
parties.
second,
as
in
this
race,
there
are
numerous,
often
dozens
of
major
party
candidates
that
still
have
to
be
selected
by
the
party
for
who
is
going
to
represent
them,
and
so
that
if
there
is
any
confusion,
which
mr.
johnson
identified
as
the
interest
the
state
is
concerned
about,
it
takes
place
at
the
primary,
as
in
this
case
with
32
democrats
and
republicans
on
the
ballot
along
with
a
single
socialist
workers
party
candidate.
the
voting
machine
has
no
instruction
on
that
of
what
even
the
purpose
of
the
minor
party
candidate
is
on
the
ballot,
and
if
the
minor
parties
are
going
to
make
a
contribution
to
the
election
process,
it
is
not
because
they
are
likely
to
win,
but
because
in
the
debate
between
the
representatives
of
the
parties
they
have
some
new
ideas
and
they
have
a
differing
point
of
view.
that
is
really
not
relevant.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
i
think
that
is
probably
correct
if
the
state's
interest
that
it
is
asserting
against
socrates
is
that
the
voters
would
be
confused
and
the
ballot
would
be
crowded,
and
the
democrats
and
republicans
say
you
cannot
be
the
third
candidate
on
our
ballot
because
that
would
confuse
the
voters
and
crowd
the
ballot,
i
think
socrates
should
win
in
that
case.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
that
is
because
of
the
experience
that
with
no
requirement
whatsoever
substantial...
some
modicum
of
support
is
a
fair
requirement
to
avoid
the
problems
of
ballot
crowding
and
voter
confusion,
and
in
this
case
we
have
such
a
legitimate
interest
being
taken
care
of
by
one
mechanism.
the
question
is
whether...
how
far
beyond
that,
to
get
the
owl
party,
whether
you
can
employ
your
shotgun
that
wipes
out
every
other
party
totally
off
the
ballot.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
substantial
support
is
not
required
as
an
end
in
itself,
number
one,
but
number
two,
if
it
is
of
a
reasonably
low
level
that
it
allows,
consistently
allows
serious
minor
party
candidates
to
qualify,
then
the
cases
say
you
haven't
met
the
threshold
of
showing...
the
first
step
is
showing
a
substantial
impact
on
diversity.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
the
record
in
the
state
of
washington
is
that
there
are
a
small
number
of
minor
parties
that
have
regularly
qualified
candidates
for
the
ballot,
like
the
socialist
workers
party,
like
the
libertarian
party,
and
what
the
legislative
history
indicates
is
that
the
frivolous
parties
that
were
allegedly
targeted
were
ones
with
no
serious
program
and
no
solutions
to
offer
the
people,
and
the
record
indicates
that
they
were
specifically
irritated
by
the
owl
party,
and
unfortunately
used
an
ax
when
they
should
have
used
a
scalpel.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
i
would
say
if
it
doesn't
let
any
party...
if,
like
this
case,
it
lets
no
party
outside
the
democratic
and
republican
party
qualify
for
the
ballot,
it
is
clearly
unconstitutional
if--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--well,
then
it
would
be
a
harder
case
than
this
one
is.
whatever
the--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--well,
whatever
the
number
is,
it
cannot
be
zero
as
a
reasonable
number.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
i'd
say
if
another
small
party
could
meet
a,
for
example,
a
petition
signature
requirement
which
could
be
met
through
reasonable
diligence,
then
it
would
be
constitutional
to
say
your
failure
to
exercise
that
diligence
to
gather
the
relatively
reasonable
number
of
signatures
that
other
small
parties
are
able
to
gathers
then
you
are
responsible
for
your
own
fate.
that
is
not
the
case
we
have
here
today.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
we
suggest
that
it
would
not
for
the
reasons
that
i
mentioned
earlier
why
the
primary
election
is
not
an
adequate
forum
for
minor
parties.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
well,
if
it
was
a
requirement
that
was
not
so
high
that
it--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--well,
for
example,
if--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--okay.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
if
it
had
no
substantial
exclusionary
effect
on
all
minor
parties,
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
well,
as
a
practical
matter
i
think
that
this
is
a
hypothetical
question
which
does
not
require
answering
to
decide
this
case,
and
it
is
unlikely
to--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--i
suggest
that
the
primary
should
never
be--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--i'd
say
it
is
analogous
to
the
cases
of
the
court
on
filing
fees,
that
there
is
a
less
restrictive
alternative
of
the
petition
signatures,
and
therefore
if
it
has
a--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--well,
if
the
state
aims
that
are
being
accomplished
are
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
ballot,
then
you
cannot
use
a
system
that
heavily
burdens
the
first
amendment.
if
a
reasonable
number
of
serious
minor
parties
are
able
to
meet
the
requirement,
then
you
are
not
causing
the
harm
of
wiping
the
slate
clean
of
all
but
the
two
major
parties
and
creating
a
monopoly.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
that's
correct,
you
have
to
show
the--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--that's
correct.
you
have
to
show
the
harm
as
applied,
and
this
court
has
always
sale
you
have
to
look
at
the
impact,
you
can't
look
at
the
abstract.
you
have
to
look
at
the
impact,
which
depends
on
the
historical
record,
and
so
has
universally
rejected--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--well,
this
court
has
rejected
facial
challenges
and
said,
you
have
to
look
at
the
impact
on
the
actual
community,
and
that
if
a
monopoly
is
the
result,
that
is
impermissible.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
the
court
of
appeals
decision
interpreted
the
washington
statute,
which
says
that
an
unsuccessful
minor
party...
or
an
unsuccessful
primary
participant
cannot
be
a
write-in
candidate
to
say
that
the
write-in
was
not
available
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
followed
the
decisions
of
this
case
saying
that
a
write-in
vote
is
not
a
constitutionally
accepted
alternative
to
general
election
ballot
placement.
the
state
has
argued
that
this
only
applies
to
major
parties,
even
though
there
is
no
specific
limitation
in
the
statutory
language,
and
also
the
record
indicates
that
the
election
results
reported
by
the
secretary
of
state
show
no
write-in
votes
for
any
of
the
offices
that
they
have
ever
reported
the
election
results
in
on
the
record,
and
so
the
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
that
is
either
that
nobody
ever
exercises
a
write-in
vote
or
the
secretary
of
state
doesn't
keep
track
of
them,
but
in
either
case
they
are
not
a
sufficient
substitute
for
the
participation
in
the
campaign,
the
debate,
and
the
presentation
of
their
ideas,
in
the
same
way
this
voters'
pamphlet
that
was
brought
up
by
mr.
johnson
for
the
first
time,
there
is
no
showing
of
any
financial
burden
on
the
record
here
that
to
add
an
extra
paragraph
to
a
30-page
pamphlet
would
put
some
burden
on
the
state
or
would
unfairly
or
unreasonably
subsidize
the
minor
parties
by
broadening
the
choices
available
to
the
voters.
we
suggest
that
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
contribution
that
minor
parties
should
be
playing
in
this
election
campaign.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
well,
historically
the
record
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
johnson
indicates
that
choosing
the
1
percent
level,
the
state
has
chosen
a
level
that
is
higher
than
90
percent
of
the
minor
parties
have
ever
been
able
to
get,
even
in
the
general
election,
so
they
have
chosen
a
level
that
is
up
at
the
90th
percentile
instead
of
choosing
a
level
from
the
record
that
was
down
at
the
50th
or--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--well,
first
of
all,
only
one-third
of
the
voters
even
are
interested
in
enough
in
the
primary
to
participate,
and
those
are
typically
partisans
of
one
of
the
major
party
candidates
who
care
about
what
the
primary
is
about,
namely,
which
major
party
candidate
will
get
the
nomination.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
this
is
not
a
randomly
selected
smaller
number.
it
is
a
number
selected
from
partisans
of
the
major
parties.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
that's
correct,
and
we
are
saying
that
this
is
not
only
unfair
in
its
mode
but
also
that
it
should
not
be
required
that
voters
make
a
commitment
at
that
primary
stage
to
the
socialist
workers
party
candidate
to
allow
a
small
number
of
candidates
to
participate
in
the
general
election,
and
that--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--well,
the
socialist
workers
party
has
made
that
effort,
and
$1,900
may
not
be
very
much,
as
mr.
johnson
says,
but
it
is
a
lot
of
leaflets,
and
it
is
certainly
not
a
prime
time
television
ad
that
goes
statewide
the
way
the
major
parties
can
put
on.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
well,
because
the
first
amendment
and
the
recognized
role
of
minor
parties
in
the
election
process
does
not
depend
on
a
large
measure
of
support,
and
the
abolitionists,
the
prohibitionists--
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
--and
we
suggest
that
if
the
interest
they
assert
of
confusing
the
voters
and
having
ballot
crowding
is
the
justification
for
a
monopoly
by
the
minor
parties,
then
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
returning
washington
to
the
system
that
had
worked
so
well
for
70
years
and
saying
that
monopoly
is
not
justified
on
the
record
here
by
any
demonstrated
history
of
ballot
crowding
and
voter
confusion,
which
is
the
burden
of
the
state
to
establish.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
that
would
perpetuate
the
monopoly,
especially
when
there
is
the
reasonable
alternative
in
the
convention
and
petitions.
mr.
daniel
hoyt
smith
well,
because
they
have
been
excluded
from
the
general
election,
there
is
no
way
they
can
get
the
1
percent
at
the
general
election
and
it
is
a
closed
door
for
the
minor
parties.
