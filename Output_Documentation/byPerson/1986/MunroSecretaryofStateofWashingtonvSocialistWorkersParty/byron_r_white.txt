why,
then,
do
you
suppose
the
minor
parties
have
had
such
bad
luck
under
this
new
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
true,
isn't
it?
weren't
they
more
frequently
on
the
ballot
before
this
law
was
changed?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
extent
their
analysis...
they
should
have
looked
more
broadly,
but
their
narrow
look
was
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
since
the
law
was
changed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wasn't
suggesting
that
the
experience
of
the...
that
the
state
had
to
allow
the
same
access
to
the
general
ballot
as
they
had
had
before
this
new
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
whether
this
new
law
is
constitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
feel
obligated
to
tell
you
that
my
name
is
white.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
again,
you
probably
stated
it
before,
but
tell
me
why
the
socialist
workers
party
isn't
able
to
get
the
requisite
votes
at
the
primary.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is...
what
you
say
may
be
correct,
but
what
i
asked
you
is,
why
haven't
the
socialist
party
or
the
other
minor
parties
been
able
to
get
the
requisite
votes
at
the
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is...
the
one-third
are
the
ones
that
the
major
parties
make
an
effort
to
get
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
you
be...
why
isn't
it
fair
to
say
if
you...
why
don't
you
just
get
out
your
supporters
and
hope
that
they
will
add
up
to
1
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
wrong
with
saying
if
you
can't
get
your
people
out
you
don't
get
on
the
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
first
amendment
requires...
forbids
a
state
to
require
a
showing
of
1
percent.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
also
say
if
washington
said
the
only
minor
parties
who
can
get
on
the
next
general
election
is
one
that
got
1
percent
of
the
vote
at
the
last
general
election,
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
there's
a
lot
of
people
out
at
the
general
election.
