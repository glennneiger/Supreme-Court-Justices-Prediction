mr.
james
m.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state
of
washington
has
a
uniquely
open
election
system,
a
system
unusually
hospitable
to
new
and
minor
parties
and
independents
and
their
candidates.
washington
voters
wishing
to
exercise
their
right
to
politically
associate
through
these
vehicles
easily
organize
and
choose
their
candidates.
those
candidates
have
long
been
automatically
placed
on
the
washington
elections
ballot.
after
a
1976
election,
with
the
most
crowded
ballot
in
washington's
history,
the
washington
legislature
decided
to
exercise
what
this
court
has
called
a
state's
undoubted
right
to
require
candidates
to
make
a
showing
of
substantial
support
in
order
to
qualify
for
a
place
on
the
ballot.
the
washington
legislature,
by
statute,
placed
all
candidates
on
the
primary
ballot
and
added
a
requirement
that
any
candidate
not
able
to
attract
the
votes
of
1
percent
of
the
voters
would
not
remain
on
the
ballot
a
second
time.
it
is
that
1
percent
requirement
to
remain
on
the
ballot
a
second
time
that
is
challenged
here
by
a
candidate
placed
on
the
washington
primary
ballot
who
got
fewer
than
600
votes,
less
than
one-tenth
of
the
1
percent,
and
thus
was
not
remained
on
the...
did
not
remain
on
the
washington
ballot
a
second
time
in
the
general
election.
i
shall
explain
first
the
washington
experience
and
the
election
with
its
crowded
ballot
in
1976
leading
to
this
change,
then
telling
you
why
the
1
percent
is
consistent
with
this
court's
numerical
definitions
of
substantial
support
and
argue
under
this
court's
decision
the
washington
requirement
is
neither
unconstitutional
per
se
and
is
less
than
the
numerical
test
that
this
court
has
approved,
such
as
the
jenness
v.
fortson,
a
5
percent
of
voters
test,
arguing
that
it
is
less
burdensome
on
minor
parties
and
serves
to
improve
the
political
debate
which
is
the
constitutional
issue
before
the
court;
finally...
and
also
that
the
washington
statute
by
cutting
off
some
few
candidates
avoids
subsidizing
hopeless
candidates,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
different
case
of
buckley
v.
valeo
was
appropriate.
finally,
i
can
show--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--there's
more
than
that
in
the
state
of
washington,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
printing
on
the
ballot
and
the
counting
of
votes
is
one
issue.
washington
is
also
unique
in
the
states
that
we
print
and
distribute
to
every
residence
in
washington
a
voter's
pamphlet
and
candidates'
pamphlet
for
publicizing
the
election
and
the
candidates,
at
considerable
expense.
in
that
additional
regard,
i
think,
we
are
subsidizing
hopeless
candidates
by
placing
on
the
ballot
those
candidates
that
have
not
and
will
not
receive
any
substantial
support.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
it
is
not,
justice
stevens.
it
is
only
disseminated
in
conjunction
with
the
general,
and
may
have
been
one
factor
in
the
legislature
determination
to
move
this
substantial
support
determination
to
the
primary.
i
referred
to
washington's
uniquely
open
system.
i
shortly
explain,
and
explain
the
relevance
of
this
system.
in
washington
there
is
no
party
registration.
there
is
no
identification
of
voters
by
party
in
the
state
of
washington
at
all.
the
voting
is
a
blanket
primary,
we
have
referred
to
it,
and
the
general
is
the
same.
under
a
blanket
voting
system
each
washington
voter
may
vote
for
any
candidate
for
any
position
irregardless
of
party
affiliation.
one
vote
per
race,
of
course.
in
a
case
tomorrow
arising
from
connecticut
you
will
hear
debated
the
merits
of
open
versus
closed
primaries
and
restrictions
on
voters,
how
they
vote
by
party.
in
washington
we
have
no
such
system.
the
washington
system
is
more
open
than
the
open
primary.
this
has
direct
relevance,
of
course,
to
using
a
primary
vote
requirement
for
determining
substantial
support,
since
any
washington
voter
attracted
to
the
votes
can
vote
for
any
and
all
candidates.
for
example,
a
washington
voter
may
choose
to
vote
for
a
socialist
worker
candidate
for
governor,
a
republican
candidate
for
u.s.
senate,
a
democrat
candidate
for
their
local
legislatures,
et
cetera,
down
the
ballot.
thus
again
the
primary
test
is
much
easier
than
it
would
be
in
most
states
with
either
a
closed
or
open
primary
in
which
party
affiliation
is
somehow
tested
first
before
the
voters
can
exercise
their
option.
finally,
in
washington
if
any
candidate
is
not
on
the
ballot
a
washington
voter
can
write
in
any
candidate
with
the
sole
exception
of
a
sore
loser
of
a
major
party
primary.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
regard
is
just
confused.
the
district
court
finding
of
fact
and
conclusion
of
law
at
jsc
5
is
accurate.
the
washington
statute
allows
write-ins
with
the
sole
exception
i
have
mentioned.
if
not
on
the
ballot,
of
course,
in
the
washington
system
the
voters
have
made
that
decision.
in
1976
the
voters
had
lots
of
options
to
choose
from,
culminating
the
preceding
four
elections'
increase
in
the
number
of
independent
and
minor
candidates.
the
1976
election
had
12
parties,
one
of
which,
the
owl,
out
with
logic,
on
with
lunacy,
party,
was
avowedly
frivolous
and
ran
a
statewide
slate.
there
were
numerous
candidates,
however,
as
noted
in
our
brief,
65
of
them
on
that
ballot.
important
to
note,
though,
is
that
of
these--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--sixty-five
candidates
for
statewide
and
congressional
races,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
that
does
not
include
local
races,
no.
that
is
summarized
in
the
appendix.
it
is
a
confusing
number,
confusing
in
this
particular
regard.
it
includes
all
the
congressional
candidates,
and
every
washington
voter
did
not
have
access
to
those,
so
each
voter
would
have
faced
probably
12
fewer,
and
then
added
to
the...
at
the
end
of
the
ballot
would
have
been
the
local
races
together
with
such
issues
as
constitutional
and
levy
elections.
it
was
a
long--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--there
were
eight
candidates
for
governor,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
a
good
example
of
showing
that
the
candidates,
the
non...
the
minor
party
independents
did
not
attract
any
substantial
support.
of
those
six
independent
and
minor
party
candidates,
none
of
them
got
1
percent
in
the
general
election.
four
of
them,
including
the
socialist
workers
party
candidate,
got
less
than.3
percent
of
the
ballot.
this,
by
the
way,
was
also
consistent
with
the
preceding
history
in
washington
of
minor
parties
and
independents.
as
noted
in
our
reply
brief,
since
the
depression,
only
two
such
candidates
for
statewide
office
had
ever
received
even
1
percent
of
the
vote.
the
washington
legislature
reasonably
then
saw
this
unduly
lengthy
ballot,
and
as
we
have
discussed,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
regards
to
the
voters'
pamphlet,
i
think
reasonably
concluded
that
in
some
regard
the
ballot
placement
and
the
voters'
pamphlet
were
subsidizing
hopeless
candidates,
and
the
"subsidizing
hopeless
candidates"
is
your
language--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--yes,
but
much
to
the
detriment
of
the
voting
system,
at
least
in
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
and
the
citizens
of
washington,
justice
marshall.
the
voters'
pamphlet
serves
to
publicize
all
the
election
as
well
as
helping--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--justice
marshall,
as
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
i
think
the
public
is
not
obligated
to
undertake
public
financing
of
elections.
that
quote
was
extracted
because
i
think
the
concepts
are
similar
in
that
one
regard.
the
encumbering
of
the
ballot,
however,
remains
irregardless
of
whether
a
voters'
pamphlet
is
chosen.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
thank
you,
chief
justice.
thank
you.
and
regardless,
the
problem
of
an
encumbered
ballot
as
existed
in
1976
remains.
the
washington
legislative
solution
to
that
problem
and
to
this
court's
then
recent
decisions
in
jenness
and
american
party
of
texas,
recognizing
that
the
state
had
the
authority
to
remove
frivolous
candidates
or
remove
those
that
had
no
public
support,
the
legislature
reacted
in
these
ways.
all
candidates
were
placed
on
the
primary
with
an
essentially
concurrent
filing
for
minor
party
and
independents
and
the
major
parties.
that
is,
the
convention
for
minors
and
independents
is
a
saturday,
monday
the
filing
begins,
and
on
the
friday
of
the
same
week
the
convention
certificate
together
with
the
major
party
are
closed.
one
percent
requirement
was
imposed.
any
candidate
not
getting
1
percent
would
not
remain
on
the
ballot.
important
to
note,
this
was
down
from
the
preceding
5
percent
requirement.
the
preceding
5
percent,
of
course,
applied
only
to
major
parties
who
in
the
earlier
system
were
the
only
ones
on
the
primary
ballot.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
no,
the
5
percent
before,
justice
stevens,
was
also
applied
to
the
primary
vote.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
this
was
in
the
washington
system
before
the
legislative
change.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
it
was.
a
major
party
candidate
not
getting
even
5
percent
would
not
remain
on--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--the
record
here
does
not
show
that.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
i
don't
believe
there
is
such
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
there
is
reference
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
i
think
there
is
not.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
pardon?
it
is,
however--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--i
think
it
is
in
the
legislative
history,
a,
justice
stevens,
and
it
is
a
statutory
requirement
of
which
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
knowledge.
in
washington
code
2981
140,
which
as
i
noted
requires
its
preparation
and
distribution
to
all
residences.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
justice
scalia,
i
do
not
understand...
first,
the
nominating
convention
requirement
was
not
challenged
below,
nor
do
i
understand
the
party
here
to
object
or
to
prefer
primary
nomination
for
its
candidates.
in
this
regard,
the
minor
parties
have
an
advantage
over
major
parties,
and
it
makes
some
sense
for
minor
or
new
parties.
they
can
control
their
own
candidate
rather
than
going
through
the
blanket
primary
system
to
allow
all
washington
voters
to
choose
their
candidates.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
i
think,
but
mr.
smith
may
best
address
whether
this
is
preferred
by
the
party.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
the
legislative
record
does
not
show
that.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
printed
as
a1
in
our
reply
brief,
in
that
appendix
the
legislative
memorandum
mentions
the
question
of
minor
parties
being
allowed
to
not
control
their
own
candidates
and
convention,
which
suggests
to
me
the
argument
i
have
just
advanced,
that
what
was
intended
was
to
let
them
at
the
smaller
stage
not
have
the
general
election...
the
major
parties
in
washington
sometimes
object
to
the
primary
system
we
have,
which
allows
all
voters
to
determine
a
party's
nominees.
and
i
think
the
analysis
is
more
likely
to
be
applied
in
a
small
and
growing
party
that
would
like
to
control
its
own
candidates.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
i
do
understand
that,
and
i
think,
justice
scalia,
the
answer
in
part
is
the
washington
system.
the
primary
serves...
on
the
primary
ballot
in
washington
are
not
just
candidate
nominations
but
local
races,
nonpartisan
races,
together
with
local
issues
such
as
levies
and
those
kinds
of
things.
the
burden
imposed
on
a
minor
party
candidate
is
exactly
the
same
as
any
candidate.
they
have
to
bring
out
voters
and
get
them
to
vote
for
them.
in
the
washington
system
the
beauty
for
a
minor
party
is
that
every
voter
that
comes
to
the
polls
can
vote
for
the
minor
party
candidate,
as
i
mentioned.
in
a
blanket
primary
they
don't
have
to
just
attract...
any
voter
that
walks
into
that
poll
can
vote
for
one
of
the
candidates.
typically,
by
the
way,
the
minor
party
doesn't
run
a
whole
slate
of
candidates.
in
this
regard
it
also
has
two
advantages
over
the
prior
system.
first,
the
old
system
had
the
convention
the
same
day
as
the
primary,
and
so
you
had...
a
minor
party
adherent
had
to
give
up
their
primary
right
to
go
to
the
convention.
in
this
regard
it
is
a
direct
benefit.
secondly--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--in
the
old
system,
justice
stevens,
you
had
to
go
to
the
convention
the
same
day
as
the
primary
and
could
not
vote
in
the
primary.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
yes.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
the
statute
prohibited
it.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
there
are
lots
of
other
issues
on
the
primary,
justice
stevens,
than
this
nomination.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
typically
a
small
party,
and
this
case
has
several
examples,
only
nominates
for
a
couple
of
races.
under
the
old
system--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--and
you
can
go
to
the
primary
and
vote
for
the
socialist
workers'
candidate
for
governor
or
legislator
and
also
vote
for
the
other
party--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--justice
stevens,
it
depends
on
the
position.
in
our
most
recent
race--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--and
the
position.
in
our
most
recent
primary,
the
hotly
contested
race
for
u.s.
senator,
but
if
the
socialist
workers
had
a
candidate
for
a
legislative
race
any
place
down
the
ballot,
all
the
voters
that
are
attracted
to
that
hot
race,
as
you
called
it,
could
vote
for
that
position
also.
it
has...
the
system
has
another
advantage
over
either
the
petition
or
the
prior
system
in
that
it
added
the
minor
parties
and
independents
into
the
political
debate.
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
is
broadening
the
political
debate,
and
under
the
prior
system
or
any
other
system
the
minor
parties
and
independents
have
no
role
in
the
period
of
debate
in
washington
leading
up
to
the
primary
because
they
are
not
on
the
ballot.
in
that
regard
the
primary
is
actually
monopolized
by
the
major
parties
if
they
are
the
only
ones
on
the
ballot.
by
adding
them
into
the
ballot
there
is
at
least
this
advantage,
if
not
to
the
party,
and
i
think
it
is
to
the
party,
there
is
the
advantage
to
the
voters
in
the
political
debate
that
they
are
allowed
in.
the
primary
system
that
it
is
not
per
se
unconstitutional,
we
can
say
at
least
from
this
court's
summary
affirmance
in
allen
v.
austin
in
1977
of
such
a
system.
indeed,
since
that
was
summary
affirmance,
i
suppose
that
is
the
most
i
can
say,
that
it
is
not
unconstitutional
per
se.
that
it
is
numerically
consistent
with
the
then
recent
cases
of
jenness
v.
fortson
and
american
party
of
texas
we
have
pointed
out
in
the
table
in
the
brief,
the
example
being
the
jenness
system,
in
which
this
court
approved
a
petition
requirement
of
5
percent
of
the
registered
voters
in
georgia.
such
a
requirement
imposed
in
the
state
of
washington
would
mean
122,000
signatures
to
get
the
statewide
gubernatorial
candidate
of
a
minor
party
on
the
ballot
in
washington,
as
contrasted
with
the
9,100
required
as
1
percent
of
the
primary
vote
in
1984.
now,
it
may
be
more
difficult
to
get
one
voter
out
to
vote
in
a
primary,
but
i
submit
it
is
not
13
times
more
difficult
to
get
a
voter
than
it
is
to
get
a
petition.
i
further
argue
that
the
political
debate
benefits
by
the
choice.
in
this
regard
the
primary
system
is
better
than
a
petition.
after
all,
the
petition,
once
filled
in,
the
petitions
are
discarded.
the
buttonholing
of
candidates,
which
one
of
the
amicus...
excuse
me,
the
buttonholing
of
voters,
which
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
suggest
is
a
real
easy
way
to
get
petitions
that
is
probably
true,
but
it
adds
little
to
the
political
debate,
as
contrasted
with
the
washington
system,
as
i
have
noted,
which
encourages
the
same
time
and
money
and
effort
to
be
expended
instead
in
attracting
voters
to
the
primary
and
getting
them
there
to
vote
for
their
candidates.
the
limited
resources
of
a
minor
party,
i
suggest,
are
better
expended
in
getting
voters
out
and
getting
them
to
the
primary
than
they
are
through
this,
to
us,
to
washington,
basically
meaningless
petition-gathering
proposition,
meaningless
in
the
sense
it
doesn't
really
add
to
the
political
debate,
which
is
the
issue,
the
interest
that
we
are
trying
to
protect.
i
also--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--there
are
three
reasons,
and
by
the
way--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--justice
white,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
says
that,
and
i
think
they
are
applying
the
wrong
historical
analysis.
they
improperly
limited
their
consideration
to
only
statewide
offices
and
only
minor
parties,
implicitly
assuming
that
the
right
involved
is
a
right
of
candidacy.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
the
statistics
were
correct,
with
the
exception
that
they
were
numerically
wrong
about
independents.
independents
statewide
have
actually
placed
four
out
of
five
candidates
on
the
general
election.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
since
the
law
was
changed.
what
we
are
looking
for,
though,
is
not...
we
are
not
trying
to
accommodate
rights
of
candidates,
because
most
recently
in
clements
v.
fashion,
this
court
said
there
is
no
right
of
candidacy,
and
surely
not
a
right
to
have
your
name
placed
on
the
general
election
ballot.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
then
it
is
a
slight
reduction.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
yes,
justice
stevens,
but
i
think
what
we
are
looking
for
in
the
historical
material
is...
we
are
analyzing
for
the
rights
of
the
voters
so
we
are--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--i
am
sorry.
0
[generallaughter.]
thank
you
again
for
the
correction.
justice
white,
what
we
are
seeking
here,
though,
is
an
index
to
the
health
of
the
political
system,
aren't
we?
we
look
at
the
historical
information
to
see
whether
washington's
system
allows
major
parties
to
monopolize
the
debate,
or
do
we
have
a
healthy
system
which
allows
and
even
encourages
dissent.
put
another
way,
again,
do
the
major
parties
monopolize
debate
in
washington?
the
answer
is
clear
from
the
record.
the
wide-ranging
debate
is
alive
and
well
in
washington.
in
1984
the--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--and
we
think
that
is
very
important.
washington
thinks
that
is
very
important,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
protects
it,
first
through
allowing
the
party
nearly
automatic
access
to
the
primary,
and
secondly,
the
figures
will
show
that
even
this
party
has
consistently
placed
candidates.
it
is
true
that
they
have
not
been
successful
in
attracting
votes
in
the
statewide
races.
in
the
'84
election
their
governor
candidate
did
not
qualify,
but
their
candidate
for
u.s.
representative
did
qualify.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
i
think
they
have
conceded
in
their
brief
this
party
has
its
major...
if
there
is
a
base
of
adherence,
is
in
seattle-takoma
metropolitan
area.
i
am
sorry
about
the
name
error.
to
answer
you
first
question,
why
they
don't
qualify,
i
think
there
are
three
reasons.
the
court
has
said
we
are
entitled,
the
state
is,
to
ask
for
reasonably
diligent
candidates.
two,
they
may
have
a
message
the
voters
just
do
not
like.
or,
three,
they
may
have
unattractive
candidates,
and
on
this
record
we
don't
know
exactly
why
mr.
peoples
didn't
qualify,
but
the
record
does
show
they
expended
$1,900
on
a
statewide
senate
race
in
the
state
of
washington,
an
insignificant
amount,
and
if
it
reflects
the
support
that
they
could
draw,
a
financial
support,
the
effort,
i
say,
was
insignificant.
as
you
have
noted,
their
support
is
concededly
in
the
seattle-takoma
area,
where
all
that
effort
was
expended,
instead
of
broadening
their
base
to
the
whole
of
the
state.
finally,
the
record
also
shows
the
affidavit
at
c13
was
their
affidavit
setting
forth
all
the
electoral
efforts.
four
out
of
five
news
releases
they
put
out,
four
out
of
five
were
about
this
case.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
primarily
what
this
state,
this
court
has
conceded
the
state's
interest
in
requiring
a
showing
of
substantial
support
before
a
candidate
appears
on
the
ballot.
however,
justice
o'connor,
we
allow
the
candidate
on
the
ballot
the
first
time,
the
primary,
without
such
a
requirement.
in
that
regard
i
believe
the
washington
system
treats
them
better,
them
being
minor
parties,
better
than
most
systems.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
and
that
purpose
serves
two--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--that
purpose
serves
two
interests.
first,
avoiding
the
unduly
lengthy
laundry
list
ballot
that
this
court
has
referred
to
with
the
possible
effect
of
confusing
voters
and
allowing
frivolous
candidates--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--it
was
a
persuasive
argument
to
the
washington
legislature,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
think
they
have
a
right
under
this
court's
decision
to
respond
to
that.
secondly,
as
i
have
discussed
with
justice
marshall,
in
some
regard
placing
candidates
that
history
shows
have
never
attracted
substantial
support,
works
to
be
subsidizing
hopeless
candidates,
nor
is
the
state
or
the
government
obligated
to
subsidize
these
hopeless
candidates.
we
can
require
them
to
exercise
some
reasonable
diligence
and
expend
some
effort.
ultimately,
then,
to
the
extent
that
a
few
of
these
candidates
do
not
remain
on
the
ballot,
and
as
we
note
in
our
reply
brief,
the
summary
numbers
are
that
of
48
candidates,
independent
and
minor
party,
since
the
'76
election,
since
the
'76
changes,
i
believe
the
number
was
37
of
them
have
remained
on
the
general
election
ballot,
and
again,
they
are
already
on
the
ballot
in
the
primary
and
thus
afforded
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
political
debate
through
that
part,
and
most
of
them,
albeit
usually
for
the
u.s.
representative
and
local
races,
including
washington
state
legislative,
most
of
those
candidates
have
remained
on
the
ballot.
the
voters
determine
who
stays
on
the
ballot,
and
that
is
an
important
part
of
the
democratic
system.
the
constitutional
objective
or
test
was
differently
stated
by
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
this
court
in
your
1983
anderson
v.
celebrezze
case,
the
majority
saying
the
primary
values
protected
by
the
first
amendment
here
are
a
commitment
to
debate
on
public
issues,
uninhibited,
robust,
and
wide
open,
not
monopolized
by
the
existing
political
parties.
the
dissent
differently
stated
that
a
court's
job
is
to
ensure
that
the
state
in
no
way
freezes
the
status
quo
but
implicitly
recognizes
the
potential
fluidity
of
american
political
life.
under
either
formulation
of
the
constitutional
issues
here,
the
washington
statute
and
washington
election
system
meets
the
test
and
protects
the
constitutional
rights
of
its
voters.
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
just
a
moment,
please,
to
correct
an
answer
i
gave
justice
stevens,
that
consideration
of
the
number
of
candidates
printed
in
the
voters'
pamphlet
was
discussed
in
the
washington
legislature,
justice
stevens,
and
is
reprinted
at
page
a2
of
our
reply
brief,
the
note
that
this
effect
retroactively
analyzed
would
have
been
to
cut
down
the
number
of
candidates
from
65
to
50
in
that
printing.
the
argument
here
appears
to
want
to
escalate
the
washington
convent
ion
requirement
to
another
"barrier"--
mr.
james
m.
johnson
--no,
they
are
not,
as
i
responded
to
the
first
question.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
there
is
a
different
pamphlet
by
each
congressional
district.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
m.
johnson
in
fact,
the
convention
requirement
in
washington
is
the
equivalent
of
a
petition.
first,
the
convention
requirement
was
not
challenged
below
at
all,
as
you
can
see
from
the
complaint.
secondly,
the
district
court
found
that
this
party's
convention
was
a
"street
corner
convention".
the
attachments
to
c13,
an
affidavit
of
the
party,
show
the
candidates
standing
on
a
street
corner
in
seattle
conducting
their
convention,
and
the
point
is,
that
is
all
right
with
washington.
we
do
not
have
any
separate
barrier
through
convention
at
the
de
minimis
200
voter
requirement.
finally,
i
think
we
should
consider
the
alternatives
that
are
clearly
and
constitutionally
available
to
washington.
the
jenness
versus
5
percent
requirement
would
work
an
obligation
to
get
122,000
signatures
to
qualify
for
the
washington
ballot
as
contrasted
with
the
9,000
for
a
governor'
race
in
washington
and
a
sliding
scale
actually
which
we
impose.
the
1
percent
is
applied
to
each
office,
working
your
way
down
the
ballot,
and
is
much
less,
of
course,
for
local
offices,
and
this
is
why
washington
legislative
positions
and
local
offices,
the
minor
parties
have
always
been
successful
in
qualifying
for
the
general
election.
one
percent
is
not
a
large
requirement
to
dictate
substantial
support.
any
other
kind
of
method,
mr.
smith
suggests
we
use
a
scalpel,
but
any
content
control
requirement
to
discern
frivolous
parties
would,
i
submit,
be
unconstitutional,
so
a
numerical
requirement
is
required
constitutionally,
the
1
percent
imposed
by
the
washington
statute
is
reasonable
and
easily
reached
by
a
diligent
party.
therefore
we
conclude
the
washington
statute
is
constitutional
and
ought
to
be
upheld.
