could
you
tell
me
why
it
is
that
in
running
in
this
primary
the
independent
and
small
party
candidates
are
not
really
running
in
the
primary?
the
system
is
set
up
so
that
they
have
to
be
nominated
by
some
sort
of
a
convention
system
previously.
and
that
is
one
of
the
complaints
here,
that
it
is
a
primary
that...
for
them
it's
a
primary
that
really
isn't
a
primary.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
still
curious
as
to
the
reason
for
it.
is
that...
was
that
the
reason,
to
prevent
party
cross-overs
from
destroying
small
and
independent
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
any
guess
as
to
what
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
understand
that
one
of
the
arguments
being
made
here
is
that
since
there
are
not
two
candidates
competing,
why
would
you
expect
voters
to
come
out
to
vote
for
their--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
what
it
now
takes
is
200
people
in
a
convention.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
for
a
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you
want
to
run
without
party
support?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
is
that
relevant?
i
mean,
all
that
it
would
prove...
it
would
prove
either,
either
that
the
new
law
is
excessively
restrictive
or
that
the
old
law
was
excessively
latitudinarian.
it
could
prove
either
one.
it
depends
entirely
on
whether
there
were
too
many
parties
before,
whether
the
parties
beforehand
did
not
have
a
significant
amount
of
popular
support,
significant
enough
under
our
laws
to
justify
putting
them
on
the
ballot.
now,
how
do
we
know
that
the
preexisting
situation
was
a
good
situation?
i
tend
to
think
that
the
owl
party
is
not
something
that
we
needed
on
the
ballot
in
washington.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
your
brief
has
a
good
deal
of
that
in
it.
if
that
is
really
the
criterion,
then
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
earlier
should
have
been
different.
then
there
really
would
be
no
reason
to
exclude
anybody
from
the
ballot.
if
socrates
is
running
alone,
without
any
support
whatever,
he
should
be
on
the
ballot.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
he
has
no
support
whatever.
it
is
just,
he
is
a
wise
man,
he
can
contribute
to
the
discussion.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
many
expressions
in
our
cases
that
in
fact
the
state
can
require
that
the
people
it
puts
on
its
ballots
have
substantial
support?
not
that
they
be
wise.
not
that
they
have
good
ideas
to
contribute.
but
they
have
substantial
support.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
can't
be
the
explanation
of
our
cases
because
a
much
more...
much
less
restrictive
means
of
preventing
confusion
is
to
have
a
sliding
scale
of
the
degree
of
support
you
need.
that
is,
there
will
be
15
slots
on
the
ballot.
we
will
let
every
party
get
on
the
ballot
up
to
15.
past
15
it
is
confusing,
but
up
to
15
it
is
not
confusing.
so
i
don't
care
if
you
get
30
votes.
we
will
still
put
you
on
so
long
as
there
is
a
15th
slot
available.
now,
we
have
never
required
anything
like
that,
so
there
must
be
something
underlying
this
beyond
merely
confusing
the
voters.
we
do
require
substantial
support.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
note
you
have
slipped
in
the
word
"serious",
"serious
minor
party".
what
do
you
mean
by
serious?
when
you
say
serious,
i
immediately
think
substantial
popular
support.
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
serious?
they
are
socratic?
they
are
wise
people?
or
they
have
substantial
support?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
1
percent
of
a
smaller
number
is
a
smaller
number.
i
mean,
that
doesn't
prove
anything.
