justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
jr.
let's
assume
that
your
client
had
applied
to
this
particular
employer
for
a
job.
could
the
employer
have
declined
to
give
her
employment,
assuming
she
was
qualified
in
every
respect
except
to
work
friday
evenings
and
saturday?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
employing
one
person
who
couldn't
work
perhaps
would
create
no
hardship,
but
when
the
second
and
third
seventh
day
adventists
sought
employment
with
a
small
jewelry
company
i
suppose
the
hardship
would
be
evident.
justice
jr.
i
understand.
