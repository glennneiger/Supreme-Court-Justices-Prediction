mr.
john
d.
maher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state
of
florida
disagrees
that
sherbert
and
thomas
are
controlling
in
this
case,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
difference
between
those
cases
and
this
case,
a
difference
which
would
mean
if
those
precedents
were
followed
here
it
would
be
an
expansion
of
the
principle
of
law
announced
in
those
cases.
to
briefly
describe
these
differences,
the
sherbert
case
dealt
with
a
slightly
different
kind
of
penalty.
under
the
unemployment
compensation
laws
there
are
ineligibility
penalties
which
a
person
must
meet
certain
standards,
and
in
this
case
her
standard
was
the
availability
for
work.
she
wasn't
available
for
work
because
of
her
religious
status
and
the
nature
of
the
job
market
where
she
had
traditionally
worked
made
her
unavailable
as
construed
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
hobbie,
on
the
other
hand,
was
found
disqualified.
this
penalty
would
be
removed
after
she
becomes
reemployed
and
earns
a
certain
amount
of
money.
the
next
time
she
filed
a
claim
for
benefits
unless
she
became
unemployed
under
similar
circumstances
she
would
be
qualified.
it
is
not
a
status
situation
like...
in
sherbert's
case
every
time
she
filed
her
claim,
as
long
as
she
held
that
religion
and
lived
in
that
community
she
would
have
been
ineligible.
the
distinction
between
the
thomas
case
and
the
hobbie
case
was
described
as
the
agent
of
change.
it
was...
thomas's
employer
changed
the
conditions
of
his
employment,
causing
a
conflict
with
his
religious
beliefs.
no
such
change
was
done
by
lawton
and
company
in
hobbie's
case.
hobbie
changed
her
religion,
and
then
expected
her
employer
to
change
its
employment
practices
to
accommodate
her
religion.
those--
mr.
john
d.
maher
--justice
o'connor,
hobbie
would
have
been
awarded...
i'm
sorry.
thomas
would
have
been
awarded
benefits
had
he
applied
in
florida,
because
florida
recognizes
that
a
worker
can
have
good
cause
for
quitting
provided
it
is
attributable
to
the
employer,
and
in
this
case
it
was
attributable
to
the
employer.
i
don't
really
understand
why.
i
believe
it
was
the
state...
wisconsin,
i
believe,
did
not
pay
benefits
under
their
law
because
they
have
a
very
similar
provision,
but
we
would
say
that
the
employer
gave
thomas
good
cause
for
quitting
had
that
claim
arisen
in
florida.
mr.
john
d.
maher
i
believe
it
does,
because
as
hobbie
conceded,
it
would
be
unfair
for
a
person
to
accept
employment
that
is
in
conflict
with
their
religious
beliefs
and
then
expect
the
employer
to
make
adjustments.
i
would
submit
that
once
a
person
adopts
a
new
religion,
then
they
have
to
accept
whatever
consequences
exist
in
society--
mr.
john
d.
maher
--it
is
not
so
much
a
burden
as
i
would
see
it
as
it
is
just
the
recognition
of
the
realities
that
in
our
society
there
are
going
to
be
certain,
if
not
conflicts,
then
certain
impacts
between
religious
beliefs
or
free
exercise
of
religious
beliefs
and
society,
and
the
only
way
that
we
could
accommodate
these
changes
in
religion
would
be
to
make
special
accommodation.
now,
it
has
been
submitted
that
those
accommodations
may
be
made
by
the
states
to
religions
but
we
would
submit
that
it
is
not
required
that
they
be
made.
and
that
is
what
hobbie
seeks
in
this
case,
is
to
force
the
state
of
florida
into
paying
benefits
and
thereby
subsidizing
economically
her
change
in
religion
or
her
free
exercise
of
religious
beliefs.
mr.
john
d.
maher
it
is
a
more
coercive
penalty
in
sherbert's
case
than
it
would
be
in
this
case
because
it
would
continue
with
her
so
long
as
she
maintained
those
religious
beliefs,
whereas
in
this
case
unless
hobbie
takes
employment
in
conflict
with
her
religion
there
won't
be
a
future
disqualification.
the
choice
will
be
hers.
mr.
john
d.
maher
to
an
extent,
justice
stevens.
the
unemployment
compensation
laws
are
somewhat
a
cross
between
an
insurance
statute
and
a
tax
code,
and
they've
got
numerous
little
nuances
to
them
that
sometimes
have
to
be
explained
in
detail.
to
answer
your
question,
she
would
not...
a
person
who
becomes
disabled
and
can't
work
would
not
be
disqualified
under
the
misconduct
provision,
okay,
obviously,
because
there
wouldn't
be
an
intentional
act.
your
premise
there
was
very
accurate.
however,
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
another
provision
of
the
statute
that
says
a
person
who
leaves
employment
for
disability
is
not
subject
to
disqualification
for
quitting
either.
the
problem
with
that
is,
the
statute
requires
an
individual
to
be
able
and
available
to
work
in
order
to
collect
benefits,
so
unless
the
person
recovered--
mr.
john
d.
maher
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
maher
right.
because
there
is
a--
mr.
john
d.
maher
--that's
correct,
because
there
is
a
specific
provision
covering
disability,
illness
or
disability.
there
is
no
similar
provision,
hobbie
is
trying
to
add
one--
mr.
john
d.
maher
--i
would
style
it
just
the
opposite
of
that.
it
is
that
we
haven't
carved
out
one
for
religion.
there
is
one
for
illness
but
there
isn't
one
for
religion.
there
isn't
one
for
all
the
other
personal
reasons
that
might
cause
a
person
to
commit
misconduct
or
to
quit
their
job.
hobbie
wants
us
to
carve
out
a
special
exception.
mr.
john
d.
maher
right.
well,
let
me
address
that--
mr.
john
d.
maher
--let
me...
for
different
reasons.
let
me
address
that
misconduct
question
because
it
was
discussed
earlier.
we
are
not
talking
about
misconduct
in
the
moral
sense
that
she
did
anything
that
was
bad.
we
are
talking
about
it
in
the
employment
relationship,
something
that
was
inconsistent
with
her
employment,
an
intentional
disregard
of
her
employment,
not
something
that
you
could
say
that
she
should
be
faulted
for
morally.
mr.
john
d.
maher
well,
obviously,
an
illness
is
completely
unintentional.
depending
on
your
religious
beliefs,
you
could
believe
that
religion
is
or
is
not.
i
think
that
gets
into
a
very
philosophical
discussion,
but
i
would
have
to
assume
that
hobbie's
conversion
was
something
that
she
did
wilfully,
and
that
she
would
have
certain
consequences
that
she
should
be
expected
to...
that
she
would
be
expected
to
deal
with
as
a
result
of
that
conversion,
and
it
would
be
just
like
someone
walking
in
off
the
street
carrying
religious
beliefs
and
taking
work
that
knew
that
they
had
requirements
that
would
conflict
but
expecting
the
employer
to
make
adjustments
to
it.
we
see
it
as
no
different.
mr.
john
d.
maher
we
had
this
case
yesterday.
mr.
john
d.
maher
if
she
is--
mr.
john
d.
maher
--yes,
i
was.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
john
d.
maher
i
was.
she...
once
she
becomes
disabled,
not
just
by
virtue
of
pregnancy,
but
when
she
can
no
longer
work,
then
the
disability
provision
would
apply.
mr.
john
d.
maher
and
she
would
not
be
guilty
of
misconduct.
otherwise
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
hold
otherwise.
the
position
that
we
have
taken
is
to
definitely
not
expand
the
sherbert
and
thomas
rationale
because
it
works
an
inequity,
if
you
will,
on
the
states
in
that
it
requires
them
to
do
more
than
should
be
required.
for
example,
the
state
of
florida
is
not
required
to
have
an
unemployment
compensation
program.
it
adopted
that
program
voluntarily
with
some
financial
incentives
from
the
federal
government.
and
we
would
submit
that
states
should
only
be
required
to
administer
that
program
in
a
neutral,
evenhanded
fashion
with
respect
to
the
religion
clauses.
we
should
not
be...
and
we
cannot
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
religion
but
then
again
we
should
not
be
forced
to
discriminate
on
behalf
of
religion
to
promote
religion,
and
recent
decisions
of
this
court
suggest
there
is
some
sympathy
for
the
position
taken
by
the
state
of
florida.
the
cases
dealing
with
abortion,
for
example,
wherein
this
court
says
that
an
individual
has
a
constitutional
right
to
seek
an
abortion,
that
a
state
cannot
prohibit
that,
but
the
united
states
nor
the
states
are
compelled
to
provide
pay
for
the
abortion,
at
least
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
john
d.
maher
they
are
so
close
that
i
would
say
that
you
have
to
draw
a
very
fine
definition.
mr.
john
d.
maher
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
last
part.
mr.
john
d.
maher
probably
so.
one
example
that
does
involve
the
religion
clause,
the
parochial
schools,
the
courts
held
that
we
cannot
abolish
or
interfere
with
the
operation
of
parochial
schools,
but
then
again
we
are
not
allowed
to
provide
incentives
to
promote
parochial
schools,
and
that
cases
like
meek
v.
pettinger
and
woolman
v.
walter
have
tried
to
basically
keep
the
government
away
from
religious
schools
and
religion
away
from
public
schools.
probably
the
best
example
of
a
parallel
between
the
situation
here
and
a
case
decided
by
this
court
was
that
of
johnson
v.
robison
or
robeson
in
which
a
veterans,
while
he
wasn't
a
veteran,
he
was
a
conscientious
objector
who
did
not
serve
during
the
war,
applied
for
veterans
administration
benefits,
which
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
had
he
participated
in
the
war,
and
the
courts...
the
court
held
that
such
benefits
were
inappropriate,
that
the
government
could
provide
benefits
only
to
certain
persons
who
met
certain
requirements,
and
that
the
religion,
even
though
he
did
this
solely
based
upon
his
religious
convictions,
he
could
not
use
that
to
force
the
veterans
administration
to
pay
benefits.
similarly
in
the
bob
jones
university
case
where
a
tax
exemption
was
denied
on
the
basis
of
racial
discrimination,
the
court
denied
awarding
that
exemption
solely
because
this
was
a
religious
institution.
finally,
perhaps
the
most
well-known
example
of
this
court's
refusal
to
deny
a
government
the
opportunity
to
uniformly
apply
a
law
was
the
sunday
closing
cases
of
brunfield
v.
brown
and
mcgowan
v.
maryland,
also,
we
would
submit,
the
united
states
v.
lee
on
social
security
benefits.
all
of
these
cases
indicate
that
the
government
can
do
certain
things
which
have
impact
on
religion
and
not
have
to
carve
out
a
specific
exception.
mr.
john
d.
maher
wisconsin
v.
yoder?
mr.
john
d.
maher
wisconsin
v.
yoder
i
think
is
the
example
of
where
the
line
should
be
drawn,
where
there
is
a
very
strong
coercive
impact
between
the
government
regulation
and
the
religious
practices.
yoder
would
have
required
these
school
children
to
attend
school
daily,
in
conflict
with
their
religious
teaching,
a
very
coercive
thing
to
go
through.
the
alternative
to
that
was
to
commit
a
crime
under
the
local
ordinance.
the
impact
here
is
not
nearly
related
to
that...
nearly
that
strong.
this
statute
does
not
regulate
working
on
sundays
or
saturdays.
it
doesn't
regulate...
such
as
estate
of
thurston
v.
caldwell.
it
doesn't
regulate
directly
like
that.
it
is
just
a
uniform
unemployment
compensation
law
that
does
not
carve
out
an
exception
for
people
like
hobbie.
and
florida
has
taken
the
position
that
it
doesn't
need
to,
that
it
shouldn't
be
required
to.
the
question
here
that
was
asked
earlier
about
would
we
apply
this
to
other
secular
situations,
i
submit
that
if
a
person
refused
on
work
on
saturday,
not
one
saturday
but
all
saturdays,
it
would
be
held
to
be
misconduct.
the
cases
that
were
cited
suggesting
remand
were
those
dealing
with
one-time
situations
that
were
related
to
personal
reasons.
in
langley
a
cook
didn't
comply
with
the
chef's
instructions
because
his
father
had
had
a
heart
attack,
one
occasion.
the
commission
had
held,
and
affirmed
by
the
courts,
that
this
was
not
misconduct.
but
this
was
not
to
say
he
was
going
to
refuse
to
work
all
future
saturdays
or
whatever,
just
one
occasion.
in
parker,
the
man
was
incarcerated
but
not
convicted
of
anything,
and
that
is
what
the
state
court
held,
that
there
was
no
showing
that
he
did
anything
wrong,
so
no
culpability.
and
in
hartenstein,
the
third
case
that
was
cited,
the
man
merely
requested
time
off
to
attend
a
funeral.
i
mean,
these
were
all
very
short-lived.
to
show
other
secular
examples
of
state
court
opinions,
in
slusher
v.
state,
354
southern
2nd
450,
the
state
of
florida
held
that
a
woman
whose
husband's
job
is
transferred
out
of
state
and
who
quits
to
relocate
with
him
is
disqualified.
that
is
obviously
a
compelling
personal
reason
who
would
be
disqualified
under
florida
law.
another
case,
beard,
which
is
cited
in
the
state's
brief
on
the
merits,
a
woman
who
quit
employment
because
of
a
shift
change,
which
she
initially
agreed
to,
conflicted
with
her
ability
to
care
for
two
teenage
dependents
held
disqualified.
and
in
city
of
riviera
beach
v.
department
of
commerce,
372
southern
2nd
1000,
a
woman
who
took
time
off
from
work
without
permission
to
spend
more
time
adjusting
to
her
newly
adopted
child
was
held
disqualified.
so
we
are
not
singling
out
religion
here.
these
are
all
personal
reasons
of
a
compelling
nature
that
florida
has
decided,
unlike
some
states,
to
exclude,
not
exclude,
but
fail
to
include
personal
reasons
as
good
cause
for
either
quitting
or
conflict
with
employment.
now,
the
probably
most
recent
examples
of
the
courts
looking
at
this
issue
came
up
in
the
bowen
v.
roy,
dealing
with
the
social
security
program,
in
which
an
indian
objected
to
having
their
infant
daughter
assigned
and
ultimately
the
use
of
a
number,
social
security
number,
and
this
court
refused
to
force
the
administration
to
make
special
accommodations
to
changes
in
its
procedures
in
order
to
make
an
exception
for
little
bird
in
the
snow.
a
similar
refusal
to
make
an
exception
occurred
in
goldman
v.
weinberger,
in
which
an
air
force
captain
wished
to
have
the
air
force
give
an
exception
that
would
permit
him
to
wear
a
yarmulke
while
on
duty
in
unfair,
and
this
court
refused
to
compel
the
air
force
to
make
an
exception
in
his
case.
and
that
is
what
this
case
boils
down
to,
is
whether
hobbie
is
entitled
to
an
exception
that
would
force
the
state
of
florida
to
change
its
unemployment
compensation
program
to
basically
accommodate
her
religion.
the
state
submits
that
that
does
not
in
some
of
the
more
recent
opinions
of
the
court
constitute
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
but
it
certainly
closes
the
distance
leading
to
a
collision
between
those
clauses.
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
and
carving
out
statutory
exceptions
to
accommodate
religion
are
getting
very
close,
and
we
would
submit
that
if
court
were
to
expand
sherbert
and
thomas
to
encompass
this
case,
then
it
would
be
moving
in
that
direction
of
a
collision
with
the
establishment
clause,
a
direction
which
we
do
not
feel
is
well
advised.
mr.
john
d.
maher
it
is
something
that
needs
to
be
resolved.
i
see
what
you
mean,
justice
scalia.
that
is
true.
but
if
that
is
the
case,
then
the
need
is
for
the
collision
to
be
resolved
somehow,
and
i
submit
it
wasn't
done
in
sherbert,
and
that
was
a
criticism
in
one
of
the
concurring
or
dissenting
opinions,
that...
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
and
i
think
it
is
going
to
become
a
reconstruction
or
a
retreat
of
the
establishment
clause,
if
that
is
to
be
the
case,
which
it
may
be.
thank
you.
