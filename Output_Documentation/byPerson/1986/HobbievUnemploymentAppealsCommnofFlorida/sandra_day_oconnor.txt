justice
o'connor
mr.
carson,
the
solicitor
general
also
suggested,
as
i
recall,
that
regardless
of
the
test
the
court
ends
up
applying,
that
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
develop
the
facts
on
the
effect
and
operation
of
florida's
statute
here,
that
we
shouldn't
decide
it
alone
on
the
ground
that
mrs.
hobbie
was
denied
benefits.
would
you
care
to
comment
on
that
suggestion?
justice
o'connor
do
you
find
any
tension
at
all
between
the
thomas
case
and
estate
of
thornton
which
the
court
decided
more
recently?
justice
o'connor
in
estate
of
thornton,
of
course,
the
court
found
that
a
state
law
providing
sabbath
worshippers
an
absolute
right
not
to
work
on
the
sabbath
violated
the
establishment
clause,
so
it
is
rather
ironic
that
the
very
same
provision
if
compelled
by
the
state
is
unconstitutional,
and
yet
to
deny
the
benefits--
justice
o'connor
--would
also
be
unconstitutional
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
i
am
not
entirely
sure,
mr.
maher,
that
i
see
what
difference
that
should
make
insofar
as
unemployment
compensation
benefits
is
concerned.
justice
o'connor
does
it
really
make
any
difference
under
the
constitutional
standards,
do
you
think,
that
this
particular
woman,
mrs.
hobbie,
was
a
recent
convert
instead
of
holding
her
beliefs
over
a
longer
period
of
time?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
seems
to
allow
the
state
to
put
a
special
burden
on
religious
conversion,
and
it
just
struck
me
as
a
very
strange
argument.
