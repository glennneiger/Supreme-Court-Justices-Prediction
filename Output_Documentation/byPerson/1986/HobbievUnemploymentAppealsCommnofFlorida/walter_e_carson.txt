mr.
walter
e.
carson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
not
a
factually
complex
case.
however,
it
is
a
case
that
will
have
profound
effects
on
the
free
exercise
rights
of
all
americans.
the
issues
to
be
addressed
by
the
appellate
in
this
case
are
threefold.
first,
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
court's
decisions
in
sherbert,
374
us,
and
thomas,
450
us,
and
is
factually
indistinguishable
from
those
cases.
secondly,
the
basis
that
unemployment
compensation
was
denied
to
paula
hobbie,
that
basis
being
misconduct,
creates
a
vehicle,
a
mechanism,
if
you
will,
whereby
the
state
of
florida
can
discriminate
against
individuals
because
of
their
religious
beliefs.
and
finally,
both
the
free
exercise
clause
and
the
establishment
clause
ask
that
the
courts
and
the
laws
of
this
land
accommodate
a
person's
religious
practices
and
beliefs.
moving
to
the
first
phase
of
our
argument,
your
honor,
the
case,
as
we
indicated,
is
factually
and
legally
indistinguishable
from
the
court's
decisions
in
sherbert
and
thomas,
and
i
would
like
to
lay
before
the
court
briefly
the
facts
of
those
cases
so
that
the
court
can
appreciate
the
similarities.
paula
hobbie
had
worked
for
lawton
jewelers
for
approximately
two
and
one-half
years.
at
that
time
she
was
converted
to
the
teachings
of
the
seventh
day
adventist
church.
as
such
she
was
convicted
that
the
sabbath,
that
period
from
sundown
friday
to
sundown
saturday,
was
a
holy
day
and
was
a
special
day.
she
reached
these
convictions
and
they
were
sincerely
held.
she
brought
this
information
to
the
attention
of
her
employer
and
her
immediate
supervisor
and
she
worked
out
an
accommodation,
an
arrangement
whereby
she
worked
for
him
on
sundays
and
in
turn
he
worked
for
her
on
friday
evenings
and
during
the
sabbath
hours
on
saturday.
this
arrangement
worked
out.
it
was,
at
least
according
to
the
immediate
supervisor,
an
acceptable
arrangement.
when
upper
management
learned
of
this
accommodation
they
put
a
stop
to
it
immediately,
gave
paula
hobbie
the
choice
of
her
job
or
her
religious
beliefs.
she
refused
to
give
up
her
religious
beliefs.
she
refused
to
resign.
and
she
in
fact
was
fired
by
the
employer.
she
applied
for
unemployment
compensation.
the
employer
objected,
the
state
agreed,
and
she
was
denied
unemployment
compensation
for
misconduct
associated
with
her
work.
she
took
an
appeal
to
the
fifth
district
appellate
court
in
florida.
the
court
there
affirmed
the
florida
unemployment
appeals
commission
decision
denying
her
unemployment
compensation,
and
she
has
brought
the
case
here
today.
there
are
a
number
of
factual
and
legal
parallels
between
hobbie
and
this
court's
decisions
in
sherbert
and
thomas.
hobbie,
like
sherbert
and
thomas,
was
denied
unemployment
compensation
by
the
state.
hobbie,
like
sherbert
and
thomas,
was
asked
or
forced
to
choose
between
her
religion
and/or
her
work.
hobbie,
like
sherbert
and
thomas,
was
put
into
a
situation
where
work
once
acceptable
for
religious
reasons
became
objectionable,
and
because
of
those
changed
conditions
she
was
no
longer
able
to
work
during
that
period.
and
in
hobbie
just
as
in
sherbert
and
thomas
the
state
once
again
has
brought
pressure
to
bear
on
her
to
modify
her
religious
beliefs.
the
holding
in
sherbert
and
thomas
reached
an
important,
we
believe,
milestone
in
free
exercise
jurisprudence.
the
compelling
state
interest
standard
was
applied
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
and
we
believe
that
that
same
standard
applies
here
in
this
case,
that
the
state
of
florida
cannot
burden
paula
hobbie's
religious
beliefs
unless
it
is
able
to
show
that
a
compelling
state
interest
exists
and
justifies
such
a
burden.
there
is
one
unique
aspect
in
the
hobbie
case
that
was
not
before
the
court
in
sherbert
or
in
thomas,
and
of
course
that
is
the
defense
that
was
raised
by
the
state,
the
agent
of
change.
the
agent
of
change
theory
suggests
that
because
paula
hobbie
converted
and
adopted
her
religious
practices
after
she
began
her
employment,
that
that
act
of
conversion,
that
act
which
is
so
fundamental
to
a
free
exercise
right,
distinguishes
her
situation
from
sherbert
and
from
thomas
and
thus
disqualifies
her
from
entitlements
to
the
benefits
under
the
state's
unemployment
compensation
program.
we
would
suggest
that
such
a
distinction
is
not
a
valid
one
and
that
the
principles
in
sherbert
and
thomas
should
control.
to
allow
the
agent
of
change
to
become
a
defense
would
in
effect
deny
a
person
at
any
time
from
converting
to
new
religious
beliefs
and
practices,
and
of
course
that
right
of
conversion,
that
right
to
adopt
a
new
religion,
is
fundamental
and
central
to
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
your
honor,
it
would
be
my
impression
that
she
would
be
entitled
to
benefits
for
a
physical
disability,
and
it
is
ironic
that
the
state
would
award
benefits
to
a
person
for
a
physical
disability
but
not
for
a
religious
disability,
if
you
will.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
there
is
one
state
supreme
court
decision,
key
state
bank
versus
adams,
where
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
agent
of
change.
i
would
merely
suggest
that
the
court
might
find
it
of
interest
that
court
rejected
the
agent
of
change
argument.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
are
cases
that
would
suggest
that
individuals
for
personal
reasons
have
been
denied...
or
have
been
granted
unemployment
compensation
whereas
paula
hobbie,
because
of
her
religious
reasons,
was
denied
unemployment
compensation,
and
there
are
three
cases
that
appeared
in
footnote
14
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
in
those
three
cases,
again,
it
was
the
misconduct
standard
that
was
before
the
courts
in
those
three
cases.
the
cases
found
that
an
individual,
for
example,
who
was
absent
from
work
because
he
was
in
jail
did
not...
that
that
absence
did
not
constitute
misconduct,
and
that
that
person
was
entitled
to
unemployment
compensation;
another
individual
who
was
absent
to
attend
a
funeral,
that
that
kind
of
absence
did
not
constitute
misconduct.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
in
terms
of
the
sherbert
and
thomas
standard,
we
believe
that
that
should
be
applied
and
should
be
controlling
in
this
case,
and
that
the
agent
of
change
defense
is
not
a
valid
one.
rather,
the
focus
should
be
on
the
conduct
of
the
state
and
here
the
state
denied
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
paula
hobbie.
if
paula
hobbie
loses
her
appeal
to
this
court
we
think
that
the
effects
would
be
far-reaching
and
perhaps
even
devastating
in
terms
of
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
obviously,
if
this
case
is
reversed
it
would
have
the
effect
of
reversing
sherbert
and
thomas,
putting
into
question
this
court's
decision
in
yoder
versus
wisconsin
as
well.
it
will
generate,
we
believe,
a
generation
of
litigation
as
courts
across
the
country
try
to
work
out
and
sort
out
what
has
basically
been
25
years
of
established
law
in
this
area.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
would.
i
think
all
of
the
relevant
constitutional
facts
are
before
the
court
and
it
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
to
send
this
case
back
for
additional
hearings.
the
comparison
to
the
sherbert
and
thomas
cases
are
self-evident.
again,
the
state
denied
unemployment
compensation
to
an
individual
because
of
her
religious
beliefs.
she
was
put
to
that
choice
between
the
exercise
of
those
beliefs
and
the
benefits
that
were
available.
clearly,
we
think
nothing
more
can
be
generated
that
would
add
any
additional
light
or
assist
this
court
further
in
applying
that
compelling
state
interest
standard.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
i
think,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
walter
e.
carson
--i
don't
see
a
tension,
quite
frankly,
in
this
case.
calder,
of
course,
was
very
specific
in
its
legislative
provisions.
it
mandated
that
the
employer
had
to
accommodate
the
religious
practices
of
the
individual.
it
created
a
situation
where
there
might
be
hardship
on
other
employees
and
other
individuals
who
would
be
affected
by
that
mandatory
law.
this
is
not
that
type
of
a
mandatory
law.
it
is
not
an
individual
employer
who
is
being
affected.
rather,
it
is
a
state
benefits
program,
benefits
that
are
being
paid
to
all
citizens
in
the
state
of
florida.
there
is
none
of
this
injury
to
third
parties,
nor
is
there
in
any
sense
an
obligatory
obligation
placed
on
the
employer
that
the
employer
must
accommodate
the
religious
beliefs
and
practices
of
paula
hobbie.
basically,
paula
hobbie
is
asking
to
be
treated
like
all
other
individuals
in
the
state
of
florida.
as
i
indicated,
the
reversal
of
hobbie,
the
loss
of
hobbie's
case
before
this
court
would
unsettle
what
we
believe
to
be
established
law,
law
that
has
been
established
for
some
25
years,
and
if
this,
if
you
will,
more
relaxed
standard
that
has
been
suggested
to
the
court
were
adopted,
tragically,
we
would
be
confronted
with
a
situation
where
the
individual
always
loses
in
free
exercise
cases,
the
state
always
wins,
and
there
would
be
serious
questions
as
to
the
viability
of
the
free
exercise
clause
itself.
i
would
touch
next,
your
honors,
on
the
misconduct
standard
used
by
the
state
of
florida
to
deny
benefits
to
paula
hobbie.
i
would...
in
my
argument
i
would
suggest
that
the
misconduct
standard
is
not
unlike
the
good
cause
standard
that
members
of
the
court
have
found
persuasive
creating
a
situation
or
a
mechanism,
if
you
will,
for
individualized
exemptions
under
the
state
law.
misconduct,
of
course,
has
a
negative
sense
or
meaning
to
it,
and
as
i
have
mentioned
already
there
are
cases
that
were
cited
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
i
have
mentioned
to
the
court
that
would
suggest
that
misconduct
has
been
applied
against
paula
hobbie
in
terms
of
her
religious
beliefs
and
practices,
but
that
same
standard
has
been
rejected
by
the
courts
in
florida
in
a
situation
where
an
individual
was
in
jail
and
missed
work
and
yet
his
jail
absence
did
not
constitute
misconduct.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
i
think
the
thomas
decision,
your
honor,
was
a
natural
evolution,
if
you
will,
of
the
principles
that
were
first
articulated
in
sherbert
and
were
further
refined
and
developed
in
the
yoder
v.
wisconsin
case,
and
ultimately
found
their
fruition
in
thomas.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
your
honor,
i
would
look
to
sherbert
and
thomas
first
and
foremost
as
protecting
the
free
exercise
of
religion
under
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
an
issue
that
might
come
up
under
title
7--
mr.
walter
e.
carson
--of
the
civil
rights
law,
and
the
standard
that
the
legislature
has
established
there
that
an
employer
must
accommodate
a
person's
religious
beliefs
unless
to
do
so
would
create
an
undue
hardship
on
the
operation
of
that
particular
business,
and
so
to
answer
your
question,
the
employer
could
deny
her
a
job
if
her
religious
beliefs
and
limitations
would
create
an
undue
hardship
on
the
operation
of
his
business.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
that
could
create
a
hardship
but
those
are
not
the
facts
here.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
all
right,
sir.
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
raise
in
my
argument
is
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
the
lynch
case.
the
court
articulated
this
statement.
"the
first
amendment
affirmatively
mandates
accommodation,
not
merely
tolerance,
of
all
religions
and
forbids
hostility
towards
any.
"
and
of
course
that
was
an
extension
of
the
position
that
the
court
had
taken
in
zorach
v.
clauson.
the
court
has
often
spoken
of
america,
of
our
people
being
a
religious
people,
where
god
has
a
role
and
plays
an
important
factor
in
the
lives
of
many
americans.
we
believe
that
the
free
exercise
clause
mandates
this
accommodation,
mandates,
if
you
will,
that
wherever
possible
a
person's
religious
beliefs
and
practices
be
accommodated,
and
such
an
accommodation
is
not
inconsistent,
we
believe,
with
either
the
free
exercise
clause
or
the
establishment
clause,
that
those
two
clauses
when
read
together
amply
support
the
relief
that
paula
hobbie
is
seeking
before
this
court.
in
conclusion,
paula
hobbie
asks
from
this
court
only
that
the
promise
of
the
free
exercise
clause
be
kept.
her
request
is
not
only
for
herself
but
countless
others
who
also
treasure
religious
freedom
in
this
country.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
walter
e.
carson
your
honor,
i
believe
that
paula
hobbie
would
rest
on
the
submission.
thank
you.
