mr.
carson,
on
that
point
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
supposing
that
instead
of
being
converted
to
a
new
religion
she
had
acquired
some
physical
disability
that
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
continue
her
work.
would
she
then
have
received
unemployment
compensation
or
not
under
the
florida
scheme?
justice
stevens
are
there
florida
cases
that
make
that
clear,
because
i
couldn't
really
tell
from
the
briefs,
and
the
language
of
the
statute
seems
to
say
she
has
to
be
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
work.
but
you
think
it
is
clear
she
would
have
been
entitled
to
benefits
if
it
were
a
physical
disability.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
the
same
question
really
i
asked
your
opponent,
i
guess,
but
she
was,
in
this
case
she
was
found
guilty
of
misconduct
for
refusing
to
work,
and
as
i
understand
the
administrative
law
judge's
opinion
or
whatever
the
proper
title
is,
it
had
to
be
an
intentional
act
of
misconduct,
namely,
refusing
to
work.
that
suggested
to
me
that
if
she
had
had
a
physical
accident
of
some
kind
that
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
work,
that
would
not
constitute
misconduct
and
she
would
have
gotten
benefits.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
but
that,
being
able
to
work,
to
collect
benefits
applies
to
the
period
in
which
benefits
are
claimed
rather
than
the
time
of
the
discharge.
justice
stevens
so
it
would
be
conceivable
to
me...
now,
maybe
this
isn't
a
fair
thing
under
florida
law,
conceivable
to
me
that
she
would
meet
that
standard
because
she
would
be
able
to
work
at
a
lot
of
other
jobs
and
she
could
very
well
work
at
jobs
that
don't
require
them
to
be
there
on
saturday
and
therefore
not
violate
that
provision.
justice
stevens
and
if
that
is
true
then
it
seems
to
me
the
net
result
of
it
is
that
she
would
get
benefits
if
instead
of
having
this
burden,
this
obstacle
to
working,
namely
a
religious
obstacle,
if
she
had
a
physical
obstacle.
justice
stevens
so
then
isn't...
can
one
argue
that
this
is
a
special
burden
on
a
religious,
you
might
call
it
a
handicap
in
effect.
if
she
is
a
person
of
conscience,
she
simply
can't
work,
and
why
should
that
be
different
from
someone
with
a
broken
leg?
justice
stevens
but
it
is
only
a
special
exception
if
you
are
willing
to
say
that
it
is
misconduct
when
your
reason
for
not
being
able
to
work
is
a
religious
reason
as
opposed
to
a
physical
reason.
justice
stevens
both
people
are
simply
unable
to
work.
justice
stevens
but
is
it
really
any
more
intentional
if
there
is
this
religious
obstacle
than
the
consequence
of
a
physical
inability
to
work?
either
one
would
like
to
work,
presumably,
but
there
is
something
that
they
cannot
overcome.
why
is
one
intentional
and
the
other
not
intentional?
justice
stevens
what
about
a
woman
who
becomes
pregnant?
would
she
be
disqualified
in
the
same
way?
justice
stevens
say
she
deliberately
became
pregnant
and
so
forth,
and
therefore
couldn't
work
for
a
certain
period.
what
happens
to
her
in
florida?
