chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
85-993,
paula
a.
hobbie
versus
unemployment
appeals
commission
of
florida
and
lawton
and
company.
mr.
carson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
carson,
could
we
go
back
a
minute
to
justice
stevens'...
are
there
cases
in
florida
that
support
your
view
of
florida
law
on
that
point?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
deduce
from
that
type
of
case
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
case
about
someone
who
developed
a
handicap
in
the
course
of
employment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
carson,
do
you
think
our
decision
and
opinion
in
the
thomas
case
went
further
than
the
decision
and
opinion
in
the
sherbert
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
it
were
to
turn
out
upon
an
examination
of
florida
law
in
this
case
that
actually
florida
is
quite
strict
about
the
sort
of
thing
that
your
client
engaged
in,
and
for
anything
like
that
or
similar
to
it,
being
in
jail
or
something
for
nonreligious
reasons
very
strictly
dealt
with,
it
is
either
misconduct,
unavailable,
whatever,
do
you
think
sherbert
and
thomas
would
govern
that
situation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
under
my
hypothesis
do
you
think
the
result
there
is
foreordained
by
the
opinions
in
sherbert
and
thomas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carson.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
maher.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
maher.
mr.
carson,
do
you
have
something
more?
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opnions
