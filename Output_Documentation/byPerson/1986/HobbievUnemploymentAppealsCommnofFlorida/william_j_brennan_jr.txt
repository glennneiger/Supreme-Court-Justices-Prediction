justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
first
of
these
cases,
hobbie
versus
unemployment
commission,
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals.
appellant
hobbie
was
an
employee
of
appellee
lawton
and
company
a
florida
jeweler.
hobbie's
work
schedule
required
that
she
work
on
saturdays,
but
after
she
had
been
working
for
a
while
she
became
a
convert
to
the
seventh-day
adventist
church,
and
informed
her
employer
that
she
could
no
longer
work
on
saturdays,
the
sabbath
of
the
adventist
church.
appellee,
lawton
and
company,
there
upon
discharged
her.
hobbie
filed
a
claim
for
unemployment
compensation
with
the
florida
department
of
labor
and
employment
security.
the
claim
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
the
florida
statute
disqualified
her
for
benefits
because
under
that
statute,
her
discharge
was
for
misconduct
connected
with
her
work.
the
florida
fifth
district
court
of
appeals
summarily
affirmed
rejecting
hobbie's
contention
that
her
disqualification
of
unemployment
compensation,
violated
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
we
now
reverse.
we
hold
that
reversal
is
required
under
our
decisions
in
sherbert
v.
verner
decided
in
1963,
and
thomas
v.
review
board
decided
in
1984.
in
sherbert,
we
considered
south
carolina's
denial
of
unemployment
compensation
to
a
sabbatarian
of
the
adventist
faith,
like
hobbie
who
was
used
to
work
on
a
saturdays.
we
held
in
the
sherbert
that
the
denial
violated
sherbert's
constitutional
right
to
free
exercise
of
her
religion
because
of
forced
down
to
choose
between
following
a
precepts
of
her
religion,
and
forfeiting
benefits
and
the
one
hand
and
the
bundling
one
of
the
precepts
of
her
religion
in
order
to
accept
work
on
the
other.
governmental
imposition
of
such
a
choice
puts
the
same
kind
of
burden
upon
the
exercise
of
religion
as
would
a
fine
imposed
against
her
for
her
saturday
worship.
justice
powell
and
justice
stevens
have
filed
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
