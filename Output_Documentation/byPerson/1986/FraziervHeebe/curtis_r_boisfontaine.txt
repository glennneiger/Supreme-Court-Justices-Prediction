mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
may
i
quickly
answer
your
question,
justice
marshall?
the
louisiana
bar
is
an
integrated
bar;
has
been
for
some
35
years,
integrated
in
both
meanings
of
the
word.
you
must
belong
to
the
bar
association
in
order
to
practice.
you
must
belong...
you
must
be
admitted
to
practice
to
belong
to
the
bar
association.
and
it
has
no
color
lines
whatsoever.
before
going
into
detail
specifically,
there's
one...
there's
one
point
that
i
think
needs
repeating
if
not
clarification.
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
admits
any
licensed
lawyer
of
the
50
states
to
practice
before
it.
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
or
not
a
lawyer
may
practice
in
the
eastern
district.
the
issue
is,
under
what
method
may
he
practice
in
the
eastern
district?
take
the
unlicensed...
the
lawyer
that
is
not
licensed
in
louisiana.
take
the
lawyer
in
nome,
alaska.
he
may
come
to
the
eastern
district,
seek
and
obtain
admission
pro
hac
vice,
and
obtain
local
counsel
to
assist
him.
under
one
of
the
subparts
of
rule
21,
the...
the
necessity
for
local
counsel
may
be
waived,
and
the
evidence
in
the
record
says
that
that
is
done
from
time
to
time
upon
showing
of
need.
now
the
lawyer
who
is
licensed--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--the
rule
itself,
sir,
provides...
rule
21.6,
i
believe...
that
if
it
does
a
hardship
to
the
client,
or
if
substantial
compliance
with
the
rules
is
assured,
the
waiver
of
local
counsel
is
given.
and
our
evidence
in
the
record,
which
is
unrebutted,
is
to
the
effect
that
it
is
often
waived.
the
pro
hac
vice
is
one
method
of
practicing
in
that
court.
two
other
methods
exist.
if
you're
a
louisiana
lawyer
and
you
live
in
the
state,
you
may
practice
under
general
admission.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
yes,
sir.
even
if
you...
if
you
have
an
office
in
the
state
and
you
live
in
mr.
frazier's
city,
you
may
still
practice
generally
in
that
court.
if
you
live
in
new
orleans
and
have
your
office
in
pascagoula,
mississippi,
you
may
practice
generally
in
that
court.
so
that
there
are
options
on
general
admission,
and
if
you
don't,
fit
the
options,
then
you
have
liberally
granted
pro
hac
vice
admission.
we
have
no
evidence
of
record
where
a
lawyer
has
applied
and
has
been
turned
down
admission
to
practice
before
this
court.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
think
there
are
some
district
courts
that
allow
just
such
a
restriction.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
think
our
position
is--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--i
believe
congress
has
told
this
court
that
it
can
make
necessary
rules,
and
the
evidence
by
the
way
of
record,
says
these
rules
are
necessary,
to
make
sure
that
the
speedy
and
efficient
administration
of
justice
in
that
court
is
carried
out,
in
the
eyes
of
those
rulemakers
from
that
court
who
have
the
obligation,
both
judicially
and
congressionally,
to
make
such
rules
as
are
deemed
appropriate
and
necessary.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
yes,
sir.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
yes,
sir.
that
has
been...
that
is
a
part
of
the
record,
specifically
so
because
we
assumed
that
the
fifth
circuit
might
be
wondering
that
very
fact.
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
repetitiveness
of
pro
hac
vice
admission.
in
fact,
if
a
person
practices
there
often
enough,
he
will
likely
get
waivers
of
the
local
counsel
requirement
upon
simple
request,
once
he
demonstrates
his
own
abilities
to
know
the
rule,
to
perform
under
the
rules,
to
make
himself
present
at
all
times
needed.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
he
files
in
writing,
through
the
mail,
a
motion
to
become
enrolled
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
oh,
you
have
to
say
for
what
purpose,
yes.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
it's
a
motion
form--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--i
don't
really
know
whether
the
cart
and
the
horse,
who
comes
first.
there
is
a
procedure
to
handle
it--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--but
local
counsel
will
often
file
the
suit,
and
then
file
the
motion
asking
permission
far
attorney
x
or
attorney
frazier--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--that's
often
how
it's
done.
that's
the
way
i've
seen
it
done
in
the
few
cases
we've
got
with
local
counsel.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
eastern
district
discovery
rules
are
quite...
are
quite
intense.
they
require
a
lot
of
face-to-face
confrontational
meetings.
a
lot
of
the
pretrial
activity
is
done
personally
and
is
prohibited
by
telephone
or
the
mail.
some
of
the
early
scheduling
conferences
under
the
rules
require
the
trial
attorneys,
or
one
of
them,
to
be
present
with
a
magistrate,
to
go
through
the
whole
system.
as
you
approach
trial
the
routines
and
regimens
of
pretrial
settlement
require
the
attendance,
under
all
circumstances,
of
the
trial
attorneys.
there
is
a
need
for
the
personal
touch,
if
you
please
if
you
satisfy
the
eastern
district
rules.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
the
lawyers
in
the
area
know
it.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
well,
again,
i'm
not
trying
to
answer
you
in
the
abstract,
because
our
record
contains
evidence
from
accepted
experts
on
the
judicial
administration
in
the
eastern
district,
and
that
evidence
says
that
attorneys
from
away
give
the
court
more
trouble
than
those
who
are
logically,
normally
and
frequently
practicing
there.
now,
the
minority
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
sort
of
scoffed
at
that
evidence.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
those
from
shreveport
that
practice
in
the
eastern
district
usually
come
the
night
before
and
have
dinner
and
are
there
the
next
morning.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
mr.
frazler's
local
attorney
did
the
same
thing,
i
suppose.
he
was
admitted
pro
hac
vice
to
try
this
very
case
for
mr.
frazier.
there's
also
this
ominous
comparison
to
piper
that
we
perceive
in
the
applicant's
brief.
piper
is
very
different
from
frazier,
if
i
may
use
those
names
to
designate
those
cases.
first
of
all,
we're
talking
about
state
law
and
federal
law.
and
that
alone
is
a
big
distinction
between
the
piper
article
iv
problems
and
the
frazier
case.
in
piper
we
also
have
this
option
of
not
only
living
in
the
state
but
maintaining
an
office
in
the
state;
under
either
of
which
gives
you
automatic,
general
admission
to
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
and
more
importantly,
the
continuing
requirement
of
that
eligibility
puts
the
real
teeth
in
the
rule
in
frazier,
and
at
the
same
time
demonstrates
the
absurdity
of
the
rule
in
piper.
mrs.
piper
could
have
run
over
to
new
hampshire,
gotten
an
apartment
or
done
whatever
it
was
it
would
take
to
establish
residency,
gotten
admitted
to
the
court,
and
run
right
back
400
yards
to
her
nice
house
and
home.
and
it
would
have
made
no
difference
under
the
piper
rule,
because
once
certified,
once
admitted,
that
was
it;
you
could
go
to
nome,
alaska.
in
the
rule
under
scrutiny
here,
the
continuing
need
for
office
or
residence
is
clearly
proscribed.
and
it
you
have
neither,
then
you
must
fall
back
to
the
other
means
of
practicing
before
the
court,
on
the
pro
hac
vice
side.
the
subpoena
power
of
the
state,
of
the
court,
is
contiguous
with
the
subpoena
power
granted
in
the
state
proceedings.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
biloxi
is
closer,
yes,
sir.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
gulfport
is
even
closer.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
yes,
sir,
there
are
cities,
there
are
cities
in
states
that
are
shorter
in
distance
than
the
location
of
mr.
frazier's
residence.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
well,
my
comment
about
the
absurdity
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
piper
did
not
have
continuing
residency
or
continuing
office
maintenance
as
a
requirement.
that
was
my
comment
about
the
absurdity
in
piper,
only
that
you
could
run
over
there,
get
admitted,
and
then
for
all
time,
not
worry
about
it
again;
whereas
the
frazier
rule
requires
that
you
maintain
either
an
officer
or
a
residence.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
that
might
solve
a
lot
of
problems.
but
it's
arkansas
and
texas,
and
they'd
still
have
to
come
to
louisiana
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
if
that
same
rule...
yes,
sir,
justice
marshall,
that
would
certainly
be
true.
i
submit
you
could
live
on
one
side
and
practice
on
the
other,
though,
and
solve
those
problems.
no
rule
is
safe
from
better
rule
writing.
there
is
hardly
anything
that
you
can
look
at
a
second
time
and
not
find
a
better
way
of
addressing,
or
a
better
way
of
expressing
it,
or
perhaps
a
somewhat
softer
impact.
but
we're
not
here
trying
to
write
a
rule.
i
think
we
are
here
trying
to
review
and
to
see
if
this
rule
is
constitutional.
is
this
rule
appropriate?
now
to
look
at
that
issue,
as
i
see
it
you
look
first
to
the
reason
for
the
rule.
is
it
reasonable?
does
it
accomplish
the
purposes
for
which
it's
intended?
and
we
say
to
you
that
it
does.
you
then
look
and
see
if
it
is
harshly
discriminatory.
no
one
is
going...
everyone
is
not
going
to
be
treated
exactly
alike.
but
some
disparity
in
treatment
is
permitted
under
the
regimens
and
under
rules.
and
we
look
at
this
rule
and
we
ask
ourselves,
is
this
rule
appropriate
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
is
performed?
does
it
unduly
mistreat
mr.
frazier
and
other
people
similarly
situated?
and
under
the
evidence
of
record,
and
under
the
reasons
expressed
for
the
rule,
we
say
to
you
that
the
rule
is
the
only
appropriate
way
to
maintain
control
over
the
attorneys
that
are
practicing
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
and
the
only
way
to
do
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
minimally
impose
some
disparity
in
how
you
practice
there.
it
must
be
remembered
that
mr.
frazier
can
get
general
admission
anytime
he
wants
if
he
opens
an
office
or
if
he
lives
in
louisiana.
the
rule
is
there.
how
it
affects
a
person
depends
on
the
person's
motives
and
on
the
person's
conduct.
the
rule
is
very
objective.
it
says,
any
louisiana
lawyer
who
either
lives
or
practices
in
louisiana
is
generally
admitted.
that
lets
lawyers
come
to
louisiana,
leave
louisiana,
open
offices,
close
offices.
it
is
their
conduct
that
affects
the
ultimate
effect
of
the
rule
on
them.
we
submit
that
the
only
way
this
could
better
be
handled,
perhaps,
is
not
to
have
a
rule
at
all.
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
the
proper
carrying
out
of
the
congressional
and
judicial
mandates
on
the
eastern
district
court
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
and
obligations.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
suppose.
i
think
that
maintaining
an
office
would
carry
with
it
the
obligation
to
maintain
a
lawful
office,
not
just
a
sham--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--i
know
of
no
dropoffs.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
suppose
if
our
firm
would
have
put
mr.
frazier
of
counsel,
and
give
him
telephone
and
address
privileges,
we
would
probably
satisfy
the
rule.
but
then
we
would-be
holding
ourselves
out
as
vouching
for
mr.
frazier,
and
our
firm
would
in
effect
be
surrounding
mr.
frazier
with
our
reputation
and
with
our
obligations
to
that
court.
yes.
to
answer
you
more
directly,
yes.
that
would
satisfy
it.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
if
the
court
knew
it,
i
don't
believe
it
would.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
don't
believe
it
would.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
would
not...
the
rule
of
course
does
not
say,
whether
it
be
a
fancy
office
or
a
small
office
or--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
make
sure
he
gets
notice,
to
make
sure
he
gets
his
mall.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i'm
not
saying
that
it
wouldn't.
i'm
saying
that
i
suspect
that
the
court
would
require
more
than
a
drop,
if
you
please.
i
don't
know
that
it
would.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
well,
i
think
basically
the
purpose
of
having
the
rule,
and
having
the
office
or
the
residence
is,
as
you
point
out,
to
make
sure
that
notices
are
timely
received.
and
i
suppose
a
drop
would
satisfy
that.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
don't
think
a
mailbox
is
an
office.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
it's
not
just
a
question
of
assuring
the
court
that
mail
is
received.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
think
i
stepped
in
that
answer.
there's
more
to
it
than
that,
sir.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
it's
to
assure
the
court
that
the
attorneys
are
available.
it's
not
just
a
question
of
getting
there.
it's
a
question
of--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--i
don't
believe
we
have
multi-district
firm.
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
question.
i
think--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--no,
sir,
the
rule
doesn't
deal
with
firms,
it
deals
with
lawyers.
it
deals
with
a
person.
now
if
this
person
were
living
and
practicing
in
new
york
city,
he
obviously
wouldn't
qualify
for
general
admission--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--even
if
he
were
a
partner
of
the
firm,
he
is
still
mr.
smith,
and
mr.
smith
lives
and
practices
in
new
york
city.
as
i
would
interpret
it.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
justice
white,
i
suppose
it's
in
the
interest
of
trying
to
be
as
liberal
as
possible
that
this
alternative
option
is
granted.
if
the
court
really
wanted
to
be
restrictive,
and
wanted
to
have
its
law--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--in
my
view,
people
do
not
frivolously
undertake
overhead
of
offices.
if
a
person
is
going
to
maintain
an
office
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
there
is
going
to
have
to
be
a
reason
for
it
superior
to
an
ability
to
generally
practice
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
because
that
can
be
done
with
no
overhead.
that
can
be
clone
by
simple
motion
for
a
pro
hac
vice
admission.
so
the
fact
that
the
rule
allows
the
general
practice,
once
you
have
an
office,
presupposes
good
common
sense
on
the
part
of
the
attorney.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
would
think
that's
true.
and
i
think
also
the
fact
that
you
live
there
is
more--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--i
wish
i
had
said
it
that
way,
sir.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
corporate
headquarters,
i
suppose.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
again,
we're
talking
about
whether
it's
a
legitimate
office
of
that
particular
person
for
that--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--if
it's
an
office
yes,
sir,
i
suppose
it
would
have
to
be
if
it's
a
legitimate
office,
if
it
demonstrates
his
intent
to
practice
in
the
state.
this
could
be
a
lot
tougher,
you
know.
this
could
say,
if
you're
not...
if
you're
not
in
olney's
parish,
you're
not
going
to
be
generally
admitted
to
this
court.
and
a
lot
of
districts
have
very
restrictive
admission
rules.
i
think
the
eastern
district
has
compromised
the
liberality
with
the
necessity
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
expanding
it
to
the
entire
state
or
so
say
we.
now,
let
me
touch
one
more
time
on
this
100-mile
range
for
mr.
frazier,
and
in
his
case,
i
suppose
we
would
make
it
a
111-mile
range.
that
argument,
to
me,
is
an
argument
that
would
be
made
to
the
rulemaking
authority
at
the
time
they're
making
a
rule.
it
is
an
attempt
to
write
the
rule
differently,
to
write
the
rule
perhaps
more
restrictively
in
some
respects,
and
less
restrictively
in
others.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
there
is
a
judicial
conference
in
effect
in
the
fifth
circuit.
i
don't
know
the
precisity
of
the
review
of
the
admission
rules.
know
that
they
are
awaiting
hearing
from
this
court,
since
they
are
very
much
aware
of
this
writ.
but
the
rule
writing
and
the
rule
review
is
underway.
i
was
not
at
the
fifth
circuit
judicial
conference
two
weeks
ago,
but
i
understand
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
admission
rules
and
many
other
rules
of
the
various
district
courts
within
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
can't
give
you
a
time
or
date
by
which
any
work
would
be
completed.
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
i
understand
they're
considering,
as
i
understand
it,
they're
considering
some
uniformity,
not
requiring...
not
requiring
total
uniformity--
mr.
curtis
r.
boisfontaine
--but
they're
looking
at
the
extremes
of
rules
treating
the
same
subject,
with
a
view
toward
trying
to
bring
the
extremes
more
toward
a
center...
a
center
line.
i
think
that's
the
extent
of
the
uniformity
that
they
seek
to
achieve.
if
there
are
other
questions?
otherwise,
we
submit.
