mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
important
questions
about
the
practice
of
law
and
the
administration
of
justice
in
our
federal
district
courts.
at
issue
is
a
rule
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
which
requires
members
of
that
court's
bar
to
live
or
have
an
office
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
in
order
to
focus
on
the
precise
nature
of
the
dispute,
it's
useful
to
identify
what
this
rule
requires.
under
the
rule,
members
of
the
eastern
district
bar
must
be
located
in
the
eastern
district,
the
middle
district
or
the
western
district
of
louisiana.
and
in
order
to
see
how
the
rule
operates
vis-a-vis
the
petitioner,
it
may
be
useful
to
consult
the
map
that
we
prepared
in
our
opening
brief
as
an
appendix
at
page
6a.
mr.
frazier's
application
was
denied
because
he
lives
and
practices
in
pascagoula,
mississippi,
which
is
approximately
110
miles
from
new
orleans.
by
contrast,
a
lawyer
located
in
lake
charles,
louisiana,
which
is
200
miles
from
new
orleans,
may
be
admitted
to
the
eastern
district
bar,
and
a
lawyer
located
in
shreveport,
louisiana,
300
miles
from
new
orleans,
may
also
be
admitted
to
the
eastern
district
bar.
indeed,
lawyers
from
lake
charles
or
shreveport
may
serve
as
local
counsel
for
lawyers
such
as
mr.
frazier
in
practicing
in
new
orleans,
even
though
they're
twice
the
distance
from
the
courthouse.
in
our
brief,
we
have
advanced
several
reasons
why
we
believe
this
rule
is
invalid,
but
it
boils
down
to
essentially
one
complaint.
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
this
rule
is
both
overinclusive
as
well
as
underinclusive.
and
however
it
may
be
analyzed,
we
submit
that
it
does
not
advance
the
goals
of
lawyer
competence
and
availability
for
hearings
that
are
attributed
to
it.
in
our
view,
this
court's
decision
in
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
v.
piper
provides
the
proper
analytical
framework
for
deciding
the
case.
and
in
mentioning
piper,
i
want
to
focus
exactly
on
what
we
are
arguing
and
are
not
arguing.
we
recognize
that
piper
was
decided
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
iv,
which
is
a
direct
limitation
on
state
action
and
not
on
federal
action;
and
we
are
not
making
a
claim
for
relief
under
article
iv.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
rule
is
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
in
urging
the
court
to
so
hold,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
employ
the
analysis
that
was
used
in
piper
in
the
context
of
analyzing
this
rule,
just
as
the
court
has
incorporated
equal
protection
analysis
as
a
component
of
fifth
amendment
due
process.
there
are
several
reasons
why
we
believe
such
analysis
is
appropriate
here.
the
rule
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
with
its
exclusion
of
lawyers
from
out
of
the
state--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--the
distinction
in
this
case,
as
opposed
to
traditional
cases
where
congress
passes
a
law,
or
national
body
engages
in
linedrawing
of
that
nature,
is,
we
have
here
a
rule
that
was
adopted
by
a
local
unit
of
the
federal
government
that
is
exercising
delegated
authority,
not--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--it
is
an
exercise
of
delegated
authority.
but
when
the
line
is
drawn,
for
example,
if
the
epa
regional
officer
said
that
only
people
in
california
could
practice
before
us
or
something
of
that
nature,
when
the
linedrawing
by
a
local
entity
is
on
the
basis
of
state
lines,
there
are
problems
that
have
been
raised...
that
are
raised
by
that
of
the
sort
that
are
implicated
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
and
to
that
extent...
it's
one
thing
if
national
body
had
adopted
restrictions
of
this
nature,
saying...
making
that
kind
of
decision
and
that
kind
of
linedrawing.
but
it's
another
thing
for
a
local
unit
of
government,
in...
local
unit
of
the
federal
government,
in
consultation
with
local
lawyers
in
this
case,
to
try
to
be
exercising
that
kind
of
discretion.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
if
congress
had
passed
this
rule,
we
would
not
be
arguing
that
it
should
be
analyzed
under
privileges
and
immunities
analysis.
there
would
be
equal
protection
arguments
that
would
be
made,
but
the
problem
here
that
we
think
should
trigger
the
type
of
privileges
and
immunities
analysis
is
the
fact
that
it's
a
local
unit
of
the
government,
using
delegated
authority,
and
that
it
has
an
exclusionary
effect
that
the
court
has
recognized
raised
problems
requiring
heightened
consideration
if
it
were
enacted
in
a
state
court
system.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
in
this
case,
when
i
refer
to
the
local
unit,
i'm
referring
to
the
united
states
district
court,
which
has
rulemaking
authority.
but
unlike
delegated
authority
in
the
context
of
agencies,
there
are
possibilities
of
dealing
with
any
such
rules
through
the
agency
process.
in
this
case,
the
court
has
some
degree...
the
local
district
court
has
autonomy
in
this
respect.
it
shares
its
rulemaking
authority
with
this
court,
but
it
tends
to
operate
on
parallel
tracks.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
the
rule
is
autonomous
unless,
of
course,
it
comes
before
this
court.
the
rule,
or
the
exclusion
of
nonresidence
is
final
unless
of
course
it
comes
before
a
higher
body
such
as
this
court
which
would
also
have
the
authority
to
regulate.
but
the
point
is,
that
when
rules
of
this
nature
are
adopted
at
a
regional
level
or
a
local
level,
i
mean
the
exclusion
is
against
residents
of
other
states.
the
court
has
said,
admittedly
in
the
context
of
state
discrimination,
discrimination
by
state
entities
of
government,
that
there
are
special
problems.
the
court
has
also
said
in
the
equal
protection
area...
and
we've
cited
several
of
the
tax
cases
from
recent
terms
of
the
court...
that
there
are
similar
problems
when
the
court...
when
state
governments
pass
legislation
also
that
discriminate
or
have
the
effect
of
charging
higher
fees
or
imposing
burdens
on
out-of-staters
as
well,
under
equal
protection
analysis,
which
would
apply
in
the
context
of
federal
action
as
well.
but
i
think
there
are
reasons,
even
if
the
court
should
not
proceed
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
analysis,
for
using
a
heightened
form
of
scrutiny
here.
there
is
no
reason
why
it
is
that
federal
district
courts
should
be
able
to
adopt
exclusionary
rules
of
this
sort
when
the
court
said
in
piper
that
they
cannot
be
adopted
in
the
context
of
a
state
court
system;
particularly
when
the
reasons
that
are
given
for
this
type
of
exclusion
are
the
same
that
the
court
considered
and
rejected
in
the
piper
case.
the
court's
decision
in
hurd
v.
hodge,
which
we
cited,
suggested
that
it...
they
said
in
that
case,
bad
public
policy,
it
wasn't
constitutionally
grounded,
for
federal
courts
to
be
able
to,
in
that
case,
enforce
certain
contracts
that
state
courts
couldn't;
and
it's
bad
public
policy
here
to
allow
federal
district
courts
to
adopt
rules
that
could
not
be
adopted
in
the
state
court
system.
state
court
judges,
no
less
than
federal
judges,
are
concerned
with
the
competence
of
the
lawyers
who
appear
before
them.
they're
concerned
with
the
availability
of
having
lawyers
who
can
appear
before
them
in
cases.
and
there
is
no
reason
for
saying
that
there
are
special
problems
in
the
federal
court
system
that
are
cured
by
having
this
type
of
restriction
on
lawyers.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
believe
so.
i
believe
that
the
court's
decision
in
piper
and
the
reasoning
in
piper
is
broad
enough
to
include
that.
justice
white's
concurring
opinion
in
that
case
read
the
court
as
reaching
that
far,
because
the
same
problems
that
you
have
with
exclusions
based
on
residence
appear
also
with
exclusions...
or
with
an
in-state
office
requirement.
the
in-state
office
requirement
acts
as
a
surrogate
for
a
residence
requirement.
what
it
does
is,
it
requires
lawyers
from
out
of
the
state
who
practice
out
of
the
state
to
open
an
additional
office
in
louisiana,
which
is
not
a
burden
imposed
upon
local
lawyers.
i
mean,
for
louisiana
lawyers,
an
in-state
office
requirement
is
largely
not
much
of
a
restriction
and
not
much
of
a
burden
at
all.
the
chances
are,
they
probably
have
it.
but
for
the
court
to
require
that
out
of
state
lawyers
must
have
that
office
in
addition,
it
places
burdens
on
citizens
of
other
states,
which
as
a
practical
matter,
are
not
imposed
on
local
courts.
that
was
the
holding
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
the
gordon
case
which
we
cited,
where
the
same
option
was
available
for
people
applying
to
the
state
court
bar.
you
could
either
take
the
new
york
state
bar
exam,
you
had
to
be
either
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar,
or
you
had
to
practice
in
the
state
before
you
were
admitted.
and
the
court
reasoned
that
the
same
type
of
problems
that
are
posed
by
a
residence
requirement
are
posed
by
the
requirement
that
you
must
have
an
office
in
the
state,
when
that's
not
imposed...
or
it's
not
as
burdensome
as
it
is
on--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--you
mean
the
district
court?
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
let
me
break
that
down
into
two
parts,
justice
scalia.
i
think
piper
reasoned
that
one's
location
or
one's
distance
from
the
court
is
not
a
reason
for
disqualifying
someone
for
being
admitted
to
the
bar.
i
think
the
court
answered
that
question
in
piper
when
it
said
that
there
maybe
some
times,
as
a
practical
matter,
when
a
lawyer
cannot
appear,
when
the
lawyer
is,
as
the
court
put
it,
at
a
great
distance
from
the
court.
in
those
cases,
local
counsel
may
be
required.
we
submit
that
a
rule
which
did
have
that
kind
of
circular
or
circumferential
approach,
would
be
more
closely
based
on
the
court's
goal.
if
it
were
100
miles,
or
150
miles,
or
200
miles,
that's
closer
in
terms
of
the
goal
attributed
to
it,
which
is
assuring
that
lawyers
are
available.
the
vice
with
this
particular
rule,
as
we
see
it,
is
that
it
says,
lawyers
300
miles
west
of
new
orleans
may
be
admitted
to
the
bar
and
may
practice
without
local
counsel,
but
not
lawyers
who
are
only
100
miles
to
the
east.
we
submit
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
lawyers
from
300
miles
away
are
more
likely
to
come
over
to
new
orleans,
but
not
lawyers
that
are
only
100
miles
to
the
east.
and
however
the
line
may
be
drawn,
150
miles,
200
miles,
it's
probably
likely
to
be
more
closely
tailored
to
the
goal
than
the
current
rule,
which
focuses
on
state
lines,
and
excludes
people
who
may
be
perfectly
capable
of
practicing
law.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
no,
justice
stevens.
part
of
the
problem
is
that
even
it
you
were
to
limit
it
to
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
it's
narrower,
but
in
this
case,
it
has
some
of
the
same
problems.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
in
footnote
six
of
its
opinion
that
there
are
some
lawyers
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
who
are
further
away
from
new
orleans
than
mr.
frazier.
the
geography
of
districts
is
such
that
in
many
instances
you
may
have
these
anomalies.
let
me
give
you
a
local
example.
let
us
suppose,
for
example,
that
there
were
a
rule
of
this
sort
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
which
covers
approximately
the
eastern
one-third
of
the
state,
and
which
has
divisions
that
sit
in
alexandria,
in
richmond,
and
in
norfolk.
and
in-district
office
rule
would
mean
that
lawyers
from
norfolk,
virginia,
could
come
up
and
practice
in
alexandria
without
restriction,
whereas
lawyers
in
the
district
of
columbia,
which
is
only
ten
miles
away,
as
opposed
to
180
miles
away,
could
not.
now,
that's
in
a
situation
where
you
have
multiple
districts.
you
have
other
states
where
there's
only
one
district.
so
an
in-district
rule,
say
in
the
district
of
kansas,
would
let
lawyers
from
western
kansas
come
into
kansas
city,
kansas,
and
practice
in
the
district
court
there,
but
not
lawyers
across
the
street
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
what
we're
saying
is,
whatever
kind
of
tailoring
or
rule
may
be
adopted,
the
current
rule
does
not
satisfy.
300
miles
in
one
direction,
you're
in;
100
miles
in
the
other
direction,
you're
not
in,
is
not
even
close,
we
submit,
even
whatever
anomalies
may
occur
around
the
edges
with
a
more
closely
tailored
rule.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
yes...
let
me
answer
the
question.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
think
what
piper
recognized...
i
mean,
you're
right,
justice
marshall,
but,
again,
i
would
break
it
down
into
two
parts.
i
think
piper
said
that
one
cannot
be
excluded
from
a
bar
just
because
one
is
in
texas
or
alaska
or
another
state.
piper
also
said
that
if
lawyers
are
at
a
great
distance,
and
if
the
court
should
determine
that
people
more
than
300
miles
away
are
a
great
distance,
then
one
could
require
texas
lawyers
or
alaska
lawyers
to
retain
local
counsel.
we're
not
challenging
that.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
linedrawing
that
has
occurred
here
has
created
problems
that...
and
does
not
advance
the
court's
goals
in
ensuring
that
lawyers
are
able
to
come
down
to
new
orleans.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i'm
sorry?
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
to
practice
in
federal
court?
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
believe
there
are
states
where
you
are
admitted
by
a
particular
county.
i
believe--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
i'm
not
sure
to
what
extent
that
would
survive
the
court's
decision
in
piper.
i
think
that
particular
situation
i
think
is
addressed
in
the
court's
decision
in
united
building
construction
trades
union
v.
the
city
of
camden,
where
certain
jobs
were
reserved
only
for
residents
of
camden
but
not
for
people
in
other
parts
of
new
jersey.
i
think
there
might
be
problems
in
that
nature,
after
the
camden
decision
and
after
the
piper
decision,
with
that
kind
of
county-based
rule.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
in
louisiana?
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
the
rule
here
required
membership
in
the
state
bar.
i
am
not
sure
that
there
are
restrictions
in
terms
that
if
you
are
admitted...
or
if
you
are
admitted
in
orleans
parish,
that
means
you
cannot
practice
over
in
baton
rouge.
i
don't
know
the
current
requirement,
but
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
it's
critical,
because
the
rule
says,
you
must
have
an
office
or
reside
somewhere
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
it's
not
specific
by
parish;
it's
not
specific
by
district.
and
that
has
caused
the
problems
that
we
have
attributed...
that
we
have
cited.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
no,
actually,
the
subpoena
power
extends
further.
under
45(e)
the
subpoena
power
would
extend,
to
appear
at...
for
depositions
or
trial
extends
100
miles
into
mississippi.
it
was
an
argument
that
was
stated
in
respondent's
brief.
and
so
it's
not
perfectly
contiguous
with
the
state
boundaries.
but
i
would
point
out
again,
the
subpoena
power
raises
issues
that
are
somewhat
different.
i
mean,
in
that
situation
people
who
are
disadvantaged
are
in-state
residents.
people
from
shreveport
who
are
subpoenaed
to
appear
at
trial
in
new
orleans
have
to
travel
further
that
someone
from
mississippi.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
or
within
the
state,
correct.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
it's
a--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i
would
turn
that
around,
because
i
think
the
point
actually
helps
us
here.
what
congress
said
by
adopting
a
rule
of
that
nature,
is
that
we
are
designing
a
rule
for
the
convenience
of
witnesses,
and
we
will
make
a
judgment
that
it
is
convenient
for
witnesses
to
come
in
from
anywhere
in
the
state;
that
if
they're
300
miles
they
won't
be
inconvenienced;
and
well
also
extend
that
so
that
lawyers...
or
that
witnesses
from
the
other
part
of
the
state
may
be
brought
in,
too.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
what
it
parallels
is
the
fact,
again,
congress
did
let
in
people
from
out
of
state.
this
rule
does
not.
and
therein
lies
a
distinction.
even
if
it's
not
perfectly
symmetrical,
there
are
people
who
are
allowed
in
from
mississippi,
or
from
other
places,
if
that
falls
within
the
boundary.
the
problem
with
this
case
is
that
it
is
drawn
strictly
on
state
lines,
and
even
under
the
availability,
the
argument
that
says,
let's
have
lawyers
who
are
available,
that
still
lets
in
people
from
300
miles
away.
it
says,
they're
convenient
enough,
they
can
come
down
here;
but
not
lawyers,
people
who
are
being
brought
in
involuntarily,
but
not
lawyers
from
southern
mississippi
who
voluntarily
want
to
practice.
we
say,
we
are
willing,
we
want
to
build
a
regular
practice
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
with
all
the
burdens
and
responsibilities
that
entails,
and
we're
willing
to
submit
to
that.
but
they
are
excluded.
and
the
reasons
about
having
lawyers
available
just
cannot
apply,
we
submit,
in
that
context.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
my
client
lives
110
miles
away,
so
that
poses
certain
problems
here.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
but
i
think--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i
could
argue
that
would
be
perfectly
constitutional.
the
problem
is
that,
again,
rule
45
deals
with
different
concerns,
it
deals
with
the
convenience
of
witnesses
who
are
coming
in,
not
lawyers
who
are
seeking
to
appear
and
build
a
regular
practice,
and
who
want
to
submit
to
whatever
requirements,
who
insist
that
they
are
willing
to
come
on
over
to
new
orleans,
to
show
up,
and
to
do
whatever
is
required.
it's,
we
submit,
apples
and
oranges.
i
want
to
deal
with
one
of
the
other
distinctions
that
was
raised
by
the
respondents,
and
that's
the
fact
that
this
rule
is
a
continuing
requirement,
rather
than
the
rule
in
piper
which
was
just
limited
to,
lawyers
had
to
reside
at
the
day
that
they
were
admitted.
the
problem
is
that
that
was
only
one
of
the
defects,
we
submit
that
occurred
in
that
particular
case.
and
i
don't,
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion,
making
the
rule
in
piper
more
restrictive
would
not
have
addressed
the
questions
there.
the
problem
remains,
even
with
a
continuing
requirement,
that
it
is
as
overinclusive
as
it
is
underinclusive.
it
allows
in
lawyers
from
far
away
in
new
orleans,
even
if
they
don't
practice
law
as
litigators.
even
if
they
engage
in
a
real
estate
practice,
and
don't
ever
appear
in
federal
court.
while
it
excludes
experienced
litigators,
such
as
the
petitioner,
who
are
also
closer
to
the
court.
so
the
continuing
requirement
does
not
save
it.
we
have
argued
the
reasons
why
we
believe
that
heightened
scrutiny
ought
to
be
applied
under
the
court's
decision
in
piper.
but
even
if
the
court
should
decide
not
to
adopt
the
reasoning
in
piper
here,
we
submit
that
the
case
can
still
be
resolved
under
the
court's
traditional
equal
protection
analysis
that's
an
element
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
heightened
scrutiny,
we
think,
would
be
appropriate
under
the
standards
that
are
used
for
that
analysis,
the
fundamental
right
or
suspect
class,
or
even
the
intermediate
level
of
scrutiny.
in
piper,
the
court
declared
that
the
right
to
practice
law,
or
the
opportunity
to
pursue
one's
career,
was
fundamental
for
purposes
of
article
iv,
and
i
think
the
reasoning
would
apply
here
as
well.
but
even
if
it
didn't,
the
distinctions
that
are
drawn
about
in-state
residents
are
allowed
to
practice,
but
not
out-of-state
practices,
if
not
suspect
class,
at
least
raise
what
the
court
referred
to
as
recurring
constitutional
difficulties,
in
cases
such
as
plyler
and
cleburne
living
center.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
out
of
state
residents
are
being
excluded,
even
though
there
may
be
many
valid
reasons
for
allowing
in-state
residents,
and
even
though
the
exclusion
may
not
rationally
or
in
other
ways
advance
the
goals
that
are
attributed
to
it.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
the
tenth
circuit
after
piper
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
that
might
be
valid
or
not.
i
would
say...
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause...
i
would
say,
however,
that
louisiana
might
be
one
state,
the
only
state
or
the
best
state,
in
which
that
kind
of
restriction
could
be
upheld.
to
answer
the
question,
i
would
have
to
look
at
what
the
arguments
were
advanced
in
favor
of
requiring
that
sort
of
a
requirement--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--it
would
depend
on
the
evidence
that
was
put
in.
as
a
practical
matter,
in
federal
district
courts,
something
like
70
to
75
percent
of
cases
are
federal
cases--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i'm
not
aware...
i've
seen
the
number
generally
in
several...
broken
down
by
circuits.
i'm
not
aware
specifically
in
louisiana.
but
i
think
that--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--that
would
be
a
more
substantial
reason.
but
i
would
note,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
already
a
member
of
the
louisiana
state
bar,
so
the
issue
is
not
implicated
here.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
absolutely,
justice
white.
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
here.
mr.
frazier
can
try
cases
on
his
own
in
the
state
courts
in
new
orleans.
but
if
he
files
a
case,
and
let's
suppose
the
defendant
tries
to
remove
it
to
federal
district
court,
he
can't
represent
his
client
any
more
on
his
own
because
he
cannot
be
admitted
to
the
eastern
district
bar
under
this
rule.
he
has
to
find
a
local
counsel,
or
affiliate
with
another
lawyer--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--the
court
of
appeals...
the
judicial
council
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
reviewing
the
rules
of
the
district
courts
for
consistency.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
this
may
be
one
of
them,
yes.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
don't
know
for
certain.
the
court
of
appeals
said
at
the
end
of
its
opinion
that
it
was
unwilling
to
get
into
the
issue
because
the
matter
is
under
review.
we're
not
aware--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--it
may
be
under
review,
perhaps
counsel
for
respondents
could
answer
it.
but
i
would
note
rule
83
was
amended...
was
adopted
by
the
court
nearly
two
years
ago,
and
the
rule
has
not
been
changed
yet,
and
we're
not
aware
of
when
any
change
would
be
imminent,
and
we're
not
aware
of
whether
the
change
in
the
rule
would
affect
petitioner
or
allow
him
to
be
admitted
to
the
court.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
this
type
of
rule
is
present
in
about
24
federal
districts
across
the
country.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
in
a
number
of
others,
this
rule
puts
the
two
together,
where
one
must
have
an
office
or
residence
in
the
state.
a
number
of
the
other
districts,
there
are
some
such
as
southern
mississippi
which
don't
have
these
kinds
of
restrictions,
interestingly
enough.
but
in
other
districts,
what
they
may
have
is
two
rules.
number
one,
one
can
be
admitted
to
the
bar
if
one
meets
the
educational
and
practice
requirements,
without
any
restriction.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
of
the
state
bar...
a
member
of
the
state
bar,
or
the
bar
of
any
other
state.
but
they
then
add
a
restriction
that
says
if
any
lawyer
who
enters
an
appearance
in
the
case
must
be
affiliated
with
local
counsel.
so
in
effect
there
are
two
rules,
but
it
has
the
same
practical
effect
as
this
particular
rule.
and
if
the
court
should
agree
with
us,
we
would
hope
that
they
would
focus
on
that
as--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i'm
not
aware
of
exactly
how
many
allow--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--who
allow
you
to
practice
in
the
district
court
if
you're
a
member
of
the
state
bar?
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
yes,
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
for
example.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
don't
know.
i
didn't,
when
i
was
surveying
the
rules
i
didn't
focus
on
membership
in
state
bar,
and
whether
that
was--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--with
respect
to
the
admission
to
the
state
bar?
i
meant
the
mr.
frazier
is
admitted
to
the
louisiana
state
bar.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
other...
well,
other
courts--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i
don't
want
to
limit
it
to
the
southern
mississippi.
i
have
to
confess,
because
mr.
frazier
is
a
member
of
the
state
bar
in
louisiana,
i
didn't
focus
on
how
that
requirement
is
applied.
there
are
other
districts,
i
believe
in
texas
as
well,
that
require
one
to
be
either
a
member
of
the
texas
bar
or
the
bar
of
any
other
court.
i
could
submit
a
summary
of
those
requirements
it
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
but
the
point
is,
whatever
educational
or
bar
admission
requirements
one
may
impose,
this
type
of
rule
deals
with
other
questions.
whatever
educational
qualifications
one
may
require
or
practice
requirements
that
is
not
related
to
the
question
of
whether
one
lives
or
practices
in
the
state
and
therefore,
one
is
competent
practitioner
or
likely
to
be
available.
mr.
frazier
has
met
whatever
educational
qualifications
and
practice
and
bar
admission
qualifications
that--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--no,
when
he
was
admitted--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--no,
louisiana
did
not
have
a
residency
requirement,
and
that
was
the
case
before
piper
as
well
as
after
piper.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i'm
not
certain.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
at
this
point,
we'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
the
time.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
wanted
to
follow
up
on
the
question
of
the
office
requirement,
justice
stevens'
inquiry.
it
was
addressed
in
the
record.
at
page
151,
mrs.
white,
the
clerk,
said
that
a
mailbox
is
not
sufficient.
at
page
255,
judge
wicker
testified
that
the
office
requirement
requires
only
that
there
be
someone
to
answer
the
telephone
and
communicate
with
the
lawyer.
and
i
would
add
again
that
that
could
be
in
new
orleans,
or
it
could
be
in
lake
charles,
or
it
could
be
in
shreveport,
or
it
could
be
anywhere
else.
mr.
frazier
can
affiliate
with
an
office...
somebody
who
has
an
office
in
lake
charles,
and
he
would
satisfy
the
office
requirement.
but
there's
no
reason
to
believe--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--the
statement
was,
and
i
will
quote
from
the
record,
quote:
this
means
where
there
is
an
address
with
a
telephone
number
to
me.
question:
somebody
such
as
a
secretary?
answer:
someone
who
would
be
able
to
communicate
with
that
individual
if
we
attempted
to
reach
them.
that
is
the
only
answer.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
yes.
that
is
permitted.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
excuse
me?
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
it
says
someone...
you
know,
secretary
with
the
office.
and
again,
it
doesn't
say
where,
it
doesn't
say
somebody
who
is
committed
to
regularly
practicing
in
the
eastern
district.
it
could
be
somebody--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--but
it
doesn't
imply
that
there
is
someone
there
who
could
go
over
to
the
courthouse
for
emergency
hearings
or
something
of
that
nature.
