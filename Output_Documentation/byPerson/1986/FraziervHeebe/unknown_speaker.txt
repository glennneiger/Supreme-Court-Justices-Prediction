unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
hitchcock,
before
you
go
any
further,
that's
a
little
difficult
to
do,
because
the
privileges
and
immunities
analysis
prevents
discrimination
between
citizens
from
different
states,
rights,
on
the
basis
of
statehood.
but
the
federal
government
does
that
all
the
time,
and
the
constitution
specifically
says
when
it
is
that
the
government
can't
discriminate
between
the
states,
in
certain
types
of
taxation
for
example.
but
the
government
very
often
provides
particular
benefits
or
takes
particular
action
which
just
affects
one
state
and
not
others.
so
how
can
you
possibly
apply
the
state
discrimination
concept
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
to
the
due
process
clause?
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
treat
that
differently
from
something
enacted
by
congress?
i
mean,
supposing
the
regional
director
of
the
epa
in
san
francisco
adopts
a
particular
rule.
now,
it
may
have
problems
with
parochialism,
but
nonetheless,
we
treat
is
an
exercise
of
delegated
authority
from
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
that
if
conress
had
adopted
this,
you
would
have
no
claim?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
a
local
unit
of
government.
i
mean,
that
has
some
meaning
applied
to
a
state
where
you
have
a
state
constitution
th8at
gives
municipalities
certain
powers,
whether
the...
whether
the
county
or
whether
the
state
government
desires
it,
willy-nilly.
but...
but
in
the
federal
context,
i
don't
know
of
any
federal
local
units.
i
know
of
certain
representatives
of
the
federal
government
that
exist
on
a
local
level,
but
they're
all
governed
entirely
by
the
will
of
the
entire
federal
government.
that
have
no
local
autonomy,
none
of
these
units,
as
far
as
i
know,
including
this
court.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
arguing
at
the
same
time
that
this
court...
you're
urging
as
one
of
your
points
in
your
brief
that
we
should
exercise
our
supervisory
authority.
doesn't
this
necessarily
mean
that
this
is
not
a
local
unit?
unknown
speaker
are
you
sure
that
it
would
be
unlawful
for
a
state
to
adopt
the
kind
of
rule
the
federal
court
has
here?
this
is
not,
as
in
piper,
a
restriction
against
residents
of
other...
or
against
citizens
of
other
states
practicing
within
the
state;
it's
simply
a
requirement
that
there
be
an
office
within
the
state.
now
are
you
sure
that
a
state
couldn't
adopt
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
suggest
we
substitute
for
it?
if
the
state
wants
to
preserve
the
kind
of
interest
that
it
says
is
protected
by
the
office
requirement.
unknown
speaker
yes,
200-mile
rule?
300-mile
rule?
what
possible
rule
could
there
be?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hitchcock,
do
you
think
this
rule
would
be
acceptable
if
it
limited
admission
to
lawyers
who
were
admitted
in...
who
had
offices
or
resided
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana?
unknown
speaker
if
you
require
perfect
tailoring,
you
can
find
some
flaw
in
any
rule
that
lays
down
any
principle
like
that.
but
our
equal
protection
clauses
in
this
area
have
never
required
perfect
tailoring.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
same
rule
have
to
apply
to
texas,
alaska,
and
rhode
island?
unknown
speaker
that's
going
to
be
a
little
tough?
unknown
speaker
i've
been
to
some
states
that
require
you
to
belong
to
the
bar
of
the
county
that
you
filed
a
case
in--
unknown
speaker
--or
to
hire
a
lawyer
who
is
a
member
of
the
bar
of
that
county.
unknown
speaker
no,
sir,
in
state...
i
said
state
courts.
aren't
there
states
that
have
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
want
to
practice
in
the
other
country,
you
have
to
hire
a
local
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
xxx
louisiana?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
have
to
belong
to
the
parish
to
file
a
case
in
the
parish?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hitchcock,
there
is
some
coincidence,
is
there
not,
between
this
rule
of
the
district
court,
and
the
extent
of
the
subpoena
power
of
that
court?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
but
it's
100
miles
or
within
the
state?
unknown
speaker
now,
that's
not
a
perfectly,
equitable
match,
as
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
for
this
rule.
unknown
speaker
congress
didn't
think
it
necessary,
you
know,
to
draw
concentric
circles
around
each
district
court
and
say,
the
subpoena
power
is
only
within
that
area.
it
does...
it
does
produce
some
inequities.
but
given
that
we
have
a
state
system,
congress
says,
the
subpoena
power
runs
anywhere
within
the
state.
unknown
speaker
what
the
district
court
is
saying,
we're
making
a
judgment
that
it's
convenient,
and
therefore
possible,
for
lawyers
to
come
here
for
quick
hearings
from
anywhere
within
the
state,
just
as
congress
says
it's
convenient
for
any
witness.
i
don't
know
why
that
doesn't
parallel
what
congress
has
done.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
settle
for
the
same
rule
that
applies
to
subpoenas?
that
is,
you
have
to
have
an
office
within
louisiana
or
within
100
miles
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
do
that.
unknown
speaker
110
miles,
would
that
make
you
happy?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hitchcock,
do
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
if
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
simply
cut
out
the
geography
rule,
but
maintained
its
rule
that
every
member
of
the
bar
there
had
to
be
admitted
to
the
louisiana
bar?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
asked
you
what
your
opinion
was
about
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
one
of
them
being
that,
well,
a
lot
of
the
cases
are
going
to
involve
elements
of
louisiana
law,
diversity
cases
and
that
sort
of
thing.
and
we
don't
give
a
special
bar
exam.
we
want
some
evidence
that
you
know
the
louisiana
law.
unknown
speaker
but
can
you
say
that
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
that
the
general
rule,
general
percentage
were
75
percent,
but
in
louisiana
it
were
only
40
percent.
do
you
think
the
eastern
district
can
pass
a
rule
that
governs
it,
even
though
it
might
not
work
in
other
districts?
unknown
speaker
xxx
he
can...
he
can
try
cases
in
the
state
court
in
new
orleans?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hitchcock,
doesn't,
the
court
of
appeals
have
a
study
underway
about
rules
in
this
respect?
unknown
speaker
with
respect...
and
as
part
of
their
focus,
on
these
rules
permitting...
restricting
practice?
unknown
speaker
may
be?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
it
is,
so
this
very
matter
must
be
under
review?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
how
prevalent
these
kinds
of
restrictions
are
across
the
country?
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
others,
what's
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
many
districts
have
a
rule
that
if
you're
a
member
of
the
state
bar,
you
may
practice
in
the
federal
district
court,
even
if
you're
a
nonresident?
unknown
speaker
are
there
some?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
all,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
all
the
district
courts
the
country
except
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
have
either
this
rule
that
this
court
has
here,
or
its
equivalent,
that's
pretty
telling
about
what
local
district
courts
think
is
good
for
their...
a
good
rule
for
running
their
business.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
but
i
take
it
that
other
courts
that
will
either
have
this
rule
or
impose
a
requirement
that
he
associate
with
local
counsel.
unknown
speaker
all
but
the
southern
district
of
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
oh,
that's
all
right.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
hitchcock,
i
know
that
your
client
now
is
not
a
resident
or
have
an
office
in
louisiana.
when
he
was
admitted
to
the
louisiana
bar,
was
he
required
to
be
either
a
resident
or
have
an
office?
unknown
speaker
the
louisiana
state
bar
just
doesn't
have
any
requirement
of
this
kind
at
all?
unknown
speaker
is
it
integrated?
unknown
speaker
expand
upon
showing
of
need.
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
don't
have
a
residency
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
ask
this
question?
as
i
understand
the
holding
in
leis
v.
flynet
a
local
court
does
not
have
to
allow
pro
hac
vice
admissions
if
it
doesn't
want
to;
it's
totally
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
local
judges.
supposing
they
change
their
rule
on
pro
hac
vice
and
just
say,
we
decided
we
want
to
have
the
same
requirement
on
pro
hac
vice.
you've
got
to
be...
either
have
an
office
or
be
a
resident.
would
that
change
the
constitutional
or
the
supervisory
power
issues
in
anyway?
unknown
speaker
so
you
really...
although
you
say
it
really
isn't
as
severe
as
your
opponent
makes
out,
you
don't
really
rely
on
the
fact
that
there
are
these
alternative
methods?
your
legal
position
is--
unknown
speaker
--the
judges
could
just
flatly
exclude
this
man
it
they
wanted
to?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boisfontaine?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
leave
to
practice
pro
hac
vice
is
liberally
granted.
but
would
it
be
liberally
granted
to
the
same
person
who
came
back
time
and
again?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
how,
in
a
case...
say
this
man
wanted
to
file
a
complaint
on
behalf
of
a
client.
what
procedure
does
he
follow
to
get
permission
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
have
a
number...
not
with
reference
to
any
particular
case,
he
just
says
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
it's
just
a
letter
saying--
unknown
speaker
--because
he
can't
file
a
complaint
with
his
name
on
it
until
he
first
has
the
pro
hac
vice
permission,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
also
has...
he
also
has
to
be
associated
with
local
counsel.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
how
it's
done
all
the
time?
unknown
speaker
does
the
evidence
indicate
that
the
problem
with...
it's
harder
to
comply
with
the
rules
of
the
federal
court
than
it
is
of
the
state
courts?
because
i
guess
he
doesn't
have
to
do
this
in
the
state
courts,
he
just
files
his
complaint.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
that...
don't
you
suppose
the
lawyers
know
that
in
the
area?
unknown
speaker
if
he
is
going
to
file
a
suit,
he
must
presumably
realize
that
he
has
that
responsibility,
assuming
he's
a
professionally
qualified
person?
unknown
speaker
just
like
those
from
shreveport?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
ones...
people
from
mississippi
could
do
the
same
thing.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
you're
talking
about
the
absurdity
in
the
other
case.
i
take
it
there
are
cities
in
mississippi
that
are
closer
that
pascagoula.
isn't
biloxi
closer
for
example?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
there
are
some
right
across
the
river,
aren't
there?
unknown
speaker
gulfport
was
the
one
i
was
trying
to
think
of.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
know
why
you
say
it
was
so
absurd
in
the
piper
case.
i
don't
know
why
the
lawyer
in
gulfport
would
be
any
different
than
the
lawyer
in
piper.
unknown
speaker
in
a
town
like
texarkana,
you'd
have
to
have
offices
on
both
sides
of
the
street?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
talking
about
if
this
was
a
texas
law,
i
like
the
louisiana
law,
and
you
lived
on
one
side
of
main
street
in
texarkana,
you'd
have
to
have
an
office
of
the
other
side
of
the
same
street?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boisfontaine,
may
i
ask
you
as
kind
of
a
practical
matter,
what
do
they
do?
do
a
lot
of
them
just
have
sort
of
like
a
corporation
trust
company,
they
have
some
office
where
they
can
go
in
and
have
the
receptionist
take
phone
calls
for
them?
that
will
do
it,
i
suppose,
put
the
name
on
the
door?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
sham
in
the
sense
of--
unknown
speaker
--say
one
of
the
larger
firms
knew
about
this
problem
and
said,
we'll
be
glad
to
put
your
name
on
the
door
and
take
your
phone
calls
and
be
sure
your
mail
is
forwarded?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
your
firm
would...
say
he
had
a
client
in
the
shipping
business
or
something.
and
they
said,
well,
you
can
use...
we'll
let
our
switchboard
take
your
calls,
and
you
can
use
this
as
an
office
for
taking
mail
and
so
forth.
and
his
client
just...
and
he
just
listed
that
office
and
phone
number.
would
that
satisfy
the
rule?
i
don't
know
it
wouldn't.
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
wouldn't?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
definition
of
the
kind
of
office
he
has
to
maintain?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
only
purpose
of
the
rule
to
be
sure
he
gets
notice
and
gets
his
mail?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
wouldn't
it
satisfy
to
have
a
client
say
you
can--
unknown
speaker
--why?
what
purpose
does
it
serve,
other
than
the
drop
purpose?
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
a
mailbox
might
do
it.
if
you
kept
a
mailbox
at
general
delivery.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
but
i
would
think
as
long
as
he
had
a
client
who
was
willing
to
put
his
name
on
the
door,
and
a
phone
number
that
he
could
list
in
your
lawyers'
directory,
i
don't
know
why
that
wouldn't
comply.
are
you
sure,
mr.
boisfontaine,
the
only
purpose
is
to
give
him...
to
make
sure
that
notice
is
received?
certified
mail
would
do
that.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
so.
i
thought
the
purpose
was
to
make--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
have
one
of
these
multistate
law
firms,
you
have
them
i'm
sure
in
new
orleans
as
we
do
in
other
parts
of
the
country,
and
you've
got
a
new
york
partner
up
there,
and
he's
going
to
try
the
case
and
so
forth.
does
he
have
an
office
there?
he's
never
in
new
orleans
except
for
the
purpose
of
this
one
case.
does
he
have
to
get
pro
hac
vice
admission?
he's
a
member
of
the
bar.
this
fellow
moves
to
new
york.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying...
you're
suggesting
that
the
rule
requires
a
certain
number
of
days
a
week
in
the
office
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
even
if
he
became
a
partner
of
your
firm?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
a
lawyer
leases
an
office
and
has
a
secretary
there,
but
he
lives
in
mississippi.
and
he
may
be
able
to
get
his
mail,
but
he's
still
away,
and
he's
not
instantly
available.
you
can...
he's
bound
to
get
notice.
his
office
will
make
sure
that
he
gets
notice.
but
he's
still
a
long
distance
away.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
difference...
what
difference
where
he's
got
his
office
make
if
all
he
has
in
his
office
is
somebody
to
notify
him
that
he's
got
some
mail
or
a
phone
call?
unknown
speaker
it
demonstrates
a
serious
commitment
to
practice
in
that
district,
i
take
it,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
a
serious
commitment
to
continuing
practice
in
that
district,
as
opposed
to
someone
who
just
practices
now
and
then
and
comes
in
pro
hac
vice?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
what
do
you...
i
notice
if
you
ever
go
up
to
wilmington,
delaware,
and
lawyers...
you
see
all
these
plaques
on
there,
and
that's
all
it
is.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
0
xxx.
unknown
speaker
xxx
if
there
is
one--
unknown
speaker
--was
the
fifth
circuit--
unknown
speaker
--were
they
thinking
about
requiring
particular
kind
of
a
rule
through
the
circuit?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
that
to
mean
he
would
satisfy
it
if
one
of
his
client's
were
willing
to
put
his
name
on
the
door
and
forward
mail
and
phone
calls
to
him?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is,
yes,
that
would
be
adequate?
unknown
speaker
so
maybe
he
needs
to
get
a
new
orleans
client.
unknown
speaker
maybe
he
needs
to
get
a
new
orleans
client?
you
think
it
says
that?
i
don't
think
it
says
that.
unknown
speaker
that
may
well
mean
that
you
just
can't
hire
an
office
and
have
a
vacant
office
with
nobody
there
to
answer
the
phone.
that's
how
i
would
have
interpreted
that.
