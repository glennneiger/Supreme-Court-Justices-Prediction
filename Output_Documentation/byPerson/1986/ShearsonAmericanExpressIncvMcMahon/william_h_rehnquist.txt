mr.
krebsbach,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
krebsbach.
mr.
krebsbach,
you
may
resume
where
you
left
off.
chief

rehnquist
these
procedures
now
enable
an
arbitration
to
last
as
long
as
a
lawsuit?

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
krebsbach.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,

taranto.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
eppenstein.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
don't
you
think,
as
has
been
suggested
by
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench,
that
that
really
is
another
question?
if
the
second
circuit
had
said
this
particular
agreement
didn't
give
enough
notice
to
the
customer
to
be
fair
and
binding,
you
know,
very
likely
we
wouldn't
have
granted
certiorari.
what
they
said
is,
arbitration,
no
matter
how
fair
or
under
what
kind
of
an
arbitration
agreement,
cannot
be
had
in
this
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
want
to
spend
your
30
minutes
arguing
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
eppenstein.
mr.
krebsbach,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
