justice
o'connor
what
requirements
have
been
placed
by
the
sec
on
your
arbitration
proceedings
if
they
were
to
go
forward?
justice
o'connor
and
how
are
the
arbitrators
selected
under
those
regulations?
justice
o'connor
does
the
claimant
get
to
select
an
arbitrator?
justice
o'connor
that
was
my
question
also.
justice
o'connor
has
there
been
a
significant
increase
in
claims
against
people
affected
by
this,
members
of
the
exchange
since
wilko
was
decided?
justice
o'connor
but
isn't
that
inherent
in
the
system
of
arbitration
and
congress
surely
knew
that
and
understood
it
when
congress
chose
to
enact
the
arbitration
law,
which
said
we
will
give
effect
to
contracts
to
arbitrate?
now,
if
you
have
a
claim
that
in
a
particular
contract
one
of
the
parties
didn't
understand
it
or
has...
or
that
it
is
a
contract
of
adhesion,
or
there
is
some
reason
to
get
out
of
it,
that
is
a
defense
to
the
contract
itself,
a
defense
that
says
there
wasn't
a
binding
contract
on
this,
but
once
you
agree
that
there
isn't
a
binding
contract,
and
i
guess
we
have
to
assume
that
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case,
then
we
have
to
look
to
what
congress
intended,
don't
we?
justice
o'connor
should
we
not
assume
it
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
the
effect
of
the
arbitration
act
on
the
securities
exchange
act?
justice
o'connor
shouldn't
we
do
it
just
for
that
purpose?
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
the
solicitor
general
makes
the
argument
on
behalf
of
the
sec
that
the
antiwaiver
provision
extends
only
to
substantive
provisions
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
justice
o'connor
is
there
any
legislative
history
specifically
that
would
guide
us
on
the
intention
of
the
antiwaiver
provision
that
has
come
to
your
attention?
