mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
agrees
with
petitioners
that
the
arbitration
agreement
at
issue
in
this
case
should
be
enforced.
our
argument
is
in
three
steps.
first,
the
agreement
at
issue
is
a
valid
contract,
and
the
federal
arbitration
act
requires
that
it
be
enforced
unless
that
act
is
superseded
by
another
federal
statute.
second,
the
antiwaiver
provision
of
the
securities
exchange
act,
which
is
alleged
to
be
the
superseding
statute,
only
invalidates
waivers
of
the
substantive
protections
of
the
securities
laws.
third,
there
is
no
waiver
of
substantive
protection
where
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
for
violations
of
the
act,
and
arbitration
is
an
adequate
remedy
when
it
takes
place
in
a
forum
that
is
subject
to
the
sec's
regulatory
oversight.
the
contract
in
this
case
provides
for
arbitration
in
such
a
forum,
and
should
therefore
be
enforced.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
the
sec
has
no
position
on
the
rico
claims--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
sec
has
no
supervisory
or
enforcement
responsibilities
specifically
for
rico.
our
argument--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
right.
the
sec
has
changed
its
position.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
they
have
seen
this
particular
light
this
time.
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
the
sec
took
a
different
position
in
a
third
circuit
case
in
1975.
our
argument
today
begins
with
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
if
overruling
means
that
under
the
current
statute
which
is
different
from
the
statute
as
it
existed
in
1953,
the
results
should
be
different,
yes,
we
do
think
that
wilko
should
be
overruled.
that
is
not
strictly
speaking
necessary
for
a
decision
in
this
case,
but--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
right,
the
rationale
we
advance
would--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
right.
we
read
the
antiwaiver
provisions
of
both
of
those
acts
to
be
concerned
with
waivers
of
substantive
protections.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
and
as
long--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
in
1953
the
securities
laws
were
not
what
they
are
today.
in
particular--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--there
could
have
been
no
argument
at
the
time
that
the
sec
had
a
clear
oversight
authority
over
self-regulating
agencies.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
that's
right,
but
there
might
have
been
a
different
assessment
about
the
adequacy
of
arbitration
to
enforce
substantive
protections.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that
is
right,
although
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--absolutely,
although
i
believe
that
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
in
wilko
itself
did
give
the
customer
a
right
to
go
to
an
sro
it's
just
that
the
authority
that
the
sec
now
has
over
sro
arbitrations
did
not
exist
at
the
time.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
less
in
terms
of
numbers
at
cases,
i
am
not
sure.
i
would
expect
that--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
believe
that
that
is
part
of
it.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
would
expect
that...
i
guess
i
am
again
not
sure
of
the
numbers.
certainly
most
securities
law
claims
are
10(b),
involve
some
kind
of
10(b)
claim.
on
the
other
hand,
the
arbitration
agreements
that
members
of
stock
exchanges
are,
as
far
as
i
know,
typically
use
do
in
fact
lead
to
an
sro
arbitration.
in
short,
i
am
not
sure
how
the
numbers
would
actually
work
out--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
that
there
has.
there
has
been...
as
far
as
i
know
that
increase
is
commensurate
with
the
general
increase
in
litigation
in
the
federal
courts.
i
believe
there
are
extensive
statistics
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
detail
the
increase
in
claims
both
in
the
federal
courts
and
in
arbitrations.
if
one
begins
with
the
arbitration
act
and
its
command
that
arbitration
agreements
be
enforced
the
question
then
becomes
whether
there
is
some
overriding
federal
statute,
and
the
only
statutory
provision
that
is
alleged
to
furnish
that
kind
of
overriding
command
is
the
antiwaiver
provision
of
the
exchange
act.
now,
as
i
have
suggested,
that
provision
does
not
concern
itself
with
all
waivers
of
procedural
rights
or
rights
to
particular
forums,
because
any
such
reading
would
presumably
invalidate
settlements
of
lawsuits,
post-dispute
arbitration
agreements,
and
even
predispute
arbitration
agreements
in
the
international
context
which
this
court
approved
in
scherk.
rather,
the
concern
of
that
provision
is
with,
as
its
language
concerning
compliance
suggests,
is
with
the
substantive
protections
of
the
acts,
of
the
securities
laws.
if
a
customer
waived
any
adequate
remedy
for
violations
of
the
act
that
would
be
prohibited
by
the
antiwaiver
provision.
but
where
a
customer
agrees
to
arbitrate
any
future
disputes
and
the
arbitral
forum
is
an
adequate
remedy
for
valid
complaints,
there
has
been
no
waiver
of
compliance
with
the
duties
under
the
act.
that
is
precisely
what
we
believe
to
be
the
case
with
agreements
to
arbitrate
under
a
self-regulatory
organization,
and
there
are
two
reasons.
one
of
them
is
that
this
court
in
numerous
cases
in
recent
years
has
come
to
a
quite
different
assessment
of
the
adequacy
of
arbitration
in
the
commercial
area
generally.
in
mitsubishi,
southland,
the
byrd
case,
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
in
general
no
good
reason
to
question
the
adequacy
of
arbitration
as
an
effective
remedy
for
resolving
commercial
disputes.
but
there
is
also
a
second
point,
and
that
second
reason
has
to
do
with
the
limitation
of
our
argument
to
arbitrations
that
take
place
under
the
sro.
the
sec
since
1975
has
had
a
very
broad
authority
to
review
the
rules
that
govern
arbitrations
under
sros
and
to
modify
them
where
appropriate.
it
is
that
authority
which
led
to
the
uniform
code
of
arbitration,
and
that
authority
can
be
used
in
the
future
to
effect
further
improvements
as
the
need
becomes
apparent.
that
oversight
authority,
which
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
wilko,
we
think
should
lead
to
a
different
assessment
of
the
adequacy
of
arbitration
because
it
in
effect
provides
a
statutory
basis
for
assuring
the
adequacy
of
that
remedy.
that
difference
means
the
factual
underpinning
of
wilko
is
no
longer
appropriate
today.
we
think
therefore
that
an
agreement
providing
for
sro
arbitration
does
not
waive
the
protections
of
the
securities
laws,
and
that
for
such
an
agreement
there
is
today
no
basis
in
the
exchange
act
for
overriding
the
command
of
the
arbitration
act.
we
therefore
think
that
insofar
as
the
judgment
below
concerns
a
securities
law
claim,
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
