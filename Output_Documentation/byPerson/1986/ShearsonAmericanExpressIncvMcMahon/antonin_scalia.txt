justice
scalia
i'm
sorry--
justice
scalia
--what
does
that
mean,
it
is
inapplicable
today,
if
you
don't
overrule
it?
justice
scalia
what
does
that
mean?
that
means
we
should
overrule
it.
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
what
if
you
have
arbitration
before
some
other
organization?
the
federal
arbitration
act
doesn't
just
apply
to
arbitration
before
these
organizations,
does
it?
justice
scalia
so
what
if
somebody
comes
in
with
you
know,
an
arbitration
agreement
before
some
unheard
of
and
not
necessarily
first
rate
organization?
would
you
want
us
to
continue
to
apply
wilko
in
that
case?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
in
wilko
we
said
it
did,
and
we
said
the
reason
was
that
we
weren't
sure
that
arbitration
could
preserve
the
rights.
you
are
now
telling
us
it
is
now
clear
that
arbitration
can
preserve
the
rights,
but
i
am
saying
that
isn't
clear.
it
is
just
clear
with
respect
to
some
of
these
organizations
that
you
are
telling
us
about,
but
what
if
the
arbitration
is
conducted
before
some
other
organization?
justice
scalia
i
understand,
but
the
first
question
whether
it
is
arbitrable
at
all
or
not
is
not
the
point
that
you
were
raising.
justice
scalia
you
were
raising
the
point
that
we
should
change
our
view
in
wilko
because
arbitration
is
now
better
than
it
used
to
be.
but
the
only
evidence
you
are
bringing
out
to
prove
that
is
certain
arbitration
organizations,
which
are
admittedly
good
ones,
but
they
are
not
all
arbitration.
so
therefore
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
wilko
entirely
or
just
overrule
wilko
when
these
stock
exchange
arbitration
procedures
are
involved?
justice
scalia
you
are
not
really
urging
an
overruling
of
wilko
entirely.
presumably
we
would
continue
to
apply
wilko
where
the
arbitration
was
not
provided
to
be
before
one
of
these
arbitration
institutions
that
are
within
the
control
of
the
sec.
justice
scalia
so
there
would
be
something
left
to
wilko.
justice
scalia
i
understand.
which
approach
leaves
less
of
wilko,
your
approach
or
the
approach
that
the
petitioner
takes
here?
justice
scalia
the
petitioners'
approach
as
i
understand
it
would
eliminate
any
application
of
wilko
to
10(b).
but
full
application
to
12-2
would
continue,
right?
justice
scalia
yours
would
leave
it
applicable
to
both
12
and
10(b),
arguably
10(b),
anyway,
although
we
would
have
to
decide
the
point,
i
presume,
but
it
would
only
be
applicable
to
them
where
you
are
not
using
an
sro,
right?
justice
scalia
now,
which
one
of
those
two
would
leave
more
of
this
litigation
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
sophistication
is
damaging?
that
means
the
rights
wouldn't
be
sufficiently
preserved
if
we
allowed
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
and
allowed
it
to
be
tried
to
a
district
judge
unless
we
have
unsophisticated
district
judges?
justice
scalia
we
would
say
that
is
okay
sophistication
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
right?
justice
scalia
if
the
parties
want
to
go
for
sophistication,
so
if
they
sign
this
agreement
and
they
are
willing
to
go
for
a
sophisticated
panel,
it
is
all
right
then.
justice
scalia
that
is
a
different
argument.
justice
scalia
no,
but
justice
o'connor's
point
is
that
the
composition
of
the
arbitration
panels
in
these
sros
is
not
much
different
from
the
ordinary
arbitration
panel.
when
congress
was
thinking
of
arbitration
it
was
not...
it
was
probably
thinking
of
the
ordinary
case
where
one
side
picks
one
sophisticated
person,
the
other
side
picks
another
sophisticated
person,
and
the
two
of
them
get
together
and
pick
a
third
sophisticated
person.
nobody
picks
somebody
off
the
street
the
way
we
select
juries.
justice
scalia
but
isn't
that
what
congress
had
in
mind,
justice
o'connor
was
asking,
when
they
were
talking
about
arbitration?
they
were
talking
about
just
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
scalia
well,
you
have
established
that
they
were
either
wrong
then
or
they
are
wrong
now.
do
you
want
to
tell
us
why
they
are
wrong
now
instead
of
then?
justice
scalia
that
really
doesn't
go
to
the
basis
of
our
decision.
our
decision...
it
goes
more
to
your
concern
about
proper
notice
to
the
customer.
and
our
decision
wasn't
based
on
that,
it
was
based
on
the
fact
that
arbitration,
no
matter
how
good
the
notice
you
gave
may
have
been,
arbitration
cannot
serve
to
give
the
kind
of
justice
that
is
needed
under
this
act.
now,
maybe
the
sec
continues
to
take
the
same
view
as
to
whether
these
particular
forms
give
the
customer
enough
notice
about
what
he
is
letting
himself
in
for.
but
that
is
not
really
what
we
have
before
us.
we
just
have
before
us
the
question
whether,
assuming
adequate
notice
is
given,
and
you
can
fight
that
out
some
other
day,
is
arbitration
a
proper
way
to
get
these
matters
settled?
justice
scalia
volume
decrease,
or
just
the
percentage?
i
mean,
the
percentage
could--
justice
scalia
--volume.
justice
scalia
a
billion
dollars
here,
a
billion
dollars
there,
pretty
soon
it
adds
up
to
real
money.
justice
scalia
and
the
individuals
who
have
large
claims,
you
say.
you
are
not
worried
about
those
that
have,
what,
$10,000
claims
are
presumably
not
very
unsophisticated
individuals
either.
justice
scalia
can
we
take
judicial
notice
of
that?

[generallaughter.]
justice
scalia
it
is
not
their
view
of
the
law
that
they
are
talking
about,
it
is
the
court's
view
of
the
law,
as
i
understand
the
rule.
justice
scalia
what
they
are
saying
is
that
given
wilko,
this
statement
is
misleading.
but
if
wilko
were
to
be
changed,
this
statement
wouldn't
be
misleading.
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
scalia
and
therefore
the
rule
is
correct
as
it
now
stands.
therefore
the
rule
is
misleading.
