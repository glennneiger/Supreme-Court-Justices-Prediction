justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
justice
stevens
who
did
create
the
10(b)(5)
private
cause
of
action?
justice
stevens
they
held
that
congress
intended
such
a
cause
of
action?
justice
stevens
so
that
although
it
isn't
expressed
the
source
of
the
cause
of
action
is
nevertheless
the
statute.
justice
stevens
i
though
you
said
the
courts
interpreted
the
legislation
as
indicating
that
congress
impliedly
intended
it.
justice
stevens
so
what
is
the
ultimate
source
of
the
cause
of
action?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
thing?
is
it
your
position
that...
i
think
the
logic
of
your
argument
suggests
that
you
would
overrule...
you
think
we
should
overrule
wilko.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
argument.
justice
stevens
so
both
'33
act
and
'34
act
claims
would
be
subject
to
arbitration.
justice
stevens
substantive,
right.
justice
stevens
and
really
you
are
saying
it
was
incorrectly
decided
in
the
first
instance,
too,
i
take
it--
justice
stevens
--i
understand,
but
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
under
the
different
statutory
language
then,
i
think.
justice
stevens
no,
i
understand,
but
the
substantive
argument,
the
point
about
only
substantive
protections
of
the
act
are
not
waivable.
justice
stevens
so
that
would
have
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
justice
stevens
mr.
eppenstein,
while
you
are
interrupted,
may
i
back
up
and
ask
a
factual
question
that
has
come
to
mind
as
a
result
of
justice
blackmun's
question
about
rule
15(c)(2),
which
i
guess
was
promulgated
in
1983?
your
agreements
were
signed
in
'80
and
'82,
so
they
preceded
that
rule,
but
is
it
the
fact
that,
a,
that
rule
remains
in
effect
as
i
guess
you
indicated,
and
b,
does
that
mean
there
are
no
such
agreements,
no
agreements
like
the
one
in
this
case
that
have
been
executed
after
'83
if
they
would
have
been
in
violation--
justice
stevens
--under
your
reading
of
that
rule,
of
course,
we
don't
have
the
whole
text
of
it
in
front
of
us,
would
the
agreement
that
your
client
signed
have
been
prohibited
if
it
had
been
executed
after
1983?
justice
stevens
and
it
is
your
contention
that
the
commission's
position
in
this
case
is
not
merely
that
they
have
changed
their
view,
but
that
the
rule
they
promulgated
in
'83
probably
is
an
invalid
rule.
if
you
buy
their
argument
completely,
that
is
what
they
are
now
contending,
their
own
rule
is
invalid.
justice
stevens
you
mean
because
they
had
all
that
money,
an
individual
could
not
have
said,
i
won't
sign
this
agreement?
justice
stevens
he
could
have
said,
i
won't
sign
it.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
fact
they
had
$400
million
didn't
make
them
sign
that
agreement.
i
don't
find
that
argument
very
persuasive.
an
individual
can
still
say,
i
don't
like
this
agreement
and
i
won't
sign
it.
justice
stevens
well,
but
that
law,
that
rule
is
still
in
effect.
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
you
say
it
doesn't...
the
language
of
the
rule
is
correct,
it
just
means
something
else?
i
don't
understand
you.
it
says
it
is
a
misleading
statement
of
the
customer's
rights
to
include
this
kind
of
provision
in
the--
justice
stevens
--does
it
says
in
the
rule
itself
under
our
present
view
of
the
law
it
would
be
misleading
but
if
we
change
our
mind
it
will
no
longer
be
misleading?
justice
stevens
but
that
is
in
effect
what
you
think
it
was
meant
to
say?
