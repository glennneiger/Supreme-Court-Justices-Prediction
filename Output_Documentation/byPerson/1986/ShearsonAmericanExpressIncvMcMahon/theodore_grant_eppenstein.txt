mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court,
i
am
here
representing
the
respondents
in
this
case,
eugene
mcmahon,
julia
mcmahon,
and
the
four
pension
trusts.
i
am
also
here
representing
all
of
the
other
individual
investors
who
have
pre-dispute
arbitration
agreements
in
place.
the
concerns
that
they
have
are
the
same
concerns
that
are
placed
before
this
court,
and
that
is
namely
that
the
pre-dispute
arbitration
agreement
be
found
to
be
unenforceable
in
two
contexts,
one,
in
connection
with
section
10,
and
two,
in
connection
with
rico
claims.
we
have
heard
earlier
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
about
the
fact
that
arbitration
at
the
sros
is
something
that
the
government
now
considers
to
be
okay.
they
didn't
before.
of
course,
the
securities
industry
always
felt
that
arbitration
is
beneficial.
however,
what
is
the
reason
that
we
have
the
securities
industry
coming
into
this
court
and
coming
into
almost
every
other
district
court
and
circuit
court
in
this
country
trying
to
get
everything
into
arbitration?
i
think
it
is
simple.
the
reason
is,
they
feel
they
have
a
leg
up
when
they
go
to
arbitration
and
the
reason
for
that
mainly
is
because
they
have
a
member
of
their
industry
sitting
on
each
panel,
typically
there
are
three
members
on
an
arbitration
panel,
we
feel
if
one
member
is
represented
by
the
securities
industry
the
public
customer
is
at
a
disadvantage
from
the
start.
now,
mr.
krebsbach
mentioned
that
there
are
peremptory
challenges
available
in
arbitration,
i
propose
to
you
according
to
the
uniform
act
there
is
one.
furthermore,
mr.
krebsbach
stated
that
there
were
members
of
the
public
who
sit
as
other
members
on
the
panel.
i
present
to
you
the
people
who
sit
who
are
not
industry
members
are
sophisticated
businessmen.
i
have
looked
at
the
panel
list
of
the
american
stock
exchange,
which
is
included
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
and
i
note
that
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
are
securities
litigators,
but
those
people
come
from
the
large
firms,
the
firms
who
typically
represent
the
brokerage
companies.
i
think
having
the
public
customer
believes
that
having
an
industry
representative
on
the
panel
is
very
damaging.
we
believe
that--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--no,
justice
scalia.
if
there
was
a
situation
where
the
parties
agreed
to
waive
a
jury
trial
and
go
before
a
judge
that
would
be
fine.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
well,
i
am
saying...
i
am
saying
that
when
they
signed
this
agreement
they
didn't
know
what
they
were
agreeing
to.
they
didn't
know
that
they
were
agreeing
to
have
all
their
grievances,
no
matter
how
terrible
they
may
be,
under
section
10(b)
or
under
rico
sent
to
arbitration.
they
are
not
aware
of
that.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
it
is.
i
feel
that
the
non-industry
members
on
the
arbitration
panel
are
not
drawn
from
the
general
public
as
mr.
krebsbach
argued.
they
are
not
drawn
from
a
pool
of
the
community
as
we
have
in
federal
court,
people
who
sit
on
the
jury.
they
are
drawn
from
businessmen.
they
are
drawn
from
people
who
are
typically
knowledgeable
about
the
workings
of
the
marketplace.
they
are
not
the
type
of
individual
who
comes
into
federal
court
with
a
section
10(b)
claim
alleging
to
be
an
unsophisticated
investor.
i
think
we
have
a
disparity
there.
i
don't
think
it
is
as
great
as
the
bias
of
having
an
industry
member
sit
on
the
panel.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
i
would
like
to
answer
that
first
with
your
latter
premise.
i
wouldn't
assume
that
there
is
a
binding
contract
in
this
case.
the
point
was
raised
down
below
and
it
was
litigated
and
the
record
has
affidavits
in
it
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
it
is
an
unenforceable
contract--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--if
we
assume
that
it
is--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--sure.
if
we
assume
that
it
is
a
good
contract,
your
honor,
we
believe
the
arbitration
act,
which
was
devised
in
1925,
did
not
take
into
account
the
fact
that
an
arbitration
panel
may
be
composed
of
panel
members
as
we
find
now
in
the
sros.
we
are
bound...
if
we
take
this
contract
as
binding,
we
are
bound
to
go
to
either
the
american
stock
exchange,
the
nasd,
or
the
new
york
stock
exchange
with
all
our
claims,
nowhere
else.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
true,
but
we
don't
have
that
here,
do
we,
justice
scalia?
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
i
think
the
response
is
yes,
congress
did
probably
have
that
in
mind.
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
we
don't
have
that
here,
and
also,
we
have
to
look
at
the
1934
act
and
its
purposes
to
determine
what
the
tension
is
between
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
'34
act.
and
i
say,
and
it
has
been
found
by
eight
circuit
courts,
who
have
followed
the
second
circuit
reasoning
here,
that
there
is
a
great
protective
policy
written
into
the
federal
securities
laws,
and
i
am
not
just
talking
about
the
'34
act.
i
am
talking
about
the
'33
act
also.
and
in
order
to
pursue
that
protective
policy
congress
created
an
antiwaiver
provision
in
section
29a
of
the
'34
act
which
we
put
forth
is
something
that
requires
that
this
case
and
the
claims
in
this
case
not
be
sent
to
arbitration,
there
is
a
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
section
27.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
we
disagree.
we
believe...
the
only
way
the
antiwaiver
provision
makes
any
sense
is
if
it
pertains
to
the
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction.
an
antiwaiver
provision
in
my
mind
is
something
that
isn't
passed
very
often
in
many
acts,
and
it
was
particularly
passed
in
both
the
'33
act
and
the
'34
act.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
i
believe
we
have
to
look
at
the
act
itself
and
if
we
can't
find
the
answer
in
the
act
itself
then
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
legislature
has
done,
and
i
can
run
down
for
you,
justice
o'connor,
what
has
occurred
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
'34
act,
and
i
think
we
have
our
answer
there.
in
1975
the
'34
act
was
extensively
revised,
and
in
that
revision
there
were
several
instances
in
which
congress
amended
section
28,
for
example,
which
gave
the
rights
of
members
of
the
securities
industries
to
have
arbitrations
between
themselves.
so
what
congress
did
there
was,
they
carved
out
an
exception
to
what
they
perceived
to
be
the
rule
of
nonarbitrability.
otherwise
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
pass
that
amendment
to
section
28.
furthermore,
congress
enacted
in
1975
the
municipal
rulemaking
board,
and
as
part
of
that
section
which
is
section
15...
well,
it
is
found
within
section
15,
your
honor.
it
is
a
subdivision
of
it.
that
section
specifically
provided
for
an
individual
to
bring
an
arbitration
in
connection
with
a
municipal
security
dispute.
however,
congress
stated
in
particular
that
section
29(a)
should
be
abided
by
in
all
respects,
which
means
you
cannot
enforce
a
pre-dispute
arbitration
agreement
in
connection
with
municipal
securities.
again,
this
is
an
exception
that
congress
would
not
have
had
to
make
if
they
didn't
believe
the
unenforceability
of
the
provisions
of
the
'34
act.
getting
back
to
arbitration
for
a
second,
since
the
government
has
stepped
in
here
and
taken
some
of
us
for
a
loop
and
come
forward
on
behalf
of
the
securities
industry,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
marked
departure
from
their
previous
positions.
in
1979...
actually
our
brief
goes
back
to
1953
where
they
started
criticizing
the
usage
of
the
so-called
pre-dispute
arbitration
provision
that
we
find
in
the
mcmahon
case.
we
have
had
an
exchange
act
release
that
the
government
has
promulgated
in
1979,
and
it
is
release
15984,
which
criticized
the
use
of
that
provision.
they
found
that
the
pre-dispute
provision
was
something
that
was
confusing,
it
was
something
that
was
not
fully
disclosing
the
situation
to
the
public
customer,
and
it
was
something
that
they
frowned
upon.
in
1983
they
went
a
step
further
by
promulgating
release
20397.
in
that
release
they
said,
well,
the
security
industry
hasn't
been
listening
to
us,
so
we
are
not
going
to
promulgate
a
rule,
and
they
promulgated
rule
15c2-2
which
made
it
a
violation
for
the
brokerage
industries
to
contain
a
pre-dispute
arbitration
clause
in
their
customer
contracts.
and
the
reasons
that
they
came
out
with
that
is
because
they
felt
it
was
misleading.
they
felt
that
the
public
customer
was
not
being
protected
as
he
should
be
under
the
1934
acts.
in
fact--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--as
far
as
i
know
it
is
still
on
the
books.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
justice
blackmun,
the
government
seems
to
want
to
repeal
it
by
filing
their
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
but
i
haven't
seen
anything
other
than
that.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
getting
back
to
rule
15c2-2
for
a
second--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--they
are
wrong
now
because
of
the
purposes
behind
the
federal
securities
statutes
and
that
is
to
protect
the
public
customer
from
abuses
in
the
marketplace.
for
years
dating
back
to
the
early
fifties
they
took
the
position
that
this
was
an
abuse.
in
fact,
the
said
in
these
releases
that
the
mere
printing
of
the
form
is
in
and
of
itself
a
section
10
violation.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
we
don't
believe
it
is,
and
i
started
giving
the
number
one
reason,
and
that
is
having
the
industry
representative
appear
on
the
panel
of
the
sros.
additionally,
of
course,
you
lose
your
federal
procedural
protections
to
broad
discovery,
which
is
of
extreme
importance
in
a
securities
fraud
case
where
the
brokerage
firm
is
in
possession
of
all
of
the
documents
and
the
customer
is
not.
the
right
to
judicial
review
is
severely
limited
in
arbitration,
and
since
the
arbitrators
are
told
not
to
give
reasons
for
their
awards,
it
is
very
unlikely
that
someone
can
go
into
court
and
say,
well,
they
had
manifest
disregard
for
the
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
president
of
the
american
arbitration
association
has
been
quoted
as
saying
don't
write
reasons
that
can't
be
criticized.
again,
i
believe
that
if
we
look
to
the
other
rights
that
a
customer
is
entitled
to
when
he
goes
to
court
and
examine
what
he
loses
when
he
goes
to
arbitration,
in
the
context
of
the
federal
securities
laws
and
the
rico
statute
we
believe
that
a
customer
is
not
fully
protected.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
arbitration
is
inappropriate
in
every
case,
nor
am
i
suggesting
that
you
find
that
arbitration
is
no
good
at
all
for
securities
cases,
because
i
find
in
the
uniform
act
that
arbitration
will
be
something
that
a
customer
might
want
to
utilize
for
a
small
claim
of
$2,500
or
$5,000
where
he
can't
hire
a
lawyer
to
help
him,
where
there
are
simplified
procedures
under
the
uniform
act
in
order
to
have
this
thing
figured
out
by
letters
coming
back
and
forth
by
the
claimant
and
the
brokerage
firm
has
some
purpose
there.
but
for
the
big
case,
justice
scalia,
the
10(b)
cases,
it
really
has
no
useful
purpose,
and
we
believe
the
customer
is
behind
the
eight-ball
when
he
goes
into
arbitration.
now,
this
court
has
balanced
the
tension
between
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
other
federal
statutes
before.
we
discussed
wilko
versus
swann
in
1953.
and
then
we
have
mcdonald
in
1984,
barrentine
in
1981,
and
alexander
in
1974.
in
those
cases,
this
court
found
that
the
claimant
was
entitled
to
a
federal
forum,
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
gone
through
arbitration.
a
point
that
was
brought
out,
if
i
may
refer
to
the
form
of
customer
agreements
that
we
have
in
this
case,
which,
as
i
said
before,
the
sec
has
found
for
some
30
years
to
be
an
improper
notification
to
the
customer,
the
customer
who
comes
into
the
brokerage
relationship
is
coming
in
thinking
that
the
broker
is
going
to
make
money
for
him.
otherwise
he
wouldn't
go
there
in
the
first
place.
he
is
at
a
position
where
he
is
trusting
the
broker
with
his
dollars
or
her
dollars,
as
the
case
may
be.
the
customer,
unsophisticated
as
he
may
be,
isn't
aware
that
he
has
to
read
the
customer
agreement
with
a
fine
tooth
comb.
the
agreement
that
we
have
in
front
of
us
is
a
multipage
document.
somewhere
found
on
the
second
page
in
the
middle
of
paragraph
13,
which
starts,
by
the
way,
stating
that
this
agreement
shall
innure
to
the
benefit
of
your
heirs
and
assigns,
we
find
the
sentence
which
states
that
all
grievances
are
going
to
be
decided
in
arbitration.
well,
if
you
were
to
uphold
that,
i
think
you
have
to
say
to
the
customer,
you
had
better
get
a
lawyer
in
order
to
open
up
a
brokerage
account,
in
order
to
review
that
agreement.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
no,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that,
your
honor.
i
pointed
it
out
to
the
court
because
i
think--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
point
it
out
to
the
court
because
i
think
that
the
sec
was
right
for
those
30
years
when
they
found
that
this
was
not
full
disclosure
to
the
customer.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
your
honor,
this
court
can
put
aside
this
portion
of
my
argument
and
rule
in
favor
of
the
second
circuit's
opinion
down
the
line
and
i
would
be
perfectly
happy.
what
concerns
me
is
this
practice
which
no
one
is
doing
anything
about.
we
have--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--no,
i
didn't
mean
to
do
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
moving
on
to
what
congress
has
done
about
this
situation
that
i
termed
unfair
to
the
customer
when
he
is
forced
to
go
into
arbitration,
i
believe
just
today
there
was
a
letter
distributed
from
chairman
john
dingell
which
was
sent
to
chairman
shadd
at
the
sec.
and
in
congressman
dingell's
letter,
dated
february
11,
1987,
is
stated
that
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest
that
congress
perceives
in
this
type
of
arrangement
where
there
is
a
broker
sitting
on
the
panel.
congressman
dingell
goes
on
to
cite
the
admission
of
the
sec
of
limited
authority
that
they
have
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
federal
securities
laws
are
correctly
applied
in
arbitration.
and
lastly,
if
you
will
permit
me,
i
would
just
like
to
quote
you
one
portion
of
that
letter
which
appears
on
page
3
and
which
congressman
dingell
sought
to
underscore
on
his
own,
and
here
he
quotes
from
an
august,
1986,
report
of
the
staff
of
division
and
marketing
of
the
sec,
who
said,
"the
commission
has
no
authority
to
review
a
specific
arbitration
to
assure
either
compliance
with
procedural
requirements
of
the
code.
"
the
uniform
code
of
arbitration,
"or
accurate
interpretations
of
underlying
federal
securities
law
or
other
claims
by
the
arbitrators.
"
"the
commission
has
no
authority
to
overturn
an
arbitration
award.
"
well,
then,
what
is
the
government
telling
us
they
are
doing?
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
your
honor,
this
was
a--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
if
you
would
permit
us
to
make
a
supplemental
filing,
i
would
be
happy
to
add
it
to
the--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--we
have
made
provisions
with
the
clerk
of
this
court--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--i
would
respectfully
request
that
congressman
dingell's...
the
import
of
congressman
dingell's
letter--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--i
am
sure
you
are.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
i
wish
that
were
so,
justice
stevens.
unfortunately,
we
still
find
that
they
are
prevalent
in
the
industry,
especially
for
margin
agreements.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
yes,
we
believe
so.
we
believe
that
that
rule
states
it
would
have
been
in
itself
a
violation
of
section
10(b)
for
the
brokerage
firm
to
give
that
form
of
agreement
to
the
customer
without
a
legend
that
says
you
have
the
right
to
go
to
federal
court
to
sue
on
your
federal
security
claims
despite
what
is
contained
in
this
agreement.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
i
think
they
are
fighting
an
inconsistent
position
without
any
justification
for
doing
it.
i
mean,
in
essence
their
argument
is,
because
we
have
oversight
authority
it
has
to
be
right
because
congress
gave
us
this
right
in
1975,
then
the
arbitration
procedure
is
fair.
however,
all
of
these
rules,
the
rule
15(c)(2)-2
and
each
of
the
releases
came
after
congress
gave
them
the
power.
additionally,
they
had
the
uniform
code
of
arbitration
in
front
of
them,
and
they
still
came
out
with
these
rules
and
these
releases.
another
issue
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
which
the
securities
industry
has
brought
up
in
their
amicus
brief
in
support
of
certiorari
is
the
table
that
they
append
in
connection
with
the
amount
of
cases
that
are
before
the
district
courts,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
statistics
can
be
read
in
many
ways.
the
way
i
read
these
statistics
is
that
for
each
of
the
five
years
that
the
sia
has
compiled
the
amount
of
cases
brought
under
all
of
the
securities
laws,
not
just
10(b),
but
the
'33
act,
the
'34
act,
and
the
commodities
act,
taking
all
of
those
cases
together,
they
amounted
to
less
than
2
percent
of
the
total
cases
in
the
federal
docket.
now,
they
did
not
go
into
the
most
recent
figures
of
1986,
which
i
did,
and
was
advised
that
in
fact
the
amount
of...
the
amount
of
cases
under
all
the
securities
laws
have
decreased
in
1986
to
a
point
beyond
the
1984
level,
again,
less
than
2
percent
of
all
the
cases
that
are
in
this
court.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
the
volume
decrease.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
unfortunately,
the
sia
didn't
break
out
the
amount
of
cases
that
were
just
under
10(b).
and
i
don't
have
those
figures,
either.
they
have
called--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--yes.
that
brings
up
a
point
about
the
equal
bargaining
rights
that
the
parties
have
when
they
go
into
a
contract
that
i
would
like
to
address
for
just
one
second.
i
know
i
don't
want
to
take
30
minutes
to
discuss
it,
but
here
we
have
a
firm
such
as
shearson
who
the
new
york
times
reported
last
week
had
revenues
of
$4.6
billion
and
income
of
$316
million,
and
they
are
saying
that
there
was
equal
bargaining
in
connection
with
the
standard,
so-called
standard
form
of
agreement.
i
don't
think
so,
and
i
think
this
is
what
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
as
an
overwhelming
bargaining
power
which
would
vitiate
a
contract.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
the
individual,
when
this
agreement
was
presented
to
him,
had
no
choice.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
because
it
was
common
practice
at
the
firms
to
have
this
type
of
agreement.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
i
would
then
say
that
there
is
no
room
for
them
to
go
elsewhere.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
that's
correct.
four
of
them
are
profit
and
pension
sharing
plans,
which
makes
the
facts
of
this
case
even
worse
if
we
get
to
them
some
day.
i
would
like--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--no,
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that.
i
would
say
that
there
might
be
decent
businessmen
if
they
have
a
decent
salary,
but
i
wouldn't
say
that
they
are
sophisticated
in
the
workings
of
the
marketplace.
i
mean,
it
is
common
knowledge,
for
example,
that
doctors
are
not.
0
[generallaughter.]
i
won't
imply
on
attorneys.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
no,
your
honor.
lastly,
i
would
say
with
respect
to
rico
we
have
the
same
concerns
that
we
have
in
connection
with
a
10(b)
claimant.
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
i
think,
justice
white,
you
will
have
to
look
at
the
statute
and
you
will
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
you
will
have
to
look
at
the
judicial
interpretations,
and
i
submit
that
over--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
theodore
grant
eppenstein
--yes,
i
believe
so,
but
i
think
that
the
antiwaiver
provision
in
this
case
governs
the
fact
that
they
are
not
to
be
enforced.
