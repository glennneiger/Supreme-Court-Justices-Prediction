mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
lower
courts
can
refuse
to
enforce
agreements
to
arbitrate
claims
under
section
10(b)
of
the
exchange
act
and
rico,
notwithstanding
the
clear
congressional
directive
in
the
arbitration
act
that
agreements
to
arbitrate
shall
be
valid,
irrevocable,
and
enforceable.
the
parties
in
this
case
contracted
to
arbitrate
all
of
their
disputes
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
respondent's
securities
accounts.
the
court
of
appeals
enforced
that
contract
with
respect
to
the
parties'
common
law
claims
but
refused
to
enforce
that
contract
with
respect
to
the
claims
pertaining
to
section
10(b)
and
rico,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
these
claims
arose
from
the
same
set
of
factual
allegations
pertaining
to
the
common
law
claims.
petitioners
are
here
today
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
and
ask
this
court
to
enforce
the
contract
of
the
parties
with
respect
to
all
of
their
disputes.
the
parties'
contracts
should
be
enforced
with
respect
to
10(b)
claims
because
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
an
exception
to
the
federal
arbitration
act
for
claims
under
section
10(b).
congress
enacted
the
exchange
act
in
1934,
just
nine
years
after
it
passed
the
arbitration
act
in
1925.
if
congress
had
intended
to
create
an
exception
to
the
arbitration
act,
section
10(b),
it
simply
had
to
state
within
the
statute
itself
that
such
an
exception
was
to
be
created
and
it
simply
could
have
prohibited
within
the
statute
itself
arbitration
of
10(b)
claims.
this
it
did
not
do,
and
for
this
reason
alone
it
is
clear
that
the
arbitration
act
contains
no
exception
for
10(b)
claims.
despite
the
congressional
silence
in
the
exchange
act,
the
exchange
act
does
contain
an
antiwaiver
provision
of
the
type
that
this
court
in
wilko
v.
swann
found
in
1953
prohibited
arbitration
of
section
12-2
claims
under
the
1933
securities
act.
section
14
of
that
act
voided
stipulations
binding
a
person
to
waive
compliance
with
a
provision
of
the
1903
securities
act.
the
wilko
court
held
that
because
of
the
unique
special
<twelve
two>
[=
12-2]
right
created
by
congress
in
the
securities
act,
which
was
substantially
different
from
common
law
fraud,
and
that
it
switched
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
plaintiff
buyer
to
the
seller
defendant
in
that
case,
as
well
as
because
of
the
wilko
court's
concerns
about
the
adequacy
of
the
arbitral
forum
to
enforce
the
special
right
and
the
adequacy
of
judicial
review
of
the
arbitrator's
decision.
the
wilko
court
as
a
result
of
this
analysis
of
section
14
to
prohibit
waiver
of
judicial
trial
and
review,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
nowhere
in
the
statute
or
its
legislative
history
did
congress
indicate
any
evidence
that
it
wanted
to
use
that
interpretation
of
an
antiwaiver
provision,
which
in
fact
was
quite
contrary
to
the
interpretation
of
an
antiwaiver
provision
at
common
law.
petitioners
believe
that
the
wilko
court's
interpretation
of
a
antiwaiver
provision
must
be
limited
to
section
12-2
of
the
securities
act
for
two
reasons.
first,
wilko's
interpretation
of
an
antiwaiver
provision
with
respect
to
congressional
intent
cannot
be
mechanically
applied
to
section
10(b)
claims
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
byrd
case
in
1985.
it
simply
cannot
be
said
that
for
an
implied,
judicially
implied
cause
of
action
such
as
10(b)
that
congress
intended
an
antiwaiver
provision
to
prohibit
judicial
trial
and
review
of
the
cause
of
action
that
it
itself
did
not
create.
second,
to
the
extent
that
the
wilko
courts--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
the
10(b)(5)
private
cause
of
action
was
judicially
implied
by
the
courts,
which
held
in
effect
that
congress
impliedly
intended
to
create
an--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
that
source
is
created
by
judicial
implication
and
was
not
expressly
created.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
the
action
itself
is
created
by
judicial
implication
but
the
reports
by
doing
that
were
saying
that
congress
intended
to
create--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--congressional
intent,
your
honor.
however,
petitioners
believe
that
to
take
it
one
step
further
would
be
illogical,
and
to
say
that
congress
intended
to
exempt
such
an
action
from
arbitration
when
it
did
not
create
that
cause
of
action
would
just
not
make
sense.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
however,
recently
in
a
number
of
decisions
this
court
has
stated,
most
recently
in
mitsubishi,
that
in
examining
whether
congress
intended
to
prohibit
a
certain
statute
from
the
arbitration
act,
you
must
look
to
the
congressional
intent
expressed
in
that
statute
or
its
legislative
history.
certainly
with
respect
to
implied
cause
of
action
it
cannot
be
said
that
congress
intended
to
create
an
exception
to
the
arbitration
act
when
it
did
not
expressly
create
that
statute.
certainly
when
congress
expressly
created
a
statute
and
then
evidenced
its
intent
in
the
statute
to
prohibit
arbitration
of
that
statute,
that
would
be
a
different
story.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
we
also
believe
that
the
wilko
court's
analysis
was
limited
to
the
unique
12-2
cause
of
action
which
the
wilko
court
termed
as
a
special
right.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
in
the
byrd
case.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
does
appear
that
the--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--well,
it
seems
from
an
analysis
of
those
cases
in
the
federal
courts,
your
honor,
that
after
the
wilko
decision
there
was
an
assumption
on
the
part
of
the
courts
that
the
wilko
doctrine
applied
to
10(b)
claims
simply
because
it
was
a
securities
act
claim.
however,
the
courts
that
have
examined
that
particular
concept
of
applying
the
wilko
analysis
in
12-2
to
section
10(b)
claims
since
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
byrd
case,
the
majority
of
those
courts
have
ruled
in
favor
of
petitioner
and
have
held
that
these
10(b)
claims
should
be
arbitrated.
the
second
reason
that
petitioners
feel
that
the
wilko
analysis
is
limited
to
section
12(b)
is
that
the
wilko
courts
paid
such
deference
to
the
special
right
in
section
12(b),
the
switching
of
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
seller.
the
wilko
court
felt
that
arbitrators
could
not
understand
the
legal
interpretations
of
the
statute
without
judicial
instruction
on
the
law.
certainly
they
also
felt
that
there
was
inadequate
judicial
review
under
the
arbitration
act
with
respect
to
section
12-2.
however,
as
the
wilko
court
pointed
out,
their
concerns
were
based
on
the
fact
that
section
12-2
is
substantially
different
from
common
law
fraud.
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
byrd,
the
10(b)
action,
while
different
from
common
law
fraud,
is
not
that
much
different
to
create
the
type
of
concerns
that
the
wilko
court
had
in
1953.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
notwithstanding
this
court's
ability
to
rule
in
petitioner's
favor
by
distinguishing
the
12-2
action
in
wilko
from
the
10(b)
action
in
this
case,
the
wilko
court's
concerns
in
1953
about
arbitration
in
general
can
no
longer
be
substantiated
and
wilko
is
inapplicable
today
for
that
very
reason
alone.
in
1975,
congress
enacted
section
19
of
the
exchange
act,
which
gave
the
sec
supervisory
authority--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--not
in
a
sense
to
overrule
it,
your
honor,
but
to
simply
acknowledge--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--it
is
inapplicable
today.
in
1975
congress
gave--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--excuse
me.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
what
we
are
saying
in
effect,
your
honor,
is
that
although
wilko
may
have
been
correctly
decided
in
1953,
the
concerns
of
the
wilko
court
are
no
longer
applicable
today,
so
that
wilko's
holding
should
no
longer
be
applicable.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
as
of
today,
yes.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
the
sec
was
given
authorization
by
congress
in
section
19
of
the
exchange
act
to
supervise
arbitration
procedures.
pursuant
to
that
jurisdiction
the
uniform
code
of
arbitration
was
adopted,
which
provide
rules
of
the
various
self-regulatory
organizations
such
as
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
the
american
stock
exchange,
and
the
nesd,
which
were
all
included
in
the
customer
agreement
in
the
case
before
the
court
today.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--in
the
first
instance,
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question,
in
an
examination
of
congressional
intent
we
do
not
believe
it
is
proper
to
get
into
that
question.
we
think
that
you
simply
look
at
the
statute
and
determine
as
to
that
statute
whether
congress
expressed
a
general
intention
to
prohibit
statutory
claims
under
that
statute
from
arbitration
or
it
did
not.
once
you
determine--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--certainly,
your
honor,
petitioners
feel
that
with
respect
to
sro
arbitration
under
the
sec's
jurisdiction
arbitration
is
certainly
proper
today
and
the
wilko
court's
concerns
are
alleviated.
to
answer
your
question,
however,
recent
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
the
court's
decision
in
mitsubishi,
seem
to
indicate
that
perhaps
a
different
test
is
being
used
today
with
respect
to
determining
arbitrability
of
statutory
disputes,
but
you
must
look
at
the
congressional
intent
contained
in
the
statute
or
its
legislative
history
and
in
the
first
instance
determine
whether
the
statute
is
arbitrable
at
all.
a
secondary
question
which
then
would
be
asked
is
whether
or
not
the
arbitration
forms
themselves
are
competent
once
the
court
has
determined
that
the
statutory
claims
under
that
statute
are
arbitrable.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
with
respect
to
that
particular
point
we
believe
that
wilko's
concerns
about
the
adequacy
of
arbitration
were
improper.
in
light
of
the
congressional
policy
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
which
clearly
created
a
strong
policy
favoring
arbitration,
we
believe
that
the
wilko
court's
concerns
with
respect
to
the
competency
of
arbitrators
in
general
were
improper.
with
respect
to
any
particular
forum
today
we
think
in
the
first
instance
the
court
should
determine
whether
the
statute
is
arbitrable.
we
think
under
the
act
congress
has
provided
bases
on
a
motion
to
vacate
or
a
motion
to
confirm
to
overturn
the
decision
of
an
arbitrator
if
the
arbitrator's
decision
is
improper.
it
does
not
seem
that
congress
is
saying
in
the
act
itself
that
there
is
any
reason
that
there
should
be
a
presumption
that
arbitrators
are
not
competent.
quite
to
the
contrary,
in
light
of
the
clear
policy
in
the
federal
arbitration
act,
its
seems
that
the
presumption
should
be
that
arbitrators
are
competent,
and
this
court
seemed
to
take
that
approach
in
the
mitsubishi
case
in
1985.
certainly,
however,
as
to
sro
arbitration,
which
are
the
three
arbitration
forums
before
the
court
today,
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
sec,
the
government
agency
given
the
power
to
enforce
the
securities
laws,
these
laws
have
been
set
up
to
protect
both
the
public
and
the
securities
industry,
and
there
is
always
going
to
be
a
majority
of
arbitrators--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--there
is
an
entire
uniform
code
of
arbitration
which
has
been
enacted
after
public
hearings
and
approval
by
the
sec
which
basically
provides
all
the
guidelines
and
rules
under
which
arbitration
is
held.
it
provides
for
discovery
in
certain
instances.
it
provides
for
document
production.
it
provides,
for
example,
for
arbitrators
to
have
subpoena
power
to
direct,
the
appearance
at
the
arbitration
of
different
parties
and
witnesses
that
are
needed
by
the
parties
in
the
case.
it
also
provides
for
a
majority--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--the
arbitrators
are
selected
by
panels
of
arbitrators
at
the
various
sros
which
are
taken
from
the
general
public
and
from
the
industry
and
from
business
and
from
all
walks
of
life.
but
specifically,
i
think
importantly,
with
respect
to
sro
arbitration
the
rules
specifically
provide
that
a
majority
of
the
panelists
will
always
be
from
outside
the
securities
industry.
i
think
that
is
important
because
it
ensures
that
the
individual
investors'
concerns
about
receiving
a
fair
hearing
at
these
forums
will
always
be
protected.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
the
way
it
is
done,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
a
number
of
panelists
are
picked
from
the
common
pool
by
the
arbitration
forum
itself,
by
the
arbitration
department.
then
under
the
rules
which
have
been
passed
and
enforced
by
the
sec
the
individual
parties
have
a
right
to
make
challenges
for
cause
or
peremptory
challenges,
just
as
they
would
in
federal
or
state
court
litigation.
certainly
whatever
the
common
reasons
are
for
objecting
for
cause,
such
as
bias
or
perhaps
a
relationship
with
the
parties,
are
also
in
arbitration
of
the
sros
a
basis
for
removing
an
arbitrator
who
might
be
partial
in
a
particular
case.
and
the
individuals
also
have
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
i
understand
the
point
you
are
making,
your
honor.
however,
it
has
been
our
experience
that
arbitration
proceedings
are
usually
completed
within
one
year
of
when
they
are
instituted.
finally,
although
obviously
the
court
is
not
required
to
do
so
to
find
in
petitioner's
favor
in
this
case,
we
think
the
best
approach
in
this
case
would
be
to
acknowledge
that
wilko
should
be
decided
differently
today
in
light
of
these
changes
in
arbitration
as
well
as
recent
decisions
of
this
court
which
emphasize
the
examination
of
congressional
intent
with
whether
or
not
congress...
with
respect
to
whether
congress
has
created
an
exception
to
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
wilko
court's
antiwaiver
analysis
seems
to
be
focused
more
on
public
policy
concerns
of
the
wilko
court
than
on
an
analysis
of
congressional
intent.
certainly
nowhere
in
the
exchange
act
or
its
legislative
history
did
congress
ever
state
that
it
intended
an
antiwaiver
provision
to
be
applicable
to
a
judicial
forum
selection.
the
true
meaning
of
the
antiwaiver
provision
as
developed
in
common
law
was
to
void
waiver
of
substantive
compliance
with
the
statute,
and
certainly
in
arbitration
proceedings
an
individual
does
not
waive
substantive
compliance
with
the
law.
the
individual
simply
switches
the
forum
where
those
rights
will
be
adjudicated.
the
parties'
agreement
should
also
be
enforced
with
respect
to
the
arbitration
of
rico
claims
because
again
congress
did
not
intend
to
exempt
rico
claims
from
the
arbitration
act.
once
again,
congress
could
simply
have
prohibited
arbitration
of
rico
claims
within
the
statute
itself,
which
it
did
not.
furthermore,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
evidences
any
congressional
intent
to
prohibit
arbitration
of
rico
claims,
nor
is
there
an
antiwaiver
provision
of
the
type
which
the
wilko
court
relied
upon.
the
court
of
appeals'
concern
with
the
public
nature
of
rico
claims
is
also
misplaced,
because
while
rico
has
an
incidental
public
deterrent
function,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
its
primary
function
is
to
compensate
victims
of
organized
crime.
by
ruling
that
either
10(b)
or
rico
claims
are
not
arbitrable,
this
court
would
have
to
decide
that
congress
intended
to
repeal
the
arbitration
act
by
implication
when
it
enacted
the
securities
act
and
rico.
such
repeals
by
implication
have
always
been
disfavored
by
this
court,
and
are
inapplicable
here
where
the
statutes
can
coexist
without
conflict
since
the
statutory
rights
of
the
individuals
can
be
enforced
by
arbitrators
subject
to
review
as
limited
by
congress
in
the
arbitration
act.
in
conclusion,
the
case
before
the
court
today
involves
allegations
that
an
investor's
account
was
mishandled
by
his
stockbroker.
petitioners
feel
that
arbitrators
are
better
equipped
than
juries
to
handle
these
primarily
factual
disputes
and
have
done
so
for
years,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
burden
the
federal
courts
with
these
types
of
cases.
furthermore,
the
sro
arbitration
forums
in
this
case
have
experienced
arbitrators,
including
former
judges
and
securities
attorneys,
always
have
a
majority
of
panelists
from
the
public,
and
operate
pursuant
to
rules
approved
by
the
sec
after
public
hearing.
petitioners
feel
that
the
continued
sec
supervision
and
rulemaking
authority
ensure
that
statutory
rights
will
be
enforced
through
arbitration.
by
enforcing
contracts
to
arbitrate
10(b)
and
rico
claims
the
court
will
allow
these
claims
to
be
heard
by
the
same
arbitrators
who
hear
the
parties'
state
and
common
law
claims
arising
from
the
same
factual
patterns.
this
will
avoid
the
bifurcating
proceedings
and
duplicative
proceedings
which
otherwise
result
in
the
very
type
of
delay
which
congress
hoped
to
avoid
when
it
passed
the
arbitration
act.
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
unless
there
are
questions.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
one
brief
point
with
respect
to
the
sec
rule
15(c)(2)-2,
since
the
sec
will
have
no
rebuttal
time.
the
sec's
position
on
this
has
always
been
that
that
particular
rule
is
simply
a
notice
provision
which
says
no
more
than
whatever
the
courts
happen
to
interpret
the
law
to
be
with
respect
to
arbitrability,
that
is
what
we
want
investors
to
be
apprised
of.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
i
presume
that
rule
will
continue
to
be
in
effect
pending
this
court's
clarification
of
the
issue.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
under
the
current
interpretation
of
the
law
as
we--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--it
doesn't
say
that
specifically,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
that
is
the
essence
of
it.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
exactly.
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
that
is
exactly
true,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
that
is
also
true,
your
honor.
