ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
united
states
olympic
committee
in
both
its
statutory
and
its
constitutional
position
in
this
case,
aims
and
hits
wide
of
the
mark.
congress,
in
the
enactment
of
the
amateur
sports
act
of
1978
sought
to
bestow
upon
the
united
states
olympic
committee
a
trademark
and,
among
other
things,
the
word
"olympic".
the
legislative
history
on
this
matter
is
plain.
in
part
it
states,
in
a
letter
from
the
commissioner
of
patents
and
trademarks,
and
this
is
at
page
7495
of
the
congressional
code
and
administrative
news
for
the
pertinent
bill,:
"it
is
our
understanding
that
this
sub-section....
"
the
sub-section
at
issue
in
this
case.
"#
is
intended
to
make
actionable
those
marks
which
falsely
represent
an
association
with
the
olympics.
"
so,
we
know
at
the
very
least,
from
the
legislative
history,
that
the
purpose
and
the
intent
of
the
user
of
the
word
"olympic"
does
matter
under
the
statute.
congress
cared
whether
a
user
of
the
word
u.s.
olympic
committee
or
not.
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
very
first
issue
that
should
have
been
tried
below
was
whether
the
"gay
olympic
games"
sponsors'
use
of
the
word
"olympic"
had
any
tendency
whatsoever
to
confuse,
to
cause
mistake
or
to
falsely
suggest
some
relationship
with
the
united
states
olympic
committee.
a
number
of
facts
in
the
record
would
have
borne
upon
that
question,
had
the
lower
court
afforded
us
a
trial.
for
example,
there
would
have
been
the
fact
that
san
francisco
arts
and
athletics
offered
to
place
a
disclaimer
of
an
appropriate
size
and
appropriate
effectiveness
on
all
of
its
paraphernalia,
claiming
"not
associated
with
the
united
states
olympic
committee.
"
perhaps
more
important
and
more
to
the
point
in
this
case,
is
the
fact
that
the
founders
of
the
dr.
waddell's
letter,
dr.
waddell
being
the
primary
volunteer
and
founder
of
the
games,
who
was
also
sued
as
a
party
defendant
below,
to
mr.
miller,
who
was
then
the
executive
director
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee.
he
wrote
him
a
letter
explaining
why
this
particular
organization
claimed
a
right
and
wished
to
have
consent
to
use
the
word
"olympic",
and
he
said,
i
think,
in
the
most
important
part
of
that
letter:
"colonel
miller,
these
games
are
very
specialized
indeed.
"
"our
outreach
and
emphasis
differs
widely
from
the
traditional
olympic
games,
in
that
we,
openly
gay
people
around
the
world
are
struggling
to
produce
an
image
that
more
closely
resembles
the
facts,
rather
than
some
libidinous
stereotype
generated
over
decades
of
misunderstanding
and
intolerance.
"
in
short,
the
essence
of
the
u.s.
olympics,
the
u.
s.
olympic
team
and
the
international
olympic
games.
there
was
no
confusion,
we
submit,
nor
was
any
proved
below
in
the
case
of
the
gay
users
of
the
word
"olympic"
and
congress
cared,
again,
whether
such
confusion
or
false
association
was
shown
and
it
cared
enough
to
put
in
the
statute
the
language
"tending
to
cause
confusion,
mistake
or
the
like.
"
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
that
is,
indeed,
one
reading
of
the
statute.
as
the
court
realizes,
what
congress,
i
think,
did
not
do--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--well,
it
is
reading
it,
it
seems
to
me,
also
without
attention
to
congress'
purpose,
which
was
to
prohibit
uses
of
the
word
"olympic",
whether
or
not
in
combination,
which
misled
people.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
yes,
and
in
the
puerto
rico
case
this
court
found
that
a
comma
ought
not
to
decide
a
question
of
public
policy
to
the
grammar,
that
is
to
say,
ought
not
to
exclude
the
other
two
elements
of
the
trivium,
which
are
logic
and
rhetoric.
now,
grammar
cannot
decide
the
significant
public
policy
question
before
this
court,
for
two
good
reasons.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
congress
writes
statutes
and
congress's
grammar,
justice
scalia,
is
not
the
primary
source
of
information
about
congress'
intent.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
that's
and
in
that
statute,
the
most
important
words
that
it
used
were
the
citation
to
the
lanham
act
and
the
language
"tending
to
cause
confusion".
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
well,
i
think
even
the
amicus
for
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
doesn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
that
is
the
only
reading
of
the
statute
that
makes
sense.
the
afcfl
brief
says
that
one
can
read
that
statute
either
of
the
two
ways
that
the
parties
have
presented
to
this
court.
that
is
why
i
say
the
question
here
does
not
hang
upon
the
absence
or
presence
of
a
comma.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
that's
right.
it
does
make
sense
because
it
was
congress's
purpose,
once
again,
as
set
forth
in
the
legislative
history,
to
make
actionable
those
marks
which
falsely
represent
an
association
with
the
olympics.
now,
we
can
use
some
other
language
in
the
statute
and
suggest
that
perhaps
congress
wasn't
perfectly
grammatical
in
the
exercise
of
its
legislative
verbiage
here,
when
it
said
combination
or
simulation
thereof.
certainly
congress
didn't
mean
to
reach
only
combinations
of
"olympic"
and
"olympiad"
or
simulations
of
"olympic".
it
meant
to
reach,
for
example,
a
trademark
infringer
using
the
following
language:
"we
are
the
official
u.s.
olympic
beer.
"
that
would
imply,
of
course,
that
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
had
an
involvement,
a
participation
in
this
particular
product
and
that
the
product
gave
support
to
the
u.s.
olympic
committee.
that's
a
combination
or
simulation
but
not
"thereof",
not
in
the
word
"olympic"
but
of
the
word
"olympic"
and
the
word
"beer".
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
that
is
not
only
not
how
i
believe
the
statute
here
should
be
interpreted
but
not
how
congress,
itself,
expressed
its
intent
in
the
legislative
history
when
it
said,
and
this
is
more
legislative
history,
from
the
text.
this
has
been
heavily
briefed
but
i
think
this
particular
segment
is
helpful:
"the
present
bill
does
not
make
the
use
of
the
various
designations
in
section
110(a)
unlawful.
"
and
the
court
will
note
that
there
was
bill
that
got
through
the
house,
that
would
have
given
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
sui
generis
protection
for
the
word.
not
a
trademark,
but
as
judge
kozinski
said
below,
"a
crown
monopoly"
on
the
use
of
"olympic".
no
one
could
use
it
except
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
and
anyone,
according
to
that
legislative
history,
who
used
the
word
"shall
be
liable
in
a
civil
action.
"
and
the
lanham
act
was
nowhere
referred
to
in
that
bill.
that
bill
was
rejected
in
favor
of
the
language
now
before
this
court
and
i
think
that
is
powerful
evidence
that
congress
didn't
mean,
didn't
intend
and
didn't
consider
putting
aside
every
use
of
the
word
u.s.
olympic
committee's
fiat
over
this
unusual
form
of
property.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
than
language
replicates
language...
i
was
going
to
say
simulates...
replicates
language
in
the
lanham
act.
that
is
the
kind
of
recital
of
a
trademark
owner's
right
that
one
finds
in
the
trademark
act.
that's
how
we
refer
to
trademark
owners,
exclusive
use
is
what
they
have
but
it
does
not
mean
exclusive
use
as
against
a
non-infringing
user,
and
it
does
not
mean
exclusive
use
in
this
case,
reaching
the
constitutional
matter,
of
a
word
separate
from
its
trademark
value
that
had
a
powerful,
political
and
associative
value,
not
only
to
gay
people
but,
apparently,
to
police,
armenians
and
a
variety
of
others
permitted
their
own
olympics
with,
if
not
the
imprimatur,
at
least,
the
tacit
consent
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee.
congress
did
not
go
anywhere
near
as
far
in
granting
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
a
right
in
the
word
u.s.
olympic
committee
contends
below
and
to
this
court,
and
they
are,
for
that
reason,
wide
of
the
trademark.
why
did
san
francisco
arts
and
athletics,
and
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
use
the
word
"olympic"?
couldn't
they
have
avoided
this
whole
exchange
about
what
congress
meant
by
saying
o.e.d.
couldn't
they
just
have
said
the
"gay
just-as-good-as-if-not-better-than
olympic
games"?
that
i
think,
as
i
read
the
u.s.
olympic
committee's
brief,
something
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
might
have
more
trouble
saying
was
infringing.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
there's
a
very
good
and
powerful
reason
for
san
francisco
arts
and
athletics
having
chosen
the
word,
other
than
the
u.s.
olympic
committee's
good
will
and
that
is
this;
the
word
is
ancient.
it
was
first
used
in
776
b.c.
and
it
was
used
to
identify
a
quadrennial
athletic
competition
in
a
culture
and
in
a
place
where
some,
at
least,
would
argue,
depending
on
your
classic
scholarship,
homosexuality
was
more
widely
tolerated
than
in
this
culture.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
they
did.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
not
at
all.
not
at
all,
and
the
evidence
of
record,
again,
is
very
strong
that--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--no,
no,
no.
i
think
it
would
not
have
done
anywhere
near
as
well.
i
think--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--i
think
it
would
have
been
to
the
word
mr.
cohen's
word
on
the
back
of
his
jacket
was
to,
i
strongly
resent.
i
think
judge
kozinski
below
was
correct
when
he
pointed
out
that
when
you
take
a
word
out
of
a
vocabulary
as
powerful
as
this
one,
when
you
withdraw
it
from
the
public
domain
and
you
bestow
it
on
what
we
believe,
and
will
contend,
is
a
state
actor,
even
if
you
bestow
it
on
a
private
party,
you
place
it
in
a
position
where
that
word
starves
for
lack
of
enjoyment
on
the
part
of
the
majority,
on
the
part
of
others.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
well,
i
think
that,
justice
scalia,
is
both
incorrect
and
a
tryable
dispute
of
material
fact.
what
the
court
seems
to
assume
in
that
question
is
that
there
is
no
other
association
on
the
part
of
the
public
with
the
word
u.s.
olympic
committee.
now,
i
think
the
record
shows,
if
it
doesn't
show
anything
else,
and
keeping
in
mind
that
there
was
no
trial,
that
there
is
a
vast
array
and
wide
variety
of
uses
of
the
word
u.s.
olympic
committee
and
many
of
which
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
chooses
not
to
sue,
that
reach
back
into
the
depths
of
this
word,
into
the
depths
of
its
history.
perhaps
not
going
to
the
o.e.d.
for
their
reference
but,
indeed,
understanding
that
the
word
1896
by,
if
not
millennia,
at
least
certainly
hundreds
of
years,
and
it
is
wrong,
i
think,
in
terms
of
summary
judgment
and
in
terms
of
federal
procedure,
to
assume
that
the
only
value
the
word
u.s.
olympic
committee
has
garnered
for
it
or
that
congress
has
chosen
to
believe
that
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
has
garnered
for
it.
but
i
think
here
we
have
to
pause
and
look
at
the
importance
of
the
purpose
of
the
user
because,
once
again,
below,
at
the
trial
level,
the
court
didn't
do
so.
congress
means
when
it
says
in
the
amateur
sports
act,
"tendency
to
confuse
and
the
like.
"
that
the
party
using
the
word
is
to
be
shown
to
have,
in
some
way,
impaired
the
value
of
the
word
relative
to
the
usoc.
no
such
showing
was
ever
made
below
in
this
case.
no
such
showing
was
ever
required
and
i
think
the
court
ought
to
keep
in
mind
that
it
is
the
contention
of
these
parties,
of
these
petitioners,
that
their
use
of
the
word
u.s.
olympic
committee's
good
will.
so,
at
the
very
minimum,
the
question
you
raise,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
was
a
tryable
dispute
of
a
material
fact.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
yes.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
if
there
is
no
confusion
requirement
in
the
statute,
then
we
get
to
the
question,
the
statutory
question,
if
we
stay
within
the
construct
of
dealing
with
the
statutory
questions
first,
then
we
get
to
the
statutory
question
of
whether
lanham
act
defenses
apply.
whether
the
lanham
act
defense
of
"fair
use
and
description
in
good
faith.
"
under
1115
before
in
the
lanham
act
applies,
for
example.
whether
the
common
law
defenses
are
important.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
the
statutory
predicate
for
that
argument
is
that
congress
phrased
the
statute
in
terms
of
lanham
act
remedies
and
we
take
the
position
that
congress,
in
that
reference,
in
that
signal
for
the
boundaries
of
the
statute,
meant
to
impose
on
this
trademark
holder
a
responsibility
to
keep
its
trademark
within
trademark
bounds.
congress
did
not
create
an
antidilution
law
in
this
case.
we
have
a
lot
of
argument
in
the
briefs
that
somehow
congress
really
meant
to
go
much
further
than
it
did
and
give
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
an
ability
to
control
use,
whether
confusing
or
not,
and,
more
than
that,
to
control
every
use
of
the
word
"olympic"
with
any
element
of
trade
involved,
even
if
the
element
of
commerce
was
subsidiary
and
i
think
once
again--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--that
is
our
position.
and
more
than
that,
justice
stevens,
i
think
because
it
is
true
for
legislative
history
that
one
has
words.
one
also
has
context
and
the
context
of
this
bill,
the
bill
that
ultimately
passed...
not
the
sui
generis
bill
but
the
trademark
bill,
was
trademark
language.
we
have
the
u.
s.
olympic
committee
in
this
court
contending,
apparently,
if
i
understand
their
brief,
that
congress
meant,
in
fact,
to
give
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
this
much
broader
power
to
go
in
and
prohibit
and
enjoin
and
sanction,
i
suppose,
and
get
damages
in
a
case
where
they
prove
them...
they
did
not
do
so
here...
any
other
users'
use
of
the
word
"olympic"
in
promotion
of
any
contest.
you'll
notice
that
"athletic"
doesn't
modify
the
word
"contest",
necessarily.
and
it
our
position
on
this
question
of
antidilution
that
congress
could
have
made
an
antidilution
law
with
relation
to
the
word
"olympic",
as
a
statutory
matter.
we'll
come
in
a
moment
to
the
question
of
constitutionality.
i
would
say
on
the
question
of
constitutionality
of
an
antidilution
law,
that
congress
could
make
an
antidilution
law
covering
the
word
"olympic"
the
way
that
porcupines
make
love
and
that
is
to
say,
with
painstaking
care.
they
did
nothing
of
the
sort
here.
they
made
a
law
that
granted
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
a
trademark.
the
u.s.
olympic
committee,
within
the
bounds
of
the
trademark,
has
successfully
and
without
any
great
resistance,
enforced
the
mark
against
real
infringers.
what
it
has
also
done,
starting
with
the
stop
the
olympic
prison
case
is,
it
has
made
an
argument,
based
on
the
statute,
that
it
is
essentially
entitled
to
control
any
use
of
the
word
u.s.
olympic
committee's
purposes
and
we
think
congress
didn't
go
nearly
so
far
in
this
statute.
let
me
turn
to
the
problem
of
what
it
would
mean
if
congress
did
go
so
far,
because
i
think
there
are
questions,
there
are
extremely
profound
and
important
constitutional
questions
here
that
have
to
be
raised.
i
think
the
bridge...
there
probably
are
several...
but
the
conceptual
bridge
that
occurs
to
me
between
trademark
law
and
the
first
amendment
in
particular
and
the
constitution
in
general,
the
bridge
in
this
case
is
the
bridge
of
genericness,
classificatory
language
and
as
i
understand
this
court's
opinion
in
dollar
park
and
fly,
a
generic
word
is
not
registrable.
i
quote
from
the
court:
"generic
terms
are
not
registrable
and
a
registered
mark
may
be
cancelled
at
any
time
on
the
grounds
that
it
has
become
generic.
"
and
as
i
understand
it,
again,
the
term
generic
refers
to
a
genus,
such
as
"olympic"
and,
for
example,
in
this
case
then
the
phrase
"gay
olympic
games"
would
refer
to
a
species.
the
genus
that
"olympic"
represents,
the
generic
term
that
"olympic"
represents
cannot
be
registered
as
a
trademark.
so
congress
did
here
as
a
constitutional
matter
what
congress
cannot
do
in
general
with
words
under
the
lanham
act.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
marks
that
constitute
a
common
descriptive
name
are
referred
to
as
generic.
generic
terms
are
not
registrable
and...
yes,
i
am.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
think
there
is
language
in
the
case
that
indicates
the
court's
sensitivity
to
the
relationship
between
the
commercial
element
of
the
generic
terms
doctrine
and
the
free
speech
element
of
that
doctrine.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
please.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
only,
i
think,
in
dictum
dealing
with
the
dissent.
that
is
to
say,
in
saying:
be
reassured
that
congress
cannot
give
away
words
here
because
there
is
a
generic
terms
doctrine
and
because
there
is
a
fair
use
and
description
doctrine.
but
in
so
many
words,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
this
court
did
not
do
so
there.
this
court
did
not
have
to
do
so
there.
this
court
will,
if
it
finds
that
congress
indeed
meant
to
strip
away
"tending
to
confuse"
and
not
apply
it
to
a
case
like
this
one,
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
the
generic
words
doctrine
has
a
constitutional
root
and
it
is
our
position
that
it
does.
and
it's
a
very
simple
constitutional
root.
it
is
quite
logical.
the
idea
is
this.
if
congress,
in
the
best
interests
of
whatever
legislation
it
proposes,
decides
that
the
value
of
a
word
is
such
that
to
bestow
it
upon
an
entity
will
further
that
entity's
purposes
and
congress
then
withdraws
from
the
common
domain
or,
as
some
call
it,
the
marketplace
of
ideas,
a
word
and
bestows
it
upon
that
entity
for
that
entity's
control,
there
are
first
amendment
implications
to
that
bestowal
if
that
word
is
not
bestowed
within
a
legal
boundary,
within
a
framework.
judge
kozinski,
in
dissent
from
the
denial
of
rehearing
en
banc
below,
i
think
phrased
well
the
problem,
which
is
that
when
you
loose
these
rights
and
intellectual
property
from
their
conceptual
moorings,
from
their
trademark
law
or
other
property
right
boundaries
and
you
set
them
free,
they
roam
across
the
first
amendment
and
take
things
away
from
people,
such
as
the
right
of
free
speech
in
a
fashion
that
congress
is
surely
not
free
to
do.
but
let's
start
at
the
beginning,
i
think,
of
the
whole
question
of
whether--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--comparing
it
to
something
as
opposed
to
having
it
exists
on
it's
own?
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
bird
soap?
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
yes,
i
think
probably--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
pardon
me?
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--bird
is
a
genus;
that's
right.
but
bird
soap
does
not
have
either
the
history
of
the
word
"olympic"
in
conjunction
with
athletic
contests.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
right.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
think
here's
the
trouble
with
that
approach,
as
i
see
it.
the
main
trouble
i
see
with
that
approach
is
that
it
would
sponsor
trademark
parody
at
the
cost
of
serious
speech.
take,
for
example,
the
girl
scout
poster.
you
have
a
pregnant
girl
scout
in
the
personality
posters
case...
it's
cited
to
this
court
in
the
amicus...
and
what
the
court
said
there
is,
is
no
one
in
the
world
who
is
ever
going
to
associate
this
with
the
girl
scouts
because
those
two
things
just
don't
go
together.
the
idea
being
then,
that
a
trademark
parody,
an
absurdity,
a
piece
of
spurious
or
silly
speech
can
use
a
generic
word
outside
the
trademark
context
and
enjoy
the
full
ambit
of
first
amendment
protection.
a
serious
use
of
a
generic
word
outside
its
expected
context,
such
as
"gay
olympic
games",
then
deserves
under
this
analysis,
less
protection
than
a
frivolous
use
of
a
generic
term
and
i
think
that's
probably
more
than
dangerous
when
it
comes
to
affording
the
drawing
of
some
boundary
around
the
relationship
between
trademark
law
and
the
first
amendment.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
and
call
it
"soap
soap"?
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
don't
believe
you
could
do
so
as
a
trademark
law
matter
but--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--i
suppose
you
could.
what
i'm
trying
to
do
at
this
point
is,
move
the
court
to
the
consideration
of
the
constitutional
implications
of
permitting
the
having,
not
of
"soap
soap"
but
of
a
"gay
olympic
games".
you
see,
you
talking
in
commercial
analogies--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--right.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
well,
there's
a
very
strong
procedural
answer
to
your
question
and
that
is,
from
this
record,
without
a
trial,
this
court
cannot
properly
say
that
my
client
was
using
the
word
analogously
as
opposed
to
literally,
by
your
definition
of
the
distinction.
it
is
my
contention
from
this
record
that
dr.
waddell
told
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
"we're
using
the
word
in
an
ancient
generic
sense.
"
in
a
sense
of
the
word
as
he
put
it
in
his
letter
"that
pre-dated
christ",
so
for
this
court
to
say,
"you
really
meant
it
this
way.
"
,
is,
i
think,
to
ignore
the
fact
that
there
was
no
trial
in
this
case
that
would
have
disposed
of
that
question
and
the
parties'
intent
was
entirely
relevant
both
as
a
statutory
and
a
constitutional
matter.
i
wish
very
quickly
to
say
one
thing
about
state
action.
one
thing.
and
that
is,
that
in
the
very
statute
that
we're
looking
to
for
the
sake
of
interpretation
in
this
case,
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
is
given
power
to
"organize,
finance
and
control
the
representation
of
the
united
states
in
the
olympic
games.
"
and
that
statute
goes
on,
section
375,
to
describe
a
number
of
powers
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
that
make
it
plainly
different
from
a
private
hospital
or
a
private
nursing
home
or
a
private
school,
such
as
were
before
the
court
in
blum
and
in
rendell-baker.
this
is
much
more
the
appearance
of
a
state
actor
than
were
present
in
any
of
those
cases
and,
once
again,
absent
a
trial,
it
seems
rash
for
this
court
to
do
what
the
lower
courts
did,
throw
aside
the
indicia
of
state
action
and
say,
"but
we'll
find
it
wasn't
a
state
actor
here.
"
i'd
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
have
a
little
bit
of
latin
left
for
the
court
and
this
is
not,
this
time,
the
latin
of
the
trivium
of
grammar,
logic
and
rhetoric,
but
the
latin
that
says
that
in
litigation
a
court
should
be
concerned
with
facts.
my
opponent
has
argued
to
this
court
that
the
olympics
is
unique.
we
won't
dispute
that,
justice
marshall,
and
then
he
has
gone
on
to
contend
that
it
is
the
only
thing
called
the
olympics,
and
there
i
think
he
defies
the
open
record
in
a
rather
blatant
and
important
way.
what
this
court
has
before
it
is
a
record,
granted,
again,
without
a
trial,
that
shows
that
the
word
"olympic"
has
been
used...
continues
to
be
used
in
a
variety
of
contexts
to
describe,
among
other
things,
athletic
events
held
by
what
some
might
consider
to
be
minority
groups.
among
those
most
vividly
and
obviously
similar
to
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
in
terms
of
athletic
activity,
we
have
in
the
record,
the
police
with
their
international
olympics
and
the
exhibits
show
that
they
are
using
the
five
rings.
in
fact,
i
understand
two
of
those
are
handcuffs
but
they
are
five
rings,
all
the
same.
with
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
in
1982
representing
to
the
court,
"oh,
there's
no
discrimination
here.
"
,
we
wrote
them
a
letter
and
in
1984
when
the
police
continued
to
use
the
word
"olympic",
no
one
says
anything
and
they
proceed.
with
all
respect,
the
question
of
discrimination
here
is
not
a
tiny
one,
it
is
not
small
one,
it
is
not
a
trivial
one
because
we
have
an
entity
funded
by
the
u.s.
government
and
here
i
want
to
say
on
the
point
of
funding,
there
has
been
a
little
bit
of
an
anomaly,
i
think,
in
the
usoc's
position,
because
they
argue
on
the
one
hand,
"congress
gave
us
our
most
valuable
asset
in
these
trademarks.
"
"we
raised
forty
(40)
million
dollars
with
them.
"
miller's
affidavit
shows
that.
and
then
they
turn
around
in
the
state
action
realm
and
they
say,
"we
never
got
any
government
funding.
"
,
and
that's
the
mistake
that
the
de
frantz
court
made
as
well.
they
said,
"this
entity
isn't
funded
by
the
government.
"
funding
alone
is
not
state
action.
we're
well
aware
of
that.
there
are
a
number
of
other
factors
here.
all
the
factors
this
court
has
set
forth
as
important
to
state
action,
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
structural
derivative
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
from
congress.
the
board
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
was
named
by
congress
in
the
first
section
of
the
amateur
sports
act,
371.
that
makes
this
case
dramatically
different
than
rendell-baker
versus
kohn.
the
state
action
question
cannot
be
lightly
set
aside
here,
and
in
this
case,
what
should
happen
is
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
a
trial
on
the
factual
questions
that
determine
whether
this
is
a
state
actor.
the
reason
that's
so
important
is
that,
otherwise,
san
francisco
arts
and
athletics,
which
has
set
forth
some
serious
and
important
counter-claims
about
invasion
of
its
first
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
will
never
have
a
trial
on
those
counter-claims
because
the
court
will
do
what
the
lower
courts
have
done
and
depart
from
its
own
precedents
about
what
the
indicia
of
state
action
are.
but
i
think
an
even
more
crucial
departure
from
the
factual
record
occurred
in
my
opponent's
argument--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--well,
that
opens
the
bill
of
rights
to
us,
in
terms
of
litigation.
surely
that
doesn't
mean
we
win
the
discrimination
claim,
it
means
we
get
to
litigate.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
well,
again,
this
court
is
only
in
a
position
to
say
there
should
have
been
a
trial
on
the
question.
that's
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case.
i
don't
think
this
court
is
about
to--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--there's
another
first
amendment
issue
that
is
perhaps
deeper
than
the
one
as
to
whether
this
particular
organization,
san
francisco
arts
and
athletics,
can
hold
an
olympics,
and
that
is,
does
congress
have
the
power
to
give
away
words
in
the
public
domain?
and
that
constitutional
issue
is
sufficiently
fundamental
that
if
this
court
finds--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--right.
but
it
this
court
finds...
right.
that
state
action
is
plain
enough.
congress's
action
is
unambiguously
the
action
of
the
state.
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
congress
acted
outside
its
constitutional
bounds
in
bestowing
the
trademark
to
begin
with,
then
certainly
that
would
be
held
unconstitutional.
we've
taken
the
position
all
along
that
that's
the
last
issue
this
court
need
reach.
judge
kozinski,
i
think,
takes
a
somewhat
different
position
and
seems
to
contend
that--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
--because
it
is
the
bridge,
it
is
the
gateway
to
my
client's
litigation
of
its
counter-claims
that
it
was
discriminated
against
and
that
its
speech
was
suppressed
when
the
u.
s.
olympic
committee
chose
it,
and
it
alone,
among
these
many
users
of
the
word
"olympic"
to
describe
athletic
contests
to
suppress
that
speech.
there
is
evidence
of
record
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
usoc
toward
my
client.
it
is
an
equal
protection
claim,
justice
white.
and
framed
so
in
the
counter-claims
which
are
at
the
very
end
of
volume
i
of
the
joint
appendix.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
the
counter-claims
were
dismissed.
the
lower
court
said
no
state
action...
in
the
only
case
where
the
courts
ever
dealt
with
state
action,
meaning
defrantz,
there
was
no
state
action
found.
the
court
never
addressed
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
as
the
state
action
doctrine
should
have
applied
to
them.
let
me
address
one
more
point
of
counsel's
argument,
if
i
may.
counsel
said
to
this
court,
"when
people
think
of
the
olympic
games,
they
are
thinking
of
the
creation
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
and
not
of
something
that
happened
under
a
mountain
in
ancient
greece.
"
i
think
at
this
point
we
have--
