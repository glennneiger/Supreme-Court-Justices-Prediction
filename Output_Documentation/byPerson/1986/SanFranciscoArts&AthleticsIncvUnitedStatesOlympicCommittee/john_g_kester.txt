mr.
john
g.
kester
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
deal
in
a
moment,
if
i
may,
with
the
questions
of
legislative
history
and
purpose
of
the
statute
that
were
raised
in
the
earlier
argument
but
i
would
say
at
the
beginning,
that
as
we
see
it,
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
a
constitutional
issue
because
we
think
the
statute
clearly
covers
and
the
issue
is
whether
congress
had
sufficient
basis
to
pass
this
very
important
legislation,
which
is
the
foundation
of
amateur
sports
in
the
united
states
and
which
imposes
a
very
limited
and
a
very
traditional
kind
of
restriction
on
petitioners
use
of
a
label.
whether
congress,
in
short,
could
prevent
them
from
using
the
u.s.
olympic
committee's
label
to
label
their
week-long
international
athletic
games
and
there
are
three
points
that
i
think
centrally
bear
on
that
question.
the
first
is
that
this
was
not
some
kind
of
whimsical
or
casual
or
improvident
largesse
on
the
part
of
congress.
congress
was
recognizing,
as
it
had
earlier
in
1950...
and
i
might
say,
justice
scalia,
that
the
1950
statute
sheds
light
also
on
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
1978
statute.
the
1950
statute
clearly
had
no
requirement
of
confusion
in
it.
congress
was
recognizing
that
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
and
the
international
olympic
committee
were
the
creators
of
the
modern
olympic
games.
congress
was
providing
a
very
limited
labeling
protection
for
that
very
important
creation
and
when
people
think
of
the
olympic
games
today,
the
connotation
of
that
word
"olympic",
the
state
of
greek
scholarship
in
this
country
is
not
such
today
that
they
are
thinking
of
something
that
happened
in
valley
under
mount
olympus
as
a
religious
festival
in
honor
of
olympian
zeus.
they
are
thinking
about
the
creation
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
and
international
olympic
committee
going
back
to
a
group
of
people
who
got
together
in
1896
and
thought
that
they
would
create
something
that
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
world.
congress
and
the
states
protect
creations
of
all
kinds,
all
the
time,
under
various
legal
headings
and
i
would
say
the
lanham
act
certainly
does
not
exhaust
the
constitutional
power
of
congress.
in
fact,
trademarks
do
not
even
exhaust
what
the
lanham
act
does,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
ives
labs
case,
section
43
of
the
lanham
act
may
very
well
go
beyond
trademark
protection,
but
we
have
categories
of
misappropriation,
antidilution,
trademark,
sometimes
copyright
and
sometimes
something
even
called
privacy,
as
we
had
in
the
zacchini
case,
and
all
of
those
kinds
of
protection
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
and
most
of
them
have
been
upheld
against
various
kinds
of
first
amendment
challenge.
as
this
court
said
in
friedman
against
rogers,
which
dealt
specifically
with
trade
names,
this
court
said
that
when
there
is
an
adequate
state
purpose,
states
can
regulate
the
use
of
trade
names
and
that
this
court
is
very
cautious
and
very
reluctant
in
approaching
first
amendment
challenges
to
commercial
economic
regulations.
the
second
main
point
is
that
what
is
at
stake
here
is
the
life
blood
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee.
there
was
a
very
important
interest
that
congress
recognized
here.
the
legislation
in
1978
was
passed
at
the
culmination
of
a
two-year
study
by
a
presidential
commission,
and
that
presidential
commission
concluded
that
u.s.
amateur
sports
were
in
a
tremendously
difficult
and,
in
fact,
decaying
situation
and
that
there
were
two
things,
two
things
that
were
the
problem
with
u.s.
amateur
sports
at
that
time.
the
first
was
disorganization,
which
was
hurting
the
athletes
themselves,
and
the
second
was
lack
of
funding,
and
it
was
clear
in
that
report
of
the
presidential
commission,
which
came
in
after
two
years
in
1977,
and
it
is
clear
throughout
the
legislative
history
of
the
amateur
sports
act
of
1978...
you
cannot
escape
it...
that
one
thing
that
the
commissioners
and
the
congress
were
all
intent
upon
was
keeping
amateur
sports
well-funded
but
in
the
private
sector.
moreover,
in
order
to
deal
with
the
problems
that
that
presidential
commission
had
recognized
and
pointed
out,
congress
did
not
just
hand
out
a
gift
here.
what
congress
created
here
was
a
two-way
street.
congress
said,
we
will
continue
as
we
had
in
1950
to
protect
the
word
"olympic"
and
the
other
words
and
symbols
associated
with
the
olympic
games.
we
will
give
civil
right
of
action
instead
of
the
criminal
offense
that
existed
in
1950.
we
will
continue
all
that
but
usoc
has
to
do
something
in
return.
and
if
you
look
at
section
104
of
the
act,
there
are
fourteen
different
duties
and
obligations,
a
long
list
of
obligations
that
were
imposed
upon
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
in
return
for
what
it
received
from
the
congress
in
the
way
of
protection
for
its
mark.
the
third
point
i
would
make,
is
that
clearly
what
petitioners
were
seeking
here
was
a
free
ride
on
the
good
will
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee's
good
name.
what
was
going
on
here--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
think
we
start
as
the
dollar
park
and
fly
case
said
and
as
justice
scalia
noted
earlier,
justice
o'connor,
with
the
language
of
the
act.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
clearly
it
doesn't
in
case
because
if
congress
had
meant
that,
congress
would
have
been
doing
nothing
more
than
it
had
already
done
in
the
lanham
trademark
act.
mr.
john
g.
kester
it
would
be
doing
very
little
more,
justice
o'connor,
because
there
was
a
trademark
on
the
word
"olympic".
mr.
john
g.
kester
it
was
on
the
word
"olympic"
and
there
were
also
trademarks
on
the
symbols,
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
trademark
law,
justice
scalia,
derivatives
are
treated
by
the
trademark
office
as
being
incorporated
within
a
mark.
in
other
words,
if
you
had
"olympic"
or
"olympiad",
"olympiad"
might
well
be
covered
by
the
word
"olympic".
so
there
was
no
question
here
of
the
validity
of
the
trademark
that
usoc
already
had.
it
is
suggested
in
the
reply
brief
that
somehow
that
was
an
unenforceable
mark.
the
fact
is,
it
was
enforced
before
1978
under
the
trademark
laws.
there
are
cases.
there
was
a
case
in
the
middle
district
of
florida.
a
case
in
the
u.s.
district
court
in
missouri.
many
cases
in
the
trademark
office.
what
congress
had
in
mind
here
was
to
something
more
than
provide
trademark
protection,
which,
of
course,
depends
on
showings
of
likelihood
of
confusion
and
which
usually
means
that
there
has
to
be
a
trial.
it
means
that
there
is
no
simple
way
to
enforce
a
trademark,
and
what
they
were
concerned
with
beyond
the
cost
of
a
trial,
they
were
interested,
of
course,
in
the
usoc
spending
its
money
on
amateur
sports
and
not
on
lawyers.
what
they
were
interested
in
was
also
preventing
dilution
of
the
name.
this
is,
we
contend,
and
we
think
with
absolutely
clear
basis
in
the
legislative
history,
what
is
called
an
antidilution
statute,
such
as
we
have
in
practically
every
commercial
center
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
the
united
states
right
now.
we
think
congress
clearly
had
adequate
and
ample
basis
to
pass
an
antidilution
statute,
in
the
context
of
what
these
people
had
done,
to
make
something
of
the
word
u.s.
olympic
committee's
willingness
to
undertake
to
promote
and
to
enhance
amateur
sports
in
the
united
states.
this
law
has
basically
been
the
magna
charta
of
amateur
sports
in
the
united
states.
there
has
been,
since
1978,
a
real
renaissance.
when
you
think
of
the
activities
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee,
and
these
can
be
seen
in
the
record,
you
should
not
think
that
what
they
do
with
the
money
that
they
get
from
licensing
the
name
is
simply
buy
airplane
tickets
for
athletes
to
go
to
games
throughout
the
world.
mr.
john
g.
kester
a
"fair
use"
defense
would
simply
lead
to
more
and
more
litigation,
justice
o'connor,
and,
simply,
what
we're
saying
is,
in
the
context
of
antidilution
there
might
be
some
situation
where
you
could
imagine,
for
instance,
if
someone
were
saying
"we
protest
the
olympic
games".
and
there
is
not
an
ounce
of
suggestion
in
this
record
that
anyone
was
protesting
the
olympic
games
here.
if
it
came
to
the
point
of
discussion,
of
public
controversy,
that
sort
of
thing,
we
don't
think
the
statute
would
apply
because
this
statute
is
limited
to
a
very
specified
and
narrow
range
of
uses,
which
congress
set
forth
for
purposes
of
trade--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--"fair
use"
defenses,
justice
o'connor,
first
of
all,
are
a
statutory
matter
under
the
lanham
act,
under
the
copyright,
whatever.
so
what
the
petitioners
are
talking
about
here,
i
think,
is
some
sort
of
constitutional
privilege
rather
than
a
"fair
use"
defense.
what
petitioners
did
here,
justice
o'connor,
is
to
essentially
stage
the
modern
olympic
games.
in
fact,
they
refer
throughout
the
record
to
the
traditional
olympic
games
and
they
compare
themselves
to
that.
at
page
403
of
the
record,
they
say
"the
modern
olympic
games"
is
what
they
are
emulating.
in
every
respect--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--absolutely,
and
it
would--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--when
congress
incorporated
the
remedies,
i
think
it
was
simply
using
a
shorthand.
it
said
that
if
this
mark
is
used
in
this
way,
the
normal
lanham
act
type
of
remedy
shall
follow
but
it
was
not
reenacting
the
lanham
act,
because
it
didn't
have
to.
they
already
had
a
trademark,
and
to
the
extent
that
certain
uses
might
be
thought
to
be
outside
the
scope
of
what
congress
intended,
i
suppose
one
could
say
that
congress
certainly
would
not
want
to
get
into
some
fringe
area
where
the
constitution
might
well
be
involved,
and
that
could
be
called
"fair
use"
or
it
could
be
called
constitutional
privilege,
but
what
we
have
here
is,
in
this
case,
an
actual
copying
of,
a
virtual
reproduction
of
the
modern
olympic
games.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
it
certainly
isn't
this
case,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
think
the
first
answer
that
i
would
give
to
that...
several
to
that...
the
first
is
what
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
an
argument
this
morning
and
that's
that
we
don't
expect
that
congress
is
going
to
do
silly
things
and
the
congress,
when
it
passes
an
act,
it
has
the
benefit
of
a
presumption
of
constitutionality.
now,
if
baseball
were,
as
in
this
case,
a
term
which
really
had
no
particular
significance
or
only
a
distant
mythological,
historical
significance
and
a
group
of
people
had
done
something
to
improve
baseball,
had
done
something
to
give
it
some
meaning
and
it
was
in
a
moribund
state
and
congress
then
said,
"let's
ask
this
group,
in
return
for
doing
some
other
things
for
us,
to--
"
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
can't
help
you
there.
mr.
john
g.
kester
but
another
thing
that
i
think
should
be
considered,
too,
is
that
there
is
a
grandfather
clause
in
the
statute
and
obviously
congress
did
reasonably
have
in
mind
that
the
name
had
been
in
use
in
the
past
in
a
legitimate
way
and
it
didn't
intend
to
upset
vested
rights
but
can
congress,
in
the
unique
circumstances
that
we
have
here,
pass
what
is
really
a
law
not
very
much
different...
in
fact,
it's
much
more
narrow...
in
fact,
it's
much
better
thought
out
than
the
antidilution
statutes
of
many
states.
can
congress
do
that?
of
course
it
can.
mr.
john
g.
kester
in
the
commercial
sense?
mr.
john
g.
kester
and
are
you
going
to
put
in
a
grandfather
clause?
mr.
john
g.
kester
and
are
you
going
to--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--and
did
the
word
"baseball"
gain
popularity
as
the
result
of
the
efforts
of
the
group
to
whom
you
are
giving--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--but
it
was
this
group
that
caused
it
to
become
popular?
mr.
john
g.
kester
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
it
since
abner
doubleday
until
this
group
go
together?
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
that
what
you
have
at
stake,
justice
stevens,
in
this
case
as
in
so
many
cases
that
come
up
here
where
there
is
a
first
amendment
defense
asserted,
is
you
have
to
weigh
the
scope
of
the
restriction
against
the
substantiality
of
the
state
interest
and
i
doubt,
in
your
hypothetical,
that
the
state
interest
would
be
nearly
so
great
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
scope
of
the
restriction...
baseball
is
something
that
is
much
more
universal
than
the
olympic
games.
the
olympic
games
are
something
very
special,
they
are
very
simple,
they
are
very
unique.
we
know
what
they
are
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--the
answer
is,
i'd
like
to
hear
argument
on
it.
i'm
pretty
sure
it's
no
but
i
think
that
the
question
has
to
be
put--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--sure.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
a
difference.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes.
that's--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--you
mean
the
term
"major
league"?
mr.
john
g.
kester
you're
adding
that--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--and
i
assume
then
that
your
statute
would
give
that
protection
to
the
major
leagues?
mr.
john
g.
kester
and
they
could
call
their
product
major
league
baseball
and
they
would
do
certain
things
for
the
government
and
the
public?
mr.
john
g.
kester
it
is.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i've
been
inadequately
primed
to
say
that,
justice
marshall.
they
are
different.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
olympics
are
certainly
a
charitable,
non-profit,
eleemosynary,
do-good,
if
you
want,
institution
in
our
society
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--this
is
a
form
of
subsidy.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
government
subsidizes
all
kinds
of
things,
as
we
all
well
know.
mr.
john
g.
kester
my
answer
on
major
league
baseball
is
that
that
gets
closer
than
"baseball"
did
but
it
is
certainly
nothing,
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
as
unique
as
the
olympics.
there's
only
one
thing
called
the
olympic
games
and
everybody
knows
what
the
games
are
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--it's
the
modern
olympic
games.
mr.
john
g.
kester
major
league
baseball?
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
that's
for
another
day.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i'm
trying
to
leave
some
room
and
i
don't
think
congress
is
going
to
pass
that
law,
particularly
given
the
economic
aspects
of
major
league
baseball
but
i
think
probably
they
could.
yes.
i
spoke
of
the
first
amendment
earlier.
i
will
say
something
about
the
legislative
history.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
fair
way
to
read
the
statute
other
than
the
way
we
suggest.
there
is
no
requirement
for
confusion
in
that
statute
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
1950
statute,
which
was
a
criminal
law,
there
was
nothing
about
confusion
in
that,
and
when
this
act
was
passed...
i
will
just
give
you
as
a
sample
of
the
kind
of
statements
that
were
made
in
the
congressional
record,
mr.
kindness,
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill
said:
"the
bill
significantly
expands
the
purposes
and
powers
of
the
u.s.
olympic
committee.
"
"in
addition,
the
u.
s.
olympic
committee
is
granted
broadened
exclusive
use
protection
with
respect
to
the
olympic
symbol,
emblem
and
name.
"
and
that
kind
of
language
is
throughout
the
history,
if
there
were
any
doubt.
clearly,
they
intended
to
broaden
and
to
give
a
civil
remedy.
mr.
john
g.
kester
many
of
them
would
be.
and
many
of
them
are
de
minimis
from
the
point
of
view
of
litigating.
usoc
doesn't
want
to
litigate
against
everybody
but
this
is
the
biggest
infringement
that
ever
happened.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
don't
think
so.
i
would
not...
if
we're
talking
about
non-grant...
there
were
produced
in
the
lower
court
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
letters
that
the
olympic
committee
had
sent
to
various
people
who
were
infringing
the
name
"olympic",
and
the
fact
is,
fortunately,
we
live
in
a
law-abiding
society,
and
most
infringers
stop.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
would
be
our
position.
i
doubt
that
we
would
do
it.
mr.
john
g.
kester
we
are
interested
in
sports
but
we
are
not
interested
in
litigating.
i
stand
before
you
as
a
living
example
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
and
here
we
are.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
will
address
it
to
the
extent
the
court
desires,
justice
o'connor.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
reach
the
point,
because
that
issue,
as
i
take
it,
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
some
sort
of
selective
prosecution.
i
think
the
record
amply
shows
that
there
was
no
sort
of
singling
out
when
usoc
sued
the
largest
infringer
and
copier
that
had
ever
come
along
of
its
name.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
would
say
that
it
was,
justice
o'connor,
in
the
findings
that
chief
judge
peckham
made
on
the
preliminary
injunction.
he
made
a
finding
that
there
had
been
no
discrimination.
what
happened
after
that
was
that
there
was
approximately
a
year
of
discovery
that
went
on
and
nothing,
nothing
was
put
into
the
record.
there
was
nothing,
when
it
got
to
summary
judgment,
to
support
the
assertion
that
was
made
that
there
had
been
some
kind
of
selective
prosecution
discrimination,
here.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
take
it
that
the
issue
was
preliminarily
settled
on
the
preliminary
injunction
motion,
that
nothing
was
put
in
the
record
on
it.
the
summary
judgement
record
is
before
this
court
and
if
this
court
looks
at
the
summary
judgment
record,
it
will
find
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
there
to
show
selective
prosecution.
they
came
in
and
they
said,
"well,
no
one
else
has
ever
been
sued.
"
the
u.
s.
olympic
committee
put
in
ample
evidence
that
many
people
had
been
sued,
even
when
the
statute
was
as
new
as
it
was
at
that
time,
and
then
they
said,
"well,
you
didn't
sue
non-profit
organizations.
"
,
and
we
put
in
evidence
that
five
(5)
non-profit
organizations
were
sued,
and
they
said,
"well,
you
didn't
sue
them
until
you
sued
us.
"
,
and
then
there
was
evidence
that
two
of
them
had
been
sued
before
they
were
sued.
so
it
is,
if
i
may
use
the
vernacular,
simply
a
"bum
rap".
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
support
that,
and
even
if
there
were,
i
cannot
imagine
that
the
doctrine
of
state
action,
of
governmental
action,
as
it
has
been
applied
in
the
past
by
this
court,
would
possibly
extend
to
this
private
organization.
congress
said
over
and
over
and
over
again,
for
example,
that
they
intended
to
keep
amateur
sports
private
and
wanted
to
keep
the
government
out
of
it.
so
i
think
that
with
respect
to
state
action,
we
just
can't
get
there
from
here
on
this
record,
nor
should
we.
mr.
john
g.
kester
surely.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
that
when
you
get
into...
if
you
are
saying,
"i
am
the
winner
of
three
olympic
events....
"
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
then
you
are
getting
kind
of
into
the
area
of
news
and
we
have
never
contended--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
understand
but
if
it's
the
individual
and
he's
saying,
"i
won
three
olympic
events".
mr.
john
g.
kester
it's
not
this
case,
obviously.
mr.
john
g.
kester
and
the
statute
might
be
we
have
taken
the
position
since
as
early
as
page
20
of
the
record
in
this
case,
that
newsworthiness
is
something
that
we
regard
as
constitutionally
privileged
and
if
there
is--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--if
somebody
wants
to
say,
"i
won
three
olympic
events....
"
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
might
be
within
the
statute.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that,
i
would
say,
is
clearly
covered.
clearly
covered.
mr.
john
g.
kester
not
quite
as
clearly
as
justice
o'connor's.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
reason
i
hesitate
is
this,
justice
stevens,
in
your
example
you
were
saying.
"i
am
the
winner
of
three
olympic....
"
mr.
john
g.
kester
you
mean,
they
are
presumably
doing
it
with
his
consent?
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
under
the
statute,
yes,
but
you'd
have
to
look
also
at
the
rights
of
the
athlete
in
that
situation.
i
mean,
he
may
be
like
zacchini,
in
the
zacchini
case--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
mean,
his
performance...
he
may
have
some
common
law
right
of
his
own
but
i
think
the
statute
would
cover
it.
i
would
only
sum
up
by
saying
that
a
more
eloquent
lawyer
than
i
was
daniel
webster,
who
was
before
this
court
in
the
dartmouth
college
case,
which
also
involved
a
charter
of
an
eleemosynary
institution,
and
he
summed
up
the
statute
you
have
before
you
in
one
sentence,
which
says
it
much
better
than
i
can.
he
said:
"a
charter
of
more
liberal
sentiments,
of
wiser
provisions,
drawn
with
more
care
or
in
a
better
spirit
could
not
be
expected
at
any
time
or
from
any
source.
"
and
at
that
point,
he
lapsed
into
latin,
which
i
shall
spare
you.
thank
you
very
much.
