unknown
speaker
the
language
referred
to,
i
mean,
the
full
phrase
is
"the
words
"olympic",
"olympiad",
"citius
altius
fortius"
or
any
combination
or
simulation
thereof
tending
to
cause
confusion.
"
unknown
speaker
it
is
reading
it
without
a
comma,
which
is
the
way
it
is
written.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
know
that?
the
best
indication
of
congress'
purpose
is
what
they
wrote.
unknown
speaker
the
congress
should
but
the
congress
writes
statutes.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
its
grammar.
i
am
talking
about
its
meaning.
i
am
talking
about
the
words
that
it
wrote
and
the
symbols
that
it
used.
unknown
speaker
how
does
it
mean
anything
to
say
the
word
"olympic"
or
any
combination...
the
word
"olympic"
tending
to
cause
confusion,
to
cause
mistake,
to
deceive?
it
makes
no
sense.
the
word
"olympic"
tending
to
cause
confusion,
to
cause
mistake,
to
deceive
or
to
falsely
suggest.
you
can
say
the
word
"olympic"
in
such
fashion
but
the
only
way
that
modifying
clause
makes
any
sense
is
as
referring
only
to
any
combination
or
simulation
thereof
tending
to
cause
confusion.
not
to
the
words
"olympic".
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
makes
sense?
i
am
not
talking
about
the
comma,
now.
you
think
it
makes
sense
to
say,
"the
word
"olympic"
tending
to
cause
confusion,
to
cause
mistake.
"
that
makes
sense
to
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
very
much
easier
way
to
get
to
that
result
is
simply
to
say
they
used
the
word
"olympic",
which
is
automatically
made
unlawful,
whether
it
tends
to
cause
confusion
or
not.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
about
the
separate
clause
that
the
corporation
shall
have
exclusive
right
to
use
the
words
"olympic",
"olympiad"
et
cetera
or
any
combination
thereof?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
they
have
also
said
the
hellenic
games.
they
were
sometimes
called
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
would
have
had
the
same
effect
on
those
you
were...
weren't
you
really
appealing,
not
the
ancient
games
but
the
modern
revival
of
the
ancient
games?
unknown
speaker
you
think
hellenic
games
would
have
done
just
as
well?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
only
because
of
the
united
states
olympic
committee.
it
was
no
more
powerful
in
the
public
domain
before
that
committee
than
was
the
phrase
"hellenic
games".
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
clear
up
this
one
thought
of
mine,
if
i
may?
unknown
speaker
if
one
reads
the
statute
the
way
justice
scalia
suggested,
rather
than
the
way
you
say,
with
the
words
4...
would
you
agree
that
the
statute
then
reads
directly
on
what
your
client
did?
i
mean,
in
other
words,
they
did
do
it
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
an
athletic
performance
or
promotion
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
statutory
predicate
for
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
just
to
be
sure
i
understand.
your
argument
is
that
because
congress
specified
remedies
comparable
to
those
that
are
provided
in
the
lanham
act,
it
follows
that
they
also
intended
to
incorporate
the
lanham
act
defenses?
unknown
speaker
are
you
relying
on
dollar
park
and
fly
for
the
proposition
that
a
generic
word
cannot
be
subject
to
that
sort
of
regulation
by
congress?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
a
statutory
case.
there
was
nothing
in
dollar
park
and
fly
that
said
congress
could
not
have
gone
that
far,
had
it
wanted
to,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
ms.
dunlap,
i'm
asking
a
question.
unknown
speaker
did
the
court's
opinion
in
dollar
park
and
fly
refer
to
any
constitutional
considerations
when
it
was
talking
about
the
generic--
unknown
speaker
--ms.
dunlap,
let
me
ask
you
on
this
point,
doesn't
it
make
a
difference
whether
you're
using
the
generic
term
analogously
or
whether
you're
using
it
literally?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
i
mean,
you
can
obviously
trademark
a
lot
of
generic
terms.
dove
soap,
if
you
consider
a
dove
just
a
species,
and
i'm
sure
you
could
make
it
bird
soap
and
that
would
be
trademarkable;
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
bird
is
a
genus.
unknown
speaker
bird
is
a
genus,
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
point.
unknown
speaker
it's
being
used
analogously.
you're
not
saying
"this
is
a
bird".
neither
is
the
olympic
committee
saying
"these
are
the
hellenic
games",
the
original
olympic
games.
it's
an
analogous
use
and
whenever
you
allow
a
trademark
use,
you
allow
such
analogous
use
of
generic
terms
sometimes.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
entirely
understand.
let
me
go
back
to
bird
soap
again.
you
can
trademark
something
"bird
soap"
but
you
couldn't
trademark
it
"soap
soap";
right?
it's
only
a
matter
of
taking
the
generic
term
and
using
it
literally;
right?
i
assume
you
could
not
trademark
something
called
"soap".
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
trademark
a
shoe
polish
named
"soap";
i
presume.
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
trying
to
focus
on
is
whether
"olympic"
is
being
used
in
that
analogous
sense,
in
the
sense
in
which
you
say
"bird
soap".
unknown
speaker
we
don't
expect
anybody
to
believe
these
are
the
real
olympics
but
it's
an
analogous
use,
or
is
it
being
used
in
the
literal
sense?
if
it
were
in
the
literal
sense,
i
might
agree
with
you
that
congress
can't
say
"the
only
thing
that
can
say
it's
an
"olympic"
is
this.
"
unknown
speaker
mr.
kester,
how
can
we
be
sure
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
incorporate
lanham
act
defenses?
unknown
speaker
you
think
remedies
doesn't
include
defenses?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
doing
something,
i
guess;
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
just
on
"olympic";
wasn't
it?
it
wasn't
on
all
of
the
words.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
how
would
recognition
of
a
"fair
use"
defense
defeat
the
goals
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
my
question
is...
i'm
sure
your
client
would
not
want
to
bother
with
lawsuits
but
putting
that
aside...
how
would
the
application,
the
proper
application
of
"fair
use"
defenses
defeat
congress'
purpose
and
intent?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
answer
is
that
in
this
case
the
application
of
"fair
use"
would
reach
the
same
result
or
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
my
inquiry
was
directed
at
what
congress
intended
when
it
referred
to
the
lanham
act
and
incorporated
the
remedies.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kester,
supposing
that
next
year
congress
were
to
get
a
report
from
a
presidential
commission
that
says
baseball
is
in
a
moribund
state
and
so
congress
passes
a
law
creating
the
united
states
baseball
commission
and,
among
other
things,
it
gives
the
commission
the
right
to
the
sole
use
of
the
word
"baseball",
is
that
strictly
a
statutory
matter?
any
constitutional
objection
to
that?
unknown
speaker
bringing
a
franchise
to
washington.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
more
and
more
realistic.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kester,
i
am
really
interested
in
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
supposing
they
did
just
as
he
said,
but
they
said,
of
course,
you
cannot
use
the
word
"baseball"
in
any
commercial
sense
to
promote
contests
and
the
like.
the
same
kind
of
language
you
have
here.
do
you
think
that
would
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
yes.
say
just
for
the
purposes
you
have
in
the
statute
here,
"to
induce
the
sale
of
any
goods
or
services,
to
promote
any
theatrical
exhibition,
athletic
performance
or
competition,
you
cannot
use
the
word
"baseball",
because
that
is
going
to
be
given
to
the
major
league
players
association.
"
,
or
something
like
that,
because
they
are
all
starving.
unknown
speaker
put
in
a
grandfather
clause.
unknown
speaker
just
talking
about
the
future.
you
can't
form
any
new
leagues
that
want
to
play
baseball
and
use
the
name
to
promote
it.
unknown
speaker
it's
pretty
popular
because
of
all
the
baseball
that
has
been
played
up
to
now;
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
serious
question.
do
you
think
that
would
be
constitutional?
and
if
so,
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
the
olympic--
unknown
speaker
--the
answer
is
no,
as
to
baseball?
unknown
speaker
and
the
difference
is
that
baseball
is
a
much
more...
a
word
of
more
general
application
than
"olympics".
"olympics"
had
a
much
more--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
the
difference
or
is
it
that--
unknown
speaker
--the
word
"baseball"
does
not
primarily
refer,
as
the
word
"olympic"
nowadays
primarily
refers
to
something
that
has
been
created
by
this
group
to
which
the
special
use
has
been
given?
unknown
speaker
it
primarily
refers
to
quite
something
else.
change
the
hypothetical
to
major
league
baseball.
they
could
give
a
monopoly
to
major
league
baseball.
unknown
speaker
no,
major
league
baseball.
unknown
speaker
make
the
statute,
just
substitute
the
words
"major
league
baseball"
for
"olympics"
wherever
it
appears.
unknown
speaker
to
the
major
leagues.
the
national
association--
unknown
speaker
--they
would
move
a
franchise
to
washington
and
one
to
new
orleans--
[laughter]
mr.
kester,
isn't
it
your
position
that
the
"olympics"
is
absolutely
different
from
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you
say
so?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
baseball
commission
and...
is
that
the
olympics
is
non-profit.
if
anybody
wants
to
say
that
baseball
is
non-profit,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this
is
a
form
of
subsidy
for
the
olympics;
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
not
inconceivable
that
the
government
would
want
to
subsidize
a
national
sport
of
some
kind?
they
do--
unknown
speaker
--that's
a
distinction
of
my
hypothetical.
i'm
not
sure
what
your
answer
is
on
major
league
baseball
yet.
unknown
speaker
there's
only
one
thing
called
major
league
baseball.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
pretty
close
to
yours.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
pretty
close.
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
say
yes?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
i
don't
remember
all
the
examples
judge
kozinski
had
in
his
dissent
but
things
like
"olympic
beer"
and
"olympic"
this
that
and
the
other
thing.
most
of
those,
i
guess,
are
saved
by
the
grandfather
clause.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
as
to
all
those,
i
take
it
under
the
statute
you,
in
effect,
by
just
not
suing,
you
have
consented
to
the
use.
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
position,
i
take
it,
if
somebody
in
a
town
named
olympic
wanted
to
open
an
olympic
laundry
or
a
laundromat
or
something,
you
would
have
the
right
to
stop
them
from
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
going
to
address
the
state
actor
issue
at
all,
mr.
kester?
unknown
speaker
was
that
issue
really
resolved
in
the
courts
below?
i
gather
it
wasn't.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
that
i
had
assumed
that
that
issue
was
open,
provided
we
were
to
determine
somehow
that
the
olympic
committee
is
a
state
actor.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
unknown
speaker
about
the
construction
of
the
statute.
supposing
a
cereal
manufacturer
wants
to
put
a
picture
of
a
gold
medal
winner
on
the
box
and
just
recite
on
it,
"winner
of
three
olympic
events",
"three
olympic
gold
medals",
you
could
prohibit
that;
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
using
the
word
"olympics",
yes.
unknown
speaker
no.
it's
for
a
commercial
purpose.
i'm
assuming
it
is
done
for
advertising.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
would
literally
apply
to
that
situation.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
newsworthiness
in
a
commercial?
i
don't
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
no.
the
cereal
manufacturer
wants
you
to
eat
my
cereal
and
you'll
be
as
good
an
athlete
as
mr.
so-and-so
who
won
three
olympic
games.
that
would
be
covered
by--
unknown
speaker
--"breakfast
of
olympic
champions",
for
example.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
my
example
is
clearly
covered,
too;
isn't
it?
i
mean,
seriously.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
it's
exactly
the
same
word,
"olympic",
in
a
commercial
thing
used
for
the--
unknown
speaker
--no.
i'm
saying
the
cereal
manufacturer
puts
a
picture
of
an
athlete
on
it
and
says,
"this
person
eats
this
cereal
and
he
won
three
olympic
gold
medals
in
the
last
olympics.
"
unknown
speaker
presumably;
yes.
my
question
is,
is
it
not
perfectly
clear
that
the
statute
gives
you
the
right
to
enjoin
that
use
of
the
word
"olympic"?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
may
not--
unknown
speaker
would
you
just
refresh
my
recollection.
what
if
you
do
win
on
state
action?
what
constitutional--
unknown
speaker
--say
we
agreed
with
him
on
the...
your
opponent...
on
the
first
amendment,
what
good
would
it
do
you
to
find
state
action?
unknown
speaker
but
why
would
we
need
a
trial
on
the
question
if
we
think
he's
right
on
the
first
amendment?
i'm
not
saying--
unknown
speaker
--you've
got
state
action
there.
congress
did
it.
you
don't
need
to
prove
these
people
are
state
actors.
unknown
speaker
you
still
haven't
explained
to
me
why
we
should
care
about
whether
there
is
state
action.
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
left
by
the
lower
court?
