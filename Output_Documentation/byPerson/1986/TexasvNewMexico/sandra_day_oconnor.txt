what?
you
started
to
say
and
were
interrupted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
payment
of
monetary
damages
in
lieu
of
water
itself
for
any
amount
found
overused
by
new
mexico?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
propose
that
or
object
to
payment
in
kind
in
water
below
to
the
master?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
did
you
suggest
if
the
master
wanted
to
impose
retroactive
relief
that
he
consider
monetary
damages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
master
conducted
a
hearing
on
this
very
question,
texas
had
a
burden
of
proof
and
submitted
whatever
it
was,
exhibit
number
79
or
whatever,
yes,
texas
exhibit
79,
which
purported
to
account
for
the
loss
in
water,
and
new
mexico
didn't
produce
anything
in
opposition,
and
the
master
made
his
decision.
what
is
the
matter
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
what
texas
put
on.
ne
mexico
put
on
nothing
of
its
own,
and
the
master
made
the
decision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hicks,
do
you
say
that
the
master
can
and
that
this
court
can
consider
the
equities
involved
in
ordering
any
relief
by
virtue
of
the
shortfall?
is
this
a
case
in
which
equities
can
be
considered
in
determining
what
is
to
be
done
about
the
shortfall?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
remedy
stage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
i
am
asking
whether
the
court
in
your
view
and
the
master
have
power
to
consider
the
equities
in
determining
the
remedies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
isn't
that
much
water
in
the
river.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
isn't
that
much
water
in
the
river.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean,
let's
suppose,
and
this
isn't
your
situation,
i
guess,
but
let's
suppose
that
we
have
existing,
preexisting
uses
in
new
mexico
and
land
being
farmed
for
many
generations,
and
dependent
upon
the
water,
and
we
have
land
in
texas
which
has
never
received
the
water
that
it
says
it
was
entitled
to
receive,
and
it
has
no
immediate
consequence
of
a
delay
in
receiving
the
shortfall.
now,
is
that
a
concern
that
we
can
be
considering
in
determining
what
to
do
about
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
we
had
some
residual
equitable
power
to
be
concerned
about
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
up
to
a
maximum
of
10,000
acres
ready
to
receive
it,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
monetary
damages
in
lieu
of
water
to
make
up
the
shortfall?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
has
a
value.
it
has
a
monetary
value.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
they
said
they
stipulated
that
the
master
had
that
power.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
master,
though,
as
i
read
him
in
his
recommendation,
thought
that
he
did
not
have
the
power,
and
i
really
read
him,
his
report
as
wishing
he
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
have
that
impression,
that
the
master
thought
he
just
lacked
the
power
to
consider
money
damages
but
wished
he
did?
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
theory
texas
had
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
texas
wasn't
the
claimant
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
how
it
was
handled
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
texas
didn't
shoulder
the
burden
of
proof
on
man's
activities.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
did
it
in
a
negative
sort
of
way.
you
said
here
are
the
natural
causes,
and
everything
else
has
to
be
a
fortiori
man's
activities?
