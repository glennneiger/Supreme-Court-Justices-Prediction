mr.
renea
hicks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
on
the
question
of
what
new
mexico
has
termed
retroactive
relief,
which
is
really
giving
texas
the
water
that
it
failed
to
deliver
over
all
those
years,
the
1983
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
has
already
settled
that
question.
new
mexico
has
offered
the
court
no
reason
to
revisit
that
decision.
in
1983,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
opinion,
the
court
returned
the
case
to
the
special
master
to
conclude
the
proceedings,
which
is
what
this
special
master
now
has
done,
and
said
determine
first...
there
are
two
subsidiary
questions
that
you
need
to
determine.
first,
for
each
year
of
the
period
in
dispute,
and
it
is
1950
to
1983,
under
the
1947
condition,
what
is
the
difference
between
the...
well,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
amount
of
water
new
mexico
is
supposed
to
deliver
under
the
1947
condition
and
the
amount
it
actually
delivered.
and
the
second
question
is,
to
what
extent
were
any
underdeliveries
under
that,
in
the
answer
to
that
question
due
to
man's
activities.
the
special
master
and
the
parties
have
spent
the
four
years
since
then
answering
these
questions,
and
new
mexico
has
asked
you
all
now
to
turn
that
into
nothing
but
a
very
expensive
academic
exercise
that
is
just
to
train
people
in
hydrology
or
something.
i
am
not
sure
why
they
want
it
that
way.
this
is
water
that
texas
bargained
for
in
the
compact
in
1950
or
in
1949
when
the
compact
was
approved
by
congress.
if
texas
had
wanted--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
want
to
give
the
careful
answer
to
that,
and
it
is
important.
this
is
compact
case,
not
an
equitable
apportionment
case.
and
in
determining
what
the
extent
of
the
shortfalls
is,
this
court...
there
are
no
equities
involved.
this
case
has
been
to
determine
those
amounts.
and
it
has
now
been
done.
mr.
renea
hicks
now,
at
the
remedy
stage
i
suppose
that
texas
could
have
tried
to
insist
that
it
is
our
water,
it
has
been
determined
that
it
is
our
water,
deliver
very
bit
of
it
right
now
in
new
mexico.
texas
has
not
chosen
to
push
that
issue.
mr.
renea
hicks
only
to
a
limited
extent.
there
is
a
realistic
geographical,
geological
limitation
on
how
much
can
come
down
in
one
year,
and
in
fact
how
much
can
be
used
in
one
year,
i
suppose.
if
all
340,000
acre
feet
came
down
in
one
year,
i
don't
think
it
could
happen,
first,
and
secondly,
if
it
did
you
would
wipe
out--
mr.
renea
hicks
--excuse
me?
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
right,
so
to
that
extent
the
equities
can
be
taken
into
account
in
ordering
the
relief.
the
equities,
i
think,
have
been
taken
into
account
in
the
recommendations
made
by
the
special
master.
he
gave
very
careful
consideration
to
those.
mr.
renea
hicks
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
renea
hicks
in
the
courts...
i
think
the
only
equitable
considerations
that
the
court
can
give
are
realistically
how
much
time
should
new
mexico
be
given
to
get
this
water
down
given
the
circumstances
in
the
basin,
and
it
isn't
the
individual
economic
circumstances
of
the
people
that
live
along
the
river,
because
you
have
to
remember
there
used
to
be
farmers
in
texas
farming
this
land.
after
the
compact
was
entered
the
water
has
essentially
quit
flowing.
they
still
do
some
farming.
they
are
there
and
ready
to
come
back.
there
is
testimony
to
that
effect.
so
any
harm
that
the
court
sees--
mr.
renea
hicks
--they
are
ready
to
receive
for
the
past,
the
payback,
the
debt,
34,000
acre
feet
a
year.
and
this
would
be
over
17
years,
essentially,
not
over
ten,
as
new
mexico
has
depicted
it.
on
top
of
that,
it
is
very
important
to
texas,
and
i
think
it
is
the
only
way
this
case
can
ever
end
is
that
there
be
an
injunction
against
new
mexico
for
the
future
to
abide
by
the
compact,
a
very
specific
injunction,
and--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
don't
think
the
compact
allows
that.
texas,
as
justice
scalia--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
water
in
the
west
is
a
unique
resource,
and--
mr.
renea
hicks
--it
is
very
difficult
to
determine,
and
when
you
begin
looking
over
34
years
of
failure
to
deliver,
the
hearing,
the
evidentiary
hearing
which
would
be
required
and
which
new
mexico
has
waited
until
after
the
proceedings
are
over
to
ask
for
so
that
it
would
further
delay
the
case,
the
hearing
would
be
extremely
complicated
to
determine
what
the
value
was
in
1950
of
the
water
they
failed
to
deliver,
the
water
in
'51,
in
'52,
the
consequential
damages
not
just
to
the
pecos
river
basin
in
texas
but
to
all
of
texas.
i
think
there
are
just
unbelievable
difficulties
in
that.
i
think--
mr.
renea
hicks
--but
it
may
be
worth
more,
too.
mr.
renea
hicks
and
i
think
the
observation
you
made
that
the
opportunity
at
the
end
of
this
case...
there
is
a
three-year
grace
period
under
the
recommendation
of
the
special
master.
there
is
an
opportunity
for
texas
and
new
mexico
to
negotiate,
to
substitute--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
wrote
the
letter
that
ms.
uram
read.
i
can
answer
the
question
that
way.
i
said
what
she
said.
i
suppose
everything
has
its
price.
that
is
what
economists
say.
and
i
don't
know
what
may
happen.
mr.
renea
hicks
it
is
higher
than
new
mexico
delivered.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record--
mr.
renea
hicks
--yes.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
mr.
renea
hicks
from
the
same
place,
i
suppose,
that
they
can
get
the
water
they
have
to
pay
back.
mr.
renea
hicks
you
can't
predict
exactly--
mr.
renea
hicks
--but
if
you
look
over
the
34-year
period--
mr.
renea
hicks
--it
would
average
10,000
feet
a
year
extra
in
addition
to
the
payback.
yes.
mr.
renea
hicks
but
it
is
really
difficult
to
tell,
but
they
have
the
same
sources
to
obtain
that
water
that
they
have
to
obtain
the
water
that
they
have
kept
from
us
all
these
years.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
they
will
have
to
do
it--
mr.
renea
hicks
--that's
right,
it
does
not.
these
numbers
are
computed,
by
the
way,
on
three-year
running
averages--
mr.
renea
hicks
--so
it
can
average
out
over
three
years
that
that...
it
is
hard
to
discuss
this
simply
and
make
any
sense
with
it.
that
10,000
acre
feet,
maybe
it
would
just
be
1,000
acre
feet
the
first
year.
it
may
be
12,000
acre
feet
the
next
year
and
3,000
acre
feet
the
next
year.
it
is
really...
it
is
hard
to
tell
in
advance
on
the
future
deliveries.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
mr.
renea
hicks
it
is
an
equitable
remedy,
but
i
don't
think
the
courts
that
order
specific
performance
in
contract
cases,
for
instance,
decide
how
long
you
have
to
pay
back
what
you
owe.
it
is
a
decision
that
equity
demands
specific
performance
in
this
case
because
of
the
particularly
unique
resource,
and
that
is
the
situation
here.
it
isn't
an
equitable
decision
to
say
new
mexico
has
50
years
to
pay
it
back.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
am
in
somewhat
of
a
box
here,
because
it
is
true,
just
as
a
realistic
matter
it
all
can't
come
down
in
one
year
and
we
don't
want
it
to
come
down
in
one
year.
we
couldn't
use
it.
the
farmers
there
couldn't
use
it.
as
much
as
farmers
in
the
west
would
take
any
kind
of
rain
they
can
get,
they
don't
want
it
all
at
once.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
think
what
i
just
said
is
a
good
example.
there
is
no
farmer
anywhere
in
the
west
that
would
turn
down
ten
good
years
of
rain
knowing
that
in
the
eleventh
year
they
may
not
get
as
much
rain,
and
that
is
the--
mr.
renea
hicks
--they
might
move
back
up
to
new
mexico
to
get
that
34,000
acre
feet
that
quit
coming
down.
i
don't
know.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
think
the
court
has
a
choice
on
that.
otherwise,
new
mexico
is
put
in
the
position
where
it
can
always
violate
the
compact
if
every
time
we
come
back
here
after
going
through
these
very
complicated
mathematical
formulas
to
get
the
answers
they
can
always
say,
but
it
isn't
economically
efficient
for
us
to
pay
it.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
think
that
as
you
suggested,
economic
reality,
if
it
is
all
that
difficult
and
all
that
inefficient,
i
am
not
an
economist,
but
the
theory
is--
mr.
renea
hicks
--that
there
is
a
price,
and
it
is
going
to
be
a
price
that
both
new
mexico
and
texas
somewhere
along
the
way
their
value
of
the
water--
mr.
renea
hicks
--in
his
recommended
decree
he
said
an
80
percent
level
for
good
faith.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
it
could
have
been
another
term,
but
i
think
he
just
used
good
faith.
i
don't
know
if
it
is
an
easy
term
to
use.
mr.
renea
hicks
but
he...
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
but--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
suppose
the
new
mexico
water
authority
person
could
be
put
in
jail
until
they
start
delivering
it,
but
he
could
be
in
jail
at
least
a
year.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
think
it
realistically
does
because
i
don't
think
anybody
in
new
mexico
realistically
expects
that
somebody
would
be
kept
in
jail
a
year
while
we
do
the
calculations
to
find
out
if
he
should
be,
and
i
just
don't
think
that
is
realistic,
and
i
think
that
is
what
new
mexico
has
counted
on
all
along
in
this
case,
go
be
quite
honest,
is
that
they
have
thought
that
when
the
judiciary's
back
is
against
the
wall
to
order
relief
in
this,
it
is
going
to
be
so
massive
in
their
view,
as
they
are
going
to
depict
it,
that
it
is
going
to
hurt
to
do
it,
and
the
court
is
going
to
see
that
and
say
let's
find
an
easier
way.
the
special
master
has
found
a
very
fair
way.
mr.
renea
hicks
the
future
compliance
question.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
they
would
be...
if
the
decree
were
entered
that
he
recommended,
they
would
under
an
injunction
to
vote
at
the
commission
meeting
for
the
formulas
that
they
have
stipulated
to.
mr.
renea
hicks
and
if
they
refuse
to
vote--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
suppose
we
could
say
hold
them
in
contempt,
please,
and
make
them
vote
that
way.
the
next
question
is,
can
you
make
them
turn
off
the
spigots
to
the
farms--
mr.
renea
hicks
--but
if
we
have
to
wait
so
long
texas
will
never
get
this
water.
it
will
be
a
few
years
until
we
can
find
out,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
wants
us
running
back
after
every
year
to
say
they
missed
it
by
a
little
bit,
hold
them
in
contempt.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
can't...
a
payback
in
money
is
much
easier
for
this
court
to
administer
and
for
everyone
to
administer.
i
don't
know
what
the
taxpayers
at
large
in
new
mexico
might
think
about
that,
and
i
don't
know
what
the
farmers
that
wouldn't
get
the
water
and
only
part
of
the
money
most
likely
in
texas
would
think
about
that,
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
renea
hicks
--the
difficulty
with
this
is,
new
mexico
waited
until
the
case
was
over
to...
it
didn't
even
raise
this
issue
until
it
wrote
a
brief
to
you
all
in
this
case.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
the
special
master
said
what
about
money,
and
we
all
scratched
our
heads
and
said
it
would
be
difficult,
and
nobody
said,
yes,
money.
new
mexico...
the
first
time
they
asked
was
after
the
case
is
over.
mr.
renea
hicks
but
they...
they
did--
mr.
renea
hicks
--but
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
renea
hicks
your
honor,
texas
in
some
sense
wishes
he
did.
that
is...
in
some
sense.
it
is
a
difficult
question.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
i
agree.
the
problem
with
that
is,
it
is
going
to
delay
texas
ever
getting
any
relief
by
at
least
five
years.
it
would
take
five
years
to
adjudicate
this,
i
am
convinced,
and
new
mexico
waited
until
the
end.
it
would
delay
further
for
a
reason
that
is
independent
of
the
two
states
in
a
way
that
would
only
harm
texas.
it
would
delay
our
relief
when,
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
ordered
that
water
be
repaid,
then
it
puts
for
the
next
three
years
while
new
mexico
is
getting
its
house
in
order
to
do
the
payback,
it
puts
us
in
a
position
where
each
state
has
to
begin
to
evaluate
how
much
is
it--
mr.
renea
hicks
--that
is
what
they
were
suppose
to
have
been
doing
for
the
last
34
years
and
they
haven't
done
it.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
disagree
with
your
evaluation
of
it.
i
don't
disagree
with
the
difficult
position
i
think
the
court
finds
itself
in
in
seeing
that
in
a
way
it
is
less
painless
to
give
money.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
know,
but
i
suspect
the
court
is
reluctant
to
order
a
state
to
disrupt--
mr.
renea
hicks
--on
the
question
about
who
is
entitled
to
the
water,
there
is
an
adjudication
that
has
gone
through
the
administrative
process
on
the
river
and
has
determined
who
has
the
water
rights
there,
so
that
settles
that
question.
as
to
the
money,
it
is
very
difficult
to
determine,
because
in
a
sense
it
is
because
of
all
the
consequential
damage
questions.
does
the
fact
that
the
farmers--
mr.
renea
hicks
--excuse
me?
mr.
renea
hicks
it
would
be...
another
problem
with
this
is,
i
think
it
would
be
so
much
money
that
new
mexico
couldn't
pay
it.
it
would
bankrupt
new
mexico.
mr.
renea
hicks
these
days
we
would
love
to
have
it,
and
don't
think
there
hasn't
been
a
debate
in
the
state
government
about
this
issue.
there
has
been.
mr.
renea
hicks
this
is...
i
don't
know.
i
simply
don't
how
how
this
would
be
done.
it
would
be
like
one
of
the
most
complicated
class
action
distributions
you
can
imagine.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
agree...
i
don't
disagree
with
any
of
these
speculations.
it
is
just
that
i
don't
see
what
standards
the
court
has
about
it.
i
think
if
the
pressure
is
put
on
through
the
order
of
the
repayment
of
water,
as
the
compact
requires--
mr.
renea
hicks
--that
also
is
difficult,
because
i
think
this
court
had
to
hear
a
constitutional
case
on
the
way
that
was
distributed.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
want
in
the
short
amount
of
time
i
have--
mr.
renea
hicks
--it
would
be
no
trouble.
i
have
a
fear
that
my
paycheck
won't
be
coming
in
september
if
the
deficit
continues.
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
hearing
on
man's
activities,
which
is
the
second
crucial
issue
new
mexico
raises,
it
is
clear
there
was
a
hearing
on
man's
activities.
it
could
not
be
clearer
in
the
record.
the
special
master
in
a
discussion
with
the
attorney
for
new
mexico
at
the
conclusion
of
all
these
hearings
on
may
21st
observed
to
that
counsel
that
he
had
told
them
over
a
year
ago
of
how
this
particular
exhibit,
79,
the
crucial
exhibit,
would
be
treated,
how
he
viewed
its
working,
and
exhibit
79
is
kind
of
the
end
of
an
evolutionary
process,
because
the
parties
exchanged
documents,
as
new
mexico
says
in
its
brief,
the
precursors
to
this
exhibit,
for
a
year
before
the
final
hearing.
new
mexico
was
on
notice.
on
may
22nd
of
1985
the
special
master
entered
an
order
that
in
paragraph
7
said
in
november
there
is
going
to
be
a
hearing
on
man's
activities,
and
there
was
a
hearing
in
november
on
man's
activities.
mr.
renea
hicks
the
special
master's
recommendations
are
that
you
find
that
texas
met...
shouldered
the
burden
of
proof
and
met
it,
and
it
did.
there
is
testimony
to
that
effect.
new
mexico's
real
complaint
is
that
it
failed
to
put
on
any
evidence
and
it
wants
a
second
chance.
it
had
the
opportunity.
it
was
on
notice
and
it
did
nothing.
i
don't
know
why
it
did
nothing.
mr.
renea
hicks
it
did
have
the
opportunity
in
november.
that
is
when--
mr.
renea
hicks
--no,
november
18th
and
19th
and
december
3rd
and
4th
were
the
days
of
the
hearings
on
the
causes
of
depletions,
all
of
the
causes
of
depletions,
man's
activities,
natural
causes,
and
also
the
legal
adjustments
that
had
to
be
made.
the
parties
went
out
as
the
record
demonstrates,
and
we
spent
all
day
on
december
18th
reaching
agreement
on
numerous
technical
matters
that
have
to
do
with
the
man's
activities
question,
and
we--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
don't
think
texas
had
the
burden
of
proof.
i
think
the--
mr.
renea
hicks
--texas
was
the
claimant,
but
i
think
the
burden
of
proof
on
man's
activities
should
shift
to
new
mexico,
but
i
think
the
court
doesn't
have--
mr.
renea
hicks
--no.
mr.
renea
hicks
no.
texas
did...
what
i
was
going
to
say
is,
texas
did
shoulder
the
burden
of
proof,
notwithstanding
its
view
that
it
didn't
have
to.
it
shouldered
the
burden
of
proof--
mr.
renea
hicks
--that
is
true,
and
there
is
no
other
way
to
do
it.
what
new
mexico
wants
is
something
that
is
irrelevant
under
the
compact,
and
that
is,
it
wants
not
a
generic
determination
of
whether
man's
activities
caused
the
depletions,
which
is
what
texas
did
through
exhibit
79.
what
it
wants
is
to
be
able
to
trace
each
activity
of
man
to
its
origin,
to
see
if
farmer
jones
when
he
irrigated
his
alfalfa
crop
caused
x
amount
of
depletion.
that
is
irrelevant
under
the
compact.
it
might
be
helpful
to
new
mexico
in
deciding
how
it
wants
to
readjust
the
flows
to
texas.
it
might
be
helpful
to
determine
that,
but
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
proceeding
before
this
court.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
that
is
what
this
problem
about
unknowns
is.
it
is
like
a
sinister
force
or
something.
there
is
no...
it
has
to
be
either
nature
or
man's
activities.
new
mexico...
texas
has
proven
that
it
is
man's
activities.
new
mexico
in
essence
really
wants
to
say
it
is
this
activity
of
man.
mr.
renea
hicks
that
is
proof.
mr.
renea
hicks
no,
because
our
proof
was,
we
have
take
care
of
every
known
natural
cause
that
there
is.
in
fact,
it
is
all
based
on
stipulations.
and
there
is
nothing
left
by
logic
except
human
causes,
and
that
is
not
a
failure
of
proof.
that
is
a
proof.
it
is
the
way
a
lot
of
things
are
proved.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
wrong
with
it.
there
is
no
other
way
to
ever
have
this
compact
work
except
that
way.
i
don't
think
it
is
at
all
improper.
on
the
water
interest
i
wanted
to
mention
that
the
water
interest,
if
new
mexico
fails
to
act
in
good
faith
as
defined
under
the
special
master's
recommended
decree,
the
water
interest
does
not
run
on
the
whole
340,100
acre
feet.
it
runs
on
the
undelivered
balance
remaining,
and
it
also
never
starts
running
until
at
least
12
years--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
am
sorry,
it
there
is
any
shortfall--
mr.
renea
hicks
--yes,
the
future...
for
the
future
there
is
no
interest
running,
so
texas...
the
equities,
i
think,
in
terms
of
delivery
of
the
payback,
the
equities
have
been
so
fairly
balanced.
texas
doesn't
get
any
interest
if
new
mexico
acts
in
good
faith.
it
is
only
a
contingent
interest.
even
if
they
get
interest
it
doesn't
start
running
until
12
years
after
the
last
adjudicated
violation.
on
top
of
that,
new
mexico
has
known
for
at
least
13
years
since
the
litigation
began
that
texas
is
challenging
what
they
have
done,
and
they
have
taken
absolutely
no
steps
to
adjust
the
activities
along
that
river.
their
chief
water
authority
testified
that
he
wouldn't
do
it
unless
you
all
ordered
him
to.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
think
the
average
flow
is
approximately
75,000
acre
feet
over
the
last
30
years,
and
this
would
increase
it
on
an
average
of
10,000--
mr.
renea
hicks
--so
one-seventh.
mr.
renea
hicks
that
is
true.
mr.
renea
hicks
it
should
be
because
it
would
then
be
the
river
that
we
bargained
for.
it
wouldn't
be
the
river
as
new
mexico
has
configured
it
for
the
last
34
years.
that
is
the
reason
it
is
so
important
for
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
not
an
equitable
apportionment
case
but
a
compact
case.
if
texas
had
come
before
the
court
in
1920,
as
it
started
to,
and
sought
an
equitable
apportionment,
and
let's
say
the
order
had
been
entered
that
would
divide
the
river
up
as
we
ultimately
did
in
the
compact,
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
right
now
about
is
it
fair
to
new
mexico
to
have
to
pay
back
water
it
withheld.
what
you,
justice
white,
are
comparing
the
situation
in
the
future
to
if
they
have
to
comply
with
the
compact
is
to
a
situation
where
they
weren't
complying
with
the
compact.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
understand.
i
guess
i
got
too
involved
in
the
argument.
i
have
no
further--
