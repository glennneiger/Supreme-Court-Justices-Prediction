justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
new
mexico
accepts
the
determination
of
the
shortage--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
the
shortfall?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
that
be
determined?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
would
the
interest
rate
be
applied
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do?
you
say
10
percent
of
320,000
or
so
many
acre
feet?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
interest
would
be
paid
in
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
in
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
suppose
we
said
prospective
relief
is
all
you
can
get,
and
then
new
mexico
promptly
doesn't
deliver
the
water
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
are
back
in
court,
and
you
say
only
prospective
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
would
you
get
the
water
to
deliver
this
extra
amount?
would
you
have
to
condemn
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't
have
to
if
you
went
out
and
condemned
some
other
water
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
would
only
cost
you
money,
but
then
you
would
be
taking
the
water
away
from
maybe
even
priority
users.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
will
benefit
from
the
water,
the
increased
water
usage?
suppose
you
delivered
the
extra
34,000
acre
feet
a
year
into
texas.
is
that
water
distributed
according
to
a
water
system
in
texas,
priority?
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
municipalities
in
texas?
do
they
need
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
will
only
have
the
extra
water
for
ten
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
two
states
have
had
a
chance
to
settle
this
controversy
over,
i
don't
know,
forever.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
been
able
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
even
if
the
contract
contemplates
specific
performances,
so
to
speak,
it
would
be
inequitable
to
order
it
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he
said
i
don't
have
any
authority
about
damages.
but
did
you
say
that...
did
you
make
this
argument
that
nobody
knew
what
this
obligation
was
until
recently?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fundamental
argument
that
went
on
for
so
many
years
when
judge
brightenstein
was
special
master
was,
what
was
the
1947
condition.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
a
major
difference
between
you
two
states,
and
that
question
came
up
here
twice,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
found
that
they
weren't
due
to
natural
causes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
then
say,
well,
those
weren't
due
to
natural
causes,
now
let's
have
a
hearing
to
decide
what
they
were
due
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
one
of
the
possibilities
other
than
man
if
it
isn't
nature?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
a
third
category,
unknown?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
conditions.
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's
what
the
french
say,
too.
but
the
annual...
forget
amount
the
damages
or
forget
about
the
payback.
the
amount
that
you
are
supposed
to
deliver
under
the
compact,
that
was
increased
over,
well,
the
340...
the
annual
delivery
is
higher
than
new
mexico
thought
it
was
by
about
what,
10,000
acre
feet?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
let's
take
it
that
way.
they
are
going
to
have
to,
even
without
the
payback
they
are
going
to
have
to
send
more
water
down
than
they
have
been
delivering.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
they
are
going
to
have
to
get
that
somewhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
are
they
going
to
get
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
special
master
say
that
is
about
10,000
acre
feet?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
know,
but
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
are
going
to
have
to
start
doing
that
right
away,
aren't
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
--as
soon
as
we
affirm
the
special
master
if
we
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
three-year
grace
period
doesn't
apply
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
34,000
acre
feet
a
year
for
ten
years
and
then
you
won't
have
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
have
to
go
on
to
oregon.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
the
special
master
has
got
some...
for
some
things
they
are
going
to
have
to
determine
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
good
faith.
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
is
possible
to
determine
good
faith,
then
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
say
that
anybody
who
isn't
in
good
faith
is
going
to
be
held
in
contempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
wrong
with...
there
is
some
way
of...
there
is
certainly
some
way
of
enforcing
an
injunction
besides
giving
water,
giving
more
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
that
has
any
force
at
all?
that
is
usually
the
way
courts
enforce
injunctions.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
remedy
what
does
the
special
master
recommend
as
a
remedy
if
the
state
of
new
mexico
just
doesn't
deliver
the
underlying
annual
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
15
years
from
now
new
mexico
has
paid
back
all
the
shortfall,
and
then
it
just
begins
not
to
deliver
the
annual
amount
that
the
decree
calls
for.
what
is
the
remedy
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
those
are
the
normal
ways
to
enforce
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
if
the
payback
were
not
in
water
but
in
money,
then
you
would
be
starting
out
now
from
the
point
i
hypothesized
of
15
years
later,
and
new
mexico
would
just
have
the
obligation
to
pay
the
annual
amount
and
if
it
didn't,
you
would
have
to
find
some
way
of
enforcing
the
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
would
know
what
they
had
thought
about
it
if
they
had
the
choice
of
either
doing
it
the
way
the
special
master
recommends
or
paying
an
amount
of
damages
that
the
special
master
might
recommend.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
master
said
he
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
wouldn't
have
any
tougher
time
distributing
money
than
you
would
the
water.
how
do
you
know
who
is
entitled
to
this
water?
what
would
you
do
with
the
money
if
you
got
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
any
shortfall
on
the
1947
condition
delivery,
interest
doesn't
run
on
that,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume--
justice
byron
r.
white
--by
what
percentage
did
the
determination
of
the
amount
owed
under
the
compact
each
year
under
the
'47
condition,
by
how
much
will
that
increase
the
flow
at
the
state
line?
by
what
percentage?
half?
how
much--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
on
10,000
acre
feet.
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
if
you
add
on
top
of
that
adding
34,000
acre
feet
a
year,
34,000
acre
feet
isn't
far
from
half
of
the
average
annual
flow.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
add
ten
onto
that,
so
you
are
going
to
be...
it
is
going
to
be
quite
a
different
river,
isn't
it,
at
the
state
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
making
an
argument.
i
am
just
asking
for
information.
