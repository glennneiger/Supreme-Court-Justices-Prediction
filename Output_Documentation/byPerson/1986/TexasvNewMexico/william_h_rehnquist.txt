chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
65
original,
texas
versus
new
mexico.
ms.
uram,
you
on
behalf
of
new
mexico,
i
understand,
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
your
conclusion
from
that
that
you
shouldn't
have
to
pay
it
back
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
good
is
a
compact
like
this
if,
you
know,
you
and
texas
enter
into
an
agreement
that
says
you
will
only
use
a
certain
amount
of
water
coming
down
the
pecos,
and
in
fact
new
mexico
uses
what
it
probably
in
good
faith
things
it
has
a
claim
to
but
which
later
a
master
interpreting
the
contract
says,
no,
you
didn't
have
a
claim
to.
do
you
say,
well,
we
will
just
kiss
and
make
up,
and
from
now
on
we
will
obey
the
compact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
considerable
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
excuse
me.
it
doesn't
have
to--
--that
is
true
about
a
requirements
contract
or
lots
of
other
kinds
of
things
that
aren't
in
the
area
of
interstate
compact.
someone
agrees
to
take
all
of
his
requirements.
now,
there
may
be
arguments
what
those
requirements
are.
ultimately
a
court
may
tell
that
person,
your
requirements
were
different
than
you
thought
they
were,
but
the
contract
would
nonetheless
be
enforced,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
what
justice
o'connor
was
asking.
you
are
asking
us
to...
you
are
asking
now
to
have
damages
given
rather
than
water.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
ordinarily
if
you
breach
an
agreement
you
don't
look
so
much
at
the
hardship
of
the
other
party
as
the
value
of
the
performance
of
the
person
who
breached.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
specific
performance
is
a
form
of
equitable
relief
and
it
simply
require
you
to
do
what
you
said
you
would
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
make
to
the
special
master
this
argument
that
the
compact
didn't
contemplate
what
you
call
retroactive
relief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
did
the
special
master
say
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
uram.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
hicks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
claim
on
the
part
of
individual
landowners
to
this
money,
or
can
texas
just
plant
a
bunch
of
tree
farms
over
around
marshall
with
it
if
they
want
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
didn't
have
the
opportunity
in
november,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
master
said,
we
are
just
going
to
hear
kind
of
oral
argument
from
lawyers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hicks.
the
case
is
submitted.
