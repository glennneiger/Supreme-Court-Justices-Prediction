and
usually
aren't
equitable
considerations
appropriate
in
connection
with
the
remedy
of
specific
performance?

well,
i
take
it
the
master's
time
table,
the
three

and
all
the
rest
of
it,
smacks
somewhat
of
equitable
considerations,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
be
a
lot
of
money,
would
it?
