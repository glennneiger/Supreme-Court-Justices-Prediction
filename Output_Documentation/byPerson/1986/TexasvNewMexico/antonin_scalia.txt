justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
call
this
retroactive
relief?
i
find
that
a
curious
terminology
for
this.
in
that
sense
any
relief
in
an
ordinary
contract
claim
you
would
consider
to
be
retroactive
relief?
you
break
a
contract
with
me
and
i
sue
you
for
the
breach,
for
the
damages
that
i
have
suffered.
you
would
consider
that
retroactive
relief?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
even
say
the
same
in
a
contracts
case.
i
mean,
sometimes
you
don't
know
definitely
what
your
obligation
was
until
there
is
a
lawsuit
and
the
court
tells
you
precisely
what
it
was.
but
you
had
it.
it
was
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see...
well,
with
due
respect,
ms.
uram,
it
is
just
like
saying,
if,
you
know,
somebody's
dog
bites
me
and
i
try
to
sue
and
you
say,
well,
you
know,
you
will
get
relief,
we
will
prevent
him
from
biting
you
again.
that
is
not
relief
for
the
first
bite.
you
are
saying
here
the
first
bite
is
free.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
really
understand
this
point
about
new
mexico
not
knowing
what...
new
mexico
is
supposed
to
be
pouring
water
into
the
river
if
the
level
isn't
at
a
proper
flow.
the
requirement
was
very
simple.
don't
take
any
water
out
of
it
by
man's
activities.
wasn't
that
the
sum
total
of
the
requirements
imposed
on
new
mexico?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
as
far
as
new
mexico's
obligations
were
concerned,
what
obligations
did
new
mexico
have
other
than
not
to
take
away
from
the
river
by
man's
activities
any
more
than
had
been
taken
away
by
man's
activities
in
1947?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
don't.
all
you
have
to
do
is
conduct
no
additional
man's
activities
after
1947.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
asked
that
he
do
so
instead
of
giving
water
relief?
you
may
have
stipulated
that
he
had
authority
to
do
so,
but
did
you
ask
that
instead
of
giving
water
relief,
he
give
monetary
relief?
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
they
are
going
to
use
it
for,
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
they
wouldn't
accept
a
certain
amount
of
money
for
the
water
instead.
i
mean,
there
is
no
reason
you
can't
get
out
of
this
by
paying
money.
it
is
just
a
question
of
whether
you
are
going
to
have
to
buy
the
water
from
texas
or
whether
the
special
master
is
going
to
have
to
figure
out
how
much
a
foot
acre
of
water
is.
did
texas
stipulate
to
damages
if
the...
or
did
they
oppose...
they
want
water
rather
than
money.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
wouldn't
accept
any
kind
of...
any
amount
of
money
for
that
water?
that
is
hard
to
believe.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
very
irrational
behavior.
not
many
economists
would
think
that
that
is
a
possible
scenario.
of
course,
you
can
still
settle
monetarily,
whatever
we
do
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
just
what
i
can't
believe.
i
mean,
i
don't
care
how
much
water
they
are
getting.
i
am
sure
they
will
accept
a
monetary
settlement
for
the
water.
it
may
have
been
in
texas's
economic
interest
to
get
a
water
judgment
first
and
then
have
new
mexico
bargain
with
texas
about
how
much
new
mexico
will
pay
instead
of
the
water,
but
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
texas
would
behave
so
irrationally
as
not
to...
if
in
fact
the
water
is
worth
more
to
you
than
to
them,
i
am
sure
they
would
come
to
an
economic
adjustment
in
dollars.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
needed
that
affirmative
evidence,
would
there
have
been
any
need
to
compute
the
1947
flow.
what
was
the
purpose
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why?
i
mean,
if
each
of
man's
activities
has
to
be
proven,
you
are
wasting
time
to
go
pack
and
figure
out
what
the...
the
whole
purpose
of
computing
the
'47
flow
was
to
see
if
there
is
any
decrease
from
that
flow,
and
in
order...
and
when
you
find
a
decrease
you
then
find
what
was
naturally
caused,
and
the
rest
is
man's
activities.
otherwise
you
are
going
to
have
to
show
man's
activities
diverted
so
much
water
this
year,
man's
activities
diverted
so
much
water
the
next
year.
if
that
must
be
proven,
you
have
wasted
a
whole
lot
of
time
figuring
out
anal
the
'47
flow
was,
haven't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
i
am
not
making
myself...
why
do
you
need
that...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
said
that
what
texas
has
to
show
is
that
man's
activities
diverted
so
many
acre
feet
of
water
each
year.
if
texas
has
to
show
that,
what
difference
does
it
make
what
the
1947
flow
was?
you
are
wasting--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
don't
need
a
standard.
if
you
have
to
prove
each
individual
man's
diversion
one
by
one,
you
don't
need
a
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
purpose
of
the
standard
is
to
figure
out
what
the
natural
flow
of
the
river
was,
and
then
you
can
deduct
from
that
standard
whatever
natural
diversions
had
occurred
in
the
interim
and
all
the
rest
would
be
man's
activities.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it
doesn't
really
solve
that
problem,
because
in
fact
giving
you
however
many
hundred
thousand
acre
feet
of
water
in
1995
is
not
the
same
as
giving
you
the
same
number
in
1933.
it
may
be
worth
much
more
in
1995
than
it
was
in
1932.
i
mean,
superficially
it
looks
as
though
the
fairest
way
is
to
give
you
the
water
you
didn't
get,
but
in
fact
when
you
didn't
get
it
back
in
1952
it
may
not
have
been
worth
nearly
what
it
is
going
to
be
worth
when
you
finally
do
get
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
wondering
about
that.
i
thought
texans
had
had
sort
of
a
reputation
of
being
enterprising,
let's
cut
a
deal
kind
of
folks,
and
have
you
really
said
that
you
would
not,
no
matter
what,
you
want
the
water
and
you
won't
take
any
kind
of
money
for
the
water?
that
seems--
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
not
economically
very
efficient,
to
tell
new
mexico
farmers
who
will
be
able
to
use
it
after
the
payoff
is
done
that
they
have
to
get
out
and
come
back
15
years
later,
or
whenever
the...
17
years
later,
okay,
and
to
tell
texas
farmers
you
can
come
in
and
farm
for
ten
years
but
you've
got
to
know
you
can
set
up
this
farm
but
after
ten
years
there
is
just
not
going
to
be
water
for
it.
that
just
isn't
very
efficient
and
i
wouldn't...
i
frankly
wouldn't
favor
it
if
i
didn't
think
that
if
it
is
that
senseless
it
wouldn't
be
economically
favorable
for
the
two
of
you
to
get
together
and
work
it
out
in
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
could
make
up
a
money
figure.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
you
would
be
getting...
the
river
would
be
coming
up
to
the
47
agreement
immediately.
i
mean,
that
part
of
all
of
this
would
be
affirmed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but
the
level
would
now
be
established
and
that
would
be
squared
away.
you
might
be
getting
the
money
payment...
let's
assume
you
get
the
money
payment
five
years
from
now,
but
you
would
get
it
all
at
once.
you
can
consume
all
the
money
at
once.
you
can't
consume...
the
water,
the
final
water
payment
you
say
won't
be
in
until
17
years.
maybe
you'd
rather
have
all
the
money
in
five
rather
than
the
water
trickled
out,
so
to
speak,
over
17
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it
is
too
much
money,
of
course,
they
could...
i
guess
new
mexico
could
offer
to
sell
you
water
from
the
pecos
river
instead.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
may
have
put
it
that
way
but
i
think
their
real
complaint
was
not
that
there
was
not
a
hearing,
but
that
the
hearing
was
not
one
at
which
the
master
said,
okay,
show
me
what
man's
activities
have
taken
out
of
the
river.
rather,
the
hearing
was
one
in
which
he
said,
you
show
me
why
when
you
deduct
all
the
natural
diversions
from
the
original
flow
everything
else
isn't
man's
activities.
it
is
really
a
burden
of
proof
complaint
they
have,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't
prove
anything
unless
you
proved
it
in
the
1947
assessment,
because
all
you
came
in
and
proved
was
the
natural
causes
that
you
know
of,
but
the
natural
causes
that
you
know
of,
but
the
natural
causes...
that
is
nonproof.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
hadn't
put
on
any
natural
causes.
then
you
would
have
proven
even
more
man's
activities,
wouldn't
you?
