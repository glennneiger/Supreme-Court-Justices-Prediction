ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
heart
of
the
current
controversy
under
the
pecos
river
compact
lies
in
two
issues.
first,
whether
the
court
may
decide
the
critical,
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case,
did
man's
activities
in
new
mexico
cause
all
or
part
of
the
shortfall
at
the
state
line
on
the
basis
of
inference
or
presumption?
ms.
charlotte
uram
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
charlotte
uram
the
master
found
that
there
were
340,000
acre
feet
departure.
we
do
not
take
exception.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
court
should
order
new
mexico
to
pay
in
the
future
water
in
excess
of
its
compact
obligation
to
make
up
for
a
shortfall
from
1950
to
1983
when
new
mexico's
obligation
was
unknown.
as
justice
white
pointed
out
to
the
court
the
master
did
recommend
a
340,000
acre
foot
shortfall
be
determined
here.
we
take
no
exception
to
that.
what
new
mexico
does
take
exception
to
is
that
the
master
recommended
that
that
entire
amount
of
shortfall
be
presumed
or
inferred
due
to
man's
activities
in
new
mexico.
new
mexico
also
takes
exception
to
the
master's
proposal
for
relief.
the
master
proposed
actually
four
items
for
relief.
first,
he
proposed
that
there
be
prospective
relief,
and
we
do
not
take
exception
to
that.
that
is
required
under
the
compact.
but
then
he
went
on
to
propose,
to
recommend
that
new
mexico
also
be
required
to
pay
water
and
to
pay
in
water
for
shortfalls
from
1950
to
1983.
he
recommended
that
new
mexico
be
required
to
pay
that
amount
of
water
in
a
maximum
time
period
of
13
years
when
the
shortfalls
accrued
over
a
34-year
period.
and
finally,
he
recommended
that
the
court
order
new
mexico
to
pay
water
interest
at
treasury
bill
rates
if
new
mexico
falls
too
far
short.
ms.
charlotte
uram
he
said
it
was
to
be
determined
according
to
the
treasury
bill
rate
on
the
day
when
new
mexico
is
found
to
be--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--it
would
be
applied
to
the
340,000
acre
foot
amount,
whatever
had
been
short.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
established
a
system
in
which--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--the
interest
would
be
paid--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--in
water.
it
would
be
an
interest
payment
in
water
that
he
recommended.
and
new
mexico
takes
exception
to
not
the
prospective
relief
but
all
aspects
of
the
retroactive
relief.
ms.
charlotte
uram
no,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
this
case
is
different,
and
we
do
use
the
word
"retroactive"
with
the
intention
of
pointing
out
that
new
mexico's
obligation,
exactly
what
that
amount
of
water
is,
is
not
known
until
man's
activities
are
determined
by
this
court.
so
at
that
point
we
will
know
the
obligation.
it
is
as
if--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--that
may
very
well
be,
your
honor.
we
are
not...
it
doesn't
matter
whether
one
calls
it
retroactive
or
something
else.
the
point
is
that
we
are
being
asked
to
pay
back
water
for
shortfalls
that
occurred
over
34
years.
new
mexico
did
not
know
its
obligation
at
that
time.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
should
not
have
to
pay
back
any
water
under
the
compact.
ms.
charlotte
uram
i
understand
the
court's
difficulty.
but
the
compact
is--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--well,
the
compact
does
provide
relief,
and
the
compact
specifically
provided
this
prospective
relief
for
two
reasons,
and
that
prospective
relief
is
real,
your
honor.
the
foundation
of
the
question
of
what
good
is
this
compact
is
the
assumption
that
there
is
no
relief
unless
there
is
relief
for
past
water
due.
ms.
charlotte
uram
the
relief
is
future
water.
in
this
case,
for
example--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--well,
then
new
mexico--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--that
may
be
a
different
point,
your
honor.
at
that
point
it
is
possible
that
the
court
could
order
different
relief,
but
at
this
point
the
compact
does
not
permit
it.
ms.
charlotte
uram
let
me
sort
out
the
stages,
and
perhaps
we
will
see
that
it
is
not
a
bite.
there
are
two
stages
that
one
is
concerned
with
under
the
compact.
the
first
stage
is
the
one
that
the
court
is
now
approaching.
what
is
new
mexico's
obligation?
that
is
the
first
stage.
the
compacting
parties
have
specifically
considered
whether
at
that
stage
they
should
provide
for
retroactive
relief
for
debit-credit
accounting,
and
they
said
no.
they
said
no
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
they
felt
that
they
wanted
to
leave
the
compact
flexible
to
accommodate
change
in
the
future,
and
so
when
they
selected
a
method
which
required
such
complicated
analysis,
they
said,
we
don't
know
enough
about
this
river.
this
is
an
extremely
difficult
river.
let
us
leave
it
open
in
the
future
to
change,
to
correction
of
the
method,
to
replacement
of
the
system
to
more
accurately
define
the
obligation.
and
if
we
tie
it
to
a
debit-credit
system
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
parties,
it
will
make
it
very
difficult
for
the
parties
to
make
the
changes
that
are
required
that
should
happen
in
the
future
in
this
dynamic
compact.
so
that
was
the
first
reason
that
they
said
when
we
are
arriving
at
new
mexico's
obligation
in
the
first
instance,
when
we
are
trying
to
define
man's
activities,
when
we
are
coming
to
that
point,
in
that
instance
there
will
not
be
retroactive
relief,
and
they
had
a
second
reason
which
is
related
to
the
first.
that
second
reason
is
that
new
mexico
cannot
know
exactly
what
its
obligation
is
until
the
obligation
is
determined
in
light
of
the
man's
activities
finding.
it
cannot
know
in
advance
exactly
what
that
amount
of
water
will
be.
so
there
is
no
wrong.
there
is
no
wrong--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--yes,
and
there
is
enforcement
here,
and
that
enforcement
is
prospective
at
this
point.
at
a
later
point
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
compact
which
we
do
not
have
here,
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
compact,
perhaps
other
relief
would
be
appropriate.
ms.
charlotte
uram
well,
the
requirement
is
actually
quite
complicated,
justice
scalia.
it
is
not
simple
to
administer
and
it
is
not
simple
to
know.
that
is
why
this
litigation
has
taken
so
long.
it
is
according
to
the
depletions
as
it
appeared
on
the
river
in
1947.
that
is
the
first
step.
you
have
to
determine
the
depletion
on
the
river
as
it
occurred
in
1947.
the
second
step
is,
you
have
to
determine
by
a
fairly
complicated
inflow,
outflow
method
the
second
step,
the
extent
to
which
there
were
shortfalls.
and
then
there
is
the
third
step,
which
is
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case,
the
issue
that
sets
new
mexico's
obligation,
and
that
is
to
what
extent
did
man's
activities
in
new
mexico
cause
the
departure.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that
is
the
obligation,
but
to
do
that
you
have
to
go
through
fairly
complicated
mathematical--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
correct,
because
the
standard
is
not
tied
to
uses
in
new
mexico
in
1947.
in
other
words,
new
mexico
cannot
maintain
all
of
the
uses
that
it
had
on
the
river
in
1947.
it
is
tied
to
depletions
which
had
appeared
on
the
river,
and
rivers,
particularly
this
river,
which
is
tied
to
two
separate
aquifer
systems,
don't
show
depletions
right
away.
it
takes
a
while
for
the
water
to
get
there,
and
different
rainfalls
may
cause
different
effects,
and
changing
where
a
well
is
located
may
cause
different
effects.
so
it
is
not
as
simple
as
it
sounds.
as
a
factual
matter
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
know
exactly
how
much
water
you
need,
exactly
what
you
need
to
do
to
remain
in
compliance
with
the
standard.
and
i
would
point
out,
justice
scalia,
in
light
of
your
concern,
didn't
new
mexico
know
and
didn't
new
mexico
do
what
it
needed
to
do,
the
answer
is
that
in
1961
and
'62,
when
this
commission
made
findings,
new
mexico
believed
that
it
was
in
compliance
according
to
those
commission
findings,
and
so
it
did
continue
to
administer
the
river
according
to
the
commission
findings
at
that
period.
it
regulated
all
uses.
it
didn't
let
people
make
new
uses
which
would
have
an
effect
on
the
river.
it
took
all
those
steps
in
order
to
assure
that
it
would
remain
in
compliance
with
the
commission
findings.
ms.
charlotte
uram
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
charlotte
uram
the
language
is
in
senate
document
number
109
at
pages...
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
124--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--it
is
stipulated
exhibit
1
in
this
case.
ms.
charlotte
uram
i
don't
know
if
exhibit
1
is
in
the
volumes
that
are
before
the
court,
but
it
should
have
been
transmitted
to
the
court
as
part
of
the
record.
ms.
charlotte
uram
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
it
is
at--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--it
is
pages
124
and
125.
ms.
charlotte
uram
yes.
and--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--your
honor,
that
is
an
option
that
we
think
the
court
should
consider
if
the
court
does
not
agree
with
us
that--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--yes,
your
honor.
we
said
that
retroactive
relief
was
not
permissible
under
this
particular
compact
at
this
stage.
ms.
charlotte
uram
we
stipulated
to
his
authority
to
do
so,
but
he
did
not
believe
he
had
the
authority,
but,
your
honor,
we...
the
compact,
as
we
say,
at
this
stage--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--we
did
not
specifically
ask.
we
asked
for
a
hearing
on--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--we
are
asking
for
the
alternative,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
we
are
asking
for
the--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--for
the
alternative.
ms.
charlotte
uram
money.
we
are
asking
for,
if
the
court
decides
that
some
relief
must
be
given,
and
we
do
not
think
such
relief
is
appropriate
in
this
case
for
several
reasons,
but
if...
and
i
will
explain
those
reasons,
but
if
the
court
thinks
some
relief
is
appropriate,
then
we
think
that
the
court
should
consider
the
alternative
of
monetary
damages.
and
the
reason
is
that
if
the
court
is
going
beyond
the
compact
to
order
equitable
relief
in
this
case,
then
let
us
look
at
the
equities
of
this
situation.
the
master's,
the
relief
that
the
master
has
recommended
would
cause
so
much
greater
hardship
to
new
mexico
than--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--we
would
have
to
curtail
the
junior
users,
all
the
junior
users,
some
of
which
go
back
to
1890,
in
the
roswell
basin.
we
would
have
to
cut
off,
justice
white,
a
minimum
of
112,000
acres
of
land
in
new
mexico
to
benefit
a
maximum--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--we
wouldn't
have...
there
are
alternatives,
but
those
alternatives,
justice
white,
are
speculative.
they
require
further--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
exact
their
own
dislocations.
even
if
one
could
do
any
of
the
alternatives,
and
there
is
substantial
question
whether
we
could,
they
exact
their
own
dislocations.
we
would
be
closing
down
the
earliest
surface
water
users
in
that
basin.
ms.
charlotte
uram
i
assume
so,
your
honor,
but
the
record
does
not
provide
any
testimony
of
exactly
how
texas
will
use
the
water.
the
only
testimony
that
was
provided
was
one
anecdotal
witness,
and
from
her
testimony
we
can
calculate
that
if
it
were
applied
to
the
land,
the
most
acreage
that
it
could
benefit
is
in
the
4,000
to
10,000
acre
range.
so
you
would
be
shutting
down
a
minimum
of
112,000
acres
in
new
mexico
to
benefit
a
maximum--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--i
assume
they
need
water,
your
honor,
but
we
have
heard
no
testimony
about
how
texas
is
going
to
use
the
water,
nor,
would
i
point
out,
have
we
heard
testimony
about
what
texas's
harm
has
been
in
the
past.
ms.
charlotte
uram
i
believe
texas
wants
water
rather
than
money.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
charlotte
uram
it
is
not
a--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--we
can
settle
if
the
other
party
is
settling
for
money.
ms.
charlotte
uram
and,
your
honor,
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record,
although
not
a
matter
of
this
record,
that
texas
is
not
settling
for
money.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
have
continued
to
try
to
settle
this
controversy,
but
the
controversy
sticks
now
because
the
relief,
the
relief
that
the
master
has
recommended
is
so
onerous,
it
is
such
an
extended
hardship
to
new
mexico--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--both
states.
both
states
have
tried
to
settle,
but
the
relief
is
so
onerous,
and
that
is
where
we
stand.
ms.
charlotte
uram
justice
scalia,
there
was
an
exchange
that
addressed
the
issue
of
monetary
payment
in
lieu
of
water,
and
there
was
a
letter
written
from
counsel
of
the
state
of
texas
in
response
to
new
mexico's
offer
to
pay
water,
and
the
response
is
dated
october
28,
1986.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
this
record
but
it
is
public
knowledge
and
public
record,
and
it
says,
"texas
has
considered
whether
any
amount
of
money
might
compensate
texas
for
the
water
owed
us.
"
and
then
it
continues,
"we
have
determined
that
the
answer
must
be
no.
"
"only
payment
of
the
debt
in
water
will
suffice
to
compensate
texas.
"
"the
minimum
acceptable
payment
must
be
340,100
acre
feet
coupled
with
specific
guarantees
of
future
compact
compliance.
"
we
are
not
settling
on
the
basis
of
money
to
compensate
new
mexico
for
that
reason.
but
the
basic
question
is,
if
there
were
to
be
any
equitable
relief
for
texas,
how
would
anyone
know
what
it
is
to
be?
we
do
not
even
know
what
the
hardship
might
have
been
to
texas
in
all
these
years
for
lack
of
water.
ms.
charlotte
uram
you
do
look
at
both
of
those
factors.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
see,
here
the
relief
that
would
be
granted
if
it
looks
back
is
equitable
relief
and
not
contract
relief.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
if
i
understand
correctly,
you
know,
the
analysis
on
the
payment
for
anything
past
due
if
there
is
to
be
such
payment
is
not
within
the
framework
of
a
contract,
because
this
contract,
the
contracting
parties
here
specifically
rejected
retroactive
or
any
kind
of
payback
system.
they
rejected
that
for
reasons
having
to
do
with
the
way
they
wanted
this
compact
to
work,
and
those
reasons
are
still
valid.
so
it
is
only
if
the
court
goes
beyond
and
equity
intervenes
that
the
court...
it
is
within
that
equity
authority
that
the
court
would
be
looking
to
consider
any
other
sort
of
relief.
ms.
charlotte
uram
yes.
ms.
charlotte
uram
he
said
he
believed
it
was
without
foundation.
but,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
the
compact
is
quite
solid
on
this
point.
there
is
a
reason
why
the
compact
evolved
that
way,
and
the
reason
was
to
protect
these
other
concerns
that
the
compacting
parties
had.
ms.
charlotte
uram
yes.
yes,
we
did.
but
the--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--yes,
we
argued
that
nobody
knew
what
the
obligation
was,
that
texas
should
have
to
present--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--that's
correct.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct.
let
me
turn
quickly
to
the
question
of
man's
activities,
but
let
me
make
one
more
point
on
hardship,
and
that
is,
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
hardship
in
this
record
to
texas.
the
sole
testimony
is
from
one
anecdotal
witness,
and
her
testimony
suggests
that
in
fact
her
hardships
were
unrelated
to
any
activity
by
new
mexico.
on
the
question
of
the
basic
man's
activities
determination,
the
reason
that
new
mexico
is
before
the
court
on
this
question
is
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
man's
activities
issue
is
being
decided,
and
it
is
of
critical
importance
to
us
that
this
precedential
issue
be
done
in
the
way
new
mexico
bargained
for
when
new
mexico
entered
into
this
compact.
when
new
mexico
agreed
to
this
compact
at
the
outset
of
the
negotiations
in
1943
new
mexico
made
it
plain
that
because
this
river
was
so
variable,
and
because
the
calculations
required
were
so
extremely
difficult
to
do
correctly,
new
mexico
wanted
to
ensure
that
it
would
never
be
charged
for
any
losses
which
were
not
found
due,
which
were
not
shown
due
to
man's
activities
in
new
mexico.
the
problem
here
is
that
what
the
court,
what
the
master
heard
evidence
on
was
not
man's
activities
in
new
mexico.
he
never
heard
evidence,
what
are
man's
activities
in
new
mexico
and
how
do
they
affect
the
river?
now,
what
would
this
hearing
have
looked
like
if
he
had
heard
such
evidence?
well,
it
would
have--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--that's
correct.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct,
because
the
departure--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--there
are
unknowns,
but
that
doesn't
answer
your
question,
justice
white,
because--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--there
is
a
third
category
but
that
still
doesn't
answer
the
question
you
raise,
which
is,
if
we
have
accounted
for
natural
losses,
why
do
we
have
to
consider
man's
activities,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
accounting
for
the
natural
losses
is
done
on
the
basis,
as
this
court
noted
in
1983,
of
speculation
about
what
some
of
those
entries
are
to
balance
the
books,
and
as
this
court
also
noted
in
1983,
the
inflow-outflow
analysis
which
enables
anyone
to
look
and
to
make
those
determination
does
not
say
a
thing
about
causes.
it
doesn't
address
causes.
it
lumps
everything
together.
so
you
cannot
tell,
as
this
court
noted,
as
judge
brightenstein
noted
in
his
two
previous
reports,
you
cannot
tell
from
looking
at
any
information
through
the
inflow-outflow
method
what
happened
in
new
mexico
on
man's
activities.
ms.
charlotte
uram
the
thing
that
is
wrong
with
it
is
that
what
the
master
heard
at
the
hearing
was
the
second
stage
analysis,
departures
and
adjustments
to
departures.
in
other
words,
he
considered
what
was
not
man's
activities,
so
he
said
here
are
the
departures.
ms.
charlotte
uram
no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
both
parties
put
on
evidence
as
to
what
was
not
man's
activities.
new
mexico
was
of
the
understanding
that
there
was
to
be
further
consideration
of
new
mexico's
position,
which
is
that
you
need
to
have
your
affirmative
evidence
on
the
extent
to
which
man's
activities
in
new
mexico
might
have
caused
these
departures.
ms.
charlotte
uram
because
the
standard
against
which
everything
is
measured,
you
do
the
1947
flow
and
all
those
computations
annually.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct,
you
do
that
annually,
and
if
you
see
a
trend
of
departures
between
the
two,
then
you
look
at
man's
activities,
and
that
is
the
obligation.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
not
correct,
your
honor--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--because
of
the
nature
of
this
particular
river.
this
particular
river
is
so
difficult,
and
if
the
rains
come
in
at
one
place
as
opposed
to
another
place
it
has
a
whole
different
effect
on
the
river.
because
of
the
difficulty
of
this
particular
river
the
parties
set
up
a
very
complicated
scheme.
and
they
agreed
at
the
time,
and
the
federal
representative
agreed
at
the
time
that
this
scheme
was
the
fairest
way
to
administer
such
a
difficult
river.
ms.
charlotte
uram
because
that
is
the
basic
standard
that
the
compact
says--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--new
mexico
recommended
in
the
negotiations
that
there
be
no
standard
but
texas
wanted
a
standard,
and
so
as
a
consequence
we
do
have
a
standard,
and
then
a
further
limitation
to
man's
activities
under
the
standard.
ms.
charlotte
uram
the
natural
flow
is
not
that
reliable.
even
the
master
has
recommended
that
there
be
a
20
percent
good
faith
margin
set
on
delivery
to
account
for
the
variability
of
this
river.
look
at
the
numbers
in
table
2
of
texas's
exhibit
79
that
is
attached
to
our
brief.
variations
like
that
do
not
occur
on
a
regular
river
with
regular
uses,
with
regularly
accounted
for
natural
losses.
the
losses
here,
the
natural
losses
are
estimated.
if
the
water,
if
the
rain
comes
in,
for
example,
justice
scalia,
at
the
top
of
the
river
it
will
still
be
counted
in
the
analysis
but
it
will
never
make
it
to
the
same...
to
the
state
line.
if
it
comes
in
toward
the
bottom
of
the
river
it
will
make
it
to
the
state
line
and
it
will
be
counted
the
same,
so
you
will
have
two
different
consequences,
and
the
same
numbers
go
in,
and
the
only
difference
being
where
does
the
rain
fall.
natural
losses
account
for
a
great
deal
of
the
variation
in
this
river.
thank
you.
