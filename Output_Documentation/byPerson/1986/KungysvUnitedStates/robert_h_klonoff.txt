mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
denaturalization
laws
are
quite
clear.
there
are
two
separate
grounds
for
denaturalizing
someone.
number
one,
a
material
misrepresentation
ground,
and
number
two,
illegal
procurement.
and
mr.
williamson
has
never
responded
to
our
textual
argument
that
illegal
procurement
is
a
separate
and
distinct
form
of
denaturalization.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
i
have
two
answers
for
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
as
we
have
explained,
the
requirements
for
false
testimony
under
illegal
procurement
are
quite
different
than
the
requirements
for
material
misrepresentation.
and
there
are
category
of
cases
in
which
the
government
could
prove
illegal
procurement,
but
not
material
misrepresentation
and
vice-versa,
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
the
second
point,
however,
is
that
that
is
simply
not
the
way
the
legislative
history
suggests
congress
was
focusing
on
this.
the
illegal
procurement
legislative
history
in
1961
reveals
that
congress'
purpose
was
to
bring
in
all
of
the
1101(f).
now
mr.
williamson
says
that
this
court
should
pick
and
choose.
but
congress
said
that
1101(f)
defines
who
does
not
have
good
moral
character,
and
congress
made
clear
in
1961
that
individuals
who
lacked
good
moral
character
could
be
denaturalized
under
an
illegal
procurement
theory.
now
if
it
were
correct
that
congress
did
not
want
to
bring--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
textually
that's
a
different...
the
statute
1101(f)(6)
does
not
refer
to
false
testimony
about
the
other
subsections
of
(f).
it
talks
about
any
false
testimony
given
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
immigration
benefits.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
correct.
and
in
fact
that--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
not
any
mistake.
it
has
to...
if
somebody
was
naturalized
when
they
did
not
meet
the
requirements
for
naturalization
can
be
denaturalized.
this
court
has
been
clear
on
that
in
cases
going
back
to
ginsberg
in
which--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
think
that's
exactly
what
congress
intended.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
examine
the
1961
legislative
history.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
what
we
believe
congress
intended.
congress
in
fact
pointed
out
that,
for
example,
mr.--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--certainly
one
ground
would
be
in
a
form
of
prosecutorial
discretion
not
to
bring
a
denaturalization--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
i
was
going
to
follow
up
with
that.
that
is...
the
statute
does
seem
to
suggest
that
the
u.s.
attorney
shall
bring--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
think
that
when
congress
in
'61
restored
illegal
procurement,
they
were
talking
about
individuals
who
got
in
who
had
committed
murders,
for
example,
but
were
never
asked,
did
you
commit
a
murder.
and
congress
was
frustrated
at
the
fact
that
in
those
cases
where
somebody
never
qualified
for
naturalization
the
government
was
powerless
to
act.
it
must
be
remembered
we're
only
talking
about
a
category
of
people
who
were
not
entitled
to
citizenship
in
the
first
place.
we're
not
talking
about
bringing--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that's
not
the
view
that
this
court
has
taken.
i
was
going
back,
for
example,
to
the
ginsberg
case
where
the
court
said
that
where
somebody
didn't
meet
the
qualification
of
citizen
because
a
proceeding
was
held
in
chambers
rather
than
open
court,
the
court
said
this
person
lacked
a
statutory
requirement
for
citizenship,
and
therefore
it
was
illegally
procured.
all
i
can
suggest
is
that
the
court
examine
the
legislative
history
in
'61,
because
we
would
submit
it's
fully
consistent
with
the
position
we
are
taking.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
did
not,
mr.
justice
stevens.
in
counsel's
reading
of
our
brief,
he
failed
to
note
an
important
fact.
namely,
the
government
did
not
argue
1101(f)(6)
to
this
court
in
fedorenko.
we
were
not
addressing
that
issue
at
all.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
conceded--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
conceded
with
respect
to
section
10
of
the
displaced
persons
act
that
there
was
a
materiality
requirement
as
to
that
statute.
and
as
we
explained
in
our
supplemental
brief,
we
think
the
purposes
of
the
displaced
persons
act
were
quite
different
than
the
purposes
of
good
moral
character
statute,
1101(f)(6),
and
that
it
was
appropriate,
we
felt,
for
a
court
to
read
materiality
into
section
10.
we
in
no
way
addressed
whether
there
was
a
materiality
requirement
under
1101(f)(6).
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
absolutely.
we
have
no--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--question,
number
one,
as
to
the
material
misrepresentation
aspect.
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
concealment
of
a
material
fact
or
willful
misrepresentation.
we
don't
retrace
our
concession
that
the
misrepresentation
must
be
material
also.
that's
under
the
material
misrep
part
of
1451(a).
we
similarly
have
conceded,
and
still
do
that
there
is
a
materiality
requirement
under
section
10
of
the
dp
act.
but
this
is
quite
a
bit
different
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
neither
one
of
those
statutes
in
any
way
addressed
someone's
good
moral
character.
and
as
we
have
explained,
someone
who
deliberately
lies
under
oath
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
immigration
benefits,
we
submit,
does
not
possess
good
moral
character.
so
the
purposes
are
quite
different,
we
would
submit.
and,
therefore--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that's
our
position,
and
on
the
other
hand
the
government
has
to
show
that
the
person's
intent
was
to
obtain
immigration
benefits.
and
as
we
have
explained,
that's
a
difficult
burden.
and
ordinarily
if
a
lie
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
the
issues
of
immigration,
it's
going
to
be
exceedingly
difficult
for
the
government
to
show
that
the
person's
intent
in
lying
was
to
obtain
immigration
benefits.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
i
don't
think
you
have
to...
you
have
to
assume
that
someone
is
misinformed.
let
me
just
give
an
example
that
may
illustrate
the
point.
an
individual
is
applying
for
a
government
benefit,
let's
say
naturalization
or
a
visa,
and
his
wife
is
present.
and
he
is
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
age
is
relevant
to
the
decision
that
the
government
is
making.
and
so
in
order
to
obtain
the
government
benefit
he
deliberately
lies
about
his
age.
now
we
think
that's
the
type
of
case
that
fits
into
the
good
moral
character
provision.
the
person
with
the
intent
to--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
if
he
is
mistaken
that
age
has
nothing
to
do...
i'm
assuming
no
materiality
just
for
purposes
of
the
hypothetical.
that
person
clearly
lacks
good
moral
character,
we
would
submit,
regardless
of
whether
age
is
material.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
i'm
not
sure.
it
really
would--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
think
that
congress
made
that
conclusive
presumption.
this
isn't
something
that
we're
inventing.
we
are
construing
the
statutory
language.
let
me
just
round
the
situation
out.
let's
say
that
age
is
fundamentally
important
to
the
decision
that's
being
made,
but
the
person
doesn't
know
this.
he
lies
about
his
age
not
because
he's
trying
to
obtain
immigration
benefit,
but
because
his
wife
is
sitting
there
next
to
him
and
throughout
their
marriage
he
has
lied
about
his
age
and
he
doesn't
want
to
tell
the
truth.
now,
that
type
of
lie
is
willful.
he
clearly
was
lying
deliberately,
but
he
wasn't
lying
to
obtain
immigration
benefits.
that
is
where
the
material
misrep
provision
fits
in.
he
has
made
a
material
misrepresentation
and
it's
willful,
but
he
doesn't
fit
within
the
good
moral
character
provisions.
so
we
would
submit
that
the
two
statutes
really
do
reach
out
to
different
types
of
people,
and
that
that
is
precisely
what
congress
intended.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
he
did,
justice
o'connor.
and
counsel--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--he
did.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
120(a)
of
petitioner's
appendix.
the
district
court,
in
describing
the
visa
documents,
stated
that
the
documents
were
false
in
that
they
stated
the
defendant
had
not
previously
given
false
testimony
to
obtain
benefits
under
the
immigration
and
naturalization
laws.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
120(a)
of
the
petitioner's
appendix.
the
paragraph
beginning,
3,
1953>
["].
it's
the
second
half
of
the
second
sentence.
the
court
necessarily
had
to
have
found
in
making
the
observation
that
petitioner
lied
on
his
visa
papers
that
the
reason
for
his
lying
was
to
obtain
immigration
benefits.
otherwise,
he
would
have
been
telling
the
truth.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
right.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
correct.
if
the
district
court
believed
that
the
purpose
of
the
lie
was
not
to
obtain
immigration
benefit,
he
could
not
have
made
that
finding.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
it
isn't--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
we
think
that
if...
i
mean,
there
is
no
other
explanation
for
that
statement
other
than
that
the
court
concluded
that
the
purpose
of
the
lies
was
for
immigration
benefits.
it's
consistent,
by
the
way,
with
the
rest
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
because
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
government
didn't
qualify
in
1101(f)(6)
grounds
for
one
reason;
namely,
his
conclusion
that
1101(f)(6)
required
materiality.
had
the
district
court
felt
that
the
statements
were
not
given
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
immigration
benefits,
one
would
have
assumed,
given
this
thorough
opinion,
that
the
district
court
would
have
rejected
the
government's
argument
not
only
because
of
the
materiality
point,
but
also
because
of
the
purpose
of
the
lies.
we
think
that
when
that
statement
is
read
in
conjunction
with
the
court's
finding
that
the
government
didn't
qualify
under
1101(f)(6)
only
because
of
the
materiality
which
the
court
read
into
the
statute,
we
think
it
is
reasonably
clear.
i
would
agree
that
the
court
did
not
state
affirmatively,
i
hereby
find,
but
we
think
that
that's--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
judge
scalia,
certainly
the
court
would
not
require
before
the
government
could
rely
on
a
district
court
finding
of
fact
that
the
district
court
couple
it
with
an
exhaustive
legal
analysis.
i
mean,
of
course
we
don't
know
exactly--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
certainly
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
opinion
to
suggest
to
the
contrary,
we
would
submit.
i
mean,
the
district
court
certainly
didn't
say
that
that
was
not
its
purpose.
the
district
court
wondered
why
somebody
would
lie
about
these
things,
but
we
think
that
this
is
the
closest
thing
there
is
to
a
finding,
but
let
me
follow
up
on
that
because
this
relates
to
points
we
made
both
in
our
opening
and
our
supplemental
briefs.
however
that
intent
requirement
is
proven,
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
government
to
prove
it
in
a
situation
where
you
have
one
lie
that's
inconsequential,
that
doesn't
relate
to
issues
of
immigration
or
naturalization.
however,
when
you
have
a
pattern
of
lies,
it
becomes
inescapable
that
the
person's
intent
was
to
obtain
immigration
benefits.
here,
for
example,
what's
quite
powerful,
we
would
submit,
is
that
the
individual
not
only
lied
at
the
visa
stage
but
at
the
naturalization
stage.
he
has
given
a
number
of
explanations.
he
was
trying
to
evade
the
germans,
trying
to
avoid
conscription.
those
explanations
are
meaningless
at
the
naturalization
stage.
there
was
absolutely
no
reason
for
someone
to
perpetuate
those
lies
many
years
later
when
the
person
was
safely
in
the
united
states.
so
we
would
submit
that
that
pattern
of
false
testimony
at
every
purpose
extending,
by
the
way,
to
testimony
in
1975
before
an
immigration--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
we
doubt
that
he
would
have
acknowledged--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--he
may
not
have.
he
probably
would
not
have.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
he
probably
would
not
have.
there
are
many,
many--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
that's
certainly
not
a
reason
for
this
court
to
sanction
it.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
because
it
goes
to
his
intent.
if
his
real
intent
was
not
to
obtain
immigration
benefits,
then
he
would
have
straightened
it
out.
the
question
that
i
was
asked
had
to
do
with
his
intent,
and
we
would
submit
that
if
his
intent
was
to
obtain
immigration
benefits,
he
would
perpetuate
the
lie.
if
his
lie
was
given
for
another
reason,
then
he
could
straighten
it
out
and
he
would
be
entitled--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--i
would
respectfully--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--with
all
respect,
justice
stevens,
i
would
submit
if
somebody
had
an
intent
other
than
to
obtain
immigration
benefits,
and
he
explained
that
to
the
naturalization
examiner,
here
is
why
i
lied,
it
was
not
to
obtain
immigration
benefits.
it
was
because
i
afraid
of
being
conscripted.
he
would
still
be
eligible
for
citizenship.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
correct,
that
as
he
would
be
if
he
was
able
to
get
into
the
country
having
successfully
concealed
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
murder,
or
one
of
the
other
good
moral
character
requirements.
we
don't
think
there
is
anything
anomalous
about
that.
in
fact,
we
would
submit
that
if
there
is
any
anomaly
there,
it's
for
congress
to
correct.
these
kinds
of
extreme--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--let
me
respond
to
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
in
the
facts
of
this
case
that
explanation
doesn't
withstand
scrutiny.
he
had
in
his
possession
documents
that
bore
his
true
date
and
place
of
birth.
so
he
did
not...
that
explanation
is
simply
without
merit.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
the
district
court--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--he
never
argued--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that
argument
was
made
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
at
oral
argument.
there
is
no
finding.
his
argument
throughout
this
case
is
that
the
reason
he
lied
was
to
avoid
conscription
in
the
german
army.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
as
i
said,
we
don't
know
exactly
what
the
district
court
was
talking
about.
it
isn't
as
clear
as
it
could
have
been
in
the
sense
of
elaboration.
we
submit
that
it's
sufficient
for
a
finding,
but
let
me
respond
further
to
your
question.
somebody
who
lies
in
order
to
get
ahead
of
the
pack
or
to
push
the
process
along
absolutely
fits
within
what
the
government
is
arguing
here,
because
the
court
has
to
remember,
this
is
a
quota
system,
and
the
quota
is
going
to
run
out.
and
if
somebody
lies
to
get
ahead
of
the
pack,
he's
going
to
get
a
visa
that
otherwise
would
have
gone
to
someone
else
who
went
through
the
honest
process
of
getting
correct
identification
documents.
so
we
would
submit
that
someone
like
that
also
lacks
good
moral
character
if
his
purpose
is
to
jump
ahead
of
the
pack
and
get
immigration
benefits.
if
i
could--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that's
a
factual
question
in
each
case,
we
would
submit.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
it
has
to
be
a
question
of
fact.
if
the
person
had
adopted
a
false
i.d.
many,
many
years
earlier
for
a
totally
different
purpose--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--if
he
adopted
a
false
identity
to
facilitate
getting
in
and
jumped
ahead
of
the
pack--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
would.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that
would
be
our
position.
that's
consistent
with
the
statutory--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
let
me
say
that
whether
or
not
there
are
people
excludable
under
what
congress
defined,
that
shouldn't
necessarily
bear
on
the
statutory
construction
issue.
it's
for
congress
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
is
a
correct
policy
of
excluding
people
who
made
those
kinds
of
laws.
i
would
refer
this
court
to
two
recent
cases
in
the
deportation
context:
hector
and
phinpathya.
phinpathya,
it
was
available
to
the
alien
to
make
all
kinds
of
absurd
arguments
that
a
brief
absence
from
the
united
states
would
totally
disqualify
somebody
for
claiming
suspension
of
deportation.
and
this
court
held
correctly
that
the
plain
language
of
the
suspension
statute
required
that
any
absence
broke
that
continuity
of
physical
presence,
and
that
it
was
for
congress
to
change
the
law.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
we
don't
think
that...
our
argument
does
not
depend
on
legislative
history.
we
think
that
congress
restoring
the
words
"illegal
procurement"
is
quite
clear
that
somebody
who
lacked
a
qualification
for
citizenship
could
be
denaturalized.
that's
the
text
of
the
statute.
you
go
on
and
look
at
the
'61
legislative
history,
and
that
fully
corroborates
the
government.
we
would
submit
that
in
an
analysis
of
statutory
construction
the
burden
should
have
been
on
the
petitioner
to
come
in
and
show
through
legislative
history
that
congress
meant
something
else.
the
legislative
history
bolsters
our
argument,
but
it
is
no
way
essential
to
it.
we
think
that
the
text
is
dispositive.
let
me
move
briefly
if
i
could
to
the
issue
of
materiality
unless
there
are
any
more
questions
on
the
1105(f)(6)
point.
we
would
agree
with
the
observation
made
by
justice
o'connor,
and
in
fact
that's
central
to
our
argument
of
materiality.
that
in
no
other
area
of
the
law,
and
petitioner
has
cited
none,
has
materiality
been
construed
to
require
a
dispositive
fact.
now
the
government
has
argued
for
a
criminal
standard
of
materiality.
it
has
also
construed
chaunt
as
a
would/might
test
as
i
have
explained
previously
the
last
time
the
case
was
argued,
and
as
we
have
explained
at
length
in
our
brief.
but
whether
or
not
the
court
goes
with
the
would/might
test,
or
the
criminal
test,
or
some
other
test,
for
example,
the
tsc
test,
the
important
point
that
the
government
is
making
here
is
that
this
court
should
not
require
proof
of
a
dispositive
fact.
in
that
regard,
let
me
just
note
counsel's
heavy
reliance
on
one
case,
the
day
case
from
1929,
the
second
circuit
case.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues
here
for
several
reasons.
it
wasn't
a
construction
of
1451,
and
furthermore,
i
would
urge
the
court
to
look
at
landon
v.
clark
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
first
circuit
case
from
1956,
which
traces
the
law
subsequent
to
day,
and
indicates
that
even
in
the
second
circuit
the
court
had
backed
away
from
any
requirement
of
a
dispositive
fact.
and
we
would
submit
the
law
is
quite
clear
as
we
have
laid
out
in
our
brief,
both
before
and
after
chaunt,
that
the
courts
have
not
required
a
dispositive
fact
in
order
to
establish
materiality.
we
would
submit
that
there
are
several
reasons
why
this
court
should
reject
the
argument
of
the
dispositive
fact.
first
of
all,
our
interpretation
is
more
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
statute.
if
you
were
to
require
a
dispositive
fact
under
the
material
misrepresentation
clause,
that
would
essentially
render
that
ground
for
denaturalization
meaningless,
because
the
government
would
have
demonstrated
illegal
procurement
in
every
case,
and
it
would
be
entirely
irrelevant
whether
the
person
lied
or
told
the
truth.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
we
would
submit
that
in
ginsberg,
even
in
fedorenko
itself,
the
court
has
read
illegal
procurement
to
mean
somebody
who
obtained
citizenship
without
possessing
the
statutory
qualifications.
if
the
court
is
going
to
retreat
from
those
cases,
then
it's
an
open
issue.
but
we
would
submit
that
fedorenko
traces
the
law
from
ginsberg
to
that
decision.
we
would
submit
that
that
is
the
law;
that
illegal
procurement
dealt
with
someone
who
didn't
possess
the
requirements.
but
that
is
true,
our
argument
depends
on
that
link.
secondly,
and
i'll
only
briefly
touch
upon
this,
a
standard
that
requires
a
dispositive
fact
gives
the
alien
every
incentive
to
lie,
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
fedorenko.
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
at
the
denaturalization
stage,
and
it
will
be
more
difficult
for
the
government
later
on
to
uncover
disqualifying
facts.
related
to
that
point--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
except
that
a
person
who
is
trying
to
get
over
here,
a
person
in
another
country
who
is
faced
with
the
situation
where
if
he's
denied
a
visa
it's
essentially
unreviewable,
he's
not
thinking
about
whether
he
is
going
to
be
prosecuted
for
perjury
or
not.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
the
naturalization
stage,
there
is
some--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--there
is
some
deterrent
with
the
perjury
law,
we
would
acknowledge,
but
we
don't
think
it's
a
sufficient
deterrent
where
somebody
is
seeking
something
like
naturalization
and
where
the
fact
it's
being
hidden
is
really
buried
in
his
past,
and
one
could
safely
hope
that
he
could
get
past
the
short
statute
of
limitations
for
a
perjury
conviction.
related
to
those
points,
we
would
submit
that
if
individuals
are
given
a
license
to
lie,
it
makes
it
very,
very
difficult
for
the
immigration
officials
to
do
their
job
properly.
as
the
material
is
revealed,
there
are
very
few
vice
counsels
to
process
these
applications.
they
don't
have
big
staffs
to
go
out
and
investigate
every
case,
and
they
rely
very
heavily
on
the
truthfulness
of
the
applicants.
and
if
they
are
going
to--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
don't
know
that.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
don't
know
that.
let
me
say
further
though,
we
have
argued
throughout,
and
we
are
quite
clear
in
our
supplemental
brief
that
testimony
has
its
limited
definition.
petitioner
has
never
quarreled
with
the
government
that
he
had
given
testimony.
that's
quite
clear
from
the
joint
appendix,
page
157,
for
example,
dealing
with
the
naturalization
stage.
the
testimony
of
the
naturalization
examiner
is
that
the
preliminary
examiner
would
check
off
each
question
that
was
asked
of
the
applicant
under
oath.
so
we
would
submit
that
on
that
issue
of
whether
there
is
testimony,
there
really
hasn't
been
any
dispute.
plus,
the
record
is
overwhelming.
we
don't
know,
and
again
i
would
submit
that
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
a
court
has
required
before
it
will
accept
the
finding
of
fact
that
a
district
judge
lay
out
in
detail
its
understanding
of
testimony.
we
think
testimony
is
a
well
established
term
in
the
case
law.
we
think
the
district
court's
finding
was
supported
by
the
evidence,
and
consequently,
the
court
should
not
require
that
the
district
judge
have
given
an
analysis
of
what
it
means
by
testimony.
we
don't
think
a
remand
on
that
issue
would
be
necessary,
particularly
since
there
really
has
been
no
dispute
on
that
point.
finally,
let
me
make
this
point
in
terms
of
the
standard
of
proof
of
materiality.
much
of
petitioner's
argument
has
rested
on
the
theory
that
somehow
if
the
court
adopts
that
standard
it's
going
to
lead
to
unfairness
in
the
immigration
process
that
justice
scalia's
question
seemed
to
references
that
people
are
going
to
be
denaturalized
for
inconsequential
lies,
and
that
somehow
there
is
going
to
be
an
unfairness
in
the
system.
let
me
point
out,
however,
that
since
1952
when
the
misrepresentation
clause
was
enacted,
1451(a),
the
courts
have
almost
unanimously
interpreted
materiality
the
way
the
government
has
urged,
and
after
chaunt,
with
the
exception
of
the
tenth
circuit,
they
have
continued
to
do
so.
so
the
test
of
materiality
that
the
government
has
urged
has
been
the
law
for
over
three
decades,
and
we
would
submit--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
certainly...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
if
the
court
is
not
worried
about
the
government's
test
of
materiality,
that's
all
the
better
from
our
position.
counsel
was
worried
in
his
briefs,
and
i
was
responding
to
the
concerns
he
had
raised.
