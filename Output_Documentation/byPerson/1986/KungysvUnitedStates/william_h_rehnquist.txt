chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
oral
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-228,
kungys
against
the
united
states.
mr.
williamson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
williamson,
you
say
in
effect
then
that
the
part
of
1451
that
talks
about
misrepresentation
covers
the
waterfront
so
far
as
denaturalization
is
concerned,
and
that
you
can't
bring
other
forms
of
misrepresentation
in
under
the
head
of
illegally
procured?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
williamson.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
klonoff.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
klonoff,
ordinarily
when
you
are
construing
a
statute
such
as
1451,
the
section
we're
talking
about,
where
it
covers
quite
elaborately
the
ground
of
misrepresentation
as
the
basis
for
denaturalization,
and
then
something
else
is
there,
illegal
procurement,
you
would
not
think
that
illegal
procurement
embraced
also
misrepresentation
which
is
elaborately
covered
in
virtually
the
next
sentence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
if
you
deliberately
lie
under
oath
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
naturalization,
you
do
not
possess
good
moral
character
even
though
the
misrepresentation
may
not
be
material.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are
reading
from
120(a)
of?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
now
you
are
relying
on
the
sentence
that
says,
"the
documents
were
false
as
to
defendant's
date
and
place
of
birth.
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
"and
in
that
stated
that
defendant
had
not
previously
given
false
testimony
to
obtain
benefits
under
the
immigration
and
naturalization
laws.
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
a
rather
opaque
finding,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
certainly
not
explicit.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
here
you
are
not
dealing
with
anything
quite
as
clear
as
the
plain
language.
what
you
are
talking
about
is
the
phrase
1451
in
1961.
and
you
have
to
go
back
to
make
legislative
history
arguments
to
say
that
you
don't
construe
1451,
as
amended,
the
way
you
normally
would.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klonoff.
mr.
williamson,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
williamson.
the
case
is
submitted.
