justice
white
well,
mr.
williamson,
don't
we
have
to
go
through...
isn't
it
necessary
to
go
through
the
same
sort
of
an
inquiry
at
the
naturalization
stage?
something
might
be
immaterial
at
the
visa
stage
and
quite
material
at
the
naturalization
stage.
justice
white
well,
at
the
naturalization
stage
if
he
had
said,
yes,
i
lied
on
my
visa
application.
justice
white
then
there
would
have
been
an
inquiry
what
did
you
lie
about.
justice
white
and
you
would
have
gotten
into
where
he
lived
and
what
he
did
at
the
critical
time,
wouldn't
you?
justice
white
well,
living
in
this
particular...
living
in
this
particular
city
might
have...
at
that
time
might
have
meant
something
different
to
the
person
presiding
over
the
naturalization
than--
justice
white
--over
the
visa.
justice
white
i
know
that's
at
the
visa
stage.
justice
white
that's
at
the
visa
stage,
and
the
reason
is
that
probably
nobody
knew
there
were
any
events
that
had
happened
at
that
time.
justice
white
well,
everybody
knew
that.
everybody
knew
what
had
gone
on
at
that
time.
justice
white
well,
at
least
there
was
no...
nobody
expressly
expressed
that
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
did
they?
justice
white
well,
that's
your
version
of
the
record.
justice
white
well,
it
isn't
a
version
of
any
court
that
i
know
of.
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
against
you.
justice
white
exactly,
but
on
the
materiality
ground
they
did.
justice
white
that's
all
right.
go
ahead,
go
ahead.
justice
white
but
it
didn't
address
at
the
naturalization
stage
either.
