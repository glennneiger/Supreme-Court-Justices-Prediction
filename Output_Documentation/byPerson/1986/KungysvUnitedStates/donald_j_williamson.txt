mr.
donald
j.
williamson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
the
reargument
of
a
denaturalization
case
involving
whether
a
final
judgment
of
a
federal
court
granting
naturalized
citizen
to
an
immigrant
can
be
vacated
on
the
grounds
he
misrepresented
in
his
immigration
papers
that
he
was
two
years
old,
and
that
he
was
born
in
a
city
instead
of
a
town.
at
the
time
the
petitioner
was
granted
his
citizenship
in
1954,
section
340
a
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952,
which
is
8
usc
1451(a),
provided,
in
pertinent
part,
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorneys
to
institute
proceedings
for
the
purposes
of
revoking
and
setting
aside
the
order
admitting
such
person
to
citizenship,
and
cancelling
a
certificate
of
naturalization
on
the
ground
that
such
order
and
certificate
of
naturalization
were
procured
by
concealment
of
a
material
fact
or
by
willful
misrepresentation.
the
district
court
expressly
found
that
the
petitioner,
had
he
given
the
correct
information
on
his
visa
application
form,
his
visa
nevertheless
would
have
been
issued,
and
that
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
his
having
been
born
on
september
21,
1915,
in
reistru,
would
have
had
any
effect
whatsoever.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that
finding,
and,
indeed,
it
did
not
declare
that
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
were
clearly
erroneous
as
was
required
by
rule
52(a).
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
by
construing
the
alternative
approach
to
materiality
in
chaunt,
as
permitting
proof
that
disclosure
of
petitioner's
true
date
and
town
of
birth
would
have
resulted
in
an
investigation
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
district
court
expressly
found
that
the
government's
own
proofs
indicated
that
no
investigation
would
have
resulted.
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
effect,
drew
an
inference
in
favor
of
the
government
that
the
disclosure
of
the
truth
of
his
correct
date
and
place
of
birth
would
have
led
to
residency
records
in
germany,
and
from
those
residency
records
you
could
draw
a
further
inference
that
he
was
not
a
victim
of
nazi
persecution.
a
former
vice
counsel,
but
one
who
had
not
processed
the
petitioner's
papers,
had
testified
that
that
was
an
ultimate
disqualifying
fact.
in
other
words,
if
you
are
not
a
victim
of
nazi
persecution,
you
are
not
eligible
for
a
nonpreference
"immigration
visa".
however,
as
indicated
by
the
statement
at
oral
argument
by
the
government,
there
was
no
such
statute.
there
was
no
such
regulation,
and
therefore
there
is
no
ultimate
fact.
so
the
posture
of
the
case
at
this
point
is
that
the
government
has
no
proof
of
any
ultimate
disqualifying
fact.
and
their
argument,
therefore,
is
that
chaunt
does
not
require
proof
of
an
ultimate
disqualifying
fact.
and
their
further
argument
is
that
any
misrepresentation,
irrespective
of
materiality,
is
sufficient
to
have
constituted
a
legal
procurement,
because
the
words
1451
by
an
amendment
in
1965,
which
was
seven
years
after
mr.
kungys
or
the
petitioner
was
granted
his
citizenship.
the
short
argument
to
the
fact
that
a
nonmaterial
misrepresentation
cannot
be
the
basis
for
denaturalization
is
that
the
statute,
section
1451,
explicitly
requires
that
the
misrepresentation
or
concealment
be
as
to
a
material
fact.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes,
what
i
argue,
and
in
fact
what
i
think
is
reasonable
clear
is
that
when
congress
sets
forth
that
the
basis
for
denaturalization
when
it
comes
explicitly
to
a
misrepresentation
must,
in
effect,
be
procured
by
a
concealment
of
a
material
fact,
that
is
clear
language;
clear
in
the
sense
that
it
certainly
the
requirement
of
materiality
is
clear.
to
argue,
in
effect,
because
there
are
nonmisrepresentational
forms
of
conduct
that
can
in
effect
constitute
illegal
procurement
irrespective
of
whether
there
is
a
misrepresentation,
i.e.,
such
as
if
a
person
has
contracted
a
dangerously
contagious
disease
and
is
unaware
of,
they
could
still
be
denaturalized;
i.e.,
if
a
person
engaged
in
rape
and
if
there
was
no
such
question
asking
whether
you,
in
effect,
had
engaged
in
rape;
or
whether
or
not
you
had
aided
the
illegal
entry
of
other
aliens,
those
are
the
examples
which
were
used
in
the
legislative
history
in
1961
to
indicate
the
reason
for
the
change.
but
that
doesn't
mean
in
point
of
fact
that
when
you
attempt
to
use
illegal
procurement
as
the
arguments
made
by
the
government
in
the
case
of
fedorenko,
and
there
is
an
interesting
statement
in
the
brief
on
page
18
of
solicitor
general,
whether
petitioner's
citizenship
is
considered
to
be
illegally
procured,
or
procured
by
misrepresentation,
the
primary
basis
for
its
revocation,
petitioner's
false
representations
concerning
his
whereabouts
during
world
war
ii.
accordingly,
we
agree
that
petitioner's
wartime
activities,
specifically
his
guard
duty
at
triblinka
must
be
shown
to
be
material
facts
within
the
meaning
of
8
usc
1451(a).
that
was
the
case...
the
government
argued
that
in
fedorenko
in
its
brief.
this
is
the
brief
of
the
united
states
in
that
case.
and,
indeed,
that
particular
portion
of
the
brief,
i
believe,
was
the
basis
when
justice
marshall
speaking
for
the
majority
in
fedorenko
indicated
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
there
had
misrepresented
his
country
of
birth
on
his
visa,
but
that
did
not
end
the
judicial
inquiry.
justice
marshall
speaking
for
the
majority
court
said,
"we
agree
with
the
government
that
that
does
not
end
the
judicial
inquiry,
because
the
test
is
still
materiality.
"
indeed,
the
question
there
was
still
materiality
as
to
whether
or
not
the
status
of
being
a
concentration
camp
guard,
in
effect,
was
a
predicate
for
denaturalization.
and,
indeed,
that
particular
case
was
an
illegal
procurement
case.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes.
i
think
it's
an
academic
discussion
on
behalf
of
the
client
i
represent,
because
i
don't
think
the
misrepresentations
that
he
made
in
his
petition
for
naturalization
or
his
visa
application
were
even
important.
however--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--yes.
however,
not
important
in
the
sense
that
it
obviously
could
not
have
affected
the
decisions
to
whether
the
visa,
and
it
certainly
doesn't
affect
the
ability
to
grant
the
citizenship.
but
i
would
also
state--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--well,
once
the
decision
is
made
to
grant
the
visa,
the
vice
counsel
loses
his
jurisdiction.
at
that
point
in
time
its
a
judicial
determination,
and
the
determination
of
what
is
important
or
not
important
goes
to
the
question
of
whether,
(a)
he
was
eligible
in
the
first
instance,
or
(b)
whether
he
was
in
the
categories
that
are
excludable.
and
this
traces
all
the
way
back,
and
it's
very
interesting
because
i
traced
the
history
as
to
whether
or
not
even
with
respect
to
a
visa,
it
had
to
be
a
material
fact
and
one
which
is
beyond
important,
i.e.,
that
is
really
is
decisive
because
that
is
the
alternative
dictionary
meaning.
having
great
consequences
is
one
of
the
definitions
which
i
saw
in
a
dictionary.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
well,
then
i
would
argue,
in
effect,
that
in
light
of
the
nature
of
the
misrepresentations
which
were
made
in
preceding
cases,
that
none
of
these
misrepresentations
rise
to
the
dignity
of
those
particular
cases.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
well--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--well,
let
me
say
this.
if
in
fact
it
was
not
a
false
perception,
in
other
words,
if
indeed
he
perceived
that
these
lies
were
significant,
then
merely
the
question
of
intent--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--well,
according
to
judge
learned
hand,
it
would
not.
the
cases
trace
back
all
the
way
to
the
case
of
united
states
v.
iorio
day.
there
is
a
case
in
which
the
petitioner
there,
or
the
person
who
sought
to
obtain
the
visa,
denied
that
he
had
ever
been
in
prison.
obviously,
he
perceived
that
denying
that
he
had
ever
been
in
prison
was
significant
and
that
his
perception
would
naturally
be
that
that
would
influence
the
vice
counsel.
what
judge
learned
hand
said
in
iorio
v.
day
was
it's
true
that
the
relator
is
bound
to
tell
the
truth.
but
if
what
he
suppressed
was
irrelevant
to
his
admission,
its
mere
suppression
would
not
debar
him.
so
the
first
question
comes
down
to
at
most
whether
the
facts,
had
he
disclosed
them,
would
have
been
enough
to
justify
the
refusal
of
a
visa
or
exclusion
upon
entry.
the
appellant
did
not
suppress
from
the
vice
counsel
facts
which
would
have
justified
in
refusing
a
visa
had
he
disclosed
it.
so
that
in
other
words--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--no,
this
was
speaking
in
terms
of
what
is
the
predicate
necessary
to
deport
an
alien.
in
that
particular
instance,
what
judge
learned
hand
was
addressing
himself
was
the
1924
act.
the
1924
act
is
the
same
act
under
which
this
petitioner
was
brought
in.
and
he
was
not
addressing
himself
to
1001.
what
he
was
addressing
himself
to
was,
in
effect,
whether
or
not
this
particular
immigrant
could
be,
or
alien
could
be
deported
because
his
visa
wasn't
valid.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
right.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
well,
1101(f)(6),
in
my
judgment,
does
not
come
into
play,
because,
in
effect,
1101(f)(6)
is
simply
the
means
of
determining
whether
or
not
a
person
is
qualified
for
naturalization.
and
this
court
as
far
back
as
scheiderman
has
always
distinguished
between
naturalization
and
denaturalization.
here,
in
effect,
we're
not
talking
about
the
burden
that
the
applicant
has
to
bear
in
order
to
be
naturalized.
we're
talking
about
the
burden
that
the
government
has
to
bear
in
order
to
vacate
a
judgment
of
a
court.
and
that's
why,
of
course,
the
evidence
has
to
be
clear,
convincing,
unequivocable.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
no,
i
think
that
the
distinction
covers
more
than
shifting
of
the
burden.
the
distinction
goes
to
the
very
nature
of
the
right
that
is
at
stake.
and
i
believe
that,
as
justice
blackman
indicated
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
fedorenko
case,
that
once
we
discuss
the
question
of
citizenship
already
granted,
in
order
to
vacate
it
the
only
section
of
the
statute
which
applies
is
1451(a).
but
in
any
event,
each
of
the
courts
that
have
addressed
this
issue--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--well,
textually
the
way
that
i
get
to
it
is
that
1451
states
the
requirements
for
denaturalization.
and
it
states
that
it
must
be
procured
by
the
misrepresentation
of
a
material
fact.
when
it
comes
to
illegal
procurement,
as
justice
brennan
indicated
in
the
costello
case,
the
reason
for
the
inclusion
of
the
language
of
misrepresentation
of
material
fact
was
to
distinguish
between
intrinsic
fraud
and
extrinsic
fraud,
but
clearly
it
was
not
the
situation
given
a
lucid
definition
of
misrepresentation.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
the
incorporation
of
1101,
or
1101(f)(6).
so
that
i
would
suggest
that
the
distinction
goes
beyond
the
mere
burden
of
proof.
but
in
any
event,
getting
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
if
i
may,
i
think
that
it's
more
than
simply
the
mere
dictionary
meaning.
when
we
look
at
black's
law
dictionary,
black's
law
dictionary
addresses
i
think
a
more
pertinent
aspect
of
it,
because
it
goes
to
the
question
of
material
fact
in
the
context
of
the
law,
in
the
context
of
a
contract,
and
the
contracts
of
insurance
policies,
in
the
context
of
a
pleading,
in
a
context,
for
example,
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
in
those
particular
instances
the
cause
and
effect
relationship
of
materiality,
it's
without
which
the
particular
contract
wouldn't
have
been
granted.
the
insurance
policy
wouldn't
have
issued.
so
in
this
particular
instance,
it
has
to
be
more
than
simply
important.
it
is
a
but
for
requirement,
and
i
believe
the
language
of
the
statute
indicates
that
pretty
clearly,
because
it
doesn't
simply
say
material
fact
in
the
abstract.
it
says
procured
by,
not
capable
of
being
procured
by,
not
could
have
been
procured
by,
but
procured
by...
very
strong
word.
and
again
as
indicated
by
justice
douglas,
it
was
referred
to
in
the
other
opinions,
fraud
and
misrepresentations
are
strong
words.
strong
words
require
a
vigorous
burden
of
proof.
they
require
a
vigorous
application
before
we
vacate
a
judgment
of
a
court.
and
what
the
government
is
seeking
is
a
soft
definition
of
a
harsh
term.
so
to
merely
say
it's
important,
i
would
suggest,
does
not
do
justice
to
the
rights
that
are
at
stake
here.
these
consequences
of
denaturalization
are
far
more
serious
than
fine
and
imprisonment.
and
i
don't
mean
to
trivialize
fine
and
imprisonment,
and
i
don't
mean
to
trivialize
the
fact
of
lying.
obviously,
lying
is
not
to
be
encouraged.
on
the
other
hand,
anytime
that
a
person
"lies"
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
under
any
of
the
statutes
the
mere
fact
of
lying
results
in
consequences.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
there
was
clearly
a
policy
that
because
of
the
pressures
in
europe,
because
of
so
many
displaced
persons
that
were
there,
that
there
was
all
efforts
were
to
be
made
to
bring
these
immigrants
in.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
but
there
wasn't
any
such
administrative
practice,
and
indeed--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--well,
if
there
had
been,
then
the
question
really
would
be,
in
effect,
is
would
that
have
been
totally--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--lying
as
to
anything?
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
if
he
lied
as
to
anything,
then
i
would
suggest
that
the
vice
counsel
is
not
the
final
determinant.
the
final
determinant
at
that
time
would
have
been
the
counsel,
attorney
counsel
for
the
state
department.
and
in
turn,
that
would
be
reviewed
by
a
court.
when
those
situations
at
that
time
were
reviewed
by
the
court
such
as
in
the
tepper
case,
judge
irving
kaufman
indicated
in
that
case
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
the
vice
counsel
would
have
decided
that
he
lied,
and
therefore
would
have
in
effect
denied
the
visa.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
he
had
done
so
on
a
ground
specifically
excludable
by
law.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
regulation
then
in
effect
specifically
stated
that
the
grounds
of
exclusion
are
those
grounds
which
are
specifically
listed
in
the
application
for
the
visa,
and
any
law
is
not
set
forth
there.
what
is
set
forth
in
the
visa
application
refers
to
misrepresentation
as
to
a
material
fact.
the
test
has
always
been
a
material
fact.
indeed,
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
whether
or
not
you
could
bring
in
other
statutes.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
courts
have
never
held
that
any
lie
even
in
those
statutes.
they
have,
in
effect,
engrafted
a
judge
made
interpretation
of
even
1001,
but
notwithstanding
the
language
"any
misstatement".
it
means,
in
effect,
any
material
misstatement,
so
it
excludes
innocuous
lies.
in
addition
to
which
the
courts
have
even
accepted
the
question
of
the
exculpatory
no,
because,
for
example,
on
this
visa
application
what
you
had
was
the
specific
question,
18(c)
i
believe
it
was,
have
you
ever
in
effect
made
any
misrepresentations
in
order
to
gain
benefits
under
the
act.
the
simple
answer
is
no.
the
courts
have
engrafted
into
similar
language
under
1001,
the
defense
that's
not
covered
by
it
because
otherwise
in
effect
you
would
be
violating
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
other
particular
policy
considerations.
so
we
have
always
looked
to
the
question
of
materiality.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes,
i
agree
that
you
must
go
through
the
inquiry
at
the
naturalization
stage.
but,
again,
for
example
by
virtue...
in
fedorenko.
in
fedorenko,
fedorenko
indicated
to
the
examiner
at
the
time
that
he
had
lied
with
respect
to
his
country
of
birth.
and
the
examiner
at
that
time
said
that's
of
no
concern
to
us.
so
in
point
of
fact,
it
really
comes
down
to
whether
at
that
stage,
and
again
it's
not
any
lie,
but
whether
or
not
they
could
have
legitimately
denied
naturalization.
and
the
question
would
be
the
significance
of
a
lie.
let
me
give
an
illustration.
suppose,
for
example,
we
had
a--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--yes.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
well,
what
you
have
gotten
into
is
the
truth.
and
the
question
is
what
is
the
consequence
of
the
truth,
and
that's
what
we
have
said
that
the
test
was
in
chaunt.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
not
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
not
in
this
case.
the
district
court
specifically
held,
relying
upon
the
evidence
of
the
government
of
vice
counsel,
the
residence
in
kedainiai
was
of
no
effect
whatsoever.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
even
at--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--there
was
no
knowledge
that
any
events
happened
in
1954
when
he
was
granted
his
citizenship
either.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
in
1954,
there
was
no
indication
with
respect
to
kedainiai
that
had
any
significance
whatsoever.
but
let
me
turn
around
the
other
way.
what
he
said
was--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--the
reason
for
it
is--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--they
did
not
address
whether
in
1954,
but
what
said
in
effect
no
investigation
would
have
resulted
as
a
result
of
the
disclosure
of
the
truth.
but
let
me
put
it
the
other
way.
if
in
point
of
fact
there
was
concern
about
lithuania
at
that
time,
he
indicated
he
was
born
in
kaunas.
a
greater
number
atrocities
occurred
in
kaunas
than
elsewhere.
and
let
me
also
say
that
his
application
was
processed
at
the
same
time
as
his
wife.
she
indicated
she
lived
in
kedainiai.
in
addition
to
which
we
have
other
people
who
testified,
such
as
juozas,
who
indicated
they
lived
in
kedainiai.
kedainiai
was
of
no
significant
to
the
grant
of
the
petitions
for
naturalization
either.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
other
version,
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
well,
the
court
of
appeals
was
fairly
strong
in
its
language.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
well,
not
on
that
particular
issue.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
well,
when
it
came
to
that
particular
issue,
they
indicated
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
government
had
knowledge.
in
any
event,
i
don't
have
the
exact--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--page
of
it,
but
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice,
that
indeed
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
that
particular
issue
said
with
respect
to
the
residence
in
kedainiai,
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
that
finding
was
not
material.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
they
addressed
it,
i
believe,
in
its
totality
when
they
had
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
disclosure
of
the
truth
of
the
residence
in
kedainiai
would
not
have
been
material.
it
would
not
have
been
material
in
the
context
of
the
case
either
to
the
visa
application
or
to
the
grant
of
citizenship
since
those
are
both
of
the
issues.
and,
indeed,
since
we're
attempting
to
fall
back
the
naturalization
representations
back
at
the
visa
stage
to
go
to
the
question
of
illegal
procurement,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
that
finding
by
the
district
court
and,
in
effect,
the
indication
not
only
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
wasn't
clearly
erroneous,
but
that
they
agreed
with
it
indicted
that
my
version
of
it
i
think
is
supported
by
the
record.
i
have
noticed
that
my
light
is
on.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
thank
you,
your
honor.
addressing
the
question
which
justice
stevens
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
i
had
overstated
what
the
government
had
conceded
in
the
brief
in
fedorenko,
i
was
interpreting
section
10
of
the
displaced
persons
act.
the
key
language
which
they
say
implied
in
that
brief
a
coterminous
requirement
of
materiality
in
illegal
procurement
was
the
phrase
"to
gain
admission".
i
submit
that
there
is
no
difference
in
kind
between
the
phrase
1101(f)(6).
so
although
the
government
wasn't
addressing
1106
at
that
time,
it
was
because
of
the
fact
that
they
recognized
that
the
displaced
person
argument
to
gain
admission
equaled
material.
it
follows
a
fortiori
that
that
would
also
be
material.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
i
think
that
you
gave
it
that
force,
mr.
justice
marshall,
when
you
speak
for
the
majority
in
fedorenko
said,
we
agree
with
the
government
that
section
10
requires
materiality.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes,
i
think
it's
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
that
gave
it
that
force.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
i
would
also
argue
that
a
fortiori,
the
reason
the
government
didn't
raise
the
argument
at
that
time
because
they
did
not
perceive
that
it
would
be
persuasive.
but
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
made
a
finding
when
it
simply
was,
in
effect,
addressing
itself
to
the
question
of
the
check
mark
on
to
gain
admission,
i
think
that
the
court
in
context
was
simply
indicating
that
the
same
misrepresentation
was
repeated
in
the
petition,
because
that
was
contained
on
page
120
of
the
appendix
c.
but
if
you
go
back
to
page
118,
the
court
makes
a
finding.
it
says,
"i
cannot
understand
what
benefit
defendant
expected
to
achieve
by
placing
his
birth
in
kaunas
rather
than
reistru,
by
dating
his
birth
october
4,
1913
rather
than
september
21,
1915.
"
and
the
finding
that
had
defendant
given
the
correct
information,
his
visa
would
have
nevertheless
been
issued.
later
on
in
the
opinion
at
page
123,
the
court
simply
reasserts
that
the
government
asserts
that
he
lacked
the
prerequisite
of
good
moral
character
because
he
gave
false
testimony
for
purpose
of
gaining
benefits
under
the
act.
that's
not
a
finding
of
fact.
that's
a
conclusion
of
law.
it's
an
erroneous
conclusion
of
law,
because
of
the
fact
of
the
requirement
materiality
as
perceived
in
fedorenko.
in
any
event,
there
is
no
testimony
presented
by
the
government
at
the
district
court
level
as
to
what
the
petitioner's
intent
was
at
the
time
he
made
the
misrepresentation.
there
is,
however,
testimony
as
to
why
the
petitioner
in
german
gave
the
documents
that
he
did.
that
is
to
say,
why
did
he
make
everything
consistent
with
his
internal
lithuanian
passport,
and
everything
consistent
with,
and
i'd
point
to
the
joint
appendix,
and
the
joint
appendix
is
on
page
29,
exhibit
1(s).
that's
the
lithuanian
ex-political
prison's
certificate
dated
june
18,
1946,
and
the
significance
of
that
certificate
was
explained
in
the
testimony
at
the
district
court
level
that
the
purpose
why
the
lithuanian
committee
in
the
camps
were
giving
these
certificates
is
because
the
soviet
representatives
on
the
committee
were
screening
applicants
for
purposes
of
expatriation
to
the
soviet
union,
or
taking
them
out
of
the
camps.
and
this
further
exhibit
on
page
69,
exhibit
53(d),
in
which
it
confirms
that.
this
is
the
letter
of
the
war
department,
special
staff,
civil
division,
and
it
refers
to,
"an
intensive
screening
program
initiated
in
mid-june
1946.
"
the
exact
time
that
he
received
that
certification.
so
obviously
he'd
want
to
be
in
a
position
of
having
to
indicate
to
a
soviet
representative
in
the
camp
that
his
internal
lithuanian
passport--
