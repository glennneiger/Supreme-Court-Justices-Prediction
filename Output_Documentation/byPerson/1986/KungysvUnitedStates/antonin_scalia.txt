justice
scalia
was
this
speaking
of
1101,
or
was
it
1451?
justice
scalia
well,
he
may
be
quite
correct
in
what
he
says
there
as
far
as
1451(a)
is
concerned.
justice
scalia
i
thought
we
were
talking
here
about
a
materiality
requirement
for
1101(f)(6).
justice
scalia
shifting
the
burden
doesn't...
shifting
the
burden
of
who
has
to
prove
it
doesn't
change
what
has
to
be
proven.
justice
scalia
textually,
how
do
you
get
to
that?
justice
scalia
simply
because
they
lacked
it,
they
had
to
do
nothing
but
lack
it
at
the
time?
i
mean,
let's
suppose
they
made
no
misrepresentations
concerning
the
fact
that
they
had
been
convicted
of
a
murder
which
is
one
of
the
bases
of
bad
moral
character.
justice
scalia
no,
but
let
me
finish
my
question.
the
fact
is
that
this
individual
had
been
convicted
of
a
murder,
didn't
misrepresent
anything
about
it.
it
is
later
found
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
murder.
and
you
say
that
the
illegally
procured
language
in
1451
then
enables
the
government
to
back,
because
it
made
a
mistake
when
he
was
naturalized,
to
denaturalize
him.
justice
scalia
any
mistake
in
the
original
naturalization
can
form
the
basis
for
denaturalization
under
1451.
justice
scalia
you're
really
hanging
on
a
thin
string
if
you
have
been
naturalized
now,
aren't
you?
does
that
mean...
i
wanted
to
follow
up
on
that
if
you
don't
mind,
judge
scalia.
does
that
mean
a
habitual
drunkenness
is
a
basis
for
not
being
of
good
moral
character?
that
would
me,
i
understand
then,
that
the
government
would
always
be
open
to
review
the
past
history
of
any
naturalized
citizen
to
find
if
at
the
time
he
was
naturalized
he
was
in
fact
sufficiently
alcoholic
to
fit
into
that
category.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
don't
you
think
illegally
procured
means
something
different
from
received
without
proper
qualification?
don't
you
think
there
is
some
more
active
connotation
to
illegally
procured?
justice
scalia
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
i
hadn't
reexamined
the
fedorenko
case,
but
your
opponent
seemed
to
say
you
shifted
your
position.
is
that
correct?
justice
scalia
indeed,
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
that
and
a
materiality
requirement,
is
there?
justice
scalia
you
have
to
assume
that
the
person
is
stupid;
that
is
that
although
he
thinks
this
fact
does
not
have
any
significant
bearing
upon
whether
he
will
be
naturalized
or
not,
he
nonetheless
lies
about
it.
justice
scalia
--no
materiality?
justice
scalia
well,
not
only
that.
we
don't
really
know
from...
it's
not
only
secondhanded
sort,
but
it's
also
that
we
don't
know
what
test
the
court
was
using
with
respect
to
the
language
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
benefits.
justice
scalia
we
don't
know
that
that
court,
that
the
district
court
had
in
mind
the
same
theory
about
the
two
kinds
of
lies
about
age
that
you
have
just
given
us.
justice
scalia
no,
all
i
require
is
that
i
know
what
the
district
court
is
talking
about,
and
i
don't
really
know
what
the
district
court
means
here
by
false
testimony
to
obtain
benefits.
i
just
have
to
take
on
faith
that
it
means
what
you
say
that
phrase
means,
which
doesn't...
you
know,
that's
not
an
obvious
meaning.
justice
scalia
do
we
take
it
that
one
has
an
intent
to
procure
it
falsely
if
one
merely
has
an
intent
to
procure
what
he
believes
he
is
entitled
to
more
promptly
than
would
otherwise
occur;
is
that
an
intent
to
procure
it
falsely?
i
mean,
what
he
says
here
is
that
he
lied
about
his
age
and
his
place
of
birth
because
some
of
the
documents
that
he
had
that
had
been
prepared
by
the
germans
had
those
things
on
them.
and
in
order
to
facilitate
the
process,
he
was
worried
if
he
came
up
with
different
places
it
would
take
a
lot
longer.
but
in
his
mind
he
didn't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
where
he
was
born
really,
or
whether
was
a
couple
of
years
younger
or
older.
he
just
didn't
want
the
process
to
take
longer
than
it
otherwise
would.
now
is
that
intending
to
procure
it
falsely,
or
simply
to
facilitate
the
proper
procurement
of
it.
justice
scalia
is
there
a
finding
to
that
effect
that
that
couldn't
be
the
basis
of--
justice
scalia
--i
mean
it
depends
on
what
the
district
court
means
by--
justice
scalia
--to
obtain
benefits
which
you
and
i
agree
it
never
said
what
it
means
by
it.
justice
scalia
do
we
know
that
the
district
court
did
not
mean
that
by
to
obtain
benefits
when
it
said
had
not
previously
given
false
testimony
to
obtain
benefits
under
the
immigration...
do
we
know
that
that's
not
what
the
district
court
was
talking
about?
justice
scalia
you
know,
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that
came
to
this
country
who
were
given
different
names
at
ellis
island.
the
immigration
officer
couldn't
pronounce
the
name,
and
they
said,
well,
sam,
is
that
okay?
yeah,
that's
my
name
sam.
now
his
name
wasn't
sam.
did
he
give
that
name
to
procure
the
visa,
or
to
procure
admission
to
the
united
states,
falsely
to
procure?
justice
scalia
he
just
wants
to
facilitate
the
thing.
the
guy
will
never
learn
how
to
spell
salvator,
or
whatever
the
name
is,
and
the
officer...
it's
happened
very
often.
justice
scalia
no,
no,
there
is
no
evil
purpose
except
to
facilitate
getting
in.
i
don't
want
to
be
here,
you
know,
trying
to
straighten
out
what
the
proper
spelling
of
my
name
is.
he
says
sam,
what
do
i
care;
sam
is
fine.
justice
scalia
do
you
consider
that
facilitating
getting
in?
justice
scalia
just
to
facilitate...
to
make
it
quicker
so
the
fellow
doesn't
have
to
figure
out
how
to
spell
salvator.
justice
scalia
wow,
that's
a
tough
position,
and
i
think
there
are
probably
a
lot
of
people
that
are
excludable.
justice
scalia
mr.
klonoff,
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
but
your
time...
i
do
want
one
piece
of
information
that
i
don't
know
about
which
you
may
not
get
to.
do
we
know
in
this
crucial
phrase
of
the
district
court
saying
that
the
defendant...
his
documents
were
false
in
that
they
stated
that
defendant
had
not
previously
given
false
testimony
to
obtain
benefits,
we
have
already
gone
around
on
whether
it
knew
what
it
meant
by
"to
obtain
benefits".
did
it
know
what
it
meant
by
"false
testimony"?
do
we
know
that
the
district
court
was
interpreting
the
phrase
"false
testimony"
as
you
concede
in
your
brief
it
should
be
interpreted
to
refer
only
to
oral
testimony,
and
not
to
statements
in
writing,
oral
testimony
under
oath?
justice
scalia
we
don't
know
that.
justice
scalia
it's
not
materiality
that
we
are
worried
about;
illegally
procured.
it's
the
1101
provision
that
is
drawn
into
1451
by
the
phrase
"illegally
procured"
that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
case,
kungys
versus
united
states,
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
it
was
argued
last
term
and
we
argued
at
the
beginning
of
this
term
in
october.
the
case
originated
in
1982
when
the
united
states
filed
a
complaint
against
the
petitioner,
juozas
kungys,
seeking
to
denaturalize
him
on
various
grounds
including
that
he
had
misrepresented
the
date
and
place
of
his
birth
in
his
1947
visa
application
and
his
1954
naturalization
proceeding.
the
district
court
found
against
the
government
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
upholding
the
naturalization
on
the
ground
that
the
petitioner
had
procured
his
citizenship
by
making
misstatements
as
to
his
date
and
place
of
birth
that
were
material
as
that
term
was
explained
in
our
1960s
decision
in
chaunt
versus
united
states.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
denaturalization
was
not
appropriate
on
the
additional
ground
that
the
petition
or
citizenship
was
illegally
procured
because
his
false
testimony
showed
that
he
lack
the
requisite
good
moral
character
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
pass
on
another
ground
for
denaturalization
that
the
petitioner
had
participated
in
executing
over
2,000
lithuanian
citizens,
most
of
them
jewish
in
kedainiai,
lithuania
between
july
and
august
of
1941,
an
allegation
that
the
petitioner
denies.
we
reversed
the
judging
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
there
are
many
legal
issues
that
lead
to
that
conclusion
which
you've
prompted
a
number
of
separate
opinions.
i
shall
summarize
only
those
points
on
which
my
opinion
represents
the
views
of
the
majority
of
the
court.
with
respect
to
whether
the
petitioner
had
procured
his
citizenship
by
material
misrepresentations
within
the
meeting
8
u.s.c.
section
1451(a),
we
hold
that
the
proper
test
for
materiality
under
that
provision
is
whether
the
misrepresentations
or
concealments
can
be
shown
by
clear
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence
to
have
been
predictably
capable
of
affecting
that
is
to
have
a
natural
tendency
to
affect
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service's
decisions.
this
test
is
consistent
with
the
lower
federal
court's
uniform
understanding
of
the
materiality
concept
as
embodied
in
other
federal
statutes
criminalizing
false
statements
to
public
officials.
we
also
hold
that
under
section
1451(a)
as
in
other
context,
the
question
of
whether
a
misrepresentation
is
material
is
a
question
of
law
for
the
court
to
decide
rather
than
a
question
to
be
decided
by
the
trier
of
fact.
finally,
we
addressed
the
proper
standard
for
denaturalization
under
the
illegally
procured
clause
of
section
1451(a)
which
includes
procurement
by
one
who
does
not
have
good
moral
character
as
defined
in
section
1101(f)(6)
because
he
has
given
false
testimony
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
immigration
or
naturalization
benefits.
we
conclude
first
that
false
testimony
is
limited
to
the
making
of
false
oral
statements
under
oaths
and
second,
that
the
false
testimony
must
have
been
given
for
the
subjective
purpose
of
obtaining
immigration
benefits.
once
the
government
establishes
these
two
elements
however,
which
it
must
do
as
for
all
matters
relating
to
denaturalization
by
clear
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence,
it
is
not
also
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
that
the
false
testimony
was
material.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
justice
stevens
