justice
o'connor
even
if
you
are
correct
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
materiality,
ordinarily
a
material
fact
is
one
that
is
important
to
the
decision-maker,
rather
than
one
that
is
necessarily
decisive.
isn't
there
a
difference
there?
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
materiality
means
it
has
to
be
a
fact
that
is
decisive
rather
than
something
merely
important
to
making
the
decision.
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
that's
debatable.
justice
o'connor
but
it
might
be
important
to
the
decision
whether
to
grant
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
we
think
it
means
just
important
to
the
decision?
justice
o'connor
mr.
klonoff,
did
the
district
court
in
this
case
ever
determine
the
purpose
for
which
the
petitioner
lied?
justice
o'connor
was
it
determined
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
immigration
benefits?
