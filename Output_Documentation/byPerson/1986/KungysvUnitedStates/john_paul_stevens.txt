justice
stevens
and
any
other
ground
that
would
show
a
lack
of
good
moral
character
at
the
time
remains
a
permanent
form
of
jeopardy
for
the
naturalized
citizen.
justice
stevens
well,
in
that
situation...
let
me
take
it
one
step
further.
supposing
a
person
realizes
that
although
he
inadvertently
did
disclose
some
disqualifying
circumstance
after
he
has
been
here
for
20
years
living
a
blameless
life,
he
realizes
that
there
is
this
blot
on
his
record.
is
there
any
way
he
can
correct
the
record?
can
he
come
in
and
say,
look,
i
made
this
mistake.
i
didn't
do
any...
you
know,
is
there
any
way
he
can
protect
himself
from
that
risk
by
making
appropriate
disclosures
20
years
later?
justice
stevens
well,
but
i
thought
the
statute
was
mandatory
on
1451(a).
justice
stevens
it
says
so
in
so
many
words.
justice
stevens
but
what
he
read
seemed
to
suggest
that
you
in
effect
conceded
that
it
would
not
apply.
justice
stevens
or
at
least
impose
any
higher
standard.
justice
stevens
so
any
position
you
advanced
in
fedorenko
would
still
be
your
position.
justice
stevens
we
can
rely
on
that.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
a
young
man
who
lies
about
his
age
to
get
into
the
marines
never
could
have
good
moral
character?
justice
stevens
under
your
argument,
i
would
think
he's
conclusively
presumed
to
have
bad
moral
character.
justice
stevens
but
at
the
naturalization
stage
could
he
have
acknowledged
that
he
had
lied
in
order
to
obtain
benefits
under
the
act;
namely,
a
visa
and
so
forth,
and
still
been
eligible
for
citizenship?
justice
stevens
no,
but
if
he
had
acknowledged,
would
he
have
been
eligible
for
citizenship?
justice
stevens
he
would
not
have
under
your
theory.
justice
stevens
then
how
do
you...
i
mean,
if
once
he
has
made
a
lie,
he's
hooked.
he's
got
to
stick
to
his
story
or
he
will
never
get
in.
isn't
that--
justice
stevens
--no,
no,
i'm
not.
but
i
don't
see
how
the
second
lie
really
compounds
the
first.
you
can
rely
just...
you
are
emphasizing
how
bad
he
was
by
saying
he
didn't
straighten
it
out
at
the
naturalization
stage.
but
he
couldn't
have.
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
the
lie
was
given
for
another
reason.
maybe
the
lie
was
given
for
another
reason,
but
he
knew
that
if
he
didn't
make
it
he
wouldn't
get
in,
because
he
can't.
once
he
has
lied...
having
committed
one
lie,
he's
through.
justice
stevens
and
one
lie
for
the
purpose
of
getting
some
benefit.
he
think
he
will
be
better
off
if
he
describes
himself
as
born
in
a
different
city,
and
that's
not
true.
justice
stevens
no,
no,
no.
i'm
assuming
with
you
the
first
lie
was
when
he
thought
he
had
to
misrepresent
his
age;
it
would
be
advantageous
to
him.
he's
dead.
justice
stevens
but,
of
course,
that's
only
true
if
we
buy
that
part
of
your
first
argument.
i
mean,
we
have
not
yet
read
illegal
procurement
quite
as
broadly
as
that,
i
think.
justice
stevens
of
course,
it
is
an
incentive,
it
is
perjury,
isn't
it
if
it...
and
so
the
incentive
is
to
be
willing
to
commit
a
crime?
justice
stevens
well,
at
the
naturalization
stage
though.
justice
stevens
some
deterrent.
