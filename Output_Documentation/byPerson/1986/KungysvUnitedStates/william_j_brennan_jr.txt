mr.
williamson,
suppose
these
lies
were
told
expressly
with
the
intention
of
getting
a
benefit
under
the
immigration
laws?
justice
jr.
would
that
not
be
a
material
misrepresentation?
and
if
he
succeeded
and
he
got
the
visa
because
the
lies
he
told
were
believed,
and
whoever
the
immigration
officer
was
consequently
accommodated
him
and
gave
him
the
visa.
justice
jr.
i
am
just
wondering
whether
or
not
he
did.
if
in
fact
they
were
told,
for
the
purpose
of
getting
something
from
the
immigration
officer,
and
he
succeeded,
wouldn't
that
end
the
inquiry?
justice
jr.
i
don't
know.
this
was
all
about
1947,
was
it?
justice
jr.
most
of
these
visas
were?
justice
jr.
and
we
had
a
great
many
immigration
officers,
i
gather,
handling
these
applications,
did
we
not?
justice
jr.
well,
suppose,
however,
there
were
an
administrative
practice
at
that
time
that
if
anyone
admitted
that
he
had
lied,
as
kungys
did,
that
automatically
he
would
be
denied
a
visa.
justice
jr.
i'm
just
asking
what
if
there
had
been.
justice
jr.
in
other
words,
if
he
didn't
confess
that
he
had
lied,
that
as
soon
as
they
detected
that
he
had
he
would
automatically
be
denied
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice.
justice
jr.
yes.
