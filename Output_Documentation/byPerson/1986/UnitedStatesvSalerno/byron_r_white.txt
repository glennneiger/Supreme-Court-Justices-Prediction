no
one
would
be
entitled
to
any
kind
of
a
hearing?
it
would
just
be
a
flat
stay
in
jail
until
you're
tried?
justice
white
but
it
wasn't
of
concern
to
the
court
of
appeals
here?
justice
white
well,
how
do
you
predict
that
a
defendant
may
kill
a
witness?
justice
white
what
do
you
have
to
have?
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
for...
or
if
he
were
out,
you
would
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
and
charge
him
with
that
crime?
justice
white
or
an
attempt,
or
what?
justice
white
well,
here
are
two
defendants
in
the
same
case,
and
one
of
them,
pretty
solid
evidence
turns
up
that
he's
about
to
kill
a
witness,
or
wants
to
kill
a
witness,
or
would
if
he
was
free;
and
his
codefendant,
it
is
found,
hasn't
got
any
real
plans
to
kill
a
witness,
but
he's
got
some
real
plans
to
kill
a
nonwitness,
just
somebody
else.
justice
white
you
could
hold
the
one
and
not
the
other?
justice
white
what
if
there's
a
bail,
but
there's
a
condition
on
bail:
you
don't
leave
the
jurisdiction;
you
don't
associate
with
certain
people;
and
you
don't
kill
anybody.
justice
white
then
you
have
solid
evidence,
a,
that
he
may
be
going
to
leave
the
jurisdiction.
justice
white
put
him
in
jail.
you
have
solid
evidence
that
he's
associating
with
people
he
shouldn't?
justice
white
third,
you
have
very
good
evidence
that
he's
about
to
kill
somebody?
justice
white
well,
but
then
you
say,
well--
justice
white
--you
just
are
about
to
violate
one
of
your
conditions,
so
we're
going
to
put
you
in
jail.
you're
about
to
violate
one
of
our
orders.
justice
white
that
is
something
that
you
didn't
think
the
framers
wanted
to
prevent
by
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
white
yes,
but
the
eighth
amendment
has
been
held
to
prevent
a
lot
of
things
that
used
to
be
accepted.
justice
white
so
what
about
bail
being
denied
in
a
capital
case?
justice
white
i
mean
today.
today.
not
way
back
then;
today.
justice
white
is
this
all
in
the
record?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
well,
you
don't...
what
you're
saying,
you...
even
if
you
were
permitted
to
challenge
this
provision
on
its
face,
it
sounds
like
you'd
get
a
lot
farther
challenging
it
as
it
applied
in
this
case?
