mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1966,
and
again
in
1984,
congress
restructured
and
rationalized
the
law
relating
to
pretrial
detention
of
persons
accused
of
crime.
the
guiding
principles
of
that
restructuring
was,
first
of
all,
to
minimize
the
amount
of
pretrial
detention;
and
subsidiary
to
that,
to
make
sure...
and
i
quote
from
the
statute
here...
that
a
judicial
officer
may
not
impose
a
financial
condition
that
results
in
pretrial
detention.
now,
complementary
to
that
principle
was
a
second
principle,
that
in
a
defined
class
of
serious
charges,
where
it
is
found
on
facts
established
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
no
conditions
will
reasonably
assure
the
appearance
of
the
person
as
required,
and
the
safety
of
any
other
person
in
the
community,
there
shall
be
detention
prior
to
trial.
factors
guiding
such
a
decision
are
set
out,
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
must
be
supported
by
reasons
given
in
writing.
now,
the
legislative
history...
and
most
observers
agree
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
1984
provision,
the
very
same
purposes,
the
purposes
of
protecting
the
community
were
accomplished
sub
rosa
by
the
setting
of,
in
effect,
impossibly
high
bail.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
accomplish
this
same
purpose,
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
community
against
pretrial
criminality
by
those
who
have
been
indicted,
by
a
frank
and
fair
and
open
proceeding,
which
puts
it
out
all
on
the
table,
and
allows
an
open
discussion
under
legislatively
defined
terms.
in
this
case,
the
respondents
were
charged
with
crimes
of
violence,
and
ordered
detained
after
two
lengthy
hearings
in
which
it
was
found
by,
and
i
quote
the
court,
overwhelming
evidence
that
they
were
lethally
dangerous;
that
if
returned
to
the
street
they
would
continue
business
as
usual;
and
that
business
involved
frequent
episodes
of
murder
and
mayhem.
now,
these
findings
and
the
procedure,
and
the
length
of
detention
suffered
here
are
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
this
case
presents
one
stark
proposition.
it
is
said
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
that
a
mere
prediction
or
concern
for
dangerousness
cannot,
consistently
with
substantive
due
process,
justify
detention
of
an
adult
charged
with
crime.
detention,
by
reason
of
feared
criminality,
can
only
be
effected
by
trial
and
conviction
by
the
usual
processes
of
criminal
law...
this
is
the
court
of
appeals'
proposition,
as
it
was
the
proposition
of
judge
newman
in
the
melendez-carrion
case
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
heavily.
now,
chief
judge
feinberg,
in
his
dissent,
sharpened
this
issue.
he
put
this
case.
a
member
of
a
terrorist
organization
has
been
indicted
for
blowing
up
an
airliner
for
political
reasons,
and
there
is
clear
and
persuasive
evidence
that
he
will
do
so
again
if
not
confined.
that
is
the
case
judge
feinberg
put.
and
the
court
of
appeals'
answer
was
clear.
the
court
of
appeals
stated:
even
the
risk
of
serious
crime,
such
as
destruction
of
an
airliner,
must
under
our
constitution
be
guarded
against
by
surveillance
of
the
suspect
and
prompt
trial.
i
would
suppose
that
it
is
an
inevitable
corollary
of
the
court
of
appeals'
proposition
that
even
if
such
an
accused
should
be
apprehended
again,
in
some
fresh
act
of
violence,
he
would
once
again
have
to
be
released
and
remain
at
large
until
finally
tried
and
convicted.
now,
what
justifies
so
extreme
and
counter-intuitive
a
proposition?
first
of
all,
no
authority
of
this
court
plainly
holds
that
way.
respondents,
although
not
the
court
of
appeals,
argue
that
the
detention
here
is
punitive.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
detention
is
incapacitive,
and
that
punitive
detention
also
is.
but
if
all
detention
were
punitive,
then
the
detention
of
juveniles,
of
deportable
aliens,
of
persons
thought
to
be
associated
with
the
enemy
in
wartime,
of
insane
persons,
would
also
be
punitive.
and
it's
quite
plain
that
that
is
not
the
case.
punishment
is
pain
or
disability
inflicted
for
a
past
offense
in
order
to
exact
retribution
or
to
make
an
example
of
the
offender.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
in
fact,
there
are
even
more
telling
examples
which,
if
you
like,
put
it
to
us.
judge
newman
put
the
case
of
a
person
who
has
been
acquitted
on
a
technicality
of
some
such
offense,
and
at
the
trial
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
this
is
an
extremely
dangerous
person
who
has
done
very
bad
things;
or
a
person
who
has
served
his
sentence
and
is
now
free.
now,
i
think
all
of
those
cases
make
the
point
about
what
kind
of
a
statute
this
is.
this
is
a
statute
which
is
intended
to
be
ancillary
to...
it
is
clearly
auxilliary
to...
the
normal
working
of
the
criminal
process.
it's
like
the
usual
detention
of
a
person
who
it
is
feared
might
flee,
or
might
intimidate
witnesses.
this
is
not...
this
is
not
a
free
standing
attempt
to
supplant
or
to
have
a
predictive
regime
replace
the
normal
criminal
law.
the
criminal
charge
is
there.
and
this
is
a
way
of
dealing
with
a
problem
in
the
interim.
it's
not
a
independent
way
of
getting
at
dangerous
people.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
this
to
be
a
punitive...
a
punitive
statute
or
to
have
a
punitive
purpose.
rather
it
was
found
to
be
regulatory
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
detention
in
schall
v.
martin
was
regulatory;
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
detention
in
greenwood
was
regulatory.
and
the
question
is:
is
the
regulation
here
justified?
does
the
regulation
not
impose
too
heavily?
is
the
government's
justification
for
that
regulation
not
insufficient?
that's
the
question
which
the
court
of
appeals
faced,
and
we
think
that
is
the
correct
question.
now,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
burden
here
on
the
individual
is
indeed
a
heavy
burden.
and
there
is
no
doubt,
therefore,
that
the
government
bears
a
weighty
burden
of
justifications.
now,
the
respondents
argue
that
no
justification
will
work;
that
no
justification
is
sufficient
to
permit
the
detention
on
account
of
dangerousness
of
an
adult,
competent
citizen
in
time
of
peace.
now,
of
course,
all
this
line,
which
the
respondent
draws...
adult,
competent,
time
of
peace,
citizen
not
alien...
what
this
line
represents
is
a
compendium
of
all
of
this
court's
cases
in
which
it
was
said
that
regulatory
detention
would
be
permissible.
and
it's
not
surprising,
since
this
is
a
new
scheme,
and
the
court
granted
certiorari
to
decide
an
issue
it
has
not
previously
decided,
that
the
line
so
drawn
will
not
pass
through
this
case.
but
the
principles
of
this
court,
we
think,
plainly
dispose
of
this
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondents
do,
i
think,
raise
a
serious
and
important
issue
about
detention
as
regulation.
they
are
concerned
that
what
is
undoubtedly
a
regulatory
scheme
here
should
not
oust
the
familiar
constitutionally
structured
system
for
redressing
crime
by
condemnation
and
punishment
and
replace
it
with
a
forward-looking
regulatory
scheme
of
detention,
however
fair
and
procedurally
nice
it
might
be.
the
picture,
i
suppose,
that
worries
them
is
the
world
of
the
novel
of
the
clockwork
orange,
or
what
happens
in
some
other
countries,
which
we're
very
glad
not
to
live
in.
and
that
is
why
judge
newman's
anomalies,
which
justice
scalia
referred
to,
are
indeed
appropriate
concerns.
now,
i
confess
that
these
anomalies
and
this
concern
makes
me
nervous
too,
as
does
the
idea
of
displacing
the
criminal
law
as
the
paradigm
for
dealing--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
eighth
amendment
was
not
part--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
was
not
urged,
and
it
was
not
part
of
the
decision
below.
mr.
charles
fried
i'm
not
aware
that
an
argument
was
made
on
the
basis
of
the
eighth
amendment,
and
if
it
were,
it
would
quite
properly
have
been
rejected.
because
the
eighth
amendment,
as
we
understand,
and
simply
looking
at
the
text
of
the
amendment,
says
there
shall
be
no
unreasonable
bail
in
a
case
where
bail
is
provided.
here,
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
bail,
and
so
we
don't
think
the
eighth
amendment
comes
into
the
question,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
fried
there
is
a
provision
for
bail
under
some
circumstances.
mr.
charles
fried
i'm
not
sure
who
first
raised
it,
but
by
the
time
it
got
here,
it
was
gone.
it
was
not...
it
was
no
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
argument.
and
mr.
cardinale
will
correct
me,
but
i
believe
it
is
not
part
of
the
respondent's
argument.
mr.
charles
fried
it
would
be
unusual
to
affirm
on
a
ground
which
was
not
urged,
and
was
not
part
of
the
decision
below.
it
would
be
unusual.
i
wouldn't
want
to
instruct
you
how
to
do
your
job,
so
i
leave
that
at
that.
now,
the
statute
doesn't
force--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
might
say
that.
it
might
say
that
in
connection
with
a
system
of
appropriate
pretrial
release.
it
could
not
do
that
very
easily,
i
think,
on
the
ground...
in
connection
with
a
system
where
all
persons
accused
of
crime
are
all
to
be
held
pending
their
trial
and
conviction.
that
would
be
a
different
system.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
that
would
violate,
if
it
violated
anything,
due
process.
it
would
violate
the
same
constitutional
provisions
which
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondents
urge
are
violated
by
the
provision...
by
the
procedures
here.
mr.
charles
fried
it
would
be
because
persons
would
be
deprived
of
their
liberty
for
insufficient
reasons,
for
inappropriate
and
insufficient
reasons.
mr.
charles
fried
the
violation,
if
it
were
one,
would
be
one
of
substantive,
not
procedural,
due
process,
justice
white.
of
course,
this
is
very
far
from
being
the
present
system.
indeed,
the
system
envisaged
by
the
1984
act
is
seeking
to
do
the
very
opposite.
it
is
seeking
to
minimize
the
use
of
money
to
assure
the
presence
and
proper
behavior
of
a
person
charged
with
crime
while
at
the
same
time
taking
those
few
people
who
are
a
danger
or
who
might
flee
and
putting
them
in
jail
for
that
reason
and
not
for
a
kind
of
sub
rosa
reason
that
they
can't
make
a
$3
million
bail.
mr.
charles
fried
justice
scalia,
there's
no
doubt
that
this
system
assumes
that
some
measure
of
prediction
is
possible.
so
has
this
court,
in
schall
v.
martin,
so
did
this
court
in
jurek
v.
texas.
and
so
would
common
sense.
there
is
a
question,
of
course:
how
are
you
going
to
calibrate
the
prediction?
how
many
false
positives
will
you
tolerate?
and
i
suppose
in
future
cases
which
raise
the
issue
of
the
proper
level
of
prediction,
which
this
case
does
not...
in
future
cases,
you
may
wish
to
address
that
question.
but
in
this
case,
that
is
not
a
problem
unless
you
are
prepared
to
say
that
one
can
never
predict
dangerousness,
in
no
circumstances.
and
that,
i
think,
is
an
extreme
proposition
which
this
court
has
already
rejected.
mr.
charles
fried
over
dissents.
that
is
so
often
the
case,
justice
blackmun.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
fried
i
suppose
there
were
dissents
within
the
american
psychiatric
association,
but
i
doubt
they
publish
them
in
the
same
way.
[laughter]
the
point
about
this
statute
is
that
it
is
purely
ancillary
to
the
regular
working
out
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
that
is
why
the
clockwork
orange
scenario
does
not
trouble
me,
as
it
might,
under
judge
newman's
hypotheticals.
the
idea
is
that
this
power
is
brought
into
life
only
when
the
government
seeks
to
try
and
convict
a
person;
it
exists
only
so
long
as
it
is
seeking
to
do
it;
and
when
it
has
done
so,
or
when
it
has
failed
to
do
so,
or
when
the
charges
have
been
dismissed,
the
power
vanishes
with
it.
and
i
think
that
is
the
main
difference
between
this
and
the
kinds
of
things
that
we're
being
frightened
with,
and
that
i
must
say,
frighten
me
as
well.
now,
what
i
view
this
as,
and
how
i
urge
the
court
to
look
at
this,
is
as
an
interim
response
until
or
so
that
the
normal
criminal
processes
can
reach
their
conclusion.
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
rather
blithely
says,
oh
well,
what
you
do
in
the
interim
is,
you
get
prompt
trial.
but
that's
a
never-never
land.
we
don't
live
in
a
world
where
you
can
get
prompt
trial.
in
serious
cases
preparation
for
trial
and
motions
take
time.
the
court
of
appeals
says,
well,
therefore
you
have
to
take
care
of
this
by
surveillance.
but
we
live
in
a
world
which
is
anonymous,
which
is
crowded,
which
is
not
the
world
of
the
15th
century.
and
it's
not
always
possible
to
keep
tabs
on
people
by
surveillance.
what
this
statute
does,
it
fills
the
gap
created
by
the
delay,
which
is
inevitable--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
a
number
of
judges,
and
serious
and
respected
judges,
have
certainly
thought
that
the
period
of
detention,
and
indeed,
the
reasons
why
the
period
of
detention
might
be
quite
long,
bear
on
the
due
process
of
this
provision.
and
in
an
appropriate
case,
which
this
is
not...
because
that
issue
has
not
been
raised...
in
an
appropriate
case,
the
length
of
detention
might
well
become
an
issue
for
this
court's
determination.
mr.
charles
fried
it
was
not
of
concern
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
any
delay,
no
matter
how
brief,
violates
the
constitution.
that
is
why
i
say,
we
have
a
very
stark
proposition
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
fried
there
have
been
11
months
in
this
case.
we
don't
know
why
there
have
been
11
months;
whether
the
11
months
have
been
laid
at
the
door
of
the
government,
at
the
door
of
the
defendants.
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
me
to
seek
to
allocate
that
blame
in
a
case
where
that
is
simply
not
an
issue.
i
might--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
i
should
say
first
that
in
this
case,
those
rebuttable
presumptions
were
not
invoked.
mr.
charles
fried
those
rebuttable
presumptions
have,
i
believe,
universally
been
interpreted
by
the
courts
of
appeals
to
simply
shift
the
burden
of
going
forward
onto
the
defendant,
the
burden
of
going
forward
as
to
dangerousness.
in
those
courts
of
appeal,
the
presumption
then
remains
in
the
case,
as
it
were,
as
a
bit
of
evidence,
but
they
are
not...
they
are
not
dispositive,
and
they
have
not
been
treated
in
that
way.
once
again,
i
think
with
a
new
scheme
like
this,
it
would
be
much
better
to
confront
the
issues
raised
by
those
presumptions
in
a
case
where
really
they
were
litigated
and
there
was
a
real
worry
about
them.
i
note
that
the
respondents,
on
the
very
last
page
of
their
brief,
shrink
from...
it
seems
to
me
they
shrink
from
the
conclusion...
that
society
is
entirely
helpless
to
protect
itself
against
a
determined
lawbreaker
who
is
apprehended
in
several
acts
of
violence
while
awaiting
trial.
for
they
say,
on
that
last
page,
that
in
that
case,
there
might
be
detention
for
violation
of
the
conditions
of
release.
perhaps
the
only
difference,
then,
between
the
respondents
and
us
is
that
they
seem
to
think
that
due
process
absolutely
requires
one
bite
at
the
apple
of
post-indictment
criminality.
i
don't
see
why.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
charles
fried
a
number
of
factual
matters.
there
is
a
extensive
record,
extensive
appendix,
available
for
the
hearings.
there
were
two
hearings
before
two
different
judges.
i
don't
agree
with
the
characterization
of
those
hearings
as
perfunctory.
but
if
mr.
cardinale
believes
they
were--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
have
no
idea,
justice
marshall.
but
these
two
motions
fill
two
very
large
volumes
of
records.
if
mr.
cardinale
had
felt
those
rather
extensive
hearings
were
perfunctory,
then
he
should
have
made
an
objection
on
that
score,
and
allowed
this
court
to
consider
it
on
that
basis.
mr.
cardinale
refers
to,
and
the
court
referred
to,
conditions
of
release.
one
of
the
conditions
of
release,
a
mandatory
condition
of
release,
and
a
traditional
one
is,
that
a
person
released
pretrial
is
subject
to
the
condition
that
he
not
commit
a
federal,
state
or
local
crime
during
the
period
of
release.
the
case
that
haunts
me
is
this:
a
person
is
released
on
that
condition,
perhaps
as
a
result
of
mr.
cardinale's
argument.
he
then
does
indeed
commit
such
a
crime.
what
is
to
be
done
about
such
a
person?
i
take
it
on
the
logic
of
the
argument,
and
on
the
logic
of
the
argument
of
the
court
below,
he
must
again
be
released
pending
conviction.
and
if
he
commits
yet
another
crime,
he
must
again
be
released,
until
such
time
as
there
is
a
conviction.
that,
i
think,
is
a
situation,
describes
a
state
of
affairs,
describes
a
mode
of
criminal
procedure,
which
i
don't
think
we
are
constitutionally
required
to
admit
in
the
face
of
a
reasonable
statute
which
seeks
to
do
the
opposite.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
