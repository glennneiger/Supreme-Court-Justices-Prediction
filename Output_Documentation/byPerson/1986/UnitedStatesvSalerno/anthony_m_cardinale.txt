mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
may
it
please
the
court,
justices:
as
i
listen
to
general
fried's
address,
i
must
confess
that
i
got
more
and
more
afraid
of
what
i
perceive
in
this
issue
before
the
court
a
very
great
danger.
and
the
danger
is
not
only
to
the
rights
of
mr.
salerno,
the
rights
of
mr.
cafaro,
but
to
everyone's
rights.
because
up
until
this
point,
i
think
i
certainly
have
lived
under
the
assumption,
and
have
practised
law
under
the
assumption,
that
you
got
punished,
you
went
to
jail,
only
after
the
government
was
able,
after
trial,
after
proof
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
to
inflict
punishment.
and
i
think
that's
the
starting
point,
certainly,
of
our
brief,
and
the
starting
point
of
the
issues
now
before
this
court.
in
response
to
what
justice
marshall
brought
up
about
the
eighth
amendment,
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
we
didn't
drop
the
ball.
the
eighth
amendment
is
a
very,
very
vital
part
of
our
argument
in
this
case.
it's
a
vital
part
as
that
right
is
encompassed
within
every
defendant's
due
process
rights,
substantive
due
process
rights.
because
they
don't
just
deal
with
one
simple
right
versus
another,
but
embodied
in
the
substantive
due
process
claim
that
we
make,
and
a
very
large
part
of
it,
is,
that
the
eighth
amendment
must
mean
something.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
prior
decisions,
particularly
stack
v.
boyle,
where
you
found...
and
the
language
used
there
i
don't
believe
can
be
termed
mere
dicta...
but
the
language
speaks
of
the
right
to
bail
in
certain
circumstances.
to
be
sure,
our
argument
is
not
that
there
is
a
right
to
bail
in
each
and
every
case.
for
there
is
certainly
historical
reasons,
and
valid
ancillary
reasons,
to
the
criminal
justice
system
to
deny
bail
in
very
extreme
circumstances,
and
only,
i
submit,
where
the
risk
to
society
is
not
that
there's
going
to
be
danger,
or
that
perhaps
we
can
predict
somehow
that
there
will
be
a
crime
committed
by
this
individual,
but
only
where
the
threat
to
the
system
is
that
he
will
not
reappear,
subject
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
or
where
the
actions,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
actions
may
demonstrate
to
the
courts
that
this
individual
is
a
dangerous
to
particular
persons
who
are
necessary
to
the
very
operation
of
the
particular
function
that
the
court
is
about
to
embark
on.
now,
what
we
say,
again,
if
stack
v.
boyle
is
to
mean
anything,
and
certainly
in
reference
to
the
dissents
that
were
brought
up,
if
the
dissents
in
the
carlson
v.
landon
case
are
to
mean
anything,
the
eighth
amendment
is
very
much
a
part
of
this
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
no.
and
i
say
that
only
because
of
the
very
particular
facts
that
the
court
addressed
in
carlson
v.
landon,
facts,
as
we
point
out,
and
as
general
fried
must
agree,
facts
that
are
very
dispositive
in
their
distinction
with
the
facts
before
the
court
and
the
issue
before
the
court.
in
carlson
v.
landon,
it
wasn't
a...
it
was
not
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
the
court,
very
easily,
in
those
circumstances,
i
submit,
perhaps
too
easily...
but
that's
my
personal
view
as
opposed
to
what
the
jurisprudence
shows...
said
that
the
eighth
amendment
in
these
circumstances,
and
bail,
simply
doesn't
apply.
in
conjunction
with
that,
we
had
a
very,
very
strong
right
that
the
court
recognized
in
carlson
v.
landon
that
the
executive
branch
has
to
keep
out
of
our
country,
whether
by
expulsion
or
refusal
to
enter,
aliens;
in
that
case,
those
that
were
deemed
to
be
dangerous.
so
those
are
the
types
of
dispositive
differences
that
i
think
are
made
up
in
each
one
of
the
examples
that
we
have
brought
to
this
court's
attention
that
have,
in
the
past,
allowed
for
preventive
detention,
as
it
were.
and
they
do
not
exist
in
this
case.
schall
v.
martin,
we
point
out,
i
believe
very
aptly,
is
like
the
mental
deficient
cases,
a
situation
where
you
have
not
only
an
admitted
societal
interest
being
propounded
and
enforced
by
the
government,
that
is,
the
safety
of
the
community,
but
also,
a
very
necessary
dual
purpose
without
which,
i
submit,
this
court
would
not
have
come
to
the
conclusion
it
did.
and
that
dual
purpose
being
that
there
was
a
subject
of
that
preventive
detention
who
was
not
clearly
free
of
detentive
aspects
in
general;
it
was
always,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out,
juveniles
always
in
some
form
of
custody.
and
in
a
situation
where
the
custodial
interests
of
the
parents
of
this
individual
had
somehow
broken
down,
and
it
was
not
the
duality
coming
in,
the
state's
parens
patria
power,
in
conjunction
with
the
very
specific
interest
in
protecting
society.
that
duality
you
see
throughout
the
only
cases
that
this
court
has
ever
addressed.
there
has
always
been
a
conjunction
between
not
only
the...
the
government
interest
in
protecting
society,
but
also
the
party
to
whom
this
protection
was
being
addressed.
and
it
deals
again,
with
aliens,
with
incompetents,
with
juveniles.
but
it
has
never,
and
this
court
has
never
held,
that
it
would
ever
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
apply
to
the
people
we
describe
as
competent
adult
citizens.
now,
general
fried
makes
a
very
big
distinction,
saying
that,
well,
the
respondents
can't
simply
carve
out
a
niche,
a
new
class,
that
has
heretofore
never
existed.
i
somewhat
agree
with
that
analysis,
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
a
class
that
is
being
carved
out;
but
we're
talking
about
99.999
percent
of
the
population,
and
people
about
whom
this
courthas
never
had
to
step
over
the
line
and
address
the
issues
that
thiscase
brings
before
the
court.
you've
never
had
to
do
that
when
you
were
faced,
again,
with
competent
citizens
who
were
adults.
and
there
is
no
effort
to
gerrymander,
as
the
court
puts
it,
the
prior
jurisprudence
of
this
court
in
an
effort
to
create
something
that
doesn't
exist.
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
case
about
this
demonstrates,
i
submit,
exactly
our
point:
that
there
is
no
need
to
make
such
distinctions.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
i
don't...
i
assume,
justice
o'connor,
what
you're
referring
to
is
the
government's
argument,
or
general
fried's
argument,
about
the
sub
rosa
practice
that
went
on
in
the
past.
i
think,
and
i
strongly
urge
this
court,
the
fact
that
the
government
would
agree
that
that
was
sub
rosa
indicates
quite
clearly
that
it
wasn't
proper
before,
and
it
is
now
the
very
first
time
in
criminal
jurisprudence
in
this
country,
is
it
now
proper
in
federal
courts
to
take
that
into
consideration.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
point.
if
it
was
done
sub
rosa,
again,
justice
o'connor,
it
was
done
concededly
improperly,
and
never
before--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--i
believe
you're--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--i
believe
that's
exactly
what
stack
v.
boyle
dealt
with,
in
particular,
when
it
related,
as
this
case
must
also
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
the
fact
that
one
of
the
most
important
rights,
forgetting
about
obviously
the
harsh
penalties
we're
talking
about
here...
the
loss
of
liberty;
there
can
be
no
harsher
imposition
on
individuals
in
our
society...
but
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
a
situation
where
as
in
stack
v.
boyle,
chief
justice
vinson
pointed
out,
the
right
to
bail
in
these
circumstances
is
necessary
to
enable
someone
to
fairly
meet
the
prosecutor's
challenge.
and
without
that
opportunity,
i
submit
to
the
court,
there
is
a
drastic
difference
between
what
an
individual
may
be
prepared
to
submit
himself
to
than
if
he
were
free
and
able
to,
in
the
best
way
he
can,
assist
in
the
preparation
of
the
defense.
and
that's
certainly
been
part
of
what
the
stack
v.
boyle
case
mentioned;
certainly
the
dissents
in
carlson--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--yes,
your
honor,
certainly.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
we
have
to
do--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
you
have
to
again
combine
the
eighth
amendment
with
the
fifth
amendment
dues
process
rights.
and
i
submit
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
explicitly
put
that
language
in
there...
and
of
course
there
is
debate
among
the
academics
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
a
drafting
error
or
not;
whether
or
not
it
should
have
said,
except
in
capital
cases
where
the
proof
is
evident
or
the
presumption
great,
which
has
been
the
historical
basis
of
the
denial
for
bail--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--i
think
there
would
be
no
reasons
for
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
have
included
such
language
if
it
were
up
to
the
legislature,
at
their
whim,
to
decide
when
and
if
crimes
were
bailable
or
not.
i
submit
that
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
would
have
to
find
to
uphold
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
that
it
was--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--i
don't
mean
to
disagree,
justice
scalia.
but
i
submit
that
what
they
were
really
intended
to
do
was
to
prevent
legislatures
from
acting
the
way
they
have,
in
my
view,
in
this
case;
and
that
is,
by
some
quick
magic
formula,
changing
and
altering
what
has
been
the
tradition
and
foundational
basis
for
bail,
because
they
think
it's
a
good
simple
answer
to
a
very
complex
question,
and
one
which,
i
submit,
may
turn
around
some
day
and
swallow
up
the
very
legislators
that
are
enacting
this.
and
i
don't--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--i
understand,
and
i
appreciate
the
court's
position
about
where
it
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
is
historically
directed.
but
i
submit
that
if
it
was...
it
was,
at
the
same
time,
directed
at
the
lawmakers.
while
it
certainly
dealt
in
terms
of
explicit
terms
about
excessive
bail,
and
that
can
obviously
be
directed
toward
the
judiciary,
it
also
has
to
mean
something...
the
eighth
amendment
has
to
mean
something
more
than,
simply,
you
can
have
the
legislature,
at
its
whim,
what
is
not
a
bailable
offense.
now,
we
submit
that
what
happens
in
cases
like
these...
and
again,
our
first
argument
is
interrelated
with
the
second,
and
they
all
deal
with
substantive
due
process,
i
submit...
is
that
what
we
do
have
here
is
punishment.
it's
not
regulation.
no
matter
how
you
look
at,
no
matter
what
you
want
to
call
it,
when
you
break
it
down
and
test
it
within
the
formulations
that
this
court
has
heretofore
announced,
it
comes
up
as
punishment.
there
is
no
other
way
to
look
at
it.
and
certainly,
if
the
court
were
to
come
to
that
conclusion,
that
is
obviously
the
simple
answer
to
this.
now,
in
the--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--no,
not...
it
is
ancillary,
i
submit,
and
the
court
must
make
this
distinction,
it
is
ancillary
to
the
justice
system
to
protect
its
ability
to
function
normally;
just,
for
example,
why
it
would
be
okay
for
a
very
preliminary
detention
of
an
individual
to
get
the
jurisdiction
to
attach,
just
as
it
would
be
ancillary
to
the
justice
system
to
stop
somebody
from
leaving
the
jurisdiction
and
never
coming
back.
and
similarly,
that
is
something
that
is
directed
very
squarely
at
the
functioning,
and
therefore,
very
much
more
ancillary
to
the
judicial
system.
my
position,
quite
simply,
and
certainly
in
contradistinction
to
general
fried's
argument,
that
this
punishment
here,
this
pretrial
detention,
is
ancillary
to
the
criminal
justice
system
in
the
same
way
actual
penalties
and
prison
sentence
are...
prison
sentences
are,
in
the
same
system.
i
just
don't
believe
that
it
is
not
punishment,
where
the
only
reason
someone
is
being
placed
in
jail,
away
from
his
family,
away
from
his
job,
away
from
his
attorney,
is
because
somehow
or
another
the
government
has
decided
that
we
can
predict
that
this
person
will
be
a
danger.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
well,
i
think
that
you
don't...
if
the
case
law
in
that
regard,
your
honor--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--i
think,
your
honor--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--that
each
case
involving
threats
to
the
judicial
system
rise
and
fall
on
their
own
facts.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
hard
and
fast
ruling.
one
case
that
comes
to
mind
is
the
godde
case
which
preceded
the
salerno
case
in
the
second
circuit,
and
a
very
recent
case,
where
they
found,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
he
was
a
threat
to
the
judicial
system.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
well,
i
don't...
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
distinctions--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--i
think
the
distinctions
are
very
dispositive.
one
is
that
you
have
something,
an
act,
directed,
that
you
have
evidence
about
an
act
directed
to
the
functioning
of
the
judicial
system;
and
the
other,
you
have
some
amorphous
belief
that
this
person,
whether
it's
because
of
his
background,
social
status,
color
perhaps,
is
more
likely
to
commit
a
crime.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
because
it's
not
a
crime,
your
honor,
to
think
about
and
even
plan
mentally
to
kill
somebody
in
our
society.
it's
only
when
some
act
is
undertaken
in
that
regard.
there's
the
difference.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
it
isn't
a
crime
a
to
think
about
it,
and
i
don't
think
that
if
that
were
the
only
evidence,
that
we
would
have
an
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
well,
i
think
the
tradition
of
our
system,
in
terms
of
the
bail...
bailability,
if
you
will,
of
individuals,
is
that
where
you
can
determine
it
to
be
very
much
ancillary
to
the
ability
for
the
function
of
the
judiciary
to
continue
and
to
bring
this
person
to
justice,
that
is
one
standard.
as
to
the
other
standard,
i
submit,
your
honor,
even
with
equal
evidence,
the
unfortunate,
perhaps,
but
only
constitutional
remedy
is
surveillance,
and
certainly,
going
to
mr.
x
and
saying,
by
the
way,
we
have
some
information,
you
better
lay
low,
or
do
you
want
to
come
in
and
we'll
protect
you.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
i
understand
that.
but
i
think
that
in
the...
from
practical
experience,
the
notion
of
someone
being
dangerous
to
the
judicial
system
to
the
point
that
he's
considering
one
witness,
there
may
very
well
more
easily
be
an
inference
drawn
by
the
trier
of
fact
that--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--that's
right.
that's
usually
part
of
it.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
put
him
in
jail.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
put
him
in
jail.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
no.
and
the
reason
you
stop
is--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--unless--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--i
think
again
what
we're
dealing
there
is
predictive
behavior.
and
you
can't,
i
think...
if
the
action
of
the
individual
was
not
a
direct
violation
of
a
condition,
or
a
direct
sufficient
act
to
engage
the
police
power
of
a
state
by
an
arrest,
you
simply
can't
say,
we
have
evidence
that
you've
been
thinking
of
robbing
that
bank,
and
therefore,
because
we
saw
you
go
and
get
gloves
and
masks
and
everything,
therefore,
we
can
charge
you
with
that,
and
by
charging
you
with
that,
you're
now
violated,
if
he's
done
sufficient
actions
toward
that
end.
and
again,
we
have
actions
instead
of
prediction.
and
i
think
that
that's
where
the
fatal
flaw
in
this
whole
statutory--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--certainly.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
well,
i
think
under--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--well,
i
think
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
while
i
certainly
agree
that
congress
has
the
power,
and
certainly
the
duty,
to
be
concerned
about
the
public
welfare
and
safety,
when
it
comes
to
this
type
of
behavior,
the
balance,
unfortunately,
and
it's
the
only
way
to
look
at
this,
while
the
government's
position
is
that
you
can't
tell
me
that
the
constitution,
whether
it's
because
the
legislature
through
the
constitution
has
this
power,
or
any
other
power
inherent
in
the
constitution,
that
the
constitution
can
protect
the
judicial
system
but
cannot
protect
society
at
large.
i
disagree
with
that
vehemently.
it
can
protect
society
at
the
same
time.
but
when
you
have
the
balancing
factors
being...
like
this
case,
or
any
of
the
examples
we've
been
discussing,
the
constitution
must
protect
the
individual
and
society
at
the
same
time.
and
when
you
deal
with
predictive
behavior,
the
balance,
i
submit,
is
necessarily
on
the
side
of
the
individual.
and
it
has
to
be.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
it
is
constitutional,
and
it
has
been
held
from
time
immemorial
that
because
the
ultimate
sanction,
whether
again,
we
have
the
death
penalty
nowadays
or
not,
whether
because
the
ultimate
sanction
in
a
case
like
that
may
be
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
or
the
death
penalty,
that
because
that
would
give
somebody
a
very,
very
good
reason
to
leave
the
jurisdiction,
that
under
those
circumstances,
it's
a
fair
inference,
when,
again,
the
evidence
is
strong
and
the
presumption
great,
as
the
old
language
went,
to
constitutionally
deny
that
person
bail.
but
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--there
would
be
no
reason
for
him
to
stay
around
to
get
electrocuted.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
i'm
suggesting
that
they
didn't
want
to
prevent
the
judiciary
from
enacting
or
imposing
no
bail
situations
in
capital
offenses.
and
of
course,
going
back
into
the
old
history,
capital
offenses
included
petty
larceny
and
things
like
that.
so
i
think
if
you
go
back
to
the
english
precedents,
which
i
think
are
very
little
help
in
this
area,
and
the
older
ones
particularly,
everything
was
practically
a
capital
offense.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that
this
is
one--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--well,
it
wouldn't
in
that,
again,
based
upon
what
we
commonly
accept
as
the
tradition--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--today,
what
we
accept
as
the
traditional
reason
for
the
grant
or
denial
or
bail.
and
that
being...
the
foremost
one
being
whether
the
person
will
show
up
and
subject
himself
to
the--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--no,
because
there
was
no
evidence...
and
the
government
conceded
that...
there
was
no
evidence,
despite
everything
and
the
enormity
of
the
charges,
even
though
they
didn't
include
death
penalties,
they
certainly
added
up
to
an
excess
of
300
years,
the
government
submitted
in
that
circumstance
that
they
were
not
flight
risks;
they
were
not
at
all
concerned
that
these
people
wouldn't
come
back
when
their
time
came
to
appear,
and
go
through
trial,
and
be
sentenced,
if
necessary.
i
think,
again,
if
i
could,
with
the
short
period
of
time
i've
got
left,
i
really
think
we
need
to
address...
i
would
like
to
address...
the
issue
that
if
we
get
by
the
substantive
due
process
challenges
we
make,
when
you
assess
the
validity
of
the
statute,
you
must
look
at
what...
and
you
assess
also
whether
or
not
this
predictive
behavior
is
ever
a
proper
basis,
look
at
the
statute
as
to
what
actually
happens
in
fact
to
people
who
are
charged
in
federal
courts
nowadays?
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
no,
i
think
that
the
challenge
that
we're
making...
and
i
will
get
to
the
exact
facts
in
this
case,
because
i
think
they
do
shed
some
light
on
this
whole
area...
but
when
we
are
challenging,
facially,
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute,
that
includes
whether
or
not
they
were
applied
properly.
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
procedures
when
applied
to
this
case
or
any
case,
are
insufficient
to
maintain
the
constitutionality
on
a
due
process
basis
of
this
statute.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
well,
let
me...
yes,
i
think
in
this
respect.
in
this
case,
if
the
following...
ask
the
court
to
follow
the
following
scenario.
i
show
up
in
court.
i'm
handed
an
88-page
indictment
with
29
counts.
my
client,
mr.
salerno,
not
mr.
cafaro,
had
a
year
earlier
been
indicted
on
a
very
similar
type
case,
which
i
submit,
given
the
factual
predicate
of
that
indictment,
which
came
down
at
a
time
when
this
statute
was
in
effect,
where
there
were
several
more
murders,
and
a
conspiracy
of
dimensions
even
much
larger
than
the
one
in
this
case,
the
government
agreed,
in
front
of
a
magistrate,
to
a
$2
million
bail,
with
the
usual
conditions;
even
though
this
statute
was
in
place.
a
year
goes
by,
and
based
on
the
same
evidence,
i
submit,
a
new
charge
is
brought;
a
new
very
multiplicious
i
submit,
indictment,
a
wide
conspiracy;
same
evidence.
i
walk
into
court.
i'm
handed
an
88-page
indictment.
and
xx
told,
oh,
by
the
way,
we're
not
going
in
front
of
the
magistrate.
i
don't
know
why.
we
wind
up
in
front
of
a
judge.
how
that
happened,
i
still
don't
know,
because
the
practice
in
the
southern
district
as
i
understood
it,
and
as
my
client
had
a
year
earlier,
started
in
front
of
a
magistrate.
i
wind
up
in
front
of
the
part
one
judge.
the
government
tells
me,
they're
moving
for
detention.
i
ask
them:
why?
well,
we
don't
have
to
tell
you,
is
basically
the
answer.
you'll
find
out,
in
essence.
five
days
later,
i
walk
in,
the
government
gets
up,
gives
a
great
final
argument
on
untested
evidence--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--it
is
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
certainly.
gives
in
essence
a
final
argument.
no
witnesses.
no
cross-examination.
no
notice.
and
the
ballgame
was
over.
i
mean,
the
court
is
being
submitted
by
the
government...
their
position...
their
submission
is
that
this
is
all
part
of
a
main
event,
this
ancillary
jurisdiction
they
claim
to
hold
people,
the
main
event
being
the
criminal
trial.
if
they're
right,
and
i
can
find
no--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
do
that,
not
only
given
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
given
the
specific
language
and
the
lack
of
due
process,
we
submit,
are
inherent
in
the
statute.
in
conclusion--
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
--well,
it
took
as
long
as
the
government
took
to
give
its
recitation.
when
i
asked
to
produce
certain
witnesses,
i
was
denied
that
right.
and
it
was
very
quick
after
that,
let's
put
it
that
way.
mr.
anthony
m.
cardinale
in
my
view,
yes.
as
i
conclude
my
address,
may
it
please
the
court,
i'm
aware
that
the
issues
in
this
case
call
upon
this
court
to
act
and
to
perform
its
duty
in
perhaps
the
most
grave
and
delicate
of
matters.
i'm
asking
you
to
declare
constitutional...
unconstitutional,
an
act
of
the
legislature,
an
act
of
congress.
but
i'm
also
aware
at
this
time
that
there
are
hundreds,
and
perhaps
thousands,
of
individuals
being
held,
pretrial,
on
this
supposed
prediction,
and
are
being
punished,
as
we
stand
here;
and
everyday
that
goes
by,
it
gets
worse.
i
urge
the
court,
therefore,
to
affirm
the
court
below,
and
to
declare
this
statute
unconstitutional.
thank
you.
