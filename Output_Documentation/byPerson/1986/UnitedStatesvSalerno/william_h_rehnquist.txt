chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
86-87,
united
states
against
anthony
salerno
and
vincent
cafaro.
mr.
fried,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
general
fried.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cardinale.
you're
representing
mr.
cafaro
as
well
as
mr.
salerno?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
dissents
in
carlson
v.
landon
ought
to
mean
more
than
the
court
opinion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
refine
that
hypothesis
a
little
bit,
if
you
will,
mr.
cardinale.
supposing
that
you
have
equally
convincing
predictive
evidence
in
respect
to
each
of
the
defendants
referred
to
by
justice
white
that
a
would
kill
a
witness
and
b
would
kill
mr.
x
whom
he's
got
a
big
grudge
against
but
is
not
a
witness.
why
is
the
sanctity
of
the
judicial
system
somehow
much,
much
greater
than
the
sanctity
of
the
life
of
someone
not
involved
in
the
judicial
system?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it
a
crime
to
think
about
killing
a
witness?
chief
justice
rehnquist
supposing
exactly
the
same
degree
of
evidence
is
present
with
respect
to
each
of
these.
exactly
the
same
amount
of
evidence
that
a
will
kill
a
witness
and
b
will
kill
someone
not
connected
with
the
judicial
system.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
could
go
to
a
witness
and
say,
lay
low.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cardinale.
general
fried,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
the
case
is
submitted.
