justice
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
think
that
the
promptness
of
the
trial
has
anything
to
do
with
the
propriety
of
seeking
pretrial
detention?
in
other
words,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
government
would
be
ready
to
go
to
trial
right
away
on
the
one
hand,
or
recognize
that
there's
congestion
on
the
calendar
and
all
sorts
of
things
that
might
require
prolonged
delay?
is
that
a
relevant
factor
to
consider?
justice
stevens
mr.
cardinale,
is
it
any
different,
in
punishment
terms,
from
the
examples
that
you
say
are
permissible?
say
there
was
proof
that
the
defendant
had
threatened
the
life
of,
or
was
about
to
try
and
kill
a
witness?
would
that
not
also
be
punishment?
justice
stevens
mr.
cardinale,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
an
earlier
colloquy
you
had
with
justice
scalia.
did
you
agree
that
it
is
constitutional
for
a
defendant
in
a
capital
case
to
be
denied
bail?
justice
stevens
you
say
that's
based
on
a
presumption
that
in
view
of
the
severity
of
the
sentence,
there
is
a
probability
that
there
will
be
flight?
justice
stevens
would
this
statute
have
been
constitutional
if
they
had,
with
respect
to
the
crimes
for
which
these
people
were
charged,
congress
had
authorized
the
death
penalty?
would
that
make
the
pretrial
detention
in
this
very
case
permissible?
