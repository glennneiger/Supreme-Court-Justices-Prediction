justice
scalia
but
in
fact,
general
fried,
to
go
back
to
your
terrorist
example,
had
the
same
situation,
except
he
isn't
arrested
for
a
past
offense
yet;
he
has
just
gone
around
saying,
i
am
going
to
blow
up
an
airline.
now,
you
acknowledge
that
in
that
situation,
this
legislation
would
not
apply.
there
would
be
no
way
to
detain
the
individual
unless
and
until
he
commits
an
offense
for
which
he's
arrested.
that's
what
causes...
that's
what
produces
the
argument
that
there
has
to
be
some
punitive
element
to
this
detention.
justice
scalia
general
fried,
before
you
get
off
this,
this
really
doesn't...
i
suppose
it
doesn't
relate
to
the
eighth
amendment;
it
could,
but
would
you
say
that
you
could...
that
a
state
could
simply
say,
henceforth,
there
will
be
no
bail
for
all
felonies?
justice
scalia
what
would
that
violate?
justice
scalia
that
is,
because
that
system
would
pick
up
nondangerous
accused
felons
as
well
as
dangerous
accused
felons;
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
but
that
depends
on
how
good
your
predictive
factors
are.
once
you
say
that
you
can't
do
it
for
no
reason
at
all,
and
just
say
generally
nobody
gets
bail,
then
you
say
the
only
reason
you
can
deny
it
is
because
there
is
a
real
danger.
so
you
really
are
stuck
with
defending
the
rough
validity
of
the
predictive
factor.
justice
scalia
mr.
cardinale,
if
you're
going
to
make
an
eighth
amendment
argument,
then...
and
i
gather
you
say
the
eighth
amendment
is
available
to
you?
justice
scalia
well,
how
can
you
read
the
eighth
amendment
to
prohibit
the
denial
of
bail?
because
it
does
not
have
an
exception
for
capital
crimes.
it
says,
excessive
bail
shall
not
be
required.
now,
if
you
read
that
as
meaning,
there
must
always
be
bail,
then
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
render
capital
cases
non-bailable,
which
i
assume
you
don't
assert
that
that's
the
case.
justice
scalia
then
you
must
be
appealing
to
some
principle
other
than
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
scalia
and
in
most
cases,
you
can
require
excessive
bail
instead
of
simply
deny
bail?
doesn't
sound
like
a
drafting
error.
justice
scalia
could
have
been
meant
to
be
a
protection
against
the
judges.
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
judges
were
not
particularly
smiled
upon
by
the
framers.
and
it
could
have
been,
as
many
think
it
is,
that
the
king's
judges
had
been
imposing
excessive
bails
for
those
crimes
that
were
bailable.
and
the
eighth
amendment
is
easily
explicable
as
something
directed
against
judges
rather
than
legislatures.
justice
scalia
it
isn't
usually
the
legislature
that
makes
the
bail
excessive.
the
language,
excessive
bail
shall
not
be
required;
the
legislature...
i
don't
know
of
any
legislative
statutes
that
sets
the
amount
of
bail.
to
prohibit
excessive
bail
is
to
prohibit
something
that's
done
by
judges,
not
by
legislators.
justice
scalia
mr.
cardinale,
isn't
it
possible
that
the
reason
for
the
difference
in
the
two
cases,
one
person
who's
going
to
kill
a
witness
and
one
not,
the
reason
for
the
differing
treatment
is
not
any
inherent
greater
sanctity
for
the
judicial
process,
but
just
simply
because
as
common
law
courts,
courts
had
the
power
and
the
authority
to
protect
their
own
processes?
they
weren't
given
any
right
to
protect
the
society
at
large.
justice
scalia
but
now
there
is
a
statute
from
the
body
which
does
have
the
authority
to
protect
the
society
at
large,
the
congress,
which
says,
do
the
same
thing
for
the
society
at
large
that
you've
been
doing
under
your
inherent
judicial
authority
to
protect
your
own
processes.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
one
way
to
explain
how
come
we've
done
this
in
the
past
but
haven't
done
the
other
in
the
past?
justice
scalia
don't
we
just
look
at
what
happened
to
these
people?
justice
scalia
i
thought
we
only
did
that
for
the
first
amendment.
you
mean,
even
though
you
weren't
subjected
to
the
presumptions,
for
example,
you
can
complain
about
the
existence
of
those
presumptions?
