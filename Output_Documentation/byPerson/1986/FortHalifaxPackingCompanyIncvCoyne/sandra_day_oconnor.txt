justice
o'connor
--but
here
of
course,
the
employer
did
have
some
sort
of
erisa
plan
in
effect.
justice
o'connor
tell
me
what
it
takes
to
maintain
the
plan
other
than
writing
checks?
do
you
have
to
fund
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
warren,
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
has
also
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
suggesting
that
this
court's
opinion
in
shaw
v.
delta
airlines
indicates
that
the
erisa
preemption
provisions
also
prohibit
and
preempt
state
laws
which
simply
require
employers
to
provide
certain
specific
benefits
to
employees.
justice
o'connor
regardless
of
the
question
of
whether
it
requires,
whether
maine's
law
requires
you
to
set
up
a
plan,
or
not.
justice
o'connor
right.
he
would
go
far
beyond
this
discussion
of
whether
maine
law
requires
a
plan
and
say
that
what
this
court
said
in
shaw
means
that
a
state
can't
tell
employers
what
fringe
benefits
to
provide.
justice
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
accurate
because
apparently
the
solicitor
general's
speaking
for
the
secretary
would
say
that
states
cannot
direct
specific
benefits
to
be
provided
if
they
are
the
type
of
benefits
covered
by
erisa.
justice
o'connor
one
of
the
things
that
the
solicitor
general
relies
upon
is
the
fact
that
in
erisa
and
in
the
preemption
section,
congress
specifically
carved
out
hawaii's
law
which
provided
for
a
specific
kind
of
health
benefit.
justice
o'connor
and
opted
not
to
protect
any
other
type
of
state
law.
that
might
indeed
be
an
indicator
that
congress
was
trying
to
be
very
specific
about
what
states
could
do
or
not
do,
and
intended
to
preclude
a
law
like
maine's.
justice
o'connor
and
that
is
one
shot.
well,
death
benefits
are
a
one
time
benefit.
and
yet
surely
you
wouldn't
argue
that
erisa
doesn't
reach
those.
