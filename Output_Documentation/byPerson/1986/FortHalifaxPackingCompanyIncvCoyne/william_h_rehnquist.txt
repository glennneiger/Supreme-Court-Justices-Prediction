chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
yavis.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
suppose
you
get
severance
pay
even
though
you
go
right
to
another
job
too,
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
yavis.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
warren.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
take
it
a
state
could
not,
a
state
like
maine,
can't
say
to
employers
within
the
state,
we
want
you
all
to
set
up
erisa
plans
that
meet
this
minimum
standard.
then,
of
course,
they
will
all
be
governed
by
erisa.
a
state
can't
say
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
plan
as
defined
in
erisa?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
in
the
statutory
context
you
have
both
employee
welfare
benefit
plan
and
employee
pension
benefit
plan,
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
warren,
you
have
fairly
complicated
definitions
of
plan
and
do
you
think
it
really
lends
itself
to
these
kind
of
generalizations
that
this
was
what
congress
was
getting
at
or
wasn't
getting
at
rather
than
kind
of
a
parsing
of
the
section?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
term
employee
welfare
benefit
plan
and
the
term
employee
pension
benefit
plans
are
both
defined.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
warren.
mr.
yavis,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
doesn't
that
mean
that
the
employee
contributes
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
yavis.
the
case
is
submitted.
