justice
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
you,
mr.
yavis
for
a
second.
the
definition
in
the
erisa
is
it's
a
plan
that's
heretofore
or
hereafter
established
or
maintained
by
an
employer.
and
you
contend
that
when
the
statute
was
passed,
well
how
does
that
language
fit
the
statute?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
this
language
in
erisa
covers
that
plan
established
or
maintained
by
the
state
of
maine.
justice
stevens
say
for,
take
for
the
example,
say
you
didn't
have
a
plan
at
all.
you're
an
employer
that
just
didn't
provide
for
severance
or
benefits
or
anything,
but
you
would
have
to
comply
with
the
statute.
would
your
compliance
with
the
statute
in
your
view
fall
within
this
definition
xxx.
justice
stevens
not
to
establish
it,
but
to
maintain
it.
justice
stevens
and
you
say
the
act
of
the
writing
the
checks
is
enough
to
be
maintaining
a
plan?
justice
stevens
if
you
know
who
the
employees
are
when
you
fire
them,
i'm
sure.
justice
stevens
but
that's
not
a
plan
that
the
employer,
that's
all
a
matter
of
statutory
compliance
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
you
say
that,
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is
compliance
with
the
statute
is
equivalent
to
maintaining
a
plan.
justice
stevens
well
if
you
had
it
voluntarily--
justice
stevens
--there's
no
problem.
this
is
not
something
that
you
voluntarily
do.
you've
got
to
be
hypothetical--
justice
stevens
--if
you
had
said--
justice
stevens
but
if
it
were
held,
and
i
am
not
saying
it
should
be,
but
if
it
were
held
that
there
is
no
preemption
here
then
those
duties
wouldn't
apply
to
compliance
with
the
maine
statute.
all
you
would
have
to
do
with
regard
to
severance
pay
is
do
what
the
statute
requires
if
it
were
held
that
there
was
no
preemption.
justice
stevens
you
wouldn't
have
to
give
notice
or
any
of
that.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
if
i
may?
supposing
maine
amended
its
statute
and
now
it
has
an
exception
from
the
requirement
if
you
adopt
a,
have
a
severance
provision
in
a
plan
you
don't
have
to
comply
with
the
maine
statute
and
i
guess
it's
pretty
hard
to
get
that
if
the
union
knows
they
can
get
the
statutory
business.
suppose
instead
of
that
they
passed
an
amendment
said
the
severance
obligation
shall
not
apply
to
any
employer
who
has
an
erisa
plan
of
any
kind
so
that
the
whole
scope
of
the
statutory
operation
was
in,
for
employers
who
had
no
plans
other
than
this,
would
it
still
be
preempted
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
you
would
draw
a
distinction,
as
i
take
it,
to
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
the
maine
statute
said
you
must
create
a
fund
and
pay
benefits
out
of
that
in
certain
periodic
payments.
you
would
agree
that
would
be
a
plan
created
by
the
employer
in
compliance
with
the
statue
and
therefore
be
an
erisa
plan.
justice
stevens
so
they
couldn't.
justice
stevens
but
your
point
is
that--
justice
stevens
--this
statute
doesn't
require
them
to
establish
or
maintain
any
plan.
