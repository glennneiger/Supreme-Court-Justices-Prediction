justice
white
so
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
the
state
just
said,
we're
not
going
to
say
anything
about
what
should
be
in
a
plan,
but
you
have
to
have
a
severance
plan.
justice
white
do
you
conclude
that
from
the
preemption
clause?
is
that
what
you
conclude
from?
justice
white
well
would
you
be
arguing
the
same
if
the
expressed
preemption
clause
wasn't
even
in
erisa?
justice
white
well
couldn't
you
say
in
this
case
that
the
maine
law
is
not
preempted
in
the
sense
that
it
may
require
the
employer
to
have
a
severance
pay
policy
but
that
once
he
establishes
it,
it's
subject
to
erisa?
justice
white
well
i
know.
i
know,
but
if
you
did
establish
a
severance
pay
plan
as
the
statute
purports
to
require
it
would
be
subject
to
erisa
then
wouldn't
it?
because
then
you
have
a
plan?
justice
white
and,
erisa,
maine
doesn't
say
that
it
wouldn't,
does
it?
it
wouldn't
interfere.
it
doesn't
purport
to
interfere
with
erisa
coverage
once
the
plan
is
adopted.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
i
understand
your
position
is
that
maine
does
require
the
type
of
a
plan
that
erisa
would
reach?
justice
white
and
if
an
employer
on
his
own
established
precisely
the
kind
of
plan
that
the
maine
law
requires
you
say
that
would
not
be
covered
by
erisa?
justice
white
say
the
union
and
the
employer
negotiated
and
said
anytime
somebody
leaves
he
gets
a
week's
pay
period.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that,
let's
assume
in
some
other
state--
justice
white
--a
union
and
an
employer
negotiates
a
severance
pay
plan
and
it's
identical
with
what
the
maine
law
requires.
justice
white
well,
i'm
just
saying
if
the
plan
requires
precisely
what,
sets
up
exactly
what
the
maine
law
requires.
justice
white
uh-huh.
justice
white
erisa,
yes.
but
you
say
the
maine,
an
employer
who
establishes
a
plan
in
response
to
the
maine
statute
is
not
establishing
a
plan
that
is
subject
to
erisa.
is
that
right?
justice
white
well
that's
what
you
said
a
while
ago.
justice
white
well
that
may
be
so.
but
now
here
is
an
employer
who
established
it
because
of
the
maine
law.
justice
white
well,
so
that
isn't
a
plan
at
all
if
he
just
recognizes
his
obligation
under
the
law
to
make
a
payment.
justice
white
well,
say
if
the
employer
did
set
up
a
plan
in
response
to
this
statute,
but
he
established
it
and
he
wrote
out
a
plan
and
arranged
for
funding
you
would
think
that
wouldn't
be
an
erisa
plan.
justice
white
it
would
be
reached
by
erisa.
justice
white
well
i
don't
understand
why
maine
is
so
insistent
on
saying
that
an
employer's
response
to
this
statute,
his
obedience
to
the
statute
does
not
create
an
erisa
covered
plan.
justice
white
because
i
don't
know.
is
it
necessarily
inconsistent
to
say
that
maine's
requirement
that
he
establish
a
plan
is
not
preempted,
but
that
the
plan
he
sets
up
is
an
erisa
plan.
justice
white
but
here's
an
employer
who
doesn't
have
a
plan,
he
doesn't
want
one,
but
the
law
requires
him
to
pay
severance
pay.
this
maine
statute
requires
him
to
pay,
to
give
his
employees
severance
pay.
justice
white
and
he
thoroughly
intends
to
obey
the
law,
and
he
does.
now
why
do
you
insist
that
that
isn't,
doesn't
establish
an
erisa
plan.
justice
white
well,
the
union
says
to
him,
do
you
intend
to
live
up
to
this
maine
statute.
of
course
i
do.
and
that's
all
that's
said
and
he
does.
he
just
pays
severance
pay
in
accordance--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
well
why
is
that
important
to
you?
what
is
it
were
an
erisa
plan?
justice
white
so
then
maine
could
no
longer
then
require
them
to
maintain
the
plan.
justice
white
why
does
that
definition
reach
severance
plans
at
all?
justice
white
186(c).
justice
white
so
you
don't
dispute
that
erisa
does
reach
severance
arrangements.
justice
white
i
see.
