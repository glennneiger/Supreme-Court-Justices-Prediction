justice
scalia
mr.
yavis,
is
the
employer's
compliance
with
that
statute
subject
to
erisa?
do
erisa
regulations
govern
anything
that
occurs
in
order
to
comply
with
that
statute.
justice
scalia
make
believe
it
doesn't.
would,
in
implementing
that
statute,
the
employer
have
to
comply
with
erisa
regs?
justice
scalia
but
does
erisa
call
for
it?
justice
scalia
if
it's
not
preempted
by
erisa,--
justice
scalia
--would
there
have
to
be
compliance
with
any
erisa
regulations?
justice
scalia
which
means
what?
what
would
erisa
require
to
be
done
with
respect
to
this
plan?
justice
scalia
i
assume
it's
also
true
that
if
there
were
no
state
statute,
but
if
a
private
employer
had
a
plan,
a
severance
pay
plan
precisely
the
same
as
what
the
statute
requires
that
private
employer
would
also
be
covered
by
erisa.
justice
scalia
xxx
to
that
plan.
justice
scalia
erisa
doesn't
require
that
either?
justice
scalia
so
even
if
a
private
employer
set
up
the
same
kind
of
a
plan
under
his
own
authority
without
a
statute
compelling
it,
he
would
be
doing
no
more
than
what
your
client
does
writing
a
check.
justice
scalia
does
the
maine
statute
require
you
to
do
that
publication?
justice
scalia
it
does
not?
justice
scalia
to
do
the
same
kind
of
publication
and
notification
that
erisa
does.
justice
scalia
so
unless
your
plan
is
covered
by
erisa
those
duties
of
the
employer
would
be
eliminated.
justice
scalia
what
is
514(c)(2)?
justice
scalia
you
have
them
published
in
your
appendix
with
the
29
u.s.c.
numbers.
why
don't
you--
justice
scalia
why?
you
said
that
if
there
was
a
private
plan
that
required
severance
payments
only
upon
removal
of
the
plant,
it
would
be
covered.
justice
scalia
okay.
so
now
you're
telling
us
that
maine
can,
or
any
state
i
presume,
can
take
its
employers
out
of
the
coverage
of
erisa,
by
simply
mandating
by
law
what
erisa
would
cover
had
the
employers
done
it
voluntarily.
that's
a
great
out
for
a
lot
of
employers.
just
get
the
states
to
enact
a
law
that
covers
the
kind
of
plan
they
want
to
adopt
and
that
plan
is
out
of
erisa.
justice
scalia
oh.
justice
scalia
well
that's
nice.
justice
scalia
i
don't
care
what
they
were
focusing
on,
i
care
about
the
law
they
wrote.
now
why
is
there
anything
in
the
law
that
would
allow
me
to
make
this
kind
of
distinction.
justice
scalia
what
word
would
enable
this
distinction
that
you
can
yank
a,
what
would
otherwise
be
a
covered
severance
plan
out
of
erisa
simply
by
adopting
a
state
statute
that
covers
it
but
you
can't
yank
anything
else
out
of
erisa
by
adopting
a
state
statute
that
covers
it?
justice
scalia
as
much
of
a
plan
as
a
severance
plan
ever
is.
a
severance
plan
never
requires
funding
as
i
understand
it.
justice
scalia
oh,
okay.
well
that
would
make
a
big
difference.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
it
would
have
to
be
funded?
justice
scalia
well
the
big
difference,
if
i
understand
is,
under
your
position
the
employer
then
would
have
made
a
promise
to
pay
some
benefits
on
a
certain
contingency
arising.
justice
scalia
and
there's
no
such
promise
here.
justice
scalia
it's
important
to
me,
this
is
going
back
over
earlier
ground
whether
a
plan
adopted
by
the
employer
under
the
statute
is
the
same
as
a
plan
that
he
might
adopt
under
erisa.
that
is,
you
assert
that
if
adopted
under
erisa
it
would
have
to
be
funded?
is
that
so
despite
the
fact
that
section
1002(2)(b)
says
that
the
secretary
may
proscribe
rules
under
which
severance
pay
arrangements
shall,
for
purposes
of
this
chapter
be
treated
as
welfare
plans
rather
than
pension
plans.
does
that
make
any
difference
in--
justice
scalia
--do
welfare
plans
have
to
be
funded?
justice
scalia
i'm
sure
of
that.
but
what
i'm
worried
about
at
least,
is
that
i'm
sure
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
enable
one
of
those
private
plans
that
is,
the
same
kind
as
if
it
had
been
adopted
in
negotiations
with
a
union
to
be
yanked
out
of
erisa
simply
by
having
it
required
by
state
law.
and
so,
if
this
severance
plan
is
in
fact
no
different
from
what
the
employer
would
be
doing
under
erisa,
i'd
be
very
reluctant
to
find
that
the
state
can
in
effect,
yank
it
out
of
erisa
by
mandating
it.
justice
scalia
it
is
not
the
mandating
of
it
by
the
state
alone
that
can
possibly
take
it
out
of
erisa
right
here.
justice
scalia
xxx
even
though
other
pension
plans,
or
even
though
other
severance
plans
are
subject
to
erisa,
this
one
is
not
subject
to
erisa.
that
the
employer
has
no
erisa
obligation
with
regard
to
this.
justice
scalia
do
we
know
what
position
the
secretary
takes
on
this?
justice
scalia
or,
put
it
put
differently.
the
position
he
takes
is
that
the
plan
required
to
be
established
by
the
maine
law
is
an
erisa
plan.
justice
scalia
not
a
severance
plan
under
erisa.
i
mean,
every
severance
plan
that
i'm
familiar
with,
it's
a
one
shot
severance
plan.
that's
the
normal
one.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well
the
same
with
the
statute.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
you're
talking
about
a
plant
closing.
justice
scalia
say
that
again.
you
lost
me.
justice
scalia
beginning
with
the,
if.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
why
would
that
be
any
stranger
than
any
other
state
law
that
proscribes
or
specifies,
let's
say
a
standard
retirement
plan?
a
state
enacts
a
law
that
requires
a
specific
retirement
plan.
will
you
come
before
us
and
say,
well
it
can't
possibly
be
preempted
in
the
case
where
the
employer
has
no
retirement
plan
of
his
own
anyway.
justice
scalia
no
separate
entity
either
as
mr.
warren
referred
to
xxx.
