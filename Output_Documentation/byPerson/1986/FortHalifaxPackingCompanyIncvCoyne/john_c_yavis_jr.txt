mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
for
decision
the
conflict
between
erisa
and
a
maine
statute
upheld
by
the
maine
supreme
judicial
court.
erisa
makes
employee
benefit
plans
a
subject
of
exclusive
federal
concern.
and
expressly
preempts
any
and
all
state
laws
that
relate
to
such
plans.
while
the
maine
statute
requires
payment
of
severance
pay
benefits
included
within
erisa
coverage.
in
summary,
our
position
is,
first,
that
erisa
section
514
preempts
state
mandated
or
state
created
plans.
and
second,
that
the
section
4(b)(3)
exemption
does
not
extend
to
the
maine
severance
pay
law.
we
submit
that
maine
may
not
impose
a
severance
pay
plan
any
more
than
it
might
impose
a
pension
plan.
briefly
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
fort
halifax
is
part
of
a
larger
group
of
companies
headed
by
corbett
enterprises,
inc.
which
in
1981
had
operations
in
approximately
11
states.
these
were
poultry
operations
and
fort
halifax
operated
its
plant
in
maine
from
1972
until
may
of
1981
when
the
plant
closed
because
of
adverse
market
conditions.
fort
halifax
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
force
at
the
time
of
the
plant
closing
and
pursuant
to
that
plan
it
had
provided
a
retirement
plan
to
its
production
workers
and
various
employee
welfare
benefit
plans
including
life
insurance,
combination
life
and
health,
major
medical
and
accident
and
sickness
as
well
as
other
employee
benefits.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
however
did
not
call
however,
for
the
payment
of
severance
pay.
and
in
this
action,
the
maine
department
of
labor,
sought
to
enforce
that
maine
severance
pay
statute
which
covers
establishments
with
basically
100
or
more
employees
that
relocate
or
close,
that
is
the
establishment
relocates
or
closes,
the
statute
requires
payment
of
severance
pay
to
eligible
employees.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
the
erisa
regulations
would
apply
because
erisa
in
our
opinion
would
preempt
the
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
the
statute
does
not
call
for
that.
the
maine
statute
does
not
call
for
that.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
erisa
does--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--yes,
erisa
then--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--erisa
does
cover
severance
pay
plans
expressly
and
that's
in
3(1)(a)
where
some
courts
have
held
that
erisa
covers
severance
benefits
as
benefits
as
benefits
in
the
event
of
unemployment.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
there
would
be,
for
example,
disclosure
to
employees,
reporting,
there
would
be
fiduciary
standards,
there
would
be
access
to
federal
courts,
there
would
be
potential
intrusion
by
the
federal
department
of
labor.
various
protective
measures
to
assure
that
the
benefits
were
received.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
i
should
add,
your
honor,
that
there
are
alternative
grounds
in
the
statute
for
including
severance
pay
as
an
erisa
benefit.
in
3(1)(b)
there's
a
severance
pay
specific
reference
to
severance
benefits
and
in
3(2)(b)
which
was
adopted
by
congress
in
1980
there's
a
reference
to
severance
pay
arrangements
and
congress
gave
authority
to
the
department
of
labor,
to
the
secretary
to
define
severance
pay
arrangements
as
welfare
benefit
plans
instead
of
what
might
have
been
the
case
to
have
them
treated
as
pension
plans.
the
department
of
labor
regulations
do
define
severance
benefits
as
welfare
plans
and
therefore
for
purposes
of
erisa,
they
are
employee
benefit
plans.
the
maine
statute
presents
an
employer
with
a
choice.
either
have
a
private
contract
granting,
providing
is
the
statutory
word,
providing
severance
pay,
or
pay
severance
pay
according
to
the
statute.
the
statute
defines
eligibility,
the
type
of
benefit
that
will
be
provided,
who
may
obtain
that
benefit
and
when,
and
what
procedure
one
will
follow
to
collect
it.
the
eligibility
is
basically
three
years
or
more
of
employment.
the
type
of
benefit
is
defined
as
severance
pay.
the
amount
is
one
weeks
pay
for
each
year
of
employment
at
the
establishment,
and
in
this
case
that
meant
that
the
judgment
below
covered
periods
before
the
date
of
acquisition
of
the
plant
by
fort
halifax.
the
statute
covers
when
payments
are
due
and
it
provides
a
procedure
for
collecting
benefits
and
strangely
provides
for
suit
in
state
or
federal
court.
the
statute
has
within
itself,
in
other
words
all
the
indicia
of
a
plan.
the
term
plan
itself
is
not
defined
as
such
in
erisa.
is
it
referred
to
as
a
plan
fund
or
program
but
there's
otherwise
no
formal
requirement
for
what
must
constitute
a
plan.
on
its
face
therefore,
the
maine
plan,
the
main
law
purports
to
regulate
a
defined
erisa
benefit
plan,
that
is
severance
pay.
and
erisa
section
514
then
preempts
that
law
to
the
extent
the
law
relates
to
any
employee
benefit
plan.
now
the
relationship
here
we
contend
is
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
well
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
plan
has
been
initiated
by
the
statutory
action
of
the
state
of
maine.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
if
the
plan
were
solely
established
by
the
state
of
maine
and
not
maintained
by
the
employer
then
perhaps
the
answer
would
be
no.
but
we
do
maintain
that
the--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--yes,
it
would
because
we
would
be
required
to
maintain
that
plan.
the
company
would
be
the
one
that
would
have
to
pay
the
benefits.
the
company
would
be
the
one
that
would
have
to
administer
the
benefits.
to
find
the
people
to
write
the
checks
and
so
forth;
to
perhaps
defend
claims
if
any
were
raised.
so,
our
position
is
yes,
it
is
the
employer
that
is
required
to
maintain
the
plan--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
yes,
and--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--but
there
may
or
may
not
be
eligibility.
for
example,
if
someone
at
a
covered
established
is
someone
employed
for
three
years
or
not,
are
there
breaks
in
service
and
so
forth.
so,--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--well
those
are,
what
we
say
is
that
the
statute
in
effect
presents
the
plan
to
the
employer,
that
the
employer
must
thereby
maintain
that
plan.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
in
this
case
it
would,
if
we
had
the
same
plan
apart
from
the
statute
that
would
be
the
maintenance
of
the
plan.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
we
are
compelled
to
do
it
by
the
force
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
yes
it
did.
yes,
it
had
the
retirement
plan
for
production
workers.
it
had
a
retirement
plan
for
administrative
and
clerical
personnel.
and
it
had
the
four
employee
welfare
benefit
plans
that
i
mentioned.
i'll
take
this
opportunity
to
say
that
in
the
state
of
maine's
brief
they
say
to
the
contrary
that
we
had
no
other
plans
besides
the
retirement
plans.
that
is
not
correct.
these
other
plans
i
referred
to
in
the
joint
appendix
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
pages
27
to
129.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
no
you
do
not,
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
a
severance
pay
plan
you
do
not.
and--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--it
does
not.
it
does
not
require
a
trust.
as
long
as
the
payment
is
going
to
be
made
out
reasonably
currently
after
the
severance.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
right,
your
honor,
a
person
subject
to
such
a
plan
should
go
through
the
publication
and
disclosure
aspects,
but
up
to
the
time
of
payment
there
is
no
requirement
for
funding,
no
requirement
for
a
trust.
the
erisa
and
the
regulations
do
not
require
that
in
the
case
of
the
severance
pay
category
of
plan.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
does
it
require
you
to
do
what?
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
those
are,
of
course,
the
duties
considered
important
by
erisa.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
i
suppose
that's
right.
if
erisa
doesn't
apply
at
all.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
the
structure
of
erisa
supports
the
congressional
intent
to
have
broad
preemption
of
any
and
all
state
laws.
that
is
the
phrase,
any
and
all
in
section
514
(a)
and
the
relationship
here
is
that
one
either
has
to
have
the
statutory
plan
or
the
private
contract
providing
for
severance
pay.
i'd
like
to
point
out
other
aspects
of
the
structure
of
erisa
that
bear
on
that
congressional
intent.
the
definition
of
the
term,
state,
in
section
3(10),
ten
in
parenthesis,
applies
to
the
overall
statute
and
basically
says
a
state
is
a
state.
but
in
section
514
there
is
a
second
definition
of
state
in
514(c)(2).
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
your
honor,
514(c)(2)
is
at
page
66
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix.
and
the
definition
of
state
for
the
purposes
of
preemption
is
now
refined,
expanded,
clarified
in
a
very
significant
way.
the
term
state
now
includes
a
state
which
purports
to
regulate
directly
or
indirectly
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employee
benefit
plans
covered
by
this
subchapter.
and
as
i've
indicated
a
severance
pay
plan
is
one
such
plan.
state
law
on
the
same
page,
the
preceding
subsection
1,
is
also
broadly
defined,
again
to
indicate
congress'
intent
to
broadly
preempt
any
and
all
state
laws,
and
it's
defined
to
include
other
state
action.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
yes.
our
position
is
that
the
states
may
not
mandate
the
award
of
employee
benefit
plans
or
particular
levels
or
types
of
benefits.
that's
a
decision
left
to
the
private
parties.
that's
part
of
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
the
erisa
statute.
the
policy
statement
in
section
2
of
the
act
refers
to
the
scope
and
impact
increasingly
interstate.
there's
a
phrase
about
effected
with
national
public
interest;
another
reference
to
interstate
character
and
so
forth.
there
is
a
policy
statement
that
conveys
congress'
desire
to
have
a
broad
federal
regulation.
and
section
4(b)(3)
is
also
another
indication
of
the
congressional
intent
that
is
at
page
63
of
our
joint
appendix
for
the
jurisdictional
statement.
and
shows
congress'
comprehension
that
there
would
be
state
mandated
employee
benefit
plans
of
which
three
are
excluded
from
coverage,
and
only
three.
otherwise,
congress
contemplated
that
state
attempts
to
mandate
erisa
benefit
plans
would
be
within
erisa's
coverage
and
subject
to
preemption.
now
there
have
been
subsequent
proposed
amendments
to
4(b)(3).
none
have
been
adopted.
there
was
an
amendment
in
1983
that
followed
this
court's
decision,
this
court's
affirmance
in
agsalud,
but
the
decision
was
left
in
tact.
basically,
the
statute
was
amended
in
minor
ways
to
accommodate
the
hawaiian
statute
in
part,
not
in
total.
and
the
basic
preemptive
scope
of
514
was
left
in
place
following
those
amendments.
those
amendments
then
themselves
show
congress'
desire
to
have
a
broad
preemptive
scope,
broad
preemption
of
any
and
all
state
laws.
now
in
this
court,
maine
is
trying
to
redefine
what
its
statute
means
in
order
to
avoid
514(c)(2).
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
i
believe
so.
and
i
believe
that
that's
the
congressional
intention
to
leave
the
type
of
benefits,
the
level
of
benefits
to
the
parties
choice
basically.
congress
left
that
decision
to
the
private
parties.
now,
maine
here--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--in
part.
in
part,
your
honor.
in
part.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
well
i
would
think
that
would
be
a,
certainly
a
more
difficult
case
but
the
intent
of
the
statute
expressed
in
the
policy
in
section
2
and
if
the
same
legislative
history
were
there
it
would
be
hard
to
conceive
the
same
legislative
history
without
the
expressed
preemption
provision.
but
certainly,
hypothetically
yes.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
decision
was
left
to
the
states.
that--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--i
believe
that
if
we
accepted
that
plan,
yes,
it
would
be
a
severance
pay
plan
under
3(1)(a)
or
3(1)(b)--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--well
conceivably--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
if
that's
right.
conceivably
the
remedies
afforded
in
the
state
statute
could
depart
from
remedies
in
the
federal
statute.
for
example,
maine
certainly
isn't
giving
anyone
any
right
to
the
secretary
of
labor
to
come
in
and
advance
the
cause
of
participants.
maine
just
is
not
doing
that.
what
maine
is
trying
to
do
in
this
court
is
to
tell
the
court
that
the
benefit
could
have
been
negotiated
away
completely.
they
argue
at
pages
17
and
18,
that
the
maine
statute
really
doesn't
mandate
any
benefits
at
all
and
therefore
514(c)(2)
wouldn't
come
into
play
if
the
statute
doesn't
purport
to
regulate
employee
benefit
plans.
well
the
express
wording
of
the--
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
--514(c)(2)?
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
that
is
at
page
65.
excuse
me,
at
page
66.
and
it's
under
(c)
definitions,
subparagraph
(2).
i
simply
want
to
indicate
here
that
maine
is
trying
to
take
a
different
tack
than
what
the
express
words
of
the
statute
say.
the
express
words
of
the
statute
say
you
have
to
have
either
an
express
contract
providing
for
severance
pay,
or
you
observe
the
statute.
that's
the
applicable
exception
of
the
statute
that
i'm
referring
to.
an
express
contract
providing
severance
pay.
here
they
argue
that
an
employer
could
have
an
express
contract
eliminating
severance
pay.
that
was
not
the
finding
of
the
maine
supreme
court.
and
i
refer
you
to
our
joint
appendix
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
a-12
for
the
words
that
the
maine
supreme
court
used
in
that
regard.
in
other
words,
under
the
statute
you
either
have
to
have
an
express
contract
or
face
liability
under
the
statute.
i
very
briefly
want
to
turn
to
the
4(b)(3)
issue
which
is,
the
claim
is
made
that
4(b)(3)
exempts
the
maine
severance
pay
law
as
an
unemployment
compensation
law.
4(b)(3)
exempts
plans
for
compliance
with
three
types
of
laws:
workman's
compensation,
unemployment
compensation
and
disability
insurance
laws.
severance
pay
is
not
expressly
one
of
those
three
categories.
the
attempt
is
made
here
to
fit
severance
pay
within
the
unemployment
compensation
law
category.
otherwise
maine
would
be
trying
to
add
a
fourth
category
to
that
statute.
we
have
five
responses
to
that.
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
term,
unemployment
compensation
law
is
otherwise.
that
congress'
use
of
different
terms
in
the
statute
at
different
places
entitles
the
statute
to
the
normal
presumption
that
different
things
were
meant
when
different
words
were
used.
the
department's
regulations
do
not
treat
severance
pay
as
unemployment
compensation.
fourthly,
maine
itself
does
not
treat
severance
pay
as
unemployment
compensation
and
fifth,
the
maine
law's
real
thrust
is
not
at
unemployment.
our
fundamental
position
is
that
the
term
unemployment
compensation
law
had
in
1974,
and
has
today,
an
accepted
meaning.
that
is
a
meaning
that
is
pursuant
to
the
social
security
act
and
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
50
states
have
such
laws.
it
is
a
strange
reading
to
look
for
some
other
interpretation
of
that
term.
in
the
statute
itself
i've
already
referred
to
3(1)(a),
3(1)(b)
and
3(2)(b).
congress
itself
is
using
the
words
severance
pay
and
severance
pay
arrangements
where
at
another
place
in
the
statute
it's
using
the
term
benefits
in
the
event
of
unemployment
and
at
still
another
place
using
the
term
unemployment
compensation
law.
congress
used
those
terms
presumably
for
the
different
meanings
that
each
had.
unemployment
compensation
means
something
quite
different
than
severance
pay.
severance
pay
doesn't
connote
necessarily
unemployment,
although
there
will
be
a
termination
of
employment.
the
regulations
of
the
department
cite
in
our
reply
brief
also
do
not
equate
severance
pay
and
unemployment
compensation.
those
regulations
have
been
in
place,
i
believe,
since
1975.
there's
been
a
1980
amendment
to
the
statute
authorizing
the
secretary's
regulations.
those
regulations
have
the
force
of
law
and
are
entitled
to
great
weight.
now
fourthly,
i
said
maine
itself
doesn't
consider
it's
severance
pay
law
to
be
an
unemployment
compensation
law.
it
considers
severance
pay
to
be
wages,
that's
the
way
that
severance
pay
is,
that's
the
way
the
unemployment
compensation
law
defines
severance
pay.
the
severance
pay
statute
is
not
in
the
unemployment
compensation
statute.
it's
somewhere
else
in
the
maine
statutes
under
a
heading
severance
pay,
in
a
subchapter
that
starts
out,
with
wages.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
that's
right.
there's
no
connection
necessarily
to
unemployment
at
all.
our
fifth
response
is
that
real
trust
is
not
unemployment
at
all.
and
the
point
that
you've
just
made,
your
honor,
is
just
that.
and
also,
the
exceptions
that
maine
makes
to
its
law
shows
that
its
just
concerned
with
unemployment
or
maybe
not
concerned
with
unemployment
at
all.
it
exempts
coverage
from
its
severance
pay
statute
for
a
victim
of
a
fire,
or
a
victim
of
bankruptcy.
these
people
are
just
as
injured
and
yet
they
are
not
protected.
as
the
court
stated
recently
in
guera
in
determining
whether
a
state
statute
is
preempted
our
sole
task
is
to
ascertain
the
intent
of
congress.
in
erisa
congress
has
spoken
in
express
terms
for
preemption.
unless
the
court
has
other
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
your
honor,
i'd
very
briefly
like
to
clarify
the
pension
plan
aspect
versus
the
welfare
benefit
plan
aspect
as
they
relate
to
severance
pay.
a
severance
pay
plan
under
the
statute
which
at
page
a-61
of
our
jurisdictional
statement
appendix,
1002(2)(a),
defines
the
term
pension
benefit
plan
and
pension
plan.
and
part
of
the
definition
is
that
it
will
be
a
pension
plan
where
the
plan
fund
or
program
results
in
a
deferral
of
income
by
employees
for
periods
extending
to
the
termination
of
covered
employment
or
beyond.
typically
a
severance
pay
payment
is
made
after
the
close
of,
after
the
termination
of
employment.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
no,
no.
in
the
severance
pay
case,
no.
the
statute
was
passed
in
'74.
in
'75,
regulations
were
adopted
that
despite
the
statute
defined
severance
pay
plans
as
welfare
benefit
plans.
those
statutes
remain
in
force.
in
1980,
congress
added
(3)
on
that
same
page,
a-51
to
in
effect
ratify
what
the
department
had
done
treating
severance
pay
plans
as
welfare
benefit
plans.
and
the
significance
of
that
is
that
no
funding
is
required.
one
may
pay
out
of
general
assets
and
i
refer
the
court
to
the
burlington
industry
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
briefs.
one
in
the
second
circuit,
one
in
the
fourth
circuit.
at
7721144,
the
court
refers
to
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
says
that
both
pension
benefit
plans
and
welfare
benefit
plans
must
comply
with
erisa's
reporting
and
disclosure
requirements
and
it's
fiduciary
standards.
but
only
the
pension
plans
are
subject
to
the
more
stringent
requirements
of
vesting
and
funding.
and
that's
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
that
the
department
has
adopted
treating
the
severance
pay
plan
not
as
a
pension
plan,
but
as
a
welfare
benefit
plan.
although
there
may
be
circumstances
where
even
a
severance
pay
plan
can
become
a
pension
plan
where
the
payment
strings
out
long
enough.
but
basically,
funding
does
not
apply
to
that.
no
separate
trust
is
required.
payments
may
be
made
in
both
these
burlington
cases
say
payments
may
be
made
out
of
general
assets.
mr.
john
c.
yavis,
jr.
no
separate
entitles
required,
your
honor.
payments
may
be
made
out
of
general
assets.
thank
you.
