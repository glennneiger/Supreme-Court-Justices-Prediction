mr.
thomas
d.
warren
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
going
to
concentrate
this
morning
as
mr.
yavis
did
on
the
erisa
preemption
argument.
there
is
another
claim
of
preemption
that
has
been
raised
by
fort
halifax.
that's
the
claim
of
preemption
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
we
believe
that
that
claim
is
adequately
treated
in
our
brief
and
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
and
i'll
content
myself
by
saying
on
that
that
we
agree
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
court's
decision
in
metropolitan
life
on
that
issue.
now
on
the
erisa
issue
we
agree
with
mr.
yavis
that
the
fundamental
question
turns
on
the
intent
of
congress
and
in
this
case
it
turns
on
the
intent
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
erisa
statute
and
in
the
express
provision
in
erisa
section
514
which
calls
for
preemption.
we
do
not
agree,
however,
that
what
the
state
is
doing
here
is
requiring
an
employer
to
maintain
an
employee
benefit
plan
within
the
meaning
of
erisa.
mr.
yavis
speaks
about
the
broadness
of
the
erisa
preemption
provision
and
i
would
just
like
to
look
directly--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
it
would
depend,
if--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--in
that
case,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
in
that
and
what
the
maine
law
requires.
that
would
provide
for
severance
pay
in
every
circumstance
of
an
employee
termination
and
what
the
maine
law
does--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--okay.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
if
it
were,
if
all
you
had
was
a
provision
in
a
contract
that
said
in
the
event
of
a
plant
closing
we
would--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--well
then
that
would
be
a
plan
which
applied
only
in
the
event
of
a
plant
closing.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
and
in
that
case,
we
think
that
it
probably
would
be
covered
by
erisa.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
well
that's
not
quite
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
i
hope
i,
what
i,
let
me
clarify.
an
employer
who
establishes
on
his
own
a
plan
or
any
kind
of
arrangement
with
his
employees
to
pay
severance
pay
either
in
the
event
of
a
plant's
closing
or
to
pay
severance
pay
generally
is,
we
believe,
exempted
from
the
maine
law
by
the
very
terms
of
the
maine
statute.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
well,
if
an
employer
creates
a
plan,
they
exempt
themselves
from
the
maine
law.
i'm
not
sure,
if
an
employer
merely
pays
what
is
required
by
the
maine
law
we
are
not
suggesting
that
that
creates
an
erisa
plan.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
well,
what
we're
really
suggesting
is
this.
the
statutory
obligation
created
by
maine
law
does
not
bear
any
resemblance
to
the
kind
of
employee
benefit
plans
which
congress
was
intending
to
regulate
under
erisa.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
i
think
in
that
instance
it
would
probably
be
covered.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
well
we
really
think
that's
only
true
in
this
context
and--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--let
me
explain
me
why.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
it's
true
in
this
context
for
one
reason.
what
erisa
is
really
looking
at
was
private
arrangements
between
employers
and
employees,
where
employers
create
promises
to
pay
certain
kind
of
fringe
benefits
their
employees.
and
what
we
would
contend
under
those
circumstances
is
that
what
congress
was
really
focusing
on
were
the
kinds
of
problems
that
had
developed
with
respect
to
those
kinds
of
private
arrangements.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
what
we're
suggesting,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
wording
of
the
statute
has
to
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
underlying
policies
of
the
erisa
statute.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
what
you've
got,
the
definition
of
an
erisa
plan
is
a
plan
or
fund
which
provides
certain
kinds
of
employee
benefits
and
which
is
either
established
or
maintained
by
an
employer.
so
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
if
you
don't
have
something
which
rises
to
the
level
of
an
erisa
plan,
and
if
you
don't
have
a
plan
which
is
created
by
an
employer,
or
which
is
maintained
by
an
employer,
then
we
think
you're
out
of
the
statute
just
on
the
wording
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
i
think
if
you
have
an
ongoing
benefit
program--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--that,
payable
to
employees
over
time--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--but
that
would
be
something--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--it
does
not.
it
requires
them
to
make
a
payment
xxx.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
well
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
i
think
that
was
what
mr.
yavis--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--if
it
were,
if
you
had
an
erisa
coverage
severance
pay
plan--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--totally,
privately
created
it
would
be
subject
to
all
of
the
obligations
and
all
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
erisa
and
that
would
include
the
requirement
of
maintaining
the
assets
in
a
separate
entity
under
a
trust
fund
with
the
various
disclosure
obligations
that
would
be
entailed
and
we
don't
think
that
any
of
those--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
well
if
an
employer--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--it
would
be
an
erisa
plan,
or
it
could
be
an
erisa
plan
and
in
that
instance
the
maine
law--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--well,
i
guess
if
i
understand
your
question,
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
an
employer
independently,
on
his
own,
creates
an
erisa
plan
or
reaches
a
contract
with
his
employees
to
pay
severance
pay,
that
would
have
two
effects.
first,
if
it
created
a
separate
erisa
plan,
that
would
be
subject
to
erisa.
and
second,
it
would
be
by
its
own
terms,
it
would
be
taken
out
of
the
maine
statute
pursuant
to
the
express
contract
exceptions.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
if
an
employer
creates
an
erisa
plan
in
response
to
the
maine
statute
that
would
be
an
erisa
plan.
i
don't
think
that
the
question
is
whether
the
employer's
payment
of
the
benefits
called
for
under
the
statute
constitutes
an
erisa
plan
and
that's--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--according
to
the
maine
statute.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
we
don't
think
that
that
bare
fact
constitutes
an
erisa
plan.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
well,
if
it
were
an
erisa
plan
i
think
that
an
argument
could
be
made
that
in
that
point
the
maine
law
was
relating
to
the
erisa
plan,
or
forcing
it--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--well
maine,
if
the
maine
law
were
interpreted
to
relate
to
an
erisa
plan
then
the
maine
law
would
be
preempted.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
i
think
that
that
would
create
a
preemption
problem,
your
honor,
yes.
what
i'm
really
trying
to
do
is--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
i
think
that
is
what
the
solicitor,
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
he
would
and
let
me
explain
why
i
think
that's
wrong.
the
preemption
provision
of
erisa,
which
is
the
source
of
the
preemption
argument
in
this
case
relates
to
the,
it
contains
the
following
language:
it
preempts
state
laws
insofar
as
those
laws
relate
to
an
erisa
covered
plan.
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
solicitor
general's
argument
would
essentially
re-write
the
statute
to
say
that
it
preempts
state
laws
which
relate
to
employee
benefits.
and
if
that's
correct,
then
we
would
concede
that
the
maine
law
would
be
preempted.
but
we
don't
think
that's
correct.
we
think
congress
focused
on
the
word,
plan,
in
the
preemption
provision
as
it
focused
on
the
word,
plan,
throughout
the
erisa
statute
with
specific
intent
to
subject
only
erisa
plans
to
federal
regulation.
and--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--i
think
that's,
it
might,
your
honor.
it
might.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
i
believe
they
do.
and
i
think
if
you
look,
and
i'm
not
sure
if
its
in
the
statutory
appendix.
i
believe
if
you
look
in,
i
believe
it's
section
1101
of
29
u.s.c.,
it
talks
about
the
various
funding
requirements
that
assets
be
held
in
a
trust
and
so
in
that
sense
i
think
you're
talking
at
least
about
trust
assets.
i
don't
know
whether
the
employer
would
actually
have
to
set
aside
monies
for
those
plans,
but
i
think
you
would
at
least
have
to
create
a
separate
entity
which
met
the
definitions
of
the
trust
and
the
fiduciary
requirements
under
erisa.
to
go
back
to
the
point
i
was
making
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
i
think
that
really
that's
what
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case
turns
on,
which
is
the
question
of
whether
erisa
preempts
state
laws
relating
to
employee
benefits,
or
whether
erisa
preempts
state
laws
relating
to
employee
benefit
plans.
and
if
i
may,
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
just
point
out
the
specific
meaning
of
plan
as
i
understand
it,
in
light
of
the
congressional
intent
behind
erisa.
and
that's--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--i
mean
plan
as
defined
in
erisa.
the
word
plan
is
obviously
something
that
in
the,
outside
the
statutory
context
could
be
made
susceptible
to
many
meanings.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
that's
correct.
and
i'm
referring
to
both.
the
plans
that
i
think
congress
was
focusing
on
were
these
private
arrangements
created
between
employer
and
employee
and
what
they
were
specifically
worried
about
were
some
of
the
abuses
that
began
to
be
seen
in
the
context
of
those
plans.
and
those
abuses
were--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--your
honor--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--no.
and
maybe
i
can
clarify
that.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
it's
the
state
mandate
that
that
takes
a
plan
out
of
erisa.
the
question
is
whether
what
the
state
is
mandating
is
an
erisa
covered
plan.
and
that
is
really,
i
think,
the
question
that's
before
the
court
today.
and
that's
the
issue
that
i
think
we're
interested
in
arguing
about.
that's
where
we
really
part
company
with
mr.
yavis.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
if
all
the
employer
does
is
comply
with
the
maine
law
then
we
would
say
that
the
employer
is
not
subject
to
any
erisa
obligation.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
i
think
the
secretary's
position
is
that
the
maine
law
itself
requires
the
creation
of
an
erisa
covered
plan
and
following
from
that
premise,
it
would
argue
that
the
maine
law
is
preempted.
i
don't
think
that
if
the
secretary--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--that
is,
i
think,
the
secretary's
position.
and,
i
think
that
the
secretary--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--and
i
think
that's
both
right,
justice
o'connor,
and
what
i'm
really
suggesting
is
that
the
secretary's
position,
or
at
least
as
reported
by
the
solicitor
general,
seems
to
be
that
merely
requiring
a
benefit
is,
that
statement
alone,
that
requirement
alone
is
sufficient
to
create
an
erisa
covered
plan.
that's--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
well
the
hawaii
pre-paid
health
care
act
which
is
the
act
that
you're
referring
to
is
an
act
which
really
goes
way
beyond
what
maine
does.
it
doesn't
just
require
a
one-time
payment
in
the
event
of
a
plant
closing,
it
required
employers
to
establish
a
comprehensive,
on-going
system
of
providing
health
benefits.
and
it
included
within
that,
it
was,
that
system
was
imposed
upon
existing
erisa
plans.
it
required
employers
to
alter
and
amend
their
existing
erisa
plans
and
it
also
contained
certain
reporting
requirements
which
went
beyond,
or
conflicted
with,
what
erisa
itself
requires.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
of
the
hawaii
act
was
a
fairly
easy
case
and
what
congress
then
did
in
response
to
a
court
decision
was
to
suggest
that
certain
features
of
the
hawaiian
law,
not
all
of
them,
not
the
conflicting
reporting
provisions,
but
certain
features
would
not
be
preempted.
and
the
legislative
history
on
that
as
the
solicitor
general's
brief
i
think
itself
includes
is
somewhat
conflicting
in
that
the
senate
committee
said
that
it
felt
that
preemption
of
the
hawaii
law
was
inadvertent.
and
there
is
other
statements
made
that
the
decision
in
the
hawaii
case
was
exactly
correct.
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
statements
are
not
necessarily
a
reliable
guide
to
what
congress
meant
when
it
enacted
the
original
preemption
provision
in
erisa.
but
in
any
event
that
those
statements
really
don't
provide
guidance
here
in
view
of
the
fundamental
differences
between
this
law
and
the
hawaii
law.
and
that,
i
think,
gets
me
back
to
the
issue
of
why
this
law
does
not
create
an
erisa
covered
plan.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
really
three
reasons
for
that.
the
first
is
the
one
that
i
already
mentioned,
which
is
it
does
not
create
a
private
arrangement
between
employer
and
employee
and
it
is
not
subject
to
the
kinds
of
abuses,
the
kinds
of
problems
that
motivated--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--i
think
you
have
to
do
both,
your
honor,
but
as
mr.
yavis
stated
that
the
term
plan
itself
is
not
defined
in
erisa
and
i
think
to
gain
enlightenment
as
to
what
congress
was
worrying
about
you
have
to
look
at
the
congressional
findings
and
declaration
of
policy--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--they
are
indeed.
but
i'm
focusing
now
on--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--well
the
argument
that
that
reached
the
severance
plans
is
based
upon
the
incorporation
within
the
definition
of
a
reference
to
certain
benefits
provided
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
186(c).
and
186(c)
refers
to
severance
benefits.
so
that's
how
severance
benefits
come
in
although
i
can--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--we
don't
dispute
that
erisa
would
govern
a
plan
which
provided
severance
benefits
and
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
erisa
does
not
necessarily
cover
the
entire
topic
of
severance
benefits.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
going
back
to
the
issue
of
whether
this
creates
a
plan,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
first
got
the
question
of
private
arrangements.
you've
second
got
the
question
which
i
think
is
presented
in
the
unique
form
by
this
case
of
whether
a
one
time
statutory
assessment
constitutes
the
kind
of
plan
that
was
contemplated
under
erisa.
the
ordinary
erisa
plan
involves
an
ongoing
system
of
paying
benefits
over
time.
it's
a
system
that
of
necessity
has
to
be
maintained
xxx--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--from
the
point
of
view
of
each
employee--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--it
might
be
a
one
shot
severance
pay,
but--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--well
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
employer,
the
ordinary
severance
plan
is
paid
to
a
group
of
employees
as
they
depart
the
employment
relationship
over
time.
in
other
words,--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--they're
talking
about
administering
the
payment
of
benefits
over--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--i'm
talking
about
a
plant
closing
and
that's
exactly
what
maine
law
is
talking
about.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
but
for
the
same
reason,
we
agree
that
erisa
does
and
it's
the,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
beneficiary,
justice
o'connor,
the
death
benefit
is
probably
a
one
payment.
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
employer
however,
you're
talking
about
death
benefits
that
are
going
to
be
paid
to
a
group
of
employees
over
time.
you're
not
talking
about
a
one
time
payment
in
the
event
of
a
single
contingency
to
all
the
employees
who
are
eligible
at
once.
it's
a
one
time
payment
and
we
suggest
that
there's
language
in
the
9th
circuit
martori
brothers
case
and
in
donovan
v.
dillingham
which
is
the
11th
circuit
en
banc
decision
which
suggests
that
a
one
time
payment
would
not
be
subject
necessarily
to
erisa
because
it
would
not
constitute
a
plan.
and
a
lot
of
courts
have
tried
to
grope
with
what
constitutes
a
plan.
but
we
would
submit
that
what
falls
outside
of
a
plan
is
a
one
time
payment.
the
other
problem
with
the
argument
that
the
maine
law
creates
an
erisa
covered
plan
in
this
case
is
the
one
averted
to
by
justice
stevens
in
one
of
his
earlier
questions
which
is
that
if
this
law
is
deemed
to
create
an
erisa
covered
plan
then
it
would
preempt
state
law
even
in
a
circumstance
where
an
employer
had
no
plan.
and
under
those
circumstances
we
really
think
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
erisa
preemption
to
apply.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
if
this--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--right.
if
this
law
were
interpreted
to
require
an
erisa
covered
plan
and
were
therefore
preempted
on
the
basis
that
it
relates
to
an
erisa
covered
plan--
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
--which
it,
itself
creates
then
that
law
would
be
preempted
even
in
the
case
of
an
employer
who
had
no
absolutely
no
existing
erisa
plan
at
the
time.
and
we
suggest
that
that
goes
way
beyond
what
congress
intended
to
preempt
in
the
erisa
preemption
section.
mr.
thomas
d.
warren
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
state
requires
something
and
it
doesn't
relate
to
a
plan
within
the
meaning
of
section
514,
then
the
state's
proscription
is
not
preempted.
in
other
words,
as
i
think
this
court
ruled
in
shaw
v.
delta
airlines,
the
state
law
is
only
preempted
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
erisa
covered
plan.
so
if
you
don't
have
any
relationship
with
an
erisa
covered
plan,
the
state
law
remains
in
effect.
and
what
we're
suggesting
here
is
where
an
employer
has
no
plan
it
would
in
our
view
stretch
congressional
intent
beyond
what
it's
proper
bounds
to
suggest
a
preemption.
what
i
really
want
to,
in
focusing
on
this
there's
this
one
principal
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
and
that
is
this,
that
the
issue
of
preemption
and
the
interpretation
of
the
preemption
provision
it
seems
to
me
has
to
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
fundamental
principle
that
preemption
is
not
a
favorite
doctrine
and
that
has
been
stated
by
this
court
in,
i
think,
as
early
as
the
florida
lime
and
avocado
case
is
saying
that
preemption
should
not
be
found
unless
congress
unmistakably
intended
to
displace
state
law.
that
follows
from
principles
of
preemption
which
we
believe
this
court
is
fully
familiar
with.
it
follows
from
respect
for
state
law.
it
follows
from
a
respect
for
the
states
as
sovereign
entitles
and
a
respect
for
state's
authority
to
meet
the
problems
of
its
residents
through
its
police
power
and
we
submit
that
that's
exactly
what
maine
has
done
here.
the
problem
of
plant
closings
is
not
unique
to
maine,
but
it's
a
particular
problem
in
maine
because
of
the
number
of
maine
towns
where
one
major
plant
is
a
dominant
employer.
so
maine
has
adopted
a
statue
which
no
other
state
has
adopted
to
meet
this
problem.
it's
designed
to
deal
with
the
specific
unemployment
problem
created
by
a
plant
closing
and
we
submit
that
maine
is
entitled
to
devise
its
own
response
to
this
particular
problem
absent
a
clear
expression
by
congress
that
the
maine
law
is
preempted
on
this
subject.
and
this
brings
me
back
to
where
i
began,
i
think,
which
is
that
we
do
not
think
that
the
arrangement,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
created
by
maine
law,
the
statutory
obligation
which
is
a
bare
statutory
obligation
to
pay
severance
benefits.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
resembles
the
kind
of
employee
benefit
plan
which
congress
was
intending
to
regulate
when
it
enacted
erisa.
i
see
my
time
has
almost
expired.
let
me
just
say
about
the
other
argument
that
we
have
raised,
the
unemployment
compensation
law
argument,
that
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to,
not
only
to
our
arguments
on
that
subject,
but
to
those
submitted
by
the
afl-cio
in
its
amicus
brief.
and
specifically
the
point
that
they
make
which
is
that
the
average,
traditional
unemployment
compensation
law
is
not
a
law
which
resembles
an
erisa
covered
plan.
therefore
the
exemption
from
erisa
for
plans
maintained
solely
to
comply
with
unemployment
compensation
laws
really
doesn't
make
much
sense
when
applied
to
a
traditional
law.
