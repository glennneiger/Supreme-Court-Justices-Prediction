mr.
francis
h.
fox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mass
citizens
for
life
is
a
non-profit
ideological
grassroots
corporation,
raising
money
by
means
of
individual
donations,
garage
sales,
cake
sales,
and
the
like,
devoting
itself
to
the
purposes
of
advancing
life
of
the
born
and
unborn
as
it
sees
those
purposes
through
legislative,
lobbying,
political,
ideological
means,
across
a
spectrum
of
activities
relating
to
fetal
research,
euthanasia,
abortion.
mass
citizens
for
life
has
never
accepted
any
business
money.
mass
citizens
for
life
has
never
made
a
contribution
to
a
candidate--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
--no
labor
union
money,
no
business
money.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
depending
upon
what
substantial
evil
this
statute
is
designed
to
curb,
if
one
of
them
is
the
accumulation
of
money
from
the
commercial
world
that
might
flow
into
the
political
process,
i'm
only
mentioning
that
they
have
never
accepted
business
money,
this
particular
corporation.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
have
a
lesser
claim,
but
nonetheless
one
that
would
carry
the
day
with
respect
to
this
particular
message,
which
says:
vote,
and
here
are
the
492
candidates
that
are
up
for
office,
and
here
are
their
positions.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
legitimate
exercise
on
the
part
of
the
government.
if
disclosure
in
and
of
itself
is
a
good,
and
i
think
that
up
to
a
point
it
is,
so
that
people
should
know
whether
the
business
community
or
the
medical
community
or
some
other
group
is
behind
a
particular
candidate
or
against
one,
i
think
then
that
a
statute
could
be
passed
saying
that
any
charitable
corporation
or
ideological
corporation
wishing
to
engage
in
independent
expenditures
should
reveal
all
business
money
or
all
labor
money
it
has
been
fortunate
enough
to
get
in
the
last
year.
that
is
not
this
statute.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well,
we
think
that
it
is
unduly
burdensome
with
respect
to
an
ideological
corporation
whose
purposes
may
be
controversial.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
oh,
if
your
honor
please,
any
independent
expenditure
does
have
to
be
disclosed.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
oh,
no.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
if
it's
more
than
$250,
anyone
who
makes
an
independent
expenditure
must
disclose
it.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
yes,
if
this
court
were
to
rule
that
we
may
make
them
at
all.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well,
if...
we're
talking
about
a
hypothetical
statute.
if
there
were
a
statute
that
wanted
to
ferret
out
business
money
and
if--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
--if
a
political
committee
were
to
file
its
disclosure,
it
must
disclose
any
contributions
that
it
has
received
over
$200.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
basic
way
that
my
brother
argues
that
that
could
be
done
by
a
corporation
is
to
set
up
a
separate,
segregated
fund.
the
way
the
fec
interprets
this
statute,
mass
citizens
for
life
cannot
out
of
its
corporate
till
make
any
expenditure,
direct,
indirect,
what
have
you.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
and
he
says
if
we
set
up
a
pac,
then
that
pac
would
have
to
disclose,
again
only
up
to
$200.
but
there
is
a
burdensome
requirement
with
respect
to
the
pac.
amazingly
detailed
books
must
be
kept
and,
most
importantly,
the
membership
of
that
pac
is
the
only...
the
membership
of
the
parent
organization
are
the
only
people
to
whom
a
pac
may
go
to
solicit
contributions.
so
that
if
you
have
an
organization
such
as
mass
citizens
for
life,
which
has
80
to
100
chapters
throughout
the
state,
and
a
chapter
meeting
occurs
on
a
wednesday
in
november
and
30
people
show
up,
you
may
not
solicit
a
contribution
for
your
pac
from
those
people
unless
you
are
clear
that
back
at
the
headquarters
that
person's
name
appears
as
a
member
on
some
file
card.
if
you
say,
well,
i'll
take
your
membership
fee
now
and
then
you
may
give
to
the
pac,
that's
dangerous.
you
may
be
implicitly
soliciting
to
the
pac
when
you
ask
him
to
join.
the
30
people
who
show
up
the
next
month
may
be
different
from
the
30
people
who
show
up
this
month.
are
they
members,
are
they
not
members?
may
you
within
the
law
solicit
a
contribution
to
your
pac?
i
think
it
would
be
dangerous.
now,
these
are
burdensome
requirements,
and
the
disclosure
that
is
required
is
of
course
burdensome.
every
nickel
that
is
spent
for
paperclips
or
anything
else
must
be
disclosed.
names
and
addresses,
though
only
up
to
$200,
must
be
disclosed.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
over
$200,
yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
no,
but
i
think
that
without
a
compelling
purpose
and
one
served
by
the
narrowest
means
available,
there
shouldn't
be
any
burdens
placed
on
the
ability
of
organizations
of
individuals
to
make
such
a
message
as
was
made
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
the
cases
that
this
court
has
addressed
itself
to
in
this
field,
the
ncpac,
national
right
to
work,
and
all
the
others,
dealt
with
contributions
to
candidates.
it
has
been
perceived
by
this
court
that
contributions,
where
there
is
a
contribution
to
a
candidate
and
perhaps
a
debt
is
created
that
is
going
to
be
paid
back
out
of
the
public
trust
when
that
candidate
gets
elected,
that
has
the
propensity
for
corruption.
eqally,
this
court
has
held
that
totally,
thoroughly
independent
expenditures
trigger
no
such
concern,
because
of
the
lack
of
control
which
that
candidate
has.
he
cannot
control
the
spending,
and
this
court
in
buckley
has
actually
recognized
that
such
spending
might
be
counterproductive
to
that
candidate.
so
we
have
a
situation
of
independent
expenditures,
according
to
the
rulings
of
this
court,
that
do
not
implicate
corruption.
and
in
that
respect,
the
imposition
of
any
burden...
and
there
are
substantial
burdens,
not
insurmountable,
i'll
agree,
but
substantial
burdens...
are
unjustified.
the
organization--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
--yes,
your
honor.
if
protection
of
minority
interests
is
raised
as
a
justification
for
this
statute,
i
would
say,
number
one,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here
that
would
indicate
any
hint
of
opposition
to
spreading
voting
records
concerning
where
the
candidates
are
on
this
issue
about
which
the
organization
exists.
number
two,
the
minority
interests
are
not
well
protected
by
a
statute
which
says
you
may
not
spend
any
of
the
joint
money,
none
of
the
money
from
your
till,
for
any
purpose,
lest
some
minority
interest
in
that
statute
take
offense.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
not
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i'm
not
sure
that
is
so
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
the
separate
segregated
fund,
as
the
fec
argues,
could
spend
for
the
administration
of
the
pac,
for
the
solicitation
for
the
pac,
for
the
setting
up
of
the
pac.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
they
would
dip
into
the--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
--the
money
that
you
raise
would
be
controlled
by
the
officers
of
the
organization.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
it
doesn't
say.
please
contribute
to
our
pac
if
you
are
in
line
with
our
goals.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
yes,
you
will
know
that.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well,
if
your
honor
please--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
--you
won't
know
either
way
what
candidates
are
going
to
be
favored.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
yes,
that's
correct.
you
will
have
some
more
pointed
view.
but
the
general
till
may
be
used
to
support
the
pac,
the
offices
of
the
corporation
may
pick
what
candidates
will
be
favored
and
what
will
not.
and
there
comes
a
point
where,
if
you
are
in
an
organization,
a
corporation
or
a
labor
organization
or
what
have
you,
you
have
to
trust
the
leaders
of
that
organization
to
make
decisions
compatible
with
your
desires
or
you
leave.
it
is
not
necessary
to
set
up
an
absolute
prohibition
for
the
use
of
treasury
funds
to
spend
on
printing
a
message.
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
the
message
here,
the
basic
and
overwhelming
significant
of
the
message,
was
the
gathering
together
of
the
positions
of
492
candidates,
and
then
that
was
to
be
distributed.
that
message
could
be
used
by
a
pro-choice
person
equally
with
a
pro-life,
to
know
where
the
candidates
line
up.
you
have
the
information
right
here
that
will
assist
you.
the
message
also
said
this
is
not
to
be
an
endorsement
of
any
candidate.
there
were--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
--i
don't
say
that
it
would
take
a
psychiatrist
to
figure
out
which
side
of
issue
the
authors
of
his
message
were
on,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
there
is
no
doubt
what
their
subjective
hopes
would
be.
but
many
of
the
races
had
people
who
where
equally
bad
or
equally
good
on
both
sides,
and
it
just
served
up
the
information.
some
of
the
pictures
here,
there
would
be
a
republican
and
a
democrat
for
senator.
and
it
does
not
expressly
say
you
must
vote
for
smith,
please.
it
says
vote
pro-life.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i'm
not
sure
about
tip
o'neil,
your
honor.
his
picture
is--
[laughter]
his
picture
is
prominently
displayed,
and
no
one
really
knows.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
the
briefs
have
set
forth
various
positions
here,
varying
constitutional
interpretations
which
would
exclude
or
include
various
organizations
depending
upon
what
this
court
were
to
believe
was
the
evil
that
was
to
be
combatted.
if
the
evil
is
corruption,
then
independent
expenditures
do
not
trigger
corruption
and
one
would
think
that
any
organization,
a
business
organization,
an
ideological
organization,
or
any
other
organization,
could
make
independent
expenditures.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well,
that
interest
this
court
has
stated
in
cort
v.
ash
is
but
a
secondary
concern,
if
at
all,
of
this
statute.
it
is
not
well
served,
and
there
could
be
some
kind
of
a
requirement
that
there
be
an
80
percent
vote
of
all
members.
there
could
be
less
restrictive
methods
than
to
say
the
corporate
till
is
off
limits
for
the
payment
of
printing
costs
for
this
message.
there
could
be
less
restrictive
means
of
securing
that
particular
goal.
that
is
not
really
the
goal
of
this
statute.
the
goal
here
has
been
articulated
by
this
court
to
be
the
avoidance
of
the
fact
or
the
appearance
of
corruption
in
many
cases.
that
is
what
has
been
held
to
be
the
evil
that
congress
was
trying
to
come
to
grips
with.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
mentioned
as
a
secondary
concern
and
it
is
there.
but
it
is
not
well
served
by
this
statute.
on
this
record,
there
is
absolutely
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
anyone
of
the
members
of
this
organization
would
have
any
problem
with
the
position
taken
by
this
organization
in
distributing
voting
records.
and
the
court
in
the
first
national
bank
versus
bellotti
case
mentioned
it
on
the
record
in
that
case
that
there
has
been
no
indication
of
a
minority
problem.
in
every
case
that
comes
along,
no
one
seems
to
see
that
there
is
any
indication
that
minority
interests
are
not
being
well
represented.
but
if
that
were
the
goal,
a
better
statute
could
be
drafted.
the
newsletters
themselves
have
been
published
from
1973
to
1978,
and
they're
all
in
a
separate
appendix
here,
every
one
of
them.
that's
the
relevant
time
frame.
we
have
also
filed
with
the
court
one
each
of
the
originals
of
these
newsletters,
and
here
is
the
special
election
edition
that
gives
rise
to
this
lawsuit.
it
covers
492
candidates
with
their
positions.
it
looks
like
a
newspaper.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
it
has
a
y
and
an
n
or
nr.
it's
a
box
score.
the
y
is
a
position
on
one
of
the
three
questions
that
aligns
itself
with
the
pro-life
view
as
they
saw
it
here,
and
the
n
is
no
and
nr
is
no
response.
gathered
from
congressional
voting
records
for
incumbents
and
questionnaires
for
non-incumbents.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
if
there
is
a
single
message
perhaps,
it
would
be
make
pro-life
be
the
one
issue
that
you
should
address
yourself
to,
not
elect
smith
or
don't
elect
jones.
here's
the
information
on
which
you
may
live
up
to
your
principles.
the
newsletter
was
started
as
the
most
important
activity
of
this
organization,
and
has
been
published
since
its
first
one
in
1973,
maybe
four
to
eight
times
a
years
as
funds
would
allow.
whenever
there
was
as
election
year,
the
organization
would
come
out
with
a
special
election
edition,
gathering
the
votes
as
it
did
here,
or
the
statements
of
position.
as
to
the
constitutional
arguments,
section
441
implicates
freedom
of
expression,
freedom
of
association,
and
freedom
of
the
press:
freedom
of
expression
because
speech
concerning
the
qualification
of
candidates
or
elected
officials
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
first
amendment's
concerns
and
supports
an
enlightened
electorate;
freedom
of
association
because
the
ability
of
like-minded
individuals
to
gather
together
and
communicate
to
the
outside
world,
enhancing
the
weak
voices
of
the
members,
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
american
way
of
life
and
american
history,
especially
where
the
message
concerns
those
who
would
be
our
leaders.
freedom
of
the
press
is
implicated
because
that
cherished
freedom
applies
to
the
humblest
handbills
handed
out
on
a
corner
by
tom
payne
equally
with
the
slick
products
of
our
modern
dailies.
freedom
of
the
press
is
not
a
captive
of
the
media
conglomerates.
the
first
circuit
has
held
that,
although
the
statute
applies,
overruling
three
reasons
that
the
district
court
found
the
statute
should
not
be
deemed
to
apply,
still
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
and
legislation
which
implicates
those
three
concerns
to
the
extend
that
i
have
articulated
will
only
be
allowed
to
impose
restrictions
if
they
serve
the
most
evil
and
survive
strict
scrutiny
from
this
court,
and
indeed
serve
that
substantial
evil
in
the
least
restrictive
manner.
now,
with
respect
to
corruption,
the
court,
as
i
have
indicated,
has
implicated...
has
said,
has
held
loudly,
that
contributions
do
give
rise
to
that
propensity
because
the
candidate
my
repay
out
of
the
public
trust,
but
independent
expenditures
do
not.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
recognize
another
purpose
to
be
served,
a
compelling
purpose
that
will
allow
quantitative
restrictions
on
speech...
that
is
what
this
is,
a
quantitative
restriction
on
speech
by
a
quantitative
restriction
on
money.
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
the
requirement
of
keeping
business
money
out
of
elections
were,
despite
the
previous
holdings
of
this
court,
a
compelling
purpose,
it
can
be
served
by
statutes
less
restrictive
than
this,
because
this
statute
prohibits
mass
citizens
for
life
from
spending
$9800
here
to
distribute
voting
records
of
492
candidates
by
means
of
a
newsletter,
although
they
never
had
any
business
money
in
their
till
and
they
never
made
a
contribution
to
any
candidate
or
a
coodinated
expenditure
in
their
whole
existence.
a
statute
could
be
articulated
that
would
try
to
keep
out
business
money
by
disclosure.
if
you
want
to
make
an
independent
expenditure,
mr.
charitable
corporation,
tell
us
all
your
business
money
and
so
on.
lesser
restrictive,
but
still
intrusive,
methods
could
be
devised.
but
these
blanket
prohibitions
that
prohibit
the
independent
expenditure
of
this
organization
that
never
had
any
business
money
cannot
be
justified.
now,
the
disclosure
that
the
fec
says
is
to
be
served
here
justifies
this
intrusion
into
the
heart
of
the
first
amendment
on
the
grounds
of
disclosure.
i'll
say
three
things
on
that:
one,
section
441(b)
is
not
a
disclosure
statute;
two,
there
is
disclosure
already
required
in
the
statutes;
three,
further
disclosure
more
burdensome
and
intrusive
is
not
warranted.
first,
section
441(b)
as
interpreted
by
the
fec
is
not
a
disclosure
statute.
it
is
an
absolute
prohibition.
it
must
rise
or
fall
depending
upon
whether
an
absolute
prohibition
is
warranted
under
these
circumstances.
section
441(b)
does
not
say:
you
corporations
spend
what
you
want,
only
disclose
what
you're
about.
section
441(b)
says:
you
people
have
chosen
a
tainted
form
in
which
to
conduct
your
activities;
the
assets
that
you
accumulate
from
your
day
to
day
activities
are
poison;
they
must
be
walled
off
from
the
political
process,
even
in
the
form
of
independent
expenditures.
section
441(b)
says,
as
the
fec
points
out:
if
you
wish
to
set
up
a
committee,
and
if
that
committee
then
solicits
special
contributions
from
your
members,
not
from
people
who
may
be
sympathetically
inclined
but
from
people
whose
names
appear
in
your
card
index,
then
you
may
use
that
money
for
independent
expenditures,
but
you
may
not
use
your
corporate
till
do
pay
for
your
message,
your
political
message,
no
matter
how
modest
the
amount.
this
cannot
be
squared
with
freedom
of
association.
the
second
point--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
--garage
sales,
dances.
they're
all
individual
contributions
or--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
--well,
this
case
pointed
out
some
very
weak
bookkeeping
records
on
the
part
of
this
organization.
the
organization
claimed
50,000
members,
the
organization
had
6,000
dues-paying
members.
the
articles
of
organization
in
the
state
house
said
we
have
no
members.
"members"
was
a
loose
concept
with
these
people.
but
with
all
these
hundred
chapters
throughout
the
towns
and
people
coming
and
going,
contributions
would
be
made
and
so
on.
and
they
considered
them
members,
but
they
weren't
in
some
official
sense.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
it
did
not
provide
for
members.
it
said
"none"
in
that.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well,
at
that
time
the
officers...
there
were
maybe
25
of
them,
or
a
board
of
directors...
would
elect
themselves,
and
people
would
come
on
and
replace
them.
it
was
very
loose.
it
has
been
tightened
up
since
the
fec
brought
this
lawsuit.
but
i
want
to
make
the
point
on
disclosure
that
anyone
who
makes
any
independent
expenditure
for
$250
or
more
must
disclose
it.
that
purposes
is
already
served.
if
this
organization
were
allowed
to
make
such
independent
expenditures,
they
would
have
to
reveal
that
they
make
the
expenditures.
but
the
purpose
of
keeping
business
money
out
of
the
electoral
process
is
not
served
by
this
statute
because
of
its
underinclusive
impact.
a
business
organization,
a
partnership,
an
association,
limited
partnerships,
a
joint
venture,
need
not
have
any
limit
on
the
amount
of
money
that
it
can
spend
independently,
no
limit.
true,
it
must
disclose
if
it
spends
more
than
$250.
and
if
any
contribution
in
furtherance
of
an
independent
expenditure
is
received,
that
must
be
disclosed,
as
must
anyone
who
makes
a
disclosure
making
an
independent
expenditure.
but
these
entities
that
are
out
in
the
business
world
making
literally
millions
and
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
from
commerce
may
spend
in
an
unlimited
amount,
as
long
as
the
major
purpose
does
not
become
the
election
of
candidates,
in
which
case
they
transform
themselves
into
a
political
committee.
so
there
is
no
purpose
to
be
served
by
allowing
an
organization
making
$30
million
a
year
to
spend
unlimited
amounts
and
not
allowing
an
ideological
incorporated
organization
from
spending
anything,
if
your
purpose
is
to
keep
business
money
out
of
the
electoral
processes.
one
further
statutory
point.
there
is
an
exemption
under
the
general
definition
of
expenditure
for
newspapers
and
periodical
publications.
those
terms
are
not
defined
in
the
statute
or
in
the
regs.
i
think
that
this
court
should
conclude
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
squelch
a
publication
like
this
when
it
granted
that
exemption.
it
would
be
a
non-constitutional
way
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
in
conclusion
on
this
matter,
when
one
considers
all
the
election
law
cases
that
this
court
has
had
in
the
last
40
years...
uaw,
cio,
the
pipefitters
in
the
seventies,
ncpac,
national
right
to
work...
this
case
involving
a
$9800
expenditure
to
publish
a
newsletter
containing
492
candidates'
positions,
$20
apiece,
constitutes
the
most
insignificant,
the
most
puny
threat
of
any
case
that
has
come
before
this
court.
but
when
you
consider
the
fundamental
principles
that
bind
us
together...
freedom
of
association,
that
ability
of
individual
of
like
minds
to
gather
together
and
enhance
their
weak,
faint
voices;
freedom
of
the
press;
freedom
of
speech...
this
perhaps
is
the
most
significant
of
all.
the
idea
that
even
now,
in
the
last
two
decades
of
the
twentieth
century,
an
organization
like
mass
citizens
must
stand
before
this
bar
and
justify
having
produced
a
newsletter
containing
voting
records
is
appalling.
the
basic
problem
with
the
fec's
case
is
it
was
brought
200
years
too
late.
thank
you.
