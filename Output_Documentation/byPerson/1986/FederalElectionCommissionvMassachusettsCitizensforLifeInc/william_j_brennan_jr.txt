jr.
mr.
steele,
i
think
you
said
earlier
that
the...
is
it
441(b)
has
its
source
in
the
old
corrupt
practices
acts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
80
years
ago
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
80
years
ago,
believe
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
corruption
which
provoked
that
statute
at
the
time,
is
it
the
sort
of
thing
that's
ordinarily
even
associated
with
non-profit
corporations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
assuming
that's
what
the
statute
says
and
that
it
may
embrace
non-profit
corporations,
i
suppose
the
first
amendment
question
is
whether
it
can
be
constitutional
as
applied
to
a
non-profit
corporation
like
this,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
wondered.
certainly
the
kind
of
corrupt
practices
which
gave
us
the
corrupt
practices
act,
is
it
or
isn't
it
the
case,
are
not
usually
associated
with
non-profit
corporations?
i
mean,
non-profit
corporations
don't
have
these
accumulations
of
wealth
that
were
the
seed
for
for
the
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
recognize
that
the
first
amendment
problem
is
rather
more
difficult
as
addressed
to
a
non-profit
corporation
than
it
is
to
a
profit
corporation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fox,
has
it
accepted
any
labor
union
money?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
because
in
your
submission
the
first
amendment
protects
you.
