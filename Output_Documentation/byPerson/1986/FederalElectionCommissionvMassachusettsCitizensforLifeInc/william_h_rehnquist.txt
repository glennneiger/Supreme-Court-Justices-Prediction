you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready,
mr.
steele.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
it's
the
organization
that
apprises
the
people,
not
the
fund?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
congress
require
that
the
publisher
of
a
newspaper
along
with
every
edition
of
the
newspaper
list
all
the
stockholders
of
the
newspaper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
suppose
it
changed
its
mind?
would
a
requirement
like
that
be
constitutional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
different
from
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
steele,
do
i
detect
from
one
of
your
earlier
comments
that
you
think
congress
may
have
shifted
gears
to
a
certain
extent
in
1947
from
1907
when
it
brought
in
unions,
i
guess
many
of
which
are
certainly
not
supposed
to
be
in
business
to
make
money?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
steele.
we'll
hear
from
you
next,
mr.
fox.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
over
$200.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fox,
the
way
you
describe
those
requirements,
it
seems
to
me
you
really
have
to
strain
to
say
they
are
burdensome.
i
can
see
how
they
would
be
a
nuisance
and
you
have
to
devote
some
of
your
money,
some
of
your
time
to
complying
with
those.
but
they're
certainly
not
insuperable,
are
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
connection
with
expenditures
in
connection
with
elections,
we
have
sustained
a
lot
of
things
that
we
wouldn't
sustain
if
it
were
just
on
someone's
right
to
communicate
on
a
street
corner
about
something.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
only
pictures
are
those
of
the
candidates
that
are
pro-life,
isn't
that
right?
the
others
don't
get
their
pictures
in?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
only
pro-life
candidates
had
their
pictures.
and
the
rule
for
which
you
contend,
or
the
holding
of
the
lower
court,
would
apply
even
if
the
publication
expressly
said
we
endorse
x,
y,
and
z,
wouldn't
it,
please
vote
for
mister
so-and-so?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
does
your
corporate
till
come
from,
mr.
fox,
other
than
from
the
contributions
of
members?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
aren't
those
individuals
who
contribute
members?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fox.
mr.
steele,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
about
six
minutes.
