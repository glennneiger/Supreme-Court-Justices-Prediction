justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
now
a
membership
corporation,
am
i
correct
about
that?
at
the
time
the
events
at
issue
here
occurred
it
was
not,
but
it
now
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
steele,
it's
clear...
or
maybe
it
isn't
clear.
could
the
commission...
could
the
congress
constitutionally
require
an
individual
who
wants
to
make
such
a
distribution
to
register
and
publicly
disclose
his
or
her
identity
and
the
amount
of
money
that
this
cost,
and
so
forth?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
steele,
what
is
the
threat
of
corruption
that's
involved
here,
even
from
regular
business
corporations?
you're
not
talking
about
business
corporations
getting
together
money
and
giving
it
to
a
candidate,
or
even
expending
the
money
in
the
way
that
the
candidate
directs.
these
are
independent
expenditures.
if
there's
any
connection
with
the
candidate,
if
they
say,
you
know,
in
exchange
for
our
doing
this
would
you
vote
this
way,
i
assume
that
that
would
make
it
a
connected
expenditure.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
none
of
that
involved.
what
risk
of
corruption
is
there
in
any
corporation,
profit
or
non-profit,
choosing
to
support
one
side
or
another
in
a
political
campaign?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
something
wrong
with
that?
there
is
something
wrong
with
a
political
candidate
not
making
any
commitment
to
people
that
work
hard
for
that
candidate?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
understand
there's
the
danger,
but
i
wouldn't
describe
that
as
corruption.
i
would
describe
that
as
the
normal
workings
of
the
political
process,
that
candidates
who
get
elected
tend
to
favor
the
interests
of
those
who
worked
hard
for
their
election.
if
that's
corruption,
we're
in
a
lot
of
trouble.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
you
object
to
disclosing,
however,
the
sources
of
the
$250?
you
object
to
having
to
disclose
where
you
got
the
money
that
you
expended
in
that
fashion?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
that
this
statute?
doesn't
this
statute
required
the
separate
fund
that
is
set
up
for
this
purpose...
don't
the
sources
of
that
income
have
to
be
disclosed?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
that
was...
i
thought
that
that
was
one
of
your
major
objections
here,
that
the
effect
of
this
scheme
is
to
require
your
organization
with
respect
to
any
money
that
it
wants
to
use
for
political
activity
to
disclose
the
names
of
its
contributors,
some
of
whom
might
want
to
remain
anonymous.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
but
you
could
set
up
a
pac.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fox,
just
so
we're
clear
about
the
message
here,
what
you
said
before
led
me
to
believe
you
were
going
to
assert
that
the
message
here
is
just
get
out
and
vote.
i
didn't
read
it
that
way.
it
was
really
get
out
and
vote
pro-life,
and
here
are
the
records
of
people
on
the
basis
of
who's
pro-life
and
who
is
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
was
not
just
get
out
and
vote,
but
vote
our
way
and
here's
something
to
help
you
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
nice
to
say
that,
but
when
you
also
say
vote
pro-life
doesn't
that
rather
contradict
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
[laughter]
