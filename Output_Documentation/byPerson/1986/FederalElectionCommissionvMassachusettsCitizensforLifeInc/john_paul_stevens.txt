mr.
steele,
earlier
in
your
argument
you
suggested
there
were
three
policies
that
you
relied
on
particularly.
one
was
disclosure,
another
was
the
avoidance
of
corruption,
as
i
understand.
but
i
don't
think
you've
told
us
what
the
third
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
a
similar
organization
in
a
different
state
did
accept
money
from
business
corporations.
would
it
have
a
lesser
claim
than
you
do
to
first
amendment
protection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
first
amendment
would
permit
the
government
to
pass
a
law
requiring
disclosure
of
whether
or
not
there
were
business
corporations
contributing
to
the
organization?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fox...
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
in
the
middle
of
an
answer,
but
i
did
have
a
concern
i
wanted
you
to
address
if
you
would.
mr.
steele
made
the
point
that,
with
respect
to
organizations
of
an
ideological
character
such
as
the
one
you
represent,
receive
a
great
many
contributions
which
perhaps
one
cannot
safely
assume
would
be
made
for
an
electoral
purpose.
they
might
be
very
sympathetic
with
the
organization,
but
not
necessarily
with
the
use
of
the
funds
to
elect
candidates.
they
like
the
lobbying,
they
like
the
research,
and
all
the
rest.
and
that
one
of
the
purposes
the
government
seeks
to
avoid
is
the
danger
that
people
will
be
supporting,
who
might
be
democrats
who
agree
with
most
of
the
objectives
of
your
organization,
but
would
not
want
to
support
republicans,
say.
could
you
address
that
concern.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
you're
arguing
you
have
a
right.
and
is
it
not
also
true...
and
i'm
not
saying
this
makes
your
position
stronger
or
weaker.
but
it's
not
just
your
organization
that's
at
stake
here,
but
there
are
a
whole
range
of
organizations,
i
supposed
churches
and
the
national
rifle
association,
a
lot
of
trade
associations,
there
are
all
sorts
of
groups
who
would
be
covered
by
the
rule
for
which
you
contend?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
evil
is
the
one
i
tried
to
describe
rather
clumsily
a
little
bit
ago,
that
you
want
to
be
sure
the
contributors
don't
just
feel
they
want
to
contribute
to
a
general
cause,
but
want
to
know
whether
they're
contributing
to
an
election
campaign?
what
if
that's
all
you're
interested
in?
doesn't
that
cut
across
all
these
organizations,
including
yours?
