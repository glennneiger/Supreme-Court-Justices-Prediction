mr.
charles
n.
steele
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
forward
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
holding
unconstitutional
a
statute
of
the
united
states
as
applied
to
nonprofit
ideological
corporations.
the
statute
in
question,
that
was
held
unconstitutional,
is
the
provision
of
the
federal
code
regulating
the
means
by
which
corporations
and
labor
organizations
participate
in
federal
elections.
the
court
found
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
it
requires
that
all
expenditures
in
connection
with
a
federal
election
be
made
from
fund
explicitly
and
voluntarily
given
for
that
purpose,
kept
separate
from
all
other
funds
of
these
organizations,
and
publicly
reported.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
fairly
straightforward.
the
corporation
in
question
is
the
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
a
non-membership
corporation
under
massachusetts
law
whose
central
purpose
is
to
foster
respect
for
human
life
and
to
defend
the
right
to
human
life,
all
human
beings,
born
and
unborn.
it
has
carried
out
its
purposes
by
raising
funds
and
contributions
which
it
uses
to
further
its
purposes
through
dissemination
of
information,
education,
and
legislation.
it
does
this
in
large
part
through
a
newsletter
which
it
distributes.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes.
the
record
seems
to
reflect
that
from
the
discussions.
after
1978
it
became
a
membership
corporation,
apparently.
the
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
in
1978,
september
of
1978,
before
the
massachusetts
primary,
distributed
an
election
flyer,
labeled
a
special
election
edition
flyer,
which
proclaimed
that
it
had
in
it
everything
you
need
to
vote
pro-life,
set
forth
the
mcfl's
positions
on
several
issues,
indicated
the
positions
in
relationship
to
some
400
candidates,
all
federal
candidates
and
state
candidates,
urged
the
recipients
to
vote
pro-life,
depicted
some
of
them
with
pictures,
those
who
supported
the
pro-life
position.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
congress
can
require
that
the
funds
used
for
such
advocacy
can
be
separate...
can
be
required
to
be
separate
and
segregated
from
the
funds
which
consist
only
of
voluntary
contributions.
the
court
below
concluded
that
the
statute
in
question
restricted
the
simplest
method
by
which
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
could
achieve
its
advocacy.
it
said
that
there
was
a
burden
on
the
rights
of
speech
and
association
because
of
the
requirement
of
establishing
the
separate
segregated
fund.
before
going
on
to
the
reasoning
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
note
explicitly
three
things
that
it
did
not
decide:
it
did
not
decide
that
the
statute
prohibited
the
speech
in
question,
but
only
that
it
burdened
it;--
it
did
not
decide
that
the
statute
prohibited
the
distribution
of
voting
records,
nor
even
that
the
statute
required
that
voting
records
be
distributed
through
the
mechanism
of
a
separate,
segregated
fund;--
and
it
did
not
prohibit
this
organization
or
any
other
similar
organization
from
distributing
in
a
newsletter
to
its
members
voting
records
which
advocated
the
election
and
the
defeat
of
candidates.
what
it
did
hold
was
that
congress
cannot
for
express
advocacy
in
elections
require
that
any
material
that
is
disseminated
to
the
general
public,
not
distributed
in
the
way
that
a
message
ordinarily
is
by
an
organization,
can
be
required
to
be
from
a
separately
segregated
fund,
from
a
fund
which
apprises
everyone
that
the
contributions
to
it
will
be
used
in
connection
with
specific
federal
elections--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--yes,
the
organization
in
making
the
solicitations...
those
can
be
done
by
the
organization,
would
be
done
by
the
organization,
and
they
would
be
the
ones
that
apprised
them
of
that.
there
are
three
policies
underlying
the
act
which
we
think
that
the
court's
decision
goes
against.
first
of
all,
if
the
court's
decision
stands
the
disclosure
aspects
of
the
act
are
substantially
undercut.
again,
there
are
really
three
purposes
put
forward
by
the
statute.
one
of
them
is
the
disclosure.
it
has
been
argued
here
that
the
section
in
question,
section
441(b),
whose
antecedent
goes
back
to
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act,
is
not
a
disclosure
statute.
it
does,
however,
specifically
set
forth
that
the
corporations'
and
labor
organizations'
separate
segregated
funds
are
political
committees
and
subjects
them
therefore
to
the
same
requirements
that
all
political
committees
are
required
under
the
federal
election
campaign
act
regarding
disclosure.
and
if
the
court's
decision
were
to
stand,
that
disclosure
of
where
money
is
spent
and
where
it
comes
from
would
be
considerably
lessened.
the
second
policy--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
think
congress
felt
that
it
would
not
do
that
and,
in
light
of
the
first
amendment,
did
not
do
that,
and
there
was
an
explicit
statutory
exception.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
requirement
to
uphold.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
because
here
the
purposes
of
the
organization
are...
again,
i
think
one
of
the
questions
here
would
be,
if
the
purpose
of
this
organization
had
been
to
distribute
newsletters
by
subscription
and
so
forth
and
that
was
its
regular
business,
that
there
would
be
that
question
there.
this,
however,
seems
to
us
crosses
over
the
line
from
the
operation
of
a
newspaper
in
that
sense
to
pure
election
advocacy,
and
that
in
that
sense
the
congress
is
balancing
there
between
two
different
issues,
one
of
those
issues
being
whether
election
advocacy
in
the
sense
of
urging
the
election
or
defeat
of
particular
individuals
can
be
financed
directly
from
a
corporation's
funds.
they
did
not
prohibit
that
speech.
they
merely
said
that
that
should
be
done
through
a
separate,
segregated
fund
and
prescribed
the
methods
for
having
that
fund
operated
and
required
the
public
disclosure.
but
again,
that
is
not
a
prohibition
of
that.
now,
whether
the
same
disclosure
for
a
newspaper...
again,
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
question
there,
but
i
think
that
it
could
be
argued
that
disclosure
of
the
sources
of
a
newspaper's
funding
was
constitutionally
permissible
so
long
as
it
involved
no
particular
restriction
on
what
the
newspaper
would
do.
laws
of
general
application,
going
back
to
the
grosjean
case
and
other
cases
of
that
applied
to
newspapers,
would
be,
could
be
upheld.
but
i
don't
think
that
question
is
here
before
the
court,
certainly
not
on
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
because
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
explicitly
found
that
this
was
not
the
operation
of
massachusetts
citizens
for
life's
newsletter.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
the
federal
election
campaign
statute
does
require,
on
ads
placed,
where
the
source
of
that
is.
that
is
not
a
direct
requirement
on
the
newspaper,
but
i
think
that
there
is
the
possibility,
again,
that
such
a
statute
could
be
upheld
as
a
disclosure
statute
as
long
as
it
did
not
limit
the
newspaper's
right
to
publish
those.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
we
do
not
think
that
is
barred
and
we
do
not
contend
that
that
is
barred.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--there's
two
differences.
one
is
that...
i
took
the
hypothetical
as
not
being
a
corporation.
assuming
that
the
hypothetical
related
to
a
corporation,
the
commission
has
explicitly
set
forth
that
if
voting
records
were
published
in
a
non-partisan
fashion
it
would
not
consider
those
to
be
in
connection
with
a
federal
election.
the
question
here,
as
the
court
below
found,
is
not
the
publication
of
such
voting
records,
but
voting
records
explicitly
combined
with
express
advocacy.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
assuming
by
that,
as
the
commission
has
set
forth
in
its
regulations,
that
they
were
non-partisan.
in
effect,
i
think
what
is
centrally
at
issue
here
with
regard
to
this
case
is
what
we
see
as
essentially
a
purpose
of
congress
in
establishing
a
prophylactic
rule
with
regard
to
particular
types
of
organizations...
corporations
and
labor
organizations.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
it
is
that
clear,
justice
o'connor.
we
have
set
forth
at
some
length,
particularly
in
our
reply
brief,
the
origins
of
this
statute
going
backwards
in
time.
and
of
course,
as
we've
said,
we
think
the
fact
that
it
is
an
80
year
old
statute
which
has
been
passed
back
and
forth
through
congress
many
times
gives
some
weight
to
it.
but
if
you
go
back
to
the
'47
debates
which
we
have
set
forth,
we
think
that
the
debates
there
and
the
eventual
results,
and
indeed
the
legislative
hearings
that
led
up
to
that
statute,
make
it
quite
clear
that
the
sponsors
of
that
act,
particularly
senator
taft,
were
focusing
on
this
question
of
all
corporations.
we
have
set
forth
in
footnotes
to
our
briefs
several
organizations
with
which
the
1946
hearings
had
been
concerned,
which
were
quite
clearly
non-profit
ideological
organizations
in
that
sense.
senator
taft
in
discussing
the
legislation
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
was
asked
numerous
questions.
a
large
number
of
those
were
set
out
in
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
cio.
a
number
of
those
clearly
relate
to
organizations.
he
spoke,
as
we've
noted,
of
churches
that
were
incorporated,
that
would
have
no
right
to
spend
the
money
of
their
members
in
that
fashion.
and
they
were
drawing,
in
that
sense,
and
senator
taft
was
drawing
in
the
discussions
a
very
precise
line
relating
to
the
existence
or
not
or
whether
it
was
a
corporation
or
a
labor
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
it
is
clear,
in
the
sense
that
that
question
was...
it
was
resolved
again
by
the
congress
after
this
court's
decision
in
buckley
versus
valeo.
there
is
different
disclosure
required,
but
that
the
statute
requires
the
disclosure
of
independent
expenditures
by
individuals
under
a
separate
section
of
the
statute,
434(c)
that
is
not
the
one
here
at
issue,
but
that
individuals
are
required
to
disclose
under
the
statute
independent
expenditures
that
they
make
exprelly
advocating
the
election
or
defeat
of
candidates.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
the
statute
in
question,
2
u.s.c.
441(b),
does
apply
to
non-profit
membership
corporations
in
our
view,
and
we
think--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--it
is
organized
under
that
section
of
the
massachusetts
law.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
no.
my
phrasing
was
meant
to
say
that
i
think
that
the
question
of
their
tax
status...
i'm
less
clear
of
their
tax
status
under
the
federal
laws.
but
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
they
are
a
non-profit
corporation.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
1907
was
the
first
passage
of
it,
yes.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
it
is.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
at
the
time
it
was
passed
that
was
certainly
so.
of
course,
the
corporate
structure
then
was
considerably
different.
as
i
said
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
i
think
it
clear
when
congress
reconsidered
the
statute
as
it
did
in
1947
when
it
added
labor
organizations
that
it
envisaged
that.
and
i
think
that
it
was
clear
again
in
1971,
when
the
statute
was
re-amended
in
light
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
cio
case
and
the
uaw
case,
that
mr.
hansen,
who
introduced
the
bill
there,
was
saying
that
the
purpose
of
that
bill
was
to
codify
the
pre-existing
understanding
of
the
law;
and
that
it
had
been
clear
throughout
that
period,
i
think,
that
congress
was
seeking
a
rule
that
dealt...
used
the
term
"corporations".
the
term
in
the
statute
is
"any
corporation
whatever".
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
is
the
question,
and
that
was
the
question--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--well,
some
of
them
do
not.
this
is
quite
a
small
one,
but
i
think
that
in
the
context
again
of
the
federal
revenue
code,
one
finds
non-profit
corporations,
particularly
the
ones
that
are
not
merely
503(c)(3)'s,
but
(c)(4)'s,
that
do
have
substantial
accumulations
of
money.
of
course,
they
are
not,
in
the
sense
of
having...
they
have
not
derived
that
capital
from
the
way
that
the
traditional
business
corporation--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--well,
i
think
that
the
concern
that
this
court
should
have
about
that
i
certainly
understand
and
concede.
what
i
think
that
the
congress
has
here
done
has
set
forth
a
rule
which
is
meant
not
to
inquire
into
every
single
transaction
or
the
nature
of
every
particular
type
of
corporation
that's
involved.
indeed,
i
think
one
of
the
difficulties,
one
of
the
outplays
from
if
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
were
to
stand,
is
that
it
seems
to
say
in
effect
that
the
commission
not
only
has
the
power,
but
the
responsibility,
for
deciding
and
inquiring
into
whether
a
particular
corporation
is
ideological,
whether
it
is
therefore
one
that
has
particular
beliefs.
and
i
see
that
as
being
a
substantially
difficult
test
as
opposed
to
a
quite
neutral,
quite
defined
by
other
laws
test,
such
as
congress
put
forth
with
the
use
of
the
terms
"corporation"
and
"labor
organizations".
mr.
charles
n.
steele
no,
i
think
it
did
shift
gears
then
in
deciding,
certainly
in
deciding
that
labor
organizations,
because
of
their
role
in
the
economic
process
and
because
of
the
way
they
had
been
treated
under
the
federal
statutes
regarding
labor
relations,
posed
a
similar
difficulty;
that
you
had
there,
particularly
you
had
members
who
would
be
joining
them
for
reasons
other
than
supporting
particular
political
candidates;
and
that
one
of
the
thrusts
of
the
statute
that
came
forward
in
'47
and
then
even
more
strongly
in
'71
was
that
in
seeking
money
for
these
funds,
that
people
had
to
be
apprised
of
the
political
nature
of
the
fund
and
had
to
be
allowed
to
realize
that,
in
the
paradigm
situation
of
the
labor
organization
which
requires
membership,
that
they
were
not
required
to
give
to
these
funds.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
think
that
the--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
think
that
the
decision
with
regard
to
membership
corporations
was
really
not
made
in
1971.
it
was
made
by
congress
in
1976,
quite
explicitly
with
regard
to
membership
corporations.
again,
there
are
many
of
them
that
are
small,
but
they
are
ones
which
have
come
under
the
corporate
statutes
of
the
states
and
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
there
are--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
think
that
many
of
them
are
small.
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
but
think
that,
again,
that
in
making
the
balance
i
would
urge
you
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
this
does
not
prohibit
those
corporations
from
engaging
in
this
kind
of
conduct.
it
says
merely
that
the
contributions
that
it
uses
for
that
cannot
be
assumed
to
have
been
given
to
the
organization
for
its
general
purposes,
cannot
be
assumed
to
have
been
given
for
the
purposes
of
supporting
political
candidates
and
doing
direct
political
advocacy.
but
it
does
allow
them
to
gather
those
funds.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
is
true.
i
think
that
the
statute
regarding
corporations
made
a
decision
with
regard
to
that
which
explicitly
protected
the
right
to
do
partisan
vote
registration
within
the
membership
organization.
and
the
commission's
regulations
again,
in
the
same
places
that
i
was
speaking
of
in
regard
to
the
voting
records,
have
set
forth
methods
for
voter
registration
and
get
out
the
vote
drives
so
that
they
will
be
conducted
in
a
non-partisan
fashion.
i
do
think
that
the
congress
has
had
over
the
years
a
very
legitimate
concern
that
registration
and
get
out
the
vote
can
be
partisan
and
can
be
manipulated
in
a
partisan
fashion.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
that
would
make
it
a
coordinated
expenditure.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
the
danger
the
congress
feared
was
that
you
could
get
large
expenditures
where
the
sources
would
be
known,
where
the
help
would
be
known,
and
even
though
there
was
no
overt
cooperation
before
that
a
rule
that
would
allow
those
kinds
of
expenditures
would
result
in
the
same
kind
of
indebtedness;
that
even
without
prior
coordination,
that
it
thought
that
a
prophylactic
rule
saying
that
expenditures
would
result
in
the
same
thing...
again,
the
taft-hartley
act
was
where
that
question
was
first
debated
very
strongly
with
regard
to
the
expenditures,
when
they
put
in
expenditures,
because
of
the
congressional
feeling
that
expenditures
serve
much
of
the
same
kind
of
role
as
contributions.
and
as
we
have
noted
in
our
brief,
those
were
not
said
to
be
or
alleged
to
be
or
said
necessary
to
be
in
any
of
this
court's
decisions
ones
that
were
coordinated;
that
the
feeling
was
that
expenditures
themselves
would
result
in
the
same
kind
of
debt.
the
same
kind
of
problem
was
potentially
there.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
the
judgment
of
congress
over
a
long
period
of
time,
particularly
with
regard
to
corporations,
has
been,
yes,
there
is
that
very
strong
danger
there.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well,
i
think
that
the
congressional
judgment
is
that
it's
not
merely
the
working
hard,
that
it
is
the
relationship
of
the
money
that
increases
that
indebtedness,
and
that
there
is
in
their
mind
a
very
similar
relationship
there
between
the
actual
contribution
under
control
and
the
expenditure
of
money
for
the
same
purposes.
and
indeed,
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
'47
legislation,
was
to
reach
that.
and
they
were
very
clear,
and
i
think
that
in
regard
to
that
that
in
this
case,
in
canvasing
the
cio
and
the
uaw
cases,
recognized
there
that
those
were
not
alleged
to
be
coordinated
expenditures,
but
that
those
were
expenditures
that
came
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
and
upheld
in
the
uaw
case
the
indictment
there.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well,
really
i
think
that
all
three,
the
three
that
i
was
going
to
mention,
come
under
i
think
the
general
heading
of
corruption,
because
i
think
what
congress
was
saying
was
that
the
voluntariness,
the
individual
choice
which
is
protected
in
the
statute,
was
clearly
an
important
policy;
in
other
words,
that
the
statute,
441(b),
makes
it
clear
that
in
soliciting
contributions
to
these
funds
that
they
have
to
apprise
them
of
the
fact
that
they
are
going
to
be
used
for
political
purposes,
"political
purposes"
there
meaning
explicit
election-related
purposes.
and
the
third,
the
third
purpose
which
i
have
touched
on,
but
not
in
that
direct
sense,
was
the
very
choice
that
congress
was
making,
i
think,
that
in
effect
that
it
was
a
prophylactic
rule,
that
it
would
use
a
term
such
as
"corporations"
and
not
seek...
a
very
neutral
term,
as
i
say...
and
not
seek
to
have
an
individualized
ascertainment
of
whether
or
not
there
was
corruption
in
a
particular
transaction,
would
not
seek
to
decide
whether
a
particular
corporation
was
threatening
to
the
process,
but
would
do
it
in
a
form
of
a
classification
that
was
as
neutral
as
possible.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
was
a
very
important
congressional
purpose.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
if
there
are
no
questions
from
the
court,
i
would
conclude
my
argument.
