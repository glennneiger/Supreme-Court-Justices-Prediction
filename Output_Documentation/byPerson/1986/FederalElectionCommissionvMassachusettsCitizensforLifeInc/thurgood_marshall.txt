justice

marshall
to
print
the
list
of
their
advertisements,
political
advertisements,
and
what
they
cost?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
an
ordinary
organization,
say
the
jim
brown
patriotic
society,
publishes
a
list
of
voting
records
of
all
of
the
congressmen,
that's
barred?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
difference
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
voting
records
themselves
is
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
this
apply
to
membership
corporations,
too?
non-profit
membership
corporations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
one
a
non-profit
membership
corporation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
then
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no...
you're
not
saying
that
they
don't
follow
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
sweeping
in
the
union,
they
also
brought
in
a
little
neighborhood
membership
club--
justice
thurgood

--in
podunk,
mississippi.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
that
will
not
wreck
the
united
states.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
most
of
them
are
small.
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
book
you
look
at,
you'll
find
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don't
you
agree
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that
think
that
to
urge
people
to
vote
is
non-partisan?
