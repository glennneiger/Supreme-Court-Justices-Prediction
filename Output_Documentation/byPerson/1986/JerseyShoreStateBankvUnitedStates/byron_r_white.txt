or
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
the
government
sue
the
taxpayer
or
the
lender
without
an
assessment?
go
right
directly
into
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
three
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is,
they
could
haul
you
into
court
without
you
ever
knowing
until
you
were
served
with
a
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
provision
about
notice
applies
across
the
board,
doesn't
it,
not
just
to
this
particular--
justice
byron
r.
white
--any
tax?
any
part
of
the
income
tax,
any
income
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say,
you
would
think
the
employer
ought
to
be
told
what
the
total
assessment
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
information
would
that
give
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
telling
the
lender,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
is
the
government
supposed
to
know
at
the
time
of
an
assessment
who
all
the
people
are
that
may
be
liable?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
employer
doesn't
comply?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
are
you
off
the
hook?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
doesn't
fill
in
the
blank.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
who
pays
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be,
wouldn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
satisfy
the
terms
of
the
notice
requirement
just
to
say,
we
have
made
an
assessment
against
the
employer
for
his
unpaid
tax
liabilities,
and
part
of
this
assessment
is
for
withholding
tax,
and
we
are
notifying
you
that
you
are
liable
for
your
proper
share
of
that
tax?
would
that
satisfy
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
to
say
that.
you
have
to
take
that
position,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
take
that
position,
because
you
wouldn't
expect
the
government
to
come
out
with
the
dollars
figure.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
bank
can't
really
protect
itself
with
its
customer,
can
it,
as
easily
as
the
government
can?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
this
is
an
ongoing
relationship,
it
happens
every
month.
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
lend
for
payroll
you
are
constantly...
it's
sort
of
a
working
capital
advance.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
don't
suppose
it's
automatic.
some
loan
officer,
isn't
he
always
in
on
it,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--even
with
a
line
of
credit,
there
can
be
some
checks
as
to
what's
the
status
of
your
withholding
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you'd
like
to
shift
that
risk
to
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
are
the
sections
you're
going
to
talk
about?
are
they
it
the
appendix
to
the
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
fine.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
petitioner
said
that
it
would
certainly
do
him
an
awful
lot
of
good
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
that
you
had
made
an
assessment
against
the
bank's
customer.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
might
want
to
stop
this
monthly
cutlay.
