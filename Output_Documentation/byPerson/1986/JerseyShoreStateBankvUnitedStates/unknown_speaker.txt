unknown
speaker
i'd
also
like
to
talk
about
exactly
what
the
issue
is
here,
because
i
think
that's
gotten
a
little
bit
confused
before
also.
petitioner
does
seem
to
be
at
least
partly
making
the
argument
that
the
statute
of
limitations
bars
the
suit
here
because
we
brought
suit
more
than
three
years
after
the
tax
return
was
filed
and
that
the
suit
is
therefore
timely
only
under
section
6502.
that
argument,
that
notice
of
assessment
is
required
to
extend
the
statute
of
limitations,
in
fact
was
not
raised
below
and
is
now
before
the
court.
i
think
the
argument
is
erroneous
even
if
it
were
to
be
raised,
and
i
hope
to
address
that
later
if
i
have
time.
but
i
think
that
the
question
that
is
before
the
court
is
whether...
is
kind
of
a
question
of
remedy.
their
claim
is
that
there
is
this
requirement
that
a
notice
of
assessment
be
sent
both
to
the
employer
and
to
the
bank,
and
that
the
failure
to
send
such
a
notice
somehow
completely
eliminates
any
possibility
of
collecting
3505
liability,
whether
or
not
it's
within
the
three
year
period,
whether
or
not
it's
within
the
six
year
period.
if
it
did
it
for
them,
i
presume
it
would
do
it
for
the
employer
as
well.
