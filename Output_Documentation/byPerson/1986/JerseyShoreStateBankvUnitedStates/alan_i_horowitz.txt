mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
make
a
couple
of
preliminary
observations
about
things
that
have
already
gone
on
in
the
argument
before
i
get
to
my
main
presentation.
first,
as
a
factual
matter,
the
district
court's
opinion
at
page
29a
of
the
appendix
reflects
that
the
petitioner
did
concede
liability
in
this
case
in
the
district
court
for
a
portion
of
the
liability
that
the
government
sought
to
collect.
and
it
also
reflects
that
that
was
liability
under
section
3505(a).
that
is,
they
concede
that
they
were
actually
paying
the
taxes
directly,
and
under
3505(a)
there
is
not
even
a
scienter
requirement
at
all,
since
congress
understood
that
if
they
were
paying
the
taxes
directly...
excuse
me...
if
they
were
paying
the
wages
directly,
they
would
certainly
know
that
withholding
taxes
were
not
being
paid.
so
that
i
think
is
undisputed,
and
i
think
there
was
just
a
little
confusion
earlier.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
if
it
did
it
for
them,
i
presume
it
would
do
it
for
the
employer
as
well.
in
fact--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it
does
not
it
for
the
employer
as
well.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
does
not,
no.
we've
cited...
they're
old
cases.
it
hasn't
come
up
very
often.
but
the
jenkins
case,
the
erie
forge
case
that
are
cited
in
our
brief,
are
cases
like
that
where
notice
of
assessment
through
oversight
was
not
sent,
and
we
brought
suit
against
the
employer.
and
the
court
said
the
notice
of
assessment
is
relevant
to
the
assessment
process,
to
the
administrative
collection
process,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
government's
right
to
collect
by
suit.
their
position
is
just,
they're
just
saying
that
failure
to
send
this
notice
somehow
completely
prevents
the
government
from
doing
other
things
that
are
unrelated.
they
might
as
well
say
that
we
can't
collect
income
tax
or
we
can't
enforce--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
if
there
were
a
notice
requirement
that
was
of
some
significance,
i
suppose
theoretically
the
surety
or
the
guarantor
could.
and
i
guess
that's
why
i'd
like
to
turn
to
what
i
think
the
case
is
about,
which
is
whether
there
is
such
a
notice
requirement
at
all,
that
it
be
given
to
the
bank.
but
i
would
say
that
i
think,
at
least
is
this
situation,
even
if
there
were,
the
correct
remedy
would
not
be
to
completely
bar
a
3505
suit.
i
think
the
cases
you're
speaking
about,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
cases
where
the
surety
would
be
able
to
show
that
it
was
somehow
prejudiced
by
the
failure
to
receive
notice,
and
that
there
was
a
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
sued.
this
case
is
really
just
a
case
of
statutory
interpretation,
where
this
court
must
divine
congressional
intent,
the
intent
reflected
in
section
6303(a).
in
our
view,
this
is
not
a
difficult
case.
petitioner's
contention
rests
on
an
effort
to
create
a
relationship
between
two
provisions
of
the
code
that
are
simply
not
closely
related.
it
wrenches
the
language
of
6303
from
its
context
and
gives
it
a
meaning
that
is
plainly
not
intended
by
congress.
moreover,
the
practical
effect
of
their
argument
is
to
completely
destroy
the
efficacy
of
section
3505.
now,
we
think
our
position
is
clearly
correct,
but
i
guess
the
only
way
to
explain
the
fact
that
we've
lost
several
times
in
the
lower
courts
is
that
i
think
the
code
provisions
here
are
somewhat
confusing.
and
so,
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me,
i'd
like
to
have
a
fairly
detailed
discussion
of
the
statutory
background
before
i
really
get
into
the
merits
of
petitioner's
contentions.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
statutes
are
set
out
at
page
50a
and
51a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
internal
revenue
code
sets
up
two
distinct
methods
of
collecting
liabilities
against
the
government.
there
is
an
administrative
collection
system
and
a
judicial
collection
system.
the
judicial
collection
system
i
don't
need
to
dwell
on.
the
government
files
a
suit
in
court
and
if
it
wins
the
suit
it
has
a
judgment
in
its
favor
and
it
could
collect.
now,
the
administrative
system
is
triggered
by
what
is
called
a
government
assessment
of
liability.
the
assessment
is
a
term
of
art,
and
that's
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
when
an
assessment
is
made,
triggering
this
administrative
system,
the
government
does
not
need
to
go
to
court
in
order
to
satisfy
its
liability.
it
can
resort
to
summary
collection
procedures,
which
involve
levying
on
the
property
of
the
taxpayer.
the
issuance
of
an
assessment
followed
by
a
demand
also
establishes
a
lien
on
the
taxpayer's
property.
and
the
only
way
the
taxpayer
can
deal
with
an
assessment,
really,
is
by
paying
the
tax
and
then
filing
the
refund
suit,
in
which
case
the
burden
is
then
on
the
taxpayer
to
prove
an
entitlement
to
a
refund.
because
of
this,
there
is
a
preference
for
the
commissioner
to
assess
in
many
cases,
because
it's
more
convenient
for
him.
on
the
other
hand,
all
liabilities
are
not
assessable.
there
are
classes
of
liabilities
where
an
assessment
cannot
be
made.
most
taxes
are
assessable,
but
the
code
also
requires
that
certain
taxes...
that
there
must
be
a
notice
of
deficiency
issued
before
the
taxes
can
be
assessed.
for
example,
if
one
files
on
income
tax
return
and
the
commissioner
determines
that
there
is
a
deficiency
in
that
return,
that
the
amount
reported
as
due
on
the
return
is
less
than
what
is
actually
owed,
and
the
commissioner
issues
a
notice
of
deficiency,
the
taxpayer
has
the
opportunity
to
contest
that
notice
in
the
tax
court
before
an
assessment
can
be
made.
now,
for
the
purposes
here
we
must
remember
that
employment
taxes
are
assessable
against
the
employer.
on
the
other
hand,
section
3505
liability
for
third
party
lenders
is
not
assessable.
the
only
way
the
government
can
collect
that
liability
is
by
bringing
a
suit.
now,
section
6303,
the
provision
at
issue
here,
is
part
of
this
assessment
process.
it's
on
page
51a,
and
it
is
triggered
by
the
making
of
an
assessment.
it
provides
that
when
an
assessment
is
made,
the
secretary
shall
within
60
days
after
making
the
assessment
of
the
tax
give
notice
to
each
person
liable
for
the
unpaid
tax,
stating
the
amount
and
demanding
payment
thereof.
now,
a
little
bit
later
i
hope
to
talk
about,
parse
the
statute
carefully,
and
discuss
petitioner's
plain
meaning
argument.
but
for
now
i
would
just
like
to
explain
how
this
fits
into
the
system.
when
an
assessment
is
made,
the
government
gives
this
notice
of
assessment
to
the
taxpayer,
who
then
is
on
notice
as
to
what
he
owes
and
what
amount
has
been
assessed
against
him.
and
there
is
also
a
demand
for
payment
of
that
amount
by
the
government.
if
the
taxpayer
refuses
to
make
that
payment,
at
that
point
the
lien
provisions
kick
in
and
the
government
is
entitled
to
levy
on
his
property.
the
purpose...
i
think
clearly
the
purpose
of
this
section...
and
i'm
not
sure
the
petitioner
would
dispute
that
this
is
the
primary
purpose,
although
he
tries
to
read
some
other
purposes
into
it
as
well...
the
purpose
is
to
give
the
taxpayer
the
opportunity
to
take
steps
to
avoid
the
summary
collection
procedures,
so
that
he
is
put
on
notice
that
these
things
are
about
to
commence.
section
3505
is
a
completely
different
animal.
it
creates
a
liability
for
third
party
lenders.
it
was
passed
by
congress
in
1966
to
address
a
specific
problem
that
they
had
discovered,
the
practice
of
net
payroll
financing.
the
way
the
system
works...
and
it's
described
in
some
detail
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
at
page
4a
and
5a.
it
was
pretty
prevalent
in
the
construction
industry.
when
a
particular
subcontractor
started
running
into
financial
difficulties,
it
would
receive
funds,
either
from
a
prime
contractor
or
from
a
lender,
to
help
it
keep
its
business
going.
but
in
order
to
limit
their
liability,
the
lenders
would
advance
funds
only
to
the
extent
of
the
net
payroll,
the
money
that
the
employer
would
actually
have
to
pay
to
the
employees.
the
money
that
the
employers
were
withholding,
at
least
on
paper,
would
not
be
advanced
by
the
lender
and
would
never
appear...
would
never
be
paid
to
the
government.
now,
this
is
the
government's
money
and
the
government
is
out
the
money
at
some
point.
for
example,
if
one
of
the
employees
has
a
significant
amount
listed
as
withholding
tax
that's
withheld
from
his
paycheck,
but
then
it
ultimately
turns
out
he
doesn't
owe
any
tax,
the
government...
he'll
file
his
tax
return
and
the
government
will
have
to
pay
a
refund
of
several
thousand
dollars
to
him.
it's
refunding
money
that
the
government
never
got,
because
no
one
ever
paid
it
in
as
withholding
tax.
so
congress
viewed
this
as
a
serious
problem,
and
the
way
it
sought
to...
well,
the
reason...
i'm
sorry,
let
me
backtrack
for
a
minute.
the
reason
congress
could
not
collect
this
money
from
the
lenders
before
was
because
the
code
only
defined,
only
gave
the
government
a
right
to
collect
it
from
employers,
and
these
lenders
were
not
employers
within
the
meaning
of
the
code.
so
they
passed
section
3505
to
give
the
government
a
direct
remedy
against
these
lenders,
and
the
statute,
which
is
set
out
at
page
50a,
has
two
sections.
it
applies
to
third
party
lenders
who
are
directly
paying
the
net
payroll.
they
are
made
subject
to
liability
in
the
amount
of
the
withholding
taxes.
and
section
3505(b)
also
extends
this
liability,
i
think
to
prevent
lenders
from
just
circumventing
this
by
going
through
a
conduit.
it
also
applies
to
lenders
who
are
making
loans
for
the
purpose
of
paying
a
payroll.
now,
the
notion
here
was
that
these
lenders
were
sitting
in
the
same
position
as
the
employers,
and
the
government
thought
it
was...
excuse
me...
congress
thought
that
it
was
reasonable
to
treat
them
the
same
as
employers
for
these
purposes
and
to
make
them
assume
liability
for
these
taxes.
the
overriding
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
make
sure
that
the
government
got
its
withholding
tax,
preferably
at
the
outset,
but
if
not
through
a
later
suit
under
section
3505.
now,
petitioner's
contention
here
is
that
it
can
escape
this
liability
that
congress
deliberately
put
upon
it,
simply
by
the
essentially
unrelated
fact
that
an
assessment
has
been
made
against
the
employer
and
that
it
did
not
receive
a
notice
of
that
assessment.
this
is
really
an
absurd
contention.
clearly,
clearly
there
is
no
entitlement
to
notice
at
all.
if
the
government
brought
suit
within
three
years,
without
making
a
notice
of
assessment,
it
could
sue
the
employer,
it
could
sue
the
lender,
without
issuing
any
notice
at
all.
so
the
purported
notice
requirement
only
arises
somehow
from
the
making
of
an
assessment
against
an
employer.
but
that
is
not
an
event
that
has
any
particular
bearing
on
the
lender.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
there
is
a
duty
to
give
notice
to
the
employer.
there
is
a
duty
to
give
notice
to
the
person
against
whom
the
tax
is
assessed.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct,
and
i'll
try
to
explain
that
in
a
minute.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
there
is
significance
in
that
language.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
lender
is
in
fact
not
covered
by
section
6303(a),
because
that
refers
only
to
persons
who
are
liable
for
the
tax.
a
lender
is
not
subject
to
the
tax;
he
is
subject
to
liability,
to
a
separate
liability
created
by
section
3505.
in
fact,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
section
3505
liability
is
not
assessable.
it
probably
would
be
assessable
if
congress
had
established
it
as
a
tax,
because
all
taxes
are
assessable.
so
this,
the
fact
that
congress
set
it
up
this
way,
redounds
to
the
benefit
of
the
lenders
because
it
immunizes
them
from
these
administrative
collection
procedures
and
requires
the
government
to
resort
to
judicial
action
in
order
to
collect
this
liability.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think...
well,
i
think...
i'm
sure
that
it
means
an
amount
equal
to
the
unpaid
tax.
i
mean,
there
is
no
provision
for
double
collection
by
the
government.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
i
thought
justice
blackmun
was
only
asking
about
the
taxes
that
are
referred
to
in
the
section.
no,
the
lender
is
liable--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--absolutely.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
well,
deducted
and
withheld
from
such
wages
by
the
employer.
well,
at
any
rate,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
statute,
what
it
does
make
the
lender
liable
for
is
withholding
taxes,
not
the
employer's
portion
of
social
security,
but
withholding
taxes,
which
means
income
tax
that
are
withheld
and
the
employee's
portion
of
social
security;
and
that
it
does
not
require
payment
of
taxes
over
and
above
what
has
already
been
paid
100
percent.
i'm
told
that
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
there
is
a
credit.
well,
i
think
there
are...
let
me
say
two
things
briefly
about
petitioner's
contention.
one,
this
notice
that
they're
asking
for
tells
them
nothing
that
they
don't
already
know.
it
doesn't
serve
any
purpose.
the
only
purpose
i
think
that
petitioner
adverted
to
in
his
argument
is
this
notion
of
extending
the
statute
of
limitations.
putting
that
aside
for
a
moment,
certainly
getting
notice
that
the
taxes
have
been
assessed
against
the
employer
doesn't
tell
the
lender
anything,
because
there
is
this
scienter
requirement
in
the
statute.
they
can
only
be
held
liable
under
section
3505
if
they
have
actual
notice
that
withholding
taxes
have
not
been
paid
by
the
employer.
and
the
amount,
as
has
been
discussed
before,
the
amount
that
is
on
the
notice
of
assessment
to
the
employer,
doesn't
mean
anything
to
the
bank.
it
doesn't
tell
it
what
its
liability
might
be.
nor
does
sending
it
at
copy
suggest
that
the
government
is
planning
to
sue
the
bank.
it
would
just
be
sending
it
a
copy.
and
the
other
serious
problem
here
is
that
the
interpretation
sought
by
petitioner
would
completely
eliminate
3505(a)
from
the
code,
because
there's
just
no
way
that
the
irs
can
know
at
the
time
it
makes
these
assessments,
which
is
usually
within
a
couple
of
months
of
the
time
the
withholding
tax
return
is
filed,
whether
there
is
a
lender,
whether
the
lender
might
arguably
be
subject
to
3505(a)
liability.
so
i
do
think
that
petitioner's
contention
here
makes
absolutely
no
sense
within
the
structure
of
the
code.
now,
given
that,
the
only
argument
that
he
has
really
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
the
argument
that
the
other
court
of
appeals
have
gone
off
on.
i
think
even
judge
weis
dissenting
here
and
some
of
the
other
courts
have
recognized
that
the
government's
position
makes
more
sense,
but
they
have
found
themselves
to
be
bound
by
the
plain
meaning.
so
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
because
i
think
even
looking
at
6303(a)
alone,
without
considering
its
impact
on
the
rest
of
the
code,
the
plain
meaning
in
fact
does
support
the
government's
reading
of
it.
first
of
all,
i
won't
dwell
on
this
because
it
came
up
quite
a
bit
earlier,
but
section
6303(a)
clearly
contemplates
the
sending
of
a
particular
kind
of
notice.
it
says:
"after
making
of
an
assessment
of
tax,
shall
give
notice
to
each
person
liable
for
the
unpaid
tax,
stating
the
amount
and
demanding
payment
thereof.
"
now,
the
notice
that
petitioner
seeks
just
doesn't
do
that.
sending
a
copy
to
the
lender
does
not
demand
payment
of
the
taxes
from
the
lender.
the
government
can't
demand
payment
of
the
taxes
from
the
lender,
because
the
lender
is
not
obligated
to
pay
those
until
we
have
brought
a
suit
and
established
its
liability
in
a
civil
proceeding.
and
it
does
not
state
the
amount
that
we
might
even
ultimately
hope
to
hold
it
liable
for.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
have
a
potential
claim
against
the
lender.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
no.
the
claim
against
the
employer...
the
employer
is
liable
right
at
that
time
to
pay
the
money
because...
this
is
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
before...
because
the
liability
has
been
assessed
against
the
employer.
that
means
we
don't
have
to
go
to
court
to
collect
from
the
employer.
that
means
that
the
levy
provisions
of
the
code
come
into
play
and
that
we
can
go
and
seize
the
employer's
car,
seize
the
employer's
assets,
if
he
doesn't
pay.
so
he
can
demand--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
not
unless
he's
paid
the
money
first.
he
has
to
pay
and
then
he
can
file
a
refund
suit.
but
this
notice
and
demand
that
is
sent
under
6303(a)
is
a
demand
for
payment
from
the
employer,
and
he
cannot
refuse
that
payment
except
at
the
pain
of
having
his
assets
levied
upon.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
i'm
not
sure
which
word
you're
asking
about.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i'm
not
talking
about
the
phrase
"liable".
i'm
talking
about
the
word
"demanding
payment
thereof",
which
i
think
is
the
type
of
notice
that
is
contemplated
by
this
section.
it
says
"a
notice
stating
the
amount
and
demanding
payment
thereof.
"
and
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
sending
this
notice
to
the
employer
does
demand
payment
of
that
money
from
the
employer.
the
employer
has
no...
has
only
to
choices:
it
can
either
pay
the
money
or
it
can
not
pay
the
money,
in
which
case
the
irs
has
the
power
to
seize
his
assets
to
satisfy
the
debt.
and
the
only
way
he
can
contest
that
liability
in
court
is
by
paying
the
money
and
then
filing
the
refund
suit.
the
bank
is
in
a
very
different
position.
sending
a
copy
of
this
to
the
bank,
even
assuming
it
had
the
right
amount
that
the
bank
might
potentially
be
liable
for,
is
not
a
demand
for
payment
from
the
bank.
we
have
no
right
to
demand
payment
from
the
bank
until
we
have
sued
them
and
established
their
liability
in
court.
so
i
do
think
that
sending
the
notice
to
the
bank
is
not
at
all
the
notice
that
is
contemplated
by
section
6303(a).
and
i
would
say
that
even...
petitioner
tries
to
litigate
this
case
by
focusing
on
the
one
phrase
in
the
statute,
"a
person
liable
for
the
unpaid
tax.
"
and
not
looking
at
the
rest
of
the
statute.
even
looking
at
that
particular
phrase,
the
plain
meaning
does
not
support
its
position.
first
of
all,
"the
unpaid
tax"
seems
to
me
pretty
clearly
to
refer
to
same
tax
that
is
referred
to
in
the
previous
sentence,
which
is
the
tax
that
has
been
assessed.
and
that
is
not
the
tax
that
the
bank
is
liable
for.
another
point
is
that,
as
i
mentioned
before
in
talking
with
justice
blackmun,
it's
not
a
tax
at
all
that
is
imposed
on
the
employer.
it
is
just
a
liability,
specially
created
by
section
3505,
and
that
is
not
a
tax.
it
is
certainly
not
the
tax
that
is
listed
in
the
notice
of
assessment
because,
as
we've
mentioned
before,
the
amounts
are
not
going
to
be
the
same.
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
why
courts
have
to
feel
compelled
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
to
reach
a
result
that
is
really
quite
absurd
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
code.
if
anything,
the
statute,
if
read
in
a
sensible
way,
i
think
reflects
its
intended
purpose,
which
is
that
when
a
liability,
tax
liability,
is
assessed
against
an
employer
or
any
other
taxpayer,
he
has
to
be
told
what
that
assessment
is
so
that
he
can
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary
to
avoid
having
his
property
levied
upon.
now,
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
statute
of
limitations
a
little
bit
because
i
think
that's
the
only
thing
that
petitioner
has
come
up
with
where
the
notice
could
conceivably
make
any
difference.
first,
there's
the
general
claim
that
there's
an
element
of
unfairness
here
because
he's
not
receiving...
the
bank
is
not
receiving
notice
of
this
extended...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
don't
think
congress
intended
the
irs
to
be
out
there
doing
the
bank's
work
for
them.
i
don't
think
there's
any
statutory
obligation
to
assist
banks
in
making
good
loans.
and
as
i
said
before,
i
don't
think
we're
telling
the
bank
anything
they
don't
already
know,
because
in
order
to
be
liable
under
3505
they
have
to
have
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
withholding
taxes
are
not
being
paid.
now,
there
is
this
statute
of
limitations
issue,
where
section
6502,
which
is
the
six
year
statute
of
limitations,
kicks
in
upon
the
making
of
an
assessment.
i
really
think
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
is
a
red
herring,
though.
there
really
is
no
unfairness
in
this
present
system,
and
there's
no
reason
for
the
bank
to
complain
about
it.
first
of
all,
it's
a
little
misleading
to
talk
about
this
as
an
extension
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
code
sets
up
two
different
statutes
of
limitations.
there
is
a
three
year
statute
of
limitations
on
assessments,
and
along
with
that
there
is
the
same
statute
of
limitations
on
suits
that
are
brought
without
assessments.
basically,
what
that
section
does
is
that
it
tells
the
president
that
it
has
to
get
its
act
together
within
three
years.
it
has
to
decide
what
the
taxpayer's
liability
is
for
its
own
purposes,
and
either
make
an
assessment
or
bring
a
suit
to
get
it
going.
then
there
is
a
second
provision,
section
6502,
which
says
that
once
an
assessment
is
made,
once
the
government
has
made
this
determination,
it
then
has
six
years
to
collect
the
liability.
now,
that's
the
way
the
system
works.
that's
the
standard
statute
of
limitations
is
six
years
after
assessment.
the
normal
course
of
business...
and
the
bank
i
don't
think
can
deny
this...
in
almost
every
case,
since
assessments
are
routinely
sent
out
when
withholding
tax
is
not
paid,
there
is
going
to
be
an
assessment
made
and
there
is
then
going
to
be
a
six
year
statute
of
limitations
on
the
collection.
that
will
apply
to
the
employer,
that
will
apply
to
the
bank.
and
there
is
no
reason
for
the
bank
to
think
that
the
statute
is
going
to
be
anything
less.
so
this
isn't
a
situation
where
the
bank
has--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
don't
think...
the
three
year
limitations
period
doesn't
directly
apply
to
the
bank.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
what
statute
of
limitations
here?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think
there's
any
statute
of
limitations
provision
that
applies
to
the
bank.
there
are
these
provisions
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--either
with
or
without
an
assessment,
that's
correct.
but
there
is...
the
bank's
liability
is
derivative
of
the
employer,
and
there
is
the
updike
case
which
was
cited
in
our
brief,
which
has
generally
taken
the
view
that
these
kinds
of
derivative
liabilities
are
subject
to
the
same
statute
of
limitations
that
is
applicable
to
the
primary
liability.
and
we
have
conceded
here
that
the
bank
therefore
has
the
right
to
the
same
statute
of
limitations
that
applies
to
the
employer.
so
i
don't
think
there
is...
if
it
weren't
for
the
updike
case,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
statute
of
limitations
that
would
apply
to
3505
actions.
i
think
they
could
be
brought
at
any
time,
even
50
years
down
the
road.
but
because
there
are
statutes
of
limitation
that
apply
to
suits
against
the
employer,
and
we've
taken
the
view
that
the
bank
is
entitled
to
the
same
statute
of
limitations,
so
therefore
filing
the
assessment
extends
the
period
against
the
employer,
and
the
same
thing
would
happen
to
the
bank.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
i
guess
one
other
point
i
should
make
on
the
statute
of
limitations
is
that
the
bank...
there's
really
no
reason
for
the
bank
to
be
thinking
of
a
three
year
statute,
aside
from
the
general
practice
of
the
irs.
if
the
bank
is
as
ignorant
of
what's
going
on
with
the
employer
as
it's
trying
to
make
itself
out
to
be,
it
wouldn't
even
know
that
the
employer
had
filed
a
withholding
tax
return.
it's
quite
possible
that
the
employer
wouldn't
file
a
return
at
all,
and
the
three
year
statute
only
runs
from
the
time
the
return
is
filed.
so
if
the
employer
doesn't
file
a
return,
there's
no
statute
of
limitations
running
at
all
at
any
time.
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
for
the
bank
to
be
sitting
here
saying
it
thinks
its
statute
of
limitations
has
expired
without
notice.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
are
two
separate
taxes
here.
there's
the
social
security
tax,
which
as
an
employee's
share
and
an
equal
employee's
share.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that,
but
i
don't
see
why
we
should
credit
it
to
the
employee's
share.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
return
would
have
to
list
both
liabilities.
so
the
return
would
list
as
tax
due
say
$20,000,
just
say
it's
$10,000
each.
the
return
would
list
$20,000
and
you're
saying
only
$10,000
is
remitted
with
the
return?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
well,
i
don't
see
why--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
then
it
would
have
a
defense
under
3505,
if
it
didn't
have
any
notice.
then
it
wouldn't
be
liable.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
case
would
qualify.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
