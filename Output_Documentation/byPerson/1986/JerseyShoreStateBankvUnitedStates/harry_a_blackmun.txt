do
i
understand
that
you
concede
liability
for
a
portion
of
that
time,
but
i
take
it
not
collectability
in
view
of
the
lack
of
notice?

mr.
horowitz,
would
you
straighten
me
out
on
one
thing.
in
3505
both
(a)
and
(b),
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
the
lender
is
responsible
for
the
tax.
it
says
that
he
is
responsible
for
a
sum
equal
to
the
taxes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
any
significance
in
that
language?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
the
situation
were
such
that
the
taxes
were
personally
paid,
that
would
be
the
lender's
liability?
the
statute
says
an
amount
equal
to
the
tax.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
isn't
even
that,
is
it?
it's
the
only
the
portion
withheld
from
the
wages
of
the
employee,
not
the
employer
contribution.
