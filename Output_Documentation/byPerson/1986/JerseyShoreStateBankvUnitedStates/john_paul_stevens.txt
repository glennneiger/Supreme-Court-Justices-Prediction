justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i.
i
didn't
quite
understand
part
of
your
response
to
justice
blackmun.
you
concede
liability
for
part
of
the
tax,
is
that
correct,
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
you
also
concede
that
you
had
actual
notice
of
the
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
how
could
you
be
liable
under
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore
it
concedes
that
it
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
deficiency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
notice...
there's
a
scienter
requirement
in
the
statute,
isn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
you
don't
concede
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
because
to
concede
liability
you've
got
to
concede
scienter,
do
you
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
so
you
don't
concede
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
colloquy
with
justice
scalia,
had
there
never
been
an
assessment
in
this
case
at
all,
would
you
claim
that
you
were
entitled...
and
say
the
government
sued
you.
so
the
employer
went
bankrupt
so
there's
no
money
around,
and
within
a
three
year
period
they
brought
an
action
against
you
under
the
statute.
would
you
contend
that
there
was
a...
that
the
statute...
that
the
claim
would
be
barred
by
the
failure
to
give
a
section
6303(a)
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
agree
that
you
could
be
sued
without
any
notice
if
there's
no
assessment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
the
unpaid
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
liable
for
the
unpaid
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
includes
the
entire
unpaid
tax,
does
it
not?
and
your
client
is
not
liable
for
the
total
unpaid
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they're
liable
for
a
sum
equal
to
a
portion
of
the
tax.
that's
not
quite
the
same
as
being
liable
for
the
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statutory
language
in
3505(a)
and
(b)
is
"a
sum
equal
to
a
portion.
"
basically
a
portion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
a
different
tax.
that's
a
different
amount
than
the
one
referred
to
in
6303.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
stop
you
here.
why
do
you
say
that?
if
the
assessment
is
irrelevant
to
the
collection
process
against
the
bank,
why
should
the
effect
of
the
assessment
on
the
statute
of
limitations
have
anything
to
do
with
the
bank
either?
why
wouldn't
the
three
year
limitation
simply
continue
to
apply?
because
you're
not
using
the
administrative
collection
proceeding
against
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
what
is
the
provision
that
you
say
applies
to
the
bank?
say
there
has
never
been
an
assessment.
what
would
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
either
with
or
without
an
assessment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
supposing
that
an
employer
had
an
obligation
to
withhold
$25,000
out
of
a
particular
payroll
period
and
remit
it
to
the
government
as
the
amount
withheld
from
wages,
then
it
had
to
pay
another
$25,000,
i
assume,
for
the
employer's
share;
is
that
how
it
works?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
confine
this
to
that
one
for
a
moment.
and
what
if
the
bank
knew
that
an
amount
equal
to
the
employee's
share
had
been
remitted
with
the
return?
would
the
government
always
credit
that
on
the
employee's
share,
or
do
they
have
the
option
to
credit
that
against
the
amount
that
the
employer
should
have
contributed
for
its
own
share?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
because
conceivably
the
bank
might
get
a
copy
of
a
return
showing
an
amount
paid
equal
to
the
only
amount
it
could
be
liable
for,
and
the
government
might
say:
no,
no,
we
apply
that
to
the
employer'
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
presumably
they
didn't
remit
at
all.
that's
how
you
generally
assess
them,
i
suppose.
or
maybe
they
didn't
file.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
might
be
situations
in
which
an
employer
might
have
thought
the
full
amount
of
the
withheld
wages
was
paid
over
and
it
might
now
be
true.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
statutory
provision
do
you
say
sets
the
limitations
period
against
the
lender?

john
paul
stevens
