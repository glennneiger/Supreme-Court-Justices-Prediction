we'll
resume

we'll
proceed
with

mr.
flayhart.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
language
of
6303(a)
doesn't
really
square
very
well
with
the
kind
of
notice
you
want
given
here.
it
says
that
it
shall
give
"notice
to
each
person
liable
for
the
unpaid
tax,
stating
the
amount.
"
and
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
amount
that
the
employer
is
liable
for
is
the
same
as
the
amount
that
the
lender
is
liable
for,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
flayhart.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
horowitz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
such
a
doctrine
is
not
unknown,
mr.
horowitz,
holding
a
surety
or
a
guarantor
liable
in
some
situations
under
the
common
law.
the
original
debtor
can
never
get
off
the
hook
just
because
of
the
failure
to
give
notice,
but
occasionally
a
surety
or
a
guarantor
can,
is
my
understanding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
the
statute
that
duty
surely
does
arise,
at
least
if
you
read
the
statute
as
written,
when
there
has
been
an
assessment
against
the
employer.
you
don't
dispute
that,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
give
notice
to
each
person
liable
for
the
unpaid
tax.
you
say
the
lender
it
this
situation
is
not
such
a
person?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
establish
the
lender's
liability
in
a
civil
proceeding,
you
certainly
have
a
claim
against
the
lender.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
your
claim
against
the
employer
is
a
potential
claim,
would
you,
until
you
have
won
a
suit
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
can
go
into
district
court,
can't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
can
go
into
district
court
if
he
disputes
his
liability,
can't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horowitz--
mr.
flayhart,
do
you
have
anything
more
to
say?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
flayhart.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
the
no.
85-1736,
jersey
shore
state
bank
versus
united
states.
this
case
involves
the
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
requires
an
employer
to
withhold
income
and
social
security
taxes
from
the
wages
of
its
employees
and
to
pay
over
those
taxes
to
the
government,
but
in
some
instances,
a
person
other
than
the
employers
such
as
one
who
lends
money
to
the
employer,
may
indirectly
or
directly
pay
the
employees
wages.
if
the
taxes
required
to
be
withheld
from
the
employees
wages
are
not
paid,
the
statute
makes
such
a
lender
liable
for
a
sum
equal
to
the
unpaid
taxes.
in
this
case,
the
government
brought
suit
against
the
jersey
shore
state
bank
which
is
located
in
central
pennsylvania,
alleging
that
jersey
shore
was
a
lender
liable
for
amounts
reflecting
unpaid
withholding
taxes
owned
by
the
employer.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
bank.
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
bank
was
liable
to
the
government.
as
explained
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today,
we
agree
with
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
notice
requirement
of
the
internal
revenue
code
to
apply
where
the
government
seeks
to
collect
unpaid
withholding
taxes
from
a
third
party
lender.
so,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.
