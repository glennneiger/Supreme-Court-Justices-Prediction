mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
lender
is
entitled
to
notice
pursuant
to
section
6303(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
an
assessment
which
has
been
made
against
an
employer
for
unpaid
income
withholding
taxes
in
federal
insurance
contribution
act,
or
fica,
taxes
in
order
for
the
government
to
obtain
judgment
against
a
third
party
lender
for
these
taxes
on
a
derivative
basis
under
section
3505
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
as
noted
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
recent
case
of
messina
builders,
this
issue
has
left
the
court
of
appeals
in
disarray.
to
date,
the
seventh,
eighth,
and
eleventh
circuits
court
of
appeals
have
decided
that
notice
must
be
provided
to
a
lender,
and
the
third
and
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
have
decided
that
no
such
notice
is
required.
very
briefly,
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
beginning
in
1976
jersey
shore
entered
into
a
commercial
lending
relationship
with
a
corporation
known
as
pennmount
industries,
incorporated.
subsequent
to
entering
into
that
commercial
relationship,
in
which
jersey
shore
advanced
funds
which
were
secured
by
mortgages
and
accounts
receivable,
pennmount
industries
became
delinquent
from
the
fourth
quarter
of
1977
through
the
first
quarter
of
1980
with
regard
to
paying
to
the
government
its
employee
withholding
taxes
which
it
had
withheld.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
that
is
correct.
for
the
period
of
time
from
january
of
1979
through
march
of
1980,
we
would
concede
that
the
bank
would
otherwise
be
liable
for
the
taxes
except
for
the
issue
of
notice,
which
of
course
applies
across
the
board
to
the
entire
liability
in
this
case.
and
of
course,
if
that
were
the
only
section...
portion
of
taxes
that
the
government
were
seeking
to
collect,
we
really
wouldn't
be
here
today.
but
the
issue
which
is
before
the
court
applies
across
the
board.
the
principle
remains
the
same.
on
december
the
30th,
1983,
approximately
six
years
after
the
first
tax
liability
of
pennmount
arose,
the
government
filed
suit
against
jersey
shore
to
collect
the--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--during
the
period
of
time
from
january
of
1979
through
march
of
1980.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
no,
we
do
not
concede
that.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
well,
if
i
could
rephrase
my
answer
perhaps
just
to
clarify.
with
regard
to...
the
statute
provides
under
section
6303(a)
that
the
government
is
required
to
furnish
notice
to
each
person
liable
for
the
tax
once
an
assessment
has
been
made.
for
the
purpose
of
considering
the
notice
issue
under
the
6303(a),
we
believe
that
in
a
procedural
framework
that
the
bank
must
be
considered
to
be
a
person
liable
for
the
tax
and
therefore--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--no,
i
don't
mean
to
say--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--yes,
there
is.
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
we
concede
the
issue
as
to
the
ultimate
liability
under
the
statute,
and
i'm
sorry
if
i--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--all
right,
yes,
we
don't,
in
that
limited
context.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
under
6303(a),
yes.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
no,
we
do
not.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
we
don't
concede
anything.
we'll
start
off
on
that
basis.
the
government
admits
that
no
notice
was
provided
and
asserts
that
none
was
required
to
be
given
under
section
6303(a).
to
begin
my
discussion,
i
would
like
to
address
my
remarks
to
the
function
which
the
furnishing
of
notice
provides
to
a
lender
and
then
examine
briefly
the
plain
statutory
language
of
section
6303(a).
it
should
be
noted
that
furnishing
of
notice
to
a
lender
is
not
simply
a
formalistic
requirement
which
is
devoid
of
substance.
once
an
assessment
has
been
made
against
an
employer
within
the
three
year
period
of
time
for
bringing
assessments
under
section
6501,
then
the
statute
of
limitations
is
correspondingly
extended
for
an
additional
six
year
period
of
time
under
section
6502.
not
only
is
the
statute
extended
against
the
employer,
but
it
is
also
extended
against
the
lender
as
well.
in
the
present
context,
the
employer
receives
notice
under
section
6303(a)
and
the
lender
does
not.
having
the
benefit
of
this
extended
period
of
time,
up
to
nine
years,
there
is
an
inherent
prejudice
which
results
in
the
failure
of
the
government
to
provide
notice
to
the
lender.
in
the
nine
year
interval,
the
following
may
happen:
personnel
records...
personnel
changes
can
be
made
on
the
part
of
the
lender;
records
can
be
lost.
the
opportunity
to
mitigate
damages
is
eliminated
by
stopping
the
flow
of
the
tax
liability.
and
there
will
indeed
in--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--without
an
assessment
having
been
made
at
all,
they
can
do
it
within
a
three
year
period
of
time.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
three
years,
that's
right.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
within
that
three
year
period,
yes.
of
course,
this
is
not
the
case
in
our
instance.
it's
six
years
down
the
road.
during
this
interval,
a
maximum
of
nine
years,
there
is
lost
the
opportunity
of
stopping
funds
to
prevent
the
tax
liability
from
accruing.
in
addition,
in
many
of
these
instances
you
will
have
the
corporate
employer
who
has
gone
bankrupt
and
there
will
be
selective
recollection
on
the
part
of
the
corporate
officers.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
concluded
my
remarks
this
morning
with
a
discussion
of
the
function
that
notice
would
provide
if
timely
given
to
a
lender.
under
the
present
practice,
an
employer
who
is
clearly
liable
for
the
tax
receives
greater
procedural
protection
than
the
lender
does,
inasmuch
as
the
lender
receives
no
notice
and
yet
is
subject
to
being
sued
by
the
government
for
collection
of
the
tax
for
nine
years
after
the
employer's
liability
for
the
tax
arose.
the
majority
opinion
of
the
third
circuit--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--that's
right.
but
if
the...
once
the
employers
files
his
tax
return,
he
files
it
and
says,
i
owe
x
dollars
of
tax,
the
government
then
either
can
sue
him
within
a
three
year
period
of
time
without
having
furnished
the
assessment--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--that's
correct.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
no,
your
honor.
if
i
can
explain,
we
are
not
here
asking
any
different
statute
of
limitations
period
from
what
the
employer
receives.
if
the
government
had
brought
suit
against
jersey
shore
within
three
years
of
the
employer's
tax
liability
having
arisen,
we
would
not
contest
that
fact.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
once
the
assessment
has
been
been,
then
that
triggers
the
notice
provision
under
section
6303(a),
which
must
be
given
to
each
person
liable
for
the
tax.
that
person
would
be
the
employer
and
the
lender
as
well.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
we
are
making
the
argument
that
we
had
not
received
notice.
but
in
order
for
the
statute
of
limitations
to
be
extended,
the
precondition
of
that
is
that
notice
having
been
given.
we
were
arguing
the
fact
that
we
had
received
no
notice
and
therefore
the
government
was
precluded
from
bringing
suit
against
us.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
we
argued
it
in
regard
to
the
issue
of
notice,
which
was
a
precondition
for
the
institution
of
suit.
we
did
not
argue
the
statute
of
limitations
in
terms
of
the
bringing
of
the
suit
within
a
six
year
period
of
time,
because
we
are
not
really
questioning
that.
as
i
say,
we
are
not
requesting
a
different
statute
of
limitations
period
than
would
be
applicable
to
the
employer.
the
employer
is
entitled
to
notice.
if
the
employer
had
not
received
notice
after
the
assessment
had
been
made,
then
the
government
likewise
would
be
precluded
from
suing
the
employer
as
well.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
no.
after
it
makes
the
assessment
and
doesn't
give
the
notice
within
the
60
days
required
by
the
statute.
that's
the
prerequisite
for
then
commencing
with
the
suit.
we
are
not
requesting
a
different
period
of
time
than
what
the
employer
receives.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
without
having
provided--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--well,
that's
under
section
6303(a),
and
that
of
course
is
the
issue
which
is
before
the
court.
the
third
circuit
in
the
majority
opinion
here
seemed
to
justify
the
lack
of
notice
to
the
lender
on
the
basis
that
on
the
substantive
grounds
that
actual
notice
or
knowledge
under
section
3505
of
the
code
was
required
to
be
shown
on
the
part
of...
by
the
government,
in
order
to
foist
liability
on
the
lender
for
this
tax.
however,
as
the
eight
circuit
in
messena
builders--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--if
there
had
been
no
assessment,
no.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
within
a
three
year
period
of
time,
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
nor
beyond
that,
although
for
the
purposes
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
of
course,
all
of
the
period
of
time
that
the
government
seeks
to
impose
liability
on
the
bank
would
be
beyond
the
three
year
period
of
time,
although
i
understand
your
point
as
far
as
the
notice.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
yes,
we
do,
because
of
the
issue
of
the
notice.
in
other
words,
the
notice
is
crucial
to
this,
the
entire
issue.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
well,
not
to
belabor
the
point,
but
the
reason
that
we
didn't
is
because
we
are
not
requesting
any
different
period
of
statute
of
limitations.
we're
not
trying
to
say
that
we
ought
to...
you
see,
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
hunter
engineers
went
off
on
this
point,
and
i
think
mistakenly
so,
saying
that
the
lenders
were
really
coming
in
and
saying,
well,
the
government
would
be
forced
to
institute
a
suit
against
the
lender
within
a
three
year
period
of
time.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
no,
we
didn't
raise
it
in
that
context,
no.
we
raised
it
in
the
context
of
the
notice
issue.
the
third
circuit,
however,
in
its
majority
opinion
seemed
to
justify
this
differing
treatment
that's
being
afforded
to
a
lender
as
opposed
to
an
employer
on
the
basis
of
the
notice
requirement
contained
in
section
3505
itself.
in
other
words,
the
third
circuit
said
that
a
lender
cannot
be
held
liable
unless
the
government
can
prove
actual
notice
or
knowledge
that
the
employer
had
not
paid
its
employee
withholding
taxes
or
that
the
funds
were
supplied
by
the
lender
to
the
employer
with
knowledge
that
the
employer
would
not
pay
those
taxes.
however,
this
distinction,
as
noted
by
the
messina
builders
case
in
the
eighth
circuit,
is
inapplicable
because
of
the
fact
that
actual
notice
or
knowledge
under
section
3505
is
a
defined
term
which
includes
within
it
the
definition
contained
in
section
6323
of
the
code,
which
can
indeed
mean
lack
of
due
diligence.
therefore,
a
lender
can
be
held
liable
under
section
3505(b)
not
only
on
the
basis
of
actual
notice
or
knowledge,
but
on
the
basis
that
the
lender
failed
to
exercise
due
diligence
with
regard
to
ascertaining
the
fact
that
the
employee
taxes
had
not
been
paid.
with
regard
to
the
legislative
history
of
section
3505,
there
is
nothing
to
show
in
that
history
or
the
congressional
reports
that
congress
in
creating
a
new
class
of
persons
who
were
liable
for
this
tax
on
a
derivative
basis,
that
is
to
say
lenders,
intended
to
exempt
the
government
from
providing
the
notice
required
under
section
6303(a)
to
persons
liable
for
the
tax.
it
must
be
presumed,
we
would
urge,
that
congress
does
not
legislate
in
a
vacuum.
if
congress
had
intended
to
place
an
exemption
for
section
6303
notice
and
had
intended
to
afford
the
government
the
right
to
that
exemption,
then
it
would
have
changed
the
statute.
it
did
not
do
so
and
the
statute
remains
under
section
6303(a)
that
each
person
liable
for
the
tax
is
entitled
to
notice.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
that
is
the
unpaid
employee
withholding
tax
and
the
federal
contribution
insurance
act
taxes,
which
had
not
been
paid
by
the
employer.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
yes,
it
applies
to
each
person
liable
for
the
tax.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
that's
my
understanding,
yes,
it
would.
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
of
course,
it's--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--yes,
we
would.
now,
i
wouldn't
just--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--you
mean
the
lender
receiving--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--okay.
we
would
suggest
that...
the
government
has
made
the
argument
that
such
notice,
one,
would
not
serve
any
function,
because
supposedly
the
lender
is
already
somehow
on
notice,
that
it
must
know
that
it
has
supplied
funds.
however,
i
think
that's
why
we
make
the
argument
in
terms
of
the
actual
notice
or
knowledge
being
a
defined
term
within
section
6323,
which
can
include
lack
of
due
diligence
on
the
part
of
the
lender.
notice
that
would
be
given
to
a
lender
of
the
employer's
tax
liability
that
the
government
intends
to
seek
from
the
lender
would
allow
the
lender
to
evaluate
its
ongoing
relationship
with
its
employer-borrower
and
make
a
determination,
one,
either
to
monitor
the
funds
more
closely
to
make
sure
that
the
taxes
were
paid,
or
two,
to
stop
the
flow
of
money
entirely,
which
of
course
would
have
the
effect
of
limiting
the
tax
liability,
which
in
essence
is--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--the
government
makes
this
argument,
that
at
present
it
has
no
way
of
knowing
that.
we
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
for
the
government
to
modify
its.941
withholding
tax
forms
that
the
employer
sends
in.
under
section
6011,
the
government
is
empowered
to
authorize
or
to
make
whatever
forms
are
necessary
for
the
liabilities
of
taxpayers
to
be
reported.
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
for
the
government
to
modify
an
employer's
tax
form
to
have
a
line
item
to
say,
if
any
money
is
being
furnished
to
you
for
payroll
from
a
lender,
please
list
the
lenders
who
are
furnishing
such
payroll
money.
and
in
that
event,
when
the
employer
files
the
return
and
says
that
he
doesn't...
acknowledges
liability
for
the
tax,
but
doesn't
forward
the
tax,
the
government
then...
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
for
the
government
to
notify
those
lenders.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
well,
this
gets
back
to
the--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--i
think
that
if
the
employer
engages
in
fraud,
which
i
think
for
the
general
purpose--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--well
then,
i
think
he
would
be
engaging
in
a
fraudulent
tax
return
in
that
instance.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
well,
at
that
point
i
think
it
would
still
be
the
government's
responsibility,
because
of
the
statutory
requirement.
if
congress
wanted
to
rewrite
the
statute,
then
it
could
do
so
to
take
care
of
that
situation.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
that's
right,
there
could
be
a
difference.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
it
quite
probably
could
be
that
situation,
because
the
employer's
liability
will
also
include
an
assessment
for
the
amount
of
the
employer's
contribution
towards
social
security
contributions.
however,
that
being
said,
we
would
envision
a
notice
which
would
say
something
to
the
effect
that
you...
and
it
would
be
directed
to
the
lender...
are
hereby
notified
that
an
assessment
of
x
dollars
has
been
been
made
against
widget
corporation
for
unpaid
withholding
taxes
which
are
now
due
and
owing;
your
liability
for
these
taxes
as
a
lender
is
set
forth
under
section
6305
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
copy
of
which
is
attached
to
this
notice.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
well,
if
you
put
in
the
amount
of
the
dollars.
you
are
hereby
notified
that
an
assessment
of
$50,000
has
been
made.
it
will
not
state
the
amount
of
the
lender's
liability.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
that
is
right.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
the
type
of
notice
that
we
are
envisioning,
though,
would
serve
the
purpose,
we
believe,
of
placing
the
lender
on
notice
that
under
3505
the
government
intends
to
seek
that
liability.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
we
would
urge
that,
if
in
fact
the
government
feels
that
it
could
not
give
a
precise
indication
of
the
liability,
that
the
notice
function
as
we
have
discussed
is
still
worthwhile,
and
that
the
notice
that
can
be
contained
under
section
6303(a)
would
still
provide
the
basic
function
of
putting
the
lender
on
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
government
intends
to
seek
a
liability.
after
all,
section
6303(a)
does
not
say
that
notice
will
be
given
to
each
person
against
whom
an
assessment
has
been
made.
it
says
notice
will
be
given
to
each
person
liable
for
the
tax.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
pardon?
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
unpaid
tax.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
that
is
correct.
it
is
a
portion
of
the
liability.
there's
no
argument
with
regard
to
that
factor.
however,
the
government
clearly
believes
that
the
lender
is
a
person
liable
for
the
tax,
and
if
the
lender
is
a
person
liable
for
the
tax
then
the
question
begins,
which
was
raised
by
judge
weis
in
his
dissenting
opinion--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--well,
it
says
that
notice
of
assessment--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--under
3505(a)
it
is
the
amount
equal
to
the
unpaid
tax
liability
for
funds
which
are
advanced
directly,
ad
under
3505(b)
congress
has
placed
the
limitation
with
regard
to
25
percent
of
those
funds
in
the
enumerated
situations.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
i
think
it
would,
really.
and
i
say
that
by
simply
saying
that
you
could
have
this
type
of
notice
notifying--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--excuse
me?
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
not
necessarily,
no.
it
would
change,
although
we
are
not
so
sure
that
the
duty
is
still
not
imposed
on
the
government
by
the
statute.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
well,
it
would
be
an
assessment.
the
president
makes
the
statement
against
the
employer
and
then
sends
the
notice
on
the
amount
of
the
assessment
for
the
unpaid
tax,
which
could
be
less
than
what
the...
assuming
the
employer
pays
a
portion
of
the
tax
and
doesn't
remit
the
balance,
why,
it
would
be
a
different
figure,
that's
right.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
we
are
not
here
today
requesting
that
this
court
judicially
craft
a
notice
requirement
by
imputation
into
the
code.
the
language
of
section
6303(a)
plainly
requires
notice
of
this
tax
to
be
given
to
each
person
liable
for
the
tax,
of
which
the
lender
is
one
such
person.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
emphasize
that
the
government
contends
not
only
that
it
has
no
obligation
for
furnishing
notice
to
a
lender
under
section
6303(a)
in
order
for
the
statute
of
limitations
to
be
extended,
it
contends
that
it
has
no
obligation
for
furnishing
notice
to
anyone,
including
the
employer,
in
order
for
the
extended
statute
under
section
6501
and
section
6502.
so
our
position
is
that
the
government
basically
is
attempting
to
write
section
6303(a)
out
of
the
code
entirely,
while
at
the
same
time
having
the
benefit
of
the
extended
period
of
time
for
bringing
suit
under
section
6502.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
we're
saying,
yes,
under
6303(a)
that
the
filing
of
the
assessment
triggers
the
notice
provision.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
if
the
corollary
as
far
as
the
facts
of
our
case
are
concerned,
that
in
this
instance
the
government
wishes
to
go
beyond
the
three
year
period
without
giving
the
notice--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--at
the
moment
i
cannot
think
of
a
case.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
yes.
lastly,
the
government
urges
that
it
has
a
common
law
right
to
bring
suit
that
exists
independent
of
the
statute.
the
government
argues
that
it
has
a
right
to
sue
on
the
tax
based
as
a
debt.
both
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuits
have
considered
this
issue
and
rejected
the
claim.
clearly,
the
tax
imposed
under
section
3505
creates
a
derivative
liability
on
the
part
of
the
lender
which
is
unknown
at
common
law.
for
such
tax
to
be
imposed,
we
would
therefore
urge
that
there
must
be
compliance
with
all
elements
of
the
statute
in
creating
the
liability
on
the
part
of
the
lender.
one
of
those
statutory
elements
which
must
be
complied
with
is
subtitle
f
notice
under
section
6303(a).
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
wish
to
reserve--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--well,
the
government
makes
the
argument
that
the
bank
could
have
the
employer
execute,
i
believe--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--it
does
happen
perhaps
on
every
month.
but
again,
it's
the
issue--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--in
some
cases
it
could
be.
in
other
cases
it
could
be
a
line
of
credit
extension
just
that's
available
on
an
ongoing
basis.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
but
that
could
be
drawn
down.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
that's
a
possibility.
but
again,
you'd
have
the
same
argument
as
to
whether
the
employer
is
going
to
be
truthfully
responding
to
that
as
well.
and
we
would
suggest
that
if
the
government--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--we
think
the
risk
is
already
there.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
wish
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
we
would
just
like
to
address
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
is
that
counsel
for
the
government
seems
to
indicate
that
the
notice
that
is
given
to
the
employer
of
the
assessment,
that
we
would
urge
to
be
given
to
the
lender,
doesn't
tell
the
lender
already
something
that
it
doesn't
know.
well,
of
course
the
first
response
to
that
is,
well,
what
does
the
notice
tell
the
employer?
certainly
the
employer
already
knows
that
he's
liable
for
the
tax
because
he's
filed
the
return
and
indicates
that
he
owes
the
money.
secondly--
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
--that's
right,
and
that
the
tax
is
due
and
the
government
agent's
going
to
be
there
within
a
period
of
time.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
except
for
the
fact
that
it
also
tells
the
lender
that
the
government's
going
to
be
there
up
to
nine
years
later,
about
to
do
likewise
in
terms
of
foisting
liability
on
the
lender
for
these
same
taxes.
the
employer
gets
the
notice,
the
lender
doesn't.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
well,
we
wouldn't
quibble
with
that.
i
mean,
i
think
the
point
is
that
it's
useful
to
both
parties
and
therefore
is
required
to
be
given
to
both
parties.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
it
would
be
6501
and
6502.
mr.
martin
a.
flayhart
yes.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
from
the
court,
i
conclude
my
presentation.
