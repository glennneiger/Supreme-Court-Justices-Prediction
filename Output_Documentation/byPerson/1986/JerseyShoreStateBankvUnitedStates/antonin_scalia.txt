excuse
me.
the
employer
doesn't
necessarily
receive
any
notice
either
if
the
tax
isn't
assessed.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
he
has
no
notice.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
arguing
here
that
you
want
notice
before
you
can
be
sued.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
right
here
you're
making
a
statute
of
limitations
argument.
but
i
don't
regard
you
to
have
made
that
below.
were
you
making
a
statute
of
limitations
argument,
or
simply
the
argument
that
you
are
not
liable
for
the
tax,
period,
because
you
had
not
been
assessed?
i
thought
it
was
the
latter...
or
had
not
received
notice.
justice
antonin
scalia
precluded
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations
or
just
because
you
weren't
liable?
did
you
argue
the
statute
of
limitations
point
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
after
three
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see
what
you're
saying.
you're
saying
that,
even
against
the
employer,
once
you
make
an
assessment
you
have
to
give
notice
even
though
you
could
have
proceeded
against
the
employer
without
making
an
assessment?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
bring
a
lawsuit.
if
you
do
make
an
assessment,
you
can't
bring
suit
at
all,
even
within
the
three
years--
justice
antonin
scalia
--without
having
provided
notice.
why
would
that
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
that
since
there
was
an
assessment
you
cannot
be
sued,
neither
within
the
three
year
period
of
time
nor,
of
course,
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
that.
do
you
think
that
you
have
adequately
preserved
the
further
point,
whether,
even
though
without
the
giving
of
notice
you
could
have
been
sued
within
the
three
year
period,
you
cannot
be
sued
beyond
the
three
year
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
notice
is
crucial,
but
you
never
did
say
the
magic
words,
statute
of
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
you
did
not
raise
the
statute
of
limitations
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
state
the
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
lender's
liability.
but
you're
arguing
that
this
statute
refers
to
liability
of
the
lender.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
does
refer
to
liability
of
the
lender,
the
amount
in
question
has
to
be
the
amount
of
the
lender's
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
doubt
it
would
do
a
whole
lot
of
good
for
the
lender.
but
i'm
just
saying
it's
hard
to
see
that
this
statute
addresses
it.
it
might
be
a
very
good
idea.
i'm
just
saying
you
haven't
yet
told
us
how
the
government
can
possibly
state
the
amount
of
the
liability
of
the
lender,
and
if
it
can't
then
one
is
not
inclined
to
think
that
this
section
is
meant
to
address
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
it
did
that
with
the
employer,
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
you
could
satisfy
6303(a)
by
writing
such
a
letter
to
the
employer
saying,
you
know,
we
have
checked
our
records
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you've
paid
the
right
amount
of
tax,
we
hereby
give
you
notice
of
tax
deficiency.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
statute
of
limitations
position,
that
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
sue
beyond
three
years
unless
they
have
given
notice.
but
you're
saying
more
than
that.
you're
saying
they
can't
sue
at
all,
even
during
the
three
years,
unless
they
have
given
notice.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can't
make
the
argument
that
you've
just
made,
that
it's
not
fair
for
them
to
be
able
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
supplemental
three
years.
you're
saying
they
don't
even
have
the
benefit
of
the
three
years,
which
they
do
against
the
employer
himself
whether
or
not
they've
even
made
an
assessment.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
cases
involving
assessment
against
an
employer
in
which
an
assessment
has
been
made,
but
notice
has
not
been
given,
and
the
employer
is
held
therefore
not
subject
to
suit
even
within
the
three
year
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
the
principle
that
you're
arguing
be
applied
to
your
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
does
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
liability
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
says
"taxes
which
are
not
paid
over
to
the
united
states
by
such
employer.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
the
word
"liable"
could
mean
that,
but
it
could
mean
the
other.
it
could
also
mean
what
the
chief
justice
suggested.
are
you
saying
that
whenever
it's
used
in
the
code
it
has
that
narrower
meaning,
that
it
is
not
just
a
claim
that
remains
ultimately
to
be
determined
in
court
or
by
some
tribunal,
but
rather
it
means
an
unqualified
obligation
here
and
now
to
pay?
that's
a
very
unusual
meaning
of
that
word.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
phrase
"liable".
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
notice
of
assessment
had
not
been
given
to
the
employer?
would
you
acknowledge
that
then
suit
could
not
have
been
brought
after
three
years
against
either
the
employer
or
the
bank?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
tells
him
that
the
government's
about
to
come
and
garnish
his...
you
know,
attach
his
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
up
to
that
amount.
that's
something
important
for
him
to
know.
the
lender
doesn't
have
to
know
that,
because
it
can't
happen
to
the
lender.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
point.
that
shows
why
it
would
be
useful
to
the
lender,
but
it
doesn't
show
that
it
would
be
useful
to
the
lender
for
the
same
reason
that
it
would
be
useful
to
the
employer.
