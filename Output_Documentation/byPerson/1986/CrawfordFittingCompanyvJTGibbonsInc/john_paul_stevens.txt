justice
stevens
but
why
is
that
different
from,
say,
the
only
eyewitness
to
the
case.
sometimes
you
can't
decide
the
case
without
the
testimony
of
the
eyewitness.
justice
stevens
that's
just
because
that
happened
to
be
the
issue
of
fact
in
the
case.
justice
stevens
but
would
the
rule
be
any
different
than,
say,
the
only
witness
in
the
case
lived
in
south
america,
and
you
had
to
fly
him
up
here
to
testify
to
what
he
saw
three
years
ago?
same
rule,
you'd
also
say
he's
also
entitled
to
all
the
extraordinary
expenses?
justice
stevens
why
not?
justice
stevens
well,
all
i'm
asking
is,
your
argument
it
seems
to
me
doesn't
necessarily
apply
just
to
expert
witness
fees.
justice
stevens
it
applies
to
anything
you
really
need
to
win
your
lawsuit.
justice
stevens
how
about
extraordinary
travel
expenses
account?
say
your
only
lawyer
who
is
really
an
expert
in
this
field
lives
in
pascagoula,
mississippi,
so
you
have
to
fly
him
to
san
francisco
to
try
the
case.
and
he
gets
weekend
travel
expenses.
i
suppose
they
would
be
necessary.
justice
stevens
don't
the
lawyers
help
the
court?
justice
stevens
you
talk
about
inherent
traditional
power.
how
often
in
your
experience
have
trial
courts
allowed
expert
witness
fees
as
costs?
justice
stevens
referring
to
your
deposition
cost,
isn't
it
possible
to
read
farmer
as
saying
that
the
discretion
that
was
awarded
to
the
trial
judge
was
to
deny
excessive
deposition
costs,
such
as
daily
transcript
and
things
like
that;
that
that's
the
scope
of
the
discretion
is,
within
the
area
of
allowable
costs,
sometimes
are
excessive,
and
there's
discretion
to
cut
back.
justice
stevens
and
clearly
they
do
have
discretion
to
do
that?
justice
stevens
whether
they
have
discretion
to
allow
costs
not
authorized
by
statute?
justice
stevens
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
block,
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question?
this
case
was
tried
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
did
you
try
it?
justice
stevens
did
seattle
counsel
try
it?
justice
stevens
and
your
opponent
was
a
cleveland
lawyer,
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
none
of
them
were
members
of
the
bar
down
there,
i
guess?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
well,
there's
another
choice.
sometimes
a
plaintiff
recovers
a
monetary
award.
say
you
have
a
big
class
action,
a
lot
of
back
pay,
then
the
plaintiff
can
pay
the
fee.
that's
a
possibility
in
some
cases.
justice
stevens
--i
thought
your
argument
was
that
they
were
the
costs
as
between
solicitor
and
client;
that
they
were
part
of
cost,
not
part
of
fees.
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
argument.
justice
stevens
but
it
is
important
to
me
in
trying
to
understand
the
statute.
your
view
is
that
the
expert
witness
fees
are
allowable
as
part
of
attorney's
fees,
rather
than
as
part
of
costs?
justice
stevens
so
you
would
include
in
that,
too,
then,
just
to
make
it
clear,
extraordinary
travel
expenses.
if
you
employ
a
seattle
lawyer
to
try
the
case
in
louisiana,
travelling
back
and
forth
is
just
part
of
the
costs;
part
of
the
fees.
justice
stevens
well,
once
again,
whatever
is
in,
is
in
only
for
the
plaintiff.
so
we
really
don't
have
to
worry
about
what's
in
here,
because
here
you
have
the
defendant--
