mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
conclusion
of
a
long
and
complicated
antitrust
case,
and
after
a
hearing,
judge
palmeiri,
who
rendered
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
defendants,
granted
an
application
for
court
costs,
which
included
a
request
for
fees
involving
three
experts
who
testified
at
the
time
of
trial
on
behalf
of
the
defendant,
yes,
justice
white.
the...
judge
palmieri
approved
those
costs
in
two
situations,
he...
dr.
robers'
fees
were
allowed,
and
dr.
saving's
fees
were
allowed.
he
disallowed
the
fees
of
james
baldwin,
a
partner
with
the
accounting
firm
of
ernst
&
whinney.
the
basis
of
the
allowance
of
the
fees
were
that
these
experts
materially
enabled
the
court
to
arrive
at
the
decision
the
court
ultimately
arrived
at,
that
is,
that
the
merits
of
the
complaint
were
meritless;
that
the
circuit
court
adopted
the
opinions
of
these
two
experts;
and
that
under
54(d)
he
had
the
discretion
to
allow
the
fees.
in
an
en
banc
opinion,
the
circuit
court
reversed.
the
circuit
court
based
that
reversal
on
the
alyeska
case.
the
alyeska
case,
as
this
court
is
aware,
involved
attorneys'
fees.
and
basically
what
the
circuit
court
did
was,
it
said
that
attorneys'
fees
and
expert
fees
are
similar
or
the
same,
and
the
same
rule
ought
to
apply.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
material
distinction
between
attorneys'
fees
and
experts'
fees.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
basis
of
granting
experts'
fees
is
entirely
different
than
obviating
the
american
rule
on
attorneys'
fees.
historically,
the
role
of
an
expert
was
to
assist
the
court
and/or
the
trier
of
facts
to
arrive
at
an
appropriate
conclusion.
historically,
under
our
system
of
jurisprudence,
the
role
of
an
attorney
is
to
be
an
advocate
on
behalf
of
his
client.
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
those
two
roles
are
entirely
different--
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
--no,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
alyeska
case
did
not
permit
them
to
grant
fees
which
did
not...
which
were
not
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
and
what
they
did
was,
they
followed
that
district
which
decided
that
1920
was
exclusive,
rather
than
those
districts
which
have
indicated
that
the
adoption
of
54(d)
gave
to
the
courts...
or
i
would
prefer
to
say,
underscored
to
the
courts...
that
discretion
which
the
equity
courts
have
always
had
historically.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
that's
correct.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
that's
correct.
but
what
the
en
banc
court
did
was,
they
took
alyeska...
and
i
think
that's
a
dangerous
precedent,
to
say
that
attorneys'
fees
and
expert
fees
are
exactly
the
same.
i
think
from
a
historical
standpoint
that
that's
a
dangerous
precedent.
and
i
think
that
that's
a
misreading
of
the
alyeska
case.
i
think
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
districts
involving
henkel
and
farmer,
for
example.
if
you
read
henkel,
henkel
was
written
prior
to
the
merger
of
law
and
equity.
henkel
was
written
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
henkel
involved
a
pure
question
of
law;
no
discretion
involved
whatsoever.
yet
certain
districts
are
using
henkel
as
the
foundation
of
saying
that
courts
have
no
discretion
to
award
costs
other
than
those
found
in
1920.
however,
in
farmer,
when
the
farmer
case
was
written,
when
the
farmer
case
came
to
this
court,
it
is
obvious
that
what
this
court
wanted
to
do
was
to
affirm
the
historical
position
of
equity
courts,
that
is,
that
equity
courts
have
this
broad
discretion--
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
--i
would
suggest
that...
justice
rehnquist...
that
it
was
not
dicta,
that
it
was
the
heart
of
the
case
that,
as
judge
posner
says,
dicta
is
to
be
determined
by
the
fact
of
whether
you
can
remove
the
language
and
have
the
opinion
make
sense.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court--
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
--absolutely.
that
was
the
only
purpose--
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
--the
opinion,
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
justice--
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
--it
was
used
to
demonstrate
that
the
lower
court
had
the
discretion
to
decide;
they
affirmed.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
they
denied
fees
in
excess
of
100
miles;
that's
correct.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
that's
correct,
justice
white.
however,
the
reading
of
the
case
certainly--
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
--i
don't
think...
i
think
the
farmer
case
says
very
clearly
that
the
trial
court
has
that
discretion
to
consider
whether
or
not.
i
think
looking
at
the
result,
basically,
begs
the
decision
in
the
case.
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
relate
to
the
power
and
discretion
of
a
united
states
district
court
to
tax
as
cost
against
the
loser
in
a
civil
lawsuit
expenses
incurred
by
the
winner
in
carrying
on
this
litigation.
that's
the
first
paragraph
of
justice
black's
opinion.
if
you
look
at
justice
harlan's
dissent,
the
last
paragraph
in
his
dissent
says,
the
scope
of
the
discretion
of
a
district
judge
acting
within
his
powers,
which
is
the
foundation
of
today's
decision.
that's...
that's
the
dissent.
it
was
clear
what
they
were
deciding,
that
is,
whether
or
not
a
district
judge
has
any
discretion
outside
of
1920.
and
what
they
found
was
that
judge
did
have
a
discretion
to
consider
additional
costs
outside
of
1920.
the
courts
who
have
ignored
farmer,
since
1965,
have
said,
the
reason
we
ignore
farmer
is
because
that
language
is
dictum.
i
suggest
a
reading
of
farmer
would
indicate
that
that
language
is
not
dictum
but
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
decision.
and
if
that
is
so,
and
i
would
urge
upon
this
court
that
that
is
so,
then
farmer
is
controlling.
henkel
need
not
be
reversed
because
it's
simply
inapplicable.
alyeska
dealt
with
attorneys'
fees,
a
different
animal;
an
entirely
different
animal.
we
suggest
to
this
court--
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
--that
distorts
the
historic
view
of
an
expert,
your
honor,
justice.
and
there
are
decisions
which
have
said
that
when
an
expert
becomes
an
advocate,
he
loses
his
objectivity
and
his
opinion
is
then
colored.
and
we
do
not
suggest
to
this
court
that
an
application
for
fees
of
an
expert
who
has
become
an
advocate
be
granted.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
but
is
that
not
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
expert
was
helpful
to
the
court,
rather
than
to
one
party
or
the
other,
in
determining
whether
to
award
fees.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
yes.
but
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
in
addition
to
that,
that
the
court
has
discretion
to
award
additional
costs.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
from
54(d).
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
justice
black
says
this:
while
this
rule
could
bed
far
more
definite
as
to
what,
quote,
costs
shall
be
allowed,
the
words,
quote,
unless
the
court
otherwise
directs,
quite
plainly
vests
some
power
in
the
court
to
allow,
quote,
some
costs.
that's
the
farmer
decision.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
perhaps.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
perhaps--
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
--justice
scalia,
that's
the
argument
proposed
by
the
proponent.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
that
does
not
fit
the
case...
the
farmer
case.
the
reading
of
the
farmer
cases
says
quite
clearly--
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
--that
was
the
result
of
farmer.
i
would
agree
with
that.
however,
the
purpose
of
farmer
was
to
demonstrate
the
inherent
equity
power
of
the
court
to
consider
additional
costs.
we
take
the
position
that
the
result
didn't
matter;
that
it's
the
principle
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
consider
costs
in
addition
to
1920.
and
farmer
clearly
says
that
that
is
the
fact.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
however,
unless
the
court
otherwise
directs,
justice
black
says,
therein
lies
the
ability
for
the
court
to
direct
other
costs.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
that's
correct.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
one
of
the
previous
questions,
that
is,
the
respondent
has
taken
the
position
that
the
discretion
talked
about
in
farmer
is
a
downward
discretion,
that
is,
that
the
court
has
the
discretion
to
disallow
costs.
i
would
suggest
that
a
reading
of
the
opinion
in
farmers
indicates
that
that
is
not
what
the
opinion
states,
nor
what
justice
black
was
talking
about.
he
said
in
his
opinion
that
we
do
not
read
the
rule,
being
rule
54(a),
as
giving
district
judges
unrestrained
discretion
to
tax
costs,
to
reimburse
a
winning
litigant
for
every
expense
he
has
seen
fit
to
incur
in
the
conduct
of
his
case.
he
goes
on
to
state
that
any
other
practice...
items
proposed
by
winning
parties
as
costs
should
always
be
given
careful
scrutiny.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
he
did
not
say
that.
mr.
ernest
p.
mansour
what
he
did
say
is,
therefore
the
discretion
given
district
judges
to
tax
costs
should
be
sparingly
exercised
with
reference
to
expenses,
not
specifically
allowed
by
statute.
i
propose
that
the
language
is
clear.
i
propose
that
the
meaning
is
clear.
i
propose
that
what
he
said
in
an
unambiguous
statement
was
that
the
court
in
spite
of--
