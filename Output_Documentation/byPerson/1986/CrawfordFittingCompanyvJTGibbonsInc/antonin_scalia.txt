justice
scalia
well,
you
could
come
to
that
conclusion
whether
or
not
you
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
alyeska.
i
mean,
you
could
come
to
that
conclusion
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation--
justice
scalia
--whether
you
think
alyeska
covers
these
things
or
not.
justice
scalia
well,
that
part
of
it
is
certainly
dicta.
maybe
to
disallow
some
costs.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
to
disallow
doesn't
necessarily
mean
to
allow.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
it
could
be,
and
this
is
the
argument,
that
the
rule
sets
forth
what
cost
will
be
awarded
automatically
when
the
court
says
nothing
at
all.
but
if
the
court
says
something,
maybe
all
of
those
costs
won't
be
allowed.
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
the
court
can
say,
additional
costs
will
be
allowed.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
but
that's
what
happened
in
farmer.
it
was
a
disallowance
of
cost,
rather
than
an
allowance.
justice
scalia
before
you
get
to
that,
counsel--
justice
scalia
--how
does
title
vii
get
into
this
case?
the
question
presented
does
not
mention
title
vii.
and
the
provisions
you're
about
to
argue
about
are
not
even
cited
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
i
didn't
even
know
that
we
were
going
to
talk
about
this.
justice
scalia
how
many
of
those
say
they
may,
and
how
many
of
them
say
they
must,
do
you
know?
justice
scalia
because
to
the
extent
they
say
they
must,
they
don't
help
your
case
very
much.
in
fact,
they
don't
help
your
case
at
all.
it's
only
those--
justice
scalia
--that's
right,
because
if
they
say
they
must,
it
doesn't
indicate
any
disbelief
on
congress'
part
that
the
court
couldn't
have
done
it
without
the
statute.
but
they're
just
saying,
we
know
you
could
do
it,
but
we're
saying
you
must
do
it.
justice
scalia
who
else
could
object
to
that...
who
else
could
object
to
that
direction?
since
it
went
to
anybody,
could
anybody
object
to
it?
justice
scalia
you
have
to
be
more
than
a
party.
you
have
to
be
harmed
by
the
direction--
justice
scalia
--not
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
i
really
don't
see
how
the
issue
gets
here.
you
should
have
cross-petitioned,
shouldn't
you,
if
you
want
this
kind
of
relief?
justice
scalia
if
you
want
this
kind
of
relief,
you
should
have
cross-petitioned.
justice
scalia
mr.
youngdahl,
i
can't
tell
you
how
often
it
is
that
lawyers
win
the
case
and
they
think
the
reasoning
is
terrible.
you
can't
appeal
because
you
don't
like
the
reason
you
were
given
a
victory.
justice
scalia
and
there
the
expert
could
be
paid
by
the
client.
justice
scalia
well,
we
see
some
pretty
big
numbers
once
in
awhile.
justice
scalia
--yes,
the
traditional--
justice
scalia
--sure,
sure.
but
these
other
things
you're
talking
about,
the
special
title
vii
additions,
are
only
in
for
the
plaintiff.
and
you've
got
a
defendant
here.
so
what
difference
does
it
matter
to
this
case?
what
difference
does
it
make
to
this
case?
justice
scalia
you
got
a
bad
dictum
down
there.
justice
scalia
because
they're
following
a
dictum
that's
no
good.
but
the
first
case
where
that
dictum
is
followed
can
be
appealed,
can't
it?
justice
scalia
that's
why
dicta
is
bad
stuff,
because
it
causes
people
to
follow
it,
but
we've
never
allowed
it
to
be
appealed
for
that
reason.
justice
scalia
xxx.
