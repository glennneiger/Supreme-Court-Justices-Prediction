statute?
justice
white
well,
my
question
now:
did
it...
did
it
result
in
denying
fees
or
granting
them?
justice
white
so
the
district
court
had...
didn't...
wasn't
required
the
grant
the
maximum
fees.
justice
white
that's
a
long
ways
from
saying
you
can
grant
more
than
the
statute
says
you
can.
justice
white
well,
54(d)
says,
except
where
express...
except
when
express
provision
therefore
is
made
either
in
a
statute
of
the
united
states
or
in
these
rules.
justice
white
well,
here's
1821,
says,
$30
a
day
for
witnesses.
justice
white
well,
they
didn't
direct
other
costs
in
farmer.
justice
white
well,
if
that's
a
holding,
i
don't
know
what
a
dictum
is.
justice
white
now,
you're
arguing
in
322,
86-322?
you're
arguing--
justice
white
--oh,
the
champion,
all
right.
justice
white
well,
why
were
we?
justice
white
we
denied
fees.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
we
didn't
allow
any
costs
that
weren't
authorized
by
statute.
justice
white
well,
what
do
you
mean
we're
focusing
on
allowing
costs,
then?
justice
white
yes,
and
as
justice
stevens
says,
to
deny
costs
even
though
they
might
have
been
allowable
within
the
statute.
justice
white
so
it
was
broader...
the
language
was
broader
than
the
holding?
justice
white
dictum
or
not?
justice
white
xxx
issue
is
contrary
to
yours?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
unless...
unless
the
court
appoints
them.
justice
white
xxx
that
means...
that
means
saying
that
1821
doesn't
mean
what
it
says.
justice
white
well,
of
course
it
can.
justice
white
yes.
what
if
congress
doesn't?
justice
white
no,
it
certainly
hasn't.
justice
white
even
to
plaintiffs?
justice
white
why
would
those
exceptions
allow
the
awarding
of
costs
that
congress
hasn't
provided
for?
justice
white
you
mean,
the
witness
fees,
$30
a
day
in
1821,
except
when
one
of
these
three
conditions
exist?
justice
white
weren't
we
just
talking
about
attorneys
fees
in
alyeska?
justice
white
well,
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
that
here,
do
we?
justice
white
no,
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
whether
one
of
these
exceptions
would
actually
allow--
justice
white
--expert
witness
fees.
justice
white
are
you
arguing
for--
--you're
arguing
for
your
opponents?
you're
arguing
on
the
side
of
your
opponents
in
a
sense?
justice
white
so
you're
saying
as
a
respondent,
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed
on
another
ground?
justice
white
xxx
ground
that
you
want
an
affirmance
on.
justice
white
but
you
say
that...
you
say
that
approaching
it
that
way
these
defendants
aren't...
weren't
entitled
to
expert
witness
fees
because
they
weren't
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees.
justice
white
which
is
a
different
ground
for
affirmance--
justice
white
--than
your
colleague
here
is
arguing?
justice
white

xxx.
justice
white
this
is
a
piece
of
statutory
construction.
justice
white
this
isn't
just
supervisory
power.
their
final
conclusion
says,
1821.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
they
direct
all
their
district
courts
to,
but
that's
just
surplussage,
they
could
have
put
a
period
after
their
first
sentence,
and
all
the
district
courts
would
have
had
to
comply.
justice
white
so
it's
a
piece
of
statutory
construction,
and
it's
really
a
question
of,
did
they
construe
the
statute
correctly.
justice
white
well,
that's
a
strange
way
of...
strange
way
of
saying
that;
1988
doesn't
say
that.
justice
white
where
does
something
say
it
that
would
overturn
or
would
suggest
that
1821
doesn't
govern?
justice
white
like
1821.
justice
white
where
do
you
get
that?
justice
white
so
expert,
attorneys
fees
are
expert
witness
fees,
or
expert
witness
fees
are
attorneys
fees;
is
that--
justice
white
but
attorneys'
fees
in
turn
are
part
of
cost;
is
that
it?
