mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
champion
echoes
the
arguments
made
by
mr.
mansour
concerning
rule
54(d)
and
the
inherent
equitable
powers
of
federal
courts.
i
would,
with
the
court's
permission,
like
to
focus
our
time,
with
one
exception,
on
the
issues
arising
out
of
champion's
status
as
a
title
vii
defendant.
but
before
i
get
to
that,
i
wanted
to
finish
up
something
that
you
were
discussing
with
mr.
mansour.
and
in
our
last
brief,
as
well
as
our
original
brief,
we
have
cited
to
the
court
the
case
of
fishgold.
and
i
believe
that
that
to
be...
that
to
be
the
correct
understanding
of
this
proviso
in
rule
54(d).
our
position
is,
as
in
feingold...
or
fishgold,
that
is
congress
has
prohibited
expressly,
as
it
did
in
the
veterans
reemployment
act,
taxation
of
costs
against
a
party,
the
court
can't
do
it.
but
otherwise,
the
court
has
inherent
equitable
discretion,
recognized
by
rule
54(d),
to
define
costs.
to
the
title
vii
aspects
of
the
case.
the
most
direct
way
to
put
our
position
to
you
is
that
champion
is
entitled
to
the
same
rule
to
which
any
of
the
other
litigants
in
this
case
is
entitled.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
i
think
that's
a
good
point.
and
my...
my
interest
in
the
issue
is
in
response
to
briefs
filed
by
the
woodworkers'
union
in
this
matter.
the
issue
arises,
i
suppose,
from
the
woodworkers'
standpoint,
because
our
client,
champion,
was
a
successful
defendant
in
a
title
vii
action.
we
requested
our
fees,
our
expert
witness
fees,
under
rule
54(d).
the
woodworkers
are
arguing
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
they
say
54(d)
does
not
include
this
inherent
equitable
discretion,
that
title
vii
defendants
somehow
are
a
different
group
of
litigant,
and
that
we
should
be
held...
if
discretion
exists,
we
should
only
get
them
once
christianburg
criteria
had
been
satisfed.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
christianburg
criteria
were
not
satisfied,
and
that
if
christianburg
is
held
to
apply
to
expert
witness
costs,
that
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
them.
but
to
your
original
point,
i
agree
with
you.
we
requested
our
expert
witness
costs
from
the
district
court
under
rule
54(d),
the
district
judge
decided,
determined,
that
he
didn't
have
any
discretion
for
us
to
even
approach
him
with
that
question;
that
it
didn't
exist.
and
what
we're
here
to
do
today
is
to
echo
mr.
mansour's
arguments
that
rule
54(d)
does
include
such
discretion.
but
i
would
add--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
yes,
sir,
we
do.
and...
and
we
would
echo
mr.
mansour's
remarks
in
that
respect.
i
submit
to
you,
mr.
youngdahl
on
behalf
of
the
woodworkers
will
argue
that
even
if
rule
54(d)
does
not
include
this
discretion
that
we
say
does
exist,
that
title
vii
plaintiffs
would
be
allowed
to
put
their
arguments
to
the
court
for
such
an
award,
but
no
one
else
would,
because
their
position
that
expert
witness
fees
are
nothing
different
than
attorneys'
fees;
and
that
only
where
congress
has
authorized
courts
to
award
attorneys'
fees
would
a
litigant
be
entitled
to
them.
we
don't
think
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
the
question
of
whether
a
title
vii
defendant
would
be
exposed
to
a
different
standard?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
i
don't
think
that
you'd
have
to
decide
it
in
this
case.
because,
again,
our
original
request
to
the
district
court
was
for
expert
witness
costs
under
rule
54(d).
since
we
only
have
15
minutes,
and
since
mr.
youngdahl's
brief
on
behalf
of
the
woodworkers
is
solely
devoted
to
that
issue,
we're
prepared
to
respond
to
whatever
questions
you
may
have
concerning
that.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
you're
interested
in
additional
discussion
on
rule
54(d),
we're
more
than
interested
and
more
than
willing
to
pursue
that
with
you.
because
i
think,
that
is
the
first...
the
first
step
for
us.
we
want
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
say,
you
sat
there,
it
essentially
says
this
in
your
opinion,
but
you
could
not
have
decided
the
case
without
the
testimony
of
our
expert
witness.
there
is
no
reasonable
way
that
this
case
could
have
been
decided
for
either
party
without
the
testimony
of
the
expert
witness.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
well,
that's
a
different
"can't
decide
the
case",
i
submit
to
you.
in
our
instance,
the
case
could
not
have
been
decided
because
there
was
no
one
in
the
courtroom
capable
of
performing
the
calculations;
no
one
with
the
education
and
training
to
perform
the
calculations
that
were
necessary
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
well,
yes,
yes,
that's
true.
we're
not
talking
about
fact
witnesses
here.
we're
talking
about
expert
witnesses,
which
are,
everyone
concedes,
to
be
a
different
breed
of
horse.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
no,
i
wouldn't.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
well,
i
would
say
that...
i
would
say
that,
to
the
extent
that
farmer,
and
coming
back
to
some
of
these
questions,
i
think
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
farmer,
it
would
go
along
those
lines,
whether
we're
just
talking
about
certain
types
of
nonstatutory,
non-attorneys'
fees
costs,
or
are
you
going
to
limit
yourself
to
things
like
expert
costs,
third
party...
third
party
costs.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
no,
it
doesn't.
and
that's
what
we
perceived
to
be
one
of
the
critical
features
of
rule
54(d),
is,
on
the
trial
bench,
you're
talking
about
a
world
of
different
litigation
type
expenses.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
right.
and
only
the
trial
judge--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--no,
they
would
not.
because
again,
with
the
distinction,
very
vast
distinction
we
believe,
to
be
drawn
between
attorneys
and
traditional
out
of
pocket
expenses
that
attorneys
incur
in
presenting
a
case,
and
the
question
of
bringing
someone
in
to
help
the
court,
to
help
the
judge
and
the
jury
decide
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
they
do,
but
in
an
entirely
different
sense,
and
they
have
an
entirely
different
duty,
we
submit,
to
the
court
than
a
witness
or
an
expert
witness.
an
attorney
is
duty
bound
to
be
biased
in
favor
of
his
client.
an
attorney
is
duty
bound
to
present
only...
to
the
extent
it
wouldn't
be
a
concealment,
but
to
put
his
client's
best
foot
forward.
and
although
unfortunately
there
are
some
instances
where
experts
can
get
out
of
hand
and
become
advocates,
i
submit
that
that
fortunately
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule,
and
that
a
trial
judge
more
than
anyone
is
capable
of
seeing
that
early
on
in
a
trial.
i...
i
come
back
and
point
out
to
you
that,
again,
back
to
the
limited
extent
that
mr.
youngdahl
i
know
will
be
talking
about
title
vii,
i
want
to
encourage
you,
when
you
consider...
if
you
consider
whether
title
vii
policy
might
somehow
be
violated
by
allowing
us
to
make
these
arguments
to
the
trial
court,
if
you
just
go
through
what
analysis
it
would
be.
i
think
very
clearly
the
first
thing
that
the
trial
judge
would
look
at
what
whether
our
expert
witness
costs
were
indispensable
to
the
case.
that
goes
no
violence
to
any
principle,
any
statement
by
a
congressman
or
anything
like
that,
in
title
vii.
secondly,
i
believe
it's
unquestioned,
and
has
been
unquestioned,
that
in
exercising
its
equitable
discretion,
courts
look
to
the
relative
ability
of
parties
to
pay.
that
has
been
a
theme
raised
by
the
woodworkers
in
this
case
throughout
it,
that
title
vii
plaintiffs
on
large
are
impecunious
plaintiffs.
there's
no
question
that
that
tends
to
be
true.
however,
they're
not
all
impecunious.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
champion
case,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
yes,
sir.
there's
no
question
that
many,
many
title
vii
plaintiffs
are
impecunioius.
but
the
woodworkers'
union
is
not
an
impecunious
plaintiff.
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
is
not
an
impecunious
plaintiff.
and
if
we're
able
to
convince
the
trial
judge
that
the
relative
equities
of
all
of
this
are
on
our
side,
if
he
recognizes
that
there's
nothing
wrong
on
the
facts
of
this
case
with
giving
us
the
expert
witness
costs,
i
submit
to
you
that
it's
an
inherent
and
traditional
power
of
the
trial
court
to
do
that.
and
that's
really,
when
you
boil
all
this
down,
both
sides,
the
54(d)
question
and
to
whatever
extent
title
vii
is
involved
here--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--very
rarely.
and
i
believe
if
you
look
in
the
crawford
fitting
brief,
you
will
notice
the
experience
under
the
third
circuit,
which
has
for
a
long
time
permitted
the
standard
that
we're
arguing
for.
the
trial
judges
are
very
hard
nosed
about
this.
and
they're
not
just
simply
opening
up
some
kind
of
floodgates
so
everybody
gets
their
expert
witness
costs.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
a
difficult
standard
for
any
litigant
to
meet,
to
convince
the
trial
judge
that
he
couldn't
have
decided
the
case
without
that
expert.
most
trial
judges
believe
they
can
decide
the
case
with
very
little
testimony
in
some
instances;
and
the
expert
testimony
to
them
is...
may
or
may
not
be
superfluous.
and
you'll
find
very
many
decisions
which
say
precisely
that
when
they
deny
them.
one
additional
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that,
if
you're
concerned...
if
anyone's
concerned
about
the
dollar
amounts
involved,
i
submit
to
you
that
in
every
case...
almost
every
case
that
i've
ever
been
involved
with,
simple
depositions
costs
frequently
come
to
extraordinary
amounts.
and
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
insulate
title
vii
plaintiffs
from
all
possible
financial
responsibility,
they
would
have
also
insulated
them
from
the
presumptively
taxable
statutory
costs.
they
have
not.
there's
never
been
any
discussion
of
it.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
yes,
they
are.
but
if
we
come
back
to
trying
to
balance
title
vii
policy
in
all
of
this,
the
argument
that
we've
heard
from
the
woodworkers
and
the
amicus
is
that
you
can't
do
that.
any
financial...
possible
financial
hurdle
to
a
title
vii
plaintiff
will
chill
their
willingness
to
file
suit.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
well,
i'll
go
back.
mr.
mansour's
response
to
that
is...
is
that
that's
what
they
did.
but
if
you
go
back
and
read
the
opinion,
they
did
deny--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--there's
no
question
that
they
have
discretion
to
deny
them.
there's
no
question
under
our
proposed
standard
that
they
would
have
discretion
to
deny
expert
witness
costs.
the
question
is
whether
it
extends--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--to
allow
them.
and
i
think
very
clearly
from
farmer
that's
what
you
were
looking
at.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
because
that's
the
fundamental
question--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--you
affirmed
the
denial
of
them.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
and
added--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--no,
you
didn't.
and
i've
never
taken--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--no,
i
don't
think
you
focused
on
allowing
costs.
i
think
you
were
focusing
on
the
discretion
in
farmer.
and
very
clearly--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--that
was
the
fact
of
farmer,
that's
true.
but
the
passage
from
the
case
that
mr.
mansour
read
you,
as
well
as
the
last
sentence
from
the
dissent
in
that
opinion
i
think
very
clearly
points
out
that
it
was
broader
than
the
simple
facts
of
that
case,
and
that
the
trial
court's
overall
discretion--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--yes.
i
will
concede
that.
but
i
don't
believe--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
walker
--but
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
excise
that
language
from
the
farmer
opinion
itself.
