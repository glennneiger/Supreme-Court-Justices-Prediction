mr.
william
h.
block
i
represent
j.t.
gibbons,
inc.,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
and
i
will
be
addressing
in
my
portion
of
divided
argument
the
issue
whether
this
court
should
hold
the
district
courts
have
power
to
award
expert
witness
fees
in
excess
of
the
amount
specified
in
statute
where
the
district
court,
as
mr.
mansour
phrased
it,
determines
that
the
expert
materially
enabled
the
district
court
to
arrive
at
its
decision.
mr.
youngdahl,
on
behalf
of
international
woodworkers,
will
address
the
effect
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
the
civil
rights
attorneys
fees
act
of
1976,
on
awards
of
expert
witness
fees.
mr.
william
h.
block
which
is
not
involved
in
my
case
at
all.
my
case
involves--
mr.
william
h.
block
--actually,
he
agrees
with
mine
with
regard
to
the
general
discretion.
he
believes
that
there
is
a
particular
statutory
authorization
that
would
allow
plaintiffs
to
recover
attorneys
fees
in
title
vii.
mr.
william
h.
block
and
my
position
is
that
where
congress
has
spoken
and
given
a
statutory
authorization,
the
courts
certainly
may
follow
that
authorization.
the
question
that
is
posed
by
this
case
is
whether,
when
congress
has
defined
a
maximum
amount,
courts
may
exceed
it.
let
me
start
by
reviewing
briefly
the
regulation
of
expert
witness
fees
in
the
federal
court.
the
basic
amounts
payable
to
witnesses
are
defined
by
28
usc
section
1821.
that
is
a
direct
successor
to
the
fee
act
of
1863,
which
prescribed
the
amounts
that
were
payable
to
witnesses...
that
were
taxable
as
costs
for
witnesses
in
federal
courts.
the
fee
act
by
its
terms
covered
both
law
and
equity
cases.
and
that
now
appears
no
longer
to
be
in
dispute.
equity
cases
routinely
held
that
the
fee
act
governed
the
taxation
of
witnesses...
witness
fees
in
federal
courts.
the
fee
act
covered
both
lay
and
expert
witnesses.
and
that
was
directly
the
issue
faced
by
this
court
in
henkel
v.
minneapolis,
st.
paul
and
omaha
railway.
in
that
case,
the
expert
witness
fees
had
not
been
governed
by
the
federal
statute,
they
were
awardable
under
state
law,
under
the
rules
of
decision
act.
if
they
were
regulated
by
federal
statute,
they
were
not
so
awarded.
the
court
held
that
they
were
regulated
by
the
statute
that
is
now
section
1821.
the
congress
has
definitely
prescribed
its
own
requirement
with
respect
to
the
fees
of
witnesses,
and
i'm
quoting.
the
congress
has
dealt
with
the
subject
comprehensively,
and
has
made
no
exception
of
the
fees
of
expert
witnesses.
under
these
provisions,
additionally
amounts
paid
as
compensation
or
fees
to
expert
witnesses
cannot
be
allowed
or
taxed
as
costs
in
cases
in
federal
courts.
mr.
william
h.
block
unless
the
court
appoints
them.
and
congress
has
dealt...
congress
has
continued
to
regulate,
exactly,
mr.
justice,
the
times
at
which
expert
witness
fees
in
excess
of
those
statutory
amounts,
may
be
taxed.
we
cited
in
our
brief
at
pages
23
to
24
29
statutes
involving
some
34
provisions
defining...
and
congress
defining...
exactly
when
expert
witness
fees
in
addition
to
those
specified
in
section
1821,
may
be
awarded.
mr.
william
h.
block
i
believe
they
predominantly
say
they
may;
some
of
them
say
they
shall.
but
i
believe--
mr.
william
h.
block
--in
the
sense...
in
the
sense,
if
that
was
congress
wishing
to
take
away
the
discretion
to
deny
that
it's
recognized
in
farmer?
mr.
william
h.
block
i
wouldn't
so
read
them.
but
i
believe
predominantly
they
say,
the
court
may.
and
in
one
example
on
that
is
congress'
own
distinction
between
a
private
expert
witness
and
a
court
appointed
expert,
to
return
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white.
let's
look
at
what
congress
has
done
and
required
in
federal
rule
of
evidence
706,
which
is
then
tied
to
28
usc
section
1920
sub
6,
with
respect
to
a
court
appointed,
as
opposed
to
a
private
expert.
a
private
expert
engages
his
ingenuity
on
behalf
of
his
client.
that's
not
wrong.
that's
what
he's
engaged
to
do.
he
presents
the
strength
of
his
client's
case.
and
in
the
adversarial
system,
it
is
for
the
adversary
to
present
the
weakness
in
the
experts'
client's
case.
the
court
appointed
expert
is
quite
different.
rule
706
says,
first,
that
a
witness
so
appointed
shall
be
informed
of
his
duties
by
the
court
in
writing,
a
copy
of
which
shall
be
filed
with
the
clerk
or
at
a
conference
in
which
the
parties
shall
have
the
opportunity
to
participate.
now,
when
a
court
informs
an
expert
of
his
duties,
the
court
says,
i
would
like
you
to
present
not
only
the
strengths
of
one
side,
but
the
strengths
of
the
other
side.
i
would
like
you
to
present
not
only
the
weaknesses
of
the
other
side,
but
the
weaknesses
of
the
side
that
you
might
otherwise
have
represented.
the
expert
is
not
part
of
the
adversarial
process.
he
is
presenting
both
sides.
there's
a
second
portion
to
that
phrase.
the
parties
participate
in
the
framing
of
the
instructions.
and
the
framing
of
the
instructions
to
an
expert
may
determine
the
outcome.
if
a
party
can
say,
look
not
just
at
this
market
share
but
at
that
market
share;
look
not
just
at
this
item
of
business,
but
at
that
patent
and
its
effect
upon
the
market;
the
expert
may
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
congress
has
said,
with
a
court
appointed
expert,
both
sides
get
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
those
instructions.
the
rule
continues
that
a
witness
so
appointed
shall
advise
the
parties
of
his
findings.
he
reports
to
both
sides.
in
discovery
a
private
expert's
opinions
can
only
be
limitedly
discovered.
in
this
case,
the
expert
is
fully
available
to
both
sides.
congress
has
made
the
determination
that
in
this
situation
expert
witness
fees
in
addition
to
those
specified
in
section
1821
may
be
taxed
as
costs.
congress
has
comprehensively
regulated
that
situation,
and
has
made
choices.
to
adopt
a
new
rule
allowing
a
broad
based
grant
of
expert
witness
fees
in
excess
of
those
specified
in
section
1821
would
substantially
disrupt
the
congressional
provisions.
and
nowhere
in
fact
is
that
clearer
than
the
case
before
the
court.
j.t.
gibbons,
inc.,
is
an
antitrust
plaintiff.
under
the
antitrust
laws,
15
usc
section
15,
congress
has
provided
that
a
prevailing
plaintiff
is
to
recover
his
reasonable
attorneys'
fees.
a
defendant
is
not.
congress
has
struck
a
balance.
and
the
court
since
1926,
the
strauss
v.
victor
talking
machine
case,
have
held
that
neither
side
under
those
antitrust
provisions
may
recover
their
expert
witness
fees.
so
we
have
a
situation
in
which
congress
has
said,
we
wish
to
favor
plaintiffs
to
a
particular
degree
to
encourage
private
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
we
know
this
will
burden
defendants,
but
that
will
discourage
them
from
violating
the
laws.
it
is
a
balance
that
congress
has
struck.
neither
side
is
to
recover
their
expert
witness
fees.
this
is
something
congress
has
chosen
to
do.
and
they
have
reviewed
the
antitrust
laws,
probably
as
much
as
any
on
the
books.
and
they
have
never
seen
fit
to
shift
the
allocation
of
the
burden
of
expert
witness
fees
from
where
it
sits
under
statute.
the
exception
proposed
by
petitioners
in
this
case
would
substantially
disrupt
the
antitrust
laws
in
that
respect.
mr.
william
h.
block
attorneys
fees
or--
mr.
william
h.
block
--that
is
not
at
issue
in
our
case.
mr.
william
h.
block
in
view
of
my
construction
of
the
law,
the
lower
courts
have
been
consistent
in
holding
that
a
prevailing
plaintiff
is
not
so
entitled.
i
certainly
would
not
object
if
the
court
were
to
reconstrue
the
statute.
but
if
the
court
construed
the
statute
to
allow
plaintiffs
to
recover
expert
witness
fees,
still
certainly
defendants
could
not.
because
the
statute
is
a
plaintiffs-only
statute
in
all
regards.
so
the
question
of
whether
plaintiffs
can
or
not--
mr.
william
h.
block
--congress
can
by
additional
statute
provide
for
additional
attorney
fees.
mr.
william
h.
block
i
mean,
excuse
me,
additional
expert
witness
fees.
mr.
william
h.
block
if
congress
does
not,
then
they
are
not
awardable.
unless
15
usc
section
15
were
determined
by
the
court
to
include
expert
witness
fees,
which
it
has
never
been
read
as
being.
mr.
william
h.
block
then
we
are
in
agreement.
i
believe
they
are
not
awardable
under
15
usc
section
15.
mr.
william
h.
block
even
to
plaintiffs.
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court,
but
i
believe
they
are
not
awardable,
and
that
congress
has
made
a
determination
as
to
that
allocation.
the
farmer
case,
which
is
relied
upon
extensively
by
petitioners,
i
believe
has
been
discussed
during
the
primary
argument.
in
that
case
congress
by
statute
allowed
recovery
of
a
particular
cost.
it
stated
that
witness
travelling
from
outside
the
continental
united
states
shall
recover
their
actual
costs
of
travel.
the
district
court
was
therefore
authorized
by
congress
to
award
those
amounts.
it
declined
to
do
so.
it
exercised
discretion
not
to
do
so,
which
is
recognized
in
rule
54
as,
unless
the
court
otherwise
directs.
that's
the
rule
54
discretion.
that
is
all
that
farmer
upheld.
it
did
not
suggest
that
this
court
should
exceed
congressional
limits.
alyeska
pipeline
service
company
v.
wilderness
society
is
directly
on
point
in
its
reasoning.
it
stated
that
where
congress
has
comprehensively
regulated
the
award
of
costs
between
solicitor
and
client,
which
are
the
private
costs
developed
to
support
one
side,
that
this
court
should
not
create
exceptions
to
that
rule.
alyeska
did
recognize
three
traditional
exceptions,
which
it
held
that
congress
had
understood
and
effectively
incorporated
into
the
statutes.
mr.
william
h.
block
the
court
stated
that
in
developing
its
congressional
schemes,
congress
had
understood
those
three
to
exist.
mr.
william
h.
block
well,
i
can
do
no
better
than--
mr.
william
h.
block
is
there
a
difference
between
attorneys
fees
and
witness
fees?
witness
fees
have
been
as
regulated
as
attorneys
fees.
you
were
just
talking
about
attorneys
fees
in
alyeska.
but
the
principle
was
the
regulation,
and
the
degree
of
regulation.
witness
fees
have
been
as
regulated
as
attorneys
fees,
and
in
the
same
statutes.
mr.
william
h.
block
--attorneys
fees?
mr.
william
h.
block
no.
mr.
william
h.
block
no,
none
of
these
exceptions
is
met
here.
the
only
question
is
whether
a
new
exception
should
be
created.
and
i
submit
that
it
should
not.
as
this
court
stated
in
alyeska:
it
appears
to
us
that
the
rule
suggested
here
would
make
major
inroads
on
a
policy
matter
that
congress
has
reserved
for
itself.
since
the
approach
taken
by
congress
to
this
issue
has
been
to
carve
out
specific
exceptions
to
a
general
rule
that
federal
courts
cannot
award
attorneys
fees
beyond
the
limits
of
28
usc
section
1923,
which
was
what
was
at
stake
there,
those
courts
are
not
free
to
fashion
drastic
new
rules
with
respect
to
the
allowance
of
attorneys'
fees
to
the
prevailing
party
in
federal
litigation.
petitioner's
exception
would
effectively
swallow
the
rule
that
congress
has
established.
taking
only
the
antitrust
laws
as
an
example,
in
virtually
all
mainstream
antitrust
cases,
an
expert
is
going
to
materially
enable
the
district
court
to
arrive
at
its
decision.
one
needs
an
expert
to
show
the
market,
to
show
the
effect
upon
the
market,
to
define
whether
or
not
predatory
pricing
is
indeed
unjustifiably
low
pricing
by
statistical
and
economic
evidence;
to
show
statistical
evidence
of
concerted
parallelism
if
that
is
what
is
at
issue.
in
virtually
every
antitrust
case
an
expert
is
going
to
materially
assist
the
district
court.
yet
congress
has
said
in
15
usc
section
15
that
only
plaintiffs
get
attorneys
fees,
and
neither
side
gets
expert
witnesses.
there
would
be
the
substantial
disruption
that
alyeska
refused
to
create
if
the
rule
suggested
by
petitioners
were
adopted
here.
mr.
william
h.
block
yes,
it
was.
mr.
william
h.
block
i
did
not
try
it.
mr.
william
h.
block
no.
actually,
san
francisco
counsel
tried,
not
in
my
law
firm.
mr.
william
h.
block
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
block
they
associated
local
counsel,
your
honor.
