mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
a
very
narrow
sense,
my
client
won
below.
the
international
woodworkers
doesn't
have
to
pay
$11,000
in
expert
witness
fees
to
champion
under
any
theory,
under
any
judge's
view
of
the
amount
of
money
set
by
the
magistrate.
but
in
a
broader
and
much
more
serious
sense,
the
iwa
and
private
enforcement
of
the
nation's
civil
rights
laws
suffered
a
grievous
blow
by
that
decision.
the
portion
of
the
decision
that
is
really
damaging
outside
of
the
discussion
of
the
issue
about
expert
witness
fees
being
recoverable
in
title
vii
cases--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--no,
sir,
i'm
not.
i
don't
understand
it
to
be
that.
he
is
saying
that
if
title
vii
considerations
are
to
apply,
that...
he
said
they're
not
to
apply.
and
i'm
saying
they
are
to
apply.
and
i'm
saying,
moreover,
the
intention
of
congress
of
how
expert
witness
fees
are
dealt
with
as
part
of
attorneys
fees,
how
congress
defined
attorneys
fee
in
the
civil
rights
attorneys
fee
award
act
of
1976
is
a
critical
question.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i'm
arguing
for
affirmance,
but
i'm
arguing
for
reversal
of
the
direction
the
court
majority
below,
and
the
en
banc
majority,
extends
its
opinion
by
saying,
in
the
exercise
of
our
supervisory
power,
we
direct
all
district
courts
to
follow
this
rule
that
nobody
gets
expert
witness
fees.
it
doesn't
say
at
that
point,
but
it
clearly
means,
including
title
vii
plaintiffs.
now,
title
vii
plaintiffs--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--well,
we
certainly
were
a
party,
your
honor.
we
didn't
petition
for
certiorari,
but
in
our
response--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--all
right,
well,
we
are
directly
harmed
in
that
our--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--not
in
this
case;
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
rule
about
cross-petitioning
that
if
the
judgment,
the
bottom
line
judgment
is
affirmed,
and
we
are
not
asking
for
more
or
less
than
the
affirmed
decision.
we're
asking
that
affirmed...
be
affirmed
here,
but
we
are
objecting
to
the
reasoning
of
a
court
in
reaching
that.
we
ask
for
reinstatement
of
the
district
court's
reasoning,
the
panel
reasoning,
and
the
reasoning
of
every
other
circuit.
and
the
problem
comes
in
the
direction.
i
certainly
considered
that.
it
seemed
to
me
that
since
we
were
saying
that
the
judgment
stands,
that
we
did
not
have
to
cross-petition.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i
didn't
appeal,
your
honor.
and
i'm
saying
that
what...
it's
the
direction.
if
they
had
not
put
in
there...
if
there
had
been
a
panel,
a
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit,
and
they
had
said,
we
think
we
ought
to
do
this
for
this
reasoning,
we
could
go
to
another
panel,
we
could
do
lots
of
things.
but
this
was
an
en
banc
decision,
number
one.
and
it
was
a
decision
which
says
we,
in
the
exercise
of
our
supervisory
power,
we
direct
the
courts
and
the
fifth
circuit
to
do
that.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes,
sir.
the
problem
right
now,
and
this
is
a
problem
not
only
from
my
experience,
but
a
problem
discussed
in
the
congressional
hearing
for
the
1976
legislation,
the
problem
is,
that
since
june
2nd,
1986,
when
this
decision
was
issued,
and
its
direction
was
issued,
that
when
a
civil
rights
plaintiff
walks
in
with
a
perfectly
good
case
to
a
lawyer's
office
in
mississippi
or
louisiana
or
texas
and
so
on,
and
says,
okay,
will
you
take
our
case,
the
lawyer
has
a
choice
of
doing
one
of
three
things,
under
the
direction
in
this
case.
number
one,
he
could
say,
well
try
it
without
an
expert
witness.
very
dangerous,
as
i
learned
on
the
merits
of
the
very
case
at
bar.
two...
and
certainly
not
practical
in
the
growing
complexity
of
litigation...
two,
he
can
say,
i'll
reduce
my
attorneys'
fee
expectancy,
because
i
as
a
lawyer
will
be
responsible
for
paying
the
expert
bill,
and
go
ahead
and
contract
with
an
expert,
and
we'll
present
our
best
case,
but
i
won't
get
a
reasonable
attorneys
fee
in
accordance
with
market
rates,
et
cetera.
or
three,
he
can
reject
the
case,
and
say,
i
can't
afford
to
do
this.
now,
those
are
the
only
choices
open
to
him,
and
those
very
choices
were
discussed
at
length
in
day
after
day
hearings
before
congress
on
the
1976
civil
rights
attorneys
fee
award
legislation.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that's
true,
your
honor.
if
there's
a
big
back
pay
award,
it's
likely
to
be
a
class
award,
and
the
amount
going
to
individual
people--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--it's
a
possibility.
it's
not
typical
in
my
experience,
but
it
certainly
is
a
possibility.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
but
when
there
are
large
classes,
so
that
the
individual
entitlement
may
not
have
been
all
that
much.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that,
your
honor.
i
would
let
everyone
else
take
care
of
that.
i
agree
with
the
counsel
for
the
correspondent.
i
think
it
is
an
awkward
situation.
it
was
created
frankly
out
of
the
consolidation
of
these
two
cases;
it's
a
different
issue.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes,
totally.
i
think
what
judge
rubens
said
is
the
way
he
read
what
congress
said.
and
it's
impossible,
reasonably,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
to
get
any
other
kind
of
conclusion,
it
seems
to
me.
as
he
looked
at
what
congress
meant,
he
says,
congress
says,
attorneys'
fees
for
purposes
of
civil
rights
litigation
are
all
those
amounts
that
an
attorney
normally
bills
his
client
for;
which
include
expert
witness
fees.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
both,
your
honor.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
since
the
legislative
history
is
sparse
with
title
vii,
that
it
will
look
to
1988--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--yes,
sir,
it
was
patterned
exactly
after
it.
and
the
congress...
both
house
and
senate
reports,
and
repeatedly
on
the
floor,
members
of
congress
said,
we
want
to
pattern
1988
after
title
vii
because
we
want
to
have
exactly
the
same
judicial
interpretation
of
the
attorneys
fee
section...
the
attorneys
fee
section...
of
title
vii
transposed
over
and
continued
in
1988,
and
repeal
alyeska
or
reverse
alyeska
with
respect
to
civil
rights
litigation.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that's
right,
because
of
christianburg.
exactly
right.
and
congress--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--precisely.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
precisely,
your
honor.
but
the
problem
is
that
if
we
don't
get
that,
it's
not
going
to
be
a
question
of
lawyers
losing
cases
and
having
an
opportunity
to
appeal
and
reach
this
issue
next
year
or
whenever.
it
means
that
the
prospective
opportunity
to
file
civil
rights
lawsuits
that
are
going
on
right
away,
right
now
today,
in
those
states,
is
lost.
because
lawyers
can't
afford
to
take
cases
without
having
some
sort
of
opportunity
to
recover
expert
witness
fees,
which
the
fifth
circuit
majority
has
said,
no,
you
don't
have;
you
don't
ever
have.
yes,
we
agree
totally
with
judge
rubens'
analysis.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
what
they
say
there,
the
last
sentence--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--well,
do
it
anyway.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
that's
true.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
just
makes
it
more
evident
to
the
district
judges
that
in
no
way
and
at
no
time
in
civil
rights
litigation
can
they
award
expert
witness
fees
to
prevailing
plaintiffs.
now,
i
urge
the
most
careful
examination
of
the
legislative
history
which
the
amici
brief
particularly
deals
with.
there
was
a
statement
from
the
floor
by
the
chief
sponsor
saying,
the
term,
attorneys
fees,
means
all
expenses
necessary
for
effective--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--no,
but
for
a
very
good
reason,
your
honor.
because
1988,
unless--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--your
honor,
1821
and
the
statutes
and
rule
54
particularly
say
that
other
than
when
provided
for
by
congress
in
other
matters.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
okay,
so
we're
saying
it
was
provided
for
in
other
matters
by
1988.
and
we're
saying
the
reason
it
doesn't
say
the
words,
expert
witness
fees,
is
because
congress
intended
a
broader
concept
than
that.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
from
the
legislative
history.
the
house
report
and
the
senate
report
say,
over
and
over
again,
the
reason
we
are
tracking
exactly
title
vii
language
is
because
we
want
to
reinstate
title
vii
case
law
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word,
attorneys
fee.
and
title
vii
case
law
of
attorneys
fees
says,
case
after
case
after
case,
says,
expert
witness
fees,
travel,
all
sorts
of
other
things
outside
of
1821,
are
included
in
the
kind
of
expenses
an
attorney
normally
bills
his
client;
included
therefore
in
what
attorneys
fees
means
in
this
statute,
and
should
be
recoverable
by
prevailing
plaintiff;
not
by
prevailing
defendant
because
of
christianburg,
but
by
prevailing
plaintiff.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes.
all
the
things
that
an
attorney
has
to
spend
for
the
effective
presentation
of
the
case.
you
have
to
be
reasonable.
the
court
has
discretion
in
granting
them
to
be
sure.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
makes
a
whole
lot
of
difference
whether
they're
called
costs
or
fees.
congress
called
them
fees.
representative
drinan
got
up...
the
key
sponsor
in
the
house
got
up
on
the
floor
and
said,
these...
the
term,
attorneys
fees,
includes
expert
witness
fees...
i'm
not
sure
he
used
the
term,
expert
witness
fees,
but
all
things
necessary
which
are
expenditures
for
the
prosecution
of
the
case.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
i
think
that
is
more
clearly--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
have...
judge
wisdom
gave
me
the
same
kind
of
thing
on
the
first
fifth
circuit
panel.
but
congress
meant
them
as
part
of
fees.
congress
said,
we
intend
the
term,
fees,
to
include
all
the
necessary
outlay
that
an
attorney
had
as
normally
billed
a
client.
that's
what
congress
said.
and
i--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--sure.
i
would
be
subject
to
an
attack
on
nonreasonable.
i
mean
the
house
committee
said,
we
keep
the
reasonableness;
we
keep
the
discretion;
we
keep
the
prevailing
party
concept.
we
don't
have
a
mandatory
fee
like
the
antitrust
law
has,
and
some
other
statutes
have;
we
keep
those
things
in.
but
we
keep
those
things
in
because
we
want
to
incorporate
the
case
law
that's
developed
under
title
vii
and
title
ii
of
the
'64
civil
rights
act
and
the
voting
rights
act
of
1975
and
so
on.
and
all
that
case,
there
has
never
been
any
question
about
this
before
the
en
banc
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
i
think
that's
a
little
overstatement,
your
honor.
the
christianburg
said
that
unless
the
case
is
vexatious,
without
grounds,
or
brought
in
bad
faith--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
it
makes
a
difference
because
right
now--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--because
nobody
is
getting
representation.
people
are
getting
representation
at
great
peril
and
at
great
sacrifice
to
a
lawyer
or--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--it's
dictum
in
the
sense
that...
yes,
but
in
the
meantime,
prospective
litigation
has
been
turned
down
because
lawyers
cannot
undertake
this
kind
of
responsibility--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--well,
i'm
not
able
to
argue
that
you
have
ever
reversed
the
reasoning
below,
have
never
or
have,
and
upheld
the
judgment.
the--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--well...
thank
you
very
much.
