chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
two
consolidated
cases,
no.
86-322,
crawford
fitting
company
against
gibbons;
and
no.
86-328,
champion
international
corporation
against
international
woodworkers
of
america.
mr.
mansour,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
was
pretty
much
dicta
in
farmer,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
that
language
necessary
to
the
holding
in
farmer?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
what
was
it
used
for,
to
deny
or
grant
fees?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
can
just
answer
that
question,
can't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
it's
an
entirely
different
animal,
mr.
mansour.
expert
witnesses
are
in
fact
advocates
on
the
stand
the
same
way
lawyers
are
advocates
in
court,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
ones
who
become
advocates
may
be
more
successful
at
winning
their
cases
than
one
who
maintains
strict
neutrality.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
that's
the
standard
by
which
the
district
court
ought
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
award
fees
to
a
particular
expert?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
escape
the
limitation
on
witness
fees'
to
$30
a
day,
in
1821?
an
expert's
a
witness,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
does
it
get
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
54(d)
says,
unless...
unless
a
statute
otherwise
requires,
doesn't
it?
except
as
otherwise
regulated
by
statute?
what
is
that
language?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mansour.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
walker.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
concede,
i
take
it,
that
you're
not
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees
because
of
christianburg.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
expert
witness
fees
come
under
a
different
category?
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
ones
that
were
totally
unknown
to
me
in
practice
i
must
say.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
deposition
costs
are
authorized
by
statute,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walker.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
block.
and
just
to
keep
ourselves
straight,
you
represent
j.t.
gibbons,
inc.--
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
is
not
involved
in
your
case
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
assert
that
prevailing
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees
under
the
antitrust
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i'm
sorry,
expert
witness
fees.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
what's
your
view
on
it,
in
view
of
your
construction
of
the
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
block.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
youngdahl.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you're
arguing
for
affirmance
here,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
attorneys
fees
provision
in
title
vii
or
in
1988?
chief
justice
rehnquist
with
respect
to
the
attorneys'
fees
provision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
youngdahl.
mr.
mansour,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
he
could
have
meant
taxable...
costs
when
he
was--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--no,
but
he
wasn't
focused
on
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
mansour.
the
case
is
submitted.
