i
thought
you
were
just
arguing
this
as
a
straightforward
application
of
miranda.
justice

what
is
there
to
balance,
then?
justice
white
well,
suppose
we
didn't
held
this
in
miranda.
you
are
asking
us
to
nevertheless
hold
it
in
this
case
by
balancing?
justice
white
is
that
right?
justice
white
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
white
well,
does
that
mean
how
we
should
read
miranda,
is
that
it?
justice
white
let's
suppose
we
read
miranda
as
not
covering
this
case.
then
but
you
still
are
arguing
that
you
should
win?
justice
white
so,
it
doesn't
require
a
lot
of
balancing,
then,
does
it?
