chief

ms.
dewey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
part
of
the
miranda
warning,
ms.
dewey,
is
that
whatever
you
say
may
be
used
against
you
in
court,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
dewey.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
genuario.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
trial
court
found
against
your
client
on
that
latter
point,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
you
would
have
no
quarrel
then,
under
those
circumstances
if
the
police
had
not
made
any
notes
of
defendant's
statements
and
had
simply
relied
on
their
recollection
in
the
testimony
at
trial?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
could
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
do
you
agree
that
my
hypothesis
meets
your
ambiguousness
argument?
in
other
words,
the
ambiguity
as
you
see
it,
i
understood,
was
that
he
might
have
meant
that
nothing
should
be
written
down.
my
hypothesis
is,
nothing
is
written
down.
does
that
meet
your
ambiguity
problem?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
a
lot
of
people
probably
didn't
realize
that
miranda
was
quite
this
complicated.
i
can
see
from
the
way
you
view
it
that
a
hearing
like
this
could
go
on
for
days,
while
we
get
into
first
levels
of
ambiguity
and
second
levels
of
ambiguity.
it's
a
fairly
complicated
process,
i
take
it,
in
your
view.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
he
requested
counsel
conditionally
here.
he
said,
even
granting
all
your
business
about
ambiguity,
"if
it's
going
to
be
put
in
writing
i
want
counsel,
but
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
talk.
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
a
good
many
of
our
decisions
see
miranda
as
a
plain,
simple,
easy
to
follow
principle,
very
simple.
and
we
have
refused
times
and
again
to
add
on
any
additional
prophylactic
rules
such
as
the
one
you're
asking
us
to
add
on
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
genuario.
ms.
dewey,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
dewey.
the
case
is
submitted.
