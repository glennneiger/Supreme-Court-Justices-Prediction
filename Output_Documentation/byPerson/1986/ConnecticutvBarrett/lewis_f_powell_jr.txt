justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question,
was
the
respondent
ever
informed
that
the
police
were
attempting
to
the
tape
his
statement?
justice
jr.
the
police
tried
twice
to
do
it?
justice
jr.
and
when
they
discovered
they'd
fumbled
that,
then
they
undertook
to
write
our
their
recollection
of
what
he
had
said?
justice
jr.
they
did
attempt
to
write
it
out?
justice
jr.
and
they
used
that
to
refresh
their
recollection
before
they
testified?
justice
jr.
is
it
reasonable
for
us
to
suppose
that
if
respondent
had
known
they
trying
to
tape
his
statement,
or
to
write
it
out,
that
he
might
have
declined
to
talk
to
them
any
further?
do
you
understand
ny
question?
justice
jr.
yes,
yes.
in
other
words,
it
seemed
obvious
that
he
was
primarily
concerned
in
not
giving
a
written
statement.
if
he
was
taped,
wasn't
that
the
functional
equivalent,
equivalent
of
a
written
statement?
justice
jr.
he
was
willing
to
do
it
orally,
but
my
question
is
whether
or
not,
in
view
of
his
not
being
informed,
that
actually
he
was
misled?
