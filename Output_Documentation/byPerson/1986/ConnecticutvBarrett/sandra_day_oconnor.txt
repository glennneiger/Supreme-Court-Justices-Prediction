justice
o'connor
mrs.
dewey,
what
if
a
defendant
or
the
defendant
in
this
case
in
this
case
refused
to
sign
a
written
confession
because
of
a
belief
that
only
written
statements
could
be
introduced
in
evidence
against
him?
justice
o'connor
the
trial
court
would
have
to
determine,
would
it
not,
that
the
respondent
knowingly
gave
us
his
right,
understanding
that
the
statements
could
be
used
against
him?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
when
someone,
a
defendant,
makes
a
waiver
of
this
type
which
is
selective
or
perhaps
conditional,
that
that
suggests
that
there
may
be
some
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
about
what
statements
can
be
used
against
him?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
didn't
ask
or
suggest
that
it
was
ambiguous,
but,
does
it
possibly
suggest
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
how
the
statements
could
be
used?
justice
o'connor
mr.
genuario,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
why
the
waiver
here
could
he
considered
ambiguous.
it
seemed
perfectly
clear
on
its
face
that
counsel
was
requested
for
any
before
making
any
written
statement.
what's
ambiguous
about
that?
justice
o'connor
he
said,
"i'm
willing
to
speak
without
i
but
won't
sign
anything
in
writing
without
counsel.
"
now,
how
is
that
ambiguous?
i
can
understand
that
conceivable
there
might
be
some
question
about
his
knowledge
of
whether
the
oral
statements
could
he
used.
i
fail
to
understand
how
there's
any
ambiguity.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
genuario,
do
you
take
the
position
that
every
selective
or
conditional
waiver
of
miranda
such
as
is
in
this
case
constitutes
a
full
invocation
of
counsel
for
all
purposes?
justice
o'connor
it
sounds
like
that's
your
position,
that
there
just
can't
be
a
selective
waiver.
it
is
impossible
to
have
one,
under
your
view.
justice
o'connor
selectively?
what
are
the
magic
words
that
a
defendant
has
to
say
to
ask
for
counsel
only
for
a
written
statement?
