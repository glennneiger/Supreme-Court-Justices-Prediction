justice
scalia
excuse
me.
before
you
what
if
in
fact
he
had
been
under
the
misperception
that
anything
that
he
said
orally
couldn't
be
used
and
only
the
material
that
he
subscribed
to
in
writing
could
be
used.
then
what
would
the
result
be?
justice
scalia
well,
was
advised
and
he
said
he
understood
it,
but
in
fact
he
didn't
understand
it
if
he
thought
that
anything
he
said
orally
couldn't
be
used
against
him.
justice
scalia
you
are
saying
that
my
question
is
not
this
case?
justice
scalia
mrs.
dewey,
earlier
i
asked
you
about
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court.
are
the
trial
court's
findings
in
the
materials
before
us
anywhere?
justice
scalia
70
and
71
a,
thank
you.
justice
scalia
is
that
the
only
question
in
the
case,
mr.
genuario?
there
is
no
question
about
whether
your
client
understood
his
rights,
whether
he
understood
that
these
statements
could
be
used
against
him?
justice
scalia
if
he
asked
for
counsel,
it
may
go
to
that?
justice
scalia
you
didn't
argue
below,
did
you,
that
he
didn't
understand
his
rights?
justice
scalia
was
that
argued
before--
justice
scalia
--that
he
didn't
know
that
the
oral
statements
could
be
used
against
him?
justice
scalia
well,
he
said
more
than
that.
he
not
only
said,
"nothing
in
writing",
he
said,
"as
much
as
you
want
orally.
"
that
is
from
the
statements.
the
police
officer
says,
"he
indicated
to
me
that
he
would
not
give
police
any
written
statements
but
he
had
no
problem
in
talking
about
the
incident.
"
again,
"he
would
give
no
written
statement
to
the
police,
nothing
in
writing.
"
"however,
he
would
be
more
than
happy
to
talk
about
it.
"
"he
had
no
problem
with
that.
"
"he
said,
he
was
willing
to
talk
about
it
verbally
but
he
did
not
want
to
put
anything
in
writing.
"
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
12
different
times
in
the
record.
it's
very
clear
that
he
not
only
said
that
he
wouldn't
put
anything
in
writing,
but
he
repeatedly
said
he
would
converse.
justice
scalia
well,
what's
ambiguous
about
that?
justice
scalia
suppose
he
said,
"i'll
be
happy
to
talk
to
you.
"
"i
will
be
happy
to
give
a
written
statement.
"
"in
fact,
here.
"
he
writes
out
a
written
statement
and
he
signs
it.
however,
"as
soon
as
i
give
this
to
you,
i'm
tired,
i
want
to
see
counsel.
"
afterwards.
as
soon
as
he
says
that
magic
word
"counsel",
suddenly
everything
changes,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
but
why
is
that
any
more
absurd
than
the
argument
you
are
making?
all
he
did
was
mention
the
word
"counsel".
but
he
made
it
very
clear
to
all
the
officers,
"the
only
thing
i
want
counsel
for
is
a
written
statement.
"
"i'm
happy
to
talk
without
counsel.
"
justice
scalia
only
for
a
written
statement?
he
did
not
request
counsel
for
assistance
with
talking
with
the
police.
he
explicitly
said,
"i'll
be
happy
to
talk
to
you
without
counsel.
"
justice
scalia
that's
not
what
he
said.
he
said,
"i
will
not
give
a
written
statement.
"
i
don't
find
that
terribly
ambiguous.
he
would
not
give
a
written
statement
unless
his
attorney
was
present,
would
not
make
a
written
statement
until
his
lawyer
was
there.
justice
scalia
we
have
a
finding
of
understanding,
don't
we,
by
the
trial
court
and
no
finding
on
that
point
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
scalia
what
if
i'm
the
defendant
"i
want
to
talk
to
the
police.
"
"i
want
to
curry
favor
with
them.
"
"i
hope
that
by
getting
my
story
out
before
the
police
investigate
further
they
may
drop
the
whole
thing.
"
okay.
on
the
other
hand,
"i
want
to
be
able
to
change
my
story
and
i
think,
you
know,
things
that
are
in
writing
are
a
lot
more
impressive
on
the
jury.
"
and
what
not.
if
i
want
to
achieve
that
result,
how
do
i
do
it?
how
could
i
possibly
do
it
in
a
fashion
clearer
than
what
this
defendant
did?
i
mean,
beyond
telling
the
police,
"i'll
be
happy
to
talk
to
you,
indeed,
i
want
to
talk
to
you,
let
me
talk
to
you
but
i
won't
sign
anything
in
writing
until
i
have
counsel.
"
what
more
could
i
do?
justice
scalia
he
hasn't
said,
"i
want
counsel",
now.
he
hasn't
requested
counsel
in
that
sense
at
all.
you
say
he
requested
counsel.
he
hasn't
requested
counsel.
justice
scalia
if
he
gives
a
written
statement.
justice
scalia
and
you're
saying,
"if
i
want
an
attorney
for
a
written
statement,
i
have
to
have
an
attorney
for
everything.
"
even
though
i
say,
"i
don't
want
an
attorney
for
oral
statements?
"
