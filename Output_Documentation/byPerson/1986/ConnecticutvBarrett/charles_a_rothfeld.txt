mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
in
the
resolution
of
this
case
to
focus
on
precisely
what
went
on
and
what
the
findings
were
of
the
lower
courts,
because
i
think
that
frames
the
question
that's
presented
to
the
court
here.
the
first
point
to
make,
i
think,
in
that
regard
relates
to
questions
that
were
asked
by
justices
o'connor,
marshall
and
brennan
and
scalia
about
precisely
what
the
suspect
understood
he
was
doing
and
what
he
knew
about
his
rights.
i
think
it's
clear
on
the
record
here
that
respondent
testified
at
trial.
the
trial
court
expressly
found
that
he
understood
the
nature
of
his
rights,
he
understood
what
he
had
been
told
by
the
police,
and
that
understanding
of
course
included
the
statement
that,
"anything
you
say
can
and
will
be
used
against
you
at
trial.
"
that
factual
determination
was
nowhere
challenged
by
the
connecticut
supreme
court.
nothing
in
its
opinion
suggests
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
that
factual
finding
by
the
trial
court.
i
think
that
it's
also
important
to
recognize
that
there's
nothing
inherently
contradictory
between
an
understanding
of
that
right,
understanding
of
the
consequences
of
speaking,
and
the
course
of
action
followed
by
the
suspect
here
where
he
chose
to
make
an
oral
but
not
a
written
statement.
i
think
it
is
a
common
experience,
courts
have
frequently
recognized
that
people
simply
are
reluctant
to
put
things
in
writing
even
though
they
appreciate
that
their
oral
statements
have
legal
consequences.
this
court
encountered
something
very
similar
to
this
in
butler
versus
north
carolina,
where
a
suspect
refused
to
sign
a
waiver
statement
but
proceeded
to
waive
his
rights.
the
court
found
that
his
waiver
was
effective
because
not
the
necessary
inconsistencies,
so
long
as
he
appreciated
what
he
was
doing.
the
fact
that
he
didn't
make
a
sensible
distinction
in
his
actions
is
not
of
any
relevance
for
purposes
of
miranda.
courts
of
appeals
and
other
lower
courts
have
encountered
situations
almost
identical
to
the
one
involved
in
this
case
where
a
suspect
refuses
to
put
a
statement
in
writing,
refuses
to
sign
a
statement.
those
courts
have
recognized
that
suspects
frequently
are
simply
reluctant
to
put
statements
in
writing
even
though
they
fully
appreciate
the
nature
and
consequences
of
what
they
are
doing.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
in
those
cases
they
have
refused
at
least
on
some
occasions
to
sign
statements
without
the
advice
of
counsel.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
a
number
are
cited
in
our
brief,
justice
stevens,
but
i
cannot
tell
you
specifically.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
probably
the
typical
fact
pattern
is
the
suspect
simply
refuses...
says
something
to
the
effect
that,
"i
will
not
make
a
written
statement.
"
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
essentially
asserting
his
right
to
remain
silent
rather
than
his
right
to
request
the
presence
of
an
attorney.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
the
rationality
of
the
defendant's
decision
and
whether
or
not
he
appreciates
whether
or
not
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
the
action
that
he
took
and
his
understanding
of
his
rights.
i
think
the
observations
made
by
those
courts
that
people
in
fact
are
reluctant
to
put
things
in
writing
even
though
they're
aware
of
the
consequences
of
what
they're
doing--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
one
statement
to
make
at
the
outset
is
that
apparently
respondent
was
not
in
fact
trying
to
contact
his
attorney.
so,
whatever
the
police
may
have
thought
he
was
attempting
to
do--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
believe
there
was
testimony
to
that
effect
at
the
trial.
i
may
be
mistaken
about
that,
justice
stevens.
so,
i
think
the
understanding
of
the
police
is
not
of
any
relevance
to
whether
or
not
he
was
actually--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
i
should
say
something
also
about
the
factual
findings
of
the
lower
courts
here,
as
you
were
discussing
before.
first,
i
think
there
is
no
disagreement
between
the
two
connecticut
courts
in
this
case
as
to
what
respondent
understood
and
what
the
factual
setting
of
the
case
was.
the
courts
agreed
as
to
what
respondent
actually
said,
that
he
was
willing
to
make
a
statement
but
that
he
would
not
put
it
in
writing
until
his
lawyer
arrived.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
nowhere
attempted
to
overturn
any
of
the
factual
findings--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
what
the
connecticut
supreme
court
did,
your
honor,
was
accent
the
trial
court's
findings
about
what
occurred
and
went
on
to
make
legal
conclusion
about
the
significance--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
not
at
all.
but
i
think
that
what
that
statement
means,
justice
stevens,
is
a
factual
account
of
what
the
trial
court
did.
the
trial
court
found
that
he
had
requested
counsel
before
making
a
written
statement,
and
the
holding
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court
was
based
on
a
legal
conclusion
about
the
significance
of
the
request
that
the
respondent
made.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
found
that
when
the
suspect
stated,
"i
am
willing
to
speak
to
you
but
i
will
not
make
a
written
statement
until
counsel
arrives.
"
that
that
was
an
invocation,
a
legal
invocation
of
his
miranda
rights
within
the
meaning
of
edwards
versus
arizona.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
clearly
is
the
rule,
yes,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
indeed
it
is.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it's
the
rule
the
court
set
down
in
miranda.
i
think
the
fbi,
as
any
other
law
enforcement
agency,
must
follow
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
he
in
fact
requested
a
lawyer.
he
stated
that
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
speak
to
the
police
but
that
he
would
not
make
a
written
statement
without
the
presence
of
counsel.
but
he
had
no
objection
to
talking
to
the
police
before
counsel
arrived.
the
question
here
is
the
legal
significance
of
this
type
of
partial
invocation
of
miranda
rights.
now,
a
partial
invocation
is
just
that,
a
partial,
limited
invocation
and
nothing
more.
the
requirements
of
miranda
are
satisfied
if
the
inherently
coercive
effects
of
custodial
interrogation
are
dispelled
and
that
is
accomplished
by
advising
the
suspect
of
his
miranda
rights
and
honoring
whatever
decision
he
makes
about
whether
or
not
he
is
willing
to
speak
to
the
police,
make
a
statement.
if
the
suspect
freely,
voluntarily
chooses
to
invoke
his
rights
only
for
a
limited
purpose,
which
is
what
the
respondent
did
here,
and
he
then
proceeds
to
voluntarily
make
a
statement
to
the
police,
nothing
in
miranda
or
in
any
of
this
court's
other
decisions
would
prevent
him
from
doing
so
or
would
prevent
the
police
from
listening
to
what
he
has
to
say.
the
difficulty
with
the
connecticut
supreme
court's
decision
i
think
this
returns
to
justice
stevens'
reading
of
it
and
exactly
what
the
court
meant
to
hold
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
i
think
understood
the
meaning
of
miranda
to
be
that
any
time
a
suspect
recognizes
the
value
of
counsel
in
any
of
his
dealings
with
the
police,
that
all
questioning
must
come
to
a
halt
until
an
attorney
is
present.
but
this
idea
that
the
police
or
the
courts
have
some
obligation
to
safeguard
the
interest
of
the
suspect
more
fully
than
the
suspect
himself
thinks
necessary
or
wants,
if
completely
alien
to
miranda
which
was
designed
to
insure
that
it
is
the
person
who
is
being
interrogated
who
controls
whether
or
not
he
is
able
to
make
a
statement.
the
court
emphasized
that
its
holding
in
miranda
was
not
designed
to
make
interrogations
impossible.
it
was
not
designed
to
prevent
suspects
from
confessing.
and
the
miranda
rules
are
not
intended
to
insure
that
a
suspect
will
always
act
in
his
own
best
interest
or
will
always
make
the
wisest
possible
decision
when
he--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
that
was
the
actual
finding
of
the
trial
court,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
not
having
participated
in
the
proceedings
i
can't
give
a
personal
opinion,
but
i
think
we
have
to
accept
the
trial
court's
conclusion
that
he
understood
his
rights
and
nevertheless
preceded
to
talk.
he
testified
himself
at
trial
that
he
understood
those
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
respondent
was
told
here,
justice
marshall,
"anything
you
say
can
and
will
be
used
against
you.
"
he
was
told
that
four
times
and
each
time
stated
that
he
understood
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
as
i
was
suggesting,
there
are
these
two
types
of
reasons
the
suspect
may
rationally
make
that
distinction.
we
may
think
that
it
is
in
his
interest
to
try
to
talk
him
way
out
of
it,
but
that
he
is
reluctant
to
commit
himself
in
writing
because
if
he
wants
to
change
his
story,
it
would
be
more
effective
if
there
is
a
written
statement,
that
in
that
case
it
would
only
be
his
word
against
the
policeman's.
so,
there
are
all
kinds
of
entirely
rational
reasons
that
a
suspect
may
make
the
distinction.
the
suspect
amy
in
fact
be
right,
that
an
oral
statement
carries
less
weight
with
the
jury
than
a
written
statement.
and,
again
as
the
court
at
least
implicitly
recognized
in
butler
and
the
lower
courts
have
explicitly
recognized,
people
are
reluctant
to
put
things
in
writing
even
though
they
appreciate
that
their
oral
statements
have
legal
significance.
i
think,
given
the
fact
that
the
suspect
was
explicitly
warned
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
everything
he
said
could
be
used
against
him,
he
stated
that
he
understood
that,
the
trial
court
found
that
he
understood
that,
there
is
no
reason
for
anyone
to
second-guess
that
conclusion.
i
think
that...
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor--
