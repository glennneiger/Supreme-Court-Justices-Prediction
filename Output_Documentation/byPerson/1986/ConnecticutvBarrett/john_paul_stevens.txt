justice
stevens
mrs.
dewey,
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
because
you
referred
to
what
the
trial
court
found.
as
i
understood
the
appellate
court's
opinion,
it
treated
it
as
two
questions,
one
whether
he
invoked
his
right
to
counsel,
and
then
secondly
whether
he
waived
the
right.
the
only
question
you
present
in
your
cert
petition
goes
to
whether
he
invoked
the
right
to
counsel,
i
believe?
justice
stevens
and
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
said
that
the
trial
court
impliedly
found
that
the
defendant
had
requested
counsel,
and
then
they
point
out
in
a
footnote
that
that's
what
they
support
that
with
a
footnote.
now,
if
that's
true,
then
we
have
both
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
agreeing
that
there
was
a
request
for
counsel,
so
to
the
extent
there's
factual
question,
i
guess
they've
resolved
it
against
you,
haven't
they?
justice
stevens
we
should
a
appraise
we
should
look
at
the
trial
court's
finding
ourselves
and
not
accept
what
the
supreme
court
said
about
it
then?
justice
stevens
in
any
of
those
cases
was
the
refusal
accompanied
by
a
request
for
counsel
as
it
was
here?
justice
stevens
which
one?
can
you
cite
any
of
those?
justice
stevens
because
i
thought
this
case
was
a
rather
unusual
fact
pattern
myself,
but
you
say
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
just
like
it?
justice
stevens
correct,
so--
justice
stevens
--the
cases
in
which
he
says,
"i
won't
sign
until
my
lawyer
gets
here.
"
they're
rather
rare,
i
think,
aren't
they?
justice
stevens
what
do
you
say
about
the
supreme
court's
reference
to
all
the
phone
cells
and
the
failure
of
the
police
to
inquire
whether
he
was
trying
to
locate
his
lawyer
or
not?
justice
stevens
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
stevens
but
the
state
supreme
court
seemed
to
think
they
had
a
duty
to
find
out
whether
he
wanted
to
wait
for
his
lawyer?
justice
stevens
no,
but
isn't
it
correct
that
they
in
effect
treated
the
trial
court
as
having
held
that
there
had
been
an
intelligent
waiver
after
a
request
for
counsel,
whereas
and
they
treated
the
two
questions
separately,
and
that
issue
isn't
involved
here?
justice
stevens
well,
but
they
also
said,
the
trial
court
impliedly
found
that
the
defendant
had
requested
counsel.
do
you
think
we
should
just
ignore
that
statement?
