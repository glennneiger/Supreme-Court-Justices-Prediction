justice
marshall
do
you
is
there
any
explanation
for
the
fact
that,
"won't
make
a
written
statement
but
i
will
make
an
oral
statement,
other
than
you
can't
use
an
oral
statement?
"
"is
there
any
other
reason
he
would
have
made
the
statement
that
you
can
think
of?
"
justice
marshall
do
you
mean,
yet,
he
knew
that
the
officer
was
going
to
testify?
justice
marshall
well,
why
did
he
not
want
a
written
statement?
justice
marshall
but
he
didn't
have
the
slightest
idea
that
it
would
be
used
against
him?
justice
marshall
i
said,
so
you
think
he
had
any
idea
it
was
going
to
be
used
against
him
when
he
made
the
statement?
justice
marshall
well,
what
in
the
rights
that
he
was
read
said
that,
"don't
make
an
oral"
i
mean,
"don't
make
a
written
statement"?
justice
marshall
didn't
he
go
again
the
next
day?
justice
marshall
didn't
he
go
after
two
days
in
a
row?
justice
marshall
yes,
but
it
was
two
times,
two
separate
times?
justice
marshall
you
said,
standing
there,
that
they
save
him
four
warnings.
justice
marshall
well,
that
was
four
different
times.
justice
marshall
and
each
one
of
the
those
occasions,
he
had
no
idea
that
they
were
going
to
use
it
against
him?
justice
marshall
mr.
rothfeld.
justice
marshall
does
the
fbi
rule
still
say
that
if
a
prisoner
asks
for
a
lawyer
you
stop
questioning
him?
justice
marshall
you
said
what?
justice
marshall
that's
still
the
rule,
so
it's
a
good
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
once
a
man
asks
for
a
lawyer,
you
stop
questioning
him?
justice
marshall
and
this
time
you
questioned
him
four
times?
justice
marshall
do
you
agree
that
if
he
had
known
that
this
would
be
used
against
him,
he
would
have
continued
to
talk?
justice
marshall
i'm
asking
you.
justice
marshall
not
a
general
understanding
of
his
rights,
it's
a
particular
one
that,
"if
you
talk
to
this
officer
he
will
testify
against
you?
"
justice
marshall
but
he
also
said,
"i
won't
but
it
in
writing
but
i
will
talk.
"
justice
marshall
counsel,
wouldn't
you
be
much
better
off
if
he
had
testified
as
to
why
he
did
that?
i
mean
that,
"a
jailhouse
lawyer
told
me,
or
somebody
told
me?
"
justice
marshall
wouldn't
you
be
better
off?
justice
marshall
well,
you
can't
substitute
your
testimony.
justice
marshall
so,
wouldn't
you
be
better
off,
and
isn't
it
a
missing
point
in
your
case?
