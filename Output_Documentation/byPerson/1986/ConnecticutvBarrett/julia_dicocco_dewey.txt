ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
in
this
case,
william
barrett,
was
arrested
on
a
charge
of
sexual
assault.
shortly
after
his
arrest,
within
a
matter
of
hours,
he
was
given
four
separate
sets
of
miranda
warnings.
he
told
police
officers
that
he
had
no
problem
talking
about
the
incident,
but
he
would
not
give
a
written
statement
without
an
attorney.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
an
oral
statement
given
by
the
respondent
is
admissible
as
evidence
in
the
subsequent
criminal
trial.
as
i
just
indicated,
mr.
barrett
was
arrested
on
a
charge
of
sexual
assault.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
he
was
warned
in
accordance
with
miranda
versus
arizona.
he
was
then
transported
to
a
nearly
town.
upon
arriving
he
was
again
given
his
miranda
warnings.
he
received
a
third
set
of
miranda
warnings
prior
to
the
actual
interrogation.
the
connecticut
trial
court
and
the
connecticut
supreme
court
both
found
that
the
defendant
stated
he
had
no
problem
talking
to
the
officers
but
he
would
not
give
a
written
statement
without
an
attorney.
mr.
barrett
then
proceeded
to
give
a
narrative
account
of
the
incident,
admitting
that
he
and
his
co-defendant
had
intercourse
with
their
victim.
he
claimed,
however,
that
this
was
a
consensual
act,
despite
the
fact
that
during
the
act
he
had
in
his
hands
a
screwdriver.
the
police
had
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
tape
record
the
defendant's
first
statement.
in
an
effort
to
get
a
valid
tape
recording
of
this
statement,
they
once
again
advised
mr.
barrett
of
his
miranda
rights.
again
the
defendant
repeated
that
he
had
no
problem
talking
with
the
officers
but
he
would
not
give
a
written
statement
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
the
defendant
then
proceeded
to
give
a
narrative
account
paralleling
the
first
account.
at
trial
the
defendant
contended
that
his
two
statements
were
involuntary.
however,
at
the
conclusion
of
a
suppression
hearing
the
trial
court
held
that
the
defendant
had
made
a
knowing,
voluntary
and
intelligent
waiver
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
therefore,
the
two
statements
were
both
introduced.
on
appeal,
mr.
barrett
again
contended
that
the
statements
were
involuntary,
but
he
added
the
contention
that
the
statements
were
taken
in
violation
of
edwards
versus
arizona.
the
trial
court's
factual
finding
was
basically
not
challenged
by
the
connecticut
supreme
court.
instead,
that
court
held
that
the
defendant's
refusal
to
give
a
written
statement
without
an
attorney
present
was
a
clear
request
for
the
assistance
of
counsel
to
protect
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
in
reaching
this
conclusion
the
connecticut
supreme
court
never
considered
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
not
invoked
his
right
to
remain
silent
for
purposes
of
that
oral
interrogation.
thus,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
misconstrued
this
court's
holding
in
miranda
and
in
edwards.
this
court
has
consistently
made
it
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
miranda
warnings
is
to
dispel
that
coercion
that
is
inherent
in
police
interrogation.
additionally,
miranda
is
designed
to
assure
that
a
suspect
in
police
custody
is
adequately
advised
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights
prior
to
giving
any
statements.
custodial
interrogation
was
viewed
as
inherently
coercive.
however,
under
the
miranda
holdings,
holdings,
once
a
suspect
has
been
adequately
advised,
it
is
possible
for
a
trial
court
to
find
that
that
suspect
did
in
fact
waive
his
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination
and
that
waiver
was
an
act
of
free
will.
the
state
does
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
bright
line
if
a
defendant
does
request
counsel
at
the
interrogation.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
every
held
that
the
individual
knowledge
of
a
defendant
or
suspect,
a
knowledge
that's
not
communicated
to
the
police
officers,
would
have
any
bearing
on
whether
there
was
a
free
and
voluntary
act
by
the
defendant.
of
course,
at
a
suppression
hearing
that
would
become
a
factor
that
would
be
considered
by
the
trial
court.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
it
would
still
be
a
factual
determination
for
the
trial
court,
if
evidence
of
that
nature
came
before
the
trial
court
at
a
suppression
hearing.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
a
selective
or
conditional
waiver
has
never
been
held
to
be
an
equivocal
or
an
ambiguous
situation.
it
could
be
a
factor--
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
--under
the
facts
of
particular
case,
it
might
be
possible
theta
selective
waiver,
if
it
were
somehow
inherently
inconsistent,
could
suggest
a
lack
of
knowledge
or
could
suggest
that
the
defendant
did
not
truly
comprehend
his
miranda
rights.
but
again,
that
would
be
a
factual
determination
for
the
trial
court,
and
in
this
particular
case
the
determination
by
the
trial
court
was
that
that
waiver,
that
selective
waiver,
was
not
an
indication
of
an
indication
of
a
right
to
counsel
or
any
uncertainty,
but
rather
that
the
defendant
was
so
aware
of
what
his
rights
were
that
he
chose
to
exercise
some
of
the
rights
but
not
the
other.
he
chose
not
to
have
counsel
present
for
the
oral
aspect,
as
opposed
to
the
written
aspect
of
the
interrogation.
in
the
present
case
the
connecticut
supreme
court
applied
the
edwards
rationale
in
a
vacuum.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
the
result
should
be
same
as
was
held
by
the
connecticut
trial
court.
the
fact
that
the
defendant,
or
the
suspect,
hasn't
made
a
shrewd
choice
once
advised
of
his
miranda
rights
does
not
bar
the
subsequent
admission
of
that
statement
that
the
defendant
subsequently
makes.
an
ill-advised
choice,
an
ill
choice,
rather;
a
shrewd
choice,
a
choice
not
in
the
defendant's
interest
is
not
what
miranda
was
designed
to
protect.
miranda
was
just
designed
to
assure
that
the
defendant
was
in
fact
advised.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
but
in
the
present
case,
the
defendant
himself
testified
that
he
did
understand
the
miranda
rights
and
he
did
understand
that
what
was
said
could
be
used
against
him.
he
and
the
officers
had
also
testified
that
in
their
perception
the
defendant
understood
what
the
miranda
rights
entailed.
so,
in
this
case
there
is
no
question.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes,
it
is
part
of
the
miranda
warning,
a
warning
this
defendant
received
on
four
separate
occasions.
therefore,
in
this
particular
case
he
knew
that
his
actions,
his
oral
statement,
could
be
used
against
him
and
he
also
knew
that
for
purposes
of
his
oral
statement
he
had
the
right
to
have
an
attorney
present.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
oh,
no.
he
never
said
that
explicitly.
the
officer--
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
--the
nature
of
the
miranda
warnings,
plus
the
fact
that
the
officers
testified
that
upon
each
individual
right
they
asked
the
defendant,
"do
you
understand
this"?
"yes,
i
do".
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
"do
you
understand
what
i've
just
stated?
"
"i
believe
you
understand.
"
i
don't
believe
they
repeated
the
miranda
warnings.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
no,
i
don't
believe
that
they
used
those
exact
terms.
it
would
have
possibly
been
better
police
practice
but
they
did
not
use
those
exact
terms.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
there's
an
inconsistency
is
the
connecticut
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
regard,
where
they
state
that
the
trial
court
implied
found
that
the
defendant
had
requested
counsel.
what
they
are
doing
is
taking
the
trial
court's
holding,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
the
part
of
that
holding,
that
indicates
that
the
defendant
had
no
problem
talking
with
the
officers
but
would
not
put
anything
in
writing.
the
trial
court
and
that
was
all
that
the
trial
court
found
about
the
defendant's
asserting
the
right
to
counsel.
there
was
never
an
explicit
finding
by
the
trial
court
regarding
an
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
that
is
the
state's
position,
yes,
your
honor,
that
there
was
never
a
factual
finding
made
concerning
the
invocation,
and
because
there
was
never
a
factual
finding,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
by
applying
an
automatic
rule
whenever
the
word
"attorney"
is
mentioned,
was
in
error.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes
justice
marshall.
there
are
situations
where
naturally
people
are
reluctant
to
put
anything
in
writing
but
often
people
aren't
reluctant
to
put
talk
at
all.
they're
willing
to
say
whatever
comes
into
their
minds,
as
long
as
it
is
not
preserved--
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
--there
is
no
indication
that
he
knew
the
officer
was
going
to
testify
in
this
case.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
there
could
be
any
number
of
reasons
including
just
a
reluctance
to
put
anything
in
writing
which
would
not
be
dispositive,
or
the
fact
that
he
felt
more
comfortable
talking
about
the
incident.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
he
was
told
that
anything
he
said
could
be--
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
--one
would
have
to
presume
that
having
been
warned
four
times
that
if
would
be
used
against
him,
that
he
knew
that
that
statement
would
be
used
against
him.
additionally,
mr.
barrett
testified
that
he
understood
the
rights
as
given,
and
having
understood
the
rights
it
would
be
natural
to
conclude
that
he
knew
that
what
he
said
could
he
used
against
him.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
absolutely
nothing.
the
rights
didn't
talk
about
the
written
statement.
they
talked
about
the
oral
statement,
which
is
what
this
defendant
did
give.
had
there
been
a
written
statement
that
the
police
attempted
to
utilize,
then
of
course
that
written
statement
would
have
been
inadmissible.
that
was
the
right
that
this
defendant
had
invoked.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
excuse
me?
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
no.
it
was
all
part
of
one
process.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
only
because
the--
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
--within
a
matter
of
hours,
yes,
they
did.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes,
it
was,
because
of
four
different
situations
that
had
happened
between--
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
--one
would
have
to
assume
that,
having
been
advised
and
having
had
no
there
being
no
indication
that
he
didn't
comprehend,
that
he
did
know
that
they
would
be
used
against
him.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
it's
not
a
matter
of
record
that
the
respondent
was
informed
that
they
were
attempting
to
tape
record
it.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes,
they
did?
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
they
tried
twice
to
tape
it
and
within
a
matter
of
days
they
did
reduce
the
narrative
statement
to
writings,
yes.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes,
they
did
use
their
written
noted
to
reflect
their
recollection.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes,
if
he
had
known
that
they
were
attempting
to
tape
record
it,
would
he
have
been
more
reluctant
to
give
an
oral
statement.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
but
it
was
also
obvious
in
this
case
that
he
wanted
to
tell
the
police
officers
his
version
of
the
events
in
order
to
possibly
exculpate
himself
from
any
involvement
in
the
sexual
assault.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
i
don't
believe
he
was
misled
in
this
situation.
the
police
didn't
do
anything
that
was
over-reaching
or
coercive
in
this
regard.
and
the
mere
fact
that
a
conversation
would
have
been
tape
recorded
wouldn't
have
been
dispositive.
it
would
have
been
a
matter
for
consideration,
to
see
whether
there
had
been
a
knowing,
voluntary
but
it
was
not
a
dispositive
factor.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes,
they
are.
they're
on
the
joint
appendix
on
pages
70
and
71
a,
i
believe.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
yes,
they
are.
in
essence,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
refused
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
there
had
been
a
waiver
of
rights,
and
whether
that
waiver
of
rights
had
been
an
act
of
free
will.
we
agree
that
a
request
for
counsel
must
be
narrowly
construed,
but
here
the
connecticut
trial
court
ignored
the
clear
tenor
of
the
defendant's
own
request,
giving
a
talismanic
quality
to
the
word
"attorney".
this,
in
effect,
engrafted
an
additional
prophylactic
rule
upon
this
court's
miranda
mandate.
this
unwarranted
expansion
of
federal
law
created
obstacles
to
legitimate
waivers
and
to
legitimate
choice
by
defendants.
it
thus
restricted
interrogation
in
ways
not
contemplated
by
the
miranda
decision.
for
that
reason,
the
opinion
of
the
connecticut
supreme
should
be
reversed
and
the
trial
court
decision
affirmed.
thank
you.
ms.
julia
dicocco
dewey
just
briefly,
your
honor.
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
given
control
over
the
course
of
his
interrogation.
he
was
given
a
choice
by
the
police
officers,
and
the
police
officers
respected
that
choice.
my
opponent
suggests
that
what
the
defendant
did
in
this
case
was
give
an
ambiguous
statement,
and
that
that
ambiguity
that
he
alleges
mandates
a
presumption
that
there
has
been
invocation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
but
that
is
a
factual
question
that
was
never
reached
by
any
of
the
courts
below.
he
is
relying
upon
a
factual
determination
that
was
never
made
by
the
trial
court
or
by
the
connecticut
supreme
court.
instead,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
applied
a
bright
line
rule:
any
time
the
word
"attorney"
is
mentioned,
it
is
automatically
an
invocation
of
a
right
to
counsel.
they
reached
that
determination
without
a
factual
basis,
and
therefore
their
decision
should
be
reversed.
