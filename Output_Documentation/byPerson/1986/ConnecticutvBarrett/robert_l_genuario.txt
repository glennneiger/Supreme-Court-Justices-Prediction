mr.
robert
l.
genuario
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
case
at
bar,
like
the
case
in
smith
versus
illinois,
deals
with
the
threshold
inquiry
that
is
mandated
by
this
court's
decision
in
edwards
versus
arizona,
and
that
threshold
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
the
accused
in
the
first
instance
has
invoked
his
right
to
counsel.
if
the
accused
has
not
invoked
his
right
to
counsel,
then
this
court
should
reverse
and
remand.
if
the
accused
has
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
in
the
first
instance,
then
under
the
standards
set
forth
in
edwards,
in
smith
versus
illinois,
in
michigan
versus
jackson
most
recently,
there
could
no
waiver
of
that
right
to
counsel
unless
there
was
a
cessation
of
the
interrogation
and
then
further
discussions
and
conversations
were
initiated
by
the
defendant.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
understood
his
rights
and
understood
that
his
oral
statements
could
be
used
against
him
bears
on
a
decision
that
this
court
might
make
in
finding
whether
his
request
for
counsel
was
ambiguous
or
not.
the
statements
that
he
made,
on
their
face,
are
ambiguous
and
give
rise
to
questions
about
his
understanding.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
we
did
argue
on
appeal,
and
i
would
like
to
correct
both
the
solicitor
general's
office
and
attorney
dewey.
it
is
not
a
situation
where
the
trial
court
found
no
where
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
found
no
difference
with
the
trial
court's
opinion.
rather,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
decided
that
it
did
not
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
voluntary,
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
because
as
a
matter
of
law
he
had
invoked
his
right
to
counsel.
so,
we
didn't
even
have
to
get
into
that
issue
of
the
voluntariness
and
the
intelligence
of
his
waiver.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
that
was
argued
before
the
conecticut
supreme
court--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--the
trial
court
found
that
there
had
been
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
reversed
the
trial
court.
we
claimed
in
the
connecticut
supreme
court
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
failing
to
take
into
consideration
certain
factors.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
never
had
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
i
think
there
is
quite
a
bit
ambiguous
about
it,
your
honor,
and
the
ambiguity
arises
on
two
levels.
in
the
first
place
it
is
ambiguous
as
to,
under
what
circumstances
the
defendant
is
willing
to
speak
without
counsel.
the
defendant
said--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--well,
if
i
might,
your
honor,
the
defendant
did
not
say
that,
"i
will
not
sign
a
statement.
"
the
defendant
did
say
that,
"until
my
attorney
arrives
i
will
make
no
written
statement.
"
"nothing
in
writing"
was
the
testimony
of
officer
cameron.
i
think
the
question
is,
in
relation
to
the
ambiguity,
what
do
those
words
mean?
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
question--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--well,
let
me
illustrate
it
this
way.
if
we
asked
ten
wallingford
police
officers
what
mr.
barrett
meant
by,
"nothing
in
writing
but
i'll
be
happy
to
talk
about
it;
i
have
no
problem
in
talking
about
it.
"
i'm
sure
those
ten
wallingford
police
officers
would
say
that,
"nothing
in
writing
and
no
written
statement.
"
in
that
context
means
that,
"we
won't
take
out
a
particular
form
and
we
won't
have
mr.
barrett
write
cut
a
statement
and
we
won't
have
mr.
barrett
sign
that
statement.
"
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
asked
ten
19
or
20-year
old
individuals
who
had
no
prior
dealing
with
the
police,
as
in
the
case
of
my
client,
that
what
the
words
"nothing
in
writing"
mean,
i
suggest
that
they
would
say,
"it
means
you're
not
going
to
write
down
what
i
say.
"
i
might
emphasize,
one
of
the
arguments
that
attorney
dewey
gave
during
oral
argument
was
one
of
the
reasons
somebody
would
make
that
distinction
is
because
he
wouldn't
want
his
statement
preserved.
i
suggest
that
the
ambiguity,
"nothing
in
writing",
deals
with
the
basis
upon
which
the
very
fundamental
basis
upon
which
the
defendant
was
willing
to
speak
with
the
police.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
well,
i
think
the
issue
goes
further
than
that.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
certainly,
your
honor.
in
that
situation,
i
think
that
the
statements
would
still
be
excluded
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
he
has
expressed
affirmatively
a
desire
for
assistance
of
counsel.
there
are
two
questions
here.
one
is
whether
it
was
ambiguous,
and
two,
whether
it
was
selective--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--it
does
on
the
first
level,
your
honor,
but
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
that
justice
marshall
has
asked,
doesn't
it
imply
that
he
doesn't
understand
the
distinction
and
that
therefore
the
reason
he
wants
counsel,
and
the
request
for
counsel.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
on
the
contrary,
your
honor.
the
position
that
we
take
is
fairly
straightforward
position,
that
if
the
defendant
has
affirmatively
requested
counsel,
and
not
just
in
any
setting
but
the
setting
where
he's
dealing
with
the
police
and
he
wants
counsel
to
assist
him
in
dealing
with
the
police,
that
under
edwards
all
we're
asking
is
that
the
police
step
back
for
a
moment.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
well,
nothing
in
any
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
a
conditional
request
for
counsel
is
not
an
invocation
of
that
right.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
i
don't
think
i'm
asking
for
any
additional
rules
to
be
added
on.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
an
accused
in
custody,
in
dealing
with
the
police,
requests
counsel
that
under
edwards
it
requires
the
cessation
of
interrogation.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
your
honor,
we
are
not
making
the
argument
that
counsel
is--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--he
requested
counsel
for
assistance
with
the
police.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
and
therein
lies
a
very
basic
ambiguity
in
the
situation
in
which
he
wanted
counsel.
he
wanted
counsel
to
keep
his
statement
from
being
written
down.
he
wanted
counsel
to--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--again,
i
believe
that
a
common
man's
interpretation
of
"nothing
in
writings"
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
statements
were
not
to
be
written
down,
and
i
think
that
the--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--if
the
request
is
in
the--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--nothing
we're
saying
would
countermand
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
edwards,
which
says
that
a
defendant
can
in
fact
waive
his
right
to
counsel.
but
before
he
does
that--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--there
are
no
magic
words,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
the
request
that
the
individual
makes
has
to
be
looked
at
in
each
and
every
case.
but
the
issue,
of
course,
is
whether
he
wanted
counsel
to
assist
him
in
his
dealings
with
the
police.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
well,
in
that
hypothetical--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--we
might
be
better
off,
depending
on
what
he
said
in
his
testimony.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
absolutely
not,
and
i
wouldn't
try
to.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
well,
if
in
fact
if
in
fact
there
were
some
evidence
to
the
effect
further
evidence
to
the
effect
of
a
lack
of
understanding,
that
certainly
would
be
a
stronger
case
for
us.
but--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--we
have
a
finding
by
the
trial
court
and
no
finding
by
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
but
the
issue
before
this
court
deals
with
a
balancing,
a
balancing
of
the
interest
in
a
right
to
counsel
versus
the
legitimate
interest
in
interrogation
by
law
enforcement
officials.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
i
think
it
is
a
straightforward
application
of--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--well,
the
question
that
this
court
has
to
decide
is
under
what
circumstances--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--what
i'm
suggesting
is--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
the
question
that
i'm
asking
this
court
to
decide,
or
the
question
that
i
think
is
before
this
court,
is
when
does
someone
invoke
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
i
think
it
means
i
think
it
certainly
deals
with
an
interpretation.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
well,
i
think
that
our
reasoning
follows
from
miranda,
and
i
think
it's
consistent
with
edwards.
matter
of
fact,
perhaps
the
best
factual
pattern
is
a
reading
of
the
facts
in
edwards,
but
we've
been
talking
about
a
conditional
waiver.
but
in
the
edwards
case,
the
defendant
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
this
supreme
court
found
that
he
had
in
fact
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
by
using
the
words,
"i
do
not
want
to
make
a
deal
until
my
attorney
arrives.
"
this
court
expressly
found
that
that
was
an
invocation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
rather
than
our
approach
being
a
novel
approach,
the
novel
approach
is
to
say
that,
having
requested
counsel
in
dealing
with
the
police,
we
can
now
back
away
from
our
holding
in
edwards
to
the--
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
--no,
i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
ingrained
in
the
edwards
case.
similarly,
in
oregon
versus
bradshaw,
the
statement
made
by
the
defendant
in
invoking
his
right
to
counsel
is,
"i
would
like
to
have
counsel
before
this
goes
much
further.
"
what
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
is
that
if
we
too
narrowly
construe
request
for
counsel,
then
the
ease
with
which
that
right
can
be
circumvented
becomes
too
apparent.
and
indeed
the
facts
in
this
case
the
facts
in
this
case
are
illustrative
of
that,
"i
will
not
make
a
written
statement.
"
and
then
we
attempt
to
tape
record
it.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
i
think
that
when
a
defendant
requests
counsel
in
a
situation
like
that,
then
he
has
requested
counsel
and
unless
after
a
cessation
of
interrogation
he
comes
back
to
the
police,
there
can
be
no
waiver.
this
is
not
an
absolute,
for
all
time,
"i
won't
talk
to
the
police.
"
holding.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
he
has
indicated
a
need
to
have
an
attorney
assist
him.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
genuario
there's
no
claim
that
subsequently
he
could
not
waive
that
right.
but
there
is
a
claim
that
at
that
point,
at
that
point
the
interrogation
should
cease
because
it's
more
important
it's
more
important
that
that
special
right
to
counsel
be
protected
at
that
point
than
we
continue
with
the
interrogation.
he
can
waive
it.
he
can
waive
it,
but
there
has
to
be
a
time
period
in
which
he's
given
a
little
more
room,
and
that's
all
we're
saying.
that's
all
we're
saying.
your
honors,
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
think
i
will
conclude
there.
thank
you.
