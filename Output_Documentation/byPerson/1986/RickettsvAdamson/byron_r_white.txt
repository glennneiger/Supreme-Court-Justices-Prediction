justice
white
well,
what
if
the
agreement
had
just
right
out
said
he
would
testify
as
often
as
necessary
against
these
people,
if
they
are
convicted
after
the
first
trial
and
appeal
successfully
he
will
testify
at
the
second
trial?
let's
suppose
the
obligation
he
undertook
was
very
plain
and
then
he...
there
was
a
reversal
of
the
conviction
and
then
he
refused?
justice
white
well,
he
just
refused
to
testify
and
refused
to
perform
a
contractual
obligation.
do
you
say
that
just
automatically
is
a
waiver
of
his
double
jeopardy
right?
justice
white
no,
no,
my
example
is,
he
says,
"i
will
testify
against
these
people
as
often
as
necessary.
"
justice
white
and
then,
then
after
the
reversal
he
says,
"yes,
i
know
i
promised
that
i
would
testify
again
but
i'm
not
going
to
now.
"
"i
just
refuse.
"
"i
know
i
am
breaching
my
agreement
but
here
i've
been
in
jail.
"
"you
can't
retry
me.
"
"that's
double
jeopardy.
"
justice
white
well,
the
agreement
didn't
say
that.
all
it
said
was
what
his
obligation
was.
justice
white
even
if
he
hadn't
been
sentenced
and
spent
time
in
jail?
justice
white
so,
you
say
that--
justice
white
--didn't
he...
i
guess
he
did
plead...
he
pled
guilty
to
the
lesser
offense
before
there
was
any
trial
of
these
other
people?
justice
white
he
pled
guilty?
justice
white
he
pled
guilty
and
suppose
then
after
pleading
guilty
to
the
offense,
suppose
that
he
then
refused
to
testify
at
all,
even
once?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
well,
he
did...
from
a
refusal
to
perform
his
contractual
duty,
you
would
say,
is
equivalent,
you
would
say,
to
a
waiver
of
double
jeopardy?
justice
white
suppose
we
found
that,
and
you
would
say
weren't
wrong
then?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
wasn't
the
conviction
when
he
pled
guilty?
