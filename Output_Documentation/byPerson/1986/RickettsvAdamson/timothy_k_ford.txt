mr.
timothy
k.
ford
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
most
certainly
does
involve
a
double
jeopardy
issue.
mr.
john
adamson
was
in
prison
serving
the
second
year
of
a
prison
term
for
the
murder
of
don
bolles
when
he
was
charged
with
the
murder
of
don
bolles.
now,
the
issue
here
arises
at
an
unusual
context.
the
context
has
to
do
with...
and
begins
with
an
agreement
between
attorneys
and
a
disagreement
over
what
the
terms
of
that
agreement
were.
like
most
such
disagreements,
it
arose
because
something
happened
that
nobody
anticipated
when
the
agreement
was
entered
into.
what
everybody
anticipated,
when
the
agreement
was
entered
into,
is
that
mr.
adamson
would
plead
guilty.
he
would
tell
the
state
who
else
was
involved
in
this
murder.
he
would
testify
against
those
people
and
he
would
testify
against
others
involved
in
other
crimes
and
at
the
conclusion
of
that
testimony
he
would
be
sentenced
and
after
that,
in
a
separate
provision
of
the
agreement,
it
said
he
would
be
transferred
from
pima
county
sheriff's
custody
into
a
different
form
of
custody
which
turned
out
to
be
federal
witness
protection
program
custody.
mr.
adamson
did
plead
guilty.
he
did
solve
this
crime
for
the
state
of
arizona.
he
did
testify
against
these
other
people,
and
not
just
once
or
twice
or
five
times
or
ten
times,
but
he
counted
14
times,
31
days,
190
hours,
in
court,
205
he
counted
and
it
is
undisputed,
interrogative
sessions
outside
of
court.
he
waived
his
rights.
now,
that
includes
some
occasions
after
the
breakdown
of
the
plea
agreement
where
he
continued
to
voluntarily
cooperate
with
federal
authorities
in
this
matter.
what
happened
that
was
not
anticipated
was
that
after
the
state
sentenced
mr.
adamson,
and
he
was
sentenced
after
he
testified
in
all
those
cases
and
everybody
was
convicted,
and
after
he
was
transferred
into
federal
custody
one
of
the
convictions
was
reversed.
it
was
reversed
on
a
ground
that
required
mr.
adamson's
immunity
agreement
to
be
renegotiated
because
the
state
for
some
reason,
and
it's
not
in
the
record...
and
i'm
at
a
disadvantage
here
because
i
have
to
stick
to
the
record
that's
before
this
court,
and
of
course
there
has
never
been
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
these
questions
and
i
was
not
counsel
at
this
stage...
but
for
some
reason
the
state
refused
to
give
mr.
adamson
immunity
as
to
a
receiving
stolen
property
crime
that
involves
selling
an
illegal
suit
that
got
tied
up
in
this
set
of
facts.
because
of
that
he
took
the
fifth
amendment
and
there
was
cross
examination
limitations
during
the
dunlap
and
robison
trials,
and
that
was
why
their
cases
were
reversed.
so,
when
that
happened
everybody
knew
that
there
had
to
be
further
negotiations
between
mr.
adamson
and
the
state
because
that
changed
his
situation.
mr.
schafer
said
so
in
the
newspaper,
and
mr.
adamson
read
that.
mr.
adamson's
counsel
said
so,
and
in
fact,
there
were
negotiations.
they
started
discussing,
what
are
the
terms
and
mr.
adamson's
position
and
his
lawyer's
position
was,
"we
have
performed.
"
"we
have
testified
time
and
time
and
time
again.
"
"we
have
been
sentenced.
"
"we
have
been
transferred.
"
"our
part
of
the
bargain
has
been
completed.
"
"so
for
further
testimony,
we
want
further
considerations.
"
primary
in
his
mind
was
safety.
this
is
an
extremely
volatile,
dangerous
case
involving
allegations
of
organized
crime
and
governmental
corruption,
and
mr.
adamson's
safety
was
placed
in
the
record
by
mr.
schafer
as
the
reason
why
they
couldn't
find
a
place
for
him
in
the
state
of
arizona
and
had
to
transfer
him.
for
his
own
safety,
is
what
mr.
schafer
said
back
then.
mr.
adamson's
lawyers
took
a
tough
position.
in
mr.
adamson's
words
in
that
letter
of
april
3rd,
he
asked
for
the
moon.
that
was
their
position
in
negotiations.
he
said
it
may
have
been
untutored,
but
it
was
in
good
faith
because
in
that
letter
he
never
said,
"i
repudiate
this
agreement.
"
"i
want
to
go
back.
"
"i
want
this
to
be
undone.
"
he
said,
"this
is
how
we
read
this
agreement.
"
or
his
lawyer
said
this.
"this
is
what
we
agreed
on
when
we
entered
this
agreement,
that
we
would
testify
and
then
we
would
be
sentenced,
and
that
has
been
done
and
now
there
has
to
be
additional
consideration
and
here
is
the
consideration
that
we
demand.
"
he
did
not
say,
and
it
is
important
to
remember
the
context
that
we
are
in
here
of
negotiations
between
attorneys,
and
frankly
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
meeting
on
april
2nd.
we
have
a
footnote
regarding
the
reference
to
april
9th.
we
know
nothing
about
any
such
meeting.
there
has
never
been
an
allegation
of
any
of
those
two
things
happening.
again,
we
have
a
problem
here.
there
has
never
been
an
evidentiary
hearing.
but
i
know
nothing
of
those.
the
question
that
has
been
raised,
and
what
i
understand
to
have
happened,
is
there
was
this
call
on
april
2nd
and
the
response
was
this
letter.
and
the
letter
did
not
say,
john
harvey
adamson
hereby
refuses
to
testify
in
any
further
cases,
signed
william
feldhacker.
the
letter
said,
here's
our
legal
position.
here
is
how
we
construe
the
agreement.
here
are
the
additional
items
of
consideration
we
wish
in
addition
to
testimony,
and
if
you
find
that
there
is
an
absolute
prohibition
to
any
of
these
we
can
anticipate
that
mr.
adamson
will
not
testify
in
any
future
trials.
now,
that
is
bargaining.
that
is
negotiating
position.
that
is
not
a
breach
of
the
plea
bargain
agreement.
the
plea
bargain
agreement
never
said
anywhere,
you
will
not
write
a
letter,
you
will
not
assert
a
position
through
counsel.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
i
think
it
is
an
inartful
letter
asking
for
negotiations,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
both
sides
in
this
case,
if
they
were
at
this
point
the
negotiations
broke
down,
and
i
think
partly
because
of
these
kind
of
miscommunications
between
counsel.
the
position
mr.
schafer
has
described
his
response
as
taking...
of
trying
to
get
mr.
adamson
to
go
along.
it's
not
how
mr.
adamson
said,
and
his
counsel
have
placed
on
the
record,
that
they
interpreted
it,
they
interpreted
it
as,
"you
have
already
breached",
and
that
is
how
the
solicitor
general
read
it
in
their
brief
here
in
this
court
and
that
is
how
i
read
it.
"we
may
now
prosecute
you.
"
"you
are
subject
to
prosecution.
"
therefore,
then,
mr.
adamson
did
not
refuse
to
testify,
or
did
not
testify
at
this
pretrial
hearing.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
important
for
me
to
differentiate,
i
think
throughout
this,
the
contract
questions
and
the
waiver
questions
and
the
syllogism
that
mr.
schafer's
argument
proceeds
with,
which
says
he
agreed,
if
he
breached,
he
would
be
reprosecuted.
he
breached;
therefore
he
can
be
reprosecuted.
what
that
does
is
just
substitute
one
legal
conclusion
for
another.
the
legal
conclusion
of
breach
is
not
what
leads
to
the
legal
conclusion
of
waiver.
what
the
plea
agreement
said
is,
if
he
should
refuse
to
testify
then
the
agreement
is
null
and
void
and
he
may
be
reprosecuted.
the
only
time
in
all
these
years
mr.
adamson
refused
to
testify
was
in
those
proceedings
before
judge
myers
after
the
state
had
said,
"you
are
already
in
breach.
"
"we
are
going
to
prosecute
you
for
all
these
things.
"
mr.
adamson's
lawyers...
when
mr.
adamson
refused
he
did
not
refuse
in
the
sense
of
saying,
"well,
whatever
the
court
says,
i
am
not
going
to
say
another
word.
"
"i
am
standing
on
my
fifth
amendment
privilege.
"
indeed,
judge
myers
did
at
first
go
along
with
the
state's
argument
and
say,
"mr.
adamson,
you
have
to
testify.
"
"i'm
ordering
you
to
testify.
"
and
then
what
happened
was,
he
did
not
defy
the
court
or
the
agreement.
his
lawyer
stood
up
and
said,
"just
a
minute,
judge
myers,
please
let
me
explain
to
you
what
has
happened
here.
"
and
he
explained
this
chronology
and
he
showed
the
letter
that
mr.
schafer
had
written
that
had
threatened
and
said
that
he
was
subject
to
reprosecution
then.
and
he
said,
"in
light
of
this
and
in
light
of
our
position
the
plea
bargain
agreement
has
been
satisfied,
we
believe
we
have
no
double
jeopardy.
"
--or,
i'm
sorry,
"self-incrimination
protection".
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
that
letter
does
not
constitute
a
refusal
to
testify.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
if
you
say--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
want
ten
million
dollars
for
my
testimony
and
if
you
don't
give
it
to
me
we
can
anticipate
that
i
won't
be
testifying.
that
is
a
posturing.
that
is
an
attempt
to
try
and
achieve
something
through
a
very
tough
negotiating
position,
but
it
is
not
an
absolute
refusal
to
testify.
he
was
not
called
into
court
and
asked
a
question
and
said,
"i
refuse
to
testify".
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
i
think
the
agreement
contemplated
that
he
could
be
reprosecuted
if
he
refused
to
testify.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
that's
correct.
but
justice
scalia...
i
mean,
saying,
"when
you
call
me
into
court
next
week
i
don't
think
i
am
going
to
testify
unless
you
pay
me
ten
million
dollars.
"
is
not
a
refusal
to
testify.
even
in
contract
law
it
is
not.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
under
the
restatement,
no.
under
the
vast
majority
of
state
laws,
my
understanding
is
no.
this
kind
of
a
statement
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
nowhere
in
the
law
is
treated
as
a
breach
of
the
contract
and
certainly
not
one
that
permits
and
relieves
the
state
from
all
of
its
obligations.
this
is
not
just
a
situation...
if
this
had
happened
in
the
commercial
media
where
somebody
had
ordered
1,000
widgets
and
900
were
delivered
and
then
there
was
a
dispute
among
their
lawyers
over
whether
the
additional
hundred
had
to
be
delivered,
one
side
could
never
say
even
if
they
were
proven
right
that
the
other
hundred
was
owing,
"we
get
all
our
money
back,
we--
"
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--well,
under
the
law
of
anticipatory
breach
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
person
says,
"unless
you
come
up
with
$300
we
can
anticipate
that
on
the
due
date
for
these
widgets
i
am
not
going
to
deliver.
"
that
is
not
treated
as
a
breach
by
most
courts.
but
remember--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--it
is
very
close
to
a
refusal,
but
it
is...
again,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
are
talking
in
a
context
of
agreements
between
lawyers
and
discussions
between
lawyers,
where
lawyers
can
take
and
disagree
over
their
position
without
forfeiting
all
their
client's
rights.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
without...
well,
let
me
retreat
from
the
position
and
point
out,
because
i
do
not
want
to
get
fixed
to
this
question
of
whether
or
not...
i
mean
the
state,
the
important
thing
is,
i
guess,
if
this
is
a
breach,
i
think
as
your
question
earlier
to
mr.
schafer
pointed
out,
mr.
roberts,
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
arizona
conceded
in
the
ninth
circuit
this
wasn't
a
breach.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
perhaps
you
are
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
at
least
it
indicates
that
a
reasonable
person
with
some
knowledge
of
this
case
and
the
law
could
believe
that
mr.
adamson
could
write
that
letter
or
his
lawyers
could
write
that
letter
without
breach.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
of
course
it's
not...
again
the
question
is
not
breach.
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
whether
in
the
context
of
this
agreement
mr.
adamson
committed
an
action
that
constitutes
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
which
clearly
had
attached
to
him.
now,
in
order
to
even
get
to
this
question,
of
course
we
have
to
say,
a
waiver
can
occur
through
counsel.
we
have
to
say
that
the
obligations
of
the
contract
were
so
clear
that
by
taking
this
position
that
he
was
making
a
waiver--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--well,
dinitz
and
scott,
as
i
understand
them,
involve
a
different
double
jeopardy
interest.
and
what
this
court,
i
think
has
emphasized
to
be
a
secondary
double
jeopardy
interest
and
that
is
the
interest
in
continuing
before...
or
completing
the
trial
before
a
single
fact
finder.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
this
court
certainly
said,
i
believe
in
dinitz
itself,
that
this
is
not
the
same
as
the
central
common-law
basis
for
the
double
jeopardy
clause
which
are
the
three
common-law
pleas
and
one
of
those
is
what
is
involved
in
here.
the
french,
and
my
french
is
awful...
autrefois,
convict.
that
is
mr.
adamson's
plea
and
it
is
the
center
and
the
core
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
that
he
is
relying
on
for
protection
here,
not...
he's
not...
again
although
those
cases
say,
we're
not
analyzing
this
in
a
waiver
term,
that
of
course,
that
whole
line
of
authority
arose
out
of
the
green
case
where
the
state
was
arguing
and
based
on
some
19th
century
precedent
that
this
is
a
waiver.
the
court
refused
to
inject
that
body
of
law
against
the
defendant.
but
even
if
you
take
the
court's
terms,
and
i
have
looked
at
all
these
cases,
jefferson,
scott,
dinitz,
and
they
talk
about
voluntary
choice
and
the
defendant's,
deliberate
election
and
indeed,
they
are
all
absolutely
accurate
in
my
mind.
the
defendant
in
those
cases
chose
to
have
exactly
the
consequence
that
he
got.
he
said,
"i
want
to
have
another
trial.
"
"i
want
this
trial
suspended
and
to
try
again.
"
or
he
said,
"i
want
to
vacate
my
plea.
"
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
justice
scalia,
i
hate
to
split
this
hair,
but
it's
a
critical
hair
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
and
that
is,
he
did
not
agree
that
if
he
should
breach
he
could
be
retried.
he
agreed
that
if
he
refused
to
testify
he
could
be
retried.
and
that
is
a
different
thing,
and
that
is
the
difference
between
a
state
law
question
in
this
case
and
a
federal
law
question
in
this
case.
now,
with
regard
to
that
agreement
the
ninth
circuit,
i
think,
was
absolutely
correct
when
they
said
there
is
no
way
to
read
the
plea
agreement
itself
as
a
waiver
of
double
jeopardy
because
it
only
says,
if
something
happens
in
the
future
then
a
consequence
can
occur
that
implicitly
waives
double
jeopardy,
if
you
read
everything
against
mr.
adamson.
now,
there
is
no
explicit...
there
were
many
constitutional
rights
listed
there
and
they
didn't
put
that
one
in.
the
reason
they
didn't
put
that
one
in
is
because
they
didn't
think
he
was
going
to
be
sentenced
until
everything
was
over.
what
happened
was,
he
was
sentenced
and
he
thought
everything
was
over
and
the
other
side
thought
it
was
not,
with
the
exception
of
this
ashford
plumbing
thing.
at
that
point
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
have
a
defendant
sign
kind
of
a
contract
of
adhesion
that
says,
"i
agree"...
perhaps
that's
the
wrong
phrase.
i'm
not
a
contract
lawyers.
but
you
can't
have
a
defendant
say,
"by
entering
into
this
agreement
we've
got
you;
now
you've
waived
your
double
jeopardy
rights.
"
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
there
is
a
question
of
voluntariness
in
the
future.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
it's
a
waiver
that
involves
two
different
event.
even
if
you
imply
the
waiver,
which
this
court
refused
to
do
in
menna
versus
new
york,
the
implied
waiver
only
occurs
with
first,
the
signing
of
the
agreement
and
then
the
later
event.
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
the
later
event
has
to
be
voluntary.
you
couldn't...
this
court
would
not
entertain
a
situation
where
if
mr.
adamson
was
unable
to...
was
hospitalized
and
was
unable
to
get
to
the
courthouse
the
state
could
say,
"he
refused
to
testify
and
it
says
in
here
he
has
failed
to
testify.
"
that
kind
of...
there's
got
to
be
a
voluntariness.
if
we're
going
to
allow
these
kind
of
agreements
to
supplant
constitutional
rights,
they
can't
take
away
the
basic
essence
of
those
constitutional
rights
and
the
loss
of
them.
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
think
there
absolutely
was.
they
could
have
written
into
the
agreement,
either
as
they
did,
it
will
be
over
at
sentencing
or
if
the
defendant
is
sentenced
prior
to
any
testimony
then
he
agrees
to
waive
double
jeopardy
with
regard
to
any
later
refusals
to
testify.
then,
they
would
have
had
exactly
the
same
agreement
and
that's
what...
in
fact,
that's
what
the
state
of
arizona
does
now.
there
is
a
reported
case
which
we
have
cited.
that
is
what
prosecutors
do
all
over
the
place.
it
is
a
very
simple
thing
to
do.
it
avoids
misunderstandings
and
that
is
what
we
had
here.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
it
has
been
our
position
from
the
beginning,
at
least
arguendo,
i
think,
justice
white,
that
if
he
were
with
clear
knowledge
that
he
was
in
breach
to
have
done
an
act
that
the
agreement
said
clearly
was...
waived
his
double
jeopardy
rights--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--again,
i
am
having
difficulty
with
the
contract
language.
i
think
the
language
is
important
because
the
contract
question
is
separate
from
the
federal
question.
but
if
the
agreement
said,
"i
hereby"...
in
the
clearest
terms...
"i
hereby
waive
my
double
jeopardy
rights
and
agree--
"
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--and
i
agree
that--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--if
the
agreement
says,
"under
those
circumstances
i
agree
i
can
be
retried.
"
then
i
think
that
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
don't
see
how...
the
loss
of
federal
constitutional
rights
doesn't
follow
automatically
from
any
breach
of
contract.
that
is
why
i
think
the
contract
question--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
am
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
guess
i
don't
understand.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
i
am
sorry.
that
is
the
part
i
didn't
understand,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
present
plea
agreement
language
is
in
there
that
says
he
may
be
reprosecuted
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--unless
there
is
something
in
the
plea
agreement
that
either
implicitly
or
explicitly
waives
double
jeopardy--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--if
what
is
in
this
plea
agreement
was
in
the
plea
agreement
in
the
situation
that
justice
white
has
described,
we
would
say
that
a
waiver
could
be
found
under
those
circumstances,
and
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
could
be
found.
if
he
actually
went
into
court
and
did
what
he
had
promised--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--if
he
has
waived
the
double
jeopardy
right.
i
have
not
taken
the
position
in
this
case,
which
the
tenth
circuit
has
taken,
and
if
it
is
not
necessary,
certainly
for
the
court
to
reach
the
question
in
this
case
that
double
jeopardy
can
never
be
waived.
the
ninth
circuit
was
very
clear
in
saying
that
their
holding
was,
even
if
it
can
be
waived.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
it
certainly
was
not
here.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
it
was
mid-trial,
mid-jury
selection,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
yes.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
right
at
that
moment?
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
number
one,
again,
of
course,
it
could
be
construed
as
a
waiver
of
double
jeopardy
under
the
same
circumstances
and
should
be.
number
two,
though--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
do
not
say
they
are
equivalent
to.
i
say
that
from
the
language
in
this
contract
the
court
could
under
those
circumstances
find
a
waiver
but
that
breach--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--found
that
with
regard
to
a
waiver
under
those--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--circumstances,
i
would
say
you
were
not
wrong.
at
least
i
could
concede
that
arguendo
for
this
case.
there
is
a
difference.
let
me...
perhaps
one
illustration
can
explain
it.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
that's
a
good
question.
i
think
that,
as
i
understand
double
jeopardy
law
now
from
reading
dinitz
and
the
cases
that
have
gone
over
the
history
of
it
and
the
interests
involved,
i
think
that
double
jeopardy
does
not
attach
until
in
a
guilty
plea
situation,
there
is
a
sentence.
i
think
that
really,
implicitly,
that
is
what
is
held
by
ohio
versus
johnson,
that
you
can't
just
say
guilty
now,
double
jeopardy;
that
there
has
to
be
more
that
implicates
the
core
principles
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
that
the
sentencing
does
that,
certainly
under
arizona
law
and
the
understanding
of
the
parties
here,
the
sentencing
did
that.
so,
the
double
jeopardy
question...
the
contract
question,
for
example
in
this
case,
the
contract
protected
mr.
adamson
from
prosecution
for
a
number
of
other
crimes.
the
federal
constitution
did
not
because
jeopardy
had
not
attached
as
to
those
crimes.
after
this
breakdown
in
the
arizona
supreme
court's
holding
he
was
prosecuted
and
given
lengthy
prison
sentences
for
those
other
crimes.
we
have
raised
no
double
jeopardy
objection
to
those
because
that
was
a
separate
question.
that
was
a
state
law
contract
question.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
there
was
one
case
left,
justice
stevens,
and
that
involved
this
ashford
plumbing
case.
what
happened
was,
just
before
they
went
down
to
sentencing
mr.
schafer
and
mr.
adamson's
lawyers
got
together
and
mr.
schafer
said,
well,
i
want
you
to
understand
we
may
still
call
you
for
ashford
plumbing.
mr.
martin
feldhacker
said,
mr.
adamson
that
and
that's
why
the
statement
was
made
on
the
record
that
was,
and
of
course
that's
the
statement...
that's
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
found
was
the
binding
agreement,
not
the
plea
agreement.
they
found
there
was
ambiguity
in
the
plea
agreement
clarified
by
this
colloquy,
but
what
they
didn't
know
is
that
counsel
had
had
an
out
of
court
discussion
in
which
they
said,
"we're
talking
about
one
case,
ashford
plumbing,
and
that's
what
we're
agreeing
to.
"
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
the
day
after
sentencing.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
the
last
one
never
has
taken
place.
it
has
never
been
prosecuted.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
no,
it
was
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
wasn't
there.
that
was
their
understanding
and
that
is
our
position
now,
that
that
was
what
the
agreement
meant.
the
arizona
supreme
court
again,
in
construing
this,
they
never
said,
"oh,
no,
this
contract
means
he
doesn't
have
to
testify.
"
or,
"he
does
have
to
testify
for
sentencing.
"
this
says,
well,
maybe
there
is
an
ambiguity
created
by
paragraph
8,
if
you
read
their
statement.
but
then
look
at
this
colloquy,
and
they
relied
on
the
colloquy
to
establish
this
ongoing
obligation.
counsel
knew
and
mr.
adamson
knew--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--it
pertained
to
the
one
case
and
that's
what
mr.
schafer
said.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
being
asserted
as
a
shield
by
a
defendant
who
said,
"i
have
testified.
"
"i
have
testified
truthfully.
"
"many
people
have
gone
to
prison.
"
"i
have
endangered
myself.
"
"i
have
done
what
i
was
obligated
to
do,
and
then
took
perhaps
an
extreme
position
in
trying
to
get
something
more
in
advance
of
the
state's
request
for
more.
"
but
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
i
believe,
must
give
him
some
assurance
that,
having
done
that,
having
fulfilled
his
obligations
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
and
belief
and
to
his
counsel's
knowledge
and
belief,
and
having
been
sentenced
and
sent
to
prison
for
this
crime,
that
at
some
point
there
is
an
end.
the
state
cannot
continue
to
demand
from
him
more
and
more
and
more
or
at
the
least
when
they
do,
he
has
the
right
to
object
and
to
say,
"no,
this
is
not
my
obligation.
"
"this
is
my
position
and
it's
a
different
one
from
yours.
"
without
fear
of
losing
everything
and
letting
the
state
keep
all
the
benefits
of
its
bargain
and
all
the
people
in
prison
that
he's
testified
against
and
him
and
his
admission
of
guilt
and
give
him
nothing
and
indeed
in
this
case,
take
his
life.
thank
you
very
much.
