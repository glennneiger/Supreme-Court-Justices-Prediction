justice
blackmun
in
the
meantime
he
had
been
sentenced?
justice
blackmun
why
did
the
state
rush
to
judgment
on
the
sentence?
justice
blackmun
don't
you
normally
wait
until
all
the
litigation
is
concluded?
how
did
you
know
you
might
not
get
reversed
on
the
pending
appeal?
justice
blackmun
well,
it
seems
to
me
there
ought
to
be
a
place
in
the
great
state
of
arizona
where
you
could
have
safe
incarceration.
justice
blackmun
where
are
dunlap
and
robison
now?
justice
blackmun
he
is
free?
justice
blackmun
well,
what
does
apply
if
zerbst
doesn't,
scott?
justice
blackmun
well,
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
but
because
i
think
that
is
what
u.s.
versus
scott
said
specifically.
hence,
i
am
asking
you
whether
you
are
content
with
the
scott
standard.
justice
blackmun
all
this
could
be
avoided
had
you
not
had
him
sentenced,
couldn't
it?
justice
blackmun
you
are
speaking
now
of
the
april
1980
agreement?
justice
blackmun
do
you
feel
that
was
a
breach
of
the
agreement?
justice
blackmun
well,
i
thought
it
was
conceded
that
it
was
not
one.
justice
blackmun
well,
if
it
is
conceded,
why
are
we
bothering
with
it
up
here?
