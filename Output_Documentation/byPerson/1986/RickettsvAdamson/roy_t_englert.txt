mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
need
in
this
case
for
a
knowing,
intelligent
and
voluntary
waiver
of
double
jeopardy
rights
above
and
beyond
that
which
is
clearly
contained
in
the
plea
agreement
itself.
indeed,
in
scott
this
court
has
held
that
when
it
is
the
defendant's
action
that
brings
about
the
need
for
successive
prosecution,
concepts
of
waiver
need
not
be
invoked.
the
court's
decisions
in
the
appeal
cases
and
the
mistrial
cases
have
not
rested
on
waiver
rationale.
to
take
another
concrete
example,
in
jeffers
the
defendant
objected
to
the
government's
attempt
to
have
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
and
conspiracy
counts
all
joined
in
one
trial.
when
he
failed
in
that
effort,
he...
i
am
sorry,
when
he
succeeded
in
that
effort
he
surely
was
not
entering
into
a
johnson
v.
zerbst
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
of
his
right
not
to
be
free
of
double
jeopardy,
because
it
wasn't
until
this
court's
decision
in
jeffers
that
it
was
clear
whether
cce
and
the
underlying
conspiracy
were
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses.
nonetheless,
this
court
held
that
because
of
the
defendant's
action
it
was
appropriate
for
him
to
be
tried
separately
on
the
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses
in
that
case.
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
defendant
can
breach
his
plea
agreement
but
nevertheless
prevent
charges
from
being
reinstated
as
the
plea
agreement
said
they
would
be,
on
the
grounds
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
automatically
prevents
reinstatement.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
most
certainly
would,
your
honor.
to
take
this
case
as
an
example,
if
what
the
defendant
had
done
had
been
to
file
some
kind
of
a
motion
for
clarification
before
judge
birdsall
or
before
any
other
appropriate
court
in
arizona,
saying
a
legitimate
disagreement
about
the
meaning
of
this
agreement
has
arisen,
i
cannot
imagine
that
a
state
court
would
find
pursuing
that
route
to
be
a
breach
of
the
plea
agreement.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
should
think
not,
your
honor.
i
should
think
it
would
not
suffice.
and
i
might
add
word
about
what
exactly
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
adamson
did
not...
mr.
adamson's
counsel
did
not
write
a
letter
saying,
"we
have
a
disagreement
about
this.
"
"let's
work
it
out.
"
the
letter
of
april
3rd,
1980,
which
is
reprinted
at
pages
106
to
110
of
the
joint
appendix,
stated
mr.
adamson's
refusal
to
testify
unless
his
non-negotiable
demands
were
met.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
speaking
of
the
april
30,
1980
letter
from
mr.
adamson's
counsel.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
was
not
at
the
argument
before
the
ninth
circuit.
i
understand
it
may
in
fact
have
been
conceded
at
that
point.
but
i
think
if
you
look
through
the
pleadings
that
the
state
filed--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that
concession
was
mistaken,
and
that,
i
believe,
is
made
clear
starting
with
the
letter
of
april
9th,
1980
from
the
state
and
continuing
through
six
years
of
proceedings
in
state
courts,
federal
habeas
courts.
it
certainly
has
been
the
state's
position
that
the
april
3rd
letter
was
breached.
there
was
a
preceding
conversation
on
april
2nd
which
was
reconfirmed
by
that
letter
of
april
3rd,
in
which
mr.
adamson
refused
to
testify
unless
his
non-negotiable
demands
were
met.
that
is
shown
by
the
very
first
sentence
in
mr.
adamson's
counsel's
letter.
that
refusal
to
testify
on
april
2nd
was
a
breach
of
the
agreement.
mr.
schafer's
letter
of
april
9th
reflects
another
conversation,
a
conversation
which
defendant
now
denied,
to
be
sure,
but
nothing
else
in
the
record
shows
any
denial.
that
april
9th
conversation
appears
to
be
a
breach
of
the
agreement.
it
was
not
mr.
adamson's
position
that
this
was
a
disagreement
that
needed
to
be
gotten
before
a
court
as
quickly
as
possible.
indeed,
mr.
adamson
resisted
the
state's
attempt
to
get
the
agreement
construed.
on
page
86
of
the
joint
appendix
there
is
a
very
clear
statement
by
mr.
adamson's
counsel
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
that
mr.
adamson
has
never
asked
any
court
to
construe
this
agreement.
his
position
was
that
he
did
not
want
the
agreement
construed,
and
as
mr.
schafer
suggested
in
his
argument,
the
timing
of
the
dunlap
and
robison
retrials
is
critical
to
take
into
account
in
terms
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
month
of
may,
1980,
when
this
action
was
being
brought
before
the
arizona
supreme
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
there
really
is
no
double
jeopardy
issue
in
this
case,
and
despite
the
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit,
respondent's
brief
doesn't
place
most
of
its
effort
in
an
attempt
to
say
that
there
is
any
real
double
jeopardy
issue
in
this
case.
their
position
is
that
there
is
something
special
and
unusual
about
this
case,
that
somehow
it
was
fundamentally
unfair
for
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
to
find
the
breach
it
did
in
this
case
because
there
was
just
a
good
faith
disagreement
and
as
soon
as
it
got
resolved
mr.
adamson
was
willing
to
testify.
first
of
all,
i
don't
know
what
federal
constitutional
issue
that
raises.
at
best,
in
some
extreme
case,
there
might
be
an
argument
that
an
insupportable
state
finding
of
breach
violated
due
process,
but
this
is
not
that
case.
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
record
that
mr.
adamson
refused
to
testify
unless
his
demands
were
met.
the
agreement,
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
made
clear
his
obligations.
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court,
the
first
time
they
had
heard
this
case,
found
the
interpretation
of
the
agreement
to
be
eminently
reasonable,
and
we
submit,
correctly
so.
we
think
that
this
case
was
summed
up
extremely
well
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
1981,
the
first
time
it
considered
this
precise
issue.
as
the
court
said,
on
page
161
of
the
joint
appendix,
"in
his
written
refusal
to
testify,
and
list
of
demands,
adamson
acknowledged
that
he
ran
the
risk
of
reprosecution
for
first
degree
murder
under
the
terms
of
the
plea
agreement.
"
"he
cannot
now
claim
immunity
in
what
proved
to
be
a
losing
gamble.
"
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
