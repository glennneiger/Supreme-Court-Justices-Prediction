chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schafer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
schafer.
mr.
schafer,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
schafer,
if
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
had
come
out
the
other
way
in
construing
adamson's
plea
bargain,
you
would
concede,
i
suppose,
that
what
he
said
was
correct?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
if
he
hadn't
breached
his
plea
then
he
was
entitled
to
have
the
government
perform
too?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
as
i
understand,
what
he
says
is
that
as
soon
as
he
got
the
final
word
from
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
on
their
construction
of
it,
he
offered
to
restore
matters
to
the
status
quo
ante
as
best
he
could.
do
you
disagree
with
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so,
you
say
he
construed...
and
i
am
not
saying
you
are
wrong,
but
you
say
he
construed
the
agreement
at
his
peril,
so
to
speak,
like
most
other
contracting
parties
do.
it
you
are
wrong
in
the
eyes
of
the
court,
there
is
the
final
say,
you
have
breached?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
do
you
agree
that
there
must
be
a
voluntary
waiver?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schafer.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
englert.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ford.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
sentence
before
that,
mr.
ford,
he
said,
"i
would
like
to
advise
you
that
the
demands
outlined
above
are
basically
non-negotiable
demands.
"
that
doesn't
sound
like
a
letter
asking
for
negotiations.
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
person
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
treat
a
contract
as
breached
upon
that
statement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
supposing
the
seller
delivers
the
1,000
widgets
and
says,
"i
know
the
agreed
price
was
$200
but
i
now
want
$300
for
them.
"
i
think
the
buyer
under
the
law
of
anticipatory
breach
can
refuse
and
say,
"you
have
breached".
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we
are
not
bound
by
concessions
made
in
the
ninth
circuit.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
it
may
indicate,
but
certainly
we
evaluate
for
ourselves
what
is
before
us.
we
are
not
bound
by
concessions
made
by
parties
in
another
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
need
a
waiver
in
this
case,
mr.
ford?
certainly
cases
like
dinitz
and
scott
say
that
where
a
retrial
occurs
as
a
result
of
something
the
defendant
did
the
waiver
doctrine
doesn't
apply?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
secondary.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
you
answer
justice
white's
question
for
me
if
you
won't
answer
it
for
him?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
question
is,
if
the
agreement
said,
"i
will
testify
over
and
over
again
as
long
as
necessary.
"
he
testifies
once,
he
is
sentenced,
the
cases...
the
dunlap
case
is
reversed
and
the
robison
case,
the
state
says,
"come
on,
perform
your
duty.
"
he
says,
"i
know
that's
what
the
contract
says
but
i
refuse.
"
there
is
nothing
more
than
the
present
plea
agreement
has
in
there
about
double
jeopardy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
simply
says,
"i
will
testify
as
often
as
necessary.
"
and
then
he
just
refuses
and
he
says,
"and
by
the
way,
you
can't
retry
me
because
i
have
been
in
jail
and
i've
already
been
convicted.
"
you
know,
that
old
french
phrase--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
say
what's
in
this
plea
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
ford.
mr.
schafer,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schafer.
the
case
is
submitted.
