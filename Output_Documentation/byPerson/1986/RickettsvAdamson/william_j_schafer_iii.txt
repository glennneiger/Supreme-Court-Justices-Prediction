mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
arizona
can
prosecute
john
adamson
for
the
crime
it
dismissed
when
it
entered
into
a
plea
bargain
with
him
after
he
breached
the
plea
agreement.
as
we
were
selecting
the
jury
to
try
mr.
adamson
for
the
murder
of
don
boiles,
he
struck
a
bargain
with
the
state.
he
would
testify
in
four
different
cases
in
return
for
a
sentence
of
48
to
49
years.
if
he
refused
to
testify
or
refused
to
be
interviewed
in
reference
to
preparation
for
trial
in
this
specific
instance
in
any
of
these
cases,
the
agreement
was
void
and
he
would
be
subject
to
the
original
charge.
adamson
testified
in
three
of
the
four
cases.
one
was
the
murder
of
don
boiles.
on
his
testimony
dunlap
and
robison
were
convicted.
when
their
convictions
were
reversed
on
appeal
in
march
of
1980,
adamson
refused
to
testify
at
their
retrials.
he
wrote
us
a
letter--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--yes,
he
had
been,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
wouldn't
classify
it
a
rush
to
judgment,
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
this,
although
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
i...
we
were
concerned
as
to
the
problems
not
sentencing
him
would
raise.
this
was
a
unique
case
in
many
ways.
one
of
the
unique
features
about
it
is
that
mr.
adamson
all
during
the
time
he
was
testifying
up
until
the
time
of
sentencing
had
been
in
local
custody
which
was
really
a
county
jail.
that
facility,
as
most
county
facilities
in
the
state
of
arizona,
are
not
really
adequate
for
holding
anyone
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
it
was
our
consideration
that
we
should
get
on
with
sentencing
mr.
adamson
so
that
he
could
get
into
federal
custody
as
he
finally
did.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
we
did
not
know
that,
your
honor.
we
also
did
not
know
how
long
that
appeal
would
take
and
we
were
considering
more
than
one
case
in
this
regard.
we
also
did
not
know
how
long
the
appeals
would
take
in
the
other
cases,
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
problem
that
we
could
see
about
the
incarceration
itself.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
it
was
more
than
safety,
your
honor.
i
believe
safety
was
a
factor,
but
it
was
also
expense
and
it
was
also
inconvenience
for
not
only
the
jailor
but
the
jailee,
and
all
those
were
a
consideration
in
our
minds.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
mr.
robison
is
still
in
prison
on
a
different
charge.
mr.
dunlap
is
out.
he
is
not
in
prison.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
he
is.
mr.
adamson
wrote
us
a
letter
saying
he
would
not
testify
unless
we
made
additional
concessions.
we
told
him
that
we
would
not
make
more
concessions
and
that
his
refusal
was
a
breach
of
the
agreement
which
reinstated
the
original
charge
which
included
a
possible
death
sentence.
we
tried
to
force
him
to
testify
but
he
refused
and
we
re-filed
the
original
charge.
he
attacked
that
re-filing
unsuccessfully
in
the
xx
court
immediately,
and
then
with
a
special
action
in
the
arizona
supreme
court,
arguing
in
both
instances
that
the
re-filing
was
barred
by
double
jeopardy
principles.
we
then
did
two
things.
we
filed
a
response
to
the
special
action
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
urging
that
court
to
construe
the
agreement
and
determine
whether
he
had
breached
it,
and
then
we
also
filed
a
motion
in
the
trial
court
seeking
to
have
dunlap's
retrial
continued
because
it
was
just
a
week
away.
after
those
two
convictions
were
reversed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court,
those
cases
were
separated
although
they
had
started
out
as
one
case.
so,
what
we
were
facing
were
two
retrials,
one
for
dunlap
and
one
for
robison.
the
first
one
was
set,
as
i
said,
just
a
week
away
was
the
retrial
for
mr.
dunlap.
the
same
day
that
we
did
these
two
things,
adamson
moved
to
withdraw
his
petition
for
special
action.
he
later
said
in
one
of
his
federal
habeas
corpus
pleadings
that
he
did
that
when
it
became
clear
to
him
that
the
question
of
his
breach
might
be
decided
by
the
arizona
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court
refused
to
dismiss
his
petition.
they
set
the
matter
for
a
hearing
and
dunlap's
pending
trial
was
stayed.
it
was
now
clear
what
adamson
was
trying
to
do.
he
was
trying
to
delay
a
judicial
determination
of
whether
he
had
breached
the
agreement
until
after
the
dunlap
trial
started,
with
no
resolution
of
that
question,
and
the
jury
seated
in
the
dunlap
trial.
if
we
wanted
to
pursue
dunlap,
we
would
have
no
choice
but
to
accede
to
adamson's
demands.
the
only
other
choice
would
be
to
forget
adamson
as
a
witness
and
dismiss
the
cases
against
both
dunlap
and
robison,
and
adamson
was
betting
that
we
would
not
do
that.
adamson
lost
in
the
arizona
supreme
court.
they
decided
that
the
plea
agreement
included
retrials
and
that
adamson
had
breached
the
agreement
and
they
reinstated
the
original
information.
that
was
on
thursday.
the
stay
of
dunlap's
trial
was
lifted
on
friday,
the
following
day,
and
his
trial
was
set
for
the
following
monday.
our
attempts
at
negotiation
with
adamson
were
not
successful,
and
without
him--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
we
decided
that
we
did
not
have
john
adamson
as
a
witness,
we
moved
to
dismiss
the
cases
against
dunlap
and
robison,
and
dunlap's
was
dismissed
on
that
monday,
the
day
set
for
trial.
adamson
then
was
tried
and
convicted.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
on
appeal
by
the
arizona
supreme
court.
he
then
went
into
federal
court
with
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
we
could
not
prosecute
mr.
adamson
on
the
original
charge
because
of
the
lesser
included
offense
rule
of
brown
versus
ohio,
and
secondly,
that
adamson
did
not
waive
his
double
jeopardy
rights.
we
believe
that
the
circuit
court
was
wrong
on
both
of
those
counts.
first,
the
circuit
court
drew
its
own
conclusions
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
plea
agreement
and
adamson's
letter
to
us.
it
should
not
have
done
that,
as
that
was
a
question
for
the
arizona
courts.
that
was,
we
contend,
a
matter
of
arizona
law
and
it
was
composed
of
determinations
on
factual
issues,
both
things
which
are
commonly
set
aside
for
decision
by
a
state
court,
and
once
made,
entitled
to
great
deference
and
as
to
factual
issues
in
a
habeas
corpus
case,
a
presumption
of
correctness.
if,
then,
the
finding
of
the
arizona
court
that
adamson
breached
his
plea
agreement
is
accepted,
the
next
question
is
whether
anything
prevented
prosecution
on
that
original
charge.
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
brown
versus
ohio
prevented
the
prosecution
but
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
correct.
as
this
court
noted
in
jeffers
versus
united
states,
there
are
exceptions
to
the
brown
lesser
included
offense
rule.
one
of
those
exceptions
is
where
the
defendant
asks
for
two
trials,
or
where
his
deliberate
actions
result
in
two
trials.
in
this
case,
adamson's
deliberate
breach
resulted
in
two
trials
and
he
knew
that
would
be
the
result
of
his
breach
for
he
had
agreed
to
that.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
he
did
not
raise
it.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
we
have
not,
your
honor.
we
find
it
curious
but
we
have
not
raised
it
in
the
petition.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
as
this
court
noted
in
jeffers,
there
are
exceptions
to
the
brown
lesser
included
offense
rule,
and
as
i
say,
one
of
those
is
where
the
defendant
himself
asks
for
two
trials
or
where
his
deliberate
actions
force
two
trials.
in
this
case
adamson's
breach
resulted
in
those
two
trials
and
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
think
i
would
have
to,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
if
they
had
ruled
that
way.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
don't
disagree
with
what
he
did.
i
think
i
would
phrase
it
a
little
differently
than
you
did.
it
wasn't
as
best
he
could.
what
he
said
was,
we'll
go
back
to
the
original
plea
agreement
and
there
is
not
much
question.
we
said
no,
we
cannot
do
that.
we
cannot
go
back
to
the
agreement
that
you
just
breached.
we
tried
to
come
up
with
an
agreement
that
would
allow
us
to
trust
mr.
adamson,
and
we
could
not
construct
such
an
agreement.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
perhaps
my
question,
the
word
"construe"...
i
think
he
just
took
a
position,
"this
is
it.
"
"we
are
not
going
to
testify.
"
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
think
we
have
to
concede,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
a
federal
question
as
to
whether
double
jeopardy
was
waived.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
your
honor,
i
see
that
quite
clearly
and
that's
a
factual
determination,
as
to
what
were
the
terms
of
the
agreement
which,
if
i
liken
to--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--i
wouldn't
concede
that,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
is
a
factual
question
as
to
what
the
agreement
actually
said.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
don't
believe...
well,
in
that
kind
of
a
scenario
i
believe
i
would
have
a
problem
and
so
would
the
court
in
that
regard.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
but
i
don't
believe
this
court
can
go
back
over
to
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
already
done,
which
is
supported
by
the
record.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
your
honor,
it
was
just
for
the
purpose
of
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
do
want
to
argue
to
this
court
that
johnson
versus
zerbst,
for
instance,
which
is
played
throughout
the
briefs,
really
does
not
apply
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
i
would
make
two
arguments
in
answer
to
both
of
those
questions
in
johnson
versus
zerbst,
although
it
has
been
argued
at
length
before
we
even
got
to
this
court.
i
do
not
believe
that
johnson
versus
zerbst
would
require
anything
different
than
what
we
have
here.
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
johnson--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
said,
and
i
think
the
two
cases
are
tateo
and
dinitz,
if
i
recall,
that
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
and
i
liken
it
to
this
where
there
is
a
retrial
after
reversal,
that
the
considerations
that
go
into
johnson
versus
zerbst
really
do
not
apply
and
perhaps
they
should
not
apply
in
this
situation.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
believe
i
would
be,
your
honor,
and
my
argument
is
that
johnson
versus
zerbst
really
should
not
apply
here
because
there
are
other
considerations
that
this
court
has
to
have
in
mind
and
they
could
not
be
fulfilled,
i
think
in
most
of
the
cases,
if
we
were
to
apply
a
johnson
versus
zerbst
theory
to
this
and
require
that
there
be
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
by
the
defendant.
however,
if
this
court
is
to
say
that
johnson
versus
zerbst
applies,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
record
is
quite
clear
that
mr.
adamson
knew
exactly
what
he
was
doing.
there
is
a
very
lengthy
plea
taking
by
judge
birdsall,
which
as
i
recall
is
about
35
pages,
where
this
is
discussed
with
mr.
adamson,
the
plea
agreement.
in
fact,
every
one
of
the
paragraphs
in
the
plea
agreement
is
discussed
and
at
the
end
of
that,
and
all
through
it,
he
indicates
that
he
knew
exactly
what
he
was
doing.
i
believe
this
case
is
more
like
ohio
versus
johnson
in
that
mr.
johnson
pleaded
to
two
of
four
counts.
the
argument
was
raised
that
the
lesser
included
offense
rule
came
into
play
and
double
jeopardy
barred
it,
and
this
court
said
no,
that
that
is
not
true.
underlying
the
double
jeopardy
principle
is
a
realization
that
there
are
few
hard
rules
that
can
be
drawn,
and
that
the
solution
in
each
case
lies
more
in
an
analysis
of
the
respective
interests
involved.
adamson
had
an
interest,
in
seeing
to
it
that
the
state
did
not
prosecute
him
repeatedly
for
the
same
crime.
he
also
had
an
interest
in
retaining
control
over
whether
his
guilt
would
be
determined
at
one
sitting
before
one
tribunal.
he
has
not
been
denied
either
of
those
interests.
we
have
not
prosecuted
him
repeatedly
and
he
retained
control
over
the
course
his
trial
would
take,
giving
up
that
control
when
he
entered
into
the
plea
agreement.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state's
interest
is
in
seeing
to
it
that
we
have
an
opportunity
to
marshal
our
forces
and
present
our
case
against
john
adamson.
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
denies
us
that
opportunity
and
it
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
it
may
well
have
been.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
the
agreement
was
that
mr.
adamson
would
testify
in
four
cases.
he
testified
in
three.
paragraph
8
of
the
plea
agreement
concerning
the
sentencing
was
gone
over
by
judge
birdsall
at
the
plea
taking
of
mr.
adamson,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
much
question
that
the
explanations
of
mr.
adamson,
the
explanation
to
his
attorneys,
and
nothing
was
said
controverting
that,
was
that
this
provision
was
in
the
agreement
to
get
around
the
requirement
of
the
state
of
arizona
that
you
must
be
sentenced
within
30
days
of
the
plea.
at
page
24
of
the
joint
appendix
that
you
have
before
you,
that
is
exactly
what
judge
birdsall
says.
it
reads,
paragraph
8
and
it
says,
"you
have
a
right
to
be
sentenced
within
30
days.
"
and
that's
what--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--your
honor,
i
hearken
back
then
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
findings.
i
believe
there
is
no
question
in
their
opinion,
and
this
was
specifically
argued
at
the
oral
argument
before
the
arizona
supreme
court,
the
paragraph
8.
they
said,
and
i
quote
to
you...
this
is
from
page
113...
"if
item
8
specifically
appears
to
limit
the
availability
of
the
petitioner
for
additional
testimony,
the
foregoing
exchange.
"
--and
that
was
the
exchange
at
the
sentencing
itself
about
he
has
to
come
back--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
--they
do
not
discuss
paragraph
18.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
i
think
a
reasonable
reading
of
that
provision
is
that
simply
when
he
is
sentenced
he
is
going
to
go
into
federal
custody.
there
was
a
reason
for
the
federal
custody.
no,
and
i
don't
think
a
reasonable
reading
of
that
would
be
that
his
obligation
is
totally
finished.
it
is
much
like
the
paragraph
number
8,
which
says
he
will
be
sentenced
at
the
completion
of
his
testimony
in
these
cases.
that
is
what
the
