justice
stevens
mr.
ford,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
agreement
because
you
are
getting
into
the
other
crimes
now
which
are
one
of
the
things
that
interests
me.
in
paragraph
8
of
the
agreement
it
says
that
he
will
be
sentenced
at
the
conclusion
of
his
testimony
in
all
of
the
cases
referred
to
in
this
agreement
and
exhibits
a
and
b
which
accompany
it.
is
it...
do
i
correctly
understand
that
his
sentencing
did
not
take
place
until
all
of
the
testimony
the
state
wanted
had
been
given?
justice
stevens
and
also
i
want
to
be
sure
on
this.
paragraph
18
says,
"the
defendant
is
to
remain
in
the
custody
of
the
pima
county
sheriff
from
the
date
of
the
entry
of
his
plea
until
the
conclusion
of
his
testimony
in
all
of
the
cases
in
which
the
defendant
agrees
to
testify
as
a
result
of
this
agreement.
"
now,
when
was
he
transferred
from
the
custody
of
the
pima
county
sheriff
elsewhere?
justice
stevens
the
day
after
sentencing,
so
it
was
also
before
that
one
bit
of
testimony,
the
last
one
you
mentioned,
had
taken
place?
justice
stevens
you
did
not
contend,
i
take
it,
at
any
time
that
the
transfer
of
custody
violated
the
agreement?
justice
stevens
your
interpretation
was
the
agreement
had
been
fully
performed
at
the
time
of
the
transfer;
that's
your
reading?
justice
stevens
that
that
only
pertained
to
the
one
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
of
course
waives
that.
it
does
say...
one
could
read
this
agreement
to
indicate
that
the
parties
thought
that
at
the
time
he
was
transferred
from
the
sheriff's
custody
to
prison
or
wherever
he
was
transferred
that
he
would
not
get
that
transfer
until
he
had
fully
performed
his
testimonial
obligation?
it
is
certainly
a
permissible
reading,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
what
did
they
say
about
paragraph
18?
justice
stevens
because
it
does
say
he
is
to
remain
in
the
sheriff's
custody
until
the
conclusion
of
his
testimony
in
all
of
the
cases
in
which
the
defendant
agrees
to
testify
as
a
result
of
this
agreement.
justice
stevens
so,
does
not
that
contemplate
his
transfer
will
not
occur
until
he
has
performed
his
testimonial
obligation?
