justice
o'connor
mr.
schafer,
let
me
just
ask
one
procedural
question,
if
i
may.
i
guess
the
respondent
raised
the
double
jeopardy
issue
in
his
first
federal
habeas
proceeding
and
he
lost
at
the
district
court
and
in
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
o'connor
and
certiorari
was
sought
here
and
refused?
justice
o'connor
and
in
the
second
federal
habeas
he
did
not
raise
the
issue?
justice
o'connor
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
sui
sponte
ordered
it
briefed?
justice
o'connor
when
the
second
habeas
was
on
appeal
there?
justice
o'connor
but
your
petition
for
certiorari
raises
no
objections
to
that
rather
curious
procedure?
justice
o'connor
all
right.
justice
o'connor
mr.
englert,
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
possible
for
a
defendant
who
had
entered
into
a
plea
agreement
of
this
type
to
ever
make
a
good
faith
challenge
to
a
provision
in
the
agreement
that
the
defendant
thought
was
unclear
without
thereby
in
effect
waiving
the
double
jeopardy--
justice
o'connor
--but
by
taking
the
route
of
challenging
the
enforceability
of
the
agreement
and
refusing
to
testify
unless
and
until
it
was
clarified
as
it
was
in
this
manner,
would
not
suffice?
