isn't
it
rather
hair-splitting
to
say
that
the
state
court
has
the
ultimate
word
on
what
the
contract
means?
you
agree
that
the
federal
courts
have
to
have
the
ultimate
word
on
whether
indeed
there
was
a
voluntary
waiver
of
the
double
jeopardy
protection,
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
well,
there
could
hardly
be
a
voluntary
waiver
if
the
meaning
of
the
contract
was
unclear,
could
there?
justice
scalia
that's
right,
so
it
comes
down
to
saying
that
the
state
court
decides
what
the
agreement
meant
but
we
decide
whether
the
agreement
clearly
meant
that?
i
mean,
you
know,
if
that
makes
you
feel
better,
i
suppose
you
can
put
it
that
way.
but
don't
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
agreement
clearly
meant
what
the
arizona
court
said
it
meant?
justice
scalia
how
could
it
be...
how
could
we
hold
that
there
was
a
voluntary
waiver
if
we
think
the
agreement
was
unclear?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
position.
is
your
position
that
that
letter
does
not
constitute
a
refusal
to
testify?
justice
scalia
you
mean
if
i
say,
"i
will
only
testify
if
you
pay
me
ten
million
dollars.
"
that's
not
a
refusal
to
testify?
justice
scalia
sort
of
like
assault
or--
justice
scalia
--the
agreement
surely
contemplates
his
agreement
to
testify
without
any
further
preconditions,
so
whether
you're
breaking
the
agreement
simply
depends
upon
whether
you
are
refusing
to
testify
without
preconditions
or
not.
did
the
agreement
envision
that
he
could
comply
with
it
by
saying,
"of
course
i'll
testify;
however
you
have
to
pay
me
ten
million
dollars?
"
that's
not
what
the
agreement
contemplated,
is
it?
justice
scalia
if
he
refused
to
testify
period,
not
if
he
refused
to
testify
including
with
conditions,
right?
justice
scalia
you
use
the
word,
"we
can
anticipate
that",
instead
of,
"i
won't"?
is
the
magic
word
"anticipate"?
anyway,
it
isn't
"anticipate"
here.
it
says,
"it
is
john
adamson's
position
that
if
the
state
of
arizona
desires
adamson's
testimony
the
following
conditions
must
be
met.
"
i
read
that
as
quite
categorical.
"you
meet
these
conditions
or
i
don't
testify.
"
justice
scalia
but
that
is
not
just
what
the
law...
when
you
make
noises
like
a
lawyer
you
have
consequences
like
lawyers,
and
that's
what
the
doctrine
of
anticipatory
breach
is
all
about.
you
can't
go
around
saying
"i'm
not
going
to
do
it.
"
without
consequences.
justice
scalia
well,
that
depends
on
what
voluntary
election
you
want
to
talk
about.
you
are
insisting
that
the
voluntariness
apply
to
the
april
2nd
letter.
why
shouldn't
the
voluntariness
apply
to
the
original
plea
bargaining
agreement?
that
is,
he
voluntarily
agreed
when
he
signed
that
agreement
that
if
he
should
breach
it
he
could
be
retried.
it
later
happened
that
he
did
breach
it.
now,
why
must
one
insist
that
the
condition
of
knowing
and
voluntary
apply
to
the
breach
as
opposed
to
merely
the
signing
of
the
agreement?
that
was
the
deal.
he
voluntarily
agreed
that
if
he
should
breach
the
agreement
he
could
be
retried.
and
he--
justice
scalia
--i
understand.
justice
scalia
why
can't
you?
justice
scalia
just
bringing
waiver,
what's
the
matter
with
it?
justice
scalia
so,
there
was
really
no
way
to
enter
into
this
plea
agreement?
given
what
later
happened,
there
was
no
way
that
the
state
could
have
struck
an
agreement
with
your
client?
