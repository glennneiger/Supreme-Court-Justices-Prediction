mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
here
is
whether
a
person
who
spends
his
full
time
gambling
at
racetracks
for
his
own
account
is
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
for
federal
income
tax
purposes.
this
is
a
question
on
which
the
commissioner,
the
courts,
and
gamblers
have
gone
back
and
forth
over
the
years,
depending
largely,
it
seems,
on
whether
it
was
good
or
bad
taxwise
for
a
gambler
to
be
in
a
trade
or
business
at
the
particular
tax
year
involved
under
the
relevant
tax
provisions.
the
provision
that
gave
rise
to
this
case
was
a
minimum
tax
provision
that
was
in
effect
from
1976
until
1982
under
which
gambling
losses
generally
were
items
of
tax
preference
that
could
give
rise
to
a
minimum
tax
liability.
the
way
a
gambler
could
avoid
minimum
tax
would
be
to
argue
that
his
trade
or
business
was
gambling,
so
that
his
gambling
losses
were
not
garden
variety
itemized
deductions,
but
rather
were
trade
or
business
deductions
that
were
exempt
from
minimum
tax.
the
court
of
appeals
below
accepted
this
argument,
persuaded
in
large
part
by
the
seeming
inequity
of
imposing
a
minimum
tax
on
somebody
who
had
net
gambling
losses
for
the
taxable
year,
as
mr.
groetzinger
did.
congress
has
eliminated
that
inequity
for
years
after
1982
because
it
amended
the
minimum
tax
law
in
that
year
to
remove
gambling
losses
from
the
minimum
tax
base.
now
that
congress
has
fixed
that,
the
irs
cannot
really
tell
whether
it
is
better
for
us
to
win
or
lose
this
case
from
a
revenue
point
of
view
prospectively
because,
as
i
said,
it
can
be
good
or
bad
for
a
gambler
to
be
in
or
not
to
be
in
business.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
is
impossible
to
tell,
justice
brennan,
because
there
are
so
many
different
numbers
on
the
tax
return
that
can
go
up
or
down
depending
on
whether
you
are
in
business.
it
affects
the
adjusted
gross
income
which
is
a
floor
beneath
your
casualty
loss
deduction
and
your
medical
deduction,
the
ceiling
on
your
charitable
contribution
deduction.
it
can
enable
you
to
take
home
office
expenses
deductions.
it
can
also
make
you
liable
for
self-employment
tax
if
you
are
in
a
trade
or
business.
it
is
like
the
fica
tax
employees
pay.
so,
depending
on
whether
the
gambler
has
gains
or
losses
for
the
year
and
whether
he
has
medical
expenses
and
so
forth
it
can
be
good
or
bad
and
you
simply
can't
program
a
computer
to
figure
out
what
the
net
will
be,
so
the
reason
we
sought
certiorari
here
was
to
get
a
clear
answer
to
the
question
to
resolve
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
and
get
an
answer
we
hope
will
be
consistent
with
the
overall
structure
of
the--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--the
new
tax
code
preserves
the
post-'82
treatment
for
gambling
losses.
they
are
still
carved
out
from
minimum
tax
and
so
forth.
i
would
think
the
one
possible
effect
the
decision
could
have...
i
haven't
read
the
new
tax
law
from
cover
to
cover
but
the
new
tax
law
does
put
a
2
percent
floor
underneath
investment
type
expenses.
you
can't
deduct
expenses
of
investing,
of
getting
advice
from
brokers,
investment,
valueline,
that
kind
of
stuff
except
to
the
extent
it
exceeds
2
percent
of
your
adjusted
gross
income,
and
that
basically
puts
a
floor
under
the
section
212
deduction
now
in
the
code,
and
there
may
be
some
greater
incentive
for
investors
to
try
and
say
they
are
in
a
trade
or
business
under
the
new
tax
law
to
avoid
that
2
percent
floor.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
greatest
risk
to
affirmance
would
be
if
the
court
did
anything
to
impugn
the
rule
of
higgins
versus
commissioner,
which
held
that
investors
are
not
in
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
one
might
say
that
very
well.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
unfortunately,
i
did,
yes.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
have
quite
a
bit
of
knowledge
about
the
different
subjects
now.
that
is
true.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
will
because
the
term
is
used
in
50
different
sections
of
the
code.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it
has
a
number
of
special
purpose
definitions
and
special
sections
that
define
it--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--like
the
unrelated
business
income
tax
defines
it
for
purposes
of
one
section.
that
is
true--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--the
majority
of
them
it
is
the
same
definition.
section
162,
section
62.1,
all
of
those
we
generally
think
have
the
same
meaning
of
trade
or
business.
the
court
of
appeals
below
held
that
a
trade
or
business
should
be
defined
as
any
activity
that
can
fairly
be
characterized
as
a
person's
livelihood,
occupation,
or
means
of
earning
a
living,
so
that
the
only
requisites
of
a
trade
or
business
from
that
point
of
view
are
that
you
carry
on
an
activity
on
a
regular
and
extensive
basis
with
the
intent
to
earn
a
profit
or
livelihood
from
it.
we
think
this
definition
has
some
obvious
intuitive
appeal
but
we
think
it
incorrect
under
the
code
as
we
actually
know
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
tax
court
is
one
of
the
courts
that
has
flip-flopped
on
this
question.
when
it
first
came
to
the
tax
court
in
1976,
judge
tannenwald
defined
the
term
much
more
narrowly
and
adopted
what
we
call
the
goods
and
services
test
of
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
in
deputy
v.
dupont
to
hold
that
a
gambler
was
not
in
a
trade
or
business,
and
the
gambler
there
did
not
want
to
be
in
a
trade
or
business
because
he
was
trying
to
be
hit
with
self-employment
tax.
and
then
after
congress
put
in
the
minimum
tax
provision
that
was
bad
for
gamblers,
the
tax
court
reversed
itself,
overruled
judge
tannenwald's
opinion,
so
they
have
not
been
consistent.
they
have
kind
of
sided
with
the
gambler,
depending
on
the
equities
of
the
particular
tax
provision
involved
for
the
relevant
tax
year.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right.
we
are
not
contending
that
there
are
any
equities
on
our
side
in
this
particular
case.
we
are
simply
out
to
get
a
definition
of
trade
or
business
that
does
not
damage
the
entire
structure
of
the
revenue
code.
the
code
itself
regularly
distinguishes
between
trade
or
business
activities
and
other
activities
carried
on
on
a
regular
basis
with
the
intent
to
earn
a
profit.
particularly
in
the
landmark
case
of
higgins,
that
i
mentioned
before,
this
court
held
that
a
full-time
investor
is
not
in
a
trade
or
business
even
though
he
devotes
the
bulk
of
his
time
to
managing
his
securities
portfolio
and
even
though
he
was
engaged
in
a
regular
course
of
activity
with
the
intent
to
earn
a
profit
or
livelihood
from
this
portfolio.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
higgins
had
a
very,
very
large
investment
portfolio
as
well
as
a
very
large
real
estate
activity
apparently,
and
he
did
hire
people
to
work
for
him,
bookkeepers.
he
made
all
the
investment
decisions
himself,
i
think.
he
gave
the--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
did,
and
then
it
enacted
section
212,
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
congress
thought
that
the
problem
with
higgins
was
the
court
had
defined
trade
or
business
too
narrowly
to
exclude
his
kind
of
expenses.
they
respond
to
that
not
by
expanding
the
definition
of
trade
or
business
but
by
enacting
a
new
section,
212,
to
allow
deduction
of
non-business
expenses
incurred
to
produce
income
on
management
investment
property.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
casino
itself
does,
and
a
bookie
would.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
a
casino
is
running
a--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--they
are
offering
roulette,
the
services
of
a
roulette
wheel
or
a
blackjack
dealer
that
gamblers
can
avail
themselves
of
to
gamble.
i
guess
they
are
not
really
offering
goods
but
they
are
offering
services.
they
serve
drinks
while
you
are
at
the
gaming
table,
and
a
bookmaker--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
that
is
providing
a
service
in
that
they
are
making
available
to
gamblers
a
facility
to...
it
is
like
an
amusement
park
type
of
service.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
if
you
think
of
this
being
like
an
amusement
park
and
they
take
their
cut
and
they
provide
fun
for
people--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
enough
to
make
him--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
i
think...
well,
if
he
did
it
on
a
regular,
continuous
basis
and
got
paid,
and
got
money
for
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
he
is
the
one
who
is
providing
the
facilities.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
is
different
from
being
a
gambler.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
we
don't
want
you
to
tell
people
to
hold
gambling
games
in
the
kitchen
as
a
trade
or
business.
no,
we
don't
want
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
i
think
it
is
different
being
the
vendor
or
the
provider
of
the
facility
and
the
consumer
of
the
services
like
the
respondent
here.
he
was
just
a
gambler
who
was
coming
in
to
play,
and
we
think
that
higgins
really
controls
this
case,
because
we
can
see
no
real
distinction
between
somebody
who
engages
in
a
regular
course
of
profit-seeking
investment
activity
and
somebody
who
engages
in
the
regular
course
of
profit-seeking
gambling
activity.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
have
an
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
real
estate
developers,
and
we
think
that
question
is
not
presented
here.
there
is
a
particular
doctrine
that
has
come
up
in
the
tax
shelter
area
called
the
doctrine
of
pre-opening
expenses
that
kind
of
takes
care
of
when
a
real
estate
developer...
a
real
estate
investment
partnership
is
in
the
business
of
renting
apartment
units.
a
developer
himself
would
be
in
a
business
all
the
time
because
he
is
engaged
in
the
regular
course
of
developing,
improving
property.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
think
the--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--there
is
a
line
of
cases
in
the
lower
courts
that
have
held
that
a
stock
trader
as
opposed
to
an
investor
is
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
but
i
think--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think
one
can
find
analogies
both
between
the
investor
and
the
trader
to
the
gambler.
let
me
say
a
little
bit
more
concretely
about
how
they
are
similar.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
position
of
the
irs
is
that
the
full-time
stock
traders
who
do
rapid
turnover
of
investments
are
in
a
trade
or
business,
and
that
goes
back
to--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
agree,
it
is
very
close
to
this
case,
and
i
think
that
is
what
makes
this
case
difficult.
if
we
didn't
have
that
line
of
cases,
i
think
this
case
would
be
easy
after
higgins.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
would,
because
then
you
have
to
ask
why
did
higgins
come
out
the
way
it
did.
if
you
are
right,
why
wasn't
mr.
higgins,
who
spent
all
of
his
time
running
around
managing
his
investments
and
giving
buy
and
sell
instruction,
picking
stocks.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
was
only
overruled
insofar
as
the
result,
but
congress
did
not
overrule
the
holding
that
he
was
not
in
a
trade
or
business.
the
congress
preserved
that
holding
and
enacted
a
new
provision
to
allow
non-business
deductions
to
be
taken.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
element
we
would
say
is
missing
is,
he
does
not
hold
himself
out
as
offering
to
sell
goods
or
services
to
others,
and
i
think
that
a
gambler
does
not
do
that,
and
there
are
other...
there
are
some
illegal
activities,
for
example,
embezzlers.
you
may
have
an
embezzler
who
spends
his
days
casing
houses
and
looking
for...
trying
to
find
new
ways
to
get
money
from
his
employer
and
tries
to
make
a
living
doing
that,
but
the
courts
have
held
he
is
not
in
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
an
embezzler
who
just
takes
money
out
of
his--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think
a
con
man
or
a
drug
dealer
is
in
a
trade
or
business
because
they
are
selling
something.
it
may
be
illegal,
but
if
they
file
the
tax
return
they
could
claim
cost
of
goods
sold.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
i
think
the
advantage
of
justice
frankfurter's
test
is,
it
explains
why
people
like
embezzlers
and
investors
and
gamblers
are
not
in
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
is
what
the
courts
have
held,
that
he--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--we
agree.
we
feel
we
are
stuck
with
that
line
of
cases
and
don't
wish
to
abandon
it.
and
frankly,
if
the
court
decides
that
it
is
impossible
to
rule
in
our
favor
here
without
disapproving
the
stock
trader
cases,
my
orders
are
to
say
that
you
should
affirm
the
decision
below
because
the
service
believes
that
the
stock
trader
cases
have
become
so
firmly
entrenched
in
the
law,
going
back
to
1918
rulings
of
the
irs,
that
they
can't
be...
they
came
before
higgins
in
a
way
and
they
can't
be
abandoned,
but
we
think
that
the
two
lines
can
be
reconciled.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
would
say
he
is
not.
he
is
a
coin
collector
who
is
trading--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--the
rationale
of
the
stock
trader
cases
is
that
the
trader
is
trying
to
take
advantage
of
the
kind
of
short-term
swings
in
the
market,
like
to
get...
much
as
an
arbitraguer
would,
to
get
a
little
eighth
here,
an
eighth
there,
because
of
market
swings,
and
that
requires
extremely
heavy
trading.
i
don't
think
a
coin
investor--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
the
service
would
agree
that
a
person
who
dealt
in
gold
bullion
in
a
fashion
similar
to
a
stock
trader
who
is
held
to
be
in
a
business
would
also--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
would
have
to
be
a
very
short
swing
situation,
i
think,
and
very,
very
frequent
trades.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
section
212
allows
someone
to
deduct
expenses
incurred
in
managing
his
investments,
but
it
would
not
allow
him
to
deduct,
say,
home
office
expenses,
and
that
is
why
full-time
investors
continue
to
try
and
seek
trade
or
business
status
to
be
able
to
take
other
deductions
outside
of
212
under
section
162,
and
the
like.
but
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
consider
in
a
kind
of
concrete
way
what
a
full-time
investor
does,
resembles
what
a
full-time
gambler
does.
a
full-time
investor
presumably
spends
much
of
his
time
reading
the
wall
street
journal
and
becoming
knowledgeable
about
where
to
put
his
money.
he
reads
value
line,
follows
the
dow-jones
ticker,
reads
corporate
10k
statements,
consults
with
brokers
and
people
in
the
industry
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
best
companies
or
commodities
are,
and
once
he
has
gotten
educated
he
places
a
bet
essentially
on
a
particular
corporation
or
commodity
by
buying
a
securities
contract,
and
he
thereby
expresses
his
hope
that
that
company
will
do
better
than
all
the
other
companies
on
the
stock
exchange.
if
he
is
right,
he
will
get
a
payoff
many
times
his
investment.
if
he
is
wrong,
he
may
become
worthless.
now,
a
gambler
who
gambles
full-time
is
very
similar.
he
presumably
spends
his
days
becoming
knowledgeable
about
where
to
put
his
money.
he
reads
the
newspapers,
racing
programs,
racing
forms.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
he
probably
reads
the
racing
columns
in
all
the
newspapers.
that
may
take
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
morning.
and
then
he
goes
down
to
the
track
and
he
talks
to
jockeys
and
other
bettors
and
tries
to
get
a
sense
of
what
the
best
horses
or
dogs
are,
and
he
then
places
his
bet
on
the
horse
or
dog
he
thinks
is
going
to
do
best
by
buying
a
betting
slip,
and
both
the
full-time
gambler
and
the
full-time
investor
are
taking
some
risks,
but
basically
they
hope
they
can
beat
the
market
because
of
the
superior
information
and
sophistication
they
have
by
doing
what
they
do
full-time.
we
think
that
neither
of
them,
despite
the
fact
he
uses
some
skill
in
what
he
is
doing,
is
in
a
trade
or
business,
and
the
reason
is,
the
reason
justice
frankfurter
gave
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
deputy
v.
dupont,
a
case
a
year
before
higgins
which
likewise
involved
an
investor,
and
he
said
that
an
investor
is
not
in
a
trade
or
business
because
he
does
not
hold
himself
out
to
others
as
engaged
in
the
selling
of
goods
or
services.
the
same
we
think
is
true
of
a
gambler
who
does
not
act
as
a
bookie
or
casino
operator
or
sell
tips
to
other
people,
but
rather
gambles
solely
for
his
own
account.
we
think
the
goods
or
services
test
is
a
useful
tool
for
differentiating
the
world
of
trade
or
business
activities
from
a
somewhat
larger
universe
of
activities
undertaken
with
the
intent
to
make
a
profit.
it
explains
why
investors
are
not
in
a
trade
or
business
no
matter
how
extensive
and
busy
they
are
about
their
investments.
it
explains
why
gamblers
of
all
types,
whether
they
play
roulette,
poker,
bingo,
keno,
or
horse
races,
are
not
in
a
trade
or
business.
it
explains
why
housewives
or
house-husbands
who
sit
home
and
cut
the
tops
of
cereal
boxes
and
enter
contests
all
day
are
not
in
a
trade
or
business.
and
it
explains
why
people
like
embezzlers
and
burglars
are
not
in
a
trade
or
business.
each
of
these
people
may
spend
a
lot
of
time
all
day
trying
to--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think...
well,
a
con
man,
he
has
to
be
offering
goods
or
services,
and
if
he
is
selling
deficient
products
i
would
say
he
is
in
a
trade
or
business.
if
he
is
simply
trying
to--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--there
always
will
be
strange
cases,
that's
true,
that
are
hard
to
categorize
one
way
or
the
other.
we
think
the
frankfurter
formula
is
also
useful
as
an
administrative
device
because
it
allows
whole
categories
of
taxpayers
to
be
classified
and
thereby
avoiding
the
ad
hoc
and
arbitrary
line
drawing
approach
that
the
respondents'
approach
would
require.
for
example,
under
the
approach
that
respondent
would
urge
the
court
would
have
to
figure
out
how
much
time
one
needs
to
spend
on
gambling
to
make
it
a
trade
or
business,
and
there
probably
are
millions
of
people
in
the
country
who
gamble,
many
of
whom,
one
suspects,
are
not
in
a
trade
or
business,
and
the
courts
would
have
to
draw
really
arbitrary
lines
between
casual
and
truly
dedicated
gamblers.
the
courts
might
also
have
to
draw
arbitrary
lines
between
different
types
of
gambling
activities.
the
respondent
probably
himself
would
agree
that
a
retired
person
who
lives
in
las
vegas
and
plays
slot
machines
eight
hours
a
day
is
not
in
a
trade
or
business.
i
think
that
would
have
to
be...
that
would
be
correct.
and
respondent
might
try
and
distinguish
between
gambling
like
bingo
and
slot
machines
and
roulette
from
activities
like
poker,
horseracing,
and
dog
racing
on
the
theory
the
latter
involved
more
skill
and
are
not
purely,
purely
games
of
chance,
and
that
also,
i
think,
could
require
difficult
line
drawing
problems
depending
on
how
much
time
the
gambler
spent
on
each
type
of
gambling.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
where
would
i
put?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
i
know
much
about
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
like
bingo.
well,
our
position
is,
all
gambling,
all
gamblers
don't
qualify,
and
i
think
that
clearly
is
on
the
end
of
pure
chance.
there
is
not
much
skill
involved,
i
guess,
in
buying
lottery
tickets.
it
is
like,
you
know,
again
like
the
houseperson
who
just
enters
contests
and
sends
off
jingles
to
cereal
companies.
and
the
problem
is,
because
it
can
be
good
or
bad
to
be
in
a
trade
or
business,
depending
on
the
gambler's
particular
facts,
whether
he
won
or
lost
money
for
the
year,
what
he
is
trying
to
deduct.
gamblers
can
pull
all
these
factual
levers
and
pulleys
involving
how
much
time
they
spend
and
what
kind
of
gambling
they
are
doing
trying
to
get
the
best
result
for
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
again,
it
would
depend
on
the
amount
of
time
and
seriousness
spent.
if
a
person
seriously
was
writing
advertising
copy
for
corporations
i
think
that
would
be
a
trade
or
business,
because
you
are
offering
services.
someone
who
just
sends
off
jingles
that
get
put
in
a
bin
and
they
spin
around
and
pick
one
out
would
not
be.
that
would
simply
be
entering
a
contest.
that
would
not
be--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
maybe
if
you
then
became
established
as
a
good
copywriter
you
could
wind
up
later
on
being--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--probably
in
either
event
just
doing
it
once
wouldn't
be
enough
besides
selling
goods
you
have
to
also
do
it
on
a
regular
basis.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
the
difference
is
that
the
jingles
have
an
element
of
entering
a
contest
in
them,
and
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
might
also
be
hard
to
show
a
profit
motive
if
you
are
writing
jingles
like
thousands
of
people.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it
only
involves
$2,000
a
year.
that
is
absolutely
right.
and
we
had
no
desire
to
subject
mr.
groetzinger
to--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
reason
we
had
to
seek
certiorari
was
because
there
was
a
circuit
conflict
on
the
question
and
the
commissioner
couldn't
simply
change
his
position
because
either
way
he
went
it
would
be
good
or
bad
for
some
gamblers.
we
had
to
have
a
clear
answer
from
this
court,
and
we
tried
to
keep
it
out
of
the
court
for
a
long
time,
and
finally
we
couldn't
avoid
it
any
longer
and
here
we
are,
and
we
need
to
have
an
answer.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
congress
did
help
gamblers
out
in
that
it
took
care
of
the
minimum
tax
problem
that
created
this
litigation,
but
i
think
congress
has
simply
decided
to
leave
to
the
courts
defining
this
term,
because
it
has
been
a
judicial
term
for
a
great
many
years,
and--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--not
generally.
there
have
been
proposals
to
find
but
particular
purposes.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
except
for
the
first
gambler
case
to
come
to
the
tax
court
when
he
argued
that
the
gambler
was
in
business
so
he
could
be
hit
with
self-employment
tax,
that,
i
think,
is
the
only
departure
that
i
am
aware
of
from
the
consistent
position
that
the
frankfurter
formula
is
correctly
part
of
the
test
for
trade
or
business.
and
we
took
that
position
in
the
show
case
which
involved
the
research,
r8d
expenses
in
this
court,
and
the
department
of
justice
determined
not
to
appeal
that
first
tax
court
case
where
the
commissioner
lost,
and
the
commissioner
agreed
with
the
no
appeal
decision.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
there
are
no
regulations
that
define
trade
or
business
for
all
purposes.
it
may
be
that
the
reason
that...
the
term
does
appear
in
so
many
different
parts
of
the
code
that
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
reluctance
to
have
a
regulation
define
it
for
all
purposes
for
fear
of
having
something
being
whipsawed
in
some
context,
but
it
is
a
term
the
courts
have
tried
to
define,
and
i
think
that
both
the
commissioner
and
congress
have
left
it
to
the
courts
to
do
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
then
we
can
go
to
congress.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
yes,
then
we
get
two
bites
of
the
apple
that
way.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
might
make
one
point
in
response
to
your
questions,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
possible,
the
courts
have
held,
for
a
person
to
be
in
more
than
one
trade
or
business
at
a
time,
and
what
often
has
happened
is,
people
have
tried
to
use
a
hobby
loss
like
raising
horses
or
operating
a
winery
on
the
side
as
in
effect
a
tax
shelter
to
shelter
their
professional
salary
income
by
using
the
losses
from
the
second
supposed
business
to
deduct
against
income
from
the
first.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
depreciation--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
still
would
not
explain
higgins
though.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
he
was
doing
it
very
regularly.
