unknown
speaker
does
this
definition,
what
amounts
to
a
trade
or
business,
it
will
have
some
general
applicability,
won't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
think
that...
i
guess
you
don't
need
to
know,
but
is
it
supposed
to
mean
the
same
thing
in
all
these
sections?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
for
some
other
sections
the
way
this
is
defined
it
will
be--
unknown
speaker
--has
that
been
the
consistent
position
of
the
tax
court
over
the
years?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they
have
been
on
the
side
of
equity?
unknown
speaker
he
was
trying
to
deduct
the
salaries
of
his
employees,
wasn't
he,
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
didn't
congress
later
decide
that
he
should
have
been
able
to
deduct
these
expenses?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lauber,
does
a
casino
offer
goods
or
services
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
as
you
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
are
the
services?
unknown
speaker
say
a
casino
where
you
have,
say,
just
a
dice
table.
unknown
speaker
at
the
slot
machines,
too?
unknown
speaker
at
the
slot
machines,
too?
unknown
speaker
it
is
certainly
not
gambling
because
gambling
is
a
game
of
chance,
and
the
casinos
don't
take
chances.

unknown
speaker
what
if
this
man
provided
his
own
dice
and
he
went
to
a
dice
game
every
day
and
he
brought
the
dice,
played
with
a
bunch
of
friends
and
they
gambled
every
day
full-time
but
he
is
the
one
who
supplied
the
dice?
would
that
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
the
same
as
a
casino
supplying
the
dice?
and
it
is
always
at
his
house.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
gets
money
when
he
wins,
of
course;
he
doesn't
when
he
loses,
just
like--
unknown
speaker
--and
they
use
his
kitchen.
unknown
speaker
if
he
used
his
kitchen,
he
had
a
permanent
poker
game
or
dice
game,
then
he
is
like
a
casino.
is
that
right?
you
don't
really
want
us
to
hold
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
so.
unknown
speaker
what
about
real
estate
development?
that
is
like
a
person
with
an
investment
portfolio?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lauber,
the
case
of
the
full-time
stock
trader
seems
to
me
rather
analogous
to
the
full-time
gambler--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
stock
trader
is
treated
as
having
deductible.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
incorrect,
that
that
shouldn't
be
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
treat,
how
would
you
treat
the
full-time
stock
trader
under
the
rule
you
seek?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
is
really
close
to
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right,
if
you
were
to
develop
a
rule
that
said
if
it
is
a
profit-seeking
activity,
if
it
is
activity
that
is
intensively
engaged
in
over
a
period
of
time
with
personal
effort
of
the
taxpayer,
and
you
are
not
structuring
in
the
preliminary
costs
of
getting
into
business,
i
mean,
would
that
take
care
of
your
concerns
with
the
investor?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
hard
to
pay
that
much
reliance
on
higgins,
which
was
effectively
overruled
by
statute
shortly
thereafter.
unknown
speaker
what
element
is
missing
out
of
the
list
i
gave
you?
unknown
speaker
what
about
an
embezzler
that
sells
shoddy
goods
and
services,
misrepresents
them
and
gives
you
not
what
he
said
he
would?
unknown
speaker
never
mind
embezzler.
i
mean,
it
is
not
embezzlement,
but
a
con
man
who--
unknown
speaker
--right,
so
that
sort
of
takes
some
of
the
force
out
of
the
fact
that
an
embezzler
would
be
included
because
under
any
definition
you
are
going
to
get
some
strange
people
included.
it
seems
to
me
no
more
desirable
to
include
con
men
than
it
does
embezzlers.
so
no
matter
what
definition
you
get
you
are
going
to
get
some
strange
people
included
as
conducting
a
trade
or
business.
unknown
speaker
but
the
only
difference
between
higgins
and
the
stock
trader
is
that
higgins
didn't
move
his
stuff
as
fast
as
a
stock
trader
would?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
the
government
agrees,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lauber,
let
me
ask
you
another
case.
supposing
a
person
were
engaged
for
his
own
account
in
buying
and
selling
old
coins
or
other
old
artifacts
of
some
kind
but
he
never
offered
them
to
the
public,
he
always
just
kind
of
gambled
on
the
market
and
would
buy
from
dealers
and
sell
to
dealers.
would
he
be
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business?
unknown
speaker
the
same
sort
of
thing
a
stock
trader
would
be.
that
is
even
closer
to
a
stock
trader,
it
seems
to
me,
because
he
is
buying
and
selling
something
for
which
there
is
a
market,
but
he
is
always
doing
it
just
on
his
own
account.
unknown
speaker
how
about
gold
bullion,
large
quantities
of
gold
bullion
always
trading
on
your
own
account?
and
you
know,
there
are
changes
in
the
market
every
day
on
that.
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
to
be
a
short
swing
situation.
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
that
the
congressional
overturning
of
higgins
only
overturns
it
as
to
whether
a
deduction
can
be
taken.
unknown
speaker
and
that
there
are
other
elements
in
the
tax
code
which
continue
to
apply
the
higgins
rule
to
someone
who
is
managing
his
own
investments,
detrimentally
or,
for
that
matter,
favorably
to
that
individual
as
not
considering
that
a
trade
or
business
for
purposes
of
other
provisions
of
the
code.
unknown
speaker
he
only
reads
the
morning
telegraph.
unknown
speaker
xxx
he
only
reads
the
morning
telegraph?
unknown
speaker
xxx
maybe
he
reads.
unknown
speaker
but
not
why
con
men
are
not
in
a
trade.
unknown
speaker
that
really
does
not
make
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds,
even
this
test,
right?
there
are
still
some
strange
things
that
are
going
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--where
would
you
put
numbers?
unknown
speaker
numbers?
oh,
you
don't
know
anything
about
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
gambling.
lottery.
yes,
where
would
you
put
that,
where
somebody
buys
a
lottery
ticket
for
ten
cents
every
day?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
sending
in
a
bunch
of
jingles
in
a
contest
and
sending
a
bunch
of
short
stories
to
a
magazine
editor?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
don't
they
sometimes
publish
the
winners
of
those
and
use
the
jingle
in
their
advertising?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
just
wrote
one
story
and
it
is
published.
what
about
one
jingle
that
is
published
on
some
nationally
advertised
product
and
millions
of
people
see
it
on
television?
unknown
speaker
an
author
who
writes
100
stories
and
only
one
gets
published
isn't
engaged
in
a
business,
and
a
guy
who
writes
100
jingles
and
one
gets...
i
don't
understand
the
difference.
unknown
speaker
they
provide
a
service.
i
think...
maybe
i
am
wrong,
but
it
is
my
understanding
they
use
these
things
in
their
advertising
if
they
hit
one
that
is
particularly,
you
know,
attractive
to
the
audience.
i
don't
know
why
that
is
any
different
than
writing
a
short
story.
unknown
speaker
if
you
did
it
full-time.
we
are
assuming
this
is
full-time
activity,
and
it
is
the
only
way
he
gets
any
money,
like
this
man.
this
one
only
involved
$2,000
a
year.

xxx.
unknown
speaker
but
the
higgins
case
was
decided
in
about
1940
or
'41,
and
in
all
this
time
nobody
has
ever
asked
congress
to
help
you
but
in
this
problem.
is
that
right?
i
suppose
they
can
decide
some
of
these
issues.
unknown
speaker
xxx
any
legislation
defining
it?
unknown
speaker
but
has
the
commissioner
consistently
taken
the
position
that
trade
or
business
means
what
you
now
urge
it
means?
unknown
speaker
but
he
never
wrote
any
regulations
on
the
point,
either.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
mind
us
giving
a
general
definition
like
that
that
will
whipsaw
everything?
it
is
tough
for
the
tax
commissioner
because
he
doesn't
know
what
he
is
doing,
but
we
do,
so
we
can
just
come
up
with
it.

and
if
you

street

away.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
that
may
well
be,
but
it
doesn't
matter.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
government
is
saying
is,
it
is
all
right
to
gamble,
and
you
can
still
qualify
as
being
a
trade
or
business,
but
you
have
to
gamble
on
the
purchase
and
sale
of
goods
and
services.
so
long
as
that
is
what
you
are
gambling
on,
you
are
still
in
the
realm
of
goods
and
services.
you
can
gamble
on
the
buying
and
selling
of
goods
and
services.
that
is
what
the
trader
does.
he
gambles
that
if
he
sells
it
a
couple
of
years
from
now
it
is
going
to
be...
he
is
going
to
get
more
money
than
if
he
sells
it
today.
it
isn't
the
fact
of
gambling
that
makes
the
difference.
it
is
what
you
are
gambling
on.
the
government
says,
so
long
as
you
are
gambling
on
the
purchase
and
sale
of
something
you
are
still
in
a
trade
or
business,
whereas
the
person
who
places
a
bet
on
a
dog
race
is
not
gambling
on
the
purchase
and
sale
of
goods.
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
and
he
is
pitting
his
wits,
or
if
you
like
his
luck
perhaps
against
theirs,
out
what
determines
who
wins
or
who
loses
is
ultimately
the
purchase
and
sale
of
goods.
unknown
speaker
that
may
well
be.
i
mean,
ultimately
when
he
buys
a
stock
he
is
buying
a
share
in
a
company,
but
even
if
you
don't,
look
on
it
that
way,
and
you
simply
say
he
is
buying
a
piece
of
paper,
which
some
people
will
pay
more
for
today
than
they
may
pay
for
tomorrow.
he
is
still
buying
or
selling
something.
what
is
the
bettor
in
a
dog
race
buying
or
selling?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
that.
you
can
say
that,
but
is
it
true?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
courts
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
the
commissioner
has.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
the
definition
of
trade
or
business
that
the
tax
court
regularly
uses
in
other
contexts?
unknown
speaker
what
about...
how
about
the
investor?
unknown
speaker
what
do
they
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
higgins.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
he
has
to
get
income,
doesn't
he,
before
he
can
deduct
any
of
it,
so
an
inventor
who
never
sells
a
thing
isn't
going
to
have
any
income
tax
problems.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
in
this
case,
mr.
baymiller,
the
tax
is
imposed
on
a
gross
loss,
not
income
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baymiller,
how
can
you...
can
we
agree
with
you
and
stand
by
higgins?
let's
talk
about
the
investor
as
opposed
to
the
trader,
a
person
who
has
extensive
investments
and
really
spends
his
whole
day
managing
those
investments
full-time.
he
does
nothing
but
look
over
this
investment
and
see
if
this
company
is
indeed
still
worth
investing
in,
what
are
its
prospects
over
the
next
five
years,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
full-time
occupation.
why
isn't
that
as
much
a
trade
or
business
as
gambling
if
we
agree
with
you
that
you
don't
have
to
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
buying
or
selling
goods
or
services?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
with
you.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
agree
with
you
we
have
to
disagree
with
higgins.
unknown
speaker
if
you
call
that
a
rule.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
a
rule.
it
is
a
throwing
up
of
the
hands,
isn't
it,
essentially?
unknown
speaker
the
problem
with
that
is
that
there
are
600
district
judges
in
the
country
and
they
may
not
know
when
we
know
when
he
is
in
business.

[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
how
long
have
gambling
losses
been
deduction,
or
are
they,
for
the
purposes
of
the
federal
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
historically,
for
a
long
time
they
weren't
deductible
at
all,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
always?
unknown
speaker
but
just
not
against...
just
not
against
other
income?
unknown
speaker
but
if
a
gambler
loses
every
bet
he
ever
places
he
is
not
going
to
have
a
minimum
tax.
unknown
speaker
you
have
got
to--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
well,
so
will
the
inventor
who
never
sells
an
invention.
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
do...
i
don't
see
how
it
does
him
any
good
to
be
in
business
if
he
never
gets
any
income.
unknown
speaker
but
what
does
he
deduct
it
from?
unknown
speaker
so
he
claimed
he
was
in
business
for
writing
a
book
at
the
same
time
he
was
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
oh,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
which
court
was
this?
unknown
speaker
which
court
was
this,
one
of
the
600
judges?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
all
right.
was
it
a
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
how
they
could
have
done
that
if
they
simply
took
account
of
the
simple
rule
to
take
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
into
account.

you
have
mentioned
it
ten
times.
why
waste
my
listening
to
hear
that
over
and
over
again?
unknown
speaker
that
if
he
were
here
he
would
do
this?
mr.
baymiller,
this
certainly
has
no
bearing
on
the
case,
but
out
of
curiosity
is
mr.
groetzinger
still
in
full-time
gambling?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lauber,
it
is
clear
from
the
code
that
something
can
be
a
profit-making
activity
but
not
be
a
trade
or
business.
unknown
speaker
it
is
very
clear
that
you
have
to
draw
some
distinction
between
those
two.
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
necessary
to
draw
a...
wouldn't
it
be
enough
to
support
that
distinction
simply
to
say
that
it
has
to
be
a
profit-making
activity
that
you
engage
in
regularly
as
opposed
to
an
isolated
piece
of
profit?
would
that
suffice
to
make
the
code
distinctions
make
sense?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
wouldn't
explain...
well,
that's
true.
