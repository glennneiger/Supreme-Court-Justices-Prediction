mr.
lauber,
will
the
decision
we
make
have
any
consequences
under
the
new
tax
code
to
take
effect
next
year
or
are
the
definitions
changed
enough
for
that
that
it
doesn't
have
an
impact?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
virtue
of
section
212
are
there
any
consequences
if
this
case
were
affirmed
outside
the
context
of
full-time
gambling?
what
are
the
real
risks
of
an
affirmance
in
other
areas
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
could
be
affirmed,
i
suppose,
without
doing
that,
depending
upon
what
the
elements
were
of
the
test
to
be
employed.
