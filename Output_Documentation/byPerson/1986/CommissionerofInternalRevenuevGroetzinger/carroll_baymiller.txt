mr.
carroll
baymiller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
a
little
surprised
at
the
government
when
they
likened
the
professional
gambler
to
the
investor.
anybody
that
says
placing
bets
at
the
racetrack
is
an
investment
has
another
think
coming
because
he
doesn't
have
a
chance
unless
he
knows
what
he
is
doing,
unless
he
studies,
unless
he
works
60
to
80
hours
a
week
as
bob
groetzinger
does.
otherwise
he
has
no
chance.
it
is
not
an
investment.
now,
the
difference
between
an
investor
and
the
active
trader
according
to
the
courts
is
that
the
investor
is
letting
his
money
earn
a
living
for
him.
he
isn't
doing
the
earning.
his
investment
is
doing
the
earning.
he
buys
stocks
and
bonds
and
he
puts
them
in
his
vault
and
every
so
often
he
gets
a
check
for
a
dividend
or
for
interest,
so
he
is
not
working.
the
active
trader
is
working
practically
every
day
of
his
life.
now,
a
trader
who
goes
to
the
brokerage
office
maybe
once
a
week
or
two
or
three
times
a
month
and
buys
and
sells
a
few
stocks
or
commodities
certainly
is
not
in
business
because
it
isn't
a
frequent
activity.
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
all
of
the
courts
have
said,
that
the
activity
must
be
frequent
and
regular.
the
government
says
that
the
active
trader
is
engaged
in
holding
himself
out
to
others
as
selling
goods
or
services,
and
they
justify
it
by
saying
that
he
is
buying
and
selling
stocks
and
commodities.
now,
that
is
a
joke.
we
all
know
that
the
active
trader
is
gambling.
he
is
betting
that
the
price
of
a
stock
will
go
up
or
go
down.
when
he
buys
stock
he
doesn't
take
delivery--
mr.
carroll
baymiller
--but,
your
honor,
he
is
betting
with
every
other
patron
at
the
track,
the
same
as
the
active
trader
is
buying
and
selling
with
every
other
active
trader
all
over
the
country.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
i
say
the
active
trader
is
not
buying
and
selling
goods
at
all.
the
active
trader
today
is
betting
on
the
rise
or
fall
of
the
dow-jones
averages.
that
is
what
the
active
trader
does
today.
he
buys
futures.
he
is
not
buying
goods
at
all.
he
goes
in
and
he
says,
i
will
bet
that
the
dow-jones
average
will
go
up
too
points
today.
if
it
goes
up
he
wins.
if
it
goes
down
he
loses.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
he
is
buying
part
of
a
dog
to
win.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
he
is
making
a
bet.
they
say
that
the
casino
operator
is
in
business
because
he
is
offering
bets
to
the
customer.
it
takes
two
to
gamble,
and
the
man
that
goes
into
the
bookmaker's
office
is
offering
to
make
a
bet
with
the
bookmaker.
now,
it
is
different
with
the
track.
the
government
says
in
the
reply
brief
that
the
gambler
is
making
a
contract
with
the
track.
now,
that
just
is
not
true.
the
track
is
not
making
bets.
the
track
is
a
bookie,
is
a
broker
the
same
as
a
stockbroker.
the
track
is
merely
handling
the
bets
of
everybody
that
goes
to
the
window
and
determining
how
what
is
left
is
to
be
divided,
because
the
track
and
the
state
take
about
20
percent
first.
the
frankfurter
test
has
been
used
to
deny
business
status
only
in
the
gambling
cases.
they
did
not
use
that
test
to
deny
business
status
in
higgins.
justice
frankfurter
was
on
the
higgins
court.
justice
reed
concurred
with
justice
frankfurter
in
the
dupont
case
and
wrote
the
decision
in
higgins
and
never
mentioned
the
frankfurter
test.
that
test
has
never
been
mentioned
by
this
court
since.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
the
courts
of
appeals,
three
circuits,
three
circuits
have
used
the
frankfurter
test
which--
mr.
carroll
baymiller
--the
commissioner
has.
counsel
says
that
the
tax
court
has
flip-flopped.
that
is
not
true.
in
one
case,
gentile,
they
decided
that
the
full-time
gambler
was
not
in
business,
and
every
case
since
that
time,
even
in
view
of
being
reversed
by
the
second
and
sixth
circuits,
they
adhered
to
the
proposition
that
the
full-time
gambler
is
in
business
and
that
the
frankfurter
test
should
not
be
used
and
should
not
be
adopted
by
the
courts
in
determining
whether
a
full-time
gambler
is
in
business.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
i
don't
know
that
they
have.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
the
investor--
mr.
carroll
baymiller
--they
don't
say
that
the
investor...
well,
they
follow
this
court's
decision
about
the
investor.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
higgins.
but
they
do
not
say
that
higgins
was
not
in
business
because
he
did
not
offer
to
sell
goods
or
services.
they
did
not
use
that
as
the
test.
they
said
he
wasn't
in
business
because
he
was
making
investments,
which
is
the
same
as
all
of
us
do,
at
least
to
some
extent.
we
all
are
investors,
even
if
we
do
nothing
more
than
put
a
$5
bill
in
a
savings
account
every
week.
that
is
what
this
court
held,
but
they
didn't
do
so
because
in
higgins
the
man
did
not
offer
to
sell
goods
and
services.
now,
there
are
many,
many
other
situations
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
courts
have
held
a
person
to
be
in
business
where
he
didn't
offer
to
sell
anything.
take
for
instance
the
tennis
pro
and
the
golf
pro.
the
government
says
that
he
is
offering...
he
is
selling
entertainment.
that
may
be
true
for
the
mcenroes
and
the
lendis
and
the
nicklauses
and
those
people,
but
i
am
talking
about
what
may
be
termed
the
cannon
fodder
that
go
to
these
tournaments
week
after
week,
pay
their
own
expenses,
pay
an
entry
fee
to
get
in.
they
aren't
paid
anything
to
come
there.
pay
an
entry
fee
to
get
in.
and
if
they
win
a
match
they
win
some
money.
now,
what
have
they
sold
or
what
are
they
offering
to
sell?
there
can't
be
any
question
but
what
they
are
in
business.
we
have
cases,
there
are
cases
in
the
circuit
courts,
some
of
them
even
in
the
second
and
sixth.
here
is
a
man
who
decides
to
be
an
inventor,
and
he
works
on
it
day
in
and
day
out,
never
gets
anything
invented,
never
sells
a
thing,
but
the
court
said
that
he
was
in
business.
here
is
a
lawyer
who
spent--
mr.
carroll
baymiller
--he
could
still
be
subject
to
minimum
tax.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
that
is
absolutely
true.
absolutely
true.
here
is
a
case
that
the
tax
court
recently
decided.
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
on
appeal
or
not,
it
hasn't
reached
the
appellate
division
yet,
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
meridith,
he
bet
$294,000
in
one
year
and
lost
$310,000
that
is
a
$16,000
loss
for
the
year.
and
the
government
assessed
him
a
minimum
tax
of
over
$16,000.
so
that
he
had
an
economic
loss
for
the
year
of
$32,000
and
paid
a
tremendous
amount
of
tax
to
the
state
of
colorado
and
commissions
to
the
track
so
that
we
say
that
the
active
gambler,
the
professional
gambler
does
not
get
for
himself
equal
protection
of
the
law.
the
law
says
that
the
casino
operator
can...
is
in
business.
why
isn't
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
in
business?
now,
a
district
judge
out
in
reno--
mr.
carroll
baymiller
--i
think
it
is.
i
personally
think
that
the
full-time
investor
is
in
business,
and
congress
apparently
has
thought
so,
too,
because--
mr.
carroll
baymiller
--higgins...
but
higgins
did
lay
down
the
rule
that
you
examine
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
a
person's
activity
to
decide
whether
he
is
in
business.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
well,
it
is
the
best
we
have.
it
is
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
that
probably
is
true.
that
probably
is
true
but
it
is
like
courts
have
said
many
times.
we
can't
define
obscenity
or
pornography
but
we
know
it
when
we
see
it.
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
the
courts
should
say.
we
know
when
a
man
is
in
business
and
when
he
isn't
in
business.
now,
the
full-time
gambler
is
in
business--
mr.
carroll
baymiller
--i
agree
with
that,
but
you
just
can't...
i
don't
think
you
can
have
a
very
specific
limiting
definition
of
when
a
person
is
in
business.
justice
frankfurter,
if
he
were
here
today,
i
am
sure
that
he
wouldn't
say
that
a
full-time
gambler
is
not
in
business.
at
the
time
he
laid
down
this
rule
we
knew
nothing
about
partmutuel
gambling.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
they
are
deductible
only
to
the
extent
of
winnings,
specifically.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
i
think
they
have
been.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
i
think
so.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
that's
right.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
that
is
true.
that
is
true,
because...
well,
he--
mr.
carroll
baymiller
--he
will
soon
be
out
of
business.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
and
about...
we
had
the
author.
here
is
the
author,
who
spends
hours
and
hours
gathering
material
and
writing
a
book.
never
gets
it
published,
never
sells
a
thing,
never
offers
to
sell
a
thing,
but
the
courts
have
held
he
is
in
business.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
he
deducted...
he
is
not
the
same
as
gambler
where
his
deductions
are
limited
to
his
winnings.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
well,
in
the
particular
case
that
i
refer
to
the
man
was
a
lawyer.
and
he
spent
30
hours
a
week
working
on
a
book,
taking
pictures
and
gathering
materials
to
publish
a
book.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
yes,
and
the
court
held
he
was.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
the
court
absolutely
held
he
was,
even
though...
and
what
did
they
say?
how
did
they
justify
it?
they
said--
mr.
carroll
baymiller
--pardon
me?
mr.
carroll
baymiller
i
think
i
can
find
it,
your
honor.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
yes,
it
was
a
court
of
appeals.
i
think
it
was
either
the
second
sixth,
which
didn't
follow
that
same
reasoning
when
they
got
to
the
gambling
cases.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
they
said
that
he
worked
at
it,
that
he
hoped
to
make
a
profit
some
day,
but
not
during
the
tax
year
in
question,
but
they
said
he
worked
30
hours
a
week
gathering
materials
for
a
book
that
he
hoped
to
write.
and
the
court
said,
well,
he
is
in
business.
he
went
to
see
some
publishers
to
try
to
get
it
published
but
he
never
offered,
he
never
had
anything
to
offer
for
sale.
that
is
the
reason
i
say
that
justice
frankfurter's
test
does
just
not
stand
up,
and
if
he
were
here
today
i
am
sure
he
would
not
say
that
the
full-time
gambler
was
not
in
business.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
carroll
baymiller
yes,
he
is.
in
fact,
he
is
missing
the
day
at
what
he
calls
his
office
this
day.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
