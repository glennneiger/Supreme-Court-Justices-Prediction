mr.
lauber,
you
argued
the
slot
machine
case
last
year,
didn't
you.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
getting
to
be
an
expert
on
gambling
devices.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
this
is
an
income
tax
case
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
taxpayer
who
devotes
his
full
time
to
making
wagers,
gambling
or
the
support
of
himself
in
his
family,
is
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business,
as
those
terms
are
used
in
certain
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
if
he
is
engaged
in
the
trade
or
business
certain
tax
consequences
follow.
if
he
is
not
so
engaged
certain
other
consequences
follow
more
adverse
to
him.
the
courts
of
appeal
have
reached
different
conclusions
on
this
issue
and
hence
we
took
it
to
resolve
the
conflict.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
such
a
taxpayer
who
is
so
engaged
is
in
a
trade
of
business,
and
hence
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
had
ruled
to
that
effect.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
the
the
chief
justice
and
by
justice
scalia.
