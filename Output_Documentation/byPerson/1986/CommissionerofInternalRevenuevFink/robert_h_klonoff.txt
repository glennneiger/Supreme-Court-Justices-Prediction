mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--he
thought,
he
made
the
misjudgment
that
he
had
to
put
down
the
same
date
and
place
of
birth
as
he
had
on
his
passport.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
how
to
balance
two
important
interests,
a
naturalized
citizens
right
to
citizenship
versus
the
government's
need
for
truthful
answers
by
applicants
for
visas
and
for
citizenship.
the
issue
arises
in
the
context
of
the
case
involving
willful
and
deliberate
lies
at
every
stage
of
the
process.
and
in
answer
to
justice
powell's
question
the
record
is
clear
and
it's
been
conceded
throughout
that
these
lies
were
willful,
and
i
would
cite
to
pages
9a
and
46a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
is
absolutely
clear
that
these
were
conceded
to
be
willful.
and
i
will
get,
in
detail,
during
the
course
of
this
argument
to
the
nature
of
these
lies
because,
in
fact,
a
number
of
misstatements
were
given
during
mr.
williamson's
arguments
and
i
want
to
clear
up
precisely
what
the
nature
of
the
misstatements
were
and
how
they
occurred
during
the
proceedings.
the
standard
of
materiality
urged
by
the
government
in
this
case
requires
proof
by
clear
convincing
and
unequivocal
evidence
that
there
would
have
been
an
investigation
and
that
that
investigation
might
have
uncovered
disqualifying
facts.
now
i
think
mr.
williamson
confuses
two
different
issues
here.
he
indicates
that
the
use
of
the
phrase,
"might"
somehow
dilutes
the
clear,
convincing
and
unequivocal
standard.
but,
in
fact,
he's
confusing
two
separate
issues.
for
example,
in
the
criminal
perjury
cases
the
standard
of
proof
is
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
question
of
materiality
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
tendency
to
influence
the
decision-maker
and
the
question
whether
there's
a
tendency
to
influence
the
decision-maker
has
to
be
proven
by
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
we
submit
there's
no
dilution
of
the
proper
standard.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
let
me
say
there
are
four
separate
patterns
of
lies.
it
isn't
just
date
and
place
and
birth.
mr.
williamson,
throughout
the
litigation
and
again
in
this
court,
ignores
what
the
government
believes
to
be
the
most
crucial
lie,
namely
where
the
petitioner
was
during
the
time
of
the
atrocities.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
the
court
of
appeals
found
date
and
place
of
birth
alone
to
be
enough,
the
analysis
that
we--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
submit
that
that's
correct.
xxx.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
first
of
all
and
this
goes
also
to
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
whether
or
not
there
was
an
error
of
law
or
an
error
of
fact.
what
the
district
court
did
is
it
said,
let's
look
at
a
fact
in
isolation
per
se.
for
example,
if
someone
came
in
and
said,
i
was
born
in
1915,
are
you
disqualified
based
on
that
fact
per
se?
if
that
were
the
analysis,
then
virtually
no
fact
of
identity
would
be
material.
for
example,
somebody
could
come
in
and
give
a
totally
fictitious
name,
but
then
when
it--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--[inaudible].
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
what
happens
justice
scalia,
the
way
this
process
works
is
first
the
applicant
provides
documentation,
he
then
fills
out
the
application
forms
and
he's
then
interviewed
under
oath
and
given
the
information
and
the
testimony
in
terms
of
triggering
an
investigation
which
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
said
was
undisputed
is
where
the
person,
well,
first
provides--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
we're
not
suggesting
that.
nowhere
in
the
record
does
the
district
court
indicate
that
it
disbelieved
[inaudible].
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
what
the
district
court
did
wrong,
we
would
submit,
is
not
looking
at
discrepancies
created
by
later
lies.
what
vice
counsel
finger
explained
is--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--but,
with
all
respect,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
district
court
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
the
discrepancies
at
all.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
the
district
court
certainly
could
have
disbelieved
finger.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
correct.
what
we're
doing,
we're
reviewing
the
record
as
to
the
analyses
undertaken
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
but
the
district
court
did
not
specifically
refuse
to
rely
on
it.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
it
could
have.
but,
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
was
an
error
of
law,
in
other
words,
that
vice
counsel
finger
explained
that
the
way
the
process
worked
is--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
that's
correct.
and
perhaps
on
an
issue
where
the
district
court
didn't
address
this
precise
issue,
perhaps
one
approach
could
be
for
this
court
to
remand
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
district
court
specifically
address--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that
is
correct.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
basis
in
viewing
the
record
to
be
undisputed
on
these
particular
points
and
therefore--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
it
means
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
no,
i
understand
that.
and
i
would
just
again
reiterate
that
there
was
no
finding
that
vice
counsel
finger
was
not
credible.
but
in
any
event,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
the
course
of
investigation
would
have
been
triggered
by
an
inconsistency
between
the
earlier
lie
and
the
later
telling
of
the
truth
because
at
each
stage
of
the
process
the
individual
is
asked
to
provide
this
biographical
information.
and
having
supplied
false
documents,
if
he
then
comes
in
and
gives
the
truth
an
investigation
would
be
triggered
and
it
was
required
by
regulation
as
a
result
of
the
inconsistency
of
this
basic
biographical
information.
the
same
thing
is
true
within
that
organization.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
right.
or,
goldberg.
and
as
to
justice
goldberg,
the
district
court
didn't
discuss
the
evidence
at
all.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
correct.
we
don't
disagree
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
exactly.
that's
a
fact.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
exactly.
but,
first
of
all--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that's
correct.
in
taurage.
and
that's
correct.
those
are
two--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
we
submit
that
that's
not
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
again,
first
of
all
at
the
visa
stage
there
was
a
requirement
that
people
tell
the
truth
about
biographical
information.
this
was
supported
by
the
case
law
at
the
time.
and
so
the
very
discovery
of
the
discrepancy
would
have
disqualified
the
applicant
from
obtaining
a
visa.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
what
the
[inaudible]--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
that'
not,
it's
much
narrower
than
that.
the
cases
deal
at
that
time
specifically
with
identity
with
information
that
congress
specifically
required
that
an
applicant
provide
as
to
those
specific
pieces
of
information.
the
case
law
at
the
time
was
quite
clear
that
it
was
per
se
grounds
for
denial.
so
that's
just
one
avenue.
let
me
explore
your
question
further.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
the
cases
held
that
because
identity
was
so
fundamental
to
the
inquiry
of
investigation
that
misstatements
of
identify
were
in
essence
deemed
material
per
se.
only
a
small
category
of
misstatements
known
as
identity.
but,
let
me
pursue
it
further
because
wholly
apart
from
the
identity
point
there
are
additional
avenues,
one
of
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
went
off
on,
the
fact
that
the
investigation
would
have
revealed
that
the
petitioner
was
not
a
victim
of
persecution
and
that
this
was
a
requirement
at
the
time.
now,
we
would
note
in
that
regard
first
of
all
that
we
conceded
hat--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
it
was--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--and
again,
i
would
note
to
the
court
that
if
the
question
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
this
type
of
issue
should
have
been
dealt
with
first
in
the
first
instance
by
the
district
court
that
that
maybe
the
procedure
to
have
dealt
with.
but,
i'm
just
answering,
in
terms
of
the
remand,
but
i'm
answering
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
avenues
of
investigation.
and
if
we
can
assume
for
a
moment
that
vice
counsel
finger
was
correct,
and
if
we've
noted
in
our
brief
and
supported
historically
by
the
actual
numbers
of
the
visas,
virtually
all
of
the
visas
at
the
time
in
this
part
of
the
world
were
going
to
jews
who
by
definition,
were
victims
of
persecution.
petitioner
himself
provided
the
most
important
evidence
of
the
existence
of
the
requirement.
he
submitted
a
document
for
the
very
purpose
of
proving
that
he
was
a
victim
of
persecution.
and
finally,
petitioner
offered
evidence
at
trial,
a
mr.
zabarskis,
who
had
testified
that
he
was
not
a
victim
of
persecution,
but
nonetheless
got
a
visa.
but
as
the
government
showed,
he
too
represented
himself
to
be
a
victim
of
persecution.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
because
what
vice
counsel
finger
indicated
is
that
if
a
discrepancy
develops
between
a
document
and
the
other
information,
the
first
thing
that
will
be
done
is
to
look
at
the
police
records
in
the
city
of
prior
residence
of
the
individual.
that
investigation,
we
submit,
would
have
uncovered
the
documentation
indicating
first
of
all
that
petitioner
was
living
without
restriction
in
nazi
germany.
secondly,
the
very
identity
of
the
false
date
and
place
of
birth
would
of
revealed
to
the
vice
counsel
that
the
document--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--yes,
i
mean,
well--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
if
we
don't,
two
things:
first
of
all,
if
the
court
is
not
prepared
to
rely
on
vice
counsel
finger
and
goldberg
we
would
submit
that
the
proper
approach
would
be
to
properly
define
the
test
of
materiality
and
then
to
remand
so
that
the
district
court
can
consider
these
issues
in
the
first
instance.
district
court
is
really
never
considered
the
issue
of
discrepancy
for
example.
it
has
never
really
considered--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
or
that
not
necessarily
is
a
matter
of
statute.
we
concede
there's
no
statute
of
regulation--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that's
not
critical
since
we've
given
several
other
possible
grounds
of
investigation.
one
of
which
is,
by
the
way,
under
the
"would
and
might"
standard
that
the
investigation
would
have
led
to
an
investigation
that
might
have
shown
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
a
persecutor,
or
committed
the
war
crime--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
that's
correct.
his--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
we
don't
think
so.
we
think
that
there's
considerable
content
to
the
1961.
that
"might"
requires
some
showing
of
a
basis
for
ultimate
disqualification.
it
doesn't
require
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
but
it
requires
a
considerable
showing.
here
we
have
petitioner
lying
about
the
very
fact
of
where
he
lived
during
the
war.
that's
the
fact
that
the
district
court
found
for
the
government.
that
is
some
support
although
the--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that's
correct.
that
even
the
government
didn't
prove--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
we
don't
think
so.
but,
even
though
the
government--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--enough
to
raise
a
serious
question
about
whether,
in
fact,
the
government
could
have
made
its
case.
let
me
further
answer
though
your
question
about--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
would
think
that
reasonable
standard--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
would
think,
once
we've
first
shown
that
there
would
have
been
an
investigation.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
let
me
first
though
if
i
could--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well
again,
the
vice
counsel
would
have
found
through
the
discrepancies
that
petitioner
lied
about
the
very
place
he
was
during
the
atrocities.
the
investigation
as
the
evidence
indicates,
would
have
led
the
vice
counsel
to
the
displaced
person's
camp
where
there
were--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--taurage
[inaudible].
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
that's
correct.
but
this
is--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
that's
not
the
point.
if
he
lied
about
where
he
was
no
one
in
the
place
where
he
claims
to
have
been
would
be
able
to
link
to
him
to
atrocities
there.
so
no
one
could
prove
that
he
committed
atrocities
in
telsiai.
but,
let
me
just
move
back
briefly
to
the
question
about
whether
or
not
the
case
depends
on
vice
counsel
finger
and
vice
counsel
goldberg.
we've
also
given
an
alternative
analysis
that
doesn't
depend
specifically
on
the
acceptance
of
that
testimony
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
issue
of
good
moral
character.
and
we
would
submit
that
without
regard
at
all
to
the
credibility
findings
that
are
made
that
an
individual
who
lies
repeatedly
on
these
critical
types
of
facts
has
demonstrated
a
lack
of
good
moral
character
under
the
statute
and
that
would
provide
a
basis
for
disqualification.
let
me--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
the
courts
dealt
with
it
and
they
dealt
with
it,
both
of
them
rejected
it.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
they
did
not.
they,
both
the
third
circuit
and
the
district
court
rejected
that
argument.
they
held
that
for
purposes
of
good
moral
character,
the
chaunt
materiality
standard
applies
in
that
context.
if
i
could
very
briefly--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well
there's
a
difference
and
there's
a
question
of
overlap.
we're
not
saying
that
any
lie,
regardless
of
its
significance
is
enough
to
show
that
you
lack
good
moral
character.
what
we're
saying
is,
is
that
here
in
the
context
of
lies
that
could
have
proven
a
basis
for
perjury,
and
we
cite
the
ramos
case
for
example,
that
where
somebody
has
repeatedly
committed
perjury
that
he
has
demonstrated
a
lack
of
good
moral
character.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
but
the
materiality
test,
again,
this
assumes
just
hypothetically,
regardless
of
whatever
the
court
adopts
with
respect
to
chaunt,
the
materiality
test
in
the
perjury
context
is
well-established.
and
that
requires
only
that
there
be
a
tendency
to
influence
the
decision-maker
and
we
suggest
that
under
that
test
of
materiality
it's
clear
the
petitioner's
lies
were
material
for
criminal
purposes.
so,
regardless
of
the
chaunt
test,
we
would
submit
that
somebody
who
is
engaged
in
repeated
acts
of
perjury
has
established
a
lack
of
good
moral
character.
let
me
briefly,
if
i
could,
review
the
entire
scenario
of
misstatements
because
they
really
are
quite
dramatic
in
the
context
of
this
case.
petitioner
repeatedly
lied
about
his
identity
at
the
very
time
he
was
telling
the
truth
to
the
germans.
and
it's
simply
not
correct
as
petitioner
would
indicate
that
he
also
lied
to
the
nazi
germans.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
117a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
where
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
all
of
the
documents
reflected
the,
that
were
submitted
to
the
germans,
both
nazi
and
after,
reflected
his
true
place
of
birth
and
almost
all
reflected
his
true
date
of
birth.
so,
clearly
he
was
giving
truthful
information
to
the
germans.
it
was
also
found
as
a
fact
that
he
had
a
identifying
document
on
him
with
a
true
place
of
birth
and
that
he
didn't
disclose
that
document
to
the
immigration
officials.
now,
his
explanation
that
he's
given,
namely
avoiding
conscription
into
the
german
army
simply
makes
no
sense
because
it
doesn't
explain
why
he
would
tell
the
truth
to
the
germans
and
then
lie
to
the
american
officials.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
the
theory
we've
had--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--throughout
this
case,
as
is
typical
of
many
of
the
cases
that
have
been
brought
in
this
area,
people
are
trying
to
shade
their
identities
so
that
they
can
not
be
linked
with
certain
atrocities.
and
that
goes
hand
and
hand--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
but
if,
for
example,
someone
came
in
later
and
provided
testimony
that
the
person
who
they
saw
and
they
knew
of
who
committed
the
atrocities
was
the
person
who
was
born
in
so
and
so
town,
he
can
come
in
having
lied
and
said,
well
that's
not
me,
i
was
born
in
a
different
place
and
i
have
a
different
year
of
birth.
but,
certainly
the
most
critical
lie,
we
have
submitted,
is
his
lie
about
his
residence
during
the
war.
and
his
lie
has
been
really
a
spectrum
of
lies
because
he
told
the
immigration
officials
at
the
visa
stage
that
he
had
not
resided
in
kadainiai.
for
a
two
year
period,
he
listed
just
telsiai.
he
kept
changing
around
so
that
by
the
time
the
investigation
occurred
of
this
case
he
admitted
that
he
was
there
until
the
beginning
of
july,
but
left
right
before
the
atrocities.
and
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
he
was
there
until
october
of
1941
and,
therefore,
was
there
during
the
time
the
atrocities
occurred.
and
finally,
he
lied
about
his
occupation,
and
there,
there's
further
testimony.
vice
counsel
finger
indicated
that
at
a
minimum,
had
an
individual
come
in
and
represented
that
he
had
worked
in
this
plant
manager
capacity,
even
of
say
15
employees,
that
would
have
triggered
further
questioning
by
the
vice
counsel.
now,
if
i
could
just
discuss
briefly
the
general
considerations
concerning
the
test
of
materiality.
we
would
submit
that
the
government's
test
of
materiality,
the
test
we
urge
is
the
proper
one
that
this
court
should
adopt
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
petitioner's
standard
of
materiality
creates
an
incentive
for
visa
and
citizenship
applicants
to
lie
and
then
later
rewards
the
person
for
his
successful
lies.
and
many
of
the
questions
that
the
court
is
asking
today,
it's
troublesome
to
know
exactly
what
the
line
of
investigation
would
have
been
and
this
is
the
reason
why
a
standard
of
what
counsel
calls
doubt
free
materiality
simply
is
not
right,
because
the
government
was
denied
the
opportunity
back
in
1947,
of
investigating
these
facts.
the
government
has
the
right
to
get
the
true
identity
of
the
person
so
that
it
can
make
the
investigation
at
the
time
and
determine
at
the
time
whether
or
not
the
person
has
the
necessary
requirements.
so
we
submit
that
the
government
standard
properly
balances
those
two
interests.
secondly,--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--our
standard,
justice
white,
is
what
you
suggested
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
fedorenko
that
there
would
have
been
an
investigation
that
might
have
led
to
the
discovery
of
disqualifying
facts
and
that
that
has
to
be
proven
by
clear,
convincing
and
unequivocal
evidence.
and
i
would
say
in
that
regard,
in
addition
to
the
attorney
general
opinion
in
1961
endorsing
that
standard,
virtually
every
court
both
before
and
after
this
court's
chaunt
decision
has
endorsed
that
standard.
the
only
exception
is
a
split
decision
by
the
10th
circuit
and
some
dictum
by
the
9th
circuit.
but,
beyond
that
the
endorsement
for
this
point
of
view
has
been
sweeping
and
virtually
unanimous
by
the
courts
who
recognize
exactly
what
i'm
arguing
today
this
difficult
problem
where
an
individual
lies
about
critical
information,
who
he
is,
and
then
tries
to
come
in
later
after
he's
gotten
his
citizenship
through
the
lie
and
then
said,
well
united
states
you
can't
show
precisely
what
an
investigation
would
have
uncovered
40
years
ago.
that's
the
problem
with
the
very
standard
that
the
petitioner
urges.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
there's
a
question,
justice
scalia,
and
you've
raised
it
there
that
one
of
the
requirements
is
that
the
statement
be
willful
and
that
it
be
willful
in
a
sense
of
trying
to
deceive
the
immigration
officials,
so
somebody
who's
lying
for
vanity
purposes
or
whatever--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
we
think
so.
let's
take--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--i
don't
know
how
common
mr.
kungys
name
is
at
the
time,
but
let's
take
the
name
john
smith.
if
somebody
lies
about
their
date
and
place
of
birth
it
is
absolutely
meaningless
to
give
a
name
john
smith.
you
just
cannot
do
any
investigation
of
who
that
person
is,
so
we
would
submit
that
the
date
and
place
of
birth
are
crucial.
congress
specified
them.
the
very
beginning
of
the
statute
that
we
have
quoted
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
congress
listed
only
a
few
items
that
they
required
of
all
applicants
and
date
and
place
of
birth
were
among
them.
and
the
courts,
as
we've
said,
have
given
specific
attention
to
the
identity
issue.
the
second
point
in
terms
of--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--not
at
all.
we
submit
that
the
test
we're
proposing
is
a
faithful
interpretation
of
chaunt
and
in
fact,
the
cases
that
we've
cited
post
chaunt
are
relying
on
the
literal
language
of
the
second
chaunt
prong.
so,
we
submit
that
and
this
is
entirely
consistent
with
justice
douglas'
concern
in
his
opinion
that
visa
and
citizenship
applicants
tell
the
truth.
that
truthfulness
is
a
fundamental
part
of
the
immigration
system
and
that
a
standard
that
gives
no
attention
to
that
whatsoever
is
one
that
really
is
unworkable.
now
related
to
my
first
point
in
terms
of
the
incentive
to
lie
is
the
fact
that
once
there
is
a
lie,
either
at
the
visa
or
the
citizenship
stage
you
have
deprived
the
government
officials
of
the
opportunity
to
do
their
job
properly.
they
simply
cannot
investigate
an
individual's
bonafides
if
the
standard
that's
endorsed
is
one
that
essentially
says,
which
is
what
petitioner's
standard
would
do,
that
you
can
give
a
completely
false
identity,
because
that
would
be
the
effect
of
endorsing
the
"would-would"
standard.
you
could
give
a
completely
false
identify
because
no
one
could
say
40
years
later
that
had
i
given
a
true
name,
or
had
i
given
a
true
date
of
birth
those
facts
per
se
would
have
disqualified
me.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
let
me
say,
the
"would-might"
standard--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well
we've
suggested--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we've
suggested
that
as
an
analogy,
in
fact,
the
would-might
standard
is
more
stringent
than
the
standard
in
the
criminal
context.
the
criminal
context
only
requires
that
there
be
a
tendency
to
influence
the
decision-maker.
the
government
standard
is
requiring
that
there
would
have
been
an
investigation,
not
only
that
there
might
have
been
or
that
there
would
be
a
tendency
to.
and,
in
fact,
one
case,
the
sixth
circuit
kassab
decision
specifically
endorsed
a
"might-might"
standard
which
is
more
comparable
to
the
criminal
law.
but,
let
me
just
say
we
would
have
no
objection
whatsoever
if
this
court
endorsed
as
the
standard
of
materiality
in
this
context,
the
standard
that's
applied
in
the
perjury
context
and
perhaps
that
would
be
a
way
to
rid
some
of
the
confusion
of
this
area
by
having
a
two
prong
standard--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that
would
be--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
the
vice
counsel
testified,
both
he
himself
would
investigate
plus
he
had
employees
who
would
do
it.
they
would
interview
people
at
displaced
persons
camp,
they
would
go
to
the
police
records
of
the
individual's
prior
residence,
they
would
look
at
prior
applications.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
these
were
not
large
staffs
and
it's
critical
to
note
that
these
people
relied
on
the
truthfulness
of
the
applicants.
there
simply
were
not
the
resources
to
go
out
and
conduct
a
massive
investigation
for
each
applicant.
and
that
again
is
a
further
reason--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--he
would
have
done
some,
or
he
had
staff
who
assisted
him
in
that
regard.
and
it
was
sort
of
an
ad
hoc
decision-making
process.
there's
not
a
lot
in
the
record
on
the
specifics.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
he
testified
quite
clearly
that
if
he
had
found
a
discrepancy--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--in
biographical
information
he
would
have
referred
the
case
to
the
immigration
officials
for
deportation
proceedings.
so
the
naturalization
examiner
wouldn't
personally
be
involved,
but
the
investigation
would
be
a
government
investigation
into
possible
prosecution
of
a
deportation.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
so
that's
how
it
would
work
in
that
context.
let
me
just
make
a
couple
of
other
points
and
both
of
these,
by
the
way,
are
fully
supported
by
a
standard
of
materiality
that
endorses
the
criminal
standard.
the
standard
the
petitioner
proposes
is
more
onerous
than
in
any
other
area
of
the
law,
criminal,
civil,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
tsc
case
for
example,
the
tort
examples.
in
no
other
context
is
there
a
requirement
that
you
prove
an
ultimate
disqualifying
fact.
now
since
congress
did
not
define
materiality
in
the
statute,
principals
of
statutory
construction
would
suggest
that
you
would
go
to
well-established
meanings
of
the
term
such
as
the
criminal
context.
you
would
not
start
from
scratch
and
propose
a
definition
that
has
absolutely
no
support
anywhere
in
the
law.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
if
this
were
a
well-established,--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--if
this
were
a
legitimate
policy--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well
that's
not,
i
mean,
that
is
not
a
legitimate
policy
carrying
out
the
intent
of
the
regulation.
our
point
is--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--the
emphasis
in
the
regulation,
i
would
ask
that--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that's
not
an
effort
to
further
the
effort
the
concern
of
congress
and
the
president
to
try
to
get
the
neediest
people
visas.
what
finger
is
talking
about
is
a
sub-category
where
you
identify
the
most
needy
people
and
you
say
that
these
people
who
have
been
victims
of
persecution
are
going
to
be
the
one,
the
court
has
to
remember
there
were
many,
many
people
applying
for
visas.
way
more
than
were
eligible
under
the
quota
system
and
therefore,
a
decision
on
meade
had
to
be
made.
and
we
would
simply
ask
therefore,
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
