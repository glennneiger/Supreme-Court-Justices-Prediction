unknown
speaker
you
say
a
standard
that
is
doubt
free,
mr.
williamson?
unknown
speaker
is
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
being
doubt
free.
unknown
speaker
well,
clear
and
convincing
has
been
thought
of
a
standard
between
a
preponderance
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
unknown
speaker
mr.
williamson?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
one
of
your
points
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
engaged
in
improper
fact
finding
under
our
icicle
seafoods
decision
of
last
term.
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
going
to
discuss
that
in
your
oral
argument?
unknown
speaker
i
would
find
it
helpful,--
unknown
speaker
--i
would
agree
with
the
chief
justice
on
that.
i
would
like
to
have
you
comment.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
did
the
third
circuit
find
that
clearly
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
i
was
curious
about
that
too.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
treated
his
testimony
as
if
it
had
to
be
believed.
and
i
thought
the
district
court
could
totally
disbelieve
the
testimony
of
any
witness
whether
interested,
or
not.
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
if
it's
essentially
a
question
of
a
fact--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
have
to
prove
you're
right.
all
you
have
to
prove
is
there
was
a
dispute
which
the
district
court
was
entitled
to
resolve
either
way.
unknown
speaker
i'm
interested
in
that.
was
in
fact
no
regulation
in
existence?
unknown
speaker
even
though
ambassador
finger,
then
vice
counsel
said
he
was
relying
on
one.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
remains
a
puzzlement
what
it
was
that
the
government
did
show
mr.
finger,
or
whether
he
just--
unknown
speaker
--or
if
they
showed
him
anything.
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
also
testimony
by,
was
it
the
counsel
at
the
time,
who
had
no
recollection
of
any
such--
unknown
speaker
--policy.
unknown
speaker
the
transcript
of
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
williamson,
may
i
come
back
to
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
do
you
deny
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
knowingly
lied
every
time
he
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
you
do?
unknown
speaker
didn't
he
have
the
correct
documents
in
his
possession
and
didn't
he
falsify
the
documents
he
filed
and
signed,
swore
to?
xxx.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
you
[inaudible]--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
interrupt
you
now?
unknown
speaker
and
those
misstatements
were
wilfully
and
knowingly
made?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
he
just
wanted
to
be
a
united
states
citizen.
unknown
speaker
but
that
wasn't
the
application
for
the
visa.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
justice
powell
was
talking
about
the
application
for
the
visa.
unknown
speaker
but,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
going
in
the
military
did
it?
unknown
speaker
he
was
[inaudible].
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
to
tell
a
deliberate
lie
is
a
misjudgment?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
a
fact
that
he
didn't
want
to
be
found
out
to
have
murdered
4,000
people?
unknown
speaker
xxx
lie.
unknown
speaker
mr.
williamson,
let
me
get
it
clear
why
you
say
he
was
misrepresenting.
you
say
that
he
thought
that
the
best
documentation
that
he
had
available
was
his
lithuanian
passport
so
he
recited
the
date
and
place
of
birth
that
was
on
that?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
he
use
the
same
reasoning
when
he
gave
testimony
to
the
german
officials
for
the
other
documents
that
contained
the
correct
date
and
place
of
birth?
unknown
speaker
after
the
allied
occupation?
unknown
speaker
all
the
documentation
that
shows
the
correct
date
and
place
of
birth
is
after
the
allied
occupation?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
williamson.
unknown
speaker
we'll
here
now
from
you
mr.
klonoff.
unknown
speaker
what
would,
might,
whatever,
tell
me
why
the
listing
of
birth
date
two
years
earlier
and
a
different
location
in
the
country
instead
of
in
the
city
of
kaunas
would
have
provoked
an
investigation.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
about
the
date
and
place
of
birth
alone?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
your
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
that
have
led
to
an
investigation
as
justice
scalia
asked?
unknown
speaker
you
tell
me
how
it
would
have
led
to
investigation?
granted
that
it
wouldn't
have
disqualified
him
and
you
need
not
show
that
it
would
have
disqualified
him
automatically.
unknown
speaker
how
would
it
have
led
to
an
investigation?
somebody
would
say,
ah
ha,
he
was
not
born
in
1933,
he
was
born
in
'31.
that
will
set
me
to,
why
would
that
set
anybody
to
investigate?
unknown
speaker
you
said
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
undisputed,
but
are
you
suggesting
that
the
district
court
doesn't
have
the
right
to
disbelieve
someone's
testimony
just
because
there
isn't
any
contradictory
testimony?
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
district
court
have
to
indicate
that
it
disbelieves?
so
long
as
it
didn't
make
a
finding
in
accordance
with
that
testimony
the
district
court
may
have
disbelieved
it.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
think
the
finger
testimony
doesn't
do
you
any
good
at
all
up
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
but,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
may
be
right
as
to
the
discrepancies,
but
i
don't
think
you
have
any
business
relying
up
here
on
any
of
the
explanations
of
vice
counsel
finger.
because
the
district
court
was
free
to
disbelieve
him.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
the
district
court
was
not
free
to
disbelieve
finger?
unknown
speaker
well
okay
then
why
are
you
relying
on
what
he
said
in
your
explanation.
because
the
district
court
could
have
disbelieved
him.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
suggest
you
not
rely
on
the
finger
testimony.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
agree
it
could
have
disbelieved
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
again,
you're
relying
on
his
testimony.
the
district
court
could
have
found
his
testimony
totally
false.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
icicle
seafood
says,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
what
does
undisputed
mean?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
isn't
the
testimony
you,
that
isn't
the
way
you
ordinarily
review
a
district
court
finding
of
fact.
you
can
say
the
testimony
of
witness
a
before
the
district
court
was
undisputed.
nobody
contradicted
this
witness,
and
yet
if
the
district
court,
sitting
as
a
fact
finder,
says,
i
don't
believe
a
word
that
witness
says,
the
fact
that
the
witness
was
undisputed
doesn't
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
if
you
believe
finger?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
no
reason
for
the
district
court
to
be
required
to
believe
justice
goldberg,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
see,
i
still
don't
understand
this.
you
mean,
since
he
lied
the
first
time
in
the
visa
application,
had
he
told
the
truth
the
second
time
in
the
naturalization
application,
the
inconsistency
between
the
two
would
have
set
an
investigation
afoot.
unknown
speaker
and
that
investigation
would
of
looked
into
why.
why
is
that
the
man
said
that
he
was
born
in
1931
when
he
was
born
in
1933?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
it
that
he
said
he
was
born
in
kaunas
instead
of,
where
was
he
born?
unknown
speaker
so
what?
what
would
that
investigation
have
led
to?
absolutely
nothing.
unknown
speaker
those
specific
facts
couldn't
make
any
difference
at
all.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you're
saying
any,
oh,
you
are
eliminating
therefore
the
requirement
which
i
thought,
i
thought
the
case
has
established
up
to
now
that
any
misrepresentation
has
to
be
not
only
willful,
but
material
in
order
to
disqualify.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying,
if
we
find
somebody
making
a
willful
misrepresentation
whether
it's
material
or
not,
whether
it
would
have
caused
him
to
be
disqualified
from
naturalization
or
from
a
visa,
or
not,
it's
enough.
unknown
speaker
wait,
excuse
me.
it
was
per
se
grounds
of
denial.
any
misrepresentation
whether
it
was
material,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
is
that
uncontested
that
it
was
required
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
finger
said.
nobody
else
said.
substantiated
by
a
regulation
which
didn't
exist.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i
still
don't
understand
how
all
of
this
ties
into
the
birth
date
and
the
place
of
birth.
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
whether
he's
a
victim
of
persecution,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
klonoff,
does
the
government's
case
here
depend
on
accepting
the
truth
of
the
statements
of
finger
and
goldberg?
unknown
speaker
the
judgment
ought
to
be
reversed
or
vacated
if
you
don't
rely
on
their
statements?
unknown
speaker
xxx.
is
it
not
also
critical
of
the
government's
case
that
not
being
a
victim
of
persecution
is
a
disqualifying
fact?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
a
fact
you
would
have
prevented
him
from
getting
a
visa
had
it
been
known?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
wanted
to
find
out.
you
are
relying
on
a
reading
of
the
standard
which
would
allow,
even
though
it
had
not
been
proved
that
he
was
such
a
persecutor,
what
you're
saying
is
there
might
be
some
other
evidence
out
there
that
might
have
been
discovered
that
might
have
shifted
the
scales
on
the
fact
issue
and
might
have
led
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
in
fact
a
persecutor?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
always
true?
i
mean,
in
unsettled
conditions
in
europe
there
that
if
you
use
the
"might"
language
literally
it's
all,
once
you
get
over
the
hurdle
of
saying
you
would
have
triggered
an
investigation
would
you
not
always
win
on
the
ground
that
they
might
have
found
something
disqualifying?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
they
might
have
discovered
evidence
that
would
have
corroborated
evidence
that
was
otherwise
insufficient?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
they
get
a
little
evidence
of
persecution,
you'd
always
pass
that
"might"
hurdle,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
much
evidence
do
you
have
to
have
on
that
issue
of
persecution?
unknown
speaker
reasonable
suspicion
enough,
or
probable
cause?
what
is
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
if
there's
reasonable
suspicion
that
he
was
engaged
in
this
kind
of
activity,
you
satisfied
the
"might"
hurdle.
unknown
speaker
right.
once
you
say
you
would
have
triggered
some
kind
of
an
investigation--
unknown
speaker
--found
the
reasonable
suspicion
here.
what
would
have
justified
that
reasonable
suspicion?
unknown
speaker
were
there
no
atrocities
in
the
place
where
he
said
he
was?
i
mean,
you
know,
you
mentioned,
what's
the
name
of
that
city
where--
unknown
speaker
--there
were
atrocities
all
over
lithuania.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean,
you
can
always
say,
yeah,
he
lied
because
he,
you
know,
are
you
sure
the
city
he
said
he
was
in
didn't
have
atrocities
as
well?
unknown
speaker
did
the
courts
below
rely
on
that?
unknown
speaker
did
they
rely
on
that
as
a
basis
for
denaturalization?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
materiality
standard
if
you
adopt
that
position?
that
is,
the
lie
has
to
be
material,
but
of
course,
anybody
who
lies
doesn't
have
good
moral
character,
so
a
lie
doesn't
have
to
be
material.
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
need
a
materiality
standard?
unknown
speaker
well
what
makes
it
perjury
as
opposed
to
just
a
lie
if
it
isn't
materiality?
unknown
speaker
why
did
he
lie
to
the
american
officials?
what's
your
theory
about
why
he
lied
to
the
american
officials
and
told
them
he
was
born--
unknown
speaker
--two
years
later,
or
earlier.
unknown
speaker
but,
he
wasn't
born
where
the,
you
know,
if
he
had
been
born
where
the
atrocities
occurred,
i
could
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
but,
neither
the
place
where
he
actually
was
born,
nor
the
place
where
he
said
he
was
born
was
the
place
where
the
atrocities
occurred.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
i
know
a
lit
of
people
who
misrepresent
their
birth
date
and
i
really
don't
consider
that
they're
misrepresenting
who
they
are.
that's
a
little--
unknown
speaker
--it's
a
different
point
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
hyperbolic
to
say
that
someone
who
gives
the
wrong
birth
date,
or
for
that
matter
a
wrong
town
of
birth
is
misrepresenting
who
they
are.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
xxx
asking
us
to
overrule
or
cut
back
on
chaunt?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
use
the
standard
that's
used
for
the
criminal
statute
1001?
i
mean,
apart
from
the
fact
that
you
have
one
vote
here
for
"would-might"
which
i
don't
denigrate.
i
mean,
that's--
unknown
speaker
--a
good
reason
but
why
don't
you
use
the
one
that
we
have
a
lot
of
case
law
on?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
perjury
statute?
unknown
speaker
does
the--
unknown
speaker
--does
the
record
in
this
case
tell
us
who
made
the
investigations
in
germany
at
the
time?
say
that,
you
say
there
would
have
been
an
investigation
triggered.
what
would
the
counsel's
office
have
done?
unknown
speaker
how
big
a
staff
did
he
have?
unknown
speaker
but
basically,
the
vice
counsel
himself
would
of
gone
out
and
checked
the
records
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
and
what
about
it,
with
reference
to
judge
goldberg's
testimony?
if
he
had
thought
an
investigation
was
necessary
what
would
the
naturalization
judge
do?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
klonoff,
before
you
get
off,
one
thing's
troubling
me
about,
let's
assume
that
finger's
testimony
is
properly
evaluated
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
assume
that
we
can't
find
any
regulation,
which
you
haven't
been
able
to,
that
says
it's
only
victims
of
nazi
persecution
who
would
have
been
admitted
on
a
visa.
unknown
speaker
now
you
say,
nonetheless,
it
would
have
been
a
relevant
misrepresentation
if
finger,
on
his
own
was
using
that
as
a
criteria.
that
would
be
enough
to
render
the
misrepresentation
which
would
have
shown
that
he
was
not
a
victim
of
nazi
persecution
relevant--
unknown
speaker
--yeah.
unknown
speaker
well-established.
suppose
it
were
well-established
that
finger
was
giving
preference
to
blue-eyed
people
and
was
not
allowing
any
brown-eyed
people
in
and
he
writes
down
blue
eyes
on
the
thing.
unknown
speaker
nor
was
fingers
if
the
regulation
doesn't
say
there's
a
preference
or
the
victim
is
not--
unknown
speaker
--what
do
you
do
with
my
hypothetical?
clearly
not
a
relevant
misrepresentation,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
klonoff.
mr.
williamson
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
williamson,
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
