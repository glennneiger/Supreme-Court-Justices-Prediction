mr.
donald
j.
williamson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
denaturalization
case
raises
the
issue
as
to
how
to
determine
the
materiality,
or
lack
of
materiality
of
a
misrepresentation
in
a
visa
application
and
a
petition
for
naturalization
when
the
truth
would
not
have
resulted
in
the
ineligibility
of
the
naturalized
citizen
for
either
a
visa
or
for
citizenship.
here
the
third
circuit
transformed
the
immaterial
misrepresentations
of
date
and
town
of
birth
by
applying
evidentiary
standard
less
than
and
inconsistent
with
that
required
by
the
long-standing
requirement
of
schneiderman
of
an
evidentiary
standard
of
proof
that
is
doubt
free.
and
it
applied
that
diluted
standard
to
reach
a
non-existent
ultimate
disqualifying
fact.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
doubt
free.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
it
is
at
least,
according
to
this
court
in
[inaudible]
the
equivalent
of
the
criminal
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
the
language
of
clear,
convincing
and
unequivocal
which
does
not
leave
any
issue
in
doubt,
i
would
characterize
as
doubt
free.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
but,
this
court
went
further
in
schneiderman
to
indicate
that
it
not
only
has
to
be
clear,
convincing
and
unequivocal,
but
it
will
leave
no
issue
in
doubt
and
any
inference
of
fact
or
law
as
far
as
reasonably
as
possible
it
should
be
drawn
in
favor
of
the
citizen.
but,
i
would
argue
in
terms
of
the
application
to
this
case
that
doubt
free
is
more
of
a
short
end
expression
in
my
having
to
completely
repeat
each
time
that
language
of
the
court.
but
nevertheless,
if
we're
to
take
literally
the
chaunt
second
prong
of
the
second
expression
of
the
second
prong
then
this
court
is
likewise
free
to
take
literally
the
language
in
schneiderman
which
is
doubt
free
and
which
in
the
concurring
opinions
is
fairly
clear
that
this
court
was
trying
to
avoid
any
potentiality
of
having
two
classes
of
citizenship
and
therefore
did
in
fact
make
the
standard
of
proof
as
vigorous
as
possible.
when
the
applications
of
the
fact
to
this
particular
case
the
district
court
was
able
to
apply
all
of
the
formulations
of
chaunt
and
fedorenko,
taken
in
combination,
and
under
none
of
those
standards
did
it
find
the
misrepresentations
to
be
material.
what
happened
here
however
is
that
the
third
circuit
tried
to
get
from
point
a,
the
suppressed
truth
by
drawing
an
inference
as
to
a
residency
permit
in
which
correspondence
indicated
that
it
was
issued
without
special
restrictions
and
from
that
it
drew
a
tendentious
inference
that
that
would
have
led
to
a
conclusion
that
the
naturalized
citizen
was
not
a
victim
of
nazi
persecution.
i
think
we
demonstrate
fairly
clearly
that
the
law
and
the
regulations
at
that
time
had
no
such
requirement
that
one
had
to
be
a
victim
of
nazi
persecution.
so
that
the
ultimate
disqualifying
fact
to
which
the
third
circuit,
i
reach
this
conclusion
is
in
essence
a
false
premise
and
its
logic
was
bound
to
face
since
it
didn't
exist.
but
in
addition
to
which
the
case
illustrates
that
you
cannot
have
a
standard
which
you
can
characterize
as
it
did
as
probability
and
still
in
effect
comply
with
safeguarding
the
rights
of
the
denaturalized
citizens.
because
what
they
did
there
is
they
turned
schneiderman
upside
down
and
instead
of
drawing
the
inferences
in
favor
of
the
citizen
they
draw
the
most
tenuous
inference
in
favor
of
a
government.
in
point
of
fact,
the
inference
is
neutral
because
every
person
whether
or
not
a
citizen
of
germany
at
the
third
reich
at
that
time,
or
even
today,
who
is
in
germany
whether
it
be
a
citizen,
or
displaced
person,
or
foreigner,
has
to
register
and
the
registration
is
a
simple
bureaucratic
act.
all
it
does
is
establish
that
the
neutral
fact
that
one
resided
in
tubingen.
now
the
irony
is
that
the
establishment
of
the
residence
in
poltringen
rather,
at
that
time,
established
that
the
petitioner
was
a
displaced
person
who
was
covered
by
the
presidential
directive
of
december
22nd,
1945.
now
that
was
incorporated
specifically
on
december
of
1946,
in
the
federal
regulations
incorporated
the
truman
directive
as
part
of
the
priority
for
non-preference
immigration
quota
visas.
the
third
circuit
looked
at
the
president
truman
directive
in
isolation
and
did
not
take
into
consideration
that
indeed
it
was
incorporated
in
the
regulations.
as
a
result
of
which
they
came
to
the
improper
conclusion
that
was
a
mere
generalized
statement
instead
of
in
fact
a
presidential
order
directing
that
all
displaced
persons
would,
in
effect,
receive
a
priority
under
a
non-preference
quota
immigration
visa
standard.
this
court
has
never
applied
the
second
prong
of
chaunt
even
in
chaunt.
and
as
a
result
of
which
it
is
dicta
and
i
would
submit
that
if
it
is
to
be
taken
literally,
it
is
impossible
to
reconcile
the
dicta
in
the
second
prong
of
chaunt
with
the
schneiderman
test.
what
has
happened
is
we
have
two
formulations
in
chaunt
within
two
pages.
one
on
page
353
and
one
page
355.
the
latter
one
picks
up
the
word,
"possibly",
and
the
question
has
in
effect,
plagued
the
courts
of
appeals
as
to
how
one
applies
the
test
and
where,
in
effect,
what
part
of
the
phraseology
it
modifies.
whereas
it
is
reasonably
clear
that
in
chaunt
this
court
in
effect
did
say
that
you
had
to
connect
the
suppressed
fact,
there
the
arrests,
to
an
ultimate
disqualifying
fact,
their
communist
affiliation,
and
what
the
court
said
is
that
the
attempted
connection
by
the
government
at
that
time
was
too
tenuous
and
in
addition
to
which
it
said
as
part
of
its
holding
that
no
investigation
would
have
been
conducted
because
there,
there
was
a
disclosure
which,
in
effect,
that
disclosure
did
precipitate
an
investigation.
similarly
here,
although
the
petitioner
did
in
fact
misstate
his
date
and
town
of
birth,
he
disclosed
his
residence
in
poltringen
and
in
tubingen
in
germany
prior
to
the
end
of
the
war.
that
was
disclosed
and
it
did
not
trigger
off
an
investigation
by
the
vice
counsel
to
look
at
the
records
in
tubingen.
but
we
don't
know
that
it
did
not
because
the
vice
counsel
in
effect,
indicates
in
the
application
for
visa,
police
dossier
available.
a
police
dossier
meant
that
they
went
to
the
available
public
records
of
the
jurisdiction
in
which
the
individual
resided.
so
that
presumably
we
would
have
gone
to
poltringen
or
tubingen
and
what
would
they
have
found?
contrary
to
the
indications
of
faulty
review
by
the
third
circuit,
they
would
have
found
the
original
document
which
we
have
in
our
joint
appendix.
that
is
the
original
register
of
ammerbuch,
which
in
effect
is
the
district
which
controlled
the
residential
permits
there.
and
there
it
contains
the
same
information
which
is
reflected
in
the
internal
passport.
it
contains
the
statement
that
he
was
born
in
kaunas
and
born
in
canniest
on
the
incorrect
date.
so
that
in
point
of
fact
there
is
no
connection,
proper
connection
on
the
factual
basis
to
go
from
point
a,
the
truth
of
the
true
date
and
place
of
birth
which
the
district
court
properly
held
would
not
have
led
anywhere
because
that
would
not
have
created
any
type
of
suspicion.
in
addition
to
which
it
could
not
connect
to
something
which
is
the
residence
rather
the
appropriate
fact
was
to
disclose
fact
which
connected
to
the
residence
and
which
is
his
residence
in
poltringen
which
is
on
the
application.
but
in
any
event,
the
whole
exercise
is
an
exercise
in
futility
if
at
the
end
the
ultimate
disqualifying
fact
doesn't
exist.
there
was
no
requirement
that
one
had
to
be
a
victim
of
nazi
persecution
in
order
to
get
a
visa.
and
equally
important
there
is
no
exclusion
which
excludes
someone
who's
not
a
victim
of
nazi
persecution
from
obtaining
a
visa.
this
naturalized
citizen
received
his
visa
under
the
1924
act
and
the
third
circuit
at
least
says
that
you
should
determine
the
validity
of
either
the
visa
or
the
citizenship
petition
judged
by
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
that
he
obtained
it.
under
the
1924
act,
since
he
received
his
visa
in
1948
having
applied
for
it
in
february
of
1947,
the
law
at
that
time
was
that
the
visa
shall
specify
the
nationality,
which
quota
the
immigrant
is
coming
into
and
such
additional
information
necessary
for
the
proper
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws.
and
what
they
provided
for
is
one
form,
but
that
one
form
was
an
attempt
to
cover
many
different
applications.
as
a
result
of
which
some
of
the
questions
that
are
asked
in
the
form
have
no
relevance
or
in
the
standards
here
no
materiality
to
the
ultimate
decision
to
be
arrived
at.
by
way
of
illustration
the
form
requires
that
you
set
forth
your
age.
of
course
the
age
is
relevant
if
you
are
attempting
to
obtain
a
first
preference
because,
excuse
me,
a
second
preference,
obtain
a
second
preference
because
the
second
preference
is
available
to
unmarried
children
under
the
age
of
21
years
old.
obviously
if
the
petitioner
attempted
to
make
himself,
an
alien,
an
unmarried
alien
under
the
age
of
21
years
then
clearly
that
would
have
been
material.
but
the
difference
of
the
two
years
from
30
to
32
years
was
meaningless
piece
of
information.
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
proper
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws
at
that
time.
similarly,
he
did
not
attempt,
for
example,
it
asked
whether
or
not
he's
married
and
indeed
he
disclosed
the
fact
of
his
marriage,
but
that
marriage
had
no
relevance
to
the
non-preference
immigration
quota
visa
which
he
obtained.
although
it
would
have
had
relevance
to
a
first
preference,
so
that
in
point
of
fact
information
is
requested
in
that
form
which
is
not
necessary
to
enforcement
of
the
laws.
in
addition
to
which
the
act
of--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--yes.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
i
believe
that
as
one
of
the
bases
of
which
to
reverse
i
also
believe
that
it
is
a
relevant
consideration
here
because
it
goes
to
the
question
of
the
district
court
applying
each
one
of
the
standards
in
fedorenko
as
particularly
relevant
to
the
opinion
of
justice
white.
xxx.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
all
right.
--speaking
only
for
myself,
if
you
could
point
out
factually,
not
with
theories,
just
where
the
court
of
appeals
went
wrong
in
what
you
claim
to
be
it's
fact
finding?
all
right.
the
district
court
found--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--yes.
the
district
court
found
that
no
investigation
would
have
been
conducted
had
the
truth
of
the
suppressed
facts
been
disclosed.
and
he
obviously
was
not
clearly
erroneous
because
no
suspicion
would
have
been
aroused
by
a
man
who
made
himself
two
years
older,
by
a
man
who
placed
himself
in
a
city
rather
than
a
town
in
lithuania.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
well
the
third
circuit
used
the
language
of
apply
a
clearly
erroneous
test,
but
that's
not
what
they
did.
what
they
did
in
effect
is
to
say
that
an
investigation
would
have
been
conducted
and
the
way
in
which
they
did
it
is
they
looked
to
the
discrepancies
of
the
documents
which
are
ultimately
discovered
and
they
reasoned
backward
from
the
discrepancy
of
the
document
back
from
the
truth.
but,
it's
not
the
consequence
of
the
lie
that's
significant,
it's
the
consequence
of
the
truth.
would
the
truth
have
led
to
an
investigation.
and
that's
what
this
court,
as
i
read
it,
in
fedorenko
said.
would
the
truth,
if
disclosed,
have
led
to
an
investigation?
now
the
reason
why
i
argue,
in
effect,
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
de
novo
finding
is
that
although
when
you
apply
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
it
may
be
that
the
legal
standard
is
something
which
they
could
address
themselves
to.
but
they
cannot
change
the
factual
component
unless
it
is
clearly
erroneous
and
here
they
changed
the
factual
component
of
whether
an
investigation
would
have
been
conducted.
but
if
i
may
also
follow
up
on
the
dissent,
if
you
would,
of
mr.
justice
white
in
fedorenko.
the
district
court
found
that
since
no
investigation
would
have
been
conducted
it
would
have
satisfied
that
test.
but
i
would
also
submit
that
the
test
would
likewise
be
satisfied
because
under
these
particular
circumstances
the
naturalized
citizen
did
rebut
mr.
justice
white's
suggestion
that
if
you
have
a
probability
test
and
it
establishes
a
presumption,
that
presumption
is
a
rebuttable
presumption.
but
nevertheless
you
still
have
to
reach
an
ultimate
disqualifying
fact.
here
the
petitioner
did
rebut
the
presumption
as
to
whether
or
not
one
had
to
be
a
victim
of
nazi
persecution
and
he
did
it
very
simply.
he
did
in
the
first
instance
by
his
cross
examination.
the
third
circuit
reached
the
false
premise
by
examining
only
the
direct
examination
of
former
vice
counsel
finger.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
not
only
could
he,
but
he
did.
now
in
a
very
genteel
way
he
said
that
the
law
and
the
regulations
in
effect
suggest
that
mr.
finger
was
in
error,
but
perhaps
there
was
an
informal
policy.
but
that's
not
what
the
immigration
laws
say.
as
i've
indicated
in
our
joint
appendix
and
also
in
the
attachment
to
the
reply
brief.
the
only
way
in
which
one
could
refuse
a
visa
is
on
grounds
in
the
law
itself
or
in
the
regulations
and
there
they
don't
exist.
and
what
we've--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--credibility.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
and
which
he
resolved
in
favor
of
the
naturalized
citizen.
once
again,
however,
the
third
circuit,
when
you
asked
me
whether
or
not
they
had
made
de
novo
findings,
they
obviously
did
on
the
most
erroneous
of
fashions.
that
is
to
say
they
didn't
look
at
the
cross
examination
and
they
didn't
look
at
the
federal
regulations,
nor
did
they
look
at
the
presidential
directive.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
no
regulations
existence.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
he
said
the
policy
was
embodied
in
the
regulations
which
the
government
attorney
showed
me
during
my
trial
preparations.
there
was
a
three
week
recess
call
in
which
the
government
was
given
the
opportunity
to
produce
that
regulation.
they
didn't,
i
did.
i
produced
the
regulation
which
was
the
one
i
referred
to
in
the
federal
register
of
december
of
1946.
now
in
addition
to
that,
since
that
time
we
have
looked
at
every
conceivable
source
of
historical
evidence
including
the
literature
at
the
time,
including
the
ins
monthly
reviews,
the
contemporaneously
written
articles,
all
of
those
appear
in
the
appendix
of
the
amici
in
support
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
or
if
they
showed
him
anything.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
or,
if
in
effect,
we
have
merely
a
faulty
memory,
in
effect,
he
would
like
to
believe
that
that
was
the
particular
case.
but
obviously
it
didn't
exist
and
there's
no
factual
support
for
his
testimony
which
the
district
court
found
was
in
error.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes,
the
government
in
its--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--brief
says
that
that's
simply
a
telephone
conversation
which
was
in
evidence,
but
it
is
in
evidence
because
the
alternative
that
the
district
court
judge
gave
was,
either
we
adjourn
the
trial
and
go
there
and
take
the
deposition
of
mr.
schilling,
or
we
take
his
deposition
by
telephone
with
me
listening,
or
in
effect
you
agree
that
the
transcript
goes
in
without
cross
examination.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
the
transcript
of
the
telephone
conversation
i
had
with
mr.
schilling
who
was
the
individual
actually
processed
the
naturalized
citizen's
petition,
visa
petition
which
the
government
chose
not
to
use,
instead
to
use
mr.
finger.
presumably
the
bases
for
not
using
him
was
mr.
schilling
was
uncooperative
and
had
no
memory
and
in
effect
what
we
have
instead
is
mr.
finger
who
was
cooperative
and
had
a
memory
of
something
which
doesn't
exist
and
never
existed
and
there's
no
support
for.
in
addition
to
which
the
government
has
not
produced
a
refusal
card.
if
in
fact,
the
absence
of
being
a
victim
of
nazi
persecution
was
a
disqualifying
fact
then
there
would
be
refusal
cards
which
would
show
that
as
to
some
individuals.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
oh,
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
i
do.
because
what
we
have
here--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--the
reason
i
answered
your
question
the
way
in
which
i
did,
mr.
justice
powell,
is
this:
your
question
was
so
broad--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--that
it
picks
up
many
different
statements,
but
if
you're
asking
me
whether
or
not,
the
same
misrepresentation
of
his
date
and
place
of
birth
was
made
throughout
then
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
yes.
and
if
you're
asking
me
whether--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
those
statements
were
intentionally
made.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
i
think
that
willful
embodies
within
it
a
concept
of
mens
rea
or
a
black
heart
and
in
this
particular
instance
there's
no
black
heart
because
we
have--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--no.
what
he
did
is
he
made
a
misjudgment
and
the
misjudgment
that
he
made
was
that
in
a
procrustean
way
he
tried
to
conform
the
application
to
his
internal
lithuanian
passport
which
was
the
best
record
of
a
public
record
of
the
country
to
which
he
owed
allegiance
which
was
basically
the
test.
now,
the
so-called
other
documents
that
you're
talking
about,
none
of
them
were
public
records
and
doubtful
that
they
would
have
satisfied
a
requirement
to
obtain
the
particular
visa.
now
the
particular
instance
here,
however,
there's
a
certain
irony.
the
reason
why
he
had
the
misstated
date
and
place
of
birth
on
the
internal
lithuanian
passport
was
to
avoid
conscription
into
the
nazi
army
at
a
time
when
there
was
an
order
seeking
mobilization
of
the
lithuanians
under
the
most
dire
and
harshest
of
repressions
to
the
lithuanians.
point
of
fact
that
happened
four
days--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--pardon?
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes,
i'm
saying
why
it
wasn't--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--it
had
nothing
with
him
going
into
the
military.
it
had
the
reason
why--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--i'm
not
trying
to,
in
effect,
minimize
the
fact
that
he
lied.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
well,
your
honor,
that
i
would
take
severe
issue
with.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
individual
defended
himself
against
those
kind
of
charges
and
the
district
court
found
them
unreliable
and
inadmissable
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
if
we
had
the
most
heinous
crime
committed
in
the
united
states
of
a
similar
type
of
nature
no
court,
no
responsible
court
would
have
admitted
the
evidence
or
found
it
to
be
reliable
that
existed
in
this
particular
court.
so
i
would
take
very
serious
issue
with
that
as
to
how
this
gentleman
have
under
our
system
having
proved--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--no,
it
is
not
in
the
least
your
honor.
and
i
take
serious
issue
with
it,
but
what
it
does
raise
in
effect,
is
it
shows
how
the
tremendous
high
[inaudible]
pressure
of
the
nature
of
the
accusations
in
effect,
makes
it
very
difficult
to
deal
with
these
particular
issues
and
it
does
distort
judgment.
and
i
think
that
what
we
have
to
do
under
our
system
of
justice
in
order
for
it
to
work
and
work
effectively
is
we
have
to
see
whether
or
not
it's
capable
of
handling
cases
like
this
so
that
the
allegations
if
not
proved
don't
bear
upon
the
considerations
of
the
other
issues.
and
the
issues
here
are
whether
or
not
the
misstatement
as
to
his
date
and
place
of
birth
can
be
a
sufficient
grounds
for,
in
effect,
denaturalizing
him.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes.
you
have,
under
the--
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
--when
you
look
at
the
actual
document,
the
initial
registration,
he
did
the
same
thing
to
the
"german
authorities",
and
that
was
the
german
authorities
[inaudible].
now
it
is
true
on
a
different
and
subsequent
page
and
after
the
allied
occupation
it
does
contain
the
correct
date
and
place
of
birth.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
that's
correct.
after
the
allied
occupation.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
that
is
correct.
and
that
documentation
was
in
fact,
available
to
the
vice
counsel
because
of
the
fact
he
disclosed
each
one
of
those
residences
where
it
would
appear.
the
document
is
very
clear.
the
only
ambiguity
that
arises
from
it
is
the
fact
that
it
says
born
in
kaunas
but
has
to
taurage.
taurage
is
a
different
county
than
kaunas.
but
the
kaunas
place
of
birth
and
the
incorrect
date
of
birth
are,
in
effect,
in
the
initial
registration
document.
those
other
documents
you
see
are
reports
which
are
reflected
off
of
that
document,
but
it
is
not
until
after
the
allies
occupy
that
the
other
correct
information
is
reflected.
and
that's
a
faulty
review
again
of
the
third
circuit
which
was
picked
up
by
the
government,
but
it's
available
in
the
joint
appendix
for
the
examination
of
the
court.
it's
the
fold
out
document
that
we
have
in
there
and
i
have
in
it's
original
form
for
that
particular
reason.
i
see
that
i've
less
than
five
minutes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
additional
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
thank
you.
mr.
donald
j.
williamson
yes,
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
scalia,
page
53
of
the
joint
appendix
contains
the
initial
entry
records
under
the
so-called
third
reich.
the
translation
of
that
is
on
page
56
of
block
form
indicating
the
date
of
birth
which
is
the
same
on
the
internal
passport,
kaunas
which
is
the
same
as
the
internal
passport,
the
only
differential
is
terage,
which
is
a
county.
it's
a
misstatement
of
the
county.
so
i
accurately
stated
that
in
fact
he
did
give
the
same
misinformation
to
the
nazi
authorities.
insofar
as
the
statement
that
in
1948,
that
the
courts
in
connection
with
whether
or
not
to
justify
the
refusal
of
a
visa
or
the
exclusion
upon
entry
did
not
hold
for
materiality.
i
suggest
that
the
government
read
pages
25
and
26
of
our
brief.
the
second
circuit
in
iorio
v.
day,
a
1929
case
which
was
used
as
the
predicate
for
a
ruling
of
the
attorney
general
says,
it
is
true
that
the
realtor
was
bound
to
tell
the
truth
in
his
application.
if
what
he
suppressed
was
irrelevant
to
his
admission,
the
mere
suppression
would
not
debar
him.
but,
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
test
because
this
case
gives
an
excellent
illustration
as
to
why
the
tests
should
be
certitude
tests
to
be
consistent
with
schneiderman.
after
the
soviet
deposition
of
the
sister-in-law
was
taken,
she
indicated
that
she
was
unaware
that
her
sister
was
married.
based
upon
that
testimony,
the
government
amended
the
complaint
to
allege
that
he
misrepresented
the
fact
of
his
marriage.
now
it
is
possible
that
the
petitioner
was
not
married
in
lithuania.
it
is
also
possible
that
he
was
married
in
lithuania.
so
a
possibility
test
under
those
circumstances,
if
that
was
sufficient
to
rely
on
that
evidence
would
have
in
effect,
disqualified
this
individual
under
their
test,
the
so-called
identity,
marriage
being
a
factor
and
i
agree
with
you
when
it
didn't
change
his
name,
he
didn't
change
his
identity.
now,
as
to
probability
mrs.
kungys
testified
that
she
was
married
in
kaunas
on
august
24,
1943.
she
submits
as
part
of
the
ins
file
of
the
government,
her
internal
passport,
it
had
stamped
on
it
the
marriage
bureau
of
kaunas
with
a
number.
the
government
did
not
insist
before
they
amended
the
complaint
to
allege
a
misrepresentation
of
a
marriage
that
the
simple
fact
of
requiring
the
soviets
to
produce
the
marriage
register
of
that
date,
she
gave
them
the
date
and
the
number.
what
the
soviets
did
is
typical
of
their
subjugation
of
their
concept
of
justice
to
the
interests
of
the
state.
they
waited
until
after
the
date
that
the
case
was
scheduled
for
trial.
it
was
then
re-scheduled.
the
soviets,
seven
weeks
later
produced
the
marriage
register
of
kaunas,
same
number,
same
date
that
mrs.
kungys
said.
so,
in
effect,
what
you
have
here
is
when
you
require
a
certitude
test
on
the
government,
what
you
are
doing
is
saying
government
do
your
job.
conduct
an
effective
investigation
because
if
you
rely
upon
soviet
evidence,
which
is
unreliable,
you're
going
to
get
half
truths.
but
if
you
insist
upon
certitude
and
you
do
your
investigation
accurately--
