mr.
guminski,
while
you're
on
the
building,
this
was
in
a
garage,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
all
the
apartment
owners
have
a...
is
that
part
of
their...
what
they
rented,
the
rented
space
in
the
garage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
basically
the
garbage
was
still
on
their
premises?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
was
part
of
the
respondent's
premises.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
case
the
same
as
if
the
garbage
was
in
his
kitchen,
is
what
i'm
asking
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
about
the
garage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
garage
an
open
public
area?
justice
john
paul
stevens
accessible,
but
just
like
the
living
room...
just
like
leaving
the
door
unlocked,
or
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
record
makes
it
clear
that
people
who
do
not
live
or
are
not
guests
of
the
apartment
have
free
access
to
the
garage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
might
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
some
28-unit
buildings
that
have
a
common
area,
and
they're
very
careful
to
keep
the
garage
doors
locked,
because
they
don't
want
thieves
and
the
like
to
come
into
the
place,
even
though
the
garage
is
temporarily
in
that
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
he
have...
did
he
have
a
parking
space
in
the
garage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
case
do
you
rely
on
for
that
proposition?
xxx
garage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
issue
isn't
the
validity
of
the
warrant.
the
warrant
was
valid.
the
issue
is
the
validity
of
the
search
of
material
that
was
not
encompassed
by
the
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
puzzle
me
by
saying
we're
dealing
with
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit.
the
affidavit
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
took
place
before
the
affidavit
was
granted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
at
the
point,
supposing
this
were
a
private
home
with
an
attached
garage,
and
when
they
set
the
garage
out
to
be
picked
up
right
inside
the
alley,
but
it
was
still
within
the
garage,
but
the
garage
door
is
left
open.
could
the
police
search
the
can?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
an
apartment
dweller
who
handles
the
garbage
in
this
way
has
no
expectation
of
privacy.
if
it
were
upstairs
in
a
common
area
on
the
same
floor
where
sometimes
it
might
be
dumped,
but
not
on
his
apartment,
would
you
again
draw
the
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
it
has
to
be
in
an
area
with
respect
to
which
he
has
the
sole
right
of
possession;
if
it's
in
common
with
other
tenants,
it
doesn't
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
common
areas
of
a
multiple
unit
apartment
dwelling
don't
have
any
curtilage,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
question
in
the
multiple
unit
case
is
not
whether
one
tenant
has
privacy
rights
in
another
tenant's
private
area,
but
rather,
whether
any
of
them
have
a
privacy
right
in
a
common
area
from
which
the
public
is
excluded?
and
i
take
it
you
say
no,
they
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
this
garbage
had
been
left,
for
example,
in
the
front
hall
or
the
entrance
hall
of
a
large
building,
they
would
have...
they'd
lose
their
privacy
interests
the
same
way--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
on
the...
in
the
garbage
on
the
same
floor
they
lived
on.
as
soon
as
it
gets
out
of
their
exclusive
possession,
would
be
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
said
to
me,
in
a
home
and
a
garage,
they'd
be
protected
if
you
left
it
in
the
garbage
still
in
the
garage.
what
about
a
two-flat,
and
they
share
a
garage?
you'd
say
that's
a
common
area,
so
there's
no
protection
there?
that's
your
distinction,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
two-flat
isn't
enough,
what
about
three-flat,
and
as
soon
as
we
get
to
28,
have
we
crossed
the
constitutional
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
different
from
a
single
unit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
true
whether
it's
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that's
true
whether
it's
in
the
garage
or
on
the
curb,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
both
cases,
it
can
or
cannot
be
searched?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
both
cases,
it
can
or
cannot
be
searched?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which?
justice
john
paul
stevens
earlier
you
told
me
it
could
not
be
searched
if
it
is
in
the
garage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
we're
talking
now
about
a
single
home,
following
up
justice
blackmun's
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it's
in
the
garage,
it
cannot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
garage
door
is
open?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
base
that
on
a
different
intent
to
surrender
any
expectation
of
privacy
between
those
two
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
the
neighbor
picks
it
up
in
the
full
view
of
the
owner
who
had
thought
it
was
lost
and
saw
it?
to
whom
would
it
belong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
diamond
ring?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
abandoned,
as
a
matter
of
property
law,
the
neighbor
could
claim
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying,
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
it's
abandoned.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
i
understand
the
california
rule,
they
don't
require
a
warrant.
they
just
require
probable
cause,
and
then
they
can
make
a
warrantless
search
that
you
could
with
a
car.
