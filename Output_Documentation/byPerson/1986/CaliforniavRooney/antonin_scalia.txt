california
may
in
fact
have
a
higher
class
of
trash
than
other
states,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
had
a
whole
bunch
of
unrelated
persons
in
a
multiple
unit
dwelling
with
many
bedrooms,
let's
say
a
dormitory
with
a
bunch
of
college
students
in
it,
you
wouldn't
say
that
one
college
student
has
a
fourth
amendment
right
with
respect
to
the
bedroom
of
another
college
student,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
multiple
unit
thing
is
quite
a
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
because
people
all
live
together
doesn't
mean
that
each
one
of
them
has
a
right
of
privacy
in
the
entire
area
that
they're
living
together
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
case
involves
curtilage
and
the
other
case
doesn't
involve
curtilage;
that's
the
difference
between
the
two,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
prosecute
somebody
who
picked
up
the
diamond
ring
in
the
trash
in
collecting
the
garbage,
or
an
apple
core,
for
that
matter,
for
larceny?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
opposed
to
subterranean
communal
garages
which
are
the
site
of
intimate
activities?
3--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
and
you
would
assert
that
even
trash
out
on
a
curb
would
retain
the
right
of
privacy?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
not
relying
on
the
curtilage...
on
the
curtilage
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
whether
it
was
horizontal
or
vertical
distance,
did
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
might
be
in
good
shape
if
we
just
meant
horizontal
distance.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
so
extraordinary?
i'll
tell
you
something
that
makes
it
even
worse
than
that.
you
have
people
who
have
fourth
amendment
garbage
collectors
and
people
who
don't
have
fourth
amendment
garbage
collectors.
because
some
places
we've
lived,
they
would
come
into
your
yard,
and
open
the
gate,
and
take
out
your
trash
from
inside
your
yard.
and
you
could
leave
it
fenced
in
until
they
came
and
collected
it.
other,
more
surly
garbage
collectors
will
not
do
that,
and
you
have
to
leave
it
out
at
the
curb.
you
cannot
leave
it
within
your
curtilage.
now,
is
there
some
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law,
because
you
have
different,
you
know,
garbage
collectors
of
varying
amounts
of
goodwill.
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
that
this...
what
was
it?
8
by
5
by
4--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
this
isn't
put
out
on
the
curb
for
collection,
right?
i
mean
i
assume
that
the
garbage
truck
is
one
of
those
trucks
that
drives
inside
and
lifts
it
up
and
it
dumps
into
the
truck
automatically?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
somehow
doubt
that
the
size
of
this
container
would
allow
it
to
be
carried
outside
the
garage,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
has
everything
in
it.
there's
no
element
of
fourth
amendment
law
that
isn't
here.
we're
into
the
automobile
exception
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
don't
follow
your
argument.
your
assumption
seems
to
be
that
the
principle
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
somehow
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
keep
things
secret
if
you
want
to.
and
i
don't
see
that
as
a
principle
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment
is
just
that
there
are
certain
areas
of
your
life
which
are
private.
now
it
may
well
be
that
there
are
no
ways
to
keep
some
things
secret,
like
the
disposal
of
a
dead
body.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
fourth
amendment
isn't
working,
simply
because
there
is
no
way
you
could
dispose
of
it
that
the
police
wouldn't
find
it.
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
point
here
was,
gee,
there
ought
to
be
some
way
to
get
rid
of
these
things
that
the
police
wouldn't
find
it.
that's
not
the
principle
of
the
fourth
amendment
at
all.
what
do
you
do...
speaking
of
curtilage,
what
do
you
do
about
the
fenced
in
area
around
the
apartment
house?
i
assume
if
you
think
the
subterranean
garage
is
part
of
the
curtilage,
you
would
also
say
that
the
grounds
around
this
28-unit
apartment
house
that
were
surrounded
by
a
fence,
that
is
also
curtilage?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what's
the
difference
between
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
intimate
activities
of
life
go
on
in
the
garage?
justice
antonin
scalia
every
nonapartment
dweller
has
the
same
problem,
and
what
we
do
is,
we
keep
it
in
our
house
and
put
it
out
once
a
week,
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
inhabitant
of
apartment
28
whom
your
client
doesn't
know
at
all
is
down
there
in
the
garage,
and
he
seeks
this
big
crate
of
garbage
over
there,
and
he
rummages
around
in
it,
and
he
picks
up
something
that
your
client
had
thrown
away
down
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
would
mr.
rooney
be
able
to
get
it
back,
do
you
think,
if
he
hadn't...
it's
not
a
diamond
ring
that
was
thrown
away
by
mistake;
it's
a
piece
of
trash.
and
rooney
says,
you
know,
i'm
sorry
for
throwing
that
out,
i
want
it
back.
so
he
goes
up
to
apartment
28
and
he
demands
it
back.
do
you
think
he'd
be
entitled
to
get
it
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
talking
about
whether
it's
realistically
been
abandoned
when
it's
been
put
down
there,
and
whether
that
place
is
a
place
in
which
he
thinks
he
really
has
privacy
in
what
he
has
deposited
in
the
garbage
bin.
it
seems
to
me,
he
doesn't.
it
seems
to
me
he
knows
that
anyone
of
the
inhabitants
of
any
of
the
other
27
apartments
can
go
down
there
and
take
out
of
that
trash
bin
whatever
they
want
to
take
out
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
feel
the
same
way
about
the
trash
on
the
sidewalk,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
if
my
neighbor
comes
around
and
takes
something
out
of
the
trash
can
that
i've
laid
down
on
the
sidewalk,
i
can
come
up
to
him
and
say,
hey,
give
that
back
to
me,
that's
my
trash.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
could
prosecute
them
for
theft
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't...
that
doesn't...
that
indicates
a
desire
for
secrecy.
but
he
does
that
when
he
creeps
out
into
the
park
at
night
and
tries
to
hide
it
under
a
bush
in
the
park.
and
a
policeman
can
surely
come
around
and
take
it
from
under
the
bush.
the
mere
fact
that
he
wants
to
keep
it
secret
is
not
equivalent
with
a
fourth
amendment
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
has
the
fellow
who
hides
it
under
the
bush
in
the
park?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
hides
it
under
a
bench
on
a
cement
street.
i
mean,
you
know,
fields
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you're
mixing
up
your
two
arguments
now.
the
curtilage
argument
is
quite
separate.
i
mean,
we
were...
we
were
just
talking
about
your
general
privacy
in
garbage
argument,
which
is
different
from
your
curtilage
argument?
