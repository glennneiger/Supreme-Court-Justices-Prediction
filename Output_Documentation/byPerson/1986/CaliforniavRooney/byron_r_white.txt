well,
did
you...
did
you
want
to
introduce...
there's
never
been
a
trial,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
you
want
to
introduce
anything
you
got
out
of
the
trash
bag--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
just
what
you
found
in
the
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the...
the
court
of
appeal...
the
court
of
appeal
said
that
the
warrant
was
valid
based
on
other
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
everything
you
found
under
the
search
warrant
is
admissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
you're
really
going
to
use
that
at
this
trial,
or
you
think
that
you
would
really
need
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
the
court
of
appeal
here
mean
by
saying
that
this
area
was
accessible
to
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
ordinarily,
the
fact
that
a
trash
bin
was
located
in
an
area
accessible
to
the
public.
the
ordinary...
that
would
just...
you
would
think
that
a
member
of
the
public
going
on
there,
going
in
that
area,
would
not
be
trespassing.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
doesn't
sound
like
the
courts
below
even
relied
on
the
curtilage
notion.
it
did...
it
would
have
said,
visible,
if
it
meant
what
you
said.
it
didn't
say
"visible".
it

justice
byron

let's
assume
he
owns
it
and
he
could
get
it
back.
but
could
he...
say
he
notices
a
neighbor,
comes
around
and
runs
through
his
trash
every
week,
and
is
reading
pieces
of
paper.
could
he
have
him
stopped
when
the
garbage
pail
is
out
on
the
curb
in
a
public
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
far
do
you
go?
suppose
it
gets
on
the
garbage
truck,
and
all
of
a
sudden,
there
is
a
policeman
pouring
through
that...
the
top
layer
of
garbage
or
trash
that's
just
been
put
on
the
truck?
as
soon
as
the
trashman
takes
it,
is
his
privacy
interest
gone?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can
follow
it
right
to
the
dump?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
really
have
to
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
your
theory
just
has
to
take
you
that
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
really,
the
question
is,
do
you
think...
do
you
think
that
any
person
can
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
papers
that
the
trashman
picks
up
out
of
his
trash
can
and
dumps
in
his
truck?
and
if
you
think
he
is
reasonable,
you
think
the
public
is
really
of
a
mind
to
respect
his
right
of
privacy
to
a
bunch
of
trash
that's
now
in
a
trash
truck,
a
garbage
truck?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
just
so
happens,
that
the
trashman
is
a
government
employee.
