we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-1835,
california
against
peter
rooney.
mr.
guminski,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
anyone
dispute
at
this
hearing
that
it
was
a
communal
trash
bin?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
guminski.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lewis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
trash
bin
was
located
in
the
apartment's
garage,
which
was
an
area
accessible
to
the
public.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
when
you
say
it's
a
house,
you
certainly
don't
mean
it
had
the
sort
of
privacy
interests
that
you'd
get
inside
the
four
walls
of
a
house?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
had
been
at
the
top,
we'd
have
a
different
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
some
of
these
things
that
are
not
in
the
record
like
whether
the
garbage
truck
came
in
or
the
container
went
out
or
whether
the
garage
door
was
up
or
down
made
no
difference?
that
it
recited
in
its
opinion
the
facts
that
it
thought
were
controlling,
and
the
facts
it
didn't
recite
would
not
have
affected
its
determination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lewis,
supposing
that
this
28-apartment
building
had
all
been
inhabited
by
a
rather
wealthy
person
and
his
staff
of
servants,
this
clearly
would
be
within
the
curtilage
in
that
sense.
but
do
you
think,
nonetheless,
inhabited
by
28
different
people
or
different
families,
that
when
they
have
a
communal
area,
that
there
isn't
a
point
where
the
numbers
mean
you've
lost
privacy,
even
though
it
is
not
open
to
the
public,
or
even
though
it's
within
the
curtilage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
take
that
kind
of
trash
that
you
don't
want
people
to...
and
bury
it
over
in
the
park.
and
that
doesn't
mean
that
you're
free
from
having
the
police
look
over
in
the
park.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
meant
to
say
what
you
say
it
meant
to
have
said,
it
would
have
said
that
this
was
visible
to
the
public.
but
they
went
much
further.
they
said
it
was
accessible
to
the
public.
that
doesn't
suggest
just
seeing.
it
suggests
physically
touching.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lewis.
the
case
is
submitted.
