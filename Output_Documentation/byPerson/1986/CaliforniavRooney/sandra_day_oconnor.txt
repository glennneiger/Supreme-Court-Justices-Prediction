mr.

is
it
true
that
under
california
law
as
articulated
in
the
krivda
case,
that
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
abandoned
garbage
in
california?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
indications
are
that
california
would
recognize
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy?

i'm
curious
how
that
interfaces
then
with
the
inquiry
we
would
make
under
the
fourth
amendment
about
whether
a
particular
expectation
of
privacy
is
reasonable.
do
we...
do
we
have
to
look
at
all
at
california
law?
or
do
we
ignore
that
and
make
it
purely
a
federal
inquiry--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
what's
a
reasonable
expectation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
if
it's
a
coop?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
they
owned
the
common
area?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
you
can
have
multiple
owners
of
an
individual
dwelling
as
well.
you
wouldn't
say
that
diminishes
the
expectation
of
privacy
of
the
resident,
would
you?
