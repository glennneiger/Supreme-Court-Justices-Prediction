unclear
in
the
record
in
this
case.
what
is

justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
basement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
basement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
need
subterranean?
who
owned
this
trash
receptacle?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
you
have
found
out?
couldn't
the
police
department
have
found
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
let
us
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
to
extend
the
open
fields
doctrine
to
a
basement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
say
how
many
apartments
are
in
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
apartments
are
in
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
say
a
thing
about
what
was
in
that
building.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
apartments
are
in
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
by
the
time
of
trial,
did
you
say...
is
there
anything
in
the
trial--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--was
it
in
the
trial
record,
or
was
it
in
the
magistrate's
record?

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
not
testimony.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
entrance
to
the
garage?
i'm
just
talking
about
the
things
that
should
be
in
the
record
that
are
not
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
all
i
know,
the
record
was
closed
to
the
public.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
if.
i
said
it
could
be.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you've
been
could-being
for
the
last
10
minutes.
we
can't
decide
cases
on
could
be.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this...
where
is
it?
is
it
near
the
front
door
or
the
back
door
or
what?
did
he
have
a
car?
you
don't
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
know
now
and
you
don't
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
locked
or
unlocked?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
it
was
locked
or
not,
the
question
of
whether
it
was
locked,
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
he
had
an
expectation
of
privacy;
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
isn't
the
whole
record
built
on
what
is
likely
or
not?
my
query
is,
we
are
deciding
a
constitutional
issue
on
facts
that
you
had
a
chance
to
put
evidence
in
and
didn't.
and
there
was
no
problem
in
doing
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
to
infer
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
have
put
on
any
testimony
that
was
relevant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
you
have
objected?
couldn't
you
objected
by
saying
that
this
is
a
communal
place,
and
put
on
evidence
to
that
effect?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
you
have
put
the
evidence
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let's
do
that
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
do
that
right
here.
what
is
there
in
this
record
to
show
this
man's
relationship
to
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
it
show?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
it
show
positively?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
it
show
who
used
the
garbage
can?
how
many
people
used
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
whole
point
originally
was,
all
these
things
you
talk
about
are
not
in
this
record.
well,
if
he
weren't
a
tenant,
i
suppose
his
fourth
amendment
claim
would
be
nonexistent,
if
he's
simply
a
stranger
to
the
building.
and
saying
he's
a
tenant
is
putting
him
in
the
most
favorable
spot
you
would
permit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
nobody's
doing
him
any
favors.
was
the
judgment
below
in
your
favor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
xxx
inside
of
a
house
is
not
outside
of
the
curtilage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
don't
you
say
that
inside
a
house
is
not,
quote,
an
open
field,
end
quote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
are
you
getting
all
these
other
problems?
justice
thurgood
marshall
xxx
open
fields,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
trash
was
inside
a
house.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
don't
you
stick
to
that?
