mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
california
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
appellate
district.
it
involves
the
following
salient
facts.
on
december
15th,
1983,
los
angeles
police
officers
shorb
and
wyeth,
suspecting
that
rooney
was
conducting
bookmaking
operations
at
his
west
hollywood
apartment,
went
to
the
apartment
building
in
question.
they
entered
the
subterranean
garage
of
that
apartment
building
and
approached
a
communal
metal
trash
can
for
the
apartment
building,
which
was
8
feet
long,
5
feet
tall,
and
4
feet
wide.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
it
would
be
underneath
the
apartments
themselves.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
pardon
me?
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
basement,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
i
do
not
know
who
is
the
specific
owner
of
the
trash
receptacle.
it
was
not
expressly
disclosed
in
the
record.
however--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--it
is
possible
that
they
could
have
found
out,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
it
does
not...
that
fact
is
not
disclosed
in
the
record.
i
should
like
to
point
out,
however,
that
the
question
as
to
who
technically
was
the
owner
of
this
apartment
building
and
the
garage,
as
we
shall
see,
is
not
really
a
critical
issue,
if
i
may
continue.
the
officers
went
to
the
trash
bin
and
proceeded
to
search
it...
i
use
the
term
in
its
popular
sense.
and
halfway
down
they
located
a
brown
paper
shopping
bag
which
they
removed.
it
contain
mail
addressed
to
mr.
rooney
and
evidences
of
bookmaking
operations.
the
question
posed
is
whether
mr.
rooney's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
by
this
examination
of
the
contents
of
this
trash
bag.
our
position
is
that
it
was
not,
and
for
two
different
grounds.
the
first
ground
is
that
mr.
rooney
had
abandoned
the
trash
when
it
was
placed
in
the
communal
trash
bin
of
this
apartment
building.
that
is,
that
trash
ceased
to
be
his
or
anyone's
papers
and
effects
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
it
was
deposited
in
the
trash
bin.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
yes,
justice.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
i
think
that
it
can
be
stated,
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
cannot
say
that
that
is
an
absolute
statement
because
the
california
supreme
court
has
not
ruled
on
a
situation
such
as
that
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
was
the
holding
in
the
instant
case
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
we
submit--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--justice
o'connor,
we
submit
that
this
court
must
use
a
federal,
national
standard.
the
question
is
whether
an
expectation
of
privacy
is
such
that
society
is
prepared
to
recognize
it
as
reasonable,
and
the
society
in
question
is
the
nation
as
a
whole.
if
this
court
were
to
determine
the
question
of
reasonableness
by
a
particular
state,
one
may
not
be
speaking
of
the
identical
standard,
because
the
state
in
question
might
impose
a
much
higher
standard
than
that
required
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
yes,
your
honor.
it
apparently
is
valued
that
when
garbage
is
put
in
it
somehow
emerges
when
taken
out
by
a
police
officer
with
an
aura
of
respectability.
and
the
two
grounds
that
we
have
just
stated
are
such
that
the
second
ground,
that
is,
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
ground,
is
inferior
or
subordinate
to
the
first
ground.
because
there
can
be
no
fourth
amendment
rooted
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
items
which
have
ceased
to
be
papers
and
effects
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
court,
in
oliver
v.
united
states,
confirmed
the
ruling
in
hester
than
open
fields
are
note
embraced
by
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
one
independent
ground
was
that
this
was
precluded
by
the
explicit
language
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
this
court
proceeded
to
note
that
katz'
standard
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
standard--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--we
are
not
speaking
that
it...
the
open
fields
doctrine
extends
to
the
basement,
sir.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
we
are
saying
that
a
basement,
in
the
first
place,
is
not
within
the
curtilage
or
the
house
of
mr.
peter
rooney.
that
is
clear
from...
pardon
me?
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
well,
because
the
record
describes
this
apartment
building
as--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--how
many...?
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
it--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--it
described
mr.
rooney
as
being
in
apartment
number
eight,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
the
affidavit
and
the
search
warrant
itself
did
not
state
the
precise
number
of
apartments
in
the
building.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
in
the
record
it
was
stated
before
the
magistrate
that
there
were
28
units
in
the
building.
this
was
not
challenged
in
the
court
below.
the
court
of
appeal,
in
its
opinion,
in
its
published
opinion--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--it
is
in
the
record
on
appeal.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
well,
if
i...
if
your
honor--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--thank
you,
justice
marshall.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
it
was
mentioned
that
there
were
28
units
by
the
prosecutor.
this
was
not
challenged
by
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
there
was
a
representation
by--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--it
is
not,
your
honor.
but
it
was
a
representation
made
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
it
was
not
challenged.
it
was
stated
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
without
objection
by
respondent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
respondent's
brief
the
apartment
building
is
described
as
a
28-unit
apartment
building.
but
certainly,
the--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
this
could
be
inferred,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
the
garbage...
the
trash
bin
was
located
within
the
subterranean
garage.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
it
was
part--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--no,
your
honor,
it
is
not,
because
clearly,
if
a
trash
container
was
in
a
kitchen
of
a
person,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
per
se
interest
in
trash,
that
would
be
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
far
as
the
interest
in
one's
house
would
extend
to
one's
kitchen--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--and
would
extend
to
the
trash
container.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
this
would
be
an
area
open
to
the...
accessible
to
the
public.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
i
infer
from...
i
infer
that
it
being
an
open
garage
that
it
is
common
to
all
the
apartment
dwellers,
as
well
as
other
people
who
might
come
in
through
the
opening.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
it
does
not
expressly
state
so.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
it
might,
i
do
not
think
it
could
make--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--your
honor,
it
might
become
relevant,
although
it
is
hard
to
see
offhand,
with
respect
to
someone
else's
interest,
if
there
were
some
other
person
other
than
peter
rooney
who
was
involved.
but
he
was
a
tenant
in
this
building.
it
was
not
part
of
his
house
or--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--that
can
be
inferred
that
he
did.
i
do
not
know
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but
it
can
be
inferred
he
had
only
a
right
of
access
to
this
garage.
that
does
not
make
it
part
of
the
curtilage
of
his
home,
within
the
meaning
of
the
curtilage
as
defined
by
this
court,
as
recently
as
united
states
versus--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
your
honor--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--if
it
was
closed
to
the
public--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--it
could
be
closed
to--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--justice--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--this
is
not
disclosed
in
the
affidavit
which
was
presented
to
the
magistrate's--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--however,
i
would
submit--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--it
does
not
expressly
state
so.
it
was
described
by
the
court
of
appeal
as
being
accessible
to
the
public.
i
would
submit,
justice
marshall,
that
this
factor
is
not
controlling,
because
the
question
is
whether
mr.
rooney's
fourth
amendment
interests
were
not
violated.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
i
say...
well,
there
certainly...
we
would
submit
it
would
not
be,
because
he
has
no...
would
have
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
as
far
as
a
common
garage
of
an
apartment
building,
whether...
within...
that
would
be
rooted
in
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
that
would
suggest
that
to
me,
justice
powell.
but
one
has
to...
this
case
really
turns
on
the
question
of
a
document
presented
to
the
magistrate
pursuant
to
a
request
for
a
search
warrant.
and
one
must
presume
that
the
magistrate
made
inferences
favorable
to
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
which
he
did
issue.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
no,
your
honor.
no
one
has
challenged,
and
it
is
so
described
in
respondent's
brief.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
yes.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
that
would
be
most
likely,
your
honor,
unless
he
generated
a
lot
of
trash,
which
is
unlikely.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
your
honor,
the
case
arose--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--justice
marshall,
the
case
arose
on
a
motion
to
quash
a
warrant
on
the
ground
that
the
legal
insufficiency
of
the
affidavit
on
its
face--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--one
could
not
put
on
relevant
testimony
at
a
suppression
hearing
if
the
court
had
denied...
had
granted
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
well,
the
issue
before
the
trial
court
was
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--i
do
not
see
how
procedurally
it
could
have
been
possible
because--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--there
has
been
no
dispute
at
any
hearing
in
the
courts
below,
including
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
that
is
correct.
we
petition
this
court
for
certiorari
because
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
that
the
communal
trash
bin
search
was
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment
was
something
which
we
felt
was
erroneous,
and
it
was
a
final
order
for
purposes
of
seeking
review
in
this
court
because...
for
evident
reasons.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
again,
because
we
are
dealing
with
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
on
its
face,
which
was
the
only
thing
presented--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--it
does
not
appear
expressly
ain
the
record,
no.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
well,
i
correct
myself.
the
only
information--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--the
only
evidentiary
matter
is
that
which
is
contained
in
the
affidavit,
that
is
correcct,
your
honor.
the...
the
position
in
oliver
was
that
the
fourth
amendment
itself,
by
its
explicit
language,
delimited
the
scope
of
its
protection.
and
as...
and
this
is
clearly
justified
by
the
language
of
the
first
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment,
which
does
not
say
simply
that
the
right
of
the
people
be
secure
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated;
it
provides
that
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects,
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated.
this
court
technically
defines
a
search
as
being
an
infringement
of
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
if
one
were
to
make
a
substitutional
definition
of
the
term
"search"
and
put
it
in
the
text
of
the
first
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
would
then
read:
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects
against
unreasonable
infringements
of
their
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
and
unreasonable
searches
shall
not
be
violated.
i
think
this
highlights
that
the
fourth
amendment
itself
distinguishes
between
two
classes
of
entities.
the
first
class
of
entities
is
what
kind
of
entity...
what
kinds
of
entities
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that
is
the
houses...
the
persons,
the
houses,
the
papers
and
effects
of
the
people.
and
the
second
class
of
entities
are,
what
are
those
kind
of
activities
which
are
being
prohibited
by
the
fourth
amendment,
and
those
are
infringements
of
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
aforementioned
interests.
so
the
question
ultimately
comes
down
to
what
kind
of
interests
of
rooney
were
violated
such
as
that
he
can
urge
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
instant
case.
now,
surely
his
person
is
not
involved.
there
is
no
violation
of
his
fourth
amendment
interest
in
his
person
as
such.
the
next
classification
is
that
of
his
house.
and
again,
taking
words
as
they
appear,
we
submit
that
the
underground
garage
of
the
apartment
building
to
which
he
and
presumably
other
tenants
had
access
was
not
part
of
his
house
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
nor
part--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--this
would
be
within
the
curtilage.
no,
sir,
presumptively
not,
because
it
would
be
within
the
curtilage
of
an
individual
home
dweller.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
he
would
not
have
a
fourth
amendment
interest
violated,
according
to
our--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--or
it
can
meaningfully
be
said
to
be
his
curtilage.
and
we
submit
that
the
common
underground--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--are
not...
does
not
itself
constitute
a
curtilage
of
any
particular
tenant.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
here...
we
would
submit
that
it
does
not,
either,
your
honor,
although
there
may
be
title--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--yes,
but
a
person
may
have
title
and
share
with
many
in
access
to
a
particular
common
area,
but
the
question
would
be
whether
it
would
be
in
a
meaningful
sense,
his
house
and
his
curtilage.
and
you
could
have
a
coop
with
many,
many
residents,
albeit
all
legal
owners
in
general
having
common
use
of
a
common
area.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
well,
of
course,
one
is
always,
justice
o'connor,
coming
to
close
questions
of
where
one
draws
the
line.
and
it
may
well
come
to
a
point
where
one
will
say
that
there
may
be
multiple
residents
of
a
single
dwelling
yet
to
be
considered
a
single
dwelling
residence,
where,
yes,
a
number
of
persons,
such
as
members
of
one
family,
could
be...
would
have
one
curtilage--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
a
multiple
unit
is
a
different
situation.
i
was
just
trying
to
accommodate--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--no,
it
does
not.
no,
it
does
not.
i
was
just
trying
to
acknowledge
to
justice
o'connor
that
one
does
come
to
closer
cases
where
decision
making
becomes
more
critical,
but
we
do
have
this
in
this--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--well,
we
are
saying
that
they
do
not
have
a
fourth
amendment
interest.
it
is
not
a
part
of
their
house
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
they
may
have
interests
in
containers
or
cars
or
effects,
their
effects,
in
that
common
area.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
i
would
submit
on
that
analysis,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
yes,
but
if
it
is
a
common
container,
container
open
to
the
use
of...
of
everybody,
there
is
no
fourth
amendment
interest.
if
a
person,
however,
may
have
his
own
container
in
a
garage,
garages
frequently

apartment
garages
frequently

containers,

containers.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
that
is
an
extremely,
extremely
close
case,
where
i
would
say
that
one
would
be--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--i
would
say
that
one
would
feel
compelled
to
say
that
when
you
have
a
two-unit--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--that's
different
from
single,
but
there
may
be...
there
may
be
a
greater
scope
to
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
we
are
distinguishing
between
two
issues,
justice
stevens.
before
you
can
discuss
whether
a
person
has
a
reasonable
expectation
as
to
a
house,
you
might
say,
you
have
to
decide
whether
it's
his
house
in
a
meaningful
sense.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
pardon
me?
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
it
does
not
show...
one
can
infer
that
he
is
a
tenant.
he
is
described
as
being
in
apartment
eight.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
he
is...
it
indicates
that
he
is
a
tenant.
he
is
indicated
as
being
in
apartment
eight.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
it
does
not
show
expressly
whether
he
is
or
is
not
a--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--it
does
not
expressly
show
how
many
people
used
it.
however,
as
justice
powell
points
out--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
the
judgment
below
sustained
the
search
warrant
on
the
ground
that
the
affidavit
had
sufficient--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--no,
there
has
not
been
a
trial.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
the--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--there
would
be
an
intention,
if
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeal
were
overturned,
to
introduce
evidence
pertaining
to
what
was
found
in
the
trash
bag.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
that
matter
in
the
affidavit--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
ruling
as
far
as
the...
by
the
court
of
appeal
is
a
ruling
which
forecloses
the
use
of
what
was
discovered
as
far
as
the
trash
bag;
that
would
be
the
rule
of
the
case.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
we
really
want
would
be
to
hope
to
tend
to
overrule
people
v.
krivda,
which
was
here
before
this
court
in
1972,
and
which
was
remanded
then
because
there
were
independent
state
grounds.
i
mean,
i
wish
to
answer
candidly
to
your
question,
justice;
there
is
an
intention
to
use
it,
of
course.
but
it
is
a
vehicle
of
review.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
according
to
our
analysis,
that
when
a
person
sets
out
a
trash
can,
albeit
that
trash
can
is
his
effect,
when
he
sets
it
out
for
collection,
he
is
manifesting
an
unequivocal,
unconditional
intent
to
part
with
this
trash
forever.
he
is
expressing
a
judgment
that
it
no
longer
has
any
value
for
him,
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
it
has
ceased
to
be
his
papers
and
effects
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
he
no
longer
manifests
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
it
makes
no
difference,
that's
correct.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
pardon
me?
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
well,
you
are
saying
it--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--no,
i
am
saying
this,
justice
stevens.
if,
in
either
case,
if
somebody
places
trash
in
a
communal
trash
bin
of
a--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--if
somebody
places
a
trash
bit
out
for
collection,
it
can
be
searched.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
if
it's
in
his
garage,
it
cannot.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
even
though
it
is
open--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--the
point
is
that
the
right
of
ownership
to
one's
house
and
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
house
encompasses
his
garage.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
there
is
no
abandonment
of
title.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
but
we
are
dealing
with
trash.
and
the
trash...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fathers...
the
founders
of
the
constitution
and
the
bill
of
rights
would
have
applauded
katz
v.
united
states
in
considering
that
electronic
surveillance,
which
was
not
anticipated
by
them
would
be
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment,
but
that
they
would
be
somewhat
scandalized
to
think
that
trash
set
out
for
collection
or
in
the
place
of
a
communal
trash
bin
remained--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--there
was...
he
abandoned...
yes,
he
abandoned
his--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--well,
in
terms
of
title,
i
suppose,
no.
but
this
is
a...
this
is
a--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--he
would
certainly
go
to
retrieve,
that
is
true,
once
he
became
aware.
but
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
he
is
manifesting
then
and
there
and
unconditional,
unequivocal
intent
to
part
with
the
trash.
and
i'm
sure
that
the
founders
of
the
constitution
would
not
think
that
these
were
among
the
papers
and
effects
as
to
which
there
could
be
a
reasonable
expectation--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--personal
property,
as
far
as
lost
or
misplaced
property.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
well,
there
are
two
different
concepts.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
one
is
mere
property
law,
and
the
other--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--is
what
is
abandonment
for
fourth
amendment
purposes.
