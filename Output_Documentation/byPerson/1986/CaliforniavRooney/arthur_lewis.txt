mr.
arthur
lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
a
statement
from
this
court
only
a
few
weeks
again
in
arizona
versus
hicks.
there's
nothing
new
in
the
realization
that
the
constitution
sometimes
insulates
the
criminality
of
a
few
of
us
in
order
to
protect
the
privacy
of
us
all.
this
case
here
is
a
search
without
a
warrant
where
police
intended
to
seize
the
property
of
the
defendant.
a
warrant
is
required,
except
in
certain
well
delineated
cases
such
as
automobile
exceptions.
we
talk
in
terms
here
not
of
abandonment.
we
have
a
curtilage
problem.
one
of
the
things
we
have
to
rely
on
in
this
particular
matter
is
not
only
oliver
but
even
what
this
court
said
in
dunn.
we
find
no
problem
with
what
this
court
has
said.
if
i
might
quote
from
oliver,
where
the
court
said:
the
rule
of
hester
that
we
reaffirm
in
oliver
today
may
be
understood
as
providing
that
an
individual
may
not
legitimately
demand
privacy
for
activities
conducted
out
of
doors
in
fields,
except
in
the
area
immediately
surrounding
the
home.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
open
fields
do
not
provide
the
setting
for
those
intimate
activities
intended
to
be
sheltered
from
governmental
interference.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
since
open
fields
can
be
viewed
by
the
public
to
see
growing
crops,
in
this
case
marijuana,
fences
or
no
trespassing
signs
do
not
generally
bar
the
public
from
seeing
or
viewing
these
open
fields.
now,
we
can
live
with
this--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--correct.
because
one
of
the
intimate
activities
that
we
deal
with
in
our
everyday
life
in
our
homes
is
the
accumulation
of
trash.
you've
got
to
do
something
with
your
trash.
you
must
dispose
of
it.
as
his
honor
just
indicated,
we
put
it
out
on
a
curb.
mr.
arthur
lewis
yes,
there
is--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--i
do,
from
this
standpoint.
when
we
go
from
oliver
to
dunn,
we
find
what
this
court
has
indicated
would
be
helpful.
the
court
didn't
say
it
was
a
talisman.
it's
not
a
litmus
test.
but
the
court
did
point
out
in
dunn
what
would
be
helpful
in
determining
what
does
or
does
not
constitute
the
curtilage.
there
were
four
items
mentioned.
and
i
submit
one
is,
the
proximity
of
the
area
claimed
to
the
home.
now,
in
dunn,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
50
or
60
yards
was
too
far
away.
there
were
fences
around
it,
barbed
wire.
in
oliver
we
had
no
trespassing
signs.
mr.
arthur
lewis
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
lewis
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
petitioners
in
their
opening
brief
pointed
out
that
mr.
rooney
lived
in
the
northwest
apartment,
and
it
was
the
southeast
end
of
the
building
where
the
trash
was.
what
this
confronts
me
with
is
the
fact
that
we're
now
going
to
have
first
amendment
apartments
and
those
without
first
amendment
rights,
and
first
amendment
rights
may
rent
for
$100
a
month
more
if
they're
closer
to
the
trash.
mr.
arthur
lewis
there
is
for
one
reason.
i
find
one
reason
for
that,
your
honor.
because
if
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
it
is
people
and
not
places.
that's
where
we're
drawing
this
distinction.
that's
why
we're
here.
that's
why
we
have
this
particlar
problem.
mr.
arthur
lewis
well,
i
would
submit--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--i
do
say.
inside
a
house
is
not
an
open
field.
mr.
arthur
lewis
trash
outside
is
still
not
an
open
field,
if
it's
not
in
my
backyard.
if
it's
under--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--trash
inside
his
house
is
not
an
open
field.
mr.
arthur
lewis
it
is
our
position
that
the
subterranean--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--well,
i
do
now.
i
submit
we
go
even
further.
mr.
arthur
lewis
correct.
mr.
arthur
lewis
i
do
make
this
distinction,
your
honor.
there's
a
distinction
between
being
open
to
the
public
and
accessible
to
the
public.
now,
in
dunn
and
oliver,
the
officers
were
able
to
go
onto
the
fields
and
see
the
contraband.
in
our
particular
instance,
with
all
due
deference
to
counsel,
they
were
precluded
from
introducing
evidence.
but
if
we
take
it
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
them,
we
have
an
apartment
dwelling
in
an
urban
area
which,
while
the
record
doesn't
show
was
fenced
as
in
dunn,
the
court
pointed
out
fencing
wouldn't
actually
have
to
be
required.
you
have
a
situation
where
perhaps
even
the
garage
door
is
not
gated
shut.
all
you
can
have
is
people
walking
by
and
seeing
this
large
trash
bin.
what
distinguishes
rooney
and
what
gives
him
his
right
of
privacy
and
the
expectation
thereof,
is
the
fact
that
he
saw
to
it,
however
it
was
done,
that
it
be
at
the
bottom.
obviously,
if
it's
on
the
top--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--clearly,
if
it
was
on
the
top
exposed
to
view,
then
perhaps,
under
the
auto
exceptions,
where
an
officer
might
be
deemed
to
have
a
right
to
go
in
and
look
at
a
vehicle,
for
whatever
reason.
but
one
thing
we
haven't
spoken
of
here
is
that
this
was
a
case
where
there
was
an
anonymous
phone
call,
and
the
first
investigation
that
was
done,
other
than
to
check
mr.
rooney's
name
and
find
out
that
some
years
before
he
had
been
arrested
for
this
activity,
was
to
search
his
trash.
now,
i
submit,
that
is
not
what
we
are
looking
for
in
effective
law
enforcement.
mr.
arthur
lewis
five
feet
high?
mr.
arthur
lewis
there
was
not
testimony
to
indicate
whether
the
maintenance
people
had
to
take
that
large
trash
truck
and
put
it
outside
for
the
garbage
man,
or
whether
the
truck
came
in.
i
somehow
doubt
that
the
size
of
these
garbage
trucks
would
permit
them
to
be
driven
into
the
subterranean
garage.
mr.
arthur
lewis
if
the
container
couldn't
be
carried
outside
the
garage,
i
think
certainly
a
truck
couldn't
come
in.
mr.
arthur
lewis
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
because
what
the
court
did
was
to
point
out
that
the
people
hadn't
established
that
the
property
was
abandoned.
that
was
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
that
the
people
had
failed
to
establish
that
the
property
was
abandoned.
they
went
one
step
further
and
pointed
out
that
they
weren't
impressed
with
my
particular
argument
that
he
had
a
heightened
expectation
of
privacy
because
the
trash
barrel
was
within
the
curtilage;
and
went
directly
from
there
to
the
automobile
exception.
now,
i
don't
object
to
law
enforcement
doing
their
job
well.
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
policemen
who
want
to
search
trash.
mr.
arthur
lewis
we're
in
a
garage
where
automobiles
are
kept.
now,
in
the
brief...
and
that,
of
course,
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
we're
in
the
garage.
the
recital
of
the
facts
by
the
court
of
appeals
reflects
that
the
officers
saw
mr.
rooney
drive
into
the
subterranean
garage.
so
i
think
we're
safe
in
concluding
that,
one,
he
did
own
an
automobile;
and
two,
he
did
keep
it
in
the
garage.
when
we
go
to
dunn,
which
i
haven't
gotten
to,
other
than
to
discuss
the
proximity,
we
talk
about
whether
the
area
is
included
within
an
enclosure,
and
in
the
footnotes
your
honors
have
indicated
that
the
actual
enclosure
is
only
incidentally
helpful
to
this
court
in
determining
whether
it
is
or
isn't
within
the
curtilage.
and
if
i
might
just
read
from
the
footnote
where
the
court
said:
we
decline
the
government's
invitation
to
adopt
a
bright
line
rule
that
the
curtilage
should
extend
no
farther
than
the
nearest
fence
surrounding
a
fenced
house.
going
on:
the
primary
focus
is
whether
the
area
in
question
harbors
those
intimate
activities
associated
with
domestic
life
and
the
privacies
of
the
home.
it
appears
to
me
that
one's
personal
papers...
and
incidentally,
while--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--i
don't
believe
it's
the
numbers
that
give
rise
to
the
loss
of
the
privilege
of
curtilage.
i
think
it's
the
nature
of
the
activity
that
one
is
engaged
in,
and
where
one
puts
those
personal,
private
papers
one
still
does
not
want
the
world
to
see.
we
all
know
what
the
court
said
in
krivda
as
to
why
people
may
not
want
their
neighbors
reading
their
trash:
dunning
letters;
subscriptions
to
communist
literature
at
a
time
in
our
history
when
that
was
not
a
very
favorable
thing
for
one
to
do.
mr.
arthur
lewis
well,
that's
what
the
petitioner
suggested
in
their
brief,
that
we
could
burn
it,
that
we
could
shred
it,
that
we
could
throw
it
down
our
garbage
disposal,
or
we
could
eat
it.
i
don't
believe
they
suggested
the
latter;
that's
my
suggestion.
i
know
not
what
else
we
might
do.
one,
in
california,
because
of
the
smog
situation,
we
can't
burn
it
anymore,
so
we
have
a
problem.
it
was
suggested
that
it
be
thrown
into
the
fireplace.
some
of
us
don't
have
fireplaces,
and
i
don't
believe
the
fourth
amendment
is
only
restricted
to
those
of
us
who
have
a
fireplace.
we
can
put
it
in
the
paper
shredder.
however,
my
experience
indicates
that
government
has
time.
and
i
have
seen
the
results
of
paper
shredders...
perhaps
they're
not
very
effective
or
good
ones...
in
which
they're
pasted
the
materials
together
and
been
able
to
read
the
documents.
we
could
eat
it.
but
the
government
is
patient
there,
too,
because
we've
had
those
narcotics
cases
where
the
contraband
has
been
swallowed,
and
the
government
merely
waits.
so
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
if
we're
going
to
say
that
we
can
do
these
things
and
hide
it,
what
we're
inviting
is
for
the
government
to
set
up
a
screen
outside
our
sewer
and
get
our
effluent
as
it
comes
out.
and
i
don't
think
this
is
where
we're
going.
i
don't
think
this
is
what
we
want.
i
think
what
we're
losing
sight
of
here
is,
i'm
not
trying
to
restrict
the
police
from
inspecting
garbage
or
trash
when
they
think
it's
necessary.
clearly,
if
it's
on
the
top
and
it's
exposed
to
view,
you've
given
up
any
fourth
amendment
rights;
you
should
have
done
something
else.
but
i
think
mr.
rooney,
in
putting
it
in
the
bottom
half
of
his
trash
bin,
doesn't
exhibit
a
fourth
amendment
right,
whether
we
know
how
he
did
that
or
not.
mr.
arthur
lewis
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
because
if
you
have
a
dead
body
in
your
home
or
apartment.
and
after
a
period
of...
they
can't
get
in
if
they
don't
know
about
it.
when
the
odor
begins
to
make
itself
available
to
those
on
the
outside,
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
in
getting
a
warrant.
i
submit
that
the
warrant
requirement
is
not
very
difficult,
and
it's
not
very
onerous.
mr.
arthur
lewis
i
don't
go
that
far.
mr.
arthur
lewis
the
difference
is
that
you're
not
engaging
in
those
intimate
activities
of
life
that
one
expects--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--well,
this
is
where
one
is
compelled...
some
things
do
come
to
mind.
but
one
is
compelled,
because
of
modern
life,
to
live
in
an
apartment
building,
and
to
dispose
of
one's
trash.
and
the
accumulation
of
trash,
as
counsel
so
eloquently
said,
is
the
combustion
of
life.
you
have
to
get
rid
of
your
trash,
and
it
isn't
necessarily--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--then
the
question
is
simply
the
expectation
of
privacy,
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
our
trash
will
not
be
read
by
the
neighbors
or
the
police.
we
can't
control
our
neighbors,
i
understand
that.
and
the
definition
that
the
people
have
suggested
is
that
we
lose
our
right
to
privacy
when
we're
unable
to
exclude
others,
trespassers.
but
i
submit
that
i
can't
keep
uninvited
people
out
of
my
house.
trespassers
may
come
in.
i
have
been
burglarized.
but
i
haven't
lost
my
fourth
amendment
right
because
of
my
inability
to
keep
these
people
out
of
my
home.
it's
the
manifestation
of
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
arthur
lewis
that
someone
passing
by
might
be
able
to
look
into
the
subterranean
garage
and
see
this
trash
bin.
mr.
arthur
lewis
there's
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
think
counsel
would
agree
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
it
was
open
to
the
public.
mr.
arthur
lewis
i'm
prepared
to
concede
that
the
trash
can,
the
trash
bin,
is
visible.
mr.
arthur
lewis
i
would
submit
that
one
could
go
into
the
subterranean
garage,
be
he
a
policeman
or
some
stranger,
and
touch
the
trash.
but
i
would
submit
that
mr.
rooney
would
have
the
right
to
eject
someone
who
doesn't
live
there,
belong
there,
or
whatever
else.
mr.
rooney
would
always
have
the
right
to
reclaim
his
trash.
if
mr.
rooney
were
going
to
the
trash
bin
to
deposit
it.
and
if
the
police
in
their
infinite
wisdom
knew
that
one
day
he
would
have
to
get
rid
of
his
trash,
and
having
no
probable
cause...
see,
that's
the
thing
that
disturbs
me.
there
is
no
probable
cause
here.
it's
been
conceded.
it's
been
admitted.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
there
should
be
the
requirement
of
some
strong
suspicion,
and
in
the
court
of
appeal
they
said,
the
automobile
exception
might
apply,
because
trash
is
somewhat
moveable,
albeit
not
by
the
owner
of
the
bin.
the
garbage
truck
man
can
come
along
and
take
it.
if
there's
any
exigent
circumstance--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--correct.
correct.
and
i
would
only
ask
this
court
to
limit
it
to
that.
they
don't
need
a
warrant
if
they
have
probable
cause
and
an
exigent
circumstance.
that's
all
we're
seeking
here.
mr.
arthur
lewis
mr.
rooney
has
a
problem.
he
has
the
same
problem
that
any
of
us
have.
mr.
arthur
lewis
whether
he's
able
to
get
it
back
doesn't
determine
his
right
to
have
it.
if
it
was
a
policeman
who
seized
it,
clearly
he
isn't
going
to
get
it
from
him
if
the
policeman
doesn't
want
to
give
it
to
him.
mr.
arthur
lewis
if
they
take
it
out,
he
doesn't
know
about
it,
they
turn
it
over
to
the
police,
it's
the
same
problem
we
have
with
any
third
party
who
confronts
the
police
with
some
illegally
obtained
items;
it's
not
police
conduct.
what
we're
looking
for
here,
and
what
we're
asking
this
court
and
imploring
it,
really,
because
we're
losing
gradually
so
much
of
our
fourth
amendment
rights
under
so
many
different
theories.
i
would
hate
to
see
one
more
step
be
taken
in
that
direction.
mr.
rooney's
trash
is
in
that
bin.
if
as
he
deposits
it
a
neighbor
or
a
policeman
takes
it
out
in
his
presence,
i
say
that
mr.
rooney
would
have
the
right
to
say,
no,
that's
my
trash;
i
don't
want
you
to
have
it.
if
mr.
rooney
were
to
come
down
in
the
middle
of
the
night
hoping
nobody
sees
it
and
put
it
in
there
and
the
police
were
to
seize
it,
he
may
have
lost
that
right.
that
it's
the
governmental
intrusion
that
we're
looking
for.
it
has
been
suggested
that
when
one
puts
one's
trash
out
on
the
sidewalk,
it's
government
we're
turning
it
over
to.
and
i
submit,
no,
we're
turning
it
over
to
perhaps
a
government
sanitation
inspector,
a
government
whatever
else,
but
not
a
government
policeman.
mr.
arthur
lewis
yes.
mr.
arthur
lewis
i
think
so,
just
as
much
as
you
can
claim
the
ring.
certainly
you'd
have
the
right
to
claim
a
ring
that
you
threw
in
there,
or
any
other
thing
of
value,
and
if
you
think
that
some
of
that
stuff
has
value
that
you
don't
want
it
go
to
somebody--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--i'm
not
prepared...
if
they
refused
to
give
it
to
you,
i
think
you
would
have
a
cause
of
action;
whether
it
would
be
in
criminal
law,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say.
because,
you
know,
there
are
certain
other
elements
that
come
into
play.
mr.
arthur
lewis
yes.
mr.
arthur
lewis
well,
i
think
one
would
have
the
right,
in
front
of
one's
home
or
even
in
the
subterranean
garage,
to
keep
one's
trash
from
one's
neighbors.
if
you
have
a
single
family
home,
and
your
neighbor
is
coming,
then
i
think
it's
incumbent
upon
you
to--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--i
say,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
lewis
i
follow
it
to
the
dump
until
such
time
it
has
been
mixed
with
a
large
conglomeration
of
trash
elsewhere
and
lost
its
identity.
i
truly
feel--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
arthur
lewis
well,
it
happens
to,
and
i
think
one
of
the
things
i
did,
counsel
did,
was
to
begin
to
talk
to
friends
and
acquaintances
about,
what
do
you
think
happens
to
your
trash?
do
you
have
any
objection--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--well,
i
think
against
government
intrusion,
yes.
i
think
people
do
have
a
right
to
expect--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--but
he's
not
a
policeman
inclined
to
take
this
for
whatever
particular
purpose.
what
i
submit
is,
there
are
different
levels
of
government.
the
government
trashman
is
a
government
trashman.
one
expects
the
government
trashman
to
take
it
out
to
the
trash
and
dispose
of
it.
one
of
the
things
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
as
well
is,
that
if
this
is...
we're
not
hamstringing
the
police
by
trying
to
prevent
them
from
looking
at
trash.
if
they
have
no
probable
cause
to
believe
somebody's
engaged
in
criminal
conduct,
it
would
be
clear
that
they
don't
want
to
go
through
everybody's
trash.
it's
not
one
of
those
normal,
routine,
governmental
or
police
functions.
one
of
the
things
we
attempted
to
do
in
our
brief
was
to
point
out
all
of
the
objections
that
the
petitioners
had
and
the
briefs
of
amici
in
here
as
to
why
they
don't
like
what
is
occurring,
that
the
police
are
being
hamstrung.
i
find
it
significant,
even
ceraolo,
which
held
that
within
the
curtilage,
he
didn't
take
care
to
see
that
it
couldn't
be
seen
from
a
flying
airplane.
i
thought
that
mr.
rooney
was
perhaps
prescient
in
moving
his
trash
into
an
underground
garage.
i
suppose
the
next
thing
is
whether
he
has
to
be
careful
of
a
low
flying
helicopter.
but
what
he
has
done
is
to
put
it
in
an
opaque
paper
bag
and
put
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
bin.
he's
done--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--absolutely
right.
since
we
don't
know,
i
think
we're
bound
by
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
visible
to
people
passing
by.
mr.
arthur
lewis
i
don't
think
the
color
of
course
would
do
it,
or
whether
it
would
be
paper
or
plastic.
i
think
as
long
as
it's
opaque--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--yes,
if
he
threw
them
in
the
containers,
and
someone
could...
a
policeman
come
by,
because
if
a
neighbor
came
by
and
saw
it,
not
much
would
happen
unless
the
neighbor
wanted
to
take
it
to
the
police,
and
if
they
did,
then
of
course
the
police
may
use
that.
if
a
policeman
came
by
for
whatever
reason,
perhaps
he's
in
an
area
where
he
has
a
right
to
be,
and
he
looks
in
the
trash
and
he
sees
it,
we
have
many
cases
like
that.
clearly,
yes,
then
he
has
a
right
to
seize
it.
but
when
all
we
know
is
that
it's
in
a
opaque
bag
and
it's
in
the
bottom
of
the
trash,
i
don't
see
why
we
take
his
fourth
amendment
right
away.
he
has
done
something
to
indicate
a
desire
for
privacy.
mr.
arthur
lewis
well,
that's
correct.
but
what
we're
doing
here
is
indicating
not
that
we
want
to
keep
it
secret...
if
i
used
that
term,
then
i
apologize,
and
i
should
have
said,
he's
evidenced
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
it.
he's
not
publishing
it
to
the
world,
nor
does
he
want
it--
mr.
arthur
lewis
--because
it's
an
open
fields.
and
this
court
has
said,
we're
not
going
to
extend
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
open
fields.
mr.
arthur
lewis
that
isn't
a
part
of
the
curtilage
where
one
would
normally
expect...
i
say,
no,
he
doesn't
have
it
there.
mr.
arthur
lewis
i
can't
extend
the
privacy
argument
to
the
placing
of
trash
in
a
public
park
on
or
under
a
bench.
i
can't
do
that.
these
are
somewhat
related,
and
i
think
that's
why
they've
got
to
be
considered.
i
objected
to
the
petitioners
trying
to
say
that
this
is
an
abandonment
case.
i
submit
it's
a
curtilage
case
as
well.
if
we
go
through
the
rest
of
the
items
in
dunn,
it's
the
nature
of
the
use
to
which
the
area
is
put.
and
i
submit,
household
trash,
storing
it
and
taking
it
to
the
trash
man,
is
that
sort
of
activity.
then
of
course
this
court
pointed
out,
the
steps
taken
by
the
resident
to
protect
the
area
from
observations
by
people
passing
by.
and
i
submit
that
the
size
of
the
trash
container,
where
it
was,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
what
he
put
there
was
visible
without
it.
but
i
would
close
with
this
final
statement
that
we
find
in
dunn.
as
professor
amsterdam
has
observed,
the
question
is
not
whether
you
or
i
must
draw
the
blinds
before
we
commit
a
crime.
it
is
whether
you
and
i
must
discipline
ourselves
to
draw
the
blinds
everytime
we
enter
a
room
under
pain
of
surveillance
if
we
do
not.
and
that's
the
sort
of
thing
i
would
hate
to
see
the
country
come
to.
i
had
a
number
of
other
items.
yes,
the
closing
that
i
would
like
to
leave
you
with
was
the
objection
by
one
of
the
amici
to
this
court
was
that
if
you
couldn't
decide
it
on
the
issue
of
abandonment
and
curtilage,
that
you
ought
to
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
leon,
and
that
is,
that
there's
a
good
faith
belief
on
the
part
of
the
officer.
and
that
somewhat
struck
me
as
being
a
last
gasp
sort
of
thing.
because
in
california,
krivda's
been
the
law
for
some
15
years.
and
why
policemen
are
still
going
through
the
trash
is
somewhat
of
a
mystery.
i
would
point
out
to
this
court
that
almost
every
year,
ever
since
krivda,
we
still
have
policeman
taking
the
trash,
getting
the
trash
truck,
and
going
through
it.
this
argument
is
fought
all
the
time.
there
is
obviously
not
a
response
to
what
it
is
that
the
courts
are
saying.
and
i'm
asking
this
court
to
send
another
message,
that
if
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
one's
items,
that
it
has
got
to
be
respected.
