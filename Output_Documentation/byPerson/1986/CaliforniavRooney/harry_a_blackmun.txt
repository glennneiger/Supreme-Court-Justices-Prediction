mr.
guminski,
these
containers
of
this
size
are
common
in
this
area,
as
they
must
be
in
california.
do
you
know,
or
does
the
record
or
the
affidavit
show,
that...
how
the
trash
got
into
the
big...
the
depository?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
don't
know
whether
it
came
down
there
through
a
chute,
or
whether
the
tenants
came
down
and
threw
it
in,
or
anything
of
that
kind?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
get
back
to
justice
stevens'
private
home.
instead
of
having
the
trash
can
in
the
garage,
he
puts
it
out
on
monday
morning
out
on
the
curb.
it's
his
trash
can.
there...
only
his
trash
is
in
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that...?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
there's
no
abandonment
of
title?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
to
the
trash.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
a
little
while
ago
you
said
that
there
was
abandonment
of
ownership
of
trash
out
on
the
curb.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
suppose
his
wife's
diamond
ring
fell
in
it
by
mistake.
she
hasn't
abandoned
any
claim
to
ownership,
has
she?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
don't
only
suppose,
you
know,
don't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
keep
saying
all
the
time,
he
put
it
in
the
bottom
of
the
bin.
how
do
you
know
that?
he
might
have
put
it...
just
thrown
it
in,
and
20
other
tenants
came
down
and
put
things
on
top
of
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
it
make
my
difference
if
it
were
not
in
a
brown
paper
bag?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
it
were
not
in
a
bag,
what
if
he
just
threw
the
betting
tickets
in
the
container
as
he
went
by?
