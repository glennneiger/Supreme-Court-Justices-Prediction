ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
north
carolina
administers
its
afdc
program
in
conformity
with
federal
law
as
explained
by
the
solicitor
general
and
as
stated
in
the
briefs
for
the
appellant.
i
would
like
to
make
two
points
to
this
court.
first,
the
district
court
below
found
an
unconstitutional
taking
based
upon
its
erroneous
interpretarion
of
north
carolina
law
regarding
child
support.
secondly,
the
court
committed
a
fundamental
error
in
ordering
retroactive
benefits
in
this
case.
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
no.
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
taking
in
this
case
because
this
is
a
voluntary
decision;
this
is
an
eligibility
requirement.
you
don't
really
get
to
the
taking
of
property.
it's
a
voluntary
decision
on
the
mother's
part.
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
in...
judge
mcmillan
found
that
because
these
children
lived
together,
and
they
must
apply
for
afdc
as
a
family
unit,
and
therefore,
by
law,
assignment...
there
must
be
an
assignment
of
child
support
rights.
he
found
that
certain
property
interests
were
taken.
but
the
property
interest--
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
--of
the
child.
the
property
interest
he
explained
in
his
opinion
was
that
child
support
is
an
exclusive
property
right
in
north
carolina.
the
other
right
that
i
could
glean
from
the
opinion
is
that
he
says
that
the
child
has
an
absolute
exclusive
right
to
enforce
the
obligation
of
the
custodial
parent;
and
in
this
case,
i'm
just
going
to
use
mother,
that's
a
little
easier,
to
enforce
the--
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
--what
i
would
like
to
show
you
is,
that
is
an
erroneous
interpretation.
it
is
not
correct.
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
you
should,
unless
it
is...
i
would
not
think
that
this
court
would
accept
the
interpretation
of
state
law
if
it
is
clearly
shown
to
be
incorrect,
and
that
is
what
i
would
like
to
show
you
today.
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
they
will
attempt
to
do
the
exact
opposite.
the
second
property
right
that
judge
mcmillan
found
was
taken
was,
as
he
described
it,
the
exclusive
right
of
the
child
to
enforce
the
obligation
of
the
parent
to
spend
child
support
money
only
on
that
child.
what
our...
this
is
simply
not
the
law
of
north
carolina.
what
our
statutes
read
is
that
child
support
is
ordered,
the
primary
obligation
is
placed
upon
the
mother
and
the
father.
child
support
is
ordered
to
meet
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
child.
then
child
support
is
paid
to
the
custodial
parent
for
the
benefit
of
the
child.
in
north
carolina,
the
child
does
have
the
right
to
enforce
the
obligation
of
the
mother
to
use
child
support
for
his
or
her
benefit.
north
carolina
has,
by
statute,
passed...
passed
a
law
that
deems
the
assignment
of
child
support
rights,
the
obligation
to
receive
support,
upon
the
acceptance
of
public
assistance.
this
is
a
statute
that
has
been
enacted
in
north
carolina.
the
rationale
of
judge
mcmillan
below--
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
--it
was
not
so
considered
by
the
legislature
of
north
carolina,
nor
the
courts
of
north
carolina,
which
has
considered...
which
has
passed
upon
this
statute.
and
i
would
say
that
this
is
an
area
of
family
law
in
north
carolina.
the
rationale
of--
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
--the
court
below
ignored
it.
it
was
not
mentioned
in
his
opinion.
it
was
raised--
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
--pardon?
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
this
was
raised
to
the
court
below.
the
briefs
are
in
the
record,
the
docket
that
has
been
sent
to
you,
on
page
32
of
the
appellees'
memorandum
for
motion
for
further
relief.
this
was
filed
may
30th,
1985.
this
very
statute,
the
provision...
this
is
contained
in
chapter
110
of
the
north
carolina
general
statutes.
this
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
in
order
to
reach
his
opinion
of
this
exclusive
property
right,
you
have
to
ignore
that
statute
because--
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
--you
have
to
read
the
north
carolina
child
support
law
in
conjunction
with
the
statutes.
these
statutes
have
to
be
read
together.
judge
mcmillan's
rationale--
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
--there
is
no
statute
in
north
carolina
that
says,
child
support
is
an
exclusive
property
right
of
the
child.
north
carolina
law
places
primary
emphasis
on
the
obligation
of
a
parent
to
support
his
child.
that
is
the
right
that
the
child
has,
is
to
enforce
that
obligation.
reading
the
statutes
again,
the
child
has
the
right--
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
--and
didn't...
that
would
be
that
the
mother
was
not
spending
the
money
for
the
benefit
of
the
child.
this
is,
to
me,
another
fundamental
error
in
judge
mcmillan's
opinion.
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
she
is
breaking...
in
that
case,
she
is
breaking
her
fiduciary
to
that
child,
if
this...
if
she
is
leaving
her
child--
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
--and
this
was
her
only
income?
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
in
your
hypothetical,
is
that
the
only
income
that
is
coming
into
that
family,
is
$250
child
support
for
one
child?
in
that
case,
the
mother...
it
would
be
within
the
mother's
discretion...
these
are
not
easy
decisions,
but
it
would
be
within
the
mother's
discretion
to
determine
what
is
the
best
interest
of
that
child.
she
receives
child
support
under
our
statutes.
the
statute
does
not
read,
child
support
shall
be
received
to
be
spent
to
benefit
that
child.
child
support
is
received
for
the
custodial
parent
to
be
used
for
the
minor
child's
benefit.
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
it
would
be
a
decision
that
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
mother.
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
the
answer
is
yes
if
she,
within
her
discretion,
determines
that
that
would
best
benefit
her
child.
that,
to
me,
is
a
fundamental
problem
with
judge
mcmillan's
analysis
in
this
case,
because
he
is
undermining
well
established
law
in
north
carolina
that
the
custodial
parent
has
great
flexibility
in
determining
what
is
in
the
best
interest.
a
parent
may
not
profit
at
the
expense
of
her
child.
if
this
is
determined
to
be
the
case,
an
action
may
be
brought
on
the
child's
behalf
in
order
to
compel
the
mother
to
act
in
his
best
interest.
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
then
that
is
her
choice.
participation
in
the
afdc
program
is
a
voluntary
decision.
this
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
mother,
once
again.
if
she
decides
that
it
is
not
in
that
child's
best
interest
that
it...
for
whatever
reason,
she
decides
that
johnny
should
have
every
bit
of
that
money,
no
matter
what,
she
has
a
voluntary
decision
that
she
can
make
that
she
will
not
participate--
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
--this
is
a
decision
that
she
can
make.
it
is
a
hard
decision.
i
am
not
saying
that
these
decisions
are
easy
decisions.
but
these
are
decisions
that
are
within
the
discretion
of
the
parent
and
authorized
under
north
carolina
law.
ms.
catherine
c.
mclamb
you
will
be
able
to
make
your
entire
argument.
the
court
won't
rise
to
lunch
until
this
case
is
submitted.
