mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
here
involves
the
validity
of
an
amendment
to
the
afdc
program
that
congress
enacted
in
1984,
a
provision
i
shall
refer
to
as
the
standard
filing
unit
provision.
this
amendment
was
one
of
many
budget
cutting
steps
that
congress
took
in
that
year,
and
it
was
designed
to
close
what
congress
viewed
as
a
loophole
in
the
afdc
eligibility
scheme.
under
prior
law,
a
family
applying
for
afdc
could
try
to
maximize
its
afdc
grant
by
excluding
from
the
filing
unit
certain
family
members,
typically
children
who
had
other
sources
of
income,
such
as
social
security
benefits,
child
support,
or
accountable
earnings
from
employment.
this
enabled
the
family
to
get
the
maximum
afdc
grant
for
the
members
in
the
unit,
plus
keep
all
of
the
other
income
of
the
members
who
were
left
out
of
the
unit.
in
1984
congress
decided
to
eliminate
this
benefit
maximizing
option
by
enacting
the
provision
challenged
here.
it
requires
that
when
a
family
applies
for
afdc,
all
members
of
the
family
who
live
together
must
be
included
in
the
filing
unit,
and
that
the
income
of
all
those
family
members
must
be
added
up
to
figure
out
how
needy
the
family
is
for
public
assistance.
congress
based
this
amendment
on
the
belief
that
family
members
who
live
near
the
poverty
level
and
who
live
together
tend
to
share
their
income
and
expenses;
and
that
therefore
the
most
reliable
index
of
the
family's
need
for
public
assistance
was
the
total
income
of
the
family
members.
thus,
rather
than
simply
cutting
afdc
to
families
across
the
board,
congress
sought
to
target
the
benefit
cuts
in
1984
to
those
families
that
were,
because
of
the
members
separate
income,
less
needy.
now,
appellees,
of
course,
have
no
constitutional
right
to
a
permanently
fixed
level
of
afdc
benefits,
and
they
therefore
recognize
that
they
could
not
bring
a
constitutional
challenge
to
a
decision
by
congress
simply
to
cut
benefit
levels
without
more.
what
they
argue,
therefore,
is
that
congress
did
not
really
cut
afdc
benefits
here,
but
rather
took
property
away
from
the
children
who
are
required
to
be
newly
included
in
the
filing
unit.
appellees
focus
on
child
support
income,
and
especially
on
the
assignment
provision
enacted
in
1975
which
requires
a
mother
who
applies
for
afdc
to
assign
to
the
state
any
right
to
support
that
she
or
her
child
may
have.
this
provision
was
designed
to
improve
collection
of
delinquent
child
support
by
transferring
the
burden
of
collection
from
the
abandoned
mother
to
the
state
with
its
greater
enforcement
resources.
now,
the
assignment
provision
by
itself
works
no
hardship
on
the
family,
because
for
every
dollar
of
support
assigned
to
the
state,
one
dollar
of
afdc
comes
back
to
the
family.
moreover,
a
family
that
assigns
child
support
also
receives
an
extra
$50
a
month
from
the
state
by
virtue
of
the
child
support
disregard
provision.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
appellee's
theory,
that
the
effect
of
the
assignment
provision
is
to
take
the
property
of
the
child--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--and
transmute
that
into
afdc
and
give
it
to
the
whole
family.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
why
is
their
theory
wrong?
well,
we
think
their
theory,
their
taking
theory,
is
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
premise
of
their
theory--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--she
could.
she
is
required
to
spend
the
money
in
the
best
interests
of
all
her
children,
and
she
could
decide
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think
the
afdc
program
also
imposes
obligations
on
mothers
with
respect
to
how
they
spend
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
could
be
joey,
she
thinks,
is
more
needy
than
other
children.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
would.
it
would
depend
on
what
the
other
children
needed.
i
mean,
the
way
the
mother
spends
the
afdc
money--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--with
all
probability,
the
money,
the
$200,
would
be
going
to
pay
things
that
are
common
expenses,
like
rent,
utilities,
gas
and
light.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
can't
say
that
would
absolutely
violate
the
afdc
law.
i
don't
think
it's
clear.
it
depends--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--on
the
family
situation.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
is
clear
that
some
use
of
that
money
could
violate
the
afdc
reasons
governing
the
duties
of
the
custodial
parent.
and
i
don't
think
you
can
say
without
knowing
all
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no,
all
of
it
would
come
back
to
the
family,
plus
$50
extra.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
$200
comes
to
the
family
in
a
different
form.
it
doesn't
come
qua
child
support;
it
comes
qua
afdc
benefits.
but
they
get
the
same
$200
from
a
different
source,
as
it
were.
plus,
if
the
state
actually
collects
the
child
support,
they
get
$50
more.
so
the
bottom
line
is,
they
have
$250,
although
it
comes
from
a
different
place,
rather
than
$200
if
they
just
got
the
child
support.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
of
course,
if
the
parent
doesn't
pay,
and
there
had
been
no
assignment,
the
family
would
have
gotten
nothing
whatsoever.
if
the
parent
doesn't
pay,
at
least
they
get
the
$200
in
afdc
benefit
by
virtue
of
the
assignment.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
would
be
$200
of
it--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that's
correct.
the
child's
pro
rata
share,
as
it
were--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that's
right.
if
you
look
at--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
that
raises
a
question
under
state
law.
and
this
is
the
first
reason
we--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that's
correct.
the
father's
obligation
to
pay
support
runs
to
his
child,
and
the
amount
he
pays
is
determined
both
by
the
child's
need,
his
ability
to
pay,
his
wealth--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--we
think
that's
not
correct.
that's
what
the
other
side
contends.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
if
the
mother
had
an
obligation
to
pay
it
only--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
for
the
benefit
of
the
child
is
different
from
giving
him
the
cash.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
and
here,
the
state
law
clearly
permits
the
mother
to
assign
child
support
in
order
to
get
afdc
for
the
entire
family.
so
it's
clear
that
here
state
law
does
permit
the
mother,
in
the
best
interests
of
that
child
to
support...
to
assign
the
support
money
to
the
state.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
does
require
it,
in
fact,
that's
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that
would--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
that
raises
a
question
about
how
the
support
is
paid.
the
afdc
statute
permits
states
to
either
include
or
exclude
in-kind
payments
from
income
for
purposes
of
afdc
eligibility.
now
if
the
father...
in
the
support
decree
it
said
the
father
would
pay
the
dentist
bills
himself,
that
would...
rather
than
pay
money
to
the
mother,
have
her
pay
the
bills,
that
would
be
treated,
i
think
by
north
carolina,
as
an
in-kind
payment
that
wouldn't
count.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
let
me
co-counsel
respond
to
that.
i
don't
know
all
the
north
carolina
cases.
but
i
believe
north
carolina
has
exercised
the
option
not
to
count
in-kind
payments
as
income.
so
the
key
thing
under
north
carolina
law
is
whether
the
money
comes
in
cash
to
the
mother,
to
use
at
her
discretion.
if
it
does
not,
if
it
comes
in
kind,
or
if
it
is
paid
to
a
third
party
by
the
parent,
that
would
not
count
as
income.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
would.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
how
the...
what
the
judge
keyed
the
money
to.
if
he
keyed
it
to--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think
for
something
very
quasi-optional
or
a
cosmetic
thing
like
that,
she
probably
could
prefer
one
child
over
another,
as
any
mother
could
in
deciding
which
kid
is
going
to
have
braces.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
a
mother
always
has
the
option
of
deciding
how
you
are
going
to
allocate
a
fixed...
a
small
fixed
pot
of
money.
but
beyond
the
afdc--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
it
would
for
orthodontics.
but
beyond--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
would
depend
on
the
need.
if
it
were
kind
of
a
critical
life-threatening
need,
it
would
be
a
different
judgment.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
rule
that
she
has
to
treat
them
absolutely
equally.
there
has...
there's
a
range
of
reasonableness.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no,
there
is
not.
the
whole
point
of
it
is,
let
the
mother
act
like
a
mother,
and
any
other
mother,
and
decide
how
best
to
use
this
money
for
her
children.
and
beyond
the
afdc,
there
is
also
medicaid
assistance
available.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
she
probably
could
not.
i
think
it
would
be
real
hard
to
justify
that.
but
in
the
case
of
orthodonture,
i'd
like
to
point
out
again
that
the
medicaid
is
available
to
all
the
children
in
the
filing
unit
automatically.
that's
one
benefit
a
child
receives
by
virtue
of
the
assignment,
is
that
he
then
qualifies
for
medicaid
immediately,
and
that
could
well
cover
some
of
these
medical
expenses.
let
me
get
back
to
the
constitution.
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
constitutional
problem
with
the
statute,
or
it
cannot
be
declared
invalid.
and
as
i
point
out,
the
first
problem
with
the
other
side's
theory
is,
under
state
law,
a
child
does
not
really
have
an
absolute
property
right
to
child
support.
what
he
has
is
a
right
to
have
the
money
used
in
his
best
interest.
state
law
permits,
and
indeed,
requires
the
assignment
of
support
to
get
afdc
for
the
family.
and
state
law
therefore
contemplates
that
it
can
be
in
the
child's
best
interest
to
have
his
support
money
assigned
to
get
afdc
for
the
family.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it's
possible--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--but
that
would
follow
from
any
decision
by
congress
to
include
the...
any
kind...
wouldn't
have
to
supporting
him...
any
kind
of
income
of
a
child,
in
determining
the
need
of
the
family.
if
the
child
earned
money
working
at
macdonald's,
and
he
lived
with
the
family,
that
money
would
be
included
as
family
income,
and
it
might
be
better
to
him
to
live
with
his
father,
and
have
it
not
be
included.
but
i
think
it's
inevitable
if
you
have
a
family-based
grant,
as
afdc
is,
you've
got
to
look
at
the
income
of
the
people
who
live
in
the
family
to
see
how
needy
the
family
is.
and
it
could
be
that
that
would
give
an
incentive,
an
economic
incentive,
for
people
to
live
in
another
way.
but
that's
an
inevitable
consequence
of
this
family
grant
provision
congress
has
set
up.
the
second
reason
we
think
their
taking
theory
doesn't
work
is
that
the
participation
in
the
afdc
program
is
entirely
voluntary.
if
the
mother
does
not
want
to
assign
child
support,
she
need
not
take
part
in
the
afdc
program.
it
is
simply
one
of
the
many
conditions
for
eligibility
for
getting
public
benefits.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
congress
has
made
the
family
unit
the
applicant.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
if
the
child
doesn't
want
to
have
his
support
assigned,
he
can
tell
his
mother
and
she
cannot
assign
the
support.
i
mean,
the
children
depend
on
their...
monetarily
depend
on
their
mother
to
make
decisions
in
their
best
interest.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
think
under
state
law
they
couldn't
get
that
injunction,
because
it's
not
the
child's
absolute
property.
the
mother
has
to
use
it
in
his
best
interest,
and
she
can
convince--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think
ultimately
it
does.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no,
that
doesn't
follow.
you
have
to
have...
first--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
first
there's
got
to
be
property
to
be
taken.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
okay,
then
beyond
that,
you
have
to
consider
that
going
into
the
program
is
entirely
voluntary
to
begin
with.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
if
the
child
is
wrong,
and
the
mother
in
his
best
interest--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
if
you're
right
about
that,
then
she
could
be
enjoined
from
going
into
the
program.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
there
would
be
no
taking
if
she
weren't
in
the
program.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
point
is,
if
he
really
has
property--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--right.
if
he
really
has
property
and
she...
but
state
law
permits
her
to
assign
it,
so
it's
hard
to
see
how--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
if
there
is...
if
the
child
does
have
property
such
as
you
describe--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
that's
the
first
problem
with
their
argument.
but
there
are
other
problems
beyond
that
as
we
showed
in
our
brief.
