we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
two
consolidated
cases,
no.
86-509,
bowen
against
gilliard,
and
no.
86-564,
flaherty
against
gilliard.
mr.
flauber,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
gathering
from
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
and
justice
scalia
earlier,
is
there
a
fairly
elaborate
afdc
code
of
how
the
mother
shall
distribute
the
money
to
these
various
children?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lauber.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
mclamb.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you
ms.
mclamb.
ms.
wettach,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx
voluntary,
isn't
it?
she
is
not
forced
to
apply
for
afdc?
chief
justice
rehnquist
by
what
law
is
she
forced
to
apply
for
afdc?
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh,
it's
a
condition.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
did
the
child
move
to?
did
she
move
with
her
father,
or
to
somewhere
else?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there's
not
doubt
it
has
that,
it
has
federal
authorization
now,
is
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
your
case
was
purely
a
constitutional
case
here,
since
the
passage
of
the
more
recent
afdc
amendment.
do
you
still
claim
that
it's
not
authorized
by
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
district
court
didn't
agree
with
you
on
that
point?
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wettach.
the
case
is
submitted.
