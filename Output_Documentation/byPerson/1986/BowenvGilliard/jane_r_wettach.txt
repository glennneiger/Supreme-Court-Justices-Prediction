ms.
jane
r.
wettach
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
actual,
palpable,
financial
loss
to
the
plaintiff
children
in
this
case
is
quite
apparent
from
the
evidence.
the
two
daughters
of
joyce
miles,
for
example,
lost
$95
every
month
of
their
child
support.
similar
amounts
of
money
were
lost
every
month
by
other
children
in
this
case.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
we
just
walked
through
an
example
of
how
this
practice
actually
works
in
north
carolina
at
this
time.
for
example,
joyce
miles
has
five
children.
two
of
them,
the
oldest
two,
are
of
a
different
father.
the
three
younger
ones,
they
have
separate
fathers.
the
two
oldest
girls
are
the
beneficiaries
of
a
$189
a
month
child
support
payment.
it
was
ordered
by
the
state
court
judge,
who
made
a
decision
about
the
reasonable
needs
of
those
children
and
ordered
this
father
to
pay.
prior
to
1984,
when
the
rule
was
imposed,
the
mother
did
not
receive
afdc
assistance
for
those
children;
they
were
separated
from
the
grant.
she
had
three
younger
who
were
not
as
fortunate
to
have
a
father
who
chose
to
support
them,
and
she
received
$244
in
afdc
for
those
children.
in
october
of
1984
she
received
a
letter
from
the
state
department
of
human
resources,
which
said,
in
order
to
continue
receiving
afdc
for
those
children
for
whom
you
are
getting
it,
you
must
add
the
other
children
to
the
grant,
and
as
a
part
of
that,
you
must
make
their
support
available
to
the
state.
the
state
will
take
that
money,
keep
the
money;
it
will
return
$50
because
there
is
now
a
$50
disregard;
and
we'll
give
you
afdc
benefits.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
she
had
$189
to
support
the
two
older
girls.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
$244
for
the
other
three.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
$95
apiece.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
well,
in
most
of
these
cases,
the
amounts
of
money
were
not
significantly
different.
in
that
case,
as
we
said,
the
difference
between
$80
and
$95
is
not
a
lot,
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
that
she
was
spending
more
money
on
the
children
who
were
the
recipients
of
that
child
support.
she
mentioned
that...
those
were
two
teenage
girls;
she
tended
to
spend
more
money
on
them.
and--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--we
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
to
show
that
mothers
routinely
are
violating
their
court
award.
she
has
a
court
order.
it
tells
her
that
she's
got
to
spend
the
money
in
a
certain
way.
and
there's
no
evidence
that
nationwide
these
mothers--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
suit
that
a
mother
was
actually
sued--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--actually,
i
would
like
to
take
that
back.
there
was
the
case
from
which
the
district
court
found
much
of
its
law
of
north
carolina,
where
a
father
sued
the
mother
for
misusing
the
child
support
he
was
spending,
and
the
court
said...
actually
dismissed
the
case
because
the
father
was
the
wrong
party,
and
said,
the
child
support
money
belongs
to
the
children.
the
father
could
only
bring
the
suit
as
next
friend.
and
implicitly
authorized
the
father
to
be
able
to
sue
for
that
reason,
if
there
were
a
substantial
misuse
of
the
money
by
the
mother,
then
i
think
that
would
be
cognizable
under
state
law,
under
trust
theory.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
yes.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
we
feel
that--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--we
feel
that--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--we
feel
there
is
no
reason
that
this
court
should
depart
from
the
lower
court's
analysis
of
north
carolina
law.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
well,
there's
certainly...
there's
all
the
case
law.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
there's
the
case
law
that
judge
mcmillan
of
course
relied
on.
there's
also
the
statutes.
for
the
benefit
of
the
child
is
not
a
particularly
difficult
concept.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
if...
the
assignment--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
when...
when
participation
in
the
program
vis-a-vis
the
child
who
is
receiving
child
support
is
voluntary,
the
mother
can
certainly
make
the
choice
that
the
child
support
that
she
is
getting
is
inadequate
to
meet
those
needs,
and
therefore,
she
would
like
to
apply
for
afdc,
and
the
condition
of
eligibility
is
that
she
make
this
assignment
and
the
state
take
over
the
responsibility
of
collecting
that
support.
but
when
this
involuntariness
becomes
a
part
of
it,
that
changes
how
that
assignment
provision
works.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
i
think
that's
just
incorrect.
when...
if
the
mother...
that
whole
provision
of
state
law
was
written
when
it
was
a
voluntary
matter
to
apply
for
afdc.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
she
is
forced
to
apply
for
afdc
for
particular
children--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--as
a
condition
of
getting
afdc
for
some
children,
she
is
forced
to
apply
for
all
children.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
it's
a...
right.
right.
she's
not...
of
course,
nobody
is
rounding
her
up
and
telling
her
to
apply.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
judge
mcmillan
talked
at
length
about
the
assignment
provision
and
how
it
is
the
procedural
mechanism
by
which
the
state--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--he
was
certainly--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--well,
of
course,
the
assignment
law
in
state
law
doesn't
say,
and
then
it
is
deemed
to
be
in
the
benefit
of
the
child.
the
assignment
provision
simply
says,
if
you
apply
for
afdc,
you
are
deemed
to
have
made
an
assignment
of
your
child
support
to
the
state.
that's
all
it
said.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about,
for
the
benefit
of
the
children,
or
transforming
the
income
from
the
benefit
of
one
to--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--i
don't
see
how
it
would
in
any
sense.
when
you
assign
your
money
you
are
allowing
the
state
to
take
it
in,
but
it
gives
it
back
when
you
are
on
the
grant
and
you
make
the
decision
to...
you
use
the
assignment
provision
almost
as
a
trade.
you
will
trade
in
your
child
support
of
$50,
because
$50
isn't
adequate
to
meet
a
child's
needs,
so
that
you
can
get
$100
in
afdc
back.
but
that...
when
the
figures
are
different,
when
they
say,
assign
in
$100
and
get
$50
back,
that's
a
very
different
sort
of
situation,
and
a
very
different
sort
of
choice.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
they
got
$280
in
afdc
and
$50
of
the
support,
so
there
was
a
net
loss
of
$95.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
so
that's
where
the
loss.
and
of
course,
the
afdc
hasn't
gone
done;
it
is
the
child
support
that
they--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--if
you
look
at
the
whole
family
as
a
total
family
unit,
the
mathematics
work
out
that
way.
of
course,
our
position
is
that
the
constitutional
rights
belong
to
the
children
who
own
the
money
for
whom
it
is
paid.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
it
depends
on
whose
$189
it
is.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
at
what
the
state
law
says
about
that
type
of
income.
my
recollection
is
that
earned
income
under
common
law
is
to
be
owned
by
the
parents
and
at
their
discretion.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
i
think
it
depends
as
a
matter
of
state
law
what
the
nature
of
the
$189
is.
now,
i
think
that
is
a
different
case
than
when
the
mother
receives
it
in
a
fiduciary
and
trust
capacity.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
well,
that
wouldn't
be
the
case.
that
would
not
be
the
case
that
is
in
front
of
the
court--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--again,
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
income
that
you're
talking
about.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
if
in
fact
what
was
happening
was
that
money
was
being
taken
from
a
child
who
had
no
obligation
to
support
other
children,
then
i
think
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
legal
situation.
if
the
money
is
restricted
in
that
way.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
not
if--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--she's
not
losing
anything
for
the
child.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
it
keeps
it
all
but
the
first
$50
of
it,
that's
correct.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
that's
a
difficult
example,
because
those
are
not
counted
for
afdc
purposes
anyway
because--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--if
it
were
in...
if
it
were
in
the
best
interests
of
that
child,
because
it
was
only
coming
in,
say,
once
every
six
months,
then
spread
out,
she's
probably
not
violating
any
duty
she
has.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
yes,
justice
blackmun,
there
is
an
example
of
that
exact
situation
among
the
five
named
parties
that
are
the
moving
parties
in
this
case,
where
a
child
has
received--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--in
the
medland
family,
there
was
a
child,
and
she
was
entitled
to
$200...
her
father
was
paying
$200
worth
of
child
support
for
her,
and
her
mother
and
father
decided,
between
the
two
of
them,
that
she
should
move
out
of
the
house,
because
otherwise
she
would
have
to
be
included
in
the
grant,
and
her
standard
of
living
would
go
down,
and
they
did
not
wish
that
to
occur.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
indeed.
and
we
think
that's
a
very
serious
consequence
of
the
regulation,
that
that--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--in
that
particular
case,
she
moved
with
her
father.
and
of
course,
it
could
have
been
in
any
number
of
situations.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
it
seems
that
it
would
make
more
sense
for
the
court
and
the
congress
to
determine...
to
make
a
presumption
that
people
were
obeying
their
court
orders,
in
the
absence
of
some
evidence
to
the
contrary.
i
mean,
the
presumption
makes
sense
that
people
obey
the
law,
as
opposed
to,
that
people
don't
obey
the
law.
and
if...
now,
of
course,
under
afdc
law,
there
is
an
inquiry
in
every
single
case
of
every
single
applicant
about
what
money
they
have
in
the
household,
and
where
it
is.
they
send
in
a
monthly
report
every
month,
and
they
have
to
describe
these
things.
of
course,
if
there
were
money
being
spent,
then
there
may
well
be
accounting
for
that
money,
and
that's
the
way
it
would
be...
really
under
current
law,
there
would
be
that
situation,
where
if
she
were
actually
making
income
available,
it
would
be
counted.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
there
may
be
individual
circumstances
where
that
might
be
the
case.
as
a
general
rule,
though--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--there
may
well
be
some
benefits
there,
and
there
may
well
be
circumstances.
but
to
say
as
a
matter
of
law,
which
we
have
here,
that
the
mother
must
make
that
choice
is
the
difficulty
with
it.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
again,
that
may
be--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--that
would
have
to
be
made
on
an
individual
basis
as
to
what
is
in
the
best
interest.
and
perhaps
somebody
could
prove
to
a
court...
a
state
court
in
a...
in
a
hearing
on
it
that
it
was
or
it
wasn't
in
the
best
interest
of
that
particular
child.
but
on
its
face,
to
take
money
from
one
child
and
spend
it
on
the
other
child
takes
away
from
the
state...
state
court
order
that
says,
this
$200
is
to
be
used
for
a
particular
child;
it
takes
away
from
the
father's
expectation
that
he
will
support
his
children,
and
not
be
expected
to
offset
expenditures
made
by
the
afdc
program
for
other
children
to
whom
he
is
unrelated.
and
that
disruption
is
a
significant
problem.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
but
that
may
be
because
there...
she's
being
put
under
this
unconstitutional
condition
that
she
has
to
do
that.
and
maybe
given
an
unconstitutional
condition
on
this
program,
once
decisions
about
what's
in
the
best
interest,
may
have
to
be
different.
but
should
the
government
be
putting
her
in
the
position
of
having
to
make
that
choice?
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
well,
it
certainly--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--that
is
a
separate...
that's
right.
and
it's
another
theory
of
liability
for
the
government.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
yes,
justice
o'connor,
there
was
one
which
was
cited
in
our
brief
that
we
were
aware
of
because
it
was
local,
and
the
state...
it
was
a
situation
where
the
father
was
providing
a
certain
amount
of
support,
and
he
went
in
and
said,
look,
this
is
what's
happening
and
what
happened
in
that
case
is,
the
state
judge
ordered
that
the
family
be
severed
for
afdc
purpose,
and
he
ordered
the
county
to
continue
to
pay
afdc
for
the
other
children,
and
allowed
the
father
to
make
in-kind
payments
to
off...
so
that
they
wouldn't
be
counted.
and
there
was
another
situation
that
was
presented
by
this
case
where
the
father
was
paying
$200
a
month
voluntarily
without
a
court
order.
when
the
benefits
were
assigned,
and
he
went...
and
the
county
brought
suit
against
him,
they
reduced
the
amount
to
$87
a
month.
so
that
in
fact,
they...
when
you
worked
out
the
figures,
he
didn't
lose
that
much
by
being
on
afdc,
but
of
course,
the
father
was
willing
and
able
to
pay
much
more
for
his
support.
but
it
wouldn't
have
mattered.
his
child
would
have
stayed
at
the
same
standard
of
living
of
an
afdc
family,
regardless
of
how
much
the
father
had
paid;
and
so
the
support
was
reduced.
the
state
has
not
talked
too
much
about
the
remedy
that
was
imposed.
but
i'd
like
to
say
just
a
few
words
about
that
as
it
is
presented
by
this
case.
the
state
has
mentioned
in
its
brief
that
the
remedy
was
incorrect
in
this
case
for
a
number
of
reasons.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
from
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
that
there
was
a
violation
of
an
injunction.
the
injunction
was
entered
in
1971,
and
it
was
clearly...
it
was
to
remedy
the
exact
same
thing
that
was
going
on
in
1971
as
part
of
the
state
program.
at
that
point
it
did
not
have
the
cloak
of
federal
authorization
as
it
claims
to
have
now.
but
it
was
in
fact--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--it
has
federal
statutory
authorization
under
their
theory
of
the
statute.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
we
have
in
our
brief
suggested
that
the
statute
can
be
read
in
a
different
way
which
would
not
cause
the
constitutional
problems
that
are
caused
by
the
application
as
it's
been
given
by
secretary
bowen.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
that's
correct.
but
in
this
case,
there
has...
there
was
the
same
activity
by
the
welfare
department
in
1971.
that
activity
was
enjoined.
and
in
1984,
it
was
flouted
by
the
state.
the
injunction
was
simply
ignored,
and
the
state
made
a
decision
to
proceed
as
it
had
been
before
1971,
and
before
it
was
enjoined.
the
state
has
argued
that
the
remedy
that
the
lower
court
ordered,
which
was
to
pay
back
all
the
child
support
money
that
it
had
taken,
and
pay
back
any
afdc
benefits
which
were
withheld,
or
for
families
that
were
terminated
as
a
result
of
this,
would
violate
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
think
there
is
no
question
that
it
would
not
violate
the
eleventh
amendment
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
of
course,
it
is--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--yes.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
yes.
yes,
it
was
argued
below,
and
it
was...
the
theory
was
rejected
by
the
lower
court,
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
on
that
issue
as
well.
what
had
been
argued,
and
is
argued
here
in
their
briefs,
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
would
bar
it
because
this
was
effectively
retroactive
benefits.
the
error
in
that
position
is
the
language
of
edelman
v.
jordan,
which
says
that
the
date
for
determining
prospective
and
retrospective
relief
is
the
date
of
a
court-ordered
obligation
to
act
otherwise.
this
court
order
was
entered
in
1971.
and
from
then
they
had
to
act
accordingly.
that
was
a
prospective
order,
and
that
was
not
barred
in
any
way
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
state's
position
appears
to
be
that
as
soon
as
it
violated
the
injunction,
anything
that
it
didn't
pay
was
transformed
into
retroactive
payments,
and
therefore,
were
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
we
think
that
that
position
doesn't
make
sense,
and
is
not
consistent
with
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
we
think
it
would
be
quite
reasonable
for
the
federal
government,
and
constitutional,
to
have
looked
at
that
family,
looked
at
the
afdc
recipients,
and
determined
how
much
their
need
was
actually
reduced
by
the
fact
that
someone
else
in
the
household
may
have
been
sharing
the
burden
of
the
joint
expenses.
this
is
particularly
set
out
in
our
brief
when
we
talk
about
an
economy
of
scale
reduction
that
could
be
made
in
an
afdc
payment.
for
example,
if
there...
well,
there's
a
chart
that
talks
about,
what's
the
individual's
standard
of
need
in
a
family.
and
we
all
know
that
that
individual
goes
down
as
the
household
gets
larger,
because
you
need...
if
you
have
an
apartment
that--
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
--it's
not
that
they're
counted.
they're
not
counted
at
all.
all
they're
doing
is,
you
recognize
that
the
need
of
the
afdc
recipients
is
less
because
they
don't
have
to
share
the
whole...
they
don't
have
to
pay
for...
for
example,
they
don't
have
to
pay
for
all
of
the
rent,
or
all
of
the
utilities,
the
shared
expenses,
because
there's
someone
else
with
income
who
is
sharing.
so
maybe
there's
a
quarter
of
it
that
is
paid
by
someone
who
is
not
in
the
unit,
so
they
only
have
to
pay
for
three-quarters
of
it.
so
their
need
is
a
little
bit
less.
ms.
jane
r.
wettach
no,
i
think
i
told
you
that
there
is
a
way
that
they
can
do
it.
and
they
can
do
it
in
either
of
the
two
ways
we
suggested.
actually,
they
can
do
it
by
an
economy
of
scale
reduction
of
the
afdc
recipients,
or
they
can
do
it
by
an
individual
analysis
of
what
is
going
on
in
a
family,
and
if
money
is
actually
being
transferred,
they
might
count
it.
let's
take
an
example
where
there
are
three
people
in
a
household.
the
child
support
child
gets
$100,
the
other
two
get
$200
in
afdc.
the
mother
uses
all
the
money
the
same.
their
need
is
the
same.
to
say...
then
there's
no
transfer,
and
that's
when
congress
can't
take
it
into
account.
but
to
say
that
these
two
need
a
little
less
because
there's
a
person
outside
the
unit
who
is
also
contributing
is
reasonable,
and
congress
could
cut
in
that
matter.
and
we
think
that's
constitutional,
and
we
would
have
no
complaints
with
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
