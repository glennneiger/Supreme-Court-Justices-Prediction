justice
stevens
mr.
lauber,
may
i
just
follow
up
on
justice
o'connor's
example
of
the
orthodontic
special
need
of
one
child
for
whom
the
support
money
is
designated?
supposing
it's
not
done
in
kind,
but
is
just
the
reason
the
judge
fixed
the
support
amount
at
that
amount.
and
then
it
goes
through
the
afdc
and
comes
back
to
the
mother.
would
it
violate
the
afdc
rules
for
the
mother
to
use
the
money
for
the
purpose
intended
by
the
judge,
in
other
words,
giving
a
disproportionate
share
to
the
child
for
whom
the
support
money
was
paid?
justice
stevens
well,
it
would
depend
on
what
the
need
of
the
other
children
were.
it
would
depend
on
what
the
need
of
the
other
children
was.
say
there
were
three
children.
they
all
had
the
same
orthodontic
problem.
and
they'd
like
to
spend
money
on
all
three,
but
the
money
is
there
because
of
the
orthodontic
problem
of
the
child
of
the
father
providing
the
money.
could
the
mother,
without
violating
afdc
rules,
prefer
one
of
the
three
children
who
is
the
source
of
the
money?
justice
stevens
even
though
the
three
have
the
same
needs?
that's
my
assumption:
the
three
have
the
same
needs,
but
the
need
of
one
is
what
produced
the
money.
and
that
would
not
violate
afdc?
justice
stevens
your
answer
is,
it
would
not
violate
afdc
law?
justice
stevens
mr.
lauber--
--well,
for
anything.
would
it
for
anything?
maybe
we've
picked
a
bad--
justice
stevens
--well,
of
all
three,
three
critical
life-threatening
needs,
but
the
source
of
the
money
is
because
of
the
support
for
the
one.
could
the
mother...
would
it...
is
there
an
afdc
rule
that
the
mother
must
treat
the
needy
children
equally,
despite
the
fact
that
one
of
them
produces
the
money?
justice
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
you
always
get
at
least
the
amount
you
assign
back,
and
sometimes
plus
$50?
you
example
of
$189
of
child
support
and
$244
they
had
before,
a
total
of
$400
and
something;
what
did
they
get
after
she
made
the
assignment?
justice
stevens
so
they
only
got...
i
see.
justice
stevens
i
just
want
to
be
sure
about
one
thing.
assume
there's
child
support
for
just
a
second,
and
assume
that
the
$189
was
income
from
working
at
macdonald's,
and
that
was
it,
and
we
didn't
have
a
child
support
in
this
case
at
all.
would
it
still
be
unconstitutional...
program
still
be
unconstitutional
to
require
them
to
count
all
the
money
in
one
pool.
justice
stevens
it's
the
teenage
daughters.
two
teenage
daughters,
both
work,
and
they
earned
$189,
and
they'd
like
to
spend
it
on
themselves.
but
under
the
new
rule,
they
must
count
that
as
part
of
the
family
pool,
and
the
result
of
it
is
to
reduce
the
total
amount
they
get.
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
you
think
that
depends
as
a
matter
of...
on
state
law
whether
that
program
is
bad
or
not?
justice
stevens
my
bottom
line
question
was,
would
you
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
this
basic
arrangement
if
the
child
support
were
not
a
part
of
it,
if
it
just
applied
to
income
that
the
children
earned?
justice
stevens
even
though
it
might
have
precisely
the
same
economic
consequences?
justice
stevens
well,
i
don't
know
anything
about
state
law.
i'm
just
looking
at
the
economics
and
the
burden
on
these
people
who
have
trouble
making
ends
meet.
it
would
economically
be
precisely
the
same
situation.
why
wouldn't
it
be
precisely
the
same
legal
situation
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
