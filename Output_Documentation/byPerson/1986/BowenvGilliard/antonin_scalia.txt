justice
scalia
well,
it
comes
back
to
the
family...
you
say
it
works
no
hardship;
it
works
no
hardship
on
the
family.
justice
scalia
but
one
of
the
contentions
here
is
that
it
does
work
a
hardship
on
the
child
for
whom
the
support
is
destined.
justice
scalia
and
give
it
to
the
family.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
now
why
is
that
wrong?
justice
scalia
xxx
taking.
let's
not
get
into
the
refinement
of
takings.
is
it...
is
the
substance
of
what
happens
wrong?
under...
can...
can
a
mother
who
receives
afdc
in
theory
distribute
it
among
her
children
anyway
she
wants?
could
she
continue
to
give...
let's
say
she
gets...
she
has
$250
support
payment
for
joey.
could
she
get
$300
from
afdc
and
decide,
i'm
going
to
spend
$200
of
this
on
joey?
justice
scalia
she's
required
to
spend
it
in
the
best
interest
of
all
her
children?
justice
scalia
but
she's
not
giving
$200
to
joey
because
she
thinks
that's
in
the
best
interest
of
all
her
children.
it
assuredly
isn't.
she
wished
she
could
spread
that
among
all
the
children.
but
she
figures
this
$200
is
joey's.
justice
scalia
no,
that's
not
the
reason.
in
fact,
given
her
druthers,
she'd
distribute
it
evenly
among
all
of
them,
as
i
think
any
mother
would.
but
she
figures
she
is
getting
this
$200
from
her
ex-husband
for
joey,
and
that's
been
converted
into
an
afdc
payment;
she
is
going
to
continue
to
spend
$200
on
joey,
even
though
in
her
view
that's
not
in
the
best
interest
of
all
the
children.
would
that
violate
the
afdc
rules?
justice
scalia
it
would
depend
on
what
the
other
children
needed.
so
if
the
other
children
needed
more,
and
she
continued
to
give
$200
to
joey,
that
would
violate
afdc?
justice
scalia
i
know,
but
just
take
my
hypothetical.
that's
not
the
case.
she
gives
the
200
bucks
to
joey.
justice
scalia
it
could?
justice
scalia
it
isn't
clear
that
she
can
do
that
without
violating
the
afdc
law?
justice
scalia
mr.
lauber,
i'll
give
you
an
easier
question
that
i
think
will
make
it
even
clearer.
it
isn't
they
all
three
have
the
same
orthodontic
need.
two
of
them
need
food,
and
she
gets
back
the
money
from
afdc.
could
she
use
it
for
the
orthodontic
purpose
for
which
it
was
originally
contributed
by
the
husband
instead
of
buying
food
for
the
other
two?
justice
scalia
but
they're
not
arguing
that
it's
being
taken
from
the
mother.
it's
being
taken
from
the
child.
it's
not
voluntary
on
the
part
of
the
child.
the
mother
says,
i'm
going
to
chuck
in
your
child
support
in
order
to
get
more
money
for
the
family
as
a
whole.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
very
nice,
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
it's
a
taking
from
the
child
or
not.
justice
scalia
so
you
say...
you
suggest
that
if
the
child
had
a
guardian,
secured
a
guardian
ad
litem,
talked
to
his
or
her
uncle
and
said,
mother
is
giving
away
my
child
support,
let's
sue
her,
do
you
think
they
could
an
injunction
against
her
signing
that?
they
say,
this
is
mine.
my
father
is
giving
it
to
my
mother
for
me,
and
she
is
breaching
her
trust.
justice
scalia
maybe
that
statute
was
a
taking?
justice
scalia
and
you
think
prior
to
that
time
she
was
pretty
careful
to
spend...
how
much
was
it?
justice
scalia
and
she
used
to
spend
that
$189
for
those
two,
and
how
much
did
she
get
from
afdc
for
the
other
three?
justice
scalia
so
they
got
$80
apiece,
and
the
other
ones
got
how
much
apiece?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
she
was
really
careful
to
make
sure
that
the
family's...
the
child
support
money
she
was
getting
from
the
husband
went
to
those
two
children?
is
it
a
real
world
we're
talking
about
when
we're
talking
about
a
mother
who
has,
let's
say,
five
children,
one
of
whom
has
support
money,
spending
that
money...
that
allotment,
on
that
child?
is
that
a
real
world
out
there?
i
mean,
we
have
these
cinderellas
in
reverse,
one
child
of
five,
who
has
a
lot
of
money,
and
the
other
four
don't?
justice
scalia
because
they
were
teenagers;
not
because
that's
where
the
support
money
was...
the
reality
that
congress
was
addressing
in
this
statute
is
a
reality
in
which
a
mother
spends
whatever
money
she
has
for
all
of
the
children
she's
taking
care
of;
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
a
parent
has
been
sued
for
spending
the
money
on
the
wrong
children?
i
mean,
i've
never
even
heard
of
such
a
suit.
justice
scalia
and
you
think
that's
because
everybody
is
really
keeping
close
track
of
how
much
money
they're
spending
on
each
of
their
children?
justice
scalia
they
always
get
back
more
than
the
child
support
that
they're
trading
in;
but
they
don't
get
back
more
than
the
would
have
gotten
had
they
had
the
child
support
plus
their
former
afdc
without
that
child
counted
in?
justice
scalia
isn't
the
logic
of
your
position
not
only
that
the
1984
amendment
is
no
good,
but
that
the
whole...
even
if
a
mother
voluntarily
wants
to
include
a
child
who
is
entitled
to
child
support
in
the
afdc
program,
because,
let's
say,
the
father
is
in
fact
not
paying
it,
and
she'd
rather
have
the
government
try
to
pursue
the
father,
assign
it
to
the
government
and
get
back
afdc
for
it,
even
that
would
be
invalid,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
she's
giving
away
the--
justice
scalia
--oh,
but
she's
not...
when
she
gets
it
back,
she's
not
going
to
just
spend
it
on
that
child,
she's
going
to
have
to
abide
by
the
afdc
regulations,
and
spend
it
on
all
the
children.
but
that
money
should
go
just
to
that
one
child,
shouldn't
it?
and
if
the
government
collects
it,
it
keeps
it.
justice
scalia
so
that
would
be
bad
too,
wouldn't
it?
and
so
would
including
in
the
afdc
the
earnings
of...
well,
the
earnings
of
a
child
that
he
earns
all
on
his
own,
and
he
has
no
obligation
to
support
any
other
children.
justice
scalia
they're
not
counted.
well,
just
take
the
child
support
where
the
mother
wants
to
assign
it
to
the
government;
you
couldn't
do
that?
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see;
one-fifth
of
something
is
better
than
a
hundred
percent
of
nothing.
i
guess
that
would
be
right,
if
she
wasn't
collecting
a
thing.
mr.
wettach,
let
me
ask
you
a
pragmatic
question.
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
north
carolina
where
all
of
this
has
driven
the
more
fortunate
child
out
of
the
home
to
live
elsewhere?
justice
scalia
ms.
wettach,
wouldn't
you
say
that
one
of
the...
one
of
the
benefits
that
a
child
could
receive,
and
one
of
the
purposes
for
which
a
mother
may
use...
or
a
father
may
use
the
child's
support
money
is
to
enable
the
child
to
live
with
brothers
and
sisters?
i
mean,
let's
assume...
let's
assume
a
mother
is
getting
support
money
for
one
child,
and
she
has
a
couple
of
other
children,
she
says,
i
want
this
child
to
be
brought
up
with
his
brothers
and
sisters.
in
order
to
do
that,
rather
than
sending
the
other
children
away
to
the
poor
house
or
somewhere,
i'm
going
to
have
to
spend
some
of
this
support
money
for
them.
wouldn't
you
think
that
that
would
be
considered
spending
that
money
for
the
benefit
of
the
child?
justice
scalia
wouldn't
that
be
every
circumstance
in
which
the
mother
decides
to
trade
in
the
support...
the
support
money
for
afdc
benefits,
which
will
be
slightly
more
than
the
support
money
and
enable
her
to
keep
the
family
together.
can't
that
be
considered
to
be
in
the
benefit
of
the
child
who
was
entitled
to
the
support
money,
even
if
he
doesn't
get
dollar
for
dollar
what
he
used
to?
he's
getting
his
brothers
and
sisters?
justice
scalia
that's
a
different
question,
though.
that's
not
the
takings
question.
that's
the
question
of
whether
there
is
excessive
coercion
on
a
fundamental
right
or
something
of
that
sort.
but
as
to
whether
there
has
been
a
taking
or
not,
can't
you
say
that
indeed
the
mother
has
traded
in
for
value
the
child's
support
money?
she
has
gotten
back
for
it
the
company
of
the
brothers
and
sisters?
justice
scalia
the
family
unit
as
a
whole.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know.
i
just
expect
that
if
i
had
before
me
a
suit
involving
an
allegation
that
support
money
wasn't
being
spent
entirely
for
the
child
for
whom
it
was
destined
by
the
mother,
and
that
she
was
using
some
of
it
to
buy
bare
necessities
for
the
other
children
just
to
keep
the
family
together,
i
doubt
that
i'd
find
that
mother
to
be
in
violation
of
her
trust
obligation.
justice
scalia
xxx
though.
that's
not
the
takings
point.
justice
scalia
i
think
i'm
right
about
that.
that
is
your
separate
point.
justice
scalia
has
this
been
preserved
below,
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
scalia
ms.
wettach,
before
you
leave,
what...
what
would
you
suggest
the
federal
government
have
done
instead?
assuming
that
its
finding
was
correct,
the
legislative
finding,
that
families
use
all
of
the
money
that
they
get
on
all
of
its...
on
all
of
their
members
for
the
best
interests
of
the
whole
family
group,
including
money
from
support
payments.
and
they...
the
federal
government
says,
we
have
to...
we're...
we
have
to
pay
out
less.
we
have
to
reduce
the
amount.
it
makes
sense
to
us
to
reduce
the
amount
to
those
families
that
have
$800
coming
in.
and
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact,
never
mind
that
theoretically
they're
supposed
to
be
spent
on
only
two
of
the
children;
we
know
that
that
family
has
$800
which
is
being
used
for
the
whole
family.
this
other
family
over
here
only
has
$200
that's
being
used
for
the
whole
family.
now,
i
want
the
cut
to
hit
the
family
with
the
$800
and
not
the
family
from
the
$200.
how
could
the
federal
government
have
done
it
lawfully?
justice
scalia
but
you
wouldn't
allow
the
support
payments
to
be
counted
in
at
all?
justice
scalia
but
that's
not
the
reality
that
congress
has
found.
i
don't
care
what
your
chart
is,
if
you
assume
in
theory
that
the
mother
is
spending
the
money
for
the
house
which
other
people
use
and
whatnot.
the
reality
that
congress
perceived
was
that
all
the
money
that
comes
into
the
family
unit
is
distributed
among
all
the
family
members
on
the
basis
of
how
they
need
it,
period.
and
congress
wants
to
take
that
factor
into
account.
you
just
told
me
that
there's
no
way
that
congrss
can
do
that?
