justice
o'connor
mr.
lauber,
tell
us
again,
now
if
a
child
support
payment
has
been
ordered
for
one
of
the
children
in
the
family
and
not
the
others,
in
the
amount
of
let's
say
$200
a
month,
not
all
of
the
$200
a
month
that
must
be
assigned
to
the
state
would
come
back
to
the
family,
would
it?
justice
o'connor
oh,
that
wasn't
my
understanding
at
all.
i
thought
the
$50
came
out
of
the
child
support
payment,
and
was
only
paid
if
the
child
support
payment
were
made.
justice
o'connor
i
thought
the
$50
was
never
given
back
to
the
family
unless
the
parent
ordered
to
pay
the
support
in
fact
paid
the
support?
justice
o'connor
well,
they
get
afdc
benefits.
it
may
not
be
that
$200.
justice
o'connor
and
indeed,
the
amount
of
money
received
by,
or
attributed,
in
afdc
to
the
child
for
whom
the
support
payment
was
made
is
less
than
the
$200.
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
the
child's
pro
rata
share,
it's
substantially
less
than
the
$200
for
whom
the
support
has
been
ordered?
justice
o'connor
and
the
whole
basis
of
the
father's
support
obligation
in
that
example
would
be
his
obligation
to
that
child
that
he
fathered,
is
that
not
so?
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
correct,
that
when
state
courts
order
child
support,
that
they
are
ordering
it
on
the
basis
of
the
father's
obligation
to
the
child
he
fathered?
justice
o'connor
--but
mr.
lauber,
you
could
certainly
have
situations
where
a
local
state
judge
awards
child
support
on
the
theory,
for
example,
that
a
particular
child
needs
orthodontic
treatment,
and
orders
child
support
in
an
amount
to
cover
that.
justice
o'connor
and
the
father
felt
obligated
to
pay
it
for
that
purpose.
now
if
afdc
law
requires
that
all
of
that
be
assigned
to
the
state,
and
it
isn't
all
then
available
for
that
child,
why
shouldn't
the
father
be
able
to
go
back
to
state
court
and
say,
look
what
the
federal
government
has
done,
judge?
now,
reduce
my
child
support,
because
what
i'm
paying
is
going
to
the
family,
not
johnny,
who
needed
the
orthodontic
treatment.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
we
had
examples
in
this
record
where
north
carolina
brought
charges
against
fathers
for
making
some
in-kind
contributions
of
diapers
and
so
forth.
justice
o'connor
well,
there
may
be
individual
examples
where
it
isn't
in
the
child's
best
interest,
though.
justice
o'connor
and
there
certainly
are
examples
in
this
record
where
the
burden
of
this
arrangement
has
been
so
great
that
it
has
caused
families
to
split
up,
and
send
children
to
live
with
someone
else,
so
that
they
can
have
the
benefit
of
that
child's
support.
that's
a
pretty
heavy
burden,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
will
we
have
to
change
that
interpretation
that
the
judge
made
of
north
carolina
law?
justice
o'connor
we
normally
of
course
accept
the
interpretation
of
the
lower
federal
court
on
matters
of
state
law,
don't
we?
justice
o'connor
how
did
the
court
below
deal
with
that
particular
statute?
justice
o'connor
but
you
had
raised
that
with
the
court?
justice
o'connor
you
had
argued
and
presented
to
the
court--
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
mother
believes
that
it
isn't
at
all
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
for
whom
the
support
is
paid
that
her
other
children
are
going
to
starve
to
death
if
she
doesn't
use
that
money?
justice
o'connor
he
didn't
consider
the
state
law
that
says
if
you
assign
the
child
support
to
get
afdc
that
it's
deemed
to
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
child,
did
he?
justice
o'connor
ms.
wettach,
i
suppose
in
your
view
we
would
have
to
make
a
case-by-case
determination
of
how
child
support
payments
were
used
in
each
household
to
know
whether
the
federal
provision
could
be
applied
or
not?
justice
o'connor
ms.
wettach,
have
you
found
examples
of
state
court
judges
who
have
reduced
child
support
orders
because
of
the
impact
of
this
program
on
the
use
of
the
money
for
the
child
for
whom
support
was
originally
ordered?
