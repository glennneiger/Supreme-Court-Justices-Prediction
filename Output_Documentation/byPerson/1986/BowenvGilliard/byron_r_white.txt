justice
white
isn't
under
state
law,
in
this
case,
didn't
the
mother
have
an
obligation
to
spend
the
child
support
only
on
the
one
child.
justice
white
what
if
it
were?
justice
white
to
use
the
child
support
that's
given
her
for
this
child
to
spend
it
on
that
child;
for
the
benefit
of
that
child.
justice
white
all
right--
justice
white
--not
only
permits
it;
it
seems
to
require
it--
justice
white
so
this
case
really
then
turns
on
the
state
law?
justice
white
and
if...
if
we
thought
that...
that
this
payment
belonged
to
the
child,
then
there
must
be
a
taking.
justice
white
all
right.
what
must
there
be,
then?
justice
white
yes?
justice
white
well,
the
child
say,
i'm
involuntary.
i
don't
want
any
part
of
the
program.
i'm
going...
the
law
makes
my
mother
put
me
in,
but
i
don't
want
my
mother
to
do
it.
that's
part
of
the
case.
justice
white
what
do
you
mean
wrong?
how
can...
if
under
the
state
law
it's
his
money,
and
he
doesn't
want
any
part
of
the
program--
justice
white
--all
right.
and
how
about
a
taking?
justice
white
all
right,
so
you
say--
justice
white
--you
say
that
the
remedy
is
the
injunction?
justice
white
the
guardian
ad
litem
didn't
come
along
until
six
months
afterwards.
so
he
gets
an
injunction
but
he
wants
back
pay;
i
mean
he
wants
to
get
the
support
back.
and
it's
a
taking,
there's
been
a
taking.
justice
white
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
what
the
case
is
all
about.
justice
white
there
isn't
any
case
at
all
unless
the
child
has
some
property
under
the
state
law.
justice
white
do
we
have
to
disagree
with
the
district
court's...
or
with
the
court's
construction
of
north
carolina
for
you
to
prevail?
justice
white
what's
the
error...
what's
the
error
in
north
carolina
law
that--
justice
white
--of
the
child?
justice
white
and
your
opposition
will
show
us
just
to
the
contrary.
justice
white
--you
think
that
whatever...
any
property
right
the
child
might
have
had
was
modified
by
that
statute,
or
it
just
couldn't
have
come
about
in
the
face
of
that
statute?
justice
white
which
one
prevails?
i
mean
how
do
you
read
them
together?
justice
white
well,
would
the
mother
be
breaking
the
child
support
law
if
she
received
child
support
and
just
didn't
spend
it
on
the
child?
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
mother
took
the
money
and
spent
it
on
another
child,
all
of
it
on
another
child,
that
she
thought
needed
it
more?
justice
white
but
she...
you
think
if
she
was
receiving
child
support
and
she
wasn't
on
afdc
at
all,
she
just
received
$250
a
month,
and
she
just
split
it
three
ways
among
her
three
children.
justice
white
no,
this
was
child
support
income.
justice
white
and
so
she
can
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
her
children?
justice
white
yes
or
no?
the
answer
is
yes,
i
suppose.
justice
white
what
about
the
north
carolina
law
on
the
right
of
the
child?
that
case
that
you
were
just
talking
about
turns
around
the
right
of
the
child,
i
take
it.
justice
white
is
that--
justice
white
--what
about
that
law?
justice
white
judge
mcmillan
thought
there
was
a
property
right
in
the
child?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
about
the...
is
there
some
other
evidence
besides
the
judge
here
as
to
what--
justice
white
--what
north
carolina
law
is?
justice
white
but
how
do
you
ignore
the
state
statute
permitting
the
mother
to
make
the
assignment?
justice
white
doesn't
that
sort
of
undercut
the
notion
that
the
child
has
his
or
her
own
right
to
the
money?
justice
white
yes,
but
the
state
statute
permits
her
to
do
it,
but
it
doesn't
say
that
when
she
is...
if
she
would
choose,
because
it's
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
not
to
do
it;
but
she
can't
make...
that's
the
problem
with
the
federal
law.
it
deprives
her
of
being
able
to
voluntarily
choose
to
apply
for
afdc
for
that
child,
or
not
apply
for
afdc
for
that
child,
because
the
assignment
provision
would
end
up
not
being
in
the
best
interest.
the
assignment
provision
doesn't
change
anything
about
that...
when
money
is
paid,
it
is
paid
for
the
best
interests
of
a
particular
child.
your
opponent
i
understood
to
argue
differently,
that
the
north
carolina
assignment
law
supersedes,
to
the
extent
it's
inconsistent
with
some
of
the
very
strict
you've
been
reciting.
justice
white
xxx
deal
with
the
assignment
statute?
justice
white
yes,
but
did
he
consider
it
in
the
process
of
determining
whether
the
child
has
a
property
right?
justice
white
but
if
that's
what
the
state
law
says,
doesn't
that
do
something
to
the
child's
property
right?
