justice
jr.
mr.
cooper,
i
agree,
i
think,
with
most
of
what
you
say
about
antitrust
law.
but
tell
me
how
we
got
around
the
jury's
findings
in
this
case?
the
jury
found
the
relevant
sub-market
was
skiing
in
the
area
involving
these
tickets.
as
a
matter
of
general
antitrust
law,
i
would
have
thought
that's
a
perfectly
absurd
finding,
but
the
jury
found
it,
and
ca-10
said
there
was
evidence
to
support
it.
with
all
the
other
mountains
in
that
area,
it
seems
absurd
to
have
a
market
that
narrow.
the
jury
also
found
that
petitioner
had
monopoly
power
in
the
sub-market,
and
ca-10
found
there
was
evidence
to
support
that.
and
finally,
the
jury
found
that
petitioner
willfully
used
its
monopoly
power
to
exclude
the
respondent
from
the
market.
now,
i
take
it,
in
response
to
a
question
from
one
of
the
other
justices,
you
said
your
position
basically
is
that
those
findings
were
contrary
to
the
evidence.
does
that
mean
we
must
review
the
evidence
and
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
contrary
to
the
evidence?
