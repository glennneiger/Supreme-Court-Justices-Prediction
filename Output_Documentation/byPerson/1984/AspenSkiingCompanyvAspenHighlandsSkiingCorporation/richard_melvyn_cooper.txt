mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
whether
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
a
firm
with
monopoly
power
has
a
duty
to
cooperate
with
a
smaller
rival
by
participating
in
a
horizontal
arrangement
for
joint
marketing.
the
question
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
is
shaped
by
two
additional
material
facts.
first,
the
firm
with
monopoly
power
here,
aspen
ski
company,
was
not
vertically
integrated,
but
rather
operated
at
only
one
level
of
the
skiing
industry,
and
therefore
cases
such
as
terminal
railroad,
kodak,
and
otter
tail
are
readily
distinguishable.
this
case
involves
no
vertical
element.
secondly,
the
conduct
at
issue
here,
ski
company's
refusal
to
cooperate
with
aspen
highlands,
was
decided
on
and
carried
out
by
ski
company
independently
and
not
as
part
of
any
group,
contract,
combination,
or
conspiracy,
and
thus,
under
the
distinction
between
independent
action
and
concerted
action
reaffirmed
by
this
court
last
term
in
monsanto
and
in
copperweld,
what
we
have
here
is
clearly
independent
conduct,
not
concerted
conduct.
in
these
circumstances,
we
submit
the
answer
to
the
question
presented
is
no,
that
no
firm,
not
even
one
with
monopoly
power,
has
a
duty
under
the
antitrust
laws
to
engage
in
horizontal
joint
marketing
arrangements.
although
voluntary
horizontal
arrangements
between
competitors
sometimes
have
pro-competitive
aspects
and
are
consistent
with
the
goals
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
therefore
pass
muster
under
section
1's
rule
of
reason,
mandatory
horizontal
arrangements
imposed
by
law
and
enforced
and
administered
by
courts
have
never
had
any
place
in
the
jurisprudence
of
antitrust.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
price-fixing
would
be
per
se
unlawful.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
well,
some
joint
market...
i
said
in
some
circumstances
a
joint
marketing
arrangement
would
be
examined
under
the
rule
of
reason.
broadcast
music
would
be
an
example
of
that.
other
horizontal
arrangements
are
plainly
per
se
bad.
cartels--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--it
does
indeed.
in
the
95
years
since
the
enactment
of
the
sherman
act,
this
court
has
never
held
or
suggested
that
any
duty
of
horizontal
cooperation
exists
or
should
exist,
and
until
the
decision
by
the
tenth
circuit
below
no
court
of
appeals
in
the
95
years
of
the
statute
had
ever
so
held.
thus,
the
decision
below
is
unprecedented,
and
we
submit
is
unwarranted
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
is
indeed
directly
contrary
to
the
central
goals
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
principal
facts
are
relatively
straightforward.
the
product
market
involved
here
is
downhill
skiing
services.
the
jury
found
two
geographic
markets,
one
embracing
all
of
north
america
and
including
all
of
the
firms
that
cater
to
destination
skiers
those
who
travel
a
substantial
distance
to
a
ski
area,
generally
by
airplane,
at
least
in
part,
and
who
spend
a
substantial
amount
of
time,
generally
at
least
a
week.
the
jury
also
found
a
sub-market
consisting
of
the
aspen
area
in
which
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
conduct
their
businesses.
for
a
number
of
years,
each
of
the
two
firms
has
offered
single
day
lift
tickets
and
a
variety
of
multi-day
lift
tickets
designed
to
meet
the
varying
needs
of
different
skiers.
and
if
you
examine
the
exhibits,
exhibit
15
and
47
that
show
the
history
of
the
ticket
offerings
and
prices
of
the
two
firms,
you
will
see
that
there
has
been
considerable
experimentation.
the
specific
kinds
of
tickets
offered
have
varied
from
year
to
year
and
the
pricing
interrelationships
among
the
tickets
have
varied
from
year
to
year.
the
court
below
placed
some
reliance
on
the
fact
that
shortly
before
trial
ski
company
announced
a
prospective
increase
in
its
daily
lift
ticket
price
from
$18
to
$22
per
day.
that
was
a
22
percent
increase.
that's
not
the
largest
one-year
increase
shown
in
the
record
of
this
case.
from
1977-'78
to
'78-'79,
highlands
increased
its
ticket
price
25
percent
in
one
swoop.
also,
the
relationship
between
the
single
day
lift
ticket
and
multi-day
lift
tickets
in
terms
of
price
varied
from
year
to
year.
ski
company's
during
'78-'79,
'79-'80
and
prospectively
for
'81-'82
was
in
the
12.5
to
13.5
percent
range.
highlands
during
these
years
was
approximately
a
35
percent
discount.
so
there
isn't
a
pattern
that
can
be
inferred
from
the
ticket
pricing
or
the
ticket
offerings.
these
firms
were
experimenting
each
year
to
see
what
the
market
reaction
would
be.
for
the
16
years
through
the
1977-'78
season,
with
the
exception
of
one
year,
the
two
firms
together
cooperated
in
offering
a
joint
ticket,
on
which
they
set
the
price
together
and
the
terms
and
conditions.
it
was
good
for
six
days
of
skiing
at
any
of
the
four
mountains
operated
by
the
two
firms.
in
1977-'78,
for
the
first
time
in
several
years
ski
company
offered
a
competing
six-day
ticket
good
at
its
three
mountains.
and
in
'78-'79,
'79-'80,
and
'80-'81,
ski
company
refused
to
continue
the
joint
ticket.
it
also
refused
to
sell
tickets
to
its
horizontal
competitor,
highlands,
and
in
'78-'79
it
refused
to
honor
coupons
issued
by
highlands
for
entry
onto
ski
company's
facilities.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
no,
counsel
did
not.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
we
contend
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
we
do
not
challenge
the
instructions.
on
our
view
of
the
case,
you
would
never
have
reached
the
giving
of
instructions.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
yes.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
i
would
submit
not.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
because
the
premise
on
which
that
evidence
would
go
to
the
jury
is
that
there
is
a
duty
under
section
2
to
engage
in
horizontal
joint
marketing
arrangements
with
a
competitor.
we
submit
as
a
matter
of
law
there
is
no
such
duty
and
therefore
the
refusal
to
accept
the
coupons
issued
by
a
competitor
could
not
support
a
finding
of
a
section
2
violation.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
that's
correct.
it
was
issued
unilaterally
by
highlands
for
access
to
its
own
facilities
and
to
ski
company's
facilities.
and
it's
our
submission
to
the
court
that
no
firm
has
to
accept
that
when
it's
done
by
a
horizontal
competitor.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
even
if
it's
the
same
as
cash,
although
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--in
fact,
when
they
did
that
ski
company
accepted
it.
in
the
latter
two
years--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--they
don't
turn
down
money.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
they
tried
to
buy
some
tickets
from
ski
company.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
i
think
that's
a
fair
inference,
although
it's
not
absolutely
clear
what
price
they
were
offering.
i
read
it
as
the
retail
price.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
that's
correct.
and
its
evident
reason
for
its
refusal
to
do
so
was
that
it
wanted
to
market
its
tickets
its
own
way
and
not
through
highlands.
it
wanted
to
compete
for
those
same
skiers
by
offering
them
its
array
of
tickets.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
that
was
one
of
the
arguments.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
the
duty
to
cooperate
point
was
raised
by
counsel
in
those
very
terms,
and
counsel
cited
the
relevant
cases.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
yes.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
it
does
not
appear
in
the
joint
appendix.
it's
in
the
transcript,
cited
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
let's
analyze
them,
if
we
may.
one
of
them
was
an
allegation
of
a
section
1
conspiracy
between...
that
was
the
fourth
one
alleged,
conspiracy
alleged
between
ski
company
and
a
reservation
service.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
ski
company
on
that
issue,
so
that
one's
gone.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
no,
but
there
was
a
separate
section
2
verdict
and
a
section
1
verdict,
and
that
allegation
related
to
both.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
but
the
jury
held
that
it
was
not
a
section
1
violation.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
i
would
think
so
in
this
case.
i
would
think
we're
entitled
to
all
of
the
fair
inferences
that
would
arise
from
that
verdict.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
i
don't
think
you
have
an
inconsistent
verdict
here.
i
think
the
jury...
it's
fair
to
infer
that
the
jury
simply
did
not
rely
on
the
allegation
of
a
section
1
conspiracy
as
part
of
a
section
2
violation.
the
second
element
of
the
six,
the
third
one
mentioned,
was
the
advertising,
and
our
submission
on
that
is
it's
de
minimus
and
indeed
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
all
of
these
other
four...
the
refusal
to
continue
the
joint
ticket,
the
offering
of
the
competitive
three-area
ticket,
the
refusal
to
accept
the
coupons,
and
the
announcement
of
the
prospective
price
increase,
which
were
the
other
four
elements
cited
by
counsel
in
closing
argument
and
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals...
all
are
subsumable,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
under
the
issue
of
the
duty
to
cooperate.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
it
was
simply
that
they
raised
the
single
ticket
price
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
highlands'
adventure
pack
prospectively
uneconomical.
if
you
ask
yourself,
why
is
it
an
antitrust
violation
for
a
firm,
even
with
monopoly
power,
to
raise
its
price,
which
normally
would
divert--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--well,
that's
the
argument
made
in
it
was
presented...
and
i'll
address
both.
as
it
was
presented
to
the
jury
and
relied
on
by
the
court
of
in
the
one-day
price,
this
22
percent
increase,
and
made
the
adventure
pack
uneconomical.
and
our
submission
is
that
a
firm
in
setting
its
own
prices
does
not
have
to
take
into
account,
as
a
matter
of
law
does
not
have
to
take
into
account,
the
needs
of
a
horizontal
competitor.
normally
when
a
firm
with
monopoly
power
raises
its
price
it
induces
consumers
to
go
to
its
competitors.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
well,
then
you
might
have--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--you
might
have
a
predatory
pricing
question.
you'd
have
to
see
whether
the
price
was
below
some
relevant
cost,
marginal
cost,
average
variable
cost,
average
total
cost,
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
i
would
submit
not.
and
indeed,
on
the
record
here,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
ski
company's
discount
in
the
neighborhood
of
13.3
percent
for
the
prospective
increase...
i'm
sorry,
13.6
percent...
was
way
below
the
discounts
offered
by
highlands
on
its
unilateral
six-day
ticket,
which
in
general
were
35
and
36
percent
in
the
years
in
question.
so
you
don't
have
that
sort
of
problem
here.
and
just
one
more
point
on
the
price
increase.
the
only
reason
why
a
price
increase
would
hurt
a
horizontal
rival
rather
than
help
the
horizontal
rival
is
that
that
horizontal
rival
is
in
some
way
depending
on
the
product
of
the
firm
that
raised
its
price.
now,
we
submit
that
there's
no
duty
to
yield
to
such
claimed
dependence.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
well,
even
in
the
range
we're
talking
about,
the
discount
between
the
single
day
ticket
and
the
six-day
ticket
is
very
small.
it's
a
13-something
percent
discount.
as
a
matter
of
dollars
it's
$18
over
the
six
days
of
skiing.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
right.
but
the
evidence,
even
from
the
plaintiff's
expert
witnesses,
was
that
ticket
price
differences
of
a
few
dollars,
given
the
wealth
of
the
people
who
ski
in
aspen,
is
insignificant,
has
no
substantial
market
effect.
these
people
are
relatively
price
inelastic.
that
was
the
evidence
from
the
witnesses
on
both
sides.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
yes,
that
a
firm
has
no
duty
to
deal
with
a
horizontal
competitor.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
if
all
that
you
have
is
the
refusal,
then
it
wouldn't
matter
what
the
purpose
is.
our
position
is
that
the
purpose
of
every
firm
that
engages
in
competition
is
to
prevail
in
competition,
and
at
the
level
of
intent,
intent
alone,
there's
no
difference
between
a
desire
to,
an
intent
to
prevail
in
competition
and
a
desire
to
defeat
competition.
the
test
between
the
two
comes
at
the
conduct
level.
if
a
firm
seeks
to
prevail
in
competition
through
exclusionary
practices,
then
you
have
a
section
2
violation.
if
it
seeks
to--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--our
submission
is
there
is
not.
there
is
only
two
kinds
of
evidence
that
are
relevant
here:
evidence
of
failure
to
cooperate
and
the
advertising
evidence.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
duty
to
cooperate
and
therefore
evidence
of
failure
to
cooperate
is
in
effect
evidence
of
competition,
not
of
anti-competitive
behavior.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
yes.
again,
under
colgate
and
under
monsanto
a
firm
has
a...
so
long
as
it's
acting
independently,
has
a
right,
an
element
of
economic
freedom
to
decide
with
whom
it
will
deal,
how
it
will
sell
its
products.
instead
of--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--correct.
that
is,
where
you
have
the
refusal
to
deal
combined
with
something
else,
where
it's
combined
with
concerted
action,
if
you
have
the
lorain
journal
kind
of
situation
where
you're
going
to
discriminate
against
consumers
who
patronize
a
rival
and
you
have
monopoly
power,
you
clearly
can't
do
that.
but
that's
not
what's
involved
here.
instead
of
combining
cooperation
with
competition,
we
submit
ski
company
engaged
in
a
strategy
of
competition,
for
which
it
was
held
to
have
violated
section
2
and
it
was
held
liable
for
$7.5
million
of
treble
damages.
we
submit
that
the
conduct
at
issue
here
was
not
exclusionary
under
any
reasonable
definition
of
the
term
"exclusionary".
it
imposed
no
restraint
on
the
ability
of
highlands
to
bring
its
own
product
to
the
market.
highlands
was
free
to
engage
in
whatever
unilateral
conduct
it
chose.
it
could
run
its
ski
operation
and
it
could
sell
its
lift
tickets,
package
them
any
way
it
chose,
unilaterally.
ski
company's
conduct
imposed
no
restraint
on
consumers.
they
remained
free
to
patronize
either
or
both
companies
and
to
divide
their
patronage
between
the
firms
any
way
they
wished.
the
conduct
was
not
predatory.
it
was
capable
of
being
sustained
indefinitely
and
without
subsidy,
and
its
success
did
not
depend
on
destruction
of
highlands,
on
injury
to
highlands,
or
on
inducing
through
discipline
any
changes
in
highlands'
unilateral
conduct.
finally,
the
conduct
at
issue
here
was
not
based
on
monopoly
power.
any
firm
having
facilities
that
it
believes
can
attract
consumers
on
their
own
individual
merits
can
pursue
the
kind
of
competitive
non-cooperative
strategy
that
ski
company
pursued
here.
we
submit
that
ski
company's
refusal
to
cooperate
not
only
did
not
violate
section
2,
but
that
it
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
central
goals
of
the
antitrust
laws.
first,
it
is
consistent
with
the
goal
of
achieving
economic
efficiency
and
consumer
welfare,
and
the
duty
to
cooperate
is
contrary
to
that
interest.
a
duty
to
cooperate
mandated
by
law
is
in
essence
a
subsidy
that
transfers
resources
and
rewards
from
the
more
efficient
firm
that
seeks
to
compete
to
the
less
efficient
firm
that
is
dependent
on
cooperation,
and
it
thereby
injures
the
efficient
use
of
resources
by
the
more
efficient
firm,
with
consequent
injury
to
long-term
consumer
interests.
in
addition,
a
duty
to
cooperate
would
discourage
risk-taking,
innovation,
and
entrepreneurial
activity.
if
a
firm
that
engages
in
risk-taking,
for
example,
has
to
share
with
its
rivals
the
benefits
of
successful
entrepreneurial
activity,
but
must
itself
absorb
on
its
own
the
costs
of
unsuccessful
entrepreneurial
activity,
then
the
law
discourages
such
activity,
to
the
detriment
of
consumers,
of
productivity,
and
of
the
competitiveness
of
american
firms.
second,
a
duty
to
cooperate
is
contrary
to
the
antitrust
goal
of
economic
freedom,
of
autonomous
decisionmaking
by
individual
economic
units.
that
is
a
value
that
has
been
asserted
in
numerous
decisions
of
this
court:
in
topco,
in
city
of
boulder,
in
ncaa,
in
monsanto,
in
copperweld,
in
many
other
decisions.
there
are
very
few
circumstances
where
our
law
grants
to
someone
a
power
to
coerce
someone
else
to
deal
with
them.
we
have
many
negative
prohibitions.
you
shall
not
discriminate
in
various
ways
against
various
classes
of
consumers
or
others.
but
the
notion
that
a
firm
has
a
duty
to
deal
with
another
or
that
the
other
firm
has
a
power
to
coerce
horizontal
dealing
i
submit--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--aspen
ski
corp.
would
not
accept
the
coupons.
it
wanted
to
sell
them
its
own
tickets.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
not
to
get
them
away
from
the
highlands.
they
could
buy
groups
of
tickets
from
each
firm.
the
one
thing
that
ski...
and
ski
at
either
firm's
facilities
as
they
wished.
and
if
i,
for
example,
were
to
open
a
very
small
amusement
park
as
close
as
i
could
get
to
disneyland
and
then
purport
to
issue
a
joint
ticket
entitling
my
consumer
to
go
to
disneyland
and
to
come
to
my
little
one-block
facility
with
a
ferris
wheel,
i
think
it
would
be
understandable
why
disneyland
wouldn't
want
to
accept
my
coupon--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--even
if
they
were
bank-guaranteed.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
ski
company
was
perfectly
willing
to
deal
with
highlands'
customers
by
selling
them
tickets,
which
is
the
normal
way
one
gets
entrance
to
somebody's
facilities.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
we
accepted
money
orders.
there
were
three
years
that
were
involved
with
the
adventure
pack.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
correct.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
i
would
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
that
conduct
was
engaged
in
in
only
one
year,
only
in
the
1978-'79
year.
there
were
four
damage
years
here,
'77-'78
through
'80-'81.
the
only
year
in
which
ski
company
refused
to
accept
coupons
was
1978-'79.
but
i
would
submit--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
well,
in
form
you
have
to
review
the
evidence.
in
substance
the
task
is
much
easier,
because
the
only
evidence,
we
submit,
that
could
possibly
support
the
jury
verdict
that
isn't
de
minimus
is
the
evidence
of
failure
to
cooperate
in
various
ways.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
duty
under
section
2
as
a
matter
of
law
why
that
evidence
should
even
go
to
the
jury,
but
even
taking
that
evidence
as
established
fact,
it
doesn't
amount
to
an
antitrust
violation;
that
there
is
no
duty
to
accept
your
competitor's
coupons
for
entry
into
your
own
facilities;
that
there's
no
duty
to
have
a
joint
ticket
with
your
competitor;
and
that
there's
no
duty
to
sell
your
tickets
to
your
competitors
so
that
he
can
package
them
with
his
own
tickets
to
get
tag-along
purchases
of
his
own
tickets.
and
if
the
court
launches
on
a
new
duty
to
cooperate,
if
it
establishes
that
in
antitrust
law,
we
submit
the
consequences
would
be
very
deleterious.
it
would
create
great
uncertainty,
for
firms
would
not
know
when
they
had
a
duty
to
compete
and
when
they
had
a
duty
to
cooperate.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
i
think
the
case
could
have
been--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--that's
correct.
i
don't
know
that
i'd
phrase
it
as
admissibility.
i
think
the
case
could
have
been
decided
on
the
pleadings.
there
could
have
been
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
no,
i
didn't
try
the
case,
no.
it
wasn't
done.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
there
was
not
a
motion.
but
we
can
still
raise
it
at
the
trial.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
yes,
there
was.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
yes,
it
was.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
but
the
appropriate
time
to
make...
one
appropriate
and
sufficient
time
to
make
that
argument
is
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
evidence,
when
you
can
argue
that
you're
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict,
and
that
argument
was
made.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
i
would
submit
not.
again,
you
look
at
the
conduct.
if
the
conduct
is
merely
competition,
then
it's
permissible
under
the
antitrust
laws.
if
i
want
to
drive
my--
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
--the
jury
was
told...
we
accepted
the
instructions.
the
jury
was
told
that
it
didn't
have
to
find
specific
anti-competitive
intent.
that
instruction
was
correct.
that's
been
the
law
for
decades.
mr.
richard
melvyn
cooper
well,
the
instruction
was
in
terms
of
grinnell.
it
had
to
find
willful
acquisition
or
maintenance.
maybe
the
jury
understood
that
better
than
antitrust
practitioners
do.
but
it
didn't...
the
jury
did
not
have
to
find
specific
intent,
and
i
would
submit
that
if
i
want
to
drive
my
competitor
out
of
business,
i
want
to
destroy
him
and
hurt
him,
but
the
way
i
want
to
do
it
is
by
making
a
better
product
and
selling
at
a
profit
maximizing
price,
i've
committed
no
antitrust
violation.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left.
