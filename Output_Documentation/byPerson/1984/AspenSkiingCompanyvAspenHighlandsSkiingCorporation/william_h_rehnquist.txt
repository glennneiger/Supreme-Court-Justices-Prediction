justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
lift
tickets
had
freely
been
made
available
say
in
drug
stores
and
grocery
stores
in
the
village.
could
they
still
have,
with
the
same
impunity,
have
denied
them
to
highlands?
justice
rehnquist
--this
was
a
colloquy
on
jury
instructions?
justice
rehnquist
that
isn't,
of
course,
the
basis
on
which
the
tenth
circuit--
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
trautman,
forgive
me.
let
me
interrupt
you
just
a
moment
to
get
back
to
the
earlier
point
about
the
directed
verdict
argument.
justice
rehnquist
i
was
just
looking
at
14(a)
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
is
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
and
it
says
there,
the
court
of
appeals
says:
"defendant
moved
for
a
directed
verdict
on
two
occasions.
"
"each
time
it
urged
that
there
was
no
duty
to
cooperate.
"
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
say
that
this
preserved
defendant's
opportunity
to
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
that
issue.
justice
rehnquist
so
you're
really
asking,
if
you
ask
us
to
affirm
on
the
basis
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
argument
as
part
of
a
motion
for
directed
verdict,
you're
asking
us
to
take
a
different
view
of
the
sufficiency
of
that
motion
than
the
court
of
appeals
took.
