mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
decided
by
the
jury
originally
and
affirmed
by
the
tenth
circuit,
does
not
create
a
duty
to
cooperate.
instead,
the
issue
that
you
find
yourselves
having
to
decide
here
is
to
review
the
jury's
findings.
that
is,
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence,
including
all
of
the
conduct
that
was
presented
at
trial,
to
find
that
petitioner's
conduct,
including
its
refusals
to
deal
and
its
other
actions
that
are
noted,
constituted
monopolization.
that
was
the
issue.
two
points
i'd
like
to
make
in
this
argument:
one,
because
of
the
lack
of
evidence
below
justifying
its
refusals,
plaintiff
seeks
a
new
per
se
rule
of
free
license
for
monopolists
in
this
court.
it
has
to
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
justify
its
refusals
below.
secondly,
reviewing
the
evidence
under
the
established
rule,
which
i
will
mention
in
a
moment,
there
clearly
was
sufficient
evidence
for
the
jury
to
find,
in
taking
all
of
the
conduct
as
a
whole,
that
this
conduct
was
exclusionary,
this
conduct
was
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now
let
me
tell
you
just
a
little
bit
about
how
this
case
was
tried,
because
as
you
know--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--sure.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
the
theory
of
monopolization--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--yes.
the
theory
of
monopolization
is
i
think
as
this
court
has
stated
it
in
grinnell,
and
that
is
that
it
condemns
conduct
which
maintains
or
extends
a
monopolist's
power,
but
it
does
not
condemn
conduct
which
is
the
result
of
a
superior
product,
business
acumen,
or
historic
accident.
that
in
a
nutshell
is
the
rule
that
this
case
was
tried
under.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
rule
was
submitted
as
the
instruction
in
this
case
by
trial
counsel
for
petitioner,
and
trial
counsel
for
petitioner
further
set
forth
in
the
instructions
that
were
proposed
to
this
trial
judge
that
competitors
do
not
have
a
duty
to
cooperate.
he
went
on
to
say
that
they
may
refuse
to
deal,
provided
they
have
a
valid
business
justification.
that's
the
basis,
that's
the
rule
of
law,
that
this
case
was
tried
under,
and
that's
been
the
law
in
this
country
since
1927,
when
this
court
decided
eastman
kodak.
and
in
that
rule
essentially
we
set
up
a
standard
for
monopolists
which
subjects
their
refusal
to
deal
to
scrutiny,
and
that
particular
rule
makes
some
economic
sense.
whereas
in
a
competitive
market
firms
in
those
situations
are
disciplined
by
the
market
if
they
refuse
to
deal...
after
all,
consumers
can
turn
to
other
suppliers
of
the
product...
not
so
in
the
situation
where
a
firm
has
monopoly
power,
and
especially
in
a
market
such
as
this,
where
there
are
only
two
firms,
one
with
over
80
percent
of
the
market
and
the
other
with
the
balance.
a
refusal
to
deal
in
that
circumstance
is
not
disciplined
automatically
as
it
is
in
a
competitive
market.
thus
the
rule
as
set
forth
in
the
jury
instructions
which
the
trial
judge
accepted
from
the
petitioner
essentially
sets
forth
how
this
case
was
tried.
and
as
it
was
tried,
both
sides
put
on
evidence.
trial
counsel
for
petitioner
put
on
numerous
business
justifications
to
try
to
show
that
its
conduct
was
justified,
including
its
so-called
free
rider
argument
that
it's
resurrected
on
appeal
and
still
belabored
in
the
petitioner's
briefs.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
yes.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
let
me
just
mention
briefly,
that
issue
came
up
when
petitioner
filed
its
brief
in
that
case.
we
had
never
tried
this
case
on
essential
facilities.
we
tried
it
as
a
traditional--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--it's
our
position
that
that
was
a
proper
analogy
for
the
court
to
use
in
analyzing
the
case,
that
specifically
in
this
case
there
was
vertical
conduct,
as
i
will
get
to.
a
refusal
to
sell
tickets
is
vertical
conduct.
we
had
the
ski
company
providing--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--well,
the
facility--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--"facility"
is
probably
a
poor
choice
of
words
by
the
commentators
that
have
set
it
up.
i
think
all
that
that
doctrine
has
tried
to
do
is
to
establish
when
there
is
an
important
item
in
the
market
that
competitors
cannot
do
without
and
successfully
compete,
that
that
is
an
essential
component
of
competition.
in
this
particular
case,
we--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--we
think
that
the
ability
to
be
involved
in
a
multi-mountain,
convenient
multi-mountain
package
of
skiing
in
a
multi-mountain
resort
like
aspen
is
crucial.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
the
components
of
that
ticket
are
the
facility.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
well,
it
seems
to
us,
your
honor,
that
there
are
cases
where...
for
example,
associated
press
is
one
i
can
think
of,
where
newspapers
that
were
excluded
from
associated
press,
wanted
to
take
associated
press
news,
package
it
with
the
news
that
they
had
gathered
and
sell
their
newspapers.
and
we
think
that
that's
an
analogy.
we
think
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
monopolist
can
leverage
in
a
one-market
situation.
you
don't
have
to
have
two
markets,
as
the
rigid
essential
facilities
test
sets
up.
lorain
journal
is
a
good
example.
this
case
is
lorain
journal
because
we
have
a
situation
where
the
monopolist,
a
dominant
monopolist,
attempted
to
use
his
power
to
increase
that
power
in
a
single
market.
and
this
court
when
it
decided
that
case
in
1951
did
not
make
any
fine
distinctions
between
different
levels
of
distribution
or
different
products.
they
were
talking--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--we
sure
didn't,
your
honor.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that
is
exactly
our
position,
your
honor.
it
is
not
necessary
to
affirm
based
on
the
essential
facilities
doctrine,
and
the
case
wasn't
tried
on
that
basis.
let
me
just
mention...
finish
up,
if
i
may,
on
how
the
case
was
tried,
because
after
all
of
the
business
justifications
were
put
on
by
petitioner,
they
came
to
their
motion
for
directed
verdict.
and
in
their
motion
for
directed
verdict,
their
counsel
argued
vigorously
on
the
market
power
issue
and
the
relevant
market
issue
which
justice
powell
mentioned.
they
argued
vigorously,
it
was
a
close
question,
the
court
allowed
it
to
go
to
the
jury,
and
we
prevailed
on
that
issue.
but
they
did
not
mention
the
issue
of
monopolization.
and
we
apologize
for
not
putting
the
actual
pages
out
of
the
transcript
in
so
that
you
could
conveniently
see
it,
but
we
ask
you
to
look
at
page
1452
of
the
transcript,
and
i
think
that
it's
utterly
clear
that
what
was
happening
when
the
counsel
happened
to
mention
duty
to
cooperate
is
that
it
was
part
and
parcel
of
his
relevant
market
argument.
the
court
had
interrupted
and
said,
"we
think
the
evidence,
as
far
as
i
can
see.
"
she
said,
"i
think
the
evidence
showed
that
there
was
no
competition
to
get
skiers
to
aspen,
that
the
competition
really
began
after
they
got
there.
"
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
this
was
a
colloquy
in
the
directed
verdict
motion,
your
honor.
and
in
that
colloquy,
counsel
was
responding,
because
some
of
the
evidence
was,
in
terms
of
how
the
advertisements
went,
there
was
cooperation
in
advertising.
and
counsel
was
arguing
that
that's
not
relevant
to
determining
the
market.
and
then,
in
the
context
of
that...
and
i'll
give
you
the
entire
quote
because
i
think
it's
important.
it
is
a
narrow
issue
that
this
case
can
be
affirmed
on.
in
the
context
of
that
argument,
counsel
said:
"now,
we
also
think,
judge,
that
there
clearly
cannot
be
a
requirement
of
cooperation
between
competitors.
"
"you've
indicated
that
in
your
view
these
two
companies
do
not
compete
with
one
another.
"
"we
think
that's
incorrect.
"
"the
advertising.
"
--and
then
he's
cut
off.
and
she
comes
back
and
reiterates
her
point.
and
he
comes
and
says
advertising's
irrelevant
to
the
relevant
market
issue.
quite
clearly,
the
mere
mention
of
the
right
word...
that
is,
50,
and
we
think
on
that
basis
alone
that
the
tenth
circuit
should
have
affirmed
and
we
think
you
can
affirm
on
that
basis.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that
is
not
the
basis,
and
we
don't
think
that
it
expands
anything
that
we
received
by
the
tenth
circuit.
so
we
believe
this
court
can
certainly
address
it.
let
me
review,
if
i
may,
a
couple
of
points
of
evidence
which
i
think
are
crucial.
mr.
cooper
has
made
much
in
his
brief
and
his
oral
argument
about
how
this
case
creates
mandatory
joint
marketing.
well,
there's
more
to
this
case
than
mandatory
joint
marketing.
obviously,
when
you're
reviewing
the
jury
verdict
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
evidence
together
and
you
have
to
see
the
whole
picture
that
the
jury
saw.
and
this
case
involved
more
than
just
dropping
out
of
a
four-area
arrangement
that
had
existed
for
16
years.
it
involved
conduct,
very
targeted
conduct,
refusing
to
allow
highlands
to
market
a
package
to
provide
four-area
skiing.
and
we
think
that
that's
crucial,
because
that
element
involves
no
price-fixing
dangers.
it
involves
none
of
these
things
that
are
being
argued
here
that
go
against
the
antitrust
laws.
all
we
were
asking
to
do,
as
tour
operators
were
allowed
to
do,
is
to
buy
tickets,
to
come
up
to
the
window
and
pay
full
retail
price.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
yes.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
okay.
let
me
tell
you
about
the
second
occasion.
i've
told
you
about
the
first
occasion.
the
first
occasion
was
in
the
midst
of
the
relevant
market
argument.
the
second
occasion
was
after
all
of
the
evidence
was
finished,
and
what
counsel
said
is
that
we
incorporate
our
previous
arguments.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that's
right.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that's
correct.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
we
contend
that
the
law
in
terms
of
a
monopolist
is
that
you
can
refuse
to
deal,
that
is
you
can
refuse
to
cooperate,
if
you
have
a
legitimate
business
reason.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
everybody
agrees
with
the
general
proposition
there
is
no
general
duty
to
cooperate.
but
a
monopolist,
unlike
a
firm
without
monopoly
power,
when
it
does
refuse,
because
that
is
conduct
which
is
not
economically
rational
at
first
blush,
has
to
justify
it.
and
that's
all
the
law
requires.
in
this
particular
case,
the
reason
we
think
the
jury
rejected
the
justifications
presented
and
the
reason
the
court
let
it
go
to
the
jury
is
that
we
had
targeted
conduct.
we
had
situations
where,
when
we
asked
to
buy
tickets
in
the
first
year,
1977...
our
first
response
was,
sell
us
tickets
like
you
do
to
tour
operators,
we'll
package
the
ticket
ourselves,
we'll
promote
the
ticket
ourselves...
they
said
no.
there
was
no
question
of
price
or
terms
or
how
we
were
going
to
do
it.
they
said
absolutely
not.
that's
on
page
34
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
no.
there
is
no
evidence.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that.
and
i
agree
with
mr.
cooper;
i
think
the
fair
inference
is
that
the
request
was,
would
you
pre-sell
us
tickets,
and
the
answer
was
no,
and
there
was
never
any
further
discussion
because
there
was
no
point
to
it.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
no.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
but
you
see,
the
point,
what
highlands
wanted
to
do
was
essentially
to
buy
a
three-day
ticket,
which
they
sold
in
advance
to
tour
operators,
a
three-area
three-day
ticket
or
a
three-area
four-day
ticket,
and
package
that
with
their
ticket
and
create
a
four-mountain
ticket,
which
had
been
demanded
over
the
last
16
years.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
not
daily
tickets.
but
that's
not
the
full
array
of
tickets
that
were
available
and
that's
not
the
type
of
tickets
that
were
sold
to
tour
operators.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that's
correct.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
we
have
an
injunction
which
exists
now
only
because
the
petitioner
wanted
it
to
exist
for
another
year
while
this
case
was
appealed.
that--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--particular
injunction
is
going
to
run
out.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
no.
no,
we
don't
think
that.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
as
part
of
our
claim,
taken
with
all
of
the
other
conduct.
we
think
that
was
the
precis
to
what
occurred
thereafter,
and
what
occurred
thereafter
is,
when
they
said
to
us,
we
don't
want
anything
to
do
with
you,
we're
not
going
to
sell
this
joint
ticket
any
more,
we
said:
all
right,
we'll
independently
market
our
ticket;
sell
us
tickets.
now,
the
sales
of
tickets
that
we
were
asking
for
took
place
during
the
entire
damage
period.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
no,
the
reason
the
court
did
it,
your
honor,
i
think
quite
clearly
is
that
it
was
a
model
that
was
being
used
by
petitioner
itself
in
another
county
in
colorado,
in
summit
county,
colorado.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
we
asked
for
an
injunction,
your
honor.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
we
tried
at
trial
to
put
on
evidence
of
damages--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that's
correct.
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
evidence
shows
in
terms
of
the
sales
of
these
tickets
that
they
were
targeted,
because
testimony
by
the
financial
vice
president,
statements
were,
the
reason
we're
not
selling
you
these
tickets...
and
i
think
mr.
cooper
has
essentially
admitted
this...
is
because
you're
our
competition,
whereas
they
would
sell
tickets
to
tour
operators,
which
the
evidence
showed
were
also
competitors,
because
what
do
tour
operators
do?
they
do
the
exact
same
thing
that
highlands
wanted
to
do.
they
purchase
tickets,
package
them,
and
resell
them.
and
they
try
to
get
people
to
come
to
aspen,
and
that's
what
highlands
wanted
to
do.
but
highlands
was
singled
out
over
others
because
highlands
was
also
a
competitor
in
terms
of
supplying
services.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
the
colorado
attorney
general
filed
a
lawsuit
alleging
that
there
was
price-fixing.
the
lawsuit
terminated
with
a
consent
decree
and
the
consent
decree
very
specifically
said
the
four-area
ticket
may
continue.
now,
the
coupons
were
the
second
flat
refusal
to
deal.
after
we
couldn't
buy
tickets
to
put
together
the
package,
the
next
thing
we
thought
of
was,
well,
let's
use
the
coupons,
which
are
used,
again,
in
summit
county
they
were
used
in
aspen
for
16
years,
a
recognized
medium
of
exchange
in
the
ski
business.
we'll
go
down
to
the
bank,
we'll
deposit
money
so
that
they
won't
have
any
problem
in
the
redemption
process.
and
again,
a
flat
refusal.
now,
both
of
these
refusals
again
were
targeted,
because
they
accepted
coupons
from
other
competitors
and
their
customers.
we
think
that
this
type
of
conduct,
where
the
consumer
would
show
up
at
the
window
with
a
highlands
ticket,
a
highlands
coupon,
and
say
please
exchange
it,
and
they'll
say,
no,
we
won't
accept
your
medium
of
exchange,
that
they
were
telling
the
consumers
the
same
thing
that
lorain
journal
was
telling
consumers.
that
is,
if
you
deal
with
us
exclusively
things
will
be
fine,
but
if
you
don't
we're
going
to
make
it
difficult
for
you.
and
that's
why
we
believe
that
this
case
is
lorain
journal.
it
falls
into
traditional
exclusionary
antitrust
precedent
by
this
court,
which
focuses
on
conduct.
and
again,
the
reason
why
the
acceptance
of
coupons
from
competitors
in
other
markets
and
the
sales
of
tickets
to
competitors
and
skiers
but
the
refusal
to
do
the
same
thing
to
highlands,
that's
important,
because
what
that
does
is
it
disproves
all
of
their
justifications.
how
could
they
possibly
have
free
rider
problems
with
highlands,
but
not
have
them
with
tour
operators?
highlands
wanted
to
do
the
same
thing.
how
could
they
possibly
have
free
rider
problems
with
coupons
when
they
didn't
have
free
rider
problems
in
summit
county
with
coupons?
so
we
think
that
that
contrary
conduct
in
similar
situations
exposes
those
refusals
to
deal
as
ones
that
create
no
economic
detriment
to
the
incentives
to
invest
in
this
particular
company,
as
hypothetically
surmised
by
mr.
cooper.
and
we
think
also
that
it
reveals
that
it
was
targeted
conduct,
trying
to
prevent
highlands
from
competing
with
its
package.
let
me
just
mention
the
competitive
effect
and
what
the
evidence
was
on
that
issue.
highlands
invested
in
and
helped
develop
this
four-area
joint
venture,
this
four-area
ticket.
it
had
been
in
existence
since
1962,
for
about
16
years.
and
in
1973
highlands
brought
an
innovation,
creating
aspen
reservations,
inc.,
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief.
and
with
that
innovation
came
another
innovation,
which
was
the
around
the
neck
format,
and
the
around
the
neck
format
is
really
what
made
this
venture
take
off,
which
made
this
distribution
system
superior
to
the
daily
lift
tickets,
because
now,
instead
of
having
to
go
back
to
the
ticket
window
and
stand
in
line
every
day,
they
could
go
right
into
the
lift
and
go
up
the
mountain.
they
could
choose
any
one
of
the
four
areas
on
any
given
day.
that
particular
distribution
system,
the
four-area
ticket,
became
the
state
of
the
art
way
of
gaining
access
in
multi-mountain
resorts.
it
coupled
convenience
with
variety,
two
things
that
skiers
when
they
came
to
such
resorts
wanted.
in
every
other
market
that
ski
company
operated
in,
it
participated
in
these
arrangements.
in
aspen,
after
it
kicked
highlands
out
of
the
four-area
ticket,
it
didn't
return
to
just
offering
daily
tickets;
it
returned
to
a
very
similar
type
system
which
combined
convenience
with
variety.
in
short,
the
strong
demand
for
this
ticket,
this
type
of
an
arrangement,
made
access
to
it
crucial
for
a
competitor
such
as
highlands.
and
it's
not
a
situation
where
we
are,
if
you
will,
on
the
coattails
of
ski
company's
enterprise.
this
was
partially
our
enterprise
as
well.
this
enterprise
was
one
that
we
invested
in
with
advertising
dollars
and
that
we
helped
out
with
some
of
our
innovative
ideas.
the
refusal
then
of
ski
company
to
allow
us
to
market
our
own
substitute
product
by
refusing
to
sell
tickets
to
us
or
accept
coupons
had
two
fundamental
adverse
impacts
on
the
competitive
process.
in
the
short
run,
consumers
were
deprived
of
a
product
that
they
wanted,
that
they
clearly
had
demanded,
that
they
had
voted
on
clearly
and
shown
to
be
the
preferred
type
of
ticket.
and
in
the
long
run
highlands
was
slowly
being
driven
from
the
market.
the
evidence
showed...
and
we
ask
you
to
look
at
exhibit
97,
which
shows
that
highlands
was
falling
in
terms
of
its
skier
visits,
despite
the
fact
that
the
evidence
showed
that
it
was
a
quality
mountain,
a
quality
product,
and
was
efficient.
in
conclusion,
let
me
just
state
that
an
affirmance
in
this
case
will
not
create
a
duty
to
cooperate.
as
i
have
argued
and
pointed
out,
instead
well-established
section
2
precedent
will
be
continued
which
permits
refusals
to
deal
by
monopolists
provided
that
they
are
supported
by
efficiencies
or
other
business
justifications.
in
this
case
you
have
a
jury
verdict,
where
quite
clearly
there
was
strong
evidence
that
there
were
no
efficiency
or
other
justifications
to
support
these
targeted
refusals.
by
contrast,
a
reversal
of
this
case,
in
light
of
the
record
below,
will
result
in
a
freeing
of
a
monopolist
to
completely
refuse
to
deal
without
any
justification,
even
though
there's
a
demonstrable
showing
of
damage
to
the
competitive
process,
even
though
innovation
will
be
retarded,
even
though
there
will
only
be
one
competitor
in
the
market
potentially,
that
is
aspen
ski
company.
and
we
think
that
the
antitrust
laws
mean
more
than
just
a
call
for
trader
sovereignty.
there
are
other
interests
that
must
be
protected.
thank
you.
