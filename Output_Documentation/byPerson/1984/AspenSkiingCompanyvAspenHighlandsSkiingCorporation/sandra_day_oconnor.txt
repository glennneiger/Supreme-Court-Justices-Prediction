justice
o'connor
mr.
cooper,
did
counsel
for
petitioner
object
to
the
instructions
given
by
the
court
that
appear
on
pages
181
and
182
of
the
joint
appendix
relating
to
the
section
2
claim?
justice
o'connor
did
not,
okay.
and
do
you
contend
now
that
the
instruction
was
somehow
wrong
or
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient?
justice
o'connor
was
there
some
evidence
that
aspen
ski
company
refused
to
accept
the
adventure
pack
coupons
that
were
equivalent
to
cash
simply
because
they
were
issued
by
a
competitor?
justice
o'connor
and
would
that
be
enough
evidence,
then,
to
get
to
the
jury
on
the
section
2
issue?
justice
o'connor
why
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
had
thought
the
adventure
pack
coupon
proposal
was
different
from
the
joint
ticket,
that
it
was
a
substitute
offered
by
highlights;
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
regardless
of
intent?
justice
o'connor
mr.
cooper,
to
go
back
just
a
moment,
is
it
your
position
that
the
petitioner
could
refuse
to
sell
to
the
highlands
corporation
lift
tickets
for
cash?
justice
o'connor
even
if
the
refusal
were
for
the
purpose
of
harming
your
competitor?
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
the
inquiry,
whether
there
isn't
some
evidence
here
that
would
support
the
section
2
violation.
justice
o'connor
well,
even
if
you're
right
on
that
issue,
then
where
does
that
leave
you
on
the
section
2
issue?
was
there
evidence
that
aspen
ski
company
refused
to
honor
the
coupons
as
presented
by
customers,
by
people,
actual
skiers
who
had
bought
the
coupon
from
the
highlands
and
then
would
present
them
to
aspen
ski
corp.
and
aspen
ski
corp.
would
deny
them?
justice
o'connor
and
no
evidence
that
that
conduct
had
the
effect
of
coercing
unfairly
the
customers,
to
get
them
away
from
the
highlands?
justice
o'connor
--okay.
justice
o'connor
mr.
trautman--
justice
o'connor
--i
take
it
you
support
the
court
of
appeals'
theory
on
the
essential
facilities
doctrine?
justice
o'connor
do
you
defend
that--
justice
o'connor
--what
was
the
facility--
justice
o'connor
--to
which
highlands
was
denied
access?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it's
the
joint
lift
ticket
or
something?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
joint
lift
ticket,
in
other
words,
you
think
is
the
facility?
justice
o'connor
are
there
any
other
cases
that
you
know
of
involving
the
so-called
essential
facilities
concept
where
the
court
has
held
that
a
monopolist
has
to
provide
access
to
the
final
product
to
the
competitor?
