justice
white
well,
the
joint
marketing
arrangement
would
involve
price-fixing,
too,
i
suppose?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
isn't
that
part
of
the
kind
of
a
joint
marketing
arrangement
you're
talking
about?
justice
white
but
this
joint
marketing
arrangement
involved
here
does
involve
an
agreement
on
prices?
justice
white
although
it's
the
same
as
cash?
justice
white
so
highlands
could
just
as
well
have
given
their
people
the
money
and
sent
them
over
there.
justice
white
well,
good,
good.
[laughter]
justice
white
mr.
cooper,
what
if
we
agreed
with
you
that
none
of
this
evidence
really
ought
to
have
been
used
to
prove
monopolization
except,
except
your
refusal
to
accept
coupons
and
money
orders?
justice
white
all
right.
well
then,
your
refusal
to
accept
coupons.
justice
white
what
if
we
thought
that
that
evidence
was
quite
relevant
to
prove
monopolization,
but
all
of
the
other
things
that
you're
objecting
to...
your
refusal
to
issue
a
joint
ticket,
that
you
had
no
duty
to
do
that...
would
that
require
a
new
trial?
justice
white
well,
of
course
you...
i
suppose
continuously
you
refused
to
issue
the
joint
ticket.
justice
white
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
really
saying
that
all
of
this
evidence
was
just
not
admissible
to
prove
monopolization.
justice
white
that
you
can
do
all
of
these
things
and
still
not
monopolize.
justice
white
did
you
try
it?
did
you
do
that?
did
you
move?
justice
white
so
there
wasn't
any
motion,
was
there?
justice
white
was
there
a
motion
for
directed
verdict?
justice
white
and
was
this
kind
of
an
argument
made?
justice
white
but
you
never
did
object
when
they
presented
this
evidence?
you
never
objected
to
the
evidence
as
irrelevant,
or
you
didn't
make
this
kind
of
an
argument,
that
this
evidence
should
never
go
to
the
jury
because
the
antitrust
law
just
doesn't
impose
this
kind
of
a
duty?
justice
white
could
i
just
ask--
justice
white
--just
in
brief,
so
that
i
can
listen
to
you
better,
what
is
your
theory
of
monopolization?
justice
white
can
you
state
what
monopolization
is
just
briefly?
justice
white
mr.
cooper,
i
understand
that
their
refusing
to
honor
your
coupons
and
things
like
that
wouldn't
have
involved
price-fixing
at
all,
but
the
joint
ticket,
the
joint
ticket
does
involve
fixing
the
same
price
for
the
two
areas.
justice
white
and
you
now
have
an
injunction
requiring
this
monopolist
to
price-fix
with
highlands.
justice
white
well,
nevertheless--
justice
white
--nevertheless,
you
have
that
injunction.
you
have
that
injunction,
and
you
say
everybody
agrees
that
you
don't
have
a
duty
to
cooperate.
but
you
must
apparently
think
that
there
is
a
duty
of
the
monopolist
to
price-fix
with
your
client.
justice
white
well,
you
say
that
part
of
your
claim
is
that
the
monopolist
refused
to
sell
a
joint
ticket.
justice
white
you
mean
the
court
in
entering
the
injunction
just
thought
it
up
on
its
own,
or
did
you
ask
for
it?
justice
white
yes,
but
you
must
have
asked
for
it.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
you
asked
for
an
injunction
to
make
aspen
ski
corporation
cooperate
in
the
joint
ticket.
justice
white
which
involved
a
price
fix.
justice
white
well,
didn't
the
colorado
attorney
general
think
that
this
joint
ticket
was
a
price
fix,
illegal
price
fix?
