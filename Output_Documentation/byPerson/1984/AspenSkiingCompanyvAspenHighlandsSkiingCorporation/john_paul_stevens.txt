justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
cooper,
because
you
rely
on
the
motion
for
directed
verdict,
i
guess,
as
the
basis
for
the
error--
justice
stevens
--and
i
notice
right
in
front
of
the
instructions
the
argument
that's
quoted
in
the
joint
appendix,
at
least,
was
that
the
relevant
market
was
incorrectly
defined.
that
was
one
of
the
arguments
made.
justice
stevens
and
did
you
make
another
argument
in
support
of
it?
did
you
argue
this
duty
to
cooperate
point?
justice
stevens
in
support
of
the
motion
for
directed
verdict?
justice
stevens
because
it
doesn't
appear
in
this
part
of
the
joint
appendix.
justice
stevens
i
see.
and
is
it
your
position
that...
and
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
they
said
there
were
six
different
factual
claims
that
added
up
to
exclusionary
conduct.
is
it
your
position
that
each
of
those
six
things
was
rebutted
by
your
argument,
no
duty
to
cooperate?
some
of
them
don't
seem
to
me
to
quite
fit
that.
justice
stevens
were
there
separate
verdicts
on
each
of
the
six,
is
that
what
it
was?
justice
stevens
but
i
thought
the
argument
on
that
was
that
the
exclusive
contract
with
the
tour
operator
was
one
form
of
exclusionary
conduct.
justice
stevens
but
does
that
necessarily
foreclose
the
possibility
that
they
relied
on
that
evidence
as
evidence
of
exclusionary
conduct?
justice
stevens
you
know,
we
have
inconsistent
verdicts
in
the
criminal
law.
you
don't
think
we
could
have
them
in
the
civil
law?
justice
stevens
why
would
this
last
one
be?
the
last
one,
as
i
understood
it,
was
they
raised
the
single
ticket
price
without
raising
the
joint
ticket
price.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
have
the
facts
right.
i
thought
there
was
the
charge
that
you
raised
the
single
ticket
price
dramatically
while
maintaining
the
six-day
coupon
at
the
existing
level.
justice
stevens
well,
but
supposing
you
did
the
opposite
and
left
the
single
ticket
price
alone
and
dropped
the
six-day
coupon,
cut
it
in
half,
and
said,
if
you
don't
go
anyplace
else
during
these
six
days
you
can
get
a
real
cheap
rate
at
our
three
mountains.
justice
stevens
could
that
possibly
create
a
problem?
justice
stevens
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
a
discount
in
order
to
induce
people
just
to
patronize
your
own
business
wouldn't
be
enough,
you'd
say?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
price...
a
dramatic
price
increase
on
a
single
ticket
would
tend
to
motivate
consumers
to
buy
the
six-day
ticket,
and
once
you've
motivated
them
to
buy
the
six-day
ticket
they're
not
going
to
ski
anyplace
else.
justice
stevens
well,
whatever
it
is,
you
raised
the
single
ticket
more
than
you
raised
the
six
day.
justice
stevens
it
surely
couldn't
say,
we
won't
sell
tickets
to
you
if
you
ever
buy
any
tickets
from
the
highlands.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
hypothetical
question.
assuming
you're
right
on
the
duty
to
cooperate
and
assume
your
board
of
directors
had
a
meeting
at
which
they
said,
we
don't
have
a
duty
to
do
any
of
these
things,
but
we'll
make
a
little
more
money
if
we
do
cooperate
in
the
way
they're
asking
us
to,
but
also
that'll
help
our
competitor,
strengthen
him,
whereas
if
we
adopt
the
policy
that
was
adopted
it'll
harm
our
competitors.
and
they
said,
i
think
we'd
rather
harm
our
competitor
than
do
it,
even
though
we
have
no...
would
that
present
a
problem?
justice
stevens
but
did
not
the
jury
instructions
make
intent
an
issue?
maybe
that's
wrong.
and
i
think
you
accepted
those
instructions.
justice
stevens
was
it
not
also
told
that
if
you
do
find
specific
anti-competitive
intent
plus
monopoly
power,
that
that's
a
violation?
i
don't
remember
the
exact
wording.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
that.
do
you
contend
that
there's
a
duty
to
cooperate?
justice
stevens
because
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
a
corporation
which
possesses
monopoly
power
is
not
under
a
duty
to
cooperate.
i
guess
everybody
agrees
with
that
much.
justice
stevens
weren't
you
asking
to
buy
them
at
a
discount?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
what
may
be
a
stupid
question.
can
a
normal
fellow
who
wants
to
go
skiing
buy
tickets
a
week
in
advance,
daily
tickets?
justice
stevens
it
must
be
bought
day
by
day?
justice
stevens
but
an
individual
consumer
could
not
have
gone
to
their
window
and
said,
on
monday
and
said,
i'd
like
tickets
i
can
use
on
thursday,
friday
and
saturday?
