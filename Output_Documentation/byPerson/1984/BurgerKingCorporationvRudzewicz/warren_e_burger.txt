hear
arguments
next
in
burger
king
against
rudzewicz.
mr.

i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

e.

very
well.
mr.

chief
justice

did
we
not
postpone
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
burger
at
least
not
take
it
for
granted.
chief
justice
burger
what
about
the
contract
clause?
what
do
the
contracts
say
about
that?
chief
justice
burger
if
they
had
gone
to
arbitration,
where
would
the
arbitration
have
been
conducted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
burger
i
take
your
argument
on
that
point
to
mean
that
a
cpa
making
$170,000
a
year
with
a
net
worth
of
$1
million
is
sufficiently
sophisticated
to
have
arm's
length
dealing
with
anybody.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
