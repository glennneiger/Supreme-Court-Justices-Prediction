justice

that
would
be
true
of
just
a
sale
of
a
particular
piece
of
equipment
that
is
payable
in
florida.
so
you
don't
argue
that
this
last
item
you
mentioned
would
be
enough
in
itself.
justice
white
i
don't
think
you
would
really
argue
that
just
a
requirement
that
florida
law
be
applied
to
resolve
any
disputes
would
in
itself
be
enough
to
confer
jurisdiction
in
florida.
justice
white
don't
some
states
have
some
laws
about
franchises
that
burger
king
would
have
to
abide
by
if
it
was
going
to
franchise?
justice
white
well,
in
that
respect
there
wouldn't
be
any
national
uniformity.
justice
white
comparable,
but
not
the
same.
justice
white
and
there
are
some
states
that
don't
have
them
at
all.
justice
white
and
whatever
its
contract
said.
justice
white
well,
i
mean,
absent
that
law,
the
validity
of
the
contract
would
be
governed
by
florida
law.
justice
white
is
that
right?
justice
white
and
under
michigan's
law,
under
the
franchise
law
in
michigan,
it
would
be
settled
under
michigan
law.
is
that
right?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
what
do
you
mean,
direct
appeal?
justice
white
just
an
appeal?
justice
white
didn't
they
at
least
hold
it
unconstitutional
as
applied?
justice
white
isn't
that
the
basis
for
an
appeal?
justice
white
can
you
point
to
a
single
case
that
suggests
that
a
holding
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
is
not
a
basis
for
an
appeal?
justice
white
well,
i
am
afraid
you
are
wasting
your
time,
counsel,
because
that
case
seems
to
settle
it.
justice
white
you
do
what
you
want
to.
justice
white
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that,
and
that
there
is
a
clause
for
the
application
of
florida
law
which
is
perfectly
valid.
you
haven't
lost
your
case
just
because
of
that,
have
you?
justice
white
also,
it
may
have
been
that
they
were
being
sued.
justice
white
that
doesn't
prove
anything.
justice
white
that
may
sound
good,
but
what
about
arbitration?
he
would
have
had
to
go
to
florida
to
arbitrate.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
white
the
1,200
miles.
and
you
may
need
some
witnesses.
justice
white
i
don't
know
what
you
would
say.
suppose
you
went
to...
there
was
an
arbitration.
you
went
to
florida
to
arbitrate,
and
you
lost.
justice
white
and
you
didn't
live
up
to
the
arbitrator's
award.
could
you
be
sued
in
florida
to
enforce
the
award?
