justice
rehnquist
just
to
make
sure
i
understand
what
you
and
justice
o'connor
have
been
talking
about,
the
court
of
appeals
majority
opinion
says
that
rudzewicz
concedes
that
his
activities
fall
within
the
reach
of
the
florida
long
arm
statute.
now,
there
may
have
been
a
stipulation,
but
the
court
of
appeals
talks
about
in
terms
of
a
concession.
justice
rehnquist
that
in
any
event
is
a
choice
of
law
question
rather
than
a
jurisdictional
question.
justice
rehnquist
what
about
donkey
walker?
yes,
the
donkey
walker
case.
justice
rehnquist
how
about
donkey
walker?
justice
rehnquist
but,
of
course...
i
think
the
argument
is
a
little
bit
different.
they
say
that
where
you
contracted
to
perform
an
act
that
is
to
be...
where
the
effect
is
to
take
place
in
florida,
and
fail,
then
that
is
an
act
within
the
state.
justice
rehnquist
maybe
it
was
the
pendency
of
those
cases
that
led
them
to
draft
a
form
of
contract
that
required
application
of
florida
law.
justice
rehnquist
it
may
well
be
that
had
your
client
chosen
to
initiate
litigation,
he
could
have
sued
in
michigan.
michigan
could
have
claimed
minimum
contacts.
it
would
be
upheld.
justice
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
only
michigan
could
take
jurisdiction.
justice
rehnquist
does
that
theme
come
through
from
any
of
the
cases
of
this
court?
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that...
you
contend
this
is
a
contract
of
adhesion.
what
significance
do
you
think
that
has
under
our
minimum
contacts
jurisdiction
cases?
justice
rehnquist
you
say
you
should
ignore
it.
i
don't
believe
i
follow
your
argument.
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
then
perhaps
there
should
be
a
trial,
i
suppose...
perhaps
your
opponent
would
dispute
what
you
say...
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
some
sort
of
economic
duress
in
signing
a...
before
you
decide
whether
a
state
could
take
jurisdiction
or
not?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
feel
it
would
be
different
then
if
instead
of
a
franchise
agreement
this
were...
all
the
facts,
but
it
were
a
merger
agreement
between
wendy's,
which
was
doing
business
only
in
michigan
but
had
a
huge
net
worth,
and
burger
king?
justice
rehnquist
let's
assume
that
your
client,
instead
of
being
a
cpa
who
didn't
know
the
difference
between
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant,
was
actually
a
very,
very
substantial
michigan
businessman
who
had
a
net
worth
of
millions
in
all
sorts
of
business
enterprise
all
through
michigan,
but
the
facts
of
this
case
were
exactly
the
same.
justice
rehnquist
you
say
the
result
should
be
different.
justice
rehnquist
but
i
thought
your
argument
a
moment
ago
was
that
because
burger
king
was
able
to
have
such
a
big
operation,
it
could
pay
attorneys'
fees
much
more
easily
than
your
client.
is
that
a
factor
in
your
argument?
justice
rehnquist
now,
is
there
any
one
of
our
cases
on
minimum
contact
that
supports
that
view?
