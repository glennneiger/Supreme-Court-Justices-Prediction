justice
blackmun
mr.
perwin,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
where
was
the
defendant
served?
how
was
he
served?
justice
blackmun
in
michigan?
justice
blackmun
mr.
perwin,
why
don't
we
call
it
the
court
of
appeals?
that
has
been
the
name
for
years
now,
not
circuit
court.
justice
blackmun
are
you
contending
this
is
a
contract
of
adhesion?
you
are
not
doing
that,
are
you?
justice
blackmun
are
you
arguing
that
here?
justice
blackmun
you
have
an
experienced
businessman
with
a
substantial
amount
of
money
invested,
and
a
certified
public
accountant
on
top
of
that.
