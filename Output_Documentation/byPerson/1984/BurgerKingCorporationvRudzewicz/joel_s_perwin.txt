mr.
joel
s.
perwin
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
first
question
is
whether
this
court's
jurisdiction
is
conferred
by
direct
appeal
under
subsection
1254.2.
we
submit
that
the
circuit
court
declared
unconstitutional
as
applied
a
provision
of
florida's
long
arm
statute
which
confers
jurisdiction
over
one
who
breaches
a
contract
in
florida
by
failing
to
perform
acts
required
by
the
contract
to
be
performed
in
florida,
in
this
case,
by
failing
to
make
payments
under
a
franchise
lease
and
purchase
and
sales
agreement
connected
with
a
burger
king
franchise
in
a
suburb
of
detroit,
michigan.
under
subsection
1254.2,
the
answer
to
that
question
depends
upon
the
circuit
court's
chosen
resolution
of
the
issue.
in
this
case,
as
the
circuit
court's
opinion
states,
both
parties
agree
that
by
its
plain
language
the
jurisdictional
statute
in
question
plainly
reached
the
conduct
at
issue.
rather
than
revisiting
that
assumption,
the
circuit
court
proceeded
to
consider
the
constitutional
question,
and
concluded
that
the
district
court's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
was
inconsistent
with
minimal
constitutional
requirements.
we
suggest
that
on
that
basis,
given
that
resolution,
the
prerequisites
for
the
acceptance
of
a
direct
appeal
under
subsection
1254.2
were
satisfied.
as
this
court
said
in
its
1984
franchise
tax
board
decision,
a
necessary
predicate
to
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
is
that
enforcement
of
the
state
statute
would
be
inconsistent
with
federal
law,
hence
invalid
under
the
constitution.
accordingly,
we
have
jurisdiction
under
section
1254.2.
we
also
argued
that
the
parties'
stipulation
in
the
district
court
was
an
appropriate
one
in
light
of
the
plain
language
of
this
statute
and
its
interpretation
by
a
clear
majority
of
florida
appellate
courts.
and
finally,
we
argued
that
independent
of
the
question
of
direct
appeal,
the
case
is
one
of
far-ranging
and
far-reaching
importance.
it
implicates
a
way
of
doing
business
which
is
increasingly
pervasive
in
our
society,
and
therefore
renders
appropriate
the
acceptance
of
jurisdiction
by
this
court.
my
intention
would
be
to
rest
with
that,
to
submit
the
position
of
our
brief
on
that
issue,
and
in
the
absence
of
any
inquiries,
to
proceed
to
the
merits.
the
question
on
the
merits
is
whether
the
circuit
court
erred
in
holding
that
florida's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
was
inconsistent
with
the
minimal
requirements
of
due
process,
and
that
requires,
of
course,
that
we
aggregate
the
contacts
between
these
franchisees
in
detroit
and
burger
king's
headquarters
in
miami
and
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
sufficient
affiliating
circumstances
to
put
the
franchisees
on
notice
that
they
might
be
called
to
answer
in
a
florida
court
for
any
breach
of
contract
or
trademark
infringement.
the
contacts
in
this
case
can
be
abrogated
under
two
general
categories.
the
first
might
be
applicable
to
a
case
in
which
all
we
had
was
an
arm's
length
contract
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
goods,
independent
of
the
intimacy
of
the
franchise
relationship
which
we
have
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
even
in
the
abstract
there
are
a
category
of
signals
in
the
course
of
this
relationship
and
in
the
contracts
that
were
created
between
the
parties,
which
we
submit
were
independently
sufficient
to
put
the
franchisees
on
notice
of
the
possibility
of
a
defense.
for
example,
three
separate
contracts,
the
lease
agreement,
the
franchise
agreement,
and
the
purchase
and
sale
agreement
for
equipment
all
called
for
the
application
of
florida
law,
creating
an
unmistakable
signal
of
florida's
interest
in
the
case,
and
under
this
court's
pronouncement
in
the
international
shoe
case,
suggesting
that
the
franchisees
avail
themselves
of
the
protection
and
benefits
of
the
forum.
second,
the
lease
agreement
called
for
arbitration
to
be
held
in
florida
if
necessary,
which
this
court
has
at
least
acknowledged
might
represent
a
forum
of
implicit
consent
to
jurisdiction
of
the
florida
courts.
third,
the
contracts
are
replete
with
references
to
miami
as
burger
king's
headquarters
and
as
the
locus
of
decisionmaking
in
this
case.
they
identify
burger
king
as
a
florida
corporation.
the
initial
franchise
offering
circular
informed
the
franchisees
that
burger
king
conducts
its
business
in
miami,
that
that
is
the
locus
of
decisionmaking.
all
notices
were
required
to
be
sent
by
the
franchisees
to
miami.
all
payments
were
required
to
be
sent
by
the
franchisees
to
miami.
payments
for
rent,
for
royalties,
advertising,
real
estate
taxes,
and
that,
incidentally
or
parenthetically,
should
have
made
very
clear
to
the
franchisees
that
a
default
in
their
payments
would
necessarily
cause
economic
injury
in
miami.
indeed,
in
its
recent
decision
in
the
calder
case,
this
court
in
a
footnote
adopted
the
"effects"
test
which
had
been
utilized
by
the
circuit
court
for
the
proposition
that
the
defendant
should
have
realized
that
the
effects
of
his
conduct
would
be
felt
most
deeply
in
the
forum.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
i
don't,
although
as
we
have
indicated,
the
clear
majority
of
circuit
court
decisions
appear
to
indicate
that
it
might
be
sufficient
in
a
pure
arm's
length
purchase
and
sale
agreement
which
calls
for
the
application
of
the
substantive
law
of
the
forum.
i
don't
contend
that
that
alone
is
sufficient.
it
was,
however,
it
seemed,
however,
to
be
sufficient
in
the
torts
context
in
the
calder
case,
in
which
the
enquirer
article
in
question
was
aimed
at
a
resident
of
california
who
suffered
the
injury
in
california.
i
don't
contend
that
that
is
independently
sufficient
in
this
case
and
need
not
be
so
in--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--i
think
i
agree.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
independently
sufficient,
and
again,
i
need
not
take
that
position
in
light
of
the
plethora
of
other
contacts.
finally,
the
franchise--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--well,
there
was
the
requirement
of
all
the
payments
that
he
made
to--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--if
the
cause
of
action
grew
out
of
the
contact,
i
would
suggest
that
they
could.
that
is
a
tougher
case
than
this
one.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
because...
it
is
not
exactly
the
same
thing.
because
this
case
involves
a
far
more
symbiotic
business
relationship.
this
case
involves
a
degree...
that
was
the
second
point
i
was
about
to
get
to.
this
case
involves
a
degree
of
intimate
control
by
the
franchisor
of
the
quality
of
the
franchisee's
enterprise
and
operation.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
no,
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
i
would
assert
as
strongly
as
i
can
that
the
control
was
exercised
from
miami.
it
is
true,
and
the
record
certainly
supports
the
contention
that
the
immediate
physical
contact
between
the
franchisees
and
burger
king
was
their
contact
with
the
michigan
regional
office,
but
the
control
that
we
have
been
discussing
was
exercised
exclusively
from
miami,
both
in
terms
of
the
documents
that
were
created
and
in
terms
of
more
occasional
or
ad
hoc
exercises
of
control
from
miami.
i
would
be
happy
to--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--i
don't
know
that
we
have
ever
attempted
to
do
so,
but
i
think
the
same
arguments
would
apply.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
i
think
it
would.
it
might
be
argued
in
that
case,
it
may
turn
out
in
that
case
that
burger
king
operates
in
connection
with
its
overseas
outlets
from
some
central
depository
overseas,
which
would
be
a
policymaking--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--it
would
be
if
it
were
a
policymaking
body
with
independent
decisionmaking
authority.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
that.
not
only
does
the
evidence,
taken
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
trial
court's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
to
make
that
clear,
the
uncontradicted
evidence
makes
clear
that
it
was
the
miami
headquarters
which
had
total
decisionmaking
authority
in
this
case,
and
that
the
franchisees
knew
it.
there
were
two
or
three
occasions
in
which
the
franchisees,
as
was
an
appropriate
practice,
took
a
complaint
or
grievance
or
request
to
the
michigan
headquarters
and
were
told
that
they
were
powerless
to
adjudicate
or
respond
to
the
request
because
all
decisionmaking
was
reposited
in
the
miami
headquarters.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
he
was
served
under
florida's
long
arm
statute
by
direct
personal
service
in
michigan.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
yes,
there
is
some
disagreement,
your
honor.
we
have
abrogated
13
intermediate
appellate
court
decisions
representing
all
five
of
the
intermediate
appellate
districts,
in
the
absence
of
a
dispositive
ruling
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
all
of
which
hold
that
this
statute
means
what
it
says,
and
that
the
mere
failure
to
perform
an
act,
including
the
failure
to
make
payments,
required
to
be
performed
in
florida,
is
independently
sufficient
to
invoke
the
long
arm
statute.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
i
would
argue
exactly
the
opposite.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
parties'
agreement
that--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--there
certainly
can
be
no
stipulation
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
it
might
be
a
different
question
as
to
whether
in
the
posture
of
the
constitutional
question
as
presented
to
the
circuit
court
the
parties
might
stipulate
that
florida
law
is
x
or
y.
i
would
not
question
the
circuit
court's
prerogative
to
revisit
that
stipulation
and
to
undertake
an
independent
inquiry
of
the
florida
cases.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
would
not
be
on
the
basis
of
the
parties'
stipulation
but
on
the
basis
of
the
circuit
court's
holding
that
given
that
stipulation
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
as
applied.
i
agree
that
the
circuit
court
had
the
prerogative
to
revisit
that
assumption.
my
position
is
that
because
the
circuit
court
did
not
do
so,
but
accepted
the
stipulation,
and
proceeded
to
find
that
invocation
of
the
statute
was
inconsistent
with
the
requirements
of
due
process,
that
the
circuit
court
necessarily
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
applied.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
that's
correct.
there
is
no
formal
holding
to
that
effect.
the
circuit
court
merely
begins
its
opinion
by
acknowledging
the
parties'
stipulation
and
then
declines
to
revisit
it,
not
expressly,
but
by
effectively
proceeding
to
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
i
apologize,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals.
in
addition,
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
case,
regardless
of
the
posture
in
which
it
reaches
this
court,
has
far-reaching
implications
for
the
nature
of
franchise
relationships.
it
implicates
the
franchise
relationship
as
it
exists
in
the
united
states.
it
implicates
other
forms
of
relationships
in
which
a
central
manufacturer
deals
with
a
number
of
disparate
enterprises,
and
therefore
is
appropriate
for
review
in
that
context.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
what
i
am
referring
to,
and
what
i
find
significant
in
that
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
appeared
to
have
accepted
that
concession
rather
than
undertaking
any
scrutiny
of
the
florida
decisions
in
this
area,
and
thus
far
we
have
undertaken
such
scrutiny
in
our
briefs
and
we
have
suggested
that
the
clear
majority
of
florida
decisions
comport
with
the
parties'
agreement
below.
there
was
a
second
set
of
contacts
in
this
case
independent
of
the
disparate
and
abstract
references
to
florida
as
the
center
of
decisionmaking
for
burger
king
which
are
perhaps
even
more
significant,
and
that
is
that
this
was
not
an
arm's
length
purchase
and
sales
agreement,
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
many
circuit
court
opinions
that
we
have
discussed
in
this
case
in
our
briefs.
this
was
a
20-year
interdependent
franchise
agreement,
a
lease
and
sublease
agreement
whose
purpose
was
to
create
a
continuing
relationship
between
the
parties,
not
to
separate
them
at
some
arm's
length,
but
a
continuing
relationship
between
the
parties
in
which
the
franchisees
willingly
subjected
themselves
to
a
degree
of
intimate
control
over
the
quality
and
the
very
finest
details
of
the
franchise
operation,
and
received
substantial
consideration
for
that
agreement,
the
consideration
of
minimizing
the
risk
of
failure
and
of
maximizing
the
chances
of
success
by
trading
on
a
national
reputation,
a
national
marketing
structure,
and
a
built-in
clientele.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
central
distinguishing
feature
of
your
typical
purchase
and
sales
agreement
in
which
you
have
parties
from
two
jurisdictions,
and
which
it
calls
for
the
application
of
the
law
of
one
of
them.
in
this
case
the
franchisees
had
the
unilateral
power
to
reject
the
formation
of
that
relationship.
they
had
the
perfect
option,
had
they
desired,
to
create
a
purely
local
enterprise
to
control
it
100
percent
free
of
any
or
almost
any
connection
with
interstate
commerce
and
to
do
so
free
of
any
control
by
anyone
else.
they
made
the
decision
to
reject
that
option.
instead
they
applied
to
burger
king
corporation
for
franchise
operation.
mr.
rudzewicz
is
and
was
the
senior
partner
in
an
accounting
firm.
he
had
no
expertise
or
knowledge
in
the
restaurant
business.
he
did
this
because
by
subjecting
himself
to
such
rigid
standards
and
controls,
he
was
able
to
achieve
or
seek
an
investment
success
in
an
area
in
which
he
might
not
otherwise
have
been
able
to
do
so.
he
made
that
affirmative
voluntary
decision,
and
that
seems
to
us
to
be
the
most
significant
character
of
this
relationship.
he
purposefully
entered
into
a
meaningful
business
relationship
with
a
corporation
which
he
knew
to
be
centered
in
another
jurisdiction,
and
there
are
a
plethora
of
decisions
by
this
court
on
both
sides
of
the
issue
which
seem
to
make
that
a
controlling
factor.
for
example,
in
the
mcgee
case,
it
was
the
insurer
who
had
solicited
the
business
of
the
insured
by
sending
voluntarily
and
unilaterally
a
reinsurance
certificate
into
his
state.
in
keeton,
it
was
the
magazine
who
had
made
the
purposeful
decision
to
disseminate
in
the
jurisdiction.
in
calder,
it
was
the
newspaper
which
purposefully
directed
its
article
toward
the
plaintiff.
all
cases
in
which
the
defendant
had
the
unilateral
ability
to
avoid
the
contact
which
he
voluntarily
created,
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger,
in,
for
example,
the
hanson
case,
it
was
because
the
trustee
had
undertaken
no
unilateral
activity
of
his
own
which
might
have
subjected
himself
to
jurisdiction
that
this
court
denied
florida's
jurisdiction.
in
the
kulko
case,
it
was
because
the
wife
had
moved
voluntarily
to
california
and
the
husband
had
no
control
over
that
activity
and
had
undertaken
no
unilateral
contact
of
his
own,
that
this
court
held
that
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
was
inappropriate.
in
the
rush
case,
it
was
because
the
insured
had
no
control
over
the
ubiquity
of
his
insurer,
state
farm,
and
over
its
presence
in
some
other
jurisdiction,
that
this
court
held
that
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
the
insured
was
inappropriate.
and
it
was
in
the
worldwide
volkswagen
case
that
the
court
held
that
the
regionally
focused
retail
and
wholesale
outlet
had
no
control
over
the
decision
of
a
purchaser
to
create
a
contract
with
a
jurisdiction
1,500
miles
away.
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
the
dispositive
observation
seems
to
have
been
that
the
defendant
purposefully
engaged
in
activity
which
he
had
the
unilateral
control
or
ability
to
avoid,
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
in
this
case.
in
addition,
the
cause
of
action
grew
out
of
that
activity.
there
is
no
question
that
the
requirement
of
a
connection
for
the
exercise
of
specific
jurisdiction
was
satisfied,
and
finally,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
no
significant
unfairness
in
florida's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
under
those
circumstances.
we
listed
five
factors
which
we
thought
relevant
to
the
issue
of
fairness.
i
would
like
to
mention
all
five,
and
then
come
back
to
two,
with
your
permission.
one,
florida
of
course
has
an
interest
in
protecting
a
florida
corporation.
that
encompasses
the
notion
of
sovereignty.
it
also
reflects...
it
reflects
at
the
deepest
sense
the
state's
interest
in
prescribing
a
statute
which
reaches
as
far
as
possible
to
protect
the
contractual
expectations
of
florida
residents.
as
i
mentioned,
or
may
have
mentioned,
in
the
keeton
case
this
court
seemed
to
place
dispositive
reliance
upon
new
hampshire's
interest
in
adjudicating
a
libel
action
even
for
the
benefit
of
a
new
york
resident
against
a
california
publisher
primarily
because
new
hampshire
had
an
interest
in
protecting
its
own
residents
from
the
exposure
to
libelous
material,
and
it
was
the
interest
of
the
forum
that
seemed
to
be
important.
so,
there
are
cases
which
stress
this,
and
florida
has
an
undeniable
interest
in
protecting
the
business
expectations
of
its
residents
in
the
context
of
a
contractual
obligation.
we
will
hear
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
inconvenience
of
the
franchisees
having
to
travel
to
florida
and
about
the
interest
of
michigan.
that
kind
of
argument
works
both
ways,
and
it
is
equally
relevant
to
emphasize
that
burger
king
had
a
contractual
expectation
in
miami
that
florida
by
the
plain
language
of
its
jurisdictional
statement
sought
to
accommodate
that
expectation,
and
that
the
inconvenience
of
having
to
prosecute
the
suit
in
michigan
would
have
been
comparable.
second,
florida
has
an
interest,
of
course,
in
enforcing
its
own
law,
and
that
interest
is
magnified
in
this
case
by
the
assertion
that
the
law
of
some
other
jurisdiction
might
apply.
third,
burger
king
has
an
interest
in
a
convenient
forum
and
in
some
consistency
of
result
across
a
regulatory
system
which
depends
for
its
economic
success
upon
the
adherence
by
franchisees
to
a
rigid
and
exacting
set
of
operating
requirements.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
the
only
laws
of
which
i
am
aware
are
comparable
to
that
in
michigan,
in
which
the--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--not
the
same,
no.
they
are
all--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--yes,
your
honor,
some
states
don't
have
them
at
all.
but
most
of
them,
as
michigan's
does,
appears
to
focus
on
the
relationship
between
the
parties
before
a
contract
is
formed,
on
the
offer
and
acceptance,
the
disclosure
of
information,
and
to
that
extent
of
course
burger
king
has
to
comply
with
the
laws
of
any
jurisdiction.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
well,
i
suppose
that's
a
choice
of--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--perhaps
in
the--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
but
in
this
case
my
position
is
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
florida
law
and
michigan
law.
in
a
case
in
which...
and
therefore
both
can
apply
undisturbed.
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
such
a
conflict,
i
would
argue
that
the
parties'
voluntary
choice
of
substantive
law
should
override
the
franchise
law
of
any
interested
jurisdiction
unless
under
the
typical
choice
of
law
analysis
the
application
of
the
law
chosen
by
contract
is
so
fortuitously
related
to
the
cause
of
action
as
to
render
its
application
unfair,
and
if
the
law,
franchise
law
of
the
other
interested
jurisdiction
is
so
fundamental
to
its
policy
that
the
florida
court
might
agree
to
yield,
it
is
unclear
that
either
criteria
is
satisfied
in
this
case.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and
what
is
relevant
for
the
purposes
of
jurisdiction
is
not
so
much
the
question
of
what
substantive
law
might
apply
as
a
product
of
that
process,
but
rather
that
the
parties
put
in
their
contract
that
they
agree
to
comply
with
the
law
of
the
state
of
florida,
and
therefore
had
reason
to
know
that
they
were
both
invoking
the
benefits
of
florida
law
and
might
be
called
to
answer
for
breach
of
contract
in
a
florida
court.
what
is
important
is
that
they
contracted
for
the
application
of
florida
law,
and
not
simply
that
the
substantive
choice
of
law
process
might
call
for
the
application
of
florida
law.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
no,
of
course,
it
is
not
conceivable,
but
that
does
not
undermine
the
objective
of
trying
to
create
some
centrality
of
decisions
on
the
contract
issues
that
exist
between
the
parties,
on
the
question
of
breach,
on
the
measure
of
damages,
on
the
expectations
of
the
parties
in
a
contractual
relationship.
obviously,
if
a
franchisee
fails
to
comply
with
some
sanitary
law
which
is
in
effect
in
the
locality,
it
will
be
the
operation
of
that
law
which
determines
the
outcome.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
observation
does
not
undermine
the
central
objective
of
burger
king
in
trying
to
obtain
some
substantive
consistency
in
connection
with
the
central
relationship
between...
contractual
relationship
between
the
parties,
and
that
is
best
served
by...
i
mean,
this
court
has
said
in
a
variety
of
contexts
that
that
is
best
served
by
adjudication
of
these
issues
in
a
single
court.
that
was
first
said
in
1816
in
martin
versus
hunters
lessee,
in
which
this
court
established
the
right
of
review
over
state
decisions
of
constitutional
dimension,
and
the
central
thesis
of
that
opinion
is
that
uniformity
of
decisionmaking
in
a
judicial
context
is
essential,
and
as
recently
as
the
m.s.
bremen
case
upholding
the
enforcement
of
a
forum
clause,
the
court
said
the
same
thing
about
consistency
of
result.
with
your
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
a
few
points,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
very
briefly,
a
few
disparate
points.
number
one,
mr.
rudzewicz
was
represented
by
counsel
throughout
his
dealings
with
burger
king.
his
lawyer
was
out
of
town
the
weekend
before
the
closing.
he
did
not
ask
for
a
delay
in
order
to
consult
with
his
lawyer.
at
the
time
of
trial
he
had
a
net
worth
of
$1
million
and
was
making
$170,000
a
year.
the
trial
court...
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
economic
duress
or
coercion
in
any
form.
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
did
not
reach
that
issue.
number
two,
there
were
a
fair
number
of
contacts
with
the
regional
office.
we
don't
deny
that.
on
the
other
hand,
it
cannot
be
denied
that
there
were
substantial--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--yes.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
well,
a
mom
and
pop
grocery
store
is
not
a
franchise.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
yes,
it
would,
if
the
plaintiff
had
the
same
measure
of
control
over
the
activities
of
the
enterprise.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
with
respect
to
the
product,
and
it
weren't
simply
an
arm's
length
purchase
and
sale
agreement
which
included
a
license.
that
is
one
of
the
keys
to
this
case,
is
that
from
miami,
burger
king
exercised
intimate
daily
control
over
the
quality
of
this
franchise,
not
just
through
the
manuals
and
the
contracts,
but
through
day-to-day
contacts,
and
there
weren't
just
contacts
with
the
regional
office
on
the
policy
questions,
on
the
question
that
needed
to
be
negotiated,
there
were
direct
contacts
by
telephone
and
by
letter
directly
between
miami
and
the
franchisees.
it
is
incorrect
to
say
that
their
only
expectation
was
that
the
sole
physical
embodiment
of
burger
king
was
in
michigan.
that
is
simply
incorrect.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
no,
it
is
just
rebuttal.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
if
he
were--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--if
the
facts
were
otherwise
the
same,
yes.
i
caution
that--
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
--yes.
i
caution
that
as
the
court
has
said
repeatedly,
every
case
should
be
cited
on
its
own
facts,
but
yes,
if
that
were
the
only
change,
i
submit,
i
agree
that
the
burden
of
my
position
is
that
jurisdiction
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
i
agree,
and
a
fairly
disturbing
implication.
it
is
equally
disturbing
from
the
other
side
that
a
corporation
should
somehow
be
at
a
disadvantage
because
of
its
net
worth
before
this
court.
mr.
joel
s.
perwin
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
so,
and
in
this
case
that
arm's
length
dealing
produced
a
contract
which
called
for
an
intimate
20-year
relationship
controlled
by
a
company
whose
finest
details
were
controlled
by
a
company
based
in
florida
and
entitled
to
the
protection
of
a
florida
law
which
sought
to
preserve
its
business,
its
legitimate
business
expectations.
the
nature
of
that
contract
was
inherent
in
burger
king's
business
relationship.
the
due
process
clause
should
not
be
utilized
to
force
burger
king
to
increase
the
price
of
its
hamburgers
and
to
pass
them
on
to
franchisees
and
on
to
the
public
in
order
to
decentralize.
that
is
an
internal
business
decision,
and
the
due
process
clause
should
not
reach
that
far.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed,
and
the
cause
remanded
with
instructions
to
affirm
the
district
court's
judgment.
