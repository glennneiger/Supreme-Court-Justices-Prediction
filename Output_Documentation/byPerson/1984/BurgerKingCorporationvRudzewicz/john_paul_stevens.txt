justice
stevens
your
other
two
contracts
really
are
the
headquarters
and
an
arbitration
provision.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
right.
supposing
i
opened
a
bank
account
in
a
florida
bank,
and
they
said
any
disputes
would
be
resolved
under
florida
law,
and
if
we
can
arbitrate,
we
will
arbitrate
here
at
headquarters.
could
they
sue
me
for
amounts
above
what
i
had
on
deposit?
justice
stevens
why
is
it
tougher?
why
isn't
it
exactly
the
same
case?
justice
stevens
but
that
is
control
exercised
in
michigan.
justice
stevens
you
have
international
franchisees,
as
i
understand
the
record,
london
and
some
other
places.
could
you
get
jurisdiction
over
a
london
franchisee
in
miami
the
same
way?
justice
stevens
your
theory
would
apply,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
that
would
be
no
different
from
your
michigan
branch
office,
would
it?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
stevens
my
i
just
ask
this
question,
just
again
limited
to
your
point
about
your
client's
interest
in
a
consistent
interpretation
of
the
law.
in
addition
to
different
franchise
law
possibilities
in
different
states,
aren't
there
all
sorts
of
things
that
may
be
governed
by
local
law?
i
mean,
i
suppose
they
have
to
comply
with
michigan
food
and
drug
laws,
michigan
zoning
laws,
usury
laws.
there
are
all
kinds
of
laws
that
might
not
be
the
same
as
they
are
in
florida,
so
it
is
really
conceivable
that
everything
can
be
done
on
a
nationwide
basis
on
this
theory?
justice
stevens
are
you
serious
in
saying
a
certified
public
accountant
doesn't
know
the
difference
between
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
going
back
to
your
contract
of
adhesion
argument,
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
that
there
was
no
economic
duress.
justice
stevens
doesn't
that
blow
that
out
of
the
water?
because
we
are
not
going
to
review
findings
of
fact.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
on
this
sort
of
fat
cat-small
cat
argument,
would
it
be
a
different
case
if
he
just
owned
a
mom
and
pop
grocery
store?
justice
stevens
you
think
you
would
not
have
jurisdiction,
even
if
you
had
all
your
other
factors?
justice
stevens
but
they
had
a
contract
to
be
able
to
use
the
name,
whatever,
some
franchise
product,
as
a
lot
of
them
do,
saying,
and
any
dispute
of
it
will
be
governed
by
florida
law,
and
we
will
arbitrate
in
florida
if
we
have
to,
and
wouldn't
it
be
the
same
case?
justice
stevens
correct,
with
respect
to
the
product
in
dispute.
justice
stevens
just
to
boil
it
down,
you
really
don't
rely
on
the
fact
that
he
had
$1
million.
justice
stevens
if
he
were
bankrupt,
it
would
be
the
same
case.
justice
stevens
or
just
on
the
fringe.
justice
stevens
if
the
contractual
relationship
was
otherwise
the
same.
justice
stevens
it
is
quite
important,
because
the
question
whether
a
wealthy
man
has
a
right
to
move
for
want
of
jurisdiction
on
a
different
standard
than
one
who
doesn't
have
much
money
is
really
a
fairly
important
question
of
whether
we
administer
the
law
with
an
even
hand.
