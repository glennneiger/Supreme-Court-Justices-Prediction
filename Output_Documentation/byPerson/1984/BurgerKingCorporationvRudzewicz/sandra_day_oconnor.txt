justice
o'connor
mr.
perwin,
it
isn't
clear
to
me,
at
least,
whether
florida
itself
would
apply
the
standards
for
personal
jurisdiction
that
you
apparently
stipulated
would
be
sufficient.
what
is
the
florida
law
on
the
personal
jurisdiction
standard?
aren't
the
courts
in
that
state
in
some
disagreement?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
court
of
appeals
itself
recognized
that
it
isn't
clear
in
florida
law.
justice
o'connor
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
parties'
stipulation
in
lieu
of
a
determination
of
what
florida
law
provides.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
you
can
just
stipulate
to
jurisdiction?
justice
o'connor
for
our
purposes?
justice
o'connor
it
could
make
our
decision
just
advisory
if
we
are
deciding
it
on
the
basis
of
your
stipulation
as
to
what
florida
law
is.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
court
of
appeals
i
thought
did
not
hold
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
florida
statute
would
allow
state
courts
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
it
relevant
in
that
regard
that
the
contract
envisioned
a
20-year
relationship
with
the
florida
corporation,
and
the
length
and
the
detail
of
the
involvement
with
that
corporation
seemed
to
make
it
foreseeable
that
your
client
might
be
hauled
before
the
florida
court?
justice
o'connor
wasn't
he
sued
for
failing
to
make
payments?
justice
o'connor
and
the
payments
were
to
be
made
in
florida?
