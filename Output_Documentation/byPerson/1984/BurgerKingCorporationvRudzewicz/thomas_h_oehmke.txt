mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
an
interesting
aspect
of
this
case,
of
course,
is
that
the
question
of
whether
this
is
a
direct
appeal
or
not
was
suggested
when
the
court
noted
its
probable
jurisdiction.
we
felt
that
that
was
an
issue
that
deserved
some
briefing
on
our
part,
and
indeed
in
our
reply
brief
did
spend
some
substantial
time
on
that
portion,
but
not
to
ignore
the
minimum
contacts
requirement,
of
course.
obviously,
this
court
could
elect
not
to
take
a
direct
appeal
and
certainly
rule
on
the
issues
by
petition
for
certiorari,
but
for
just
a
moment
i
would
like
to
comment
on
whether
or
not
there
is
a
direct
appeal,
knowing,
of
course,
this
court's
desire
to,
if
it
can,
allow
the--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--an
appeal.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
yes,
an
appeal
as
opposed
to
a
petition
for
cert.
thank
you,
justice
white.
in
this
case
here--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--yes.
i
suppose
we
implied
that
that
may
have
been
a
note
of
probable
jurisdiction,
but
i
think
it
meant
that
we
needed
to
wrestle
with
that
issue
somewhat
in
our
briefing,
and
we
did
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
that's
right.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
in
this
case
here
we
think
it
was
possible
to
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
not
necessarily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
the
florida
statute
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals,
we
believe,
could
have
said,
but
didn't,
because
it
never
made
a
pronouncement,
that
we
are
holding
it
unconstitutional
or
we
are
not--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--yes,
they
did,
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
i
think
not.
when
we
look
at
the
word
"as
applied",
we
see
some
mention
of
it
certainly
in
previous
cases,
but
as
applied
to
a
particular
defendant
rather
than
as
applied
to
everyone
in
a
particular
state.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
no,
i
can't,
because
we
had
some
struggle
as
we
looked
for
the
term
or
the
phrase
"as
applied",
to
try
to
learn
and
be
educated
what
the
court
has
meant
by
that
in
the
past.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
we
think
that
if
you
apply
it
only
to
one--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--i
can't
respond
to
that
case,
justice
brennan.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
if
that
certainly
is
the
sentiment
of
the
court,
then
it
would
settle
it.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
thank
you.
we
just
think
the
court
did
not
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
it
applied
to
everyone
in
the
state.
we
think
what
the
court
said
was
that
perhaps
you
may
fall
within
the
literal
grasp
or
the
literal
meaning
of
the
statute,
but
we
are
not
going
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
all
we
are
going
to
say
is
that
when
we
see
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant.
in
this
particular
case
it
works
a
manifest
injustice
because
it
is
unfair
to
him.
he
has
no
minimum
contacts
in
florida.
i
would
like
to
move
along
if
i
can
to
the
issue
of
minimum
contacts
and
what
we
think
is
really
happening
here.
burger
king
is
actually
asking
this
court
to
allow
it
by
means
of
this
case
to
be
able
to
take
jurisdiction
over
a
franchisee
wherever
that
franchisee
is
found.
mr.
perwin
seemed
to
concede
to
justice
stevens--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--the
contract
had
a
choice
of
law
provision,
and
it
had
a
choice
of
forum
provision
for
arbitration,
but
not
for
litigation.
with
respect
to
the
choice
of
law
provision,
we
think
that
there
is
case
law
that
says
that
when
a
state
like
michigan
has
a
comprehensive,
systematic
franchise
act,
as
they
do,
that
parties
can't
agree
to
disregard
that
and
just
apply
any
other
law
that
they
particularly
would
like
to
see
applied.
so,
we
think
that
the
choice
of
law
provision
here
is
inapplicable.
parties
can't
contract
to
ignore
a
major
piece
of
public
policy
legislation
in
a
state.
but
further,
burger
king
has
admitted
in
their
briefs
and
in
court
that
michigan
law
applies
here.
in
essence
they
are
abandoning
what
the
contractual
language
says.
we
have
cited
many
points
in
our...
many
times
in
our
response
brief--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--i
don't
think
we
have.
in
this
particular
case
here,
even
if
we
are
going
to
choose
to
apply
florida
law,
there
still
has
to
be
minimum
contacts
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
who
had
absolutely
no
contacts
with
the
state
of
florida
whatsoever.
interestingly,
the
choice
of
forum
provision
in
the
contract
only
applied
to
arbitration,
not
to
litigation,
so
we
think
that
the
choice
of
law
forum
here
not
only
should
not
be
applied,
because
we
have
a
michigan
comprehensive
statute
that
regulates
franchises
that
florida
doesn't
have,
but
we
also
think
that
burger
king
has
abandoned
that
argument.
as
we
take
a
look
at
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
mr.
rudzewicz
did
have
minimum
contacts,
we
find
a
whole
host
of
things
that
he
never
did
in
florida.
we
find
that
he
didn't
incorporate
his
business
there,
but
rather,
in
michigan.
he
had
no
employees
in
florida.
all
employees
were
in
michigan.
that
he
had
no
business
location
or
site
for
doing
business
in
florida,
only
in
michigan.
that
he
didn't
have
an
agent
in
the
forum.
he
promulgated
no
advertisements
directed
to
a
florida
market.
he
did
not
solicit
business
within
the
state
of
florida,
either
in
person
or
by
mail
or
by
tv
or
radio
or
periodical.
he
did
not
do
anything
deliberate
and
purposeful
in
florida
to
avail
himself
of
the
market
in
florida
or
the
benefits
and
protections
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
except
to
sign
the
contract,
justice
marshall,
the
contract
which
did
say
that
it
was
entered
into
and
made
in
florida,
when
the
reality
of
the
situation
was,
physically
it
was
signed
in
michigan,
and
burger
king
then
mailed
it
down
to
its
headquarters
people
for
signing.
that
was
the
only
thing
that
he
did,
was
to
sign
a
contract
with
a
florida-based
corporation,
and
perhaps
secondly,
as
burger
king
has
argued,
he
failed
to
mail
a
check
to
the
state
of
florida,
or
failed
to
mail
his
checks
for
royalty
and
for
advertising
payments.
so,
burger
king
suggests
that
a
non-act,
a
failure
to
do
an
act,
a
failure
to
mail
a
check
in
and
of
itself
is
a
contact
if
the
state
law
requires
you
to
do
that.
we
think
the
florida
law
can
be
construed
quite
well
constitutionally.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
we
have
to
believe
that
this...
justice
rehnquist,
that
this
is
not
a
substantial
enough
contact
to
elevate
itself
to
the
level
of
a
constitutionally
imagined
minimum
contact.
failure
to
mail
a
check
standing
by
itself
flies
in
the
face
of
the
history
of
decisions
that
have
said
you
ought
to
have
a
purposeful,
an
affirmative
act,
where
you
deliberately
intend
to
invoke
the
benefits
and
protections
of
the
laws,
and
that
should
probably
lead
one
to
conclude
that
you
have
a
continuous
and
systematic
doing
of
business
in
a
state.
there
was
no
continuous
and
systematic
doing
of
business
in
florida.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
i
think
not
for
this
reason,
justice
o'connor.
all
of
the
contacts
between
mr.
rudzewicz
and
burger
king
were
contacts
with
the
burger
king
office
in
birmingham,
michigan,
a
suburb
of
detroit,
where
burger
king
had
dozens
of
staff
and
a
fully
furnished
office.
the
contacts
with
rudzewicz
were
there.
they
interviewed
him
there
to
see
if
they
liked
him
as
a
franchisee.
they
blessed
and
approved
him
as
a
franchisee
there.
correspondence
arrived
from
that
particular
office.
he
went
and
visited
that
office
during
the
course
of
the
negotiations,
never
visited
florida,
and
every
single
contact
he
had
was
with
the
birmingham,
michigan,
office
of
burger
king.
when
it
came
time
to
sign
the
contract,
they
brought
the
contract
to
him
in
michigan.
he
signed
it
and
gave
them
his
$40,000
check
in
michigan,
plus
another
five
for
a
site
development
fee.
so,
i
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
contracts
with
a
corporation
that
may
be
headquartered
elsewhere
or
doing
business
elsewhere
does
not
put
one
on
notice
that
they
are
necessarily
going
to
be
sued
there.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
in
fact,
our
client
did
not
have
legal
advice,
but
that
is
not
in
the
record,
justice
marshall.
we
have
evidence
in
the
record
that
says
there
is
a
state
requirement
that
you
give
a
contract
seven
days
in
advance
for
the
obvious
purpose
so
one
can
think
about
it
and
cogitate
about
it.
this
contract
was
given
to
mr.
rudzewicz
four
days
in
advance,
and
he
was
told
to
either
sign
it
or
rip
out
all
of
his
$180,000
worth
of
furniture,
fixtures,
and
equipment,
so
i
think
one
can
conclude
from
the
record
that--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--that's
right.
well,
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
advising
him
at
that
time,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
that.
justice
o'connor,
i
would
like
to
go
back
and
share
something
with
the
other
justices
that
we
did
not
put
in
our
reply
brief
that
has
to
do
with
notice.
in
the
joint
appendix
is
the
burger
king
prospectus,
which
was
the
document
that
they
used
to
encourage
people
to
take
the
franchise
up.
at
pages
17
through
21
in
the
prospectus,
burger
king
is
required
by
michigan
law
to
list
all
of
the
litigation
that
it
is
involved
in.
when
you
look
at
page
17
to
21,
there
are
seven
cases
that
burger
king
disclosed.
six
out
of
the
seven
of
those
cases
are
not
in
florida.
there
is
only
one
case
in
florida.
so,
if
one
takes
a
look
at
the
prospectus,
which
lists
cases
in
colorado
and
new
jersey,
indiana,
connecticut,
georgia,
and
then
one
in
florida,
certainly--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--i
think
in
part
it
was,
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
what
burger
king
has
had
in
mind--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
all
of
those
cases
they
were
defendants,
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
to
we
as
lawyers
it
doesn't,
and
as
the
court,
but
to
a
certified
public
accountant
who
doesn't
understand
the
difference
between
defendant
and
plaintiff,
for
him
to
read
the
fact
that
there
are
six
out
of
seven
cases
in
other
states,
i
think,
doesn't
put
him
on
notice
that
he
could
only
expect
to
be
used
in
florida.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
i
am
not
serious
in
only
stopping
at
that
point.
i
am
not
trying
to
be
facetious.
he
doesn't
understand
what
that
means
when
you
look
at
where
you
are
going
to
sue
somebody
or
where
you
are
not
going
to
sue
somebody.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
appendix,
burger
king
was
the
defendant
in
every
case,
and
they
were
being
sued
where
they
were
found.
i
just
don't
think
he
understands
the
implication
of
that
when
it
comes
to
jurisdiction
and
being
put
on
notice
where
he
is
going
to
be
sued.
so,
in
this
particular
case
here,
he
was
not
put
on
notice.
to
come
back
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
for
just
a
moment,
i
think
that
burger
king
has
finely
tuned
and
finely
honed
a
contract
to
the
point
where
they
have
invoked
every
incantation
that
they
can
to
be
given
the
best
possible
chance
of
suing
people
in
florida,
where
they
are
filing.
burger
king
does
business
in
the
state
of
michigan.
it
has
some
60
restaurants
there,
and
it
has
a
michigan
regional
office.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
i
agree.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
you
are
right
in
your
analysis
that
we
could
have
sued
in
michigan
had
we
been
quicker
to
the
draw,
but
we
don't
think
that
florida
should
take
jurisdiction
here
because
there
is
no
continuous
and
systematic
doing
of
business
in
the
state
of
florida.
he
didn't
go
there
and
didn't
do
anything
there,
and
i
don't
think
that
as
a
cpa
he
is
put
on
notice
by
the
mere
fact
that
he
is
dealing
with
a
florida
headquarters
corporation,
that
he
can
be
expected
to
be
sued
there.
other
cases
that
we
have
heard,
cases
where
corporations
are
incorporated
in
delaware,
just
the
mere
fact
that
that
is
where
they
are
incorporated
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
one
can
be
expected
to
be
sued
where
it
is
incorporated
or
where
its
headquarters.
you
know,
if
that
is
true,
just
because
one
does
business
with
a
corporation
that
is
headquartered
or
located
in
another
state,
you
can
be
expected
to
sue
there,
be
sued
there,
if
that
alone
is
enough,
then
everyone
who
does
business
with
another
corporation
ought
to
find
out
where
they
are
incorporated,
and
where
they
are
located,
and
they
ought
to
build
into
the
cost
of
the
operation
of
their
business
enough
money
to
go
to
that
state
and
defend.
one
of
the
themes
that
has
come
through
some
of
these
cases
is
that
burger
king
is
in
a
better
position
economically
to
build
into
the
cost
of
their
doing
business
enough
money
to
finance
litigation
for
them
to
go
where
they
are
doing
business.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
no,
they
haven't.
they
have
come
through
from
some
of
the
court
of
appeals
cases.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
in
florida,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
of
the
choice
of
forum
provision,
because
parties
can
contract,
of
course,
to
go
to
a
different
state.
they
could
contract
to
go
to
germany
or
guam,
we
suppose,
to
arbitrate,
but
we
don't
think
the
parties
can
contract
and
confer
jurisdiction
on
a
state
by
the
mere
pledge
that
that
is
where
they
are
going
to
go.
we
think
the
choice
of
law
provision
is
different
than
a
choice
of
forum
provision,
and
we
don't
think
that
you
can
choose
a
forum
to
litigate
in
if
there
is
no
minimum
contact
of
a
defendant
there.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
we
have
made
that
allegation
throughout
our
litigation
at
every
level,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
yes,
we
have
argued
that
in
our
brief.
we
have
used
that
phrase.
and
the
reason
why
we
argue
that
in
part
is
because
this
is
a
some...
i
can't
tell
you
the
exact
number
of
pages,
10
or
12
or
14-page
franchise
agreement
that
is
typeset
in
single
space.
it
has
two
variables,
i
believe,
that
you
can
put
in
the
contract,
the
date
it
it
signed
in
the
franchise
agreement
and
the
jural
form
of
who
the
franchisee
is
going
to
be.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
that
is
right.
the
facts,
justice
blackmun,
will
indicate
here
that
mr.
rudzewicz
was
orally
told
throughout
the
entire
six-month
negotiation
process
with
the
detroit
burger
king
people
that
he
could
do
business
as
a
franchisee
in
a
corporate
forum,
and
it
was
only
when
four
days
before
the
franchise
was
to
open
that
burger
king
said,
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
do
business
in
the
form
of
a
corporation,
you
must
be
individually
liable.
he
screamed
surprise,
and
they
said,
through
mr.
hoffman,
their
regional
manager,
fine,
you
are
surprised,
tear
out
the
$180,000
worth
of
equipment
or
sign
the
contract.
we
feel
that
it
was
not
only
the
nature
of
the
contract
but
the
way
the
economic
gun
was
pointed
to
his
head
that
forced
him
in
that
four-day
period,
less
than
what
the
state
statute
requires,
to
sign
it.
those
are
facts
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
only
this,
justice
rehnquist.
to
the
extent
that
one
wishes
to
give
some
credence
to
a
choice
of
law
provision,
i
think
if
there
is
any
weight
to
that
or
weight
to
arbitrating
in
florida
versus
michigan,
i
think
one
can
ignore
that
because
of
the
nature
of
this
contract.
there
was
nothing
to
be
bargained
in
this
contract
by
mr.
rudzewicz.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
first
of
all,
we
have
argued
that
we
think
it
is
unlawful
to
force
the
parties
to
go
to
florida
just
because...
because
michigan
law...
because
there
are
no
contacts
there,
but
to
the
extent
you
wish
to
give
some
weight
to
the
fact
that
the
parties
openly
and
voluntarily
negotiated
and
agreed
on
a
choice
of
law
forum...
choice
of
law
provision,
we
don't
think
there
was
any...
there
was
no
bargaining,
and
so
i
think
you
can
ignore
giving
any
weight
to
that
aspect
of
the
contract.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
no,
we
don't
say
that.
we
are
saying
that
the
court
ought
to
do
a
test
and
at
least
check
and
see
whether
there
are
minimum
contacts
of
a
particular
defendant
in
a
state,
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
said,
yes,
florida
law
applies
here.
it
did
the
first
prong
of
a
test,
but
it
didn't
do
the
second
prong
of
the
test.
all
we
are
saying
is,
if
one
wishes
to
invoke
the
good
services
and
offices
of
a
federal
district
court
as
a
trial
court,
that
trial
court
not
only
looks
at
the
state
long
arm
statute,
but
ought
to
do
a
check
and
see
whether
the
second
prong
of
that
test
is
met.
namely,
does
the
defendant
have
some
contact
in
that
state,
some
minimum
contact.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
no,
and
we
are
really
not
asking
you
to
take
that
up
as
an
issue.
justice
blackmun
asked
me
if
we
are
contending
it.
yes,
we
have
contended
it
throughout,
but
it
is
not
an
issue
that
we
are
presenting
to
this
court.
we
have
talked
about
a
theme,
not
in
this
court
but
in
some
courts
of
appeals,
where
it
is
burger
king
who
can
build
into
the
cost
of
their
doing
business
the
money
it
takes
to
do
a
litigation
like
this.
the
record
below
does
indicate
that
at
this
point
in
time
burger
king
has
been
paid
more
than
$30,000
in
legal
fees.
at
this
point
in
time...
that
is
just
for
the
district
court
action.
rudzewicz
is
liable
personally
not
only
for
his
own
attorney
fees
if
he
should
not
prevail,
but
the
attorney
fees
for
burger
king.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
follow
you,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
yes,
i
think
the
result
should
be
different
in
this
sense,
that
just
because
someone
has
a
great
net
worth
and
happens
to
be
a
cpa
doesn't
necessarily
put
him
on
notice
about
the
fine
points
of
jurisdiction
or
venue.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
yes,
it
is,
and
build
into
their
cost
of
running
the
franchise
enough
money
to
pay
for
their
going
to
michigan,
because
they
are
already
in
michigan
and
they
have
local
attorneys
in
michigan
anyway.
this
case
is
being...
we
are...
on
this
particular
case
in
michigan
district
court
on
enforcement
of
the
judgment.
they
have
attorneys
in
michigan,
and
an
office
there.
we
think
they
should
build
into
the
cost
of
franchises
another
penny
a
whopper
or
whatever
it
costs
to
build
up
the
funds
they
need
to
go
to
michigan
and
to
sue
their
franchisees
where
their
franchisees
are
found.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
no,
there
is
not,
justice
rehnquist.
we
just
think
that
burger
king
is
in
a
better
position.
we
suggest
that
as
some
logic
that
may
offer
some
fruit
here.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--no,
we
are
just
saying
that
when
the
fat
cat
sues
the
small
cat,
the
fat
cat
is
in
a
better
position
to
build
into
the
cost
of
taxing
the
franchisee
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
litigation.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
no,
not
that
he
has
to
pay.
only
that
he
is
in
a
better
position.
what
we
are
suggesting
is--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--this
is...
i
guess
this
gets
us
down
to
the...
who
pays?
in
this
case
the
defendant
has
paid.
but
our
thinking
is
that
the
nature
of
a
franchise
relationship
is
a
new
type
of
doing
business.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
right,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
that's
right.
that
would
be
right.
but
this
court
still
applies.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
only
if
one
can
agree
that
people
can
contract
jurisdiction
away.
we
don't
think
there
are
any
minimum
contacts
in
florida,
and
we
think
even
if
the
parties
put
a
bold
face
choice
of
forum
provision
in
there,
since
there
were
no
minimum
contacts
in
florida,
we
think
it
would
be
contrary
to
public
policy.
the
parties
can't
confer
jurisdiction
by
contract.
all
i
am
suggesting
with
the
economic
argument
is
that
burger
king
franchises
are
small
business
operations
essentially.
mr.
rudzewicz,
the
investment
for
this
particular
franchise
is
around
$225,000.
this
is
running
a
small
hamburger
operation
serving
essentially
a
community,
serving
essentially
a
neighborhood.
it
is
a
new
form
and
one
of
the
new
ways
of
doing
business
in
this
country.
the
ma
and
pa
grocery
store
have
been
substituted
in
large
part
by
7-11's.
the
hamburger
stands
have
been
substituted
by
macdonald's
and
wendy's
and
burger
kings.
but
they
are
still...
the
nature
of
them
is
still
a
small
restaurant,
still
serving
a
small
community,
run
by
small
business
people,
and
burger
king
comes
to
the
state
of
michigan,
it
does
business
in
the
state
michigan
by
opening
16
restaurants
and
putting
an
extensive
staff
there.
we
think
they
should
opt
to
sue
their
franchisees
in
michigan,
too.
they
haven't
done
that.
they
have
elected
not
do
to
that,
not
to
sue
their
franchisees.
they
want
to
bring
them
all
to
miami,
including,
i
guess,
the
ones
from
london
and
spain
and
new
zealand
and
guam,
where
they
elsewhere
have
offices,
and
perhaps
alaska
and
hawaii.
that
would
be
manifestly
unfair,
to
make
a
new
rule
in
minimum
contacts
that
says,
just
because
you
are
dealing
with
a
national
business
headquartered
in
one
spot,
you
should
go
to
them
because
you
are
put
on
notice
they
might
sue
you
there,
even
if
there
are
no
minimum
contacts.
we
think
it
is
manifestly
unfair
that
he
should
have
to
travel
the
1,200
miles
to
miami
to
fight
this
lawsuit
when
he
never
set
foot
in
miami
about
this
deal,
and
has
no
contact
with
that
state.
and
burger
king's
new
approach
that
they
are
suggesting
here
is
wholly
different
from
what
it
used
to
be,
and
from
what
is,
from
what
is
the
state
of
law
at
this
present
time.
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
all
of
the
contacts
were
in
michigan.
they
reviewed
the
record,
and
they
noted
the
fact
that
rudzewicz
was
interviewed
there,
and
that
the
michigan
office
discussed
price
terms,
and
that
the
michigan
office
attended
the
final
closing
ceremony,
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
rudzewicz
bargained
with
anyone
in
miami,
only
with
people
in
michigan.
so,
every
single
contact
with
burger
king
happened
in
the
state
of
michigan,
with
the
michigan
staff,
and
the
bargaining
occurred
there,
and
the
acceptance
of
these
gentlemen
as
franchisees
occurred
in
the
state
of
michigan.
so
we
think
that
since
all
essential
elements
of
the
transaction
are
found
in
michigan,
that
is
where
the
lawsuit
should
be,
and
that
is
where
the
contacts
are.
we
feel
there
needs
to
be
some
protection
of
franchisees
in
order
to
protect
it
as
a
form
of
business.
if
this
court
were
to
rule
that
franchisees
could
be
sued
wherever
the
headquarters
of
the
franchise
was,
then
franchisees
who
do
business
in
the
future
have
to
be
able
to
say,
i
have
to
build
into
the
cost
of
doing
business
enough
reserve
money
to
one
day
be
able
to
go
to
florida
and
defend
myself
against
burger
king.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
normal
profit
on
the
sale
of
a
hamburger,
it
is
around
ten
cents
on
a
$1.25
hamburger,
and
to
finance
a
lawsuit
like
this,
to
pay
both
sides
might
cost
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
dollars,
which
means
selling
about
two
million
hamburgers
in
order
to
make
enough
profit
to
set
them
aside
in
reserves
to
defend
a
case
like
this.
the
local
business
is
not
in
a
good
position,
is
not
well
equipped
in
serving
a
small
community
to
have
to
finance
such
distant
litigation.
of
course,
there
is
the
inconvenience
on
the
part
of
the
franchisees,
who
had
to
either
bring
deposition
testimony
down
or
bring
all
of
the
live
witnesses
down.
all
of
the
people
that
mr.
rudzewicz
dealt
with
were
in
michigan.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
i
agree
that
we
would
have
to
go
to
florida
to
arbitrate.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
that
is
right.
yet
one
can
make
some
distinction
between
the
arbitration
process
and
the
litigation
process.
not
completely.
it
certainly
is
more
expeditious,
takes
less
time,
doesn't
require
as
many
trips
down.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
i
think
so,
justice
white.
i
think
it
could
be
enforced
in
the
state
of
florida.
i
would
then
have
to
argue
to
this
court
about
the
nature
of
that
contract
of
adhesion
and
get
into
that
as
an
issue
more
solidly
than
we
have
brought
that
issue
here.
we
think
that
there
should
be
a
three-pronged
test,
in
conclusion,
to
determining
whether
or
not
the...
where
a
person
should
be
sued.
we
think
the
first
test
should
be
whether
the
defendant
commits
a
purposeful
act
or
an
affirmative
act
to
avail
himself
of
the
benefits
and
protections
of
the
state
of
florida.
we
don't
think
rudzewicz
did
any
act
in
this
particular
case
to
do
that,
certainly
not
a
substantial
act.
secondly,
we
think
that
it
ought
to
be
fair
and
reasonable
that
he
be
sued
in
florida.
we
don't
think
it
is
fair
and
reasonable
in
this
case.
and
thirdly,
we
think
there
should
be
some
connection
between
the
subject
matter
of
the
lawsuit,
namely,
the
operation
of
a
burger
king
franchise,
and
the
state
of
florida,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
michigan
has
passed
comprehensive
legislation
regulating
the
behavior
of
franchisors
and
franchisees,
legislation
that
would
apply
here.
we
feel--
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
--yes,
he
was.
mr.
thomas
h.
oehmke
yes,
he
was,
justice
o'connor,
and
he
was
brought
into
florida
on
the
sole
basis
that
he
had
failed
to
send
his
check.
and
that
was
all
that
was
done.
so
we
feel
that
that
three-pronged
test,
were
it
adopted
by
this
court,
reiterated
by
this
court,
would
certainly
summarize
a
fair
test
that
would
show
franchisees
that
you
are
not
different
from
sears
catalogue
or
from
volkswagen
or
from
any
other
person
who
does
business
in
this
country,
as
this
court
has
passed
for
years
and
years
on
the
issue.
you
have
to
go
find
the
franchise...
the
defendant,
where
the
defendant
was
found,
where
there
was
some
minimum
contact,
assuming,
of
course,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
tort,
but
in
a
contract
case,
you
have
got
to
go
where
there
is
some
minimum
contact.
that
law
applies
to
franchisees
as
well
as
it
applies
to
franchisors.
we
think
that
there
is
no
reason
why
burger
king
should
ask
this
court
to
adopt
a
new
philosophy
of
letting
them
for
the
sake
of
uniformity
and
national
consistency
sue
every
single
person
in
the
state
of
miami.
that
is
unfair,
and
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
what
that
will
mean,
it
will
mean,
and
burger
king
conceded
that,
perhaps
bringing
franchisees
from
foreign
countries
to
miami,
if
they
can
get
away
with
that,
to
sue
people
in
miami.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
fairness
that
we
think
the
constitution
contemplates.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
thank
you
very
much.
