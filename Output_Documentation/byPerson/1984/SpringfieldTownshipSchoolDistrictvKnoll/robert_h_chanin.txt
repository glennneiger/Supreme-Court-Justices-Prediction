mr.
robert
h.
chanin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
although
we
believe
that
this
case
can
and
should
be
decided
on
narrow
grounds,
the
petitioners
suggest
that
it
implicates
certain
broad
principles
set
forth
by
this
court
in
tomanio,
in
robertson,
and
other
cases.
accordingly,
we
think
it
is
appropriate
at
the
outset
to
make
clear
what
is
and
what
is
not
at
issue.
we
are
not
contending
that
a
state
statute
of
limitations
is
simply
a
technical
obstacle
to
be
circumvented
if
possible.
we
recognize,
as
this
court
indicated
in
tomanio,
that
in
most
cases
these
statutes
are
binding
rules
of
law.
nor
do
we
contend
that
a
state
statute
of
limitations
should
be
rejected
merely
because
it
would
cause
a
litigant
to
lose
the
lawsuit.
again,
we
recognize,
as
this
court
has
stated
in
robertson,
there
must
be
some
cutoff
point
in
most
cases,
and
inevitably
some
plaintiffs
will
fall
on
the
far
side
of
the
line.
we
make
a
much
more
focused
argument,
an
argument
that
fits
comfortably
within
the
framework
established
by
the
principles
set
forth
by
this
court
in
prior
cases.
what
we
are
contending
is
that
this
particular
pennsylvania
statute
of
limitations.
section
5527(b)(1),
should
not
be
borrowed
because
its
application
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
policy
underlying
section
1983.
that
policy,
as
this
court
has
made
clear
on
numerous
occasions,
most
recently
in
the
burnett
case
last
term,
is
to
augment
the
remedies
that
are
available
to
individuals
whose
federal
constitutional
or
statutory
rights
are
abridged
by
state
action.
our
argument--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--yes,
your
honor,
pennsylvania
courts
would
have
done
that.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
six
months.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
your
honor,
the
point
we
make
is
a
little
different
than
that.
we
indicate
that
the
pennsylvania
legislature
never
considered
this
type
of
action
when
it
passed
that
six-month
statute
of
limitations.
that
goes
to
the
nature
of
what
we
have
here,
what
kind
of
a
statute
of
limitations
we
have.
we
have
a
statute
of
limitations
that
is
exceptionally
short
by
any
standard,
six
months.
it
applies
only
to
suits
against
public
officials
as
compared
to
suits
not
only,
as
justice
white
has
asked,
against
private
employers,
but
it
does
not
apply
to
suits
against
the
government
as
an
entity.
and
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
a
residuary
statute.
it
applies
only
to
those
types
of
lawsuits
which
the
pennsylvania
legislature
considered
so
uncommon
or
so
unusual
that
they
did
not
make
subject
to
a
more
specific
statute
of
limitations.
the
point
we
make
at
the
footnote
is,
they
never
considered
this,
because
it
was
a
residuary
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
there
is
such
precedent
for
that.
indeed,
prior
to
this
case
there
was
a
variety
of
analogies
made
in
regard
to
employment
discrimination
cases
in
pennsylvania,
and
it
was
not
really
until
this
case
that
a
definitive
holding
was
made
that
those
cases
should
be
analogized
to
the
tort
of
injury
to
economic
rights.
prior
to
that,
there
were
cases
that
analogized
it
to
personal
injury
and
some
even
to
contracts.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
think
there
was
no
dispute
on
that
point,
your
honor.
i
think
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
pennsylvania
courts
would
have
applied
this
six-month
residuary
statute.
because
of
these
features
of
this
statute,
we
believe
that
this
court
can
decide
this
case
on
narrow
grounds.
it
need
not
reach
the
more
basic
question
of
six
months
per
se
is
too
short
for
instituting
a
1983
action.
quite
apart
from
the
answer
to
that
question,
it
would,
we
submit,
as
the
third
circuit
found
as
a
wholly
independent
ground
for
its
decision,
not
simply
because
six
months
was
unreasonably
short,
the
third
circuit
found
as
an
independent
ground
for
its
decision
that
the
application
of
this
statute
of
limitations
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
policies
underlying
section
1983.
let
me
begin
by
focusing
on
some
of
the
features
of
this
particular
statute.
to
begin
with,
six
months
is
an
abbreviated
time
limit
by
any
comparative
standard.
certainly
that
is
true
within
the
overall
limitations
schema
in
pennsylvania.
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
in
pennsylvania
that
requires
the
bringing
of
any
lawsuit
in
court
for
less
than
six
months,
and
there
are
only
three
other
statutes
of
limitations,
narrowly
focused
causes
of
action,
essentially
in
the
uniform
commercial
code
area,
which
have
a
six-month
statute.
even
for
those
actions
that
depend
most
heavily
on
conduct
and
unwritten
evidence,
such
as
assault,
or
slander,
or
personal
injury,
the
pennsylvania
legislature
has
established
minimum
statutes
of
limitations
of
one
year
and
up
to
six.
it
almost
never
drops
below
the
one-year
threshold.
and
there
is
a
similar
pattern
in
other
states.
it
is
extremely
rare
to
find
any
statute
of
limitations
below
one
year.
there
are
some
that
go
at
six
months,
but
invariably
they
are
uniform
commercial
code
actions
involving
highly
sophisticated
parties
on
both
sides.
in
sum,
what
we
have
here
is
an
abbreviated
statute
of
limitations
at
the
extreme
low
end
of
the
continuum,
and
it
should
be
noted
that
this
is
particularly
significant
because
we
have
a
residuary
statute.
in
most
states
residuary
statutes
run
five,
seven,
even
ten
years,
reflecting
a
broad
legislative
judgment
that
when
you
deal
with
the
unknown,
you
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
potential
plaintiff.
the
pennsylvania
legislature
in
this
statute
of
limitations
turns
that
presumption
on
its
head,
and
it
comes
up
with
a
residuary
statute
of
six
months.
the
second
relevant
feature
of
this
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--no,
we
are
suggesting
merely
to
characterize
six
months
as
atypical,
unusually
short,
it
is
in
any
event,
but
when
dealing
with
a
residuary
statute,
it
sticks
out
like
a
sore
thumb.
that
is
the
only
point
i
make
at
this
instance.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
yes,
my
research
indicates
some
20
of
them,
and
they
run
generally
four
to
ten
years.
the
second
feature
of
this
statute
of
limitations
is
that
it
applies
only
to
actions
brought
against
government
officials.
if
an
identical
employment
discrimination
action
such
as
respondent's
was
brought
against
a
private
employer,
the
plaintiff
would
have
six
years
in
which
to
file,
a
period
that
is
12
times
longer.
now,
i
suggest
that
on
its
face,
that
distinction
between
public
and
private
at
least
suggests
that
this
statute
is
inconsistent
with
the
policy
underlying
1983,
and
it
certainly
warrants
a
careful
investigation
of
the
purpose
of
the
pennsylvania
legislature
in
enacting
it.
that
investigation
leaves
no
doubt
as
to
the
purpose.
from
1772
until
<nineteen
seventy-eight>
[=
1978],
pennsylvania
had
a
six-month
statute
of
limitations
for
actions
brought
against
a
justice
of
the
peace
or
a
constable.
the
purpose
of
that
abbreviated
time
period
was
expressly
stated.
its
purpose
was,
and
i
quote,
"to
insulate
those
officials
from
vexatious
actions
brought
against
them.
"
that
statute
of
limitations
was
generalized
in
1978
to
become
the
residuary
statute
that
applies
to
actions
against
government
officials,
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
statute
of
limitations
now
before
this
court
is
the
extension
of
that
1772
statute,
and
it
seems
equally
clear
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
pennsylvania
legislature
in
1978.
it
was
to
extend
to
all
public
officials
the
same
protection
it
had
given
for
200
years
to
justices
of
the
peace
and
to
constables,
to
protect
all
public
officials
from
"vexatious
actions
that
might
be
brought
against
them.
"
in
burnett
v.
grattan
last
term,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
when
a
state,
as
here,
abbreviates
a
statute
of
limitations
to
protect
public
officials
from
actions
that
might
be
brought
against
them,
indeed,
to
restrict
the
remedies
available,
that
that
purpose
is
inconsistent
with
section
1983,
and
the
federal
court
should
look
elsewhere
in
state
law
to
find
a
statute
of
limitations
to
borrow.
we
do
not
understand
the
petitioners
to
quarrel
with
that
basic
proposition.
they
attempt
instead
to
get
around
it,
and
they
do
that
by
suggesting
other,
presumably
more
acceptable
state
policies
that
might
have
prompted
the
pennsylvania
legislature.
they
cite
in
their
brief
the
high
turnover
of
public
officials.
that
requires
prompt
initiation.
to
safeguard
the
efficacy
of
factfinding.
to
avoid
payment
of
two
salaries.
to
deter
unlawful
conduct
by
promptly
exposing
defalcations,
and
an
argument
we
have
just
heard,
another
reason,
to
enable
the
state
to
budget
more
effectively
and
efficiently.
although
we
do
not
concede
that
those
policies
would
in
any
event
justify
this
type
of
six-month
statute,
we
need
not
debate
the
point
here,
because
there
are
two
other
features
of
this
statute
which
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
those
could
not
possibly
have
been
the
policies
which
motivated
the
pennsylvania
legislature.
all
of
those
suggested
policies,
safeguarding
factfinding,
the
turnover
of
public
officials,
et
cetera,
are
just
as
relevant
to
a
lawsuit
brought
against
government
as
an
entity
as
they
are
when
brought
against
a
public
official.
indeed,
i
would
suggest
they
are
more
relevant,
because
what
they
go
to
is
the
ability
of
government
to
function
as
government,
the
capacity
of
government
to
defend
itself.
so,
if
anything,
they
should
apply
more
to
a
suit
against
government
as
an
entity.
and
yet
it
is
conceded
in
this
case
that
if
this
very
same
suit
were
against
a
government
entity,
the
filing
time
would
be
12
times
as
long,
six
years
instead
of
six
months.
the
remaining
feature
of
this
statute
of
limitations
that
is
relevant
here
is
that
it
is
a
residuary
statute
of
limitations.
it
applies
only
to
those
actions
that
the
1978
pennsylvania
legislature
could
not
identify,
those
uncommon
actions,
and
two
conclusions
emerge
from
this.
if
the
purpose
of
the
pennsylvania
legislature
was
the
types
of
things
that
petitioner
has
suggested,
to
protect
factfinding,
better
budgeting,
high
turnover
of
officials,
why
would
the
pennsylvania
legislature
limit
the
six-month
statute
to
those
unknown
and
uncommon
actions
and
allow
a
one,
a
two,
and
a
four-year
statute
of
limitations
for
the
actions
that
are
most
commonly
brought
against
public
officials?
indeed,
if
this
were
a
contract
claim,
which
would
involve
all
those
relevant
factors,
two
people
claiming
an
office,
budgeting,
the
pennsylvania
legislature
expressly
said,
four-year
statute
of
limitations.
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
residuary
statute
is
significant
in
another,
more
basic
respect,
a
respect,
i
suggest,
that
goes
to
the
whole
purpose
of
borrowing
under
section
1988,
and
the
reasons
that
this
court
has
understood
as
why
congress
has
asked
for
such
borrowing.
the
rationale
for
borrowing
under
1988
reflects
a
deference
to
the
judgment
of
state
legislatures.
the
federal
courts
in
effect
rely
on
the
balance
struck
by
a
state
legislature
between
the
need
to
protect
the
assertion
of
valid
claims
on
the
one
hand
and
the
need
to
protect
stale
actions
being
brought
on
the
other.
the
presumption
is
that
the
state
legislature
has
weighed
these
interests,
and
after
weighing
them
has
come
up
with
a
cutoff
point
that
reflects
the
balance.
the
petitioners
rely
very
heavily
on
this,
and
they
sprinkle
their
brief
with
such
phrases
as
"the
considered
judgment
of
the
state
legislature.
"
"the
state's
wisdom
in
setting
a
limit.
"
"the
legislature
took
into
account
the
burdens
borne
by
the
party.
"
i
suggest,
your
honors,
that
this
reliance
is
totally
misplaced
when
we
are
dealing
with,
as
here,
a
residuary
statute.
by
definition
there
has
not
been
this
type
of
analysis.
there
has
been
no
weighing
of
competing
interests.
there
has
been
no
consideration
of
the
practicalities
of
litigation.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
would
make
a
different
argument
leading
to
the
same
conclusion,
that
it
should
be
struck
down,
probably
slightly
more
quickly
than
the
one
that
is
before
you
right
now.
i
think
that
type
would
be
discriminatory.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
would
still
say
it
should
be
struck
down,
and
i
would
rely
heavily
on
burnett.
i
think
what
you
would
still
have
would
be
an
abbreviated
statute
of
limitations
that
is
abbreviated
precisely
for
the
reasons
this
court
found
unacceptable
in
burnett.
it
is
being
abbreviated
to
restrict
the
remedies
against
public
officials,
to
restrict
the
remedies
that
1983
was
designed
to
augment.
i
would
say
that
type
of
a
statute
should
be
struck
down
on
that
ground.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well,
you
reach
a
point.
if
we
have
a
statute
that
equally
treats
private
and
public,
government
entity,
public
officials
equally,
i
think
you
reach
a
point
where
it
is
not
sufficiently
abbreviated,
and
then
we
would
have
to
deal
with
the
question
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
in
this
case:
what
is
an
unreasonably
short
period
of
time
for
1983
actions?
when
you
ask
me
about
one
year,
two
years,
it
is
a
difficult
question.
fortunately,
it
is
one
i
don't
have
to
address
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
i
can
conceive
of
circumstances,
pursuing
your
hypothetical,
where
we
would
have
no
quarrel.
the
quarrels
we
have
in
this
case
are
because
this
statute
does
virtually
everything
wrong,
everything
that
we
think
this
court
has
said
it
should
not
do.
so,
my
final
point,
your
honors,
would
be,
this
is,
unlike
what
you
suggest,
justice
stevens,
a
residuary
statute,
and
obviously
there
was
no
balancing,
there
was
no
consideration
of
the
practicalities.
the
intent
of
the
pennsylvania
legislature
was
very
clear.
it
was
to
give
to
all
public
officials
what
for
200
years
it
had
given
to
constables
and
justices
of
the
peace.
its
purpose,
pure
and
simple,
was
to
protect
those
people
form
"vexatious
actions
that
might
be
brought
against
them.
"
we
submit
that
that
is
a
purpose
which
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
policies
underlying
section
1983.
it
should
not
be
borrowed,
and
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
