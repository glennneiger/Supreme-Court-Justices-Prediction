mr.
charles
potash
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
squarely
presents
to
the
court
the
question
whether
a
state
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
the
commencement
of
judicial
proceedings
should
be
disregarded
in
a
section
1983
suit
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
limitation
period,
six
months,
is
per
se
unreasonably
short,
and
consequently
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
respondent
commenced
suit
on
april
21st,
1981,
to
redress
alleged
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
by
her
employer,
the
school
district
of
springfield
township.
one
of
her
claims
sought
relief
under
section
1983.
in
the
alternative,
respondent
sought
relief
under
section
703
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
under
her
theory,
the
last
act
of
discrimination
occurred
in
september
of
1980,
some
seven
or
eight
months
earlier,
when
a
man
was
appointed
as
assistant
superintendent,
a
job
for
which
she
had
not
applied.
the
school
district
defendants
moved
for
summary
judgment,
one
of
the
grounds
being
that
the
section
1983
claim
was
barred
by
the
pennsylvania
state
statute
of
limitations
governing
certain
actions
against
public
officials.
the
district
court
agreed.
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
panel
decision
reversed
the
dismissal
of
the
1983
claim
on
the
ground
that
the
six-month
statute
of
limitations
was
so
short
as
to
be
inherently
inconsistent
with
the
policies
fostered
by
the
civil
rights
act.
the
school
district
defendants
applied
for
rehearing,
and
the
application
was
denied,
with
four
judges
voting
to
grant
the
rehearing.
now,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
statute
at
issue
was
properly
identified
as
the
most
appropriate
state
statute
of
limitations.
therefore
the
question
left
for
resolution
is
what
the
court
labeled
in
the
recent
case
of
burnett
versus
cratton
as
the
third
step
in
a
section
1983
inquiry,
that
is,
is
the
state
statute
inconsistent
with
federal
law?
i
submit
that
this
inquiry
should
be
confined
to
a
determination
whether
the
state
statute
discriminates
against
federal
rights
or
provides
so
short
a
time
so
as
to
effectively
preclude
litigating
a
civil
rights
claim.
it
is
clear
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
does
not
directly
conflict
with
the
civil
rights
act.
the
statute
does
not
discriminate
against
federal
claims.
it
was
not
enacted
with
any
intent
to
discriminate
against
federal
claims,
nor
is
there
any
hostility
toward
any
civil
rights
action.
it
applies
to
both
state
and
federal
claims.
a
more
cogent
reason
is
found
in
the
holding
of
the
third
circuit
which
held
it
was
the
analogous
statute
of
limitations.
implicit
in
this
finding
was
that
the
state
and
federal
law
claims
were
being
treated
equally.
here
there
is
no
basis
for
rejection
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
discriminates
against
federal
civil
rights
actions.
the
six-month
statute
of
limitations
at
issue
in
this
case
is
one
expressly
applicable
to
the
commencement
of
judicial
proceedings
rather
than
administrative
proceedings.
the
limitation
period
applies
to
judicial
remedies
enforceable
in
court
in
the
first
instance.
it
does
not
limit
who
may
bring
suit.
it
does
not
preclude
money
damages
or
injunctive
relief.
for
these
reasons,
its
enactment
should
raise
a
presumption
that
the
legislature
took
into
account
the
burden
of
the
parties
to
the
suit
governed
by
the
limitation,
and
the
practicalities
involved
in
litigating
civil
rights
claims,
and
found
the
limitation
period
to
be
a
reasonable
one.
the
determination
of
the
pennsylvania
legislature
that
a
six-month
period
is
a
reasonable
one
within
which
to
commence
litigation,
whether
in
a
state
or
federal
court,
is
given
support
by
the
holding
of
the
court
in
delcostello
versus
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters.
that
case
impliedly
recognized
that
a
six-month
limitation
period
was
sufficient
for
the
commencement
of
relatively
complex
federal
litigation.
that
case
cuts
across
any
conclusion
that
the
practicalities
of
litigation
necessarily
mean
that
a
six-month
period
is
an
unreasonable
time
in
which
to
bring
a
federal
cause
of
action.
an
inquiry
into
the
record
of
this
case
would
disclose
no
basis
for
finding
that
the
six-month
limitation
period
was
unreasonable.
in
this
case,
the
type
of
injury
alleged,
its
magnitude
and
consequence,
the
denial
of
appointment
to
a
higher
position,
and
the
consequent
loss
of
increased
pay,
benefits,
and
opportunities
for
future
advancement
should
have
been
immediately
recognized.
in
a
case
such
as
this,
the
degrees
and
certificates
held
by
each
applicant,
as
well
as
their
relative
experience
is
a
matter
of
public
record,
and
therefore
the
individual
knows
or
should
have
known
the
merit
of
his
credentials
or
her
credentials
relative
to
other
applicants
in
the
election
process.
finally,
arguments
that
the
six-month
period
is
unreasonable
also
fail
when
balanced
against
the
state
policies
sought
to
be
fostered
by
state
statutes
of
limitations,
policies
which
have
long
been
recognized
as
fundamental
to
a
well-ordered
judicial
system,
whether
state
or
federal.
here,
because
state
and
local
governments
are
more
likely
to
experience
frequent
changes
in
personnel
than
other
employers,
prompt
assertion
of
claim
is
important.
because
public
officials'
continued
service
is
subject
to
the
will
of
the
electorate,
or
if
they
be
appointed,
to
the
discretion
of
elected
officials,
even
a
short
passage
of
time
may
result
in
the
departure
of
persons
with
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
claim.
this
in
turn
would
impair
the
accuracy
of
the
factfinding
process.
mr.
charles
potash
no,
your
honor.
the
statute
of
limitations
against
private
employers
would
be
the
six-month
statute
of
limitations.
there
is
a
distinction.
this
is
a
statute
of
limitations
which
requires
that
the
commencement
of
the
action
be
brought
within
six
months.
mr.
charles
potash
against
a
public
official.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
potash
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
potash
that
would
be
six
years,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
potash
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
there
is
a--
mr.
charles
potash
--well,
under
the...
the
whole
statutory
scheme,
yes,
your
honor,
but
not
this
provision,
but
there
is
a
legitimate,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
legitimate
interest
that
the
state
has
in
having
the
matter
brought
to
light,
a
discrimination
matter
brought
to
light
very,
very
quickly.
the
interest
of
the
state
would
be
that
the
matter
be
brought
quickly
so
that
corrective
action
could
be
taken.
perhaps
a
public
official
could
be
removed
if
he
participated
or
continued
unlawful
conduct.
in
the
event
that
the
unlawful
conduct
is
against
an
appointed
official,
that
appointed
official
could
be
removed
immediately.
if
it
was
against
an
elected
public
official,
the
public
could
remove
that
individual
from
office
at
the
next
election.
the
prompt
assertion
of
these
claims,
i
think,
your
honor,
fosters
deterrence
and
fosters
remedial
action,
and
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
interest
that
the
state
has
in
that
distinction
that
is
made
between
the
application
of
the
statute
of
limitations
to
a
public
official
as
opposed
to
a
private
employer.
mr.
charles
potash
yes,
your
honor,
the
opinion
of
the
court
referred
to
it;
however,
it
did
not
consider,
i
believe,
the
argument
that
i
am
making.
i
believe
the--
mr.
charles
potash
--it
made
reference
to
that
in
its
opinion,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
the
appellate
court
just
felt
that
a
six-month
period
was
just
per
se
unreasonably
short.
mr.
charles
potash
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
specifically
with
respect
to
cases--
mr.
charles
potash
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
potash
somewhat,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
potash
it
might,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
this
court,
if
it
adopts
the
fact
that
the
appellate
court
must
first
characterize
the
nature
of
the
action,
and
then
refer
to
the
state
statutes
of
limitations,
it
might
affect
the
outcome
of
this
case.
i
believe,
however,
that
section
1988,
which
distinguishes
my
case
from
the
case
following,
would
direct
that
the
court
consider
the
wisdom
of
the
pennsylvania
legislature
in
regard
to
the
specific
provision
pertaining
to
public
officials.
we
are
past
the
second
stage,
because
this
has
been
already
determined
to
be
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations.
i
believe
that
the
case
following
me,
that
question
still
has
to
be
addressed.
mr.
charles
potash
yes,
your
honor,
it
could.
mr.
charles
potash
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
we
could
have
different
rules
in
each
forum,
and
i
believe
that
the
first
consideration
that
the
federal
court
would
have
to
make
is
to
determine
what
is
the
analogous
statute
of
limitations,
so
therefore
it
may
very
well
be...
as
to
what
characterizes
the
type
of
action
may
very
well
determine
whether
that
state
statute
or
that
state
holding
would
be
followed.
in
the
case,
if
i
recall
correctly,
that
follows
me,
the
state
supreme
court
did
characterize
the
action
one
way,
and
the
federal
court
was
attempting
to
characterize
it
another
way.
i
do
not
believe,
however,
and
perhaps
this
is
not
directly
in
answer
to
your
question,
that
uniformity
is
a
requirement.
as
far
as
uniformity
as
far
as
the
country
is
concerned,
or
uniformity
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
i
think
that
what
section
1988
says
is
that...
or
when
it
was
passed
by
congress,
congress
understood
or
contemplated
that
there
would
be
no
uniformity.
mr.
charles
potash
yes,
if
the
facts
are
identical.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
potash
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
potash
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
potash
legislature
are
public
officials.
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe.
mr.
charles
potash
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
potash
specifically
with
respect
to
cases
involving
discrimination
in
the
hiring
or
promotion
of
public
employees,
each
day
of
delay
in
commencing
suit
further
establishes
a
person
who
was
hire
or
promoted
in
the
place
of
a
complainant
in
his
or
her
position,
and
entitles
a
hired
or
promoted
person
to
compensation,
seniority,
tenure,
and
due
process
rights.
thus
in
the
event
that
the
public
employee's
conduct
is
ultimately
found
to
be
discriminatory,
government
service
may
be
substantially
disturbed.
that
again,
your
honor,
i
may
point
out,
is
a
legitimate
reason
for
the
distinction
between
the
statute
of
limitations
which
may
apply
to
a
public
official
and
to
a
private
employer.
two
salaries
may
be
required
to
be
paid
for
a
single
service,
and
the
public
employer
and
the
hired
or
promoted
employee
would
have
to
commence
the
process
of
undoing
that
which
was
the
initial
decision.
mr.
charles
potash
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
is
also
a
legitimate
concern
regarding
the
public
official
because
we
are
dealing
with
the
compensation
that
might
be
due
the
injured
individual.
we
are
dealing
with
the
fact
that
the
public
employer
may
have
to
budget,
may
have
to
make
certain
financial
considerations
which
the
private
employer
might
not
have.
the
public
employer
may
rely
on
taxation,
and
have
to
in
preparing
his
budget
prepare
for
the
eventuality
that
there
may
be
a
finding
that
the
action
was
discriminatory,
and
therefore
would
have
to
provide
some
how
or
some
way
from
the
tax
revenues
rather
than
the
private
employer,
who
has
his
own
private
resources
or
the
resources
of
the
private
enterprise.
mr.
charles
potash
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
charles
potash
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
the
public
employer
does
have
to
answer
for
the
tax
measures
that
he
raised,
the
budgetary
requirements
that
he
has.
mr.
charles
potash
the
private
employer
may
only
have
to
answer
to
himself,
not
to
the
public
at
large.
most
significantly,
however,
the
prompt
assertion
of
claims
by
the
filing
of
complaints
of
discrimination
on
the
public
record
would
foster
deterrence
of
unlawful
conduct
by
public
officials
in
addition
to
putting
the
governing
body
on
early
notice.
the
government
body
or
the
public
employer
can
take
corrective
measures.
prompt,
well-founded
accusations
against
public
officials
for
discrimination
in
hiring
or
promotion
on
the
basis
of
sex
would
increase
the
likelihood
that
they
would
be
accountable
for
their
violations
of
the
federal
rights
of
others.
if
they
are
elected
officials,
and
if
the
public
knows
of
their
conduct,
it
can
respond
at
the
next
election
by
voting
them
out
of
office.
if
appointed
officials
are
accused,
the
public
body
appointing
them
can
respond
by
removing
them
from
office.
absent
prompt
assertion
of
employment
discrimination
claims,
no
such
sanction
would
be
imposed
upon
the
responsible
public
officials,
who
in
turn
could
continue
to
practice
on
notice,
and
it
is
these
three
public
policy
considerations,
i
believe,
that
are
far
more
significant
than
perhaps
the
policy
considerations
to
which
i
have
just
referred.
i
believe
that
the
legislative
intent
which
can
be
deduced
from
the
language
of
this
statute
is
the
obligation
that
the
public
employer
feels
that
it
must
take
corrective
action,
that
it
must
remove
or
somehow
curb
the
abuse
of
state
power,
and
this
statute
of
limitations
accomplishes
that.
mr.
charles
potash
the
effect
would...
your
honor,
the
shorter
the
statute
of
limitations
would
affect
have
a
greater
curb
on
the
perpetuation
perhaps
of
the
unlawful
conduct.
mr.
charles
potash
however--
mr.
charles
potash
--however,
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying,
that
the
facts
in
this
case,
in
the
ordinary
employment
discrimination
case,
a
six-month
period
is
not
unreasonably
short.
i
am
saying
that
the
quicker
that
it
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
public
employer,
the
public
employer
has
the
interest,
the
interest
that
he
must
perform
as
a
public
employer,
of
remedying
this
situation,
and
the
six-month
statute
of
limitations
accompanies
that.
i
do
not
believe,
and
the
other
thrust
of
my
argument
is,
is
that
the
six-month
period
is
not
per
se
unreasonably
short.
mr.
charles
potash
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
charles
potash
yes,
but
not
for
actions
judicially
enforceable.
mr.
charles
potash
thank
you.
mr.
charles
potash
yes,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
i
would
like
to
comment
just
on
two
points
made
by
my
opponent.
firstly,
in
the
action
against
the
public
official,
as
distinguished
from
the
action
against
the
body,
the
public
body,
the
public
body
does
have
other
defenses
it
can
raise.
there
is
sovereign
immunity.
there
is
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
there
is
the
monell
doctrine,
and
so
on.
as
to
the
preamble,
which
my
opponent
has
also
cited,
that
preamble
was
stricken,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
was
the
purpose
for
enacting
the
six-month
statutory
period
which
was
part
of
the
limitation
scheme
adopted
in
the
revision
and
codification
of
all
the
statutes
of
limitations
and
all
the
statutes
applicable
to
judicial
proceedings
in
1978.
a
clear
reading
of
the
language
of
the
statute
would
support
a
reasonable
explanation
which
i
presented
to
this
court.
