rehnquist
but
surely
there
ought
to
be
uniformity
as
to
a
single
case.
justice
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
1988
has
very
expansive
provisions
for
reference
to
state
law,
but
isn't
the
ultimate
question
of
what
is
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
nonetheless
a
federal
one
in
light
of...
it
is
a
construction
of
1988?
justice
rehnquist
so
then
really
if
a
state
court
held
contrary
to...
held
one
way
as
to
the
statute
of
limitations
after
that
had
gone
through
the
state
system
if
that
question
were
preserved
a
person
could
seek
certiorari
here
because
that
is
a
federal
question.
justice
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
true
in
the
case
of
a
private
employer,
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
latter
is
an
impermissible
judgment
for
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
make?
justice
rehnquist
most
states
have
residuary
statutes
at
a
different
end
of
the
time
spectrum.
