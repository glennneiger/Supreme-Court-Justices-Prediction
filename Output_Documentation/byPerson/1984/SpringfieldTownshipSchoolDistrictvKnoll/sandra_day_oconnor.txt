justice
o'connor
mr.
chanin,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
pennsylvania,
had
the
claim
been
filed
in
the
pennsylvania
court,
would
have
applied
the
six-month
residual
statute
of
limitations
period?
justice
o'connor
your
argument--
--six
years.
justice
o'connor
--in
your
brief
in
note
9
indicated
that
you
thought
the
pennsylvania
legislature
never
intended
the
six-month
statute
to
apply.
justice
o'connor
isn't
there
some
precedent
in
the
state
and
the
federal
courts
sitting
in
pennsylvania
for
the
proposition
that
it
should
have
been
treated
as
a
breach
of
implied
contract
claim?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
really
looked
into
the
question
of
what
the
applicable
statute
should
be
had
the
action
been
brought
in
pennsylvania?
