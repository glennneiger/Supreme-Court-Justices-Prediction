does
the
same
statute
or
does
the
same
kind
of
a
statute
apply
to

actions
against
private
employers?
justice

against
a

employer.
justice
white
how
about
against
private?
justice
white
what
about...
what
is
the
statute
of
limitations
if
you
sue
a
private
concern
for
discrimination?
justice
white
six
years.
what
is
the
explanation
for
that?
justice
white
they
would
be
suits
under
the
same
statute,
i
suppose.
justice
white
did
the
court
below
make
anything
of
this
difference
between
suits
against
public
employers
and
against
private--
justice
white
--would
it
have
rejected
this
six-month
statute
solely
on
the
ground
that
it
was
so
much
shorter
than
the
limitations
period
applicable
to
private
employers?
justice
white
do
you
think
that
its
judgment
that
six
months
was
too
short
was
really
the
ground
for
its
decision?
