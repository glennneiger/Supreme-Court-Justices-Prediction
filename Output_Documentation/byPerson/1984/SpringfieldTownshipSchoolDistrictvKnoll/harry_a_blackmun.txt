justice
blackmun
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
blackmun
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
that
will
be
heard
next?
justice
blackmun
if
the
court
in
that
case
should,
and
i
am
not
saying
it
will,
but
if
it
should
affirm
the
tenth
circuit
in
that
case,
will
it
have
a
hearing
on
this
one,
in
your
opinion?
justice
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
one
more.
a
1983
case,
your
case
could
have
been
brought
in
state
court,
couldn't
it?
justice
blackmun
and
then
suppose
the
state
court
says
six
months
is
it,
and
the
federal
court
in
a
similar
case
says,
no,
it
isn't
six
months.
does
the
state
court
have
to
follow
the
federal
determination,
or
can
we
have
different
rules
for
each
forum?
justice
blackmun
for
administration
claims,
yes.
justice
blackmun
all
right.
