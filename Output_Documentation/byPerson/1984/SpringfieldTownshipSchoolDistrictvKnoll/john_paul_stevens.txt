do
you
assume
a
private
employer
has
infinite
resources?
justice

i
don't
understand
why
that
is
a
difference
then.
doesn't
he
also
have
to
budget
for
contingent
liabilities?
justice

a
private
employer
has
to
answer
to
his
stockholders,
and
he
has
to
decide
what
prices
to
charge.

potash,
may
i
just
ask
this?
your
argument
seems
to
boil
down
to
the
notion
that
the
shorter
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
greater
the
deterrent
value
of
the
underlying
cause
of
action.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
stevens
--go
ahead.
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
counsel,
do
you
know
of
any
federal
statute
that
has
as
short
a
period
as
six
months
for
this
kind
of
a
claim?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question?
supposing
you
did
have
the
kind
of
weighing
that
you
say
did
not
take
place
here,
and
the
pennsylvania
legislature
had
hearings
on
1983
litigation
and
concluded
that
for
the
most
part
they
are
quite
a
burden
on
the
state
and
they
really
are
not
meritorious
except
in
a
minority
of
the
cases,
and
deliberately
passed
a
statute
that
said
in
all
1983
litigation
the
statute
of
limitation
will
be
six
months,
whether
the
state
is
brought
in
state
or
federal
court.
would
you
make
the
same...
what
would
your
view
be
of
such
a
statute?
justice
stevens
well,
they
say
1983
or
claims
based
on
the
pennsylvania
constitution
as
well.
justice
stevens
and
that
would
be
even
if
it
was,
say,
a
year
or
two
years?
justice
stevens
i
am
assuming
a
time
that
would
not
be
per
se
unreasonably
short.
that
is
all.
i
am
just
wondering
if
a
state
legislature
could
recognize
all
the
confusion
in
the
courts
about
1983
litigation
and
just
try
and
enact
a
1983
statute
of
limitations
in
the
interest
of
certainty,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
as
well
as
cutting
it
down.
