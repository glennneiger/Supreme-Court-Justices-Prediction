justice
white
but
surely
it
was
authorized
to
do
so,
wasn't
it?
mr.
covelli:
no,
your
honor.
you
don't
think
so?
justice
white
well,
here's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said:
our
conclusion
that
the
state
policy
authorizes
the
city
to
do
so
and
so.
now,
you
disagree
with
that.
justice
white
well,
doesn't
that
depend
on
a
reading
of
the
state
statutes?
justice
white
should
we
try
to
second-guess
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
on
how
the
state
statute
should
be
read?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
i
asked
you
if
they
authorized
the
city
to
do
it.
perhaps
the
state
didn't
declare
a
state
policy
that
the
municipalities
had
to
follow.
but
didn't
they...
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals,
they
at
least
authorized
the
city
to
displace
competition
if
they
wanted
to.
justice
white
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
this
particular
point,
and
what
if
we
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
state
has
authorized
the
cities
to
do
that?
would
you
say
that
you
lose
the
case,
or
do
you
think
that
the
state
must
compel
all
the
cities
to
do
it?
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
city
was
also
authorized,
certainly,
to
provide
the
service
if
they
annexed
the
property.
justice
white
well,
did
you
make
this
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
why
didn't
they
address
it?
justice
white
you
say
the
state
must
express
an
affirmative
policy
that
it
wants
followed.
justice
white
so
you
really
think
the
municipality
has
to
be,
in
effect,
ordered
to
institute
this
policy.
justice
white
well,
you
just...
you
not
only
disagree
with
your
opponent,
but
with
the
solicitor
general
in
this
regard.
justice
white
well,
what
if
in
listing
the
powers
it
had
said
a
home
rule
city
may,
if
it
wants
to...
but
it
doesn't
have
to...
monopolize
sewer
services?
justice
white
we
say
there's
no
real
difference
between
municipalities
and
non-governmental
units.
