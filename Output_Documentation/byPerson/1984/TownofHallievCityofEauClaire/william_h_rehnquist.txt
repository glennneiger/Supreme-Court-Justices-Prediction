justice
rehnquist
mr.
covelli,
you
say
"from
the
state's
statutes.
"
"do
you
mean
by
that
in
contradistinction
to
authoritative
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin?
"
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
didn't
mean
that
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin's
decision
on
whether
the
parker
v.
brown
exemption
applies
would
be
at
all
conclusive
in
this
litigation,
but
as
to
whether
there
is
a
state
policy,
could
not
one
look
as
well
to
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin's
decisions
construing
statutes,
as
well
as
to
the
statutes
themselves?
justice
rehnquist
but
supposing
the
state
court
decision
didn't
arise
in
an
antitrust
context,
but
in
some
other
context,
so
the
state
court
wouldn't
have
any
occasion
to
use
the
language
of
the
city
of
boulder
case.
don't
you
look
to
state
court
decision
as
well
as
to
statute
to
decide
what
the
policy
is?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
covelli,
let
me
read
you
the
first
five
lines
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
which
i
think
purports...
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
"four
towns
allege
that
a
city
is
using
a
monopoly
over
sewage
treatment
services
in
the
relevant
geographic
market
to
gain
a
monopoly
in
the
markets
for
sewage
collection
and
sewage
transportation,
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
"
is
that
a
reasonably
correct
statement
of
what
you
are
complaining
about?
justice
rehnquist
so
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
understood
the
nature
of
your
complaint.
justice
rehnquist
that's
right.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
covelli,
the
seventh
circuit
described
the
policy
it
thought
the
state
of
wisconsin
had
articulated
in
appendix
xiv
of
the
petition.
it
says:
"clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
state
policy
not
to
burden
municipalities
with
providing
services
unless
they
can
annex
the
territory
that
they
service.
"
now,
do
you
disagree
that
that
has
been
enunciated
as
wisconsin
state
policy?
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
seventh
circuit,
after
having
quoted
the
language
in
the
chippewa
falls
case,
which
refers
to
14407,
says
here
is
how
we
read
it.
you
say,
no,
i
read
it
differently.
ordinarily,
we
defer
to
the
judgement
of
the
circuit
courts
as
to
their
state
law
within
their
states.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
read
that
as...
that
language
i
just
quoted
doesn't
say
anything
like
that.
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
fischer,
i
think
your
opponent
says
that
even
if
the
wisconsin
legislature
passed
laws
saying
that
cities
may
monopolize,
that's
not
enough,
because
chippewa
falls
might
be
pro-competitive
and
eau
claire
might
be
monopolistic.
so
he
says
then
it's
just
up
to...
that
sort
of
a
statute
would
just
leave
it
up
to
the
city.
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
does
your
test
then
differ
from
just
blanket
home
rule
which
was
held
inadequate
in
boulder?
