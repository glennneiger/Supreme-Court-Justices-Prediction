mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
of
all
the
problems
faced
by
cities
today,
one
of
the
greatest
is
the
question
of
antitrust
exposure.
the
ultimate
question,
i
believe,
that
we
have
here
is
what
standard
will
the
court
and
should
the
court
establish
for
immunity?
so
far
we
know,
under
city
of
lafayette,
that
home
rule
authority,
or
that
cities
are
not
automatically
exempt
by
virtue
of
their
governmental
status.
boulder
tells
us
that
home
rule
authority
is
insufficient
to
confer
immunity.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
an
urgent
need
to
clarify
this
entire
area.
there
is
a
great
uncertainty
arising
out
of
the
parker
exemption
as
it
has
been
construed,
and
lafayette,
boulder,
and
then
then
the
midcal
case
as
well.
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
it
has,
to
a
certain
extent,
your
honor.
and
i
will
agree
with
my
worthy
opponent
that
it
does
not
moot
this
case.
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
that's
true.
the
legislation
would
not
affect
our
case
here,
nor
would
it
affect,
necessarily,
the
pending
cases
that
are
presently
existing.
and
i
think
the
appendix
of
the
national
institute
of
municipal
law
officers
brief
indicates
148
cases,
many
of
those
involving
substantial
damages.
those
would
not
necessarily
be
involved.
as
i
understand
it,
the
new
legislation
requires
a
consideration
of
the
equities
in
granting
relief
or
not
from
damages.
furthermore,
it
would
not
eliminate
the
availability
of
non-monetary
relief,
such
as
we
have
here,
which
i
would
suggest
may
have
equal
or
greater
consequences
for
municipalities.
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
we
would
hope
that--
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
--we
would
hope
that
we
would
not
have
to
seek
legislative--
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
--i
suppose,
theoretically,
that
would
be
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
no,
there
is
not.
there
is
not.
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
this
is
true.
the
legislature
could
pass
legislation
saying
that
the
municipality
may
have
a
monopoly
and
may
deal
with
sewer.
the
question
then
is
what
happens
with
police
and
fire,
water,
ambulance
service?
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
they
could.
we
feel
that
this
would
be
an
onerous
burden
on
municipalities
to
have
the
seek
state
legislation
in
each
and
every
instance.
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
i
guess
that
could
be
one
possible
result.
however--
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
--we
submit
that
to
require
the
cities
to
seek
legislation
in
all
possible
instances
would
be
a
burden
which
cities
should
not
bear.
and
i
think
this
position
is
supported
as
well
by
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
filed
on
our
behalf
by
nine
states
who
similarly
feel
the
same
way.
the
situation
then,
i
believe,
is
one
of
really
a
chilling
effect
on
municipal
activities.
there
is
a
great
concern
over
liabilities
and
the
responsibilities
under
the
antitrust
laws
which
are
uncertain
at
the
present
time.
i
will
agree
that
the
main
issue
is
how
specific
must
a
grant
of
authority
be
to
a
municipality
in
order
to
confer
immunity.
and
we
submit
that
the
seventh
circuit
test
is
a
valid
and
a
proper
test.
contrary
to
the
allegations
of
the
towns,
we
are
not
asking
for
a
repudiation
of
lafayette
and
boulder.
in
fact,
we
ask
the
court
to
apply
these
cases
through
the
standard
established
by
the
seventh
circuit.
and
we
submit
that
the
seventh
circuit
test
is
derived
directly
from
those
cases.
it
follows
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
clear
articulation
and
affirmative
expression
of
state
policy.
and
contrary
to
the
towns'
position,
the
cases
have
held
that
specific
and
detailed
authorization
is
not
necessary.
they,
i
believe,
take
the
opposite
position
that
there
has
to
be
specific
and
detailed
authorization.
your
precedents
say
that
this
is
not
required.
the
test,
i
believe,
and
i
think
has
been
indicated
during
prior
questioning
is
that...
did
the
legislature
contemplate
and
intend
the
anticompetitive
activity?
how
do
you
do
this?
you
take
a
look
at
the
state
law.
and
i
will
grant
justice
marshall's
position
that
if
you
had
a
specific
legislative
mandate
or
a
specific
legislative
act
that
said
that
the
municipality
may
monopolize,
that
would
be
sufficient.
however,
this
court's
precedents
do
not
require
that.
the
say
that
if
there
is
articulation
and
expression
of
a
policy,
that
this
is
adequate.
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
yes.
and
i
think
the
result
of
that
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
alternative
would
be
to
have
a
compulsion
test.
i
think
the
natural
result
of
that,
the
logical
conclusion
is
that
cities
would
have
to
be
compelled
by
the
legislature
to
take
whatever
action
they
are
to
take
to
become
immune.
i
don't
read
lafayette
and
boulder
as
saying
that
you
have
to
require
activity
by
a
municipality
for
it
to
be
immune
or
exempt.
and
i
think
that
mere
authorization
of
a
municipal
activity
is
sufficient
and
adequate.
merely
because
a
municipality
may
have
the
option
of
acting
pro-competitively
or
not
at
all
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
city
cannot
deal
with
the
matter.
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
in
boulder,
the
legislature
had
not
acted
specifically.
all
that
we
dealt
with
there
was
a
grant
of
home
rule
authority.
the
issue
there
was
whether
a
cable
television
moratorium
was
authorized.
the
colorado
constitution
said
that
municipalities
have
home
rule
authority
to
act
in
general
areas
of
concern.
there
was
no
specific
addressing
of
the
issue
of
cable
television.
in
that
case,
i
think
the
court
was
entitled,
and
logically
so,
to
find
that
there
was
no
specific
grant
of
authority.
there
was
no
authorization,
there
was
no
contemplation,
nor
could
there
be
said
to
be
one.
in
this
case,
it's
entirely
different
because
the
statutes
that
the
court
has
before
you,
the
wisconsin
law,
has
addressed
the
issue.
the
legislature
has
adopted
these
regulations.
and
they
specifically
address
the
conduct
of
the
city
which
is
in
question
here.
despite
the
town's
characterization
of
the
matter
at
hand,
i
think
the
issue
is
simply,
their
position
is
based
entirely
upon
the
city's
policy
not
to
extend
its
utility
services
outside
of
its
boundaries
without
annexation.
i
would
submit
that
if
we
did
not
have
such
a
policy,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
so
the
seventh
circuit
test,
we
would
submit,
balances
and
accommodates
both
state
sovereignty
and
the
antitrust
laws,
and
we
submit
that
it
should
be
upheld.
we
feel
that
it
fulfills
the
parker
test.
it
accommodates
state
sovereignty
in
that
it
gives
recognition
and
viability
to
the
state
laws
that
are
adopted
in
the
area.
now,
again,
the
colorado
and
wisconsin
situations
are
entirely
different.
under
the
parker
rationale,
the
rationale
of
that
is
to
preserve
state
sovereignty.
and
this
is
preserved.
the
state
action
is
immunized
from
antitrust
exposure.
the
town,
however,
i
think,
assumes
that
immunization
is
available
only
of
activity
which
is
compelled
and
not
authorized.
they
are
concerned
only
with
state
mandates
and
not
authorizations.
again,
here,
the
state
authorizes
but
does
not
compel
the
city
to
undertake
its
policy.
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
peculiar
for
a
state
to
take
an
action
mandating
and
directing
a
municipality
to
take
an
action
in
an
area
of
special
traditional
activity
such
as
this.
if
the
city
is
prevented
under
the
antitrust
laws
from
fixing
its
limits
of
utility
service,
then
we
would
suggest
the
state
law
authorizing
this
limitation
is
nullified
and
has
a
direct
impact
on
the
parker
v.
brown
exemption
and
the
theory
underlying
that
exemption.
i
think
as
evidence
of
this
is
the
town's
claim
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
city
can
comply
with
the
sherman
act
only
by
ignoring
state
law.
they
say
that
we
can
avoid
sherman
act
liability
by
agreeing
to
extend
our
utility
services
outside
of
our
boundary
or
divesting
ourselves
of
our
utility.
this,
of
course,
would
nullify
the
state
law
authorizing
the
cities
to
take
this
position,
and
i
think
indicates
that
it's
contrary
to
parker.
the
seventh
circuit
test,
on
the
other
hand,
upholds
this
and
recognizes
this
requirement.
now,
addressing
the
specific
state
statutes
which
have
been
mentioned,
again
the
basis
of
the
town's
claim
is
that
the
city
has
no
authority
to
adopt
the
policy
which
it
has.
again,
we
limit
our
sewer
service
to
our
boundaries.
we
are
not
trying
to
monopolize
anything
in
the
township.
we
confine
it
to
the
boundaries
alone,
and
we
extend
only
upon
annexation,
in
which
case
the
area
in
question
becomes
a
part
of
the
city,
and
the
city
then
serves
it.
mr.
frederick
w.
fischer
no.
it
has
to
be
contiguous
to
the
city,
your
honor.
and
it
also
has
to
be
approved
by
the
majority
of
the
owners
of
property
or
the
electors
in
the
area.
the
town's
complaint
mainly
is
that
the
city
has
decided
not
to
share
its
treatment
service
with
them
and
therefore
annexation
results.
and
i
think
this
is
evident
from
the
complaint.
we
are
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
i
understand,
but
the
complaint,
i
think,
in
itself
does
concede
this
point,
paragraph
14
of
the
complaint
specifically.
so
we
have
the
basic
statute,
<sixty-six
point
oh
six
nine
two
c@l>
[=
66.069(2)(c)]
which
explicitly
states
that
the
city
may
fix
the
limits
of
its
service
to
the
city
boundaries,
and
it
goes
further
than
that
to
say
that
it
has
no
obligation
to
serve
beyond
this
area.
this
again
is
plain
language,
and
it
answers
precisely
the
town's
complaint.
also,
as
evidence
of
state
authorization
contemplation
are
14407(1)
and
(1)(m).
under
sub
(1),
the
state,
through
its
dnr,
may
direct
the
city
to
extend
its
utility
service
outside
the
boundaries
to
the
adjacent
town.
under
(1)(m),
if
the
city
initiates
annexation
and
the
town
members
refuse
this
annexation,
then
the
dnr
order
is
voided
and
the
city
has
no
obligation
to
serve.
both
the
district
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
viewed
this
as
explicit
authority
for
the
city's
policy
and
evidence
of
legislative
contemplation
and
intent.
under
boulder,
the
statement
is
made
that
a
district
judge
should
look
at
all
evidence
of
contemplation.
this
is
indeed
evidence
of
contemplation.
the
town
of
hallie
v.
city
of
chippewa
falls
has
been
mentioned.
and
again,
although
i
will
concur
that
this
is
not
determinative
here,
because
we
are
dealing
with
federal
antitrust
laws,
it
does
provide
further
indication
as
to
state
contemplation.
there,
that
case
had
the
same
fact
situation
as
here,
involved
the
same
township,
the
town
of
hallie;
given
a
different
city,
but
the
same
township,
and
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
liability
under
the
state
antitrust
laws.
the
towns
nevertheless
take
issue
with
that
case,
saying
there
really
was
no
finding
that
wisconsin
expressed
any
policy
that
competition
be
displaced.
but
the
case
did
say
things
like
a
sewer
monopoly
was
more
appropriate
than
competition.
they
held
that
annexation
is
a
reasonable
quid
pro
quo
to
extending
service.
they
found
that
the
legislature
intended
that
sewer
service
may
be
tied
to
other
city
services,
and
they
found
that
the
legislature
did
not
intend
that
the
city
be
required
to
extend
sewer
service
extra-territorially.
as
justice
powell
said
in
the
midcal
case,
respectful
consideration
and
great
weight
must
be
given
to
the
views
of
the
state
courts
on
matters
of
state
law.
we
submit
that
the
chippewa
falls
case
adds
a
great
deal
of
interpretation
and
fleshes
out
the
statutes
that
are
already
in
existence.
the
town's
argument
goes
further,
to
say
that
the
state
must
approve
a
specific
anticompetitive
effect.
they
say
that
the
state
law
is
neutral
if
the
city
has
discretion
to
limit
or
not
to
limit
its
sewer
service.
in
essence,
their
argument
is
that
no
matter
what
the
legislature
may
have
intended
or
contemplated,
the
state
cannot
confer
discretion
on
its
local
governments
in
these
areas.
they
say,
and
i
think
the
logical
conclusion
of
their
argument
is
that
the
state
must
direct
the
anticompetitive
conduct
specifically.
we
submit
that
under
this
court's
precedence,
that
is
error
because
the
city
of
layfayette
and
the
city
of
boulder
have
set
a
legislative
contemplation
standard
for
local
governments.
those
cases
have
held
that
you
must
look
at
the
authority
granted
to
a
municipality
to
operate
in
a
particular
area.
from
that,
you
can
glean
legislative
intention
and
contemplation.
we
submit
that
the
statutes
in
existence
here
show
this
authorization
to
operate
and
to
formulate
the
basis
for
the
city's
policies.
the
towns
have
said
that
they
are
really
not
asking
for
a
compulsion
or
compelling
standard.
however,
i
think
their
sole
test
that
they
put
forth
for
this
court
to
adopt,
the
so-called
"necessarily
follows"
test
indicates
that
that
is
precisely
what
they
are
asking
for.
this
is
not
appropriate,
we
submit,
because
it's
contrary
to
lafayette
and
boulder.
they
claim
in
their
brief,
in
their
initial
brief,
that
the
v.
watson.
an
examination
of
that
shows
that
that
is
the
only
case
that
applies
such
a
test,
if
indeed
it
did
apply
it
in
that
case.
the
towns
would
formulate
the
"necessarily
follows"
test
to
mean
that
the
city's
action
must
necessarily
or
automatically
follow
from
the
exercise
of
city
discretion.
there
are
cases
after
parks
v.
watson,
however,
that
indicate
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
adopt
and
has
not
adopted
any
such
test.
the
case
of
golden
state
transit
followed
parks
v.
watson,
making
no
mention
to
the
case
of
parks
v.
watson
or
the
"necessarily
follows"
test.
and
a
month
ago,
three
recent
cases
were
decided
in
the
ninth
circuit,
again
making
no
mention
of
parks
v.
watson
or
the
"necessarily
follows"
test.
and
those
three
cases
are
springs
ambulance
v.
rancho
mirage;
hudson
&
associates
v.
cielo
vista;
and
catalina
cable
vision
associates
v.
city
of
tucson.
interestingly
enough,
the
springs
ambulance
and
the
catalina
cable
vision
cases
specifically
refer
to
the
town
of
hallie
decision
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
all
apply
a
legislative
contemplation
test.
we
submit
that
a
compulsion
or
direction
test
is
inappropriate.
first
of
all,
it
would
nullify
local
autonomy;
if
the
state
has
to
direct
a
municipality,
then
local
autonomy
really
goes
out
the
window.
in
addition,
to
require
the
state
to
direct
its
municipalities
would
be
an
intrusion
upon
the
sovereign
state,
again
contrary
to
parker
v.
brown.
furthermore,
the
state
could
not
delegate
discretion
if
it
wished
to
do
so
under
that
particular
test.
and
again,
that's
an
infringement
on
state
sovereignty,
we
submit.
the
towns
also
claim
that
cantor
v.
detroit
edison
should
apply
here.
again,
trying
to
bring
a
case
from
the
private
sector
into
the
public
sector,
again
to
require
that
the
city's
action
be
compelled
and
not
merely
authorized.
however,
the
example
here
that
we
have
before
us
is
strictly
public
governmental
activities
in
an
area
of
traditional,
basic
governmental
power.
the
towns,
nevertheless,
claim
that
there
really
should
be
no
difference
between
public
activity
and
private
activity
and
that
the
same
standards
should
apply
to
both.
however,
even
the
towns
acknowledge
a
distinction
for
the
purpose
of
applying
the
active
state
supervision
requirement
of
midcal,
and
they
do
seem
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
private
and
public
activity
for
that
purpose.
in
the
remaining
time,
i
would
like
to
address
the
issue
of
active
state
supervision
which
was
developed
in
midcal
and
is
claimed
to
have
application
here.
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
require
active
state
supervision
in
order
to
gain
exemption
in
this
case.
and
this,
i
would
submit,
is
consistent
with
the
other
circuit
courts
that
have
considered
this
issue.
these
are
shown
on
pages
41
and
42
of
the
city's
brief.
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
require
this
prong
of...
the
second
prong
of
midcal
here
because
it
found
it
was
unnecessary
and
unwise.
again,
even
the
towns
would
relax
this
requirement
where
a
local
government
is
involved.
first
of
all,
it
is
unnecessary
to
have
this
requirement.
in
midcal
where
the
requirement
was
enunciated,
that
involved
a
private
price-fixing
scheme
involving
private
wine
dealers.
there
was
a
need
to
have
continued
compliance
with
the
initial
grant
of
state
authority
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
state
action
as
opposed
to
private
action
was
being
authorized.
here,
we
have
a
totally
different
situation.
we
have
a
public
local
government
which
is
a
creature
of
the
state.
indeed,
in
cases
involving
sewer
utility
services
in
wisconsin,
the
state
supreme
court
has
characterized
it
that
the
city
is
actually
acting
as
an
arm
of
the
state.
the
city
in
this
context
is
always
subject
to
state
scrutiny
and
to
state
restraints.
if
the
state
sees
something
that
should
not
be
occurring,
it
can
always
step
in
and
take
action
to
stop
that.
this
is
not
like
a
public
business.
more
pointedly,
a
city
involved
in
a
traditional
function
such
as
we
are
here
is
not
motivated
by
profit,
unlike
the
wine
merchants
in
the
midcal
case.
the
city
engages
in
providing
sewer
service
to
provide
a
public
needed
service
to
its
residents.
it
is
not
motivated
by
trying
to
gain
profit
by
doing
so.
therefore,
a
pointed
reexamination
of
municipal
conduct
is
not
necessary
in
this
situation.
furthermore,
local
governments
are
subject
to
inherent
restraints
and
limitations.
one
general
concept
is
that
public
powers
can
be
exercised
only
for
public
purposes.
this
again
distinguishes
public
and
private
conduct
in
a
material
fashion.
to
require
active
state
supervision
over
municipalities
would
conflict
with
the
ability
of
the
state
to
delegate
discretionary
authority
to
its
municipalities.
we
would
become,
in
effect,
de
facto
state
agencies.
this
again
is
agreed
to
by
the
nine
amici
states
who
agree
that
the
second
prong
of
midcal
should
not
be
applied
to
the
municipalities,
especially
when
the
city
is
undertaking
a
traditional
municipal
function.
so
such
a
requirement
is
unnecessary.
the
seventh
circuit
also
found
that
it
was
unwise.
it
would
require
federal
courts
to
determine
not
only
whether
supervision
of
municipal
activity
exists,
but
whether
active
state
supervision
exists.
this
would
require
the
courts
to
involve
themselves
in
considerable
feats
of
interpretation
which
should
not
be
required.
furthermore,
it
would
require
the
state
to
actively
supervise
all
activities
of
a
myriad
of
local
governments,
keeping
in
mind
that
we're
not
only
dealing
here
with
sewer
service,
but
the
impact
of
this
case
will
have
an
effect
on
all
types
of
municipal
services.
the
state
could
either
do
that,
supervise,
or
it
could
undertake
the
function
by
itself.
the
states
are
reluctant
to
do
either,
as
evidenced
again
by
the
amicus
briefs
of
the
nine
states,
including
wisconsin
i
might
add.
finally,
and
i
think
most
importantly,
if
active
state
supervision
were
required,
this
would
result
in
the
erosion,
if
not
the
outright
discretion
of
local
autonomy
and
delegated
authority
which
has
been
historically
enjoyed
by
municipalities.
finally,
in
conclusion,
i
would
submit
that
the
only
thing
the
city
is
guilty
of
here
is
following
state
law.
the
state
authorized
the
city
to
adopt
the
policy
it
has
adopted.
despite
the
town's
contention,
this
is
the
basis
of
the
action
here,
and
we
suggest
that
the
city
should
be
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
for
doing
so.
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
thank
you.
