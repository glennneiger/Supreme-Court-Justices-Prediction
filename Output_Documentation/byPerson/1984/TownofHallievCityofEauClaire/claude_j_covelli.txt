mr.
claude
j.
covelli
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
action
arises
from
the
complaint
filed
by
four
towns
who
are
adjacent
to
the
city
of
eau
claire.
that
complaint
alleged
that
the
city
was
using
its
monopoly
power
over
sewage
treatment
services
in
the
relevant
geographic
market
to
monopolize
another
product
market,
sewage
collection
and
transportation
services.
originally,
other
than
the
sherman
act,
other
claims
were
made
at
the
trial
court
level.
the
relief
requested
in
the
complaint
was
strictly
injunctive
relief;
in
other
words,
to
stop
the
city
from
engaging
in
this
anticompetitive
conduct.
at
the
trial
court
level,
the
city,
pursuant
to
rule
12(b)(6)
moved
to
dismiss.
that
motion
was
granted.
as
to
the
antitrust
claims,
it
was
granted
on
parker
v.
brown
exemption
grounds.
only
the
antitrust
claim
was
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
again
on
parker
v.
brown
exemption
grounds.
there
are
three
issues
that
are
presented
in
this
case.
the
threshold
issue
is
what
showing
is
sufficient
to
establish
that
the
sovereign
state
has
clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
the
state
policy
that
the
competition
in
question
be
displaced
with
monopoly
service
or
regulation.
if
that
requisite
state
policy
is
determined
to
exist,
the
next
issue
is
what
showing
is
sufficient
to
establish
the
state
selected
the
city
to
implement
that
state
policy
with
the
particular
anticompetitive
conduct
in
question.
if
these
first
two
tests
are
met,
the
next
question
is
whether
active
state
supervision
is
necessary
to
assure
the
city's
anticompetitive
conduct
is
attributable
to
the
state.
the
parties
disagree
on
the
showings
under
all
three
issues.
however,
the
disagreement
is
fundamental
and,
i
believe,
determinative
as
to
the
first
issue.
the
town's
position
that
the
requirement
that
the
state
clearly
articulate
and
affirmatively
express
its
policy
decision
to
displace
competition
means
just
that.
it
means,
number
one,
that
the
evidence
of
that
policy
must
be
gleaned
from
the
state's
statutes.
it
means,
number
two,
that
these
statutes
must
clearly
evidence
that
the
state
has
addressed
the
displacement
of
competition.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
mean
this;
that
the
statutes
define
it.
the
legislative
statement
defines
it.
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court,
to
the
extent
they
apply
the
appropriate
test...
and
that
is
the
test
determined
by
this
court...
may
be
informative
to
the
court,
but
if
the
state
court
applies
a
different
standard
and
does
not
determine
that
these
statutes
do,
in
fact,
clearly
articulate
this
matter,
this
is
still
a
federal
question
and
it
is
something
to
be
decided
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
i
think
that
if
the
state
of
wisconsin
through
its
court
declared
that
we
find
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
its
particular
policy,
the
one
in
question,
that
may
be
of
some
guidance
to
this
court,
but
it
is
not
bound
by
that
decision.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
well,
i
think
it
is
very
unlikely
that
the
state
court
would
ever
address
the
issue
of
the
displacement
of
competition
and
replacing
it
with
monopoly
service
or
regulation
other
than
in
an
antitrust
situation.
i
think
also
in
this
case,
for
example,
although
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
addressed
this
type
of
conduct,
it
is
clear
from
the
decision
in
chippewa
falls
case
that
the
supreme
court,
number
one,
expressly
said
we
are
not
applying
the
parker
test.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
also
had
its
own
rule,
that
although
not
as
stringent
as
the
parker
test,
approached
it.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said
we
are
not
applying
that
test
either.
when
you
look
at
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
decision,
what
they
said
was,
relying
on
home
rule
power,
not
completely,
almost
completely,
this
conduct
is
not
prohibited
by
state
law;
this
conduct
is
not
prohibited
by
wisconsin's
mini-sherman
act.
we
submit
that
that
is
the
same
as
in
boulder;
that
that
is
state
neutrality;
that
the
state
court,
the
state
law
does
not
have
to
prohibit
the
anticompetitive
conduct.
this
court
has
decided
that
the
federal
antitrust
laws
apply
to
municipalities
and
the
federal
antitrust
laws
prohibit
anticompetitive
conduct
of
these
municipalities.
so
i
guess
if
the
state
court
hit
and
applied
the
exact
test
by
this
court,
this
court
would
not
be
bound
by
it.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
would
not
say
that
the
court
should
totally
disregard
it.
i
think
the
court
has
to
make
its
own
decision,
based
on
its
own
tests,
and
what
the
legislature
has
said
and
what
the
legislature
has
intended.
so
i
think
the
statute
must,
number
one,
evidence
that
the
state
legislature
has
clearly
addressed
the
displacement
of
competition,
and
then,
two,
under
the
test
has
clearly
articulated
its
policy
decision...
that
is,
the
state's...
to
displace
that
competition
with
monopoly
service
or
regulation.
after
outlining
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
thrust
of
our
argument
will
simply
be
this:
that
the
clear
articulation
test
is
the
correct
test;
that
it
serves
the
purpose
and
goal
of
protecting
state
sovereignty
that
the
parker
exemption
was
intended
for;
that
in
this
case
this
test
has
not
been
met.
it
has
not
been
met
because
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
not
addressed
the
displacement
of
the
competition
defined
in
our
complaint.
it
has
not
expressly
articulated
its
policy
decision
to
do
so.
in
this
case,
the
city
of
eau
claire
made
the
policy
decision
to
displace
competition,
and
then
implemented
their
own
policy
decision.
this
is
not
exempt.
now,
this--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--your
honor,
you
have
to
look
at
the
complaint
and
what
is
the
actionable
conduct
here.
the
actionable
conduct
here
is
not
a
refusal
to
provide
sewage
services
in
the
unincorporated
areas
constituting
the
towns.
what
is
the
gravamen
of
our
complaint
is,
number
one,
that
the
city
has
acquired
a
monopoly
in
sewage
treatment
services
that
extends
into
these
unincorporated
territories;
that
they
are
a
monopolist
in
sewage
treatment
services
in
the
towns.
number
two,
we
are
saying
that
their
anticompetitive
conduct
is
the
use
of
that
monopoly
power
in
the
towns
in
that
geographic
market
to
monopolize
sewage
collection
services,
which
we
say
is
a
different
product
market.
we
submit
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
never,
in
any
way
or
form,
said
to
the
city
you
are
authorized
to
monopolize
competition
in
sewage
services
in
the
town.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
yes,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--yes,
it
did.
it
did
and
it
didn't,
because
let
me--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--well,
your
honor,
when
you
look
at
the
tests
that
the
seventh
circuit
applied,
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
determine
from
reading
the
statutes
that
the
state
of
wisconsin,
through
its
legislature,
ever
contemplated
this
displacement
of
competition.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
and
this,
i
think,
was
a
mistake
for
this
reason:
the
city
has
consistently
attempted
to
characterize
our
complaint
as
complaining
against
the
city's
refusal
to
provide
sewage
services
in
these
unincorporated
areas.
as
our
reply
brief
points
out,
this
is
just
the
opposite
of
what
we
are
claiming.
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
city
refuses
to
provide
service
in
this
area.
we
are
claiming
that
they
are
monopolizing
sewage
collection
services.
and
if
i
might
describe
the
situation.
competition...
once
service
is
in
place,
it's
provided
on
a
monopoly
basis.
the
competition
relevant
and
the
competition
defined
in
our
complaint
is
in
the
geographic
market
of
the
unincorporated
areas
constituting
the
towns.
it
isn't
in
the
area
where
people
are
not
yet
receiving
sewage
collection
services.
both
the
city
and
the
towns,
under
the
statutes,
the
wisconsin
statutes,
may
provide
sewage
collection
services
in
this
unincorporated
territory.
just
like
the
electric
utilities,
the
competition
between
the
city
and
the
towns
is
for
people
not
yet
receiving
service.
what
we
are
saying
is,
the
city
through
it
monopoly
power
in
sewage
treatment
services,
which
we
need...
we
cannot
provide
collection
services
without
treatment
services...
it
is
the
bottleneck
theory
of
an
anticompetitive
conduct.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
well,
if
you're
saying...
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
city
was
authorized
to
refuse
to
provide
service.
i
think
that
that
we
would
not
lose,
because
that
is
not
germane
to
our
complaint.
our
complaint
and
our
claim
is
that
the
city
is
monopolizing
service.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
this
is
true.
and
we
are
not
asking
for
any
relief
from
annexation.
none
of
the
statutes
relied
on
by
the
seventh
circuit
or
the
city
deal
with
annexation.
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
annexation
statutes
that
define
when
annexation
may
occur.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
yes,
i
did.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
because
they
took
the
city's
construction
of
our
complaint
and
decided
that
our
claim
was
something
that
we
said
it
wasn't.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
yes,
it
is.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
yes,
they
did.
and
i
think
that
the
point,
in
answering
your
question,
they
said
that
the
city
was
authorized
to
engage
in
particular
conduct.
they
said
that
we
don't
care,
we
do
not
need
to
make
a
finding
as
to
whether
the
state,
when
they
told
the
city
they
could
do
this,
desired
to
displace
competition.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
and
i
say
that
that--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--that's
correct.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
no.
i
think
the
first
question
is:
has
the
sovereign
state
acted?
has
the
sovereign
state,
in
its
sovereignty,
decided
to
displace
competition?
the
second
issue
of
whether
the
city
must
be
compelled
or
whether
it
has
some
discretion
deals
with
whether
the
state
has
selected
the
city
to
be
its
instrument
to
implement
that
policy.
my
position
is
that
if
the
state
of
wisconsin
hasn't
decided
to
displace
competition,
if
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
neutral,
how
can
the
city
claim
to
be
implementing
that
policy?
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
this
is
true.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
that's
correct.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
yes,
i
will.
our
position
is
that,
just
like
electric
generation
is
one
product
market
and
electric
distribution
is
another
product
market,
as
that's
been
recognized--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--the
competitors
here
for
the
provision
of
collection
and
transportation
services...
and
by
that,
i
mean
putting
the
pipe
in
the
ground
and
receiving
the
sewage
from
the
ultimate
users...
are
the
city
and
the
towns
within
their
respective
unincorporated
territories.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
yes.
we
have
alleged
that
they--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--we
have
alleged
that
they
are
monopolizing
it;
that
they
have,
through
their
use
of
monopoly
power,
have
foreclosed
the
towns
from
providing
sewage
collection
services
in
the
towns
while
they
are
offering
to
provide
those
same
services
to
the
people
located
in
these
unincorporated
areas.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
but
my
point
is
that
that's
a
by-product.
by
the
time
the
annexation
occurs,
the
towns
have
already
been
eliminated
as
competitors
by
the
city's
anticompetitive
conduct.
in
other
words,
a
person
in
the
town,
if
he
wishes
to
receive
collection--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--yes.
the
town
of
washington,
when
this
suit
was
commenced,
had
a
town
sanitary
district,
was
buying
treatment
services
from
the
city
of
eau
claire.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
that's
correct.
and
since
then
has
been
bought
by
the
city
of
eau
claire.
obviously,
that
is
not
in
the
record.
that
wasn't
alleged
in
the
complaint
in
any
detail.
our
position
is
very
simple.
we
say
that
the
city
is
characterizing
it
as
a
refusal
to
sell
to
anybody.
we're
saying...
our
complaint
is
just
the
opposite.
we're
saying
that
our
complaint
says
they
are,
in
fact,
monopolizing
this
service.
to
prove
that,
we
would
have
to
prove,
number
one,
that
this
is
trade
or
commerce.
we
would
have
to
prove
that,
just
like
electric
municipal
electric
services,
there
is
a
price
here.
in
other
words,
unlike
police
and
fire,
when
you
get
sewage
service,
that
service
is
measured
and
you
are
charged
a
price.
number
two,
it
requires
that
the
city
have
monopoly
power
in
one
market,
here
sewage
treatment,
extending
beyond
its
city
limits
into
the
unincorporated
areas
of
the
towns.
the
reason
that
exists
is
because
there
are,
number
one,
regulatory
barriers.
this
is
a
regional
facility.
due
to
environmental
impact,
that
facility
is
the
only
one
that
can
treat
the
area.
there
are
also
economic
barriers.
the
costs,
the
investment
costs
of
building
such
a
facility
are
prohibitive.
so
they
have
this
monopoly
that
they
have
acquired
with
federal
funds
and
now
are
saying
we
will
not
let
you
buy
the
service
so
you
can
compete
with
us.
so
what
they
do
is,
if
i
am
in
the
town
and
i
want
sewage
collection
service,
i
have
but
one
source.
that
is
the
city,
because
the
city
will
not
provide
or
sell
to
the
towns
the
treatment
service
so
the
towns
can
compete
with
them
in
these
unincorporated
areas
in
the
other
market,
the
collection
market.
so
our
complaint,
regardless
of
what
the
city
says,
is
just
the
opposite
of
what
the
city
says.
it
is
that
they
are
monopolizing
these
services
in
the
unincorporated
territories.
now,
getting
to
the--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--then
i
would
be
done,
your
honor.
if
the
state
of
wisconsin--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--i
would.
if
the
state
of
wisconsin
said,
we--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--that's
right.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
the
question
is
simply
this:
has
the
state
of
wisconsin
made
the
decision
to
displace
competition?
has
the
state
of
wisconsin
decided
that
the
city
should
provide
service
on
a
monopoly
basis,
displacing
this
competition
between
the
towns
and
the
city,
or
has
the
city
made
that
decision?
and
i
submit
that--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--no.
no,
that's
not
true.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
well,
that
is--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--well,
as
i've
indicated,
that
isn't
factually
true.
they
are
serving
this
section
of
the
town
of
washington
that
is
still
in
the
town
of
washington.
the
point
that
i'm
making
is,
you
are
correct;
the
general
policy
is,
if
you
want
treatment
services
and
collection
services,
we
will
annex
you.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
we
haven't
alleged
that.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
no,
it
isn't.
it
really
isn't,
because,
number
one,
police
and
fire
services,
for
example,
are
not
services
capable
of
gaining
a
monopoly
power.
there
are
not
those
economic
or
regulatory
barriers
to
create
a
monopoly
in
that
area,
nor
is
there
a
price
for
those
services
in
the
trade
or
commerce
sense.
in
other
words,
i
do
not...
if
the
police
officer
comes
to
my
house,
i'm
not
sent
a
bill
for
that.
unlike
in
lafayette,
where
the
municipal
electric
utilities
send
a
bill,
measured
on
how
much
service
is
received.
so,
no,
our
point
is--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--not
in
this
instance.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
well,
then
our
argument
would
be
that
they
have
to
sell
a
service
at
a
fair
and
non-discriminatory
price;
otherwise,
they're
violating
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
no.
well,
you
can't
have
a
price
squeeze
to
force
our
competitors.
in
other
words,
saying
i
won't
sell
to
you
at
all
so
you
can't
compete
with
me
is
no
different
from
saying
i'm
going
to
sell
to
you
at
such
a
high
price
that
you
can't
compete
with
me
at
all.
so,
no.
our
position
is
simply
this:
that
under
the
wisconsin
statutes...
the
remedy
we
seek
is
under
the
wisconsin
statutes.
that
statute
provides
for
a
contract
between
the
city
selling
us
these
services.
we
would
pay
them
a
price
for
these
services.
they
already,
because
they
have
a
monopoly,
have
the
capacity
to
serve
this
whole
region.
we
would
put
the
pipe
in
the
ground.
the
city
would
not
do
anything
in
the
towns.
we
would
run
our
pipe
and
abut
it
into
the
city's.
they
would
measure
the
flow.
we
would
pay
them
the
cost
of
transporting
the
sewage
through
the
pipe
to
the
treatment
facility,
and
we
would
pay
them
a
fair
price
for
treating
that
sewage.
we
are
basically
buying
a
wholesale
service
so
we
can
retail
that
service
to
the
users
in
the
towns.
what
we're
saying
is
we
just
want
the
opportunity
to
compete
with
you.
we
want
the
opportunity
to
offer
to
people
sewage
collection
services.
we
think
we
can
do
it
cheaper;
we
think
we
can
do
it
better;
but
you're
stopping
us
by
your
anticompetitive
conduct.
you're
stopping
us
by
refusing
to
give
us
sewage
treatment
services
that
we
must
have
to
get
into
this
market.
so
our
position
is
no,
this
is
not
an
annexation
case.
this
is
not
a
political
case.
if
we
are
to
go
to
court,
we
will
have
to
prove
that
this
is
commerce;
that
there
is
monopoly
power;
that
there
are
two
separate
products;
that
there
is
competition;
that
this
competition
is
being
restrained
by
the
city
anticompetitive
conduct.
the
relief
we
are
seeking
does
not
address
annexation.
the
relief
we
are
seeking
does
not
address
police
or
fire
service.
it
simply
addresses
the
right
to
buy
at
a
fair
and
reasonable
price
sewage
treatment
services.
and
i
think
that
brings
us
back
to
the
question,
and
that
question
is:
can
the
court
select
two
unrelated
statutes
and
ignore
the
rest
of
the
statutes
in
the
statute
books
and
determine
that
there
is
a
clearly
articulated
policy
when
there
is
none?
the
wisconsin
statutes
form
the
basis
for
this
competition.
they
say
both
the
city
and
the
towns
may
provide
service
in
this
unincorporated
territory.
so
the
very
basis
for
this
competition
is
created
by
the
wisconsin
statutes.
there
is
nothing,
we
submit,
in
the
decision
or
in
the
statutes
that
indicate
the
state
of
wisconsin
ever
decided
that
this
competition
should
be
displaced
and
that
the
city
should
provide
monopoly
service.
and
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
that
is
judge
wisdom's
opinion,
and
that's
the
reasonable
and
foreseeable
test.
if,
in
fact,
the
state
of
wisconsin...
there
was
evidence
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
had
affirmatively
addressed
the
displacement
of
competition,
the
reasonable
and
foreseeable
test
would
not
be
necessary.
under
the
test,
instead
of
determining
from
reading
the
statutes,
that
the
state
has
addressed
the
issue,
the
court
assumes
it.
if
the
court
assumes
that
the
state
has
addressed
it,
that's
not
a
test;
that's
an
elimination
of
the
test.
so
the
seventh
circuit
said
we
need
to
find
no
evidence
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
affirmatively
addressed
this
displacement
of
competition.
we're
going
to
assume
it.
now,
they
are
assuming
it,
i
presume,
because
the
city
has
found
a
way
to
use
its
delegated
power
in
an
anticompetitive
fashion.
now,
the
court,
on
the
other
hand,
must
also
assume
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
contemplated
that
that
conduct
would
be
used
in
a
pro-competitive
fashion.
and
there's
no
question
that
this
conduct
that
they
have
done,
or
this
delegated
authority
can
be
used
both
pro-competitively
and
anti-competitively.
but
i
think
the
point
is,
instead
of
finding
evidence
that
the
state
really
affirmatively
addressed
it,
where
they
can
look
at
the
statutes
and
say
yes,
this
state
thought
about
this,
they
have
assumed
it
without
any
statutory
evidence
that
that's
true.
that
assumes
that
every
time
the
state
delegates
some
authority,
that
they
have
in
mind
all
the
possible
uses
of
that
authority.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
no.
i
do
disagree,
and
i
will
say
what
i
believe
the
state
has
said.
the
state
of
wisconsin,
through
14407,
has
said
the
state
will
not
compel,
will
not
compel
the
city
to
extend
monopoly
service
against
the
city's
wishes.
this
is
quite
different
from
saying
to
the
city
that
our
policy
is
that
you
may
monopolize
these
services
in
this
area.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
i
think
what
the
seventh
circuit...
when
you
boil
it
down,
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
is
that
the
city's
conduct
is
not
prohibited
by
wisconsin
law,
its
law.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
well,
if
you
look
at
the
test
when
they
apply
it,
they
say,
number
one,
we
assume
the
state
contemplated
it;
number
two,
we
infer
that
they
condone
it.
they
didn't
say
"intended",
but
"condone"
it.
and
i
say
that
all
that
the
seventh
circuit
said
is,
having
assumed
they
thought
about
it
without
proof,
we're
going
to
infer
that
they
condone
it
because
they
didn't
prohibit
it.
now,
from
there
they
make
the
quantum
leap
that,
because
they
condone
it,
they
intended
it.
and
i
submit
that
under
the
boulder
decision,
that's
precise
neutrality.
in
other
words,
the
state
says
we're
not
going
to
make
the
decision,
city;
you
make
the
decision.
you
can
use
this
authority
to
compete
or
not
to
compete.
you
make
the
decision.
so
this
isn't
a
case
where
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
displaced
competition.
instead,
they
have
refused
to
make
that
decision
and
said
to
the
cities,
you
make
that
decision.
and
what
we
have
here,
under
the
delegated
authority,
the
city
of
eau
claire
can
engage
in
anticompetitive
conduct.
the
next
city
to
it
can
use
that
same
delegated
authority
in
a
pro-competitive
fashion.
so
each
city
is
free
to
make
its
own
policy
decision.
and
that's
the
question.
under
the
seventh
circuit's
test,
we
drop
exemption
from
a
policy
decision
made
at
the
state
level
to
a
policy
decision
made
at
the
municipal
level.
and
the
result
of
the
seventh
circuit's
test
is
that
municipal
policy
decisions
to
displace
competition
are
exempt;
whereas
i
believe,
under
this
court's
rulings,
it's
only
when
the
state
has
made
that
decision.
i
see
that
my
time
is
almost
up,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
for
rebuttal.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
yes,
your
honor.
the
word
"local
autonomy"
kept
coming
up
in
the
city's
argument.
the
city
is
saying
we
want
the
autonomy
to
make
anticompetitive
decisions
and
implement
them
because
we
are
creatures
of
the
state,
free
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
this
issue
was
addressed
in
lafayette.
this
court
said
cities
are
not
sovereign.
cities,
unlike
states,
are
subject
to
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
their
status
does
not
elevate
them
above
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
i
submit
that
the
question
is
who
decided
to
displace
competition.
and
when
the
statutes
are
looked
at,
it's
clear
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
decide
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
decided
to
displace
this
competition.
in
fact,
the
town's
position
was
that
was
the
issue.
the
seventh
circuit
said
no,
that
is
not
the
issue;
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
state
of
wisconsin
decided
to
displace
this
competition
with
monopoly
service.
instead,
we're
going
to
look
at
whether
they
delegated
some
authority,
which
the
city
then
could
make
its
own
policy
decision
to
use
in
an
anticompetitive
fashion.
this
case
flies
in
the
face
of
the
boulder
decision.
in
boulder,
this
court
assumed
that
the
city
of
boulder
was
authorized
by
the
state
to
regulate
cable
tv
under
its
home
rule
powers.
now,
does
it
make
any
difference
if
the
state
would
have
listed
in
its
home
rule
powers
that
cable
tv
is
one
of
the
things
listed?
but
in
boulder,
the
court
said
no;
the
state
is
neutral,
because
the
state
didn't
say
use
that
power
to
displace
competition
with
monopoly
service
or
regulation.
all
it
said
is--
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
--well,
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
unless
it
laid
out
some
criteria
for
the
city
to
decide
when
it
will
and
will
not
monopolize,
i
think
that
is
simply
saying
to
the
cities,
we
hereby
authorize
you
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
in
parker
v.
brown,
it
was
stated
a
state
does
not
give
immunity
to
those
who
violate
the
sherman
act
by
authorizing
them
to
violate
it
or
declaring
that
their
action
is
lawful.
mr.
claude
j.
covelli
yes.
i
think
that's
what
you
said
in
lafayette.
they
are
both
controlled
by
parochial
interests.
they
both
have
their
own
interests
at
heart,
which
do
not
necessarily
coincide
with
the
state's
statewide
interest.
thank
you.
