what
would
happen
if
we
rule
with
you,
and
then
the
following
month,
the
legislature
of
wisconsin
said
we
meant
to
give
a
monopoly,
and
if
we
didn't,
we
are
doing
it
now.
justice
marshall
you
would
be
done
in.
justice
marshall
that's
the
only
thing
this
case
is
about
is
whether
wisconsin
meant
to
do
it
or
not.
justice
marshall
that's
all
we
are
interested
in
this
case.
justice
marshall
you
claim
you
want
us
to
settle
this
problem
for
you.
and
do
you
admit
that
you
could
settle
it
right
there
in
wisconsin?
justice
marshall
in
your
legislature?
justice
marshall
but
you
could,
couldn't
you?
justice
marshall
theoretically?
couldn't...
is
there
anything
to
stop
your
legislature
from
passing
a
bill
saying
that
the
counties
have
this
right?
justice
marshall
so
it
could
be
done
without
bothering
us
with
it.
justice
marshall
the
state
could
get
to
that,
too,
couldn't
they?
justice
marshall
and
then
we'll
have
the
states
jumping
on
us
for
legislating.
justice
marshall
well,
i
assume
there's
no
way
out
for
us.
we're
just
in
bad
shape.
