justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question,
because
this
is
sort
of
an
unusual
case.
the
relevant
market,
as
i
understand
it,
the
market
in
which
there's
competition
that
you
say
has
been
displaced
is
the
market
for
the
transportation
and...
collection
and
transportation
of
sewage.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
now,
would
you
tell
me
who
the
competitors
are
in
that
market
and
what
the
nature
of
the
competition
is
that's
been
displaced?
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
not
interested
in
comparisons;
i'm
interested
in
who
are
the
competitors
in
this
market.
justice
stevens
is
the
city
seeking
to
get
that
business
in
your
towns?
justice
stevens
are
they
refusing
to
do
it?
justice
stevens
are
they
only
offering
to
do
that
if
they
would
be
annexed
to
the
city?
justice
stevens
is
it
not
correct
that
the
towns
are
just
potential
competitors?
have
they
ever
provided
this
service?
justice
stevens
from
this
supplier?
justice
stevens
am
i
correct,
mr.
covelli,
that
in
effect
they
have
defined
the
market
to
include
their
own
taxpayers?
justice
stevens
they
won't
serve
anybody
unless
he's
a
resident
of
the
municipality;
isn't
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
justice
stevens
because
they've
got
to
become
annexed
in
order
to
get
the
service.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
they're
monopolizing
the
business,
providing
fire
and
police
services
as
well.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
stevens
but
you
see,
logically
it's
the
same
sort
of
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
there
you
have
a
public
agency
regulating
the
price.
you
don't
have
any
public
agency
in
wisconsin,
or
do
you,
that
regulates
the
price
of
sewage
services?
justice
stevens
what
if
they
said
we'll
hook
you
up,
but
we'll
charge
you
$1,000
a
gallon
or
something?
would
that
comply
with
the--
justice
stevens
--in
other
words,
the
antitrust
law
are
sort
of
a
price
regulation
statute?
