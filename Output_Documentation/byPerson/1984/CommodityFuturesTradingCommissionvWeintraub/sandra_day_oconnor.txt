mr.
kuhlik,
i'm
curious
about
how
this
process
would
work.
assuming
that
you
are
correct
ultimately
that
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
has
the
power
to
waive
the
privilege
for
the
corporation,
is
that
limited
in
any
way?
in
other
words,
is
that
qualified
by
a
power
to
waive
it
if
it
will
somehow
benefit
the
estate?
and
if
so,
is
it
somehow
necessary
that
the
trustee
would
find
out
first
what
it
is
that's
going
to
be
waived
before
making
that
decision,
and
how
would
that
be
accomplished?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wouldn't
the
trustee
have
to
know
what
the
communication
was
before
deciding
whether
to
waive
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
does
the
trustee
know
that
without
knowing
what
the
information
was?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
procedures
are
there
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
the
power
of
the
trustee
to
waive
the
privilege
limited
to
matters
concerning
the
estate's
claims
and
assets?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
it's
conceivable
that
there
might
be
some
that
aren't
related.
and
is
there
any
limitation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kuhlik,
do
you
think
the
same
rule
would
apply
in
an
individual
bankruptcy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what's
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
hope
you'd
respond
a
little
more
fully
than
that.
do
you
think
the
privilege
is
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
third
party
asking
for
the
information
in
a
corporate
liquidation
is
some
tax
commissioner,
and
suppose
that
the
disclosure
of
the
information
would
have
the
effect
of
revealing
some
taxes
that
might
be
due
that
would
eliminate
any
hope
of
recovery
by
the
creditors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
is
the
trustee
going
to
know
unless
he
finds
out
the
answer
first
as
to
what
the
information
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
did
the
interests
of
the
shareholders
and
the
creditors
differ
in
the
context
of
a
liquidation?
it
seems
to
me
both
of
them
stand
to
be
advantaged
by
anything
that
will
maximize
the
value
of
the
estate.
i
don't
see
a
conflict.
the
trustee
is
trying
to
produce
the
largest
number
of
assets
and
defeat
claims
against
the
estate,
and
the
shareholders
and
creditors
will
all
benefit
by
that
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
that's
why
i
asked
those
questions.
but
assuming
that
the
trustee
knows
what
the
communication
is
and
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
waiver
of
it
will
benefit
the
estate,
either
by
advancing
the
acquisition
of
assets
or
defeating
some
claim
against
the
estate,
why
shouldn't
the
trustee
be
able
to
waive
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
trustee
doesn't
have
to
go
to
the
directors
for
any
other
purpose
in
maximizing
the
value
of
the
estate.
there
are
a
whole
raft
of
things
that
the
trustee
can
do
without
consultation
with
the
board
of
directors.
and
i
don't
understand
why
the
privilege
should
be
any
different
from
those
other
things.
