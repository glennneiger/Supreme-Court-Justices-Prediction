justice
white
whose
privilege
is
it?
justice
white
well,
it
was
and
it
still
is.
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but
it's
just
a
question
of
who
can
exercise
it
or
who
can
give
it
away.
do
you
agree
that
your
prior
management
could
have
waived
it?
justice
white
well,
just
forget
bankruptcy
for
a
minute.
before
bankruptcy
could
then-current
management
waive
the
privilege?
justice
white
well,
and
suppose
then
they
had
a
stockholders
meeting
and
they
voted
out
the
old
management,
put
in
some
new
management.
the
new
management
could
waive
it?
justice
white
well,
what's
wrong
with
the
trustee
waiving
it?
justice
white
why
isn't
he?
justice
white
what
are
the
trustee's
powers?
isn't
it
to
operate
the
business?
justice
white
this
isn't
a
debtor
in
possession,
is
it?
justice
white
well,
i
know
you
don't.
you
must
think
that
at
least.
but
the
trustee...
the
old
directors
haven't
any
power
to
run
the
business.
they
are
no
longer
managing
the
business.
justice
white
well,
operating,
then.
justice
white
well,
that's
your
direction.
i
think
the
trustee
is
managing
the
business.
justice
white
a
reorganization.
justice
white
give
me
an
example
of
where
it's
held
that
the
privilege
is
not
to
be
waived?
give
me
a
concrete
case?
justice
white
well,
does
the
question
come
up
when
the
trustee
sues
somebody?
justice
white
well,
give
me
an
example
of
litigation
where
the
privilege
would
be
claimed,
and
by
whom.
justice
white
and
the
lawyer
claimed
the
privilege?
justice
white
especially
when
he
may
have
a
suit
pending
against
the
board
of
directors.
justice
white
five
is
enough.
justice
white
well,
isn't
the
normal
result
of
a
corporate
chapter
7
liquidation
the
extinction
of
the
corporation?
justice
white
well,
suppose
that
this
was
the
normal
case.
the
trustee
gets
title
to
all
the
assets?
does
he
still
do
that
under
the
new
bankruptcy
code?
justice
white
but
he
used
to.
justice
white
but
he
has
the
management
of
all
of
them,
and
his
powers
with
respect
to
them
are
very
much
like
under
the
old
code?
justice
white
and
the
corporate
management,
the
old
corporate
management,
cannot
interfere
with
those
duties
of
the
trustee.
well,
what
happens
if
the
corporate...
when
do
corporations
go
out
of
business?
do
they
formally
dissolve?
what
do
they
do?
justice
white
they
certainly
don't
have
anything
to
do
in
chapter
7.
justice
white
what
happens
to
the
privilege
then?
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know
why,
if
you
know
that
the
inevitable
result
in
99
percent
of
the
cases
is
going
to
be
liquidation
and
there's
nothing
that
old
management
can
do
about
it,
or
dissolution,
what's
so
earth-shaking
about
saying
the
trustee
can
waive?
i'm
not
sure
he
even
has
to
waive.
there
wouldn't
have
to
be
a
waiver
after
dissolution,
would
there?
justice
white
well,
new
management
can
sue
old
management
and
frequently
does.
justice
white
and
they
can
waive,
in
connection
with
that
they
can
waive
the
privilege.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
the
lawyer
refuses
to
testify
he's
going
to
be
in
trouble
if
management
says,
the
current
management
says,
please
talk.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--it
depends
on
how
delinquent
the
corporation
might
be
to
those
creditors.
justice
white
it
sounds
like
you're
concerned
about
the
lawyers
more
than
the
client
whose
privilege
it
is.
and
i
thought
it
belonged
to
the
client,
and
that
the
attorney
just
exercises
on
behalf
of
the
client,
not
to
protect
himself.
