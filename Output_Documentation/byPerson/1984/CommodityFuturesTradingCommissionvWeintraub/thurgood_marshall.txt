in
normal
business
when
a
man
sells
his
business
to
another
individual,
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
part
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
basically
that
attorney-client
privilege
was
a
"personal"
privilege.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
pass
along
a
personal
privilege?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
pass
along
a
personal
privilege?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
property...
is
attorney-client
privilege
a
property
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
only
point
is,
speaking
for
myself,
the
personal
one,
you're
carrying
a
whole
lot
of
baggage.
if
you
didn't
insist
on
it
you
wouldn't
have
that
baggage.
that's
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other
privileged
matter
that
needs
the
protection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
privilege?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
can't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
the
law
is
now,
what
is
privileged
that
the
corporation
only
can
waive,
other
than
the
lawyer-client
privilege?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
a
variation
of
the
attorney-client.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
true,
you
just
want
to
cut
this
little
niche
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
can
get
all
of
the
secrets
they
want,
all
of
the
secret
formulas,
everything
else,
but
if
a
lawyer's
attached
to
it
you
don't
get
it?
justice
marshall
what
else
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
makes
it
so
different
because
a
lawyer's
attached
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
thought
that
once
you
took
a
chapter
7
or
any
of
the
others,
the
trustee
was
acting
in
the
company's
interest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
including?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
also
includes
the
management.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
get
as
many
people
to
agree
with
you
on
that
as
disagree.
justice
thurgood
marshall
five.
won't
five
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
assume
that
all
corporations
that
have
privilege
with
their
lawyers
are
going
bankrupt.
justice
marshall
it
sounded
like
it
a
minute
ago.
justice
marshall
does
that
also
apply
to
countries
that
are
going
bankrupt?
