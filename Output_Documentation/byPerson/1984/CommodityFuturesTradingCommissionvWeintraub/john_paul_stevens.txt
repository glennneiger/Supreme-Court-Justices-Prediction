justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
following
up
on
justice
o'connor's
question
about
individual,
i
gather
then
from
your
answer
on
individual
you
do
not
contend
that
the
privilege
is
an
asset
of
the
estate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
make
that
as
an
alternative
argument,
that
would
apply
to
an
individual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
since
you
said
this
case
does
not
necessarily
control
individual
situations,
you
must
be
saying
it's
not
an
asset
of
the
estate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
put
it
to
you:
is
it
your
position
that
the
privilege
is
an
asset
of
the
estate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
don't
really
have
a
position
on
whether
it
is
or
is
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
want
to
win
the
lawsuit,
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
follow
under
your
management
theory
that
if
you
have
a
reorganization
and
the
reorganization
trustee
employs
counsel
and
gets
legal
advice,
that
after
the
reorganization
successor
management
could
waive
his
privilege?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kuhlik,
can
i
back
up
just
a
second.
justice
john
paul
stevens
take
the
situation
right
before
bankruptcy,
when
a
corporation
is
in
desperate
straits
and
feels
it
needs
legal
advice
in
a
lot
of
difficult
problems.
should
the
lawyer
advise
the
corporate
client
that
comes
to
him
in
that
position,
say:
remember,
anything
you
tell
me
now
is
going
to
be
fair
game
for
the
trustee
to
disclose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
your
answer
is
yes,
they
should
tell
them
that?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence.
if
you
finished,
what
factor
was
it
you
were
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask,
i
guess
it
applies
equally
to
an
individual
or
a
corporation,
is
really
the
same
one
justice
o'connor
asked
earlier.
what
about
access
to
privileged
information?
would
you
agree
that
the
trustee
would
have
access
to
corporate
information
that's
in
the
mind
of...
that
had
been
imparted
to
counsel
in
a
privileged
communication?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
should
think
there'd
be
many
cases
in
which
information
that
had
been
imparted
to
counsel
in
a
privileged
communication
might
well
be
an
important
corporate
asset.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
you
might
describe
a
trade
secret
or
a
customer
list
or
something
like
that
in
the
course
of
such
a
communication.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
could
the
executor
of
an
estate
waive
the
privilege?
justice
stevens
well,
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
question:
who
has
the
power
to
control
litigation?
justice
stevens
isn't
the
waiver
decision
almost
invariably
made
as
an
incident
to
tactical
decisions
in
litigation?
isn't
it
fair
to
say
this
is
an
incident
of
the
power
to
control
litigation?
justice
stevens
how
different
is
that
from
the
takeover,
new
management
type
of
thing?
i
mean,
they're
not
necessarily
friendly
or
buddy-buddy
with
the
old
people.
