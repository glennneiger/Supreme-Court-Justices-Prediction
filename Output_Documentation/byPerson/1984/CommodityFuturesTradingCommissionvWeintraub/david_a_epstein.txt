mr.
david
a.
epstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
in
this
case,
both
on
the
specifics
of
this
case
and
perhaps
more
importantly
on
the
general
proposition
being
advocated
by
the
government,
could
not
be
more
directly
opposite
the
government.
we
contend
that
upon
the
occurrence
of
bankruptcy,
when
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
is
appointed
for
either
an
individual
debtor
or
a
corporate
debtor
or
a
partnership
debtor
or
a
trust
debtor,
that
the
power
to
control
the
attorney-client
privilege
of
the
bankrupt
does
not
pass
to
the
trustee.
it
does
not
pass
in
the
first
instance
because
congress
has
not
given
it
the
power
to
the
trustee.
despite
all
the
briefs
which
have
been
submitted
on
this
point,
we
still
find
that
nowhere
in
the
bankruptcy
code
or
in
any
other
congressional
enactment
has
there
been
any
transfer
of
anybody's
attorney-client
privilege
to
bankruptcy
trustees
in
any
circumstances.
the
code
does
not
say
what
the
government
would
like
it
to
say
and
it
does
not
say
what
the
government
asks
this
court
to
read
into
it.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
it
is...
in
this
instance,
it
is
the
corporation's
privilege.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
i
would
agree
with
that
upon
the
occurrence
of
bankruptcy.
i
would
only
disagree
with--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--yes,
and
they're
the
only
ones
who
can.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
absolutely.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
he's
not
management.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
because
the
board
of
directors,
who
is
management,
still
exists.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
it
is
perhaps--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--no,
but
i
don't
think
it
matters.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
they
are
no
longer
operating
the
business.
they
are,
however--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--well,
let's
talk
about
operating
if
that's
the
direction
your
honor
wishes
to
pursue.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
in
a
chapter
7,
such
as
is
before
the
court
in
this
case,
the
operation
of
the
business
is
nothing
more
than
winding
down
its
affairs.
in
a
chapter
11,
it
seems
to
me
the
government's
argument
at
least
superficially
is
stronger
because--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--in
a
reorganization,
whether
it's
a
debtor
in
possession
is
a
trustee,
there
is
a
genuine
operation
of
the
business.
but
in
all
of
the
powers
which
the
bankruptcy
code
vests
in
trustees
to
manage,
temporarily
or
on
a
longer
term
basis,
the
business
of
the
debtor,
control
of
privilege
is
not
amongst
the
powers,
nor
is
it
reasonably
implied.
if
it
were,
then
i
think
the
court
should
recognize
that
those
powers,
whatever
they
are,
are
identical
for
individuals,
for
corporations,
and
for
other
types
of
debtors
which
can
file
bankruptcy
or
be
involuntarily
put
into
bankruptcy.
they're
identical,
whatever
they
are.
now,
the
power
which
today
in
oral
argument
the
government
focuses
most
strenuously
upon
is
the
power
to
control
litigation.
examine
that
for
a
moment.
the
same
is
true
for
an
individual.
the
same
is
true
for
litigation
concerning
the
business
and
affairs.
justice
o'connor's
question
to
mr.
kuhlik
earlier
hits
the
point
right
on
the
head.
insofar
as
we
are
talking
about
disclosure
of
confidential
information
relating
to
the
business
and
the
affairs
and
the
litigation
of
the
debtor,
the
code
is
100
percent
symmetrical.
there's
no
distinction
between
individuals,
corporations,
or
anything
else.
ultimately
this
case,
to
the
extent
it
is
being
argued,
perhaps
more
so
than
many
other
cases,
on
a
theoretical
level,
the
theoretical
difference
between
a
corporation
and
an
individual
ultimately
devolves
upon
one
connector--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--the
only
factor
is
that,
unlike
an
individual
who
operates
a
business,
a
corporation
who
operates
has
divided
the
management
from
the
ownership.
but
there
is
still
management
in
either
event.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
i
would
not
agree,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court...
and
frankly,
the
reason
i
would
not
agree
is
because,
having
examined
the
law
and
the
cases,
and
i
must
say
somewhat
to
my
surprise
as
i
got
into
this,
it's
not
there
either.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
while
a
good
portion
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
talk
about
the
power
of
the
trustee,
not
to
waive
the
privilege,
which
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
but
the
power
of
the
trustee
to
get
inside
the
privilege,
as
it
were,
to
obtain
the
information,
which
is
your
question,
justice--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--well,
i
think--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
i
might
agree
with
you.
the
difficulty
is
that
the
cases
over
the
years
and
the
congressional
understanding
and
certainly
the
understanding
of
the
commentators
for
100
years
at
least
is
that
the
debtor's
attorney-client
privilege
not
only
survived
into
bankruptcy,
but
applied
as
against
the
trustee.
now,
it's
remarkable,
if
not
astounding,
your
honor,
that
for
a
hundred
years
this
question
has
simply
not
been
litigated
until
the
waiver
theory
came
up
for
the
first
time
in
the
late
1970's,
mid-1970's.
for
a
hundred
years
we've
had
bankruptcy
laws,
we
have
not
had
a
waiver
theory,
and
we
have
not
had
litigation
over
the
privilege
either
passing
to
the
trustee
or
the
trustee's
invading
it.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
i
cannot
give
you
any
case
before
1976,
i
believe.
the
amjoe
case
was
the
first
case
ever
to
consider
the
possibility
of
a
waiver
by
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
nobody
has
found,
not
only
a
case,
nobody
has
found
academic
discussion
of
this
possibility.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
the
question
of
waiver
has
never
come
up.
it
is
simply
there
is
a
silence
for
a
hundred
years.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
the
litigation,
which
are
very
old
cases,
around
the
turn
of
the
century
mostly,
are
cases
where
the
trustee
sought
to
question
the
attorney
of
the
debtor.
now,
i
want
to
make
clear,
the
government
is
right
that
two
of
the
cases
we
have
cited
to
the
court
of
those,
that
was
discussed
by
the
court.
but
the
actual
fact
before
the
court
was
that
it
was
a
third
party's
lawyer.
the
other
two
cases
did
involve
the
lawyer
for
the
debtor
himself,
and
these
were
individuals.
these
were
not
corporations.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
the
lawyer
claimed
the
privilege,
absolutely.
and
the
courts
were,
to
the
extent
they
addressed
it
in
those
days
in
that
context,
were
unanimous
that...
everybody
said,
well,
of
course
the
privilege
carries
over
and
applies,
and
you
can't,
even
the
trustee
can't,
get
inside
the
privilege
as
to
pre-bankruptcy
matters.
and
we
submit
that
what
the
government
is
contending
here
through
the
theory
of
a
waiver
is
not
only
the
access
of
the
trustee
to
the
secrets,
where
there's
at
least
a
reasonable
case...
and
even
that
has
not
been
previously
held,
but
there's
at
least
a
claim
to
that.
here
the
problem
of
the
waiver
is
that
when
the
privilege
is
waived
it's
waived
for
everybody.
it's
open,
and
if
the
corporation's
privilege
is
waived
then
the
corporation's
attorney
is
an
open
book.
everybody
can
subpoena
him.
there's
no
longer
a
privilege
to
prevent
his
testimony.
similarly
with
documents--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--if
the
board
of
directors
of
the
company,
who
represent
the
ownership
of
the
company,
if
they
determine
to
waive
the
privilege
for
reasons
that
are
good
to
them,
i
have
no
objection
whatsoever.
when
the
trustee
comes
in,
he
doesn't
represent
the
owners
of
the
corporation.
he
has
very
different
interests.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
ordinarily,
in
the
common
case,
i
would
assume
that
your
honor's
suggestion
would
be
correct.
however,
it's
not
always
the
case.
it
depends
on
where
there
are
liabilities
from
the
corporation
to,
and
that
is
the
other
side
of
the
question
which
the
government
does
not
address.
they
talk
about
marshalling
the
assets.
that's
one-half
of
the
ledger.
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
is
liabilities
or
potential
liabilities.
and
if
certain
disclosures
are
made
there
may
be
liabilities
which
would
not
otherwise
be
asserted
or
proveable,
which
all
of
a
sudden
become
asserted
or
proveable.
the
principal
example,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief...
it's
not
the
only
one.
i
think
your
honor
in
fact
mentioned
a
very
good
one,
which
is
the
possibility
of
tax
liabilities,
perhaps
unthought
of
previously,
which
can--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--the
trustee
shouldn't
be
able
to
waive
it
because
the
trustee
may
or
may
not
be
doing
it
for
that
reason.
if
in
that
situation
that's
what
he
believes,
he
ought
to
go
to
the
board
of
directors
of
the
company,
which
still
exists,
and
if
your
hypothetical
is
the
case
then
the
board
of
directors
not
only
ought
to
waive
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
have
to
waive
it
or
they
in
turn--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--well,
i
think
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
the
importance
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
what
it
protects
and
the
need
for
this
court
to
continue
that
protection
and
not
abrogate
it--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--well,
it
doesn't
arise
in
this
case,
but
i
would
say--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--i
would
say
the
other
privileges,
certainly.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
the
doctor-patient
privilege.
if
the
trustee
can
waive
the
attorney-client
privilege,
why
can't
he
waive
the
doctor-patient
privilege?
what
about
the
priest-penitent
privilege?
mr.
david
a.
epstein
your
honor,
all
i
can
say--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--the
only
one
which
comes
readily
to
mind
where
it
exists,
in
some
states,
is
the
attorney...
excuse
me...
the
accountant-client
privilege.
and
that
of
course
is
variable.
it
doesn't
exist
in
all
states.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
yes,
it
is.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
for
the
corporation--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--yes,
but--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--well,
it's
not
a
matter
of
the
lawyer
being
attached
to
it.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
what
this
case--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--because
if
the
corporate
personnel,
whether
it
be
corporate
officers
or,
as
it
was
in
the
upjohn
case,
lower
echelon
corporate
employees,
are
not
free
to
confide
in
the
attorneys,
knowing
that
only
when
it's
in
the
company's
best
interests,
not
the
creditors'
best
interests
but
the
company's
best
interests,
that
that's
going
to
be
disclosed,
you're
not
going
to
have
that
kind
of
disclosure.
you're
going
to
have
a
chilling
effect.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
no.
i
think
as
counsel
put
it
and
indeed
as
the
cases
put
it,
the
trustee
acts
in
the
best
interests
of
everyone.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
including
people
whom
management
does
not
act
in
the
best
interest
of.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
that
the
principal
driving
force
behind
the
trustee's
decisionmaking,
unlike
pre-bankruptcy
management's
decisionmaking
at
all
levels
the
trustee
sides
with
the
creditors.
pre
or
non-bankruptcy
management
sides
with,
or
ought
to
side
with
or
they
ought
to
be
removed,
the
owners'
interests,
and
that
is
a
fundamental
difference.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
i
only
want
nine
of
you
to
agree
with
me,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
david
a.
epstein
i'll
settle
for
five.
thank
you.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
normally,
but
not
necessarily,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
he
used
to.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
they
may
formally
dissolve.
i
would
submit--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--well,
no.
what
normally
happens,
assuming
they
don't
come
out
of
chapter
7,
assuming
that
it
goes
through
to
completion,
is
that
they
ultimately
are
dissolved
by
the
incorporating
state.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
that's
an
excellent
question.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
well,
i
don't
know.
i
see
nothing
in
the
ethical
guidelines
that
tell
the
lawyer
that
he's
free
to
disclose
just
because
of
the
death
of
the
client.
i
say
that
quite
seriously,
your
honor.
in
most
states
the
privilege
survives
the
death
of
the
client,
and
i
don't
know
that
it's
any
different.
but
i
think
there's
a
more
interesting
concern
here.
if--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--in
some
states
yes,
in
others
no.
the
cases
are
divided
on
that.
however,
your
honor
has
a
valid
point.
in
some
cases,
yes.
but
it's
interesting,
because
that's
only
in
the
course
of
litigation.
there
are
certain
exceptions--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--the
trustee,
for
most
purposes.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
well,
i
think
this
case
demonstrates
that
that's
not
always
the
case
at
all.
in
this
case
you
don't
have
that.
in
this
case
you
have
the
government
coming
to
a
trustee
and
saying:
we
are
investigating
your
client;
waive
the
privilege
in
our
convenience,
for
our
convenience,
so
we
can
get
at
the
attorneys.
that's
what
happened
here.
that's
all
it
was.
and
as
indicated
previously...
and
i
think
in
response
to
the
government's
argument
today,
i
should
make
at
least
one
or
two
statements.
this
waiver
was
not
only
blind...
and
by
blind
i
mean
not
only
did
the
trustee
not
know
the
information
that
was
sought...
he
didn't
even
know
the
questions
that
were
being
asked.
it
was
also
retroactive.
it
was
an
after
the
fact
waiver,
and
that's
the
difficulty.
if
this
court
says
that
after
the
fact
waivers
are
okay,
that
trustees
can
come
in
and
waive
privilege
of
a
corporation
going
back
to
the
birth
of
the
corporation,
not
just
in
the
period
right
before
bankruptcy
but
ever,
then
i
submit
as
to
the
chilling
effect,
which
the
government
really
has
no
response
to
except
to
say
it's
no
different
from
future
management,
it
is
different,
because
in
a
corporation
if
management
knows
and
if
the
workers
of
that
corporation
know
that
a
stranger
to
the
corporation
elected
by
the
creditors
may
some
day
open
their
secrets
to
the
government
in
making
an
investigation,
they
aren't
going
to
talk.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
oh,
not
friendly
or
buddy-buddy
at
all,
that's
correct.
but
they
presumably
have
a
profit-making
interest
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
in
mind.
and
maybe
that's
the
only
security
there
is,
but
that's
very
different
from
a
trustee,
who
is
himself
subject
to
at
least
some
level
of
supervision
by
the
law
enforcement
authority
of
the
united
states
himself,
saying,
as
the
government
says,
we're
going
to
cooperate
in
a
government
investigation,
with
apparently
no
quid
pro
quo
for
the
corporation,
which
in
non-bankruptcy
is
at
least
what
most
of
i
think
would--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--absolutely.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
well,
they
don't
have
to
waive
the
privilege
in
connection
with
that.
they
have
the
information
themselves.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
absolutely.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
but
your
honor,
the
creditors
can't
do
that,
and
that's
the
difference
when
the
trustee
comes
in
because,
despite
the
paper
fiduciary
duty--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--well,
but
the
creditors
are

one
other...
if
i
may
get
back
to
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked
my
opponent
earlier,
in
terms
of
where
this
attack,
the
attack
we
have
made
on
the
trustee's
exercise
of
the
privilege,
ought
to
have
been
made
procedurally,
in
this
case
i
would
remind
the
court...
and
i
apologize;
it
may
not
be
very
clear
in
the
briefs.
but
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
when
this
waiver,
such
as
it
was,
this
one-line
waiver,
was
submitted
to
the
bankruptcy
court
there
was
no
notice
to
anyone.
there
was
no
proceeding
in
the
bankruptcy
court
surrounding
the
giving
of
this
waiver.
the
adversary
action
from
which
this
appeal
has
been
taken
was
already
in
progress.
it
was
more
than
in
progress.
it
was
already
being
briefed
on
the
question
of
privilege.
and
the
first
time
that
respondents
found
out
that
there
had
been
a
so-called
waiver
was
when
a
supplemental
brief
was
filed
by
the
government
in
that
proceeding
informing
us.
so
there
was
never
really
an
opportunity,
even
assuming
there
was
a
procedure
to
accommodate
it,
for
these
issues
to
be
raised
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
in
the
district
court
on
the
subpoena
enforcement
action,
absolutely,
justice
rehnquist.
that's
when
it
came...
that's
when
we
found
out
about
it,
and
we
were
off
and
running
and
briefing
it
at
that
point.
in
fact,
the
only
arguments...
the
only
opportunity
that
there
really
was
to
present
arguments
was
at
the
oral
argument,
just
because
of
the
time
constraints
in
the
subpoena
enforcement
action.
it
was
very
much
of
a
last
minute
idea,
very
much
as
the
waiver
theory,
at
least
in
terms
of
the
history
of
bankruptcy
law,
is
kind
of
a
last
minute
idea
to
circumvent
what
appears
to
have
been
the
law
for
a
hundred
years,
that
privilege
applies.
and
i
would
point
out,
in
getting
back
to
the
importance
of
protecting
privilege,
whether
it's
individuals
or
corporations,
that
if...
and
i
think
the
upjohn
case...
i
can't
say
it
better
than
this
court
did
in
upjohn.
if
you
don't
have
the
security
of
the
privilege,
if
its
sanctity
is
not
protected,
if
it
is
waivable
on
a
whim
by
a
person
who
is
a
stranger,
by
a
person
who
does
not
even
know
the
questions
that
are
at
issue,
by
a
person
who
makes
assumptions
about
who's
benefited
from
disclosure,
then
the
privilege
isn't
worth
anything
and
the
privilege
is
not
going
to
do
what
the
privilege
is
designed
to
do,
which
is
to
assure
both
sound
advice
from
counsel
and
full
information
to
counsel.
and
this
case--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--nor
would
i,
your
honor.
but
when
that
happens--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--but
when
that
happens,
the
knowledge
that
that
can
happen
in
the
future
is
an
insecurity.
and
today,
when
the
largest
corporations
in
the
country
are
in
danger
of
bankruptcy,
when
institutions
who
haven't
gone
bankrupt
for
30
years
are
suddenly
going
bankrupt,
it's
a
very
immediate
thought.
and
the
rule
contended
for--
mr.
david
a.
epstein
--apparently
not,
your
honor.
the
consequences
of
the
rule
contended
by
the
government
are
simply
much
broader
than
they
submit.
i
submit
that
if
this
court,
whatever
it
says,
if
it
goes
the
other
way,
if
it
rules
against
us
in
this
case
and
says
that
the
privilege
passes,
it
will
pass
for
individuals
too.
it
will
have
to.
the
same
statutes
apply.
the
same
justifications
by
the
government
apply,
to
get
at
fraud.
they're
the
same.
everything
is
the
same.
and
the
consequences
are
simply
worse
for
individuals.
but
what
happened
in
this
case...
and
i
think
your
honors
should
be
aware
of
this...
is
precisely
what
will
be
discouraged
in
the
future.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
bankrupt's
attorneys
who
suggested
to
it
that
they
turn
themselves
in.
and
on
a
saturday
the
attorneys...
it
was
the
attorneys
who
called,
with
the
client's
consent,
called
the
cftc
and
said:
you
better
come
in;
there's
problems
here.
you
wouldn't
have
that,
and
you
wouldn't
have
the
disclosures
to
the
attorneys,
without
the
privilege.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
making
the
attorney
a
witness,
nothing
less.
it
will
change
the
role
of
attorneys
from
that
of
advisors
and
confidants
and
maybe
internal
investigators
to
that
of
an
aid
in
the
government's
war
to
prosecute,
to
prosecute
fraud,
to
prosecute
misfeasance.
it's
a
fine
goal,
but
the
lawyers
for
private
companies
have
a
different
mission
to
fulfil,
and
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
and
to
keep
that
mission
precisely
what
it
has
been.
mr.
david
a.
epstein
absolutely.
what
this...
what
the
government
would
do
would
be
to
take
that
role
and
take
that
choice
from
the
client
and
give
it
to
the
government,
and
that's
why
we
object.
what
lawyers
do...
and
i
think
i'm
basically
through.
i
should
say,
what
lawyers
do
they
do
on
behalf
of
their
client.
but
they
only
do
it
if
they're
allowed
to.
thank
you.
