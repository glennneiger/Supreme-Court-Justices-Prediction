but
really,
the
subpoena
enforcement
proceeding
and
the
bankruptcy
challenge
are
two
different
kinds
of
challenge,
aren't
they?
one
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
trustee
is
not
acting
in
the
best
interest
of
the
estate,
which
i
would
presume
to
be
the
bankruptcy
challenge.
the
subpoena
enforcement
proceeding
would
be
that
of
the
person
whose
testimony
is
to
be
compelled,
and
i
don't
suppose
that
person
is
limited
just
to
claims
that
the
trustee
is
not
acting
in
the
best
interest
of
the
estate.

that

have
been
raised

the

court.

well,
does
he
have
any
real
fiduciary
responsibility
at
all
to
the
people
in
the
position
such
as
mr.
mcghee?
you
speak
of
him
having
fiduciary
responsibilities
to
everybody,
but
that's
much
like
a
fiduciary
responsibility
to
no
one,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
of
prior
management
generally?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
matter
with
that?
if
the
one
party
whom
the
privilege
is
designed
to
protect,
i.e.
the
client,
chooses
to
waive
it,
the
attorney
should
be
an
open
book.

briefing,
you
mean
briefing
in
the
district
court?
