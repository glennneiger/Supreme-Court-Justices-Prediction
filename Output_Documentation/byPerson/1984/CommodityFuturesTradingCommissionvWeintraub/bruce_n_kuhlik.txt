mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
who
is
the
proper
party
to
control
the
attorney-client
privilege
of
a
corporation
in
bankruptcy.
our
position
is
straightforward:
control
over
the
privilege
rests
with
the
corporation's
management.
the
bankruptcy
trustee
manages
the
debtor
corporation
and
therefore
the
trustee
must
have
the
power
to
assert
or
waive
the
corporation's
privilege.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
demise
of
a
commodity
brokerage
firm,
chicago
discount
commodity
brokers.
over
a
period
of
time,
the
firm's
president,
frank
mcghee,
who
is
one
of
the
respondents
in
this
court,
had
embezzled
several
million
dollars
in
customer
funds.
and
by
the
fall
of
1980
the
firm's
finances
were
in
such
disarray
that
the
commodities
futures
trading
commission
filed
a
complaint
in
federal
court
alleging
various
violations
of
the
commodities
exchange
act,
and
the
same
day
that
the
complaint
was
filed
the
brokerage
firm,
through
frank
mcghee,
who
was
at
that
time
its
sole
remaining
officer
and
director,
entered
into
a
consent
decree
with
the
commission
that
provided
for
the
appointment
of
a
receiver.
john
notz
was
appointed
the
receiver
and
he
immediately
took
control
of
the
firm's
operations.
it
quickly
became
clear
to
him
that
really
the
best
course
for
the
firm
was
to
file
for
bankruptcy
and,
pursuant
to
an
express
authorization
in
the
consent
decree,
he
filed
a
voluntary
petition
for
liquidation
under
subchapter
iv
of
chapter
7
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
now,
subchapter
iv
of
chapter
7
is
the
only
bankruptcy
avenue
available
to
commodity
brokers.
they
cannot
go
into
reorganization.
congress
had
two
concerns
when
it
set
forth
that
requirement.
the
first
is
with
the
customers
of
a
commodity
broker,
whose
funds
are
primarily
at
risk.
they
are
the
people
that
put
up
the
margin
payments
and
the
deposits,
and
it's
typically
that
money
that
is
lost
in
a
commodity
brokerage
bankruptcy.
congress
was
also
concerned
that
the
bankruptcy
of
one
commodity
broker
not
have
a
ripple
effect
through
the
complex
and
interdependent
commodity
markets
and
thereby
cause
problems
throughout
the
futures
markets.
so
under
these
special
provisions
the
trustee,
who
was
mr.
notz,
came
in
and
he
operated
the
commodity
brokerage
business
with
a
view
toward
liquidating
it
and
closing
out
its
contracts
in
an
orderly
fashion
as
quickly
as
possible.
pursuant
to
section
766
of
the
code,
the
trustee
in
a
commodity
broker
bankruptcy
must
identify
contracts
that
may
be
transferred
to
solvent
commodity
brokers,
he
must
seek
customer
instructions,
he
must
make
and
meet
margin
payments
daily,
he
must
be
prepared
to
accept
or
to
deliver
commodities
in
contracts
that
cannot
be
closed
out
before
their
closing
dates.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
you
ask
a
number
of
questions,
justice
o'connor.
the
trustee
in
a
bankruptcy
is
a
fiduciary
who
has
a
responsibility
to
all
of
the
parties
in
interest
in
the
proceeding:
the
creditors,
the
shareholders,
the
debtor
corporation.
and
it
is
open
to
any
party
at
any
time
to
challenge
the
actions
of
the
trustee
as
not
being
in
the
best
interests
of
the
estate.
in
fact,
it's
a
fairly
common
occurrence.
people
are
doing
it
all
the
time.
so
in
a
sense,
the
rule
we
are
asking
for
is
a
presumptive
one.
we
feel
that
the
trustee
is
the
best
person
in
the
first
instance
to
make
this
cut.
he
is
obviously
in
a
better
position
in
this
case
than
frank
mcghee.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
well,
not
in
all
circumstances,
and
i
would
note
in
this
particular
case
that
the
mcghee's
have
asserted
the
privilege
or
instructed
their
attorney
to
assert
it
with
respect
to
the
trustee
as
well.
in
this
particular
case,
the
trustee
had
been
pursuing
a
number
of
adversary
actions
and
the
cftc
had
as
well,
and
the
trustee
and
the
cftc
were
both
aware
that
the
mcghee's
were
the
people
who
had
primarily
caused
the
problems
with
this
brokerage
firm.
and
it
was
quite
apparent
to
the
trustee
that
waiver
of
the
privilege
in
favor
of
the
cftc
with
respect
to
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
mr.
weintraub
in
this
deposition
would
be
in
everybody's
best
interest.
but
i
would
emphasize
here
that
this
proceeding
arises
out
of
the
subpoena
enforcement
action.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
well,
he
knows
in
this
case
from
his
experience
in
pursuing
other
actions
against
the
mcghee's
and
other
insiders,
that
information
concerning
access
to
the
safe,
loans
to
corporate
officers
and
the
like,
very,
very
unlikely
that
they
would
redound
to
the
detriment
of
the
estate.
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
question
of
whether
this
will
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
customers,
the
creditors,
the
shareholders.
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
mr.
weintraub
with
respect
to
which
the
privilege
was
asserted
were
questions
that
could
not
possibly
have
hurt
those
groups
of
people.
the
only
people
that
could
have
been
harmed
were
the
insiders
who
engaged...
had
engaged
in
fraudulent
transactions.
i
would
emphasize
here
that
the
cftc
is
statutorily
authorized
to
seek
disgorgement
of
ill-gotten
gains
in
a
proceeding
such
as
this.
so
it
was
quite
apparent
to
the
trustee
that
the
cftc
was
seeking
to
go
along
the
same
lines
that
he
himself
was,
which
was
to
find
the
money.
the
customers
had
put
up
these
funds
for
margin
payments,
for
deposits,
and
this
money
was
supposed
to
be
separated...
"segregated"
is
the
word
that's
used
in
the
statute...
and
not
used
for
any
other
sort
of
trading.
and
what
happened
here
was
that
mr.
mcghee
and
perhaps
other
insiders
had
used
this
money
to
trade
on
their
own
accounts,
and
it
was
quite
apparent
that
the
only
way
this
money
was
going
to
be
recovered
was
to
determine
where
it
had
gone,
what
the
insiders
had
done
with
it.
and
i
would
emphasize,
though,
again
that
this
is
a
subpoena
enforcement
action.
if
the
mcghee's
had
wished
to
challenge
the
propriety
of
the
trustee's
waiver,
there
was
a
place
for
them
to
do
it
and
that
was
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
not
in
the
subpoena
enforcement
court.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
well,
at
any
time,
justice
o'connor,
anyone
may
file
a
motion
with
the
bankruptcy
judge
alleging
that
the
trustee
has
violated
his
fiduciary
duty,
has
not
acted
in
the
best
interest
of
the
estate.
the
trustee,
of
course,
has
to
file
a
bond
at
the
beginning
of
the
action
and
he
is
constantly
subject
to
supervision.
so
that
procedure
would
clearly
be
available
here
or
would
have
been
available
had
they
chosen
to--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--no.
i
would
suggest,
justice
rehnquist,
that
he
doesn't
have
that
option
available
to
him.
he
has
the
legal
option
of
presenting
the
legal
question
here
of
whether
the
trustee
has
the
power
to
act
for
the
corporation
the
way
that
in
a
non-bankruptcy
proceeding,
if
the
board
of
directors
had
waived
the
privilege,
for
example,
it
could
be
contended
that
they
weren't
really
the
board.
and
of
course,
whether
or
not
the
information
was
in
fact
privileged
would
be
a
question
for
the
subpoena
enforcement
court.
but
i
would
strongly
suggest
that
the...
clearly,
the
question
of
whether
the
trustee
acted
here
in
the
best
interest
of
the
estate
is
simply
not
before
this
court.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
on
these
particular
facts.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
yes.
there
may
be
circumstances,
with
procedural
difficulties,
where
it
may
arise
first
in
the
subpoena
enforcement
court,
but
this
is
not...
that
question
simply
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
well,
it's
difficult
to
imagine
anything
that
would
concern
the
corporation's
causes
of
action
that
wouldn't
in
some
way
be
related
to
its
assets.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
don't
see
any
limitation
on
the
trustee's
power,
his
absolute
power,
justice
o'connor,
to
act
for
the
corporation.
that
is
clearly
implicit
in
everything
that
the
trustee
is
given
the
power
to
do
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
as
i
say,
if
the
trustee
in
a
particular
case
has
not
acted
in
the
best
interest
of
everybody,
that
action
may
be
challenged.
the
trustee
in
this
case,
like
other
liquidation
trustees,
has
the
duty
to
maximize
the
value
of
the
estate
for
all
of
the
parties
in
interest.
the
estate
in
a
corporate
bankruptcy
is
composed
of
all
of
the
corporation's
property.
unlike
an
individual,
a
corporation
doesn't
have
any
exempt
property.
everything
goes
into
the
estate.
and
most
significantly
perhaps,
the
estate
includes
the
corporation's
causes
of
action,
its
litigation.
under
section
541
of
the
code
and
under
bankruptcy
rule
6009,
the
trustee
takes
control
of
the
corporation's
litigation,
both
its
causes
of
action
and
its
defenses.
and
it
would
be
completely
anomalous
to
suppose
that
the
person
who
is
in
control
of
the
corporation's
litigation
does
not
have
the
power
to
obtain
and
to
control
its
communications
with
counsel.
it's
simply
impossible
to
see
how
his
function
in
prosecuting
causes
of
action
could
be
carried
out
without
access
to
that
information.
and
in
this
very
case,
i
would
note
that
the
trustee
has
filed
over
time
approximately
75
adversary
actions
seeking
the
recovery
of
approximately
$6
million.
because
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
the
resources
of
the
estate
are
often
quite
limited,
it
would
not
be
unusual
for
a
trustee
to
cooperate
with
the
government
where,
as
here,
it
is
apparent
that
the
government
is
looking
for
the
same
thing
that
the
trustee
is,
which
is
the
missing
money.
and
just
that
sort
of
cooperation
as
we've
been
discussing
was
contemplated
here.
and
after
the
trustee,
at
the
cftc's
request,
waived
the
privilege,
the
district
court
ruled
that
he
must
answer
the
questions
and
the
mcghee's,
frank
mcghee
who
i've
mentioned
and
his
brother
andrew
mcghee,
who
was
a
minority
shareholder
in
the
firm
and
a
former
officer,
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
trustee
does
not
have
the
power,
absolutely
doesn't
have
the
power,
to
waive
the
corporation's
attorney-client
privilege.
this
conflicts
with
decisions
of
the
second,
eighth,
and
ninth
circuits
and
virtually
every
district
and
bankruptcy
court
to
consider
the
question.
now,
our
position
really
can
be
summarized
in
a
nutshell:
the
privilege
of
a
corporation
is
controlled
by
its
management,
its
board
of
directors
or
its
officers
if
they're
authorized
to
so
act
by
the
board.
when
a
new
board
of
directors
takes
over
in
a
non-bankruptcy
case
as
a
result
of
a
takeover
or
a
merger,
shareholder
dissatisfaction
or
the
like,
it
takes
control
of
the
privilege.
it
has
access
to
the
privileged
communications.
it
can
waive
the
privilege.
that
much
is
settled
corporate
law
and
it's
undisputed
by
the
parties
here.
so
the
question
is
who
manages
a
debtor
corporation
in
bankruptcy
when
a
trustee
has
been
appointed.
there
can
really
only
be
one
answer:
it's
the
trustee.
as
i've
noted,
the
trustee
has
power
to
exercise...
can
exercise
power
over
all
of
the
corporate
property.
he's
under
the
direct
supervision
of
the
bankruptcy
court
in
this
regard.
he
operates
the
business
in
a
commodity
brokerage
bankruptcy.
he
can
operate
the
business
in
other
liquidations,
with
the
approval
of
the
court.
he
has
a
specific
duty
to
investigate
former
management
to
reveal
causes
of
action,
to
set
aside
preferential
transfers
and
fraudulent
conveyances.
as
i've
said,
he
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
debtor
corporation
in
prosecuting
and
defending
its
causes
of
action.
we
don't
think
he
could
do
any
of
these
things
without--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--an
individual
bankruptcy,
justice
o'connor,
raises
quite
different
concerns,
as
we
noted
in
our
reply
brief.
an
individual's
privilege
is
personal
to
himself.
there
isn't
a
management
that
controls
the
privilege
for
him.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
my
answer
is
that
that
is
a
question
that
does
not
have
to
be
decided
here.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
justice
o'connor,
i
do
not
think
as
a
matter
of
course
that
in
every
circumstance
a
bankruptcy
trustee
should
be
able
to
waive
an
individual's
privilege.
there
may
be
circumstances
that
arise
in
an
individual
bankruptcy
that
require
such
a
result.
but
my
main
point
is
that
whatever
the
court
does
here
will
not
require
a
result
one
way
or
the
other
in
an
individual
case.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
justice
o'connor,
that's
exactly
the
situation
where
the
trustee
would
not
waive
the
privilege.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
would
suggest
the
facts
of
this
case
may
be
somewhat
unusual
in
that
the
trustee
did
not
have
the
information
before
him
when
he
made
the
waiver,
and
that
in
most
circumstances
one
would
hope
that
the
trustee
would
have
the
information.
but
even
the
nature
of
the
request
and
the
requesting
party
would
probably
give
a
fairly
good
clue
as
to
what
was
being
sought
and
what
it
might
be
used
for.
but
the
trustee's
fiduciary
duties
and
his
responsibilities--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
we
make
that
as
an
alternative
argument.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
that
is
correct.
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
that
argument,
we
feel
it
would
apply
to
the
individual.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
if
you
decide
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--that
is
an
alternative
position.
it
is
not
my
preferred
position,
justice
stevens.
my
position--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--many--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--we
believe
that
the
most
reasoned
approach
to
this
and
the
one
that
makes
the
most
sense
is
to
find
that
the
trustee
is
the
management
of
the
corporation
and
controls
the
privilege
in
that
capacity.
a
number
of
lower
courts
have
reasoned
that
the
privilege
is
an
asset
of
the
estate
and
we
present
that
for
your
consideration.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
believe
that
would
follow,
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
justice
marshall,
the
answer
to
that
question
depends
on
whether
the
privilege
is
necessary
to
realize
the
acquired
interest.
it's
a
form
of
property
law.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
believe
the
cases--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--i'm
sorry,
justice
marshall?
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
if
you
pass
along
a
property
right
that
the
privilege
is
necessary
to--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--no.
if
you
pass
along,
if
you
convey
to
someone
an
interest
in
property
that
itself
requires
control
over
the
privilege
to
realize
that
interest,
then
the
privilege
goes
as
well.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
suggest
i'm
not
trying
to
suggest
here
absolutely
that
the
individual
should
control
the
privilege.
we're
far
more
interested
in
what
is
presented
in
this
case,
which
is
the
corporate
privilege,
and
i
simply
suggest
that
our
management
theory,
which
does
not
depend
on
a
conveyance
of
assets
and
is
not
directly
applicable
to
the
individual
situation,
does
not
apply...
if
what
it
takes...
if
the
court
believes
that
it
cannot
distinguish
between
the
corporation
and
the
individual's
privilege,
we
would
do
without
the
individual's
privilege.
but
we
believe
that
it
is
reconcilable
and
that
there
are
situations
perhaps,
that
the
court
simply
need
not
reach
right
now,
with
respect
to
the
individual
privilege.
the
bankruptcy
trustee's
duty
to
maximize
the
value
of
the
estate
is
precisely
analogous
to
the
duty
of
management
outside
of
bankruptcy
to
maximize
the
profits
of
the
corporation.
and
respondents
raise
the
possibility
of
conflict
between
creditors
and
shareholders,
and
i
would
like
to
put
that
to
rest.
in
a
liquidation
proceeding
such
as
this
one,
everybody
desires
exactly
the
same
thing,
to
maximize
the
value
of
the
estate.
the
corporation's
property
is
being
sold
off.
it
is
not
going
to
exist
in
the
future
in
any
meaningful
sense.
the
only
way
anybody
is
going
to
get
paid
is
to
make
that
sum
of
money
that
the
property
is
sold
for
as
large
as
possible,
and
everybody
wants
that.
more
fundamentally,
though,
the
respondents'
argument
relies
more
on
form
than
the
substance
of
the
matter.
the
substance
of
the
matter
is
that
management's
duties
run
to
owners.
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
creditors
are
owners.
they
have
an
ownership
interest
in
the
property
just
like
shareholders
do.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
sure.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
it
is
absolutely
a
usual
practice
for
corporate
counsel
in
a
situation
like
that
to
advise
corporate
officers
that
they
are
not
the
ones
who
control
whether
their
communications
will
be
disclosed.
that's
true
with
respect
to
bankruptcy
proceedings,
in
contemplation
of
a
takeover
bid,
any
other
sort
of
investigation.
that
is
what
counsel
do,
as
we
point
out
in
footnote
52
in
our
brief.
and
it
wouldn't
be
any
different
here.
justice
stevens,
i
think
you're
raising
perhaps--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--they
should
definitely
tell
them
and
they
do.
i
think
what
you're
raising,
though,
is
perhaps
the
possibility
that
attorney-client
communications
would
be
chilled,
and
i
want
to
address
that
very
briefly.
all
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
apply
the
same
rule
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
that's
applied
out
of
bankruptcy,
and
that
is
that
management
controls
the
privilege.
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
existence
of
the
privilege
or
its
scope.
all
we
ask
is
that
you
not
upset
the
balance
struck
in
non-bankruptcy
corporate
law,
which
is
that
current
management
controls
the
privilege.
in
any
event,
the
chilling
effect
that
is
suggested
really
disappears
upon
analysis.
i
would
emphasize
to
the
court
that
in
reorganization
proceedings,
which
are
the
method
of
choice
for
bankruptcies
for
corporations,
the
presumption
is
against
having
a
trustee.
the
presumption
is
that
the
officers
and
directors
will
stay
in
as
the
debtor
in
possession
and
control
the
corporation
even
in
bankruptcy.
when
they
are
not
in
possession,
when
a
trustee
has
been
appointed,
it
is
often
because
former
management
was
fraudulent
or
grossly
inadequate.
so
if
counsel...
or
if
corporate
employees
were
to
consider
the
possibility
of
bankruptcy,
i
would
suggest
that
that
possibility
itself
might
be
remote.
but
equally
importantly,
the
possibility
of
having
a
trustee
is
quite
remote
in
most
proceedings.
moreover,
the
trustee
won't
necessarily
waive
the
privilege.
if
the
employee
is
concerned
about
corporate
liability,
he
can
rest
assured
that
the
trustee
will
act
in
the
best
interests
of
the
estate,
just
as
would
management
outside
of
bankruptcy.
and
finally,
as
you
suggested,
justice
stevens,
corporate
counsel
could
inform
the
employee
of
the
possibility
that
the
privilege
might
be
lost,
that
he
doesn't
control
it,
and
suggest
that
the
employee
seek
his
own
counsel
as
well
if
that
is
necessary.
in
sum,
where
a
trustee
is
appointed
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
the
officers
and
directors
have
no
managerial
role
to
play,
either
in
terms
of
their
powers
or
their
duties.
their
role
is
minimal
and
ministerial.
they
must
turn
over
the
property
of
the
corporation
to
the
trustee
and,
significantly,
under
section
521
of
the
code,
there's
no
provision
made
for
assertion
of
a
privilege
against
the
trustee
by
the
debtor
corporation.
the
officers
and
directors
or
one
of
their
delegates
must
appear
for
examination
by
the
creditors.
but
that's
really
it.
anything
else
they
do
in
practical
terms
tends
to
further
their
own
interests.
if
the
shareholders
wish
to
have
their
interests
furthered,
they
can
form
a
committee,
just
as
creditors
have
committees,
and
seek
to
assert
their
interests
that
way.
but
the
former
management
itself
has
really
been,
as
the
house
report
says,
"completely
ousted"
in
favor
of
the
trustee.
they
don't
have
any
say
in
the
corporation's
liquidation...
or
litigation,
rather.
they
are
likely
to
be
the
people
most
likely
to
have
a
conflict
of
interest
with
respect
to
the
communications.
the
trustee,
by
contrast,
is
a
court-supervised
fiduciary
who
has
responsibilities
to
the
entire
community
of
interests
in
the
estate.
he
is
the
person
who
can
be
relied
upon
to
exercise
it
in--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--justice
rehnquist,
he
has
fiduciary
responsibilities
to
everyone
who
has
an
interest
in
the
estate.
that
is,
the
creditors,
the
customers,
the
shareholders.
he
does
not
have
a
fiduciary
responsibility
to
act
in
the
best
interests
of
mr.
mcghee,
which
is
all
that
mr.
mcghee
is
concerned
with.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
that's
true.
he
must
act
in
the
best
interests
of
everyone
who
currently
has
an
interest
in
the
property.
it's
a
consequence
of
the
corporation's
own
continuing
existence.
and
as
the
management
of
the
debtor
corporation,
the
trustee
is
entitled
in
our
view
to
control
over
its
attorney-client
privilege.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
have
nothing
further.
i'd
be
pleased
to
answer
any
questions.
