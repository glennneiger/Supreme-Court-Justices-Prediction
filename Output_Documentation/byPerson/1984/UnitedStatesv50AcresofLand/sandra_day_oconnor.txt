justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
schwartz,
i
guess
there
is
language
in
our
cases
that
something
other
than
fair
market
value
can
be
used
in
two
instances:
one,
if
you
don't
have
a
fair
market
value,
which
you
have
been
discussing;
or
secondly,
where
it
is
manifestly
unjust
to
the
owner
or
the
public
to
apply
a
fair
market
value
principle.
now,
did
the
court
below
attempt
to
analyze
this
case
within
that
framework
to
determine
whether
it
is
manifestly
unjust
here
to
use
fair
market
value?
justice
o'connor
could,
could
a
case
like
this,
where
you
are
taking
a
landfill,
for
example,
or
some
other
public
facility
that
must
be
replaced,
would
it
ever
be
appropriate
to
analyze
it
in
terms
of
that
manifestly
unjust
standard?
could
it
fit?
justice
o'connor
well,
okay,
would
it
include
the
fact
that
inevitably
this
local
government
is
going
to
have
to
acquire
a
substitute
because
it
is
under
an
obligation
to
dispose
of
trash
and
garbage;
and
secondly,
because
it
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
substantial
additional
expenditure
to
do
it
over
and
above
acquiring
the
land,
if
those
were
the
facts?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
may
have
a
more
immediate
necessity.
if
what
has
been
taken
is
the
public
water
supply
or
the,
in
this
case,
sanitary
landfill,
the
city
or
the
county
has
an
obligation
tomorrow
to
have
something
in
place
to
take
care
of
that.
justice
o'connor
the
homeowner
can
go
rent
something
temporarily.
sure,
you
need
a
place
to
live,
but
it
is
not
the
same.
the
public
entity
has
an
obligation
to
keep
these
public
services
going.
now,
can
that
be
a
factor
in
determining
what
is
manifestly
unjust?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
cost
of
the
substitute
was
significantly
less?
it
might
be
to
the
government's
advantage
to
compel
a
substitute
facility
cost
measure
because
you
could
pay
the
local
government
less.
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
mr.
nichols,
i
guess
your
city
had
the
right
to
go
out
and
condemn
another
parcel
and
take
it
right
away.
justice
o'connor
or
a
prison.
justice
o'connor
now,
would
the
cost
of
that
be
includable
in
the
substitute
cost
figure
that
you
would
urge?
justice
o'connor
and
that
the
ca
5
would
allow
to
be
considered
on
remand?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
this
case
fits
that
proviso?
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
appear
to
me
at
least
to
be
making
a
determination
on
the
manifest
unjust
result
basis.
