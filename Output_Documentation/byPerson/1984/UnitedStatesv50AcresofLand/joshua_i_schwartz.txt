mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
when
the
united
states
takes
property
belonging
to
a
state
or
local
government
for
federal
use
it
is
obliged
by
the
just
compensation
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
pay
compensation
measured
by
reference
to
the
cost
of
a
substitute
facility
rather
than
the
usual
standard
in
condemnation
cases,
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
that
was
taken
by
the
united
states,
even
though
in
the
particular
case
a
market
exists
for
the
kind
of
property
that
was
taken
and
it
is
found
that
the
fair
market
value
measure
is
reasonably
ascertainable
in
the
particular
case.
the
court
of
appeals
answered
the
question
in
the
affirmative;
the
government
contends
that
the
answer
should
be
no.
the
case
arises
from
the
taking
of
a
50
acre
site
occupied
by
a
sanitary
landfill,
occupied
by
the
respondent,
the
city
of
duncanville,
texas.
that
site
was
taken,
along
with
an
adjacent
site
which
was
in
private
ownership
prior
to
the
taking
to
accommodate
a
corps
of
engineers
flood
control
project,
the
site
would
be
flooded
by
the
project,
and
therefore
the
united
states
was
obliged
to
pay
compensation
for
it.
the
taking
was
carried
out
pursuant
to
the
so-called
quick
take
provisions
of
the
declaration
of
taking
act,
which
was
effective
on
october
3,
1978.
estimated
just
compensation
of
just
under
$200,000
was
deposited
into
the
registry
of
the
court,
and
it
was
later
released
to
respondent.
following
the
taking,
respondent
employed
a
temporary
landfill
site
which
was
in
private
ownership
for
an
interim
period
and
later,
approximately
two
years
later,
began
to
use
a
new
site
located
in
ellis
county,
texas,
consisting
of
somewhat
over
113
acres
that
it
had
purchased
and
used
as
a
substitute
site.
the
usable
capacity
of
the
substitute
site,
according
to
the
uncontradicted
evidence,
was
somewhat
greater
than
three
times
that
of
the
site
that
the
united
states
had
acquired
from
the
city
of
duncanville.
a
dispute
arose
in
the
district
court
between
the
parties
as
to
the
proper
measure
of
compensation
for
the
taking.
the
government
contended
that
the
usual
fair
market
value
standard
should
be
applied.
respondent
claimed
that
it
was
entitled
to
recover
the
entire
sum
that
it
alleged
it
had
expended
and
would
in
the
future
expend
in
improving...
in
acquiring
and
improving
the
substitute
site
in
ellis
county.
the
district
court
was
unwilling
to
resolve
the
issue
at
the
threshold.
instead,
it
determined
to
allow
both
theories
to
go
to
the
jury.
both
parties
were
allowed
to
present
evidence
in
support
of
their
respective
theories.
the
jury
was
asked
by
special
questions
to
return
alternative
verdicts:
one,
the
finding
of
substitute
facilities
standard
of
compensation;
the
other,
the
fair
market
value
measure
of
compensation.
the
jury's
verdicts
were
$723,000,
a
bit
over
$723,000
for
a
substitute
facilities
measure,
and
$225,000
for
the
fair
market
value
measure.
the
district
court
then
proceeded
to
enter
judgment
against
the
united
states,
but
on
the
government's
theory
as
to
the
amount
of
just
compensation,
the
district
court
held
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
fair
market
value
is
ascertainable
and
it
is
found
that
a
market
exists
for
the
property
of
the
kind
taken,
that
is
the
measure
that
is
required
to
be
employed
under
this
court's
decisions;
and
furthermore,
the
district
court
found
that
the
respondent
had
not
ever
carried
its
burden
of
presenting...
had
not
in
any
event
presented
a
prima
facie
case
as
to
what
a
reasonable
substitute
facilities
compensation
award
might
be,
the
district
court
observing
that
the
only
testimony
proffered
by
respondent
pertained
to
the
site
they
had
actually
acquired,
a
site
that
was
three
times
as
large
as
the
site
that
was
taken,
and
the
district
court
also
observing
that
the
testimony
suggested
that
respondent
had
paid
in
excess
of
fair
market
value
for
its
substitute
site.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
conceded
that
this
case
was,
in
their
language,
rather
different
from
a
typical
substitute
facilities
case
in
that
in
this
case
fair
market...
there
was
no
claim
that
fair
market
value
was
either
unavailable
or
unworkable;
nevertheless
concluded
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
have
its
compensation
measured
by
reference
to
the
cost
of
the
substitute
facility.
the
court
of
appeals
did
attach
a
significant
caveat,
however,
to
that
holding.
it
held
that
respondent
was
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
advantages
that
accrued
from
purchasing
a
larger
site,
and
that
on
remand,
the
case
was
remanded
for
a
new
trial
so
that
on
remand
the
jury
could
be
instructed
to
make
an
appropriate
deduction
from
the
substitute
facility
cost
to
wash
out
the
windfall
that
might
otherwise
result
from
the
fact
that
the
respondent
had
purchased
a
more,
a
larger
and
more
capacious
landfill
site.
the
government's
position,
as
it
has
been
throughout
this
case,
is
that
the
fair
market
value
standard,
which
is
ordinarily
preferred
in
this
court's
cases,
is
the
proper
measure
of
compensation
for
the
taking
of
respondent's
landfill
site.
in
the
final
analysis,
our
submission
is
that
what
is
lacking
in
the
court
of
appeals
rationale
and
in
respondent's
argument
is
any
explanation
of
what
is...
what
is
defective
about
the
preferred
fair
market
value
standard
of
compensation.
it
does
not
seem
to
be
controverted
that
the
court's
decisions
establish
that
the
fair
market
value
standard
is
the
preferred
mechanism.
the
court's
cases
make
two
essential
points
in
support
of
that
proposition.
the
first
is
that
market
value
assists,
in
an
economy
such
as
ours,
measures
what
justice
frankfurter
called
the
external...
has
in
it
what
justice
frankfurter
called
the
external
validity
of
values
that
make
it
a
fair
measure
of
public
obligation
to
compensate
the
loss
incurred
by
a
property
owner
as
a
result
of
the
taking
of
his
property
for
public
use.
the
point
is
that
various
individuals
may
have
different
use
values
for
property,
but
if
we
are
to
have
any
common
standard
and
a
just
compensation
clause
that
says
the
government
must
pay
someone
for
its
property,
there
has
to
be
a
kind
of
lingua
franca,
a
common
standard
of
compensation,
and
justice
frankfurter
explained
and
the
court
has
quite
uniformly
held
that
fair
market
value
provides
that
objective
standard.
the
court
has
also
observed
that
the
fair
market
value
standard
has
the
considerable
advantage
of
case
of
administration,
although
it
is
not...
there
are
always
arguments
as
to
what
fair
market
value
might
be
in
a
particular
case,
the
method
is
relatively
easy
to
apply
and
has
less
complications
and
speculations
associated
with
it
than
competing
methods.
the
court
has,
however,
recognized
two
situations
in
which
fair
market
value
may...
a
departure
from
fair
market
value
may
be
warranted.
the
first
is
the
situation
where
a
market
simply
does
not
exist
for
the
kind
of
property
that
was
taken,
and
this
exception,
it
has
been
noted,
may
well
apply
to
cases
where
taking
of
public
property
such
as
a
condemnation
of
a
bridge,
a
sewer
line
or
a
road
which
frequently
simply
do
not
exist
or
don't
have
any
counterparts
in
the
private
sector.
the
court's
opinion
in
the
lutheran
synod
case
suggests,
although
it
does
not
hold,
that
in
that
kind
of
case
it
may
be
appropriate
to
use
a
substitute
facilities
measure
of
compensation,
and
in
fact,
the
government
concedes
that
point
in
our
brief
in
those
case,
and
it
seems
only
reasonable
where
fair
market
value
simply
is
not
a
workable
system,
or
market
value
in
one
sense
simply
doesn't
exist,
it
is
pointless
to
insist
that
the
courts
apply
it.
but
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case,
just
as
there
is
no--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--well,
our
question...
a
value
could
be
placed
on
it,
but
our...
the
problem
is
what
would
the
right
kind
of
testimony
be?
the
usual
methods
of
establishing
the
normal
fair
market
value
standard,
which
is
to
look
to
what
a
hypothetical
buyer
would
pay
a
hypothetical
seller,
are
very
difficult
to
apply
because
no
one
would
buy
a
sewer
line,
or
it
is
at
least
typically
assumed
that
no
one
would
buy,
no
one--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--there
haven't
been
any
sales,
there's
no
income
from
the
property
to
capitalize,
so
that
the...
to
say
that
a
jury
properly...
a
trier
of
fact
properly
instructed
with
the
proper
evidence
is
to
beg
the
question.
the
question
is
what
proper
evidence
there
would
be
in
developing--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
i
disagree
with
what
you
said.
our
point
is
that
the
substitute
facilities
measure
which
we
concede
is
applicable
to
that
kind
of
taking
of
public
property
is
really
not
any
different
from
a
reproduction
cost
measure
which
is
sometimes
applied
in
the
taking
of
private
property.
you
do
the
same,
although
the
labels
are
different
in
each
case,
when
no
comparables
are
available
and
perhaps
there
is
no
income
to
capitalize,
you
lock
at
what
it
would
cost
to
build
the
substitute,
and
then
you
discount
for
the...
for
either
depreciation
or
the
added
value
of
the--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--it's
a
fair
value,
and
i
don't...
i
think
it's...
i'm
not
sure
it
makes
all
that
much
difference.
it
is
true
that
terminologically,
for
reasons
that
may
be
perfectly
arbitrary,
the
courts
have
referred
to
reproduction
costs
as
the
third
and
least
preferred
of
the
fair
market
value
methods.
it
is
in
a
sense
quite
different
from
the
others,
and
if
we
wanted
to
use
the
label
substitution
costs,
both
for
a
private
case
in
which
reproduction
cost
is
appropriate,
as
the
last
alternative,
the
alternative
of
last
resort,
and
for
public
cases
where
it
is
the
alternative
of
last
resort,
the
law
wouldn't
be
any
different.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
just
a
semantic
question.
in
any
event,
we
tried
to
make
clear
in
our
brief
that
the
kind
of
situation
where
substitute
facilities
is
appropriate
for
a
public
entity
is
the
same
kind
of
situation
where
reproduction
costs
would
be
appropriate
for
a
private
entity.
we
don't
see
it
as
a
principle
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
entity
that
owns
the
property
taken,
in
other
words.
it
is
a
principle
that
has
to
do
with
the
market...
whether
there
will
be
evidence
available
as
to
what
the
market
would
bear
for
that
kind
of
property.
but
the
point
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
that
this
is
not
that
kind
of
case.
it
is
conceded
that
their
fair
market
value
was
ascertainable.
in
fact,
respondent's
expert
witnesses
testified
that
this
landfill
site
would
have
sold
in
the
open
market,
and
they
adduced
comparable
sale
evidence,
and
they
assigned
the
fair
market
value
to
the
property.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
no.
the
court--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--your
honor,
i
hesitate
to
say
no,
never,
but
i
think
the
pertinent
question
that
needs
to
be
answered
is
why
would
it
be...
try
to
understand
why
it
might
be
manifestly
unjust
in
a
particular
case,
and
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
respondent
has
explained
why
it
might
be
manifestly
unjust.
but
it
seers
to
me
that
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
that
have
been
thrown
out--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
are
not
satisfied
that
either
of
those
would
establish
the
kind
of
manifest
injustice,
and
i
would
like
to...
that
the
court
has
in
mind,
to
the
best
of
my
understanding,
and
i
would
like
to
explain
why
that
is
so.
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
the
first
of
the
points
that
you
made.
although
they
didn't
actually
say
that
there
was
an
impermissible
or
unjust
divergence
between
the
so-called
indemnity
principle
of
just
compensation
and
fair
market
value,
they
did,
but
in
distinguishing
this
court's
decision
in
lutheran
synod
say,
this
case
is
different
because
there's
an
obligation
to
replace
the
property.
we
don't
think
that
the
obligation
to
replace
the
property
is
a
sufficient
distinction
for
several
reasons,
and
most
of
what
i
have
to
say
follows
the
line
of
analysis
that
is
in
justice
white's
concurring
opinion
in
the
lutheran
synod
case.
certainly
private
entities
frequently
have
either
a
legal...
may
well
have
legal
obligations
to
replace
property,
and
in
any
event,
certainly
have
the
same
pragmatic
imperatives
to
replace
property
that
a
public
condemnee
may
experience.
the
court's
opinion
in
lutheran
synod
points
out
that
noncommercial
property
owners,
the
most
obvious
and
important
example
of
which
is
homeowners,
hold
their
property
for
use
and
not
for
its
stream
of
income
or
its
investment
value,
typically,
and
certainly
if
the
highway
department
puts
an
interstate
highway
through
your
home,
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
any
greater
imperative
to
replace
that
home,
and
i
submit
that
irrespective
of
legal
or
practical
obligation,
a
public
body
such
as
respondent
doesn't
have
a
greater
necessity
to
replace
the
facility.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
the
homeowner
has
an
equal--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--it
still
seems
to
me
that
you
need
something
else.
in
fact,
the
argument
made
in
lutheran
synod
which
the
court
found
to
be
factually
inapplicable
there,
that
the
necessity
of
replacement
might,
the
court
said
might,
and
expressly
reserved
the
question
which
we
have
here
today,
might
be
sufficient
to
show
injustice,
was
based
on
two
claims:
one,
the
claim
of
need
to
replace,
and
second,
the
claim
that
the
replacement
facility
would
for
some
significant
reason
beyond
the
local...
the
condemnee's
control,
be
greater
than
the
fair
market
value.
unless
there
is
that
disparity
in
existence,
it
seems
logically
irrelevant
to
worry
about
whether
you
need
to
replace
it
because
fair
market
value
should
be
a
sufficient
replacement.
in
this
case
neither
the
respondent
nor
the
court
of
appeals
has
explained
why
it
is
that
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
a
replacement
site
is
more
expensive.
if
that
is
not
so,
fair
market
value
doesn't
impose
a
hardship,
and
the
reed
to
replace,
while
it
may
be
relevant,
is
not
a
sufficient
condition
for--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
are
aware
of
that,
and
in
our
brief
we
have
made
our
choice.
we
concede
that
the
fair
market
value
standard
is
the
applicable
one.
the
cases
generally
suggest
that
that
is
true,
that
fair
market
value
should
be
paid
when
it
is
in
excess
of
the
substitute
facility's
cost,
and
the
reasoning
behind
that
is
whether
or
not
the
municipality
actually
chooses
to
make
that
use
of
its
property,
if
it
owns
property
and
has
the
legal
right
to
sell
it,
it
has...
it
could,
at
least
hypothetically,
sell
it
in
the
marketplace,
take
the
money,
and
then
recreate
that...
carry
out
its
function
at
another
site.
and
we
agreed
that
the
rule
must
work
both
ways,
and
yet
we
suggest
that
it
ought
to
work
in
the
manner
that
fair
market
value
is
the
standard
either
way.
in
fact,
i
was
going
to
point
out
it
is
our
submission
that
it
is
possible
to
read
the
record
to
suggest
that
in
this
case
the
respondent
may
well
be
receiving
quite
a
fair
shake,
quite
an
advantageous
deal
by
getting
fair
market
value
compensation.
respondent's
claim
for
a
far
greater
sum
is
based
on
its
testimony
as
to
what
it
actually
paid
for
its
replacement
site.
that
testimony
was
that
they
paid
some
$583,000
for
the
site,
but
the
government's
appraisers
who
testified
on
that
question,
who
were
the
only
ones
who
testified
as
to
what
the
fair
market
value
of
that
site
was,
said
that
it
was
not
in
excess
of
$200,000.
so
that
is
obviously
one
of
the
defects
in
this--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--the
truth
is,
your
honor,
we
don't
have
any
way
of
knowing.
the
jury
picked
a
number
that
was
much
lower
than
respondent's
claim
and
much
higher
than
ours,
and
one
of
the
problems
that
we
see
in
a
substitute
facilities
standard,
even
if
it
is
corrected,
as
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
it
had
to
be,
by
a
far
more
rigorous
instruction
than
was
actually
given,
that
some
discounting
was
needed,
it
is
still
quite
difficult
to
know
how
the
jury
will
proceed,
and
we
relieve
that
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
unfair
prejudice
to
the
united
states
because
the
jury
or
other
trier
of
fact
will
be
confronted
with
some...
could
be
confronted
with
some
very
large
numbers.
and
again,
even
if
they...
we
just
don't
see
the
need
to
depart
from
the
fair
market
value
system.
but
if
i
could
continue
to
explain
where
i
am
going,
the
other
fact
which
appears
to
be
undisputed
here
is
that
the
new
site
was
three
times...
had
three
times
the
useful
life
of
the
old
site.
if
you
put
that
fact
together
with
the
evidence
that
suggests
this
site
had
a
fair
market
value
of
one
third
of
what
was
actually
paid,
one
could
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
substitute
facilities
cost,
the
reasonable
substitute
facilities
cost
for
an
equivalent
facility
may
have
been
less
than
the
fair
market
value.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
that
on...
on
that
we
have
several
difficulties.
the
first
thing
is
the
court
of
appeals
said--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--the
court
of
appeals
said
that--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--well,
there
is
some
possibility
of
that.
there
are
several
reasons
for
being
concerned
that
that
is
not
an
adequate
response.
the
first
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
prescribe
how
this
should
be
done.
it
said
one
way
you
might
do
it
is
the
way
the
second
circuit
suggested
in
a
case
called
certain
property
in
the
borough
of
manhattan,
which
requires
a
quite
mechanical
discounting
for
the
added
lifetime,
and
the
government
obviously
would
be
far
better
protected
under
that
system
than
it
would
be
under
the
instruction
given
here.
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
explicitly
declined
to
require
that.
and
that
obviously
gives
us
unease.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
it
did,
but
it
placed
us
in
quite
a
grey
area,
where
we
do
not
see...
and
the
other...
and
of
course,
there
is
also
the
question
of
the
court
of
appeals'
other
adjustment.
the
court
of
appeals
said
yes,
it
may
be
that
the
price
paid
for
a
substitute
facility
was
unreasonable
in
this
case.
that
is
a
question
for
the
jury.
the
question
is
how
is
the
jury
to
decide
that?
we
would
submit
the
only
way
a
jury
can
know
whether
a
price
is
reasonable
is
to
lock
at
the
fair
market
value
of
a
substitute
facility.
but
that
entails
a
new
item
of
complication,
that
is,
to
present
comparable
sales
as
to
the
new
facility.
and
that
in
fact
happened
in
this
case,
a
point
which
i
regret
not
emphasizing
in
my
brief.
the
government's
appraisers
went
out
and
did
two
sets
of
appraisals.
they
appraised
comparable
sales
to
establish
the
value,
the
fair
market
value
of
the
substitute
site
and
found
that
what
had
been
paid
was
grossly
in
excess
of
fair
market
value.
but
if
you
are
going
to
make
that
adjustment
and
you
are
going
to
make
the
other
adjustment,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
essentially
two
possibilities.
either
it
will
be
done
rigorously
and
you
will
have
gone
all
the
way
around
the
barn
and
ended
up
back
where
you
started
out,
or
else
somewhere
along
the
line
some
prejudice
to
the
government
will
have
crept
in
because
it
wasn't
done
rigorously,
because
the
jury
was
dazzled
by
some
large
numbers
that
were
brought
out.
those
things
suggest
to
us
that
there
is
no
reason
to
change
what
the
court
has
called
a
clear,
easily
administrable
rule.
no
suggestion...
there
has
been
no
showing
here
that
the
kind
of
manifest
injustice
that
the
court
has
suggested
might
be
relevant
actually
arose
here.
the
kinds
of
reasons
that
have
typically
been
suggested
as
to
why
there
might
be
unjustice
seem
to
us
insufficient.
if
you
pay
an
unreasonable
price
for
a
substitute
site,
it
is
not
unjust
that
the
condemnee
bear
that
price.
if
you
take
a
much
larger,
more
valuable
substitute
site,
it
seems
to
us
not
unjust
that
the
condemnee
should,
which
has
the
benefit
of
what
it
bought
with
that
extra
cost,
should
bear
that.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we...
the
government
presented
a...
presented
evidence
to
challenge
many
of
the
items
in
this
list
of
figures
which
is
in
the
petition
appendix
at
16a
and
17a
that
the
respondent
presented,
and
i
think
we
seriously
challenged
in
the
jury's
eyes
many
of
those
figures.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--well,
i
don't
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
we
did
it
as
well
as
we
could.
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
we
were
handicapped
by
an
improper
district
court
instruction
which
did
not
direct
the
jury
to
do
what
it
should
have
done.
but
the
other
thing
is
the
government
made
a
deliberate
choice
not
to
go
through
cost
by
cost
because
the
government,
while
it
was
interested
in
protecting
its
flank,
did
not
choose
to
try
this
case
entirely
on
the
two
alternative
theories;
only
partially
so.
we
did
what
we
thought
was
necessary
to
let
some
of
the
air
out
of
the
other
side's
case,
and
yet
we
did
not
want
to
present
a...
take
them,
take
the
jury
all
the
way
around
the
barn
ourselves.
it
seemed
to
us
that
that
was--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--well,
we
don't
really
know
what
that
will
amount
to.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
my
understanding
of
the
terms
of
the
remand
is
that
we
will
have
an
entirely
new
trial,
so
i
don't
suppose
the
government
would
be
stuck,
but
again,
if
i
may
make
the
point--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
persuaded
by
the
government's
argument
to
this
extent,
that
there
was
a
fundamental
lack
of
a
proper
standard
in
the
district
court's
instruction,
so
there
was
no
telling
what
that
$750,000
represented,
whether
it
just
represented
some
ad
hoc
notion
of
compromise.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
that
would
be
our
submission.
the
court's
cases,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
have
always
held
open
the
possibility
that
some
other
kind
of
unjustice
could
be
demonstrated.
our
submission
is
simply
that
nothing
of
that
kind
has
been
shown
here.
we
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
decide
that
there
could
never
be
any
other
circumstance,
but
nothing
in
the
nature
of
the
taking
of
a
public
property
where
fair
market
value
exists
and
is
readily
ascertainable
presents
that
kind
of
unjustice.
and
that
seems
to
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--an
airport
case
might
be,
although
it
might
be
that
there...
that
a
low...
as
an
airport
has
some
special
features,
a
large,
assembled
tract,
but
it
might
be
that,
depending
on
the
area
you
are
in,
that
plain,
raw,
undeveloped
land
would
essentially
be
fungible.
it
would
be
a
question
of
the
improvements.
it
would
be
a
factual
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
were
comparable
sales,
and
i
don't
think
i
can
give
a
categorical
answer.
that
is
the
kind
of
a
case
in
which--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i
would
think
so,
although
maybe
in
some
areas
a
small
private,
relatively
small
airport
might
be
different.
i
don't
think
i
can
give
a
categorical
answer
to
that.
but
that
would
be
the
kind
of
case
in
which
it
would
be
open
to
contend
that
the
fair
market
value
standard
really
isn't
workable.
and
this
case,
we
submit,
is
quite
different.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
a
few
factual
points
if
time
permits.
justice
stevens,
the
question
about
the
applicability
of
the
just
compensation
clause
to
taking
of
publicly
owned
property
is
addressed
at
page
16
of
our
brief
at
note
9.
justice
white,
the
cross-petition
that
was
filed
in
this
case,
i
just
want
to
remind
the
court,
concerned
a
procedural
question
about
the
plain
error
rule.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i
think--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i
think
that's
right.
those
cases
did
not
address
it,
and
lutheran
synod
suggests
that
that
is
an
open
question.
justice
o'connor,
you
mentioned
a
point
which
we
think
significant.
the
public
condemnee
is
better
off
than
a
private
condemnee
in
one
respect;
it,
too,
has
the
power
of
condemnation.
with
respect
to
respondent's
claim
that
there
was
no
other
property
that
could
be
taken,
we
think
the
record
suggests
that
that
claim
be
judged
skeptically.
one
of
the
government's
comparable
sales
in
this
case
was
the
site
which
respondent
used
on
an
interim
basis
for
the
two
years
prior
to
the
acquisition
of
the
ellis
county
site.
that
site
not
only
could
have
been
condemned,
but
in
fact
did
trade
hands
in
the
private
market
during
the
two
year
period
that
respondent
was
using
it.
that's
one
of
the
comparable
sales.
comparable
sales
show
that
its
value
was
about
a
quarter
to...
a
quarter
of
that
rate
that
duncanville
paid
in
this
case.
finally...
and
these
are
only
illustrations
of
the
problems
that
crop
up
if
you
are
to
entertain
a
substitute
facilities
measure,
respondent
suggested
that
the
state
of
texas
required
the
removal
of
the
pipe,
gas
pipeline
in
this
case.
at
page
418
of
the
transcript,
mr.
nichols
reading
from
the
terms
of
the
permit,
the
permit,
said
no
waste
disposal
operation
shall
be
accomplished
within
30
feet
of
any
petroleum
products
pipeline
or
within
20
feet
of
its
corresponding
easement.
in
this
case,
that
meant
a
total
of
50
feet
on
either
side.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
assuming--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
had
a
global
objection
that
we
made
clear
from
the
very
start
that
this
theory
ought
not
be
entertained
at
all,
and
not
clear
why
we
had
to
object
specifically
as
to
how
you
ought
to
frame
the
instruction
that
we
said
ought
not
be
given.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
we
didn't
object
to
the--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--if
that
instruction
was
all
right,
but
we
contend
that
it
was
not.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
it
was
not
all
right.
so
we
think
that
this
case
is
not
likely
to
turn
on
this
point.
i
see
my
time
has
concluded.
