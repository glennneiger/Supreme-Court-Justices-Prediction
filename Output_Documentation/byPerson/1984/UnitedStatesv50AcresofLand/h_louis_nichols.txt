mr.
h.
louis
nichols
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
noted
on
your
docket
as
being
united
states
of
america
v.
50
acres
of
land,
et
al.,
and
i
represent
the
et
al.
i
represent
28,000
citizens
in
the
city
of
duncanville
whose
sanitary
landfill
was
taken
by
the
united
states
and
who
seek
to
receive
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
for
a
public
facility
which
was
taken
and
which
had
to
be
replaced
by
the
local
government.
the
question
is
what
is
just
compensation,
not
just
what
is
any
compensation,
but
what
is
just
compensation
where
a
local
facility
is
being
taken
by
the
federal
government
and
which
must
be
replaced
not
net
year
sometime,
but
has
to
be
replaced
tomorrow?
you
know,
you
pick
up
your
garbage;
you
have
got
to
put
it
down
someplace.
everybody
wants
you
to
pick
it
up,
but
nobody
wants
you
to
put
it
down
in
their
neighborhood.
so
it
isn't
a
matter
of
going
out
and
buying
you
another
piece
of
land
tomorrow
and
start
dumping
garbage
there.
you've
got
to
find
you
a
piece
of
land,
you've
got
to
find
it
in
an
area
where
you're
not
going
to
have
a
lot
of
neighborhood
opposition.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
your
honor,
they
gave
us
the
immediate
notice
and
says,
like
i
say,
normally
we'd
give
you
90
days,
but
we
want
it
immediately
because
we
don't
want
you
to
pollute
our
lake
anymore,
so
you
go
out
and
get
you
another
site.
and
they...
and
i
filed
a
motion
to
give
us
more
time,
and
we
were
able
to
work
out
a
month
or
two,
while
we
went
out
and
acquired
a
temporary
facility
that
was
owned
by
someone
else
that
we
could
use
temporarily.
if
you
use
the
federal
government's
position
that
only
market
value
is
the
proper
measure
of
damages.
they
would
not
even
pay
the
$110,000
that
we
had
to
spend
as
extra
expenses
temporarily
while
we
were
trying
to
find
another
facility.
so
they
wanted
it...
in
the
file
there's
a
letter
from
colonel
wall
that
says
normally
we
would
give
you
90
days,
but
we
want
to
get
this
site
immediately,
and
we
know
it
is
going
to
be
a
job
for
you
to
get
another
site,
but
you
go
out
and
set
it
anyhow,
so
we
did.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
oh,
we
had
only,
we
had
only
about
two
months,
less
than
90
days.
they
wanted
it
immediately.
i
got
a
little
time
by
going
into
court
and
filing
a
motion,
dragging
my
feet,
while
we
were
trying
to
find
another
location.
but
they
wanted
it
the
next
day.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
yes.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
well,
this
court
has
not
said
that,
your
honor.
this
court
has
not...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
has
said
that
fair
market
value
is
not
the
only
measure
of
compensation.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
the
starting
point
is
just
compensation,
that
what
is
just
compensation.
just
compensation
is
just
indemnification,
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
way
you
get
to
just
indemnification
is
by
the
adoption
of
certain
workable
rules,
and
that
we
have
applied
market
value
as
being
a
workable
rule
in
some
circumstances,
but
in
other
circumstances
it
may
not
be
a
proper
rule
to
be
followed
by
this
court.
so
i
think
we
have
to
find
out
what
teachings
do
we
receive
from
this
court
because
you
know
and
i
know
that
what
just
compensation
in
the
fifth
amendment
means
is
what
you
say
it
means.
i
mean,
this
is
the
bottom
line,
the
end
of
the
line;
what
you
say
is
just
compensation
is
just
compensation.
so
what
have
you
said
in
the
past
as
to
what
is
just
compensation?
first,
you've
said
that
we
have
not
determined
what
is
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
where
a
public
facilities
property
is
being
condemned.
you
noticed
that
in
the
lutheran
synod
case.
and
mr.
justice
white
noted
that
we
will
reserve
that
to
another
day.
well,
this
is
that
day.
this
is
the
day
for
you
to
decide
what
is
just
compensation
when
a
public
facility
has
been
taken
and
which
must
be
replaced,
what
is
just
indemnification
to
the
community
which
has
lost
a
public
facility
which
had
to
be
immediately
replaced
to
protect
the
public
health
of
the
community.
now,
that
is
really
what
we
are
here
to
decide
today.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
they
have
a
right
to
get
it
in
about
30
days,
but
the
problem
is
not
solved
by
that,
your
honor.
the
problem...
getting
the
land
is
just
the
beginning
of
it.
the
problem
is
solved
in
going
out
and
satisfying
the
state
that
this
is
a
suitable
site
for
which
you
can
receive
a
permit,
and
satisfying
the
state's
requirements
as
to
how
you
may
use
that
site.
there's
no
problem
buying
a
piece
of
land.
that's
no
problem.
you
know,
you
may
not
be
very
interested
in
landfill,
but
wait
until
you
try
to
locate
one
in
somebody's
neighborhood,
and
then
you
will
find
out
what
the
interest
is.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
or
a
prison,
sure.
so
in
this
instance,
certain
things
had
to
be
done.
we
went
out
first,
we
found
this
piece
of
land
that
we
could
buy,
and
we
found
a
piece
of
land
where
there
won't
be
a
lot
of
neighborhood
opposition.
that's
one
thing
you
don't
want,
a
lot
of
neighborhood
opposition.
we
found
a
piece
of
land
which
could
be
used,
and
it
was
within
a
reasonably
close
distance.
you
know,
you
don't
want
a
landfill
a
hundred
miles
away
where
the
garbage
trucks
have
got
to
go
a
hundred
miles
every
day.
so
you
try
to
find
one
as
close
to
the
city
as
you
can
get.
and
we
found
one
reasonably
close,
two
miles
further
away,
but
on
a
better
highway,
so
you
get
there
in
about
the
same
amount
of
time.
then
we
made
the
application
to
the
state
for
a
permit
on
this.
we
had
public
hearings
on
this.
everybody
had
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
they
then
take
about
120
days
to
decide
whether
we
are
going
to
give
you
a
permit
on
it.
then
they
give
you
a
permit
and
say,
well,
you
can
use
this
if
you
do
this,
this,
this
and
this,
one
of
which
was
to
remove
a
natural
gas
pipeline
that
ran
through
this
property
that
cost
os
$334,000
to
move.
that
was
removed
as
a
public
safety
measure.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
yes,
it
was
included.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
it
was,
it
was
included.
let
me
talk
about
what
happened
in
the
trial
court
for
a
moment
and
what
happened
in
the
court
of
appeals.
this
case
was
tried
in
the
trial
court
because
the
judge
would
not
decide
which
was
a
proper
measure,
since
you
had
not
decided
it.
and
the
court
said
we
will
try
it
both
ways,
so
we
tried
it
both
ways.
we
offered
this,
and
there
wasn't
any
question
but
what
we
could
sell
our
piece
of
land.
you
know,
landfill
sites
are
hard
to
come
by,
and
the
private
landfill
companies
would
like
to
buy
one
that
is
already
permit,
the
neighbors
are
already
happy
with
it,
you've
got
not
problem.
so
we
tried
it
both
ways.
we
put
on
the
evidence
of
what
we
could
get
for
our
land.
in
the
meanwhile,
we
had
already
bought,
permitted,
equipped
and
were
operating
the
new
landfill
site
at
that
time.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
the
permanent
one.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
we
had
spent
$1,276,000
for
that
site.
much
of
that
expense
would
have
been
attributable
and
charged
off
whether
we
were
buying
a
50
acre
site
or
a
113
acre
site.
the
moving
of
the
pipeline,
the
building
of
a
road
for
access
to
it,
satisfying,
getting
engineer
studies
made--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--i'm
saying
that
any
reasonable
expense
that
was
reasonably
necessary
to
provide
a
reasonably
adequate
substitute
facility.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
well,
the
circuit
court,
the
second
circuit,
and
the
california
court
has
held
that
where
you
have
a
public
condemnee,
it's
a
unique
situation
and
you
use
different
rules
to
determine,
to
determine
the
loss
sustained
by
the
community.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
two
reasons,
your
honor,
i
believe.
one,
or
first
is
they
acquire
and
hold
property,
use
property
for
an
entirely
different
purpose,
as
a
public
condemnee.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
well,
you
asked
me
why
i
think
there's
a
difference,
and
i
think--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--they
do--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--because
this
court
has
said
to
the
function
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
to
see
that
fairness
and
equity
are
the
result
of
the
condemnation
pay,
and
if--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--and
the
other
reason
that
goes
with
that
is
that
the
local
government
has
a
duty,
either
legally
or
factually,
to
replace
the
facility.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
private
individuals--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--it
bears
upon
the
fact
that
that
relates
to
the
loss
sustained
by
the
community
upon
the
condemnation
of
a
public
facility,
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
objective
to
be
reached
in
just
compensation
is
to
indemnify
for
loss
sustained.
now,
the
loss--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--he
may
not
get
back
in
business
at
all.
he
may
get
enough
money
to
live
off
the
interest
of
it.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
think
maybe,
but
in
this
instance,
and
the
whole
basis
for
this
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit
was
the
basis
that
the
city
was
obligated,
obligated
to
acquire
a
substitute
facility.
now,
that
was
a...
and
that
was
the
way
the
case
was
tried
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
because
it
relates
to
the
damage
sustained
by
the
city,
and
the
fifth
amendment
is
an
indemnification
provision,
and
if
they
have
to
replace
it,
they
are
entitled
to
be
indemnified
for
the
loss
sustained,
and
the
loss
to
a
public
entity
that
has
to
replace
a
facility
is
not
the
loss
of
the
50
acres,
but
the
loss
sustained
by
the
community
is
the
cost
of
acquiring
a
needed
substitute
facility.
that's
the
loss.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
that's
because
this
court
says
we
haven't
ruled
on
that
question
yet.
there
will
be
in
a
month
or
two,
i
guess.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
well,
let
me
say--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--well,
it
would
be,
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
cost
if
that
was
a
reasonable
and
necessary
expense
to
provide
a
reasonably
adequate
substitute
facility,
and
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
suppose
it
only
cost
$1000
and
the
land
was
worth
$200,000,
i
think
all
we
are
entitled
to
is
the
reasonable
cost
of
a
reasonably
adequate
substitute
facility,
whether
it
is
more
or
less
of
the
value
of
the
land
being
condemned,
because
that
is
the
loss
and
damage
sustained
by
the
public.
now,
this
case
was
tried
on
the
basis
that
the
jury
would
be
asked
to
determine
the
reasonable
cost
of
providing
a
reasonably
adequate
and
necessary
substitute
facility.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
will
read
the
record,
the
charge
to
the
jury
was
not
objected
to
by
the
government,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
was
tailored
to
meet
the
government's
position
that
the
cost
of
the
substitute
facility
would
include
the
words
"the
reasonable
cost",
which
the
court
put
in,
"of
a
reasonably
adequate
substitute
facility.
"
which
the
court
put
in,
and
that
was
what
the
jury
was
asked
to
decide.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
no,
sir.
we
both,
we
both
objected.
i
claimed
strongly
that
substitute
facilities
doctrine
was--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--based...
our
claims
held--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--and
they
said
ours
is
the
only
one,
except
that
i
tried
mine
much
stronger
both
ways
than
they
tried
theirs.
they
felt
rather
confident
on
the--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--yes,
i
did.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
i
have
tried
it
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
and--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--yes.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
twenty-eight
thousand,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
twenty-eight
thousand.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
there's
a
state
courthouse.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
or
you
buy
it,
if
that
is
the...
if
the
facts
support
that,
if
that's
the...
if
the
facts
support
it,
that
you
could
not
sell
it
or
that
that
was
an
unfair
method.
now,
what
this
court
has
said
in
previous
cases
is
that
when
market
value
has
been
too
difficult
to
find,
that
is
an
occasion
where
you
can
deviate
from
it,
or
when
its
application
would
result
in
manifest
injustice
to
the
owner
or
public,
and
in
that
instance
it
would
be
to
our
little
public
or
the
government's
big
public,
it
would
be
manifestly
unjust
to
the
little
public
or
the
big
public.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
i
make
that
is
because
the
undisputed
testimony
in
this
case
is
that
there
were
no
other
sites
available
for
a
sanitary
landfill.
the
undisputed
evidence
is
that
the
price
which
we
paid
was
the
price
that
we
had
to
pay
to
get
this
site,
and
they
got
the
113
acres
to
avoid
having
to
pay
severance
damages.
they
could
not
have
gotten
it
for
any
less,
they
could
not
have
gotten
another
site,
and
this
is
the
only
site
that
we
knew
of
that
would
have
been
permitted
by
the
state
to
use
as
a
landfill.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
well,
i
think
that
they...
that
when
you
read
the
fact
that
they
were
referring
to,
the
borough
of
manhattan
case
and
the
borough
of
brooklyn
case
and
the
red
bluff,
california
case,
they
were
taking
a
position
there,
i
believe,
that
whether
there
is
a
market
value
or
not,
that
if
the
facility
must
be
replaced,
that
the
cost
of
a
substitute
facility
is
a
proper
measure
of
damages
to
reimburse
the
loss
sustained
by
the
public
where
there
is
a
public
condemnee.
in
this
instance,
the
court
attempted
to
deal
with
that
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
submitted
to
the
court.
first,
the
court
let
in
evidence
showing
that
we
got
a
bigger
tract
of
land,
that
we
had
more
acres,
we
had
more
area
for
landfill,
and
they
had
an
itemized
expense
of
every
dollar
we
spent.
that
all
went
to
the
jury.
they
knew
we
spent
$1,276,000
where
we
had
a
landfill
that
would
last
longer
and
hold
more
garbage.
the
case
was
argued
to
the
jury
not...
we
did
not
argue
that
we
wanted
$1,276,000
from
the
jury.
we
argued
that
what
we
were
entitled
to
was
what
the
jury
found
to
be
the
reasonable
cost
of
a
reasonably
adequate
substitute
facility
which
we
had
to
acquire
to
protect
the
public
health
of
our
people.
they
knocked
of
$500,000
some
odd
for
what
we
had
spent
in
making
the
very
adjustments
that
the
fifth
circuit
says
should
be
made
in
order
to
be
sure
that
there's
not
a
windfall.
the
jury
made
those--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--i
did,
and
you
turned
it
down
so
fast
i
couldn't
hardly
catch
my
breath.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
yes,
simply
because
i
had
the
question
raised...
the
government
hadn't
objected
to
the
instructions.
the
trial
court
hadn't
ruled
on
them.
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
circuit
court,
but
the
circuit
court
remanded,
and
i
just
thought
it
wasn't
right.
i
just
thought
if
i
could
get
my
$723,000
up
here,
if
i
would
ask
you
to
give
it
to
me.
i
don't
think
i'm
going
to
get
it
now,
you
know.
i'd
like
to.
[laughter]
it's
like
we'd
all
like
to
be
rich
and
good
looking,
but
i
don't
think
i'm
going
to
be
any
more
of
that
today
than
i'm
going
to
get
that
judgment.
but
anyhow,
the
point
is,
the
point
is
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
to
indemnify
a
local
community
for
its
loss,
then
you
determine
what
the
loss
is,
and
then...
that's
what
the
jury
tried
to
decide
there,
and
they
made
every
adjustment
that
the
circuit
court
talked
about.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
this
court
has
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
just
compensation
clause
is
indemnification.
that's
what
you
all
said,
and
i
believe
it's
true.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
as
i
recall,
this
court
has
said
that
they
haven't
said
that
yet,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
are
lower
courts
that
construe
that
language
in
the
fifth
amendment
to
apply
to
public
property
being
taken
by
a
paramount
public
authority.
and
they
have...
no
one
has
really
challenged
that
that
i
know
of.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
i
have
not
found
a
case
where
you
said
that.
i
have
not
found
a
case...
but
i
have
never
found
a
case
where
that
question
was
really
seriously
raised
by
anybody.
now,
what
you
do
find,
what
you
do
find
in
your
cases
in
brief
is
that
the
united
states
government
takes
the
position
and
they
argue
that.
they
don't
argue
market
value
in
this
situation.
they
take
the
position
that
if
you
don't
have
to
replace
that
public
facility,
then
we
don't
have
to
pay
you
anything,
or
we
pay
you
nominal
value.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
well,
they
have
taken
that
position
in
cases
cited
in
the
brief
and
cases
cited
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
they
say,
they
say
that
in
some
cases,
if
you
do
no
have
to
replace
it,
you
have
been
relieved
of
the
cost
of
the
maintenance
of
the
facility--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--well,
that's
what
he's
arguing
today,
your
honor,
but
there
are
other
cases
where
the
united
states
government
is
a
party
where
they
have
argued
and
urged
and
received
a
finding
that
they
will
receive
only
nominal
value.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
certainly
it
isn't.
they
could
be--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--the
consistency
of
the
government's
position
in
this
case
has
been
their
inconsistency
because
in
one
case
they
were
arguing
market
value
only,
only
market
value.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
i
don't
believe
i
can
tell
you
that.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
they
give
the
quick,
prescribed
procedure
for
acquiring
possession--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--no,
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
no,
it
does
not.
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--no,
sir.
you
know,
i've
heard
this...
i've
been
sitting
here
two
days
now.
you
all
have
argued
statutes,
you've
argued
what
congress
intended.
what
now
we
are
talking
about
is
only
what
does
the
just
compensation
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
mean
where
a
public
facility
has
been
acquired
by
the
federal
government
and
where
the
local
entity
had
to
replace
that
public
facility
in
order
to
protect
the
health
of
the
community.
now,
that
is
what...
it
is
so
simple
that
you
don't
have
to
go
back
and
find
out
what
congress
intended
or
how
many
other
laws
there
are.
what
does
the
constitution
mean
when
it's
days
you
are
entitled
to
just
compensation?
in
this
case,
the
federal
government
says
that
since
there
is
a
market
value,
that
market
value
is
just
the
compensation
we
are
entitled
to,
just
the
compensation,
not
that
it
is
just
compensation,
but
just
the
compensation
we
are
entitled
to.
and
the
question
here
is
what
is
just,
just
indemnity
to
a
local
community
who
through
no
fault
of
its
own
lost
a
facility
they
had
to
go
out
and
replace
the
next
day?
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
i
would
say
that
i
could
not
be
damaged,
and
that--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--i
don't
know
whether
you
could
or
not.
now,
you
just
added
some
little
something
to
it
that
you
had
not--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--if
i
had
a
piece
of
land--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--what
that
piece
of
property
would
sell
for
today
permitted
as
a
landfill
and
with
so
many
acres
of
it
filled
and
so
many
acres
of
it
unfilled.
that's
what--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--it
could
probably
in
that
area...
and
this
is
what
is
customary...
could
probably
be
used
for
open
space,
park
area,
grow
trees,
because
you
can't
build
over
the
landfill,
and
for
years
you've
got
methane
gas
coming
out
of
it.
so
it's
really
not
usable
for
any
commercial
activity.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
well--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--as
a
landfill.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
well,
it
could
be
sold
as
a
landfill,
no
question
about
it,
not
a
word,
but
you
asked
what
it
would
be
worth
after
that.
the
value,
in
my
opinion,
in
that
location,
based
upon
the
evidence,
and
i'm
only
giving
my
opinion--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--i
heard
that
argument
earlier.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
oh,
i
think
it
may
have
some
value.
but
i
don't
know
that
we've
been
damaged.
and
that's
not
a
situation
where
we
were
replacing
a
required
public
facility
with
one
that
was
similar.
now,
if
we
had
six
months
left...
let's
just
take
it
one
little...
if
we
had
only
six
months
left
of
that
facility
when
it
was
taken
over
by
the
government,
we
would
only
be
entitled
to
what
it
would
cost
to
acquire
a
facility
that
was
good
for
six
months.
now,
how
much
you
had
to
pay
for
it
is
not
just
going
out
and
buying
one
acre,
you
fill
up
one
acre
in
six
months,
but
how
much
do
you
have
to
spend
to
make
it
a
permitted,
public
facility?
we
say
in
this
instance
that
market
value
is
not
the
proper
measure
of
damages;
market
value
wouldn't
even
reimburse
us
for
the
$110,000
we
spent
for
temporary
use.
we
say
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
just
compensation
clause
is
to
compensate
or
indemnify
the
public
for
its
loss,
then
we
are
entitled
to
whatever
it
cost,
reasonably,
to
provide
a
reasonable
facility.
that's
the
instructions
that
were
given
to
the
jury
at
my
request
and
at
the
government's
request.
i
think
that
if
you
will
read
the
opinion
in
the
united
states
v.
borough
of
manhattan
cited
in
the
brief,
you
will
find
a
rule
of
law
that
i
would
say
is
the
proper
rule
of
law
and
one
to
be
considered
and
adopted
by
this
court,
since
you
have
not
ruled
on
it
in
the
past,
and
it
is
this:
one,
the
substitute
facility
doctrine
has
been
developed
to
meet
the
unique
needs
of
public
condemnees.
in
addition
to
citing
numerous
cases,
this
court
also
cites
cases
where
school
grounds,
playgrounds,
parking
lots
in
other
jurisdictions,
the
second
circuit
particularly,
have
approved
the
substitute
facility
as
the
measure
of
damages
there,
even
if
there
was
a
market
value
of
the
property
being
condemned.
simply
stated,
this
rule
assures
that
sufficient
damages
will
be
awarded
to
finance
the
replacement
of
the
condemned
facility.
the
substitute
facility...
and
this
is
your
language...
is
not
an
exception
carved
out
of
the
market
value
test,
it
is
an
alternative
method
available
in
public
condemnation
proceedings,
alternative
method
available
in
public
condemnation
proceedings,
citing
other
cases
from
the
second
and
ninth
court.
where
circumstances
warrant,
it
is
another
arrow
in
the
trier's
bow
when
confronted
with
the
issue
of
just
compensation.
when
public
condemnee
proves
that
there
is
a
duty
to
replace
a
condemned
facility,
it
is
entitled
to
the
cost
of
constructing
a
functionally
equivalent
substitute,
the
cost
of
constructing
a
functionally
equivalent
substitute,
whether
the
cost
be
more
or
less
than
the
market
value
of
the
facility
taken,
more
or
less.
it
works
both
ways,
cuts
both
ways.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
that
if
the
structure...
sir?
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
then
that's
all
we're
entitled
to,
a
replacement,
a
reasonably
adequate
substitute
facility.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
you
can't,
you
see,
you
can't
build
a
new
bridge
or
a
new
highway
for
that
much...
for
what
it
cost
to
build
it
originally,
but
no
one
contends
that
you
only
get
a
90
percent
depreciate
the
bridge
when
you
are
going
to
replace
the
bridge.
they
give
you
a
new
bridge,
and
that's
no
problem.
and
we're
not
even
asking
for
that.
all
we
are
asking
for
is
replacement
of
the
facility.
and
finally--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--i
think
if
there
is
no
duty
to
replace--
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
--i
think
that
the
court
has
not
ruled
on
that,
and
the
circuits
hold
both
ways.
mr.
h.
louis
nichols
what
i
think?
i
think
that
it
should
be
zero
because
the
duty
is
to
indemnify
the
loss.
if
there
has
been
no
loss,
there
is
no
indemnification
called
for.
finally,
i
say
that
if
a
structure
is
reasonably
necessary
for
the
public
welfare,
compensation
is
measured
not
in
terms
of
value
but
by
the
loss
to
the
community
occasioned
by
the
condemnation.
thank
you
very
much.
