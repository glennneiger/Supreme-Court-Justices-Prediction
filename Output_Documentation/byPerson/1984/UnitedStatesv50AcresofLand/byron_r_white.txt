justice
white
at
least
there
haven't
been
any
sales.
justice
white
well,
how
did
the
jury
come
in
with
$750,000?
justice
white
well,
wouldn't
the
court
of
appeals
adjustments
take
care
of
that?
justice
white
well,
wasn't
it
aimed
at
that?
justice
white
if
the
substitute
facility
is
obviously
twice
as
big,
or
lasts
twice
as
long,
i
would
suppose
the
adjustments
would
take
care
of
that.
justice
white
but
it
did
vacate
the--
justice
white
--didn't
you
have
a
chance
to
put
on
your
evidence?
i
gather
you
did;
you
put
on
your
evidence
as
to
what
this
substitute
facility
was
worth.
justice
white
you
said
you
were
the
only
evidence
about
that.
justice
white
well,
you
did...
you
did
it
as
well
as
you
could,
and
the
jury
just
didn't
believe
you.
justice
white
or
they
didn't
accept
your
story,
anyway.
justice
white
well,
you
had
your
chance,
though.
justice
white
well,
then,
i
guess
you
are
stuck
with
it
if
we
think
the
substitute
facility
view
is
all
right;
you
are
stuck
with
the
court
of
appeals
deductions
from
this
$750,000,
i
take
it.
justice
white
on
remand,
on
remand
are
they
going
to
redetermine
the
value
of
the
substitute
facility
or
just
determine
some
deductions?
justice
white
why
would
they
set
aside
the
750,000
valuation
as
a
base
from
which
to
make
some
deductions?
justice
white
it
really
would
be
hard
to
sell
o'hare
airport,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
well,
usually
people
like
to
get
back
in
business.
justice
white
--well,
the
government,
did
the
government
agree
from
the
very
outset
that
it
would
go
to
the
jury
on
this
bifurcated
instruction?
justice
white
was
the
only
one.
justice
white
and
the
government
said
the--
justice
white
why
didn't
you
cross-petition
up
here?
justice
white
that's
right,
you
did,
and
you
wanted
us
to
set
aside
the
remand.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
mean
they
wouldn't
pay
you
market
value
for
what
you
could
sell
this
land
for?
justice
white
i
thought
your
opposition
here
stood
up
and
said
it
is
always
market
value,
whether
it
is
going
to
cost
you
that
much
or
not.
justice
white
that
may
be.
that
isn't
their
submission
here,
though.
justice
white
all
right,
it
isn't.
justice
white
by
the
way,
what
statute
did
the
united
states
proceed
under
here?
justice
white
does
the
statute
they
proceeded
under,
do
they
give
the
procedure
as
to
how
compensation
is
to
be
determined?
justice
white
does
that
happen
to
use
any
words
about
what
the
measure
of
damages
is?
justice
white
the
statute
doesn't
say
a
word
about
that.
justice
white
you
mean
they
can't
turn
this
into
a
statutory
case.
justice
white
what
would
be
your
position
if
the
government
gave
you
notice
and
you,
just
about
six
months
before
you
were
going
to
fill
up
that
landfill?
within
six
months
you
are
going
to
have
to
go
out
and
replace
it
for
this
$1,200,000,
and
the
government
gives
you
notice
and
says
six
months
from
now
we
want
that
property,
just
at
the
very
time
where
it
will
be
of
absolutely
no
use
to
you
whatsoever
for
a
landfill,
and
you
will
have
to
go
get
another
one.
so
you
would
say
that
they
could
have
your
property
for
nothing?
justice
white
well,
you
have
a
piece
of
property
there
that
now
you
can
build
buildings
on
it,
and--
justice
white
--no,
the
landfill
was--
justice
white
--what
was
the,
what
was
the
testimony
at
the
trial?
how
did
they
have
market
value?
how
did
they
arrive
at
market
value,
what
that
piece
of
property
could
be
sold
for?
justice
white
and
what
was
the
use
of
the
land
that
was
filled?
justice
white
but
you
could
sell
it
for
something
apparently.
justice
white
the
testimony
was
you
could
sell
this
property
including--
justice
white
--including
the
piece
that
was
filled.
justice
white
would
be
zero?
justice
white
would
be
zero,
would
be
zero.
on
my
facts,
the
value
would
be
zero,
is
that
it?
justice
white
you
would
apply
that
rule--
justice
white
what
do
you
think
the
rule
is
that
there
is
no
duty
to
replace?
then
it
is
market
value,
isn't
it?
justice
white
or
is
it
zero?
justice
white
how
about
your--
