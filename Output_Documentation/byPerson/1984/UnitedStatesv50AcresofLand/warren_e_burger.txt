chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
50
acres
of
land.
mr.
schwartz.
chief
justice
burger
let
me
go
back,
counsel.
isn't
the
basic
rule
fair
market
value
unless
it
is
not
ascertainable?
chief
justice
burger
i
suppose
if
the
federal
government
was
taking
a
local
airport,
you
might
have
difficulty
finding
a
fair
market
value
of
the
airport
as
such
unless
it
was
adaptable
for
development,
real
estate
development.
would
that
be
the
type
of
case
where
they
might
turn
to
some
other
standard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
nichols?
chief
justice
burger
you
referred,
mr.
nichols,
to
the
language
of
the
constitution--
chief
justice
burger
--which
is
the
starting
point,
but
hasn't
that
language
been
embellished
by
construction
to
place
on
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
fair
market
value
as
the
primary--
chief
justice
burger
--not
the
only,
no,
but
isn't
that
the
starting
point
through
the
law
generally?
i
am
not
speaking
of
our
court
here.
chief
justice
burger
let
me
pose
this
question
to
you.
chief
justice
burger
i
don't
know
how
big
duncanville
is
but
i
suppose--
chief
justice
burger
you
have
got
a
local
courthouse,
state
courthouse.
chief
justice
burger
now,
if
the
united
states
came
along
and
said
we
want
to
build
a
federal
building
there,
everybody
would
like
to
have
the
federal
building,
but
in
determining
value,
it
is
pretty
hard
to
find
a
market
for
your
courthouse
because
not
many
people
want
to
buy
a
courthouse
as
such,
and
i
thought
it
was
understood
that
these
alternative
methods
were
to
meet
that
kind
of
a
situation
where
you
can't
really
find
the
fair
market
value
of
a
local
county
courthouse
of
28,000,
a
city
of
28,000
people.
so
there
you
might
get
something
other
than...
you'd
have
to
have
another
value,
so
you
might
go
to
reproduction
cost
or
something
like
it.
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
are
treating
indemnification
and
compensation
as
being,
having
the
same
content,
meaning
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
burger
--you
would
apply
that
rule
to
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
about
taking
your
local
courthouse,
that
if
you
could
build
another
or
for
less,
then
you'd--
chief
justice
burger
--but
if
you
built
it
40
years
ago,
you
probably
couldn't
build
it
for
that
much
money
today.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
schwartz?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
