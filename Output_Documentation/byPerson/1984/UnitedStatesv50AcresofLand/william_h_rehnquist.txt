justice
rehnquist
mr.
schwartz,
you
say
that
in
the
case
of
sewers
and
water
lines,
fair
market
value
simply
doesn't
exist.
are
you
saying
that
a
finder
of
fact,
properly
instructed
with
valuation
instructions
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
in
hearing
testimony,
couldn't
place
a
value
on,
say,
a
sewer
line?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
know,
in
cases
where
there
are
no
comparable
sales,
you
can
go
to
sometimes
to
reproduction
cost.
why
can't
you
do
that
in
the
case
of
a
sewer
line?
justice
rehnquist
but
why
not
say
that
is
one
form
of
fair
market
value
rather
than
saying
where
fair
market
value
can't
be
ascertained
you
resort
to
substitute
facilities.
well,
it
isn't
market
value,
is
it?
i
mean,
it's
fair
value,
but
it
isn't
market
value.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
nichols,
how
much
time
elapsed
in
this
case
between
the
first
notice
you
had
of
the
condemnation
and
the
actual
taking
by
the
government,
the
dispossessing?
justice
rehnquist
what,
did
you
have
less
than
90
days
or
more
than
90
days?
justice
rehnquist
the
temporary
one
or
the--
justice
rehnquist
--the
permanent
one.
justice
rehnquist
you
are
saying
in
effect,
mr.
nichols,
that
anything,
any
damage
that
was
really
proximately
caused
to
you
by
the
condemnation
ought
to
be
picked
up
by
the
government.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
you
are
going
against
a
large
body
of
condemnation
law
there
because
traditionally,
for
instance,
the
owner
of
a
small
business
whose
site
is
condemned
gets
the
fair
market
value
of
the
site,
but
he
gets
nothing
for
good
will,
nothing
for
moving
expenses.
congress
enacted
a
bill
a
few
years
ago
that
said
over
and
above
just
compensation,
we
will
pay
you
for
these
sort
of
items,
but
that
has
never
been
thought
to
be
part
of
just
compensation.
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
should
that,
why
should
a
public
condemnee
such
as
your
client
be
any
different
from
a
small
businessman
who
suffers
incompensible
causal
damage
as
a
result
of
a
condemnation?
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
what?
so
what?
justice
rehnquist
you
say
it's
a
different
purpose--
justice
rehnquist
--why
should
the
different
purpose
make
any
difference?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
can
make
that
argument
just
as
well
in
the
case
of
your
small
businessman
as
you
can
in
the
case
of
your
local
government.
justice
rehnquist
why
has
that
got
anything--
justice
rehnquist
--no,
why
has
that
got
anything
to
do
with
it?
i
know
you
are
stating
that,
but
why
does
that
bear
on
the
question?
justice
rehnquist
the
small,
the
small
businessman
is
either
going
to
have
to
get
back
in
business
or
starve.
justice
rehnquist
but
now,
i
still
don't
understand
from
your
submission,
you
have
repeated
the
phrase
several
times,
that
the
city
was
obligated
to
do
this.
justice
rehnquist
why
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
rehnquist
but
what...
no
case
from
this
court
supports
that
proposition,
does
it?
justice
rehnquist
suppose
the
only
place
you
could
get
would
require
a
road
that
cost
$80
million
to
get
to
the
place?
would
that
be
the
cost?
