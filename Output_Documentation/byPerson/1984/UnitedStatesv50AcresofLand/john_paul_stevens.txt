justice
stevens
mr.
nichols,
can
i
ask
you
a
perhaps
a
question
which
will
display
my
ignorance
to
you,
but
the
fifth
amendment
talks
about
the
taking
of
private
property
for
public
use
without
just
compensation.
i
know
there
are
some
lower
court
cases,
but
has
this
court
ever
said
that
the
taking
of
public
property
shall
be
paid
for
by
just
compensation?
justice
stevens
i
understand
the
government
doesn't
challenge
it,
but
i
just...
is
it...
we
have
never,
or
have
we
ever
said
that
the
right
standard
is
just
compensation?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
follow
up
on
that?
i
know
it
was
addressed
in
note
9,
but
is
it...
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
although
the
court
has
held
that
there
is
the
power
to
condemn,
there
has
been
no
holding
on
what
the
measure
of
compensation
is?
justice
stevens
that's
what
i
understood
note
9
to
say.
