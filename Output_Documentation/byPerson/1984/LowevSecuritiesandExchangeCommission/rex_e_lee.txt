mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
key
to
decision
in
this
case
is
the
perspective
from
which
it
is
approached.
the
petitioners
would
view
it
as
a
single
dimensional
case
involving
exclusively
first
amendment
issues.
it's
a
perspective
that
would
bring
into
play
our
historical
aversion
to
prior
restraints
and
a
perspective
which
would
draw
no
distinction
between,
on
the
one
hand,
the
right
of
any
person
to
publish
to
the
world
at
large
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
right
of
a
fiduciary
to
publish
for
the
benefit
of
the
very
group
to
whom
he
or
she
owes
the
fiduciary
obligation.
but
it
is
a
quite
different
case
if
it's
considered
for
what
it
really
is,
and
that
is
a
professional
discipline
case,
because
prior
restraints
of
the
clearest
kind
have
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
cases
like
barsky
versus
the
board
of
regents
and
ohralik
versus
the
ohio
state
bar
association
in
order
to
assure
that
unworthy
persons
not
serve
in
certain
fiduciary
capacities.
in
this
case
the
person
affected
is
a
five-time
convicted
criminal
whose
offenses
have
included
stealing
a
client's
funds
and
then
falsifying
the
evidence
in
an
attempt
to
convince
the
court
that
he
had
made
restitution
when
in
fact
he
had
not,
and
that
particular
offense
was
a
felony.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
from
our
standpoint
it
would,
because
he's
unregistered
and
the
statute
requires
registration.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
except
that...
except
in
this
sense,
justice
stevens.
absent
the
criminal
conduct,
registration
as
a
practical
matter
is
virtually
automatic
following
the
45-day
period.
you
can
look
at
the
documents
that
surround
the
application
and
in
the
event
there
is
no
problem
then
registration
becomes
automatic.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
never
apply.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
never
apply.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
the
starting
point
for
analysis,
i
submit,
is
that
the
petitioners
have
effectively
conceded
that
this
is
a
professional
discipline
case,
because
the
remedy
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me?
being
viewed
as
a
professional
discipline
case?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
it
does,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
but
in
effect,
justice
blackmun,
we're
over
that
hurdle,
because
both
sides
are
treating
it
as
a
professional
discipline
case,
the
remedy
for
which
mr.
schoeman
is
contending
is
one
that
involves
an
oral...
excuse
me...
a
prior
restraint
of
the
clearest
kind,
because
he
agrees
that
because
of
the
crimes
committed
by
mr.
lowe
he
can
be
enjoined
from
giving
in
person
investment
advice.
so
that
the
only
real
question
in
this
case--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
so
that
the
only
real
question
is
one
of
line-drawing.
now,
the
petitioners
for
their
part
contend
that
the
line
to
be
drawn
between
those
whose
speech
is
to
be
previously
restrained
and
those
whose
speech
is
not
to
be
previously
restrained
is
a
line
between
advice
delivered
on
an
individualized
basis
for
compensation
and
published
advice
for
compensation.
the
line
marked
out
by
congress
is
different.
congress
extended
the
registration
requirement
to
all
investment
advisers,
including
those
who
publish,
but
it
excluded
publishers
of
bona
fide
newspapers,
magazines,
or
other
financial
or
business
publications
of
general
and
regular
circulation.
and
our
case
comes
down
to
this:
since
prior
restraints
are
a
constituent
element
of
everybody's
test
and
since
therefore
the
only
question
is
where
the
line
is
to
be
drawn,
we
submit
that
congress,
for
whom
the
fashioning
of
dividing
lines
lies
at
the
very
core
of
its
constitutional
stewardship,
was
entitled
to
mark
out
its
own
boundary
and
was
not
constitutionally
required
to
pick
the
one
preferred
by
petitioners.
and
that
proposition
is
strengthened
when
we
examine
the
line
that
congress...
the
decision
that
congress
made
against
the
background
of
the
problem
that
it
faced.
as
this
court
stated
in
sec
versus
capital
gains,
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940
was
the
last
in
a
series
of
acts
designed
to
eliminate
certain
abuses
in
the
securities
industry
which
were
found
to
have
contributed
to
the
stock
market
crash
of
1929
and
the
depression
of
the
1930's.
that
statement
was
made
in
the
context
of
a
case
involving
the
precise
form
of
investment
advice
that
is
involved
here,
namely
an
investment
advisory
letter.
the
series
of
six
statutes
extending
from
1933
to
1940
dealt
with
many
phases
of
the
securities
industry,
and
concern
over
the
practices
of
investment
advisers
surfaced
early
in
the
process.
in
1934
a
senate
report
revealed
widespread
abuses
by
publishers
of
financial
publications
and,
contrary
to
petitioners'
assertion,
these
included
practices
of
publishers
of
investment
advisory
services
and
those
are
set
forth
in
footnotes
11
and
13
of
our
brief
and
in
footnote
15
of
this
court's
capital
gains
opinion.
but
even
so,
congress
did
not
act
immediately.
the
1940
act
was
passed
only
after
another
report,
undertaken
pursuant
to
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
of
1935,
confirmed
the
presence
of
the
problem
in
the
investment
advisory
profession.
plainly,
we
ought
not
criticize
congress
for
proceeding
slowly
and
carefully
one
step
at
a
time.
but
ultimately,
it
concluded
that
national
regulation
of
investment
advisory
publishers
was
necessary
because
of
two
types
of
injury
that
it
found
to
have
been
caused
by
unscrupulous
publishers
in
the
absence
of
regulation.
the
first
was
harm
to
investors
generally
trading
in
the
market;
and
the
second
was
direct
harm
to
the
individual
subscribers
caused
by
the
investment
advice
that
they
received.
even
so,
the
actual
regulatory
scheme
selected
by
congress
was
a
fairly
modest
one.
at
the
core
of
what
it
did
was
its
determination
that
investment
advisers
are
fiduciaries,
and
this
also
lies
at
the
core
of
our
case;
that
they
occupy,
as
this
court
stated
in
capital
gains,
"a
relationship
of
trust
and
confidence
with
their
clients."
and
necessarily,
given
the
language
of
the
investment
advisers
act,
"their
clients"
means
those
who
subscribe
to
published
investment
advisory
letters.
congress
did
not
impose
either
financial
or
educational
qualifications
on
investment
advisers,
as
it
had,
for
example,
in
the
case
of
broker-dealers.
rather,
it
required
only
that
they
file,
that
they
register,
and
it
made
the
continuing
entitlement
to
registration
conditioned
on
the
applicant
not
having
engaged
in
certain
specified
misconduct
relevant
to
that
special
fiduciary
relationship.
in
short,
the
central
thrust
of
the
statute
was
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
fiduciary
channel,
the
channel
of
communication
between
the
adviser
and
those
who
had
specifically
sought
out
and
paid
for
his
advice,
by
preventing
criminals
and
other
wrongdoers
from
having
access
to
those
channels.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
draw
the
line
at
this
point,
justice
rehnquist.
my
general
principle,
the
governing
principle,
is
that
disbarred
persons
or
otherwise
unqualified
persons
may
not
have
access
to
the
special
fiduciary
channels.
now
let's
take
the
disbarred
lawyer,
and
i'll
refer
to
your
example,
your
present
example,
and
also
the
one
that
you
posed
to
mr.
schoeman.
here
i
think
is
the
case
in
which
the
state
can
regulate.
during
the
time
that
i
was
in
practice
in
arizona,
i
represented
a
number
of
trade
association
clients
and
also
other
groupings
of
clients.
because
of
those
representations,
from
time
to
time
when
there
would
be
general
developments,
either
opinions
of
this
court,
as
for
example
in
the
agricultural
labor
context,
i
would
send
out
letters
to
all
of
my
clients
telling
them
of
general
developments
in
the
law.
now,
the
reason
that
i
did
that
was
because
of
a
previously
established
fiduciary
relationship
between
me
and
them.
there
is
little
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
day
that
i
was
disbarred
from
practice
is
the
day
that
i
could
no
longer
do
that
because
of
this
previously
established
fiduciary
relationship.
now,
the
harder
case
is
the
one
that
you
posed
to
mr.
schoeman,
where
i
simply
pick
people
out
of
the
phone
took
without
this
previously
established
fiduciary
channel.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
would
not,
and
here
is
the
reason.
the
analogy
between
lawyers
and
investment
advisers
carries
you
to
a
certain
point,
but
does
not
solve
all
the
problems.
the
crucial,
ultimate
inquiry
is,
does
a
fiduciary
relationship
exist
or
not?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
it
is
not,
and
here
is
the
reason.
the
fiduciary
relationship
exists
with
respect
to
investment
advisers
because
of
congress'
express
determination,
made
in
the
context
of
a
publication
that
went
out,
of
an
investment
advisory
letter
that
went
out
to
thousands
of
people,
that
there
was
a
fiduciary
relationship
between
the
publisher
of
an
investment
advisory
letter
and
those
who
sought
out
and
paid
for
that
particular
advice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
one
difference
between
securities
brokers
and
lawyers
in
my
view.
the
state,
if
it
made
such
a
determination,
i
think
it
would
lie
within
the
authority
of
a
state
legislature
to
determine
that
there
is
a
sufficient
fiduciary
relationship
between
a
disbarred
lawyer
who
is
giving
legal
advice
of
the
kind
that
you
talk
about
and
these
general
types.
this
is
a
situation
in
between,
of
course,
where
he
simply
publishes
a
book
or
is
a
syndicated
columnist.
but
where
he
publishes
to
subscribers,
i
think
that
that
would
lie
within
the
prerogative
of
the
state.
but
there
is
also...
this
case
is
also
distinguishable
in
this
sense,
and
this
relates
to
the
difference
between
the
way
that
lawyers
do
their
work
and
the
way
that
investment
advisers
do
their
work.
in
the
case
of
investment
advisers,
they
are
capable
of
prescribing,
if
you
will,
or
giving
their
advice
on
which
people
will
rely
all
at
once
and
doing
so
with
a
greater
effect.
that
is,
typically
for
the
lawyer
the
advice
is
one
on
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
absolutely
not,
justice
marshall.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
difference
is
this--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--clearly
he
could,
clearly
he
could.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
that
he
could.
the
difference
is
this:
the
persons
who
purchase
that
newspaper
are
purchasing
a
collection,
are
purchasing
it
for
a
collection
of
reasons.
in
that
newspaper
is
advice
on
food,
on
travel,
on
who
should
be
number
one
in
the
football
polls,
and
also
perhaps
is
an
article
by
a
lawyer.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
it
is
only
legal
news,
that
becomes
a
much
harder
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
statute
i
think
would
be
unconstitutional.
the
hardest,
the
hardest
is
the
other
hypothetical
that
you
just
asked,
where
the
legislature...
and
this
gets
very
close
to
justice
rehnquist's
hypothetical...
where
the
legislature
passes
a
law
saying
that
it
is
a
violation
of
what
we
perceive
to
be
a
fiduciary
relationship
between
disbarred
lawyers
and
anyone
within
the
state
with
regard
to
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
regardless
of
whether
you
call
it
a
fiduciary
relationship,
position,
or
a
relationship
of
special
trust
and
confidence,
i
think
the
hardest
case
is
whether
the
legislature
could
say
that
a
disbarred
lawyer
may
not
publish
a...
may
not
publish
a
newsletter
that
deals
exclusively
with
legal
advice,
which
will
be
subscribed
to
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
legal
advice.
that
is
a
harder
case
than
is
the
case
where
he
just
publishes
one
column
which
is
a
part
of
a
column
in
a
newspaper.
and
it
is
a
much
harder
case
than
is
this
case,
and
the
reason
is
that
congress,
as
a
result
of
what
can
only
fairly
be
described
as
the
greatest
financial
calamity
that
our
nation
has
ever
undergone,
concluded
that
a
contributing
cause
to
that
was
the
practices
of
unscrupulous
persons
acting
as
investment
advisers.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
for
the
same
reason,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
public
interest
is
not
fully
served
by
requiring
that
i
as
a
disbarred
lawyer,
before
i
exercise
speech
in
the
way
that
i'm
exercising
it
right
now,
in
representing
a
client,
in
doing
legal
work,
disclose
to
that
client
and
to
the
public
at
large
that
i'm
a
crook.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
but
the
point
is
that
they
become
clients
when
they
do
subscribe.
they
are
not
clients
simply
when
they
purchase
it
as
a
part
of
a
newspaper.
they
are
asking
mr.
lowe
for
his
specific
advice
as
to
how
they
should
invest
their
money.
and
the
point,
the
crucial
point
to
decision
in
this
case,
is
that
that
is
the
fiduciary
relationship
that
congress
identified.
now,
to
come
more
directly
to
your
question,
that's
always
a
question
of
how
far
you
need
to
go,
is
disclosure
sufficient
or
is
a
more
effective
remedy
needed
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
certainly
not
in
the
professional
discipline
context.
take
the
capital
gains
research
case
itself.
if
the
petitioners
were
correct,
then
the
result
in
the
capital
gains
case
would
have
had
to
have
been
different,
and
the
reason
is
as
follows.
the
position
for
which
the
petitioners
contend
is
summarized
in
their
reply
brief:
"the
power
to
license
professionals"--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
but
he
would
also...
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
his
mouth,
but
i
do--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
there
are
many
things
with
which
mr.
schoeman
and
i
disagree
in
this
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
i
am
simply
saying
that
the
thrust
of
the
position
that
is
taken
in
the
reply
brief,
that
the
power
of
government
to
regulate
professionals
is
limited
to
the
face
to
face
in
person
context,
simply
will
not
wash,
because
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
capital
gains,
this
court
did
uphold
it.
now,
i'll
grant
you
that
the
court
did
not
pass
in
the
precise
first
amendment
issue
in
that
case
because
they
didn't
have
to.
but
the
point
is
that
the
result
would
have
been...
the
result
would
have
had
to
have
been
otherwise.
and
in
ohralik,
ohralik
was
clearly
prohibited,
not
just
required
to
disclose,
but
was
clearly
prohibited
from
engaging
in
speech.
dr.
barsky,
if
you
will,
when
he
was
disqualified
from
practicing
medicine
for
six
months
was
disqualified
from
engaging
in
speech.
in
short,
once
you
get
over
the
threshold
that
this
case
is
a
prior
restraint
case
because
it
involves
professional
discipline,
then
we
submit
that
congress
was
constitutionally
entitled
to
draw
the
line
at
the
place
that
congress
in
fact
drew
it.
many
of
the
arguments
that
are
advanced
by
the
petitioners
and
their
amici
are
addressed
to
cases
other
than
this
one.
they
are
arguments
that
are
designed
to
make
this
case
more
difficult
than
it
is.
there
is
a
rather
clean
dividing
line.
fortunately,
it
is
a
line
that
has
been
marked
out
by
congress.
it
is
that
government
is
entitled
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
channels
of
communication
between
the
fiduciary
and
those
persons
whom
the
fiduciary
serves;
and
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
communication
occurring
within
that
channel,
then
congress
can
control
it.
now,
there
are
differences
in
that
respect
between
the
kinds
of
fiduciary
relationships
between
a
lawyer
and
his
client
and
between
an
investment
adviser
and
his
clients,
but
the
again
the
significance
of
the
capital
gains
case
is
its
determination,
is
its
approval
of
congress'
determination,
that
that
was
and
is
a
fiduciary
relationship.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
could.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
justice
stevens,
that
is
right
at
the
very
edge
of--
[laughter]
--of
what
is
permissible
and
what
is
not
permissible.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
it
does
not
have
the
same
fiduciary
relationship,
because
there
is
nothing
to
establish
a
fiduciary
relationship
between
law
students
or
even
lawyers
and
a
person
who
has
never
sought
cut
that
person's
advice.
that's
the
way
a
fiduciary
relationship
comes
into
existence
in
our
profession.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
you
had...
i
think
it
would
depend
on
two
things.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
you
do
have
in
this
instance
perhaps
the
most
careful
and
extensive
determination
that
congress
could
have
made,
extending
over
a
period
of
seven
years
in
which
it
examined
the
causes
of
a
financial
calamity
that
occurred
in
this
country,
and
it
reached
the
conclusion
that...
that
conclusion
has
been
affirmed
by
this
court...
that
there
was
under
those
circumstances
a
fiduciary
relationship.
now,
the
reason
that
i
hesitate
in
applying
that
analogy
to
other
circumstances
is
that
i
think
you'd
have
to
have,
in
order
to
justify
applying
that
to
another
context,
you'd
have
to
have
something
like
that
kind
of
history,
supported
by
something
like
that
kind
of
congressional
determination,
in
the
overall
context
of
the
general
rule
that
in
making
those
kinds
of
determinations,
and
particularly
drawing
those
dividing
lines,
that
congress
and
legislatures
in
general
are
entitled
to
great
deference.
now,
let
me
just
say
in
that
regard,
any
way
you
decide
this
case
you're
going
to
have
to
make
some
very
tough
dividing
lines,
and
you're
going
to
have
some
tough
hypotheticals
that
are
going
to
be
on
the
one
side
or
on
the
other.
and
i
would
simply
submit
that
in
approaching
that
overall
very
important,
and
in
this
case
frankly
very
difficult
task,
that
the
court
should
find
it
helpful
to
rely
on
a
couple
of
general
mooring
places.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
the
one
is...
the
one
is
that
congress
has
made
that
determination;
and
the
second
is
that
there
was
an
unusually
good
congressional
record,
an
unusually
good
factual
record
supporting
what
congress
had
done.
and
i
think
probably
both
of
those
are
required.
now,
one
of
these
foundation
stones
is
the
general
proposition
that
in
marking
out
dividing
lines
congress
is
entitled
to
broad
discretion.
the
other
is
that
if
you
look
at
what's
involved
on
both
sides
of
this
case,
from
the
standpoint
of
avoiding
inhibitions
on
speech
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
how
it
is
that
first
amendment
values
are
really
advanced
by
protecting
written
published
advice
over
in
person
advice,
which
is
more
likely
to
be
oral.
both
are
speech,
and
i'm
unaware
of
anything
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
suggesting
that
written
speech
enjoys
a
preference
over
oral.
and
from
the
standpoint
of
congress'
objective,
which
was
to
prevent
repetition
of
the
kinds
of
conduct
that
led
to
one
of
the
greatest
financial
crises
in
our
nation's
history,
if
any
distinction
between
these
two
is
to
be
drawn
it
would
not
favor
the
protection
of
the
criminally
convicted
defrauder
to
influence
large
numbers
of
people
rather
than
just
a
few.
if
lowe
can
be
subjected
to
government
regulation
when
he
recommends
securities
to
one
client,
as
mr.
schoeman
says
that
he
can,
then
we
submit
that
he
may
also
be
subjected
to
regulation
when
he
sends
these
recommendations
by
publication
to
100
clients
or
1,000
or
3,000.
thank
you
very
much.
