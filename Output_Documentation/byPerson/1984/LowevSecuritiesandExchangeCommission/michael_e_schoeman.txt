mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
publishers
of
disinterested
information
and
opinion
about
securities
may
be
prohibited
from
publishing
on
the
ground
that
they
are
not
registered
under
the
investment
advisers
act
as
investment
advisers.
we
say
that
petitioners'
right
to
publish
on
a
matter
of
legitimate
public
interest
is
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
and
that
the
act
as
applied
to
publishers
is
an
unconstitutional
system
of
licensing
of
the
financial
press.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
the
petitioners
are
publishers
and
that
is
their
only
activity.
they
publish
newsletters
that
are
distributed
to
subscribers
by
mail,
and
these
publications
contain
information
about
the
stock
market,
recommendations
and
opinions
and
facts
about
specific
securities.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
personal
contact
with
any
readers,
no
evidence
of
any
personal
advice
or
handling
of
clients'
funds.
there's
no
allegation
of
trading
or
ownership
of
securities.
there's
no
allegation
that
any
of
the
advice
contained
in
the
publications
is
fraudulent
or
misleading
or
untruthful.
the
only
ground
on
which
petitioners
are
to
be
enjoined
is
that
they
are
not
registered
under
the
act.
at
one
point--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--that's
correct.
we
believe
that,
unfortunately,
capital
gains
research
bureau,
in
i
think
it's
375
u.s.,
resolved
the
question
of
whether
an
impersonal
publisher
is
subject
to
the
act,
and
we
felt
that
that
was
controlling.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
well,
it's--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes,
i
think
the
court
should
do
everything
it
can
to
avoid
reaching
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
don't
think
that
the
petitioners
necessarily
feel
that
they
can
only
exercise
their
rights
if
they
publish
on
a
regular
basis.
petitioners
have
a
right
to
publish
a
book,
for
example,
containing
the
same
information,
and
yet
that
doesn't
come
within
the
terms
of
the
exception.
i
would
think
the
real
problem
with
capital
gains
research
bureau
i
think
is
that
it
misread
the
legislative
history.
i
think
when
you
read
the
legislative
history,
particularly
the
excerpt
from
the
house
report
that
we
quote
on
page
7
of
our
brief,
it
is
clear,
to
me
at
least,
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
regulate
was
the
personalized
services
of
investment
advisers,
because
that's
what
they
said.
and
it's
also
true
that
in
the
sec
study
on
which
the
act
is
based
there
really
was
no
consideration
given
to
publications
that
distribute
to
you
personally
by
mail.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
well,
that's
an
unclear
question,
because
congress
didn't
really
define
what
"regular"
means.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
well,
mr.
lowe's
publications
are
scheduled
on
a
regular
basis,
but
they
haven't
been
published
on
a
regular
basis.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes,
sir.
i
would...
i
think
what
capital
gains
failed
to
do
is
to
interpret
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
first
amendment
problems
that
that
case
was
creating,
because
it
wasn't
argued
there,
apparently.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
that's
right.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
if
he
went
door
to
door
selling
his
publication?
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes.
if
all
he
was
doing
was
selling
the
publication--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--ah,
if
he
were
selling
securities.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
think
that
if
his
talking
to
the
customers
and
giving
them
literature
is
still
part
of
his
effort
to
engage
in
the
selling
and
buying
of
securities,
then
it's
very
much
in
the
nature
of
promotional
advertising,
i
think,
in
which
he
is
promoting
securities
and
his
objective
is
to
get
people
to
make
purchases
through
him.
i
think
that
it
then
comes
within
the
analysis
of
bolger
against
youngs
drug
products,
for
example,
in
which
some
of
the
material
was
informational
and
yet
the
objective
of
the
material
was
to
get
people
to
use
the
product
that
was
involved
there.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
well,
the
act
itself
requires
that
the
activity
be
done
for
compensation.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
think
if
an
individual
gives
a
speech
at
a
public
meeting
at
which
he
is
giving
his
own
opinions,
he
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
distinction
would
be
whether
he
solicited
or
obtained
specific
questions
from
people
about
their
personal
situations,
because
at
that
point
he
would
then
start
rendering
personalized
advice
to
people.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes,
it
is.
and
it's
just
a
distinction
it
seems
to
me
that's
been
drawn.
lawyers
are
regulated,
even
though
many
of
them
just
give
advice
and
perform
no
services
in
court,
for
example.
and
i
think
the
basis
of
the
distinction
is
that
the
lawyer
is
addressing
only
the
specific
interests
of
his
client.
he's
talking
just
about
his
client's
needs
and
he
has
entered
into
a
dialogue
with
his
client.
a
publisher
doesn't
know
what
his
client's
needs
are.
he
doesn't
know
who
his
readers
are,
except
possibly
by
name
where
there's
a
subscription
list.
he's
expressing
his
own
views,
and
it's
up
to
the
readers
and
the
public
at
large
to
determine
whether
that
piece
of
advice
fits
their
situation
or
does
not.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
because
the
first
amendment
i
think
is
certainly
concerned
with
public
discussion.
it
also
reaches
private
speech
when
that
private
speech
is
for
compensation.
we
have
a
tradition
in
this
country
of
regulation
of
those
kinds
of
communications
as
professions,
and
i
suppose
that
there
could
be
all
manner
of
professions.
but
there
has
to
be
a
line
drawn
between
personalized
communication
to
individual
persons
based
on
their
needs
and
public
discussion.
otherwise
you
would
have
what
the
government
is
arguing
for
in
this
case,
that
all
congress
needs
to
do
is
professionalize
a
subject
matter
and
they
can
then
license
not
only
the
personal
relationship,
but
they
can
license
public
discussion.
and
that's
what
this
act
has
done.
it's
an
attempt
by
congress
to
select
a
particular
subject
matter
in
which
congress
has
an
interest
and
to
say
that
only
certain
people
are
to
be
permitted
to
discuss
that
subject
matter.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
it
doesn't
have
any
collision
with
the
lawyer's
or
the
disbarred
lawyer's
right
to
publish.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
the
thing
that
the
lawyer...
the
lawyer
is
not
prevented,
i
think,
from
advising
people
if
he
doesn't
hold
himself
out
to
be
a
lawyer
or
if
he
doesn't
accept
compensation.
he
can
still
speak,
but
there
is
a
restriction
on
the
lawyer's
right--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--yes,
it
does.
but
it
does
not--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--because
it
does
not
interfere
with
that
lawyer's
or
ex-lawyer's
right
to
publish
a
law
review
article
on
how
to
comply
with
the
takeover
statute.
i'm
free
to
publish
a
law
review
article
in
california
telling
people
how
to
do
various
things
under
the
law,
although
i'm
not
a
lawyer
in
california.
i
can't
practice
there,
but
i
can
publish
there;
and
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
absolutely.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes,
sir.
what
he
can't
do
is
advise
people
based
on
their
specific
situations.
he
cannot
evaluate
whether
mr.
x
should
have
a
will
or
shouldn't
have
a
will,
or
should
have
an
inter
vivos
trust
or
shouldn't.
but
he
can,
like
mr.
dacey
in
new
york
county
lawyers
against
dacey,
publish
a
book
which
says
people
should
have
inter
vivos
trusts
in
order
to
avoid
probate.
this
question
has
come
up.
every
time
it's
come
up
in
state
supreme
courts
it's
been
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
distinction
that
i'm
suggesting
here.
personalized
communication
based
on
the
individual
situation
of
a
client
is
subject
to
regulation,
but
publication
to
the
public
in
general
not
based
on
the
particular
situation
of
readers--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--certainly.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
that's
right,
because
the
legislature
can't
say
that
certain
subjects
are
fit
for
public
discussion
and
certain
subjects
are
not.
whether
i
rely
on
mr.
lowe's
newsletter
or
someone
else's
newsletter
or
i
rely
on
my
broker
or
who
i
rely
on,
that's
up
to
me.
congress
cannot
cut
off
public
discussion.
it
can,
based
on
a
long
tradition
of
regulating
of
professions,
limit
and
control
to
some
extent
the
private
rendering
of
advice
to
individuals
based
on
their
individual
circumstances.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
four
times.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
three
of
them
involve
worthless
checks,
one
was
tampering
with
physical
evidence.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
that
was
a
is
demeanor.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
don't
think
they
can
do
that.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
think
the
chilling
effect
of
that
on
scaring
away
readers
and
on
scaring
away
mr.
lowe
from
publishing
would
be
too
severe.
the
government
charged
that--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--no,
i
do
not.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
he
is
prohibited.
that's
an
outright
prohibition.
i
wouldn't
call
that
chilling.
he's
prohibited
from
doing
it.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes,
sir.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
it
protects
untrue
reports,
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
that's
correct.
in
fact,
there
was
no
finding
or
even
allegation
that
it
ever
contained
any
false
information.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
but
that
certainly
is
what
the
court
held
in
near
against
minnesota,
that
here
was
something
that
was
regularly
published
and
found
to
have
regularly
contained
defamatory
material,
but
nevertheless
the
publication
of
that
newspaper
could
not
be
enjoined
in
the
future.
the
fact
that
someone
commits
a
wrong
in
the
past
or
several
wrongs
doesn't
tell
you
what
it
is
he's
going
to
publish
tomorrow.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes,
but
may
i
qualify.
the
sec's
order
revoked
the
registration
of
lowe
management
corporation,
which
is
one
of
the
petitioners,
and
it
ordered
that
mr.
lowe
not
be
associated
with
any
investment
adviser
in
the
future.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
well,
it's
the
other
petitioners.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
as
the
statute
apparently
reads,
for
two
of
the
corporate
petitioners
they
have
never
had
any
administrative
action
taken
against
them.
they
simply--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--no,
they
never
attempted
to.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
the
relevance
of
the
criminal
proceeding
is
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
how
we
fit
directly
under
the
disqualifications
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
legally
it
is
not,
since
we
didn't
have
to
apply
for
registration.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
the
criminal
proceeding
is
relevant
just
to
show
that
we
fit
within
the
statute,
that's
all,
in
terms
of
the
disqualifications.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
don't--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
because
this
act
applies
to
all
publishers
except
for
those
who
have
been
exempted
under
the
statute.
and
apparently
there
are
some
500
of
then
who
are
registered.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
statute
is
an
amalgam
of
the
worst
features
that
the
court
has
identified
over
the
years
in
connection
with
first
amendment
licensing.
it's
based
on
status,
it's
got
a
great
degree
of
discretion.
it's
discriminatory
and
discriminating
among
different
kinds
of
publications.
it's
a
content-based
regulation,
singling
out
a
particular
subject.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
well,
i
think
in
that
case
he
could
be
subject
to
regulation,
because--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--not
for
publication.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
because
it's
the
manipulation,
because
of
his
other
activity.
the
speech
in
that
situation
i
think
would
be
deemed
a
subordinate
part
of
his
other
activities.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
that's
correct.
but
that's
certainly
not
the
case
here.
there's
no
indication
of
any
such
conduct.
it
seems
to
me
the
commission's
argument
basically
puts
no
limit
on
congressional
power,
and
all
that
it
comes
down
to
is
that
congress
thought
that
there
was
a
good
reason
for
licensing
people
who
talk
about
this
subject.
i
have
no
problem
with
them
licensing
people
who
talk
for
compensation
on
a
personalized
basis
on
this
subject.
but
when
they
then
try
to
extend
that
concept
to
public
discussion
in
a
newsletter
distributed
impersonally,
that's
when
they
violate
the
prohibition
on
abridgment
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
because
the
court
has
on
numerous
indications
indicated
that
the
sale
of
a
publication
or
the
fact
that
a
publication
is
distributed
for
profit
doesn't
take
away
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
publisher.
and
that's
certainly
throughout
the
united
states.
almost
everything
that's
published
you
have
to
pay
for.
i
do
want
to
touch
for
a
moment
on
this
question
of
whether
we're
involved
in
commercial
speech.
i
say
we
are
not
involved
in
commercial
speech,
that
commercial
speech
essentially
means
advertising,
and
that
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
commercial
speech
is
speech
which
is
associated
with
the
speaker's
effort
to
sell
his
own
product
or
services,
and
we
do
not
fall
at
all
within
that
category.
i
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
think
the
solicitor
general
listed
two
reasons
as
to
why
investment
advisers
and
regulation
of
publications
containing
investment
advice
are
different
from
the
legal
situation.
one
was
that
congress
made
the
determination.
that
of
course
is
exactly
what
the
first
amendment
prohibits
congress
from
doing.
congress
may
not
abridge
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
the
press.
it's
not
for
congress
to
draw
the
line.
the
line
is
drawn
by
the
constitution.
secondly,
the
solicitor
general
said
there
is
an
unusually
good
record,
and
i
think
he
is
intimating
that
the
depression
was
caused
in
some
way
by
financial
publications.
there's
an
exceptionally
poor
record
on
that,
for
that
proposition.
there's
almost
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1940
act
that
in
any
way
relates
to
these
publishers.
they
were
included,
apparently,
without
very
much
attention
being
paid
to
it.
none
of
them
testified.
there's
no
record
of
what
any
of
them
were
doing.
they
were
not
covered
by
the
sec
survey.
there
may
be
circumstances,
conceivably,
in
which,
for
reasons
of
national
security
or
some
other
great
crisis,
you
have
to
have
more
regulation
of
publications
in
some
regard.
but
that
certainly
is
not
this
case.
what
the
petitioners
are
doing
is
simply
publishing
and
talking
about
a
subject
which
is
a
matter
of
legitimate
public
interest.
it's
a
subject
that's
widely
discussed,
without
licensing
i
may
add,
in
newspapers
and
magazines
and
on
television
and
radio.
you
may
not
always
be
able
to
find
out
what
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
said
on
any
given
day,
but
you
can
always
find
out
the
trading
price
of
ibm
stock.
it
is
a
subject
that's
widely
discussed,
and
there's
no
reason
why
mr.
lowe
cannot
participate
along
with
everybody
else
in
the
public
discussion--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--of
this
topic.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
really
don't
think
that
would
make
a
difference.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
the
fact
that--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--yes,
sir.
the
fact
that
in,
i
believe
it
was,
vance
against
universal
amusement
company,
universal
amusement
company
had
shown
a
pornographic
movie,
that's
no
basis
on
which
to
shut
down
the
movie
house.
simply
the
fact
that
mr.
near
published
repeatedly
this
defamatory
material,
that's
no
ground
on
which
to
shut
down
his
activity
in
the
future.
the
fact
of
past
misconduct
has
no
necessary
relationship
to
the
contents
of
a
future
publication.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
no.
in
capital
gains,
all
they
did
was,
as
i
read
it,
was
require
disclosure
of
his
trading
activity.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
he
was
allowed
to
continue
to
publish.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes,
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes,
i
think
so,
although
i
would
think
that
the
court
might
want
to
add
some
first
amendment
consideration
to
that
subject.
but
i
would
not
be
troubled
with
that
result.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
well,
if
a
person
is
actually
committing
a
fraud
through
the
use
of
his
publication,
as
was
the
case
in
capital
gain,
he
could
be
required
in
some
way
to
disclose
that
he
is
committing
that
fraud,
because
speech
is
not
his
only
activity.
fraud
is
his
activity.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
no,
he
would
have
to
describe,
as
he
was
required
to
in
capital
gain,
that
the
publisher
has
purchased
securities
discussed
in
this
publication
and
may
be
selling
them
if
the
price
goes
up.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
no,
i'm
not...
i
think
that
the
state
can
adopt
regulations
that
say,
if
you
want
to
call
yourself
a
lawyer
you
better
be
one,
if
you
want
to
call
yourself
a
registered
investment
adviser--
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
--well,
then
i
think
you
start
getting
into
the
chilling
effect.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
no,
i
don't
think
you're
there.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
think
the
chilling
effect
would
prohibit
that,
because
it
would
lead
him
not
to
publish
and
it
would
tend
to
have
people
not
read
the
publication.
what's
important
is
is
the
publication
a
valid
thing
to
be
read,
is
it
something
that
people
ought
to
read
or
at
least
ought
to
have
available,
or
should
they
be
pushed
away
from
it
by
chilling
effects?
and
i
distinguish
between
the
case
where
a
man
is
committing
a
a
fraud...
that
you
could
require
a
disclosure
about...
and
the
case
where
a
man
is
not
committing
a
fraud.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
yes,
i'm
not
troubled
by
that.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
although,
although
that's
a
hard
question,
because
he
may
not
be
engaged
in
fraudulent
activity.
he
may
simply
be
a
rich
man
who
owns
a
lot
of
stock.
mr.
michael
e.
schoeman
i
think
there'd
have
to
be
some
kind
of
rule
that
would
allow
us
to
determine
the
likelihood
of
a
fraud
actually
being
committed.
the
mere
fact
that
i
may
own
some
ibm
stock
shouldn't
necessarily
require
me
to
list
that
on
my
publication.
the
question
is
whether
i'm
engaging
in
a
fraudulent
activity,
and
not
what
securities
i
may
happen
to
own,
certainly.
thank
you.
