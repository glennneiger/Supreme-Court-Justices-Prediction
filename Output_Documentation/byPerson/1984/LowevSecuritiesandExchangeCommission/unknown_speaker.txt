unknown
speaker
mr.
schoeman,
you
did
not
petition
on
the
basis
of
an
argument
raised
below,
which
was
that
mr.
lowe
was
exempt
from
the
provisions
of
the
act;
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
maybe
that
question
might
be
open
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
we
decided
the
exemption
question
and
determined
that
the
act
didn't
cover
this
type
of
publication
or
that
it
was
exempt,
then
we
wouldn't
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
an
obligation,
then,
to
consider
that
in
an
effort
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
didn't
raise
it.
are
you
satisfied
that
there
is
no
exemption
under
the
act?
unknown
speaker
are
we
dealing
here
with
regular
publications,
though?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
publications
of
mr.
lowe.
unknown
speaker
like
law
reviews.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
if
you're
bound
by
that
case,
you're
client
is
covered?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
had
gone
out
door
to
door,
office
to
office,
in
the
typical
way
dealers
would
engage
in
their
activity
of
not
only
advising,
but
selling
securities,
after
all
of
his
licenses
had
been
revoked?
could
a
court
enjoin
that
activity?
unknown
speaker
well,
usually
they
did
it
by
telephone,
but
that
he
continued
doing
just
what
he
had
done
as
a
dealer
after
his
license
had
been
revoked.
now,
that
includes
a
great
deal
of
verbal
activity,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
not
the
publication.
i'm
talking
about
securities.
unknown
speaker
i'm
moving
away.
he's
acting
as
a
dealer,
selling
securities,
advising
people
and
selling
securities,
calling
them
on
the
phone,
having
conferences
with
them,
just
as
any
dealer
does.
and
then
his
license
is
revoked
and
he
continues,
and
the
court
enjoins
him.
can
the
court
enjoin
his
first
amendment
right,
as
you
put
it,
to
speak
to
these
customers
and
potential
customers?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
your
client
in
this
case
had
given
personal
advice
to
a
group
of
potential
purchasers
on
a
one
to
one
basis,
but
it
was
not
published,
but
it
was
nonetheless
nothing
that
he
intended
to
get
any
profit
out
of?
he
would
not
get
any
commissions
for
any
stock
that
was
sold.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
mean
he
would
bill
them,
you
know,
a
certain
amount
an
hour
and
say,
given
your
portfolio,
i
think
you
ought
to
pick
up
a
few
shares.
unknown
speaker
but
of
course
that's
nonetheless
speaking.
unknown
speaker
i
can
see
the
factual
difference,
but
why
does
that
make
a
difference
when
you're
interpreting
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
every
disbarment
or
suspension
of
a
lawyer
from
practice
has
some
collision
with
the
first
amendment
propositions
that
you're
advancing?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
speak.
unknown
speaker
i
should
have
made
my
hypothetical,
my
question,
a
little
more
clearly.
doesn't
the
disbarment
interfere
with
the
lawyer's
right
to
speak
to
clients
for
compensation
and
fees?
unknown
speaker
and
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
would
be
free
in
california
to
publish
a
newsletter
to
subscribers
interpreting
recent
decisions
say
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
or
trends
in
california
law,
and
collect
from
them
on
an
individual
basis
for
it?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
a
disbarred
lawyer
in
california
could
do
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
schoeman,
can
a
non-lawyer
publish
how-to-do-it
forms
telling
people
how
to
tailor
their
own
situation
to,
for
instance,
get
their
own
divorce
or
probate
their
own
will?
unknown
speaker
and
furnish
the
forms
and
describe
how
you
can
do
that
for
yourself?
unknown
speaker
even
though
you're
not
licensed?
unknown
speaker
and
the
same
with
a
medical
practice?
unknown
speaker
as
a
non-licensed
physician,
you
can
publish
directions
to
people
as
to
how
to
treat
their
illness?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
congress...
assuming
that
we
agreed
with
your
basic
proposition
that
the
first
amendment
protects
the
circulation
of
the
newsletter,
in
this
circumstance
he's
been
twice
convicted
of
felonies,
hasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
four
times.
and
they
are
felonies
related
somehow
to
the
securities
business?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't
the
worthless
checks
conviction
related
to
some...
he
got
$10,000
from
some
client
to
invest
and--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
was
that
it?
i
see.
my
question
is
this:
could
the
commission
have
a
regulation
that
says
that,
while
we
can't
stop
you
from
circulating
this
newsletter,
we
require
that
you
include
in
the
newsletter
a
statement
that
you've
been
convicted
of
these
felonies?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
have
you
any
precedent
to
suggest
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
you
don't
have
a
precedent
in
the
securities
field?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
disbarred
lawyer
is
chilled
from
talking
to
clients
for
pay,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
chills
him
from
trying
it
again.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
far
does
your
position
go?
taking
justice
brennan's
line,
suppose...
does
the
first
amendment
protect
false
reports
in
these
investment
newsletters?
unknown
speaker
to
the
same
extent
as
it
protects
other
untrue--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
just
because
this
newsletter
has
several
times
contained
or
regularly
contains
false
reports
would
be
no
basis
for
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
that's
not
my
question.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
that's
prompted
by
justice
brennan's
question.
am
i
correct
that
the
only
administrative
order
was
the
one
that
cancelled
his
registration?
there's
no
administrative
order
directing
him
not
to
publish
these
papers?
it's
the
result
of
separate
litigation?
unknown
speaker
and
who
is
the
investment
adviser
that
he
is
being
associated
with
now?
unknown
speaker
the
corporate
entities?
unknown
speaker
and
so
presumably,
even
if
there
had
been
no
criminal
violations
of
any
kind,
they
could
be
enjoined
from
publishing
these
papers
because
they
are
acting
as
investment
advisers
and
they're
not
registered,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
had
they
ever
qualified
as
investment
advisers?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
the
relevance
of
the
criminal
proceeding.
is
the
case
any
different
than
if
just
some
stranger
who
had
never
been
an
investment
adviser
started
to
publish
these
papers?
unknown
speaker
but
the
net
effect
of
all
that
is
that
they
justify
the
revocation
of
your
registration.
and
why
is
that
legally
any
different
than
if
you
had
never
even
applied
for
registration?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
true,
then
is
the
criminal
proceeding
even
relevant?
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
unknown
speaker
so
you
fit
within
it
because
you're
not
registered.
well,
it
might
be
that
someone
who
just
starts
a
newsletter
without
registering,
it
may
be
that
he
might
be
treated
different
constitutionally
than
someone
who's
been
convicted
of
a
crime
after
registration.
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
the
government's
argument
would
equally
fit
the
person
who
starts
a
newsletter
without
registration
and
he
has
no
criminal
record.
unknown
speaker
who
are
registered.
unknown
speaker
or
who
are
registered.
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
the
newsletter
touted
a
bunch
of
stocks
and
it
was
shown
that
it
provoked
buying
and
then
the
publisher
made
a
profit
off
of
it,
off
of
the
stock?
he
bought
stocks
and
then
sold
them.
unknown
speaker
but
not
for
publication?
unknown
speaker
but
for
manipulation.
unknown
speaker
just
like
a
broker-dealer.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
they
sell
that
publication
or
give
it
away?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
this
is
the
question
i
asked
your
adversary:
would
it
not
be
the
same
case
if
he
had
never
committed
a
crime
and
had
never
applied
for
registration,
just
published
precisely
what
he's
published
here?
unknown
speaker
so
really
the
criminal
history
is
totally
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
have
an
eccentric
publisher
who
just
doesn't
believe
in
licensing
the
press.
unknown
speaker
and
never
apply.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
the
same
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
take
it
that
your
case
depends
on
that,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
cannot
achieve
that
your
case
is
down
the
drain.
unknown
speaker
either
in
writing
or
orally?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that's
no
different
generally
than
the
decision
of
any
state
to
regulate
the
lawyers
practicing
in
it.
now,
consistent
with
your
view,
i
suppose
a
state
could
prohibit
a
disbarred
lawyer
or
a
non-lawyer,
if
the
criminal
history
is
irrelevant,
from
writing
a
newsletter
for
subscribers
about
recent
developments
in
california
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
under
your
analysis
would
it
be
different
in
this
case
if
mr.
lowe
had
had
no
previous
financial
dealings
with
the
particular
people
who
subscribed
to
his
newsletter?
he
just
sets
up
shop
and
says:
i
know
a
lot
about
stocks,
i'm
publishing
a
newsletter,
you
can
have
it
for
25
bucks
a
week.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
answer
with
respect
to
lawyers
is
quite
different
from
your
answer
with
respect
to
securities.
unknown
speaker
but
a
state
legislature
could
make
precisely
that
determination
with
respect
to
a
disbarred
lawyer
or
an
unlicensed
lawyer
who
simply
solicited
people
for
a
newsletter,
although
he
never
advised
them
in
any
legal
sense.
and
that
would
make
that
the
same
case,
unless
there's
a
difference
between
securities
brokers
and
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
along
that
line,
could
the
legislature
of
a
state
pass
a
law
that
no
disbarred
lawyer
can
publish
a
paper?
unknown
speaker
you're
getting
awful
close.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
a
lawyer
publish
an
article,
a
column
in
the
newspaper?
unknown
speaker
could
he
give
legal
advice
in
that
column?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it's
only
legal
news.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
the
legislature
could
pass
a
law
saying
that
a
disbarred
lawyer
may
not
participate
in
any
transmission
of
legal
advice
by
newspaper?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can't
have
a
fiduciary
relationship
between
a
disbarred
lawyer
and
the
general
public,
no
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
general
lee,
if
the
purpose
that
congress
has
in
mind
is
to
protect
the
public
from
unscrupulous
advisers
in
the
financial
field,
why
isn't
that
interest
fully
served
by
simply
requiring
full
disclosure
of
the
background
of
this
publisher?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
in
the
context
of
the
publication
of
investment
advice
newsletters,
not
the
person
to
person
selling
of
securities.
unknown
speaker
as
applied
to
the
publications
we
have
here,
which
are,
after
all,
apparently
available
for
the
purchase
of
anyone
who
wants
to
subscribe,
whether
they
were
formerly
clients
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
the
test
we've
employed
for
commercial
speech,
which
you
argue
this
is?
don't
we
look
at
that
very
thing?
unknown
speaker
what
page,
please?
unknown
speaker
page
2.
i'm
sorry.
"the
power
to
license
professionals
extends
only
to
persons
who
render
personal
service
or
advice
and
cannot
under
the
first
amendment
include
persons
who
merely
publish."
now,
if
that
statement
is
correct
that
under
the
first
amendment
government
is
powerless
to
regulate
those
who
merely
publish,
as
opposed
to
those
who
give
in
person
advice,
then
government
would
have
been
powerless
to
do
exactly
what
it
did
in
the
capital
gains
case,
namely
to
require
the
disclosures
that
were
required
in
that
case.
and
the
reason
is
that,
while
there
is
the
difference
that
in
this
instance
what
the
government
has
done
is
prohibit
publication
and
in
capital
gains
it
required
publication,
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
in
cases
like
the
west
virginia
flag
salute
case
and
the
new
hampshire
license
plate
case...
this
is
a
direct
quote
from
the
license
plate
case...
that
"the
first
amendment
includes
both
the
right
to
speak
freely
and
the
right
to
refrain
from
speaking
at
all."
so
that
the
line
that
congress
drew,
we
submit,
is
an
appropriate
one
and
is
a
constitutional
one,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
effectiveness
of
requiring
lowe
simply
to
disclose
what
he
has
done
in
the
past
and
to
prohibit
him
from
publishing
at
all.
that
was
the
effect,
that
was
the
precise
effect
of
what
happened
in
capital
gains.
mr.
lee,
you
may
be
right
about
capital
gains,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
your
colleague
an
the
other
side
would
agree
with
you
that
the
result
would
be
different
in
capital
gains.
i
thought
he
said
that
if
an
investment...
if
a
publisher
of
this
information,
of
this
newsletter,
touted
stock
and
then
bought
in
and
then
sold
out
when
the
price
went
up,
that
that
could
be...
that
the
commission
could
stop
that.
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
doesn't
agree
with
you,
then,
because
capital
gains
could
easily
have
come
out
the
same
way
under
that
view?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
let
me
go
back
for
a
moment,
because
i'm
still
wrestling
with
this
in
my
mind,
to
the
hypothetical
about
your
mailing
list
of
the
trade
association,
is
what
prompted
the
question.
supposing
you
had
a
law
review
published
by
law
students
who
were
not
admitted
to
the
bar,
just
writing
on
recent
developments
in
tax
law,
and
people
who
were
interested
in
tax
law
began
to
subscribe
to
it.
could
the
state
prohibit
the
publication
of
that?
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
could?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
it
has
the
same
fiduciary
definition--
unknown
speaker
--that
your
concept
does.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
you
had
a
group
of
business
school
students
who
got
interested
in
the
stock
market
and
they
started
to
publish
a
counterpart
to
a
law
review
on
investments
in
utility
stocks
or
trends
in
the
gold
market
or
something
like
that
and
they
publicize
it,
and
either
with
the
sponsorship
of
the
school
or
just
independently
to
make
some
money.
i
suppose
they...
how
do
you
compare
that
with
the--
unknown
speaker
--and
why
is
one
a
fiduciary
and
the
other
not?
i
guess
that's
my
question.
unknown
speaker
what
was
your
other
reason?
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
you
said
for
two
reasons.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you--
unknown
speaker
--a
question
on
that,
that
subject.
supposing
that
the
revocation
of
his
registration
had
been
based
on
publishing
misleading
information
in
these
very
publications
and
touting
stock
and
then
profiting
from
it
himself
and
that
sort
of
thing,
so
that
he'd
misused
these
publications.
unknown
speaker
that
was
going
to
be
my
question.
you'd
say
even
then
they
could
not
require
that
he
cease
publishing
these
papers?
unknown
speaker
disassociate
himself
from
them
for
the
future?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
agree
that
capital
gains
would
have
to
come
out
differently
if
you
win
this
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
capital
gains
would
come
out
the
same
way,
even
if
you
win?
unknown
speaker
and
you
concede
that...
you
concede
that
they
could
require
this
disclosure
if
the
activity
he
engaged
in
was
the
activity
in
capital
gains?
unknown
speaker
what
precise
disclosure
is
that?
past
criminal--
unknown
speaker
--well
then,
he
in
the
publication
would
have
to
say,
i'm
committing
a
fraud
by
publishing
this?
unknown
speaker
how
about...
but
you
say
he
could
not
be
required
to
say
whether
or
not
he
is
a
registered
investment
adviser
under
the
act?
unknown
speaker
could
you
require
him
to
say
whether
he
ever
was
and
why
he
isn't
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
start,
but
are
