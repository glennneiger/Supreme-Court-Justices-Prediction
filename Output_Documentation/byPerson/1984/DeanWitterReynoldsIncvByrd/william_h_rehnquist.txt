i
suppose
our
judgment,
if
we
were
to
make
it,
that
wilco
was
not
applicable
to
a
claim
under
the
'34
act,
ever
though
that
question
is
not
squarely
presented,
might
affect
our
judgment
as
to
the
force
of
the
intertwining
argument.
justice
rehnquist
what
is
wrong
with
the
federal
court
having
to
defer
on
the
same
set
of
operative
facts
to
litigation
in
some
other
forum
on
factual
questions?
that
doesn't
prevent
their
decision
on...
making
a
federal
decision
on
the
law.
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
is
true
in
any
case
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel,
but
why
shouldn't
ordinary
principles
of
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata
apply
to
a
federal
securities
act
claim
just
like
any
other
claim
that
is
made
in
federal
court?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
reason
it
wouldn't
occur
is
because
of
objections
you
make
to
speedy
arbitration,
it
seems
to
me.
i
mean,
these
aren't
objections
that
the
party
seeking
arbitration
is
making.
these
are
blocks
that
you
are
putting
up.
if
you
would
remove
the
blocks
you
put
up,
there
would
be
a
speedy
arbitration.
justice
rehnquist
well,
as
long
as
you
are
right
on
the
wilco
issue.
if
you
are
right
on
wilco.
yes.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
it
were
arbitrated
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
california?
is
there
a
judicial
authority
as
to
whether
punitive
damages
may
be
awarded
by
an
arbitration
under
a
california
arbitration
contract?
justice
rehnquist
that,
too,
is
kind
of
inconsistent
with
the
theory
of
arbitration,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
you
don't
take
a
set
of
rights
into
court...
that
you
have
in
court
into
arbitration.
the
whole
purpose
of
arbitration
is
to
speed
things
up
and
get
a
quick
resolution,
not
to
track
in
a
bunch
of
judicial
remedies.
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
see
why.
you
are
entitled
to
your
opinion,
obviously.
so
am
i.

[generallaughter.]
justice
rehnquist
is
that
an
issue
in
this
case
whether
apart
from
the
securities
act
rule
of
wilco
this
contract
would
have
been
enforceable
under
california
law?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
i--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
but
i
take
it
someone
under...
someone
who
is
assigned
an
arbitration
contract
under
california
law
is
presumably
bound
by
it
unless
it
was
not
enforceable
under
the
law
of
california.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
rehnquist
so
isn't
the
question
before
the
district
judge
is
this
contract
enforceable
under
california
law?
justice
rehnquist
he
doesn't
have
to
go
into
all
the
other
factors.
once
he
decides
it
is
enforceable,
whether
or
not
he
thinks
the
party
got
a
good
exchange
for
his
bargain
really
doesn't
matter,
does
it?
