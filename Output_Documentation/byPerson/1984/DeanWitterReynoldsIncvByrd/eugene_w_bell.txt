mr.
eugene
w.
bell
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
today,
i
believe,
because
the
district
court
did
precisely
that
which
this
court
subsequently
declared
in
its
decision
southland
versus
keating
that
a
federal
judge
should
not
do.
that
is,
the
district
court
undermined
the
expectations
of
the
petitioner
who
desired
arbitration
pursuant
to
a
contract
related
to
interstate
commerce.
this
case
involves
a
civil
suit
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
by
a
customer
against
the
securities
broker/dealer.
the
complaint
asserts
four
claims
under
state
law,
all
of
which
are
subject
to
a
valid
preexisting
agreement
to
arbitrate.
the
customer,
in
addition
to
asserting
those
four
state
law
claims,
asserts
one
claim
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934.
the
petitioner
sought
arbitration
of
the
four
state
law
claims,
but
the
district
court
denied
that
arbitration,
because
that
court
in
its
subjective
determination
felt
that
the
factual
and
legal
issues
involved
in
all
of
the
claims
were
intertwined.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
this
regard,
the
ninth
circuit
is
joined
by
two
other
circuits
who
have
come
down
in
effect
in
the
same
way
on
a
similar
issue.
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
there
are
three
circuits
that
have
come
down
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
issue.
thus,
there
is
an
even
split
between
six
circuits
that
have
considered
this
issue
called
intertwining.
the
question
thus
presented
today
is
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
denying
the
petitioner's
motion
for
an
order
compelling
arbitration
of
the
respondent's
state
law
claims
and
staying
that
arbitration
pending
judicial
resolution
of
the
respondent's
claim
under
the
federal
securities
laws.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
yes?
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
if
you
are
talking
collateral
estoppel,
i
do
not
believe
so,
because
the
mechanisms
of
arbitration
generally
are
such.
there
are
no
findings
of
fact.
there
is
no
record.
there
is
really
nothing
that
would
be
available
to
a
court,
state
or
federal,
subsequently
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
decided
that
would
really--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--absolutely
not.
the
facts
underlying
this
case
are
as
follows.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
no,
sir.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
i
personally
would
subscribe
to
the
dickenson
theory
approach,
and
that
is
one
of
the
circuits
that
have
decided
against
intertwining,
and
it
feels
that
the
protections
afforded
under
the
'34
act
are
better
served
by
reserving
to
the
federal
district
court
the
right
of
priority
to
determine
the
federal
securities
law
claim
and
thus
stay
the
arbitration
until
that
federal
securities
law
claim
has
in
fact
been
determined.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
i
am
sorry.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
yes,
i
do.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
yes.
yes,
that
is
our
position.
if
the
facts
underlying
this
claim
are
as
follows.
as
alleged
by
the
respondent
in
his
complaint--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--that
is
the
subsidiary
question
involved
here,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
yes,
i
intend
to
address
that.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
initially
i
was
just
going
to
give
you
a
little
of
the
background
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
according
to
the
complaint,
the
securities
broker/dealer
or
his
registered
representative,
its
registered
representative
advised
dr.
byrd
that
if
he
were
to
sell
his
dental
practice
and
invest
some
$160,000
into
the
stock
market
under
the
management
of
this
registered
representative,
that
the
dentist
would
receive
about
$4,000
a
month,
i
assume
in
perpetuity,
or
at
least
for
his
lifetime
for
annual
income.
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
registered
representative
altered
the
client
information
forms
in
certain
ways.
it
further
alleges
that
after
the
account
was
open
for
a
short
period,
that
the
registered
representative
engaged
in
unauthorized
trading
for
this
account,
and
that
the
registered
representative
started
dealing
in
options,
and
in
naked
options.
the
complaint
further
alleges
that
both
the
registered
representative
and
the
branch
office
manager
in
this
particular
branch
assured
the
plaintiff
that
the
account
was
okay
and
that
everything
was
doing
well,
even
though
the
statements
in
the
confirms
might
have
indicated
otherwise
to
the
doctor,
and
in
fact
when
the
account
apparently
had
lost
about
$100,000.
now,
out
of
this
common
nucleus
of
fact,
the
doctor
alleges
violations
of
the
california
state
securities
laws,
alleges
common
law
fraud
and
deceipt,
alleges
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
on
behalf
of
the
broker/dealer
firm,
and
alleges
negligence,
and
with
respect
to
three
of
those
claims
he
is
seeking
punitive
damages
which
clearly
are
not
available
under
a
section
10(b)
claim.
he
lastly
alleges
also
a
section
10(b)
claim.
now,
the
court,
as
we
have
said,
indicated
that
the
facts
and
the
legal
issues
were
so
intertwined
that
to
separate
those
issues
and
to
send
the
four
claims
to
arbitration
after
first
adjudicating
the
10(b)(5)
claim
would
be
a
waste
of
efficiency.
the
problems
with
that
decision
and
the
intertwining
theory
are
both
legal
and
practical.
first,
from
a
legal
standpoint,
the
court
seems
not
to
be
listening
to
the
music
of
cone
when
cone
indicated
that
the
federal
court
should
have
a
healthy
regard
for
the
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
had
mentioned
or
i
had
mentioned
just
prior
to
the
adjournment
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
similar
circuit
opinions
had
caused
some
legal
problems.
i
mentioned
the
language
in
the
cone
case
where
this
court
recited
a
healthy
regard
for
a
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration,
and
likewise
in
the
keating
case
this
court
stated
that
contracts
to
arbitrate
are
not
to
be
avoided
by
allowing
one
party
to
ignore
the
contract
and
resort
to
the
courts.
now,
the
decisions
of
the
ninth,
fifth,
and
eleventh
circuits
are
in
contravention
of
those
statements,
and
they
are
frustrating
the
rights
of
parties
who
feel
that
they
are
entitled
to
arbitration
pursuant
to
a
valid
contract
to
get
that
arbitration.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
i
recognize,
sir,
that--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--mr.
justice
white,
if
you
would
permit
me,
i
am
not
saying
that
that
is
what
i
would
want
to
do.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
i
am
saying
that
that
is
what
the
dickenson--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--that
is
correct,
and
i
am--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--well,
we
are
stuck
with
the
wilco
case,
at
least
to
this
point,
but--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--then
there
would
be
no
intertwining
because
there
would
be
no
federal
claim
subject--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
i
would
like
to.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
i
would
like
to
have
this
court
revisit
whether
or
not
wilco
applies
to
'34
act
claims
or
10(b)(5)
claims
because
of
the
distinctions
that
this
court
noted
itself
in
the
scherk
case,
those
distinctions
primarily
being
the
fact
that
10(b)(5)
or
the
rights
created
to
sue
under
10(b)(5)
are
not
expressly
provided
in
the
'34
act.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
special
rights
under
the
'33
act,
but
those
special
rights
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
1934
act,
and
this
court
analyzed
that
proposition
in
the
scherk
case
and
in
my
opinion
came
very
close
to
providing
one
with
a
platform
to
say
that
the
wilco
rationale,
the
wilco
holding
does
not
apply
to
a
claim
brought
as
an
implied
private
right
of
action
under
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
act.
it
is
my
view
that
it
does
not
apply,
but
the
courts
below
primarily,
and
certainly
the
ninth
circuit
have
just
assumed
that
this
court's
holding
in
wilco
with
regard
to
section
12(2)
of
the
1933
act--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--they
have
all
assumed
it.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
they
have
all
assumed
it,
and
it
is
out
of
that
assumption
that
this
intertwining
policy
really
has
grown,
but
even
if
this
court,
to
continue
for
a
moment
on
wilco,
even
if
this
court
were
to
use
this
opportunity,
the
subsidiary
question
to
make
the
pronouncement
that
wilco
does
not
apply
to
claims
brought
as
implied
rights
under
the
'34
act,
that
wouldn't
remove
the
intertwining
argument,
because
that
argument
could
then
next
be
presented
in
connection
with
a
situation
where
there
is
an
express
statutory
right
and
a
special
right
of
the
type
that
this
court
determined
in
wilco
attaches
to
section
12(2)
of
the
1933
act,
and
someone
then
could
bring
a
case
that
would
combine
a
claim
that
is
specifically,
let's
say,
brought
with
regard
to
section
12(2)
of
the
'33
act
and
move
into
that
claim
on
the
common
nucleus
of
facts
stakeoff
claims
that
would
be
subject
to
arbitration,
and
the
intertwining
argument
would
then
raise
its
ugly
head
again.
so,
while
we
would
encourage
this
court
to
take
a
look
at
whether
wilco
does
apply
in
fact
to
implied
rights
brought
under
section
10(b),
we
can't
stop
there
we
must
also
look
at
the
intertwining,
whether
or
not
that
fits
with
this
court's
and
congress's
scheme
of
things
that
it
provided
for
in
arbitration.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
it
does,
and
justice
white
brought
up
this
question.
my
personal
view
is
that
to
give
full
force
and
effect
to
the
congressional
mandate
favored
in
arbitration
is
a
speedy
remedy,
but
the
arbitration
should
proceed
the
more
lengthy
judicial
resolution
of
the
claims
brought
that
are
not
subject
to
arbitration.
i
think
there
would
be
great
benefits
to
be
derived
from
that.
it
is
subjective,
but
that
is
my
personal
opinion.
the
reasoning,
however,
of
the
court
in
the
dickenson
case,
and
that
is
the
landmark
case
that
says
intertwining
is
bad,
the
reasoning
of
the
court
there
is
that
if
you
were
to
allow
the
arbitration
to
go
first,
it
might
somehow
interfere
with
the
federal
court's
exclusive
rights
under
the
'34
act
to
determine
actions
that
are
brought
to
it
under
the
'34
act.
i
am
just
adopting
for
the
purposes
of
our
motion
and
what
is
before
here,
i
have
adopted
the
dickenson
rationale
and
approach.
certainly
procedurally
that
is
what
i
adopted,
but
we
do
not
embrace
that
approach.
i
would
respect
your
suggestion
and
certainly
justice
white's
suggestion
that
perhaps
a
more
practical
way
of
approaching
it
is
to
permit
the
arbitration
to
proceed
first,
and
to
let
the--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--i
am
not
sure,
justice
stevens,
that
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
i
don't
believe
so,
sir,
because
while
there
are,
as
you
correctly
noted,
provisions
for
in
effect
converting
an
arbitration
award
into
a
judgment,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
do
not
have
before
the
court,
in
the
case
i
have
seen,
you
do
not
have
findings
of
fact
from
the
arbitrators.
you
really...
you
don't
have
anything
to
guide
any
subsequent
court
other
than
a
one-page
award
that
says
the
claimant
shall
receive
x,
or
the
claimaint
shall
not
receive
anything.
there
is
nothing
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
would
indicate
what
factual
issues,
what
legal--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--i
recognize
the
possibility
of
that.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
i
recognize
the
possibility.
i
am
just
saying
that--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--in
practical
life
it
doesn't
really
happen.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
if
it
did
happen
that
way,
and
there
were
findings,
and
in
effect
it
was
confirmed
by
a
judgment
of
a
court,
you
would
have
a
much
stronger
argument
for
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
well,
with
regard
to...
as
you
know,
justice
brennan,
with
regard
to
section
10(b)(5)
claims,
or
claims
under
the
'34
act
anyway,
that
act
by
its
own
language
does
not
permit
damages
beyond
actual
damages
suffered
by
the
plaintiff.
that
in
my
opinion
is
the
reason
that
almost
every
plaintiff
seeking...
bringing
a
garden
variety
lawsuit
these
days
against
a
security
broker
tries
to
drag
in
state
law
claims
upon
which
he
can
seek
punitive
damages.
it
leads
to
confusion
of
the
jury.
it
leads
to
multiple
instructions,
sometimes
that
apparently
are--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--well,
that
issue
i
know
has
been
decided
in
the
state
of
new
york,
and
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
new
york
has
held
that
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
arbitrators
are
not
permitted
to
award
punitive
damages.
to
my
knowledge,
that
is
the
only
state
that
has
ruled
on
that
proposition.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
of
course
it
does.
particularly
when
you
have
a
situation
where
the
access
to
the
federal
court
in
the
first
place
is
a
claim
under
the
'34
act
that
doesn't
permit
punitive
damages,
and
yet
in
every
one
of
these
cases
they
are
seeking
punitive
damages.
it
seems
to
me
an
anomaly
that
should
not
be
tolerated
by
the
court
system,
and
one
way
of
doing
it
is
giving
full
force
and
effect
to
the
arbitration
agreement.
this
court
has
declared
that
parties
cannot
avoid
arbitration
by
resorting
to
court.
they
did
that
in
january
of
this
year
in
the
keating
case,
and
yet
it
is
happening
every
day,
and
the
courts
are
still
permitting
it.
i
sincerely
believe,
and
of
course
the
state
of
california
very
frequently
and
most
recently
has
again
embraced
arbitration
of
disputes
between
customers
and
their
stockbrokers,
and
it
says
if
there
is
a
valid
arbitration
agreement,
we
are
going
to
enforce
it,
and
you
must
arbitrate
those
claims.
so,
the
plaintiff
now,
under
the
approach
of
the
ninth
circuit,
all
he
has
to
do
is
take
those
same
claims
across
the
street
to
the
federal
court,
add
on
a
claim
or
an
alleged
claim
under
the
'34
act,
and
say
i
am
home
free,
i
do
not
have
to
arbitrate,
and
that
is
one
of
the
evils,
i
believe,
of
the
intertwining
approach.
this
court
further
has
declared
in
the
prima
paint
case
that
with
regard
to
an
application
under
section
3
of
the
arbitration
act
that
the
court
can
consider
only
two
issues.
in
the
southland
case
it
specified
these
more
precisely.
only
two
limitations
on
a
party's,
right
to
arbitrate.
one
is
the
arbitration
clause,
part
of
a
written
contract
or
a
maritime
agreement
or
a
written
contract
affecting
and
arising
out
of
interstate
commerce,
and
i
think
it
is
beyond
peradventure
now
that
these
margin
agreements
and
agreements
with
regard
to
option
accounts
that
contain
arbitration
clauses
in
many
instances,
not
uniformly,
are
certainly
contracts
arising
out
of
interstate
commerce.
the
only
other
limitation
that
this
court
said
in
the
keating
case
would
affect
a
party's
right
to
arbitrate
are
such
limitations
that
are
provided
by
either
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
well,
it
escapes
me
whether
it
is
anything
in
the
intertwining
theory
that
speaks
of
that
being
a
ground
to
revoke
the
arbitration
clause
itself.
it
is
not.
it
is
more
of
a
procedural
argument.
these
statements
of
congress
mandating
arbitration
and
the
statements
of
this
court
simply
leave
no
room
for
denying
arbitration
on
the
basis
of
some
subjective
and,
i
submit,
debatable
theory
that
the
arbitration
claims
are
intertwined.
in
your
recent
cone
decision,
this
court
recognized
that
if
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
give
full
force
and
effect
to
a
valid
arbitration
clause,
that
you
must
divide
the
dispute
and
have
that
dispute
resolved
in
separate
forums,
that
that
should
be
done,
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
petitioner
is
requesting
be
done
here,
is
that
if
in
fact
claims
under
the
'34
act
or
10(b)(5)
are
not
subject
to
arbitration,
then
we
want
the
claims
divided,
and
the
court
recognized
that
as
a
valid
principle
in
the
cone
case.
the
ninth
circuit
and
other
circuits
have
attempted
to
rationalize
their
holding
using
wilco
as
a
basis
for
the
rationalization,
but
that
rationalization
fails
for
these
reasons.
first,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
wilco
involved
what
this
court
perceived
to
be
a
conflict
between
two
congressionally
mandated
statutes
and
ended
up
in
its
analysis
saying
one
prevailed
over
the
other.
that
is
quite
a
different
story
that
we
have
here,
when
we
have
a
clear
congressional
mandate
favoring
arbitration,
and
for
a
court
to
say
we
have
some
theory
here
regarding
an
implied
right
of
action
that
will
overcome
that
congressional
mandate.
it
seems
that
doesn't
square
with
wilco.
this
court
in
the
keating
case
made
reference
in
a
footnote
to
an
attempt
by
the
california
supreme
court
to
analogize
wilco,
and
this
court
stated
that
wilco
was
two
federal
congressional
statutes,
and
that
it
is
a
far
different
thing
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
state's
attempt
to
legislate
a
new
exception
to
arbitration,
and
this
court
didn't
buy
that,
and
said
that
the
state
could
not
legislate
a
new
method
to
escape
arbitration.
well,
if
a
state
can't
legislate
it,
how
can
a
federal
judge
create
it?
i
will
just
finish
with
wilco.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
yes.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
i
don't
believe
that
that
has
been
precisely
decreed,
justice
stevens.
the
courts
have
used
the
word
"judicial
resolution
of
the
federal
securities
law
claim.
"
"i
assume
judicial
resolution
includes
the
full
rights
of
appeal.
"
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
it
might
be.
but
once
again,
that
might
indicate
that
perhaps
a
preferable
way
to
go
is
to
permit
the
arbitration
to
precede
the
trial
of
the
federal
securities
law
claim.
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
the
other
thing
which
we
mentioned
where
the
wilco
analogy
fails,
i
believe,
is
that
the
wilco
analogy
did
have
the
two
congressional
statutes
as
opposed
to
an
implied
right,
and
i
will
just
touch
briefly
in
the
time
that
i
am
going
to
have
left
here
on
the
practical
consequences
of
the
intertwining
theory.
it
leads
to
forum
shopping.
we
have
already
discussed
that,
people
looking
around...
now
they
look
around
for
the
right
circuit,
in
addition
to
the
right
state
or
federal
court.
it
leads
to
uncertainties.
how
can
a
lawyer
advise
a
client
for
whom
he
has
drafted
an
interstate
commerce
type
contract
that
contains
an
arbitration,
how
can
he
say
the
courts
will
enforce
this
arbitration,
because
any
clever
lawyer
trying
to
break
it
can
just
invent
some
claim
perhaps
which
is
not
subject
to
arbitration
under
some
decree
of
this
court
and
"intertwine"
it
and
it
would...
just
rank
uncertainty
as
to
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
clauses.
the
other
thing
that
of
course
it
would
do,
if
you
read
the
language
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
this
case,
it
encourages
the
federal
district
courts
to
use
their
own
discretion
in
analyzing
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
to
see
if
in
their
determination
there
is
factual
and
legal
intertwining.
it
would
create
just
a
morass
of
additional
burdens
on
the
district
court.
every
time
one
of
these
cases
come
in,
they
have
to
take
the
time,
analyze
the
complaint
or
the
pleadings
to
that
state
to
determine
first
if
there
is
intertwining
and
then
go
from
there.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance.
thank
you.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
it
is
of
interest
to
me
that
the
attention
of
the
argument
focused
quickly
on
punitive
damages,
which
are,
of
course,
not
available
under
the
federal
laws.
doesn't
that
indicate
that
the
state
issues
substantially
predominate
in
this
case,
and
if
that
is
the
case,
shouldn't
we
look
to
this
court's
reasoning
in
united
mine
workers
versus
gibbs,
where
this
court,
in
talking
about
the
entertaining
of
pendent
claims
stated
that
if
the
state
issues
substantially
predominate,
if
there
would
be
different
levels
of
proof,
likelihood
of
perhaps
confusion
of
the
court
or
the
jury,
that
the
court
should
feel
free
to
dismiss
those
pendent
claims
rather
than
retainment.
and
the
argument--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--i
agree
that
there
are
cases
that
so
hold.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
the
ninth
circuit
has
awarded
punitive
damages
under...
has
affirmed
the
award
of
punitive
damages
when
a
10(b)(5)
claim
was
tried
along
with
state
claims
and
said
that
while
we
can't--
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
--beg
pardon?
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
for
the
state
claims
only.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
the
state
claims
only.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
no,
because
under...
the
claims
would
be
referred
to
arbitration.
mr.
eugene
w.
bell
and
to
return
to
the
question
asked
earlier
about
arbitration,
i
believe
the
rationale
of
the
new
york
state
opinion
with
regard
to
an
arbitrator's
power
to
award
punitive
damage
would
be
applied
in
almost
any
state
that
considered
it,
and
that
is
that
punitive
damages
are
not
a
matter
of
a
plaintiff's
right.
it
is
a
way
that
a
state
has
or
a
judicial
system
has
of
enforcing
its
policies
and
making
sure
that
people
don't
have
reckless
disregard
for
those
policies,
and
they
are
assessed
against
a
person
for
reckless
conduct.
they
are
not
awarded
to
anybody.
he
just
happens
to
be
the
incidental
beneficiary.
so,
punitive
damages
aren't
a
matter
of
right,
and
i
can
see
why
the
state
would
say
that
arbitrators
aren't
the
people
we
want
to
feel
we
have
empowered
to
award
punitive
damages
and
enforce
this
policy.
a
question
that
was
raised
earlier
with
regard
to
the
grounds
of
revoking
under
the
southland-keating
case,
the
court
recognized
that
in
addition
to
whether
it
is
a
contractor
involving
maritime
or
interstate
commerce,
you
could
lock
legitimately
at
any
grounds
that
exist
in
law
or
in
equity
to
revoke
the
contract
generally.
and
to
say
that
the
intertwining
was
a
ground
for
revoking
it
just
files
in
the
face
of
the
conduct,
because
once
a
court
finds
intertwining,
he
doesn't
revoke
the
arbitration.
he
says
it
can
go
forward,
but
in
my
discretion
i
will
either
let
it
go
forward
or
i
won't
let
it
go
forward.
he
doesn't
revoke
the
agreement
and
say
that
it
is
a
nullity.
so
that
argument
just
doesn't
seem
to
swing.
and
lastly,
with
regard
to
the
rebuttal
on
the
question
of
freely
bargained
for
contracts
and
the
provisions
in
the
contract,
i
have
examined
the
record
here.
there
isn't
one
scintilla
of
evidence
before
this
court
in
the
record
that
any
facts
were
considered
at
any
level
by
the
district
court
or
beyond
or
even
presented
by
dr.
byrd
that
this
contract
was
not
freely
negotiated,
that
he
had
any
doubts
about
the
contract,
or
that...
i
am
sorry.
thank
you.
