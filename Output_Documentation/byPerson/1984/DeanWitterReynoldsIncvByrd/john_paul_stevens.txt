justice
stevens
mr.
bell,
is
it
not
your
view,
though,
that
the
arbitration
should
await
the
federal
case?
justice
stevens
oh,
you
want
the
arbitration
to
proceed?
justice
stevens
we
must
have
misunderstood
one
another.
justice
stevens
you
say
the
federal
trial
should
go
first.
justice
stevens
yes,
that's
what
i
thought
your
position
was.
justice
stevens
mr.
bell,
you
suggested
earlier
that
there
would
be
no
res
judicata
or
estoppel
effect
of
the
arbitration...
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
the
arbitration
went
forward
and
there
were
judicial
enforcement
of
the
arbitrator's
award,
so
you
do
have
a
judicial
decree
determining
certain
rights?
justice
stevens
say
there
is
an
arbitration.
the
arbitrator
rules
for
one
party
or
the
other,
but
the
other
party
doesn't
accept
the
arbitration,
and
there
has
to
be
a
lawsuit
to
enforce
the
award,
and
then
the
court
enters
a
judgment,
presumably...
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court...
saying
pay
x
dollars
on
this
claim.
would
not
that
have
estoppel
effect?
justice
stevens
well,
there
could
be.
it
seems
to
me
there
could
be.
an
arbitrator
could
say,
i
think
the
basic
agreement
gave
the
agent
authority
to
make
all
these
trades,
and
therefore
i
am
ruling
in
favor
of
the
broker.
justice
stevens
and
that
judgment
could
say
the
same
thing.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
always
have
to
be.
justice
stevens
but
if
it
did
happen
that
way,
i
suppose
that
would
pretty
well
answer
that
issue,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
quick
question
before
you
do?
justice
stevens
under
your
view
of
the
seventh
circuit
position,
which
i
guess
is
the
same
one
you
take
in
this
case,
when
may
the
arbitration
go
forward,
after
all
appeals
have
been
completed
in
the
federal
trial,
or
after
the
trial?
justice
stevens
so
it
could
be
a
several
year
delay.
justice
stevens
it
would
not,
though,
i
take
it,
if
you
adopted
the
seventh
circuit
view.
justice
stevens
well,
that
impacts
on
the
pendent
claim,
but
if
he
has
the
right
to
choose,
how
does
it
impair
his
federal
claim,
because
he
can
go
forward
with
his
federal
claim
unimpaired
by
the
other
claim
under
the
seventh
circuit
view.
i
am
not
saying
it
is
the
right
view.
justice
stevens
well,
no,
because
the
arbitration
must
await
the
conclusion
of
the
federal
proceeding
in
order
to
protect
the
very
value
that
you
are
relying
on,
namely,
the
integrity
of
the
federal
claim.
justice
stevens
well,
the
impact
is,
he
may
have
something
he
prefers.
he
may
have
a
better
option,
is
what
you
are
saying.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you...
maybe
this
is
obvious,
but
i
am
just
trying
to
think
it
through.
is
it
correct
that
the
net
effect
of
the
intertwining
doctrine
in
your
position
is
that
whenever
a
district
judge
finds
intertwining,
that
the
arbitration
agreement
is
totally
unenforceable.
it
really
is
just
read
out
of
the
contract?
justice
stevens
which
are
pendent
to
the
federal
claim.
justice
stevens
your
argument
really
is
strongest
in
a
case
where
everything
would
be
tried
at
once,
presumably
where
you
get
total
intertwining
in
effect.
justice
stevens
the
net
effect,
though,
is
to
just
make
a
nullity
out
of,
a,
the
arbitration
agreement
itself,
and
b,
the
federal
policy
in
favor
of
arbitration.
justice
stevens
maybe
it
is
the
right
answer.
i
don't
know.
but
it
does
have
that
consequence.
justice
stevens
what
standard
would
guide
his
discretion
if
you
say
he
has
a
preoption
of
either
trying
it
all
in
one
ball
of
wax
or
saying,
well,
i
will
do
what
your
opponents
want?
is
there
any
standard
to
guide
him?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
having
found
that,
what
standard
then
guides
his
discretion?
justice
stevens
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
bell?
