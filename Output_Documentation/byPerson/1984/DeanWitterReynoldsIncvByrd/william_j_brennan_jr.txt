mr.
bell,
i
gather
you
risk
punitive
damages
in
the
federal
court,
suit,
don't
you?
justice
jr.
but
there
couldn't
be
any
in
the
arbitration,
could
there?
justice
jr.
i
take
it
if
these
state
court
suits
had
been
brought
in
state
court
here,
it
would
have
gone
to
arbitration,
would
it
not?
justice
jr.
so
then
you
are
sure
you
wouldn't
be
exposed
to
punitive
damages.
justice
jr.
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
your
desire
to
get
into
arbitration
rather
than
to
stay
in
the
federal
court?
justice
jr.
yes,
and
yet
you
would
still
say
that
the
arbitration
may
not
proceed
on
the
pendent
claims
that
have
been
rejected
by
the
district
court.
justice
jr.
i
agree
that
your
opponent's
position
is
not
exactly
clear,
but
at
one
point
in
his
argument
he
seemed
to
say
that
he
would
be
delighted
if
the
arbitration
could
go
forward.
justice
jr.
would
you
get
them
in
the
federal
courts
if
it
severed
the
state
law
claim?
justice
jr.
on
what
theory?
justice
jr.
no,
but
would
the
arbitration
agreement,
wouldn't
the
state
court
send
the
case
to
arbitration?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
where
you
get
punitive
damages.
justice
jr.
in
a
state
court?
could
those
state
law
claims
be
tried
in
the
state
law...
state
courts
in
light
of
the
arbitration
provision?
justice
jr.
mr.
bell,
i
am
still
a
little
confused.
if
the
state
law
claims
are
tried
in
federal
court,
do
you
agree
that
punitive
damages
may
be
awarded?
justice
jr.
how
about
this
case?
justice
jr.
but
in
the
state
claims?
justice
jr.
allow
punitive
damages--
justice
jr.
--for
the
state
claims
only.
justice
jr.
well,
now,
tell
me,
if
this
case
were
tried
in
california
state
courts,
if
those
state
claims
were
brought
there,
i
gather
there
could
be
no
punitive
damages,
could
there?
justice
jr.
that's
what
i
thought,
yes.
