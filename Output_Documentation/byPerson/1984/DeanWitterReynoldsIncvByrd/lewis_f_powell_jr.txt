mr.
benham,
do
you
agree
that
under
the
federal
act
you
would
not
be
entitled
to
punitive
damages?
justice
jr.
do
you
think
it
would
be
in
an
arbitration,
under
the
arbitration
contract
between
the
parties?
justice
jr.
yes,
so
you
would
have
to
try
the
cases
together
for
you
to
obtain
punitive
damages.
justice
jr.
but
coming
back
to
my
question,
if
the
claims
are
tried
together
on
pendent
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court,
the
federal
court
can
award
punitive
damages
on
the
state
law
claim.
justice
jr.
right.
doesn't
it
strike
you
as
somewhat
odd
that
you
should
be
able
to
bring
a
state
law
claim
as
a
pendent
claim
in
federal
court,
and
although,
if
it
were
tried
in
state
court
you
couldn't
get
punitive
damages
because
it
would
go
to
arbitration,
nonetheless
you
get
punitive
damages
in
federal
court?
