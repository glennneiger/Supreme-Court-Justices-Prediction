mr.
eric
v.
benham
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
respondent
in
this
case,
dr.
byrd,
sees
the
issue
before
the
court
as
being
whether
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
deny
arbitration
of
claims
which
are
otherwise
arbitrable
when
those
claims
are
factually
and
legally
intertwined
with
a
nonarbitrable
federal
securities
claim.
this
draws
into
question
the
scope
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
its
impact
on
federal
protective
legislation.
dr.
byrd
starts
from
the
premise
that
his
claim
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
is
not
arbitrable.
he
did
not
seek
arbitration
of
that
claim
in
the
district
court.
nevertheless,
the
issue
has
been
raised
by
the
securities
industry
association
in
their
amicus
brief.
in
wilco
versus
swan,
this
court
held
that
arbitration
of
claims
brought
under
the
securities
act
of
1933
could
not
be
impelled
to
be
arbitrated.
while
the
supreme
court
has
not
held...
ruled
on
whether
'34
act
claims
can
be
arbitrated,
every
court
of
appeal
which
has
addressed
the
question
has
found
that
the
logic
of
wilco
versus
swan
is
equally
applicable
to
claims
brought
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
recently
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
issued
a
rule
requiring
brokers
to
disclose
that
claims
brought
under
the
securities
statutes
are
not
subject
to
arbitration,
and
finding
that
the
failure
to
disclose
that
fact
is
deceptive
and
fraudulent.
consequently
this
case
concerns
only
the
arbitrability
of
the
pending
claims.
the
courts
of
appeal
which
have
addressed
this
issue
are
evenly
split.
the
sixth,
seventh,
and
eighth
circuits
have
held
that
the
district
court
has
no
discretion
retain
jurisdiction
over
pending
claims.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
it
certainly
would,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
however,
i
would
contend
it
is
not
before
the
court,
and
it
is
not
part
of
the
motion
that
was
made
in
the
district
court,
and
that
in
any
case
if
the
court
does
consider
that
issue,
that
it
should
determine
that
the
'34
act
claims
are
not
subject
to
arbitration
based
on
the
same
reasoning
as
the
court
applied
in
wilco
versus
swan.
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
which
have
held
that
the
district
courts
do
not
have
discretion
to
keep
the
pendent
claims
have
done
so
on
the
basis
of
finding
that
the
arbitration
act
compelled
severance
and
separate
arbitration
in
all
circumstances
without
regard
for
the
attendant
conditions
of
that
case.
the
fifth,
ninth,
and
eleventh
circuits,
however,
have
held
that
the
district
courts
have
discretion
to
retain
jurisdiction
of
the
entire
case
to
promote
the
protective
purposes
of
federal
protective
legislation
where
the
pending
claims
are
factually
and
legally
intertwined
with
the
federal
securities
claim.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
it
would
be
arbitrated,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
yes.
well,
it
depends
on
whether
the
arbitration
precedes
the
file
on
the
federal
securities
claim
or
whether
it
waits
until--
mr.
eric
v.
benham
--well,
if
it
occurs
first.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
the
petitioner
maintains
that
a
prior
arbitration
of
the
pending
claims
would
not
affect
the
federal
securities
claims,
but
every
court
of
appeal
which
has
considered
the
question,
including
those
which
have
opted
for
a
bifurcated
proceeding,
have
expressed
concern
over
the
effect
that
a
prior
arbitration
would
have.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
well,
it
would
take
from
the
district
court
its
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
securities
claim
by
deciding
the
issues
in
the
arbitral
forum.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
your
honor,
that
is
the
point
of
the
intertwining
exception.
it
is
not
all
pending
claims,
only
those
which
are
factually
and
legally
intertwined.
if
the
common
law
fraud
claim
is
decided
through
arbitration,
those
factual
findings
regarding
the
common
law
fraud
are
virtually
identical
to
those
which
will
be
decided
in
the
federal
securities
claim.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
no,
it
does
not.
however,
it
does
take
away
from
the
court
the
power
to
entertain
the
entire
question
dealing
with
the--
mr.
eric
v.
benham
--because,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
congressional
purpose
was
to
retain
for
federal
securities
claims
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
it
provides
an
additional
forum.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
well,
that's
true
in
the
'33--
mr.
eric
v.
benham
--from
the--
mr.
eric
v.
benham
--i
will
admit,
your
honor,
that
the
circumstances
are
not
identical.
however,
the
circumstances
are
substantially
similar,
and
are
part
of
the
legislative
program
to
provide
protection
for
investors.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
and
that
has
happened.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
i
don't
know
that
i
would,
your
honor.
under
section
3
of
the
arbitration
act,
it
requires
that
the
arbitration
proceed
first.
in
reality,
dean
witter
is
asking
for
an
exception
to
the
arbitration
act
to
have
the
trial
proceed
first.
however,
this
is
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge
as
to
whether
the
prior
arbitration
will
adversely
impact
the
federal
securities
claim.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
i
believe
that
is
true,
and
yet
that
was
not
their
motion.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
that
is
a
good
question,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
certainly,
and
this
court
also
has
reaffirmed
quite
recently
its
strong
support
of
resolving
disputes
through
arbitration.
nevertheless,
there
are
a
number
of
factors
which
in
this
case
do
not
make
arbitration
a
reasonable
way
to
resolve
the
problem.
first
of
all,
the
purpose
behind
arbitration
is
to
provide
a
more
efficient
and
quicker
resolution
of
the
dispute.
that
would
not
occur
in
this
case.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
your
honor,
in
any
case
there
will
still
be
a
bifurcated
proceeding.
first,
one
either--
mr.
eric
v.
benham
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
well,
the
arbitration
provision
provides
that
it
should
be...
shall
be
arbitrated
according
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
arbitrators
cannot
award
punitive
damages.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
well,
there
is
reason,
your
honor,
to
challenge
the
efficacy
of
the
choice
of
law
that
would
apply
in
arbitration
in
this
case,
but
if
new
york
law
is
applied,
it
is
true
that
punitive
damages
would
not
be
obtained.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
i
believe
we
would,
your
honor.
the
restrictions
only
as--
mr.
eric
v.
benham
--well,
the
only
restrictions,
not
on
the
federal
claim,
on
the
state
law
claims.
there
is
no
restriction
in
awarding
punitive
damages
to
the
state
law
claim.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
if
they
were
actually
brought
in
the
state
court?
mr.
eric
v.
benham
yes.
presumably
they
would.
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
your
question.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
well,
in
the
state
law
claims
brought,
as
long
as
they
are
tried
in
a
state...
in
a
court,
there
is
a
right
to
punitive
damages.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
unless
it
was
invalidated,
it
could
not.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not,
as
long
as
the
case
is
tried
in
any
court.
if
it
were
actually
tried
in
a
state
court
for
whatever
reason,
if
under
any
circumstances
the
arbitration
agreement
were
not
enforceable,
punitive
damages
could
be
obtained
under
the
state
law
claims.
it
is
only
in
arbitration,
and
only
in
arbitration
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
punitive
damages
cannot
be
obtained.
even
if
arbitration
is
held,
it
may
be
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
will
not
be
applied.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
i
could
find
no
authority
on
that.
presumably
they
would
be,
in
that
what
cases
have
dealt
with
the
issue
at
all
have
indicated
that
in
arbitration
the
parties
are
not
to
lose
any
right
they
would
have
in
court.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
well,
that
is
true.
however,
it
is
also...
the
purpose
is
not
to
take
away
legal
rights.
if
there
is
a
legal
right
to
punitive
damages
in
state
court,
it
should
also
be
available
in
arbitration.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
you
certainly
are.
despite
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
dickenson
versus
heinhold
securities,
the
federal
arbitration
act
does
not
expressly
require
a
bifurcation
and
separate
arbitration
in
a
mixed
claims
case.
the
question
is
whether
that
bifurcation
is
impliedly
required.
we
believe
that
an
examination
of
the
congressional
record
behind
the
arbitration
act
and
a
balancing
of
the
values
at
stake
indicate
that
arbitration
should
not
be
compelled.
it
was
recently
pointed
out
in
southland
corporation
versus
keating
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
indicates
a
limited
congressional
purpose,
to
remove...
impediments
to
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
agreements.
in
scherk
versus
alberto
culver
this
court
stated
that
the
purpose
was
"to
place
arbitration
agreements
on
the
same
footing
as
other
contracts.
"
and
in
primo
paint
corporation
versus
conklin
manufacturing
company
it
was
to
make
those
agreements
"as
enforceable
as
other
contracts
but
not
more
so.
"
now,
in
moses
h.
cone
versus
mercury
construction
company
and
southland
corporation
versus
keating,
this
court
has
expressed
a
strong...
confirmed
the
strong
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration
disputes,
but
a
policy
favoring
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements
does
not
require
arbitration
in
all
circumstances.
indeed,
section
2
of
the
arbitration
act
provides
for
judicial
exception.
section
2
states
that
arbitration
agreements
are
subject
to
revocation
on
such
grounds
as
exist
in
law
or
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
since
the
grounds
for
such
revocation
are
not
specified
in
the
act,
the
judiciary
may
create
such
exceptions
as
are
justified
so
long
as
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
congressional
purpose.
the
intertwining
doctrine
is
just
such
a
judicially
created
exception,
which
is
justified
by
three
factors.
first,
the
impact
of
bifurcation
on
the
federal
securities
claim,
the
additional
time
and
expense
of
prosecuting
two
separate
proceedings,
and
third,
the
adhesive
nature
of
this
arbitration
agreement.
in
wilco
versus
swan,
this
court
balanced
two
competing
values,
prompt
and
economical
resolution
of
disputes
through
arbitration
versus
promotion
of
effective
implementation
of
federal
protective
legislation.
in
that
case
the
promotion
of
the
federal
securities
protective
scheme
was
given
priority.
this
case
involves
the
same
values,
but
in
a
different
context.
bifurcation
and
separate
arbitration
will
impact
on
the
federal
securities
claim.
under
section
3
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
as
i
pointed
out
previously,
the
arbitration
must
proceed
first,
and
in
that
case,
as
we
have
discussed,
the
collateral
estoppel
effect
will
interfere
with
the
court's
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
securities
claim.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
if
you
adopt
the
seventh
circuit's
view,
we
would
contend
that
it
also
impacts
on
the
federal
securities
claim
in
a
more
subtle
way
in
that
it
puts
the
plaintiff
to
a
choice
as
to
whether
to
litigate
his
claim
in
two
separate
forums
or
whether
to
forego
either
the
federal
securities
claim
or
the
pending
claims.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
you
mean
that
because
of
the
delay
and
expense
of
prosecuting
two
separate
proceedings,
he
cannot
do
both?
mr.
eric
v.
benham
nevertheless,
it
is
possible
that
a
plaintiff
may
decide
to
forego
the
federal
securities
claim
and
proceed
only
on
the
state...
the
pending
claims
because
of
the
delay
and
expense
of
resolving
the
entire
matter.
inasmuch
as
the
federal
legislation
preserves
the
state
law
remedies
and
we
consider
that
as
part
of
the
scheme,
protective
scheme
that
the
state
law
remedies
are
preserved,
to
the
extent
that
the
plaintiff
is
put
to
a
choice
because
he
cannot
perhaps
afford
the
time
and
delay
and
expense
of
two
separate
proceedings,
then
he
must
make
a
choice,
and
it
has
an
impact
on
the
federal
securities
claim,
albeit
indirect.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
that
is
true.
dean
witter
claims
that
in
this
case
arbitration
is
a
value
which
is
entitled
to
priority,
but
severance
and
separate
arbitration
will
not
promote
prompt
and
economic
resolution
of
this
dispute.
rather,
dean
witter
seeks
arbitration
in
spite
of
it
causing
delay
in
efficiency
and
additional
expense.
petitioner
cites
numerous
cases
favoring
arbitration,
but
arbitration
has
been
favored
because
it
promotes
prompt
and
economical
resolution
of
disputes,
not
because
it
is
inherently
better.
in
bernhardt
versus
polygraphic
company
of
america,
this
court
recognized
the
shortcomings
of
arbitration,
limited
discovery,
absence
of
any
record
or
other
articulation
of
the
factual
or
legal
conclusions,
extremely
limited
right
of
review,
no
jury
trial,
no
rules
of
evidence.
despite
these
drawbacks,
the
benefits
of
arbitration
are
to
be
encouraged
where
they
have
been
freely
negotiated
for
by
parties
of
equal
bargaining
power.
in
both
wilco
and
bernhardt
this
court
acknowledged
the
importance
of
the
right
to
choose
a
judicial
forum
for
the
resolution
of
disputes.
that
right
should
not
be
considered
waived
in
advance
without
a
showing
that
such
waiver
was
knowing
and
intelligent.
ultimately,
the
only
value
promoted
by
requiring
a
severance
and
separate
arbitration
in
this
case
is
arbitration
itself.
dean
witter
relies
on
the
sanctity
of
its
contract
as
justification
for
compelling
arbitration,
but
this
is
not
a
contract
which
is
freely
negotiated
for
by
parties
of
equal
bargaining
power.
it
is
a
standard
form
contract
substantially
identical
in
its
terms
to
that
which
was
before
this
court
more
than
30
years
ago
in
wilco
versus
swan,
and
which
is
used
by
the
amici
curiae
and
others
throughout
the
securities
industry
in
their
customer
agreements.
dean
witter
correctly
points
cut
that
the
adhesive
nature
of
a
contract
does
not
automatically
make
it
unenforceable
under
california
law.
it
does,
however,
subject
that
agreement
to
special
scrutiny,
and
the
invalidation
of
provisions
which
are
not
within
the
reasonable
contemplation
of
the
parties.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
not
directly
whether
it
would
be
enforced.
however,
it
is
a
factor
relating
to
whether
the
district
judge
should
have
discretion
to
retain
jurisdiction
or
not.
the
only
justifications
for
arbitration
are
that
it
is
the
agreement
of
the
parties
or
that
it
is
more
efficient
and
economical.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
in
the
context
of
this
case,
neither
of
those
exist.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
yes,
your
honor,
i
guess
it
would
be.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
i
indicated
in
the
context
of
this
case
the
justifications
for
arbitration
are
not
present.
it
would
not
be
more
economical.
it
would
not
give
effect
to
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
and
it
could
adversely
affect
the
federal
securities
claim.
dean
witter
relies
on
this
court's
recent
decisions
in
moses
h.
cone
memorial
hospital
versus
mercury
construction
company
and
southland
corporation
versus
keating.
those
cases
reaffirm
the
strong
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration,
but
they
are
readily
distinguished
from
this
case.
neither
involve
federal
protective
legislation.
both
cases
involve
arbitration
provisions
which
were
prenegotiated
by
the
parties.
in
southland
versus
keating,
the
court
quoted
brayman
versus
zapata
offshore
company.
the
effect
of
the
agreement
was
made
at
arm's
length
by
parties
experienced
and
sophisticated.
finally,
in
moses
h.
cone
and
southland
the
benefits
of
arbitration
were
available
in
part,
in
southland
because
there
was
no
bifurcation,
and
in
moses
h.
cone
because
there
was
no
bifurcation
as
to
any
particular
defendant.
in
conclusion,
bifurcation
and
separate
arbitration
of
the
pending
claims
is
not
expressly
required,
and
is
counter
to
the
goals
of
the
arbitration
act.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
as
to
those
claims
which
are
legally
and
factually
intertwined.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
and
there
are
circumstances
where,
although
acknowledging
the
intertwining
doctrine,
certain
claims
were
nevertheless
sent
to
arbitration,
for
example
in
sibley
versus
tandy.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
yes.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
it
does
in
that
particular
circumstance.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
no,
he
would
have
the
discretion
to
entertain
them
or
not.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
that
is
all
we
are
asking
for,
your
honor,
is
that
the
district
judge
have
the
discretion
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
i
think
he
would
have
to
find
that
the
issues
were
factually
and
legally
intertwined.
mr.
eric
v.
benham
and
he--
mr.
eric
v.
benham
--whether
there
would
be
an
adverse
impact
on
the
federal
securities
claim
by
severing
the
claims
and
sending
them
to
arbitration.
bifurcation
and
separate
arbitration
is
not
expressly
required
and
is
counter
to
the
goals
of
the
arbitration
act.
it
may
adversely
affect
implementation
of
the
federal
securities
laws,
and
it
is
a
matter
which
is
not
freely
bargained
for
by
the
parties.
this
court
should
recognize
the
intertwining
doctrine
as
a
valid,
judicially
created
exception
to
the
requirements
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
it
should
approve
the
proper
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
judge
retaining
jurisdiction
of
the
entire
case,
and
it
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
