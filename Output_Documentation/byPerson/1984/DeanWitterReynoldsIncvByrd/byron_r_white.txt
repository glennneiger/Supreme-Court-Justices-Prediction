justice
white
of
course,
your
position
really
evaporates,
i
suppose,
if
wilco
doesn't
apply
to
this
case.
justice
white
don't
you
have
to
address
that?
justice
white
okay.
i
thought
that
might
be...
you
can
take
your
own
order.
justice
white
yes,
sir.
justice
white
you
are
really
walking
a...
going
up
one
side
of
the
street
and
down
the
other.
you
want
the
arbitration...
you
want
the
right
to
arbitrate
certain
of
these
provisions,
but
then
you
want
to
delay
arbitration.
justice
white
and
you
want
to
wait
until...
delay
the
arbitration,
one
of
the
purposes
of
which
is
speed
and
economy.
you
want
to
delay
that
until
maybe
three
or
four
years
later
you
finish
a
securities
act
trial.
justice
white
no,
but
that
is
what--
justice
white
--that
is
what
your
motions
were
aimed
at.
justice
white
well,
you
are
stuck
with
the
wilco
case
basically.
justice
white
well,
without
it...
you
are
stuck
with
it.
without
it,
you
are--
justice
white
--well,
i
know,
but
you
wouldn't
be...
you
would
be
arbitrating
everything--
justice
white
--including
the
securities
act
claim.
justice
white
which
you
don't
want
to
do.
or
do
you?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
well,
congress
said
wilco
is
based
on
the
fact
that
congress
had
provided--
justice
white
--all
the
courts
of
appeals
have--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
well,
normally,
even
if
there
is
an
intertwining,
so
to
speak,
the
federal
district
court
isn't
required
to
entertain
the
pendent
claims,
is
it?
justice
white
normally,
yes.
what
if
in
a
case
like
this
the
district
court
just
said,
well,
i
am
just
not
going
to
entertain
the
pendent
claims,
we
will
just
try
the
securities
act
claim.
what
would
then
happen
to
the
pendent
claim?
it
would
be
arbitrated,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
quickly,
too.
justice
white
well,
why
should
it
wait?
why
should
it
wait?
justice
white
i
would
guess
an
arbitration
proceeding
could
nine
times
out
of
ten
proceed
and
be
concluded
before
the
securities
trial
is
even
well
under
way.
justice
white
what
would
be
wrong
with
that?
justice
white
well,
it
wouldn't
be
trying
a
federal
issue.
it
would
be
trying...
the
only
thing
that
would
be
preclusive
would
be
findings
of
fact
that
are...
been
litigated.
justice
white
you
can't
say
that
in
this
case.
congress
didn't
say
a
word
about
trying
a
10(b)
claim
like
this.
justice
white
well,
how
can
you
say
what
the
congressional
intention
was
then?
justice
white
like
you
could
in
wilco.
justice
white
don't
you
think
it
is
odd
to
say
that
pendent
claims
need
not
be
entertained
by
a
district
court,
and
you
have
to
go
on
and
say,
and
they
can't
be...
and
yet
they
can't
be
tried
out
until
some
other
case
is
tried?
i
think
that
is
very
odd.
justice
white
well,
i
know
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge,
but
say
he
says,
i
exercise
my
discretion
not
to
entertain
these
pendent
claims.
justice
white
you
would
oppose
the
arbitration
going
forward,
however,
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
interfere
with
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
if
the
district
judge
found
intertwining,
he
necessarily
would
entertain
the
pendent
claims
rather
than
exercise
his
discretion
not
to?
justice
white
even
though
he
found
them
intertwining?
justice
white
well,
he
should
never
find
intertwining
if
he
is
going
to
not
entertain
it.
he
wouldn't
have
to
find
it.
he
wouldn't
have
to
go
to
all
that
trouble.
