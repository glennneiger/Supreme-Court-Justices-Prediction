mr.

justice
o'connor
--do
you
think
we
should
assume
that
a
prior
arbitration
of
the
state
law
claims
would
have
preclusive
effect
in
a
subsequent
federal
trial
involving
the
same
issues?
justice
o'connor
so
in
your
view,
at
least,
the
prior
arbitration
of
the
state
claims
would
not
have
preclusive
effect?
justice
o'connor
apart
from
the
wilco
question,
mr.
bell,
if
the
prior
arbitration
of
the
state
law
claims
would
not
have
preclusive
effect
in
the
handling
of
the
federal
securities
act
litigation,
then
why
should
the
district
court
have
to
stay
the
arbitration?
