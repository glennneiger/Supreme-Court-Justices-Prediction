mr.
lee,
may
i
ask--
justice
stevens
--what
happened
after
the
events
you
have
just
described?
justice
stevens
then
what
happened?
justice
stevens
what
did
they
do
with
the
suitcases
at
that
time?
did
they
take
them
to
the
police
department,
too?
justice
stevens
so
they
kept
all
the
stuff
together,
and
took
it
down
to
the
department
at
the
time
they
arrested
them?
justice
stevens
so
at
the
time
they
made
the
searches,
would
they
have
had
sufficient
probable
cause
to
do
all
that
without
opening
the
suitcases?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
and
to
take
the
suitcases
to
the
police
station?
justice
stevens
as
they
did
later?
justice
stevens
mr.
lee,
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
facts?
justice
stevens
in
addition
to
searching
the
suitcases
and
the
bandaid
box
in
this
case,
how
extensive
was
the
search
of
the
vehicle.
did
they
tear
open
the
upholstery
and
things
of
that
kind?
justice
stevens
was
there
anything
found
any
place
except
in
these
various
containers?
justice
stevens
what
would
your
view
be
if
they
had
brought
all
these
things
out
and
set
them
down
right
beside
the
vehicle,
and
the
officer
then
accosted
them?
would
you
agree
that
they
could
not
have
opened
them
and
had
to
wait
until
they
at
least
put
them
in
the
vehicle?
justice
stevens
i
just
wondered
what
your
view
is
in
your
submission
to
the
court
in
connection
with
this.
is
it
critical
to
your
case
that
these
materials
had
first
been
placed
into
the
vehicle
before
the
search
began?
justice
stevens
and
would
you
therefore
concede
that
under
chadwick
and
sanders,
had
they
not
been
placed
in
the
vehicle,
they
could
not
have
been
opened
and
searched?
justice
stevens
well,
suitcases
which
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
contained
a
lot
of
drugs.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
stick
with
my
hypothetical
for
a
minute,
where
they
put
everything
down
before
they
throw
anything
into
the
car.
could
they
have
then
searched
the
car,
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
the
justification
for
searching
the
car
rests
entirely
on
placing
these
containers
in
the
car?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
from
sanders?
justice
stevens
you
just
agreed
that
was
true
here
also.
justice
stevens
mr.
lee,
may
i
just
refresh
my
recollection?
i
think
you
also
said
that
before
anything
was
put
in
the
car...
and
of
course
until
the
suitcases
were
put
in
the
trunk
there
was
no
odor
of
marijuana
from
the
trunk,
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
there
was
no
testimony
there
was...
before
they
put
anything
into
the
car
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
search
the
car.
justice
stevens
i
asked
both
sides,
and
i
think
you
are
entirely
consistent
in
your
answer.
mr.
lee,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
whether
the
smell
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
car
had
any
independent
source
other
than
the
suitcases?
justice
stevens
then
you
don't
agree
with
the
oklahoma
court
of
appeals'
analysis
of
the
case?
justice
stevens
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
don't
you
concede
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
suitcases?
justice
stevens
okay.
i
am
wondering
whether
there
wasn't
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
vehicle,
given
the
information
the
officer
had
and
the
fact
that
the
defendants
who
were
suspected
on
the
basis
of
the
tip
of
dealing
in
narcotics
had
been
loading
the
vehicle
and
on
the
sight
of
one
of
the
defendants
tossing
a
package
inside
the
car
and
trying
to
lock
it
and
trying
to
put
evidence
out
of
the
way.
did
that
give
rise
to
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
vehicle?
justice
stevens
mr.
cox,
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
officer,
taylor,
i
guess
his
name
was,
was
in
uniform
or
not?
justice
stevens
was
he
or
wasn't
he
then?
justice
stevens
was
he
in
uniform?
justice
stevens
i
thought
your
brief
indicated
to
the
contrary.
