justice
marshall
but...
closeness
to
a
gun,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
on
whichever
side,
once
he
smelled
the
marijuana
in
the
back
of
the
car,
it
is
your
theory
that
he
should
have
gone
for
a
search
warrant?
justice
marshall
how
long
would
it
have
taken
him
to
get
the
search
warrant,
about?
justice
marshall
and
where
do
you
think
that
car
would
be
in
that
hour?
a
thunderbird?
justice
marshall
oh,
he
is
going
to
leave
it
right
there?
