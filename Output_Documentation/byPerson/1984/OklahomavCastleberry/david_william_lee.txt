mr.
david
william
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issues
in
this
case
which
primarily
arise
under
the
principles
announced
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
ross
are
as
follows:
first,
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
defendants'
vehicle
in
this
case
contained
contraband,
and
secondly,
assuming
there
was
such
probable
cause,
whether
the
police
acted
properly
in
searching
without
a
search
warrant
three
suitcases
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
and
the
bandaid
box
which
was
found
on
the
dashboard
of
the
car.
of
course,
the
state
contends
that
the
answer
to
these
questions
is
in
the
affirmative.
the
facts
in
the
present
case
are
that
at
noon
on
the
day
in
question,
officer
taylor,
a
narcotics
officer
with
the
oklahoma
city
police
department,
received
a
telephone
call
from
a
confidential
informant.
the
informant
stated
that
he
had
been
within
the
room
in
question,
room
113,
within
the
last
ten
hours
and
had
observed
a
large
quantity
of
marijuana,
some
cocaine,
and
some
other
white
pills.
the
informant
stated
that
some
of
the
drugs
in
question
were
in
a
blue
suitcase.
the
informant
gave
the
officer
a
description
of
the
men
that
were
in
the
room.
the
informant
also
stated
that
one
of
the
names
of
the
men
who
were
in
the
room
was
named
tim
castleberry,
and
that
the
other
man
was
named
nick.
the
informant
stated
that
these
men
were
driving
a
blue
1980
or
'81
thunderbird
with
florida
license
plates.
officer
taylor
took
this
information
and
immediately
proceeded
to
the
motel
in
question,
which
is
located
on
an
interstate
highway
in
oklahoma
city--
mr.
david
william
lee
--yes,
your
honor,
the
informant
specifically
told
the
officer
that
some
of
the
narcotics
was
in
a
blue
suitcase
which
was...
which
the
informant
stated
that
he
had
observed
in
the
last
ten
hours.
officer
taylor
drove
to
the
motel,
went
in,
and
drove
through
the
parking
lot
and
observed
parked
in
front
of
room
113,
the
room
which
the
informant
had
referred
to,
he
noticed
parked
immediately
in
front
of
the
room
a
blue
1980
or
'81
thunderbird
with
florida
license
plates.
taylor
parked
his
car,
went
in,
and
found
out
from
the
room
clerk
that
the
room
was
registered
to
tim
castleberry,
which
is
the
name
of
the
person
referred
to
by
the
informant.
he
said
castleberry
had
paid
for
only
the
previous
night,
and
that
checkout
time
was
at
1:00
p.m.,
and
that
he
would
be
leaving
at
1:00
p.m.
at
this
time,
it
was
approximately
ten
minutes
until
l:
00
o'clock.
the
officer
then
returned
to
the
car,
which
was
approximately
five
space
away
from
the
blue
thunderbird,
and
called
for
a
backup.
while
waiting
there
for
his
backup
to
arrive,
he
observed
the
defendant
castleberry
come
from
room
113
carrying
a
blue
suitcase
which
matched
the
description
of
the
one
given
to
him
by
the
informant
which
stated
that
some
of
the
narcotics
were
in
that
particular
suitcase.
taylor
watched
him
put
the
blue
suitcase
in
the
trunk
of
the
thunderbird.
he
then
saw
the
defendant
raineri
also
leave
room
113
carrying
two
green
plaid
suitcases,
which
he
also
observed
him
place
these
in
the
trunk
of
the
car.
he
then
observed
castleberry
come
out
of
the
room
a
second
time
and
place
a
blue
suitcase
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car
behind
the
driver's
side.
at
this
time
officer
taylor
felt
like
he
needed
to
take
action.
he
got
out
of
the
car.
he
drew
his
gun.
he
approached
the
two
men.
he
advised
them
he
was
an
oklahoma
city
police
officer.
he
stated
that...
he
had
his
badge
displayed
and
his
gun
pulled.
he
asked
both
men
to
place
their
hands
on
the
car.
it
should
be
noted
that
there
was
a
third
person
come
out
of
the
room
who
at
this
time
stated,
"i
am
not
involved
in
any
of
this.
"
"i
am
scared.
"
"i
am
not
any
good
at
this.
"
in
response
to
the
request
by
the
officer...
and
i
need
to
add
that
officer
taylor
testified
that
as
he
approached
the
trunk
of
the
car,
he
was
able
to
detect
a
strong
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk
of
the
car,
which
was
open.
he
said
after
he
gave
his
command,
castleberry,
who
was
standing
on
the
driver's
side
of
the
car,
near
the
trunk,
slammed
the
trunk
shut.
he
said
that
the
defendant
raineri,
who
was
standing
on
the
passenger
side
of
the
car,
immediately
complied
with
the
request,
but
castleberry,
after
slamming
the
trunk
shut,
stepped
back
further
toward
the
driver's
side
and
placed
his
hands
behind
his
back.
the
officer
testified
that
he
gave
castleberry
two
more
commands
to
put
his
hands
on
the
car,
and
castleberry
refused,
and
finally
threw
an
object
into
the
car.
officer
taylor
approached
and
attempted
to
force
him
to
place
his
hands
on
the
car.
a
certain
amount
of
wrestling
ensued,
and
they
both
went
to
the
ground
while
officer
taylor
was
trying
to
subdue
castleberry.
during
this
time,
castleberry
was
able
to
reach
up,
lock
the
inside
of
the
driver's
car,
and
slam
the
door
shut.
the
car
keys
to
the
car
were
at
this
time
in
the
door
on
the
driver's
side
of
the
car
where
the
two
men
were.
at
this
time
the
backup,
officer
citty
of
the
oklahoma
city
police
department
arrived.
he
stated
and
it
was
the
testimony
of
both
these
men
that
he
came
up,
that
he
was
given
the
keys
to
the
car
by
officer
taylor,
and
advised
by
officer
taylor
that
he
had
smelled
an
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk.
he
took
the
keys,
opened
the
trunk.
he,
too,
said
he
smelled
an
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk.
he
unzipped
the
two
plaid
suitcases
that
the
defendant
raineri
had
taken
from
the
room
and
placed
in
the
car,
and
he
found
there
a
large
amount
of
marijuana.
there
were
25
pounds
of
marijuana
in
one
of
the
suitcases
and
34
pounds
of
marijuana
in
the
other.
he
then
proceeded
to...
he
had
to
forcefully
open
the
blue
suitcase
that
the
defendant
raineri
had...
defendant
castleberry
had
brought
from
the
room
and
placed
in
the
car
first.
he
forcefully
opened
that,
and
in
that
suitcase
was
found
$2,700
in
cash
and
approximately
ten
ounces
of
methaqualone.
the
state
contends,
of
course,
that
the
search
of
these
four
containers,
the
three
suitcases
which
were
found
in
the
trunk
and
the
bandaid
box
on
the
dashboard,
were
properly
conducted
without
a
warrant.
mr.
david
william
lee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
william
lee
they
stated
that...
their
testimony
was
that
when
they...
after
they
found
the
money,
the
items
were
taken
inside
the
motel
room,
and
it
was
in
the
motel
room
that
they
found
that...
they
counted
$2,700
and
found
the
methaqualone.
mr.
david
william
lee
then
they
arrested
the
defendants
and
they
took
them
to
the
police
department.
they
testified--
mr.
david
william
lee
--i
believe
they
did.
mr.
david
william
lee
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
william
lee
at
the
time
they
made
the
search?
mr.
david
william
lee
to
arrest
the
defendants?
mr.
david
william
lee
i
believe,
based
particularly
on
the
information
given
by
the
informant,
and
particularly
when
officer
taylor
approached
the
car
and
detected
the
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk
of
the
car,
certainly
they
would
have
had
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest.
mr.
david
william
lee
yes.
mr.
david
william
lee
yes,
as
they
did.
mr.
david
william
lee
yes,
the
car
could
have
all
been
taken,
and
the
officers
testified
that
they
made
an
inventory
search
of
the
car
at
the
police
department.
mr.
david
william
lee
that
is
not
mentioned
in
the
record.
i
presume
there
was
nothing
found
in
that.
the
record
doesn't
even
reflect
whether
it
was
searched.
mr.
david
william
lee
excuse
me.
i
forgot
the
part
that
officer
citty
stated
that
after
he
found
the
items
in
the
suitcases,
that
he
then
looked
in
the
interior
of
the
car,
found
the
bandaid
box,
and
it
was
located
on
the
dashboard
of
the
car.
he
opened
it,
and
found
an
ounce
of
cocaine.
we
contend
that
the
search
of
the
suitcases
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
and
the
bandaid
box
which
was
found
inside
the
car
were
all
properly
searched
pursuant
to
the
principles
announced
by
this
court
in
the
ross
case
and--
mr.
david
william
lee
--yes,
we
think
that
that--
mr.
david
william
lee
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
william
lee
it
is
the
bandaid
box.
we
think
that
the
suitcases
and
the
bandaid
box
were
all
searched
pursuant
to
the
automobile
exception
rule
in
ross
and
of
course
the
more
recent
case
announced
by
this
court,
united
states
versus
johns.
we
also
feel
that
the
bandaid
box
was
properly
searched
as
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
custodial
arrest
under
the
doctrines
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
robinson
and
new
york
versus
belton.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
vehicle
in
question
contained
contraband,
and
that
a
search
of
the
entire
vehicle
for
drugs
was
justified
by
the
facts.
the
fact
that
checkout
time
was
at
hand,
that
the
baggage
had
been
loaded
into
the
car,
that
the
informant
had
stated
that
some...
that
one
of
the
suitcases
contained
drugs,
that
a
strong
odor
of
marijuana
was
coming
from
the
trunk,
coupled
with
the
actions
of
the
defendant
castleberry
and
the
third
party
as
officer
taylor
approached
the
car,
all
support
the
belief
that
the
drugs
had
been
removed
from
somewhere
in
the
motel
room
and
were
now
somewhere
in
the
vehicle.
therefore,
the
entire
automobile
could
have
been
a
hideaway
for
the
drugs.
this
court
specifically
held
in
the
johns
case
that
when
the
officers
approached
the
trucks
in
question
and
detected
the
distinct
odor
of
marijuana
which
was
around
the
back
of
the
truck,
they
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
truck.
the
court
in
johns
stated
also
that
the
officers
in
the
ross
case
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
vehicle
in
that
case.
the
state
believes
that
the
facts
in
this
case
present
an
even
more
compelling
case
involving
probable
cause.
in
this
case,
the
convictions
of
the
defendant
were
reversed
by
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
a
two-to-one
decision.
the
court
stated
the
reason
why
they
reversed
was
because
they
felt
like
if
an
officer
had
tried
to
apply
the
ross
and
the
sanders
and
the
chadwick
doctrine,
they
felt
like
that
taking
all
those
cases
together,
that
if
an
officer
knows
of
the
specific
location
within
a
vehicle
where
contraband
is
located,
the
officer
should
get
a
search
warrant.
however,
if
he
only
knows
that
there
is
contraband
generally
in
the
vehicle,
the
officer
can
go
ahead
and
search
it
without
a
warrant.
the
court
held
in
this
case
since
the
suitcases
and
the
bandaid
box
were
suspected
locations
of
contraband,
they
should
have
been
detained
while
the
search
warrant
was
being
obtained.
however,
in
the
johns
case,
the
court
observed
that
when
the
officers
detected
the
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
back
of
the
trucks,
they
no
doubt
suspected
that
the
odor
was
coming
from
the
packages
which
were
in
the
back
of
the
truck,
but
the
court,
of
course,
in
that
case
did
not
require
a
search
warrant.
in
ross,
the
police
were
advised
of
the
specific
location
of
drugs
in
that
case.
in
that
case
they
were
advised
by
an
informant
that
the
drugs
were
in
the
trunk,
but
this
court
upheld
the
search
of
the
brown
paper
bag
and
the
zippered
pouch
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
without
requiring
a
search
warrant.
under
the
same
rationale,
the
search
of
the
suitcases
found
in
the
trunk
in
the
present
case
should
be
upheld.
the
rule
announced
by
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
we
feel
means
that
there
would
now
be
endless
litigation
over
whether
or
not
the
police
suspected
of
a
particular
location
of
contraband
within
a
particular
container
in
a
vehicle.
furthermore,
this
court
in
johns
specifically
noted
that
the
fact
that
a
container
is
involved
does
not
in
itself
either
expand
or
contract
the
well-established
exception
to
the
warrant
principle
recognized
in
the
carroll
case.
in
ross
this
court
stated
that
there
was
no
distinction
between
containers
and
compartments,
and
that
the
object
of
the
search
is
limited...
and
that
the
officer's
search
is
limited
only
by
the
object
of
the
search,
and
the
places
in
which
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
object
may
be
found.
in
both
ross
and
johns
and
in
justice
powell's
concurring
opinion
in
the
robins
case
it
was
noted
that
in
neither
sanders
nor
in
the
chadwick
case
did
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
vehicle
or
anything
in
it
other
than
the
footlocker
in
the
chadwick
case
and
the
suitcase
in
the
sanders
case.
mr.
david
william
lee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
william
lee
there
is
no
record
of
that.
of
course,
we
think
that
on
the
basis
of
the
carroll
search,
where,
as
you
pointed
out
in
the
ross
case,
the
police
ripped
open
the
upholstery
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car,
that
that
would
have
been
proper,
but
there
is
no
record
there
was
anything
like
that
done.
the
suitcase
in
the
trunk
was
forceably
opened.
mr.
david
william
lee
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
really
four
containers
where
something
was
found,
three
suitcases
in
the
trunk
and
the
bandaid
box
found
on
the
dashboard.
mr.
david
william
lee
that
is
a
question
that
is
going
to
fall
somewhere
between
the
cases
of
this
court,
in
the
place
case,
and
the
mendenhall,
and
the
jacobson
case,
where--
mr.
david
william
lee
--yes,
i
think
the
fact
that
it
was
placed
into
an
automobile
is
the
critical
distinction
there.
mr.
david
william
lee
yes.
yes,
i
think
that
if
the
officer
had
known
nothing
more
than
these
were
individuals
who
were
carrying
suitcases,
the
airport
cases,
that
kind
of
thing
would
apply.
mr.
david
william
lee
yes,
i
think
the
court
made
clear
in
place
that
they
have
got
to
get
a
search
warrant.
however,
when
they
were
placed
into
the
car,
that
coupled
with
the
fact
that
when
they
approached
the
rear
end
of
the
car
the
officer
detected
a
strong
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk,
that
changes--
mr.
david
william
lee
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
because--
mr.
david
william
lee
--yes.
all
the
facts
in
this
situation
show
that
there
were
drugs
in
the
motel
room
parked
on
the
interstate
highway
in
oklahoma,
in
a
room.
all
the
facts
that
were
observed
by
the
officer
showed
that
the
drugs
were
being
moved
from
the
room
to
somewhere
in
the
car.
the
informant
made
his
observations
within
the
last
ten
hours.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
there
was
at
least
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
individuals
with
those
drugs
were
going
to
place
them
from
the
motel
room
that
they
were
just
checking
out
of
into
the
car.
that
is
why
we
think
it
is
an
automobile
case.
mr.
david
william
lee
in
sanders
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
drugs
were
in
any
other
place
other
than
the
suitcase
which
the
police
had
surveilled
and
watched
them
place--
mr.
david
william
lee
--no,
i
think
we
have
a
lot
more
in
sanders.
i
think
we
have
a
situation
where
the
individuals
could
have
removed
the
drugs
from
the
room
to
the
car
any
time
within
the
last
ten
hours.
mr.
david
william
lee
well,
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
am
saying
if
the
officer
had
come
up
and
observed
nothing
more
than
individuals
with
the
suitcases,
and
that
was--
mr.
david
william
lee
--it
is
possible,
but
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
officer
observed
the
individuals
place
four
containers
in
the
car.
mr.
david
william
lee
well,
plus
the
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk
of
the
car,
plus
the
actions
of
the
defendant
castleberry
and
the
third
party
as
the
officers
approached
the
car.
mr.
david
william
lee
well,
i
am
saying
that...
and
i
believe
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
was,
if
the
only
thing
he
would
have
known
was,
he
pulls
up
and
sees
castleberry
with
a
suitcase
getting
ready
to
get
into
the
car,
i
am
saying
that
would
probably
fall
more
into
the
place,
and
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
the
jacobson
situation.
here
we
have
much
more.
we
have
him
putting
four
suitcases
in
the
car,
one
of
which
the
informant
had
specifically
told
him
within
the
last
ten
hours
he
had
seen
narcotics
in
the
suitcase.
we
have
him
approaching
the
car,
detecting
a
strong
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk,
which
i
think
puts
it
right
on
point
with
the
johns
case,
where
the
officers
approached
the
trucks
and
detected
the
odor
of
marijuana,
and
the
court
in
that
case
said
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
trucks
everywhere,
and
the
court
specifically
stated
that
contraband
could
have
been
concealed
anywhere
in
the
trucks.
mr.
david
william
lee
certainly
resistance
generally
reflects
a
consciousness
of
guilt,
and
we
think
that
the
actions
of
castleberry...
we
don't
think
a
law
abiding
citizen
who
was
not
doing
anything
would
react
this
way
when
he
was
approached
by
a
police
officer.
we
think
the
fact
that
at
gunpoint
he
refused
two
commands
to
place
his
hands
on
the
car,
that
he
finally
threw
the
item,
the
bandaid
box
in
the
car,
that
he
struggled
with
the
police
officer,
that
he
locked
the
car
and
slammed
the
door
shut
during
the
process
of
this,
he
obviously
didn't
want
the
police
to
get
the
bandaid
box,
and
he
obviously
didn't
want
them
to
get
in
the
car.
he
didn't
want
them
to
get
in
the
trunk
of
the
car,
too,
because
the
actions
of
castleberry
in
slamming
the
trunk
shut
as
he
approached,
as
the
officer
approached
the
car,
should
also
be
considered,
i
think,
to
be
a
probable
cause
fact.
so
here
we
have
much
more
than
just
an
individual
who
happens
to
be
standing
on
a
curb
with
a
suitcase
next
to
a
car.
here
we
have
all
these
facts
which
i
think
and
which
we
contend
places
it
clearly
within
the
johns
situation.
mr.
david
william
lee
if
they
had
not
been
placed
inside
the
car,
and
if
there
had
not
been
a
detecting
odor
of
marijuana
by
the
officer--
mr.
david
william
lee
--i
think
that
your
decision
in
the
johns
case
would
allow
them
to
search
the
entire
vehicle,
because
in
that
case
all
they
had
was
a
situation
50
miles
from
the
mexican
border
where
there
was
a
plane
that
landed,
and
trucks
pull
up
to
the
plane,
and
then
as
the
officers
approach
the
trucks,
they
stated
that
they
detected
the
odor
of
marijuana,
and
then
your
holding
in
that
case
was
that
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
search.
well,
they
also
observed
packages
in
the
back
of
the
truck,
but
you
stated
all
these
facts
together
said
there
was
probable
cause
to
make
a
search.
so,
i
think,
yes,
the
odor
of
marijuana
is
a
very
critical
fact,
but
in
this
case
we
have
much
more
we
feel
like
than
the
officers
did
in
the
johns
case.
mr.
david
william
lee
in
response
to
his
hypothetical,
if
the
police
had
had
nothing
more
than
if
they
had
arrived
at
that
motel
and
seen
castleberry
with
the
suitcases,
and
he
had
not
placed
the
suitcases
in
the
car,
and
he
had
not
taken
any
evasive
action,
and
they
had
not
detected
the
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk,
i
think
this
case
would
require
them
to
get
a
search
warrant
for
the
suitcase,
just
as
though
they
are
always
required
to
get
a
search
warrant
any
time
there
is
a
handbag
or
suitcase
at
an
airport,
like
in
the
place
case.
i
think
that
all
those
facts
move
it
completely
into
the
automobile
exception
case,
all
those
additional
factors.
the
fact
that
he
saw
him
loading
four
suitcases
into
the
car,
the
fact
that
it
was
checkout
time,
the
fact
that
there
was
marijuana
odor
coming
from
the
trunk.
mr.
david
william
lee
that's
correct.
yes.
i
may
have
misunderstood
you.
i
am
sorry.
i
thought
you
asked
if
they
could
search
the
suitcases.
mr.
david
william
lee
no,
your
honor,
officer
taylor
just
testified
that
he
detected
a
strong
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk.
he
didn't
specify
whether
he
could
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
coming
from
a
particular
package
or
not.
mr.
david
william
lee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
william
lee
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
stated
that
he
detected
an
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk
of
the
car.
this
was
after
the
three
suitcases
had
been
placed
in
the
trunk,
but
it
is
unclear
whether
he
was...
he
probably
wasn't
able
to
detect,
be
able
to
specify
which
of
the
suitcases
the
odor
of
marijuana
came
from.
mr.
david
william
lee
no,
i
think
this
falls
flat
within
the
holding
of
ross,
your
honor.
mr.
david
william
lee
no,
i
think
that
the
case
of
ross
controls
this
case,
and
it
is
reaffirmed
by
what
this
court
said
in
the
johns
case.
mr.
david
william
lee
i
think
that
they
control
this.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
expand
them
or
anything.
i
think
that
the
officer
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
somewhere
in
this
vehicle,
in
one
of
more
than
four--
mr.
david
william
lee
--well,
i
think
that
it
is
right
on
point
with
ross,
your
honor,
and
johns.
i
think
you
have
a
situation
in
ross
where
the
informant
told
the
police
that
the
individual
was
selling
drugs
out
of
the
trunk,
and
the
court
in
johns
and
in
ross
said
that
when
the
officers
opened
the
trunk
and
saw
the
brown
paper
bag
and
the
zippered
pouch,
they
had
probable
cause
to
search
both
those
containers,
and
then
the
court
came
along
in
johns
and
said
they
could
have
searched
the
entire
car,
and
i
think
ross
also
said
that,
too,
although
maybe
not
as
directly
as
the
court
did
in
johns.
i
think
clearly
in
our
case
we
have
much
more
than
the
police
officer
did
in
ross
to
believe
that
the
trunk--
mr.
david
william
lee
--no,
your
honor.
i
may
have
misspoke
myself.
i
believe--
mr.
david
william
lee
--the
fact
is
that
the
officer
suspected
of
locations
of
contraband
does
not
mean
that
they
should
be...
that
there
is
not
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
contraband
outside
those
suitcases.
besides,
the
police
were--
mr.
david
william
lee
--yes,
i
was
assuming
there
was
nothing
more
other
than
the
suitcases
being
outside.
mr.
david
william
lee
with
or
without
the
smell
of
marijuana,
your
honor?
i
think
the
small
of
marijuana
is
critical
to
our
case,
too.
i
think
that
if
the
officer
had
pulled
up
and
seen
nothing
more
than
castleberry--
mr.
david
william
lee
--i
think
there
is
still
probable
cause
to
search
the
car,
based
on
the
odor
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk
of
the
car,
your
honor.
i
think
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
johns
case,
and
should
be
the
holding
here.
i
don't
think
there's
any
distinction.
mr.
david
william
lee
the
officer
would
not
have
known
specifically
which
container
contained
the
marijuana.
the
officer
had
only
information
that
he
had
been
told
the
blue
suitcase
contained
some
of
the
narcotics,
which
i
take
to
mean
that
some
of
the
other
narcotics
were
moved
from
somewhere
in
the
motel
room
to...
placed
somewhere
in
the
car.
i
mean,
the
car
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
criminal
process
in
this
case.
this
is
a
car
with
florida
license
plates.
it
was
checking
out
of
a
motel
on
an
interstate
highway,
a
major
interstate
highway
in
oklahoma.
drugs
were
removed
from
the
motel
room
to
somewhere
in
the
car.
the
police
suspect
the
location
of
some
of
those
drugs.
mr.
david
william
lee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
william
lee
well,
of
course,
the
question--
mr.
david
william
lee
--in
ross
is,
you
balance
the
privacy
interests
of
the
individual
versus
the
administrative
inconvenience
to
the
police
in
getting
a
warrant.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
police,
i
presume,
would
have
been
required
to
get
a
warrant
for
five
different
containers
plus
any
other,
as
justice
powell
in
the
robbins
case
said,
any
other
trivial
containers.
there
could
have
been
a
beer
can,
a
crumpled
up
cigarette
pack
in
the
car,
a
wastebasket,
a
rolled
up
floormat,
any
other
container
they
would
have
had
to
get
a
search
warrant
for.
we
think
that
in
ross
the
court
made
it
clear
that
they
are
not
required
to
take
all
these
containers
out
of
the
car,
try
and
guard
them
and
safeguard
them,
and
get
a
search
warrant
for
who
knows
how
many
containers
might
be
in
a
car.
mr.
david
william
lee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
william
lee
no,
your
honor.
i
am
attempting
to
do
what
the
court
did
in
the
johns
case,
distinguish
chadwick
and
sanders.
mr.
david
william
lee
well,
i
think
if
there
was
a
situation
where
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
contraband
could
have
been
anywhere
other
than
in
the
suitcases,
and
the
suitcases
are
placed
immediately
right
in
the
car,
i
think
that
ross
and
sanders
still
apply.
but
this
case,
we
have...
contraband
could
have...
we
all
know
that
narcotics
traffickers
are
liable
to
place
narcotics
anywhere
in
a
car,
in
the
hubcaps.
in
carroll,
the
individual
put
it
in
the
back
seat,
in
the
upholstery.
mr.
david
william
lee
no,
you
could.
mr.
david
william
lee
no,
i
think
ross
allows
that.
even...
in
ross
they
knew
the
specific
location
of
the
drugs.
they
had
been
told
by
the
informant
that
the
drugs
were
in
the
trunk,
and
that
is
what
we
are
arguing,
that
just
because
they
suspected
a
particular
location
in
a
car
or
in
a
particular
container
in
a
car,
they
are
not
limited
to
that
if
probable
cause
supports
the
search
of
the
entire
vehicle.
here
we
have
a
situation
which
for
all
the
reasons
i
have
stated,
and
i
might
add
that
the
fact
that
the
car
has
florida
license
plates
i
think
is
relevant.
the
court
in
the
gates
case
said
that
florida
is
a
well-known
source
of
narcotics.
i
think
that
all
these
things,
if
they
had
been
placed
in
an
affidavit
and
presented
to
a
magistrate,
the
magistrate
would
have
issued
a
search
warrant
for
the
entire
car
to
search
for
contraband
anywhere
in
that
car.
therefore,
under
the
principles
announced
by
this
court
in
the
ross
case,
the
police
were
not
required
to
resort
to
the
warrant
process.
we
think
that
the
bandaid
box
in
the
car
also
should
be
upheld
on
the
basis
of
it
being
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
under
the
robinson
case
and
the
new
york
versus
belton
case.
