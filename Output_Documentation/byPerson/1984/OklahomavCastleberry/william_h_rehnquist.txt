did
this
odor
become
apparent
to
him
after
the
suitcases
were
in
the
trunk?
justice
rehnquist
so
you
simply
can't
tell
from
his
testimony
as
to
whether
it
was
necessarily
traceable
to
the
suitcases?
justice
rehnquist
can
you
really
give
that
dogmatic
an
answer,
that
positive
an
answer?
because
as
i
understand
it
the
officers'
smell
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk
of
the
car
was
after
the
suitcases
had
been
put
in,
and
really
you
have
to...
if
you
address
the
situation
then,
you
have
to
deal
with
all
those
facts,
and
you
say
there
was
probable
cause
then.
you
don't
really
know
on
this
record
whether
an
officer,
a
hypothetical
officer
standing
near
the
car
at
the
moment
the
suitcases
were
outside
but
not
in
the
trunk
would
have
smelled
marijuana
coming
from
the
trunk.
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
facts
at
any
rate?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
you
said
you
have
no
quarrel
with
ross.
i
take
it
whatever
obstacles
are
in
your
way
here
are
created
by
the
sanders
and
chadwick
cases.
justice
rehnquist
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
have
any
great
objection
if
those
were
even
further
cut
back
than
they
have
been.
justice
rehnquist
but
how
many
times
can
they
be
distinguished
and
still
have--
justice
rehnquist
--how
long
was
he
on
the
scene
before
the
suitcases
were
placed
in
the
vehicle?
