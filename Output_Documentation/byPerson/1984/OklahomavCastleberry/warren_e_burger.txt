chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
oklahoma
against
castleberry
and
raineri.
mr.
lee,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
didn't
the
informant
add
a
little
more,
that
they
were
carrying
this
material
in
suitcases
that
were
a
particular
color?
chief
justice
burger
how
much
do
you
rely
on
the
resistance
and
flight
of
the
people
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox.
chief
justice
burger
weren't
the
results
rather
perfect,
the
color
of
the
car,
the
two
different
colors
of
suitcases,
the
time
of
the
checkout,
the
location
of
the
man,
and
his
name?
how
could
you
get
a
more
accurate,
more
completely
accurate
piece
of
information
in
advance?
chief
justice
burger
what
fact
that
was
given
by
the
informant
to
the
police
was
not
corroborated
as
the
picture
unfolded?
chief
justice
burger
isn't
that
quite
important
in
the
probable
cause
area?
chief
justice
burger
now,
what
you
are
telling
us,
is
that
the
testimony
of
castleberry
and
his
friend?
chief
justice
burger
i
did
not
think
they
had.
so
what
you
are
telling
us
is
sort
of
a
scenario
from
a
television
program,
not
the
record
of
this
case.
chief
justice
burger
well,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
were
not
the
immediate
responses
of
castleberry
and
his
friends
exactly
the
responses
of
criminals
engaged
in
drug
trafficking,
if
you
want
to
engage
in
speculation?
chief
justice
burger
how
about
the
backup
crew?
chief
justice
burger
on
the
information
that
the
police
had
when
they
saw
castleberry
come
out
of
the
motel
room,
loading
the
precisely
described
suitcases
into
the
precisely
described
car,
would
a
reasonable
officer
had
a
reasonable
basis
to
think
that
they
were
about
to
take
off?
chief
justice
burger
does
this
record
reflect
that
as
the
police
officers
approached
they
held
out
their
badge
and
said
that
they
were
police
officers?
chief
justice
burger
the
absence
of
a
uniform
isn't
really
all
that
critical,
then,
is
it?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
that
would
have...
do
you
think
they
could
acquire
a
uniform
illegally
just
as
they
could
acquire
a
badge
or
a
gun
illegally?
chief
justice
burger
even
with
a
badge
in
his
other
hand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
mr.
cox,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
burger
doesn't
that
go
to
the
credibility
of
whom
the
jury
was
going
to
believe?
you
are
questioning
whether
that
is
true
or
not,
i
take
it.
the
testimony
is--
chief
justice
burger
is
it
not
clear
now,
whatever
the
law
had
been,
that
when
there
is
probable
cause
to
search
a
car,
the
search
may
be
what
could
be
called
the
french
connection
search?
justice
white's
question
suggested
that
this
morning.
you
can
take
off
the
hubcaps,
you
can
take
off
the
tires,
and
you
can
tear
the
upholstery
apart
and
see
if
the
drugs
are
hidden
in
those
places.
now,
of
course,
if
it
turns
out
that
you
don't
find
anything,
someone
has
got
quite
a
bill
to
repair
the
car,
but
that
is
a
totally
different
matter.
you
say
there
is
no
probable
cause
to
search
the
car
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
burger
even
though...
do
you
agree
that
it
would
be
a
reasonable
inference
to
draw
for
the
police
to
think
that
this
was
going
to
be
used
to
facilitate
a
criminal
act,
the
car
was?
chief
justice
burger
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
car
would
be
part
of
the
transferring,
transporting
the
drugs?
chief
justice
burger
as
you
have
pointed
out,
they
did
not
testify
that
they
were
certain
about
the
marijuana
until
they
detected
the
odor
emanating
from
the
trunk.
chief
justice
burger
whether
that
testimony
is
true
or
not
is
not
the
question.
that
is
the
record,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
at
that
point,
was
there
not
before
the
officers
probable
cause
to
believe
there
was
marijuana
in
the
trunk
of
the
car?
chief
justice
burger
where
were
the
suitcases?
chief
justice
burger
then
what
about
the
observation
of
throwing
a
package
into
the
car
and
locking
the
door?
what
inference
should
the
policeman
draw
from
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
by
that,
he
could
have
held
the
car
and
castleberry
and
his
friend?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
