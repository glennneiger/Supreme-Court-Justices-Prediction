justice
white
those
are
two
inconsistent
answers.
that
is
inconsistent
with
what
you
have
already
said.
justice
white
there
would
still
have
been
the
possibility
you
have
just
mentioned
that
meanwhile
they
have
removed
some
of
the
drugs
to
the
car.
justice
white
you
think
we
should
judge
this
case
then
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
search
the
car
other
than
the
fact
that
these
suitcases
were
in
the
car?
justice
white
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
you
can't
say
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
search
the
car
because
of
the
smell,
and
that
there
wasn't
probable
cause
if
the
suitcases
were
just
sitting
outside.
justice
white
well,
however
all
this
might
be,
what
you
really
also
want
us
to
perform
a
small
operation
on
ross.
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
i
know
you
do,
but
do
i
understand
you
to...
is
that
all
you
are
asking
in
your
brief?
justice
white
you
don't
want
either
one
of
those
modified
to
any
extent?
justice
white
you
don't
agree
with...
aren't
there
some
amici
in
this
case
that
suggest
we
modify
ross/+/.
justice
white
--i
take
it
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
you
had
independent
probable
cause
to
search
the
car,
every
hubcap,
every
piece
of
upholstery
in
it,
if
you
also
had
probable
cause
to
search
a
specific
suitcase
that
was
in
the
car,
i
take
it
your
position
is,
you
couldn't
search
the
suitcase.
justice
white
under
ross?
justice
white
then
how
do
you
know
he
has
never
been
used
before?
justice
white
what
is
your
position
if
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
car
but
also
probable
cause
to
search
specific
containers?
justice
white
that
you
could
search
the
car
but
not
the
containers?
is
that
it?
justice
white
even
if
they
had
probable
cause
to
search
also
a
container?
justice
white
was
there
a
finding
in
the
lower
courts
as
to
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
car
independent
of
the
containers?
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
that
if
we
accept
the
fact
that
there
was
probable
cause,
the
suitcases
and
the
automobile
could
have
been
held
pending
getting
a
warrant?
