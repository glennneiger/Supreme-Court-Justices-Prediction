justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
vehicle
had
the
suitcases
not
yet
been
put
inside
it
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
say
they
do
detect
the
odor
of
marijuana,
and
all
the
other
facts
that
exist
in
this
case.
justice
o'connor
--mr.
lee,
though,
you
just
answered
justice
stevens'
questions
in
a
way
to
put
this
squarely
within
the
statement
in
ross
distinguishing
chadwick
and
sanders
on
the
ground
that
in
those
cases
the
police
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
entire
vehicle
contained
contraband,
and
you
said
here
they
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that.
all
they
had
was
what
focused
on
the
suitcases.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
own
responses
today
bring
this
within
chadwick
and
sanders.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
have
been
asked
about
it
two
or
three
times,
and
everything
i
have
heard
indicates
that
you
have
focused
exclusively
on
the
suitcases,
and
therefore
ross
wouldn't
save
you.
justice
o'connor
well,
we
asked
you
that
question,
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
vehicle
if
the
suitcases
had
been
outside.
justice
o'connor
assuming
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
the
suitcases
hadn't
been
put
in
the
vehicle.
justice
o'connor
i
am
talking
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
everything
they
knew
from
the
informant,
the
timing,
everything
they
knew
except
the
suitcases
hadn't
been
put
in
the
vehicle.
justice
o'connor
are
you
going
to
address
the
question
concerning
the
contents
of
the
bandaid
box
during
the
course
of
your
argument?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
if
the
bandaid
box
had
been
kept
on
castleberry's
person,
in
a
pocket,
at
the
time
he
was
arrested,
could
it
have
been
searched?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
result
should
be
different
if
he
throws
it
into
the
front
of
the
car
and
locks
it
to
try
to
prevent
that
from
happening?
justice
o'connor
he
should
be
rewarded
for
disobeying
the
police
officer's
instructions?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
his
actual
exercise
of
control
and
possession
over
the
box
in
putting
it
in
the
passenger
compartment
and
locking
it
is
enough
control
to
extend
belton
to
it
in
any
event?
