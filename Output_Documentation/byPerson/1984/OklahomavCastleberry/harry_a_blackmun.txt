mr.
lee,
will
you
tell
me
once
again
what
you
think
you
answered
to
justice
stevens.
justice
blackmun
don't
you
have
a
lot
more
than
the
smell
of
marijuana
in
this
case?
justice
blackmun
maybe
i
am
arguing
your
case,
but
you
seem
to
me
to
be
putting
your
entire
case
on
that
smell.
you
have
an
informant
saying
there
are
drugs
in
the
room.
you
have
the
informant
saying
that
some
were
in
the
blue
suitcase,
not
all,
but
some,
and
you
have
the
bandaid
box
incident.
i
am
trying
to
buttress
your
position
and
to
take
you
off
complete
reliance
on
the
smell
of
marijuana
from
the
trunk.
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
these
people
are
dealing
in
drugs,
wouldn't
there
be
a
pretty
good
chance
you
would
get
a
warrant
to
search
the
car,
because
that
is
just
one
of
the
normal
places
people
keep
drugs?
justice
blackmun
or
not?
