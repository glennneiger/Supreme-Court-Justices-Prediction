unknown
speaker
oh,
he
was
not?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
they
could
have
held
the
car
and
the
suitcases
until
a
warrant
was
obtained?
unknown
speaker
they
could
have
held
the
car?
unknown
speaker
and
the
suitcases.
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
then
how
could
they
hold
it?
unknown
speaker
take
one
or
the
other.
they
either
had
probable
cause
or
they
didn't.
i
think
if
they
had
known
that,
they
couldn't
get
the
warrant
either.
they
couldn't
get
a
warrant
if
they
don't
have
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
are
you
telling
us
that
this
man
could
have
driven
the
car
off
because
you
see
no
probable
cause?
if
he
had
not
been
forcibly
detained,
he
could
have
just
driven
away?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
what
would
your
position
be
if
they
did
get
a
warrant
after
that?
would
you
say
that
the
car
was--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
then
what
would
you
say
about
the
warrant?
if
they
had
forcibly
detained
them,
are
you
saying
that
they
had
no
right
to
forcibly
detain
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
judge
cornish
concurred
in
this
judgment
below,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
but
he
said,
"although
probable
cause
existed
with
regard
to
the
containers,
no
exigent
circumstances
were
shown
as
to
justify
a
warrantless
search.
"
did
the
majority
also
say
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
containers?
unknown
speaker
and
so
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
them.
unknown
speaker
and
obviously
the
trial
court
thought
so.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
asking
us
to
overturn--
unknown
speaker
could
have
held
them
all.
