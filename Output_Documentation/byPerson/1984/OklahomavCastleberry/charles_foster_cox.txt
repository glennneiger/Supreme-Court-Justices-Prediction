mr.
charles
foster
cox
mr.
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court,
respondents'
position
in
this
matter
is
that
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
was
entirely
correct
in
their
analysis
of
the
law
and
their
application
of
the
law
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
this
quite
simply
is
not
an
automobile
exception
case.
this
is
quite
simply
a
container
case
that
can
be
disposed
of
on
the
basis
of
arkansas
versus
sanders
and
chadwick.
the
government
would
argue
that
johns
and
the
court's
decision
in
johns
is
analogous
to
the
facts
of
the
case
at
bar.
i
would
only
remind
the
court
that
in
johns
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
search
that
truck
long
before
they
ever
knew
there
were
any
packages
around.
they
discovered
the
packages
only
as
a
result
of
the
search
based
on
probable
cause
of
the
truck.
here
there
was
nothing,
i
submit,
absolutely
nothing
to
suggest
to
this
police
officer
that
there
was
any
probable
cause
to
search
that
automobile
at
any
time.
the
information
provided
to
this
police
officer
was
from
a
confidential
informant
who
had
never
been
used
before,
who
the
officer
did
not
know,
who
did
not
even
identify
himself
to
the
officer,
whose
only--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--because
the
officer
admitted
so
on
the
stand,
your
honor.
that
is
in
the
record.
he
had
never
been
used
before.
it
also
said
in
the
record
that
he
had
been
referred...
that
was
the
way
the
officer
put
it...
had
been
referred
to
him
by
another
police
officer.
i
think
it
is
significant
to
note
that
in
that
referral,
the
confidential
informant
never
gave
his
name
or
mentioned
the
other
officer,
officer
joe
smith
or
whatever
told
me
i
could
call
you.
the
informant
is
unidentified.
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
to
believe
he
even
has
any
idea
what
he
is
talking
about.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
the
clerk
of
the
motel
knew
every
one
of
those
facts,
and
the
clerk
may
never
have
been
in
the
hotel
room.
those
facts
were
perfectly
obvious
to
anyone
who
knew
that
they
were
there.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
am
not
saying,
your
honor,
that
the
facts
were
not
corroborated,
but
i
am
saying
that
those
facts
by
themselves--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--it
is
our
position
there
was
never
sufficient
probable
cause
even
to
justify
the
officer
taking
out
his
weapon
and
placing
the
defendants
under
arrest.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
not
entirely
as
to
probable
cause.
if
there
was
probable
cause,
then
it
most
certainly
went
to
the
suspected
locus
of
the
contraband,
that
being
the
suitcases
and
the
bandaid
box.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
have
never
conceded
probable
cause,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
think
not,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
for
my
answer
is
that
in
the
very
practical
context
of
police
enforcement,
and
particularly
drug
enforcement,
very
seldom
do
you
see
a
police
officer
dressed
in
uniform
step
out
of
a
marked
vehicle
and
say,
i
am
a
police
officer,
pay
me
heed.
that
doesn't
happen.
as
a
practical
fact,
you
have
some
guy
in
bluejeans
with
a
beard
and
scruffy
appearance
who
gets
out
of
an
unmarked
vehicle
which
may
be
a
'54
dodge
with
a
gun
drawn
and
says,
i'm
a
police
officer.
the
defendants'
actions
are
entirely
consistent
with
trying
to
protect
their
property
from
being
robbed
as
opposed
to
protecting
it
from
police
officers.
i
know
police
officers
always
say,
and
on
television
they
always
do
draw
their
badge
and
their
gun
at
the
same
time--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--castleberry
and
raineri
did
not
testify
at
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
those
are
common
facts
in
law
enforcement,
and
although
the
record
in
this
particular
case
does
not
speak
to
those
issues,
and
perhaps
i
should
not
go
that
far--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--i
think
they
were
equally
consistent
with,
one,
he
wanted
to
protect
his
privacy
interests
and
property.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
think
that
under
ross--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--well,
i
think
under
ross,
under
the
decision
in
ross,
if
they
had
probable
cause
independent
of
any
other
matter
to
search
that
vehicle
for
contraband,
under
ross
they
could
search
that
vehicle
and
anything
they
found
there--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--yes.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
am
sure
it
does,
your
honor.
i
can't
specifically--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--pardon?
mr.
charles
foster
cox
no,
sir,
he
was
not
in
uniform.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
neither
of
the
officers
who
were
in
uniform...
who
were
there
were
in
uniform.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
neither
of
the
officers
were
in
uniform,
your
honor.
they
were
all
members
of
the
oklahoma
city
special
projects
unit,
which
was
a
special
narcotics
unit
which
has
no
uniforms.
they
wear
very
scruffy
street
clothes.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
think
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
anyone
leaving
a
motel
room
and
loading
their
luggage
is
about
to
leave
that
location,
certainly.
however,
just
because
they
placed
the
suitcases
into
the
automobile,
and
the
only
information
they
had
regarding
narcotics
was
either
the
motel
room
or
the
containers
does
not
turn
this
into
an
automobile
exception
case.
the
automobile,
as
the
state
of
oklahoma
mentioned,
was
parked
in
a
parking
lot,
and
that
parking
lot
of
a
motel
was
adjacent
to
an
interstate
highway,
but
it
must
be
emphasized
that
the
automobile
was
never
entered
by
the
defendants.
they
never
had
that
opportunity
to
get
into
the
automobile
as
if
they
wanted
to
drive
off.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
the
only
finding
of
a
lower
court,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
was
that
the
suspected
locus
of
the
contraband
was
the
suitcases
and
the
bandaid
box,
and
did
not
run
to
the
vehicle
in
general.
that
was
the
specific
holding
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma,
and
the
specific
holding
that
we
agree
with.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
yes,
it
does.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
certainly,
but
i
just
think
as
a
practical
matter
if
someone
points
a
gun
at
you
in
a
uniform,
it
carries
a
bit
more
authority
than
if
he
points
a
gun
in
bluejeans
and
a
dirty
sweatshirt.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
from
a
distance,
i
am
not
sure
a
badge
could
be
recognized
anyway.
of
course,
i
am
speculating
here,
but
i
think
it
is
important.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
mr.
justice
burger,
chief
justice
burger,
members
of
the
honorable
court,
if
i
may
continue,
i
would
like
to
begin
once
again
by
going
back
to
a
question,
i
think,
from
mr.
justice
white
which
i
think
i
misinterpreted
earlier,
before
our
lunch
break.
i
believe
you
asked
if
i
felt
that
if
there
were
probable
cause
to
search
the
automobile
and
also
probable
cause
to
search
the
containers
therein,
did
i
still
feel
that
there
was
a
warrant
necessary
to
search
those
containers.
i
think
i
answered
in
the
negative
this
morning,
and
that
is
not
my
feelings
at
all.
it
is
my
feeling--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--well,
it
does
indicate
to
the
contrary,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
merely
was
flustered
and
didn't
understand
your
question.
i
would
like
to
go
on
with
the
argument
and
address
the
point
raised
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
regarding
the
smell
or
odor
of
marijuana
which
the
officer
testified
to,
and
it
has
been
brought
up
in
relationship
to
the
johns
case.
i
think
it
is
particularly
significant
that
the
officer
did
not
mention
any
odor
of
marijuana
until
after
the
trunks
were
placed
in
the
trunk
of
the
vehicle,
the
suitcases
placed
in
the
trunk
of
the
vehicle.
the
record
is
absent
of
any
smell
of
marijuana
prior
to
the
time
those
containers
were
placed
in
the
vehicle.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
am
not
questioning,
mr.
chief
justice,
whether
it
is
true
that
he
smelled
marijuana
or
not.
i
am
saying
that
it
is
significant
that
the
only
smell
that
after
the
suitcases
were
placed
in
the
vehicle,
and
that
prior
to
that
time
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
smelled
any
marijuana.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
the
record
reflects
five
to
ten
minutes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
is
particularly
significant,
because
that
would
further
show
an
absence
of
probable
cause
to
search
the
vehicle
independent
of
the
containers
contained
therein.
the
state
of
oklahoma
mentioned
at
the
very
end
of
its
argument
that
they
thought
that
the
search
could
be
justified
under
belton
as
a
search
incident
to
lawful
arrest.
it
is
the
respondents'
position
that
the
decision
in
ross
so
effectively
undermines
belton
as
to
render
it
virtually
ineffective.
we
think
that
the
facts
of
belton
could
be
decided
under
the
automobile
exceptions
as
delineated
in
ross.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
yes,
sir.
your
statement,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
correct.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
think
based
on
the
information
that
the
officer
had,
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
well,
certainly
if
the
container...
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
a
container
contains
contraband,
and
that
contraband,
that
container
is
then
placed
in
a
vehicle,
then
the
logical
extension
of
that
is
that
if
the
vehicle
moves,
it
is
used
to
transport
the
contraband.
so,
to
that
extent,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
it
is
the
record,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
think
at
that
time,
your
honor,
if
there
were
probable
cause,
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
marijuana
in
the
suitcases.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
they
had
fortuitously
been
placed
in
the
trunk
of
that
vehicle.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
the
only
inference
that
i
think
can
be
logically
drawn
from
that
is
that
the
respondent
was
displaying
an
increased
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
container
by
further
separating
it
from
whoever
this
person
might
have
been.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
am,
your
honor.
i
address
that
from
the
standpoint
of
belton,
the
decision
in
belton
which
is
based
on
and
further
follows
the
rationale
of
chimel.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
think
under
the
current
decisions
of
this
court
probably
so.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
do.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
don't
think
of
it
in
terms
of
being
rewarded.
i
think
that
it
was
no
longer
within
the
area
with
which
he
could
reasonably
gain
control
of
it,
possession
of
it--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--no,
i
don't.
there
are
arguments
in
the
brief
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
also
in
the
brief
filed
by
amici,
the
various
amici,
friends
of
the
court,
which
ask
this
court
to
further
expand
the
decision
in
ross
to
eliminate
any
distinction
between
containers
and
automobiles.
i
would
only
submit
to
the
court
that
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
ross
is
sufficiently
clear
that
no
further
expansion
or
delineation
is
necessary.
the
argument
is
made
in
the
briefs
that
it
is
difficult
to
teach
the
principles,
the
teachings
of
ross
to
police
officers.
i
think
the
decision
in
ross
is
perfectly
clear
that
if
you
have
probable
cause
independently
of
anything,
any
containers,
to
believe
that
an
automobile,
not
knowing
whether
it
has
any
packages
in
it
or
not,
any
containers
in
it
or
not,
contains
contraband,
that
is
the
situation
that
ross
applies
to,
and
it
authorizes
a
search
of
that
vehicle
and
any
container
found
therein.
the
contrary
is
true,
that
if
you
have
knowledge
of
the
suspected
locus
of
contraband,
that
being
in
containers,
then
a
warrant
is
required
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
warrant
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
i
don't
think
that
the
argument
made
in
the
briefs
by
both
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
amici
that
the
police
are
encouraged
to
share
less
of
their
probable
cause
information
with
an
examining
magistrate
according
to
ross
because
they
would
be
rewarded
by
sharing
less
is
a
valid
argument.
i
think
that
if
officers
cannot
be
trusted
to
tell
the
truth,
and
to
tell
what
they
know
exactly
about
their
probable
cause
information,
then
they
should
not
be
rewarded
by
an
expansion
of
ross
to
eliminate
any
distinctions
whatsoever.
in
total,
i
think
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
was
exactly
correct
in
its
application
of
the
law,
that
this
was
a
chadwick,
sanders
type
case,
a
container
case,
and
not
in
fact
a
ross
case.
this
case
falls
on
the
chadwick,
sanders
side
of
the
line
as
opposed
to
ross.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
could
only
speculate
based
on
my
experience
in
oklahoma
county,
but
probably
within
the
hour.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
it
could
very
easily
have
remained
right
exactly
where
it
was.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
it
was
very
possible
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
yes,
they
could
have.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
think
they
could
have
held
the
car
if
they
had
probable--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--and
the
suitcases.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
if
they
had
sufficient
probable
cause.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
don't
think
they
had
sufficient
probable
cause.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
my
statement
was
prefaced
on
if
they
did.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
but
at
least
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
would
have
made
the
decision
that
a
warrant
would
not
have
issued.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
as
a
very
practical
matter,
i
know
that
he
would
not
have
been
allowed
to.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
think
that
they
could
have
been
detained,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
think
they
had
a
right
to
forcibly
detain
them
to
present
this
evidence
to
a
magistrate.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
specifically
states
that
the
suspected
locus
of
the
contraband
was
the
containers.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
that
is
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
that
is
correct.
the
trial
court
didn't
think
much
of
my
argument.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
i
am
not
asking
this
court
to
overturn
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
i
may
not
agree--
mr.
charles
foster
cox
--yes.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
yes.
mr.
charles
foster
cox
yes.
i
have
nothing
further.
