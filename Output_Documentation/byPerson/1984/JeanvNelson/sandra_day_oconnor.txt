justice
o'connor
mr.
kurzban,
are
any
of
the
people
detained
who
constituted
the
member
class
still
detained?
or
have
they
been
paroled?
justice
o'connor
the
court
below
remanded
the
case,
did
it
not?
justice
o'connor
for
findings
of
the
district
court?
now,
what
findings
are
open
to
the
district
court
on
remand?
is
it
compliance
with
the
government's
regulations?
justice
o'connor
the
question
of
whether
the
neutral
standards
since
adopted
by
regulation
by
the
government
were
complied
with
and
as
applied
kind
of
a
compliance
standard,
is
that
what
you
understand?
justice
o'connor
i
guess
the
difference
is
that
when
you
started
the
action
there
were
no
government
regulations
in
effect
governing
the
detention
and
parole.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
we
have
the
cart
before
the
horse
a
little
bit,
trying
to
decide
the
constitutional
issue
before
we
know
whether
in
fact
it
is
being
discriminatorily
applied?
normally
don't
we
wait
until
that
is
decided
before
going
off
on
the
constitutional
ground?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lee,
the
district
court
made
its
fact
findings
of
no
discrimination.
the
panel
of
the
appellate
court
set
that
aside,
and
disagreed
with
those
findings.
now,
shouldn't
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
have
determined
the
fact
issue
or
at
least
remanded
it
if
it
thought
additional
facts
should
have
been
found
rather
than
reaching
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
i
just
don't
understand
why
the
constitutional
issue
should
be
resolved
if
it
can
be
resolved
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
and
the
implementing
regulations.
justice
o'connor
mr.
lee.
justice
o'connor
in
your
view,
would
the
constitution
provide
any
protections
to
people
being
detained
pending
parole
as
to
the
conditions
of
their
detention?
justice
o'connor
well,
are
they
really
identical,
mr.
lee,
because
presumably
someone
paroled
could
have
parole
revoked
and
then
be
excluded,
could
they
not?
