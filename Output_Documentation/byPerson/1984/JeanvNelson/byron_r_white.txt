well,
it
may
not
be...
even
if
it
isn't
moot,
it
may
not
be
ripe,
the
constitutional
issue.
you
really
don't
know
what
is
going
to
happen
to
these
400
people
until
your
remand
is
completed.
justice
white
even
though
the
regulations
forbid
it?
justice
white
you
think
the
lower-level
people
just
continue
to
violate
the
law?
justice
white
well,
if
they
are
going
to
do
that,
an
injunction
won't
do
you
much
good.
justice
white
we
wouldn't
issue
the
injunction.
justice
white
you
would
just
have
another
reason...
you
would
just
have
another
weapon
to
use
against
lawless
conduct,
but
there
is
already
a
weapon
to
use
against
it.
there
are
laws
and
regulations
that
forbid
this
kind
of
application
of
the
law.
