mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
assume
that
it
goes
without
saying
that
there
is
no
warrant
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case.
it
is
very
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
simply
governmental
discrimination
was
urged
both
before
the
panel
and
also
before
the
en
banc
court,
and
it
was
only
the
shift
that
was
made
really
before
this
court
and
that
came
out
during
the
oral
argument
before
the
eleventh
circuit
that
mr.
kurzban
is
now
emphasizing
the
difference
between
the
statutory
remedy
and
the
constitutional
remedy.
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
has
clearly
stated
the
law
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
congress
to
parole
pending
the
determination
whether
to
admit
or
to
exclude,
and
the
petitioners
should
not
by
their
own
change
of
position
be
permitted
to
achieve
a
vacation
of
that
correct
determination
of
the
law.
let
me
say
that
we
strongly
disagree
with
the
assertions
that
the
government
has
not
contested
the
allegations
of
national
origin
and
racial
discrimination.
it
did.
there
was
a
six-week
trial
on
that
issue,
and
the
district
court
made
a
finding
that
there
was
no
discrimination,
but
the
real
point
for
present
purposes
is
that
those
allegations
of
national
origin
distinctions
are
irrelevant.
the
reason
is,
and
the
whole
case
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
the
same
rules
that
this
court
has
pronounced
over
a
period
of
more
than
a
century
applicable
to
the
decision
whether
to
admit
or
to
exclude
are
also
both
from
considerations
of
the
practical
necessities
of
the
parole
decision
and
also
by
the
square
holding
of
this
court
in
mezei,
which
has
not
been
overruled,
required
to
be
judged
by
the
same
standards.
what
i
propose
to
do
is
to
develop
first
those
rules
that
pertain
to
the
entry
decision,
whether
the
alien
is
to
be
admitted
or
excluded,
and
then
to
develop
our
argument
that
the
same
rules
apply
to
parole.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
what
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
did
was
exactly
right
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
it
simply
held
that
those
allegations
were
irrelevant,
and
for
reasons
that
i
am
about
to
develop,
that
holding
was
absolutely
right.
second,
even
as
a
fallback
position
under
the
rules...
i
believe
it
is
rule
26
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit...
it
is
cited
in
our
brief...
the
granting
of
a
suggestion
of
rehearing
en
banc
automatically
vacates
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
that
is,
the
panel
opinion,
so
that
the
panel's--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
any
serious
disagreement
with
you.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
in
the
process,
since
it
was
our
friends
who
asked
the
court
to
resolve
that
issue
that
that
panel...
excuse
me,
the
en
banc
opinion
not
be
vacated,
because
clearly
it
should
not
be
vacated.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
precisely.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
that,
of
course,
gets
us
back
also
to
what
i
will
refer
to
as
the
ashwander
point,
whether
it
should
be
resolved
on
some
non-constitutional...
whether
the
whole
case
should
be
resolved
on
some
non-constitutional
ground
as
opposed
to
the
constitutional
ground.
and
normally
that
is
the
approach
that
ought
to
be
taken,
and
certainly
we
would
have
no
objection
to
the
court
taking
that
approach
in
this
case.
i
would
simply
point
out
in
fairness
that
this
case
may
different,
because
not
only
have
the
petitioners
switched
positions
in
midstream,
but
also,
as
i
read
it,
the
ashwander
approach
is
a
discretionary
approach
that
says
that
we
are
not
going
to
reach
constitutional
issues
unless
we
have
to
reach
them,
but
it
is
not...
it
may
be
in
this
particular
instance
that
the
court
might
conclude,
given
the
review
of
that
district
court
opinion,
that
the
likelihood
that
that
court
is
going
to
change
its
view
is
so
remote
that
this
court
should
simply
proceed
immediately
to
affirm
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
am
not
sure.
it
may
have
been
on
an
assumption,
justice
stevens,
that
these
400
people
to
whom
mr.
kurzban
referred,
who
have
got
to
be
post-judge
spellman's
entry
arrivals,
are
part
of
the
class.
now,
judge
spellman
has
indicated
in
a
footnote
that
that
may
not
be
the
case,
but
it
may
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
they
were
part
of
the
class,
and
therefore
evidence
could
be
introduced
as
to
them.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
not
necessarily,
if
you
do
assume
that
the
class
applies
to
these
post-judgment
arrivals,
because
there
could
be
some
additional
facts--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--they
are,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
because
as
to
the
pre-judgment
arrivals,
they
were
all
released,
because
of
the
apa
ruling.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
one
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i
am
just
not
sure
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
mind
as
to
that
particular
aspect.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
is
just
that
particular...
it
is
just
that
particular...
there
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
except
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
the
issue
as
to
whether
these
400
are
or
are
not
part
of
the
class.
they
may
have...
i
say
they
may
have
assumed
that
they
are
part
of
a
class.
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
be
that
there
is
some
other
evidence
other
than
the
statistical
evidence
which
had
already
been
presented
that
the
court
of
appeals
anticipated
might
be
introduced.
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
is
an
analytically
sound
one.
the
question
as
to
what
additional
evidence
might
come
in
is
something
that
can
be
determined
once
the
case
gets
back
to
district
court.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
the
400
are
here.
i
would
assume...
i
don't
know
to
whom
mr.
kurzban
was
referring,
but
i
would
assume
they
would
have
to
be
post-judgment
arrivals,
because
the
original
members
of
the
class
were
all
released
on
parole
because
of
the
other
aspect,
because
of
the
apa
aspect
of
the
ruling.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
you
mean
in
this
court?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
it
is
not
clear
that
they
are.
they
arrived
after
the
lawsuit...
after
the
judgment
was
entered.
starting
with
the
chinese
exclusion
case
just
about
a
century
ago,
this
court
has
consistently
reasserted
the
distinction
between
the
authority
of
the
political
branches
over,
on
the
one
hand,
aliens
who
have
actually
entered
the
country,
even
though
the
entry
might
have
been
illegal,
and
persons
like
petitioners
who
at
least
in
a
legal
sense
have
not
yet
penetrated
our
borders.
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
and
the
attorney
general
over
aliens
who
have
entered
is
very
large.
over
those
who
have
not,
it
is
a
power
that
simply
knows
no
counterpart
in
any
other
corner
of
our
constitutional
jurisprudence.
as
the
court
said
a
couple
of
terms
ago
in
landon
versus
plasencia,
an
alien
seeking
admission
to
our
shores
has
no
constitutional
rights
regarding
his
application.
that
does
not
mean
that
he
is
not
a
person
under
the
constitution.
nor
does
it
mean
that
he
has
no
constitutional
protections.
it
simply
means
that
the
limited
package
of
rights
which
he
enjoys
does
not
include
rights
with
respect
to
the
substantive
decision
whether
it
will
be
admitted
or
excluded.
it
is
a
principle
that
is
bottomed
not
only
on
congress's
constitutional
power
over
immigration
and
naturalization,
but
also
on
the
responsibility
of
the
political
branches
over
foreign
affairs
and
national
security.
the
power
to
control
entry
is
an
inherent
attribute
of
sovereignty
for
this
or
any
other
country.
this
nation
has
always
been
one
of
the
most
generous
in
admitting
foreigners
into
our
midst.
would
that
we
could
do
more.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
you
don't
have
to.
the
case,
however,
is
not
moot.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
what
your
question
really
goes
to,
justice
stevens,
is
whether
certiorari
ought
to
have
been
granted
in
this
case
in
the
first
place.
we
opposed
it.
however,
there
has,
in
fairness
to
the
court,
there
has
been
nothing
that
has
happened
prior
to
the
time
that
you
disagreed
with
me
on
the
circuit
and
as
a
consequence,
since
the
case
is
here,
since
there
hasn't
been
anything
that
has
happened
since
the
grant
of
certiorari,
and
since
this
very
issue
is
one
that
divided
a
panel
and
the
en
banc
circuit,
and
since
it
is
a
question
of
very
large
importance
to
the
administration
of
the
immigration
and
nationalization
laws,
we
would
like
to
have
the
answer.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
now,
the
real
question,
the
real
question
then
is
whether
this
established
right
to
exclude
or
to
admit
also
applies
to
the
parole
stage.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes
for
two
reasons.
the
first
one
is
that
the
rationale
underlying
the
admission
rule
also
requires
that
parole,
which
in
practical
effect
really
is
admission,
be
treated
the
same
as
exclusion.
and
second,
this
court
has
squarely
held
that
they
are
to
be
treated
the
same.
prior
to
1950--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
as
i
read
this
court's
decisions,
justice
o'connor,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
what
landon
versus
plasencia
said,
and
what
i
think
the
cases
hold,
is
that
the
exclusion
of
their
constitutional
rights
relates
to
the
decision
whether
to
admit
or
not
to
admit,
and
of
course
the
question
here
is,
does
that
also
extend
to
parole.
prior
to
1954,
parole
was
rarely
granted.
ellis
island
functioned
principally
as
a
holding
point
pending
admission
or
exclusion.
but
in
1954,
we
tried
a
new
approach.
the
facility
ellis
island
was
closed.
parole
was
freely
granted.
and
for
more
than
two
decades
no
serious
problems
resulted.
by
the
late
1970's,
however
aliens
had
begun
to
arrive
in
south
florida
in
such
unprecedented
and
unmanageable
numbers,
including
some
125,000
cubans
who
arrived
in
the
port
of
mariel
in
the
spring
of
1980,
that
it
was
apparent
to
our
national
leaders
that
something
had
to
be
done.
in
february
of
1981,
president
carter's
specially
appointed
select
commission
on
immigration,
consisting
of
congressional
representatives
as
well
as--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
the
report
was,
but
the
appointment
of
the
commission,
the
appointment
of
the
commission
occurred
in
1980,
and
the
report
was
issued
in
1981.
that
report
concluded
two
things.
one
was
that
there
was
an
immigration
crisis
that
existed
in
the
country,
and
the
second
was
that
there
were
two
reasons
for
it.
one,
the
arrival
of
increasing
numbers
of
aliens
lacking
required
entry
visas,
and
the
post-1954
policy
of
routine
paroles
prior
to
admissions
hearings.
the
succeeding
administration
continued
the
attempts
to
deal
with
this
crisis,
and
a
key
element
of
the
policy
that
it
adopted,
a
policy
which
was
recommended
by
the
president's
cabinet
level
task
force,
approved
by
the
president
and
announced
by
the
attorney
general,
called
for
more
restrictive
use
of
parole,
and
increased
use
of
detention.
in
every
meaningful
respect,
parole
and
entry
are
parts
of
the
same
whole,
namely,
the
power
of
this
nation
to
decide
who
will
be
permitted
entry.
there
are
good
reasons
for
mainly
this
or
any
other
nation
to
exclude
some
people,
national
security
reasons,
health
and
safety
reasons,
disease
control,
citizen
employment,
and
others.
those
same
reasons
also
apply
to
parole,
because
what
is
at
issue
in
both
contexts
is
exactly
the
same,
whether
aliens
will
be
admitted
into
our
national
community
without
first
making
the
necessary
showing
that
they
are
entitled
to
enter.
the
differences
between
parole
and
admission
are
differences
of
degree.
parole
may
be
for
a
short
time
and
it
may
be
for
a
long
time,
but
during
the
interim,
the
same
risks
are
at
work
that
lead
government
to
exclude
until
eligibility
is
established.
so
long
as
the
inflow
is
modest,
those
risks
may
be
bearable,
but
when
that
reaches
the
crisis
point,
and
when
two
successive
administrations
conclude
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
crisis
is
too
loose
standards
being
applied
at
the
parole
stage,
then
surely
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
the
congress
and
the
attorney
general
from
preventing
entry
to
those
who
have
not
proven
their
entitlement
to
enter.
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
government's
constitutional
power
over
parole
depends
on
the
existence
of
a
crisis.
it
is
simply
that
our
experience
of
recent
years
shows
the
wisdom
of
this
court's
holding
in
mezei
that
parole
is
a
part
of
the
admission
exclusion
holding.
the
reason
that
shaughnessy
versus
united
states
ex.
rel.
mezei
controls
this
case,
and
the
reason
that
all
of
the
petitioners'
attempts
to
distinguish
it
are
irrelevant
are
tied
to
the
holding
of
that
case
that
the
decision
whether
to
parole
or
not
to
parole
is
a
part
of
the
exclusion-admission
total
package,
and
therefore
governed
by
the
same
judicial
standard.
i
submit
that
mezei
also
shows
the
firmness
and
the
universality
of
that
rule,
because
if
there
were
ever
to
be
an
exception,
a
case
whose
peculiar
facts
would
have
justified
treating
the
parole
decision
as
something
separate
from
the
admission
decision,
would
surely
have
been
mr.
mezei's
case,
because
unlike
the
petitioners
here,
there
was
literally
no
other
place
in
the
world
where
he
could
go.
the
petitioners
stress
the
similarities
between
the
parolee
and
the
excludable
alien,
and
the
differences
between
the
parole
and
the
alien
subject
to
deportation.
they
also
rely
on
the
holding
in
leng
may
ma
v.
barber
that
a
paroled
alien
did
not
lose
her
excludable
status,
and
we
agree.
parole
is
like
exclusion.
our
point
is
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
like
exclusion,
as
it
is
under
mezei.
the
petitioners'
point,
of
course,
is
that
since
the
parole
is
still
excludable
once
paroled,
the
government
does
not
give
up
a
lot
by
extending
parole,
but
that
argument
is
multiply
flawed.
first,
the
judgments
concerning
just
how
much
the
government
gives
up
are
judgments
to
be
made
by
congress
and
by
the
attorney
general.
second,
this
court
in
mezei
squarely
resolved
the
issue
against
the
petitioners,
and
that
holding
is
dispositive.
and
finally,
the
petitioners
are
simply
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact.
there
are
good
reasons
not
to
parole
pending
admission,
and
the
petitioners'
position
is
at
odds
with
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
two
presidential
commissions
in
this
respect.
the
petitioners'
efforts
to
distinguish
mezei
are
discussed
in
our
brief.
it
was
not
called
into
question
at
all
by
plasencia.
in
plasencia,
there
was
no
issue
of
either
exclusion
or
parole.
rather,
the
holding
was
simply
that
it
was
an
exclusion
hearing
to
which
ms.
plasencia
was
entitled.
i
would
like
to
discuss
just
one
of
the
petitioners'
bases
for
alleged
distinction
of
the
mezei
case,
and
that
is
that
in
mr.
kurzban's
words,
this
is
a
case
about
illegal
discrimination,
that
this
case
is
different
because
there
is
an
allegation
of
national
origin
discrimination
which
in
other
contexts
bring
into
play
heightened
judicial
scrutiny.
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
it
comes
about
13
years
and
three
rounds
too
late,
because
that
same
argument
that
reliance
by
the
excluded
alien
on
constitutional
positions
which
in
other
contexts
entitle
their
beneficiaries
to
heightened
scrutiny
was
attempted
13
years
ago
in
mandel,
five
years
later
in
fiallo,
and
rejected
both
times.
in
mandel
it
was
first
amendment
interests
which
were
at
stake,
and
in
fiallo
classifications
based
on
legitimacy,
both
of
which
are
entitled
to
heightened
scrutiny.
indeed,
if
anything,
those
were
stronger
cases
against
the
government,
because
in
both
of
those
the
argument
in
favor
of
the
excluded
alien
also
rested
in
substantial
part,
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
his
separate
opinion
in
fiallo,
on
the
rights
of
citizens.
in
mandel,
it
was
the
acknowledged
right
of
american
citizens
to
receive,
to
hear
professor
mandel's
thoughts
and
words.
and
in
fiallo,
it
was
the
rights
of
american
citizens
who
were
the
kinfolk
of
the
excluded
aliens.
nevertheless,
the
argument
was
rejected
both
times,
and
in
fiallo
the
court
was
quite
explicit
as
to
the
reason.
the
court
reasoned
as
follows,
quoting
from
justice
frankfurter's
separate
opinion
in
harisiades:
"the
conditions
of
entry
for
every
alien,
the
particular
classes
of
aliens
that
shall
be
denied
entry
altogether.
"
and
then
several
others,
"have
been
recognized
as
matters
solely
for
the
responsibility
of
the
congress
and
wholly
outside
the
power
of
this
court
to
control.
"
those
judgments
described
by
fiallo,
the
conditions
of
entry
for
every
alien,
and
the
particular
classes
of
aliens
that
shall
be
denied
entry
altogether
are
the
precise
issues,
the
precise
judgments
at
issue
in
mandel,
again
in
fiallo,
and
again
in
this
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
so.
the
distinction
that
i
would
draw
has
to
do
with
the
distinction
between
judgments
that
pertain
to
whether
or
not
the
person
does
penetrate
our
shores
temporarily
or
permanently.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
is
our
position
that
they
are
identical,
because
the
decision
whether
to
parole
or
not
to
parole
is
really
a
decision
whether
to
admit
or
not
to
admit.
the
only
difference
is
a
time
difference.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
not,
because
those
do
not
pertain
to
the
judgment
whether
to
admit
or
not
admit.
and
that
is
the
dividing
line
in
my
view,
and
i
think--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--of
course,
and
an
alien
once
admitted
can
also
have
that
admission
revoked,
and
can
be
deported,
but
the
point
is,
and
i
am
merely
faithfully
reporting
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
i
read
them,
the
point
is
that
the
crucial
distinction
as
announced
by
this
court
in
landon
versus
plasencia
is
rights
pertaining
to
his
admission,
because
the
question
is,
is
he
to
be
held,
so
to
speak,
on
the
boat,
and
not
permitted
to
enter
until
such
time
as
we
make
a
judgment
whether
he
really
fits
the
category
of
persons
who
are
entitled
to
enter,
and
that
is
what
makes
the
difference
between
the
exclusion
cases
and
the
deportation
cases.
and
with
regard
to
those
matters,
exclusion
and
parole
are
part
of
the
same
package,
both
legally
and
also
as
a
matter
of
practical
operational
fact.
finally,
the
issue
in
this
case
really
comes
down
to
congress's
constitutional
authority.
what
congress
has
done
is
to
establish
a
constitutional
rule
that...
or,
excuse
me,
is
to
establish
a
statutory
command
that
aliens
are
to
be
excluded,
period,
and
then
it
gives
to
the
attorney
general
the
discretion
to
determine
in
his
discretion
whether
in
certain
instances
parole
or
temporary
admission
should
be
granted.
accordingly,
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
petitioners
are
right
or
we
are
right
concerning
the
likely
risk
of
admitting
aliens
prior
to
the
time
that
their
entry
decision
is
made.
rather,
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
the
constitutional
authority
to
make
exclusion
the
general
rule
and
then
give
the
attorney
general
the
discretion
to
make
some
exceptions.
given
this
court's
precedents,
i
submit
that
is
simply
not
a
closed
question.
as
justice
frankfurter
sad
in
galvan
v.
press,
and
this
court
has
repeated
frequently,
we
are
dealing
here
not
with
merely
a
page
of
history,
but
a
whole
volume,
and
that
volume
of
history
clearly
puts
parole
into
the
same
package
with
admission
exclusion.
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
held
in
mezei.
if
there
were
ever
to
be
an
exception,
it
would
have
been
in
mezei,
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
