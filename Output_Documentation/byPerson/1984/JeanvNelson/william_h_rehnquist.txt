justice
rehnquist
mr.
kurzban,
is
it
your
position
that
the
government
may
not
discriminate
in
administering
the
immigration
laws
on
the
basis
of
nationality?
justice
rehnquist
is
that
because
of
the
regulations
and
the
statute?
justice
rehnquist
we've
got
two
separate
questions,
i
think.
the
first
is
perhaps
the
abstract
one,
can
congress
pass
a
statute
that
discriminates
in
the
administration
of
the
immigration
laws
on
the
basis
of
national
origin,
but
i
thought
from
your
answer
perhaps
it
is
the
second
one
raised
here,
where
congress
and
the
president
have
taken
the
position
that
there
will
not
be
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
national
origin.
then
you
don't
get
to
the
constitutional
issue
because
the
low-level
people
are
bound
either
by
the
administrative
regulations
or
by
the
statute.
justice
rehnquist
we
ordinarily
require
something
more
of
a
controversy
than
just
a
debate
about
moral
force.
justice
rehnquist
general
lee,
you
say
as
i
understand
it
the
reasoning
of
the
en
banc
court
was
that
these
allegations
of
national
origin
discrimination
were
irrelevant
because
the
government
has
the
power
to
engage
in
national--
justice
rehnquist
--but
if
the
court
below
had
made
finding
that
there
was
no
national
origin
discrimination,
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
o'connor's
question
is
very
apt.
why
don't
you
first
address
the
findings
and
see
whether
you
have
to
come
to
make
a
constitutional
adjudication
that
they
are
irrelevant.
justice
rehnquist
shortly
after
he
left
office?
