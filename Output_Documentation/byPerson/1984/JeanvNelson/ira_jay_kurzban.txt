mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
case
about
invidious
discrimination
in
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws
of
the
united
states
against
black
haitian
refugees
who
were
seeking
political
asylum
in
the
united
states.
for
over
ten
years,
immigration
enforcement
officials
in
south
florida
have
applied
the
law
with
an
unequal
hand
and
an
evil
eye,
as
this
court
said
in
yick
wo
v.
hopkins,
against
haitians
seeking
political
asylum
as
is
their
right
under
the
statutes
and
treaties
of
the
united
states.
although
it
has
occurred
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
this
case
raises
the
issue
with
respect
to
detention
and
parole
and
discrimination
in
that
detention
and
parole.
in
the
spring
of
1981,
approximately
1,700
haitians
came
to
the
united
states
fleeing
the
politically
repressive
conditions
and
the
persecution
of
their
homeland
in
haiti.
unlike
refugees
such
as
nicaraguan
refugees,
such
as
cuban
refugees,
who
entered
south
florida
at
the
same
time,
under
the
same
circumstances,
and
indeed,
unlike
other
excludable
aliens
who
entered
the
united
states
at
the
same
time,
haitians
and
haitians
alone
were
incarcerated.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
yes,
your
honor,
although
it
is
not
in
the
record
directly,
there
are
400,
approximately
400
haitians
who
are
presently
detained,
and
they
constitute
70
percent
of
the
population
incarcerated
at
the
present
time
in
south
florida.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
i
think
it
is
very
unclear,
to
be
quite
frank,
your
honor,
about
what
the
standard
is
on
remand
and
what
the
en
banc
court
said.
they
said
that
it
should
be
remanded
on
a
facially
legitimate
and
bona
fide
standard.
that--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
again,
i
honestly
think
it
is
unclear.
i
think
they
remanded
it
back
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
discrimination
with
respect
to
the
400
people,
but
they
paid
lip
service
to
that
discrimination
because
they
did
it
under
a
standard
which
in
effect
is
a
narrow
standard,
appropriate
in
other
contexts
such
as
the
substantive
review
of
a
decision,
as
justice
blackmun
found
in
kleindienst
versus
mandel,
of
the
attorney
general.
but
it
is
not
clear
what
the
ultimate
outcome
of
that
review
would
be,
and
in
addition
they
gave
no
relief
to
the
1,700
class
members
who
have
been
released
and
at
the
same
time
they
lifted
the
injunction
that
prevented
the
government
from
reincarcerating
those
1,700.
so
those
1,700
petitioners
that
are
still
part
of
this
class
are
subject
to
being
incarcerated
again,
and
we
have
no
reason
to
believe,
based
on
the
continuing
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination,
that
haitians
who
have
suffered
in
south
florida
based
on
that
continuing
pattern,
that
these
haitians
will
not
be
redetained
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
but
there
was
a
statute,
your
honor,
that
said...
there
was
a
facially
neutral
statute,
1182(d)(5),
and
low-level
immigration
officials
enforced
that
statute
in
a
discriminatory
way.
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
today
and
in
fact
we
believe
that
they
are
enforcing
their
present
policy
in
the
same
discriminatory
manner,
and
unless
this
court
makes
it
clear
that
the
immigration
service
cannot
enforce
a
neutral
statute
or
regulation--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
some
circumstances
that
is
correct,
but
not
in
this
circumstance,
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
remand
standard
offers
no
relief
for
the
1,700
petitioners,
as
i
said.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
grounds
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case,
they
remanded
it
under
a
facially
legitimate
and
bona
fide
standard.
that
standard
is
not
sufficient
to
protect
against
race
and
nationality
discrimination,
because
that
standard,
while
appropriate
in
the
context
of
such
cases
as
fiallo
versus
bell
and
in
kleindienst
versus
mandel,
where
the
court
paid
great
deference
to
the
decisions
of
congress
and
the
attorney
general,
is
inappropriate
where
congress
has
spoken,
where
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
have
spoken,
and
where
low-level
officials
have
discriminated
anyway.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
depends
on
who
we
are
talking
about.
here,
on
the
facts
of
this
record,
where
congress
required
a
facially
neutral
statute
and
had
on
under
1182(d)(5),
where
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
both
made
it
clear
that
it
should
be
an
even-handed
policy,
where
congress
has
specifically
only
given
the
authority
to
the
president
under
1182(f)
and
under
1185
to
make
distinctions
under
classes
of
aliens,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
i
think
that
immigration
officials
do
not
have
the
right
to
make
that
distinction
based
on
nationality.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
no,
it
is
because
this
court
has
always
recognized
that
race
and
national
origin
discrimination
are
suspect--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--i
do
not
know
that
that
follows,
your
honor,
because
on
the
record
in
this
case,
they
remanded
it
back
on
a
standard
that
masks
discrimination.
the
standard
here
is
not
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
the
standard
here
is
facially
legitimate
and
bona
fide.
moreover,
when
the
en
banc
court
of
the
elevent
circuit
has
made
it
clear
that
the
united
states
constitution
is
irrelevant,
they
said
no
constitutional
review
is
irrelevant
to
race
and
nationality
discrimination.
i
think
that
the
moral
force
of
stating
that
the
constitution
applies
in
this
circumstance
is
important.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
is
a
very
live
controversy
here,
with
the
1,700
people
who
have
been
released
and
for
whom
the
injunction
has
now
been
lifted
by
the
en
banc
court's
decision,
who
are
subjected
to
being
redetained,
and
in
footnote
10
of
the
government's
brief,
they
indicate
that
they
may
very
well
redetain
them.
and
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
the
mere
cessation
of
illegal
conduct,
which
we
believe,
by
the
way,
has
not
occurred
here...
we
believe
the
government
is
continuing
to
discriminate,
as
they
have
for
ten
years.
but
the
mere
cessation
of
that
conduct,
they
are
getting
up
here
today
and
saying,
we
will
not
redetain
these
people
based
on
national
origin,
based
on
the
history
of
the
service's
discriminatory
actions,
is
not
enough
to
moot
this
case
out.
when
the
haitians
arrived
in
the
united
states,
they
represented
less
than
2
percent
of
the--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
is
right
because
we
are
dealing
with
this
case
from
the
standpoint
of
a
continuing
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination.
we
know
that
70
percent
of
the
haitians...
70
percent
of
the
aliens
who
were
detained
are
haitian.
we
have
no
reason
to
believe,
and
in
fact
believe
quite
strongly
that
the
service
is
engaging
in
the
same
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
well,
what
we
are
asking
for,
your
honor...
maybe
it
hasn't
been
made
clear.
what
we
are
asking
for
is
declaratory
injunctive
relief,
stating
that
the
immigration
service
cannot
use
the
impermissible
criteria
of
race
and
national
origin
in
making
determinations
about
parole.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
well,
just
as
the
statute--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--absolutely,
your
honor.
just
as
the
statute,
just
as
the
1952
statute,
1182(d)(5),
did
not
give
them
the
authority
to
discriminate
based
on
race
or
national
origin.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
i
think
if
this
court
issued
an
injunction
and
issued
a
declaration--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
i
think
if
this
court
issued
a
declaration
and
remanded
it
back
to
the
en
banc
court
to
issue
an
injunction--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
continuing
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination,
despite
neutral
statutes.
that
is
the
problem.
this
is
not
just
an
isolated
case.
in
1980,
for
example,
the
district
court
in
another
case
called
haitian
refugee
center
versus
civiletti
found
that
the
immigration
service
violated
the
statutes
that
allow
people
to
claim
political
asylum
in
the
united
states,
and
violated
it
with
respect
to
4,000
haitians
seeking
political
asylum
in
our
country.
that
was
in
1980,
and
in
1981,
we
had
the
very
same
conduct
we
have
here.
the
effect
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
en
banc
court
decision
is
to
say
that
the
united
states
constitution
is
irrelevant
to
protect
against
invidious
race
and
nationality
discrimination.
they
have
in
effect--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--i
think
if
it
is
done
under
the
constitution--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--i
think
that
coupled
with
declaratory
relief
making
it
clear
that
the
government
cannot
use
the
impermissible
criteria
of
race
or
national
origin--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--yes
and
no.
in
a
way,
yes,
but
in
a
way,
no.
and
the
no
is
that
here
we
have
the
eleventh
circuit
en
banc
who
are
making
a
statement--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
in
part,
yes,
but
also
because
the
eleventh
circuit
here
has
made
a
statement
saying
the
constitution
does
not
apply,
and
what
we
are
asking
is
that
that
decision
be--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--under
what
standard?
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
well,
the
problem
here
is
that
the
eleventh
circuit
also
remanded
it
back
on
a
facially
legitimate
and
bona
fide
standard.
if
that
is
going
to
be
the
standard
of
review,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
adequate
to
protect
against
race
or
nationality
discrimination.
that
is
the
problem
here.
we
don't
just
have
the
eleventh
circuit
remanding
it
back
on
a
general
standard.
they
remanded
it
back
on
a
very,
very
narrow
standard
which--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--would
it
be
covered
with
declaratory
relief
i
think
is
the
question.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
i
think
given
the
history
of
discrimination
here,
given
that
continuing
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination,
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
issue
a
declaration
making
it
clear
that
under
the
constitution
no
race
and
nationality
discrimination
is
permissible.
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
an
overwhelming
pattern
of
race
and
nationality
discrimination.
that
race
and
nationality
discrimination
has
been
wholly
unregarded
by
the
government
on
the
record
of
this
case
except
for
mere
protestations
of
innocence.
the
statistical
evidence
demonstrated
a
stark
pattern
of
race
and
national
origin
discrimination
wholly
unrebutted
by
the
government,
but
statistics
alone
were
not
at
issue
here.
petitioners
presented
documentary
evidence,
testimonial
evidence,
all
of
it
going
to
the
question
of
both
race
and
national
origin,
and
all
of
it
unrebutted
by
the
government.
the
government's
arguments
in
this
case
are
largely
arguments
that
are
not
in
response
to
the
issues
presented
on
the
facts
of
this
record.
the
government
suggests
that
finding
the
constitution
applicable
will
affect
the
sovereign
power
to
control
our
borders.
we
are
not
seeking
from
this
court
any
determination
about
any
substantive
review
of
any
individual
parole
decision.
what
we
are
seeking
merely
is
the
equal
enforcement
of
the
statutes
as
congress
and
the
president
have
promulgated.
if
tomorrow
the
congress
were
to
pass
a
statute
that
said
no
one
shall
be
paroled,
that
is
not
the
case
before
this
court.
however,
here,
beginning
in
1954,
congress
passed
a
statute
that
said
you
made
parole.
that
statute,
from
1954
to
1981,
was
enforced
in
a
way
that
allowed
people
to
be
paroled
if
they
were
not
likely
to
abscond
or
were
not
a
security
risk.
in
1981,
when
the
policy
changed
after
27
years,
that
policy
was
applied
in
a
discriminatory
manner
to
haitians
and
haitians
alone.
the
government
contends
here
that
both
the
congress
and
the
president
have
broad
powers
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
we
are
not
contesting
that
here
today.
this
is
a
situation
where
congress,
the
president,
and
indeed
even
the
attorney
general
made
it
clear
that
the
statute,
1182(d)(5),
should
be
enforced
in
a
facially
neutral
way.
the
government
has
argued
that
due
process
does
not
augment
the
statutory
rights
to
admission.
this
is
not
an
admissions
case.
this
is
a
case,
as
congress
has
made
it
perfectly
clear
in
1182(d)(5)
that
separates
out
something
we
call
parole
from
admissions.
parole
is
a
temporary
release
until
a
final
determination
is
made
about
admissions.
the
government
contends
that
nationality
discrimination
can
be
drawn
in
the
formulation
of
policy.
this
is
not
a
question
about
policy.
this
is
a
question
about
enforcement,
and
even
the
language
that
the
government
quotes
from
galvan
versus
press
when
justice
frankfurter
said,
"we
are
not
writing
on
a
clean
slate
but
100
years
of
history.
"
even
there
justice
frankfurter
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
when
it
comes
to
the
enforcement
of
the
immigration
statutes,
due
process
applies.
the
united
states
congress
in
1965
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
they
would
abolish
all
nationality
istinctions
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
in
1980,
they
reaffirmed
that
principle
with
respect
to
refugees,
and
in
1967
we
agreed
and
became
signatories
to
the
united
nations
convention
and
protocol
with
respect
to
the
status
of
refugees
which
in
article
3
has
a
non-discrimination
provision.
the
government
contends
here
that
judicial
review
under
the
constitution
will
somehow
affect
its
powers,
but
this
court,
justice
powell
in
fiallo
versus
bell
made
it
very
clear
in
footnote
5
that
even
in
the
question
of
congress's
power
to
act
on
matters
of
admission,
even
on
those
questions,
it
will
be
subjected
to
a
constitutional
standard.
finally,
the
government
contends
that
shaughnessy
versus
mezei
controls
this
case.
in
shaughnessy
versus
mezei,
the
question
of
admission
was
really
the
question
at
issue
in
that
case.
to
release
mezei
was
the
equivalent
of
granting
him
the
admission
that
the
attorney
general
had
already
determined
that
he
could
not
get.
in
mezei
the
attorney
general
had
made
a
decision.
he
had
decided
in
that
case
that
the
alien
was
excludable
on
national
security
grounds
and
on
the
facts
of
that
case
to
allow
him
them
to
assert
a
procedural
due
process
right
to
be
released
would
have
the
effect
of
reversing
the
determination
that
he
was
an
excludable
alien.
shaughnessy
versus
mezei
was
also
determined
before
this
court
made
its
determination
in
bolling
versus
sharpe.
it
was
determined
before
the
fifth
amendment
was
found
to
be
a
source
of
equal
protection.
equal
protection
was
never
raised
in
any
case.
finally,
i
note,
as
justice
o'connor
implicitly,
i
think,
noted
in
landon
versus
plasencia,
that
the
scope
of
mezei
is
in
some
doubt,
and
i
think
it
is
in
some
doubt
because
in
reality
on
the
facts
of
mezei,
mezei
was
really
a
returning
resident
to
the
united
states.
he
had
lived
in
the
united
states
for
many
years,
and
he
was
returning.
this
court
in
landon
versus
plasencia
said
that
even
though
an
alien
will
be
treated
as
an
excludable
alien
who
is
a
returning
resident,
he
is
still
entitled
to
due
process
protections.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
issue
at
stake
here
is
the
same
issue
of
equal
protection
and
equal
justice
under
law
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
and
particularly
in
truax
v.
corrigan,
where
this
court
said
that
the
whole
system
of
our
law
is
based
on
the
fundamental
and
general
principle
of
the
equal
applicability
of
the
law.
that
is
what
this
case
is
about.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
thank
you.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
thank
you.
mr.
lee
has
said
that
in
his
view
parole
and
exclusion
are
legally
the
same
thing.
i
would
remind
him
that
his
brief
says
just
the
opposite.
his
brief
says
that
parole
is
not
a
legal
admission
into
the
united
states.
indeed,
that
is
exactly
what
congress
has
said
under
1182(d)(5).
they
are
separate,
and
they
are
separate
for
very
good
reasons.
a
temporary
release
of
somebody
from
parole
as
it
was
established
between
1954
and
1981
was
for
a
series
of
reasons
mostly
beneficial
to
the
government
in
terms
of
cost,
but
also,
as
this
court
said
in
leng
may
ma,
showing
the
enlightenment
of
our
society
in
temporarily
paroling
people
pending
a
determination
of
their
admission.
parole
does
not
grant
an
admission,
and
indeed
it
is
really
under
the
government's
control,
sole
control
as
to
how
fast
they
bring
an
alien
to
a
hearing
after
he
has
been
paroled.
it
is
up
to
the
government
to
decide
whether
or
not,
after
paroling
somebody
for
two
days,
whether
or
not
they
wish
to
give
them
an
exclusion
hearing,
or
two
months,
or
two
years,
but
they
are
not
the
same.
mr.
lee
cites
mandel
and
fiallo.
i
would
remind
him
that
even
where
congress
has
stated
and
even
where
congress
has
made
a
determination
as
to
admission,
it
was
reviewed
under
a
constitutional
standards.
mandel
implicated
clearly
the
question
of
admission
and
a
narrow
window
of
discretion
by
the
attorney
general
after
congress
had
spoken
clearly
on
an
exclusion.
fiallo
involved
an
act
of
congress,
and
even
there
it
was
reviewed
by
the
constitution.
the
government
would
attempt
here
to
extend
mezei
to
cover
the
issue
of
discrimination.
just
last
week,
this
court
in
united
states
versus
waite,
in
an
analogous
situation,
said,
even
though
questions
of
parole...
i
am
sorry.
even
though
questions
of
whether
or
not
to
prosecute
are
reviewable
only
under
the
most
narrow
standard,
and
may
in
fact
be
wholly
committed
to
agency
discretion,
even
those
questions
when
confronted
by
a
claim
of
discrimination
such
as
race
discrimination,
that
the
standard
is
different.
that
is
what
we
have
here.
this
is
not
a
case
where
you
would
apply
a
very
narrow
standard
because
it
implicates
admission.
here
the
standard,
because
it
is
a
question
of
race
discrimination,
as
this
court
found
just
last
week
in
united
states
versus
waite,
it
would
be
a
different
standard,
and
in
waite
justice
powell
said
that
equal
protection
under
the
fifth
amendment,
that
our
approach,
the
approach
of
this
court,
of
equal
protection
under
the
fifth
amendment
is
precisely
the
same
as
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
would
like
to
go
back
a
minute
on
the
question
of
remand,
because
i
think
there
is
some
confusion
here.
the
class
in
this
case
consists
of
1,700
petitioners
who
have
been
released
and
400
petitioners
who
are
presently
in
detention.
the
standard
on
remand
by
the
en
banc
court
gives
no
relief
whatsoever
to
the
1,700
petitioners
who
have
been
released.
to
the
400
petitioners
who
are
presently
in
detention,
it
provides
an
impermissibly
narrow
standard
in
the
context
of
race
and
nationality
discrimination.
it
applies
a
standard
of
facially
legitimate
and
bona
fide.
while
appropriate
in
the
context
of
fiallo
versus
bell
or
in
the
context
of
kleidienst
where
the
attorney
general
was
acting
just
as
in
waite,
it
is
inappropriate
in
the
context
of
race
and
nationality
discrimination.
we
seek
injunctive
relief
and
we
seek
declaratory
relief
because
this
case
arises
not
in
a
vacuum,
your
honor,
but
under
a
situation
of
a
continuing
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination.
this
is
not
an
isolated
case.
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrated
through
the
testimony
of
two
former
general
counsels
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
through
the
testimony
of
immigration
lawyers,
through
the
government's
own
documents,
that
this
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination
has
continued
for
a
period
of
ten
years.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
i
interpret
the
en
banc
court
as
merely
paying
lip
service,
your
honor,
because
they--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--lip
service
to
the
question
of
race
and
nationality
discrimination,
because
while
making
a
broad
holding
on
the
constitutional
grounds,
then
gave
a
very
narrow
standard
of
review,
the
facially
legitimate
and
bona
fide
standard,
and
under
that
standard
mere
protestation
of
innocence,
for
example,
may
be
enough.
this
court
has
said
when
it
comes
to
the
facially
legitimate
and
bona
fide
standard
that
we
will
not
look
behind
the
exercise
of
discretion.
just
from
a
practical
point
of
how
we
would
prove
a
discrimination
case
on
remand,
from
a
very
practical
point,
we
cannot
look
behind
that
exercise
of
discretion.
if
immigration
officials
on
remand
were
to
say,
well,
we
did
this
because
we
did
not
discriminate,
or
we
did
this
because
we
believed
that
there
was
some
deterrent,
under
the
standard
enunciated
in
kleindienst
versus
mandel,
which
are
appropriate
when
the
attorney
general
may
act
or
appropriate
when
congress
may
pass
a
law,
would
prevent
us
here
from
actually
going
back
and
proving
in
a
record
through
discovery
that
discrimination
still
exists.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all,
because
the
en
banc
court
also
vacated
the
injunction
that
prevented
the
government
from
redetaining
the
1,700
haitians
who
have
been
released.
the
government
is
free
now,
and
if
the
court--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--no,
the
hearing
on
remand
is
constituted
by
the
eleventh
circuit,
made
it
very
clear
that
it
only
pertains,
only
pertains
to
the
400
people
who
are
in
detention.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
some...
most
are,
but
some
aren't.
some
are
redetained.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
those
400
and
the
1,700
are
all
members
of
the
class.
thank
you.
