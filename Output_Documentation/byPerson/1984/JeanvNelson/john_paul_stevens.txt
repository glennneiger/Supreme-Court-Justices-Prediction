justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other...
what
if
you've
got
an
injunction
that
said,
obey
the
regulations
as
they
now
exist?
would
that
give
your
people
adequate
protection?
justice
stevens
no,
i
just
said...
the
injunction
doesn't
mention
the
constitution,
but
says,
you
know,
under
pain
of
contempt
and
all
the
rest,
you
are
hereby
enjoined
to
obey
the
regulations
that
are
now
in
effect.
justice
stevens
well,
then,
say
you
can't
use
the
impermissible
criteria
of
race
because
the
regulations
forbid
you
from
using
it.
would
that
give
you
all
the
protection
you
need?
justice
stevens
but
does
it
give
you
the
moral
statement
you
want?
i
guess
that
is
the--
justice
stevens
--what
if
we
added
to
that
a
statement
saying
the
eleventh
circuit
reached
a
constitutional
question
it
never
should
have
reached,
took
the
view
of
the
concurrence
and
dissent,
but
entered
an
injunction
saying
obey
the
regulation?
would
that
not
give
you
everything
you
want?
justice
stevens
under
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
regulation.
just
obey
the
regulation.
justice
stevens
my
question
didn't...
say
we
vacate
everything
they
did,
and
we
say,
this
is
the
injunction
to
enter.
obey
these
regulations.
tell
the
district
court
to
enter
an
injunction
to
obey
these
regulations.
wouldn't
that
give
you
all
the
relief
you
want?
and
we
vacate
everything...
i
am
not
suggesting
we
do
this,
but
i
am
trying
to
get
the
question
out.
would
not
that
protect
you
if
we
did
that?
justice
stevens
it
would
say
nothing
about
the
answer
to
the
constitutional
question,
on
the
theory
that
we
don't
answer
constitutional
questions
unless
we
have
to.
justice
stevens
general
lee,
before
you
get
into
the
main
part
of
your
argument,
i
am
still
puzzled
by
part
of
the
en
banc
court's
disposition,
which,
as
i
read
page
330
of
this
appendix,
it
contemplates
a
remand
to
the
district
court
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
people
in
detention
are
properly
detained,
and
as
a
part
of
that
determination
to
decide
whether
there
is
any
discrimination
going
on.
why
did
they
do
that?
justice
stevens
doesn't
that
imply
an
unwillingness
to
accept
at
face
value
the
finding
of
no
discrimination?
justice
stevens
are
the
post-judgment
arrivals
the
400
people--
justice
stevens
--who
are
now
in
detention?
justice
stevens
would
you
agree
as
to
those
400
people
that
on
remand
it
is
appropriate
to
determine
whether
they
are
the
victims
of
any
improper
discrimination?
justice
stevens
so
you
don't
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stevens
we
shouldn't
affirm
something
we
don't
understand.

justice
stevens
well,
but
the
whole
case,
whether
there
is
discrimination
going
on
as
to
these
400
people.
that
is
not
a
tag
end.
justice
stevens
general
lee,
i
hate
to
interrupt
again.
justice
stevens
this
keeps
running
through
my
mind.
justice
stevens
you
are
arguing
that
constitutionally
you
would
not
be
inhibited
from
discriminating
against
these
people
on
whatever
ground
seems
appropriate.
but
as
i
understand
your
regulations,
you
are
also
maintaining
that
the
regulations
do
not
constitute
any
kind
of
discrimination
against
these
people,
and
you
are
already...
your
agents
in
the
field
are
inhibited
by
your
own
regulations
from
doing
what
you
say
the
constitution
would
permit
you
to
do.
justice
stevens
why
isn't
that
the
complete
answer
to
the
government's
position?
i
mean,
why
do
we
have
to
go...
if
you
already
are
saying
we
are
forbidden
by
law,
not
constitutionally,
from
discriminating,
why
do
we
have
to
go
ahead
and
decide
whether
the
constitution
imposes
a
problem?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
thank
you.
justice
stevens
general
lee,
can
i
ask
a
question
prompted
by
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier?
i
think
you
have
agreed
that
there
is
constitutional
protection
to
the
conditions
of
detention
in
the
eighth
amendment,
for
example.
justice
stevens
does
that
mean
that
there
will
be
constitutional
protection
to
different...
choice
among
different
alternatives?
we
talked
about
parole
versus
detention.
i
suppose
there
are
different
degrees
of
detention,
different
kinds
of
parole,
and
so
forth.
are
all
of
the
decisions
that
are
made
regarding
the
person's
fate
so
long
as
they
don't
violate
the
eighth
amendment
completely
immune
from
constitutional--
justice
stevens
--whether
or
not
he
can
be
totally
excluded.
justice
stevens
but
the
decision
to
parole
or
to
detain
doesn't
really
affect
the
decision
whether
to
let
him
in
or
not.
justice
stevens
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
about
the
difference
between
solitary
confinement
and
general
population
of
the
prison?
justice
stevens
mr.
kurzban,
the
district
court
found
otherwise,
and
the
en
banc
court
remanded
for
findings
on
whether
there
was
discrimination.
how
do
you
interpret
the
en
banc
court's
finding...
remand?
justice
stevens
lip
service
to
what?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
if
you
view
this
as
related
just
to
the
400
subsequent
arrivals?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
the
hearing
on
remand
will
encompass
everybody?
justice
stevens
and
are
they
all
subsequent
arrivals?
justice
stevens
i
see.
and
they
are
all
members
of
the
class?
