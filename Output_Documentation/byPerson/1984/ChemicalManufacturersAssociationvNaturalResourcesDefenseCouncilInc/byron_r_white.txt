what
does
it
say?
it
doesn't
speak...
does
it
speak
of
a
variance?
justice
white
it
includes
a
variance.
justice
white
what
else
does
it
prohibit,
other
than
variances?
justice
white
do
you
think
they
could
amend
the
standard?
justice
white
so
that
301(l)
doesn't
mean
what
it
says.
justice
white
the
word
307
permits,
is
that
right?
justice
white
"modify",
that
is
a
strange
word
to
use
just
to
apply
to
variances.
justice
white
so
it
does
permit
the
changes
of
standards.
justice
white
do
you
think,
then,
that
a
variance...
you
just
don't
accept
that
a
variance
could
be
a
revision
of
a
standard.
justice
white
what
if
anybody
who
is
in
a
similar
situation
to
the
person
who
gets
the
variance,
would
also
get
a
variance.
what
if
they
were
to
give
a
variance
to
everyone
who
was
in
the
position
as
the
first
person
who
got
a
variance;
isn't
that
equivalent
to
a
revision
of
the
standard?
in
other
words,
a
group
variance.
certainly
that
is
what
the
government
argues.
justice
white
they
must
believe
they
would
give
a
variance
to
everybody
else
who
is
in
the
same
situation.
justice
white
yes,
but
that
kind
of
a
variance
is
based
on
what
they
claim
to
be
a
mistake.
there
were
some
factors
that
they
hadn't
considered,
and
if
those
factors
are
present
anywhere
else,
i
suppose,
they
would
recognize
those
factors
with
respect
to
other
people.
justice
white
so
you
would
say...
you
would
say
that
surely
under
307,
the
government
could
say
to
itself:
well,
this
person
has
applied
for
a
variance
and
has
claimed
that
there
were
factors
we
didn't
take
into
consideration.
we
made
a
mistake.
so
we
ought
to
make
a
subcategory
under
the
standard
and
say,
under
307,
we
are
going
to
publish
a
new
standard
and
say,
for
this
category
of
sources,
the
following
is
the
standard.
justice
white
but
it
shouldn't
go
about
it
by
purporting
to
issue
a
variance.
justice
white
or
that
it
needed
to
be
tailored,
or
it
needed
to
recognize
some
subgroups.
justice
white
ms.
dubrowski,
what
do
you
think...
what
do
you
suggest
the
standard
should
be,
that
we
should
apply
in
this
situation
where
the
agency
has
construed
the
statute
in
a
way
that
you
think
is
wrong.
should
we
independently
decide
whether
it's
wrong,
or
should
we
give
some
deference
or
should
we
ask...
what
questions
should
we
ask?
is
it
a
rational
construction
of
the
statute
even
though
not
the
best
one,
or
what?
justice
white
now,
how
about
my
question,
what
questions
should
we
ask?
is
this
a
rational
construction
of
the
statute
or
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute,
or
what,
or
just
the
best
one?
justice
white
if
it
is
clear
like
you
say
it
is,
any
other
construction
would
just
be
irrational,
wouldn't
it.
it
just
wouldn't
be
permissible.
justice
white
so
is
that
our
question
that
we
should
ask?
justice
white
well,
here
the
agency
is
pressing
a
construction
of
the
statute,
and
what
should
we
do,
say,
well,
we
think
there
is
a
better
construction
of
it,
or
should
we
say,
or
should
we
ask,
is
this
a
permissible
construction,
a
rational
construction,
even
though
there
are
other
constructions.
you
say
there
is
no
other
construction
than
yours,
i
take
it.
justice
white
of
course,
the
agency,
certainly
and
obviously,
has
not
agreed
with
you
for
some
time,
and
neither
does
the
solicitor
general.
they
think
there
is
another
permissible
construction
of
the
statute,
other
than
yours.
