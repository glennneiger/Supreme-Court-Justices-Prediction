mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
under
the
clean
water
act,
and
it
concerns
the
environmental
protection
agency's
authority
to
issue
what
are
known
as
fundamentally
different
factors
or
fdf
variances
from
its
effluent
limitations
and
standards
for
toxic
pollutants.
let
me
begin
by
briefly
describing
how
these
effluent
limitations
are
set
and
the
important
role
that
fdf
variances
play
in
the
process.
an
effluent
limitation
is
simply
a
figure
that
tells
a
facility
how
much
of
a
particular
pollutant
it
is
permitted
to
discharge.
these
are
usually
expressed
in
pounds
or
kilos
of
pollutants
per
1,000
pounds
of
product.
for
example,
one
pound
of
pollutant
per
1,000
pounds
of
steel,
plastic,
or
whatever.
there
are
separate
sets
of
effluent
limitations
for
what
are
known
as
direct
dischargers,
facilities
that
discharge
their
wastes
directly
into
the
navigable
waters,
and
indirect
dischargers,
facilities
that
discharge
into
public
treatment
works.
this
case
concerns
indirect
dischargers,
but
the
basic
arguments
are
the
same
in
both
the
direct
and
indirect
discharger
contexts.
direct
dischargers
were
required
to
meet
two
sets
of
effluent
limitations.
by
1977,
they
were
required
to
meet
the
effluent
limitations
associated
with
what
is
known
as
bpt,
the
best
practicable
control
technology
currently
available,
and
between
1984
and
1987,
depending
on
the
type
of
pollutant,
they
are
required
to
satisfy
the
stricter
standards
of
what
is
known
as
the
at,
the
best
available
technology
economically
achievable.
indirect
dischargers
have
similar
requirements
called
pre-treatment
standards.
effluent
limitations
are
set
on
what
is
known
as
a
categorical
basis,
that
is
by
industrial
category
and
subcategory.
epa
has
identified
those
categories
of
industry
where
pollution
control
is
most
urgently
needed,
and
it
has
taken
the
larger
categories
and
further
sliced
them
into
numerous
subcategories,
some
fairly
broad
and
some
quite
narrow.
in
fact,
some
of
these
subcategories
have
included
as
few
as
one
or
two
facilities.
the
clean
water
act
itself
does
not
set
any
of
these
effluent
limitations
or
standards.
that
is
epa's
job
using
factors
that
are
generally
set
out
in
the
act.
for
example,
some
of
the
factors
that
are
used
for
bat
and
for
pre-treatment
include
the
age
of
facilities
and
equipment
involved,
the
energy
requirements
of
different
types
of
pollution
control
technology,
the
different
manufacturing
processes
that
may
be
used,
and
the
cost
of
achieving
effluent
reduction.
let
me
give
an
example
using
the
factor
of
cost
to
which
i
may
return
later
in
the
argument.
epa
may
determine
that
for
a
particular
subcategory
there
is
a
new
advanced
form
of
pollution
control
technology
that
will
cost
between,
let's
say,
between
three-quarters
of
a
million
and
one
million
dollars
per
facility
to
install,
and
epa
may
find
that
a
cost
of
one
million
dollars
per
plant
is
economically
achievable,
so
epa
may
conclude
that
for
this
subcategory,
this
technology
represents
bat.
it
is
the
best
available
technology
economically
achievable.
gathering
information
on
all
of
the
relevant
factors
in
making
these
determinations
for
all
of
these
categories
and
all
of
these
subcategories
is
an
enormous
task.
just
in
the
indirect
discharger
category
there
are
more
than
30...
there
are
more
than
60,000
facilities
in
the
34
primary
industrial
categories,
and
epa
was
supposed
to
go
about
this
work
at
a
really
breathtaking
pace.
under
the
act,
epa
was
given
180
days
to
proposed
the
pre-treatment
standards
for
all
of
american
industry.
epa
has
not
been
able
to
meet
these
impossible
deadlines
and
as
a
result
respondent
has
had
law
suits
pending
against
the
agency
for
the
past
decade,
seeking
to
compel
the
agency
to
move
more
quickly.
epa's
only
hope
of
issuing
effluent
limitations
on
a
reasonably
expeditious
basis
has
been
to
concentrate
on
the
typical
plants
during
the
rulemaking
phase,
and
not
on
the
atypical
ones,
and
consequently
one
of
epa's
problems
has
been
these
unusual
plants.
these
may
be
older.
they
may
use
different
manufacturing
processes.
their
energy
costs
may
be
different
because
of
location,
or
some
other
factor.
let
me
return
to
my
example
where
bat
was
calculated
to
cost
between
three-quarter
of
a
million
and
a
million
dollars
for
a
facility.
for
one
of
these
unusual
plants,
the
cost
may
be
two
million
dollars,
far
beyond
what
is
economically
achievable
for
any
of
the
facilities
in
that
subcategory.
how
is
epa
supposed
to
deal
with
this
problem
of
the
unusual
plant?
one
solution,
and
this
is
one
that
respondent
recommends
in
his
brief,
would
be
for
epa
simply
to
withhold
issuing
its
categorical
limitations
until
it
has
tracked
down
every
single
facility
and
every
single
subcategory
of
the
category
under
consideration,
and
has
determined
that...
what
the
requirements
and
factors
are
for
that
facility.
this
may
be
theoretically
possible,
but
it
would
certainly
delay
the
issuance
of
the
categorical
limitations
and
that
would
not
serve
the
purposes
of
the
clean
water
act.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor,
and
that
is
essentially
what
we
believe
the
fdf
variance
mechanism
does.
respondent
argues
that--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--that
is
precisely
correct.
they
achieve
the
same
substance
in
that
they
would
be--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--based
on
the
concessions
that
i
perceive
in
respondent's
brief,
i
think
that's
what
the
issue
in
the
case
boils
down
to.
the
agency,
of
course,
argues
that
it
may
use
fdf
variances
for
all
pollutants.
respondent
says,
no,
at
least
in
the
case
of
toxics.
but
i
take
respondent
to
concede
that
epa
may
amend
its
effluent
limitations
regarding
toxic
pollutants
irrespective
of
the
language
of
301(l)
which
they
have
argued
categorically
prohibits
anything
that
may
be
termed
a
"modification".
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that's
correct,
but
if
i
take
respondent
to
have
made
in
one
part
of
its
brief
the
argument
that
301(l)
is
clear
on
its
face,
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
look
any
further,
and
i
think--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--an
fdf--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--no,
it
is
not
a
revision
within
the
meaning
of
307,
but
neither
is
the
modification
within
the
meaning
of
301(l).
the
other
concession
made
by
respondent
that
i
want
to
mention
was
their
concession
that
an
amendment
of
an
effluent
limitation
may
appropriately
create
a
subcategory
for
one
or
a
few
plants.
so
if
you
put
those
two
concessions
together,
i
take
them
to
concede
that
epa
may
do
essentially
what
it
is
doing
with
the
fdf
variance
mechanism,
but
it
has
to
do
it
by
a
different
procedure.
i
think
that
once
it
is
understood
that
this
is
what
the
dispute
in
the
case
boils
down
to,
then
the
agency's
position
surely
must
prevail,
because
an
agency
should
be
permitted
to
follow
the
procedure
that
it
prefers
unless
congress
has
dictated
another
procedure.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
during
the
testimony
in
the
house
during
this
session,
epa
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
third
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
should
be
overturned,
but
that
no--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i'm
not
aware
whether
that
occurred
or
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
my
understanding
was
that
no
specific
bill
containing
such
a
provision
had
been
proposed
and,
in
fact,
no
amendments
to
the
clean
water
act
were
adopted
by
this
session.
in
any
event,
whatever
this
congress
did,
i
certainly
don't
think
that
it's
possible
to
infer
an
intent
to
adopt
the
third
circuit's
decision.
in
any
event,
what
this
congress
intends
concerning
301(l)
is
a
poor
guide
to
the
intent
of
the
congress
that
adopted
301(l)
in
1977.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
it
stems
from
501
which
authorizes
the
agency
to
issue
regulations
necessary
to
implement
the
act,
and
i
think
it
stems
from
two
potentially
conflicting
statutory
commands
in
the
clean
water
act,
namely,
to
issue
these
limitations
on
a
categorical
basis,
and
then
to
do
it
based
on
factors
that
vary
significantly
among
seemingly
similar
plants.
there
is
tension
between
these
two
statutory
commands,
and
the
fdf
variance
mechanism,
i
think,
is
a
permissible
way
of
reconciling
that.
i
think
in
the
dupont
case,
this
court
recognized
that
the
fdf
variance
was
an
appropriate
and
perhaps
even
a
necessary
mechanism
in
the
bpt
context,
and
i
see
no
reason
to
draw
a
distinction
between
bpt
and
and
bat
in
pre-treatment
in
this
area.
the
statutory
authority
is
the
same,
and
epa's
practical
problem
is
the
same:
how
do
you
issue
defensible
categorical
regulations
on
a
reasonably
expeditious
basis,
while
taking
into
account
factors
that
may
vary
greatly
from
plant
to
plant.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
they
certainly
are
not.
at
the
heart
of
our
submission
is
that
those
statutory
modifications
are
very
different
from
the
fdf
variances.
that
congress
intended
301(l)
to
apply
exclusively
to
those
statutory
modifications,
and
did
not
intend
for
301(l)
to
apply
to
fdf
variances.
i
think
the
center
of
the
third
circuit's
misunderstanding
was
its
inability
to
understand
the
difference
between
those
statutory
modifications
and
fdf
variances.
what
the
fdf
variance
does
is
to
correct
a
mistake,
that's
all
that
it
does.
it
corrects
a
mistake.
it
establishes
the
kind
of
effluent
limitation
that
should
have
been
set
in
the
first
place.
the
statutory
modifications
do
something
very
different.
under
301(c)
a
facility
may
be
eligible
for
a
modification
if
it
can
show,
not
that
there
was
any
mistake
in
the
effluent
limitation,
but
that
it
can't
afford
compliance.
if
i
can
return
to
my
example
where
bat
was
calculated
to
cost
between
three-quarters
of
a
million
and
a
million
dollars,
if
a
plant
came
in
and
said,
"i
can't
comply
because
i
can't
afford
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars.
"
it
would
be
ineligible
for
an
fdf
variance,
but
it
might
be
eligible
for
a
301(c)
modification.
similarly,
under
section
301(g),
a
facility
may
be
eligible
for
a
modification
based
on
the
quality
of
the
water
into
which
it
is
making
its
discharge.
now
that
is
a
fact
that
epa
may
not
consider
in
setting
its
technology-base
effluent
limitations.
once
this
difference
between
statutory
modifications
and
fdf
variances
is
understood,
this
court
has
already
clearly
recognized
the
difference
and
explained
it
at
some
length
in
the
national
crushed
stone
case...
one
this
difference
is
understood,
then
i
think
it
becomes
apparent
what
congress
did
in
1977.
it
makes
perfect
sense
for
congress
to
have
said,
as
we
believe
it
did,
that
statutory
modifications
are
prohibited
for
toxic
pollutants,
but
that
fdf
variances
are
available
for
all
pollutants,
because
the
fdf
variance
just
corrects
a
mistake,
and
whether
that
mistake
has
to
do
with
a
toxic
pollutant,
or
any
other
pollutant,
it
should
be
corrected.
but
the
statutory
modification--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--yes.
if
epa
had
calculated
that
bat
for
a
subcategory
was
between
three
quarters
of
a
million
and
a
million
dollars,
and
a
plant
came
in
and
said,
"because
of
the
age
of
my
equipment.
"
let
us
say,
"my
cost
is
going
to
be
two
million
dollars,
and
that
is
beyond
the
economic
capability
of
anybody
or
group,
it
is
not
economically
achievable
for
the
group.
"
that
plant
might
be
eligible
for
an
fdf
variance.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
plant
came
in
and
said,
"i
know
you
calculated
the
cost
between
three
quarters
of
a
million
and
a
million
dollars,
and
i
can
see
that
that's
accurate,
but
i
can't
pay
even
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars,
or
i
will
go
out
of
business.
"
that
plant
is
ineligible
for
an
fdf
variance
because
it
would
not
have
shown
that
the
agency
did
not
consider
the
proper
range
of
factors,
only
that
the
individual
plant
was
economically
weak
and
could
not
afford
compliance.
i
think
that
is
the
distinction
congress
drew
in
1977.
what
the
statutory
modifications
do
is
not
to
correct
an
incorrect
effluent
limitation,
they
excuse
compliance
with
a
proper
limitation
based
on
factors
such
as
the
weak
economic
condition
of
a
particular
plant,
because
under
certain
circumstances,
those
factors
take
precedence,
but
congress
said,
when
it
comes
to
toxic
pollutants,
these
other
factors
must
take
a
backseat.
that
is
the
distinction
congress
drew,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we
think
congress
limited
301(l)
to
the
statutory
modifications
and
not
to
fdf
variances.
the
fdf
variance
has
been
a
device
that
epa
has
used
to
deal
with
this
problem
of
the
unusual,
and
it
has
worked
very
well.
it
has
allowed
the
agency
to
issue
its
regulations
more
quickly
than
would
otherwise
have
been
possible
if
it
had
to
stop
and
worry
about
every
unusual
facility
in
the
country.
it
has
helped
the
agency
to
defend
against
court
challenges
to
those
regulations
by
facilities
claiming
to
be
fundamentally
different.
it
has
been
specifically
cited
by
several
courts
of
appeal
in
turning
away
those
challenges,
and
it
has
not
been
necessary
to
use
this
safety
device
very
often,
which
speaks,
i
think,
to
the
accuracy
of
the
effluent
limitations.
the
issue
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
the
meaning
of
301(l),
which
prohibits
modifications
of
effluent
limitations
for
toxic
pollutants.
as
i
said,
epa's
position
has
always
been
that
this
is
limited
exclusively
to
statutory
modifications
under
301(c)
and
(g).
respondent
says
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
301(l).
respondent
says
that
a
modification
is
any
change
in
an
effluent
limitation
that
makes
the
effluent
limitation
more
lenient.
but
if
that
interpretation
were
correct,
then
what
would
happen
if
epa
issued
an
effluent
limitation
for
a
toxic
pollutant
and
then
discovered
that
its
analysis
was
mistaken,
or
circumstances
changed,
energy
costs
skyrocketed
for
example,
and
a
technology
that
was
previously
economically
achievable
became
unaffordable?
under
that
plain
meaning
argument,
epa
would
be
powerless
to
amend
its
own
rules,
and
that
can't
be
what
congress
intended.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
we
think
it
would,
justice
o'connor,
but
our
point
is
that
a
provision
that
prohibits
modifications
but
permits
revisions
is
not
a
provisions
that
is
clear
on
its
face,
and
it
is
necessary
to
take
into
account
the
interpretation
of
the
agency
with
expertise
under
this
act.
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
legislative
history.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
it
is
indeed
a
term
of
art
in
301(l).
congress
used
301(l)
in
the
same
way
that
it
used
301(c)
and
(g).
everything
in
the
legislative
history
supports
that.
there
is
the
evolution
of
301(l).
301(l)
derives
from
the
senate
bill.
there
wasn't
anything
comparable
in
the
house
bill.
in
the
senate,
however,
in
the
senate
bill,
there
was
not
a
separate
provision
like
301(l).
301(c)
was
amended
to
include
the
prohibition
against
that
particular
type
of
modification
for
toxic
pollutant,
and
similarly
there
was
a
prohibition
in
301(g)
which
was
a
new
provision
prohibiting
that
type
of
modification
for
a
toxic.
what
the
conference
committee
did
was
to
take
this
language
out
of
301(c)
and
(g)
and
create
a
new
section
301(l).
when
they
did
that,
they
did
not
provide
any
notice
to
their
colleagues
that
they
were
expanding
the
substance
of
each
of
those
provisions,
and
they
provided
no
explanation
for
the
change
which
suggests
to
us
that
the
change
was
intended
to
be
purely
stylistic.
there
is
also
what
congress
said
about
301(l),
and
admittedly
it
did
not
say
very
much,
but
almost
every
time
it
referred
to
it,
it
was
specifically
linked
with
301(c)
and
(g).
there
is
also
the
inference
that
we
believe
may
fairly
be
drawn
from
what
congress
did
not
say.
at
no
point
in
the
legislative
history
of
301(l)
did
any
member
of
congress
suggest
that
301(l)
was
intended
to
reach
epa's
well-established
and
well-known
practice
of
granting
fdf
variances.
if
any
member
of
congress
had
had
such
an
intent,
we
believe
that
they
would
have
said
something,
but
nobody
did.
respondent
says,
congress
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
epa
had
been
issuing
fdf
variances,
but
that
is
incorrect
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
epa
had
been
including
fdf
variance
provisions
in
its
bpt
regulations
for
some
time,
and
i
think
this
was
well
known
in
the
environmental
community.
respondent
says
that
congress
was
not
worried
about
bpt
in
1977,
it
had
put
it
out
of
its
mind,
but
bpt
was
going
to
remain
in
effect
for
seven
more
years.
so
that
seems
completely
implausible.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
there
were
variances
pertaining
to
pollutants
that
were
later
designated
by
congress
to
be
toxic.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
but
that
is
because
the
way
that
toxic
pollutants
were
handled
under
the
clean
water
act
was
radically
changed
in
1977.
before
1977,
i
believe
they
were
supposed
to
be
dealt
with
primarily
under
section
307,
which
is
a
separate
set
of
effluent
limitations
for
toxic
pollutants.
then
in
1977,
it
was
decided
that
they
would
be
dealt
with
primarily
through
the
regular
technology-based
effluent
limitations
that
are
issued
under
301.
those
effluent
limitations
had
been
issued.
there
had
been
fdf
variances
from
those
limitations
for
pollutants
that
were
later
designated
as
toxic
pollutants,
and
the
pollutants
to
which
301(l)
applies
are
those
on
a
list
that
was
included
in
a
consent
degree
between
nrdc
and
the
government
prior
to
the
1977
amendments.
it
is
now
referred
to
in
section
307
of
the
act,
and
those
pollutants,
there
are
65
of
them,
are
set
out
in
a
provision
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
returning
to
my
argument
that
respondent
maintains
that
congress
was
not
aware
of
epa's
practice
of
granting
fdf
variances,
i
think
the
thing
that
really
refutes
that
argument
is
this
court's
decision
in
dupont,
which
occurred
in
early
1977,
and
the
clear
water
act
was
enacted
in
late
1977.
dupont
referred
prominently
to
fdf
variances.
this
was
pivotal
case
under
the
act,
and
i
think
the
members
of
congress,
and
surely
the
congressional
staff
members
who
were
concerned
with
the
clean
water
act
amendments
of
1977
must
have
been
aware
of
the
fdf
variance
mechanism.
if
anybody
had
any
intent
of
restricting
epa's
practice
of
granting
those
fdf
variances,
i
think
someone
would
have
said
something
but,
as
i
mentioned,
no
one
did.
it
is
also
important
to
realize
that
granting
an
fdf
variance
for
a
toxic
pollutant
is
completely
consistent
with
congress's
intent
in
1977
to
take
strong
measures
against
toxic
pollutants
because,
as
i
said,
all
an
fdf
variance
does
is
to
correct
a
mistake.
it
just
establishes
the
kind
of
effluent
limitation
that
should
have
been
set
in
the
first
place.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
have
no
rebuttal.
