justice
stevens
mr.
alito,
may
i
just
ask
one
clarifying
question.
when
you're
dealing
with
variances,
the
fdf
variances
outside
of
the
toxic
area,
just
in
the
regular
area,
what
is
the
statutory
source
of
the
agency's
authority
to
grant
such
variances?
justice
stevens
are...
sections
301(c)
and
301(g),
they're
not
sources
of
authority,
right?
justice
stevens
can
you
help
me
once
more.
you
said,
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
follow
this,
a
correcting
mistake
variance
rather
than
a
statutory
301(c).
would
you
give
me
an
example,
again,
i
think
you
did,
but
i
didn't
quite
follow
it,
one
that
would
be
a
mistake
correction,
but
would
not
qualify
under
301(c)?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
once
more,
mr.
alito?
had
they
talked
about
the
variance
practice
that
had
been
in
effect
at
the
time
of
these
amendments?
were
the
variances
pertaining
to
toxic
pollutants
that
were
well
established?
justice
stevens
were
there
variances
with
respect
to
pollutants
that
had
been
designated
as
toxic
pollutants
at
the
time
the
variance
was
granted?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
there.
have
you
finished
your
answer?
if
you
haven't,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
justice
stevens
i
just
would
like
to
know
whether
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
there
was
statutory
authority
for
variances
in
the
non-toxic
area,
and
that
the
statutory
authority
is
what
he
described,
namely,
501
and
of
the
general
scheme
of
the
act.
justice
stevens
is
it
part
of
your
position,
then,
that
before...
was
301(c)
part
of
the
'77
amendments?
justice
stevens
so
your
position
is
that
variances
in
the
non-toxic
area
all
had
to
be
pursuant
to
301(c)
or
301(g)?
justice
stevens
if
that
were
true,
then
the
prohibition
would
have
cut
them
out
in
the
toxic
area.
justice
stevens
so
you
disagree
with
your
opponent's
reading
of
what
the
basic
statutory
for
any
variance
was
before
'77?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
which
was
prompted
by
what
justice
white
asked
you,
the
extent
to
which
we
should
give
deference
to
the
agency's
construction
of
the
statute.
this
is
unlike
chevron,
if
i
get
the
history
right
here,
in
that
the
agency
has
had
this
construction
of
the
statute
through
the
change
of
administration.
there
is,
i
think,
this
section
403.13
that
was
in
effect
in
1978,
was
it,
and
then
it
was
not
changed
when
the
new--
justice
stevens
--at
least,
we
have
a
consistent
agency
interpretation
of
the
act.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
agency
in
'78,
and
the
agency
since
1980
has
taken
the
same
view
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
