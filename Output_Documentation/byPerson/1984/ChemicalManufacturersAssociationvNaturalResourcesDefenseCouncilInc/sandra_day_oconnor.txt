justice
o'connor
suppose
regulations
could
be
issued
and
then
amended
to
care
of
refinements
as
time
went
on,
could
they
not?
justice
o'connor
it
accomplishes
the
same
goal,
but
i
suppose
not
with
the
same
procedural
accoutrements
that
a
regulatory
change
would
encompass.
justice
o'connor
is
that
what
we
are
really
concerned
about
here
as
to
whether
the
epa
should
have
to
follow
the
regulatory
procedural
requirements
and
adopted
regulations
versus
issuance
of
individual--
justice
o'connor
--well,
307
permits
a
revision,
does
it
not?
justice
o'connor
does
epa
claim
that
an
fdf
variance
is
a
revision--
justice
o'connor
--under
the
meaning
of
307?
justice
o'connor
mr.
alito,
has
the
agency
requested
the
appropriate
congressional
committee
to
draft
an
amendment
to
section
301
to
take
care
of
the
problem
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
did
it
go
further
and
offer
specific
language
by
epa
to
the
committee
to
take
care
of
this
problem?
justice
o'connor
it
was
my
understanding
that
it
had.
justice
o'connor
would
that
trigger
the
revision
of
section
307,
mr.
alito?
justice
o'connor
you
think
the
word
"modify"
is
a
term
of
art
requiring
agency
expertise
to
define
it?
justice
o'connor
for
toxic
pollutants.
justice
o'connor
right--
justice
o'connor
--ms.
dubrowski,
this
case,
of
course,
involves
bat
standards.
justice
o'connor
would
you
say
that
epa
is
barred
under
301(l)
from
granting
fdf
variances
for
bpt
toxic
effluent
guidelines?
justice
o'connor
i
understand
that
it
is
phasing
out,
but
i
want
to
know
what
your
view
is.
justice
o'connor
how
do
you
square
that
with
the
language
this
court
used
in
the
dupont
decision?
