ms.
frances
dubrowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
is
a
very
straightforward
one.
can
epa
grant
variances
from
national
pre-treatment
standards
for
toxic
pollutants?
congress
amended
the
clean
water
act
in
1977
to
strengthen
epa's
ability
to
regulate
toxics.
it
identified
bat
and
pre-treatment
standards
as
the
key
elements
of
a
toxic
control
strategy.
it
carefully
considered
when
and
under
what
conditions
epa
could
grant
variances
from
these
standards,
and
each
time
it
considered
the
idea
of
a
variance
for
toxics,
it
rejected
it.
at
the
same
time,
congress
enacted
301(1)
of
the
law,
which
tells
epa
in
broad
and
unqualified
language
not
to
modify
any
bat
for
pre-treatment
standard
for
toxics.
epa
urges
this
court
to
take
a
very
narrow
reading
of
301(l).
epa
says
that
the
broad
ban
on
variances
in
that
section
was
intended
to
apply
to
the
statutory
variances
from
bat
that
congress
had
created.
in
other
words,
the
economic
capability
variance
in
section
301(c)
of
the
law,
or
the
water
quality
variance
in
section
301(g).
congress,
says
epa,
did
not
mean
to
cut
off
any
implied
authority
that
epa
might
have
at
some
future
time
to
creates
administrative
variances
from
bat
for
pre-treatment.
of
course,
if
congress
had
this
very
narrow
purpose
in
mind,
it
would
have
had
no
reason
to
create
301(l).
both
301(c)
and
what
became
301(g)
in
the
senate
bill
already
contained
provisos
limiting
their
applicability
to
non-toxics.
epa
says
that
when
the
conference
moved
the
ban
on
variances
out
of
section
301(c)
and
into
a
separate
subsection,
it
did
so
for
purely
stylistic
reasons.
not
substitute
change
was
intended,
it
simply
reflected
the
drafters'
desire
to
put
the
words
in
the
statute
somewhere
else.
but
epa's
analysis
is
plainly
wrong,
because
congress
did
not
simply
move
the
words,
it
changed
them
to
reaffirm
the
intent
that
we
maintain
here.
the
original
ban
on
variances
had
said,
don't
modify
any
requirement
of
301(b)(2)(a),
in
other
words,
don't
modify
a
bat
or
pre-treatment
standard.
the
new
subsection
(1)
said,
don't
modify
any
requirement
of
301.
it
included
within
its
scope
not
only
pre-treatment
and
bat
standards,
but
the
more
stringent
toxic
effluent
standards
that
were
not
technology
based.
in
addition,
congress
moved
subsection
(1)
out
of
the
sections
of
the
conference
bill
that
were
entitled
"waivers",
or
"modifications",
and
into
a
section
of
the
conference
bill
that
was
entitled
"toxic
pollutants".
the
latter
section
identified
for
the
first
time
the
toxics
of
concern
to
congress,
and
told
epa
to
regulate
those
quickly.
in
other
words,
congress
deliberately
wrote
301(l)
as
a
comprehensive
ban
on
variances.
it
wanted
to
curtail
all
variances.
it
did
not
simply
mean
to
plus
the
loophole
that
had
been
created
in
301(c)
and
301(g)
of
the
law.
ignoring
this
evolution
of
301(l),
epa
argues,
that
if
congress
wanted
to
cut
off
other
variances,
it
must
have
believed
that
there
were
such
other
variances,
and
if
so,
it
is
odd
that
congress
didn't
mention
them.
so
epa
searches
for
legislative
history
to
reference
the
fdf.
in
coming
up
empty-handed,
it
says,
that
search
is
dispositive.
this
analysis
begs
the
question.
the
broad
language
of
301(l)
prohibits
all
variances.
it
isn't
necessary
for
congress
to
have
had
the
fdf
variance
in
mind
to
curtail
it.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
it
says,
do
not
modify
any
requirement
of
section
301,
and
the
term
301,
means
the
variance.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
it
includes
the
variance,
yes.
congress
uses
the
term--
ms.
frances
dubrowski
--i
think
it
is
limited
to
variances.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
that's
right.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
there
is
a
provision
in
section
307
to
revise
standards
from
time
to
time.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
no,
301(l)
means
modification,
i.e.,
variance.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
the
word
"modify"
in
this
context
means
variance,
it
does
not
mean
revision.
the
same
problem
arises
with
the
new
source
standards.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
congress
used
to
encompass
waivers
and
variances.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
it
does
permit
epa
to
revise
the
standard
from
to
time,
yes,
it
does.
the
same
question
comes
up
in
the
context
of
new
source
standards.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
a
variance,
as
the
fdf
variances,
is
an
attempt
to
relax
pollution
control
requirements
for
a
single
source,
and
that
is
what
301(l)
prohibits.
that
is
different
from
revising
the
requirements
for
the
entire
category
of
sources.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
yes,
they
argue
that
you
can...
they
argue
that
the
fdf
variance
is
a
tailoring
to
an
individual
source.
it
is
not
a
group
variance.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
the
fdf
variance
doesn't
contemplate
looking
at
the
group
as
a
whole.
it
says,
consider...
in
the
argument
that
epa
has
used
here
today,
the
example,
consider
a
source
and
determine
whether
that
source's
pollution
control
requirements
are
out
of
proportion
to
the
group
as
a
whole,
and
if
so,
you
can
get
a
variance.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
there
is
a
difference
between
a
variance
that
is
an
individual
tailoring
of
a
standard,
and
a
revision
that
considers
the
category
as
a
whole.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
epa
would
have
the
authority,
if
it
had
information--
ms.
frances
dubrowski
--if
epa
had
information
that
the
standard
as
a
whole
was
wrong,
it
could
change
it.
there
is
a
difference
between
saying
that--
ms.
frances
dubrowski
--congress
told
epa
to
set
these
standard
across
classes.
it
told
epa
expressly
to
avoid
single
plant
determinations.
you
cannot
use
the
revision
authority
to
do
what
you
couldn't
do
in
the
rulemaking
anyway.
you
couldn't
use
the
revision
to
set
up
a
case
by
case,
plant
by
plant
decision-making
the
way
the
fdf
variance
does
because
that
is
what
congress
said
do
not
do.
furthermore,
if
you
use
the...
whatever
mechanism
you
use,
the
question
that
arises
is,
is
this
the
maximum
technology
that
is
affordable
for
this
source,
because
that
is
the
bat
standard,
and
the
pre-treatment
standards
are
supposed
to
be
set
equal
to
bat.
bat
in
the
statute
asks
those
questions--
the
fdf
variance,
as
epa
has
written
it,
does
not
look
at
the
question
of
affordability.
it
looks
only
to
costs,
and
if
your
costs
are
out
of
proportion
to
someone
else's,
you
would
get
a
variance.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
that
is
not
what
congress
intended.
congress
didn't
say,
are
you
costs
higher.
congress
said,
this
is
the
best
technology
achievable
for
the
class
as
a
whole.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
that's
right.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
we
would
say
that
epa
is,
although
i
should
point
out
that
that
question
is
at
this
point
legally
irrelevant.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
we
would
say,
yes,
301(l)
would
apply
to
bpt.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
301(l)
was
enacted
after
dupont,
it
changes
the
law.
epa
says,
dupont
should
be
read
to
cover
bat
and
pre-treatment,
a
reading
of
dupont
which
we
don't
think
is
supported.
but,
in
any
evert,
whatever
authority
epa
had,
301(l)
is
written
broadly
enough
to
curtail
those
variances.
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
question
of
how
is
this
different
from
happened
in
a
rulemaking.
this
court
said
in
national
crushed
stone
that
the
fdf
variance
does
precisely
what
section
301(c)
variance
does,
that
is,
it
takes
the
statutory
criteria
for
the
category
as
a
whole
and
it
tailors
it
to
an
individual
source.
the
questions
that
you
ask
in
a
bpt
variance
proceeding,
as
opposed
to
in
a
301(c)
variance,
are
different
because
bpt
and
bat
are
different.
if
epa
were
to
reword
its
fdf
variance
so
that
it
did
encompass
the
tests
that
it
is
supposed
to,
the
bat
tests,
they
would
have
to
ask
the
question:
is
this
the
maximum
technology
achievable
for
this
source?
that
is
the
precise
question
that
301(c)
asks,
and
epa
concedes
that
301(l)
bars
that
question.
301(l),
therefore,
bars
asking
the
same
question
under
the
name
of
an
fdf
variance.
that
is
why
the
third
circuit
said,
these
two
variances
serve
the
same
function.
it
makes
no
sense
to
assume
that
congress
prohibited
one
and
not
the
other
for
toxics.
there
are
other
differences
between
subcategorization
during
a
rulemaking
and
a
revision
after.
one
very
critical
difference
is
that
a
revision
afterwards
takes
place
in
the
context
of
a
statutory
compliance
deadline.
congress
said
that
sources
had
only
three
years
from
the
date
the
standards
were
issued
to
come
into
compliance.
in
that
sense,
pre-treatment
is
different
from
bpt
and
bat.
there
is
no
permit
mechanism
here.
there
is
no
mechanism
to
tailor
these
standards
to
individual
plants.
sources
don't
have
the
luxury
of
waiting
for
that
permit,
they
must
comply
automatically
with
that
standard
once
it
is
issued.
the
fdf
variance
is
anti-factidal
to
that
statutory
scheme
because
it
takes
epa
seven
or
eight
years
to
decide
these
variance
applications.
if
it
takes
seven
or
eight
years,
you
can't
meet
a
three
year
compliance
deadline.
also
during
the
rulemaking,
epa
cannot
categorize
sources
on
the
basis
of
cost,
the
way
it
purports
to
do
in
an
fdf
variance.
all
sources
must
come
up
to
the
level
of
the
best
performer,
that
means
that
some
sources
will
have
higher
costs
than
others.
congress
anticipated
that,
and
it
was
envisioned
in
bat
that
that
would
happen.
if
you
could
subcategorize
on
the
basis
of
cost,
you
wouldn't
need
a
301(c)
variance,
you
wouldn't
need
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
fact
that
sources
might
close,
or
that
everyone
had
to
come
up
to
the
level
of
the
best
performer
because
the
subcategorization
would
take
care
of
that.
epa
cannot
subcategorize
on
the
basis
of
cost
as
the
fdf
variance
would
allow
it
to
do.
it
must,
for
each
source,
brings
that
source
up
to
the
level
achievable
across
the
category
as
a
whole.
the
new
sources
standards
in
the
act
are
not
subject
to
variances
as
this
court
held
in
dupont.
those
standards
can
be
revised
from
time
to
time
to
reflect
new
developments
in
technology.
in
fact,
congress
used
the
same
language
to
tell
epa
to
revise
new
source
standards
as
it
did
to
tell
epa
to
revise
the
pre-treatment
standards.
so
the
ability
of
epa
to
revise
the
standards
does
not
in
any
way
interfere
or
conflict
with
their
duty
to
prevent
case
by
case
decision-making,
plant
by
plant
tailoring
of
the
standards
to
individual
sources,
especially
after
the
rulemaking,
when
the
compliance
set
time
is
running.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
a
moment
to
the
legislative
history
because
the
legislative
history
here
is
very
clear.
senator
muskie
said,
there
are
no
waivers
or
modifications
for
toxics,
a
statement
that
was
also
made
in
the
senate
committee
report.
senator
muskie
is
the
principal
author
of
the
1977
amendments
on
toxics.
likewise,
congressman
roberts,
the
house
floor
manager,
referring
to
the
very
portion
of
the
conference
bill
that
contained
301(l),
said,
"strict
requirements
are
in
effect
for
damaging
pollutants
such
as
toxics.
"
"for
certain
other
pollutants,
industry
may
get
a
waiver.
"
in
fact,
one
house
member
said,
"listing
all
these
substances,
and
denying
any
waiver
with
respect
to
these
substances
at
all,
may
lead
to
new
regulations
more
stringent
than
any
previously
contemplated.
"
epa
cannot
point
to
a
single
sentence
in
the
legislative
history
which
supports
its
reading,
its
authority
to
grant
these
variances.
instead,
epa
tries
to
dismiss
all
the
statements
which
run
the
other
way.
epa
says,
those
statements
were
made
in
the
context
of
301(c)
or
301(g)
of
the
law.
epa
is
wrong.
the
statement
that
i
quoted
from
congressman
roberts
discusses
section
53
of
the
conference
bill,
which
contains
301(l).
senator
muskie's
statement
that
there
could
be
no
waivers
or
modifications
takes
place
in
the
context
of
a
floor
statement
entitled,
bat>
["].
it
is
true
that
senator
muskie
mentions
only
the
301(c)
and
the
301(g)
variance,
but
that
is
because
they
were
the
only
identifiable
variances
at
that
time.
in
1977,
epa
had
a
well
established
practice
of
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
bpt
standards
on
the
one
hand
for
which
it
had
fdf
variances,
and
the
bat
and
pre-treatment
standards
for
which
it
did
not
have
such
variances.
so
epa's
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
hinges
on
a
single
word,
when
congressman
roberts
said,
in
another
statement,
"due
to
the
nature
of
toxics,
there
will
be
no
waivers
or
modifications,
specifically
no
variances
under
301(c)
or
301(g).
"
epa
hinges
on
that
word
"specifically",
and
said
that
is
a
word
of
limitation.
in
context,
it
is
more
appropriately
viewed
as
an
example
of
the
types
of
variances
that
congress
was
prohibiting.
epa's
argument
is
not
based
on
support
in
the
legislative
history,
it
is
based
on
silence.
that
argument
is
hardly
sufficient
to
overcome
a
statutory
provision
which
tells
you
not
to
modify
bat
on
pre-treatment
standards.
it
ignores
much
that
cuts
the
other
way.
when
congress
created
bat
in
1972,
it
said,
except
as
provided
in
301(c),
these
standards
will
be
uniform
across
the
class.
when
it
reexamined
bat
in
1977,
it
considered
the
fact
that
these
standards
might
be
viewed
by
the
courts
as
not
sufficiently
flexible,
and
they
created
301(g)
for
that
purpose,
but
it
said,
that
is
not
available
for
toxics.
when
it
examined
pre-treatment,
it
considered
the
problem
of
people
who
could
not
meet
the
standards
and
said,
the
answer
to
that
is
to
let
the
municipality
do
the
controls.
it
carefully
circumscribed
each
opportunity
to
create
a
variance.
it
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
gone
to
that
detail
if,
as
epa
maintains,
it
intended
to
leave
open
the
question
of
what
variances
could
be
given,
and
what
could
not.
indeed,
this
court
has
said,
where
congress
considers
exceptions
to
a
statute,
non-statutory
exceptions
are
not
available.
this
case
is
not
simply
an
extension
of
dupont,
as
if
congress
did
nothing
in
1977.
in
fact,
if
congress
read
dupont
the
way
epa
does,
so
that
dupont
authorized
variances
from
bat
and
pre-treatment,
it
is
strange
that
congress
would
not
have
said,
in
enacting
its
subsection
(1),
we
want
to
be
very
clear
here
to
draw
a
distinction
to
say
that
this
is
not
intended
to
rule
out
fdf
variances.
congress
didn't
do
that.
this
court
in
dupont
said
that
variances
were
not
available
from
new
source
standards.
pre-treatment
standard
are
like
new
source
standards.
there
is
no
variance
for
pre-treatment
standards.
301(c)
and
(g)
that
are
applicable
to
bat
standards
are
not
available
in
the
context
of
indirect
dischargers.
there
is
no
mechanism
for
tailoring
these
standard
to
individual
plants.
there
is
no
permit
mechanism.
the
deadlines
here
are
very
different.
congress
told
epa
to
set
the
pre-treatment
standards
more
quickly
than
it
told
epa
to
set
the
bat
and
bpt
limits,
and
it
gave
sources
only
three
years,
as
opposed
to
a
1977
or
1974
deadline
for
meeting
pre-treatment...
excuse
me,
for
meeting
bpt
or
bat.
that
makes
sense
when
you
consider
that
pre-treatment
is
a
program
with
several
goals.
it
is
not
simply
to
protect
water
quality,
it
is
also
a
program
to
protect
the
integrity
of
a
capital
investment
in
pollution
control
equipment,
the
pollution
control
equipment
at
the
municipal
sewage
treatment
plant.
pre-treatment
standards
are
to
prevent
industries
from
discharging
toxics
that
could
interfere
with
the
operation
of
that
sewage
treatment
plant,
or
that
could
contaminate
large
volumes
of
municipal
sludge.
ms.
frances

this
is
not
a
case
of
an
ambiguous
statutory
provision.
this
is
not,
for
instance,
the
chevron
case
which
this
court
decided
last
year.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
if
this
court
decides
contrary
to
our
argument
that
301(l)
is
not
clear,
then
the
question
arises,
what
could
epa
do
outside
of
the
context
of
301(l).
ms.
frances
dubrowski
that's
right.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
question.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
that's
right.
we
think
that
this
was
in
the
context
of
301
clearly
met
to
prohibit
variances.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
then
the
question
becomes,
is
that
valid?
is
this
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute?
we
think
that
it
is
not
because
the
notion
of
going
back
and
correcting
mistakes
after
you
set
a
standard
takes
place
during
a
statutory
compliance
period
of
three
years.
experience
shows
that
epa
can't
make
those
corrections
within
that
three-year
period.
in
fact
these
variance
applications
are
pending
for
seven
or
eight
years.
that
is
why
congress
said,
we
want
these
decisions
made
during
the
rulemaking,
and
make
these
standards
as
uniform
as
possible.
that
is
why
congress
said,
don't
do
a
tailor
in
a
bat
context
under
301(c),
because
it
was
concerned
about
maintaining
that
statutory
deadline.
the
fdf
variance
thwarts
that
statutory
scheme.
you
cannot
wait
seven
or
eight
years
for
a
variance
application
to
be
decided,
and
still
meet
the
three
year
statutory
deadline.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
i
just
wanted
to
add
one
other
point
to
the
answer
there,
and
that
is
that
congress
wanted
these
standards
to
be
uniform,
or
as
uniform
as
possible
across
the
class,
because
it
wanted
sources
who
paid
for
pollution
control
equipment
to
know
that
their
competitors
were
doing
likewise.
the
fdf
variance
also
thwarts
that
goal
of
uniformity
because
sources
may
delay
compliance
while
they
have
a
variance
application
pending,
even
though
that
application
may
be
prove
to
be
totally
lacking
in
merit.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
501
simply...
no.
the
direct
answer
is
no.
we
do
not
think
there
is
statutory
authority
for
variances
for
bat
and
pre-treatment,
except
as
in
301(c),
which
was
eliminated
in
1977.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
301(c)
existed
in
1972.
in
1977,
it
was
clearly
eliminated
as
far
as
toxic
pollutants.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
that
is
correct.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
that
is
correct.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
that
is
correct.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
that
is
correct.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
actually,
no,
we
don't.
it
that
sense,
it
is
very
different
from
chevron.
in
chevron,
the
agency
had
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
preceded
the
reauthorization.
here
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
prior
to
the
reauthorization,
at
least
as
far
as
practice
would
indicate,
is
directly
contrary
to
what
epa
said
it
could
do
after
the
reauthorization,
that
is,
before
1977,
epa
granted
fdf
variances
only
from
bpt,
and
the
only
variances
that
you
could
have
for
bat
were
the
301(c)
variances.
the
fdf
variance
was
not
created
in
a
bat
or
pre-treatment
context
until
after
the
law
was
amended
in
1977.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
yes.
this
is
not
a
question
of
a
change
in
administration
leading
to
a
different
interpretation
of
the
statute.
however,
there
was
a
change.
ms.
frances
dubrowski
one
other
argument
that
epa
makes
is
that
this
variance
is
necessary
to
the
rulemaking.
it
is
necessary
either
for
information
that
epa
doesn't
get
in
a
rulemaking,
or
for
information
that
it
can't
consider.
that
argument
does
not
withstand
analysis.
section
308
of
the
law
gives
epa
ample
authority
to
require,
during
the
rulemaking,
all
the
information
that
is
relevant
to
the
standard.
the
record
suggests
that
epa
should
be
making
more
use
of
308,
and
less
use
of
fdf
variance
mechanism,
because
epa
says,
we
sent
questionnaires
to
500
electroplates
and
only
200
of
whom
responded
with
some
of
the
information
that
we
requested.
if
those
sources
failed
to
bring
the
information
to
epa's
attention
during
a
rulemaking,
there
is
no
reason
to
give
them
a
second
bite
of
the
apple,
to
challenge
the
standard
after
the
rulemaking.
likewise,
epa
has
data
that
it
doesn't
consider
during
the
rulemaking.
there
is
no
reason
to
sanction
epa's
failure
to
consider
that
data.
in
fact,
its
rules
might
be
vulnerable.
thank
you.
