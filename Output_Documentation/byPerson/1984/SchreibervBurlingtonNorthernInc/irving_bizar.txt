mr.
irving
bizar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court;
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
statutory
language
enacted
by
the
congress
for
section
14(e)
in
the
williams
act
is
to
be
given
a
different
construction
in
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
used.
14(e)...
and
i
shall
paraphrase
that
briefly
for
your
honor...
provides
three
parts.
the
first
part
prohibits
misrepresentations
or
omissions
to
state
facts.
the
second
part,
preceded
by
the
disjunctive
"or",
prohibits
the
making
of
any
fraudulent,
deceptive
or
manipulative
acts
or
practices
in
connection
with
a
tender
offer.
and
the
third
part
directs
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
promulgate
regulations
to
prevent
fraudulent,
deceptive
or
manipulative
acts
or
practices.
the
courts
below
held,
although
the
third
circuit
criticized
this
finding
and
my
brothers
argue
here,
that
misrepresentation
is
required
for
any
violation
of
section
14(e),
and
they
found
none
below.
the
facts
upon
which
this
case
arises
are
relatively
simple.
they're
based
upon
a
complaint,
and
a
complaint
which
was
subject
to
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
on
which
no
evidence
was
considered,
and,
as
your
honors
know,
a
12(b)(6)
motion
assumes
the
truth
of
the
complaint.
and
those
facts
are,
briefly,
these:
burlington
northern,
after
acquiring
a
block
of
el
paso
stock,
made
a
tender
offer
for
51
percent
of
the
el
paso
stock
outstanding,
or
approximately
25-odd
million
shares,
at
$24
a
share.
they
did
this
on
december
20,
1982.
december
30,
1982,
they
have
received
the
51
percent
they
had
tendered
for.
el
paso
management,
anxious
to
defeat
this
tender
offer,
first
issued
some
preferred
stock.
burlington
northern
attacked
that
issuance
in
the
delaware
chancery
court,
and
was
on
the
very
eve
of
receiving
a
victory
in
that
court,
the
chancellor
having
announced
that
that
issue
would
be
held
illegal
and
was
calling
the
parties
in
to
consider
what
further
remedies
were
to
be
considered.
i
might
add
that
the
tender
offer
which
had
originally
been
promulgated
by
burlington
northern
had
a
number
of
outs.
the
complaint
alleges
that
those
outs
were
inapplicable.
thereafter,
on...
faced
with
defeat,
the
el
paso
management
met
with
burlington
northern
and
arranged
a
new
deal.
the
new
deal
called
for
cancellation
of
the
old
offer,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
old
offer
had
been
fully
subscribed
for,
and
provided
for,
instead,
the
following.
el
paso
would
sell
4.1
million
shares
to
burlington
northern
for
the
same
$24
per
share,
so
that
burlington
northern
would
in
effect
not
be
damaged
by
having
cancelled
its
winning
control
of
el
paso,
and
would
give
to
burlington
northern
an
option
to
acquire
another
4.9
million
shares
at
the
same
price.
burlington
northern
would
ratify
various
golden
parachute
contracts
which
had
been
entered
into
for
the
el
paso
management
and
insiders
and
then
burlington
northern
would
then
immediately
tender
for
21
million
shares,
in
which
all
of
the
shareholders
of
el
paso
would
now
be
free
to
tender,
including
the
insiders.
simply
arithmetic
would
indicate
that
having
taken
advantage
of
the
first
deal
and
having
that
destroyed,
any
30
million
shares
in
an
effort
to
offset
the
burlington
northern
position.
needless
to
say,
the
second
offer
was
over-subscribed
and
this
suit
follows.
now,
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
what
occurred
here
plainly
violated
section
14(e),
and
we
ask
your
honors
to
follow
the
reasoning
of
the
mobil
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
rather
than
the
cases
in
the
second,
third
and
fourth
circuits,
which
hold
that
misrepresentation
is
a
necessary
element
in--
mr.
irving
bizar
--we
think
those
are
the
only
circuits.
there
are
a
number
of
district
court
cases
throughout
the
country
seemingly
following
the
same
rationale.
mr.
irving
bizar
as
the
third
circuit
and
the
second
circuit.
mr.
irving
bizar
yes.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
has
suggested
in
dictum
in
a
case
we
cited
in
our
petition
and
in
our
main
brief
here
as
well
that
indicates
that
misrepresentation
need
not
be
an
element
of
a
14(e)
violation.
mr.
irving
bizar
now
i
start
my
argument
with
the
construction
of
the
statute
itself,
the
fact
that
there
are
three
provisions,
three
subdivisions,
each
of
which
are
preceded
by
the
disjunctive
"or".
my
brothers,
in
their
argument,
in
suggesting
the
affirmants
below,
suggest
and
argue
that
misrepresentation
is
a
necessary
element.
but
they
don't
offer
any
reason
why
the
congress,
if
it
wished
to
prohibit
misrepresentation
alone
in
14(e),
had
to
do
it
in
three
separate
subdivisions,
each
preceded
by
"or",
and
in
doing
it
in
the
latter
two
subdivisions,
why
they
would
have
to
use
codewords
rather
than
simply
saying
"you
shall
not
misrepresent".
they
also
argue
that
please
ignore
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
look
to
the
general
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
intent
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
statute,
and
we
say
that
argument
has
two
deficiencies.
in
the
first
place,
it
ignores
the
repeated
holdings
of
this
court
that
you
start
a
construction
of
the
statute
with
the
language
itself,
and
that
the
language
is
to
be
given
its
plain
meaning
as
plainly
understood
by
the
ordinary
person
who
reads
that
language.
and
it
also
ignores
this
court's
holding
in
the
u.s.
against
naftalin
case,
where
justice
marshall,
speaking
for
the
court,
said
that
the
use
of
the
word
"or"
at
the
end
of
a
subsection
or
at
the
beginning
of
a
subsection
prescribes
a
distinct,
separate
category
of
misconduct.
the
second
problem
with
or
second
defect
in
my
brother's
argument
is
that
there
is
no
clear,
consistent
congressional
statement
that
would
suggest
that
14(e)
is
limited
solely
to
misrepresentation.
yes,
there
are
statements
by
the
sponsors
and
others
in
congress
addressing
the
question
of
full
disclosure,
but
there
are
an
equal
number
of
statements
by
members
of
congress
and
the
sponsor
concerned
about
the
need
to
protect
shareholders
of
the
tendering...
the
target
company
with
the
need
to
have
them
act
without
pressure,
without
the
unwarranted
techniques
which
are
frequently
accompanied
in
tender
offer
fights.
mr.
irving
bizar
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
bizar
no,
i
think
not,
your
honor,
although
it
is
somewhat
unclear.
the
reason
for
that,
i
believe,
is
that
if
the
congress
intended
that
"misrepresentation"
be
part
of
"fraudulent"
or
"deceptive"
i
think
they
would
have
stopped
with
the
first
subdivision,
which
prohibits
expressly
and
clearly
what
they
desired
with
respect
to
misrepresentation.
i
think
what
congress
meant
when
they
used
"fraudulent"
and
"deceptive",
they
were
talking
about
the
very
subtle
areas
that
frequently
arise
in
tender
offer
fights
in
which
they
could
not
foresee
the
kinds
of
conduct
that
might
be
wrongful,
in
which
the
pressures
would
be
placed
upon
shareholders.
for
example,
they
could
have
had
in
mind
this
court's
definition
of
fraudulent
conduct,
said
a
long
time
ago
in
moore
against
crawford,
that
it
is
a
breach
of
any
legal
or
equitable
duty
which
injures
a
party--
mr.
irving
bizar
--i
do
not
believe
there
is
an
overlap.
mr.
irving
bizar
i
think
they
mean
two
distinct
different
categories.
i
could
not
define
for
you
those
distinct
different
categories
because
i
don't
believe
congress
meant
to
have
those
defined
as
such.
i
think
what
congress
meant
to
have
is
to
allow
the
courts
the
greatest
leeway
to
ensure
that
the
franchise
given
to
the
target
company
shareholders
would
not
be
tampered
with.
mr.
irving
bizar
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
bizar
let
me
address
that
case,
because
i
think
that
case
is
distinguishable.
in
the
first
place,
that
case
arose
in
the
10(b)
context.
secondly,
it
arose
in
the
context
where
an
attack
was
made
upon
the
substantive
fairness
of
the
proposed
acquisition.
let
me
come
back
to
the
first
part,
if
i
may,
justice
rehnquist.
we
say
that
definitions
given
for
10(b)
considerations
are
not
necessarily
the
same
definitions
to
be
given
in
14(e).
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
same
terms
used
in
the
securities
act
in
different
sections
do
not
necessarily
have
identical
meanings,
but
they
can
have
different
meanings.
for
example,
for
16(b)
purposes,
a
merger
is
not
a
sale,
whereas
for
10(b)
purposes
a
merger
is
a
sale.
now
why
should
it
be
that
there
should
be
a
different
consideration
for
10(b)
than
14(e)?
we
say
that
for
10(b)
the
congress
and
the
courts
are
concerned
with
the
integrity
of
a
purchase
and
a
sale.
they
want
to
ensure
that
the
trading
market
is
above-board
in
all
respects.
14(e)
does
not
concern
itself
with
trading
markets.
what
14(e)
is
concerned
with,
and
this
is
frequently
lost
sight
of,
is
the
right
of
the
target
company
shareholder
to
be
able
to
make
his
choice
as
to
whether
or
not
to
elect
to
accept
the
tender
offer
or
not
to
elect
to
accept
a
tender
offer,
or
to
be
free
to
sell
it
someplace
else.
and
that
choice
is
not
to
be
tampered
with.
indeed,
the
congressional
statements
are
replete
with
the
idea
that
there
is
a
delicate
balance
that
cannot
be
tipped.
this
court
recognized
as
much
in
the
piper
aircraft
case,
when
it
said
that
14(e)
was
directed
to
a
whole
range
of
conduct
by
a
whole
range
of
persons
who
were
seeking
to
influence
either
the
price
of
or
the
outcome
of
a
tender
offer.
now
perhaps
the
best
example
of
congressional
intent
is
what
congress
directed
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
do
with
respect
to
issuing
regulations
under
14(e).
it
may
recall
to
the
court
that
14(d)
also
prescribes
the
necessity
for
a
tender
offer
to
contain
full
information,
and
the
commission
has
issued
tons
of
regulations
under
14(d)
requiring
full
disclosure.
but
in
14(e)...
and
i
only
quote
two
of
those
regulations...
it
requires,
first,
that
the
tender
offer
be
kept
open
for
20
business
days,
and
in
subdivision
(c)
provides
that
when
the
tender
offer
is
completed
consideration
has
to
be
paid
promptly
or,
if
it's
terminated,
the
tendered
securities
have
to
be
returned
promptly.
and
neither
of
those
subdivisions
have
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
necessity
for
full
disclosure
or
the
like.
mr.
irving
bizar
let
me
start
by
saying
that
none
of
the
lower
courts
considered
the
question
of
whether
our
complaint
stated
a
claim
for
manipulation.
they
all
assumed
that
misrepresentation
was
the
necessary
element.
we
say
the
manipulation
occurred
as
follows:
when
they
cancelled
the
51
percent
subscribed
tender
offer,
not
because
of
any
event
which
had
occurred
outside
but
solely
by
virtue
of
the
intervention
of
the
el
paso
management
to
induce
burlington
northern
to
make
a
better
deal
for
the
el
paso
management
and
caused
a
new
offer
to
be
made
under
more
restrictive
terms
in
the
sense
of
less
shares,
while
tying
up
the
stock,
the
balance
of
the
stock
needed
to
obtain
control
so
that
no
one
else,
no
other
white
knight
would
come
in
and
offer
a
competitive
bid,
that
manipulated
the
situation
vis-a-vis
the
el
paso
stock.
and,
more
importantly,
we
say
what
it
did
do
was
take
away
the
results
and
fruits
of
the
prior
tender
offer.
we
say
14(e)
has
to
cover
a
situation
in
which
a
tender
offer
is
made
pursuant
to
the
regulations,
pursuant
to
the
statute,
full
information
having
been
given,
the
shareholders
of
the
target
company
make
their
choice
and
tender,
and
so
that
the
offer
is
fully
subscribed
for.
to
have
respondents
then
take
away
the
fruits
of
that
choice
tampers
with
the
free
choice
that
was
given
to
the
shareholders
under
14(e).
that
is
the
two
elements
we
say--
mr.
irving
bizar
--our
situation
does
not
involve,
necessarily,
a
breach
of
contract,
and
i
think
that's
my
brother's
attempt
to
characterize
the
complaint,
but
it
is
not
a
breach
of
contract.
it
may
be
a
breach
of
contract.
some
breach
of
contracts
may
have
elements
of
manipulation.
i
cannot
state
to
your
honor
all
those
times
when
breach
of
contracts
will
have
manipulation
and
those
times
when
they
will
not.
for
example,
supposing
burlington
northern
had
the
51
percent
stock
and
then
told
the
people
it
wasn't
going
to
pay.
that
might
be
a
breach
of
contract
that
may
not
constitute
a
manipulation.
but
that
didn't
happen
here.
what
happened
here
is
the
conspiring
between
the
el
paso
people
and
the
burlington
northern
to
take
away
the
fruits
of
the
first
subscribed
tender
offer
and
then
to
resubmit
a
new
tender
offer
on
less
favorable
terms,
but
more
favorable
to
the
insiders
and
ensuring
that
burlington
northern
would
not
be
damaged
in
any
respect
by
virtue
of
the
sale
of
stock
and
the
option
given
to
it.
mr.
irving
bizar
yeah,
i
think
so.
i
think
i
would
argue
that,
certainly.
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
that.
i
certainly
don't
want
to
argue
the
broader
proposition.
certainly
on
the
narrow
facts
presented
here,
that's
clear
that
there
was
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
but
that
doesn't
end
the
inquiry.
that
just
starts
the
inquiry
because
if
the
impact
is
to
prevent
the
free
auction
market,
to
prevent
the
free
choice,
or
take
away
the
free
choice
that
was
given,
then
you've
got
a
14(e)
violation.
that
was
congress'
intent,
and
that
was
why
it
provided
what
it
did.
let
me
come
back
to
the
question
of
manipulation
for
a
moment.
we
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
submit
the
facts
or
to
obtain
the
evidence
and
demonstrate
to
the
courts
below
that
a
manipulation
had
occurred,
that
the
outs
really
didn't
apply,
that
the
respondents
estopped
to
assert
any
outs,
and
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
market
was
artificially
impacted
and
prevented
from
freely
functioning.
that
showing
was
permitted
in
mobil
because
it
arose
under
different
procedural
circumstances.
now
my
brothers
ignore
the
rule
that
a
12(b)(6)
motion
kind
of
addresses
only
the
complaint
and
attempt
to
assert
a
whole
slew
of
other
facts,
principally
addressed
to
the
fact
that
respondents
acted
in
good
faith
and
a
slew
of
related
circumstances.
i
must
say
not
only
were
we
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
contest
that,
but
in
fact
that
is
contested.
we
say...
no
matter
what
they
say,
we
say
the
outs
do
not
apply
and
did
not
apply.
and
we
say
further
that
whatever
facts
they
have
asserted,
these
outside
facts,
they
are
the
subject
of
great
dispute.
for
example,
respondents
argue
that
the
second
stage
of
the
burlington
northern
offer...
as
your
honors
know,
in
a
tender
offer,
frequently
after
control
occurs
later
on
they
make
a
tender
for
the
balance
of
the
shares
in
order
to
merge
the
companies
in,
and
that's
what
occurred
here
with
respect
to
the
second
tender
offer.
that
under
the
second
stage,
the
target
shareholders
received,
those
who
hadn't
tendered
at
the
first
stage,
got
$24
in
consideration.
we
contest
that.
what
they
got
was
$12
in
cash
and
some
paper
which
we
say,
had
we
been
given
the
opportunity,
we
would
have
demonstrated
that
that
was
not
worth
the
$24
cash
offered
in
the
original
51
percent
subscribed
tender
offer.
now
i
think
i
have
recited
to
your
honors
the
factual
pattern.
my
brothers
try
to
argue
that
their...
that
those
kinds
of
things
are
really
breach
of
contract,
breach
of
fiduciary
obligations,
and
suggest
to
you
that
those
are
best
left
to
the
state
court.
we
say
that
that
is
clearly
not
that
they
have
attempted
to
isolate
the
transaction
into
different
parts,
but
that
the
transaction
is
a
continuous
one
and
running
it
continuously
through
there
was
an
attempt
taken
to
interfere
with
the
franchise
given
to
the
target
company
shareholders
to
make
their
election
and,
as
a
result,
damage
occurred.
now
i
might
remind
the
court
of
what
the
second
circuit
said
a
long
time
in
the
crane
company
case,
that
manipulative
schemes
should
not
be
allowed
to
succeed
solely
because
they
are
novel.
now
my
brothers
argue
that
the
state
courts
provide
a
remedy.
i'd
like
to
address
that
for
a
few
moments
because
i
think
that
really
poses
a
false
issue.
the
fact
is
the
state
courts
and
state
remedies
are
totally
inadequate.
let
me
demonstrate
why.
you
have
a
national
offer
which
spreads
over
50
states
pursuant
to
federal
statutes.
the
injured
shareholders
will
now
have
to
sue
in
any
one
of
those
50
states.
state
one
may
claim
the
conduct
was
legal;
state
two
may
say
the
conduct
was
impermissible.
each
of
the
tender
offer
states
will
find
litigations
ensuing
at
different
stages;
the
net
result
will
be
that
the
tender
offer
will
be
clogged
with
endless
litigation,
with
no
real
resolution
as
to
whether
an
injury
has
occurred
or
not.
there
being
no
uniform
standards
of
what
fiduciary
conduct
or
breach
of
contract
are
vis-a-vis
all
50
states,
state
a
may
rightly
say
there
was
no
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
state
b
may
say
there
was.
mr.
irving
bizar
let
me
address
that.
there
is
no
uniform
class
action
statutes
in...
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
irving
bizar
which
state
would
have
the
class
action?
which
state
would
have
the
uniform
class
statute,
class
act
statute,
which
would
encompass
all
of
the
injured--
mr.
irving
bizar
--no.
mr.
irving
bizar
no.
let
me
go
on.
a
number
of
states
have
opt-ins;
a
number
of
states
have
opt-outs.
some
states
provide
no
notice
to
the
class;
some
states
provide
notice
to
the
class
in
terms
of
whether
plaintiff
is
an
adequate
representative.
what
assurance
is
there
that
that
particular
state
you
may
get
jurisdiction
over
all
the
defendants
who
may
have
only
committed
one
act--
mr.
irving
bizar
--no.
i
would
say,
justice
stevens,
that
they
are
basically
brought
in
the
federal
courts
for
federal
statutes,
for
federal
jurisdiction
and
a
uniform
federal
class
action
rule
which
governs,
so
that
it
becomes
easy
to
fit
where
the
parts
belong
and
who
the
parties
are.
that
is
not
true
in
the
states.
nor
is
it
clear
that
any
particular
state
constitutionally
could
assert
a
nationwide
class
action
when
the
only
basis
for
jurisdiction
might
be
a
few
of
its
citizens
live
in
its
own
state,
and
that,
i
understand,
is
before
this
court
in
another
matter.
so
we
say
that
you
have
given
the
stockholders
of
the
target
company
a
remedy,
a
right,
but
you
haven't
given
them
an
adequate
remedy
if
you
leave
it
to
the
states
to
continue
to
litigate
this
question
in
successive
stages.
mr.
irving
bizar
i
would
have
to
prove
that,
i
would
guess,
perhaps.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
have
to
prove
it
artificially
affected
the
market
price.
i
think
i
would
have
to
prove
that
it
artificially
locked
the
market
in
such
a
manner
that
there
couldn't
be
free
auction
for
shares,
and
we
were
deprived
of
that
opportunity
to
prove
that
because
the
12(b)(6)
motion
takes
the
complaint
on
its
face
and
there
is
no
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
irving
bizar
no.
i
think
what
buffalo
forge
was
adopting
was
that--
mr.
irving
bizar
--i
must
prove
that
the
market
was
artificially
locked
up
by
the
defendant's
conduct.
mr.
irving
bizar
it
is
not
a
question
of
misleading
investors
because
frequently
these
facts
are
disclosed
to
the
investors
well
after
the
fact
and
the
so-called
potential
white
knights
or
whatever
say
well,
we
can't
go
into
this
situation
because
we
have
to
bid
for
30
million,
40
million,
we
have
to
raise
$200
million
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time.
we're
not
going
to
be
in
a
position
to
do
all
that
so
quickly.
it's
not
a
question
of
disclosure.
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
have
a
free
market
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
irving
bizar
i
make
no
contention
with
respect
to
the
price
itself.
unlike
santa
fe,
which
came
out
of
the
context
of
an
unfair
price,
the
williams
act
does
not
address
the
question
of
an
unfair
price.
what
the
williams
act
addresses
is
the
right
of
the
target
company
shareholder
to
sell
his
shares
or
to
tender
his
shares
once
given
full
information,
but
to
ensure
that
all
of
the
information
and
all
of
the
market
factors
are
neutral
so
that
he
can
make
it
without
having
the
balance
tipped.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal.
mr.
irving
bizar
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
attempt
to
address
some
of
the
arguments
made
by
my
brother
cherno.
first,
he
has
gone
through
a
long
recitation
of
facts.
let
me
state
that
none
of
those
facts
were
submitted
below
and
i
think
unfair
for
him
to
argue
it
here
when
we
have
been
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
contest
those
facts.
let
me
address
the
question
of
the
outs
which
he
says
took
place.
the
complaint
specifically
alleges
that
the
outs
were
inapplicable.
indeed,
the
delaware
court
very
expressly
said
that
the
estoppel
argument,
to
wit
that
respondents
could
not
assert
those
outs,
were
abandoned
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
irving
bizar
it
is
a
combination
of
both,
because
i
suppose,
justice
stevens--
mr.
irving
bizar
--that's
correct.
i
think
the
problem
was--
mr.
irving
bizar
--that's
right.
it's
the
combination
of
both.
they
made
the
first
offer.
it
was
over-subscribed.
when
these
various
events
occurred
that
my
brother
cherno
was...
adverts
to,
they
didn't
stop
the
offer.
they
went
forward
with
the
offer.
they
contested
the
litigations
and
they
only
withdrew
those,
the
first
offer,
as
a
result
of
the
direct
agreement
they
made
with
the
el
paso
management
which
favored
the
el
paso
management.
that,
we
say,
is
manipulation.
now
let
me
just--
mr.
irving
bizar
--that
is
correct.
now
let
me
address
the
delaware
action
which
my
brother,
cherno,
made
reference.
in
the
first
place,
barbara
schreiber
is
not
a
party
to
that
action.
in
that
action,
which
was
started
second
to
our
case,
they
stipulated
to
class
action
status
ex
parte,
without
notice
to
any
representative,
without
notice
to
the
class.
to
assert
that
whether
or
not
that
plaintiff
or
those
plaintiffs
are
adequate
representatives,
i
don't
think
that
any
result
reached
in
that
court
would
be
binding
anyplace
either
constitutionally
or
under
any
fair
sense
of
fair
play.
finally,
it
may
be
possible
that
the
conduct
of
respondents
violates
state
law,
but
it
is
equally
true
that
it
also
violates
federal
law.
and
contrary
to
what
my
brother,
cherno,
argues,
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
in
this
unique
sense
of
a
cash
tender
offer
congress
was
directly
concerned
with
that.
you
are
not
required
to
fashion
a
whole
new
body
of
law;
you
are
simply
being
required
to
enforce
the
statute
which
the
congress
directed;
to
wit,
to
ensure
that
the
franchise
given
to
the
target
company
shareholders
not
be
tampered
with
as
it
was
tampered
here.
that's
simple
enough.
we
ask
that
the
decisions
be
reversed.
