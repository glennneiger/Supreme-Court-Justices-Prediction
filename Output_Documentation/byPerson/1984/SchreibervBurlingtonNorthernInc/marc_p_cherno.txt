mr.
marc
p.
cherno
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case,
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
williams
act,
meant
for
the
courts
to
fashion,
without
any
congressional
guidelines
or
any
standards,
a
federal
common
law
of
contract
or
of
corporate
governance.
the
answer
is,
as
we
see
it,
by
any
standard
in
which
statutes
are
interpreted,
that
congress
intended
no
such
result.
any
such
result,
any
such
cause
of
action,
such
as
plaintiff
claims
here,
would
be
inconsistent
first
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
plain
language
of
the
williams
act,
which
talks
in
terms
of
fraud,
of
deception,
of
manipulation,
and
not
in
terms
of
contract.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
williams
act,
which
demonstrates
over
and
again
that
the
williams
act
was
intended
as
a
disclosure
statute,
intended
to
provide
and
extend
the
disclosure
regulations
which
existed
for
other
change
in
control
transactions,
such
as
proxy
contests
and
exchange
offers,
to
what
it
viewed
as
the
new
phenomenon
of
a
cash
tender
offer,
which
it
viewed
as
functionally
equivalent
to
those
other
change
in
control
transactions.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
section
14(e)
itself,
which
clearly
was
intended
to
police
and
regulate
the
new
disclosure
obligations
created
by
the
remainder
of
the
williams
act.
and
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
teachings
and
dispositive
opinions
of
this
court,
particularly
the
decisions
in
the
piper-chris-craft
case
and
the
santa
fe-green
case.
and
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
fundamental
principles
of
federalism
which
infuse
and
underly
the
relationships
between
the
federal
securities
laws,
on
the
one
hand,
and
state
law
on
the
other
hand.
and
those
principles
basically
are
that
the
federal
securities
laws
regulate
the
disclosure
that's
to
be
made
to
people
who
are
asked
to
engage
in
securities
transactions,
and
they
regulate,
in
some
instances,
procedures
designed
to
make
sure
that
that
disclosure
is
effective,
and
that
the
state
law,
on
the
other
hand,
which
was
never
intended
to
be
supplanted
by
the
federal
securities
laws,
regulate
matters
of
contract,
matters
of
corporate
governance,
matters
of
fiduciary
obligations.
so
creating
this
new
and
totally
uncharted
and
uncontoured
cause
of
action
that
petitioner
would
have
the
court
create
would
be
inconsistent,
i
submit,
with
all
of
those
basic
principles.
indeed,
it
would
be
to
do
what
justice
brennan
warned
against
in
the
bergsen-lasker
case,
and
that
is
to
have
the
federal...
where
he
said
that
the
federal
courts
were
not
to
fashion
an
entire
body
of
federal
corporate
law
out
of
whole
cloth.
they
would
have
to
do
that
if
the
cause
of
action
which
petitioner
seeks
to
create
actually
came
into
existence.
now
before
i
go
to
the
facts
which
underlie
this
case,
i'd
like
to
mention
a
few
things
on
mr.
bizar's
argument.
in
the
first
instance,
mr.
bizar
said
he's
not
suing
for
breach
of
contract.
if
i
read
his
complaint
correctly,
that's
all
he's
suing
for.
when
he
talks
in
his
complaint
about
what
violates
the
williams
act,
what
violates
section
14(e)
in
paragraph
25,
what
he
says
was
that
the
conduct
violated
the
williams
act
in
the
following
respects.
(a)
the
improper
termination
and
withdrawal
of
a
tender
offer
constituted
a
willful
breach
of
the
tender
offer
agreements.
now
that's
precisely
a
breach
of
contract
claim
and
that
is
precisely
what's
going
on
in
the
state
court
with
respect
to
this
very
transaction.
there
is
a
litigation
pending
in
the
state
courts.
it's
a
litigation
called
the
gilbert
case.
it
was
started
by
a
group
of
shareholders
similarly
situated
to
mr.
bizar.
it
was
certified
as
a
class
action
and
indeed
it
includes
mr.
bizar's
client
among
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case.
in
that
delaware
state
court
action,
there
is
being
litigated
at
this
moment
whether
burlington
in
fact
breached
its
contractual
obligations
to
el
paso
shareholders,
whether
in
fact
el
paso
directors
violated
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
their
fiduciary
obligations
to
their
shareholders.
those
are
the
precise
litigation
that
is
going
on
in
the
delaware
state
court,
and
that's
the
court
where
it
should
be
going
on.
now
to
create
the
cause
of
action
that
petitioner
seeks
to
create
would
not
only
be
contrary
to
every
principle
of
statutory
interpretation
but
it
would
be
entirely
unnecessary.
it
would
simply
and
merely
duplicate
the
existing
causes
of
action
under
state
law,
which,
as
i
said,
are
proceeding
right
here.
and,
in
fact,
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
state
court
has
already
held
that
the
outs
which
mr.
bizar
has
claimed
do
not
exist
in
fact
exist.
it
has
already
held
on
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
burlington
northern
had
an
absolute
right
under
the
contract
conditions
contained
in
the
tender
offer
to
terminate
its
contract.
to
create
this
cause
of
action
would
be
to
allow
federal
courts,
without
any
standards,
any
contours,
or
any
guidelines,
to
fashion
federal
common
law
without
any
notice
to
any
of
the
parties
who
may
be
involved
in
tender
offers
as
to
what
conduct
might
be
prohibited
and
what
conduct
might
be
permitted.
any
such
cause
of
action
could
only,
in
the
long
run,
unnecessarily
burden,
inhibit
and
deter
tender
offers,
and
defeat
the
very
tender
offers
which
congress
wishes
to
regulate
and
to
preserve
when
it
enacted
the
williams
act.
and
an
example
of
this
is
shown
by
what's
happened
after
the
sixth
circuit's
mobil
decision.
and
to
respond,
let
me
interject
that
it's
the
second
circuit,
the
third
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
the
eighth
circuit,
and
the
seventh
circuit
which
have
all
held...
they
have
all
rejected
mobil
and
all
held
that
the
misleading
of
investors
is
required
under
14(e)
for
a
cause
of
action
to
be
stated.
but
to
come
back,
in
the
aftermath
of
the
sixth
circuit's
mobil
decision
every
single
thing
that's
happened
in
a
tender
offer
has
been
called
a
manipulative
device
by
a
plaintiff's
attorney
and
everything
has
been
hauled
into
a
federal
court.
now
all
of
those
federal
courts
have
rejected
those
claims,
but
the
burdens,
the
expense,
the
unnecessary
inhibition
of
tender
offers
is
precisely
what's
happened
and
precisely
what
would
happen
if
this
type
of
cause
of
action
were
sanctions.
the
facts
of
this
case
i
should
turn
to,
because
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
facts
are
absolutely
dispositive
for
if
the
conduct
at
issue
in
this
case
could
be
called
fraud,
there
is
no
conduct
which
couldn't
be
called
fraud
in
some
allegation
under
the
federal
securities
laws,
and
you
would
have
an
automatic
federal
cause
of
action
for
any
conduct
that
takes
place
in
a
tender
offer.
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
fraud
would
require
the
misleading
of
investors.
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
that's
the
kind
of
fraud
which
has
traditionally
been
required
to
state
a
claim
under
the
federal
securities
laws.
that's
precisely
what
your
opinion
in
santa
fe
says,
as
i
read
it,
and
it's
precisely--
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
--the
court's
opinion,
i
am
sorry,
that
you
authored
and
santa
fe
stated,
and
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
every
other
decision
of
this
court
which
deals
with
the
federal
securities
laws.
there
is
nothing
in
any
decision
of
this
court
which
states
other
than
that
the
misleading
of
investors
is
required
to
state
a
claim
for
fraud
under
the
federal
securities
laws
and
under
their
anti-fraud
provisions.
now
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think,
are,
as
i
said,
dispositive.
what
was
the
bottom
line
of
what
burlington
northern
did?
what
it
did
was
make
a
premium
acquisition
of
el
paso
corporation
at
a
price
which
provided
premium
prices
to
all
el
paso
shareholders.
at
every
step
along
the
way
it
told
el
paso
shareholders
what
did
happen
and
what
could
have
happened.
it
made
a
tender
offer
for
50
percent
of
el
paso's
stock.
the
tender
offer
was
at
a
premium
price.
the
offer
included
conditions.
all
tender
offers
include
conditions.
there
is
no
claim
that
those
conditions
were
not
unequivocally
stated,
in
the
plaintiff's
language,
to
shareholders.
and
what
those
conditions
are
for,
as
they
always
are,
is
to
protect
an
offeror
and
its
own
shareholders,
who
have
committed
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
an
acquisition
effort
from
circumstances
which
could
defeat
or
frustrate
the
purpose
of
an
offer.
the
shareholders
were
fully
informed
of
these
conditions
and
they
were
fully
informed
of
the
fact
that
if
any
of
these
events
took
place
that
could
lead
to
the
termination
of
the
offer.
and
there's
been
no
claim
by
mr.
bizar
that
they
were
not
so
fully
informed
or
that
there
was
anything
confusing
or
misleading
in
any
way
about
these
conditions.
they
were
unequivocally
stated.
and
let
me
say
that
these
conditions
were
not
arcane
or
abstruse
or
irrational
or
arbitrary,
although
they
could
have
been.
an
offeror
has,
i
submit,
the
same
freedom
of
contract
as
any
other
party
that
conducts
business.
these
conditions
were
essential,
basic
conditions
that
went
to
the
heart
of
the
acquisition
process
and
the
acquisition
effort.
what
were
they?
they
were,
first,
if
anyone
instituted
litigation
seeking
to
enjoin
the
offer,
that
was
a
basis
on
which
the
offer
could
be
terminated.
again,
an
offeror
hardly
has
to
run
the
risk
of
being
tied
up
in
endless
litigation
if
it
chooses
to
avoid
that
risk.
if
any
governmental
body
attempted
to
come
in
and
enjoin
the
tender
offer,
again
that
was
a
condition
which
permitted
burlington
northern
to
withdraw
that
offer.
if
the
target
company
issued
any
stock,
any
new
class
of
stock,
which
would
dilute
the
voting
rights
that
the
offeror
hoped
to
acquire
by
the
offer,
again
that
was
an
event
which
permitted
the
offer
to
be
withdrawn.
if
the
target
company
threatened
to
sell
its
assets,
again
an
event
which
permitted
the
tender
offer
to
be
withdrawn.
and
again
that
just
makes
obvious
good
sense.
one
wouldn't
want
to
go
through
with
a
tender
offer
and
find
that
the
assets
that
it
made
the
tender
offer
for
in
the
first
place
were
gone.
there's
no
principle
of
securities
law
or
contract
law
which
says
that
you
have
to
wait
till
the
horse
is
gone
to
close
the
barn
door.
and
that
again
was
a
clear
provision
in
the
tender
offer
contract.
and
a
particularly
important
provision
and
one
that
shareholders
were
totally
on
notice
of
is
that
the
offer
could
be
terminated
if
an
acquisition
agreement
was
reached
between
the
offeror
and
the
target
company.
that's
the
way
most
acquisitions
indeed
take
place.
that's
the
way
many
hostile
offers
are
ultimately
resolved
and
shareholders
were
told
in
unequivocal
terms
that
what
ultimately
happened
was
exactly
what
could
happen.
if
el
paso
and
burlington
northern
got
together
and
reached
an
agreement,
that
would
permit
burlington
northern
to
terminate
this
tender
offer.
there
is
no
question
that
they
were
precisely
on
notice
that
that's
what
could
happen.
now
in
addition
to
that
happening,
almost
all
of
the
other
events
that
could
give
rise
to
the
right
to
terminate
this
tender
offer
in
fact
took
place.
there
was
extensive
litigation
instituted
by
el
paso
against
this
tender
offer.
on
the
eve
of
the...
on
the
morning
that
the
agreement
between
burlington
and
el
paso
was
reached,
that
litigation
was
about
to
go
to
trial
in
el
paso,
texas.
the
state
of
texas
came
in
and
instituted
a
state
antitrust
action
seeking
to
enjoin
this
offer,
and
again
on
that
same
morning
that
antitrust
action
was
going
to
go
to
trial.
el
paso
issued
preferred
stock,
the
effect
of
which
would
have
been
to
dilute
the
voting
rights
that
burlington
would
have
acquired
if
it
had
gone
ahead
with
the
tender
offer.
that
was
the
precursor
of
the
poison
pill
preferred
stock
that
people
now
talk
about
in
tender
offers,
and
it's
nice
to
know
from
mr.
bizar
that
we
would
have
gotten
that
declared
illegal,
but
it
never
happened.
the
court
had
not
yet
rendered
its
decision.
it
had
not
told
any
of
us
how
it
was
going
to
rule,
and
the
court
had
not
ruled
as
of
the
day
the
agreement
was
reached.
and
mr.
bizar's
statement
is
just
fanciful.
it's
just
made
up
out
of
whole
cloth.
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
that's
right.
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
i
think
manipulation
means,
in
this
statute,
conduct
intended
to
mislead
investors
by
artificially
affecting
market
activity.
it's
the
same
thing
that
this
court
said
it
meant
in
hochfelder.
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
certainly
not,
your
honor.
there's
no...
first,
it
didn't
happen.
in
fact,
what
happened--
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
--no.
i
think
we
only
have
to
take
the
facts,
not
conclusory
allegations
as
assumed.
in
the
first
place,
it
didn't
happen.
indeed,
what
happened
here
was
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
second
tender
offer
there
was
another
three
weeks
in
which
a
white
knight
could
have
come
in.
let
me
say
something
else--
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
--although
that
is
not
this
case--
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
--i
would
say
that
that
does
not
violate
section
14(e).
what
that
might
be,
justice
stevens,
is
your
classic
example
of
a
breach
of
fiduciary
obligations,
and
if
burlington
somehow--
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
--if
you
read
the
legislative
history,
you
see
no
concern
whatever
with
that
kind
of
problem.
and
again
let
me
say
what
a
manipulative
practice
could
be
in
a
tender
offer
i
think
is
well
indicated
by
one
of
the
cases
that
mr.
bizar
mentioned,
the
crane
and
westinghouse
case.
there's
almost
a
standard
example.
there
was
a
tender
offeror
and
there
was
a
favored
bidder
that
had
entered
into
a
merger
agreement
with
the
target
company.
on
the
last
day
before
the
hostile
tender
offeror's
tender
offer
was
about
to
expire,
what
this
other
merger
partner
did
was
go
into
the
market,
buy
a
lot
of
securities
in
unreal
transactions,
because
they
were
secret
sales
that
were
to
take
place
the
next
day.
it
drove
up
the
price
of
the
target
company
stock
beyond
the
tender
offer
price
that
the
hostile
offeror
was
offering,
and
operated
to
defeat
the
tender
offer.
the
shareholders,
seeing
what
the
price
was,
said
why
should
i
take
this
tender
offer.
so
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
classic
example
of
manipulation
and
misleading
investors
in
a
tender
offer
context.
the
creation--
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
--yes,
it's
also
fraud,
in
my
view.
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
i
think
manipulation
is
a
species
of
fraud.
i
think
fraud
is
a
broader
concept
that
includes
among
it
manipulation,
and
i
think
that
manipulation--
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
--well,
i
think
10(b)(5),
justice
white,
was
drafted
the
same
way.
it
talked
about
the
separate--
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
--well,
i
don't
think
10(b)(5)
was
sloppy,
nor
do
i
think
that
the--
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
--nor
do
i
think
the
court's
santa
fe
opinion,
which
said
that
manipulative
conduct
would
have
to
include
deceptive
conduct,
despite
the
use
of
the
word
"or"
was
a
sloppy
opinion.
nor
do
i
think
it
would
be
sloppy
for
the
court
similarly
to
hold
that
fraudulent,
deceptive
and
manipulative
all
require
the
misleading
of
investors,
as
those
terms
were
used
by
congress
and
have
been
traditionally
defined
under
the
securities
laws.
and
one
of
the
maxims
that
i
set
forth
in
my
brief
is
that
a
word
is
known
by
the
company
it
keeps,
and
when
words
are
used
together
it
is
often
because
they
have
the
same
essential
generic
meaning
and
that
they
all
carry
with
it
a
thread
of
similar
conduct.
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
i
would
hope
it
would
carry
the
day
in
section
14(e)
also.
let
me...
coming
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
all
of
these
conditions,
all
of
these
events,
came
into
place.
i
was
mentioning
the
sale
of
assets.
el
paso
went
out
and
announced
that
it
was
going
to
sell
and
negotiating
to
sell
its
major
assets,
again
a
clear
condition
which
permitted
us
to
withdraw
the
tender
offer.
so
what
did
burlington...
in
light
of
all
these
conditions,
i
submit,
it
is
clear
that
burlington
could
have
withdrawn
its
offer,
packed
its
bags
and
gone
home
entirely
and
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
el
paso.
under
those
circumstances,
el
paso
shareholders
would
have
gotten
nothing
at
all.
no
one
would
have
gotten
a
premium
price.
what
it
did
instead
was
something
that
was
far
more
beneficial
to
el
paso
shareholders,
and
that
was
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
el
paso.
let
me
say
one
other
thing.
at
the
time
that
this
agreement
was
entered
into
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
us
having
the
shares
locked
up
in
our
treasury,
that
we
had
the
right
to
purchase
them.
we
had
no
right
to
purchase
those
shares
at
that
time.
the
shareholders
had
two
more
days
in
which
to
withdraw
their
tenders.
the
world
knows
that
a
lot
of
things
happen
to
tender
offers
in
those
two
days.
if
a
white
knight
or
some
other
party
had
come
in
on
one
of
those
two
days,
we
have
no
right
to
buy
those
shares.
so
just
as
we
had
the
right
under
our
contract
to
terminate
the
tender
offer,
el
paso
shareholders
similarly
had
the
right
under
the
williams
act
to
withdraw
their
tenders.
both
sides
at
that
moment
in
time
still
had
the
rights
provided
for
them
both
by
the
williams
act
and
by
the
contractual
provisions
themselves.
so
what
we
did,
what
burlington
and
el
paso
did,
was
enter
into
an
agreement
which...
a
normal
and
typical
acquisition
agreement
which
provided
benefits
for
everyone.
the
benefit
it
provided
for
burlington,
first,
is
that
we
were
able
to
acquire
the
50
percent
interest
that
we
had
sought
to
acquire.
another
benefit
it
provided
for
burlington
was
that
we
were
freed
from
the
risks
of
the
sale
of
assets,
we
were
freed
from
the
risks
of
a
court
injunction,
el
paso
agreed
to
use
its
best
efforts
with
the
state
of
texas
to
get
it
to
terminate
the
state
antitrust
action.
we
were
not
freed,
by
the
way,
from
the
risk
of
a
white
knight.
in
fact,
since
the
mechanism
that
was
adopted
was
a
new
tender
offer
with
a
new
20
business
days,
a
white
knight...
there
was
more
opportunity
in
fact
for
a
white
knight
to
come
in
under
this
mechanism
than
there
would
have
been
if
we
had
gone
ahead
with
our
tender
offer.
but
we
were
freed
from
the
particular
risk
that
the
contract,
the
tender
offer
contract
itself,
sought
to
protect
us
against.
what
did
this
do
for
el
paso
shareholders?
first,
it
got
them
the
premium
prices
that
we
were
offering.
second,
el
paso
asked
and
we
agreed
to
put
$100
million
of
badly-needed
capital,
what
el
paso's
directors
believed
was
badly-needed
capital
into
the
corporation.
third,
and
most
important,
i
think,
from
el
paso's
shareholders'
rights
or
standpoint
is
el
paso
exacted
and
burlington
agreed
that...
to
very
important
protections
against
any
second-step
merger.
previously,
one
of
el
paso's
complaints
about
our
tender
offer
was
that
there
were
no
protections
whatever
if
we...
if,
after
we
had
acquired
the
50
percent
we
wanted
to
go
ahead
and
acquire
the
company,
the
rest
of
the
shares,
in
a
merger
transaction,
we
could
dictate
the
price;
we'd
have
majority
ownership.
what
el
paso
management
exacted
from
us
is
an
undertaking
that
would
have
no
second-step
merger
transactions
unless
it
was
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
remaining
el
paso
directors
who
are
not
associated
with
burlington,
and
unless
it
was
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
remaining
minority
public
shareholders...
non-burlington
shareholders.
that
was
the
nature
of
the
agreement
and
it's
an
agreement
that
made
a
lot
of
sense
to
everyone
concerned.
and
in
fact
what
happened
later
on
down
the
pike
was
a
merger
was
completed
and
it
was
completed
under
the
procedures
set
up
under
that
agreement.
now,
your
honors,
if
that
constitutes
fraud,
there
is
nothing
that
doesn't
constitute
fraud
under
the
federal
securities
act
and
any
claim
of
any
nature
could
be
alleged
to
be
fraud
or
manipulative
or
deceptive
and
brought
into
federal
court
and
a
wholly
new
and
uncharted
and
uncontoured
burden
could
be
placed
on
those
who
participate
in
tender
offers.
that
is
not
what
congress
intended.
coming
back
to
the
statutory
guidelines,
let's
talk
for
a
second
about
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
if
there's
one
thing
about
plain...
if
there's
one
thing
that's
plainer,
it's
that
contract
doesn't
mean
fraud
and
that
fraud
doesn't
mean
contract.
the
words
"fraudulent",
"deceptive",
and
"manipulative"
do
not
mean
contract.
it's
easy
to
regulate
contractual
relationships
if
congress
wants
to.
it
could
write
the
word
down;
it
didn't.
it
used
in
fact
words
which
are
almost
jurisprudentially
opposite.
it
used
tort
concepts,
fraud
concepts,
deception
concepts,
not
contract
concepts.
if
it
wanted
to
regulate
the
breach
of
fiduciary
obligations,
it
could
do
that
also.
it
didn't.
let's
talk
about
the
legislative
history.
the
williams
act
is
blessed
with
an
extensive
legislative
history
and
it's
blessed
with
a
very
pointed
legislative
history.
and
what
that
legislative
history
says
over
and
again
is
this
is
a
disclosure
statute.
it's
intended
to
extend
the
disclosure
protections
which
exist
on
other
types
of
change
in
control
transactions
to
cash
tender
offers.
this
is
a
new
phenomenon.
it's
not
regulated.
let's
extend
those
disclosure
protections
to
cash
tender
offers.
it
says
that
over
and
over
again
in
the
legislative
history.
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
was
concerned
with
contractual
issues.
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
conditions
that
were
put
on
contracts.
there
isn't
any
of
that.
it's
not
a
question...
i
suggest
that
before
you
displace
a
whole
body
of
state
law
you'd
have
to
have
the
most
clearest
and
unequivocal
statement
of
congressional
intent
to
do
that,
but
you
don't
even
come
close
to
that
here.
you
don't
have
a
word.
you
don't
have
an
iota.
you
don't
have
an
inkling
of
congressional
intent
to
accomplish
such
a
broad-gauged,
sweeping
purpose
as
displacing
state
law,
regulating
contract,
regulating
fiduciary
obligations.
that's
just
not
what
congress
was
about,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
remotely
suggests
it.
let's
talk
about
the
legislative
history
of
section
14(e)
itself.
there
you
have
a
much
sparser
legislative
history
and
the
reason
is,
i
submit,
because
no
one
suggested
that
section
14(e)
was
intended
to
do
anything
singularly
new
in
the
securities
laws.
it
was
intended
to
be
the
same
type
of
anti-fraud
provision
as
applied
to
tender
offers
as
already
existed
in
the
anti-fraud...
in
the
securities
laws
with
respect
to
other
transactions,
and
one
hardly
needs
a
lot
of
congressional
statements
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
the
language
of
the
statute
was
clearly
modeled
on
an
amalgam
of
rule
10(b)(5)
and
section
10(b),
and
it
was
obviously
intended
to
police
the
disclosure
obligations
which
the
rest
of
the
williams
act
was
creating.
it's
clearly
what
section
14(e)
was
about.
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
you
know,
i'm
puzzled
by
the
whole
theory
of
the
case.
i
think
it's
what...
the
difference
between
the
price
of
the
stock
under
the
original
offer
and
what
the
stock
may
have
fallen
to
at
some
point
after
the
original
offer
was
withdrawn.
it's
the
best
that
i
can
surmise
from
the
complaint,
and
that
seems
to
be
posited
on
some
theory
that
when
a
tender
offer
is
made
you
have
an
absolute
right
of
all
shareholders
to
get
that
tender
offer
price
irrespective
of
the
conditions
under
which
it's
made.
it's
like
it
writes
the
conditions
out
of
the
tender
offer.
we
made
an
offer
for
$24
and
he
has
the
right
to
it.
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
i'm
not
sure
either,
but
in
either
case
i
think
it's
posited
on
the
wholly
fallacious
theory
that
somehow
once
an
offeror
starts
a
tender
offer
he
has...
shareholders
have
the
right
to
that
price.
it's
theirs.
it's
in
their
pocket.
it
doesn't
matter
that
conditions
exist.
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
conditions
say
you
can
terminate
it
and
walk
away
entirely.
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
offer
says
you
can
make
a
deal
with
the
target
company
management.
you
somehow
have
the
right
to,
in
this
case,
$24.
mr.
marc
p.
cherno
i
think
that
the
law
can
contemplate
that,
justice
stevens,
and
that's
what's
in
front
of
the
delaware
chancery
court.
if
we
breached
our
contract,
if
we
did
something
under
that
tender
offer
contract
that
we
shouldn't
have
done,
the
delaware
chancery
court
will
so
hold.
that's
the
litigation
it's
conducting
and
that's
exactly
what
that
litigation
is
about.
and
the
law
may
possibly
contemplate
that.
we
argue
there
that
it
doesn't.
we
argue
that
if
we
have
the
right
under
express
conditions
to
withdraw
the
contract
and
to
withdraw
the
offer
and
those
conditions
take
place,
we've
complied
with
all
we
have
to
comply
with.
i
thank
you.
