justice
white
are
those
the
only
circuits?
justice
white
as
the
third
circuit?
justice
white
so
the
sixth
circuit
is
the
only...
the
sixth
circuit
is
the
only
one
supporting
your
position?
justice
white
i
see--
justice
white
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
you
need
not
even
prove
in
a
case
like
this
that
the
action
complained
of
artificially
affected
the
market
price.
justice
white
i
take
it
the
second
circuit
in
buffalo
forge
has
said
that
manipulative
acts
reached
only
transactions
that
might
mislead
investors
in
the
making
of
investment
decisions.
do
you
think
you
have
to
prove
something
like
that?
justice
white
i
know.
but
what
must
you
prove?
justice
white
well,
would
that
mislead
investors?
justice
white
when
you
said
"fraud"
there,
that
would
include
misleading
investors?
justice
white
and
that
would
be
an
example
of
the
kind
of
fraud
you
are
talking
about?
justice
white
you
mean
the
court's
opinion.
justice
white
but
it's
also
fraud,
in
your
view?
justice
white
so
you
don't
think
manipulation
means
something
different
from
fraud?
justice
white
so
this
was
just
a
piece
of
bad
draftsmanship
in
writing
the
williams
act
in
saying
"or"?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be.
that
may
be,
but
one
wrong...
one
sloppy
job
doesn't
justify
another.
justice
white
well,
it
took
a
lot
of
cases
to
prove
that
it
wasn't,
didn't
it?
justice
white
well,
that
argument
certainly
carried
the
day
in
10(b)(5),
didn't
it?
