justice
stevens
--mr.
bizar,
at
an
appropriate
time
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
if
we
assume,
for
a
moment,
that
you
are
right,
that
you
need
something
more...
there
may
be
cases
that
don't
involve
deception,
the
manipulation
word
has
some
meaning.
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
if
you
would
explain
what
elements
you
think
your
complaint
alleges
that
satisfy
the
reading
of
the
statute
you
propose.
i
have
a
little
difficulty
with
why,
other
than
breach
of
contract
and
so
forth,
why
you
say
it
violates
the
statute.
justice
stevens
would
you
say
that
every
breach
of
contract
suit
was
also
a
violation
of
14(e)?
i
guess
arguably
there
was
a
breach
of
contract
here.
one
could
claim
that.
justice
stevens
is
it
essential
in
your
theory
that
there
be
a
breach
of
some
fiduciary
obligation
by
the
inside
management,
by
the
existing
management?
justice
stevens
mr.
bizar,
wouldn't
most
of
these
cases
be
brought
as
class
actions
on
behalf
of
the
entire
body?
justice
stevens
i
know,
but
usually
somebody
gets
there
first
and
that's
the
one
that
proceeds,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
true
of
any
corporate
class
litigation,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
there
are
a
lot
of
them
that
are
rather
successful,
as
i
remember
it.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
aren't
these
problems
that
experts
like
yourself
regularly
deal
with
and
regularly
know
what
state
it's
best
to
proceed
in,
and
it's
part
of
the
daily
business
of
bringing
these
actions?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
point
about
the
locked-up
price,
are
you
contending
the
price
went
up
too
high
or
down
too
low?
justice
stevens
mr.
cherno,
can
i
ask
you
kind
of
a
general
question?
your
opponent
argues
that
we
should
start
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
there
are
three
clauses
in
it
and
the
words
"fraud",
"deception",
and
"manipulation".
justice
stevens
and
he
says
that
if
we
have
added
all
those
words
in
the
word
"manipulation"
must
mean
something
other
than
fraud
or
deception.
what
do
you
think
"manipulation"
means
in
this
statute?
justice
stevens
well,
would
you
say
that...
i'm
not
an
expert
on
the
use
of
these
terms,
but
he
said
somehow
or
other
you
locked
out
a
white
knight
or
scared
him
away
or
did
something
about
a
potential
white
knight.
would
that
be
manipulative?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
we've
got
to
assume
it
did,
i
think,
under
a
12(b)(6)
motion.
justice
stevens
but
assume
for
the
moment
that
everything
was
above-board
in
the
sense
of
full
disclosure
but
the
arrangement
somehow
or
other
gave
special
inducements
to
inside
management,
which
in
turn
made
it
implausible
for
a
third
party
to
make
an
offer
to
take
over
the
company.
is
there
any
set
of
facts
on
which
that
could
ever
violate
14(e)
without
deception?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
and
you
don't
think
congress
was
at
all
concerned
with
that
kind
of
problem
in
the
williams
act?
justice
stevens
mr.
cherno,
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question
about...
i
perhaps
should
ask
your
adversary
this
about
your
understanding
of
the
theory
of
the
complaint.
what
do
you
understand
the
theory
of
damages
to
be...
the
difference
between
what
they
got
and
what
they
would
have
got
under
the
original
offer,
or
the
difference
between
what
they
got
and
what
a
white
knight
might
have
offered?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
wrong
is
withdrawing
the
first
offer
or
the
form
of
the
second
offer.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
the
law
could
contemplate
a
situation
in
which
you
had
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
but
you
might
nevertheless
withdraw
for
an
improper
reason
or
part
of
an
improper
conspiracy.
justice
stevens
mr.
bizar,
can
i
just
ask
you
this
one
question?
is
it
your
view
that
the
wrong
was
the
withdrawal
of
the
first
offer
or
the
making
of
the
second
offer?
justice
stevens
does
it
then
follow
that
if
we
didn't
have
a
first
offer
but
they
just
come
in
with
the
second
offer
and
that's
all
there
was
alleged
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
that?
justice
stevens
i
see.
and,
similarly,
if
they
had
just
made
the
first
offer
and
withdrawn
it
without
the
second
one,
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
that?
justice
stevens
it's
the
agreement
you
say
they
could
have
made
if
they
hadn't
made
the
first
offer?
