justice
rehnquist
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
inflation
of
a
claim
could
have
happened
without
the
phony
burglary,
but
the
phony
burglary
by
itself
wouldn't
have
stated
any
sort
of
a
crime?
justice
rehnquist
but,
of
course,
once
you
get
into
the
business
of
speculation,
i
suppose
you
could
speculate
that
if
the
indictment
was
off
three
or
four
days
as
to
the
time,
even
though
there
was
not
a
material
variance,
you
know,
one
particular
juror
might
have
felt
well,
geez,
it
was
a
little
longer
ago.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
you
can
assume
we
granted
certiorari
on
the
basis
of
the
government's
petition,
your
response,
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which,
of
course,
is
written
out
and
not
necessarily
on
nuances
that
may
not
be
apparent
in
those
papers.
justice
rehnquist
in
this
court
i
think
the
practice
is
if
in
writing
an
opinion
one
is...
the
author
is
going
to
rely
for
part
of
the
conclusions
of
the
opinion
on
something
that
isn't
apparent
in
the
record
but,
rather,
is
dependent
on
the
statement
of
counsel,
then
that
is
footnoted
in
the
opinion.
i
would
assume
the
ninth
circuit
would
do
the
same
thing.
justice
rehnquist
well,
all
we
have
before
us
is
the
written
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
difference
between
one
and
three?
you
say
an
inflated
representation
and
then
you
say
a
grossly
exaggerated.
that's
the
same
thing.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
are
saying
there
are
three
elements
that
the
government
charged
and
one
of
them,
you
say,
is
the
burglary,
the
alleged
burglary.
now
you
say
there
are
two
other
elements?
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you
are
either.

justice
rehnquist
--and
without
the
effort
to
defraud
the
insurance
company
there's
no
mail
fraud?
justice
rehnquist
and
that's
what's
before
us
now...
the
correctness
of
their
decision?
justice
rehnquist
and
you
never...
did
you
make
a
challenge
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
you
move...
you
say
you
were
misled
on
that.
did
you
move
for
a
continuance?
justice
rehnquist
what
was
faked
was
the
insurance
claim.
justice
rehnquist
--well,
i
don't
see
paragraph
7
as
an
addition
or
a
description.
when
they
used
the
term
"grossly
inflated",
that
suggests
that
there
was
some
amount
other
than
the
grossly
inflated
amount
that
would
have
been
correct.
in
other
words,
i
think
when
you
use
the
term
"grossly
inflated"
you're
talking
about
not
a
non-existent
burglary.
you
wouldn't
describe
a
claim
from
that
as
grossly
inflated;
you
would
say
it's
absolutely
false.
"grossly
inflated"
suggests
there
was
some
lesser
claim
that
would
have
been
true.
justice
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
no?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but--
justice
rehnquist
--do
you
disagree
with
me
that
the
term
"inflated"
suggests
an
upward
shifting
of
value
over
an
amount
which
would
have
been
the
true
value?
justice
rehnquist
you
disagree
with
me
on
that.
justice
rehnquist
your
answer
is
yes--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
you
didn't
read
the
indictment
very
carefully,
then.
justice
rehnquist
but
it
isn't
the
instructions
that
you
rely
on
to
put
you
on
notice;
it's
the
indictment.
