mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
the
degree
of
correspondence
that
is
required
between
the
proof
at
trial
and
the
allegations
in
an
indictment.
this
question
is
one
of
great
practical
importance
because
lack
of
correspondence
between
proof
and
charges
in
an
indictment
is
to
some
extent
a
feature
of
a
large
proportion
of
criminal
prosecutions.
this
is
due
to
two
basic
factors.
first
of
all,
as
you
are
well
aware,
the
grand
jury
has
a
different
standard
of
proof
for
returning
an
indictment
from
the
one
the
petty
jury
has
at
trial.
the
indictment
need
be
based
only
on
a
showing
of
probable
cause,
and,
of
course,
it's
entirely
possible
that
a
showing
of
probable
cause
cannot
be
elevated
into
a
showing
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
trial.
secondly,
there
are
often
changes
in
the
availability
of
evidence.
witnesses
may
die,
disappear,
or
cease
cooperation
between
the
time
of
indictment
and
trial,
new
evidence
may
come
to
light
and
the
prosecutor
may
acquire
a
reason
not
to
credit
some
of
the
evidence
that
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury
or
to
feel
it's
not
persuasive
enough
to
justify
presenting
it
to
the
petty
jury.
now
in
this
particular
case
respondent
was
charged
with
three
counts
of
mail
fraud,
and
the
elements
of
the
offense
of
mail
fraud
are,
first,
the
mailing,
second,
an
execution
or
furtherance
of
a
scheme
to
defraud.
the
offense
in
this
indictment
was
described
in
right
paragraphs,
but
the
essential
elements
were
alleged
in
the
first
paragraph
and
the
last
paragraph
of
count
one,
which
is
at
pages
2
and
3
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
last
paragraph
alleges
the
mailing.
the
first
paragraph
alleges
that
respondent
did
devise
and
intend
to
devise
a
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud
and
to
obtain
money
by
means
of
false
and
fraudulent
pretenses
and
representations
from
aetna
insurance
company
by
making
a
fraudulent
insurance
claim
for
a
loss
due
to
an
alleged
burglary
at
san
francisco
scrap
metal.
the
essence
of
this
scheme,
then,
was
to
obtain
money
to
which
respondent
was
not
entitled
by
making
a
false
insurance
claim
in
connection
with
an
alleged
burglary
at
his
place
of
business.
nothing
more
than
paragraph
1
and
8
need
have
been
alleged
in
this
indictment;
however,
in
fact
the
indictment
contained
six
additional
paragraphs,
2
through
7,
describing
the
scheme
in
more
detail.
of
particular
relevance
are
paragraphs
6
and
7.
in
paragraph
6
it
was
alleged
that
it
was
part
of
the
scheme
that
defendant
well
knew
that
the
alleged
burglary
was
committed
with
his
knowledge
and
consent
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
insurance
proceeds.
in
fact,
at
trial
not
enough
evidence
was
put
on
to
establish
this
charge
of
the
grand
jury
or
this
description
of
the
scheme.
in
paragraph
7
the
grand
jury
alleged
that
it
was
a
further
part
of
the
scheme
that
the
defendant
well
knew
that
the
amount
of
copper
claimed
to
have
been
taken
during
the
alleged
burglary
was
grossly
inflated
for
the
purpose
of
fraudulently
obtaining
$150,000
from
aetna
insurance
company.
this
allegation
was
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
trial.
now
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
respondent's
conviction.
it
held
that
the
petty
jury
convicted
miller,
and
i
am
quoting
from
its
opinion
at
6(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
"for
devising
a
scheme
to
defraud
aetna
by
inflating
the
amount
of
the
claimed
loss,
even
though
the
grand
jury
indicted
on
the
basis
of
a
scheme
to
defraud
consisting
not
only
of
the
inflated
claim
but
also
of
miller's
knowing
consent
to
burglary.
"
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
in
a
mail
fraud
case
the
petty
jury
must
find
that
the
defendant
participated
in
the
overall
scheme
alleged
by
the
grand
jury
because
the
court
could
not
be
certain
that
the
grand
jury
would
have
indicted
on
the
basis
that
the
defendant
participated
in
only
a
part
of
the
scheme.
they
go
on
to
say
that
because
it
is
possible
that
if
the
grand
jury
had
seen
only
the
proof
that
the
petty
jury
had
seen
it
would
not
have
chosen
to
indict;
therefore,
the
conviction
should
be
reversed.
now
in
this
court
respondent
relies
principally
not
on
this
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
of
speculation
about
the
grand
jury,
but,
rather,
on
the
more
direct
proposition
that
the
charge
and
the
proof
at
trial
involved
essentially
different
offenses
in
the
sense
that
the
indictment
did
not
really
embrace
the
scheme
for
which
he
was
convicted
and
that,
therefore,
he
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
be
convicted
only
on
an
offense
for
which
he's
been
indicted.
now
let
me
begin
my
legal
argument
with
a
proposition
that
has
generally
been
treated
by
this
court
as
black
letter
law,
and
as
long
ago
as
1896
in
crain
against
the
united
states,
for
instance,
the
court
said
"we
perceive
no
sound
reason
why
the
doing
of
the
prohibited
thing
in
each
and
all
of
the
prohibited
modes
may
not
be
charged
in
one
count
so
that
there
may
be
a
verdict
of
guilty
upon
proof
that
the
accused
has
done
any
one
of
the
things
constituting
a
substantive
crime
under
the
statute.
"
this
same
thought
has
been
expressed
in
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
innumerable
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
now
these
propositions,
this
proposition
would
seem
rather
clearly
to
dispose
of
this
case
in
the
government's
favor.
however,
the
waters
are
somewhat
muddied
by
the
rather
extraordinary
decision
almost
a
century
ago
by
this
court
in
a
case
called
ex
parte
bain.
bain
was
a
case
in
which
the
defendant,
who
was
an
officer
of
a
bank,
was
indicted
for
making
false
statements
in
the
reports
of
the
bank
for
the
purpose
of
deceiving,
and
then
the
indictment
charged,
for
the
purpose
of
deceiving
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
the
agent
appointed
by
the
comptroller
to
inspect
the
affairs
of
the
bank.
at
trial
bain
demurred
to
this
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
did
not
cover
deceiving
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
but
only
his
agent,
and
on
this
basis
the
demur
was
sustained,
whereupon,
the
prosecution,
quite
reasonably,
in
my
view,
said
well,
let
us
strike
the
allegation
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
was
deceived
and
just
leave
the
part
of
the
indictment
charging
deceit
of
his
agent.
this
was
done.
bain
was
convicted.
then,
on
review
in
this
court,
his
conviction
was
reversed,
and
it
was
reversed
on
a
ground
very
similar
to
the
rationale
that
the
ninth
circuit
employed
here;
that
is,
the
court
said
maybe
the
grand
jury
would
have
elected
not
to
indict
had
it
been
presented
only
with
evidence
that
the
agent
was
deceived
and
not
with
what
it
may
have
viewed
as
a
more
serious
matter,
deceiving
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
now
bain
is
a
little
bit
different
from
this
case
because
bain
does
not
involve
a
failure
to
prove
what
was
alleged
in
the
indictment;
that
is,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
in
bain
that
the
proof
that
showed
the
agent
was
deceived
would
act
also
have
showed
that
the
comptroller
was
deceived,
whereas
here
one
of
the
descriptive
paragraphs
in
the
indictment
was
not
in
fact
proved
at
trial.
nevertheless,
the
kind
of
reasoning
that
the
court
used
in
bain
does
very
strongly
support
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
however,
the
continuing
vitality
or
validity
of
bain
can't
be
discussed
here
without
also
considering
the
court's
holdings
40
years
later
in
two
cases...
salinger
against
the
united
states
and
ford
against
the
united
states.
salinger
is
a
case
that
resembles
the
instant
case
quite
closely.
it's
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
charged
in
numerous
counts,
at
least
more
than
seven,
of
a
rather
complicated
mail
fraud
scheme,
and
the
description
in
the
counts
alleged
12
different
means
of
carrying
out
the
scheme
to
defraud.
however,
at
the
close
of
the
evidence
at
trial
it
was
determined
that
only
one
means
alleged
in
one
count
had
been
sufficiently
proven
to
justify
submission
to
the
jury
and
thereupon
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
only
one
of
the
12
means
alleged
in
one
count.
and
salinger
was
convicted.
and
he
appealed,
quite
reasonably
invoking
bain,
and
this
court
said
bain
is
no
problem.
it
proceeded
to
offer
some
rather,
i
think,
insubstantial
distinctions
between
bain
and
salinger,
and
it
said
nobody
could...
i'm
paraphrasing...
nobody
could
seriously
contend
that
salinger's
right
to
indictment
had
been
defeated
by
the
failure
to
prove
most
of
what
was
alleged
in
the
indictment,
as
long
as
what
was
proved
was
sufficient
to
make
out
an
offense.
in
ford,
which
came
along
a
year
later,
the
court
was
confronted
with
a
case
which
was
almost
exactly
like
bain.
in
ford,
what
happened
was
that
the
indictment
charged
a
conspiracy
with
multiple
objectives,
one
of
the
objectives
being
the
violation
of
a
treaty.
and
as
it
turned
out,
the
violation
of
a
treaty
was
not
a
crime
and,
therefore,
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
treaty
was
not
a
crime.
but
the
other
objectives
charged
in
the
indictment
was
in
fact
valid
crimes.
ford
came
to
this
court
invoking
ex
parte
bain,
and,
as
you
see,
the
case
is
quite
parallel
because
ford
involved
a
partial
allegation
of
something
that
was
not
in
fact
a
crime,
just
as
bain
involved
in
part
an
allegation
of
something
that
was
not
a
crime.
and
the
court
said
it's
mere
surplusage
and
it
can
be
ignored.
now
that
would
have
and
in
fact
in
salinger
the
court
used
language
of
limitation,
limiting
salinger
to
its
facts.
that
would
probably
have
been
enough
to
put
bain
to
rest,
except
for
the
fact
that
about
25
years
ago
bain
was
cited
favorably
in
stirone
against
the
united
states
and
then
again
in
russell,
and
that
has
somewhat
raised
the
question
again
as
to
whether
bain
somehow
remains
good
law
despite
what
was
done
to
it
in
salinger
and
ford.
now
let
me
turn
from
a
discussion
of
specific
precedents
to
a
somewhat
broader
effort
to
fit
the
issue
that
is
presented
here
into
the
fabric
of
modern
grand
jury
law
and
considerations
of
logic
and
policy
that
i
think
quite
clearly
suggest
what
the
answer
ought
to
be
in
this
case.
let
me
first
ask
the
question
which
is
involved
in
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
looked
at
this
case,
and
that
is
whether
it
is
a
proper
approach
to
determine
the
fit
between
the
indictment
and
the
proof
at
trial
to
ask
whether
the
grand
jury
might
not
have
indicted
on
the
basis
of
the
proof
at
trial.
now
preliminarily,
before
getting
to
that
question,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
premise
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
here,
speculating
that
the
grand
jury
might
not
have
indicted,
is
a
quite
implausible
premise.
after
all,
the
crime
was
rooking
the
insurance
company
out
of
money
in
connection
with
a
claim
under
a
policy
to
which
respondent
well
knew
he
was
not
entitled,
and
a
substantial
sum
of
money
at
that.
that
was
the
gravamen
of
the
crime.
is
it
really
conceivable
that
a
grand
jury
presented
only
with
a
grossly
inflated
claim
would
have
elected
not
to
indict?
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
phony
burglary
by
itself
would
not
have
stated
mail
fraud
without
a
claim,
but
i
think
what
i
am
saying
is
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
indict,
if
we
are
going
to
speculate...
and
i
don't
believe
we
should...
but
if
we
were
going
to
speculate
about
what
the
grand
jury
might
have
done,
it
seems
to
me
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
seriousness
of
respondent's
conduct
there
is
very
little
difference
between
the
offense
proved
at
trial
and
the
offense
with
the
additional
element
alleged
in
the
indictment
and,
therefore,
such
speculation
in
quite
implausible,
that
the
grand
jury
might
not
have
indicted.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is,
of
course...
that
is,
of
course,
a
problem,
and
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument,
it
is
frequently
the
case
that
there
is
some
lack
of
correspondence
between
the
proof
at
trial
and
the
description
of
the
offense
contained
in
the
indictment.
that's
commonplace.
normally
that
is
treated
as
a
matter
of
variance
and
the
courts
say
we're
going
to
ask
whether
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
by
this
difference
between
what
was
proved
and
what
was
alleged.
and
if
it's
found
that
the
defendant
had
adequate
notice
and
wasn't
prejudiced,
then
the
court
says,
as
it
did
in
berger
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
that
variance
is
immaterial.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
absolutely.
this
entire
case
is
here
on
the
premise
that
the
defendant
was
not
prejudiced,
not
prejudiced
in
fact,
and
the
question
is
whether,
nevertheless,
reversal
of
his
conviction
is
a
per
se
requirement.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
our
contention
would
be
that
the
conviction
could
still
be
affirmed
even
if
the
indictment
had
not
included
paragraph
7.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
he
could
have
known
by
receiving
a
bill
of
particulars.
he
could
have
known
by
receiving
discovery
in
advance
of
what
the
government's--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
there
might
or
might
not
be.
i
mean,
in
this
case
he
would
know
that
he
was
charged
with
making
a
claim
for
money
to
which
he
was
not
entitled
from
the
insurance
company.
now
it
is
possible
that
he
could
be...
without
paragraph
7
that
he
could
be
misled,
but
i
view
that
solely
as
a
problem
of
notice.
that
is,
you
ask
yourself
was
he
in
fact
misled.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
don't
think
that
is--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
that
is
a
purpose
of
the
requirement,
but
i
think
that
is
a
purpose
that
can
be
served
by
other
means,
and
if
served
by
other
means...
that
is,
if
there
were,
for
instance,
a
bill
of
particulars
that
fully
spelled
out
the
theory
of
the
offense
as
it
was
to
be
proved
at
trial...
i
think
there
would
be
no
reason
to
reverse
the
conviction
simply
because
the
defendant
got
one
form
of
notice
rather
than
another.
now
the
indictment
does...
the
right
to
have
a
grand
jury
consider
and
decide
whether
to
return
an
indictment
does
involve
another
important
interest,
and
that
is
the
interest
of
screening
cases
in
order
to
determine
whether
enough
has
been
shown,
that
is,
probable
cause,
to
justify
requiring
the
defendant
to
stand
trial.
now
i
don't
for
one
moment
denigrate
the
value
or
significance
of
that
interest.
there
are
at
least
some
cases
where
grand
juries,
regardless
of
what
a
prosecutor
may
wish
to
do,
may
find
the
probable
cause
has
not
been
shown
and
decline
to
return
an
indictment.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
it's
clear
that
if
paragraphs
2
through
7
were
all
out
there
would
be
no
problem
of
misleading.
there
would...
may
be
the
need
for
further
details.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
conviction
should
be
permitted
to
stand,
but
i
will
admit
that
in
that
kind
of
case
i
would
have
a
problem
with
stirone
and
the
court
would
need
to
reexamine
the
stirone
case.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
understand.
but
suppose
he
did
ask
for
a
bill
of
particulars
and
got
one.
i
think
we
must
put
the
notice
problem
to
one
side
in
this
case,
because
the
reversal
of
this
conviction
does
not
depend
at
all
on
lack
of
actual
notice.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
did
because
respondent
asked
that
they
be
charged
on
the...
that
is,
there
was
a
request
by
the
prosecutor
to
strike
or
not
submit
to
the
jury
specification
6.
that
request
was
resisted,
and
it
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
as
i
intend
to
say
in
just
a
moment,
i
think
there
are
practical
problems
that
are
created
by
that
kind
of...
our
position
is
that
it
would
be
better
to
amend
an
indictment
to
strike
those
specifications
that
are
not
supported
by
proof.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
our
view,
and
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
distinguish
bain
on
the
ground
that
there
was
not
an
actual
physical
change
in
the
indictment.
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
about
the
screening
function,
which
is
fairly
obvious
when
you
think
about
it
for
a
minute,
is
that
it
is
rather
fruitless
to
ask
yourself
whether
the
grand
jury
would
have
found
probable
cause
to
justify
bringing
respondent
to
trial
after
he
has
been
tried
and
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
is,
at
that
point
the
concern
about
the
screening
function
is
greatly
diminished.
the
people
who
are
meant
to
be
protected
primarily
by
the
screening
function
are
people
who
are
going
to
be
acquitted
at
trial
because
there's
not
a
valid
basis
for
charging
them.
this
particular
kind
of
remedy
does
those
people
no
good.
now
the
second
point
that
i
want
to
make
about
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
is
that
the
idea
of
comparing
what
the
grand
jury
may
have
heard
with
what
the
petty
jury
actually
heard
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
line
of
cases
from
holt
through
costello,
lawn,
blue,
and
up
to
calandra,
which
establish
that
the
grand
jury
can
hear
many
kinds
of
evidence
that
would
not
properly
be
admitted
before
the
petty
jury.
so
the
grand
jury
could
return
an
indictment
hearing
only...
having
introduced
before
it
only
some
illegally
seized
evidence
that
can't
be
introduced
at
trial.
now
if
that
is
legitimate,
as
this
court
has
held
it
is,
necessarily
the
petty
jury
will
hear
totally
different
evidence
from
what
the
grand
jury
has
heard.
so
what
is
the
point
of
asking
yourself...
i
mean,
you
are
totally
defeating
this
whole
system
of
allowing
the
grand
jury
to
hear
all
kinds
of
evidence
if
you
are
going
to
reverse
a
conviction
because
the
petty
jury
heard
less
evidence
on
some
points
than
the
grand
jury
heard.
now,
third,
if
you
think
about
it
for
a
moment,
this
idea
of
speculating
about
what
the
grand
jury
would
have
done
if
it
had
heard
evidence
of
a
less
grievous
or
less
culpable
or
less
far-reaching
scheme,
which
is
what
the
petty
jury
heard,
how
could
you
ever
uphold
a
conviction
for
a
lesser
included
offense
or
a
conviction
on
only
one
or
a
few
of
numerous
counts
in
an
indictment?
precisely
the
same
rationale
would
lead
you
say
well,
maybe
if
the
grand
jury
had
only
heard
an
involuntary
manslaughter
case
instead
of
a
murder
case,
or
maybe
if
it
only
heard
larceny
instead
of
armed
robbery,
it
would
not
have
chosen
to
indict
at
all.
so
that
would
mean
that
every
time
somebody
was
convicted
of
a
greater
offense...
indicated
for
a
greater
offense,
convicted
of
a
lesser
included,
you
should
reverse
his
conviction
and
make
the
prosecution
start
all
over
to
see
if
they
can
get
an
indictment
only
for
the
lesser
offense.
now,
fourth,
the
result
reached
in
this
case
provides,
in
practical
terms,
exactly
the
wrong
incentives
to
prosecutors.
first
of
all,
it
tells
the
prosecutors
instead
of
returning
a
rather
comprehensive
indictment
that
describes
the
scheme
as
thoroughly
as
they
see
it
at
the
time
of
indictment,
return
a
bare
bones
indictment
because
you
return
a
bare
bones
indictment,
you
specify
absolutely
the
minimum,
then
you
will
protect
yourself
against
having
a
conviction
reversed
because
it
doesn't
correspond,
because
you
haven't
proved
every
allegation
in
the
indictment.
that
can
hardly
be
in
the
interest
of
defendants
as
a
class,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it
is
in
the
interests
of
the
notice
function
or
the
smooth
functioning
of
the
system.
even
worse,
what
it
does
in
a
case
like
this
is
it
says
to
the
prosecutor
you
may
not
think
the
jury
ought
to
credit
the
false
burglary
evidence,
and
you
may
wish
not
to
present
it
because,
as
you
now
see
the
case,
it's
just
not
credible
and
you
doubt
you
can
establish
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
you'd
better
put
that
evidence
in
anyway.
you
better
put
that
evidence
in
anyway
because
that's
the
only
way
to
protect
yourself
against
the
miller
reversal.
so
it
provides
exactly
the
wrong
incentives.
and,
finally,
it
is
obviously
totally
inconsistent
with
salinger.
i
mean,
in
salinger
you
had
numerous
counts,
you
had
12
specifications,
only
one
of
which
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
you
cannot
possibly
square
a
reversal
here
with
the
court's
affirmance
of
the
conviction
in
salinger.
now,
let
me
turn
to
respondent's
tack
because
i
think
he
does
not
seek
to
rely,
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
the
way
bain
did,
on
this
kind
of
speculation
about
what
the
grand
jury
would
or
might
have
done.
instead
he
seeks
to
persuade
the
court
that
what
was
proved
at
trial
was
in
reality
a
difference
offense
from
the
one
charged
in
the
indictment,
so
that
his
right
to
be
tried
only
on
an
indictment
charging
the
offense
was
violated.
and
he
also
suggests,
without
giving
particulars,
that
he
was
prejudiced
here
by
the
indictment's
failure
to
give
notice.
and
we've
answered
this
contention
in
the
reply
brief
and
i
don't
propose
to
spend
any
more
time
on
that.
but--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
there
was,
and
we
have
lodged
the
transcripts
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding,
but
i
would
say
that
under
costello
and
so
on
i
don't
think
it
would
matter.
we
don't
ask
the
court
to
make
that
kind
of
inquiry
and,
indeed,
if
the
court
thinks
this
case
turns
on
that
and
really
it's
only
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
that
the
claim
has
even
been
sketched
out
of
actual
prejudice
or
actual
prejudicial
lack
of
notice,
it
might
be
appropriate
to
send
it
back
to
look
into
that.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question.
i
mean,
he
had
notice
from
paragraph
7
of
exactly
what
was
proved,
and
i
think
it
may
be
presumed
from
the
presence
of
paragraph
7
in
the
indictment
that
the
grand
jury
heard
some
evidence
to
support
it.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
only,
only
to
that,
in
our
view,
but
surely
at
least
to
that.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
this
particular
case
what
had
happened
was
we
had
not
raised
the
matter
in
our
opening
brief
and
in
the
answering
brief
the
suggestion
was
made,
which
was
really
made
for
the
first
time
in
this
court--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
suggestion?
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
suggestion
was
supported
by
the
record.
now
we
don't
ask
you
to
take
our
word
for
this
at
all.
that
is,
we
are
not
asking
you
to
decide
on
this
basis
because
our
position
is
if
you
think
it
matters
whether
he
had
received
these
materials
or
not,
the
proper
thing
would
be
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
to
have
a
proper
hearing
on
it.
that
is,
we
are
not
asking
you
to
base
your
decision
on
this,
so
i
don't
think
it
raises
a
problem
of
the
kind
that
you
are
concerned
about.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
okay.
well,
let
me
just
come
back
for
a
moment...
i
see
my
time
is
running
short...
to
say
one
thing.
nobody
disagrees
about
the
broadly
stated
proposition
that
a
defendant
should
not
be
convicted
for
an
offense
that
is
different
from
the
one
that
he
has
been
indicted
for.
but
unfortunately
this
proposition
is
virtually
useless
for
deciding
actual
cases,
since,
as
this
case
well
illustrates,
there
can
be
great
disagreement
about
what
constitutes
a
different
offense.
we
don't
think
that's
a
close
question
here,
but
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
to
the
court
how
we
think
different
offense
should
be
defined
for
this
purpose.
we
think
there
should
be
two
inquiries.
first,
are
the
elements
of
the
offense
proved
at
trial
the
same
as
the
elements
of
the
offense,
prove,
that
is.
we
don't
think
you
can
be
indicted
for
bank
robbery
and
convicted
of
arson,
to
take
an
extreme
case,
or
indicted
for
wire
fraud
and
convicted
for
mail
fraud.
the
second
thing
that
should
be
examined
is
whether
the
indictment
concerns
the
same
criminal
transaction
as
the
one
that
the
grand
jury
charged...
that
is,
a
kind
of
unit
of
prosecution.
now
if
this
sounds
a
lot
like
the
double
jeopardy
test,
it
is
because
i
think
you
are
trying
to
make
precisely
the
same
kind
of
inquiry.
anyway,
i
would
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
i
want
to
be
clear
on
one
thing.
the
notion
that
this
is
a
substantially
different
scheme
is
not
part
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
in
its
initial
opinion,
before
we
filed
our
petition
for
rehearing
focusing
on
salinger,
it
had
talked
about
a
substantially
narrower
scheme,
and
the
case
on
which
it
relied,
hastelotto,
dealt
with
a
substantially
narrower
scheme.
we
pointed
out
that
salinger
dealt
with
a
substantially
narrower
scheme,
and
the
way
they
dealt
with
that
was
simply
to
change
the
word
"narrower"
to
"different"
in
their
opinion,
which
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
old
riddle
about
if
you
call
a
horse's
tail
a
leg,
how
many
legs
do
five
horses
have.
of
course,
the
answer
is
not
25,
but
it's
still
20,
because
calling
a
horse's
tail
a
leg
doesn't
make
it
one.
and
in
this
case,
too,
just
calling
the
scheme
substantially
different
will
not
do.
now
when
we
got
to
the
supreme
court
we
have
suddenly
had
suggestions
about
what
happened
or
what
didn't
happen.
if
there
was
a
claim
of
actual
prejudice,
that
claim
should
have
been
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
considered.
if
there
was
a
claim
that
the
indictment
was
inadequate
to
describe
gross
inflation,
that
claim
should
have
been
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
considered
there.
none
of
that
has
to
do
with
the
question
that
is
here
today,
which
is
simply
the
correspondence
between
the
indictment
and
the
proof.
and
let
me
close
with
one
other
question
that
i
think
the
court
needs
to
think
about:
if
miller
is
right
and
the
ninth
circuit
is
right
here,
what
happens
with
this
case?
are
we
barred
from
reprosecuting
it
at
all,
or
can
we
go
back
and
return
an
indictment
which
is
pegged
to
paragraph
7
and
reprosecute
this
case?
now
i
think
it's
important
to
think
about
that
because
the
result,
if
we
are
barred,
we
are
being
barred
from
prosecuting
a
case
even
though
we
have
proved
guilt
of
a
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
simply
because
of
a
defect
in
the
way
the
case
was
indicted
relative
to
the
way
the
case
was
tried,
which
is
not
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
really
concerned
with.
if
we're
not
barred,
which
i
think
must
be
the
result,
from
going
back,
getting
a
new
indictment
charging
the
same
scheme
based
only
on
the
narrower
description
of
it,
then
we're
sure
that's
the
way
we
want
the
system
to
work.
