mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
problem
presented
before
reaching
the
merits
of
the
question
of
overruling
bain,
as
the
government
seeks
to
do,
is
more
fundamental
for
a
reviewing
court
than
perhaps
any
case
that
i
have
been
able
to
review
and
see
in
this
court.
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
trial
transcript
before
the
ninth
circuit.
it
is
a
case
in
which
there
was
nothing
but
stipulated
facts
of
a
rather
bare
bones
nature
before
the
circuit.
at
the
circuit
court
argument,
the
oral
argument,
the
question
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant
arose
and
i
again
repeated
for
that
court,
to
the
three
justices
sitting,
that
we
were
prejudiced,
as
we
had
alleged
in
our
reply
brief
in
that
court.
it
is
impossible
to
tell,
of
course,
from
the
opinion
that
is
before
this
court
what
reaction
the
circuit
court
had
in
that
respect
because
the
questions
of
the
circuit
court
to
counsel
at
argument
and
the
replies
of
counsel
are
nowhere
in
this
record.
indeed,
last
week
i
received
by
federal
express
from
the
solicitor
general
a
grand
jury
transcript
which
had
not
been
ever
provided
prior
to
trial,
which
no
one,
neither
the
district
court
nor
myself
nor
the
court
of
appeals
had
ever
seen
before
but
which
is
now
lodged
before
this
court.
it's
the
testimony
of
agent
humphrey
summarizing
the
case,
and
in
that
particular
transcript,
which
i
assume
the
united
states
has
obtained
pursuant
to
an
order
of
release
of
the
grand
jury
transcript
under
rule
6(e),
or
i
hope
i'm
not
contempt
in
having
it,
even
though
i
didn't
call
for
it,
but
it
was
handed
to
me
by
the
government,
in
that
particular
transcript,
unknown
to
all
of
us
below,
and
particularly
to
the
ninth
circuit,
one
of
the
grand
jurors
began
an
inquiry
into
whether
or
not
they
needed
to
deal
with
the
inflated
value
of
the
copper.
and
another
grand
juror
said
no,
no,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
that.
it
wasn't
ever
stolen.
these
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
may
have
led,
particularly
justice
pregerson,
to
the
conclusions
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
dealing
with
as
to
whether
or
not
the
case
ever
would
have
been
indicted.
those
were
the
questions
asked
at
the
ninth
circuit
oral
argument.
this
is
a
most
inappropriate
case,
under
these
circumstances,
for
this
court
to
begin
to
speculate
about
what
the
ninth
circuit
thought
it
had
before
it,
because
what
went
on
at
the
ninth
circuit
is
again
partially
hidden
from
this
court.
the
government
originally
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
they
would
live
with
certain
facts
in
the
courts.
they
tried
to
get
out
of
that
in
the
ninth
circuit.
they
have
now
lodged
materials
which
either
were
never
available
before
or
which
have
been
produced,
such
as
the
trial
transcript,
but
were
never
available
to
the
ninth
circuit.
and
indeed
it
is
the
most
inappropriate
vehicle
for
the
granting
of
certiorari,
let
alone
the
determination
that
it
stands
as
a
proper
vehicle
to
go
back
into
the
system,
saying
this
is
where
the
ninth
circuit
erred.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
well,
i
do
assume
that,
but
what
i
could
not
assume
and
i'm
sure
was
not
apparent
to
the
court
is
that
the
government
seeks
to
rely
now
upon
materials
which
were
never
mentioned
in
the
petition
for
cert,
let
alone
the--
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
--he
did
say
that
to
you
because
i
think
that
he
wishes
to
be
in
a
position
in
which
he
can
counter
the
statement
of
trial
counsel
that
we
were
prejudiced
without
having
you
look
into
the
matters
which
indicate
that
in
fact...
pardon
me,
that
we
were
not
prejudiced,
by
having
you
not
look
into
the
facts
as
they
existed
below.
i
think
that
is
a
terrible
mistake
because
it
denigrates
the
whole
process
into
one
in
which,
as
a
reviewing
court,
you
are
accepting
propositions
that
were
different
from
the
ones
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
naive
to
suggest
that
court
of
appeals
justices
do
not
listen
to
what
is
said
in
oral
argument
in
making
decisions
of
the
type
that
that
court
made
in
the
miller
case.
the
substantially
different
scheme
language
which
is
used
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
must
to
some
extent
arise
from
the
inquiry
that
they
made
at
the
oral
argument
in
respect
to
these
matters
in
which
a
government
counsel
sat
to
my
left
and
never
contradicted
a
statement
which
was
made
in
my
reply
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit,
which
again
is
never
contradicted
until
a
week
before
oral
argument
the
government
desires
to
send
matters
to
this
court
over
the
transom,
so
to
speak,
and
say
here
they
are
but
don't
look
at
them.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
they
do
on
occasion
and
they
don't
on
other
occasions.
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
representations.
since
the
representation
of
prejudice
was
in
the
reply
briefs
but
not
addressed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
but
the
oral
argument
focused
on
that
area--
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
--that's
correct,
and
it's
in
that
respect
that
that
opinion
breaks
no
unusual
new
ground.
it
states
essentially
that
there
is
one
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud.
the
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud
is
made
up
of
three
elements.
one
is
the
inflation
of
the
insurance
limits.
two
is
the
alleged
burglary.
and,
three,
as
a
component
element,
is
a
"grossly
exaggerated"
claim.
that--
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
--well,
"grossly
inflated"
is
the
language
used
in
the
indictment.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
no,
i
think
i'm
not
being
clear.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
without
the
mailing,
there
is
no
mail
fraud.
that's
the
reason
count
three
was
dismissed.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
that's
right.
that
effort
to
defraud,
the
fraud
is
made
up
of
a
scheme
which
involved
miller
setting
forward
to
do
a
particular
action,
and
it's
that
basis
that
the
ninth
circuit
determined
and
made
a
finding
that
the
grand
jury
indicated.
it
was
a
scheme
and
one
which
they
reviewed
and
viewed
as
a
different
one
if
the
first
two
elements
were
missing.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
that's
right.
they
found
that
neither...
they
found
a
substantially
different
scheme,
and,
as
the
trial
transcript
shows
or
as
the
stipulated
facts
show,
there
was
an
absence
of
the
raising
of
the
inflated
claim,
and
there
was
an
absence
of
the
consented-to
burglary.
all
that,
the
facts
demonstrate,
is
that
mr.
miller
had
not
bought
a
certain
amount
of
copper
from
a
couple
of
companies.
the
jury
believed
after
the
trial
that
that
was
sufficient
because
the
trial
judge
told
them
that
if
you
find
that
there
was
a
willful
exaggeration
of
claim
that's
enough
in
this
case.
it
was
that
issue
with
which
we
took
contention.
that's
contained
in
the
trial
transcript
with
respect
to
objections
to
the
instructions,
which
are
premised
on
the
same
point
that
is
made
in
this
court.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
no.
we
made
a
challenge
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
a
scheme,
and
i
think
that's
slightly
different.
that
was
the
contention
made
in
the
district
court.
in
terms
of
the
instruction
which
judge
peckham
gave
to
the
jury,
then
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
evidence
and
was
evidence
that
the
claim
had
been
inflated.
it
was
more
than
what
could
be
proven
to
have
been
on
the
premises.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
oh,
yes,
indeed.
the
problem
came
when
the--
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
--the
witness
came
and
said
i
am
the
insurance
broker.
i
suggested
raising
these
insurance
limits.
it
was
not
mr.
miller's
idea
and
he
left
the
trial.
so
that
was
the
failure
of
proof
in
respect
to
the
idea
that
miller
had
concocted
anything
in
respect
to
raising
the
insurance
levels.
a
great
deal
of
the
trial
was
spent
in
countering
government
evidence
that
the
burglary
was
a
fake.
much
of
the
trial
testimony
related
to
alarm
people,
experts,
to
a
police
officer
and
the
rest,
who
were
saying
something
was
wrong
with
the
break-in.
that
is
why
we
had
focused
and
were
led
to
focus
by
the
prosecution
upon
a
defense
based
on
a
consented-to
or
faked
burglary,
and
it
wasn't
until
the
very
last
part
of
the
trial,
almost
the
closing
of
the
trial,
that
the
key
witness
for
whom
all
of
this
foundation
had
been
laid
by
the
prosecution,
who
was
to
walk
in
and
stand
upon
a
stage
of
evidence
which
inferred
that
there
was
a
fake
burglary,
mr.
fisher,
did
not
appear.
and
at
that
point
the
prosecution,
finding
that
they
could
not
call
mr.
fisher
after
they
had
arrested
him
and
been
unable
to
persuade
him
to
testify,
decided
to
change
theories,
and
it
was
that
which
we
told
the
court
of
appeals
we
were
hurt
by.
it
is
that
which
the
court
of
appeals
says
that's
a
different
scheme
that
you
faced.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
i
have
trouble
with
the
word
"focus".
it
certainly...
mr.
robinson
had
said
i'm
not
going
to
mention
mr.
fisher
because
we're
looking
for
him.
we
have
a
warrant
out
for
him.
i
want
to
be
cautious.
so
we
all
understood
he
wasn't
going
to
say
something.
he
then
proceeded
to
do
that.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
no,
act
to
me
in
the
defense
of
that
case.
mr.
robinson
said
i
expect
to
get
fisher
here
because
we're
going
to
arrest
him
and
bring
him
in
on
a
matter
witness
warrant.
we
have
gotten
immunity
for
him.
he
has
counsel.
but
i'm
just
going
to
take
it
easy
here
in
case
i
have
a
problem.
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
trouble
i'm
in
is
the
statement
that
mr.
robinson
made
in
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
so
we
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
fisher
was
going
to
make
a
grand
entrance
and
we
prepared
for
the
case
on
that
line.
we
also
were
told
by
the
government
that
they
would
not
give
us
the
statements
of
fisher
on
others
until
five
days
before
trial.
even
though
the
solicitor
general
has
mentioned
that
the
assistant
has
advised
them
that
it
was
a
month
and
a
half
before
trial,
there
is
a
letter
in
the
material
furnished
to
this
court,
addressed
to
me
from
mr.
robinson,
which
says
i
am
still
holding
back
until
five
days
before
trial
before
i
give
you
materials.
we
started
the
case.
we
defended
the
case,
and
we
proceeded
through
the
trial
of
the
case,
understanding
that
the
false
burglary,
some
allegations
of
some
arson
or
tampering-like
conduct
by
miller,
and
the
action
of
his
accomplice,
fisher,
was
the
underpinning
of
the
case.
we
focused
the
defense
in
that
respect,
and
in
so
doing
we
were
led
to
a
very
serious
prejudicial
position
when
the
case
fell
apart
in
respect
to
both
the
inflated
insurance
limits
evidence
and
fisher's
failure
to
show
up,
and
the
failure
to
be
able
to
prove
a
false
burglary.
so
in
that
respect
if
this
court--
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
--no,
on
the
basis
that
once
that
case
had
stopped,
fisher
didn't
show,
the
government
rested,
we
put
on
the
short
amount
of
evidence
that
we
had,
which
had
to
do,
again,
with
whether
or
not
mr.
miller
was
a
man
running
a
substantial
copper
business
and
had
no
motive
to
fake
a
burglary,
because
the
jury
had
kept
hearing
time
after
time
about
inferences,
something
is
faked
about
the
burglary,
but
he
never
got
quite
to
the
point
during
the
case.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
yes,
but
the
government's
position
in
proceeding
with
that
is
that
the
burglary
was
faked
and,
therefore,
the
claim
of
the
burglary,
of
any
burglary
at
all,
was
wrong.
the
inflation
aspect
we
fought
from
the
standpoint
that
all
of
that
evidence
as
to
how
much
the
copper
was
worth
or
how
much
the
trucks
were
worth,
which
was
also
part
of
the
claim
that
had
been
faked,
was
probative
of
miller's
state
of
mind
regarding
a
false
burglary.
this
indictment,
the
minute
you
begin
to
read
it,
does
nothing
but
continue
to
state
that
everything
is
premised
upon
a
false
burglary.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
i
think
that--
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
--we
certainly
were
on
notice
that
the
government
claimed
that
there
was
no
copper
on
the
premises,
except
for
a
bale
or
two,
from
the
material
we
received.
that
is
the
way
the
government
had
represented
it
was
going
to
proceed
in
the
case,
and
we
defended,
to
some
extent,
against
that.
when
the
government's
theory
switched
at
the
end
of
the
trial
to
the
idea
that
what
really
is
involved
here
is
solely
an
inflated
claim
and
nothing
else,
we
had
not
at
that
point
been
in
a
position
to
contest
all
of
the
value
of
all
the
materials.
the
focus
in
the
defense--
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
--well,
i
think
this
is
the
problem
with
the
defense
of
a
criminal
case
in
this
spot.
you
take
a
theme,
you
listen
to
what
the
government
purports
it
is
going
to
put
on
and
what
their...
the
underpinning
of
their
case
is,
and
you
prepare
to
meet
that.
and
to
the
extent
that
we
did
not
run
a
defense
saying
well,
we're
going
to
attack
the
question
of
the
economic
amount
of
the
loss
and
then
at
the
same
time
run
a
defense
saying
that
we
are
going
to
show
that
miller
is
an
operating
businessman
who
wouldn't
think
of
burglary,
i
felt...
and
that's
my
responsibility...
that
those
two
defenses...
i
could
dilute
our
position
from
those
two
defenses
if
i
didn't
focus
on
where
the
government
was
coming
from
with
respect
to
mr.
fisher.
so
to
the
extent
that
we
did
not
go
on
and
do
that,
we
can
say
the
defendant
was
incompetently
represented
by
reason
of
counsel's
determination
that
one
theme
made
the
most
sense,
and
it
did,
based
upon
what
had
been
told
to
us
and
what
i
perceived
was
the
underpinning
of
the
government's
case,
both
as
represented
by
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
but,
more
importantly,
because
i
had
lived
with
that
case
and
understood
what
it
was
that
was
the
underpinning
of
the
scheme.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
you
see
the
case
in
the
condition
that
it
is,
with
paragraph
7
as
an
addition
or
description
of
part
of
the
scheme.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
no.
i
think
that--
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
--one
dollar
is
grossly
inflated
when
you
understand
the
government's
position
was
this
burglary
never
happened.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
if...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
yes.
and
the
"grossly"
is
an
adjective
added
to
that.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
no,
i
don't.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
i
do
agree
with
you
that
the
word
"inflated"
means
an
upward
shifting;
"grossly
inflated"
means
even
more
of
an
upward
shifting.
i
didn't
treat
that
and
i
don't
treat
that
in
respect
to
the
way
this
case
was
presented
as
meaning
that
anything
over
one
or
two
bales
of
copper,
which
is
all
that
was
ever
testified
to
really
exist
on
the
premises,
meant
anything
more
than
a
few
dollars
or
a
claim
that
something
happened
that
didn't.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
well,
neither
did
the
government
ask
for
any
instruction
to
the
jury
as
to
what
"inflated"
meant.
no
one
knew
what
the
government
meant
by
that,
because
i
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
the
false
burglary
claim
was
the
scheme;
the
government
was
satisfied
at
trial
to
have
an
instruction
from
the
trial
judge
that
any
faking
of
the
claim,
any
increase
whatsoever,
was
necessary.
the
government
disregarded
its
own
language
in
that
respect.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
instructions,
"grossly
inflated"
is
never
mentioned,
never
defined,
never
delineated
to
the
jury.
they
are
simply
told
that
a
willful
and
deliberate
false
insurance
claim
is
sufficient.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
no,
it
is...
the
indictment
starts
the
notice,
but
what
theory
the
government
will
use
is
evidenced
by
the
ongoing
process
of
the
trial.
in
the
preparation
of
that
defense,
what
instructions
are
presented
by
the
trial...
by
the
government
is
part
of
the
preparation
for
that
defense,
and
that
preparation
depends
upon
what
you
see
the
government
putting
in.
when
they
give
you
the
instructions,
as
judge
peckham
requires,
in
advance
of
trial,
and
you
go
through
them,
you
see
what
they
are--
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
--discussions
were
had
on
a
regular
basis
in
attempting
to
settle
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
we
are
discouraged
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
from
making
those
kind
of
motions
because
they
are
pursued
in
discovery.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
no.
no,
but
you
are
discouraged
from
it,
and
when
the
chief
judge
of
the
united
states
district
court
practices
his...
runs
his
court
in
a
certain
manner,
then
you
follow
that.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
the
government
was
talking
to
me
regularly
about
what
they
felt
the
case
was
all
about.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
certainly
not.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
because
i
didn't
take
the
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
misunderstands
the
case.
the
government
had
an
opportunity,
if
they
wished,
to
have
supplemented
this
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
by
ordering
the
trial
transcript
and
presenting
material
to
those
justices
so
that
they
could
deal
with
these
kind
of
problems.
and
yet
at
no
time,
including
the
petition
for
rehearing
or
supplemental
petition,
did
anyone
in
the
government
seek
to
do
that.
the
trial
transcript
wasn't
prepared
until
the
solicitor
general's
office
decided
they
wanted
to
read
it,
and
that
is
when
much
of
this
material
began
to
filter
into
the
case.
so
that
the
difficulty
with
much
of
what
is
said
here
is
that
it's
not
for
the
ninth
circuit
below.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
no.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
that's
correct.
we
presented
a
certain
set
of
facts
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
made
certain
representations,
both
sides,
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
justices
listened
to
that
and
then
they
wrote
an
opinion
and
it's
that
opinion
that
the
government
contests,
and
the
court
of
appeals
read
that
indictment,
and
i
think
they
say
so
very
clearly
in
their
opinion,
to
charge
one
scheme,
which
was
substantially
different
than
the
one
they
heard
and
believed
was
tried.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
ex
parte...
i
do.
ex
parte
bain
is
a
decision
raising
to
a
proper
level
the
grand
jury
protection
that
a
citizen
should
have.
ex
parte
bain
is
a
case
which
has
caused,
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
same
cases,
no
substantial
confusion
in
the
courts.
it
is...
there's
no
argument
with
the
fact.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
i
believe...
yes.
i
believe,
for
example,
that
stirone,
which
involved
simply
the
interstate
transportation
or
the
interstate
movement
of
a
product,
is
far
different
than
bain's
protection
because
stirone
alleged
and
dealt
only
with
the
aspect
of
whether
or
not
a
jurisdictional
element
had
been
met.
the
extortion
is
the
crime,
much
like
the
scheme
is
the
crime
here.
and,
therefore,
the
change
in
respect
to
whether
the
sand
came
from
pennsylvania
or
whether
it
was
steel
that
was
involved,
leaving
aside
the
prospective
shipments
which
the
supreme
court
decided
to
ignore
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
dealt
with,
simply
did
not
raise
any
new
issue
or
deal
with
any
difficulty
with
the
proposition
that
the
grand
jury
indictment
must,
even
though
it
may
cover
up
guilt
from
time
to
time
in
respect
to
the
double
jeopardy
protections
that
the
solicitor
general
is
interested
in,
that
bain
simply
did
not
change
any
fundamental
protection.
what
this
court
is
embarking
upon
if
it
overrules
bain
is
to
make
a
truism
out
of
the
criticism
that
is
leveled
at
the
grand
jury
in
the
federal
system
today,
that
what
it
does
doesn't
mean
anything
because
we'll
figure
out
afterwards
whether
the
defendant
looked
like
he
was
guilty
of
something
pretty
close.
if
the
scheme
and
the
trial
simply
narrow
the
charges,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
the
problem
in
this
case
in
respect
to
bain
is
that
the
grand
jury
indicted
for
something
totally
different.
that
proposition
should
not
be
changed.
bain
should
not
be
overruled
because
bain
affords
an
important
protection;
it's
one
that
requires
that
there
really
be
some
screening
process.
and
in
that
respect,
if
this
court
were
to
believe
that
you
should
proceed
to
analyze
those
cases,
then
i
suggest
the
materials
lodged
by
the
government
be
carefully
read,
because
when
you
see
the
process
of
the
grand
jury
in
those
materials
you
will
see
that
the
protection
was
in
fact
operating
and
that
if
mr.
fisher
had
not
testified,
there
would
most
likely
have
been
no
indictment.
that
proposition
is
what
is
stated
in
bain.
it
doesn't
require
any
speculation
any
more
because
i
think
these
materials
demonstrate
that.
i
am
just
somewhat
sad
that
it
starts
only
here
in
this
court.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
yes.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
no.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
no.
we
simply
came
back
for
sentencing
and
at
the
sentencing
time
he
said
the
motion
will
be
denied.
therefore,
nothing,
either
oral
or
written,
that
indicated
the
process
by
which
he
had
reached
the
denial.
in
closing,
i
believe,
and
i
think
that
the
cases
support,
the
proposition
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
the
bain
rationale,
the
idea
that
we
should
equate
an
analysis
of
the
trial
with
what
the
grand
jury
generally
may
have
indicted
on
is
not
a
sound
vehicle
for
distinguishing
all
of
the
cases
that
the
prosecution
has
cited.
the
overruling
of
bain
would
cause
a
fundamental
shift
in
the
process.
none
of
the
policy
arguments
that
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
are
really
problems
which
can't
be
addressed
by
a
more
careful
analysis
of
cases
by
prosecutors
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
mr.
jerrold
m.
ladar
certainly
not.
they
may
withdraw
any
count
that
they
wish,
because
each
count
is
a
separate
allegation.
they
also,
just
as
mr.
frey
suggested,
if
suppressed
evidence
is
taken
out
of
the
case,
as
long
as
you
proceed
to
prove
the
scheme
and
artifice,
or
the
narcotic
transaction
that
was
alleged,
you
can
do
it
by
any
evidence
coming
in
from
anywhere.
the
question
is
whether
you
are
still
proceeding
on
the
same
scheme
and
artifice.
that
is
the
nub
of
this
case,
not
the
kind
of
case
in
which
the
scheme
and
artifice
stays
the
same
but
they're
bringing
different
witnesses
to
testify
to
the
scheme.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
this
latter
proposition.
it
is
the
first
proposition
that
is
difficult,
and
each
of
those
cases
cited
by
the
government
is
one
in
which
there
was
not
any
fundamental
change
in
the
charge,
the
extortion
or
the
scheme.
it
simply
was
a
change
in
evidence
in
the
trial
court.
that
is
not
what
had
happened
in
this
case.
thank
you.
