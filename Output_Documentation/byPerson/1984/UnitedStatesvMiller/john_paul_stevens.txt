justice
stevens
mr.
frey,
could
i
go
back
for
just
a
second
to
your
suggestion
that
the
indictment
would
have
been
sufficient
even
without
paragraph
7?
are
you
saying
that
assuming
also
that
paragraphs
3,
4,
5
and
6
were
omitted,
or
were
you
saying
it
would
be
sufficient
to
describe
a
conspiracy
that
seemed
to
depend
entirely
on
the
phony
theft
on
the
one
hand,
or
one
that
was
just
a
general
description?
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
that
if
it
were
all
left
out--
justice
stevens
--but
would
you
say
the
indictment,
this
conviction
could
stand
if
the
indictment
included
paragraphs
1
through
6
and
not
paragraph
7?
justice
stevens
because
then
there
would
presumably
be
no
reason
to
ask
for
a
bill
of
particulars,
because
he
would
have
thought
well,
the
issue
is
whether
there
was
really
a
burglary.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
also.
is
there
any
relevance...
i
take
it
the
indictment,
this
is
different
from
bain
because
there
was
not
in
fact
a
striking
of
the
paragraph
that
turned
out
to
be
superfluous.
justice
stevens
but
did
the
indictment
itself
go
to
the
jury?
they
apparently
knew
what
the
entire
charge
was.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
really
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you...
what
your
views
are,
would
be
with
regard
to
the
correct
procedure
when
this
problem
develops.
would
it
not
be
better
to
simply
strike
the
allegations
entirely
so
that
you
only
have
the
jury
knowing
that
the
government
at
least
thought
that
this
was
a
phony
theft?
justice
stevens
mr.
frey,
since
you've
mentioned
the
reply
brief,
i
just
want
to
mention
one
thing
in
that
brief
that
troubles
me
a
little
bit.
you
have...
on
page
4
you
say
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
tried
this
case
advises
us
that
a
month
and
a
half
before
trial
he
provided
exhibits
and
the
like.
i
notice
in
several
briefs
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
in
this
argument
session
you
have
given
us
material
that's
not
in
the
record,
and
i
just
wonder
if
it's
a
practice
that
you
think
should
be
followed
by
defense
counsel
and
the
solicitor
general
and
everyone,
or
should
we
try
to
stick
to
the
record.
justice
stevens
was
it
supported
by
the
record,
the
suggestion
that
was
made?
justice
stevens
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
correct
answer
to
a
contention
that's
not
supported
by
the
record
is
simply
that
the
record
doesn't
support
that
contention,
not...
well,
anyway
i
just
want
you
to
know
i
see
this
in
a
number
of
your
briefs
lately,
this
sort
of
thing.
justice
stevens
very
well.
mr.
ladar.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
you,
if
i
may,
there.
paragraph
7
is
not.
paragraph
7
quite
clearly
alleges
a
grossly
inflated
claim,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
would
state
a
claim
for
a
cause
of
action
in
civil
terms
if...
even
without
the
false
burglary.
justice
stevens
and,
therefore,
it
would
seem
to
me
you
would
have
been
on
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
government
was
going
to
prove
the
copper
was
not
worth
$123,000.
justice
stevens
well,
why
not?
i
don't
understand.
it
seems
to
me
that
full
trial
preparation
would
have
required
that
you
do
everything
you
could
to
resist
that
claim
as
well
as
the
balance
of
it.
i
don't
understand
why
you--
justice
stevens
speaking
to
that
point,
mr.
ladar,
may
i
ask
you,
the
motions
you
made
before
judge
peckham
were
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
both
before
and
after
the
verdict,
i
gather.
justice
stevens
and
i
notice
that
he
says
the
ruling
will
be
reserved,
and
he
eventually
denied
it.
did
he
write
an
opinion?
justice
stevens
he
did
not.
