even
before
the
instructions,
you
could
have
cleared
that
up
by
more
specific
allegations
in
the
indictment,
couldn't
you?
couldn't
you
have

them
what
they
meant
by
"grossly"?

discouraged?
justice

my
question
is
are
you
prohibited?
justice
marshall
well,
is
all
of
that
in
the
record?
justice
marshall
well,
i
know
it's
not.
why
isn't
some
of
it
in
the
record
if
you're
relying
on
it?
justice
marshall
is

this
difficulty
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
send
for
this
material
on
its
own?
justice
marshall
well,
for
instance,
i
assume
counsel's
supposed
to
do
something.
