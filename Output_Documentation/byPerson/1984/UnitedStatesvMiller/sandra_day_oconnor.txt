justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
agree
that
we
should
retain
the
concept
of
examining
prejudice
to
the
defendant?
justice
o'connor
would
the
result
be
different
if
the
indictment
had
not
included
paragraph
7?
justice
o'connor
but
how,
then,
would
the
defendant
have
known
that
he
ought
to
prepare
by
having
witnesses
as
to
value
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
oh,
but
there
would
be
nothing
to
tip
the
defendant
off
under
those
circumstances
that
he
ought
to
even
be
making
an
inquiry,
would
there?
justice
o'connor
so
you
think
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
fifth
amendment's
grand
jury
indictment
requirement
is
to
put
the
defendant
on
notice?
justice
o'connor
no?
justice
o'connor
well,
on
that
point,
apparently
there
was
some
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
i
gather,
that
there
was
an
inflated
burglary.
justice
o'connor
an
inflated
loss.
justice
o'connor
and
the
prosecutor's
opening
statement
at
trial
referred
to
the
inflated
insurance
claim?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
government
said
it
was
not
relying
on
it,
and
it
did
not
ask
us
to
consider
that
in
rendering
a
decision.
that's
what
i
just
understood
mr.
frey
to
be
saying.
justice
o'connor
and
there
was
evidence
of
the
increase
in
the
insurance
coverage?
justice
o'connor
and
the
mailing?
justice
o'connor
well,
did
the
opening
statement
not
focus
on
the
exaggerated
insurance
claim
to
the
exclusion
of
the
reference
to
the
phoney
burglary?
justice
o'connor
well,
wasn't
that
clear
at
that
stage,
that
the
government
was
talking
just
about
the
inflated
insurance
claim
in
the
opening
statement?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
ladar,
on
the
supposition
that
some
of
us
on
this
court
might
read
paragraph
7
in
a
way
which
you
don't,
apparently,
do
you
plan
to
address
the
legal
arguments
involved,
beginning
with
ex
parte
bain
and
the
issues
that
the
solicitor
general
addressed?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
stirone
and
salinger
and
ford
and
bain
are
all
easily
reconciled
with
each
other?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
there
is
a
multi-count
indictment,
grand
jury
indictment?
do
you
think
that
the
government
is
precluded
from
offering
evidence
and
convicting
on
only
one
of
the
multi-counts?
