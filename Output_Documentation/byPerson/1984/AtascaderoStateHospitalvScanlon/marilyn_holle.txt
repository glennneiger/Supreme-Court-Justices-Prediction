ms.
marilyn
holle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
before
i
respond
to
the
points
raised
by
mr.
ryan,
i
would
like
to
summarize
our
position
in
this
case.
section
504
represents
a
major
political
victory
for
handicapped
persons,
really
a
political
victory
akin
to
that
won
by
blacks
in
the
civil
rights
acts
of
1964
and
1968.
the
language
of
504
is
elegant
and
majestic
in
its
sweep.
the
language
of
504
imposes
substantial
obligations
on
state
programs
receiving
aid.
the
language
of
504
also
confers
important
rights
on
handicapped
persons,
including
the
right
to
go
to
court
to
enforce
the
promise
of
504.
the
state
does
not
disagree
with
any
of
that.
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
in
this
case
is
do
an
end
run
around
the
clear
will
of
congress
by
interposing
the
eleventh
amendment
bar.
we
believe
there
are
three
reasons
for
upholding
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
first,
the
first
reason,
when
congress
drafted
and
enacted
504,
it
intended
to
create
a
federal
civil
right,
enforceable
in
federal
court
against
any
and
all
recipients,
including
the
states.
indeed,
a
review
of
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
states
were
a
primary
target
of
the
504
legislation.
when
congress
went
back
to
504
in
1978,
congress
went
back
to
enhance
and
extend
504,
and
to
underscore
its
broad
remedial
purposes.
the
second
reason,
under
california
state
law,
california
has
waived
its
immunity
to
suit
in
federal
court
under
the
federal
civil
rights
claim.
beyond
that,
under
both
federal
and
state
law,
california
has
consented
to
suit.
that
consent
follows
from
receipt
of
federal
financial
assistance
knowing
of
the
substantive
obligations
imposed,
receipt
of
federal
financial
assistance
knowing
it
means
liability
to
suit,
and
receipt
of
federal
financial
assistance
knowing
that
when
the
state
denies
a
job
to
someone
because
of
his
or
her
handicap,
504
rights
are
involved.
ms.
marilyn
holle
no,
i
have
not.
if
i
may--
ms.
marilyn
holle
--yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
the
third
reason
is
that
where
federal
rights
are
concerned,
there
is
no
eleventh
amendment
bar
to
suit,
particularly
with
respect
to
a
federally
created
civil
right.
there
is
no
need
to
employ
the
ex
parte
young
fiction.
and
maybe
in
terms
of
the
points
raised
by
mr.
ryan
i
should
address
first
the
states
issue
at
the
suggestion
of
justice
rehnquist.
this
court
had
occasion
to
look
very
carefully
at
california
sovereign
immunity
doctrines
in
a
case
which
came
to
it
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
that
was
nevada
v.
hall.
in
that
case
there
were
some
members
of
this
court
who
did
not
like
the
fact
that
california
imposed
its
policy
of
no
sovereign
immunity
on
a
sister
state.
i
think
by
looking
at
that
case
as
well
as
cases
developed
in
california,
i
think
it
will
be
clear
that
california
has
waived
sovereign
immunity.
i
think
the
california
constitutional
provision
and
the
california
statute
should
be
looked
at
in
the
light
suggested
by
justice
stevens
in
his
footnote
in
patsy.
ms.
marilyn
holle
yes,
i
have,
and
indeed
in
that
case
this
court
recognized
that
somehow
california
was
different
when
it
analyzed
the
outcome
and
the
reasons
for
the
outcome
in
smith
v.
reeves,
and
it
really
contrasted
california
with
other
states.
it
approved
of
the
outcome,
because
what
was
involved
was
a
state
taxing
statute,
sort
of
a
subject
which
has
been
traditionally
left
to
the
states.
indeed,
i
mean,
it
is
dealing
with
something
which
is
within
the
traditional
sovereign
immunity
interests
of
a
state,
that
is,
to
define
when
and
where
and
how
state-created
rights
can
be
enforced,
as
was
done
in
pennhurst,
or
rights
bottomed
on
state-created
rights,
as
was
the
result
of
hans.
ms.
marilyn
holle
i
think
if
you
look
at
muskopf--
ms.
marilyn
holle
--i
think
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
legislature
has
affirmatively
imposed
a
limitation
so
as
to
bar
discriminatees
from
suit
in
federal
court
under
504
or
any
other
civil
rights
statute.
ms.
marilyn
holle
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
muskopf
would
indicate
that
in
california
sovereign
immunity
concepts
have
been
swept
away.
ms.
marilyn
holle
the
test
would
be
whether
or
not
with
respect
to
a
federally
created
right
there
is
any
bar
that
you
can
find
that
the
legislature
has
affirmatively
imposed.
ms.
marilyn
holle
well,
in
california
the
structure
is
a
little
different.
ms.
marilyn
holle
yes.
ms.
marilyn
holle
yes.
ms.
marilyn
holle
no,
the
court
below
dealt
with
federal
law
questions,
and
indeed
we
don't
think
you
reach
state
law
questions
unless
you
rule
against
us
on
the
federal
law,
and
therefore
have
to
look
at
that
as
an
alternative
reason.
ms.
marilyn
holle
i
think
maybe
you
follow
what
you
did
in
rogers
v.
mills.
send
it
back
for
certification.
but
i
don't
think
because
of
the
nature
of
the
statute
involved
here
you
need
to
do
that.
maybe...
i
would
like
to
go
to--
ms.
marilyn
holle
--waiver
was
argued
under
the
parden
standard,
and
if
you
look
at
parden,
this
court
relied
on
the
reasoning
of
a
california
state
court.
ms.
marilyn
holle
no,
but
this
court
relied
on
the
reasoning
in
parden
versus
california
for
its
outcome.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
mr.
ryan's
contention
that
before
a
state
may
be
brought
to
federal
court
by
a
citizen
to
vindicate
a
federally
created
right,
the
statute
creating
that
federal
civil
right
must
contain
magic
words
under
the
state
proposed
express
language
rule.
we
contend
that
that
is
an
extreme
rule,
and
it
confers
on
the
eleventh
amendment
protections
given
to
no
other
rule.
such
a
rule
would
direct
this
court...
would
direct
courts
to
reach
results
which
would
be
contrary
to
the
will
and
intent
of
congress,
reach
results
which
would
frustrate
the
very
purposes
for
which
a
statute
was
enacted,
would
direct
this...
would
direct
courts
to
ignore
legislative
history.
and
the
reason
we
are
in
this
situation
is
really
the
failed
logic
of
hans.
first
you
have
hans.
then
to
limit
hans
you
have
the
notion,
the
fiction
developed
in
ex
parte
young.
then
you
need
more,
so
abrogation,
waiver,
and
consent
doctrines
are
developed.
indeed,
with
the
complexity
of
these
doctrines,
you
have
a
situation
which
is
confusing,
byzantine
in
structure,
and
one
in
which
actually
this
court
would
give
license
to
a
state
who
is
in
federal
court
on
a
federal
cause
of
action
to
lay
back
until
a
merits
decision
was
reached,
and
then
to
leap
out
and
shout
sovereign
immunity
to
avoid
the
result.
in
response
to
this,
the
state
and
indeed
the
united
states
is
proposing
the
clear
statement
rule,
but
that
rule,
as
senator
cranston
and
the
other
congresspeople
have
indicated,
really,
i
think,
raises
separation
of
powers
problems.
by
issuing
a
prescriptive
rule,
this
court,
i
believe,
would
trench
on
the
article
i
rights
of
the
coordinate
branch.
what
we
really
ask
is
that
this
court
give
effect
to
congress's
intent
and
not
require
congress
to
jump
through
several
hoops
before
this
court
believes
congress
meant
what
it
said.
a
point
raised
by
both
mr.
ryan
and
in
the
united
states'
brief
is
the
need
for
magic
words
relating
to
damages.
i
think
that
this
court's
review
of
damages,
that
is,
appropriate
remedy
for
at
least
intentional
employment
discrimination
was
covered
in
conrail
and
is
applicable
here.
i
think
to
find
that
congress
intended
to
withhold
from
a
federal
court
a
remedy
so
conditional
as
back
pay,
traditionally
included
within
equitable
remedies,
would
be
anomalous.
indeed,
this
congress
when
it
enhanced
and
extended
504
in
1978,
had
before
it
cases
which
had
awarded
damages,
southeastern
community
college,
you
know,
duran
versus
city
of
tampa,
drennon,
and
the
damage
issued
was
raised
also
in
the
court
below
in
southeastern
community
college
versus
davis.
the
state
also
says,
well,
what
are
you
really
arguing
about?
you
can
go
to
state
court.
isn't
that
enough?
under
the
facts
in
our
case,
it
really
wasn't
enough.
first,
we
are
dealing
with
a
federal
civil
right,
and
we
wanted
to
go
where
you
traditionally
go
to
vindicate
a
federal
civil
right.
we
also
went
to
federal
court
because
of
what
we
perceive
as
the
exigencies
in
our
own
case.
we
believed
that
coming
to
federal
court
after
attempting
to
resolve
this
problem
through
complaints
with
hew,
we
would
have
a
good
chance
at
a
remedy
within
a
year.
when
you
look
at
the
facts
as
set
out
in
the
complaint,
this
is
somebody
who
worked
for
free
for
atascadero
state
hospital
as
a
student
volunteer.
a
paid
nine-month,
half-time
student
assistanceship
program
came
open.
because
he
had
been
doing
a
good
job,
he
was
offered
that
job.
but
because
that
then
involved
the
personnel
bureaucracy,
he
was
knocked
out.
the
consequences
was
not
just
him
not
getting
that
money.
the
consequences
was
that
he
didn't
get
his
bachelor's
degree,
because
he
needed
that
internship
to
complete
six
clinical
field
requirements
for
his
degree
in
recreation
assistance.
but
beyond
the
facts
in
our
individual
case,
there
is
a
logical
inconsistency
in
the
position
urged
by
mr.
ryan.
california
does
provide
a
remedy
for
504
claims,
but
it
is
a
remedy
provided
at
the
whim
of
the
state,
at
the
grace
of
the
state.
the
state
tomorrow
could
close
its
doors
to
504
victims.
and
this
court
has
dealt
with
state
constitutions
which
enshrine
late
nineteenth
century
notions
of
sovereign
immunity.
do
people
in,
say,
alabama,
whose
constitution
this
court
considered
in
parden
and
again
in
alabama
v.
pugh,
have
no
remedy?
did
congress
intend
that
there
be
different
results
depending
on
the
particular
state
the
person
found
himself
or
her
to
be
in?
or
is
the
state
really
arguing
a
more
extreme
position,
that
when
congress
enacted
504,
it
abrogated
state
sovereign
immunity
in
their
own
courts,
and
indeed
perhaps
compelled
state
courts
to
keep
their
doors
open
for
victims
of
504
discrimination
at
the
hands
of
the
state.
i
would
submit
that
the
position
we
put
forward
is
certainly
the
more
reasonable
one,
namely,
that
congress
intended
a
federal
court
remedy
against
any
and
all
recipients
as
well
as
a
state
court
remedy
where
the
state
permitted
it.
i
might...
sort
of
missed
that
when
i
was
contrasting
why
we
wanted
to
go
to
federal
court,
is
that
at
the
time,
then,
and
now,
it
takes
four
years
to
get
to
trial
in
state
court,
and
we
felt
we
could
resolve
our
problem
in
a
year
in
federal
court.
one
point
that
mr.
ryan
made
was
that
states
are
not
named
under
the
civil
rights
act.
we
contend
they
are
named,
and
that
they
are
the
largest
component
probably
of
the
class
defined
as
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance.
it
is
an
unambiguous
definition,
a
definition
that
was
borrowed
and
established
from
that
from
title
6
by
504's
mother
and
perhaps
from
504's
twin,
title
9.
in
looking
at
the
enactment
of
504,
you
have
to
remember
that
504
was
not
enacted
in
a
vacuum.
it
was
enacted
against
a
backdrop
of
1982
title
6
and
indeed
title
9.
what
congress
was
doing
was
borrowing
a
model
that
worked.
it
was
not
amending
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
is
a
statute
replete
with
minutiae.
it
was
not
amending
the
social
security
act,
again
a
problem
of
a
statute
which
under
each
title
has
just
an
incredible
amount
of
detail
and
minutiea.
it
was
creating
a
right,
a
statute
like
that
of
title
6,
like
that
of
title
9,
a
statute,
a
federal
civil
right
which
would
not
be
frozen
in
time,
but
which
would
be
a
illuminated
and
informed
by
history,
experience,
and
developing
case
law,
as
is
the
case
under
1982
vis-a-vis
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park,
as
was
the
case
under
title
7
in
griggs
versus
duke
power.
we
are
talking
about
a
very
different
animal.
the
purpose
really
is
to
look
at
what
congress
intended,
and
the
background
of
what
congress
intended
is
informed
by
the
legal
standards
when
504
was
drafted
in
1972.
the
standard
there
was
parden,
and
under
parden
we
meet
the
test.
the
parden
test
is
met
because
the
states
are
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
class
covered.
the
parden
standard
is
met
because
the
state
in
accepting
federal
financial
assistance
made
itself
subject
to
504,
including
the
liability
to
suit.
remember,
parden
was
the
first
case
in
this
court
dealing
with
whether
or
not
a
citizen
could
go
to
federal
court
to
vindicate
a
federally
created
right
under
federal
law.
the
murray
rule
was
a
rule
articulated
to
preserve
and
protect
legitimate
state
sovereign
immunity
interests,
legitimate
interests
in
defining
when
and
where
suits
against
it
could
be
brought
which
were
state-created
rights.
the
1974
congress
which
clarified
and
expanded
the
definition
of
the
protected
class
underscored
the
intention
that
all
recipients
were
to
be
subject
to
suit.
in
1978,
cranston,
in
the
legislative
history
involving
states,
cranston
indicated
that
attorney
fees
were
to
be
awarded
whether
the
states
were
named
or
whether
states'
officials
were
named,
again
an
indication
that
congress
knew
states
were
being
sued.
indeed,
i
think
some
of
the
legislative
history
involving
statements
by
bayh
lists
state
suits,
such
as
campmire.
indeed,
the
state
was
sued
in...
it
was
a
state
instrumentality
in
southeastern
community
college
v.
davis,
in
which,
in
fact,
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
was
flagged
at
the
court
of
appeal
level
so
did
not
come
ignored
to
this
court.
on
the
second
ground,
i
think
i
have
pretty
well
covered
it,
except
i
really
want
to
note
here
that
the
position
of
the
state
is
one
representing
the
interests
of
part
of
the
state,
that
is,
a
particular
department
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
state.
the
position
of
the
state
here
is
really
analogous
to
the
position
of
the
state
in
brown
v.
pitchess,
where
the
state
attorney
general
argued
to
our
state
supreme
court
that
state
courts
should
be
closed
to
1983
claims,
which
our
state
supreme
court
rejected
unanimously,
and
analogous
also
to
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
in
williams
v.
horvath,
where
the
attorney
general
argued
that
state
government
tort
immunity
conditions
precedent
to
suit
should
be
engrafted
on
1983.
that
also
was
rejected
unanimously.
on
waiver,
i
ask
you
to
read
the
state
decision
of
maurice
v.
california,
the
very
same
case
whose
reasoning
this
court
relied
on
in
parden.
i
think
you
will
agree
with
the
conclusions
reached
by
mr.
scanlon's
attorneys.
on
the
final
issue,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
logic
of
hans,
if
not
the
result
of
hans,
should
be
overruled,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
list
of
authorities
appended
to
our
brief,
which
really
calls
into
question
the
presumptions
of
the
hans
court,
and
i
do
so
without
necessarily
challenging
the
result
of
hans.
principles
of
comity
indeed,
principles
articulated
in
professor
fields'
article
noted
in
the
brief
of
the
aclu
provide
the
means
by
which
the
legitimate
state
interests
through
comity,
et
cetera,
can
be
protected,
while
recognizing
that
there
were
two
amendments
proffered
to
congress
following
chisolm,
one,
the
one
that
won,
which
limited
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
citizen
diversity
clause,
you
know,
where
the
defendant
was
a
state,
and
one
which
would
do,
which
would
have
the
result
that
this
court
indicated
in
hans
was
the
result
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
broader
amendment
lost
and
i
think
should
be...
i
should
think
that
the
logic
of
hans
should
be
relooked
at
again
by
this
court.
ms.
marilyn
holle
yes.
ms.
marilyn
holle
but
that
case
was
approved
specifically
in
the
first...
the
state
court
in
nevada
v.
hall
decision,
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
call
it
to
your
attention.
ms.
marilyn
holle
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
first
nevada
v.
hall
decision.
in
conclusion,
504
was
a
fairly
won
political
victory.
it
gave
important
rights
to
handicapped
persons
to
enable
them
to
participate
and
contribute
in
the
mainstream
of
society.
504
gave
handicapped
persons
the
right
to
enforce
its
promise
in
federal
court
against
all
recipients,
including
the
state.
we
ask
that
this
court
do
no
more
than
give
effect
to
what
congress
intended
when
congress
extended
to
disabled
persons
the
rights
previously
given
to
other
disenfranchised
groups.
thank
you.
