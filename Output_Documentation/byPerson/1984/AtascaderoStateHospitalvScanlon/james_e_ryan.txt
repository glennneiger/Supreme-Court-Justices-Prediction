mr.
james
e.
ryan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
comes
here
on
a
petition
by
state
defendants
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
is
our
position
that
that
court
was
in
error
when
it
held
that
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
as
embodied
in
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
did
not
constitute
a
bar
to
the
federal
court
civil
action
that
was
commenced
by
respondent
in
this
case.
central
to
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
were
its
findings
on
two
points,
first,
that
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
constituted
an
effective
abrogation
of
state's
immunity
under
that
act,
and
secondly,
that
by
the
receipt
of
federal
funds
these
state
defendants
impliedly
consented
to
that
claimed
abrogation.
we
submit
that
had
the
court
below
applied
the
settled
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
under
the
precedence
of
this
court
it
could
not
have
reached
the
conclusions
that
it
did.
we
ask
nothing
more
in
this
case
than
that
those
settled
principles
and
precedents
be
applied
today.
the
guarantee
of
sovereign
immunity,
simply
stated,
is
this,
that
no
state
may
be
sued
in
federal
court
without
consent
given.
in
the
final
analysis,
when
one
reviews
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
eleventh
amendment
area,
it
is
the
search
for
consent
that
marks
the
court's
decisions.
as
with
any
guarantee
or
privilege
under
the
constitution,
this
court
has
stated
repeatedly
that
a
waiver
will
not
be
found
absent
the
clearest
of
circumstances.
in
the
context
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
it
has
been
the
rule
since
at
least
1908
in
the
murray
versus
wilson
distilling
company
case
that
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
will
not
be
found
absent
express
language
or
overwhelming
implication
from
the
text
as
will
leave
no
reasonable
construction
otherwise.
this
clear
statement
or
clear
language
rule,
bred
no
controversy,
nor
even
invited
the
attention
of
this
court
until
there
began
to
emerge
the
concept
that
in
lieu
of
express
words,
a
waiver
or
consent
could
be
found
on
the
basis
of
state
conduct.
recognition
of
this
doctrine
was
first
articulated
in
the
hardin
case.
but
a
recognition
of
consent
by
conduct
did
not
dispense
with
the
requirement
that
express
language
be
present.
rather,
the
implied
waiver
doctrine
simply
represented
a
shift
as
to
where
that
express
language
must
be
found.
thus
in
the
implied
waiver
case
of
employees
versus
missouri
department
of
health,
this
court
stated
that
the
express
language
found
in
that
case
must
show
that
congress
had
considered
and
explicitly
determined
to
sweep
away
the
immunity
of
the
states
from
suit
in
federal
court.
that
is
not
to
suggest,
though,
that
the
concept
or
the
requirement
of
express
language
found
its
genesis
in
the
employees
case.
as
i
have
mentioned,
as
to
any
constitutional
waiver
or
privilege,
as
to
any
constitutional
guarantee
or
privilege,
it
has
always
been
the
rule
that
express
language
must
be
found.
the
only
distinction
to
be
made
at
this
point
is
that
in
express
waiver
cases,
this
court
will
look
to
the
express
language
on
the
state
side
and
in
implied
waiver
cases
this
court
will
look
for
the
express
language
on
the
congressional
side.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
in
federal
court,
your
honor?
no.
i
think
it
is
clear
under--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--if
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
had
sued
an
official,
that
issue
would
have
been
raised.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
no
officials
were
named
in
this
case,
but
as
to
naming
a
state
agency
itself--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--under
the
common
understanding
of
the
rules
pertaining
to
ex
parte
young
at
that
time.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
yes,
your
honor.
whether
we
are
dealing
with
an
express
waiver
case,
therefore,
or
an
implied
waiver,
it
has
always
been
the
rule
that
the
court
look
to
and
require
express
language.
it
is
therefore
not
accurate
for
amici
to
suggest
in
this
case
that
the
application
of
a
clear
statement
rule
represents
some
form
of
impermissible
retroactive
application
of
a
statutory
construction
principle.
this
clear
statement
requirement
also
obtains
even
where
congress
is
exercising
its
plenary
powers
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
while
consent
to
abrogation
under
those
circumstances
is
presumed
by
virtue
of
the
state's
ratification
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
nonetheless
this
court
has
still
required
that
the
language
which
is
to
be
deemed
sufficient
for
abrogation
be
explicit.
thus
we
find
in
the
fitzpatrick
case
which
was
involving
a
fourteenth
amendment
enactment,
title
7,
this
court
found
that
the
requisite
clear
expression
of
an
intent
to
sweep
away
the
immunity
of
the
states
was
present
in
the
title
7
statutes.
consequently,
whether
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
fourteenth
amendment
exercise
or
a
spending
clause
exercise,
we
still
will
have
to
find
the
explicit
language
in
the
statute
under
the
rehabilitation
act.
applying
this
clear
statement
rule
to
the
statutory
language
at
issue
here
under
the
rehabilitation
act,
we
submit
that
it
is
manifest
that
congress
has
not
evidenced
in
any
clear
language
any
expression
that
it
has
considered
and
firmly
decided
to
sweep
away
the
immunity
of
the
states.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
congress
had
authorized
suit
against
a
general
class
of
defendants
which
literally
included
states.
to
start
with,
we
feel
it
is
clear
that
there
is
no
inclusion
of
the
states
under
the
act
expressly.
the
plain
reading
of
the
statutory
language
in
this
case
demonstrates
that
congress
has
made
no
expression
on
the
requisite
intent
that
this
court
has
required.
when
it
came
to
expressing
that
states
would
be
included
as
recipients
under
the
act,
congress
left
that
to
the
executive
branch,
which
did
so
by
regulation.
when
it
came
to
expressing
that
private
actions
were
authorized
under
the
rehabilitation
act,
congress
did
not
express
that.
it
left
that
declaration
to
the
judicial
branch.
certainly
if
congress
has
not
provided
for
an
express
remedy
under
the
act,
it
cannot
be
claimed
that
it
has
swept
away
state's
immunity
to
federal
suits
under
the
very
same
language.
two
or
three
circuits
have
reached
this
conclusion.
and
the
federal
government
has
concurred
in
its
amicus
brief
filed
in
this
case.
respondent,
however,
urges
that
the
enactment
involved
here
was
a
fourteenth
amendment
exercise,
and
as
such
we
must
look
beyond
the
statutory
language
employed
by
congress
and
pursue
a
search
through
the
relevant
legislative
histories
and
materials,
legislative
history
and
materials
not
just
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
but
of
title
6,
upon
which
portions
of
the
rehabilitation
act
are
modeled.
while
we
do
not
agree
that
this
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
enactment,
nor
do
we
agree
that
even
if
it
were,
a
search
beyond
the
statutory
language
is
allowed
in
view
of
this
court's
precedents.
in
any
event,
it
is
to
avail
to
the
respondent
in
this
case
by
conducting
such
an
examination
of
the
record.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
it
has
not.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
he
certainly
was.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
very
definitely.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
the
state
has
generally
waived
its
immunity
for
suit
in
states
under
this
type
statute,
but
not...
that
is
not
to
say,
of
course,
that
the
state
has
waived
its
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment
for
suits
in
federal
court.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
our
position
is
that
under
established
law
as
handed
down
by
this
court,
that
waivers
under
state
law
pertaining
to
suits
brought
in
state
courts
do
not
constitute
waiver
of
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
yes,
you
have...
yes,
this
court
has,
your
honor,
in
several
cases.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
where
similar
statutes--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--well,
the
position
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
is
not
that
there
has
been
a
broad
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
only
that
there
has
been
a
waiver
in
state
courts,
and
this
court
has
seen
this
very
same
argument
made
in
a
number
of
cases
right
through
pennhurst
ii.
in
fact,
the
statute
that
was
raised
in
pennhurst
ii
and
reviewed
by
this
court
was
almost
identical
to
the
constitutional
provision
which
respondent
relies
on
in
this
case,
and
in
pennhurst
ii
and
in
patsy
and
employees,
this
court
rejected
the
same
argument
on
each
occasion.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
that's
correct.
it
does
not
include
actions
in
federal
court.
and,
i
might
add,
it
has
never
been
so
held,
and
in
fact,
in
the
only
case
which
i
am
aware
of
that
has
reviewed
that
constitutional
provision,
it
is
a
district
court
case,
but
it
did
uphold
the
very
argument
that
i
am
making
today.
in
any
event,
when
respondent
has
conducted
his
presumably
thorough
review
of
the
legislative
histories
and
materials
underlying
both
this
act
and
title
6,
we
find
that
only
two
intents
may
be
gleaned
from
that
review:
first,
that
it
was
the
intent
or
understanding
of
congress
that
states
would
be
generally
covered
by
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973;
and
second,
that
congress
anticipated
or
expected
that
some
form
of
redress
would
be
available
to
persons
who
were
victims
of
violations
of
section
504,
whether
that
form
of
enforcement
would
be
through
administrative
remedy
or
private
action.
neither
of
these
understandings
on
congress's
part,
however,
serves
to
answer
the
essential
inquiry,
and
the
very
reason
why
respondent
embarked
on
his
review
of
the
legislative
history,
neither
of
these
understandings
show
an
intent
by
congress
or
an
expression
by
congress
that
it
had
considered
and
firmly
decided
to
sweep
away
the
immunity
of
the
states,
notwithstanding
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
have
seen
more
than
one
statement
of
this
clear
statement
rule,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
the
test
which
must
be
applied
in
this
case.
for
instance,
in
the
employees
case,
the
clear
statement
rule
was
framed
in
these
terms:
"congress
must
by
clear
language
express
its
intent
to
bring
states
to
heel
in
the
sense
of
lifting
their
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court.
"
in
quern,
it
was
stated
by
this
court
that
"congress
must
by
clear
language
indicate
on
its
face
an
intent
to
sweep
away
the
immunity
of
the
states.
"
and
most
recently
in
pennhurst
ii
this
court
restated
the
rule
and
embraced
it
in
the
following
terms:
"congress
must
by
unequivocal
expression
of
intent
express
that
intent
to
overturn
the
constitutional
immunity
of
the
several
states.
"
we
submit
that
the
very
lengths
to
which
respondent
has
gone
to
supply
this
court
with
the
requisite
clear
language
expression
by
congress
and
the
very
fact
this
case
is
here
bespeaks
the
lack
of
clarity
with
respect
to
congress's
intent
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity
under
this
act.
if
congress
intends
that
violations
of
section
504
be
redressed
against
states
in
federal
court
suits,
it
knows
how
to
correct
that
problem.
it
can
correct
that
problem.
we
have
given
examples
in
our
opening
brief
to
which
respondent
has
not
replied
of
instances
where
congress
has
clearly
expressed
its
intent
that
it
was
sweeping
away
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states.
title
7
is
just
one
example
of
how
that
kind
of
abrogation
can
be
done
and
will
satisfy
the
precedents
of
this
court.
respondent
and
amici,
however,
have
suggested
that
this
clear
language
or
clear
statement
rule
be
abolished.
such
a
suggestion
ignores
the
strong
policy
and
practical
considerations
underlying
such
a
rule.
first
off,
the
clear
language
or
clear
statement
rule
provides
notice,
notice
to
all
involved,
notice
to
the
states
that
the
sovereign
immunity
is
being
attempted
to
be
abrogated,
notice
to
the
beneficiaries,
if
there
be
any,
of
an
act
as
to
what
their
available
remedies
are,
and
not
least
importantly,
notice
to
this
court
that
an
abrogation
has
in
fact
been
attempted.
the
alternative
for
not
having
a
clear
statement
rule
leaves
this
court
in
the
position
of
having
to
deduce
from
inference
as
to
what
congress's
intent
was
with
respect
to
state
sovereign
immunity.
this
is
a
role
which
amici
have
suggested
this
court
should
not
perform.
at
the
same
time,
the
lack
of
a
clear
statement
rule
requires
by
nature
that
states
become
surveyors
of
the
congressional
record
and
scattered
bits
of
legislative
history
both
under
the
subject
act
and
of
any
other
act
that
that
statute
may
incorporate.
in
order
to
determine
in
the
first
instance,
before
the
conduct
which
is
going
to
attach
to
that
abrogation,
whether
in
fact
there
is
a
condition
of
abrogation
at
all,
we
submit
that
a
clear
statement
rule
makes
good
sense
and
should
be
maintained
in
this
case.
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
respondent
has
suggested
that
the
state
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
under
state
law
and
therefore
its
sovereign
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
have
addressed
those
items
in
our
reply
brief,
but
i
would
only
add
that
identical
arguments
have
been
made
before
this
court
on
several
occasions,
in
the
murray
case,
in
the
petty
case,
in
the
florida
department
of
health
case,
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
in
the
pennhurst
ii
case.
in
each
of
those
instances,
a
similar
argument
was
rejected.
in
conclusion,
the
recent
pennhurst
decision
emphasized
the
importance
of
adhearing
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
as
exemplified
by
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
to
the
requirement
of
unequivocal
expression
of
congressional
intent
before
this
court
would
declare
that
sovereign
immunity
had
been
abrogated.
in
this
case
and
under
this
act,
whether
you
look
to
the
statutory
history,
statutory
language,
or
the
legislative
history
behind
that
act,
one
finds
no
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
sweep
away
the
state's
immunity
under
this
act.
consequently,
we
would
request
respectfully
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
be
reversed.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
a
few
points,
if
i
may.
respondent's
arguments
with
respect
to
california's
waiver
of
immunity
to
be
sued
in
its
own
courts
would
turn
the
rule
that
this
court
has
enunciated
in
so
many
occasions
when
the
same
arguments
were
made
literally
on
its
head.
respondent
would
have
the
legislature
state
explicitly
that
it
was
reserving
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
order
for
the
state
to
continue
to
maintain
its
federal
court
immunity.
this
is
not
the
rule
that
was
expressed
in
the
pennhurst
ii
case
under
a
similar
statute
wherein
the
court
stated
that
only
where
there
is
a
clear
declaration
of
the
state's
intent
to
submit
its
fiscal
problems
to
other
courts
will
a
waiver
be
deemed
by
virtue
of
a
state
statute
or
other
provision.
a
state's
waiver
of
immunity
in
its
own
courts
has
never
been
held
to
be
sufficient
to
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
of
course
would
go
completely
contrary
to
the
express
waiver
requirements.
respondent
mentioned
that
the
rule
that
should
be
applied
was
that
which
guided
the
court
in
the
parden
case,
but
as
this
court
itself
noted
subsequent
to
the
parden
case,
that
case
stands
as
unique
and
on
the
outer
limits
of
implied
waiver
cases.
and
in
fact
under
almost
virtually
the
same
facts
this
court
in
the
employees
versus
missouri
case
came
to
just
the
contrary
conclusion,
wherein
it
was
not
locked
into
prior
precedents
in
which
it
had
held
that
states
were
included
within
all-inclusive
language
employed
by
congress
in
the
context
of
railroad
legislation.
finally,
respondent
in
answer
to
a
question
made
note
of
the
fact
that
it
takes
four
years
to
get
to
trial
in
the
california
state
courts.
while
that
may
be
the
case
under
some
circumstances,
i
am
not
sure.
it
only
takes
20
days
plus
five
days
for
mailing
to
obtain
a
