justice
rehnquist
ms.
holle,
have
you
said
all
you
are
going
to
say
about
your
argument
that
the
state
statute
waives
immunity
both
in
federal
courts
as
well
as
state
courts?
justice
rehnquist
you
are
going
to
get
to
that
later?
justice
rehnquist
have
you
read
our
great
northern
insurance
company
versus
read
case?
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
think
it
depends
on,
ms.
holle,
the
intent
of
the
legislature
passing
the--
justice
rehnquist
--i
mean,
i
was
asking
what
you
think
it
depends
on.
justice
rehnquist
so
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
they
intended
the
waiver
to
extend
to
federal
court
as
well
as
to
state
court?
justice
rehnquist
but
what
is
the
test
for
purposes
of
applying
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
rehnquist
so
if
a
legislature
simply
passes
a
statute,
perhaps
like
the
statute
in
great
northern,
saying
the
state
waives
its
immunity
to
sue,
period,
that
would
be
enough
in
your--
justice
rehnquist
--but
i--
justice
rehnquist
--would
you
answer
my
question?
