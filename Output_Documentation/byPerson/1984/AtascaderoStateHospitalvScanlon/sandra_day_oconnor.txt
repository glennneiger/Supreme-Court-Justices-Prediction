justice
o'connor
mr.
ryan,
i
suppose
you
would
concede,
however,
that
a
plaintiff
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
could
nevertheless
seek
an
injunction
against
the
state
asking
for
an
order
that
the
physician
be
given--
justice
o'connor
--you
think
not
under
ex
parte
young?
justice
o'connor
but
no
officials
were
named
here.
justice
o'connor
if
officials
had
been
named,
and
injunctive
relief
sought,
you
would
agree
the
suit
could
have
proceeded
in
federal
court?
justice
o'connor
and
maybe
attorneys'
fees
obtained
if
successful?
justice
o'connor
now,
did
the
court
below
deal
with
that
question?
justice
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
federal
law
issue.
what
do
we
do
with
this
state
law
waiver
question?
