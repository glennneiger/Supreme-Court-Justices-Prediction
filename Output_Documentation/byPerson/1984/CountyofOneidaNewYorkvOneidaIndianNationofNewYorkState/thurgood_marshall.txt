justice
marshall
is
that
the
reason
you
filed
an
action
for
damages
rather
than
the
judgment,
to
get
away
from
laches?
justice
marshall
and
you
didn't
want
laches.
justice
marshall
you
didn't
want
to
have
to
face
up
to
laches.
justice
marshall
well,
is
it
also
true
that
he
can't
take
the
rights
of
the
trustee,
he
can't
exert
those,
can
he?
justice
marshall
isn't
that
what
you
are
doing
here?
justice
marshall
what
right
does
the
tribe
have
to
ignore
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
marshall
but
the
u.s.
could
do
it.
justice
marshall
so
by
coming
in
here
and
making
this
argument,
you
are
going
to
give
them
that
right.
justice
marshall
how
can
you
do
that?
