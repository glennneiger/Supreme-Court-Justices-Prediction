justice
o'connor
mr.
van
gestel,
what
bearing,
if
any,
does
section
2415
of
title
28
of
the
u.s.
code
have
on
this
claim
asserted
by
the
indian
tribes?
justice
o'connor
well,
under
the
1982
amendments,
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
under
this
federal
statute
of
limitations,
notifies
the
indians
of...
the
indian
tribes
of
the
claims
it
intends
to
allow
and
extends
the
statute
another
year,
presumably
to
let
indian
tribes
file
their
own
claims.
it's
another
section.
so
isn't
there
some
effect
here?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
case
of
ewert
v.
bluejacket
indicates
that
state
statute
of
limitations
don't
apply
to
indian
claims?
justice
o'connor
do
you
rely
on
any
particular
case,
ms.
locklear,
for
establishing
the
federal
common
law
right
of
action
that
you
assert?
justice
o'connor
but
we
really
don't
have
a
case
involving
a
suit
by
an
indian
tribe,
i
suppose,
on
this
cause
of
action.
justice
o'connor
do
you
agree
with
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general
that
even
if
you
were
right
on
the
statute
of
limitations
question,
that
it
doesn't
apply,
that
laches
would
be
applicable
here
to
the
action
for
damages
for
trespass,
or
that
the
courts
would
have
other
equitable
powers
to
reduce
the
damages
relief?
justice
o'connor
can
the
court
do
that
if
it
is
an
action
at
law?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
relevance
of
those
statutes
relating
to
2415
and
the
1982
amendments
to
the
1970
lawsuit
brought
before
they
were
enacted?
