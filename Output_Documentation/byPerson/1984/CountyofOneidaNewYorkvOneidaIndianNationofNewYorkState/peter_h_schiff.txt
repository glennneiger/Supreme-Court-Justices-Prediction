mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
as
indicated,
we
of
course
do
fully
support
the
arguments
of
the
counties
that
the
court
below
erred
in
holding
the
counties
liable
to
the
indians
on
the
basis
of
the
alleged
violation
of
the
1793
trade
and
intercourse
act.
so
in
that
sense
we
would
certainly
hope
that
the
court
never
reaches
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
which
i
am
about
to
make
because
it
will
be
totally
unnecessary
if
you
hold
for
us
on
the
first
argument.
but
we
do
believe
that
the
courts
below
also
erred
in
holding
the
states
liable
for
indemnification
in
this
federal
proceeding.
the
state
has
not
waived
its
immunity
except
in
a
very
limited
sense.
there
is
a
provision,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
for
recovery
when
there
is
a
failure
of
title
of
land
from
the
state,
but
the
recovery
there
is
only
for
the
purchase
or
acquisition
price,
and
without
interest,
so
that...
and
that
recovery
would
be
in
the
court
of
claims
in
new
york.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
other
recovery,
but
if
there
were,
that
would
have
to
be
determined
in
the
new
york
courts.
and
of
course,
the
law
is
clear
that
even
if
there
were
any
waiver
for
suits
within
a
state
court,
that
would
not
permit
suits
in
the
federal
court.
the
court
below
seems
to
have
decided
against
the
state
on
the
indemnification
ground
for
what
appear
to
be
two
separate
bases.
one,
they
made
a
finding
that
there
was
ancillary
jurisdiction
because
the
claims
of
the
counties
against
the
state
allegedly
rose
out
of
he
same
core
of
facts
as
the
indians'
claim
against
the
counties.
and
secondly,
the
court
found
that
the
state,
by
making
the
purchases
from
the
indians
under
the
treaty
in
1795,
had
allegedly
waived
its
immunity.
the
counties
in
their
brief
indicated
that
they
took
the
view
that
these
two
positions
were
interdependent.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
counties
conceded
that
unless
there
was
a
finding
of
waiver
within
the
meaning
of
the
various
eleventh
amendment
cases,
that
they
could
not
prevail.
i
think
that
the
decision
below
may
have
gone
even
further
and
may
have...
and
seems
to
have
read
ancillary
jurisdiction
as
not
necessarily
depending
on
there
being
an
eleventh
amendment
waiver
of
immunity.
we
think
that
on
that
latter
point,
this
court's
decision
in
the
pennhurst
case
last
term
pretty
well
decided,
i
think,
that
for
the
purpose
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
just
like
appendant
jurisdiction,
that
there
has
to
be
a
separate
basis
for
jurisdiction,
and
that
where
there
is
a
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
by
the
state,
ancillary
jurisdiction
would
not
attach.
so
i
will
not
dwell
on
that
but
will
turn
on
the
question
of
whether
under
this
court's
precedents
there
was
a
waiver
of
immunity
with
respect
to
the
counties.
in
that
sense,
i
think
it
is
important,
and
there
may
not
be
any
difference.
we
do
not
believe
that
there
has
been
any
waiver
or
there
would
be
any
waiver
even
with
respect
to
the
relationship
with
the
indians,
but
that
issue
does
not
necessarily
come
into
play
here
because
there
is
no
suit
against
the
state
by
the
indians.
but
looking
at
that
overall
question,
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
edelman
v.
jordan
is
really
quite
dispositive.
as
we
understand
that
case,
there
would
be
no
waiver
unless
in
the
very
first
instance
the
suit
under
which
waiver
is
being
sought
provides
for
a...
suits
that
in
terms
includes
actions
against
a
state.
now,
whatever
can
be
said
about
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
statute
which
in
terms
provides
for
suits
against
anyone,
let
alone
the
state,
and
the
argument
is
going
to
be
made,
of
course,
that
there
is
either
an
implied
common
law
right
of
action
or
that
it
is
implied
under
the
trade
and
intercourse
act,
with
which
we
don't
agree.
but
there
is
no
argument
that
there
is
any
statutory
provision
for
a
suit
against
anyone.
and
the
county
does
argue
that
that
should
make
no
difference
if
the
court
implies
a
cause
of
action
against
it
or
against
them,
then
in
turn
the
court
should
imply
that
there
is
a,
in
terms
of
the
possibility
of
a
suit
against
the
state.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
would
undermine
what
appears
to
be
the
logic
behind
the
edelman
test
which,
taking
into
account
that
congress
does
not
lightly
impute
waivers
to
the
state,
or
even
the
possibility
that
the
state
might
waive
its
sovereign
immunity,
where
there
is
no
specific
provision
in
terms
for
suits
that
might
include
the
state,
the
state,
by
acting
under
a
statute,
would
have
no
idea
that
it
might
be
liable
for
suit
because
no
one
else
was
specifically
liable
for
suit.
so
that
in
this
case
the
absence
of
any
express
provision
for
suit
makes
the
test
in
edelman
totally
inapplicable,
and
the
state
could
not
have
waived
its
immunity.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
i
stand
corrected,
the
test
in
edelman
is
applicable,
but
it
doesn't
help
the
counties.
i
should
say
the
counties
do
not
meet
the
threshold
test
in
edelman
that
there
was
a
suit...
statute
that
literally
provided
for
a
suit
against
the
state.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
oh,
i
think
so
because
if
you
don't
show
that--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--if--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
if
you
don't
meet
that
threshold
test,
as
i
understand
it,
it
simply
isn't
any...
waiver
could
not
have
taken
place.
there
is
an
additional
argument
made
that,
well,
that
test
shouldn't
apply
in
this
case
because
what
happened
here
happened
in
1795,
and
that
the
trade
and
intercourse
act
preceded
the
adoption
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
which
probably
became
effective
in
1795
as
well,
and
with
little
debate.
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference.
the
fact
is
that
this
court
has
explained
on
numerous
occasions
the
state's
immunity
from
suits
by
its
own
citizens.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
the
county,
does
not
actually
literally
stem
from
the
eleventh
amendment,
but
it
really
inheres
in
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
in
article
3,
which
was
recently
reiterated
in
the
pennhurst
case
as
well.
but
it
was...
that
was
first
played
out
i
think
in
hans
v.
louisiana.
if
you
will
recall,
the
eleventh
amendment
arose
because
of
the
case
of
chisholm
v.
georgia,
which
involved
a
suit
by
a
citizen
of
south
carolina
right
after
the
beginning
of
the
republic,
against
the
state
of
georgia,
and
the
citizen
of
south
carolina
relied
upon
the
provision
in
the
constitution
which
provided
for
suits
against
a
state
and
citizens
of
another
state,
and
this
court
agreed
that
that
provided
jurisdiction
against
the
contention
of
the
states,
including
particularly
georgia,
that
that
provision
of
the
constitution
was
not
intended
to
be
reciprocal
but
was
only
intended
to
provide
for
a
one
way
street
of
suits
against
a
state
by
citizens
of
another
state.
very
soon
after
that,
almost
immediately
after
the
chisholm
decision,
the
eleventh
amendment
was
passed
by
the
congress
and
ratified
by
the
states
because
the
congress
simply
didn't
agree
with
that
interpretation.
but
significantly,
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
chisholm
case
didn't
deal
at
all
with
a
suit
by
a
citizen
of
one
state
against
its
own
state,
and
i
think
that
there
was
never
any
question
but
that
sovereign
immunity
existed
at
that
time.
and
it
would
be
strange
indeed
to
think
that
the
congress
which
passed
the
eleventh
amendment
in
1793,
1795,
had
any
thought
that
in
passing
the
trade
and
intercourse
act
that
the
states
were
not
immune
from
suits
by
their
own
citizens.
so
again,
there
is
no
basis
for
finding
a
waiver
of
immunity
here.
finally,
the
other
part
of
the
waiver
argument
below
was
that
this
accusation
was
allegedly
a
proprietary
act.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
can
be,
the
acquisition
of
this
land
by
treaty
in
any
sense
properly
could
be
viewed
as
proprietary,
even
if
the
state
did
sell
it
for
more
than
it
originally
purchased
it
for,
substantially
more.
but
as
our
reply
brief
points
out,
there
was
a
substantial
amount
of
state
legislation
afterwards
which
at
least
delayed
the
payments,
and
we
don't
know
whether
the
payments
for
this
land
were
actually
ever
made.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
have...
we
contend
that
the
only
liability
could
be
under
the
real
property
act--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--which
would
not
be
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
also
argue
that--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
i
think
we
raised
a
defense
that
the
law
that
was
applied
below,
justice
white,
was
applied
incorrectly.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
we
claimed
sovereign
immunity
essentially.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
argument
in
state
is--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
as
far
as
i
read
it,
there
was
an
argument
before
judge
port,
and
we
argued
the
real
property
law.
that
is
not
a
total
bar.
the
real
property
law
would
permit
recovery
of
the
amounts
paid,
but
it
doesn't...
so
we
have
argued,
one
of
our
grounds
for
the
cert
petition,
that
the
state
law
was
totally
misapplied
below,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
really
quite
ignored
by
the
courts
below.
it
is
impossible
to
tell
from
reading
the
district
judge's
opinion
what
he
decided.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
and
the--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
threshold
jurisdictional
question,
but
that
might
be
appropriate
as
well.
we
don't
say
that
that
wouldn't
be,
but
i
don't
think
you
ever
reach
that
because
that
we
think
that
the
eleventh
and
the
sovereign
immunity
question
has
to
be
reached
first
because
whatever
remedy
there
really
is
here
should
be
in
a
state
court.
finally,
i
think
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
the
overall
claim
about
the
indians,
where
we
do
agree
with
the
counties,
that
arguments
will
be
made
here
and
have
been
made
in
the
brief
that
there
is
a...
what
difference
does
it
make?
if
the
united
states
can
bring
this
action,
why
shouldn't
the
indians
be
allowed
to
seek
recovery?
we
are
thoroughly
convinced
that
judge
meskill
was
quite
correct
below
that
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
having
a
series
of
seriatim
actions,
individual
actions,
which
is
sort
of
exemplified
by
this
case.
this
case
involves
872
acres
and
only
the
income
for
two
years,
where
the
potential
liability
goes
back
190
years,
175
years,
depending
on
how
you
look
at
it,
and
a
great
deal
of...
much
more
acreage.
this
private,
these
actions
are
picking
and
choosing.
we
think
that
the
federal
government,
which
has
the
authority
under
the
1793
act
to
take
general
action,
that
that
remedy
provided
nearly
200
years
ago
should
be
the
one
that
this
court
provides
for
this
action.
we
ask
for
a
reversal.
thank
you
very
much.
