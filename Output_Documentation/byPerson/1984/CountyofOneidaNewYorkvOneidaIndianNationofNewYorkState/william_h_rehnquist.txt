justice
rehnquist
mr.
van
gestel.
justice
rehnquist
to
get
back
for
a
moment
to
the
point
you
adverted
to
earlier,
this
is
a
case
about
ownership
and
not
about
sovereignty
as
such,
i
take
it
here.
justice
rehnquist
wouldn't
there
have
to
be
a
reservation
embracing
the
land?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
van
gestel,
this
is
not
an
argument
on
the
merits,
i
take
it
as
to
whether
if
they
could
get
into...
if
the
tribe
could
get
into
court
they
could
properly
assert
this
as
an
affirmative
claim
or
as
a
defense.
justice
rehnquist
but
is
it
the
intent
of
congress
as
to
whether
the
indians
should
have
a
right
of
action
under
this
particular
statute
or
the
intent
of
congress
as
to
how
the
merits
of
the
statute
should
he
interpreted
if
the
tribe
were
to
be
able
to
get
into
court
in
some
way?
justice
rehnquist
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
supposing
that
this
action
had
been
brought
in
the
supreme
court
of
oneida
county
or
in
the
state
court
system
and...
so
that
there
was
no
question
that
new
york
would
entertain
that
sort
of
a
cause
of
action,
your
argument
then
that
you
are
now
making
wouldn't
address
the
situation
where
the
action
were
brought
in
the
state
court,
would
it?
justice
rehnquist
such
as
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
that
is
an
important
issue
in
your
case,
but
why
would
it
be
resolved
any
differently
in
state
court
if
the
state
court
in
deciding
the
case
is
subject
to
the
overall
limitations
of
federal
law.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
there
is
an
appeal
then
taken,
perhaps
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
or
ultimately
to
this
court,
and
the
indian
tribe
or
plaintiff
says,
look,
this
nonintercourse
act
of
1791
and
the
supplemental...
or
1793,
the
supplemental
act...
say
that
this
land
shouldn't
have
been
taken
away
from
us
the
way
it
was,
that
we
shouldn't
have
been
allowed
to
deed
it
away
without
the
attendant
things
specified
in
the
statute,
and
therefore
we
are
entitled
to
possession.
and
that's
a
federal
question.
justice
rehnquist
well,
can't
new
york
give
a
right
of
action
under
that
statute
when
you
are
talking
about
a
real
property
question?
justice
rehnquist
and
doesn't
new
york
give
anyone
a
right
to
come
into
court
and
say
we
are
now
dispossessed
of
black
acre;
we
are
entitled
by
law
to
black
acre:
therefore,
give
us
black
acre.
by
federal
law.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
won't
pursue
you
further.
my
own
personal
reaction
is
that
the...
your
statute
of
limitations
and
your
arguments
on
the
merits
are
probably
going
to
get
you...
or
the
merits
of
the
effect
of
the
statute,
are
going
to
get
you
further
than
the
private
right
of
action.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
impact
to
which
you
refer,
the
broader
scope?
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
mean
that
the
test
in
edelman
is
inapplicable.
you
mean
that
it
comes
out
against
the
county.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
united
states
didn't
seek
to
obtain
that
relief,
did
it?
justice
rehnquist
so
what
is
the
point?
justice
rehnquist
one
hundred
seventy-five
years
later.
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
2415
only
applied
by
its
terms
to
an
action
brought
by
the
united
states.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
after
he
publishes,
might
be
persuaded
to
change
his
mind
by
the
indians.
perhaps
that
is
the
purpose
of
publication.
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
i
don't
think
you...
certainly
you
are
arguing
very
much
by
implication
and
not
by
what
the
statute
says
on
its
face.
justice
rehnquist
well,
legislative
history
isn't
quite
the
same
thing
as
the
statute,
statutory
language
that
congress
chose.
justice
rehnquist
but
that
assumes
that
the
cause
of
action
was
subsisting
as
of
that
time.
what
if
the
cause
of
action
had
earlier
been
barred?
justice
rehnquist
but
1362
is
just
a
grant
of
jurisdiction,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
the
fact
that
legislative
history
might
refer
to
a
case,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
the
jurisdictional
aspect,
not
the
merits,
that
would
be
of
interest
in
the
case.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
cause
of
action
once
existed,
but
that
doesn't
evidence
congress...
any
particular
congress'
view
that
the
thing
might
not
have
beer
barred
at
that
time.
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
talking
about
state
law
operating
after
congress
has
spoken.
i
think
what
justice
stevens
has
in
mind
is
that
state
law
might
have
operated
well
before
congress
spoke
in
1982,
so
i
don'
think
those
allotment
cases
are
necessarily
analogous.
justice
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
speak
to
the...
certainly
you
are
not
suggesting
that
one
can
simply
read
the
1790
act
and
infer
from
that
that
no
state
statute
of
limitation
or
any
borrowed
state
statute
of
limitation
would
apply.
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
really
think
that
the
only
fair
reading
of
the
1793
statute
is
that
it
absolutely
by
its
terms
precludes
the
application
of
statutes
of
limitations?
justice
rehnquist
well,
a
great
deal
of
your
case
seems
to
depend
on
implication
on
implication
on
implication.
justice
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
say
in
your
argument
why
you
think
the
statute
of
limitations
claim
is
limited?
justice
rehnquist
i
see
what
you
men.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
anyone
is
contending
that
after
congress
prescribed
particular
limitations,
end
up
in
1982,
that
state
statutes
apply.
i
think
it
is
to
the
period
before
congress
started
prescribing
that
these
arguments
are
address.
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
does
the
text
of
the
act
show
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
claims
by
indian
tribes?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
united
states
didn't
bring
this
suit.
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
the
same
sort
of
provision
that
justice
stevens
quoted
to
your
colleague,
nothing
in
this
proviso.
that
doesn't
say
that
congress
was
saying
it
could
not
have
happened;
it
just
wasn't
to
happen
by
virtue
of
that
proviso.
