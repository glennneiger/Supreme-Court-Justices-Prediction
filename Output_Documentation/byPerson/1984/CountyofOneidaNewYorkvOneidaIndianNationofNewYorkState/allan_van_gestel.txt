mr.
allan
van
gestel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
test
case,
having
been
so
designated
by
the
plaintiffs,
having
been
so
treated
by
the
courts
below.
as
is
in
many
cases
before
this
court,
the
decision
will
reach
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
this
case.
in
this
case
in
particular,
it
will
reach
much
beyond
the
boundaries.
the
1974
opinion
in
this
case
has
already
spawned
a
vast
number
of
indian
land
claims.
a
number
of
cases
are
pending
throughout
eastern
states
and
southern
states,
citing
the
1974
jurisdictional
opinion
as
if
it
were
an
opinion
on
the
merits
of
the
issues.
that
case,
indeed,
has
already
been
cited
162
times
since
1974.
this
case
has
some
history
in
it,
and
i
checked
to
see
how
many
opinions
were
rendered
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
between
1790
and
1795,
the
date
on
which
the
transaction
in
issue
occurred
here,
and
there
were
only
16.
what
is
involved
here
is
a
purchase
of
land
by
the
state
of
new
york
from
the
oneida
indian
nation
in
1795.
the
claim,
filed
about
175
years
later,
is
that
the
state
of
new
york
failed
to
comply
with
the
restrictions
and
limitations
contained
in
the
second
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act,
the
trade
and
intercourse
act
of
1793,
and
the
claim
is
that
as
a
result,
the
oneida
indians,
rather
than
the
counties
of
madison
and
oneida
and
the
others
who
live
in
the
claim
area,
the
100,000
acres
involved,
presently
own
that
land.
own
is
a
word
that
is
important
because
the
oneida
indians
are,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
an
institution
with
a
degree
and
element
of
sovereignty
in
it,
so
that
owning
the
land
by
the
oneida
indians
is
quite
a
bit
different
than
owning
it
by
someone
else.
the
trade
and
intercourse
acts
were
first
passed
in
1790
by
the
very
first
congress
of
the
united
states.
a
principal
question
to
be
decided
in
this
case
is
what
was
the
intent
of
that
congress
in
passing
the
first
trade
and
intercourse
acts.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
yesa,
sir.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
no,
your
honor.
what
i
meant
to
suggest
was
that
when
ownership
is
in
an
indian
tribe
as
opposed
to
an
individual
indian
or
another
individual,
you
have
to
deal
with
the
elements
of
sovereignty
that
are
inherent
in
being
an
indian
tribe.
you
cannot
avoid
it.
so
this
really
is
a
case
that
implicates
the
sovereignty
of
the
indian
nation.
if
they
own
the
land,
they
are
sovereigns
over
it
to
at
least
a
degree
as
permitted
by
the
current
law.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
no,
there
would
not
have
to
be
a
reservation.
as
i
read
the
cases
of
this
court,
simply
land
owned
by
an
indian
tribe
or
nation
is
land
that
is
subject
to
the
sovereign
rights
and
powers
of
that
indian
nation.
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
reservation
created,
let's
say,
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
i
think
then
we
do
then
turn
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
first
congress
or
the
congress
in
1793
which
passed
the
second
trade
and
intercourse
act,
intended
that
there
would
be
a
private
right
of
action
available
under
that
statute.
and
in
so
doing,
we
look
to
the
recent
work
of
this
court,
starting
principally
in
1975
with
cort
v.
ash
and
the
cases
that
have
flown
therefrom.
we
have
a
situation
here
in
which
there
is
a
statute
which
is
comprehensive.
it
deals
with
the
subject
of
regulating
and
managing
the
affairs
with
the
indian
tribes
and
nations.
it
draws
its
power,
its
basis
from
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
if
we
look
at
the
kind
of
analysis
that
this
court
has
suggested
is
appropriate
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
private
right
of
action,
it
seems
to
me
the
cases
of
this
court
in
recent
years
indicate
that
no
private
right
of
action
should
be
determined
to
exist
here.
i
would
initially
hearken
back,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
to
the
words
of
james
madison,
who
was
the
man
who
introduced
the
1793
statute.
there
he
said
at
the
time,
misunderstandings,
quarrels
and
wars
with
indians
had
originated
from
the
circumstance
of
persons
having
obtained
through
fraud
and
other
improper
means
possession
of
lands
belonging
to
indians.
this
consideration
rendered
it
highly
important
that
this
whole
business
should
be
under
the
absolute
and
sole
direction
of
public
authority.
turning
to
the
statutory
language,
which
is
where
we
should
first
go
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
private
right
of
action,
you
will
find
that
there
is
no
mention
in
the
statute
whatsoever
of
creating
a
private
right.
you
will
also
find,
however,
that
there
are
remedies
and
provisions
provided
in
the
statute
that
deal
with
instances
in
which
it
is
violated.
it
is
principally
a
criminal
statute.
there
are
provisions
for
criminal
fines.
there
are
provisions
for
jail.
and
there
are
also
provisions
that
permit
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
call
out
the
military
to
move
the
settlers
off
the
land.
but
there
is
no
reference
to
a
private
right
of
action
by
an
indian
tribe.
this
should
not
be
surprising
because
indian
tribes
were
not
admitted
into
the
courts.
they
were
not
expected
to
have
any
right
to
go
to
court
in
1793.
indeed,
it
wasn't
until
the
twentieth
century
when
indian
tribes
first
began
to
be
able
to
come
into
the
courts.
prior
to
that
time
there
were
a
few
special
legislative
acts
allowing
indian
tribes
access
to
the
court,
but
certainly
in
1793
they
were
not
in
the
courts.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
this
is
an
argument,
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
issue
of
the
intent
of
the
congress
in
1793,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
intent
of
the
congress,
among
other
things,
in
addition
to
what
its
plain
language
said,
has
to
be
drawn
from
congress'
understanding
of
what
was
happening
at
the
time.
one
of
the
difficulties
in
these
indian
cases
is
to
enable
us
to
put
ourselves
in
the
position
of
the
drafters
of
these
statutes
at
that
time,
and
i
think
the
intent
of
congress
has
to
be
drawn,
among
other
things,
from
their
knowledge
of
whether
indian
tribes
were
in
court,
were
permitted
to
be
in
court.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
in
my
reading
of
the
cases
of
this
court
since
1975,
it
is
the
intent
of
congress
as
to
whether
the
indians
should
have
a
right
of
action
under
the
particular
statute.
it
isn't
that
congress
failed
to
provide
remedies,
but
the
remedies
it
provided
were
remedies
for
the
government
to
enforce,
and
it
is
quite
understandable
why
they
did
that.
what
this
statute
was
designed
to
do
was
to
regulate
what
was
occurring
on
the
frontier,
probably
the
least
regulatable
area
in
american
history.
you
have
a
situation
in
which
there
are
settlers
many,
many
miles
from
a
government
which
was
weak
and
almost
nonexistent.
to
attempt
to
regulate
those
people
and
what
they
were
doing
other
than
by
having
some
control
in
the
central
government
was
near
impossible.
to
suggest
that
the
congress
in
1793
assumed
that
that
regulation
could
be
affected
by
lawsuits
between
the
indians
and
the
settlers
on
the
frontier
is
to
me
astounding.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
if
the
action
were
brought
in
state
court
and
it
were,
as
to
use
your
words
in
the
'74
opinion,
a
garden
variety
ejectment
action,
presumably
it
would
be
subject
to
the
state
law,
including
the
defenses
that
would
be
available
in
a
state
court.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
such
as
the
statute
of
limitations,
such
as
adverse
possession,
the
various
kinds
of
things
that
are
said
at
least
by
the
lower
courts
not
to
apply
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
trade
and
intercourse
act
case
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
perhaps
i
misunderstand
your
question.
if
you
are
saying
in
1970
when
this
case
was
brought,
what
would
be
the
result
in
the
state
court
in
new
york,
i
suspect
it
wouldn't
last
more
than
a
week
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
the
federal
question,
i
think
what
you
would
come
to
then,
your
honor,
is
whether
a
right
of
action
was
intended
under
that
statute.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i
don't
think
new
york
could
give
a
right
of
action
under
the
1793
federal
trade
and
intercourse
act.
new
york
under
its
common
law
could
provide
a
common
law
claim.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i
don't
know
whether
by
federal
law,
justice
white.
it
seems
to
me
before
you
implicate
the
federal
law,
you
would
end
up
dealing
with
the
state
law,
and
i
have
no
difficulty,
and
i
would
not
argue
here
with
these
claims
being
brought
in
a
state
court.
the
essence,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
1974
decision
here
is
that
they
are
inappropriate
in
a
state
court.
indeed,
the
district
court
judge,
judge
port,
dismissed
this
action,
and
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
dismissal
on
the
grounds
that
the
case
should
be
litigated
in
the
state
court
system,
this
court
first.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
private
right
of
action
is
an
important
issue,
and
i
really
don't
mean
to
back
down
from
it
in
any
sense.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i
appreciate
that,
too,
mr.
justice
white.
i
will
pass,
at
the
suggestion
of
justice
rehnquist,
to
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
because
you
do
have
a
situation
whereby
if
it
is
to
be
determined
that
there
is
a
right
of
action,
and
if
this
case
can
be
brought,
then
you
must
decide,
well,
can
it
be
brought
175
years
after
the
cause
of
action
accrued?
in
this
instance,
since
we
are
dealing
with
a
federal
statute,
we
must
first
look
to
see
if
there
is
a
federal
statute
of
limitations,
and
there
is
none.
under
that
circumstance,
the
law
seems
fairly
clear
that
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
to
borrow
the
most
nearly
appropriate
state
statute
of
limitations.
that
is
something
that
this
court
has
recognized,
indeed
as
recently
as
june
of
this
year,
in
the
opinion
of
burnett
v.
gratton.
in
that
case
the
state
statute
of
limitations
in
the
state
of
maryland
was
borrowed
in
connection
with
an
action
brought
under
the
civil
rights
statutes.
it
seems
equally
appropriate
here
to
borrow
the
nearest
appropriate
new
york
state
statute
of
limitations,
and
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
in
the
state
of
new
york
that
is
longer
than
20
years,
so
that
any
statute
that
you
borrowed
would
certainly
long
since
have
barred
this
action.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
it
has
no
bearing
whatsoever.
that
is
a
statute
that
relates
to
actions
brought
by
the
united
states
government
for
money
damages
on
behalf
of
indians.
it
is
not
a
statute
that
is
designed
to
deal
with
claims
by
indians
themselves.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i
realize
that,
your
honor,
and
respectfully--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--well,
my
"whatsoever"
comes
from
a
reading
of
the
statutory
history
and
the
discussion
by
those
in
congress
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
that
statute.
i
would
also
point
out
that
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
statute
that
was
created
only
relatively
recently
under
this
court's
decision
in
stewart
v.
keyes
to
create
and
bring
back
into
being
a
cause
that
had
long
since
abated
as
a
result
of
the
statute
is
something
that
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
so
i
really
do
not
think
that
you
can
do
anything
with
2415
that
relates
to
this
particular
case.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
correct,
which
is
a
conclusion
that
i
think
is
inappropriate.
it
is
a
conclusion
i
think
that
flows
from
the
theory
that
the
indians
must
have
precisely
the
same
rights
as
the
united
states.
in
indian
law
in
particular
that
is
a
situation
that
does
not
obtain.
in
many,
many
instances,
the
indians
do
not
have
the
same
rights
as
their
guardian,
as
the
united
states.
in
trust
law
it
is
a
common
principle
that
the
guardian
has
rights
that
the
ward
does
not
have.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i
don't
think
so,
respectfully,
your
honor.
i
think
what
you
have
in
part
is
yet
another
effort
by
the
federal
government
to
bring
an
end
to
these
indian
claims,
not
dissimilar
from
that
that
occurred
when
the
indian
claims
commission
was
formed
in
1946.
it
is
an
effort
to
ferret
out
and
find
out
what
claims
are
available,
to
give
those
indians
who
feel
they
have
a
claim
an
opportunity
to
present
them
to
the
federal
government
for
action.
but
again,
it
is
a
money
damages
statute
by
the
federal
government,
not
by
indians.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i
would
assume
that
probably
there
would
not
be
a
statute
of
limitations
against
the
united
states.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
you
are
talking
now
about
2415,
your
honor,
or
about
some
other
section?
mr.
allan
van
gestel
under
2415,
until
the
time
runs
out
which
is
contained
therein,
the
united
states
could
bring
an
action.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
if
my
memory
serves
me,
it
runs
out
at
the
end
of
this
year.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i
think
it
is
december
31,
1984,
if
i
recall
correctly.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i
think
ewert
v.
bluejacket
suggests
that
state
statutes
do
not
apply,
justice
o'connor.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
state
statute
applies;
i
am
suggesting
that
the
principle
in
federal
law
that
when
there
is
no
federal
statute,
the
federal
courts
borrow
the
state
statute
and
make
it
part
of
the
federal
law
is
what
applies.
i
don't
think
that
was
the
issue
at
all
in
ewert
v.
bluejacket.
i
would
suggest
one
other
thing
while
i
am
talking
about
the
issue
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
that
is
the
issue
of
abatement
that
we
have
raised.
the
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act
is
not
a
single
statute
that
has
been
in
existence
since
1790
down
to
the
present
date.
indeed,
when
you
examine
it
you
will
see
that
it
is
a
series
of
separate,
specifically
limited
statutes
in
the
early
years,
1790,
1793,
1796,
'99
and
1802.
it
wasn't
until
1834
that
it
became
a
single
statute.
and
with
the
expiration
of
each
statute,
any
claims
that
may
have
existed,
assuming
you
find
there
to
be
a
right
of
action
under
it,
would
abate
under
the
law
as
it
applied
at
that
time.
now,
i
think
another
thing
that
we
have
to
discuss
and
have
to
consider
in
dealing
with
this
kind
of
case,
another
defense,
is
a
defense
of
ratification.
the
law,
it
would
seem,
suggests...
and
have
in
mind
that
the
concern
here
is
that
the
state
of
new
york,
when
it
purchased
the
land
in
1795,
did
not
do
it
in
the
presence
of
a
federal
commissioner.
that
is
the
deficiency,
and
the
sole
deficiency.
the
state
of
new
york
a
couple
of
years
later,
in
1798,
purchased
some
additional
land
in
the
presence
of
a
federal
commissioner,
and
nobody
has
any
concern
or
argues
that
that
was
in
any
way
inappropriate.
cases
have
determined
that
ratification
of
these
kinds
of
transactions
can
occur
after
the
transactions
themselves
have
occurred.
that
is,
if
the
federal
government
takes
certain
steps
that
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
knowledge
of
the
transaction
and
there
is
an
implicit
ratification,
then
that
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
a
number
of
instances
in
which
that
ratification
applies.
in
particular,
the
next
two
purchases
by
the
state
of
new
york
from
the
oneida
indians,
in
adjacent
land,
were
purchases
that
were
made
in
the
presence
of
the
appropriate
federal
commissioner.
they
were
purchases
that
were
appropriate
in
every
respect
under
the
statute.
those
purchases
made
reference
back
to
the
1795
purchase.
they
described
it
as
a
purchase.
they
did
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
subsequent
cases
have
suggested
as
sufficient
to
retroactively
ratify.
but
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
had
175
years,
approximately,
of
history,
of
the
federal
government
acting
with
regard
to
the
land
in
issue
here
as
if
that
land
was
owned
by
the
people
who
live
on
it
today.
the
federal
government
has
taken
land
and
built
post
offices,
it
has
built
federal
highways,
it
has
taxed
people,
it
has
done
everything
that
you
would
expect
it
to
do
to
in
effect
say
to
those
citizens,
yes,
this
is
your
land
and
you
own
it.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
justice
stevens,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
do.
the
land,
you
are
correct,
the
land
in
this
particular
case
that
is
involved
is
owned
by
the
counties
of
madison
and
oneida.
they
are
separate
entities.
indeed,
they
have
brought--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--they
acquired
it...
they
were
created
in
part
cut
of
this
land.
they
didn't
exist
at
the
time,
but
they
were
created
out
of
it,
and
their
title
would
come
from
the
state
of
new
york,
just
as
would
the
title
of
everyone
else
in
that
area.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i
cannot
as
i
stand
here
say
that
some
of
the
county
land
didn't
come
from
somewhere
else.
there
may
have
been
a
taking
to
build
a
county
highway
or
something
like
that.
but
principally
the
land
came
from
the
state
of
new
york.
however,
i
don't
think
the
counties
are
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
sense
that
the
state
and
the
counties
are
one.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
and
i
would
remind
the
court--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--yes.
and
i
would
remind
the
court
that
what
judge
port
determined
and
the
second
circuit
affirmed
was
that
the
transaction
was
invalid,
the
purchase
in
1795
was
invalid.
that's
the
entire
100,000
acres
of
land
in
question.
now,
the
private
landowners
were
not
parties
to
the
litigation
and
therefore
in
theory
i
suppose
they
could
raise
defenses
later
on,
but
once
this
case
deciding
that
that
purchase
was
invalid
has
gone
all
the
way
through
the
system,
their
chances
to
raise
defenses
are
greatly
diminished.
i
think
in
sum,
on
the
issue
of
ratification,
the
action
by
the
federal
government
cannot
be
ignored,
and
that
action
really
is
175
years
of
treating
these
people,
these
counties,
as
if
this
were
their
land.
i
would
conclude
my
remarks
regarding
the
indians
by
suggesting
to
this
court
that
when
you
have
a
moment
to
reflect
on
this
case
and
you
think
for
a
moment
about
the
result
of
finding
for
the
indians
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
political
issue.
a
finding
for
the
indians
means
in
effect
that
100,000
acres
of
land
falls
under
the
sovereignty
of
an
indian
tribe.
it
means
that
it
has
always
been
their
land.
it
means
that
175
years
of
citizens
living
on
that
land
have
been
trespassers,
have
been
living
under
a
law
that
had
no
place,
that
is,
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
it
means
that
the
people
who
are
there
today
who
have
abided
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
are
left
in
the
middle.
it
is
an
issue,
while
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
particular
framework
of
political
question,
as
that
is
a
word
of
art,
it
is
a
political
issue
certainly.
i
don't--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--that
is
the
dollar
amount,
yes,
justice
brennan.
the
court...
it
was
about
872
acres
is
the
land.
that
land,
as
you
might
assume,
is
principally
county
highways,
so
the
appraisal
of
the
value
of
a
county
highway,
something
50
yards
wide
and
a
mile
and
a
half
long,
results
in
these
very
low
numbers.
but
it
isn't
the
dollar
value
which
is
the
impact
of
the
determination.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
no,
there
is
no
issue
as
to
dollar
value.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
the
broader
scope,
your
honor,
is
that
if
it
is
determined
that
there
is
a
right
of
action
under
the
trade
and
intercourse
act,
or
if
it
is
determined
that
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
bar
or
there
cannot
be
retroactive
ratification
or
this
is
not
a
political
question,
then
in
this
particular
area
you
have
the
next
shoe
dropping,
the
next
suit
for
the
balance
of
the
100,000
acres
against
the
private
landowners.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
essentially
all
of
which
is
in
private
ownership.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
well,
that
is
an
issue
that
we
debated
in
the
lower
court,
your
honor,
but
nevertheless,
when
you
take
the
value
back
175
years
and
apply
interest,
you
have
a
situation
that
is
wholly
unmanageable.
you
also
have
title
to
the
land.
you
have
a
situation
which
i
don't
think
is
good
for
our
system.
you
may
have
several
thousand
people
told
that
they
have
to
leave
their
land.
i
am
not
sure
they
will
do
it.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
all
of
this
could
be
cured
by
congress,
yes,
justice
blackmun.
i
would
like
just
ever
so
briefly
in
the
time
that
i
have
left...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
the
congress
may
well
have
to
pay
out
some
money,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i'm
not
so
sure
of
that.
the
congress
can
ratify
this
transaction,
and
indeed,
i
remind
the
court--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--i,
regrettably,
it
hasn't--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--it
hasn't
done
so
thus
far,
but--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--that,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--it
doesn't
sound
very
nice,
either,
but
i
am
not
sure
it
is
the
basis
to
hold
the
private
landowners
hostage.
don't
forget
that
in
1951
the
same
oneida
indians
brought
their
claim
before
the
indian
claims
commission
provided
by
congress
and
were
successful,
successful
to
the
point
of
winning
a
liability
judgment,
and
then
determined
for
tactical
reasons
not
to
go
forward
and
collect
the
money
that
they
could
have
collected
at
that
time.
well,
let
me
say
very
briefly--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--the
tactical
reason
being
that
they
felt
they
would
lose
the
ability--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--to
bring
this
suit,
yes.
let
me
turn
now
from
the
indians,
if
i
may,
to
the
state
of
new
york,
who
is
my
other
opponent
in
this
case,
and
just
say
ever
so
briefly
in
the
time
that
is
left
that
if
the
court
feels
that
it
is
appropriate
to
permit
the
indians'
claim
to
go
forward,
it
certainly
ought
to
be
flexible
enough
and
ought
to
be
creative
enough
to
find
an
ability
for
the
innocent
people
to
collect
from
the
guilty
one.
the
state
of
new
york
was
the
one
who
participated
in
this
transaction,
not
the
landowners
today,
not
the
counties
which
didn't
exist,
so
that
any
sense
of
equity
would
suggest
that
there
ought
to
be
a
way
to
recover
from
the
state.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
they
do
agree
on
the
merits,
and
i
think
we
should
win
on
the
merits,
your
honor,
but
nevertheless,
assuming
we
do
not,
we
then
face
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
i
suggest
that
under
the
analysis
set
forth
in
our
brief,
what
the
state
of
new
york
did
was
they
waived
their
eleventh
amendment
rights
when
the
state
of
new
york
ratified
the
united
states
constitution
in
september
of
1788,
which
included,
among
other
things,
the
commerce
clause
which
placed--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--i'm
unaware
of
a
state
ground,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
none
that
i'm
aware
of,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
once
the
state
of
new
york
agreed
that
all
management
of
affairs
with
indians
fell
in
with
the
federal
government,
therefore
they
were
in
a
position
in
which
they
waived
their
rights.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
i
doubt
it,
i
doubt
it.
you
would
have
to
find
a
way
under...
new
york
has
a
court
of
claims
statute,
and
they
have
a
court
of
claims
act
in
some
respects
similar
to
the
federal
court
of
claims,
but
not
in
all
respects.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
we
certainly
would
try,
but
i'm
not
at
all
confident
that--
mr.
allan
van
gestel
--i
suppose
the
defense,
among
other
things,
would
be
a
sovereign
immunity
type
defense.
mr.
allan
van
gestel
there
is
already
litigation
pending
against
the
state,
thus
far
not
successful.
thank
you.
