justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
van
gestel,
is...
the
land
here
that
is
in
dispute
in
this
case
is
owned
by
counties.
do
they
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
state
of
new
york,
or
were
there
intervening
transfers
of
ownership?
justice
stevens
did
they
acquire
it
directly
from
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
stevens
but
there
has
been
no
intervening
ownership
in
private
hands.
so
this
is
really,
is
it
more
or
less
the
same
as
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
state
of
new
york
itself?
the
reason
i
ask
is
because
in
the
ewert
case
it
was
the
original
transferee
who
was
held
not
to
be
barred.
justice
stevens
you
think
you
have
the
same,
just
as
strong
a
position
as
if
you
were
a
private,
innocent
purchaser
through
good
faith,
a
third
party
purchaser?
justice
stevens
this
case
is
then,
on
that
basis,
the
case
is
quite
different
from
the
ewert
case.
justice
stevens
but
there
is
no
issue
as
to
dollar
value?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question
on
the
eleventh
amendment?
supposing
we
held
the
eleventh
amendment
denies
you
access
to
the
federal
court
here?
couldn't
you
sue
them
in
state
court?
justice
stevens
that's
not
quite
an
accurate
reading
of
that
subsection.
it
certainly
isn't.
it
says
nothing
herein
contained
shall
bar
a
statute.
yes.
it
doesn't
say
there's
no
statute
of
limitations.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
don't
you
first
have
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
action
had
not
been
barred
prior
to
1966?
yes.
justice
stevens
because
if
it
was
barred
in
1966,
that
statute
doesn't
revive
any
already
barred
claims,
does
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
maybe
congress
was
wrong
in
thinking
that.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
what
the
law,
not
what
congress
thought
the
law
was.
and
that's
just
the
view
of
one
congress.
justice
stevens
i
understand
they
argue
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
must
look
to
state
law
before
1966
first
of
all,
and
i
think
you
rely
on
the
ewert
case,
and
that's
all
you've
got
for
the
prior
period,
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
we
are
not
bound
by
the
ninth
circuit.
no,
we
sure
aren't.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
you
rely
on
the
1982
statute
to
tell
us
what
the
1966
statute
meant.
justice
stevens
but
you
must
acknowledge
the
possibility
that
the
assumption
was
erroneous.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
didn't
congress
say
something
else
in
the
rules
of
decision
act
which
was
enacted
at
about
the
same
time?
justice
stevens
didn't
congress
say
something
rather
express
about
when
there
is
no
federal
rule
of
law,
you
lock
to
state
law.
justice
stevens
in
the
rules
of
decision
act,
which
was
enacted
way
back
in
the
time
you
are
talking
about.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
those
are
rules
you
get
to
after
you
get
ever
the
statute
of
limitations
bar
and
you
get
to
the
merits.
justice
stevens
fine.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
imagine
most
of
them
have
statutes
that
are
shorter
than
175
years.
justice
stevens
so
i
think
the
uniformity
problem
may
not
be
very
serious.
justice
stevens
which
congress
expressly
said
they
wanted
in
the
statute
of
limitations
area
in
1983
litigation.
there
used
to
be
all
sorts
of
federal
claims
having
this
very
problem
in
them.
justice
stevens
and
i
agree
with
you
it
is
not
a
very
wise
solution,
but
congress
seems
to
be
happy
with
it.
justice
stevens
ms.
locklear,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
laches?
as
i
read
the
ewert
case,
if
the
state
statute
of
limitations
has
run,
then
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
in
a
case
such
as
this
to
disprove
laches.
justice
stevens
and
i
think
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
an
absence
of
laches,
if
the
ewert
case
applies.
so
i
am
not
sure
you
can
escape
it
that
easily.
justice
stevens
and
then
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
you
are
not
just
slightly
at
odds
with
the
government,
you
are
180
degrees
apart
from
them
on
this
question.
justice
stevens
why
would
that
be
so?
the
government
would
have
to
bring
a
suit,
that's
all--
justice
stevens
--they'd
all
be
barred.
justice
stevens
it
is
unusual
to
hear
the
suggestion
that
getting
rid
of
a
great
mass
of
litigation
would
cause
chaos.
justice
stevens
what
were
you
reading
from,
mr.
kneedler?
what
were
you
reading
from?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
what
source?
justice
stevens
who
was
one
of
the
proponents
of
the
bill?
