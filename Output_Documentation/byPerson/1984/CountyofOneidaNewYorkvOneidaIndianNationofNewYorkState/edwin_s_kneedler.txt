mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
have
suggested
in
this
case
that
it
is
a...
that
it
presents
questions
or
issues
of
broad
importance
affecting
numerous
eastern
land
claims.
one
cannot
ignore,
and
we
do
not
ignore
the
eastern
land
claims
that
have
been
brought.
but
in
this
case,
the
issues
that
plaintiffs
have
brought
to
this
court
are
limited,
and
principally
the
ones
that
i
will
address
now
are
the
application
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
setting
and
also,
to
a
lesser
extent,
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
the
claim
is
limited;
all
i
meant
is
that
the
issues
are
confined.
the
number
of
issues
in
this
case
are
confined
to
a
few.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
fact,
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
is
that
the
arguments
that
are
being
advanced
here
go
far
beyond
eastern
land
claims,
and
they
go
far
beyond
old
claims
as
opposed
to
new
ones.
what
the
petitioners
are
arguing
for
with
respect
to
the
application
of
state
statutes
of
limitation
would
be
a
radical
departure
from
what
has
been
the
accepted
norm
in
the
area
with
respect
to
indian
law
for
the
entire
existence
of
this
nation,
and
it
could
cause
considerable
disruption
in
the
administration
of
indian
affairs.
now,
it
is
true
that
this
case
presents
a
claim
that
is
175
years
old,
but
the
problem
that
a
state
statute
of
limitations
should
be
barred
as
the
applicable
rule
in
a
suit
by
indians,
if
applied
to
the
everyday
administration
of
indian
affairs,
could
be
quite
chaotic
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--one
of
the
difficulties
is
that
the...
as--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--what
the
effect
would
be
would
be
to
create
pressure
for
the
united
states
to
sue
in
perhaps
a
shorter
period
of
time
to
resolve
the
claim
in
its
own
mind
in
a
shorter
period
of
time
than
congress
has
intended
to
allow
the
united
states
to
have
in
assessing
a
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that's
right,
but
one
of
the...
but
it's
important
that
in
the
background
of
the
extensions
of
the
statutes
of
limitation,
one
of
the
things
congress
focused
on
each
time
it
extended
the
statute
of
limitations
was
the
vast
number
of
claims
that
the
interior
department
had
to
deal
with,
specifically,
in
that
case,
the
claims
that
predated
1966.
but
this
is
by
no
means
unique
to
the
older
claims.
all
the
time
in
the
daily
administration
of
the
interior
department's
programs
there
are
indian
claims
that
arise.
congress
specified
in
2415
that
the
united
states
ordinarily
is
to
have
six
years
within
which
to
bring
an
indian
claim.
now,
if
there
was
a
one
year
statute
of
limitations
on
a
particular
claim,
the
interior
department
would
be
required
effectively
to
decide
within
a
year
as
to
whether
the
claim
had
merit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
i
had
understood
petitioners
to
be
arguing
that
the
2415
and
the
indian
claims
limitation
act
of
1982
have
nothing
to
do
with
claims
brought
by
tribes,
and
we
think
that
that
is
clearly
wrong
both
because,
as
ms.
locklear
pointed
out,
that
the
text
and
legislative
history
of
the
act
shows
that
congress
intended
it
to
apply
to
indian
claims,
but
also
that
it
is
the
appropriate
source
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
specifically
with
respect
to
the
procedures
that
ms.
locklear
referred
to
before
with
respect
to
furnishing
the
tribes,
this
is
the
procedure
for
the
older
damage
claims,
with
respect
to
furnishing
the
tribes
with
the
information
about
their
claims
and
giving
them
one
year
within
which
to
assess
it,
and
then
the
indian
claims
limitation
act
says
that
any
cause
of
action
not
brought
within
a
year
shall
be
barred,
not
just
a
cause
of
action
by
the
united
states,
and
this
isn't
just
in
2415.
there
was
a
supplemental
statute
that
amended
2415
called
the
indian
claims
limitations
act
which
specifically
says
any
cause
of
action,
not
just
a
cause
of
action
by
the
united
states,
shall
be
barred
if
not
brought
within
one
year
of
the
time
the
information
was
furnished
to
the
tribe.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
what
they
are
are
the
most
recent
manifestation
of
the
accepted
rule
that
has
governed
in
indian
law.
this
court
in
a
number
of
decisions,
united
states
v.
minnesota
being
perhaps
the
leading
one,
but
also
most
recently
in
united
states
v.
nevada
and
others,
has
held
that
the
united
states,
when
suing
on
behalf
of
indians,
that
the
usual
rule
that
statutes
of
limitation
and
laches
do
not
apply
to
such
suits,
apply
when
the
united
states
sues
on
behalf
of
indians.
so
it
is
clear
that
with
respect
to
the
united
states
bringing
this
suit
that
no
statute
of
limitations
or
laches
would
apply.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
i
think
that
the
background
that
the
united
states
is
not
barred
is
important
with
respect
to
this
because
the
united...
when
the
united
states
is
litigating
in
the
area
of
indian
affairs,
it
is
typically
bringing
a
cause
of
action
with
respect
to
property
that
it
holds
in
trust
for
a
beneficiary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
united
states
is
not
litigating
here,
but
we
do
believe
that
the
tribe
has
a
right
to
bring
its
action,
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
points
i
was
making
before,
it
is
essential
to
carrying
out
the
secretary's
trust
responsibility
to
enable
tribes
to
bring
causes
of
action.
this
one
is
quite
old,
but
again,
the
principle
applies
to
more
recent
claims.
it
is
essential
that
tribes
and
individuals
be
able
to
bring
actions
on
their
own
behalf.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
goes
back
quite
a
period
of
time.
individual
indians--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--have
sued
for
150
years
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--tribes,
it
depends...
tribes
it
typically
depended
on--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that's
right,
but
for
tribes,
it
typically
depended
on
whether
they
were
perceived
as
having
the
capacity
to
sue
as
a
juristic
person,
much
like
a
labor
union
or
some
other
association.
there
was
no
considered
congressional
judgment
that
tribes
were
going
to
be
litigating
about
issues
that
were
inappropriate
for
judicial
resolution.
,
it
was
simply
that
tribes
were
not
organized,
they
were
not
corporations,
and
therefore
didn't
have
the
capacity
to
sue
in
that
sense.
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
intended
to
confer
legal
rights
on
tribes
in
the
treaties
and
by
conferring
property
rights
on
them,
and
the
normal
incidence
of
a
property
right
is
that
a
person
can
bring
an
action
in
ejectment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
if
one--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
is,
but
normally
under
accepted
principles
of
trust
law,
if
the
trustee
does
not
bring
an
action
on
behalf
of
the
beneficiary,
the
beneficiary
can
bring
the
action
himself,
and
one
of
the
problems
with
applying
a
shorter
limitations
period--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
separately
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
these
are...
the
tribe
has
its
own
rights.
these
are--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
not
that
the
tribe
is
ignoring
a
statute
that
otherwise
applies.
congress
has
not
applied
a
statute--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
united
states
clearly
would
not
be
barred
by
a
statute
of
limitations
except
where
congress
has
made
it
applicable.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
in
effect,
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
because
congress
repeatedly
has
made
the
judgment,
in
our
view,
and
i
would
like
to,
because
it
has
specific
relevance
to
this
case,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
legislative...
the
text
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
233
of
title
25,
which
was
enacted
in
1950
to
give
new
york
jurisdiction
over
indian
affairs,
and
the
court
discussed
this
provision
in
its
1974
opinion
in
this
case,
and
congress
enacted
a
proviso
to
section
233
that
says
nothing
in
this
statute
shall
be
construed
as
making
applicable
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
civil
actions
involving
indian
lands
or
claims
with
respect
thereto
which
relate
to
transactions
or
events
transpiring
prior
to
1952.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what
the
legislative
history
shows
of
this,
it
shows
that
congress
understood
what
the
prevailing
rule
was,
that
statutes
of
limitation
did
not
apply,
and
if
i
could
just
read
the
two
sentences
of
the
person
who
was
explaining
this
provision,
he
says,
as
it
is
now,
the
indians,
as
we
know,
are
wards
of
the
government
and
therefore
the
statute
of
limitations
does
not
run
against
them
as
it
does
in
the
ordinary
case.
this
will
preserve
their
rights
so
that
the
statute
will
not
be
running
against
them
concerning
those
claims
that
might
have
arisen
before
the
passage
of
this
act.
now,
that
is
an
expression
of
congressional
intent
which
specifically
applies
to
the
very
claim
in
this
suit,
a
claim
arising
on
the
state
of
new
york
prior
to
1952.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm...
i
was...
this
is
on
page
22
of
my
brief.
it
is
from--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
from
the
congressional
record,
volume
96,
page
12040.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
the
remarks
of
representative
morris.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
it
was
his
remarks
that
the
court
quoted
from
in
the
1974
oneida
opinion.
in
fact,
this
paragraph
was
between
the
two,
the
two
portions
of
his
remarks
that
the
court
relied
upon
in
oneida,
one
in
saying
that
the
new
york
indians
should
have
a
right
to
go
into
federal
court.
if
i
could
go
back
even
further,
and
this
also
ties
in
to
a
question
that
justice
rehnquist
had
in
an
earlier
time
about
what
would
happen
if
the
oneidas
went
into
state
court,
and
in
this
regard,
it
is
useful
to
lock
at
the
case
of
seneca
nation
v.
christy
in
162
u.s.
and
the
underlying
state
court
decisions.
the
first
aspect
of
the
case
that
is
important
for
this
point
is
the
fact
that
it
was
a
cause
of
action
to
invalidate
a
transaction
under
the
trade
and
intercourse
act
by
an
indian
tribe.
it
failed
for
other
reasons
in
state
court,
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
the
lower
court
never
suggested
that
an
indian
tribe
didn't
have
a
right
to
invoke
the
trade
and
intercourse
act.
what
the
court,
the
state
court
dismissed
the
claim
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
and
this
court
declined
to
review
it
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
separate
federal
question
involved,
on
the
ground
that
the
state
had
furnished
the
indian
tribe
a
special
state
statutory
remedy,
and
that
the
tribe
had
to
comply
with
the
procedures
under
that
special
remedy,
which
was
the
application
of
the
state
statute
of
limitations.
but
even
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
careful
to
point
out
the
question
is
not
whether
an
indian
title
can
be
barred
by
adverse
possession
or
by
state
statutes
of
limitation;
the
point
is
that
the
plaintiff
cannot
invoke
the
special
remedy
given
by
statute
without
being
bound
by
the
conditions
upon
which
it
is
given.
so
this
is
a
decision
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
itself
in
1891
recognizing
that
to
apply
state
law
to
wholly
bar
the
claim
would
be
inappropriate,
but
that
state
law
applied
because
the
state
had
furnished
a
special
remedy.
so
we
have
a
continuing
understanding
that
indian,
that
statutes
of
limitation
do
not
apply
to
claims
brought
by
indians,
and
in
fact,
if
one
looks
at
the
text
of
the
trade
and
intercourse
acts
from
1790
onward,
they,
too,
furnish
a
compelling
indication
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
state
statutes
of
limitation
to
apply.
they
say
that
no
transaction
or
title
or
claim
to
indian
property
shall
be
of
any
validity
in
law
or
equity,
strongly
suggesting
that
for
a
court
to
apply
a
statute
of
limitations
or
laches
where
congress
had
not
specified
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
voiding
such
transactions.
in
fact,
where
congress
has
intended
to
apply
state
statutes
of
limitation
to
indian
claims,
it
has
done
so
expressly;
for
example,
in
25
u.s.c.
347,
which
deals
with
claims
for
allotments,
congress
has
expressly
applied
state
statutes
of
limitation.
and
finally,
under
this
court's
analysis
in
delcostello
of
last
term,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
appropriate
analogy
for
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
area
is
to
refer
to
federal
law,
to
which
the
trustee
would
be
bound.
i
would
like
to
make
two
other
points.
one,
we
do
believe
the
congress
can
extinguish,
justice
white,
the
title
in
this
area
simply
by
ratifying
the
transaction
as
it
had
the
right
to
do
in
1795.
and
lastly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
congress
has
shown
a
readiness
to
extinguish
these
claims
when
the
parties
come
into
agreement,
and
if
there
was
going
to
be
widespread
disarrangement
in
new
york
state
because
of
these
claims,
i
think
that
congress
could
be
expected
to
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
under
our
reading,
congress
would
have
to
act.
with
respect
to
the
equitable
claims
in
the
case,
we
do
not
suggest
at
this
point
that
laches
would
actually
entirely
bar
the
suit.
our
analysis
was
directed
at
some
considerations
that
should
be
taken
into
account
in
future
claims
against
private
landowners,
particularly,
and
in
fact,
if
applied
in
this
case,
we
think
there
is
some
chance
that
even
the
damage
award
that
would
be
applied
in
this
particular
case
would
not
be
sustained.
one
last
point
i
would
like
to
make,
that
in
these
cases,
although
petitioners
tend
to
paint
with
broad
brush
with
respect
to
eastern
land
claims,
in
fact,
the
process
of
resolving
them
has
turned
out
to
be
fairly
orderly.
in
many
cases
there
is
a
specific
basis
on
which
the
claim
can
be
found
to
have
been
extinguished.
in
this
case
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
the
treaty
of
buffalo
creek
and
the
subsequent
litigation
in
new
york
indians
v.
united
states,
which
may
provide
a
basis
for
finding
that
the
claim
was
extinguished
without
resorting
to
statutes
of
limitation.
