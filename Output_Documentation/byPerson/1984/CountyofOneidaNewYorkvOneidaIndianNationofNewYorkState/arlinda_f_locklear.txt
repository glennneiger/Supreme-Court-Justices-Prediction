ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
events
that
gave
rise
to
this
litigation
occurred
during
this
countrys'
very
infancy.
during
the
revolutionary
war,
the
oneida
indian
nation
fought
as
this
country's
steadfast
ally.
as
a
result
of
that
alliance,
the
oneida
nations
villages
were
burned,
and
the
oneidas
were
forced
to
vacate
their
lands.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
revolutionary
war,
the
united
states,
as
a
show
of
faith
and
appreciation
for
the
service
of
its
ally,
guaranteed
the
oneidas
the
continued
possession
of
its
lands.
that
guarantee
appears
in
three
federal
treaties
over
a
period
of
ten
years:
first,
the
1784
treaty
of
fort
stanwix,
second,
the
1789
treaty
of
fort
harmar,
and
third,
the
1794
treaty
of
canandaigua.
the
treaty
of
canandaigua,
the
last
of
those
three,
still
remains
in
force
and
effect
between
the
parties.
in
fact,
the
oneidas
today
continue
to
receive
annuity
payments
under
the
treaty
of
canandaigua.
despite
these
treaty
guarantees,
on
september
15,
1795,
the
state
of
new
york
purported
to
purchase
approximately
100,000
acres
of
the
treaty
guaranteed
lands.
there
is
no
doubt
in
this
case
that
that
purchase
was
in
violation
of
the
1793
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act.
the
parties
here
do
not
dispute
that
fact.
neither
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
that
transaction
was
concluded
by
the
state
with
foreknowledge
that
it
was
acting
in
violation
of
federal
law.
the
unrefuted
evidence
in
this
case
establishes
clearly
that
governor
jay
had
been
directly
informed
by
then
secretary
of
war
pickering
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
attorney
general
at
that
time,
mr.
bradford,
that
the
1793
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act
applied
to
state
purchases
of
indian
land,
and
where
the
state
purported
to
act
without
the
consent
of
the
federal
government,
applied
to
void
those
transactions.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not,
but
what
it
does
do
is
indicate--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--what
it
does
do
in
this
case,
justice
white,
is
indicate
that
the
state
was
acting
not
in
ignorance
of
the
law
but
had
been
put
on
notice
that
at
least
in
the
view
of--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--had
that
been
the
case,
one
might
have
expected
a
response,
but
governor
jay
did
not
respond.
rather,
governor--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--that's
possible,
your
honor,
that's
entirely
possible.
we
do
not
have
any
historic
evidence
on
that
point,
but
the
point
remains
that
governor
jay
acted
not
out
of
ignorance
of
the
statute
and
at
least
its
interpretation
by
the
united
states,
but
acted
with
knowledge
of
the
interpretation
of
attorney
general
bradford.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
finally,
it
is--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--pardon
me.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
third,
it
is
also
important
in
this
case
that
none
of
the
parties
disputes
that
the
united
states
could
achieve
essentially
the
same
relief
that
to
oneida
parties
are
seeking
today.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
so
then
the
question
is
a
very
narrow
one
before
this
court,
and
that
is
only
whether
the
oneidas
can
seek
to
set
aside
an
admittedly
void
transaction
of
the
united
states--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--yes,
your
honor.
what
i
will
deal
with
my
remarks
this
afternoon
will
be,
first
of
all,
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action,
very
briefly,
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
asserted
by
the
petitioners
today,
and
the
defense
of
implied
ratification
asserted
by
the
petitioners.
first,
the
cause
of
action
issue.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
appropriate
at
this
point
to
make
two
simple
observations,
and
then
i
will
conclude
my
remarks
on
this
point.
one
is
that
we
cannot
construe
the
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act
in
a
vacuum.
at
the
time,
congress
was
acting
against
a
background
of
clearly
established
federal
law
principles,
two
of
those
important
principles
were
at
the
time,
first,
that
the
indian
tribes
had
acknowledged
under
principles
of
international
law
exclusive
rights
to
occupancy
to
their
land,
and
secondly,
that
those
exclusive
rights
of
occupancy
could
be
extinguished
only
by
act
of
the
sovereign.
against
that
background,
the
first
congress
passed
the
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act,
and
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
its
1974
decision,
the
non-intercourse
act
provision
of
that
statute
simply
codified
what
was
or
came
to
be
the
accepted
principle
that
indian
title
could
be
extinguished
only
with
the
consent
of
the
united
states.
the
non-intercourse
act
provision
must
be
construed,
then,
as
against
that
background,
not
as
creating
a
wholly
new
substantive
area
of
law
or
a
wholly
new
right
of
the
indian
tribes,
but
in
recognizing
pre-existing
rights
and
providing
for
the
further
protection
of
them.
secondly,
it
is
important
to--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
primarily
we
rely
for
that
proposition
on
the
case
johnson
v.
m'intosh.
what
occurred
in
that
case
was
it
was
essentially
a
property
dispute
between
two
non-indian
claimants.
one
of
the
claimants
was
a
successor
in
interest
to
an
indian
tribe.
what
the
court
did
in
that
case
was
look
to
these
principles
of
international
law
to
ascertain,
first
of
all,
what
the
indian
tribes'
right
of
occupancy
were
to
that
land,
and
secondly,
whether
or
not
those
rights
could
be
conveyed
to
the
non-indian
claimant
in
the
suit
without
the
consent
of
the
general
government.
the
court
held
in
that
decision
that
it
could
not.
now,
we
rely
on
those
two
principles
as
forming
the
basic
elements
of
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
in
this
case.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
there
are
no...
there
are
no
suits
arising
at
that
time
by
indian
tribes
asserting
the
precise
cause
of
action
we
have
here,
but
we
think
that
the
principles
in
johnson
v.
m'intosh
clearly
apply
to
this
situation.
were
there
any
spaces
left
in
the
development
of
the
federal
common
law
at
that
time,
we
think
they
were
adequately
filled
by
the
enactment
of
the
1790
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act
which
did,
in
fact,
on
its
face,
purport
to
establish
a
special
protection
for
indian
tribes,
and
did
in
fact
codify
the
principle
that
indian
land
could
not
be
lost
without
the
consent
of
the
federal
government.
we
think
that
clearly
between
the
two,
the
principles
of
johnson
v.
m'intosh,
and
congress
with
subsequent
enactments
of
the
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act,
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
now,
i
will
turn
my
attention
to
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
in
an
effort
to
respond
to
some
of
the
court's
inquiries
in
that
regard.
first
of
all,
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
that
28
u.s.c.
section
2415
certainly
does
apply,
both
with
respect
to
the
monetary
damages
aspect
of
these
claims
and
the
title
aspect.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
your
honor,
by
its
terms
it
does,
but
i
refer
the
court
to
2415
subsection
(a).
the
words
"indian
tribe"
do
not
appear
in
that
subsection,
but
as
justice
o'connor
observed
earlier,
it
is
clear
from
the
language
there
that
congress
intended
there
to
be
a
statute
of
limitations
governing
money
claims
brought
by
tribes
as
well
as
the
united
states.
that
implication
is
clear
from
the
following.
the
statute
first
of
all
sets
up
a
procedure
by
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
ascertain
which
money
damages
claims
should
be
brought
by
the
united
states.
those
lists
are
to
be
published.
a
second
list
is
to
be
published
which
rejects
certain
claims
by
the
secretary
as
unmeritorious.
finally,
subsection
(a)
provides
that
with
respect
to
the
rejected
claims,
the
suit
must
be
brought
within
a
year
thereafter
or
be
forever
barred.
it
is
clear
from
both
the
legislative
history
and
the
statute
framework
itself
that
within
that
year
period
of
time
the
only
suits
that
would
be
filed
would
certainly
not
be
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
but
by
the
tribes
themselves.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
that's
possible.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
that
statutory
language,
however,
is
informed
by
the
legislative
history
which
makes
clear
that
the
one
year
grace
period
was
a
period
provided
for
tribes
themselves
within
which
to
act.
for
instance,
there
is
much
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
of
getting
appropriate
notice
to
the
tribes
involved
so
that
the
tildes
will
know
what
steps
have
been
taken.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
no,
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
between
the
two
it
is
clear
that
in
the
1982
amendment
to
section
2415,
there
is
evidence
that
congress
intended
or
believed
that
the
statute
of
limitations
governing
money
damages
claims
applied
then
as
it
had
applied
for
the
prior
five
amendments
to
that
statute
to
tribal
suits
themselves.
now,
what
we
have,
if
congress
on
the
one
hand
establishes
a
parallel
track
between
the
united
states
and
tribal
claims
on
trespass
damages,
we
then
refer
to
subsection
(c)
which
says
that
no
statute
of
limitations
shall
bar
title
suits
brought
by
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
indian
tribes.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
we
agree,
justice
rehnquist,
it
does
assume
that
the
cause
of
action
existed,
and
we
also
point
to
that
as
some
evidence
that
the
cause
of
action
did
in
fact
exist.
there
are,
however,
prior
acts
of
congress
which
indicate
in
ever
stronger
terms
that
such
causes
of
action
did
exist.
for
instance,
28
u.s.c.
section
1362,
which
in
its
legislative
history
refers
to
a
case
brought
by
a
tribe
which
was
in
fact
an
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act
claim.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
point
to
both
section
1362
and
section
2415
as
not
giving
rise
to
the
cause
of
action
itself
but
simply
evidencing
congress'
assumption
that
the
cause
of
action
existed.
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
both
statutes
is
relevant
for
that
purpose.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
why
i
return
to
the
literal
language
of
section
2415
which
on
its
face,
section
2415,
subsection
(c)
on
its
face
states
that
no
such
claims
brought
by
the
united
states
shall
be--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--that's
true,
your
honor.
it
has
been
accepted
by
all
the
parties
in
this
case,
however,
as
meaning
that
result.
i
think
even
the
petitioners--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
we
accept
that
burden,
your
honor.
we
point
to
the
1982
amendment
of
that
statute,
however,
as
evidence
of
what
congress
thought
it
had
been
doing
all
along
with
the
prior
amendments
of
section
2415.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
the
point
here,
your
honor,
is
that
section
2415...
all
parties
here
essentially
admit
or
acknowledge
that
the
inquiry
here
is
whether
the
congress
has
applied
a
statute,
a
federal
statute
of
limitations.
if
it
has
not,
then
the
petitioners
argue
we
should
look
to
state
law
to
see
what
may
be
an
applicable
state
statute.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
no,
your
honor,
there
are
other
indications
as
well.
even
before
the
1982
amendment
to
section
2415,
it
had
been
construed
by
the
ninth
circuit
to
apply
to
claims
brought
by
tribes
as
well
as
claims
brought
by
the
united
states.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
apart
from
the
merits
of
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis,
however,
we
do
rely
on
the
congress'
interpretation
in
the
1982
amendment
as
some
evidence
of
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
the
earlier
sections
as
well,
so
that
as
of
1970--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--it
can
shed
some
light,
your
honor,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
congress
apparently
in
the
1970,
the
applicable
version
in
1970
of
the
statute
was
assuming
that
such
causes
of
action
existed.
otherwise,
the
need
for
the
statute
would
not
have
arisen.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
congress'
assumption
on
that
point
is
some
evidence
of
what
the
law
in
fact
was.
and
i
think
we
can
also
point
to
similar
statutes
involving
restraints
on
alienation
of
allotted
indian
lands
where
this
court
has
indicated
that
once
congress
ascertains
how
title
is
to
be
extinguished
in
that
respect,
state
law
generally
should
not
apply
to
broaden
the
means
of
extinguishment.
the
cases
such
as
bunch
v.
cole,
in
addition
to
ewert
v.
bluejacket--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--well,
i
am
referring,
your
honor,
to
congress'
having
spoken
as
of
1793.
if
a
cause
of
action
in
fact
arose
under
the
1793
statute,
then
we
think
it
is
appropriate
to
look
at
that
to
determine
what
had
happened
as
of
1970.
if
congress
decided,
determined
that
as
of
1793
indian
title
could
be
extinguished
by
one
means
and
on
means
only,
and
that
is
through
the
consent
of
the
congress,
then
that
could
be
a
sufficient
basis
in
1970
to
determine
that
a
state
law
statute
of
limitations
does
not
apply.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
no,
your
honor,
it
is
done
by
reference
back
to
the
1793
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act
itself.
the
language
of
that
statute
is
pretty
clear
in
that
it
says
that
there
is
one
means,
and
one
means
only,
by
which
indian
title
can
be
extinguished.
so
the
question
now
is
as
of
1970
when
this
suit
is
filed,
has
there...
has
the
congress
acknowledged
another
means,
that
is
by
application
of
a
state
statute
of
limitations.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
not
absolutely
by
its
terms,
your
honor,
but
that
is
a
fair
implication
from
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
well,
in
a
moment,
your
honor,
i
will
address
the
implied
ratification
argument
of
the
petitioners--
[laughter]
but
to
respond
to...
to
respond
further
to
the
argument
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
what
we
think
we
have
here
embodied
in
the
1793
act,
which
is
what
we
rely
on
for
our
cause
of
action,
is
a
strong
policy
statement
by
the
congress
that
indian
title
can
be
acquired
through
only
one
means.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
exactly,
your
honor.
we
rely
on
section
2415--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
rely--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--pardon
me?
i
am
sorry.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true,
but
i
think
what
we
have
got
to
keep
in
mind
here
is
the
body
of
law
on
the
general
issue
that
we
are
dealing
with.
we
are
dealing
with,
as
this
court
observed
in
its
'74
opinion
in
this
case,
a
very
uniquely
federal
interest,
and
that
is
the
preservation
of
indian
land.
it
is
not
the
usual
rule
in
indian
law
that
a
state
statute
of
limitations
or
other
state
defense
will
be
adopted
to
apply
to
bar
indian
property
rights.
it
runs
contrary
to
a
number
of
rules
of
construction
relating
to
the
proper
means
of
construing
treaties,
for
instance,
the
proper
means
for
resolving
ambiguities,
and--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--well,
we
think
those
are
rules
that
would
apply
in
the
first
instance
to
the
indian
trade
and
intercourse
act
of
1793.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
to
determine
by
what
means
indian
title
can
be
extinguished.
and
in
our
view,
the
state
statute
of
limitations
has
not
been
one
that
congress
has
accepted
as
an
appropriate
means
to
extinguish
indian
title,
and
that
is
the
effect
of
the
application
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
what
we
would
have
in
effect
would
be
a
system
that
would
be
virtually
unadministerable
by
the
united
states
if
that
were
the
case.
we
would
have
a
system
where
50
different
statutes
of
limitations
would
apply
to
bar
claims
by
indian
tribes
depending
on
the
happenstance
of
the
location
of
those
lands.
now,
there
are
approximately
300
indian
tribes
in
this
country
with
trust
lands
so
that
each
one
would
have
a
different
federal
interest
in
that
land
defending
on
the
fortuity
of
where
that
land
was
located.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
considerably,
your
honor.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
but
there
is
considerable
variance
among
them,
and
it
is
that
variance
that
the
congress--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true,
but
it
is
also
true--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--it
is
also
true,
your
honor,
that
in
the
unique
context
of
indian
property
rights,
that
where
congress
has
intended
to
apply
a
state
statute
of
limitations,
it
has
generally
done
so
expressly.
in
the
context
of
indian
allotments,
for
instance,
there
are
some
provisions
made
that
were
the
subject,
i
believe,
of
this
court's
opinion
in
united
states
v.
clark,
some
reference
to
them,
where
the
state
jurisdiction
and
in
some
respects
state
law
was
made
applicable
to
the
condemnation
of
indian
allottees.
there
are
other
instances
where
congress,
by
express
provision,
has
applied
state
law
to
govern
either
acquisition
of
or
litigation
relating
to
indian
property
rights.
that
makes
it
all
the
more
significant
that
in
this
respect,
in
the
important
respect
of
tribal
property
rights
and
the
basic
statute
that
protects
those
rights,
congress
has
not
done
so.
in
fact,
when
congress
has
expressly
dealt
with
the
issue
of
statute
of
limitations,
it
has
either
done
so
only
with
respect
to
the
united
states
and
treated
tribes
similarly,
or
been
silent
on
the
matter.
so
that
is
a
strong
indication,
given
the
peculiarity
of
indian
property
rights,
that
state
statutes
of
limitations
do
not
apply.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
there
is...
there
has
been
no
overall
estimate
made
of
that
figure,
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
well,
i
gather
the
petitioners
have.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
your
honor,
there
has
been
some
attention
paid
to
that,
but
i
would
caution
the
court
that
many
of
the
statements
describing
those
consequences
by
the
petitioner
are
both
speculative
and
based
on
hyperbole.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
apart
from
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
oneida
have
split
their
cause
of
action,
there
is
some
question
as
to
the
remaining
100,000
acres,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
your
honor,
subject
to
a
possible
defense
by
the
petitioners
of
having
split
our
cause
of
action.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
that
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
in
dealing
with
the
so-called
consequences
of
this
is
that
the
consequences
are
in
a
real
world
context,
and
they
are
not
in
a
context
of
sheer
speculation.
that
context
includes
a
number
of
congressional
settlements
of
prior
cases,
and
also
congress'
expressed
and
continued
interest
in
oversight
of
these
cases.
now,
the
congress
has
asserted
authority
in
itself,
if
need
be,
to
act
to
resolve
these
problems,
as
has
been
pointed
out
earlier.
congress
has
reserved
that
point
up
to
this
point
with
respect
to
this
claim
because
it
did
not
perceive
that
the
consequences
were
so
severe
as
the
petitioners
have
suggested.
in
fact,
congress
has
the...
many
of
the
members
who
spoke
in
opposition
to
certain
bills
which
would
have
that
effect
have
stated
that
the
general
view
of
congress
is
to
prefer
a
negotiated
settlement
among
the
parties
which
would
resolve
forever
these
claims.
that
is
the
real
world
context
of
these
cases.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
not
quite,
your
honor.
insofar
as
the
context
of
this
case
is
concerned,
we
do
not
believe
that
a
laches
or
any
equity
remedies
or
offsets
are
available.
what
we
have
here
are
counties
who
should
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
state,
who
acquired
most
of
the
land
directly
from
the
state
as
the
original
wrongdoer,
so
that
the
laches
defense
is
not
available.
now,
whether--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--no,
your
honor,
the
primary
reason
the
action
was
filed
as
one
for
damages
is
because
it
was
seen
as
a
test
case
by
the
parties
at
the
time,
to
establish--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--pardon
me?
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
we
did
not
want
to
have
to
face
laches,
this
is
true.
but
the
laches
issue
i
think
is
one
that
is
appropriately
reserved
for
the
appropriate
case,
and
that
is
one
between
an
indian
tribal
claimant
and
true
private
individuals
who
assert
good
faith
occupancy
of
the
land.
the
counties
in
this
case
are
neither
private
individuals
nor
can
they
assert
good
faith
occupancy
of
the
land.
in
fact,
their
occupancy
has...
the
good
faith
of
the
their
occupancy
is
the
one
issue
that
remains
yet
for
determination
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
we
don't
purport
to
on
that
basis
only,
your
honor.
if
the
court
will
examine
the
trial
record
in
this
case,
you
will
find
that
there
was
extensive
testimony
given
in
the
original
trial
on
liability
as
to
what
steps
the
oneidas
had
taken
during
the
so-called
195
years,
or
75
i
think
is
the
phrase
that
the
petitioners
used...
to
reach
a
resolution
of
these
claims.
there
is
a
clear
record
of
continued
activity
on
the
part
of
the
oneidas
to
take
whatever
steps
were
available
to
them
at
the
time
to
resolve
this
matter.
there
was
no
evidence
offered
to
refute
any
of
that
evidence
at
the
trial
of
liability.
so
to
that
extent,
our
evidence
on
laches,
if
we
should
reach
that
point,
stands
unrefuted
by
the
petitioners.
and
in
fact,
the
district
court
held,
based
on
that
evidence,
that
laches
could
not
apply
because
the
oneidas
for
variety
of
reasons
were
subject
to
a
number
of
circumstances
that
precluded
them
from
actually
proceeding
with
the
lawsuit
itself,
although
they
had
taken
other
steps.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
with
respect
to
this
case,
we
are
180
degrees
apart.
with
respect
to
any
future
litigation
that
may
arise
as
between
oneida
parties
or
any
other
tribal
claimant
and
private
defendants,
that
is
an
issue
that
is
yet
unresolved.
it
may
be
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
under
those
circumstances
to
look
to
equity
factors.
in
fact,
we
believe
the
court
did
that--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--i
think
the
court
can,
your
honor.
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
of
course,
we
no
longer
honor
that
distinction,
and
because
this
is
a
peculiar
case
where
the
remedy
is
generally
shaped
by
developing
federal
common
law,
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
look
to
equity
factors.
and
in
fact,
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
the
district
court
in
this
case
held
erroneously,
we
argued
in
the
second
circuit,
but
unsuccessfully,
that
the
counties
here
did
occupy
the
land
in
good
faith,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
awarded
the
counties
an
offset
against
the
trespass
damages
for
their
good
faith
occupancy.
so
to
that
extent,
this
very
judgment
that
is
before
the
court
takes
those
equity
considerations
into
account.
now,
as
to
what
these
equity
considerations
may
mean
in
future
litigation
between
different
parties
is
an
issue
that
is
really
not
before
the
court
in
this
context.
if
i
may
in
my
few
remaining
moments,
i
would
like
to
address
the
petitioner's
argument
of
implied
ratification.
here
we
really
are
dealing
with
an
issue
of
double
implication,
if
anything.
we
must
begin
with
some
determination
as
to
the
appropriate
standard
to
be
applied
in
ascertaining
whether
or
not
a
particular
act
extinguished
indian
title.
this
court
in
united
states
v.
santa
fe
railroad
laid
down
the
appropriate
rule,
in
our
opinion.
that
rule
is
that
indian
title
can
be
extinguished
only
by
the
plain
and
unambiguous
act
of
congress.
even
the
petitioners
do
not
assert
that
the
facts
they
rely
on
constitute
plain
and
unambiguous
ratification
of
the
1795
transaction.
so
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
petitioners
are
correct
as
to
the
proper
standard
to
apply,
they
still
have
not
met
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
regard.
even
if
we
apply
the
so-called
explicit
ratification,
explicit
acknowledgement
and
implicit
ratification
standard
that
the
petitioners
seek,
we
find
their
evidence
lacking.
essentially,
what
happened
is
this.
in
1798
another
transaction
occurred
between
the
oneida
nation
and
the
state
of
new
york.
as
part
of
that
transaction,
governor
jay
did
request
and
did
receive
the
presence
and
approval
of
a
federal
commission.
that
transaction
was
then
submitted
to
the
united
states
senate
for
its
formal
ratification,
and
by
two-thirds
vote
that
document
was
ratified.
the
document
was
then
published
by
the
president
as
a
binding
treaty.
that
is
what
ratification
means.
that
is
not
what
occurred
in
1795.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
i
see
that
i
am,
your
honor.
thank
you.
