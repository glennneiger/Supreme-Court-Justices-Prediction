justice
white
put
you've
only
got
limited
time.
justice
white
well,
the
lawyer
for
the
united
states
doesn't
deal
with
it.
justice
white
so
your
"whatsoever"
is
a
little
strong,
isn't
it?
justice
white
except
to
conclude
that
if
the
united
states
isn't
barred,
neither
are
the
indians.
justice
white
what
would
happen
if
the
united
states
were
bringing
this
action
and
it
was
an
action
for
quiet
title?
would
there
be
any
statute
of
limitations?
justice
white
well,
that
would...
that's
just
under
the
section.
that's
just
under
the
statute,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
isn't
that
conclusion
compelled
by
the
statute
or
not,
no
statute
of
limitations?
justice
white
2415.
justice
white
yes.
when
does
the
time
run
out?
justice
white
uh-huh.
justice
white
most
of
which
is
in
private
ownership.
justice
white
so
it
would
be
valued
like
if
you
were
condemning
the
land
or
something.
justice
white
how
do
you
think
it
could
be
cured
by
congress
without
paying
out
a
lot
of
money?
justice
white
well,
some
money,
or
at
least
as
much
as
what
is
involved
in
these
suits.
justice
white
do
you
think
it
would?
justice
white
without
paying
money?
justice
white
the
judgment
of
the
court
says
the
indians
own
the
land
and
the
congress
says,
sorry,
but
we
don't
care
what
a
court
says,
you
don't
own
it.
justice
white
that
sounds
very
logical,
in
other
words,
sensible.
justice
white
tactical
reasons
that
they
would
have
ratified
or
something?
justice
white
to
bring
this
suit.
justice
white
they
agree
with
you
on
the
merits.
justice
white
but
isn't
there
a...
isn't
there
a
state
ground
for
their
being
immune,
too,
or
not?
justice
white
you
mean
there
isn't
one
they
now
claim
anyway.
justice
white
you
mean
if
you
lose
this
case
on
the
merits,
you
couldn't
bring
an
independent
suit
in
the
state
court
for...
against
the
state?
justice
white
but
what
would
be
the
defense'?
justice
white
well
that's
what
i
was
asking
you
before.
isn't
there
some
sensible
state
ground
for
the
state
to
escape
the
reach
of
your
action?
justice
white
well,
you
say
it
doesn't
help
the
county,
but
does
it
help
you?
justice
white
well,
that...
better--
justice
white
--that's
the
bottom
line.
justice
white
did
you
raise
some
state
law
defense
to
state
liability
in
this?
justice
white
did
you
raise
any
state
grounds
for
being
immune
from
liability
over
it?
justice
white
well,
this
is--
justice
white
--the
county
has
claimed
over
against
the
state
in
this
case.
justice
white
and
did
you
assert
any
defense
to
that
claim
over
based
on
the
state
law,
did
you
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
did
you
or
not?
that's
a
yes
or
no.
justice
white
what
did
you
raise,
what
did
you
raise
in
the
trial
court?
what
was
your
pleadings?
justice
white
on
eleventh
amendment
grounds,
but
on
state
ground,
too?
justice
white
i
would
think
if
you
had
claimed
the
state
ground,
that
federal...
the
court
would
have
decided
the
case
on...
never
would
have
needed
to
reach
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
white
well,
what--
justice
white
--what
business
would
we
have
reaching
the
eleventh,
a
federal
constitutional
issue
if
the
case
could
go
off
on
a
state
ground?
justice
white
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general
doesn't
make
the
law,
does
it?
justice
white
i
know
that...
i
know
some
attorneys
general
would
like
it
that
way.
justice
white
well,
they
could
just
have...
could
just
honestly
have
disagreed
with
the
attorney
general.
they
weren't
ignorant
at
all.
they
might
have
said
we
have
the
better
view
of
the
law.
justice
white
well,
he
may
have
thought
it
was
a
frivolous
fight.
justice
white
--go
ahead.
justice
white
go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
justice
white
yes,
but
you
don't
need
section
2415
or
anything
else
then.
you
just
need
the
trade
and
intercourse
act.
justice
white
unless
congress
says
something
besides
the
trade
and
intercourse
act,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations,
there
just
isn't
any.
justice
white
but
there
is
still...
at
least
there
is
the
remainder
of
the
100,000
acres,
isn't
there?
justice
white
you
say
there
is
some
question...
you
say
the
claim
could
be
made
about
the
rest
of
the
100,000
acres.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
there
would
be
an
argument
about
any
other,
any
other
land
that
allegedly
was
acquired
contrary
to
the
trade
and
intercourse
act.
justice
white
well,
congress
had
to
get
around
telling
the
department
of
interior
to
get
with
it,
didn't
they?
justice
white
when
were
they
first
permitted
to
do
so?
justice
white
how
long?
justice
white
tribes?
justice
white
that's
what
we
are
asking
about,
tribes.
justice
white
well,
sometimes
they
think
the
guarding
should
be
bringing
the
action.
justice
white
provided
there
is
a
guardian.
justice
white
is
it
a
congressman
or
the
committee
report
or
who?
who
were
you
quoting?
justice
white
no,
i
didn't...
i
wasn't
raising
a
question
about
it.
i
was
just
raising
a
question
of
whether
it
ever
would.
justice
white
could
the
secretary
ratify
it?
