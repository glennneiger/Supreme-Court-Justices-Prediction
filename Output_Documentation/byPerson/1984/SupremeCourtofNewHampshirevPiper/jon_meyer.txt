mr.
jon
meyer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
our
position
under
the
standards
of
review
developed
by
this
court
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
4
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
new
hampshire
to
establish
that
out
of
state
attorneys
admitted
to
the
new
hampshire
bar
would
be
the
peculiar
source
of
a
substantial
problem
relating
to
legal
practice,
and
furthermore,
that
the
particular
terms
of
the
new
hampshire
residency
requirement
are
closely
related
to
remedying
the
problem
stated.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
i
think
under...
although
i
don't
think
the
court's
jurisprudence
is
that
clear
in
allocating
the
burden
of
proof,
it
is
my
understanding
of
hicklin
and
toomer
and
the
other
cases
interpreting
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
in
article
4,
and
it
is
that
we
rely
upon
rather
than
the
same
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
once
the
applicant
establishes
that
the
measure
is
discriminatory
against
out
of
staters,
and
this
measure
is
discriminatory
on
its
face,
that
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
state
to
establish,
as
hicklin
put
it,
that
the
out
of
staters
are
the
peculiar
source
of
a
substantial
problem,
and
that
the
particular
measure
is
closely
related
to
remedying
the
problem
stated.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
i
think
that
camden
is
significant
because
it
restated
the
case.
the
precise
language
this
court
has
used
in
developing
the
test
has
varied
slightly
from
case
to
case.
i
think
camden
is
significant
because
it
restates
that
test,
and
restates
it,
i
believe,
precisely
in
the
terms
i
use,
peculiar
source
of
a
substantial
problem,
and
that
it
be
closely
related.
and
i
think
camden
is
also
a
significant
case
because
in
that...
again
in
that
case
the
city
had
some
fairly
strong
claims
to
be
exempt
from
the
clause's
coverage
altogether,
insofar
as
the
measure
only
applied
to
public
employees.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
that
the
clause
applied,
and
i
think
that
shows
an
intention
to
give
article
4
a
broad
reading,
which
we
believe
is
consonant
with
the
values
that
are
protected
by
it.
what
i
would
like
to
do
in
the
time
allotted
is
respond
to
new
hampshire's
contentions
that
it
should
have...
in
effect,
the
rule
should
be
examined
under
a
lesser
standard
of
review
or
no
standard
at
all,
and
then
to
look
at
the
new
hampshire
justifications
in
the
context
of
the
standard
that
this
court
has
set
forth.
mr.
jon
meyer
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
and
i
want
to
clearly
distinguish
the
challenge
raised
in
this
case
from
the
challenge,
for
example,
raised
in
the
case
of
leis
v.
flynt,
where
the
lawyer
in
fact
coming
from
out
of
state
said
he
had
a
right
under
due
process
to
practice
without
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
state.
we
acknowledge
the
right
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
to
establish
admission
standards.
our
position
is,
though,
that
those
standards
cannot
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
applicants.
mr.
jon
meyer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
meyer
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
there
is
no--
mr.
jon
meyer
--your
honor,
we
don't
think...
yes,
i
would
like
to
clarify
our
position.
we
think
that
the
requirement
of
a
bar
examination
is
a
reasonable
and
legitimate
requirement,
but
if
the
state
conditions
it
upon
meeting
a
residency
test,
then
we
think
the
residency
condition
is
not
permissible.
we
think
the
requirement
of
the
test
is
permissible--
mr.
jon
meyer
--no,
your
honor,
we
think
the
state
of
new
hampshire
can
require
you
to
come
to
concord
to
take
the
bar
exam.
we
also
think--
mr.
jon
meyer
--your
honor,
the
difference,
and
my
client
had
no
objection
to
actually
going
to
new
hampshire
to
take
the
bar
exam.
the
difference
is,
the
state's
residency
requirement,
as
stated
by
my
brother,
requires
you
to
establish
your
principal
place
of
physical
domicile
in
state
and
intend
to
do
that
for
the
indefinite
future.
obviously,
there
would
be
no
problem
with
my
client
going
over
the
border,
but
she
did
not
feel
as
a
matter
of
honesty
that
she
could
say
that
she
was
intending
to
stay
there
in
the
indefinite
future
when
in
fact
she
wanted...
her
intention
was
to
reside
with
her
family
in
vermont.
i
would
like
to
just
briefly--
mr.
jon
meyer
--yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
an
office
requirement
would
be...
i
mean,
that
is
a
different...
again,
the
constitutionality
of
that
requirement
is
a
different
question.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
i
think
satisfaction
with
that
response
would
be
an
overstatement.
i
think
that
ruling
would--
mr.
jon
meyer
--well,
your
honor,
my
client--
mr.
jon
meyer
--your
honor,
i
did
want
to
make
that
distinction.
i
think
that
the
principal
office
requirement
would
raise
some
significant
problems
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
in
terms
of
my
client,
if
there
had
been
an
office
requirement,
this
case
never
would
have
been
brought.
and
i
would
like
to,
in
response
to
your
earlier
question,
in
terms
of
what
was
her
intention
and
what
is
in
the
record,
in
the
letter
that
she
sent
requesting
exempting
to
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court--
mr.
jon
meyer
--no,
it
is
contained
on
pages
12
to
14
of
the
appendix.
she
stated
in
there
that
she
wanted
to
practice
in
new
hampshire
to
avoid
conflicts
with
her
husband,
and
she
also
stated,
"i
am
interested
in
admission
to
the
new
hampshire
bar
exam
inasmuch
as
i
have
a
possible
job
with
attorney
panccast
in
littleton,
new
hampshire.
"
mr.
jon
meyer
so
that
is
the
only
information
that
i
am
aware
of
in
the
record
with
respect
to
her
intention
after
admission.
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
jon
meyer
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
we
concede
that.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
requirement,
i
think,
there
has
to
be
concern
as
to
whether
the
class
encompassed
is
substantially
overbroad
beyond
the
particular
problem
that
is
designated.
there
has
to
be
some,
i
think,
connection,
and
this
court
would
say
close
connection,
between
the
class
actually
negatively
affected
by
the
discrimination
as
opposed
to
the
class
raising
what
the
state
alleges
to
be
the
peculiar
and
substantial
problem.
i
would
like
to
briefly
respond
to
this
question
of
the
lack
of
a
residence
requirement
after
admission.
there
is
no
information
either
in
the
record
or
to
my
knowledge
anywhere
else
as
to
how
many
new
hampshire
attorneys
actually
reside
out
of
state.
i
think
it
is
instructive
in
itself
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
has
never
seen
fit
to
collect
this
information.
the
only
information
we
have
is
how
many
attorneys
had
a
principal
office
address
outside
of
new
hampshire,
and
that
number
in
1982
was
269.
but
we
think
that
that
substantially--
mr.
jon
meyer
--out
of,
in
1980,
it
was
1,987...
in
1982.
we
think,
though,
that
that
total
substantially
undercounts
the
number
actually
out
of
state.
we
think
there
is
likely
to
be
a
significant
class
of
people
who
practice
in
new
hampshire,
as
my
client
desired
to
do,
who
actually
live
outside
of
the
state.
but
i
think
the
principal
fallacy
as
we
see
it
in
new
hampshire's
argument
on
these
statistics
is,
they
say,
well,
most
new
hampshire
attorneys
live
in
state,
and
we
concede
that
that
is
probably
true,
and
they
therefore
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
the
reason
they
live
in
state
is
because
of
the
residency
requirement.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
the
only
information
contained
in
the
record
is
what
i
cited
before,
her
statement
to
the
supreme
court
that
she
had
a
possible
job
offer
in
littleton,
that
she
wanted
to
practice
in
new
hampshire
to
avoid
conflicts
with
her
husband,
practicing
in
vermont.
but
again,
we
think
that
the
claim
that
because
most
people
live
in
new
hampshire,
the
residency
requirement
has
been
effective
is
fallacious,
because
although
i
may
be
prejudiced,
we
believe
that
the
reason
most
people
live
in
new
hampshire,
most
attorneys,
is
not
because
of
the
residency
requirement,
but
because
new
hampshire
is
a
nice
state
to
live
in,
and
because
if
you
happen
to
practice
in
new
hampshire,
it
is
a
convenient
state
to
live
in.
so,
we
think
residency
requirement
or
no
residency
requirement,
the
likelihood
is
that
the
majority
of
new
hampshire
practitioners
are
going
to
continue
to
live
in
new
hampshire.
now,
the
significance
of
a
lack
of
after
admission
residency
requirement
is,
number
one,
that
it
suggests
that
the
particular
requirement
is
really
not
closely
tailored
to
the
problem
stated,
but
more
importantly,
it
suggests
that
the
problems
alluded
to
really
are
lacking
in
significance.
if
in
fact
lawyers
residing
out
of
state
but
admitted
to
the
new
hampshire
bar
pose
such
a
substantial
problem,
then
why
has
new
hampshire
not
even
made
any
effort
to
count
how
many
there
are?
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
our
response
to
that
is,
number
one,
that
he
doesn't
know--
mr.
jon
meyer
--no,
because
no
statistics,
no
count
has
ever
been
made
as
to
where
new
hampshire
attorneys
live.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
a
proper
case,
because
i
think
that
the
district
court
had
to
rely
on
the
information
presented
to
it.
there
was
no
contest
in
terms
of
the
evidence
that
was
presented.
and
that
the...
in
terms
of
this
court's--
mr.
jon
meyer
--but,
your
honor,
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
district
court
to
reach
that
issue,
because
even
if
the
new
hampshire
residency
requirement
has
been
successful
in
ensuring
that
most
new
hampshire
attorneys
live
in
new
hampshire,
we
don't
think
that
that
is
an
adequate
justification.
we
think
that
then
it
comes
to
the
specific
justifications
provided
by
the
state,
and
the
principal
one
they
are
relying
upon
is
saying,
well,
it
is
important
that
new
hampshire
attorneys
live
in
new
hampshire
in
order
to
be
available
for
public
service
and
pro
bono
assignments
from
the
court.
we
don't
question
that
that
is
an
important
interest.
however,
we
think
it
is
paradoxical
to
say
that,
in
terms
of
the
interests
of
the
clients,
that
by
admitting
more
attorneys,
you
are
going
to
have
a
problem
with
pro
bono
work.
we
believe,
if
anything,
it
is
the
opposite,
that
by
permitting
previously
excluded
attorneys,
there
are
going
to
be
more
attorneys
available.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
assuming
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
has
a
right
to
make
involuntary
appointments,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
should
be
limited
by
the
geographical
location
of
the
individual.
if
the
individual
applies
to
the
new
hampshire
bar,
which
is
an
integrated
bar,
and
joins
that
bar,
then
it
is
our
position
that
he
or
she
are
subject
to
the
exact
same
obligations
as
attorneys
who
reside
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
i
think
it
depends
not
so
much
on
where
they
live.
it
depends
on
where
they
have
a
law
office.
presuming
they...
well,
if
they
want
to
join
the
new
hampshire
bar
in
the
first
place,
the
likelihood
is
not
that
they
are
going
to
live
in
california.
the
likelihood
is
that
they
are
going
to
live
in
massachusetts.
in
any
event,
if
they
are
going
to
practice
in
new
hampshire,
and
getting
admitted
to
the
bar
involves
a
substantial
commitment
in
time
and
resources,
so
one
would
presume
that
they
intend
to
practice
in
new
hampshire,
and
if
they
are
available
to
practice
in
new
hampshire,
then
they
should
also
be
available
to
take
criminal
or
other
types
of
work.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
i
think
that
goes
another
justification
asserted
by
new
hampshire,
and
that
is
availability
for
court
appearances
and
for
disciplinary
hearings.
and
it
is
our
position
that
new
hampshire
already
has
adequate
assurances
of
availability
in
terms
of
the
long
arm
jurisdiction,
and
also
the
supreme
court,
state
supreme
court
disciplinary
rule
making
you
subject
to
the
court's
jurisdiction
by
becoming
a
member
of
the
bar.
mr.
jon
meyer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
meyer
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
phone
system...
i
mean,
communication
is
obviously
possible
on
an
immediate
basis
in
any
event,
but
i
don't
think
that
an
attorney
can
say
to
the
court,
you
have
to
hold
off
the
hearing
because
it
is
going
to
take
us
three
days
to
get
to
new
hampshire.
i
think
that
clients
in
making
their
choice
of
attorney
can
look
to
that
factor,
and
i
think
an
attorney
representing
a
client
involved
in
those
sort
of
proceedings
is
presumably
going
to
want
to
have
an
office
in
new
hampshire,
or
are
going
to
want
to
have
a
relationship
with
somebody
who
has
an
office
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
jon
meyer
well,
your
honor,
two
responses.
first,
i
don't
believe
that
new
hampshire
judges
would
be
sympathetic
to
that
contention.
but
secondly,
i
think
the
likelihood
is
in
terms
of
most
out
of
state
attorneys
who
want
to
practice
in
new
hampshire
is,
they
are
not
going
to
come
from
california.
they
are
going
to
come
from
massachusetts,
from
vermont,
and
from
maine.
those
are
the
people
who
want
to
get
into
the
new
hampshire
bar,
not
people--
mr.
jon
meyer
--your
honor,
it
is
conceivable
certainly
that
somebody
from
california
would
join
the
new
hampshire
bar,
but
we
don't
think
that
that
person,
because
he
resides
in
california,
can
use
that
fact
as
an
excuse
for
not
being
available
for
court
appearances.
but
the
other
point
is
that
what
really
in
our
mind
is
critical
in
terms
of
where
an
attorneys'
availability
is
not
where
he
lives,
but
where
he
practices
law,
and
if
he
lives
in
california
and
practices
law
in
new
hampshire,
we
think
he
will
be
available
in
new
hampshire.
if
he
lives
in
new
hampshire
and
practices
law
in
california,
he
is
not
likely
to
be
available
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
more
defensible
than
the
new
hampshire
rule,
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
survive--
mr.
jon
meyer
--i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
again,
i
don't
think
the
justifications
that
can
be
offered
for
that
sort
of
rule,
and
it
would
depend
on
specifics,
can
meet
the
demanding
standard
that
this
court
has
set
up
under
hicklin.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
it
is
my
interpretation
of
martinez
v.
bynam
that
that
sort
of
requirement
would
survive,
and
i
think
there
is
an
important
difference.
mr.
jon
meyer
because
that
involves
a
state's
use
of
its
own
very
scarce
financial
resources,
and
i
think
the
state
has
a...
and
what
this
court
has
seen
to
be
a
compelling
interest
in
providing
that
residents
who
through
their
own
tax
expenditures
help
fund
this
public
university
have
first
shot
at
attendance
there.
so,
i
think
that
that
really
involves
a
legitimately
substantial
and
important
interest,
and
i
think
the
difference
with
this
case
is
that
new
hampshire
really
is
not
ultimately
able
to
establish
that
where
you
live
makes
much
difference
in
terms
of
your
ability
to
meet
all
the
requirements
and
obligations
of
the
new
hampshire
bar.
mr.
jon
meyer
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
missed
the
last
part.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
are
not
relying
upon
discriminatory
intent,
and
we
don't
think
we
have
to.
under
this
court's
rulings,
particularly
in
the
commerce
area,
the
discriminatory
effect,
if
substantial,
is
sufficient,
and
that
is
the
basis
of
our
claim
here,
not
the
intention
or
lack
of
intention
of
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
mr.
jon
meyer
no,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
i
did
want
to
briefly
address
the
griffiths
case,
because
i
think
in
many
ways
that
is
the
closest
case
to
this
one,
and
new
hampshire
has
attempted
to
distinguish
it,
saying
that
it
really...
issues
there
involve
the
lawyer
as
a
quasi-public
officer,
and
this
is
different.
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
position
of
the
state
of
connecticut
in
the
griffiths
case,
and
in
particular
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
they
basically
rely
upon
many
of
the
same
powers,
in
fact,
all
the
same
powers
of
attorneys,
and
the
same
functions
of
attorneys
as
is
relied
upon
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire
in
this
case.
and
the
significance
of
griffiths
is
not
its
holding,
because
that
involves
a
different
standard
of...
a
different
constitutional
provision.
the
significance
of
griffiths
in
our
eyes
is
that
the
court
rejected
the
claim,
number
one,
that
because
their
attorneys
should
be
immune
from
constitutional
review,
and
number
two,
that
a
different
constitutional
standard
should
be
applied.
i
think
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
the
importance
of
regulation
of
the
legal
profession,
and
the
special
interests
that
courts
have
in
this
area,
but
this
court
has
also
consistently
recognized
that
that
discretion
and
that
special
interest
is
never
sufficient
ground
for
violating
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
and
that
the
four
state
supreme
courts
which
have
considered
in
adversarial
fashion
whether
a
state
residency
requirement
violates
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
have
all
found
that
it
does.
and
we
think
that
indicates
at
least
for
those
courts
that
they
do
not
see
the
imposition
of
federal
constitutional
values
to
the
state
courts
as
being
an
undue
federal
imposition.
mr.
jon
meyer
yes,
your
honor,
but
they
have
not
taken
the
position
new
hampshire
has,
that
simply
imposing...
that
the
new
hampshire...
that
the
state...
the
federal...
new
hampshire's
position
is
in
fact
that
the
federal
standard
shouldn't
apply,
and
the
state
courts
that
have
looked
at
this,
and
i
am
referring
to
massachusetts,
new
jersey...
new
york,
west
virginia,
and
alaska,
have
all
said
that
this
court's
standards
in
hicklin
should
apply,
even
in
the
area
of
state
regulation
of
the
bar.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
among
all
the
privileges
and
immunities,
the
most
fundamental
and
the
most
central
really
relate
to
occupations,
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
anomalous
should
an
exception
be
made
or
should
a
lower
standard
of
review
be
applied
in
this
area.
the
justification
in
addition
to
the
others
that
is
relied
upon
by
new
hampshire
is
knowledge
of
local
rules,
but
we
think
they
have
entirely
failed
to
demonstrate
that
this...
out
of
state
attorneys
are
in
any
way
peculiarly
deficient
in
this
area.
all
applicants
to
the
new
hampshire
bar
must
take
and
pass
an
examination
on
new
hampshire
law.
they
must
also
take
a
practical
skills
course
after
admission.
finally,
under
the
new
hampshire
code
of
professional
responsibility,
they
are
all
obligated
to
maintain
and
improve
their
knowledge
of
the
law.
mr.
jon
meyer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
they
are
generally
sent
to
us
by
mail.
mr.
jon
meyer
yes.
mr.
jon
meyer
well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
services.
you
can
get
in
effect
the
same
week
service,
or
you
can
get
a
same
month
service.
mr.
jon
meyer
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
manchester
it
is
very
difficult
to
rely
upon
what
you
read
in
the
newspapers.

[generallaughter.]
mr.
jon
meyer
your
honor,
there
are
frequently
accounts
of
decisions
in
the
new
hampshire
newspapers,
but
i
don't
think
that
they
are
a
reliable
or
necessary
means
of
getting
that
information,
and
that
if
you
as
an
attorney
feel--
mr.
jon
meyer
--well,
not,
your
honor,
if
you
decide
to
subscribe
to
the
more
advanced
slip
sheet
service.
you
receive
it
at
approximately
the
same
time
the
newspapers
would.
mr.
jon
meyer
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
but
if...
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
believe
there
are
adequately
in
place
adequate
protections
of
attorney
knowledge
of
local
rules
and
procedures,
and
in
fact
lawyers
are
tested
on
it,
but
if
they
are
not
sufficient,
then
the
state
has
open
to
it
numerous
other
means
of
assuring
that
knowledge.
for
example,
requiring
continuing
legal
education.
for
example,
requiring
a
linkage
between
less
and
more
experienced
attorneys.
and
we
think
that
the
need
to
exclude
all
out
of
staters
is
both
unconnected
and
too
broad.
now,
there
is
also
a
concern,
a
justification
raised
about
concern
about
your
reputation
in
the
legal
community.
but
we
think
that
what
counts
is
not
the
legal
community...
is
not
the
community
you
live
in,
but
the
legal
community
you
practice
in.
and
if
an
attorney
practices
in
new
hampshire,
that
should
be
more
than
adequate
assurance
that
he
is
concerned
about
his
reputation
in
the
state.
and
if
he
doesn't
practice
in
new
hampshire,
you
don't
really
care.
but
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
for
lawyers
who
practice
in
more
than
one
jurisdiction,
under
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
rules
there
is
a
requirement
that
anybody
suspended
or
disbarred,
that
that
be
sent
to
all
of
the
jurisdictions
where
the
attorney
practices.
so
that
would
surely
provide,
in
our
opinion,
a
substantial
incentive
for
any
attorney
to
conform
to
the
opinions
of
his
new
hampshire
peers.
thank
you,
your
honors.
