mr.
gross,
i
suppose
states
vary
on
this,
don't
they?
justice
blackmun
as
i
understand,
in
virginia,
for
instance,
the
commonwealth
insists
that
an
attorney...
that
residency
is
not
enough.
he
has
to
have
an
office
in
the
state.
now,
at
least
new
hampshire
doesn't
go
that
far.
justice
blackmun
suppose
mrs.
piper
here,
living,
as
she
did,
just
across
the
border
in
vermont,
maintained
or
joined
a
law
firm
that
had
an
office
in
new
hampshire.
still
not
eligible?
justice
blackmun
suppose
it
is
in
my
example,
it
was
a
primary
office.
justice
blackmun
suppose
it
was
the
only
place.
she
was
offered
a
partnership
in
a
new
hampshire
firm,
but
lived
across
the
line
in
vermont,
just
commuted.
like
a
lot
of
areas
in
the
country,
you
commute
across
state
lines
to
do
the
only
law
practice
you
do.
justice
blackmun
you
must,
mr.
gross,
you
must
have
attorneys
admitted
to
the
new
hampshire
bar
that
go
to
boston
and
come
up
and
try
cases
in
new
hampshire.
justice
blackmun
but
you
are
not
concerned
with
that.
justice
blackmun
this
is
the
weak
spot
in
your
case,
if
there
is
any.
justice
blackmun
i
suppose
that
is
true
of
any
state,
really.
