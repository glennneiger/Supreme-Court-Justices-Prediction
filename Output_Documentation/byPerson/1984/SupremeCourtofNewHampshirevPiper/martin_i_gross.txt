mr.
martin
i.
gross
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
a
recent
swearing
in
ceremony,
in
several,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
has
admonished
new
admittees
that
in
the
court's
view
new
hampshire
lawyers
should
not
just
be
merchants
of
law,
but
instead
should
be
servants
of
justice.
the
residency
requirement
involved
in
this
case
is
one
of
the
ways
the
new
hampshire
court
has
chosen
to
reinforce
the
court's
aspirations
for
new
hampshire
lawyers
as
part
of
a
system
for
administering
justice
in
the
state.
the
new
hampshire
court
has
concluded
that
requiring
residency
at
the
time
of
admission
assists
in
assuring
that
new
hampshire
lawyers
will
be
available
to
perform
obligations
that
the
court
has
imposed
on
lawyers
in
the
course
of
defining
the
nature
and
characteristics
of
the
proper
practice
of
law
in
the
state.
at
stake
in
this
case,
we
submit,
is
whether
the
new
hampshire
court
can
continue
to
reinforce
its
aspirations
for
new
hampshire
lawyers
through
use
of
a
simple
residency
requirement
that
new
hampshire
lawyers
be
residents
of
new
hampshire
at
the
time
they
take
the
oath
of
admission.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
we
suggest
not,
having
acted
in
good
faith
with
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
requires
residency
at
the
time
of
administering
the
oath,
and
in
order
to
become
a
resident,
one
has
to
undertake
to
the
court
that
one
has
become
a
resident
with
the
indefinite
intention
of
remaining.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
yes,
and
that,
of
course...
therein
lies
one
of
the
great
challenges
of
our
brethren
in
this
case,
because
they
seem
to
say
that
because
new
hampshire
does
not
revoke
licenses
if
someone
moves
away,
that
somehow
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
requirement.
if
i
may
just
express
to
the
court
what
the
new
hampshire
court's
reasons
are
for
that
requirement,
then
i
would
like
to
address
why
the
revocation
argument
doesn't
hold
any
water.
i
think
the
facts
bearing
on
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court's
reasons
are
extremely
important.
we
have
no
need
to
guess
in
this
case.
those
reasons
are
embodied
in
an
affidavit
of
new
hampshire
chief
justice
king.
those
reasons
appear
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
32,
and
the
case
comes
here
on
summary
judgment.
there
are
no
findings
contrary
to
justice
king's
affidavit,
and
on
this
record
i
don't
think
there
is
any
room
to
doubt
that
justice
king
accurately
states
what
the
new
hampshire
court
is
doing
with
the
residency
requirement.
and
what
it
is
doing
is
as
follows.
as
the
affidavit
recites,
the
new
hampshire
court
regards
residency
as
establishing
new
hampshire
as
the
principal
place
of
physical
residence
for
the
indefinite
future.
so
residency
at
the
time
of
admission
is
the
new
hampshire
court's
chosen
proxy
for
promoting
sustained
physical
presence
in
the
new
hampshire
community.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
yes,
precisely.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
either
one
will
do.
and
the
only
time
that
one
has
to
become
a
resident
is
at
the
moment
before
the
oath
of
admission
is
administered.
that
is
the
time
that
the
admission
requirement
bites.
and
it
is
at
that
time
that
we
say
that
it
has
proven
effective
to
accomplish
the
goals
that
the
new
hampshire
court
wishes
to
carry
out.
why
is
it
important--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--oh,
they
care.
oh,
yes,
indeed,
they
care.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
well,
so
far
they
haven't
done
anything.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
oh,
yes--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--moments,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--no,
it
is
not.
i
don't
believe
that's
the
new
hampshire
court's
position.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
excuse
me?
mr.
martin
i.
gross
well,
i
suppose
that
you
could
chase
them,
if
that
were
you--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--let
me
just
simply
say
that
the
new
hampshire
court
doesn't,
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
is
that
it
has
found,
and
i
think
the
facts
in
this
case
demonstrate
that
it
need
not
in
order
to
accomplish
what
it
is
trying
to
do
in
requiring
the
requirement
in
the
first
place.
referring
to
justice
king's
affidavit,
we
invite
the
court's
particular
attention
to
the
reasons
in
paragraph
9,
and
i
might
say
this
is
an
important
statement
of
reasons
because
it
was
totally
overlooked
or
disregarded
by
the
lower
courts.
it
is
possibly
most
important
in
the
terms
of
the
new
hampshire
court's
high
aspirations
for
the
new
hampshire
bar
that
the
new
hampshire
lawyers
not
just
be
merchants
of
the
law,
but
be
servants
of
justice.
in
the
new
hampshire
court's
view,
the
residency
requirement
supports
availability
of
lawyers
for
the
extra
activities
the
new
hampshire
court
expects
of
them
above
and
beyond
basic
concerns
for
competence
and
ethical
conduct.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
yes,
they
do.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
no,
and
i
might
observe,
your
honor,
that
new
hampshire
does
not
go
as
far
as
some
states
do
in
requiring
residence
at
some
point
prior
to
the
admission
of
the
oath.
there
are
several
states
that
require
residence.
and
i
believe
virginia
may
be
one
of
them
that
require
residence
at
the
point
of
actually
taking
the
bar
examination,
or
at
the
point
of
applying
for
admission
to
the
bar,
and
those
are
far
more
rigorous
requirements
than
new
hampshire's,
which
is
a
simple
requirement.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
no,
that
would
not
be
sufficient,
and
the
reason
it
wouldn't
be
sufficient
is
because
in
order
to
achieve
the
new
hampshire
court's
purpose
of
sustained
physical
presence
in
order
to
provide
availability
for
these
tasks
that
the
court
wants
lawyers
to
perform
over
and
above
basic
competence
and
ethical
conduct,
the
requirement
of
an
office
doesn't
seem
to
work
as
well.
the
reason:
if
it
is
not
a
primary
office,
it
doesn't
assure
physical
presence.
and
if
it
is
not
a
primary
office,
it
could
simply
be
a
mail
drop
or
an
answering
service
or
something
like
that.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
well,
in
terms
of
a
primary
office,
then
i
guess
some
line
drawing
would
have
to
be
done
about
whether
in
fact
it
was
a
primary
office.
is
it
really
the
place
where
this
lawyer
spends
most
of
his
or
her
time?
how
do
we
determine
that?
mr.
martin
i.
gross
well,
obviously,
if
it
were
the
only
place
that
one
practiced,
then
it
would
assure
physical
presence
for
the
purpose--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--not
to
meet
the
new
hampshire
requirement,
because
the
new
hampshire
requirements
go
to
more
than
9:00
to
5:00
practice
of
law.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
just
give
me
a
moment.
i
want
to
think.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
she
applied...
she
initially,
before
she
applied
to
take
the
exam,
inquired
whether
an
exemption
might
be
available.
the
answer
was
no.
she
applied
anyway,
signed
a
sworn
statement
indicating--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
yes,
i
will
get...
i
will
focus
on
that
in
just
one
moment,
if
i
may.
that
is
at
joint
appendix
page
43.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
she
was
aware
of
the
residency
requirement
to
begin
with.
she
took
the
exam,
or
she
actually
applied,
signed
a
statement
of
intention
to
reside
in
new
hampshire,
giving
the
address
of
littleton,
new
hampshire.
beyond
that,
i
don't
believe
the
record
indicates
any
place
of
intention
to
take
up
employment.
i
believe
she
stated
in
her
letters
to
the
court
that
she
intended
to
have
employment
in
new
hampshire
in
order
to
avoid
professional
conflicts
with
her
husband,
who
is
a
vermont
attorney.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
i
don't
know
whether
it's
across
from
littleton
or
it's
across
from
lyme.
it
is
across
the
river
from
new
hampshire.
the
state
line
is
the
westerly
boundary
of
connecticut
river,
and
mrs.
piper
lives
about
400
yards--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--oh,
yes.
it
is
up
in
that
neck
of
the
woods,
your
honor.
it
isn't
way
down
at
the
bottom.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
only
by
examination,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
there
is
no
admission
on
motion.
i
think
i'd
like
to
pay
some
attention
to
the
question
that
judge
marshall
asked
about
the
lack
of
revocation,
because
i
gather
it
is
a
matter
of
concern.
there
are
two
reasons
why
i
suppose
it
is
being
argued
in
this
case
that
it
is
important
to
attach...
important
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
doesn't
chase
lawyers
to
assure
they
remain
new
hampshire
residents
after
they
take
the
oath.
the
arguments
seem
to
have
two
purposes.
the
first
is
to
insinuate
bad
faith
or
unworthy
motive
on
the
part
of
new
hampshire's
court,
but
again,
we
suggest
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
unworthy
motivation.
new
hampshire's
reasons
are
what
they
are,
and
they
are
plainly
set
forth
in
the
chief
justice's
affidavit.
the
other
apparent
purpose,
at
least
the
purpose
that
appears
to
me,
is
to
argue
that
the
new
hampshire
residence
requirement
fails
to
meet
this
close
tailoring
test
of
standard
privileges
and
immunities
analysis,
and
i
would
just
like
to
observe
that
it
is
an
odd
argument
that
the
rule
would
have
to
be
more
restrictive
in
order
to
meet
the
close
tailoring
test,
that
is,
more
restrictive
by
requiring
people
to
remain
new
hampshire
residents
to
infinity
in
order
to
keep
their
license.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
yes,
but
i
want
to
express
once
again--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--yes,
it
does,
and
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
to
you
why
in
practice
it
supports
the
justifications.
first
of
all,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
mere
scintilla
of
time.
if
people
are
going
to
deal
in
good
faith
with
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court,
which
i
sincerely
hope
they
would
do
if
they
are
asking
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar,
they
are
asked
to
express
their
intention
to
become
residents
in
the
indefinite
future.
secondly,
the
present
requirement,
and
i
think
this
is
important
to
grasp,
does
the
job
of
promoting
sustained
physical
presence
without
further
restrictions.
even
the
beyond
the
record
figures
cited
in
the
vermont
bar
amicus
brief
show
that
almost
90
percent
of
new
hampshire
lawyers
remain
in
the
state,
and
so
the
present
requirement
seems
to
be
a
practical
success
to
accomplish
these
objectives
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
wants
to
accomplish
without
additional
restrictions.
the
statistics
offered
by
mrs.
piper
and
the
vermont
bar
brief
don't
even
really
show
that
the
13.6
percent
number
they
claim
are
out-of-state
lawyers.
the
problem
with
their
statistics
is
that
they
rely
on
business
mailing
addresses,
not
residence
addresses,
and
the
statistics
sweep
in
lawyers
who
may
be
away
temporarily
on
government
service.
for
example,
the
numbers
show
that
24
new
hampshire
lawyers
had
business
addresses
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
second
highest
number
of
supposed
absentees.
virginia
had
18,
the
fourth
highest.
so,
we
are
talking
about
lawyers
who
may
leave
new
hampshire
temporarily
to
come
down
here
on
government
service,
and
then
may
go
back.
they
are
swept
into
these
statistics,
and
the
statistics
also
sweep
in
lawyer
who
may
practice
in
neighboring
states
but
may
retain
new
hampshire
residence,
and
so
they
are
still
available
to
participate
in
these
additional
activities
that
the
court
requires
of
new
hampshire
lawyers.
and
there
again,
we
see
those
statistics
presented,
and
these
are
at
joint
appendix
page
30:
massachusetts,
96;
main,
19;
vermont,
13.
so,
what
we
see
is
a
rule
which
bites
at
the
time
of
admission
of
the
oath,
and
as
a
practical
matter,
that
is
all
that's
all
it
needs
to
do,
because
as
judge
campbell
of
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
the
new
hampshire
court
could
reasonably
conclude
that
not
many
new
hampshire
lawyers
will
both
pull
up
stakes
and
continue
practice
in
new
hampshire,
and
the
bureaucracy
required
to
keep
track
of
their
comings
and
goings
would
not
be
worth
the
effort.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
is
exactly
what
the
new
hampshire
court
has
concluded,
because
their
present
rule
does
work,
and
it
does
work
as
a
reasonable
proxy
for
sustained
physical
presence
in
the
state
in
order
to
carry
out
these
extensive
additional
duties
that
the
new
hampshire
court
expects
of
members
of
the
new
hampshire
bar.
if
i
can
turn
now
to
the
legal
points
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
first
legal
point
that
we
made
is
that
the
new
hampshire
court's
residency
requirements
shouldn't
be
subject
to
federal
judicial
scrutiny
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
we
are
not
contending
that
state
court
regulations
of
the
bar
are
immune
from
all
constitutional
scrutiny
by
federal
courts.
that
is
simply
not
the
law.
it
is
not
our
argument,
and
we
don't
make
it
here.
what
we
do
argue,
as
the
court
recently
pointed
out
in
united
building
and
construction
trades,
is
that
there
is
a
threshold
issue
to
be
determined
in
every
case
involving
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
whether
the
interest
at
stake
is
fundamental
to
the
promotion
of
interstate
harmony.
and
in
this
case,
the
question
is
whether
state
court
control
over
the
legal
profession
involves
regulation
of
an
interest
fundamental
to
the
promotion
of
a
state--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--i
believe
the
citizens...
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
speaks
of
citizens,
and
so
anyone
who
is
a
citizen
could
claim
it.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
that
may
be
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
in
any
event,
in
new
hampshire,
while
we
may
practice
as
professional
corporations,
in
respect
to
our
duties
to
the
court,
we
are
always
individuals,
and
we
are
held
responsible
as
individuals
to
the
court.
and
while
there
may
be
a
distinction
for
some
purposes,
where,
as
here,
we
are
talking
about
the
relationship
of
a
lawyer
to
the
court
and
what
the
court
expects
of
lawyers,
i
would
not
want
to
claim
that
somehow
practice
in
a
corporate
mode
would
somehow
insulate
a
new
hampshire
lawyer
from
responsibilities
that
they
would
otherwise
have
to
the
court.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
yes,
and
i
understand
and
accept
that.
i
guess
it
does
not
lie
well
in
my
argument
to
take
any
refuge
in
that,
because
i
believe
that
new
hampshire
lawyers'
relationships
with
the
court
are
individual
relationships,
and
so
i
wouldn't
want
to
claim
the
benefit
of
saying
that
anybody
who
was
practicing
in
the
corporate
form
was
any
different
from
a
lawyer
practicing
as
an
individual.
the
matter
of
whether
the
privilege
and
immunities
clause
applies
is
a
threshold
question.
we
rely
on
a
long
line
of
this
court's
decisions
which
say
that
instead
of
being
an
interest
fundamental
to
the
promotion
of
interstate
harmony,
regulation
of
the
bar
is
a
sovereign
function
of
the
state
court,
is
at
the
core
of
the
state's
power
to
protect
the
public,
is
essential
to
the
primary
function
of
administering
justice,
and
involves
the
pursuit
of
an
especially
great
state
interest.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
i
don't
want
to
discard
it.
it
is
a
decision
of
this
court
that
has
never
been
overruled
or
expressly
questioned.
i
believe
that
a
lot
of
things
have
happened
since
bradwell
was
decided.
i
think
this
case
is
ripe
for
decision
under
today's
circumstances,
and
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
believes
that
in
requiring
these
additional
duties
of
new
hampshire
lawyers
it
is
in
tune
with
the
times.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
without
violating...
i
don't
think
it
is
good
law
to
say
that
a
state
court
could
exclude
women
from
the
practice
of
law
for
any
reason,
and
to
put
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
in
there,
i
guess,
would
raise
some
technicality
with
me
about
what
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
designed
to
do.
if
i
were
bringing
the
case
on
behalf
of
a
woman
applicant
who
had
been
denied
admission
simply
because
she
was
a
woman,
i
wouldn't
use
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
i'd
use
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
i
think
i'd
win.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
in
article
4,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
and
as
this
court
has
held
repeatedly,
that
is
a
constitutional
protection
which
is
relative.
it
applies
as
a
threshold
matter
only
where
there
is
an
interest
fundamental
to
promotion
of
interstate
harmony
is
concerned.
it
doesn't
apply
at
all
where,
as
here,
we
argue
that
the
function
of
regulating
the
bar
is
a
very,
very
high
matter
of
importance
to
the
state.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
well,
therein
lies
another
problem
with
a
more
restrictive
rule,
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
and
i
am
addressing
that,
because
i
am
concerned
about
limitations
on
the
right
to
travel.
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
saying
that
if
you
leave,
your
license
is
revoked,
is
that
the
next--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--i
think
they
might
do
that,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
accomplish
the
objectives
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
has
in
mind.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
well,
you
see,
i
don't
believe
that
ties
in
with
what
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
is
trying
to
do.
it
might
well
be
as
a
matter
of
abstract
principle--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--well,
one
of
the
difficulties
i
have
had
is
that
i
haven't
been
able
to
outline
those
specific
reasons.
the
reasons
have
to
do,
i
submit,
not
merely
with
the
everyday
practice
of
law
and
the
matter
of
competence
and
ethical
conduct.
they
have
to
do
with
community
service.
they
have
to
do
with
service
on
bar
committees.
the
have
to
do
with--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--yes,
i
do,
and
i
think
probably
it
would
be
more
restrictive
than
the
rule
we
have.
and
i
am
not
here
to
campaign
for
a
high
degree
of
restriction.
i
am
here
to
campaign
only
for
the
degree
of
restriction
that
this
court
has
deemed
necessary
to
accomplish
these
purposes.
the
point
that
we
have
is
this
on
the
threshold
question.
if
the
interest
of
individual
states
in
regulating
the
bar
is
as
great
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
then
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
interest
fundamental
to
the
promotion
of
interstate
harmony.
the
two
would
seem
to
be
logically
reciprocal,
because
the
greater
degree
of
regulatory
interest
recognized
in
individual
states,
the
lesser
the
interest
in
promoting
interstate
harmony
through
national
treatment
of
the
subject,
and
this
isn't
a
mere
result
of
a
game
of
logic.
the
amicus
brief
of
virginia
and
other
states
shows
a
solid
historical
foundation
for
our
position
in
the
sense
that
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
state
bar
residence
requirements
existed
side
by
side
with
the
clause,
and
were
well
recognized
at
that
time.
and
our
brief
points
out
that
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
didn't
deal
adequately
with
the
threshold
issue
even
though
we
strongly
argued
it.
the
matter
of
in
re
griffiths
has
figured
prominently
in
my
brother's
brief,
all
through
this
proceeding.
we
think
that
griffiths
doesn't
say
anything
about
how
to
decide
this
case.
particularly
does
it
not
say
anything
about
whether
we
have
got
here
an
interest
which
is
fundamental
to
the
promotion
of
interstate
harmony.
griffiths
was
an
equal
protection
case
dealing
with
the
suspect
classification
of
alienage,
and
it
simply
held
that
the
political
function
exemption
doesn't
apply
to
lawyers.
we
don't
claim
lawyers
have
a
political
function
here.
we
claim
that
lawyers
are
subject
to
this
high
degree
of
regulation,
and
that
the
states
have
this
tremendous
interest
in
regulating
lawyers,
because
lawyers
in
effect
share
the
judicial
power.
they
are
different
from
physicians.
they
are
different
from
the
health
care
profession.
they
are
different
from
professions
which
the
states
regulate
in
the
ordinary
exercise
of
the
police
power.
lawyers
share
in
the
administration
of
justice.
they
share
in
the
administration
of
the
judicial
power,
and
we
think
the
state's
interest
in
regulating
lawyers
is
fundamentally
different.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
in
order
to
be
admitted?
mr.
martin
i.
gross
character
and
fitness,
for
openers,
pass
the
bar
examination,
which
consists
of
the
multistate
bar
examination
and
an
essay
examination,
pass
the
multistate
professional
responsibility
examination,
and
show
the
residence
requirement.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
there
is
no
admission
on
motion
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
and
we
share
that
with
several
and
i
believe
a
growing
number
of
states.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
matter
of
deference.
one
of
the
issues--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--i
don't
believe
the
case
is
relevant,
and
i
think
it
is
not
because
i
don't
think
that
the
case
rejected
an
argument
like
the
one
i
am
making,
because
i
think
in
griffiths
what
the
court
said
is
that
alienage
doesn't
make
any
difference
for
bar
admission
under
any
circumstances,
and
we
say
that...
we
are
not
arguing
with
that.
we
are
saying
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
wants
his
physical
presence
in
order
to
perform
these
duties,
and
a
resident
alien
can
do
that
as
well
as
a
resident
citizen,
and
a
resident
alien
can
do
that
better
than
a
nonresident
citizen.
at
this
stage,
i
would
like
to--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--your
honor,
they
are
not
available
on
a
sustained
basis
to
carry
out
the
additional
duties
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
expects
of
them,
and
they
are
not
there
on
a
sustained
basis
to--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--well,
it
hurts
the
state
in
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court's
view,
your
honor,
because
the
court
believes
that
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
state
is
improved
by
activity
by
lawyers
above
and
beyond
their
everyday
practice
of
law.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
one
case
of
a
person
moving
in
and
practicing?
possibly
only
de
minimis,
but
you
can't
deal
with
just
one
case.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
excuse
me?
mr.
martin
i.
gross
not
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
it
would
simply
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
court
to
expect
all
new
hampshire
lawyers
to
conduct
themselves
in
the
way
that
the
court
wants
them
to
with
respect
to
community
activity.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
and
they
are
probably
not
practicing
law
in
new
hampshire
any
more
either,
and
so--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--if
they
move
away,
then
they
are
not
new
hampshire
lawyers
any
more.
as
long
as
they
are
not
attempting
to
practice.
but
our
court
is
saying,
as
long
as
they
are
attempting
to
practice
law
in
new
hampshre,
they
should
share
in
the
obligations
that
our
court
wishes
to
impose
on
them.
thank
you.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
i
am
sure
there
are
some
of
those.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
well,
the
court--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--yes,
i
have
to
say
it
is,
and
i
have
to
say
that
my
response
to
the
point
that
it
is
a
weak
spot
is
that
what
we
have
is
working
very
well
with
a
minimal
degree
of
restriction.
and
yes,
there
are
lawyers
who
go
to
boston
and
who
occasionally
come
up
to
new
hampshire,
but
they
are
a
small
number
compared
to
what
is
actually
the
effect
of
this
rule.
and
in
most
cases
the
lawyers
who...
overwhelming
number
of
cases,
the
lawyers
who
establish
residence
at
the
time
of
admission
stay
there
and
support
the
work
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
expects
of
them,
and
others--
mr.
martin
i.
gross
--well,
it
may
be,
but
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
record
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
there
are
no
such
waivers,
that
the
treatment
that
mrs.
piper
was
accorded
by
the
court
in
this
case
is
100
percent.
mr.
martin
i.
gross
well,
rather
than
use
the
word
"rigid",
i
would
say
applied
uniformly.

[generallaughter.]
mr.
martin
i.
gross
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
