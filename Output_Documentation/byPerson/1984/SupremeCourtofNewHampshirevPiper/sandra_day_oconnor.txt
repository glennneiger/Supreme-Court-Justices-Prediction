mr.
gross,
do
you
think
bradwell
versus
illinois
is
still
good
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
bradwell's
holding
that
a
state
can
exclude
women
from
the
practice
of
law
without
violating
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
still
good
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gross,
before
you
do
that,
and
with
reference
to
your
last
argument,
do
you
think
that
in
re
griffiths,
where
the
court
rejected
the
kind
of
argument
you
are
making
on
behalf
of
lawyers,
is
relevant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
camden
changed
that
test
somewhat?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr....
go
ahead.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
meyer,
in
looking
at
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
issue,
do
we
have
to
look
at
the
threat
posed
by
the
whole
class
rather
than
as
to
the
particular
individual?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
meyer,
do
you
think
that
a
state
bar
requirement
that
the
person
either
live
in
the
state
or
in
an
area
immediately
adjacent
to
it
would
survive
scrutiny?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
would
it
survive
scrutiny?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
state
requirement
charging
out
of
state
residents
more
tuition
to
go
to
a
state
university
than
in-state
residents?
i
suppose
getting
an
education
is
a
fundamental
right
as
well.
would
charging
out
of
state
students
more
tuition
or
making
entrance
requirement
more
difficult
for
them
at
an
in-state
institution
survive
your
kind
of
privileges
and
immunities
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
