justice
rehnquist
the
district
court
said
that
the
respondent,
ms.
piper,
resided
in
lower
waterford.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
right
across
the
river
from
littleton?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
that's
about
120
or
130
miles
that
the
river
is
the
boundary.
is
it
in
the
littleton
area,
say,
rather
than
the
brattleboro
area?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
are
assuming,
aren't
you,
mr.
gross,
that
the
lawyers
in
question
do
business
as
individuals
when
you
say
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
applies
to.
for
instance,
a
lawyer
doing
business
as
a
professional
corporation,
i
presume,
couldn't
claim
the
benefit
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
justice
rehnquist
we
have
held
it
doesn't
apply
to
corporations.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
the
argument
is
quite
the
contrary,
that
if
they
practice
in
the
corporate
form,
they
cannot
get
any
benefit
from
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
which
they
now
are
urging
to
somehow
insulate
themselves.
justice
rehnquist
where
do
you
think
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
found,
i
mean,
what
amendment?
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
state
of
new
hampshire
can
require
you
to
come
physically
to
concord
and
take
the
bar
examination,
or
do
you
think
you
can
have
it
sent
to
you
in
los
angeles?
justice
rehnquist
so
they
would
be
requiring
you
to
reside
in
concord
at
least
for
the
day
that
you
are
in
concord?
justice
rehnquist
out
of
how
many,
mr.
meyer?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
meyer,
let
me
go
back
just
a
moment
to
a
statement
you
made.
you
say
your
client
wanted
to
practice
in
new
hampshire.
now,
does
the
record
show
any
specific
plan,
like,
was
she
going
to
open
an
office
in
littleton?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
your
opponent's
position
basically
that
the
requirement
is
working
the
way
it
is,
that
if
you
have
269
out
of
1,900
living
out
of
state,
the
great
majority
of
those
are
not
attempting
to
practice
in
new
hampshire?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
know?
justice
rehnquist
then
was
this
a
proper
case
for
the
district
court
to
render
summary
judgment
on?
justice
rehnquist
but
your
opponent
argues
the
system
as
it
is
now
is
working.
you
say
it
really
isn't
working.
and
he
says
the
new
hampshire
lawyers
practicing
out
of
state
or
living
out
of
state
are
not
practicing
in
new
hampshire.
you
say
some
of
them
are.
justice
rehnquist
i
wonder
if
that
is
an
entirely
satisfactory
answer.
supposing
that
there
is
an
emergency
application
filed
for
an
injunction,
temperate
tro,
you
know
the
name
of
the
opposing
counsel,
although
he
hasn't
actually
made
an
appearance.
now,
ordinarily
those
things
are
set
on
very
short
notice,
and
if
you
know
the
name
of
the
opposing
counsel,
you
are
supposed
to
get
a
hold
of
him
and
tell
him
about
it.
isn't
that
the
practice
in
new
hampshire,
as
the
law
is
elsewhere?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
this
client
is
represented
by
the
el
fideldo
attorneys
in
los
angeles,
it
is
just
going
to
mean
several
days,
isn't
it,
before
they
can
have
a
hearing,
whereas
if
they
were
represented
by
somebody
in
manchester
or
concord
it,
could
be
tomorrow.
justice
rehnquist
what
about...
i
can
hear
the
other
side
of
the
argument
perhaps
from
you
if
you
were
representing
the
opposing
party,
saying
that,
look,
i
was
in
los
angeles,
but
i
am
a
member
of
the
new
hampshire
bar.
we
got
notice
of
this
expedited
hearing
on
a
tro
on
tuesday.
we
were
told
to
show
up
by
wednesday.
i
couldn't
get
any
red
eye
flight.
i
couldn't
possibly
get
there
until
thursday.
i
was
denied
due
process
of
law.
now,
a
los
angeles
attorney
who
practices
in
new
hampshire
can
make
that
argument.
a
concord
or
manchester
attorney
can't.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
a
while
ago,
the
rule
has
to
apply
to
everybody,
and
it
can
certainly
address
evils
that
aren't
present
in
every
single
case
or
every
single
application.
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
a
claim
were
made
to
them,
whether
they
saw
it
as
an
undue
imposition
or
not,
if
they
felt
that
the
result
required
was
required
by
a
decision
of
this
court,
they
would
be
obligated
to
reach
that
conclusion,
whether
they
were
happy
with
it
or
not.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
meyer,
you
practice
where,
in
manchester?
justice
rehnquist
how
do
attorneys
in
manchester
first
find
out
about
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire?
justice
rehnquist
advance
sheets?
justice
rehnquist
what,
seven
or
eight
months
later?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
also
read
about
them
often
for
the
first
time
in
the
manchester
newspaper?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
concord?
justice
rehnquist
they
would
be
helpful,
though,
wouldn't
they?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
idea
what
percentage
of
the
attorneys
in
new
hampshire
subscribe
to
the
slip
sheet
service?
