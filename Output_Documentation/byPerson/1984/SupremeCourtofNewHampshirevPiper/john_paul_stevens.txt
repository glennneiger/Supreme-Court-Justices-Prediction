justice
stevens
i
notice
the
rules
that
the
court
construe
deal
with
taking
the
bar
exam,
and
the
admission
of
people
who
have
just
taken
the
bar
exam.
what
do
the
rules
provide
with
respect
to
people
who
have
been
admitted
in
other
states
maybe
five
or
ten
years
earlier
and
practiced
for
a
period
of
time?
is
there
any
provision
for,
say,
a
member
of
the
new
york
bar
ever
to
be
admitted?
justice
stevens
it
must
be
by
examination.
justice
stevens
mr.
gross,
i
am
just
wondering
if
your
argument
would...
i
notice
in
your
opponent's
brief
there
are
269
members
of
your
bar
that
have
offices
out
of
state.
do
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
would
have
the
power
to
say
that
they
must
confine
their
practice
to
the
state
in
order
to
further
these
objectives
that
you
describe,
and
not
divert
their
energies
by
practicing
elsewhere?
justice
stevens
i
am
not
suggesting
it
would
be
a
better
rule.
i
am
asking
if
you
think
they
would
have
the
power
to
adopt
such
a
rule.
justice
stevens
no,
i
am
not
saying
if
you
leave.
i
say
just,
a,
you've
got
to
be
a
resident,
and
b,
you
must
confine
your
practice
to
this
state,
because
we
are
interested
in
having
the
highest
quality
practice
within
our
state.
we
don't
want
your
energies
diverted
by
going
over
across
the
river.
justice
stevens
but
you
would
think
they
would
have
constitutional
power
to
do
that?
and
if
you
are
going
to
say
yes
to
that,
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
that's
really
different
from
saying
to
somebody
across
the
river,
you
can't
come
into
the
state.
but
it
seems
to
me
you
must
say
that
you
could
tell
all
the
members
of
your
bar,
don't
practice
elsewhere
if
you
want
to
retain
your
membership.
justice
stevens
all
the
reasons
that
you
have
explained
would
seem
to
me
to
support
such
a
rule.
justice
stevens
right,
and
my
rule
would
serve
those
same
functions.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
record?
i
notice
the
dissent
started
out
by
noting
that
the
rule
might
serve
the
less
than
commendable
purpose
of
insulating
new
hampshire
practitioners
from
out
of
state
competition.
i
am
sure
that
doesn't
really
motivate
this
at
all.

[generallaughter.]
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
suggests
it
might?
justice
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
provide
a
basis
for
the
dissent's
comment,
or
is
that
just
speculation
based
on
judicial
notice?
justice
stevens
i
am
still
not
quite
clear
how
you
answered
my
question.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record?
