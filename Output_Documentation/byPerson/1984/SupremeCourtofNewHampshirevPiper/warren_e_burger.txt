we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
against
piper.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
gross.
chief
justice
burger
what
is
the
requirement
for
taking
the
examination
in
the
first
instance?
is
it
either
residence
or
a
statement
of
intent
to
become
a
resident?
chief
justice
burger
either
one
will
do?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
a
lawyer
from
alexandria
wants
to
come
up
in
practice
in
your
state?
what
must
he
show,
or
she?
chief
justice
burger
yes.
chief
justice
burger
what
if
the
lawyer
has
practiced
for
20
years
in
virginia?
is
there
no--
chief
justice
burger
--no
admission
on
reciprocity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
meyer.
chief
justice
burger
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
rely
on
to
say
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
of
new
hampshire
rather
than
on
the
person
in
the
position
of
your
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
your
friend
told
us
that
in
order
to
take
the
examination
in
the
first
place,
the
applicant
must
represent
that
they
intend
to
make
a
residence
in
new
hampshire
and
practice
law
there,
and
that
without
that
they
are
not
even
permitted
to
take
the
examination.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
isn't
quite
and
fully
consistent
with
your
earlier
response.
you
have
cleared
it
up
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
gross?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
the
case
is
submitted.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
