justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
wouldn't
be
enough
in
new
hampshire.
justice
white
does
the
record
show
anything
about
what
the
lady's
intention
was
with
respect
to
an
office,
or
where
she
was
going
to
practice?
justice
white
did
she
apply
for
an
exemption,
or
for
a
waiver?
justice
white
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
white
do
you
know
where
it
is?
justice
white
thank
you
very
much.
justice
white
doesn't
it
bear
on
the
strength
of
your
justifications
for
your
rule
if
it
is
clear
that
a
lawyer
who
is
a
resident
of
new
hampshire
can
move
out
of
the
state
and
still
practice
law
in
new
hampshire?
because
a
lot
of
the
reasons
that
you
give
would
sort
of
wash
out
with
him.
you
wouldn't
have
control
over
him.
you
couldn't
control
his
pro
bono
work,
et
cetera.
justice
white
yes?
is
that
right,
or
not?
it
does
bear
on
the
strength
of
your
justification?
justice
white
mr.
gross,
is
there
any
record
of
waivers
for
people
who
say,
i
live
across
the
border,
i
want
to
commute
into
new
hampshire
and
practice
law,
and
i
have
a
job
with
a
law
firm,
i
want
a
waiver,
and
if
you
will
give
it
to
me,
i
will
take
the
bar,
and
go
to
work
in
new
hampshire?
is
there
any
record
of
waivers
in
those
situations?
justice
white
right,
well,
and
so
you
feel
the
rule
is
that
rigid,
that
it
just
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
white
but
your
position
is
also
that
this
rule
is
unconstitutional
even
if
the
applicant
wants
to
have
her
principal
office
in
vermont.
justice
white
well,
would
you
be
satisfied
if
we
ruled
in
your
favor
to
the
extent
that
at
least
where
the
intention
is
to
commute
into
new
hampshire
to
your
principal
legal
office?
justice
white
well,
but
how
about
satisfying
your
client?
justice
white
it
may
not
satisfy
your
organization,
but
it
may--
justice
white
--i
see
it,
on
page
41,
42?
justice
white
yes.
