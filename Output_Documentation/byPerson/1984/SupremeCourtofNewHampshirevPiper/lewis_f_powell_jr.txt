justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
meyer,
before
you
get
into
that,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
is
the
issue
before
us
only
related
to
lawyers
who
are
willing
to
take
the
bart
in
new
hampshire
and
who
have
taken
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
one
of
those
standards
may
be
that
the
bar
examination
of
your
state
must
be
passed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
meyer,
on
that
particular
question,
what
if
the
lawyer
lives
in
chicago,
or
san
francisco,
or
new
orleans?
is
it
your
view
that
the
new
hampshire
court
would
have
the
right
to
appoint
him
to
defend
an
indigent
criminal
and
compel
him
to
come
to
new
hampshire
to
try
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
as
a
practical
matter
they
could
perform
those
obligations?
depending
on
where
they
live,
i
suppose.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
does
impose
a
burden
on
the
court.
i
know
when
i
was
practicing
law,
the
judge
would
call
you
on
the
telephone
and
say,
we
have
an
indigent
who
needs
counsel,
are
you
available,
and
he
gets
an
answer
right
away.
i
suppose
he
could
call
long
distance
to
new
orleans.
