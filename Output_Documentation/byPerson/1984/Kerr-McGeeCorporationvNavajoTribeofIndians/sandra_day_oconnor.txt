justice
o'connor
mr.
shrago,
do
you
think
the
merrion
decision
recognized
only
a
limited
sovereign
power
to
tax
conditioned
on
the
requirement
of
the
secretary's
approval?
justice
o'connor
well,
your
answer
to
my
question
is
basically
no,
and
if
that
is
the
case,
why
should
we
distinguish
among
tribes
governed
by
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
tribes
that
aren't?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
there
any
specific
provision
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
that
requires
secretarial
approval
of
taxes?
justice
o'connor
and
the
tribes
retained,
if
they
didn't
adopt
a
constitution,
certain
sovereign
powers,
did
they
not?
justice
o'connor
did
they
not?
justice
o'connor
okay.
and
so
the
question
is
whether
the
power
to
tax
is
one
of
those
sovereign
powers.
justice
o'connor
and
the
court
said,
yes,
it
includes
that.
justice
o'connor
mr.
claiborne,
in
your
view,
what
is
the
source
of
the
secretary's
authority
to
approve
any
tribal
tax?
justice
o'connor
is
it
presently
the
secretary's
view
that
tribes
with
a
written
constitution
under
the
ira
can
amend
their
constitution
and
the
secretary
will
approve
it
if
the
amendment
is
to
withdraw
secretarial
approval
to
impose
taxes?
justice
o'connor
does
the
secretary
think
there
are
any
other
overriding
provisions
of
federal
law,
constitutional
or
otherwise,
that
might
impact
on
the
exercise
by
the
tribe
of
its
taxing
powers?
justice
o'connor
the
commerce
clause
or
anything
else?
