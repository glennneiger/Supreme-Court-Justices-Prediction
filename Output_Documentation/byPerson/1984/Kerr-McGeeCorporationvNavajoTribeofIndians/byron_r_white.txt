justice
white
well,
the
navajos
maybe
knew
what
they
were
doing.
justice
white
well,
they
just
knew
better.
justice
white
may
be.
justice
white
what
is
the
explanation
or
the
speculation
as
to
why
the
tribes,
some
tribes
or
perhaps
all
of
them
who
adopted
constitutions
put
in
this
requirement
of
secretarial
approval?
justice
white
what
authority
would
the
secretary
have
under
federal
law
to
approve
or
disapprove
a
taxing
ordinance
even
though
the
tribal
constitution
required
it
to
do?
could
the
tribe
confer
power
on
the
secretary?
justice
white
i
would
think
the
secretary
would
say,
i
don't
see
any
federal
statute
that
gives
me
any
power
to
approve
or
disapprove
of
a
taxing
ordinance
of
any
tribe.
justice
white
well,
then,
what
do
you
make
out
of
the
statement
in
merrion
that
the
secretary's,
at
least
in
connection
with
that
tribe,
the
jicarillas...
it
sounded
from
reading
that
opinion
as
though
the
secretary
had
legal
authority
to
turn
down
a
taxing
ordinance
with
respect
to
the
jicarillas.
justice
white
why
would
that
give
the
secretary
authority?
justice
white
i
know,
but
how
could
the
secretary...
why
would
the
secretary
purport
to
approve
or
disapprove
in
the
absence
of
some
statute?
justice
white
well,
if
the
secretary
is
purporting
then
to
exercise
its
authority,
i
just
again
wonder
where
he
think
he
gets
it.
and
if
he
has
it
there,
i
don't
know,
maybe
you
can
find
it
in
that
same
source
whether
the
tribe
has
a
constitution
or
not.
justice
white
do
you
think
congress
has
authorized
the
secretary
to
approve
or
disapprove
any
indian
taxing
ordinance?
justice
white
it
has
now
arisen,
the
question
has.
justice
white
--well,
the
question
arises
whether
the
secretary
has
congressional
authority
to
perform
that
function.
that
is
my
question
to
you.
does
he
or
doesn't
he?
justice
white
i
know
you
aren't,
but
where
is
the
congressional
authority
that
you
say
is
necessary
for
the
secretary
to
perform
that
function?
justice
white
i
take
it
your
bottom
line,
then,
would
be
that
if
the
secretary
turns
it
down,
the
tribe
may
put
it
into
effect
anyway.
justice
white
insofar
as
federal
law
is
concerned.
justice
white
so
the
provisions
in
these
constitutions
is
just,
we
want
to
submit
the
ordinance
and
approve
it
if
you
want
to
but
you
are
not
authorized
to
disapproved
it.
justice
white
ms.
bernstein,
are
these
leases,
tribal
leases
to
kerr-mcgee
or
other
private...
are
they
subject
to
approval
by
the
secretary?
justice
white
normally
in
administering
these
mineral
leases
or
oil
and
gas
leases,
if
kerr-mcgee
or
the
lessee
refused
to
live
up
to
one
of
the
terms
of
the
lease,
what
happens?
does
the
tribe
give
notice
that
the
lease
is
terminated,
or
does
it
take
the
secretary's
approval?
justice
white
i
suppose
if
this
tribal
ordinance
is
as
valid
as
you
suggest
it
is,
and
kerr-mcgee
refused
to
pay
it,
to
pay
the
tax,
i
supposed
the
tribe
would
think
it
should
be
able
to
cancel
the
lease.
justice
white
and
none
of
which
would
require
the
secretary's
approval.
justice
white
well,
what
about
taxing
half
the
producers
on
the
reservation
and
not
taxing
the
other
half?
justice
white
what
would
that
trigger,
if
anything?
justice
white
well,
what
is
the
basis
for
your
position?
mr.
claiborne
says
it
is
either
this,
that,
or
that.
is
it
your
contention
that
it
has
always
been
necessary
for
the
secretary
to
approve
an
indian
taxing
ordinance,
always,
or
do
you
rest
on
the
ira?
justice
white
well,
on
both,
you
don't
need
the
second
if
you
are
resting
on
the
first.
it
has
always
been
true.
is
that
it?
