this
is
a
delegated
power
from
the
tribe
to
the
secretary,
isn't
it?
they
didn't
have
to
give
it
to
them
in
the
first
place,
did
they?
chief
justice
burger
then
it
is
a
delegated
power
in
effect
like
appointing
an
agent,
is
it
not,
appointing
the
secretary
as
agent
for
the
tribe
for
certain
purposes.
would
you
agree
with
that?
