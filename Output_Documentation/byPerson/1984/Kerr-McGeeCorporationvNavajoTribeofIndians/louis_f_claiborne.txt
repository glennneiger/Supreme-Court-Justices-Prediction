mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioners
have,
in
my
view
and
perhaps
in
the
court's
view,
never
really
explained
what
their
argument
is,
whether
it
is
that
the
power
of
indian
tribes
to
tax
which
survived
dependent
status
was
conditioned,
hobbled,
limited
for
the
first
time
in
1934
or
1938,
depending
upon
whether
they
are
relying
on
the
indian
reorganization
act
or
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act,
or
whether
their
argument
is
that
long
before
that
and
independent
of
those
acts
of
congress
the
power
of
indian
tribes
to
tax
non-indians
doing
business
on
a
reservation
was
always
subject
to
secretarial
or
federal
approval.
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
do
not
choose
between
these
two
alternatives,
because
either
one
leads
to
a
dead
end.
the
first,
the
one
seemingly
most
emphasized,
that
is,
reliance
on
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
the
indian
leasing
act
of
1938,
obviously
founders
on
the
main
objective
of
those
two
statutes,
which
were
to
increase,
not
decrease,
indian
self-government,
to
maximize,
not
to
hobble
the
power
of
indian
tribes
to
earn
their
own
revenues
through
taxation
and
other
means.
furthermore,
they
have
difficulties
under
the
text
of
both
of
those
statutes.
as
we
know,
the
indian
reorganization
act,
first
of
all,
is
optional.
it
requires
no
tribe
to
agree
or
not
to.
it
requires
no
tribe
that
does
come
under
the
act
to
adopt
a
constitution.
it
requires
no
such
constitution
to
provide
that
taxing
ordinances
in
particular
or
any
others
shall
be
subject
to
secretarial
approval.
accordingly,
the
ira
is
simply
not
a
proper
source
for
insisting
that
congress
imposed
secretarial
approval
as
a
precondition
to
the
validity
of
any
taxing
ordinance
effecting
non-indians.
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1938,
similar
problems
arise.
that
act,
to
be
sure,
does
give
the
secretary
pervasive
regulation
of
leasing,
the
management
of
indian
property,
and
area
traditionally
governed,
controlled,
supervised
pervasively
by
the
government,
but
the
act
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
exercise
not
of
the
landlord's
right
but
of
the
governmental
prerogatives
of
an
indian
tribe,
including
the
power
of
taxation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
o'connor,
in
the
particular
case
of
provisions
in
ira
constitutions,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
source
is
the
ira
itself
insofar
as
congress
said
the
constitution
adopted
pursuant
to
this
act
shall
be
valid
only
when
approved
by
the
secretary,
and
impliedly
congress
presumably
permitted
the
secretary
or
the
tribe
or
the
two
together
to
include
within
such
constitutions
further
approval
requirements
with
respect
to
certain
kinds
of
legislation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so,
justice
o'connor,
and
as
counsel
for
petitioners
correctly
stated,
our
brief
recites
that
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
department
of
interior
for
some
years
now
not
merely
to
approve
amendments
to
constitutions
to
remove
what
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
are
unnecessary
secretarial
review
provisions,
but
to
encourage
amendment
of
tribal
constitutions
to
that
end,
and
a
substantial
number
of
tribal
constitutions
have
recently
been
amended
with
that
in
mind.
why
don't
we
turn
to
the
alternative
argument
that
seems
to
be
made
in
part
by
the
petitioners?
that
is
that
from
time
immemorial,
at
least
since
the
tribes
became
subject
to
the
jurisdictions
of
the
united
states,
their
power
of
taxation
has
been
somehow
subjected
to
federal
approval.
that
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
the
power
of
taxation
did
not
survive,
and
it
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
the
privilege
of
asking
the
secretary,
if
you
agree,
may
we
tax,
and
only
if
he
says
yes
may
they
do
it.
so
that
is
hardly
a
sovereign
inherent
power
that
survived
dependent
status
in
the
sense
in
which
this
court
indicated
that
power
both
in
the
coville
and
in
the
merrion
cases.
it
is,
moreover,
completely
at
odds
with
the
historic
distinction
between
the
supervision
of
the
united
states
over
the
property
management
function
and
attributes
of
indian
sovereignty.
in
order
to
protect
tribal
land,
in
order
to
protect
the
indians
from
being
taken
advantage
of
by
outsiders,
by
their
neighbors,
by
those
who
were
selling
them
goods,
the
government
has
traditionally
since
the
first
nonintercourse
act
in
1790
and
in
a
series
of
treaties
and
legislation
ever
since
quite
pervasively
regulated
property
transactions
so
as
to
protect
the
indians
from
being
taken
advantage
of.
there
is
nothing,
nothing
at
all
comparable
on
the
side
of
the
exercise
of
indian
sovereign
prerogatives,
including
the
taxing
power.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
o'connor--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--this
court
in
the
merrion
case
was
somewhat
undecided
as
to
whether
the
commerce
clause
in
a
full-fledged
way
limited
the
exercise
of
taxing
power
by
indian
tribes.
for
present
purposes
we
accept
that
it
would,
or
that
the
indian
commerce
clause,
its
analogue,
would
present
a
limit
on
the
kind
of
discriminatory
taxation
that
might
be
envisaged.
of
course,
there
is
a
territorial
limitation,
the
basis
on
which
the
hopi
ordinance
was
disapproved,
and
that
is
subject
to,
in
our
view,
to
control
by
federal
courts
as
the
challenge
in
this
court,
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us,
is
properly
a
case
within
federal
jurisdiction
and
properly
carried
through
the
federal
courts
here,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
exhausting
tribal
remedies
which
may
or
may
not
have--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
that
might
indeed
result
in--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
in
line
with
the
martinez
decision,
it
presumably
would
not
trigger
a
claim
under
the
indian
civil
rights
act,
though
it
is
not
clear
to
us
whether
the
court
in
martinez
really
meant
to
bar
all
challenges
under
that
statute,
including
those
by
non-indians
who
have
no
other
recourse.
it
is
arguable
that
that
decision
left
that
question
for
another
day,
and
such
a
day
is,
of
course,
not
here.
there
is
no
charge
here
of
any
discrimination.
indians
as
well
as
non-indians
are
equally
taxed.
let
me
say
one
final
word,
and
that
is
about
the
administrative
construction
of
the
relevant
statutory
background
by
the
department
of
the
interior.
it
is
charged
that
we
have
on
the
one
hand
said
that
it
is
a
good
idea
to
subject
tribal
taxation
to
federal
approval
and
today
take
a
difference
stance.
there
is
a
consistent
strand,
which
is
this.
the
department
of
interior
has
at
all
times
taken
the
view,
correctly,
that
federal
law,
congress
has
not
required
it
to
approve
or
disapprove
any
ordinance,
but
has
permitted
it
to
insist
through
the
ira
and
the
writing
of
tribal
constitutions
that
for
a
time
in
specific
circumstances
it
was
a
wise
idea,
not
mandated
by
congress,
but
permitted
by
congress
to
the
secretary,
to
supervise
the
exercise
of
tribal
taxation,
but
as
was
no
doubt
anticipated,
the
indian
reorganization
act
succeeded
to
an
extent
where
it
is
now
felt,
quite
consistently,
that
the
day
has
come
when
that
supervision
is
no
longer
necessary,
and
accordingly
it
is
now
the
policy
of
the
department
to
remove
that
superintendence
which
was
once
thought
more
appropriate.
i
think
i
have
nothing
further.
