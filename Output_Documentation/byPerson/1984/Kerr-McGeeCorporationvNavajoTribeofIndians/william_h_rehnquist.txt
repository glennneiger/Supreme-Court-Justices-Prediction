justice
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
secretary's
opinion
with
respect
to
that
proposed
constitution?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
one
you
just
adverted
to.
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
he
express
the
view
that
there
was
some
statute
on
the
books
that
would
require
them
to
be
subject
to
secretarial
review
as
opposed
to
simply
having
it
desirable
as
a
matter
of
choice?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
congress
didn't
require
the
tribes
to
adopt
constitutions.
justice
rehnquist
what
standard
does
the
secretary
use
in
that
situation?

authority--
justice
rehnquist

opponent
contends
that
they
have
no
real
way
of
challenging
those
things
because
of
the
santa
clara
case.
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
your
opponent
is
right,
that
they
don't
have
any
way
of
challenging.
