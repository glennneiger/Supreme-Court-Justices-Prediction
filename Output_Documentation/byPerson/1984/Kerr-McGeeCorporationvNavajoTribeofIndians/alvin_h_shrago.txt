mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
indian
tribe
may
unilaterally,
without
any
approval
whatsoever
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
impose
taxes
on
non-indian
oil
and
gas
lessees.
this
issue
arises
in
this
case
in
the
context
of
the
navajo
tribe
of
indians,
which
has
never
adopted
any
constitution
at
all,
and
which
in
fact
has
twice
rejected
invitations
by
the
congress
to
adopt
constitutions,
first
in
section
16
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934,
and
second
in
section
6
of
the
navajo
hopi
rehabilitation
act
of
1950.
in
june
of
1982,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona
held
that
the
taxes,
business
activity
tax
and
the
possessory
interest
tax
were
invalid
because
they
lacked
secretarial
approval.
that
decision
was
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
april
of
1984,
which
held
that
secretarial
approval
was
not
required.
the
case
appears
here
today
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows.
the
petitioner
conducts
oil
and
gas
operations
on
navajo
lands
situated
in
the
state
of
arizona,
lands
that
were
set
aside
by
the
treaty
of
1868.
these
operations
are
conducted
pursuant
to
leases
issued
by
the
tribe
and
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or,
more
precisely,
by
his
delegate,
pursuant
to
sections
396a
and
396e
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1938,
title
25,
united
states
code.
from
1967
to
1979,
the
petitioner
has
paid
over
$7,500,000
in
royalties
in
connection
with
these
operations,
and
over
$111,300
in
rentals.
from
1979
to
1984,
the
petitioner
has
paid
over
$6,100,000
in
royalties,
and
over
$104,800
in
rentals.
these
payments
are
not
made
to
the
tribe.
they
are
not
made
to
tribal
officials.
they
are
made,
rather,
to
officials
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
who
handled
these
funds
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
there
is
no
question
that
the
rate
of
royalty
in
these
leases
is
fair
and
equitable.
it
is
set
at
16
and
two-thirds
percent.
it
is
a
one-sixth
rate
of
royalty.
the
two
taxes
at
issue
here,
the
possessory
interest
tax
and
the
business
activity
tax,
were
enacted
in
january
of
1978
and
in
april
of
1978
by
the
navajo
tribal
council.
the
resolutions
implementing
these
taxes
explicitly
state
that
the
taxes
are
to
be
effective,
and
i
quote,
"after
approval
by
the
navajo
tribal
council.
"
the
taxes
were
not
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
taxes
purport
to
enable
the
navajo
tax
commission
to
impose
a
number
of
penalties
for
non-compliance,
including
the
penalty
to
attach
and
seize
assets
of
the
petitioner
on
the
reservation,
including
the
penalty
to
suspend
or
to
prominently
revoke
all
rights
of
the
petitioner
to
engage
in
productive
activity
on
the
reservation,
notwithstanding
the
right
that
was
so
granted
to
the
petitioner
in
the
leases
themselves.
the
complaint
was
filed
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
challenge
the
validity
of
these
taxes
in
may
of
1979.
it
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
mexico
because
petitioner
also
has
operations
on
navajo
land
situated
on
the
new
mexico
side
of
the
border.
these
are
uranium
mining
operations,
and
are
far
larger
in
scope
than
the
oil
and
gas
operations
which
are
situated
on
navajo
lands
in
arizona.
the
federal
district
judge
in
new
mexico
dismissed
petitioner's
claims
against
the
tribe
and
the
tax
commission
themselves
on
the
grounds
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
the
remaining
claims
proceeded
against
tribal
officials
on
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
on
the
allegations
that
tribal
officials
were
purporting
to
exceed
their
lawful
authority.
in
march
of
1980,
the
district
judge
in
new
mexico
transferred
that
portion
of
petitioner's
challenge
to
these
taxes
which
dealt
with
its
operations
in
arizona
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona.
the
district
court
in
new
mexico
stayed
all
further
proceedings
in
new
mexico
pending
resolution
of
issues
that
at
that
time
were
pending
before
the
tenth
circuit,
and
which
subsequently
were
pending
before
the
united
states
supreme
court.
i
am
referring
to
the
merrion
decision.
the
case
in
new
mexico
has
still
been
stayed.
it
is
still
presently
under
a
stay.
in
arizona,
all
proceedings
were
stayed
until
this
court
had
rendered
its
decision
in
the
merrion
case.
when
the
court
rendered
its
decision
in
merrion,
district
judge
william
koppel
entertained
motions
for
summary
judgment
that
had
been
filed
by
all
of
the
litigants.
he
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
petitioner,
holding
the
taxes
to
be
void
and
invalid
because
they
lacked
secretarial
approval.
he
based
his
decision
on
the
collateral
estoppel
effect
of
a
similar
decision
that
had
been
rendered
in
similar
litigation
in
the
district
of
utah,
and
in
addition
he
held
in
any
event
after
merrion
the
tribe
was
required
to
obtain
secretarial
approval
before
these
taxes
could
become
effective.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
that
decision.
the
ninth
circuit
held,
and
i
quote,
"secretarial
approval
is
required
only
of
those
tribes
that
have
chosen
to
include
such
a
requirement
in
their
constitution
bylaws
or
charters.
"
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
refer
to
this
court's
decision
in
merrion
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
and
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
state
any
basis
for
that
rationale.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
yes,
justice
blackmun,
the
tenth
circuit,
before
the
ninth
circuit
rendered
its
decision,
had
rendered
a
decision
in
the
case
of
southland
royalty
versus
navajo
tribe
of
indians
in
which
it
had
reversed
the
decision
of
the
federal
district
judge
in
utah,
and
the
ninth
circuit
incorporated
by
reference
the
reasoning
and
the
result
in
the
tenth
circuit's
decision.
it
is
our
position
that
this
holding
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
and
fundamentally
misconstrues
the
very
basic
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribes.
this
is
a
holding
which
effectuates
a
radical
change
in
some
200
years
of
tradition
and
custom
of
federal
supervision
over
relations
between
indians
and
non-indians.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
merrion
decision
recognized
that
indian
tribes
generally
have
an
inherent
power
to
tax.
however,
i
think
the
decision
in
merrion
also
recognized
that
the
congress
has
regulated
the
manner
and
extent
to
which
indian
tribes
may
exercise
that
power,
and
that
is
precisely--
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
--because
as
this
court
held
in
merrion,
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
set
forth
a
procedure
whereby
tribes
should
adopt
constitutions
and
then
if
they
wish
to
tax
non-indians,
announce
their
intention
to
tax
non-indians
and
have
their
taxing
ordinances
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
court
was
explicit
in
explaining
that
this
was,
and
i
quote,
"the
administrative
process
established
by
congress
to
monitor
such
exercises
of
tribal
authority.
"
the
congress
has
regulated
the
manner
and
extent
in
which
an
inherent
power
may
be
exercised.
in
fact,
this
is
a
point
that
justice
stewart--
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
--no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
is
no
mention
of
taxes
themselves
in
the
indian
reorganization
act.
there
is
specific
mention
in
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
the
concept
of
secretarial
approval
with
respect
to
the
constitution
itself.
and
i
might
add
that
in
1954,
after
the
congress
had
extended
a
second
invitation
to
the
navajos
to
adopt
a
constitution
in
section
6
of
the
navajo
hopi
rehabilitation
act
of
1950,
the
solicitor
rendered
an
opinion,
and
he
was
referring
to
the
very
language
in
section
6
of
that
act,
the
existing
law
language,
which
was
taken
almost
verbatim
from
section
16
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934.
and
the
solicitor
explained
that
when
a
tribe
adopts
a
constitution
that
allows
it
to
exercise
powers
vested
by
existing
law,
that
incorporated
within
the
notion
of
vested
by
existing
law
is
that
before
the
exercise
can
take
place,
the
secretary
must
approve
the
exercise.
that
was
the
secretary's
interpretation
as
late
as
1954.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
no,
your
honor,
this
was
in
connection
with
a
proposed
constitution
that
was
being
drafted
and
circulated
to
the
secretary
for
his
review,
the
constitution
that
was
being
proposed
for
the
navajos
to
adopt
under
section
6
of
the
navaho
hopi
rehabilitation
act.
they
never
adopted
it.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
the
proposed...
the
secretary
had
a
number
of
opinions
with
respect
to
that
proposed
constitution.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
yes,
he
did
observe
that
there
were
some
powers
that
were
articulated
in
this
proposed
constitution
that
should
be
subject
to
secretarial
review,
and
he
had
some
criticisms
about
the
constitution
that
had
at
that
time
been
drafted.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
he
expressed
the
view
that
the
language
existing
law,
vesting
tribes
with
authority
to
exercise
powers
according
to
existing
law,
the
same
language
that
had
been
used
in
the
1934
act,
necessarily
included
the
understanding
that
those
powers,
before
they
could
be
exercised,
must
be
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
this,
of
course,
is
the
understanding
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
had
at
the
very
outset,
from
adoption
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934.
it
is
very
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
and
it
is
very
clear
from
the
contemporaneous
administrative
interpretation.
for
example,
commissioner
john
collier,
who
was
the
draftsman
of
the
wheeler-howard
bill,
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934,
explained,
and
i
quote:
"the
bill
provides
the
machinery
for
a
progressive
establishment
of
home
rule
by
tribes
or
groups
of
indians.
"
it
is
that
machinery,
the
adoption
of
a
constitution
and
approval
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
which
is
precisely
what
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
designed
to
accomplish.
that
is
precisely,
as
this
court
recognized
in
merrion,
the
administrative
process
established
by
congress
to
monitor
such
exercises
of
tribal
authority.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
this
was
optional
with
the
tribes.
this
was
true
of
the
original
bill.
it
was
true
of
the
bill
as
it
proceeded
through
the
congress.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
your
honor,
there
is
a
difference
between--
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
--i
would
say
yes.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
i
believe
that
question
has
been
answered
in
merrion,
and
we
are
not--
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
--that's
correct,
but
the
court
also
went
further
and
said
that
before
the
power
to
tax
could
be
exercised,
it
had
to
be
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
in
fact
justice
marshall
in
the
opinion
in
merrion
explicitly
made
the
distinction
between
the
existence
of
a
sovereign
power
to
tax,
which
he
explained,
that
neither
the
tribe's
constitution,
in
that
case
the
jicarilla
apache
tribe,
nor
the
federal
constitution
is
the
font
of
any
tribal
sovereign
power
to
tax.
but
he
also
explained,
however,
that
in
light
of
the
indian
reorganization
act,
amendment
of
the
tribe's
constitution
to
authorize
the
tax,
to
announce
the
intention
to
tax,
was
the
necessary
event
or
the
critical
event,
as
i
believe
he
put
it,
necessary
to
effectuate
the
tax,
and
the
word
"effectuate"
was
highlighted.
in
short,
again
we
are
talking
about
existence
of
a
power
and
the
manner
and
extent
by
which
the
congress
has
regulated
that
power.
at
the
present
time,
it
is
essential
that
there
be
this
administrative
process
for
review
of
the
tribal
taxing
power.
as
the
court
mentioned
in
merrion,
secretarial
approval
is
a
necessary
constraint
to
minimize
the
potential
concern
that
tribes
may
exercise
the
power
to
tax
in
an
unfair
or
unprincipled
manner,
or
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
overriding
national
interests.
under
this
court's
interpretation
of
santa
clara
pueblo
versus
martinez,
we
cannot
challenge
the
unfairness
of
this
tax
under
the
due
process
or
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
of
1968,
nor
can
we
challenge
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
problems
we
have
with
these
taxes
under
the
federal
constitution,
since
it
has
been
held
that
those
limitations
do
not
apply
to
indian
tribes.
in
short,
the
only
relief
that
we
have
is
if
this
administrative
process
established
by
congress
to
monitor
such
exercises
of
tribal
authority
is
upheld
and
respected
by
the
secretary.
that
in
fact
is
exactly
what
the
secretary
did
in
connection
with
the
hopi
indian
tribe,
which
of
course
resides
on
the
land
situated
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
navajo
tribe.
they
attempted
to
enact
a
severance
tax,
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
actually
the
assistant
secretary,
disapproved
the
tax
because
in
his
opinion
it
violated
the
due
process
provision
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
of
1968.
now,
the
hopi
tribe
has--
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
--thank
you.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
merrion,
this
court,
referring
to
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934,
and
the
adoption
of
tribal
constitutions
to
announce
tribal
intentions
to
tax
as
well
as
secretarial
approval
of
the
specific
taxing
ordinances,
held,
and
i
quote,
"here
the
congress
has
affirmatively
acted
by
providing
a
series
of
checkpoints
that
must
be
clear
before
a
tribal
tax
can
take
effect.
"
this
was
a
point
as
to
which
the
court
in
merrion
was
unanimous.
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent
explained
that
to
the
extent
that
the
power
to
tax
was
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
possessed
by
indian
tribes
when
the
reorganization
was
passed,
congress
intended
the
statute
to
preserve
those
powers
for
all
indian
tribes
that
adopted
a
formal
organization
under
the
act.
the
serious
problem
with
the
construction
that
the
ninth
circuit
gave
to
the
indian
reorganization
act
is
that
it
imputed
to
the
congress
and
to
the
executive
officials
of
this
nation,
including
john
collier
himself,
an
intention
to
deceive
the
indian
tribes
of
this
country
by
going
around
the
country
and
telling
them,
this
act
is
for
your
benefit,
this
is
an
act
which
is
going
to
strengthen
your
tribal
powers,
this
is
an
act
which
is
going
to
free
you
more
and
more
from
federal
control.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
that
is
exactly
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make,
justice
white,
that
if
you
adopt
the
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
--that
they
knew
better
than
the
draftsmen
of
the
legislation
and
the
congress
i
think
is
a
remarkable
conclusion
to
reach.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
nevertheless,
if
that
conclusion
is
reached,
then
the
majority
of
indian
tribes
in
this
nation
that
adopted
constitutions
under
the
ira
have
been
frankly
tricked
by
the
congress,
by
president
roosevelt,
by
commissioner
collier,
by
the
federal
government
for
50
years.
and
in
fact
as
the
tenth
circuit
recognized
in
the
southland
royalties
company
case
which
is
presently
pending
on
a
petition
for
rehearing,
if
this
interpretation
is
upheld
of
the
indian
reorganization
act,
it
will
encourage
tribes
which
have
adopted
constitutions
to
repudiate
their
constitutions
so
that
they
may
exercise
these
powers
without
federal
supervision
and
federal
control.
this
would
be
the
remarkable
conclusion
that
the
objectives
of
an
act
of
congress
can
best
be
furthered
by
ignoring
and
repudiating
the
act
altogether.
it
simply
makes
no
sense.
the
need
for
secretarial
approval,
of
course,
is
unquestioned.
as
the
court
observed
in
merrion
itself,
secretarial
approval
is
one
of
those
constraints
that
minimizes
potential
concern
that
the
tribal
taxing
power
may
be
exercised
in
an
unfair
or
unprincipled
manner,
or
that
it
may
be
exercised
in
a
manner
that
is
inconsistent
with
overriding
national
interests.
the
secretary
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
is
the
only
one
who
can
oversee
the
propriety
of
these
tribal
exercises
of
power.
under
the
martinez
decision,
the
violation
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
by
implementation
of
tribal
power
in
a
civil
context
as
opposed
to
the
criminal
context
simply
cannot
be
reviewed
by
a
federal
court.
indeed,
as
the
secretary
has
recently
invalidated
or
refused
to
approve
the
severance
tax
enacted
by
the
hopi
tribe
on
the
grounds
that
it
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
of
1968,
we
see
no
reason,
no
basis,
no
principle
either
in
logic
or
in
fact
by
which
the
secretary
could
claim
that
the
identical
tax
which
offends
the
identical
due
process
clause
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
of
1968
should
somehow
be
permitted
to
be
implemented
merely
because
the
other
tribe
has
not
adopted
a
constitution
under
the
ira
or
under
similar
legislation,
and
in
fact
has
not
adopted
a
constitution
at
all.
to
the
contrary,
we
believe
that
the
need
for
secretarial
review,
federal
oversight
of
tribal
exercises
of
the
taxing
power
is
all
the
more
pressing
in
the
case
of
those
tribes
which
have
refused
to
adopt
constitutions
than
it
is
in
the
case
of
those
tribes
which
have
at
least
followed
the
congressional
policy
and
adopted
constitutions.
after
all,
the
constitutional
form
of
government
in
this
nation
is
basic,
principal,
and
fundamental.
in
new
mexico
versus
mescalero
apache
tribe,
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
involving
hunting
and
fishing
rights
and
regulation
of
those
rights
by
the
state
or
by
the
tribe,
this
court
observed
that
federal
law
commits
to
the
secretary
and
to
the
tribe
the
responsibility
to
manage
the
reservation's
resources.
the
court
also
unanimously
held
that
federal
law
requires
the
secretary
to
approve
the
tribe's
hunting
and
fishing
ordinances,
which
of
course
the
secretary
had
done
in
that
case.
this,
of
course,
was
also
a
matter
on
which
the
court
had
remarked
in
united
states
versus
wheeler,
a
case
involving
the
navajo
tribe
itself.
in
wheeler,
the
court
distinguished
between
the
existence
of
an
inherent
power,
and
that
was
the
basis
on
which
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
majority
and
the
minority
in
merrion,
whether
as
a
matter
of
inherent
tribal
power,
the
power
existing,
not
on
whether
the
manner
and
extent
of
that
power
had
been
regulated
by
the
congress.
the
court
in
wheeler,
a
case
involving
the
navajo
tribe,
explained
that
congress
has
in
certain
ways
regulated
the
manner
and
extent
of
the
tribal
power
of
self-government
does
not
mean
that
congress
is
the
source
of
that
power.
we
have
the
difference
between
existence
of
the
power
and
the
manner
in
which
that
power
can
be
exercised.
the
congress
intended
that
for
tribes
to
exercise
the
power
to
tax
against
non-indians,
at
the
very
least
that
tax
must
be
approved
by
the
secretary
or,
in
the
words
of
the
merrion
court,
receive
specific
general
approval
before
it
could
become
valid.
this
result,
of
course,
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
underlying
enactment
of
the
indian
reorganization
act.
john
collier
explained
that
the
bill
provided
the
machinery
for
progressive
establishment
of
home
rule
by
tribes
or
groups
of
indians.
the
senate
report,
which
was
presided
over
by
senator
wheeler,
the
sponsor
of
the
bill,
the
wheeler-howard
act,
in
the
senate,
explained
that
the
legislation
was
intended,
and
i
quote,
"to
stabilize
the
tribal
organization
of
indian
tribes
by
vesting
them
with
real
though
limited
authority
and
by
prescribing
conditions
which
must
be
met
by
such
tribal
organizations.
"
under
the
interpretation
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
advocated
by
the
ninth
circuit,
those
tribes
which
rejected
the
indian
reorganization
act
would
be
vested
with
not
limited
power
but
with
unlimited
power,
and
that
interpretation
would
encourage
the
majority
of
tribes
in
this
country
who
have
adopted
constitutions
in
pursuance
of
the
objectives
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
to
disband
those
constitutions,
to
repudiate
them,
to
revoke
them.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
yes,
in
fact,
justice
brennan,
the
united
states
points
in
its
brief
that
it
is
now
engaged
in
a
process
of
encouraging
tribes
to
eliminate
the
provisions
in
tribal
constitutions
calling
for
secretarial
review.
apparently
the
notion
is
that
tribal
or
secretarial
review
is
a
matter
that
is
required
by
tribal
law
and
not
by
federal
law.
that
is
the
premise
of
that
argument,
which
i
submit
is
wrong
and
inconsistent
with
this
court's
holding
in
merrion
that
ira
and
adoption
of
a
tribal
constitution
and
secretarial
approval
fulfill
the
administrative
process
established
by
congress
to
monitor
such
exercises
of
tribal
authority.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
is
a
process
which
is
provided
for
in
the
act
itself.
they
certainly
can,
but
if
they
do,
then
they
will
not
bee
following
the
administrative
process
established
by
congress
to
monitor
tribal
exercises,
at
least
of
the
taxing
power,
in
the
event
they
disband
their
constitutions.
in
conclusion,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
rejects
merrion's
interpretation
and
holding
with
respect
to
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
interprets
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
as
an
act
of
congressional
deceit
to
trick
indians
into
contracting
away,
as
the
united
states
has
explained
it,
their
powers
in
the
face
of
representations
that
the
ira
would
strength
their
government
and
free
them
from
federal
control.
the
interpretations
will
encourage
the
majority
of
tribes
who
have
adopted
constitutions
to
repudiate
them.
the
result
is
that
there
will
be
unlimited
exercise
of
absolute
governmental
power,
ironically
on
lands
owned
in
fee
by
the
united
states
government
itself.
we
believe
that
200
years
of
traditional
federal
supervision
over
indian/non-indian
relations
should
be
affirmed.
we
submit
that
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
thank
you.
the
arguments
of
the
respondents
reflect
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
as
to
who
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
and
who
gives
him
authority.
he
is
an
officer
of
the
united
states
government,
and
he
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
supervising
indian
affairs.
he
cannot--
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
--especially
those
affairs
that
concern
relations
between
indians
and
non-indians.
i
appreciate
that
the
court
has
deferred
more
to
indian
tribes
when
they
attempt
or
purport
to
exercise
their
powers
only
with
respect
to
internal
relations
as
opposed
to
matters
that
affect
the
rights
or
interests
of
non-members.
what
the
respondents
are
contending
for
today
is
a
rule
of
law
that
somehow
indian
tribes,
who
are
domestic
dependent
nations,
can
authorize
or
limit
the
powers
of
the
secretary.
i
submit
that
that
is
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
role
of
indian
tribes
and
the
role
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
your
honor,
we
rest
really
on
both,
and
if
i
may
explain
that--
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
--at
the
time
the
ira
was
enacted,
the
only
cases,
the
only
attorney
general
opinions
which
had
ever
considered
the
indian
taxing
powers
were
those
involving
four
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
of
oklahoma.
each
of
these
tribes
had
written
languages
and
written
constitutions,
and
it
is
our
view
that
the
congress
by
enacting
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
meant
to
encourage
all
indian
tribes,
not
just
the
five
civilized
tribes,
to
also
adopt
constitutions,
and
the
congress
also
placed
into
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
the
standard
or
the
notion
of
secretarial
review.
it
is
explicitly
stated,
secretarial
review
of
the
tribal
constitutions.
mr.
alvin
h.
shrago
thank
you.
