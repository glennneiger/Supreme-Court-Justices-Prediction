ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
navajo
tribal
council
enacted
the
broad-based
tax
laws
at
issue
in
this
case
because
it
is
badly
in
need
of
funds
to
provide
essential
governmental
services,
including
police,
fire
protection,
roads,
health
care,
clean
drinking
water,
to
a
reservation
of
over
25,000
square
miles.
these
laws,
like
other
tribal
laws,
were
submitted
in
due
course
to
the
department
of
the
interior,
and
it
was
the
decision
not
of
the
tribe
but
of
the
department
of
the
interior
that
there
was
nothing
in
federal
law,
federal
regulations,
or
tribal
law
which
conditioned
the
effectiveness
of
those
tribal
taxes
on
secretarial
approval.
the
secretarial
has
therefore
repeatedly
and
in
writing
declined
to
act
either
approve
or
disapprove
the
laws
as
he
asserts
that
it
would
be
a
gratuitous
act
of
no
effect.
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
possessory
interest
tax
was
enacted
by
the
navajo
tribal
council,
kerr-mcgee
amended
its
complaint
to
allege
that
the
validity
of
the
taxes
depended
on
secretarial
action.
it
is
important
to
realize
the
scope
of
kerr-mcgee's
allegation.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
but
that
congress,
for
example,
has
power
to
control,
divest,
limit
tribal
taxation.
but
kerr-mcgee
is
alleging
not
just
that
congress
has
delegated
to
the
secretary,
for
example,
the
power
to
regulate
tribal
taxation,
not
just
that
the
secretary
in
the
absence
of
regulation
even
could
veto
a
tribal
ordinance,
but
rather,
that
in
the
absence
of
affirmative
federal
action
which
the
secretary
has
declined
to
take
and
determined
to
be
unnecessary,
a
tribe's
exercise
of
its
own
inherent
sovereign
powers,
powers
which
this
court
has
recognized
to
derive
not
from
the
federal
government
but
from
the
tribe's
sovereignty,
that
the
tribe
may
not
exercise
those
powers,
that
the
exercise
remains
ineffective,
that
the
secretary
cannot
even
waive,
either
deliberately
or
through
lapse
of
time,
such
a
requirement.
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
case
is
that
that
was
not
even
the
case
under
the
jicarilla
apache
constitution,
which,
although
it
does
subject
certain
taxing
laws
to
secretarial
approval,
also
provides
that
if
the
secretary
fails
to
disapprove
a
law
submitted
within
120
days,
the
law
will
become
effective.
other
tribal
constitution
under
the
indian
reorganization
act
specifically
allow
the
secretary
in
his
sole
discretion
in
writing
to
waive
an
approval
requirement.
the
need
for
that
kind
of
certainty
and
that
kind
of
closure
is
a
great
in
tribal
government
as
it
is
anywhere
else.
kerr-mcgee's
argument
would
throw
tribal
government
into
chaos.
it
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
there
may
be
scores
of
tribal
laws
which
have
been
on
the
books
for
decades
now
which
everyone
has
believed
to
be
effective
but
which
according
to
kerr-mcgee
would
be
ineffective
because
there
was
an
approval
requirement
that
was
so
subtle
and
so
implicit
that
the
secretary
didn't
know
that
it
existed,
and
that
the
secretary's
own
determination
that
there
was
no
such
requirement
has
never
sufficed
to
give
effect
to
those
laws.
over
100
years
ago
the
senate
judiciary
committee
upheld
the
validity
of
chickasaw
revenue
ordinances
which
fell
on
non-indians
and
which
had
been
approved
by
no
agent
of
the
federal
government.
in
the
attorney
general
opinion
cited
in
the
united
states'
brief
in
18
opinions
of
the
attorney
general,
it
was...
that
earlier
senate
judiciary
committee
determination
was
not
reaffirmed,
but
the
attorney
general
went
on
to
answer
specifically
the
question,
not
only
were
these
laws
valid,
but
were
they
subject
to
revision
or
control
by
any
department
or
officer
of
the
united
states,
and
concluded
that
they
were
not
because
congress
had
not
delegated
that
power
to
any
agent
or
officer
of
the
united
states.
the
argument
about
tribes
having
been
tricked
into
reorganizing
under
the
indian
reorganization
act
rests
on
a
fundamentally
incorrect
assumption,
which
is
that
if
the
tribe
organized
under
the
indian
reorganization
act,
it
was
required
to
condition
its
laws
in
that
constitution
on
secretarial
approval.
that
has
never
been
the
case.
it
has
never
been
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
law,
nor
did
congress
say
anything
of
the
sort
in
the
indian
reorganization
act.
in
fact,
while
the
act
referred
to
secretarial
approval
with
respect
to
certain
additional
powers
which
were
enumerated
in
the
indian
reorganization
act,
with
respect
to
the
vesting
of
existing
tribal
powers
in
the
tribes
pursuant
to
their
constitutions,
there
was
no
mention
by
congress
whatsoever
of
secretarial
approval.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
it
was
not
the
case
that
all
tribes
did
so.
the
united
states
cites
examples
of
constitutions
going
all
the
way
back
to
1937
which
did
not
contain
such
requirements.
i
believe,
though,
that
the
explanation
is
that
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
enacted
because
there
were
many,
although
not
all,
tribes
which
had
essentially
lost
their
tribal
governments
entirely
during
the
allotment
era.
and
those
tribes
had
very
little
experiences
at
that
point,
anyway,
in
operating
a
government.
those
tribes
were
specifically
in
need
of
additional
guidance
by
the
secretary,
and
as
well
the
approach
of
the
secretary
and
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
tribal
government
at
that
point
was
one
of
exerting
a
great
deal
of
power
over
indian
tribes.
it
may
be
that
the
secretary
carried
that
further
than
congress
wanted
it
to
even
in
the
indian
reorganization
act.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
the
secretary's--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--the
secretary's
position
appears
to
be
that
as
part
of
its
duties
with
respect
to
the
indian
tribes
it
is
willing
to
review
tribal
ordinances
in
the
event
that
that
is
the
tribe's
wish.
the
secretary
takes
the
position
that
if
the
tribe
specifically
conditions
its
laws
on
secretarial
approval,
that
the
secretary
will
review.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
well,
because
there
was
a
provision
in
the
jicarilla
constitution--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--the
tribe
in
that
case,
by
adopting
that
constitution,
was
voluntarily
conditioning
its
own
powers
on
secretarial
approval.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
i
suppose
it
could
be
questioned
whether
the
secretary
ought
to
be
doing
so
even
in
those
cases.
however,
that
is
a
practice
which
the
secretary
has
developed
over
a
long
period
of
time
where
the
tribe
voluntarily
conditions--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--well,
the
secretary
has
recently
issued
guidelines
which
state
what
standards
the
secretary
will
use,
and
the
standard
is
essentially
one
of
seeing
whether
or
not
the
tribal
law
violates
any
other
law,
the
tribal
law...
the
tax
law
in
question--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--but
the
secretary's
authority
is
a
very
different
question.
the
question
of
what
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
do
is
very
different
from
the
question
of
what
the
secretary
is
required
to
do.
even
if
one
assumes
that
congress
has
authorized
the
secretary
in
certain
situations
to
approve
or
disapprove
tribal
law,
that
is
a
far
cry--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--i
think
that
the
question
obviously
doesn't
arise,
at
least
as
between
a
tribe
and
the
secretary,
if
the
tribe
is
willingly
saying--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--in
other
words,
even
if
a
tribe
has
constitution
which
requires
secretarial
approval,
i
think
that
given--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--i
don't
mean
the
question
doesn't
arise.
i
mean
the
dispute
doesn't
arise
if
the
tribe
is
willingly
conditioning
its
laws
on
secretarial
approval.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
we
are
not
questioning
the
secretary's
authority
to
act--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--i
have
not
said
that
express
congressional
statement
is
necessary
in
order
to
empower
the
secretary
to
act
in
those
situations.
i
do
say
that
an
express
direction
of
congress
is
necessary
in
order
to
require
the
secretary
to
act,
that
is,
in
order
to
render
a
tribal
law
ineffective
until
the
secretary
acts.
i
think
that
congress
has
the
power
to
condition
or
limit
tribal
powers
over
and
against
the
desires
of
the
tribe.
the
situation
of
the
tribal
constitution
presents
a
very
different
situation
where
the
secretary's
approval-disapproval
authority
is
not
over
and
against
the
desires
of
the
tribe.
it
is,
in
fact,
with
the
cooperation,
with,
in
fact,
the
tribes's
request
to
the
secretary
for
assistance.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
i
would--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--i
would
question
the
authority
of
the
secretary
in
the
absence
of
a
congressional
delegation
to
veto
a
tribal
ordinance
where
congress
had
not
said
that
tribal
exercise
of
that
kind
of
power
was
conditioned
on
secretarial
approval
or
disapproval.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
no,
that
is
not
the
provision
in
the
constitution.
if
a
tribe
says
in
its
own
constitution,
which
is
tribal
law,
we
are
commissioning
the
effectiveness
of
our
laws
on
secretarial
approval
or
disapproval,
then
that
tribe
is
saying
that
they
will
accept
either
approval
or
disapproval.
they
are
giving
the
secretary
the
power
with
respect
to
their
own
laws.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
no,
they
do
not
have
to
do
so,
and
they
do
not
have
to
do
so
under
the
indian
reorganization
act.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
i
think
that
the
secretary
is
still
functioning
as
an
agent
of
the
united
states,
that
congress
has
delegated
to
the
secretary
the
power
to--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--congress
has
not...
has
never
expressly
stated
that,
so
far
as
i
know,
that
the
secretary
is
to
act
on
tribal
taxing
ordinances
in
any
particular
situation.
on
the
other
hand,
the
secretary
does
have...
it
is
in
the
secretary
that
congress
has
placed
the
management
of
indian
affairs,
but
the
tribe's
point
here
is
that
even
if
that
were
to
go
so...
even
if
that
general...
that
general
authority,
the
fact
that
congress
has
placed
in
the
secretary
the
management
of
indian
affairs,
may
well
be
enough
to
support
the
secretary's
action
as
a
federal
agent
when
a
tribe
specifically
says,
we
want
the
secretary's
action
on
this
law,
we
will
condition
its
effectiveness
on
secretarial
action,
but
it
is--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--well,
it
depends
on
how
the
tribe
has
stated
that
authority.
if
it
is
stated
in
an
indian
reorganization
act
constitution,
then
it
cannot
withdraw
it
by
itself
for
the
simple
reason
that
congress
has
stated
that
those
constitutions
can't
be
amended
without
secretarial
approval.
on
the
other
hand,
the
secretary
is
willingly
encouraging
tribes
to
remove
those
kinds
of
restraints
which
are
not
necessary
under
federal
law.
if
a
tribe
places
that
condition
in
some
other
way,
then,
that
is,
if
it
is
not
in
the
tribe's
constitution,
then
it
may
be
possible
for
the
tribe
or
eliminate
that
condition
as
well
without
further
secretarial
involvement.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
the
leases
are
subject
to
approval
by
the
secretary,
and
i
want
to
specifically
address
the
argument
that
has
been
made
by
kerr-mcgee
that
when
congress
says
to
the
secretary,
you
should
approve
tribal
leases
of
land,
and
of
course...
excuse
me,
that
when
it
says
that,
that
it
means
that
the
secretary
must
approve
or
disapprove
anything
that
the
tribe
does
that
bears
on
those
lessees.
of
course,
this
is...
congress's
direction
to
the
secretary
to
approve
those
kinds
of
leases
first
of
all
is
not
limited
to
mineral
leases.
it
applies
to
other
leases
which
congress
has
enumerated,
for
example,
residential,
religious,
recreational
leases.
second
of
all,
so
that
there
is
no...
it
is
incorrect
to
read
the
direction
to
the
secretary
to
approve
mineral
leases
as
meaning
you,
the
secretary,
must
make
sure
that
tribal
policy
does
not
contravene
federal
energy
or
mineral
policy
any
more
than
congress
intends
to
subject
other
sorts
of
tribal
leases
to
federal
recreational,
religious,
or
residential
policy.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
the
secretary's
regulations
specifically
provide
the
secretary
is
to
be
involved
in
termination
of
leases,
but
the
secretary's
role
under
these
kinds
of
leasing
statutes
is
limited
and
directed
to
proprietary
matters.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
the
case
that
these
laws--
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
--there
is
no
cancellation
of
lease
provision
asserted
in
the
tax
laws.
there
are
other
penalties,
other
enforcement
mechanisms
of
various
sorts,
none
of
which
have
been
imposed
yet.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
i
am
not
sure
of
that,
your
honor.
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
lessees,
well,
not
only
lessees,
just
businesses
that
are
subject
to
these
laws.
we
concede,
for
example,
we
cannot
imprison,
you
know,
kerr-mcgee's
non-indian
employees
while
we
may
be
able
to
imprison
a
navajo
employee
for
tax
fraud.
it
may
also
be
the
case
that
if
it
came
down
to
the
tribe
seizing
and
selling
property,
if
the
tribe
seizes
and
sells
someone's
pickup
truck,
it
does
not
need
secretarial
approval.
if
the
tribe
wants
to
seize
and
sell
a
leasehold,
at
that
point
there
may
be
a
secretarial
approval
requirement
if
the
regulations
so
provide,
but
that...
the
enforcement
mechanisms
are
not
at
issue
at
this
point
because
the
tribe
has
not
attempted
to
enforce
them
against
anybody.
and
those
questions
as
to
what
are
the
federal
limitations
on
any
specific
enforcement
mechanism
can
only
be
answered
when
and
if
the
tribe
needs
to
use
those
enforcement
mechanisms.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
well,
of
course,
they
are,
first
of
all,
ignoring
tribal
forums
entirely,
which
was
exactly
the
remedy
that
was
suggested
in
the
santa
clara
case,
and
i
think
it
is
significant
that
it
is
in
the
indian
civil
rights
act,
not
in
the
mineral
leasing
act
or
in
any
other
law
by
which
the
secretary
is
supposed
to
protect
tribal
property,
it
is
in
the
indian
civil
rights
act
that
congress
has
specifically
directed
itself
to
what
protection
should
persons,
non-indians
or
indian,
within
tribal
jurisdiction
have
from
the
indian
tribes.
and
congress
answered
that
question
in
the
indian
civil
rights
act,
and
that
question
did
not
involve
secretarial
approval
of
tribal
ordinances
as
a
means
of
protecting
it.
ms.
elizabeth
bernstein
no,
they
have
tribal
forums
to
go
to.
the
tax
laws
provide
for
two
levels
of
appeal
within
the
tribal
forums,
and
of
course
if
there
were
other
kinds
of
federal
laws
violated,
they
have
the
same
forum
in
the
federal
courts
that
they
have
in
this
case.
they
keep
referring,
for
example,
to
the
fact
that
the
hopi
ordinances
were
held
to
violate
due
process.
the
due
process
violation
was
not
a
procedural
one
but
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
hopi
tribe
was
asserting
taxing
jurisdiction
beyond
its
territorial
jurisdiction.
that
is
the
kind
of
issue
which
would
readily
be
heard
in
the
federal
courts
to
determine
what
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
an
indian
tribe
is.
but
there
are
certain
kinds
of
violations
which
this
court
has
held
congress
intended
to
be
redressed
in
tribal
forums.
thank
you,
your
honor,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
