mr.
henry
l.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
really
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
this
is
in
reality
an
official
capacity
lawsuit
or
a
lawsuit
against
an
individual,
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
this
is
actually
an
individual
capacity
case.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
clearly
stated
that
this
was
a
suit
against
an
individual
and
not
against
the
city,
and
further
went
on
to
say
that
what
claimants
were
doing
in
effect
was
attempting
to
amend
their
complaint
at
this
stage
to
include
the
city
under
the
guise
that
it
was
an
official
capacity
lawsuit.
the
court
recognized
that--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--the
district
court
said
that
in
dealing
with
the
question,
and
as
they
commented,
the
sole
issue
is
whether
director
chapman
should
have
known
about
the
dangerous
propensities
of
the
officer
in
question,
that
in
dealing
with
that,
they
concluded--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--if
your
honor
please,
this
in
the--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
on
page
20a.
the
court
says
both
parties
to
the
case
agreed
that
mr.
chapman
had
no
actual
knowledge
of
officer
allen's
dangerous
propensities.
thus,
they
said
that
the
sole
issue
was
whether
director
chapman
should
have
known,
not
knew,
but
should
have
known
that
officer
allen's
dangerous
propensities
created
a
threat
to
the
rights
and
safety
of
other
citizens.
that
was
determined
by
the
district
court
as
to
be
the
ground
rules
or
the
framework
under
which
this
case
was
to
be
tried,
and
that
is
the
way
it
was
tried.
now,
counsel
argues
that
there
is
discussion
about
various
policies
that
were
in
effect,
but
it
is
obvious...
at
least
it
is
our
contention
that
it
is
obvious
in
a
reading
of
the
district
court's
opinion
that
what
they
were
doing
was
really
directing
everything
to
that
one
question,
and
that
is,
whether
or
not--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--because
mr.
chapman
as
police
director
should
have
known
of
officer
allen's
dangerous
propensities,
the
courts
find
that
he
must
be
held
liable
in
his
official
capacity
to
the
complainants.
but
the
problem
there,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
that
is
really
an
inconsistent
finding,
because
if
the
only
question
is
whether
he
should
have
known,
this
is
obviously
a
negligence
type
question,
not
a
monell
type
question.
nothing
ever
came
into
play
in
the
district
court's
findings
with
regard
to
monell.
no
reference
whatsoever.
no
reference
to
the
monell
standards.
that
is
the
part
about
the
district
court's
opinion
that
becomes
a
little
bit
confusing,
because
on
the
one
hand
you
are
dealing
with
the
issue
of
should
have
known,
which
we
submit
is
clearly
nothing
more
than
a
negligence
issue,
and
then
on
the
other
hand
it
is
finding
him
liable
in
his
official
capacity,
and
as
we
read
the
law,
there
would
be
no
way
under
a
simple
negligence
finding
that
he
could
be
liable
in
his
official
capacity.
but
in
any
event,
the
court
did,
as
your
honor
points
out,
the
court
did
make
such
a
finding,
but
then
when
it
got
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
obvious
that
they
considered
it
nothing
more
than
a
negligence
type
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
were
any
dangerous
propensities
or
he
should
have
known,
but
then
went
further
to
say
that
in
that
this
is
just
a
case
against
the
city...
or
against
the
individual,
and
not
against
the
city,
that
the
director
was
entitled
to
good
faith
immunity.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
he
was
represented
by
me,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
it
would.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
that
is
done...
that
is
done
quite
frequently,
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
that
i
can
state
where
i
have
as...
my
official
title
is
staff
attorney
for
the
city
of
memphis...
where
i
have
represented--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well,
that
came
about,
the
plaintiffs,
and
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
that
came
about
after
the
case
was
up
on
appeal,
and
before
the
court
of
appeals.
then
they
filed
a
motion
to
substitute.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
no,
i
did
not--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
in
our...
when
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
our
whole
argument
was
based
on
the
fact
that
this
was
an
individual
capacity
lawsuit,
and
we
felt
like
we
made
it
clear
to
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
time
that
it
was
only
being
treated
in
this
way,
and
that
we
were
entitled
to
good
faith
immunity,
and
also
the
question
about
the
standard
which
was
to
be
imposed,
but
we
did
not
officially
object
to
that,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
is--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--the
fact
that
we
did
not
object?
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well,
the
fact
that
we
did
not
object
i
don't
think
was
inconsistent
with
what
we
were
trying
to
do
or
what
our
theory
was.
there
could
be
no
question
before
the
court
of
appeals
what
our
theory
was.
and
frankly,
we
did...
i
say
ignore.
we
did
not
respond.
that's
true.
but
we
did
not
consider
that
that
had
any
merit,
because
it
didn't
apply
or
should
not
apply
in
an
individual
capacity
case.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
mr.--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--not...
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
treat
him
as
having
been
removed,
because
a
reading
of...
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
talks
about
director
chapman
throughout,
and
never
makes
any
reference
to
director
holt.
of
course,
what
had
happened
was,
chapman
had
left
office,
and
director
holt
had
been
appointed
by
the
mayor,
and
that
is
when
this
attempted
substitution
was
filed.
but
a
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
clearly
shows
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
consider
that
director
holt
was
in
the
picture
because
they
considered
that
it
was
an
action
individually
against
director
chapman,
and
so
stated.
so,
they
didn't
pay,
so
to
speak,
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
had
been
this
proposed
substitution.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
henry
l.
klein
no,
sir,
i
was
still
representing
director
chapman.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
no,
your
honor,
only
director
chapman,
and
only
represented
director
chapman--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--well,
that's
the--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--well,
we
say
that
he's
not,
your
honor.
that's
a
question.
but
our
position
is,
he's
not
out
of
the
case,
and
never
has
been
out
of
the
case,
because
he
was
sued
individually.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
henry
l.
klein
if
your
honor
please,
our
contention
is
that
the
only
true
appellee
in
this
case
is
director
chapman.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
i
am
in
effect
representing
director
chapman.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well,
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
no
one
else
is
before
the
court.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well,
private
litigant,
although
he
was--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--well,
in
this
particular
case
he
would
be
a
private
litigant,
although
at
the
time--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--he
would
be
a
private
litigant.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
sir.
now,
again,
from
an
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
what
is
clear
is
that
they
were
dealing
with
only
one
issue,
and
that
was
whether
or
not
there
was
any
liability
on
the
part
of
director
chapman,
and
we
say
individually,
and
the
standard
that
should
be
applied
to
determine
that
liability.
the
court
comments
that
the
parties
in
the
case
expended
considerable
energy
either
relying
on
or
distinguishing
in
their
opinion
an
opinion
in
the
case
of
hayes
versus
jefferson
county,
and
that
was
a
sixth
circuit
case
that
applied
the
applicable
standards.
the
question
was
whether
the
standard
in
peratt
v.
taylor
would
apply
or
whether
a
greater
degree
of
negligence
should
be
applied.
and
by
the
fact
that
both
parties
were
spending
a
considerable
amount
of
time
addressing
themselves
to
that
issue,
it
was
obvious
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
only
issue
that
was
before
them
was
one...
a
question
of
negligence,
and
not
a
question
of
policy
under
the
monell
standard.
and
as
i
say,
they
go
ahead
to
find
that
in
reality,
the
plaintiffs
are
attempting
to
amend
their
complaint
so
as
to
treat
the
police
director
as
though
he
were
the
city
in
order
to
provide
the
qualified
immunity
which
shields
director
chapman.
nothing
was
ever
referred
to,
no
mention
was
ever
made
of
any
monell
standards
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
case
started
out
clearly
as
a
case
against
director
chapman,
without
any
reference
to
it
being
an
official
capacity
lawsuit.
there
was
any
attempt
to
bring
the
city
in.
there
was
never
any
attempt
to
amend
to
bring
the
city
in,
which
they
clearly
could
have
done.
and
even
though
this
case
was
filed
before
monell
was
decided,
the
sixth
circuit
in
various
opinions
had
held
that
the
city
could
be
brought
in
under
section
1331
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
no
attempt
was
ever
made
to
bring
the
city
in.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
i
would
agree
that
that
is
what
the
cases...
that
is
what
the
cases
seem
to
hold.
but
the
problem
is--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--if
it
were
an
official
capacity
suit.
that
is
what
the
cases
have
held,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
but
since
this
was
not
done,
it
is
our
position
it
was
clearly
tried
as
an
individual
capacity
lawsuit.
interestingly
enough,
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed
pretrial,
and
at
that
time
there
were
three
defendants
in
the
case.
there
was
officer
allen,
and
there
was
the
mayor,
and
there
was
the
police
director,
chapman.
and
the
court
dismissed
the
mayor
on
the
grounds
that
he
did
not
actively
participate
in
the
acts
that
were
involved,
and
as
a
supervisory
personnel,
there
was
nothing
to
establish
any
liability
on
his
part,
and
considered
very
carefully
whether
or
not
director
chapman
should
have
been
dismissed,
and
then
finally
concluded
that
because
through
discovery
there
were
two
letters
that
were
found
that
may
indicate
that
he
may
have
known
something
about
this
individual
officer,
the
court
declined,
on
that
basis
and
that
basis
alone,
the
court
declined
to
grant
the
summary
judgment,
and
said
that
there
may
be
some
genuine
issue
as
to
whether
director
chapman
knew
or
should
have
known
about
the
danger.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
your
honor,
i
was.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
no,
your
honor,
there
was
not.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
we
were
aware
that
the
case
had
been
decided,
but
it
was
clearly
established
that
the
sole
issue
was
whether
or
not
director
chapman
should
have
known
about
the
dangerous
propensities,
which
we--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--no
discussion.
now,
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
did
say
that
they
were
contending,
and
this
was
at
the
trial
and
opening
statement,
that
they
did
contend
that
monell
was
the
same,
in
this
instance
would
be
the
same
as
a
suit
against
the
entity
itself
under
the
holding
of
monell.
but
with
regard
to
the
standards
under
which
the
case
was
tried,
there
was
never
any
discussion
about
monell
standards,
and
of
course,
again--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--no,
your
honor,
because
we
felt
like...
we
felt
like
that
was
the
appropriate
standard.
that's
the
way
the
case
was
brought.
that's
the
way
it
was
framed.
and
quite
frankly,
that's
the
way
it
was
tried
on
the
question
of
whether
he
should
have
known.
nothing
about...
nothing
about
monell.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well,
your
honor,
what
they
did,
they
made
their
findings
based
upon
good
faith,
and
what
the
court
said,
and
they
said
the
record
was
clear
that,
number
one,
he
knew
nothing
about
officer
allen,
including
his
instability,
that
he
had
only
assumed
his
office
six
months
prior
to
the
occurrence
of
this
incident,
that
at
the
time
he
was
in
the
process
of
instituting
significant
changes
to
stop
police
brutality
in
memphis--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--that's
what
they're
saying.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
sir.
the
district
court
said
that.
but
the
court
of
appeals
disagrees.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
they
don't
say
anything
about
them
being
erroneous
other
than
the
fact
than
they
say
the
district
court
failed
to
consider
the
good
faith
immunity
defense,
and
that
based
on
what
was
in
this
record,
it
was
clear
that
what
officer
or
director
chapman
has
been
doing
in
the
six
months
that
he
had
been
in
office
was
trying
to
effect
changes
to
correct
whatever
problems
existed.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well,
we
say
that
he
should
not
have
known,
and
of
course
that's
what
we
argued
down
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
we
lost--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--the
the
precise
issue
of
whether...
not
whether
he
knew--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--but
whether
he
should
have
known.
yes,
sir.
we
lost
that
precise
issue.
and
we
could
contend,
and
i
could,
of
course,
go
back
over
the
facts...
i
won't
reargue
the
case--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--but
we
contended
that--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--what
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
henry
l.
klein
that's
a
question,
i
would
say,
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well,
conceivably
it
could
be.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
that's--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--that's
correct.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well,
the
way
i
get
away
from
it,
your
honor,
is
because
of
the
standard
which
should
be
applied
under
monell.
the
fact
that
he
was
acting
in
his
official
capacity,
and
there
are
many
cases
which
i
am
sure
your
honor
is
fully
familiar
with
where
we
deal
with
individuals
acting
in
their
official
capacity
in
the
operation
of
whatever
it
may
be,
school
board,
police
department,
or
what
have
you,
and
there
can
be
no
question
that
he
was
acting
in
that
role.
he
wasn't
acting
as
just
an
individual
off
the
street.
of
course
not.
he
was
acting
in
his
official
capacity.
but
the
standards
that
have
to
be
applied
are
entirely
different,
we
contend,
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
he
would
be
liable
in
his
individual
and
liable
in
his
official
capacity,
and
the
only
way
that
he
could
be
liable
in
his
official
capacity
would
be
under
the
monell
standards,
whereas
he
is
the
alter
ego
of
the
police
department.
the
police
department
obviously
can't
function
without
its
representatives,
and
he,
of
course,
stands
in
that
position,
and
anything
that
he
does,
of
course,
does
represent
the
police
department.
but
in
order
to
hold
the
police
department
liable
or
the
city
liable
in
this
circumstance,
we
would
have
to,
as
we
say,
apply
the
monell
standards.
but
i
cannot
say
that
he
wasn't
acting
in
his...
in
an
official
capacity,
but
i
think
it
is
quite
common
that
suits
against
officials,
whether
they
be
individual
or
in
his
official
capacity,
he
was
certainly
acting
as
school
board
member,
or
as
an
officer
of
the
state,
or
as
a
member
of
the
police
department.
but
the
fact
that
whether
he
is
individually
liable
or
liable
in
his
official
capacity
really
brings
into
play
two
different
standards,
and
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
liability
or
at
least
suing
him
in
his
official
capacity
is
just
another
way
of
suing
the
entity
itself,
we
submit
that
the
monell
standards
would
have
to
apply,
and
not
the
typical
negligence
standards
which
apply
in
cases
against
individuals
who,
although
are
acting
in
a
so-called
official
capacity,
but
who
would
be
liable
individually
rather
than
as
a
representative
of
the
city.
as
i
mentioned,
the
court
preliminarily
came
very
close
to
dismissing
director
chapman
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
it
was
obvious
at
this
point
that
the
court
was
only
considering
director
chapman
in
his
individual
capacity.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
sir,
it
is.
there
is
the--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--if
your
honor
please,
in
the
appendix
there
is
a
reference
to
the
order
granting
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
in
denying
the
summary
judgment
as
to
director
chapman,
the
court
said
that
it
was
denied,
but
granted
leave
to
file
a
renewed
motion
for
summary
judgment
if
additional
discovery
shows
that
there
was
no
actual
or
genuine
issue
as
to
chapman's
lack
of
knowledge.
so,
when
we
say
close,
if
your
honor
please,
what
we
are
saying
is,
the
court
was
giving
very
careful
consideration
to
whether
there
was
even
enough
in
the
case
to
hold
director
chapman
liable
based
on
what
he
knew
or
should
have
known,
and
did
grant
leave
to
file
a
renewed
motion
on
that
one
point.
but
again,
what
we
are
saying
is,
it
was
clear
that
the
only
thing
that
was
being
considered
was
chapman
as
an
individual,
and
not
in
an
official
capacity,
which
would
be
another
way
of
holding
the
city
in.
the
findings
of
the
court,
the
district
court,
with
regard
to
the
liability
of
director
chapman,
as
i
have
stated
previously,
do
not
meet
the
monell
standards,
and
the
court
talks
about,
for
example,
unjustified
inaction.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
if
they
did
meet
the
monell
standards?
mr.
henry
l.
klein
that
would
make
the
city
liable.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
no,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well,
i
am
representing
him
because
it
is
our
contention
the
city
is
not
involved,
never
has
been
involved,
was
never
brought
in,
was
never
served
with
process,
was
never
required
to
answer.
there
was
never
an
amendment
to
bring
the
city
in.
there
was
never
an
amendment
to
try
this
lawsuit
under
monell
standards,
and
it
is
our
position
that
we
are
here
in
behalf
of
director
chapman.
but
in
response
to
your
question,
if
the
monell
standards
applied
and
the
city
were
found
to
be
liable,
it
is
our
position
there
would
be
no
liability
as
to
director
chapman.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
henry
l.
klein
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well--
0
[generallaughter.]
i
would
use
the
expression,
i
am
sort
of
put
between
the
rock
and
the
hard
place
with
regard
to
this
particular
situation,
but
yes,
we
think
he
needs
to
be
represented,
because
he
is
the
only
one
in
the
lawsuit
at
this
particular
juncture,
and
that
is
the
problem
that
we
perceive
with
these
official
capacity
lawsuits
as
trying
to
distinguish
them
from
individual
capacity
lawsuits.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
no.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
no,
sir.
there
was
a
finding,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
damages,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
with
regard
to
whether
the
city
has
undertaken
to--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--the
finding
with
regard
to
damages
was
that
director
chapman,
i
believe,
was
responsible
for
approximately
$26,000.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
that's--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--yes,
your
honor,
they
would--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
sued
in
his
official
capacity.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
well,
to
that
extent,
but,
your
honor,
again,
this
is
the
point
i
was
making
before.
that's
the
confusion
and
inconsistency
with
the
case.
when
you
look
at
the
standard
on
which
it
was
actually
tried,
whether
he
should
have
known,
which
is
clearly
not
an
official
capacity,
official
policy
case,
and
then
the
district
court's
conclusion
that,
yes,
he
was
found
liable
in
his
official
capacity,
that's
where
the
inconsistency
comes,
and
that's
where
the
confusion
comes.
and
of
course
if
the
city
had
been
brought
in
initially,
then
a
lot
of
this
would
have
been
avoided,
but
unfortunately
that
wasn't--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--not...
you
mean
before
court?
mr.
henry
l.
klein
no,
your
honor,
we
didn't,
did
not.
mr.
henry
l.
klein
should
have
known
of
his
propensities
before.
in
other
words,
the
idea
or
the
theory
was
that
if
they
knew
about
his
dangerous
propensities,
some
action
would
have
been
taken,
hopefully,
to
either
reassign
him
or--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--well,
that's
hard
to
read
into
what
the
district
court
is
saying.
they
do
talk
at
one
point
about
a
policy,
but
we
always
get
back
to
the
threshold--
mr.
henry
l.
klein
--well,
my
theory
of
the
defense
was
that
it
was
strictly
a
negligence
question
whether
he
should
have
known,
and
of
course
our
whole
effort
was
directed
toward
showing
that
there
was
really
no
way
that
he
would
have
known,
not
having
come
and
been
there
for
the
short
period
of
time,
and
that
he
was
trying
to
implement
new
policies,
trying
to
make
changes,
but
that
it
was
almost
as
if
they
expected
that
he
went
back
and
read
every
file
on
every...
on
some
1,250
or
1,275
police
officers
to
determine
who
was
good
and
who
was
bad.
it
was
our
argument
that
the
law
just
didn't
impose
that
standard
on
him.
thank
you.
