justice
stevens
mr.
schnapper,
is
it
not
correct
that
those
policies
in
the
district
court's
finding
merely
were
to
establish
the
proposition
that
chapman
should
have
known
about
this
officer's
propensities,
rather
than
saying
that
the
policies
were
what
actually
caused
the
injury.
that
is
the
way
one
might
read
the
conclusions
of
law.
justice
stevens
well,
i
am
not
sure...
well,
you
say
and
the
lack
of
knowledge
caused
the
assault?
it
doesn't
go
that...
the
district
court
i'm
not
sure
said
that.
i
thought
he
more
or
less
held
him
liable
on
a
respondeat
superior
theory
and
explained
why
he
should
have
known
of
the
propensities
of
the
officer.
justice
stevens
mr.
klein,
on
that
point,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
good
faith
defense
was
available
because
chapman
neither
knew
nor
should
have
known
of
the
misconduct,
and
i
don't
understand
how
they
did
that
in
view
of...
maybe
this
is
beyond
the
question
presented,
but
in
view
of
the
unequivocal
finding
in
the
district
court
that
chapman
should
have
known.
how
do
you
reconcile
that?
justice
stevens
i
understand
all
that,
but
still,
is
it
not
correct
that
the
district
court
did
squarely
say
that
in
view
of
the
various
policies
that
your
opponent
has
discussed,
the
code
of
silence
and
all
the
rest,
that
he
in
fact
should
have
known.
justice
stevens
that's
what
the
district
court
said.
justice
stevens
they
don't
say
the
finding
was
clearly
erroneous.
in
fact,
they
don't
even
acknowledge
that
the
district
court
made
such
a
finding.
justice
stevens
how
do
we
take
the
record?
should
he
or
should
he
not
have
known
of
the
misconduct
of
the
officer?
justice
stevens
and
you
lost
before
the
district
court--
justice
stevens
--on
that
precise
issue.
justice
stevens
but
should
have
known.
justice
stevens
no.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
was
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law,
whether
he
should
have
known?
justice
stevens
the
question
whether
chapman
should
have
known
of
the
officer's
misconduct.
is
that
a
question
of
fact?
justice
stevens
mr.
klein,
am
i
correct
or
is
this
just
something
in
the
briefs,
or
is
it
in
the
record
that
the
city
has
undertaken
to
obey
any
judgment
of
the
district
judge?
justice
stevens
that
is
not
in
the
record?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
finding
with
regard
to
damages?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see,
it
is
the
amount
of
damages.
justice
stevens
yes,
i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
should
have
known
finding?
was
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
the
supervisor
should
have
known
of
the
incident
after
it
happened,
or
that
he
should
have
known
of
the
officer's
propensities
even
before
the
incident?
justice
stevens
and
that
with
such
knowledge,
it
would
have
been
the
equivalent
of
a
policy
to
employ
such
an
individual?
justice
stevens
if
you
don't
read
that
in,
i
can't
understand
why
you
wouldn't
have
raised
more
monell
issues,
so
that
is
why
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
what
your
theory
of
the
defense
was.
