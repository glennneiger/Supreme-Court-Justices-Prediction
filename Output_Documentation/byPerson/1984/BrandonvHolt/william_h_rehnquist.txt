rehnquist
well,
something
would
depend,
wouldn't
it,
mr.
schnapper,
on
how
the
case
was
tried,
the
theory
on
which
he
was
tried?
justice
rehnquist
well,
particularly
when
the
case
was
tried
before
monell
was
decided,
or
rather,
the
complaint
was
filed
before
monell
was
decided,
so
you
have
a
fairly
ambiguous
situation,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
rehnquist
why
didn't
you
move
to
amend
your
complaint?
justice
rehnquist
but
ordinarily
a
prudent
lawyer
wanting
a
judgment
against
a
city
would
be
fairly
certain
to
make
sure
the
city
was
named
defendant
if
the
city
were
suable,
i
would
think.
you
wouldn't
rely
on
a
provision
in
the
rules
that
you
thought
might
justify
an
argument
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
that
perhaps
the
court
would
rule
for
you
on
the
point.
justice
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
their
actions
are
official
policies.
a
policy
certainly
means
more
than
just
the
action
of
a
particular
individual.
justice
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
say
exactly
what
the
constitutional
violation
was
here?
justice
rehnquist
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
find
one,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
to
say
that
the
same
standard
applies
doesn't
mean
that
the
two
are
the
same
thing.
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
you
were
citing
cases
to
say
that
we
have
already
decided
precisely
this
question,
and
you
say
that
in
the
first
case
we
said
that
the
same
standard
would
apply
in
a
suit
against
a
city
as
in
a
suit
against
an
officer
in
his
official
capacity.
one
can
subscribe
to
that
view
without
in
any
way
subscribing
to
the
view
that
the
two
are
identical
so
far
as
imposing
liability
is
concerned.
justice
rehnquist
does
the
committee
language
indicate
any
thought
that
the
rule
applies
beyond
injunctive
suits?
