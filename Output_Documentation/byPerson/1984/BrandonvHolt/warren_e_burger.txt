we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
brandon
against
holt.
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready,
mr.
schnapper.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
burger
isn't
that
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law?
chief
justice
burger
well,
as
soon
as
they
invoked
the
idea
that
chapman
should
have
known,
it
could
only
have
been
in
his
official
capacity.
could
it
be
in
any
other
way?
chief
justice
burger
why
should
he
have
to
know
the
propensities
of
a
dangerous
policeman
except
in
his
capacity
as
an
official
of
the
city?
chief
justice
burger
directly
in
charge.
chief
justice
burger
how
do
you
get
away
from
this
being
an
official
capacity
case
under
monell?
chief
justice
burger
i
think
you
responded
to
someone
but
i
don't
recall
your
response.
were
you
in
the
case
from
the
outset?
chief
justice
burger
yes.
chief
justice
burger
that's
what
i
understood.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
