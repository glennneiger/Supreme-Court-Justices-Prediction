how
do
you
know
they
knew?
justice
white
in
court.
justice
white
was
the
city
a
party?
was
the
city
a
party
to
that
case?
justice
white
but
except
for
this
rule,
except
for
this
rule
you
rely
on,
which...
except
for
that
rule,
the
city
would
not
have
been
bound
by
the
judgment?
it
wasn't
a
party,
and
it
wasn't
served.
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
the
issue
of
policy.
justice
white
so
that
you
could
still
lose
this
case
back
in
the
court
of
appeals,
even
if
we
agreed
with
you
now.
justice
white
well,
he
certainly
didn't
articulate
any...
articulate
his
ruling
in
terms
of
the
city's
liability
under
monell.
justice
white
yes,
but
he
didn't
say,
now,
i
am
going
to
identify
a
city
policy.
certainly
there
wasn't
any
city
policy
to
have...
to
encourage
officers
to
go
around
and
act
the
way
this
officer
did.
justice
white
they
didn't
train
them
to
do
it,
for
example.
justice
white
well,
at
the
very
least,
you
do
pose
a
question
of
what
does
"policy"
mean
under
monell.
justice
white
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
what
did
the
district
court
say?
justice
white
excuse
me.
what
page
of
the
appendix
are
you
or?
justice
white
petition?
