justice
o'connor
--mr.
schnapper--
justice
o'connor
--when
this
action
went
to
trial,
it
apparently
was
tried
and
liability
was
found
on
the
basis
of
whether
officer
chapman
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
dangerous
propensities
of
the
other
officer.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
is
that
the
theory?
justice
o'connor
is
that
what
the
district
court
found
as
the
basis
for
liability?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
that
finding
alone
is
even
appropriate
under
the
monell
standard
for
liability
in
an
official
capacity
suit?
justice
o'connor
i
just
didn't
see
anything
at
all
in
monell
to
that
effect.
it
seemed
to
me
that
maybe
what
had
to
be
found
was
whether
it
was
an
official
policy
or
practice
of
the
department
or
city.
justice
o'connor
well,
if
it
turns
out
that
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
that
what
has
to
be
established
for
an
official
capacity
suit
is
whether
it
was
an
official
policy
or
practice
of
the
department
or
city,
would
it
have
to
be
sent
back
then
for
a
new
trial?
justice
o'connor
mr.
klein--
justice
o'connor
--was
officer
chapman
represented
in
the
district
court
by
the
city
attorney?
justice
o'connor
and
would
that
be
the
normal
procedure
in
an
individual
capacity
suit?
justice
o'connor
would
the
city
step
in
and
representing
the
officer?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
there
normally
would
be
an
automatic
substitution
of
parties
in
an
individual
capacity
suit
wherein
officer
holt
was
substituted
for
officer
chapman
if
it
is
an
individual
action?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
did
that
come
about?
justice
o'connor
did
you
object
to
that
substitution--
justice
o'connor
--and
why
not,
if
you
thought
it
was
an
individual
capacity
suit?
justice
o'connor
that
is
a
bit
inconsistent
with
your
theory,
is
it
not?
justice
o'connor
chapman,
you
mean?
chapman.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
if
there
were
an
official
capacity
suit
which
had
been
brought
against
director
chapman
and
liability
was
found,
the
city
would
be
liable,
whether
or
not
it
was
named.
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
o'connor
so
it
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
to
amend
to
bring
the
city
in
as
a
named
party
in
order
to
impose
liability
if
it
were
an
official
capacity
suit?
justice
o'connor
mr.
klein,
were
you
involved
at
the
trial
stage?
justice
o'connor
was
there
ever
any
discussion
by
counsel
with
the
court
about
monell
and
what
was
required
under
that?
justice
o'connor
you
just
weren't
aware
that
that
case
had
been
decided?
justice
o'connor
there
was
no
discussion
about
what
the
proper
standard
would
be?
justice
o'connor
and
you
never
objected
to
the
standard
that
was
being
employed?
justice
o'connor
mr.
klein,
are
punitive
damages
available
in
an
individual
capacity
suit
if
the
facts
warrant
it--
justice
o'connor
--against
someone
in
an
individual
capacity...
sued
in
their
individual
capacity?
justice
o'connor
but
the
court,
the
district
court
below
determined
that
no
punitive
damages
could
be
awarded
against
director
chapman,
did
it
not?
justice
o'connor
since
he
was
sued
as
the
director
of
the
police
department.
justice
o'connor
so
that
does
look
like
at
least
to
that
extent
it
was
tried
as
an
official
capacity
suit?
justice
o'connor
did
you
cross-petition?
i
can't
recall.
did
you
cross-petition
for
chapman
on
the
theory
that
if
in
fact
it
were
an
official
capacity
suit,
that
the
standard
below
was
the
wrong
one?
justice
o'connor
up
here.
