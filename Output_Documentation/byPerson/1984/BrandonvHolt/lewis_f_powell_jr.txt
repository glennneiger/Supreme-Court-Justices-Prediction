justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
jr.
assume
for
the
moment
that
they
did
meet
the
monell
standards.
what
would
be
the
effect
on
your
client,
mr.
chapman?
justice
jr.
yes.
that
would
make
the
city
liable?
justice
jr.
would
mr.
chapman
still
be
liable?
justice
jr.
well,
are
you
representing
him
or
the
city
here?
justice
jr.
would
he
win
either
way
this
case
goes?
justice
jr.
would
monell
win
either
way?
sorry.
would
chapman
win
either
way
this
case
goes?
if
he
is
viewed
as
liable
personally,
then
it
was
found
that
he
had
good
faith
immunity.
justice
jr.
if
we
rule
that
monell
applies
and
he
acted
only
in
official
capacity,
he
would
be
out
then
also,
wouldn't
he?
justice
jr.
so
he
doesn't
need
counsel
here,
does
he?
