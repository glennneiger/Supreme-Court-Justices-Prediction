mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
neither
complex
nor
novel.
the
issue,
simply
put,
is
whether
a
judgment
against
a
public
official
in
his
official
capacity
runs
against
the
official
personally
or
against
the
entity
for
which
the
official
works.
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
that
the
director
of
the
police
department
in
memphis
was
liable
in
his
official
capacity.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded...
i
think
this
is
maybe
best
cast
as
a
construction
of
what
such
a
judgment
would
mean...
that
a
judgment
against
an
official
in
his
official
capacity
runs
against
the
official
personally,
not
against
the
entity
of
which
he
is
an
employee.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
this
regard.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
there
are...
that
would
be
a
somewhat
different
question.
the
first
issue
is,
if
we
have
a
judgment
against
the
official
in
his
official
capacity,
assuming
that
judgment
was
correctly
entered,
who
has
to
pay.
the
second
question,
i
think,
encompassed
within
your
own
is,
might
such
a
judgment
be
improper
because
of
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
way
it
was
tried.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
don't
think
we
have
an
ambiguous
situation
as
of
the
time
the
case
went
to
trial
or
even
as
of
19
months
before
that.
as
i
indicated,
19
months
before
trial,
we
filed
a
memorandum
in
the
district
court
making
crystal
clear
that
we
sought
to
impose
liability
on
the
defendant
only
in
his
official
capacity,
and
noted
that
this
court's
decision
in
monell
had
held
that
an
official
capacity
judgment
ran
against
the
entity.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
on
our
reading
of
the
federal
rules,
no
such
amendment
was
necessary.
the
defendant
was
certainly
on
notice
as
to
what
we
were
trying
to
do
and
on
whom
the
liability
would
be
imposed.
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
rules
as
they
now
stand
that
requires
that
notice
be
in
the
complaint.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
had
decided
the
issue
twice
by
1979,
both
in
our
favor.
all
the
courts
of
appeals
had
concluded
that
rule
25(d)
means
what
it
says
on
its
face,
that
a
judgment
against
an
official
in
his
official
capacity
is
a
judgment
against
the
entity.
i
don't
disagree
that
we
would
have
avoided
a
trip
to
washington
had
we
amended
the
complaint
in
that
way,
but
in
our
view
the
trip
should
have
been
unnecessary,
and
the
rules
mean
what
they
say.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
it
may
more
reasonably
be
cast
as
a
lesson
about--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
i
think
that
the
federal
rules
don't
require
the
notice
at
issue
to
have
been
in
any
particular
form
as
long
as
the
defendants
had
actual
notices
to
the
entity
against
which
the
judgment
would
run,
and
they
certainly
had
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
city.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
filed
a
memorandum
in
february
of
1979.
mr.
eric
schnapper
in
court.
expressed
this--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--the
city's
lawyer
was
representing
the
defendant
at
that
point.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
prior
to
the
existence
of
rule
25(d)
and
its
predecessor
under
the
1937
rules
of
federal
civil
procedure,
there
were
lawsuits
against
officials
in
their
official
capacity.
there
was
an
enormous
amount
of
confusion
as
to
just
what
that
meant,
and
rule
25(d)
was
meant
to
clear
that
up.
but
i
would
argue
were
we
now
standing
and
arguing
this
in
1936,
that
the
result
would
be
the
same.
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
argument,
however.
but
the
notion,
the
concept
of
official
capacity
lawsuits
has
been
around
for
quite
some
time,
going
back
well
into
the
previous
century.
in
any
event--
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that
is
not
the
only
theory
of
liability.
we
indicated
at
the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
that
is
one
of
the
findings
it
made.
it
made
several
specific
findings
with
regard
to
city
practices.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think,
your
honor,
it
would
depend
on
who
the
official
was
that
knew
or
should
have
known.
there
are
some
officials--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
specific
findings
with
regard
to
practices
that
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
in
a
second,
but
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
a
finding
that
an
official
knew
or
should
have
known
about
the
sort
of
aberrant
policeman
at
issue
here,
monell
refers
not
merely
to
policies
but
to
acts.
there
are
some
natural
persons
within
any
governmental
unit
whose
actions
are
official
actions,
and
i
think
that
while--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
think
that
monell
refers
to
actions
and
decisions
as
well
as
policies.
i
mean,
there
are
any
number
of
decisions
that
have
to
get
made
in
a
given
case
which
aren't
policies
that
affect
a
lot
of
cases.
they
are
just
decisions
on
a
particular
situation.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
we
do
have
a
number
of
very
specific
findings
of
governmental
practices
here
set
out
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
there
was
a
finding
that
it
was
the
policy
of
the
department
never
to
fire
a
violent
officer,
not
to
transfer
officers
for
disciplinary
reasons.
there
is
a
finding
that
it
was
the
policy
of
the
director
of
the
department
to
insulate
himself
from
knowledge
of
any
abuses
by
officials,
and
there
is
also
a
finding
of
what
i
think
is
clearly
a
custom
within
the
meaning
of
monell,
a
code
of
silence
among
all
the
officers
involved
not
to
disclose
what
abuses
might
be
going
on
within
the
department.
we
think
those
findings
are
sufficient
to
meet
the
monell
standards,
and
they
are
express
findings.
this
is
not
a
case
like
wainwright
against
witt.
we
aren't
arguing
that
just
because
we
won
in
the
district
court,
the
court
should
presume
there
must
have
been
some
unstated
findings
in
our
favor.
we
think
that
rule
52,
like
section
2254,
refers
to
real
live
written
or
oral
findings,
but
we
have
those
here.
and
we
think
they
are
entirely
sufficient.
indeed,
they
are
considerably
more
specific
in
detail
than
are
present
in
ordinary
monell
cases.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
and
i
don't
mean
by
my
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
to
suggest
that
that
is
an
issue
that
ought
to
be
addressed
here.
it,
like
the
problem
of
peratt
against
taylor,
was
not
raised
at
the
trial
court,
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
probably
can't
be
raised
at
this
stage
in
the
litigation
in
any
event,
but
certainly
if
it
can
be
raised
it
ought
to
be
looked
at
in
the
first
instance
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
the
only
thing
that
is
properly
addressed
by
this
court
is
whether
the
judgment
that
we
won,
assuming
it
was
correct,
ran
against
the
city.
we
are
delighted
to
win
this
case
at
any
time
on
any
issue
in
any
forum,
but
i
am
constrained
to
acknowledge
that,
as
mr.
justice
white
suggests,
under
the
ordinary
practice
of
this
court,
the
monell
issues
are
issues
which
should
be
dealt
with
in
the
first
instance
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
specific
events
which
gave
rise
to
liability
in
this
case
are
set
out
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
the
most
important
finding
with
regard
to
that
incident
was
that
the
assault
in
question
happened
under
color
of
law.
patrolman
allen
used
his
police
weapon.
he
used
his
police
identification
to
get
one
of
the
petitioners
out
of
the
car,
and
then
assaulted
one
petitioner
with
a
knife,
and
as
the
petitioners
fled
used
his
service
revolver
to
attempt
to
kill
them.
the
district
court,
as
i
also
noted,
found
a
number
of
specific
policies
which
had
been
engaged
in
by
the
police
department,
and
concluded,
i
think
correctly,
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that
is
a
possible
reading
of
it,
but
that,
i
think,
only
puts
an
additional
wrinkle
in
the
causation
claim.
that
is
to
say,
on
your
characterization,
the
judge
found
four
policies
which
caused
chapman
not
to
know
about
what
was
going
on,
and
chapman's
lack
of
knowledge
caused
the
assault.
so
whether
you
see
the
causation
as
a
two-step...
or
a
one-step--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--we
don't
read
the
district
court's
opinion
like
that.
all
of
the
findings
with
regard
to
these
practices
would
make
no
sense
if
the
district
judge
thought
that
the
mere
fact
that
chapman
was
the
supervisor
is
enough
to
impose
liability
on
him.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
let
me
answer
that
question
in...
with
before
and
after
the
point
which
i
broke
it
up
with
my
interruption.
certainly
the
judge
made
it
clear
he
understood
that
the
city
was
going
to
be
liable.
not
only
did
he
reiterate
on
three
occasions
that
chapman
was
liable
in
his
official
capacity,
but
in
his
opinion
he
quoted
that
portion
of
this
court's
decision
in
monell
which
said
a
finding
of
liability
against
an
official
in
his
official
capacity
runs
against
the
entity
rather
than
the
official
person.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--let
me
answer
those
questions
in
reverse
order.
i
think
your
description
of
the
policy
is
correct.
it
was
not
the
policy
of
the
city
to
encourage
assaults
on
teenagers
parked
in
shady
lanes
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
but
it
was
the
policy
of
the
department
to
take
no
action
and
indeed
to
make
no
effort
to
remove
from
the
force
officials
whom
were
well
known
to
be
dangerous
officers,
people
who
have
a
propensity
for
violence,
who
were
regarded
in
this
case
as
so
dangerous
by
their
colleagues
in
the
department
that
other
police
officers
would
not
ride
in
the
same
squad
car
with
the
patrolman
who
committed
this
offense.
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
was
virtually
a
complete
breakdown
in
control.
i
mean,
people
were
given
guns
and
badges
and
set
loose
on
the
citizenry.
there
was
simply
no
control
over
them.
if
they
turned
out
to
be
dangerous,
violent
human
beings
who
went
around
beating
people
up
or
shooting
at
them,
the
police
department
in
memphis
had
a
policy
of
doing
nothing
about
it.
and
we
think
that
such
a
policy
certainly
is
sufficient
under
monell.
monell
contemplates
that
liability
is
imposed
not
merely
for--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
think
there
are
interesting
questions
like
that
raised
by
this
case
but
not
at
this
time.
i
think
that
you
earlier
suggested,
and
i
think
correctly
so,
that
that
is
an
issue
which,
if
it
can
be
addressed
at
all,
ought
to
be
addressed
in
the
first
instance
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
is
a
situation
like
the
situation
discussed
in
footnote
3
of
peratt
against
taylor,
in
which
these...
that
is
to
say,
these
issues
were
never
raised
in
the
district
court,
the
questions
that
are
raised--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no,
it
did
not.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
that
your
characterization
of
it
is
a
very
strained
one.
reviewing
the
trial
transcript,
and
indeed
the
briefs
on
appeal,
looking
at
that
very
issue,
my
reading
of
what
happened
is
that
no
one
really
questioned
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
here.
you
had
two
individuals
accused
of
no
crime
whatsoever
who
were
assaulted
by
a
police
officer
acting
under
color
of
law.
there
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
a
point
in
the
litigation
where
the
defendants
denied,
and
i
think
no
defendant
reasonably
could,
that
that
violated
the
constitution
in
a
number
of
ways.
the
issue
as
all
parties
perceived
it
below
was
whether
or
not
liability
for
that
extended
beyond
the
particular
patrolman
who
wielded
the
knife
and
pulled
the
trigger.
and
again,
like
the
problem
about
monell,
that
is
an
issue
which
was
not
raised
in
the
district
court,
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
probably
can't
be
raised
at
this
late
date,
and
in
any
event
shouldn't
be
raised
in
the
first
instance
here
without
the
court
of
appeals
having
a
chance
to
look
at
it.
the
district
court
judgment,
as
i
indicated,
ran
against
the
director
in
his
official
capacity.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
that
judgment
in
fact
was
a
judgment
against
him
personally.
based
on
that
premise,
it
then
applied
the
good
faith
and
immunity
rule
of
scheuer
against
rhodes
and
procunier
against
navarette,
and
found
that
director
chapman
had
acted
in
good
faith.
at
the
point
of
the
district
court
opinion,
as
chance
would
have
it,
by
operation
of
rule
43(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
director
chapman
was
no
longer
a
party
to
the
litigation.
of
course,
he
had
left
office
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
nominal
defendant
at
that
point
was
police
director
holt.
in
any
event,
the
narrow
issue
which
we
think
is
before
this
court
is
not
an
issue
of
first
impression.
in
our
view,
it
is
an
issue
of
fourth
impression.
the
question
of
whether
a
judgment
against
an
official
in
his
official
capacity
runs
against
the
entity
or
against
the
individual
personally
has
been
resolved
three
times
before.
it
was
first
resolved
by
this
court
in
monell.
in
monell,
the
question
was
what
standard
would
apply
in
the
case
of
an
action
against
a
municipality,
and
the
court
noted
that
that
same
standard,
the
precise
scope
of
which
i
think
we
agree
is
not
entirely
clear
yet,
was
equally
applicable
to
a
suit
against
an
official
in
the
official's
official
capacity.
secondly,
in
the
same
month--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
may
be
circumstances,
none
of
which
come
to
mind
at
this
point,
where
there
might
be
some
difference.
the
specific
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
good
faith
immunity
rule
would
apply
in
such
a
case,
and
you
expressly
resolved
that
question
in
owen
against
city
of
independence.
mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
perhaps
understated
the
language
in
monell.
monell
says
that
a
claim
against
an
individual
in
his
official
capacity
is
generally
the
same
as
a
claim
against
the
entity
of
which
he
is
an
official.
now,
the
word
"generally"
i
take
it
was
sort
of
precautionary
language
the
court
customarily
and
wisely
uses,
you
know,
to
guard
against
the
possibility
that
some
situation
might
arise
where
such
a
claim
wasn't
to
be
treated
as
identical
to
a
claim
against
the
city.
but
rule
25
in
our
view
contemplates
that
they
are
to
be
treated
as
the
same
thing,
and
no
case
comes
to
mind
which
would
be
different.
it
is
one
of
the
annoying
things
about
the
law
that
cases
which
don't
come
to
mind
sometimes
do
come
to
pass,
and
i
don't
want
to...
as
the
president
is
prone
to
say,
presidents
never
say
never,
i
am
a
little
reluctant
to
say
never
myself.
but
certainly
no
case
that
i
can
imagine
exists
in
which
these...
in
which
a
judgment
against
an
official
in
his
official
capacity
would
be
any
different
than
a
judgment
against
the
entity
itself.
in
any
event,
the
specific
question
at
issue
here
is
whether
there
is
any
difference
between
a
judgment
against
an
official
in
his
official
capacity
and
a
judgment
against
the
entity
with
regard
to
the
good
faith
defense
recognized
by
percunier
and
scheuer
against
rhodes.
that
was
the
precise
issue
that
was
before
the
court
in
owen
against
city
of
independence,
in
which
the
officials...
the
defendant
was
not
just
in
that
case
the
city
of
independence,
but
a
number
of
officials
who
were
sued
in
their
official
capacity,
and
the
court
in
owen
noted
that
only
the
liability
of
the
municipality
was
at
issue
in
owen,
not
any
liability
of
the
individuals.
a
similar
reading
of
what
it
means
to
have
a
judgment
against
an
official
in
his
official
capacity
was
made
by
the
court
in
huddo
against
finney
with
regard
to
liability
issues
and
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
think
that
all
of
these
decisions
are
clearly
correctly
decided,
and
one
need
look
no
further
than
the
actual
language
of
rule
25(d),
which
provides
that
upon
the
removal
from
office
of
any
official
in
an
official
capacity
action,
his
or
her
successor
is
to
be
substituted.
that
rule
would
make
absolutely
no
sense
if
an
official
capacity
judgment
imposed
personal
liability.
that
would
mean
that
if
we
had
a
judgment
against
mr.
chapman
in
his
official
capacity
for
$1
million,
he
resigned
and
was
replaced
by
director
holt,
that
we
could
then
garnish
director
holt's
salary
and
seize
director
holt's
house.
it
is
simply
inconceivable
that
the
framers
of
rule
25
contemplated
that
an
official
capacity
action
could
produce
personal
liability
of
that
sort.
on
the
contrary,
the
committee
note
makes
it
quite
clear
that
official
capacity
actions
are
actions
which,
although
brought
in
form
against
a
named
officer,
are
intrinsically
against
the
government.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
am
not
sure
about
that,
but
i
would
say
that
certainly
must
have
been
its
intent,
because
the
problems
which
arose
that
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
in
1951
about
official
capacity
lawsuits
were
mostly
lawsuits
against
government
officials
for
money.
snyder
against
buck
and
the
like
were
actually
damage
actions,
and
it
had
long
been
assumed
in
those
cases,
in
suits
against
a
postmaster
or
whatever,
that
the
government
was
going
to
actually
have
to
pay
the
bill.
the
problem
in
those
cases
was
one
postmaster
would
leave
office,
another
postmaster
would
come
in,
and
there
would
be
procedural
chaos.
but
i
expect
if
we
took
another
look
at
the
committee
notes,
there
would
be
reference
to
a
number
of
these
cases,
most
of
which,
as
i
say,
were
damage
actions,
not
injunctive
actions.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
personally?
mr.
eric
schnapper
no.
mr.
eric
schnapper
a
couple
of
quick
things.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
earlier
asked
whether
under
monell
one
had
to
have
a
policy.
at
436
us
at
690,
the
list
of
things
that
are
sufficient
under
monell
includes
a
decision,
so
a
discrete
act
or,
i
would
think,
failure
to
act
as
well
as
an
ongoing
failure
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
klein
suggested,
though
i
may
have
misheard
him,
that
there
was
no
discussion
at
the
trial
court
level
of
the
monell
standards.
at
page
21
of
our
brief,
we
refer
to
a
discussion
of
just
those
standards,
and
the
need
to
prove
policy
under
monell.
however,
we
think
that
much
of
the
discussion
that
we
have
presented
runs
a
bit
far
afield
of
what
the
court
should
appropriately
decide
at
this
juncture.
there
are
two,
perhaps
two
questions
that
we
have
been
considering.
first,
did
the
district
judge
properly
find
chapman
liable
in
his
official
capacity,
and
second,
is
such
a
judgment
against
an
official
in
his
official
capacity
a
judgment
which
runs
against
the
city
rather
than
against
chapman
personally.
it
is
only
the
second
question
that
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
indeed,
it
was
only
the
second
question
that
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
at
three
points
in
the
joint
appendix,
pages
30,
39,
and
46,
characterizes
this
as
a
suit
against
director
chapman
in
his
official
capacity,
and
at
page
46
squarely
holds
that
a
judgment
against
an
official
in
his
official
capacity
runs
only
against
him
personally.
now,
at
this
juncture,
that
finding,
i
think,
stands
almost
undefended.
i
think
mr.
klein
came
close
to
conceding
that
it
was
wrong.
certainly
he
has
not
gone
to
the
point
of
arguing
that
it
is
right.
but
in
any
event,
that
is
the
only
decision
that
was
actually
resolved
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
think
that
is
all
that
need
appropriately
be
considered
here.
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court
should
have
imposed
liability
on
chapman
in
his
official
capacity
is
a
much
more
far-reaching,
far-ranging
kind
of
bundle
of
problems,
none
of
which
were
addressed
below.
in
discussing
them,
we
have
conducted
something
of
a
grand
tour
of
civil
procedure
jurisprudence,
the
problems
of
monell,
of
percunier.
mr.
justice
stephens
raised
some
issues
about
the
swind
against
pullman
standard.
we've
got
problems
under
rules
8
and
9
and
12
and
a
bunch
of
other
rules.
none
of
these
questions
were
raised
below.
none
of
these
questions
were
decided
below.
and
none
of
these
questions
in
our
view
need
be
decided
here.
