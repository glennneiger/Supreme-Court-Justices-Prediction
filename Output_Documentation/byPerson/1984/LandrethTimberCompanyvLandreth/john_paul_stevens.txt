justice
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
question?
i
suppose
the
other
side
of
the
argument
is
that
congress
might
not
really
have
been
thinking
about
the
scope
that
your
rule
will
carry
federal
jurisdiction.
i
guess
you
would
find
a
violation
of
10(b)(4)
every
time
there's
an
allegation
of
breach
of
warranty
or
any
misrepresentation
of
any
kind
in
any
private
sale
of
stock.
justice
stevens
and
in
every
case
in
which
any
warranty
in
a
contract
with
respect
to
the
financial
condition
of
the
company
is
alleged
to
have
been
misleading
or
breached
in
some
respect.
justice
stevens
would
it
be
co-extensive
with
common
law
fraud
actions
and
breach
of
contract,
or
a
little
broader,
i
suppose?
justice
stevens
but
you
still
have
your
state
common
law
action
which
you--
justice
stevens
--do
you
think
there's
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
congress
thought
it
was
giving
federal
jurisdiction
for
a
suit
like
this?
justice
stevens
you
rely
on
the
interstate
advertising
and
all
that.
but
i
suppose
your
case
would
be
the
same
if
they
just
called
him
up
on
the
phone
and
said
i've
got
a
good
deal
for
you,
and
they
didn't
have
any
public
advertising
or
anything
like
that.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
to
be
sure
i
follow
it
as
you
go
through,
does
that
mean
that
you
would
agree
there
was
a
security
if
they
had
sold
40
percent
of
the
company
to
these
people.
justice
stevens
does
it
further
mean
you
would
agree
there
was
a
security
in
that
event?
justice
stevens
i
said
40
percent.
he
did
not
acquire
control.
he
said
40
percent
of
the
company
to
the
purchaser
instead
of
100
percent.
justice
stevens
would
that
be
a
covered
transaction,
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
you're
saying
he
didn't.
the
seller
retained
60
percent.
justice
stevens
you
would
say
it
was
not
a
covered
transaction.
justice
stevens
but
if
he
sold
60
percent,
it
would
have
been
a
covered
transaction.
justice
stevens
i
thought
you
did,
too.
justice
stevens
no.
my
first
question
is
the
purchaser
buys
40
percent
of
this
company.
justice
stevens
and
the
seller
retains
the
remaining
60
percent.
justice
stevens
is
the
transaction
covered
or
not?
justice
stevens
it
is?
justice
stevens
but
it's
not
covered
if
he
gets
51
percent.
justice
stevens
but
if
it
was
a
40
percent
price,
we
are
clear
that
would
be
a
security
and
all
the
economic
realities
would
satisfy
your
standard.
justice
stevens
no
gimmicks.
justice
stevens
no.
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure.
justice
stevens
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
just
thinking
of
a
little
different
kind
of
case?
suppose
you
had
a
listed
stock,
something
you
traded
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
and
there
was
a
control
block.
to
make
my
hypothetical
easy,
assume
it's
52
percent
of
the
stock,
a
negotiated
transaction,
and
the
purchaser
gets
resignations
of
directors
and
clearly
gets
the
right
to
appoint
the
new
management,
and
there's
complete,
you
know,
arm's
length
negotiation
between
two
bargaining
equals.
would
that
be
covered
or
not
under
your
view?
justice
stevens
so
your
argument
really
doesn't
apply
to
publicly
traded
securities
at
all.
justice
stevens
i
see.
