mr.
quarles,
i
suppose
the
form
the
transaction
took
was
largely
guided
by
tax
reasons,
wasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
rather
than
the
assets--
justice
blackmun
--had
it
been
of
the
assets,
i
suppose
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
justice
blackmun
somewhere
in
your
argument
you
will
discuss
the
effect
of
your
position
on
the
williams
act,
i
take
it?
justice
blackmun
or
100
percent.
justice
blackmun
why
didn't
you
insist
on
an
assets
transaction...
tax
purposes?
justice
blackmun
usually
the
seller
does,
and
the
buyer
wants
the
assets.
