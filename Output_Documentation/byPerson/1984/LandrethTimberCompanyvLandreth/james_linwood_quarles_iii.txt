mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
the
court's
permission
i'd
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
of
my
allotted
time
for
rebuttal.
in
november
1977,
seven
and
one-half
years
ago,
the
common
stock
of
landreth
timber
company,
located
in
tonasket,
washington
was
sold
pursuant
to
a
stock
purchase
agreement.
more
than
six
years
have
now
been
devoted
to
litigating
the
question
of
whether
those
shares
bearing
all
the
common,
ordinary,
traditional
attributes
of
common
stock
are
securities.
if
the
parties'
reasonable
expectations
in
1977
are
relevant...
and
this
court
has
declared
that
they
are
in
the
forman
decision...
then
it
is
appropriate
to
examine
what
the
state
of
the
law
was
in
1977
when
the
parties
structured
their
transaction
and
what
has
happened
to
the
law
since
then.
in
1977
the
federal
securities
laws
had
been
in
place
for
more
than
40
years,
and
this
court
had
applied
them
to
a
broad
variety
of
transactions,
including
private
transactions
in
cases
such
as
bankers
life
and
to
transactions
involving
the
transfer
of
control
in
tsc
industries
v.
northway.
in
1977
when
the
parties
structured
this
transaction,
no
court
of
appeals
had
published
an
opinion
holding
that
common
stock
would
lose
its
status
as
a
security
if
sufficient
numbers
of
those
shares
were
exchanged
to
transfer
control.
indeed,
in
the
relevant
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
had
twice
applied
the
federal
securities
laws
to
the
ultimate
purchase
of
one
hundred
percent
of
the
stock
of
a
business
in
pratt
v.
robinson
in
1950
and
in
mathison
v.
armbrust
in
1960.
in
1981
the
certainty
which
had
existed
for
almost
50
years
was
replaced
by
substantial
uncertainty.
the
seventh
circuit
held
in
1981
that
stock
might
not
be
a
security
if
it
was
exchanged
in
a
transaction
which
wasn't
also
an
investment
contract.
the
circuits
began
to
do
battle.
the
tenth
and
eleventh
circuits
joined
the
seventh
circuit.
in
1984
in
the
present
case
the
ninth
circuit
joined
those
circuits...
the
seventh,
tenth
and
eleventh...
and
told
the
petitioner
that
the
stock
which
had
been
purchased
seven
years
earlier
was
not
a
security
and
that
the
petitioner
was
remitted
to
the
state
law
remedies
of
contract
and
fraud,
precisely
the
remedies
congress
had
determined
were
inappropriate
when
it
enacted
the
1933
and
1934
acts.
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
there
was
no...
as
to
my
clients
there
was
no
choice
involved.
the
seller
in
this
case,
mr.
landreth,
insisted
from
the
outset
that
the
transaction
be
structured
as
a
sale
of
securities.
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
i'm
not
certain
that
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
situation
which
is
involved
here,
involving
the
sale
of
assets,
also
involved
services
which
were
to
have
been
provided
by
the...
by
mr.
landreth,
the
seller.
we
certainly
wouldn't
be
here
arguing
about
the
question
of
stock,
but
we
might
be
here
trying
to
determine
whether
this
was
an
investment
contract.
in
contrast
to
the
decisions
of
the
seventh
and
ninth
circuits,
five
other
circuits
have
declared
that
common
stock
is
always
common
stock.
the
fourth
circuit
has
adhered
to
its
decision
in
occidental,
the
first
decision
in
1974.
the
fifth
circuit
has
emphatically
rejected
the
doctrine
in
its
daily
v.
morgan
decision.
the
second
circuit
has
done
so
twice
in
seagrave
and
then
in
golden
v.
garafalo.
and
finally,
in
what
i
submit
is
a
very
scholarly
and
persuasive
opinion,
judge
gibbons
of
the
third
circuit
has
exhaustively
considered
the
arguments
for
writing
some
stock
transactions
out
of
the
definitional
sections
of
the
act,
and
emphatically
has
rejected
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
sale
of
business
doctrine
in
a
case
which
will
be
argued
this
afternoon,
ruefenacht.
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
uncertainty
in
the
application
of
the
securities
laws
arose
in
1981
because
the
seventh
and
ultimately
the
ninth
circuit
shifted
their
focus
from
the
instrument
being
sold
to
the
transaction
in
which
it
was
sold;
and
they
then
required
that
the
transaction,
not
the
instrument,
meet
the
definition
of
an
investment
contract,
or
in
the
ninth
circuit's
variation
of
that,
risk
capital
test.
it
bears
repeating,
i
think,
what
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
does.
this
court
has
always
focused
upon
what
the
character
of
the
instrument
was
when
it
was
created,
not
the
method
by
which
it
was
exchanged.
the
ninth
circuit
reverses
that
focus
and
focuses
completely
on
the
transaction
in
which
it
is
exchanged
and
ignores
the
instrument
being
exchanged.
to
hold
landreth
timber's...
that
landreth
timber's
conventional
stock
was
not
a
security
is
surely
a
strange
use
of
the
language,
and
i
submit
a
misuse
of
the
statutory
language.
the
instrument
which
we
are
talking
about
today
and
which
was
purchased
seven
years
ago
was
held
by
both
the
district
court
and
recognized
by
the
ninth
circuit
to
possess,
and
i
quote,
"the
ordinary
characteristics
of
stock".
it
bore
all
of
the
characteristics
of
stock
which
have
been
identified
by
this
court:
the
right
to
dividends,
negotiability,
voting
rights
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
shares
owned,
and
the
prospect
of
appreciation.
i
submit
that
any
reasonable
person
in
1977
would
have
understood
themselves
to
be
engaged
in
the
purchase
of
a
security.
the
principals
of
the
purchasing
group,
for
example,
were
a
mr.
samuel
dennis
and
a
mr.
john
bolten.
mr.
dennis
was
at
the
time
he
received
a
solicitation
which
touted
the
prospects
of
an
attractive
return
upon
the
capital
to
be
invested,
not
an
opportunity
to
earn
a
living
in
the
lumber
business.
mr.
dennis
was
then
a
67-year
old
lawyer
residing
in
boston,
massachusetts,
completely
across
the
continent
from
washington
state.
the
other
principal
investor,
the
late
mr.
bolten,
was
then
84
years
old
and
living
in
florida.
neither
of
them
were
interested
in
moving
to
washington
state
to
undertake
new
careers
as
lumbermen.
the
representations,
and
we
submit
the
misrepresentations,
that
were
made
to
induce
these
gentlemen
to
purchase
this
stock
were
typical
of
the
representations
that
were
made
to
induce
the
purchase
of
stock.
in
addition
to
representations
concerning
the
existing
contracts
which
the
company
had,
the
liabilities
which
were
to
be
assumed,
representations
were
made
that
the
company's
mill,
which
had
earlier
been
destroyed
by
fire,
was
being
reconstructed
on
schedule,
was
being
reconstructed
out
of
the
insurance
proceeds
that
the
additional
construction
costs
to
the
purchasers
would
be
minimal,
that
it
could
operate
after
reconstruction
on
a
two-shift
basis,
that
it
would
produce
as
much
as
twice
the
industry
standard
of
lumber
per
log,
that
it
would
produce
profitable,
high
grade
timber,
and
that
it
would
produce
an
acceptable
return
on
the
investment,
on
the
capital
that
was
to
be
invested.
the
falsity
of
those
representations
resulted
in
the
expenditure
of
more
than
$500,000
additional
to
the
amount
that
was
represented
as
the
cost
of
reconstructing
the
mill.
undisclosed
liabilities
surfaced.
even
after
the
mill
was
reconstructed
at
substantial
additional
expense,
it
never
performed
as
represented
and
was
ultimately
sold
at
a
foreclosure
sale.
and
further,
as
i
mentioned
with
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
transaction
was
structured
as
a
sale
of
stock.
it
was
done
so
at
mr.
landreth's
insistence.
pursuant
to
the
stock
purchase
agreement
that
is
involved
here
two
things
changed
hands
on
november
17,
1977:
500
shares
of
landreth
timber
company's
conventional
stock,
and
$3,400,000.
indeed,
the
parties'
expectations
is
perhaps
best
illustrated
when
mr.
landreth
was
confronted
with
the
overrun
and
challenged
as
to
the
representations
which
were
made.
he
responded,
"i
sold
stock.
"
"i
didn't
sell
anything
else.
"
the
petitioner
sued
in
this
case
in
november
of
1978.
extensive
discovery
was
conducted
for
more
than
three
years
on
petitioner's
claims
that
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
1933
and
1934
acts
had
been
violated
and
dependent
state
law
claims.
however,
when
the
seventh
circuit
issued
its
first
sale
of
business
doctrine
decision,
the
defendants
moved
for
summary
judgment,
asserting
that
the
shares
they
had
sold
were
not
securities.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment,
holding
that
every
security,
whatever
the
instrument
may
be,
must
meet
the
definition
of
an
investment
contract;
and
that
this
transaction,
even
though
it
involved
stock
with
all
of
the
ordinary
characteristics
of
stock,
could
not
do
so.
and
why
couldn't
it
do
so?
according
to
the
district
court,
the
third
requirement
of
the
howey
test,
a
reasonable
expectation
of
profits
from
the
efforts
of
others,
could
not
be
met,
the
court
held,
because
mr.
landreth
was
merely
a
consultant.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed,
holding
that
the
howey
investment
contract
test
must
be
applied,
and
that
the
requirement
of
an
expectation
of
profits
from
the
efforts
of
others
could
not
be
met.
i
submit
that
the
analysis
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
at
every
turn.
it
ignored
the
language
of
the
acts,
their
structure
and
purpose,
and
it
cannot
be
applied,
i
submit,
without
producing
arbitrary,
logical
and
unworkable
results
which
will
burden
district
courts
in
cases
such
as
this
for
years
to
come.
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
on
the
facts
of
that
case
i
do
not.
there,
of
course,
the
stock
which
was
involved
this
court
analyzed
very
thoroughly
before
it
proceeded
to
the
investment
contract
test.
this
court
looked
at
all
of
the
attributes
of
common
stock
and
found
that
the
stock
informant
had
none
of
them.
the
court
said
if
you
look
at
this
instrument,
this
instrument
does
not
have
the
ordinary
characteristics
of
common
stock,
and
then
proceeded
to
the
investment
contract
test.
what
the
ninth
circuit
proposes
and
the
other
circuits
who
have
adopted
this
doctrine
propose
is
to
eliminate
the
first
part
of
this
court's
opinion
in
forman,
and
in
every
case
to
turn
to
the
question
can
this
meet
the
test
of
an
investment
contract.
i
begin
with
what
i
believe
to
be
the
appropriate
starting
point
for
any
statutory
construction:
the
language
of
the
statute.
both
the
1933
and
the
1934
acts
define
security
to
include
the
term
1933
when
congress
acted.
landreth
timber
company's
stock
is
conceded
to
have
all
of
the
ordinary
characteristics
of
that
stock,
all
of
the
characteristics
identified
by
this
court
in
tcherepnin
and
again
in
forman.
but
the
ninth
circuit
said
no,
we're
not
going
to
look
at
that.
we're
not
going
to
look
at
the
definition
of
stock.
the
appropriate
definition
for
us
to
look
at
is
the
investment
contract
test.
i
respectfully
submit
that
such
a
construction
of
the
statute
turns
the
statute
and
its
words
on
its
head.
the
separately
listed
instruments
which
precede
investment
contract
are
meaningless
unless
they
have
some
meaning
different
from
investment
contract.
and
this
court
held
in
joiner
that
the
more
general
terms
in
the
statute
were
meant
to
expand,
not
to
limit
the
more
specific
terms
which
they
followed.
furthermore,
this
court
declared
only
two
years
ago
in
marine
bank
that
the
statutory
definition
"includes
ordinary
stocks
and
bonds".
this
court
has
applied
the
investment
contract
test
only
to
atypical
instruments
which
could
only
be
securities
if
they
met
the
investment
contract
test.
first,
the
orange
groves
in
howey;
next,
the
leases
of
land
next
to
oil
wells
in
joiner;
the
withdrawable
shares
in
tcherepnin;
the
lease
deposits
in
forman;
the
pension
fund
in
daniels;
the
profit-sharing
arrangement
in
marine
bank.
that
this
court
applied
the
investment
contract
test
in
those
cases
is
scarcely
remarkable.
that
is
what
the
parties
claimed
the
contract
was,
an
investment
contract.
accordingly,
i
submit
there
is
no
warrant
in
the
statute
for
holding
that
only
an
investment
contract
is
a
security.
turn
next,
if
you
will,
to
the
violence
which
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
does
to
the
structure
of
the
1933
and
the
1934
acts.
application
of
those
acts,
an
important
consideration
for
parties
as
they
structure
transactions,
and
for
their
counsel
who
advise
them
as
they
structure
those
transactions,
turns
on
whether
an
instrument
is
a
security,
so
that
it
is
critical
to
know
either
that
a
security
always
is
or
never
is
a
security.
that
is
the
fundamental
purpose
of
having
the
definitional
section
determine
whether
an
instrument
always
is
or
never
can
become
a
security.
when
congress
wanted
to
exempt
a
specific
transaction,
it
had
no
difficulty
whatsoever
in
doing
so.
but
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
results
in
the
following
anomalous
situation:
the
same
instrument
can
be
a
security
at
some
time
and
in
some
people's
hands
but
not
at
other
times
and
not
in
other
people's
hands.
this
case
presents
a
graphic
example
of
that.
mr.
landreth's
two
sons
each
owned
60
of
the
500
shares
of
landreth
timber
company
stock...
not
enough
to
constitute
control
under
any
test.
under
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning,
they
presumably
sold
securities
because
they
weren't
selling
anything
that
looked
like
controls,
although
on
the
other
hand,
the
purchasers
who
acquired
those
securities
did
not
buy
securities
because,
according
to
the
ninth
circuit,
somehow
control
was
involved.
but
if
we
move
to
the
next
day
and
the
purchaser
sold
those
precise
same
60
shares
in
a
public
offering,
apparently
under
the
ninth
circuit
reasoning
those
same
instruments
would
have
become
securities
again.
that
result
is
not
only
anomalous
but
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
carefully
constructed
pattern
of
the
1933
and
1934
acts.
in
those
acts
congress
exempted
some
transactions
or
some
securities
from
some
but
not
all
of
the
provisions
of
those
acts.
but
there's
more
than
just
an
offense
to
the
statutory
pattern
if
you
try
to
graft
this
doctrine
onto
a
securities
law
to
which
it
was
a
stranger
for
more
than
50
years.
examine
for
just
a
moment
the
difficulty
which
a
district
court
will
be
required
to
grapple
with
every
time
someone
says
i
didn't
sell
a
security;
my
transaction
wasn't
an
investment
contract.
both
the
seventh
and
the
ninth
circuits
apparently
make
the
presence
of
control
the
determinant.
the
seventh
circuits
adds
new
gloss
to
it.
they
say
that
perhaps
it
will
be
helpful
for
a
district
court
to
grapple
with
the
question
of
whether
someone
was
an
investor
or
an
entrepreneur.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
ignored
these
issues
in
the
case
that
was
before
it,
because
they
focused
upon
the
presence
of
a
shell
corporation
which
was
formed
to
acquire
this
stock.
let's
look,
however,
for
just
a
moment
at
the
economic
realities
which
underlie
this
transaction.
there's
no
dispute
that
they
are
as
follows.
the
petitioner
here
was
a
shell
corporation
formed
for
the
sole
purpose
of
acquiring
landreth's
shares
and
then
merging
with
landreth
timber.
mr.
dennis,
the
gentleman
who,
lived
in
boston
and
was
a
lawyer,
owned
50
percent
of
the
voting
shares
of
the
resulting
corporation.
mr.
bolten,
the
gentleman
who
resided
in
florida
and
was
retired,
owned
the
other
50
percent
of
the
shares.
six
other
people,
two
located
in
massachusetts
and
four
in
washington
state,
owned
the
remaining
15
percent
of
the
equity
but
had
no
vote.
neither
mr.
dennis
nor
mr.
bolten
was
able
to,
as
a
result
of
ability
or
geographical
proximity,
to
run
landreth
timber
company,
so
they
made
mr.
landreth's
services
for
a
year
a
condition
of
sale,
explicitly
stated
that
if
you
won't
stay
as
a
consultant
and
help
reconstruct
this
mill,
and
you
won't
help
us
for
six
months
thereafter
smoothing
the
transition,
this
deal
won't
happen.
now,
if
the
district
court
is
required
to
determine
who
had
control
in
this
situation,
how
does
it
determine
between
mr.
dennis
and
mr.
bolten?
neither
could
outvote
the
other.
how
is
the
district
court
to
determine?
what
is
the
test
that
it
should
use?
the
case
this
afternoon
graphically
demonstrates
the
variety
of
situations
in
which
this
question
of
control
will
be
presented
in
the
future.
will,
for
example,
the
purchase
of
an
initial
block
of
49
shares,
49
percent
of
the
stock
be
a
security,
but
the
purchase
of
the
next
2
percent
not
be
a
security,
or
does
the
purchase
of
the
second
2
percent
require
that
the
first
49
were
not
a
security?
those
types
of
questions
will
burden
district
courts
endlessly.
furthermore,
if
someone
is
to
attempt
to
make
a
distinction
between
investors
and
entrepreneurs,
a
distinction
which
even
the
seventh
circuit
who
adopted
the
distinction
recognized
to
be
fuzzy,
i
submit
that
it
ignores
economic
realities
to
hold
that
acquiring
mr.
landreth's
services
by
a
consulting
contract
instead
of
by
an
employment
agreement
or
some
other
form
transforms
mr.
dennis
and
mr.
bolten
from
the
category
of
investors
to
entrepreneurs.
surely
the
result
would
not
have
been
different
in
howey
if
the
citrus
grove
promoters
had
been
smart
enough
to
structure
their
transaction
to
make
themselves
citrus
consultants.
this
uncertainty
of
application
of
the
securities
laws
and
the
illogical
results
that
it
produces
will
burden
lawyers
and
parties
they
advise
as
they
structure
transactions,
and
it
will
force
district
courts
to
struggle
to
determine
whether
they
have
jurisdiction
and
produce
the
potentially
wasteful
result
which
happened
here
three
years
into
litigation,
a
determination
that
jurisdiction
does
not
exist.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
addressed
in
its
amicus
brief
some
of
the
problems
which
this
changeable
notion
of
now
it's
a
security,
now
it's
not,
now
it
is
again
injects
into
their
enforcement
burdens,
and
presumably
they
will
discuss
that
further
this
afternoon.
but
i
submit
that
the
difficulty
of
applying
the
test
which
was
proposed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
illogical
results
it
produces,
and
the
inability
to
reconcile
the
test
which
is
proposed
with
the
language
of
the
acts,
and
the
structure
which
congress
employed
when
it
adopted
those
acts
shows
how
far
adrift
this
approach
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
from
the
statute
and
from
the
purposes
behind
it.
the
federal
securities
laws
are
broad.
they
are
broad
because
congress
was
legislating
broadly
and
reacting
to
a
broad
lack
of
confidence
which
had
been
caused
by
the
great
crash
and
the
ensuing
depression.
congress
was
not
dispensing
its
protection
stingily
attempting
to
determine
whether
this
person
should
be
denied
coverage
because
of
some
transactionally
based
exemption.
congress
was
legislating
broadly
in
an
attempt
to
restore
investor
confidence
and
to
lure
capital
which
congress
had
found
to
become
timid
to
the
point
of
hoarding
back
into
the
capital
markets.
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
i
would
say
that
10(b)(5)
and
its
requirements
would
apply,
as
this
court
has
held,
in
private,
face-to-face
negotiations
as
well
as
in
negotiations
which
occur
over
the
national--
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
--upon
a
demonstration
of
the
proof
of
the
requisite
scienter
and
the
other
requirements
of
10(b)(5),
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
it
is
substantially
different,
your
honor.
one
of
the
questions
that
is
presented
by
this
case
is
what
happens
if
you
say
this
instrument
is
not
a
security.
many
state
law
security
statutes
employ
exactly
the
same
definition
as
the
federal
laws
do.
that's
essentially
the
case
in
washington
state.
washington
state
also
says
that
its
statute
is
to
be
construed
conformably
to
the
federal
statute.
so
as
a
result
of
holding
that
this
is
not
a
security
for
federal
purposes,
you
may
well
have,
as
my
brother
has
indicated
he
will
argue
in
the
state
court
if
that's
where
we're
remitted,
you
may
have
decided
that
there
was
not
a
state
security
sold.
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
washington...
this
court
said
just
two
terms
ago
in
huddleston
and
mclean
that
the
burden
of
proof
upon
a
defrauded
purchaser
is
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
my
brother
will
argue,
if
we're
ever
forced
to
return
to
the
state
courts,
that
washington's
standard
ought
to
apply,
which
is
clear,
cogent
and
convincing
evidence
a
standard
which
congress
presumably
knew
about
when
it
decided
that
securities
instruments
ought
not
to
be
subjected
to
state
law
remedies.
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
yes.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
the
one
point
in
the
legislative
history
in
which
congress
turned
to
the
question
of
what
about
someone
who
puts
together
a
corporation,
runs
it
for
a
while,
and
then
turns
it...
makes
it
available
to
the
public.
what
happened
in
this
situation
if
you
look
at
the
economic
realities
is
a
corporation
run
in
washington
state
was
made
available
to
a
mr.
dennis,
who
lived
in
boston.
certainly
interstate
commerce
was
required.
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
my
case
would
be
the
same
since
they
would
have
used
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce.
but
they
also
would
have
had
to
speak
to
mr.
bolten,
who
resided
in
florida.
surely
had
congress
been
asked
are
we
to
be
thought
to
legislate
stingily
and
to
be
hoarding
the
protection
we're
giving,
or
are
we
intending
to
grant
broad
protection,
congress
would
have
said
we
mean
broad
protection.
indeed,
that
is
why
i
suggest
congress
afforded
new
remedies
and
required
full
disclosure
to
persons
who
dealt
with
certain
favored
instruments,
whether
they
dealt
with
them
face
to
face,
privately
negotiated,
or
on
the
exchanges.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
the
breadth
of
congress'
intent.
in
one
of
this
court's
earliest
decisions
under
the
securities
laws,
and
ironically
one
on
which
the
respondents
rely
heavily,
howey,
this
court
concluded
its
opinion
by
saying
the
statutory
policy
of
affording
broad
protection
to
investors
is
not
to
be
thwarted
by
unrealistic
and
irrelevant
formulae.
the
sale
of
business
approach
which
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
is,
i
submit,
just
such
an
unrealistic
and
irrelevant
formula.
it
should
be
rejected
and
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
reversed.
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
linwood
quarles,
iii
thank
you,
your
honor.
my
brother
commenced
part
of
his
argument
by
asking
me
if
perhaps
i
could
enlighten
you
as
to
what
i
thought
the
difference
was
between
a
typical
instrument
and
an
atypical
instrument.
a
typical
instrument
is
precisely
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
this
stock
to
be.
it's
an
instrument
that
answers
to
its
name
when
it's
called;
it
has
all
of
the
common
attributes
of
the
instrument
as
it's
understood
by
all
parties.
and
an
atypical
instrument
is
when
you
attempt
to
make
an
instrument
bear
a
burden
that
it
can't
bear.
you
try
to
call
stock,
in
forman
stock
instead
of
a
deposit
upon
a
lease.
my
brother
spent
a
substantial
portion
of
his
time
talking
about
the
common
enterprise
and
the
requirement
of
a
common
enterprise.
i
suggest
that
there
are
two
things
that
need
to
be
considered.
in
this
case
summary
judgment
was
granted,
but
the
plaintiff,
my
client,
argued
below...
and
there's
really
no
dispute
to
his
affidavit...
he
would
not
nave
gone
into
this
transaction
located
a
continent
away
from
him
if
he
did
not
have
the
consulting
services
of
mr.
landreth
who
had
run
this
enterprise
for
more
than
30
years.
so
that
the
common
enterprise
that
my
brother
looks
for
is
surely
there.
but
if
you're
going
to
impose
a
common
enterprise
test,
what
do
you
do
then
about
a
promoter
who
takes
a
bundle
of
rights,
bundles
them
up
and
sells
100
percent
of
them?
does
he
then
say
don't
look
at
me;
i
didn't
sell
a
security;
we
don't
have
a
common
enterprise.
furthermore,
the
other
point
that
i
wished
to
speak
to
briefly
was
the
suggestion
that
the
limited
purpose
of
this
act
suggests
that
this
court
should
somehow
draw
lines
now,
congress
having
acted
more
than
50
years
ago,
and
set
up
a
series
of
tests
that
would
help
justice
stevens
resolve
these
cases
in
the
future,
and
now
draw
a
line.
when
congress
drew
one
a
long
time
ago,
congress
said
those
instruments
are
stock.
