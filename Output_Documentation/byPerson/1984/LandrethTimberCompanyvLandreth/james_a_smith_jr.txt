mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
may
be
expected,
respondents
and
petitioner
agree
on
very
little,
including
the
definition
of
the
parties
in
this
case.
my
clients
are
ivan
landreth
and
his
family,
who
were
sellers
in
november
of
1977
of
a
sawmill
which
was
incomplete,
under
reconstruction,
wasn't
operating,
was
not
an
ongoing
business.
it
was
a
closely
held
family
corporation.
and
the
adverse
party
in
this
case,
who
mr.
quarles
represents,
although
he
makes
extensive
efforts
to
describe
it
as
an
individually
owned
entity,
is
in
fact
a
corporation
named
landreth
timber
company.
landreth
timber
company
is
the
successor
in
interest
to
b&d
company,
which
mr.
quarles'
clients
formed
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
100
percent
of
the
stock
of
landreth
timber.
the
petitioner
is
and
always
has
been
a
single
corporate
entity,
and
i
submit
that's
important.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
privately
negotiated
sale
of
a
closely
held
business,
accomplished
through
the
transfer
of
a
hundred
percent
of
its
stock
to
a
single
corporate
purchaser,
is
a
security
under
the
1933
and
the
1934
acts.
and
that
has
to
be
evaluated
in
light
of
two
major
principles
that
run
through
40
years
of
this
court's
decisions.
number
one,
after
this
sale
there
was
no
common
enterprise
of
any
kind
between
mr.
quarles'
clients
and
my
client,
the
seller,
or
for
that
matter
any
other
party.
there
was
no
intertwining
of
investor
fortunes
after
this
sale.
that's
essential
to
this
court's
definition
of
a
security.
and
second,
the
record
below
unequivocally
shows
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
assumed
complete,
one
hundred
percent
control
of
the
business,
and
from
the
day
the
sale
closed
proceeded
to
operate
it
as
its
own
business.
and
that
does
not
satisfy
this
court's
test
of
whether
there
has
been
an
investment
in
a
common
enterprise
premised
upon
a
reasonable
expectation
of
profits
to
come
from
the
entrepreneurial
or
managerial
efforts
of
others.
the
district
court
so
found,
and
so
did
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
mr.
quarles
says
the
law
underwent
a
massive
shift
in
1981,
that
this
new
sale
of
business
doctrine
was
injected
into
the
law
regarding
securities.
i
submit
that
that's
incorrect.
this
court
since
1943
in
the
joiner
decision
and
then
in
1946
in
the
howey
decision
in
each
and
every
of
six
decisions
has
looked
at
the
economic
realities
underlying
the
transaction.
and
the
test,
the
test
which
we
say
should
be
overlaid
on
this
private
transaction,
is
the
same
test
which
the
court
announced
in
sec
v.
howey
in
1946.
there's
nothing
new
about
this
test,
and
we
submit
that
the
question
before
the
court
is
not
whether
a
new
sale
of
business
doctrine
test
should
be
adopted,
but
whether
the
court
should
continue
to
apply
the
economic
realities
test,
which
it
enunciated
in
howey,
which
forman
said
is
the
touchstone
that
underlies
all
of
the
court's
decisions
regarding
a
security,
which
forman
said
for
our
purposes
is
no
different
than
the
definition
of
a
security
which
has
been
consistently
applied
by
this
court.
now,
i'd
like
to
summarize
what
respondents'
position
is
in
this
case.
we
start
with
the
structure
of
the
acts,
and
i
invite
the
court
in
response
to
petitioner's
point
to
consider
the
structure
of
the
acts.
the
1933
and
'34
acts
say
unless
the
context
otherwise
requires,
and
then
proceed
to
identify
approximately
17
different
instruments.
stock,
which
i
notice
mr.
quarles
referred
to
as
a
specialized
instrument,
an
instrument
that
deserves
special
protection,
is
not
even
the
first
instrument
listed.
the
first
instrument
listed
is
notes,
notes...
notes,
something
that
we
have,
all
have
common
understanding
of
what
constitutes
a
note.
but
can
you
decide
whether
a
note
by
itself
is
a
security
under
the
1933
act
without
the
application
of
additional
economic
criteria?
there's
nothing
in
the
structure
of
the
acts
which
gives
stock
any
more
dignity
than
any
other
term
under
the
act,
than
the
term
investment
contract,
then
the
term
notes,
than
the
term
debenture,
the
term
bonds.
that's
the
structure
of
the
act.
why
is
that
preceded
by
the
context
clause?
well,
petitioner
argues
in
its
brief
that
the
context
clause
is
sort
of
just
another
context
clause
like
40
some
other
federal
statutes
that
say
unless
the
context
otherwise
requires.
the
problem
with
that
is
this
court,
this
unanimous
court
in
marine
bank
in
1982
said
the
context
clause
had
considerable
importance.
it
was
the
bridge
for
the
application
of
the
economic
realities
test
to
the
very
instruments
that
the
court
would
have
to
consider
whether
or
not
it
constituted
a
security.
is
stock
lying
on
this
table,
on
counsel
table
a
security?
i
submit
it's
not.
i
submit
we
can't
tell.
we
have
to
look
at
the
transaction.
what
did
congress
say
in
the
legislative
history?
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
and
tell
this
court
that
congress
solved
this
problem
in
1933
and
1934.
in
fact,
i
think
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
discuss
this
problem
in
1933
and
1934
says
that
it
frankly
is
not
a
situation
where
we
have
an
abuse;
that
is,
where
a
purchaser
is
taking
over
a
hundred
percent
of
the
business
that
congress
intended
to
protect
with
the
acts.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i'm
not
arguing
that
this
is
exempt
because
it's
a
private
transaction.
in
fact,
i'm
not
arguing
it's
exempt
at
all.
i'm
arguing
that
because
of
the
economic
realities
of
this
transaction,
it
is
in
fact
not
a
security.
unquestionably
the
security
laws
apply
to
private
transactions
as
well
as
public
ones.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
the
williams
act
which,
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
applies
to
tender
offers,
i
submit
evidences
a
very
particular
congressional
intent
to
protect
persons,
non-sellers
or
investors
in
a
tender
offer
situation.
i
certainly
would
not
suggest
that
the
sale
of
business
doctrine
should
in
any
way
affect
the
requirement
under
the
williams
act
that
someone
in
a
takeover
or
tender
offer
situation
disclose
that
intent.
now,
the
next
level
is
whether
someone
who
takes
over
a
majority
interest
or
control
in
a
corporation
as
a
result
of
a
tender
offer
should
have--
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
whether
that
party
should
be
denied
the
protection
of
the
acts.
and
i
think
there's
a
threshold
question
there.
the
threshold
question
is
whether
the
economic
realities
test
should
be
applied
to
publicly
traded
stock.
i
think
logically
and
consistently
it
could
be
applied
to
publicly
traded
stock,
but
in
the
same
breath
i
recognize
that
congress
had
a
special
interest
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
market.
and
it
may
well
be
that
this
doctrine
should
be
confined
to
private
transactions.
and
in
marine
bank
this
court
in
1982
put
heavy
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
it
was
a
privately
negotiated
transaction.
and
i
think...
i
can't
deny
that
that's
important.
now,
what
are
the
economic
criteria
to
determine
the
existence
of
a
security
under
the
1933
and
1934
act?
well,
it
wasn't
long
after
those
acts
were
enacted
that
this
court
had
to
deal
with
that,
and
it
determined
that
the
criteria
was
whether
there
was
an
investment
in
a
common
venture
premised
upon
a
reasonable
expectation
of
profits
to
come
from
the
entrepreneurial
or
managerial
efforts
of
others.
now,
it's
critical
to
petitioner's
argument
to
confine
that
test,
which
has
been
used
at
least
five
times
by
this
court
starting
with
howey,
to
the
investment
contract
test
of
sec
v.
howey.
well,
i
submit
that
the
court
has
in
forman
spoken
to
that
and
said
in
talking
about
an
instrument,
admittedly
an
atypical
instrument
that
was
called
stock,
that
that
was
the
test
that
applied
to
all
of
its
decisions
regarding
what
was
a
security,
and
that
it
did
not
perceive
a
difference
between
that
test
and
the
test
to
be
applied
to
what
constituted
a
security.
applying
the
economic
realities
test
of
forman
to
this
case,
which
perhaps
presents
the
purest
instance
in
which
this
court
can
consider
this
issue,
and
it's
going
to
have
to
consider
ruefenacht
this
afternoon,
it
can
be
seen
first
and
foremost
that
there
is
no
common
enterprise
here.
and
the
court's
never
addressed
the
common
enterprise
requirement
before.
justice
white
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
from
the
denial
of
cert
in
the
mordaunt
case
which
was
submitted
in
january
of
this
year,
and
in
that
case
the
issue
was
whether
the
court
had
to
buy
vertical
commonality
or
horizontal
commonality
for
purposes
of
common
enterprise.
well,
fortunately,
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
after
the
date
of
this
sale
there
was
no
intertwining
of
investor
fortunes
between
the
petitioner
and
anyone
else,
either
my
client
or
any
other
investor.
that
is
not
typical
of
a
security.
secondly,
in
applying
the
economic
realities
to
this
case,
the
admitted
fact--
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
--what
it
means
is
i
would
agree
that
there
was
a
common
enterprise
and
that
that
requirement
would
be
satisfied,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
it
means
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
take
a
very
hard
look
whether
that
purchaser
objectively,
not
subjective
reliance
but
objectively
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
acquired
control
sufficient--
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
the
test
would
be
whether
or
not
the
purchaser
obtained
control
over
the
outcome
of
the
investment.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
oh,
in
that
instance
i
would
say
no.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
i've
totally
reversed
your
hypothetical.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
if
the
purchaser
obtained
60
percent--
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
i
believe
so.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
depending
upon
whether
that
51
percent
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
provided
actual
control
of
the
purchase.
that
may
not
depend
entirely
on
percentages.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
unless
there
was
some
sort
of
unique
veto
power
or
authority
to
run
the
business
given
to
the
purchaser.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
thank
you.
i
apologize
for
confusing
the--
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
--i'd
like
to
turn
for
a
minute
to
the
record
below,
because
i
think
this
court
should
be
quite
clear
what
case
it
has
before
it,
and
i'm
not
sure
it's
the
case
as
described
by
petitioner.
this
district
court...
and
i
submit
when
we
talk
about
burdens
on
courts,
this
district
court
acted
very
effectively
and
efficiently
in
analyzing
whether
or
not
control
passed
to
this
purchaser
at
closing.
it
told
the
parties
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
exchange
admissions
to
perfect
the
record,
and
here
is
what
the
petitioner
admitted
below:
"that
under
the
stock
purchase
agreement
my
clients
agreed
to
sell
100
percent
of
the
stock
in
landreth
timber
to
a
corporation
to
be
formed
by
the
purchasing
group;
that
they
agreed
to,
my
clients,
and
did
resign
as
officers
and
directors
of
ltc-1.
"
--that's
landreth
timber
company
1...
"that
none
of
the
respondents
became
officers,
directors,
shareholders
or
employees
of
the
acquiring
company
or
held
any
interest
in
it;
that
none
of
the
selling
parties
had
any
right
to
share
in
the
profits
or
losses
of
the
successor
corporation;
that
the
purchasing
group.
"
--which
mr.
quarles
has
described
as
mr.
sam
dennis
and
mr.
bolten
on
the
east
coast...
"in
fact
acted
prior
to
closing
and
hired
their
own
mill
manager
who
they
put
in
place
on
the
date
of
closing
who
ran
the
business;
and
that
ivan
landreth
was
retained
under
a
terminable
at
will
consulting
agreement
under
which
he
had
no
real
power
and
was
in
fact
terminated
within
two
months
of
the
date
of
closing.
"
we
submit
those
admissions
establish
rather
clearly
before
this
court
that
absolute
and
total
control
passed
to
the
purchaser
at
the
time
of
closing.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
some
major
principles
that
i
think
come
out
of
this
court's
decisions.
and
this
court
certainly,
despite
the
suggestion
to
the
contrary,
does
not
write
on
a
clean
slate
or
a
blank
slate
with
respect
to
the
propositions
urged
by
petitioner.
number
one,
no
case
that
this
court
has
decided
stands
for
the
proposition
asserted
by
the
sec
and
the
petitioner
that
so
long
as
an
instrument
is
named
in
the
acts
and
that
it
is
what
it
pretends
to
be...
that
is,
that
it
has
some
traditional
characteristics...
that
it
is
a
security
and
that
the
inquiry
ends.
in
fact,
the
sole
source
of
that
argument
is
a
single
sentence
in
the
joiner
decision
that
this
court
rendered
in
1943
before
its
decision
in
howey
in
1946.
and
in
that
case
the
court
said
instruments
may
be
included
within
any
of
these
definitions
as
a
matter
of
law
if
on
their
face
they
answer
to
the
name
or
description.
well,
the
same
argument
that's
been
made
to
this
court
today
was
made
to
this
court
in
forman
in
1975,
and
the
court
looked
at
precisely
that
language
and
here's
what
the
court
said
about
it:
by
using
the
conditional
words
"may"
and
"might"
in
these
dicta,
the
court
made
clear
that
it
was
not
establishing
an
inflexible
rule
barring
inquiry
into
the
economic
realities
underlying
a
transaction.
so
it's
petitioner
that's
coming
before
this
court
and
urging
what
essentially
is
a
new
rule;
that
is,
for
this
most
protected
type
of
instrument,
stock,
that
a
literal
characteristics
test
should
be
applied.
that's
never
been
applied
by
this
court
before.
and
what
road
does
it
send
the
court
down?
there's
been
much
said
about
the
line
drawing
that
district
courts
will
have
to
do
in
applying
the
economic
realities
test,
and
there
is,
incidentally,
no
line
drawing
on
the
basis
of
this
record.
but
what
road
does
the
court
have
to
go
down
if
it
adopts
a
literal
characteristics
test?
well,
the
court
would
establish,
i
suppose,
for
stock,
one
of
the
named
instruments
under
the
acts,
a
test
which
would
make
it
stock
simply
because
it
was
what
it
pretended
to
be
irrespective
of
the
economic
realities
of
the
transaction.
unfortunately,
the
court
would
still
have
the
investment
contract
test,
what
mr.
quarles
would
confine
to
be
the
investment
contract
test
of
howey,
which
the
forman
court
said
was
an
economic
realities
test
underlying
all
of
its
decisions,
and
it
would
have
to
determine
which
instruments
that
would
apply
to.
then
we've
got
marine
bank
v.
weaver
in
1982
where
the
court
looked
at
a
certificate
of
deposit
and
said
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case
that
that
was
not
a
security.
the
sec
and
petitioner
would
argue
with
respect
to
that
particular
decision
that
there
is
another
test
to
be
applied;
that
is,
the
overwhelming
scheme
of
federal
regulation;
that
because
the
federal
government
has
regulated
certificates
of
deposit,
they
can
be
accepted
from
the
acts.
and
then
we
would
have
to
decide
which
instruments
under
the
1933
and
'34
acts
are
typical
versus
atypical,
and
that's
a
definition
that
perhaps
counsel
can
share
with
us
in
his
rebuttal
time,
because
i
certainly
can't
provide
it
to
this
court.
in
each
of
its
six
decisions
from
1943
to
date,
including
the
joiner
case,
this
court
has
looked
at
the
underlying
transaction
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
security
existed.
it
did
so
with
assignments
of
oil
leases
and
promises
to
drill
in
joiner
in
1943.
it
did
so
in
sec
v.
howey
in
1946
regarding
a
citrus
grove,
sale
of
citrus
grove
units
coupled
with
service
contracts.
it
did
so
in
tcherepnin
v.
knight
in
1967
with
respect
to
something
called
shares,
withdrawable
capital
shares
in
a
savings
institution.
and
in
those
three
decisions
the
court
applied
correctly,
as
petitioner
would
say,
the
analysis
of
the
entire
transaction
in
order
to
expand
the
coverage
of
the
act,
not
restrict
it,
to
make
it
clear
that
those
named
instruments
aren't
all
that
there
was.
but
then
came
forman
in
1975
where
the
court
held
that
something
called
stock
quite
simply
was
not
a
security,
either
under
the
literal
characteristics
test
that
petitioners
proposed
or
under
the
investment
contract
test,
as
petitioners
call
it.
teamsters
v.
daniel
in
1979
the
court
addressed
a
noncontributory
pension
plan
and
determined
it
was
not
a
security.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
i
truly
think
not,
chief
justice.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
it
was
a
very
unusual
instrument.
i'd
readily
concede
that.
but
the
framework
of
the
forman
decision
came
up
from
the
second
circuit,
and
what
had
the
second
circuit
decided?
two
things:
that
number
one,
because
it
was
stock,
called
stock,
it
in
fact
should
be
a
security.
and
second,
that
if
it
was
not
stock
under
a
literal
characteristics
approach,
it
was
a
security
under
an
investment
contract
approach.
and
i
think
that
explains
the
framework
of
the
forman
decision.
and
in
both
parts
of
the
decision
the
court
reiterated
the
howey
test
and
said
we've
got
to
look
at
the
economic
realities
of
the
underlying
transactions.
and
i
think
forman
is
critical.
i
think
forman
is
critical
because
it
took
the
argument
that
the
howey
test
was
an
investment
contract
test,
and
it
said,
"we
perceive
no
difference
for
present
purposes
between
an
investment
contract
and
an
instrument
commonly
known
as
a
security.
"
it
went
on
to
say,
"the
test,
in
shorthand
form,
embodies
the
essential
attributes
that
turn
through
all
of
the
court's
decisions
defining
a
security.
"
i
think
forman
resolved
a
number
of
the
theoretical
arguments
that
are
being
made
now
by
petitioner.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
as
i
said
earlier,
justice
stevens,
i
think
when
we
get
into
publicly
traded
stock,
in
all
candor,
there
is
an
interest
exhibited
by
congress
in
the
'33
and
'34
acts
that--
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
--conceptually
the
logic's
identical,
but
i
think
there
might
be
good
reasons
that
this
court
should
decide
to
draw
the
line
with
private
transactions.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
now,
there's
something
else
about
this
howey
test,
this
economic
realities
test
which
i
submit
is
very
important
in
the
court's
resolution
of
this
case.
when
the
court
has
applied
this
test
it
has
determined
that
these
criteria,
this
investment
in
a
common
enterprise
with
a
reasonable
expectation
of
profits
to
come
from
the
efforts
of
others,
have
to
be
present
in
some
very
real
and
substantial
degree.
an
example:
in
1979
in
teamsters
v.
daniel
the
court
conceded
that
some
part
of
the
employee's
work
in
fact
was
an
investment.
it
went
into
the
pension
plan
which
would
ultimately
result
in
benefit
to
him.
but
the
court
said
what's
really
going
on
here?
and
what
the
court
stated
was
that
what
people
really
doing
is
working
for
a
living,
and
a
portion
of
their
wages
went
into
this
plan,
and
it's
not
a
significant
investment.
then
the
court
turned
to
the
question
of
whether
these
employees
were
relying
on
the
efforts
of
others
for
management
of
the
plan.
the
court
conceded
that
there
undoubtedly
was
some
reliance
on
the
efforts
of
others,
but
concluded
it
was
not
sufficient
to
meet
the
test.
marine
bank
even
more
emphatically
talked
about
just
in
what
degree
these
requirements
of
the
economic
realities
test
must
be
met
in
a
private
transaction.
there
the
court
said
that
the
purchaser,
who
unquestionably
was
dependent
upon
the
others
for
the
repayment
of
a
profit-sharing
agreement,
for
the
repayment
of
an
investment,
was
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
securities
acts
because
he
had
a
degree
of
control
that
was
inconsistent
with
the
court's
prior
decisions
on
what
was
a
security.
and
what
was
the
control
there?
well,
that
purchaser
didn't
manage
the
business.
the
purchaser
did
have
the
ability
to
use
a
pasture
and
horse
farm,
and
the
purchaser
did
have
the
ability
to
veto
future
loans.
and
the
court
stated
unanimously
in
1982
that
just
is
not
indicative
of
the
economic
criteria
we
find
to
constitute
a
security.
now,
in
applying
the
economic
realities
test
to
this
case,
i
first
would
state
that
i
believe
petitioner
has
to
convince
this
court
not
to
apply
the
economic
realities
test
to
stock
in
order
to
prevail.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
because
under
no
construction
of
the
common
enterprise
element
of
this
court's
decisions
under
the
economic
realities
test
is
there
a
common
enterprise
here.
and
as
the
court
may
be
aware,
the
debate
among
circuits
about
common
enterprise,
it's
sort
of
unquestioned
that
a
horizontal
pooling
of
funds
satisfies
the
common
enterprise
requirement.
the
question
arises
in
vertical
commonality,
how
involved
is
the
seller
with
the
purchaser
with
respect
to
the
outcome
of
the
investment.
we
don't
have
either
situation
here.
on
the
date
this
closed,
they
owned
the
entire
business.
they
owned
it
as
certainly
as
if
they
bought
that
equipment,
as
if
they
had
purchased
an
automobile
or
anything
else.
it
was
lock,
stock
and
barrel
theirs.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
i
think...
quite
admittedly,
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
negotiations
my
client
wanted
for
tax
reasons
to
have
it
be
a
stock
transaction.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
yes.
and
that's
entirely
correct.
i'd
like
to
turn
in
conclusion
to
what
makes
good
law,
because
ultimately
that
is
the
business
that
this
court
is
about.
both
sides
hurl
at
each
other
charges
of
inconsistency
and
illogic.
i
think
the
starting
point
that
this
court
must
recognize
if
it
adopts
petitioner's
position
in
this
case
and
the
position
of
the
sec,
which
has
been
on
both
sides
of
this
issue,
that
it
is
on
the
road
to
adopting
multiple
tests
for
those
17
instruments
under
the
act.
and
i
submit
that
if
congress
intended
a
multiplicity
of
tests,
it
would
have
given
some
particular
dignity
to
those
instruments
far
different
than
it
did
in
the
structure
of
the
act.
the
burden...
i
heard
mr.
quarles'
argument
a
number
of
times
about
the
burden
on
federal
courts.
anyone
who
has
litigated
a
10(b)(5)
case
to
a
conclusion
can
scarcely
suggest
that
the
burden
on
a
federal
court
that
properly...
under
properly
applied
criteria,
the
economic
realities
test
determines
that
something
is
or
is
not
a
security
in
the
context
of
a
hearing--
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
--i
certainly
do.
i
certainly
do,
chief
justice.
mr.
james
a.
smith,
jr.
it
certainly
has.
and,
in
fact,
with
that
perhaps
it's
a
good
time
for
me
to
sit
down.
i
appreciate
the
court's
attention.
