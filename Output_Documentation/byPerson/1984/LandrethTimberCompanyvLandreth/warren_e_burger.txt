mr.
quarles,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
quarles.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
forman,
the
opinion
in
forman
was
influenced
by
the
nature
of
what
was
sold
and
its
utility?
chief
justice
burger
it
wasn't
a
sawmill
type
of
an
operation,
was
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
don't
you
think
that
ten
cases
on
this
subject
with
five
each
way
apparently
has
been
a
burden
on
the
federal
courts
that
was
avoidable
if
there
had
been
a
single
rule?
chief
justice
burger
so
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
make
a
single
rule,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
two
minutes
remaining,
mr.
quarles.
we'll
finish
before
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
