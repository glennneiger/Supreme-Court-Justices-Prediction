we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
jensen
against
quaring.
ms.
galter,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
age,
is
that
not
another
factor?
chief
justice
burger
age.
chief
justice
burger
what
are
the
limits
in
nebraska?
chief
justice
burger
on
the
other
end,
is
there
a
limit?
chief
justice
burger
when
does
the
examination...
at
what
age
does
the
examination
begin?
chief
justice
burger
just
an
ordinary--
chief
justice
burger
--no,
but
on
the
other
end.
chief
justice
burger
a
medical
examination?
chief
justice
burger
i
know,
but
how
about
the
medical?
some
states
have
a
medical
examination
after
a
certain
age.
chief
justice
burger
when
did
nebraska
begin
to
require
a
photograph
on
the
driver's
license?
chief
justice
burger
and
when
did
they
first
begin
to
require
an
automobile
driver's
license?
long
before
your
time,
i
am
sure.
chief
justice
burger
would
this
same
rule
in
your
view
be
applied
if
nebraska
or
some
agency
of
the
federal
government
in
nebraska
or
in
the
eighth
circuit
required
a
photograph
for
identification
for
government
employment
or
for
a
passport?
the
same
standards
would
apply
across
the
board,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
burger
very
well.
mr.
lansworth.
chief
justice
burger
then
it
is
pretty
clear
she
considered
violating
the
law
less
important
than
violating
her
subjective
religious
belief.
chief
justice
burger
is
that
a
fair
statement?
chief
justice
burger
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
the
situation?
chief
justice
burger
would
you
agree
that...
what
is
your
view
on
whether
nebraska's
need
for
photographs
on
these
licenses
is
a
compelling
state
interest?
chief
justice
burger
you
think
it
would
not
make
it
easier
for
people
to
have
fraudulent
licenses?
chief
justice
burger
--how
about
for
federal
employment
which
required
in
a
particular
agency
a
photograph?
chief
justice
burger
if
she
were
here
today,
or
in
the
courts
in
nebraska,
and
newspaper
photographers
took
a
picture
of
her
as
she
was
leaving
the
courthouse,
could
she
enjoin
the
publication
of
that
in
your
view?
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
that
her
religious
belief,
her
rights
under
the
religion
clauses
are
subordinate
to
the
first
amendment
rights
of
others
to
take
her
picture
if
they
want
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
galter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
