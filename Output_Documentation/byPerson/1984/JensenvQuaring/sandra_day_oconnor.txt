justice
o'connor
may
i
ask,
ms.
galter,
if
you
could
explain
a
little
bit
more
to
me
about
the
administrative
burden
the
state
alleges
to
be
present.
i
think
the
brief
indicates
that
93
different
county
commissioners
would
have
to
administer
the
exceptions,
and
yet
the
respondent
cites
testimony
showing
that
the
current
practice
is
to
require
people
seeking
exemptions
to
apply
to
the
central
office.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
in
considering
exemptions
from
the
draft,
for
example,
based
on
sincerely
held
personal
beliefs,
the
same
kind
of
determination
is
made
at
a
variety
of
localities,
is
it
not?
justice
o'connor
that
hasn't
prevented
the
extension
of
a
similar
privilege
in
the
case
of
the
draft,
has
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
galter,
it
really
isn't
ms.
quaring's
driving
privilege
that
is
being
infringed,
is
it?
it
is
her
free
exercise
of
religion.
justice
o'connor
isn't
that
quite
a
valid
point?
justice
o'connor
the
burden
is
on
her
free
exercise.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
you
are
asking
the
court
to
do
something
that
i
don't
think
it
has
been
doing
in
earlier
cases.
if
you
concede
the
sincerity
of
the
religious
belief
or
practice,
do
we
really
go
beyond
that
and
say
how
important
is
that
really
to
the
average
person?
that
is
not
the
test,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
on
what?
justice
o'connor
on
her
free
exercise
of
her
religion.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
state's
interest
in
denying
the
exemption?
it
isn't
just
the
fact
that
the
state
wants
to
have
a
program
of
ready
identification.
i
guess
your
position
is,
it
is
the
administrative
burden.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
of
course
the
state
doesn't
have
a
uniform
photo
identification
system
now
because
it
has
already
been
demonstrated
that
the
state
has
exceptions
today,
for
temporary
learner's
permits
and
other...
out-of-state
permits
and
the
kind
of
thing
that
don't
require
a
photograph
today.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lansworth,
do
you
concede
that
the
government's
interest
in
obtaining
a
photograph
or
passport
or
some
ready
identification
for
security
reasons
in
a
secure
area
might
be
weighty,
or
weightier
than
the
state's
interest
for
driver's
license
purposes?
justice
o'connor
well,
those
are
the
suggested
circumstances,
the
passport
or
the
photograph
required
for
employment
in
a
secure
area.
justice
o'connor
mr.
lansworth,
what
about
a
person
whose
religious,
sincerely
held
religious
belief
is
that
one
should
not
have
one's
social
security
number
used
for
identification
purposes,
or
should
not
have
a
social
security
number
at
all,
and
wants
a
symbol
substituted?
would
you
think
that
that
would
fall
in
the
same
category
as
your
client's--
justice
o'connor
--do
you
think
that
part
of
the
balance
that
the
court
must
make
is
the
presence
or
absence
of
economic
or
other
motives
to
cause
people
to
claim
the
exemption?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
ms.
galter
suggested
one,
which
is
young
people
who
want
to
buy
liquor
under
age.
that
might
be
one.
