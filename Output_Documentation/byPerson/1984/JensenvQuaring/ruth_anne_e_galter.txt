ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
the
state
of
nebraska's
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
nebraska
contends
that
the
lower
court
erred
in
mandating
an
exception
solely
on
religious
grounds
to
nebraska's
requirement
that
a
photograph
appear
on
the
respondent's
driver's
license.
the
lower
court
found
two
compelling
interests
in
ready
and
instantaneous
identification
of
licensed
drivers
as
well
as
the
security
of
financial
transactions.
it
nevertheless
held
that
the
photograph
requirement
as
applied
to
mrs.
quaring
was
not
the
least
restrictive
alternative
to
accomplish
the
state's
objectives.
we
submit
that
the
lower
court
erred
in
two
respects.
first,
we
submit
that
it
failed
to
apply
a
qualitative
and
comparative
analysis
to
the
interests
of
the
state
and
mrs.
quaring.
secondly,
we
contend
that
it
incorrectly
applied
the
least
restrictive
alternative
test,
in
that
the
lower
court's
conclusion
rests
on
the
faulty
premise
that
a
few
exceptions
do
not
undermine
the
state's
legislative
purpose.
in
short,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
clarify
the
holdings
in
thomas
versus
review
board
and
in
sherbert
versus
verner
to
provide
a
qualitative
analysis
of
the
degree
of
abridgement
of
religious
freedom
in
terms
of
its
actual
interference
with
an
essential
practice
of
religion.
we
feel
this
is
significant
for
the
reason
that
the
lower
court
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
coercion
of
action
which
is
contrary
to
a
free
exercise
claim.
the
first
question
in
any
free
exercise
analysis
is,
is
there
a
burden.
our
focus
is
how
much
of
a
burden
exists
upon
mrs.
quaring.
in
that
analysis,
we
must
look
to
the
degree
of
infringement
or,
if
you
will,
the
centrality
of
her
belief
and
the
degree
which
the
state's
regulation
infringes
upon
that
central
core
belief.
we
have
also
evaluated
it
in
terms
of
the
right
to
drive.
as
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
have
indicated
that
we
do
not
feel
that
mrs.
quaring's
interest
in
the
right
to
a
driver's
license
is
on
the
same
level
as
those
interests
presented
in
thomas
versus
review
board
and
in
sherbert.
in
essence,
the
interest
or
the
benefits
at
issue
in
those
cases
were
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
which
the
individuals
were
otherwise
entitled.
we
feel
that
the
right
to
a
driver's
license
is
a
highly
regulated
state
activity.
it
is
subject
always
to
the
police
power
of
the
state,
subject
always
to
reasonable
regulations
which
relate
to
its
purpose.
in
other
words,
we
may
suspend
or
revoke
for
repeated
infractions.
we
may
impose
restrictions
in
terms
of
financial
responsibility.
it
is
subject
to
a
whole
host
of
state
regulation.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
age?
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
yes,
your
honor,
age
is
a
factor.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
at
the
age
of
16
you
may
obtain
a
regular
driver's
license.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
you
must
demonstrate
a
proficiency
and
knowledge
of
the
rules
of
the
road,
traffic
regulations.
you
must
demonstrate
a
certain
degree
of
visual
acuity.
you
must
also
demonstrate
your
manual
ability
to
actually
operate
a
motor
vehicle.
you
will
take
a
license--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--at
the
present
time,
no,
but
there
are
repeated
examinations
for
dexterity,
visual
ability,
and
so
on,
particularly
for
elderly
drivers.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
depending
upon
what
type
of
license
you
are
applying
for--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--the
ordinary
driver's
license
is
age
16.
you
may
get
a
learner's
permit
at
15.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
you
are
reexamined
every
four
years.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
the
visual.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
no,
we
do
not.
as
a
general
rule
we
do
not,
but
generally
examiners
will
take
into
account
any
physical
handicap,
and
if
there
is
a
discernible
one
to
the
examiner,
that
will
then
be
noted
on
the
driver's
license.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
mrs.
quaring
believes
a...
her
belief
is
a
personally
held
one.
she
does
not
belong
to
an
organized
religion
as
such,
and
the
church
to
which
she
does
occasionally
attend
does
not
subscribe
to
the
same
belief
that
she
does.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
the
state
has
conceded
that
it
is
a
religious
belief.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
a
judaic
christian
belief
founded
in
the
old
testament.
i
believe
as
well
the
lower
court's
opinion
indicated
a
judaic
background
for
this
belief.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
no,
your
honor.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
in
response
to
your
first
question,
the
administrative
burden
that
we
set
forth
would
be
that
the
applications
are
made
on
a
local
basis.
there
are
93
counties
in
nebraska.
applications
are
made...
actually
i
believe
there
are
95
examining
stations.
the
county
treasurers
and
their
clerical
staff
in
each
of
those
counties
actually
administer
the
photograph.
the
applications
would
be
made
locally.
the
testimony
below
does
indicate
that
the
applications
for
exemptions
that
have
been
made
have
been
made
to
the
central
office.
however,
in
implementing
an
administrative
scheme
of
statewide
applicability,
it
would
be
necessary
to
train
all
of
those
individuals
in
terms
of
processing
the
applications
and
making
the
determination.
it
would
be
unfeasible
for
an
individual
in
scott's
bluff,
nebraska,
to
travel
in
excess
of
300
miles
to
present
their
side
of
the
case,
unless
one
simply
had
a
statement
on
the
application
itself
which
would
in
our
estimation
result
in
exemption
on
demand,
simply
saying,
we
chose
not
to
be
photographed
for
our
religious
belief.
unless
one
goes
to
such
a
very
narrow
informational
statement
on
an
application,
you
do
have
exemption
on
demand.
our
concern
with
the
administrative
burden
is
that
we
would
have
in
excess
of
100
people
making
a
determination
as
to
what
is
or
is
not
religious.
the
problem
that
we
foresee
is
that
given
the
fact
that
we
are
recognizing
very
narrowly
held
beliefs,
that
the
risk
of
prejudice
and
the
risk
of
inconsistency
would
be
very
high,
and
those
are
legitimate
reasons
for
according
the
state's
interest
a
higher
weight,
if
you
will,
the
risk
of
prejudice
and
inconsistency
together
with
the
inability
of
those
individuals
to
determine
a
very
personal
belief
as
opposed
to
one
that
is
easily
recognized.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
that's
correct.
we
feel
that
the
implications
for
this
are
magnified
also
by
the
fact
that
all
50
states
now
require
or
will
require
as
of
january
photographic
licenses,
and
together
with
the
fact
that
the
numbers
of
people
who
would
be
making
this
determination
on
a
day
by
day
basis
is
extremely
difficult,
as
the
record
below
reflects.
professor
turner
indicated
that
indeed
it
was
a
very
difficult
task
to
determine
what
is
religious.
perhaps
it
might
be
easier
if
we
were
dealing
in
context
of
organized
religion.
for
example,
as
in
thomas
and
sherbert,
we
were
dealing
with
sabbatarians,
and
that
is
a
very
easily
recognized
religious
precept.
it
is
much
more
difficult
when
someone
simply
has
a
personal
belief
that
someone
may
not
be
familiar
with
or
have
enough
historical
background
to
make
a
fair
determination,
and
we
submit
that
the
risk
of
inconsistent
treatment
across
nebraska
as
well
as
the
nation
is
a
very
significant
factor
in
the
determination.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
no.
no,
it
has
not.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
i
believe
in
1977.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
am
sorry.
the
evidence
reflects
that
from
1977
on,
as
the
testimony
of
the
superintendent
of
the
state
patrol
indicated,
the
licenses
were
phased
in
over
a
four-year
period.
we
have
the
renewal
every
four
years.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
his
testimony
reflects
that
as
those
licenses
were
phased
in,
the
counterfeiting,
which
had
been
a
problem
prior
to
the
photographic
licenses,
the
counterfeiting
diminished,
as
did
the
purchase
of
alcohol
by
minors.
and
in
that
respect
i
think
one
of
the
potential
dangers
which
we
can
articulate
as
a
state
is
that
nebraska
has
just
raised
the
legal
drinking
age
from
19
to
21.
we
are
a
university
town,
if
you
will,
and
i
think
there
will
be
a
high
incentive
for
young
people
to
perhaps
fraudulently
obtain
nonphotographic
licenses
in
order
to
obtain
alcohol.
there
is
also
increasing
federal
pressure
on
various
states
to
raise
their
drinking
age
in
terms
of
the
use
of
highway
funds.
i
think
we
can
articulate
a
very
real
danger
in
that
regard,
that
there
would
be
a
potential
for
abuse,
and
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
determine
this
security.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
no,
it
does
not.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
yes,
she
is.
one
could
posit
an
equal
protection
argument
on
that.
the
other
side
of
that
would
be
whether
or
not
the
state's
interest
in
preventing
purchase
of
alcohol
is
sufficient,
although
you
would
then
also
be
discriminating
on
those...
against
those
individuals
in
terms
of
security.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
i
am
saying
you
could
pass
that
legislation.
i
think
you
would
raise
other
problems
that
would
perhaps
not
be
the
same
problems.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
the
photograph
serves...
its
primary
function
is
instantaneous
identification.
law
enforcement
officers
at
routine
traffic
stops
immediately
know
that
the
person
that
they
are
stopping
or
encountering
or
whatever
is
in
fact
the
person
displayed
upon
the
license.
it
is
an
instantaneous
identifier.
tangentially,
it
also
serves
purposes
of
identification
for
cashing
checks,
purchasing
alcohol,
admission
to
certain
other
things.
but
the
primary
identification
value
is
in
law
enforcement.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
the
state
offers
its
protection
in
terms
of
criminal
statutes,
in
terms
of
theft
by
deception,
forgery,
passing
bad
checks,
and
so
on.
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
integrity
of
the
commercial
system.
to
the
extent
that--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--the
driver's
license
serves
as
a
secondary
piece
of
identification.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
the
photograph
serves
as
the
identification.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
yes,
another
photograph
would,
if
it
were
properly
validated
by
a
state
or
a
federal
regulatory
authority,
so
that
it
had
validity.
i
don't
believe
a
simple
photograph
would
serve
the
same
function.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
i
think
the
main
emphasis
is
for
law
enforcement
and
the
identification
of
drivers.
it
does
serve
corollary
purposes,
and
to
that
extent
those
also
are
compelling,
and
i
believe
the
lower
court
so
found,
that
the--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--i
am
not
personally
familiar.
that
may
very
well
be.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
i
would
be
here
making
the
same
argument,
because,
yes,
i
think
it
does
create
problems.
we
also
feel
that
the
lower
court
was
in
error
in
applying
the
least
restrictive
alternative
analysis
to
indicate
that
if
we
have
only
a
very
few
exceptions,
it
doesn't
significantly
undermine
the
state's
interest.
the
faulty
rationale
is
that
if
we
had
a
larger
number,
we
might
not
very
well
be
able
to
make
the
exception
without
running
afoul
of
the
establishment
clause.
the
court's
decision
below
has
the
strange
result
of
giving
more
protection
to
a
very
unusual
doctrinaire
belief,
if
you
will,
that
does
not
fit
well
within
established
notions
of
religion.
so
i
think
if
we
had
15,000
people
or
500
people
making
the
same
request,
the
analysis
would
change.
and
we
submit
that
ought
not
be
the
test
that
is
applied.
the
decision
ought
not
turn
on
the
few
number
of
people
that
request
the
exemption.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
state
could
always
make
an
exception
if
only
one
or
two
asked
for
it.
it
wouldn't
seriously
undermine
the
integrity.
but
what
we
are
most
concerned
with
is,
we
are
concerned
with
this
case,
we
are
concerned
with
future
cases.
counsel
is
aware
in
nebraska
of
individuals
who
now
do
not
want
to
sign
their
driver's
license
on
religious
grounds.
there
are
individuals
who
do
not
want
a
social
security
number
on
religious
grounds.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
yes,
i
believe
they
would.
it
also
depends
on
the
purpose,
and
when
you
have
government
requiring
them
for
different
reasons,
the
driver's
license
serves
an
identification
purpose
for
enforcement.
we
also
as
state
employees
have
photographic
id's
for
security
reasons,
and
that
is
why
we
would
like
to
posit
a
test
which
really
examines
on
the
one
hand
the
degree
of
infringement
of
an
individual's
essential
practice
of
religion.
we
submit
the
state
has
not
interfered
with
the
practice
of
mrs.
quaring's
religion.
she
is
free
to
worship
as
she
pleases.
she
may
decorate
her
home,
and
avoid
all
indications
of
things
in
creation.
to
answer
your
question,
on
the
other
hand,
we
need
to
examine
the
interests
of
government.
we
have
identification
as
one.
we
have,
as
the
justice
department
has
pointed
out,
a
programmatic
interest
in
universal
applicability
of
laws.
the
use
of
numbers,
for
example.
fifteen
states
now
utilize
a
social
security
number
as
the
driver's
license
number.
and
given
the
widespread
use
of
computerization,
those
numbers
are
the
only
way
in
which
this
information
is
accessed.
that
also
brings
up
driving
records,
which
are
very
important
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
when
he
stops.
if
he
has
that
information
available
to
him
at
a
central
location,
he
knows
if
he
is
looking
at
a
repeated
offender.
the
interests
of
government
are
much
broader
than
just
the
photograph.
the
government
has
a
very
strong
interest
in
uniform
applicability,
and
i
believe
that
was
set
forth
rather
clearly
in
united
states
versus
lee,
in
which
an
exemption
was
not
granted
to
the
amish
because
they
had
elected
to
enter
a
commercial
activity,
and
the
viability
of
the
system
as
a
whole
was
important.
and
that
is
what
we
are
positing,
that
you
look
at
the
very
degree
of
burden
on
mrs.
quaring,
and
we
submit
that,
yes,
we
have
not
allowed
her
to
have
a
driver's
license.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
not
interfered
so
strongly
with
the
practice
of
her
belief
that
the
government
must
give
way
and
make
an
exception.
the
government's
interest
is--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--and
did
not
want
their
photograph
taken?
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
yes,
it
would,
most
definitely,
but
we
also
do
not
have
a
problem
in
lifetime
revocations
of
licenses,
and
i
would
agree
with
you
that
the
analysis
is
different,
but
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
interest
of
the
license,
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
dixon
versus
love
in
indicta,
it
has
been
indicated
that
perhaps
a
driver's
license
is
not
so
important
as
our
social
welfare
benefits,
which
is
a
subsistence
question.
in
your
example,
the
chauffeur
might
have
to
make
a
lifestyle
adjustment,
but
those
are
not
sufficient
reasons.
economic
disadvantage
or
inconvenience
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
to
grant
the
exemption.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
no,
and
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
we
would
point
out.
it
is
a
sliding
scale
analysis.
it
truly
is.
you
do
not
want
the
picture
on
your
license.
but
if
in
fact
mrs.
quaring
were
involved
in
an
accident
and
taken
to
the
police
station,
i
doubt
very
much
that
the
state
would
be
forced
to
forego
the
photograph
on
her
mug
shot.
i
don't
mean
to
be
facetious,
but
it
is
a
sliding
scale
analysis.
the
state's
interest
then
becomes
very
high.
we
submit
that
now
the
state's
interest
is
very
high,
and
the
burden
on
mrs.
quaring
is
not
so
central.
we
are
not
interfering
with
the
practice.
and
i
think
it
is
significant
that
the
lower
court
specifically
found
no
coercion
of
action.
and
given
those
reasons,
we
feel
that
the
test
to
be
applied
is
consistent
with
thomas
and
sherbert.
we
feel
that
it
can
be
clarified
in
terms
of
an
analysis
of
the
comparative
burdens
and
the
comparative
costs.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
that
is
the
respondent's
claim.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
the
burden
on
mrs.
quaring,
if
you
will...
we
submit
that
there
is
not
a
right
to
drive,
but
yes--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--the
burden
is
on
her
free
exercise,
but
what
we
are
urging
the
court
to
examine
is
how
much,
how
much
are
we
interfering
with
the
actual
practice?
i
would--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--i
believe
the
test
would
be...
the
initial
question
is,
is
there
a
burden,
and
then--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--the
burden
on--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--on
free
exercise
of
her
religion.
but
the
court
has
been
willing
in
other
cases,
such
as
braunfeld
versus
brown,
to
say
even
though
there
is
a
burden,
and
even
though
it
is
inconvenient,
and
even
though
it
is
expensive,
the
state's
interest
is
so
compelling
that
the
individual's
interest
must
give
way.
so,
yes,
i
think
the
court
has
been
looking
at
a
balancing
test,
and
perhaps
we
are
only
asking
for
a
more
refined
balancing
test.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
it
is
the
administrative
burden
as
the
state's
broader
interest
in
achieving
universal
application
and
extending
that
rationale
into
social
security
numbers,
signatures,
and
so
on.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
we
have
exceptions.
however,
those
exceptions
bear
a
rational
relationship
for
the
reasons
that
they
were
carved
out.
we
submit
that
it
is
well
within
the
legislature's
authority
to
make
the
determination
to
grant
those
limited
exceptions.
for
example,
the
learner's
permits
are
only
valid
if
they
are
accompanied
by
a
regularly
licensed
driver
who
has
a
photograph
on
his
or
her
license.
the
temporary
permits
are
for
those
individuals
who
are
out-of-state
and
of
necessity
could
not
be
photographed
in
nebraska.
they
are
short-term
in
nature.
when
that
individual
returns
to
the
state,
he
then
obtains
a
regular
license.
we
submit
that
the
legislature
has
the
ability
to
make
that
determination.
having
once
made
that
determination,
by
contrast,
it
chose
not
to
grant
a
religious
exemption.
that
may
have
been
a
better
course
of
action,
but
we
are
not
required
to
do
that,
and
that
is
a
legislative
determination.
and
we
feel
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
force
the
state
to
grant
an
exception
solely
on
religious
grounds.
and
the
other
exemptions
may
be
explained
on
a
rational
basis
as
within
the
authority
of
the
legislature.
the
notion--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
exactly.
i
believe
it
is
exemption
on
demand,
and
i
think
the
incentive
for
counterfeiting
and
the
incentive
for
abuse
will
increase,
and
the
testimony
below
reflected
that
the
purchase
of
alcohol
was
one
of
those,
and
yes,
i
think
that
is
exactly
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
are
articulating
that
the
exemption
would
be
on
demand.
there
would
be
no
way
for
local
licensing
authorities
to
make
the
determination.
we
also
submit
that
given
the
establishment
clause,
it
would
be
an
impermissible
inquiry
on
such
a
broad
scale.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
briefly,
your
honor.
for
purposes
of
clarification
of
the
record,
to
the
extent
that
this
court
deems
it
important
that
the
legislature
has
carved
out
exemptions,
there
is
reference
made
to
exceptions
for
limited
permits
with
restricted
or
minimal
ability.
that
is
not
correct,
and
it
is
not
supported
in
the
record.
and
at
page
91
of
the
record
you
will
find
that
limited
or
restricted
permits
are
not
particularly
well
defined
in
the
record,
but
those
operator's
licenses
do
have
photographs
on
them.
so
that
is
one
exception
that
is
incorrectly
characterized
in
the
record
below.
in
closing,
we
would
stress
that
the
least
restrictive
alternative
test
ought
be
examined
in
terms
of
the
overall
objective
sought
to
be
accomplished,
and
if
one
looks
at
this
in
a
means-end
analysis,
the
end
result
is
identification.
the
means
is
a
photograph.
it
is
conceded
that
the
photograph
is
the
only
identifier
which
will
achieve
that
goal
as
well.
in
examining
whether
or
not
we
make
an
exemption,
we
have
to
be
very
careful
about
looking
at
just
one
or
two
exemptions,
and
look
at
the
future
impact
of
granting,
number
one,
exemptions
on
demand,
and
other
kinds
of
exemptions,
such
as
numbers
or
signatures
or
photographs
on
security
documents
or
security
cards
for--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--concentrating
on
photographs
alone--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--yes,
we
would.
the
state's
interest
is
very
high
in
having
an
instantaneous
identifier.
the
other
interest
in
government,
and
i
think
perhaps
it
is
an
interest
for
religious
freedom,
is
not
having
100
odd
officials
across
the
state
of
nebraska
determining
whether
or
not
someone
really
holds
a
religious
belief.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
i
don't
think
they
are
rare
enough,
and
i
think
the
incentive
for
an
increased
number
is
going
to
be
present.
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
more
requests,
and
it
would
be
unworkable
to
have
the
central...
if
the
central--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--one
could.
one
could
also
make
the
application
much
more
difficult.
it
is
not
possible
in
a
geographic
state
as
nebraska
to
do
these
other
than
at
local
levels,
and
the
intrusion,
the...
aside
from
the
high
cost
to
government
of
implementing
an
administrative
mechanism
to
implement
this,
i
think
the
very
high
degree
of
intrusion
into
people's
beliefs
at
that
level
is
impermissible,
and
i
think
that
we
ought
not
do
that.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
one
could
post
a
number
of
requirements.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
it
would
be
possible
on
one
or
two
or
three,
but
to
implement
that
kind
of
a
program
in
93
counties
presents
a
tremendous
cost
to
the
state
of
nebraska,
and
it
is
a
tremendous
intrusion
of
government
into
people's
lives.
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
i
am
afraid
there
are
more
coming.
i
don't
think
we
can--
ms.
ruth
anne
e.
galter
--they
are
not
here
yet,
your
honor.
any
other
questions?
thank
you.
