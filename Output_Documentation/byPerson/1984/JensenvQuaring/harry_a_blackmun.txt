justice
blackmun
counsel,
why
is
the
state
interested
in
the
financial
transactions
of
cashing
checks?
justice
blackmun
yes,
but
what
has
the
driver's
license
to
do
with
that,
really?
anybody
can
get
a
driver's
license.
justice
blackmun
because
of
the
photograph.
justice
blackmun
a
passport
would
do
the
same
thing,
wouldn't
it?
justice
blackmun
i
will
confess
i
am
a
little
puzzled
by
your
reliance
on
financial
transaction
integrity
to
support
the
photograph
on
a
driver's
license.
justice
blackmun
am
i
not
correct
that
in
some
parts
of
asia
there
are
sects
who
will
not
permit
people
to
photograph
them?
justice
blackmun
and
if
you
had
a
large
number
of
people
in
nebraska,
would
that
create
additional
problems
for
you,
or
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument?
justice
blackmun
has
mrs.
quaring
ever
applied
for
a
passport?
justice
blackmun
and
you
know
a
photograph
is
required
for
those.
would
she
be
challenging
the
federal
procedure
for
photographs
on
passports
if
she
wanted
to
go
to--
justice
blackmun
you
have
your
sack
air
force
base
in
your
state.
justice
blackmun
what
is
your
response
to
that
situation?
justice
blackmun
i
don't
think
it's
if.
i
think
it
is
required.
justice
blackmun
let
me
ask
another
question,
if
you
place
a
great
deal
of
weight
on
the
existence
of
other
exemptions
in
the
nebraska
system.
justice
blackmun
of
course,
aren't
each
and
every
one
of
those
exemptions
rather
minor?
they
are
temporary
in
nature,
and--
justice
blackmun
--there
is
a
certain
element
of
impossibility
with
respect
to
some
of
them,
anyway.
justice
blackmun
is
that
your
approach
to
the
case?
you
accept
the
findings
on
the
first
two
prongs,
that
there
is
an
important
state
interest
being
the
second
one?
justice
blackmun
so
the
case
gets
down
to
a
less
restrictive
alternative
then.
