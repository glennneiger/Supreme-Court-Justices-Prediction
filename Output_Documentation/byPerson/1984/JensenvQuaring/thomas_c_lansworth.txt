mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
answer
to
the
question
from
chief
justice
burger
with
regard
to
when
the
licensing
photograph
requirement
took
effect,
that
began
in
january
of
1978.
mrs.
quaring
at
that
time
was
driving
on
a
license
that
was
issued
under
the
prior
statute,
which
did
not
require
a
photograph,
and
she
continued
to
do
that,
as
the
evidence
at
trial
indicated,
for
a
period
of
four
years.
this
woman
then,
because
of
her
religious
belief,
was
placed
in
a
situation
where
she
drove
her
farm
vehicles
and
her
automobile
on
what
essentially
was
an
expired
license,
with
the
completed
examination
certificate
indicating
that
she
had
passed
the
examination
stapled
to
it.
i
mention
that
simply--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--i
think,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--excuse
me?
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
that
what
i
would
draw
from
that
is
that
she
had
such
a
high
level
of
concern
about
the
situation
in
which
she
was
placed
that
she
went
to
the
trouble
of
doing
the
next
best
thing
in
her
mind.
and
that
is,
she
had
passed
the
examination.
she
had
qualified
under
all
of
the
substantive
requirements
in
order
to
obtain
a
renewed
driver's
license
at
that
time,
but
she
was
not
able
to
get
a
renewed
driver's
license
because
her
religious
beliefs
prevented
her
from
submitting
to
being
photographed.
mrs.
quaring
and
her
husband
operate
a
large
farming
operation
in
central
nebraska,
where
they
live
under
what
might
truly
be
called
the
wide
open
spaces.
the
ability
to
drive
a
motor
vehicle
in
those
circumstances
is
essential
to
her
ability
to
continue
to
work
as
both
a
farmer
and
in
her
part-time
employment
as
a
bookkeeper
in
a
small
town
that
is
located
approximately
ten
miles
from
where
she
and
her
husband
farm.
she
operates
both
the
automobiles
and
various
vehicles
in
the
farming
operation.
she
needs
to
be
able
to
drive.
i
think
that
as
far
as
whether
or
not
this
is
a
question
of
whether
she
is
just
simply
trying
to
impose
some
kind
of
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
state,
i
don't
think
that
is
an
issue
here.
she
is
not
a
woman
who
has
ever
before
found
herself
in
a
court
of
law.
the
evidence
indicates
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
she
has
ever
been
confronted
with
a
legal
problem,
not
only
in
general,
but
specifically
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
she
presents
any
danger
to
the
state's
interest
with
regard
to
licensing
motor
vehicle
operators.
she
has
never
been
the
recipient
of
any
kind
of
traffic
citation.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
we
have...
my
personal
position
on
that
is
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
that
is
a
compelling
state
interest.
since
the
lower
courts
were--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--i
think
it
is
a
step
that...
the
photograph
makes
it
more
difficult
to
create
fraudulent
licenses,
but
the
testimony
by
the
superintendent
of
the
nebraska
state
patrol
at
trial
indicated
that
that
event
still
happens,
that
there
are
still
fraudulent
licenses
that
are
being
made.
and
i
think
that
as
far
as
the
questions
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
spurious
claims
might
be
made
so
that
people
can
somehow
have
fraudulent
identifications,
i
doubt
that
people
would
want
an
identification
to
go
out
and
write
bad
checks,
if
that
is
the
states'
concern,
that
did
not
have
a
photograph.
my
suspicion
would
be
that
the
fraudulent
licenses
that
exist
have
pictures
on
them
of
the
people
who
are
carrying
them,
but
the
other
information
has
been
somehow
counterfeited,
and
it
is
not
the
photograph
that
is
the
subject
of
counterfeiting
in
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
is
there
any
faster
method
of
identification?
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
that
probably
there
is
not.
however,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
simply
a
question
of
speed
of
identification
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
burdens
being
placed
on
mrs.
quaring's
free
exercise
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
in
addition,
i
think
that
a
person
who--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
that
it
is
probably
the
fastest
way.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
any
better
than
the
physical
description
that
appeared
on
the
previous
license
form.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
in
that
situation,
i
think
i
would
prefer
a
photograph.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
but
i
don't
think
that
a
preference
for
a
photograph--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--no,
she
has
not,
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
if
she
were
to
make
application
for
a
passport,
my
suspicion
is
that
her
position
with
regard
to
the
photograph
on
that
document
would
be
the
same
with
regard...
as
it
is
with
regard
to
the
driver's
license.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
for
mrs.
quaring,
as
the
individual,
particular
individual
who
is
involved
in
this
case,
her
position
would
be
that
she
cannot
allow
herself
to
be
photographed.
so,
in
any
situation
in
which
someone
would
impose
a
photographic
requirement,
her
position
would
be
the
same
as
it
has
been
with
regard
to
the
driver's
license.
and
i
would...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
interests
involved
in
those
photographs
is
going
to
vary
from
situation
to
situation.
but
with
regard
to
the
state's
interest
that
is
involved
in
the
photograph
on
the
driver's
license,
it
seems
clear
to
me,
particularly
from
the
record
in
this
case,
that
with
the
exemptions
that
already
exist
under
the
statute,
and
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
mrs.
quaring
as
an
individual
presents
any
threat
to
those
interests,
with
or
without
a
photograph,
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
she
does
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
it
would
be
different.
whether
or
not
it
is
weightier,
i
think,
would
depend
upon
the
particular
situation
in
which
the
requirement
might
arise,
and
also
we
are
dealing
in
this
particular
case
with
a--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--it
is
my
understanding
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
an
exemption
to
a
photograph
on
passports.
i
am
not
a
frequent
traveler,
so
i
am
not
personally
aware
of
whether
that
in
fact
is
the
law.
with
regard
to
the
security
photograph,
if
that
was
the
uniform
system
that
had
been
established,
and
if
it
was
equally
applicable
to
all,
and
that
it
was
a
necessity
for
entrance
to
a
secure
area,
or
something
of
that
nature,
then
i
think
it
would
be
weightier
in
that
situation
than
the
license
photograph--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
if
a
photograph
was
required
for
entrance
at
sack
air
force
base?
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
that
may
be
the
case.
you
are
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
that
the
weight
that
i
place
on
that
is
because
of
the
reason
that
that
indicates
to
me
that
the
addition
of
mrs.
quaring
to
that
group
of
people
who
is
on
the
highways
and
streets
of
nebraska
without
a
photograph
on
their
driver's
license
is
not
going
to
have
any
impact
upon
the
achievement
of
the
state's
interests
that
are
being
served
by
that
photograph.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
generally
speaking
most
of
them
would
fit
that
description,
except
there
is
a
category--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--i
think
with
regard
to...
the
temporary
permit
i
believe
is
the
one
that
is
issued
to
persons
who
are
outside
of
the
state
at
the
time
that
their
renewal
comes
due.
the
others,
however,
are
not
temporary
in
the
sense
of
a
period
of
days
or--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--the
learner's
permit,
your
honor,
i
believe,
is
issued
for
a
year
at
a
time.
it
is
issued
generally
to
a
15-year-old
who
then
learns
to
drive
before
reaching
the
age
of
16,
and
being
able
to
obtain
a
regular
driver's
license.
that
is...
i
guess
i
don't
consider
that
a
year
is
a
short
period
of
time
with
regard
to
driving
on
the
streets
and
highways
without
a
photographic
license.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
yes,
your
honor.
the
normal
period
of
time
is
four
years.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
she
could.
i
think
the
first
amendment
would
protect
the
newspaper's
right
to
publish
that
photograph.
i
think
that
if
she
were
here
today,
she
would
attempt
to
avoid
that
event,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
reasons
that
she
is
not
here
today
is
that
possibility.
but
i
think
her
position
and
her
testimony
at
trial
indicates
that...
a
question
very
similar
to
that
was
asked
of
her
at
trial,
and
her
response,
as
i
recall
it,
was
that
she
would
attempt
to
avoid
that
event,
but
that
if
it
occurred,
it
would
be
distressing
to
her
with
regard
to
her
religious
beliefs,
but
it
would
not
be
to
her
the
kind
of
religious
burden
that
being
forced
to
submit
to
a
photograph
in
order
to
obtain
this
particular
state
extended
privilege
would
be.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
that
in
the
question
that
you
posed
with
regard
to
a
news
photograph
being
taken
of
her,
you
don't
have
involved
in
that
situation
any
governmental
action
that
is
burdening
her
exercise.
rather,
you
have
the
competing
interests
of
two
private
parties,
both
of
whom
have,
it
seems
to
me,
equal
footing
under
the
first
amendment
with
regard
to
the
activities
that
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
it
could
fall
in
the
same
category.
there
are
a
number
of
situations
that
have
arisen
in
the
courts
around
the
country
that
involve
just
that
issue,
as
i
know
you
are
aware.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
to
whether
or
not
one
can
be
exempted
from
the
requirement
of
the
social
security
number
has
to
do
with
what
the
interests
being
served
by
that
number
are
as
they
are
asserted
by
the
government
in
that
situation,
and
also
it
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
facts
in
a
given
situation
demonstrate
that
whatever
the
system
being
served
by
that
number
is,
whether
it
will
be
able
to
function
without
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
the
court
certainly
in
recent
years
have
indicated
a
concern
with
that
motivation,
and
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
concern.
the
court
has
repeatedly
said,
or
at
least
discussed
from
cases
beginning
as
long
ago
as
sherbert
through
the
recent
decisions
in
thomas
and
lee
what
happens
if
people...
if
we
grant
exemptions
and
people
are
then
placed
in
a
situation
where
they
can
be
exempted
from
paying
the
taxes,
and
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
concern.
and
i
think
that
is
a
concern
that
i
find
very
difficult
to
see
in
this
particular
case.
it
is
very,
very
hard
for
me
to
see
what
in
the
world
is
the
incentive
for
someone
to
spuriously
request
an
exemption
from
a
photograph.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
that
might
be
one,
and
i
would
agree
that
she
has
suggested
that,
but
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
to
suggest
that
that
is
a
real
possibility
in
this
case,
and
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
in
this
case
to
suggest
that
mrs.
quaring
presents
any
law
enforcement
difficulty.
i
realize
that
the
court
does
not
simply
look
at
mrs.
quaring.
but
again,
i
think
that
with
regard
to
the
illegal
purchase
of
alcohol,
that
the
person
who
is
seeking
to
do
that
would
most
likely
want
to
have
a
photograph
on
their
license
that
looks
like
them,
and
that
they
might
want
to
counterfeit
their
age,
for
example,
on
the
license
rather
than
their
appearance.
it
has
been
my
experience,
longer
ago
now,
i
guess,
than
i
wish,
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--that
retailers
usually
were
very
strict
about
requiring
identification,
and
if
there
was
anything
fishy
or
questionable
about
someone's
identification,
they
would
refuse
to
do
business
with
them,
particularly
in
a
young
person
purchasing
alcohol
situation.
so
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
see
that
granting
an
exemption
in
this
case
would
create
a
situation
where
that
kind
of
transaction
would
really
be
a
threat
to
the
interests
that
are
served
by
the
state
here.
i
think
that
the
argument
that
the
state
officials,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
made
would
require
the
court
to
reverse
what
it
has
said
in
cases
such
as
sherbert
versus
verner
or
thomas
versus
review
board.
the
court
has
not
indicated
that
it
is
willing
to
consider
that,
as
far
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
the
court.
and
the
burdens
that
were
placed
upon
the
exercise
of
the
individuals'
religious
beliefs
in
those
cases
it
seems
to
me
are
nearly
identical
to
what
they
are
here.
the
court
did
not
examine
the
quality
of
the
burden.
rather,
it
examined
the
quality
of
the
state's
interest
and
whether
or
not
that
interest
could
be
served
by
some
means
that
is
less
restrictive
of
the
religious
believer's
free
exercise
of
his
or
her
beliefs.
to
suggest
that
you
have
to
somehow
evaluate
whether
or
not
the
burden
is
big
or
small
or
heavy
or
light
i
think
is
really
begging
the
question.
the
analysis
that
this
court
has
traditionally
followed
throughout
its
decisions
in
free
exercise
cases
is
that
you
determine
whether
there
is
a
burden
upon
the
exercise
of
the
religion.
you
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
some
compelling
state
interest
served
by
that
requirement
that
is
burdensome
to
the
exercise,
and
finally,
whether
or
not
that
interest
can
be
served
in
some
way
that
is
less
restrictive
of
the
exercise
of
a
religious
belief.
the
lower
courts,
both
the
lower
courts
in
this
particular
case
have
found
that
there
exists
a
burden
on
a
religious
exercise.
they
have
also
found
that
there
exist
compelling
or
important,
as
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
said,
interests
that
are
served
by
the
photographic
requirement
here,
but
they
have
also
both
made
specific
findings
that
those
interests
can
be
served
in
some
means
less
restrictive.
in
this
particular
case,
that
less
restrictive
means
is
an
exemption
from
the
photographic
requirement.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
we
have
taken
that
position
in
this
court.
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
personally,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
see
that
it
is
compelling,
but
since
the
decision
extended
the
exemption
to
mrs.
quaring,
that
was
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
it
is
not
served
equally
well
without
the
photograph,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
an
overall
program
of
identification,
and
the
overall
program
of
identification
can
be
served
equally
well
and
achieved
equally
well
with
a
limited
number
of
exceptions.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
that
the
fewer
the
number,
the
less
problem
you
have
with
continuing
the
programmatic
interest,
but
i
wouldn't
make
that
the
test
if
that
is
your
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
mrs.
quaring's
particular
faith?
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
the
record
in
this
case
indicated
that
one
of
the
career
persons
in
this
motor
vehicle
division
was
aware
of
her
claim
and
perhaps
one
other
one
during
his
tenure.
so
i
think
that
this
is
a
situation
where
the
numbers
are
certainly
small.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
has
said
that
numbers
is
the
test.
but
i
think
that
numbers
are
one
of
the
measures
with
regard
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--i
think
numbers...
the
number
of
exemptions
which
might
be
possible
is
one
measure
of
whether
or
not
the
impact
will
be
so
great
upon
the
state's
ability
to
achieve
its
interests
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
--that's
correct,
but
i
think
there
are
situations
where
numbers
are
not
the
only
situation
or
the
only
consideration.
for
example,
the
court's
decision
in
the
recent
lee
case
is
one
of
those
where
the
court
has
indicated
in
that
opinion
that
it
is
very
concerned
with
regard
to
any
kind
of
exemption
from
taxing
systems
within...
certainly
on
the
national
level.
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
situation
in
which
numbers
would
not
be
the
determinant,
and
the
court,
if
it
didn't
directly
state
that,
i
think
it
clearly
indicated
that
there
are
some
types
of
programmatic
interests
that
are
so
universal
in
nature,
particularly
the
tax
system
being
one
such
example,
that
we
are
not
going
to
entertain
exemptions
to
them
other
than
those
that
congress
itself
creates.
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
it
could
have...
that
the...
in
terms
of
the
numbers
involved?
mr.
thomas
c.
lansworth
i
think
that
my
reaction
to
the
facts
in
the
lee
case
was
similar
to
what
i
in
fact
remember
you
writing,
your
honor,
which
is
that
it
was
difficult
to
see
how
this
was
going
to
impact
in
any
negative
way
upon
the
social
security
system,
but
i
think
that
the
court
had
another
consideration
in
mind
in
that
opinion,
which
was
that
if
you
begin
to
make
exceptions
to
any
kind
of
national
tax
system
in
a
nation
such
as
ours
where
tax
systems
operate
on
a
primarily
voluntary
payment
system,
that
you
are
leading
into
a
very
troubled
area.
i
think
that
was
a
consideration
that
led
the
court
in
that
case
on
the
facts
of
that
case
to
come
to
the
result
they
came
to
in
that
opinion.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
i
guess
i
would
simply
say
again
that
the
lower
courts
in
both
instances
in
this
case
have
applied
the
analysis
that
has
been
stated
by
this
court
throughout
its
free
exercise
decisions,
and
that
this
court
should
affirm
that
result.
thank
you.
