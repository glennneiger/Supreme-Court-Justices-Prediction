ms.
galter,
is
any
part
of
the
state's
argument
based
on
the
idea
that
where
you
have
a
fairly
minimal
time
period
of
confrontation
between
the
licensing
authority
and
the
applicant,
that
the
state
may
find
itself
in
a
position
of
just
having
to
give
in
on
a
lot
of
claims
that
are
either
spurious
or
borderline
spurious?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
people
who
perhaps
have
ulterior
motives
and
really
aren't
all
that
interested
in
religious
claims
find
out
that
you
can
get
a
driver's
license
with
no
photograph
on
it,
that
you
will
get
a
lot
of
applications
based
on
stated
religious
belief
that
in
fact
doesn't
exist
but
may
be
very
difficult
to
disprove.
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
is
shorter
than
the
period
of
time
that
a
normal
nebraska
driver's
license
runs,
though,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
that
is
the
way
you
worked
it?
