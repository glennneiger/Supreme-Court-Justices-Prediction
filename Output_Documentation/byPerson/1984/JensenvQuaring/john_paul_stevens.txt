justice
stevens
couldn't
you
respond
to
that
by
just
limiting
the
exclusion
for
this
purpose
to
adults,
i
mean,
to
those
over
21,
saying
you
have
a
special
interest
there?
this
case
doesn't
raise
that
question,
does
it?
justice
stevens
she
is
older,
i
gather.
justice
stevens
surely
if
you
say
that
interest
is
sufficient
to
deny
everybody
the
right
not
to
be
photographed,
it
ought
to
be
at
least
sufficient
to
deny
those
under
21
the
right.
justice
stevens
exactly
what
is
the
state...
spell
out
for
me
if
you
would,
please,
in
a
practical
sense
what
function
does
the
photograph
serve?
justice
stevens
all
right.
would
you
tell
me
again
how...
the
purpose
of
the
photo
identification,
as
i
understand
it,
is
instant
identification
in
a
law
enforcement
situation.
and
how
is
that
interest
served
equally
well
without
the
photograph?
justice
stevens
that
then
turns
on
the
number
of
people
accepted.
is
that
right?
the
fact
that
there
is
only
one
exception,
why,
you
would
always
be
able
to
be
entitled
to
it,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
test
under
your
argument.
maybe
i
don't
follow
it
completely.
if
you
are
acknowledging
that
there
isn't
a
substitute
way
of
achieving
the
state
purpose
of
instant
identification
or
prompt
identification,
what
you
have
to
say
is,
well,
it
really
isn't
all
that
important
if
we
only
exempt
a
handful
of
people.
and
therefore
it
turns
entirely,
i
think,
on
the
number
of
people
who
are
exempted,
which
would
differentiate
this
case,
i
suppose,
from
the
numbers
case.
or
maybe
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
have
this
particular
faith.
i
don't
really
know.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
well,
i
know
the
court
hasn't
said
it,
but
i
think
that
is
what
you
are
saying.
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
ask
you
about.
i
am
trying
to
really
be
sure
i
understand
precisely
what
your
position
is.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
another
thing
is,
she
is
a
law-abiding
citizen,
you
say,
so
it
is
not
very
important.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
the
exemption
for
the
amish
in
the
lee
case
would
have
been
more
or
less
burdensome
than
the
exemption
here?
there
were
more
amish
than
there
were
here.
justice
stevens
well,
actually,
there
they
contributed
their
own
social
security
system,
so...
i
had
some
difficulty
understanding
how
that
was
really
all
that
burdensome
in
that
case.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
again,
does
your
case,
do
you
think,
depend
on
there
being
all
these
other
problems
around
the
corner,
numbers
and
signatures
and
so
forth?
supposing
we
somehow
knew,
which
of
course
we
don't,
that
there
are
no
other
religious
claims
going
to
be
made
other
than
the
claim
to
be
exempt
from
the
photographic
problem,
and
we
could
figure
out
some
way
to
say
those
cases
are
all
different,
maybe
because
there
are
a
lot
more
people
or
something?
would
you
still
make
the
same
argument,
just
concentrating
on
photo?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
couldn't
you
solve
that
by
saying
no
exemption
shall
be
granted
except
by
the
governor
or
somebody,
you
know,
have
a
special...
one
person
to
grant
the
exemption?
i
don't
know
if...
aren't
they
rare
enough
that
you
are
not
going
to
have
these
things
every
day?
justice
stevens
well,
say
no
exemption
until
you
fill
out
the
following
97
forms
and
take
a
visit
through
your
house
to
show
you
have
got
no
pictures
at
home,
and
about
19
different
things
you
have
to
do
to
get
the
exemption,
and
until
you
fulfill
all
those
requirements
you
don't
get
the
license.
couldn't
you
put
the
burden
on
the
applicant?
justice
stevens
what
if
you
required
them
to
bring
in
their
high
school
yearbook
and
show
that
their
picture
wasn't
in
it?
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
this
one
is
singularly
easy
to
prove.
maybe
i
am
wrong.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
unlike
a
lot
of
others,
because
i
can't
imagine
there
being
too
many
people
that
you
can't
tell
whether
they
have
sometimes
consented
to
have
a
photograph
taken
of
themselves.
