you
would
require
an
opt-in
procedure
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
you
are
right,
i
am
concerned
about
the
standing
of
your
client
to
raise
that
question
for
one
of
the
28,000
some
odd
people
who
apparently
have
not
come
forward
to
object.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
klein,
did
the
respondents
challenge
petitioners'
standing
to
raise
this
question
over
non-resident
plaintiffs
in
the
kansas
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
the
kansas
courts
nevertheless
reach
and
resolve
the
jurisdiction
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that
sufficient,
then,
for
us
to
exercise
discretion
to
reach
it
under
craig
versus
boren?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
this
court
doesn't
even
have
discretion
to
reach
the
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
mr.
klein,
is
it
a
matter
of
article
iii
standing
or
prudential
standing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
would
seem
here
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii
standing
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy,
and
you
have
someone
who
is
well
able
to
litigate
the
issue,
and
that
it
is
more
a
matter
of
prudential
standing
if
there
is
a
problem
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how
about
if
there
were
an
opt-in
procedure
required
as
a
matter
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
understand
that,
but
if
they
did,
and
if
it
were
resolved
that
opt-in
was
required,
i
suppose
then
you
end
up
with
a
res
judicata
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
the
opt-out
person,
member
of
the
class
who
in
fact
never
got
the
notice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
the
respondents
make
the
argument
that
the
applicable
law
in
some
of
the
states
in
which
the
leases
were
made
would
result
in
a
different
amount
of
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
don't
know
but
what
that
might
be
true
for
purposes
of
our
decision,
right?
