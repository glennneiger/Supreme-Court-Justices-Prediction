mr.
arthur
r.
miller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
two
issues
in
this
case
are,
first,
whether
the
state
of
kansas,
consistent
with
the
notions
of
individual
liberty
and
interstate
federalism
imbedded
in
the
due
process
clause
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
may
assert
jurisdiction
and
enter
a
binding
judgment
affecting
thousands
of
non-residents
of
kansas
who
have
had
no
contacts
with
kansas
and
whose
oil
and
gas
royalty
interest
claims
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
kansas
and
when
there
is
no
legitimate
public
policy
of
kansas
implicated
in
the
action,
and
second,
whether
kansas
can
indiscriminately
apply
kansas
law
to
each
and
every
one
of
these
claims.
the
petitioner
asserts
that
the
answer
to
both
of
these
questions
is
in
the
negative.
in
an
unbroken
line
of
cases
starting
with
international
shoe
and
moving
through
hanson
and
denckla,
and
most
recently
further
articulated
in
the
woodson
case,
for
40
years
this
court
has
established
a
constitutional
requirement
that
minimum
contacts
must
exist
between
a
party
and
a
state
before
that
state
can
assert
jurisdiction
over
that
party,
that
there
must
be
a
relationship
among
the
defendant,
the
forum,
and
the
litigation,
to
use
language
from
those
cases.
as
fully
articulated
in
justice
white's
opinion
in
the
woodson
case,
that
minimum
contact
standard
serves
as
a
principal,
realistic,
and
flexible
instrument
protecting
two
values.
first
is
the
liberty
interest
of
the
individual
not
to
be
subjected
to
litigation
in
a
forum
with
which
he
or
she
has
not
voluntarily
affiliated.
the
second
objective
of
the
minimum
contacts
test
is
to
limit
the
authority
of
each
state
within
the
context
of
the
federal
system.
that
means
that
i
as
a
citizen
of
massachusetts,
and
mr.
kubbich
of
phillips
petroleum
as
a
citizen
of
oklahoma,
has
an
individual
liberty
interest
not
to
be
burdened,
not
to
be
affected,
not
to
have
his
property
rights
or
personal
rights
affected
by
a
state
that
he
has
not
affiliated
with.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
our
position,
justice
white,
is
that
although
those
cases
which
i
have
described
do
speak
in
terms
of
the
defendant,
because
the
party
to
be
affected
in
those
cases
were
defendants,
that
that
same
principle
must
be
applied
to
non-resident
class
members.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
absolutely
not.
this
court
has
said
several
times
that
a
cause
of
action
is
a
property
right.
it
has
said
that
in
the
zimmerman
case.
it
has
said
it
in
effect
in
the
mullane
case.
it
has
said
it
in
boddie.
it
has
said
it
in
rogers.
in
a
sense
it
has
said
it
in
the
dunleavy
case
many,
many
years
ago,
that
there
really
is
no
difference
between
my
being
held
liable
for
$10
and
my
claim
of
$10
being
foreclosed
by
the
judicial
action
of
the
state
of
kansas,
that
i
have
an
individual
liberty
interest
unless
i
have
affiliated
with
kansas.
i
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
my
property,
my
claims,
my
liabilities
adjudicated
by
the
sovereignty
of
my
state--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--well,
those
members
of
the
plaintiff's
class
who
have
voluntarily
affiliated
by
some
affirmative
act.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
like
the
named
plaintiffs
or
anyone
from
any
state
who
would
wish
to
join
the
named
plaintiffs
in
that
action.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
we
would
require,
and
i
believe
the
constitution
requires
that
there
be
an
affirmative
act
taken
by
the
non-resident
to
show
a
willingness
to
subject
himself
to
the
forum.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
we
base
our
standing
on
cases
going
back
to
hansen
and
denckla
in
which
a
defendant
from
florida
was
permitted
by
this
court
to
assert
on
behalf
of
an
absent
trustee
the
non-jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
florida
over
that
delaware
trustee.
in
that
situation,
this
court
said
that
those
floridians
had
a
direct,
substantial
personal
interest
in
the
outcome
of
that
jurisdictional
question,
in
part,
of
course,
because
the
delaware
trustee
was
declared
by
florida
law
to
be
indispensable.
we
believe
that
the
non-resident,
non-volitional
plaintiff
class
members
are
also
indispensable
parties
to
their
own
claims,
just
as
that
delaware
trust
was
indispensable
in
the
hansen
case.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
well,
our
standing,
i
believe,
is
predicated
on
our
own
personal
interest
in
this
case.
we
have
been
subjected
in
kansas
to
a
lawsuit
and
the
judgment
now
in
favor
of
28,100
plaintiffs.
there
are
only
somewhere
between
500
and
1,000
kansas
or
kansas
leased
plaintiffs
that
would
satisfy
any
of
the
due
process
standards.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
if
you
believe
that
each
of
the
non-resident
class
members
has
a
constitutional
right
to
make
up
his
own
mind
as
to
whether
his
piece
of
property
is
to
be
put
on
the
litigation
chessboard,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
if,
to
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
reference
to
the
opt-in
class,
if
kansas
wishes
to
expand
its
class
action
power,
then
its
invitation
to
non-residents,
its
invitation
to
those
with
whom
it
has
no
constitutional
affiliation,
must
come
at
a
moment
in
time
that
is
meaningful.
if
one
looks
at
the
class
action
statute
of
kansas,
which
is
virtually
but
not
completely
identical
to
federal
rule
23,
you
discover
that
the
notice
provided
for
and
the
opt-out
right
and
the
representation
provided
for
by
the
kansas
class
action
statute
comes
after
certification,
which
we
submit
is
not
a
rational
time
at
which
the
non-resident
class
member
can
exercise
his
right
to
participate
or
not
participate.
this
case
is
a
classic
illustration
of
that,
because
three
years
went
by
between
the
institution
of
the
action
and
the
notice
to
the
absent
class
members.
justice
o'connor
asked
about
our
standing.
well,
we
were
the
only
game
in
town.
you
cannot
expect
the
class
representative
to
assert
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
28,000
of
his
troops.
that
is
unrealistic.
you
cannot
expect
the
non-resident
class
members
to
assert
the
jurisdiction
issue
between
institution
and
notice.
they
have
no
notice
of
the
case.
we
were
obliged
under
the
normal
rules
of
assertion
of
threshold
defenses
to
make
the
jurisdictional
objection
prior
to
answer
and
litigate
it,
as
we
did,
in
a
fully
adversarial
context.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
about
the
completeness
of
this
issue
or
the
zealotry
with
which
we
have
pursued
this
issue.
we
were
forced
to
assert
it
when
there
literally
was
no
one
else
who
would
assert
it.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
if
one
views
life
with
20/20
hindsight,
justice
rehnquist,
if
you
ask
me
or
any
rational
person,
would
you
prefer
to
have
a
check
for
$10
or
not
to
have
a
check
for
$10,
i
assume
i
would
take
the
$10
every
time.
but
you
cannot
construct
a
principle
about
state
court
jurisdiction
and
the
legitimacy
of
kansas
powers
with
the
assumption
that
the
class
will
always
win.
if
the
class
losses,
then
you
have
the
potential
that
the
party
in
the
phillips
position
then
prevents
action
to
by
another
member
of
the
class,
a
non-resident,
and
seeks
to
bind
that
person
by
virtue
of
res
judicata.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
the
record--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
record
is
clear
that
there
are
eleven
gas
states
involved,
and
that
there
are
class
members
from
each
and
every
state
in
the
union.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
every
state
in
the
union
is
represented
by
a
royalty
owner,
as
well
as
some
foreign
countries.
now,
one
thing
should
be,
i
think,
very
clear.
phillips
is
not
arguing
that
there
cannot
be
a
national
class
action
in
a
state
court.
there
typically
is
at
least
one
jurisdiction
with
the
necessary
shoe,
denckla,
woodson
contacts
to
provide
a
forum.
to
be
sure,
the
restriction
of
the
forum
to
a
state
that
would
have
the
requisite
minimum
contacts
with
each
and
every
member
of
the
class
might
reduce
the
forum
shopping
capacity
of
the
plaintiff's
attorney,
but,
for
example,
in
this
context
we
believe
that
quite
possibly
oklahoma
is
such
a
forum.
second--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--justice
stevens,
i
think
that
is
right.
if
you
have
a
member
of
the
class
who
is
unaffiliated
in
the
due
process
sense,
that
individual
cannot
be
bound
by
the
forum
state
absent
his
or
her
voluntary
participation
by
using
an
appropriately
crafted--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--you
may
not
have
a
class
that
will
include
unaffiliated
class
members.
i
do
not--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--persons
who
have
not
manifested
consent.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
persons
who
do
not
have
voluntary
affiliation.
persons
who
do
not--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--you
either
would
have
to
opt-in
or
be
a
resident
or
by
some
circumstance
of
fact
have
voluntarily
affiliated
by
the
nature
of
your
transaction.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no.
understand
that--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--it
would
be
enough
for
a
resident.
it
would
be
enough
for
a
consenting
plaintiff.
it
would
be
enough,
for
example,
if
the
non-resident
class
member
had
a
lease,
let's
say,
a
gas
lease
in
that
state.
irl
shutts
is
a
perfect
illustration.
he
is
a
kansan,
but
his
gas
royalty
interests
are
in
texas
and
oklahoma.
texas
and
oklahoma
could
assert
jurisdiction
over
him
because
he
has
voluntarily
affiliated
in
the
due
process
sense
with
that
state.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
phillips
has
its
main
office
there,
first
of
all.
second--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--conceivably,
and
perhaps
your
own
opinion
in
the
woodson
case
suggests
perhaps
not.
the
flow
of
transactions
between
phillips
and
the
oil
royalty
owners,
over
the
years
the
payments
of
royalties,
the
locus
of
the
lease
transactions,
many
of
which
would
be
in
oklahoma.
but
even
in
a
situation
in
which
there
were
no
such
single
forum,
the
fact
remains
that
at
most,
you
might
have
state-based
class
actions
in
a
few
states,
depending
on
what
their
circumference
of
jurisdictional
reach
would
be.
it
is
quite
possible,
and
again,
i
think
the
choice
of
law
issue
has
tremendous
bearing
on
this--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
would
hope
so,
your
honor.
it
is
quite
possible
that
you
wouldn't
have
precisely
the
same
efficiency
of
a
single
nationally
based
class.
you
might
have
to
have
two,
three,
four
regionally
based
classes,
but
certainly
efficiency
cannot
be
the
be-all
and
end-all
of
this.
it
would
be
efficient,
for
example,
if
a
court
like
kansas,
which
has
a
party
rule
structure
just
like
the
federal
rules,
it
would
be
efficient
to
be
able
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
third
party
defendant,
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
third
party
to
a
counterclaim
or
a
cross-claim,
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
necessary
or
indispensable
party,
a
rule
19
party.
i
don't
think
anyone
would
ever
argue
that
there
is
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
these
non-parties
just
because
the
party
structure
of
the
federal
rules
or
the
rules
of
kansas
permitted
a
procedural
device
to
be
used
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
action.
so,
i
am
mystified
as
to
why
through
the
simple
device
of
saying
this
is
a
class
action
that
suddenly
the
state
of
kansas
has
broader
geographic,
broader
due
process
reach
than
the
state
of
kansas
would
have
over
a
necessary
or
indispensable
party,
over
a
third
party
claim,
or
over
an
additional
party
to
a
compulsory
counterclaim
or
to
a
cross-claim.
no
one
has
ever
advanced
that
proposition
in
the
name
of
efficiency
and
economy.
the
problem
is
that
the
modern
class
action,
based
solely
on
common
questions...
that
is
all
we
have
in
this
case;
this
isn't
a
joint
interest,
it
is
not
a
common
interest,
it
is
at
best
a
common
question
class
action...
seems
to
be
operating
in
a
way
that
sweeps
aside
individual
liberty
interests,
sovereignty
problems
of
interstate
federalism,
and
to
turn
to
the
choice
of
law
issue,
the
question
of
governing
law.
on
that
issue,
it
seems
to
me
one
need
only
read
allstate
insurance
company
versus
hague.
this
case
seems
to
me
to
violate
totally
the
plurality
opinion
in
that
case.
what
is
required
is
a
significant
contact,
requirement
number
one,
creating
state
interests,
requirement
number
two,
so
that
it
is
neither
arbitrary
nor
fundamentally
unfair
to
apply
forum
law,
requirement
number
three.
petitioner
submits
that
the
application
of
kansas
law
across
the
board
in
this
class
action
violates
each
and
every
one
of
those
three
requirements.
there
is
no
contact.
the
only
contact
this
case
has
when
viewed
through
the
eyes
of
the
non-resident
class
members
is
the
fact
that
phillips
does
business
in
kansas.
but
when
you
look
at
a
transaction
between
phillips,
the
oklahoma
company,
and
an
oklahoma
royalty
owner
involving
gas
in
the
ground
in
oklahoma--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--justice
stevens,
that
is
this
case.
betty...
the
andersons,
they
are
oklahomans.
they
are
oklahomans
with
gas
interests
in
oklahoma.
they
have
traveled
to
kansas
to
sue
phillips.
we
submit--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--the
closest
case
would
be
the
yates
case
and
the
dick
case,
admittedly
older
cases.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no,
i
would
submit
that
if
you
simply
apply
the
tripartite
standard
that
this
court
recently
announced
in
the
hague
case,
that
is
a
legitimate
and
reasonable
limitation
on
state
court
choice
of
law.
you
need
go
no
further.
with
great
deference,
justice
stevens,
i
think
if
we
applied
the
test
espoused
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
that
case,
one
would
be
hard
pressed
to
see
what
conceivable
interest
the
state
of
kansas
has
in
applying
its
law
to
a
transaction
about
oklahoma
gas
between
oklahomans
and
a
company
whose
principal
base
is
in
oklahoma.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
there
are
several,
your
honor.
first,
when
you
look
at
the
structure
of
shutts
ii,
and
it
is
very
important
to
understand
that
shutts
ii
and
shutts
i
are
two
entirely
different
cases,
they
are
not
the
same
case
in
a
later
manifestation,
you
see
that
what
the
state
of
kansas
did
without
citing
hague
is
literally
say,
we
have
jurisdiction
here,
and
absent
compelling
reasons,
we
are
going
to
apply
kansas
law
across
the
board.
and
then,
in
what
might
be
called
all
fruits
are
apples
approach,
the
state
of
kansas
said
all
of
these
contracts
are
the
same.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
all
the
contracts
are
not
the
same.
some
of
the
contracts
that
phillips
has,
particularly
with
producers
as
opposed
to
royalty
owners,
are
no
interest
contracts
that
do
not
call
for
payment
until
the
end
of
the
suspense
royalty
period,
and
explicitly
say
no
interest.
we
know
from
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
a
post-shutts
i,
pre-shutts
ii
opinion
that
the
state
of
texas
would
enforce
that
contract.
the
state
of
kansas
chose
to
ignore
that
in
favor
of
kansas's
perception
of
what
is
fair.
second,
the
official
statutory
interest
rates
in
the
other
states,
particularly
texas,
the
most
dominant
state,
oklahoma,
louisiana,
new
mexico,
wyoming,
range
between
6
and
7
percent.
the
state
of
kansas
chose
to
use
what
is
called
the
ferc
rate.
that
is
a
rate
that
applies
between
the
interstate
pipeline
companies
and
a
producer
like
phillips.
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
royalty
owners.
absolutely
nothing.
kansas
said
its
notions
of
fairness,
favoring
the
royalty
owners,
caused
the
application
of
the
ferc
rate
under
kansas
law
which
averages
11
to
13
percent,
whereas
we
know
from
the
stahl
case
that
the
state
of
texas
would
have
applied
its
statutory
6
percent
rate.
in
short,
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
any
inquiry
as
to
what
the
other
state
laws
were.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
would
not
go
that
far,
justice
white.
i
think
they
view
it
as
a
sort
of
a
brooding
omnipresence,
an
influence,
and
the
fault
with
that
is
that
the
relationship
between
royalty
owners
and
gas
producers
is
state-based,
whereas
the
so-called
ferc
rate
regulates
the
relationship
between
the
gas
sellers
and
the
interstate
pipelines.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no,
absolutely
none.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
problem
here
of--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--preemption
or
federal
common
law
or
anything
of
that
kind.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
we
have
tried
to
indicate,
justice
stevens,
in
our
reply
brief
that
we
are
not
talking
about
harmless
error
here.
at
the
moment,
the
interest
liability
imposed
on
phillips
is
approximately
$6.5
million.
we
estimate
that
the
application
of
the
applicable
statutory
interest
rates
of
the
other
states
and
the
recognition
as
texas
would
recognize
the
no-interest
contracts
would
reduce
that
$6.5
million
liability
to
something
under
$2
million,
perhaps
as
low
as
$1
million.
so,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
phillips
feels
aggrieved
by
the
indiscriminate
application
of
kansas
law
to
transactions
that
are
not
transitory
the
way
the
national
risk
coverage
in
allstate
was.
this
is
gas
in
the
ground.
this
is
a
contract
about
gas
in
the
ground,
being
oklahoma,
or
in
texas.
it
is
not
a
national
risk.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
believe
on
the
standing
question
that
the
article
iii
requirement
is
clearly
satisfied
by
the
impact
of
this
kansas
judgment
on
phillips.
the
question
of
so-called
third
party
standing,
which
has
been
raised
by
several
of
the
justices,
is
a
prudential
doctrine,
pure
and
simple,
be
applied
to
assure
the
necessary
adversarial
and
concreteness
in
the
case.
in
craig
versus
boren,
justice
brennan,
writing
for
the
court,
said
that
these
prudential
objectives
cannot
be
furthered
here
where
the
lower
court
already
has
entertained
a
relevant
constitutional
challenge.
in
such
circumstances,
a
decision
by
us
to
forego
consideration
of
the
constitutional
challenge
to
the
statute
by
injured
third
parties
would
be
impermissibly
to
foster
repetitive
and
time
consuming
litigation
under
the
guise
of
caution
and
prudence.
as
this
court
well
knows,
this
issue
was
up
here
two
and
one
half
years
ago
in
miner
versus
gillette.
at
that
time,
the
party
in
the
position
of
phillips
was
told,
you
have
no
final
judgment.
now
to
be
told
that
you
have
no
standing,
and
to
wait
for
the
hypothetical
collateral
attack
to
occur
while
the
states
are
reaching
inconsistent
results
on
this
issue...
keep
in
mind
that
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
take
a
different
view,
take
the
view
that
phillips
is
asserting
here...
leads
to
destabilization
in
the
national
class
action
context
at
the
very
moment
in
time
when
this
phenomenon
is
mushrooming.
so,
we
believe
that
there
clearly
is
standing
from
a
prudential
point
of
view.
second,
let
me
remind
the
court
that
it
has
said
that
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
is
analytically
prerequisite
to
the
issues
of
procedure.
that
statement,
analytically
prerequisite,
is
from
rush
versus
savchuk,
where
you
had
a
nominal
defendant.
this
court
in
baldwin
years
ago,
most
recently
in
bank
of
ireland,
said
that
an
individual
is
free
to
ignore
proceedings.
the
right
to
ignore
proceedings
is
taken
away
by
saying
that
kansas
can
assert
jurisdiction
over
non-resident,
non-volitional
class
members.
in
the
churry
case
years
ago,
and
again
in
bank
of
ireland
just
a
couple
of
years
ago,
this
court
said
that
a
state
cannot
conclude
interested
parties
by
the
mere
assertion
of
its
own
power.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
a
rule
23
diversity-based
class
action
as
it
is
currently
constituted,
i
believe
that
you
have
the
same
fourteenth
amendment
problems
that
we
are
asserting
here.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
what
respondent
is
saying
is
that
kansas
wants
to
help
the
small
claimant.
god
bless
kansas
for
doing
it.
but
there
are
many
ways
kansas
can
do
it
without
shoving
aside
the
individual
liberty
interests,
the
interstate
federal
interests,
let
alone
the
choice
of
law
sovereignty
interest.
kansas
could
create
a
legitimate
opt-in
and
invite
people
to
come
in.
kansas
could
sweeten
the
class
action
pot
by
awarding
as
a
statutory
matter
treble
damages.
it
could
provide
punitive
damages
to
encourage
it.
if
kansas
is
really
interested
in
the
small
claimant,
it
could
create
a
patens
patriae
action.
that
is
for
kansas
to
do,
not
for
this
court
to
do.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
image
in
this
field
is
known
as
the
magnet
jurisdiction.
here
kansas
is
dictating
oil
and
gas
policy
to
the
nation
in
the
guise
of
what
it
believes
is
fair.
