unknown
speaker
so
a
plaintiff
class
has...
the
constitution
requires
the
plaintiff's
class
to
be
limited
to
those
who
have
some
realistic
connection
with
the
forum
state?
unknown
speaker
right,
like
the
named
plaintiffs.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
these
non-residents
are
proper
parties,
you
may
have
to
pay
them.
that
sounds
like
a
piece
of
standing,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
even
now
if
all
the
parties
were
notified
that
the
phillips
attorney
is
making
an
argument
that
you
people
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
share,
but
please
write
us
a
letter
now
and
we
will
give
you
some
money,
i
suppose
even
at
this
late
date
thee
could
be
some
opt-ins,
couldn't
there?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
suggest
that
oklahoma
might
be
able
to...
a
forum
for
this
entire
class?
because
that
is
the...
just
because
phillips
has
its
main
office
there?
unknown
speaker
why
would
that
affect
the
connections
of
the
plaintiffs
with
the--
unknown
speaker
--you
are
going
to
argue
that,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
there
were
no
arguments
in
the
courts
below
in
any
of
these
cases
that
federal
law
should
govern?
unknown
speaker
preemption.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
even
though
the
defendant
prevailed
on
the
merits
in
this
case,
the
defendant
either
before
or
after
judgment
can
never
raise
the
rights
of
an
absent
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
second
interest?
you
said
there
were
two
reasons.
unknown
speaker
that
is
is
a
particularly
fair
choice.
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
perfectly
clear
that
in
one
of
these
other
states
they
would
have
not
chosen
that
law,
but
they
would
have
chosen
a
rule
that
says
no
interest
at
all,
would
you
still
be
able
to
make
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
royalty...
even
though
the
governing
papers
said
no
interest,
there
will
be
no
interest
in
these
suspended
royalty
payments.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
contract
was
perfectly
clear,
and
i
understand
it
to
be
asserted
here
that
if
this
case
had
been
tried
in
some
other
states,
they
would
have
followed
the
provisions
of
the
contracts.
unknown
speaker
yes,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
so
kansas
would
be
perfectly
free
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
to
say,
well,
we
know
that
that
provision
is
in
the
contract
forbidding
interest,
but
we
just
won't
follow
that
provision
in
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
it
is
contrary
to
our
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
my
question
then?
here
is,
in
this
case,
it
is
shown
to
the
court
that
there
are
some
contracts
with
royalty
owners
that
would
bar
interest,
just
no
interest,
it
just
provides
right
in
the
contract
no
interest.
unknown
speaker
now,
could
kansas
then
apply
its
law
and
say
we
are
going
to
disregard
that?
unknown
speaker
you
must
be
arguing
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
would
make
the
same
interest...
make
the
same
argument
if
it
turned
out
to
be
a
fact
that
here
are
100
royalty
owners
who
reside
in
a
certain
state,
and
their
royalty
contracts
provide
for
a
higher
rate
of
interest
than
the
kansas
court
awarded.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
kansas
apply
its
own
rate
of
interest,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
despite
the
governing
law
for
a
higher
rate
in
another
state?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
argument
would
be
also
directed
against
a
federal
class
action,
rule
23.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
the
risk
of
sort
of
a
reno
syndrome
when
reno,
nevada,
had
all
the
divorces
for
a
while?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
