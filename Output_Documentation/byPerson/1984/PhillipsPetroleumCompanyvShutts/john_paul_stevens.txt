justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
stop
you
right
there
for
a
moment?
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
brief,
because
i
thought
most
of
your
arguments
would
apply
even
if
you
had
90
percent
of
your
class
in
kansas
and
your
10
percent
were
non-residents.
isn't
there
the
same
problem
for
those
10
percent
as
to
the
fairness
to
them
of
being
bound?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
your
first
submission,
then,
putting
aside
the
choice
of...
your
first
submission,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
unless
you
have
an
opt-in
procedure
or
some
equivalent,
you
may
not
have
a
class
that
includes
non-residents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
that
you
mean
persons
who
are
not
residents
of
the
forum
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
sum
up,
you
either
have
to
opt-in
or
be
a
resident
to
be
a
class
member.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
would
not
be
enough
that
you
received
an
adequate
notice
and
you
did
not
respond
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
enough,
if
i
understand
your
submission,
for
a
resident.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
for
just
a
second
on
that
question?
supposing
we
didn't
have
a
class
action
now,
and
are
just
focusing
on
choice
of
law,
and
somebody
in
alaska
sued
your
client,
presumably
got
jurisdiction
in
kansas,
because
you
do
business
there.
would
you
have
the
same
forceful
constitutional
arguments
to
applying
kansas
law
in
that
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
say
the
kansas
supreme
court
makes
an
erroneous
choice
of
law
decision.
clearly
under
all
principles
of
choice
of
law
they
should
have
applied
oklahoma
law
instead
of
kansas.
have
we
ever
reversed
a
state
court
for
making
that
kind
of
an
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
this
give
us
general
review
of
all
choice
of
law
decisions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
also,
because
it
helps
me
focus
on
the
issue,
on
what
particular
issues
of
law
do
you
think
it
was
most
outrageous
for
them
to
do
what
they
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
conceding,
mr.
klein,
that
before
judgment
they
did
have
standing
to
say
it
is
unfair
for
you
to
sue
me
when
i
couldn't
get
a
binding
judgment
against
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
article
iii
standing,
isn't
it...
don't
i
have
the
right
to
argue
it
is
unfair
to
me
for
you
to
be
suing
me
when
i
can't
get
a
binding
judgment
if
i
win?
that
is
basically
their
argument,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
not
get
a
binding
judgment
against
the
absent
plaintiffs
even
if
they
win
on
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
that
you
have
won,
but
in
advance
of
the
decision
on
the
merits,
their
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
it
ought
to
be
a
two-way
street.
if
you
win,
you
will
pay,
but
if
you
lose,
they
ought
to
be
protected
by
res
judicata
against
relitigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
does
your
position
require
this
to
be
a
class
action?
would
you
make
the
same
argument
with
my
individual
from
alaska
who
sued
on
an
oklahoma
lease?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
lease...
it
is
clear
there
would
be
expected
oklahoma
law
to
apply,
and
in
oklahoma
he
wouldn't
have
gotten
any
interest
at
all?
i
don't
know
if
that
is
true
of
oklahoma.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
an
argument
that
in
one
state
you
wouldn't
have
gotten
any
interest.
texas,
i
guess
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
that
a
party
like
phillips,
unless
it
puts
it
in
the
agreement,
it
cannot
rely
on
the
normal
rule
of
the
place
where
the
contract
is
made
that
this
will
be
governed
by,
say,
everybody
expects
that
rule
to
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
they
have
ever
anticipated
in
my
alaska-oklahoma
example
that
kansas
law
would
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
reason
for
kansas
to
apply
its
law,
or
do
you
say
there
doesn't
even
have
to
be
a
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is...
any
time
you
get
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
in
a
state,
it
is
all
right
for
that
state
to
apply
its
own
law?
