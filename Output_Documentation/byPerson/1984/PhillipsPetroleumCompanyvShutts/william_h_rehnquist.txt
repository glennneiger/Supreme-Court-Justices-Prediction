as
a
matter
of
practicality,
we
really
don't
have
much
reason
to
think
that
these
28,000
people
who
have
been
kind
of
handed
a
percentage
of
a
recovery
on
a
silver
platter
are
going
to
have
much
squawk
about
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
miller's
argument
is
that
that
isn't
always
going
to
happen,
and
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
prevails,
there
may
be
some
problems
with
the
absent
plaintiff.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
do
you
decide
this
sort
of
an
issue
when
the
time
comes
for
a
motion
to
certify
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
in
the
state
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
certainly
their
argument.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
happen
to
agree
with
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
takes
two
lawsuits
to
litigate,
doesn't
it?
you
are
saying
the
defendant
can
lose
its
rights
in
just
one
lawsuit,
but
it
has
to
prevail
in
two
lawsuits
in
order
to
establish
res
judicata.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
let's
ones
who
don't
intervene
and
simply--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
won't
protect
people.
it
will
certainly
protect
them
from
having
jurisdiction
exercised
over
their
claim
contrary
to
their
wishes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
it
about
the
opt-in
provision
that
you
say
doesn't
protect--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
how
does
it
protect
them
to
include
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
they
could
lose
several
things,
i
suppose.
you
know,
they
might
have
a
claim
adjudicated
in
a
jurisdiction
they
didn't
want
to.
they
might
have
it
adjudicated
by
a
poor
lawyer,
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
typical
size
of
the
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
hundred
dollars?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
see
how
an
opt-out
rule
gets
you
a
lot
more
plaintiffs.
i
can't
see
how
it
necessarily
"protects"
the
absent
plaintiffs
the
way
you
are
talking
about.
