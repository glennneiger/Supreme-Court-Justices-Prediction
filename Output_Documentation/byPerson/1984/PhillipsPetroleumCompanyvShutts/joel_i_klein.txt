mr.
joel
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
standing
issue
in
this
case
is
not
merely
whether
phillips
may
raise
the
constitutional
rights
of
others,
but
whether
phillips
may
raise
the
rights
of
absent
class
members
to
defeat
a
recovery
in
their
favor
that
was
obtained
against
phillips.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
we
challenged
that
in
the
kansas
courts.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
kansas
courts
did
reach
and
resolve
the
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
state
court
determinations
of
standing
do
not
confer
a
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
it
made
clear
in
tileston,
and
of
course
the
term
before
last
in
massachusetts
general
hospital
and
the
city
of
revere
case
the
court
said
that
state
courts
are
not
bound
by
the
limitations
on
standing
that
this
court
is
bound
by.
and
of
course
this
court
always
assesses
its
jurisdiction,
and
this
standing
doctrine
is
a
part
of
its
jurisdiction
independently,
and
that
is,
no
matter
what
the
state
court
does,
it
applies
federal
principles
here.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
do
not
think...
on
established
case
law
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
reason
is
that
no
case
has
ever
gone
in
this
direction.
let
me
make
something
clear.
it
is
somewhat
confused
by
the
argument
we
have
just
heard.
there
is
only
one
constitutional
right
at
issue
here.
that
is
the
right
of
the
action
class
member
to
object
to
jurisdiction
in
kansas.
now,
when
a
case
comes
to
this
court,
that
class
member
has
received
a
complete
recovery
against
phillips,
and
here
is
what
phillips
is
saying
to
him.
we
are
going
to
take
your
right,
we
are
going
to
take
it
to
the
supreme
court,
we
are
going
to
protect
your
right,
and
the
result
of
it
is,
we
take
away
your
recovery.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
there
may
be,
your
honor,
and
in
that
case
i
assume
we
may
hear
from
them.
they
will
press
their
own
rights
then.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
in
the
state
court,
in
kansas
as
in
the
federal
court,
all
parties
have
a
right
to
raise
the
issue.
but
it
is
entirely
different
after
judgment,
and
that
is
true,
justice
rehnquist,
with
respect
to
a
defendant.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
a
defendant
comes
into
court.
he
makes
a
special
appearance
and
contests
jurisdiction.
the
court
rules
he
has
jurisdiction.
they
proceed
to
the
merits.
the
defendant
wins
on
the
merits.
the
plaintiff
can't
appeal
and
say
we
wouldn't
have
had
jurisdiction.
once
there
is
a
judgment,
the
equation
changes.
now,
phillips
says
in
this
court,
it
says
we
have
suffered
injury.
that
satisfies
the
case
in
controversy
requirement.
but
this
court
has
made
clear
time
and
again
injury
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
invoke
jurisdiction.
everybody
up
here
seeking
a
reverse
of
judgment
has
suffered
injury.
that
is
by
definition
the
case.
in
order
to
reverse
the
judgment,
you
have
to
invoke
your
rights,
or
in
limited
circumstances
the
rights
of
an
allied
party,
such
as
when
the
court
has
said
a
doctor
can
use
a
patient's
rights,
but
never,
in
no
case,
and
phillips
cites
none,
has
the
court
suggested
that
a
party
could
raise
his
adversary's
rights.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
defendant
can
raise
them
at
the
outset
of
litigation.
that
is
what
kansas
law
allows
them,
your
honor,
and
i
think
if
you
read
the
federal
rules,
the
federal
courts
allow
that.
but
it
is
an
entirely
different
matter,
it
must
be,
once
the
person
has
a
judgment,
to
say
you
are
going
to
raise
his
rights.
anybody
can
raise
a
right
and
then
waive
it
later.
that
is
the
nature
of
the
right,
and
that
is
effectively
what
is
going
on
here.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
am
conceding
that
under
kansas
law,
that
is--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--not
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
their
argument
is
that--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--but
they
have
no
constitutional
right.
they
will
get
a
binding
judgment
in
this
case.
their
right
is
protected,
justice
stevens.
as
soon
as
each
class
member
receives
his
judgment,
they
will
have
a
binding--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no,
but
that...
it
is
not
a
two-way
street
once
we
have
won,
your
honor,
because
they
are
taking
my
rights.
that
is
the
basic
parklane
versus
shore.
the
two-way
street
argument
is
basically
a
mutuality
argument.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
their
argument
is
wrong.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
think
the
court
has
confused
those
concepts,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
a
matter
that
is,
in
some
cases
the
court
refers
to
the
right
to
invoke
others'
rights
as
article
iii
standing,
such
as
in
warth,
and
in
other
cases
they
refer
to
it
as
prudential
standing.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but,
justice
o'connor,
when
you
say
well
able
to
litigate
the
issue,
mind
you,
they
have
a
directly
antagonistic
interest
to
the
rights
of
the
party
they
are
trying
to
protect.
just
in
thinking
about
this,
we
would
not
normally
suppose
that
the
right
person
to
stand
before
the
court
and
protect
the
rights
of
absent
class
members
was
its
adversary.
and
the
reason
we
have
this
doctrine,
the
whole
doctrine
was
created,
which
is
a
jurisdictional
limitation,
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
on
the
court's
activity,
the
reasons
we
have
it
are
two.
one,
because
the
party
is
usually
the
best
proponent.
in
this
case,
we
can
assume
that
phillips
is
the
worst
proponent.
they
have
an
antagonistic
interest.
and
second,
and
the
court
says
this
opinion
after
opinion,
a
party
may
in
fact,
who
enjoys
the
rights,
a
party
may
want
to
waive
those
rights.
he
is
entirely
free,
and
he
doesn't
have
to
either
waive
them
at
the
outset
or
never
again.
now,
when
a
party
comes
to
this
court
with
a
judgment
in
its
favor,
can
we
simply
assume,
i
submit,
that
that
party
would
waive
the
rights?
they
are
his
rights.
they
are
not
phillips'
rights.
he
says,
no,
i
have
no
interest
in
pursuing
it.
now,
there
will
be
a
case,
there
will
be
a
case
before
this
court
where
an
absent
class
member
will
assert
his
own
rights.
that
has
happened
in
more
than
half
a
dozen
cases.
when
you
have
that
case,
you
have
a
real
case.
you
have
the
party
saying
my
rights
were
violated.
the
judgment
should
not
bar
me.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
a
defendant
protecting
his
judgment,
saying,
no,
your
rights
weren't
violated,
you
should
be
included.
that's
the
way
this
issue
should
be
framed.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
not
necessarily.
in
many
cases
class
members
will
intervene
if
they--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--your
honor,
ever
case
makes
clear
when
you
have
a
situation
of
an
absent
party
it
will
always
take
two
lawsuits
to
resolve
the
issue
of
res
judicata.
let
me
suggest
even
if
this
court
today
rules
for
phillips,
that
will
not
be
res
judicata
for
the
absent
class
member.
it
will
be
stare
decisis.
but
the
absent
class
member
cannot
be
precluded
in
the
first
litigation.
that
is
clear
in
this
court's
cases.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
that
is
simply
the
question
of
the
merits,
whether
opt-in
would
bind
him
or
not.
what
i
am
saying
is,
they
don't
have
the
standing
to
raise
the
claim.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
but
if
it
is
resolved
as
we
submit,
now
that
we
turn
to
the
merits,
justice
o'connor,
if
it
is
resolved
that
opt-out
is
sufficient,
they
will
be
bound,
and
we
frankly
think
they
are
bound.
we
don't
think
somebody
who
stays
out
of
a
litigation
with
an
opt-out
opportunity
and
then
comes
in
years
later
and
says
i
wasn't
bound
is
going
to
have
a
very
good
claim.
but
let's
turn
to
the
merits,
because
i
think
this
shows--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--in
this
case
that
didn't
occur.
anyone
to
whom
notice
wasn't
delivered,
justice
o'connor,
they
were
struck
from
the
class,
so
it
had
to
be
people
who
received
notice.
but
even
these
questions
show
why
this
case
is
a
bad
vehicle
to
resolve
it.
there
are
questions
about,
what
about
if
you
didn't
get
the
notice?
suppose
he
got
it
late.
how
about
counterclaims?
how
about
court
costs?
all
of
those
matters
are
not
in
this
case.
we
have
to
conjecture
about
them.
none
of
them
were
presented.
if
we
have
a
case
from
a
class
member,
we
will
hear
exactly
what
the
graveman
of
his
complaint
is.
and
it
is
clear
that
this
court
doesn't
decide
cases
on
conjecture,
and
that
is
what
phillips
is
asking
you
do
to,
especially
when
you
have
a
party
who
wants
a
conjecture
in
the
wrong
direction.
so
let
me
turn
to
the
merits,
because
again,
the
rule
here
is
to
protect
the
absent
class
member,
not
to
protect
phillips,
but
i
think
you
look
at
the
rule
that
phillips
espouses,
you
will
see
that
in
the
name
of
the
absent
class
members
phillips
is
shielding
itself
from
litigation.
now,
the
kansas
courts
provided
all
class
members
with
the
following
protections.
first,
adequate
representation
through
the
named
plaintiffs
and
their
counsel.
second,
first
class
mail
notice
that
had
to
be
delivered
describing
the
action.
third,
a
right
to
participate
in
person
or
through
that
person's
counsel.
and
fourth,
a
right
to
opt-out
simply
by
signing
a
form
included
with
the
notice
and
sending
it
to
the
court.
predictably,
phillips
argues
that
that
is
enough.
it
says
there
must
also
be
a
showing
of
minimum
contacts
between
the
non-resident
class
member
in
the
forum.
phillips
reaches
this
conclusion,
we
submit,
by
ignoring
significant
and
almost
obvious
differences
between
plaintiff
class
members
and
defendants,
differences
that
we
believe
justify
a
different
constitutional
due
process
approach
to
protecting
the
rights
of
both
groups.
now,
a
defendant,
of
course,
rarely
wants
to
be
in
court
at
all,
and
certainly
we
know,
we
take
it
as
a
given
that
when
he
is
opposing
jurisdiction,
he
doesn't
want
to
be
in
that
court.
if
he
did,
and
phillips
neglects
this
with
its
interstate
federalism
argument,
and
it
neglects
the
court's
holding
in
insurance
company
versus
ireland,
if
the
defendant
wants
to
be
in
a
court,
he
is
free
to
come
in
at
any
time
irrespective
of
the
federalism
arguments.
now,
starting
from
that
premise...
you
have
to
realize
every
minimum
contacts
case
so
far
has
started
from
the
premise
that
the
party
doesn't
want
to
be
in
court.
when
you
start
from
that
premise,
what
the
court
has
said,
there
are
limits
as
to
which
courts
we
can
require
him
to
litigate
in.
now,
let's
turn
to
a
plaintiff
class
member.
a
plaintiff
class
member
doesn't
face
the
exposure
that
a
defendant
faces.
he
has
not
made
an
objection.
instead,
the
fact
is,
a
class
member
has
a
claim
that
he
wants
asserted.
he
wants
to
have
it
heard.
what
is
the
problem?
the
problem
is,
when
the
small
claimant
has
a
claim,
the
costs
of
litigation
are
so
high
that
he
is
prohibited,
in
effect,
from
asserting
his
claim.
now,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
deposit
guaranty
versus
roper
and
elsewhere,
the
class
action
is
designed
to
overcome
that
hurdle,
to
facilitate
the
plaintiff's
access
to
court.
thus
the
class
action,
in
contrast
to
what
a
defendant
faces
when
he
goes
into
court,
the
plaintiff
faces
no
risk
and
no
cost
unless
he
prevails,
in
which
case
a
portion
of
his
fee
is
paid
for
the
attorneys.
now,
given
that
circumstance,
the
plaintiff's
circumstance,
it
is
impossible,
we
submit,
that
a
minimum
contacts
requirement
could
protect
him.
rather,
what
it
will
do
is
limited
the
potential
forums
that
he
can
have
his
claim
heard
in,
and
he
will
be
in
a
different
position
from
the
other
plaintiffs
in
cases
like
keeton
versus
hustler
who,
because
they
have
large
claims,
can
go
to
their
forums.
now,
in
the
present
case,
for
example,
phillips
says,
and
we
agree,
that
most
of
these
class
members
would
not
meet
the
minimum
contacts
test
in
kansas.
as
a
result,
their
claim
in
the
name
of
protecting
their
rights
would
have
been
barred
from
this
case.
now,
it
may
be
that
there
would
have
been
other
cases
filed.
it
may
be
we
can
speculate
that
because
phillips
is
in
oklahoma,
sort
of,
that
would
be
okay.
all
of
that
is
speculation.
the
fact
is
that
the
large
majority
of
these
people
would
have
been
denied
their
day
in
court.
now,
phillips
says,
and
we
agree,
a
class
member
may
have
an
interest
in
not
involuntarily
being
brought
into
a
particular
class.
the
reason
he
might
have
that
interest
is,
he
might
want
to
assert
a
claim
on
his
own.
or
he
might
want
to
join
another
class
action,
or
for
whatever
reason.
but
kansas
recognizes
that
interest.
it
provides
an
opt-out
procedure
that
is
clear
and
easy.
once
again,
phillips
says
the
opt-out
procedure
is
not
adequate.
it
instead
would
require
an
opt-in
procedure.
unfortunately,
the
large
body
of
scholarly
and
judicial
opinion
that
has
looked
at
the
area
has
decided
almost
unanimously
that
an
opt-out
procedure
better
protects
the
class
members
than
an
opt-in
procedure.
thus,
the
federal
rules
and
virtually
every
state
court's
rules
require
an
opt-out
procedure.
they
do
so
not
to
harm
the
absent
class
member
but
to
help
him.
judge
kaplan,
then
professor
kaplan,
who
is
a
recorder
for
the
rules,
he
explained
the
way
this
came
about.
he
said,
we
have
to
be
especially
concerned
about
the
relatively
small
claimant.
he
said,
this
is
somebody,
if
he
is
not
included
in
the
class,
is
likely
to
have
no
opportunity
to
have
his
claim
heard.
he
said
nevertheless
a
small
claimant
is
often
unsophisticated,
and
as
a
result
of
what
he
called
timidity
or
ignorance
or
unsophistication
about
business
or
legal
matters,
might
decline
to
execute
an
opt-in
forum,
but
that
person
should
be
protected
in
the
class,
and
yet
it
is
that
person
in
the
name
of
protecting
his
rights
that
phillips
would
knock
out
from
this
class
action
altogether.
and
phillips
would
then
suggest
to
the
court,
well,
the
solution
is
that
there
be
a
few
others,
or
maybe
one
other,
or
there
be
one
with
an
opt-in
provision,
but
if
there
is
an
opt-in
provision,
and
professor
kaplan
and
everybody
else
who
has
looked
at
the
matter
is
right,
then
that
opt-in
provision
won't
protect
people,
and
whether
or
not
there
will
be
other
actions
we
have
no
idea.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
an
opt-out
provision
protects
that,
too,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
exact
reason
that
it
was
chosen,
and
that
is,
there
are
some
people,
small
claimants
who
really
as
a
matter
of
unsophistication
may
not
check
the
box,
but
these
are
people
who
every
state's
rules,
virtually
every
state's,
protect
by
including
them
in
the
case.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
because
it
gives
them
a
chance
to
have
their
claim
adjudicated.
they
can
lose
nothing.
they
have
a
claim.
it
gives
them
a
chance
to
be
included
in
the
class.
there
can
be
no
harm
to
them.
they
lose,
it
costs
them
nothing.
but
this
really
gives
them
the
benefit
of
the
process.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
that
is
true,
but,
justice
rehnquist,
it
assumes
that
there
would
be
other
cases
out
there.
these
are
small
claimants.
they
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
bring
their
own
case.
that
is
why
they
choose
opt-out.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
in
this
case?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
a
hundred
dollars.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
a
hundred
dollars.
right.
so
these
are
not
people...
and
it
is
to
protect
their
interests
that
you
have
an
opt-out
rule.
that
is
why
everyone
does
it.
i
mean,
is
it
conceivable--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--it
protects
them
by
facilitating
the
chance
for
them
to
have
their
claim
litigated,
people
who
would
otherwise
not
execute
the
form
and
therefore
never
get
a
chance
to
have
their
claim,
these
people
in
this
case.
they
are
not
going
to
get
their
own
lawyer.
there
were
not
other
class
actions
out
there.
so
it
protects
them
in
that
it
gives
them
a
fair
shot
to
have
their
claim
litigated.
now,
if
i
might
in
the
time
remaining,
i
would
like
to
address
the
choice
of
law
issue
that
has
been
raised
here.
now,
phillips
objects
to
the
choice
of
law
by
the
kansas
supreme
court
on
the
grounds
that
its
application
to
the
claims
of
the
non-resident
class
members
violated
the
principles
set
forth
in
this
court's
decision
in
allstate
versus
hague.
now,
in
allstate,
the
court
made
clear
that
in
deciding
whether
a
state
may
apply
its
law
to
a
dispute,
it
does
not
matter
that
another
state
might
have
an
interest
or
even
a
greater
interest
in
that
dispute.
as
the
court
said,
the
forum
court
is
allowed
to
apply
its
law
when
it
has
a
significant
contact
or
contacts
creating
state
interests
such
that,
and
this
is
the
important
part,
such
that
the
application
of
its
law
is
neither
arbitrary
nor
fundamentally
unfair.
now,
to
clarify
our
position
and
to
state
it
briefly,
kansas's
contact
with
phillips
is
constitutionally
sufficient
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
law
it
chose
to
apply
was
by
no
means
parochial,
but
rather
was
borrowed
directly
from
a
federal
regulatory
program
that
actually
led
to
the
dispute
in
question
in
this
case.
now,
the
plurality
opinion
in
allstate--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--absolutely.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
suggest...
let
me
say
i
think,
your
honor,
it
would
not
make
a
difference.
when
you
say
there
is
an
expectation
that
the
law
would
always
apply,
that
expectation
can
be
put
in
the
agreement.
phillips
never
put
that
expectation
in
the
agreement.
now,
in
allstate
there
was
an
expectation
in
that
sense,
i
think,
as
the
plurality
and
your
honor's
opinion
suggested,
there
was
an
expectation
that
the
matter
would
be
resolved
by
state
law--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
i
think
when
you
say--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
the
question
is
not
whether
they
would
anticipate
it.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
constitution
prohibits
kansas
from
applying
its
law.
i
think
as
the
court
realized
in
allstate,
that
in
an
interstate
situation--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
there
is
a
reason
here.
i
think
there
are
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is,
phillips
does
business,
big
business,
in
kansas.
now,
kansas
confers
the
authority.
it
has
no
right
on
its
own
measure
to
come
in
and
do
business.
the
state
confers
the
authority
for
it
to
do
business.
now,
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
that
when
a
corporation
is
doing
business
within
a
state,
the
state
has
an
interest
not
only
in
the
corporation--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
the
second
interest
has
to
do
with
the
law
that
was
chosen,
justice
stevens.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
it
was
an
especially
fair
choice,
and
not
only
that,
it
was
not
simply
a
fair
choice
in
the
sense
it
was
a
good
rule,
but
it
was
chosen
out
of
the
federal
regulatory
system
that
created
the
problem.
let
me
explain
that
for
a
second.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
sir.
my
argument
would
be
based
on
allstate--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
dispute
that,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
helpful.
i
think
let's
operate
on
that
assumption.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
my
point
is
that
as
long
as
it
doesn't
violate
the
standard
in
allstate,
it
doesn't
have
to
apply
in
other
states'
law,
and
that
is
clear.
now,
allstate
said
that
with
this--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no,
no--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no,
at
that
point
you
get
to
the
question
which
i
think
is
fair,
justice
white,
is,
is
it
parochial,
is
it
arcane?
after
all,
why
are
there
limitations
on
a
choice
of
law?
this
court
hadn't
decided--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--that
would--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--that
wasn't
shown
in
this
case.
if
it
were
shown,
i
think
that
would
raise
an
issue
of
parochialism
that
i
think
might
well
raise
a
choice
of
constitutional
violation,
but
that
was
not
shown
in
this
case,
and
if
there
is
a
question
on
that,
i
think
that
it
is
appropriate
to
look
at
the
texas
law.
but
the
question,
what
is--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--they
do
make
that
argument,
yes.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
for
this
point
it
doesn't
make
a
difference,
but
that
is
clear
from
allstate.
that
is...
there
is
not
one
law
that
has
to
be
chosen.
i
mean,
minnesota
and
wisconsin
had
diametrically
opposed
laws
on
stacking.
a
contract
was
entered
into
in
wisconsin.
the
law
was
applied
in
minnesota.
the
court
found
sufficient
contacts,
and
of
those
contacts,
a
significant
one
was
the
fact
that
the
insurance
company
was
doing
business
in
both
states.
now,
this
court
said
as
long
ago
as
1908
that
a
state
could
prevent
a
corporation
from
practicing,
from
doing
business
within
its
jurisdiction
if
it
committed
an
antitrust
violation
in
another
jurisdiction
that
had
no
impact
in
the
home
jurisdiction,
so
a
state
does
have
an
interest,
a
recognized
interest
in
preventing
or
in
regulating
a
corporation's
dealings
with
other
states.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
assume
the
same
argument
would
be
made,
and
if
phillips
prevailed
on
that,
i
assume
that
would
withstand
choice
of
law.
but
let
me
also
go
to
the
specifics.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
it
could.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
if
there
were
a
clear
contractual
obligation,
then
i
think
you
do
raise
the
arbitrary
and
fundamentally
unfair.
that
is
the
test.
now,
here,
let's
look
at
what
they
did,
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
that.
there
is
a
federal
price
approval
system
that
deals
with
retroactive
prices
for
gas.
because
of
that,
we
have
suspense
royalties.
that
is
the
reason
we
have
the
problem
in
this
case.
the
federal
government
says,
if
you
hold
the
money,
you
have
to
pay
interest
to
the
fellow
you
sold
it
to
at
this
specific
rate
if
we
disallow
the
price.
that
is
the
system.
as
a
result
of
that,
they
hold
the
royalty
owner's
money,
exactly
as
if
they
had
held
the
producer's
money,
exactly.
and
what
does
the
kansas
court
say?
we
will
apply
that
federal
principle.
the
federal
law
created
it.
we
will
apply
it.
there
is
nothing
arcane
or
provincial.
in
fact,
phillips
itself
uses
that
exact
rate
when
it
demands
interest
from
royalty
owners
in
the
precise
circumstances.
when
you
take
those
facts,
we
submit
that
there
was
nothing
arbitrary
and
unfair
in
the
kansas
court
uniformly
applying
the
law
that
it
did,
enshrined
in
kansas
law,
to
the
identical
claims
of
the
class
member.
thank
you.
