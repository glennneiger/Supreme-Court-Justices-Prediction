justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
would
just...
your
submission
is
that
that
is
just
a
limit
on
plaintiff
class
actions?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
isn't
enough
just
to
give
them
an
option
to
opt-out?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
miller,
could
i
interject
here?
do
you
understand
your
opponents
to
suggest
that
the
federal
law
should
govern
in
this
case?
