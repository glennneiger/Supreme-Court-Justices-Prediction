but
these
people
are
michigan
taxpayers
as
well
as
kent
county
or
grand
rapids
taxpayers,
aren't
they?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
feel,
mr.
howard,
that
that
factor
distinguishes
the
parochial
and
sectarian
schools
involved
here
from
other
sectarian
schools
that
have
involved
in
our
earlier
cases?
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
court
in
its
earlier
decisions
assured
that
the
sectarian
schools
really
weren't
sectarian?
justice
rehnquist
most
evidence
in
trials
is
self-serving.
your
remedy
for
that
is
to
cross-examine.
if
you
don't
adequately
cross-examine
a
rebuttal
statement,
the
test
stands.
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you're
designing
school
programs,
maybe
you
can
do
that.
justice
rehnquist
how
would
abdication
tend
to
prove
entanglement?
