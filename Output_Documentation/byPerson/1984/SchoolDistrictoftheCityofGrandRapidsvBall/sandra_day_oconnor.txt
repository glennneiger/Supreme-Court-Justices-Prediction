justice
o'connor
mr.
ripple,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
standing
requirements
are
satisfied
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
was
there
a
challenge
to
the
state
statutes
providing
money,
or
was
it
a
challenge
to
the
grand
rapids
administrative
program?
justice
o'connor
in
that
regard,
mr.
ripple,
do
you
think
there
is
a
greater
entanglement
problem
for
the
community
education
program
than
for
shared
time
because
so
many
of
the
teachers
in
the
community
education
program
are
the
private
school
teachers
who
are
being
utilized?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
a
greater
entanglement
problem
as
a
result?
justice
o'connor
mr.
mcconnell,
do
you
see
any
significant
differences
at
all
in
the
grand
rapids
shared
time
program
and
the
title
i
program?
justice
o'connor
does
the
payment
of
lease
money
to
the
school
constitute
a
significant
difference
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
is
the
supervision
of
teachers
in
the
title
i
program
significantly
greater
than
in
the
grand
rapids
program
by
the
public
school
administrators?
justice
o'connor
do
you
see
a
difference
in
the
community
education
program
and
the
shared
time
program
in
grand
rapids
for
purposes
of
your
comparison?
justice
o'connor
on
that
point,
mr.
mcconnell,
would
it
be
a
different
case
if
one
of
the
non-public
schools
said
we'd
like
to
provide
these
remedial
programs;
we
just
don't
have
enough
money
to
do
it...
because
i
would
think
most
schools
would
like
to
provide
it.
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
o'connor
mr.
howard,
in
this
regard,
is
the
grand
rapids
case
different
from
the
title
i
case
that
we
were
about
to
hear
later
this
morning?
justice
o'connor
is
that
different
from
title
i
programs,
mr.
howard?
justice
o'connor
what
percentage,
mr.
howard?
