harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
ripple,
professor
ripple,
you
feel
the
record
here
is
different
from
that
in
the
recently
decided
missouri
case.
justice
blackmun
would
the
decision
here
govern
and
control
the
missouri
case
if
that
ever
comes--
justice
blackmun
--so
that
the
missouri
case
might
go
the
other
way
on
its
facts.
justice
blackmun
i
want
to
be
sure
of
your
concession
in
that
respect.
