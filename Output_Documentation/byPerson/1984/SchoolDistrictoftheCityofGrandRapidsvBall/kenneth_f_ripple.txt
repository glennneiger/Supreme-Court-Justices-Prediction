mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
of
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
principal
question
is
whether
a
public
school
system,
here
the
grand
rapids
public
school
system,
may
offer
in
leased
classrooms
within
religiously
oriented
non-public
schools,
enrichment
and
remedial
courses
for
the
children
who
regularly
attend
those
schools.
now,
unlike
many
of
the
religion
clause
cases
which
have
come
to
this
court
over
the
last
decade,
this
case
is
here
on
a
full
trial
record.
and
one
of
the
difficulties,
quite
frankly,
judges
have
had
is
analyzing
that
record.
we
have,
first
of
all,
prepared
for
you
a
second
volume
of
the
appendix
which
is
an
index
to
that
record,
and
before
i
get
into
a
full-blown
treatment
of
the
facts,
i
would
also
like
to
mention
three
particular
points
which
i
think
would
help
you
in
analyzing
the
facts
of
this
record.
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
recall
that
there
are
two
very
distinct
programs
involved
in
this
case.
the
first
is
a
shared
time
program.
this
involves
public
school
teachers
teaching
enrichment
and
remedial
classes
in
these
leased
classrooms
during
the
regular
school
day.
the
second
program
is
a
community
education
program.
that
community
education
program
involves
leisure
time
activities,
after
school,
led
by
part-time
grand
rapids
public
school
employees.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
they
are
available
to
the
children
in
the
public
schools
as
well,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
shared
time
program
is
available
as
part
of
the
curriculum
of
the
schools.
the
leisure
time
activities
is
available
not
only
to
the
children
in
the
public
school,
but
also
to
many
other
people
in
grand
rapids.
for
instance,
in
the
local
general
motors
plant,
there
is
a
general
motors
community
education
program
where
they
hire
part...
gm
employees
to
teach
programs
of
leisure
time
activities.
the
second
point
which
i
think
is
important
to
recall
is
that
not
all
of
the
programs
which
were
subject
to
trial
in
this
case
are
here
on
appeal
or
were
before
the
court
of
appeals.
the
only
programs
which
are
before
the
court
today
are
the
following:
first
of
all,
the
shared
time
program
at
the
elementary
school
level
in
remedial
mathematics
and
enrichment
mathematics,
remedial
reading
and
enrichment
reading,
art,
music,
and
physical
education;
secondly,
a
single
secondary
remedial
program
called
math
topics,
designed
to
help
children
who
can't
understand
basic
mathematical
concepts;
and
lastly,
the
community
education
program
at
the
elementary
school
level.
lastly,
i
think
it
would
be...
it
is
important
to
help
you
analyze
this
record
if
i
very
succinctly
state
our
position
in
the
case.
we
submit
that
the
criteria
developed
in
lemon
v.
kurtzman,
when
sensitively
applied,
are
in
fact
adequate
to
resolve
the
constitutional
issue
before
this
court.
we
further
submit
that
a
sensitive
application
of
the
lemon
criteria
requires
that
the
court
ground
its
holding
in
the
actual
record
which
reflects
the
actual
operation
of
the
program.
we
submit
that
before
a
court
frustrates
the
attempt
of
a
local
community
to
give
help
to
11,000
school
children,
it
ought
to
find
in
fact
the
specific
and
actual
consequence
of
that
program
which
violates
the
establishment
clause.
we
further--
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
--we
do
maintain
that
the
standing
requirement
is
not
satisfied.
first
of
all,
we
believe
that
flast
v.
cohen
and
valley
forge
have
not
been
met
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
and
we
also
submit
that
if
this
court
were
inclined
to
view
this
as
municipal
taxpayers
standing,
that
it
is
time
to
review
the
dicta
in
the
mellon
case.
indeed,
it
is...
municipal
taxpayers
standing
does,
in
fact,
allow
a
heckler's
veto
in
this
case,
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
this
program
doesn't
hurt
any
taxpayer
in
that
town,
and
there
was
no
problem
until
the
suit
was
brought.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
it
was
a
challenge
to
the
grand
rapids
administrative
program,
and
not
to
the
legislative
appropriation
of
the
money.
they
did
not
ask
that
the
statute
be
enjoined.
and
the
reason
for
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
legislation
itself
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
shared
time
programs
on
leased
premises.
it's
a
general
appropriations
state
of
money
to
local
school
districts
and
local
school
districts
in
michigan
may
do
what
they
want
with
this
money.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
they
are,
your
honor,
but
they
did
not
attack
a
specific
use
of
the
spending
or
taxing
power
by
the
legislature
of
michigan.
it
is
our
position
that
under
the
flast
holding
and
the
valley
forge
holding,
they
would
be
required
to
do
so;
in
effect,
that
they
have
failed
the
first
prong
of
the
flast
test.
our
submission
is
that
the
difficulty
which
the
lower
courts
have
had
with
this
record
can
really
be
substantiated
in
two
very
succinct
points.
first,
there
is
simply
a
huge
gap
between
the
findings
established
at
trial
in
this
case
and
the
legal
conclusions
of
law
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and,
secondly,
we
submit
that
there
is
evidence
on
the
face
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
a
reason
for
this
disparity
between
the
facts
established
at
trial
and
the
conclusions
of
law
was
the
manifest
preference
of
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
public
as
opposed
to
non-public
education,
a
choice,
we
suggest,
which
is
not
theirs
to
make.
now,
turning
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
record
initially
shows
two
points
which
we
think
are
very
important.
the
first
is
the
religious
plurality
of
this
community
of
grand
rapids,
michigan.
we're
talking
here
of
a
community
with
a
long
tradition
of
religious
plurality.
we're
talking
here
of
not
only
a
strong
catholic
school
system,
but
a
very
strong
christian
school
system
in
the
dutch
reform
tradition
which
has
over
50
different
denominations
under
the
roof
of
its
school.
we're
talking
about
seventh
day
adventist
schools,
we're
talking
about
lutheran
schools.
the
second
significant
point
i
think
the
record
indicates
in
terms
of
a
background
to
this
case
is
the
commitment,
traditionally,
of
the
public
school
board
in
grand
rapids
to
total
community
education.
at
least
in
their
way
of
doing
things,
a
school
board
does
more
than
run
a
public
school
system.
now,
when
you
combine
these
two
factors,
i
suggest,
it
is
quite
obvious
this
local
community
would
want
to,
in
these
programs,
assist
30
percent
of
its
children,
including
a
good
number
of
inner
city
children
who
do
not
attend
public
school,
and
traditionally
whose
families
have
not
gone
to
public
schools.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
when
this
program
was
set
up,
the
grand
rapids
showed
particular
sensitivity
to
the
constraints
of
the
religion
clause
with
respect
to
four
factors
which,
really,
there
was
a
religion
clause
consideration:
the
physical
arrangement,
the
hiring
of
the
teachers,
the
matter
of
supplies,
the
matter
of
teaching
materials.
and
i'd
like
to
address
each
of
those
briefly,
if
i
may.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
physical
arrangements,
the
touchstone
was
legal
and
actual
control
in
public
school
hands.
from
a
practical
point
of
view,
the
hands
of
the
local
community
were
really
very
limited
here.
there
are
no
public
school
facilities
to
which
you
could
take
11,000
children.
the
busing
situation
would
have
cost
$830,000
a
year;
would
have
entailed
moving
small
children
all
over
town,
all
day.
and
many
of
these
kids
are
kids
who
need
teacher
time.
these
programs
are
remedial
programs
in
part.
and,
for
these
reasons,
it
was
decided
that
indeed
the
program
ought
to
be
kept
in
the...
or
it
had
to
be
kept
within
the
local...
within
the
school
of
their
primary
education.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
would.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
we
think
that
the
touchstone
here
ought
to
be
non-core,
non-substitutionary.
we
do
not
believe
and
we
do
not
maintain
that
we
ought
to
be
providing
courses
which
are
necessary
either
for
advancement
in
class
or
for
graduation,
or
that
we
ought
to
be
taking
a
financial
burden
off
a
school
for
running
courses
it
already
maintains.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
well,
that
is
not
this
case,
but
we
believe--
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
--we
think
that
is
a
principle
distinction
to
make
and
it
is
a
good
rule
of
thumb
in
applying
the
lemon
test,
quite
frankly,
because
it
prevents
the
public
school
authorities
from
propping
up
the
primary
educational
mission
of
the
non-public
schools.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
that's
correct.
and
under
the
law
of
michigan,
this
type
of
training
clearly
is
not.
and
there
is
an
independent
state
interest
involved
here.
michigan
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
a
dyslexic
child
can
read.
it
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
someone
understands
basic
math
concepts.
it
has
an
independent
interest
in
promoting
the
cultural
arts
and
in
making
sure
that
people
are
decently
physically
fit.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
it
does,
and
it
requires
that
a
license
be
obtained
by
a
non-public
school
before...
so
that
it
can
engage
in
those
programs.
and
if
it
doesn't,
it
pulls
its
license.
now,
the
same
with
respect
to
teachers
as
well.
we've
tried
to
be
careful
in
the
running
of
this
program.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
it
is
a
different
situation,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
we
submit
that
the
difference
justifies
the
difference
in
treatment.
studies
have
shown
that
unless
you
can
get
12
students
interested
in
a
leisure
time
activity,
you
can't
run
it
fiscally.
the
only
way
you
can
get
12
students
interested,
these
studies
show,
is
in
fact
to
have
the
teacher
be
someone
they
know.
the
gm
local
plant,
the
gm
employee
who
knows
about
rug
hooking
or
something,
that
might
teach
it
at
these
private
schools,
would
be
a
teacher
that
the
students
would
know
and
will
stay
after
class
with.
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
there
is
still
a
public
school
chain
of
command,
first
of
all,
and
secondly
the
nature
of
these
leisure
time
activities
make
the
possibility
of
religious
inculcation
so
slight
that
the
situation
does
pass
muster
under
the
religion
clause
tests.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
it
varies
from
student
to
student,
class
to
class,
but--
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
--no
more
than
10
percent.
that's
the
maximum
figure.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
they
would
be
in
other
classes
during
the
day.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
it
is...
they
are,
as
i
understand
it,
taken
out,
not
from
the
course,
but
from
certain
hours
of
the
course.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
they
are
doing
that.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
yes,
but
they
still
must
take
all
of
the
courses
in
the
school,
so
they
are
in
effect
being
excused
from
class
to
take
the
remedial
or
enrichment
class,
but
still
must--
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
--no.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
but
they
can
have
two
responsibilities
at
once,
and
they
do.
they
still
maintain
responsibility
for
taking
and
passing
the
core
curriculum.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
i
submit
it
is
not
crucial
to
our
case,
simply
because
they
maintain
both
responsibilities.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
they
are
the
same...
the
student...
normally,
the
hours
required
are
somewhat
less
than
children
actually
are
in
school,
i
believe,
in
most
states,
sir.
these
are
normal
school
hours.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
the
students
are
required
to
be
in
the
school
building
at
that
time;
yes.
these
are
the
normally
scheduled
hours.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
yes,
it
does
require
that
they
be
licensed.
and
to
be
licensed,
they
have
to
offer--
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
--the
michigan
statute
says
they
must
give
comparable
education,
and
that
has
been...
to
the
public
schools...
and
that
has
been
interpreted
as
meaning
they
must
give
classes
in
language,
art,
social
studies,
science,
and
mathematics.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
i
believe
they
must
have
a
state
license.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
it
does.
and
these,
of
course,
are
public
school
teachers
who
are
teaching
in
the
shared
time
program
under
the
normal
hiring
practices
of
the
public
school.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
i
believe
they
must
have
a
license
as
well.
that
is
my
understanding.
in
sum,
we
think
we
have
given
one
message
to
the
grand
rapids
community.
we
care.
we
care
about
all
of
you,
and
we
think
that
that
message
is
compatible
with
the
strictures
of
the
religion
clauses.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
is
not
only
a
religion
clause
case,
but
it
also
a
fairness
case.
like
many
very
complex
legal
matters,
it
can
be
reduced
to
elemental
principle.
there
are
two
in
this
case.
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
of
proof.
cases
ought
to
be
decided
on
a
record
of
trial.
now,
with
respect
to
matters
which
have
arisen
over
the
last
few
months,
first
of
all,
there
is
no
art,
music,
or
physical
education
course
in
these
schools
before
the
shared
time
program...
kids
did
draw
pictures.
kids
did
sing
in
the
non-public
schools,
and
they
did
play
in
the
playground
at
recess.
but
we
are
not
talking
about
programmatic
instruction
with
a
specialist
teacher,
and
those
programs
are
in
this
record
of
trial.
the
case
law
of
michigan
does
establish
a
core
curriculum.
statutes
ought
to
be
interpreted
by
virtue
of
the
state
case
law.
it
is
not
true
that
the
non-public
school
teachers
said
who
was
going
to
be
in
those
remedial
classes.
an
independent
screening
was
done
by
the
public
school
teacher
to
determine
who
would
be
in
those
classes.
there
was
one
class
of
people
here,
two
methods
of
delivery
because
of
the
physical
necessity
of
dealing
with
kids
at
two
different
locations.
with
respect
to
the
teacher
hiring,
it
is
important
to
remember
that
every
shared
time
teacher
was
hired
by
the
independent
hiring
process
of
the
public
schools
which,
under
the
union
rules,
require
them
to
take
the
laid-off
public
school
teachers
first,
and
then
applicants
second.
there
were,
at
most,
10
percent
of
the
teachers
in
the
shared
time
program
had
any
denominational
teaching
experience.
at
most.
it's
somewhat
less
because
the
high
school
programs
are
not
involved
in
these
cases.
today,
we
have
seen
the
respondent
basically
take
the
same
position
the
court
of
appeals
took;
that
this
pervasively
religious
atmosphere...
these
are
not
the
schools
bing
crosby
dealt
with
in
bells
of
st.
mary's...
they
are
modern
educational
facilities.
but
the
record
shows
there
was
no
religion
taught
in
these
schools,
that
there
was
no
religious
inculcation.
the
record
shows
that
these
schools
were
relieved
of
no
ongoing
responsibility.
the
record
shows
that
in
fact,
while
there
were
relationships
between
public
and
non-public,
there
were
in
fact
no
impermissible
entanglement.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
we
believe
the
record
in
this
case
does,
in
fact,
substantiate
that
the
relationships
here
were
so
structure
so
that
this
was
a
professional
working
relationship
which,
in
fact,
did
not...
which
did
not
and
could
not
overstep
the
bounds
of
impermissible
entanglement,
mr.
justice.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
we
do
not
believe
that
it
ought
to.
we
believe
that
this
case
should
be
decided
on
the
record.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
we
do,
sir,
because
we
believe
that
what
has
happened
here
is
the
people
of
michigan
have
established
and
structured
a
program
which
is
good
for
them.
mr.
kenneth
f.
ripple
and
we
believe
that
in
that
respect,
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
live
with
their
good
planning.
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
