mr.
ripple,
you
emphasized
in
your
original
three
points,
and
just
now,
the
remedial
character
of
the
program.
would
it
be
a
different
case
if
it
were
a
required
course
such
as
english
literature
or
mathematics?
justice
stevens
and,
if
so,
why?
justice
stevens
but
why
not?
if,
say,
the
non-public
schools
had
difficulty
getting
mathematics
teachers
for
some
reason;
their
pay
scale
isn't
enough
to
attract
mathematics.
why
couldn't
you
help
them
out
that
same
way?
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
i
know
it's
not,
but
you
emphasized
the
difference,
and
i'm
trying
to
understand
why
do
you
emphasize
that
difference?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
remedial
training
is
not
part
of
the
primary
education?
justice
stevens
it
also
has
an
interest
in
having
good
math
teachers
teach
all
the
students.
justice
stevens
do
they
count
toward
the
fulfillment
of
the
hours?
justice
stevens
i
didn't
question
that
distinction.
justice
stevens
and
in
order
to
match
the--
justice
stevens
--you
are
suggesting
they
would
not
bear
this
burden,
even
if
they
could
afford
to
do
it?
they
wouldn't
have
remedial
instruction
for
their
children?
