mr.
ripple,
on
the
enrichment
program,
what
percentage
of
the
regular
school
day
is
taken
up
by--
justice
white
--what's
the
average,
10
percent?
justice
white
what
would
the
students
be
doing
during
the
regular
school
hours
if
they
weren't
in
these
enrichment
classes?
they
would
be
in
some
other
classes,
wouldn't
they?
justice
white
then
isn't
this
a
substitution?
justice
white
well,
nevertheless,
they're
filling
the
time
that
the
private
school
would
otherwise
fill
itself.
justice
white
with
its
own
professors.
justice
white
but
still,
they
can't
be
in
two
places
at
once.
justice
white
so
they
are
in
one
of
these
classrooms
when
otherwise
they
would
be
in
the
private
school's
classroom.
justice
white
well,
i
just
wonder.
if
you
really
think
this
is
crucial
to
your
case,
then
i
think
you
may
have
a
problem.
justice
white
yeah,
all
right.
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
are
the
hours
that
are
devoted
to
this
part
of
the
hours
that
are
needed
to
achieve
a
degree
to
fulfill
what
the
state
standard
is
for
graduation
from
high
school?
justice
white
the
evidence
is
just
to
the
contrary,
isn't
it?
justice
white
wasn't
there
any
evidence,
any
testimony
about
this
at
all?
justice
white
what
about
the
teachers?
justice
white
the
only
evidence
there
is
is
that
they
did
not.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
well,
nevertheless,
i'm
right.
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
mr.
howard,
the
classroom
teacher
can't
force
the
student
into
the--
justice
white
--so
there
is
a
choice
by
the
student
and
the
parent.
justice
white
well,
they
have
the
choice
to
turn
it
down;
right?
justice
white
no.
doesn't
it...
i
thought
you
said
the
student
could
refuse
to
go.
justice
white
you
mean
that
the
school...
the
classroom
teacher
can
assign
and
require
the--
justice
white
--exactly.
justice
white
so,
again,
could
the
student
or
the
parents
of
the
student
say
sorry,
but
we
do
not
want
the
child
to
participate
in
that
program?
justice
white
well,
there
isn't
there
an
answer,
yes
or
no,
to
that?
justice
white
yes,
but
what?
justice
white
then
he
can't
go
in.
justice
white
but
if
he
says
here's
one
that
should
go
in,
the
student
can
say,
and
his
parents
can
say,
sorry,
we
don't
want
him
to.
