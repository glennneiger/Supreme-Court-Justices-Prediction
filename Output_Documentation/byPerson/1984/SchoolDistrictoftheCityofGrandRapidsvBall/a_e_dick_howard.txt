mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
myself,
if
i
may,
to
the
specifics
of
the
actual
operation
of
the
grand
rapids
program
and
touch
three
points.
first,
i'd
like
to
say
something
about
the
nature
of
the
schools
in
question,
specifically
the
pervasive
sectarianism
of
the
schools
being
benefited;
secondly,
say
something
about
the
nature
of
the
aid
itself.
the
particular
effect
of
that
aid
is
to
give
a
direct
benefit
to
these
private
schools
and
in
particular
to
their
religious
mission.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
is
different
in
principle
and
in
fact,
especially
as
we
looked
at
this
particular
case.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
i
would
like
to
develop
that
point,
sir,
if
i
may.
thirdly,
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
the
relationship...
and
this
does
bear,
sir,
on
your
question...
and
that
is
not
simply
the
manner
of
the
aid
or
the
nature
of
it,
but
the
kind
of
relationship
created
between
the
schools
themselves
and
governmental
authorities.
first
a
word
or
two
about
the
schools.
these
schools
in
grand
rapids,
these
non-public
schools,
are
not
schools
in
which
religion
plays
some
incidental
or
subsidiary
role.
these
are
schools
in
which
religion
permeates
and
informs
the
very
reason
for
their
being.
it
is
their
distinguishing
factor.
there
is,
in
the
operation
of
these
schools,
an
integration,
coming
together
of
religious
purpose
and
secular
instruction.
now,
if
one
looks
to
the
record,
one
finds
this
fact
explicitly
affirmed
in
the
prospectuses
and
the
handbooks
and
the
bylaws,
in
the
various
publications
of
each
of
the
schools
that
has
benefited
in
grand
rapids.
one
example
the
handbook
of
the
lutheran
school
in
this
case
says...
and
i
quote:
"all
subjects",...
all
subjects...
"are
taught
with
a
christian
approach
and
from
a
christian
point
of
view.
"
"the
bible
forms
the
core
and
center
upon
which
all
instruction
is
based.
"
if
one
turns
to--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--sir?
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
it's
the
proclamation
of
each
of
these
schools
that
in
their
teaching
of
a
given
subject,
in
each
classroom,
each
subject,
each
course,
that
school
is
dedicated
to
infusing
secular
education
with
a
religious
point
of
view.
now,
your
question,
i
take
it,
deals
with
the
shared
time
courses,
and
there
has
obviously
been
an
attempt
in
the
structure
of
these
courses
to
not
have
religion
inculcated
in
those
classrooms.
the
thrust
of
my
argument
will
be
that
because
these
schools
are
so
pervasively
sectarian,
that
the
operation
of
these
shared
time
and
community
education
courses,
even
assuming
there
was,
in
fact,
no
indoctrination
in
those
classrooms,
will
be
of
direct
benefit
to
the
ongoing
enterprise
of
the
private
school
as
such.
in
addition
to
these
statements
of
purpose
in
the
various
handbooks
and
prospectuses,
one
may
look
to
such
things
as
governance
of
the
schools.
the
boards
of
trustees
or
managers
are
either
elected
by
local
congregations
or
sometimes
have
doctrinal
requirements,
as
is
true
in
the
christian
and
lutheran
schools
here.
the
faculty
of
each
of
these
schools
is
overwhelmingly
of
the
same
religious
persuasion.
for
example,
the
superintendent
of
the
catholic
schools
has
testified
to
the
effect
that
in
addition
to
clergy
and
nuns
who
teach
in
these
schools,
that
90
percent
of
the
lay
faculty
are
catholics.
the
admissions
policies
are
often
limited
by
sectarian
requirements.
the
student
bodies,
as
a
result,
are
strikingly
homogeneous.
for
example,
one
of
the
schools
in
the
case
is
the
immaculate
heart
of
mary
school
which
has
a
student
body
of
424,
of
whom
410
are
catholics.
there
are
requirements
of
religious
instruction
and
exercises.
if
one
looks
to
all
of
these
indicia
and
others,
one
will
find
that
the
schools
dedicate
themselves
to
fully
merging,
in
their
classrooms,
in
their
courses
of
instruction,
both
the
religious
and
the
secular.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
perhaps
the
fullest
record
that
this
court
has
had
in
a
paroch-aid
case
since
the
cases
first
started
coming
to
the
court
in
the
early
'70s
or
early
'60,
and
the
remarkable
thing
about
this
record
is
that
given
the
completeness
of
the
documentation,
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
one
has
to
resort
so
little
to
surmise
about
the
pervasive
sectarianism
of
the
schools,
that
they
look
instead
to
the--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
earlier
cases,
there
were
often
profiles
which
were
indulged
in.
sometimes,
one
would
suppose
that
a
catholic
school
must
therefore
be
pervasively
religious.
as
i
understand
the
court's
decision
upholding
certain
programs
of
aid,
they
basically
are
of
two
kinds.
you
have
the
higher
education
cases
like
hunt
v.
mcnair,
tilton
v.
richardson,
cases
in
which
because
of
the
nature
of
the
student
body,
the
less
impressionable
audience
as
it
were,
the
aid
was
permitted.
the
other
cases
which
took
place
at
the
level
of
primary
and
secondary
schools
were
cases
in
which
the
form
of
the
aid
itself,
for
example,
a
textbook,
a
school
bus,
diagnostic
testing,
et
cetera,
were
aid
of
such
a
kind
that
even
though
the
school
might
be
pervasively
sectarian,
one
saw
no
first
amendment
violation
of
those
facts.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
teaching
of
the
court's
cases
is
that
if
the
record
be
fairly
read
as
finding
these
schools
to
be
pervasively
sectarian,
then,
as
it
was
said
in
meek
v.
pittinger,
that
substantial
aid
to
the
educational
function
of
these
schools
is
necessarily
aid
to
the
religious
enterprise
as
a
whole.
let
me
turn,
therefore,
to
my
second
point.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
shared
time
programs,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
religious
materials
were
used
in
those
classrooms
or
in
fact
that
religious
doctrines
were
taught.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
it's
a
lack
of
evidence,
justice
white.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
rather
odd
to
assume
that
the
lack
of
any
complaint
really
proves
anything.
consider,
if
you
will,
the
classrooms
in
these
schools.
they
are...
and
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
this.
they
are
made
up
entirely
of
students
of
that
same
religious
persuasion.
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
not
one
public
student
ever
attended
a
shared
time
class
in
any
of
the
private
schools
benefited
by
this
program
in
grand
rapids.
that
being
the
case,
you
have
a
sort
of
receptive
audience.
who
would
complain?
not
the
parents
who
have
chosen
religious
education,
not
the
students
who
are
used
to
it,
surely
not
the
schools'
teachers
or
administrators.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
lack
of
complaint
doesn't
really--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--there
was
evidence,
testimony--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--some
of
the
teachers
testified
that
they
did
not.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--if
i
may
say
so,
it's
self-serving
evidence.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
you
are
right
that
the
only
evidence
is
that
the
teachers
in
question
did
not
teach
religion.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
justice
rehnquist,
my
remedy
would
be
to
have
a
mix
of
public
and
private
students
in
the
same
classroom
where
you
then
have
an
automatic
kind
of
safeguard.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
well,
let
me
develop
that
idea,
if
i
may.
but
one
thing
i
think
we
should
get
straight
on
the
record
of
what
happened
in
grand
rapids...
this
goes
back
to
justice
stevens'
point
just
a
moment
ago.
and
that
is
the
question
that
you
put,
sir,
about
the
difference
between
supplemental
and
core
courses.
there's
a
summarical
distinction
being
offered
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
now,
they
have
argued
that
the
shared
time
courses
of
the
community
education
courses
are
supplemental
to
some
kind
of
core
curriculum;
that
they
are
not
required
by
michigan
law.
now,
this
effort
to
divide
the
school
curriculum
into
that
which
is
core
and
that
which
is
supplemental
creates
a
distinction
which
is
nowhere
found
in
michigan
law.
you
will
search
the
code
of
michigan
in
vain
for
any
talk
about
not
only
core
courses,
but
any
courses
at
all.
the
fact
is
that
in
the
michigan
code,
not
only
does
the
code
not
require
the
courses
which
are
here
being
labeled
supplemental,
it
does
not
require
any
other
courses.
so
the
logic
of
the
petitioners'
argument
would
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
the
grand
rapids
school
district
could,
if
it
liked,
other
any
and
all
courses
now
being
offered
by
the
private
schools
in
grand
rapids,
excepting
i
suppose
theology
or
religion.
similarly,
the
state
board
of
education
lays
out
not
requirements
as
to
what
must
be
taught
either
by
the
public
or
the
private
schools
in
michigan.
justice
powell
asked
a
question
earlier
about
accrediting
processes.
in
the
university
of
michigan's
accrediting
process,
there
is
an
accrediting
process
for
high
schools
only.
there
is
not
requirements
laid
down
as
to
the
elementary
schools
in
this
case.
the
accrediting
agency
is
the
north
central
council
of
schools
and
colleges.
there
is,
however,
one
relevant
section
of
michigan
law
that
i
would
call
your
attention
to,
and
that
is
a
section
which
says
that
for
a
child
to
be
relieved
of
the
obligation
to
attend
public
school,
one
must
be
attending
a
private
school
which
offers...
and
i
quote...
"subjects
comparable
to
those
taught
in
the
public
schools,
as
determined
by
the
course
of
study
of
the
public
schools
of
the
district
in
which
the
non-public
school
is
located.
"
so
there
are
two
conclusions
i
would
draw
about
michigan
law.
first
is
that
the
supplemental
core
distinction
does
not
exist.
in
other
words,
each
school
decides
for
itself
what
it
thinks
to
be
core
and
what
is
not.
the
definition,
therefore,
is
totally
elastic.
alternatively,
if
one
turns
to
the
section
that
i
just
quoted,
if
indeed
a
non-public
school
must
teach
those
courses
"comparable
to
the
programs
offered
in
public
schools.
"
that
it
is
not
fair
to
say
that
the
public
fisc
is
not
taking
over
and
relieving
a
private
school
of
courses
which
it
must
offer
by
law,
because
michigan
law,
if
read
this
way,
require
that
kind
of
comparability.
either,
therefore,
one
reads
michigan
law
as
allowing
the
school
district
progressively
to
take
over
the
curriculum,
or
one
reads
it
as
saying
that
the
district
is
in
fact
fulfilling
the
schools'
present
legal
obligations.
either
one,
it
seems,
to
me
runs
into
the
establishment
clause
problem.
now,
let
me
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
argument
that...
which
has
been
made
by
the
petitioners...
that
the
shared
time
elementary
courses
in
this
case
were
not
in
fact
offered
by
the
non-public
schools.
in
other
words,
they
are
in
this
sense
something
new,
something
which
had
not
been
offered
before,--
that,
i
maintain,
is
contrary
to
the
record
in
the
case.
in
fact,
the
non-public
elementary
teachers
of
these
schools
did
teach
these
very
subjects,
albeit
in
more
limited
form.
they
were
simply
not
split
off
as
separate
courses,
but
the
subject
matter
was
in
fact
taught.
there
is
testimony
of
the
superintendent
of
the
grand
rapids
catholic
schools
and
the
principal
of
the
lutheran
school,
both
to
the
effect
that
courses
such
as
art,
music,
physical
education
were
all
taught
by
the
regular
classroom
teacher.
then
came
shared
time
and
these
regular
classroom
teachers
now
do
some
of
those
same
subjects,
but
simply
devote
less
time
to
them.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
they
would
have
taught
remedial
reading.
they
would
have
taught
enrichment
reading,
remedial
math,
enrichment
math,
within
the
scope
of
their
ability
and
their
time.
this
is--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
no
special
classes.
so
it
seems
to
me
to
suggest
that
somehow
because
these
classes
are
being
taught
as
classes,
misses
the
point
that
these
subjects
would
be
taught
in
some
fashion
in
the
regular
classroom.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
well,
justice
o'connor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
grand
rapids
case
has
yet
more
indicia
of
a
public
school
system
taking
over
the
functions
of
a
private
school,
because
in
the
title
i
case,
all
of
the
programs
there
are
remedial.
in
the
grand
rapids
case,
one
has
not
only
remedial
courses,
but
enrichment
courses
as
well,
a
much
fuller
spectrum.
indeed,
it
might
be
worth
noticing
that
in
addition
to
the
courses
which
are
on
appeal
in
this
case,
elementary
school
remedial
math
and
enrichment
match
and
reading,
and
art
and
music
and
physical
education,
that
the
grand
rapids
shared
time
program
has
offered
an
extraordinary
range
of
subjects
at
both
the
elementary
and
high
school
level,
including
things
like
journalism,
spanish,
french,
year
book,
quite
a
remarkable
list
of
courses.
those,
of
course,
would
not
be
involved
in
a
case
such
as
title
i.
consider,
if
you
will,
the
benefits
which
flow
from
this
program
as
i've
described
it,
to
the
private
schools
in
grand
rapids.
to
the
extent
that
classes
are
created,
separate
classrooms
in
which
one
teaches
art,
music,
physical
education,
remedial
subject,
and
enrichment
subjects,
to
that
extent
the
regular
classroom
teacher
can
spend
more
time
with
fewer
students,
doing
a
more
efficient
job
of
that
which
the
school
has
hired
that
teacher
to
do.
and
that
which
the
teacher
is
hired
to
do
is
to
teach
courses
in
a
religious
context
and
a
religious
setting.
i
would
submit,
therefore,
that
this
effort
to
draw
some
kind
of
meaningful
line
between
core
and
non-core
simply
has
to
collapse
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
let
me
turn
now,
if
i
may,
to
the
petitioner's
argument
that
all
non-public
school
children
had
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
challenged
programs.
i
take
this
to
be
a
variation
the
equity
or
child
benefit
theme;
that
the
program
is
somehow
a
program
of
benefit
for
children
and
not
for
schools.
the
fact
of
the
matter,
in
this
case
it
is
the
schools
and
not
the
parents
and
not
the
children
who
make
the
decisions
about
going
into
or
not
going
into
this
program.
in
the
first
place,
each
non-public
school
decides
for
itself
whether
or
not
to
accept
shared
time
with
community
education
classes
at
all.
secondly,
having
made
that
decision,
each
school
decides
for
itself
which
of
those
courses
it
wants.
thirdly,
once
those
courses
are
in
operation,
it
is
the
regular
classroom
teacher
who
teaches
math
and
reading
who
will
decide
which
students
are
to
be
offered
to
the
shared
time
classroom.
so
at
every
important
decisionmaking
point
in
the
chain,
the
decisions
are
not
those
of
parents,
not
those
of
individual
students,
but
decisions
of
the
schools
themselves.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
there
is
some
of
the
same
opportunity
in
title
i
for
a
non-public
school
to
opt
out
of
the
program
if
they
see
fit,
and
i
can't,
on
the
face
of
it,
see
a
dispositive
difference
there.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
justice
white,
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
well,
not
really.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
if
the...
turn
it
down
by
whom,
the
school
or
the--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--no,
i'm
sorry,
sir;
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
that--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--the
regular
classroom
teacher,
the
private
school
teacher
decides
which
of
his
or
her
students
need
remedial
work--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--or
would
profit
from
enrichment
work,
and
sends
those
children
to
the
public
employee
who
is
teaching
shared
time
courses.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
that
would
be
a
negotiating
process,
no
doubt,
between
parents
and
school.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
the
answer
is
yes,
but.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
and
the
yes,
but...
the
"but"
part
is
that
if
the
regular
classroom
teacher
thinks
that
the
student
would
not
benefit
and
therefore
doesn't
send
that
child
for
it--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--that's
right.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
the
parent
could
say
no
to
that.
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
yes,
sir;
they
were.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
michigan
has,
as
i
understand
the
state
system,
a
very
decentralized
sort
of
educational
system.
there
are
a
few
states
in
which
textbooks
are
approved
at
the
state
level.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
true
in
virginia,
true
in
texas,
true
in
some
others.
my
understanding
in
michigan
is
that
those
choices
and
those
approvals
would
be
made
by
local
school
districts
subject
to
the
general
supervision
of
the
superintendent
of
education.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
as
i
understand
michigan,
it's
striking
in
the
degree
of
autonomy
it
gives
to
its
local
school
districts.
milliken
v.
bradley,
for
example,
turned
on
that
very
point.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
and
are
therefore
approved
by
the
public
authorities.
yes,
sir;
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
that
would
be
correct.
just
as
the
teacher
who
teaches
the
shared
time
course
will
be
teaching
essentially
the
same
course,
whether
he
or
she
happens
to
be
in
a
public
school
or
happens
to
be
in
a
private
school.
yes,
sir;
that's
correct.
let
me
turn,
if
i
may,
to
another
argument
that
the
petitioners
have
made.
and
that,
in
effect,
is
that
there
is
not
a
narrow
class
of
religious
beneficiaries.
and
this
is
another
variation
on
the
child
benefit
argument,
the
argument
being
that
there
is
no
preference
being
given
to
religious
students,
because
the
same
subjects
are
available
through
the
public
schools
to
students
there;
that
there's
a
comparability
in
terms
of
subject
matter.
i
think
it's
simply
not
fair
to
say
that
there's
one
class.
as
i
view
the
program
in
grand
rapids,
there
are
two
generically
distinct
classes
of
students,
and
therefore
two
generically
distinct
programs.
one
of
those
programs
is
in
the
public
schools,
open
to
all
students
who
take
part
and
teaching
the
shared
time
courses.
the
other
is
the
program
which
operates
in
the
religious
schools,
and
which
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
not
one
public
school
student
has
ever
attended.
so
that
program,
the
second
program,
the
one
being
challenged
here,
is
one
in
which
there
is
total
identity
of
the
students
in
those
shared
time
classrooms
with
the
religious
persuasion
of
that
particular
private
school--
and
that,
i
think,
makes
this
a
distinct
program
and
therefore,
in
effect,
a
double
benefit
to
the
private
schools.
one
has
in
the
first
place
the
enlarging
of
the
school's
curriculum,
the
opportunity
for
the
school
to
offer
additional
courses
which
it
might
not
otherwise
be
able
to
fund
or
might
not
wish
to
fund,
the
opportunity
to
sort
of
siphon
off
the
slowest
and
the
fastest
students
from
various
classrooms,
and
have
those
taught
at
public
expense,
but
of
top
of
that
sort
of
financial
benefit,
one
has
the
benefit
that
this
program
operates
entirely
within
the
religious
school,
entirely
on
its
premises,
and
the
students
who
are
being
taught
are
entirely
of
that
school,
and
no
mix
with
any
other.
let
me
turn,
finally,
to
my
third
point
which
is
that
of
excessive
entanglement.
this
is
a
claim
in
the
case
by
the
petitioners
that
the
court
below
has
in
effect
neglected
the
record,
that
there
is
per
se
reasoning
in
the
air.
now,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
that
by
way
of
suggesting
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
sixth
circuit,
it
may
do
so
without
resort
to
hypotheticals
or
suppositions
or
profiles
or
anything
outside
the
record.
it
seems
to
me
the
actual
relationship
between
the
grand
rapids
school
district
and
the
private
schools
being
benefited
is
ample
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
first,
a
word
about
the
actual
entanglement.
this
is
not
hypothetical
or
supposed,
but
the
actual
relationship
which
goes
on
between
the
grand
rapids
school
district
and
the
non-public
schools.
first,
in
the
community
education
program,
there
is
a
complete
merger
of
the
administration
of
that
program,
because
the
administrators
of
the
non-public
schools
are
hired
to
be
the
coordinators
of
the
community
education
program.
this
is
true,
for
example,
at
several
of
the
catholic
schools
in
grand
rapids.
secondly,
as
to
the
hiring
of
teachers,
i
think
this
is
a
question
that
justice
o'connor
touched
on
a
moment
ago,
virtually
every
one
of
the
community
education
courses
at
a
private
religious
school
in
grand
rapids
is
taught
by
a
full-time
employee
of
that
school,
not
by
people
brought
in
from
the
outside,
but
by
teachers
already
known
to
be
part
of
that
religious
community.
thirdly,
as
to
the
assignment
of
shared
time
teachers,
a
fair
number
of
those
shared
time
teachers
had
been
employees
of
private
religious
schools,
were
then
hired
by
the--
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
--about
10
percent,
justice
o'connor.
something
like...
it
depends
on
which
programs
we
are
counting...
between
10
and
13
in
absolute
number,
or
about
10
percent
of
the
shared
time
teachers.
and
these
teachers
were
hired
by
the
public
and
sent
back
to
those
same
private
schools.
perhaps,
most
importantly,
there
is
an
abdication
by
the
grand
rapids
school
district
of
control
over
many
aspects
of
the
program.
it
has
no
control
over
the
enrollment.
it
can
refuse
to
offer
the
program,
but
once
it's
offered
it,
the
decision
as
to
which
students
will
be
enrolled
are
the
decisions
at
the
outset
of
the
schools
themselves.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
it
would
mean
that
you're
taking
public
money,
public
programs,
putting
those
programs
into
the
hands
of
religious
authorities,
letting
them
make
decisions
about
allocation
of
resources,
which
seems
to
me
a
classic
case
of
entanglement.
there
are
also
actual
entanglements
in
the
days
of
operation,
the
hours
of
operation.
school
holidays
are
basically
worked
out
by
the
private
school.
parent-teacher
conferences
are
worked
out
by
the
private
school.
the
public
really
has
no
control
over
that.
the
cases
of
this
court
have
made
statements
that
the
state
must
be
certain
that
the
state
aid
does
not
result
in
religious
inculcation.
now,
one
need
not
resort
to
that
language,
though
it
is
the
language
of
the
cases.
however
one
characterizes
that
obligation,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
escaping
that
the
state
has
an
affirmative
obligation,
once
the
plaintiff
has
shown
that
there
are
facts
giving
rise
to
a
sufficient
danger
of
forbidden
effect.
and
i
would
characterize
it
somewhat
as
follows.
the
more
pervasively
the
sectarian
school,
the
greater
the
benefit
conferred
by
the
state,
the
more
closely
related
the
aid
to
the
school's
instructional
process,
as
these
courses
are,
and
the
greater
the
actual
entanglement
of
the
kind
i've
described,
then
the
greater
the
duty
imposed
upon
the
state
to
ensure
that
and
show
that
it's
ensured
that
the
forbidden
effect
does
not
come
to
pass.
in
the
everson
case
in
1947,
the
court
said
the
following:
neither
a
state
nor
the
federal
government
can
openly
or
secretly
participate
in
the
affairs
of
any
religious
organizations
or
groups,
or
vice
versa.
the
grand
rapids
program
violates
this
injunction
because
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
shared
responsibility.
recently,
this
court,
in
larkin
v.
grendel's
den,
cautioned
against...
and
i
quote...
"the
mere
appearance
of
a
joint
exercise
of
legislative
authority
by
church
and
state
because
of
the
significant
symbolic
benefit
to
religion.
"
in
the
grand
rapids
program,
we
have
not
only
the
appearance,
but
the
fact
of
a
joint
exercise
of
authority
by
religious
schools
and
public
authorities
over
programs
which
are
publicly
funded
on
those
schools'
premises.
mr.
a.
e.
dick
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
simply
drawing
upon
the
principle
that
lies
behind
the
grendel
case,
which
makes
it
clear
that
when
you
merge
authority
over
decisions
in
the
public
arena,
you've
entangled
church
and
state.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
analogy
in
this
case
is
the
merger
is
so
many
points
of
operation
of
this
program.
let
me
finally
dwell
on
this
point.
to
put
all
these
pieces
together,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
this
case
should
not
turn
either
on
isolated
facts
or
on
sweeping
generalizations
about
the
grand
rapids
program.
we
should
look,
as
the
lemon
v.
tilton...
kurtzman
case
has
instructed,
to
the
program's
cumulative
impact,
not
simply
a
piece
at
a
time,
but
all
of
it
put
together.
consider,
if
you
will,
the
cumulative
impact
of
the
following
factors:
first,
that
public
employees
at
public
expense;
secondly,
teach
on
the
premises
of
pervasively
sectarian
schools;
third,
that
they
teach
courses
of
substantive
instructional
content,
involving
ongoing
student-teacher
contact;
fourth,
that
there
is
no
mix
of
students...
the
students
are
all
of
the
same
religious
school;
fifth,
that
we're
talking
not
about
college
students,
but
about
students
at
the
most
impressionable
age,
the
elementary
schools;
sixth,
that
some
of
these
courses,
community
education,
are
taught
by
full-time
teachers
of
the
same
school;
seventh,
that
it
is
the
school
and
not
the
parents
or
the
students
who
decide
what
will
be
offered;
and
finally,
that
there
is
the
appearance
and
the
fact
of
a
joint
exercise
of
authority.
my
submission,
therefore,
would
be
that
this
program
in
grand
rapids
has
become,
for
all
practical
purposes,
a
functional
part
of
the
religious
schools'
curriculum
and
instructional
program.
and
it's
hard
for
me,
therefore
to
imagine
a
more
palpable
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
