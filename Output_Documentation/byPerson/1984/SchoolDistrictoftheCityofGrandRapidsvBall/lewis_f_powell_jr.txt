may
i
ask,
mr.
ripple,
does
the
state
require
certification
of
private
schools?
justice
jr.
do
they
have
to
be
accredited
in
terms
of
approving
them
as
suitable
to
educate
children
for
higher
education?
justice
jr.
do
the
teachers
have
to
be
certified
by
the
state
board
of
education?
justice
jr.
and
that
requires
a
certain
level
of
training
to
teach.
justice
jr.
i'm
asking
about
teachers
in
general
at
private
schools.
justice
jr.
that's
all
i
really
wanted
to
know.
mr.
howard,
are
the
books
and
instructional
materials
used
in
the
shared
time
program
provided
by
the
state?
justice
jr.
does
michigan
approve
textbooks
and
classroom
materials?
justice
jr.
that's
true
in
virginia.
justice
jr.
there's
some
flexibility
in
virginia
for
local
school
boards
to
make
choice
of
additional
text
material,
but
it
has
to
be
approved
by
the
state.
justice
jr.
but
the
material
used
in
the
shared
time
program
is
approved
by
their
local
school
board?
justice
jr.
the
same
material
used
in
both
public
and
private
schools.
