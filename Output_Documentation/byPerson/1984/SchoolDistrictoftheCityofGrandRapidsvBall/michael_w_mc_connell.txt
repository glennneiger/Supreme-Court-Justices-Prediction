mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
grand
rapids
is
not
alone
in
its
decision
to
provide
supplemental
educational
services
to
school
children
in
the
schools
that
they
regularly
attend,
whether
those
schools
are
public
or
non-public.
indeed,
it's
an
extremely
common
practice
under
title
i
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965,
and
is
a
practice
that
has
been
explicitly
blessed
by
congress.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
your
honor,
i
see
some
relatively
minor
differences.
i
see
none
that
in
our
view
should
be
of
decisive
significance.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
that
is
a
difference.
under
the
title
i
program,
there
is
no
least
payment
to
the
private
schools.
the
record
here
shows
that
that
lease
payment
is
based
on
an
objective
analysis
of
the
actual
cost
of
maintenance
of
the
classrooms
and
thus
if
for
value
received.
i
think
that
it
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
financial
subsidy,
but
rather
as
an
actual
arms-length
purchase
of
the
facilities,
and
on
that
basis
i
would
think
that
it
would
not
be
distinguishable.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
your
honor,
you
should
understand
that
the
precise
arrangements
for
the
title
i
administration
vary
from
school
district
to
school
district.
the
basic
contours
of
the
supervision
in
both
programs
as
i
understand
it
is
essentially
the
same,
and
it
is
this:
that
the
teachers
who
are
providing
the
services
on
the
private
schools
are
supervised
to
the
same
extent
and
for
the
same
ends
as
the
teachers
would
be
in
the
public
schools
themselves.
in
many
cases
they
are,
in
fact,
the
same
teachers,
as
you
see
in
the
record
here.
an
individual
teacher
may
be
teaching
in
both
public
schools
and
private
schools.
the
teacher
is
itinerant
and
the
relationship
of
that
teacher
to
his
or
her
supervisors
does
not
change
merely
because
of
a
different
building.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
there
are
two
difference
between
the
title
i
program
and
the
community
education
program.
first,
the
community
education
program
does
employ,
on
a
part-time
basis,
teachers
from
the
regular
private
schools;
and
secondly,
in
a
few
instances,
the
administration
of
the
community
education
program
is
also
handled
by
personnel
of
the
private
schools.
both
of
these
practices
would,
in
fact,
be
illegal
under
title
i
and
do
not
exist
in
title
i.
and,
your
honor,
we
do
believe
that
this
is
significant,
but
i
would
say
this
in
defense
of
the
community
education
program;
that
it
is
really
a
different
type
of
program
altogether
than
an
educational
supplement
within
the
private
schools,
because
it's
truly
a
community-wide
program.
factories,
hospitals,
senior
citizen
centers,
and
it's
leisure
time
activities;
it
isn't
the
type
of
teaching
that
has
concerned
this
court
in
its
decisions
in
this
area.
and
on
that
basis,
i
think
that
it
may
be
subject
to
a
certain
degree
of
more
latitude,
because
it
doesn't
present
the
same
problems,
your
honors.
as
professor
ripple
mentioned,
the
essential
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
the
gap,
as
he
puts
it,
between
the
factual
findings
and
the
factual
record
and
the
legal
conclusions
in
the
case.
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
four
particular
examples
of
that,
and
i
select
these
because
they
are
principles
or
aspects
of
the
grand
rapids
program
which
it
has
in
common
with
the
title
i
program,
and
thus
i
think
it
is
of
particular
importance
to
this
court.
we
also
believe
that
each
of
them
is
constitutionally
significant,
although
perhaps
not
individually
decisive.
the
first
is
neutrality.
it's
quite
important
that
this
program
treats
all
children
alike,
without
regard
to
whether
they
are
attending
public
schools
or
non-public
schools,
and
without
regard
to
what
religious
sects
they
may
belong
to.
in
this
respect,
it
is
not
possible
to
say
that
this
program
constitutes
a
preference
or
an
establishment
of
a
religious
sect.
it
simply
respects
the
choices
that
parents
and
children
have
independently
made.
secondly,
is
the
secular
character
of
this
program.
the
program
provides
the
same
classes,
that
is,
the
same
topics,
indeed
the
same
curriculum,
in
many
cases
by
the
same
individual
teachers,
but
certainly
all
of
the
teachers
under
the
same
control
and
with
the
same
training,
in
both
the
public
schools
and
the
private
schools.
there
has
been
no
instance
of
religious
indoctrination
in
this
program,
as
even
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
in
its
opinion.
the
purposes
of
this
program
are
purely
secular
and
the
methods
selected,
including
the
placement
of
the
program
on
the
premises
of
the
private
schools,
is
solely
for
sound
educational
reasons.
this
is
not
a
program
which
is
designed
to
prop
up
or
benefit
or
help
religious
schools.
it
is
an
educationally
oriented
program,
entirely
secular
in
character.
the
third
point
professor
ripple
has
already
touched
on
in
some
detail.
that
is,
that
the
program
is
supplementary
in
the
sense
that
it
provides
services
that
would
not
otherwise
be
available
to
the
children
in
these
private
schools.
justice
white
asked
some
questions
concerning
this
distinction,
and
certainly
the
distinction--
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
the
distinction
that
is
considered
important
here
is
that
these
are
services
that
the
schools
would
not
otherwise
provide,
and
thus
that
the
children
would
not
otherwise
receive.
we
do
believe
that
that's
important
for
determining
that
the
benefit
of
this
program
is
for
children,
and
it's
not
a
benefit
that
flows
to
a
religious
institution.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
it
would,
because
if
the
principle
were
that
any
services
that
a
private
school
might
conceivably
and
desirably,
given
infinite
resources,
provide
to
the
students
could
be
provided,
and
that
that
were
a
constitutionally
valid
way
of
looking
at
the
program--
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
--that
would
mean
the
transportation,
textbooks,
any
forms
of
assistance
that
have
been
approved
by
this
court
as
being
benefits
to
the
children,
would
become
suspect.
we
believe
the
test
is
whether,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
private
schools
are
being
relieved
of
an
obligation
or
financial
burden
that
they
would
otherwise
bear.
we
think
this
is
important,
not
just--
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
--if
they
had
infinite
resources,
i
suspect
that
they
would
provide
not
only
this,
but
also
transportation
and
textbooks
and
numerous
other
benefits
as
well.
we
believe
that
the
child
benefit
theory
would
altogether
collapse
if
that
were
the
test
to
be
applied.
let
me
stress
that
this
is
important,
not
just
constitutionally
from
not
benefitting
the
religion,
but
it's
also
important
educationally,
because
the
purpose
of
these
programs
as
an
educational
matter
is
to
provide
services
to
children
who
would
not
otherwise
receive
them.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
this
respect
that
title
i
has
exactly
the
same
supplement,
not
supplant
provisions
as
applied
to
public
schools
as
it
does
to
the
private
schools.
the
point
here
is
to
enhance
educational
opportunities
for
children
that
they
would
not
otherwise
receive.
the
fourth
specific
point
where
the
factual
record
and
the
legal
conclusions
of
the
court
of
appeals
simply
are
not
consistent
is
that
this
program
is...
and
here
i
am
talking
specifically
about
the
shared
time
program
in
connection
with
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier
this
program
is
truly
separate
and
independent
of
the
private
school
control.
it
is
controlled
exclusively
by
public
school
districts.
the
public
school
curriculum
is
used.
the
teachers
are
hired,
assigned,
supervised,...
if
needs
be,
fired...
exclusively
by
the
public
schools.
the
shared
time
teachers
are
subject
to
precisely
the
same
forms
of
supervision
in
the
public
as
in
the
private
schools.
the
private
school
role
in
the
matter
is
exceedingly
limited.
their
responsibilities
are
essentially
two:
they
provide
a
religiously
neutral
classroom
that's
empty,
for
use
by
the
shared
time
teachers;
and
they
perform
very
minor
administrative
scheduling
functions.
the
consequences
of
this
is
that
the
occasions
for
government
intrusion
into
the
religious
aspects
of
these
schools
are
minimal.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
your
honor,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
public
school
officials
do
attend,
on
a
regular
and
non-announced
basis,
the
classes
conducted
by
the
public
schools.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
practice
is,
on
a
general
basis,
once
per
month.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
know
that
that
is
the
case
with
respect
to
the
title
i
program
in
new
york
city,
and
i
believe
that
i
recall
that
that's
in
the
record
in
this
case
as
well.
