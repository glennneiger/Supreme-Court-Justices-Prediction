justice
white
could
i
ask,
mr.
attorney
general,
before
the
1864
treaty,
the
indians
had
aboriginal
title
to
a
much
larger
area?
justice
white
and
part
of
the
treaty
was
ceding
all
but
the
reservation?
justice
white
and
was
there
any
express
mention,
in
ceding
the
non-reservation
lands,
was
there
any
mention
of
ceding
fishing
rights
also?
justice
white
i
take
it
that
the
indians
before
the
treaty
had
fishing
rights.
justice
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
white
how
did
they
lose
their
aboriginal
fishing
rights
in
the
area
that
was
not
included
in
the
reservation?
justice
white
just
by
quit
claiming
their
right,
title,
and
interest
to
all
that
land
except
the
reservation?
justice
white
it
didn't
mention
fishing
rights,
though.
justice
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
white
i
was
just
pointing...
that
they
lost
fishing
rights
by
a
general
cession.
justice
white
and
you
are
arguing,
i
suppose,
that
when
the
reservation
was
diminished,
their
fishing
rights
were
in
the
diminished
area
or
in
the
area
that
was
excluded
were
lost
for
the
same
reason.
justice
white
and
that
is
true,
you
say,
no
matter
what
happened
later
before
the
indian
claims
commission.
justice
white
well,
they
were
paid...
they
had
another
proceeding
before
the
indian
claims
commission?
justice
white
so
you
say
that
the
indian
claims
commission
proceeding
has
no
bearing
on
this
general
cession
language.
justice
white
did
i
understand
you
to
say
earlier,
mr.
attorney
general,
that
the
additional
$4
million
awarded
by
the
indian
claims
commission
was
measured
by
lumber
and
something
else?
justice
white
lumber
and
grazing.
justice
white
and
that
was
very
similar
to
the
language
in
the
1864
treaty?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
has
passed
to
whom?
justice
white
the
title
was
given
up
to
the
united
states,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
and
it
was...
the
land
became
part
of
national
forest
mostly,
or
parks?
justice
white
well,
normally
state
hunting
and
fishing
laws
apply
in
national
forests
and
parks,
don't
they?
justice
white
well,
could
i
ask
you,
if
the
cession
language
in
the
1906
agreement
didn't
extinguish
fishing
rights
in
the
property
that
was
ceded,
why
would
indian
fishing
rights
have
been
extinguished
in
1864
in
the
property
that
was
ceded?
justice
white
do
you
concede
that
indian
fishing
rights
on
the
land
that
was
ceded
in
1864
were
extinguished?
justice
white
well,
it
didn't
mention
fishing
rights
off
the
reservation.
justice
white
and
neither
did
the
1906.
justice
white
it
just
said...
i
suppose
the
cession
language
is
even
more
specific
in
the
1906
agreement.
justice
white
in
1864?
justice
white
if
there
were
a
specific
case,
you
probably
wouldn't
be
here,
either
one
of
you.
justice
white
--could
i
ask,
does
the
history
show
why
the
indians
sold
or
why
the
united
states
bought
that
land
that
had
been
erroneously
surveyed
as
outside
the
reservation?
they
hadn't
been
settled
to
any
extent.
why
didn't
they
just
include
those
lands
in
the
reservation
instead
of
having
a
cession
and
payment,
things
like
that?
you
can
make
an
argument
on
the
other
side
that
if
the
indians
decided
to
sell
it,
they
didn't
think
this
area
was
so
important
to
them,
if
there
weren't
any
settlements
around.
why
didn't
they
just
stick
to
the
original
boundary
of
the
reservation?
justice
white
that
may
be
so,
but
if
you
assume
that
the
1906
agreement
ceded
all
rights,
all
that
happened
before
the
indian
claim
commission
was
that
they
reevaluated
whatever
was
ceded.
justice
white
i
agree,
but
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
1906
agreement.
justice
white
okay.
