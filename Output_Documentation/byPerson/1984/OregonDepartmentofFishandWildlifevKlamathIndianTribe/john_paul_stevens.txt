justice
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us,
general
frohnmayer,
whether
the
state
required
non-indians
to
have
licenses
to
hunt
and
fish
during
this
period?
justice
stevens
so
really
what
was
happening
here,
they
just
weren't
enforcing
those
against
the
indians.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
thought
that
is
troubling
me?
your
argument
is
that
on
the
valuation
point,
omitting
the
hunting
and
fishing
isn't
significant
because
the
timber
and
the
grazing
was
the
highest
and
best
use
for
the
land,
and
therefore
an
appropriate
measure
of
use,
and
therefore
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
other
uses.
but
does
that
totally
meet
the
argument
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
might
be
not
pertinent
to
the
land
at
all,
but
a
separate
bundle
of
rights
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be
included
within
the
valuation.
that
is
part
of
their
argument,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
perhaps,
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
point,
you
are
saying
that
although
theoretically
they
could
exist
separate
and
apart
from
a
piece
of
land,
they
don't
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
well,
if
the
cession
language
in
the...
was
it
1906?
justice
stevens
if
the
cession
language
in
the
1906
agreement
didn't
extinguish
fishing
rights
in
the
land
that
was
ceded,
i
would
suppose
that
the
indians
would
still
retain
the
fishing
rights
in
all
the
land
they
gave
up
in
1964.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
may
i
inquire
what...
i
gather
none
of
the
land
did
go
into
private
ownership
in
the
disputed
area
here,
but
had
it
gone
into
private
ownership...
say
they
had
settled
a
couple
of
hundred
acres
or
something...
would
you
claim
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
on
that
private
land,
hunt
and
fish
on
it?
justice
stevens
so
it
is
just
a
right
to
be
free...
and
earlier
you
said
you
had
four
game
wardens
of
your
own,
or
enforcement
personnel
within
the
tribe.
justice
stevens
do
they
have
enforcement
duties
in
the
area
that
is
involved
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
before
the
case
started,
did
they
have
such
responsibility?
justice
stevens
the
record
doesn't
tell
us.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
supposing
you
win
the
case.
what
would
their
responsibility
be
in
the
area
of
this
case,
these
four
indian
game
wardens
or
whatever
the
proper
title
is?
would
they
have
some
kind
of
jurisdiction
over
what
happens
in
this
area?
justice
stevens
do
they
have
limits,
too,
on
how
much--
justice
stevens
--so
there
would
be
two
sets
of
rules
on
the
limits
that
could
be
taken
from
this
area,
one
that
would
apply
to
the
indians
and
one
that
would
apply
to
the
non-indians.
justice
stevens
and
how
to
fish.
i
mean,
i
suppose
there
are
some
regulations
on
how
fish
may
be
taken.
justice
stevens
have
we
held
that
such
rights
survive
where
you
have
both
the
conveyance
of
the
entire
property
interest
and
also
the
diminishment
of
the
reservation?
justice
stevens
well,
here
you
have
the
two
things
combined.
i
don't
think
you
contest
the
fact
that
not
only
was
the
interest
in
the
real
estate,
the
land
conveyed,
but
also
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation
became
smaller
as
a
result
of
that
conveyance.
justice
stevens
and
often
you
might
have
it
survive...
say
you
conveyed
land
within
a
reservation.
why,
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
might
well
survive
within
the
reservation.
justice
stevens
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any
cases
in
which
you
have
the
two
factors
conjoined
in
which
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
have
survived,
both
the
conveyance
of
the
property
and
the
reduction
in
the
size
of
the
reservation.
justice
stevens
wasn't
winans
the
construction
of
a
treaty
which
specifically
referred
to
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights?
justice
stevens
that
was
my
recollection.
justice
stevens
mr.
miller,
let
me
interrupt
you
once
more.
menominee
kind
of
cuts
both
ways.
aren't
there
two
parts
to
menominee?
in
the
first
part
they
had
a
conveyance
somewhat
like
this,
and
they
said
that
took
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
along
with
it,
didn't
they?
in
other
words,
there
was
both
a
conveyance
of
the
land,
i
thought,
without
any
reference
to
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
which...
i
don't
remember
the
exact
language,
but
the
court
said,
well,
that
implicitly
took
with
it
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
and
then
there
was
the
second
part,
on
which
you
rely.
justice
stevens
they
cite
this
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
their
brief.
justice
stevens
that's
right.
i'm
referring
to
the
language
that
created
the
reservation.
it
created
the
reservation
by
conveying
the
land,
in
effect,
and
it
said
nothing
at
all
about
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
justice
stevens
but
implicitly
it
was
assumed
that
that
must
have
gone
with
the--
