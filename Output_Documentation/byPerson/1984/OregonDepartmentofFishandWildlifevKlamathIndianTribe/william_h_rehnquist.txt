justice
rehnquist
i
am
a
little
curious
as
to
what
that
stipulation
reflects.
the
state
of
oregon
didn't
try
to
regulate
the
indians
in
the
national
forest
when
they
fished,
or
they
thought
they
were
regulating,
but
the
indians
thought
they
weren't?
justice
rehnquist
was
that
the
language
of
the
1906
agreement?
they
grant,
bargain,
and
sell
all
right,
title,
and
interest,
or
something
to
that
effect?
justice
rehnquist
what
is
your
response,
mr.
miller,
to
your
opponent's
contention
that
it
is
a
kind
of
peculiar
right
that
has
evolved?
it
is
not
good
on
private
lands,
apparently,
yet
it
is
not
good
against
the
federal
government,
and
he
says
it
must
once
have
been
an
exclusive
right.
how
did
it
become
so
diminished?
justice
rehnquist
are
there
other
cases
in
which
other
indian
tribes
have
the
right
broken
down
this
way,
where
their
right
doesn't
extend
to
going
on
private
land,
and
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
being
free
from
state
regulation?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
there
hadn't
been
that
much,
mr.
miller?
suppose
that
there
had
just
been
language
saying,
we
transfer,
grant,
bargain,
sell,
and
convey
all
of
our
right,
title,
and
interest,
whatever
we
may
have,
in
these
lands
that
are
now
being
excluded
from
the
reservation.
do
you
say
that
fishing
rights
wouldn't
pass
under
that
sort
of
cession
language?
do
you
see
what
i
mean?
justice
rehnquist
so,
if
there
were
just
nothing
relevant
on
either
side
on
that,
that
general
language
would
not
be
sufficient,
i
take
it.
justice
rehnquist
let
me
elaborate
a
little
bit.
i
think
your
opponent
takes
the
position
that
if
i
as
a
seller...
or
i
as
a
buyer
come
to
you
as
a
seller
and
say,
look,
i
see
you've
got
an
acre
of
land
for
sale,
i
think
it
is
first-rate
residential
property,
and
that
would
be
worth
$10,000,
an
acre
of
residential
property,
so
i
offer
to
buy
that
land
from
you,
and
you
give
me
a
deed
to
it,
a
grant
deed.
you
can't
come
back
the
next
day
and
say,
well,
i
am
starting
to
farm
on
this
corner
of
the
property,
because
all
you
bought
from...
all
i
sold
you
was
the
residential
value
of
the
property.
he
is
saying
that
in
effect
the
fact
that
fishing
rights
may
not
have
been
expressly
included
doesn't
mean
that
when
the
indians
say
we
convey
everything
they
don't
convey
fishing
rights,
too.
now,
what
is
your
response
to
his...
as
i
understand
his
position?
justice
rehnquist
so
it
is
basically
not
a
property
right
at
all,
but
kind
of
a
freedom
from
state
regulation.
