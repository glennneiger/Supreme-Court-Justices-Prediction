mr.
david
frohnmayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
statement
of
oregon
appears
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
this
case
presents
an
opportunity
to
avoid
an
unwarranted
conflict
between
important
principles
of
indian
treaty
law
and
the
fundamental
sovereign
powers
of
states
over
public
lands
and
their
regulatory
dominion.
that
conflict
would
threaten
important
environmental
and
wildlife
management
policies
of
state
and
federal
government.
the
question
is
posed
by
the
unambiguous
language
of
a
congressionally
ratified
agreement.
that
agreeded
ceded
reservation
lands,
and
as
all
parties
agree,
diminished
the
physical
size
of
the
klamath
indian
reservation.
in
these
circumstances,
can
tribal
members
nonetheless
hunt
and
fish
on
the
ceded
land
without
observing
state
regulation
which
applies
to
all
other
oregon
citizens
on
that
public
land?
language,
authority,
and
logic,
we
believe,
require
a
negative
answer
to
this
question.
the
ninth
circuit
decision
below
ignores
the
act
of
indian
reservation
diminishment,
and
the
decision
below
also
ignores
the
explicit
treaty
language
which
limits
the
right
in
question
to
the
reservation
itself.
we
will
argue
today
for
a
general
rule
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
that
rule
would
provide
that
where
the
reservation
boundaries
are
diminished,
and
where
treaty
rights
are
defined
by
the
reservation
area,
those
rights
may
only
be
exercised
in
the
reduced
area
unless
congress
specifies
its
intention
to
preserve
them.
but
on
the
contrary,
if
treaty
hunting
and
fishing
or
other
rights
are
not
limited
by
the
reservation
boundaries,
they
remain
unaffected
by
the
diminishment
unless
the
congress
clearly
modifies
and
expresses
its
intent
to
reduce
them.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
yes,
very
clearly.
yes,
very
clearly
they
can.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow
the
second
part
of
your
question,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
i
don't
think
so,
and
this
anticipates
an
argument
i
would
make
in
a
moment,
but
i
will
reach
it
now,
and
that
is
that
the
language
of
the
treaty
is
very
careful
to
express
that
the
hunting
and
fishing...
or
that
the
fishing
rights
are
"within
its
limits",
and
then
when
it
goes
on
in
the
same
sentence
to
confer
the
gathering
rights
given
to
the
tribe,
those
are
also
expressed
as
within
the
limits.
so,
two
different
phrases
within
the
same
session
which
creates
the
rights
also
explicitly
limit
those
rights
to
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
and
if
one
looks
to
the
purpose--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--yes,
because
it
is
a
reservation...
it
is
the
creation
of
on
reservation
rights.
now,
when
congress
at
this
time
wanted
to
create
rights
which
existed
off
an
indian
reservation,
it
knew
how
to
do
so.
this
court
in
the
classic
case
of
winans
is
a
perfect
example
where
fishing
at
the
usual
and
accustomed
places
identifies
geographic
locations
which
may
be
removed
from
the
meets
and
bounds
of
a
specific
reservation.
so,
a
treaty
may
create
off-reservation
rights,
but
these
rights
in
the
specific
grant
by
congress
are
unequivocally
within
the
limits
of
the
reservation,
and
that
is
part
of
what
we
think
are
the
undisputed
facts
here,
and
let
me
touch
them
briefly.
in
the
1864
treaty,
the
tribe
ceded
$20
million...
or
20
million
acres
of
aboriginal
lands
and
received
a
reservation
of
some
$1.9
million.
the
language
of
sale
of
the
aboriginal
lands
is
clear.
the
tribe
ceded
all
their
right,
title,
and
claim.
and
as
i
have
mentioned
in
my
answer
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
the
treaty
provided
for
exclusive
fishing
rights
in
the
streams
and
lakes
included
in
said
reservation.
the
gathering
rights
were
also
restricted
within
its
limits.
the
language
was
later
construed
by
court
decision
to
include
hunting
rights,
but
the
treaty
provides
on
its
face
and
by
no
fair
reading
for
any
off-reservation
rights.
subsequently
it
was
demonstrated
that
surveys
erroneously
had
excluded
some
621,000
acres
from
the
tribal
lands
in
the
reservation,
and
other
poundary
commission
proceedings
and
a
new
survey
during
which
time
the
tribe
was
represented
by
independent
legal
counsel,
it
was
agreed
that
the
boundary
dispute
would
be
resolved.
the
tribes
agreed
to
cede
to
the
united
states
those
disputed
621,000
acres
in
exchange
for
approximately
$533,000.
a
1969
indian
claims
commission
decision
later
awarded
the
indians
$4
million
more
for
this
to
compensate
for
this
transaction.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
in
the
claims
commission,
counsel
for
both
parties
agreed
that
they
should
be
compensated
at
fair
market
value
and
at
the
highest
and
best
use.
it
was
agreed
by
the
parties
in
those
claims
commissions
that
the
highest
and
best
use
was
for
timber
and
grazing,
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
compensation.
the
1906
agreement
which
ratified
the...
the
1906
cession
act
which
ratified
the
bilateral
agreement
provided
in
article
1,
and
this
language
is
particularly
important,
that
the
klamath
indians
do
"hereby
cede,
surrender,
grant,
and
convey
to
the
united
states.
"
all
their
claim,
right,
title,
and
interest
in
and
to
the
erroneously
surveyed
lands.
in
its
recitation
of
consideration,
article
2
of
that
same
cession
act
provided
that
this
was
satisfaction
"in
full
of
all
claims
and
demands
of
said
klamath
or
other
indians
arising
or
growing
out
of
the
erroneous
survey.
"
no
express
reservation
was
made
in
this
1906
act
for
any
residual
hunting,
fishing,
or
gathering
rights
on
the
ceded
lands
or
indeed
on
any
off-reservation
areas.
the
federal
government
immediately
placed
most
of
this
land
in
crater
lake
national
park
or
in
national
forests.
the
parties
stipulated
that
the
indians
continued
to
hunt,
fish,
and
trap
on
the
excluded
lands
without
regard
to
state
regulation,
but
also
that
they
were
unaware
of
any
denial
by
the
tribe
that
the
state
lacked
this
regulatory
power,
at
least
until
proceedings
were
instituted
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
the
latter
construction
is
probably
correct,
and
of
course
the
state
was
a
stranger
to
the
agreement
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
tribes.
the
state
has
its
regulatory
authority
by
virtue
of
the
joint
agreement
with
the
federal
government
which
ordinarily
asks
states
to
manage
lands
and
manage
wildlife
within
the
national
forests
in
their
boundaries.
and,
of
course,
enforcement
of
game
and
fishing
laws
are
a
discretionary
matter
with
the
states,
although
we
need
to
go
somewhat
beyond
the
record
to
amplify
it.
in
1906,
this
was
a
very
sparsely
inhabited
area
in
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
the
record
is
silent
on
that
point,
but
i
am
certain
from
everything
i
know
about
the
history
of
enforcement
of
oregon
game
and
fish
laws
that
seasonal
limits,
bag
limits,
and
license
requirements
would
be
required
uniformly
of
persons
not
of
the
tribe.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
that
is
apparently
so.
the
stipulation
speaks
in
terms
of
the
parties
being
unaware
of
that
extent.
the
ninth
circuit
below
affirmed
the
summary
judgment
for
the
tribe
in
its
action
to
enjoin
state
regulation.
it
found
that
these
rights
were
not
appurtenant
to
the
property,
and
that
they
survived
and
were
not
inconsistent
with
the
cession
agreement.
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
has
traveled
on
an
unnecessary
collision
course
with
three
massive
obstacles.
the
first
of
them
is
the
stark
and
clear
language
of
the
1864
treaty,
which
confines
hunting
and
fishing
rights
to
reservation
boundaries.
the
second
is
the
unambiguous
language
of
the
cession
agreement,
which
sold
and
ceded
the
land
and
thereby
diminished
the
reservation
boundaries.
the
third
analytical
roadblock
is
the
absence
of
any
explicit
regrant
by
congress
of
a
tribal
right
to
hunt
or
fish
on
those
ceded
lands
free
of
normal
state
regulation.
let
me
now
expand
on
those
points.
the
1864
treaty
provisions
on
hunting,
fishing,
and
gathering
rights
specify
the
boundaries,
and
the
operative
words
are
"within
said
reservation"
and
"within
its
limits".
the
treaty
does
not
refer
to
aboriginal
rights.
it
does
not
refer
to
any
off-reservation
rights.
it
does
not,
as
some
treaties
of
time
time
would
have,
refer
to
geographically
undefined
usual
and
accustomed
places
of
fishing,
such
as
were
found
in
the
antoine--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
no,
the
cession--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--aboriginal
fishing
rights,
yes.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
yes,
throughout
the--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--by
virtue
of
the
treaty,
justice
white.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
yes.
well,
the
language--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--it
didn't
mention
any
rights.
it
referred
to
the
rights
by
geographic
area.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
nor
has
this
court,
to
my
knowledge,
in
any
place
when
a
general
cession
of
land
is
made
to
the
united
states
specifically
required
the
separate
itemization
or
valuation--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--that's
right,
for
which
they
were
paid.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
argument,
and
that
is
an
argument
which
would
follow
from
my
ambiguous
language
of
sale
and
cession
where
in
the
first
instance
the
fishing
right
is
defined
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
as
being
within
the
reservation
boundaries.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
well,
they
were
not
paid
separately
as
an
itemization,
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
they
were
paid
to
extinguish
the--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--they
were
not
paid
separately
for
the
fishing
rights,
justice
marshall,
but
i
think
that
is
a
question
of...
the
compensation
issue
is
two
steps
removed.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
david
frohnmayer
you
are
paying
for
the
land
and
all
that
is
appurtenant
to
the
land.
the
highest
and
best
use
agreed
by
the
parties,
including
by
the
tribe,
was
that
that
was
fair
market
value.
when
a
house
is
sold,
separate
valuations
are
not
given
for
the
attic
or
for
the
foundation.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
that's
correct.
we
are
relying
on
two
things.
first
is
the
nature
of
the
treaty
right
which
is
created
in
1864,
which
defines
it
within
the
territorial
confines
of
the
reservation,
and
then
we
are
relying
on
the
unambiguous
language
of
the
cession
agreement,
which
could
not
be
more
precisely
suited
to
effective
diminishment--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--i
am
not
sure
i
follow,
justice--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
the
indian
claims
commission
bears
only
on
the
adequacy
of
the
compensation
that
was
given
for
the
cession.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
and
grazing--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--because
that
was
the
highest
and
best
use
for
the
land,
as
agreed
by
counsel
for
both
parties,
the
tribe
and
the
united
states.
that
compensation
was
for
the
land
area
that
was
taken.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
well,
the
language
of
the
cession
agreement,
which
is
the
language
which
is
unambiguous.
when
congress
wanted
to
preserve
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
the
ceded
areas,
it
knew
how
to
do
so.
page
28,
footnote
5
of
our
opening
brief
cites
authority
to
this
court
in
which
it
was
regarded
at
the
time
as
the
normal
practice,
that
when
the
congress
of
the
united
states
wished
the
tribes
to
retain
aboriginal
hunting
or
fishing
rights
or
earlier
hunting
and
fishing
rights
within
the
area
to
be
ceded,
they
knew
how
to
do
so
and
they
said
so,
and
that
was
something
for
which
there
was
bargain
and
sale.
and
so
what
we
have
is,
the
very
silence
of
the
cession
agreement
indicates
that
the
language
of
it,
which
is
precisely
suited
to
effect
a
diminishment,
as
this
court
found
in
de
coteau
and
in
footnote
22
of
de
coteau
where
it
cites
additional
treaties
at
the
time.
the
contemporaneous
practice
was
perfectly
clear
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
and
its
intention
to
see
that
the
reservation
boundaries
were
diminished
is,
i
think,
unassailable.
let
me
return
to
the
question
on
which
i
had
a
colloquy
with
justice
marshall
a
moment
ago,
because
the
tribe's
position
on
compensation
is
anomalous.
bear
in
mind
that
the
fishing
rights
at
issue
here
were
exclusive
fishing
rights
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
the
tribe
has
conceded,
apparently
without
much
argument,
that
it
lost
exclusivity
of
those
fishing
rights,
and
now
seeks
to
say
that
because
it
was
not
compensated
for
what
obviously
is
the
far
lesser
value,
if
indeed
there
is
any
value
at
all
in
being
subject
to
state
regulation,
that
therefore
that
lack
of
compensation
shows
that
congress
must
not
have
intended
to
do
what
it
did
in
the
cession
language,
and
that
is
to
include
everything
in
the
sale.
we
think
the
tribal
argument
is
inconsistent,
necessarily
inconsistent
by
not
complaining
of
the
greater
deprivation
of
the
asserted
right,
and
at
the
same
time
saying
that
the
presence
of
the
lesser
deprivation
without
compensation
therefore
must
mean
that
congress
must
not
have
intended
to
include
these
rights
because
they
were
not
included
in
the
sale.
we
think
that
when
the
argument
is
pursued,
it
falls
of
its
own
weight.
tribes
retain
no
beneficial
interest,
as
this
court
has
found
was
sufficient
in
some
cases,
the
ash
sheep
case,
for
example.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
and
i
will
confess,
justice
stevens,
that
we
are
perplexed
by
that
argument,
because
the
question
that
must
be
posed
to
the
tribe,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
kind
of
right
is
it
that
is
being
claimed
if
it
is
not
a
treaty
right
or
if
it
is
not
an
occupancy
right?
the
treaty
gives
two
conceivable
bases
on
which
that
right
could
be
urged,
the
exclusive
right
to
occupy
the
land
or
the
fact
that
the
treaty
confers
the
right
to
fish,
gather,
and
hunt
within
its
limits.
but
when
both
of
those
potential
theoretical
bases
are
destroyed
by
a
cession
agreement
with
respect
to
some
part
of
the
land,
then
what
theoretical
basis
is
left
to
assert
that
these
are
not--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--that's
right.
in
many
treaties,
or
at
least
in
some
treaties
which
have
reached
this
court,
it
is
clear
that
the
treaty
right
to
hunt
and
fish
can
not
only
not
be
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
but
it
can
be
on
the
columbia
river
many
miles,
for
example,
from
the
akima
tribe's
reservation,
and
this
court
has
held
that
where
those
conditions
exist,
the
treaty
right
is
protected
and
is
not
appurtenant
to
the...
but
here,
the
only
two
bases
on
which
we
can
find
for
the
assertion
of
hunting
and
fishing
right
in
the
ceded
area
is
either
that
they
come
from
the
right
to
occupy,
which
no
longer
exists,
or
from
the
treaty
language
creating
the
rights,
which
says
within
its
limits
and
within
said
reservation.
but
consider,
if
you
will,
this
anomaly.
the
western
part
of
the
ceded
land
lies
squarely
within
the
boundaries
of
crater
lake
national
park.
congress
has
prohibited
hunting
altogether
in
national
parks,
and
has
required
that
fishing
be
done
only
with
hooks,
and
yet
by
the
reasoning
that
the
tribe
now
urges
on
us,
either
the
tribe
has
a
right,
because
that
was
ceded
land,
to
hunt
and
fish
free
of
state
regulation,
or
it
does
not,
because
the
federal
government
can
bar
it.
so,
not
only
have
they
started
from
an
exclusive
treaty
right
within
the
reservation,
the
right
asserted
now
becomes
one
which
is
nonexclusive,
nonuniform,
because
it
apparently
does
not
apply
as
against
the
federal
government
or
private
landowners,
and
can
be
exercised
only
to
prohibit
state
regulation.
it
is
an
anomalous
right
which
is
being
asserted
today,
and
one
which
analytically,
i
think,
cannot
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
language
and
the
law
that
is
asserted
to
have
created
it.
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
believe
that
the
very
analysis
scheme
which
the
tribe
urges
today
would
cause
this
court
to
unravel
all
tribal
cession
agreements
since
the
creation
of
this
nation
unless
the
congressional
language
in
that
cession
agreement
explicitly
extinguished
hunting
and
fishing
rights
on
the
ceded
land.
we
have
yet
to
find
a
treaty
that
does
so
explicitly,
and
that
presumably
is
one
of
the
reasons
which
motivated
this
court
in
the
de
coteau
decision
to
stay
and
to
look
to
how
unequivocal
the
language
of
bargain
and
sale
is
in
the
cession
agreement
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
precisely
suited
to
effect
a
diminishment.
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
it
was.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
yes,
it
was,
justice
white.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
you
mean
1864?
mr.
david
frohnmayer
yes,
if
this
is
not
language
of
extinction
of
rights
in
and
to
the
land,
it
is
difficult
to
know
what
language
would
accomplish
that
objective
unless
it
is
the
claim
of
the
tribe
that
for
everything
that
was
of
value
to
the
tribe,
there
must
be
a
specific
inventory
in
the
document
of
bargain
and
sale
to
give
some
valuation
to
that
right
or
show
that
it
was
conveyed.
one
good
example
of
that,
a
right
which
was
perhaps
not
important
at
the
time
except
that
we
know
that
crater
lake
was
a
sacred
place
for
the
klamath
tribe
as
it
indeed
is
for
anyone
who
witnesses
it,
but
the
western
boundary
of
the
claimed
land
was
right
on
the
rim
of
crater
lake,
of
inestimable
value
now
for
recreational
and
aesthetic
purposes.
there
was
no
specific
recitation
in
the
cession
agreement
in
1906
putting
a
value
on
this
land
separate
and
apart
from
fair
market
value.
is
it
to
be
said
now,
then,
that
because
the
cession
agreement
was
silent
with
respect
to
particular
items
of
valuation,
that
the
language
of
bargain
and
sale
of
cession,
of
giving
up
all
right,
title,
claim,
and
interest
is
to
be
regarded
as
ineffective
as
against
that--
mr.
david
frohnmayer
--let
me
read
it
precisely.
it
appears
on
page
3
of
our
petition
for
certiorari.
the
klamath
indians,
and
i
quote,
justice
rehnquist,
"do
hereby
cede,
surrender,
grant,
and
convey
to
the
united
states
all
their
claim,
right,
title,
and
interest
in
and
to.
"
these
excluded
areas.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
the
language
in
the
1864
treaty
was
that
they
cede
all
their
right,
title,
and
claim.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
ironically
enough,
the
language
in
the
1906
agreement
is
almost
identical
to
the
language
used
in
the
decoteau
tribe
agreement,
which
this
court
found
was
precisely
suited
to
effective
diminishment
of
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
the
tribe
rests
its
argument
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
other
than
on
a
somewhat
self-contradictory
theory
of
the
origin
of
these
rights,
on
article
4
of
the
cession
agreement.
we
believe
that
they
have
misconstrued
article
4.
article
4,
by
its
terms,
is
a
savings
clause.
it
grants
no
new
rights.
it
is
typical
of
boilerplate
language
used
in
tribal
agreements
of
that
period.
in
reading
that
clause
to
grant
off-reservation
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
by
its
terms
be
inconsistent
with
the
treaty
language
that
establishes
those
rights
within
the
reservation.
bear
in
mind
the
purpose
of
article
4
is
to
keep
the
1864
treaty
and
the
1906
cession
consistent
with
each
other.
and
yet
what
an
inconsistency
that
would
wreak,
because
instead
of
on-reservation
exclusive
rights
to
hunt
and
fish
and
gather,
their
reading
of
article
4
would
create
off-reservation,
non-exclusive,
and
non-universal
rights,
because,
for
example,
of
the
national
parks
and
because
they
concede
that
they
can't
hunt
and
fish
on
private
land,
at
least
without
the
consent
of
the
landowner.
the
rights
that
article
4
was
meant
to
save
are
plain
within
the
balance
of
any
fair
reading
of
the
1864
treaty.
that
treaty
gave
allotments
in
perpetuity.
it
gave
tax
exemptions
to
indians.
it
gave
family
inheritance
rights
to
indians.
it
exempted
the
tribal
annuity
from
individual
debts.
it
protected
the
klamath,
modoc,
and
yahooskin
band
of
the
snake
indians
from
forfeiture
of
their
particularly
valuable
land
in
case
other
tribes
were
put
there.
that
is
what
a
savings
clause
is
intended
to
give.
it
doesn't
confer
new
rights.
moreover,
the
tribe
has
given
us
arguments
which
for
four
separate
reasons
we
believe
should
fail.
they
acknowledge
diminishment
but
give
it
no
legal
significance.
they
ask
to
rewrite
the
treaty
by
utterly
ignoring
in
their
briefs
the
limitations
of
"within
said
limits"
and
"within
the
reservation"
language
that
is
used
in
the
treaty.
they
would
expand
the
cession
act
to
include
a
new
off-reservation
interest,
and
they,
we
believe,
misread
the
cases,
which
clearly
augur
in
favor
of
the
state's
position.
the
first
group
of
their
cases
reserves
off-reservation
rights.
the
second
group
of
their
cases
are
ones
in
which
the
cession
agreement
actually
reserves
rights
on
the
ceded
land,
and
in
the
third
group
of
cases
that
they
cite,
the
cession
agreement
doesn't
diminish
the
reservation
boundaries.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
briefly,
six
points,
which
i
believe
will
not
require
all
the
time
that
i
have
reserved.
first,
i
must
respectfully
submit
that
opposing
counsel
has
done
in
oral
argument
precisely
what
he
has
done
in
the
briefs,
and
that
is
to
confuse
the
language
of
article
4,
which
does
not
speak
to
purposes
of
the
cession
agreement.
it
talks
about
provisions
of
the
agreement.
provisions
are
clear,
and
speak
for
themselves,
and
do
not
require
psychoanalysis
of
the
parties
or
the
congress
which
enacted
it.
the
second
point
is
that
we
have
referred
in
our
opening
argument
to
the
anomaly
created
by
the
special
situation
of
crater
lake
national
park,
the
largest
part
of
the
western
cession
boundaries.
federal
law
has
since
time
immemorial,
at
least
since
the
creation
of
the
park,
prohibited
hunting
altogether
on
that
piece
of
ceded
property,
and
yet
it
is
anomalous
because
the
right
asserted
is
the
right
of
subsistence
to
hunt
and
fish
and
the
allegedly
onerous
nature
of
state
regulations,
which
simply
have
bad
limits
and
season
limits.
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
its
share
of
those
lands
in
the
national
park
prohibits
hunting
altogether,
and
yet
no
mention
of
how
this
is
to
be
reconciled
with
the
theoretical
position
of
the
tribe
has
yet
been
offered
by
our
opponents.
that
leads
to
the
point
that
we
have
heard
no
argument
about
the
source
of
this
asserted
right.
that
source
can
only
come
from
one
of
four
sources:
aboriginal
right,
the
treaty
right
of
1864,
the
1906
cession
agreement,
or
some
other
contemporaneous
act
of
congress
which
regranted
to
the
tribe
the
authority
to
hunt
and
fish
as
it
had
before
on
the
ceded
land,
and
in
fact
none
of
those
first
three
sources
is
conceivably
the
source,
and
therefore
we
must
look
to
the
fourth.
justice
stevens
asked
our
worthy
opponents
for
authority
for
their
proposition,
a
point,
i
believe,
echoed
by
justice
white.
indeed,
the
authority
cited
is
quite
contrary.
the
blackfoot
treaty
which
was
cited
as
an
example,
as
counsel
explained
to
this
court,
where
the
cession
agreement
explicitly
reserved
hunting
and
fishing
rights
on
the
ceded
land
until
such
time
as
they
were
open
to
the
public.
the
winans
case
is
a
case
where
a
treaty
explicitly
reserved
off-reservation
rights.
the
antoine
case
is
a
case
in
which
the
cession
agreement
explicitly
reserved
rights
to
hunt
and
fish
on
the
ceded
land,
and
in
fact
on
page
28,
footnote
5
of
our
brief,
we
cite
authority
to
the
proposition
that
when
congress
wanted
to
reserve
rights
on
ceded
land,
the
normal
practice
was
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
say
so,
and
it
did.
justice
stevens
in
his
colloquy
with
opposing
counsel
asked
about
the
opposing
interests
of
the
state
in
the
varieties
of
fish,
game,
and
other
wildlife
management.
justice
stevens,
that
is
not
in
the
stipulations
of
the
parties,
but
in
the
motions
to
stay
the
district
court
proceedings,
the
opposing
views
of
counsel
and
affidavits
with
respect
to
the
various
practices
are
included
in
the
record,
and
that
may
serve
to
answer
your
question
there
if
that
is
a
residual
issue.
the
point
that
the
state
raises
is
that
the
normal
practice
if
something
is
other
than
a
complete
sale
and
cession
and
giving
up
of
all
rights
in
a
cession
agreement
is
for
the
congress
to
have
said
so.
the
congress
knew
how
to
say
so.
the
congressional
language
is
clear
and
undeniable,
and
yet
the
tribe
shrinks
in
horror
at
the
notion
that
with
respect
to
land
which
is
admittedly
no
longer
in
tribal
domain
but
in
the
public
domain,
that
the
same
rules,
the
same
regulation
to
enhance
wildlife
and
to
protect
the
environment
should
apply
to
tribal
members
as
well
as
to
all
the
members
of
the
public.
we
believe
that
the
intention
of
congress
is
otherwise,
and
that
the
ability
of
the
state
to
regulate
this
land
with
an
even
hand
in
the
interests
of
enhancing
its
wildlife
resource
ought
to
be
preserved
as
against
the
theory
which
has
no
true
basis
in
analytical
consistency
that
we
can
discover.
thank
you
very
much.
