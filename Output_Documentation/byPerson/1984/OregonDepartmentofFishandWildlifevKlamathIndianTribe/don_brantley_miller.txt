mr.
don
brantley
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
rights
at
issue
here
today
are
basic
subsistence
rights
that
continue
to
this
day
to
play
an
extremely
important
role
in
the
day
to
day
lives
of
the
klamath
tribe
and
its
members.
they
are
treaty
rights
that
have
been
exercised
continuously
in
the
ceded
area
since
before
the
1864
treaty
to
the
present
time,
and
they
are
rights
that
have
a
very
direct
impact
on
how
the
indians
live
their
lives,
and
affect
directly
their
ability
to
provide
food
for
themselves
and
their
families.
indeed,
the
parties
here
have
stipulated
that
in
addition
to
the
indians'
continuous
use
in
this
area,
these
rights
were
crucial
to
the
survival
of
the
klamath
indians
at
the
time
of
the
1906
cession
act,
and
that
they
continue
to
this
day
to
play
a
highly
significant
role
in
the
lives
of
the
klamath
indians.
now,
no
doubt
because
of
this
fundamental
importance
to
the
livelihood
and
existence
of
the
indians,
congress
and
this
court
have
traditionally
been
highly
protective
of
treaty
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
this
right
to
hunt
and
fish
free
of
state
regulation
has
long
been
regarded
as
more
than
a
mere
jurisdictional
prerogative
of
the
indians.
rather,
it
has
been
regarded
as
an
important
treaty
right
for
the
extinguishment
of
which
just
compensation
must
be
paid.
now,
in
this
case
and,
with
all
due
respect,
contrary
to
mr.
frohnmayer's
assertion,
we
would
assert
that
there
really
is
no
practical
reason
why
the
1906
act
should
not
be
construed
as
preserving
the
tribe's
treaty
rights.
because
the
1954
klamath
termination
act
preserved
these
same
treaty
rights
to
hunt
and
fish
on
lands
that
were
subject
to
that
act,
the
klamath
indians
now
possess
a
decreed
right
to
hunt
and
fish
free
of
state
regulation
over
roughly
two-thirds
of
their
1864
treaty
reservation,
an
area
of
approximately
one
million
acres,
and
those
lands,
like
the
lands
at
issue
here
today,
were
sold,
purchased
by
the
federal
government,
and
placed
in
the
national
forest.
now,
tribal
law
governs
its
members'
exercise
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights
on
those
lands.
the
tribe
has
cooperative
agreements
with
the
state
of
oregon,
the
forest
service,
u.s.
fish
and
wildlife
service.
it
has
a
wildlife
code
that
establishes
seasons
and
taking
limits.
it
issues
id's
to
its
members,
and
it
employs
a
wildlife
biologist
and
four
tribal
enforcement
officers.
so,
whether
the
tribe
retained
its
treaty
rights
to
hunt
and
fish
on
the
additional
one-third
of
that
1864
reservation
that
was
ceded
in
1906,
and
which
lands
are
comprised
of
essentially
similar
forest
lands
even
today,
is
probably
not
of
major
practical
consequence
to
the
state
of
oregon,
and
the
record
in
this
case
certainly
would
indicate
nothing
to
the
contrary.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
well,
i
think
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
that
the
situation
of
the
klamath
indians
is
peculiar
as
well.
their
reservation
has
been...
the
entire
treaty
reservation
has
now
been
terminated,
and
they
have
retained
rights,
non-exclusive
rights
on
the
other
two-thirds
of
the
reservation.
now,
we
certainly
admit
that
when
these
lands
were
sold,
when
all
right,
title,
and
interest
was
ceded,
then
the
exclusive
right
to
hunt
and
fish
on
those
lands
passed
with
the
title
to
the
land,
and
therefore
we
assert
no
interest
against
the
private
landowner.
now,
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--your
honor?
mr.
don
brantley
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
virtually
all
of
it.
the
record
indicates
that
about
1
percent
of
the
land
had
been
entered
for
settlement.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
that's
entirely
correct,
your
honor.
our
assertion
here
is
simply
that
the
nature
of
the
right
that
we
assert
is
really...
has
two
parts
to
it,
or
if...
i
mean,
you
can
break
it
down
into
two
part.
one
is
the
exclusive
right
to
enter
on
the
land
and
reduce
fish
and
game
to
possession.
the
other,
and,
we
would
submit,
the
far
more
important
right
in
this
case,
is
the
right
to
be
free
from
state
regulation,
and
those
have
always
been
considered
the
perhaps
two
important
elements
of
indian
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
it
is
a
hybrid
right.
it
is
not
simply
a
regulatory
right.
it
is
not
simply
a
property
right.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
well,
we
are...
i
am
aware
of
only
one,
which
was
a
blackfeet
cession
act
in
1891,
i
believe.
in
that
case,
the
right
in
the
ceded
lands
of
the
tribe
was
retained
as
long...
to
hunt
and
fish
in
the
ceded
lands
as
long
as
they
remained
public
lands,
but
they
specifically
held
or
specifically
stated
that
those
rights
would
be
exercised
subject
to
state
jurisdiction.
so,
they
did
break
it
down.
they
recognized
they
would
retain
the
right
to
go
on
as
long
as
they
were
public
lands,
but
applied
state
regulation.
so
congress
knew
how
to
apply
state
regulations
in
that
area
if
it
wanted
to.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
no,
your
honor.
well,
we
would
claim
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
free
of
state
regulation.
we
would
not
assert
any
rights
to
enter
the
land
over
the
objection
of
the
landowner.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
yes.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
well,
pending
the
resolution
of
this
case--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--i
can't
tell
you,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
the
record
has
nothing,
and
i
can't
tell
you.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
they
would
have
jurisdiction
over
only
tribal
members
hunting
and
fishing.
it
would
be...
and
the
state
of
oregon
would
have
jurisdiction
over
non-klamath
tribe
members
hunting
and
fishing,
and
the
klamath
tribe
issues
tribal
identification
cards
to
its
members,
and--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--they
have
limits.
they
open
areas.
they
close
areas.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
i
assume
that
there
are
as
well,
your
honor,
but
that
is
really
not
the
major
bone
of
contention
here.
due
to
the
number
of
dams
on
the
klamath
river,
there
were
a
whole
lot
of
fish
back
at
the
time
of
this
agreement,
and
there
aren't...
i
mean,
there
are,
i
suppose,
some
trout
fishing
or
something,
but
it
is
not
a
major
salmon
fishery
as
it
was
before.
well,
mr.
frohnmayer
has,
i
believe,
correctly
pointed
out
that
this
case
does
present
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
to
abrogate
treaty
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
the
context
of
a
combination
of
factors
that
have
not
before
been
considered
by
the
court.
but
the
lower
court
decision
here
certainly
doesn't
represent
a
significant
departure
from
the
principles
that
have
been
announced
in
the
court's
earlier
treaty
property
rights
cases
and
hunting
and
fishing
rights
cases.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
your
honor,
this
court,
i
believe,
has
never
required
an
express
or
explicit
extinguishment
of
a
treaty
for
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
absolutely,
and
i
will
tell
you
why,
because
there
was
a
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent
in
that
case
as
opposed
to
in
this
case.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
they
are
close
to
the
same,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
one
is
more
specific
than
the
other.
but
you
have
to
look
to
the
purposes
of
the
two
acts.
the
purpose
of
the
1864
treaty
was
specifically
to
provide
an
area
in
which
the
indians
could
continue
to
be
self-sufficient
through
hunting
and
fishing,
and
indeed
the
record
here
shows
that
the
indians
specifically
bargained
for
the
inclusion
of
these
ceded
lands
within
their
reservation
because
of
their
value
for
hunting
and
fishing,
and
the--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--in
1864,
yes.
the
treaty
commissioner
had
initially
proposed
to
lay
out
a
reservation
on
the
floor
of
the
klamath
basin
and
exclude
the
up
slopes
and
valleys,
and
the
indians
said,
no,
you
can't
do
that.
these
lands
must
be
included
because
they
form...
provide
us
with
a
major
part
of
our
subsistence.
and
so
the
government
acceded,
and
they
acceded
to
the
indians'
request
because
they
were
aware
that
the
klamath
reservation
was
simply
too
high
and
too
cold
to
support
any
meaningful
agriculture,
and
the
treaty
provided
for
absolutely
no
support
whatsoever
of...
i'm
sorry.
it
provided
for
some
support
initially
in
the
first
few
years,
but
it
provided
for
no
long-term
support
of
the
indians
by
the
government.
so,
the
government's
intent
was
to
provide
an
area
that
would
be...
where
the
indians
could
be
self-sufficient
through
hunting
and
fishing,
and
the
treaty
specifically
reserves
fishing
rights,
so
when
the
indians
voluntarily
agreed
to
come
on
that
reservation
after
having
bargained
for
the
inclusion
of
their
hunting
and
fishing
grounds,
then
that
probably
is
a
clear
enough...
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
that
is
a
clear
enough
expression
of
intent
of
the
parties
there
to
constitute
an
abrogation
of
those
aboriginal
rights.
but
here
we
are
talking
about
treaty
rights.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
again
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
act
and
what
the
intent
of
the
parties
and
the
understanding
of
the
indians
was
at
the
time.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
i--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--well,
briefly,
it
is
that
the
right
that
we
assert
is
not
a
right
that
is
appurtenant
to
the
land.
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
an
easement,
and
it
does
not
diminish
in
any
respect
whatsoever
the
new
landowner's
interest
in
the
property.
we
only
maintain
that
we
retain
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
with
the
permission
of
the
landowner.
in
the
case
of
the
forest
service
lands,
if
hunting
is
permitted,
then
we--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--it
is
a
freedom
from
state
regulation
that
has,
because
of
its
unique
character
as
such
an
important
right
to
the
indians,
that
has
some
of
the
characters
of
a
property
right.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
compensable
right.
it
is
a
property
right
within
the
sense
of
the
fifth
amendment.
if
it
is
taken
away,
then
compensation
must
be
paid.
but
it
is
not
an
interest
in
the
property
that
is
ceded.
this
court
has
recognized,
and
i
think
maybe
this
could
answer
some
of
the
concerns
in
terms
of
whether
this
decision
is
breaking
tremendous
new
ground
or
not,
this
court
has
held
that
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
free
of
state
regulation
may
survive
the
language
of
cession
where
all
right,
title,
and
interest
is
conveyed.
it
held
that
in
the
winans
case
in
1905,
and
this
court's
decision
in
the
antoine
case
in
1975
also
held
that
such
rights
survived
the
all
right,
title,
and
interest
cession
language.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
no,
your
honor.
this
court
has
held
that
the
rights
do
survive
the
total
disestablishment
of
the
reservation.
well,
if
i
understand...
let
me
regroup
here.
your
honor's
question
was,
may
they
survive
total
disestablishment
of
the
reservation
and
the
cede,
sell,
convey,
and
relinquish?
mr.
don
brantley
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
well,
the
winans
decision
certainly
represents
such
a
case.
antoine,
the
court's
1975
decision
in
antoine--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--that's
correct.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
that's
correct.
and
antoine
was
construction
of
a
cession
agreement
that
also
contained...
so
there
is...
there
is
no
case,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
evasive,
there
is
no
case
without
some
sort
of
specific
preservation.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
i
hate
to
speculate,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
court
has
held
that
such
rights,
particularly
the
treaty
right
to
hunt
and
fish
free
of
state
regulation,
that
particular
right,
free
of
state
regulation,
has
survived
the
total
diminishment
of
reservation
status,
and
that
was
this
court's
holding
in
the
1968
menominee
decision.
we
believe
that
those
principles
control...
in
those
cases,
control
the
resolution
of
this
case.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
no,
i--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
may
be
misunderstanding
the
question,
but
my
understanding
of
the
menominee
case
is
that
at
the
time
of
termination,
the
termination
acts
specifically
provided
that
the
reservation,
all
federal
laws
would
no
longer
apply
to
the
reservation.
its
indian
country
status
was
totally
disestablished
and
diminished.
and
there
was
a
specific
provision
in
the
termination
act
that
required
that
all
laws
of
the
states
would
apply
to
the
indians
in
the
same
manner.
but
it
said
nothing
about
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
that's
correct.
and
i
might
address
that
issue
at
this
time.
we
do
not
believe
that
these
rights
are
tied
irrevocably
to
the
land,
so
that
they
shrink
along
with
the
land.
these
rights
were
defined
by
an
area
of
land,
as
necessarily
they
must
have
been,
but
they
were
the
right,
a
very
separate
right
to
hunt
and
fish
over
these
areas,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
be
tied
irrevocably
to
the
tribe's
right
to
occupy
and
possess
those
lands.
and
indeed
the
numerous
cessions
where
tribal
rights
have
been
retained
is
reflective
of
the
fact
that
these
rights
are
not
unequivocally
tied
to
possession
of
the
land.
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
focus
on
the
unique
purposes
of
this
cession
act.
they
distinguish
this
cession
act
from
virtually
every
other
land
cession
act,
with
the
exception
of
the
blackfeet
cession
act
which
i
alluded
to
earlier,
in
that
these
lands
were
not
opened
for
settlement
by
non-indians,
and
the
purpose
of
this
act
was
to
honor
treaty
obligations
in
a
manner
entirely
consistent
with
the
treaty,
and
to
benefit
the
indians.
it
sought
to
promote
their
self-sufficiency.
and
when
you
consider
what
must
have
been
the
indians'
understanding
at
that
time,
here
they
were
negotiating
an
agreement.
the
government
knew
full
well
that
these
lands
were
important
to
them
for
hunting
and
fishing
purposes.
they
had
specifically
bargained
for
their
inclusion
earlier.
and
yet
the
agreement
said
nothing
whatsoever
about
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
but
it
did
contain
an
article,
article
4,
which
provided
that
all
treaty
rights
that
were
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
cession
would
be
preserved.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
well,
we
don't
know,
your
honor,
and
the
record
doesn't
reflect
very
much.
what
it
does
indicate
is
that
there
are
some
statements
by
bureau
of
indian
affairs
people
even
back
in
the
1880s,
15
years
before
the
land
was
going...
or
before
the
boundary
commission
was
even
appointed
to
investigate,
there
was
indication
that
they
simply
thought
that
the
easiest
way
out
of
this
mess
was
to
just
have
congress
buy
it,
and
everything
seemed
to
proceed
down
that
track.
and
one
of
the
important
things
to
keep
in
mind,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
cession
agreement
is
that...
and
with
regard
to
your
inference
that
the
indians
perhaps
didn't
think
it
was
important
is
that
this
was
really...
the
agreement
that
was
negotiated
in
1901
was
really
not
a
negotiated
agreement
across
the
board.
all
items
weren't
on
the
table.
the
inspector
had
told
the
indians
that
he
was
adopting
the
boundary
commission's
detailed
appraisal
of
those
lands,
and
that
the
only
negotiations
they
were
going
to
have
regarded
what
the
indians
were
going
to
do
with
the
proceeds.
so,
there
were
no
negotiations
whatsoever
with
regard
to
whether
the
land
would
be
ceded
or
retained.
the
tribe
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
or
how
much
money
they
would
be
paid
for
the
land.
that
was
preordained.
it
was
simply--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
first
a
matter
that
was
brought
up
earlier
regarding
the
question
of
whether
the
indians
were
paid
for
the
value
of
this
right
or
whether
it
was
subsumed
within
the
fair
market
value
and
highest
and
best
use.
and
i
would
simply
point
to
the
joint
appendix
at
page
14,
stipulation
number
19,
where
the
state
has
stipulated
that
the
commission
did
not
take
the
tribe's
hunting
and
fishing
rights
into
consideration
in
making
its
assessment.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
well,
the
key
is
all
rights
or--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
now,
the
state
has
argued
that
this
is
an
anomalous,
very
different,
almost
an
oddball
right,
that
this
would
be
the
only
place
where
it
would
exist.
the
point
to
be
made
is
that
this
is
a
right,
the
right
that
we
assert
today
is
a
right
that
was
subsumed
within
the
larger
rights
that
the
indians
before
possessed.
it
is
the
same
identical
right
that
exists
today
on
the
other
two-thirds
of
their
treaty
reservation,
and
it
is
a
right
that
exists
on
numerous
other
national
forest
lands
throughout
the
country.
it
has
been
recognized
time
and
again
by
various
courts
in
the
country.
the
thing
that
is
different
about
this
case
is
not
the
nature
of
the
right
asserted.
the
thing
that
is
different
is
the
manner
in
which
the
right
was
preserved,
and
article
4,
which
we
place
great
reliance
on,
means
that
the
rights
were
only
extinguished
to
the
extent
necessary
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
cession,
and
the
purposes
of
this
cession
were
not
to
open
reservation
lands
to
settlement,
as
was
the
case
in
virtually
every
other
cession
act.
so,
the
retention
of
these
rights
on
unfenced,
unenclosed
forest
lands
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
cession,
and
the
indians
surely
must
have
understood
that.
they
knew
that
article
4
was
in
that
agreement,
and
they
knew
that
those
lands
out
there
were
not
going
to
be
settled,
that
they
were
unenclosed,
unfenced
forest
lands,
that
there
was
no
population
pressure.
the
exclusive
nature
of
the
right
was
probably
unimportant
to
them
at
the
time.
nobody
else
used
those
lands
anyway.
the
important
thing
at
the
time
was
the
right
to
be
able
to
go
out
and
continue
to
use
those
lands
for
their
subsistence,
and
that
is
the
way
they
would
have
understood
it,
we
submit.
now,
the
adoption
of
the
approach
for
which
we
have
argued
would
simply
mean
that
in
each
indian
land
cession
act
you
would
have
to
examine
each
act
in
light
of
its
own
legislative
history
and
its
surrounding
circumstances,
and
in
adopting
the
rule
that
we
propose,
the
court
should
bear
in
mind
that
there
really
were
very
few
cessions
and
diminishments
that
were
effectuated
for
purposes
other
than
opening
the
lands
for
settlement,
and
that
is
the
key
to
the
analysis
of
this
case.
this
was
a
unique
act.
its
purpose
was
to
settle
a
boundary
dispute,
honor
treaty
obligations.
its
purpose
was
not
to
benefit
non-indian
settlers.
now,
as
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
it
might
well
be
in
those
cases
where
there
was
a
diminishment
as
well
as
a
cession
of
title
and
the
lands
were
opened
for
settlement,
in
those
cases,
there
might
well
be
an
extinguishment
of
the
rights.
the
totality
of
those
circumstances
might
well
rise
to
the
level
of
clarity
that
has
been
required
by
this
court
for
an
extinguishment
of
the
treaty
rights.
thank
you.
