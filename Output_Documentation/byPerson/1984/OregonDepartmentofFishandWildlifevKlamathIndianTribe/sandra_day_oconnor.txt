justice
o'connor
mr.
frohnmayer,
do
you
agree
that
tribal
hunting
and
fishing
rights
can
exist
outside
of
reservation
lands?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it
possible
that
the
1864
treaty
can
be
read
to
preserve
the
tribe's
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
land
that
was
at
that
time
included
in
the
reservation?
justice
o'connor
well,
can
you
read
that
1864
treaty
as
creating
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
whatever
land
was
in
the
reservation
at
that
time
but
not
that
it
is
forever
bound
to
that
land.
it
could
exist
separate
and
apart
from
it.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
better
reading
of
the
treaty
language
then
is
to
tie
it
irrevocably
to
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation?
justice
o'connor
mr.
frohnmayer,
is
there
anything
to
establish
whether
that
claims
commission
considered
the
value
of
the
tribal
hunting
and
fishing
rights
when
it
made
its
award?
