justice
white
could
i
ask
you
about
that?
when
mills
made
their
grant
or
their...
he
gave
permission
to
create
this
derivative
work...
what
did
the
user
promise
to
do?
pay
royalties...
to
whom?
justice
white
to
whom.
justice
white
and
then
mills
passed
on
half?
justice
white
well,
what
excuses
the
user
from
paying
royalties
to
mills?
justice
white
the
statute
says
that
the
derivative
users
can
continue
to
use,
but
i
suppose
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
their
undertaking.
and
the
statute
may
contemplate
that
what
would
be
continued
for
old
uses
are
those
very
terms,
which
would
include
paying
the
royalty
to
mills.
justice
white
or
mills's
agent.
justice
white
what
kind
of
a
piece
of
paper
passed
between
mills
and
the
user,
the
derivative...
the
record--
justice
white
--all
right.
and
where
is
that?
is
that
piece
of
paper--
justice
white
--promises
to
pay
royalties
to
us.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
this
promise
seems
to
me
to
be
part
of
the
conditions
of
the
use
that
the
statute
says
would
be
continued.
justice
white
if
they
want
to
use
the
work.
justice
white
i
mean,
it
may
be
they
are
not
obligated
to
pay.
they
could
say,
well,
i
don't
want
to
use
it
at
all.
justice
white
but
the
copyright
is
extended
and
gives
the
right
to
exclusive
use,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
the
statute
itself
says
that
the
derivative
work
can
only
continue
to
be
utilized
under
the
terms
of
the
grant.
justice
white
now,
what
grant
is
that?
justice
white
and
the
terms
of
the
grant
are
that
the
grantee
can
license,
and
he
does
license.
justice
white
it
has
to
continue,
but
only
on
the
terms
of
the
grant.
justice
white
that's
right.
and
that
means
that
the
user
has
to
pay.
justice
white
i
suppose
you
could
argue
that
the
terms
of
the
license
are,
by
implication,
made
part
of
the
terms
of
the
original
grant,
because
mills
was
authorized
to
issue
these
licenses.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
would
think
it
would
be...
i
don't
know
why
it
would
hurt
you.
justice
white
in
order
to
get
any
money.
justice
white
you'd
demur
to
the
accusation.
justice
white
and
if
they
had
to
renegotiate
it,
the
price
might
be
higher.
