mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
has
a
similar
superficial
sound
to
the
one
preceding
it.
this,
too,
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
and
here
again,
the
petitioner,
mills
music,
is
arguing
among
other
things,
that
the
court
of
appeals
reversing
the
district
court
violated
the
rule
that
it
ought
to
read
the
statute
and
follow
the
plain
meaning
of
what
congress
wrote.
the
statute
here
is
determination
of
transfer
provisions
of
the
copyright
act
of
1976
and,
more
specifically,
the
one
sentence
exception
to
the
results
of
termination.
the
provisions
that
are
in
issue
are
set
out
at
pages
14
and
15
petitioner's
blue
brief,
and
i'll
be
talking
about
them
and
focusing
most
particularly,
as
i
say,
on
a
single
sentence,
the
exception
that
both
lower
courts
describe
with
a
capital
e
to
focus
on
its
centrality
in
the
case,
which
is
subsection
a
of
304(c)(6)
there
on
page
15
of
our
brief.
very
briefly,
1
time
remind
the
court
of
the
relevant
statutory
background.
the
copyright
act
of
1976,
extending
copyright
terms
in
general
to
75
years
for
old
copyrights,
that
is,
pre-act
copyrights,
and
to
life
of
the
author
plus
50
years
for
new
copyrights,
also
created
a
termination
provision
by
which
authors
or
their
heirs
could
terminate
grants
of
transfers
or
licenses
of
their
copyrights.
there
are
two
separate
sections
that
embody
this
termination
idea.
one,
section
203,
relates
to
new
copyrights
after
the
effective
date
of
the
new
act.
the
other,
section
304,
relates
to
preexisting
copyrights.
we
deal
with
304
here,
but
as
the
courts
below
indicated,
and
i
think
the
parties
agree,
both
sections
are
identical
for
our
purposes.
both
contain
the
identical
exception
for
derivative
works
set
out
at
page
15
of
our
brief.
and
it
is
that
exception
that
the
case
is
about,
and
i'll
be
talking
about
that
sentence,
i
think,
in
some
little
detail.
the
undisputed
facts
that
led
to
the
summary
judgment
motions
and
decision
in
the
district
court
are
relatively
simple.
in
1923,
three
authors,
including
ted
snyder,
wrote
a
song,
a
popular
song
called
"who's
sorry
now"?
we're
concerned
only
with
ted
snyder's
interest
and
the
interest
of
his
heirs,
marie
snyder
and
ted
snyder,
jr.,
and
i'll
be
referring
to
him,
as
we
have
throughout,
as
the
author.
in
1940,
snyder
assigned
the
renewal
term
of
his
copyright
to
the
mills
music
company,
the
petitioner
here,
in
a
form
of
assignment
that,
as
both
courts
below
said,
is
typical
of
the
music
business
and
typical
of
a
number
of
others.
and
it
appears
at
the
beginning
of
page
41
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
provisions
of
direct
and
central
interest
to
us
are
the
provisions
for
the
licensing
by
mills
of
recordings
of
the
song.
snyder,
in
a
sense,
did
not
transfer
all
his
rights
under
the
copyright,
and
i
mean
in
the
sense
that
be
retained
under
the
terms
of
his
graft
a
50
percent
interest
in
the
net
royalties
from
licenses
for
recordings
that
mills
was
authorized
to
issue.
now,
that,
as
both
courts
below
said,
is
a
standard
or
typical
arrangement
in
the
music
business.
and
its
standardness
and
typicality
is
a
point
of
some
consequence,
in
our
view,
for
the
correct
construction
of
the
statute.
and
i
might
add,
as
the
court
of
appeals
indicated,
that
multi-grant
situations
of
the
kind
we
have
here
are
typical
net
only
in
the
music
business,
but
in
other
fields
of
artistic
work
and
the
business
relationships
that
grow
up
around
artistic
works,
and
that
is,
among
other
reasons
we
take
it,
why
this
is
a
case
warranting
review
on
certiorari.
after
the
effective
date
of
the
new
act,
the
heirs
of
ted
snyder,
whose
widow
and
his
son,
who
is
a
conservator
of
the
widow,
exercised
the
power
given
under
that
statute
3o4(c)
to
terminate
the
graft,
terminate
the
grant
from
ted
snyder
to
mills.
they
exercised
it
by
giving
a
notice
to
mills
referring
to
that
grant
and
terminated
it.
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
that's
the
only
grant
they
purported
to
terminate
and,
for
our
purposes,
the
only
grant
they
could
terminate.
everyone
agrees
that
as
a
result
of
the
termination,
they
recapture
100
percent
of
all
rights
in
the
copyright
going
forward
from
the
effective
date
of
the
termination.
they
can
license
new
recordings.
they
can
reap
rewards
from
sheet
music.
they
can
use
it
in
movies
and
wherever
else
popular
songs
are
exploited.
and
this
appears
to
be
still
a
popular
song
that
produces
considerable
royalties.
there
is,
as
i've
said,
an
exception
to
what
reverts
to
them,
and
that's
what
the
case
is
about.
that
exception,
the
exception
for
derivative
works,
relates
to
sound
recordings,
in
our
case,
a
form
of
derivative
work
licensed
by
mills
prior
to
the
termination.
prior
to
the
termination,
as
i've
said,
the
net
royalties
were
shared
equally,
50/50
under
the
standard
practice
in
the
industry.
mills's
position
is
that
under
the
plain
words
of
that
statute
which
mills
contends
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
when
it
wrote
it,
under
those
plain
words,
mills
contends
that
congress,
for
those
old
derivative
works,
issued
under
the
authority
of
mills,
the
old
arrangement
of
equal
sharing
continues.
the
position
of
the
snyders
is
that
that's
not
so,
and
that
the
snyders
now
get
100
percent
of
those
royalties.
their
position
was
rejected
by
judge
weinfeld
in
the
district
court.
judge
weinfeld
said
the
position
is
one
that
requires
a
tortured
reading
of
that
exception.
but
judge
weinfeld
characteristically
did
not
stop
with
the
language.
he
went
ahead
and
wrote
what
the
circuit
properly
called
a
characteristically
comprehensive
opinion,
traced
through
the
history,
traced
through
the
policies
and
the
purposes
of
congress
in
this
enactment,
and
concluded
that,
if
anything,
that
history
buttressed
what
the
plain
language
said,
certainly
did
not
warrant
altering
it
or
deviating
from
it.
the
circuit,
as
i
say,
reversed
and
reversed...
and
i'll
be
returning
to
this...
on
the
basic
premise,
as
stated
by
the
circuit...
that
congress
did
not
realize
what
it
was
legislating
about
when
it
legislated
for
the
exception,
was
not
aware
of
or
did
not
have
in
mind
the
standard
or
typical
or
common
multiple
grant
situation.
and
our
position
on
that,
which
i
will
enlarge
upon
is,
that
you're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
was
20
years
in
the
making,
that
the
circuit
emphasizes
correctly
was
initially
produced
after
long
study
by
the
copyright
office,
and
you
have
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that,
throughout
the
20
years
of
that
gestation,
the
copyright
office
which
lives
with
copyrights
and
the
business
relationships
every
day
in
the
week,
didn't
realize
that
this
exception
would
be
treating
that
standard
or
typical
arrangement,
and
that
congress...
which
was
at
this
for
ten
years...
didn't
realize
it
either.
we
say
with
respect
to
the
circuit
that
that's
a
drastically
wrong
way
to
view
the
work
of
congress
and
to
interpret
a
statute.
we
say
it
is
contrary
to
what
the
court
would
presume
if
it
had
no
evidence
of
anything
about
what
congress
knew
or
didn't
know.
this
court
has
said
more
than
once
that
if
you
have
nothing
else
to
go
on,
a
judge
ought
to
presume
that
the
congress
knows
what
it's
dealing
with
when
it
legislates,
knows
what's
out
there
in
the
world
that
will
affected
by
the
statute.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
third
parties,
but
it
is
dealing
with
a
world
where
grants
and
subgrants
are
the
order
of
that
universe.
it
covers
that
universe--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--let
me
come
to
that
directly,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
that
exception,
it
says
"a
derivative
work,
prepared
under
authority
of
the
grant
before
its
termination,
may
continue
to
be
utilized
under
the
terms
of
the
grant
after
its
termination.
"
"but
this
privilege
does
not
extend
to
new
derivative
works.
"
and
we
all
agree
on
that.
now,
first,
there's
a
matter
of--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--is
mills
music
a--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--no,
it
is
not.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
is
not,
your
honor.
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
utilizers,
and
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
preparers.
what
it
is
says
is,
"the
derivative
work,
prepared
under
authority
of
the
grant
before
its
termination.
"
let's
be
clear.
the
only
grant
that
was
terminated
is
the
grant
from
snyder
to
mills.
that's
the
only
grant
they
could
terminate.
now,
the
only
thing
that
the
exception
applies
to
or
could
apply
to
is
a
derivative
work
prepared
under
authority
of
that
grant,
because
obviously
the
exception
is
referring
to
that.
if
you're
dealing
with
a
derivative
work
that
was
not
prepared
under
the
authority
of
that
grant,
but
some
other
grant,
it
doesn't
get
into
the
exception
at
all.
the
exception
only
applies
to
that
situation.
now,
our
friends
say
obviously
what
congress
wanted
to
protect
in
this
case
are
the
419
licensees
authorized
by
mills
to
make
recordings.
if
the
concern
is
to
protect
them...
and
we
agree
it
is...
the
only
way
they
get
protected
is
by
virtue
of
this
exception.
and
while
the
exception
does
not
say
in
so
many
words,
this
applies
to
the
typical
arrangement
and
the
judges
are
to
read
it
faithfully
and
understand
what
it
means,
and
assume
congress
knew
what
it
was
talking
about,
and
see
how
it
works...
while
it
doesn't
say
that,
it
fits
with
great
comfort
and
intelligibility,
as
judge
weinfeld
held,
if
somebody's
looking
at
it
with
a
purpose
to
serve
the
mandate
of
congress,
which
we
think
is
the
judicial
purpose.
one
way
to
illustrate
that,
your
honor,
is
to
look
at
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
it
said
this
exception
is
ambiguous.
"ambiguous"
means
having
more
than
one
meaning.
if
you
read
the
exception,
it's
not
ambiguous.
it
refers
to
just
one
grant...
the
terminated
grant.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
sure.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
on
the
latter
half,
with
respect,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
i
would
say
it
somewhat
differently.
it
does
address
that,
because
it
would
have
been
written
differently
if
it
didn't.
it
only
had
to
say
derivative
works
are
protected
and
derivative
works
owners
will
not
be
infringers,
period,
if
it
only
wanted
to
protect
them.
either
way,
we
are
absolutely
agreed
that
they
were
the
object
of
congress's
concern
and
solicitude.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
and
you
will
note
that
there
isn't
any
derivative
work
owner
here.
they
pay
their
royalties
and
have
been
paying
them
under
this
new
statute,
and
they
don't
have
any
question
about
that.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
user
promised
to
pay
royalties.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
to
mills.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
mills
passed
on
half
of
the
net
royalties
to
the
snyders.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
actually,
your
honor,
the
mechanics,
the
user...
i'm
not
sure
this
is
at
the
heart
of
your
question,
but
i
want
to
be
technically
accurate.
as
a
matter
of
mechanics,
the
royalties
are
paid
to
this
harry
fox
agency,
the
licensee
of
a
lot
of
publishers,
that
handles
the
mechanics
of
these
licenses.
it
deducts
its
administrative
costs,
and
then
the
net
royalties
go
50/50
to
mills
and
the
snyders.
the
record
owners,
if
i
may
now
try
to
reach
the
question,
have
not
been
excused.
they
have
not
stopped
paying.
they
continue
to
pay.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
to
mills
if--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
grant
that
has
been
terminated,
you
will
see
that
there's
no
way
to
know
that
rca,
for
example,
is
a
record
company
authorized
to
make
derivative
works.
you
will
also
find
no
way
to
know
from
the
grant
what
was
the
specific
royalty
rate
that
rca
has
to
pay
under
the
license
from
mills.
what
the
grant
from
snyder
to
mills
says
in
that
many
words
is,
lock,
follow
the
typical
arrangement,
licensed
record
companies...
rca,
columbia,
whoever...
and,
of
course,
fill
in
the
royalty
rate.
but
the
grant
is
the
overarching
limiter--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--actually,
again,
i'm
being
pedantic,
but
i
want
to
be
accurate,
the
piece
of
paper
passed
from
harry
fox
to--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--yes.
a
couple
of
them
begin
at
page
22
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
i
mentioned
rca
because
it
is
the
illustrative
company.
and
there,
in
this
subgrant
or
sub-license,
mills,
through
its
agent
harry
fox,
fills
in
the
blanks.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
us
being
harry
fox.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
and
harry
fox
being
an
agent
of
mills.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
and
this
being
the
typical
industry
arrangement.
and
i
emphasize,
your
honor,
if--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--without
a
doubt.
without
a
doubt,
your
honor.
but
it
will
only
be
allowed
to
be
continued
if
it
was
a
use
permitted
by
the
terms
of
the
terminated
grant.
and
that's
why
we
way
what
you
have
to
look
to
to
find
out
how
that
use
is
regulated
and
administered,
what
you
have
to
look
to
is
the
terms
of
the
terminated
grant.
now,
that,
we
argue
as
a
matter
of
english,
logic,
syntax.
now,
it
is
true,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
words,
if
you
have
something
less
than
a
will
to
make
them
work,
can
be
made
not
to
work.
and
if
you
look
at
the
alternatives
which
were
conveniently,
from
our
view,
laid
out
by
the
court
of
appeals,
you
can
see
a
contrast
between
these
possible
approaches.
at
page
23
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
out
what
the
circuit
acknowledges
is
the
way
the
words
of
that
exception,
subsection
a,
would
have
to
be
rewritten
if
congress
had
expressly
intended
to
reach
the
result
that
the
circuit
thought
it
ought
to
reach.
and
what
you
find
there
in
the
text
at
page
23
is
a
wonderfully,
thoroughly,
entirely
rewritten
statute
full
of
italics,
twice
as
much
new
language
added
by
the
circuit
in
its
drafting
effort
as
the
language
congress
wrote.
if
you
go
to
the
next
page,
in
footnote
10,
you
will
see
what
the
circuit
did
in
its
evenhandedness.
it
said
well,
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
and
we
would
have
to
rewrite
it
in
order
for
mills
to
win
as
well.
and
in
that
footnote,
you'll
see
the
rewriting
and
you'll
see
a
few
italicized
words.
and
i
think
your
honors
will
see,
with
all
respect
to
the
distinguished
circuit,
that
it's
a
bad
drafting
job;
that
these
words
are
added,
most
of
them,
gratuitously.
they
don't
make
a
better
statute.
they
aren't
necessary.
a
court
bent
as
the
district
court,
we
submit,
in
this
case
was,
on
reading
faithfully
the
message
congress
tried
to
convey,
in
the
context
of
the
world
with
respect
to
which
congress
was
legislating,
would
reach
the
district
court's
result,
we
say,
as
a
matter
of
the
essentially
adequately
plain
meaning
of
this
statute
in
its
setting.
we
say
that
on
the
plain
meaning
rule,
there
just
isn't
any
way
to
reach
the
circuit's
result.
and
let
me
point
out--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--yes,
your--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
the
extension
affected
everybody.
now,
if
it
were
not
for
the
extension,
the
snyder
copyright
would
by
now
have
expired.
and
the
record
companies
for
whom
our
friends
are
solicitors
and
we
are,
too,
would
be
able
to
sell
their
records
without
paying
royalties
to
anyone.
it's
agreed
that
by
virtue
of
the
extension,
they
do
have
to
continue
paying
royalties.
when
the
deal
was
made
between
snyder
and
mills,
both
of
them
expected
a
maximum
of
56
years,
snyder
as
well
as
mills.
congress
came
along
and
extended
the
copyright,
and
then
the
question
was
what
does
snyder
or
his
heirs
get,
and
what
does
everyone
else
get?
now,
congress
said
we're
going
to
give
the
author,
because
we
have
special
concern
for
authors,
100
percent
of
everything,
with
an
exception.
now,
what's
the
exception?
the
exception
says
whatever
were
the
terms
on
which
old
derivative
works
were
launched
into
the
world,
we're
going
to
continue
that.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
with
respect
to
old
derivative
works,
the
short
answer
is
no.
and
it
was
intended
to
be
no.
they
used
the
example
of
movies,
for
instance.
in
many
movie
deals,
an
author
sells
the
movie
rights
to
his
or
her
book
outright,
and
people
make
movies
based
upon
it.
under
this
statute,
those
movies
could
continue
to
be
exhibited,
and
the
original
author
would
get
nothing.
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
an
effort
to
make
a
different
result.
it
failed.
whatever
the
old
deal
was,
having
in
mind
that
congress
didn't
know
who
did
what
to
whom
with
respect
to
old
derivative
works,
congress
knew...
and
it's
in
the
legislative
record,
as
the
courts
below
knew...
that
publishers
are
not
mere
middle
men,
that
authors
don't
just
give
their
copyrights
to
publishers
out
of
a
feckless
love
for
these
companies
so
that
they
can
collect
money.
but
they
give
those
rights
to
publishers
because
publishers
promote,
plug,
sell
the
work.
and
congress
knew
that,
the
copyright
office
knew
that,
and
they
legislated
accordingly.
and
congress
said
the
author
gets
everything,
going
forward.
but
for
what
was
done
in
the
past,
we're
going
to
leave
the
parties
as
they
agreed
to
be.
if
it
was
a
lump
sum,
it's
finished.
if
it's
shared,
you
go
under
those
terms.
now,
look
at
what
the
circuit
said.
and
then
i'll
stop,
if
i
may.
the
circuit
said
you
have
to
read
that
subsection
a
to
mean
that
the
word
419
grants
from
mills
to
the
record
companies,
not
the
terminated
grant.
so
that,
as
a
result
of
the
circuit's
reading,
you
somehow
don't
get
into
this
exception
at
all,
and
what
that
is
is
a
way
of...
as
we
put
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
correctly...
i
think
it's
a
legitimate
lawyer's
argument.
what
that's
saying
is
that
in
the
same
section
of
the
same
statute,
when
it
used
the
word
"grant",
congress
used
it
to
have
two
different
meanings.
it
doesn't
work
as
a
matter
of
grammar.
it
doesn't
work
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
it
is
completely
wrong
as
a
matter
of
history
and
policy
in
our
submission.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
they
are
obliged
by
the
license
that
they
accepted
from
mills--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--it
did.
but
all
have
thus
far
agreed...
and
it
may
be
in
part...
it
may
be
in
part,
your
honor,
because
there's
no
record
company
here.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
know
you're
aware
of
that.
we
are
agreed
that
the
record
companies,
having
construed
all
the
pertinent
documents,
statutory
and
contractual,
are
right
in
their
decision
that
they
have
to
keep
paying
royalties.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
the
source
of
their
obligation
is
their
acceptance
of
the
license
which
would
subsist
as
long
as
there
was
a
valid
copyright
under
gerde.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
the
copyright,
the
grant
which
is
the
main
document,
has
remained
effective
because
congress
said
it
would
remain
effective,
and
that
you
look
to
the
terms
of
that
terminated
grant,
continued
in
force,
as
the
conditions
on
which
these
record
companies
could
continue
to
utilize.
it
didn't
ask
who
is
the
utilizer.
it
said
whoever
is
utilizing
does
it
under
the
terms
of
the
terminated
grant.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
not
so
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
and
i
think--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--it
may
be,
your
honor,
and
i'm
sure
that
both
mr.
tyler
and
i
would
be
grievously
unhappy
if
the
court
found
a
way
to
reach
that
question
on
this
record.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way
to
reach
that
question,
your
honor,
because
everybody
has
assumed,
including
the
people
who
care...
the
record
companies...
that
they
have
to
pay.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
they
want
to
continue
to
sell
records.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
terms
of
payment
are
only
a
royalty.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
it's
only
a
royalty
arrangement
anyhow.
if
they
don't
sell
any
records,
they
don't
pay
anything.
but
it's
a
royalty-based
arrangement,
and
i
think,
though
frankly
i'm
not
prepared
to
argue
all
the
details
of
this,
knowing
something
about
the
copyright
bar
and
entertainment
lawyers,
if
that
were
wrong,
justice
o'connor,
for
the
record
companies
to
have
decided
they
don't
have
to
pay,
we'd
have
heard
from
them
before
now.
but
so
far,
so
far
as
i
know,
subject
to
what
my
friend
knows,
that
contention
has
not
been
raised,
certainly
not
in
court.
thank
you.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
the
court
please,
starting
at
the
end
of
mr.
tyler's
presentation,
of
course
we
argue
that
the
termination
provision
and
the
exception
in
the
statute
refers
to
only
one
grant,
the
terminated
grant.
of
course,
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
subgrant
or
license
contemplated
in
the
world
that
these
people
lived
in
by
the
grant
from
snyder
to
mills.
in
addition,
we
not
only
acknowledge
but
insist
that
in
the
world
congress
addressed
in
this
statute,
multiple
grants
are
the
typical
standard
arrangement;
not
just
two,
but
three,
four,
five,
six,
to
financiers
from
creative
people
to
financiers,
to
distributors,
to
exhibitors,
et
cetera.
and
when
congress
wrote
this
exception
to
provide
that
the
derivative
works
may
be
utilized
under
the
terms
of
the
grant,
the
terminated
grant,
what
it
was
saying
is,
we
can't
visualize
all
the
arrangements
out
there.
what
we
are
doing
for
former
derivative
works
is
simply
maintaining
the
status
quo.
that's
the
fairest
arrangement
we
can
make.
if
the
artist
gave
up
the
derivative
work
right
for
a
lump
sum
in
the
past,
the
artist
gets
nothing.
the
status
quo
holds.
if
the
artist
gave
it
up
on
the
basis
of
50/50
or
90/10,
that
holds
under
the
terms
of
the
terminated
grant.
i
think
that's
what
we
mean.
now,
i
want
to
answer
a
question
that
i
think
came
from
both
justice
o'connor
and
justice
stevens.
are
we
fighting
about
an
academic
subject?
if
we
weren't
here,
and
if
the
copyright
had
been
extended
as
it
had,
derivative
work
owners
would
be
infringing
that
copyright
by
surveying
their
derivative
works
unless
they
had
authorization.
so
i'm
quite
sure
that
although
my
answer
was
inadequate
before
lunch,
the
reason
they're
happy
to
go
along
is
that
they
need
the
license
in
order
to
be
selling
their
records.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
might
indeed.
i
understand
the
song
was
on
television
this
morning.
[laughter]
