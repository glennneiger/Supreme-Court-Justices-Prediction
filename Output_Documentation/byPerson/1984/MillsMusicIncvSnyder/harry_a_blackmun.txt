justice
blackmun
judge
tyler,
why
do
you
think
judge
weinfeld
didn't
buy
that
argument?
justice
blackmun
judge
tyler,
i
think
i
should
object
that
you
and
judge
frankel
speak
of
how
long
ago
this
took
place,
in
1923
i
think.
that
is
long
ago
for
both
of
you,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
us
up
here
who
remember
when
who's
sorry
now
came
out,
and
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
song.
