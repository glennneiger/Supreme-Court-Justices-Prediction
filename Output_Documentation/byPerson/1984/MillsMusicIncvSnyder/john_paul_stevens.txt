justice
stevens
can
i
just
ask
one
question,
mr.
frankel?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
source,
as
you
understand
the
statute,
of
the
obligation
of
the
419
licenses
to
continue
to
pay
anything
to
mills
or
fox?
justice
stevens
which,
at
the
time
they
accepted
it,
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out,
anticipated
there
would
be
no
payments
after
the
56th
year.
justice
stevens
that's
what's
running
through
my
mind.
justice
stevens
and
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
source
of
their
obligation
to
continue
to
pay?
justice
stevens
but
under
your
theory,
there
is
no
valid
copyright
insofar
as
it
covers
the
exclusive
right
to
use
the
derivative
works.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
tylcer--
justice
stevens
--mr
tyler,
isn't
it
correct
that
it's
subject
to
an
exception
for
the
derivative
works?
that
the
people
who
make
the
derivative
works
may
continue
to
make
them.
justice
stevens
so
that
the
copyright
owner
has
no
exclusive
right
to
prevent
them
from--
justice
stevens
--so
i
don't
understand
your...
supposing
the
derivative
works
people
had
paid
a
lump
sum
for
their
rights,
anticipating
that
they
would
run
out
in
56
years.
they
wouldn't
have
to
pay
anymore.
justice
stevens
no.
my
question
is,
your
client
did
exactly
what
he
did
with
mills,
and
then
mills
said
well,
i'll
give
rca
the
right
to
use
this
particular
song
for
$5,000,
and
they
paid
it
in
cash
on
the
table.
then
they
could
continue
to
use
it
after
the
expiration.
justice
stevens
and
the
reason
they
could
do
it
is
because
your
client
has
no
exclusive
privilege
with
respect
to
the
derivative
work.
justice
stevens
then
what
is
the
source
of
your
right
to
royalties
with
respect
to
derivative
works?
justice
stevens
well,
my
question
is,
what
is
the
source
of
your
right
to
get
any
money
at
all
from
rca?
justice
stevens
but
your
answer
to
my
question,
then...
i
asked
you
what
is
the
source
of
snyder's
right
to
receive
royalties
from
rca.
and
as
i
understand
your
answer,
it
is
the
document
on
ja-22
which
says
in
words,
rca
must
pay
royalties
to
mills.
that's
your
argument.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
it's
a
written
undertaking
by
rca
to
pay
money
to
mills,
which
is
what
you
claim
to
be
the
source
of
snyder's
right
to
receive
money
from
rca.
justice
stevens
well,
of
course
not.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
does
that
mean
you
still
rely
on
the
grants
from
mills
to
rca
as
the
source
of
rca's
obligation
to
pay
money
to--
justice
stevens
--i
understand.
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
just
kind
of
simplify.
it
seems
to
me
you
can
rely
on
either
the
statute
or
the
written
grant
or
a
combination
of
the
two.
justice
stevens
but
is
it
correct
that
having
terminated,
that
the
statute
does
not
give
your
client
any
right
to
exclude
rca
from
further
making
the
derivative
work
that
was--
justice
stevens
--what
is
the
source
of
your
right
to
get
money
from
rca?
justice
stevens
with
respect
to
everything
except
that
derivative
grant.
