justice
o'connor
mr.
frankel,
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
appears
to
be
addressed
just
to
the
single
grant
situation,
author
to
the
person
who
uses
the
work.
it
doesn't,
on
the
face
of
it
at
least,
seem
to
address
the
third
party
situation.
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
our
problem,
of
course,
but
how
to
apply
this
language
which
may
not
be
all
that
clear
as
applied
to
the
third
party
situation?
justice
o'connor
is
mills
music
a
utilizer
under
that
subsection?
justice
o'connor
a
utilizer.
justice
o'connor
does
mills
music
utilize
the
work?
justice
o'connor
except
that
it
appears,
when
you
read
it,
to
be
addressed
to
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
people
who
have
recorded
the
works.
justice
o'connor
and
that
it
doesn't
appear
to
address
the
royalty
question
or
who
should
receive
what
royalties.
justice
o'connor
mr.
frankel,
i
guess
at
the
time
that
snyder
made
the
agreement
originally
with
mills
music,
it
was
contemplated
that,
at
best,
the
right
would
extend
for
28
years
and
a
renewal
term.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
and
we're
now
in
that
extended
19...
we're
talking
about
the
extension
of
an
additional
19
years
within
which
the
copyright
can
be
put
into
effect
beyond
that
contemplated
by
snyder
and
mills
when
it
was
originally
made.
justice
o'connor
and
so
i'm
wondering
whether,
under
those
circumstances,
the
mechanical
licenses
issued
by
mills
would
be
expected
to
continue
to
require
payment
of
royalties
beyond
the
original
expiration
time.
justice
o'connor
well,
if
then
snyder
had
entered
into
the
agreement
with
mills
for
a
fixed
lump
sum
fee,
not
a
continuing
royalty
of
50
percent,
but
just
you
pay
me
$5,000
now
and
you
may
have
the
right
to
license
during
the
term
of
the
copyright,
would
snyder's
heirs
now
be
in
a
position
to
share
in
any
of
the
money?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
frankel,
has
any
court
had
occasion
yet
to
decide
whether,
under
one
of
these
fox-type
agreements,
the
licensees
are
required
to
continue
to
pay
any
royalty
at
all?
justice
o'connor
and
so
that
is
really
an
open
question.
and
if
they
are
not
required
to
pay
any
royalties
at
all,
i
guess
both
you
and
the
respondent
are
losers
in
that
sense.
justice
o'connor
what
page,
please?
what
page
again?
justice
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
o'connor
mr.
tyler,
may
i
inquire,
before
you
sit
down,
the
snyders
in
any
event,
even
if
your
opponent's
view
is
the
correct
one,
could
issue
new
licenses
after
the
termination
and
derive
income
from
new
licenses.
justice
o'connor
at
least
that
i
guess
you
are
in
agreement
on.
now,
what
percent
of
the
income
that
you
would
expect
someone
like
the
snyders
to
get
over
the
19-year
period
of
extension
would
you
reasonably
expect
to
come
from
the
400-and-some
preexisting
derivative
works,
as
opposed
to
new
licenses
that
the
snyders
would
issue?
justice
o'connor
how
great
is
the
problem?
i
mean,
do
the
snyders
really
think
that
all
the
income
is
going
to
come
from
these
preexisting
derivative
works
for
which
mills
issued
the
mechanical
licenses?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
anticipate,
then,
that
you'll
be
issuing...
the
snyders
would
be
issuing
any
new
licenses
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
o'connor
but
your
realistic
expectation
is
what?
that
most
of
the
income
would
probably
be
from
the
preexisting--
justice
o'connor
--well,
i
know
that,
but
i
think
that
the
practical
expectations
might
shed
some
light
on
what
congress
had
in
mind.
