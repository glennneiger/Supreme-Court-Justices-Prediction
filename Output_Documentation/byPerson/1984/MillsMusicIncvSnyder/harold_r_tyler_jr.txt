mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
snyders
contend
that
this
argument,
both
in
the
brief
as
well
as
orally,
on
behalf
of
mills,
really
avoids
and
evades
the
principal
issue
in
this
case.
and
that
is
the
contention
that
the
snyders
made
successfully
in
the
court
below,
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
statutory
language,
whether
it's
in
the
basic
reversion
section
or
the
exception
thereto,
or
any
of
the
purposes
of
congress
in
passing
this
language,
which
can
indicate
that
mills,
as
a
publisher,
is
a
benefitted
class
under
this
legislation.
there
is
just
no
language
in
this
statutory
set
of
provisions
which
deals
with
anyone
in
the
nature
of
mills.
it
is
argued
that
the
language
is
plain.
we
agree
with
that.
we
are
accused,
of
course,
of
saying,
as
is
the
second
circuit
accused
of
saying,
that
the
language
is
ambiguous.
as
far
as
it
goes,
the
language
is
very
clear.
first
of
all,
section
304(c)(6)
says
that
all
of
a
particular
author's
rights
that
were
covered
by
the
termination,
terminated
grant,
revert
to
the
author
or
as,
in
this
case
where
the
author
is
deceased,
to
his
heirs.
second
of
all,
the
derivative
works
exception
is
very
slain
on
its
face.
it
says
a
derivative
work
prepared
under
authority
of
the
grant
before
its
termination
may
continue
to
be
utilized
under
the
terms
of
the
grant
after
its
termination.
now,
contrary
to
mill's
argument,
the
second
circuit
did
not
miss
the
point
here
at
all.
it
flatly
observed
that
the
real
problem
with
the
exception
language
is
that
it
was
designed
to
apply
to
a
one-step
grant
only.
that
is
to
say,
a
grant
by
the
holder
of
the
underlying
copyright
to
someone
who
was
a
creator
of
what
is
known
as
a
derivative
work.
i
recognize
that
mill
dances
evasively
on
what
is
meant
by
a
utilizer
and,
of
course,
points
our
correctly
that
there
is
not
the
exact
word
"utilizer"
in
the
exception,
but
it's
perfectly
clear
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
preserving
the
right,
which
is
a
copyrightable
right,
to
someone
such
as
a
record
company
who
takes
an
assignment
from
someone
in
the
position
of
either
the
original
copyright
owner
or,
as
in
this
case,
mills
and
uses
the
idea
of
the
underlying
song
to
create
what
is
clearly
a
separately
copyrightable
work.
that
is
what
congress
wanted
to
protect,
and
all
that
is
asked
of
this
court
is
to
do
what
courts
from
time-honored
beginnings
have
always
done:
to
apply
the
clear
intent
of
congress
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
now,
it
is
to
be
noticed
also
that
mills
does
not
like
to
talk
about
the
precise
grants
which
are
shown
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
what
happened
was,
as
the
court's
questions
illustrated
now,
originally
snyder
sold
to
mills
the
rights
to
the
second
28
years
in
the
original
old
statutory
setup
of
56
years.
mills
has
gotten
its
full
56
years,
and
it
certainly
was
not
the
intention
of
congress,
we
say,
when
they
added
19
years
in
the
new
statute
to
benefit
authors,
that
there
is
anything
in
the
statutory
language
here
that
gives
one
scintilla
of
a
suggestion,
let
alone
evidence,
that
mills
in
its
position,
having
bargained
for
the
56
years...
and
believe
me,
members
of
this
court,
they
knew
how
to
bargain
to
get
their
value...
when
way
back
in
the
1940s
they
agreed
to
a
price
with
snyder.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i
think
the
short
answer,
justice
blackmum,
is
this.
if
you
will
notice,
in
his
70-plus
page
opinion,
nowhere
did
the
district
court
start
out
or
indeed
anywhere
along
the
line,
focus
on
the
principal
objectives
which
congress
obviously
intended
here;
first,
to
extend
for
authors
a
period
of
copyright
protection,
especially
for
those
authors
such
as
snyder
who,
way
back
in
the
early
20s,
long
before
this
50/50
split
which
my
opponent
says
is
the
norm
of
the
trade,
was
ever
the
norm
of
the
trade,
assigned
away
their
copyright--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--second,
if
you'll
bear
with
me,
justice
rehnquist,
the
clear
purpose
of
the
exception
is
not
to
benefit
a
publisher
like
mills,
but
to
benefit
the
public,
to
give
the
public
access
to
clearly
copyrightable
derivative
works.
now,
if
you
will
notice
in
the
opinion
of
judge
weinfeld,
he
really
never
talks
about
those
two
purposes,
and
i
maintain
that
what
happened
was,
if
you
turn
to
the
core
of
his
holding,
he
misconstrued
really
what
the
interplay
between
these
parts
of
the
statutory
language
were
all
about.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
no,
not
in
this
sense,
justice
rehnquist.
the
whole
purpose
of
this
section
304(c)(6)
initially
was
to
enable
some
author
such
as
snyder,
who
long
ago
had
bargained
away
the
underlying
copyright,
to
get
it
back.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
that
is
correct.
in
other
words,
the
snyders
are
well
aware,
as
they
have
been
in
the
court
below
and
here,
that
subsection
304(c)(6)
is
subject
to
this
privilege
to
derivative
works
utilizers.
to
that
extent
the
reversion
is
somewhat
undercut,
if
you
will,
or
made
subject
to
a
privilege.
but
that
privilege
doesn't
go
to
somebody
like
mills.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
mills
hasn't
created
anything.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
you've
got
to
be
a
little
careful
here.
if
your
question
means,
instead
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
if
our
client
snyder
has
assigned
directly
to
a
derivative
works--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--oh,
there's
no
doubt
of
that,
but
that's
not
going
to
make
it--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--we
have
to
accept
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
that's
a
little
different.
what
we're
saying
is,
we
have
to
concede
that
to
be
consistent
here
under
the
exception,
as
you
point
out.
what
we
are
arguing
is
quite
a
different
case.
mills
is
trying
to
position
itself
as
a
beneficiary
of
the
privilege,
that
is,
the
privilege
conferred
in
the
exception,
which
language
has
nothing
to
do
with
mills
at
all.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
let
me
go
back
to
the
two
grants
here.
first
of
all,
you
will
notice
in
the
record
that
the
first
grant
by
snyder
to
mills
provided
that
mills
got
the
copyright
and
for
the
future
of
that
28-year
second
term,
there
was
an
obligation
specifically
set
forth
in
that
grant
that
mills
would
have
to
remit
to
snyder
50
percent
of
all
income
collected
by
mills.
now,
once
304(c)(6)
was
enacted,
mills
goes
out
of
the
picture.
it's
perfectly
clear.
the
reversion
takes
place.
snyder
steps
in...
excuse
me...
snyder
or
his
heirs
steps
into
the
shoes
of
mills.
that
leaves
us
to
the
second
grant.
in
that
second
grant,
there
is
no
way
my
opponents
can
get
around
it.
they
have
to
rely,
which
they
don't
like
to
do,
obviously,
on
this
second
grant.
and
what
did
the
second
grant
provide?
and
this,
i'm
looking
to
page
22
of
the
joint
appendix.
my
opponent
sort
of
suggests
that
this
is--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--ja-22,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
our
opponents
like
to
sort
of
slither
around
and
say
this
isn't
very
clear
and
it
doesn't
really
indicate
an
awful
lot,
but
it
indicates
one
thing.
mills
music,
under
this
second
grant,
that
is,
the
grant
to
the
derivative
works
utilizer
or
the
record
company,
pays
100
percent
to
mills.
so
that
the
obligation
flowing
from
the
derivative
works
utilizer
or
the
record
companies
should
come
now
to
pay
snyder,
because
snyder
stands
in
the
shoes
of
mills.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
yes;
because
snyder,
under
the
reversion--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--so
long
as
you
understand...
and
i
am
sure
you
do...
that
this
wouldn't
have
ever
come
up
if
it
weren't
for
the
statute
change.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
but
otherwise,
yes.
now--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--well,
i
agree,
both
counts.
it's
a
long
time
for
me.
judge
frankel
claims
to
be
a
little
bit
younger
than
i
am,
but
i
deny
it.
now,
one
of
the
points
here
which
becomes
very
important
in
understanding
what
happened
is
to
recognize,
contrary
to
what
we
understand
mills,
being
prepared
to
argue
not
only
here
but
in
the
court
below,
is
the
legislative
history.
and
as
you
know,
there's
a
great
deal
devoted
in
the
mills
brief
here
and
some
significant
part
by
us,
the
point
being,
as
i
understand
mills,
that
the
legislative
history,
as
they
claim
judge
weinfeld
found,
is
inclusive.
we
dispute
that,
simply
because
if
you
analyze
clearly
what
happened
here,
that
beginning
in
the
late
'50s,
the
copyright
office
began
to
analyze
the
existing
law
and
prepared
first
an
initial
report
which
came
about
in
1961,
indicating
that
one
of
the
problems
under
existing
case
law,
under
the
old
act
was
a
continuing
and
indeed
growing
doubt
as
to
the
ability
to
protect
the
rights
of
derivative
works
utilizers,
particularly
where
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
reversion
of
the
underlying
copyright
on
a
novel,
for
example,
to
the
author
or
his
heirs.
it
is
true
that
right
from
that
beginning,
there
was
this
concern.
but
the
concern
didn't
really
come
to
a
point
of
issue
until
the
1963
draft
was
prepared
in
the
copyright
office,
and
there
for
the
first
time,
barbara
ringer,
one
of
the
principal...
if
not
the
principal...
draftsmen
of
the
statute,
as
a
practical
matter,
did
make
it
clear
that
the
exception,
pretty
much
as
it's
now
in
the
law,
would
be
a
suggested
way
of
taking
care
of
this
problem,
of
seeing
to
it
that
derivative
works
utilizers
were
protected.
and
this
was
not
an
insignificant
point,
because
under
the
old
law,
there
were
periods
of
time
where
very
famous
movies,
for
example,
such
as
gone
with
the
wind,
rear
window,
and
such
were
put
on
the
shelves
simply
because
it
was
commonly
then
thought
by
copyright
lawyers
that
in
the
event
of
a
reversion,
these
movies,
for
example,
in
other
words
would
lose
their
copyright
protection
as
derivative
works.
now,
it
was
this
kind
of
thing
that
congress
certainly
was
aware
of.
and
it's
also,
of
course,
true
though
that
what
happened
was
that
most
of
the
work,
seriously
in
this
whole
area,
was
done
in
the
copyright
office,
which
not
only
is
an
arm
of
the
congress,
but
which
was
embodied
in
six
booklets
transferred
to
the
congress.
mills
argues
that
since
there
is
no
dialogue,
no
colloquy
on
the
floor
of
the
house
or
in
any
of
the
committee
sessions
dealing
with
the
reversion
section
and
the
exception,
this
means
that
congress
never
understood
this,
never
did
anything
about
it.
well,
the
fact
is
that
they
didn't
do
anything
about
it
because
the
register
of
copyrights,
when
he
submitted
the
volumes
of
the
hearings
which
went
on
principally
from
'61
through
'65,
underscored
the
point
that
there
was
a
compromise
in
respect
to
this
business
of
the
reversion
and
the
exception
thereto.
so
we
argue,
in
short,
that
if
you
think
what
the
state
of
the
law
was,
how
the
people
who
were
professionals
understood
the
state
of
the
law...
and,
by
the
way,
two
very
articulate
lawyers
representing
the
publisher,
messrs.
abililes
and
wattenberg,
were
the
first
to
understand
and
consistently
understood
just
exactly
that
this
exception
did
not
benefit
or
help
publishers
or
middle
men
at
all.
therefore,
we
believe
that
what
happened
here
was
that,
contrary
to
the
suggestion
of
the
district
court,
was
that
such
legislative
history
as
there
is
firmly
supports
the
reading
of
the
statutes
which
the
snyders
have
consistently
taken
here
and
in
the
court
below;
and
furthermore,
that
it
is
a
consistent
position
as
a
matter
of
plain
language
in
the
statute.
let
me
emphasize
that
the
snyders
do
not
agree
with
mills
that
this
is
an
ambiguous
statute.
first
of
all,
it
seems
perfectly
clear
just
exactly
what
congress
is
attempting
to
achieve.
the
only
thing
that
is
at
issue
is
to
take
the
exception,
apply
its
clear
intent...
and
there
is
no
doubt,
as
we
argue
it,
that
if
you
take
the
exception
language,
it
applies
very
easily
to
a
one
transaction
or
one-step
transaction,
so
long
as
the
grantee
is
a
derivative
works
utilizer.
we
also
point
out
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
position
that
mills
finds
itself
in
as
an
absolute
free
rider
in
terms
of
the
objectives
of
the
statutory
language.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
mills
certainly
would
not.
no,
sir.
and
it
never
did.
mills
cannot
bring
itself
within
the
exception.
they
try
to
avoid
that.
they
simply
put
all
their
heavy
baggage
on
the
phrase
"under
the
terms
of
the
grant.
"
they
say
that
has
to
mean
the
first
grant,
and
the
statute
makes
it
very
clear
that
grant
has
keen
terminated,
at
least
so
far
as
everybody
is
concerned,
except
those
persons
who,
under
the
exception...
that
is,
creators
or
derivative
works
utilizers.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
no.
well,
in
a
sense.
what
we
say,
justice
rehnquist,
to
that
is,
once
you
read
304(c)(6),
you
understand
that
mills
stands
out.
snyder
stands
in
its
shoes
vis
a
vis
the
record
company.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
luxury
of
the
lunch
hour
recess
and
the
reflection
it
afforded
me
makes
me
wish
to
readdress
the
point
which
in
part
was
made
at
least
by
justice
stevens.
you,
sir,
asked
what
was
the
source
of
our
claim.
and
i
said,
among
other
things,
that
the
snyders
stand
now
in
the
shoes
of
mills.
permit
me
to
elucidate
a
bit
and
point
out
that
is
simply
because
of
the
reversion
provision
which
we're
talking
about.
the
snyders
now
own
the
copyright;
mills
does
not.
that's
why
in
our
brief,
we
go
into
the
analogies
to
real
estate
transactions,
patent
law
transactions,
and
other
commercial
transactions.
as
i
put
it
this
morning,
the
history
of
this
thing
is
that
the
snyders
start
out...
when
snyder
wrote
the
song
in
'23,
he
assigned
the
copyright
to
an
old
line
firm
in
new
york
which
went
bankrupt.
that
meant
that
mills
picked
up
the
rights
to
the
copyright
first
term
in
1940.
as
mr.
frankel
pointed
cut
this
morning,
that
meant
thereafter
that
mills
owned
the
copyright.
here,
we're
talking
about
the
underlying
copyright.
we're
not
talking
about
a
derivative
use
copyright,
as
i'm
sure
you
understand.
so
it
came
to
pass
that
when
congress
passed
the
'76
act
and
provided
that
there
would
be
an
extension
of
19
years,
bringing
the
total
copyright
period
more
in
line
with
european
countries
and
so
on,
and
would
give
authors
more
protection
that
75
years,
the
reversion
provision
necessarily
followed,
and
hence
it
is
that
snyder
is
once
again
the
owner
of
the
contract...
of
the
copyright...
excuse
me.
now,
that
means
that
if
you
look
at
that
source
and
then
you
look
to
the
terms
of
the
second
grant,
that
is,
the
grants
made
by
mills
to
the
music
company,
that
is
why
we
say
those
are
still
important
because
we
do
not
agree
with
mr.
frankel
that
there
is
some
sort
of
dichotomy
in
the
law.
there
isn't.
under
the
new
copyright
reversion
section,
all
that
has
happened
is
that
now
snyder
is
back,
owning
the
underlying
copyright,
in
the
place
of
mills,
and
should
receive
the
100
percent
royalties
provided
for
in
the
second
grants
to
the
derivative
works
utilizers.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
those
grants,
whether
it's
rca,
which
is
only
an
exempt--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--those
grant
terms
are
important.
and
they
still
have
to
be
given
effect.
that's
why,
as
i
repeat
again,
we
say
that
what
has
happened
here,
not
by
agreement
as
sometimes
in
commercial
transactions--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--we're
relying
on
both.
they
obviously
can't
be
there
if
there
wasn't
the
reversion.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
the
source
is
the
fact
that
we
now
stand
in
mills's
shoes,
plus
the
fact
that--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--no.
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
we
should
get
the
100
percent
royalties
which
those
grants
from
mills
to
the
derivative
use
people,
that
is,
the
record
companies,
provide.
the
issue
here
is
that
mills
says
that
even
though
they
have
been
removed
as
owner
of
the
underlying
copyright,
by
some
mysterious
incantation,
using
the
language
under
the
terms
of
the
grant,
they
should
continue
to
get
part
of
these
royalties.
that
isn't
what
congress
intended
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
because
under
the
reversion,
snyder
now
owns
the
underlying
copyright
which
is
the
source
of
mills's
authority
in
the
first
instance
to
make
grants
to
record
companies.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that
is
a
grant,
assumed
by
congress
to
mean
the
straight
one-step
grant
which
we
didn't
have
in
this
case.
tyler
grants
to
tyler...
the
copyright
owner
grants
to
white,
a
well-known
record
company,
a
derivative
works
grant.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
no.
in
the
one-step
transaction,
under
the
hypothetical,
white
has
the
right
to
produce
a
record.
he
does.
under
the
exception,
plainly,
that
grant...
tyler
to
white...
has
to
continue.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that
grant.
exactly.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
we
don't
have
that
case.
that's
why
we're
arguing,
contrary
to
mills,
that
the
only
problem
with
this
case
is
that
congress
didn't
write
out
the
language
which
would
cover
exactly
this
transaction.
mills
says
this
is
an
argument
of
ambiguity.
we
say
no;
all
this
is
is
a
classic
situation
where
an
appellate
court
is
asked
to
construe
a
statute,
the
clear
intent
of
which
is
there
for
all
to
see.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that's
the
error
that
the
district
court
fell
in
to.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
it
hurts
us
in
this
way.
it
misconstrues
the
statute,
both
in
terms
of
the
reversion
and
in
terms
of
the
exception.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
reversion
puts
snyder
back
as
the
underlying
copyright
owner.
mills
gets
knocked
out.
but
i
quite
agree
with
your
honor's
thrust
of
your
question
that
we
are
relying,
of
course,
on
that
second
grant,
if
you
will--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--that's
right.
we
say
that's
fine,
but
it
isn't
fine
for
mills.
so
to
sum
up,
what
we're
really
contending
here
is,
once
again,
that
if
you
look
at...
well,
take
the
reply
brief
of
mills.
they
frankly
exposed
this
to
all
who
will
read
or
listen.
they
still
continue
to
argue
that
there's
only
one
grant,
the
terminated
grant,
which
is
the
subject
not
only
of
the
termination
or
reversion
provision,
but
as
well
of
the
exception.
and
that
language
in
the
exception
just
can't
bury
that
low.
so,
ironically,
what
we
come
down
to
is
this:
mills
accuses
the
snyders
of
obfuscating,
distorting,
in
particular,
distorting
the
language.
we
argue
that,
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
held,
the
only
way
you're
going
to
distort
the
language
of
the
exception
in
particular
is
to
follow
the
theory
of
the
snyders.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
exactly.
so,
to
conclude,
it's
perfectly
clear,
if
you
look
at
the
language
and
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
that
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
answered
by
simply
saying
that
mills
doesn't
fit
in
the
class
designed
to
be
a
part
of
the
exception.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
yes.
i
think,
as
mr.
frankel
said
this
morning,
we
would
agree
on
that.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
are
you--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--yes.
we
argue
that--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
theoretically,
the
snyders
could
very
well
issue
new
grants
to
derivative
works
users.
but--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--no.
i
don't
think
there's
any...
as
i
understand
it,
the
old
song,
who's
sorry
now,
still
has
a
fair
amount
of
popularity.
but
we
don't
know
exactly
what
might
happen.
but
the
argument,
of
course,
really...
as
i
think
both
sides
agree
again...
focuses
only
on
the
old
derivative
works
grants.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
clear
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
the
snyders,
by
getting
back
in
the
shoes
of
a
copyright
owner,
should
have
the
right
in
the
19-year
term,
as
you
put
it,
to
realize
as
much
income
as
the
author
or
his
heirs
could.
i
think
there's
no
doubt
of
that.
my
only
problem
is,
i
don't
know
how
to
be
precise
in
anticipating
exactly
what
might
happen.
but
congress
surely
hoped,
as
your
question
implies,
that
they
would...
that
is,
the
author
or
his
heirs
would
be
in
a
position
to
get
that
type
of
income
negotiated,
of
course,
with
new
users.
thank
you
very
much.
