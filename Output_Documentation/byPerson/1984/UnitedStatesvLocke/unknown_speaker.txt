unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
that
language
was
employed?
was
this
just
a
boner
on
the
part
of
some
administrative
assistant,
or
was
there
a
real
purpose
in
having
it
before
december
31?
unknown
speaker
it
is
certainly
is
a
trap
for
the
unwary,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
had
the
provision
in
the
income
tax
law
before
april
15
or,
as
it
used
to
be,
march
15,
there
certainly
would
be
a
nationwide
howl
from
those
who
are
used
to
the
last
day
filing.
unknown
speaker
especially
the
fellow
who
gave
the
bad
advice.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
think
they
might
be
lying?
unknown
speaker
there
is
an
affidavit.
unknown
speaker
ms.
corwin,
could
congress
retroactively
cure
this
situation
for
the
lockes?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
government's
reaction
to
this
hardship
situation
is
that
people
who
want
to
acquire
rights
in
land
owned
by
the
government
can
be
required
to
turn
square
corners.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
think
you
advance
your
case
by
saying
that
it
wasn't
unreasonable
for
congress
to
do
this?
do
you
think
we
ought
to
sit
up
here
and
decide
whether
or
not
this
was
a
"reasonable"
statute
for
congress
to
have
passed?
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought
so,
too.
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
into
your
constitution
argument,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
a
possible
reading
of
the
statute?
the
deadline
here,
it
seems
to
me,
december
31st,
is
more
apt
to
deceive
someone
than
another
date,
where
you
say
prior
to
a
given
date.
it
seems
to
me
one
reading
this
statute
rather
hastily
might
incorrectly
assume
before
the
end
of
the
year
is
what
was
intended
by
congress
because
of
the
december
31st
date.
and
i
notice
that
you
have
a
footnote
in
your
brief
in
which
you
point
out
that
you
have
been
advised
by
the
agency
that
they
started
at
a
certain
time
sending
out
notices
to
tell
people
that
december
30
was
the
date
rather
than
december
31st.
why
would
they
do
that
if
they
didn't
think
there
was
some
possible
ambiguity
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
remind
them
to
be
sure
you
realize
it
is
the
30th
and
not
the
31st?
that
point
is
made
in
the
note.
unknown
speaker
would
it
compromise
the
government's
interests
in
this
whole
program
at
all
if
the
statute
were
simply
construed
as
though
it
had
said
on
or
before
instead
of
prior
to,
just
to
avoid
the
problem
that
occurred
in
this
case,
and
also
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
deciding
a
constitutional
question?
would
that
be
a
possible
solution
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
other
cases
but
this
one
in
which
the
person
missed
it
by
one
date?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
at
least
seem
theoretically
possible
that
that
might
be
exactly
what
congress
thought
it
was
doing
and
was
a
little
careless
in
its
writing?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
be
better
for
the
court
not
to
adopt
that
construction,
but
rather,
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
constitutional
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
corwin,
you
said
you
thought
it
was
fairly
clear
the
statute
should
be
construed
in
a
particular...
the
wording,
i
take
it,
is
31st>
["].
do
you
think
there
is
any
ambiguity
at
all
in
those
four
words?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
language
the
statute
used
tied
it
up
with
an
abandonment,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
rather
a
strange
way
of
describing
what
you
just
were
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
it
is
strange.
i
will
put
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
read
the
statute,
you
would
think
that
they
were
equating
failure
to
file,
even
a
negligent
failure
to
file,
with
an
intention
to
abandon.
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
unknown
speaker
it
also
usually
means
that
you
have
some
intention
to
do
so.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
the
administrator
or
if
the
secretary
had
decided
to
by
his
regulations
say...
if
he
said
that
a
failure
to
file
shall
be
presumptive
evidence
of
an
abandonment,
but
we
will
have
a
hearing
to
see
if
there
was
an
intent
to
abandon,
do
you
think
that
would
be
an
invalid
regulation?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
mining
congress
is
made
up
of,
you
know,
big
time
commercial
miners
that
are
probably
more
than
equipped
to
deal
with
various
regulations
in
a
way
that
perhaps
the
respondents
here
aren't.
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
look
at
what
the
statute
said
on
its
face,
your
client
is
out.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
you
are
not
saying
interpret
it
literally
and
apply
it.
you
are
saying
interpret
it
literally
and
it
is
unconstitutional
to
apply
it.
unknown
speaker
what
makes
you
think
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
are
looking
as
to
what
congress
might
have
intended,
perhaps
their
mistake
was
in
choosing
to
analogize
what
is
essentially
a
forfeiture
to
abandonment.
i
mean,
congress
wanted
this
terminated
if
the
thing
wasn't
filed.
perhaps
they
were
mistaken
to
have
suggested
that
it
was
a
conclusive
abandonment.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you,
instead
of
reading
the
congressional
record
or
the
discussion,
just
read
the
statute?
surely
it
is
absolutely
clear
from
the
statute
that
they
intended
a
forfeiture,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
any
more
so
than
the
april
15th
deadline
on
the
question
that
was
put
to
the
government?
the
april
15th
tax
return.
one
day
late
and
you
are
just
as
badly
off
as
six
months
or
a
year,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
i
am
addressing
the
language
31st>
["].
isn't
that
just
as
clear
as
april
15th?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
describe
the
property
interest,
if
any,
that
the
claim
owner
has?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
he
can
exclude
others
from
the
claim,
can
he?
unknown
speaker
but
he
can
exclude
them
from--
unknown
speaker
--aren't
there
some
other
conditions
besides
filing
on
the
continuation
of
that
claim?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
doesn't
some
year?
unknown
speaker
don't
say
suppose.
it
is
forfeited,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
just
forfeits.
if
by
the
end
of
the
year
you
haven't
done
your
assessment
work,
you
are
out
of
business.
unknown
speaker
and
the
government
contests
it,
just
like
this,
says,
you
have
failed
to
do
your
assessment
work,
your
claim
is
cancelled,
your
claim
is
out.
now,
if
you
want
to
litigate
with
us
as
to
whether
you
did
your
assessment
work,
why,
come
on
in.
and
he
said,
well,
i
didn't
do
my
assessment
work,
but
nevertheless
i
am
still
in.
he
can't
win
that,
can
he?
unknown
speaker
why?
how?
unknown
speaker
how
can
he
win
it
against
the
government?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
government
may
not
enforce
its
requirement
of
doing
assessment
work?
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
because
of
the
intent
of
congress,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
of
the
intent
of
congress.
unknown
speaker
unless
it
was
held
that
he
had
abandoned
it.
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
nature
of
the
property
interest
is
such
that
the
government,
instead
of
saying,
please
file
or
you
lose
your
interest,
you
think
the
government
could
just
send
a
letter
to
all...
investigate
and
get
the
names
of
all
the
holders
of
mining
claims
and
just
writes
them
a
letter
saying,
everybody
who
hasn't
got
a
patent
is
now
forfeited?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
constitution
would
prevent
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
your
position
then
in
this
case
is
that
your
client
could
just
refuse
to
file
at
all.
unknown
speaker
and
as
long
as
he
could
show
that
he
had
no
intent
to
abandon,
the
he
was
working
the
mine
every
day,
he
could
just
tell
you,
forget
this
filing
business.
that
interferes
with
my
property
rights.
unknown
speaker
say
he
just
said,
i
am
just
never
going
to
file,
but
i
would
be
willing...
i
will
litigate
with
you
any
time
about
whether
i
have
abandoned,
and
i
will
always
win.
can
he
get
away
with
that?
unknown
speaker
he
just
writes
back...
he
just
writes
back
and
says,
i
am
sorry,
but
i
am
just
not
going
to
ever
file
under
this
statute,
and
you
can't
terminate
my
claim
until
and
unless
i
abandon.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
file?
