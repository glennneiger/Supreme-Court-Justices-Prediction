ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
1976,
congress
enacted
the
federal
land
policy
and
management
act,
known
as
flpma.
this
was
the
first
statute
to
give
the
bureau
of
land
management
comprehensive
authority
to
manage
the
public
lands.
in
the
course
of
enacting
flpma,
congress
sought
to
provide
a
solution
for
a
long
standing
public
land
management
problem
that
involved
the
lack
of
information
about
unpatented
mining
claims
that
had
been
located
on
millions
of
acres
of
federal
lands.
since
the
1860's
and
1870's,
when
that
system
of
mining
claims
on
federal
lands
was
established,
millions
of
claims
had
been
located
on
federal
lands.
the
problem
was
that
no
one
knew
where
they
were
or
what
their
status
was.
the
general
mining
laws
didn't
provide
any
mechanism
for
notification
to
the
federal
government
when
a
claim
was
located
or
when
it
was
abandoned.
the
only
time
a
claimant
had
to
report
to
the
federal
government
concerning
his
claim
was
if
he
elected
to
proceed
to
patent,
that
is,
to
take
steps
to
obtain
full
ownership
of
the
land
on
which
the
claim
was
located.
most
claimants
didn't
bother
to
take
that
step,
so
blm
did
not
have
any
information
on
the
status
of
these
claims,
and
that
situation
made
it
very
difficult
for
the
federal
land
managers
to
take
actions
with
respect
to
federal
lands.
unless
blm
did
some
fairly
extensive
research
at
the
local
county
courthouse
and
then
tried
to
track
down
all
of
these
potential
claimants
it
identified,
it
simply
couldn't
be
sure
one
way
or
the
other
about
whether
the
land
at
issue
was
encumbered
by
such
claims.
and
that
interfered
with
the
ability
to
go
ahead
and
take
action
with
respect
to
a
piece
of
land.
now,
congress
sought
to
remedy
that
situation
in
section
314
of
flpma.
under
that
section,
a
claimant
must
make
an
initial
filing
with
the
bureau
of
land
management
within
three
years
of
the
passage
of
the
statute.
the
claimant
then
must
update
that
information
annually
by
filing
a
piece
of
paper
prior
to
december
31st.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
the
legislative
history
does
not
give
any
clues
one
way
or
the
other
about
why
that
particular
filing
deadline
was
chosen,
and
i
suppose
there
are
several
possibilities,
one
of
which
you
suggest.
it
could
be
that
someone
simply
was
careless
in
drafting
and
didn't
realize
that
they
had
done
what
they
had
done.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
fair
to
characterize
it
that
way.
i
certainly
don't
think
anybody
at
the
time
regarded
it
that
way.
that
is,
i
think
it
may
have
been
simply
a
failure
to
look
closely
at
what
they
had
done.
it
is
conceivable
it
was
somebody
with
a
good
intention
to
foresee
a
problem
of
the
office
closing
right
before
new
year's
or
something.
i
don't
know
what
it
was,
but--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
it
would
certainly
be
difficult
to
adjust.
of
course,
this
was
a
new
provision,
and
i
suppose
that...
and
people
who
look
at
this
statute
carefully,
i
think,
can
figure
out
that
prior
to
december
31st
doesn't
mean
on
december
31st.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
would
point
out
that
that
is
an
affidavit
on
the
part
of
the
appellees
in
this
case.
there
has
been
no
finding
as
to
the
facts
on
that
particular
issue.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
am
not
suggesting
he
is
lying.
i
am
just
suggesting
on
the
record
of
this
case
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--there
is
an
affidavit,
but
neither
the
court
nor
the
administrative
board
found
it
necessary
to
make
a
determination
as
to
what
had
happened
in
terms
of
advice
given
or
understanding
of
the
advice.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
this
is
a
difficult
case
in
several
respects.
that
is
certainly
correct,
justice
blackmun.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
run
into
whenever
you
have
a
filing
deadline
or
a
filing
cutoff.
you
are
always
going
to
have
people
who
fall
just
slightly
on
the
other
side.
i
suppose--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
that's
correct.
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
are
not
going
to
find
themselves
in
this
situation,
and
that
would,
of
course,
be
all
the
people
who
can
still
locate
because
they
have
locatable
minerals
like
gold
and
silver
and
lead
and
so
on.
you
are
also
going
to
have
the
people
who
file
enough
in
advance
to
avoid
this
tough
situation
at
the
end
of
the
year.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that
is
correct,
although
that
particular
regulation
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
this
particular
situation
came
along,
but
that
is
the
case
today.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
my
understanding
is
that
congress
could
take
steps,
and
indeed
it
has
taken
steps
in
the
case
of
oil
and
gas
plaser
claims.
congress
did
enact
a
provision
which
i
believe
is
at
30
usc
188(f)
in
which
it
said
people
who
miss
the
deadline
and
who
have
the
oil
and
gas
plaser
claims
can
take
certain
steps,
and
they
will
not
get
their
claims
back
under
the
general
mining
laws,
but
they
will
be
eligible
for
noncompetitive
leases
of
these
oil
and
gas
deposits.
i
suppose
something
equivalent
could
be
done
here
if
congress
felt
that
there
was
a
real
problem.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
that's
correct,
and
certainly
we
understand
that
there
are
these
difficulties,
and
the
secretary
has
attempted
to
administer
the
statute
in
a
way
that
is
both
consistent
with
what
congress
has
said
and
that
accommodates
an
understanding
of
the
difficulties
people
face.
but
i
don't
think
it
was
unreasonable
for
congress
to
make
the
judgment
that
in
this
particular
situation
with
millions
of
claims
it
was
appropriate
to
put
the
responsibility
for
communicating
intent
to
retain
the
claim
on
federal
land
on
the
claimant.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
the
issue
here
is
the
constitutionality
of
what
congress
has
done.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that's
correct.
there
has
been
much
suggestion,
i
think,
in
the
briefs
that
were
filed
in
this
case
that
congress
couldn't
possibly
have
meant
to
do
this,
that
this
is
quite
an
unreasonable
result,
and
my
suggestion
is
that,
following
your
suggestion
about
turning
square
corners,
it
is
certainly
reasonable
to
expect
that
sort
of
reaction
from
claimants
in
this
particular
circumstance.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
that's
correct.
the
court
in
texaco
initially
examined
whether
it
was
within
the
legislature's
power
to
do
something
like
this,
and
there
was
discussion
of
reasonableness.
that
is
correct.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
ambiguity,
but
i
think
the
secretary
recognized
that
there
could
be
people
who
weren't
really
in
tune
with
the
system
yet.
the
notice
doesn't
simply
say
what
the
date
is.
i
think
it
says
a
little
bit
more
than
that.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
it
does
phrase
it
as
on
or
before
december
30th,
which
the
regulations
do
as
well,
and
i
think
that
is
an
attempt
to
make
sure
that
people
focus
on
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
look
as
though
december
31st
is
part
of
this.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
in
terms
of
the
government's
interests,
looking
simply
at
that,
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
consider
what
has
gone
on
since
the
statute
in
terms
of
things
that
may
have
occurred
with
relocations
by
third
parties.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
my
understanding
from
the
filings
of
the
amici
in
this
case
is
that
there
are
other
cases
like
that.
now,
i
don't
know
how
many
of
those
are
people
who
very
much
want
to
continue
their
claims
and
would
then
come
back
and
say
you
want
to
pick
up
on
the
claims
if
that
reading
of
the
statute
were
possible.
but
you
do
have
this
problem
of
what
has
gone
on
since
the
statute.
in
terms
of
the
one
day
difference,
i
guess
i
would
have
to
say
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
if
congress
had
said
december
31st--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
think
it
is
possible.
my
problem
is
that
i
don't
think
there
is
a
100
percent
possibility
that
that
is
what
congress
meant.
i
guess
i
am
only
about
80
percent
sure,
or
maybe
less.
i'm
not
sure.
but
the
language
is
fairly
clear
on
its
face
in
terms
of
prior
to
december
31st.
and
for
that
reason
i
doubt
my
own
initial
reaction
to
this,
because
clearly
whoever
wrote
it
knew
that
december
31st
existed.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
reach
the
reading
that
you
have
suggested
just
because
there
is
doubt,
because
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
because
there
are
plausible
reasons
why
somebody
might
have
perhaps
wrongheadedly
sat
down
and
said,
you
know,
we
won't
have
people
filing
on
the
last
day
of
the
year,
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
obviously,
in
the
interests
of
the
government,
it
would
help
to
have
it
resolved,
but
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
is
a
reason
that
you
shouldn't
construe
the
statute.
i
am
saying
that
i
think
there
are
other
problems
with
that
approach.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
don't
think
there's
any
ambiguity
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
i
might
note
that
the
secretary
has
construed
the
language
of
the
statute
to
be
on
or
before
december
30th,
so
if
there
were
any
ambiguity,
i
suppose
you
could
look
to
the
administrative
construction
to
back
up
your
natural
reading
of
the
statute.
i
think
justice
stevens
was
suggesting
that
somebody
might
come
to
the
conclusion
that
whoever
wrote
the
statute
must
have
slipped
and
meant
before
the
end
of
the
year.
i
might
note
that
nobody
in
this
case
is
urging
that
construction
of
the
statute.
appellees
acknowledge
that
they
have
missed
the
deadline,
and
as
i
noted,
the
secretary
construes
it
that
way.
the
district
court
didn't
seem
to
disagree
with
that,
either.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
have
simply
found
nothing
that
suggests
one
way
or
the
other
anything
about
that
31st>
["]
language,
so
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
we
can
look
to
one
way
or
the
other
there.
now,
appellees
were
mining
claimants
whose
ten
claims
were
located
on
federal
lands
in
the
state
of
nevada.
they
had
mined
their
claims
since
1960,
but
they
had
never
proceeded
to
patent
on
those
claims.
following
the
enactment
of
flpma,
they
filed
their
initial
recordation
statement
in
october
of
1979
in
a
timely
manner.
then,
in
1980,
they
filed
their
affidavits
of
annual
assessment
work
with
the
local
recorder's
office,
august
of
1980,
but
they
waited
until
december
31st
of
1980
to
file
that
same
piece
of
paper
with
the
federal
bureau
of
land
management
office.
since
the
statute
does
require
filings
prior
to
december
31st,
blm
advised
appellees
that
their
claims
were
void
by
operation
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
because
of
section
314(c),
which
is
the
provision
that
is
really
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
congress
provided
there
that
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
filing
requirements
would
be
deemed
conclusively
to
constitute
an
abandonment
of
the
claim.
in
other
words,
compliance
with
the
filing
requirement
would
be
a
condition
to
continued
retention
of
the
claim.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
congress
did
use
the
word
"abandonment".
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
am
not
so
sure
it
is
strange.
it
is
inartful.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
it
is
possibly
inartful,
and
it
is
certainly
circumlocution.
i
think
it
was
kind
of
a
roundabout
way
of
getting
to
what
congress
was
after,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
either
from
the
face
of
the
statute
or
from
the
legislative
history
that
what
congress
really
had
in
mind
was
that
if
you
don't
file
your...
make
your
filings
on
an
annual
basis
in
a
timely
manner,
you
are
going
to
lose
your
claim.
they
used
this
intermediate
step.
they
said--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
think
what
they
did
was
use
a
two-step
procedure,
which
is
sort
of
roundabout.
they
said
failure
to
file
will
be
the
equivalent
of
abandonment,
and
we
all
know
that
abandonment
means
you
lose
your
claim,
and
they
were
just
using--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
in
the
common
law
sense
that
is
so,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
necessarily
unusual
in
that
there
are
statutes
that
are
phrased
in
this
sort
of
terminology,
for
example,
in
the
general
mining
laws,
30
usc
27,
i
think,
contains
some
language
that
says
"considered
abandoned"
when
you
don't
spend
enough
time
on
your
tunnel
development,
and
in
this
court's
decision
in
texaco
versus
short,
the
indiana
statute
there
was
not
phrased
in
these
terms.
it
talked
directly
about
extinguishment
of
the
interest.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
don't
think
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress.
i
think
here
you
have
a
statute
that
was
designed
to
really
simplify
and
to
provide
some
certainty
in
this
area.
i
think
the
underlying
point
of
this
section,
section
314(c),
is
to
provide
land
managers
with
what
they
had
lacked
prior
to
1976,
and
that
was
the
ability
to
know
for
sure
what
the
status
of
the
claim
was.
the
point
of
this
was
to
provide
this
sort
of
bright
line
distinction
between
who
was
in
and
who
was
out
that
would
permit
land
managers
to
say
for
sure
what
the
status
of
the
claim
was.
now,
i
think
they
used
this
roundabout
language
which,
as
i
was
saying,
this
court
itself
used
when
it
referred
to
the
indiana
statute...
there
are
several
places
in
the
texaco
versus
short
opinion
in
which
the
court
says
"deemed
abandoned"
or
"assumed
abandoned".
i
don't
think
that
is
an
unusual
formulation
in
these
land
laws.
but
i
think
that
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
that
was
to
provide
a
solution
to
this
long-standing
land
management
problem
which
was
essentially
the
problem
of
knowing
for
certain
what
the
status
of
the
claim
was.
now,
there
is
no
real
question,
i
think,
about
congress's
constitutional
power
to
enact
a
provision
like
this,
to
impose
a
filing
deadline
as
a
condition
for
retention
of
the
claim.
it
is
quite
reasonable
for
congress
to
provide
something
that
allows
federal
land
managers
to
know
what
the
status
of
asserted
rights
on
public
lands
might
be.
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
provided
appropriate
process
in
connection
with
that
sort
of
provision.
and
that
is
how
the
appellees
have
framed
their
claim
in
the
district
court
and
here.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
there
is
adequate
process
in
at
least
two
respects.
one
is
that
there
is
clearly
notice
of
the
terms
of
this
statute,
of
section
314.
texaco
versus
short
provides
a
standard,
i
think,
and
here
we
clearly
need
it.
we
have
a
three-year
grace
period.
we
have
people
who
know
that
they
are
under
a
system
of
federal
regulation
and
can
be
expected
to
keep
up
with
what
is
going
on
in
the
area.
here,
you
don't
even
have
that
question,
because
these
people
clearly
knew
about
the
statute.
they
clearly
knew
about
section
314.
the
only
thing
they
didn't
look
closely
at
was
that
particular
filing
date.
you
also
have
adequate
process
in
connection
with
the
final
adjudication
as
to
whether
someone
has
complied
with
the
statute.
this
is
the
procedure
under
which
these
appellees
and
other
claimants
receive
notice.
if
it
appears
that
they
have
not
complied,
they
have
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals
on
the
crucial
question
under
the
statute,
which
is
whether
or
not
you
have
complied
with
the
filing
requirements.
so,
the
only
question
that
is
really
left
is
whether
you
have
to
provide
one
more
round
of
notice
in
terms
of
an
individualized
card
from
blm
that
says,
your
friendly
blm
office
would
like
to
remind
you,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
not
constitutionally
required
in
a
case
like
this.
i
might
note
that
the
american
mining
congress,
a
major
industry
group,
was
a
strong
supporter
of
this
provision,
a
proponent,
and
had
in
fact
proposed
it
back
in
1968
in
similar
terms.
they
didn't
seem
to
think
this
sort
of
extra
round
of
notice
was
necessary,
and
congress,
i
think,
looking
at
the--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
think
that...
several
points,
i
suppose.
the
respondents
here...
excuse
me.
the
appellees
here
could
simply
look
at
the
regulation
and
see
on
the
face
of
it
what
the
answer
was.
but
i
don't
think
the
american
mining
congress
was
necessarily
simply
thinking
about
the
interests
of
big
groups.
mobil
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
and
it
seems
to
have
a
similar
problem,
so
i
don't
think
the
american
mining
congress
was
focused
solely
on
the
big
people
on
this.
the
situation
of
the
mining
claimant
is
that
they
come
and
they
go
in
a
lot
of
cases.
many
of
them
are
not
in
a
situation
of
appellees
here.
they
don't
have
a
stable
producing
operation.
there
are
people
who
come
onto
the
land,
who
locate
their
claim,
who
decide
after
a
year
or
two
that
it
is
really
not
worth
it,
they
just
don't
find
what
they
thought
they
might
find,
and
they
move
on.
in
those
sorts
of
circumstances,
they
are
the
ones
who
know
whether
they
want
to
keep
the
claim.
it
is
reasonable
for
congress
to
have
concluded
that
they
could
assume
the
minimal
burden
of
providing
a
piece
of
paper
each
year
to
the
government.
now,
appellees
and
amici
have
suggested
alternatively,
and
the
district
court
also
accepted
this
argument,
that
some
sort
of
substantial
compliance
would
be
sufficient
under
this
statute.
if
you
come
close
enough,
then
you
ought
to
assure
that
you
are
not
going
to
lose
your
claim,
they
suggest.
i
would
like
to
suggest
briefly
why
we
don't
think
that
is
so.
the
face
of
the
statute
does
not
seem
to
suggest
that
there
is
this
leeway
to
sort
of
deviate
from
the
statute
to
one
extent
or
another.
it
doesn't
suggest
a
sliding
scale
of
compliance.
remember
that
this
system
involves
millions
of
claims.
i
think
congress
was
aware
that
if
it
established
this
sort
of
a
sliding
scale
standard,
the
secretary
could
be
faced
with
thousands,
tens
of
thousands,
maybe
hundreds
of
thousands
of
factual
situations
in
which
people
come
in
and
say,
well,
two
weeks
late,
a
month
and
a
half
late,
that
didn't
hurt
you,
that
is
substantial
compliance.
and
at
the
same
time,
i
think
the
secretary
is
going
to
be
faced
with
a
situation
under
that
sort
of
standard
in
which
he
doesn't
have
any
good
way
to
decide
what
the
cutoff
should
be.
you
are
going
to
have
people
arguing
that
it
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
cut
it
off
at
one
point
or
another.
you
are
going
to
have
not
only
claimants
who
are
disappointed.
you
are
going
to
have
third
party
people
who
thought
they
were
going
to
be
able
to
relocate
or
to
locate
claims
after
someone
else's
had
lapsed
under
this
statute.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
indication
that
congress
intended
to
impose
that
sort
of
administratively
complex
system
in
the
context
of
a
statute
that
was
designed
to
simplify
things.
it
is
like
the
argument
about
abandonment.
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
was
envisioning
some
massive
factfinding
process
that
would
require
the
blm
to
take
evidence
on
the
intent
to
abandoned.
in
your
heart
you
may
want
to
keep
your
claim,
but
i
think
the
point
here
was,
if
you
don't
submit
something
that
is
objective
evidence
that
land
managers
can
rely
on,
congress
made
the
determination
that
you
would
lose
your
claim
in
those
circumstances.
if
there
are
no
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
have
nothing
further,
unless
there
are
other
questions.
