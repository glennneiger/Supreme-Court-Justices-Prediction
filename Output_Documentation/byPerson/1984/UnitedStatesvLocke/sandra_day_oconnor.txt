of
course,
ms.
corwin,
if
it
were
another
type
of
memo
other
than
sand
and
gravel
or
one
of
the
things
that
cannot
be
relocated,
a
person
missing
the
filing
deadline
presumably
could
relocate
on
december
31
if
the
came
in
a
day
late
and
realized
then
that
they
had
missed
the
date,
unless
someone
had
filed
ahead
of
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
are
dealing
with
a
particularly
difficult
situation,
are
we
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
will
have
the
people
who
simply
mail
the
notice,
the
annual
notice
in
on
december
30,
and
even
if
it
is
received
up
until
january
19th,
it
is
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course,
in
that
texaco
versus
short
decision,
there
is
language
in
the
opinion
that
speaks
of
upholding
the
state
law
in
that
case
because
it
imposed
reasonable
conditions
on
intention.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
support
that,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
swafford,
would
you
concede
that
at
least
the
people
who
had
not
filed
a
mining
claim
before
the
enactment
of
the
new
law,
that
the
government
can
set
whatever
conditions
it
wants
to
enable
people
to
obtain
mining
claims
on
public
land?
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sure.
somebody
who
has
never
filed
before
this
law
was
passed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
you
don't
have
any
problem
with
those,
do
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
distinguishes
that
principle,
then,
for
people
who
have
already
filed
but
haven't
perfected
their
claim,
the
unpatented
mining
claim?
can
the
government
come
in
and
establish
new
conditions
for
obtaining
the
patent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
can
it
not
come
in
and
establish
other
requirements
for
holding
onto
an
unpatented
mining
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
position
has
already
conceded
that
the
earlier
filing
of
an
intention
to
retain
a
claim
is
valid,
so
you
do
concede
that
the
government
can
come
in
and
impose
some
additional
conditions
on
holding
an
unpatented
claim?
