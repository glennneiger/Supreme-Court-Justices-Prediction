mr.
harold
a.
swafford
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
pointed
out
by
the
appellants,
the
lockes
own
ten
unpatented
mining
claims
near
ely,
nevada,
which
they
have
operated
for
24
years.
on
april
4th,
1981,
the
bureau
of
land
management
in
reno
issued
an
opinion
stating
that
the
locke's
claims
were
deemed
to
be
abandoned
because
they
had
filed
an
annual
affidavit
one
day
late.
the
lockes
had
fully
complied
with
the
statute
the
prior
year
in
regard
to
their
initial
filings.
under
the
act,
they
were
required
to
file
certificates
of
location
for
each
of
their
claims,
maps,
affidavits,
and
they
did
all
of
that
prior
to
the
deadline
in
october
of
1979.
the
court
found
below
that
the
blm
had
then
opened
a
file
on
the
lockes
showing
their
claims
to
be
active
mining
claims.
now,
the
statute
at
issue
herein
provides
that
the
failure
to
file
any
of
the
instruments
required
in
the
act
shall
be
deemed
conclusively
to
constitute
an
abandonment
of
the
claim
by
the
owner.
the
district
court
viewed
that
as
an
irrebuttable
presumption
which
to
us
seems
pretty
obvious
on
its
face,
and
decided
the
case
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
vlandis
versus
klein
and
other
irrebuttable
presumption
cases.
the
court
found
that
because
that
presumption
of
abandonment
wasn't
unnecessary
or
universally
true,
especially
where
the
lockes
had
operated
their
claims
for
24
years,
and
indicated
by
filing
their
documents
that
they
didn't
intend
to
abandon,
they
should
have
a
hearing
or
some
method
by
which
they
should
have
an
opportunity
to
rebut
the
presumption.
now,
the
appellants
attacked
the
district
court's
decision
by
saying
that
this
doesn't
present
an
irrebuttable
presumption
at
all,
and
they
argue
further
that
the
court
ought
to
decide
the
case
in
accordance
with
texaco
versus
short.
we
think
this
is
a
pretty
novel
interpretation,
and
the
court
should
look
at
the
statute,
look
at
what
it
says
on
its
face,
and
not
search
for
other
meanings
in
other
cases.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
no,
i
think
if
we
look
at
what
it
says
on
its
face,
it
is
an
impermissible,
irrebuttable
presumption.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
in
answer
to
your
question
earlier
of
whether
there
was
a
boner,
i
believe
justice
blackmun
answered
that.
i
think
there
was
a
mistake.
i
think
congress
intended
to
apply
a
rebuttable
presumption,
some
kind
of
a--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--because
a
conclusive
presumption
just
doesn't
fit
in
with
notions
of
abandonment
that
require
an
intent.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
i
think
congress
intended
to
terminate
inactive,
long
dormant,
and
abandoned
mines.
there
was
no
intent
on
congress's
part
that
i
can
find
from
any
reading
of
the
congressional
record
or
any
of
the
statements
by
the
american
mining
congress
or
anybody
else
that
they
intended
to
forfeit
operating
mines.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
it
is
a
contradiction
of
terms.
they
use
the
word
"abandonment",
which
means
intent
on
the
part
of
the
miner
to
relinquish
his
property.
it
is
just
a
contradiction
in
terms
to
say
"conclusively
deemed
to
be
abandoned".
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
well,
i
believe
there
is
a
deadline
for
filing
tax
returns,
and
there
are
other
deadlines
in
statutes,
other
statutes,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
conclusive
presumption.
i
don't
understand,
i
don't
think,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
i
think
it
is
a
statement
that
congress
wanted
it
filed
by
december
30th.
i
think
that
is
a
clear
statement,
though
it
is,
as
the
district
court
found,
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
i
don't
think
that
makes
it
any...
i
don't
think
that
gives
a
person
another
day.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
the
claim
owner
has
a
property
interest
as
defined
by
this
court
in
wilbur
versus
united
states.
he
has
property
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
term.
he
has
an
operating
mine
for
which
he
earns--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--not
from
the
claim
surface.
i
don't
believe
he--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--from
the
mine
itself,
which
is
the
vein
of
ore
that
he
is
operating
and
his...
the
works
that
he
has
devised
to
get
to
it.
i
don't
think
he
could
exclude
the
blm,
for
example,
leasing
out
a
mine
for
grazing
purposes,
or
for...
he
couldn't
exclude
hunters
or--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--he
has
to
perform
his
assessment
work
every
year,
at
least
$100
worth.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
if
he
doesn't
then,
of
course,
then
the
claim
can
be
forfeited,
i
suppose.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
it
is
lost
by
relocation
by
a
junior
locator
or
if
the
government
contested
it,
yes.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
if
certain
conditions
arise.
one
is,
of
course,
a
junior
locator.
another
one
is
if
he
hasn't
substantially--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--i
think
he
can
as
against
the
government.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
but
not
as
against
the
junior
locator.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
well,
i
think
cases
have
decided,
and
in
the
hickel--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--i
think
that's
correct
as
to
assessment
work.
i
think
hickel
versus
united
states,
and
the
cases
that
were
decided
there,
is
that
assessment
work,
the
failure
to
do
assessment
work
is
not
something
the
government
can
assert,
but
only
a
junior
locator
because
even
if
a
person
doesn't
do
this--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--well,
i
think
that
is
court
interpretations.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
yes,
i
believe,
because
if
a
person
didn't
do
it
for
20
years,
and
there
were
no
intervening
junior
locators
he
could
resume
doing
his
assessment
work--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--unless
he
has
been
held...
i
agree
with
that.
if
he
had
abandoned
the
claim,
had
an
intention
to
abandon
it,
then
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
i
don't
think
that
would
be
possible
constitutionally.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
i
think
it
would,
and
there
is
some
language
in
the
dissent
in
texaco
versus
short
that
states
that
if
the
government
were
to
issue
a
fiat
simply
terminating
mineral
interests
across
the
board,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
absent
just
compensation.
i
think
the
government
could
do
it,
but
it
would
probably
have
to
pay
for
it,
is
what
the
final
result
would
be.
but
the--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--no,
i
don't
believe--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--i
think
at
some
point
he
needs
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
show,
because
of
the
statute,
because
if
congress,
i
think,
wanted
an
abandonment
it
would
say
that.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
well,
i
think
if
there
are
no
intervening
people,
and
the
government
hasn't
taken
any
position
on
it,
which
was
a
point
made
in
the
wilbur
versus
krushnic
case,
that
if
the
court...
or
if
the
government
has
not
intervened
to
take
action,
then
it
may
very
well
be
that
he
has
substantially
complied
by
correcting
at
some
later
date.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
under
this
particular
statute,
that
may
be
the
result.
it
may
very
well
be,
because--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
he
has
to
have
an
intent
to
abandon
his
mine
whenever
that
occurs.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
by
the
30th.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
well,
i
think
he
would
only
lose
if
he
had
an
intent
not
to
abandon
his
operating
mine.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
i
don't
think
the
lockes
ever
recognized
the
constitutional
validity
of
it.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
they
filed,
and
they
complied
in--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--not
in
1979.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
they
are
not
protesting
the
initial
filings.
we
think
the
initial
filing
requirements
are
constitutional.
we
are
objecting
to
the
forfeiture
of
operating
mining
claims
by
not
filing
an
annual
affidavit.
we
feel
that
the
government
has
a...
that
there
was
no
other
way
to
do
it
as
to
the
six
million
claims
that
existed
out
there.
the
solicitor
has
explained--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--conditions
for
obtaining
property
in
the
first
place,
is
what
you
are
saying.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
they
have
to
comply
with
whatever
conditions,
whether
it
is
doing
$10,000
worth
of
work
instead
of
$100,
or
filing
any
document
the
government
wants.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
for
obtaining
a
patent?
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
i
think
if
somebody
wanted
to
obtain
a
patent
and
congress
wanted
to
increase,
say,
from
$500
to
$10,000,
i
think
congress
could
do
that.
it
would
make
it
a
condition
of--
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
--not
when
congress
has
set
up
abandonment
as
one
of
the...
as
the
reason
for
losing
the
claim,
as
it
has
here.
mr.
harold
a.
swafford
yes.
i
think
in
a
certain
circumstance,
but
not
here.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
done
here
under
this
statute,
is
why
i
have
problems
with
it,
because
it
did
set
up
abandonment,
i
think,
as
the
standard
for
losing
your
claim.
now,
there
are
differences
in
texaco
versus
short
with
this
case,
i
mean,
major
differences,
in
that
the
treatment...
it
is
the
treatment
of
operating
mines
that
is
really
different
in
the
two
statutes.
in
the
texaco
versus
short
context,
operating
mining
claims
are
protected
because
the
statute
is
only
directed
to
eliminating
claims
where
work
has
not
been
done
for
more
than
20
years.
in
this
statute,
congress
chose
to
protect
operating
mines,
i
think,
by
requiring
that
they
be
abandoned.
because
of
that
difference,
i
think
the
court
should
not
adopt
and
force
this
case
into
a
texaco
versus
short
situation.
here,
we
do
have
the
clear,
irrebuttable
presumption,
and
i
think
the
district
court
was
right,
and
this
court
should
affirm
that,
on
deciding
this
case
in
accordance
with
vlandis
versus
klein.
now,
the
court
also
found
that
the
lockes
had
substantially
complied
with
the
statute
by
doing
many
things.
now,
the
government
says
you
can't
substantially
comply
with
the
cutoff
date,
but
the
act
required
numerous
things
to
be
done.
the
act
required
the
lockes
to
file
in
1979
their
certificates
of
labor...
location,
the
maps
and
the
affidavits
of
labor.
in
1980,
the
lockes
produced
$1
million
worth
of
materials,
and
they
filed
their
affidavit
with
the
white
pine
county,
nevada,
recorder's
office,
and
they
also
filed
that
with
the
bureau
of
land
management
in
reno,
although
it
was
one
day
late.
the
court
looked
at
all
of
the
acts,
the
things
that
the
lockes
had
done,
and
stated
that
they
had
substantially
met
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
the
court
relied
on
hickel
versus
shell
oil
company
in
that
line
of
cases
which
dealt
with
performance
of
annual
assessment
work.
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
ruled
that
if
you
substantially
complied,
that
is
sufficient
under
the
assessment
work.
the
lower
court
did
not
see
that
any
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
would
be
defeated
by
having
the
lockes...
by
ruling
in
their
favor
on
substantial
compliance.
in
other
words,
they
found
that
the
purposes
of
the
act
were
to
eliminate
this
long
buildup
of
six
million
long
dormant
claims
on
the
public
domain.
those
purposes
had
already
been
accomplished.
and
further,
that
the
lockes
had
indeed
registered
with
the
blm,
so
the
blm
knew
they
were
active
claims
at
the
very
time
that
they
terminated
them.
so
the
purposes
of
the
act
had
been
met.
now,
the
appellants
have
now
apparently
adopted
a
substantial
compliance
standard
here
by
permitting
annual
affidavits
to
be
filed
by
january
19th
if
they
are
postmarked
by
december
30th.
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
would
require
a
december
30th
filing,
and
this
seems
to
be
a
departure
from
the
act's
strict
requirements.
in
view
of
the
nature
of
the
irrebuttable
presumption
that
we
think
this
court
should
rule
on
in
accordance
with
the
vlandis
versus
klein
line
of
cases,
and
in
view
of
the
substantial
compliance
of
the
lockes
with
the
terms
of
the
act,
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
district
court.
and
if
there
are
no
more
questions
by
the
court,
that
concludes
my
presentation.
