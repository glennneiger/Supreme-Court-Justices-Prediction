justice
rehnquist
why
would
it
be
available
under
the
equitable
part
of
the
section,
mr.
nolan?
i
thought
that
common
law
courts
gave
damages,
chancellors
gave
equitable
rulings.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
my
question
remains
why
would
damages
be
available
under
a
section
providing
for
equitable
relief?
justice
rehnquist
sure.
justice
rehnquist
but
is
damages
one
of
the
wide
variety
of
equitable
remedies
that
they
have
used?
justice
rehnquist
and
i
don't
believe
the
respondent
have
cross-petitioned
or
assigned
anything
in
their
brief
that
would
challenge
that
holding.
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
your
opponent
question
that,
do
you
know?
justice
rehnquist
supposing
congress
in
either
a
senate
report
or
a
house
report
says
we
intend
to
provide
the
full
range
of
legal
and
equitable
remedies,
and
then
in
the
statute
itself
you
just
have
a
very
specific
section
that
says
the
plan
shall
have
a
right
to
recover
from
defendants
type
a,
b,
and
c,
nothing
else.
now,
would
that...
would
you
think
that
the
legislative...
statement
in
a
committee
report
would
justify
inferring
a
private
right
of
action
in
the
face
of
statutory
language
like
that?
justice
rehnquist
there
is
also
a
presumption
that
what
congress
had
to
say
was
said
primarily
in
the
statute,
not
in
the
legislative
history,
isn't
there?
justice
rehnquist
marshall
and
elsely.
