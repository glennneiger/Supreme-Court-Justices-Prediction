justice
stevens
but
you
can't
say
that
in
this
case
because
california
law
provides
such
a
remedy.
justice
stevens
yes.
the
ninth
circuit
held
there
was
preemption
here,
didn't
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
notice
one
of
the
petitioners
is
a
person
named
cecilia
steavenson.
who
is
that?
justice
stevens
nothing
to
do
with
the
erisa.
justice
stevens
then
in
the
erisa
claim,
who
is
the
fiduciary,
the
corporation?
justice
stevens
but
you
didn't
sue
them?
justice
stevens
so
your
suit
really
is
not
against
massachusetts
mutual
then.
justice
stevens
well,
say
they
get
five
or
six
people,
whether
employees
or
outside
people,
to
administer
the
plan
and
this
same
sort
of
thing
happened,
they
were
slow
in
making
payments
and
for
whatever
the
reason
might
be,
your
cause
of
action
would
be
against
the
individual
trustees,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question
to
be
sure
i
am
right?
justice
stevens
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
do
not
claim
you
have
any
rights
at
all
against
the
plan.
justice
stevens
so
that
always,
in
all
of
this
class
of
cases,
there
will
always
be
individual
liability
of
the
individual
trustees.
justice
stevens
well,
presumably
you
could...
i
suppose
that
you
might
now,
if
the
employer
is
kind
of
a
third
party
who
breached
the...
compelled
the
trustees
to
violate
their
trust,
maybe
you
have
a
claim
against
him,
but
that
is
not...
the
theory
of
your
case
is
wrongdoing
by
the
trustees
themselves,
and
you...
and
it
is
quite
clear,
you
do
not
seek
to
impose
liability
against
a
plan
for
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
stevens
in
anything
other
than
409,
is
there
anything
else
in
the
statute
that
implies
that
a
beneficiary
under
this
statute
has
a
right
of
action
against
anybody
not
payable
out
of
the
plan?
i
mean,
everything
else
is
in
terms
of
getting
his...
making
sure
he
gets
his
benefits.
justice
stevens
409
is
your
entire
statutory
basis
for
your
position.
justice
stevens
--well,
that
doesn't
follow.
they
could
steal
money
from
the
trust,
and
on
behalf
of
the
plan
you
could
get
remedial
relief
which
might
include
punitive
damages.
i
mean,
if
you
take
your
opponent's
view
of
this
case.
justice
stevens
if
you
say...
i
mean,
but
if
you
read
409
as
just
providing
a
remedy
for
the
plan,
conceivably
a
trustee
could
act
in
a
way
that
would
justify
a
damage
remedy
against
him
which
would
come
within
the
word
remedial.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
about
the
legislative
history?
i
understand
there
is
a
lot
in
the
legislative
history
about
concern
about
the
integrity
of
the
plans
and
misuse
of
assets
and
that
sort
of
thing.
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
congress
was
concerned
with
the
kind
of
problem
you
described,
of
trustees
just
being
slow
in
payment
or
deliberately
withholding
payment
for
some
malicious
reason?
justice
stevens
well,
was
it
an
issue
at
all?
was
it--
justice
stevens
--on
the
question
of
timing,
as
i
understand
the
regulations,
they
do
say
to
you
that
if
they
don't
act
within
three
or
four
months,
i
forget
what
it
is,
you
treat
the
application
as
though
it
had
been
denied,
is
that
right,
so
that
you
may
then
go
into
court
and
get
your
action
against
the
plan.
justice
stevens
so
that
if
you
waited
two
years,
it
would
be
at
the
beneficiary's
option
if
he
had
a
right
to
sue.
he
had
a
right
to
benefits.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
going
back
to
your
compensatory
damages
for
a
minute--
justice
stevens
--the
willful
and
wanton
business
goes
to
punitive
damages.
justice
stevens
but
if
we
put
that
to
one
side
for
a
minute,
i
guess
we
also
have
to
fashion
the
standard
of
reliability
for
prompt
payment,
too,
because
on
the
basic
liability,
your
position
is
they
were
too
slow
in
paying,
and
i
suppose
that
could
be
just
because
they
were
negligent
or
had
sloppy
administration
or
anything.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand.
you
make
the
punitive
damage
claim,
too,
but
your
compensatory
damages,
say
they
just
took
four
months
to
process
your
claim
because
they
had
a
sick
secretary
or
something,
i
suppose
you
would
have
a
compensatory
damage
claim.
justice
stevens
well,
i
have
given
you
the
circumstances.
justice
stevens
it
took
four
months
to
process
your
claim,
and
in
the
meantime
you
couldn't
pay
off
your
mortgage.
justice
stevens
well,
say
eight
months,
say
eight
months.
justice
stevens
we
have
to
decide
what
period
of
time...
basically
we
need
a
national
rule
to
determine
how
slow
a
payment
becomes...
creates
a
compensatory
damage
liability.
justice
stevens
that's
the
120
days,
they
treat
the
claim
as
denied.
justice
stevens
but
do
you
say
that
every
claim
that
takes
more
than
120
days
to
process
gives
rise
to
a
damage
liability?
justice
stevens
but
we
have
to
answer
it
for
the
whole
country.
justice
stevens
well,
is
there
a
defense
to
it,
and
if
so,
what?
