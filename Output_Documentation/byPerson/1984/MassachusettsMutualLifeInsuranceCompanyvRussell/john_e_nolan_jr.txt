mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
under
an
important
federal
statute,
erisa,
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
if
the
statute
was
working
the
way
congress
intended
that
it
should,
the
case
would
not
be
here
today
at
all.
the
respondent
russell
received
all
of
the
benefits
to
which
he
was
entitled
under
the
plan,
under
the
statute,
all
of
the
benefits
that
she
had
claimed
in
march
of
1980,
just
short
of
five
years
ago.
shortly
after
that,
this
suit
was
filed.
it
was
filed
in
state
court.
it
was
removed
to
the
federal
district
court
in
california
where
the
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
petitioners,
ruling
that
punitive
damages
and
extracontractual
compensatory
damages
in
this
case
including
damages
for
pain
and
suffering
and
emotional
distress,
were
not
available
under
erisa.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
they
were,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
first,
with
regard
to
punitive
damages,
that
issue
is
squarely
presented
by
this
case,
whether
or
not
they
are
available
under
erisa.
we
contend
that
they
are
not,
essentially
for
two
reasons,
that
that
is
not
what
congress
said,
and
quite
plainly,
after
review
of
the
legislative
history,
that
is
not
what
congress
intended,
and
secondly,
that
if
punitive
damages
were
available,
they
would
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
employee
benefit
system
in
the
federal
courts.
erisa
is
a
long,
complex,
comprehensive
statute,
but
the
provisions
directly
involved
in
this
case
are
only
two,
and
they
are
relatively
simple.
section
502
provides
that
a
civil
action
is
available
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
to
participants,
beneficiaries
and
fiduciaries
for
relief
under
section
409.
section
409,
which
deals
with
fiduciary
breach,
provides
that
fiduciaries
who
breach
their
duty
will
be
personally
liable
to
the
plan
to
make
good
the
losses
that
their
breach
occasioned
or
to
restore
to
the
plan--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--i
am
suggesting
that,
yes,
justice
brennan.
section
409
deals
with
fiduciary
responsibility,
and
it
talks
about
personal
liability
of
fiduciaries,
but
it
is
our
position
that
recovery
under
409
is
limited
to
the
plan
as
distinguished
from
the
individuals.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
some
of
them
are
defined
explicitly,
justice
brennan,
and
others
are
to
be
inferred
from
the
law
of
trusts
to
which
congress
committed
the
entire
statute
of
erisa
for
its
administration.
409,
in
addition
to
requiring
that
fiduciaries
make
good
to
the
plan
any
loss
occasioned
by
the
breach,
it
requires
that
fiduciaries
restore
to
the
plan
any
gains
that
they
have
made
from
the
use
of
plan
assets.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
the
context
of
erisa,
justice
brennan,
to
be
made
whole
means
to
get
the
benefits
to
which
they
are
entitled
under
the
statute.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
and
that's
all.
and
that--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--well,
under
section
409,
it
is
our
position
that
it
does,
your
honor.
there
are
a
lot
of
provisions
in
erisa.
as
you
know,
it
is
a
very
long
statute,
and
the
liabilities
that
it
establishes
run
in
many
different
ways.
but
409
in
our
view
is
properly
read
to
be
a
safeguard
for
the
plan,
the
plan
assets,
and
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
what
the
four
types
of
plaintiffs
that
are
authorized
to
bring
actions
under
409.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
provision
of
erisa
that
provides
for
individual
rights
for
participants
and
beneficiaries
is
in
502,
specifically
502(a)(1)(b),
and
that
section
which
provides
that
participants
and
beneficiaries
have
the
right
to
enforce
their
benefits
under
the
plan,
to
determine
what
they
are,
to
clarify
their
rights
under
the
plan,
has
its
comparable
provision
referring
to
equitable
remedies
in
section
502(a)(3).
and
when
you
look
at
that,
we
would
suggest
that
you
would
view
that
as
part
of
the
overall
comprehensive
statutory
scheme
where
individual
rights
are
provided
for
there
in
502.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
but
only
to
the
extent
of
the
benefits
of
the
plan.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
other
than
the
equitable
remedies
provided
there,
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case,
and
that
is
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
when
it
enacted
erisa.
it
is
our
position
that
congress
was
enacting
a
benefits
statute,
that
it
was
seeking
to
put
on
the
books
a
statute
which
would
provide
for
certain
minimum
standards,
procedures
and
rules
directed
to
getting
pension
and
welfare
benefits
to
the
people
who
were
entitled
to
them,
that
as
distinguished
from
any
number
of
other
things,
including
the
issues
involved
in
this
case.
it
preempted
state
law.
it
was
not
seeking
to
duplicate
it
or
to
match
it.
it
was
not
providing
a
state--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--to
the
extent
that
it
was
a
state
law
which
related
to
an
employee
benefit
plan,
yes,
it
was
preempted.
now,
i
know
that
this
court
recognizes
that
this
was
not
a
one-way
street,
that
the
benefits
that
participants
and
beneficiaries
receive
under
erisa
are
very,
very
significant.
they
involve
the
vesting
and
the
funding
and
the
access
to
the
courts
and
all
of
the
other
provisions,
review
of
the
detailed
civil
and
criminal
sanctions
that
are
provided,
but
they
necessarily
also
involve
some
trade-offs
and
in
our
view,
a
part
of
those
trade-offs
are
the
state
tort
remedies,
of
which
this
is
a
classic
example.
with
regard
to--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--i
believe
they
would
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
i
think
that
it
probably
would,
justice
o'connor.
to
the
extent
that
it
does
under
title
vii,
for
example,
where
in
actions
like
that
the
party
has
a
right
to
reinstatement
with
or
without
back
pay
and
such
other
equitable
remedies
as
the
court
might
provide,
and
i
think
that
the
reason
that
damages,
whether
they
are
punitive
damages
or
in
this
case
compensatory
damages
for
emotional
distress,
are
at
war
with
this
is
that
they
involve
a
damages
or
legal
concept
outside
of
the
equitable
remedies
provision
of
the
statute.
now,
to
the
extent
that
your
question
goes
to
having
the
fund
or
the
plan
retain
any
losses
that
were
occasioned
by
the
breach,
i
think
that
that
is
very
specifically
provided
by
the
first
two
clauses
of
section
409,
and
that
is
the
make
whole
concept
specifically,
expressly.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
damages,
if
there
were
damages
to
the
plan,
i
think
that
that
might
be
available
under
the
equitable
part
of
the
section.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
that's
generally
true,
that's
generally
true,
justice--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--well,
i
think
in
part
this
is
terminology,
but
to
the
extent
that
it
involves
the
restoration
of
the
plan,
it
would
be
involved,
in
our
view,
under
section
409,
and
the
courts
in
dealing
with
section
409
have
used,
as
this
court
undoubtedly
recognizes--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--a
wide
variety
of
equitable
remedies
to
do
justice.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
it
is
usually
not.
oh,
it
is
always
not
in
the
context
of
409,
and
it
is
usually
not
in
equity
generally.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
key
language,
justice
o'connor,
is
such
other
equitable
or
remedial
relief,
which
ties
that
clause
very
specifically
to
the
two
preceding
clauses.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
read
the
way
respondent
reads
it
here
by
skipping
from
the
authorization
at
the
top
of
section
409
right
down
into
that
language
and
reading
it
as
if
it
read
equitable
relief
or
remedial
relief.
it
is
really
tied
together.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
the
law
of
trusts
is
very
definitely
a
creature
of
equity,
justice
white.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
guess
the
most
significant
point
about
punitive
damages
is
that
they
are
not
mentioned
anywhere,
not
just
in
409,
but
not
mentioned
anywhere
in
erisa.
they
are
not
mentioned
anywhere
in
the
very
extensive
legislative
history
of
erisa.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
there
is
no--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--there
is
nothing
that
i
know
of
in
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
that
would
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
beneficiaries
anything
more
than
their
benefits
under
the
plan.
i
think
that
the
key--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
that--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--congress
said
it
in
the
statute
in
the
preemption
part
of
erisa,
that
any
law
relating
to
employee
benefit
plans
would
be
preempted,
and
that,
of
course,
differentiates
erisa
from
a
number
of
other
federal
statutes
which
intend
expressly
to
leave
state
law
standing.
well,
i
am
still
wondering,
was
there
anything
said
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
that
the
congress
addressed
itself
specifically
to
the
rights
of
beneficiaries
under
ordinary
trust
law
in
the
states?
no,
justice
brennan,
there
was
not.
there
was
much
in
the
legislative
history
on
the
point
that
we
have
been
discussing
just
the
last
couple
of
minutes.
there
is
much
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
over
and
over
and
over
again
that
the
rights
established
in
section
409
are
the
rights
of
the
plan,
not
the
rights
of
individual
beneficiaries.
punitive
damages,
as
i
was
saying,
are
nowhere
mentioned
in
the
statute,
and
that
we
find
particularly
significant
because
it
is
plain
that
when
congress
wants
to
provide
for
punitive
damages,
they
know
exactly
how
to
do
it.
in
the
last
fifty
years
since
enactment
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
in
1934,
and
running
through
tefra
in
1982,
they
have
done
that
in
fourteen
different
statutes.
three
of
those
statutes
were
enacted
in
1974,
the
same
year
that
erisa
was
enacted.
and
that
i
think,
as
this
court
has
recognized
on
other
occasions,
is
very
strong
evidence
that
they
didn't
intend
to
include
punitive
damages
and
then
absentmindedly
overlook
them.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
punitive
damages
as
we
know,
justice
brennan,
are
found
in
many
states,
not
all,
but
many,
and
of
course,
there
was
a
variety
of
state
pension
and
welfare
laws,
and
there
were
actions
under
those
laws,
and
there
were
a
variety
of
results.
that
in
part
was
what
congress
was
driving
at,
again,
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
in
seeking--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--the
variety
of
results,
exactly.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
including
punitive
damages
in
amounts
that
were
arbitrary,
inconsistent,
unreliable,
and
including
as
congress
said
a
uniform
source
of
law
for
evaluating
fiduciary
conduct
which
they
sought
to
establish
in
erisa
which
that
kind
of
system
would
not
provide
for.
i
think
that--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--no.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
was
ever
any
more
than
a
rare
and
occasional
anomaly
of
trust
law.
i
was
referring
to
different
kinds
of
actions
under
state
law
for
wrongful
termination,
cases
like
this
under
state
law,
not
employee
benefits
cases
on
trustees.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
there
are
cases
like
that,
justice
white,
but...
and
we
have
reviewed
that
fairly
carefully,
but
they
are
rare--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--and
they
are
anomalous,
and
actions
by
a
beneficiary
against
a
trustee
are
ill-favored
and
rarely--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
the
ninth
circuit
held
there
was
preemption,
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
i
think
there
is
quite
clearly
preemption
in
this
case.
this
case
deals--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
that
our
opponent
does.
i
would
like
to
return
again
to
the
comprehensive
legislative
scheme
that
is
erisa,
because
i
think
that
that
is
perhaps
the
most
persuasive
single
reason
for
this
court
holding
that
punitive
damages
are
not
available
here.
as
this
court
said
in
the
northwest
air
lines
case,
where
a
statute
is
comprehensive...
and
erisa
is
among
the
most
comprehensive
statutes...
and
where
it
provides
for
private
remedies
in
some
situations,
and
federal
government
remedies
in
other
situations,
that
is
very
strong
evidence
that
it
didn't
intend
that
additional
remedies
should
be
grafted
on
to
a
statute
like
that.
the
review
of
erisa
is
convincing
indeed.
its
civil
and
criminal
penalties
and
sanctions
providing
for
imprisonment,
fines
in
various
amounts
for
various
kinds
of
conduct,
one
would
have
to
conclude
that
congress
reviewed
the
subject
that
they
had
under
consideration
exhaustively
and
in
great
detail,
and
unlike
some
other
statutes
which
do
involve
filling
in
the
details
by
courts,
this
is
not
that
case.
this
is
a
very
specific,
very
comprehensive
act
directed
to
providing
minimum
standards
for
pensioners
and
benefits
for
those
entitled
to
them
on
a
nationwide
basis,
and
the
emphasis
is
on
the
delivery
of
those
benefits
rather
than
on
state
tort
claims
which
may
be
associated
with
the
subject
matter
of
earlier
cases
or
like
this
case.
we
contend
also
that
punitive
damages,
if
they
were
available,
would
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
functioning
of
the
employee
benefit
system
and
in
fact,
the
federal
courts.
the
congress
very
carefully
provided
in
the
statute
and
by
regulation
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
labor
for
an
appeals
process
in
the
event
that
a
claim
is
denied,
and
that
that
appeals
process
would
effectively
be
scrapped
if
the
right
to
damages
were
available
to
those
who
were
applying
for
them.
who
will
go
through
the
appeals
process
if
he
had
a
right
to
damages
for
emotional
distress,
pain
and
suffering,
and
particularly
if
he
had
a
right
to
punitive
damages
on
the
outside?
this
case
is
probably
as
good
an
example
of
that
as
any.
we
have
talked
about
the
remedial
aspect
of
the
statute
and
how
that
works
with
the
individual
rights
provided
under
section
502
and
the
plan
rights
provided
in
section
409.
i
would
be
glad
to
respond
to
any
questions
that
any
justice
might
have,
or
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
times
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
i
have
four
very
brief
points,
your
honor.
there
have
been
a
number
of
questions
dealing
with
preemption
and
state
remedies
in
my
argument
and
in
my
opponent's,
and
that
is
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
8
and
9,
the
rationale
for
it.
congress
essentially
said
that
the
fiduciary
standard
embodied
in
federal
legislation
is
considered
desirable
because
it
will
bring
a
measure
of
uniformity
in
an
area
where
decisions
under
the
same
set
of
facts
may
vary
from
state
to
state.
it
is
evident
that
the
operations
of
employee
benefit
plans
are
increasingly
interstate.
the
uniformity
of
decision
which
the
act
is
designed
to
foster
will
help
administrators,
fiduciaries
and
participants
to
predict
the
legality
of
proposed
actions
without
the
necessity
of
reference
to
varying
state
laws,
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
fundamental,
core
to
this
case
and
to
the
issues
that
we
have
discussed
here.
there
have
been
a
number
of
questions
about
making
the
plan
whole
from
justice
o'connor
and
justice
white
and
others,
and
there
is
a
case
that
deals
with
that,
a
federal
case
that
deals
with
that
that
i
would
commend
to
the
court.
it
is
called
froyen
v.
marshall
and
eisley.
it
is
a
wisconsin
case
decided
in
1971
and
found
at
485
fed.
sup.
629.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
and...
elsely,
is
it?
it
says
that
the
court
has
broad
discretion
in
awarding
equitable
relief
to
make
the
plan
whole,
and
i
think
that
responds
to
what
happens
if
the
fiduciary
takes
something
and
goes
away,
and
whether
you
call
it
damages
or
not
is
an
issue.
i
think
that
erisa,
it
would
be
regarded
as
equitable
relief
as
distinguished
from
damages,
but
the
effect
of
it
would
be
to
restore
the
plan,
to
make
the
plan
whole.
there
have
been
a
few
cases
that
have
gone
the
other
way
on
our
issue,
by
our
count,
about
a
half
a
dozen,
and
fifteen
resolve
it
the
way
we
recommend
to
the
court.
the
interesting
thing
about
the
six
is
that
they
all
ride
the
same
horse.
they
all
take
the
same
line
from
the
legislative
history,
the
line
that
refers
to
the
full
range
of
legal
and
equitable
relief,
and
which
is
repeated
in
the
house
and
senate
reports,
and
they
use
that
as
the
basis
for
the
decision.
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
an
insubstantial
basis,
particularly
where
the
bill
was
amended
going
through,
and
that
reference
which
may
have
been
accurate
when
the
legislative
history
was
written,
was
stripped
from
the
bill
before
it
was
enacted,
and
there
is
in
the
present
bill
no
reference
at
all
to
legal
relief,
and
we
would
suggest
therefore
no
reference
at
all
to
the
kind
of
damages
relief
raised
by
respondents
here.
justice
o'connor
had
a
question
about
502(a)(3),
would
it
give
participants
or
beneficiaries
a
right
against
fiduciaries.
in
our
view,
it
would.
if
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
would
be
glad
to
respond.
justice
white?
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
the
claim
in
this
case
is
that
the
participant,
i
believe,
should
get
punitive
damages,
yes.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
rather
than
the
plan,
clearly.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
there
are
two
aspects
to
that
which
make
it
good
as
a
hypothetical
but
not
very
good
as
a
case.
the
first
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
go
through
409,
you
go
through
502(a)(2),
i
believe,
which
has
a
specific
reference
to
409.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
the
other
is
that
502(a)(3)
is
by
its
terms
expressly
limited
to
equitable
relief.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
it
is
in
our
view
by
the
individual
as
to--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--i
believe
that--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--that's
correct.
