justice
jr.
are
you
suggestion,
mr.
nolan,
that
under
409
the
duties
imposed
run
only
for
the
plan,
not
for
beneficiaries?
justice
jr.
now,
it
talks
about
duties
imposed
upon
fiduciaries
by
this
subchapter.
what
are
they?
justice
jr.
well,
didn't
trust
law
generally
provide
for
recognizing
that
a
beneficiary
should
be
made
whole?
you
just
suggested,
i
think,
that
congress
delegated
to
the
law
of
trusts
much
of
what
erisa
was
intended
to
accomplish.
justice
jr.
the
beneficiaries
under
the
old
law
were
always
entitled
to
be
made
whole.
justice
jr.
and
that's
all.
justice
jr.
and
anything
else
has
to
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
plan
only.
justice
jr.
well,
and
i
can't...
there's
nothing
else
in
erisa
you
suggest
that
could
be
read
as
providing
for
something
more
to
beneficiaries
than
what
the
plan
provides
for
them
in
the
way
of
benefits?
justice
jr.
but
only
to
the
extend
of
the
benefits
that
the
plan
provides.
justice
jr.
and
there
is
no
remedy
for
beneficiaries,
for
something
more
anywhere
else?
justice
jr.
well,
where
state
law
previously
may
have
provided
beneficiaries
with
a
remedy
for
more
than
just
the
benefits
under
the
plan,
was
that
too
preempted?
justice
jr.
well,
at
the
same
time,
mr.
nolan,
is
there
mention
in
the
discussions
in
the
legislative
history
of
preemption
of
state
remedies,
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
any
that
gave
more
than
just...
beneficiaries
more
than
just
the
benefits
of
the
plan?
justice
jr.
did
congress
say
that
explicitly?
justice
jr.
no,
what...
no,
my
question
was
whether
in
saying
this
congress
also
said,
and
to
the
extent
beneficiaries
had
any
right
to
anything
else
under
state
law
no
longer,
get
only
what
erisa
provides.
justice
jr.
did
congress
say
that
expressly?
justice
jr.
were
there
any
states
that
allowed
a
beneficiary
to
recover
punitive
damages
before
erisa
was
enacted?
justice
jr.
and
the
variety
of
results
in
some
instances--
justice
jr.
--included
punitive
damages.
justice
jr.
then
you
do
agree
that
all
state
law
was
preempted
by
erisa.
justice
jr.
have
there
been
many
states
that
allowed
punitive
damages
in
suits
by
beneficiaries
against
fiduciaries?
justice
jr.
punitive
damages?
justice
jr.
well,
a
fiduciary
who
faces
the
possibility
of
punitive
damages
hasn't
much
incentive,
has
he,
to
accept
the
job?
