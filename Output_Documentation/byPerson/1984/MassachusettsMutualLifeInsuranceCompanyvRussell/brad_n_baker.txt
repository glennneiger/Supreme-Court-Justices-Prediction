mr.
brad
n.
baker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
erisa
was
enacted
to
protect
participants
from
actions
of
the
small
percentage
of
fiduciaries
who
were
not
acting
in
good
faith
and
were
not
providing
the
benefits
that
participants
were
rightfully
entitled
to.
respondent
at
this
time
does
not
request
the
court
to
imply
remedies
into
erisa
but
to
interpret
the
language
that
is
in
erisa
right
now
in
light
of
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
language.
it
is
the
traditional
role
of
this
court
to
analyze
the
statute,
and
that's
what
i
wish
to
do
for
you
at
this
particular
point.
in
the
purpose
of
erisa,
it
indicates
that
erisa
was
created
to
protect
participants
and
to
provide
appropriate
remedies,
sanctions
and
ready
access
to
the
federal
court.
the
legislative
history
of
both
the
house
and
the
senate
is
unambiguous
and
quite
clear,
and
it
states
that
the
enforcement
provisions
were
created
and
specifically
designed
to
provide
broad
remedies
for
participants
to
redress
or
prevent
violations
of
the
act.
it
then
goes
on
and
says
it
is
the
committee's
intent
to
provide
the
full
range
of
legal
and
equitable
remedies,
and
in
both...
available
both
in
state
and
federal
courts.
now,
at
the
time
that
this
specific
legislative
intent
created
a
full
range
of
legal
and
equitable
remedies
for
participants,
it
was
quite
clear
that
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
were
part
of
the
full
range
of
legal
remedies
available
to
participants.
the
section
502...
excuse
me...
(a)(2)
language
which
refers
over
to
section
409
allows
participants
equitable
or
remedial
relief
as
the
court
deems
appropriate,
and
this
is
for
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty.
traditionally,
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty
are
a
tort.
it
is
not
founded
in
trust
law,
but
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
a
tort.
if
you
look
at
the
erisa
the
way
it
is
set
up,
section
502
provides
for
remedies
against
the
plan.
section
409
sets
forth
the
tort
remedies
against
the
fiduciary.
the
preemption
which
totally
occupied
the
field
and
removed
many
tort
remedies,
intentional
torts
as
well
as
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
torts,
completely
wiped
the
slate
clean.
it
would
be
anomalous
at
this
particular
point
to
so
narrowly
construe
section
409
as
to
not
provide
the
teeth
in
erisa
necessary
to
fill
that
void,
that
preemption.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
every
court
including
yourself
in
shaw
v.
delta
air
lines,
seems
to
be
taking
that
position.
our
position
in
the
ninth
circuit
was
certain
torts
should
not
be
preempted.
however--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--in
the
restatement
of
torts,
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
a
tort,
and
it
cites
many
cases
from
differing
jurisdictions
in
california
all
the
way,
and
since
1908
they
have
allowed--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--punitive
damages,
compensatory
damages,
the
full
range
of
whatever
you
can
get
under
a
tort
against
the
fiduciary.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
i
believe
you
are
referring
to
the...
all
the
amicus
briefs
on
behalf
of
the
taft-hartley
plans
where
you
have
half
of
the
fiduciaries
from
the
employers
and
half
from
the
employees.
you
have
got
some
checks
and
balances
and
safeguards
there
that
themselves
would
immunize
the
fiduciaries
from
punitive
damages.
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
context
where
we
are
right
now,
that
the
administration
of
welfare
plans
under
section
405(c)(1)
and
(2),
these
fiduciaries
may
allocate
their
responsibilities
and
obligations
for
nontrust
asset
type
decisions,
and
if
they
adequately
in
fact
do
delegate
their
authority,
they
are
immune
from
liability,
so
that
trustees
who
are
sitting
on
the
plans
to
make
sure
that
the
trust
assets
are
being
governed
and
that
the
policies
themselves
are
being
established
properly,
they
will
not
be
affected
unless
they
are
in
there
actually
working
on
a
day-to-day
basis
exhibiting
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
a
participant
should
or
should
not
receive
a
benefit.
so
those
obligations
can
be
delegated
to
professionals
who,
just
like
insurance,
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the...
any
participant
who
happens
to
be
receiving
benefits
pursuant
to
an
insurance
administered
plan,
do
have
the
full
range
of
remedies
in
state
law
for
their
protection,
compensatory
damages,
punitive
damages.
the
particular
situation
we
are
in
right
now
is
a
self-funded,
self-administered
plan
that
if
the
benefits
are
not
paid,
the
direct
benefit
accrues
to
the
employer
who
is
administering
the
plan.
it
is
a
total
conflict
situation,
and
it
was
these
types
of
breaches
that
erisa
was
created
to
prevent.
and
we
are
not
talking
about
wholesale...
wholesale
poor
actions
by
fiduciaries.
this
is
a
small
percentage
of
fiduciaries
who
need
to
be
kept
in
line.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
that
is
the
supervisor.
she
was
named
not
with
regards
to
erisa
but--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--nothing
to
do
with
erisa.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
in
the
particular
plan,
we
did
not
name
the
fiduciaries
because
we
sued
the
plan.
we
should
have
been
suing
the
fiduciaries.
the
fiduciaries
were
long-time
company
employees.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
we
have
an
amendment
before
the
court
to
amend
the
complaint
to
sue
them
at
this
particular
point.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
massachusetts
mutual,
because
they
exhibit
or
they
have
control
over
the
employees
and
are
acting
in
a
discretionary
manner
in
setting
up
the
policies
of
erisa,
could
conceivably
be
a
fiduciary,
and
we
contend
that
they
are
a
fiduciary
under
the
definition
of
fiduciary.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
that
is
correct,
unless
there
can
be
proven
that
the
company
itself
is
exerting
such
influence
over
these
people
and
they
have
not
allocated
their
duties
pursuant
to
405(c)(1)
and
(c)(2).
if
employers
allocate
their
duties
properly
and
truly
do
have
independent
people
administering
the
plans,
then
they
will
be
exempt
from
liability
for
these
types
of
damages,
compensatory
or
punitive.
the
legislative
history
or
the
legislative
intent
is
quite
clear
that
the
whole
range
of
legal
and
equitable
remedies
are
available
to
participants.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
looking
at
the
language
of
section
409,
you
have
an
equitable
or
remedial
relief
in
there,
and
the
opposite--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--no
federal
court
has
ever
taken
that
position,
even
the
cases--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--with
regards
to
an
earlier
senate
version
that
petitioners
contend
cast
aspersions
upon
the
intent
of
congress
since
that
earlier
version
was
not
adopted,
and
the
earlier
version
had
the
words
"civil
action
for
legal
or
equitable
relief
can
be
granted
to
participants.
"
the...
that
was
a
section
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
and
that
was
the
senate
version
under
s.
4
at
section
693.
that
language
there
specifically
lines
up
with
the
language
of
409
such
that
the
only
consistent
reading
you
can
have,
looking
at
the
legislative
intent
along
with
an
earlier
version,
and
what
you
actually
end
up
with
under
409--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--that
is
correct.
in
fact,
when
the
house
of
representatives
committee
said
that
they
intended
to
provide
the
full
range
of
legal
and
equitable
remedies,
the
precise
language
that
is
in
erisa
now
was
before
them.
it
was
the
original
version
of
the
statute
that
was
before
the
committee
when
the
committee
said
it
is
our
intent
to
provide
the
full
range.
if
it
is
not
provided
under
section
409,
there
is
no
other
provision
in
erisa
which
would
allow
legal
remedies.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
the
definition
of
remedial
is
quite...
it
is
a
very
nebulous
definition.
it
can
mean
punitive,
compensatory,
whatever
it
takes
to
remedy
the
wrong
that
is
perceived.
so--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--that
is
correct.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
at
that
particular
point,
a
tribal
right
of
action
argument
would
indicate
that
the
statute
was
specifically
provided,
the
benefit
of
that
statute
was
for
participants.
state
law
has
completely
preempted
all
state
causes
of
action
therefore
making
it
a
federal
concern,
and
there
should
be
an
implied
remedy
for
the
participants.
there
they
would
be...
they
would
also,
if
you
do
not--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--absent
specific
legislative
intent,
and
the
legislative
intent
here
by
both
the
house
and
the
senate
was
to
provide
the
full
rage
of
legal
and
equitable
remedies,
and
if
you
do
not
read
remedial
to
mean
legal,
then
there
have
been
no
legal
remedies
afforded
to
the
participants.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
if
in
fact...
no,
there
is
a
presumption
you
do
not
want
to
create
a
private
right
of
action,
and
i--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--also
correct.
the--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--that
is
correct.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
under
section
409
or
under
section
502,
or
both?
mr.
brad
n.
baker
section
502
says
against
the
plan
you
can
only
sue
for
equitable
relief
or
benefits,
and
the
purpose
of
that
was
because
you
don't
want
to...
you
do
not
want
to
jeopardize
the
assets
of
the
plan
which
would
then
jeopardize
all
beneficiaries.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
correct.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
except
that
under
502
they
specifically
say
for
appropriate
relief,
the
participants
or
beneficiaries
may
sue
for
appropriate
relief
under
section
409.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
that's
a--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--no,
not
at
all.
those
are
remedies
that
are
available
against
the
plan
under
section
502.
you
must
refer
it
over
to
section
409
to
find
out
the
remedies
against
a
fiduciary.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
i
believe
that
if
it
is
read
in
conjunction
with
a
participant
or
beneficiary
going
to
502(a)
says
a
participant
or
beneficiary
may
sue
for
appropriate
relief
under
section
409,
you
then
get
referred
over
to
section
409,
and
it
says
that
the
participant
may
receive
other
equitable
or
remedial
relief--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
so
the
question
before
the
court
is
how
to
interpret
the
word
"remedial".
does
it
mean
just
equitable?
mr.
brad
n.
baker
certainly.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
most
certainly.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
of
the
individual
trustees
unless
an
employer
puts
himself
in
a
conflict
situation
and
is
actually
administering
a
self-funded
plan
so
that
an
employer
becomes
a
fiduciary.
but
then
he
will
still
be
sued
in
his
fiduciary
capacity.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
not
at
all.
that
would
defeat
one
of
the
major
purposes
of
erisa
to
maintain
the
economic
integrity
of
the
plan.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
409.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
that's
it.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
okay.
traditionally
equitable
relief
does
not
include
compensatory
or
punitive
damages,
and
it
seems
to
be
a
consistent
reading
of
the
statute
that
you
can
only
get
equitable
relief
or
your
benefits
from
the
plan,
which
is
502.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
502(a)--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--(a)(3)
does
not
give
any
right
against
a
fiduciary.
409
is
the
only
right
that
a
beneficiary
participant
has
to
sue
a
fiduciary.
the...
if
in
fact
remedial
means
just
equitable,
as
must
be
the
court's
finding
in
order
to
determine
that
no
compensatory
or
punitive
damages
are
allowed
against
fiduciaries,
then
you
have
created
in
essence
an
immunization
of
fiduciaries.
they
cannot
be
sued
for
compensatory
or
punitive
damages
no
matter
how
willful
or
malicious
their
conduct
is.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
i
am
not
certainly
what
my
opponent--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--that
is
correct.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
that
is
correct.
it
is
not...
the
other
equitable
or
remedial
relief
is
not
just
provided
for
the
benefits.
the
plan
also
could--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--against
fiduciaries
receive
other
equitable
or
remedial
relief.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
intent
or
the
legislative
scheme
that
in
any
way
indicates
that
they
want
to
protect
fiduciaries
for
willful,
malicious
actions
against
plan
participants.
in
fact,
just
the
opposite
is
true,
you
have
been
set
up
strict
standards
for
fiduciaries
and
personal
liability.
the
balancing
of
costs
argument
the
petitioners
have
advanced,
the
costs
that
congress,
when
reading
the
legislative
history,
the
costs
that
they
were
referring
to
were
not
the
administration
costs,
the
day
in,
day
out.
that
did
not
change
that
much
when
erisa
was
enacted.
the
true
costs
were
the
vesting
and
the
accrual
rates,
and
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
when
erisa
was
established,
it
did
not
put
such
a
financial
burden
on
the
employers
with
regards
to
making
employees
vested
100
percent
on
day
one
and
have
a
100
percent
accrued
benefit.
that
is
the
cost
analysis.
if
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
are
allowed
under
section
409,
these
will
not
be
costs
that
will
be
borne
by
the
employer.
these
are
against
the
fiduciaries
themselves.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
once
you
expand
beyond
equitable
into
legal,
the
facts
of
the
case
will
control
and
the
standard
of
review
will
determine
whether
compensatory
or
punitive
damages
should
be
allowed
against
the
fiduciary.
i
do
not
draw
a
distinction
of
compensatory
or
punitive
damages,
if
the
situation
warrants,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
said,
and
there
should
be
a
very
narrow
definition
that
only
willful
misconduct
or
wanton
disregard
of
participants'
rights
would--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--traditionally,
yes.
however,
usually
it
is
when
there
is
such
unambiguous
congressional
intent
to
protect
participants
and
provide
the
full
range
of
legal
and
equitable
remedies.
once
again,
that
will
help
interpret
the
word
"remedial",
and
it
is
a
remedial
statute.
it
is
either
a
remedial
statute
that
expands
the
rights
of
participants,
or
it
is
a
remedial
statute
that
restricts
the
right
of
participants.
all
the
way
through
the
legislative
history,
erisa
is
something
that
expands
the
rights
of
participants.
nowhere
does
it
state
we
are
restricting
participants'
rights,
or
participants
are
forfeiting
rights
they
already
had
under
state
law
for
the
benefit
of
the
common
good,
and
the
benefit
of
the
common
good
in
this
particular
situation
would
be
the
immunization
of
fiduciaries.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
the
fiduciaries
should
be
put
in
an
immunized
position,
or
that
they
should
be
a
favored
type
of
class.
i
know
of,
personally
know
of
no
type
of
statute
that
as
a
class
protects
an
individual
group
of
people
from
willful,
malicious
conduct,
especially
when
that
person
is
supposed
to
be
acting
on
behalf
of
participants.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
respondent's
position
is
that
compensatory...
you
can't
get
anything--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--all
you
get
are
just
your
benefits.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
only
from
the
plan,
that
if
in
fact
your
welfare
or
your
disability
payments
are
chopped
off
for
two
years
and
you
lose
your
house
and
they
turn
around
and
give
you
your
two
years
worth
of
back
disability
payments,
you
cannot
receive
compensation
for
an
erroneous
act
by
a
fiduciary
that
cost
you
your
house
or
that
might
have
been
a
spiteful
action.
fiduciaries
are
completely
immunized
under
petitioners
position.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
they
really
spend
very
little
time
on
the
remedies.
i
think
that
that
was
not
a
key
issue.
they
presumed--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--it
was
not
discussed
one
way
or
the
other.
they
did
not
say
we
are
picking
one
set
of
remedies
over
another
set
of
remedies.
they
said
they
wanted
the
full
range
of
legal
and
equitable,
and
the
full
range--
mr.
brad
n.

--with
regards
to
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
that
is
correct.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
that
is
correct.
respondent's
position
is
not
that
the
administrative
remedies
section
should
be
removed.
petitioners'
argument
that
the
internal
resolution
of
plans
will
go
completely
out
the
window
if
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
are
awarded
does
not
follow.
if
in
fact
you
must
or
the
participants
still
must
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies
before
they
can
sue,
if
the
fiduciaries
reverse
their
position
and
make
payments
within
that
period
of
time,
that
is
the
best
evidence
as
to
good
faith
which
would
immunize
them
from
compensatory
or
punitive
damages.
the
petitioners
also
indicate
that
there
is
a
trade-off
going
here,
that
there
is...
because
the
participants
receive
certain
rights
under
erisa,
they
have
to
give
up
something
else.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
or
any
case
law
that
has
been
cited
that
takes
that
position.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
is
a
remedy
to
redress
or
prevent
violations
of
the
act.
it
is
true
that
punitive
damages
are
a
great
preventative
deterrent
tool.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
it
is
more
of
a
deterrence
to
others.
i
think
that
we
are
not
arguing
here
whether
punitive
damages
are
in
society
or
not.
you
discussed
that
in
smith
v.
wade.
the
standard
for
punitive
damages
i
concede
should
be
high.
i
think
it
should
be
the
one
enumerated
by
the
ninth
circuit,
that
only
for
willful,
malicious
misconduct
or
for
wanton
disregard
or
indifference
towards
the
rights
of
participants.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
you
cannot
get
that
from
erisa.
however,
erisa
in
the
legislative
history
indicated
that
they
wanted
a
body
of
federal
common
law
to
be
established
to
fill
the
void
created
by
the
complete
preemption
of
all
state
laws.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
well,
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
however,
it
is
the
court's
ability
at
this
particular
point
to
set
the
uniform
standard
for
punitive
damages
under
erisa.
nowhere
does
it
state
that
state
law
must
be
followed.
in
fact,
state
law
will
not
be
followed.
it
is
for
federal
common
law
to
be
established
to
fill
the
void
created
by
the
total
preemption,
and
the
standard
that
has
been
established
by
the
ninth
circuit
is
a
willful
wantonness
standard.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
i
do
not
feel
that
a
mere
reckless
standard
would
be
appropriate
in
this
situation.
i
think
it
should
be
a
willful
standard.
it
would
be
anomalous
at
this
particular
point
to
completely
wipe
out
all
remedies
that
participants
had
under
state
law.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
surely.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
that
is
correct.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
our
particular
case
does
not
just
deal
with
slow
payment.
it--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--under
certain
circumstances,
if
the--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--you
see,
the
four
month
period
is
still--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--that
is
still
within
the
26--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--eight
months,
yes.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
there
is
a
standard
that
has
been
set
forth
already
in
the
regulations,
and
that
is
regulation
2560.503.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
it
goes
on
just
denied.
if
no
response
is
made,
you
may
treat
it
as
denied
for
the
purposes
of
exhausting
your
administrative
remedies.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
mr.
brad
n.
baker
i
think
it
sets
up
a
presumption,
yes,
that--
mr.
brad
n.
baker
--reasonable
cause.
