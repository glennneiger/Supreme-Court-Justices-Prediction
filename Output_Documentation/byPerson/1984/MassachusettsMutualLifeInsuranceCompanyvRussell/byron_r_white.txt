justice
white
well,
isn't
the
law
of
trusts
historically
a
creature
of
equity?
justice
white
and
suits
against
trustees
raise
equitable
questions.
justice
white
well,
are
you
saying
that
it
was
a
regular
feature
of
trust
law
in
one
or
more
states
or
a
lot
of
states
that
would
award
punitive
damages
in
connection
with
suits
against
trustees
who
have
stolen
from
the
fund
or
who
engaged
in
some
kind
of
conduct?
can
you--
justice
white
--as
well
as
just
surcharging
them,
would
they
award
punitive
damages
as
part
of
trust
law?
justice
white
so
you
would
say
even
if
there
was
no
preemption,
there
is
no
basis
for
awarding
punitive
damages
against
a
trustee.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
well,
why...
congress
did
provide
for
a
participant
or
a
beneficiary
to
have
a...
to
be
able
to
sue.
justice
white
but
it
rather
carefully
said
what
he
could
sue
for.
justice
white
502.
justice
white
no,
i
know,
but
congress
did
provide
for
a
civil
action
by
participants
or
beneficiaries.
justice
white
and
said
what
they
could
sue
for.
this
is
just
another
argument,
perhaps
congress
didn't
intend
participants
and
beneficiaries
to
have
any
other
kind
of
a
cause
of
action.
justice
white
to
enjoin
any
act
or
practice
which
violates
any
provision
of
this
title
or
the
terms
of
the
plan,
or
to
obtain
other
appropriate
equitable
relief,
to
redress
such
violations,
or
to
enforce
any
provision.
justice
white
do
you
think
punitive
damages
falls
within
those
words?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
section
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
participant
or
a
beneficiary
suing.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
well,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
you
can't
get
compensatory
damages
against
a
defaulting
trustee,
is
there?
justice
white
you
can't
get
anything.
justice
white
and
that
would
be
you
would
get
them
from
the
plan
or
not?
justice
white
so
i
guess
your
argument
really
boils
down
to
it
that
punitive
damages
is
a
form
of
remedy.
justice
white
well,
is
that
a
remedy
to
a
plaintiff?
or
a
deterrence
to
others?
justice
white
is
there...
is
the
claim
in
this
case
that
the
beneficiary
should
get
punitive
damages?
justice
white
and
not...
rather
than
the
plan.
justice
white
what
if
the
beneficiary
sues
under
(3)(a)(2)
for
appropriate
relief
under
section
409?
i
understand
your
position
is
that
all
recoveries
under
409
go
to
the
plan.
justice
white
and
part
of
his
cause
of
action
is
i
am
suing
on
behalf
of
the
plan
to
get
relief
against
this
fiduciary,
and
i
want
the
fiduciary
to
pay
punitive
damages
to
the
plan.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that.
502(a)(2)
permits
the
participant
to
sue
for
appropriate
relief
under
409,
i
think.
justice
white
that's
just
what
it
says.
it
says
a
beneficiary
may
sue
for
appropriate
relief
under
section
409,
and
you
say
the
only
appropriate
relief
would
have
to
be
paid
to
the
plan,
and
you
also
say
that
in
any
event,
punitive
damages
is
never
appropriate
relief.
justice
white
okay.
