justice
o'connor
mr.
nolan,
if
the
plaintiff
below
has
been
someone
suing
on
behalf
of
the
plan,
would
compensatory
damages
be
available
under
409?
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
language
speaking
of
other
equitable
or
remedial
relief
as
the
court
may
deem
appropriate
as
applied
to
a
suit
by
the
plan
might
result
in
a
difference,
might
it
not?
justice
o'connor
or
there
might
be
consequential
damages
beyond
mere
reimbursement
of
the
amounts
due.
justice
o'connor
and
it
could
be
other
remedial
relief,
in
any
event.
justice
o'connor
well,
despite
the
language
in
the
legislative
history,
congress
nevertheless
enacted
a
very
specific
series
of
remedies
and
didn't
incorporate
expressly
any
provision
for
a
beneficiary
to
obtain
punitive
or
extracontractual
compensatory
relief,
and
our
normal
presumption,
is
it
not,
in
those
circumstances,
would
be
not
to
read
into
the
act
additional
remedies.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
looking
at
409,
it
does
appear
to
be
addressed
to
relief
for
the
plan
itself,
not
a
beneficiary.
justice
o'connor
well,
reading
the
language
of
it,
at
least,
that's
what
one
would
normally
think
it
meant.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
earlier
version,
of
course,
wasn't
adopted.
justice
o'connor
but
that
might
mean
congress
didn't
provide
for
any,
and
that
gets
down
to
the
question
i
asked
you.
our
normal
presumption
would
be
that
we
don't
read
in
additional
remedies
that
congress
did
not
provide
for.
justice
o'connor
well,
again,
that
makes
the
assumption
that
409
is
addressed
to
remedies
of
the
beneficiary
as
opposed
to
the
plan.
justice
o'connor
now,
assuming
we
think
it
applies
only
to
the
plan,
then
where
are
we?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
brings
you
to
transamerica
mortgage
advisors,
to
shaw
v.
delta
air
lines,
to
cases
where
we
have
not
implied
additional
remedies.
justice
o'connor
well,
how
about
502(a)(3),
which
gives
a...
the
authority
for
a
civil
action
to
be
brought
by
a
beneficiary
to
obtain
"other
appropriate
equitable
relief"?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
read
502(a)(3)
as
giving
a
cause
of
action
to
a
beneficiary
against
a
trustee?
justice
o'connor
(a)(3)--
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
there
is
any
difference
at
all
for
purposes
of
your
argument
in
reading
the
statute
to
give
you
relief
and
punitive
damages
as
opposed
to
compensatory,
noncontractual
damages?
is
one
more
difficult
to
find
than
the
other?
justice
o'connor
has
this
court
been
more
reluctant
to
find
punitive
damages
authorization
than
compensatory,
in
your
view?
