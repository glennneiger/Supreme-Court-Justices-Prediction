justice
marshall
so
the
question
that
he
didn't
know
much
about
guns,
but
he
did
shoot
the
man
through
the
heart,
didn't
he?
justice
marshall
i'm
only
getting
to
your
one
point
that
you've
been
making,
that
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
guns.
justice
marshall
the
story
is
that
this
man
admitted
that
he,
one,
he
carried
a
gun
that
day,
the
purpose
for
which
he
carried
it,
and
that
he
kept
it
cocked.
now,
if
you
carry
a
cocked
gun,
it's
awful
hard
to
persuade
me
that
you
didn't
mean
to
shoot
him.
otherwise,
why
cock
it?
justice
marshall
well,
in
the
dark,
the
people
can't
see
whether
it's
cocked
or
not,
can
they?
justice
marshall
one
other
problem
i
have.
do
you
recognize
the
difference
in
the
statement
that
"i
pulled
the
trigger"
and
that
"i
deliberately
shot
him"?
justice
marshall
one
is,
it
could
be
accidental,
couldn't
it?
justice
marshall
but
you
say
you
pulled
the
trigger.
can
you
accidentally
pull
a
trigger?
