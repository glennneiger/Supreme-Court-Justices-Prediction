mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
address
first
the
issue
of
whether
this
charge
was
unconstitutional
under
sandstrom,
and
later
cover
the
harmless
error
point.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
eleventh
circuit
panel
that
decided
this
case
included
judge
hill
who
was
on
the
panel
which
decided
the
corn
case
which
you
have
been
hearing
so
much
about.
i
believe
that
this
indicates
that
while
the
eleventh
circuit
does
have
numerous
cases
involving
sandstrom
errors
and
alleged
sandstrom
errors,
they
are
perfectly
capable
of
not
adopting
some
bright
line
test.
they
are
capable
of
looking
carefully
at
the
charge
as
a
whole
and
deciding
whether
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
been
misled
by
that
into
effectively
shifting
the
burden
of
persuasion.
and
i
would
also
indicate
that
sandstrom
itself
makes
clear
that
although
it's
possible
that
reasonable
jurors
could
view
the
charge
in
different
ways,
that
the
facts
that
you
must
look
at
it
is
that
if
one
of
those
ways
in
which
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
construed
the
charge
is
an
unconstitutional
way
that
shifts
the
burden
of
proof,
the
mere
fact
that
other
reasonable
jurors
might
have
interpreted
differently
does
not
make
the
charge
constitutional.
and
that
is
squarely
indicated
in
the
sandstrom
holding
itself,
and
the
state's
position
to
the
contrary
ignores
sandstrom.
now,
looking
at
the
charge
in
this
case,
the
jury
was
first
told
as
a
precursor
to
these
charges
that
they
were
about
to
hear
legal
definitions
from
the
georgia
criminal
code.
and
then,
in
language
very
reminiscent
of
the
sandstrom
case's
language,
they
were
told
that
acts
of
person
of
a
sound
mind
and
discretion
are
presumed
to
be
the
product
of
the
person's
will,
and
that
a
person
of
sound
mind
and
discretion
is
presumed
to
intend
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
of
his
acts.
in
sandstrom,
those
presumptions
were
held
unconstitutional
under
either
of
two
possible
interpretations.
the
first
was
that
this
was
an
irrebutable
conclusive
presumption.
but
the
second
one
is
that
it
was
a
rebuttable
mandatory
presumption,
and
that
second
interpretation
is
the
one
that
applies
here.
presumption
that
the
jury
is
required
to
use
unless
it
is
rebutted
is
unconstitutional
under
sanstrom,
unless,
as
never
occurred
here,
the
jury
is
told
by
what
quantum
of
evidence
the
presumption
must
be
rebutted.
sandstrom
held
that
that
kind
of
presumption
is
unconstitutional
because
a
reasonable
juror
might
construe
it
as
requiring
considerably
more
than
some
evidence
to
rebut
it;
therefore,
had
the
effect
of
shifting
the
burden
of
persuasion.
the
same
constitutional
problem
is
present
here
because
the
jury
was
given
what
were
billed
as
legal
definitions,
and
was
told
that
they
are
to
be
presumed...
this
is
to
be
presumed...
were
not
given
any
ifs,
ands,
or
buts
about
it;
all
they
were
told
is
that
it
was
rebuttable,
but
they
were
not
told
at
all
what
quantum
of
evidence
was
required
to
rebut
this
charge.
now,
the
state
claims
that
the
charge's
language
on
rebuttability
distinguishes
the
case
from
sandstrom;
that
that,
first
of
all,
ignores
the
fact
that
sandstrom
held
that
a
rebuttable
presumption
which
the
jury
is
required
to
use
is
unconstitutional
unless
the
nature
of
the
rebuttability
is
explained
so
that
a
reasonable
juror
could
not
believe
that
considerably
more
than
some
evidence
was
required
to
rebut
it.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
in
that
case,
i
would
say
that
there
is
a
sandstrom
violation.
however,
i
would
indicate--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--i
would--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--well,
justice
white,
i--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--my
view
is
that
it
would
violate
sandstrom.
however,
relief
should
not
be
granted
because
under
our
view
of
the
plurality
opinion
in
connecticut
v.
johnson,
where
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
by
the
defendant
or
by
anybody
else
that
would
go
against
the
presumption,
then
i
would
view
this
as
a
situation
in
which
that
would
be
a
case
of
harmless
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
because
analytically
i
would
view
it
as
if
there
had
been
a
charge
in
which
someone
was
told
that
any
evidence
is
enough
to
rebut.
and
where
there
is
a
charge
that
any
evidence
is
enough
to
rebut,
and
that's
clearly
stated,
then
the
court
has
held
that
a
different
kind
of
test
would
apply
because
that
is
merely
a
burden
of
production.
it
would
clearly
be
a
burden
of
production.
here,
where
even
though--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--well,
in
some
circumstances,
putting
a
burden
of
production
can
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
well,
if
the
state
had
produced
no
evidence,
then
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
well,
if
they
were
instructed
that
you
must
find
intent,
i
would
believe
that
the
charge
would
be
constitutional,
but
if
there
had
been
no
evidence,
i
still
would
say
that
it
would
be
harmless
error.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
because
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--where
the...
it
is
necessarily
true
with
every
presumption,
but
if
under
the...
i'm
thinking
of
a
different
line
of
cases
where
we
don't
have
the...
where
it's
just
a
burden
of
production,
and
in
that
line
of
cases,
where
sometimes
a
reasonable
person
could
make
the
presumption
as
a
matter
of
logic
and
it
is
merely
either
permissible
or
it
definitely
only
raises
a
burden
of
production
and
there
is
no
question
that
that's
all
that
it
does,
and
that
any
evidence
could
satisfy
it,
the
court
has
looked
to
whether
it
is
reasonable,
either
if
it's
a
statutory
presumption
in
cases
in
general,
or
they
might
look
at
the
particular
case.
that
is
not
the
question
we
have
in
this
case,
but
that's
what
i
have
in
mind
in
answering
your
honor's
questions.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
that
is
the
kind
of
case--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--well,
justice
burger,
it
was...
the
kind
of
case
that
you
were
referring
to
is
the
kind
of
holding
of
this
court
that
i
was
thinking
of
that
is
different
from
a
sandstrom
context
in
which
it
is
slightly
different
from,
i
believe,
the
hypothetical,
because
in
the
hypothetical
justice
white
posed,
at
least
one
of
the
examples
said
that
any
evidence
would
be
enough
to
respond
to
it.
but
i
believe
that
they
are
quite
similar
to
each
other.
the
reason
why
they're
different
from
this
one,
however,
and
different
from
sandstrom,
as
sandstrom
made
clear,
is
because
this
just
said
"may
be
rebutted".
it
is
a
presumption
that
is
to
be
applied
unless
it
is
rebutted.
if
the
jury
had
been
told
that
any
evidence
whatever
will
satisfy
to
rebut
it,
no
matter
what
the
evidence
is,
there
is
no
longer
a
presumption
at
that
time,
then
the
court's
decision
in
sandstrom
indicates
that
that
might
be
viewed
as
the
equivalent
as
merely
shifting
burden
of
production
and
would
present
different...
a
different
line
of
cases
would
then
be
looked
to.
however,
where
it
does
not
indicate
that
any
evidence
could
satisfy
it
and
the
question
is
left
unclear
and
a
reasonable
juror
might
believe
that
considerably
more
than
some
evidence
is
needed
to
satisfy
it,
then
that
is
very
different
from
both
of
your
hypotheticals,
in
my
view,
and
it
is
very
much,
in
fact
virtually
identical
to
the
situation
discussed
in
sandstrom.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
did
not
specifically
say
that,
but--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--it
did
talk
about
a
presumption.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
it
was
rebuttable,
just
like
the
presumption
in
sandstrom
could
have
been
construed
as
being,
and
just
like,
if
your
honor
will
recall,
the
hankerson
case
where
the
jury
was
told
with
respect
to
self-defense
that
the
defendant
had
to...
that
presumption
would
apply
unless
the
defendant
satisfied
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
self-defense.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
if
that
had
occurred,
there
would
be
several
distinctions
from
this
case.
first
of
all,
they
would
have
been
told
you
may
infer.
here,
they
were
told
this
is
to
be
presumed.
moreover,
in
that
case,
they
would
have
been
told
specifically
that
the...
reminded
about
the
prosecution's
burden
of
proof
on
intent.
here,
in
stark
contrast,
on
the
one
charge
that
came
anywhere
near
close
to
talking
about
intent,
the
jury
was
instructed
with
respect
to
accident
that
they
shall
not
find
anybody
not
guilty
when
he
claims
accident
unless
it
satisfactorily
appears
that
there
was
no
accident.
and
maybe
in
your
hypothetical,
there
might
be
a
different
outcome.
that
is
the
kind
of
distinction
that
the
eleventh--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--that
is
certainly
not.
and
my
point
is
that
the
eleventh
circuit
judges
have
faced
other
situations
with
other
language,
with
other
things
that
are
more
like
this
hypothetical,
and
they
have
come
out
the
other
way.
judge
tjoflat
who
wrote
this
opinion
has
concurred
in
opinions
recently
denying
relief
in
sandstrom
cases.
i
mentioned
that
judge
hill
in
the
corn
case
was
able
to
make
distinctions
that
were
pointed
out
earlier
by
justice
stevens.
and
these
distinctions
are
very
important
in
determining
what
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
concluded.
and
the
eleventh
circuit
is
not
going
off
on
some
wild
expedition
to
rule
in
favor
of
all
sandstrom
claims.
however,
when
they
are
presented
with
a
case
such
as
this
one,
which
is
virtually
identical
to
the
problem
posed
in
sandstrom,
they
have
chosen
to
grant
relief.
the
other
language
in
this
charge
which
has
been
pointed
to
did
not
eliminate
this
problem.
the
charge
on
criminal
intent
not
being
presumed,
at
best,
was
a
conflict
with
the
charge
on
intent
shall
be
presumed.
if
it
meant
the
same
intent,
first
they're
told
in
one
sentence,
intent
shall
be
presumed;
then
they're
told
it
shall
not
be
presumed.
if
it
was
the
same
thing,
we
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
which
of
those
two
conflicting
charges
they
had
followed,
and
under
stromberg
v.
california,
as
well
as
sandstrom,
we
would
have
to
hold
the
charge
unconstitutional.
but,
in
fact,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
carefully
pointed
out,
they
could
have
made
them
consistent
because
what
makes
intent
criminal
in
a
malice
murder
case
is
that
it
be
without
mitigation,
justification,
or
excuse.
and
they
might
well
have
realized
that
they
could
use
the
mandatory
presumption
in
order
to
find
the
intent
to
kill,
and
then
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
presume
the
absence
of
mitigation,
justification,
or
excuse.
we
have
talked
about
the
fact
that
here
the
charge
said
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
state
and
no
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
anything,
but
that
is
similar
to
the
charge
in
sandstrom;
that
the
state
had
the
burden
of
proof,
and
that
the...
to
prove
that
the
defendant
killed
purposely
or
knowingly.
these
do
not
eliminate
the
danger
that
the
jury
could
use
the
presumption
as
a
means
by
which
the
state
satisfied
the
burden
of
proof
unless
the
defendant
presented
considerably
more
than
some
evidence
in
rebuttal.
finally,
the
state
has
pointed
to
the
charge
the
defendant
need
not
produce
evidence
of
mitigation,
justification,
or
excuse,
but
as
i've
just
pointed
out,
that
refers
to
the
malice
part
of
the
charge
which
has
the
unlawful,
deliberate
intention
to
kill,
without
justification,
mitigation,
or
excuse.
now,
the
defense
in
this
case
was
that
the
defendant
did
not
intend
to
kill.
look
at
the
opening
statement
of
the
defense
counsel;
he
stated
defendant
went
to
that
house
without
any
intention
to
kill
anyone.
throughout
his
cross-examination
of
the
various
state
witnesses,
his
whole
purpose
was
to
show
a
lack
of
intent.
he
never
tried
to
show
something
like
self-defense.
he
did
not
claim
that
there
was
a
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation
or
anything
else.
his
defense
was
defendant
did
not
have
the
intent
to
kill.
as
i've
mentioned,
this
accident
charge
actually
increased
the
danger
that
the
jury
would
effectively
place
on
the
defendant
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
intent,
because
the
jury
as
repeatedly
told...
and
as
justice
stevens,
i
believe,
noted...
during
their
deliberations
were
again
told
that
a
person
shall
not
be
found
guilty
of
a
crime
committed
by
misfortune
or
accident
where
it
satisfactorily
appears
there
was
no
criminal
scheme
or
undertaking
or
intention
or
criminal
negligence.
under
this
instruction,
the
only
way
to
find
someone
not
guilty
where
the
defendant
contends
that
there
was
an
accident,
is
if
it
satisfactorily
appears
that
that
there
was
no
intention.
a
reasonable
juror
could
easily
construe
this
as
effectively
putting
on
the
defendant
the
burden
of
persuasion,
of
disproving
intention,
because
who
else
but
the
defendant
would
want
to
make
it
satisfactorily
appear
that
there
was
no
intention?
only
the
defendant
would
want
to
make
that
satisfactorily
appear.
and
the
language
"appear
that
there
be
no
intention.
"
seems
to
require
an
affirmative
finding
of
no
intention,
not
that
the
prosecutor
failed
to
prove
intention
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
thus,
i
would
submit
that
when
the
charge
as
a
whole
is
considered,
the
danger
does
remain
that
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
construed
the
presumption
here
as
requiring
rebuttal
by
considerably
more
than
some
evidence.
and,
therefore,
under
sandstrom
this
charge
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
i
believe
that
at
least
one
of
the
asterisks
deals
with
the
charge
on
the
kidnapping
claim,
and
so
that
is
the
asterisk
on
page
38a.
the
charge...
the
asterisks
on
37a,
i
believe,
refer...
have
no
bearing
on
this
point,
but
i'm
not
certain
of
what
they
include,
although
i
have
notes
here
that
would
indicate
that.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
i
believe
it
was
certainly
no
more
than
a
half
hour
and
probably
was
less
than
that.
and
what
we
do
know
is
that
the
one
thing
the
jury
had
very
well
impressed
on
them
when
they
came
back
was
this
accident
charge,
because
that
they
heard
three
times
and
they
heard
it
the
third
time
when
they
came
back
to
ask
for
a
definition
of
accidental
to
be
given
again,
as
well
as
the
charge
on
malice.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
that
one
in
particular
reemphasized
the
danger
of
a
misconstruction
of
who
really
had
the
burden
of
satisfying
the
jury
with
respect
to
the
element
of
intent.
now,
turning
then
to
whether
this
was
a
harmless
error,
unless
there
are
more
questions
about--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--this
was
a
revolver
and
it
was
one
where
testimony
was
that
the
defendant
had
it
cocked
before
he
got
to
the
door.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
no.
he
intended
to...
he
testified
that
his
normal
habit
was,
for
whatever
reason,
to
cock
guns.
the
other...
well,
the
fact
is
that
he
did
cock
it
and
did
not
fire
it
on
two
subsequent
occasions,
which
i
think
demonstrates
my
point,
as
strange
as
it
may
seem.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
he
did
threaten...
he
threatened
two
people,
but
the
fact
is
they
did
not
give
him
what
he
wanted,
and
he
did
not
fire
that
gun,
even
though
the
gun
was
cocked.
and
so
the
mere
facts
in
his
case,
the
jury
could
have
had
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
he
intended
to
fire
it,
because
he
demonstrated
by
actions
throughout
the
day
when
he
had
this
gun
cocked--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--i
would
account
for
it
by
the
fact
that
he
was
startled
by
the
first
shot.
he
himself
wasn't
even
certain
what
had
happened
with
that
first
shot
or
who
had
fired
it
even.
and
the
second
shot--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--it
doesn't
indicate
he
was
totally
unfamiliar
with
it,
but
he
was
not
as
familiar
as
he
might
have
been.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
on
that
day,
i
said,
your
honor,
not
habitually.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
no.
i
may
have
misconstrued
what
i
intended
to
indicate
by
that,
but
what
i
indicated
was
that
on
that
day
that
people
testified
and
he
testified
that
he
cocked
the
gun.
but
regardless
of
his
experience,
the
fact
is
that
if
he
really
were
an
experienced
shooter,
why
would
his
second
shot
go
in
a
totally
different
direction
and
come
nowhere
near
close
to
hitting
anybody?
now,
there
was
a
lot
of
misstatement
before
of
what
happened
with
the
second
shot.
but
the
testimony
not
of
the
very
confused
wife
of
the
victim,
who
testified
incorrectly
that
the
second
shot
went
into
a
wall
rather
than
in
the
ceiling,
said
it
went
past
her
into
the
wall,
but
the
actual
evidence
of
the
state's
expert
witness
on
the
subject
was
that
this
was
immediately
inside
the
house.
i
mean,
one
looks
at
the
photographs
that
are
in
evidence,
one
will
see
that
the
first
shot
went
through
the
screen
door
at
this
kind
of
angle,
at
the
left
angle,
through
the
inner
wooden
door
in
a
place
that
no
one
could
see
through,
and
then
it
hit
mr.
collie.
the
second
shot
went
through
the
screen
door
and
then
entered
the
glass
pane
of
the
wooden
door
on
the
way,
right
up
into
the
ceiling.
that
shot
didn't
come
close
to
hitting
anybody,
and
when
that
shot
was
fired,
what
did
mr.
franklin
do?
if
he
had
intended
to
shoot
somebody
with
that
shot
and
thought
he
had
hit
somebody,
he
would
have
then
gone
in
the
house,
something
like
that.
what
he
did
was
to
run
away
from
the
house.
he
ran
off
of
the
porch
into
the
yard.
and
ms.
heitmuller
testified
to
that,
and
she
testified
that
her
impression
at
the
time
was
that
that
second
shot
had
come
from
inside
the
house.
they
were
both
very
confused
about
what
even...
who
had
even
fired
that
second
shot
which
did
not
come
close
to
hitting
anybody.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
he
did
shoot
the
man
through
the
heart.
and
i
am
not
contending,
justice
marshall,
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--your
honor,
that...
i
didn't
say
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
guns.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
from
the
facts
in
this
case--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--your
honor,
to
answer
the
question
directly,
he
testified
that
the
purpose
of
cocking
it
was
to
frighten
people,
and
in
any
event--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--i...
in
the
dark
they
cannot.
in
fact,
the
people
inside
the
house
could
not
see
him,
and
he
could
not
see
them,
except
when
mr.
collie
opened
the
door
which
was
at
nine
in
the
morning,
so
it
was
not
dark.
but
the
main
point
i
would
like
to
make
is,
i
am
not
contending,
and
this
case,
we
submit,
does
not
decide...
the
decision
is
not
as
was
suggested
before,
whether
i
can
persuade
the
court
that
the
court
should
find
reasonable
doubt
in
this
case.
the
question
that
we
submit
the
legal
standard
is,
even
if
one
uses
the
dissents
test
in
connecticut
v.
johnson,
is
whether,
had
the
jury
been
properly
charged,
whether
the
evidence
is
so
necessarily
dispositive
of
the
issue
of
intent
that
no
reasonable
juror
could
have
had
a
reasonable
doubt,
had
they
been
properly
charged.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
facts
here,
that
it
is
not
up
to
this
court
to
make
its
decision
as
a
jury
whether...
how
they
would...
having
not
seen
the
defendant's
demeanor--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--i
recognize
the
difference,
but
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--yes.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
the
actual
statement
of
the
defendant
was,
"the
gun
went
off.
"
"i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
anybody.
"
and
that
was
his
statement.
what
i
believe
was
quoted
before
was
the
statement
of
his
counsel.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
well,
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--no.
first
of
all,
it
shows
that
he
isn't
the
most
careful
person
because
he
wasn't
in
for
life.
he
did
not
have
any
life
sentence
of
any
kind.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
i
know
he
said
it,
because
he
did
not
want
to
be
in
jail.
but
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
having
an
intent
to
kill,
because
the
only
way
he
could
have
had
something
to
lose
if
he
really
were
in
for
life
is
if
he
committed
a
capital
murder
with
intent
to
kill.
and
then
he
would
have
something
to
lose.
he
would
have
a
death
sentence.
but
if
he
was
really
in
for
life
and
was
not
intending
to
kill,
and
was
merely
intending
to
escape,
you
don't
get
the
death
sentence
for
escaping.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
i
recognize
that
one
must
take
into
account
his
state
of
mind.
but
one
must
also
take
into
account
the
fact
that
he
was
described
by
virtually
every
witness
in
this
case
as
being
extremely
nervous.
the
deponent...
several
of
them
said
they
had
never
seen
anyone
in
their
life
that
nervous.
and
the
person
who
he
ran
up
to,
mr.
dempsey,
said
that
he
was
nervous
and
frightened.
the
woman,
the
neighbor
of
the
victim,
who
certainly
had
no
reason
to
be
friendly
to
mr.
franklin
in
his
testimony...
in
her
testimony...
testified
that
mr.
franklin,
after
the
shooting,
was
like
he
was
in
shock,
like
he
didn't
know
what
had
happened.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
my
contention
is
that
a
jury
could
have,
if
properly
charged,
could
have
had
a
reasonable
double
about
whether
the
nervousness
caused
this
cocked
gun
to
go
off,
because
that
gun,
it
was
testified
by
the
state's
ballistic
expert,
could
go
off
with
only
three
pounds
of
pressure
applied
to
it.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
the
second
shot,
i
believe,
was
an
nervous
reaction
to
the
first
one,
which
he
had
never
intended
to
fire,
and
went
off...
if
he
had
intended
to
shoot
someone,
your
honor,
he
would
not
have
shot
it
right
up
into
the
ceiling
near
no
one.
that
would
not
be...
and
he
would
then
not
have
run
away
from
the
house
upon
shooting
that
shot.
that
is
not
what
he
would
have
done.
but
i
must
emphasize
that
while
this
sounds
like
a
closing
argument
to
the
jury,
the
point
is
that
what
should
have
happened
is
that
the
defense
counsel
who
did
make
the
closing
argument
to
the
jury
should
have
made
it
to
a
jury
who
had
been
properly
instructed
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
intent,
because
this
is
not
like
a
case
that
was
described
in
connecticut
v.
johnson's
dissent,
of
people
being
shot
50
times
in
the
chest,
or
being
stabbed
42
times,
and
throwing
somebody
off
of
a
bridge.
this
was
a
very
different
event.
and
under
these
circumstances,
whether
or
not
i
persuade
you
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
by
a
preponderance
or
anything
else,
the
point
is
maybe
i
haven't
persuaded
you
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
but
that's
the
very
problem;
not
because
i'm
not
a
good
advocate,
but
the
problem
is
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
that
the
jury
may
actually
have
applied
in
this
case
would
have
required
the
defense
counsel,
or
could
have
required
the
defense
counsel
to
demonstrate
the
absence
of
intent
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
that
this
charge
is
unconstitutional.
now,
it
is
possible
that
in
a
retrial,
if
the
jury
is
properly
charged
or
the
issue
of
intent,
maybe
he
will
be
found
guilty
again.
but
that's
the
right
this
defendant
has.
he
has
the
right,
under
the
united
states
constitution,
to
be...
if
he
is
found
guilty
of
malice
murder,
he
has
the
right
to
have
had
that
trial
done
in
conformance
with
due
process,
with
a
properly
charged
jury.
and
that
is
why
we
believe
that
even
under
the
dissents
test
in
connecticut
v.
johnson,
that
this
was
not
a
harmless
error.
now,
we
do
believe
that
the
plurality
test
in
connecticut
v.
johnson
does
have
application
here,
and
should
be
applied
here
because
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
did
not
have
any
evidence
on
his
side
and
didn't
have
the
matter
in
issue.
and
therefore,
to
rule
in...
using
the
dissent
test
in
this
case,
would
be
to
have
this
court
substitute
itself
for
the
jury.
and
that's
what
we
would
urge
that
it
not
be
done,
but
again,
even
under
that
test,
we
submit
that
that's
standard
could
not
be
met
because
a
reasonable
juror,
properly
instructed,
might
have
found
a
reasonable
doubt.
thank
you
very
much.
