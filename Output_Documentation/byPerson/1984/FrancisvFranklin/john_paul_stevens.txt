justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
a
question
about...
maybe
it's
a
question
of
georgia
law
bock,
because
each
case
has
somewhat
different
facts.
and
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
shot
the
man
through
the
door,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
when
the
door
slammed,
then
the
gun
went
off.
as
a
matter
of
georgia
law,
what
intent
had
to
be
proved
in
order
to
establish
the
conviction.
do
you
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
intended
to
kill
the
victim,
or
merely
intended
to
pull
the
trigger?
justice
stevens
i
still
don't
know
the
answer
to
my
question.
do
they...
is
it
your
understanding
that
as
a
matter
of
georgia
law,
the
intent
that
the
defendant
must
have
is
merely
to
pull
the
trigger,
or
to
kill
the
victim?
justice
stevens
does
that
mean
he
had
to
intend
to
kill
the
victim?
justice
stevens
so
that...
and
you
think
it's
frivolous
to
suggest
that
there
was
any
possible
state
of
facts
whereby
he
didn't
really
intend
to
kill
the
victim?
justice
stevens
of
course,
the
second
shot
went
through
the
roof,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
but,
just
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
you
agree
that
the
intent
was
intent
to
kill?
justice
stevens
may
i
go
back
for
a
moment
to
your
argument
based
on
the
corn
case
and
the
31
other
cases?
i
looked
at
the
opinion
on
the
petition
for
rehearing,
and
they
distinguish...
or
one
of
the
opinions...
distinguish
corn
on
the
grounds
that
those
instructions
said
that
the
presumption
they
are
talking
about
did
not
arise
unless
they
had
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
was
the
intentional
slayer.
there's
no
comparable
instruction
in
this
case,
is
there?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
does
that
go
to
the
point
that
presumption
doesn't
arise
until
after
malice
or
intentional
killing,
which
they
said
in
the
corn
case?
justice
stevens
well,
i
don't
know
about
that
case.
i'm
just
trying
to
explore
your
argument.
in
corn,
the
instruction
was
quite
different;
you
would
agree
with
that?
justice
stevens
may
i
return,
before
you
go
to
on,
to
the
statements
you
made
at
the
beginning,
that
the
sandstrom
type
instruction
was
commonplace
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
what
was
the
date
of
the
trial?
was
it
in
january
of
'79?
justice
stevens
i
knew
he
was
indicted,
but
i
didn't--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
on
the
harmless
error
inquire?
do
you
think
that
we
should
decide
whether
we
think
the
defense
was
frivolous,
or
whether
we
think
the
jury
must
have
thought
it
was
frivolous?
justice
stevens
well,
if
we
focus
on
the
jury,
would
you
care
to
comment
on
the
fact
that
the
jury
came
in
at
the
end
and
said
we
want
another
inspection
on
an
accident
and
intent
and
all?
justice
stevens
you
think
they
could
have
asked
for
that
clarification,
even
though
they
thought
the
absence
of
intent
defense
was
really
a
frivolous
defense?
