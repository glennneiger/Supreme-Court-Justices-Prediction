justice
rehnquist
ms.
boleyn,
when
we
talk
about
the
reasonable
juror
test,
do
you
think
of
that
as
yielding
only
one
result
in
a
given
case,
or
do
you
think
it
could
yield
several
different
results?
let
me
explain
a
minute
what
i
mean.
do
you
think
that...
when
you
say
how
would
a
reasonable
juror
have
understood
these
instructions,
do
you
think
that
only
one
answer
is
permissible,
that
a
reasonable
juror
either
would
have
understood
them
as
permissive
or
would
have
understood
them
as
mandatory?
or
do
you
think
an
answer
is
possible,
well,
a
reasonable
juror
might
have
understood
them
as
permissive
or
might
have
understood
them
as
mandatory;
that
either
one
would
be
reasonable?
justice
rehnquist
let
me
pursue
the
question
that
justice
white
asked
you.
you
are
here
representing
the
state
of
georgia.
now,
are
you
satisfied
with
the
state
of
the
law
which
says
that
if
one
out
of
twelve
jurors
could
reasonably
have
read
a
presumption
as
being
mandatory,
although
eleven
reasonably
read
it...
that
that
means
the
instruction
violated--
justice
rehnquist
--so
you
say
the
reasonable
juror
just
gives
you
one
answer.
justice
rehnquist
it
isn't
a
question
of
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
said
this,
but
another
reasonable
juror
could
have
said
that.
justice
rehnquist
--he
was
tried
in
january?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
tabak,
in
the...
i
think
it's
the
second
footnote
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
at
37a
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
footnote
says:
"the
charge
to
the
jury
in
relevant
part
read
as
follows;
the
challenged
intent
instruction
is
italicized.
"
and
then
you
have
roughly
three
pages
of
small
print
as
to
the
charge.
now,
what
do
the
asterisks
represent?
other
parts
of
the
charge
to
the
jury
that
didn't
deal
with
intent?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
idea
how
long
the
jury
charge
took
to
give?
