ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
the
major
points
that
are
the
question
for
the
court's
resolution
in
this
case,
and
i'd
like
to
briefly
outline
those
points
before
going
back
and
addressing
them
in
more
detail
for
the
court's
consideration.
the
state
of
georgia
originally
sought
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case
because
of
our
great
concern
about
the
ramifications
of
the
holding
of
the
eleventh
circuit
in
connection
with
its
finding
about
the
sandstrom
violation
that
it
found
in
this
case
and
the
application
of
the
reasonable
juror
test
in
sandstrom
to
state
court
instructions,
especially
in
the
context
of
a
federal
habeas
corpus
case.
as
we
stated
in
our
brief
to
the
court,
we
contend
that
the
eleventh
circuit
both
misinterpreted
and
misapplied
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
in
sandstrom
v.
montana
and
specifically
unnecessarily
broadened
the
reasonable
juror
test
set
forth
by
the
court
in
that
decision.
we
contend
that
the
charge
considered
as
a
whole
in
this
case
was
permissive
in
nature,
did
not
have
a
mandatory
effect
on
the
jury,
and
did
not
interfere
with
the
fact-finding
ability
of
the
jurors.
the
second
point
that
we
wish
to
discuss
this
morning
is
our
contention
that
the
eleventh
circuit
properly
considered
whether
or
not
harmless
error
rule
would
prohibit
the
granting
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
this
case,
but
then
improperly
decided
that
the
harmless
error
rule
under
the
facts
of
this
case
did
not
prohibit
the
granting
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
it's
our
contention
that
harmless
error
would
have
prohibited
the
granting
of
the
writ,
as
it's
our
contention
that
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
respondent's
guilt
of
murder,
and
that
his
defense
to
the
charges
was,
in
fact,
frivolous
if
the
facts
of
the
case
are
examined.
the
validity
of
the
holding
in
francis
v.
franklin
is
important
to
us
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
at
the
time
that
mr.
franklin
was
tried,
this
charge
that
is
the
subject
of
the
court's
review
today
was
a
standard
charge
utilized
by
many
of
the
state
courts
in
georgia.
and,
in
effect,
there
are
31
death
penalty
cases
pending
in
the
elevent
circuit
which
potentially
may
be
affected
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
case.
of
course,
the
potential
impact
of
the
harmless
error
rule
is
very
great
in
georgia,
as
if
all
of
these
31
cases,
for
example,
did
have
a
charge
found
to
be
violative
of
sandstrom,
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule
might
prevent
needless
retrial
in
cases
where
the
doubt...
there
is
no
doubt,
excuse
me,
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
respondent.
the
procedural
history
in
this
case,
we
contend,
is
very
important
for
the
court's
consideration
of
these
issues.
first
of
all,
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
the
respondent's
direct
appeal
to
that
court,
found
that
under
the
principles
of
sandstrom,
the
effect
of
the
instruction
was
to
merely
create
a
permissive
instruction,
and
that
it
was
not
unconstitutionally
burden
shifting.
next,
of
course,
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
court,
the
district
court
found
that
under
the
principles
of
sandstrom,
the
charge
in
this
case
was
distinguishable
from
that
found
to
be
unconstitutional
in
sandstrom,
because
there
was
additional
language
considering
the
court's
charge
as
whole
which
indicated
that
the
charge
was,
in
effect,
permissive.
the
eleventh
circuit
then
considered
the
case
on
appeal
and
determined
that
the
effect
of
the
contested
portion
of
the
charge
was
mandatory;
therefore,
the
charge
was
unconstitutional;
therefore,
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
should
be
granted.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
after
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
in
the
franklin
case,
the
court
had
the
occasion
on
several
other
times
to
consider
a
similar
charge,
sometimes
finding
that
the
similar
charge
violated
the
constitution
and
sometimes
finding
that
it
didn't.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
corn
case,
for
example,
there
were
very
similar
instructions,
and
the
panel
considering
that
case
found
that
there
was
no
mandatory
presumption
created
by--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--it
was
after
it
was
the
eleventh
circuit,
your
honor.
it
was
an
eleventh
circuit
case.
essentially,
our
position
is
that
we
urge
a
return
to
the
principles
of
cupp
v.
naughton
in
determining
when
the
reasonable
juror
test
requires
reversal.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
what
the
courts
have
held,
the
eleventh
circuit
held
in
the
holloway
case
that
there
are
three
essential
elements
to
murder
in
georgia.
and,
of
course,
they
relied
on
georgia
case
law
in
making
that
determination.
and
the
first
is
that
it's
an
unlawful
act.
and
then
the
second
is
malice.
and
the
court
held
that
criminal
intent,
specific
criminal
intent,
is
a
sub-category
of
malice,
and
that
one
would
have
to
have
the
intent
to
do
the
act
which
resulted
in
the
killing,
and
it
would
here
to
be
done
with
malicious
intent.
that's
essentially
what
georgia
law
would
require.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no.
we
would
have
to
have
malicious
intent,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
that
would
be
one
of
the
essential
elements,
yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
basically
because
it
seems
like
that
present
counsel
is
now
saying
that
the
gun
could
have
accidentally
discharged
as
a
result
of
the
slamming
of
the
door.
but
if
one
looks
at
the
facts
of
the
case,
what
it
shows
is
that
the
respondent
actually
never
denied
that
he
fired
the
gun.
in
fact,
when
he's
talked
about
the
second
shot
that
was
also
fired
through
the
door,
he
said,
"i
guess
i
cocked
the
hammer
again.
"
this
was
what
was
included
in
his
statement.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
it
did,
your
honor,
but
mrs.
collie,
the
victim's
wife,
said
that
when
she
came
from
her
bedroom,
where
she
had
been
at
the
time
that
her
husband
was
killed,
back
into
the
living
room,
that
that's
when
he
fired
the
second
shot.
and
it
was
her
opinion
that
he
saw
her
shadow
coming
from
the
bedroom
into
the
hall
and
the
second
shot
was
intended
for
her.
in
fact,
she
said
that
on
several
occasions,
that
she
thought
what
happened
is,
he
shot
through
the
door
intending
to
kill
her
also,
but
that
shot
simply
went
awry.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
whether
or
not
the
shot
actually
killed
anyone
would
not
be...
of
course,
the
homicide
would
be
necessary
for
it
to
be
murder,
of
course.
but
the
respondent's
counsel
has
made
a
great
to-do
over
the
fact
that
nobody
else
was
harmed.
of
course,
he
tried
to
harm
them
and,
in
effect,
after
he
had
killed
the
victim,
he
went
up
and
put
the
gun
to
the
temple
of
the
victim's
wife
and
cocked
the
hammer
and
said,
"give
me
the
car
keys
row.
"
so
he
did
take
quite
a
lot
of
threatening
gestures.
he
chased
the
victim's
daughter
throughout
the
house.
she
had
to
escape
by
running
into
the
nearby
woods.
so
there's
more
than
just
the
fact
that
the
two
shots
were
fired
at
the
victim
himself.
it
indicates
the
type
of
intent
that
he
had.
of
course,
first
of
all,
he
starts
out
by
saying
at
the
time
he
originally
escapes
from
the
custody
of
cobb
county
authorities
that
he
has
nothing
to
lose.
the
deputies
say,
"well,
you
know
what
you're
doing?
"
he
says,
"i'm
in
for
life;
i
don't
have
anything
to
lose.
"
in
fact,
he
tells
the
victim's
wife
when
he
holds
the
gun
to
her
head,
"i
might
as
well
kill
you.
"
so
there's
a
great
many
actions
and
interactions
in
the
facts
that
indicate
his
intent,
other
than
just
the
fact
that
he
fired
the
gun,
the
revolver,
through
the
door
twice
in
the
direction
of
the
victim.
another
part
of
the
facts
that
might
should
be
highlighted
for
the
court's
review
is
that
ms.
heitmuller,
who
was
the
dental
hygienist
that
he
kidnapped,
said
that
he
held
the
gun
up
and
positioned
it
in
front
of
the
screen
door,
demanding
the
car
keys
from
the
victim,
and
then
he
demanded
the
keys
once
again,
the
door
was
slammed,
he
pulled
the
trigger,
the
shot
went
through
the
door,
she
heard
the
glass
shatter
and
she
heard
a
moan.
at
this
time,
the
defendant-respondent
still
had
hold
of
her
arm.
at
the
time
that
he
fired
the
second
shot,
he
backed
up
from
the
screen
door
which
covered
the
wooden
door
that
mr.
collie
had
slammed,
fired
the
second
shot,
and
then
he
released
her
arm
and
she
was
able
to
flee.
so
she
was
actually
there
when
the
two
shots
were
fired,
and
he
fired
beth
of
them
through
the
door
with
some
short
interval
being
between
the
first
and
second
shots.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
only
one
hit
home.
the
first
one
pierced
both
the
screen
door,
the
wooden
door,
the
glass,
and
the
curtain
covering
the
glass,
and
then
went
into
the
victim's
lung
and
his
heart.
and
that
was
the
fatal
bullet.
the
second
shot
did
land
in
the
ceiling
of
the
hall
or
the
living
room
or
the
foyer,
if
you
will,
of
the
home
of
the
victim.
we
urge
a
return
to
the
principles
of
cupp
v.
naughton
in
this
case,
in
that
the
federal
habeas
corpus
courts
should
not
be
allowed,
with
intent,
to
merely
search
through
instructions
and
look
for
allegedly
erroneous
language.
but
essentially
what
they
must
do
is
consider
the
charge
as
a
whole
in
determining
the
effect
that
any
presumption
might
have,
instead
of
focusing
on
specific
phraseology
and
determining
that
these
magic
words,
if
you
will,
require
that
habeas
corpus
relief
should
be
granted.
if
the
charge
in
this
case
is
viewed
as
a
whole,
the
charge
itself
is
replete
with
permissive
inferences
and
with
cautions
to
the
jury
about
their
duties
and
their
fact-finding
abilities.
of
course,
there's
the
basic
constitutional
framework
present
in
the
instructions
in
this
case
because,
we
have,
of
course,
repeated
instructions
on
the
presumption
of
innocence,
on
reasonable
doubt,
and
on
the
burden
upon
the
state
to
prove
each
and
every
essential
element
of
the
crime.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
if
you--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--no,
your
honor.
we
don't
object
to
the
test.
we're
not
trying
to
overrule
the
reasonable
juror
test
of
sardstrom.
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
say
that
what's
happening
is
that
the
federal
habeas
corpus
courts
aren't
applying
the
reasonable
juror
test
because,
in
effect,
it's
lost
its
reasonableness.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think
their
analyzation
of
the
test
was
wrong,
your
honor,
because
what
they
started
out
with
was
an
assumption
that
that
language
was
mandatory,
and
therefore
a
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
should
be
granted.
they
made
too
quick
an
assumption
as
to
the
effect
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
think
the
charge
had.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes;
correct.
essentially
what
they
did
is,
they
said
it
had
the
magic
words,
a
person
is
presumed...
therefore,
it
has
to
be
mandatory;
therefore,
it's
unconstitutional;
therefore,
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
should
be
granted.
and
what
they
did
was,
they
said
had
the
constitutional
error
been
cured...
and
what
we're
saying
is
they
need
to
consider
the
whole
charge
before
they
determine
whether,
in
effect,
there's
been
unconstitutional
error;
not
deciding
that
there's
constitutional
error
and
then
seeing
if
it's
cured
by
some
other
language
in
the
charge.
our
position
is
that
the
charge
as
a
whole
neutralized
any
potentially
mandatory
effect
that
any
portions
of
the
charge,
considered
by
themselves,
might
have.
as
i've
said,
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
the
charge
is
the
clear
instruction
to
the
jury
that
the
burden
was
not
on
the
defendant
to
prove
anything,
and
that
the
burden
was
on
the
state
to
prove
each
and
every
essential
element
of
the
crime
of
murder.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think
that
in
reviewing
this
case,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
application
of
the
reasonable
juror
test
would
compel
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
mandatory.
i
think
that
when
you
have
conflicting
presumptions,
say,
in
another
case,
the
reviewing
court
might
have
difficulty
in
determining
how
a
reasonable
juror
would
resolve
the
conflicts.
i
don't
think
that
is
present
in
this
case.
so
essentially,
of
course,
it's
still
a
case-by-case
application
of
the
reasonable
juror
standard.
but
i
think
if
it's
not
clear
that
a
reasonable
juror
would
find
it
to
be
permissive,
then,
of
course,
i
suppose
the
court
would
have
to
find
that,
you
know,
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
assume
that
all
the
jurors
did
apply
that
kind
of
an
interpretation.
in
this
particular
case,
we
think
it's
very
clear,
though,
because
essentially
the
major--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--oh,
yes,
your
honor,
i
think--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i
suppose
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court
has
held
that
it's
the
possibility
that
the
presumption
influenced
the
verdict
that
the
court's
examining
when
it
applies
the
reasonable
juror
test.
and,
of
course,
if
the
charge
is
so
permissive
in
nature
that
it
makes
the
possibility
very
slim
that
any
of
the
jurors
acting
in
a
reasonable--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i
guess,
your
honor,
since
you
have
to
have
unanimous
verdict
in
georgia,
of
course,
that
the
possibility
that
one
might
have
interpreted
still
wouldn't
invalidate
it
unconstitutionally,
though:
that
what
you're
doing
is...
of
course,
we
can't
go
back
and
determine
how
many
of
the
jurors
thought...
but
what
you're
doing
is,
under
these
instructions,
eliminating
the
possibility
or
making
it
so
small
that
any
reasonable
juror
would
find
it
to
be
permissive.
so
it's
reducing
that
possibility
that
the
reviewing
court
would
have
to
do.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
it
was.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
happened
is,
then
they
considered
on
virtually
the
same
language
in
the
corn
case
and
three
other
judges
of
the
eleventh
circuit
said
that
it
wasn't
unreasonable.
so
i
guess
in
response
to
that,
we
do
have
inconsistency
in
the
application
of
the
standard
to
similar
language.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not;
because
i
think
that
when
you
start
saying
what
one
particular
juror
would
think,
you're
not
applying
the
reasonable
juror
test
anymore.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
right.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
that's
correct,
because
what
you're
doing,
of
course,
in
federal
habeas
corpus
review,
the
federal
habeas
court
is
looking
for
denial
of
fundamental
fairness,
and
because
of
that,
you're
not
trying
to
determine
what
individual
jurors
might
think,
but
trying
to
place
yourself
in
the
position
of
one
reasonable
juror.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
there's
a
comparable
instruction
in
the
case
on
the
malice
part
of
it,
your
honor.
the
malice
charge
is
excellent
in
this
case
because
it
tells
the
jury
that
malice
is
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
charged,
that
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
disprove
malice,
that
the
burden
is
not
on
the
defendant
to
prove
anything
with
reference
to
the
essential
element
of
the
offense.
and
it
specifically
tells
the
jury
that
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
them
to
prove
excuse,
mitigation,
or
justification.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think
what
they
did
in
corn,
perhaps
i
can
make
myself
clearer
if
i
indicate
to
the
court
what
my
idea
of
what
they
did.
they
properly
utilized
the
reasonable
juror
test.
they
looked
at
all
portions
of
the
charge
before
they
determined
whether
it
was
mandatory,
rather
than
using
this
curative
type
language
that
the
eleventh
circuit
utilized
in
franklin--
in,
i
believe
it's
the
tucker
case
that
was
decided
even
after
corn
after
franklin,
the
exact
same
charge
that
was
in
this
case
was
again
found
to
be
constitutional.
it's
just
not
clear--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes,
it
was.
most
definitely.
here,
of
course,
i
think
we
probably
have
a
stronger
charge
on
malice.
that
was
merely
my
point;
i
think
that
here
the
malice
charge,
we
contend,
was
so
important
because
we
contend
the
real
dispute
was
over
whether
he
maliciously
fired
the
gun
so
as
to
cause
the
death
of
mr.
collie;
that
it
was
the
malice
element
that
would
be
the
major
factor
that
the
jury
would
have
to
determine
in
deciding
whether
he
was
guilty
of
murder
or
nothing,
as
he
plead
accident,
and
also
that
he
did
not
have
the
intention
to
kill
the
victim
when
he
went
to
the
victim's
home.
it's
interesting--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
the
trial
was
in
april
of
'79.
indictment
was
in...
the
offense
was
january
12,
1979,
and
i
believe
he
was
tried
april
23rd,
24th,
and
25th.
and
then,
of
course,
sandstrom--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--he
was
tried
in
april.
indicted
in
january,
tried
in
april.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
in
june
of...
june,
after
the
trial
being
in
april.
and
then
in
october
of
that
year,
the
georgia
supreme
court
adopted
the
test
of
sandstrom
in
its
own
case.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
on
direct
appeal
to
the
georgia
supreme
court.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
he
attacked
both
the
intent
portion
of
the
charge
and
the
malice
portion
of
the
charge,
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
said
that
the
intent
portion
was
permissive
and
the
malice
charge
was
definitional
and
properly
informed
the
jury
of
their
standard
in
citing
skrine,
which
is
the
georgia
supreme
court
version
of
sandstrom,
in
which
it
adopts
sandstrom.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
it
was
presented
in
the
initial
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
by
the
georgia
supreme
court.
i
believe,
as
i've
said
in
this
particular
charge,
the
malice
instruction
was
very
significant
and,
of
course,
the
challenged
instruction
itself
was
distinguishable
from
that
reviewed
by
the
court
in
sandstrom,
in
that
the
jury
was
specifically
told
as
soon
as
the
presumption
was
given,
that
the
presumption
was
rebuttable
and
that
a
person
will
not
be
presumed
to
act
with
criminal
intention.
the
jurors
were
told
that
they
should
say,
after
consideration
of
all
the
facts
and
circumstances,
whether
reasonable
doubt
existed
and
that
they
should
be
concerned
that
the
verdict...
and
i
believe
the
words
the
judge
used,
"speaks
the
truth
of
the
case
on
the
facts
as
you
find
them.
"
he
told
the
jurors
that
malice
must
exist
before
the
alleged
homicide
could
be
murder,
and
he
told
the
jurors
that
the
defendant
contended,
by
his
not
guilty
plea,
that
the
material
elements
of
the
offense
had
not
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
that
the
homicide
was
an
accident.
apparently,
what
the
eleventh
circuit
seems
to
be
doing
in
its
decision
in
franklin
is
compelling,
through
its
habeas
corpus
powers,
specific
language
in
trial
courts'
instructions
to
the
jury
on
intent,
as
it
did
with
the
case
law
to
its
federal
trial
courts
in
its
supervisory
capacity.
essentially,
our
contention
is
that
the
federal
habeas
corpus
courts
are
trying
to
oversimplify
the
reasonable
juror
test.
they
want
to
look
for
magic
words
and
say
that
this
compels
the
conclusion
that
it's
a
mandatory
instruction
and
that
habeas
corpus
relief
should
be
granted.
and
our
basic
contention
is
that
before
the
conclusion
is
made
as
to
the
effect
of
the
charge,
and
whether
it's
permissive,
mandatory,
or
burden
shifting,
that
the
trial
court's
charge
as
a
whole
must
be
reviewed,
as
well
as
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
including
the
offense
that
he's
charged
with,
as
essential
elements,
the
defenses
that
the
respondent
brings
up
and
the
strength
of
the
evidence.
of
course,
we
contend
that
if
the
reasonable
juror
test
was
properly
applied
in
this
case,
that
no
habeas
corpus
relief
would
have
been
granted
by
the
court.
the
remainder
of
the
trial
court's
instructions
neutralized
any
potentially
mandatory
interpretation
that
a
reasonable
juror
could
make
of
these
constructions.
if
there
are
not
further
questions
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
sandstrom
violation
as
an
initial
matter,
i'll
move
to
my
discussion
of
the
harmless
error
rule
in
connection
with
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
harmless
error
rule,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
there
was
no
procedural
bar
to
this
court
considering
the
harmless
error
question,
because
it
was
considered
by
the
eleventh
circuit
below.
it
said
that
chapman
v.
california
harmless
error
test
was
applicable
in
sandstrom
violations,
but
then
of
course
our
disagreement
is
with
their
finding
that
under
the
chapman
test,
it
was
not
harmless
error
in
this
particular
case.
of
course,
as
i've
already
said,
we
contend
that
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
respondent's
intent
to
murder
and
his
malice
and
all
of
the
other
essential
elements
of
the
offense,
and
that
there
was
simply
no
question
but
that
he
shot
and
killed
mr.
collie
with
malice.
his
defense
to
this
crime
was,
in
effect,
frivolous.
what
his
statement
said
after
it
was
admitted
at
trial
was
that
the
gun
went
off
when
the
door
slammed.
that's
the
phrase
that
he
used.
and
then
mysteriously,
for
some
unknown
reason,
and
unexplained
in
his
confession,
the
gun
simply
went
off
again,
and
as
i
said,
he
said
it
must...
"i
must
have
cocked
the
gun
again
for
some
other
reason.
"
his
defense
to
the
crime
was
just
frivolous
in
the
sense
that
the
defense
attorney
tried
to
say
that
he
was
excited
because
he
had
escaped.
he
was
fearful,
and
that
when
the
door
slammed,
it
somehow
scared
him
into
pulling
the
trigger.
of
course,
that
doesn't
explain,
we
submit,
why
he
eventually
fired
the
second
shot
that
was
right
over
the
defendant's
wife's
head
and
in
her
general
direction,
and
it
doesn't
explain
why
he
opened
the
door
of
mr.
collie's
home,
stepped
over
the
fallen
body
of
mr.
collie,
rifled
through
his
pockets
looking
for
the
victim's
car
keys,
and
when
there
were
no
car
keys
in
mr.
collie's
pockets,
he
proceeds
to
chase
his
wife
and
daughter
throughout
the
house,
threatening
them
with
bodily
harm
and
placing
the
gun
to
the
temple
of
mrs.
collie's
head.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think
that
i
would
advocate
a
reasonable
juror
test
and
the
harmless
error
situation
as
well.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
they
didn't
ask
for
a
reinstruction
on
the
challenged
presumption.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
they
asked
for
a
reinstruction
on
malice
and
accident.
and
i
think
basically
it's
our
contention
that
it's
not
unusual
for
jurors
to
ask
for
a
recharge
on
malice,
because
that's
a
word
that
jurors
sometimes
have
trouble
with,
the
legal
definition
of
malice.
and
as
for
the
accident
charge,
we
think
it's
at
least
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
jurors
were
trying
to
determine
what
legal
accident
is,
versus
the
common
ordinary
meaning
of
that
term,
if
there
was
such
a
distinction,
and
because
it
was
simply
redefinitions
that
the
jurors
were
asking
for,
it's
not
a
case
such
as
bollenbach
in
where--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i
think
the
fact
that
they
asked
for
reclarification
doesn't
indicate
that
they
were
confused
by
the
current
instructions.
in
the
opening
statement
that
defense
counsel
made
on
the
petitioner's
behalf,
he
stated
that
his
version
of
the
facts
did
not
differ
significantly
from
the
state's
version,
and
at
the
time
of
his
closing
argument,
defense
counsel
said
raymond
franklin
did
fire
the
shot
that
killed
claude
collie,
but
he
didn't
kill
any
other
people.
he
did
take
carol
heitmuller
from
the
dentist's
office.
so
he,
in
fact,
admitted
that
his
client
had
fired
the
gun.
he
said
the
door
slammed
in
his
face
and
"bang",
the
gun
went
off.
he
simply
tried
to
reiterate
to
the
jury
that
the
respondent
was
scared,
excited,
didn't
hurt
anyone
else,
and
perhaps
was
suffering
from
the
effect
of
the
novocaine
in
his
body.
assuming,
but
not
conceding,
that
there
has
been
a
sandstrom
violation,
it's
our
position
that
the
harmless
error
rule
should
be
applied
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
due
to
the
overwhelming
nature
of
the
evidence
against
the
respondent
and
the
frivolous
nature
of
his
defense.
the
relief
which
we
would
request
from
the
court
is,
as
an
initial
matter,
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
finding
that
there
was
a
sandstrom
violation
in
the
case
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
consideration
of
the
other
issues
because
the
only
issue
that
the
eleventh
circuit
decided
was,
in
fact,
the
sandstrom
violation
issue.
if
this
court
should
determine
that
an
affirmance
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
finding
on
the
sandstrom
violation
is
appropriate,
we
would
then
ask
that
the
court
go
ahead
in
its
authority
and
apply
the
harmless
error
rule
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
therefore
prohibit
the
granting
of
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
under
these
facts.
and
again,
of
course,
a
remand
would
be
necessary
in
either
case
because
of
the
fact
the
other
issues
were
not
decided.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
we
would
just
like
to
reiterate
for
the
court's
consideration
that
in
considering
both
whether
or
not
there
was
an
initial
sandstrom
violation
and
in
considering
the
harmless
error
issue,
that
our
view
of
the
evidence
is
that
it
overwhelmingly
showed
the
respondent's
intent
to
kill
and
that
the
true
argument
of
defense
counsel
in
his
behalf
was
that
he
did
not
intend
to
kill
anybody
when
he
went
to
the
house;
that
the
purpose
in
going
to
the
house
of
mr.
collie
was
because
there
were
three
cars
sitting
in
the
yard,
and
he
thought
he
could
get
a
set
of
car
keys
to
these
cars
at
gunpoint
and
by
cocking
the
gun
and
frightening
these
people.
so
our
view
of
the
evidence
is
that
it
overwhelmingly
establishes
all
of
the
essential
elements
of
murder
in
the
case.
thank
you.
