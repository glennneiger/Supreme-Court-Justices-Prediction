chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
francis
v.
franklin.
ms.
boleyn,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
an
internal,
intra-circuit
conflict?
chief
justice
burger
what
before
or
after
we
divorced
the
east
divison
from
the
west,
the
eleventh--
chief
justice
burger
and,
to
some
extent,
intent
is
mixed
up
with
how
good
a
marksman
the
man
is.
chief
justice
burger
how
many
shots
hit
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
tabak.
chief
justice
burger
is
the
burden
suggested
by
justice
white's
question
any
different
from
the
"burden"
that
this
court
has
placed
on
the
person
found
in
possession
of
recently
stolen
property,
and
from
evidence
that
the
defendant
was
found
in
possession
of
recently
stolen
property,
the
jury
may
infer
that
he
was
the
thief?
chief
justice
burger
does
it
shift
the
burden
any
more
in
the
case
i've
just
cited
than
in
the
one
justice
white
propounded?
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
have
just
told
us
that
he
habitually
cocked
a
gun
when
he
was
carrying
it
around.
chief
justice
burger
oh,
i
thought
you
said
habitually.
chief
justice
burger
how
do
you
compare
that
with
his
statement
that
he
was
in
for
life
before
he
had
made
this
escape?
he
was
in
for
life
and
had
nothing
to
lose.
chief
justice
burger
don't
you
think
there's
a
little
inconsistency
with
your
analysis
and
his
own
statement?
chief
justice
burger
my
question
is
focused
on
your
argument
about
the
state
of
mind.
you
have
made
a
great
deal
about
this
man's
state
of
mind;
that
he
really
didn't
intend
to
hurt
anybody.
but
his
own
statement
indicates
that
he
thought
he
was
in
for
life,
as
his
statement
appears
in
the
record,
and
that
he
thought
he
had
nothing
to
lose.
so
if
you're
emphasizing
his
state
of
mind,
you
must
take
that
into
account.
and
i,
for
one,
must
take
it
into
account.
chief
justice
burger
but
he
wasn't
too
nervous
to
manage
to
cock
the
gun
twice
and
get
two
shots
off,
one
of
which
killed
this
man.
chief
justice
burger
how
about
the
second
shot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
boleyn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
