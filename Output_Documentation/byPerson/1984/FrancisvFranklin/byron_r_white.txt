justice
white
well,
assume
we
look
over
the
entire
set
of
instructions
and
conclude
that
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
believed
that
all
the
prosecution
would
have
to
prove
in
light
of
these
instructions
was
that
he
pulled
the
trigger?
justice
white
now,
do
you
object
to
that
test,
that
we
look
to
see
what
a
reasonable
jury
might
conclude
after
looking
at
all
the
instructions?
justice
white
so
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
right
test
and
you
think
they
just
came
out
wrong.
justice
white
don't
you
think
it
would
be
possible
for
two
jurors
to
have
different
views
of
the
instructions
as
a
whole
and
both
be
very
reasonable?
justice
white
all
right.
so
there
are
two
reasonable
constructions.
now,
let's
assume
that
we
really
could
poll
all
the
jurors
and
there
were
eleven
that
thought
that
the
prosecution
had
to
prove
intent;
you
just
couldn't
presume
it
under
all
the
instructions.
and
there
was
just
one,
a
very
reasonable
juror,
who
thought
that
if
the
prosecution
proved
that
the
defendant
pulled
the
trigger,
that's
all
they
had
to
prove
because
we
have
been
told
that
you
should
infer
intent
unless
the
defendant
disproves
it?
now,
what
if
there's
just
one
out
of
the
twelve?
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
white
in
my
hypothetical
there
are
eleven
reasonable
jurors
who
have
one
view
and
there's
one
reasonable
juror
who
has
another
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
instructions.
and
the
one...
his
understanding
would
violate
sandstrom.
now,
would
you
think
that
one
reasonable
juror
believing
that
is
enough
to
invalidate
the--
justice
white
--well,
three
of...
this
was
unanimous
below,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
so
three
court
of
appeals
judges
are
unreasonable.
justice
white
well,
let's
presume
the
presumption...
everybody
would
agree
that
the
instruction
indicated
a
rebuttable
presumption.
what
if
there
weren't
any
evidence
from
the
defendant
at
all?
justice
white
yes,
but
would
you
say
that
the
instruction
should...
in
order
to
violate
sandstrom,
would
have
to
tell
the
jury
that
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
by
the
defendant,
you
must
find
intent?
justice
white
or,
would
you
say
that
it's
enough
to
violate
sandstrom
to
tell
a
jury
that
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
from
the
defendant,
you
may
infer
intent,
but
you
are
not
required
to?
justice
white
or
do
both
violate
sandstrom?
justice
white
you
don't
think
this
putting
a
burden
of
production
on
the
defendant
is
unconstitutional?
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
jury
is
told
that
you
must
infer
intent
unless
the
defendant
produces
some
evidence?
justice
white
well,
but
the
state
produces
the
evidence
on
which
the
presumption
is
built;
he
pulled
the
trigger.
and
the
state
argues
that
that
is
enough
evidence
to
justify
a
finding
of
intent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
judge
instructs
that
you
may
infer
intent
from
that,
and
unless
the
defendant
comes
forward
with
some
evidence,
you
either
must
or
you
may
find
intent.
justice
white
why
is
that?
justice
white
why
must
the
defendant
come
forward
with
some
evidence?
justice
white
but
this
instruction
didn't
say
that
the
defendant
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
proof,
did
it?
justice
white
it
just
talked
about
a
presumption.
justice
white
and
it
was
rebuttable.
justice
white
well,
the
jury
is
told
that
you
may
infer
or
presume
intent
from
the
pulling
of
the
trigger,
this
is
a
presumption,
but
it's
rebuttable.
and
the
next
sentence
is:
but,
remember,
the
prosecution
has
the
burden
of
proving
every
element
of
the
case,
including
intent.
justice
white
that
isn't
this
case.
