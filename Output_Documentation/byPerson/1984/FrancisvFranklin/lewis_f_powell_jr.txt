justice
jr.
oh,
tried
in
april?
justice
jr.
when
did
we
hand
down
sandstrom?
justice
jr.
yes,
but
when
did
this
defendant
first
raise
the
sandstrom
question?
justice
jr.
initially?
justice
jr.
was
the
sandstrom
charge
presented
to
us
in
either
one
of
the
prior
petition?
justice
jr.
before
you
go
into
that,
counsel,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
defendant
admitted
that
he
fired
the
gun.
i
suppose
in
almost
every
capital
case
one
could
contend
after
he
fired
a
gun
that
he
hadn't
intended
to
do
it
deliberately;
that
it
went
off
accidentally.
but
very
few
guns
go
off
accidentally;
in
particular,
when
you
have
to
cock
them.
was
this
a
revolver?
justice
jr.
what
is
the
purpose
of
that,
unless
he
intended
to
shoot
somebody?
justice
jr.
he
did
threaten
one
of
them,
the
daughter.
justice
jr.
how
would
you
account
for
him
cocking
it
the
second
time?
justice
jr.
do
you
think
he
was
unfamiliar
with
guns?
does
the
record
indicate
that?
