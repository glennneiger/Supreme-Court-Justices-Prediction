justice
stevens
mr.
henry.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
there
was
retained
counsel
in
this
case,
was
there
not?
justice
stevens
and
i
got
the
impression
from
i
think
it
was
the
hammershoy
case
that
perhaps
if
it
had
not
been
retained
counsel
but
he'd
been
indigent,
that
maybe
your
state
courts
would
have
taken
a
different
view
of
the
matter.
is
that
true,
or
do
you
think
the
same
rule
applies
to
both?
justice
stevens
what
is
your
best...
what
would
be
your
best
judgment
under
the
kentucky
practice?
if
this
had
been
an
indigent
appeal
rather
than
retained
counsel,
do
you
think
the
result
would
have
been
the
same?
or
you
just
don't
know?
justice
stevens
public
defender,
yes.
justice
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
from
your
colloquy,
i
gather
this
problem
has
arisen
more
than
once
in
kentucky.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
which
suggests
there
may
be
either
some
clever
lawyers
or
some
incompetent
lawyers
in
kentucky,
and
i
am
wondering
if
the
revision
in
procedures
includes
some
procedure
for
disciplining
counsel
who
are
found
to
have
been
so
incompetent
as
to
be
unable
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
