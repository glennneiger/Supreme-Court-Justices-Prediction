justice
thurgood
marshall
--mr.
radigan?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
at
the
trial
of
the
case
where
you
have
appointed
counsel
and
he
gives
up
in
the
middle
of
the
case
and
goes
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
what
did
the
state
due?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is...
the
lawyer
just
walked
out
of
the
courtroom.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
at
that
stage,
what
should
the
court
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--well,
suppose
the
individual
walks
out
of
the
courtroom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
is
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
court
have
to
enforce
that
right,
or
does
the
bar
association
enforce
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
don't
know
what...
the
court
didn't
know
that
this
lawyer
was
not
going
to
file.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
court
know
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
could
the
court
have
done
to
stop
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
stop
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
court
is
not
responsible
for
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
now
you
are
going
to
make
the
court
do
something
for
what
they
are
not
responsible
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
i
agree
with
you
that
he
could
do
that
and
punish
the
attorney,
i
don't
see
what
he
could
do
about
the
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
the
court
of
appeals
of
appeals
enforce
its
ruling
other
than
to
enforce
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
they
do
other
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
don't...
your
argument
is
that
kentucky
must
adopt
the
good
rules
of
every
other
appellate
court
in
the
country.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
know
what
else
you
are
arguing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
a
court
enforce
this
rule
that
you
must
file
within
ten
days
other
than
to
not
accept
anything
after
ten
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
rule
is
not
being
enforced.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could...
well,
how
can
you
unring
a
bell?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
want
to
make
the
rule
retroactive.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
else
are
you
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
want
the
rule?
if
the
rule
is
made
retroactive,
will
you
be
satisfied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
rule
which
says
you
have
five
days
to
file
that
supplemental.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wasn't
my...
it
wasn't
my
question.
if
we
say
that,
are
you
satisfied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
if
they
say
he
can
file
this
five
day
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
well,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do,
to
say
he
ipsy
dixie
gets
an
appeal?
