justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
the
best
evidence
of
a
view
of
a
kentucky
appellate
court
of
how
the
failure
on
this
appeal
should
be
treated
is
the
decision
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
which
dismissed
this
appeal.
justice
rehnquist
and
which
is
an
intermediate
appellate
court
now.
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
radigan,
supposing
that
mr.
lucey's
counsel's
failure
in
this
case
had
not
been
to
file
a
statement
attached
to
his
brief,
or
whatever
it
is
that
was
found
defective,
but
supposing
instead
that
the
kentucky
statutes
provided
you
are
going
to
challenge
a
criminal
conviction
by
appeal,
you
must
file
a
notice
of
appeal
within
30
days,
and
his
counsel
simply
had
not
done
that,
do
you
say
that
he
is
then
denied
effective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
rehnquist
in
other
words,
a
state
may
not
have
any
system
regulating
the
filing
of
appeals?
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
no,
does
that
mean
you
are
agreeing
with
me
or
you
are
not
agreeing
with
me?
justice
rehnquist
well,
now,
then
your
response
to
my
question
about
a
30
day
time
limit
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
is
that
if
the
attorney
didn't
file
that,
the
client
ipso
facto
has
been
denied
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
so
a
rule
requiring
a
timely
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
in
criminal
cases,
whether
federal
or
state,
is
just
not
worth
the
paper
it
is
written
on.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i
really
want
an
answer
to
my
question.
the
client
tells
the
attorney
to
appeal.
the
state
statute
says
30
days
in
which
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
the
attorney
fails
to
file
the
notice
of
appeal.
that's
automatically
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
appeal,
so
that
in
effect,
no
client
who
wants
to
appeal
is
ever
to
be
barred
by
his
attorney's
failure
to
comply
with
time
limits.
justice
rehnquist
and
so
the
client
gets
an
appeal
at
a
later
date,
notwithstanding
his
attorney's
failure
to
comply
with
the
state
statute.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then--
--so
i
guess...
go
ahead.
go
ahead.
justice
rehnquist
but
in
cronic
we
were
talking
about
performance
at
a
trial--
justice
rehnquist
--which
is
clearly
covered
by
the
sixth
amendment.
now,
you
don't
quarrel
with
mckane
v.
durston,
do
you,
saying
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
an
appeal?
justice
rehnquist
but
you
say
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
an
appeal,
there
is
some
sort
of
due
process
right
to
the
services
of
an
attorney
if
a
state
grants
you
an
appeal.
justice
rehnquist
but
now
both
swenson
and
anders
that
you
have
referred
to
are
cases
that
are
talking
about
indigents,
and
they
are
saying
that
you
can't
treat
them
worse
at
the
appellate
stage
than
you
do
people
who
have
money
to
hire
a
lawyer
or
pay
fee.
but
there's
no
indication
here,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
would
have
treated...
that
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
treated
your
client
this
way
because
he
was
indigent.
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you
read
those
cases
correctly,
though
i
recognize
that
there
may
be
two
respectable
points
of
view
on
it.
when
the
court
says
that
you
can't
treat
an
indigent
worse
than
someone
with
retained
counsel
or
ability
to
pay
the
fees,
they
are
not
saying
there
is
an
absolute
standard
by
which
the
rights
of
people
who
can
pay
is
to
be
governed.
they
are
simply
saying
you
can't
put
additional
hurdles
in
the
way
of
someone
who
is
indigent.
i
don't
think
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
put
any
hurdles
in
the
way
of
your
client
here
because
he
was
indigent.
justice
rehnquist
well,
you--
