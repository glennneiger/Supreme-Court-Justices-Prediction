mr.
william
m.
radigan
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
let
me,
before
i
get
into
a
discussion
of
the
substantive
issues
that
we
have
here
in
the
case,
let
me
take
care
of
a
few
preliminary
matters,
if
i
may.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
regard
to
the
mootness
question
that
you
raised
with
mr.
henry,
the
last
time
i
talked
to
my
client,
which
was
about
ten
days
ago,
he
was
very
much
interested
in
continuing
his
case.
since
1977
he
has
wanted
a
direct
appeal
from
his
conviction
in
the
madison
circuit
court,
and
he
still
wants
that
appeal
because
he
thinks
he
was
unjustly
convicted
there
and
he
does
want
to
clear
his
name.
but
that
was
ten
days
ago
before
i
realized,
from
the
benefit
of
mr.
henry's
letter
to
this
court,
that
his
sentence
has
been
eliminated,
and
he
is
no
longer
under
any
type
of
restrictions
from
his
conviction.
but
i
think
that
this
court
has
to
also
look
and
examine
at
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
case
is
capable
of
repetition.
interestingly
enough,
justice
o'connor,
when
you
mentioned
the
stahl--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--he
has
served
out
his
sentence.
in
kentucky,
he
received
a...
mr.
lucey
received
a
ten
year
sentence.
at
the
time
of
their
admission
to
prison,
they
are
given
a
good
time
credit
of
one
quarter
of
their
sentence,
so
that
reduces
it
to
seven
and
a
half
years.
with
his
credit
for
having
served,
he
has
not
served
that
time
from
1977.
so
this
is...
he
has
served
all
his
time
that
he
could
have,
either
in
prison
or
under
the
supervision
of
any
type
of
parole.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
yes,
your
honor,
it
could
under
kentucky
law.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
it
is
quite
a
burden.
additionally,
if
he
goes
to
trial
under
any
other
felony,
he
would
then
be
subject
to
a
persistent
felony
offender
prosecution
at
the
discretion
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
that's
my
position,
your
honor.
i
definitely
think
that
this
is
an
issue
for
mr.
lucey
that
he
has
interest
in,
and
i
also
think
it
is
capable
of
repetition.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
no,
your
honor,
but
as
far
as--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
justice
o'connor
raised
the
question
of
does
not
the
stahl
decision
in
1981
eliminate
this
problem
totally
for
kentucky,
and
let
me
clarify
that,
if
i
may.
now,
on
november
15
of
this
year
i
have
an
argument
before
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
on
exactly
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court
right
now,
whether
or
not
there
is
effective
assistance
of
counsel
standard
for
counsel
on
appeal.
the
stahl
decision
may
seem
to
have
cured
that
situation
from
its
language,
from
its
apparent
language,
but
the
stahl
decision
was
handed
down
by
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
solely
because
the
supreme...
excuse
me,
the
sixth
circuit
in
an
earlier
case
of
cleaver
v.
bordenkircher
in
1980
directed
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
to
do
the
same
thing
they
did
in
stahl
in
the
cleaver
case.
this
case
has
been...
this
issue,
excuse
me,
has
been
before
the
sixth
circuit
in
cases
arising
out
of
kentucky
to
my
knowledge
on
five
different
occasions
because
i
have
been
involved
in
those
cases,
as
has
my
opponent,
mr.
henry.
we
have
a
situation
where
kentucky...
and
justice
blackmun,
let
me
explain
the
significance
of
england
v.
spalding
because,
interestingly
enough,
under
the
present
procedures
in
kentucky
as
they
are
implemented,
if
the
same
factual
circumstances
in
lucey
occurred
today,
the
case
would
not
be
dismissed,
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
would
issue
what
is
called
a
deficiency
statement,
and
because
it
is
a
nonjurisdictional
matter,
would
give
counsel
a
limited
amount
of
time
to
cure
that
error.
and
that
makes
it
all
the
more
egregious
the
situation
that
mr.
lucey
finds
himself
in
today,
without
ever
having
the
opportunity
to
raise
the
challenges
to
his
conviction,
to
be
able,
in
the
words
of
this
court,
to
have
an
attorney
marshal
arguments
for
him,
to
present
and
organize
law,
and
to
present
the
facts
of
his
conviction
to
an
appellate
court
for
some
sort
of
review.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
no,
no,
and
please
let
me
clarify
this.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
i
am
agreeing
with
you
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
definite
need
in
any
type
of
case,
your
honor,
to
have,
whether
we
are
talking
civil
or
criminal,
whether
we
are
talking
trial
or
appeal,
there
is
a
necessity
and
indeed
an
absolute
necessity
to
have
some
sort
of
rules
of
procedure
for
organizing
and
for
documenting
and
for
proceeding
on
any
type
of
a
case.
and
we
concede
that
fact.
what
we
do
have,
though,
is
a
question
of
when
an
individual
is
essentially
punished
because
of
actions
that
are
not
his
fault
but
the
fault
totally
and
solely
of
his
client...
of
his
attorney.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
no,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
there
because
assuming...
let's
assume
under
your
factual
scenario
that
the
client
has
told
his
attorney
yes,
i
want
to
appeal
my
conviction.
in
kentucky,
in
a
criminal
case,
it
is
ten
days
to
file
that
notice
of
appeal.
under
those
circumstances,
as
this
court
said
in
barnes
v.
jones,
the
decision
to
appeal
is
the
client's
decision.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
i
agree
with
your
conclusion,
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
very
true.
it
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
because
an
attorney
who
has
reasonable
training
and
experience
should
be
able
to
file
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
after
his
client
requests
it
a
notice
of
appeal
within
ten
days,
and
so
under
those
circumstances
and
with
those
assumptions,
that
a
reasonable
attorney
could
do
that,
then
indeed
it
would
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
i
believe
that's
correct.
you
lack--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--i
think,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
kentucky
cases
on
those,
the
hammershoy
case
that
was
mentioned
to
you,
and
the
stahl
case
in
kentucky,
both
of
them
recognized
exactly
the
scenario
you
just
presented,
and
both
of
those
decisions
recognizes
the
fact
that
in
stahl,
because
of
overloaded
public
defender
case,
and
in
hammershoy,
justice
rehnquist,
because
the
attorney
failed
to
file
the
notice
of
appeal
within
ten
days,
that
those
situations
constituted
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
therefore
there
was
a
procedure
to
go
back
and
to
attempt
to
reinstate
essentially
that
appeal
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
now
it
does.
in
1977
and
'78
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
cleaver
v.
commonwealth
had
said
that
when
a
state
appellate
court
dismisses
an
appeal,
that
there
was
no
right
to
go
back
to
the
trial
court
to
have
that
appeal
reinstated
even
on
grounds
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
if
the
courts
in
kentucky
did
implement
and
recognize
the
fact
that
an
individual
cannot
be
denied
his
right
to
an
appeal,
his
right
to
present
and
marshal
those
arguments
to
an
appellate
court
through
the
negligence
and
inaction
or
whatever
of
his
attorney
and
would
reinstate
that
appeal,
then
indeed
we
have
a
situation
that
would
indeed
protect
his
rights.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
there
are
some
problems
in
regard
to
that.
if
i
may
respond
to
that
with
some
analysis
as
far
as
it
goes,
i
think
this
court...
and
essentially,
if
i
can
rephrase
your
question
somewhat,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
if
an
appellate...
if
a
court
says
we
will
reinstate
the
appeal
if
there
is
some
merit,
i
see
some
problems.
number
one,
it
would
be
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
said
previously
in
rodriguez
v.
united
states
and
lane
v.
brown.
the
court
recognized
in
those
cases
that
when
an
individual
has
lost
his
appellate
rights
through
no
fault
of
his
own,
then
he
should
be
considered
and
treated
exactly
like
any
other
appellant
once
that
appeal
is
reinstated
or
if
that
appeal
is
reinstated.
this
court
specifically
said
there
should
not
be
any
additional
hurdles
to
be
covered.
but
i
think
we
have
to
also
keep
in
mind,
justice
o'connor,
that
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
discuss
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
appeals
such
as
this,
we
have
a
circumstance
where
the
attorney
has,
because
of
an
error
on
his
part,
with
no
fault
of
the
defendant,
has
lost
that
individual's
right
to
appeal.
what
the--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--no,
your
honor.
there
is
not
necessarily
a
right
to
a
frivolous
appeal,
but
that
is
a
decision
that
can
only
be
reached
once
that
appeal
reaches
an
appellate
court,
whether
or
not
the
issues
are
frivolous
or
not.
consider
for
a
moment
what
we
have
according...
and
this
has
been
recognized
in
various
circuit
courts
of
federal
circuits
around
the
country,
specifically,
the
8th,
9th
and
11th
circuits
have
said
that
in
circumstances
where
an
individual
loses
his
appeal
because
of
an
error
of
counsel,
what
we
have
is
the
same
thing
as
if
the
individual
had
no
attorney
at
all,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
united
states
v.
cronic
just
this
spring,
what
we
have
is
the
type
of
situation
where
prejudice
has
to
be
presumed
and
cannot
be
considered
as
far
as
a
necessity
because
it
is
the
same
thing
as
the
individual
never
having
an
attorney.
that's
the
end
result
of
a
circumstance
like
mr.
lucey
had.
the
issues
were
never
considered
by
the
court,
they
never
considered
the
law
in
the
matter.
they
never
had,
as
this
court
has
said,
the
marshaling
of
arguments
for
the
individual.
so
what
we
have
is
the
type
of
situation
similar
to
what
this
court
recognized
in
u.s.
v.
cronic,
as
a
unique
type
of
case
wherein
a
person
has
either
a
total
or
a
substantive
lack
of
any
type
of
attorney
at
all.
in
that
case
you
don't
have
to
show
prejudice.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
i
think,
your
honor,
that
this
court
has
been
very
clear
as
far
as
its
holding
on
that.
i
think
that
there
can
be
a
very
legitimate
argument
that
could
be
made
to
the
court
that
there
can
be
analogized
a
constitutional
right
to
appeal,
but
i
recognize
what
this
court
has
said,
as
recently
last
year
as
barnes
v.
jones.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
i
think
that
there...
this
court
recognized
that,
in
my
opinion,
in
douglas
v.
california.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
ross
v.
moffitt,
of
course,
dealt
with
a
second
stage
of
discretionary
appeal
to
the...
for
instance,
the
supreme
court.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
with
a
second
stage
appeal,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
is...
what
we
have
in
mr.
lucey's
case--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--yes,
your
honor,
it
most
definitely
was,
with
all
due
respect.
ross
v.
moffitt
dealt
with
a
system
in
north
carolina
similar
to
what
we
have
in
kentucky.
in
ross
v.
moffitt,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
after
you
complete
the
direct
appeal--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--and
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
individual
should
be
appointed
a
counsel
on
the
second
stage
appeal,
the
discretionary
review,
or
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
and
the
conclusion
was
no.
but
this
court
distinguished
that,
and
in
its
language
specifically
recognized
that
one
of
the
reasons
there
was
no
right
to
a
counsel
on
a
discretionary
review
or
petition
for
cert
was
because
the
individual
had
already
had
an
attorney
to
present
his
arguments
to
the
court
under
the
douglas
v.
california
analysis,
and
therefore,
the
secondary
appellate
court
within
the
north
carolina
system,
similar
to
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
here
would
not
have
to
necessarily
have
the
appointment
of
counsel.
but
what
we
have,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
we
have
a
situation
that
what
we
need
to
look
at
are
and
indeed
consist
of
a
necessary
interrelationship
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
within
the
confines
of
appellate
attorney,
of
an
attorney
on
appeal.
let's
consider
for
a
moment
what
exactly
the
situation
would
be
if
my
opponent
is
right,
that
there
is
no
due
process
right
to
have
any
standards
at
all
for
appellate
attorneys,
and
let's
look
at
three
cases,
if
we
can,
your
honors.
in
swenson
v.
bosler,
1967,
the
attorney
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
but
did
nothing
else.
this
court,
based
upon
an
equal
protection,
and
i
submit
also
a
due
process
analysis,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
advantage
of
counsel
in
presenting
and
marshalling
arguments
in
a
brief
and
a
legal
analysis
cannot
be
denied
to
a
criminal
defendant
because
of
his
indigency.
anders
v.
california,
also
in
'67,
setting
out
the
standards
for
appellate
counsel,
that
it
has
to
be
more
than
an
amicus
for
an
indigent.
and
this
court
said
that
what
has
to
be
done
is
that
the
indigent
must
be
given
the
same
benefits
of
someone
who
has
the
money
to
retain
counsel.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
that
is
correct,
and
the
specific
on
the
language
in
this
court
in
anders,
this
court
said
that
an
indigent
must
have
the
same,
"the
same
rights
and
opportunity
on
appeal
as
are
enjoyed
by
those
persons
who
are
able
to
afford
the
retention
of
private
counsel.
"
and
now
i
will
get
back
to
your
question
in
just
a
moment,
justice
rehnquist,
but
let's
look
at
what
happens
to
that
type
of
analysis
if
my
opponent
is
correct
that
there
are
no
standards
for
counsel,
that
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where
this
court
has
said
in
swenson,
anders,
and
also
entsminger,
that
when
you
are
looking
at
an
indigent,
a
person
without
money,
that
they
have
to
have
the
same
rights
as
a
person
standing
here
who
has
the
power
and
the
authority
and
the
money
to
retain
an
attorney.
if
we
assume
that
there
are
no
standards,
which
is
the
attorney
general's
position
here,
there
are
no
standards
for
a
retained
attorney...
and
that
is
exactly
what
he
is
saying
to
the
court...
then
what
we
have
is
that
an
indigent,
according
to
decisions
of
this
court,
has
more
rights
than
a
person
who
has
retained
an
attorney.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
well,
no,
and
my
client
was
not
indigent.
he
had
a
retained
attorney.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
yes,
justice.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
well,
but
the
question
therefore
is
does
there
exist
a
due
process
standard
by
which
this
court
or
any
court
in
kentucky
has
to
measure
the
performance
of
the
appellate
counsel.
and
what
this
court
did
in
anders,
in
entsminger,
and
in
the
swenson
case
was
to
say
indeed
there
is
at
least
some
sort
of
standard,
because
what
they
said
was
that
there
has
to
be
the
opportunity
that
a
privately
retained
individual
would
have
the
opportunity
to
present
arguments
to
the
court
in
the
form
of
legal
presentations.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
yes,
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
what
we
have
there,
your
honor,
in
my
opinion,
is
a
violation
both
of
equal
protection
and
due
process.
we
have--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--the
state
simple,
as
this
court
has
stated
in
collier
v.
sullivan,
the
mere
involvement
of
the
state
in
the
conviction
of
any
individual
is
sufficient
to
implicate
due
process
implications
for
trial
counsel.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
the
court
should
stop
the
trial
and
declare
a
mistrial
at
that
time,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
because
an
individual--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--well,
that's
a
different
circumstance,
justice.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
what
is
different
is
the
fact
that
the
attorney
has
an
obligation
to
represent
the
client
during
that
trial
proceedings,
and
unless
and
until
the
individual
concedes
and
admits
that
the
attorney,
that
he
does
not
want
an
attorney--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--i
think
the
court
does,
as
well
as
the
bar
association.
but
we
are
talking
two
things
here.
we
are
talking
constitutional
standards
and
ethical
standards
which
are
enforced
by
bar
associations.
i
think
there
is
some
sort
of
interrelationship
between
the
two,
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
interrelationships
between
those
two
aspects.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
you
are
talking
about
mr.
lucey's
case?
mr.
william
m.
radigan
well,
what...
the
court--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--no,
the
court,
not
before
it
happened.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
what
the
court
could
have
done
in
this--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--to
stop
this
from
occurring
to
begin
with?
mr.
william
m.
radigan
i
don't
think
anything.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
well,
the
court
is
responsible--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--the
court
does
not
have
the
responsibility
to
take
and
anticipate
what
an
attorney
will
or
might
do
at
some
time
in
the
future.
i
think
what
the
court
does,
has
an
opportunity
to
examine
and
evaluate
the
consequences
afterwards
of
an
action
by
an
attorney.
for
instance,
if
you
will
examine
mr.
lucey's--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--if
we
have
an
option
that
is
granted
to
a
court
to
enforce
certain
principles
or
to
enforce
certain
positions
or
requirements
by
counsel,
then
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where
the
court
has
an
option.
they
can
take
an
action
that
would
cure
that
situation
without
any
prejudice
to
the
individual
client.
for
instance,
in
mr.,
lucey's
case,
if
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
had
said,
wait
a
minute,
we
need
for
administrative
purposes
a
statement
of
appeal,
and
mr.
nixon,
appellant
counsel
who
is
retained,
you
file
that
within
five
days
or
this
appeal
will
be
dismissed,
then
what
we
have
had
is
the
court
of
appeals
taking
a
curative
action
without
negative
implications
to
the
rights
of
mr.
lucey.
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
do
that.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
dismissed
this
appeal
without
any
consideration
concerning
mr.
lucey's
rights,
and
indeed,
when
mr.
nixon
filed
a
motion
for
reconsideration
with
the
court
as
a
response
to
their
order
and
opinion,
then
he
submitted
and
tendered
to
the
court
a
statement
of
appeal
that
complied.
but
the
court
did
not
feel
that
that
was
sufficiently
curative,
and
they
dismissed
the
appeal.
what
we
have
is
an
end
result--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
what
they
can
do
is
several
actions.
if
you
will
examine
mr.
lucey's
pleadings
in
section
4
of
the...
approximately
page
27
through
29,
there
are
a
variety
of
appellate
courts
within
the
united
states,
state
courts,
generally,
but
also
some
federal
courts,
that
have
examined
situations
like
this
and
have
said
specifically
that
the
actions
can
be
taken
to
cure
the
defects
without
prejudicing
the
client.
for
instance,
in
mr.
lucey's
case,
if
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
felt
that
there
was
a,
let's
say
it's
a
notice
of
appeal
problem,
to
take
it
out
of
the
statement
of
appeal,
justice
rehnquist,
but
let's
say
it's
a
notice
of
appeal
problem,
that
it
wasn't
timely,
what
the
court
can
do,
and
we
have
court
decisions
cited
in
mr.
lucey's
brief,
that
what
they
do
is
indeed
dismiss
the
appeal.
but
they
remand
it
in
the
same
orderly--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--i'm
saying
simply--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--i'm
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--they
can
do
that,
your
honor,
but
they
can
do
it
in
a
manner
in
which
mr.
lucey's
rights
and
his
personal
decision
to
appeal
his
conviction
would
not
be
harmed
in
the
end
result.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
the
rules
would
be
enforced.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
what
you
do
is
while
you
are
enforcing
the
rules,
you
remand
it,
as
justice
o'connor
recognized,
as
kentucky
courts
have
recognized
in
stahl
v.
commonwealth
as
a
possible
solution,
you
remand
it
to
the
trial
court
and
you
say
you
start
over,
and
yet
follow
the
rules
this
time.
and
you
appoint,
if
necessary...
and
other
courts
have
done
this...
you
appoint
if
necessary--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--no,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
i
am
saying
that
mr.--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--if
the
rule
is
made
retroactive?
which
rule...
i'm
not
sure
which
rule
you
mean.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
oh,
the
deficiency
notice
that
they
are
doing
now.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
if
that
had
been
in
existence
at
the
time,
we
would
have
been
fine,
but
it
wasn't.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lucey
still
wouldn't
have
an
appeal.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
he
would
still
be
denied
his
appeal.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
because
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
circumstance.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
i
want
this
court
to
say
that
mr.
lucey
has
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
on
appeal,
that
when
he
is
denied
that
due
process
right,
that
indeed,
what
should
occur
is
that
there
should
be
an
appeal
granted
him
anew,
that
he
begin
again
and
have
the
right
to
have
his
appeal,
his
conviction
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
certainly,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
unfortunately,
justice
stevens--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--well,
your
honor,
i
hate
to
do
this,
but
if
i
can
refer
you
to
a
case
called
in
re
radigan,
which
is
cited
in
mr.
lucey's
brief,
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
used
me
as
an
example
of
that.
at
that
time
i
was
working
at
the
public
defender
office
in
frankfort
as
an
appellate
attorney
where
i
had
worked
for
about
nine
years,
and
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
directed
me
to
file
a
brief
within
a
specified
period
of
time.
i
said
to
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
in
a
hearing
in
front
of
them,
i
can't,
i
have
too
many
cases.
and
they
said,
i'm
sorry,
mr.
radigan,
you
are
in
contempt
of
court,
and
but
because
you
are
a
fine
attorney
who
we
have
known
for
a
long
time,
we
will
withhold
the
rendition
of
that
fine
over
you.
so
yes,
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky,
as
i
well
know,
has
the
right
to
go
ahead
and
have
enforcement
of
its
rules
through
chastising
its
attorneys.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
i
can't
say
as
of
today,
your
honor.
i
can
say
as
of
ten
days
ago.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
if
the
court
wishes,
i
will
supplement
this--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--certainly,
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
certainly.
mr.
william
m.
radigan
i
would
be
more
than
glad
to,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
situation
is
essentially
what
we
have
had
in
the
past,
what
this
court
in
douglas
v.
california
said,
was
that
an
appeal
without
an
attorney
is
a
meaningless
ritual.
i
would
submit
to
the
court--
mr.
william
m.
radigan
--oh,
my
apologies,
your
honor.
