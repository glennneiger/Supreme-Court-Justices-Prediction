mr.
henry,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
you
have
just
informed
the
court
by
letter
a
day
or
so
ago
that
this
man
has
now
been
placed
on
parole,
and
you
call
the
court's
attention
to
it.
but
you
will
address
the
question
at
some
point
as
to
whether
or
not
this
renders
this
moot.

e.
burger
mr.
radigan?
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
he
were
indicted
and
went
to
trial
on
some
other
charge,
could
the
conviction,
the
one
now
under
discussion,
be
used
to
impeach
his
testimony?
chief
justice
burger
then
that
is
still
quite
a
burden,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
you
will
advise
the
court
by
letter,
with
a
copy
to
your
friend,
of
course.

justice

are
out
of
