as
long
as
you're
interrupted,
mr.
henry,
and
in
somewhat
the
same
vein,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
has
suggested
in
the
stahl
case
that
the
proper
remedy
when
an
appeal
is
denied
or
dismissed
because
of
counsel's
error
is
for
the
trial
court
to
have
some
new
proceeding
and
allow
a
new
appeal.
so
it
sounds
as
though
the
practice
in
kentucky
under
these
circumstances
might
reach
the
same
end
result
as
the
sixth
circuit
did,
in
other
words,
normally
allowing
a
new
appeal
when
counsel
has
erred,
as
here.
is
that
the
practice
in
kentucky
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
the
opinion
isn't...
doesn't
really
go
into
it
with
much
clarity,
but
did
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
not
say
that
it
recognized
the
due
process
right
to
the
effective
assistance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
i
had
rather
assumed
that
was
the
basis,
but
it
doesn't
cite
much
authority,
and
it's
a
little
unclear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
that
saying
it's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
doesn't
answer
the
inquiry
because
you
then
have
to
say
does
the
constitution,
what
does
the
constitution
require
happen
as
a
result
of
counsel's
error,
do
you
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
could...
is
it
possible
that
as
long
as
the
state
has
some
recognized
procedure
by
virtue
of
another
application
after
the
dismissal
of
the
appeal
to
get
some
review
or
relief
or
a
delayed
appeal,
possibly,
under
those
circumstances,
is
that
enough
to
meet
any
due
process
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
well,
so...
well,
that's
my
inquiry.
now,
if
what
we
are
looking
at
is
a
due
process
argument,
can
we
say
that
a
defendant
has
due
process
so
long
as
the
state
has
some
reasonable
procedure
for
instituting
a
delayed
right
of
appeal
in
the
event
of
circumstance
such
as
this,
and
doesn't
kentucky
have
such
a
procedure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
agree
that
for
a
defendant
under
mr.
lucey's
circumstances
today
in
kentucky
there
wouldn't
be
a
due
process
problem
because
of
kentucky's
new
procedure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that...
just,
i
don't
want
to
pursue
this
unduly,
but
let's
suppose
the
state
added
a
feature
to
the
effect
that
we
will
allow
a
delayed
appeal
if
there
appears
to
be
some
arguable
basis
for
it,
is
that
enough?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
saying
that
fundamental
fairness
under
the
due
process
clause
carries
with
it
a
right
to
file
a
frivolous
appeal?
