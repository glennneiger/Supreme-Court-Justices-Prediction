justice
jr.
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
answer
if
he
were
to
get
up
today
and
say
my
client's
no
longer
interested
in
the
habeas
petition?
justice
jr.
or
perhaps
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
i'm
not
going
to
press
it.
justice
jr.
well,
now,
as
i
understand
it,
as
you
said
that
he
has
been
restored
to
his
civil
rights
and
finished
his
sentence,
and
he's
been
discharged,
hasn't
he?
justice
jr.
well,
in
that
circumstance,
he
might
have
no
further
interest
in
this
habeas
petition,
might
he
not?
i
should
perhaps
be
asking
him.
justice
jr.
but
i
just
wondered
if
he
were
to
do
that,
whether
your
answer
to
us
would
be
any
different.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
radigan,
your
time
is
about
up.
may
i
get
back
because
i
didn't
understand
when
we
were
talking
about
the
mootness
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mentioned
that
you
had
consulted
with
your
client
about
ten
days
ago.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
telling
us
today
that
he
wants
you
to,
as
of
today,
not
as
of
ten
days
ago,
continue
with
the
defense
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
would
make
a
difference
to
me
on
the
mootness
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
least
for
my
benefit,
i
wish
you
would
find
out.
justice
jr.
i
would
like
to
know
whether
he
wants
you
to
persist
in
this.
