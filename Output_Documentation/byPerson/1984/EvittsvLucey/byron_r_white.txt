justice
white
well,
the
only
thing
that
interfered
with
the
state's
interest
in
this
case
was
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
right?
justice
white
and
if
we
held
that
the
case
was
moot,
we
would
vacate
the
district
court's
judgment,
the
court
of
appeals
and
direct
the
district
court's
judgment
to
be
vacated,
in
which
event
there
would
be
no
threat
to
the
state.
the
slate
would
be
wiped
clean.
justice
white
well,
that
may
indeed
be,
but
nevertheless,
the
precedential
value
of
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
would
be
eliminated,
certainly.
justice
white
wiping
the
slate
clean
would
also
leave
the
defendant
subject
to
these
collateral
consequences.
justice
white
which
he
is
not
subject
to
now
unless
we...
if
we
affirmed,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
those
collateral
consequences.
justice
white
unless
the
state--
justice
white
--but
if
the
state
didn't,
he
would
be
in
effect
discharged
from
those
collateral
consequences.
justice
white
yes,
thank
you.
justice
white
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
this
right
arose
out
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
white
it
didn't.
justice
white
well,
what
about...
i
take
it
there
is
no
claim
of
a
denial
of
equal
protection
in
this
case.
was
that
stipulated?
justice
white
you
were
lucky.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
still--
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
enough
to
keep
this
case
alive?
justice
white
well,
it
can't
be
with
respect
to
him.
justice
white
well,
that's
the
rule.
that's
the...
that
it
can't
be
just
capable
of
repetition
with
respect
to
some
other
person.
justice
white
what
about
ross
v.
moffitt?
justice
white
nevertheless,
it
said
that
a
state
didn't
need
to
furnish
counsel
in
connection
with
appeal.
justice
white
you're
just
looking
at
the
facts
of
the
case.
that
isn't
what
the
language
of
the
court
was,
is
it?
justice
white
i
know
what
the
issue
was.
justice
white
--you
conceded
apparently
that
there
is
no
equal
protection
violation.
justice
white
so
that--
