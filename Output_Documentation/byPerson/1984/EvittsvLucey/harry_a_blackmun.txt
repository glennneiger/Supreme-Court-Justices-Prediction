justice
blackmun
mr.
henry,
in
the
opposing
brief
is
a
citation
of
a
case
from
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
called
england
v.
somebody,
spalding.
justice
blackmun
and
it
is
not
cited
in
either
of
your
briefs.
do
you
have
anything
to
say
about
that
case
as
you
are
discussing
your
opponent's
brief?
justice
blackmun
it
seems
to
hold
against
you,
and
i
wondered
about
your
comments.
justice
blackmun
mr.
henry,
let
me
go
back
to
england
v.
spalding,
and
this
is
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
in
1970
which
at
that
time
was
your
state
supreme
court.
you
have
changed
the
name
since
then,
i
think.
am
i
not
correct?
justice
blackmun
court
of
appeals.
justice
blackmun
that
is
correct,
and
this
is
what
i
am
reading,
then,
from
your
state's
top
court
in
1970.
we
do
not
consider
the
failure
of
appellants
to
specify
in
their
statement
of
appeal
the
supplemental
judgment
entered
december
26,
'67
as
being
fatal
to
the
appeal.
now,
you
do
not
cite
this
case,
and
i
would
like
to
know
somewhere
along
the
line,
either
by
supplemental
letter,
how
you
distinguish
that
language
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
justice
blackmun
of
course,
there's
another
sentence
i
didn't
read,
and
that
was
that
the
section
is
designed
to
assist
this
court
in
processing
records,
and
compliance
is
not
jurisdictional.
justice
blackmun
mr.
radigan,
i
didn't
follow
you.
what
do
you
mean
his
sentence
has
been
eliminated?
