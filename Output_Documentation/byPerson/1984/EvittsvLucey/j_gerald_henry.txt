mr.
j.
gerald
henry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
comes
for
review
from
the
6th
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
involves
a
state
prisoner's
habeas
corpus
claim
of
constitutional
deprivation
on
state
appeal.
the
question
presented
for
resolution
today
is
whether
there
is
any
constitutional
impediment
to
dismissal
of
a
state
appeal
for
failure
of
retained
appellate
counsel
to
follow
the
rules
of
procedure,
and
a
specific
portion
of
that
question
is
whether
under
the
constitution
there
is
any
entitlement
to
effective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
on
state
appeal.
the
holding
of
the
sixth
circuit
was
that
indeed
there
is
a
right
to
effective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
on
state
appeal.
before
we
list
the
facts,
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
we
in
arguing
this
matter
will
address
the
sixth
amendment
as
to
the
possible
right
of
effective
assistance
on
state
appeal,
and
as
to
the
due
process
implications,
we
will
look
at
two
lines
of
cases
of
this
court,
the
mckane
line
and
the
griffin-douglas
line,
and
we
would
suggest
harmonizing
of
those
lines,
apparent
differences
in
cases
like
ross
v.
moffitt.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
i
learned
about
it,
your
honor,
i
learned
of
this
last
week
for
the
first
time
and
submitted
authority
with
my
letter.
our
position
is
that
the
question
may
be
considered
by
the
court,
that
it
is
not
moot
even
though
mr.
lucey,
the
respondent,
has
been
finally
discharged
from
parole,
and
indeed,
his
civil
rights
have
been
restored.
the
reason
for
that
is...
there
are
several
reasons.
when
this
action
started
in
the
district
court,
when
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed,
he
in
fact
at
that
time
was
in
custody.
there
exists
the
possibility
of
some
collateral
consequences
as
long
as
this
conviction
remains.
if
he
were
to
go
to
trial,
there's
the
possibility
of
impeachment
from
that
conviction,
could
be
considered
at
sentencing,
and
in
terms
of
kentucky
procedure,
if
the
trial
were
there,
under
our
persistent
felony
offender
statute,
any
sentence
he
might
receive
could
be
enhanced.
in
addition,
the
commonwealth
is
under
orders
which
are
stayed
in
this
matter
to
either
grant
mr.
lucey
a
new
trial
or
to
somehow
reinstate
his
appeal.
and
as
we
read
the
cases
submitted,
strickland
especially,
and
the
ones
following,
it
appears
that
there
almost
exists
perhaps
a
presumption
that
under
these
circumstances
collateral
legal
consequences
will
occur,
not
that
they
definitely
will,
but
a
presumption
perhaps.
we
think--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--it
would
make
a
difference
from--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--the
way
you,
the
way
you
look
at
it
from
his
point
of
view,
but
i
think
a
what
happens
should
be
uniquely
within
the
knowledge
of
mr.
lucey,
and
if
he
were
going
to
go
down
and
say
that
today,
hopefully
that
position
would
have
been
taken
long
ago
rather
than
having
him
come
in
today.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
the
possibility--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--it
would
not
from
our
point
of
view,
your
honor,
particularly
because
we
are
under
orders
to
do
a
definite
act,
and
particularly
because
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings,
the
conviction
is
there
to
be
dealt
with.
we
think
those
are
valid
interests.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
that
was
an
intervening
thing,
and
when
that
commenced--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--perhaps
not
in
this
particular
case
but
this
issue
has,
if
i
might
be
frank,
been
quite
burdensome
to
us.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
that
may
be
the
case,
and
it
was
that
possibility,
your
honor,
which
prompted
me
to
bring
in--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--it
would
indeed.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
well--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--depending
on
how
the
state
did
it,
the
possibility
of
an
appeal
could
go
forward
and
be
affirmed.
at
least
there
would--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--that
is
arguably
what
could
happen,
your
honor.
i
could
not
deny
that.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
the
facts
underlying
the
questions
are
straightforward.
mr.
lucey
was
tried
before
a
jury
in
a
kentucky
circuit
court,
and
he
was
found
guilty
of
trafficking
in
lsd
and
cocaine.
he
timely
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky.
he
filed
a
brief
on
appeal
in
that
court
in
which
he
raised
three
claims
of
error
in
the
trial
court.
his
retained
appellate
attorney,
however,
did
not
comply
with
the
rule
regarding
statement
of
appeal,
and
because
of
that,
the
appeal
ultimately
was
dismissed
without
making
a
decision
on
the
claim
mr.
lucey
raised.
his
attempts
to
combat
that
in
the
kentucky
courts
were
unavailing.
he
then
went
into
the
district
court
with
his
habeas
corpus
claim
that
he
was
deprived
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
on
appeal.
the
petitioners
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
court,
and
the
ultimate
result
of
that
is
the
holding
of
that
court,
which
is
that
there
is
a
due
process
right
to
effective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
on
state
appeal.
we
disagree
with
that,
as
we
have
set
out,
and
our
argument
will
be
based
in
two
ways,
examining
what
we
see
as
the
reality
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
examining
the
two
lines
of
cases
that
i
mentioned
earlier.
but
before
doing
that,
if
i
may,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
briefly
examine
mr.
lucey's
brief
for
what
we
consider
some
important
agreements
by
him
with
some
of
our
basic
positions.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
dealing
with
the
statement
of
appeal.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
i
would
respond
in
two
ways.
the
practice
in
kentucky
is
that
almost
all,
according
to
my
experience
and
observation,
almost
all
orders
of
dismissal
are
brief,
and
they
are
not
to
be
published,
so
there
are
in
reality
not
many
opinions
in
kentucky
discussing
any
particular
aspect
relating
to
that.
there
are
some,
but
most
of
them
are
by
unpublished
order.
and
the
facts
in
the
case
you
referred
to,
your
honor,
seemed
to
be
most
unlike
the
facts
here
in
that
in
england,
almost
all,
substantially
all
of
the
information
was
required
in
the
document...
or
i'm
sorry,
almost
all
the
information
was
placed
in
the
document.
there
was
one
departure
which
the
court
deemed
insignificant
to
following
the
rule.
here,
no
document
at
all
was
tendered,
and
none
of
this
information
was
assembled
in
one
document
before
the
court.
mr.
lucey
has
several
times
stated
that
nevertheless,
the
information
could
be
found
within
his
brief.
there
are
two
difficulties
with
that,
i
would
submit,
and
they
are
that
no
court
has
ever
agreed
with
that
contention,
and
i
would
submit
that
while
some
information
is
in
the
brief,
other
required
information
is
not.
and
in
any
event,
we
would
further
submit
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
the
rule
which
was
not
followed
is
to
put
in
one
document
the
required
information
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
judicial
economy
so
they
could
quickly
find
out
a
number
of
things
the
court
thinks
to
be
important.
the
first
is
you
have
to
put
or
you
should
put
in
the
document
when
the
judgment
was
entered
and
where
in
the
record
it
can
be
found.
in
tandem
with
that
is
the
notice
of
appeal.
this
very
quickly
let's
the
appellate
court
know
if
the
appeal
jurisdictionally
is
properly
before
the
court.
then
it
tells
the
court
if
there
are
good
reasons
to
advance,
if
there
should
be
consolidation,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
we
think
that
is
a
fair
interest
of
the
state.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
your
honor,
the
practice
in
kentucky
i
believe
can
best
be
characterized
as
in
disarray
because
of
this
type
of
case.
i
would
submit
as
my
first
evidence
of
that
the
face
of
the
stahl
opinion
itself.
i
believe
examination
of
it
will
suggest
three
approaches
to
this,
one
in
the
collateral
attack
court
or
the
trial
court,
the
possibility
of
a
belated
appeal
in
appellate
court.
but
after
all
that
is
said
and
done,
the
end
of
the
case
is
the
kentucky
supreme
court
wants
the
rules
followed,
and
that
unless
the
rules
are
followed,
this
cannot
be
done.
the
genesis
of
this
line
of
cases,
if
i
may
say
so,
i
believe,
is
the
hammershoy
case
in
kentucky.
that
i
submit
is
an
equal
protection
case,
and
that
marked
a
change
in
the
kentucky
method
of
dealing
with
this.
it
is
an
equal
protection
case,
and
examination
will
show
that
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
was
trying
to
give
fidelity
to
equal
protection
decisions
of
this
court
and
cited
them
and
said,
number
one,
we
had
always
thought
the
procedure
for
handling
this
was
different.
nevertheless,
the
supreme
court
suggests
otherwise,
and
we
will
accommodate
that.
then
it
said
we
are
not
really
sure
that
we
understand
what
the
supreme
court
has
said,
but
as
best
we
can,
we
elect
to
give
fidelity
to
that
and
do
the
best
we
can.
so
i
would
submit
that
the
stahl
question
is
a
valid
one,
but
if
you
will
read
the
three
parts,
on
the
face
of
it
i
believe
you
will
get
a
good
indication
of
the
disarray
which
exists,
and
i
would
submit
that
it
is
because
of
this
case
which
in
the
sixth
circuit
had
its
genesis
in
cleaver
and
gilbert.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
in
1970
our
high
court
was
called
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
after
our
judicial
amendment
in
the
mid-1970s,
our
high
court
is
now
called
the
supreme
court,
our
immediate
appellate
court,
which
came
into
existence--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--the
way
i
distinguish
it,
your
honor...
and
i
will
be
pleased
to
submit
a
supplemental
letter
in
addition...
is
that
in
england
v.
spalding
the
party
did
in
fact
file
the
required
statement
of
appeal
and
did
in
fact,
on
the
facts,
put
in
all
the
information,
as
i
read
the
case,
with
a
minor
exception
which
was
that
supplemental
judgment.
and
because
of
that,
as
i
analyzed
the
case,
it
was
deemed
to
have
been
complied
with.
i
have
read
that
case,
and
my
notation
in
the
brief
is
that
they
did
file
a
statement.
it
was
almost
complete
except
for
that
one
point.
here
they
did
not
file
the
statement,
and
none
of
that
information
was
in
the
document.
i
of
course
could
misunderstand
the
case,
but
i
have
read
it,
and
that
is
what
i've
indicated
at
page
10
of
mr.
lucey's
brief
as
the
way
to
distinguish
it.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
in
the
sense
of
trial
jurisdiction
and
appellate
jurisdiction,
that
is
correct.
nevertheless,
kentucky
has
a
longstanding
policy
of
strict
enforcement
of
its
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
particular
instance
is
not
jurisdictional,
it's
just
the
traditional
policy
of
kentucky
to
strictly
enforce
this
rule,
and
that
is
what
kentucky
has
done
insofar
as
it
has
been
able
to.
above,
i
agree
that
it
is
not
jurisdictional
in
the
sense
of
whether
the
power
rests
in
the
trial
or
in
the
appellate
court.
whether
the
kentucky
policy
and
tradition,
that
is
not
a
determination
of
exhaustion,
strict
exhaustion
may
not
be
jurisdictional,
but
it
is
to
be
strictly
complied
with
in
a
different
context,
in
further
support
of
my
answer.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
it
did
indeed,
following
the
policy
in--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--yes,
it
is.
it
was
when
this
lucey
question
arose,
and
it
still
is.
mr.
lucey
then
sought
discretionary
review
in
our
supreme
court,
which
is
our
court
of
last
resort,
and
that
court
not
only
declined
the
invitation
for
discretionary
review,
but
i
think
the
record
will
indicate,
your
honor,
that
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
is
affirmed,
and
this
too
would
be
an
indicate
that
the
supreme
court
wanted
to
see
the
rules
strictly
enforced.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
our
courts
insofar
as
possible
try
to
be
in
accord
with
the
equal
protection
pronouncements
of
this
court.
and
i
go
back
to
hammershoy.
i
do
not
try
to
avoid
your
question,
but
a
reading
of
hammershoy
i
would
submit
is
that
there
is
some
difficulty
by
our
court
of
understanding
the
implications
of
that.
they
try
to
grant
all
minimal
access
to
the
appellate
process,
to
the
indigents,
that
is--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--indigent
in
the
sense
that
he
had
perhaps
appointed
public
defender
counsel?
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
my
observation
and
experience
is
appeals
are
dismissed
regardless
of
whether
counsel
is
retained
or
appointed
so
long
as
the
rules
simply
are
not
followed.
the
rule
is
neutral,
and
the
court
attempts
to
apply
it
neutrally,
and
indeed,
they
have
dismissed
appeals
where
representation
was
by
appointed
counsel,
and
they
have
dismissed
appeal
by
retained
counsel.
i
think
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
regardless,
absent
some
facts
suggesting
equal
protection
in
one
or
another.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
our
sixth
amendment
analysis
is
this,
our
analysis
of
the
so-called
right
found
by
the
sixth
circuit
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
on
appeal.
our
best
indication
is
that
neither
mr.
lucey
nor
the
courts
below
explained
the
source
of
the
right
that
they
asserted.
it
seems
to
us
that
any
such
right
would
arise
out
of
the
sixth
amendment
if
it
exists,
and
our
reading
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
its
most
literal
and
explicit
sense
is
that
it
applies
in
the
trial,
fundamental
trial
arena,
rather
than
in
the
nonfundamental
appellate
arena,
just
based
on
the
language
of
that
amendment.
it
speaks
of
a
criminal
prosecution
where
there
is
an
accused,
where
there
is
a
public
trial
before
the
jury.
it
explicitly
provides
counsel
to
assist
the
defense
of
the...
the
accused
defense
of
the
prosecution.
appeal
is
not
mentioned.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
explain
the
source
of
the
right.
that
is
a
difficulty,
and
we
believe
one
which
cannot
reasonably
be
overlooked
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
no
explanation.
we
suggested
in
our
brief
that
the
only
way
to
get
the
sixth
amendment
counsel
right
under
the
appellate
setting
is
to
somehow
find
that
appeal
and
trial
are
the
same,
that
appeal
is
somehow
a
critical
stage.
we
under
our
analysis,
that
cannot
be
done,
under
ross
v.
moffitt,
for
example,
because
trial
and
appeal
are
significantly
different.
trial
tries
to
convert
a
defendant,
presumed
innocent,
into
one
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
on
the
other--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does
indeed,
due
process
right
to
effective
assistance.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
this
court
didn't
either.
neither
does
mr.
lucey,
and
this
has
been
litigated
in
terms
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
if
its
the
fourteenth
amendment
being
used
as
a
conduit
to
the
states,
if
it
isn't
in
the
sixth
amendment,
i
would
submit
that
it
just
does
not
exist
in
the
constitution
because
explicitly
that
amendment
refers
explicitly
to
counsel
in
the
fundamental
trial
arena.
that
is
a
grave
difficulty
with
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit,
and
i
would
submit
a
failure
of
mr.
lucey
here
in
brief
to
directly
address
that
troubling
reality.
our
due
process
analysis
in
its
more
general
sense
relies
on
two
lines
of
cases,
the
mckane,
which
comes
right
on
up
until
the
present
day,
and
the
griffin-douglas
line
of
cases.
the
mckane
case
is
saying
there
is
no
due
process
entitlement
at
all
at
the
state
court
appeal,
and
the
griffin-douglas
line
of
cases
using
due
process
and
equal
protection
language,
and
we
would
submit
causing
a
good
deal
of
trouble
in
understanding
these
lines
of
cases.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
by
stipulation
of
the
parties,
there
is
no
equal
protection
issue
here,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
in
a
sense,
i
was,
but
i
would
say
of
opposing
counsel,
for
his
benefit,
i
think
he
made
the
correct,
factually
correct
decision
and
recognized
the
reality
of
it,
and
i...
it's
more
than
luck.
i
think
it
is
a
competent
decision
and
judgment
by
mr.
radigan--
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
--to
be
candid
about
it.
but
yes,
indeed,
it
does
help
me
in
the
sense
that
i
don't
have
to
deny
that
it
exists
and
attack
the
evidence.
the
benefit
we
see
to
the
ross
v.
moffitt
case
is
we
think
it
explains
and
harmonizes
the
differences,
no
due
process
in
mckane,
some
due
process,
griffin-douglas,
and
it
does
it
this
way.
we
believe
that
it
finds
that
due
process
in
the
griffin-douglas
line
of
cases
exists
in
tandem
only
with
equal
protection,
if
equal
protection
exists.
but
steps,
the
way
it
does
that,
it
starts
and
says
that
neither
due
process
clause
nor
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
itself
satisfactorily
explains
the
result
of
the
griffin-douglas
cases.
it
goes
on
to
define
fairness
in
terms,
traditional
terms,
and
defines
equal
protection
as
to
disparity.
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
key
to
this
in
harmonizing
it,
and
later
on
we
submit
not
to
extending
it,
is
this
quotation
from
ross.
unfairness
results
only
if
indigents
are
singled
out
by
the
state
and
denied
meaningful
access
to
the
appellate
system
because
of
their
poverty.
this
question
is
more
profitably
considered
under
an
equal
protection
analysis.
that
just
reiterates
that
due
process
as
it
is
mentioned
in
the
griffin-douglas
lines
of
cases
exists
only
in
tandem
with
an
actual
existence
of
an
equal
protection
violation
or
disparity.
so
whereas
here
or
in
any
case,
if
there
is
no
equal
protection
in
existence,
then
there
is
no
existence
of
due
process
either
because
neither
by
itself
supports
the
result
reached;
they
must
act
in
tandem.
thus,
absent
equal
protection
there
is
an
absence
of
due
process,
and
ross
v.
moffitt
is
nicely
explained,
and
more
importantly,
harmonized,
two
important
lines
of
cases,
and
i
think
along
the
way
it
suggested
an
unwillingness
to
extend
griffin
and
douglas
farther,
and
i
think
definitely
we
should
not
add
a
whole
new
layer
of
appellate
effective
counsel
claims.
if
there
is
fundamental
constitutional
deprivation
at
state
trial,
raise
that
as
always
in
the
habeas
corpus
court
directly
and
don't
do
it
directly
and
eat
up
a
lot
of
time
and
raise
a
lot
of
troubling
new
questions,
was
counsel's
brief
bad,
should
he
have
raised
the
brief,
a
question
that
he
didn't,
should
he
have
raised
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
all
things
like
this.
it
is
a
very,
very
disturbing
area
to
get
into,
and
it's
potential.
any
time
i
have,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
request
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
gerald
henry
i
waive
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
