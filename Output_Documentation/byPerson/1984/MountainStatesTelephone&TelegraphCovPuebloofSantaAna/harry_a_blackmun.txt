ms.
krause,
am
i
correct,
however,
no
answer
was
ever
filed
in
that
suit?
justice
blackmun
that
is
my
difficulty
as
to
where
one
draws
the
line.
why
does
the
s.g.
just
go
so
far
and
not
any
further?
what
is
the
justification
for
his
stopping
short
of
going
all
the
way?
justice
blackmun
mr.
borg,
really,
how
important
is
this
case?
justice
blackmun
what
hangs
on
our
decision
here?
justice
blackmun
that
philosophically
sounds
very
broad,
but
how
much
is
involved
really,
just
a
few
easements?
justice
blackmun
well,
i
am
just
wondering,
what
justifies
what
must
be
substantial
expense
in
getting
this
case
up
here
if
all
we
are
talking
about
are
nominal
damages
and
a
few
rights-of-way
to
provide
as
easements,
go
back
in
the
30's
really.
justice
blackmun
is
this
a
lawyer's
lawsuit?
justice
blackmun
is
there
anything
else
behind
this,
anything
by
way
of
water
rights
or
other
things
that
are
more
substantial?
justice
blackmun
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get
out
and
i
don't
get
it
from
you.
justice
blackmun
of
course,
sometimes
people
don't
want
federal
protection.
