mr.
scott
e.
borg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
entire
history
of
indian
affairs
in
this
country,
congress
has
never
given
the
secretary
of
the
interior
unbridled
discretion
to
approve
conveyances
of
unallotted,
unseeded
tribal
lands
and
yet
petitioner
would
have
this
court
enshrine
an
interpretation
of
section
17
of
the
pueblo
lands
act
as
a
wholesale
transfer
of
congress'
own
power
over
conveyances
of
pueblo
tribal
land
transactions.
section
17
is
one
of
the
last
sections
of
a
statute
passed
in
1924
of
quiet
pueblo
titles
and
validate
the
titles
of
a
very
carefully
limited
group
of
non-indian
settlers
that
congress
decided
deserved
to
have
their
titles
validated
under
the
procedures
of
this
act.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
yes.
each
of
these
transfers
or
so-called
transfers
has
been
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
yes,
but
not
with
the
consent
of
congress.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
congress...
the
idea
is
that
congress
under
the
non-intercourse
act
must
authorize
conveyances
of
indian
land.
it
has
never
given
carte
blanche
power
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
a
group.
in
fact,
the
continuous
and
consistent
practice
of
congress
has
been
to
allow
only
conveyances
of
very
limited
interest
in
indian
land
and
congress
itself
has
imposed
statutory
conditions
on
such
conveyances
and
has
required
regulations.
section
17,
on
the
other
hand,
does
not
limit
in
any
manner
the
kinds
of
conveyances
of
pueblo
indian
land
that
can
be
made.
it
imposes
no
conditions
whatever
on
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or
the
tribes
and
it
does
not
even
require
the
issuance
of
regulations.
moreover,
it
does
not
require
that
the
indians
receive
just
compensation
and,
in
fact,
one
of
the
problems
that
developed
in
the
use
of
section
17
was
improvident
conveyances.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
did
not
give
adequate
authority
and
that
has
been
recognized
by
congress
in
carefully
retaining
unto
itself
that
kind
of
authority
over
the
disposal
and
conveyance
indian
lands
and
not
giving
the
secretary
such
a
massive
transfer
of
its
own
authority.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
section
16
does
give
congressional
approval
for
a
carefully
limited
kind
of
transaction.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
no.
the
point
is
that
section
16
gives
congressional
authority
for
a
very
limited
type
of
transaction.
it
involves
lands
situated
away
from
the
main
body
of
pueblo
lands,
little
splinters
that
are
isolated
and
are
no
longer
of
much
value
to
the
indians.
congress
gave
its
consent
for
those
lands
to
be
sold
in
order
for
pueblo
lands
to
be
consolidated
and
to
bring
their
own
land
holdings
into
better
shape.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
right.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
no,
those
are
not
the
same
conditions
because...
not
precisely
the
same
conditions
because
section
17
does
not
impose
any
requirement
that
the
transaction
be
judged
in
the
best
interest
of
the
indians
as
does
section
16.
it
does
not
require
the
issuance
of
regulations
as
does
section
16
and
it
does
not
require
that
it
be
by
auction
to
the
highest
bidder
as
does
section
16.
section
16
is
a
very
carefully
limited
provision.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
no.
the
pueblo
lands
are
not
allotted
lands.
they
are
held
in
communal
title
the
same
as
any
other
indian
lands
except
the
pueblo
has
fee
simple
title
to
it.
neither
of
those--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--it
seems
to
contemplate
such
ownership
in
the
future
and
i
would
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
mountain
bell
does
not
do
anything
to
explain
that
particular
clause,
the
second
clause
of
section
17.
we
believe
that
that
clause
has
a
rational
meaning.
pueblo
lands
were
not
allotted
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
pueblo
lands
act.
congress
at
that
time
was
still
adhering
to
the
policy
of
allotment,
but
until
congress
went
ahead
and
issued
allotments
and
removed
the
restrictions
on
alienation
that
are
commonly
given
to
allotments,
individuals
couldn't
sell.
the
united
states
does
not
believe
that
individual
pueblo
indians
could
sell.
mountain
bell
says
they
could,
but
the
language
of
that
statute,
the
second
clause,
indicates
that
congress
must
act
in
the
future
to
allot
pueblo
lands
before
individuals
can
sell.
in
a
parallel
fashion,
congress
must
act
to
authorize
the
secretary
and
the
pueblos
to
convey
lands
in
any
other
matter.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
indeed.
the
authorization
that
congress
was
referring
to
for
sales
by
individuals
was
something
it
contemplated
doing
in
the
future.
likewise,
it
contemplated
in
the
future
allowing
tribal
lands
to
be
conveyed
under
various
statutes
that
congress
would
pass
allowing
the
very
limited
kinds
of
conveyances
for
rights-of-way,
for
leases,
for
other
purposes
that
congress
has
done
both
before
and
since
the
act.
the
second
clause
of
section
17
merely
references
the
existing
statutes
by
which
congress
had
already
authorized
very
limited
transactions
in
indian
land
and
it
refers
to
the
future,
both
in
allotment
and
for
tribal
lands
to
acts
of
congress
that
would
allow
future
conveyances.
the
significant
thing
about
section
17
is
that
the
first
clause
addresses
the
evil
that
congress
sought
to
remedy
in
the
pueblo
lands
act,
namely,
conveyances
and
losses
of
pueblo
land
through
adverse
possession.
the
first
clause
completely
wipes
out
any
kind
of
loss
of
pueblo
land
without
congressional
authority.
the
second
clause
simply
references
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
who
did
have
broad
supervision
over
administration
of
pueblo
lands
must
approve
transactions
when
those
transactions
must
be
approved
under
the
congressional
statute.
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
congress
would
in
the
future
pass
any
kind
of
a
statute
that
would
not
require
secretarial
approval.
as
noted
by
mountain
bell,
the
second
clause
addresses
conveyances.
congress
has
generally
required
secretarial
supervision
for
conveyances
of
allotted
indian
lands
and
further
kinds
of
transactions.
congress
was
not
going
to
pass
a
law
in
the
future
saying
that
the
pueblos
could
convey
independently
of
the
secretary.
that
has
been
a
fundamental
part
of
the
secretary's
role
in
supervising
and
managing
indian
lands
throughout
the
last
90
to
100
years.
section
17
must
be
viewed
in
a
common-sense
way.
it
must
be
viewed
as
simply
declaratory
statement
by
congress
that
the
pueblos
were
subject
to
the
full
benefits
and
protections
of
the
indian
non-intercourse
act.
the
pueblo
lands
act
sought
to
give
effect
to
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
sandoval
which
held
that
the
pueblos
were
tribal
indians
subject
to
the
same
protections
and
having
the
same
status
as
other
tribal
indians
in
this
country.
that
reversed
a
prior
decision
and
finally
gave
effect
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
1851
when
it
extended
the
non-intercourse
act
to
new
mexico
specifically
to
protect
the
pueblos.
so,
the
evil
that
congress
sought
to
remedy
in
1924
was
that
long
history
of
maybe
30
or
40
years
from
the
joseph
decision
where
the
pueblos
were
placed
in
a
unique
status,
stripped
of
the
protections
of
congressional
control
of
their
lands.
congress
had
no
reason
to
turn
around
in
the
same
act
by
which
it
had
accomplished
that
goal
and
simply
cast
the
indians
adrift,
subject
only
to
the
unbridled
discretion
of
the
secretary
or
his
lesser
subordinate.
the
interpretation
that
mountain
bell
is
advancing
here
would
authorize
conveyances
going
all
the
way
down
the
line
through
the
bureaucracy
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
transactions
and
approvals
for
leases
and
rights-of-way
even
today
are
commonly
done
at
the
agency
level
and
it
would
just
simply
be
absurd
to
presume
that
congress
intended
to
give
that
kind
of
authority
to
low-level
bureaucrats
within
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
protection
that
congress
has
historically
sought
to
give
indian
lands.
congress
has
very
jealously
retained
its
own
power
and
its
own
authority
over
unseeded,
unallotted
indian
lands,
the
lands
on
which
indians
are
living.
when
lands
have
been
seeded
or
when
lands
have
been
allotted,
congress
has
generally
allowed
some
kinds
of
broader
control
to
the
secretary,
but
that
is
part
of
the
emancipation
process
that
allotment
sought
to
promote.
earlier
that
has
been
disavowed.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
we
believe
that
reliance
is
not
called
for
at
all
to
the
administrative
interpretation.
we
think
the
language
of
the
statute,
like
the
court
of
appeals,
is
clear;
that
the
legislative
intent
of
section
17
can
be
discerned
by
looking
at
the
language
of
the
statute
and
looking--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--the
secretary's
attitude
toward
that
language
was
not
the
kind
of
attitude
that
this
court
traditionally
gives
deference.
the
interpretation
that
is
advanced
by
mountain
bell
was
arrived
at
by
private
attorneys
two
years
after
the
pueblo
lands
act
as
a
means
of
evading
the
pueblo
lands
act.
that
interpretation
was
never
communicated
to
congress
and,
in
fact,
is
inconsistent
with
other
congressional
enactments
passed
subsequent
to
that
time.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
the
secretary
did
give
approval
but
i
would
remind
you
that
the
approvals
were
given
to
very
irregular
conveyances.
first,
they
were
used
to--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--it
is
not
clear.
none
of
the
approvals
were
given
by
the
secretary
himself.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
no,
i
would
not
say
that
the
secretary
knew
how
he
was
acting.
the
secretary
never
approved
a
single
conveyance.
they
were
all
approved
by
assistant
secretaries
below
him.
this
interpretation--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--well,
this
interpretation...
i
suppose
it
is.
this
interpretation
did
not
originate
in
any
kind
of
judicious
process
by
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
be
discerned.
it
came
from
private
attorneys.
it
was
acquiesced
in
doubtfully
by
local
federal
officials
in
new
mexico
who
then--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--we
do
not
believe
that
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
a
single
congressional
committee
in
any
kind
of
direct
fashion.
it
may
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
maybe
an
isolated
congressman,
but
there
is
nothing
that
we
have
been
able
to
determine
that
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
at
all.
and,
in
fact,
congress
legislated
in
a
manner
that
is
inconsistent
with
that
interpretation.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
this
case
is
very
important,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
what
hangs
on
your
decision
here
is
whether
the
pueblo
indians
are
going
to
be
found
by
this
court
to
have
been
placed
in
a
completely
different
status
than
any
other
indian
tribe
in
this
country.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
in
practical
terms,
not
very
much,
just
a
few
easements.
mountain
bell
itself
acquired
26
rights-of-way
under
section
17.
it
has
only
one
standing
line
that
has
not
been
renegotiated.
there
are
very
few
of
these
cases
left
to
be
adjudicated.
what
is
really
at
stake
here
is
the
possibility...
probably
nominal
damages
as
shown
by
the
letter
from
judge
campos
in
new
mexico
that
is
appended
to
our
brief.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
right.
when
this
case
was
brought
we
anticipated--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--no,
this
lawsuit
was
brought
to
us
by
our
clients.
in
fact,
it
was
identified
by
the
united
states
as
a
potential
trespass
suit
under
28
u.s.c.,
sec.
2815.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
yes,
there
are
considerations--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--well,
the
effect
on
water
rights
is
an
indirect
one.
only
since
this
court
took
cert
in
this
case
in
the
lead
water
rights
adjudication
in
new
mexico
for
pueblo
indian
water
rights,
the
state
is
now
arguing
that
the
pueblo
indians
have
never
been
subject
to
the
non-intercourse
act
and
they
are
saying...
in
arguing
in
that
court
that
the
pueblos
are
somehow
to
be
treated
differently
because
congress
treated
them
differently
in
the
pueblo
lands
act
and
that
they
have
never
been
subject
to
the
non-intercourse
act,
despite
this
court's
decision
in
u.s.
v.
candelaria.
and
that
has
the
potential
for
having
great
impact
on
pueblo
indian
water
rights.
it
would
put
the
pueblos
in
a
unique
position
where
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
same
kinds
of
protections
and
the
same
kinds
of
rights
that
have
been
accorded
other
indian
tribes.
that
is
why
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
against
us
were
filed.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
indians,
your
honor,
do
want
federal
protection.
it
is
those
people
who
want
to
strip
the
indian
tribes
of
their
special
rights
and
their
special
protections
that
are
the
ones
who
are
advocating
removing
those
restrictions.
what
is
really
at
stake
for
the
companies
in
this
case
is
nominal.
pnm,
one
of
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
case,
has
negotiated
seven
of
eight
of
its
rights-of-way
and
the
remaining
one
expires
next
year.
mountain
bell,
like
i
say,
has
only
one
standing
right-of-way
that
has
not
been
renegotiated.
for
the
pueblos,
on
the
other
hand,
what
is
at
stake
is
their
very
status,
whether
they
are
to
be
treated
as
indian
tribes
like
other
indian
tribes
or
whether
they
are
somehow
to
be
cast
in
a
unique
status,
stripped
of
some
of
the
protections
that
have
been
given
to
those
other
tribes.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--yes.
well,
it
is
in
the
documents
that
we
lodged
with
the
court.
there
were
actually
more
than
64.
there
were
79
conveyances.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
and,
55
of
those
were
within
a
six-year
period
from
1926
to
about
1932.
there
were
a
couple
of
other
conveyances
around
1940
and
then
a
group
of
them
in
the
1950's
that
were
only
intended
as
a
means
of
circumventing
the
existing
secretarial
regulations
that
limited
rights-of-way
to
50
years.
the
administrative
interpretation
has
not
been
a
consistent
interpretation.
it
has
been
erratic,
it
has
been
irregular,
it
has
even
been
abandoned.
there
has
been
no
section
17
conveyance
since
1959
and
for
the
last
eight
years
the
department
of
interior
supported
our
position.
and,
in
fact,
the
united
states
has
brought
suits
based
on
this
same
statute
that...
the
same
kind
of
suit
that
is
before
you
here.
it
is
only
since
november
that
the
united
states
has
decided
to
take
a
different
position.
this
kind
of
waffling
may
not
reflect
what
the
government's
position
is
today
but
it
shows
that
there
has
been
a
relative
lack
of
consistency
in
the
interpretation
of
section
17.
one
other
thing
is
that
in
1943
the
solicitor
for
the
department
of
the
interior
advised
that
rights-of-way
were
to
be
governed
solely
by
the
general
right-of-way
statutes
and
not
by
section
17.
thereafter,
transactions
under
section
17
were
made
only
to
evade
the
existing
statutes,
made
to
evade
the
time
limits,
made
to
evade
the
limits
on
just
compensation
to
the
pueblos,
made
to
evade
limits
on
who
the
parties
could
be
to
get
those
transactions.
section
17
was
a
giant
loophole
opened
up
by
private
interests
and
acquiesced
in
reluctantly
by
local
federal
officials
in
order
to
evade
the
law
and
all
we
are
doing
in
this
suit
is
trying
to
compel--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--section
17
was
drafted
by
francis
wilson.
francis
wilson
was
not
the
lawyer
for
the
pueblo.
he
was
the
lawyer
for
one
of
the
indian
rights
organizations
that
was
active
in
lobbying
for
the
bill.
the
lawyer
for
the
pueblo
was
one
of
those
who
was
compromised
by
the
whole
thing.
he
represented
two
of
the
companies
that
wanted
to
get
rights-of-way
and
he
was
one
of
the
people
who
was
originally
involved
in
concocting
section
17
as
an
artifice
for
evading
the
act.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
francis
wilson
was
trying
to
represent
the
interest
of
a
lobbying
group
on
behalf
of
the
indians,
generally
a
fairly
wealthy
group
of
persons
in
the
early
1920's
in
new
mexico
and
in
new
york
who
wanted
to
preserve
pueblo
culture
and
pueblo
arts
and
crafts.
and,
his
interest
was
one
as
an
advocate
for
the
pueblos,
but
not
as
their
representative.
and,
francis
wilson's
statement,
which
everybody
has
been
citing,
that
section
17
was
intended
to
cover
the
same
ground
as
the
non-intercourse
act
is
clear.
section
17
does
cover
the
same
ground
as
the
non-intercourse
act.
it
was
intended
to
preserve
congress'
power.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
on
the
surface
that
might
be
true,
but
in
actuality
the
pueblos
and
indian
tribes
generally
do
not
exercise
very
much
independent
judgment
in
these
kind
of
affairs.
whether
it
is
voluntary
or
involuntary
doesn't
really
matter
because
they
generally
rely
on
the
judgment
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
the
officials
who
are
designated
to
fulfill
this
country's
guardianship
responsibilities.
they
are
not
treated
any
better
under
section
17
by
requiring
their
consent
because
the
conditions
that
congress
uniformly
imposes
on
these
kinds
of
statutes
for
conveyances
are
not
available
to
them.
for
instance,
the
railroad
statute
governing
rights-of-way
requires
that
a
commission
determine
the
compensation.
it
requires
that
if
the
pueblo
objects
they
be
given
a
full
hearing
before
it
be
granted.
it
requires
certain
types
of
widths
for
rights-of-way
and
it
requires
stations.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
some
people
might
agree.
on
the
surface
it
sounds
fine,
you
know,
requiring
pueblo
approval,
and
that
is
what
is
done
in
the
present
statutes
by
regulation
and
in
some
cases
by
statute
consent
is
required
of
indian
tribes
for
these
limited
type
conveyances.
in
the
kerr-mcgee
case,
the
question,
as
i
understand
it,
involves
whether
if
the
tribe
imposes
a
tax
on
mineral
extract
it
must
have
the
secretary's
approval.
that
is
a
different
thing
from
here.
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
alienation
of
pueblo
indian
lands.
there
the
pueblos
wants
as
much
protection
as
they
can
have.
they
do
not
want
to
have...
say,
if
a
new
leadership
comes
into
power,
if
there
is
some
kind
of
upheaval
within
the
tribal
government.
they
do
not
want
to
have
the
kind
of...
be
stripped
of
the
protections
that
other
tribes
are
given.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
or
without
the
authorization
of
congress.
that
is
definitely
true.
the
indian
tribes
are
very
protective
of
their
special
land
status.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
no.
the
pueblos
were
not
really
accorded
private
counsel
or
really
the
kind
of
assistance
that
they
have
had
in
only
the
last
ten
or
fifteen
years.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
no.
there
have
been
other
procedures
that
have
been
followed
by
the
pueblos
in
trying
to
get
the
department
of
the
interior
to
reject
that
interpretation,
and,
in
fact,
the
department
of
the
interior
itself
identified
these
trespass
cases.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
section
16
was
utilized,
but
sectio
17,
as
you--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--i
have
no
idea
of
just
how
frequently.
i
don't
think
the
issue
came
up
all
that
often,
but
section
17
was,
in
fact,
used
to
override
section
16.
the
documents
that
we
lodged
with
the
court
show
that
in
some
instances
the
lands
that
were...
the
precise
same
lands
that
should
have
been
covered
by
section
16
were
conveyed
under
section
17.
presumably...
it
is
not
clear,
but
presumably
to
avoid
the
requirement
that
they
be
put
up
for
bid
to
the
highest
bidder.
it
was
used
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
persons
who
wanted
them
got
them.
i
might
add
that
the
consideration
for
those
conveyances
was
woefully
inadequate.
some
of
them
were
on
the
edge
of
the
town
of
bernalillo
in
new
mexico
and
they
were
sold
for
seven
or
eight
dollars
an
acre,
whereas
the
appraised
value
at
the
time
was
probably
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
an
acre.
section
17
was
also
used
to
validate
some
invalid,
concededly
void
deeds
that
were
issued
in
1880
for
the
consideration
of
a
dollar
to
the
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe
railroad.
section
17
had
a
highly
irregular
use.
it
was
not
a
consistent
kind
of
administrative
practice
and
it
was
simply
used
when
no
other
statutory
authority
seemed
to
be
available.
but,
when
it
had
the
instrumental
value,
say,
of
getting
a
good
deal
and
it
is
just
something
that
was
developed
as
an
artifice.
it
was
used
as
a
mean
of
evading
the
pueblo
lands
act
and
it
is
certainly
not
worthy
of
this
court's
deference.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
the
transaction?
mr.
scott
e.
borg
the
indians
wanted
section
17
because--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--that
wanted
section
17?
mr.
scott
e.
borg
section
17
was
drafted
by
a
representative
for
a
pro
indian
organization.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
no.
statutes
have
hardly
ever
been
drafted
by
the
indians
themselves.
but,
the
section
is
one
that
the
pueblos--
mr.
scott
e.
borg
--no,
the
indians
do
not
want
to
operate
their
own
property.
they
want
to
have
some
say
in
it,
but
they
want
it
to
be
protective.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
that
is
right.
and,
that
is
why
government
regulations
and
government
policy
requires
their
consent
generally.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
sure.
i
can
name
you
our
clients,
santa
ana
pueblo.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
no,
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
tribe.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
that
is
right.
mr.
scott
e.
borg
well,
we
have
a
couple
of
tribal
members
here
today.
it
has
been...
i
don't
think
you
will
find
in
recent
legislative
history
any
effort
by
an
indian
tribe
that
is
subject
to
the
non-intercourse
act
asking
to
be
relieved
of
the
non-intercourse
act.
indian
tribes...
it
is
just
inconceivable
because
the
history
of
allotment
which
did
result
in
the
removal
of
restrictions
on
alienation
resulted
in
a
massive,
massive
loss
of
indian
land
and
that
was
rejected
and
reversed
in
1934
under
the
indian
reorganization
act.
and,
congress
has
expressly
repudiated
that
entire
policy
of
giving
indian
tribes
the
power
to
alienate
their
lands.
congress,
moreover,
had
no
reason
to
enact
section
17
as
interpreted
by
petitioner.
congress
was
informed,
as
mountain
bell
admits,
that
the
general
procedures
for
administering
and
governing
indian
lands
were
being
followed
in
1924
when
it
enacted
the
pueblo
lands
act.
congress
had
no
reason
to
provide
an
additional
means
for
providing
conveyances.
it
certainly
had
no
reason
to
cut
off
any
access
to
existing
means
for
acquiring
rights-of-way.
and,
as
i
say,
subsequent
legislation
refutes
mountain
bell's
interpretation.
in
1928,
congress
passed
a
comprehensive
statute
that
applied
the
existing
statutes
governing
rights-of-way
to
the
pueblos.
that
statute
has
been
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
a
comprehensive
statute
that
covers
the
field.
it
is
certainly
inconsistent
to
say
that
the
conditions
and
the
limits
imposed
by
that
statute,
the
1982
statute,
could
be
conveniently
circumvented
simply
by
citing
section
17
of
the
pueblo
lands
act.
in
1933,
congress
broadened
section
16
of
the
pueblo
lands
act.
there
is
not
an
iota
of
an
indication
that
congress
was
aware
that
section
17
had
been
interpreted
to
have
the
operative
effect
that
it
was
being
used
for.
congress
instead
broadened
the
scope
of
conveyances
under
section
16
but
still
left
in
all
of
the
carefully
defined
protections
that
it
had
imposed
in
the
first
place.
in
1948,
congress
passed
a
general
right-of-way
act,
specifically
mentioning
the
pueblos
and
requiring
the
consent
of
the
tribes.
if
congress
was
aware
that
section
17,
using
tribal
consent,
could
grant
rights-of-way
for
all
purposes,
it
certainly
would
not
have
referred
to
them
in
the
1948
act.
finally,
in
1968,
congress
allowed
four
specific
pueblos
to
lease
their
lands
for
99
years.
petitioner's
interpretation
of
section
17
would
allow
those
pueblos
to
do
that
without
the
benefit...
without
the
need
for
that
statute.
any
of
the
pueblos
could
have
leased
their
lands
for
99
years
or
even
have
sold
their
lands.
there
was
absolutely
no
need
in
1968
for
that
kind
of
statute
if
section
17
had
the
operative
effect
attributed
to
it.
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
three
unanimous
decisions
of
this
court,
u.s.
v.
sandavol,
u.s.
v.
candelaria,
and
u.s.
v.
chavez,
the
pueblo
indians
were
found
to
be
entitled
to
the
exact
same
status
and
the
exact
same
protections
given
other
indian
lands.
section
17
was
turned
on
its
head
and
used
to
undermine
the
non-intercourse
act
and
to
usurp
the
authority
of
congress
over
indian
affairs.
petitioner's
argument
would
have
this
court
place
the
pueblo
indians
in
a
unique
status,
stripped
of
some
of
the
same
protections
as
other
indian
lands
and
could
have
implications
beyond
this
decision
and
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
continue
those
protections
for
the
pueblo
indians.
thank
you.
