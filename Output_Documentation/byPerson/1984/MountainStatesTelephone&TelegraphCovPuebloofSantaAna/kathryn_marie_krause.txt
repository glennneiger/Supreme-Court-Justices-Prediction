ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
over
50
years
section
17
of
the
pueblo
lands
act
was
considered
to
authorize
the
public
conveyance
of
a
right-of-way
across
their
lands,
provided
only
that
that
conveyance
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
no
further
congressional
authorization
or
legislation
was
deemed
necessary.
that
was
the
interpretation
of
the
department
of
interior.
it
was
based
on
the
language
of
section
17
and
it
was
an
interpretation
that
was
put
into
practice
and
concurred
in
by
the
pueblos.
the
department
of
interior
practice
resulted
in
over
60
grants
of
rights-of-way
across
the
lands
of
the
pueblos
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
spanned
a
period
of
time
of
over
30
years.
mountain
bell
holds
such
a
section
17
right-of-way.
it
was
granted
to
it
by
the
respondent
pueblo
santa
ana
in
1928.
it
was
approved
that
same
year
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
prior
to
1928,
in
the
fall
of
1927,
mountain
bell
was
named
in
a
quiet
title
action
that
had
been
brought
under
section
3
of
the
pueblo
lands
act.
that
action
was
styled
united
states
of
america
as
guardian
for
the
pueblo
of
santa
ana
versus
charles
brown.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
defendants
held
right
titles
and
interests
to
the
lands
of
the
pueblos
or
at
least
claimed
such
interest
and
asked
that
those
interests
be
declared
null
and
void.
the
complaint
also
alleged
that
the
defendants
were
trespassing
across
the
property
of
the
pueblo
and
asked
that
the
trespass
be
enjoined
by
an
injunction.
mountain
bell
was
dismissed
from
that
lawsuit.
it
secured
a
right-of-way
from
the
pueblo
in
february
of
1928
and
within
six
weeks
the
legal
representative
representing
the
pueblos
moved
to
dismissed
mountain
bell
from
the
brown
action
on
the
grounds
that
since
the
institution
of
the
suit
mountain
bell
had
secured
good
and
sufficient
title
to
its
right-of-way
over
the
premises
and
controversy
under
section
17
of
the
pueblo
lands
act.
the
order
of
dismissal
by
the
district
court
judge
recited
substantially
similar
statements.
in
1980,
the
pueblo
of
santa
ana
sued
mountain
bell
again.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
you
are
right,
justice
blackmun,
there
was
no
answer
filed.
in
1980,
the
pueblo
again
sued
mountain
bell,
arguing
that
mountain
bell
was
in
trespass.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
i
am
sorry,
justice
stevens--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--that
is
right.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
i
think
the
order
was
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits
to
the
effect
that
mountain
bell
had
good
title
to
its
right-of-way.
i
think
the
pueblos
had
the
opportunity
through
their
legal
counsel
if
they
wanted
to
litigate
the
question
of
whether
mountain
bell
had
legal
title
or
had
been
in
trespass
prior
to
the
time
of
that
order
to
have
litigated
it
but
they
did
not.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
well,
the
order
is
dated,
i
think,
may
31,
1928.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
and
it
does
not
address
whether
it
is
speaking
about
before
or
after.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
i
think
the
court
adjudicated
the
fact
that
mountain
bell
had
good
title
as
of
that
date
for
certain
and
did
not
actually
address
whether
it
had
it
before
or
not.
i
think
our
argument
would
be
that
the
pueblo
is
precluded
probably
from
raising
whether
we
had
it
before
or
not
because
they
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
that
question
at
the
time.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
okay.
let
me
back
up
a
minute.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
i
think
the
judgment
rests
on
the
fact
that
we
had
secured
a
valid
right-of-way
from
pueblo
of
santa
ana
that
was
approved
by
the
secretary.
i
am
sorry
if
i
am
being
obtuse.
i
don't
think
i
understand
the
question
exactly.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
right.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
right.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
i
think
the
theory
that
we
had
acquired
the
right-of-way
as
of
1928
supports
the
order.
i
think
that
an
argument
could
be
made,
however--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--well--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--i
think
that
the
principles
of
res
judicata
support
that
it
bars
something
that
could
have
been
litigated
as
well
as
those
things
that
were
litigated.
and
so
to
the
extent
that
the
order
on
its
face
states
that
mountain
bell
has
a
good
and
sufficient
right-of-way
and
has
perfected
title
to
a
right-of-way,
that
it
actually
is
an
adjudication
as
to
mountain
bell's
status
as
of
that
time
which
covers
mountain
bell's
status
back
to
1904
frankly.
it
could
have
been
litigated
at
that
point
in
time
and
it
was
not.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
the
pueblo
in
1980
reputed
its
right-of-way
grant
to
mountain
bell
arguing
that
the
second
clause
of
section
17
did
not
authorize
it
to
grant
a
conveyance
to
mountain
bell,
and
that,
in
fact,
that
statute
prohibited
any
such
conduct
on
their
part.
they
renounced
the
actions
of
their
legal
representatives
in
the
brown
lawsuit
on
the
grounds
that
the
order
of
dismissal
was
intended
to
be
a
procedural
order
only
and
not
to
be
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits
and
that
the
order
by
the
trial
court
judge
did
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
the
type
of
order
that
should
be
accorded
res
judicata
effect.
the
tenth
circuit
agreed
with
the
pueblo
on
both
issues.
it
held
that
section
17
of
the
pueblo
lands
act
did
not
authorize
the
pueblo
to
convey
their
property
and
that
the
pueblo
would
not
be
authorized
to
have
granted
the
right-of-way
until
some
congress
other
than
the
68th
congress
took
some
action
to
authorize
the
pueblo
to
convey
their
property.
the
court
also
held
the
pueblo
was
not
barred
from
the
order
of
dismissal,
from
relitigating
something
it
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
in
1928
the
status
of
mountain
bell
as
a
trespasser
across
their
lands.
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
is
clearly
erroneous
for
three
reasons:
first,
that
opinion
failed
to
defer
to
a
reasonable
administrative
interpretation
of
section
17
that
is
almost
compelled
by
the
statutory
language
found
in
that
section.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
clear
as
mountain
bell.
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
section
17
means
exactly
what
is
says.
the
united
states
amicus
brief,
i
think,
does
a
very
nice
job
of
explaining
the
particular
problems
with
that
theory.
the
tenth
circuit
stated
that
no
conveyance
of
pueblo
lands
would
be
valid
until
congress
hereinafter
provided
and
the
problem
with
that
analysis
is
that
the
first
clause
of
section
17
does
not
make
any
reference
to
conveyances
of
pueblo
lands,
only
the
second
clause
of
section
17
does.
and,
along
the
lines
justice
white
has
just
suggested,
the
tenth
circuit
reading
of
the
language
of
section
17
seems
superficial
at
best.
it
does
not
take
into
account
the
distinctly
different
types
of
language
used
in
the
first
and
second
clauses.
it
results
in
imputing
to
congress
a
most
bizarre
intention,
the
intention
of
enacting
a
statute
of
which
the
second
clause
was
totally
inoperative
at
the
time
it
was
passed.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
not
at
all,
your
honor.
section
16
of
the
act
is
an
integral
part
of
the
procedure
involving
the
pueblo
lands
act
and
how
that
procedure
was
going
to
be
administered
and
carried
out
through
the
fruition
of
the
process.
that
section--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--well--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--that
is
possible,
but
section
16
has
responsibilities
that
are
imposed
on
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
are
not
imposed
on
him
under
section
17.
under
section
16,
as
originally
drafted,
and
i
will
also
explain
the
amendment,
if
a
claimant
before
the
lands
board
was
not
successful
and
lost
his
property
so
that
this
piece
of
property
here
was
now
pueblo
property,
the
title
to
which
had
not
been
extinguished,
and
all
the
land
surrounding
that
property
were
in
non-indians,
then
the
secretary
was
supposed
to
put
that
piece
of
property
up
for
bid
to
the
highest
bidder
for
cash.
after
he
received
that
cash,
he
was
to--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--well,
they
couldn't
have
used
section
17
if
they
wanted
the
secretary
to
make
distinctions
between
the
claimant
who
bought
the
property
and
the
claimant
who
lost
the
property
and
they
couldn't
have
used
section
17
if
they
wanted
the
secretary
to
credit
when
it
was
the
claimant
who
bought
the
property
and
to
disburse
funds
for
improvements
when
it
was
the
claimant
who
didn't
purchase
it.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
used.
i
know
it
was
amended
in
1933
so
that
the
secretary
could
put
lands
out
for
bid,
still
within
the
confines
of
the
pueblo
lands
act
legislation
and
still
within
the
confines
of
the
adjudications
that
were
going
on
in
that
act,
so
that
the
land
no
longer
had
to
be
surrounded
by
non-indian
land.
and,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
specifically
amended,
i
guess
i
would
make
the
assumption
that
it
was
probably
used.
the
tenth
circuit's
interpretation,
as
i
mentioned,
ignored
a
reasonable
administrative
interpretation
of
section
17
that
was
almost
compelled
by
the
language
of
the
statute
and
it
gave
no
weight
to
the
administrative
practice
that
grew
up
around
that
interpretation,
a
practice
that
was
concurred
in
by
the
pueblos
themselves
and
by
their
legal
representatives.
in
so
doing
the
tenth
circuit
failed
to
follow
this
court's
admonition
in
a
long
line
of
cases
which
culminated
only
last
term
in
the
chevron
decision
delivered
by
justice
stevens
that
if
a
statute
is
ambiguous
or
is
silent,
that
a
court
should
not
substitute
its
interpretation
of
what
a
statute
means
over
and
above
that
of
an
administrative
agency
who
has
provided
that
statute
with
a
reasonable
administrative
interpretation.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
well,
it
depends
on
if
you
are
talking
about
in-court
documents
or
out-of-the
record
documents.
the
agency
stopped
using
section
17
which
is
not
at
all
surprising
because
in
1926
congress
enacted
legislation
that
would
have
allowed
utilities
to
go
ahead
and
condemn
pueblo
property
without
any
participation
or
consent
by
the
pueblo
and
without
any
participation
by
the
united
states
and,
indeed,
because
of
that
reason
a
district
court
in
new
mexico
ruled
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
therefore,
in
1908
and
1928
congress
adopted
legislation
that
the
general
right-of-way
statutes
that
applied
to
the
other
indian
tribes
in
the
united
states
would
also
be
applicable
to
the
pueblo.
at
that
point
in
time,
there
really
is
no
necessity
to
use
section
17,
although
it
does
seem
to
appear
from
the
record
that
the
secretary
used
section
17
whenever
a
pueblo
was
willing
to
consent
to
give
the
right-of-way
and
only
use
the
1928
act
initially
when
a
pueblo
refused
to
consent
to
give
a
right-of-way.
the
reason
i
said
that
about
inside
or
outside
of
the
record
is
i
understand
there
is
a
filing
by
the
pueblo
of
taos
which
attaches
the
department
of
interior
letter
to
the
solicitor
general
where
they
take
the
position
that
section
17
should
not
have
been
used.
and,
in
response
to
that,
i
would
only
say
that
the
amicus
brief
filed
before
this
court
is
filed
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
i
would
assume
the
decision
has
been
made
that
that
was
an
appropriate
administrative
practice.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
not
on
the
res
judicata
issue
we
don't
see
eye
to
eye.
we
generally
see
eye
to
eye,
i
think--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--the
construction
of
section
17.
i
think--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--i
think
the
united
states
indicates
that
this
court
could
limit
its
decision
if
it
so
chose.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
this
court...
mountain
bell's
position
would
be
that
it
could.
if
you
are
asking
me
what
the
logical
extension
is
of
mountain
bell's
argument,
i
will
readily
admit
that
the
logical
extension
of
that
argument
is
that
the
pueblo
is
authorized
to
sell,
grant,
lease,
or
convey
their
lands.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
well,
i
think
the
justification
is
we
reached
the
tenth
circuit
and,
indeed,
reached
this
court
was
because
that
is
what
the
record
was
based
on
and
that
is
what
the
administrative
practice
basically
involved.
at
the
time
this
interpretation
was
developed,
it
seems
quite
clear
from
reading
the
legislative
hearings
that
congress
simply
did
not
address
one
way
or
another
the
question
of
rights-of-way
when
it
was
discussing
the
pueblo
lands
act.
it
did
discuss,
however,
the
fact
that
the
pueblos
had,
since
this
court's
decision
in
joseph,
been
conveying...
making
conveyances
of
their
property
without
any
united
states
participation
or
approval.
it
was
also
informed
that
after
this
court's
decision
in
joseph
the
territorial
courts
of
new
mexico
had
held
that
the
pueblos
were
subject
to
the
new
mexico
state
statutes
of
limitations.
so,
there
were
two
evils
that
congress
was
informed
of.
they
were
informed
that
one
of
those
evils
was
being
remedied
at
the
time
the
hearings
on
this
act
were
held.
congress
was
informed
that
since
the
new
mexico
enabling
act
and
since
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
sandoval
that
pueblo
alienations,
conveyances,
and
leases
were
being
approved
by
the
department
and
that
is
how
the
exercise
of
guardianship
had
been
put
into
practice
in
new
mexico
regarding
pueblo
conveyancing.
the
pueblos
historically
had
the
power
to
convey
their
property
under
the
spanish
sovereignty
provided
that
it
was
approved
by
the
sovereign
and
there
is
support
for
that
proposition
into
the
mexico
jurisdiction
in
cases
of
this
court.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
indicate
that
congress
meant
to
deprive
the
pueblos
of
their
historical
power
to
convey
property.
the
only
thing
in
the
legislative
history
is
that
the
sovereign's
approval
was
being
exercised
since
this
court
indicated
in
sandoval
that
some
kind
of
guardianship
responsibility
or
relationship
was
involved
with
the
pueblo
indians
and
the
united
states.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
the
deposition
that
was
before
the
tenth
circuit
makes
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
was
one
out-right
conveyance
but
it
goes
into
no
detail
and
i
have
no
knowledge
about
the
surrounding
circumstances
from
the
record.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
i
think
the
united
states
would
like
the
administrative
practice
and
the
decision
of
this
court
to
be
limited.
i
think
this
court
can
limit
its
decision
if
it
wants,
but
i
don't
think
mountain
bell
feels
awkward
or
embarrassed
by
the
concept
that
the
logical
extension
of
its
argument
is
that
the
pueblos
could
convey
their
property
under
the
second
clause
of
section
17.
and,
if
this
court
would
want
to
so
hold,
it
would
certainly
go
far
to
articulate,
at
least
for
the
pueblos,
what
the
extent
of
their
power
is
under
that
statute.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
i
would
agree.
i
think
it
is
just
a
matter
of
if
this
court
wants
to
say
we
reserve
that
issue
for
another
day,
then
it
could
probably
do
that.
but,
i
think
you
are
right.
if
you
are
construing
the
language
of
the
statute,
as
long
as
you
don't
say
it
says
exactly
what
it
means,
mountain
bell
will
probably
be
comfortable.
i
would
like
to
read
the
second
clause
of
section
17.
it
is
that
section
on
which
mountain
bell
relies
to
support
the
validity
of
its
right-of-way.
it
states
that
"no
sale,
grant,
lease
of
any
character,
or
other
conveyance
of
lands,
or
any
title
or
claim
thereto,
made
by
any
pueblo
as
a
community,
or
any
individual
indian
living
in
a
pueblo
community
in
the
state
of
new
mexico,
shall
be
of
any
validity
in
law
or
in
equity
unless
the
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
"
there
are
two
things
that
are
fairly
obvious
about
that
language.
the
first
is
that
it
is
directed
to
conduct
that
originates
with
the
pueblo.
the
pueblo
is
the
acting
body.
they
make
a
conveyance
or
the
individual
indian
is
an
active
conveyor,
the
body
that
does
the
action.
the
section
then
is
clearly
talking
about
consensual
and
voluntary
activity.
the
second
thing
that
is
fairly
obvious
about
the
language
is
that
it
is
language
substantially
similar
to
the
non-intercourse
act
of
1834
that
was
on
the
books
at
the
time
the
pueblo
lands
act
was
passed
in
1924.
that
statute
as
written
was
by
1924
an
anachronism.
it
still
read
that
a
treaty
or
a
convention
was
required,
but
in
1871
congress
had
stated
that
no
more
treatying
should
be
done
with
the
indians.
therefore,
the
second
clause
of
section
17
substitutes
for
something
that
was
already
anachronistic,
a
requirement
of
secretarial
approval
to
validate
the
indian
conveyance.
and,
as
i
have
explained,
the
approval
of
the
department
of
interior
was
the
way
that
the
united
states
had
been
exerting
its
guardianship
at
the
time
the
pueblo
lands
act
hearings
were
taking
place.
the
secretarial
approval
requirement,
as
i
said,
took
the
place
of
the
treaty
or
convention
requirement
and
to
the
extent
that
the
people
involved
in
the
transaction
complied
with
the
restriction,
the
conveyance
that
was
attendant
to
that
statute
was
valid
in
the
same
way
that
a
conveyance
made
within
the
confines
of
a
treaty
or
a
convention
was
clearly
valid
under
the
non-intercourse
act
of
1834.
the
first
clause
of
section
17,
on
the
other
hand,
is
written
in
language
distinctly
different
from
the
second
clause.
"no
right,
title,
or
interest
in
or
to
the
lands
of
the
pueblos
to
which
their
title
has
not
been
extinguished
as
hereinbefore
determined
shall
hereafter
be
acquired
or
initiated
by
virtue
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
or
in
any
other
manner
except
as
may
hereafter
be
provided
by
congress.
"
that
language
uses
language
characteristic
of
an
involuntary
transaction,
something
that
is
done
against
the
pueblo
as
opposed
to
done
with
their
concurrence
on
their
origination.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
it
doesn't
speak
of
transfers
in
any
other
manner,
it
says
or
in
any
other
manner,
no
right,
title,
or
interest
or
in
any
other
manner.
what
the
department
of
interior
did--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--it
suggests
something
broader
than
involuntary
alienations
under
laws
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
and,
if
you
applied
the
general
ejusdem
generis
principles
you
have
got
a
broader
clause
that
is
followed
by
limited
involuntary
types
of
language
and
the
most
that
"or
in
any
other
manner"
would
then
refer
to
would
be
to
some
other
types
of
involuntary
losses
that
arose
other
than
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
and,
indeed,
the
department
of
interior--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--well,
it
is
the
interpretation
of
the
department
and
it
is
also
an
interpretation
that
arises
out
of
a
generally
well-recognized
statutory
construction
canon
and
that
is
that
a
general
phrase
is
limited--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--right.
along
those
lines
i
might
just
say
that
the
department
of
the
interior
did
find
a
meaning
for
that
language.
indeed,
it
prohibited
the
railroad
from
acquiring
a
right-of-way
under
an
1899
statute
or
mountain
bell
from
acquiring
a
right-of-way
from
the
secretary
under
the
1901
statute.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
under
section
16,
justice
brennan,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
some
very
clearly
stated
administrative
responsibilities
with
money.
he
is
to
sell
the
property
with
the
consent
of
the
pueblo.
if
they
claimant
who
had
made
the
claim
before
the
board
is
the
loser,
meaning
he
doesn't
buy
the
property,
then
the
secretary
is
required
to
take
the
money,
give
some
of
it
to
the
indian
tribe
and
give
the
rest
of
it
to
the
claimant
who
had
made
improvements
on
the
property.
if
the
claimant
is
the
purchaser
under
section
16,
the
secretary
is
to
credit
what
he
gives
to
the
pueblos
the
benefit
and
value
of
the
improvements
that
were
made
by
the
non-winning
claimant.
so,
he
has
some
clearly
defined
administrative
responsibilities
that
are
integral
to
the
entire
pueblo
lands
act
resolution
that
are
not
addressed
in
section
17.
section
17--
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
--it
does
not
address
what
type
of
form
they
should
and
the
secretary
is
the
seller
under
section
16,
not
the
pueblo.
the
pueblo
is
a
consenting
body
to
the
sale
under
section
16.
i
think
the
briefs
also
make
clear,
i
am
sure
this
court
is
aware,
they
were
put
into
the
statute
at
different
times.
section
16,
however,
is
integral
to
that
statute,
whereas
17
is
prospectively
addressed
to
deal
with
transactions
that
occur
outside
of
the
pueblo
lands
act.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
ms.
kathryn
marie
krause
thank
you.
the
non-intercourse
act
or
the
section
17
is
basically
an
adoption
of
the
non-intercourse
act
and
shows
that
the
second
clause
of
section
17
uses
the
language
of
the
non-intercourse
act
that
was
on
the
books.
the
first
clause
of
section
17
in
essence
is
the
first
legislative
statement
of
what
had
been
held
to
be
judicially
the
necessary
implications
of
the
non-intercourse
act.
if
a
conveyance
was
made
within
the
confines
of
a
treaty
or
a
convention,
it
was
valid,
and
if
a
transfer
of
land
occurred
in
any
other
way
voluntarily
or
involuntarily,
it
was
invalid.
the
courts
have
held
you
couldn't
involuntarily
transfer
the
land
through
statutes
of
limitations,
through
deeds
that
didn't
comport
with
the
requirements
of
a
treaty
or
a
convention
or
any
other
theory
and
that
is
basically
what
the
first
clause
of
section
17
does.
the
argument
that
the
pueblos
are
in
a
status
all
by
themselves
is
refuted
at
page
20
of
mountain
bell's
opening
brief
and
page
six
of
its
reply
brief.
the
chickasaw
and
the
cherokee
tribes
have
been
authorized
to
convey
their
property
with
the
participation
of
their
tribal
agents
or
their
counsels
and
with
the
approval
of
either
the
president
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
this
is
not
an
unparalleled
kind
of
power.
it
is
not
an
usual
power
for
congress
to
grant,
but
the
legislative
hearings
make
quite
clear
that
the
pueblo
indians,
even
in
1924,
were
not
considered
to
be
usual
indians.
they
were
respected
in
their
mexican
community.
there
is
considerable
debate
in
those
hearing
as
to
whether
they
are
indeed
citizens
of
new
mexico
even
though
the
sandoval
court
did
not
decide.
there
is
considerable
discussion
in
those
legislative
histories
about
conveyances
that
were
made
by
individual
pueblo
indians,
discussions
about
how
the
pueblo
tribe
had
conveyed
to
an
individual
indian
who
had
turned
around
and
conveyed
to
a
non-indian.
therefore,
the
language
of
section
17
in
almost
every
phrase
and
every
clause
has
a
distinct
reference
in
the
history
as
congress
knew
it
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
on
the
grounds
that
section
17
does
not
mean
exactly
what
the
tenth
circuit
said
it
meant.
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention.
