ms.
krause,
i
guess
your
interpretation
really
makes
section
16
of
the
act
superfluous,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then
i
suppose
if
17
means
what
you
say
it
means,
then
section
16
was
not
needed--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--because
the
pueblo,
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary,
could
have
disposed
of
lands
that
otherwise
would
have
been
disposed
of
under
section
16
possibly.
justice
o'connor
well,
wait.
i
think
we
understand,
but
if
17
means
what
you
say
it
means,
that
wouldn't
have
to
be
done
at
all.
they
could
have
used
section
17
and,
indeed,
i
guess
there
are
some
indications
that
17
was
used
instead
of
16.
justice
o'connor
do
you
know
whether
section
16
was
ever
used?
justice
o'connor
the
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
think
section
17
is
limited
to
just
conveyances
of
right-of-way?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
borg,
have
the
indians,
the
pueblos
ever
asked
congress
to
amend
section
17
to
clarify
the
section
in
all
these
years
where
the
secretary
of
interior
had
a
different
interpretation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
no
suggestion
has
ever
been
made
to
congress
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
section
16
ever
been
utilized
t
your
knowledge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
often?
