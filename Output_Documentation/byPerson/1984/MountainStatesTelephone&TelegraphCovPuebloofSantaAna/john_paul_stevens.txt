justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
your
earlier
suit,
may
i
just
ask
this
question
about
it?
do
you
contend
that
that
suit
adjudicated
the
right
of
mountain
bell
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed
or
at
the
time
the
suit
was
dismissed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
claim
that
was
an
adjudication
that
mountain
bell
had
previously
acquired
the
right-of-way
or
that
it
was
an
adjudication
that
the
conveyance
that
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
interior
was
a
valid
conveyance?
what
did
they
decide?
you
rely
on
res
judicata.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
it
that
you
say
they
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
are
saying
that
that
adjudication
was
to
the
effect
that
mountain
bell
had
good
titles
before
the
lawsuit
was
filed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
that.
i
am
just
trying
to
understand
what
your
theory
is
of
what
it
was
that
the
court
adjudicated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
still
not
sure
i
understand
your
position.
you
say
then
that
it
was
an
adjudication
that
the
1928
conveyance
was
a
valid
conveyance
or
an
adjudication
that
they
previously
had
good
title?
i
just
don't
know
what
you
are
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
say
that
it
means
as
of
the
date
of
the
entry
of
the
order
they
owned
the
property.
i
am
just
trying
to
figure
out
on
which
of
two
alternative
theories
do
you
think
that
the
judgment
rests?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
try
and
rephrase
it.
there
are
two
theories
on
which
you
could
have
acquire
title
at
the
date
that
order
was
entered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
was
that
you
got
it
back
in
1905
or
whatever
the
date
of
your
original
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
theory
was
that
after
the
lawsuit
was
filed
the
secretary
approved
the
conveyance
to
you.
one
of
those
two
theories
must
support
the
order.
i
am
asking
you
which
do
you
think
supports
the
order.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
are
saying
that
this
was
an
adjudication
not
of
any
issue
tendered
by
the
complaint,
rather
of
the
validity
of
the
post-complaint
conveyance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
i
understand
you
to
be
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
stevens
ms.
krause,
can
i
go
back
for
a
second
before
i
lose
the
thought
to
the
question
of
limiting
the
case
to
rights-of-way.
your
argument,
i
gather,
is
that
because
that
is
where
the
main
administrative
practice
was,
why,
maybe
that
is
all
you
have
to
do.
but,
isn't
it
true,
i
think,
there
were
64
conveyances
of
right-of-ways
and
one
conveyance
of
land,
all
of
which
were
approved
by
the
secretary?
justice
stevens
i
see.
i
was
thinking
if
it
were
true,
even
if
it
was
only
one,
and
the
secretary
followed
the
same
practice
there,
i
don't
know
why
the
argument
wouldn't...
how
you
can
chop
it
off.
justice
stevens
it
isn't
really
what
we
want
to
hold.
we
are
construing
a
statute
and
it
seems
hard
for
me
to
believe
it
means
one
thing
with
one
kind
of
a
conveyance
and
another
thing
with
another
kind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
borg,
you
say
the
secretary
has
never
been
given
this
authority.
didn't
he
get
this
authority
in
section
16?
there
is
no
requirement
of
congressional
approvement
in
section
16.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
that
is
a
carte
blanche
congressional
approval,
not
as
to
each
particular
act
or
anything
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
consent
conditioned
on
the
approval
of
the
leaders
of
the
tribe
and
also--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
secretary
are
the
same
condition
in
section
17.
justice
stevens
the
difference
is,
i
suppose,
that
in
section
16
you
are
dealing
with
conveyances
conceivably
of
an
individual
member
of
the
pueblo
who
might
not
want
himself
to
dispose
of
his
land.
justice
stevens
why
does
the
statute
then
refer
to
any
pueblo
indian
living
in
a
community?
it
seems
to
contemplate
individual
ownership
of
some
of
the
land.
that
is
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
factual
question
before
you
move
on.
these
64
conveyances
that
took
place,
what
period
of
time
do
they
cover?
is
that
in
the
papers--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
were
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
was
drafted
by
the
lawyer
for
the
pueblo.
wasn't
it
mr.
wilson
that
wrote
this
section?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i
misspoke.
wasn't
it
correct
though
that
mr.
wilson
was
basically
kind
of
representing
the
interests
of
the
people
you
now
represent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know,
one
thing
that
i
guess
that
has
run
through
my
mind
a
couple
of
times
when
you
mentioned
the
importance
of
the
case
to
the
pueblo,
because
it
treats
them
differently
than
other
indian
tribes,
in
a
way
it
treats
them
with
a
higher
degree
of
respect
if
it
gives
them
greater
autonomy
in
their
right
to
dispose
of
their
land.
