justice
jr.
yes,
but
the
section
does
speak
of
transfers
in
any
other
manner,
doesn't
it?
justice
jr.
doesn't
that
suggest
something
other
than
just
involuntary
transfer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
do
you
get
the
source
of
that
interpretation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
used
in
generous.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
i
have
you
interpreted,
i
think
you
may
have
already
answered
this
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
but
giving
17
the
interpretation
that
permits
voluntary
sale
on
the
secretary's
approval,
what
point
is
under
section
16?
justice
jr.
is
that
to
say
that
16
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
form
that
the
conveyances
should
take?
justice
jr.
but
ever
since
1924
have
most
or
all
of
these
been
transfers
only
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary?
justice
jr.
that
is
all?
justice
jr.
any
suggestion
that
there
be
consent
of
congress
before
this
date?
