--but
those
two
kinds
of
authorizations
are
quite
different.
the
first
would
be
that
an
individual
pueblo
isn't
authorized
to
convey
land
to
which
he
has
no
title
and
if
congress
ultimately
allots
lands,
then
the
individual
pueblo
would
have
the
sort
of
title
he
could
convey.
but,
that
is
quite
a
different
kind
of
authorization
from
the
second
kind
of
authorization
you
spoke
of.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
kerr-mcgee
case
that
is
going
to
be
argued
to
us
next
week,
the
government...
the
indian
tribes
take
the
position
that
the
last
thing
the
tribes
should
want
is
secretarial
approval.
they
ought
to
be
able
to
do
things
on
their
own.
now,
each
tribe
is
presumably
entitled
to
its
own
view
on
that
thing,
but
certainly
a
lot
of
people,
i
think,
would
agree
with
the
suggestion
of
justice
stevens.
justice
rehnquist
the
indians
don't
want
their
own
governing
bodies
to
be
able
to
convey
land
without
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior?
