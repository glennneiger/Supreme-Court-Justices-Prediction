mr.
come?
justice
rehnquist
has
the
board
ever
explained
the
relationship
between
section
152(3)
of
the
act,
where
congress
says
that
the
term
159(b)
to
decide
that
close
relatives
shan't
be
members
of
a
bargaining
unit?
i
would
think
there
is
an
argument
there
that
congress
has
already
spoken
to
this
subject
and
it
has
not
gone
as
far
as
the
board
has.
justice
rehnquist
--well,
did
the
union...
did
the
board
apply
a
test
using
the
factor
you
have
just
described
in
this
particular
case?
justice
rehnquist
i
didn't
understand
mr.
come
to
defend
a
test
which
would
have
incorporated
as
one
factor
how
much
union
activity
the
particular
person
had
engaged
in.
justice
rehnquist
yes.
