mr.
stewart
j.
katz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
reality,
what
the
board
seeks
to
do
here
is
they
are
seeking
authority
to
disenfranchise
and
exclude
from
a
bargaining
unit
individuals
who
fall
within
the
definition
of
an
employee
under
the
act.
in
this
case,
that
is
relatives
of
owner-managers
of
a
closely
held
corporation.
they
seek
to
exclude
and
to
disenfranchise
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
that
employee
terms
and
conditions
are
at
the
job
place.
that
is
conceded
by
the
board.
and
there
was
a
specific
finding
in
this
case
throughout
and
at
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
is
no
special
job
status
or
job
privileges
that
diane
and
mildred
sabo
enjoyed
as
a
result
of
their
family
relationship.
the
board
is
seeking
reversal
of
the
sixth
circuit's
finding--
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
i'm
sorry,
i
stand
corrected.
as
to
diane
sabo,
two
of
the
three
panel
members
did
find
special
status.
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
hearing
officer
found
no
special
status
as
to
both
employees.
i
stand
corrected.
the
board
is
seeking
reversal
of
the
sixth
circuit
standard
which
in
effect
does
not
believe
that
employees
should
be
disenfranchised
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
pedigree.
we
urge
adoption
of
the
sixth
circuit
standard.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
standard
is
clear.
it
effectuates
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
congressional
intent.
now,
in
its
statements
to
you,
the
board
indicated
that
it
has
a
longstanding
policy
of
exclusion
of
relatives
based
on
family
ties.
that
we
tend
to
differ
upon.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
1953,
throughout,
the
board
has
applied
a
special
status
test.
from
1953
to
1967,
they
consistently
applied
the
test.
from
1967,
when
they
passed
their
decision
in
foam
rubber,
they
indicated
that
they
were
now
going
to
go
back
to
a
family
tie
only
test.
however,
as
the
courts
indicated
in
reviewed
decisions
of
the
board,
that
was
not
the
case.
the
board
continued
to
use
at
various
times
special
status.
i
think
the
caravelle
court
even
said
that.
subsequent
to
that
and
the
supposed
adoption
of
the
adoption
of
caravelle,
the
board
continue
at
times
to
use
special
status
cases,
and
linn
gear,
a
ninth
circuit
case,
commented
on
that
particular
point,
so
that
since
1953...
and
linn
gear
was
decided,
i
believe,
in
1979...
the
board
has
applied
in
various
degrees
a
special
status
test.
the
sixth
circuit
test
which
relies
not
to
exclude
solely
on
the
basis
of
family
ties
but
is
a
test
in
which
family
ties
can
be
used
to
demonstrate
special
status
if
there
are
special
job
privileges
and
benefits
that
flow
to
the
employee
as
a
basis
of
that
family
relationship,
is
a
neutral
test.
it
takes...
it
respects
all
sides
because
it
is
related
to
the
job
place.
the
board,
through
what
it
indicates,
an
adoption
of
caravelle,
which
i
am
going
to
comment
because
that
is
not
the
entire
board
theory,
but
in
terms
of
caravelle,
adopts
what
is...
what
is
called
an
expanded
community
of
interest
test.
it
looks
to
things
that
have
no
impact
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
terms
and
conditions
as
they
relate
to
the
job
place
itself.
the
sixth
circuit
test
refuses
to
do
that
and
remains
neutral
which
is
exactly
what
savair
calls
for,
as
this
court
indicated.
the
sixth
circuit
test
does
not
look
to
loyalty
or
divided
loyalty.
it
does
not
look
to
how
an
employee
may
or
may
not
vote.
it
does
not
look
to
how
an
employee...
whether
the
employee
has
engaged
in
any
union
activity,
which
is
exactly
one
of
the
factors
the
board
looks
to.
the
board
in
1972
and
1974
adopted
caravelle
standards.
they
haven't
applied
them
uniformly
since,
but
nevertheless,
they
indicated
that
that's
what
they
were
adopting.
however,
and
as
the
board
points
out
in
their
brief,
in
a
footnote,
they
also
adopted
linn
gear,
which
was
then
also
adopted
by
pattison
of
the
eight...
case
in
the
eighth
circuit.
linn
gear,
one
of
the
factors
in
linn
gear
is
you
are
supposed
to
explore
and
look
at
what
union
activity,
if
any,
the
relative
has
engaged
in.
now,
that,
it
seems
to
me,
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
not
only
savair,
but
the
congressional
amendments
of
1947
which
talk
about,
in
section
7,
the
employee
has
the
absolute
right
to
engage
in
union
activity,
collective
bargaining,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
but
also
has
the
absolute
right
to
refrain
therefrom.
in
addition,
9(b)
in
1947
was
changed
to
grant
to
all
employees
their
fullest
freedoms
as
it
relates
to
all
sections
of
the
act.
and
again,
9(b)
flows
from
section
7.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
section
7,
if
it
could
be
characterized
as
such,
is
the
guts
of
this
act,
and
that
is
to
protect
the
rights
of
employees,
whether
or
not
they
are
engaged
in...
or
are
pro-union
or
anti-union.
so
when
the
question
was
asked
previously
as
to
whether
or
not
union
animus
might
be
considered,
in
linn
gear
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
is
put
down.
what
activity,
if
any,
has
this
employee
engaged
in
vis-a-vis
the
union?
now,
that
really
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
an
employee
has
a
right
to
vote.
in
other
words,
if
a
union
is
going
to
present
evidence,
or
someone
presents
evidence
that
an
employee
passed
cards
out
and
happens
to
be
the
sister
of
the
owner,
well,
am
i
to
assume
that
because
that
individual
passed
cards
that
she
could
now
vote,
or
if
that
employee
did
not
pass
cards
out
or
sign
the
cards,
that
employee
cannot
vote?
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
the
board
did
not
cite
any
case.
it
doesn't
cite...
as
i
recall
the
board
decision,
it
is
in
a
footnote,
okay?
the
board
itself,
the
hearing
officer
did
not
cite
caravelle,
okay?
the
hearing
officer
did
not
cite
linn
gear,
as
i
recall
his
decision.
the
board
did
not
cite
any
case
in
footnote
2,
which
was
their
decision
in
this
case.
the
sixth
circuit,
in
this
case
prior
to
coming
up
here,
indicated
in
its
footnote
that
it
rejects
the
expanded
community
of
interest
test
that
some
other
circuits
have
applied.
i
don't
recall
offhand
whether
or
not
they
cited
linn
gear
along
with
caravelle.
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
i'm...
i
don't...
i
think
he
indicated
that...
i
think
the
question
was
asked
by
justice
o'connor,
well,
could
you
consider
antiunion
animus?
and
he
said
no,
the
board
was
neutral--
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
--on
savair,
and
he
cited
savair,
that
based
upon
its
neutrality,
that
would
not
be
permissible,
and
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
is
that...
and
the
board
concedes
in
its
brief
to
this
court...
that
caravelle
isn't
the
test.
caravelle
plus
linn
gear
is
the
test
the
board
relies
on
because
the
board
has
adopted
linn
gear
and
indicates
so
in
its
brief.
and
one
of
the
linn
gear
factors
is
what
activity,
if
any,
has
that
employee
engaged
in?
now,
additionally,
the
sixth
circuit
case
protects
all
rights
under
savair.
it
is
a
test
that
has
been
uniformly
applied
by
the
sixth
circuit
for
30
years,
since
1953,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
in
sexton
in
1953
which
triggered
board
re-evaluation
or
evaluation
of
its
position
when
in
1953
they
then
decided
to
follow
the
sixth
circuit
lead
when
it
decided
international
metal.
as
indicated
previously,
the
board,
although
it
indicates
in
1967
it
switched
back
to
a
family
only
tie,
based
upon
foam
rubber
city,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
in
all
the
courts
that
have
reviewed
board
conduct
since
then
have
indicated
that
it
has
engaged
in
at
best
a
checkered
course,
and
even
since
foam
rubber
and
even
since
caravelle,
has
at
various
times
applies
a
special
status
test
as
to
relatives.
i'm
not
talking
about
only
managers,
relatives
of
a
manger,
i'm
talking
about
relatives
of
owners,
and
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief
to
this
court.
basically
i
understand
the
board
has
broad
authority
as
it
relates
to
unit
determinations,
but
they
do
not
have
the
unlimited
discretion
to
interpret
statutory
language
in
a
manner
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
act.
2(3)
specifically
designates
what
an
employee
is,
and
it
indicates
what
relatives
are
to
be
out
on
a
per
se
basis.
that's
the
test.
all
the
courts,
including
caravelle,
in
caravelle
1,
i
believe,
indicated
that
what...
that
the
board's
intent
through
9(b)
was
in
effect
a
modification,
an
impermissible
modification
of
section
2.3.
all
courts
have
said
that,
even
caravelle
1.
i
think
caravelle
1
made
the
comment,
we
cannot
allow
you
to
accomplish
something
under
one
provision
that
you
cannot
accomplish
under
the
other.
caravelle
then
went
on,
for
whatever
reason,
to
draft
an
expanded
community
of
interest
test
which
allowed
the
board
or
gave
the
board
some
guideline
as
to
whether
or
not
they
wanted
to
follow
factors
that
again
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
ability
or
their
factors
on
the
job.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
board,
the
court
in
caravelle
2,
i
believe,
specifically
indicated
that
the
factors
they
set
up
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
employee
at
the
job.
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
yes,
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
no,
no.
i
think
that...
the
sixth
circuit
has
indicated
that,
properly
used,
9(b)
will
determine
community
of
interest,
but
i
believe
what
the
sixth
circuit
is
saying
is
that
you
are
going
to
do
that
by
looking
at
what
that
person
does
at
the
job.
if
that
person
has
the
same
terms
and
conditions
of
employee,
make
the
same
amount
of
money,
reports
to
the
same
job
location,
is
subject
to
the
same
work
rules,
is
under
the
same
supervision,
then
we
will
take
into
account
the
fact
that
there's
a
family
tie,
but
we
are
not
going
to
exclude
solely
on
that
family
tie.
we
are
not
going
to
exclude
an
employee
from
a
bargaining
unit
simply
because
of
this
family
relationship.
don't
forget,
the
employee
cannot
vote.
the
employee
is
also
excluded
from
the
bargaining
unit.
the
employee,
however,
is
still
an
employee
under
the
act,
now,
which
raises
an
interesting
sort
of
a
situation
because
unlike
the
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court
with
the
confidential
employee
in
hendricks
or
in
bell
aerospace
when
we
are
talking
about
managerial
employees,
in
those
cases,
not
only
was
the
employee
out
of
the
unit,
regardless
of
whether
they
still
remained
an
employee
under
the
act,
but
the
work
they
did
left
the
unit.
in
other
words,
it
was
the
work,
the
work
that
triggered
the
exclusion.
in
this
particular
case,
the
work
remains
in
the
unit.
that
employee
is
a
ledger
clerk.
mildred
sabo
is
a
register,
a
cashier.
that
work
is
bargaining
unit
work.
that
is
what
the
union
has
been
certified
to
represent.
now
we
are
faced
with
a
practical
situation
of
here
is
an
employee
that
can't
vote,
is
not
supposedly
in
the
unit,
but
her
work
is
in
the
unit.
now,
is
that
person
supposed
to
be...
are
we
supposed
to
create
a
job
for
that
person?
are
we
supposed
to
terminate
that
person?
are
we...
now,
whether
or
not
a
non-unit
employee,
which
mildred
sabo
in
this
case
would
be,
is
able
to
perform
bargaining
unit
work
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining.
we
cannot
take
that
work
and
move
it
out
of
the
bargaining
unit
on
our
own
unilaterally.
that
means
we
have
got
to
sit
down
at
the
table
with
the
union,
assuming
the
union
wins,
and
we
have
got
to
bargain
that
out.
if
the
union
says
no,
i
am
faced
as
a
practical
matter
with
either
firing
mildred
sabo
or
taking
a
strike.
now,
here
is
an
employee
that
did
nothing,
has
gotten
no
special
privileges
in
eleven
years
of
work,
and
all
of
a
sudden
her
job
is
in
jeopardy,
and
she
never
had
the
right
to
vote
about
it
either.
i
think
that's
wrong,
and
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
is
saying
that
is
exactly
what
is
wrong.
now,
if
somebody
is
getting
special
privileges
on
the
job
and
there
is
this
great
differentiation,
then,
yeah,
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that,
and
the
sixth
circuit
doesn't
have
any
problem
with
it.
and
i
might
indicate
as
a--
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
--well,
at
that
particular
point
in
time--
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
--no,
but
there's
a
differentiation,
just
like
i
think
in
this
court
there
was
a
differentiation
with
confidential
employees
in
that
not
all
confidential
employees
were
excluded
from
the
unit.
what
you
have
got
here
is...
and
i
see
a
distinction
and
a
difference
between
an
employee...
if
the
employer
grants
special
privileges
because
of
that
relationship
and
the
employee
accepts
those
special
privileges
because
of
the
relationship,
then
wherever
the
ships
fall,
the
chips
fall.
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
yes,
it
would,
but
now,
but
you
see,
the
point
i
am
making
in
response
to
that--
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
--that
would
be
true
in
that
regard,
but
what
i
am
coming
to,
though,
is
that
what
we
are
looking
for
really
is
a...
not
a
large
grouping
of
employees
that
are
under
review
here.
no
family
starts
a
family
run
business
and
says
to
itself,
well,
look,
i
am
going
to
make
sure
that
i
don't
grant
any
special
privileges
to
my
niece,
nephew,
sister,
because
eleven
years
from
now
or
ten
years
from
now
i
am
going
to
get
a
union
petition.
generally
what
happens
is
the
family
business
is
run,
and
it
is
quite
easy
to
show
special
status.
in
virtually,
in
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
the
parties
stipulate
that
these
people
are
ineligible
to
vote
because
it
is
glaringly
obvious
that
there
are
special
privileges.
it
is
only
those
unique
situations
where
you
have
in
this
particular
case
two
eleven
year
employees
who
have
no
special
status,
and
that's
what
this
whole
thing
is
coming
down
to,
a
grouping
of
employees
that
are
causing--
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
--no,
she...
in
this
particular
case
she
maintains
the
house,
she
has
certain
financial
responsibilities
relative
to
that
house.
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
--well,
none.
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
none.
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
as
it
relates
to
the
job.
mr.
stewart
j.
katz
in
that
regard,
yes.
in
conclusion,
i
believe
that
the
sixth
circuit
test
is
the
fair
test.
i
think
what
the
board
has
done
in
terms
of
seeking
to
reverse,
or
in
its
position,
is
in
effect
to
amend
the
act,
amend
2(3).
it
is...
its
conduct
is
not
in
furtherance
of
congressional
intent
but
is
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent
of
the
'47
amendments
which
made
specific
changes
in
section
7
and
section
9(b)
to
assure
all
employees
the
fullest
rights
under
