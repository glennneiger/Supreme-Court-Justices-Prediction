but
mr.
come,
the
board
is
relying
on
section
9(b)
authority,
and
9(b)
speaks
in
terms
of
selection
of
an
employer
unit,
a
craft
unit,
a
plant
unit,
or
a
subdivision,
and
it
just
doesn't
address
itself
to
picking
out
individuals,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
the
board's
position
that
it
could
employ
a
standard
that
would
exclude
individuals
simply
based
on
anti-union
animus
alone?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not,
under
the
board's
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
a
close
friend
of
someone
in
management?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
come,
is
the
board
asking
just
for
a
rule
for
relatives
and
no
one
else,
just
a
bright
line
rule
for
relatives?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
board
asking
for,
though,
and
what's
the
board's
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
application
of
a
special
job-related
privileges
or
benefits
test
such
as
that
approved
by
the
sixth
circuit,
could
exclude
individuals
from
a
bargaining
unit
who
are
not
excludable
under
section
2.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
are
not
arguing
that
that's
improper,
are
you?
