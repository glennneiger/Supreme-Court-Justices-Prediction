mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
authority
under
section
9(b)
of
the
act
which
gives
the
board
broad
discretion
in
regard
to
establishing
units
appropriate
for
collective
bargaining,
to
exclude
from
a
bargaining
unit
employees
who
are
close
relatives
of
the
owners
of
a
closely
held
corporation
that
employs
them
without
a
showing
that
the
employee
relatives
receive
special
job-related
privilege.
the
basic
facts
are
these.
respondent
is
an
automobile
parts
and
gasoline
dealer
in
michigan.
the
dealership,
a
closely
held
corporation,
is
owned
equally
by
three
brothers,
richard,
robert
and
james
sabo,
who
are
president,
vice
president,
and
secretary-treasurer
respectively.
the
three
sabo
brothers
are
actively
involved
in
respondent's
daily
operations;
together
they
make
all
of
its
policy
decisions
and
retain
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
supervision
of
all
of
its
partners.
in
march
of
1981
the
retail
employees
union
filed
a
petition
with
the
board
requesting
that
a
representation
election
be
held
among
respondent's
employees.
respondent
from
the
union
stipulated
to
an
election
in
two
bargaining
units,
a
unit
of
store
and
warehouse
employees
at
respondent's
nine
retail
stores,
and
a
unit
of
office
clerical
employees
at
respondent's
headquarters
office.
the
union
received
a
plurality
of
the
votes
in
the
election,
but
the
validity
of
its
certification
as
the
bargaining
representative
for
both
of
these
units
turns
on
the
validity
of
the
board's
action
in
sustaining
the
challenges
to
the
ballots
of
diane
and
mildred
sabo.
diane
is
the
wife
of
respondent's
president
richard
sabo.
she
is
a
regular
part
time
general
ledger
clerk
at
the
headquarters
office.
she
resides
with
her
husband,
and
both
work
at
the
same
office.
at
work
she
often
goes
to
lunch
with
her
husband,
or
one
or
both
of
his
brothers.
mildred
sabo,
the
mother
of
the
three
sabo
brothers
who
own
and
operate
respondent,
is
a
full
time
cashier
at
one
of
the
retail
stores.
she
lives
with
secretary-treasurer
james
sabo
in
a
house
that
he
owns,
and
she
sees
or
has
contact
with
her
other
sons
and
their
families
on
a
regular
basis.
the
board,
applying
its
longstanding
policy
of
excluding
close
relatives
of
the
owners
of
a
closely
held
corporation
from
bargaining
units
where
the
family
relationship
is
such
as
to
remove
the
employee
relative
from
the
community
of
interests
shared
with
other
employees,
concluded
that
diane
and
mildred
sabo
should
be
excluded
from
the
bargaining
unit
because
in
view
of
their
relationship
to
respondent's
owners,
their
interests
were
more
closely
allied
with
management
than
with
the
other
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
sixth
circuit
refused
to
enforced
the
board's
order.
it
felt
constrained
by
section
2(3)
of
the
statute
which
excludes
from
the
definition
of
employee
any
individual
employed
by
his
parent
or
spouse,
which...
it
is
the
board's
position
that
this
provision
which
goes
back
to
the
wagner
act
days
simply
defined
the
relatives
of
employers
of...
who
are
wholly
outside
of
the
act's
protection.
it
says
nothing
about
how
the
board
should
exercise
its
discretion
in
determining
appropriate
units
with
respect
to
relatives
who
are
employees
within
the
act's
coverage.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
does
not.
however,
the
board
from
its
earliest
days,
in
defining
units
under
section
9(b),
has
used
a
community
of
interest
standard.
the
purpose
in
defining
the
unit
under
that
standard
is
to
put
together
groupings
of
employees
that
have
a
unity
of
economic
interests
and
try
to
exclude
employees
that
do
not
share.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor,
that
is--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--because,
the
statute
certainly,
since
the
taft-hartley
amendments,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
savair,
is,
mandates
neutrality
with
respect
to
whether
employees
wish
to
select
a
union
or
not
wish
to
select
a
union.
so
that
would
not
be
a
permissible
criterion.
however,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
the
basis
for
the
board's
exclusion
of
close
relatives
from
units
does
not
turn
on
that
factor.
that
may
be
a
consequence
of
the
exclusion,
but
that
is
not
the
basis
for
the
exclusion.
one
might
argue,
for
example,
that
if
you
were
to
exclude
an
employee
who
is
highly
skilled
and
makes
substantially
more
an
hour
from
a
unit
with
relatively
low
paid
employees
on
the
ground
that
they
do
not
share
the
same
unity
of
economic
interest,
it
may
be
likely
that
this
high
skilled
employee
might
be
less
disposed
to
vote
for
the
union
than
would
be
the
rank
and
file.
but
that
is
not
the
basis
for
the
exclusion.
the
basis
is
whether
they
share
an
economic,
a
community
of
interest.
now,
the
board
from
its
earliest
days
has
excluded
close
relatives
that
do
not
fit
the
2(3)
definition
from
bargaining
units.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
that
might
not
be
sufficient
because
the
board
over
the
years
has
refined
its
1
unit
exclusion
policy
and
has
adopted
the
factors
that
were
articulated
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
caravelle
case,
and
in
looking
at
those
factors,
what
the
board
looks
at
is
how
high
a
percentage
of
the
stock
a
parent
or
spouse
owns,
how
many
of
the
shareholders
are
related
to
one
another,
whether
the
shareholder
is
actively
engaged
in
management
or
holds
a
supervisory
position,
how
many
relatives
are
employed
as
compared
with
the
total
number
of
employees,
and
whether
the
relative
lives
in
the
same
household
or
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it's
a
bright
line
rule
for
some
relatives.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think,
i
think,
i
think
that
that
is
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board,
the
board's
position
is
that
it
is
a
reasonable
and
permissible
interpretation
of
its
role
under
the
statute
to
be
empowered
to
find
that
relatives
who
would
meet
the
caravelle
criteria,
that
what
we
are
talking
about
essentially
is
close
relatives
of
owners
of
closely
held
companies,
because
the
way
it
is
worked
out
is
that
unless
you
have
had
that
situation,
the
board
has
not
found
that
a
lack
of
community
interest
based
solely
on
the
family
relationship
but
has
required
a
showing
of
a
special
job
state,
so
that
in
your
example
of
just
a
close
friend,
in
that
situation
the
board
has
uniformly
required
more
in
the
way
of
a
showing
to
warrant
exclusion.
it
would
not
exclude
that
sort
of
a
relationship
purely
on
the
basis
of
a
relationship,
i
mean.
now,
we
think
that
the
board's
policy
as
it
is
implemented
at
least
for
the
past
fifteen
years
since
the
board
has
embraced
the
caravelle
policy,
does
further
the
basic
purpose
involved
in
defining
appropriate
units
because
the
board's
task
in
defining
these
units,
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
is
to
try
to
get
a
grouping
of
employees
that
is
going
to
make
for
efficient
collective
bargaining,
get
a
cohesiveness
of
economic
interests
and
try
to
minimize
conflicting
interests.
and
the
caravelle
policy
does
further
these
objectives.
as
the
board
has
pointed
out
in
its
decisions,
employee
relatives,
particularly
those
who
reside
with
owners
of
the
business,
have
an
access
to
management
not
shared
by
other
employees.
thus,
their
perceived
need
for
collective
representation
to
provide
such
access
differs
substantially
from
those
of
other
employees.
moreover,
employee
relatives
who
are
financially
dependent
on
the
owner
are
likely
to
be
motivated
by
other
considerations,
considerations
that
are
very
different
from
those
of
employees
that
do
not
have
this
relationship.
now,
this
is
apt
to
manifest
itself
not
so...
not
only
in
determining
whether
to
vote
for
the
union
or
not
vote
for
the
election...
union,
but
even
should
a
union
be
selected
in
the
plant,
in
terms
of
what
issues
to
present
for
collective
bargaining.
it
is
the
board's
judgment
that
you
are
apt
to
get
many
more
conflicts
in
that
stage
of
the
negotiation,
somewhat
analogous
to
the
conflicts
that
this
court
pointed
out
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass
in
concluding
that
retirees
were
not
appropriately
placed
in
the
same
bargaining
unit
with
active
employees.
so
in
short,
the
board's
policy
of
family
exclusion
furthers
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
of
ensuring
effective
collective
bargaining
and
avoiding
conflicts
in
bargaining
once
a
bargaining
agent
is
selected.
secondly,
the
exclusion
of
such
employee
relatives
furthers
collective
bargaining
in
that
the
presence
of
such
a
close
relative
in
union
discussions
is
likely
to
be
viewed
with
suspicion
and
distrust
by
the
other
employees
and
put
a
damper
on
union
deliberations.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
they
are
excluded
from
the
unit,
they
would--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--but
that
is
true,
of
course,
your
honor,
of
any
employee
who
is
excluded
from
a
unit
on
a
lack
of
community
of
interest
grounds,
and
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
employer
from
setting
up
equal
pension
rights
or
better
for--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--but
as
i
say,
that
is
a
problem
that
occurs
whenever
employees
are
excluded
from
a
unit
on
community
of
interest
grounds.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
are
treated
as
an
employee,
but
they
would
not--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--but
they
would
not
be
in
the
bargaining
unit.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
propriety
of
excluding
these
people
from
the
bargaining
unit
on
the
ground
that
they
do
not
share
the
same
community
of
interest
with
the
other
people
who
are
in
that
bargaining
unit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
they're
not.
it
may
be
possible
for
them
to
set
up
a
unit,
a
separate
unit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
are
not
like
managerial
employees
in
the
sense
of
who
would
be
excluded
from
all
rights
of
the
group.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
their
interests
are
found
to
be
more
allied
with
management
than
they
are
with
the
rank
and
file
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
are
excluded
from
the
bargaining
unit.
that
means
that
not
only
do
they
not
vote,
but
the
union
is
not
required
to
represent
them
in
that
unit.
if
the
union
wants
to
take
them
into
membership
on...
apart
from
that,
that's
a
matter
of
the
union's
membership
rules,
but
it
would
not
be
required
to
bargain
for
these
employees
on
behalf
of
the
unit
for
which
the
union
has
been
certified.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
puts
it
well.
it
is
somewhat
analogous
to
the
exclusion
of
managerial
employees
which
this
court
in
bell
aerospace
said
were
not
only
to
be
excluded
from
bargaining
units
from
other
employees,
which
is
as
far
as
the
board
went,
but
were
excluded
from
all
rights
under
the
act.
the
board
has
not
gone
that
far
with
respect
to
the
relatives,
but
the
underlying
principle
is
essentially
the
same,
and
the
board's
exclusion
principle
reserves
the
line
between
management
and
labor
which
this
court
in
bell
aerospace
and
also
in
yeshiva
indicated
that
the
congress
intended
to
draw
at
least
in
the
taft-hartley
amendments
to
the
act.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
just
have--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--two
small
points.
the
first
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
there's
actually
a
very
narrow
difference
between
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
agrees
that
if
you
had
special
job
status,
you
could
exclude
these
employees.
however,
the
court
requires
at
least
two
instances
because
there
was
one
instance
in...
of
special
status,
and
they
said,
in
connection
with
diane
sabo,
and
they
said
that
was
not
enough.
the
only
difference
is
whether
or
not
the
board
can
reasonably
conclude
that
there
are
certain
circumstances,
of
which
this
case
is
one,
where
the
nature
of
the
relationship
is
such
that
even
though
it
has
not
manifested
itself
in
special
job
privileges,
the
relationship
is
such
as
to
warrant
the
conclusion
that
the
employees
still
do
not
have
the
same
community
of
interest
with
the
other
employees.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
allowable
choice
of
the
board
to
make
in
the
exercise
of
its
section
9(b)
unit
determination
authority,
that
the
history
of
the
2(3)
exclusion
which
is
set
forth
at
page
26
of
our
brief,
which
is
a
wagner
act
exclusion,
gives
no
indication
whatsoever
that
congress,
in
putting
in
that
exclusion,
intended
in
any
way
to
restrict
the
board's
ability
to
define,
to
exclude
other
relatives
from
bargaining
units.
the
senate
report
says
that
the
exclusion
was
put
in
for
administrative
reasons.
the
committee
deemed
it
wise
not
to
include
under
the
bill
agricultural
laborers,
persons
in
domestic
service
of
any
family
or
person
in
his
home,
or
any
individual
employed
by
his
parent
or
spouse.
it
seems
evident
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
excluding
very,
very
localized
situations
that
they
thought
were
not
even
subject
to
the
board's
jurisdiction
at
all
and
were
not
at
all
focusing
on
the
problem
of
the
board's
ability
to
exclude
from
bargaining
units
employees
who
were
subject
to
the
board's
jurisdiction.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
yes.
well,
the
board
has
never
accepted
that
factor
of
linn
gear.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
some
courts
have.
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
fifth
have
added
it,
but
the
board
in
applying
the
factors
has
used
the
caravelle
articulation
of
the
test
which
does
not
include
this
factor,
and
the
board
has
never
applied
that
factor.
normally,
the...
so
based
upon
the
board
decisions
that
i
am
aware
of,
the
board
does
not
regard
that
as
an
appropriate
factor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
don't
think
that
it,
that
it
is
confined
to
that
situation.
i
think
that
it
could
be
a
factor
in
terms
of
the
potentiality
for
conflicts
in
the
bargaining
process
that
ensues.
i
mean,
if
you
have
one
relative
in
a
unit
of
50
employees,
the
potential
for
conflict
disrupting
the
bargaining
process
might
be
less
than
if
it
was
a
much
smaller
number.
well,
that
factor
was
not
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
the
cases
that
i
know
of
that
the
board
has
had
have
been
blood
relative
situations,
but
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
could
not
extend
beyond
that.
i
think
the
most
important
thing
is
not
only
the
relationship
but
the
role
that
the
relative
plays
in
the
ownership
and
management
of
the
business.
as
the
caravelle
criteria
have
been
applied,
special
status
has
been
required
where
you
have
had
relatives
who
either
had
no
ownership
interest
in
the
company
or
a
relatively
minor
one.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
perhaps
may
not
understand--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
special
status
means
that
you'd
have
to
have,
have
some
difference
in
job
benefits
and
privileges.
that
would
be
a
basis
for
excluding
individuals
from
bargaining
units
even
without
any
family
relationship
at
all.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
did
not.
the
board
found
special
privilege
in
respect
to
diane
sabo,
and
that
was
an
alternative
basis
for
the
board's
exclusion.
but
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
one
instance
was
not
enough,
and
we
are
not
