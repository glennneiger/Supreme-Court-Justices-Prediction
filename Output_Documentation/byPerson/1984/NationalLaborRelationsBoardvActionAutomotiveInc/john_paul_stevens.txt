mr.
come,
does
this
mean
if
the
exclusion,
if
they
are
excluded
from
the
unit,
that
they
obviously
couldn't
be
members
of
the
union,
i
guess
they
could
also
not
participate
in
pension
plans,
collectively
bargained
pensions
programs?
justice
stevens
they
would
be
excluded.
justice
stevens
except
sometimes
you
need
a
large
group
of
employees
to
fund
the
program,
i
suppose.
you
can't
have
a
special
fund
for
your
nephew
i
don't
think.
justice
stevens
mr.
come,
could
i
ask
just
one
question?
justice
stevens
in
your
brief
on
page
14,
in
footnote
7,
you
do
quote
from
the
linn
gear
case.
justice
stevens
the
first
of
the
factors
quoted
is
the
activity,
if
any,
of
the
employee
in
the
union.
justice
stevens
and
would
you
address
the
question
whether
you
think
that's
an
appropriate
factor
or
not?
justice
stevens
well,
i
think
your
brief
says
that
it
is
added
as
a
factor.
is
that...
what
your
brief
is
saying
now
is--
justice
stevens
--how
about
the
second
factor
there,
the
total
number
of
employees
as
compared
with
the
blood-related
number?
does
this
mean
that
it
depends
on
whether
the
family
people
are
apt
to
influence
the
outcome
of
the
election?
is
that
what
is
critical?
