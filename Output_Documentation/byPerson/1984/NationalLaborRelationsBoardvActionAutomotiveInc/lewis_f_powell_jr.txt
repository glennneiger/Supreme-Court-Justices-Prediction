mr.
come--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--both
your
brief
and
argument
have
spoken
in
terms
of
close
relatives.
what
about
people
who
are
very
close
together
but
who
are
not
blood
relatives
in
any
way,
shape
or
form?
does
the
caravelle
test
fit
those
people?
for
example,
it
often
happens
these
days
that
you
have
a
man
and
a
woman
living
together
who
are
not
married,
or
you
may
have
two
brothers
who
are
totally
at
odds
with
each
other,
for
whatever
reason,
they
may
live
in
the
same
house.
does
relationship
extend
beyond
blood
relationship
that
you
are
arguing
about?
your
brief
would
not
indicate
that
it
does.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
i
didn't
understand
caravelle
to
apply
the
special
status
rule,
and
what
you
just
said
suggests
that
the
board
would
consider
the
special
status
or
special
relationship.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
there
are
two
general
standards.
one
is
a
special
status
standard
applied
by
the
sixth
circuit,
and
the
other
is
the
caravelle
standard
applied
by
the
seventh,
and
they
are
quite
different
in
the
way
they
are
framed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
find
any
special
privilege?
