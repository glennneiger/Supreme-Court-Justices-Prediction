they
to
be

the
benefits
of

whole
thesis
is
that
they
are
tainted
with
the
managerial
taint,
isn't
it,
really?
chief
justice
burger
but

don't
think
i've
got

answer.

say
they
should
be
excluded
from
voting
in
this
first
step.

the
management,
is
that

something
further,

have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice

e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
come.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
