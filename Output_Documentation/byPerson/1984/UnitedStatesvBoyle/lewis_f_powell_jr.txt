justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this
before
you
move
on?
is
the
standard
that
ca-11
purports
to
follow
substantially
identical
with
the
standard
prescribed
by
the
regulations,
reasonable
care?
justice
jr.
don't
they
use
the
same
words,
essentially?
justice
jr.
are
you
advocating
the
rule
of
ca-5
and
a
couple
of
other
circuits,
that
the
duty
is
nondelegable
in
all
circumstances?
justice
jr.
you
are?
justice
jr.
that's
not
what
the
regulation
says.
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
with
respect
to
a
filing
date,
perhaps
you
are
right,
but
there
are
so
many
complications
in
preparing
some
tax
returns,
you
are
not
arguing,
i
suppose,
that
a
layman,
for
example,
has
to
assume
nondelegable
obligations
with
respect
to
things
of
which
he
knows
no--
