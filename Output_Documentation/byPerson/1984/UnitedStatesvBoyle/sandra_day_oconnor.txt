justice
o'connor
mr.
lauber,
would
you
apply
that
strict
per
se
approach
to
someone
such
as
a
mentally
retarded
person
who
inherits
property
and
has
to
file
a
return
and
relies
on
someone
like
a
lawyer
to
help
him?
would
you
really
want
to
stick
to
that
standard
under
any
and
circumstances
in
every
case?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
you've
added
something,
a
fiduciary
appointed,
and
that
was
not
part
of
my
inquiry.
would
you
agree
that
generally
speaking
these
heavy
penalties
don't
fall
on
people
who
are
indigent?
justice
o'connor
how
about
an
approach
like
that
suggested
by
judge
posner
in
his
dissent?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
isn't...
i
think
it's
not
quite
as--
justice
o'connor
--black
and
white
and
arbitrary
as
you've
described
yours,
as
i
read
it,
anyway.
justice
o'connor
well,
judge
posner
would
have
reserved
a
situation
for
that
person,
i
suggest.
justice
o'connor
you
would
require,
i
suppose,
that
the
taxpayer
have
a
solvent
tax
preparer.
he
should
be
sure--
