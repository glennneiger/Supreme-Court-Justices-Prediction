justice
marshall
well,
just
before
that,
and
along
the
same
line,
if
the
lawyer
misled
or
negligently
advised
the
executor
and
the
executor
was
penalized
for
it,
couldn't
the
executor
get
that
money
back
from
the
lawyer--
justice
marshall
--in
any
court
in
the
world?
justice
marshall
i
don't
see
how
you
say
that
we
put
the
weight
on
the
lawyer.
i
don't
consider
the
lawyer
in
this
case
at
all.
justice
marshall
well,
then,
i
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
marshall
the
man...
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
filing
the
certiorari
petition
on
time
in
this
court?
justice
marshall
what
happens
if
you
don't
do
it?
justice
marshall
yes,
but
what
happens
to
the
lawyer?
he
either...
at
least,
he
might
lose
a
client,
and
beyond
that
he
might
lose
a
good
deal
more,
is
that
not
so?
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
that
the
same
case
here?
because
of
the
lawyer,
the
only...
the
irs
could
not
penalize
the
lawyer,
right?
justice
marshall
under
any
law.
justice
marshall
so
they
have
been
done
in.
so
they
have
to
collect
from
somebody.
so
who
do
they
collect
from?
justice
marshall
the
lawyer
paid
it?
justice
marshall
well,
what,
what...
what
are
we
doing
with
the
case?
justice
marshall
what
are
we
doing
with
the
case?
justice
marshall
are
you
trying
to
get
your
money
back?
justice
marshall
that
would
help,
wouldn't
it?
justice
marshall
speaking
for
your
own
firm--
justice
marshall
--if
we
affirm
this
judgment,
can
we
assume
that
you'll
never
make
that
mistake
again?
justice
marshall
well,
is
there
any
other
way
we
can
do
it?
justice
marshall
is
there
any
other
way
we
can
do
it
other
than
affirming?
justice
marshall
how
would
three
months
figure
on
this?
it
was
three
months
in
this
case.
justice
marshall
wouldn't
that
be
close
to
willful?
justice
marshall
well,
the
executor
is
the
only
one
covered
by
the
law.
justice
marshall
the
government
can't
reach
anybody
but
the
executor.
justice
marshall
the
executor
didn't
have
to
get
a
lawyer.
justice
marshall
but
he
did.
justice
marshall
and
it's
whose
responsibility?
his,
and
nobody
else's,
is
that
right?
