mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
question
about
the
addition
to
the
tax
often
referred
to
colloquially
as
a
penalty
for
failure
to
file
a
tax
return
on
time.
section
6651(a)-1
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
that
in
case
of
failure
to
file
any
return
on
the
date
prescribed
therefor,
there
shall
be
added
to
the
tax
an
amount
up
to
a
total
of
25
percent
of
the
total
tax
due
unless
it
is
shown
that
such
failure
is
due
to
reasonable
cause
and
is
not
due
to
willful
neglect.
the
question
here
is
whether
a
taxpayer
can
demonstrate
reasonable
cause
for
a
late
filed
return
even
though
that
return's
late
filing
is
in
fact
attributable
to
negligent
by
citing
the
fact
that
he
relied
on
his
attorney
or
other
agent
to
prepare
the
return
for
him.
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute
below
and
are
not
very
complicated.
the
taxpayer
here
is
the
executor
of
an
estate.
among
the
duties
of
an
executor,
imposed
both
by
relevant
state
law
and
by
the
revenue
code,
is
the
duty
to
file
a
federal
estate
tax
return.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
we
think
the
same
reasoning
would
apply
to
an
income
tax
return,
a
gift
tax
return,
almost
any
kind
of
return.
here
the
executor
hired
a
lawyer
to
take
care
of
administering
most
of
the
estate's
affairs.
the
executor
met
with
the
lawyer;
he
was
told
that
the
estate
would
in
fact
be
required
to
file
a
federal
estate
tax
return.
the
executor
was
also
told
that
there
existed
a
specific
deadline
by
which
the
return
would
have
to
be
filed--
the
lawyer
in
fact
knew
what
that
correct
deadline
was,
namely,
a
date
nine
months
after
the
date
of
death,
but
the
lawyer
did
not
recall
having
informed
the
executor
of
the
exact
due
date,
only
that
there
was
a
due
date.
as
it
turned
out,
the
lawyer,
through
carelessness,
forgot
all
about
the
return
until
well
after
the
filing
period
had
elapsed.
as
a
result,
the
return
was
filed
three
months
late.
the
commissioner
determined
that
the
executor's
late
filing
was
not
due
to
reasonable
cause,
and
accordingly,
asserted
an
addition
to
the
estate
tax
in
the
appropriate
amount.
the
court
of
appeals
expunged
the
penalty.
it
recognized
that
under
longstanding
treasury
regulations,
the
determination
of
reasonable
cause
is
governed
by
an
objective
test,
that
is,
whether
the
taxpayer
exercised
ordinary
business
care
and
prudence
and
was
nevertheless
unable
to
file
the
return
within
the
prescribed
time.
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
here
the
executor's
late
filing
was
due
to
reasonable
cause.
it
relied
primarily
on
two
facts,
the
fact
that
the
executor
lacked
personal
knowledge
of
the
filing
date,
and
that
he
relied
on
his
attorney
to
prepare
the
return
for
him.
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
three
other
circuits
had
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
reliance
on
counsel
standing
alone
is
not
a
defense
to
the
late
filing
penalty
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
both
for
reasons
of
technical
tax
law
and
also
for
reasons
of
common
sense.
we
start
from
the
premise
that
where,
as
here,
it
is
clear
that
a
tax
return
is
required
to
be
filed,
the
taxpayer
has
a
personal
and
nondelegable
duty
to
file
that
return
on
time.
this
premise
we
think
follows
from
a
variety
of
code
provisions
that
state
that
the
taxpayer
shall
make
a
return,
he
shall
sign
the
return
under
penalties
of
perjury,
and
that
he
shall
file
it
by
a
specified
date.
the
personal
and
nondelegable
nature
of
his
timely
filing
obligation
has
been
recognized
by
almost
every
lower
federal
court
to
address
the
question,
and
we
think
from
this
premise
two
conclusions
inevitably
follow.
first
of
all,
because
the
taxpayer's
duty
to
file
on
time
is
personal,
he
has
a
concomitant
duty
personally
to
find
out
what
the
filing
date
is,
and
that
we
think
is
just
a
matter
of
common
sense.
if
a
person
knows
he
has
a
duty
to
perform
and
knows
it
must
be
performed
by
a
deadline,
ordinary
business
care
and
prudence
require
him,
plainly
require
him
to
find
out
what
that
date
is.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
we...
the
irs
tries
to
be
reasonable,
but
i
don't
think
they
would
be
inclined
to
be
particularly
clement
in
a
case
like
this,
and
i
will
try
and
explain
why
it
would
be--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
really
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
to
that
question.
and
secondly,
because
the
taxpayer's
duty
to
file
on
time
is
nondelegable,
he
cannot
escape
liability
for
a
late
filing
simply
by
having
somebody
else
prepare
the
return
for
him;
rather,
if
the
taxpayer
is
going
to
show
ordinary
business
care
and
prudence,
he
has
got
to
supervise
his
agent
and
make
sure
the
agent
gets
about
the
business
of
preparing
the
return.
moreover,
if
the
agent
is
negligent
himself,
that
negligence,
we
think,
under
agency
doctrine,
must
be
imputed
to
the
taxpayer
as
the
principal.
and
we
think
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
about
these
general
rules
in
the
area,
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
required.
here,
the
executor
knew
that
he
had
to
file
a
return;
he
knew
he
had
to
file
it
by
a
certain
date;
but
he
simply
failed
to
find
out
what
that
date
was.
he
also
failed
to
use
the
kind
of
care
that
an
ordinarily
prudent
businessman
who
faced
a
liability
would
use
in
making
sure
that
his
agent
was
prompt
in
preparing
the
return.
i
think
in
both
those
respects
the
taxpayer
was
negligent.
moreover,
the
attorney
was
plainly
negligent
because
he
forgot
about
the
return
altogether,
and
that
negligence
must
be
imputed
to
the
taxpayer.
and
since
both
of
them
were
negligent,
we
think
that
there
was
no
reasonable
cause
and
the
penalty
was
properly
assessed.
this
result,
we
think,
is
not
only
dictated
by
well-settled
tax
principles,
but
makes
perfect
sense.
and
here
it
is
helpful
to
recall
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
says
that
where
a
return
is
filed
late,
an
addition
to
the
tax
shall
be
imposed
unless
it
is
shown
that
the
failure
to
file
was
due
to
reasonable
cause.
here,
if
one
looks
at
all
the
acts
and
omissions
committed
by
the
executor
and
the
lawyer
that
in
fact
caused
the
return
to
be
filed
late--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
regulations
set
out--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--and
the
prior--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
only
thing
i
know
of
is
the
internal
revenue
manual
lists
eight
examples
of
cases
where
the
penalty
will
not
be
assessed,
and
they
are
listed
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
secret
law
on
the
subject.
but
the
irs
would
not
assess
the
penalty
if
it
looks
like
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
a
late
filing,
and
it
is
only
when
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
that
they
will
go
after
the
taxpayer.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
all
the
acts
and
omissions
that
actually
caused
the
late
filing
here,
it
could
not
be
shown
that
that
late
filing
had
a
reasonable
cause.
indeed,
the
cause
of
the
late
filing
was
failure
of
oversight
by
the
executor
and
carelessness
by
the
lawyer.
and
plainly,
if
one
person,
the
taxpayer,
had
committed
all
those
acts
and
been
guilty
of
all
those
omissions,
he
couldn't
possibly
escape
the
late
filing
penalty.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that's
right,
justice
rehnquist,
and
that
would
bring
me
to
defining
of
proper
scope
of
the
reliance
on
counsel
defense
which
i
was
going
to
get
to
shortly.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
he
certainly
could,
justice
marshall.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
would
think
so.
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
he
couldn't.
but
let
me
address
justice
rehnquist's--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
that's
hard
to
say,
justice
powell,
because--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--they
use
the
same
words,
but
they
really
did
not
apply
an
objective
test
because...
they
quoted
the
regulations
and
they
trotted
them
out,
but
when
they
performed
their
analysis,
they
didn't
use
an
objective
test.
they
looked
at
a
personal
knowledge
of
that
particular
executor.
he
didn't
know--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that
is
our
position.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
regulations
about
reasonable
cause
you
mean.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
regulations
about
reasonable
cause
say
that
the
executor
must
exercise
ordinary
business
care
and
prudence.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
and
our
position
is
that
ordinary
business
care
and
prudence
per
se
require
the
executor,
a,
to
find
out
the
due
date,
and
b,
to
make
sure
his
agent,
if
he
has
an
agent,
is
prompt
in
performing
his
agency
activity.
so
we
think
that
is
a...
that
is
per
se
inherent
in
the
notion
of
ordinary
business
care
and
prudence.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
oh,
exactly
right.
well,
perhaps
i
should
get
to
the
reliance
on
counsel
defense
point.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
simply
is
jurisdictional,
period.
one
has
to...
well,
i
think
that
is
a
good
analogy.
the
sanction
is
a
little
different.
it
is
a
monetary
sanction
rather
than
not
being
able
to
get
into
court,
but
i
think
it
must
be
policed
rigorously.
otherwise,
the
whole
system
just
will
crumble.
here,
the
court
of
appeals
did
reach
their
result
by
finding
that
reliance
on
counsel
defense
should
be
available
to
the
executor
here.
now,
we
of
course,
agree
that
reliance
on
counsel
in
appropriate
conditions
is,
may
be
a
defense
to
various
tax
penalties,
including
the
addition
to
the
tax
for
late
filing.
but
we
think
those
conditions
are
not
present
here.
the
law
is
fairly
clear
in
the
lower
courts
that
reliance
on
counsel
defense
is
available
where
basically
four
conditions
are
met:
the
taxpayer
must
consult
a
competent
attorney,
he
must
make
a
full
disclosure
of
all
the
facts,
the
attorney
must
opine
on
the
question
presented,
and
the
taxpayer
must
rely
in
good
faith
on
the
advice
given.
and
if
those
conditions
are
met,
it
is
normally
not
relevant
whether
the
lawyer
was
wrong.
but
here
we
think
this
doctrine
has
no
application.
the
attorney...
the
executor
did
not
request
any
legal
advice
from
the
attorney,
and
the
attorney
gave
him
no
legal
advice,
whether
erroneous
or
not.
it
was
clear
to
both
the
executor
and
the
lawyer
that
a
tax
return
had
to
be
filed.
it
was
clear
to
both
of
them
that
the
filing
date,
the
specific
deadline
for
filing
the
return,
the
lawyer
knew
what
the
deadline
was
and
did
not
advise
his
client
about
it.
so
the
whole
predicate
for
invoking
a
reliance
on
counsel
defense,
the
giving
of
a
reliance
on
legal
advice,
simply
is
not
present
here.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
personal
nondelegable
duty
doctrine
governs
the
case,
and
the
result
then
would
be
a
perfectly
sensible
result,
we
think,
for
all
concerned,
because
we
think
it
is
clear
here
that
if
the
taxpayer
himself
had
committed
all
the
steps
that
caused
late
filing,
he
would
clearly
be
liable
for
the
penalty.
what
the
court
of
appeals
basically
said
is
that
if
two
people,
the
taxpayer
and
his
agent,
commit
all
the
acts
and
omissions,
the
penalty
is
not
collectable,
that
it
kind
of
falls
between
the
two
stools.
the
irs
can't
collect
from
the
taxpayer
because
he
can
rely
on
his
agent
as
a
defense.
the
commissioner
can't--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--no.
as
far
as...
even
as
far
as
obligation--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--no,
we
would
not
go
that
far
in
our
position.
our
position
is
really
confined
to
the
timely
filing
of
the
return.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
as
to--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
hard
cases
make
bad
law.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
we
would
stick
to
our
standard
there.
if
you
had
an
incompetent
who
had
a
fiduciary
appointed
to
take
care
of
his
or
her
affairs,
i
think
the
fiduciary
is
an
alter
ego
of
the
incompetent,
and
they
are
stuck.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
they
generally
don't
because
the
penalty
is
one
quarter,
maximum,
one
quarter
of
the
tax
due.
if
there
is
no
tax
due,
generally
speaking,
there
is
no
penalty
in
the
estate
tax
area
at
least.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
is
5
percent
per
month
for
every
month
up
to
25
percent
that
the
return
is
late.
but
i
think
what
the
case
boils
down
to
is
a
fairly,
as
justice
marshall
said,
a
fairly
common
sense
proposition.
here,
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
is
that
the
irs
cannot
collect
from
the
taxpayer
because
he
relies
on
the
agent.
it
can't
collect
from
the
agent
because
the
agent,
not
being
a
taxpayer,
can't
be
liable
for
the
addition
to
the
tax,
and
the
result
is
the
irs
can
collect
from
no
one,
even
though
it
is
plain
in
that
precisely
what
congress
spoke
of
in
the
penalty
provision,
a
filing
not
due
to
reasonable
cause,
it
is
late,
has
happened.
and
we
think
this
outcome
just
makes
no
sense,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
or
tax
policy
or
common
sense
or
even
fairness
to
the
parties
involved.
congress
designed
the
late
filing
addition
to
the
tax
as
an
incentive
to
timely
payment
of
taxes.
it
is
designed
to
protect
the
revenue.
now,
the
effect
of
this
incentive
will
be
destroyed
if
a
taxpayer
can
escape
liability
for
a
negligent
late
filing
merely
by
having
somebody
else
prepare
his
return.
indeed,
the
harmful
effect
of
that
kind
of
holding
is
clear
because
literally
tens
of
millions
of
american
citizens
how
have
income
tax
returns
prepared
by
professional
return
preparers.
we
think
the
sensible
approach
in
this
kind
of
situation
where
the
negligence
is
somehow
shared
in
an
unclear
way
between
the
taxpayer
and
his
agent,
is
to
let
the
irs
collect
the
penalty
that
it
is
entitled
to
collect
under
the
statute,
let
the
taxpayer
and
his
agent
sort
out
among
themselves
who
will
bear
the
cost
of
the
penalty.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
we
would
advocate.
justice
marshall's--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--simple.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
he
did
have
that
final
sentence
that
let
us--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--by
all
means
have
an
escape
clause
for
the
truly
inexperienced.
we
think
that
is
wrong.
we
think
his
good
old
chicago
school
free
market
approach
is
the
correct
approach,
you
simply
let
the
people
who
are
at
fault
fight
it
out
among
themselves
by
a
malpractice
action
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
and
let
the
cost
fall
on
negligent
people.
but
the
irs
should
not
be
forced
to
bear
the
cost.
they
have
done
nothing
wrong.
they
are
entitled
to
their
penalty.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no,
because
here,
he
didn't--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--no.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
swygert,
he
was
the
one
who
wanted
to
have
the
malpractice
action
brought.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
they
are
quite
similar
because
judge
posner--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--and
we
think
that
makes
a
very
sensible
approach
in
which
a
taxpayer,
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
poor
incompetent
person
is...
have
to
pay
up,
he
world
surely
have
a
claim
against
the
lawyer--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--but
i
think
his
reservation
doesn't
fit
with
his
basic
theory
that
if
it
is
true
that
the
poor,
wronged
taxpayer
has
an
action
over,
or
for
reimbursement
against
a
lawyer,
why
make
an
exception
that
only
operates
to
hurt
the
irs
when
it
is
clearly
entitled
to
a
penalty
because
the
return
has
in
fact
been
filed
late
and
negligently.
and
as
long
as
a
taxpayer
is
made
whole
for
whatever
errors
his
agent
committed,
the
taxpayer
is
not
going
to
be
out
any
money,
and
the
irs
will
get
what
congress
wished
it
to
get
when
taxes,
returns
are
filed
late.
and
what
we
think
really
makes
no
sense
at
all
is
to
deprive
the
irs
of
the
penalty,
let
the
taxpayer
in
effect
borrow
money
from
the
government
at
will
and
let
the
negligent
lawyer
get
off
completely
free.
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
if
he
doesn't,
it's
his
fault
for
not
picking
a
very
good
tax
return
preparer.
i
think
most
of
them
must
be
bonded,
i
believe.
but
in
any
event,
the
irs
shouldn't
be
stuck
with
that,
left
holding
the
bag
there.
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the
analysis
of
a
statute
that
the
respondent
has
put
forward
in
his
brief.
respondent
nowhere
argues
that
the
executor's
conduct
here
amounted
to
ordinary
business
care
and
prudence
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulations.
he
contends
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
and
that
the
penalty
should
be
imposed
only
where
the
taxpayer
is
guilty
of
willful
conduct.
and
that
interpretation
we
think
simply
won't
wash
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
congress
drafted.
the
statute
says
that
the
penalty
is
collectable
unless
it
is
shown
that
the
failure
to
file
on
time
is
due
to
reasonable
cause
and
not
due
to
willful
neglect.
since
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
taxpayer,
and
since
the
terms
reasonable
cause
and
willful
neglect
are
used
conjunctively,
the
commissioner
has
an
option
of
proving
either
the
absence
of
reasonable
cause
or
the
presence
of
willful
neglect.
he
can
prove
either
one.
now,
of
course,
the
practice,
because
the
absence
of
reasonable
cause
is
basically
negligence,
it
is
easier
to
prove
that
than
to
prove
willful
activity
with
the
subjective
content.
but
the
fact
that
one
option
is
easier
than
the
other
for
the
commissioner
doesn't
mean
that
one
is
redundant.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
think
that...
i
don't
think
the
statute
is
incongruous,
but
i
agree
that
they
are
not
literally
opposites.
but
that
is
not
uncommon
in
the
revenue
code.
in
fact,
the
penalty
for
negligence
in
section
6653(a)
says
that
a
penalty
is
applicable
if
the
understatement
of
tax
is
due
either
to
negligence
or
to
intentional
disregard
of
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
that's
almost
certainly
true.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
guess
that's
an
accurate...
an
example
of
willful
neglect
might
be,
you
know,
a
tax
protester.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
they
do.
it
is
a
heightened
form
of
negligence.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
no,
i
didn't
draft
the
statute.
this
goes...
this
language
goes
back
a
long
way,
and
i
think
one
often
finds
in
these
old
provisions...
this
goes
back
to
1916...
a
certain
funny
way
of
drafting
them.
but
it
makes
perfect
sense.
what
the
statute
really
says
is
that
the
penalty
is
applicable
unless
the
taxpayer
proves
both
that
he
acted
reasonably
in
an
objective
sense
and
in
a
subjective
sense.
now,
i
agree
with
you
that
almost
invariably,
if
the
commissioner
proves
that...
if
a
taxpayer
proves
that
he
did
not
act
negligently,
he
could
not
have
acted
with
willful
negligence
either.
but
still,
the
statute
does
on
its
face
give
the
commissioner
an
option.
the
taxpayer
must
prove
both
the
absence
of
reasonable
cause...
both
the
presence
of
reasonable
cause
and
the
absence
of
willful
neglect,
and
it
is
plainly
up...
the
commissioner
is
plainly
able
to
assess
the
penalty,
therefore,
by
proving
that
reasonable
cause
did
not
exist
for
the
late
filing.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
have
two
points.
first,
on
the
question
of
mootness,
the
case
is
definitely
not
moot.
what
happened
here
is
the
estate
paid
the
penalty
and
filed
a
suit
for
a
refund,
for
$17,000,
about.
if
this
court
affirms
the
decision
below,
the
irs
must
pay
$17,000
to
the
estate.
if
it
reverses,
the
irs
pays
nothing.
and
the
arrangements
that
the
estate
and
the
lawyer
made
among
themselves
on
how
they
divvy
up
the
money
is
simply
not
relevant
to
this
court's
jurisdiction.
now,
on
the
question
of
statutory
construction,
i
should
point
out
that
since
1916
there
have
been
literally
thousands
of
cases
construing
the
late
filing
addition
to
the
tax
decided
by
the
federal
courts.
no
court
has
ever
adopted
or
even
suggested
the
interpretation
that
respondent
advocates
here,
i.e.,
that
only
willful
neglect
causes
the
penalty
to
be
assessed.
they
have
uniformly
addressed
the
question
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
there
was
reasonable
cause.
the
regulation
that
implements
what
we
think
is
the
correct
scheme
of
the
statute
has
been
in
effect
since
1918,
and
this
court's
cases
have
often
acknowledged
when
you
have
as
regulation,
particularly
a
tax
regulation,
in
effect
that
long,
congress
is
deemed
to
have
approved
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
they
did
not
because
they
focused
on
whether
or
not
this
particular
executor
actually
knew
himself
the
due
date,
and
whether
or
not
he
had
particular
experience.
the
question--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
they
thought...
they
looked
whether
he
acted
reasonably
given
his
particular
past
experience.
for
us
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
man
would
have
remained
ignorant
of
the
filing
date.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
there's
no
need
for
a
remand
because
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
negligence
was
committed.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
they
acted
like
they
applied
it,
but
because
they
erroneously
employed
the
reliance
on
counsel
defense,
which
was
not
available
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
the
statute
is
correctly
construed,
that
was
what
led
them
to
their
incorrect
result,
and
that
was
a
legal
error,
not
a
factual
error.
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
if
the
court
were
to
construe
the
statute
as
making
the
penalty
applicable
only
where
there
is
willful
neglect,
it
would
be
an
impossible
enforcement
burden
on
the
government.
thousands
of
returns
are
filed
late
every
year,
and
if
we
had
to
prove
on
a
case
by
case
basis
whether
or
not
the
taxpayer
or
his
agent
acted
willfully,
it
would
be
a
nightmare
for
the
courts
and
for
the
irs.
it's
much
better
from
an
enforcement
standpoint
as
well
as
being
correct
under
the
statute.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
a
bright
line
test.
and
what
the
revenue
service
has
done
in
implementing
the
reasonable
man
standard
is
to
define
a
number
of
categories
of
cases
which
per
se
will
be
reasonable
cause,
and
as
i
mentioned
to
you
before,
the
manual,
the
revenue
manual,
lists
eight
different
categories
of
cases,
for
example,
where
there's
an
unavoidable
postal
delay,
where
there
is
a
death
or
serious
illness
of
the
taxpayer
or
a
member
of
his
family,
where
the
taxpayer
is
unavoidably
absent
from
the
country,
where
the
service
gives
the
taxpayer
erroneous
legal
advice,
where
there's
a
destruction
or
a
casualty
to
the
taxpayer
and
his
property,
all
those
situations
amount
to
per
se
reasonable
cause,
and
that
let's
the
government
dispose
of
many
of
these
cases
without
litigation.
