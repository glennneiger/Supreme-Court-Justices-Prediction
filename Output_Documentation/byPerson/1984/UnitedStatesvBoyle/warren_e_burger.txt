chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
boyle.
mr.
lauber,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
well,
would
it
be
any
different
in
your
view
if
it
was
for
a
personal
return
and
he
was
involved
in
filing
the
return,
a
delinquent
return
as
an
individual?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
able
to
tell
us,
mr.
lauber,
if
you
know
whether...
what
is
the
policy
of
irs?
do
they
dispense
mercy
very
often
in
this
area?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
don't
mean
as
to
this
case.
are
there
many
dispensations
granted
in
a
given
year,
if
you
know?
do
they
forgive
late
filings
with
very
many
people?
chief
justice
burger
well,
somewhere
in
the
archives
of
irs,
in
the
law
department,
there
must
he
a
sort
of
code,
guidelines
as
to
when
this
dispensation
should
be
granted?
chief
justice
burger
i
mean
apart
from
the
regulations.
chief
justice
burger
there
must
be
some
explanatory
material
about
the
regulations
themselves.
chief
justice
burger
--do
you
think
there
is
any
analogy
between
filing
dates
of
this
kind
and
filing
dates
for
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court?
chief
justice
burger
even
though
the
executor
or
trustee
may
be
not
as
affluent
as
his...
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
or
of
the
estate,
nevertheless,
the
penalty
is
deliberately
aimed
by
congress
to
fit
the
size
of
the
problem,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
is
it
very
much
different
from
willful
negligence
as
against
ordinary
negligence?
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
courts
frequently
refer
to
willful
negligence,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
davies?
chief
justice
burger
well,
do
you
have
any
difficulty
understanding
the
statute?
chief
justice
burger
does
either
the...
mr.
boyle
or
your
firm
claim
that
they
locked
at
the
statute
and
didn't
understand
it,
and
that
that's
accounted
for
the
delay?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
the
case
is
any
different
if
the
executor,
boyle
himself
is
the
lawyer,
was
handling
his
own
affairs
and
made
the
same
mistake?
chief
justice
burger
in
what
respect?
chief
justice
burger
well,
doesn't
counsel
and
mr.
boyle
merge
into
one
entity
so
far
as
this
is
concerned?
chief
justice
burger
who?
who
do
you
mean
by
you?
chief
justice
burger
don't
you
think
the
malpractice
cases
take
care
of
that?
chief
justice
burger
well,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
bear
on
something
that
you
suggested,
and
i
feel
bound
to
ask
you,
are
you
representing
to
the
court
that
your
firm
has
reimbursed
mr.
boyle,
that
you
have
paid
the
penalty?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
is
there
possible
mootness
to
this
case?
mr.
boyle
has
suffered
no
loss.
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
you
are
saying,
conceding
that
your
private
arrangements
with
your
client
are
irrelevant
to
the
issues
of
this
case.
chief
justice
burger
but
if
you
are
one
day
late
in
filing
a
document
in
the
courts,
under
court
rules
or
statutes,
you
are
out
of
court.
that's
pretty
rough,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
unless
there's
some...
unless
it
is
demonstrable
that
the
united
states
mails
are
responsible
for
it,
as
often
happens.
chief
justice
burger
what
if
he
gives
it
to
his
chauffeur
and
says
take
this
down
and
mail
it
or
take
it
and
deliver
it
by
hand,
and
the
chauffeur
gets
drunk
and
forgets
all
about
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
that
reasonable
cause
in
your
view?
test
out
your
standard.
chief
justice
burger
an
employee,
he's
agent
of
the
taxpayer.
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
you
were
the
internal
revenue,
do
you
think
internal
revenue
should
impose
a
penalty
then,
or
should
they
forget
it?
chief
justice
burger
what
amount
of...
what's
the
rate
of
interest
on
the
delinquent
payment,
not
the
penalty,
the
rate
of
interest.
chief
justice
burger
so
the
government
pays
about
11
percent
to
borrow
money,
and
they
are
only
charging,
if
you're
correct,
they
would
only
be
charging
6
percent.
chief
justice
burger
well,
didn't...
isn't
it
possible
that
congress
put
this
penalty
that
you
regard
as
so
drastic
in
order
to
keep
the
interest
at
a
more
moderate
rate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
