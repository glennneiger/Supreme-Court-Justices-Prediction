justice
white
but
you
don't
go
any
farther
than
the
filing
date
and
the
fact
of
filing,
do
you,
for
a
per
se
rule?
justice
white
as
far
as
the
accuracy
of
the
return
or
the
intent
or
the
legal
problems
involved
in
it?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
i
mean,
if
you
had
the...
even
if
you
had
that,
that
final
sentence
wouldn't
save
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
justice
white
do
you
think
he
and
judge
swygert
take
the
same
position
on
this
issue?
justice
white
they
could
just
change
the
statute
a
little.
if
you
are
right
about
the
present
construction,
your
view
of
the
statute,
it
could
be
changed.
justice
white
to
agree
with
the
present
government's
regulation.
justice
white
well,
don't
you
have
to
convince
us
that
the
treasury
regulation
is
invalid,
under
the
statute,
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute?
justice
white
well,
alternative.
let's
suppose
the...
suppose
the
regulation
is
completely
valid.
justice
white
and
that
it
means
what
it
says.
justice
white
would
you
lose?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
so
you
think
he
used
reasonable
care.
justice
white
well,
do
you
agree
that
it
should
be
judged
on
an
objective
basis
under
the
regulations?
suppose
the
regulation
applies.
justice
white
so
it
would
be
the
objective
test,
and
then
you
would
just...
you
and
the
government
would
just
disagree
on
how
it
is
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
that
isn't...
wasn't
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it?
justice
white
so
you
think
they
applied
the
objective
test.
justice
white
but
on
one
of
your
arguments,
your
primary
argument,
or
the
argument
you
made
first,
would
require
us
to
hold
the
regulation
invalid.
justice
white
yes,
okay.
justice
white
well,
do
you,
assuming
that
the
regulation
is
valid,
as
you
say,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
proceed
on
an
objective
basis?
justice
white
you
don't
think
they
concluded
that
he
acted
reasonably?
justice
white
all
right.
assuming,
assuming
that
you
are
right
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
standard,
shouldn't
we
remand?
justice
white
well,
it
requires
an
assessment
of
the
facts
under
a
reasonable
man
standard
which
you
say
they
didn't
apply.
justice
white
in
other
words,
a
bright
line.
