mr.
thomas
e.
davies
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
response
to
a
question
a
few
moments
ago,
mr.
lauber
in
effect
admitted
that
perhaps
the
statute
wasn't
drafted
very
adequately.
he
actually
used
the
term
funny.
well,
we
couldn't
agree
more,
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--yes,
sir,
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
understanding
the
statute,
and
i
think
as
judge
posner
pointed
out,
the...
it
sets
up
two
conditions
which
i
believe
are
almost
the
opposite
of
one
another.
our
contention
is
that
by
adding
those
additional
words,
that
something
was
intended
beyond
mere
negligence
for
reasonable
cause
before
a
penalty
is
invoked.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
no...
for
the
delay
in
filing
the
return?
i
think
the
answer
to
the
reason
for
the
delay
was
that
there
was
a
mistake,
it
was
not
posted
on
the
calendar,
and
was
simply
forgotten.
there
is
no
other
explanation,
sir.
it
was
a
mistake.
clearly
there
was
no
intent
or
any
reason
to
try
to
buy
an
extra
three
months'
time
to
become
embroiled
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
a
big
difference
in
that
case.
i
think
you're--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--i
think
you're
looking
at
a
situation
where
you
have
the
average
layman,
he
comes
in,
he
hires
an
expert,
a
person
he
is
relying
on
and
trusting.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
statute
directs
its
attention,
and
the
cases
heretofore
have
always
said
the
standard
involved
is
one
placed
on
the
taxpayer,
and
i
think
we
are
getting
a
little
bit
off
the
boat,
so
to
speak,
by
focusing
our
attention
on
the
attorney.
it
may
well
be
that
there
ought
to
be
a
law
that
says,
okay,
if
you
file
a
return
late,
or
you
cause
it,
then
you
pay
the
penalty.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
the
attorney
or
the
accountant?
that
may
be--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--they
should.
in
most
cases,
i
believe
they
should.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well,
i
don't
either,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--well--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--you're...
i
think
it's
jurisdictional.
you
lose
out.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
i
think
he's
at
fault.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
we
are
not--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--under
the
existing
law,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
that
is
correct--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--well,
in
this
particular
case,
and
i
would
hope
in
most
cases,
the
lawyer
would
admit
his
mistake,
as
we
did,
and
paid
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well,
i
think
the
question
is,
in
looking--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--well,
when
the
case
started
out--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--well,
that
would
happen
is--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--if
the
seventh
circuit
was
affirmed,
but
i
would
respectfully
point
it
out...
point
out
when
this
case
started
that
if
we
had
been
in
perhaps
any
other
circuit,
there
probably
would
not
have
been
a
case.
however,
in
the
seventh
circuit,
it
seemed
to
us,
under
the
rohrabaugh
case
there
was
clear
authority
which
at
least
up
until
this
point
has
been
agreed
upon
that
this
case
did
fall
under
that
narrow
exception.
now,
i
think
that...
and
trying
to
get
back
to
what
the
chief
justice's
question
is,
well,
what
is
the
difference,
i
think
you
have
to
also
realize
that
we
are
talking
about
the
average
layman.
now,
let's
assume
hypothetically
that
person
comes
into
the
attorney's
office...
it
is
after
the
death,
we
will
say,
of
a
loved
one...
someone
who
has
never
handled
anything
before,
or
had
very
little.
we've
even
had
people
that
probably
never
even
wrote
a
check;
they
are
a
65
year
old
widow,
suddenly
they
don't...
they
don't
know
what
to
do.
they
come
in,
they
see
their
attorney.
now,
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
it's
not
unreasonable
for
that
person
to
rely
on
their
attorney
to
do
something.
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
i
believe,
suggest
that
mr.
boyle
did
everything
that
the
average
person
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
do.
he
kept--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
i
certainly
hope
so,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
pardon?
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well,
i
believe
not,
not
if
the
government's
position
is
accepted.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
the
question
was
asked.
we
have,
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
i
guess
you
could
technically
say
that.
i
am
just
answering
the
question
honestly.
when
the
bill
came,
you
know,
it
was
our
fault,
we
paid
it.
there's--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--yes,
we
would.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes,
sir,
i
believe
there
is,
and
i
believe
there's
also
the
overall
question
that...
of
the
per
se
rule,
which
i
believe,
and
it
is
probably
my
understanding
is
why
this
case
was
granted
by
this
court.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes.
well,
there
would
also
be
the
question
of
interest.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes,
sir.
i
think
it's
necessary
to
look
at
the
statute
in
question,
and
that
is
really
the
key,
in
my
opinion,
of
how
this
should
be
decided.
congress
did
not
provide
for
an
absolute
penalty
that
could
be
invoked
in
all
circumstances.
i
would
certainly
agree
that
that
is
certainly
their
prerogative.
but
i
am
suggesting
to
this
court
by
the
insertion
of
the
words
reasonable
cause
and
not
due
to
willful
neglect,
suggests
that
congress
recognizes...
recognized
that
it
may
in
fact
be
inequitable
or
unfair
under
certain
circumstances
to
unilaterally
provide
for
an
absolute
penalty
or
absolute
rule.
now,
that
is
certainly
within
their
prerogative
to
do
that,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
they
have
not
chosen
to
do
that.
as
judge
posner
indicated,
that
the
addition
of
the
words
willful
neglect
would
seem
to
modify
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
reasonable.
the
only
sense
that
we
can
infer
that
that
means
is
that
congress,
by
using
the
words
willful
and
neglect,
intended
that
the
penalty
be
imposed
only
in
those
circumstances
where
the
person...
the
failure
to
file
was
due
to
more
than
mere
inadvertence.
the
government
suggests
there
is
a
two-part
test.
well,
as
we
raised
in
our
brief...
and
i
have
yet
to
be
able
to
figure
out
how
it
would
happen...
is
how
a
person
could
pass
the
reasonable...
pass
the
willful
neglect
portion
of
the
test
and
otherwise
fail
the
reasonable
cause
test.
i
don't
think
that
can
be
done.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well,
i'm
saying
the
additional
words
seem
to
me,
because
what
they
say
is
reasonable
cause
as
an
ordinary
man
standard,
or
shall
we
say,
negligence,
which
normally
does
not
connotate
a
willful
action.
i'm
saying
those
additional
words
were
either
put
there
for
emphasis
or
for...
to
indicate
that
something
beyond
the
so-called
reasonable
man
standard
would
apply.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
i
think
more
than
mere
negligence.
i
think
first
you
look
at
what
the
person
did,
whether
that
was
reasonable,
and
secondly,
whether
those
actions
were
willful,
and
why
did
he
fail
to
file
the
return?
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes.
i
think
under
way
the
law
is
written,
there
was
certainly
no
intentional
or
willful
desire
to
avoid
filing
the
return
on
time.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
not
necessarily.
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
just
because
they
didn't
say
under
traditional
view
willfully
decide
not
to
file
it,
they
could
have
otherwise
acted
unreasonably.
say,
for
instance,
in
this
case,
mr.
boyle...
and
i
think
this
is...
there's
a
difference
in
this
case
as
to
many
of
the
others...
he
kept
in
constant
contact
with
the
attorney.
he
called
the
office.
he
said,
you
know,
is
there
something
i
should
be
doing?
when's
the
return
going
to
be
filed?
he
was
told
don't
worry
about
it.
i
think
that's
a
far
different
situation
than
the
executors
you
have
seen
in
some
of
the
other
cases
who
does
not
do
anything
and
in
fact
abandons
ship,
so
to
speak,
and
takes
no
active
part
in
the
administration
of
the
estate.
i
would
further
say
that
i
believe
congress
intended
something
more
than
the
reasonable
man
standard,
because
if
you
look
at
what
does
statute
provide
for,
we
are
suggesting...
and
it
seems
to
us
it
is
a
penalty.
now,
the
government
in
their
reply
brief
and
in
their
argument
didn't
really
want
to
use
that
term,
but
they
certainly
did
in
their
original
brief,
and
it
seems
to
us
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
that
if
you
file
a
return
one
day
late
and
are
assessed
5
percent
interest,
that
that
computes
out
to
be
a
pretty
harsh
and
pretty
severe
punishment.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
that's
correct,
sir,
and
i
doubt--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--right.
i
am
not
saying
that
there
shouldn't
be
certainty
in
many
things.
however,
i
am
suggesting
under
this
statute
congress
did
not
suggest
that.
they
could
very
easily
write
a
statute
that
says,
okay,
you
file
it
on
time
or
pay
a
penalty,
and
be
done
with
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well,
i
think
you
have
to
look
not
only
at
what
they
did
up
to
the
time
that
they
learned
whether
the
return
was
late,
and
then
what
did
they
do
when
they
learned
of
it?
i
think
in
a
lot
of
these
other
cases
the
taxpayer
said
so
what
and
waited
nine
months.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
i
think
the
standard
would
be
probably,
if
you
are
putting
it
on
a
scale
of
negligence,
gross
negligence.
i
think
when
you
use
the
word
willful,
i
think
you
are
into
gross
negligence.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes,
i
think,
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes,
three
months
and
a
day.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well,
except
for
the
fact
that
what
the...
what
was
the
reason.
i
think
it's
a...
again,
looking
at
what
the
executor
did,
it's
easy
now
to
say,
well,
sure,
i
guess
he
should
have
known
the
exact
date,
but
looking
at
what
the
executor
did--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--right.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
that
is
correct,
but
i
am
saying
in
looking
at
the--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--right.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
that
is
correct.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
looking
at
what
the
executor
did,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
what
the
attorney
should
or
shouldn't
do.
the
standard
as
courts
have
looked
at
before
said,
now,
what
did
the
executor
do.
i'm
suggesting,
if
we
all
think
about
it,
or
think
about
mrs.
rohrabaugh
or,
say,
someone
who
for
some
unfortunate
reason
doesn't
have
all
their
mental
facilities
or
whatever,
if
they
hire
an
attorney
and
they
call
them
and
they
are
told
that
everything
is
going
to
be
taken
care
of,
i
don't
think
that's
so
unreasonable
for
that
person
to
assume
that
it's
going
to
be
taken
care
of.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well,
i
agree
that's
probably
a
problem
or
a
question
of
fact
that
has
to
be
determined.
i
can't
give
you
a
good
answer
as
to
how
easily
that
could
be
done,
but
questions
of
fact
are
determined
in
life
and
death
cases
and
other
cases.
i
can't
say
that--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--well,
i
believe
they
could,
but--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--that
is
correct--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--i
believe
it
could.
i
believe
there's
innumerably
better
ways
to
handle
this
situation,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
should
have
to
sit
here
and
try
and
figure
out
what
they
are.
that's
not
your
job.
you've
been
stuck
with
this
case.
i
think
you
can
look
at
it
one
of
two
ways.
sure,
you
can
make
a
decision
and
make
this
whole
thing
better,
or
i
think
what
needs
to
be
done
is
to
say,
well,
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
you
didn't
write
it.
if
they
want
something
clearer
or
something
more
absolute,
all
they
have
to
do
is
change
it.
now,
the
second
part,
even
assuming
that
my
construction
or
our
construction
of
this
statute
is
all
wrong,
or
that
it
is
something
you
can't
accept...
and
there's
certainly
arguments
for
not
accepting
it,
but
then,
let's
look
at
the
second
part
of
it
is
whether
or
not
the
per
se
rule
as
advocated
by
the
government
should
be
adopted.
we
suggest
that
that
should
not
be
because
it
is
not
in
conformity
with
what
the
statute
sets
out
to
do.
that
would
in
effect
be
an
absolute
rule
which
would
mean
in
all
cass...
now,
this
is
only
an
estate
tax
case,
but
presumably
in
all
cases,
then,
that
it
would
be,
or
reliance
on
counsel
or
another
tax
preparer
would
not
be
any
defense.
now,
the
government
in
their
reply
brief
brought
up
the
willis
case
which
was
recently
decided
in
the
fourth
circuit.
now,
there's
a
situation
where
a
taxpayer
comes
in,
signs
the
return,
leaves
it
with
his
accountant.
is
that
unreasonable?
let's
say
that's...
that
case
was
eighteen
days
before
the
deadline,
leaves
it
with
his
preparer.
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable
for
him
to
presume
that
it
will
be
mailed.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well,
i
think...
i
think
that's
why
the
statute
is
written
that
says
reasonable
cause.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
giving
it
to
your
chauffeur?
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
i
would
say
that
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
that's
done.
would
i
personally--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--do
i?
not
under
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
no,
i
don't,
and
that's
why
i'm
suggesting
that
they
had
an
exception.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
the
executor
had
called
on
numerous
occasions
wondering--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
wondering
when
the
return
would
be
due,
or
thinking,
you
know,
i
know
we
have
to
file
a
return
because
i
was
told
that.
i
mean,
there's
no
question,
and
i
deeply
resent
the
inferences
of
the
government
that
there's
any
dishonesty
here,
the
attorney
said...
if
he
was
going
to
make
up
a
story,
he
could
have
made
up
a
lot
better
one...
the
record
says,
well,
sure,
i
told
mr.
boyle
that
there
was
a
federal
estate
tax
return
due,
and
so
all
mr.
boyle
said,
well,
he
didn't
know
when
it
was,
he
knew
there
was
one
due,
and
that's
why
he
had
his
wife
keep
calling.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well,
on
several...
the
record
does
not
say
the
exact
number
other
than
he
called
on
numerous
occasions
saying--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--i
can't
say
that
it
was
always
that.
i
think
more
than
once.
i
can't
say
exactly.
i
can
say
as
late
as
april
when
they
sold
some
farmland
that
they
asked,
and
that
there
is
no
question
about
it,
that
they
should
have
remembered
at
that
time
because
the
june
filing
date
was
coming
on.
and
they
continued,
and
then
finally
in
september
they
thought,
well,
gee,
this
sure
seems
like
a
long
time,
and
then
suddenly
the
light
went
on.
so
it's
not
like
they
just
turned
the
file
over
to
the
attorney
and
walked
away
and
said,
well,
let
me
know
how
it
works
out.
i
think
that
is
a
big
difference.
however,
under
the
per
se
rule
as
advocated
by
the
government,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
he
did.
mr.
boyle
would
be
treated
the
same
as
other
taxpayers
who
never
checked
up
or
never
did
anything.
mr.
boyle
or
mrs.
rohrabaugh,
for
that
matter,
what
difference
would
it
have
made?
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
clear
difference
between
the
fact
that
somebody
knows,
is
made
aware
of
the
fact
they
made
a
mistake,
they
should
file
their
return.
now,
in
this
case
mr.
boyle
did
that
in
a
week.
okay,
now,
granted
that
held
the
penalty
down
to
20
percent
instead
of
25,
all
he
could
have
lost
was
another
5
percent.
however,
he
would
be
treated
the
same
as
somebody
who
is
told,
let's
say,
in
september
this,
that
hey,
your
return
is
late.
he
says,
ah,
i'm
not
going
to
worry
about
it.
two
years
later,
well,
we'll
file
it.
now,
there
are
several
cases
like
that.
if
you
talk
about
incentives,
i
think
under
the...
there's
a
big
difference
between
the
two
parties
there.
i
would
further
just
like
to
touch
on
a
couple
of
the
policy
and
common
sense
arguments
that
the
government
says
make
this
so
clear.
they
suggest,
well,
it
would
be
easier
to
collect.
sure
it
might
be,
but
tell
congress
that.
don't
tell
this
court
that.
that's
not
a
decision
that
you
have
to
make.
or
maybe
we
would
have
a
better
scheme.
well,
this
court
has
pointed
out
before,
let
congress
come
up
with
that
scheme.
if
in
fact
there
is
such
a
serious
revenue
drain
because
of
this
narrow
little
exception,
don't
you
think
congress
would
change
the
law,
not
ask
this
court--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--as
an
alternative
argument,
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
okay.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
okay.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
not
necessarily.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
i,
what
i...
okay,
what
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
unreasonable
for
mr.
boyle
or
mrs.
widow
or
we
could
think
of
a
lot
of
sad
cases--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--yes,
i
think
so.
i
am--
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
--yes,
i
do
believe
it
should
be.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
that's
one
way
to
look
at
this
case,
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
well,
i
think
it
was
on
their
holding.
they
said
that,
the
seventh
circuit
holding
said,
okay,
we
find
these
facts
to
be
present,
and
therefore
we
find
that
in
this
case
it
was
reasonable
for
mr.
boyle
to
rely
on
his
attorney.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes,
i
do.
the
main
bone
of
contention,
as
i
see
it,
was
that
judge
posner
thought
that
mr.
boyle
was
more
experienced
than
mrs.
rohrabaugh.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
on
that
argument.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
at
this
time
it
was
6
percent.
now,
i
believe
that's
raised
to
a
floating
rate
now.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
at
this
time.
now,
i
think
that...
i
believe
that's
foolish,
your
honor,
and
i
think
they've
changed
it,
but
that's
not
our
fault.
i
believe
there
can
be
proper
incentives
by
charging
an
appropriate
rate
of
interest.
mr.
thomas
e.
davies
it's
possible.
i
don't
know
the
legislative
history
on
that.
i
believe
they
have
raised
the
6
percent,
like
if
you
file
your
income
tax
return
late
or
you
don't
pay
the
money,
i
should
say,
you
would
pay
11
or
12
percent,
say,
and
that's
adjustable.
at
this
particular
time
it
was
6
percent.
now,
one
other
thing
i
would
point
out
is
that
on
the
per
se
rule,
what
about
the
widow
or
the
person
who
can't
collect
from
the
attorney?
does
that
person
really
get
a
fair
shake,
and
did
congress
really
intend
to
penalize
that
person?
i
suggest
that
congress
did
not
and
they
allowed
a
narrow
exception
which
the
courts
have
made
in
this
particular
case
and
i
think
in
the
willis
case.
i
don't
think
it's
that
the
seventh
circuit
is
necessarily
out
there
all
alone.
thank
you.
