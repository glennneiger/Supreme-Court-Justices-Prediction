justice
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
the
taxpayer
should
be
able
to
rely
on
the
doctrine
of
advice
of
counsel
since
it
really
was
the
lawyer's
failings
that
prevented
the
thing
from
being
filed
on
time.
justice
rehnquist
--well,
is
there
a
kind
of
a
lacuna
between
reasonable
cause
and
willful
neglect?
justice
rehnquist
if
you
prove
reasonable
cause,
you
would
surely
prove
that
the
failure
to
file
was
not
from
willful
neglect,
i
assume.
justice
rehnquist
except
what
is
willful
neglect?
that
in
itself
is
a
contradiction
in
terms.
neglect
suggests
unconsciousness
or
carelessness
of
what
you
are
doing,
willful
suggests
and
intent.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
is
a
very
artistic
way
of
speaking
about
negligence,
to
speak
of
willful
negligence?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
is
a
two-part
test
that
is
phrased
in
the
conjunction,
i
guess,
because
they
use
the
word
and.
the
taxpayer,
in
order
to
avoid
the
penalty,
has
to
show
that
the
failure
is,
first,
due
to
reasonable
cause
and
not
due
to
willful
neglect.
now,
if
he
fails
the
first
hurdle,
if
he
can't
show
that
it
is
not
due
to
reasonable
cause,
you
never
get
to
the
willful
neglect.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
i
think
that
argument
cuts
in
favor
of
the
government,
not
you.
do
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
perhaps
reasonable
cause
should
be
read
as
mere
negligence,
or
not
due
to
mere--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
what
if
a
judge
were
to
find
in
this
case
that
the
preparer's
actions
were
negligent
but
they
were
not
due
to
willful
neglect?
now,
do
you
think
on
those
findings
you
ought
to
win?
justice
rehnquist
but
does
the
absence
of
willful
neglect
by
itself
prove
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
that's
a
twisting
of
the
language.
