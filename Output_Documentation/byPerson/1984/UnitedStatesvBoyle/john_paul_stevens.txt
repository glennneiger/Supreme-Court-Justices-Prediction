he
dissented
in
the
earlier
seventh
circuit
case.
justice

they
are
not
both
from
the
chicago
school,
you
know.
justice
stevens
well,
what
if,
what
if
you
win
this
case?
are
you
going
to
get
it
back?
justice
stevens
so
the
case
isn't
moot
then.
assuming
there
is
something
riding
on
the
outcome
of
the
case.
justice
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
it
still
has...
there
still
has
to
be
a
case
with
controversy.
justice
stevens
between
your
client
and
the
government.
justice
stevens
mr.
davies,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
what
does
the
government
do
with
the
problem
that
all
lawyers
are...
i
wish
they
were,
but
they're
not
all
as
honorable
as
the
members
of
your
firm,
and
you
do
have
the
possibility,
i
suppose,
of
a
dishonest
taxpayer
who
had
an
accountant
or
a
lawyer
who
is
willing
to
say
i
forgot
about
it
for
two
months
and
then...
how
can
the
government
disprove
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
stevens
congress
could
settle
that.
