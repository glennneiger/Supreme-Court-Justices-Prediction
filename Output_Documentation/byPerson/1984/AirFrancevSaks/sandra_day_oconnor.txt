justice
o'connor
mr.
johnson,
the
language
in
article
18
dealing
with
property
damage
uses
the
word
18.
in
article
17,
dealing
with
personal
injury,
it
uses
"accident".
do
you
think
that
the
recovery
standards
are
different
for
property
damage
or
baggage
than
they
are
for
personal
injury?
justice
o'connor
the
drafters
of
the
convention
then,
did
they
have
greater
concern
for
property
damage
than
for
personal
injury
recovery?
justice
o'connor
is
there
something
in
the
minutes
of
the
drafting
of
the
convention
to
which
we
might
refer
that
would
point
to
this
difference?
justice
o'connor
what
about
the
terrorist
attack
causing
injuries
to
a
passenger?
how
does
that
fit
in
with
your
analysis?
justice
o'connor
and
you
would
think
there
would
be
liability
on
the
carrier
for
that?
justice
o'connor
how
about
an
assault
on
a
fellow
passenger
in
a
perfectly
normal
flight?
justice
o'connor
but
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be
the
view
of
even
the
cases
that
have
gone
in
the
direction
you
are
urging
us
to
take,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
wouldn't
there
be
some
dispute
about
that
response--
justice
o'connor
--in
the
cases
that
we
have?
justice
o'connor
the
solicitor
general's
brief
argues
that
the
montreal
agreement
was
designed
to
provide
prompt
resolution
of
claims
against
airlines.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
how
your
view
of
this
complicated
litigation
of
proximate
cause
is
going
to
achieve
that
end.
and
how
is
the
average
passenger
in
a
position
to
establish
these
things
that
you
think
have
to
be
established
to
impose
liability?
justice
o'connor
well,
quite
apart
from
your
concern
about
the
adoption
of
a
new
treaty
or
amendments
to
the
warsaw
convention,
i
asked
you
about
the
effect
of
the
montreal
agreement
as
modifying
the
treaty
that
we
have
before
us
today,
and
the
purpose
of
that,
according
to
our
solicitor
general,
was
to
facilitate
prompt
resolution
of
claims.
and
i
don't
see
how
your
view
moves
in
that
direction.
justice
o'connor
no,
it
was
non-responsive
to
my
question,
and
i
am
satisfied.
justice
o'connor
how
about
terrorist
attacks?
justice
o'connor
under
your
view,
then,
there
would
be
no
airline
liability
for
injuries
caused
to
passengers
by
terrorists?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
i
understand
your
view,
injuries
inflicted
intentionally
by
another
person
upon
a
passenger
do
not
impose
liability
on
the
airline,
so
i
assume
that
under
your
present
view
there
would
be
no
liability
for
the
terrorist
attack.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
modifies
the
warsaw
convention
somehow?
justice
o'connor
that
the
convention
is
modified
by
virtue
of
the
holding
that
we
would
potentially
make
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
it
sounds
like
that
is
your
argument.
justice
o'connor
suppose
we
don't.
it
sounds
like
you
are
arguing
then
that
the
result
of
that
is
a
modification
of
the
warsaw
convention
itself.
