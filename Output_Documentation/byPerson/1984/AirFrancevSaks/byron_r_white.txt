what
about
a
passenger
who
chokes
to
death
on
his
food?
that
happens
in
the
best
of
restaurants.
what
about
that?
justice
white
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not.
it
doesn't
sound
like
it
is
for
you.
justice
white
what
about
that
one?
justice
white
but
if
a
passenger
drinks
too
much
and
gets
up
and
trips
and
falls
because
of
that,
that
would
be
covered
because
the
carrier
has
a
duty
not
to
serve
passengers
too
much
to
drink?
justice
white
yes.
but
if
a
passenger
is
just
cleaning
his
fingernails
and
accidentally
sticks
himself,
that
wouldn't
be
covered,
i
guess.
justice
white
--how
do
you
apply
the
unpredictability
to
the
loss
of
hearing,
a
person
who
has
never
had
any
problem
flying
before,
but
he
suddenly
has
a
very
unpredictable
ear
problem?
justice
white
so
there
must
be
something
else
besides
unpredictability,
i
would
think.
justice
white
there
has
to
be
something
that
is
connected
with,
what,
flying,
or--
justice
white
--what
about
weather?
justice
white
what
do
you
mean,
no?
you
don't
agree
with
that?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose...
justice
rehnquist
asked
you
what
content
do
you
give
to
the
word
"accident".
i
suppose
at
least
you
give
it
a
meaning
of
there
being
an
unintentional
injury.
that
is
one
of
the
definitions
of
accident,
i
suppose.
justice
white
would
the
warsaw
convention
limit
the
liability
of
a
carrier
if
one
of
its
employees
deliberately
assaulted
a
passenger?
justice
white
exactly.
because
it
is
no
longer
an
accident.
justice
white
because
of
some
other
provision
in
the
convention?
justice
white
is
that
in
the
convention?
justice
white
it
is
as
though
the
warsaw
convention
had
never
been
adopted.
justice
white
i
thought
you
said
that.
justice
white
so
you
are
saying
that
before
an
airline
can
ever
be
liable
for
anything
there
has
to
be
an
accident.
justice
white
and
if
there
is
an
accident,
it
is
then
subject
to
limitation.
