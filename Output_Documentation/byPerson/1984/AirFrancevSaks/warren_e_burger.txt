chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
air
france
against
saks.
if
you
will
give
us
a
moment
or
two
here.
mr.
johnson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
there
were,
i
would
rather
assume
that
the
plaintiff
would
make
it
a
point
of
showing
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dubuc.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question,
unless
justice
o'connor
wishes
you
to
pursue
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
burger
were
there
any
other
hearing
losses
of
any
other
passengers
on
that
day
and
on
that
flight?
chief
justice
burger
wouldn't
you
think
that
is
a
somewhat
important
predicate
for
your
case?
chief
justice
burger
suppose,
then,
suppose
that
she
was
the
only
one
out
of
225
passengers,
she
is
the
only
one
that
suffers
this.
you
are
suggesting
that
would
stand,
that
would
be
a
compensable
injury?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
put
this
one
to
you.
suppose
someone
comes
on
board,
a
lawyer,
and
puts
his
briefcase
with
five
heavy
books
in
on
the
open
overhead
rack,
and
the
general
practice
of
airlines
is
that
they
don't
let
you
put
heavy
things
up
there.
then
some
turbulence
occurs,
whatever
degree,
and
the
briefcase,
with
five
or
six
or
seven
u.s.
reports
in
it,
falls
on
the
head
of
a
passenger.
now,
that
is
an
accident,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
and
it's
an
accident
that
could
have
been
prevented
if
the
airline
had
enforced
its
own
rules.
chief
justice
burger
so
the
injured
fellow
who
got
these
books
on
his
head,
this
briefcase
on
his
head,
has
got
a
case,
hasn't
he?
chief
justice
burger
but
then
to
go
to
one
of
the
recent
questions,
you
do
not
claim
that
any
other
person
on
this
plane
suffered
any
hearing
problem.
chief
justice
burger
do
we
know
how
many
people
were
on
the
plane?
was
that
alleged
in
the
pleadings?
chief
justice
burger
but
your
earlier
answer
in
effect
would
repeal
the
warsaw
convention
so
far
as
the
limits
are
concerned.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
convention
is
to
put
a
limit
which
initially
was
$8,333
translated
from
french
francs,
but
if
you
say
that
you
can
go
in
with
common
law
action,
then
you
might
as
well
tear
the
treaty
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
johnson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
minutes...
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
burger
what
would
be
the
theory
of
the
case?
chief
justice
burger
what
would
be
the
theory
of
the
case
if
it
isn't
an
accident?
on
what
theory
would
the
pleading
asserted?
chief
justice
burger
yes.
you
say
then
the
common
law
claim
would
arise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
