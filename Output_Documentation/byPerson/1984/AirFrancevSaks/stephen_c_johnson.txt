mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
turns
on
the
proper
construction
of
a
treaty.
it
also
involves
important
considerations
of
judicial
restraint
under
our
constitutional
system
in
the
treatymaking
process.
the
treaty
is
the
warsaw
convention,
the
agreement
governing
it
a
national
aviation.
this
court
considered
and
enforce
the
liability
ceilings
under
that
treaty
last
term
in
its
franklin
mint
decision.
we
are
asking
the
court
now
to
consider
and
enforce
prerequisites
for
that
liability
under
the
convention.
as
the
court
has
noted
this
treaty
has
been
in
effect
now
for
over
50
years,
and
has
provided
stable
and
internationally
uniform
rules
governing
international
air
transportation.
there
is,
however,
now
pending
a
balanced
package
of
amendments
to
the
warsaw
convention
which
have
not
yet
been
ratified
by
the
u.s.
senate.
as
the
court
noted
last
term,
those
amendments
remain
on
a...
calendar.
the
majority
below
has
nevertheless
upon
judicial
fiat
enacted
only
one
of
those
amendments
by
removing
a
prerequisite
for
carrier
liability
for
personal
injuries
under
the
treaty
as
it
now
stands.
in
so
doing,
the
majority
has
misinterpreted
the
treaty
and
has
inappropriately
interfered
with
the
treatymaking
powers
of
the
political
branches.
in
this
case
we
ask
the
court
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
article
17
of
the
treaty.
that
article
establishes
as
a
prerequisite
for
carrier
liability
for
passenger
injury
and
death
claims
the
requirement
that
such
injuries
or
death
be
caused
by
an
accident.
that
prerequisite
for
liability
has
been
universally
recognized
by
the
courts.
the
third
circuit
has
properly,
in
our
view,
applied
that
prerequisite
in
its
demarines
decision
by
stating
its
two
basic
elements,
first,
that
there
be
an
accident,
and
second,
that
that
accident
proximately
caused
the
injury.
the
majority
below
has
acknowledged
the
requirement.
however,
in
the
guise
of
treaty
construction,
their
decision
would
effectively
abolish
that
requirement
by
allowing
recovery
where
a
flight
has
been
normal
in
all
respects
and
no
accident
has
occurred
to
cause
the
injury.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--i
think
you
have
to
look
back
into
1929,
in
fact,
and
still
today,
i
think
that
under
concepts
like
bailment
rules
there
are
generally
stricter
standards
of
liability
than
apply
to
the
handling
of
baggage
than
there
are
to
persons.
i
think
when
you
do
look
back
to
the
drafters'
comments
in
1929,
it
becomes
very
clear
that
they
intentionally
chose
those
words,
18
and--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
there
is.
in
fact,
the
president
of
the
drafting
committee,
mr.
gianinni,
spoke
to
the
convention
just
before
the
vote
was
taken
adopting
articles
17,
18,
and
19.
nineteen
establishes
the
basis
for
delayed
claims.
and
in
his
comments
he
stated
that
because
there
was
a
different
case
for
liability
in
each
of
the
three
categories,
that
was
the
reason
they
broke
out
the
three
different
articles,
and
he
specifically
stated,
let
me
quote
to
you,
he
told
the
conference
that
their
committee
"had
deemed
it
would
be
better
to
begin
by
setting
out
the
causes
of
liability
for
persons,
then
for
goods
and
baggage,
and
finally
in
the
case
of
delay.
"
and
that
was
what
was
done
by
dividing
up
the
three
articles
and
stating
the
different
conditions
for
carrier
liability
in
each
of
the
three
situations.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
i
think,
justice
stevens,
yes,
we
probably
do,
but
i
think
first
of
all
you
should
realize
that
in
this
case
i
think
we
are
dealing
with
the
two
extremes,
the
air
catastrophe
and
the
absolutely
normal
flight.
i
don't
think
under
any
interpretation
can
that
be
considered
to
be
an
accident.
i
think
that
the
dissent
below
has
properly
used
the
demarines
standard.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
it's
difficult,
isn't
it,
when
you
get
into
the
middle
area,
and
in
fact
i
think
the
parties
to
the
convention
have
had
difficulty
with
this
themselves.
i
have
some
comments
to
talk
about
these
pending
amendments,
and
even
there,
when
they
are
talking
about
expanding
the
scope
of
carrier
liability
to
include
all
events,
which
is
not
the
current
treaty,
the
treaty
parties
still
hold
back
an
exception
for
any
injuries
due
to
the
internal
state
of
the
health
of
the
passenger.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
i
am
sorry?
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
what
you
have
to
focus
on
is
the
event
outside
of
the
injury
which
causes
it,
and
it
is
that
event
which
should
be
unexpected,
under
the
third
circuit
standard,
and,
i
think,
consistently
with
the
convention.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
if
you
look
at
the
event,
the
two
parts
of
article
17's
requirement,
that
there
be
an
accident
and
that
that
accident
in
turn
caused
the
injury,
then
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
accident,
it
doesn't
make
too
much
difference
from
whose
perspective
you
look
at
it,
it
is
an
unexpected
event.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
i
think
another
way
to
approach
it,
justice
stevens,
is
to
realize
what
the
warsaw
convention
does.
the
convention
itself
is
and
remains
a
fault-based
system,
and
the
standard
under
article
17
for
carrier
liability
set
up
a
duty
by
the
carrier
to
avoid
accidents.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
you
can
easily
see
that
a
carrier
has
a
duty
to
retain
people
that
don't
go
about
the
airplane
spilling
coffee.
also
in
the
air
turbulence
situation,
there
are
regulations
that
require
an
airline
to
take
measures
to
try
to
avoid
air
turbulence.
so
it
is
something
that
certainly
is
within
the
scope
of
things
that
the
airline
should
be
avoiding.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
that's
correct.
what
we're
looking
at
is
the
initial
accident
requirement.
once
you
apply
that
test
and
find
that
an
accident
has
occurred,
then
it
is
like
strict
product
liability.
there
is
no--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--i
think
if
you
go
back
to
the
fundamental
purposes
of
the
convention
itself,
it
would
be
more
likely
to
be
from
the
carrier's
standpoint,
but
i
think
the
primary
focus
is
on
the
event
itself.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
i
am
not
sure
if
the
certified
record
does,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it
may
well
be
stated
by
the
plaintiffs
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
there
were
no
other
complaints,
no
other
problems
on
the
flight.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
sure
they
would
have,
and
in
fact
in
responding
to
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
they
conceded
to
the
court
that
this
flight
had
been
normal
in
all
respects.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
those
cases
are
consistent
with
the
analysis
here.
they
are
certainly
from
the
standpoint
of
the
carrier
unexpected
events
that
do
not
occur,
and
they
certainly--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--yes,
i
think
that
has
been
fairly
well
established
now.
the
husserl
decision
was
the
first
one
to
reach
that
point,
and
it
did
find
some
basis
in
actual
discussions
among
the
treaty
parties
for
finding
that
the
accident
liability
would
extend
to
those
incidents,
which
is
quite
distinct
from
our
situation
here,
you
realize,
where
we
have
a
perfectly
normal
flight,
where
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
history
of
this
convention
that
that
should
fall
within
the
prerequisites
for
liability.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
i
think
there
again
you
can
view
that
in
terms
of
the
duty
of
the
carrier.
it
certainly
is
unexpected
from
the
standpoint
of
the
carrier,
and
i
think
that
the
carrier
does
have
the
duty
to
protect
passengers
from
unexpected
events
like
that,
and
assault
by
another
passenger
would
well,
i
think,
fit
within
the
demarines
definition.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
it
is
a
bit
more
difficult,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
these
are
not
easy
questions.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
yes.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
i
am
not
sure.
i
think
if
it
was
something
entirely
internal
to
the
passenger,
that--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--there
has
been
a
case
along
those
lines
that
suggested
that
ruling.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
i
think
that
that's
correct,
exactly.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
you
have
to
go
back
to
realize
that
you
are
interpreting
a
treaty.
the
treaty
does
set
forth
the
accident
requirement.
and
that
original
requirement
was
based
on
a
fault
concept.
the
carriers
have
a
duty
to
prevent
accidents,
not
all
occurrences.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
not
necessarily.
what
they
bargained
away
was
the
due
care
defense.
in
other
words,
once
you
have
an
accident,
liability
is
presumed.
article
20
gave
a
basis
to
come
back
with
a
due
care
defense
and
say
it
wasn't
the
carrier's
fault
to
avoid
liability,
but
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
realize
that
article
17
was
not
at
all
addressed
to
the
montreal
agreement,
as
pointed
out
by
the
u.s.
government's
brief
to
this
court.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
task
for
this
court
is
simply
to
decide
what
the
accident
requirement
means.
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
very
good
analogy,
i
believe,
to
what
the
majority
below
has
done
here.
it
is
the
strict
product
liability
doctrine,
where
a
manufacturer
is
held
absolutely
liable
for
the
consequences
of
defects
in
their
products.
they
are
not
held
liable
for
all
the
injuries
caused
by
their
products.
so
the
task
as
i
see
it
under
the
warsaw
convention
now
is
to
recognize
that
there
must
be
an
accident
before
the
absolute
liability
doctrine
comes
into
play
under
the
montreal
agreement.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
if
that
happened,
justice
marshall,
i
think
it
would
definitely
be
an
accident.
aircraft
are
not
expected
to
slam
on
their
brakes
and
throw
passengers
out
of
their
seats.
it
is
a
broad
standard
that
the
third
circuit
has
enunciated
to
try
to
effect
the
intention
of
the
parties.
i
think
it
is
important,
though,
to
come
back
to
the
narrow
issue
presented
by
this
case,
and
it
is
whether
the
respondent's
injury
in
this
case
was
caused
by
an
accident
within
the
meaning
of
article
17,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
everyday
normal
conduct
of
an
aircraft,
in
fact
the
necessary
operation
of
an
aircraft
pressurization
system
can
be
the
independent
accident
that
causes
the
injury.
as
the
court
well
knows,
the
beginning
point
in
the
construction
of
a
treaty
is,
of
course,
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself,
which
should
be
construed
to
avoid
rendering
any
word
meaningless.
this
court
has
recognized,
as
it
did
last
term
in
franklin
mint
and
long
ago
in
the
amiable
isabella,
that
the
courts
are
not
at
liberty
to
dispense
with
any
of
the
conditions
or
requirements
of
the
treaty.
if
we
adopted
the
respondent's
view
of
what
the
warsaw
convention
means,
you
could
simply
withdraw
that
phrase
if
the
accident
which
caused,
and
just
go
on
to
say
that
the
damage.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
history
of
this
convention
to
suggest
the
majority
view
below
is
correct,
and
the
decision
below
has
departed
from
these
basic
principles
by
reading
the
word
"accident"
to
mean
any
occurrence
associated
with
the
operation
of
the
aircraft.
carrier
liability
under
article
17
requires
that
the
injury
be
caused
by
an
accident,
not
by
an
occurrence,
and
this
should
be
compared,
justice
o'connor,
with
the
language
in
article
18,
where
the
word
"occurrence"
is
used.
as
i
indicated,
the
convention's
history
and
the
comments
of
the
president
of
the
drafting
committee
to
my
mind
indicate
that
that
was
a
deliberate
choice.
also,
the
parties'
subsequent
construction
of
the
treaty,
which
is
also
ignored
by
the
majority
below,
confirms
that
the
respondent
is
now
asking
this
court
to
amend
article
17
as
it
now
stands.
i
speak
specifically
of
the
proposed
treaty
amendments
adopted
in
the
guatemala
city
protocal
of
1971
and
included
in
the
1985
protocols,
which
as
this
court
recognized
still
await
senate
ratification.
several
proposed
amendments
were
adopted
in
those
two
diplomatic
conferences
which
constitute
a
balanced
package
significantly
increasing
the
carrier's
scope
of
liability,
increasing
the
liability
limits
in
an
exchange
for
more
a
unbreakable
ceiling
on
carrier
liability.
part
of
the
proposed
compromise
specifically
amends
article
17
to
change
the
word
from
"accident"
to
"event".
if
the
amendments
are
adopted,
the
carriers
will
become
liable
for
a
broader
class
of
injuries
not
now
covered
by
the
convention.
the
pending
amendment
to
article
17
reads
exactly
like
what
respondent
is
proposing
this
court
should
have
done.
the
treaty
parties,
however,
have
not
yet
adopted
it.
the
present
treaty
is
limited
to
injuries
caused
by
accidents
and
not
by
normal
events
or
occurrences.
you
mentioned
the
montreal
agreement.
both
the
respondent
and
the
majority
below
assert
that
that
1966
private
agreement
among
international
air
carriers
effectively
removed
the
convention's
act
as
a
prerequisites
for
carrier
liability.
the
u.s.'s
brief
explains,
as
does
the
history,
that
that
agreement
addressed
only
the
due
care
defense
and
in
no
way
affected
the
prerequisites
for
carrier
liability.
the
task
of
this
court
is
to
apply
the
provisions
of
article
17
as
they
now
stand.
the
rewriting
and
renegotiation
of
treaties
are
the
tasks
of
the
political
branches.
you
have
the
amicus
briefs
of
two
of
the
principal
acting
nations
responsible
for
the
warsaw
system.
the
republic
of
france
was
largely
responsible
for
the
creation
of
the
system
in
the
1920's.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
normally
in
all
other
countries
that
are
not
affected
by
the
montreal
agreement,
they
go
immediately
to
the
due
care
defense.
so
there
are
some
decisions
in
france,
but
those
are
the
only
ones
that
we
have
been
able
to
find.
in
addition
to
the
republic
of
france,
you
have
their
amicus
brief,
the
united
states,
as
the
court
well
knows,
has
been
a
most
important
force
in
the
history
of
the
warsaw
system
since
this
country
adhered
to
the
treaty
in
1934.
both
governments
join
the
petitioner--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--your
honor,
i
would
hesitate
to
say.
i
would
certainly
defer
to
the
court's
judgment
in
that.
you
certainly
do
have
the
views
of
the
solicitor
general
which
speak
for
the
government.
and
both
governments
do
join
now
with
the
petitioner
in
asking
you
to
enforce
the
treaty
as
it
now
stands
and
find
that
the
injury
in
this
case
was
not
caused
by
an
aviation
accident.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
short
answer
to
the
question
of
remaining
state
law
claims
is
very
simple.
it
is
on
the
face
of
the
treaty
itself.
there
were
two
purposes
in
that
treaty.
one
was
to
establish
some
limits
for
liability.
the
other
was
to
provide
uniform
rules
governing
international
air
transportation,
as
stated
in
the
preamble
to
the
convention,
and
article
1
states
that
the
treaty
applies
to
all
international
aviation
persons
and
aircraft
for
hire.
article
24
in
the
convention
states
that
all
the
claims
brought
under
that
treaty
shall
be
subject
to
the
conditions
and
terms
of
the
convention.
that
does
make
the
convention
the
exclusive--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
article
17
sets
the
prerequisites
for
injury
liability,
18
for
baggage
liability--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
if
there
was
a
negligence
claim?
if
it
was
not
an
accident?
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
no,
i
am
saying
that
there
would
be...
if
there
was
any
conceivable...
and
i
have
some
problem
conceiving
of
it...
conceivable
other
cause
of
action
or
claim,
it
would
be
subject
to
the
warsaw
requirement
that
there
first
be
an
accident
before
you
have
liability.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
i
am
sorry,
i
misspoke.
if
it
is
an
injury
claim
or
a
death
claim,
it
is
subject
to
article
17's
prerequisite
for
liability,
and
the
second
purpose
of
this
treaty
was
to
establish
uniform
rules.
the
second
circuit
in
its
benjamins
decision
has
recognized
that--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--if
there
is
an
injury--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--yes.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
your
honor,
i
think
you
are
talking
about
the
airline
not
under
the
warsaw
convention--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--because...
that
liability
is
not
established.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
yes,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--no,
it
is
wrong.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
the
liability
limit
applies
to
claims
for
injury
and
death
in
international
air
transportation
under
the
convention.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
most
of
the
cases
that
have
said
there
are
remaining
state
law
claims
apply
to
incidents
that
occurred
outside
the
course
of
the
transportation.
the
convention
doesn't
apply
at
all.
here
we
have
a
case
where
an
injury
occurred
on
board
the
flight.
it
is
dead
center
in
the
convention,
and
the
convention's
own
language
makes
it
clear
that
that
is--
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
--no,
it
is
a
later
article,
i
think,
article
23,
under
the
convention
sets
limits.
mr.
stephen
c.
johnson
well,
in
a
sense
it
wouldn't
apply
because
you
have
to
have
a
direct...
for
liability
first
under
the
convention's
uniform
rules
before
you
begin
to
consider
a
limit
on
liability.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
benjamin
decision
in
the
second
circuit
where
they
address
this
issue
and
also
discuss
the
uniformity
aspect,
looking
to
some
legislation
outside
of
this
country
on
the
exclusivity
question.
thank
you
very
much.
