justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question?
do
you
adopt
judge
wallace's
position
in
dissent?
specifically,
he
says
there
is
an
accident
if
you
are
flying
along
and
you
hit
a
little
rough
air
and
spill
some
coffee,
that
that
would
be
an
accident.
justice
stevens
but
you
would
say
then
that
if
during
a
little
bumpy
air
someone
had
a
heart
attack,
that
that
heart
attack
would
be
covered;
if
it
was
just
heart
attack
because
of
fear
of
landing,
say,
it
would
not
be
covered.
justice
stevens
well,
yes,
i
guess
everyone
agrees
that
the
injury
must
be
caused
by
something
related
to
the
flight.
in
other
words,
if
you
had
a
heart
attack
in
an
airplane
that
you
were
going
to
have
at
home
anyway,
that
would
not
be
covered
even
under
the
ninth
circuit
view,
as
i
read
it.
justice
stevens
i
say,
i
think
both
sides
seem
to
agree
that
there
must
be
something
connected
with
the
flight
that
caused
the
harm,
so
that
if
you
had
a
heart
attack
in
flight
that
you
would
have
had
at
home
anyway,
that
would
not
be
covered
even
under
the
ninth
circuit
view,
as
i
read
it.
justice
stevens
but
if
you
adopt
judge
wallace's
view,
how
do
you
know
whether
something
is
unexpected?
is
it
unexpected
to
the
passenger
or
unexpected
to
the
seasoned
flier?
i
am
still...
i
am
not
sure
your
line
is
bright
and
clear.
justice
stevens
but
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
passenger's
point
of
view,
you
might
have
a
new
passenger
who
didn't
expect
a
dramatic
change
in
air
pressure
within
the
cabin.
it
may
well
be
unexpected
that
the
passenger
is
going
to
have
a
problem
with
hearing.
justice
stevens
then
you
are
departing
from
the
spilling
of
coffee
example
of
judge
wallace.
justice
stevens
if
i
understood
judge
wallace,
his
example
of
burning
oneself
in
air
turbulence
didn't
depend
at
all
on
any
fault
by
the
airline.
justice
stevens
my
question
is,
how
do
you
know
when
it
occurred
under
your
view?
you
use
the
language
"unexpected",
and
i
ask,
to
whom
must
it
be
unexpected,
the
passenger
or
the
pilot.
justice
stevens
well,
i
am
not
saying
you
would
have
to,
but
then
i
think
your
position
is
different
from
judge
wallace's.
that
is
all
i
am
suggesting.
does
the
record
show
here
whether
any
other
passengers
suffered
any
ear
problems?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the...
of
course,
the
united
states
isn't
speaking
to
us,
but
their
brief,
they
describe
letter
that
they
got
from
different
departments
of
the
government.
do
you
think
it
is
proper
for
us
to
rely
on
that
extra
record
material?
justice
stevens
weather
is
always
unpredictable.
justice
stevens
and
which
was
improperly--
--just
say
sudden
turbulence,
severe
turbulence,
unexpected.
justice
stevens
and
heart
attack
or
swallow
food
or
something.
is
that
covered
or
not?
justice
stevens
but
i
am
asking
under
your
view
if
it
were
proven
or
stipulated
that
some
harm
resulted
to
a
passenger
as
a
result
of
turbulence
in
flight
that
might
well
have
been
predicted,
but
just
very
rough
there.
justice
stevens
no,
let's
make
it
a
proven
that
he
swallowed
his
food
and
some
injury,
something...
the
causal
connection
is
strictly
caused
by
unexpected
turbulence
in
flight.
justice
stevens
no,
no
mechanical...
it
is
a
very
simple
case,
very
simple
case.
the
pilot
is
expecting
turbulence.
the
passengers
don't
know
how
rough
it
is
going
to
be.
it
is
much
rougher
than
they
expect,
and
as
a
result
of
the
turbulence,
spill
coffee,
have
heart
attack,
bump
head,
anything,
but
any
of
those,
are
they
accidents
or
not?
justice
stevens
under
your
view
they
are
not.
justice
stevens
may
i
see
if
i
understand
your
argument,
which
i
frankly
hadn't
entirely
before?
what
you
are
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
if
the
normal
operation
of
an
aircraft
in
a
few
seconds
is
to
change
cabin
pressure
by
increasing
it
from...
the
equivalent
of
6,000
feet
change
in
altitude
immediately,
that
is
normal,
and
if
that
frequently
and
repeatedly
caused
hearing
loss
to
passengers,
normally
did
so,
you
might
say
that
is
not
an
accident
under
their
definition.
it
is
nevertheless
negligence
to
continue
to
do
this,
and
you
have
a
common
law
remedy.
justice
stevens
that
is
your
theory.
justice
stevens
so
if
it
is
not
an
accident
it
is
just
outside
of
the
treaty
entirely.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
if
under
normal
operation...
i
am
just
not
quite
clear.
do
they
mean
by
the
particular
airline
or
by
the
airline
industry?
in
other
words,
i
could
imagine
that
pressure
changes
could
differ
from
airline
to
airline.
and
plane
to
plane.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
i
want
to
be
sure,
there
is
quite
a
wide
difference
of
opinion
between
you
and
your
opponent
on
the
fundamental
of
the
treaty.
assume
you
are
right,
that
this
is
not
an
accident
because
it
is
the
normal
operation
of
the
aircraft,
and
you
are
therefore
not
within
article
17.
are
you
saying
that
even
though
this
happened
to
thousands
of
people
in
normal
operation,
it
could
therefore
be
proved
to
be
negligence,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
it
could,
but
this
i
am
on
a
hypothetical,
that
they
would
not
then
be
able
to
sue
you
in
negligence
for
saying
that
you
normally
operate
your
aircraft
in
a
negligent
way
even
though
there
are
no
accidents
caused
by
it?
couldn't
they
sue
you
at
common
law?
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
his
theory
is,
if
you
get
outside
of
accidents,
you
also
get
outside
of
the
liability
limitation.
justice
stevens
that
is
correct,
is
it
not?
justice
stevens
so
the
liability
limitation
applies
even
if
there
is
no
accident,
is
your
view.
justice
stevens
other
than
article
17,
something
other
than
article
17?
justice
stevens
is
a
liable
limitation
found
in
article
17?
justice
stevens
and
that
applies
even
though
the
incident
is
not
one
described
in
article
17?
