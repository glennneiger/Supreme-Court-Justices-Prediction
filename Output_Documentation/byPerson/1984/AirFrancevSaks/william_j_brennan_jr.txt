justice
jr.
mr.
cohen,
do
i
understand...
suppose
this
were
an
accident.
would
your
client
nevertheless
have
had
the
option
to
sue
in
state
court?
justice
jr.
what
i
am
trying
to
get
to
is,
as
i
understood
your
colloquy
with
justices
o'connor
and
stevens
earlier,
you
said
that
if
this
is
not
an
accident,
then
your
client
may
be
relegated
to
a
state
court
suit--
justice
jr.
--with
a
possible...
common
law.
justice
jr.
with
a
possible
recovery
in
six
or
eight
figures.
justice
jr.
i
can't
understand
if
that
is
available
to
you
why
you
would
want
to
press
a
warsaw
convention
suit
where
you
are
limited
to
$75,000.
justice
jr.
now,
if
it
is
an
accident,
what
is
there
about
the
warsaw
convention
that
bars
your
suing
in
state
court
under
common
law?
the
limitation.
justice
jr.
what
of
the
case
where
it
is
not
an
accident?
does
that
preclude
the
common
law
suit?
justice
jr.
i
know,
but
there
isn't
any.
then
what
happens
to
common--
--suppose
there
is
no
accident.
then
you
say
that
it
is
as
though
the
treaty
hadn't
been
adopted.
you
just
sue
the
airlines
in
a
garden
variety
negligence
suit.
