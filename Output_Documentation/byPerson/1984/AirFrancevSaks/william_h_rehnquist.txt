justice
rehnquist
well,
you
refer
in
several
of
your
comments
to
the
carrier's
duty,
and
then
you
refer
in
many
of
your
comments,
and
of
course
your
position
here
is
that
an
accident
is
required.
how
do
those
two
intermesh?
justice
rehnquist
then
in
the
montreal
convention
they
in
effect
bargained
away
the
fault.
justice
rehnquist
but
once
you
have
this
unexpected
occurrence,
the
carrier
can't
defend
by
saying
we
could
not
have
prevented
that
occurrence
by
any
sort
of
care.
justice
rehnquist
the
entebbe
case
involved
people
who
weren't
parties
to
the
montreal
convention...
the
montreal
agreement.
is
that
right?
justice
rehnquist
why
was
the
due
care
defense
available
if
the
carrier
was
of
a
nation
who
was
a
party
to
the
montreal--
justice
rehnquist
well,
to
pose
a
more
extreme
example,
i
suppose
if
the
pilot
announces
that
all
the
engines
are
gone,
we
are
going
to
crash
in
two
minutes,
the
fact
that
you
then
crash
does
not
make
it
not
an
accident
just
because
you
expected
it
for
the
last
two
minutes.
justice
rehnquist
but
how
does
that
incorporate
the
word
"accident"?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
just
gave
two
tests,
i
guess,
for
imposing
liability,
neither
of
which
seem
to
me
to
deal
at
all
with
the
word
"accident"
which
you
find
in
the
language
of
the
convention.
justice
rehnquist
why
did
they
use
two
different
words
then?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
you
agree
that
accident
and
occurrence
mean
two
different
things
in
the
convention.
justice
rehnquist
that
is
because
the
word
"occurrence"
is
a
good
deal
broader
than
the
word
"accident".
that
doesn't
shock
me,
your
example.
justice
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
if
something
is
not
an
accident
within
the
meaning
of
the
convention
that
we
are
talking
about,
then
one
can
sue
the
carrier
under
state
common
law?
justice
rehnquist
does
that
make
any
sense
to
you?
i
mean,
the
air
carriers
got
absolutely
nothing
then
by
this
convention,
if
you
are
right,
because
every
time
the
convention
gives
them
a
beneficial
interpretation,
the
plaintiff
says,
well,
it
is
outside
the
convention
so
we
sue
at
common
law.
does
that
make
sense
to
you?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
the
warsaw
convention
is
modified
by
the
montreal
agreement,
says
an
airline
is
to
be
liable
to
a
passenger
in
a
case
of
accident,
and
this
is
not
an
accident,
then
you
have
to
ask
yourself,
was
this
meant
to
be
the
exclusive
liability
for
international
carriers,
and
i
dare
say
a
lot
of
airlines
probably
thought
it
was.
i
mean,
the
fact
that
one
particular
person
can't
recover
for
some
kind
of
peculiar
situation
isn't
a
denial
of
justice
across
the
board.
