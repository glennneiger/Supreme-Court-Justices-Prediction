mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
is
whether
a
total
hearing
loss
suffered
by
an
airline
passenger
through
no
fault
of
her
own
is
a
compensable
injury
under
the
warsaw
convention
as
modified
by
the
montreal
agreement
where
her
hearing
loss
was
proximately
caused
by
the
operation
of
the
aircraft,
and
was
a
risk
inherent
in
and
peculiar
to
air
travel.
i
would
like
to
make
three
factual
points
at
the
outset.
number
one,
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
and
return
this
case
to
trial,
a
one-day
court
trial
would
consist
in
part
of
the
testimony
of
a
board
certified
ear,
nose,
and
throat
specialist
who
would
testify
to
a
reasonable
medical
certainty
that
but
for
those
pressure
changes
in
that
aircraft,
the
microhemorrhaging
and
consequent
hearing
loss
in
ms.
saks
would
not
have
occurred,
and
that
this
hearing
loss
closely
resembles
other
hearing
losses
he
has
treated
due
to
pressure
changes
in
aircraft.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
none
that
we
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--yes,
your
honor,
if
she
is
the
one
out
of
200,
yes,
and
i
think
to
answer
the
court's
question,
we
should
look
to
the
intent
of
the
original
framers
and
as
the
republic
of
france
stresses,
we
should
look
at
the
intent
of
the
framers
in
light
of
the
conditions
and
circumstances
which
existed
at
the
time
the
treaty
was
drafted.
if
we
could
imagine
ourselves
back
in
1929,
when
aviation
was
admittedly
and
according
to
a
cap
memo
we
cited
an
extremely
risky
mode
of
transportation,
and
imagine
ourselves
at
an
airport
where
we
are
watching
passengers
embark
and
disembark
onto
prop
planes
which
today
would
be
museum
pieces,
and
say
on
day
one,
because
of
the
normal
routine
spinning
of
the
prop,
a
boarding
passenger
has
a
piece
of
glass
or
a
particle
or
something
flung
into
his
eye,
causing
blindness.
the
next
week,
a
passenger
is
boarding,
and
due
to
the
normal,
routine
noise
made
by
the
prop
on
the
plane
he
is
boarding
or
one
nearby,
he
suffers
a
total
hearing
loss.
the
next
week,
we
are
on
the
plane
itself,
and
due
to
the
normal,
routine
noise
inside
this
insulated
passenger
cabin,
another
passenger
suffers
a
hearing
loss.
wouldn't
the
original
framers
have
intended,
and
their
primary
purpose
was
to
protect
these
fledgling
airlines
with
a
liability
ceiling,
wouldn't
they
have
intended
to
have
this
ceiling
protect
these
airlines
from
potentially
ruinous
liability
to
allow
these
airlines
to
not
only
have
their
operating
costs,
but
to
channel
money
into
research
and
development
to
correct
these
types
of
deficiencies,
or,
as
petitioner
suggests,
would
the
framers
have
intended
that
these
injuries,
that
the
airlines
be
exposed
to
unlimited
exposure.
if
we
imagined
back
in
1929
that
at
year's
end
there
are
not
just
these
three
people
but
a
half-dozen
more
or
30
more
lined
up
at
the
county
clerk's
office,
complaint
in
hand,
alleging
$50,
000
each
in
provable
damages,
surely
the
original
framers
would
have
wanted
these
fledgling,
financially
insecure
airlines
protected
in
those
situations.
now,
justice
stevens
raised
an
important
point
with
regard
to
air
turbulence,
because
the
entire
thrust
and
common
thread
throughout
the
cases
dealing
with
the
warsaw
convention
is
the
interest
to
protect
both
the
airline
and
the
passenger
from
risks
inherent
in
air
travel.
the
petitioner
stresses
that
the
common
thread
is
really
a
sudden,
unexpected
occurrence,
but
let's
look
at
air
turbulence.
when
you
board
the
plane,
the
pilot
says
to
you,
fasten
your
seat
belt
and
keep
it
fastened
when
you
are
seated.
the
pilot
may
thereafter
come
on
the
intercom
and
say,
we
can
expect
to
experience
turbulence
at
this
time,
over
this
state,
and
it
is
going
to
be
this
rough.
yet
no
court
has
questioned
the
right
of
the
passenger
to
recover
in
that
situation
where
due
to
the
totally
anticipated
usual
and
expected
turbulence
he
suffers
some
kind
of
injury.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
correct,
your
honor,
that
would
certainly
be
an
accident
under
the
third
circuit's
formulation
or
under
the
formulation
we
are
urging,
which
is
an
injury
proximately
caused
by
the
operation
of
the
aircraft
and
risk
inherent
in
flight.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
well,
long
ago,
your
honor,
the
word
"accident"...
i
guess
i
am
not
understanding
the
court's
question.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
that
is
because,
your
honor,
the
original
framers
intended
either
the
word
"accident"
or
"occurrence"
to
be
comprehensive
words,
as
comprehensive
as
possible.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
there
is
a
good
reason
for
that.
number
one,
in
the
preliminary
draft
of
the
treaty,
there
was
no...
they
weren't
distinguished.
they
were
all
listed
under
the
same
article.
however,
as
daniel
goodhice,
who
will
be
cited
in
our
brief,
who
was
a
highly
respected
aviation
expert
back
in
the
thirties,
states,
the
word
"accident"
was
used
because
the
airlines
should
not
be
responsible
for
intentional
wrongdoing
by
passengers.
in
other
words,
if
one
passenger
stood
up
and
decided
to
strike
a
fellow
passenger,
that
is
not
something
for
which
the
airline
should
be
responsible.
the
term
"occurrence"
was
meant
to
cover,
since
the
baggage
was
totally
in
the
custody
and
control
of
the
airline,
it
was
meant
to
cover
such
things
as
theft
or
perishable
goods
going
bad,
which
would
not
necessarily
be
accidents.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
they
mean...
the
distinctions
are
slight,
your
honor,
and
let
me
give
you
one
example
why
we
should
not
make
much
of
that
distinction.
if
on
an
airline
you
have
in
the
baggage
compartment
a
dog
with
his
owner
traveling
above,
and
due
to
the
normal,
routine
pressure
changes
or
noise
levels
in
this
airplane
both
suffer
hearing
losses,
under
petitioner's
view,
the
dog,
or
i
should
say
the
owner
of
the
dog
can
recover
for
the
hearing
loss
of
the
dog,
while
he
himself
is
foreclosed.
the
dog
is
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
liability
to
which
the
owner
is
not.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
well,
if
we
look
at
both
what
mr.
goodhice
says
and
also
what
a
1949
icao
convention,
a
committee
which
met
to
consider
revisions
of
the
warsaw
convention,
they
reiterated,
and
this
is
cited
by
air
france
and,
i
believe,
the
u.s.
government,
they
reiterated
mr.
goodhice's
explanation
that
the
word
"accident"
was
used
to
ensure
that
the
airlines
were
not
held
responsible
for
an
irate
passenger
giving
another
passenger
a
black
eye,
because
that
is
not
a
risk
inherent
in
air
travel.
however--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--no,
your
honor.
with
the
advent
of
international
terrorism,
and
that
is
the
context
in
which
the
guatemala
convention
met
and
urged
that
the
word
"event"
be
substituted
for
the
word
"accident",
people
were
beginning
to
realize
that
the
airlines
could
be
subject
to
ruinous
exposure
due
to
these
terrorist
attacks.
also--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
i
don't
agree
that
that
is
the
ramification
of
the
position
we
are
advocating.
number
one...
there
are
two
reasons
for
it...
the
montreal
agreements
deprive
the
airlines
of
all
due
care
defenses.
number
two,
the
cases
dealing
with
terrorism,
such
as
the
day
case
and
the
evangelino
case,
all
state
that
terrorism
should
come
within
the
definition
of
accident
because
now
in
the
present
day
world
they
are
risks
inherent
in
air
travel.
and
that
is
what
i
meant
originally
when
i
said
the
common
thread
throughout
these
cases
was
not
something
sudden,
unexpected,
and
unusual,
but
rather
risks
inherent
in
air
travel.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
how
many--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--and
nobody
made
any
claims?
we
have
been
unable
to
find
that.
however,
your
honor,
during
world
war
two,
and
this
is
well
substantiated
by
a
cite
in...
it
is
either
demarines
or
warshaw,
the
primary
occupational
hazard
for
pilots
was
temporary
deafness
due
to
the
same
types
of
pressure
changes.
there
may
be,
and
i
can't
say
for
sure,
plenty
of
claimants
out
there
who
suffer
problems
who
never...
redress.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
your
honor,
you
would
be--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--i
feel
hesitant
giving
legal
advice
to
the
court.
0
[generallaughter.]
however,
your
honor,
if
you
did
suffer
a
hearing
loss
due
to
the
pressure
changes
in
the
plane
proximately
caused
by
the
plane
and
the
type
of
injury
that
is
intimately
associated
with
the
operation
of
airlines,
yes,
you
would
be
entitled
to
compensation,
we
feel,
in
conformity
with
the
intent
of
the
original
drafters.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
yes,
your
honor,
it's
an
accident--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--probably,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
he
has
a
case
either
under
the
third
circuit's
formulation
or
under
the
formulation
we
urge
today.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
yes.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
no,
but
it
was
a
747,
and
i
think
we
could
safely
assume
it
was
several
hundred.
we
don't
know
exactly
how
many.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
that
is
one
of
the
definitions,
your
honor.
there
are
many
definitions
of
accident,
some
which
may
support
petitioner.
many
of
them
support
us.
and
the
interchangeability
of
the
word
"accident"
and
"occurrence"
cannot
be
denied.
for
example,
if
your
honor
were
to
go
home
tonight
and
look
at
his
own
accident
insurance
policy,
and
look
at
his
coverage,
he
would
probably
see--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--under
the
present
system,
it
would
not,
because
willful
misconduct
gets
you
around
the
liability
limits.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
the
willful
misconduct
exception
applies
only
to
acts
by
agents
or
employees
of
the
airline.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
yes,
it
is
now,
and
that
raises
an
important
point.
the
senate
bill,
the
bill
currently
before
the
senate
to
which
i
believe
both
air
france
and
republic
of
france
cited,
would
substitute
the
word
6,
produced
the
result
respondent
seeks.
if
it
would
produce
the
result
respondent
seeks,
then
it
would
necessarily
work
a
radical
departure
from
the
present
scheme
and
bring
with
it
the
parade
of
horribles
they
say
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
causes.
and
i
ask
the
court
why,
then,
would
president
gerald
ford,
a
conservative
republican,
president
jimmy
carter,
and
president
ronald
reagan
all
give
their
full
support
to
such
a
system
which
would
open
the
floodgates
and
cause
all
these
problems?
additionally,
in
the
letter
of
transmittal
cited
by
the
united
states
and
the
senate
hearings
and
the
report
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee,
there
is
absolutely
no
mention
of
any
intent
to
change
the
scope,
the
meaning,
or
do
any
type
of
historic
reform
of
article
17,
the
accident
causing
injury.
rather,
and
the
most
sensible
interpretation
is
that
the
change
in
language
was
rather
intended
to
better
express
what
the
warsaw
drafters
originally
intended.
there
are
consequences
of
finding
this
case
not
to
be
under
the
warsaw
system,
which
i
think
are
worth
discussing
in
the
few
minutes
left.
as
the
cases
uniformly
state,
if
this
case
does
not
come
within
the
warsaw
system,
this
or
ones
like
it,
then
it
is
back
under
common
law
negligence,
and
duty
of
the
common
carriers
we
know
since
the
late
1800's
has
been
that
of
the
utmost
care
and
diligence.
again,
let's
imagine
we
are
back
in
1929,
and
these
types
of
incidences
are
not
covered
by
the
warsaw
convention.
we
have
a
skillful
plaintiff's
attorney
who
goes
into
court,
and
blessed
by
a
jury
instruction
of
the
utmost
care
and
diligence,
obtains
a
jury
verdict
of
$100,000
or
more,
well
in
excess
of
the
carrier's
ability
to
pay.
there
we
have
a
situation
where
the
principal
purpose
of
the
warsaw
convention,
which
was
to
invoke
a
liability
shield
or
ceiling
for
the
airline,
is
totally
defeated.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
that
is
what
the
abramson
case
says,
the
husserl
case,
and
all
the
other
cases
we
have
cited
towards
the
end
of
the
brief,
and
it
is
not
subject
to
serious
dispute,
though
petitioner
attempts
to
distinguish
those
cases.
article
24
of
the
convention
says
for
cases
covered
by
article
17,
the
limitations
and
conditions
apply,
meaning
the
liability
ceiling.
the
courts
have
clearly
said
in
the
abramson
case,
and
the
third
circuit
said
it
in
1984,
that
if
article
17
doesn't
apply,
in
other
words,
if
there
is
no
accident,
you
are
allowed--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--not,
your
honor,
respectfully,
not
as
phrased.
we
are
asking
for
a
broader
interpretation
which
would
allow
the
airlines
to
have
a
liability
ceiling
applied
to
more
situations.
the
consequences
of
not
allowing
a
plaintiff
to
sue
at
common
law,
assuming
grievous
negligence
on
the
airline,
would
be
to
in
effect
insulate
the
airline,
provide
him
an
immunity
for
what
could
be
routine
negligence.
for
example,
take
the
abramson
case,
facts
where
the
man
got
on
the
plane
with
a
hernea
condition,
and
he
told
the
stewardess
that
he
needed
to
lie
down.
knowing,
aware
of
his
problems,
having
the
ability
to
correct
the
problem,
she
nevertheless
declined
to
do
so.
and
she
may
have
violated
twa
or
whatever
it
was
express
policy.
there
was
a
wrong.
if
he
is
not
allowed...
and
the
court
clearly
held
it
was
not
an
accident
and
not
an
accident
in
part
because
it
was
not...
that
type
of
injury
was
not
a
risk
inherent
in
flight,
and
therefore
not
an
accident.
if
there
is
no
remedy,
then
mr.
abramson
has
no
chance
of
recovery--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--i
think
the
court
is
correct
that
originally
the...
and
that
was
my
argument
at
the
outset
when
i
cited
those
examples
from
1929
with
the
ear
injuries
due
to
the
normal
rotation
of
the
prop,
the
airlines
and
the
countries
probably
wanted
this
to
be
extremely
comprehensive,
indeed,
the
sole
exclusive
remedy.
however,
if
we
are
allowed
to
interpret
the
word
"accident"
narrowly
as
petitioner
contends,
then
the
inevitable
effect
under
all
the
cases
will
be,
we
will
be
back
in
state
law
court
with
unlimited
exposure
and
seven-figure
verdicts
against
the
airlines.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
does
what--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
this
court--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--no,
no,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
urge
that
this
court
adopt
the
formulation
i
expressed
in
the
issue
presented,
which--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--i
believe
that
it
would...
rather
state
it
this
way,
that
it
would
not
be
achieving
the
intent
of
the
framers
in
light
of
the
conditions
and
circumstances
in
which
the
treaty
was
drafted.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
it
may
very
well
be
negligence,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
yes,
and
if
this
case
were
returned--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--absolutely,
and
if
this
case
were
returned
to
trial
to
the
district
court
and
not
under
the
warsaw
convention,
what
we
would
have
to
embark
upon
as
any
plaintiff
would
would
be
a
massive
discovery
program
to
the
faa,
the
ntsb
to
see
whether
there
has
in
fact
been
a
trade-off
between
cost
and
safety.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
yes,
that
is
correct,
and
petitioner's
argument
would
have
the
following
effect
if
you
assumed
you
had
a
new
airline
which
had
a
much
better
pressure
system
than
air
france's,
and
air
france
continued
to
fly
its
own
planes.
the
pressure
system
in
this
new
airline
malfunctioned
so
as
to
achieve
the
same
type
of
pressure
changes
in
air
france's
747.
the
incongruous
situation
would
be
that
you
could
recover
against
this
superior
airline
that
had
the
slight
malfunction
so
as
to
function
like
the
air
france
plane,
yet
air
france
would
be
immunized
or
would
be
not
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
well,
the
complaint
was
filed
in
the
state
court
and
quickly
removed
to
federal
court,
and
all
parties
agreed
that
the
warsaw
convention
applied.
no,
we
would
not,
your
honor,
have
the
right
to...
we
could
file
in
state
court
under
the
warsaw
convention
if
it
were
not
against
a
foreign
airliner.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
i
really
mean
common
law.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
yes.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
or
more.
well,
not
for
this
case
necessarily,
but--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--if
this
case
were
a
case
of
total
deafness
in
both
ears,
like
the
rest...
but
the
plaintiff
part
does
not
support
us
in
our
position
here
because
they
want
accident
construed
as
narrowly
as
possible
to
allow
them
to
get
those
large
verdicts.
however,
in
a
case
such
as
this,
with
the
hearing
loss
in
one
ear,
the
damages
are
not
that
high.
the
discovery
involved
in
this
case
alone
to
prove
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
airline
in
using
this
type
of
pressure
system
or
not
improving
it
would
be
$30,000,
$50,000
by
the
time
we
recovered,
all
our
costs
would
eat
up
the
recovery.
so
under
this
case
as
practical
matter,
the
warsaw
convention
will
not
only
save
everybody
money,
but
it
would
mean
that
the
court,
the
district
court
would--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--article
24
specifically.
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
then
i
misspoke,
your
honor.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
these
types
of
injuries
should
come
under
the
warsaw
convention,
so
they
will
be
necessarily
subject
to
the
$8,300
limit.
however,
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
all
these
hypotheticals
i
have
postulated
are
not
accidents,
then
we
are
totally
outside
the
warsaw
convention.
the
liability
ceiling
does
not
apply,
and
the
airlines
are
exposed
to--
mr.
bennett
m.
cohen
--yes.
if
it
is
not
an
accident,
it
is
as
if
it
had
never
been
adopted.
and
i
may
have
a
minute
left,
your
honor,
and
i
wish
to
make
a
couple
of
comments
with
regard
to
the
uniformity
issue
raised
by
the
republic
of
france.
there
are
values
higher
than
uniformity.
it
is
better
for
this
court
to
be
out
of
step
with
the
republic
of
france
and
right
than
to
be
in
step
with
the
republic
of
france
and
wrong.
years
ago
segregation
was
the
uniform
law
of
the
land,
and
that
was
changed
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
uniform
because
our
value
system
said
it
was
wrong.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
change
the
warsaw
convention
or
make
a
modification
in
it.
rather,
you
are
asking
the
court
to
recognize
the
original
intent
of
the
framers
in
an
attempt
to
achieve
its
underlying
purpose
as
conceived
in
1929.
thank
you.
