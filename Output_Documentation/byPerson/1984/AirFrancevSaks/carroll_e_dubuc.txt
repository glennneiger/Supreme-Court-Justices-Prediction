mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
behalf
of
the
republic
of
france,
as
indicated
by
mr.
johnson,
one
of
the
principal
signatories
and
one
of
the
initiators
of
the
original
warsaw
convention,
we
rise
to
emphasize
to
the
court
on
behalf
of
france
and
other
countries
of
western
europe
as
well
as
throughout
the
world
the
extreme
importance
to
these
nations
of
the
continued
enforceability,
reliability,
predictability,
and
uniformity
of
result
with
respect
to
dealing
with
matters
arising
under
this
treaty
until
such
time
as
the
signatories
and
the
parties
have
come
to
a
mutual
agreement
to
modify
it
as
might
be
necessary
if
desirable.
there
have
been
questions
from
the
court
today
concerning
a
number
of
hypothetical
situations
and
also
a
question
of
how
other
countries
would
have
decided
this
issue.
the
haddad
case
is
cited
in
our
brief
in
two
or
three
opinions.
there
is
an
air
intere
case
in
france
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
there
is
also
some
commentary
as
to
a
polish
case
by
razinsky,
a
commentary
by
the
societe
du
francaise
arien
in
france,
the
french
legal
society.
the
thrust
of
those
decisions
is
that
an
accident
must
be
unpredictable
and
sudden
in
some
aspects.
they
have
accepted
to
some
extent
the
hijacking
circumstance.
haddad
was
in
fact
a
case
arising
out
of
the
infamous
entebbe
hijacking,
and
the
liability
in
that
case,
as
mr.
johnson
mentioned,
went
off
on
the
issue
of
article
20,
sub
1,
which
provides
the
due
care
defense.
but
the
term
17.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
oh,
no,
justice
rehnquist.
the
entebbe
case
involved
parties...
air
france
was
the
carrier.
there
were
two
or
three
montreal
tickets
which
had
been
issued
and
delivered
in
the
united
states,
and
for
the
most
part
the
rest
of
the
tickets
had
no
stopping
place
or
destination
place
or
destination
here.
the
issue
didn't
come
up
because
there
were
some
cases
settled
on
behalf
of
the
americans.
the
israeli
cases
were
settled,
and
a
large
number
of
cases
went
off
to
decision.
lawsuits
were
brought
here
in
the
united
states,
and
as
to
the
carrier
dismissed
under
article
28,
because
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
the
lawsuit
here.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
it
was
not
available
in
the
cases
which
were
brought
in
france,
so
it
did
not
come
up,
but
the
issue
of
whether
accident
qua
accident
encompasses
a
hijacking
as
opposed
to
the
coffee
spill,
as
opposed
to
the
heart
attack
which
was
preexisting
and
long
existing,
as
opposed
to
the
problem
with
the
fingernail,
as
opposed
to
phlebitis
for
example,
or
as
opposed
to
mr.
abramsom's
hiatal
hernea,
which
was
preexisting,
these
consistently
would
not
be
included
in
the
term
"accident"
in
other
countries.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
i
think,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
and
submit
that
on
behalf
of
the
government
of
france
and
other
governments,
the
definition
of
accident
would
be
something
akin
to
the
sudden,
unpredictable
mechanical
failure
or
external
means,
external--
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
--yes,
because
the--
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
--with
either
mechanical
failure,
human
failure.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
unpredictable
weather
which
was
not
anticipated--
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
--you
are
correct.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
sudden
turbulence,
yes.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
i
don't
think
heart
attack
would
be.
there
is
a
case
which
we...
of
course,
we
did
not
submit
a
reply
amicus
brief,
but
i
submit
to
the
court
the
case
of
dalman
against
pan
american
world
airways,
249
f
2nd
493,
a
heart
attack
case
which
occurred
after
the
flight
from...
alleged
fright
during
the
flight
and
there
was
no
recovery.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
and
provided
the
passenger
was
injured,
i
would
assume
the
passenger
probably
failed
to
fasten
his
seatbelt
when
requested
to
do
so,
and
if
that
was
the
case
we
go
on
to
another
regime.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
i
think
if
it
is
proximately
caused
by
an
unforeseen
outside
force
or
mechanical
defect
or
failure
to--
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
--no,
i
would
say
that
is
not
an
accident.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
i
think
that
would
be
the
view
that
we
support,
at
least
that
we
represent
before
the
court.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
i
believe--
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
--yes,
there
would
be.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
i
am
sure
there
would
be,
i
am
sure,
and
there
are
plaintiff's
theories,
and
the
plaintiff
is
very
imaginative
where
they
would
come
up
with
a
theory
of
recovery
on
that,
and
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
jury
and
the
proof
balanced
out
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
they
might
well
recover.
i
think
we
are
making
a
very
simple
example
of
a
complex
case
of
proximate
case,
and
proximate
cause
is
a
factor
in
this
recovery--
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
--ms.
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
we
already
are
seeing,
this
court
is
seeing
a
number
of
cases
in
the
last
couple
of
years
dealing
with
interpretations
of
this
treaty
which
is
under
revision
and
which
is
spawning
a
lot
of
litigation
to
interpret
some
esoteric
terms
that
have
existed
for
40
or
50
years
and
have
been
interpreted
that
way
worldwide.
the
uniformity
of
this
interpretation
is
important.
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
very
important.
the
fact
that
we
are
getting
lots
of
challenges
at
this
point
is
spawning
litigation,
because
not
only
in
the
area
of
personal
injury
or
death,
but
in
the
area
of
commercial
matters,
baggage,
cargo,
this
is
a
commercial
code,
so
to
speak,
a
partial
uniform
commercial
code
worldwide
for
aviation
matters.
and
when
we
disturb
the
balance,
when
we
disturb
the
balance
of
interpretation,
particularly
in
a
treaty
which
is
under
dynamic
reconsideration
by
120
parties,
i
believe
we
are
creating
litigation.
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
ms.
justice
o'connor,
the
prompt
resolution
of
claims
anticipated
by
the
montreal
agreement
was
part
of
a
quid
pro
quo
which
came
as
a
result
of
the
united
states
denunciation
of
the
entire
warsaw
treaty
in
1966.
there
was
a
balance
and
a
quid
pro
quo
between
the
other
signatories
in
the
united
states
to
do
two
things
only,
only
two
things.
one
was
to
increase
the
limitation
as
an
interim
measure
while
this
negotiation
in
tokyo,
guatemala
city,
mexico
city,
and
paris
went
on
driving
toward
a
potential
amendment.
the
second
was
to
eliminate
the
defense
of
due
care,
but
not
to
make
an
absolute
liability.
even
absolute
liability
has
a
proximate
cause
inferring
an
accident
as
an
element.
even
in
california.
even
in
the
ninth
circuit.
to
make
this
an
absolute,
the
interpretations
of
commentators
are
not
the
interpretations
of
signatories.
we
submit
to
change
a
treaty
definition
or
intent,
you
have
to
have
the
signatories
agree.
the
united
states
agrees
that
it
requires
an
accident.
france
agrees
it
requires
an
accident.
most
of
the
120
signatories,
virtually
all
of
them,
although
we
haven't
polled
them
all,
but
we
certainly
haven't
seen
any
opposition,
agree
with
that
accident
interpretation.
so,
the
montreal
agreement
is
still
interpreted
to
require
an
accident
with
a
presumption
of
responsibility,
but
not
automatic
liability.
i
suppose
the
plaintiff's--
mr.
carroll
e.
dubuc
--i
am
sorry.
i
was
just
answering...
are
there
any
other
questions?
