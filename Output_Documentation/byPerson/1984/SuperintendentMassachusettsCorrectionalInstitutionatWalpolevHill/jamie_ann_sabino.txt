ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out,
what
all
parties
agree
with
in
this
case;
that
in
massachusetts
persons
incarcerated
do
have
a
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest
in
their
good
time
credits.
and
all
parties
seem
to
agree
that
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
denial
of
the
liberty
interest
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
it
is
our
contention
and
we
believe
the
contention
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
that
a
decision
which
is
not
based
on
some
evidence
is
that
violation
of
due
process,
it
is
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
violation.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
excuse
me?
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
oh,
i
would
disagree,
your
honor.
i
would
say
there
are
decisions
of
this
court--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--that
indicate...
i
refer
the
court
specifically
to
some
of
the
immigration
decisions
such
as--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--no,
your
honor.
there
has
not
been
a
holding
in
the
context
of
prison
disciplinary
hearings.
however,
this
court
has
held
in
many
cases
that
a
denial
of
the
liberty
interest
on
charges
that
are
unsupported
by
evidence
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
that
was
in
a
deportation
case,
your
honor,
united
states--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--ex
rel
vajtauer.
to
some
extent,
it's
a
different
type
of
denial
of
liberty
interest,
but
in
fact
it
is
a
liberty
interest.
and
what
we
are
discussing
here
is
the
incarceration
of
people,
somebody
being
kept
in
prison
for
a
period
of
time;
in
this
case,
100
days;
in
other
cases,
up
to
700
days,
or
perhaps
a
three-year
incarceration.
i
believe
that
liberty
interest
is
of
an
equal
standing
with
liberty
interests
in
the
deportation
cases.
i
would
also
note
that
in
the
past,
that
the
review
for
arbitrary
and
capricious
includes
reviewing
factual
support
for
the
questioned
decision.
the
specific
issue
of
whether
there
has
to
be
some
or
sufficient
evidence
in
prison
disciplinary
hearings
has
been
met
by
many
circuit
courts,
and
the
vast
majority
of
them--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--that
there
is
some
evidence
which
can
rationally
permit
a
board's
finding.
i
would
argue
that--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--no,
your
honor.
the
court
below
only
adopted
the
"some
evidence"
standard.
they
indicated
that
there
were
differences
among
the
circuits
between
whether
there
had
to
be
some
evidence
or
substantial
evidence.
however,
in
this
case,
as
they
found,
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
decision;
they
would
use
only
the
most
lenient,
"some"
or
"any"
evidence
standard.
and
i
would--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--i
would
believe
that
there
was
no
evidence
before
one
could
rationally
prove
that
any
one
of
those
three
people
was
a
person
involved
in
an
assault.
if
there
had
been
ten
people
in
that
yard,
there
had
been
15
people
in
that
yard,
could
the
same
evidence
say
that
all
15
were
involved
in
the
assault?
some
evidence
may
be
relevant.
the
fact
the
prisoner--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--no,
your
honor,
i
believe
if
there's
more
than
one.
if,
under
this
set
of
circumstances,
there
was
more
than
one
person,
there
was
no
evidence
from
what
you
could
reasonably
infer
that
any
one
of
those
particular
persons
was
involved
in
the
assault.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
would
agree.
there
were
three
people.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
meant
i
would
disagree
that
it
does
not
meet
the
standard.
there
were
three
people.
there
is
no
evidence
to
infer
that
each
of
those
three
people
was
involved
in
the
assault.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
believe
it
would
be
the
same,
your
honor,
if
there
were
two
people.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
if
there's
no
evidence
to
indicate
that
both
of
those
people
were
involved
in
the
assault,
which
could
have
easily
been
done
by
one
person--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--no,
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we're
saying
something
that
you
can
rationally
make
an
inference
from.
because
there
were
two
people,
how
can
you
rationally
make
an
inference
that
both
of
them
did
an
act?
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
except
that,
as
the
supreme
judicial
court
indicates,
that
even
if
you
consider
the
flight
as
more
than
demonstrating
the
reluctance
to
be
found
at
the
scene
of
assault,
you
cannot
fairly
infer
that
more
than
one
person
struck
the
inmate.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
to
convict
all
three
of
shooting
the
gun?
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--you
could
charge
all
three,
and
then
depending
on
what
evidence
was
produced,
perhaps
you
could
find
all
three.
but
if
the
same
situation
occurred,
that
the
guard
did
not
see
the
assault,
did
not
see
the
people--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--well,
your
honor,
in
some
cases
the
disciplinary--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--i'm
saying
that
in
some
cases
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
find
somebody
guilty,
because
you
don't
know
who
is
guilty.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
certainly
that
does
happen.
it
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
it
happens
in
many
cases
there
is
some
other
evidence;
for
example,
blood
on
one
of
the
prisoner's
shirts
would
have
shown
he
was
in
closer
contact.
or
the
fact
the
guard
may
have
been
able,
in
some
case,
to
see
what's
going
on.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
believe
that
it
is
less
than
the
review;
that
generally
in
many
administrative
actions,
the
review
is
for
sufficient
evidence.
i
believe
this
is
what
the
supreme
court,
judicial
court,
has
done
is
somewhat
less...
some
or
any
evidence.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
because
this
isn't
a
review
of
the
factual
findings.
it
does
not
review
the
credibility
or
the
weight
that
the
board
gives,
and
that
is
something
that
comes
from
their
expertise
within
the
prison.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
believe
it
takes
it
into
account
in
the
fact
that
it
does
not
hold
an
evidentiary
review
and
it
does
not
question
whether
what
the
board
found
is
credible
or
not
credible
evidence.
all
the
court
does
is
looks
at
the
evidence
the
board
found
and
says
can
that
support.
and
that
is
certainly
what
the
board
does
in
every
administrative
proceeding.
no
one
would
contend
that
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
the
energy
regulators
of
our
nation,
the
federal...
the
fcc...
don't
have
expertise.
and,
in
fact,
the
deference
to
that
is
that
we
do
not
go
through
the
total
evidentiary
hearing.
the
court
isn't
going
to
say
well,
was
this
guard
telling
the
truth,
wasn't
he
telling
the
truth.
it's
going
to
look
at
what
the
board
found
as
credible
evidence,
and
then
say,
as
judges
say
in
every
case,
is
that
legally
enough
evidence,
is
that
some
evidence
on
which
somebody
can
be
found
guilty?
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
believe
it's
similar
to
the
de
novo
reviews
for
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
in
administrative
cases,
which
would
be
in
some
cases
whether
the
board
acted
arbitrarily
or
capriciously.
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
note
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
does
not
postulate
a
standard
that
is
stronger
than
the
"some
or
any
evidence".
when
you're
talking
about
evidence,
at
some
point
you
have
to
be
discussing
evidence
that
the
fair
fact-finding
can
rely
on.
the
fact
that
the
inmate
was
in
the
institution
on
the
day
an
assault
occurred
is
relevant
evidence,
however
tenuous,
but
is
relevant.
certainly
that
would
not
be
evidence
that's
some
evidence
of
guilt.
one
must
look
at
whether
the
evidence
would
rationally
permit
a
board's
finding
of
guilt,
and
that's
all
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
did.
i'd
like
to
bring
up
the
statute,
the
writ
of
certiorari,
because
as
i
indicated,
i
think
there's
agreement
among
the
parties
on
many
issues,
there
seems
to
be
a
disagreement
as
to
the
mechanism
for
proceeding
to
court,
that
the
petitioner
seems
to
be
arguing
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
has
postulated
an
independent
constitutional
mechanism
for
proceeding
to
court.
the
massachusetts
petition
writ
of
certiorari
is
a
very
broad
writ.
it
states
that
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--i'm
reading
from
the
appendix
of
my
brief,
page
4a.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
"a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
correct
errors
in
proceedings
which
are
not
according
to
the
course
of
common
law
may
be
presented
to
a
justice
of
the
supreme
judicial
court.
"
it
then
goes
on
to
state
that:
"it
shall
be
open
to
the
petitioners
to
contend
at
the
hearing
upon
the
petition
that
the
evidence
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
action
complained
of
or
the
basis
of
any
specified
finding
or
conclusion
was
as
a
matter
of
law
insufficient
to
warrant
such
action,
finding
or
conclusion.
"
on
the
question
that
justice
stevens
raised
concerning
procedural
regulations,
in
previous
cases
which
are
cited
in
my
brief,
particularly
commonwealth
v.
cepulonis,
the
inmate
seemed
to
be
arguing
that
the
department
of
corrections
was
not
living
up
to
its
regulations
that
a
decision
must
be
based
on
reliable
evidence,
but
it
was
looking
specifically
at
the
regulations
of
the
department.
and
that
was
heard
under
a
writ
of
certiorari.
i
believe
that,
were
there
a
procedural
defect,
that
if
there
was
no
notice
or
no
hearing
or
something
of
that
nature,
an
inmate
would
certainly
be
able
to
proceed
under
the
writ
of
certiorari.
in
some
ways,
we
are
confusing
what...
what
the
supreme
court
has
determined
is
the
constitutional
right
is
not
the
constitutional
right
to
have
an
independent
mechanism
of
proceeding
to
court,
but
the
constitutional
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
a
due
process
of
a
liberty
interest,
not
to
have
due
process
violated,
and
the
right
of
a
court
to
overturn
an
administrative
decision
that's
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
that
violates
due
process.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
want
this
court
to
say
that
there
was
no
sufficient
facts,
there
was
no
some
evidence
on
which
one
could
reasonably
infer--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--it
certainly--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--certainly
not.
in
cases
where
there's
evidence
as
to
who
committed
the
assault,
one
would
not
close
their
eyes.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
there's
no
testimony
that
they
appeared
to
act
as
a
group.
the
only
testimony
was
the
three
of
the
were
moving
away.
in
many
cases
you
have
guards
observing,
and
i
would
contend,
your
honor,
from
the
basis
of
my
experience
in
disciplinary
hearings,
that
you
do
have
prisoners
testifying
against
each
other.
you
often
have
other
evidence.
you
often
have
a
bloody
hand,
somebody
holding
the
instrument.
there
may
often
be
only
one
person.
but
i'm
saying
in
the
cases
where
a
guard
says
i
did
not
see
the
assault,
where
there
is
no
evidence
that
more
than
one
person
participated
in
the
assault...
because
what
you
would
have
on
the
other
hand,
you
leave
a
prisoner
who's
standing
in
a
yard,
an
assault
occurs,
he
stands
there
at
the
scene
of
the
assault
and
he's
found
guilty
because
he's
standing
there,
or
he
leaves
and
he's
found
guilty
because
he
leaves.
that
certainly
cannot
be
a
fair
or
rational
basis
for
depriving
somebody
of
their
liberty
interests,
for
incarcerating
them
for,
in
this
case,
a
three-month
sentence
based
on
no
evidence
at
all
that
this
individual
participated
in
an
assault.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
under
the
writ
of
certiorari
statute,
what
the
court
will
do
is,
will
look
at
the
standard
to
be
used
based
on
the
particular
issue
brought
before
them,
and
that
is
in
the
case
of
commonwealth
v.
cepulonis.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
do
not
regard
it
as
different
in
this
light.
the
massachusetts
court
has
interpreted
this
standard
as
a
flexible
standard
based
on
the
particular
issue
in
front
of
them.
if
the
issue
in
front
of
them
is
the
constitutional
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
liberty
arbitrarily
and
capriciously,
then
i
believe
that
would
be
the
appropriate
standard.
certainly,
i
argued
below
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
that
a
sufficient
evidence
standard
was
the
appropriate
standard.
i
do
not
believe,
however,
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
this
court
should
make
a
decision
on
the
distinction
between
the
"some"
and
the
"sufficient"
evidence
because
the
court
below
did
not
decide
that.
i
believe
that
the
certiorari
statute
that
the
own
department's
rules
of
regulation
and
other
types
of
indicia
would
lead
the
proper
determination
to
be
a
sufficient
evidence
standard.
however--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--what
the
supreme
judicial
court
adopted,
it
did
not
actually
adopt
the
standard.
what
it
said
is,
we
are
not
going
to
adopt...
we
are
not
going
to
look
at
the
dispute
of
standards
between
whether
it's
some
evidence
or
substantial
evidence,
because
in
this
case
it
only...
the
evidence
here
does
not
meet
the
"some"
evidence
standard.
i
would
argue
that
based
on
other
massachusetts
laws
and
regulations
and
those
in
other
states,
that
a
substantial
evidence
test
might
be
the
more
appropriate
test;
specifically,
when
the
department
itself
is
bound
by
its
own
regulations
that
a
prisoner
must
be
found
guilty
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
again,
substantial
evidence
does
not
raise
that,
but
it
would
be
an
indication
of
their
having
to
follow
their
own
regulation.
however,
in
this
particular
court,
based
on
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
found,
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
go
above
or
argue
beyond
the
some
or
any
evidence
standard.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
a
constitutional
right...
i
believe
what
they
are
saying
is
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
a
liberty
interest,
and
a
constitutional
right
for
a
court
to
overturn
that.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
believe
that
they...
yes.
but
not
as
an
independent
mechanism.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
yes.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
yes.
that's
correct.
i
think
my
reason
for
that
is
again
trying
to
distinguish
the
question
as
to
whether
there's
an
independent
constitutional
mechanism.
the
court
did
not
make
that
decision
below
because
that
issue
was
never
raised.
the
question
of
whether
there's
an
independent--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--i
did
not
appeal
the
factual--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
said
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation;
therefore,
it
could
be
appealed
through
this
court,
were
this
court
to
accept
certiorari.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
the
court
did
not
postulate
an
independent
constitutional
mechanism
saying
that
were
there
no
certiorari
statute,
were
there
no
federal
habeas
were
there
no
1983
actions,
could
you,
based
on
constitutional
right,
have
a
right
to
go
to
court?
that
issue
was
not
argued,
nor
was
it
raised,
from
what
i
can
see
in
the
reading
of
the
cases
in
the
other
courts
that
examined
prison
disciplinary
hearings.
in
each
of
those
cases,
a
writ
of
federal
habeas
corpus
or
1983
or
in
some
cases
similar
state
certiorari
or
habe
statutes
were
used.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
think
the
issue
before
you
is
whether
there
can
be
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
denial
of
a
due
process
right...
excuse
me...
liberty
interest,
and
therefore
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
if
an
inmate
is
found
guilty
of
a
disciplinary
offense,
loses
a
liberty
interest,
based
on
no
or
some
evidence.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
any
or
some
evidence
standard
is
higher.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
would
agree
that
the
lower
court--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--i
would
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
at
pages
16
or
17,
the
judge...
the
court
states:
"the
trial
judge
reviewed
the
evidence
to
determine
whether
there
was
some
evidence
which
it
believed
would
rationally
permit
a
board's
finding.
"
"in
other
cases,
the
court
relies
upon
cases
in
other
courts
which
clearly
indicate
the
some
or
any
evidence
statute.
"
i
think
the
reference
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
again
a...
perhaps
looking
at
it
in
a
different
light,
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not...
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there's
some
evidence.
and
is
the
evidence
presented
legally
sufficient
to
meet
that
standard
of
some
evidence?
that--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--i
believe
the
court
said
the
standard
is
whether
there
is
some
evidence.
i
believe
the
reference
to
sufficiency
is,
you're
looking
for
the
sufficiency,
and
then
the
standard
is,
in
this
case,
whether
there
is
some.
by
specifically
stating
that
this
is
an
alternative
review
to
the
substantial
evidence,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
came
in
with
a
middle
level.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
again--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--i
believe
that
is
great
support
for
my
position.
the
fact
that
the
court--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--yes.
the
court
is
recognizing
that
there
is
an
alternative
standard
to
review,
and
if
one
reads
all
the
cases
one
will
see
two
standards
of
review,
the
some
or
any
evidence,
or
the
sufficient
evidence.
they
in
fact
say
that
they
are
taking
the
lower
standard
in
this
case,
which
is
the
some
or
any
evidence
case.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
believe
that
there
is
an
inherent
right
to
an
independent
constitutional--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--i
believe
if
there
were
no
state
mechanism
for
getting
to
court,
that
a
federal
habeas
in
the
federal
court
would
be
the
more
appropriate.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
yes.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
do
not
believe
they
decided
that.
i
believe
they
decided--
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
--yes,
and
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
that
he
not
be
deprived
of
a
liberty
interest
without
some
or
any
evidence;
that
the
right,
the
federal
constitutional
right
that's
being
vindicated
is
the
right
to
due
process.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
believe
so.
i
believe
that
was
the
mechanism,
as
opposed
to
the
right
being
vindicated,
the
mechanism
for
going
to
court.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
i
believe
that
would
have
been
open
to
the
petitioner.
i
believe
that
there
might
be
some
argument
under
our
state
constitution
as
well.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
this
court
has
ruled
that
1983
is
not
the
appropriate
avenue
for
restoring
good
time
credits.
pressler,
i
believe,
stated
that
a
habeas
statute
was
the
appropriate
for
the
restoration
of
good
times,
and
1983
was
for
damages.
ms.
jamie
ann
sabino
yes,
i
would
agree
with
his
analysis.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
