unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
ms.
smith,
i
gather
that
massachusetts
practice
provides
for
this
review
in
superior
court,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
how
much
of
this
is
state
law?
unknown
speaker
so
whether
or
not...
i
think
you
suggested
the
inmates
have
a
constitutional
or
nonconstitutional
claim
in
respect
to
a
disciplinary
hearing,
they
are
not
entitled
to
any
judicial
review--
unknown
speaker
--when
you
say
sufficiency,
would
that
be...
are
you
questioning
the
standard?
suppose
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
instead
of
what
you
had
here.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
would
concede
that
the
law,
whether
it
was...
say,
federal
law...
requires
that
there
be
some
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
finding
of
guilt.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
agree
that
the
constitution
requires
review
to
that
extent?
unknown
speaker
so
your
argument
really
is
on
the
standard
of
whether
it's
sufficiency
or
just
some
evidence.
that's
your
real
bone
of
contention.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
agreed
with
me
that
you
did
need
reviewability
in
general
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
decision
was
entirely
arbitrary.
how
else
could
you
ever
know
it
was
entirely
arbitrary
without
some
kind
of
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
agree
it's
reviewable
to
that
extent.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
not
complaining
there's
no
review
at
all.
unknown
speaker
which
i
think
then
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
you
are
disagreeing
on
the
standard
of
review.
that's
the
whole
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
else
is
there?
unknown
speaker
is
the
standard
to
be
applied
a
matter
of
procedural
due
process
or
substantive
due
process
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
standard
might
be
found
applicable
to
this
type
of
claim,
whether
it
is,
as
you
suggest,
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
unsupported
by
substantial
evidence,
which
i
guess
is
the
respondent,
isn't
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
prisoner
in
any
case?
unknown
speaker
so
part
of
your
argument
as
to
the
nature
of
the
right
in
question
perhaps
goes
to
where
the
burden
of
proof
lies.
unknown
speaker
then
do
you
or
don't
you
think
that
the
constitution
requires
review
of
prison
disciplinary
decisions
that
are
arbitrary?
does
the
constitution
require
any
judicial
review
in
any
case?
i
thought
your
point
here
was
that--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
one
of
your
points
was
that
the
constitution
doesn't
require
any
judicial
review,
no
matter
what
the
facts
are.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
is
your
submission
that
we
should
say
that
as
long
as
prison
officials
go
through
the
procedures,
they're
just
not
subject
to
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what
the
evidence
is?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
we
find
that
the
constitution
requires
some
review.
unknown
speaker
what
you
describe
as
your
position,
which
i
take
it
is
your
front
line
position,
to
justice
white
would
not
include
our
review,
even
for
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness.
unknown
speaker
ms.
smith,
may
i
interrupt
again
on
the
basic
right
to
judicial
review?
you're
quite
correct
that
in
ortwein,
the
court
held
there
was
no
right
to
judicial
review,
but
the
basis
for
that
was
the
premise,
even
in
criminal
cases,
there
is
no
right
to
judicial
review.
but
that
does
not
mean,
as
i
understand
the
holding,
that
there's
no
right
to
review
of
the
question
whether
the
judgment
was
constitutionally
permissive.
it's
not
review
of
the
basic
merits
of
the
case,
but
whether
the
judgment
is
void
because
it
was
not
in
conformity
to
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
does.
but
for
years
it
was
thought
that
the
review
on
an
evidentiary
basis,
a
constitutional
question
would
be
whether
there
was
some
or
any
evidence,
the
jackson
v.
virginia
standard...
or
the
thompson
v.
louisville
standard.
whether
that's
been
modified
by
jackson
v.
virginia,
i
don't
know.
but
surely,
you're
not
contending
that
there
is
no
proceeding
in
which
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
prison
action
can
be
looked
at
is
required,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
that
situation,
ms.
smith,
would
be
saved
by
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard,
would
it
not,
because
i
would
think
there
you
are
not
limited
to
just
what...
you
know,
what
a
reporter's
transcript
might
show.
you
could
come
into
the
court
proceeding
and
say
this
was
done
in
the
context
of
such
and
such.
unknown
speaker
in
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
other
question
on
the
threshold
question,
whether
there
is
any
judicial
review
at
all.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief,
page
8,
says
that
the
question
whether
the
constitution
requires
judicial
review
of
the
claim
arises
only
when
the
applicable
statutes
would
otherwise
bar
an
aggrieved
party
from
raising
a
claim
in
court.
if,
as
in
this
case,
a
statute
authorizes
judicial
review,
there
is
no
need
to
determine
whether
such
review
is
constitutionally
required.
then
on
page
9,
he
interprets
the
supreme
judicial
court's
holding
as
an
interpretation
of
state
statutes
authorizing
judicial
review.
do
you
agree
or
disagree?
unknown
speaker
you
just
think
he's
read
the
case
incorrectly?
unknown
speaker
the
solicitor
general
thought
it
was
a
civil
action
in
the
nature
of
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
certiorari
is
available
in
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
it
could
have
been
done?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
and
certiorari
only
exists
if
there
is
a
constitutional
right.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
right,
ms.
smith?
unknown
speaker
footnote
3,
as
you
have
already
told
us,
says
there
is
no
statutory
right
of
review.
decisions
of
the
department
of
correction
are
not
reviewable
on
sites,
your
massachusetts
statute.
but
you
are
now
telling
us
that
there
is,
however,
certiorari
review
at
least
in
some
limited
way?
unknown
speaker
which
one
is
the
other?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
inconsistent
between
the
two
footnotes?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
a
common
law
of
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
of
a
limited--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
nature
is?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
ms.
smith,
the
colloquy
has
left
me
a
little
bit
confused.
what
do
you
say
about
the
amicus
briefs
of
the
government
citing
about
massachusetts
law
authorizes
review
of
the
decision
of
the
prison
disciplinary
board.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
an
inmate
filed
a
piece
of
paper
in
a
massachusetts
state
court
and
labeled
it
common
law
writ
of
certiorari,
in
which
he
alleged
that
sanctions
were
imposed
on
him
in
a
disciplinary
proceeding
at
which
no
evidence
was
put
before
the
trier
of
fact?
would
he
get
review
of
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
apart
from...
before
the
hill
decision.
would
state
law
authorize
the
judge
to
consider
those
allegations?
unknown
speaker
but
according
to
footnote
2,
it
would
review
it
pursuant
to
general
law,
chapter
249,
section
4,
which
is
your
common
law
writ
of
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
a
statutory
right.
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
ms.
smith,
is
the
common
law
writ
under
the
statute
a
discretionary
writ?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
decide
evidentiary
questions?
what
if
the
man
alleged
that
i
got
no
hearing
at
all;
they
didn't
follow
the
procedure
specified
by
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
in
any
respect.
i
was
unconstitutionally
deprived
of
my
good
time,
earned
good
time.
could
he
bring
that
proceeding
in
your
common
law
writ
of
certiorari,
even
apart
from
hill?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
there
is
just
no
state
remedy
for
a
prisoner's
claim
that
he
was
deprived
of
liberty
without
any--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
think
it's
a
fair
reading
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
opinion
that
there's
no
federal
remedy,
i
mean
no
state
remedy?
i
sure
don't
read
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
we've
never
decided
that
before,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
we
have
never
decided
that
until
today,
i
guess,
or
we
wouldn't
be
here.
unknown
speaker
where
have
we
decided?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we've
never...
we've
never
had
a
holding
to
this
effect
in
the
context
of
prison
disciplinary
hearings.
unknown
speaker
in
what
context?
prison
or
immigration--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's
quite
a
different
matter,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
then
that
if
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record,
that's
enough?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
argue
for
the
standard,
then,
adopted
apparently
by
the
court
below?
it
was
a
substantial
evidence
standard
apparently.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
there
was
indeed
no
evidence
here
by
virtue
of
the
appearance
that
only
the
four
prisoners
were
in
the
area;
that
the
one
who
was
injured
was
complaining,
and
the
other
three
were
jogging
away?
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
very
fact
that
there
are
only
three
or
four
here,
rather
than
the
15
in
your
hypothesis,
isn't
that
one
of
the
factors
that
perhaps
makes
what
otherwise
might
be
unreasonable
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
certainly
can
plausibly
infer
that
there
was
a
50
percent
chance
that
either
one
of
them
was
involved.
you
say
that
doesn't
meet
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test?
unknown
speaker
you
say
you
would
agree
that--
unknown
speaker
--how
about
if
there
were
two
people?
unknown
speaker
that's
still
arbitrary
and
capricious.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
were
all
three
leaving
the
scene,
as
it
were,
maybe
that
indicates
they
were
all
three
involved.
maybe
they
all
took
a
punch
at
him.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
question,
i
guess.
the
question's
really
now...
suppose
there
was
a
gunshot,
and
there
was
one
gun
and
there
were
three
people
there.
would
that
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
no.
to
charge
all
three
of
them.
unknown
speaker
and
couldn't
you
find
that
one
of
those
three
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
know
any
other
way
of
doing
it
than
for
everybody
to
confess
but
one?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
talking
about
some
cases;
you're
talking
about
what's
sensible.
unknown
speaker
do
you
ever
find
prisoners
whistling
on
other
prisoners?
unknown
speaker
is
the
review
here
something
in
the
nature
of
review
of
administrative
action
generally?
unknown
speaker
then
what
deference
is
due
to
the
people
who
are
living
with
and
working
with
inmates
of
prisons
365
days
a
year,
less
a
little
vacation?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
court
in
reviewing
it
cannot
take
into
account
that
people
who
run
prisons
have
some
special
knowledge
of
the
conduct
of
human
beings
who
are
inmates
of
prisons?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
as
judges
say
in
every
case,
ms.
sabino,
are
you
saying
it's
just
like
review,
say,
of
a
civil
case
in
a
bench
trial,
kind
of
clearly
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from,
ms.
sabino?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
ms.
sabino,
it's
your
assertion
basically
that
in
the
context
of
prison
disciplinary
proceedings,
that
you
want
this
court
to
say
it's
unconstitutional
to
discipline
all
three
members
of
a
group
that
may
well
have
been
acting
together
in
assaulting
another
prisoner.
unknown
speaker
isn't
this
just
a
typical
example
of
what
happens
day
in
and
day
out
in
prisons?
unknown
speaker
some
prisoner
is
subjected
to
assaults
by
some
small
group
of
fellow
prisoners,
and
you
want
us
to
in
effect
say
we'll
have
to
close
our
eyes
to
that.
unknown
speaker
but
the
prisoners
will
never
testify
against
each
other.
what
more
can
you
have
than
the
guard
reporting
here
were
three
fellow
prisoners
involved
in
a
scuffle,
and
they
appeared
to
act
as
a
group
and
ran
away
as
a
group?
and
why
shouldn't
that
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
ms.
sabino,
the
certiorari
statute
you
referred
us
to
speaks
of
insufficient
to
warrant
the
action.
is
that
a
different
standard
under
that
statute
than
what
you
concede,
i
think,
is
the
proper
standard...
some
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
what
i
want
to
get
at
is,
you
regard
this
as
different
from
what
i
gather
you
concede
is
the
proper
standard...
some
evidence?
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
say
earlier
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
actually
adopted
the
"some"
evidence
standard?
but
that
was
not
in
connection
with
the
certiorari
statute,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
supreme
judicial
court
did
proceed
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
rather
long
answer
to
a
simple
question.
didn't
they
proceed
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
judicial
review
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
then
they
thought
that
they
would
not
decide
what
the
standard
of
review
was
in
this
case,
because
they
didn't
need
to.
unknown
speaker
because
they
thought
there
was
no
evidence
at
all.
unknown
speaker
you
would
appeal
the
factual
point
all
the
way
to
this
court?
unknown
speaker
i'm
saying,
is
that
what
the
court
said,
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
they
go
further?
unknown
speaker
i
hope
not.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you...
i
notice
that
in
your
brief,
you
don't
quote
any...
what
you
think
the
questions
presented
are.
what
do
you
think
the
issue
before
us
is?
unknown
speaker
that's
almost...
see,
your
opponent
in
the
second
question
is
whether
there
needs
to
be
a
standard
more
stringent
than
review
for
action
which
is
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
an
abuse
of
discretion.
what
you're
saying
is
the
same
standard
as
the
court
used,
because
the
no
evidence
standard
is
the
same
as
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
so
i
don't
think
the
two
of
you
really
are
arguing
about
the
standard,
unless
your
opponent
might
say
some
evidence
is
a
higher
standard
than
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard,
but
i'm
not
sure
it
is.
unknown
speaker
and
i
don't
find
a
question
presented
as
to
whether
the
particular
facts
here,
three
people
running
away
from
the
scene,
there's
no
question
presented
as
to
whether
that
satisfies
the
arbitrary
standard
or
the
some
evidence
standard.
that's
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
so
we
have
a
case
before
us
in
which
two
courts
have
said
there
was
no
evidence.
and
then
the
question
is
whether
that
was
the
right
standard.
well,
now
is
that
correct
that
all
the
court
below
said,
judicial
review
is
to
be
limited
to
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
and
then
it
reviewed
this
evidence
and
said
one
can't
say
that
this
is
sufficient
to
support
the
findings.
the
court
never
said
there
is...
we're
reviewing
it
for
no
evidence.
they
just
said
it
wasn't
sufficient.
when
i
read
the
opinion,
i
assumed
they
recognized
that
there
was
some
evidence
here,
but
they
thought
it
wasn't
sufficient,
so
of
course
that
question
is
here.
the
court
below
clearly
applied
something
other
than
the
no
evidence
standard.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
what
the
court
said
the
standard
was.
it
said
the
standard
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
opinion
will
just
speak
for
itself,
won't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
sabino,
don't
you
get
any
support
for
your
position
from
footnote
5,
page
17?
unknown
speaker
excellent.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
isn't
one
of
the...
do
you
think
there
is
an
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
a
state
court
must
give
under
the
federal
constitution,
judicial
review
to
a
prison
disciplinary
decision?
i'll
put
it
another
way.
suppose
the
massachusetts
courts
had
said
well,
under
our
law,
there
is
just
no
review
in
the
courts
of
prison
disciplinary
decisions.
we
just...
that's
just
the
law
in
this
state.
do
you
think
the
federal
constitution
would
require
the
massachusetts
courts
to
give
some
review?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be;
that
may
be;
but
must
the
state
court
furnish
direct
review
of
the
prison
disciplinary
decision?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
there
would
be
federal
habeas
available.
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
think
that
the
court
below
decided
that
the
federal
constitution
required
them,
the
state
courts,
to
give
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
just
said
that
this
appellant
is
in
the
courts
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
state
law
is
what
got
this
person
into
the
massachusetts
courts?
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
state
hadn't
provided
a
mechanism,
then
the
proper
course
would
have
been
federal
habeas?
unknown
speaker
would
1983
be--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
if
you
agree
with...
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
analysis
of
the
entire
case,
as
i
understand,
except
for
his
final
paragraph
in
which
he
says
there
really
isn't
enough
evidence
to
meet
the...
there
really
was
enough
evidence
to
meet
the
standard.
unknown
speaker
where
is
it
in
yours?
unknown
speaker
four
and
five
of
what?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
did
it
omit,
ms.
smith?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
the
court
below,
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
did
not
hold
that
the
state
courts
were
required
to
give
review
of
a
prison
disciplinary
decision?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
all
right,
thank
you.
