ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
particular
issues
that
we
bring
to
this
court
for
review
are
whether
the
due
process
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
as
held
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
requires
judicial
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
factual
findings
of
the
prison
disciplinary
board
when
those
findings
form
the
basis
for
a
loss
of
good
time
credits
to
inmates.
second,
assuming
that
judicial
review
is
required,
whether
the
constitution
requires
any
greater
scrutiny
than
inquiry
into
whether
the
decision
is
supported
by
some
or
any
facts.
the
particular
issues,
however,
i
think
implicate
a
much
more
fundamental
and
far-reaching
issue,
and
that
is
the
extent
to
which
the
court
will
involve
itself
in
the
internal
decisionmaking
ability
of
prison
administrators.
this
case
concerns
what
i
believe
is
a
very
central
concern
of
the
prison
system
and
that
is
the
ability
of
the
administrators
to
maintain
discipline
within
the
system.
this
decision
goes
far
beyond
merely
requiring
certain
procedural
requirements
of
the
disciplinary
hearing,
but
indeed
establishes
the
court
as
the
ultimate
fact
finder
in
this
area.
to
subject
the
internal
determinations
regarding
discipline
to
judicial
second-guessing
will
result
in
substantial
disruption
to
the
prison
system,
to
unnecessary
but
increasing
demands
on
the
judiciary,
and
will
result
in
minimal
salutary
benefit
to
the
inmates.
now,
the
specific
incidents
which
give
rise
to
the
instant
case
are
as
follows.
i
will
be
very
brief.
a
guard
on
duty
at
a
wing
door
into
the
yard
at
walpole
state
prison
heard
an
inmate
call
out,
"what's
going
on
here"?
the
guard
moved
to
a
window
in
the
door
leading
out
to
the
yard,
where
he
again
heard
the
inmate
call
out,
"what's
going
on
here"?
he
peered
out
the
window,
observed
a
commotion,
opened
the
door,
and
found
the
inmate
bleeding
from
his
mouth,
with
a
puffed
eye.
he
immediately
observed
three
inmates
jogging
away
down
a
closed-in
walkway
into
the
regular
yard.
disciplinary
reports
issued
and
a
hearing
was
held
for
each
inmate.
the
reporting
officer
testified
substantially
as
i
have
just
described.
however,
in
the
hearing
for
innate
crawford...
hill...
i'm
sorry...
the
officer
testified
that
a
medic
had
told
him
that
the
injuries
were
consistent
with
the
inmate
having
been
beaten.
crawford
testified
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
event
and
offered
an
affidavit
from
the
injured
inmate
that
crawford
had
not
been
involved.
hill
also
testified
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
event.
the
board
found
the
inmates
guilty
and
ordered
loss
of
100
days'
good
time
credits.
hill
and
crawford
appealed
to
the
superintendent
who
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
disciplinary
board.
by
regulation,
the
commissioner
of
correction
also
reviews
any
loss
of
good
time
cases.
the
inmates
then
filed
a
pro
se
complaint
in
the
superior
court
of
massachusetts,
alleging
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
support
the
finding
of
the
disciplinary
board.
the
superior
court,
having
reviewed
the
disciplinary
board's
findings,
concluded
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
board's
findings
of
guilty
rested
on
no
evidence
constitutionally
adequate
to
support
the
findings
of
the
board.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
believe
it
provides
only
as
a
result
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
held
in
this
case.
now,
the
superintendent
appealed
the
superior
court
decision,
alleging
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
judicial
review
of
this
nature,
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
findings.
the
supreme
judicial
court
held
that
there
is
no
statutory
right
of
review
in
massachusetts
for
issues
of
this
nature,
but
that
its
reading
of
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
it
felt,
logically
entitled
an
inmate
to
judicial
review
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
therefore,
having
reached
this
result,
the
court
construed
massachusetts
law,
particularly
the
certiorari
aspect
of
massachusetts
law,
as
providing
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
raising
this
constitutional
claim;
not
that
it
was
an
independent
statutory
right,
independent
of
the
constitutional
finding.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
decision,
i
don't
believe,
is
state
law
at
all.
throughout
the
opinion,
the
supreme
judicial
court
refers
to
this
court's
decision
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
and
they
rule
specifically
and
that
was
the
issue
presented
to
them,
that
it
is
the
constitution,
the
due
process
clause
in
the
united
states
constitution
which
mandates
judicial
review.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our
position.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
then
i
think,
your
honor,
we'd
got
into
a
question
of
whether
there
is
an
arbitrary
capricious
denial
of
the
inmates'
liberty
interest,
which
i
believe
is
quite
different
from
the
court
reviewing
the
weight,
the
credibility,
the
quantum
of
evidence
upon
which
a
board
makes
its
decision.
and
it
is
the
latter
that
our
court
has
said--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--i
believe
that
that
is
the
scope
of
review
where
there
is
a
claim
of
an
arbitrary
denial
of
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
one
bone
of
contention.
the
other
bone
of
contention
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
the
reviewability
in
general.
and
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
separate
the
question
of
reviewability
in
general
from
the
question
of
scope
of
review,
because
many
of
the
same
factors
inform
the
decision
in
both
areas.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
then
i
might
rephrase
it;
reviewable
only
for
arbitrary
or
capriciousness,
but
not
reviewable
for
determination
of
sufficiency.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
to
that
extent,
yes.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
your
honor.
but
to
a
very
limited
extent
is
there
any
review.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
certainly
a
large
part
of
the
case,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
pass
over
or
just
ignore
the
question
of
what
is
the
constitutionally
required
general
scope
of
reviewability.
and
i
will
move
ahead
in
my
argument,
and
i
think
the
case
of
ortwein
v.
schwab
points
out
what
i
mean
here.
in
that
case,
a
petitioner
claimed
that
an
order
reducing
his
welfare
benefits
was
not
supported
by
reliable,
probative,
or
substantive
evidence.
now,
judicial
review
was
provided
by
the
state
there;
however,
a
$25
filing
fee
precluded
these
indigent
appellants
from
having
access
to
the
state-provided
judicial
review.
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
due
process
violation.
it
held
that
due
process
did
not
require
appellate
review,
that
due
process
only
requires
a
predetermination
evidentiary
hearing.
and
where
procedural
requirements
are
met,
due
process
requires
nothing
more.
now,
that
case
dealt
with
reviewability.
it
didn't
limit
itself
to
the
standard
that
would
be
applied
if
someone
alleged
arbitrary
and
capriciousness.
i
think
it
is
on
all
fours
with
the
question
that
we
are
presenting
here,
and
that
the
same
reasoning
that
applies
in
ortwein
should
be
applied
in
the
case
at
hand.
going
back
to,
if
i
may,
the
reliance
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
on
the
wolf
decision,
i
think
it's
entirely
misplaced
and
reads
much
too
much
into
that
decision.
in
wolff,
this
court
merely
set
out
certain
procedural
requirements
to
be
applied
to
disciplinary
hearing,
included
advanced
written
notice
of
the
charges,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
to
present
evidence
under
certain
circumstances,
and
a
requirement
that
a
written
statement
of
the
evidence
and
the
reasons
for
the
sanction
be
applied.
the
court
indicated
that
these
protections
were
necessary
to
guarantee
fundamental
fairness.
the
court
never
indicated
that
judicial
review
of
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
an
additional
constitutionally
necessary
safeguard,
or
that
there
was
a
constitutionally
required
evidentiary
standard.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
procedural
due
process.
i
think
the
question
is
if
a
hearing
has
been
held,
there
has
been
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
the
hearing
is
conducted
in
a
regular
fashion
as
the
court
indicated
in
wolff,
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter...
unless
there
is
an
assertion
with
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
person
making
that
assertion,
that
the
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
but
there
is
no
generalized,
in
a
sense,
appellate
review
of
disciplinary
findings.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
don't
believe
it
was,
your
honor,
in
this
case.
the
court...
the
prisoner
made
the
allegation
there
is
insufficient
evidence.
the
court
reviewed
the
disciplinary
board's
finding
and
made
its
judgment
that
there
was
no
constitutionally
adequate
evidence
to
support.
i
would
think
in
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
considerations,
the
petitioner
would
have
the
burden
of
isolating
some
incident
that
would
indicate
some
kind
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
conduct,
either
that
there
is
no
evidence
or
that
the
board
acted
in
some
type
of
non-impartial
manner
or
in
some
type
of
bad
faith.
in
this
case,
our
court
acknowledged
that
all
the
procedural
requirements
of
wolff
had
been
met,
that
the
decision
was
made
in
good
faith.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
one
of
the
considerations.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
think
that
the
constitution
would--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--i
don't
think
it
does
at
this
point.
i
don't
believe
this
court
has
ever
held
that
it
does.
but--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--yes.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
but
then
it...
that
is
my
position.
if
the
court
finds
that
there
is
some
limited
scope
of
judicial
review,
i
suggest
that
that
scope--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--it
would
be
limited
to
arbitrary
and
capricious
conduct.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
not
the
front
line
position
i'm
taking.
backup
position--
i'd
suggest
that
the
sjc's
reliance
on
the
one
sentence
in
wolff
which
relates
to
the
requirement
of
a
written
record
does
not
give
support
to
their
finding.
in
that
statement,
the
court
only
indicated
the
possibility
of
saying
perhaps
even
review
by
the
court
where
fundamental
constitutional
rights
had
been
abridged.
this
sentence
simply
doesn't
support
the
proposition
that
the
constitution
requires
that
every
disciplinary
hearing
involving
loss
of
good
time
credits
be
reviewed
for
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
loss
of
good
time
credits
does
not
involve
the
loss
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right,
and
in
any
event
the
court
indicated
the
primary
reason
for
the
requirement
of
this
statement
was
for
its
use
in
collateral
administrative
proceedings
such
as
transfer
decisions
based
on
the
incident
or
parole
determinations.
as
i
have
already
indicated
in
the
ortwein
v.
schwab
case,
this
court
has
held
that
due
process
simply
doesn't
require
a
state
to
provide
appellate
review.
now,
in
other
cases,
the
court
has
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
mere
entitlement
to
procedural
protection
in
certain
administrative
hearings
carries
with
it
a
concomitant
right
to
judicial
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
those
hearings.
and
these
determinations
affect
a
broad
range
of
interests,
including
the
welfare
benefit
situation
in
ortwein,
the
situation
in
court
martials
proceedings,
and
in
particular
the
decisions
within
the
deportation
system,
because
the
court
recognizes
that
the
crux
of
due
process
is
you
get
a
fair
hearing.
and
the
court
has
held
that
a
fair
hearing
is
not
established
by
proving
that
the
decision
of
the
fact
finders
was
wrong.
in
tisi
v.
todd,
the
court
specifically
held
that
a
wrong
inference
drawn
from
the
evidence
or
if
it
is
wrongly
decided
that
evidence
that
has
been
introduced
constituted
legal
evidence
of
a
fact
to
be
decided,
the
fact
that
these
mistakes
were
made
doesn't
render
that
hearing
unfair.
and
therefore,
the
court
in
these
areas
has
refused
to
grant
review
to
the
factual
findings
of
the
tribunals.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
doesn't
that
premise
that
there
is
a
constitutional
standard
that
disciplinary
boards
have
to
follow
or
have
to
meet
in
making
their
evidentiary
decisions?
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
was
looking
only
at
review
for
evidentiary
sufficiency,
and
i
am
saying
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
review
of
that
narrow
area.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i'd
just
like
to
mention
the
hewitt
v.
helms
decision
in
which
this
court,
involving
the
transfer
of
an
inmate
to
administrative
segregation
resulting
in
a
curtailment
of
liberty
within
the
prison
system,
held
that
due
process
was
satisfied
if
the
inmate
gets
notices
of
the
reasons
for
the
hearing,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
the
decisionmaker
reviews
the
evidence.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
there
is
an
additional
due
process
procedural
requirement
that
judicial
review
of
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
upon
which
a
transfer
to
decisions
is
based
is
an
additional
requirement
of
due
process.
finally,
in
resolving
the
question
of
reviewability,
i'd
ask
this
court
to
apply
its
traditional
analysis
and
weigh
the
relative
interest
to
the
individual,
to
the
state,
and
to
balance
the
utility
of
judicial
review
against
the
burden
that
it
would
place
upon
the
prison
systems
and
indeed
upon
the
courts.
the
due
process
clause
is
flexible
and
its
scope
depends
on
the
context
in
which
it
is
applied.
this
court
has
already
acknowledged
in
wolff
the
critical
need
to
impose
swift
discipline
in
the
prison
system
to
ensure
the
safety
of
the
other
inmates
as
well
as
the
guards.
the
court
has
already
recognized
that
prison
administrators
have
a
better
grasp
of
their
domain
than
a
reviewing
judge.
and
the
members
of
a
disciplinary
board
have
as
a
matter
of
everyday
experience
knowledge
of
the
particular
physical
structure
of
the
prison.
to
require
judicial
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
then
going
to
require
introduction
of
evidence
of
facts
within
the
common
knowledge
of
the
disciplinary
board.
for
example,
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
only
that
the
assault
took
place
at
the
west
wing
guard
gate,
yard
gate
no.
1;
that
the
inmates
were
observed
right
away,
jogging
away
down
the
walkway;
and
that
they
were
the
only
inmates
in
the
chain
link
area.
now,
as
a
hypothetical
matter,
it
may
well
be
that
the
physical
structure
of
that
area
would
render
it
impossible
for
any
other
inmates
to
have
committed
the
offense.
that
physical
structure
is
well
known
to
the
guards.
they
did
not
put
that
evidence
into
the
record.
but
if
we
are
going
to
have
judicial
review,
we're
going
to
have
to
expand
the
hearing
so
that
we
can
introduce
evidence--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--you
could
under
those...
but
not
under
review
for
just
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
that
would
require
building
a
record
just
for
the
purpose
of
educating
the
reviewing
court
to
what
is
known
to
everyone
else.
we
suggest
that
this
would
place
unnecessary
burden
on
the
prison
system,
and
any
form
of
judicial
review
in
general
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
going
to
place
an
enormous
burden
on
the
courts.
our
statistics
in
1980
show
that
disciplinary
reports
for
major
infractions
were
issued
in
6,900-and-some
cases.
now,
full
disciplinary--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--in
massachusetts
alone.
full
disciplinary
hearings
must
be
held
on
all
these,
and
under
the
current
decision
every
one
of
these
hearings
in
which
good
time
sanctions
were
applied
would
be
automatically
reviewable
by
the
courts
for
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
i
don't
think
i
need
belabor
the
burden
that
would
place
upon
the
court
system.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
disagree.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
think,
unfortunately,
he
was
not
a
party
in
the
case
below,
does
not
know
how
the
case
went
up
to
the
supreme
judicial
court,
and
seems
to
fail
to
recognize
the
fact
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
in
a
footnote
specifically
said
in
this
case
there
is
no
statutory
right
to
review
in
massachusetts.
what
the
court
did,
i
think
what
the
solicitor
general's
office
misses,
is
that
after
finding
a
constitutional
right
to
review,
they
construed
existing
massachusetts
law
to
accommodate
that
constitutional
finding.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
it
was
originally
brought
as
a
civil
action
in
the
nature
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum.
well,
that
clearly
wasn't
making
it.
even
if
it
was
brought
as
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
under
massachusetts
law,
that
too
would
have
been
inappropriate
because
the
remedy
available
was
not
immediate
release,
as
is
required
by
the
state
habeas
corpus.
therefore,
the
court
having
decided
that
constitutional
right
to
bring
this
action
posited
certiorari
as
the
appropriate
vehicle
to
accommodate
the
constitution.
they
were
not
going
to
leave
it,
saying
there's
a
constitutional
right,
but
we
in
massachusetts
will
not
observe
it.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
in
massachusetts,
since
the
finding
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
review.
that
is
the
procedural
mechanism
for
asserting
the
right.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
in
this
case
the
court
indicated
that
would
be
the
proper
way,
and
that
they
would
treat
this
pro
se
complaint.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
don't...
i
do
agree
that
if
there
is
a
constitutional
right,
the
appropriate
vehicle
may
well
be
certiorari.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
was
the
court's
holding
here,
that
certiorari...
no
one
brought
the
action
in
the
nature
of
certiorari,
but
that
since
there
is
a
constitutional
right,
massachusetts
must
provide
some
vehicle
for
asserting
the
right,
and
they
indicated--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--constitutional
right
to
judicial
review.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
explain
the
court's
two
footnotes.
in
the
one,
i
think
they
correctly
say
there's
no
statutory
right
to
review.
in
the
other--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--footnote
2.
they
note
that
the
actions
were
brought
as
writs
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum.
they
say
that
the
actions
should
have
been
brought
as
civil
actions
in
the
nature
of
certiorari.
now,
at
page--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--no.
because
there's
no
statutory
right
to
review.
it--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--right.
and
if
there's
a
constitutional
right--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--nature.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
limited
to
the
finding
that
here
we
have
the
constitutional
right
to
review.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
page
15
of
their
opinion
in
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari,
i
think
they
make
it
quite
clear
that
they
are
construing
the
existence
of
this
vehicle
to
fit
with
their
view...
as
they
say,
in
view
of
our
conclusion
that
inmates
have
a
constitutional
right
to
such
review.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
they
misunderstand
what
the
court
decided
in
hill.
massachusetts
law
does
not
independently,
of
the
court's
decision
in
hill
that
there
exists
a
constitutional
right
to
review.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
since
the
hill
decision?
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
massachusetts
law
provides
for
extremely
liberal
construction
of
pro
se
prisoner/inmate
complaints.
i
would
say
if
the
court
construed
that
complaint
as
an
allegation
that
he
was
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
denied
his
liberty
interest,
that
the
court
might
well
review
it.
however,
that
matter
has
never
been
litigated
and
our
supreme
judicial
court
hasn't
ruled
on
whether
you
can--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--but
that
defines
a
type
of
complaint.
that
does
not
provide
a
statutory
right
to
review.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
well,
our
supreme
court
said
that
there
is
no
statutory
right
to
review
in
the
footnote
that
justice
brennan--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--i
believe
it
is.
i'm
not
absolutely
certain.
i
believe
it
is.
and
it
has
since
been
abolished.
but
one
can
still
bring
actions
in
the
nature
of
certiorari,
nature
of
mandamus
and
so
forth.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--well,
we
have
a
state
civil
rights
statute,
where
if
you
make
certain
allegations
about
invidious
action
on
the
part
of
the
police,
that
you
might
have
that
reviewed.
but
he
certainly
has
access
to
the
federal
courts
under
the
situation
that
you
posit,
either
under
1983
or
in
some
instances
under
federal
habeas
corpus.
so
the
inmate
is
certainly
not
deprived
of--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--no,
i
don't
say
there
is
no
state
remedy.
there
is
a
state
vehicle
for
raising
the
constitutional
claim,
that
being
i
have
a
constitutional
right
to
judicial
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
and
that
is
all
that
our
court
said.
i
see
that
my
time
is
just
about
gone,
and
i
would
only
on
this
question
of
the
scope
of
review
ask
this
court
to
limit
any
scope
to
the
general
concerns
of
arbitrary
and
capricious.
thank
you.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
just
for
purposes
of
clarifying
for
the
court
the
appropriate
certiorari
statute,
my
respondent
has
cited
the
1953
amended
version
in
her
brief.
that
was
further
amended
in
1963,
omitting
the
sentence
that
was
read
to
the
court.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
appropriate
statute
is
at
page
4
and
5
in
my
redly
brief.
thank
you.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
reply
brief.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
it
omitted
the
sentence
read
to
you
by
the
respondent:
"it
shall
be
open
to
the
petitioner
to
contend
upon
hearing
upon
the
petition
that
the
evidence
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
action
complained
of
or
the
basis
of
any
specified
findings
was
a
matter
of
law
insufficient.
"
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
what
the
court
held
is
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
of
the
state
court
to
give
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
of
the
disciplinary
hearings.
