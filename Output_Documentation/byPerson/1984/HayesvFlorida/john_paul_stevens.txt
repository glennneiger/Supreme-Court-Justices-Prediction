justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
get
back
to
this
case
for
a
moment?
in
this
case
there
are
arguably
two
different
seizures
of
the
person:
one,
taking
him
to
the
station,
and
secondly,
taking
his
fingerprints.
justice
stevens
they're
at
least
analytically
separate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
which
is
the
greater
invasion,
the
more
serious
intrusion
on
the
person
that's
under
arrest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr....
general
munsey,
may
i
just
ask
this
one
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
your
probable
cause
argument.
i
am
correct,
am
i
not,
in
understanding
that
the
evidence
on
which
you
rely
to
establish
probable
cause
was
not
all
presented
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
partly
relies
on
the
trial
transcript.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
adversary?
which
do
you
regard
as
the
greater
intrusion
on
the
citizen's
freedom,
you
might
say...
taking
him
to
the
station
or
taking
his
fingerprints?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
maybe
you
could
invite
the
officer
into
the
living
room.
justice
stevens
right.
well,
in
view
of
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
doesn't
this
come
down,
then,
to
a
seizure
case
rather
than
a
fingerprinting
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
the
argument.
i
frankly
hadn't
thought
it
all
the
way
through,
but
about
the
victim's
testimony
at
the
trial.
isn't
all
that
the
product
of
the
fingerprinting?
i
mean
if
there
had
been
no
fingerprinting,
how
do
we
know
what
would
have
happened
thereafter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
you're
relying
on...
on
the
pre...
the
pre-fingerprinting
identification--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--rather
than
what
she
said
at
trial?
justice
stevens
but
how--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
do
we
know
he
would
have
even
gotten
to
court
if
there
hadn't
been
the
fingerprinting?
did
they
have
enough
to
arrest
him
without
the
fingerprinting
and
bring
him
into
court?
she
didn't
see
him
any
place
except
in
the
courtroom,
did
she?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
thought
the
point
was
that
three
different
people
had
versions
of
what
he
looked
like,
and
together
they
were
able
to
arrange
a
composite
drawing
that
gave
them
their
probable
cause.
