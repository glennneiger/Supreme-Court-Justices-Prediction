justice
white
but
he
can
also
detain
the
person
for
a
brief
period
at
least
to
question
him,
ask
him
some
questions.
justice
white
well,
one
of
the
questions
that
justice
marshall
asked
you,
whether
it
could
be
asked,
was
who
are
you
and
do
you
have
any
identification,
and
you
agree
that
those
questions
may
be
asked.
but
what
if
they...
what
if
the
person
says
sorry,
it's
none
of
your
business,
and
a
person
says...
he's
asked
do
you
have
a
driver's
license,
and
he
says
yes,
i
have
a
driver's
license,
but
you
can't
see
it?
now,
could
the
officer
then
search
him
for
his
driver's
license?
i
take
it
you
say
he
could
not.
justice
white
well,
yeah,
but
he
could...
but--
justice
white
--and
if
the
officer
says
do
you
have...
do
you
have
a
driver's
license,
i
want
to
look
at
your
fingerprints,
and
the
fellow
says
well,
i
have
a
driver's
license,
but
you...
it's
none
of
your
business
about
looking,
and
the
officer
then
searches
him,
not
for
a
gun
or
anything
else
but
for
a
driver's
license.
justice
white
well,
i
think
i
would
say
you
certainly
have
argued
that
he
could
not
do
that.
if
you
argue
that
he
could
not
take
his
fingerprints
right
there
on
the
spot,
surely
you
would
argue
he
could
not
search
him
for
his
driver's
license.
justice
white
well,
wasn't...
they
took
his
prints
at
the
station,
didn't
they?
justice
white
and
didn't
they
match?
justice
white
well,
did--
justice
white
--did
they
release
him
then?
justice
white
well,
what's
that
i
said.
so
how
long
was
he
detained
at
the
station?
he
was
arrested.
justice
white
he
was
detained
for
quite
a
while.
[laughter]
justice
white
--that's
the
answer
to
the
question,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
you
are
going
to
get
to
whether...
to
the
question
of
whether
you
can
take
fingerprints
on
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
white
soon.
