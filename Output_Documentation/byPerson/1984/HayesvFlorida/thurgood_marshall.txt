justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
agreed
that
there
was
no
probable
cause?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
agreed
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
trouble
is
that
the
purpose
of
getting
fingerprints
is
singular:
it's
to
identify,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
for
any
other
purpose
than
identification?
of
course
it's
not.
it's
for
identification.
now,
my
problem
is
if
the
officer
walks
up
to
you
and
says
can
you
identify
yourself,
is
that
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
can
you
show
me
some
identification;
is
that
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
says
do
you
have
any
copy
of
your
fingerprints?
can
he
ask
you
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
copy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
do
you
at
this
time,
at
this
moment
have
a
copy
of
your
fingerprints?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
could
he
then
say
let
me
have
it?
well,
let
me
give
you
the
next
question.
maybe
you
can
answer
that
one.
if
he
doesn't
have
it,
can
he
then
say
may
i
take
your
fingerprints
right
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
in
terry
gives
you
the
right
to
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
he
can't
ask
you
for
your
driver's
license,
because
if
you're
looking
for
joe
doaks
and
your
driver's
license
says
joe
doaks,
and
you
show
that
driver's
license,
you're
in
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
don't
see
the
difference
in...
well,
when
he
gets
to
the
police
station,
can
he
identify
himself
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
good
does
the
warrant
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
isn't
your
protest
that
he
was
arrested
without
probable
cause?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don't
you
say
he
was
arrested
without
probable
cause
when
he
was
carried
to
the
station?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
haven't
argued
it
here.
that's
what
i'm
worried
about.
you
haven't
abandoned
it,
have
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
munsey--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--may
i
back
up
just
a
moment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that
in
some
prior
case
he
was
arrested
and
null
prossed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
one
that
he
wasn't
tried
on,
the
one
he
was
null
prossed
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he
arrested
in
that
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
in
the
world
is
it
that
they
didn't
have
his
fingerprints?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
can't
how
you
can
null
prosse
a
case
when
a
man
is
not
arrested.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
null
prossing
after
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
in
the
world
that's
got
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
in
the
world
does
that
have
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
marshall
the
argument
that
the
government
made
was
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
think
it
was
him
because
he
had
been
null
processed.
justice
marshall
i
understood
the
government's
argument
to
be
that
these
other
asserted
attacks
were
known
to
the
police
at
the
time
they
went
to
his
house,
and
that
that
furnished
an
additional
basis
for
a
probable
cause
arrest
at
that
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that's
not
what
he
said.
