well,
place
and
royer
both
certainly
involve
something
more
than
protection
of
the
officer.
they
were
looking
for
contraband
in
both
cases.
so
i
think
perhaps
terry
on
its
facts
is
protection
of
the
officer,
but
terry
has
been
held
to
support
a
stop
where
you're
looking
for
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
should
you
have
a
second
shot
at
that
issue,
just
because
on
a
purely
unrelated
matter
there
may
have
been
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
taking
the
fingerprint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
could
also
conclude,
could
it
not,
that
for
reasons
stated
by
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal,
this
fingerprinting
was
proper
under
a
terry
standard.
