mr.
michael
e.
raiden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1980
in
the
city
of
punta
gorda,
florida,
there
were
a
series
of
burglaries
and
rapes.
the
primary
clue
as
to
the
identity
of
the
perpetrator
available
to
the
investigating
officers
were
fingerprints.
in
the
particular
case
for
which
the
petitioner
was
convicted,
these
fingerprints
were
found
on
the
bedroom
doorknob
of
the
victim.
the
petitioner
was
one
of
a
number
of
suspects
which
the
police
desired
to
obtain
the
petitioner's
fingerprints
in
order
to
compare
them
with
the
latents
found
in
the
victim's
home.
they
did
not
have
probable
cause.
at
least
that
was
argued
in
the
trial
court,
and
the
appellate
court,
the
florida
appellate
court
agreed
there
was
no
probable
cause.
there
was
no
prior
judicial
authorization
for
obtaining
the
prints,
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
agreed
with
the
petitioner's
argument
that
there
was
no
consent
to
accompanying
the
officers
to
give
the
prints.
however,
the
police
officers
went
to
the
petitioner's
house,
made
it
very
clear
that
he
had
no
choice
but
to
go
with
them--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
it
was
argued
by
the
defense
that
the
state--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--the
court
agreed
with
the
petitioner.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
they
obtained
the
prints
at
the
police
station
after
seizing
mr.
hayes
at
his
home
and
taking
him
to
the
station
and
obtaining
the
prints.
upon
comparing
them
with
the
prints
found
in
the
victim's
home,
they
uncovered
a
match,
and
he
was
then
arrested
and
charged.
he
moved
in
the
trial
court
of
charlotte
county,
florida
to
suppress
the
fingerprint
evidence.
his
primary
case
authority
was
davis
v.
mississippi,
along
with
a
couple
florida
cases
that
had
followed
davis.
and
the
court
denied
the
motion
to
suppress
without
stating
any
particular
reason.
the
state
had
argued
probable
cause
and/or
consent.
it
went
to
the
appellate
court,
and
again,
the
state
argued
probable
cause
and/or
consent.
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
florida
found
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
they
further
found
that
there
was
no
consent.
however,
despite
the
holding
in
davis
v.
mississippi,
they
affirmed
the
trial
court's
decision
not
to
suppress
the
prints,
and
in
so
doing
they
found
justification
in
terry
v.
ohio.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i
think
that
i
would
be,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--well--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--i'd
maintain
that
it
is
still
a
search,
it
is
still
a
seizure.
i
recognize
that
one
of
the
distinctions
between
terry
and
say
dunaway
or
foyer
is
the
movement
of
the
person;
and
there
does
appear
to
be
that
difference.
but
they
had
already
set
up
the
fingerprinting
process
at
the
police
station,
and
we
do
have
an
instance
of
movement
in
this
case.
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
i...
i
find
no
constitutional
difference
in
the
fact
that
they
possibly
could
have
taken
the
prints
at
his
house.
they
still
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
conduct
this
search
and
seizure,
and
they
did
not
have
judicial
authorization,
and
they
did
not
have
consent.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i
find
in
davis
v.
mississippi
that
although
the...
what
happened
here,
the
district
court
said
this
is
the
question
left
open
by
davis,
in
the
opinion
of,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
the
court
could
conceive
of
situations
wherein
fingerprints
might
be
taken
without
necessarily
having
probable
cause
to
do
so.
however,
further
down
in
that
opinion
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
then
said
that
it
would
not...
it
would
not
seem
to
admit
of
any
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
in
the
wake
of
davis,
a
number
of
states
passed
statutes
wherein
under
very
circumscribed
circumstances,
the
police
could
go
to
a
magistrate
and
get
what...
i
called
it
a
mini-warrant
in
the
brief...
but
some
type
of
judicial
authorization
to
go
and
take
prints.
and
it's...
there's
a--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--that's
correct.
they
do
not
require
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i
think
arguably
there
is
a
problem.
i
cited
in
the
brief
a
nebraska
case
where
the
nebraska
court
reviewed
all
the
various
statutes
that
had
been
passed
in
the
wake
of
davis.
and
they
found
that
in
light
of
more
recent
cases
such
as
dunaway
v.
new
york
and
royer
v.
florida
that
whatever
might
have
been
suggested
in
the
davis
opinion,
that
it
could
be
done
without
probable
cause
it
probably
no
longer
is
constitutionally
valid,
and
that
probable
cause
would
be
required
any
time
you
wanted
to
move
someone,
detain
someone
for
that
length
of
time.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
well--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
say
it
did,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--to
take
a
fingerprint
requires
a
little
more
of
the
participation
of
the
individual
than
does
submitting
to
a
photograph.
for
instance,
a
police
officer
conducting
surveillance
perhaps
could
be
tailing
someone
on
a
public
street
and
using
a
telephoto
lens
could
take
that
person's
picture.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
it's
probably
more
intrusive
than
a
photograph.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
agree
with
that,
because
you
have
to
place
your
hands
on
the
person
and
actually
hold
the
person
to
take
a
fingerprint.
the
way--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--yes.
both
of
those
involve
actual
physical
contact
with
the
person,
whereas
photography
doesn't.
incidentally,
what
i
had
urged
vis-a-vis
terry
in
these
cases
is
that
terry,
involves
a
sort
of
search,
it's
not
an
evidentiary
search.
they're
not
looking
for
evidence
of
a
crime.
but
it's
designed
instead
for
the
protection
of
the
officer,
and
the
pat-down--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--yes,
your
honor.
that's--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--when
they
say
in
terry
that
you
may
ask
identity,
i'm
not
sure
the
purpose
of
inquiring
into
identity
is
evidentiary
in
nature.
the
fingerprint,
while
it
is
a
means
of
identification,
it
is
a
means
of
identification
evidence.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
what
i
detect
in
place
and
royer,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
an
element
of
exigency,
although
i
don't
find
that
specific
word
in
the
opinions,
because
of
the
fact
that
these
people
come
and
go
in
airports.
and
if
you
don't
find
out
what
you're
looking
for
right
now,
it's
gone
forever.
but--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--as
i
understood
the
opinion
that
you
announced
yesterday,
first
of
all,
there
had
already
been
an
arrest
warrant
for
the
individual;
is
that
correct?
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
that
is
not
correct.
he
was...
the
reason
they
wanted
to
find
his
identification
is
to
find
out
if
he
was
the
person
wanted.
i
was
mistaken,
and
i
thought
it
involved
the
existence
of
an
arrest
warrant
in
another
jurisdiction.
i
apologize.
i
must
have
misunderstood
the
opinion.
the
question
again
was?
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i
guess
it
might
depend
on
why
you
wanted
the
prints,
although
i'm
not
comfortable
with
saying
that
now
that
i've
just
said
it.
i
sense
a
confusion
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
printing.
printing
someone
simply
to
find
out
who
they
are--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--they've
certainly
urged,
at
least
at
this
level,
that
reversal
would
be,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said
in
davis,
a
useless
gesture.
i'm
not
prepared
to
agree
or
even
to
disagree
other
than
to
say
i
don't
think
that
is
to
be
resolved
at
this
level.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i'm
faced
with
a
record
where
some
things
were
not
done
the
way
i
would
like
to
have
done
them,
and
one
thing
that
disturbs
me
about
this
record
is
there
was
no
move
to
suppress
the
identification
by
the
victim.
i'm
not
saying
it
was
suppressible.
i
don't
think
we
can
determine
that
on
the
face
of
our
record.
yes,
she
did
identify--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--if
a
court...
and
i
submit
most
properly
it
should
be
the
trial
court...
found
that
mrs.
hollander's
in
court
identification
was
constitutionally
permissible,
then
there
probably
is
probable
cause
now,
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
because
i'm
not
prepared
to
state
at
this
point
that
her
identification
is
constitutionally
permissible.
it
may
not
be.
i
don't
think
we
can
determine
that
on
the
record
we
have,
because
no
effort
was
made
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
ordinarily,
your
honor,
there
may
not
be.
i
may
not
deserve
a
second
shot.
but
this...
the
inevitable
discovery
argument
that
the
state
makes
is
being
made
for
the
first
time
at
this
court.
we
did
not
have
the
benefit,
either
at
the
appellate
level...
i
was
not
trial
counsel...
or
at
the
trial
level
of
the
nix
v.
williams
decision.
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
a
very
significant
u.s.
supreme
court
decision
exists
now
that
we
were
not
aware
of,
i
think
perhaps
we
should
be
allowed
to
litigate
that.
in
other
words--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--no,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
to
relitigate
the
identification
issue,
the
admissibility--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--i
don't--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--well,
if
that's
the
first
time
that
she's
ever
seen
him,
that
is
arguably
a
suggestive
procedure.
i'm
not
saying
that
hayes
would
prevail
on
the
identification
issue.
it's
just
that
i
don't
think
we
have
a
sufficient
record,
and
that
issue
was
never
raised,
so
we
don't
have
a
judicial
determination
whether
or
not
her
identification
was
permissible.
if
the
court
determined
that
it
was,
then
hayes--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--here's
what
happened
in
that
regard.
when
you
get
to
the
cross
examination
by
the
trial
counsel
at
about
page
398
of
the
trial
record,
he
asked
this
lady,
"what
you're
saying,
then,
is
that
nobody
knew
until
this
exact
moment
that
you
were
going
to
come
in
here
and
identify
this
person;
is
that
correct.
"
and
she
said,
"yes".
apparently,
there
were
no
efforts
for
her
to
make
an
in
person
identification
of
hayes
up
until
that
moment.
once
had
completed
his
cross
examination,
he
made
a
motion
to
strike
the
testimony.
i
don't
think
that
helps
in
the
determination
we're
talking
about
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
under
florida
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
any
type
of
motion
to
suppress
made
after
the
trial
begins
is
discretionary.
there's
no
absolute
requirement
that
the
judge
hear
it
at
all.
but
number
two,
and
perhaps
more
important,
as
i
understand
mr.
bader's
motion
to
strike,
it
was
directed
wholly
toward
credibility
and
not
legal
admissibility.
so
i
don't
think
we
can
infer
from
that
that
judge
adams,
who
was
the
trial
judge,
ever
made
a
specific
finding
that
mrs.
hollander's
identification
was
legally
valid
and
admissible.
getting
back
to
the
question
that
was
left
open
by
davis
v.
mississippi,
as
i
noted,
after
davis
there
were
a
number
of
states
that
passed
statutes
permitting
fingerprinting
and
similar
identification-oriented
investigations.
some
of
them
could
be
done
at
the
police
station,
and
i
suppose,
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out,
it
could
be
done,
if
you
had
all
of
your
equipment
and
everything
that
was
necessary,
you
probably
could
go
to
the
person's
house
and
do
it.
two
distinctions
i
want
to
make
there.
number
one,
the
fact
remains
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
was
moved,
and
what
i
sense
from
some
of
the
frustration
that
i
detect
in
trying
to
resolve
the
royer
case
was
the
end
conclusion
was
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
matter
that
they
could
have
detained
royer
undue
a
sort
of
terry
stop.
nevertheless,
they
didn't
do
it
that
way.
what
they
did
to
royer
was
to
move
him,
and
that
brings...
that
presents
problems.
and
if
he's
moved,
he's
detained
for
an
unreasonable
length
of
time,
that
it's
too
bad.
it
could
possibly
have
been
done
in
a
legal
manner.
it
wasn't
done
in
a
legal
manner.
a
point
i
wanted
to
make
about
these
statutes
is
that
regardless
of
the
exact
procedure
specified,
i
in
the
brief
quoted
from
the
colorado
statute
which
is
quite
rigorous
in
its
requirements.
when
you
have
only
a
reasonable
suspicion,
you
may
still
get
an
authorization
to
take
prints
or
whatever.
very
rigorous
requirements
have
to
be
followed.
but
the
point
that
i
want
to
hammer
home
is
it's
always
done
with
prior
judicial
authorization,
and
that
was...
that
never
came
into
play
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
well,
fingerprints
are
identification-oriented
evidence,
but
the
purpose
of
getting
these
fingerprints
is
to
find
out--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--that's...
under
terry,
that's
what
they're
permitted
to
do.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
that
is
proper
under
terry.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
you
mean
a
printed
copy?
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
well,
you
always
carry
a
copy
with
you,
if
that's
what
you
mean.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
well,
i
suppose
he
could
ask
him
that.
i--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--under
terry
i
question
whether
he
could.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
because,
if
i
can
step
back
about
two
steps
to
a
question
you
asked,
yes,
fingerprints
are
directed
toward
identification,
but
you
may
want
to
identify
people
for
more
than
one
reason.
when
i
went
to
take
the
florida
bar
exam,
i
had
to
be
fingerprinted
so
that
they
could
make
sure
that
i
was
the
michael
raiden
who
had
signed
up
to
take
the
bar
exam,
that
i
didn't
send
somebody
to
take
it
in
my
stead.
in
joe
hayes
they
don't
want
the
fingerprints
just
so
they
can
say
yes,
this
is
the
right
hayes.
they
want
to
identify
joe
hayes
in
this
context
so
that
they
can
convict
him
of
a
crime.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that
in
every
case,
because
it
depends
on
why
he
wants
to
know
if
he's
joe
doaks.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
well--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--when
you're
looking
for
evidence
of
a
crime,
which
in
this
particular
case
the
fingerprints
are,
in
order
to
conduct
a
search
and
a
seizure
for
that
evidence,
you
must
have
prior
judicial
authorization
unless
you
have
a
probable
cause
of
arrest.
you
could
conduct
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
without
previously
getting
a
warrant.
you
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
well,
i
have
argued
that
under
the
phraseology
of
dunaway
that
it
is
tantamount
to
an
arrest,
but
there
was
no
probable
cause.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
i
did
argue
that.
when
he--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--no,
sir.
i'm
not
abandoning
that.
i'm
stressing
that
that
is
one
of
the
differences
between
terry
and
a
case
like
dunaway
is
not
only
do
you
briefly
detain
the
person
on
the
street,
which
under
terry
is
a
seizure--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--under
a
terry
stop,
that's
part
of
what
terry's
designed
to
permit.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
it's
true.
but
terry...
the
evidentiary
value
of
the
firearm
is
incidental
to
the
primary
purpose
for
permitting
that
type
of
pat-down.
the
primary
purpose
is
to
protect
the
officer.
if
he
reasonably
believes
that
person
is
armed,
he
may
then
conduct
that
limited
pat-down
to
protect
himself.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i
believe
the
purpose
of
those
questions...
this
is
what
i've
struggled
with.
the
purpose
of
the
questions
is
to
dispel
the
officer's
suspicion.
now,
what
does
that
mean
exactly
i'm
not
sure,
but--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--i
don't
know
that
he
could
unless...
under
florida
law
we
have
what's
called
the
loitering
and
prowling
statute.
loitering
and
prowling
is
an
individual
crime
with
its
individual
elements.
and
if
the
defendant's
conduct
grows
to
the
level
of
loitering
and
prowling
under
florida
law,
a
florida
officer
could
probably
then
arrest
him
for
that
crime.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
if
it
doesn't
rise
to
that
level,
if
the
person
simply
refuses
to
cooperate
with
the
officer,
i'm
not
sure
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
refuse.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i'm
not
sure
the
officer
can
do
that.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i
don't
believe
he
could
search
him.
i
think
he
can
ask
for
and
ask
who
you
are,
and
part
of
the
reason
he
can
ask
who
he
is
may
be
for
future
reference.
if
the
person
looks
suspicious,
the
officer,
under
terry,
has
a
right
to
detain
him
if
there's
some
reason
to
suspect
there's
criminal
activity
afoot.
and
he
can
ask
him
who
he
is,
and
i
would
assume
would
make
a
report
of
that
perhaps.
but
unless
he
can
connect
this
person
to
a
specific
crime,
he
can't
go
much
beyond
that.
now,
perhaps
later
on
the
officer
might
be
patrolling
that
same
area,
and
maybe
he
would
find
a
broken
window
in
a
business.
well,
then
he's
got
this
person's
name
for
reference.
he
may
be
able
to
go
back
and--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--i
would
say
the
fingerprinting...
i'm...
i'd
say
the
transportation
to
the
station
is
more
serious.
and
that
seems
to
be
the
thread
that
underlies
dunaway
and
royer
and
those
cases.
i
am
eating
into
my
rebuttal
time,
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
last
three
or
four
minutes.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i've
looked
and
looked,
and
i
can't
find
it.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i
hope
i
have
time
to
make--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--i
have
just
one
or
two
points
in
response.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i
hope
i
have
time.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
o'connor,
i
think
your
question
is
a
good
one,
and
i
wonder
if
it
shouldn't
remain
unanswered
at
this
point...
does
the
victim's
i.d.
have
an
independent
source?
i
don't
think
we
can
determine
that.
justice
marshall,
the
way
i
understand
what
happened
in
this
case,
back
to
one
of
your
questions,
he
was
charged
with
three
rapes.
the
investigation
was
concurrent.
he
was
informed
against
jointly,
and
i
think
the
same
evidence
goes
to
all
three.
so
that
he
was
never
convicted
independently.
he
was
never
arrested
three
times.
i
think
he
was
arrested
once
for
all
three.
that's--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--after
this
case
was
tried
and
convicted.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
the--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--that's
not
my
understanding
of
what
happened.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
i
don't
think
that's
what
he
said
either.
they
were
investigating--
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
--i'm
not
sure
there
is
any
point
in
talking
about
them.
they
were
being
investigated
all
at
the
same
time,
and
they
didn't
proceed
with
them.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
that
leads
to
my
last
point.
this
court
said
in
beck
v.
ohio
that
a
trial
judge
cannot
make
an
adequate
probable
cause
determination
if
they're
not
apprised
of
what
the
officers
are
going
on.
now,
they
said
at
one
point
in
the
suppression
hearing
that,
as
i
understood
them
to
say,
the
picture
didn't
look
particularly
like
joe
hayes,
for
one.
for
the
second
part,
they
didn't
bring
those
pictures
in
so
that
the
judge
could
look
at
them
and
decide.
and
i
don't
see
how
the
pictures
help
the
state's
argument
when
the
trial
judge
never
got
to
look
at
them.
in
other
words,
conceivably
they
may
have
had
probable
cause,
but
if
they
did...
and
i
don't
think
they
did...
but
if
they
did,
they
didn't
prove
it.
the
last
point
i
wanted
to
make
regarded
inevitable
discovery.
my
position
would
be
that
is
a
trial
court
determination,
and
i
base
that
on
nix.
the
case
first
came
to
this
court
in
brewer
v.
williams.
the
court
reversed
on
the
basis
of
the
invalid
confession
and
hinted
that
perhaps
inevitable
discovery
might
get
the
body
back
into
evidence.
at
that
time
there
was
a
second
suppression
hearing.
isn't
it
iowa,
isn't
that
the
state?
then...
then
argued
inevitable
discovery
at
the
trial,
and
so
when
it
came
back
to
this
court,
we
had
a
record
whereupon
this
court
could
make
a
determination
if
the
inevitable
discovery
rule
did
apply
in
those
facts.
and
such
is
not
the
case
with
hayes
v.
florida.
mr.
michael
e.
raiden
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
thank
you.
