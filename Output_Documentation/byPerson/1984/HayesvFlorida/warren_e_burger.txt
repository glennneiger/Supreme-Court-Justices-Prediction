chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
hayes
against
florida.
mr.
raiden,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
mr.
raiden,
there's
some
suggestion
in
either
the
briefs
or
somewhere
in
this
record
that
since
they
could
have
taken
the
fingerprints
on
his
front
porch
or
in
his
living
room,
it
made
no
difference
that
they
were
taken
later
in
the
police
station.
would
you
be
here
if
they
had
taken
the
fingerprints
in
his
living
room?
chief
justice
burger
there's
no
difference,
in
your
view.
chief
justice
burger
there's
no
difference.
if
they
took
it
without
his
consent,
as
you
argue,
then
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
took
it
in
his
living
room
or
at
the
police
station.
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
they
would
have
had
to
get
a
warrant
in
order
to
take
the
first
steps.
chief
justice
burger
to
mean
to
relitigate
nix
against
williams?
chief
justice
burger
well,
what
possible...
what
possible
flaw
could
there
be
in
the
identification--
chief
justice
burger
--if
in
open
court
she
identified
him
as
the
attacker?
chief
justice
burger
but
on
a
terry
stop,
could
the
policeman,
if
he
found
a
gun,
take
the
gun
away
from
the
man?
chief
justice
burger
and
that
might
well...
that
might
well
be
evidence,
first,
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon
without
a
license
or,
second,
if
they
took
some
ballistic
tests,
it
might
tie
him
to
a
murder.
so
it's
very,
very
important
evidence,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
munsey.
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
he
wasn't
arrested--
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
he
wasn't
legally
arrested,
arrested
as
a
matter
of
law
when
they
took
him
away
from
his
home,
he
certainly
was
arrested
as
soon
as
they
took
the
fingerprints.
chief
justice
burger
were
these
second
charges
brought
after
his
fingerprinting
in
the
case
now
before
us?
chief
justice
burger
--well,
then
you're
saying
that
this
court
is
not
bound
by
the
state
court's
determination
on
this
issue
because
it's
a
federal
issue?
chief
justice
burger
and
that
you
argue
here
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
argument
here
is
that
this
would
have
been
inevitably
discovered
in
any
event
under
the
nix
case,
and
therefore
we're
spinning
our
wheels
up
here,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
the
way
i
understood
his
argument.
otherwise,
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
talking
about
these
null
prossed
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
your
friend
is
right
on
his
theory
that
there
was
probable
cause
at
the
time
they
went
to
the
man's
home,
then
the
inevitable
discovery
claim
evaporates
from
the
case,
is
that
not
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
ball
against
the
united
states.
