but
aren't
those
statutes
for
the
most
part
based
on
no
more
than
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
there's
some
problem
with
those
statutes;
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
it
is
valid
within
the
terry
stop
rationale
to
take
a
photograph
of
someone
on
the
street
when
you
make
a
voluntary
stop
and
use
that
in
evidence?
justice
o'connor
does
that
violate
any
right
of
privacy,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
a
fingerprint
any
different
than
your
face?
it's
just
a
different
form
of
identification
like
your
physiognomy
generally.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
talking
about
a
terry
stop.
within
a
terry
stop
the
court
has
allowed
a
pat-down
search
of
the
person,
which
perhaps
is
more
intrusive
than
taking
a
photograph
or
a
fingerprint.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
it
more
intrusive...
do
you
think
it's
more
intrusive
than
taking
a
fingerprint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
have
to
place
your
hands
on
a
person
to
do
a
pat-down
search,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
also
held
that
it's
valid
to
ascertain
identity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
isn't
the
taking
of
fingerprint
a
form
of
identification
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
decision
announced
by
this
court
yesterday
in
hensley
permitted
a
terry-type
stop
just
for
identification
purposes
based
on
a
flyer.
now,
if
fingerprinting
on
the
scene
were
used
for
identification,
how
does
that
differ?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
not
correct.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why,
if
it's
valid
to
make
that
kind
of
a
stop
to
check
on
identification,
would
it
be
invalid
to
go
ahead
and
print
someone
at
the
scene
of
the
terry-type
stop?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course,
in
this
case
the
individual
was
taken
to
the
station,
and
you
don't
have
the
typical
terry-type
on
the
scene
stop.
let
me
ask
you,
if
i
may,
suppose
we
agree
with
you
that
taking
the
individual
to
the
station
was
not
valid
with
the
terry
stop
rationale.
as
i
understand
it,
the
victim
made
a
later
in
court
identification
of
the
defendant
in
this
case.
now,
even
if
you're
correct
that
taking
the
defendant
to
the
station
was
invalid,
on
retrial
do
you
think
that
the
state
can
get
another
set
of
prints
and
introduce
fingerprint
evidence
again
on
retrial
to
convict
this
person?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
think
that
it's
important
to
explore
a
bit.
is
there
probable
cause
now
to
obtain
a
warrant
to
take
this
person's
fingerprints?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
faced
with
this
record,
is
there
now
probable
cause
to
get
the...
mr.
hayes'
fingerprints?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
that's
the
case,
what
possible
use
is
there
in
ordering
a
new
trial
just
to
consider
the
exact
same
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
no
objection
made
to
her
in
court
identification?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
just
one
i'd
like
to
ask,
if
i
may.
does
the
record
tell
us
how
long
mr.
hayes
was
kept
at
the
station
and
how
long
it
took
to
get
him
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
munsey,
may
i
ask
what
the
point
of
all
this
discussion
of
the
evidence
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what...
what
relevance
does
that
have
to
the
point
that
you
want
to
make?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
c.i.
being
a
confidential
informant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
point
of
this?
what
is
the
legal
relevance
of
all
of
this
discussion
of
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
you're
trying
to
argue
here
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
saying
there
was
no
probable
cause,
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
want
us
to
reweigh
the
evidence
and
disagree
with
the
court
below
and
find
there's
probable
cause?
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
reason
why
prints
couldn't
be
taken
at
the
scene
or
at
a
suspect's
home?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
involved...
just
an
ink
pad
and
a
piece
of
paper?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
didn't
you
just
roll
your
finger
on
an
ink
pad
and
put
it
on
a
piece
of
paper?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
quite
apart
from
inevitable
discovery,
is
it
arguable
that
no
new
trial
is
required
simply
to
present
the
same
evidence
all
over
again?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--wasn't
her
in
court
identification
based
on
her
view
of
the
defendant
at
the
scene
of
the
rape?
