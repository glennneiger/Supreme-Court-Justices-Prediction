mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
and
mr.
chief
justice:
justice
o'connor,
in
answer
to
your
question,
the
record
does
not
reflect
either
the
amount
of
time
of
the
detention
or
how
far
it
took
to
transport
him.
if
this
court
is
interested,
i
have
spoken
with
detective
gandy,
and
i
would
be
happy
to
share
that
information,
but
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
yes,
they
did.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
we
had--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--no.
they
arrested
him.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
well--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--he
was--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--up
until...
up
until
he
was
formally
arrested,
he
had
been
detained
for
30
minutes,
and
it
was--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
as
soon
as
officer
cardell
of
the
sheriff's
department
made
that
match,
then
he
was
what
i
would
call
formally
arrested.
the
other
answer
to
your
question
was
the
distance
between
mr.
hayes'
residence
and
the
punta
gorda
police
station,
whether
it's
not
in
the
record,
was
one
mile.
i
think
in
this
case
and
what
has
bothered
me
and
both
mr.
raiden
with
the
case
has
been
the
dry
record
of
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing.
and
you
read
that
and
the
appendix,
and
you
keep
wondering
why
the
police
went
to
mr.
hayes'
home,
what
was
their
reason
in
going
there,
why
did
they
think
that
he
was
the
rapist.
everything
is
very
disjointed
in
that.
i
have
a
finding
of
the
second
district
court
of
appeal
that
i
stand
here
in
front
of
you
today
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
well,
let's
look
at
the
reasonable
suspicion.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
and
invite
the
court
to
look
at
that
reasonable
suspicion
in
concert
with
the
trial
testimony
joined
with
the
testimony
at
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing.
now,
what
did
the
police
have?
we
have
the
punta
gorda
police
investigating
three
rapes,
and
we
have
the
rape
of
velora
davis,
a
woman
aged
82.
you
can
get
that
at
the
sentencing
hearing
at
r-741
where
her
case
was
null
prossed.
and
the
second
rape
of
helen
smith,
aged
60.
the
case
against
mr.
hayes
where
mrs.
smith
was
a
victim
was
also
null
prossed
at
record
741.
police
had
interviewed
these
victims,
and
they
had
gotten
a
composite
photograph...
not
a
photograph
but
a
composite
representation
of
what
he
looked
like,
a
composite
portrait,
and
they
had
gotten
a
composite
from
julienne
hollander
and
another
composite
from...
it
was
either
ms.
davis
or
ms.
smith.
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that
in
the
trial.
and
this
composite
had
been
published
in
the
local
newspaper.
now,
what
is
alluded
to
in
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing?
you
have
one
question,
and
that's
at
the
joint
appendix
page
11
by
mr.
bader
where
he's
cross
examining
detective
shoup,
and
he
said,
"did
any
informant
tell
you
they
knew
of
their
personal
knowledge
that
he
had
perpetrated
any
of
the
alleged
crimes?
"
and
detective
shoup
answers,
"not
myself".
remember,
there
are
two
investigators,
two
detectives,
shoup
and
gandy.
at
the
trial,
and
that's
record--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--excuse
me.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
yes,
sir--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--no.
he
was
not
arrested
on
smith
and
davis.
they
had
charges
against
him
for
davis
and
smith
after
he
was
arrested
on
hollander.
that's
the
case
before
the
court
now.
there's
three
rapes.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
i
would
presume
that
he
was
for
the
state
to
go
ahead
and
null
prosse--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--the
rape
of
velora
davis
was
april
27th,
of
helen
smith
was
may
18th,
and
of
julienne
hollander
was
may
13th.
the
first
arrest
and
seizure
or
the
arrest
and
seizure
of
mr.
hayes
was
on
june
23rd
when
they...
when
they
finally
seized
his
prints.
now,
they
are
trying--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--that
is
what
i
presume
from
the
record.
this
is
the
only
mention
that
we
have
of
ms.
davis
and
ms.
smith
is
at
sentencing.
and
this
is
one
reason
that
i...
and
judge
adams
reads
into
the
record
as
to
why
he
is
retaining
one
jurisdiction
over
one
third
of
the
sentencing
is
these
prior
rapes.
and
at
that
point
in
time,
because
he
did
get
such
an
lengthy
sentence,
the
state
attorney
null
prosses
the
cases
against
mr.
hayes
with
ms.
davis
and
ms.
smith,
and
judge
adams
says
on
the
record,
he
says
he
doesn't
want
these
ladies
to
go
through
the
humiliating,
degrading
experience
that
ms.
hollander
had
to
go
through
in
her
trial.
when
you
look
at
the
trial
record
and
detective
shoup
is
testifying,
mr.
bader,
defense
counsel,
says
to
him,
asks
him,
mr.
shoup,
did
any>
["]...
and
i'm
at
record
528...
"did
anyone
whisper
in
your
ear,
did
anyone
tell
you
joe
hayes
might
be
the
one?
"
"no,
sir,
not
to
me.
"
"well,
did
you
get
a
whisper
through
mr.
gandy?
"
answer:
"yes,
i
did".
question:
mr.
gandy>
["]?
"yes,
sir".
and
at
that
point
in
time
detective
shoup
goes
into
the
fact
that
he
didn't
know
the
name
of
detective
gandy's
confidential
informant,
and
regretfully,
when
detective
gandy
takes
the
stand
at
trial,
mr.
bader
does
not
ask
mr....
detective
gandy
about
his
confidential
informant.
detective
gandy
is
not
asked
at
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing
or
at
trial
who
the
c.i.
was,
was
he
reliable--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--well--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--okay.
when
they'd
run
the
photograph
in
the
newspaper,
the
composite,
the
c.i.
comes
forward.
the
c.i.
tells
detective
gandy.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
confidential
informant.
and
says
it's
joe
hayes.
at
that
point
in
time
through
the
record
detective
gandy
goes
forward
and
on
a
pretext
goes
up
to
mr.
hayes'
home,
knocks
on
the
door,
sees
those
herringbone
shoes,
and
does
a
pretext
interview,
and
then
walks
away.
at
that
time
he
finds
out
that
joe
hayes
works
at
the
home
care
center.
he
goes
to
the
home
care
center
with
a
subpoena
ducas
tecum
from
the
state
attorney's
office...
now,
this
is
from
the
trial
record...
and
gets
his
personnel
file.
he
interviews
the
co-workers.
he
gets...
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing,
you
will
see
that
they
talked--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--okay.
that
they
had
reasonable
suspicion.
and
i
argued
in
the
second
district,
justice
o'connor,
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
do
the
arrest.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
i...
yes,
your
honor.
and
i'm
saying--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--well,
what
i...
i
don't
want
you
to
substitute
the
judgment
of
the
second
district,
but
i
am
saying
that
the
second
district
applied
an
incorrect
constitutional
standard
to
probable
cause,
as
this
court
has
announced
in--
--illinois
v.
gates.
this
is
an
alternate
constitutional
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
i
do,
your
honor.
i
do.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
yes.
right
now.
your
honor,
the
other
alternate
constitutional
ground
is
inevitable
discovery.
before
i
forget,
on
record
741,
other
than
the
in
court
testimony
of
julienne
hollander,
we
have
judge
adams
as
he
passes
sentence
stating
that
joe
hayes
is
subject
to
an
outstanding
warrant
by
law
enforcement
agencies
in
other
jurisdictions
in
connection
with
similar
crimes...
the
west
german
federal
republic.
that's
at
record
751.
i
would
proffer
to
the
court
that
the
state
of
florida
does
have
those
fingerprints.
so
there
are
two
prongs,
two
approaches
that
florida
can
take
and
have
those
fingerprints
if
free
trial
is
necessary.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
sure--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
correct.
we
have
a
detention,
investigative
detentions
must
be
temporary
and
last
no
longer
than
necessary
to
effect
the
purpose
of
the
stop.
the
purpose
of
this
stop
was
to
take
mr.
hayes'
fingerprints.
the
state
of
florida
did
everything
reasonable.
we
had
officer
cardell
of
the
charlotte
county
sheriff's
office
on
standby
at
the
police
department
ready
to
roll
those
prints.
now,
where
the
government
has
been
in
trouble
was
the...
the
case
of
united
states
v.
place,
and
that's
where
luggage
was
seized
and
90
minutes
elapsed.
and
it
was
alluded
to
that
perhaps
the
government
should
have
had
some
dogs
ready
to
sniff.
well,
that's
not
a
problem
in
this
case.
we
have
someone
competent,
willing,
ready
and
able
to
compare
those
fingerprints,
and
they
were
compared.
the
purpose
of
his
detention
was
to
take
his
fingerprints.
the
fingerprints
were
taken.
we
tried
to
be...
we
didn't
intrude
upon
his
rights
any
more
than
was
reasonably
necessary.
i
think
it
makes
no--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--only
the
economics
of
the
punta
gorda
police
department.
i
don't
believe
they
have
mobile
fingerprint
kits.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
that
might
be
all
that
is
involved,
justice
o'connor.
when
i've
been
fingerprinted
for
the
bar
examination,
i
remember
it
was
a--
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
--it
was
a
big...
it
was
a
stable
thing,
but
i
imagine
that
is
all
that...
correct.
you're
correct.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
the
greater
intrusion
would
be
the
transportation.
the
fingerprints...
the
taking
of
the
fingerprints
you
aren't
asking
questions,
you're
not
probing
into
their
life.
there
is
a
bit
of
a
chill
in
transporting
someone.
although,
on
balance,
in
defending
the...
the...
the
detention
and
transporting
of
mr.
hayes,
on
the
other
side
of
that,
i
don't
know
how
i
would
feel
if
on
my
front
porch
of
my
home
if
a
policeman
is
there,
and
my
neighbors
are
looking,
and
i'm
being
fingerprinted
on
my
front
porch,
or
whether
it
is
not
a
bit
more
acceptable
to
go
with
plainclothes
policemen.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
and
if...
if
they
weren't
invited,
we
do
have
problems.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
well,
it's
both
a
seizure
and
a
fingerprint
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
under
inevitable
discovery
and
with
nix
v.
williams...
and
mr.
raiden
had
said
that
i
raise
inevitable
discovery
for
the
first
time
here.
i
find
myself
in
a
similar
position
that
new
york
v.
quarles
was
in.
i
believe
new
york
raised
inevitable
discovery
the
first
time
here.
but
remember,
new
york
was
petitioner,
and
florida
is
respondent;
and
i
believe
i'm
allowed
to
defend
the
judgment
on
any
grounds
that
the
record
might
well
permit.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
a
retrial
is
necessary,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
this
court
could
well
conclude
on
this
record
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
go
ahead
and
re-arrest
mr.
hayes
on
the
basis
of
julienne
hollander's
testimony
at
trial,
and
why
do
a
futile
effort.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
true.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
well,
her
identification
certainly
antedates
the
fingerprinting,
the
arrest.
her
identification
stems
back
from
the
time
that
she
was
raped
in
her
home
and
rolled
over
on
her
elbow
and
took
a
look
at
joe
hayes.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
well,
that's
where
her
identification
came
from.
that's
the
source
of
her...
of
her
identification
was
the
rape
itself.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
i.
munsey,
jr.
that
is
the
only
place
that
she
viewed
him.
she
did...
there
was
a
photographic
display
shown
to
her
after
the
arrest,
but
there
was
no...
there
was
no
hint
or
suggestion
of
a
taint
to
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
