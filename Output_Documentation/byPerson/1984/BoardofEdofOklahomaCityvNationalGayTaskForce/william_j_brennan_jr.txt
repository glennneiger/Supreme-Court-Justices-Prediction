does
oklahoma
have
a
certification
statute?
justice
jr.
have
you
put
a
copy
of
it
in
there?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
thank
you.
justice
jr.
i
suppose
certification
is
not
the
same
thing
as
abstention.
justice
jr.
suppose
a
teacher
sat
down
at
lunch
with
a
number
of
other
teachers
and
said,
i
wish
they'd
leave
these
homosexuals
alone,
they
are
not
hurting
anyone
except
themselves,
and
that
was
heard
by
everybody
in
the
room,
students
and
everybody
else.
justice
jr.
would
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
jr.
that
wouldn't
be
encouraging
homosexual
activity?
justice
jr.
how
do
we
know
your
state
court
would
think
that?
justice
jr.
this
isn't
tennessee.
this
is
oklahoma.
justice
jr.
the
claim
here
is
that
this
statute
is
overbroad,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
and
if
my
hypothetical
is
one
that
would
be
reached
by
it,
it
would
be
overbroad,
wouldn't
it?
justice
jr.
mr.
tribe,
i
notice
you
haven't
cited
in
re
sawyer.
don't
you
get
any
comfort
from
this?
justice
jr.
that
was
where
the
lawyer
criticized
the
smith
act.
