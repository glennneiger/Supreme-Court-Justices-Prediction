mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
writing
for
the
california
supreme
court
nearly
a
decade
ago,
the
late
justice
tobriner
recognized
that
the
modern
struggle
for
homosexual
rights
in
this
country
is
truly
a
struggle
for
civil
rights,
and
he
said,
like
other
such
struggles,
it
incites
heated
political
debate.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
how
open
that
debate
will
be,
and
it
was
in
addressing
that
issue
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
oklahoma's
teacher
fitness
law
is
unconstitutional,
and
i
quote,
"insofar
as
it
punishes
advocating,
encouraging,
or
promoting
public
or
private
homosexual
activity.
"
the
latter
term,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
not
even
being
defined.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
he
would
have
said
that
the
right
advocate
change
in
those
laws,
to
express
therefore
misgivings
about
the
views
they
take,
is
a
fundamental
protected
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
right
to
decriminalize
anything.
that
is,
those
who
advocated
violent
overthrow
of
the
government,
as
long
as
they
didn't
incite
imminently
to
it,
were
exercising
protected
first
amendment
rights.
it
is
not
how
much
we
disagree
with
the
view,
but
whether
it
imminently
incites.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose
if
a
teacher
were
foolish
enough
to
say,
you
know,
i
think
these
murder
laws
are
silly,
i
think,
to
use
justice
brennan's
example,
murder
is
really
a
pretty
good
idea,
that
teacher
would
probably
be
civilly
committable,
but
i
doubt
that
that
teacher
would
be
violating...
that
teacher
would
be
going
across
the
brandenburg
line.
the
brandenburg
line
does
not
depend
on
how
silly
or
how
disagreeable
the
view
is.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
however
long
the
list,
the
principle
for
which
this
case,
i
think,
ought
to
stand
is
that
if
one
is
simply
expressing
misgivings
about
the
law,
whether
sub
silentio
or
expressly,
one
should
not
be
punished.
for
example,
justice
stewart
about
25
years
ago
in
a
case
also
involving
trying
to
make
what
was
then
criminal
activity,
sex
outside
of
marriage,
appear
attractive,
in
the
case
of
kingsley
pictures,
made
clear
that
the
right
to
make
what
was
then
a
crime
seem
perfectly
normal
and
attractive
was
a
form
of
protected
advocacy
every
bit
as
much,
he
said,
as
advocacy
of
socialism
or
the
single
tax.
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
lines
they
are
attempting
to
draw,
though
perhaps
responsive
to
the
chief
justice's
concern,
are
lines
not
drawable
at
all.
it
was
this
court
that
recognized
in
wrightman
v.
mulkie
about
a
decade
before
oklahoma's
law
was
passed
that
the
repeal
of
any
legal
prohibition
may
be
said
to
encourage
the
activity
formerly
prohibited.
so,
the
result
is
that
if
someone
says,
i
am
in
favor
of
repeal
of
the
sodomy
laws,
or
i
believe
we
should
pass
gay
rights
laws,
that
person
could
obviously
be
said
to
encourage
homosexual
activity,
and
that
is
not
an
abstract
matter.
the
abstract
discussion
would
subject
that
teacher
to
this
entire
statutory
scheme
in
which
there
are
so
many
uncertainties,
and
what
it
means
is
concrete.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
is
threatening
every
day,
which
is
why--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no
particular
individual
has
asked,
but
because
the
chilling
effect
is
so
thorough...
there
is
no
question
in
this
record.
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
members
of
the
gay
task
force,
not
third
parties
but
members
of
the
plaintiff,
are
afraid
openly
to
discuss
homosexuality.
the
attorney
general
of
oklahoma
says
that
the
reason
this
statute
should
be
kept
on
the
books
is
that
they
have
a
right
to
get
rid
of
gay
rights
activities.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
because
they
are
all--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--you
are
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
there
is
no
allegation
that
it
has
ever
been
applied.
in
that
sense,
this
case
is
on
all
fours
with
pecunier
v.
martinez,
involving
prison
censorship,
never
applied,
but
the
scheme
held
invalid
by
this
court--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
in
poe
v.
ullman,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice,
the
issue
of
ripeness
was
a
serious
one.
here
the
allegation
is
that
these
teachers
are
ready
to
discuss
this
issue
now
but
are
afraid
to
do
so.
when
summary
judgment
was
entered,
it
was
entered
on
a
stipulation
saying
that
there
was
no
genuine
dispute
of
fact.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
because
the
allegation
is
that
they
were
afraid
to
test
it.
justice
rehnquist,
i--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
if
you
have
to
nudge
yourself
right
up
against
it
and
risk
your
job
to
challenge
it,
then
this
court,
i
think,
clearly
has
to
overrule
baggett
v.
bullitt
and
paishe.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
they
could
have
taken
the
oath,
but
then
you
see
their
argument
was,
the
argument
of
the
other
side
was,
it
is
perfectly
harmless
to
take
the
oath.
all
you
have
to
do
is
then
never
cross
the
forbidden
line,
and
it
could
have
been
said
then,
no
one
was
ever
threatened
with
being
pushed
over
the
cliff,
and
the
answer
was,
because
they
were
afraid
to
get
close
to
the
line.
this
court,
i
think,
has
made
clear
in,
for
example,
not
only
pecunier,
which
applied
to
prisoners,
but
virginia
board
of
pharmacy,
which
applied
in
the
commercial
speech
context,
that
if
a
law
is
void
on
its
face
and
controls
pure
speech,
then
you
needn't
push
the
authorities
into
applying
it
to
you
before
you
get
a
facial
test
of
it.
surely
that
principle,
that
there
can
be
anticipatory
attacks
on
laws
that
facially
invalidly
regulate
speech
can't
be
limited
to
prisoners
and
commercial
speech.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
defendant
was
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
oklahoma.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
has
a
full
statutory
obligation,
justice
white,
to
enforce
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
there
appears
to
have
been
none.
that
is
why
they
were
the
ones
who
were
sued
rather
than
any
other
state
officer.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
the
complaint
alleged
it,
and
that
was,
in
fact,
among
the
things
that
the
defendants
admitted
rather
than
questioning.
but
i
think
we
can
come
close
to
the
specific
threat
justice
rehnquist
wants
if
we
go
back
a
little
in
time
to
february
12th,
1981,
when
there
was
a
colloquy
between
counsel
for
the
board
of
education
and
counsel
for
the
national
gay
task
force
before
the
district
court
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
exactly
the
ground
that
you
are
raising,
justice
rehnquist.
at
that
point,
the
position
of
the
board
was,
you
guys
are
free
to
discuss
anything
you
want
as
long
as
you
don't
cross
this
line
that
we
understand,
that
is,
as
long
as
you
don't
intentionally
urge
anyone
to
go
out
and
commit
criminal
sodomy.
counsel
for
plaintiff,
the
national
gay
task
force,
then
said,
fine,
we
will
drop
this
entire
lawsuit
if
the
board
enters
into
a
binding
decree,
a
binding
consent
decree
restricting
the
law's
enforcement
to
that
extent.
in
other
words,
remove
the
threat.
well,
counsel
for
the
board
perhaps
was
nonplussed.
he
said,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
do
that.
i
am
working
for
a
political
body.
and
then
he
refused.
this
is
in
volume
3
of
the
court
of
appeals
record,
at
pages
24,
34,
and
40.
so
that
the
oklahoma
law
itself
on
its
face
continues
to
threaten
protected
speech
across
the
full
range
of
the
law's
literal
reach.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
certainly
don't
agree
with
any
narrow
interpretation
i
have
heard
before.
the
one
described
today
is
a
little
hard
for
me
to
follow.
he
says
in
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question,
what
if
a
teacher
says,
perhaps
in
a
discussion
with
fellow
employees
or
let
say
at
a
pta
meeting,
or
on
a
local
talk
show,
i
wish
they'd
leave
these
homosexuals
alone,
they
are
not
hurting
anybody
else,
would
that
teacher
then
be
subject
to
immediate
suspension
while
they
tried
to
figure
out
what
this
law
meant?
and
i
think
with
commendable
candor
counsel
was
really
unable
to
answer.
he
said,
well,
maybe
that
is
a
kind
of
sub
silentio
advocacy
of
repeal.
well,
if
all
they
are
talking
about
is
soliciting
homosexual
activity,
or
imposing
it,
i
think
it
is
very
clear
from
the
opinion
below
that
teachers
even
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
still
be
fired
for
soliciting
or
imposing.
they
are
obviously
talking
about
expressing
the
point
of
view
that
homosexual
activity
shouldn't
be
made
subject
to
criminal
laws,
that
homosexuals
shouldn't
be
harassed
or
stigmatized.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
marshall,
i
would
love
to
have
the
state
do
that
if
it
could
be
done
in
a
single
plausible
construction,
but
this
court
has--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
in
fact
this
court
itself
could
certify
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma,
and
that
would
surely
be
better
than
making
us
start
from
the
beginning,
but
let
me
ask
this
court
to
think
about--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--why
would
that
be
better?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
because
this
court
has
held
about
eight
times
that
the
high
cost
of
keeping
the
chilling
effect
of
this
kind
of
law
in
place
while
someone
is
dragged
through
another
judicial
system
is
not
worth
paying.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
no,
we
filed
this
case
for
the
purpose
of
being
able
to
speak
freely.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
i
say
it
would
be
better
to
send
it
back
than
make
us
go
through
from
the
word
go.
but
let's
think
about
what
would
happen
if
you
sent
it
back.
what
would
you
ask
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma?
would
you
give
them
a
multiple--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
if
the
question
is
that
open-ended,
i
would
hate
to
serve
on
that
state
supreme
court.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
after
you
hear
the
argument
you
might
know,
if
you
agree
with
me,
that
there
is
no
finite
list
of
questions
that
would
help,
because
the
very
questions
already
asked
from
this
bench,
i
think
what
we
got
was
an
example
of
the
draconian
chilling
confusion
caused
by
this
law.
for
example,
justice
o'connor
asked,
what
about
that
first
criterion?
must
there
be
likelihood
of
adverse
effect?
and
then
counsel
invented
the
childers
case,
which
i
guess...
i
have
read
the
case.
it
is
not
in
the
briefs.
the
case
deals
with
an
interpretation
of
the
sodomy
law,
not
of
this
law.
as
they
say,
this
law
has
never
been
interpreted
because
it
has
never
been
applied,
because
its
chilling
effect
is
so
severe.
then
they
turn
to
a
tennessee
case.
the
fact
is
that
if
you
just
read
the
statute,
all
it
says
is,
certain
factors
shall
be
considered.
it
doesn't
say
any
of
them
must
be
present.
and
then,
what
is
the
meaning
of
adverse
effect?
that
is,
embarrassment
by
fellow
teachers
is
obviously
not
to
be
desired.
that
is
an
adverse
effect.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
might
write
a
1,000-page
essay.
well,
by
adverse
effect,
it
has
got
to
be
very
adverse.
it
might
try
to
tell
you
what
that
meant.
but
the
whole
theme
of
many
of
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
certification
as
well
as
abstention
is
that
when
a
law
is
so
broad
and
sweeping
in
its
chill
of
protected
discussion
that
you
couldn't
get
a
simple,
clear,
single
definition
of
just
how
far
it
reaches,
not
in
a
long
series
of
adjudications,
which
might
never
occur
because
of
the
chilling
effect
of
the
law--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--of
course,
even
the
board
of
education
concedes
that
if
it
comes
anywhere
close
to
advocating
repeal,
it
ought
to
be
protected,
but
remember,
when
they
were
asked
to
narrow
the
law's
enforcement
to
that
extent,
in
february
of
1981,
they
refused.
actually,
this
court
has
dealt
with
problems
rather
like
that
in
a
case
called
thomas
v.
collins,
the
leading
case
back
in
1945.
it
was
common
ground
in
that
case
that
it
is
not
protected
discussion
for
a
union
organizer
actually
to
solicit
members
in
the
union
without
first
getting
some
kind
of
union
card.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
protected
just
to
extol
the
virtues
of
unionism.
the
problem
in
that
case
and
the
conclusion
of
the
court
was
that
when
a
speaker
has
to
worry
on
pain
of
some
concrete
penalty
if
he
guesses
wrong
whether
others
will
take
his
words
of
praise
for
unionism,
like
justice
brennan's
example,
what
is
so
wrong
with
what
these
gay
people
do,
whether
others
will
take
those
words
of
praise
as
an
impermissible
encouragement
to
join
up,
then
the
freedom
of
speech
is
fatally
abridged.
and
i
think
the
fundamental
teaching
of
this
court's
cases
all
the
way
back
from
thomas
in
'45
to
baggett
and
paishian
is
that
the
first
amendment
forbids
forcing
speakers
to
walk
across
that
kind
of
tightrope
even
if
the
state,
promises
that
it
might
supply
some
kind
of
safety
net
if
they
should
happen
to
fall.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
certainly
can
be
taken
into
account,
but
when
president
reagan
editorialized
against
this
very
law
in
california,
about
six
years
ago,
his
answer
to
the
role
model
point
was,
first
of
all,
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
homosexuality
is
something
like
a
contagious
disease.
he
quoted
a
woman
who
said
that
if
teachers
had
all
that
much
power
as
role
models,
i
would
have
been
a
nun
many
years
ago.
his
point
really
was,
this
role
model
business
can
be
taken
only
so
far,
and
this
court
itself
said
in
ambach
against
norwich,
recognizing
teachers
are
role
models,
yes,
and
we
can
make
them
be
citizens,
yes,
but
in
footnote
10
this
court
said,
of
course,
we
are
not
saying
you
can
muzzle
them,
we
are
not
saying
you
can
tell
them
what
to
discuss.
and
this
court
in
abood
versus
the
detroit
board
of
education
not
very
long
ago
expressly
held
that
although
they
are
role
models,
public
school
teachers
have
first
amendment
rights
every
bit
as
broad
as
private
citizens
when
they
talk
on
matters
of
public
interest,
whether
they
are
talking
politics
or
philosophy
or
ethics
or
social
change.
now,
recognizing
that
teachers
are
role
models
does
not
mean
that
the
first
amendment--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right,
justice
rehnquist,
but
one
of
the
conclusions
in
abood,
i
think,
would
simply
that
if
the
teacher's
union
to
which
teachers
had
to
contribute
began
engaging
in
lobbying,
saying
we
should
tighten
up
the
laws
against
gay
activity,
then
a
teacher
would
be
free
to
withhold
her
dues.
and
surely
if
she
is
free
to
withhold
her
dues,
she
is
free
to
explain
at
a
pta
meeting
or
in
a
newspaper
why
she
is
withholding
her
dues,
and
if
she
quotes
justice
brennan
and
says,
i
am
withholding
my
dues
because
i
think
that
being
gay,
though
right
now
it
is
a
crime,
oughtn't
to
be,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it,
then
that
teacher
runs
afoul
of
this
law,
because
that
could
be
said
to
encourage.
and
this
case,
too,
doesn't
involve
a
classroom
situation.
that
is,
in
no
way
do
we
challenge
the
power
of
oklahoma
to
prescribe
a
curriculum.
in
no
way
do
we
challenge
the
power
of
oklahoma
to
direct
what
may
be
included
in
class.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
of
course,
that
would
be
subsumed
in
this
case,
but
this
case
goes
way
beyond
class.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
sure
there
are,
justice
white,
and
i
would...
let
me
give
you
an
example.
suppose--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
in
a
math
class--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
would
conflict
with
the
curriculum
rules.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think,
justice
white,
i
would
probably
urge
that,
but
we
don't
have
to
prevail
on
that
view
for
this
law
to
be
struck
down.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
but
even
in
class,
justice
white,
suppose
during
a
recess
a
child
runs
in
and
says,
what
should
i
do,
i
just
saw
these
kids
ganging
up
on
johnny,
they
claim
johnny
is
gay.
this
law
is
in
effect.
the
teacher
is
in
a
dilemma.
on
the
one
hand,
the
teacher
could
say
nothing,
and
encourage
disrespect
for
fellow
students.
on
the
other
hand,
the
teacher
can
say
something
sympathetic
to
johnny,
who
is
thought
to
be
gay.
the
moment
the
teacher
does
that,
then
as
president
reagan
said
when
he
opposed
this
law,
someone
may
be
listening,
and
the
teacher
may
be
in
trouble.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
chiding
or
perhaps
beating
up
on.
that
is,
the
experience
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
not
been
a
happy
one.
there
have
been
violent
episodes
against
homosexuals,
and
in
light
of
those
violent
episodes,
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
law
has
had
so
chilling
an
effect.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
chilling
effect,
justice
marshall,
is
in
the
record.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
is
right.
i
think
the
court--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
court
may
just
have
to
take
notice
of
some
realities.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
nor
is
it
necessary
to
our
case
that
we
talk
about
that.
i
am
simply
trying
to
put
this
case
in
context.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
will
do
that,
justice
marshall.
and
with
respect
to
the
record
in
this
case,
if
i
might
go
back
to
the
idea
that
these
nexus
requirements
might
somehow
save
the
law,
either
the
way
they
are
written
or
the
way
they
might
be
construed
if
this
court
were
to
certify
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
key
to
that
is
justice
white's
question
about
whether
all
of
these
factors
might
somehow
be
collapsed
into
nothing
through
that
magic
word,
"unfit",
because
if
you
really
had
to
find
that
word,
independent
of
the
viewpoint
the
teacher
expressed,
the
teacher
was
independently
unfit
to
teach,
in
terms
of
general
background
and
otherwise
valid
fitness
rules,
then
of
course
this
law
would
be
entirely
superfluous
except
for
one
important
factor.
and
that
is
that
under
this
law
there
is
a
new
basis
and
an
important
basis
for
chilling
all
speech
that
comes
anywhere
close
to
the
line,
and
that
is
in
section
6103.3
of
the
statute,
which
is
very
much
in
this
record.
whenever
a
superintendent
of
a
school
district
has
reason
to
believe
that
cause
exists
for
dismissal,
then
the
teacher
can
be
suspended
without
even
a
hearing
while
one
tries
to
figure
out
whether
the
teacher
is
unfit
within
the
meaning
of
this
law,
and
then
when
you
look
at
this
law,
what
does
it
tell
you?
it
says
that
a
teacher
may
be
discharged
if
the
teacher
has
been
rendered
unfit
because
of
such
conduct
or
activity.
conduct
is
in
turn
defined
as
speech.
in
other
words,
you
can
be
rendered
unfit
simply
because
the
point
of
view
you
express
might
directly
or
indirectly
encourage
homosexual
activity.
now,
it
is
suggested
by
mr.
arrow
that
we
are
somehow
guilty
of
reading
the
word
"indirectly"
into
this
law
to
make
it
look
broader.
on
the
contrary,
when
they
were
invited
before
the
district
court
to
narrow
the
law
by
reading
the
word
"directly"
into
it
and
an
intent
requirement
into
it,
to
eliminate
the
directly
threatened
enforcement
of
the
law
as
it
now
stood,
they
declined
that
invitation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
problem
is,
i
suppose,
counsel
couldn't
even
promise
not
to
enforce
it.
that
is,
he
surely
couldn't
amend
it--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
certainly
don't
mean
to
be
doing
that.
i
am
suggesting,
however,
that
if
in
this
court
he
tells
us
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
that
there
is
no
real
threat
of
enforcement
against
people
who
merely
discuss,
he
certainly
had
the
power
to
eliminate
that
threat
by
entering
into
a
consent
decree.
but
as
justice
white
points
out,
this
law
is
essentially
self-executing.
they
have
no
discretion
about
its
enforcement.
if
you
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
a
public
school
teacher
in
oklahoma
either
before
the
tenth
circuit
acted
or
after
this
court
might
send
the
case
back
on
certification
to
the
oklahoma
supreme
court,
and
if
you
ask
yourself,
must
i
hedge
and
trim
every
word
i
utter
on
this
controversial
public
subject,
because
otherwise
i
will
be
suspended
and
i
might
ultimately
be
discharged,
your
answer
is
surely
yes.
that
is,
this
law,
by
virtue
of
the
threat
that
is
on
its
face
reinforced
by
the
sweeping
interpretation
given
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
this
law
in
effect
tells
teachers,
you
had
better
shut
up
about
this
subject,
or
if
you
talk
about
it,
you
had
better
be
totally
hostile
to
homosexuals.
and
the
real
question
is
whether
it
is
consistent
with
the
traditions
of
free
speech
and
open
inquiry
for
that
lesson
to
be
given.
you
asked,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
the
role
model
function
of
teachers,
and
i
do
take
that
seriously,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
when
justice
frankfurter
in
1952
talked
about
teachers
as
the
high
priests
of
our
democracy,
he
made
an
important
point
in
suggesting
that
one
of
the
most
important
values
that
those
teachers
model
is
the
value
of
open
inquiry,
the
value
of
free
speech
and
an
informed
citizenry.
and
even
the
teacher
who
out
in
society
advocated
some
of
the
really
more
outlandish
positions
that
might
be
attributed
to
people,
not
this
position,
which
is
hardly
outlandish...
29
states
have
adopted
it...
but
even
if
a
teacher
out
in
the
society,
in
the
community,
said,
i
think
that
many
of
the
laws
that
all
you
people
think
that
are
reasonable
are
really
crazy,
it
is
part
if
the
lesson
that
teachers
are
to
impart
in
this
society
that
a
teacher
ought
not
to
be
silenced
and
fired
for
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
which
aspect
of
the
holding?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
lawyers
can't
be
punished
for
criticizing
the
smith
act,
as
you
point
out,
justice
brennan,
then
teachers
can't
be
punished
for
criticizing
the
anti-sodomy
act.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
anti-sodomy
act
and
overthrowing
the
government?
it
seems
to
me
that,
if
anything,
it
is
obviously
more
serious
to
bring
the
government
down
by
force
and
violence
than
to
engage
in
even
the
private
conduct
for
whose
advocacy
a
teacher
could
be
fired.
but
interestingly,
mr.
chief
justice,
judge
barrett,
dissenting
in
the
tenth
circuit,
thought
it
was
the
other
way
around.
that
is,
he
thought
that
even
though
this
form
of
advocacy
or
encouragement
or
promotion
of
criminal
and
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
would
be
protected,
that
there
was
something
so
much
worse
about
homosexuality,
because
it
was,
he
said,
malum
in
se,
that
you
don't
have
to
show
any
real
probability
of
harm.
you
just
fire
someone.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
expresses
an
attitude
of
horror
and
unspeakability
also
suggested
by
the
fact
that
the
crime
isn't
even
named
in
the
oklahoma
statute.
it
is
the
detestable
crime
against
nature.
one
can
either
view
it
as
so
horrible
that
it
can't
even
be
named
or
one
can
view
it
as
activity
that
is
really
nobody
else's
business.
but
however
you
view
it,
isn't
it
the
fundamental
lesson
of
freedom
of
speech
that
those
who
seriously
disagree
with
the
majority's
view
should
not
be
forced
to
hedge
and
trim
every
word,
waiting
to
hear
what
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
on
certification
tells
them
this
vague
and
opaque
and
sweeping
and
broad
law
really
means?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
you
mean
other
speech?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
you
incite
it,
you
would
get
shot,
surely,
and
if
you
incite
homosexual
activity,
then
you
are
committing
a
crime
in
oklahoma,
and
you
go
to
jail,
and
from
jail
you
can't
teach.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
suppose
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
suppose
if
you
go
out
and
begin
committing
homosexual
sodomy,
that
is,
anything
close
to
the
act
itself
is
a
crime
in
oklahoma,
and
if
you
impose
it
or
solicit
it,
that
is,
the
kind
of
activity
that
is
ancillary
to
it,
you
can
be
fired
as
a
teacher.
the
question
in
this
case
isn't
what
happens
if
you
begin
to
commit
it.
the
question
is,
what
happens
if
you
discuss
it
favorably,
express
sympathy
to
it,
express
sympathy
in
any
of
a
number
of
possible
ways?
and
there
is
no
way
to
give
an
answer
to
that
question
by
one
simple
interpretation.
the
only
way
to
give
that
answer
is
to
apply
the
first
amendment
to
it.
and
in
the
name
of
the
first
amendment,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
only
one
correct
outcome
in
this
case.
one
moral
certitude
after
another
has
led
men
to
hound
others
from
their
midst.
their
ideas
seemed
alien.
they
were
too
different.
but
as
justice
brandeis
reminded
us
long
ago,
men
feared
witches
and
burnt
women.
that
is
not
the
proudest
part
of
this
nation's
heritage.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
is
right.
encouraging--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--encouraging
or
promoting.
well,
as
you
said,
justice
white,
in
the
wrightman
case,
remember--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
is
the
one
proposition
to
which
it
may
really
be
relevant.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
three
words
together,
advocating,
encouraging,
or
promoting.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
advocating
that
the
law
be
repealed
might
encourage
or
promote
the
underlying
activity.
the
reason
that
you
advocate
repeal
is
to
liberate
the
activity
from
the
inhibition
of
this
law.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
suppose
the
activity
is
indirectly
encouraged.
but
remember,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it
is
quite
crucial
that
when
that
line
of
argument
was
pursued
in
the
district
court,
that
is,
it
would
be
quite
satisfactory
to
the
gay
task
force
to
have
this
law
effectively
rewritten
by
somebody,
or
a
promise
of
non-enforcement
clearly
and
bindingly
made,
if
you
stop
short
of
deliberately
urging
the
actual
commission
of
the
crime.
people
don't
get
up
on
soapboxes
and
say,
sodomy
now.
that
isn't
the
problem.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
the
state
court
in
a
single
decision
could
construe
it,
that
would
be
fine.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
it
construe
it
to...
if
this
court
were
to
ask
the
state
court,
does
this
law
henceforth
apply
only
to
directly
and
deliberately
urging
the
commission
of
the
specific
crime
with
the
intent
that
the
crime
be
committed,
and
if
their
answer
to
that
question
is,
yes,
we
will
effectively
rewrite
the
law
so
that
it
all
it
covers,
that
would
satisfy
the
purpose.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
would
think
even
without
this
law,
that
teacher
could
probably
have
been
legally
fired,
because...
well,
certainly
under
this
law
that
teacher
could
be
fired.
i
guess
your
question
is,
would
it
be
constitutional
to
apply
the
law
that
way
to
that
teacher.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
under
this
law
i
think
not,
but
in
general
the
answer
is,
i
think
you
could
fire
someone
in
class
for
saying,
i
encourage
you
to
go
out
and
commit
a
crime,
and
it
wouldn't
matter
what
the
crime
was.
but
all
that
tells
us--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
it
has
to
have
that
effect.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
