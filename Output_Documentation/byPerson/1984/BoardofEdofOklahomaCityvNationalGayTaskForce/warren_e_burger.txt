chief
justice

e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
board
of
education
of
oklahoma
city
against
the
national
gay
task
force.
mr.
arrow,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
is
this
a
case
where
we
ought
to
have
the
views
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state?
chief
justice
burger
could
oklahoma
prohibit
a
school
teacher
from
smoking
in
the
classroom?
chief
justice
burger
on
what
grounds?
chief
justice
burger
any
other
ground
besides
health?
chief
justice
burger
how
about
the
role
model
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
suppose
justice
tobriner
would
embrace
in
that
general
statement
the
laws
on
drugs,
murder?
chief
justice
burger
a
right
to
decriminalize
them?
chief
justice
burger
now,
bringing
it
away
from
his
general
statement
down
to
the
framework
of
this
case--
chief
justice
burger
--suppose
the
prohibition
was
against
advocating
drug
use,
private
or
public,
murder.
chief
justice
burger
what
if
the
advocacy
is
of
theft,
rape?
the
same
proposition--
chief
justice
burger
you
are
starting
there
with
a
conclusion
that
this
is
protected
discussion.
isn't
that
what
this
case
is
about,
whether
it
is
protected
discussion?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
a
legislature
is
entitled
to
take
into
account
the
reality,
if
you
concede
that
it
is
a
reality,
that
teachers
in
schools,
particularly
grade
school
and
high
school
level,
are
role
models
for
the
pupils?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
counsel
could
amend
the
statute
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
burger
well,
let's
stay
with
the
amending.
you
are
chastising
him
for
not
amending
the
statute.
until
he
gets
elected
to
the
legislature,
he
has
no
standing
to
do
that.
chief
justice
burger
you
think
those
two
things
are
quite
parallel,
apparently.
chief
justice
burger
what
are
the
immediate
consequences
of
trying
to
overthrow
the
government
by
use
of
actual
force
and
violence?
the
immediate
consequences
are
reciprocity
with
the
same
kind
of
treatment,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
burger
yes,
you
get
shot.
chief
justice
burger
no,
you
are
changing
this
quite
markedly.
i
am
saying
that
if
you
go
out
and
begin
to
overthrow
the
government,
any
government
of
any
country,
the
authorities
will
start
shooting
themselves.
they
don't
engage
in
lawsuits.
they
shoot.
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
