mr.
tribe,
isn't
that
the
reason
you
should
give
the
state
an
opportunity
to
limit
its
own
laws?
justice
marshall
well,
couldn't
you
file
a
lawsuit
against
them
in
the
state
court?
justice
marshall
why?
justice
marshall
why
would
that
be
better?
justice
marshall
do
you
mean
you
filed
this
case
for
the
purpose
of
getting
us
to
send
it
back?
justice
marshall
you
say
now
it
is
all
right
to
send
it
back.
justice
marshall
you
are
asking
a
state
supreme
court
to
interpret
its
own
state
statute.
justice
marshall
that
is
all
you
are
asking.
justice
marshall
that
is
not
in
this
record.
justice
marshall
i
am
talking
about
the
beating
up
business.
justice
marshall
that
is
not
in
this
record.
justice
marshall
let's
stick
to
the
record.
justice
marshall
it
is
necessary
to
stick
to
the
record.
