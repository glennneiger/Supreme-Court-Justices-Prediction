justice
white
well,
have
you
urged
it
before?
justice
white
how
about
abstention?
justice
white
in
either
court
of
law?
justice
white
well,
the
only
issue
here
is
conduct,
isn't
it?
isn't
it
the
conduct
part
of
the
statute?
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
statute
defines
activity
and
conduct
differently.
justice
white
and
what
is
at
issue
here,
activity
or
conduct?
justice
white
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
white
all
right.
we
should
talk
about
that
then.
justice
white
did
you
cite
childers
in
your
brief?
justice
white
that's
what
i
thought.
so
what
is
the
citation?
justice
white
thank
you.
justice
white
well,
in
order
to
violate
this
statute
or
to
be
a
reason
for
his
discharge,
there
has
to
be
a
finding
that
even
though
he...
that
the
conduct,
the
public
homosexual
conduct
that
is
charged
has
rendered
him
unfit.
justice
white
and
does
the
conclusion
that
he
is
unfit
have
to
come
within
one
of
the
reasons
in
that
general
statute
about
fitness?
justice
white
but
after
they
consider
these
four
factors
in
paragraph
c,
they
still
have
to
arrive
at
a
bottom
line
on
fitness.
justice
white
that
has
to
be
one
of
the
reasons
in
that
general
statute?
justice
white
the
defendant
was
the
board,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
and
is
it
true
that
it
has
a
statutory
obligation
to
enforce
it?
justice
white
it
had
no
discretion
but
to
enforce
it?
justice
white
i
suppose...
and
the
complaint
did
allege
that.
justice
white
well,
after
we
hear
your
argument
we
will
know
what
to
ask
them.
justice
white
well,
you
do
challenge,
i
take
it,
a
rule
that
said
that
you
may
not
discuss
homosexuality
in
class?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
so
you
would
say
there
are
some
limits
to
what
you--
justice
white
--i
would
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
teacher
in
the
class
could
not
be
fired
for
in
class
urging
that
the
laws
against
homosexuality
be
repealed.
justice
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
any
time,
any
time.
justice
white
i
know
you
don't
because
you
are
arguing
overbreadth,
that
it
covers
non-classroom
activity.
justice
white
mr.
tribe,
what...
public
homosexual
conduct
is
what
is
involved
here,
but
it
at
least
include
either
advocating,
soliciting,
imposing,
encouraging,
or
promoting.
justice
white
i
take
it...
you
have
said
time
and
time
again
that
if
you
just
got
up
and
urged
that
the
law
be
repealed,
the
law
against
homosexuality
be
repealed,
you
would
be
advocating,
soliciting,
imposing,
encouraging,
or
promoting?
justice
white
well,
as
to
the
wrightman
case,
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
that
case
cited
for
anything.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
white
well,
it
may
not
be.
0
[generallaughter.]
we
will
soon
find
out.
you
say
the
word
is
"advocating"?
is
that
it?
justice
white
advocating
that
the
law
be
repealed
would
be
encouraging?
justice
white
suppose
a
teacher
gets
up
in
a
classroom
and
says,
i
encourage
each
of
you
to
engage
in
homosexual
activity,
and
that
is
all
he
says
or
she
says.
now,
could
that
teacher
be
legally
fired
under
this
act?
justice
white
i
want
to
know
whether
you
would
say
firing
a
person
for
saying
that
would
be
constitutional.
justice
white
whatever
the
teacher
says
inside
the
classroom
or
outside
the
classroom
has
got
to
be
at
least
to
encourage
homosexuality.
justice
white
yes.
