mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
not
only,
quite
evidently,
the
first
amendment
interests
of
public
school
teachers,
but
it
involves
as
well
the
privacy
interests
of
students.
it
involves,
in
addition
to
that,
parental
interests
in
the
rearing
of
their
children.
moreover,
it
involves
state
interests
in
effective
public
education
as
well.
perhaps
no
single
governmental
goal--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
would
observe
that
based
on
third
party
standing
rationales,
that
it
is
certainly
arguable
that
the
gay
task
force
has
standing.
we
would,
however,
further
observe
that
under
the
approach
of
united
public
workers
versus
mitchell,
there
might
in
fact
be
a
problem
with
ripeness.
now,
this,
of
course,
has
not
been
resolved
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
your
honor,
we
feel
that
it
is.
we
feel
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute
such
as
this,
which
has
never
been
construed,
it
has
never
been
applied,
we
certainly
do
know
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
the
enforcement
policies
of
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
and
of
other
boards
of
education
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
have
not
been
overly
exuberant,
as
has
been
asserted
by
the
gay
task
force.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
that...
we
have
inserted
that
in
the
record,
in
our
blue
brief.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
of
the
certification
statute?
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
cited
it
in
part.
i
can
refer
you
to
it.
this
would
be
at
page
16
of
the
blue
brief,
your
honor,
of
the
brief
of
appellant,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
citation
to
that
is
20
oklahoma
statute,
section
1602.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
you
are
welcome.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
we
have
urged
the
lack
of
standing
before.
that
was
decided--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--we
have
not
urged
abstention.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
nevertheless,
we
would
assert
that
at
this
point
this
court
certainly
could
consider
it
sua
sponte.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
would
assert
them
as
alternative
arguments.
we
would
assert
that
abstention
in
the
interest
of
federalism
under
the
pullman
doctrine
would
be
appropriate
here.
we
would
also
alternatively
assert
that
should
the
court
not
be
persuaded
of
the
pullman
argument
in
chief,
that
then
the
certification
statute
might
easily
be
invoked.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
we
have
so
urged
that
in
proposition
1...
i
believe
it
is
1b,
your
honor.
yes.
turning
to
the
merits,
should
the
court
not
be
persuaded
of
the
abstention
argument,
or
of
the
dismissal
argument,
we
would
observe
the
significance
of
the
interests
involved
are
clearly
paramount.
ninety-two
percent
of
all
children
in
the
united
states
of
school
age
attend
public
schools.
we
think
that
this
decision
in
this
case
may
in
fact
be
a
central
precedent-setting
decision
for
purposes
of
what
public
school
teachers
may
and
may
not
advocate.
in
defending
the
constitutionality
of
the
challenged
statute,
the
appellant
board
of
education
will,
as
time
permits,
hopefully
address
five
issues
central--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
homosexual
activity
is,
of
course,
defined
in
very
specific
terms
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
as
the
commission
of
an
act
defined
in
section
886
of
title
21,
which
has
been
defined
as
the
offense
of
criminal
sodomy.
so
the
statute
does...
we
admit
clearly
the
statute
may
be
disingenuously
written.
activity
is
certainly
a
very
broad
term
to
talk
about
public
homosexual
activity,
but
in
section
a1
of
the
statute,
the
statute
goes
on
very
clearly
to
say
what
it
means
by
public
homosexual
activity,
and
that
is
the
crime
of
sodomy
as
defined
in
title
21,
section
866.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
we
certainly
think
that
it
could.
yes.
that
might
be--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--on
the
grounds
that
it
might
impair
student
health,
for
example.
the
medical
evidence
is
unclear
for--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--possibly,
possibly--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--yes.
that
is
certainly
possibly
true.
the
institution
that
i
teach
at
certainly
precludes
me
from
so
doing.
i
think,
given
the
role
model
nature,
i
think
that
might
be
appropriate.
now,
of
course,
this
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
legislature
to
decide
which
exact
types
of
activity
are
worse
than
other
types
of
activity.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
well,
here
we
are
talking
about
advocacy
of
the
specific
crime.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
what
is
at
issue
here
is
public
homosexual
conduct.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
i
plan
on
doing
that.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
it
does.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
for
him
to
advocate
the
commission
of
the
crime
would
be
precluded
by
the
statute.
for
him
to
advocate
the
decriminalization
of
the--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--advocating
the
commission
of
the
crime
is
precluded
by
the...
or
at
least
it
is
regulated,
to
be
quite
specific,
depending
upon
the
nexus.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
it
is
regulated
by
the
statute.
it
might
be
prohibited,
depending--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--on
a
case
by
case
basis,
your
honor,
it
might
be,
depending
upon
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
nexus
factors,
depending
upon
the
nexus
ramifications.
that's
why
the--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--okay.
your
honor,
the
statute
has
some
very
specific
limiting
factors
which
we
would
refer
you
to
in
section
6103.15(c),
which
include,
for
example,
the
likelihood
that
the
activity
or
conduct
may
adversely
affect
students
or
school
employees,
proximity
in
time
or
place,
extenuating
or
aggravating
circumstances,
repeated
or
continuing
nature
of
the
conduct,
whether
or
not
the
conduct
is
likely
to
dispose
school
children
towards
similar
conduct
or
activity.
so,
in
some
cases
that
type
of
advocacy
might
well
be
precluded
by
the
statute,
depending
upon
the
presence
or
absence
in
whatever
measure--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--yes.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
well,
depending
again
upon
the
adverse
effect
upon
students.
that,
i
think,
is
a
factor
which
the
statute
requires
the
hearing
boards
to
consider.
depending
upon
any
other...
i
suppose,
proximity
in
time
or
place.
if
the
speech
was
given
in
new
york
and
the
teacher
was
in
california,
if
it
was
not
likely
to
come
to
the
attention
of
the
students,
if
it
didn't
come
to
the
attention
of
the
students.
depending
upon
what
age
the
students
are.
we
think
that
would
also
be
an
a
aggravating
or
mitigating
circumstance.
clearly
the
nexus
requirements
in
the
statute
are
flexible,
but
they
have
to
be
flexible
given
the
very
broad
interests
of
the
state
in
effective
public
education.
that,
parenthetically,
we
might
add,
is
one
reason
why
particularly
a
facial
challenge
in
this
case
is
inappropriate.
we
believe
that
generally
a
better
approach
is
the
case
by
case
adjudication
method.
the
statute
has
never
been
invoked.
it
has
never
been
applied.
it
is
challenged
facially.
and
yet
it
is
very
difficult
to
analyze
in
a
particular
case
all
the
myriad
imponderables
that
may
potentially
result
from
a
specific
advocacy
of
that
specific
crime.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
we
have
the
childers
case,
which
i
believe
is
cited
in
the
brief.
this
is
645
pacific
2nd
992.
there
is
other
case
law
which
was
referred
to
in
the
district
court
opinion
which
does
require
it.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
was
concluded
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
noted
that
in
his
opinion
below.
turning
to
the
issues,
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
case
is
a
very
multi-faceted
case,
with
numerous
issues,
the
board
would
like
to
at
least
turn
its
attention
briefly
to
several
of
the
issues
that
come
to
mind.
first,
the
board
would
like
to
establish
the
very
multi-faceted
nature
of
the
governmental
interests,
and
not
only
governmental
interests
in
effective
public
education,
but
parental
and
student
interests
as
well.
second,
the
board
will
establish
that
the
balancing
standard
of
review
is
the
appropriate
standard
of
review
in
teacher
speech
cases,
in
recognition
of
the
multifaceted
nature
of
the
interests
in
effective
public
education.
and
pursuant
to
this
analysis
concerning
the
standard
of
review,
the
board
of
education
will
further
establish
that
the
concept
of
viewpoint
neutrality
which
the
gay
task
force
has
attempted
to
enshrine
as
sacrosanct
in
every
conceivable
application,
in
all
possible
hypothetical
instances,
is
simply
overextended
when
the
premise
of
viewpoint
neutrality
is
extended
to
the
advocacy
of
a
crime
involved
in
the
area,
the
sensitive
area
of
public
school
teacher
speech.
third,
the
board
will
then
proceed
to
describe
the
manner
in
which
the
challenged
statute
contributes
to
the
achievement
of
the
governmental,
parental,
and
student
interests
involved.
fourth,
the
board
will
then
proceed
to
maintain
that
teacher
interests
in
advocating
the
specified
crime
of
homosexual
sodomy
may,
and
again
this
is
central
to
the
analysis
this
statute,
may
on
a
case
by
case
basis
he
outweighed
by
the
interests
in
effective
public
education
described
above.
and
finally,
the
board
of
education
will
establish
that
neither
the
current
generic
fitness
statutes
nor
other
so-called
viewpoint
neutral
alternatives
are
available
to
meet
the
sui
generis
threat
presented
by
the
advocacy
of
criminal
homosexual
sodomy
by
public
school
teachers.
turning
first
of
all
to
the
state
interests
involved,
the
interests
of
the
state,
the
board
of
education
would
submit,
in
effective
public
education
are
both
very
compelling
and
very
broad.
i
think
most
obvious
is
the
interest
in
effective
and
undisrupted
academic
education,
and
clearly
the
apposite
pickering
standard
of
review
contemplates
this
in
the
first
three
factors
which
the
pickering
court
articulated.
second,
i
think,
and
no
less
important
is
the
interest
in
developing
students'
attitudes
toward
governmental
activities,
the
political
process,
the
obligations
of
citizenship.
this
court
recently
reaffirmed
in
the
pico
decision
that
the
goal
includes
the
goal
of
promoting
respect
and
authority
for
law,
which
the
board
of
education
would
submit
would
be
undermined
by
teachers
advocating
specified
crimes.
this
goal
in
fact
is
so
important
that
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief,
many
primary
school
teachers
consider
the
obligation
to
abide
by
school
rules,
for
example,
a
more
important
ultimate
lesson
in
the
first
several
grades
of
education
even
than
academic
education
itself.
that,
we
think,
is
a
very
clear
state
interest,
the
promotion
of
the
respect
and
authority
for
law,
government,
the
political
process,
and
the
responsibilities
of
citizenship.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
we
think
that
is
clearly
core
political
speech.
we
have
specific
oklahoma
case
law
on
that
point.
the
case
is
gay
activist
alliance
versus
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
oklahoma,
in
which
the
oklahoma
supreme
court,
following
the
unwavering
lead
of
this
court,
of
course,
recognized
that
in
fact
that
is
clearly
protected
speech.
and
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
that
same
line
of
analysis
would
not
be
applied
in
analyzing
the
challenged
statute
here.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
the
commission
of
the
specified
crime.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
it
would
not
violate
the
statute,
because
to
say,
i
wish
they'd
leave
these
people
alone,
i
suppose,
could
be
assumed
as
a
sub
silentio
suggestion
that
in
fact
the
statute
should
be
repealed.
we
think,
again,
that
that
is
core
political
speech.
that
clearly
falls
far
short
of
advocacy
of
the
specific--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--no,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
so.
we
recognize,
of
course,
that
the
gay
task
force--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--well,
for
example,
there
was
a
tennessee
case
called
jackson
versus...
i
would
submit
the
authority
to
the
court,
your
honor,
but
there
is
a
tennessee
case
in
which
an
advocating--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
certainly
think
that
the
oklahoma
court
might
be
persuaded
by
the
tennessee
court's
reasoning.
we
certainly
think
that
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
would
construe
the
statute
in
a
manner
so
as
to
render
it
certainly
immune
from
facial--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
yes.
but
we
think
that
that
claim--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--yes,
your
honor.
if
that
were
precluded
by
the
statute,
we
think
that
is
core
political
speech.
we
think
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
would
recognize
that
as
well.
other
courts
certainly
have--
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
in
the
gay
activist
alliance
case
recognized
that
that
type
of
speech
is
constitutionally
protected,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
it
would
deviate
from
that
opinion.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
not
in
the
statute.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
it
is
not
defined.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
sir.
i
understand,
your
honor.
but
in
section
a2
of
the
statute,
the
statute
provides
that
homosexual
conduct
means
advocating
and
so
forth
public
or
private
homosexual
activity.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
so
we
would
certainly
concede
that
the
advocacy
of
private
criminal
sodomy
would
also
come
within
the
statutory
sweep.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
in
the
state
of...
criminal
homosexual...
homosexual
sodomy,
public
or
private,
is
illegal
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
okay.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
as
defined
in
this
statute?
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
well--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--oh,
i
see,
your
honor.
okay.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
if
we
take
activity
in
the
sense
of
meaning
what
it
is
in
section
a1,
then
yes--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--well,
if
we
assume
that
the
definition
of
the
activity,
your
honor...
that
is
what
i
am
focusing
on,
is
the
definition
of
activity.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
think
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute
would
mean
that
the
activity
proscribed
was
the
activity
involved
in
section
886
of
title
21,
and
we
think
that
private
could
easily
be
interpreted
as
simply
that
same
activity
defined
in
section
886,
however,
which
was
practiced
in
private.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
which
words
are
we--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
would
be.
yes.
in
order
to
just
briefly
wrap
up
the
point
about
state
interests
involved
here,
the
third
and,
i
think,
one
which
is
crucial
to
the
resolution
of
this
case
also
is
providing
an
appropriate
introduction
to
traditional,
fundamental
cultural
values,
and
we
think
that
is
no
less
of
a
significant
value
of
public
education
than
the
academic
education
side.
the
court
has
recognized,
for
example,
this
court,
in
pico
that
students
must
be
assisted
in
adjusting
normally
to
their
environment.
they
must
have
traditional,
fundamental
cultural
values
promoted,
and
this
court
has
continuously
respected
the
significance
of
that
interest,
and
has
also
recognized
that
the
duty
to
promote
traditional
fundamental
cultural
values
extends
whether
those...
i
am
quoting
from
this
court's
opinion
in
pico...
"be
they
social,
moral,
or
political.
"
we
think
that
is
a
crucial
state
interest
involved.
and
then,
finally,
given
the
fact
that
the
state
is
acting
in
loco
parentis
in
taking
charge
of
students
for
specified
times
in
each
day...
92
percent
of
students
do
so
attend...
we
think
there
is
also
an
additional
duty
there
to
provide
for
the
psychological
as
well
as
the
pyhsical
welfare
of
children
which
are
in
its
custody
pursuant
to
the
in
loco
parentis
doctrine.
we
think
cumulatively
these
interests
are
compelling,
though
they
need
not
be
under
the
pickering
balancing
approach.
with
these
goals
in
mind,
the
court
has,
of
course,
adopted
a
balancing
standard
of
review
ever
since
the
landmark
watershed
opinion
in
pickering
in
1968,
nor,
we
would
submit,
pursuant
to
the
pickering
balancing
approach,
are
state
and
teacher
interests
the
only
interests
to
be
weighed
in
the
balance.
we
would
further
submit
that
student
interests
of
the
sort
recognized
by
this
court
in
ginsberg,
ferber,
and
fcc
versus
pacifica
foundation,
should
be
weighed
in
the
pickering
balance
as
well.
we
would
further
suggest,
and
the
gay
task
force
certainly
has
suggested
a
virtually
limitless
marketplace
of
ideas
approach
to
be
applied
pursuant
to
its
analysis
of
first
amendment
teacher
speech
rights.
however,
the
board
of
education
would
submit
that
teachers
may
have
restrictions
placed
on
their
speech,
as
was
recognized,
not
specifically,
but
analogously
in
other
cases.
the
court,
for
example,
noted
in
ginsberg
that
a
state
may
permissibly
determine
that
at
least
in
some
areas
a
child,
like
someone
in
a
captive
audience,
is
not
possessed
of
that
full
capacity
for
individual
choice
which
is
the
presupposition
of
first
amendment
guarantees.
the
board
of
education
therefore
submits
that
the
pickering
approach
and
not
the
impressionistic
and
incomplete
approach
adopted
by
the
tenth
circuit
majority
below
should
guide
analysis
in
the
instant
case.
the
gay
task
force
has
suggested
an
absolute
principle
of
viewpoint
neutrality
to
be
applied
under
all
circumstances
and
in
all
contexts,
including
teacher
speech.
the
board
of
education
submits
that
this
promise
is
overextended
in
light
of
the
crucial
value
orientation
function
which
public
schools
and
public
school
teachers,
who
obviously
act
as
role
models
to
impressionable
youth,
are
called
upon
to
fulfill.
in
the
educational
context,
we
would
submit,
the
premise
is
overextended,
although
viewpoint
neutrality
as
a
general
premise
is
certainly
legitimate.
we
would
pose
a
couple
of
hypotheticals
at
this
juncture.
for
example,
let's
suppose
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
hypothetically
passed
a
statute
precluding
teachers
from
advocating
the
use
of
heroine,
which
is
also
a
felony
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
as
is
criminal
sodomy.
we
certainly
would
suggest
that
viewpoint
neutrality
would
not
suggest
that
because
viewpoints
antithetical
to
heroine
use
could
be
presented,
that
therefore
viewpoint
neutrality
would
also
mean
that
viewpoints
favorable
to
it
should
be
presented.
this
might
conceivably
be
extended
in
other
circumstances
even
past
criminal
conduct,
but
of
course
the
court
would
not
need
to
go
that
far,
but
for
example
let's
suppose
we
had
another
oklahoma
statute
in
which
the
court,
for
example,
or
in
which
the
legislature
decided
that
teachers
should
not
be
permitted
to
advocate
racial
bigotry
in
public
in
a
way
which
is
likely
to
come
to
the
attention
of
the
students.
clearly
racial
bigotry
is
not
criminal.
this
statute
involves
criminal
activity.
but
we
certainly
think
viewpoint
neutrality
would
not
go
that
far.
consequently,
we
assert
that
that
premise
is
simply
overextended
as
applied
to
teacher
speech
in
public
education,
especially
when
the
nexus
factors
and
the
appropriate
hearings
would
permit
the
determinations
to
be
made
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
pursuant
to
the
applicable
pickering
balancing
standard
of
review,
the
oklahoma
legislature
has
elected
to
regulate
not
a
flat
ban,
as
is
asserted
by
the
gay
task
force,
the
manner
in
which
public
school
teachers
advocate
the
specified
crime
of
homosexual
sodomy.
the
statute,
we
would
submit,
in
terms
of
its
nexus
factors,
is
as
narrowly
drawn
as
can
reasonably
be
expected
without
the
necessity
of
writing
another
napoelonic
code,
given
the
breadth
of
the
interests
in
effective
public
education,
given
the
need
on
a
case
by
case
basis
to
determine
whether
in
a
particular
case
there
has
been
a
material
or
substantial
disruption
in
the
educational
process.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that
is
true
your
honor.
point
well
taken.
perhaps
the
united
states
code
would
be
a
better
example.
in
short,
we
would
submit,
pursuant
to
this
analysis,
that
the
target
clearly...
that
the
statute
does
clearly
target
the
aforementioned
goals
of
producing
effective
public
education,
making
sure
that
student
morality
is
not
corrupted,
ensuring
that
the
students
are
protected
in
their
psychological
as
well
as
physical
well-being
and
that
the
obligations
of
citizenship,
which
include
the
obligation
to
obey
the
law,
and
we
might
again
parenthetically
point
out
here
what
is
essentially
asserted
by
the
gay
task
force
is
that
the
laws
against
criminal
homosexual
sodomy
are
uncommonly
silly
laws,
but
certainly
one
of
the
obligations
of
citizenship
is
to
obey
the
law
whether
the
law
is
uncommonly
silly
or
not,
provided
that
the
right
of
core
political
speech
to
advocate
that
the
law
should
be
changed
is
preserved,
and
we
would
submit
that
that
is
in
fact
preserved
under
the
instant
statute.
we
would
next
assert
that
teacher
interests
may
on
a
case
by
case
basis
be
outweighed
by
interests
of
the
state,
of
parental
rights,
and
of
the
students
themselves
of
the
privacy
nature
that
we
have
just
described,
and
again,
we
would
assert
that
clearly
the
statute
does
not
overbroadly
preclude
teachers
from
advocating
legislative
change.
the
gay
task
force
has
asserted
that
joining
the
national
democratic
party
might
somehow
indirectly
encourage
or
promote
criminal
sodomy
because
the
national
democratic
party
does
have
a
plank
which
does
advocate
the
decriminalization
of
any
forms
of
homosexual
activity.
we
think
that
that
reading
of
the
statute
is
simply
not
a
fair
reading.
we
think
that
that
reading
of
the
statute
attempts
to
insert
the
word
"indirectly"
prior
to
the
words
"indirectly
advocating",
or
"indirectly
promoting",
or
"indirectly
encouraging".
we
don't
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute.
we
don't
think
that
that's
the
reading
that
would
be
given
to
that
statute
should
the
statute
ever
be
invoked
and
should
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
be
called
upon
to
construe
it
in
any
context.
the
last
argument
i'd
like
to
address
is
the
argument
asserted
by
the
gay
task
force
that
other
viewpoint
neutral
alternatives
may
be
available
as
less
restrictive
alternatives
to
the
present
system
of
regulation
of
speech.
and
we
would
attempt
to
first
of
all
put
this
argument
in
context,
of
course.
the
less
restrictive
alternative
as
applied
to
teacher
speech
is
not
an
individually
dispositive
first
amendment
standard
of
review
when
applied
to
teacher
speech.
this
court
made
very
clear
in
the
pickering
decision
that
in
fact
the
balancing
test
was
to
be
applied.
the
court
waxed
eloquent
on
the
dangers
of
mechanistic
jurisprudence.
certainly
heeding
that
caution,
the
board
of
education
would
not
attempt
to
itself
fall
victim
to
mechanistic
jurisprudence
by
asserting
that
the
picketing
factors
are
exclusive.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
board
of
education
would
concede
arguendo
that
the
question
of
the
availability
of
a
less
restrictive
alternative
should
be
considered,
but
only
as
a
factor
in
applying
the
picketing
balancing
approach.
it
should
not
be
held
to
be
an
individually
dispositive
criterion
here.
it
therefore
becomes
appropriate
to
examine
the
other
availabilities,
the
other
statutes,
for
example,
the
generic
oklahoma
teacher
fitness
statute,
in
an
attempt
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
activity
which
can
clearly
constitutionally
be
prescribed
might
also
not
be
prescribed
by
a
viewpoint
neutral
generic
statute
such
as
that
which
is
in
place
currently
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
we
would
refer
the
court
to
title
70,
oklahoma
statute,
5-103,
the
main
generic
teacher
fitness
statute,
which
includes,
for
example,
among
reasons
for
dismissal
of
public
school
teachers,
immorality,
wilfull
neglect
of
duty,
incompetency,
cruelty,
and
moral
turpitude,
as
well
as
the
commission
of
a
felony.
well,
of
course,
beginning
at
the
end,
advocacy
of
criminal
sodomy
is
not
a
felony
in
oklahoma,
so
it
certainly
wouldn't
come
under
the
condition
of
a
felony.
moral
turpitude
case
law
has
been
somewhat
obscure.
in
the
case
of
kelly
versus
city
of
tulsa,
for
example,
the
criteria
were
given
as
involving
an
act,
an
offense,
which
is
actually
a
crime,
committed
with
criminal
intent,
and
in
that
case
the
court
concluded,
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
concluded
that
being
a
public
drunk
was
not
an
act
of
moral
turpitude
since
by
definition
it
was
not
committed
with
criminal
intent.
we
don't
think
moral
turpitude
stretches
to
cover
the
conduct
which
is
precluded
under
the
instant
challenged
statute.
wilfull
neglect
of
duty
has
been
very
narrowly
interpreted.
the
childers
case,
which
i
have
cited
before
to
the
court,
talks
about
knowingly
and
purposefully.
in
any
case,
the
question
of
neglect
of
duty
doesn't
seem
to
be
applicable
to
the
challenged
statute.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
i
believe
we
did.
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.

the
citation
on
this
is

pacific

mr.

w.

mr.

i

is
in
a
footnote
in
the
yellow
brief,
i
believe.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
short,
because
of
the
sui
generis
nature
of
the
threat
to
student
morality,
to
proper
traditional
cultural
values,
the
threat
which
goes
further
and
may
under
certain
circumstances
in
specific
cases
also
affect
the
effectiveness
of
teacher
performance
in
the
classroom,
as
justice
frankfurter
noted
long
ago,
the
law
of
imitation
operates,
and
non-conformity
is
not
an
outstanding
of
young
children,
we
think
therefore
that
all
of
the
goals
of
public
education
may
be
threatened
by
teacher
advocacy
of
this
specific
crime.
we
think,
given
the
breadth
of
the
interests
of
the
state,
of
the
family,
and
of
the
child
himself,
in
effective
public
education
and
the
preservation
of
student
morality,
we
therefore
think
that
these
interests
simply
outbalance
any
teacher
interest
in
advocacy
of
this
specific
crime.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
those
are
the
nexus
factors,
the
determination
of
unfitness.
the
advocacy
is
the
only
condition
present.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor,
we
think
it
does.
the
statute
does
say...
the
factors,
of
course,
of
mitigating
circumstances
and
occupational
performance
are
very
broad,
and
would
require
and
would
necessitate
that
the
hearing
officers
consider
a
multiplicity
of--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you.
