justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
justice
stevens
you
say
the
case
will
present
a
test
as
to
what
public
school
teachers
may
or
may
not
advocate.
justice
stevens
as
you
read
the
statute,
does
it
prohibit
activity
by
a
teacher
which
is
advocacy
of,
just
to
use
the
language
of
the
statute,
advocacy
of
homosexual
activity?
justice
stevens
i
am
still
a
little
puzzled,
because
the
term
"conduct"
as
used
in
the
statute
includes
advocacy,
does
it
not?
justice
stevens
yes.
so
necessarily
we
have
to
talk
about
advocacy.
justice
stevens
and
does
this
statute...
would
this
statute
make
it
dischargeable
conduct
for
a
public
school
teacher
to
make
a
speech
in
which
he
advocated
as
a
general
proposition
that
private
homosexual
activity
which
is
prohibited
by
law--
justice
stevens
--is
nevertheless
a
good
idea?
would
it
be
a
crime
for
him
to
give
such
a
speech?
justice
stevens
no,
to
advocate
the
commission
of
the
crime.
justice
stevens
in
your
view
of
the
statute,
is
such
a
speech
prohibited
by
the
statute?
justice
stevens
is
it
a
cause
for
discharge
if
a
person
gives
such
a
statement?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
stevens
he
gave
the
speech...
he
said,
i
intend
to
give
this
speech
over
and
over
again.
justice
stevens
then
i
suppose
it
would
be
prohibited?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
stevens
the
term
"public
homosexual
activity"
is
defined
as
the
crime.
justice
stevens
is
the
term
"private
homosexual
activity"
defined?
because
you
can't
advocate
that,
either,
as
i
read
the
statute.
justice
stevens
it
is
not
defined?
justice
stevens
well,
what
about
a
speech
then
advocating
private
homosexual
activity
and
said,
but
be
careful
not
to
violate
the
prohibition
against
public
homosexual
activity?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well,
is
all
private
homosexual
activity
a
crime?
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
answered
my
question.
justice
stevens
is
all
private
homosexual
activity--
justice
stevens
--well,
the
term
isn't
defined
in
this
statute.
justice
stevens
private
homosexual
activity.
justice
stevens
is
all
private
homosexual
activity
forbidden
by
law
in
oklahoma?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
because
that
refers
to
public.
i
am
asking
about
private.
justice
stevens
there
is
no
definition
of
activity.
there
is
a
definition
of
public
homosexual
activity
in
one.
justice
stevens
then
the
word
"private"
is
really
redundant
in
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
your
suggest
that
they
could
just
read
those
words
out
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
and
that
the
statute
does
not
in
fact
prohibit...
the
words
a2.
as
i
understand
your
reading,
they
are
totally
redundant.
