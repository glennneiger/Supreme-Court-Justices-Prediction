mr.
arrow--
justice
rehnquist
--i
wonder
if
it
doesn't
involve
some
judicial
interest
in
seeing
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy.
as
i
read
the
record
here,
or
there
is
no
indication
that
the
school
board
ever
applied
this
particular
provision
to
anyone.
justice
rehnquist
and
is
i
read
it
there
was
no
threat
that
it
was
going
to
apply
it
to
anyone.
justice
rehnquist
and
the
only
party
plaintiff
was
a
national
organization.
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
if
there
is
no
real
case
or
controversy,
if
this
is
just
an
abstraction,
and
there
is
no
real
threat
to
the
third
party
people,
the
plaintiff,
it
is
not
a
question
for
abstention,
it
is
not
a
question
for
certification,
it
is
a
question
for
dismissal
by
the
district
court
on
jurisdictional
basis.
justice
rehnquist
was
your
answer
to
the
earlier
question
about
whether
the
statute
would
be
invoked
if
a
teacher
simply
advocated
the
repeal
of
the
consensual
sodomy
statute,
would
it
be
invoked
then?
justice
rehnquist
so
the
only
kind
of
speech
implicated
is
where
a
teacher
were
to
advocate
the
commission
of
a
crime?
justice
rehnquist
the
napoleonic
code
is
actually
very
short.
justice
rehnquist
i
say,
the
napoleonic
code
is
actually
very
short.
it
just
treats
tort
law
in
one
sentence.
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
tribe,
i
think
the
abstraction
in
this
case
is
that,
if
you
agree,
the
statute
has
never
been
applied
to
anyone,
no
one
is
being
threatened
with
its
application,
it
has
never
been
construed
by
the
state
courts.
are
all
three
of
those
points
true?
justice
rehnquist
has
the
oklahoma
city
school
board
in
this
record
threatened
to
apply
the
statute
to
any
particular
individual?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
there
is
no
allegation
as
i
read
it
that
this
particular
regulation
of
the
oklahoma
city
school
board
has
ever
been
applied
to
a
single
living
soul.
justice
rehnquist
i
am
not
interested
in
why.
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
is
also
on
all
fours
with
poe
against
ullman,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
this
statute
was
ever...
had
ever
been
applied.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
how
far
can
you
back
up
from
a
statute
and
still
challenge
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
baggett
against
bullitt,
the
principal
had
circulated
a
memorandum
saying
that
those
teachers
were
going
to
have
to
take
the
oath.
there
was
not
the
total
absence
of
enforcement
there
that
there
is
here.
justice
rehnquist
abood
wasn't
a
classroom
teaching
case.
that
was
a
case
where
the
teachers
were
presenting
a
point
of
view
to
the
school
board.
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
ganging
up,
i
take
it
you
mean
chiding.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
activity
wouldn't
be
encouraged
until
repeal
actually
took
place,
would
it?
justice
rehnquist
if
the
task
force
offered
to
stipulate
to
a
construction
in
the
district
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
all
the
more
reason
why
the
state
court
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
construe
it.
justice
rehnquist
couldn't
they
construe
it
according
to
the
stipulation
that
your
client
offered
to
enter
into?
