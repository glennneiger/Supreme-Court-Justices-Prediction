mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
an
important
issue
of
administrative
law
that
we
had
thought
was
well
settled
prior
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
that
issue
is
whether
the
courts
have
authority
to
review
and
set
aside
an
administrative
agency's
discretionary
determination
not
to
bring
law
enforcement
proceedings
against
someone
who
is
alleged
to
have
violated
a
provision
of
the
agency's
statute.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
justice
o'connor,
that
was
one
of
many
reasons
that
the
fda
gave
for
not
bringing
an
enforcement
action
in
this
case.
it
also--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
before
the
court
could
reach
the
question
of
whether
that
was
right
or
not,
it
would
seem
that
the
court
would
first
have
to
answer
the
question
whether
this
decision
of
the
fda
is
reviewable.
if
it's
reviewable,
then
the
court
can
decide
whether
the
fda
made
an
error.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
when
the
question
arises
in
the
context
of
a
challenge
to
the
failure
or
the
refusal
to
bring
enforcement
proceedings.
but
here
the
fda
didn't
just
say
that
it
didn't
have
statutory
authority.
the
letter,
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
beginning
on
page
81a,
went
on
to
say
as
a
second
and
separate
basis
of
denial,
it
gave
a
number
of
reasons
why
it
would
not
bring
this
proceeding
even
if
in
fact
the
language
of
its
statute
could
be
stretched
to
cover
this
situation.
now,
in
the
last
several
years
a
number
of
states
have
passed
statutes
prescribing
lethal
injection
with
drugs
as
the
method
of
carrying
out
the
death
penalty.
respondents
are
a
group
of
prison
inmates
who
have
been
sentenced
to
capital
punishment
in
two
of
these
states,
texas
and
oklahoma.
in
1980
they
filed
a
citizen
petition
with
the
fda
contending
that
the
states
of
texas
and
oklahoma
were
intending
to
violate
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
apparently
because
the
fda
had
never
approved
the
drugs
in
question
as
safe
and
effective
for
the
purposes
of
human
execution.
the
respondents
asked
the
fda
to
require
warning
labels
on
these
drugs
stating
that
they
couldn't
be
used
as
a
means
of
execution,
and
also
asked
that
the
fda
adopt
a
policy
of
seizing
the
drugs,
bringing
injunctive
proceedings,
and
even
criminal
prosecutions
of
the
responsible
state
prison
officials.
the
fda
declined
to
take
any
of
these
enforcement
measures.
as
i
just
mentioned
in
my
colloquy
with
justice
o'connor,
the
fda
first
concluded
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
intervene
in
the
states'
practice
of
administering
capital
punishment,
but
went
on
to
say
that,
even
if
it
had
jurisdiction,
it
would
decline
to
exercise
it
under
its
inherent
discretion
not
to
pursue
certain
enforcement
matters.
respondents
then
brought
suit
to
challenge
the
fda's
decision.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
grounds
that
the
enforcement
decisions
of
an
executive
agency
are
simply
not
amenable
to
judicial
review.
but
a
divided
panel
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed.
the
d.c.
circuit
held
that
the
fda
in
fact
did
have
jurisdiction
to
intervene
in
this
area
under
the
misbranding
provisions
of
the
food
and
drug
laws.
these
provisions
prohibit
the
misbranding
of
drugs
while
they
are
"held
for
sale",
and
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
seems
to
have
been
that
these
drugs
are
misbranded
because
they're
warning
labels
don't
state
that
they
can
be
used
for
purposes
of
capital
punishment
and
that
they
are
held
for
sale
when
they
are
forceably
administered
to
these
prisoners
pursuant
to
a
court
order.
the
court
then
went
on
to
hold
that
the
fda's
decision
not
to
exercise
its
enforcement
discretion
is
subject
to
judicial
review
and
that
the
fda
had
acted
arbitrarily,
capriciously,
and
without
legal
authority
here.
now,
what
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
ruling
amounts
to
is
this.
first,
the
court
devised
a
highly
imaginative
and
we
think
quite
dubious
construction
of
the
food
and
drug
laws,
in
an
effort
to
conclude
that
the
states'
lethal
injection
procedures
violated
the
misbranding
provisions
of
the
act.
then
the
court
compounded
the
problem
by
holding
that
the
fda
has
a
mandatory
duty,
a
mandatory
duty
to
initiate
investigative
and
enforcement
proceedings,
based
on
this
quite
dubious
legal
theory
and
against
the
agency's
better
judgment,
simply
because
a
citizen
petition
had
been
filed
alleging
a
statutory
violation.
we
think
this
court
should
reject
this
remarkable
restructuring
of
the
proper
role
of
an
agency.
now,
this
case,
to
be
sure,
arises
in
a
somewhat
unusual
factual
context,
but
that
factual
context
should
not
be
allowed
to
obscure
the
important
administrative
law
issues
of
general
applicability
that
were
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
this
case
only
fortuitously
involves
capital
punishment.
if
respondents
prevail
here,
then
it's
reasonable
to
assume
anyone
whose
citizen
petition
is
denied
by
the
fda
can
sue
and
seek
review
of
whether
the
fda
should
have
brought
enforcement
proceedings.
i'm
informed,
by
the
way,
by
the
fda
that
they
are
besieged
by
complaints
filed
by
trade
and
industry
representatives
claiming
that
some
competitor
is
engaging
in
a
misbranding
violation.
in
fact,
there
was
a
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
just
last
year
in
which
some
dairy
producers
sought
review
of
the
fda's
refusal
to
bring
enforcement
proceedings
against
people
who
were
selling
allegedly
misbranded
cheese.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
another
problem,
justice
rehnquist.
of
course
it's
not
limited
just
to
the
fda.
the
ftc,
the
nlrb,
and
the
sec,
for
example,
regularly
declined
to
pursue
investigative
or
enforcement
activity
based
on
the
complaint
of
someone
who
claims
to
have
been
injured
as
a
result
of
that
activity.
and
these
decisions
too
would
presumably
be
subject
to
judicial
scrutiny
under
the
court
of
appeals'
approach.
this
system
of
judicial
oversight
of
the
manner
in
which
executive
agencies
choose
to
deploy
their
enforcement
resources
would
represent
a
sharp
break
from
the
current
state
of
the
law.
this
is
a
suit
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
administrative
procedure
act
generally
makes
all
final
agency
action
subject
to
judicial
review.
but
it
has
two
very
important
exceptions
to
that
general
principle.
one
exception
provides
that
agency
action
is
not
reviewable
if
the
matter
is
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law.
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
got
off
on
entirely
the
wrong
foot
in
this
case
when
it
held
that
this
exception
had
to
be
construed
very
narrowly
because
all
agency
action
is
presumptively
reviewable,
because
any
presumption
that
operates
in
this
area,
it's
that
congress
would
never
have
intended
to
subject
to
judicial
review
the
enforcement
decisions
of
an
administrative
agency
without
a
clear
statement
to
that
effect.
and
that's
because
this
court
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
decisions
of
a
law
enforcement
agency
whether
or
not
to
instigate,
institute
an
investigation
or
an
enforcement
proceeding,
is
committed
to
the
sole
discretion
of
the
administrative
agency.
and
the
court
reaffirmed
this
settled
principle
only
a
few
years
ago
in
the
southern
railway
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
clearly,
many
agency
actions
are
reviewable.
refusal
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
question
is
what
congress
has
provided.
if
congress
has
provided
a
mandatory
duty
to
do
something,
as
it
has
in
many
instances--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there's
a
mandatory
duty
to
initiate
rulemaking,
for
example,
under
many
statutes:
the
osha
statute,
the
epa
statute.
if
someone
claims
that
that
was
violated,
then
the
question
is
obviously
reviewable.
but
there
has
to
be
some
law
to
apply,
which
is
what,
of
course,
the
court
said
in
the
southern
railway
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
wright,
dismissed
this
hundred
year
old
line
of
supreme
court
cases
as
having
a
so-called
anachronistic
ring
to
it.
but
we
don't
think
that
these
decisions
are
anachronistic
at
all.
the
reasons
for
the
settled
rule
against
judicial
review
of
agency
enforcement
decisions
are
not
very
difficult
to
appreciate.
the
decision
of
whether
to
bring
an
enforcement
proceeding
is
not
simply
a
mechanical
task
whereby
the
agency
decides
whether
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
act
has
been
violated.
the
agency
also
has
to
make
a
number
of
policy,
judgment
calls.
it
could
decide,
for
example,
to
bring
a
great
number
of
small
proceedings
because
of
the
in
terrorem
effect
of
doing
so.
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
be
equally
reasonable
to
eschew
bringing
small
proceedings,
but
to
bring
a
number
of
large
enforcement
proceedings.
or
it
could
decide
to
go
against
violators
of
one
provision
of
its
statute
rather
than
another,
in
the
view
that
one
portion
of
the
statute
is
more
important.
it
could
also
decide
only
to
proceed
with
enforcement
when
the
law
is
clear
and
the
agency
is
likely
to
win.
but
it
would
be
equally
reasonable
for
an
agency
to
decide
to
bring
a
number
of
test
cases
and
see
if
it
could
expand
the
outer
perimeter
of
its
authority.
all
of
these
are
policy
and
judgment
calls.
they're
not
legal
decisions.
they're
not
amenable
to
judicial
review.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
our
first...
as
i
thought
i
said
in
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
threshold
question
is
whether
the
agency's
decision
not
to
institute
enforcement
proceedings
is
reviewable
in
court.
you
would
only
reach
the
question--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
question
would
still
be,
has
congress
circumscribed
in
any
way
the
discretion
of
the
agency
to
bring
enforcement
proceedings,
and
there
would
have
to
be
some
law
to
apply.
and
we
would
think
that
even
in
that
instance,
which
i
should
add
is
not
very
likely
to
occur,
because
if
an
agency...
if
the
only
impediment
to
bringing
an
enforcement
proceeding
in
the
agency's
mind
is
whether
they
have
statutory
authority
to
do
it--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
contend
here
that
the
fda
in
fact
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
proceed.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
fda
has
taken
the
position,
and
we
think
that
there
is
certainly
textual
support
for
it,
that
congress
never
intended
intended
the
food
and
drug
laws
to
cover
this
situation,
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
answer--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
as
an
advocate
obviously
we
would
think
some
argument
could
be
made
in
support
of
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction.
the
question
here
is
that
congress
quite
clearly--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
agree
with
that,
we
agree.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
agree
that
the
fda
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
regulate
the
method
of
carrying
out
capital
punishment
by
the
states.
we
don't
think
that
was
within
the
intendment
of
this
consumer
protection
statute.
there's
certainly
not
a
word
in
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
or
anywhere
else
that
congress
ever
thought
that
the
fda
would
be
getting
into
this.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
issue
of
whether
the
fda
has
jurisdiction?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
the
fda
brought
an
enforcement
proceeding
and
the
states
sought
to
have
it
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
this
would
not
be
within
the
fda's
jurisdiction,
then
of
course
the
courts
would
have
something
to
review.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
there
is
a
threshold
issue
before
the
court
of
whether
or
not
the
agency's
decision
not
to
institute
enforcement
proceedings
is
a
decision
that
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
threshold
submission,
that
it
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
then
the
question
arises,
has
the
agency
abused
its
discretion
in
not
bringing
a
proceeding?
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
agency
gave
for
not
bringing
the
proceeding
is
that
it
concluded
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
in
that
context,
the
court
would
then
have
to
decide
that
question,
because
of
course
if
the
agency
did
not
have
jurisdiction
it
couldn't
abuse
its
discretion
by
not
bringing
the
proceeding.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
precisely
correct.
it's
no
different
than
if
a
prosecutor
had
decided,
i'm
not
going
to
bring
a
prosecution
because
i
don't
think
that
state
of
facts
satisfies
the
bank
robbery
statute.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
position
that
we
took
in
that
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
it
is
not...
justice
stevens,
it
is
not
simply
agency
inaction.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
congress
has
required
the
agency
to
act.
if
congress
has
required
the
agency
to
act
in
a
particular
area,
then
agency
inaction
is
subject
to
judicial
review
because
there
is
law
to
apply.
when
congress
has
not
in
any
way
circumscribed
the
agency's
discretion,
when
there
is
no
law
to
apply
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
agency
has
to
act,
then
an
agency's
decision
not
to
act
is
in
fact
not
judicially
reviewable.
and
that's
what
the
court
said
in
the
southern
railway
case.
that
was
a
case
in
which
shippers
challenged
the
icc's
refusal
to
investigate
whether
or
not
certain
railroad
tariffs
were
lawful.
the
commission
refused
to
bring
enforcement
proceedings,
and
the
shippers
sought
judicial
review.
and
this
court
in
a
unanimous
decision
held
that
the
decision
of
the
icc
not
to
bring
enforcement
proceedings
is
not
judicially
reviewable.
and
what
the
court
said
there
is
equally
applicable
here.
let
me
just
read
two
sentences.
this
is
at
442
u.s.
at
page
455.
the
court
said:
"with
respect
to
the
commission's
enforcement
power,
the
statute
is
written
in
the
language
of
permission
and
discretion.
"
"the
statute
is
silent
on
what
factors
should
guide
the
commission's
decision.
"
"there
is
simply
"no
law
to
apply"
in
determining
if
the
decision
is
correct.
"
well,
we
contend
that
the
same
situation
is
fully
applicable
here.
there
is
nothing
in
the
food
and
drug
laws
that
in
any
way
circumscribes
the
food
and
drug
administration's
inherent
discretion
whether
or
not
to
bring
an
enforcement
proceeding.
no
provision
of
the
food
and
drug
law
says
that
the
agency
has
to
prosecute
if
a
violation
of
the
law
is
found.
no
provision
of
the
food
and
drug
law
even
sets
out
criteria
that
the
agency
has
to
follow
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
bringing
an
enforcement
proceeding.
there
is
simply
no
law
to
apply,
and
it's
not
clear
how
a
court
would
ever
go
about
deciding
whether
an
agency
properly
decided
to
bring
enforcement
proceeding
a
rather
than
enforcement
proceeding
p.
it's
worth
pointing
out
and
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
the
massive
responsibilities
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
it
is
essentially
responsible
for
the
safety
of
virtually
all
the
food
and
drugs
distributed
in
interstate
commerce
in
this
country.
now,
obviously
the
resources
of
the
fda
are
finite
and
not
every
violation
can
be
investigated.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
precisely.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
precisely,
it's
the
latter,
and
that
is
the
area
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
exactly
our
position.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
i'm
afraid
what
the
respondents
have
done
is
to
confuse
the
two
situations:
one
where
the
statute
provides
circumstances
in
which
a
violation
of
the
law
occurs,
where
first
there's
law
to
apply
and
if
the
government
brings
a
prosecution
or
an
enforcement
proceeding
the
court
can
decide
whether
or
not
the
statute
has
been
violated...
that
is,
the
run
of
the
mill
enforcement
proceeding...
and
this
situation,
where
the
statute
provides...
congress
has
not
provided
any
standards
by
which
to
decide
whether
the
fda
should
or
shouldn't
bring
any
particular
enforcement
proceeding.
so
it's
not
clear
how
a
court
could
even
go
about
deciding.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
only
statute
that
i
am
aware
of
is
title
iv
of
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act,
which
is
of
course
what
was
involved
in
dunlop
versus
bachowski.
what
makes
bachowski
so
distinguishable
is
that
in
that
case
congress
had
provided...
and
it
was
quite
unusual,
but
i
think
understandable
in
that
context...
that
if
the
secretary
of
labor
had
probable
cause
to
believe
a
violation
of
the
law
had
occurred,
the
secretary
had
to
bring
an
enforcement
proceeding.
the
statute
was
written
in
that
peculiar
way,
i
think
in
part
because
it
wasn't
a
true
exercise
in
prosecutorial
discretion.
the
secretary,
as
this
court
said
in
bachowski,
was
really
acting
as
the
union
members'
lawyer.
and
in
that
situation,
in
that
narrow
situation,
the
court
said
that
there
is
at
least
judicial
review
to
require
the
secretary
to
provide
a
statement
of
reasons
why
he
hasn't
brought
an
enforcement
proceeding.
but
here
there
is
nothing
comparable
in
the
fda
statute,
title
iv,
and
there
is
nothing
that
requires
the
fda
to
bring
any
particular
enforcement
proceeding.
so
as
i
was
saying
a
moment
ago,
not
every
violation
can
be
investigated
or
enforced.
the
resources
of
the
agency
are
finite.
if
it
has
to
bring,
pursuant
to
the
d.c.
circuit's
order,
if
it
has
to
bring
15
enforcement
proceedings
around
the
country
against
states
that
use
drugs
for
capital
punishment
on
the
grounds
that
it's
a
misbranding
violation,
those
resources
are
going
to
be
taken
away
from
some
other
enforcement
activity
that
the
agency
wants
to
pursue.
so
the
question
in
this
case
really
boils
down
to
who
is
to
decide
how
the
agency's
enforcement
resources
are
going
to
be
allocated?
is
it
going
to
be
the
d.c.
circuit
or
is
it
going
to
be
the
commissioner
of
food
and
drugs?
now,
for
all
these
reasons
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
the
fda's
decision
not
to
undertake
enforcement
activity
was
not
subject
to
judicial
review,
simply
because
there's
no
judicially
manageable
standards
to
decide
whether
a
particular
enforcement
proceeding
should
have
been
brought.
but
if
we're
wrong
about
that
and
if
the
fda's
decision
was
in
fact
judicially
reviewable,
then,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
the
question
remains
whether
the
fda
abused
its
discretion
in
not
bringing
the
particular
enforcement
proceeding.
i
want
to
spend
just
a
few
moments
of
my
remaining
time
on
this
secondary
aspect
of
the
case
which,
i
repeat,
the
court
need
not
reach
if
it
agrees
with
us
that
the
decision
itself
is
not
judicially
reviewable.
it
is
truly
hard
to
fathom
how
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
concluded
that
the
agency
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
in
refusal
to
involve
itself
in
an
area
as
far
removed
from
its
statutory
mandate
as
the
investigation
of
state
capital
punishment
procedures.
needless
to
say,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
anywhere
in
the
language
or
legislative
history
of
the
food
and
drug
laws
that
congress
intended
the
fda
statute
to
reach
this
sort
of
activity.
now,
the
respondents'
brief
contains
repeated
references
to
what
they
say
is
the
"thwarting
of
congressional
intent"
here.
that's
the
phrase
they
repeatedly
use,
the
fda
is
thwarting
congressional
intent.
we
challenge
respondents
to
cite
one
provision
in
the
food
and
drug
laws
that
suggests
congress
intended
to
cover
state
capital
punishment
procedures.
we
challenge
them
to
list
one
statement
in
the
legislative
history
in
which
anyone
thought
that
the
statute
would
cover
this
unique
situation,
or
one
statute
in
any
of
the
agency's
regulations,
or
even
one
sentence
in
any
court
decision
construing
the
food
and
drug
laws,
suggesting
that
anyone
until
this
lawsuit
ever
thought
that
the
food
and
drug
laws
were
intended
to
cover
the
court-ordered
imposition
of
capital
punishment.
and
i
think
it
takes
a
fair
amount
of
violence
with
the
statutory
language
to
even
fit
the
states'
activity
within
the
statutory
terms.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
think
that
texas
and
oklahoma
were
engaging
in
a
misbranding
violation,
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
that
conclusion
is
not
intuitively
obvious.
but
even
if
a
colorable
argument
could
be
made
that
the
drugs
used
for
lethal
injections
are
misbranded
because
their
labels
don't
list
capital
punishment
as
an
approved
use,
and
even
if
we
were
to
somehow
conclude
that
the
drugs
were
held
for
sale
when
they
were
coercively
administered
to
a
prisoner,
even
if
we
indulge
in
those
two
assumptions,
then
at
the
very
least
we
think
judge
scalia's
dissent
shows
that
a
very
powerful
and
respectable
argument
could
be
made
against
that.
it's
hard
to
see
how
an
agency
could
possibly
be
said
to
have
abused
its
discretion
in
not
bringing
enforcement
proceedings
that
are
sure
to
be
contested
and
sure
to
lead
to
protracted
and
quite
likely
unsuccessful
litigation.
in
fact,
it's
not
even
clear
how
the
d.c.
circuit
imagined
the
whole
system
would
work,
because
what
the
d.c.
circuit
did
is
devise,
we
think,
a
somewhat
strained
construction
of
the
food
and
drug
laws
that
the
fda
itself
doesn't
agree
with,
and
ordered
the
fda
to
bring
enforcement
proceedings
which
would
surely
be
contested
and
lead
to
litigation.
and
i
assume
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
envisioned
that
the
fda
would
be
presenting
in
litigation
a
construction
of
its
statute
that
it
doesn't
agree
with
at
all.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
think
that
the
d.c.
circuit's
construction
of
the
misbranding
provisions
would
extend
that
far,
or
the
use
of
chloroform
by
a
mugger.
i
should
add
that
the
agency's
fears
of
disruptive
and
ultimately
futile
litigation
against
the
states
here
are
not
far-fetched.
in
fact,
in
recent
weeks
or
recent
months
they
have
been
proven
quite
well
founded.
the
court
will
recall
a
couple
of
months
ago
the
case
of
mr.
o'brien,
who
had
been
sentenced
to
death
by
lethal
injection
in
texas.
he
brought
a
suit
here
last
march
in
the
district
of
columbia
based
on
the
chaney
decision,
seeking
to
have
the
fda
enjoined
to
seize
the
drugs
that
the
state
of
texas
was
planning
to
use
for
his
execution.
and
the
district
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
based
on
the
decision
below,
granted
a
preliminary
injunction
requiring
the
fda
to
seize
these
drugs.
within
hours,
within
hours
of
the
grant
of
that
preliminary
injunction,
the
state
of
texas
had
sued
the
fda
down
in
houston,
claiming
that
this
was
not
within
the
fda's
statutory
mandate,
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
fact
held
that
the
fda
was
not
acting
within
its
powers
in
seizing
these
drugs.
surely
the
fda
acted
responsibly
and
reasonably
in
conserving
its
limited
enforcement
resources
for
matters
much
more
closely
related
to
its
principal
mission
of
protecting
consumers
in
the
marketplace
from
unsafe
and
ineffective
drugs.
if
the
court
has
no
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
a
few
short
matters,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
on
this
business
about
clinical
investigations
and
dogs
which
mr.
kristovich
managed
to
mention
three
times
in
25
minutes.
the
distinction
which
the
fda
has
consistently
made,
but
which
respondents
don't
accept,
is
that
those
cases,
the
cases
they
rely
on
involving
fda
regulation
of
drugs
used
for
clinical
investigations
and
for
euthanasia
for
dogs,
involve
the
marketing,
the
marketing
of
those
drugs
for
those
particular
purposes,
even
though
a
new
drug
application
had
not
been
approved.
that
is
precisely
what
the
agency
views
as
its
central
purpose.
this
case,
on
the
other
hand,
does
not
involve
the
marketing
of
any
drug
for
an
improper
purpose.
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
manufacturer
of
these
drugs
does
not
have
a
proper
new
drug
application
on
file.
this
is
a
misbranding
case.
at
the
end
of
the
road,
someone
has
taken
an
approved
drug
and
allegedly
used
it
for
an
unapproved
purpose.
that
is
a
different
section
of
the
fda's
responsibilities,
and
its
authority
to
act
is
much
more
uncertain.
the
everest
case,
for
example,
which
was
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
same
circuit
that
would
hear
any
case
involving
the
state
of
texas,
had
given
a
fairly
narrow
construction
to
that
provision
of
the
act.
so
those
cases
are
not
in
point
involving
the
dogs
and
the
clinical
investigations.
and
second
and
finally,
i
just
want
to
mention
the
preamble
that
justice
brennan
alluded
to
and
which
is
quoted
at
pages
24a
and
25a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
the
preamble,
as
justice
brennan
noted,
was
the
preamble
to
an
unadopted
regulation.
it
has
no...
the
only
force
it
has
under
the
fda's
regulations
is
as
an
advisory
opinion,
and
all
that
means
under
the
fda's
regulations
is
that
the
fda
has
committed
itself
not
to
take
action
against
someone
who
may
have
relied
on
the
preamble.
the
regulations
make
quite
clear
that
the
preamble
was
not
committing
the
agency
to
bring
an
enforcement
proceeding
against
somebody
else,
and
that's
made
quite
clear
by
the
fda's
regulations,
which
we
quote
at
page
25
of
our
brief,
which
retains
the
agency's
inherent
authority
to
decide
completely
and
for
itself
which
enforcement
proceedings
it
would
bring.
thank
you.
