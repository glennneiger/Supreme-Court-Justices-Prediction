justice
o'connor
mr.
geller,
let
me
stop
you
right
off
the
bat,
if
you
don't
mind,
to
just
see
whether
that's
the
question
we
would
necessarily
have
to
answer.
the
fda
apparently
believed
that
its
statutory
mandate
just
didn't
reach
the
question
of
state-sanctioned
use
of
lethal
injections
for
executions,
and
if
that
is
correct
would
our
inquiry
just
end
there?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
we
thought
that
was
right?
justice
o'connor
yes.
well,
do
you
think
that
the
question
of
whether
something
is
within
the
statutory
jurisdiction
of
fda
at
all
is
something
that
is
reviewable?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
review
that
issue
and
decide
it?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
the
issue
is
before
us
and
we
could
decide
that
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
mr.
geller,
would
the
use
by
law
enforcement
officers
of
mace
in
control
of
riots
or
in
their
police
work
be
something
that's
subject
to
fda
regulation?
justice
o'connor
well,
under
your
view
i
suppose
the
use
of
an
electric
chair
as
well
would
be
a
device
subject
to
fda
regulation?
justice
o'connor
but
it
would
affect
the
structure
or
function
of
the
body.
justice
o'connor
and
i
assumed
you
were
relying
on
that.
