justice
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
isn't
limited
to
the
fda.
justice
rehnquist
but
your
answer
to
the
combined
import
of
justice
o'connor's
and
justice
stevens'
questions,
as
i
understand
those
questions,
is
that
if
the
fda
had
said
only
in
this
case,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
institute
a
prosecution
or
to
institute
an
action,
this
court
should
decide,
because
that
type
of
decision,
whether
or
not
to
institute
an
action,
is
not
reviewable
by
the
courts,
that
we
don't
reach
the
question
of
fda
jurisdiction
because
we
don't
review
that
kind
of
decision?

does

justice
rehnquist
mr.
kristovich,
there
was
an
argument
made
in
some
texas
appellate
case,
wasn't
there,
that
death
by
lethal
injection
amounted
to
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
the
criminal
case
itself?
