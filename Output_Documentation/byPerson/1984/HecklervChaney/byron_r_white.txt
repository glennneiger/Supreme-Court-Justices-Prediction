justice
white
do
you
think
an
ordinary...
am
i
taking
your
time?
justice
white
is
it
part
of
your
position
that
an
ordinary
prosecutorial
decision
to
bring
a
criminal
case
is
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
white
well,
what's
the
difference
between
that
kind
of
a
case
and
this
one?
justice
white
well,
any
member...
let's
suppose
that
there
is
a
complaint
with
the
food
and
drug
administration
that
a
certain
food
is
on
the
shelves
that
is
unsafe,
and
the
food
and
drug
administration
says:
no,
we're
not
going
to
start
any
action
against
that;
you're
just
wrong.
is
that
subject
to
review?
justice
white
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
that's
just,
any
member
of
the
public
has
got
the
same
standing
as
everybody
else,
i
suppose?
justice
white
what
about
my
example?
justice
white
you're
submitting
on
your
brief
the
question
of
the
agency's
jurisdiction?
justice
white
well,
i
thought
it
claimed
it
didn't
have
any
jurisdiction.
justice
white
well,
you
haven't
orally
argued
that,
have
you?
justice
white
i
didn't
understand
that.
