justice
stevens
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
your
position
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
the
government's
position
in
the
florida
power
&
light
case
involving
atomic
energy,
where
there
you
took
the
position
that
there
was
reviewability
in
the
court
of
appeals?
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
the
action
was
not
reviewable.
justice
stevens
no,
this
was
inaction,
refusal
to
institute
a
proceeding.
justice
stevens
it
did
not
in
that
case.
justice
stevens
mr.
geller,
what
if
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
your
position,
that
the
explanation
given
by
the
agency
had
been
simply,
we
have
no
jurisdiction,
that
they
had
said
nothing
more?
what
then
would
your
position
be?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
asking
you
would
it
be
reviewable
if
that's
what
they'd
said
and
nothing
more?
justice
stevens
well,
you
don't
support,
as
i
understand
your
brief,
you
do
not
support
the
view
that
they
don't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
if
they
exercise
their
discretion
to
proceed
here,
you
say
that
would
be
in
excess
of
their
statutory
authority?
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
an
answer.
justice
stevens
if
they
had
done
exactly
the
opposite
and
gone
forward
with
an
investigation
as
requested,
you
say
they
would
have
violated
the
statute,
or
do
you
not?
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
still
not
quite
clear
what
your
position
is.
they
said...
the
first
paragraph
of
their
letter
said
they
don't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
that
statement?
justice
stevens
you
agree
with
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
geller,
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
take
that
position,
which
is
directly
opposed
to
the
position
you
took
in
the
florida
power
&
light
case.
you
said
the
jurisdiction
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
that
precise
decision.
justice
stevens
that
was
an
agency
inaction
case
in
which
the
government--
justice
stevens
--mr.
geller,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you
so
often.
i
do
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
no
law
to
apply
argument.
you're
not
arguing
that
if
they
did
think
they
had
jurisdiction
and
if
they
decided
to
exercise
their
discretion
and
then
they
went
ahead
to
bring
a
proceeding,
that
there
would
not
be
law
to
apply
in
the
enforcement
field,
but
rather
that
there's
no
law
to
apply
to
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
institute
a
proceeding?
justice
stevens
it's
the
latter
that
you're
contending?
justice
stevens
so
that
whenever
there's
a
statute
which
does
not
describe
the
circumstances
under
which
enforcement
proceedings
should
be
started,
your
no
law
to
apply
rule
would
apply?
justice
stevens
is
there
any
statute
in
which
congress
has
provided
law
on
that
decision?
justice
stevens
mr.
kristovich,
can
i
interrupt,
please.
you
say
they
ignored
the
bachowski
case,
but
hr.
geller
said
that's
the
one
case
in
which
the
court
identified
law
to
apply
to
the
decision
to
bring
an
not
to
bring
an
enforcement
proceeding.
justice
stevens
but
do
you
think
the
presumption
is
equally
strong
in
favor
of
review
cf
a
decision
not
to
bring
a
proceeding
as
there
is
review
of
some
action
that
affects
rights?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
his
basic
distinction,
his
basic
point
is
there's
a
big
distinction
between
refusing
to
act
and
deciding
to
act.
justice
stevens
where
are
the
rules
that
tell
us
whether
they
have
acted
correctly
in
refusing
to
enforce
the
statute?
he
says
there's
no
law
to
apply
to
that
decision.
what
is
the
law
that
governs
that?
justice
stevens
but
then
every
nonenforcement
decision
has
law
to
apply
to
it?
whenever
you
can
find
a
violation,
you're
really,
i
think,
saying
that
there's
law
to
apply
if,
after
making,
the
decision
to
enforce,
there's
some
law
deciding
how
to
decide
the
case.
justice
stevens
and
what
standard
would
determine
whether
the
agency
had
failed
to
act
properly
if
they
refused
to
take
action?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
would
apply?
justice
stevens
why
wouldn't
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
apply
to
this
case?
justice
stevens
well,
could
not
this
decision
be
held
to
be
non-arbitrary
even
if
they
gave
the
wrong
reason
when
they
refused
to
go
forward?
say
we
think
it
makes
sense
not
to
interfere
with
state-mandated
procedures
like
that.
say
we
thought
that,
even
though
they
didn't
articulate
it
very
well
in
their
response.
would
that
require...
what
should
we
do
then?
justice
stevens
correct,
yes.
and
then
you
would
lose?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
state
of
the
record
on
the
effects
of
using
the
drugs.
as
i
understand
it,
your
allegations
in
your
complaint
are
a
little
more
powerful,
you
might
say,
than
those
in
the
letter
asking
for
agency
action.
do
we
judge
the
likelihood
of
misuse
of
the
drugs
on
the
basis
of
what
was
submitted
to
the
agency
or
by
what
you've
alleged
in
your
complaint
after
they
decided
not
to
enforce?
justice
stevens
well,
the
letter
to
the
agency
more
or
less
says
there's
an
absence
of
consensus
and
there's
a
possibility
that
they
might
be
misused
in
particular
cases,
rather
than
that
there's
a
probability.
i
think
there's
a
difference.
