the
agency
did
consider
this.
justice
marshall
the
agency
considered
it
and
did
what
any
legal
body
would
do,
said:
we
find
no
jurisdiction.
i
say
that
in
a
lot
of
court
opinions.
justice
marshall
so
they
did
say
it.
they
did
consider
it.
justice
marshall
well,
i'm
objecting
to
you
saying
they
didn't
consider
it.
justice
marshall
they
didn't
consider
it
the
way
you
wanted
them
to
determine.
justice
marshall
and
you're
unhappy.
justice
marshall
and
i
don't
know
what
section
of
the
constitution
protects
that.
justice
marshall
could
you
have
brought
this
case
in
the
state
court
against
a
state?
justice
marshall
could
you
have
brought
the
case
in
a
state
court
against
a
state,
saying
you
can't
use
this
horrible
drug?
justice
marshall
i
didn't
say
that,
i
said
against
a
state,
to
enjoin
the
state
from
using
this
horrible
drug.
justice
marshall
but
you'd
much
rather
bring
it
up
here.
justice
marshall
you'd
much
rather
take
this
sideways.
