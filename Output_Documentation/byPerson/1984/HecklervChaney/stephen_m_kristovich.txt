mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
food
and
drug
administration
aggressively
asserts
its
jurisdiction
over
the
use
of
drugs
on
state
prisoners
in
clinical
and
drug
investigations.
fda
aggressively
asserts
its
jurisdiction
with
regard
to
drugs
produced
to
kill
animals,
to
ensure
that
those
drugs
will
produce
a
quick
and
painless
death.
in
footnote
34
at
page
45
of
its
brief,
the
government
concedes
that
if
the
manufacturers
of
lethal
injection
drugs
promoted
these
drugs
for
this
purpose
fda
would
assert
its
jurisdiction,
would
regulate
these
drugs,
and
would
investigate
and
make
sure
that
they
produced
a
quick
and
painless
death.
those
three
examples
are
no
different
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
when
all
is
said
and
done,
the
only
reason
the
government
has
refused
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
over
lethal
injection
drugs
is
because
it
is
a
state-mandated
activity.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
underlying
the
statute,
that
gives
any
indication
that
congress
intended
state-mandated
activities
to
be
exempt
from
fda's
jurisdiction.
in
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
rutherford,
the
court
held
that
the
fda
had
jurisdiction
over
laetrile,
even
though
17
states
had
passed
statutes
allowing
the
prescription
and
use
of
laetrile
by
terminally
ill
cancer
patients.
fda
itself,
with
regard
to
the
use
of
drugs
on
state
prisoners
in
clinical
drug
investigations,
rejected
arguments
by
the
states
that
fda
somehow
was
intruding
into
state
penal
systems.
in
short,
fda's
argument
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction
here
is
nothing
more
than
an
abnegation
of
its
statutory
authority.
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
fda
should
take
some
particular
regulatory
action
with
regard
to
lethal
injection.
rather,
the
issue
is
a
narrow
one,
and
that
issue
is
to
what
extent
will
there
be
judicial
review
of
an
executive
branch
abnegation
of
a
congressional
mandate
of
enforcement
responsibility.
the
administrative
procedure
act
provides
that
all
final
agency
action
is
subject
to
judicial
review
unless
it
is
precluded
by
statute
or
unless
the
action
is
committed
by
law
to
agency
discretion.
this
court
in
abbott
laboratories
v.
gardner
held
that
there's
a
strong
presumption
that
favors
judicial
review
of
all
agency
actions.
mr.
geller
today
argues
that
the
agency
has
a
right
to
protect
its
limited
resources
with
regard
to
enforcement,
that
it
must
jealously
preserve
these
resources,
that
it
has
budgetary
constraints
that
limit
its
actions.
that
is
all
very
true,
but
that
is
not
the
reason
why
the
fda
denied
the
respondent's
administrative
petition
here.
that
argument
was
not
made
in
the
district
court,
that
argument
was
not
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
simply
a
post
hoc
rationalization
of
counsel
that
is
made
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
by
the
solicitor
general's
office.
in
any
event,
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
an
everyday
individualistic
retail-type
enforcement
decision
in
which
an
agency
will
have
to
make
a
determination
whether
it
should
allocate
its
resources
for
that
enforcement
action
or
not
and
what
has
happened
here.
what
we
have
here
is
a
wholesale
categorical
class-like
determination
by
the
fda,
based
upon
statutory
interpretation
and
based
upon
what
it
calls
notions
of
federalism,
that
it
just
simply
does
not
have
jurisdiction
and
will
not
exercise
jurisdiction.
this
court
in
office
employees
v.
national
labor
relations
board
held
that
the
secretary
of
labor
could
not
renounce
jurisdiction
over
an
entire
category
of
employees,
that
being
unions
when
they
were
acting
as
employees.
this
court
clearly
has
jurisdiction
to
review
an
agency
determination
that
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
statute
to
take
an
enforcement
action.
the
government
also
argues
that
the
agency
enforcement
decision
here
is
like
that
of
a
criminal
prosecutor.
criminal
prosecutions
are
brought
for
the
protection
of
society
at
large,
rather
than
any
particular
individual,
and
no
individual
has
standing
to
request
that
a
particular
prosecution
be
brought.
but
this
court
has
stated--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
of
course
there
are
clear
broad
social
questions
involved
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
no,
your
honor.
i
was
merely
stating
that
criminal
prosecutions
are
brought
for
the
protection
of
society
at
large.
the
act
here,
of
course,
was
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
at
large.
but
it
was
also
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
individuals,
those
individuals
who
use
drugs.
administrative
proceedings,
unlike
criminal
prosecutions,
have
a
direct
impact
on
individuals,
the
individuals
for
whom
congress
enacted
the
statute
either
to
benefit
or
to
protect.
the
government
studiously
ignores
this
court's
decision
in
dunlop
v.
bachowski,
in
which
the
court
held
that
the
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
judicial
review
applies
with
equal
force
to
agency
enforcement
decisions.
in
that
case,
the
bachowski
case,
the
court
held
that
the
secretary
of
labor
had
failed
to
carry
his
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
preclude
judicial
review
of
his
decision
not
to
enforce
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act.
even
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
government
for
their
claim
of
an
absolute
immunity
from
judicial
review,
such
as
the
southern
railway
case,
do
not...
support
that
preposition.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
it
will
not
lightly
interpret
a
statute
to
confer
upon
an
agency
unlimited
discretion.
the
government
argues
that
if
a
court
were
to
review
its
enforcement
decision
here
it
would
do
violence
to
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
well,
he
tried
to
distinguish
it
away,
your
honor.
but
he
ignores
the
clear
language
in
the
case
that
is
applicable
also
to
this
case,
and
that
is
the
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
judicial
review
of
agency
actions,
which
also
applies
to
enforcement--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--well,
as
this
court
stated
in
marshall
v.
jerrico,
the
decision
to
enforce
or
not
to
enforce
often
places
a
significant
burden
on
the
statutory
beneficiary,
as
is
shown
by
this
case.
the
agency's
decision
not
to
enforce
the
statute
places
an
enormous
burden
on
the
respondents.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
your
honor,
the
law
to
apply
is
in
the
express
language
of
the
statute
itself,
the
1972
fda
policy
statement,
and
fda
and
court
interpretations
of
the
statute.
we
would
say
there
is
law
to
apply
because
the
statute
sets
forth
criteria
for
determining
noncompliance
with
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
well,
your
honor,
in
the
dunlop
v.
bachowski
case
this
court
held
there
was
law
to
apply
because
you
could
look
at
the
secretary
of
labor's
decision
and
determine
whether
he
was
correct
in
saying
there
was
no
probable
cause
that
there
was
a
violation
and
no
probable
cause
that
that
violation
had
affected
the
outcome
of
the
union
election.
in
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park,
the
court
said
there
was
law
to
apply
because
it
could
look
at
the
secretary
of
transportation's
decision
and
make
a
determination
whether
it
was
rational
in
saying
that
all
feasible
and
prudent
planning
had
been
done
and
that
there
were
no
steps
that
could
be
taken
to
minimize
the
impact
of
the
highway
in
that
case.
we
disagree
with
mr.
geller's
assertion
that
the
law
to
apply
goes
to
whether
there
are
standards
to
judge
the
fda's
exercise
of
enforcement
discretion.
put
even
if
you
take
that
as
being
the
test...
and
we
don't
think
pachowski
makes
it
the
test
or
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park
makes
it
the
test.
but
even
if
you
take
that
as
the
standard,
there
is
law
to
apply
here.
section
336
of
the
act...
and
i
will
read
it
because
it
is
very
brief...
states:
"nothing
in
this,
chapter
shall
be
construed
as
requiring
the
secretary
to
report
for
prosecution
or
for
the
institution
of
libel
or
injunction
proceedings
minor
violations
of
this
chapter
whenever
he
believes
that
the
public
interest
will
be
adequately
served
by
a
suitable
written
notice
or
warning.
"
we
think
section
336
indicates
the
clear
congressional
intent
that,
with
regard
to
major
violations
of
the
statute,
the
fda
has
no
enforcement
discretion
to
ignore
its
enforcement
powers.
if
congress
had
intended
section
336
to
apply
to
major
violations,
it
would
not
have
restricted
it
to
minor
violations.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
yes.
yes,
we
are,
your
honor.
the
1972
preamble--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--it
was
a
preamble
to
a
proposed
rulemaking
that
was
never
adopted.
but
the
government
in
the
courts
below
conceded
that
this
preamble
is
still
in
effect.
in
fact,
under
fda
regulations
it
is
an
advisory
opinion,
and
under
21
cfr
section
10.85(e)
the
fda
is
obligated
to
comply
with
it
unless
it
is
amended
or
revoked.
it
has
not
been
amended
or
revoked.
and
that
preamble
states:
"where
the
unapproved
use
of
an
approved
new
drug
becomes
widespread
or
endangers
the
public
health,
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
obligated.
"
--and
that's
the
term
they
use...
"obligated
to
investigate
it
thoroughly
and
to
take
whatever
action
is
warranted
to
protect
the
public
health.
"
what
respondents
ask
is
that
fda
live
up
to
this
preamble,
that
they
do
what
they're
obligated
to
do,
that
they
investigate
the
use
of
these
drugs,
and
that
they
take
whatever
action
is
warranted
to
protect
these
prisoners
from
what
the
uncontroverted
evidence
in
the
record
shows
may
be
a
painful,
agonizing,
excruciating
death.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
an
electric
chair
is
not
a
device
under
the
statute,
because
it
is
not
promoted
or
intended
by
its
makers
to
be
used
in
the
diagnosis,
the
cure,
the
mitigation,
or
the
prevention
of
disease.
it
has
no--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--it
certainly
would.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
no,
we
are
not,
your
honor.
we
are
relying
on
the
definition
for
drug,
the
definition
i
just
gave
you.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
justice
rehnquist.
i
assume
it
does
not.
justice
o'connor,
we
are
not
arguing...
and
judge
wright's
opinion
i
do
not
think
can
be
read
to
mean...
that
fda
has
jurisdiction
over
mace.
it
has
jurisdiction
over
chloroform.
mace
is
not
intended
by
its
manufacturers
to
have
a
medical,
healthful,
therapeutic
benefit.
the
drugs
here
that
are
used
for
lethal
injection
do
have
those
benefits
and
are
intended
to
have
those
benefits.
it
is
the
government's
argument
for
absolute
immunity
from
judicial
review
that
is
anathema
to
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine.
without
judicial
review
of
agency
action,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
agencies
will
observe
the
congressional
mandates
that
the
statutes
provide
for
them,
and
there
is
a
chance
that
the
goals
of
congress
can
be
negated
or
frustrated
by
agency
inaction.
in
short,
the
strong
presumption
that
favors
judicial
review
of
agency
action
applies
to
this
case,
and
there
is
law
to
apply,
given
in
section
336
of
the
act,
given
in
the
preamble,
the
1972
preamble,
and
in
other
provisions
of
the
act.
section
352
of
the
act
provides
that
a
drug
shall
be
misbranded
unless
its
labeling
bears
adequate
directions
for
use
and
adequate
warnings
against
dangerous
uses.
fda
concedes
that
there
has
been
no
new
drug
application
approved
by
it
for
any
of
these
drugs.
consequently,
the
labeling
cf
these
drugs
do
not
bear
adequate
directions
for
use
as
lethal
injections,
and
they
are
misbranded
under
the
statute.
section
331(b)
of
the
act,
which
you
will
not
find
any
reference
to
in
the
government's
briefs,
provides
that
a
misbranding
in
interstate
commerce
is
prohibited.
the
government
concedes
and
the
court
below
found
that
these
drugs
are
manufactured
for
distribution
and
use
in
interstate
commerce.
therefore,
we
have
a
misbranding
of
a
drug
and
we
have
the
misbranding
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
jurisdictional
nexus
for
fda
jurisdiction
is
met.
in
addition,
section
331(k)
of
the
act
provides
that
it
would
be
prohibited
to
misbrand
a
drug
while
it
is
held
for
sale
after
shipment
in
interstate
commerce.
the
"held
for
sale"
provision
is
a
term
of
art.
it
does
not
mean
technically
that
the
drug
has
to
be
sold.
it
merely
means
distributed
to
the
consumer
or
the
user.
this
court
in
united
states
v.
sullivan,
said,
and
i
will
quote:
"the
words
of
paragraph
(k),
while
such
article
is
held
for
sale
after
shipment
in
interstate
commerce,
apparently
were
designed
to
fill
this
gap
and
to
extend
the
act's
coverage
to
every
article
that
had
gone
through
interstate
commerce
until
it
finally
reached
the
ultimate
consumer.
"
several
courts
have
held
that
the
section
(k)
provision
merely
means
that
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
have
been
used
and
it
applies
all
the
way
from
the
point
of
manufacture
up
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
in
addition
to
the
express
language
of
the
statute
and
in
addition
to
the
1972
preamble,
fda
interpretations
and
court
interpretations
also
provide
law
to
apply
in
this
case.
the
cases
have
uniformly
condemned
the
unapproved
use
of
approved
drugs
outside
the
practice
of
medicine,
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
here,
an
unapproved
use
of
a
drug
outside
the
practice
of
medicine.
in
addition,
as
i've
already
noted,
fda
vigorously
asserts
its
jurisdiction
over
drugs
used
to
produce
death
in
animals,
it
vigorously
asserts
its
jurisdiction
over
state
prisoners
who
are
used
in
clinical
drug
investigations.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
statute
or
in
the
congressional
history
that
indicates
congress
did
not
intend
that
this
enforcement
decision
here
is
not
reviewable,
and
the
government
has
not
cited
anything
either
in
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
its
claim
of
nonreviewability
here.
in
fact,
in
abbott
laboratories
v.
gardner
this
court
cited
the
department
of
justice
memorandum
that
was
read
on
the
house
floor
in
1938
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed,
in
which
the
justice
department
at
that
time
argued
that
the
special
review
provisions
set
forth
in
section
371
of
the
act
were
not
really
needed,
because
even
without
these
provisions
there
would
be
judicial
review
if
an
aggrieved
party
wanted
to
complain
about
an
action
taken
by
the
agency.
it's
ironic
that
the
government
here
is
now
taking
the
opposite
position.
in
short,
the
government
has
failed
to
meet
its
heavy
burden
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
judicial
review
of
its
nonenforcement
decision
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
no,
that's
fine,
your
honor,
please.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
that
is
not
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
your
honor,
a
criminal
prosecution
is
brought
for
the
benefit
of
society
at
large,
not
for
the
benefit
of
any
particular
individual.
no
particular
individual,
consequently,
has
standing
to
request
that
a
particular
prosecution
be
brought.
administrative
proceedings,
on
the
other
hand,
have
a
direct
impact
on
those
individuals
for
whom
the
statute
was
enacted,
either
to
protect
or
to
confer
a
benefit
upon.
those
people
therefore
have
standing
to
request
a
particular--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--your
honor,
if
an
individual
could
meet
the
standing
requirements--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--well,
your
honor,
certainly
in
this
case
only
the
prisoners
have
standing
to
complain
about
the
use
of
lethal
injection
drugs.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
your
honor,
i
believe
if
an
individual
in
that
case
could
show
that
there
was
a
likelihood
that
he
would
be
in
cured
by
that
drug,
that
therefore
he
could
file
a
citizen's
petition,
as
respondents
did
here,
with
the
agency
and
request
that
they
take
action.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
well,
your
honor,
that
case,
unlike
our
case,
would
be
an
individual
retail
type
enforcement
decision,
at
which
point
mr.
geller's
arguments
about
marshalling
the
agency's
resources
would
come
into
play.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
does
but
we
are
also
arguing--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question,
the
court
then
would
be
saying
that
the
fda's
decision
here
was
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
are
arguing
two
things,
though:
one,
that
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious;
but
aside
from
that,
it's
a
complete
abnegation
of
its
statutory
duty,
a
renunciation
of
jurisdiction,
which
in
essence
is
an
attempt
by
the
agency
to
take
upon
themselves
the
congressional
right
of
repeal,
which
is
beyond
their
delegated
powers,
not
unlike
the
office
employees
v.
labor
board
case,
and
that,
if
the
court
so
finds,
that
it
will
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
direct
the
agency
to
assert
its
jurisdiction--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--your
honor,
the
agency--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--that's
right,
your
honor,
that
was
the
basis
for
their
decision.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
only
to
the
extent
that
they
said
they
had
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
yes,
your
honor.
well,
they
did
consider
it
to
the
extent
they
said
they
had
no
jurisdiction.
but
they
did
not
consider
it
to
the
extent
of
looking
at
the
affidavits
that
were
submitted
at
the
agency
level--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--that's
right,
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
well,
your
honor,
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
provides
that
agency
actions
shall
not
be
arbitrary
and
capricious,
protects
us
here.
and
we
would
argue
that
their
decision,
in
addition
to
being
a
renunciation
of
the
congressional
mandate,
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
it
was
so
because
of
their
prior
enforcement
of
the
act
with
regard
to
drugs
used
to
produce
death
in
animals,
with
regard
to
the
assertion
of
their
jurisdiction
over
state
prisoners
used
in
clinical
drug
investigation.
in
support
of
their
administrative
petition,
respondents
submitted
affidavits
from
leading
anesthesiologists
that
stated
that
there
is
no
expert
consensus
founded
upon
substantial
evidence,
as
required
by
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
that
these
drugs
will
produce
a
quick
and
painless
death.
fda
disregarded
those
affidavits
and
described
them
as
being
not
pertinent.
in
the
letter
from
the
fda
commissioner
rejecting
respondents'
petition,
fda
stated,
nevertheless,
that
they
considered
there
to
be
no
danger
to
the
public
health
here.
well,
the
uncontroverted
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
that
the
use
of
these
drugs
on
approximately
450
prisoners
will
produce
an
excruciating,
slow,
painful
and
tortuous
death.
because
this
case
was
decided
below
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
respondents'
allegations
in
their
complaint
of
a
substantial
likelihood
of
a
slow,
painful
death
must
be
assumed
to
be
true.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
well,
your
honor,
in
the
o'brien
case
which
mr.
geller
alluded
to
mr.
o'brien
brought
a
1983
action.
but
this
particular
case
against
the
food
and
drug
administration
would
have
to
have
been
brought
in
federal--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--your
honor,
i
suppose
under
a
1983-type
argument
such
a
case
could
be
brought.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
well,
your
honor,
we
thought
it'd
be
better
to
go
to
the
agency
itself,
the
agency
that
has
jurisdiction
over
drugs,
the
agency
with
the
expertise
to
investigate
these
drugs,
to
determine
whether
they
will
do
what
they
are
being
touted
as
doing.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
that's
right.
but
we
are
not
making
an
eighth
amendment
argument
here.
it's
clearly--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--purely
a
statutory
argument.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
allegations
are
the
same
in
both,
both
in
the
complaint--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--your
honor,
the
letter
to
the
agency
had
attached
to
it
the
affidavits
from
the
anesthesiologists
that
said
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
that
these
drugs
will
produce
an
excruciating
death.
and
it
is
the
application
we
made
to
the
agency
with
the
exhibits
attached
that
this
court
needs
to
review.
in
conclusion,
the
uncontroverted
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
that
these
drugs
will
produce
the
quick
and
painless
death
that
they
are
being
promoted
and
touted
as
doing.
fda
has
failed
to
carry
its
heavy
burden
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
judicial
review
of
its
nonenforcement
decision
here.
respondents
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
that
it
direct
the
agency
to
do
what
it
should
have
done
in
the
first
place,
and
that
is
merely
to
look
at
these
drugs,
to
conduct
an
investigation,
to
make
a
determination
whether
in
fact
these
drugs
will
produce
a
quick
and
painless
death.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
we're
merely
asking
that
this
be
sent
back
to
the
agency
so
that
they
can
examine
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
it
did,
your
honor,
and
we
would
request
that
this
court
affirm
judge
wright's
opinion
which
held
that
they
did
have
jurisdiction.
so
we
would
ask
this
court
to
find
it
does
have--
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
--well,
your
honor,
i
thought
i
had.
i
thought
i
had.
mr.
stephen
m.
kristovich
well,
if
i
haven't,
we
are
certainly
making
that
request,
that
this
court
find
that
it
does
have
jurisdiction
and
that
it
exercise
this
jurisdiction,
and
that
it
do
the
investigation
that
it
should
have
done
in
the
first
place.
thank
you,
your
honor.
