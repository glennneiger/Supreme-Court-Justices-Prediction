mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
my
argument
is
promised
on
the
assumption
that
the
constitution
requires
some
form
of
notice,
and
our
argument
is
essentially
that
the
notice
that
the
department
of
public
welfare
sent
out
in
december,
1981,
in
fact
met
and
exceeded
the
constitutional
requirement
of
due
process.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
only
insofar
as
massachusetts
exceeded
those
regulatory
requirements
and
we
allowed,
if
someone
appealed,
we
continued
their
benefits,
if
they
appealed
for
any
reason.
the
regulation
is
a
little
bit
more
restrictive,
but
in
this
case
if
anyone
filed
an
appeal
from
this
notice,
their
benefits
were
continued
pending
that
appeal
and
pending
the
final
decision.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
in
december,
1981,
the
massachusetts
department
of
public
welfare
mailed
a
notice
to
16,000
food
stamp
recipients
that
were
affected
by
the
change
in
federal
law.
the
lower
courts
found
this
notice
unconstitutional
because
of
its
vocabulary,
because
of
its
print
size,
because
of
its
ink
quality,
and
because
it
did
not
contain
individualized
financial
information
for
each
particular
household.
the
courts
used
this
notice
to
set
forth
unworkable
and
burdensome
standards
to
govern
future
notices
of
legislative
change
which
are
not
rooted
in
the
due
process
clause.
first,
the
notice
was
accurate,
and
it
conveyed
the
information
about
the
change
in
federal
law
in
a
correct
manner
and
in
a
manner
that
was
in
accordance
with
the
secretary's
regulatory
requirements.
secondly,
the
notice
used
language
that
is
commonly
on
food
stamp
forms
and
notices,
and
most
important,
language
that
was
understood
by
the
three
class
representatives
in
this
particular
case.
third,
there
was
no
finding
that
any
particular
recipient
did
not
ultimately
receive
all
the
benefits
to
which
they
were
entitled.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
yes.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
we
did
not.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
we
did
not.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
finally,
even
if...
if
someone
had
a
question
or
wanted
to
challenge
the
application
of
this
legislative
action
to
their
particular
case,
the
procedural
safeguards
that
were
afforded
to
all
of
the
people
that
received
this
notice
were
extensive.
page
2
of
the
notice,
which
is
at
page
5
of
your
joint
appendix,
is
entitled
"important
notice,
read
carefully".
it
explains
that
the
federal
law
had
lowered
the
earned
income
deduction
from
20
percent
to
18
percent.
it
explained
the
effect
of
the
law
on
the
household's
benefits.
it
then
explained
in
detail
the
simple
procedure
by
which
an
appeal
could
be
claimed.
although
the
class
representatives
understood
the
language
of
this
notice,
the
district
court
applied
a
mechanical
reading
test,
a
formula
to
this
notice
to
see
whether
it
met
the
requirements
of
the
due
process
clause.
that
reading--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--they
are
the
size
and
the
exact
format,
your
honor.
of
course,
that
was
on
a
card,
and
it
was
on
a
colored
card,
but
the
size
of
the
print
and
the
style
is
an
exact
reproduction.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
there
may
have
been
some
people
that
had
difficulty
reading
it,
your
honor,
but
it
was
clearly
written.
it
was
on
a
brightly
colored
card.
it
was
entitled
"important
notice,
read
carefully",
and
then
it--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--it
was
easier
than
that,
we
submit,
your
honor.
the
language
in
there,
which
may
not
be
familiar
to
the
average
lay
person,
is
language
that
is
commonly
used
on
food
stamp
forms
and
applications,
and
commonly
part
of
the
interview
process
that
households
go
through
on
a
periodic
basis.
the
district
court
found
that
the
notice
was
unconstitutional
because
it
contained
words
such
as
"household",
"appeal",
"eligible",
and
"benefits".
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
the
district
court
applied
a
mechanical
reading
test
to
this
notice
that
reading
test
is
based
on
a
list
of
3,000
words,
so-called
familiar
words.
those
are
3,000
words
that
were
familiar
to
fourth
graders
in
1948.
any
word
that
doesn't
appear...
any
word
that
is
on
the
notice
that
is
not
on
that
list
is
considered
an
unfamiliar
word.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that
is
a
reading
test
that
is
used
routinely
to
examine
the
readability
levels
of
textbooks
used
by
educators.
it
is
a
common
reading
test
when
you
just
want
to
examine
objectively
the
grade
level
of
a
particular
passage.
it
is--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--that
is
the
dale-chall
test,
and
it
is
based
on
a
list
of
3,000
words.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
the
second
notice
in
this
case
was
issued,
your
honor,
in
response
to
the
district
court's
temporary
restraining
order.
the
first
notice
that
went
out
was
dated
11/81,
and
the
second
notice--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--was
dated
december
26th.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
the
critical
part
of
the
notice,
your
honor,
was
identical
to
the
first
notice.
page
2
was
virtually
identical
to
the
november
notice
except
for
the
fact
that
it
now
had
a
specific
date
on
it.
the
first
page
of
that
notice
was
an
attempt
to
explain
why
they
were
in
fact
receiving
a
second
notice
on
the
effect
of
the
temporary
restraining
order.
in
addition
to
everyday
food
stamp
words,
the
other
kinds
of
words
that
contributed
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
notice
were
such
words
as
"recent",
"within",
"enclosed".
the
list
of
those
words
appear
in
your
appendix,
and
we
submit
that
they
have
no
application
to
the
determination
of
whether
a
notice
informs
someone
of
a
pending
action.
the
due
process
clause
does
not
incorporate
a
statistical
reading
test.
it
merely
requires
that
a
notice
be
reasonably
designed
to
convey
the
required
information.
the
logical
extent
of
this
rule,
of
course,
would
require
states
to
match
the
reading
abilities
of
the
intended
readers
of
a
particular
notice
with
the
notice
itself.
it
imposes
burdensome
and
unworkable
requirements
on
states,
and
most
importantly,
those
are
decisions
for
state
administrators
to
make,
for
congress
to
make.
they
are
not
decisions
that
are
to
be
made
by
federal
courts,
and
they
are
not
decisions
that
are
related
to
the
construction
of
the
due
process
clause.
the
district
court
found
a
second
basis
for
holding
this
notice
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
a
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation
inherent
in
this
notice.
as
mr.
alito
pointed
out,
the
risk
of
error
in
the
implementation
of
this
across-the-board
statutory
reduction
was
minimal.
it
was
a
simple
recalculation
using
existing
factual
data.
there
were
no
disputed
factual
issues
that
came
into
play
in
the
implementation
of
this
particular
change.
and
more
importantly,
if
someone
believed
that
the
legislative
action
should
not
be
applied
to
them,
they
were
afforded
extensive
procedural
safeguards.
the
notice
stated
that
they
could
call
their
local
welfare
office
if
they
had
any
questions.
all
they
had
to
do
was
send
back
into
the
department
a
slip
of
paper
that
accompanied
the
notice,
and
thereby
claiming
an
appeal.
as
i
stated,
if
they
sent
in
that
slip
of
paper,
their
benefits
were
restored
pending
the
appeal.
the
appeal
was
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
appeal
was
subject
to
judicial
review.
so
that
the
procedural
safeguards
went
far
beyond
the
regulatory
requirements
for
one,
and
certainly
went
far
beyond
the
constitutional
requirements.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
the
regulation
requires
that
we
do
in
fact,
if
the
recipient
does
not
prevail
on
appeal,
and
the
recipient
is
so
notified
and
was
so
notified
in
this
notice,
that
they
will
attempt
to
collect
that
money
back.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
i
don't
believe
we
have,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
know.
sometimes
it
is...
the
administrative
difficulties
of
trying
to
collect
$5
outweigh
the
need
to
get
that.
the
rule
announced
below
is
essentially
this.
when
announcing
a
change
in
the
law,
a
recipient
must
be
able
to
determine
on
the
face
of
the
notice
whether
there
has
been
a
calculation
error.
as
mr.
alito
pointed
out,
this
rule
is
not
restricted
to
the
food
stamp
program.
it
is
not
even
restricted
to
public
assistance
programs
generally,
but
could
be
applied
wherever
the
government
takes
any
action
where
the
property
interest
is
implicated.
there
is...
the
due
process
clause
simply
requires
that
someone
be
on
notice
that
something
is
happening
to
them,
and
not
be
given
their
entire
case
file
so
that
they
can
check
the
computations
and
calculations
of
the
state
agency.
i
just
want
to
turn
for
a
moment,
your
honor,
to
the...
and
just
to
back
up
for
a
minute
on
the
risk
of
error,
as
i
stated
earlier,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
there
was
no
showing
that
anyone
ultimately
received
less
benefits
than
they
were
entitled
to.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
as
soon
as
a
party
files
an
appeal,
or
even
before
they
file
an
appeal,
they
have
a
right
under
the
regulations
to
review
their
entire
case
file.
the
department
is
required
to
make
available
to
them
all
of
the
records
in
their
case
file
so
that
they
can
in
fact
see
what
is
in
there
and
whether
there
are--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
and
that
is
available
to
everybody.
they
can
call.
they
don't
even
have
to
go
in,
or
certainly
they
can
go
in
and
examine
it
themselves,
before
a
hearing,
or
if
they
want
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
a
hearing
is
even
necessary.
in
the
food
stamp
program,
people
are
recertified
periodically,
and
at
the
recertification
it
is
equivalent
to
a
new
application.
for
some
households
it
is
three
months.
for
some
households
it
is
six
months.
and
for
a
very
few,
it
is
a
year.
and
at
that
recertification
period,
they
sit
down
with
a
face-to-face
interview
with
the
social
worker,
and
they
go
through
their
entire
case
file,
so
it
is
not
as
if
they
don't
have
contact
or
are
not
used
to
having
contact
with
particular
workers.
ms.

time
of

notice

this

those
16,000
people
were
people

that
had
someone
in

this
particular

to
only
households
with

income.

the
kinds
of

case
like
this
are
the
types
of
facts
that
require
deference.
they
are
not
factual
determinations
based
on
credibility,
which
is
normally
the
province
of
the
trial
judge.
they
are
predictive
kinds
of
facts.
ms.
ellen

the
first
circuit
felt
very
bound
by
that
clearly
erroneous
standard,
and
at
times
throughout
the
opinion
appeared
to
want
to
examine
it
more
closely,
but
stated
that
they
had
in
the
past
followed
that,
and
continued
to
follow
that.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
appropriate
standard
when
reviewing
this
type
of
case.
