justice
rehnquist
mr.
alito,
did
the
court
of
appeals
make
this
constitutional
decision
before
it
had
treated
whether
the
regulations
or
the
statute
might
require
it?
justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
theory
of
the
district
court's
ruling
that
unconstitutional?
justice
rehnquist
where
did
the
district
court
get
the
idea
of
a
1948
3,000-word
test?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
hitov,
how
much
of
that
prospective
injunctive
relief
remains
after
the
opinion
of
the
first
circuit?
justice
rehnquist
which
were
the
declarations
that
this
would
be...
this
was
required
by
law?
justice
rehnquist
so
that
the
governments
are
subject
to
a
declaratory
judgment
but
not
to
an
injunction.
justice
rehnquist
well,
sound
policy
reasons
based
on
something
other
than
the
statute?
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
16,000
people
received
determinations
based
on
facts
unique
to
their
case.
justice
rehnquist
what
sort
of
factual
determinations
were
these?
that
their
income
was
between
18
and
20
percent?
justice
rehnquist
and
it
is
those
two
determinations
that
you
say
were
unique
to
each
individual?
justice
rehnquist
didn't
the
first
circuit
first
look
at
the
constitution?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
defend
their
doing
that?
justice
rehnquist
but
it
says,
by
the
action
of
the
state
agency
under
any
provision
of
its
plan
of
operation.
justice
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
limit
the
generality?
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
sounds
very
circular
to
me.
not
only
that,
but
the
provision
says,
the
plan
shall
provide
for
the
granting
of
a
fair
hearing.
justice
rehnquist
the
however
language
that
you
just
read
it
seems
to
me
is
quite
consistent
with
limiting
the
notice
to
an
individual
action
type
of
thing
where
information
is
proposed
that
this
particular
recipient
may
no
longer
be
qualified,
rather
than
a
very
generalized
situation
where,
say,
congress
says
all
food
stamp
recipients
shall
be
cut
10
percent.
now,
there
your
theory
is
that
they
still
have
to
give
notice
to
everybody,
even
though
everyone
is
getting
exactly
the
same
treatment.
justice
rehnquist
what
on
earth
would
they
request
a
hearing
about
when
their
benefits
have
been
cut
10
percent?
justice
rehnquist
so
what
is
the
point
of
the
notice?
justice
rehnquist
certainly,
but
we
don't
ordinarily
think
of
congress
as
having
imposed
a
perfectly
irrational
requirement.
justice
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
point
of
requiring
a
notice
in
a
situation
where
congress
says
every
single
food
stamp
recipient
shall
be
out
by
10
percent?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
they
can
challenge
that,
i
would
think,
after
they
receive
the
amount
of
their
benefit.
the
only
purpose
of
challenging
it
before
it
seems
to
me
is
to
challenge
a
deliberate
action,
that
we
intend
to
cut
your
payments
because
this
new
evidence
is
coming
in--
justice
rehnquist
--not
because
we
intend
to
cut
your
payments
because
congress
told
us
to
cut
everybody
10
per
cent.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
one
of
the
factors
of
what
you
say
are
the
two
factors
involved
is
preexisting
determination.
it
is
not
a
new
determination
at
the
time
congress
acts.
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
congress
itself
recognized
that,
are
you
relying
on
the
language
we
have
already
talked
about?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
closest
thing
in
point
so
far
as
actual
law
as
opposed
to
legislative
history
is
the
language
we
have
discussed
in
2010(e)?
justice
rehnquist
i
was
talking
about
the
statute.
