justice
jr.
and
you
think
we
should
address
it,
mr.
alito?
justice
jr.
we
shouldn't
send
it
back
to
them?
justice
jr.
i
am
suggesting,
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
that?
justice
jr.
ought
to
decide
it.
justice
jr.
the
court's
has
already
decided
it,
hasn't
it,
below?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
ms.
janos,
may
i
ask,
there
is
a
regulation,
isn't
there,
that
requires
you
to
give
some
notice?
justice
jr.
and
also
i
gather
that
same
regulation
makes
provision
for
continuing
benefits
in
certain
circumstances.
justice
jr.
are
those
provisions
going
to
have
any
relevance
to
your
argument?
justice
jr.
they
were
continued
in
all
instances?
justice
jr.
i
see.
justice
jr.
i
am
sorry,
ms.
janos.
looking
at
that
regulation,
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
you
have
told
me
benefits
continued
in
the
case
of
all
appellants--
justice
jr.
--until
their
appeals
had
been
resolved.
but
the
regulation
seems
to
require
continuation
of
benefits,
does
it
not,
only
if
the
issue
being
appealed
is
that
food
stamp
eligibility
or
benefits
were
improperly
computed,
but
i
gather
you
didn't
limit
it
to
such
appeals,
did
you?
justice
jr.
i
see.
justice
jr.
thank
you.
justice
jr.
and
i
take
it
the
government
wouldn't
seek
to
get
back
the
payments
that
were
made
pending
resolution
of
the
appeal
even
if
the
government
prevailed.
justice
jr.
have
you
done
that?
justice
jr.
ms.
janos,
suppose
the
appeal
was
or
the
ground
that
the
benefits
were
improperly
computed.
suppose
that
is
the
appeal
that
is
made
by
a
given
appellant.
how
does
that
appellant
ever
learn,
or
when
does
the
appellant
first
learn
how
in
fact
the
benefits
were
computed?
justice
jr.
i
mean,
may
one
go
in
and
say,
look,
this
is
what
you
tell
me
i
am
now
to
get,
how
did
you
arrive
at
that
figure?
justice
jr.
he
may?
justice
jr.
did
you
say
190,000
families,
households?
justice
jr.
mr.
hitov,
do
you
agree
with
respondents
that
as
they
administer
this
program,
the
filing
of
an
appeal
automatically
results
in
the
resumption
of
the
payments
at
whatever
they
have
been
until
the
appeal
has
been
decided?
justice
jr.
reinstate.
justice
jr.
but
if
you
do,
the
payments
are
reinstated,
and
then
the
end
result
is
a
reduction
of
the...
i
think
ms.
janos
told
us
there
may
be
an
effort
to
recoup
benefits.
justice
jr.
i
gather
the
effort
to
recoup
is
rare.
justice
jr.
i
take
it
it
is
all
a
computerized
operation,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
in
some
states
it
is
not,
is
it?
justice
jr.
in
states
where
it
is
not,
it
might
take
a
little
longer,
might
it
not?
justice
jr.
well,
i
mean,
the
notice
you
got
out,
if
you
have
a
computer,
you
can
put
this
additional
information
on,
i
gather,
without
taking
much
time.
justice
jr.
but
if
it
is
not
on
there,
and
you
have
to
go
through
records
and
put
it
on
in
ink
or
something,
that
may
take
a
little
longer,
may
it
not?
justice
jr.
how
much
are
we
talking
about
with
the
individual
family
with
which
you
are
concerned,
$5
a
month?
justice
jr.
is
$10
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
food
stamps
a
given
household
may
receive?
justice
jr.
fifteen
to
20
percent.
