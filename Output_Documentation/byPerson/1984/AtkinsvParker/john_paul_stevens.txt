justice
stevens
mr.
alito,
focusing
on
that
language,
your
disagreement
is,
they
say
when
they
intend
to
deprive,
and
you
are
saying
the
correct
statement
would
be,
they
intend
to
change
the
property.
justice
stevens
which
is
not
a
deprivation.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
16,000
figure?
i
thought
there
were
only
16,000
people
involved.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
on
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
the
notice?
assume
we
get
there,
and
i
understand
your
first
argument
agrees
with
the
solicitor
general,
but
if
we
do
review
the
standard...
the
notice,
what
standard
of
review?
is
it
just
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
or
what--
justice
stevens
--the
first
circuit
applied
the
clearly
erroneous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i,
before
you
leave
the
first
point,
you
said
the
statute
required
the
notice
to
help
in
planning
and
to
correct
errors.
is
that...
what
section
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
that
is
on
page
1a
of
the
government's
brief.
it
provides
the
granting
of--
justice
stevens
--do
you
think
there
is
language
in
there
that
explains
all
that?
justice
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
if
those
two
errors
existed
or
either
of
them
existed,
that
even
without
the
statutory
change,
they
would
have
been
receiving
an
incorrect
amount?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
an
incorrect
amount.
justice
stevens
had
there
been
no
statute,
would
that
error
have
given
rise
to
any
statutory
or
constitutional
right?
justice
stevens
but
the
individual
determination
that
you
talk
about
is
a
preexisting
error
that
causes
this
effect
on
the
statute
is
put
into
effect,
or
a
preexisting
inaccuracy
in
the
records
as
to
certain
individuals?
justice
stevens
you
couldn't
get
out
a
simple
notice
saying
the
statute
has
changed
more
quickly
than
making
all
the
individual
determinations?
justice
stevens
but
your
answer
to
my
question
is
going
to
be
based
on
the
statute,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
where
do
you
find
that?
justice
stevens
such
a
hearing,
but
the
hearing
then
takes
you
back
to
the
first
clause,
which
is,
a
state
plan
of
operation
shall
provide
for
the
granting
of
a
fair
hearing
and
a
prompt
determination
to
any
household
aggrieved
by
the
action
of
the
state
agency,
right?
justice
stevens
but
isn't
the...
the
government's
argument
is
that
the
action
which
caused
the
change
was
the
action
of
the
united
states.
justice
stevens
it
says
by
the
action
of
the
state
agency.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
say
that
you
must
give
advance
notice
saying
you
must
give
a
fair
hearing,
does
it?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see
your
point.
so
you
are
saying--
justice
stevens
--you
are
saying
after
receiving
individual
notice
assumes
that
there
is
a
notice
requirement.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
say
after
receiving
individual
notice
of
agency
action,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
that
that
implies
that
there
must
be
notice
because
there
is
a
hearing,
and
it
also
implies
there
must
be
a
hearing
for
every
one
of
these
cases,
if
you
read
it
literally.
justice
stevens
but
timely
requests
a
hearing
after
receiving
individual
notice.
justice
stevens
it
is
after
he
requests
such
a
fair
hearing,
which
takes
you
back
to
the
first,
which
would
make
the
hearing
requirement
apply
to
every
family.
well,
anyway,
i--
