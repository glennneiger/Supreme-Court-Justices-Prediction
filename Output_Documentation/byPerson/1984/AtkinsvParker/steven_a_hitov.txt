mr.
steven
a.
hitov
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
three
major
points
that
the
plaintiffs
would
like
to
make
in
their
presentation
today.
the
first
is
that
the
food
stamp
act
does
indeed
require
the
type
of
individual
notice
of
reduction
or
termination
in
benefits
ordered
below,
and
that
is
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
so
that
families
who
are
about
to
experience
a
correct
reduction
in
their
benefits
can
plan
for
that.
that
has
always
been
the
structure
of
the
food
stamp
program
as
expressed
in
the
secretary's
own
regulations.
the
second
reason
for
this
informative
notice
is
so
that
families
who
are
about
to
be
incorrectly
reduced,
or
who
believe
from
what
they
have
been
told
that
they
are
about
to
be
incorrectly
reduced,
can
challenge
that
reduction
and
prevent
those
benefits
from
being
reduced
while
they
are
going
through
a
hearing
on
that
issue.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
they
did
not
articulate
the
first
ground,
your
honor.
they
specifically
said
that
it
cannot
be
the
case
that
a
person
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
given
notice
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
but
not
be
given
enough
information
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
should
request
a
hearing.
that
was
in
the
first
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
i
can't
say
for
certain,
your
honor,
in
each
case
of
the
record,
but
it
is
the
common
law
stated
policy
that
they
will,
as
ms.
janos
stressed,
reinstate,
not
continue--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--but
reinstate
benefits
if
they
have
already
terminated
them
and
then
somebody
requests
an
appeal,
within
a
specified...
within
a
very
short
specified
time,
within
ten
days
of
whatever
date
is
on
the
notice.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that's
right.
the
regulations
call
for
an
effort
to
recoup
the
money
paid
between
the
date
when
the
notice
and
the
reduction,
and
reduction
was
to
take
effect.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
am
not
the
one
to
answer
that
question.
the
state
recently
at
least
has
not
confided
in
me
as
to
their
recoupment
procedures.
the
second
major
point
that
we
wish
to
stress
here
is
the
prospective
injunctive
relief
issued
by
the
district
court--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
that
is
7
usc
section
2020(e)(10).
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
i
know
for
certain
that
it
is
included
on
page
1a
of
our
brief,
the
red
covered
brief,
of
the
appendix.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
if
i
might,
i
would
be
happy
to
address
that
either
now,
your
honor,
or
i
might
just
finish
my
synopsis
and
then
that
would
be
my
first
point.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
so
our
second
point
in
the
overall
presentation
is
its
prospective
injunctive
relief,
number
one,
was
quite
conservative,
and
number
two,
was
entirely
justified.
as
to
the
contents
of
future
notices,
each
of
the
families
in
this
lawsuit
received
a
notice
of
reduction
or
termination
of
their
grants
based
upon
the
specific
facts
of
their
case.
that
was
the
type
of
notice
that
was
sent
here,
and
the
district
court
merely
ordered
the
defendant,
the
department
of
public
welfare,
in
the
future
to
issue
notices
of
reduction
or
termination
that
comported
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
as
that
language
was
determined
by
the
first
circuit.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
none,
your
honor,
absolutely
none.
the
first
circuit
left
intact
in
terms
of
remedy
only
the
declarations
of
the
district
court.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that
section
2020(e)(10)
of
the
food
stamp
act
requires
advanced
notice
of
any
reduction
or
termination
except
in
the
one
specified
exception
right
there
in
the
statute.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
since
that
point,
without
a
stay
of
the
first
circuit's
mandate,
the
department
of
public
welfare
has
issued
another
notice
under
exactly
the
same
circumstances
which
did
not
comply
with
that
mandate,
but
i
will
get
to
that
also
in
the
main
body
of
my
argument.
second,
as
to
the
form
of
future
notices,
when
the
court
examines
the
record,
you
will
notice
that
no
form
has
been
dictated.
what
the
district
court
did
was
tell
the
department
of
public
welfare
to
develop
some
mechanism
to
ensure
that
future
notices
would
be
understandable
to
the
people
that
they
were
sent
to.
finally,
the
third
aspect
of
the
relief
afforded
by
the
district
court
was
the
return
of
the
benefits
withheld
in
violation
of
section
2020(e)(10)
of
the
act,
and
the
plaintiffs
will
demonstrate
that
the
return
of
these
benefits
is
in
fact
mandated
by
another
section
of
the
act,
7
usc
section
2023
(b),
not
only
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
but
also
for
sound
policy
reasons
as
well.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
no,
your
honor,
sound
policy
reasons
that
derive
directly
from
the
statute.
justice
stevens,
if
i
might
now
return
to
your
question
as
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
if
you
would
bear
with
me
for
just
one
second,
i
would
like
to
present
to
the
court
what
the
notice
did
say,
what
it
didn't
say
that
the
lower
courts
found
it
should
have
said,
and
then
discuss
where
they
derived
that...
from
where
they
derived
that
conclusion.
despite
the
fact
that
16,500
families
in
this
case
each
suffered
a
reduction
or
a
termination...
they
weren't
told
which
in
advance...
based
upon
the
individual
facts
of
their
case
unique
to
each
one
of
those
families,
the
department
sent
them
not
an
individual
notice
but
a
general
notice
which,
if
one
were
able
to
fight
through
the
language
of
the
notice,
and
if
one
were
able
to
read
it,
and
as
i
will
discuss
later,
at
least
three
people
who
testified,
including
an
expert
witness,
had
to
use
a
magnifying
glass
to
do
so--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--exactly.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
no,
your
honor.
actually,
that
was
not
the
issue
here.
the
two
facts
subset,
the
two
facts
at
issue
for
each
of
the
families
in
this
case,
and
which
were
unique
to
each
of
those
families
in
this
case,
first...
there
were
two
determinations
made
here
by
the
department
of
public
welfare.
the
first
was
that
each
of
the
families
receiving
this
notice...
as
ms.
janos
pointed
out,
it
was
less
than
10
percent
of
the
general
population.
each
of
the
families
receiving
the
notice
had
earned
income.
that
in
fact
was
often
incorrect.
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs
didn't
have
earned
income
and
yet
received
this
notice,
and
was
told
that
she
would
either
be
reduced
or
terminated.
the
second
determination
that
was
made
was
that
assuming
a
person
had
earned
income,
how
much
earned
income,
because
if
the
amount
of
that
earned
income
was
incorrect,
the
department
was
working
with
the
wrong
figure,
not
only
the
resulting
grant
would
be
incorrect,
but
the
amount
of
the
reduction
as
a
result
of
this
change
would
be
incorrect.
in
other
words,
if
there
were
an
underlying
data
base
error,
the
amount
would
have
been
magnified
for
those
people
for
whom
the
department
had
an
incorrect
amount.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
absolutely,
your
honor,
each...
i
mean,
that
is
not
to
say
that
two
members
of
the
class
didn't
have
the
same
income,
but
that
is,
of
course,
a
coincidence,
and
nothing
specific
to
this
change.
these
were
the
type
of
normal
reductions--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--a
different
incorrect
amount,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
that
is
not...
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
no,
your
honor,
not
under
the
statute.
the
statute
specifically
says
that
when
the
department
intends
to
reduce
or
terminate
benefits.
i
assume
that
congress
could
have
said
every
time
the
department
of
public
welfare
wishes
to
speak
to
a
household
they
should
give
notice,
but
i
think
that
congress
wisely
decided
that
that
was--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
any
time
the
welfare
department
works
with
a
person's
grant
they
are
making
certain
assumptions
about
that
person's
grant,
but
here
they
were
proposing...
they
weren't
proposing
to
send
the
person
a
check.
they
weren't
proposing
to
send
them
more
money.
they
were
proposing
to
take
money
away
from
them.
they
were
saying,
we
have
been
told
to
change
the
way
we
work
with
your
grant.
we
are
going
to
take
some
of
what
we
are
now
giving
you
away
from
you,
and
we
are
doing
it
based
on
two
assumptions.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
you
only
knew
that
if
you
knew
that.
it
is
not...
some
people
never
knew
that.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
no,
your
honor.
they
certainly
knew
that
when
their
food
stamps
showed
up,
not
at
the
point
when
they
received
notice,
but
when
their
food
stamps
actually
showed
up,
they
could
tell
that
they
got
less,
assuming
that
they
were
getting
what
they
got
last
month.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
did
not
happen.
the
record
indicates...
the
record
is
devoid
of
an
instance
in
which
a
person
was
able
to
get
any
useful
information
from
the
department
of
public
welfare.
numerous
witnesses
testified
that
they
called
their
workers,
and
the
response
was,
we
know
nothing
about
this,
it
was
done
in
boston,
you
know
more
about
it
than
we
do.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
i
am
not
certain
if
i
am
following--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
my
assumption
is
that--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
people's
mathematical--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--outside
of
the
record,
i
would
assume
that
some
people
are
proficient
at
math
and
other
people
are
not
proficient
at
math.
the
expert
witness
who
testified
in
this
case,
dr.
mark
pendick,
who
works
for
the
american
association
of
welfare
administrators...
he
is
a
person
whose
expertise
is
in
the
prevention
of
fraud
and
abuse...
testified
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
and
said
it
was
to
the
department's
benefit
to
provide
exact
notice,
and
this
is
where
i
hope
to
respond
to
your
honor's
question,
he
said
in
fact
that
the
department
should
provide
exact
calculations,
that
they
should
tell
people
exactly
what
they
are
doing
with
their
grant,
and
that
that
helps
the
department.
the
district
court
did
not
go
that
far.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
i
am
not
certain
that
that
is
necessary--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--your
honor,
i
am
not
certain
that
that
is
necessary
in
this
case.
what
the
district
court
ordered
in
this
case,
what
the
district
court
found
would
help
the
recipients
in
this
case
was
to
be
told
that
their
benefit
used
to
be
a
certain
amount,
and
it
is
going
to
be
a
new
amount,
in
other
words,
the
amount
that
the
department
proposed
to
take
away,
and
the
salient
factor
for
the
recipient,
the
thing
that
they
do
know,
whether
they
know
how
to
do
math,
whatever
their
reading
level
is,
we
propose
to
take
away
$4
or
$10
of
your
benefits
because
we
believe
you
have
$685
in
earned
income.
now--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--thank
you,
your
honor.
the
notice,
in
addition
to
saying
that
congress
has
changed
the
law
and
we
are
going
to...
the
earned
income
disregard
has
been
lowered,
which
is
what
the
notice
said
when
one
thought
through
it,
and
then
said,
we
are
either
going
to
reduce
you
or
terminate
you,
without
specifying
which,
and
then
said,
you
can
appeal
if
you
disagree
with
this
decision.
what
it
should
have
said
in
addition
to
that,
your
honor,
that
would
have
made
it
the
type
of
notice
that
congress
envisions
in
section
2020(e)(10),
is,
we
plan
to
take
away
x
amount
of
dollars,
and
we
intend
to
do
it
because
we
think
you
have
x
amount
of
earned
income,
since
that
is
what
was
at
issue
here,
was
a
reduction
based
upon
each
recipient's
earned
income.
i
should
stress
that
to
do
so
according
to
the
department's
own
expert
witness
was
free.
it
cost
not
a
nickel
to
provide
informative
notice
as
opposed
to
uninformative
notice,
to--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
important
to
stress
here
that
this
notice
is
not
floating
ephemerally
in
space.
it
is
attached
to
an
action.
it
is
a
notice
of
something.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
in
massachusetts
it
sometimes
is
and
sometimes
isn't.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
does
not
affect--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--it
shouldn't.
your
honor,
of
course,
it
could
be
made
to
take
longer,
but
there
is
no
reason
for
it
to
take
longer,
and
this
is--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--as
long
as
it
takes
the
printer.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
there,
your
honor,
again,
only
as
long...
the
difference
in
time
would
be
the
difference
in
time
that
it
take
a
printer
to
print
it
and
the
time
it
takes
a
person
to
write
it,
like
it
used
to
be
done
before.
we
have
progressed
to
computers.
because,
and
this
is
the
critical
issue,
something
is
happening
here
to
these
people's
grants.
these
were
not,
hopefully,
and
i
believe
in
this
case
they
weren't,
random
reductions
in
people's
grants
where
they
pick
out
every
fourth
person
and
said,
we
are
going
to
reduce
your
grant.
they
reduced
people's
grants
pursuant
to
figures
that
they
had
worked
with.
somebody
made
those
calculations,
and
the
notice
was
to
tell
them
about
it.
if
the
calculations
were
made,
the
person
couldn't
have
been
paid
their
food
stamps.
so
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
and
this
is
not
counsel's
opinion,
this
is
in
the
record
and
unrefuted
by
the
department,
this
is
what
an
expert
in
the
administration
of
welfare
programs
testified,
that
this...
the
time
involved
here
is
the
time
it
takes
to
write
what
you
are
doing
anyhow,
and
in
massachusetts
that,
of
course,
was
miniscule.
the
computer
expert
said,
if
there
is
enough
room
on
the
paper,
we
can
do
it.
when
asked--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
the
average
monthly
benefit,
which
is
all
i
can
speak
to,
because
different
families
have
different
certification
periods,
the
average
monthly
benefit
was
reduced
anywhere
between
apparently
$1
and
$10,
and
that
could
have
been
for
a
certification
period
of
either
one
month
or
up
to
12
months,
although
the
vast
majority
were
approximately--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--that's
the
maximum
that
can
be
established
from
the
record,
your
honor.
there
is
no...
a
range
was
given
in
the
record,
and
the
maximum
in
that
range
was
$10.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
a
month,
your
honor,
and
i
should
point
out
that
we
are
talking
about
a
2
percent
reduction
in
the
earned
income
disregard,
which
i
suspect
your
honors
have
already
discovered
is
not
the
easiest
concept
to
apply
to
the
actual
outcome
of
the
food
stamp
grant.
what
this
meant
in
terms
of
reductions,
if
the
court
looks
at
joint
appendix
page
44,
where
a
sample
page
from
the
department's
computer
printout
is
listed,
the
average
grant
reduction
is
just
about
5
percent,
it
is
4.78
percent,
as
i
recall,
in
a
family's
grant.
that
is
a...
in
terms...
we
are
talking
small
dollar
amounts,
but
we
are
also
talking
about
people
living
on
a
very--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--from
the
sheet
in
the
record,
your
honor,
$10
would
be
a
very
substantial
percentage.
this
is...
i
am
doing
an
extrapolation
in
my
head
right
now,
but
i
would
guess
15
to
20
percent.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
but
there
were,
of
course,
reductions
of
all
sizes
and
the
average
for
that
page
comes
out
to
4.78
percent,
so
the
average
family
on
that
page
lost
5
percent
of
their
benefits.
when
one
takes
it
in
terms
of
percentages
and
thinks
perhaps
of
our
salaries
or
what
have
you,
it
is
a
more
substantial
loss.
it
is
not
how
many
dollars
you
are
losing,
it
is
what
percentage
of
what
you
have,
of
course.
this
was
not
an
insignificant
reduction,
nor
was
it
an
insignificant
change.
the
defendants
have
attempted
to
paint
this
as...
we
have
just
added
a
couple
of
numbers.
they
are--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--your
honor,
congress
changed
the
provision
about
the
earned
income
disregard.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
congress
also
provided
the
mechanism
through
which
they
wished
to
have
that
implemented,
and
that
finally,
your
honor,
brings
me
back
to
your
question,
which
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
where
did
the
first
circuit
find
in
section
2020(e)(10)
the
requirements
for
this
notice?
the
first
circuit
first
looked
at...
and
the
court
is,
of
course,
invited
to
look
at
their
opinion
to
see
that
i
am
not
misrepresenting
it.
they
first
said,
advance
notice
of
any
reduction
or
termination
is
required
here.
why?
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
no,
in
our
briefs,
we
specifically
said
that
we
believe
that
was
a
mistake,
that
they
were
presented...
of
course,
as
counsel,
we
presented
them
with
both,
because
we
couldn't
be
certain
that
they
would
agree
on
the
statutory
interpretation.
they
unfortunately
looked
at
the
constitutional
issue
first
and
then
the
statutory.
my
suspicion,
without
attempting
to
defend
them,
but
my
guess
as
to
why
that
happened
is
that
there
was
a
full
blown
trial
in
this
case
in
the
district
court
that
drew
in
all
these
constitutional
issues.
and
so
the
court,
i
think,
just
went
along
with
that
without
stopping
to
say,
wait
a
minute,
if
we
are
deciding
this
on
a
statutory
ground,
there
is
no
reason
to
have
done
that.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
word
for
word
on
the
statute,
your
honor.
the
statute
says
that
whenever
a
person
receives
an
individual
notice
of
agency
action
reducing
or
terminating
benefits
is--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--that
is
the
second
clause
of
section
2020(e)(10),
your
honor.
provided
whenever
a
household
requests
such
a
hearing--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
what
that
says--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--the
statute,
though,
your
honor,
if
your
honor
reads
the
statute
through,
does
not
speak
to
the
cause
of
the
state--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--right,
the
action
of
the
state
agency
here
was
to
reduce
a
person's
grant.
they
could
have
done
that
because
they
ran
out
of
money,
which
i
am
just
taking
as
a
hypothetical,
because
it
ran
out
of
money,
because
congress
told
them
to,
because
they
had
a
misperception
of
the
facts
in
a
person's
case,
because
somebody
reported
some
information
that
either
was
or
wasn't
true.
those
are
all
things
that
would
trigger
the
agency
taking
action--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
no,
your
honor.
the
statute
under
a
state
agency
plan,
they
specifically
agreed
to
follow
the
statute.
when
the
statute
is
amended,
that
becomes
part
of
the
stage
agency
plan.
the
state
agency
plan
could
not
be
out
of
conformance
with
that.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
if
i
might,
your
honor,
it
says,
any
household
which
timely
requests
such
a
fair
hearing
after
receiving
individual
notice
of
agency
action
reducing
or
terminating
its
benefits.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
within
the
household
certification
period,
shall--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--it
explicitly
assumes.
this
is
not
an
implicit
assumption.
it
explicitly
assumes
notice,
and
it
explicitly
assumes
individual
notice.
now,
individual
notice
can
mean
two
things.
the
parties...
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
few
things
the
parties
seem
to
agree
on
here,
is
that
can
either
mean
send
the
same
piece
of
paper
to
each
house,
or
it
can
mean
send
a
notice
that
is
specific
to
that
household
to
that
house.
and
we
would
suggest
that
only
the
second
is
consistent
with
the
statute
and
the
secretary's
own
interpretation.
the
secretary
for
years
has
had
two
types
of
notices
listed
in
his
regulations,
three
types
actually,
but
two
that
are
relevant
here.
one
is
called
a
general
notice,
and
that
is
exactly
what
was
sent
out
here.
it
is
a
notice,
it
is
the
same
notice,
the
same
piece
of
paper,
and
it
is
sent
to
each
individual
household.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
it
starts
with,
for
any
household
that
timely
requests
it.
that
is
exactly
congress's--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--right,
so
that
presupposes
individual
notice--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--i
am
sorry.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
believe
this
is
important,
because
it
is
the
crux
of
the
statute.
the
hearing
is
a
requirement
in
every
case
if
a
recipient
asks
for
it.
that
is
the
first
clause.
that
does
not
trigger
the
continuation
of
benefits,
which
is
the
second
clause.
the
second
clause
says
that
after
receiving...
if
a
person
requests
a
hearing,
after
receiving
individual
notice
of
reduction
or
termination,
that
person
shall
continue
to
participate
and
receive
benefits
at
the
level
prior
to
the
notice.
so
your
honor
is
entirely
correct
that
the
purpose
of
this
individual
notice
is
in
fact
tied
to
the
hearing
that
a
person
is
going
to
request.
it
could
not
have
been
congress's
intent
to
require
a
notice,
tie
it
to
the
potential
request
for
a
hearing,
and
as
both
the
first
circuit
and
the
district
court
found,
expect
that
notice
to
be
such
that
people
had
to
guess
whether
or
not
to
ask
for
that
hearing.
congress
said
specifically
in
the
statute,
continue
to
pay
benefits
if
they
ask
for
a
hearing.
it
is
neither
sound
fiscal
management,
and
it
is
not
a
rational
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
say
we
just
intend
to
pay
benefits
at
random
to
people
when
they
guess
whether
or
not
a
proposed
action
might
or
might
not
hurt
them.
that
could
not
have
been
congress's
intent.
they
exactly
did
require
individual
notice
for
that
purpose.
that
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
overall
scheme
of
the
foodstamp
program,
which,
as
all
the
parties
agree
also,
primarily
uses
households
as
the
source
of
information.
they
are
the
ones
who
tell
the
department,
here
are
my
individual
circumstances.
the
department
then
calculates
their
grant
for
a
given
certification
period.
those
same
households
under
the
statute
are
used
as
the
primary
source
of
error
detection,
because
the
one
thing
they
know
for
certain,
or
believe
they
know
for
certain,
is
the
individual
facts
of
their
cases.
the
department
says
to
them,
we
did
this
formula,
this
formula,
and
this
formula.
they
may
not
be
able
to
follow
that.
but
the
department
says
to
them,
we
think
you
have
$685
for
an
income,
they
know
if
they
only
have
$485,
and
that
is
when
they
are
going
to
say,
i
have
a
reason
to
appeal
this,
because
they
are
working
on
the
wrong
facts.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
notice
is
required
by
the
food
stamp
act
whenever
the
agency
proposes
to
reduce
or
terminate
a
person's
food
stamp
benefits.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that
is
in
section
2020(e)(10).
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
it
says
that
any
household
which
timely
requests
a
fair
hearing
after
receiving
an
individual
notice--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--your
honor,
it
presupposes
notice
whenever--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--no,
your
honor.
that
would
neither
reduce
nor
terminate
their
grant.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
would
not--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--absolutely,
your
honor.
it
has
never
been
plaintiff's
contention.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
your
honor,
that--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--i
understand
that.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
under
the
statute,
your
honor?
if
i
can't
answer
that
without
saying
it
doesn't
reduce
a
person's
benefit
or--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--if
it
does,
you
need
notice.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that
is
what
the
statute
says,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
it
can
be
gainsaid
that
it
presupposes
notice,
that
it
doesn't
say,
you
shall
send
notice.
that
is
correct.
i
agree
with
that
statement.
what
it
does
is,
it
says
that
when--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
then
if
you
move
to
the
last
clause
of
section
2020(e)(10),
it
lists
a
specific
exception.
it
says,
however,
a
state
agency
may
act
immediately
to
reduce
or
terminate
a
household's
benefits
and
may
provide
notice
of
its
action
to
the
household
as
late
as
the
date
on
which
the
action
becomes
effective
in
those
circumstances
where
they
are
acting
on
a
direct
statement
from
the
recipient.
that
is
the
final
clause,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
first
circuit
determined
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
based
upon...
if
it
did
not
entail
a
reduction
or
termination
of
benefits,
then
it
would
not
be
covered
by
2020(e)(10).
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that
would
go
more
to
what
would
be
necessary
in
that
notice,
your
honor,
to
allow
somebody
to
know
whether
or
not
they
should
request
a
hearing.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
they
almost
definitely
would
not,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
the
point.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
if
there
are
no
factual
issues
in
dispute
as
a
constitutional
matter...
i
believe
that
what
we
are
looking
at
is
constitutional
underpinnings
here.
the
statute,
of
course,
can
require
what
the
statute
wishes
to
require.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
no.
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
for
example,
your
honor,
10
percent
presumably
of
their
preexisting
grant.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
if
the
preexisting
grant...
if
ther
department
then
out
somebody
50
percent,
or
if
they
took
their
preexisting
grant
which
was
$50,
let's
say,
and
assumed
it
was
$75,
both
of
which
are
entirely
possible,
the
person
would
in
fact
be
out
a
wrong
amount
of
benefits.
it
would
be
an
error
that
they
would
want
to
challenge.
what
we
are
saying
is
not
that
the
department
can't
go
and--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
your
honor,
what
we
have
here
is
an
individual
action
in
each
one
of
these
cases.
we
have
the
department
looking
at
each
person's
file
after
receiving
instructions
from
congress
and
saying
they
have
x
amount
of
income
and
therefore
we
are
going
to
cut
them
x
amount
of
dollars,
and
they
never
told
the
people
that.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
your
honor,
congress
itself
recognized
that
exactly
those
times
were
the
times
of
greatest
error.
the
food
stamp
act--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--no,
your
honor,
we
are
relying
on
legislative
history,
the
statements
of
senator
dole,
who
you
probably
know
is
very
active
in
the
food
stamp
program,
and
representative
foley,
who
at
that
time
was
very
active
in
the
food
stamp
program.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
there
is
one
other,
your
honor,
which
i
would
like
to
get
to,
which
is
7
cfr
of
the
secretary's
own
regulation,
the
one
that--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--in
the
statute,
your
honor,
2020(e)(10)
is
the
section.
in
the
regulation
it
is
7
cfr
section
273.12(e)(2).
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
where
the
first
circuit
found
that
if
the
notice...
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
notice
so
that
you
could
request
a
hearing,
and
then
not
intended
that
you
had
enough
information
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
request
a
hearing.
that
is
where
we
take
exception
with
what
the
solicitor
has
argued.
the
first
circuit
did
not
simply
say
because
it
violated
the
constitution
it
also
violated--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--that's
right.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
that
legislative
history,
your
honor--
mr.
steven
a.
hitov
--that
legislative
history,
your
honor,
was
in
fact
written
in
1976,
not
in
1977
when
the
language
at
issue
here
was
not
in
the
statute,
was
not
even
proposed
for
the
statute,
and
that
following
that...
the
insertion
of
that
language
in
the
statute
is
when
the
secretary
then
issued
his
regulation,
his
individual
notice
regulation
that
said
you
can
only
appeal
if
you
are
challenging
the
calculation,
and
that
is
language
that
requires,
that
you
have
information
to
challenge
that
calculation.
thank
you
very
much.
