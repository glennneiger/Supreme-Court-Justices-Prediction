justice
white
well,
if
you
send
it
back
now
without
saying
anything,
they
couldn't
say
anything
but
what
they
have
already
said.
justice
white
well,
is
this
what
the
court
below
held?
justice
white
did
they
articulate
those
very
grounds?
justice
white
--well,
how
do
you
define
when
notice
is
required?
justice
white
and
where
is
that
in
the
statute?
justice
white
what
does
it
say?
justice
white
i
know.
it
doesn't
say
when
they
are
supposed
to
have
notice.
justice
white
well,
you
imply
it.
suppose
congress
passes
a
law
and
said
food
stamps
can't
be
used
to
buy
pig
shanks,
and
so
do
you
think
you
would
have
to
send
everybody
a
notice
of
that?
justice
white
well,
it
may
not,
but
certainly
they
couldn't
buy
pig
shanks
with
it.
justice
white
so
there
are
some
kinds
of
limits,
new
limits
that
can
be
imposed
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
send
a
notice
for.
justice
white
well,
the
government's
contention
is
that
why
should
you
have
to
send
a
notice
just
to
carry
out
a
mathematical
calculation.
justice
white
that
is
their
position.
justice
white
let's
assume
that
that's
all
that
was
going
to
happen.
that
was
a
perfectly
obvious
mathematical
computation
that
nobody
could
make
a
mistake
on.
would
you
think
you
would
have
to
have
a
notice?
justice
white
it
does.
justice
white
even
though
it
absolutely
could
not
possibly
be
a
mistake?
justice
white
well,
it
isn't
what
it
says.
it
isn't
what
the
statute
says.
that
isn't
what
the
statute
says.
it
doesn't
tell
you
when
you
have
to
have
notice.
it
just
says
that
there
is
a
hearing
after
a
notice,
but
you
can't
get
that
circular...
you
can't
say
that
every...
rely
on
that
section
to
tell
you
when
a
notice
should
be
sent.
justice
white
it
certainly
assumes
that
in
some
cases
there
is
going
to
be
notice
sent,
but
it
doesn't
tell
you
which
cases
are
those.
justice
white
it
still
doesn't
tell
you...
you
disagreed
a
while
ago
that
there
are
some
cases
that
imposes
some
limit
on...
that
didn't
exist
before
in
which
there
wouldn't
have
to
be
a
notice.
