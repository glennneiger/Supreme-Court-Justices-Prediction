mr.
samuel
a.
alito
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
a
1981
amendment
to
the
food
stamp
act
that
slightly
reduces
benefits
for
households
with
earned
income.
in
order
to
implement
this
change
in
the
law,
it
was
not
necessary
for
a
state
to
gather
any
new
information
about
any
recipient
or
to
make
any
new
factual
determinations.
instead,
the
state
merely
had
to
make
a
small
mathematical
change
in
the
formula
used
for
computing
benefits.
before
the
amendment,
20
percent
of
earned
income
was
disregarded
in
calculating
benefits,
and
after
the
amendment
18
percent
of
earned
income
was
disregarded.
both
of
the
lower
courts
below
in
this
case
held
that
the
due
process
clause
prohibited
massachusetts
from
implementing
this
simple
mathematical
change
without
providing
advanced
notice
to
all
affected
recipients
explaining
to
them
exactly
how
their
new
benefit
amounts
had
been
calculated.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
the
court
of
appeals
also
found
that
the
statute
was
violated,
but
it
did
so
only
because
it
believed
that
congress
would
not
have
required
the
provision
of
a
constitutionally
defective
form
of
notice.
it
did
not
devote
any
independent
analysis
to
the
language
of
the
statute
or
to
the
legislative
history,
and
so
we
believe
that
the
statutory
issue
is
before
this
court,
and
is
fairly
subsumed
by
the
constitutional
question
that
was
raised
in
the
state's
petition.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
it
is
an
alternative
ground--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
--you
may
send
it
back
for
them
to
decide
the
statutory
issue.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
no,
i
believe
this
court
ought
to
decide
it.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
i
don't
think
the
issue
has
any
merit.
in
the
brief
time
that--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
--that's
correct.
it
has,
but
in
our
view
it
based
its
holding--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
--purely
on
the
constitutional
question,
on
which
we
believe
it
was
wrong.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
i
assume
they
would
adhere
to
their
decision
based
on
their
erroneous
view
of
what
the
due
process
clause
requires,
and
in
the
brief
time
that
is
allotted
to
me
this
afternoon,
i
want
to
argue
that
in
the
situation
involved
in
this
case,
advance
notice
is
not
constitutionally
necessary.
counsel
for
massachusetts
will
then
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
some
form
of
notice
is
necessary,
and
will
argue
that
the
notice
furnished
in
this
case
satisfied
statutory
and
regulatory
requirements.
let
me
make
clear
at
the
outset
exactly
what
our
submission
is.
we
acknowledge
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
notice
and
a
hearing
when
a
state
terminates
or
reduces
benefits
based
on
a
factual
determination
about
the
recipient.
that
is
the
situation
in
goldberg
versus
kelly.
but
we
don't
think
the
same
rule
applies
here,
where
there
is
no
new
factual
determination,
where
the
only
thing
that
had
to
occur
was
a
new
computation
using
data
that
was
already
in
the
file
and
already
in
use.
why
is
this
so?
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
restrict
congress's
authority
to
change
the
level
of
food
stamp
benefits.
a
food
stamp
recipient
has
a
property
interest
in
receiving
the
level
of
benefits
specified
by
law
at
any
particular
time.
the
recipient
doesn't
have
a
property
interest
in
getting
any
greater
benefits,
and
the
recipient
doesn't
have
a
vested
interest
in
getting
future
benefits.
so,
if
congress
amends
the
law
and
reduces
benefits,
as
it
did
in
1981,
it
does
not
deprive
the
recipient
of
property.
it
merely
redefines
the
recipient's
property
interest.
now,
since
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
who
were
food
stamp
recipients,
had
no
vested
interest
in
continuing
to
receive
benefits
at
the
pre-1981
level,
one
may
well
ask
on
what
theory
they
claimed
that
implementation
of
the
1981
reduction
deprived
them
of
property
and
triggered
the
due
process
clause.
and
their
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
as
follows.
first,
they
correctly
note
that
they
have
a
property
interest
in
getting
the
right
amount
of
benefits.
then
they
say
this
interest
is
threatened
when
the
law
is
changed,
because
the
risk
of
administrative
accident
in
calculating
benefits
increases
at
this
time
of
confusion,
and
therefore
they
say
we
are
entitled
to
advance
notice
explaining
to
us
how
our
new
benefit
level
was
calculated
so
that
we
can
double
check
the
state's
computation.
now,
the
first
thing
that
is
wrong
with
this
theory
in
our
view
is
the
premise
that
a
great
risk
of
administrative
error
occurs
when
a
simple
mathematical
change
like
that
enacted
in
1981
is
implemented.
this
premise
is
devoid
of
empirical
support,
and
it
is
intuitively
incorrect.
this
is
a
simple
mathematical
operation,
and
it
does
not
give
rise
to
a
great
risk
of
error,
but
assuming
that
it
is
correct
for
the
sake
of
argument,
let
me
briefly
explore
some
of
the
implications
of
this
theory.
first
of
all,
for
all
the
talk
about
reductions
in
food
stamp
benefits,
it
turns
out
that
it
doesn't
matter
under
this
theory
that
benefits
were
reduced
in
1981.
all
that
matters
is
that
the
law
was
changed,
and
therefore
plaintiffs
claimed
the
risk
of
error
increased,
so
the
theory
would
logically
apply
just
as
well
if
congress
had
increased
benefits
in
1981
or
if
it
had
simply
made
some
other
alteration
in
the
formula
for
computing
benefits.
second,
it
is
clear
that
this
theory
extends
far
beyond
food
stamps,
and
let
me
give
just
two
examples.
a
state
decides
to
increase
the
salaries
of
its
employees
to
reflect
an
increase
in
the
cost
of
living.
state
employees
have
a
property
interest
in
getting
the
salaries
specified
by
law.
a
change
in
the
pay
scale
is
a
mass
change
in
the
law,
so
according
to
the
plaintiffs
that
increases
the
risk
of
administrative
error.
so
under
their
theory
state
employees
are
entitled
to
advanced
notice
as
a
constitutional
requirement
explaining
how
their
new
salaries
were
calculated.
another
example.
tax
rates
have
been
charged
several
times
in
recent
years.
this
has
affected
the
amount
withheld
from
wages.
wage
earners
have
a
property
interest
in
their
wages.
charging
the
tax
rates
is
a
mass
change
in
the
law,
so
under
the
plaintiff's
theory,
wage
earners
were
entitled
to
advanced
notice
specifying
how
their
new
wage
levels
were
calculated.
and
i
think
plaintiffs'
theory
goes
further
still,
because
what
really
triggers,
what
directly
triggers
the
due
process
clause
under
that
theory
is
not
the
change
in
the
law
but
the
increase
in
the
risk
of
administrative
error.
so
what
if
the
risk
increases
for
some
other
reason?
the
state
gets
a
new
computer
program,
gets
a
new
computer.
there
is
a
fire
at
the
computer
center.
logically
the
theory
should
apply
there
as
well,
but
then
i
am
not
even
sure
why
an
increase
in
the
risk
of
error
should
matter.
what
if
the
normal,
everyday
error
rate
in
a
non-computerized
state
is
higher
than
even
the
increased
error
rate
in
a
state
like
massachusetts
when
it
implements
a
change
in
the
law?
is
the
non-computerized
state
then
under
some
kind
of
perpetual
duty
to
give
out
notice
every
time
it
issues
a
check?
all
of
this,
of
course,
is
absurd.
the
due
process
clause
requires
notice
and
a
hearing
when
there
is
a
real
and
imminent
threat
to
a
property
or
liberty
interest.
now,
there
is
such
a
threat
in
the
goldberg
versus
kelly
situation.
the
state
makes
a
factual
finding
about
the
individual
and
concludes
that
the
individual
is
ineligible
for
benefits,
but
there
is
no
such
threat
here.
the
only
threat
is
the
statistical
chance
that
an
accident
is
going
to
happen,
but
for
all
of
us
there
is
always
the
chance
that
the
government
is
going
to
accidentally
deprive
us
of
life,
liberty,
or
property.
the
elevator
in
this
building
may
crash,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
we
all
have
a
due
process
right
to
advance
notice
and
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
elevator
maintenance.
respondents...
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
the
last
word
on
this
constitutional
question
in
their
reply
brief,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
ended
up
by
conceding
virtually
everything
that
i
have
just
said.
on
page
11
of
their
reply
brief,
they
write,
"by
definition,
accidental
deprivations
of
property
by
the
government
cannot
be
predicted,
and
therefore
advanced
notice
of
them
is
not
possible,
much
less
required.
"
"this
reality,
however,
does
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
no
notice
is
due
when
the
government
intends
to
deprive
one
of
property
and
will
predictably
make
mistakes
in
doing
so.
"
but
here,
neither
massachusetts
nor
the
federal
government
intended
to
deprive
anybody
of
property.
what
they
intended
to
do
was
to
see
that
every
recipient
got
exactly
the
level
of
benefits
voted
by
congress
in
1981,
no
more
and
no
less.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
worried
only
about
accidental
deprivation
of
property,
but
in
the
case
of
such
accidental
occurrences,
advanced
notice
in
a
hearing
is
not
necessary.
post-deprivation
proceedings
are
fully
sufficient,
as
this
court
held
in
parrott
versus
taylor.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
the
congress
is
not
depriving.
they
flip
back
and
forth
in
their
argument
between
different
definitions
of
what
their
property
interest
is.
but
it
is
quite
clear,
and
i
believe
they
conceded
it
in
their
opening
brief,
that
they
have
no
property
interest
in
continuing
to
receive
benefits
at
the
1981
level.
congress
is
free
to
change
the
level
of
benefits
at
any
time,
as
this
court
held
in
united
states
railroad
board
versus
fritz,
and
in
fleming
versus
nestor,
the
court
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
under
the
social
security
system,
where
people
do
make
payments,
there
is
no
vested
right
to
future
payments,
to
future
benefits--
so,
it
must
follow
that
under
the
food
stamp
program
recipients
do
not
have
a
vested
right
in
continuing
to
receive
benefits
at
any
particular
level.
the
only
thing
they
are
worried
about
here
is
an
accidental
deprivation
of
property,
and
as
to
that
they
don't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
advanced
notice
or
a
hearing.
