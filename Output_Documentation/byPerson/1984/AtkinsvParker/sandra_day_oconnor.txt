is
that
the
dale-chall
test?
justice
o'connor
the
statute
also
does
not
attempt
to
spell
out
what
must
be
contained
in
an
individual
notice,
does
it--
justice
o'connor
--even
if
that
is
required?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
the
committee
report
in
1977
of
the
house
committee
said
hearings
would,
of
course,
be
unnecessary
in
the
absence
of
claims
of
factual
error
and
individual
benefit
computation
and
calculation.
justice
o'connor
and
you
are
saying
and
the
court
below
said
the
only
way
they
would
ever
know
that
is
if
they
had
these
figures
in
front
of
them,
the
recipients.
justice
o'connor
that
is
the
crux
of
it,
i
gather.
