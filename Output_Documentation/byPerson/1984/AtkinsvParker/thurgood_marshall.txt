there
are
two
things
that
worry
me.
one
is,
when
you
got
the
notice
of
your
money,
you
knew
something
had
happened
to
it.
you
had
lost
$5.
justice
marshall
you
mean
some
people
never
knew
that
they
got
$5
less
than
they
got
the
month
before?
justice
marshall
they
go
to
the
office,
and
it
would
have
been
explained
to
them.
justice
marshall
well,
then
you
get
to
my
second
point.
how
can
the
average
food
stamp
recipient
find
the
difference
between
18
percent
and
20
percent
of
$685?
justice
marshall
i
just
want
to
know
that
the
average
recipient
understands
percentages.
justice
marshall
you
can't?
justice
marshall
outside
of
the
record.
justice
marshall
well,
i
don'
t
understand
yet
how
an
average
recipient
can
tell
the
difference
between
18
and
20
percent.
justice
marshall
to
the
dollar.
to
the
nickel.
