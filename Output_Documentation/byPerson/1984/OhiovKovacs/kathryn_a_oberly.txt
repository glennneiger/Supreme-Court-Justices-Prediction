ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
some
of
the
court's
questions
to
the
counsel
for
the
state
of
ohio
indicate
what
we
think
is
one
of
the
mistakes
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
in--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
you're
headed
in
that
direction.
the
principal
mistake
seems
to
be
in
assuming
that
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
state
or
to
the
federal
government
in
an
enforcement
action
whether
we
get
compliance
with
the
injunction
or
whether
we
get
money.
in
fact,
it
makes
a
significant
difference.
hazardous
waste
sites
are
quite
complex
to
clean
up.
they
require
years
of
effort,
long-term
monitoring,
and
the
important
purpose
that
an
injunction
serves,
that
money
doesn't
serve,
is
that
it
keeps
the
responsible
party
present
and
under
the
supervision
of
the
court
until
the
cleanup
is
accomplished.
what
respondent
is
essentially
arguing
for
and
what
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
with
is
a
buyout
of
your
obligations
under
the
injunction
which
does
not
protect
the
public,
because
we
don't
know
at
the
time
of
the
buyout
whether
or
not
the
amount
that
the
injunction
is
exchanged
for
will
be
sufficient
to
protect
the
public
health
in
the
long
term.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
new
dumps
now
do
have
to
be
permitted
under
federal
law,
and
presumably
ohio
has
comparable
state
law.
but
that
is
not
the
case--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
but
both
federal
and
state
law
impose
basically
strict
liability
for
leaving
hazardous
wastes
behind,
even
if
it
was
done
before
the
new
permitting
requirements.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well,
the
obligation
still
lies
with
the
responsible
party,
but
then
it
falls
to
the
public
to
pick
up
the
tab
for
the
responsible
party
is--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--the
state
didn't
allow
them
to
do
it.
he
just
did
it.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
because
we've
all
learned
a
lot
more
about
the
problem.
but
in
the
meantime,
congress
has
also
chosen
to
impose
liability
for
past
disposal
practices
that
are
currently
harming
the
public.
and
that's
what
we
have--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
correct.
and
i
don't
think
the
appointment
of
the
receiver
makes
any
differences.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
kovacs
is
under
an
obligation
to
clean
up.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
receiver
wants
him
to
help
to
perform.
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
injunction
appointing
the
receiver
is
that
he
not
interfere
with
the
receiver.
we
submit
that
he
has--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
he
has
done
more
than
that.
when
he
filed
for
bankruptcy,
your
honor,
he
essentially
put
the
receiver
into
bankruptcy
because
the
receiver
had
control
of
his
assets
under
this
order,
but
the
receiver
didn't
want
to
go
into
bankruptcy.
and
so
kovacs
has
actively...
respondent
has
actively
interfered
with
the
receiver's
ability
to
carry
out
the
injunction
by
taking
the
assets
that
the
receiver
was
supposed
to
have.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that
he's
made
it
impossible
by
getting
a
ruling
from
the
bankruptcy
court
that
this
debt
is
dischargeable
and
therefore
the
receiver
has
no
assets,
whether
pre-bankruptcy
or
post-petitioner
earnings,
that
he
can
use
to
effectuate
this
cleanup.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
ohio
that
it
is
not
a
debt
that
was
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
code,
we
feel,
was
intended
to
deal
with
basically
contractual
and
commercial
obligations,
and
this
is
a
classic
example
of
something
that
is
not
contractual.
the
public
didn't
contract
with
mr.
kovacs.
there
is
no
contract
at
all
here.
there's
a
breach
and
defiance,
if
you
will,
of
a
state
court
injunctive
order.
that
is
not,
in
our
view,
something
the
bankruptcy
code
was
intended
to
address.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
we
didn't
think
those
courts
were
wrong,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
first,
of
all,
your
honor,
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case
is
that,
since
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
began,
ohio
has
been
prevented
from
going
back
to
the
state
court--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--we
think
that
he
was.
the
bankruptcy
court
disagreed.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
state
court
hasn't
had
an
opportunity...
no
court
has...
no
federal
court
in
this
proceeding
has
addressed
what
the
state
court
would
think
has
happened
to
its
injunction.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
there's
nothing...
excuse
me,
your
honor,
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
opinion
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
district
court,
or
the
sixth
circuit
to
indicate
that
those
courts
thought
that
kovacs's
obligation
had
been
satisfied.
instead,
they
said--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--what
they
said
was
that--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--they
didn't
address
that,
although
the
state
asked
them
to.
but
it
wasn't
addressed
by
any
of
the
courts.
what
they
said
was
that
this
injunction
can
be
cashed
in
for
money.
and
if
it
can
be
cashed
in
for
money,
it's
a
debt
dischargable
under
that
bankruptcy
code.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think
they
should
have
abstained
to
the
state
court
to
determine
the
scope
of
his
obligations.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
without
writing
an
opinion
explaining
they
were
doing
that.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no.
i
think
that
what's
most
important
is
that
the
state
court
that
issued
this
injunction
and
the
order
appointing
a
receiver
be
given
an
opportunity
to
decide
whether
kovacs
has
discharged
his
obligations
and
whether
or
not
he's
interfered
with
the
receiver.
and
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
have
bankruptcy
judges,
who
have
no
expertise
in
environmental
obligations,
determining
whether
or
not
that
state
court
injunction
has
been
satisfied.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
your
honor.
we
would
take
the
position
it
can't.
first
of
all,
we
don't
have
all
the
money
in
the
world.
so
that's--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--for
two
reasons
that
i
gave.
the
first
is
that
you
can't
really
estimate
what
the
cost
of
cleanup
is
going
to
be
at
the
time
an
injunction
is
entered,
and
so
an
injunction--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
you
may
not,
your
honor,
because
20
years
from
now,
you
may
find
out
that
the
remedial
measures
you
took,
the
containment
measures
to
clean
up
ground
water,
your
monitoring
of
ground
water,
proves
that
the
problem
hasn't
been
solved.
and
if
you've
left
the
defendant
buy
out
on
day
one,
the
state
and
the
public
are
left
holding
the
bag
for
any
additional
remedial
measures
that
aren't
covered.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think
that's
correct.
we
do
in
federal
cases
sometimes
settle
for
money
at
the
outset,
but
the
releases
are
worded
in
such
a
way
that
if
it
turns
out
the
money
we
settled
for
is
not
adequate
to
protect
the
problem
down
the
road,
five
years
from
now
or
ten
years
from
now
we
discover
the
contamination
has
spread
and
it's
not
been
sufficiently
contained
or
removed,
we
have
drafted
a
consent
decree
that
keeps
those
defendants
on
the
hook,
so
to
speak,
and
does
not
release
them
for
their
original
buy-out
amount.
and
the
reason
is
that
neither
the
federal
government...
we
have
three
insolvent
parties
here.
neither
the
federal
government,
nor
ohio,
nor
mr.
kovacs
has
enough
money
to
deal
with
what
is
an
enormous
problem,
not
just
at
this
site,
but
nationwide.
and
i
would
like--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
may
have
missed
the
first
part.
but
if
ohio
were
free
to
go
back
into
state
court
and
seek
contempt,
say
either
do
it,
either
perform,
or
we're
going
to
hold
you
in
contempt?
yes,
we
would
be
satisfied,
but--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--my
time
is
expired,
but--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--if
i
may
answer
the
question,
i
think
that
is
the
fundamental
error
in
this
case
in
equating
an
injunction
to
do
a
specific
act
with
just
a
desire
to
get
money.
ohio
doesn't
want
the
money.
ohio
wants
kovacs
or
the
receiver
to
perform
the
injunctive
obligation.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct,
and
that
was--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that
was
its
error,
because
by
talking
about
money,
it
was
able
to
say,
because
we're
talking
about
money,
this
is
a
debt
that
is
dischargable
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
they've
discharged
and
approved
the
discharge
of
the
entire
injunction.
so
i
don't
see
how
ohio
would
have
any
basis
for
going
back
into
state
court
on
a
contempt
motion
when
the
underlying
has
been
discharged.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think,
if
he
has
jurisdiction,
and
i
have
my
doubts
about
that,
i
think
it
would
be
something
he
should
abstain.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it
says
that
ohio,
or
a
person
in
ohio's
position
can
file
a
motion
for
abstention.
but
then
it
also
provides
that
denial
of
that
motion
is
not
reviewable
by
appeal
or
otherwise.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
but
in
the
new
bankruptcy
1984
statute
that
was
passed
this
summer...
it
provides
that
when
a
bankruptcy
court
is
called
upon
to
decide
matters
involving
laws
in
addition
to
the
bankruptcy
code,
that
those
can
go
directly
to
the
district
court,
federal
district
court.
that
still
would
not
solve
my
problem,
because
i
believe
this
belongs
in
state
court
to
determine
the
extent
of
kovacs's
obligations
under
the
injunction.
but
if
we
at
least
get
it
in
a
court
that's
slightly
more
familiar
with
balancing
bankruptcy
against
environmental
obligations,
then
i
don't
think
that
that--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
correct.
if
i
may
say
one
other
thing,
the
super
fund,
which
is
a
code
name
for
a
federal
statute
that's
been
passed
several
years
ago
to
provide
money
to
clean
up
hazardous
waste
sites,
has
been
entered
into
this
case
or
injected
into
this
case
somewhat
late,
and
no
one
has
really
properly
briefed
it,
and
i
leave
it
up
to
the
court,
but
it
may
be
that
the
court
would
wish
further
briefing
or
a
memo
about
the
effect
of
super
fund
and
federal
monies.
since
i
have
not
had
time
to
address
it,
probably
the
other
parties
won't
either.
it
may
be
helpful
to
the
court
for
someone
to
submit
something
else
on
that
issue.
we
would
be
happy
to
do
so.
