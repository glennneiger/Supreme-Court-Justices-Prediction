justice
white
it's
been
abated
now,
hasn't
it?
justice
white
is
the
receiver
still
in
possession?
justice
white
and
kovacs
is
out
of
possession.
justice
white
but
the
receiver
is
in
charge
of
the
site,
i
take
it.
justice
white
but
kovacs
couldn't
literally
carry
out
the
terms
of
the
injunction.
he
couldn't
enter
the
premises
and
take
charge
of
it
and
carry
out
acts
that
he
thought
were
justified.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
because
the
state
dispossessed
him
of
the
property
by
putting
a
receiver
in
charge.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
he's
the
one
that
sooner
or
later
took
some
steps,
but
then
the
united
states
took
some
steps
and
removed
the
toxic
wastes
from
the
surface.
is
that
right?
justice
white
well,
what
did
the
receiver
want
from
kovacs
but
money?
justice
white
i
know,
but
is
the
receiver...
the
receiver
is
in
charge
of
it.
what
does
he
want
from
kovacs?
he
doesn't
want
any
physical
help
from
him
or
any
advice.
they
want
money.
justice
white
maybe
they
should
get
it
for
that,
but
isn't
that
what
they
want
from
him?
justice
white
well,
what
acts
do
they
want
him
to
do?
they
don't
want
him
to
do
anything.
they
just
want
money.
justice
white
yes,
but
he
can't
perform
those
acts
because
the
receiver
is
in
charge.
justice
white
well,
then
what
do
you
want
out
of
him?
justice
white
but
the
receiver
would
be
as
happy
as
he
could
be
if
he
just
paid
over
the
money.
justice
white
nevertheless--
justice
white
where
is
that
injunction?
is
that
a
separate
injunction
from
what
it
was...
it's
still
the
same
injunction
that
was
issued
against
kovacs
originally,
isn't
it?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
--in
the
printed
appendix?
justice
white
but
all
he
wouldn't
do,
he
wouldn't
cooperate
in
the
receiver
trying
to
find
out
what
his
post-bankruptcy
income
was.
justice
white
well,
that
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
the
cleanup
of
the
site.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
this
is
his
bootstrapping.
assuming
you've
got
a
right
just
to
the
money,
then
you
ought
to
have
a
right
to
find
out
what
his
income
is.
justice
white
but
i
don't
know
that
that's
such
a
failure
to
cooperate
in
the
cleanup.
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
if...
do
i
read
this
order
appointing
the
receiver
correctly,
that
it
did
order
the
defendants
to
pay
over
to
the
division
of
wild
life
$75,000?
justice
white
and
that
is
dischargable?
justice
white
and,
hence,
based
on
that
claim,
you
couldn't
try
to
collect
from
his
post--
justice
white
--so
what
money
are
you
asking
from
him?
justice
white
of
course,
some
things
are
claims
but
they
aren't
dischargable--
justice
white
--under
the
bankruptcy
act.
justice
white
that
isn't
part
of
your
case
here?
justice
white
so
the
receiver
can
do
it,
because
the
receiver
has
the
obligation
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
this
injunction.
that's
what
it
says.
justice
white
well,
i
just
said
what
the
receiver--
justice
white
--so
he
wants
money?
justice
white
i
think
you
would
like
us
to
judge
the
case
as
though
a
receiver
had
never
been
appointed,
and
i
think
that
may
be
the
right
way
of
judging
it,
because
then
the
question
would
be,
is
he
still
subject
to
the
obligations
of
the
injunction?
and
then
the
question
would
be,
can
you
go
around
and
find
assets
of
his
to
carry
out
a
duty
that
could
never
be
discharged
in
bankruptcy?
justice
white
i
think
you
have
to
address
that.
you
certainly
didn't
in
your
brief.
justice
white
it
does
change
the
fact
that
his
obligation
under
the
injunction
has
been
taken
over
the
receiver
and
all
the
receiver
wants
from
him
is
money.
justice
white
he
doesn't
interfere
with
him
by...
he
interferes
with
him
unless
he
pays
the
money.
justice
white
and
what
do
you
draw
from
that
in
terms
of
the
receiver's
ability
to
collect...
to
get
money
from
him
out
of
his
post-bankruptcy
earnings?
justice
white
well,
neither...
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
didn't
agree
with
that,
and
neither
did
the
bankruptcy
court.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
are
essentially
saying
that
the
federal
court
is
wrong
in
construing
kovacs's
obligation
under
state
law.
and
what
are
we
supposed
to
do--
justice
white
--do
you
think
the
bankruptcy
court
thought
that
kovacs
was
in...
what
you
claim
is
that
he
was
in
contempt
of
court
by
filing
the
petition
of
bankruptcy.
he
was
interfering
with
the
receiver
contrary
to
the
injunction.
justice
white
i
know.
but
the
federal
court
obviously
didn't
think
so.
justice
white
and
obviously,
under
state
law,
he
was
not
in
violation.
justice
white
well,
what
the
state
court...
but
i'm
sure
that
the
bankruptcy
court
must
have
considered
what
kovacs's
obligations
were
under
state
law.
justice
white
i
didn't
say
that.
justice
white
i
didn't
say
that.
do
you
think
they
thought
he
was
in
violation
of
the
injunction
to
file
the
bankruptcy
petition?
justice
white
suppose
the
district
court
had
addressed
it
and
said,
yes,
we
think
mr.
kovacs
is
in
violation
of
the
state
court
injunction.
what
would
they
have
done
then?
justice
white
exactly.
well,
then,
so
they
rejected
the
claim
that
he
was
in
violation
of
his
injunction.
justice
white
well,
they
rejected
it
nevertheless.
so
we're
supposed
to
disagree
with
them
on
what
his
obligations
were
under--
justice
white
ms.
oberly,
this
is
sort
of
like
ships
passing
in
the
night.
wouldn't
you
be
satisfied
if
the
state
of
ohio
was
free
to
go
into
a
local
court
and
say,
look,
your
obligation
under
the
injunction,
your
obligation
to
clean
up
is
not
a
claim,
and
the
federal
court
hasn't
said
it
is.
you're
under
an
order
to
clean
up,
and
you're
still
under
the
order.
now,
get
with
it
and
work
or
face
contempt.
now,
let's
assume
the
state
of
ohio
was
perfectly
free
to
do
that.
would
you
be
satisfied?
justice
white
well,
i
suggest
to
you
that
all
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
say
the
receiver
is
trying
to
get
money,
just
get
money
from
the
defendant,
and
not
trying
to
force
him
to
go
clean
up
himself.
they're
trying
to
get
money
from
him,
get
money
from
out
of
his
post-bankruptcy
earnings,
and
they
just
focused
on
that.
justice
white
you
may
answer,
of
course.
justice
white
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
talking
about
the
money,
not
about
the
obligation.
justice
white
not
about
the
obligation.
justice
white
if
all
it
was
doing
was
talking
about
the
money,
it
wouldn't...
they
weren't
saying
that
the
state
of
ohio
cannot
enforce
the
obligations
under
the
injunction.
justice
white
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
settlement
or
the
order
appointing
the
receiver
or
anything
else
that
released
kovacs
from
his
obligations
under
the
injunction.
justice
white
i
know
the
receiver
undertook
to
do
it.
justice
white
well,
that's
all
well
and
good,
but
i
don't
see
anything...
if
the
state
had...
if
the
receiver
quit
or
he
was
discharged
and
receivership
liquidated,
do
you
think
mr.
kovacs
would
have
any
remaining
obligations
under
the--
justice
white
--you
think
it
was
agreed
that
the
receiver
would
take
it
over.
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
that's
the
source
of
the
court
of
appeals'
observation
that
kovacs
cannot
personally
clean
up
the
waste
he
wrongfully
released
into
ohio
waters?
he
cannot
perform
the
affirmative
obligations
properly
imposed
upon
him
by
the
state
court?
justice
white
is
that
because
the
receiver
had
the
job,
or
what?
justice
white
well,
of
course,
kovacs
didn't
exactly
live
up
to
his
obligations
either.
justice
white
he
didn't
pay
over
the
$75,000.
justice
white
instead,
he
filed
for
bankruptcy.
justice
white
well,
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that,
that
the
obligations
are
not
completely
discharged
under
the
injunction?
what
would
you
say
then
about
this
ability
to
collect
money?
justice
white
ms.
oberly
reads
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
the
opinion
below
as
indicating
that
any
equitable
obligation
imposed
upon
kovacs
is
dischargable
and
has
been
discharged.
do
you
read
the
opinions
the
same
way?
do
you
read
the
bankruptcy
court's
ruling
and
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
as
effectively
disposing
of
and
ending
any
obligation
of
kovacs
under
the
injunction?
justice
white
so
you
say
that
a
court
has
addressed
it,
namely,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
white
well,
yes
or
no?
justice
white
and
they
settled
them
and
the
money
has
been
used
to
clean
up
the
surface.
justice
white
well,
why
should,
though,
the...
you
really
don't
think
that
these
kind
of
equitable
obligations
to
perform
are
just
normally
dischargable
in
bankruptcy,
do
you?
justice
white
i
suppose
claims
under
contracts
are
discharged,
even
though
they
could
be
specifically
enforced.
justice
white
what
changed
it
in
'80?
justice
white
the
receiver
is
in
possession.
justice
white
and
you've
made
the
settlement.
justice
white
so
if
the
day
after
the
injunction
was
entered
he
filed
for
bankruptcy,
and
the
question
came
up
of
dischargeability,
you
would
be
taking
a
different
position.
justice
white
well,
i'm
asking
you
whether
your
position
is
whether,
ordinarily,
equitable
obligations
like
this
are
dischargable?
justice
white
or
to
do
anything
to
clean
up
the
site
if
it
still
needs
cleaning
up.
justice
white
and
that's
the
result
of
the
opinions
below.
justice
white
didn't
the
bankruptcy
court
take
charge
of
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
receiver?
justice
white
so
kovacs's
property
was
never
committed
to
paying
his
bills?
justice
white
did
the
trustee...
was
there
a
trustee
appointed?
justice
white
did
he
abandon
the
property?
justice
white
so
anyway,
it
was
never
listed
as
a
part
of
the
assets
of
the
estate?
because
it's
not
an
asset.
justice
white
well,
nevertheless,
the
property
is
still
in
possession
of
the
receiver?
justice
white
never
was
a
turnover
ordered.
justice
white
so
the
receiver
is
still
in
possession.
justice
white
well,
the
trustee
has
been
discharged,
hasn't
he?
justice
white
he
wants
discharge,
then.
justice
white
what's
he
going
to
do
with
the
property?
justice
white
who
owns
chem-dyne?
justice
white
it
shouldn't
have
been
too
hard
to
figure
out
who
owned
the
property.
justice
white
what
happened?
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
inference
was
previously
given
that
the
property
would
revert,
and
i
just
couldn't
see...
understand
that.
that's
all.
