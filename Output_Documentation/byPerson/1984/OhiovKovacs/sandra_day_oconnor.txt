justice
o'connor
was
the
situation
exactly
the
same
at
the
time
you
appeared
before
the
sixth
circuit
as
it
is
today?
justice
o'connor
and
did
you
make
the
same
arguments,
or
what
was
the
status
then?
justice
o'connor
so
you
didn't
really
argue
before
the
sixth
circuit
the
ground
water
contamination
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
i
have
one,
actually.
now,
would
the
state
be
prohibited
by
the
judgment
and
orders
of
the
sixth
circuit
from
proceeding
against
kovacs
for
contempt
for
any
prior
failure
to
comply
with
the
injunction?
justice
o'connor
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
we
don't
know
that.
at
least
the
sixth
circuit
in
its
opinion
said
that
if
ohio
had
elected
to
have
a
money
penalty
assessed
against
kovacs
for
the
environmental
damage
he
caused,
we
would
have
faced
a
different
question,
and
that
would
not
have
been
subject
to
the
automatic
stay.
justice
o'connor
ms.
oberly,
i
also
would
like
to
ask
one
more
thing.
do
you
think
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
how
the
ohio
courts
would
view
the
obligation
of
kovacs
under
the
injunction,
and
the
extent
to
which
performance
has
been
given
or
not?
justice
o'connor
is
there
something
in
the
bankruptcy
code
presently
that
tells
the
bankruptcy
judge
what
the
judge
should
do
in
those
circumstances?
justice
o'connor
right.
and
it
isn't
mandatory
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
abstain.
justice
o'connor
but
there's
nothing
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
either
under
the
new
amendments
or
otherwise,
that
would
require
sending
it
back
to
the
state
court.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
might,
of
course,
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
other
people
who
might
otherwise
think
that
they
had
to
do
to
get
out
from
under
one
of
these
state
court
injunctions
is
to
file
for
bankruptcy,
and
then
it's
over.
and
so
if
there
is
a
lingering
effect,
even
if
mr.
kovacs
can't
begin
to
pay
the
real
cost
of
this
thing,
if
he
has
to
pay
something,
whatever
the
court
determines
is
appropriate
and
that
can
be
paid,
maybe
that
is
a
deterrent.
that's
the
question.
justice
o'connor
--no,
not
the
bankruptcy
law.
we're
talking,
aren't
we,
about
the
continuing
effect
of
the
state
court
injunction
for
the
removal
or
prevention
of
pollution.
we're
not
really
talking
about
the
bankruptcy.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
we're
really
talking
about
whether
the
bankruptcy,
the
automatic
stay
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
law
extends
to
cover
a
state
pollution
injunction
in
some
of
its
permanent
features
and
aspects.
i
think
the
state
injunction,
for
instance,
said
that
the
defendant...
that
mr.
kovacs
and
his
employees
were
permanently
enjoined
from
causing
anything
injurious
to
the
health
and
property
of
individuals
in
the
public.
and
that
would
be
a
theoretically
permanent
continuing
type
obligation.
