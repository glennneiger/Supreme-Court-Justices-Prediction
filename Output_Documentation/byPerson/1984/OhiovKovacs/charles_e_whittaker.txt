justice
whittaker
well,
is
that
a
question
that
ought
to
be
addressed
by
some
court,
somewhere
along
the
line,
the
extent
to
which
under
the
state
court
injunction,
there
is
a
continuing
obligation
of
some
kind?
and
it
just
looks,
at
least
from
the
opinions
below,
that
nobody
addressed
that
question.
no
court
yet
has
really
looked
at
that.
now,
where
should
that
be
addressed,
and
who
has
the
jurisdiction
to
do
it?
justice
whittaker
--well,
shouldn't
part
of
the
inquiry
encompass,
at
least
at
the
first
level
by
the
bankruptcy
judge,
the
extent
to
which
ohio
would
say
there
is
a
continuing
obligation
remaining
under
the
injunction?
is
that
an
appropriate
inquiry
to
be
made?
