justice
rehnquist
mr.
muchnicki,
when
you're
talking
here,
you're
talking
basically
about
the
dischargability
of
a
claim
in
bankruptcy,
aren't
you?
justice
rehnquist
and
therefore
can
be
discharged.
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly,
the
first
place
you'd
look
for
that
is
the
bankruptcy
court.
i
mean
the
thing
comes
up
under
the
bankruptcy
statute,
not
under
any
other
statute.
justice
rehnquist
but
if
you
say
it's
not
a
claim,
then
presumably
ohio
is
not
entitled
to
share
with
other
general
creditors
in
the
bankrupt's
estate.
wouldn't
that
be
the
case?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
really
what
that
sort
of
result
here?
justice
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
suggest
that
ohio
is
not
prevented
by
anything
except
lack
of
money
from
cleaning
up
this
site,
and
what
you're
really
concerned
about
here
is
money.
justice
rehnquist
but
when
you
say
you
want
performance
from
him,
you
don't
actually
want
this
particular
individual
to
come
down
to
the
site
with
a
pick
and
shovel
and
start
digging
himself?
justice
rehnquist
you
want
him
to
put
up
the
money
required
by
the
injunctive
decree
so
that
some
contractor
can
be
hired
to
do
it?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
we're
falling
into
the
same
error
that
the
court
of
appeals
fell
into?
justice
rehnquist
but
your
opponent
claims
that
kovacs's
obligations
under
the
injunction
haven't
been
fully
performed.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
rehnquist
well,
about
a
child
support
decree?
i
mean
certainly--
justice
rehnquist
--but
i
was
addressing
myself
to
your
insistence
that
because
he
has
no
money
and
is
in
new
jersey...
has
moved
to
new
jersey
from
ohio...
therefore,
who
in
his
right
mind
would
suggest
he
ought
to
perform
his
duties
under
the
ohio
injunction?
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
appealing
argument.
justice
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
if
he
were
cited
for
contempt,
the
ohio
court
in
butler
county
would
probably
say
no,
you're
not
in
contempt
because
it's
impossible
for
you
to
perform?
justice
rehnquist
and
it's
not
part
of
the
bankrupt
estate?
