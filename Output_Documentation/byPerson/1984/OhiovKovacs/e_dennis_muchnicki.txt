mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
matter
is
before
the
court
pursuant
to
a
petition
filed
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
ohio,
seeking
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
people
of
ohio
seek
reversal
of
the
determination
that
a
bankruptcy
court
may
discharge
the
duty
of
a
debtor
to
comply
with
the
state
court
injunction
to
abate
a
public
health
hazard
by
cleaning
up
a
hazardous
waste...
a
toxic
waste
facility.
in
this
argument,
ohio
wishes
to
make
three
basic
points.
first,
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
the
decision
below
treats
the
goals
of
the
bankruptcy
system
as
absolute
values
which
transcend
virtually
every
other
matter
of
public
policy,
including
the
protection
of
public
health
and
safety.
secondly,
as
to
the
factual
context
of
this
case,
ohio
is
not
before
this
court
seeking
compensation
for
past
harm
or
expenses,
but
rather
we
are
attempting
to
prevent
future
harm
by
obtaining
compliance
with
an
injunction
to
abate
an
ongoing
nuisance
and
health
hazard.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
no,
it
has
not,
your
honor.
the
drums...
the
drums
that
were...
the
materials
that
were
in
the
drums
or
that
remain
in
the
drums
have
been
removed,
but
the
most
serious
problem
that
still
exists
is
the
pollution
of
the
ground
water
which
is
used
by
the
city
of
hamilton
for
its
water
supply.
and
right
now,
as
a
result
of
the
past
practices
on
that
site,
the
soils
of
the
site
are
so
thoroughly
saturated
with
toxic
wastes
that
they
are
now
an
ongoing
source
of
pollution,
that
every
day
more
pollution
is
leaching
into
the
ground
water
and
you
have
a
continuing
violation.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
receiver
is
still
in
possession.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
receiver
has
equitable
possession.
kovacs
still
has
partial
title
to
the...
legal
title
to
the
site.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes.
although
right
now,
actually,
us
fpa
is
exercising
authority
jointly
with
him.
but
the
receiver,
under
the
state
court
order,
has
equitable
possession
of
the
site.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
you
mean
now?
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
no,
he
could
not.
what
he--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--they
created...
they
put
the
receiver
in
equitable
possession
of
the
property.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
waste
that
remained--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--what
the
receiver
wants
and
what
the
people
of
the
state
of
ohio
want
is
completion
of
that
cleanup.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
they
may--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--what
he
wants
is
the
performance
of
certain
acts
which
probably
wouldn't
require
the
expenditure
of
money.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
well,
they
want
the
acts
of
removal
of
the
soils
and--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--that's
true;
he
cannot.
but
he--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--he
may
be
able,
with
the
receiver's
agreement...
and
the
receiver
would
be
happy
to
have
him
come
in
and
do
those
things...
it's
not
where
the
receivers
will
not
let
him
on
the
site.
the
receiver
would
be
more
than
happy
to
have
him
come
back.
in
fact,
that's
what
we're
trying
to
obtain.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
receiver...
he
would
not
be
paying
money
to
the
receiver.
i
think
he
would
probably
be
paying
the
money
to
a
contractor
to
do
the
work.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
and
that,
in
and
of
itself...
that
is
the
situation.
but
that
is
not
a
factor
which
is
dispositive
of
the
issue,
because
as
to
the
third
point
which
we
wish
to
make
in
this
case...
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
word
"claim",
ohio's
position
is
based
on
both
the
language
of
the
code
and
the
legislative
history,
whereas
the
decision
below
finds
support
neither
in
the
code
language
nor
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes.
well,
the
receiver
joined
in
the
original
motion
to
have
the
state
court
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
the
extent
of
mr.
kovacs's
further
obligations.
that
was
the
hearing
which
the
bankruptcy
court
held...
stayed.
so
the
receiver
was
trying
to
bring
mr.
kovacs
before
the
court
so
that
he
could
get
further
instructions
from
the
court,
both
through
the
receiver
and
mr.
kovacs.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
receiver
effectively
is
the
alter
ego
of
mr.
kovacs.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
that
is
by
force
of
the
order
appointing
him.
he
is
specifically
appointed
with
the
directive
to
implement
the
cleanup
contained
in
the
injunctions.
and
the
order
appointing
receiver,
then,
had
an
injunction,
a
continuing
injunction
against
mr.
kovacs
to
cooperate
with
the
receiver.
the
net
effect
is
the
receiver
would
supervise
it.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes,
it
is.
well,
there
is
the
original
injunction
and
then
the
order
appointing
the
receiver--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--repeats
the
original
injunction
and
then
has
also
another
injunction
in
it,
stating
mr.
kovacs
is
to
continue
to
cooperate
with
the
receiver
in
implementing
the
injunction.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
receiver
and
mr.
kovacs
have
the
responsibility.
there
is
nothing
in
the
order
appointing
receiver
which
says
mr.
kovacs
no
longer
has
that
responsibility.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
it
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes.
there's...
anyhow,
the
order...
in
other
words,
it
adds
the
receiver
to
the
cleanup
effort.
it
does
not
subtract
mr.
kovacs.
and
that's
a
critical
factor.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
record
indicates
that
when
ohio...
the
state
and
the
receiver
wish
to
bring
mr.
kovacs
into
the
state
court.
mr.
kovacs
asked
the
bankruptcy
court
to
prevent
that
proceeding
from
going
forward.
and
we
certainly--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--the
record
would
show
that
he
has
not
cooperated
in
coming
back
to
the
state
court
the
way
the
receiver
wanted
him
to,
to
further
define
his
responsibilities.
so
we
would
say
yes,
the
record
indicates
that
he
has
not
been
cooperative.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
correct.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
well,
i
think
it
does,
because
as
you
have
just
suggested
yourself--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--correct.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
well,
it
has
basically
stopped
the
cleanup
effort.
and
as
of
now,
there
has
been
no
further...
there
has
been
no
cooperation
from
mr.
kovacs
to
the
receiver
as
of
this
time.
now,
turning
to
the
first
issue
which
we
wish
to
put
before
the
court,
and
that
is
the
basic
policy
matter
that's
presented
by
this
case...
now,
in
reviewing
the
decisions
below,
we
see
that
in
all
of
the
decisions,
there
is
not
one
reference
or
one
expression
of
concern
for
this
interest
of
the
state
to
clean
up
the
site
and
protect
the
public.
the
sole--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--no.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
status
then
was
the
drums
had
not
removed
from
the
surface
either.
other
than
that...
and
i
don't
think
we
were
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
ground
water
contamination.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
we
did...
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
we
argued,
first
of
all,
that
the
drums
were
there
and
they,
in
themselves,
were
a
hazard.
and
we
were
pretty
sure,
because
of
the
past
operational
practices
and
stuff
leaching
into
the
soil,
that
there
was
ground
water
contamination,
and
we
did
point
out
the
soil
was
contaminated
and
had
to
be
removed.
yet,
in
the
opinion
below,
or
in
all
three
of
the
opinions,
there
is
no
discussion
of
that
interest.
the
sole
focal
point
is
on
the
interest
of
the
debtor.
it
treats
bankruptcy,
basically,
as
an
absolute
right
where
the
bankruptcy
judge
basically
determines
the
relevance
of
the
rest
of
the
united
states
code,
or
in
the
laws
of
the
states.
it's
as
though
bankruptcy
is
always
the
supreme
policy.
now,
the
third
circuit,
in
the
recent
penn
terra
case,
recognizes
that
on
its
face,
the
bankruptcy
code
recognizes
that
there
are
other
policies
which
at
times
are
to
prevail...
one
of
which,
specifically
referenced,
is
protection
of
the
environment.
in
the
automatic
statutory
stay
provisions,
congress
said
we
did
not
want
to
interfere
with
the
states
and
their
police
power
enforcement
activities;
in
the
removal
provisions,
so
that
you
cannot
remove
an
enforcement
action
to
the
bankruptcy
court;
in
28
usc
959b,
there
is
a
specific
provision
requiring
trustees
to
operate
in
compliance
with
state
law.
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
105
dealing
with
discretionary
stays,
there
is
specific
reference
to
the
fact
that
any
discretionary
injunction
must
protect
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
in
its
law
enforcement.
thus,
in
penn
terra,
they
recognized
that
the
bankruptcy
code
is
one
title
of
the
united
states
code;
it
does
not
overrule
everything
else.
similarly,
the
court
below
did
not
recognize
the
repeated
holdings
of
this
court
which
have
held
that
there
will
not
be
a
preemptive
effect
created...
preemption
of
state
regulation,
absent
clear
and
expressed
congressional
language.
and
in
the
bankrupt--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--we
are
talking
about
whether
the
duty
to
comply
with
the
injunction
is
a
claim
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
correct.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
determining
whether
the...
after
you
look
at
the
code
and
you
see
the
definition
of
claim,
one
then
has
to
say
is
this
obligation
a
claim.
and
what
is
the
effect
of
that
interpretation,
particularly
when
there's
no
indication
anywhere
in
either
the
language
of
the
code
or
in
the
legislative
history
that
injunctions
to
abate
nuisances
were
to
be
construed
as
a
claim.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes.
if
something
is
not
a
claim,
you
would
not
share
in
the
estate.
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes,
we
do,
to
a
certain...
here's...
yes,
we
do,
because
it
may
wind
up
that,
in
fact,
we
do
wind
up
sharing
in
the
estate,
in
that
the
estate
has
to
be
used
to
comply
with
the
law.
we
are
not
a...
we
do
not
have
a
claim
that
we
fit
within
the
priorities.
now,
for
past
expenditures...
for
example,
if
we
were
able
to
do
the
cleanup
and
had
a
bill,
that
bill
might
be
a
claim.
but
in
terms
of
having
ongoing
problems,
that
is
not
a
claim.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
it
is
unclear
on
that.
i
think
ohio
law
provides
for
a
lien
on
the
property,
that's
all.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
a
lien
on
the
property.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
right.
now--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--yes,
and
what
you
get
is
a
lien
on
the
property.
now--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--i
think
it
is
not
a
question
of
authority,
your
honor;
it
is
a
question
of
ability.
we
don't
have
the
ability
to
do
it.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
if
you
look
at
the
situation,
i'll
give
you
an
example
of
what
ohio
is
facing
with
leached
toxic
waste
sites.
we
have
28
sites
right
now
on
the
national
priority
list.
we
have
23
more
that
are
being
evaluated
for
placement
on
it.
we
have
800
more
that
we
are
still
investigating.
we
don't
have
the
money
to
clean
those
all
up.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
well,
yes,
money
will
be
required
to
take
up
the
site.
but
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
how
congress
treated
this,
and
what
did
congress
decide
in
terms
of
the
definition
of
claim?
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
that
language,
the
claim
is
to
find,
in
terms
of
equitable
remedies,
and
whether
we
can
compel
the
debtor
to
perform
the
injunction,
the
definition
of
claim
for
equitable
remedy
says
"an
equitable
remedy
for
breach
of
performance,
if
the
breach
gives
rise
from
an
alternative
right
to
payment.
"
now,
to
begin
with,
the
breach
of
performance
is
a
contractual
phrase.
it
does
not
refer
to
violations
of
law.
indeed,
when
you
think
about
the
difference
between
a
contractual
situation
where
two
people
voluntarily
agree
to
do
something,
in
this
situation
where
the
public
has
not
agreed
to
have
mr.
kovacs
impose
his
obligations
on
the
people
of
hamilton,
you
can
see
it's
a
whole
different
thing
than
the
breach
of
performance
we
talk
about
in
contracts.
similarly,
here
we
do
not
have
an
alternative
right
to
payment.
any
payment
would
be
made
to
effectuate
the
injunction.
in
fact,
the
court
below
even
recognizes,
and
mr.
kovacs
recognizes
in
his
brief,
that
any
payment
made
here
is
not
an
alternative
to
performance;
it
is
to
facilitate
the
performance.
so
we
have
a
completely
different
situation
than
the
contract,
which
is
the
example
in
the
legislative
history.
and
when
you
search
through
the
legislative
history
or
the
language
of
the
code,
there
is
nothing
which
suggests
that
an
injunction
to
evade
an
ongoing
threat
is
dischargable
in
bankruptcy.
indeed,
the
language
is
clearly
to
the
contrary,
as
is
the
legislative
history.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes,
and
that's
not
at
issue
there.
we
agree
that's
a
claim.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
with
regard
to
that
75--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--what
we're
trying
to
do
is
get
him
to
perform
the
acts
required
by
the
injunction
which
are
not
at
claim.
the
monetary
obligation
to
pay
the
fine
fits
under
the
right
to
payment
part
of
the
definition
of
claim.
we're
talking
about
the
equitable
obligation.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
that's
true.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
that's
true.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
that
is
not
presented
here.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
no,
that's
true.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
i'd
say
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
so
does
mr.
kovacs.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
but
the
receiver
has
no
funds.
he
has
nothing
also.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
there
is
nothing
left
in
the
estate.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
not
in
the
estate
that
is
run
by
the
receiver.
there
was
some
in
the
bankruptcy
estate.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes.
that's
included.
the
injunction--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--the
injunction
to
cooperate
with
the
receiver
which
i
believe
is
paragraph--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--it's
on
page
ja-15.
and
the
middle
injunction:
to
fully
cooperate
with
the
receiver
in
the
performance
of
such
duties,
and
referring
to
the
duty
to
implement
the
injunction.
i'd
like,
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--we
believe
that
that
would
be
the
case.
certainly,
to
give
you--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
we
encountered
previously
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
first
time
we
appeared...
when
we
filed
the
mere
motion
requesting...
for
the
hearing
to
determine
what
his
current
status
was,
and
then
the
debtor
moved
for
imposition
of
the
stay,
the
bankruptcy
judge...
his
first
question
was
why
he
should
not
hold
me
in
contempt.
and
i
didn't
feel
i
had
done
anything
other
than
ask
for
a
hearing,
an
informational
hearing.
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
construed
this
to
be
very
broad,
and
therefore
i
tend
to
think
that
if
i
were
to
file
a
motion
to
hold
mr.
kovacs
in
contempt,
that
would
be
viewed
as
an
attempt
to
compel
him
to
pay
and
the
bankruptcy
court
would
find
me--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--the
sixth
circuit
did
say
that.
but
even
if
we
go
into
that
penalty,
it
does
not
accomplish
the
cleanup
which
is
necessary
to
protect
the
public,
and
i
think
that
is
our
primary
concern
here.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
two
fact
statements.
first
of
all...
and
if
the
court
would
wish,
i
will
send
them
a
copy.
apparently
the
receiver
intends
to
file
a
motion
to
terminate
the
receivership
next
week.
he
no
longer
has
the
money
to
pay
for
his
bond.
if
you
wish,
i
will
supply
a
copy
of
that
to
the
court.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
he
simply
has
nothing
left,
and
he
can't
even
pay
for
his
receivership
bond
anymore.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
yes.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
property
will
revert,
i
would
assume,
to
mr.
kovacs
because
here
is
the--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--well,
here
is
the
status
of
the
property.
the
property...
the
chem-dyne
is
owned
by
hierco
realty,
which
is
a
partnership;
it
was
part
of
the
bankruptcy.
the
partners
of
hierco
realty
are
mr.
kovacs
and
the
chem-dyne
corporation
which
is
not
in
the
bankruptcy.
the
net
effect
is
that
neither
the
bankruptcy
trustee
nor
the
state
court
receiver
could
figure
out
who
owned
the
property
or
who
had
it,
but
the
bankruptcy
trustee
said
he
didn't
want
it.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
the
chem-dyne
corporation,
all
the
stock
is
owned
by
kovacs,
but
the
stock--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--i
think
on
that
suggestion,
that
would
certainly
show
where
it
is.
also,
as
to
whether
there
was
a
turnover
action,
in
fact,
the
bankruptcy
trustee
did
file
a
turnover
action--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--against
the
receiver,
and
the
receiver
had
to
turn
over
the
most
important
thing,
being
like
the
tank
trucks
and
the
pumps
and
the
things
that
he
was
using
to
do
the
cleanup.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
no,
that
was
not
in
the
record.
that
happened
after.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
well,
i
was
simply
responding
to
the
factual
question
that
was
raised.
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
well,
it
would
be
my
understanding,
what
the
receiver
apparently
intends
to
do
is
to
file
a
motion
to
dissolve
it,
and
at
that
point
the
property
will
go
back
to
mr.
kovacs.
but
i
will
provide
the
court
with
whatever--
mr.
e.
dennis
muchnicki
--thank
you,
your
honor.
we'll
attempt
to
do
that.
