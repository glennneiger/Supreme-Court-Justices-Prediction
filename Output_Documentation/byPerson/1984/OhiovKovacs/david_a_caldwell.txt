mr.
david
a.
caldwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
in
analyzing
this
obligation,
there
is
really
only
one
point
in
time
which
is
relevant,
and
that
is
on
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
september
2,
1980.
it
matters
little
what
the
nature
of
the
obligation
was
a
year
before
that.
the
only
critical
thing
is
what
obligation
did
the
bankrupt
owe
on
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
you
recall
by
that
time,
the
chem-dyne
site
had
been
in
the
possession
of
a
receiver
for
nearly
eight
months,
and
also
in
possession
of
all
of
mr.
kovacs's
then
existing
assets.
now,
this
receivership
was
imposed
in
order
to
enforce
the
agreed
judgment
entry
of
july
1979.
whether
we
call
that
judgment
entry
injunction
or
whatever,
it's
clear
that
it
came
about
as
a
result
of
an
agreed
settlement
of
a
disputed
lawsuit.
the
state
of
ohio,
with
all
of
its
expertise
in
july
of
1979,
made
a
value
judgment
that
they
should
accept
the
agreement
of
bill
kovacs
to
pay
for
some
dead
fish
and
to
remove
the
waste
stored
on
the
surface
of
the
site,
period.
and
the
entry
recites
that
that
is
a
compromise,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
and
the
attorney
general
admits
that
that
agreement
was
made
in
full
satisfaction
of
the
obligations
of
kovacs.
now,
admittedly,
the
obligation
to
clean
up
the
surface
was
not
performed
by
mr.
kovacs.
that's
why
the
receiver
was
appointed.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
no,
except
that
it
replaced--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--the
receiver
is
ordered
to
do
it,
and
it's
a
little
hard
to
visualize
these
two
arm-wrestling
over
who
has
control
of
the
site.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
thing
the
receiver
did
was
fire
mr.
kovacs
as
president
of
chem-dyne.
he
was
out
of
a
job.
now,
it's
a
little
difficult
as
a
practical
attorney
to
imagine
that
mr.
kovacs,
out
of
possession--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--no,
i
do
not,
because
i
think
the--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--i
think
that's
the
natural
consequence
of
it,
because
the
receiver
took
all
of
his
assets,
both
personal
and
corporate,
and
the
court
then
ordered
the
receiver
to
apply
those
assets
to
the
cleanup.
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--well,
i
think
that's--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--i
think
it's
a
necessary
characteristic,
if
you're
talking
about
an
obligation
here
that
involves
the
expenditure
of
millions
of
dollars,
you're
talking
about
a
human
being
who
has
a
family
to
support,
and
you
take
everything
he
owns;
can
you
imagine
any
state
court,
after
the
money
is
all
gone,
holding
him
in
contempt
because
he
doesn't
quit
his
job
in
new
jersey
and
come
back
here
and
clean
up
that
site?
i
think
that
would
be
an
aberration
in
equity
jurisprudence.
i
think,
realistically--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--well,
there's
no
question.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
no
question
about
it,
and
no
question
that
that's
an
obligation--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--he
failed
to
cooperate
by
filing
bankruptcy.
he
availed
himself
with
the
fresh
start
that
is
the
very
spirit
of
the
bankruptcy
laws.
the
state
has
ignored
the
fact
that
throughout
this...
and
i've
never
seen
an
answer
to
it...
that
what
the
state
settled
for
here
was
the
surface
cleanup.
now,
they
obviously
found
later
that
some
of
these
chemicals
that
seeped
into
soil
and
so
on,
obviously
what
they
found
out
was
that
maybe
they
didn't
make
such
a
good
deal.
well,
that's
all
well
and
good,
but
i
don't
think
the
state
of
ohio
can
now
be
heard
to
say
you,
kovacs,
have
to
clean
up
the
soil
underneath.
and
the
real
significance
of
this
is
that
everything
kovacs
was
obligated
to
do
has
now
been
performed,
and
the
cost
of
that
is
liquidated,
and
there's
no
question
that
that
obligation,
that
bill,
is
dischargable
in
bankruptcy.
the
only
difference,
in
effect,
between
now
and
back
in
september
of
1980
is
that
now
the
obligation
is
liquidated.
we
have
a
dollar
figure.
the
money
has
been
spent.
and
we
know
that
claims
in
bankruptcy
are
dischargable,
not
based
on
the
fact
of
whether
they're
liquidated
or
unliquidated.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i
certainly
do.
kovacs
didn't
settle
for
digging
up
all
the
soil
on
the
site.
he
settled
for
moving
850,000
gallons
of
liquids
and
4,000
barrels,
period.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i
think,
even
if
you
disagree,
that
the
whole
obligation
of
kovacs
is
now
performed,
you're
still
looking
at
a
money
obligation.
all
of
it
may
not
be
liquidated
as
of
today,
but
it's
still
something
that
somebody
else
is
going
to
do.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
well,
since
the
adoption
of
the
1978
code,
the
determination
of
the
dischargability
of
bankruptcy
claims
has
been
pretty
well
lodged
in
the
federal
court.
now,
back
when
i
started
practice,
you
could
run
through
bankruptcy
and
then
later
sue
on
it
in
state
court,
and
the
state
court
would
determine
whether
that
claim
was
discharged.
well,
that
practice--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i
don't
think
that's
a
matter
of
state
law,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
oh,
yes;
i
think
so,
because--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--your
honor,
we're
looking--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--pardon?
yes.
they're
looking
at
the
same
facts
everyone
else
is
looking
at,
that
the
thing
that
brought
this
matter
into
court
was
a
motion
of
the
state,
seeking
to
garnish
my
client's
wages.
now,
he
describes
it
in
all
different
evasive
things,
but
we
call
that
a
judgment
debtor
exam
in
ohio.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i'm
sure
that's
true.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i'd
have
to
defer
to
my
colleague,
but
that's
a
typical
state
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
no.
this
site
began,
really,
in
the
infancy,
just
on
the
eve
of
real
environmental
awareness,
and
ohio...
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
behind
anywhere
else...
but
there
was
no
licensing
required
at
that
time.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i
think
not.
the
cost
of
taking
it
down
may
well
be
an
obligation
to
the
state.
but
you
don't
acquire
the
future
right
to
maintain
your
bridge
or
the
future
right
to
conduct
an
activity
to
pollute
it,
certainly.
that's
not
discharged.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i
think
that
obligation
might
well
be
discharged.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
no,
your
honor.
none
of
us
have
any
cases
on
that
portion.
but
i
have
not
seen,
and
we
researched
this,
of
course,
at
the
lower
level,
any
cases
that
hold
a
person
may
be
held
in
contempt
where
the
performance
is
financially
impossible.
i
mean
you
reach
the
point
where
you're
talking
about
involuntary
servitude.
if
there
is
an
equitable
obligation
today,
would
anybody
require
the
man
to
quit
his
job,
come
back
to
ohio
where
he
has
no
employment,
to
do
something
that
costs
millions
of
dollars
when
he
has
not
the
money
to
do
it?
i
can't
believe
that.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
child
support,
there's
a
clear
example
of
the
differentiation
here.
that,
of
course,
is
specifically
non-dischargable.
it's
an
obligation
that's
capable,
presumably
capable
of
being
met
out
of
weekly
wages,
and
congress
determined...
congress
determined
that
obligation
is
not
dischargable.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
well,
the
appeal...
maybe
i
didn't
state
it
properly...
is
the
possibility
of
doing.
we're
talking
about
something
that's
infinitely
impossible.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
that's
right,
just
as
in
child
support
cases,
you
can't
find
in
contempt
the
quadraplegic
who
can't
earn
any
money
to
pay
child
support.
when
we're
talking
about
a
multimillion
dollar
obligation
against
a
wage
earner,
you
have
the
same
result.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i
think
it
would.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i
think
it
is.
now,
the
state
and
the
federal
government
have
indicated
many
times,
over
and
over
in
this
case,
that
the
rulings
of
the
court
below
are
seriously
hampering
the
enforcement
efforts
of
the
state
and
federal
government.
and
i
say
that
that
simply
is
not
so.
you
look
at
this
case;
they
succeeded
in
putting
mr.
kovacs
out
of
business
in
very
short
order,
taking
all
of
his
assets
and
applying
them
to
the
cleanup.
now,
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
reversal?
would
it
really
accomplish
what
the
state
claims
they're
seeking,
if
they
could
garnish
mr.
kovacs's
wages
once
a
month?
would
that
really--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--forever.
would
that
ever
really
make
a
dent
in
the
environmental
problem
in
the
country?
secondly--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i'm
sorry.
your
honor,
the
word
"deterrent"
to
me,
as
a
lawyer,
always
brings
about
the
criminal
laws,
not
the
bankruptcy
laws.
and
we
have
criminal
laws--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--i
know
what
you're
saying,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it's
always
been
the
philosophy
that
the
bankruptcy
laws
are
not
to
be
used
as
a
deterrent.
any
deterrent
effect
of
any
of
these
laws
is
to
be
brought
about
by
prosecuting
criminals.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
that
is
to
refrain
from
future
acts,
certainly.
we're
not
talking
about
the
automatic
stay
today.
we're
talking
about
dischargeability.
but
there's
no
question
you
can't
buy
the
right
to
continue
to
pollute.
but
at
any
rate,
the
state
really
cannot
demonstrate
any
real
hindrance
to
the
enforcement
efforts
through
the
decisions
of
the
lower
court.
in
fact,
as
one
of
your
honors
pointed
out,
a
reversal
would
prevent
them
from
participating
in
any
future
corporate
liquidation.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
well,
that
isn't
really--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--i
know.
that
isn't
really
true.
the
whole
toxic
waste
situation
cannot
be
belittled
certainly.
it
was
a
product
of
american
industry.
mr.
kovacs
didn't
cause
the
toxic
waste
problem.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
through
the
suits
against
the
generators,
the
courts
have
recognized
that
industry
as
a
whole
should
bear
the
cost,
and
they
are
as
a
practical
matter
in
this
case.
suits
against
the
companies
generating
this
waste
have
already
been
settled,
which
paid
for
the
cleanup
of
the
surface.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
right.
they
settled
with
some
companies.
some
of
them
didn't
settle.
presumably,
they'll
get
the
cost
of
the
rest
of
it
from
these
companies.
now
that
cost
is,
of
course,
passed
on.
but
i
don't
think
a
realistic
answer
to
the
problem
is
denying
an
individual
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy,
because
it
isn't
going
to
bring
about
the
result
that
the
state
desires,
the
needs
in
this
matter.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
well,
if
you're
talking
about
an
affirmative
obligation
to
do
something--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--if
kovacs
had
filed
bankruptcy
in
september
1979
instead
of
'80,
we
might
have
a
different
question.
but
that
isn't
the
fact
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
in
'80,
he's
already
out
of
possession
and
there's
no--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--right.
right.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
that's
right.
the
cost
of
it
is
ascertained.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
been
paid
by
someone
else.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
depending
on
which
side
it
was
on.
[laughter]
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
you
can
certainly
make
an
argument
that
they
are
dischargable.
the
legislative
history
which
has
been
quoted
in
here,
more
in
the
state's
brief
and
ours,
tends
to
indicate
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
the
dischargability
of
an
obligation
relating
to
future
conduct.
don't
do
this
in
the
future.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
no
question.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
well,
you
may
be
correct,
your
honor.
i
know
that
in
my
experience
it's
much
easier
to
avoid
paying
a
$10
million
judgment
than
it
is
a
$1,000
judgment.
and
my
client
is
not
an
irresponsible
person.
if
he
were,
he
would
have
moved
to
australia
by
now.
he
is
going
on...
he
has
a
background
in
chemical
engineering.
he
has
a
right
to
a
discharge,
and
he's
interested
in
protecting
his
right.
to
give
the
state
of
ohio
the
right
to
destroy
his
life
by
garnishing
his
wages
every
month
or
so
would
deny
him
that
right.
that's
really
what
we're
talking
about.
it's
academic
in
the
sense
that
a
reversal
will
never
give
the
state
what
it
wants
unless
the
attorney
general
is
somebody
out
of
charles
dickens.
it
could
only
be
a
punitive
thing;
it
couldn't
achieve
anything
of
worthwhile
value
in
cleaning
up
the
environment.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
depends
on--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
then
this
obligation
will
fall
under
the
discharge;
yes.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i
don't
think
if
he
goes
back
to
hamilton,
ohio
and
starts
dumping
anything
into
the
river
again--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--i
think
he
will
have
no
further
monetary
obligation
to
pay
money
into
the--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--i
think
that's
right.
now,
there
is
one--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--yes.
one
point
that
was
raised
in
the
state's
reply
brief
that
we,
of
course,
couldn't
address,
and
that
was
the
suggestion
that
if
this
case
is
affirmed,
this
property
will
revert
to
mr.
kovacs's
possession,
and
he'll
be
free
to
go
back
in
business.
well,
that,
of
course,
is
absurd.
the
state
court
receiver
has
the
power
of
sale,
and
presumably
he
will
sell
the
property
to
satisfy
whatever
remaining
financial
obligations
there
are.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
well,
you
have
to
remember,
you
have
a
piece
of
property,
the
toxic
nature
of
it
being
notorious
all
over
the
midwest;
do
you
really
think
that
any--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--a
trustee
was
appointed.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
not
formally,
but
he
wouldn't
touch
it
with
a
ten-foot
pole.
[laughter]
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
it's
either--
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
--pardon?
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
well,
i
guess
anything
is
an
asset.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
oh,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
no.
the
bankruptcy
trustee
didn't
want
that
property.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
right.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
well,
the
bankruptcy
court
has
not
dealt
with
it,
and
as
i
say,
no
trustee
wants
to
grab
it
until
it's
cleaned
up.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
you
mean
to
share
in
the
bankruptcy
estate?
mr.
david
a.
caldwell
i
don't
think
there
is
that
estate,
simply
because
the
state
court
receiver
had
spent
everything
that
there
was
in
the
way
of
assets
by
the
time
he
went
bankrupt.
