chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
ohio
v.
kovacs.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
counsel.
chief
justice
burger
--you
stated
that
the
receiver
would
be
very
happy
to
help
him
do
all
these
things.
where
do
we
find
that
out?
does
the
record
show
willingness
to
cooperate?
chief
justice
burger
under
law,
could
the
state
move
in
and
undertake
this
and
then,
a
little
bit
late,
seek
to
get
reimbursement?
chief
justice
burger
for
what?
chief
justice
burger
just
a
lien,
not
some
positive
action?
chief
justice
burger
normally,
in
most
states,
if
there
is
a
fire,
for
example,
and
a
building
is
imposing
a
hazard
after
the
fire
is
over,
falling
debris
and
collapsing
walls,
there
is
inherent
authority
in
the
local
governments
to
go
in
and
take
care
of
it
if
the
owners
don't.
now,
isn't
there
something
like
that
in
ohio?
chief
justice
burger
well,
a
lien
isn't
going
to
take
care
of
the
toxic
wastes.
are
you
saying
ohio
has
no
authority
to
go
in
and
do
this?
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
can
hire
people
to
do
it.
the
city
council
doesn't
go
out
and
tear
the
walls
down
of
a
partially
burned
building,
but
they
hire
somebody
to
do
it
if
the
owner
doesn't
do
it.
chief
justice
burger
the
receiver
has
certain
inherent
authority
to
credit
of
the
estate,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
burger
nothing
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
oberly.
chief
justice
burger
before
these
waste
dumps
were
opened
and
operated,
did
they
secure
a
license
of
some
kind
from
the
state?
chief
justice
burger
is
the
ohio
state
law
something
since
this
event
arose?
chief
justice
burger
but
if
ultimately
there
isn't
any
money
anywhere
in
the
private
source
to
do
this,
where
lies
the
obligation?
chief
justice
burger
because
the
state
allowed
them
to
do
it,
either
by
license
or
by
leave.
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
say
they
license
them
now,
though?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
say
this
is
a
debt,
or
is
it
something
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
caldwell,
we'll
count
on
you
to
clear
these
matters
up
for
us
now.
chief
justice
burger
the
assistant
attorney
general
told
us
that
since
these
problems
arose,
ohio
law
now
requires
some
kind
of
a
license
for
waste
dumps
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
burger
does
it
also
require
them
to
put
up
a
bond
to
cover
situations
like
this?
and
did
it
apply?
chief
justice
burger
but
it
didn't
apply
at
the
time?
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
what
you
have
suggested
to
us...
and
your
colleague,
your
friend
seemed
to
imply
the
same
thing...
the
cost
of
meeting
this
problem
is
going
to
run
into
millions
or
hundreds
of
millions.
chief
justice
burger
then,
isn't
the
question
of
dischargability
in
bankruptcy
really
academic,
unless
this
man
wins
a
billion
dollar
lottery
or
something?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
counsel.
if
you
have
a
fact
statement
to
make,
you
make
it;
yes.
chief
justice
burger
the
court
should
be
provided
with
a
copy.
chief
justice
burger
or
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
chief
justice
burger
whatever
factual
information
you
provide,
it
would
be
more
helpful
to
the
court
if
it's
provided
as
an
agreed
statement
of
what
the
facts
are.
whether
it's
relevant
to
the
decision
of
this
case
remains
to
be
seen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
