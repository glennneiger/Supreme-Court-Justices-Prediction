justice
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
mr.
kovacs
has
or
has
not
cooperate
with
the
receiver?
justice
stevens
well,
but
i'm
asking
about
the
cleanup.
in
the
cleanup
activities,
in
which
i
guess
he's
ordered
to
cooperate
with
them,
does
the
record
show
whether
he
has
or
has
not
cooperated?
justice
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
is
the
obligation
that
you
want
to
have
immune
from
being
discharged,
is
that
part
of
the
order
appointing
the
receiver
of
february
4,
1980?
justice
stevens
which
paragraphs
of
that
order
do
you
say
are
not--
justice
stevens
--where
is
that?
i
always
have
trouble
finding
exactly
where--
--i
think
the
closest
thing
to
it
is
that
he's
supposed
to
let
the
receiver
into
the
site
and
not
interfere
with
his
efforts
to
clean
it
up.
i
don't
see
any
order
to
cooperate.
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask...
assuming
that
we
have
two
insolvent
people
here,
apparently,
both
kovacs
and
the
state
of
ohio.
supposing
both
had
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars,
had
all
the
money
in
the
world
to
do
the
work,
could
the
injunctive
obligation
then
be
cashed
in
to--
justice
stevens
--no,
but
why
couldn't
ohio
do
the
cleanup
and
say
pay
us
back?
justice
stevens
but
you
know
it
by
the
time
you
do
the
work.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
a
person
who
gets,
in
this
sort
of
situation,
who
has
millions
and
millions
of
dollars,
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
he
can
discharge
his
obligation
by
paying
the
state
whatever
they
think
is
necessary?
justice
stevens
mr.
caldwell,
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
please?
assume
we
didn't
have
the
complex
facts
we
have
here.
we
had
a
simple
case
in
which
somebody
polluted
a
large
area
of
land
and
the
environmental
agency
went
into
court
and
got
an
order
that
said
clean
it
up,
do
whatever
you
have
to
to
clean
it
up.
and
they
started
to
work,
trying
to
clean
it
up,
and
they
ran
out
of
money
and
went
into
bankruptcy,
but
there
was
no
settlement,
no
completion,
they
don't
know
how
much
more
it
would
cost
to
just
have
that
kind
of
general
open-ended
obligation.
in
your
view,
would
that...
and
then
the
man
was
broke,
and
moved
to
new
jersey,
as
this
man
did.
would
that
be
dischargable?
justice
stevens
that's
basically
the
same
case
in
your
judgment.
justice
stevens
forever,
apparently.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
factual
question?
i
understood
ms.
oberly
to
say
that
he
has,
in
fact,
been
discharged.
the
discharge
is
already
complete.
is
that
right?
i
thought
it
was--
--yes.
he
has
been
granted
a
discharge.
he
has
been.
and
it's
a
total
discharge
with
no
continuing
obligation
of
any
kind?
justice
stevens
this
case.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
right.
but
if
the
judgment,
if
the
judgment
is
affirmed,
there
is
a
discharge.
justice
stevens
any
obligation
under
the
injunction...
except
not
to--
justice
stevens
--no.
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
follow-up
to
a
question
justice
rehnquist
asked
earlier?
if
you
prevail
in
this
case
and
this
obligation,
whatever
it
is,
is
treated
as
a
claim
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
statute,
then
does
that
mean
that
the
state
is
a
general
creditor
to
the
extent
it
has
a
monetary
demand
on
your
client?
justice
stevens
maybe
there's
nothing
there;
i
don't
know.
is
there
in
that
estate?
justice
stevens
now,
are
these
facts
in
the
record
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stevens
should
we
not
decide
the
case
on
the
same
record
they
did?
