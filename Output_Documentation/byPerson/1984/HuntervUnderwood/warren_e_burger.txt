we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
hunter
against
underwood,
et
al.--
mr.
ward,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
if
north
dakota
or
wyoming
or
some
states
who
were
not
involved
in
those
days
passed
this
same
statute
now,
you
think
it
would
be
sustained.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
still?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
mr.
still,
that
the
1901
attitudes
were
a
continuation
of
the
jefferson
point
of
view
that
only
the
property
class
should
vote.
is
that
not
a
matter
of
history?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
provision
with
respect
to
whites
in
the
1901
constitution
would
violate...
do
you
think
it
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
even
if
it
didn't
violate
the
fifteenth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
ward?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
