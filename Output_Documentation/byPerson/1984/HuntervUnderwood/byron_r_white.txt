justice
white
could
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
you
suggest
that
we
should
look
at
the
law
at
it
presently
stands
and
that
the
past
is
largely
irrelevant.
what
about
the
finding
or
the
statement,
observation
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
this
discriminatory
effect
persists
today?
justice
white
well,
what
if
i
accept
it
though?
justice
white
what
if
that
observation
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
be
accepted?
justice
white
yes.
that
the
law
which
was
passed
was
a
discriminatory
intent,
had
a
discriminatory
effect
and
that
it
still
does?
what
if
we
accept
that?
what
happens
to
your
argument?
justice
white
well,
that
is
a
different
argument.
that
is
a
different
argument.
i
thought
your
argument
had
been
that
as
of
today
this
statute
should
be
accepted
as
having
a
neutral
non-discriminatory
purpose
and
impact.
justice
white
well,
you
think
alabama
may
continue
it
if
it
has
a
discriminatory
impact
today?
justice
white
well,
should
we
judge
the
case
on
the
basis
that
this
observation
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct?
is
it
supported
by
the
record?
justice
white
you
don't
believe
it
is,
but--
justice
white
i
take
it
the
import
of
your
argument,
present
argument
is
that
without
any
consideration
of
race
this
statute
is
invalid.
justice
white
because
it
picks
and
chooses
among
almost
identical
kind.
justice
white
are
you
relying
upon
it
here?
justice
white
as
another
ground
for
affirmance?
justice
white
was
it
credible?
justice
white
did
they
say
not
legally
valid?
justice
white
on
the
grounds
of
discrimination
on
the
equal
protection--
justice
white
--so
they
just
said
their
explanation
was
not
credible?
justice
white
what
was
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
that
this
particular
provision
is
just
invalid
on
its
face?
justice
white
both
blacks
and
whites?
justice
white
why
do
the
whites
get
the
benefit
of
it?
justice
white
you
say
what
you
are
relying
on
is
that
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
discriminate
against
blacks.
