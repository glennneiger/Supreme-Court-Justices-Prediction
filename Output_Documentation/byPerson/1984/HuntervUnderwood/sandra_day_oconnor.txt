mr.
ward--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
concede
that
the
statute
presently
has
a
discriminatory
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ward,
i
did
have
one
more
question.
the
court
of
appeals
also
indicated,
i
think
in
a
footnote,
that
the
statute
was
under-inclusive
because
sometimes
that
apparently
it
would
be
characterized
at
least
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
crimes
of
moral
turpitude
are
not
included
such
as
mailing
pornography
and
so
forth.
is
that
accurate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
still,
do
you
think
that
the
state
is
forever
bound
by
that
original
discriminatory
purpose
or
can
the
passage
of
time
and
circumstances
ultimately
change
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
your
view
then
is
the
felony
disinfrancishement
provision
equally
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
answer
is
yes--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
it
is
also
invalid?
