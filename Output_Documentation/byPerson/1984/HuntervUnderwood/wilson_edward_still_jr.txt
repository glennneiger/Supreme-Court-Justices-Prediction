mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
john
knox
opened
the
1901
constitutional
convention,
he
stated
its
purpose
very
clearly.
he
said,
and
what
is
it
we
want
to
do
while
it
is
within
the
limits
imposed
by
the
federal
constitution
to
establish
white
supremacy
in
this
state.
he
went
on
to
say
that
they
wanted
to
establish
white
supremacy
by
law
rather
than
by
force
and
violence.
historians,
including
the
two
who
testified
in
this
case,
one
for
the
plaintiffs
and
one
for
the
defendant,
are
unanimous
that
the
1901
alabama
constitution
succeeded
in
meeting
this
goal
of
establishing
white
supremacy
by
law.
the
appellants'
brief
even
said
that
the
entire
suffrage
article
had
the
intention
to
disfranchise
poor
whites
as
well
as
blacks.
suffrage
was
one
of
the
principal
issues
of
the
1901
constitutional
convention.
every
time
the
issue
came
up,
the
debate
centered
on
the
relative
effects
of
a
particular
provision
on
blacks
and
whites
or
among
different
groups
of
whites.
there
were
no
delegates
at
that
convention.
all
of
the
delegates
were
white
by
the
way.
there
were
delegates
at
that
convention
who
stood
up
and
suggested
that
blacks
should
be
given
a
full,
free,
and
equal
franchise
with
whites.
instead,
the
debate
was
over
how
far
to
take
the
disfranchisement
of
blacks
and
how
far
to
take
the
disfranchisement
of
others.
now--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--i
believe
they
are
bound.
in
this
court's
decision
in
city
of
richmond
versus
the
united
states
just
two
years
ago
the
court
said
an
official
action
taken
for
the
purposes
of
discriminating
against
negros
on
account
of
their
race
has
no
legitimacy
at
all
under
our
constitution.
and,
in
the
arlington
heights
case,
the
court
said
that
racial
discrimination
is
not
just
another
competing
consideration.
when
you
find
racial
discrimination,
that
should
be
the
judicial
deference
that
goes
along
with
state
laws
evaporates.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
that
whole
provision,
section
182,
would
probably
have
to
be
rewritten,
but
i
think
we
would
have
to--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--no.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
no,
because
the
1875
constitution
disfranchised
the
felons,
so
we
would
have
to
compare
it
against
what
they
had
before
and
go
back
to
the
provision
that
they
had
previously
which
would
disfranchise
felons
only
and
not
misdemeanors.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
i
believe
that
was
jefferson's
view.
but,
the
1901
constitutional
convention
had,
of
course,
many
view
points
in
it
but
they
were
primarily
interested
in
disfranchising
blacks.
in
fact,
the
democratic
party
had
agreed
to
have
the
constitutional
convention
on
a
pledge
that
they
would
disfranchise
blacks
and
not
whites
and
they
were
elected
to
the
convention
on
that
basis.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
1901
constitution
as
applied
to
whites
have
been
struck
and
as
applied
to
all
people.
for
instance,
the
poll
tax
was
struck
down
in
alabama
in
1966
in
u.s.
versus
alabama.
so,
there
are
many
provisions
of
this
constitution
that
have
been
struck
down
on
general
equal
protection,
non-racial
grounds
over
the
years.
the
grandfather
clause,
for
instance,
which
this
court
struck
down
in
keoun
versus
oklahoma.
there
was
never
any
particular
case
about
it
in
alabama,
but
it
is
invalid
under
keoun
versus
oklahoma.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
legislature
of
alabama
would
adopt
this
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
adopted
a
different
constitutional
provision.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
all
right.
if
they
adopted
this
same
provision--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--well,
the
plaintiffs
would
still
have
to
show
in
that
kind
of
situation
that
the...
whether
or
not
the
provision
had
been
adopted
for
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
and
then
also
they
would
still
be
allowed
to
show
whether
or
not
it
had
a
racially
discriminatory
effect.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
well,
my
answer
would
be
same
whether
they
enact
it
for
the
first
time
or
they
re-enact
it.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
i
am
saying
the
plantiffs
would
have
to
prove
that.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
i
am
saying
the
plantiffs
would
have
to
prove
that.
it
would
depend
upon
the
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
alabama
would
adopt
this
provision
today.
as
i
said,
two
years
ago
they
adopted
a
whole
new
constitution
or
proposed
one
which
did
not
include
this
provision.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
no,
sir,
no
your
honor.
my
answer
is
if
alabama
does
it
tomorrow
the
plaintiffs
will
have
to
prove
the
same
thing
they
proved
in
this
case,
but
i
am
not
predicting
what
the
proof
will
be
because
i
do
not
believe
that
alabama
will
adopt
this
provision
based
on
what
they
did
two
years
ago.
there
was
a
whole
new
constitution
proposed
two
years
ago
which
did
not
include
this
particular
provision
and
that
constitution
has
not
yet
come
to
a
vote
of
the
people
of
alabama
because
of
a
technicality
with
the
alabama
supreme
court
who
said
you
can't
propose
a
whole
constitution
in
the
way
they
did.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--no,
this--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
not
said
that
they
could
not
show
it
was
invalid.
i
have
said
the
plaintiffs
would
have
to
prove
that
it
would
be
invalid.
it
is
my
contention--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--i
believe
they
can
prove
that
it
is
invalid
because
of
its
present
continuing
effect.
now
whether
they
would
be
able
to
prove
it
still
had
that
intent
tomorrow
i
don't
know.
it
depends
on
what
the
evidence
shows
in
the
case.
turning
back
to
1901
though
we
know
that
that
had
a
discriminatory
purpose.
the
author
of
the
provision
said
i
have
written
this
to
have
a
discriminatory
purpose.
everyone
at
the
convention
assumed
that
it
did
and
all
historians
have
agreed
that
no
one
disputed
that
point.
in
fact,
the
defendants'
own
expert,
the
appellants'
own
expert
testified
that
90
percent
of
the
people
who
were
disfranchised
in
the
first
year
after
the
passage
of
the
constitution
for
commission
of
a
misdemeanor
were
black.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
i
think
in
any
type
of
test
that
you
apply
that
this
situation
in
alabama
is
going
to
be
held
to
be
discriminatory
because
the
racial--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--well,
i
do
not
know
how
much
is
necessary.
i
am
simply
saying
that
under
any
test
that
has
been
proposed
by
any
of
the
justices
of
this
court
in
any
of
their
opinions
over
the
last
ten
years
or
so,
that
this
meets
the
test
because
there
was
such
a
pervasive
racial
attitude
in
that
convention
that
everyone
wanted
to
discriminate
against
blacks
in
terms
of
voting.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
i
would
suggest
that.
i
would
suggest
that
the
tests
that
have
been
enunciated
in
arlington
heights
and
in
rogers
versus
lodge
are
tests
that
have
been
adopted
by
the
majority
of
this
court
and
that
this
would
be
proven
to
be
discriminatory
under
either
one
of
those
tests.
actually
what
we
have
in
this
situation
though
is
this
court
has
identified
over
the
years
three
different
kinds
of
discriminatory
laws.
there
are
the
ones
that
overtly
discriminate,
say
race
is
a
factor
such
as
brown
versus
board
of
education.
then
there
is
the
kind
that
have
been
described
as
an
obvious
pretext
towards
discrimination
such
yick
wo
versus
hopkins
or
gomillion
versus
lightfoot.
and
the
third
type
is
disproportionate
impact
on
minorities
such
as
washington
versus
davis
and
arlington
heights.
this
case
falls
into
that
second
category.
this
is
a
yick
wo
type
case.
yick
wo
was
a
pretty
transparent
provision
passed
by
the
san
francisco
city
council.
this
is
a--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--well--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--it
was--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--that
is
right.
well,
perhaps
i
should
depend
upon
gomillion
then
which
we
know
was
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
and,
gomillion
is
another
example
of
a
pretty
transparent
law.
it
eliminated
practically
every
black
person
from
the
city
of
tuskegee
and
left
practically
every
white
person
in
the
city
of
tuskegee.
so,
this
is
that
same
type
of
obvious
pretext
for
discrimination.
in
that
kind
of
case,
you
don't
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
worrying
about
what
test
you
are
going
to
apply
because
all
you
have
to
do
is
cut
through
the
pretext
and
say
we
know
what
the
decision
is.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
if
you
had
that
kind
of
evidence
in
this
case,
that
would
be
a
contraindication
to
the
evidence
that
we
have,
but
as
one
of
the
expert
witnesses
said,
while
the
evidence
may
be
circumstantial
it
all
points
in
the
same
direction
and
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
we
have
here.
all
of
the
circumstantial
evidence
points
in
the
same
direction.
now,
the
question
was
asked
earlier,
what
do
other
states
do?
alabama
is
the
only
state
that
disfranchises
misdemeanors
on
the
basis
of
committing
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
there
are
seven
states
that
disfranchise
everybody
convicted
of
any
crime
while
they
are
serving
their
sentence
and,
of
course,
with
a
misdemeanor
that
is
going
to
be
less
than
a
year.
there
are
five
states
that
disfranchise
people
convicted
of
felonies
and
election
laws.
there
is
one
state
that
disfranchises
people
convicted
of
election
laws
only.
now,
alabama
and
mississippi
are
the
only
two
states
that
have
lists
in
their
constitution
and
the
lists
say
here
are
the
crimes
that
are
to
be
disfranchised.
mississippi's
list
does
not
say
and
crimes
of
moral
turpitude.
now,
the
question
was
also
asked,
what
is
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude
in
alabama?
i
wish
i
knew
the
answer
to
that.
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
said
it
is
a
crime
that
is
inherently
evil
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
alabama,
in
giving
one
of
his
opinions
to
a
board
of
registrars,
listing
all
the
crimes
that
had
been
found
to
be
crimes
of
moral
turpitude,
said,
well,
there
may
be
some
other
crimes
that
are
moral
turpitude,
it
all
depends
on
the
moral
standards
of
the
judges
who
happen
to
be
hearing
particular
cases.
so,
moral
turpitude
in
alabama
is
a
somewhat
fluid
concept
and
i
suppose
drunk
driving
offenses
could
become
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude
if
the
alabama
supreme
court
decides
that
they
are
crimes
of
moral
turpitude.
mr.
ward
and
the
appellants
have
claimed
that
the
affirmative
sanction
of
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
allows
them
to
disfranchise
on
the
basis
of
misdemeanors
of
moral
turpitude.
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
is
that
the
state
may
disfranchise
on
the
basis
of
participation
in
rebellion
or
other
crime.
it
doesn't
say
you
get
to
pick
and
choose
among
the
other
crimes
or
among
the
people
who
participate
in
rebellion.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
if
you
overdraw
your
bank
account,
if
you
have
a
non-sufficient
funds
check
and
the
merchant
sends
you
the
check
or
sends
you
a
certified
letter
that
says
i
have
got
your
check
for
$25,
come
in
here
within
ten
days
and
clear
this
up,
and
you
don't
respond
to
the
letter,
that
is
considered
to
be
prima
facie
evidence
that
you
intended
to
defraud
the
person,
that
you
intended
to
give
him
a
worthless
check.
if
you
go
and
clear
it
up,
the
case
is
dropped.
then,
of
course,
you
are
able
to
rebut
that
presumption.
the
offense
that
the
two
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
convicted
of
was
a
first
offense.
it
carries
a
$100
fine.
even
with
repeated
offenses
in
alabama,
you
can
only
get,
i
think,
a
$400
fine
for
passing
a
bad
check.
you
can't
even
get
any
jail
time
under
the
particular
law
that
they
were
convicted
of.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
i
believe
there
is
an
opinion
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
this
particular
case.
usually
cases
get...
crimes
get
defined
as
being
crimes
of
moral
turpitude
because
it
comes
up
in
a
question
about
whether
a
witness
is
credible
or
not,
so
it
comes
up
that
way,
and
it
is
a
collateral
attack
in
effect
on
the
original
conviction
of
the
person.
but,
most
of
the
time,
if
a
persons
seeks
to
be
registered
to
vote
and
the
board
of
registrars
has
some
question
about
it,
they
will
hold
the
person's
registration
certificate
and
write
to
the
attorney
general
for
an
opinion.
there
are
some
interesting
anomalies
in
alabama's
decisions
about
what
is
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
for
instance,
selling
untaxed,
illegal
liquor
is
not
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude
but
selling
narcotics
is
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude
in
alabama.
and,
as
i
said,
driving
while
intoxicated
may
become
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude
in
alabama
some
time
soon.
but,
the
affirmative
sanction
of
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
the
appellants
rely
on,
as
i
say,
does
not
allow
a
state
to
pick
and
choose
among
those
crimes
and
say,
well,
we
are
going
to
disfranchise
some
people
within
this
category
and
not
others.
the
fourteenth
amendment
cannot
provide
a
shield
to
the
state
of
alabama
any
more
than
the
twenty-first
amendment
can
provide
a
shield
to
a
state
that
says
we
are
going
to
set
one
drinking
age
for
boys
and
another
drinking
age
for
girls.
this
court--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--yes.
that
is
another
claim
that
we
made.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
that
particular
argument
that
we
made
has
not
yet
been
ruled
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
one
of
the
issues
that
they
have
not
yet
ruled
upon.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
i
rely
upon
it
to
the
extent
that
i
believe
that
it
may
assist
the
court
in
making--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--yes,
as
another
ground
for
affirmance.
but,
i
also
believe
that
if
this
court
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
would
then
have
to
decide
that
particular
issue.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
also
analyzed
the
state's
reasons
for
adopting
section
182,
the
reasons
they
proffered.
they
found
that
those
reasons
were
not
supported
in
the
record
as
being
reasons
that
had
actually
been
considered
at
the
1901
convention
and
they
also
found
them
to
be
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
the
state
said
we
have
got
a
right
to
disfranchise
people
who
were
convicted
of
crimes
of
moral
turpitude
or
any
type
of
crime
that
we
want
to
use
and
they
cite
the
case
of
washington
versus
state
which
was
decided
about
a
decade
and
a
half
before
the
constitutional
convention.
they
were
unable
to
show
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
any
citation
in
the
records...
we
have
a
verbatim
record
of
the
constitutional
convention...
any
place
anybody
debated
the
existence,
even
mentioned
the
existence
of
the
washington
versus
state
case.
and
then
also
because
of
this
picking
and
choosing
feature
the
court
held
that
the
state
was
not
using
the
best
means
available
to
meet
its
particular
end.
for
instance,
in
alabama
it
is
not
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude
to
assault
a
police
officer.
it
is
not
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude
to
be
convicted
of
second
degree
manslaughter.
each
one
of
those
is
a
relatively
serious
offense
that
is
going
to
get
you
a
lengthy
jail
term
but
still
a
misdemeanor,
much
more
than
you
can
get
for
passing
a
bad
check
for
which
you
can
get
no
jail
time
at
all
and
yet
neither
one
of
those
offenses
is
an
offense
that
will
disfranchise
one.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
because
of
that
that
the
state's
argument
about
picking
and
choosing
or
wanting
to
disfranchise
people
who
had
been
convicted
of
violating
the
state's
laws
was
not
legally
valid.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
i
believe
they--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--they
rejected
it
as
being
an
insufficient
grounds
because
they
said...
you
say
you
want
to
disfranchise
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
violating
your
laws,
but
you
leave
out
a
lot
of
serious
offenses
and
reach
down
and
get
people--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--they
said
the
explanation
was
not
credible.
they
said
there
also
was
no
evidence
to
support
that
anybody
had
even
discussed
that
idea.
instead,
all
of
this
discussion,
i
reiterate,
in
the
1901
convention
about
the
suffrage
article
was
about
the
racial
effect
of
those
provisions.
there
were
discussions
about
how
many
blacks
and
how
many
whites
it
would
disfranchise.
they
ended
up
with
a
package
of
laws
which
were
obviously
to
disfranchise
as
many
blacks
as
possible
and
to
leave
as
many
whites
as
possible
on
the
voting
rolls.
they
put
this
provision,
section
182,
in
specifically
because
the
list
of
crimes
was
a
list
of
crimes
that
the
sponsor
had
determined
to
be
ones
that
blacks
committed
more
often
than
whites.
for
these
reasons
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
ought
to
be
affirmed
in
this
case.
i
would
point
out
that
the
remand
of
the
case
from
the
court
of
appeals
has
already
taken
place
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
has
already
entered
a
final
order.
and,
the
class
of
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
many
of
them
have
already
gone
down
and
sought
to
be
reinfranchised.
i
believe
that
this
court
should
not
interfere
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
should
affirm
it.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
they
declared
it
to
be
invalid
as
applied
to
misdemeanors.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
yes,
as
to
both
blacks
and
whites.
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
well,
because
the
provision
is--
mr.
wilson
edward
still,
jr.
--in
all
other
cases
that
i
know
of
where
a
court
has
invalidated
a
law
on
the
basis
that
it
was
infected
with
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
and
it
also
had
some
effect
on
whites
as
well
as
on
blacks.
they
have
just
struck
down
the
law.
they
have
not
said
let's
have
different
laws
for
whites
and
blacks.
so,
i
think
what
they
did
in
this
case
was
consistent
with
what
this
court
and
other
courts
have
done
in
the
past.
the
effect
of
the
court's
decision
was
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
enter
a
judgment
and
the
district
court
did
so
within
a
couple
of
months.
thank
you.
