justice
thurgood
marshall
why
isn't
it
that
you
haven't
mentioned
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
alleged.
it
is
in
the
complaint.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
in
the
case.
why
do
you
say
the
first
and
fourteenth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fifteenth
amendment
says
no
discrimination
of
any
kind
by
anybody.
isn't
that
what
the
fifteenth
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
haven't
taken
any
position
on
that.
i
just
want
to
know
why
you
have
left
it
out
of
the
argument.
do
you
agree
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
applies?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
controls
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
don't
you
argue
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
still,
what
worries
me
is
suppose
the
legislature
of
alabama
tomorrow
adopts
this
same
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
mind
assuming
that
hypothetical.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
worries
me
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
enact.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
say
that
tomorrow
alabama
would
do
it
on
racial
grounds?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
tomorrow.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
evidence
do
you
have
to
alabama
doing
it
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i
asked
is
if
alabama
does
it
tomorrow
it
still
will
be
unconstitutional,
is
that
your
answer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
would
be
valid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
was
adopted
tomorrow,
it
would
be...
you
said
they
couldn't
show
it
was
invalid.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
wouldn't
that
be--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--well,
they
can't
prove
it
is
invalid
or
can
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
still
i
say
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
ordinance
in
yick
wo.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yick
wo
said
it
was
enforced
with
a
discriminatory
purpose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
didn't
knock
the
statute
out,
it
knocked
its
enforcement
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
