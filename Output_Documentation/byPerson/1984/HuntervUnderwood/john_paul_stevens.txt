justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
get
too
deeply
into
your
argument,
what
is
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude?
i
mean,
where
do
you
look
for
the
definition
of
that
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
is
no
one
statutory
frame
of
reference
such
as
a
list
that
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--nobody
denies
that
this
particular...
that
check
offense
was
a
moral
turpitude
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
drunken
driving
just
out
of
curiosity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ward,
doesn't
that
argument
assume...
this
is
sort
of
the
same
thought
justice
blackmun
was
asking
you
about...
that
there
are
other
states
which
would
pass
a
statute
like
this
for
a
non-racial
purpose
and
i
don't
know
if
there
are
any
such
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they
could
do
it
if
they
defined
moral
turpitude
to
include
all
traffic
offenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
you
just
think
they
want
to
insist
on
obedience
of
the
law,
traffic
laws
are
important
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
lot
of
people
are
killed
on
the
highways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
your
approach...
looking
at
just
today's...
what
if
the
evidence
showed
for
the
first
30
years
or
whatever
period
it
might
be
that
the
statute
or
the
constitutional
provision
did
abridge
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
and
flatly
violated
the
fifteenth
amendment
for
the
first
20
or
30
years
of
this
effect.
would
it
be
your
view
that
it
was
invalid
during
that
period
and
then
by
reason
of
passage
of
time
it
kind
of
blossomed
into
something
that
became
valid?
is
that
how
it
goes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
analysis
in
effect
acknowledge
that
it
was
invalid
for
a
short...
during
its
original
effective
period
or
you
say
we
just
don't
even
have
to
consider
that
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
but,
in
your
brief
you
took
a
little
different
position.
you
said
that
it
wasn't
invalid
originally
because
it
had
an
additional
purpose,
to
disinfranchise
poor
whites
as
well
as
blacks.
i
am
just
wondering
whether
you...
what
is
your
present
position
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
this
constitutional
provision
during
the
first
10
or
15
years
of
its
life?
what
do
you
say
about
that?
in
your
brief
you
argue
it
was
always
constitutional.
i
don't
know
whether
you
are
still
arguing
that
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
moral
turpitude
and
the
particular
offense
here
which
i
guess
was
passing
a
worthless
check.
what
are
the
contours
of
the
particular
offense
here?
is
it
if
you
overdraw
your
bank
account,
is
that--
justice
stevens
--is
it
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general?
how
do
we
know
it
is
moral
turpitude?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
