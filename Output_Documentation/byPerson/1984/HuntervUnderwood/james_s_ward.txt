mr.
james
s.
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
may
of
1978,
carmen
edward,
a
black
female,
was
told
that
she
could
not
register
to
vote
because
she
had
been
convicted
of
the
crime
of
issuing
a
worthless
check
which
under
state
law
is
one
involved
moral
turpitude.
that
decision
to
refuse
her
her
vote
was
based
upon
the
constitution
of
1901
and
section
182
which
allows
the
disfranchisement
of
voters
for
conviction
of
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
that
specific
crime
is
not
on
the
list.
the
statutory
offense
for
which
she
was
committed,
issuing
a
worthless
check,
did
not
become
a
statutory
crime
until
1971.
so,
the
justification
for
his
disfranchisement
would
fit
under
the
provision
of
the
constitutional
provision
of
1901
which
allows
disfranchisement
for
those
who
commit
any
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
a
month
later
in
june
of
1978,
mrs.
edwards,
along
with
a
while
male,
mr.
underwood,
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
alleging
that
section
182
violated
various
rights
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
constitution.
that
complaint
was
later
amended
to
include
five
causes
of
action.
three
of
the
causes
of
action
were
disposed
of
in
pre-trial.
the
case
was
tried
on
the
cause
of
action
that
specific
crimes
had
been
added
to
section
182
with
the
intent
to
disfranchise
blacks
and
that
the
statute
has
had
that
effect
presently.
mr.
james
s.
ward
presently?
mr.
james
s.
ward
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
there
are
non-felons
disfranchised
for
commission
of
various
election
offenses
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
felony.
but,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
specific
state
that
allows
blanketly
at
least
that.
i
am
sure
there
are
some
states
that
allow
disfranchisement
for
misdemeanors
depending
on
how
the
statute
is
written.
if
the
state
court
would
define
a
misdemeanor
as
being
an
infamous
crime
and
the
provision
of
law
in
that
state
allowed
for
that
to
happen,
then
i
think,
yes.
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
appellees
to
show
that
182
was
passed
with
the
intent
to
disfranchise
blacks
and
also
that
even
if
that
had
been
shown
there
was
a
permissible
motive
for
section
182
and,
therefore,
under
palmer
and
michael
m.
the
statute
was
allowed
to
stand.
on
appeal
the
court
below
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
intent
to
disfranchise
blacks
have
been
shown
by
the
inclusion
of
the
certain
crimes,
those
crimes
being
misdemeanors
and
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude
and
that
the
appellants
here
have
failed
to
prove
that
there
was
a
permissible
motive.
it
is
the
appellants'
contention
now
before
this
court
that
section
182
must
be
viewed
and
analyzed
as
it
exists
now,
not
as
it
existed
84
years
ago
when
it
was
passed.
today
the
effect
of
section
182
is
as
follows:
the
only
crimes
for
which
one
can
be
disfranchised
in
our
state
are
ones
involving
moral
turpitude
or
which
are
a
felony.
no
one
can
be
disfranchised
for
the
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor
in
and
of
itself.
it
has
to
be
a
misdemeanor
involving
moral
turpitude
or
a
felony.
all
crimes
on
the
list
which
do
not
involve
moral
turpitude
are
no
longer
good
crimes
in
our
state.
by
various
court
decisions
or
decision
of
this
court,
they
have
been
stricken.
so,
you
are
dealing
now
with
a
statute
which,
as
it
presently
works,
includes
within
its
proscriptions
those
who
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony
or
one
convicted
of
a
moral
turpitude
crime
and
makes
no
distinction
as
to
whether
it
is
a
misdemeanor
or
not.
if
the
crime
involves
moral
turpitude,
that
is
the
disfranchising
fractor.
that
is
the
occurrence
that
allows
the
state
to
disfranchise,
not
its
punishment
as
opposed
to
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor.
we
feel
it
is--
mr.
james
s.
ward
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
ward
no,
ma'am.
i
would
be
very
blind
and
naive
and
try
to
come
up
and
stand
before
this
court
and
say
that
race
was
not
a
factor
in
the
enactment
of
section
182;
that
race
did
not
play
a
part
in
the
decisions
of
those
people
who
were
at
the
constitutional
convention
of
1901
and
i
won't
do
that.
my
point
is
that
the
effect
of
the
statute
today
could
be
and
probably
is
based
on
reasons
that
are
legitimate
reasons
that
the
state
can
consider.
if
the
difference
in
treatment
is
the
result
of
those
committing
moral
turpitude
crimes
or
others
or
a
certain
class
or
group
committing
more
felonies
than
others,
then
the
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
is
the
effect
or
the
numbers
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
race.
if
crimes
were
selected
because
there
was
proof
that
more
than
one
group
committed
those
crimes
as
opposed
to
another
group,
the
answer
to
your
question
may
be
different
the
point
is
those
crimes
now
viable
all
involve
moral
turpitude
and
to
us
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
84
years
later
can
have
in
operation
a
provision
of
law
that
disfranchises
felons
and
moral
turpitude
offenders
regardless
of
what
the
punishment
is.
i
believe
that
analysis
is
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions
in
some
such
cases
as
doyle,
arlington,
and
in
davis.
the
important
factor
there
was
to
look
at
whether
there
could
be
a
justification
for
the
continued
validity
of
a
decision.
in
all
those
cases...
in
each
one
of
those
cases,
there
is
an
immediate
decision.
a
decision
was
made,
it
was
challenged,
and
the
parties
knew
immediately
that
that
decision
would
be
allowed
to
continue
or
would
have
to
stop.
therefore,
the
factors
that
were
considered
in
trying
to
determine
whether
that
decision
was
valid
or
not
were
all
there
presently.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
difference.
we
have
the
inexorable
problem
of
the
passage
of
time.
this
act
was
not
challenged
until
some
77
years
after
it
was
passed
and
here
it
is
84
years
later.
and,
i
read
nothing
in
any
of
those
cases,
in
the
doyle
case,
in
the
arlington
case,
or
washington
versus
davis
that
says
this
court
or
any
court
can't
consider
the
present-day
factors
or
the
present-day
justifications
for
something
in
trying
to
determine
whether
the
state
would
have
a
legitimate
or
valid
motive
for
the
passage
of
the
complained
of
act.
the
court
allows--
mr.
james
s.
ward
your
honor,
they
do
not
make
it.
they
say
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
disfranchise
those
who
commit
crimes
and
are
defining
crime
as
a
felony.
the
way
i
read
this
court's
opinion
in
the
richardson
case,
there
is...
the
state
would
have
the
authority
to
disfranchise
all
felons
which
this
statute
does.
the
question
becomes,
well,
does
the
fact
that
there
was
a
racial
motive
involved
in
its
passage,
although
it
applies
to
all
felons,
would
that
make
a
difference.
the
way
i
read
richardson
it
would
not;
that
the
second
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
allows
the
states
to
disfranchise
felons...
and
i
am
going
to
argue
in
a
minute,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
it
is
not
limited
just
to
felons...
but
in
the
richardson
case
that
the
section
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
could
not
be...
excuse
me.
that
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
could
not
limit
what
was
affirmatively
given
to
the
states
by
the
second.
so,
the
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
is
no,
i
don't
think
they
could
say
that.
mr.
james
s.
ward
in
our
state,
your
honor,
you
look
at
several
places.
the
first
place
you
look
is
to
the
afforded
court
decisions.
most
crimes
which
involve
moral
turpitude
in
our
state
are
the
subject
of
a
court
opinion
and
appellate
court
opinion,
either
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
or
the
supreme
court,
or
a
subject
of
opinion
from
the
state
attorney
general's
office.
the
testimony
at
trial
showed
that
the
registrars,
in
determining
whether
a
crime
involved
moral
turpitude
or
not,
would
either
consult
the
attorney
general's
opinions,
the
case
law,
or
if
that
did
not
help
them,
they
would
seek
the
advice
of
the
local
district
attorney
or
the
state's
attorney.
mr.
james
s.
ward
no,
sir,
there
is
not,
although
there
are
cases
which
put
out
a
list,
but
there
is
no
list
within
the
statute
itself.
mr.
james
s.
ward
no,
sir,
that
is
agreed
upon
by
everyone.
mr.
james
s.
ward
no,
sir.
mr.
james
s.
ward
would
not
nor
can
you
lose
your
right
to
vote
for
drunken
driving.
it
is
suggested
then
that
if
you
look
at
the
present
state
of
affairs
and
the
present
justifications
that
section
182
would
be
allowed
to
operate
and
should
not
be
stricken
down.
in
saying
that
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
it
has
on
other
occasions,
and
i
am
referring
now
specifically
to
the
doyle
case,
which
would
involve
the
case
of
challenged
conduct,
first
amendment
conduct,
asks
what
is
the
cause
and
if
the
cause
is
not
based
on
the
unconstitutional
problem
but
the
cause
was
based
on
something
else,
then
the
decision
should
be
allowed
to
stand.
and,
in
doyle
this
court
lists
some
of
those
things,
where
a
confession
is
obtained
which
is
invalid.
later
on
it
can
be
cured
by
an
intervening
time,
so
the
cause
of
the
confession
therefore
is
not
what
it
was
when
it
started.
or
if
an
arrest
is
made
and
that
arrest
is
bad
and
a
confession
given,
things
can
occur
in
the
meantime
where
a
second
confession
would
be
valid
and,
therefore,
the
cause
of
the
confession,
therefore,
would
be
not
be
the
initial
taint.
if
it
is
argued
or
assumed
that
there
is
some
taint
involved
in
the
initial
enactment
of
section
182,
we
say
that
that
taint,
if
any,
has
been
cured
because
of,
first
of
all,
what
the
statute
now
says,
and,
secondly,
because
of
the
interest
in
the
state
pursuant
to
various...
to
the
tenth
amendment
and
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
conduct
their
affairs
in
this
area.
perhaps
stated
another
way,
if
north
dakota
today
or
wyoming
passed
a
law
which
said
that
we
will
disfranchise
those
that
commit
moral
turpitude
crimes,
would
that
be
lawful,
would
that
be
within
the
exercise
of
the
tenth
amendment
power
or
would
it
not?
the
fact
that
alabama,
the
start
of
alabama's,
the
root
of
alabama's
provision
was
84
years
ago
should
not
treat
that
state
differently
today
whereas
other
states
under
the
same
circumstances
today
could
pass
it.
mr.
james
s.
ward
your
honor,
i
don't
either
but
that
is
assuming
that
the
state
would
not
have
that
right.
i
would
feel
quite
strong
in
saying
that
the
state
would
have
a
right
to
pass
a
law,
fair
on
its
face,
applied
in
a
fair
manner
that
made
moral
turpitude
a
difference
in
whether
one
would
vote;
that
the
tenth
amendment
would
give
the
state
that
right
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
would.
mr.
james
s.
ward
no,
sir.
i
think--
mr.
james
s.
ward
--well,
they
are--
mr.
james
s.
ward
--well,
perhaps
if
that
specific
finding
was
made.
that,
again,
is
perhaps
a
decision
best
left
to
the
states.
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
should
this
state
in
this
case
be
denuded
of
the
ability
to
impose
restrictions
on
the
franchise.
the
way
the
statute
operates
today
other
states
would
have
the
right
to
make
those
kinds
of
decisions.
i
can't
predict
that
if
north
dakota
did
that
and
if
it
reached
this
court
what
this
court
would
do,
but
it
may
could
and
if
it
could,
then
i
would
think
that
this
state,
alabama,
would
have
that
same
right.
assuming
that,
and
you
must
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
disfranchise
those
who
commit
moral
turpitude
crimes,
one
wonders
where
that
authority
comes
from.
it
comes
first
from
the
tenth
amendment,
that
the
state
has
the
right
and
a
wide
discretion
of
the
rights
to
set
qualifications
for
voters
and
to
determine
who
is
eligible
to
vote.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
lassiter
case,
which
was
cited
by
this
court
in
the
richardson
case,
it
states
specifically
that
previous
criminal
record
is
a
fact
the
state
may
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
someone
is
qualified
to
vote.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
kind
of
a
previous
criminal
record
which
included
a
conviction
of
a
crime
involving
a
moral
turpitude
type
crime
would
be
a
factor
that
the
state
could
take
into
account
and
should
be
able
to
take
into
account
pursuant
to
those
powers
and
duties
left
to
it
by
the
constitution.
if
the
court
is
to
say
that
per
se
a
state
does
not
have
the
right
to
disfranchise
those
who
commit
moral
turpitude
crimes
without
a
showing
that
there
is
some
other
violation
of
the
federal
constitution,
they
would
be
destroying
in
my
opinion
what
the
tenth
amendment
says
and
if
the
tenth
amendment
allows
the
states
to
control
these
types
of
matters
and
they
can
do
so,
then
the
states
should
be
allowed
to.
secondly,
this
court's
opinion
in
the
richardson
case,
as
is
well
know,
the
second
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
allows
the
state
to
disfranchise
for
participation
in
rebellion
or
other
crime.
it
affirmatively
sanctions
that
and
does
not
put
the
penalty
provision
of
the
rest
of
the
provision
on
the
state
if
disfranchisement
is
based
on
participation
of
rebellion
or
other
crime.
this
court
in
reviewing
the
legislative
history
of
section
2,
i
feel,
was
careful
to
point
out
that
there
was
little
debate
on
what
this
section
meant,
that
the
interest
of
everyone
was
on
another
provision
and
that
section
means
what
it
says,
other
crime.
therefore,
other
crime
could
include
the
conviction
of
crimes
other
than
a
felony.
i
again
turn
to
lassiter
because
the
court
in
discussing
the
eventual
holding
of
richardson
was
cited
lassiter
and
specifically
cited
the
language
from
lassiter
that
allows
the
state
to
take
into
account
in
determining
qualifications
of
voters
previous
criminal
record.
the
analysis
then
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
either,
one,
would
allow
disfranchisement
for
other
crime
and
escape
the
penalties
of
the
first
section
or
that
because
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
second
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
talks
about
other
crimes,
there
has
been
created
to
the
state
a
special
area,
a
unique
area,
if
you
will,
in
dealing
with
voting.
the
importance
of
saying
rebellion
or
other
crime
in
an
amendment
that
was
passed
to
help
protect
that
very
right,
that
is
voting,
seems
to
me
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
special
area
of
protection
for
the
states
and
if
the
court
was
not
to
accept
that
other
crime
means
all
crimes
of
any
kind,
then
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
mean
that
in
judging
a
statute
based
on
the
disfranchisement
of
crimes
other
than
a
felony,
a
lesser
standard,
a
less
strict
standard
that
is
used
in
voting
cases
on
a
general
basis
be
used;
that
a
strict
scrutiny
test
not
be
used,
but
a
rational
basis
test
be
used.
now,
there
are
some
appellate
court
decision
that
adopt
that
view.
i
could
not
find
any
decision
from
this
court
that
adopted
that
view.
we
would
urge
that
it
would
be
consistent
if
the
language
of
section
2
and
the
citation
to
cases
which
talk
about
the
states
being
able
to
decide
what
the
qualifications
are
for
voters
and
cite
a
tenth
amendment
case
that
at
least
this
area,
this
area
of
voting
has
left
a
little
more
special
special
impact,
a
little
more
uniqueness
to
the
states,
a
little
broader
latitude,
if
you
will,
in
dealing
with
these
problems.
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
apply
at
all,
but
it
would
apply
on
a
less
level
than
a
strict
scrutiny
will.
mr.
james
s.
ward
why,
your
honor?
mr.
james
s.
ward
well--
mr.
james
s.
ward
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
s.
ward
well,
the
argument,
your
honor,
would
be
the
same
if
now
the
effect
of
what
is
happening
with
section
182
is
on
a
basis
other
than
race,
is
on
a
basis
of
any
other
bad
attention.
i
do
not
see
that
as
being
a
prohibition
of
that
amendment.
mr.
james
s.
ward
i
believe
it
says
based
on
race,
does
it
not,
your
honor?
mr.
james
s.
ward
okay.
but,
there
could
be
a
discrimination
based
on
something
other
than
race
and
not
be
any
problems
with
that
amendment.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
the
difference
in
treatment
here
is
because
of
a
classification
involved
with
moral
turpitude
crimes
as
opposed
to
race,
then
the
fifteenth
amendment
would
not
apply.
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
if
it
is
shown
that
the
vote
is
abridged
because
of
race--
mr.
james
s.
ward
--do
i
agree
that
the
fifteenth
amendment--
mr.
james
s.
ward
--i
didn't
hear
the
last
part
of
your
question,
sir.
mr.
james
s.
ward
no,
sir.
mr.
james
s.
ward
well,
i
argued
it,
i
thought,
in
that
the
arguments
i
do
make...
that
is
if
there
is
a
permissible
reason
for
what
is
happening
now
with
the
section
that
would
pass
constitutional
muster
under
the
fourteenth
or
the
fifteenth.
that
because,
if
you
will,
of
what
is
happening
now
is
not
race,
it
is
something
else.
it
is
the
interest
of
the
state
in
disfranchising
those
who
are
convicted
of
moral
turpitude
crime
and,
therefore,
the
fifteenth
amendment
would
not
be
involved.
mr.
james
s.
ward
your
honor,
both
the
passage
of
time
and
changes
in
the
amendment
itself.
section
182
today
does
not
read
the
same
way
as
it
did
then.
it
reads
the
same
way,
but
there
have
been
crimes
taken
out
of
its
sphere.
therefore,
the
crimes
that
have
been
taken
out
of
its
sphere,
plus
the
passage
of
time,
yes,
sir,
would
allow
it
to
have
some
effect
to
that.
mr.
james
s.
ward
well,
my
analysis
is
i
cannot
get
up
here
and
say
race
did
not
play
a
part
in
it.
mr.
james
s.
ward
i
would
still
have
to
argue
that,
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
again,
because
of
the
passage
of
time,
that
argument
loses
some
of
its
strength.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve...
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court...
reserve
what
time
i
have
left.
mr.
james
s.
ward
no,
ma'am,
it
is
not
accurate
for
two
reasons,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
that
mailing
by...
i
can't
remember,
whatever
it
is,
was
not
even
a
crime
then.
it
became
a
crime
in
1967.
secondly,
the
argument
goes
we
weren't
trying
to
disfranchise
all
misdemeanors.
we
are
just
trying
to
disfranchise
felons
and
moral
turpitude
offenders,
misdemeanors
or
not.
so,
the
under-inclusive
argument,
to
me,
does
not
apply
and
misunderstands
what
we
are
trying
to
say.
we
aren't
trying
to
say
that
the
state
can
select
18
misdemeanors
and
not
select
18
others.
and,
the
18
they
did
not
select
were
more
serious
than
the
ones
that
they
did
not.
what
we
are
saying
is
the
threshold
question
is
conviction
of
a
felony
or
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
and
then
it
is
that,
the
moral
part
of
it
which
is
important,
not
if
the
penalty
is
one
day
or
ten
days.
and,
i
think
that
analysis
for
that
reason...
the
felonies...
if
you
were
to
say
a
statute
that
disqualifies
all
felonies,
there
are
some
of
those
which
is
some
states
are
not
serious
at
all
and
in
some
states,
of
course,
are.
i
think
some
states,
if
you
pick
some
wool
or
something,
you
can
be
sent
off
as
a
felon.
so,
the
fact
that
it
is
all
felons,
that
same
argument
could
apply
there,
that
some
felons...
or
crimes
which
are
felons
are
just
so
unserious
as
compared
to
others
it
is
an
under-inclusiveness
type
thing
there.
mr.
james
s.
ward
well,
sir,
that
was
based
on
a
finding
which
was
challenged
at
trial.
that
finding
was
based
on
statistics--
mr.
james
s.
ward
--sir?
mr.
james
s.
ward
that--
mr.
james
s.
ward
--well,
if
you
accept
that,
if
it
still
does
have
that
effect,
then
i
would
suggest
that
there
could
be
shown
that
there
are
reasons
other
than
the
selection
of
the
crime
that
causes
the
effect.
mr.
james
s.
ward
purpose.
mr.
james
s.
ward
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
s.
ward
your
honor,
if
it
was
passed
again
in
the
same
manner,
if
this
court
strikes
it
down
and
it
is
passed
again
in
the
same
manner
and
it
shows
it
still
impacts
against
blacks,
then
proof
would
have
to
be
adduced
as
to
why
and
i
think
some
things
could
be
shown
as
to
perhaps
why.
but,
that--
mr.
james
s.
ward
--i
don't
believe
it
is,
no,
sir.
mr.
james
s.
ward
if
the
state
would
have
the
right
to
disfranchise
those
who
commit
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude
and
that
is
the
reason
why
there
is
an
impact,
then,
yes,
you
could.
--thank
you.
mr.
james
s.
ward
justice
stevens,
i
have
the
citation
to
that
case
if
you
would
like
it,
sir,
to
the
state
decision
that
defines
this
offense
as
one
involving
moral
turpitude.
mr.
james
s.
ward
if
you
would
like
it,
i
have
it.
it
is
irwin
versus
the
state,
203
southern
second,
283.
mr.
james
s.
ward
yes,
sir.
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i...
thank
you.
