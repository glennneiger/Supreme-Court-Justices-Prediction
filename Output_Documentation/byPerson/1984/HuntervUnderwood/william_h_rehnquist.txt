mr.
still,
just
how
much
evidence
do
you
think
a
plaintiff
has
to
have
to
make
the
sort
of
showing
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
you
have
made
here?
you
say
that
the
proponent
stated,
this
was
his
motive,
he
wanted
to
disinfranchise
blacks.
now,
you
know,
i
don't
know
how
many
people
there
were
in
the
constitutional
convention,
but
how
much
showing
do
you
have
to
have
as
to
the
motivation,
say,
of
at
least
a
majority
of
the
people
who
voted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
that
is
probably
true
but
that
wasn't
the
question
i
asked
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
wouldn't
offer
any
more
general
test
than
just
whatever
the
test
is
of
this
passage
which
is
certainly
a
permissible
point
of
view.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
can
you
be
sure
without
the
sort
of
evidence
of
actual
discriminatory
intent
that
you
adduce
on
the
part
of
the
sponsor
that
it
is
necessarily
a
pretext?
supposing
they
had
a
lot
of
people
getting
up
on
the
convention
floor
and
saying
i
realize
the
sponsor
says
this
is
to
disinfranchise
blacks.
i
don't
want
to
disinfranchise
blacks
but
i
will
regretfully
go
along
with
this
because
i
think
it
is
a
sound
principle
to
disinfranchise
these
kinds
of
misdemeanors.
