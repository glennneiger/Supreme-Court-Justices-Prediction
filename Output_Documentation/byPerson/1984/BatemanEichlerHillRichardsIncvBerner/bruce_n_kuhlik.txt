mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
focus
on
what
the
commission
believes
is
the
dispositive
factor
in
this
litigation,
and
that
is
the
furtherance
of
the
public
interest
in
deterring
violations
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
we
think
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
allowing
this
lawsuit
to
go
forward
in
the
circumstances
as
we
now
believe
them
to
be
will
further,
will
best
further
the
deterrence
of
violations
of
section
10
(b)
and
rule
10
(b)(5).
now,
deterrence
of
wrongdoing
is
an
important
component
of
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
as
it
has
developed
at
common
law.
the
courts
engaged
in
a
flexible
balancing
of
relative
fault
in
order
to
determine
which
party
was
the
primary
wrongdoer
who
should
be
deterred
in
the
first
instance,
and
we
think
that
in
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
presented
in
this
case
where
private
actions
such
as
those
under
rule
10(b),
or
excuse
me,
rule
10(b)(5),
makes
an
important
contribution
to
enforcement
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
we
think
that
the
court's
decision
in
perma
life
mufflers
which
held
the
defense
unavailable
in
a
private
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
because
the
defense
would
not
further
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
sherman
and
clayton
act,
we
think
that
that
case
requires
that
the
defense
be
applied
here
only
if
it
will
further
the
purposes
of
the
securities
laws.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
the
deterrence
of
wrongdoing
by
brokerage
professionals
and
insiders.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
that
allowing
the
lawsuit
to
go
forward
will
deter
brokerage
sales
people
such
as
mr.
lazzaro
here
from
perpetrating
frauds
on
their
clients.
that
is
the
whole
purpose
of
the
action
to
be
implied.
and
the
only
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not
there
is
some
other
overriding
factor
on
the
other
side
in
terms
of
perhaps
encouraging
wrongdoing
by
persons
in
the
position
of
the
plaintiffs
that
would,
as
i
say,
override
this
deterrent
impact
on
the
brokers.
and
we
think
that
that
overriding
factor
on
the
other
side
just
isn't
present.
in
the
commission's
view,
allowing
this
action
to
go
forward
will
not
unduly
encourage
illegal
tippee
trading.
in
the
first
place,
allowing
the
suit
to
go
forward
will
deter
brokers
from
giving
information
in
the
first
place.
it
will
cut
that
inside
information
off
at
the
source.
it
won't
be
there
for
the
tippees
to
trade
on.
in
the
second
place,
investors
in
the
position
of
the
plaintiffs,
in
the
commission's
view,
are
often
unsophisticated,
certainly
as
compared
with
the
brokerage
professionals
here,
it
might
be
believed
that
they
were
unsophisticated,
unschooled
in
the
law,
and
we
think
that
for
that
reason
the
brokerage
professionals
are
far
more
likely
to
respond
to
the
deterrent
impact
of
not
allowing
the
defense
here
than
ordinary
investors
would
be
to
the
deterrent
impact
on
their
trading
of
allowing
the
defense.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
on
whose
part?
on
the--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--if
all
of
the
information
was
truthful--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--then
i
do
not
believe
they
could
recover
because
they
would
not
have
been
deceived.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
think
when
tippees
consider
whether
to
trade
on
inside
information,
they
do
not
consider
seriously
the
possibility
of
recovery
in
court
if
the
information
turns
out
to
be
false.
they
trade
on
tips
from
trusted
friends,
from
their
broker,
and
they
will
go
ahead
and
trade
on
it
if
they
believe
it.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
person
would
trade,
invest
substantial
sums
of
money
on
information
believing
there
to
be
a
substantial
possibility
that
the
whole
information
is
false,
simply
on
the
chance,
just
the
chance
that
they
might
recover
later
in
a
legal
action.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
no,
justice
white,
i
believe--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--my
position
is
that
the
enforcement
of
the
securities
laws
is
so
important
that
the
defense
should
only
be
allowed
where
it
will
further
the
purposes
of
the
securities
laws,
even
if
in
a
particular
case
the
fault
of
the
parties
were
relatively
equal.
but
i
might
add
that,
you
know,
i
will
get
to
this.
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
even
a
close
case
as
to
equal
fault.
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
insider
and
the
brokerage
professional
here
were
of
greater
fault--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--because
they
abused
their
special
position
in
the
scheme
of
the
capital
market
system
and
in
the
scheme
of
the
enforcement
of
the
securities
laws
to
perpetrate
a
fraud
on
the
investors.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
it
is
true
that
if--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--under
the
securities
laws,
justice
white,
if
a
plaintiff
could
prove
that
the
investors
here
traded
on
inside
information
knowing
that
information
or
being
on
notice
that
that
information
was
received
in
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty
of
an
insider
and
that
that
caused
a
trading
loss
to
some
other
group
of
investors,
then
they
would
be
liable,
but--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--i
believe
it
is,
and
that
the--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--because,
well,
of
a
number
of
factors.
because
of
their
special
position,
but
also
because
they
are
the
people
who
instigated
the
fraud
here
they
are
the
people
who
took
advantage
of
the
plaintiff
investors,
engaged
them
in
a
scheme,
abused
their
position
of
trust
to
make
them
believe
that
they
were
trading
on
inside
information
when
in
fact
it
was
the
plaintiffs
all
along
who
were
the
intended
victims,
excuse
me,
and
the
actual
victims
of
the
fraud,
and
in
this
regard,
i
might
add
that
the
brokers
and
insiders
such
as
those
here,
in
the
commission's
view,
have
a
much
greater
opportunity
to
jeopardize
the
integrity
of
the
market
systems.
they
are
continually
in
a
position
to
come
into
inside
information,
to
represent
or
to
misrepresent
to
their
clients,
to
their
friends,
to
their
investors
that
they
have
access
to
this
sort
of
information.
and
the
brokerage
professionals
such
as
lazzaro
here
occupy
a
key
position.
they
control
access
to
these
markets.
if
a
plaintiff
wants
to
trade,
he
has
to
do
it
through
a
broker,
and
it
is
up
to
the
brokers
to
be...
they
are
required
to
be
conversant
with
the
law,
to
be
conversant
with
commission
rules,
regulations
and
the
statute,
and
it
is
up
to
them
in
the
first
instance
to
guide
the
trading
of
their
clients
into
lawful
channels.
and
that
position
of
trust
was
abused
here.
and
if
the
commission
is
to
be
able
to
uncover
these
sorts
of
frauds
perpetrated
on
investors,
the
only
realistic
way
for
most
of
these
frauds
to
come
to
light
is
through
private
actions
such
as
these,
and
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
investors
would
have
little
incentive
indeed
to
bring
these
sorts
of
actions
to
light
because
by
doing
so,
they
expose
themselves
to
possible
criminal
and
civil
sanctions.
so
without
the
incentive
of
recovering
their
investment,
it
is
most,
most
unlikely
that
these
sorts
of
frauds
would
be
uncovered.
and
finally,
we
would
note
in
regard
to
the
position
of
the
parties
here,
that
in
the
commission's
view,
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
should
be
available
in
those
securities
actions
where
the
plaintiffs,
perhaps
the
investors,
have
instigated
an
illegal
scheme,
are
truly
involved
in
a
conspiracy
with
a
broker
for
their
mutual
benefit.
but
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
that
is
why
i
would
like
to
turn
then
to
the
comparative
fault
of
the
parties.
the
petitioner
claims
that
under
the
common
law,
a
plaintiff
who
is
guilty
of
fraud
is
barred
from
recovering
under
the
in
pari
delicto
doctrine
under
all
circumstances.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
if
all
of
the
information
is
false,
justice
white,
i
don't
believe
that
the
other
parties
to
the
trade
would
have
an
action.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
but
he...
there
was
nothing
that
he
used
that
he
should
have
disclosed
to
them
that--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--caused
them
the
loss
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
well,
he
might
not
be,
although
i
believe--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--well,
some
of
the
cases,
justice
white,
speak
in
terms
of
moral
blame--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--he
would
not
be
in
delicto,
he
would
not
have
violated--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--i
might
have
misspoken,
justice
white.
in
our
view,
if
all
of
the
information
were
false,
then
another
party
to
a
trade
wouldn't
have
had
a
private
action
against
the
investors
here,
but
the
commission
most
certainly
would
have.
if
the
commission
could
have
proved
that
the
investors
believed
the
information
to
be
true,
they
believed
it
to
be
inside
information
that
they
had
obtained
in
breach
of
an
insider's
duty,
or
they
had
notice
of
such
a
breach,
the
commision
most
certainly
could
bring
an
action,
civil
or
criminal
action
for
an
attempted
violation
of
the
law.
so
in
that
respect,
even
if
all
of
the
information
is
false,
it
may
well
be
that
the
investors
here
have
attempted
to
violate
the
law.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
at
this
posture
of
the
case,
we
don't
believe
the
complaint
conclusively
shows
that.
under
the
common
law,
it
was
not
enough
simply,
or
it
is
not
enough
now,
as
the
common
law
has
developed,
that
the
plaintiff
simply
has
engaged
in
a
fraud.
a
more
refined
balancing
takes
place
that
takes
into
account
the
deterrent
purposes
of
the
law
and
the
actual
degree
of
wrongdoing.
and
we
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
our
briefs
where,
for
example,
a
plaintiff
who
believed
he
was
defrauding
others
by
engaging
in
a
fixed
foot
race
was
allowed
to
recover,
notwithstanding
the
in
pari
delicto
doctrine,
from
the
parties
who
had
defrauded
him,
because
the
race
in
fact
was
fixed
against
him.
finally,
i
would
note
that
we
believe
it
makes
little
sense
to
adopt
a
rule
that
would
distinguish
solely
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
investors
had
noticed
that
the
information
they
were
trading
on
was
inside
or
indeed
was
information
obtained
in
breach
of
an
insider's
duty
because
we
wouldn't
want
to
allow
brokers
to
escape
liability
simply
by
couching
their
tips
in
terms
of
inside
information.
if
there
is
nothing
further--
