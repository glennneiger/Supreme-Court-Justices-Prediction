we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
bateman
eichler
against
berner.
mr.
warren,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
was
that
a
violation
of
the
securities
laws?
chief
justice
burger
and
you
suggest
that
was
a
signal
that
in
effect
was
a
violation
of
the
act?
chief
justice
burger
if
this
stock
had
gone
to
28
and
then
this
fellow
had
sold
it
and
made
a
very
large
profit,
would
it
be
subject
to
some
vulnerability
on
the
part
of
others?
chief
justice
burger
now,
as
i
read
the
district
judge,
he
said
he
wasn't
going
to
get
into
a
fine
tuned
weighing
of
quantitative
dishonesty,
quantitative
fraud,
quantitative
violations
of
the
securities
act,
that
he
was
going
to
weigh
and
did
weigh
what
he
thought
was
the
qualitative
violations,
and
he
thought
qualitatively
they
were
in
the
same
boat.
isn't
that
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
knudsen?
chief
justice
burger
well,
would
that
make
it
any
less
a
violation
of
10(b)(5)?
chief
justice
burger
that
he
was...
the
narrowness
of,
the
scope
of
the
fraud.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
agree
with
your
friend's
response
when
i
put
to
him
this
question,
that
if
this
stock
had
gone
up
to
28
and
then
this
gentleman
sold
out
at
28,
would
you
be
subject
to
a
claim
for
recovery
from
them,
and
then
after
that
it
dropped
to
where
it
did
drop,
1
or
less?
would
the
purchasers
of
that
stock
have
been
able
to
recover
from
this
fellow?
chief
justice
burger
i
take
it
you
concede
there
was
market
manipulation
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kuhlik?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
