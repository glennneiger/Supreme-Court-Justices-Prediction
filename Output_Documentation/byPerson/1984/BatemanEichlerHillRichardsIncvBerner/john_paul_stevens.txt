justice
stevens
mr.
warren,
can
i
interrupt
with
one
question?
justice
stevens
i
guess
one
of
the
problems
is
what
really
is
equal
fault
in
cases
of
this
kind,
and
if
i
understand
your
colloquy
with
justice
white,
you
say
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
tipster
was
telling
the
truth
or
not;
in
either
event
it
is
equally
bad.
justice
stevens
is
that...
in
other
words,
supposing
you
had
a
case
in
which
a
tipster...
a
broker
says
to
a
customer,
i
just
talked
to
the
president
of
the
company
and
they
are
about
to
buy
a
gold
mine,
and
in
one
case
that
is
just
no
basis
in
fact
for
it;
in
the
other
case
it's
totally
true.
would
you...
and
the
customer
then
goes
out
and
buys
100
shares
of
stock.
would
you
say
in
neither
case
could
the
customer
recover?
justice
stevens
well,
no,
not
because...
at
the
time
he
tells
him,
it
is
true,
but
then
a
month
later
the
deal
falls
apart.
you
know,
that
is...
arguably
that
might
have
happened
here.
i
don't
know.
justice
stevens
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
transaction,
though,
everybody
was
dealing
in
at
least
not
a
false
way.
you
say
there
is
no
difference
between
the
case
where
he
tells
the
truth
and
the
one
where
the
broker
lies.
justice
stevens
well,
there
is
intent
in
both
case
to
trade
on
inside
information.
in
the
one
case
it
is
false
inside
information;
in
the
second
case
it's
true.
justice
stevens
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
could
make
a
stronger
argument
that
when
everybody
thought
it
was
true
but
they
just
thought
they
would
make
a
little
money
on
the
side,
that
you
would
say
they
are
equally
guilty,
but
it
is
a
little
different
if
he...
i
just...
if
one
of
them
is
lying
and
the
other
one
didn't
realize
it.
justice
stevens
but
there
would
be...
isn't
it
a
violation
of
the
securities
law
to
give
inside
information
in
that
situation?
justice
stevens
well,
why
not?
if
he
acts
on
illegally
acquired
information,
the
stock
instead
of
going
up
goes
down,
why
hasn't
he
been
injured?
justice
stevens
so
you
are
saying
that
the
broker
who
gives
inside
information,
truthful
inside
information
to
a
customer,
does
not
violate
the
statute?
justice
stevens
well,
i
don't
understand
your
as
to.
there
is
or
is
not
a
violation.
if
the
sec
could
call
it
a
violation,
there's
a
violation
of
the
rules.
justice
stevens
that
may
be
the
reason
why,
but
i
still
say
there
is
a
violation,
as
i
understand
the
law,
and
it
conceivably,
it
could
cause
an
injury
to
the
person
who
acts
on
the
basis
of
the
information.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
that
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
you
say
if
they
had
been
smart
enough
to
sell
out
before
it
dropped,
they
would
be
liable
to
other
parties
if
part
of
the
information
was
truthful.
at
least
they
thought
it
was
truthful
when
they
were
relying
on
the
inside
information,
didn't
they?
that's
why
they
bought
it.
justice
stevens
now,
why
isn't
that
a
violation?
why
wouldn't
they
be
liable
to
the
people
to
whom--
justice
stevens
--what
difference
does
it
make?
they
thought
it
was
true
at
the
time
they
engaged
in
the
trades,
didn't
they?
that's
the
whole
hypothesis
of
the
fraud.
so
how
can
their
blameworthiness
depend
on
whether
the
information
turns
out
to
be
true
or
false?
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
well,
it
may
have
as
long
as
people
think
the
information
is
true.
this
talk
about
this
gold
mine
over
wherever
this
place
was--
justice
stevens
--they
sell
out
when...
you
say
they
wanted
to,
and
they
were
talked
out
of
selling
out.
they
just--
--the
market
goes
up
on
the
basis
of
public
perception,
not
reality.
justice
stevens
isn't
it
almost
certainly
true
that
some
of
the
information
is
going
to
be
true?
you
are
not
going
to
assume
the
burden
of
proving
every
single
statement
alleged
in
there
was
false,
are
you?
i
mean,
in
these
facts,
there
is
always
a
mixture
of
truth,
even
in
the
most
gross
fraud.
do
you
assume
that
you
have
to
prove
that
every
statement
in
the
complaint
was
false?
justice
stevens
and
the
scheme
involved
a
mixture
of--
justice
stevens
--half
truths
and
truths
and
falsehoods.
justice
stevens
well,
i
just
have
difficulty
understanding
how
your...
whether
your
client
was
engaged
in
wrongdoing
turns
out...
depends
on
whether
he
finds
out
later
that
the
information
was
false
or
not.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question?
justice
stevens
then
i
will
get
it
all
off
my
chest.
supposing
your
theory...
i
realize
you
are
relying
on
a
fraud
theory,
but
supposing
you
had
a
case
in
which
a
plaintiff
just
said
he
got
inside
information
which
he
relied
on
and
was
true
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
but
the
stock
didn't...
the
deal
fell
through
and
the
stock
didn't
go
up
as
much
as
he
expected
it.
do
you
think
the
plaintiff
has
a
cause
of
action
there?
your
opponent
says
no,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
absent
fraud.
justice
stevens
he
would
know
he
is
deal...
he
is
passing
out
inside
information,
he
knows
he
has
a
duty
not
to
do
so.
the
customer,
the
broker,
knows
it
is
inside
information,
knows
the
law
says
you
are
not
supposed
to
do
this,
you
say
there
is
no
scienter?
that's
the
answer?
justice
stevens
everybody
is
telling
the
truth.
this
is
my
hypothesis.
justice
stevens
the
broker
says
they
just
found
a
gold
mine,
they
are
going
to
make
a
billion
dollar
deal,
it
is
a
good
buy,
it
is
inside
information,
don't
tell
anybody.
justice
stevens
you
trade
on
it,
and
the
stock
goes
up
for
a
while,
but
then
the
deal
falls
through,
but
everybody
is
dealing
on
inside
information.
does
the
customer
of
the
stock
broker
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
stock
broker
for
dealing
in
inside
information?
justice
stevens
so
what
it
boils
down,
it
is
all
right
to
trade
on
inside
information
as
long
as
it
is
true.
justice
stevens
what
it
boils
down
to
is
it
is
all
right
to
trade
on
inside
information
as
long
as
it
is
true.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
justice
stevens
assuming
after
trial
there
is
a
findings
that
everything
everybody
said
was
entirely
truthful;
is
there
liability
or
not?
justice
stevens
well,
does
the
plaintiff
recover
from
the
defendant
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
it's
all
inside
information,
but
it
was
truthful.
justice
stevens
all
right.
