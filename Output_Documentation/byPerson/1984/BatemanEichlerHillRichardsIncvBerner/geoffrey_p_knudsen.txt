mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
an
insider
trading
case.
it
is
a
case
in
which
the
complaint
alleged
a
common,
garden
variety
fraud,
and
the
fraud
was
perpetrated
on
the
plaintiffs.
the
fraud
was,
as
the
complaint
alleges
was
a
planned...
a
plan
conceived
by
the
defendants
to
manipulate
the
price
of
stock
in
tonm,
not
for
the
benefit
of
all,
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendants
alone.
as
part
of
the
scheme,
the
defendants--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--pardon
me?
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
well,
the
scope
of
the
fraud,
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
would
have
some
effect
in
terms
of
interpreting
whether
the
plaintiffs
could
be
considered
to
be
of
equal
fault
or
in
pari
delicto,
but
the
complaint
itself
is
meant
to
alleged
a...
just
a
fraud
10(b)(5)
violation
in
the
context
of
a
market
manipulation,
and
that
the
plaintiffs
were
injured
by
it.
what
makes
it
a
little
bit
different
is
that
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
plaintiffs,
who
ended
up
losing
their
money,
were
utilized
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
defendants'
fraud.
in
other
words,
it
was
the
intent
of
the
defendants
to
provide
intentionally
false
information
alleged
to
be
inside
to
the
plaintiffs.
they
initiated
the
contact,
they
did
it
for
purposes
of
having
the
plaintiffs
trade,
driving
the
price
of
the
stock
up.
they
never
intended
the
plaintiffs
to
benefit
from
that
market
manipulation,
and
in
fact,
as
the
complaint
alleges,
when
the
plaintiffs
indicated
some
desire
to
sell
when
the
stock
got
up
at
its
higher
levels,
they
continued
the
fraud
so
that
they
would
continue
to
hold
on
to
their
stock
by
saying,
wait,
it
will
go
higher,
it
will
go
higher.
so
it
is
not
a
situation
where
the
defendants
and
the
plaintiffs
embarked
upon
a
conspiracy
to
somehow
utilize
inside
information.
it
is
solely
a
situation
where
the
defendants
are
alleged
to
have
embarked
upon
scheme
to
defraud
the
market
and
defraud
these
plaintiffs.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
because
the
allegations
are
that
the
information
was
false,
there
would
be
no
liability.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
no
one
was
injured.
there's
nothing...
he
wouldn't
have
a
duty
to
disclose
false
information,
particularly
in
the
context
of--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--i
think
you
need
to
read
the
complaint
as
alleging
everything
is
false.
that's
what
the
charging
allegation
is--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--well,
i
don't
think
you
can
look
at
the
face
of
the
complaint
and
then
conclude
that
the
allegations
are
part
false
and
part
true.
the
central
allegation
of
the
complaint
is
paragraph
16,
that
the
defendants
were
engaged
in--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--okay.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
would
he
have
liability?
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
to
the
extent
that
there
was
damage
to
such
a
person--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--related
to
the
true
information.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
if
he
received
true
information.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
right.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
to
the
extent
that
he
receives
true
information,
he
would
be
delicto,
in
delicto.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
that's
right--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--okay,
and
in
terms
of
deciding
in
pari
delicto,
then
if
you
are
trying
to
decide
it
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
assuming
that
you
read
the
complaint
that
some
is
true
and
some
is
false,
the
complaint
in
my
opinion
would
be
a
very
bad
device
to
make
that
determination
of
in
pari
delicto.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
well,
it
was
made
by
the
district--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--it
was
made
by
the
district
court,
and
that
was
my
argument
in
the
9th
circuit,
that
it
would
be
a
bad
device
to
use.
but
the
9th
circuit
read
the
complaint
as
charging
an
intentional
fraud,
all
of
the
information
false.
that's
actually
what
the
9th
circuit
concluded,
was
that--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--i
don't
think
that
they
decided
the
issue
of
whether
it
is
inside
information
in
the
context
of
this--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--no.
i
think
that
the
9th
circuit
assumes
that
there
is
a
line...
there
was
a
line
of
authority
that
says
if
you
have
a
tippee
attempting
to
trade
on
inside
information,
that
he
may
be
guilty
of
a
violation,
but
concluded
in
the
circumstances
of
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
where
an
intentional
fraud
being
perpetrated
on
the
plaintiffs
was
alleged,
that
more
or
less
as
a
matter
of
law
those
parties
could
not
be
in
pari
delicto.
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
common
law.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
which
at
common
law,
if
you
have
an
actual
fraud
and
the
determination,
there
is
a
public
policy
issue
if
withholding
the
relief
would
do
more
to
offend
public
morals,
then
in
pari
delicto
would
not
apply,
and
that
is
the
situation
that
the
9th
circuit
addressed
and
said
if
there
is
a
fraud
aimed
at
these
plaintiffs
and
aimed
at
the
market,
then
to
withhold
relief
or
to
withhold
the
opportunity
to
pursue
their
claim
would
be
more
offensive
in
the
concept
of...
in
the
context
of
in
pari
delicto.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
i'm
into
justice
white's
problem
in
the
sense
that
if
you
read
that
there
is
some
true
inside
information
or
nonpublic
information
and
some
false,
and
the
stock
goes
to
28
based
on
an
activity
of
trading,
and
then
there
is
this
true
information
about
the
gold
find,
yes,
there
would
be
liability.
the
complaint
was
meant
to
alleged
a
market
manipulation
that
did
not
involve
true
information,
or
at
most,
partially
true
information
solely
for
purposes
of
market
manipulation.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
absolutely,
but
that
is
not
the
activity
that
my...
that
was
done
unknowingly
with
my
clients
and
the
plaintiffs
as
an
instrumentality
of
that,
and
they
were
not
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
benefit
from
that
market
manipulation,
and
in
fact,
they
lost
money,
and
that
is
why
they
have
come
forward
and
asserted
their
claims.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
i
said
they
would
if
the
information
was
true
information.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
well,
i
think
that
the
hypothetical
becomes
a
little
difficult
to
deal
with
because
if
it
is
false
information,
the
stock
doesn't
go
to
28.
that's--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--oh,
i
see,
and
they
sell
out
in
the
context
of--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--that's
absolutely
right,
and
that's
what
is
charged
by
the
complaint.
they
would
have
liability
to
the
extent
that
they
received
true
information,
and
you
are
asking
would
they
also
have
liability
to
those
folks
that
sold
their
stock
even
though
the
market
was
going
up
because
of
false
information?
and
i
would
say
no
because--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--no.
i
assume
i
have
to
prove
that
there
was
an
intentional
scheme
to
manipulate
the
market
utilizing
my
clients,
providing
them--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--essentially--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--but
essentially
false
information.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
well,
to
the
extent
my
client
is
engaged
in
wrongdoing
may
not
depend
on
that
at
all
unless
you
look
at
it
in
the
context
of
perhaps
this
court's
chiarella
and
dirks
analysis,
and
then
you
have
to
look
at
a
duty
to
disclose,
and
then
the
question
comes
up
how
can
you
have
a...
how
could
the
insider
have
a
duty
to
disclose
false
information
because
that
is
the
very
thing
you
don't
want
to
happen,
but
in
ignoring
that
distinction
recently
drawn,
yes,
i
think
the
sec's
position
would
be
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
is
true
or
false,
my
clients
are
in
delicto,
as
justice
white
said.
the
question
becomes
if
they
are
intentionally
manipulated,
are
they
in
pari
delicto.
in
terms
of
the
plaintiffs'
position,
their
position
is
there
is
no
equality
of
fault
in
those
situations
where
they
are
being
utilized
unknowingly
as
a
market
manipulator
because--
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
--sure.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
well,
i
say
he
has
no
cause
of
action
because
you
don't
have
the
degree
of
scienter
on
the
defendant
that
would
be
required
by
ernst
&
ernst
for
a
10(b)
violation,
i
agree.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
everyone
is
telling
the
truth.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
right.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
of
the
scienter
requirement
for...
because
it
is
not
an
insider...
he
doesn't
have
a
claim
for
insider
trading.
if
he
has
a
claim
against
a
broker
for
anything,
it
is
for
fraud
under
10(b)(5),
and
that
would
require
scienter,
which
would
require
some
intentionally
false
or
recklessly
false
information
imparted
to
him,
and
your
hypothetical
is
it
is
true.
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
pardon
me?
mr.
geoffrey
p.
knudsen
no,
that's
a
different
question.
the
plaintiff,
someone
trading
on
true
inside
information
is
going
to
be
liable
for
criminal
sanction.
the
sec
can
proceed
against
him,
and
anyone
selling
his
stock
who
loses,
incurs
injury,
can
proceed
against
him.
but
that
doesn't
necessarily...
that's
really
a
separate
question.
that
doesn't
necessarily
make
that
person
in
pari
delicto
with
a
person
who
intentionally
misleads
him
and
provides
him
intentionally
false
information.
you
see,
he's
not
suing...
in
that
case
you
are
not
considering
the
context
of
the
tippee
vis-a-vis
the
broker.
you
are
looking
at
the
tippee
vis-a-vis
the
regulators
or
vis-a-vis
someone
who
lost
money
to
whom
he
might
have
a
duty
to
disclose
the
correct
information.
in
any
event,
given
the
legislative
history
of
the
insider
trading
sanctions
act,
i
think
they
place
the
primary
responsibility
with
the
brokers
and
the
insiders.
i
think
this
court's
decisions
that
indicate
that
the
tippee
liability
is
derivative
indicate
that
the
person
at
the
tippee
level
is
going
to
be,
in
the
common
law
sense,
even
the
common
law
sense,
of
in
pari
delicto,
not
of
equal
fault.
and
the
facts...
thank
you.
