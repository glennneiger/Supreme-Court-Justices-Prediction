mr.
robert
s.
warren
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
whether
a
tippee
who
knowingly
receives
inside
information
in
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
intending
to
use
it
to
defraud
others,
may
in
turn
sue
his
tipper
under
section
10
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
the
case
arose
in
the
context
of
a
suit
before
the
united
states
district
court
in
san
francisco.
a
judge
schwarzer
dismissed
the
action
on
motion
on
the
basis
of
the
following
critical
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
plaintiffs
alleged
that
they
had
invested
in
a
company
known
as
tonm
that
was
engaged
in
exploration
for
gold
in
surinam.
they
said
that
they
did
so
by
obtaining
information
directly
or
indirectly
through
the
defendant
broker
of
a
number
of
matters,
but
the
following
was
the
essential
point,
and
that
was
that
there
was
a
developed
gold
find
in
surinam,
and
that
there
would
shortly
be
announced
a
joint
venture
with
a
major
mining
company
in
order
to
exploit
that
gold
find.
the
complaint
recites
that
they
were
told
that
this
was
inside
information
obtained
from
a
president
or
a
vice
president
of
tonm.
they
said
that
they
purchased
shares
of
stock
in
tonm
over
a
period
of
time
from
november
1979
until
1981
on
the
premise
that
this
was
inside
information
from
that
source.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
at
that
particular
point
there
is
a
suggestion
that
it
would
be,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
it
was
confirmed
by
what
happened
in
or
about
april
of
1980
when
they
contacted
mr.
neadeau
directly.
mr.
neadeau
was
alleged
to
be
the
president
of
tonm,
and
they
asked
mr.
neadeau
whether
this
information
that
they
had
learned
from
the
broker,
mr.
lazzaro,
was
true,
and
they
were
told
by
mr.
neadeau
as
follows:
first,
that
he
could
not
confirm
or
deny
that
information;
second,
he
told
them
why,
because
it
was
not
yet
public.
then
he
told
them
when
it
would
be
public.
he
said
you
will
have
to
wait
until
you
see
the
annual
report.
and
then
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
misunderstanding,
that
the
information
might
be
inaccurate,
he
told
them
that
mr.
lazzaro,
the
broker,
was
a
very
trustworthy
and
a
good
man.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
exactly.
i
suggest
that
the
following
is
true,
that
under
the
analysis
of
this
court
in
dirks,
that
that
conduct,
their
subsequent
trading
with
that
information,
that
inside
information,
was
in
fact
a
violation
of
section
10
of
the
act,
for
the
following
reasons.
the
duty
in
question
is
derivative
from
mr.
neadeau.
mr.
neadeau
is
the
person
with
the
fiduciary
responsibility.
as
president
of
that
company
he
had
a
fiduciary
responsibility
to
his
stockholders
not
to
selectively
tell
a
broker
and
that
broker's
customers
so
that
that
broker's
customers
could
trade,
that
broker
could
earn
commissions,
that
broker's
own
stock
could
be
benefitted...
and
these
parties
were
told
about
the
stock
of
mr.
lazzaro
and
his
family.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
the
tippee
here,
justice
o'connor,
is
liable
both
directly
from
mr.
neadeau,
through
the
contact
with
mr.
neadeau,
and
derivatively
by
virtue
of
being,
if
you
will,
a
subtippee
from
mr.
lazzaro,
knowing
of
mr.
neadeau's
involvement
or
of
some
counterpart
of
mr.
neadeau.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
exactly
we
do.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
that
is
correct.
all
we
know
is--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--it
could
have
been.
however,
what
we
know
is
that
the
belief--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--that
could
be
true.
it--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--not
on
the
basis
of
what
the
facts
are
as
the
plaintiffs
assumed
them
to
be.
and
that's
what
we
must
look
at
in
deciding
whether
they
either
committed
or
attempted
to
commit
a
violation
of
section
10.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
first,
the
plaintiffs
allege,
and
they
allege
this
as
a
charging
allegation,
so
it
is
assumed
that
this
was
an
important
statement
to
them
and
one
that
they
deemed
important
in
determining
to
go
upon
this
acquisition
program
of
stock...
they
said
they
told
mr.
neadeau
that
they
were
dealing
with
mr.
lazzaro
and
that
they
wanted
to
confirm
certain
information,
and
they
said
in
the
complaint
that
what
they
wanted
to
confirm
was
the
gold
strike
in
surinam
and
the
prospective
joint
venture
with
st.
joe's.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
the
complaint
alleges
a
statement
by
mr.
neadeau
that
the
plaintiffs
allege
misled
them
into
believing
that
they
had
inside
information
and
a
jump
on
every
other
tonm
shareholder
in
that
he
made
a
statement
to
them
that
they
allege
in
their
complaint...
it
must
be
to
make
it
a
charging
allegation...
was
a
clever
confirmation
while
nonconfirming.
they
said
that
he
said
yes,
that
he
couldn't
confirm
or
deny,
but
the
realities
were
that
when
he
said
the
reason
he
couldn't
confirm
or
deny
was
because
the
information
was
not
yet
public,
they
would
have
to
wait
for
that
annual
report
to
see
that,
but
he
did
want
to
tell
them
that
mr.
lazzaro
was
a
very
trustworthy
and
good
man.
there
is
only
one
inference
from
that,
and
if
that
is
not...
if
that
is
not
an
improper
transmission
by
mr.
neadeau,
then
in
the
brokerage
industry
i
believe
they
are
going
to
talk
about
somebody
being
neadeaulized
because
that
is
nothing
more
than
a
ploy,
at
least
as
they
allege
it,
that's
their
charge,
a
ploy
to
indicate
that
they
had
inside
information,
an
unfair
jump
on
the
tonm
shareholders.
and
they
say
that
they
acted
on
it.
they
say
in
reliance
on
it,
on
the
premise
that
they
had
inside
information,
they
bought
from
other
shareholders,
and
they
bought
at
two,
they
bought
with
an
advance
knowledge
of
market
conditions,
and
they
did
in
fact
watch
the
stock
over
a
period
of
time
from
november
of
1979
up
to
the
first
quarter
of
1981,
and
indeed,
in
the
last
quarter
of
1980,
hit
a
high
water
mark
of
seven.
so
based
upon
the
information,
the
jumps
that
they
thought
they
had,
they
did
indeed
have
a
jump.
they
rode
that
stock
from
approximately
two
up
to
seven,
and
had
they
sold
at
that
point,
they
would
have
actually
achieved
the
results
of
their
contemplated
fraud.
they
didn't;
they
held.
the
stock
did
not
pan
out.
a
public
announcement
was
made
contrary
to
the
inside
information
announcing
that
the
joint
venture
wouldn't
go
through;
the
stock
went
down.
so
it
is
our
position
that
on
those
facts,
as
disclosed
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
that
plaintiffs
were
guilty
of
a
10(b)(5)
violation.
now,
it
is
understood
that--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--i
believe
that
if
the
tippee,
as
here,
is
put
in
the
position
to
understand
that
the
information
was
received
from
a
corporate
insider
with
a
fiduciary
duty
not
to
disclose
it
selectively,
and
as
here,
they
know
that
it
has
been
disclosed
selectively
for
the
purpose
of
causing
the
customers
of
a
certain
broker
to
enjoy
an
unfair
advantage,
yes.
if
all
they
are
told
is
we
have
some
inside
information,
i
think
one
can
say
at
that
point
you
don't
know
enough
to
know
whether
a
dirks
duty
has
in
fact
been
breached
or
has
not.
here
we
do.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
yes.
when
the
conduct
which
is
the
equal
fault
is
itself
fraud.
in
other
words,
obviously
if
we
have
a
gambling
game
where
someone
has
gambled,
and
that
is
their
fault,
they
have
gambled
against
the
state
law
and
they
are
cheated
with
marked
cards,
then
you
don't
have
equal
fault
because
one
person
has
a
fraudulent
intent
and
the
other
person
just
intends
to
gamble,
a
small
matter.
here,
these
people
are
alleged
to
have
had
the
identical
intent.
here
it
is
alleged
that
mr.
neadeau
and
mr.
lazzaro
intended
to
commit
a
10(b)(5)
violation.
they
intended
to
defraud
the
market.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
s.
warren
they
allege
that
the
defendants
were
engaged
in
what
they
call
manipulation
of
the
market.
at
one
point
they
had
a
section
9
claim
as
well,
but
that
was
dismissed
by
virtue
of
nontimely
filing.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
not
a
meaningful
difference,
in
our
view,
because
they
each
intended
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
as
we
read
them
to
commit
a
fraud
on
stockholders.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
the
tippees?
mr.
robert
s.
warren
oh,
the
tipster
to
use
in
side
information.
well,
they
allege
that
the
inside
information
is
not
true,
that
the
tipster
was
passing
a
wrong
that
information.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
and
says,
i
believe,
the
dirks...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
well,
i
don't...
i
suggest
that
the
difference
between
an
actionable
misrepresentation
under
10(b)(5)
and
an
actionable
nondisclosure
such
as
under
affiliated
ute
under
10(b)(5)
are
indistinguishable.
obviously--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--the
tipster
might
be
stuck
under
state
law
for
defrauding
somebody,
of
course.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
oh,
i...
perhaps
i
am
unduly
influence
by
the
fact
that
i
am
from
the
state
of
california,
but
i
don't
think
that
could
be--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--i
don't
think
that
could
be
said
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
well,
we
have,
yes,
we
have
a...
yes,
we
are
a
code
state.
however,
we
have
a
well
developed
case
law
in
california,
and
we
have
duties
of
when
it
is
necessary
to
disclose
in
order
not
to
commit
fraud,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
has
drawn
upon
common
law
concepts
as
to
those
duties
to
disclose.
in
dirks,
when
we
talk
about
there
being
fiduciary
duties--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--no,
but
if
he,
if
he
had
gone
to
a
corporate
insider
with
a
fiduciary
duty
to
that
shareholder
that
he
is
going
to
go
buy
it
from--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--and
he
gets
told
something
by
that
corporate
insider
that
is
not
to
be
revealed
and
is
a
breach
of
duty
to
do
so,
and
he
then
goes
and
buys
that
stock
and
he
doesn't
disclose,
yes,
i
believe
indeed
he
is
guilty
of
actual
fraud.
i
believe
he
is
guilty
of
actual
fraud
under
common
law,
under
state
law,
and
under
the
federal
securities
laws.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
would
the
plaintiffs
here
be
subject
to
vulnerability
to
a
suit
by
others?
yes,
indeed,
i
believe
so.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
that
is
correct.
i
believe
that
is
exactly
the
fact,
that
the
dollars
weren't
as
important
as
the
offense
which
was
committed
and
the
state
of
mind
with
which
it
was
committed.
now,
we
believe
that
if
we
are
correct
that
there
indeed
was
a
fraud
and
attempted
fraud
committed
by
the
plaintiffs
then
they
should
be
barred
because,
first,
the
defense
of
in
pari
delicto
is
a
part
of
the
statutory
law
of
the
securities
laws;
second,
it
is
based
upon
rational,
reasonable
and
publicly
accepted
considerations;
and
third,
the
government
here
has
failed
in
any
respect
to
show
that
its
enforcement
will
inhibit
the
enforcement
of
the
securities
laws.
first,
as
to
the
legislative
point,
rule
10
is
based
upon
the
statutory
section
10
which
simply
prohibits
manipulative
and
deceptive
practices.
as
such,
if
construed
to
have
a
private
remedy,
it
is
a
very
general,
federal
tort
standard
with
the
contours
to
be
set
by
the
court.
in
briscoe
v.
lahue,
however
it
is
correctly
pronounced,
it
was
said
that
when
congress
passes
such
a
very
general
federal
tort
even
for
very
good
and
important
purposes
such
as
the
civil
rights
statutes,
it
is
presumed
to
be
aware
of
the
common
law
land
the
existing
of
common
law
defenses
and
to
accept
them
into
that
tort
structure.
this
is
particularly
appropriate
with
regard
to
section
10
because
of
the
savings
clauses
that
are
found
in
section
16
of
the
'33
act
and
28
of
the
'34
act
which
accept
common
law
remedies
and
deem
them
to
continue
in
effect.
the
federal
courts
uniformly,
in
applying
section
10,
have
adopted
common
law
defenses
based
upon
the
conduct
of
plaintiffs,
for
example,
laches,
waiver,
estoppel,
ratification,
consent,
limitations,
all
of
those
based
upon
conduct
by
the
plaintiffs
have
been
accepted.
one
of
them
has
been
in
pari
delicto.
the
federal
courts
have
applied
in
pari
delicto
in
securities
actions,
and
indeed,
in
the
kuehnert
case
in
1969,
applied
it
to
an
action
much
like
that
here,
also
involving
the
tipper/tippee
type
of
situation.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
yes--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--i
would
say
in
neither
case
could
the
customer
recover,
and
if
it
is
true,
of
course,
as
pointed
out
in
kuehnert
and
pointed
out
in
tarasi,
it
is
likely
that
there
will
be
no
need
to
worry
about
the
problem
because
all
concerned
will
be
wealthy.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
there's
that
possibility.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
oh,
well,
in
the
former
case,
we
also
will
leave
out
now
the
wealthy
because
it
didn't
pan
out.
however,
because
we
have
no
bad
intent
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
we
can
also
forget
about
it
because
there
is
no
cause
of
action.
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
assumes
that
there
is
fault
on
each
side.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
i
understand,
justice
stevens,
but
i
don't
think,
still,
in
your
first
postulate,
there
would
be
any
cause
of
action
at
all
because
the
two
parties
may
have
engaged
in
inside
trading,
but
there
would
be
no
relationship
between
the
inside
trading
and
the
loss.
in
other
words,
the
party
who
received
the
tip
would
not
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
party
who
gave
the
tip
because
of
the
concept
of
inside
trading,
there
would
be
no
deception.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
perhaps
insofar
as
the
sec
is
concerned,
but
not
insofar
as
a
private
right
of
action
is
concerned.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
because
there's
no
deception,
there's
been
no
violation
as
to
him.
the
violation
occurs
in
the
inside
information
case
as
to
the
party
who
doesn't
know
about
it.
it's
the
superior
knowledge
improperly
obtained
that
makes
the
violation.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
not
to
the
customer.
he
may
indeed
to
the
stockholders
from
whom
the
customer
buys
the
stock
and
with
whom
the
customer
deals,
but
no,
a
broker
who
gives
inside
information,
true
inside
information
to
a
customer
and
is
truthful
as
between
that
customer
there
is
no
violation
as
to
that
customer,
there
is
no
tort.
there
is
no
violation.
there
will
be
a
violation
as
far
as
the
sec
is
concerned
because
that
customer
then
goes
out
and
commits
a
fraud
upon
the
third
party,
but
the
customer
has
no
claim
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
but
they
call
it
a
violation
not
because
the
broker
did
something
bad
to
the
customer--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--but
the
person
against
whom
the
violation
is
perpetrated
is
not
the
customer,
it
is
the
stockholder
out
there,
and
yet
under
your
postulate,
you
are
having
the
customer
come
in
and
sue,
and
it
is
not
the
customer
who
has
been
misled
under
those
circumstances.
the
customer
has
been
told
the
truth.
and
if
the
customer
has
been
told
the
truth,
the
customer
has
no
claim.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
all
right.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
they
do,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
no.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
he
has
not
been
wronged.
he
has
not
been
deceived.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
he
would
but
for
the
existence
of
the
in
pari
delicto
defense,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
that's
the
one
hypothetical--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--no,
but
the--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--justice
white--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--justice
white,
an
insider
trading
case
is
an
actual
fraud.
it
is
not
different
from
an
actual
fraud,
it
is--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--on
the
shareholder
that
sells
the
stock.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
the
shareholder
that
sells
the
stock
without
being
told
the
truth,
that's
the
fraud.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
well,
it
is
a--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--it
is
a
fraudulent
or
deceptive
practice
under
section
10.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
no.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
if
he
just
lies
to
his
customer,
he
has
defrauded
his
customer.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
that's
right,
he
has
just
defrauded
his
friend.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
i
do,
if
the
customer,
knowing
of
the
wrongful
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
capitalized
on
it
to
his
own
benefit
to
go
out
and
commit
the
fraud
that
he
intended
to
commit
on
the
customer.
he
is
a
fraudulent
party
just
as
the
defendant,
and
that's
the
only
hypothetical
in
which
in
pari
delicto
can
arise.
if
there
is
no
cause
of
action
against
the
defendant
in
the
first
place,
we
are
not
talking
about
in
pari
delicto,
we
are
talking
about
no
claim.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
it's
clear
that
the
plaintiffs
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
acting
for
personal
gain,
and
it
is
their
mind
set
that
we
look
at.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
in
the
case
of
in
pari
delicto,
i
think
we
are
looking
at
what
the
tippee
thought,
but
let's
add
both.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
now,
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
however,
in
this
case,
what
is
clear
here
is
that
mr.
lazzaro
told
them
that
he
had
in
side
information
from
that
officer.
they
called
the
officer,
and
he
told
them
it
was
nonpublic
in
other
words,
they
shouldn't
have
it,
that
nobody
else
would
receive
it
until
later,
but
that
mr.
lazzaro
was
a
very
good
and
trustworthy
man,
he
knew
they
were
dealing
with
lazzaro,
he
knew
they
were
going
to
buy
the
stock,
he
knew
that
would
benefit
lazzaro,
it
would
make
lazzaro
look
like
a
very
smart
man.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
it
was
made
clear
in
dirks,
i
thought,
that
on
an
objective
fact
basis
we
would
look
to
see
whether
there
was
any
benefit
to
the
insider,
meaning
wrongful
desire
to
secure
something
for
himself,
either
monetarily,
or
to
give--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--it
did
not
say
those
words.
however,
it
never
will.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
justice
o'connor,
we
look
at
the
facts
in
the
complaint,
and
those
facts,
while
they
don't
say
he
personally
gained,
they
show
that
he
did
personally
gain.
they
show
that
he
gifted
or
benefitted
a
stock
broker.
he
selective
released
information
in
a
way
that
would
benefit
that
stockbroker.
it
alleges
that
he
himself
owned
a
hundred
thousand
shares
of
stock.
it
is
alleged
that
the
stock
broker
owned
the
shares
of
stock--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--and
it
drove
the
price
up,
yes,
for
the
benefit
of
all.
so
the
facts
alleged
show
that
personal
gain.
we
don't
need
to
have
the
complaint
say
it
in
fact
was--
mr.
robert
s.
warren
--all
right.
the
fact
is
that
the
comparison
of
i
believe
it
is
paragraphs
16
and
33
of
the
complaint,
16
being
the
representations,
and
33
being
the
falsity,
shows
that
we
have
a
mixture,
in
other
words,
that
they
don't
contend
there
wasn't
any
gold
find;
they
quarrel
with
its
state
of
development.
they
don't
contend
that
there
were
no
joint
venture
negotiations
they
simply
quarrel
with
the
stage
at
which
those
negotiations
had
progressed.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
think,
on
the
other
hand,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
all
false.
mr.
robert
s.
warren
because
as
in
the
case
of
judge
weinfeld,
i
believe
that
is
beside
the
point.
i
believe
that
an
attempt
to
commit
wrong
based
upon
what
you
believe
is
criminal
activity
is
plenty
enough
for
in
pari
delicto.
it
is
plenty
enough
for
punishment
for
crime.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i
am
through.
i'm
very
sorry.
thank
you.
