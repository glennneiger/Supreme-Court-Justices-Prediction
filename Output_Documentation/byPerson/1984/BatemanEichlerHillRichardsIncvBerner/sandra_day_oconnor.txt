justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
warren,
is
the
tippee
liable
derivatively
through
lazzaro
or
directly,
in
your
view,
from
mr.
neadeau?
justice
o'connor
we
have
to
look
at
this
based
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
do
we
not?
justice
o'connor
and
the
complaint
does
not
say,
of
course,
how
mr.
lazzaro
got
his
information
or
what
it
was
that
mr.
neadeau
told
mr.
lazzaro,
if
anything.
justice
o'connor
it
could
be
a
total
fabrication
by
mr.
lazzaro
that
he
was
told
anything
by
mr.
neadeau.
justice
o'connor
well,
just
looking
at
the
face
of
the
complaint,
that
could
be
true,
could
it
not?
justice
o'connor
and
therefore,
no
derivative
liability
of
the
tippee
through
mr.
lazzaro
from
the
face
of
the
complaint
alone.
justice
o'connor
and
what
is
it
that
mr.
neadeau
said
directly
to
the
tippee
that
you
say
imposes
this
liability
on
the
part
of
the
tippee?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
the
complaint
discloses
that
mr.
neadeau
refused
to
confirm
or
deny
that.
justice
o'connor
in
your
view,
mr.
warren,
would
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
always
be
available
then
to
a
tippee
who
voluntarily
trades
on
what
is
represented
to
be
insider
information?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
it
is
correct
to
say
that
at
common
law,
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
was
available
in
an
action
for
fraud?
justice
o'connor
mr.
warren--
justice
o'connor
--dirks
seemed
to
talk
in
terms
of
a
requirement
that
the
insider,
the
tipster,
act
for
personal
gain.
now
if
in
this
case
the
only
thing
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
that
we
look
to
is
mr.
neadeau,
is
it
clear
that
he
was
acting
for
personal
gain?
justice
o'connor
well,
did
dirks
look
at
what
the
tippee
thought,
or
did
dirks
also
speak
in
terms
of
a
requirement
that
the
tipster
be
acting
for
personal
gain?
justice
o'connor
so
suppose
the
tipster
just
let
it
slip
at
a
golf
game,
no
personal
gain
at
all.
justice
o'connor
well,
how
does
that
relate
to
any
personal
gain
by
neadeau?
justice
o'connor
well,
did
the
complaint
allege
that
mr.
neadeau
was
going
to
gain
personally?
justice
o'connor
well,
since
we
look
only
at
the
complaint,
it
looks
to
me
like
you
don't
have
in
pari
delicto
defense
here.
