justice
white
by
what?
justice
white
by
passing
out
false
information
or
what,
or
by...
or
withholding
information?
justice
white
so
if
equal...
if
close
to
equal
fault
is
essential
for
the
defense
to
be
invoked,
what
is
the
difference
between...
is
there
some
difference
between
these...
the
tipper,
the
tipster
and
the
tippee,
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
they
also...
they
also
intended
to
use
inside
information.
justice
white
well
so
did
the
tipster.
both
of
them.
justice
white
well,
then,
the
tipster
not
only
was
purporting
to
use
inside
information,
but
he
was
also
lying.
justice
white
and
the
tippee,
the
tippee
didn't
lie
to
anybody,
he
just
didn't
tell
them
what
the
facts
were.
justice
white
yes,
but
the
tipster
might
be
stuck
under
state
law
for
defrauding
somebody.
justice
white
he
wouldn't
be...
but
the
tippee
wouldn't
be
committing
a
state
law
offense
by
just
not...
just
by
saying
caveat
emptor.
justice
white
you
have
statutory.
justice
white
you
have
statutory
remedies.
justice
white
so
the
tippee
wants
to
buy
some
stock
from
some
stockholder
because
he
thinks
the
stock
is
going
up.
he
just
doesn't
tell
him
why
he
thinks
the
stock
is
going
up,
that
would
be
his...
would
give
the
seller
of
the
stock
a
remedy
under
state
law?
justice
white
i
understand
that.
justice
white
well,
why
don't
we
leave
out
all
these...
why
don't
you
just
say
that
the
insider,
the
tipster
is,
say,
an
officer
of
the
corporation.
justice
white
and
he
tips
a
friend.
we
are
going
to
buy
a
gold
mine.
justice
white
and
that
friend
then
goes
out
and
buys
a
bunch
of
corporate
stock
without
revealing
anything,
without
revealing
that
he
is
dealing
in
inside
information.
justice
white
those
people
he
bought
the
stock
from
have
a
cause
of
action
against
him.
justice
white
yes,
they
do.
and
does
the
tippee
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
tipster?
justice
white
what
if
it...
but
that's
only
on
the
assumption--
justice
white
--yes,
but
that's
only
on
the
assumption
though
that
the
inside
information
is
true.
suppose
it
is
false.
there
is
no
dealing
in
inside
information
at
all.
he
has
not
revealed
any
inside
information.
that
is
just
a
dream
world.
and
so
wouldn't
the
tippee
then
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
fellow
who
is
passing
out
false
information?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
white
--in
this
case,
in
this
case,
in
this
case
you
are
comparing,
as
justice
stevens
and
i
were
pursuing
before,
you
are
comparing
dealing
in
inside
information
with
deliberate
fraud.
justice
white
and
the
only,
in
really
inside
information
case,
the
tipster
has
breached
his
duty
to
the
stockholders.
justice
white
and
you
are
trying
to
enforce
that
also
through
the
tippee.
justice
white
on
whom,
on
whom?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
it's
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
is
that...
you
can
call
it
that
or
anything.
justice
white
that's
fraud,
a
type
of
fraud.
justice
white
and
you
say
that's...
if
that's
all
the...
and
you
think
that
the
tipster
who
does
that...
suppose
he
just
lies,
as
i
said.
do
you
think
that
is...
that
he
has
committed
a
fraud
on
the
stockholders?
justice
white
if
he
just
lies?
justice
white
all
right,
he
has
lied
to
his
friend,
and
he
has
committed
on
fraud
on
the
stockholders
of
the
corporation.
justice
white
and
so
then
i
would
think
you
still
think,
though,
in
that
case
there
would
be
in
pari
delicto
defense.
justice
white
and
drove
the
price
up.
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
one
quick
question?
do
we
judge
this
case,
or
does
the
record
show,
or
are
there
findings
as
to
whether
or
not
the
tipster
here
conveyed
both
true
and
false
information
or
only
true
or
only
false?
justice
white
so
you
think
that
the
complaint
on
its
face
alleges
that
part
of
it
is
false
and
part
of
it
is
true?
justice
white
i
know,
i
know.
justice
white
well,
would
the
tippee
in
this
case
have
been...
be
liable
to
those
people
that
he
bought
stock
from?
justice
white
because?
because
nobody,
there
was
no
actual
use
of
inside
information?
justice
white
so
you
think
we
have
to
read
the
complaint
as
alleging
everything
was
false.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
we
don't
agree
with
you,
part
fault,
part
true,
and
so
there
was
some
use
of
inside
information,
which
the
person
who
bought
the
stock
on
the
open
market
didn't
disclose.
justice
white
i
know,
but
let
me
just
give
you
my
question
again.
justice
white
let's
assume
we
don't
agree
with
you
and
that
the
complaint
says
part
true,
part
false.
now
what
about
the
position
of
the
tippee
vis-a-vis
the
person
he
bought
stock
from
without
disclosing?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
so
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
white
so
he
failed
to
disclose,
and
he
could
be
held
liable
under
the
securities
laws.
justice
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
white
so
at
least
he
is
delicto.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
and
the
argument
would...
then
the
question
would
come
down,
is
it
in
pari
delicto.
justice
white
yes,
but
it
was
made
below.
justice
white
that's
why
the
cast
is
here.
justice
white
so
as
far
as
they
are
concerned,
there
was
no
use
of
inside
information
at
all.
justice
white
well,
if
it
was
false,
it
wasn't.
justice
white
i
agree
with
you,
i
agree
with
you.
justice
white
so
your
submission
is
that
we
ought
to
just,
in
this
case
at
least,
forget
the
notion
of
equal
fault?
justice
white
i
should
say
that
no
matter
whether
they
are
equal
or
not,
enforcement
of
the
securities
laws
is
so
important
that
the
defense
should
not
be
allowed.
justice
white
because?
justice
white
well,
the
tippees,
assuming
there
was
some
true
information
that
wasn't
disclosed,
the
tippees
also
are
in
trouble,
aren't
they,
with
the
people
they
bought
from.
justice
white
under
the
securities
law.
justice
white
well,
but
that
is...
you
think
that
is
less
reprehensible
than
what
the
broker
and
the
tipster
did?
justice
white
because
of
their
special
position?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
in
this
connection,
please,
if
all
the
information
that
the
broker
and
the
insider
handed
out
was
false,
all
of
it
was
false,
and
they
knew
it
to
be
false,
and
they
passed
it
out
to
the
investor
who
acted
on
it
thinking
it
was
true
inside
information,
he
buys
stock,
the
stock
goes
down,
is
then
the
investor
liable
to
the
people
he
bought
from?
justice
white
yes,
because
there
really,
he
wasn't
using
inside
information.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
yes.
in
that
event,
he
wouldn't
be
in
delicto
at
all.
justice
white
what
would
he
be?
justice
white
they
may
be
similar
cases,
but
your
view
is
that
he
wouldn't
be
in
delicto
at
all.
justice
white
so,
but
he...
but
certainly
his
rights
were
violated
at
the
outset.
justice
white
i
see.
all
right.
