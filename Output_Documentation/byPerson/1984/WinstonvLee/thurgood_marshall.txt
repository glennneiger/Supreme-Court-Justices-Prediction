haven't
people
died
during
simple
operations?
justice
marshall
like
tonsillitis.
they
have
died,
some
people
have.
justice
marshall
don't
you
agree
that
any
operation
is
serious
if
you
out
somebody?
justice
marshall
here
they
were
talking
about
the
expert's
testimony.
was
that
contradicted
by
you?
justice
marshall
did
you
contradict
the
expert's
testimony?
justice
marshall
i
mean,
that's
in
the
record?
justice
marshall
it
is
not
in
the
record?
justice
marshall
but
that
doesn't
give
you
a
right
to
take
one,
does
it?
justice
marshall
i
mean,
all
i
am
saying
is,
the
fact
that
it
makes
it
easier
for
the
prosecutor
isn't
a
right
of
the
prosecutor.
justice
marshall
that
is
not
what
i
said.
justice
marshall
it
makes
it
easier.
justice
marshall
you
are
not
alleging
that
at
all.
justice
marshall
you
are
not
urging
that
on
us
at
all?
justice
marshall
and
the
record
of
other
cases
will
show
that
sometimes
you
can't
find
any
grooves.
justice
marshall
the
barrel
of
the
gun
is
so
corroded,
it
will
not
show
at
all.
justice
marshall
i
don't
know.
in
schmerber
you
could
go
back
and
get
another
one.
