justice
stevens
while
you
are
on
that
point,
do
you
understand
that
if
you
do
go
to
trial
without
the
bullet,
you
would
be
able
to
put
into
evidence
the
refusal
of
the
defendant
to
submit
to
this
operation?
justice
stevens
that
would
be
a
rather
persuasive
bit
of
evidence
in
itself,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
then
you
ask
him,
why
didn't
you
have
this
operation?
what
is
he
going
to
say?
justice
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
why
your
adversary
doesn't
consent
to
the
operation?
justice
stevens
and
he
does
not
place
on
the
record
any
reason
for
not
having
the
operation?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that's
not
all
the
evidence
you've
got.
you've
got
the
fact
you
made
a
rather
detailed
investigation
to
corroborate
his
story
and
there
is
no
other
bloody
person
hanging
around
richmond
within
that
eight-block
area.
isn't
that
true?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
the
probabilities
are
fairly
remote,
it
seems
to
me,
that
this
denial
will
have
any
credibility.
i
just...
i
don't
think
this
is
quite
right
like
the
normal
case
of
a
one
on
one
situation,
because
this
fellow's
got
a
bullet
in
him,
and
nobody
else
was
found
with
a
bullet,
if
i
understand
the
facts
correctly.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
i
don't...
really,
i
just
don't
think
this
is
a
typical
one
on
one
confrontation
between
a
defendant
and
the
victim.
justice
stevens
well,
except
that
you've
got
the
alleged
perpetrator
here
who
admittedly
has
a
bullet
in
him,
and
he
is
not
willing
to
explain
where
it
came...
we've
got
a
theory
about
where
it
came
from
which
is
highly
implausible.
justice
stevens
there
is
no
corroboration.
you
don't
have
dead
bodies
sitting
around
in
richmond,
i
don't
suppose,
that
you
don't...
that
the
police
can't
find.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you
can
surely
put
into
evidence
the
fact
that
he
would
not
consent
to
the
operation.
justice
stevens
at
least
i
would
think
so.
maybe
i
missed
some
rule
or
virginia
evidence
law.
justice
stevens
well,
anyway,
i
shouldn't...
i
am
getting
off
on
a
collateral
point,
i
guess.
you
would
have
an
easier
case
if
you
had
a
confession,
too,
wouldn't
you?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
think
the
test
would
vary
at
all
depending
on
if
the
bullet
were
not
in
the
accused
person,
but
rather
were
in
a
third
party,
a
witness's
body?
would
either
have
a
stronger
right
to
object
than
the
other?
do
you
know?
justice
stevens
so
you
would
say
it
is
the
same
case.
i
would
be
curious
to
know
whether
the
state
takes
the
same
view.
it
is
the
same
case
as
if
just
a
witness--
justice
stevens
--yes.
justice
stevens
so
not
only
would
you
say
that
it
is
not
different
whether
it
is
a
witness
or
a
defendant,
but
it
also
should
be
the
same
test
if
the
defendant
wanted
the
evidence
as
if
the
state
wanted
it.
justice
stevens
mr.
winston,
do
you
agree
that
the
record
does
not
show
the
reason
for
the
refusal?
justice
stevens
and
what
is
the
reason?
justice
stevens
but
that
doesn't
tell
us
why
he
doesn't
want
to
be
cut
open.
justice
stevens
is
this
in
the
record...
now,
i
am
just
asking...
or
are
you
now
telling
me
what
you
think?
justice
stevens
and
there
is
no
explanation
of
why
he
might
not
want
to
have
the
benefit
of
exculpatory
evidence
available?
justice
stevens
general
garrett,
can
i
ask
you
if
you
would
apply
the
same
standard
that
you
seek
to
apply
in
this
case
if
the
bullet
were
lodged
in
a
witness
rather
than
a
potential
defendant?
justice
stevens
because
you
have
to...
even
though
you
have
a
lot
of
evidence,
we
have
to
treat
him
as
presumptively
innocent.
justice
stevens
and
i
gather
it
would
have
to
be
the
same
standard
if
the
defendant
were
seeking
the
evidence.
