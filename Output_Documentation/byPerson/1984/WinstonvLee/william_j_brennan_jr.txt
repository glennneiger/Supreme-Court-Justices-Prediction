justice
jr.
well,
what
would
you
have
done
if
the
finding,
if
they
got
the
bullet
out
and
then
couldn't
say
that
it
was
fired
from
the
victim's
gun?
justice
jr.
you
would
go
to
trial?
justice
jr.
but
the
surgery
would
have
been
for
nothing.
what
is
the
prospect
that
if
they
took
the
bullet
out
it
would
be
discovered
that
they
couldn't
say
whether
it
did
or
didn't
come
from
the
victim's
gun?
justice
jr.
i
understood
that
sometimes
you
can't.
you
can
get
the
bullet
out,
but
you
can't
say
whether
it
did
or
didn't
come
from
the
victim's
gun.
justice
jr.
only
in
those
circumstances?
justice
jr.
i
notice
in
respondent's
brief
the
statement
that
the
firearms
identification
expert
didn't
know
whether
or
not
a
microscopic
examination
of
the
bullet
itself
would
show
that
it
was
fired
from
that,
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"there
is
a
statistical
probability
of
20
percent
that
watkinson's
gun
will
not
be
capable
to
replicate
firing.
"
was
there
that
kind
of
evidence?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
winston,
if
we
reverse,
how
much
balancing
may
judges
do
in
circumstances
like
this?
justice
jr.
if
we
reverse,
and
say
that
the
intrusion
to
this
extent,
at
least,
is
permissible
without
violating
any
of
the
principles
of
schmerber.
justice
jr.
mr.
winston,
may
i
ask,
you
didn't
get...
or
rather,
what
relief
you
did
get
on
habeas
in
the
district
court
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
it?
justice
jr.
but
you
brought
both
the
habeas
and
a
1983
action.
justice
jr.
and
the
relief
you
got
was
in
the
1983
suit?
justice
jr.
and
you
got
habeas,
too,
did
you?
justice
jr.
i
didn't
understand
what
it
meant
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
wasn't
cognizable
on
habeas
because
it
related
only
to
conditions
of
confinement.
justice
jr.
well,
really,
what
i
am
getting
at
is,
do
we
still
have
the
habeas
here,
or
do
we
have
only
the
1983--
justice
jr.
--so
the
habeas
is
not
here.
justice
jr.
it
is
only
the
1983
suit.
justice
jr.
all
right.
you
could
have
attempted
to
come
here
from
the
virginia
supreme
court's
refusal
to
take
your
appeal?
i
guess
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
final
judgment,
would
it?
