justice
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
an
automobile,
not
a
person,
i
take
it.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
garrett,
judge
widener
in
his
dissent
in
the
fourth
circuit
felt
that
the
cases
of
younger
and
harris
and
perez
against
ladezma
should
have
prevented
the
federal
courts
from
ever
getting
into
this
case
before
it
had
run
its
process
in
the
state,
but
he
criticized
the
majority
for
not
discussing
it.
did
the
state
ever
raise
those
points?
justice
rehnquist
you
didn't
raise
them
in
the
fourth
circuit?
justice
rehnquist
but
all
you
are
saying
is
that
the
state
has
asked
that
the
fourth
circuit's
holding
be
reviewed,
not
that
they
submitted
themselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
and
my
understanding
from
what
your
opponent
said
was
that
they
raised
this
point
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
ruled
against
them
on
this
point.
justice
rehnquist
and
the
district
court
ruled
against
them
on
that?
