chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
winston
against
lee.
mr.
garrett,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
didn't
one
physician
say
that
it
could
be
done
with
a
local
anesthetic
in
about
20
minutes?
chief
justice
burger
from
your
earlier
response
to
one
of
the
questions,
you
said
that
if
the
bullet
were
extracted
on
the
ballistic
tests,
or
you
intimated
if
you
didn't
say
it,
that
the
ballistic
tests
showed
that
it
had
not
come
from
the
gun
of
this
man
that
had
been
found.
are
we
to
take
it
that
you
would
probably
dismiss?
chief
justice
burger
the
state
would
probably
dismiss?
chief
justice
burger
so
the
search,
the
examination
of
the
bullet
is
in
your
view
as
much
to
produce
his
innocence
as
his
guilt?
chief
justice
burger
where
was
this
gun
located?
chief
justice
burger
yes.
precisely
when
did
the
police
first
come
into
possession
of
his
gun?
chief
justice
burger
there
is
no
doubt
about
whose
gun?
chief
justice
burger
but
the
blood
test
would
tie
it
up.
is
that
so?
chief
justice
burger
so
that
your
bullet
is
just
like
the
blood.
chief
justice
burger
did
the
record
show
what
happened
to
the
storekeeper's
gun
or
the
victim's
gun?
no,
excuse
me,
the
robber's
gun,
lee's
gun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
winston?
chief
justice
burger
it
is
also
true
that
major
surgery
is
sometimes
performed
with
a
local
anesthetic,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
does
the
ex-ray
dispose
the
caliber
of
the
bullet?
chief
justice
burger
and
you
say
the
record
does
not
show
as
of
now
what
is
the
caliber
of
the
bullet
that
is
under
his
collarbone
or
near
his
collarbone?
chief
justice
burger
is
it
ascertainable,
if
you
know?
chief
justice
burger
wouldn't
that
be
a
routine
police
practice
in
any
such
case
as
this?
chief
justice
burger
yes.
chief
justice
burger
yes.
so
that
whether
it
is
in
the
record
or
not,
we
could
judicially
notice
that
that
is
standard
police
procedure.
chief
justice
burger
was
there
any
cross
examination
about
what
his
medical
history
on
surgery
had
been
up
to
that
time?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
the
invasion
of
privacy
is
fundamentally
different
from
what
it
was
in
schmerber,
extracting
blood?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
garrett?
chief
justice
burger
does
the
record
show
why
the
surgeons
in
the
emergency
room
didn't
remove
that
bullet
at
the
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
