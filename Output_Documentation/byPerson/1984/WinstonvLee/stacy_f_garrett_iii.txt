mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
1982,
rudolph
lee
attempted
to
rob
a
supermarket,
and
for
his
efforts
received
a
bullet
in
his
shoulder.
the
only
witness
to
that
shooting
was
the
victim,
who
returned
fire
and
put
the
bullet
in
mr.
lee's
shoulder.
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
seeking
to
recover
that
bullet
from
mr.
lee's
shoulder
as
corroborative
evidence
in
his
prosecution
for
attempted
robbery
and
for
the
shooting
of
the
store
owner
who
shot
mr.
lee.
in
my
petition
for
certiorari,
i
asked
the
court
to
establish
for
the
first
time
a
standard
by
which
all
courts,
particularly
our
court,
can
have
to
determine
when
and
when
not
surgery
can
be
mandated
upon
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
to
recover
from
his
body
evidence
that
would
be
used
in
the
prosecution
of
that
person
for
a
crime
which
it
is
alleged
that
he
committed.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir,
i
do.
historically
in
virginia,
in
richmond
in
particular,
one
on
one
situations
where
the
only
eye
witness
is
the
victim,
juries
have
been
very,
very
reluctant
to
convict
if
it
only
gets
one
man's
word
against
the
other.
in
this
case
it
is
more
complicated
because
lee
claims
that
shortly
after
or
at
the
same
time
the
alleged
robbery
took
place,
he
himself
was
the
victim
of
a
robbery
some
eight
to
ten
blocks
away,
and
claims
that
is
how
he
received
the
bullet
wound
when
the
people
robbed
him.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
pardon
me?
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
recently
had
a
case
where
there
were
three
witnesses
in
a
situation
like
that,
and
the
jury
came
back
and
found
the
defendant
not
guilty,
claiming
that
particular
reason.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
but
it
is
still--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--yes,
sir,
it
would,
but
it
also
is
clouded
by
the
fact
that
he
says,
sure,
i
have
a
bullet
in
me,
but
i
didn't
get
it
from
attempting
to
rob
the
supermarket.
i
got
it
when
somebody
tried
to
rob
me
and
shot
me.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
hold
my
body
inviolate.
i
don't
want
anybody
to
go
into
it
for
any
reason,
i
would
assume
would
be
his
argument.
this
court
has
never
had
the
opportunity
to--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--if
i
understand
you,
ma'am,
the
deeper
the
bullet,
or
the
more
complicated
it
is
to
get
it?
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
somewhat.
yes,
ma'am.
if
the
bullet
were
located
next
to
his
heart,
or
in
some
cases
if
it
were
in
his
spine
or
in
a
joint
where
the
removal
would
cause
a
possibility
for
that
joint
not
to
be
used
any
more,
or
could
cause
some
real
serious
harm
to
the
defendant,
i
don't
think
the
state
should
be
entitled
to
have
the
bullet.
but
when
you
have
the
situation
here,
the
bullet
is
right
under
his
collarbone,
and
his
doctor,
dr.
mendez-picon,
and
the
anesthesiologist,
dr.
boyan,
have
both
palpated
the
bullet,
and
can
feel
it
right
from
the
surface.
there
has
been
a
hang-up
in
some
of
the
cases
between
major
surgery
and
minor
surgery.
i
think
it
can
be
simplified.
in
the
words
of
dr.
mendez-picon,
this
is
a
simple
operation.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
am
sure
they
have
somewhere.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
am
sure...
yes,
sir,
they
have
died.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
all
operations
are
serious.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
the
anesthesiologist
in
this
particular
case
has
performed
over
150,000,
and
he
has
yet
to
lose
the
very
first
one.
he
has
performed
many
of
these,
and
his
hospital
has
never
lost...
where
this
is
going
to
go,
has
never
lost
a
single
patient
for
this
type
of
surgery.
minor
surgery
done
with
general
anesthesia
is
now
the
common
trend.
it
is
done
because
it
is
quicker,
it
is
easier
for
the
surgeon,
it
is
less
painful
for
the
person
undergoing
the
surgery.
as
dr.
boyan
says,
they
go
in
at
10:00
o'clock
in
the
morning,
and
they
are
out
by
3:00.
they
walk
out
of
the
hospital.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
they
ruled...
yes,
sir,
that
was
their
reason,
because
it
was
a
general
anesthesia.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
don't
think
so.
no,
sir.
i
wouldn't
be
here
if
i
did.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
the
anesthesiologist
said
it
could
be,
but
in
this
case
it
was
the
particular
surgeon
who
said,
i
want
to
use
a
general
anesthesia.
it
is
the
surgeon
who
decides
whether
local
or
general
could
be
used.
it
could
be
taken
out
with
a
very
light
anesthesia.
the
doctor
said
that
by
the
time
he
is
asleep,
the
procedure
will
be
all
over.
it
is
a
very,
a
very
simple,
a
very
straightforward...
they
don't
have
a
lot
of
exploratory
to
do.
they
know
exactly
where
the
bullet
is.
they
can
feel
it,
and
go
right
to
it.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
think
that
should
be
one
of
the
tests.
i
think
the
test
should
include
an
analysis
of
the--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--you
can
get
into
debate
as
to
what
is
minor
and
what
is
major.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
think
any
test,
whatever
it
be,
has
to
include
the
amount
of
risk
to
the
victim,
or
to
the
person
undergoing
the
surgery.
one
doctor,
dr.
williams,
who,
by
the
way,
never
examined
mr.
lee--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--that
is
an
artful
term,
ma'am,
and
it
is
hard
to
say.
what
one
person
says
is
minor...
i
think
if
the
medical
people
say
it
is
minor.
to
a
school
teacher,
going
in
and
having
your
oil
changed
might
be
a
major
operation,
but
for
a
mechanic
it
is
simple.
it
is
a
very
minor
thing,
but
for
her
it
is
not,
or
him,
if
the
school
teacher
is
a
man.
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
if
there
is
a
substantial
chance
of
a
person
dying,
or
a
substantial
risk
of
having
a
limb
being
affected,
or
not
being
able
to
use,
i
don't
think
that
the
state
should
have
the
right
to
have
that
bullet.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
that
is
the
way
i
define
it.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
mean,
i
don't...
what
is
minor
or
major.
there
is
a
balance
that
has
to
be
struck,
i
feel,
in
this
case,
the
right
of
mr.
lee
to
say,
look,
i've
got
a
bullet
in
me.
i
claim
i
came
from
an
attempted
robbery.
the
commonwealth
claims
that
he
came
from...
or
i
tried
to
rob
somebody
else.
does
he
get
to
keep
that
at
no
risk
to
himself
because
the
doctors
say
that
keeping
the
bullet
in
him
right
now
will
have
no
effect
on
him,
you
know,
life-threatening
one
way
or
the
other.
on
the
other
hand,
the
balance
must
be
considered
what
right
do
the
citizens
of
the
country
have,
or
richmond,
to
have
evidence
to
be
used
in
a
criminal
trial?
are
we
to
allow
a
criminal
or
a
person
who
is
alleged
to
have
committed
a
crime
to
perhaps
go
free
because
of
this
bullet
that
is
in
him
that
with
very
little
risk
to
him,
a
very
small
risk
to
him--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--i
am
not
sure
the
record
contains
much.
i
think
it
is
my
experience
as
a
prosecutor
that
it
is
very
probative.
here
we
have,
in
this
case
the
lab
has
bullets
taken
from
mr.
watkinson's
gun
that
can
be
compared
against
the
bullet.
i
have
checked
with
the
ballistician
about
it,
and
they
are
ready,
if
the
bullet
is
taken
out
from
mr.
lee,
to
compare
it.
it
is
something...
it
is
more
important
for
the
jury
to
put
their
hands
on.
instead
of
saying
on
the
one
hand,
here
is
mr.
watkinson,
this
man
tried
to
rob
me,
and
over
here
we
have
mr.
lee,
who
says,
i
didn't
try
to
rob
you,
or
if
he
stands
mute,
one
man's
word
against
another,
we
have
something
the
jury
can
put
their
hands
on.
it
is
like
a
fingerprint.
we
can
show,
yes,
this
is
the
man
who
robbed
you.
or,
most
importantly,
perhaps,
perhaps
that
bullet
didn't
come
from
rudolph
lee's
gun...
or
mr.
watkinson's
gun,
and
if
that
is
the
case,
then
for
two
years
now
a
robber,
somebody
who
did
shoot
him,
has
been
running
around
free,
because
we
have
been
trying
to
get
the
wrong
person.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
don't
think
it
would
probably
be
in
perfect
condition.
they
tell
us
that
when
a
bullet
comes
into
the
body
like
that,
like
sand
into
an
oyster
shell,
it
forms
a
protective
coating
around
it,
and
the
ex-rays
show
that
the
bullet,
which
is
not
fragmented,
has
got
dents
slightly
in
the
nose
of
it,
but
otherwise
it
is
intact.
the
bullet
has
not
disintegrated.
and
i
believe
that
from
talking
to
everybody
and
the
reading
i
have
done,
we
can
be
able
to
compare
that
bullet
with
the
one
that
we
have
on
file
from
mr.
watkinson's
gun.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
they
minimized
that
interest
by
saying
that
the
risk
to
mr.
lee
was
too
great.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
initially
when
we
went
into
federal
court,
they
were
raised.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no,
sir,
it
was
not
raised
in
the
fourth
circuit
at
all.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
just
dismiss
the
charge.
absolutely.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
would
have
to
go
to
trial
with
that
knowledge.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir,
because
mr.
watkinson
is--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--i
cannot
answer
that
100
percent,
sir,
because
we
don't
know
until
we
actually
see
the
bullet,
but
from
all
indication,
they
will
be
able
to
tell,
because--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--yes,
sir.
that
is
normally
because
it
has
hit
a
hard
object,
such
as
a
bone,
or
has
hit
a
metal
object,
or
a
piece
of
stone,
like
the
pillow
behind
you.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
most
of
the
time.
yes,
sir.
or
the
gun
itself,
the
barrel
and
the
lens
and
grooves
have
so
corroded
themselves
that
you
can't
get
a
good
pattern.
we
know
that
is
not
true,
because
in
this
case
the
laboratory
now
has
sample
bullets
of
the
same
taken
from
mr.
watkinson's
gun,
and
they
are
clean,
and
they
are
readily
identifiable,
the
lens
and
the
grooves,
and
the
individual
characteristics
of
that
particular
bullet.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
where
was
the
gun
located,
sir?
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
moments
after
the
shooting.
mr.
watkinson
was
trying
to
look
to
close
his
store
up,
and
he
had
the
money
bag
in
one
hand
and
his
gun,
and
the
key.
he
locked
it
up,
and
he
turned
and
fired
the
shot,
and
he
was
shot,
and
the
police
were
called,
and
they
arrived
at
the
scene
and
took
possession
of
his
weapon.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no,
sir,
none
at
all.
none
in
the
record.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no,
sir.
we
have
fired
mr.
watkinson's
gun,
and
we
have
the
bullets
that
were
taken
from
it,
and
the
lens
and
grooves
are
very
clear
on
it,
and
they
can
be
readily
discernible
by
the
ballistics
expert
to
compare
against
the
bullet
should
this
court
allow
me
to
take
it
from
mr.
lee's
shoulder.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
the
tests
were
run
after
that
hearing
was
held.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
did
i
contradict
it?
no,
sir.
i
am
talking
about
the
same
person.
the
same
person
who
testified,
mr.
moorhead,
was
the
same
person
who
talked
to
me
later.
he
said,
after
the
tests
were
run,
and
an
examination
of
the
bullets
from
mr.
watkinson's
gun--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--no,
sir,
because
it
happened
afterwards.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no,
sir.
he
just
says,
i
don't
want
the
surgery
to
be
done.
i
have
asked
him
many
times
if
he
will
stipulate
that
he
was
the
person
shot.
then
we
won't
have
to
go
through
it.
he
refused
to
do
that
also.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no,
sir.
he
has
never
testified,
and
his
counsel
has
never
said,
my
client
doesn't
want
the
surgery
because,
for
whatever
reason.
the
crowder
case
is
the
only
one
that
has
reached
the
circuit
court
level
other
than
this
case,
and
in
that
case,
which
this
court
refused
to
grant
certiorari
in,
said
that
the
extent
of
the
surgical
intrusion
and
the
extent
of
the
risk
to
defendant
is
the
extent
of
reasonableness
that
we
have
to
decide.
intrusion
in
this
case
is
approximately
one
inch
below
the
surface
in
an
operation
that
is
characterized
by
the
doctor
as
simple.
the
anesthesiologist
said,
as
soon
as
he
is
asleep
and
under,
the
operation
would
be
over
with,
and
he
will
be
ready
to
go
back
to
his
jail
cell
or
wherever
they
are
keeping
him.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
have
to
go
forward,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
help
it
considerably.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
considerably.
i
am
now
at
a
distinct
disadvantage,
and
at
least
with
the
bullet
i
will
have
a
50-50
chance.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir,
in
that
regard.
it
gives
the
jury
something
to
hang
their
hat
on
and
to
put
their
hands
on,
something
tangible
as
opposed
to
a
victim
on
one
side
testifying,
that's
the
man
that
shot
me,
as
opposed
to
the
defendant
sitting
here
either
moot
or
even
taking
the
stand
and
saying,
look,
i
was
robbed
somewhere
else
and
shot.
it
gives
them
something
they
can
put
their
hands
on,
and--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
it
is
typical
in
that
it
is
as
typical
as
you
can
have
when
you
have
the
alleged
perpetrator
being
shot
by
his
victim.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
at
trial--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--i
have
no
idea
how
the
trial
court
would
rule,
but
if
the
police
officer
would
testify
when
asked
the
question,
what
did
lee
tell
you
how
he
got
that
bullet,
objection,
hearsay,
would
you
advise
mr.
lee
of
his
rights,
obviously,
you
suspect
him
of
being
the
victim...
or
the
perpetrator
of
this
particular
crime.
he
was
not
advised
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
certainly.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
that
could
come
in.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
of
course.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no,
sir.
not
unless
you
do
it
within
the
guidelines
of
the
law.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
but
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
use
evidence
that
is
available.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
agree,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
it
definitely
makes
it
easier.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
no
gun
was
ever
found.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
just
briefly,
your
honor.
i
want
to
make
sure
that
everyone
understands
that
the
commonwealth's
position
is
not
that
the
bullet
is
strictly
cumulative.
it
is
the
most
reliable
evidence
that
we
have.
we
have...
an
argument
can
be
made
by
mr.
lee
that
the
identification
at
the
time
after
the
shooting
in
the
emergency
room
was
of
a
man
who
had
just
been
shot,
and
can
we
rely
on
that?
but
if
we
have
the
bullet,
that
is
the
most
reliable
evidence
that
exists
that
is
going
to
show
whether
or
not
mr.
lee
is
guilty
of
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir,
it
was
not
life-threatening.
it
was
not
life-threatening.
that
is
the
only
criteria
they
use
to
remove
it,
if
it
is
life-threatening
or
not.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
i
was
afraid
you
were
going
to
ask
that.
i
am
not
really
sure,
sir,
but
i
think
it
probably
would
be
the
same
standard.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
we
probably
end
up
with
the
same
standard.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
can't
see
any
reason
to
have
a
disparity
in
that
at
all.
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
yes,
sir.
justice
marshall
indicated
sometimes
that
you
can't
tell
from
the
bullet
whether
or
not
the
lens
and
grooves
are
there
until
after
you
get
it.
it
is
the
same
situation
in
schmerber.
they
take
the
vial
of
blood,
and
it
is
broken
before
it
gets
to
the
laboratory.
the
argument
can
be
made
that
that
is
a
waste.
it
is
not
the
same.
the
fourth
amendment--
mr.
stacy
f.
garrett,
iii
--i
don't
think
you
could,
sir,
because
the
time,
the
passage
of
time,
the
evidence
of
intoxication
was
dissipated,
and
the
alcohol
wouldn't
be
in
the
blood,
especially
if
it
were
a
day
or
so
afterwards.
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
preclude
all
searches,
only
those
that
are
unreasonable.
i
think
the
commonwealth
has
shown
through
the
evidence
that
it
is
reasonable
in
this
case
to
subject
mr.
lee
to
the
surgery,
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
allow
me
to
do
that.
thank
you.
