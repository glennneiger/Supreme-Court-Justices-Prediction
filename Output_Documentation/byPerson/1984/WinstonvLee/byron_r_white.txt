justice
white
but
what
if
it
is
a
general
anesthetic?
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that...
it
is
just
a
shock
to
the
body.
justice
white
anyway,
the
court
below
didn't
turn
on
that
at
all,
did
it,
on
whether
it
was
a
general
anesthetic?
justice
white
so
you
think
that
is
not
a
very
good
line?
justice
white
but
any
operation
that
had
any
substantial
risk
of
a
permanent
disability
or
of
death
you
wouldn't
classify
as
minor.
justice
white
that
is
your
test
then?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
the
court
below
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
even
if
it
is
very
probative
and
would
be
necessary,
you
nevertheless
couldn't
get
it.
justice
white
so
we
should
judge
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
bullet...
that
the
state
really
has
an
interest
in
getting
the
bullet.
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
reason
they
ruled
against
you
was
that
the
risk
was
too
great?
justice
white
not
that
you
didn't
need
the
bullet.
justice
white
why
shouldn't
the
state
be
put,
in
a
situation
like
this,
be
put
to
saying
to
the
court,
well,
without
this
bullet
we
will
just
have
to
dismiss?
you
now
tell
us
that
even
if
it
turns
out
that
the
bullet
is
not
the
bullet,
or
you
can't
tell
whether
it
is
or
not,
you
would
still
go
forward
with
the
prosecution?
justice
white
so
the
most
you
can
say
is
that
it
would
help
you
case.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
without
it...
you
wouldn't
dismiss
it,
though,
without
the
bullet.
justice
white
you
would
still
go
through
this.
all
it
means
is,
it
changes
the
odds
of
conviction.
justice
white
that
is
just
based
on
your
experience
with
juries
in
richmond?
justice
white
i
knew
that
that
is
what
was
proposed,
a
general
anesthetic.
justice
white
well,
at
least--
justice
white
--there
was
no
indication
in
schmerber
that
the
prosecution
would
not
have
gone
forward
without
the
blood
test.
justice
white
yes,
so
it
is
just
a
question
of
having
more
evidence
than
you
had
before.
justice
white
or
just
maybe
it
would
be
relevant
evidence,
and
any
relevant
evidence
supposedly
would
make
the
case
better
for
the
prosecution.
justice
white
but
you
know...
you
have
the
gun.
what
is
it?
justice
white
well,
he
couldn't
say
it
wasn't
a.45,
or
it
wasn't
a.22?
justice
white
don't
you
agree
that...
as
i
understand
the
state's
position
is
that
it
wouldn't
be
any
balancing
in
the
state's
position
as
long
as
the
evidence
is
relevant
and
would
improve
their
case,
and
that
is
not
a
question
of
balancing,
then
they
are
entitled
to
it
unless
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
death
or
disfigurement
or
some
other
kind
of
permanent
in
jury.
justice
white
yes,
and
that
isn't
a
balancing
test
at
all,
is
it?
once
you
decide
it
is
relevant
evidence,
you
get
it,
unless.
justice
white
yes,
well,
that
isn't
a
balancing
test
of
need
from
case
to
case.
it
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
the
need
of
the
state
except
for
just
relevance.
justice
white
i
suppose
the
danger
to
the
state's
case
is
a
matter
of
identification,
whether
the
jury
believes
the
victim.
justice
white
and
was
there
ever
a
line-up
in
this
case?
the
identification
as
far
as
the
opinions
go,
they
just
say
he
identified
him
in
the
hospital.
justice
white
and
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
then
in
bad
shape
or
not,
the
victim.
he
had
been
shot,
hadn't
he?
justice
white
was
he
in
bad
shape?
justice
white
well,
anyway,
is
that
the
only
pretrial
identification
there
was?
justice
white
there
never
was
a
line-up?
justice
white
well,
it
depends,
i
suppose,
on
how
good
a
witness
they
think
he
is,
or
maybe--
justice
white
--but
i
suppose
if
you
were
on
the
other
side,
you
would
like
to
have
the
bullet.
justice
white
whatever
happened
to
the
state's
position,
if
it
ever
expressed
it,
that
habeas
corpus
is
a...
or
this
kind
of
an
intervention
by
a
federal
court
before
there
has
ever
been
a
criminal
trial
is
wholly
contrary
to
sound
judicial
practice?
it
is
really--
justice
white
--it
really
isn't
a
younger
against
harris
case,
is
it?
i
mean,
that
isn't--
justice
white
--do
you
think
it
is
a
semi...
it
may
be,
but
isn't
it
a
semi-jurisdictional
thing?
justice
white
in
the
federal
courts?
i
don't
know
why,
if
we
don't
think
the
federal
courts
should
get
in
this
kind
of
a
position,
the
state
can't--
justice
white
--maybe
we
can
waive
younger
against
harris,
but
i
don't
know.
justice
white
didn't
you
go
up
to
the
virginia
supreme
court?
justice
white
they
turned
you
down.
justice
white
would
that
have
been...
could
you
have
brought
that
here?
justice
white
i
know
you
could
have
tried,
but
i
just...
would
it
have
been
a
final
judgment?
justice
white
was
the
defendant
in
jail
or
on
bail?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
i
correctly
described
your
position
in
speaking
with
your
opponent
that
as
long
as
it
is
relevant
evidence,
you
can
get
it
unless
there
is
a
substantial
threat
of
disfigurement
or
death
or
something
like
that?
