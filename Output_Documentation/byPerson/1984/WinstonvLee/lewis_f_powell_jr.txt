justice
jr.
mr.
garrett,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
utility
of
ballistic
test
examinations?
in
other
words,
how
frequently
are
they
probative
evidence?
justice
jr.
is
it
possible
that
the
bullet
itself,
if
it
were
extracted,
would
not
be
in
perfect
condition
for
a
comparison?
justice
jr.
mr.
winston,
at
the
time
of
the
first
series
of
hearings
in
this
case,
it
was
thought
that
the
bullet
was
only
a
half
a
centimeter
below
the
skin.
you
took
the
same
position
at
those
hearings
that
you
are
taking
today
and
that
you
took
in
the
second
hearing,
are
you
not?
justice
jr.
well,
you
have
always
taken
the
position,
as
i
understood
it,
that
there
could
be
no
cutting
without
the
permission
of
the
defendant.
justice
jr.
is
that
correct
or
not?
did
your
defendant
agree
to
the
first--
justice
jr.
--oh,
there
are
three
hearings?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
would
require
only
local
anesthesia?
justice
jr.
so
there
would
be
no
balancing
under
any
circumstances
if
any
cutting
were
required?
justice
jr.
regardless
of
how
much
the
state
may
need
the
particular
bullet?
justice
jr.
regardless
of
the
state
interest
in
obtaining
the
bullet?
justice
jr.
but
that
interest
may
vary.
suppose
there
were
four
or
five
other
witnesses
in
this
case
to
the
shooting.
justice
jr.
the
state
interest
would
be
minimal.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
were
no
witnesses,
no
other
evidence
whatever,
the
state
interest
in
obtaining
the
bullet
might
be
very
great.
but
your
position,
which
is
what
i
am
interested
in...
would
there
ever
be
a
balancing
if
the
defendant
took
the
position
this
defendant
has
taken,
that
as
counsel
you
probably
raised
if
he
wished
you
to,
that
there
could
be
no
cutting
to
obtain
any
evidence?
