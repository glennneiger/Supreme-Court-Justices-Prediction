mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
noted
justice
white
had
asked
the
question,
what
if
there
is
a
general
anesthesia
to
be
used
in
this
case.
that
is,
of
course,
a
matter
that
there
is
no
question
about
because
we
have
a
stipulation
on
that.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
yes,
your
honor.
i
just
didn't
want
there
to
be
any
question
about
that.
in
regard
to
the
risks,
mr.
garrett
has
suggested
this
morning
that
the
medical
college
of
virginia
has
never
lost
a
patient
in
a
minor
procedure
of
this
sort.
i
don't
believe
that
that
assertion
is
supported
by
the
record.
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
there
are
some
mortality
statistics
quoted
on
a
study
done
at
the
medical
college
of
virginia,
and
the
mortality
statistic
was
greater
than
zero,
and
that
means
that
somebody
has
died.
so
i
don't
believe
that
that
assertion
would
be
supported
by
the
record.
i
believe
that
the
test
that
is
being
urged
on
the
court
by
the
petitioners
is
simply
a
major-minor
surgery
distinction.
i
think
at
page
12
of
the
petitioners'
brief
petitioners
flat
out
state,
if
the
medical
personnel
characterize
the
surgery
as
minor,
no
constitutional
violation;
if
the
medical
personnel
characterize
the
surgery
as
major,
then
constitutional
violation.
and
even
if
the
reasonableness
test
as
opposed
to
the
per
se
test
is
the
proper
test
for
the
court
to
adopt,
i
don't
think
the
court
can
adopt
that
position
of
having
the
court
simply
delegate
to
a
witness
the
ultimate
question
before
it,
and
particularly
a
question
of
constitutional
magnitude.
any
reasonableness
test,
i
think,
is
a
balance.
i
think
that
there
has
first
got
to
be
a
need,
and
secondly,
the
inquiry
has
to
go
to
the
invasion
of
the
privacy
or
the
affront
to
the
dignity
of
the
individual
and
the
risk.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
well,
i
believe
that--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--i
think
it
becomes
the
initial
inquiry,
and
i
believe
that
the
need
factor...
perhaps
if
i
could
borrow
from
the--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--perhaps
i
am
in
error,
but
my
recollection
of
schmerber
is
that
need
in
the
general
sense
was
a
very
great
factor
influencing
the
court's
decision,
the
national
problem
of
drunken
driving
and
the
need
for
an
effective
test
to
determine
who
is
drunk
and
who
is
not
as
a
means
of
detecting,
both
detecting
that
behavior
and
deterring
it
in
the
future.
and
so
i
think
need
was
important
to
the
court
in
schmerber.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
may
be
incorrect,
but
i
believe
that
it
was.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
and
i
believe
in
breithaupt
as
well.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
no,
i
believe
they
would
have
gone
forward
in
that
case
as
well.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
if
it
is
beyond
merely
being
cumulative,
i
think.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
think
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
is,
since
we
have
a
defendant
in
this
case
rather
than...
i
think
this
case
is
about
people's
rights,
and
not
defendants'
rights,
but
since
we
have
a
defendant
in
this
case,
i
think
that
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
it
is,
and
it
is
the
defendant's
choice.
the
defendant
is
advised
of
those
matters,
and
is...
and
with
advice
of
counsel
has
still
chosen
to
say,
i
want
to...
i
want
my
body
to
be
held
inviolate.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
that's
not
the
way
it's
been
expressed
to
me.
the
way
it's
been
expressed
to
me
is,
i
don't
want
anybody
cutting
me.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
don't
believe
i
have
ever
changed
my
position,
but
i
am
not
sure
in
regard
to
what,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
well,
what
your
honor
has
styled
as--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--no,
i
would
say
that
my
position
has
modified
somewhat.
what
your
honor
has
styled
as
the
first
set
of
hearings...
it
was
actually
the
second
hearing.
mendez-picon
was
given
three
opinions.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
he
has
given
three
separate
opinions
at
different
points
in
time
as
to
the
location
of
the
bullet.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
originally
he
thought
it
was
much
deeper
and
would
take
about
a
45-minute
procedure
to
operate,
but
then
he
did
come
back,
as
your
honor
quite
correctly
points
out,
and
says
that
it
was
just
beneath
the
skin,
in
the
fatty
tissue.
incision
of
one
centimeter--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--local
infiltration
anesthesia,
a
solution
of
1
percent
xylocaine.
now,
in
that
case,
that
is
about
the
most
minimal
form
of
surgery
there
is,
and
i
had
to
under
that
factual
situation,
i
just
had
to
advocate
a
per
se
rule.
no
choice.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
was
the--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
well,
i
am
assuming
that
they
have
an
interest,
because
i
think
if
they
don't
have
an
interest,
we
don't
even
get
to
looking
at
how
serious
the
procedure
is.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
oh,
the
need
would
be
much
more
minimal.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
have
not
abandoned
that
position,
but
i
have
modified
it
to
some
degree,
because
under
the
facts
as
they
presently
exist,
i
don't
believe
that
i
need
a
per
se
rule.
i
believe
if
the
rule
is
a
reasonableness
rule,
the
balancing
of
the
need
against
the
affront
to
dignity
and
the
invasion
of
privacy
and
the
risks,
i
believe
that
on
these
facts
the
balance
falls
in
favor
of
mr.
lee.
but
there
may
very
well
be
reasons
why
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule
prohibiting
all
surgery.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
how
much
balancing?
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
think
that
would
create
a
great
deal
of
confusion,
because
what
we
have
here,
the
petitioners
are
urging
this
major-minor
surgery
distinction
on
the
court,
but
in
this
case
it
is
not
so
clear,
major-minor
surgery.
there
is
a
difference
of
medical
opinion.
dr.
mendez-picon
has
come
up
with
this
kind
of
an
intermediate
category
which
is
called
minor
surgery
but
under
a
general
anesthetic.
i
think
in
just
looking
at
my
attorney's
textbook
or
attorney's
dictionary,
medical
dictionary,
i
think
under
the
definition
of
minor...
major
surgery...
excuse
me...
one
of
the
factors
that
they...
one
of
the
indicia
that
they
point
to
in
determining
whether
it
is
major
or
minor
or
how
to
characterize
it
is
the
presence
of
inhalation
anesthesia,
which
will,
of
course,
be
present
should
the
procedure
go
forward
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
oh,
i
think
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
because
some
local
anesthetics
are
extremely
dangerous.
i
mean,
a
spinal
anesthetic
is
a
local
anesthetic,
or
an
epidural
anesthetic
is
a
local
anesthetic.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
don't
believe
that
it
does.
the
ex-ray--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--the
firearms
identification
expert
testified
that
it
was
a.32
caliber
revolver.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
no,
that
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
asked
the
firearms
identification
expert
about
that
on
cross
examination
at
the
hearing,
and
he
said
he
could
not
make
that
determination
from
an
ex-ray.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
well,
perhaps
i
should
have
had
a
more
lengthy
cross
examination.
in
this
case
they
are
admitting
that
this
evidence
is
only
corroborative.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
that's
my
understanding
of
the
argument.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
unless
there
is
the...
unless
the
doctor
comes
in
and
says
it
is
major
surgery--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
don't
see
how
the
fact
that
the
man
was
accused
of
a
crime
changes
his
fourth
amendment
right's
at
all.
if
anything,
once
he
has
been
accused,
he
is
cloaked
with
the
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
that
has,
of
course,
come
up
twice
in
the
past.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
says
that...
appears
to
say
that
defendants
have
fewer
fourth
amendment
rights
than
witnesses
do.
but
the
california
appellate
court
has
held
that...
they
denied
surgery.
the
defendant's
attempt
to
get
into
the
complaining
witness
body
to
recover
the
bullets,
they
denied,
but
in
so
doing
they
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
witnesses
and
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
defendants
were
the
same.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
don't
see
any
reason
for
any
difference.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
think
that's
essentially
correct.
that
is
what
he
is
representing
that
he
is
worried
about.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
that's
all
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
yes.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
he
was--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--the
confrontation
in
the
emergency
room,
that's
the
only
one
that's
reflected
in
this
record.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
there
was
not
a
line-up.
i
don't
know
whether
there
was
a
photographic
spread
or
not.
i
can't
recall.
i
would
think
it
would
be
unusual.
if
they
have
a
good
identification,
why
do
anything
to
mess
it
up?
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
well,
i
cross
examined
him
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
and
i
couldn't
shake
him.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
don't
know
that
that
is
so,
your
honor.
i
know
at
least
two
of
mr.
garrett's
former
colleagues
whose
opinion
is
that
this
case
is
a
waste
of
time,
that
they
would
have
tried
this
man
and
gotten
a
conviction
two
and
a
half
years
ago.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
the
younger
abstention
request.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
well,
the
first
thing
is,
whatever
happened
to
it,
it
is
gone
now.
i
mean,
the
petitioners
are
the
ones
now
who
have
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
it
affects
the
jurisdictional,
but--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--well,
i
think
we
had
a
nearly
identical,
very
similar
factual
situation.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
ohio
bureau
of
employment
services
against
fidori,
that
was
a
case
involving
a
state
agency
action.
the
state
agency
was
the
defendant
in
a
class
action
suit
in
the
district
court.
they
raised
younger
abstention,
even
though
it
was
a
state
agency
case
and
not
a
criminal
case.
the
district
judge
decided
against
them.
the
case
was
appealed
to
this
court.
they
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
did
not
raise
the
younger
question,
and
the
holding
here,
which
i
believe
was
unanimous,
was
that
the
rationale
of
comity
does
not
apply
when
they
have
submitted
themselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
they
had
the
chance
to
challenge
the
order,
and
did
not
challenge
it.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
oh,
no,
i
had
them
brought
into
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
it
is
difficult
to
tell
whether
they
raised
the
question
or
not,
because
they
never
filed
any
pleadings.
but
there
were
two
other
defendants
who
were
dismissed
at
the
district
court
level.
they
raised
younger.
and
it
is
my
recollection
that
they
did
join
in
that.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
ruled
against
them
on
the
younger
question.
then
they
took
it
to
the
fourth
circuit,
did
not
present
younger,
and
then
they
brought
it
here
and
have
not
presented
younger.
but
in
addition
there
are
other
reasons
why
younger
i
don't
believe
is
applicable,
why
i
think
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
ruling.
now,
i
have
heard
something
here
this
morning
for
the
first
time,
and
that
is
that
they
have
made
the
replicate
firings
from
mr.
watkinson's
gun,
in
other
words,
they
have
shot
it
and
looked
at
it,
and
now
they
know
that
it
has
grooves
on
it
that
can
be
compared.
all
i
can
say
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
they
had
the
firearms
identification
expert
testify
in
the
state
court.
no
evidence
to
that
effect
was
brought
forward
at
that
time,
and
this
is
the
first
i
have
heard
of
it.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
to
go
ahead
and
fire
the
weapon?
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
would
think
so.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
to
fire
it
to
see
if
it
does
have
grooves
on
it,
but
then
the
question
is
whether
it
has
grooves
on
it,
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect,
but
only
what
i
have
heard
for
the
first
time
this
morning.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
oh,
i
think
the--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
well,
that's
in
the
evidence
in
this
case.
i
asked
the
firearms
identification
expert,
can
you
tell
right
now
whether
it
is
identifiable
or
not?
no.
and
then
whether
you
have
the
bullet
to
make
the
comparison
with,
the
replicate
firing
from
mr.
watkinson's
gun,
that
is
only
half
the
story,
because
then
you
go
back
to
the
questioned
specimen.
now,
that
questioned
specimen
could
have
been
damaged
on
its
entry
into
the
body,
and
in
fact
dr.
mendez-picon
did
testify,
printed
at
page
34
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
it
was
damaged
in
hitting
the
collarbone.
it
retained
its
cylindrical
state,
but
it
was
damaged
somewhat.
it
was
bent.
so,
there
has
been
some
damage
to
the
bullet
that
we
know
about
in
its
entry.
and
then
the
firearms
identification
expert
testified
that
the
length,
the
deterioration
to
the
bullet
from
the
bodily
fluids
is
positively
correlated
with
the
passage
of
time.
he
could
not
testify
as
to
any
particular
rate
at
which
that
deterioration
would
occur,
but
there
is
a
positive
correlation,
and
furthermore,
since
he
knew
the
gun
was
a.32
caliber
revolver,
he
says,
well,
that
pretty
much
limits
you
to
a
lead
bullet,
and
that
is
apparently
the
softest
substance
out
of
which
bullets
are
made,
and
i
think
his
wording
was
that
they
deteriorate
much
faster.
and
so,
i
think
it
is
entirely
speculative
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
going
to
be
any
possibility
to
identify
that
bullet
after
two
and
a
half
years,
and
if
the
bullet
after
two
and
a
half
years,
and
if
the
bullet
comes
cut
and
it
is
not
identifiable,
they
have
nothing
more
than
what
they
have
now,
and
they
can
show...
they
bring
in
the
doctor
and
show
that
he
was
treated
for
a
gunshot
wound,
and
bring
in
the
doctor
and
say,
here's
the
ex-ray,
this
little
white
spot
is
the
bullet,
and
do
that
whether
or
not
they
are
allowed
to
comment
upon
the
refusal
to
allow
the
surgery.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--i
believe
that
the
record
shows
it
through
counsel.
in
other
words,
mr.--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--he
does
not
want
to
be
cut
open.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
he
believes
that
it
is
up
to
him--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--i
believe
that
my
position
and
mr.
lee's
position
through
me
has
been
consistent
and
the
same
at
all
times
in
that
regard,
that
it
is
his
and
his
doctor's
decision
to
make
whether
or
not
he
goes
under
the
knife.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
ryland

the
only
thing
in
the
record,
i
believe,
is
that
for
reasons
i
don't
know
he
has
had
two
previous
anesthesias
without
untoward
consequences.
but
again,
moving
over
from
the
need
aspect
to
the
invasion
of
the
privacy,
the
affront
to
dignity,
and
the
risks
involved--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--it
is
the
same
in
kind,
but
much
greater
in
magnitude.
i
mean,
in
schmerber,
we
are
talking
about
a
penetration
that
is
something
along
the
order
of
the
tip
of
this
pen,
and
now
we
are
talking
about,
if
dr.
mendez-picon's
opinion
is
correct,
we
are
talking
about
an
incision
five
centimeters
long
and
three
centimeters
deep,
a
many,
many,
many
times
greater
intrusion.
and,
of
course,
i
don't
think
any
physician-patient
relationship
is
ordinarily
necessary
in
the
withdrawal
of
blood.
in
other
words,
i
think
for
schmerber,
one
thing
schmerber
required
in
the
blood
case
was
appropriate
personnel.
i
think
appropriate
personnel
in
blood
withdrawal
is
a
technician
or
a
nurse.
for
the
type
of
surgery
that
was
originally
contemplated
in
this
case,
that
is,
when
it
was
part
of
that
class
of
case,
that
i
have
styled
the
"just
beneath
the
skin
cases",
where
it
is
in
the
fatty
tissue,
and
they
make
a
small
incision
under
local
anesthesia
and
just
basically
pop
it
out,
for
that
kind
of...
i
think
the
reading
of
the
cases
shows
that
for
that
kind
of
operation,
you
don't
even
need...
you
don't
need
to
go
to
the
hospital.
you
just
go
to
the
doctor's
office,
and
the
doctor
doesn't
even
have
to
be
a
surgeon.
but
in
this
case,
not
only
does
he
have
to
go
to
the
hospital,
he
has
to
have
a
surgeon,
and
not
only
does
he
have
to
have
a
surgeon,
but
he
has
to
have
the
separate
doctor
who
is
the
anesthesiologist.
and
i
think
that
the
invasion
of
privacy
and
affront
to
dignity,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
any
greater
than
when
the
doctor
is
actually
going
to
be
breathing
for
the
man.
at
135
in
the
appendix,
dr.
royan
says,
"if
you
get
to
be
anesthetized,
then
you
don't
breath
so
deep.
"
"you
see,
in
order
to
bring
you
to
normal
breathing,
i
will
just
squeeze
the
bag
a
little
bit.
"
"that
expands
your
chest.
"
"otherwise,
if
i
am
not
there,
you
know,
you
give
anesthesia,
you
just
walk
off,
you
know,
then
the
doctor
has
to
be
there
to
take
care
of
the
patient
when
he
is
under
anesthesia.
"
question:
"what
would
happen
if
he
weren't
exchanging
with
sufficient
frequency
and
there
is
nobody
there?
"
"well,
then,
eventually
he
will
die.
"
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
well,
i
wouldn't
make
that
concession
at
all.
if
i
were
going
to
be
the
one
that
was
going
to
be
trying
these
indictments,
and
i
will
not
be
trial
counsel
in
this
case,
i
believe
i
would
object
to
that.
i
think
he
is
just
exercising
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
well,
of
course,
that
is
a
question
with
which
i
am
not
very
familiar,
because
in
our
state
that
is
prohibited
by
statute.
that
evidence
is
not
admissible
in
a
virginia
dwi
prosecution.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
they
vacated
on
the
ground
that
there
had
to
be,
that
the
two
remedies
were
so
inconsistent
that
when
the
plaintiff
petitioner
prosecuted
them
both
to
the
judgment
stage,
the
court
was
required
to
make
an
election.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
yes,
your
honor,
one
paper.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
we
got
a
permanent
injunction
and
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
from
judge
merritt.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
i
have
a
very
difficult
time
understanding
that
rationale,
but
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
no,
your
honor,
i
cross-petitioned
on
the
vacating
of
the
habeas
corpus,
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
yes,
your
honor.
strictly
a
civil
rights
case.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
well,
the
ruling
of
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
is
not
a
final
judgment.
i
mean,
it
is
an
interlocutory
order
in
the
case.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
on
appeal
and
habeas
corpus
and
prohibition.
it
was
all
denied.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
and
i
suppose
that
i
could
have
tried
to--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--i
suppose
that
i
could
have
tried,
but
i--
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
--possibly
on
the
prohibition
aspect
of
the
case.
but
this
case
proceeded
at
a
very
quick
pace
at
that
point
in
time.
all
the
activity
was
between
july
and
october,
and
most
of
it
was
in
late
october,
and
the
united
states
courthouse
in
richmond
was
much
more
accessible.
mr.
joseph
ryland
winston
he
was
in
jail
in
lieu
of
$30,000
bond.
i
filed
a
supplemental
brief
monday
to
inform
the
court
that
his
incarceration
status
had
changed.
he
had
a
previously
suspended
imposition
of
sentence
on
another
felony
charge
from
1977
or
'79,
and
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
why
that
suspension
should
not
be
revoked,
alleging
as
the
sole
ground
the
offenses
for
which
he
is
awaiting
trial
and
to
which
the
surgery
in
this
case
relates,
and
they
had
the
hearing.
mr.
watkinson
testified.
sentence
was...
suspension
was
revoked,
and
now
he
is
doing
a
ten-year
term
in
the
virginia
penitentiary.
thank
you.
