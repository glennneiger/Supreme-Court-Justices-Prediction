justice
o'connor
mr.
garrett,
on
the
same
point,
do
you
think
that
as
the
intrusion
in
the
body
becomes
greater
to
recover
the
bullet,
that
the
corresponding
need
of
the
state
for
the
evidence
should
be
greater
in
order
to
justify
taking
it?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
state's
need
for
the
evidence
should
be
greater
to
justify
taking
it
out
as
it
gets
more
difficult
to
remove?
justice
o'connor
mr.
garrett,
do
you
propose,
then,
that
the
standard
of
reasonableness
is
whether
it
is
minor
surgery
or
not?
justice
o'connor
that
isn't
your
test
then,
whether
it
is
minor
surgery?
justice
o'connor
yes,
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
i
am
just
wondering
what
your
test
is.
justice
o'connor
so
you
don't
propose
that
minor
surgery
be
the
standard?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
you
have
an
eye--
--in
the
schmerber
case,
wasn't
the
blood
in
a
position
analogous
to
the
bullet
here?
that
is,
there
was
other
evidence
in
schmerber
of
intoxification.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
winston,
now,
in
schmerber,
when
the
blood
test
was
authorized,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
extent
that
the
state
needed
the
evidence
was
a
factor,
is
there?
justice
o'connor
it
just
said,
if
the
evidence
is
relevant,
it
can
be
obtained
by
means
of
the
blood
test.
there
wasn't
really
a
consideration
of
need.
when
does
the
state's
need
for
the
evidence
become
a
factor
then?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
wasn't
it
a
factor
in
schmerber,
which
also
involved
some
degree
of
pain
and
discomfort,
i
assume.
justice
o'connor
well,
if
it
was,
it
wasn't
articulated,
was
it?
justice
o'connor
over
and
above
that,
isn't
there
an
obligation
on
the
prosecution
to
come
forward
with
evidence
that
is
exculpatory
as
well
as
inculpatory,
and
that
if
the
ballistics
test
didn't
bear
out,
or
if
they
showed
that
it
was
not
the
same
gun,
your
man
would
walk
out,
wouldn't
he?
justice
o'connor
are
you
suggesting
that
if
he
thought
it
would
help
him,
he
might
have
the
operation?
justice
o'connor
mr.
winston,
you
concede,
do
you,
that
the
evidence
of
your
client's
refusal
to
allow
the
bullet
to
be
retrieved
can
come
into
evidence
against
him?
justice
o'connor
you
would
not
equate
it,
then,
with
admission
into
evidence
of
a
refusal
to
have
a
blood
alcohol
test?
