justice
marshall
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
lyons
v.
oklahoma?
justice
marshall
a
coerced
confession,
and
a
voluntary
one
followed,
and
the
voluntary
one
was
held
perfectly
valid
by
this
court.
justice
marshall
in
the
lyons
case,
the
facts
in
there
were
about
as
bad
as
you
can
get.
they
beat
that
man
with
three
different
kind
of
blackjacks.
they
had
ordinary
blackjacks,
a
special-made
blackjack,
and
a
"nigger-beater"
blackjack.
and
they
beat
on
him
in
teams
for
three
days.
you
can't
get
much
more
coercive
than
that.
justice
marshall
and
they
admitted
the
second
confession.
justice
marshall
you've
got
to
show
that
the
tree
is
more
poisonous
than
most
trees?
justice
marshall
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
marshall
well,
that
may
be--
justice
marshall
did
he
testify?
justice
marshall
well,
what
are
you
telling
us
about
what
was
in
his
mind
just
out
of
the
clear
blue?
justice
marshall
you've
been
talking
about
what
was
in
his
mind--
justice
marshall
--but
that's
your
testimony.
justice
marshall
don't
put
me
in
now.
i
wasn't
there.
justice
marshall
counsel,
you've
been
arguing
it
for
15
or
more
minutes,
and
i
warned
you
10
minutes
ago.
are
you
ever
going
to
get
to
any
other
part
of
this
argument
than
what
has
already
been
agreed
on?
