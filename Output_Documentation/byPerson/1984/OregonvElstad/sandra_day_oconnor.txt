justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
mcmann
case
has
some
bearing
on
this
discussion,
does
it
not,
where
even
a
misunderstanding
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
as
to
his
initial
confession
did
not
invalidate
his
subsequent
guilty
plea?
justice
o'connor
what
if
there
were
a
causal
connection
between
the
second
statement
and
the
first
unwarned
statement?
what
would
your
position
be
then?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
second
confession
were
voluntary,
but
the
first
is
coerced
do
you...
what
action
should
be
taken?
is
it
a
due
process
problem
or
a
fifth
amendment
problem?
justice
o'connor
is
it
your
position
that
that
much,
that
incident
you
described,
was
a
violation
in
and
of
itself
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
o'connor
so
you
think
that
the
miranda
warning
requirement
is
constitutionally
mandated
in
other
words?
justice
o'connor
despite
the
language
in
the
court's
opinion
in
quarrels
in
other
cases
to
the
effect
that
it's
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
didn't
that
case
hold
that
the
prosecution
need
not
show
that
a
person
who
consents
to
a
search
knew
that
he
could
refuse?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
mcmann,
where
the
defendant
didn't
know
that
his
confession
was
inadmissible,
and
yet
he
was
allowed
to
enter
a
valid
guilty
plea
without
understanding
the
effect
of
his
confession?
justice
o'connor
yes,
he
did.
justice
o'connor
--it
has
been
conceded
that
we
treat
this
case
as
though
he
were
in
custody
when
the
first
statement
was
made.
it
makes
no
difference.
we
concede
that.
that's
the
starting
proposition.
there
was
a
miranda
violation
in
failing
to
warn
for
the
first
statement.
don't
we
start
there
in
deciding
this
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
we're
dealing
with
what
the
parties
have...
how
the
parties
have
framed
the
issues,
and
it
certainly
would
be
my
understanding
that
the
starting
point
is
to
say,
okay,
a
miranda
warning
should
have
been
given
in
the
living
room
before
the
officer
said,
"do
you
know
these
people,
were
you
there?
"
justice
o'connor
well,
you're
arguing
for
a
new,
more
extensive
miranda
rule.
you
just
want
it
expanded
to
require
an
additional
warning
to
be
given;
right?
justice
o'connor
well
now,
wait
a
minute.
in
the
face
of
michigan
v.
tucker
and
quarrels,
how
can
you
say
it's
a
constitutional
violation
to
ask
a
defendant
something
without
a
miranda
warning?
it's
a
failure
to
give
the
prophylactic
miranda
warning,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
it's
not
a
constitutional
violation,
is
it,
to
ask
someone
something
without
the
miranda
warning...
if
it's
determined
to
be
essentially
voluntary
and
not
coercive?
justice
o'connor
yes,
right.
it
violates
the
miranda
rule.
justice
o'connor
well,
how
can
you
say
that
in
the
face
of
michigan
v.
tucker
and
quarrels?
