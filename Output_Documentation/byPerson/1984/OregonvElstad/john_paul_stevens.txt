justice
stevens
general
frohnmayer,
may
i
ask
about
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
after
the
miranda
warnings
were
given?
i
gather
the
standard
of
voluntariness
is
whether
he
made
a
knowing
waiver
of
his
constitutional
right
not
to
speak
at
all.
justice
stevens
now,
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that
he
knew
that
the
first
statement
would
be
inadmissible
if
it
were
offered
in
trial?
justice
stevens
in
order
for
it
to
be
voluntary,
i
suppose
he
ought
to
have
the
same
degree
of
knowledge
as
if
he
had
the
advice
of
counsel.
wouldn't
you
say
that's
right?
justice
stevens
i
suppose
counsel
would
have
told
him,
if
he
had
counsel
available,
that
that
first
confession
is
not
admissible
and
now
you
decide
whether
you
want
to
confess
or
not.
but
he
didn't
know
that,
did
he?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
his
second
confession
would
be
equally
voluntary,
whether
or
not
he
knew
that
the
first
confession
of
first
inculpatory
statement
would
be
inadmissible?
justice
stevens
you
do?
even
if
he
thought
it
was
admissible,
and
he
acted
on
that
assumption,
you'd
still
say
it
was
a
perfectly
voluntary
confession.
justice
stevens
why
wouldn't
that
be
true
if
they
actually
physically
assaulted
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
arrest?
why
wouldn't
that
still
be
true?
why
shouldn't
the
miranda
warning
always
insulate
the
second
confession
under
your
submission?
justice
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
the
proper
balance
between...
i
don't
understand
what
that
means.
justice
stevens
but
why
isn't
the
miranda
warning
always
sufficient
to
do
that?
i
don't
understand...
it
seems
to
me
there
is
some
inconsistency
in
your
position.
isn't
it
true
that
if
you
assume
that
the
first
statement
was
a
violation
of
miranda,
you
must
be
assuming
it
was
presumptively
coercive?
and
why
is
a
presumption
of
coercion
any
different
than
actual
beating?
justice
stevens
i
simply
don't
understand
the
difference
between
the
two
cases
under
your
submission.
maybe
i'm
just
stupid,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
that's
very
helpful.
it
really
is,
because
i
think
perhaps
the
case
boils
down
to
this
colloquy
with
justice
o'connor;
is
whether
a
miranda
violation
is
actually
a
constitutional
violation,
or
is
it
merely
some
kind
of
court-made
rule
that
does
not
amount
to
that?
and
i
must
confess
that
if
it's
not
a
constitutional
violation,
i
don't
know
where
this
court
ever
had
the
power
to
set
aside
any
state
conviction
on
the
ground
that
they
didn't
follow
a
rule
we
thought
it
would
be
a
good
rule.
it
seems
to
me,
analytically,
it
must
be
a
constitutional
violation
or
else
we
have
no
business
in
this
area
at
all.
justice
stevens
well,
see,
my
problem
is,
if
you
regard
it
as
a
constitutional
violation,
then
you
have
some
difficulty,
at
least
it
seems
to
me,
saying
that
it's
any
different
from
point
of
view
of
shifting
burdens
and
causation
and
all
that,
between
this
case
and
one
in
which
the
man
was
actually
physically
beaten,
because
in
either
event
it's
the
same
constitutional
violation.
but
if
you
say,
as
justice
o'connor
suggests,
that
it's
really
not
a
constitutional
violation,
it's
kind
of
a
second-class
wrong,
then
there's
integrity
in
your
argument.
justice
stevens
that's
not
correct.
that's
too
much,
because
they
could
always
get
him
a
lawyer.
they
could
always
fix
it.
i
know
they
never
do
as
a
practical
matter,
but
they
could
easily
fix
it
by
saying
we'll
get
you
a
lawyer
before
you
give
us
your
second
confession.
justice
stevens
but
i
don't
think
you
can
say
it's
totally
unfixable.
