justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
think
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
meant
when
it
used
the
phrase
"the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag?
"
justice
rehnquist
supposing
that
he
had
been
arrested
in
the
sense
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave,
and
three
hours
later
they
told
him
that
they
had
a
warrant
for
his
arrest,
and
only
then.
would
you
say
he
hadn't
been
arrested
up
until
the
time
they
told
him
they
had
a
warrant?
justice
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
that
he
was
arrested
when
he
came
from
the
bedroom.
you're
suggesting
that
the
warrant
wasn't
executed
at
that
time
because
they
didn't
state
to
him
that
"i
have
a
warrant
for
your
arrest?
"
justice
rehnquist
mr.
babcock,
strictly
speaking,
the
"i
was
there"
statement
was
never
offered,
was
it?
justice
rehnquist
so
when
you
say
he
hasn't
been
given
an
opportunity
to
object
to
the
use
of
that
statement,
that
statement
was
never
used
against
him.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
are
you
suggesting
by
kind
of
negative
implication
from
schneckloth
v.
bustamonte
that,
although
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
that
a
person
be
told
he
has
a
right
to
consent
before
something
is
admissible,
to
refuse
consent...
somehow,
the
fifth
amendment,
you
cannot
show
consent
unless
you
have
affirmatively
told
the
person
that
his
prior
confession
cannot
be
used
against
him?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
our
court
has
never
adopted
such
a
rule
as
a
per
se
rule.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
gave
the
impression
it
was
laying
down
a
rule
broader
than
just
this
case,
i
thought.
