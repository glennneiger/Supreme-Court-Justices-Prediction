mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
requires
close
analysis
of
an
extraordinary
conclusion
of
a
lower
court.
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
used
an
extreme
extension
of
the
miranda
doctrine
to
suppress
a
fully-advised,
utterly
voluntary,
and
clearly
cuspirating
confession
of
guilt.
that
court
applied
a
per
se
exclusionary
rule
because
of
an
earlier
marginal
violation
of
the
outer
perimeters
of
the
miranda
doctrine.
this
circumstance
gives
rise
to
a
question
which
this
court
has
never
faced
squarely
before.
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
a
burglary
following
a
full
confession
of
his
complicity.
the
signed
confession
was
scrupulously
preceded
by
miranda
advice
and
by
oral
and
written
waivers
of
all
rights,
including
the
right
to
remain
silent.
defendant
declared
and
exercised
his
desire
to
give
a
full
accounting
of
his
involvement
in
the
burglary,
and
the
validity
of
his
waiver
was
never
challenged.
yet,
at
trial,
the
defendant
sought
unsuccessfully
to
suppress
this
fully
voluntary
confession
on
the
basis
of
an
earlier
limited
admission
which
had
not
been
preceded
by
miranda
advice
which
suggested
his
presence
at
the
crime
scene.
the
trial
court
expressly
found
that
the
full
confession
was
voluntary
and
that
it
was
not
tainted
by
his
earlier
limited
statement.
this
case
is
before
this
court
only
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
oregon
accepted
defendant's
theory
that
a
per
se
rule
of
exclusion
should
govern
the
second
statement
and
render
it
invalid
because
the
"cat
was
out
of
the
bag.
"
to
suppress
the
confession
in
this
case
is
not
only
without
basis
in
the
fifth
amendment,
it
is
fundamentally
itself
disrespectful
of
the
importance
and
desired
effect
of
the
required
miranda
warnings
fashioned
by
this
court
nearly
two
decades
ago.
there
is,
in
fact,
no
evidence
on
this
record
of
a
connection
between
the
two
statements.
the
court
of
appeals
used
no
legal
analysis
to
establish
it,
and
instead
applied
a
metaphor
as
a
substitute
for
reasoning.
the
"cat
out
of
the
bag"
metaphor
is
born
of
a
context
clearly
different
than
that
utilized
in
this
case
because
it
was
born
from
the
involuntary
or
coerced
confession
cases.
when
the
violation
at
stake
is
a
miranda
violation,
the
metaphor
is
psychologically
simplistic,
does
not
do
justice
to
the
facts
or
analysis
of
this
case,
it
will
not
work
a
proper
result,
it
disables
the
police
from
correcting
mistakes,
it
imposes
excessively
high
cost
without
deterring
police
misconduct
or
improper
practices,
and
it
undervalues
the
importance
of
miranda
warnings
as
well
as
the
central
core
of
informed
consent
which
we
believe
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
the
metaphors
of
the
court
are
inadequate
to
provide
guidance
because
under
a
proper
analysis,
and
even
pursuing
the
metaphor
further,
there
is
no
evidence
that
"cat"
was
ever
"in
the
bag
at
all".
there's
no
evidence
that
the
defendant
really
meant
to
or
wanted
to
keep
quiet.
there
is
no
evidence
of
compulsion
which
got
in
the
way
of
his
intention
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
it
was
not
a
full
confession.
it
was
a--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that
is
correct.
an
acknowledgment
which
is
ambiguous
in
the
sense
that
it
could
mean
that
the
individual
was
a
witness
to,
rather
than
a
participant
in
the
crime.
in
any
event,
it
is
a
far
cry
from
earlier
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
in
which
a
later
confession
is
admitted,
even
though
the
earlier
statement
is
far
more
indicative
of
complicity.
for
example--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--we
think
that
it
simply
misapplied
the
analysis
that
should
apply
to
these
cases.
we
believe
that
it
used
a
figure
of
speech
as
a
substitute
for
evidence
of
causation.
even
having
done
so,
however,
it's
clear
from
this
court's
decision,
that
causation
is
only
one
condition
under
which
one
suppresses
evidence,
and
one
still
must
have
a
fruit
where
deterrence
justifies
suppression
as
opposed
to
admitting
highly
probative
evidence.
the
second
thing,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
believed
that
this
bore
on
the
defendant's
waiver,
the
voluntariness
of
the
waiver.
but
that
conclusion,
if
that's
what
the
court
meant,
flies
in
the
face
of
an
explicit
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
there
was,
in
fact,
no
taint,
no
connection
between
the
two
statements,
and
that
the
defendant's
conclusion
was
fully
voluntary.
it
shows,
in
short,
the
worst
possible
example
that
we
could
bring
to
this
court
of
a
metaphor
substituting
itself
for
legal
reasoning,
suggesting
on
one
hand
perhaps
the
existence
of
coercion,
which
is
this
record
doesn't
show,
or
suggesting
the
invalidity
of
a
waiver,
or
suggesting
causation
which
no
record
evidence
otherwise
would
demonstrate
between
the
existence
of
the
first
limited
statement
and
the
second.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
there's
nothing
to
show
that
he
knew
that
the
first
amendment
bore
on
anything
he
was
to...
that
the
first
admission
bore
on
anything
that
he
would
say,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
not
necessarily.
all--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--no.
but
his
right
to
exercise
the
advice
of
his...
to
invite
the
presence
of
counsel...
is
clearly
given
to
him
in
the
course
of
the
miranda
warnings.
he
also
has
the
right
not
to
have
counsel
present.
if
that
is
true
under
the
sixth
amendment,
it's
clearly
true
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
in
those
cases
where
the
police
may
not
know
that
there's
anything
with--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--yes,
we
do.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
we'd
say
that
it
could
be
voluntary.
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
he
had
any
knowledge
of
or
that
his
first
admission
bore
on
his
decision
to
make
the
second
full
confession
in
any
event.
and
i
think
some
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
to
which
i'll
come
in
just
a
moment
would
further
demonstrate
that
point.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
it
was
not.
the--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
the
miranda...
i
don't
know
that
it
was
conceded
so
much
because
the
prosecution
never
sought
to
admit
the
first
statement,
justice
white.
in
other
words,
the
legality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
clearly,
if
there
was
no
custody,
there
would
have
been
no
miranda
violation.
but
the
point
is,
the
defendant
only...
the
prosecution
did
not
introduce
the
first
statement
in
the
course
of
this
trial.
and
in
the
second,
it's
only
that
the
defendant
challenged
not
the
first
statement,
but
the
second
statement
because
of
the
allegation
not--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--i
believe
that
that's
the
state
of
the
record
to
which
we're
bound
at
this
point.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
and,
in
fact,
it's
a
very
central
factor,
justice
burger,
because
if
one
is
to
look
at
the
circumstances
objectively
surrounding
the
conditions
under
which
this
confession
were
offered,
it
reeks
of
voluntariness
by
the
defendant
or
at
least
the
conditions
which
give
rise
to
the
ultimate
full
confession
may
bear
on
circumstances
entirely
removed
from
police
conduct.
he
was
not
in
custody
at
his
own
home.
his
mother
was
present
when
he
was
first
briefly
questioned
by
the
officers.
he
had,
in
essence,
a
verbal
altercation
with
his
father
in
which
his
father
reprimanded
him,
and
that
was
immediately
before
he
was
transferred
to
the
station
house
by
yet
another
officer
who
was
not
present.
and,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
dunaway
case,
perhaps
under
these
circumstances
the
fact
that
one
has
just
visited
a
minister
is
far
more
important
in
the
elicitation
of
a
full
confession
than
is
any
activity
of
the
police.
we
think
that
fact
is
a
very
central
and
important
one.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
i
think
the
patrimony
of
the
v.
united
states
in
about
1947.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
interestingly
enough,
in
a
contest,
it
is
always
bayer
that
is
cited
for
the
proposition,
but
what
is
seldom
realized
is
that
the
second...
the
ultimate
confession
was
found
admissible
in
the
bayer
case.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
but
it
doesn't
control
this
case.
and
since
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
one
of
our
central
propositions,
let
me
suggest
why
it
does
not.
first,
because
it
deals
only
with
the
causation
factor.
we
contend
that,
in
fact,
there
is
no
causation
in
this
case
and
that
relates
to
my
response
to
justice
burger...
chief
justice
burger's
question
about
the
intervention
of
the
father's
anger.
but,
second,
even
if
there
is
causation,
that
is,
a
relationship
between
the
first
admission
and
the
second
confession,
that
does
not
perpetually
disable
the
accused
from
confessing.
and
the
reason
that
it
doesn't
is
dealt
with
in
the
bayer
case.
now,
bear
in
mind
a
crucial
distinction
here
because
it's
central
to
our
argument
and
i
wish
to
reiterate
it.
that
is,
that
the
bayer
case
and
the
darwin
case
in
its
progeny
dealt
with
coerced
confessions.
they
dealt
with
involuntary
confessions.
they
dealt
with
a
set
of
circumstances
in
which
the
individual
is
not
free
under
his
own
concept
of
self-determination
voluntarily
to
come
forward
and
waive
a
fifth
amendment
right.
that
is
not
and
cannot
be
the
case
in
a
situation
where
the
violation
is
of
the
prophylactic
rules
that
surround
the
miranda
case,
because
in
that
case
it
is
at
best
a
presumption
of
police
coercion,
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
warnings
to
dispel.
so
we
understand
the
meaning
of
the
bayer
case
to
be
simply
this:
that
in
order
for
the
second
confession
to
be
admissible
and
usable
against
the
defendant,
those
conditions
which
gave
rise
to
the
illegality
must
be
cured
in
some
form
or
another.
in
the
case
of
coerced
confessions
or
involuntary
confessions,
it's
not
surprising
that
this
court's
previous
decisions
suggest
that
the
way
to
cure
it
is
some
lapse
of
time
or
some
distance
in
circumstances
or
some
release
from
custody,
because
those
are
the
kinds
of
situations
that
would
cure
an
actual
atmosphere
of
duress
or
coercion.
but
where,
as
in
this
case,
the
constitutional
violation
that
exists
lies
in
the
failure
to
give
the
miranda
warnings
such
as
the
individual
has
not
been
restored
to
his
ability
to
make
an
informed
decision
about
waiver,
then
the
cure
for
the
violation,
if
it
exists
and
if
it
in
fact
might
have
caused
the
second
confession,
is
the
giving
of
the
miranda
warnings
and
a
full
and
valid
waiver
after
those
warnings,
because
the
presumption
then
is
that
the
illegal
condition,
the
illegal
thing,
has
been
removed.
so
we
believe
that,
in
fact,
the
flaw
of
the
"cat
out
of
the
bag"
metaphor
is,
first
of
all,
its
origins
in
the
coerced
confession
cases
and
the
failure
of
subsequent
lower
courts
in
this
nation
to
recognize
that
other
conditions
may
arise.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
it
is
always
a
possibility
that
a
defendant's
confession
can
be
induced
by
things
which
he
either
knows
or
may
believe
that
the
police
know
about
him.
in
this
case,
elstad
clearly
knew
that
the
police
had
an
arrest
warrant,
and
were
he
aware
of
the
law,
would
have
to
have
understood
that
from
independent
evidence,
not
out
of
his
mouth,
the
police
possessed
sufficient
information
for
probable
cause
to
detain
him.
i
believe
this
court
has
never
required
that
in
the
course
of
securing
a
valid
confession,
that
the
defendant
must
have
been
in
full
possession
of
all
knowledge
as
to
what
a
trial
court
or
an
appellate
court
would
later
ratify
as
having
been
validly
admissible
items
of
evidence
against
that
particular
defendant.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
i
mean
i
think
it's
the
same
principle,
justice
o'connor,
which
is
that
this
court
has
never
in
the
case
of
testimonial
evidence...
and
correctly
so...
required
trial
court
or
prosecutors
or
police
to
insert
themselves
in
the
mind
of
the
defendant
and
examine
all
possibilities
and
motivations
of
human
conduct
which
give
rise
to
that
testimonial
evidence.
in
fact,
we
understand
that
to
be
one
of
the
central
thrusts
of
the
ceccolini
case
in
connection
with
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
one
should
ordinarily
admit
testimonial
evidence
which
is
voluntary,
or
not
admit
it.
and
the
thrust,
we
take
it,
is
that
no
one
can
understand
or
expect
to
put
himself
or
herself
in
the
mind
of
the
defendant.
there
might
be
an
exception
to
that.
if
the
defendant
were
to
have
affirmatively
testified
on
his
motion
to
suppress
as
to
the
overbearing
impact,
but
there
is
no
such--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--our
position
as
to
the
conclusion
of
the
case
would
be
the
same,
for
this
reason:
that
in
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
cases,
this
court
has
always
said
that
there
is
a
two-part
analysis.
causation
is
only
the
beginning
of
the
inquiry.
if
there's
not
causation,
there's
a
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
problem
and
there's
never
a
voluntariness
problem.
and
we
contend
in
this
case,
as
we've
tried
to
demonstrate,
that
there
is,
in
fact,
no
causation,
but
even
if
there
were,
that
does
not
answer
the
wong
sun
problem
in
the
fourth
amendment
context,
or
at
least
analogously
here,
which
is
does...
is
the
value
of
deterrence
of
illegal
conduct
such
that
the
statement
should
be
suppressed,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
bears
some
relationship
to
an
earlier
admission
or
confession
of
a
defendant?
and
so
to
suppress
evidence
purely
on
a
causation
theory
alone,
elusive
as
that
is
to
find
in
the
case
of
testimonial
evidence
where
people
under
their
free
will
act,
is
to
ignore
the
essential
test
that
this
court
has
adopted.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
oh,
if
the
first
statement
were
coerced,
that
would
raise
a
very
different
problem.
that
would--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--because
that
would
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
the
miranda.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
but
that's
squarely
within
the
thrust
of
the
westover
case,
the
companion
case
to
miranda,
where
the
waiver
of
the
miranda
warning
is
invalid
because
the
defendant...
the
effects
of
the
first
confession
had
not
warn
off
before
the
second.
and
so
it
goes
then
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
second
confession.
in
this
case,
neither
the
first--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--it
could
be
both,
justice
o'connor,
but
we
take--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--lyons
v.
oklahoma
is...
well,
we
believe--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--but
the
lyons
case,
the
bayer
case,
and
the
westover
case,
the
companion
case
to
miranda,
are
not
successive
statement
cases
in
the
sense
that
we
are
dealing
with
here.
they
are
coerced
confession,
involuntary
circumstances
case
and
the
analysis--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--i
think
that
one
can
say
that,
and
i
think
that
that's
the
analysis--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--voluntariness
of
the
second...
yes,
because
that's
the
only
one
that's
admitted.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
that
may
point
up
perhaps
a
slight
difference
between
the
position
taken
by
the
state
of
oregon
and
that
taken
by
the
united
states
in
this
case,
which
is
the
position
just
advanced
as
a
hypothetical
by
yourself,
justice
white.
and
the
question
is,
i
suppose,
this:
is
there...
because
it
is
or
perhaps
might
be
a
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
problem...
is
there
any
set
of
circumstances
so
egregious
involving
the
securing
of
the
first
illegal
confession
or
statement,
that
the
subsequent
confession,
although
voluntary
in
the
traditional
sense,
ought
to
be
suppressed
for
reasons
of
deterring
police
misconduct.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
agree
with
that,
justice
marshall,
and--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--our
view
is
that
in
light
of
the
westover
case,
decided
subsequently
to
lyons,
that
it's
questionable
whether
this
court
would
stand
for
that
at
any
time.
and
let
me
suggest
that
in
passing...
it
was
either
justice
rehnquist
or
justice
o'connor
suggested
that
there
may
be
some
other
constitutional
provision
that
would
bear
on
the
admissibility
of
that
kind
of
circumstance.
that
might
well
be,
instead
of
a
fifth
amendment
problem,
it
may
well
be
a
pure
due
process
problem
arising
some
out
of
some
other
constitutional
provision
that
independently
would
prohibit
the
courts
from
giving
dignity
to
the
continued
prosecution
of
a
defendant
who
had
been
maltreated
under
those
circumstances?
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
it
might
have
cured
it
at
the
peril,
perhaps,
of
creating
a
mischief
worse
than
that
gratuitous
piece
of
police
legal
advice
might
have
created.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
we
think
it
might
well
do
a
great
deal
of
mischief,
because
it
confuses
the
role
of
the
police
officer
with
that
of
the
criminal
defense
lawyer,
first.
second,
it
may
involve
the
police
in
second-guessing
their
own
conduct.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
it
could
well
confuse
the
defendant.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
in
the
limited
sense,
yes.
but
this
court
has
always
asked
for
bright
line
rules
in
the
miranda
context,
and
we
believe
to
create
another
gloss
on
the
miranda
doctrine
which
would
suggest
that
in
cases
where
police
are
in
doubt
as
to
the
admissibility
of
any
evidence
with
which
they
confront
defendant,
that
they
add
another
warning
saying,
and
by
the
way,
it
may
not
count...
what
we
now
know...
is
simply
to
create
an
unadministrable
rule.
and
for
that
reason,
we
believe
that
the
miranda
warning
is
fully
adequate
to
cure
the
defect
of
the
failure
to
give
the
miranda
warning,
such
that
the
second
confession
is
fully
allowable.
any
further
gloss
destroys
whatever
bright
line
advantages
the
miranda
rule
has
for
police
agencies
around
this
nation,
and
we
believe
destructively
and
mischievously
so.
we've
argued,
of
course,
that
there
is
in
fact
no
causation
which
gives
rise
to
these
circumstances
in
the
first
place.
we
spoke
to
the
fact
that
the
father
had
be
rated
his
son,
a
condition
which
may
be
far
more
influential
on
this
individual.
we
pointed
out
that--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--absolutely.
absolutely.
causation
is
a
first
precondition,
but
it
is
never
the
determinative
factor.
that's
what
united
states
v.
bayer
established,
we
believe,
as
early
as
1947
by
this
court.
the
key
to
admissibility
is,
first,
you
must
establish
causation
as
a
floor,
but
that's
certainly
not
a
minimal
condition
which
is
also
a
ceiling
on
the
admissibility.
and
we
simply
point
to
the
fact
that
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
ever
showed
that
defendant
was
unwilling
to
talk
to
the
police
officers.
there's
no
indication
of
his
unwillingness
to
volunteer
information.
when
one
compares
his
limited
admission
of
presence
at
the
crime
scene
with
the
full
two-page
confession
that
followed,
including
a
gratuitous
postscript
that
suggested
he'd
received
as
payment
for
his
participation
in
the
crime,
a
baggie
of
marijuana,
it's
clear
that
this
is
not
the
example
of
a
defendant
who
reluctantly
was
brought
to
the
bar
of
justice
or
was
reluctant
to
admit
his
complicity
and
involvement
and
in
these
events.
under
these
circumstances,
the
trial
court
made
a
finding,
the
trial
court
which
heard
the
testimony
of
the
police
officers,
and
which
said
explicitly
that
there
was
no
taint
or
connection
and
said
explicitly
that
the
statement
was
voluntary.
but
even
if,
as
you
have
suggested,
chief
justice
burger,
there
were
some
connection
between
the
first
and
the
second
episodes,
the
miranda
warning
itself
is
sufficient
to
constitute
the
presence
of
an
intervening
factor
which
renders
his
second
confession
fully
voluntary.
if
the
miranda
warning
failure
were
the
violation,
if
it
is
in
fact
the
poison,
the
antidote
to
the
poison
is
the
administration
of
the
miranda
warnings
themselves.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
because
that
may
not
be
enough,
by
itself,
to
indicate
that
the
restoration
or
the
proper
balance
between
the
police
and
the
individual
has
always
been
recreated.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
by
the
proper
balance,
we
take
to
understand
the
meaning
why
the
miranda
warnings
are
given
in
the
first
place,
and
why
this
court
elaborated
that
doctrine
in
1966.
and
it's
this:
the
presumption
of
station
house
coercive...
an
atmosphere
of
coercion
in
the
station
house,
such
that
something
must
be
done
by
police
officers
if
they
wish
to
secure
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
right
not
to
speak,
there
must
be
some
statement
by
official
authority
that
gives
the
individual
a
clear
knowledge
of
his
own
right
to
self-determination.
and
it
is
the
effect
of
the
warnings
to
do
that.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
i
think
that
gets
to
the
point.
the
presumption
of
coercion
is
dispelled
by
giving
of
the
warnings
which
destroy
the
only
thing
that
a
presumption
creates,
and
that's
a
presumption.
where
there's
been
an
actual
beating,
this
court's
precedent
suggests
that
there
must
be
a
more
serious
lapse
of
time
and
change
of
circumstances
to
assure
the
voluntariness
of
the
second
confession.
we
believe
that--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--no,
i
seriously
fail
to
advance
that
contention.
i
would
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
three
points
for
rebuttal.
the
first
is
that
the
issue
of
the
manipulation
of
custody
of
defendant
was
not
argued
below,
nor
does
the
record
support
that
assertion.
defendant
below
simply
argued
that
the
second
confession
had
to
be
suppressed
because
the
first
admission
had
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
it
was
the
"cat
out
of
the
bag"
metaphor
in
psychology.
my
second
point
relates,
justice
stevens,
to
what
i
hope
is
a
more
complete
answer
to
your
question.
that
is,
that
miranda
advice
repairs
a
pure
miranda
defect.
miranda
advice
does
not
necessarily
repair
a
fourth
amendment
defect,
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
trilogy
of
cases
involving
brown
v.
illinois
and
dunaway;
nor
does
it
necessarily
cure
a
case
in
which
there
is
actual
coercion
under
the
fifth
amendment
which
is
a
core
constitutional
violation
as
opposed
to
what
justice
o'connor
was
indicating
in
the
colloquy
with
counsel,
a
violation
of
the
rule
of
miranda.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
except
that
under
either
reading,
this
court
of
appeals
decision
should
be
reversed
because
if
it
is
a
core
constitutional
violation,
the
core
of
the
constitutional
violation
was
cured
by
the
giving
of
the
warrant.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
i
think,
respectfully,
there's
integrity
in
either
case
because
even
before
the
miranda
violation
was...
the
miranda
doctrine
was
violated,
this
court
examined
a
number
of
cases
in
which
there
had
been
an
earlier
coerced
confession
in
which
a
cure
had
been
effected
by
removal
of
the
defendant
from
time
or
place
which
caused
the
recreation
of
the
voluntary
condition
for
the
confession.
here,
where
the
violation
is
at
least
at
the
outer
periphery
of
the
fifth
amendment,
if
it's
there
at
all,
as
opposed
to
your
rule,
compliance
with
the
rule
restores
that
element
of
voluntariness
and
destroys
the
presumption
of
station
house
coercion
which
the
rule
was
meant
to
prevent.
and
that's
the
thrust
of
our
argument,
and
i
believe
responsive
to
your
question.
the
final
point
is
simply
this:
and
that
is,
that
my
colleague
from
the
public
defender's
office
has
mentioned
the
issue
of
deterrence.
and
if
one
turns
that
question
on
its
head
and
looks
to
what
is
being
deterred,
if
this
second,
valid,
voluntary,
trustworthy
confession
is
excluded,
it's
far
more
damaging
than
any
police
conduct
that
might
otherwise
be
deterred
by
throwing
out
everything.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
would
send
a
message
to
the
police
that
if
you
make
a
mistake,
you
can't
fix
it.
it
would
send
a
message
to
the
police
that
if
an
error
has
been
made
in
the
initial
advisal
of
rights
to
the
defendant,
he
is
forever
foreclosed--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
in
this
case
at
least,
the
defendant
did
not
have
the
means
that
required
him
to
have--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--thank
you
very
much.
