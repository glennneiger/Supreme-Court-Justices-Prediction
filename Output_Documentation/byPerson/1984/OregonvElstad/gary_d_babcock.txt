mr.
gary
d.
babcock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
what
police
misconduct
are
we
talking
about
by
way
of
deterrence?
you
are
not
about
to
apply
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
unless
you
find
something
to
deter
by
way
of
police
misconduct.
now,
there
were
two
of
them
in
this
case,
and
i'll
tie
these
directly
to
the
trial,
given
enough
words.
the
first
was
manipulation
of
custody.
and
as
you
know,
you
don't
have
to
advise
under
miranda
until
there's
custody.
the
second...
and
this
is
going
to
be
the
second
part
of
my
argument...
is
the
manipulation
of
elstad's
waiver
in
the
obtaining
of
his
confession.
now,
i've
got
to
go
a
little
slower
here
as
far
as
talking
about
the
particular
record.
this
case
is
very
different
to
me
because
it
has
an
arrest
warrant.
most
of
the
cases
i
deal
with,
we're
talking
about
probable
cause
without
a
warrant,
and
the
police
have
to
do
some
investigation,
justifiably
so,
to
find
probable
cause
before
they
arrest
the
person
and
take
him
downtown.
here,
officers
mcallister
and
burke,
when
they
left
the
station
house,
had
an
arrest
warrant
in
their
back
pocket.
that
meant
two
things:
they
had
probable
cause,
and
they
had
identity.
and
they
both
testified
in
the
transcript
that
they
were
going
to
the
elstad
house
for
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only,
and
that
was
to
arrest
elstad
and
take
him
to
the
police
station.
and
they
get
to
the
house
and
knock
on
the
door.
mrs.
elstad
answers
the
door;
the
police
properly
identify
themselves,
and
they
say
"is
your
boy
home"?
this
is
a
19-year-old
boy,
no
prior
criminal
record.
he's
in
the
bedroom.
so
the
police
officers
proceed
with
the
mother
to
the
bedroom
to
where
the
boy
is
lying
naked,
except
for
a
pair
of
shorts,
on
the
bed
listening
to
a
radio.
two
police
officers,
now
armed
with
a
warrant,
walk
in
and
they
tell
him
to
get
dressed.
now,
we
don't
know
how
long
they
were
in
the
bedroom,
in
elstad's
bedroom,
because
we
don't...
it's
not
in
the
record.
we
know
that
the
warrant
wasn't
executed.
now,
a
very
important
thing
that
comes
up
next,
fact-finding-wise,
as
far
as
custody
goes,
and
also
as
far
as
police
misconduct,
is
after
elstad
gets
his
clothes
on,
burke
takes
elstad
not
to
the
police
car,
but
he
takes
and
isolates
him
in
the
living
room.
and
mcallister
takes
elstad's
mother
and
takes
her
to
the
kitchen.
now,
the
only
advice
that's
given
during
this
stage
of
the
game
is
the
fact
that
mcallister
tells
the
mother,
look
it;
we've
got
this
arrest
warrant,
and
this
is
the
only
time
i
know
of
that
it's
ever
executed
is
on
the
mother.
and
they
say,
we
don't
want
you
to
be
upset
with
these
circumstances.
in
the
meantime,
that's
what
happens
with
the
mother,
and
i
don't
know
where
she
goes,
except
she's
probably
around
when
they
take
him
to
the
police
car.
a
chief
feature
here
again
of
misconduct,
and
we're
getting
to
justice
stevens's
question
very
soon
on
what
happens
at
the
police
station
with
the
waiver...
but
then
the
interrogation
starts.
no
execution
of
the
warrant
by
burke,
but
he
says,
do
you
know
the
victims?
and
the
defendant
admitted,
yes,
he
did.
and
he
said,
i
had
heard
there
was
a
burglary
there.
and
burke
says,
yeah,
and
you
were
involved,
weren't
you?
and
now
this
key
language
of
"i
was
there".
i've
got
to
stop
for
one
moment
and
mention
the
two
things
that
the
solicitor
general
and
the
attorney
general...
positions
they
take.
they
take
two
positions.
one,
they
fire
back
on...
first
of
all,
they
take
the
position
i
was
there
is
like
being
downtown
in
the
first
interstate
bank
on
wednesday
afternoon
in
front
of
the
tellers,
and
there's
hundreds
of
people
in
there.
no.
"i
was
there"
was
equal
to,
in
this
man's
mind,
in
being
in
the
first
interstate
bank
on
sunday
afternoon
in
the
vault.
"i
was
there"
is
equal
to
"i
am
a
burglar".
the
people
that
owned
this
property
were
away.
if
you
said
you
were
in
that
house,
you
were
a
burglar.
so
there's
no
problem
about
it
being
exonerating.
it
was
equal
to
a
confession,
and
i'm
going
to
refer
to
it
as
a
confession
to
make
my
job
easier.
the
second
problem
is
inducement.
the
inducement,
this
causation
factor
that
we're
talking
about.
and
it
has
been
mentioned
here
today
about
this
fact
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proof
here,
not
us;
because
theirs
is
the
constitutional
violation.
now,
the
inducement.
everything's
going
fine
here
with
elstad
and
officer
burke
in
their
discussions
in
the
living
room
until
he
said
"i
was
there",
and
all
of
a
sudden
he's
in
the
police
car
and
downtown
behind
bars.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
under
these
facts,
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
well,
i'll
be
candid
with
you.
i
don't
know
about
that.
i'm
saying
that
when...
let
me
say
this
in
answer
to
your
question.
there
is
no
duty
by
the
police
officer
to
execute
the
warrant
until
he
takes
it
off
the
shelf
and
he
starts
manipulating
your
custody
requirement.
the
minute
he
starts
manipulating
your
custody
requirement,
miranda
sets
in.
and
that--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--the
only
time
in
the
record--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--the
only
time...
the
only
time...
on
the
record,
this
is
in
the
record...
that
the
warrant
comes
into
play
is
that
officer
mcallister...
this
is
in
the
transcript--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--yes,
they
had
the
warrant.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
well,
they
were
using
it
as
a
backup
in
their
back
pocket.
they
had
a
good
defense
in
case
anybody
challenged
them.
you're
talking
about
this
19-year-old
boy
and
a
mother.
no
one
challenged
their
authority
to
go
in.
i'm
just
telling
you
that
the--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--the
district
attorney
conceded
all
of
this.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
pardon?
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
because
it's
very
important,
as
i
understand
the
times
that
you've
applied
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine,
it's
very
important
to
be
concerned
about
the
prophylactic
or
the
deterrence
value
of
that
rule.
but
number
two
is,
i
haven't
got
there
yet,
it's
very
important
for
you
to
understand
the
posture
of
the
advice
of
rights
that
justice
stevens
is
asking
about.
and
i
want
to
tell
you--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--very
poisonous.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
my
argument
here
is
that
the
manipulation
of
the
warrant
and
the
getting
the
statement
out
of
him
is
tied
right
together
with
the
advice
of
rights
that
was
given
at
the
police
station.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i
think
factually,
that
once
they
took
him
to
the
living
room,
he
was
under
arrest.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
no.
the
first
time
the
arrest
warrant
was
used
was
in
the
kitchen
with
the
mother.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i'm
just
saying
that
it's
important
what's
going
on--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--no.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i
said
that
the
only
time
they
mentioned
the
arrest
warrant
was
with
the
mother--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--factually,
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
he
was
never
told
that.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
arrest
isn't
important,
only
as
it
relates
to
advice.
i
think
i
threw
a
wrench
in
the
machinery.
i'm
only
saying
that
you
can't
manipulate
custody
to
delay
the
giving
of
advice,
and
this
record
will
show
you
that
officers
burke
and
mcallister
delayed
execution
of
the
warrant
so
they
wouldn't
have
to
give
him
miranda
advice.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
no.
i'm
only
answering
the
amicus
brief,
and
i
should
have
said
that.
the
amicus
claims
he
wasn't
under
arrest.
i
should
never
have
mentioned
the
amicus
claim.
i'm
sorry;
i
withdraw
anything
i
said
about
that.
now,
the
problem
gets
sticky
right
here.
they
go
ahead
and
then
the
boy
says,
"i
was
there",
and
then
they
take
him
into
the
police
car
and
take
him
on
downtown.
it's
a
lapse
of
about
45
to
60
minutes,
and
then
they
take
the
miranda
card
and
they
tell
elstad...
nothing
else
exists
in
this
record
to
dispel
any
notion
in
elstad's
head
that
he
had
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
and
said
"i
was
at
the
burglary".
they
read
the
white
card
to
him,
and
it
says
"anything
you
say
can
be
used
against
you.
"
now,
what
does
that
tell
elstad?
that
tells
elstad
that...
or
burke
is
telling
elstad,
hey,
i
can
use
your
statement
at
the
house,
"i
was
there".
this
card
says
anything
you
say
can
be
used
against
you.
so
the
actual
giving
of
the
miranda
advice
compounds
the
problems
with
the
initial
constitutional
violation.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i
don't
dare
use
the
phrase,
but
is
it
"double
entendre"?
is
it
two
meanings?
and
remember,
the
burden
is
on
the
state
here.
i
think
that
it
could
be
interpreted
two
ways.
anything
you
say
in
the
future
can
be
used
against
you,
and
anything
you
say
can
be
used
against
you.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
no.
this
is
all
based
upon
two
police
officers'
testimony.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
well,
i'm
only
arguing
that
until
the
presumption
is
rebutted
by
the
attorney
general's
office,
that
you
can--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--yes.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
well,
i'm
just
saying,
though,
that
when
he
says
"i
was
there",
and
he's
looked
into
the
police
car,
that
you
can,
as
the
judge--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--i'm
saying
that
he
has
no
knowledge
and
he's
induced,
when
he
gets
to
the
police
station,
after
the
cat
has
been
let
out
of
the
bag,
to
go
ahead
and
give
the
full
confession.
so
when
burke
tell
him
that
anything
that
can
be
used
against
him,
without
more,
then
elstad
has
no
choice
but
to
say,
well,
look
it,
let
me
give
you
the
details
on
the
burglary.
and
that's
exactly
what
elstad
does.
now,
here's
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
in
answer
to
justice
stevens's
point;
that
there
is
a
case,
if
i
can
pronounce
it...
and
it's...
let
me
sure
i
get
this
right...
and
it's
schneckloth
v.
bustamonte...
and
there's
a
long
opinion
involving
what
kind
of
waiver
you
have
to
have
for
the
fourth
amendment.
and
five
of
you
agreed
that
it's
more
than
a
voluntary
waiver.
it
has
to
be
an
understanding
intelligent
waiver,
and
that's
the
key...
an
intelligent
waiver.
and
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
says
in
his
brief.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
yes.
and
with
that
case,
there
were
pages
and
pages
coming
to
that
conclusion,
distinguishing
the
fourth
amendment
voluntary
waiver
standard
with
the
more
complex
johnson
v.
zerbst
and
miranda
v.
arizona,
voluntary
plus,
understanding
plus
intelligent
relinquishment
of
a
right.
and
although
that
might
be
dicta
in
a
sense,
that
rule
of
law
was
established
in
johnson
v.
zerbst
and
miranda.
miranda
is
quoted
at
length
in
the
schneckloth
case,
and
there
were
five
of
you
that
joined
with
that
proposition.
it
makes
sense
here,
too.
elstad
today
has
never
been
given
an
opportunity
to
intelligently
object
to
the
use
of
the
statement
"i
was
there"
at
the
home.
there
has
never
yet
been
an
understanding
waiver
of
that
point
as
we
stand
here
arguing
the
case.
and
it
can't
just
be
a
voluntary
fourth
amendment
rule
that
you
apply
here.
there
must
be
something
in
burke's
advice
that--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--no.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
yes.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
that
adopts
the
argument
that
the
statement
where
he
elaborates
on
"i
was
there"
was
a
product,
a
fruit
of
"i
was
there",
because
he
didn't
intelligently...
he
has
never
been
given
the
right
to
intelligently
object
to...
i
think
the
words
were
that
he
was
never
told
that
the
first
statement
was
inadmissible
before
he
confessed.
there
is
a
footnote
to
that
effect
by
justice
blackmun
in
brown
v.
illinois.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
arguing
that
you
have
to
go
beyond
just
voluntary.
there
are
pages--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--this
would
not
be
per
se.
we'd
just
be
saying
that
we've
got
to
have
something
more
than
the
fourth
amendment
type
of
waiver.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i
think
the
court
of
appeals...
i
differ
from
what
the
attorney
general
says
about
that
case.
i
think
the
attorney
general
was
applying
a
two-pronged
test,
and
i
haven't
got
it
here
for
presentation,
but
it
goes
with
the
idea
of
presumption
of
involuntariness
that
arise,
and
of
time
being
factors.
it
also
talks
about
intelligence.
and
although
they
don't
cite
bustamonte...
they
don't
even
cite
johnson
v.
zerbst.
i
had
always
wondered
myself,
what
was
the
difference
between
a
fourth
amendment
waiver
and
a
fifth
amendment
waiver
like
we
have
today.
and,
believe
me,
justice
stewart's
opinion
spells
it
out
in
fine
detail.
there
was
an
issue
about
habeas
corpus
from
which
three
of
you
joined
that
part
of
it.
i
think
justice
white
had
joined
justice
stewart
in
trying...
i'm
sure
you
could
call
it
dicta.
but
it
was
very
important
to
define
what
these
valuable
waiver
rights
were,
to
define
the
fourth
amendment
right.
and
i
am
certainly
not
an
expert
on
what's
point
of
law
and
what's
dicta.
it's
good
here,
though,
because,
you
see,
it
points
up
the
fact
that
elstad
never
had
the
slightest
idea
what
was
going
on.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
did
he
have
a
lawyer?
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
well,
i
don't
know
anything
about
that
case,
but
i
would
say
that
there
you've
got
good
attenuation.
understand
now,
we've
got
40
or
50
minutes
just
lapsing
by
here,
and
bang,
"i
was
there",
bang,
i'll
give
you
the
details.
and
you've
got
to
have,
to
have
the
intelligent
waiver
concept
have
any
meaning,
it
would
seem
to
me
there
is
true
attenuation
here.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i
don't
know
enough
about
that
case,
your
honor,
except
i
would
only
say
that
at
some
point,
when
you're
able
to
conclude
from
the
record...
and
this
is
a
very
rare
case...
you
won't
be
able
to
do
it
in
most
instances...
that
there
is
custody
and
that
advice
should
be
given--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--and
was
that
for
the
officer's
protection?
i
would
say
that
most
certainly,
under
those
kinds
of
circumstances,
if
you're
doing
it
to
protect
the
police
officers
or
whatever,
you've
sort
of
got
every
case
with
its
own
facts.
i
find
something,
i've
never
run
into
this
kind
of
case
before
where
police
have
a
warrant
they
never
execute,
and
i'm
only
arguing--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--they
never
executed
the
warrant.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
well,
but
that
kept
them
from
giving
advice.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i'm
sorry.
what?
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
without
advice.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i
noted
you
agree
that
there
was
an
arrest.
i
thought,
in
coming
here,
we
maybe
had
to
argue
that
point.
but--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--no,
it
hasn't,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i'm
sorry,
your
honor:
the
amicus
brief
didn't.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
total
agreement.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
the
solicitor
general's,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
well,
i
think
there's
only
two
arguments,
your
honor.
and
that
is,
to
apply
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
to
prevent
the
police
officers
from
manipulating
custody
so
they
don't
have
to
give
consent;
and
where
you
have
successive
confessions,
and
the
first
confession
is
bad,
that
you
have
advice
that
covers
that
first
confession
and
allows
an
intelligent
waiver
under
johnson
v.
zerbst
and
the
bustamonte
case
and
the
miranda
decision.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
only
where
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--at
the
house?
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
yes.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
but,
see,
there
was
no
advice
given
at
the
house,
your
honor.
and
that
violation--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--and
that's
constitutional.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
well,
michigan
v.
tucker,
i
would
say
i
have
a
difficult
time
with
that,
in
the
sense
i
don't
see
that
as
a
miranda
case,
because
the
man
gave
an
alibi
defense.
the
case
was
handed
down
before,
miranda
v.
arizona;
the
police
were
totally
bona
fide;
in
fact,
they
were
almost
clairvoyant.
they
almost
knew
what
kind
of
advice
to
give.
they
left
out
the
magic
word
"indigent".
and
that
was
the
attorney
general
classifies
as
a
technical
violation.
there
was
no
deterrent
value
to
the
case.
it's
a
case
that's
not,
i
don't
think,
against
us
or
for
us.
it's
a
case
where
it
should
have
been
affirmed
there
was
no
police
misconduct
to
deter.
this
is
a
much
different
case,
as
i've
been
trying
to
explain
in
these
last
few
minutes.
so
tucker
v....
i
don't
think
even
harrison
v.
u.s.,
whether
it
was
reversed,
there
was
any
deterrent
value.
but
the
important
part
is
the
deterrent
value,
and
i
would
not
say
to
expand
miranda;
limit
it
to
an
arrest
warrant
situation
where
the
police
have
obtained
an
improper
confession
in
the
first
instance
and
obtained
the
fruits
of
that
violation,
and
not
given
proper
advice
to
dispel
that
notion.
that's
pure
attenuation.
and
keep
it
very
limited;
i
think
in
most
cases,
the
police
have
to
go
on
in
the
house
and
other
places
and
investigate
and
ask
questions.
in
this
case
they
didn't
have
to
do
so.
thank
you.
