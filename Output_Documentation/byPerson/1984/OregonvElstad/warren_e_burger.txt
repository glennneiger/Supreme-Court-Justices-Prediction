we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
oregon
v.
elstad.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
wouldn't
it
be
more
accurate,
mr.
attorney
general,
perhaps
to
say
there
was
no
cat
let
out
of
the
bag,
because
it
was
not
a
full
confession,
was
it?
chief
justice
burger
it
was
an
acknowledgment
of
presence.
chief
justice
burger
it
may
not
be
important
or
significant
in
any
way,
but
isn't
there
another
factor
here?
didn't
the
boy's...
the
young
man's
father
come
in
and
have
a
talk
with
him
after
the
first
statement?
chief
justice
burger
you
could
assume
for
your
purposes,
i
take
it,
that
the
fact
that
the
cat
had
been
let
out
of
the
bag,
to
a
degree,
assuming
that
there
was
a
cap
involved
there,
and
that
that
circumstances
exerted
some
psychological
influence
on
the
man,
leading
him
to
make
the
second
statement
more
completely,
and
still
stand
on
its
admissibility.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
babcock.
chief
justice
burger
is
there
any
doubt
that
he
was
under
arrest
when
they
took
him
by
the
arm
and
said
get
dressed,
we're
going
down
to
the
station?
chief
justice
burger
you
don't
think
he
had
any
doubt
about
it,
or
anybody
in
the
house
had
any
doubt
about
it?
they
were
certainly
using
their
right
under
the
warrant
then,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
burger
isn't
it
equally
an
interpretation
that
anything
you
say
from
now
on
can
be
used
against
you?
chief
justice
burger
i
notice
you
filed
your
brief
on
june
18th...
at
least
that's
marked.
about
a
week
after
that,
the
court
came
down
with
the
case
involving
the
police
approaching
a
man
who
was
in
a
supermarket
with
an
empty
shoulder
holster
under
his
arm,
and
they
said
where
is
the
gun?
now,
is
this
something
like
"where
is
the
gun"?
"were
you
there"?
or
"where
were
you"?
chief
justice
burger
well,
there
was
pretty
good
custody
in
the
supermarket
because
at
least
one,
perhaps
two
policemen
had
guns
pointed
at
him
when
they
said,
"where
is
the
gun"?
chief
justice

mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
