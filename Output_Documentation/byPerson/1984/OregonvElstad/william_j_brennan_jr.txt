justice
jr.
i
gather
that
the
expression
"cat
out
of
the
bag"
is
not
original
with
the
court
of
appeals
to
argue?
justice
jr.
indeed,
you're
familiar,
i
guess,
with
our
darwin
decision
back
in
391
where
justice
harlan,
if
he
didn't
actually
use
the
expression,
did
say...
as
i
recall
it
in
similar
circumstances...
that
the
problem
with
the
second
confession
is
that
because
of
what
he'd
said
the
first
time,
the
accused
might
think
that
he
had
little
to
lose
by
repetition.
and
in
that
circumstance...
i
think
this
was
justice
harlan...
that
the
state
has
to
bear
the
burden
of
proving
not
only
that
the
later
confession
was
not
itself
a
product
of
coercive
conditions,
but
also
that
it
was
not
directly
produced
by
the
existence
of
the
earlier
confession.
now,
that's
the
"cat
out
of
the
bag"
analysis,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
yes.
i
knew
it
had
a
rather
ancient
origin.
justice
jr.
well,
wasn't
what
justice
harlan
said
in
darwin?
that
was
the
law
at
that
time,
wasn't
it?
justice
jr.
but
it's
still,
too,
isn't
it,
as
justice
stevens
suggested
to
you
earlier,
that
the
accused
might
think...
he
wouldn't
know
that
his
first
statement
was
going
to
be...
was
not
admissible
for
failure
to
give
miranda
violations,
and
he
went
ahead
and
repeated
it
the
second
time
because
he
thought
he
had
nothing
to
lose?
justice
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
getting
back
just
one
second
to
the
"cat
out
of
the
bag"
analysis,
i
take
it
it's
consequences
could
have
been
avoided
here,
at
least
before
they
gave
him
the
second
miranda
warnings,
had
said
to
him,
look,
forget
what
we
said
this
morning;
whatever
you
said
this
morning
will
not
be
admitted
against...
and
then
they
gave
him
warnings,
then
he
went
on
and
made
the
statement.
i
gather
that
would
have
cured
any
taint
under
the
"cat
out
of
the
bag"
analysis,
wouldn't
it?
justice
jr.
my
next
question
was
going
to
be,
i
suppose
you
think
it's
pretty
impractical
to
ask
the
police
to
go
around
saying,
look,
fella,
we
treated
you
badly
this
morning;
forget
it
all
and
we'll
never
offer
that
against
you,
it'll
never
be
admitted.
and
he
said
i
will
start
with
a
clean
slate.
justice
jr.
well,
it
would
cure
the
taint,
wouldn't
it?
justice
jr.
that
still
would
cure
the
taint,
whether
it
confused
him
or
not.
