justice
white
well,
at
trial,
didn't
you
claim
that
there
was
no
custody
at
the
time
of
the
first
statement?
i
know
that
you
don't
claim
that
now,
but
wasn't
it
claimed
at
that
time?
justice
white
so
you
conceded
the
miranda
violation
from
the
outset?
justice
white
my
question
is,
you
wouldn't
have
advised
him
that
the
first
statement
was
inadmissible
because
it
may
have
been
admissible
if
there
was
no
custody.
justice
white
but
we
have
to
proceed
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
miranda
violation
in
the
first
instance
here.
justice
white
well,
what
would
you
say
if
the
first
statement
was
coerced?
that
wouldn't
change
your
analysis
any,
would
it?
justice
white
why
would
it
in
terms
of
your
analysis?
justice
white
there
would
only
be
causation...
you
might
just
that,
arguably,
there
was
causation
then;
that
the
first...
the
threat
of
coercion
carried
over
to
the
second
statement.
justice
white
why
wouldn't
you
say
that
even
if
the
first
statement
is
coerced,
the
second
one
is
admissible
if
you
can
honestly
find
it
to
be
voluntary;
and
hence,
that
the
prior
coercion
didn't
carry
over
and
induce
the
later--
justice
white
--it
wouldn't
be
under
your
analysis,
which
is
voluntariness
of
the
second
statement
is
crucial
to
your
analysis.
justice
white
as
long
as
that's
true,
it
shouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
first
one
is
coerced.
justice
white
don't
you
think
they
really
used
the
warrant?
the
police
are
not
supposed
to
even
go
in
the
house
without
a
warrant
to
arrest
somebody.
justice
white
didn't
they
think
they
had
a
right
to
go
into
the
house
with
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
white
well,
they
wouldn't
have
even
gone
to
the
house
without
the
warrant.
justice
white
well,
i
know.
well,
they
were
using
it
then.
justice
white
the
state
doesn't
challenge
the
fact
that
he
was
in
custody
and
that
there
was
a
miranda
violation
in
the
house.
justice
white
i
don't
know
why--
justice
white
--what's
the
point,
then,
in
going
through
all
of
this?
justice
white
--but
he
was
arrested
when
they
took
him
out
of
his
bedroom.
justice
white
well,
what
did
you
just
say?
justice
white
didn't
you
say
he
was,
in
effect,
under
arrest
when
they
took
him
down
to
the
living
room?
justice
white
well,
all
right.
justice
white
they
executed
it.
they
arrested
him
in
his
bedroom.
justice
white
well,
you
mean
they
never
told
him,
"i
have
a
warrant
for
your
arrest.
"
justice
white
that
may
be,
but
they
nevertheless
arrested
him.
justice
white
they
nevertheless
arrested
him.
justice
white
you
agree
he
was
arrested,
whether
they
referred
to
the
warrant
or
not.
when
they
left
the
bedroom,
he
was
arrested...
from
the
facts.
