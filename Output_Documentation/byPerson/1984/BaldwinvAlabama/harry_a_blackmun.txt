justice
blackmun
mr.
carroll,
has
the
scheme
been
changed
since
that
in
effect
at
the
time
this
all
took
place?
justice
blackmun
and
the
judge
knows
the
system.
he
knows
why
the
verdict
has
been
brought
in.
the
jury
has
to
bring
it.
justice
blackmun
well,
i
think
we
all
recognize
that
it's
a
most
curious
statute,
the
product
of
some
legislator's
convoluted
mind,
i
would
think.
