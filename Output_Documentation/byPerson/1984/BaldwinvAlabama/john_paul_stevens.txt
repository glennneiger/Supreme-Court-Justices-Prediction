justice
stevens
mr.
carroll,
may
i
ask
a
question.
supposing
you
have
a
man
found
guilty.
the
jury
must
say
sentence
him
to
death.
then
you
have
a
separate
sentencing
hearing
before
the
judge,
and
the
prosecutor
says,
i'm
not
going
to
offer
anything
else,
and
the
defendant
offers
nothing
else.
is
it
not
true
that
the
judge
must
then
sentence
him
to
death?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
one
question.
your
brief's
been
very
helpful
in
this
case.
if
the
jury
finds
that
there
was
an
aggravating
circumstance...
in
this
case
i
guess
it
was
robbery,
at
least
it
was
one
of
them,
in
connection
with
the
crime...
and
therefore
it
was
appropriate
to
return,
then
they
must
return
the
death
sentence,
then
if
the
judge
at
the
sentencing
hearing...
whether
you
call
it
a
sentence
or
not,
that's
what
the
verdict
form
says.
but
then
the
judge
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
first
he
has
to
find
out
whether
there
was
in
fact
that
aggravating
circumstance.
and
say
he
finds
it
was.
there's
no
doubt
about
the
fact
robbery
was
present.
and
then
assume
there's
nothing
else
put
into
the
record
except
that
finding.
is
it
not
true
that
on
those
circumstances
as
a
matter
of
law
he
must
impose
the
death
sentence?
justice
stevens
mr.
carnes,
refresh
my
recollection.
did
not
one
of
the
members
of
your
supreme
court
in
one
of
the
dissenting
opinions
make
the
same
argument
to
the
same
effect
as
the
comment
from
the
beck
opinion,
that
there
was
a
kind
of
a
psychological
tendency
to
follow
the
jury
verdict,
even
though
logically
you
don't
have
to?
justice
stevens
do
these
include
cases
that
were
sent
back
after
beck
was
decided?
