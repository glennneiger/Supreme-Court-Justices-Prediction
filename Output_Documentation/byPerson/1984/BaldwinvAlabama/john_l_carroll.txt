mr.
john
l.
carroll
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
brian
keith
baldwin,
is
an
alabama
death
row
inmate
who
was
tried,
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
death
under
the
1975
alabama
death
penalty
law
that
was
the
subject
of
this
court's
opinion.
in
beck
versus
alabama,
this
court
dealt
with
what
came
to
be
known
as
the
lesser
included
offense
provision,
that
is,
the
provision
of
this
statute
which
forbade
the
jury
from
returning
a
verdict
which
would
have
comported
with
a
lesser
included
offense.
today
we
are
before
this
court
to
discuss
the
sentencing
provisions
of
that
particular
statute.
by
way
of
information,
it
would
be
helpful
at
this
point
in
time
to
review
exactly
what
the
statute
says
on
its
face.
a
jury,
upon
deciding
that
a
defendant
is
guilty
of
capital
murder,
under
this
alabama
law
is
mandatorily
required
to
sentence
that
defendant
to
death.
there
is
a
mistrial
provision
which
the
state
relied
on
in
great
measure
to
save
the
defect
this
court
identified
in
beck,
which
allows
a
jury
that
cannot
agree
on
a
verdict
of
guilt
to
return
a
verdict
of
mistrial,
and
also
allows
a
jury
who
cannot
agree
on
a
sentence
of
death
to
return
a
verdict
of
mistrial.
once
the
jury
has
reached
this
decision
that
the
state
has
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
a
defendant
is
guilty
of
capital
murder,
it
mandatorily
sentences
that
defendant
to
death.
the
trial
then
holds
a
sentencing
hearing,
wherein
he
decides
what
the
sentence
ought
to
be.
and
the
statute
specifically
requires
the
trial
judge
to
weigh,
along
with
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
this
mandatorily
imposed
standardless
jury
sentence
of
death,
and
therein
petitioner
contends
lies
the
constitutional
flaw
with
the
alabama
sentencing
scheme.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
it
has,
justice
blackmun.
the
scheme
no
longer
exists
and
has
not
been
utilized
by
the
state
of
alabama
since
1980.
following
the
decision
of
this
court
in
beck
v.
alabama,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
rewrote
this
law
in
a
case
called
beck
versus
the
state.
what
the
rewritten
law
says
is
that
there
are
now
lesser
included
offenses
in
capital
trials
under
the
beck
procedure,
that
the
sentencing
authority
is
the
jury,
that
the
jury
hears
evidence
of
aggravation
and
mitigation
separate
and
apart
from
its
decision
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
and
then,
should
the
jury
return
a
verdict
of
death
in
a
case,
that
verdict
is
then
again
reviewed
by
the
trial
judge.
if
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
that
is
the
sentence
which
is
imposed.
so
the
state
of
alabama
rewrote
the
procedure
to
comport
essentially
with
georgia
and
florida,
and
then
in
1981
the
alabama
legislature
enacted
an
entirely
new
death
penalty
scheme,
again
which
incorporated
in
the
main
the
procedures
of
florida
and
georgia.
again,
the
guilt-innocence
determination
is
separate
from
the
punishment
determination,
and
it
is
a
statute
in
line
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
options
that
the
jury
has
are,
they
may,
if
they
find
that
a
defendant
is
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
capital
murder,
then
they
must
mandatorily
sentence
the
defendant
to
death.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
in
the
same
proceeding,
mr.
chief
justice.
now
we're
talking
about
the
old
law,
the
law
that
is
before
this
court.
the
jury
decides
sentence
and
guilt
in
the
same
proceeding,
and
that
was
again
one
of
the
defects
that
this
court
identified
in
beck,
although
it
did
not
specifically
address
the
constitutionality
of
that
provision.
that
provision
has
since
been
changed
by
both
the
legislature
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
to
comport
with
the
decisions
which
require
guilt,
innocence,
and
punishment
to
be
determined
in
separate
proceedings.
so
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
exactly
correct;
this
procedure
simply
does
not
exist
any
more
and
has
not
been
in
existence
since
december
of
1980,
when
the
alabama
supreme
court
issued
its
opinion
in
beck
versus
the
state.
the
state's
response
to
what
the
petitioner
contends
is
obvious
unconstitutionality
is
in
essence
a
four-pronged
argument.
the
first
prong
of
the
argument,
the
state
tries
to
compare
the
sentencing
process
under
this
statute
with
the
sentencing
processes
under
the
georgia,
texas,
and
florida
schemes
by
saying,
well,
the
sentencing
authority
is
required
to
weigh
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
the
sentencing
authority
is
required
to
sentence
to
death
if
the
aggravating
outweighs
the
mitigating.
all
those
things
are
true,
but
what
that
argument
ignores
is,
this
is
not
the
georgia,
florida,
or
texas
statute,
because
none
of
those
statutes
require
the
sentencing
judge,
as
part
of
the
process
for
determining
whether
a
defendant
lives
or
dies,
to
take
into
account
a
standardless,
unguidelined
and
arbitrary
jury
sentence
of
death
as
a
factor
in
making
that
life
or
death
decision.
so
plainly
the
argument
that
this
is
similar
to
other
statutes
fails,
because
it
plainly
is
not.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
well,
it's
standardless
in
the
sense--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--well,
it
is
but
then
again
it
isn't,
because
it
suffers
from
the
flaws
that
mandatory
death
sentences
have
suffered
from
in
the
past
when
this
court--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--the
judge
does
indeed
have
another
crack
at
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
well,
he
does,
but
then
again
he
doesn't.
you're
referring
to
what
i've
identified
as
the
third
argument
that
the
state
presents,
and
that
is:
look,
everybody
ignores
this
statute.
the
judge
knows
that
it's
a
mandatory
death
sentence,
so
therefore
he
doesn't
take
it
into
account.
and
i
think,
quite
simply,
that
that
argument
is
just
flawed.
what
the
argument
of
the
state
in
essence
is,
we've
got
this
statute
that
everybody
ignores
and
therefore
you
should
hold
it
to
be
constitutional.
let's
take
for
example,
suppose
it
were
not
a
mandatory
jury
sentence
of
death
that
was
at
issue,
but
suppose
the
alabama
statute
said,
in
sentencing
a
defendant
to
death
the
trial
court
must
take
into
account
the
defendant's
race.
if
you
take
the
state's
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion,
all
the
state
would
then
have
to
do
is
come
before
this
court
and
say:
hey,
look,
the
trial
judges
in
alabama
know
that
they
really
shouldn't
take
into
account
that
race
of
the
defendant,
so
you
should
uphold
that
kind
of
a
statute
because
they
really
don't
follow
the
statute.
the
state's
argument
is
an
invitation
for
this
court
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
the
grounds
that
everybody
ignores
it.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i
think
you
are
being
kind
when
you
call
it
curious,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
is
indeed
a
one
of
a
kind.
no
other
state
has
ever
enacted
one
like
it.
no
other
state
every
will.
but
i
think
it's
a
dangerous
precedent
to
set
if
we
say
that,
because
everybody
ignores
it,
it's
constitutional.
i
think
it's
further
compounded
by
the
fact
that
there's
no
indication
that
everybody
ignores
it.
in
fact,
the
specific
legislative
mandate
requires
that
the
judge
take
the
jury
sentence
of
death
into
account
in
weighing
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
another
argument
that
the
state
presents
with
this
court
is
an
argument
that
there
has
been
a
reinterpretation
of
this
statute.
the
state
has
artfully,
ten
years
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
come
up
with
some
reasons
why
this
mandatory
jury
sentence
of
death,
which
is
clearly
aberrational,
is
in
the
sentencing
phase.
and
it
argues
two
points.
it
says
it
serves
a
function
in
that
it
conveys
into
the
sentencing
stage
the
jury's
fact-finding
that
an
aggravating
circumstance
exists;
and
it
also
says,
the
state,
expresses
legislative
policy
that
death
is
appropriate
unless
there
are
mitigating
circumstances
to
outweigh.
well,
the
answer
to
that
argument
is
plainly,
you
don't
need
a
mandatory
jury
sentence
of
death
to
do
that.
under
alabama
law,
a
finding
of
guilt
conveys
to
the
sentencing
stage
the
jury's
fact
finding
that
an
aggravating
circumstance
exists.
so
this
sentence
of
death
exists
over
and
above
that
particular
function,
and
we
can
only
assume
if
the
legislature
put
this
in
the
statute
that
they
meant
that
it
ought
to
have
some
effect.
it's
not
necessary
to
do
what
the
state
says
it
does.
a
simple
finding
of
guilt
would
do
the
same
thing.
and
that's
exactly
the
way
the
statute
operates
now.
a
finding
of
guilt
allows
a
death
penalty
case
to
get
into
the
sentencing
phase,
so
that
the
jury
can
then
decide
whether
the
punishment
ought
to
be
life
or
death.
the
second
argument
is
the
same,
that
it
expresses
this
legislative
policy
that
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment
where
an
aggravating
circumstance
exists,
unless
the
trial
judge
finds
the
mitigating
circumstances
outweigh
it.
and
again,
the
mandatory
jury
sentence
of
death
is
not
necessary
to
perform
that
function.
again,
because
that
language
is
not
necessary
to
perform
any
function
under
the
statute,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
legislature
intended
that
the
trial
judge
do
exactly
what
the
statute
requires
him
to
do,
take
into
account
the
mandatory
jury
sentence
of
death.
had
the
legislature
not
wanted
the
mandatory
statute...
the
mandatory
death
sentence
to
mean
something,
they
would
not
have
included
it
in
the
statute.
and
the
fact
that
they
included
it
in
the
statute
indicates
that
we
cannot
ignore
the
fact
that
it
is
there.
again,
it
is
the
height
of
irony
to
say
that
this
court
should
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
everybody
ignores
its
existence.
finally,
the
appellant...
i'm
sorry.
finally,
the
respondent
raises
the
issue
concerning
the
appellate
review
process
under
the
statute
and,
coupled
with
that,
raises
a
harmless
error
kind
of
argument.
the
appellate
review
process
under
this
particular
statute
is,
as
the
state
describes
it,
very
elaborate.
the
state
goes
into
great
detail
talking
about
this
independent
weighing
of
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
that
exist.
it
goes
on
in
great
detail
about
how
the
appellate
courts
perform
their
function
under
this
statute.
but
when
you
sift
through
all
of
this
verbiage,
you
come
down
to
the
hard,
cold
fact
that
the
alabama
appellate
courts
in
their
history
in
construing
not
only
this
death
penalty
statute
but
the
ones
that
have
come
after
it
have
set
aside
one
death
sentence
based
on
this
independent
weighing
of
aggravating
and
mitigating,
and
that
death
sentence
was
imposed
on
a
20
year
old
retarded
black
man
who
was
a
non-trigger
man
in
the
case,
who
had
an
iq
of
45.
i
think
the
fact
that
he
was
sentenced
to
death
under
this
statute
indicates
how
the
statute
operates
and
the
importance
of
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
takes
into
account
this
mandatory
jury
sentence
of
death.
again--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--no.
if
i
did
say
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
misspoke.
i
was
referring
to
the
one
case
that
the
alabama
appellate
courts
have
set
aside
a
death
sentence
in,
which
is
a
case
styled
lewis
versus
the
state,
where
the
individual
in
that
case
i
believe
was
the
non-trigger
man
and
had
an
iq
of
45.
again,
though,
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
an
appellate
weighing
process
is
not
the
answer
to
the
constitutional
dilemma
that
this
particular
statute
poses,
because
this
is
an
unconstitutional
sentencing
factor,
and
it
is
a
sentencing
factor
upon
which
a
sentencing
authority
may
not
take
evidence
because
of
its
unconstitutionality.
consequently,
it
is
the
kind
of
factor
the
inclusion
of
which
requires
automatic
reversal.
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
an
independent
appellate
weighing
process
cannot
cure
this
kind
of
a
constitutional
defect.
and
again,
if
i
could
analogize
to
the
situation
involving
a
defendant's
race.
let
us
say
again
that
if,
instead
of
the
requirement
that
the
trial
judge
take
into
account
the
mandatory
jury
sentence
of
death,
the
alabama
statute
said
he
must
take
into
account
the
fact
that
a
defendant
is
black,
clearly
this
court
would
not
say
that
the
appellate
weighing
process
would
cure
that
constitutional
defect
and
allow
that
kind
of
a
statute
to
be
continued
to
be
used
by
the
state
of
alabama.
there's
a
final
argument
that
the
state
makes,
and
that
argument's
embodied
in
appendix
a
of
its
brief,
where
it
lists
the
remaining
persons
in
the
state
of
alabama
who
are
affected
by
that
statute.
what
it
is
is
an
invitation
to
this
court
to
ignore
this
statute's
constitutionality
because
the
only
people
left
that
are
affected
by
it
are
people
who
have
committed
seriously
bad
crimes.
but
that's
not
something
that
this
court
has
ever
done.
the
fact
that
these
people
have
committed
serious
crimes
should
not
override
the
fact
that
all
of
these
people
have
been
sentenced
to
death
under
a
process
that
is
unconstitutional,
a
process
that
is
fatally
flawed
by
the
very
nature
of
the
alabama
death
penalty
law.
again,
the
state
asks
you
to
ignore
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
statute
because
the
remaining
individuals
left
who
are
affected
by
it
are
people
who
have
committed
serious
crimes.
in
conclusion,
and
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
rebuttal,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
tell
brian
keith
baldwin
that
he
can
go
out
on
the
street
again.
we're
not
asking
you
to
release
brian
keith
baldwin.
what
we
are
simply
asking
you
is
to
say
that
if
the
state
of
alabama
wants
to
have
a
death
sentence
imposed
in
brian
keith
bladwin,
that
they
do
so
in
a
manner
that
comports
with
the
federal
constitution,
and
that
the
present
manner
in
which
his
death
sentence
was
obtained
was
pursuant
to
an
unconstitutional
state
statute
which
ought
to
be
reversed.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
it
is
indeed
a
two-step
process,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
argument
is
and
was
that
there
is
a
factor
included
in
the
second
step
of
the
process
which
is
unconstitutional,
therefore
making
the
sentencing
scheme
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
statute
requires
the
sentencing
judge
to
take
into
account
the
mandatory
jury
sentence
of
death.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
but
in
the
process
of
accepting
it,
he
is
required,
in
order
to
impose
a
death
sentence,
he
is
required
to
weigh
the
aggravating
and
the
mitigating
circumstances,
like
every
other
statute
in
the
country.
but
the
alabama
statute
includes
a
requirement
that
he
weigh
the
mandatory
jury
sentence
of
death,
which
we
contend
is
an
unconstitutional
factor.
hence,
the
statute
injects
into
the
weighing
process
a
factor
that
is
unconstitutional,
that
has
no
place
in
it,
that's
irrelevant,
that's
immaterial
for
sentencing;
and
that
that
makes
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
no,
i
think
the
court's
clearly
upheld
statutes
similar
to
that.
but
those
statutes
aren't
this
statute.
this
isn't
the
florida
statute.
the
florida
statute
doesn't
require
the
judge
to
take
into
account
as
part
of
his
sentencing
decision
a
standardless...
i'm
sorry...
an
unguidelined
sentence
of
death.
i
almost
said
it
again.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
indeed
he
did,
and
as
soon
as
that
word
came
out
of
my
mouth
i
regretted
it.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i
think
that
that
line
of
reasoning
ignores
two
things:
both
the
flaws
of
the
mandatory
sentencing
scheme
and
also
the
fact
that
the
jury
may
or
may
not
return
this
mistrial,
which
is
an
option
available
to
them
under
the
statute.
and
we
don't
know,
quite
frankly,
how
the
trial
judge
views
the
jury's
ability
to
mistry.
and
the
problem
with
this
case
from
the
state's
standpoint
is,
we
don't
know
exactly
what
the
trial
judge
thinks
about
this
statute
or
what
he
does.
we
knew
on
the
face
of
it
he's
required
to
take
into
account
the
mandatory
sentence.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
judge
may
conduct
an
independent
analysis
into
whether
or
not
the
aggravating
circumstances
the
jury
found
exist.
so
arguably
he
could
find
that
the
jury's
verdict
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
did
not...
that
there
was
no
aggravating
circumstance
present.
so
in
those
circumstances
he
would
not
be
required
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
death.
in
fact,
in
order
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
death
he
must,
as
part
of
his
sentencing
order,
find
that
an
aggravating
circumstance
is
present.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
and
that
it
outweighs
any
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that's
true.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that's
also
true.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
he
has
the
ability
to
correct
that
error,
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
again,
to
rehash
the
argument,
he's
still
required,
in
sentencing
somebody
to
death,
to
take
into
account
that
jury
verdict.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
if
he
thinks
they're
dead
wrong,
then
arguably
he
would
have
the
ability
to
set
aside
that
sentence.
but
i
think
the
comment
that
this
court
made
in
the
beck
opinion
and
also
the
statistics
as
to
how
the
statute
operates
bears
out
the
fact
that
that
rarely,
if
ever,
happens.
thank
you.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i'll
be
very
brief,
mr.
chief
justice.
by
way
of
statistical
analysis,
mr.
carnes
has
relied
in
great
measure
on
how
this
statute
operates.
and
he
in
his
own
brief
in
a
footnote
tells
the
court
there
were
65
people
that
were
sentenced
under
this
statute.
if
you
remove
from
that
65
sample
the
13
people
who
pled
guilty
as
a
result
of
a
plea
bargain,
only
four
sentences
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole
were
imposed
by
trial
judges
in
the
state
as
a
result
of
a
contested
proceeding.
so
what
mr.
justice
stevens
said
in
beck
is
exactly
correct,
that
this
procedure
that
we
have
created
where
the
trial
judge
is
required
to
take
into
account
the
death
sentence
skews
the
death
sentencing
process
in
favor
of
a
death
sentence.
i'm
troubled
very
deeply
by
what
i
sense,
that,
yes,
this
is
a
strange
statute,
yes,
no
other
court
in
the
country
has
one
like
this,
but
it's
okay
because
we
know
what
the
judge
knows
and
how
the
judge
acts.
but
there
is
not
one
jot,
speck,
or
iota
of
evidence
in
this
record
about
how
trial
judges
in
alabama
treat
this
statute,
other
than
the
fact
that
we
know
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
they
sentence
defendants
to
death
underneath
it.
this
is
a
facial
constitutional
attack
on
this
statute,
and
i've
not
heard
serious
arguments
out
of
the
state
that
there
is
anything
really
constitutional
about
this
procedure
on
its
face.
what
i
hear
is
an
argument
that
the
judge
knows
what
it
is,
ignores
it,
and
therefore
everything's
fine.
and
the
court
cannot
uphold
this
facial
constitutional
attack...
or
deny
this
facial
constitutional
attack
on
its
perceptions
or
mr.
carne's
perceptions
or
my
perceptions
about
what
judges
may
think
or
may
not
think.
we
know
that
on
its
face
this
statute
says
the
jury
must
return
a
mandatory
sentence
of
death.
we
further
know
that
the
jury
has
a
mistrial
provision,
so
it
doesn't
really
have
to
return
a
mandatory
sentence
of
death.
and
the
trial
judge,
if
he
reads
the
statute,
knows
that
the
jury
may
disagree
on
the
sentence
of
death.
so
to
the
trial
judge,
does
the
mandatory
sentence
mean
that
the
jury
didn't
disagree
and
therefore
i
ought
to
take
it
into
account?
the
statute
requires
him
to
do
that.
mr.
carnes
makes
a
great
deal
about
the
interpretation
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
placed
on
this
statute.
well,
let's
look
at
the
interpretation
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
placed
in
this
very
case.
it
didn't
mention
anything
about
the
verdict
form
being
a
messenger
to
convey
an
aggravating
circumstance
to
the
sentencing
authority
or
that
it
embodied
a
legislative
judgment.
the
alabama
supreme
court
says
in
this
case:
56
of
the
joint
appendix:
"we
hold
the
sentence
procedure
is
constitutional.
"
"the
statute
is
saved
by
the
fact
that
the
court,
which
is
the
sentencing
authority,
considers
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
offense
and
the
characters
and
propensities
of
the
offender,
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
in
a
separate
and
independent
sentencing
area.
"
it
didn't
say
anything
about
what
the
judge
knows.
what
this
statute
requires
the
trial
judge
to
do
is
take
into
account
an
unconstitutional
factor,
and
if
this
court's
opinion
in
zant
v.
stephens
means
anything
at
all
it
means
that
a
sentencing
process
where
that
is
required
is
unconstitutional,
and
we
simply
ask
the
court
to
so
hold.
thank
you.
