justice
white
well,
the
jury
doesn't
have
any
standards
to
apply
in
imposing
the
death
penalty.
it's
told,
if
you
find
the
defendant
guilty
you
impose
it;
you
have
no
discretion
whatsoever.
justice
white
that's
not
standardless.
justice
white
that's
about
as
clear
a
standard
as
i
can
imagine.
if
you
find
him
guilty,
you
enter
a
sentence
of
death.
it's
a
sort
of
a
ministerial
act.
justice
white
also,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
jury
is
just
automatically
required
to
impose
the
death
sentence
and
the
judge
knows
it,
to
tell
him
to
take
into
consideration
that
the
jury
imposed
the
death
sentence
is
like
saying
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
jury
found
him
guilty.
justice
white
and
that
it
outweighs
any
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
white
and
there
can't
be
a
death
sentence
unless
there's
an
aggravating
circumstance
proved.
justice
white
and
found
by
the
jury.
justice
white
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
white
well,
were
there
mitigating
circumstances
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
but
nevertheless
there
was
one
and
the
judge
weighed
it?
justice
white
so
we're
not
dealing
with
a
case
where
there
is
no
mitigating
circumstance?
justice
white
and
the
judge
here
would
not
have
been
required
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
justice
white
or
he
just,
he
didn't
weigh
them
correctly.
