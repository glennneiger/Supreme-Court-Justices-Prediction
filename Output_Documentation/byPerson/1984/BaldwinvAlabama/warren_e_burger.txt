we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
baldwin
against
alabama.
mr.
carroll,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit.
when
the
jury
is
considering
the
sentencing
only,
the
punishment,
what
are
the
options?
chief
justice
burger
in
a
separate
proceeding?
chief
justice
burger
but
then
the
judge
has
another
crack
at
it,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
burger
excuse
me,
counsel.
when
you
said
the
appellant
here
was
not
the
trigger
man...
is
that
what
you
said?
chief
justice
burger
but
it
is
a
two-step
process,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
you'd
better
give
that
to
me
again,
just
to
be
sure
i
have
it.
chief
justice
burger
that
means
he
can
accept
it
or
reject
it,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
the
statute
provided
that
the
judge
could
ignore
a
jury
recommendation
of
a
life
sentence,
rather
than
a
death
sentence?
would
you
think
that
would
be
more
unconstitutional
than
this
one?
chief
justice
burger
justice
white
pointed
out
that
the
standards
are
pretty
strict
here.
chief
justice
burger
then
if
the
judge
thinks
the
jury
went
off
on
the
wrong
tangent,
he
can
correct
that
error,
can't
he?
chief
justice
burger
but
if
he
thinks
they're
dead
wrong,
how
much
weight
do
you
suppose
the
judge
will
give
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
carnes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
carroll?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
