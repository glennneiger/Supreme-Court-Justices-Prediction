mr.
edward
earl
carnes
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
this
statute
as
a
whole,
as
interpreted
and
applied
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case
and
by
the
alabama
appellate
courts
in
this
and
other
cases,
provides
sufficient
reliability
in
the
sentencing
process.
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
my
friend
is
constitutional
or
whether
the
statute
as
this
court
might
have
interpreted
it
on
initial
review
is
constitutional,
or
even
whether
the
statute
as
written
in
its
plain
language
is
constitutional.
one
of
the
most
fundamental
propositions
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
is
it
must
take
state
statutes
as
they
have
been
interpreted
by
state
courts,
and
you
held
that
in
proffitt
v.
florida.
and
indeed,
jurek
v.
texas
is
the
best
proof
of
that,
because
the
texas
statute
as
written
did
not
provide
for
any
mitigating
circumstances.
indeed,
the
plain
language
precluded
that.
however,
the
texas
court,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
interpreted
mitigating
circumstances
into
the
statute,
and
accordingly
this
court
upheld
it.
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
not
interpreted
the
statute
the
way
mr.
carroll
does,
nor
did
the
trial
court.
the
state
is
not
arguing
that
everybody
ignores
this
statute,
and
it
is
not
asking
this
court
to
set
a
precedent
that
if
everybody
ignores
a
constitutional
defect
it
is
okay.
instead,
the
state
is
saying,
asking
this
court
to
reaffirm
its
precedents
that
statutes
have
to
be
judged
by
this
court
as
they've
been
interpreted
and
applied
by
the
trial
courts
and
the
appellate
courts
of
the
state.
one
of
the
most
fundamental
disagreements
that
mr.
carroll
and
i
have
is
his
statement
that
under
the
statute
the
jury
mandatorily
sentences
the
defendant
to
death.
the
alabama
appellate
courts
have
repeatedly
held
that
what
the
jury
does
is
not
sentence
the
defendant
to
death.
of
course,
the
state
has
no
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that
if
the
jury
exercises
sentencing
power
then
it
should
be
permitted
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances
and
should
be
given
guidelines.
but
the
jury
under
this
statute
is
not
given
any
guidelines
because
it
has
no
sentencing
power.
the
jury
is
not
permitted
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances
because
it's
not
a
sentencing
authority.
the
jury
is
neither
forced
to
nor
permitted
to
make
a
sentencing
decision.
it
does
not
say
what
the
sentence
should
be.
instead,
the
sole
decision
the
jury
makes
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
the
aggravated
homicide
capital
offense
with
the
serious
aggravating
circumstance
defined
into
it
which
he
is
charged
in
the
indictment
with.
if
the
jury
finds
the
defendant
guilty,
then
it
is
true
that,
as
a
matter
of
law
and
automatically,
the
jury
must
return
a
verdict
form
containing
formal
language
"fixing
the
punishment
at
death".
but
every
time
the
alabama
appellate
courts
have
looked
at
this
procedure
they
have
said,
that's
not
a
sentence,
that
is
just
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
guilt
verdict,
and
what
it
means
is
that
the
jury
has
found
him
guilty.
mr.
carroll
argues,
and
quite
properly
so,
that
one
of
the
most
important
things
is
how
the
trial
court
interpreted
the
statute,
because
i
will
be
candid
with
this
court:
all
the
decisions
we
cite
in
our
brief
save
one
came
out
after
the
trial
court
acted
in
this.
but
this
court
need
not
speculate
how
the
trial
court
interpreted
it,
because
the
sentencing
order
the
trial
court
entered
on
page
18
of
the
joint
appendix
indicates
that
the
trial
court,
after
finding
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
the
trial
court
said:
"the
court
having
considered
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
the
mitigating
circumstances,
and
after
weighing
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
far
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances
and
that
the
death
penalty
as
fixed
by
this
jury
should
be
and
is
hereby
accepted.
"
as
the
alabama
supreme
court
explained
in
this
very
case,
saying
that
the
death
penalty
as
fixed
by
the
jury
is
hereby
accepted
or
rejected
if
it's
a
life
without
parole
sentence,
it
simply
necessarily
follows
as
a
matter
of
form
and
as
a
matter
of
semantics
from
the
fact
that
the
decision
the
judge
enters
either
agrees
with
or
disagrees
with
the
verdict
form
language,
not
with
any
sentence
imposed
by
the
jury,
because
the
jury
doesn't
impose
one.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
it
depends
on
whether
there
is
any
mitigating
circumstance
established
either
by
the
evidence
at
the
guilt
stage
or
by
the
evidence
at
sentence
stage.
now,
of
course
there
is
not
an
inquiry
into
mitigating
circumstance
at
the
guilt
stage,
but
sometimes
it
could
come
in
anyway.
for
example,
if
there
was
an
insanity
defense
and
the
defendant
didn't
quite
make
the
insanity
defense,
but
showed
he
was
emotionally
disturbed
at
the
guilt
stage,
the
judge
could
consider
that
as
a
mitigating
circumstance.
however,
if
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances,
statutory
or
nonstatutory
in
the
broadest
sense
of
the
term,
then
the
legislature
has
directed,
in
part
through
this
verdict
form
language,
that
the
sentence
should
be
and
must
be
death.
and
that's
one
of
the
functions
of
the
verdict
form.
it
conveys
from
the
legislature
to
the
judge...
the
jury
is
merely
the
messenger,
merely
performs
a
ministerial
duty...
that
the
penalty
should
be
death
if
the
judge
agrees
there's
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
and
if
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances,
which
we
see
as
substantively...
not
procedurally,
but
substantively...
indistinguishable
from
the
florida
statute
that
this
court
upheld
in
proffitt.
indeed,
justice
white's
opinion
points
out
in
proffitt
that
the
florida
statute
had
been
interpreted...
it
must
be
accepted
as
interpreted...
as
requiring
a
death
sentence
if
there
was
an
aggravating
circumstance
not
outweighed
by
mitigating.
that's
not
a
unique
provision
there.
that
substantive
judgment,
15
state
statutes
embody
it.
and
also,
it
really
only
makes
common
sense,
because
an
aggravating
circumstance,
as
you
all
have
limited
them
in
zant
v.
stephens,
has
to
be
something
that
reasonably
justifies
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
and
sets
this
defendant
apart
from
all
of
the
others.
if
you've
got
that
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
jury
and
the
judge
both
agree
that
that
was
proven,
and
there
is
no
reason
under
lockett,
as
broadly
applied
in
this
and
other
cases,
there
is
no
reason
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty--
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
--there
was
only
one
mitigating
circumstance.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not.
in
fact,
as
in
most
cases--
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
--no,
your
honor,
he
certainly
was
not.
and
the
weighing
process...
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
made
this
clear
in
the
cook
case
and
other
cases...
the
weighing
process
is
not
a
numerical
tally.
there
are
no
assigned
weights,
as
in
florida.
instead,
once
there
is
a
mitigating
circumstance
and
an
aggravating
circumstance,
what
the
statute
requires
is
a
guided,
individualized
determination
in
the
judge's
discretion,
but
with
guidance,
as
to
whether
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed
or
not.
and
the
judge
makes
that
decision.
the
other
function
that
the
verdict
form
language
serves
in
addition--
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
--no,
your
honor,
the
jury
does
not
make
any
sentencing
determination
and
does
not
consider--
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
no,
your
honor.
when
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
form
containing
this
language,
that
was
the
end
of
the
guilt
stage,
and
that
proved
only
that
the
jury
had
found
a
serious
aggravating
circumstance
set
out
in
the
indictment
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
other
function
that
the
verdict
form
serves
is
to
convey...
and
this
is
why
the
alabama
cases
say,
they
talk
of
it
as
an
advisory
fixing
of
the
penalty
of
death
or
an
advisory
indication...
it
conveys
into
the
sentencing
stage
the
fact
that
the
jury
has
found
that
aggravating
circumstance,
the
definitional
one,
which
is
essential,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
indeed
the
judge
is
not
bound
by
it.
we've
had
cases,
cited
in
the
brief,
where
the
judge
has
said:
the
jury
found
it
but
i
don't;
i've
heard
some
other
stuff
in
this
sentence
hearing
and
i'm
not
going
along
with
it.
indeed,
we
had
one
case
where
the
judge
said:
well,
i
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
for
the
jury
to
find
this
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
convict.
but
we're
talking
about
the
death
penalty
here
and
i
just
don't
think
it
goes
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
plus
some,
which
i
require
for
the
death
sentence,
and
accordingly
i'm
going
to
sentence
him
to
life
without
parole.
mr.
carroll
says,
you
don't
need
the
verdict
form
requirement
to
embody
these
two
purposes.
obviously
you
don't.
the
state
doesn't
contend
that
you
do.
but
the
state
does
contend
that
merely
because
this
procedure
is
odd
or
convoluted
or
unique
or
unnecessary
doesn't
make
it
unconstitutional.
instead,
that
determination
has
to
be
on
whether
it
adversely
affects
any
rights
recognized
by
this
court
that
the
defendant
has,
and
we
maintain
that
it
does
not.
of
course,
if
unique
provisions
made
provisions
unconstitutional
i
would
imagine
that
spaziano
would
have
come
out
the
other
way,
so
would
jurek.
nobody
has...
talk
about
an
odd
procedure.
the
texas
three-question
procedure
is
not
only
unique,
but
it
comes
close
to
alabama's
in
terms
of
being
weird.
the
statutory
provision
that
the
judge
may
enter
a
mistrial
on
the
failure
of
the
jury
to
agree
on
the
verdict
of
guilty
or
not
guilty
or
on
the
fixing
of
the
penalty
of
death
does
not
indicate
that
the
jury
has
a
choice
about
fixing
the
penalty
of
death.
instead,
that
is
simply
a
safeguard
to
prevent
the
jury
from
coming
up
with
an
unjust
acquittal
should
it
rebel
at
the
legislative
directive
that
it
include
the
language
in
there.
and
indeed,
in
this
case
the
jury
was
not
instructed
on
the
mistrial
provision,
although
they
were
in
the
beck
case.
mr.
baldwin
through
mr.
carroll
makes
an
argument
in
his
brief
that
the
jury
is
forced
to
play
a
hobbled
and
distorted
role,
and
the
jury
is
torn
between
frustration
and
temptation.
but
of
course,
the
issue
is
not
whether
serving
in
one
of
these
cases
is
a
meaningful
life
experience
for
the
jury.
instead,
the
question
is
whether
this
procedure,
odd
as
it
may
be,
adversely
affects
any
rights
of
the
defendant.
now,
the
verdict
form
language
mr.
carroll
argues
affects
the
jury's
guilt
determination
and
in
fact,
because
of
the
verdict
form
provision,
it
may
indeed
appear
to
the
jury
and
may
have
appeared
to
the
jury
in
this
case
that
if
it
convicted
the
defendant
the
death
penalty
would
inevitably
follow
from
that.
but
that
could
only
have
benefited
mr.
baldwin.
the
opinions
in
woodson
and
roberts
establish
that
if
it
has
any
effect
at
all,
it
makes
the
jury
more
reluctant
to
convict
and
more
willing
to
acquit.
the
state
is
willing
to
concede
that
we
took
too
much
of
a
burden
on
ourselves
and
made
it
too
difficult
for
us
to
convict
mr.
baldwin.
but
in
fact
we
did
convict
him,
and
surely
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
new
sentencing
procedure
because
the
guilt
stage
procedure
made
it
too
likely
that
he
would
be
acquitted.
now,
woodson
and
roberts
did
hold
that
under
some
systems,
if
the
jury
feels
the
death
penalty
is
inevitable
upon
conviction,
as
they
may
have
in
this
one,
there
could
be
so
many
unjust
acquittals
as
to
skew
the
sentencing
pattern.
but
that
was
the
prediction
or
the
assumption
for
those
systems.
this
is
a
different
system
that
this
court
need
not
predict
or
assume
anything
about,
because
the
system
is
closed.
as
has
been
pointed
out,
every
case
that
will
ever
be
tried
under
this
system
has
been
tried.
the
results
are
in
and
they
show,
and
it
is
undisputed,
that
there
was
only
a
four
percent
acquittal
rate.
therefore,
there
can
have
been
no
unjust
acquittals.
of
course,
any
argument
that
the
verdict
form
may
have
caused
unjust
convictions
would
not
only
run
contrary
to
woodson
and
roberts
and
the
common
sense
historical
evidence,
but
would
also
be
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
hopper
v.
evans.
the
verdict
form
language
does
not
harm
the
defendant
in
front
of
the
judge
either,
because
the
provision
that
the
judge
is
to
weigh
or
consider
it
means
only
the
two
things
that
i
have
said,
that
he
is
to
consider
as
substantive
advice
that
the
jury
found
the
aggravating
circumstances
defined
into
the
capital
offense
and
that
he
is
to
consider,
not
weigh
but
consider,
the
legislative
determination
that
if
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances
then
death
must
follow.
it
can't
mean
that
the
jury...
the
judge
is
to
consider
it
as
a
recommendation
that
aggravation
outweighs
mitigation.
the
judge
knows
the
jury
didn't
consider
that.
or
as
to
what
the
sentence
should
be.
mr.
carroll's
arguments
that
the
judge
may
or
may
have
in
this
case
considered
it
that
way
run
contrary
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
cases
about
how
it
should
be
interpreted,
also
run
contrary
to
the
judge's
own
sentence
order.
he
said:
i'm
imposing
the
death
penalty
because
the
aggravating
circumstances
far
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances.
and
that
is
precisely
what
he's
supposed
to
do.
mr.
carroll's
argument
would
also
assume
that
the
judge
is
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
had
no
choice.
yet
he
in
fact
instructed
him
that
they
had
no
choice.
the
fact
that...
there
is
some
troubling
language,
troubling
for
our
side,
in
beck
v.
alabama...
i
prefer
to
call
it
dictum...
that
the
jury's
verdict
must
have
had
a
tendency
to
motivate
the
judge
to
impose
the
death
sentence
because
in
such
a
substantial
number
of
cases
there
was
a
death
sentence
imposed,
two-thirds
in
fact.
but
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court,
that
is
a
classical
example
of
the
logical
fallacy
of
assuming
that
because
something
comes
after
a
fact
it
is
caused
by
the
fact.
it
is,
with
all
due
respect,
not
fair
to
assume
that,
because
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is
we
have
narrowed
the
field
down
tremendously
at
the
guilt
stage.
the
only
people
entering
the
sentence
stage
are
those
in
which
a
very
serious
aggravating
circumstance
has
been
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
yes.
justice
jones
of
our
state
supreme
court,
contrary
to
the
other
eight
members,
did
say
that
he
thought
that
there
was
a
danger
that
there
would
be
public
pressure
from
the
announcement
of
the
jury
verdict
form
and
it
would
somehow
pressure
the
judge
or
could
pressure
the
judge.
of
course,
the
majority
answered
that
by
saying
that
the
very
judge
that
you
say
has
been
unfairly
criticized
we
note
has
continued
to
impose
life
without
parole
sentences.
and
indeed,
the
case
he
pointed
out
as
an
example
of
unfair
criticism,
when
it
got
up
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
looked
at
the
case
and
also
criticized
the
judge
for
imposing
a
life
without
parole
sentence
in
that,
because
they
said
the
aggravating
circumstances
indicated
it
should
have
been
death.
but
to
argue
that
in
a
sense
demeans
the
judicial
office,
because
we
call
on
judges
every
day.
every
day
a
judge
has
a
serious
trial.
he
is
forced
to
make
decisions
which
may
be
unpopular.
to
assume
that
they
won't
be
willing
to
do
so
because
of
public
clamor
or
comment
is
not
really
a
fitting
assumption.
also,
that
would
assume
that
the
public
is
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
had
no
choice.
yet,
if
it
is
a
high
profile,
highly
publicized
case,
the
public
will
know
that.
in
any
event,
the
majority
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
pointed
out
that,
be
that
as
it
may,
there
was
a
safeguard
to
prevent
any
undue
effect
from
that,
and
the
safeguard
was
that,
whatever
the
judge
did,
they
were
going
to
independently
redetermine
whether
the
sentence
of
death
was
proper
or
was
unproper.
appellate
review
of
death
sentence
cases
in
alabama
is
enhanced
by
three
special
rules:
search
the
record,
the
plain
error
rule,
and
two-tier.
no
death
sentence
leaves
our
system
unless
both
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
uphold
both
the
conviction
and
the
sentence.
i
point
out
and
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
alabama
appellate
courts
have
taken
their
duty
very
seriously.
in
fact,
we've
had
cases,
mr.
evans'
case,
where
he
said:
i
don't
want
to
appeal
my
case;
i
want
to
die.
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
said:
we
don't
care
whether
you
want
to
or
not;
we're
not
going
to...
we're
going
to
see.
it's
our
responsibility
that
the
death
penalty
is
imposed
in
this
state
only
for
the
utmost
of
compelling
legal
reasons,
and
we're
going
to
review
these
cases.
we're
going
to
go
over
them
with
a
fine
tooth
comb
whether
it's
requested
or
not.
and
in
fact,
of
the
pre-beck
cases,
before
beck
v.
alabama
and
when
the
preclusion
clause
defect
led
to
the
reversal
of
so
many
cases,
up
to
that
time
and
not
including
the
preclusion
clause
defect
there
had
been
34
cases
reviewed
at
one
stage
or
another
of
the
alabama
appellate
process.
the
convictions
were
reversed
in
18
percent
of
those
capital
cases.
the
death
sentences
were
reversed
in
44
percent
of
those
cases.
so
that
the
conviction
or
death
sentence,
one
or
the
other
or
both
were
reversed
in
62
percent
of
the
cases.
in
only
38
percent
of
the
cases,
including
this
one,
were
both
the
capital
convictions
and
the
death
sentence
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
initial
trial
guilt
stage
and
the
initial
sentence
proceeding
before
the
judge.
appellate
review
of
the
propriety
of
the
death
sentence
itself
is
the
point
which
we
stress.
it
has
three
facets
under
our
system.
both
appellate
courts,
not
just
one
but
both
appellate
courts,
determine
whether
the
death
sentence
is
imposed
under
the
influence
of
passion,
prejudice,
or
any
other
arbitrary
fact.
that's
like
the
georgia
system.
and
both
of
them
determined
in
this
case
that
it
was
not.
they
also
determine,
secondly,
whether
the
death
sentence
is
excessive
or
disproportionate
to
the
penalty
imposed
in
similar
cases.
that's
the
so-called
cross-case
proportionality
analysis
that
you
held
in
pulley
was
not
constitutionally
required,
but
certainly
was
nice
if
the
state
had
it.
well,
they
do
have
it.
we
do
have
it
and
both
states...
both
appellate
courts
held
that
it
wasn't
excessive,
and
they
cited
other
cases.
the
alabama
supreme
court
particularly
cited
the
co-defendant
case.
the
third
facet...
and
this
is
the
important
one...
there
is
an
independent
weighing
by
the
appellate
courts
themselves
of
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
to
determine
whether
death
is
the
proper
sentence
in
this
particular
case.
in
other
words,
they
in
effect
re-sentence.
if
aggravation
outweighs
mitigation,
then
they
affirm
the
death
sentence.
if
mitigation
outweighs
aggravation,
then
they
remand
for
new
sentencing.
now,
mr.
carroll
points
out
that
there
has
only
been
one
case
under
this
system
where
they
remanded
and
ordered
a
new
sentence.
but
the
whole
story
shows
that
in
fact
44
percent
of
the
death
sentences
were
reversed
on
other
grounds.
and
in
addition,
georgia's
system--
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
--no,
your
honor.
the
death
sentences
would
be
reversed
because
of
a
defect
in
a
misapplication
of
an
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
flaws
in
the
sentence
and
flaws
in
the
sentencing
process.
it
could
have
been
something
wrong
in
the
judge's
sentencing
order
or
in
the
hearing.
he
didn't
let
the
defendant
introduce
hearsay
evidence,
which
is
admissible;
or
he
mischaracterized
an
aggravating
circumstance;
or
he
failed
to
find
a
mitigating
circumstance.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
didn't
weigh
them
properly.
and
admittedly,
some
of
these
when
they
went
back,
when
the
judge
corrected
his
error
he
reimposed
the
death
sentence.
but
in
some
of
them
he
didn't.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
no,
your
honor.
after
beck
there
were
just
a
whole
host.
all
but
ten
cases
have
been
reversed
because
of
that.
these
are
exclusive
of
beck,
and
i
thought
in
the
analysis
it
was
only
proper
to
exclude
beck
because
of
that.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
by
or
under
direct
order
of
the
appellate
court,
as
opposed
to
as
a
result
of
a
correction
when
it
got
back,
only
one.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
after
it
gets
corrected,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
i
know
in
addition
to
the
one
in
which
the
appellate
court
said--
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
--it
is,
your
honor,
except
that
if
death
is
determined
to
be
a
proper
sentence
after
the
errors
are
corrected,
i
would
admit
that...
i
would
contend
that
that's
what
the
constitution
requires.
i
know
there's
been
at
least
one
where
the
judge
corrected
the
error
and
said,
well--
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
your
honor,
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
the
alabama
supreme
courts
weren't
letting
anybody
be
sentenced
to
death
under
this,
simply
that
they
were
very
careful
in
the
way
they
applied
the
review
of
the
death
sentence.
i
would
also
point
out
that
georgia'
much-vaunted
system,
according
to
the
statistics
that
you
put,
i
believe
in
the
pulley
opinion--
mr.
edward
earl
carnes
--yes,
sir.
but
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
respond
to
mr.
carroll's
argument
that
the
alabama
supreme
courts
haven't
reversed
enough
death
sentences.
georgia
has
reversed
seven
death
sentences
and
ordered
them
to
be
reduced,
but
five
of
those
were
in
non-homicide
cases,
rape
or
robbery
with
no
killing,
which
couldn't
even
be
a
capital
offense
in
alabama.
one
of
the
remaining
ones
was
where
the
defendant
had
been
sentenced
to
life
without
parole
the
first
time,
a
classic
bullington
problem.
there's
only
been
one
case
in
georgia
in
ten
years,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
two
and
a
half
times
as
many
people
on
death
row
as
we
did
at
the
time
of
beck,
there's
only
been
one
case
where
they
ordered
a
comparable
sentence
reduced.
both
alabama
appellate
courts
expressly
determined
in
this
case
that
the
death
sentence
was
proper
because
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
their
own
opinion
"greatly
outweighed",
was
the
phrase
they
used,
the
lone
mitigating
circumstance.
there's
been
no
evidence,
suggestion,
or
even
hint
that
what
mr.
carroll
calls
the
arbitrary
factor
of
the
jury's
verdict
was
considered
by
them.
the
language
in
zant
v.
stephens
that
says
that
if
a
state
treats
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
something
constitutionally
irrelevant
or
impermissible
harmless
error
analysis
doesn't
apply
is
not
applicable
here
because
all
the
aggravating
circumstances
were
proper
and
permissible.
in
any
event,
we're
not
arguing
at
this
point
harmless
error.
what
we're
saying
is
that
you
have
to
consider,
as
you
have
in
the
past,
the
system
as
a
whole.
and
when
you
consider
the
system
as
a
whole,
one
important
part
of
it
is
the
appellate
review,
the
re-sentencing,
in
effect,
at
the
appellate
level.
this
court
has
often
held
in
the
past
that
the
whole
system
has
to
be
considered
because
what
counts
is
the
final
result.
the
only
death
sentence
or
the
only
sentence
that
matters
is
the
one
on
the
case
when
it
leaves
the
appellate
system.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
system
in
substance...
substance
over
form...
this
system
in
substance
has
provided
a
constitutional
way
to
reliable
determine
which
murderers
should
be
sentenced
to
death
and
which
should
not.
now,
mr.
carroll
points
out
that
i
have
included
in
appendix
a
to
my
brief
citations
and
summaries
of
the
nine
of
other
pre-beck
death
sentence
cases.
he
misinterprets
the
reason
i
did
so.
i
didn't
say
that
these
folks
ought
to
be
executed
simply
because
they're
bad
people.
i've
been
before
this
court
too
many
times
to
know...
to
think
that
this
court
would
buy
an
argument
like
that.
instead,
the
reason
i
put
that
up
there
is
to
say:
this
is
a
unique
opportunity;
this
case
is
different
from
every
one
this
court
has
ever
had,
not
just
because
of
the
nature
of
the
procedure,
but
because
this
is
a
closed
system.
you
don't
have
to
predict
and
assume
how
it
will
apply,
how
it
will
result
in
future
cases.
you've
had
to
do
that
ever
other
post-furman
case
you've
ever
decided.
you've
had
to
make
some
kind
of
prediction
or
assumption.
you
don't
have
to
do
it
here.
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
this
case
and
the
nine
other
in
the
appendix
cited.
and
the
state
thinks
that
when
you
do
that
you
will
agree
with
the
state
that,
whatever
its
oddity,
whatever
the
procedural
quirks,
and
however
the
language
of
the
statute
may
be
written,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
system
has
operated
in
a
rational
bottom
line
manner
so
that
the
ten
people
left
on
death
row
under
it
are
some
of
the
most
heinous
murderers,
some
of
the
most
vicious
murderers,
and
have
committed
some
of
the
most
heinous
crimes
that
have
ever
been
committed
in
our
state.
and
that
is,
after
all,
the
whole
point
of
furman
and
the
two
dozen
some-odd
cases
since
then,
to
ensure
that
the
ones
we
separate
out
and
make
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
are
those
who
are
truly
deserving
to
die.
if
we
assume
that
anyone
is
to
be
sentenced
to
death,
then
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
separate
out
a
group
through
some
procedure
of
the
folks
most
deserving
to
die.
and
the
state
submits
that
that
has
been
done.
this
particular
case
is
a
paradigm
example
of
that.
eight
years
ago,
mr.
baldwin
escaped
from
prison
while
he
was
serving
a
robbery
sentence
and
kidnapped,
robbed,
raped,
beat,
sodomized,
choked,
ran
over,
and
stabbed
an
innocent
young
girl.
then
he
locked
her,
naked
and
bleeding,
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
while
he
drove
across
four
states.
it
was
only
after
he
had
done
all
that
and
only
into
the
second
day
that
he,
according
to
his
own
testimony,
bought
the
drugs
which
mr.
carroll
said
is
a
mitigating
circumstance.
and
after
she
had
suffered
some
40
hours,
he
took
her
out
of
the
trunk,
ran
over
her
again,
and
then
chopped
her
to
death
with
a
hatchet.
when
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
this
case
was
doing
its
own
review
of
the
case
to
determine
whether
the
conviction
was
proper
and
whether
the
sentence
was
proper,
it
took
the
tape
recording
of
the
confession
which
went
up
with
the
case
and
it
listened.
and
they
wrote
in
the
opinion,
and
this
was
the
first
opinion
back
in
'78
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
issued,
that
we've
listened
to
this
and
the
petitioner
relates
these
events
and
what
he
did
with
no
more
emotion
than
if
he
were
describing
how
he
changed
a
car,
and
he
does
not
express
any
remorse
and
has
never
expressed
any
remorse
for
having
"treated
this
unfortunate
innocent
victim
with
a
brutality
not
found
in
animals,
and
had
mercilessly
slaughtered
this
defenseless
young
girl.
"
now,
we
submit
that,
whatever
the
procedural
oddities,
this
is
the
kind
of
case,
this
and
the
nine
other
cases,
some
of
which
come
close
to
rivaling
this
case
in
terms
of
pure
viciousness,
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
ought
to
be
singled
out
for
the
death
penalty.
of
course,
to
re-sentence
mr.
baldwin
now
we
would
have
to
in
effect
retry
the
whole
case
before
a
new
sentencing
authority
and
start
that
long
appellate
process
all
over
again.
six
to
eight
years
from
now,
we
could
be
back
in
front
of
this
same
court
with
a
new
set
of
lawyers
and
a
new
set
of
issues.
and
all
the
while,
no
one
can
seriously
doubt
that,
if
anyone
is
to
be
sentenced
to
death
for
his
crime,
this
particular
petitioner
deserves
it.
of
course,
if
the
constitution
requires
that,
then
so
be
it.
but
our
position
is
simply
that
the
state
of
alabama
and
its
people
submit
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
that.
