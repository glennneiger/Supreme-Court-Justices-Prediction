justice
marshall
i
know
it
was
true
20
years
ago.
justice
marshall
well,
i'm
just
curious.
if
it
was
rare
and
you
didn't
resort
to
it,
i
take
it
most
resort
must
have
been
to
7403.
what
suddenly
changed
the
practice?
justice
marshall
in
this
case
was
the
amount
of
the
levy
the
exact
amount
that
was
in
the
bank,
as
usual?
justice
marshall
you
didn't
get
all
of
it
this
time?
justice
marshall
but
doesn't
that
money
go
right
straight
in
the
treasury,
right
straight?
doesn't
even
slow
down
at
irs?
[laughter]
justice
marshall
well,
all
i
know
is
that
in
a
similar
case
up
on
the
second
circuit
they
told
a
certain
judge
that
he
didn't
know
where
the
money
was.
the
irs
man
said
that.
justice
marshall
is
that
normal?
justice
marshall
and
when
in
doubt,
seize
it.
justice
marshall
well,
just
one
moment.
on
the
of
commerce,
could
this
man
draw
it
all
out?
justice
marshall
he
could
have
withdrawn
the
whole
thing
himself?
justice
marshall
at
any
time,
and
that
rule
of
the
law,
either
way
it
was
the
same?
state
law
or
the
rule
of
the
bank
were
both
the
same?
justice
marshall
it's
the
first
one
that
gets
there
would
get
it.
justice
marshall
and
the
other
two
had
no
rights
after
that?
