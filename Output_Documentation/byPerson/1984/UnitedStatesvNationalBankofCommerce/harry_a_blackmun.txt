justice
blackmun
mr.
wynne,
maybe
i
missed
something.
why
did
you
say
that
these
statutes
were
passed
for
the
bank's
protection?
justice
blackmun
couldn't
they
have
been
passed
for
the
convenience
of
the
depositors?
justice
blackmun
is
that
statement
exclusive
or
inclusive?
justice
blackmun
mr.
wynne,
with
all
this
in
the
background,
why
does
your
bank
indulge
in
or
permit
joint
accounts
at
all?
justice
blackmun
because
your
competition
does?
justice
blackmun
because
the
customers
want
it,
really?
justice
blackmun
but
if
a
check
came
along
signed
by
roy,
is
it,
not
for
taxes
but
just
drawing
everything,
your
bank
would
pay
it
out
without
any
question
as
to
whether
neva
or
ruby
owned
it?
justice
blackmun
but
you
draw
the
distinction
between
what
the
chief
justice
has
just
indicated
and
the
levy?
justice
blackmun
does
the
record
contain
the
agreement
of
deposit?
people
normally
sign
a
card
setting
forth
the
conditions
of
the
deposit.
does
the
record
contain
that?
