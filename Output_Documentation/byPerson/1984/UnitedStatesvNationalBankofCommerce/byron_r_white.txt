justice
white
that's
what
you're
levying
on.
justice
white
well,
the
way...
i
suppose
the
way
they
would
prove
it
is
saying
that,
if
we
sued
him
in
a
state
court,
we
would
win.
justice
white
what
if
the
taxpayer
writes
a
check
to
the
irs
and
pays
his
bill,
his
tax
bill,
out
of
the
joint
property,
and
it
exhausts
the
account?
then
does
the
third
party
have
any
kind
of
a
remedy
against
you
or
what?
you've
cashed
the
check
and
applied
it
to
his
tax
bill.
does
the
third
party
then
come
in
and
say:
look,
this
fellow
paid
his...
wrote
a
check
and
paid
his
bill
out
of
the
joint
account,
but
we
want
it
back
because
it
didn't
all
belong
to
him?
justice
white
so
you
think
the
reason
they
have
a
remedy
under
the
levy,
in
the
levy
situation,
is
because
congress
says
they
do?
justice
white
well,
they've
taken
the
money,
but
you
may
have
applied
it
to
his
tax,
and
why
is
it
any
different
situation
than
when
he
wrote
a
check
and
delivered
it
to
you?
it's
because
congress
apparently
has
provided
a
remedy
for
a
wrongful
levy.
justice
white
what
makes
you
think
that
the
taxpayer
has
the
right
to
withdraw
this
money?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
white
--but
you
wouldn't...
you
also
concede,
though,
that
that
right
doesn't
give
him
a
right
against
his
co-depositor,
his
co-owner
of
the
account?
justice
white
so
he
has
breached
his
duty
to
his
co-depositors.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
he
has.
let's
assume
he
has.
then
he
had
no
right,
no
right
to
withdraw
the
money.
the
bank
is
off
the
hook,
that's
true,
but
that's
the
only
reason
for
the
provision
in
the
arkansas
law.
but
he
really
had
no
right
to
all
that
property
at
that
time.
if
he
did,
the
third
party
could
never
recover.
justice
white
all
right,
he
had
the
right
against
the
bank.
yes,
he
had
the
right
against
the
bank.
justice
white
well,
what
if
he
writes
a
check,
what
if
he
writes
a
check
on
the
account
for
his
tax,
and
the
co-depositor
finds
out
about
it
and
goes
to
court
for
an
injunction
and
the
bank
is
ordered
not
to
pay
it,
not
to
honor
the
check,
because
he
had
no
right
to--
justice
white
--well,
what
it's
restricted
by
is
if
somebody
else
has
an
interest
in
the
account.
justice
white
he
doesn't
own
all
the
account,
or
any
of
it
maybe.
