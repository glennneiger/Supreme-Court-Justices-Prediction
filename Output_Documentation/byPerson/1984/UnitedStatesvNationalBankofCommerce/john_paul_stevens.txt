justice
stevens
no,
but
they'd
have
a
complaint
against
him,
wouldn't
they?
justice
stevens
supposing
his
wife
had
a
big
pile
of
cash
at
home.
i
suppose
he
could
take
it
and
pay
his
taxes
with
it.
could
the
irs
grab
that
cash?
justice
stevens
in
their
desk
drawer
at
home.
justice
stevens
do
they
have
to
prove
the
levy
was
wrongful?
justice
stevens
and
your
contention
is
that
this
was
not
a
wrongful
levy
even
if
they
owned
the
money,
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
therefore
the
levy
was
not
wrongful.
justice
stevens
even
if
they
owned
the
money.
justice
stevens
it
wouldn't
do
them
any
good
to
prove
it,
is
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest,
because
if
the
levy
is
not
wrongful
they
have
no
remedy
against
you.
justice
stevens
can
it
do
what
the
taxpayer
could
not
do
lawfully?
justice
stevens
if
the
money
belonged
to
the
co-depositor,
he
could
lawfully
appropriate
it
to
his
own
use
and
pay
one
of
his
own
bills?
justice
stevens
you'd
consider
that
lawful
conduct
if
someone
does
that?
justice
stevens
you
and
i
have
a
joint
account,
and
the
money
in
it
happens
to
be
yours
because
i
haven't
made
a
deposit
for
a
couple
of
years.
can
i
lawfully
withdraw
that
and
spend
it
to
pay
my
own
bills?
i
can
lawfully
withdraw
it,
but
can
i
use
it
to
pay
my
own
bills?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question.
you
have
said
that
the
person
who
may
turn
out
to
own
the
money,
other
than
the
taxpayer,
has
a
wrongful
levy
action
against
the
government,
even
though
you
acted
within
the
statute.
is
there
any
case
so
holding,
that
the
third
party
can
recover
on
a
wrongful
levy
theory
what
you
are
saying
here
is
a
proper
procedure
for
the
government
to
follow?
justice
stevens
well,
we
put
it
in
the
bank
now.
justice
stevens
my
question
is
are
there
any
joint
bank
account
cases
in
which
the
co-owner
of
the
account,
on
facts
as
we
assume
to
exist
here,
has
been
able
to
recover
the
money
from
the
government
on
a
wrongful
levy
theory?
justice
stevens
maybe
no
irs
person
ever
dreamed
of
making
such
a
levy,
either.
justice
stevens
well,
but
what
is
the
source
of
that
information?
you
put
that
in
your
brief,
but
that's
not
in
the
record
in
this
case,
is
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
how
do
we
know
how
reliable
that
is
and
whether
they're
all
cases
just
like
this?
this
is
rather
unusual,
to
come
up
with
this
much
detailed
evidence,
that
you
rely
on
very
heavily,
not
a
word
in
the
record
about
it.
justice
stevens
and
treatises
that
say
the
contrary
prior
to
1981.
justice
stevens
that's
all
a
matter
of
public
record.
none
of
this
is
a
matter
of
public
record
that
i'm
aware
of.
justice
stevens
how
many
of
them
are
joint
accounts
and
how
many
of
them
are
joint
accounts
where
they're
not
joint
taxpayers;
there
are
all
sorts
of
varieties
of
facts.
justice
stevens
mr.
wynne,
could
i
ask
you
a
factual
question.
maybe
this
is
outside
the
record,
but
there
have
been
apparently
millions
of
these
levies
over
the
past
several
years,
and
i
guess
your
bank
is
a
big
enough
bank
to
have
gotten
a
lot
of
them.
has
your
bank
changed
its
policy
recently
and
just
decided
not
to
honor
the
obligations
to
the
government?
justice
stevens
and
the
bank
has
always
taken
the
position
that
they
won't
honor
a
levy
like
this?
