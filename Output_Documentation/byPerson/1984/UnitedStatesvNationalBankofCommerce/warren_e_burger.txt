we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
national
bank
of
commerce.
mr.
lauber,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
if
she
publicly
acknowledged
that
he
had
the
right,
the
same
right
that
she
had
of
access,
would
that
affect
your
response?
chief
justice
burger
so
that's
the
equivalent
of
the
other
public
acknowledgment?
chief
justice

e.

mr.
wynne.
chief
justice
burger
what
if,
as
one
of
the
questions
put,
the
taxpayer
here
had
written
a
check
on
the
account
or
got
a
draft
from
the
bank
out
of
the
account
and
paid
it
to
the
treasury.
would
the
other
two
joint
owners,
joint
tenants,
have
any
claim
against
irs?
chief
justice
burger
would
they
have
any
kind
of
a
claim?
chief
justice
burger
you'd
honor
it
from
any
one
of
the
three,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
burger
they
have
each
absolute
control
over
the
total?
chief
justice
burger
how
about
each
other?
chief
justice
burger
would
it
be
any
different
if
it
was
a
check
payable
to
the
irs?
chief
justice
burger
if
you
had
honored
this
check,
your
bank
had
honored
this
check,
would
the
other
two
non-taxpayers
have
any
action
under
arkansas
law
against
the
bank?
chief
justice
burger
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
you'd
honor
any
check
that
came
through.
chief
justice
burger
my
question
now
is,
having...
as
you've
said
a
few
minutes
ago,
the
bank
had
honored
a
check
payable
to
irs
for
exactly
the
same
dollar
amounts
as
are
involved
here.
then
would
the
other
two
joint
owners,
joint
tenants,
have
a
claim
against
the
bank
under
arkansas
law?
chief
justice
burger
because
each
of
the
three
had
authorized
every
one
of
the
three
to
do
precisely
that.
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
know
that
they
authorized
the
bank
to
honor
any
check
that
any
one
of
them
signed,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
burger
no,
your
time
has
expired,
i
guess.
