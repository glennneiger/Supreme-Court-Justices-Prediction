mr.
terry
f.
wynne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
is
slightly
different
from
that
which
the
government
has
posed
to
the
court.
the
issue
is
whether
the
national
bank
of
commerce
is
personally
liable
to
the
irs
for
refusing
to
honor
the
notice
of
levy
served
upon
it.
and
to
determine
whether
nbc
is
personally
liable
or
not
we
have
to
do
a
two-step
review.
the
national
bank
of
commerce
would
have
to
honor
a
levy
if
it
were
in
possession
of
property
or
rights
to
district
court
belonging
to
mr.
reeves.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
i
do
not
have
any
arkansas
case
law
or
statutory
law
that
protects
the
bank.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
but
only
from
payments
made
to
co-depositors.
if
it
honors
withdrawal
requests
of
any
depositors,
it
is
protected
from
liability
to
co-depositors.
but
the
irs
is
not
a
co-depositor
on
this
account,
and
in
that
sense
the
national
bank
of
commerce
has
no
assurance
from
any
state
authority
that
it
would
not
be
exposed
to
that
liability.
so
we
do
a
twofold
inquiry
to
determine
if
national
bank
of
commerce
can
be
personally
liable.
first
we
determine
whether
it's
in
possession
of
property
or
rights
to
property
belonging
to
mr.
reeves,
and
we
look
to
state
law
to
determine
that.
and
the
answer
to
that
first
inquiry
is,
no,
we're
not
in
possession
of
any
such
property
or
rights
to
property.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
they
wouldn't
have
any
claim
under
the
particular
statutes
for
a
wrongful
levy
of
any
nature.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
i
don't...
of
course,
i
can't
speak
for
the
negotiable
instruments
laws
that
might
be
applicable
to
the
check
itself,
but
that
is
a
potential
conversion
of
those
funds,
and
conceivably
then
the
co-depositors
could
pursue
their
remedy
against
both
the
taxpayer
and
the
irs.
beyond
the
question
of
whether
mr.
reeves
owns
property
or
has
a
right
to
property,
to
impose
personal
liability
we've
got
to
determine
the
value
of
that
property.
so
even
if
you
accept
the
government's
argument
that
this
right
to
withdraw,
better
called
a
power
to
withdraw
because
it's
not
necessarily
a
right
if
it's
the
co-depositor's
own
money,
but
if
he
does
have
a
power
to
make
withdrawals
which
would
be
honored
by
the
bank,
what's
that
worth?
what's
its
value?
that's
got
to
be
determined
to
impose
liability
on
the
national
bank
of
commerce.
the
first
place
to
look
to
answer
the
first
question
i
posed
is,
of
course,
the
state
law,
and
we
look
at
first
the--
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
--the
national
bank
of
commerce
was
required
by
statute
to
honor
withdrawals
made
by
him.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
yes,
he
could.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
that's
right.
we
would
honor
any
withdrawal
request
from
mr.
reeves
to
the
full
balance
of
the
account.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
that's
correct.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
vis
a
vis
the
bank.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
to
the
extent
of
being
able
to
withdraw
all
the
moneys
from
the
account,
each
of
them
did
have
that
power
to
make
the
withdrawal
request.
but
to
the
extent
of
retaining
the
sums
once
they
got
the
money
in
their
possession,
we
don't
know
that.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
the
first
one
that
got
there
would
get
it.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
they
would
have
the
rights
to
conversion
and
their
ownership
rights
under
arkansas
law,
but
they
would
not
have
any
action
against
the
bank
because
the
statute
authorizes
the
bank
to
make
the
payments
and
protects
the
bank
if
it
does.
now,
that
of
course
is
clearly...
that
approach
to
the
analysis
of
the
joint
account
was
clearly
set
forth
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court
in
black
versus
black,
where
it
determined
that
these
joint
account
statutes
were
passed
for
the
bank's
protection
and
did
not
create
any
title
or
any
ownership.
so
the
simple
fact
that
mr.
reeves
is
named
on
this
joint
account
under
arkansas
law
creates
in
him
no
property
right.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
reading
that
from
black
versus
black,
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
in
which
the
court
specifically
said
that
these
statutes
invest
no
title,
but
were
passed
to
protect
the
bank
honoring
the
withdrawal
request
from
the
one
co-depositor.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
they
could
have
been
passed
for
that
reason.
they
could
have
been
passed
for
several
other
reasons.
but
i
have
only
the
arkansas
supreme
court's
decision
to
rely
on.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
i
think
it's
exclusive
of
the
question
of
whether
the
joint
statute,
joint
account
statute,
created
any
title
or
ownership,
as
it
specifically
excludes
title
or
ownership.
but
it
is
not
exclusive
of
anything
beyond
that
particular
exclusion.
black
v.
black
specifically
addressed
the
question
of
whether
money
in
a
joint
account...
the
fact
that
money
was
in
a
joint
account
determined
any
ownership
interests,
that
one
fact
alone.
and
in
black
v.
black
the
supreme
court
said
it
does
not.
you
have
to
look
beyond
the
face
of
the
account
to
determine
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
where
the
deposits
came
from,
and
those
sorts
of
facts.
and
that
was
also
recognized
by
the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit
in
its
opinion.
those
are
the
only
things
we
do
know
at
this
point,
is
that
roy
reeves
is
named
along
with
ruby
and
neva
on
two
joint
accounts,
a
savings
account
and
a
checking
account.
we
know
that
under
arkansas
law
nbc
would
be
required
to
honor
withdrawal
requests
made
by
him.
we
don't
know
anything
more.
that
was
the
analysis
that
the
eighth
circuit
used
in
looking
at
whether
there
was
a
state-created
property
right
which
is
required
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
the
eighth
circuit
correctly
concluded
that
there
has
been
no
establishment
of
any
state
property
right.
the
government
has
failed
to
provide
us
enough
evidence
or
information
to
determine
whether
there
exists
any
property
or
right
to
property,
and
that's
their
burden.
the
eighth
circuit
then
correctly
found
itself
to
be
in
accord
with
stock
yards
bank,
which
was
a
very
similar
situation
dealing
with
savings
bonds
instead
of
a
joint
bank
account.
but
in
stock
yards
bank
the
savings
bonds
were
held
in
joint
names
of
husband
and
wife,
and
the
federal
regulations
applicable
to
them
said
that
invests
no
title,
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
it's
identical
to
arkansas
law
in
that
concept.
and
in
stock
yards
bank
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
the
simple
fact
of
joint
title
did
not
determine
any
property
interests
or
rights
to
property.
so
we
have
two
circuits
in
accord
at
this
point.
as
the
eighth
circuit
noted,
its
decision
is
not
going
to
be
in
conflict
with
any
other
circuits,
and
it
specifically
reviewed
decisions
of
the
second,
fifth,
and
ninth
circuits,
which
the
government,
by
the
way,
submits
are
in
conflict.
but
the
second
circuit
case
of
u.s.
versus
sterling
national
was
an
offset
case.
the
bank
claimed
not
to
be
required
to
honor
the
levy
because
it
had
a
right
of
offset
or
set-off
against
the
account
deposits.
there
was
no
question
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
deposit
itself.
the
tax
debtor
owned
all
of
the
deposits.
similarly,
in
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
--our
bank
is
a
relatively
small
bank,
but
since
1959
we've
taken
this
posture.
my
partner
mr.
matthews
rendered
that
opinion
based
on
stock
yards
bank
at
that
time.
our
bank
only
gets
three
to
four
levies
of
a
joint
nature
per
year.
we
get
additional
levies,
but
normally
it's
clear
how
the
title
is
held
or
the
tax
liability
is
joint.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
that's
correct.
now,
the
only
pertinent
cases
that
i've
been
able
to
review
or
that
the
government
has
produced
in
similar
situations
where
the
government
or
irs
was
attempting
to
levy
on
joint
accounts,
the
government
either
accepted
or
was
required
to
bear
a
burden
of
showing
more
than
the
joint
account
title.
and
the
cases
specifically
cited
by
the
government
are
u.s.
versus
equitable
trust,
district
court
of
maryland...
the
government
produced
the
agreement
of
the
parties
and
produced
deposit
records,
produced
testimony
of
witnesses
to
establish
the
ownership
of
the
money
in
the
joint
accounts.
and
this
is
what
we
say
is
the
government's
burden
in
this
case.
it's
got
to
demonstrate
whose
money
is
in
this
bank
before
we're
required
to
honor
this
levy.
it's
a
burden
that
we
can't
accept,
nor
can
we
carry,
because
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
that's
right,
the
levy
procedure
is
just
not...
it's
ill
suited
for
this.
perhaps
a
section
7403
lien
foreclosure
proceeding
or
an
equity
procedure
is
much
better
suited
for
purposes
of--
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
--never
had
one,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
do
i
know
of
any
that
have
occurred?
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
anywhere?
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
tyson
versus
u.s.
as
i
understand
it
was
a
7403.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
it
is.
it's
very
easy
for
them.
but
as
noted
in
the
stock
yards
bank
case
and
as
noted
in
this
court's
decision
in
rodgers,
the
levy
procedure
is
just
not
very
well
adapted
to
determining
property
interests,
and
our
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
that.
we've
got
an
arkansas
law
that
says
this
demonstrates
no
title.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
i
believe
so.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
well,
they
call
themselves
a
full
service
bank,
and
we
have
requests
from
our
depositors
and
we're
making
the
services
available.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
competition.
that's
the
competitive
market,
of
course.
we
continue
to
make
these
available.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
that's
right,
that's
right.
they
want
it
for
the
convenience
of
having
a
husband
and
wife
each
draw
checks,
or
perhaps
this
was
a
mother,
son,
and
daughter-in-law,
that
convenience.
but
that
convenience
doesn't
tell
us
ownership,
and
it
therefore
doesn't
tell
us
what's
subject
to
levy
and
it
doesn't
tell
us
what
national
bank
of
commerce
should
have
given
them,
if
anything.
and
accordingly,
it
shouldn't
put
national
bank
of
commerce
in
a
liability
posture.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
that's
correct.
that
would
be
our
statutory
obligation,
to
make
that
payment
on
his
withdrawal
request.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
it'd
make
none
at
all.
that
would
then
be
the
classic
situation
described
in
the
arkansas
statute,
a
withdrawal
request
or
a
check
written
by
a
co-depositor.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
i
do.
the
irs,
while
it
may
stand
in
the
shoes
of
a
tax
debtor,
is
not
the
tax
debtor.
and
for
purposes
of
arkansas
law
we
are
only
insulated
from
any
liability
if
we
honor
the
request
of
a
depositor.
we
don't
think
that
we
would
be
insulated
from
a
levy
payment
to
the
irs.
more
importantly,
let
me
focus
again
on
this
case,
which
is
a
personal
liability
action,
as
opposed
to
a
levy,
as
far
as
a
levy
enforcement
procedure.
the
burden
again
is
proof
that
we
were
in
possession
of
property
or
rights
to
property
belonging
to
the
tax
debtor,
and
there's
absolutely
no
proof
of
that.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
we
feel
that
they
would
because
it
would
be
a
breach
of
the
contractual
agreement
between
depositors
and
the
bank.
they
place
that--
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
--well,
i
misunderstood
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
no.
if
roy
reeves
had
written
a
check
payable
to
the
irs
for
his
tax
debt--
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
--that's
correct.
well,
let
me
re-comment
on
that.
we
don't
know
whether
they
had
authorized
him
to
write
checks
and
pay
the
irs.
we
simply
know
that--
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
--well,
we
simply
know
that
he
is
named
on
this
joint
account,
and
the
statute
allows
the
bank
to
recognize
those.
but
we
don't
know
whether
neva
and
ruby
have
told
roy,
you
can
draw
checks
on
this
account,
or
not.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
that's
exactly
right,
that's
exactly
right.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i've
concluded.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
it
does
not.
thank
you.
mr.
terry
f.
wynne
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
