justice
o'connor
mr.
lauber,
if
you're
right
and
there
are
post-levy
remedies
available,
i
assume
they're
only
available
to
the
person
who
says
you've
taken
my
property,
and
that
individual
would
have
to
initiate
any
judicial
proceeding
or
request
for
administrative
review?
justice
o'connor
no.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
there
are
other
people
here
who
claim
they
own
part
of
this
money.
justice
o'connor
a
mother
and
a
sister,
perhaps.
it
would
be
up
to
them
to
initiate
any
post-levy
judicial
action
or
request
for
administrative
review.
justice
o'connor
now,
how
would
they
even
have
notice
of
it
if
there'd
been
a
levy?
i
mean,
what
real
protection
is
there
for
these
people?
justice
o'connor
it
just
seems
so
circular
as
you
phrase
it
in
that
way.
if
somebody,
if
the
third
party
claimant
has
to
prove
that
it's
wrongful
and
the
way
you
prove
it
is
that
that
person
in
fact
owned
the
money,
then
i
don't
understand
why
the
statute
doesn't
tell
you
in
the
first
place
that
the
government
can't
get
it.
section
6331
says
that
the
administrative
levy
can
be
made
upon
property
and
rights
to
property
belonging
to
the
taxpayer.
and
if
it
didn't
belong
to
him,
then
how
do
you
have
the
authority?
justice
o'connor
but
that
depends
entirely
on
looking
at
the
question
as
to
against
whom
did
the
taxpayer
have
the
right.
the
bank
certainly
had
the
right
to
pay
it
over,
but
the
taxpayer
didn't
have
a
right
to
take
all
the
money
as
against
his
mother
and
sister
or
wife
and
mother
or
whoever
it
was.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
problem
is
that
the
statute,
the
statute,
mr.
lauber,
is
not
written
as
though
it's
a
provisional
remedy.
it
says
you
can
levy
if
it's
property
or
right
to
property
belonging
to
the
taxpayer.
justice
o'connor
but
isn't
that
an
unenforceable
expectancy,
if
you're
just
designated
as
a
beneficiary
of
a
life
insurance
policy,
whereas
here
what
the
third
party
says
is,
i
own
it.
it's
not
an
expectancy.
justice
o'connor
it
would
be
perfectly
logical
to
reach
the
result
you're
asking
if
the
only
remedy
the
third
party
claimant
had
was
a
remedy
against
the
taxpayer
himself
for
someone
misusing
it.
but
when
you
conceive
that
there's
a
remedy
against
the
government
for
wrongful
levy,
that's
where
it
seems
to
get
sort
of
circular.
justice
o'connor
mr.
lauber,
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
hold
in
effect
that
arkansas
law
did
not
give
the
taxpayer
a
right
to
withdraw
the
money,
that
it
gave
the
bank
a
defense
if
it
paid
it
out,
that's
all?
justice
o'connor
mr.
wynne,
do
you
think
if
the
bank
had
just
gone
ahead
and
paid
the
check
to
the
irs
when
the
levy
was
made,
that
the
bank
would
have
had
a
defense
as
against
its
depositor,
the
taxpayer,
and
his
wife
and
mother?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
have
that
statute
that
says
the
bank
is
protected.
