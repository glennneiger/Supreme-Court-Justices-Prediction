but
under
state
law
who
owned
that
money?
justice
jr.
are
you
saying
that
the
ownership
is
immaterial
to
the
right
of
the
government
by
administrative
levy
to
take
it?
justice
jr.
as
long
as
he's
got
some
property
interest.
justice
jr.
mr.
shapiro,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
the
other
two
parties
who
have
an
interest
in
this
joint
account,
the
mother
and
sister,
would
have
to
bring
sort
of
an
action
against
the
united
states
to
recover
whatever
amounts
of
the
account
they
own.
is
there
a
statute
that
authorizes
them?
justice
jr.
there
is
an
administrative
remedy?
justice
jr.
that
may
be
in
your
brief.
justice
jr.
which
is
authorized
by
statute?
justice
jr.
you
say
you
can't
recall
any
specific
case.
i
understood
you
to
say,
responding
to
my
earlier
question,
that
there
was
a
statute
that
authorized
in
this
case
the
mother
and
sister
to
bring
some
sort
of
administrative
procedure
to
recover
their
property.
justice
jr.
7426.
justice
jr.
the
statute
requires
her
to
prove
two
things,
as
i
read
it:
one,
that
she
had
an
interest
in
the
property;
and
two,
that
the
levy
was
wrongful.
they're
separate
requirements,
separated
by
an
"and".
