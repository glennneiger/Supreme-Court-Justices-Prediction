they'd
find
out
rather
dramatically
when
they
tried
to
draw
a
check
on
the
account.
justice
rehnquist
your
position
here
is
that
the
administrative
levy
allows
the
government
to
levy
on
property
which
it
could
not
retain
in
some
instances
defending
a
wrongful
levy
action?
justice
rehnquist
you
think
the
law
permits
you
to
become
a
stakeholder
of
the
property
against
the
will
of
anybody
who
has
an
interest
in
it?
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
government
has
the
funds
in
hand,
does
the
government
take
the
money
at
that
time
and
pay
it
into
the
treasury,
so
that
the
winner
in
a
wrongful
levy
action
has
to
file
a
claim
against
the
government,
or
does
the
government
actually
hold
the
money
in
the
bank?
justice
rehnquist
the
bank
discharges
its
liability
by
issuing
the
money
to
the
drawer,
doesn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
your
version
of
it.
what
justice
stevens
is
reading
suggests
that
it's
a
twofold
requirement.
justice
rehnquist
many
levies
that
turn
out
ultimately
to
be
wrongful
under
your
view
of
the
statute
were
nonetheless
proper
when
administratively
made.
justice
rehnquist
under
your
theory,
it's
really
two
different
property
analyses.
the
property
that
you
levy
on
at
the
time
of
the
administrative
levy
is
not
the
same
property
that
you're
talking
about
in
the
wrongful--
justice
rehnquist
--but
then
how
can
that
sort
of
a
levy
ever
be
termed
wrongful,
because
there's
no
question
that
the
man
had
the
right
to
withdraw?
you
don't
need
a
proceeding
later
to
decide
that.
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
effect
you're
saying
that
the
administrative
levy
proceeding
just
won't
be
allowed
in
this
situation,
because
a
levy
i
suppose
always
acts
ex
parte,
until
you
can
have
a
hearing
at
any
rate?
