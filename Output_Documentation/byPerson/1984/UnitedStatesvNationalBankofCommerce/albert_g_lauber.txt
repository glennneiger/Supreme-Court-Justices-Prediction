mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
here
involves
the
power
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
levy
on
a
joint
bank
account
where
only
one
of
the
co-depositors
is
indebted
to
the
irs
for
unpaid
taxes.
the
delinquent
taxpayer
here
is
one
roy
reeves,
who
owes
the
irs
about
$800.
roy
has
a
checking
account
and
a
savings
account
at
the
respondent
bank,
titled
jointly
in
his
name
and
the
name
of
ruby
and
neva
reeves,
who
we
understand
to
be
roy's
mother
and
wife.
these
bank
accounts
are
typical
of
joint
bank
accounts
in
most
jurisdictions.
that
is,
each
depositor
is
entitled
to
withdraw
any
amount
up
to
the
full
outstanding
balance
from
the
account,
without
notice
to
his
co-depositors.
the
bank
likewise
is
required
to
honor
any
withdrawal
request
that
roy
might
make,
again
up
to
the
full
outstanding
balance,
absent
written
instructions
from
the
other
depositors
not
to
pay.
arkansas
law
also
provides
that
the
bank's
payment
to
any
one
depositor
immunizes
it
from
claims
by
the
other
depositors
to
the
money
thus
paid
out.
in
short,
as
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
stated,
at
the
time
the
bank
received
the
notice
of
levy
roy
could
have
withdrawn
any
amount
he
wished
from
these
joint
accounts
and
used
it
to
pay
his
federal
tax
bill,
and
his
co-depositors
would
have
had
no
lawful
claim
against
the
bank.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
they
might
have
a
complaint
against
him,
and
as
i
will
explain
shortly,
they
would
have
a
very
similar
claim
against
the
irs.
but
that
in
our
view
does
not
negate
the
fact
that
roy
had
a
right
to
property
that
the
irs
could
levy
on.
our
position
is
simply
that
whatever
roy
could
do
with
respect
to
the
account
unilaterally,
the
irs
can
do
by
virtue
of
its
levy
power.
and
that
we
think
follows
from
the
well-established
proposition
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--if
his
wife
had
a
big
pile
of
cash?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
if
the
understanding
between
them
was
that
he
had
free
access
to
that
money,
yes,
we
say
the
irs
could
levy
upon
it.
but
she
could
then
come
into
court
in
a
wrongful
levy
action
and
contend
that
he
misappropriated
her
funds,
but
that
would
be
a
question
as
to
ultimate
ownership.
here
the
right
to
property
we're
levying
upon
is
the
right
to
withdraw
the
money.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
we
think
that
here
the
equivalent
of
that
public
acknowledgment
is
in
effect,
because
under
state
law
and
the
banking
contracts
involved
roy
had
the
right
to
withdraw
all
that
money
without
notifying
his
co-depositors.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
you
could
put
it
that
way,
yes.
since
roy
had
the
right
to
get
the
money,
we
have
the
right
to
levy
upon
the
money.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
question
of
who
owns
the
money
in
the
ultimate
sense
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
that
would
be
determined
after
the
levy
in
a
post-seizure
hearing,
either
an
administrative
hearing
or
a
wrongful
levy
action.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
question...
the
resolution
of
all
possible
competing
claims
to
the
property
is
irrelevant
at
the
levy
stage
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
as
long
as
he's
got
the
right
to
pull
that
money
out
and
write
a
check
to
the
irs
for
it,
that's
right,
he
has
a
right
to
property.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
what
we're
levying
on,
his
right
to
withdraw
the
money
and
pay
it
to
the
irs.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it
depends.
the
wrongful
levy
action
would
be
brought
by
a
third
party
claimant.
that's
not
available
to
the
taxpayer.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
rodgers
case
a
few
terms
ago,
the
revenue
code
does
not
require
the
irs
to
notify
potential
third
party
claimants
of
a
levy
on
the
taxpayer's
property,
and
in
fact
the
irs
does
not
notify
them
because
it
typically
can't
know
who
they
are.
and
the
lower
courts
have
held
there's
no
constitutional
duty
of
the
irs
to
notify
such
people.
but
nevertheless,
in
real
life
they
would
find
out.
first
of
all,
state
law,
state
banking
law
or
state
banking
regulations
might
well
require
the
bank
to
notify
depositors,
co-depositors,
of
a
levy
on
the
account.
even
absent
a
requirement
of
state
law,
most
banks
i
would
think
in
following
customary
business
good
practice
would
notify
co-depositors.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that's
the
ultimate
thing,
is
these
people,
one
presumes
they
know.
you
don't
lightly
open
a
joint
bank
account
with
somebody.
presumably
it's
either
your
spouse
or
your
friend
or
someone,
and
you'll
find
out
about
it.
you
write
a
check
and
it
bounces,
or
you
have
the
statement
showing
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
if
we
had
sought
to
foreclose
our
tax
lien
on
the
joint
account--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--since
the
revenue
code
was
enacted,
and
it
was
in
existence
even
before
the
income
tax
law.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
the
irs
has
routinely
used
levies
as
the
primary
collection
device
for
many
years,
because
it's
always
been
the
most
efficient
way
to
collect
taxes,
particularly
when
you
have
a
bank.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i'd
hate
to
say
that.
but
without--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--if
that's
what
he
says,
i'd
have
to
say
he's--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--in
any
event,
now
things
have
changed.
typically
today--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
justice
brennan,
again,
i
don't...
it
has
always
been
my
understanding
that
levies
have
been
since
time
immemorial
the
primary
collection
device.
i
think
that
the
number
of
them
have
increased
recently
because
now
it's
all
done
by
computer.
the
computer
generates
the
notice
of
levy
to
the
bank.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it's
like
in
philadelphia.
but
i
think
now
the
irs
serves
literally
millions
of
levies
every
year,
and
about
a
third
of
them
go
to
banks.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
they
have
an
administrative
remedy
and
a
judicial
remedy.
they
can
file
a
claim
with
the
irs
demanding
return
of
the
property.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
yes,
there
is.
in
section
63--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--43(b)
of
the
code.
and
if
the
irs
doesn't
grant
relief
that
way,
then
they
go
to
court
in
a
wrongful
levy
action
against
the
government.
but
let
me
point
out--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--by
statute.
that
was
the
provision
congress
made
for
determining
these
ownership
claims.
let
me
point
out
the
similarity
of
that
remedy
to
what
they
would
have
if
roy
himself
had
just
withdrawn
the
money.
say
roy
wrote
a
check
for
the
whole
balance
in
the
account,
as
he
was
entitled
to
do,
and
he
used
it
to
pay
for
his
groceries
or
his
gambling
debts
or
his
tax
bill.
had
he
done
that,
ruby
and
neva
would
have
had
to
file
a
claim
in
state
court
for
return
of
the
money,
contending
that
roy
wrongfully
spent
money
that
was
theirs.
but
the
revenue
code
gives
them
an
identical
remedy
in
the
levy
context,
except
that
it
runs
not
against
roy,
but
against
the
irs,
which
steps
into
roy's
shoes.
they
can
file
a
claim
with
the
irs
or
go
to
court
to
get
the
money
back.
so
they're
no
worse
off
at
all.
they
simply
have
a
different
defendant
in
their
action
for
return
of
the
funds
in
question.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
is
our
position,
and
i
think
most
courts
have
so
held,
that
the
plaintiff
in
a
wrongful
levy
action,
like
any
plaintiff
in
any
civil
action,
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
levy
was
wrongful.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
our
contention
would
be
that
in
that
action,
that
if
on
the
face
of
the
account
roy
had
the
power
to
withdraw
all
the
money
and
pay
it
to
the
irs--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
would
be
up
to
them
to
prove
some
facts--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--no,
if
they
can
show
that
the
property
was
not
roy's
property,
but
rather
their
property,
that
would
make
the
levy
wrongful.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
yes.
that
would
have
to
be
their
contention,
that
even
though
he
had
the
authority
to
withdraw
the
money,
they
had
some
understanding
between
themselves
that
it
was
really
their
money.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
if
they
could
prove
that
the
money
he
had
the
right
to
withdraw
was
in
fact
theirs,
they
would
prevail
on
the
wrongful
levy
action.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
against
the
government.
but
that's
what
they'd
have
to
prove
against
him
if
he
withdrew
the
money.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
it's
not
that
we
know
we
can't
retain
it,
but
there's
a
possibility
that
there
may
be
other
claims
to
the
property,
either
known
or
unknown,
which
might
prevent
us
from
ultimately
holding
onto
the
property.
it's
a
provisional
measure.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
this
court
has
said
as
much.
the
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
that
the
need
for
swift
collection
of
the
federal
revenues
means
that
property
rights
must
yield
provisionally
to
governmental
need.
and
the
point
is,
the
irs
must
levy
on
the
property,
get
the
funds
secured
and
the
revenues
protected,
and
then
people
can
fight
out
about
who
really
owns
it.
but
in
the
meantime,
the
government
has
the
funds
in
hand
so
that
they
cannot
be
depleted
by
the
taxpayer
or
his
fellow
depositors.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
was
somewhat
less.
i
think
the
total
on
deposit
was
$1500
and
we
levied
on
$857,
which
was
roy's
tax
liability.
so
we
didn't
get
all
of
it?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
just
a
little
over
half.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
believe
the
practice
is
for
the
bank
to
pay
over
the
money
to
the
irs,
and
what
the
irs
does
with
it,
frankly,
i'm
not
sure.
but
it
would
be
incumbent
on
the
third
party
claimant
to
file
a
claim
first
with
the
irs
to
get
the
money
back.
and
they
can
simply
issue
it.
they
don't
have
to
go
and
get
an
appropriation.
they
can
just
issue
the
money
back.
if
they
find
the
levy
was
wrongful,
i.e.,
not
on
the
taxpayer's
property,
they
can
simply
refund
that
or
credit
it
to
the
third
party
claimant.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it
does
in
the
sense
that
if
it's
in
a
bank
account
of
the
local
irs
office
it
is
notionally
in
the
treasury.
but
it
doesn't
like
get
mailed
to
washington.
the
funds
are
there
to
be
paid
out
by
the
local
district
director
if
he
determines,
upon
a
claim
by
the
third
party--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
that
is
not
inconceivable
to
me.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
the
point
is,
if
the
third
party
claimant
comes
in
with
a
claim
for
the
money
and
can
show
that
this
money
didn't
belong
to
the
taxpayer,
he
will
get
the
money
back
immediately,
with
interest
if
appropriate.
our
position
in
this
case
reflects
the
well-established
proposition
that
the
irs
in
a
levy
proceeding
steps
into
the
shoes
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer.
that
is,
the
irs
can
do
whatever
with
respect
to
the
account
that
the
taxpayer
himself
could
do.
here,
because
roy
had
the
power--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--but
he
could
do
it
lawfully,
because
he
had
the
right--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--but
all
the
law
gives
them
would
be
a
claim
in
state
court
against
him.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
if
he
has
the
right--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think
you'd
probably
have...
it's
our
position
that
you
can.
you
may
have
to
fight
it
out
under
state
law
whether
you
violate
some
understanding
with
your
co-depositor,
but
you
certainly
have
a
claim
to
do
that.
you
have
a
right
to
withdraw
the
money.
no
one
can
stop
you
from
withdrawing
that
money
from
the
account
and
spending
it,
and
all
the
co-depositors
have
left
is
a
claim
against
you
to
show
that
that
was
improper,
that
it
was
their
property,
not
your
property.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly
right.
and
state
law
provides
that
once
the
bank
pays
the
withdrawer,
here
roy,
they
are
immune
from
claims
by
the
other
depositors
to
the
funds
paid
out
accordingly.
and
therefore,
the
bank's
most
logical
course
of
action
is
to
pay
out
in
response
to
the
levy
and
simply
have
its
duties
at
an
end,
and
then
the
third
party
claimants
can
fight
out
in
a
wrongful
levy
action
or
a
claim
for
credit
as
to
who
ultimately
owns
the
property.
but
the
point
is,
because
roy
had
the
right
to
withdraw
the
money
from
the
account
and
pay
it
to
the
irs
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
we
have
a
right
to
levy
on
the
money
and
require
the
bank
to
pay
us
directly,
rather
than
paying
roy.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
justice
stevens,
every
case
would
be
of
that
type.
what
one
must
keep
in
mind
is
the
distinction
between
a
levy,
which
is
a
provisional
remedy...
all
the
levy
does
is
say,
you
have
a
right
to
the
property,
we
are
levying
on
the
property
pending
further
determination.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
okay,
the
funds
have
been
escrowed,
in
effect.
and
that
doesn't
determine
any
rights
to
the
property,
to
ownership
of
the
property.
the
fact
that
the
irs
levies
on
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
will
get
to
keep
the
money.
that
depends
on
whether
another
claimant
can
come
in
and
prove
under
state
law
that
they
really
owned
that
portion
of
the
money.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i'm
not
aware...
this
is
not
litigated
very
often
because
until
the
decision
below
nobody
ever
dreamed
of,
no
bank
ever
dreamed
of
declining
to
honor
a
levy
on
a
joint
bank
account.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no.
we
have,
the
irs
has
figures
that
we
levy
on
about
200,000
joint
bank
accounts
every
year.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no.
we
got
that
from
irs
files.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--there
is
no...
the
figures
we
have
given
are
derived
from
irs
files,
and
our
office
traditionally
consults
our
clients
in
litigation,
and
typically
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
to
show
how
important
the
case
is
administratively,
we
do
put
evidence
about
the
number
of
cases
pending,
the
number
of
cases
raising
the
issue,
to
show
how
important
the
case
is.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i
think
probably
there
is
publicly
available
information
about
the
number
of
levies
the
irs
issues
every
year.
they
couldn't
tell
you
who
the
people
were
because
of
privacy.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
if
that's
publicly
available
or
not,
or
whether
it
could
be
reached
through,
the
statistics
could
be
reached
by
an
foia
request
or
something
like
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
there
is.
that's
section
7426.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
of
the
revenue
code,
which
provides
a
wrongful
levy
action
in
district
court
for
a
third
party
who
contends
that
the
government
has
seized
property
of
his
for
another's
taxes.
section
6343(b)
provides
the
administrative
relief.
what
justice
stevens
asked
me
was
whether
i
could
give
him
cases
where
people
had
actually
invoked
this
remedy
in
court
and
succeeded.
the
only
case
i'm
aware
of,
because
as
i
said
it
hasn't
come
up
a
great
deal
because
people
didn't
litigate
about
this
until
the
decision
below,
is
a
district
court
case
called
douglas
v.
united
states.
we
cite
it
in
our
brief.
that
was
a
situation
where
the
mother,
a
mother
and
her
son
had
a
joint
bank
account
and
the
irs
levied
on
the
account
to
satisfy
the
son's
liability,
and
the
mother
brought
a
wrongful
levy
action,
i
think
some
three
years
later,
and
her
case
was
dismissed
because
she
failed
to
comply
with
the
statute
of
limitations
on
a
wrongful
levy
action.
and
so
she
did
not
succeed,
but
she
could
very
well
have
had
she
brought
her
suit
in
a
timely
fashion
as
congress
provided.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
though
in
reality
it's
the
same
thing,
because
the
way
you
show
the
levy
was
wrongful
was
to
show
that
the
levy
was
made
upon
property
that
did
not
belong
to
the
taxpayer.
and
the
way
you
show
that
is
by
showing
that
the
property
really
belonged
to
you.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
a
levy
i
guess
could
be
wrongful
for
other
reasons
than
that
it
was
made
on
property
other
than
the
taxpayer's
property.
the
tax
assessment
could
be
invalid,
the
underlying
assessment
could
be
invalid,
and
there
could
be
other
defenses
like
that.
but
among
the
ways
you
can
prove
a
levy
is
wrongful
is
to
show
that
it
is
not
on
the
taxpayer's
property.
and
in
a
joint
account
it's
a
zero
sum
game;
it's
either
his
property
or
your
property.
there's
nobody
else
in
the
picture.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right,
because
we
were
levying
on
the
right
to
property
which
may
have
been
subject
to
other
competing
claims
by
other
people.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
belongs
to
him
because
he
has
the
right,
subject
to
possible
claims
by
other
people,
to
withdraw
that
money
and
pay
it
to
the
irs.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
he
may
or
may
not,
depending
on
what
they
can
prove.
and
the
point
is,
the
scheme
congress
set
up
is
that
the
irs
will
levy
provisionally
on
a
right
to
property
even
if
there
is
some
dispute
about
who
really
owns
it.
that
way
the
funds
are
secured.
then
there
will
be
a
post-seizure
hearing--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
way
we
interpret
those
words...
maybe
it
would
be
useful
to
go
back
to
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
bess,
where
that
involved
a
levy
on
the
cash
surrender
value
of
a
life
insurance
policy.
and
the
court
clearly
held
that
the
right
to
compel
payment
of
a
sum
to
one
is
a
right
to
property,
and
therefore,
because
the
insured
during
his
life
could
have
compelled
the
insurance
company
to
pay
him
the
cash
surrender
value,
we
could
levy
on
that.
now,
i
should
point
out
that
in
that
situation
other
people
could
very
well
be
prejudiced,
because
if
we
levied
on
the
cash
surrender
value
and
got
all
the
cash
out
the
policy
would
be
at
an
end.
the
beneficiaries
of
the
life
insurance
policy
would
get
no
proceeds
if
that
person
thereafter
died.
so
the
fact
that
there
may
be
other
third
parties
who
have
a
claim
to
the
money...
there
it
was
an
inchoate
or
contingent
claim--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--but
the
reason
congress
decided
that
it
was
better
to
defer
these
ownership
disputes
to
a
later
stage
is
because
the
irs
would
have
a
very
difficult
time
proving
in
every
levy
proceeding
who
owned
the
ultimate...
who
are
the
ultimate
owners
of
the
property.
who
owns
the
money
in
a
joint
bank
account
may
depend
on
who
put
the
money
in,
who
took
it
out,
whether
it's
used
to
pay
for
the
husband's
shoes
or
the
wife's
dresses.
the
irs
could
never
prove
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
certain
presumption
to
that
effect
as
well.
but
the
point
is
that
the
people
who
have
the
ability
to
show
who
owns
it
is
the
taxpayer.
the
irs
cannot
know
what
deals
co-depositors
have
made.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that
may
be
a
good
way
of
putting
it.
we're
levying
on
a
right
to
property.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
although
it
could
be
that,
although
the
person
has
a
right
to
property,
he
may
not
have
full
ownership
of
the
property
in
the
ultimate
sense,
other
people
can
show
they
have
competing
claims
to
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it's
not
really
circular.
it's
just
the
point
at
which
you
have
a
full-blown
hearing
about
who
owns
what,
and
what
congress
has
determined
is
that
the
levy
secures
the
property
and
that
there's
a
post-seizure
hearing
initiated
by
the
third
party
claimant
to
flush
out
all
the
state
law
issues
about
who
the
ultimate
owner
is.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
there
there
would
be
no
remedy
against
the
government.
it
would
be
against
roy.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
and
because
irs
has
now
taken
the
money.
that's
why
the
remedy
is
against--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
i
think
you're
right.
i
think
it
would
be
logical
to
think
that,
even
after
a
wrongful,
apparently
wrongful
levy,
the
third
party
might
still
possibly
be
able
to
sue
the
co-depositor
taxpayer
in
state
court
on
a
theory
that
he
was
the
beneficiary
of
this
payment
because
it
was
credited
against
his
tax
bill.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
arkansas
statutes,
banking
statutes,
give
each
co-depositor
the
right
to
withdraw
money
from
the
account.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
and
the
bank
must
pay,
absent
notification--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that's
right.
he
has
a
right
vis
a
vis
the
bank
to
withdraw
all
the
money.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
he
may
or
may
not
have,
depending
on
what--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
but
he
had
a
right
vis
a
vis
the
bank
to
get
the
money
in
his
hands.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
there
are
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
cases
involving
banks'
claimed
setoff,
where
the
bank
claimed
it
had
a
right
to
set
off
its
claim
against
the
account,
and
the
courts
held
that
as
long
as
the
guy
could
withdraw
the
money
the
bank
had
to
pay
it
out,
and
the
bank
could
then
assert
its
setoff
claim
in
a
wrongful
levy
action
later
on.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
then
i
would
agree
we
couldn't
levy.
if
his
right
to
withdraw
was
restricted,
either
by
a
court
injunction
or
by
some
annotation
on
the
signature
card--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
they
have
achieved--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
but
what
restricts
his
right
to
withdraw
the
money
vis
a
vis
the
bank
is
an
injunction
barring
the
bank
from
paying
the
money
out
to
him.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
our
position
is
that
arkansas
law
doesn't
govern
whether
what
roy
had
is
a
right
to
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
relevant
revenue
code
provisions.
and
those
words
appear
in
the
federal
statute,
and
our
position
is,
under
this
court's
decision
in
bess
and
other
cases,
the
right
to
compel
a
bank
to
pay
you
money
is
a
right
to
property
that
we
can
levy
on.
and
if
other
people
have
claims,
they
can
come
in
later
and
they'll
fight
it
out.
thank
you.
