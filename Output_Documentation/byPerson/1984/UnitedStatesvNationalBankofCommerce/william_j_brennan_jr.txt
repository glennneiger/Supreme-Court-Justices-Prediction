justice
jr.
all
of
the
claims
i
gather
could
have
been
resolved
if
the
government,
instead
of
an
administrative
levy
under
6331,
had
brought
a
judicial
suit
under
7403,
would
it
not?
justice
jr.
i
mean,
the
government...
if
you
had
done
that,
all
parties
with
claims
would
have
been
made
part
of
the
suit.
justice
jr.
tell
me,
how
long
has
this
administrative
levy
procedure
been
followed
by
irs?
justice
jr.
well,
is
bittker
wrong
when
he
says
as
late
as
1981
that
resort
to
the
administrative
levy
was
rare?
you've
given
us
some
statistics
in
the
brief
indicating
the
volume
of
the
administrative
levy
today,
but
what
was
it
10,
20
years
ago?
justice
jr.
you
think
bittker's
just
wrong
factually
when
he
said
that?
justice
jr.
that's
what
he
says.
you
have
to,
don't
you?
justice
jr.
it
gets
all
messed
up,
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
jr.
if
they
proved
that
would
they
prevail?
justice
jr.
against
the
government?
justice
jr.
has
your
bank
been
involved
with
many
7403
proceedings?
justice
jr.
never
had
one.
do
you
know
of
any?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
i
can't
imagine
why
the
government
would
ever
resort
to
7403
if
they're
right
about
the
availability
of
the
administrative
levy.
it's
too
easy.
justice
jr.
i
take
it
the
bank
would
have
to
be
a
party
to
a
7403,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
point,
i
gather,
is
that
arkansas
bank
law
obligates
the
bank
to
honor
any
check
drawn
by
a
depositor
on
the
account,
but
there's
no
obligation
under
arkansas
law
to
pay
anything
out
on
the
basis
of
an
administrative
levy
to
the
irs
because
it's
not
a
depositor
on
the
account.
