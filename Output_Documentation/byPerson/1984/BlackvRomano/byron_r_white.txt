justice
white
and
if
the
case
is
reversed,
as
you
would
like
it
to
be,
what
would
be
the
result?
justice
white
well,
do
i
take
it
that
it
would
not
satisfy
you
if
the
judge
said,
i
have
considered
alternatives
and
find
them
unsatisfactory,
and
20
years?
justice
white
would
that
satisfy
you
or
not?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
let's
assume
that
he
made
it
clear
that
he
has
considered
alternatives.
does
he
have
to
then
go
on
and
say
what
the
alternatives
are
and
why
he
rejected
them?
justice
white
not
necessarily?
is
that
part
of
your
case
or
isn't
it?
justice
white
i
understood
from
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
that
the
court
below
said
he
must
explain
his
reasons,
not
just
consider
alternatives,
but
he
must
explain.
justice
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
well
don't
run
the
two
things
together
so
fast.
i
asked
you
first,
would
it
be
enough
if
he
said,
i
have
considered
alternatives,
and
i
thought
you
said
it
probably
would.
justice
white
are
you
familiar
with
this
statement
in
a
case,
townsend
against
seay?
it
says
this.
"furthermore,
the
coequal
responsibilities
of
state
and
federal
judges
in
the
administration
of
federal
constitutional
law
are
such
that
we
think
the
district
judge
may
in
an
ordinary
case
in
which
there
has
been
no
articulation
of
a
legal
standard
properly
assume
that
the
state
trier
of
fact
applied
correct
standards
of
federal
law
to
the
facts.
"
here
is
a
silent
record.
the
judge
didn't
say
what
legal
standard
he
was
applying
in
revoking,
but
this
statement
in
townsend
against
seay
says
that
we
may
assume
that
he
applied
the
right
legal
standard.
so
may
we
assume
that
he
said
to
himself,
i
know
i
must
consider
alternatives?
i
have
read
gagnon
and
morrissey.
i
have
considered
alternatives.
i
just
don't
think
they
are...
they
are
just
not
a
satisfactory...
should
we...
can
we
assume
that,
or
must
we
put
on
the
record
the
legal
standard
he
is
applying?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
townsend
against
seay
was
long
after
that.
justice
white
yes,
but
you
are
not
complaining
about
the
revocation,
are
you?
you
are
complaining
about
what
they
did
to
him
after
they
revoked
it.
justice
white
you
are
not
saying
prohibition
shouldn't
have
been
revoked.
justice
white
so
you
think
that
chief
justice
warren
in
his
statement
in
townsend
against
seay
was
just
wrong.
you
should
never
assume
that
a
state
judge
knows
what
the
law
is.
you
should
always
assume
that...
you
will
assume
the
contrary
unless
he
states
it.
justice
white
well,
there
certainly
was
in
townsend
against
seay.
