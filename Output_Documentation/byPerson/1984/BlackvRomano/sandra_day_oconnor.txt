justice
o'connor
and
the
defendant
at
that
hearing
had
an
opportunity
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
and
to
argue
against
the
revocation,
and--
justice
o'connor
--address
any
remarks
that
he
chose
to
make
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
sentence.
justice
o'connor
mr.
morris,
what
is
your
position?
is
it
that
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
and...
the
findings
of
fact
and
determination
to
revoke
probation
simply
implicitly
meets
a
requirement
that
alternatives
be
considered,
or
is
it
your
position
that
no
alternatives
need
be
considered,
period?
justice
o'connor
yes,
of
course,
counsel.
however,
in
bearden,
we
had
a
situation
of
a
person
who
was
unable
to
live
up
to
the
terms
of
probation
through
no
fault
of
his
own,
and
bearden
in
no
way
involved
a
probation
revocation
based
on
conduct
at
which
the
defendant
was
at
fault,
did
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
to
automatically
sentence
someone
to
the
original
sentence
that
is
imposed
after
the
finding
on
the
first
offense
after
the
probationer
commits
a
new
criminal
offense?
justice
o'connor
my
question,
though,
is
whether
you
think
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
to
send
someone
to
prison
on
the
original
sentence
which
was
on
appeal
when
the
probationer
commits
a
new
criminal
offense
in
violation
of
the
terms
of
probation.
justice
o'connor
is
that
fundamentally
unfair?
justice
o'connor
why
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
should
a
decision
to
reimpose
sentence
be
initially
supported
by
a
conclusion
that
you
are
compelled
to
find
that
probation
has
failed?
where
do
you
get
that
from
in
our
cases?
you
say
the
conclusion
was
not
compelled
that
probation
had
failed.
is
that
language
in
our
cases?
justice
o'connor
mr.
cherrick,
i
am
just
curious
about
one
more
point.
i
don't
think
i
agree
with
your
position
on
the
merits,
but
even
if
i
did,
do
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
correct
in
not
even
giving
the
court,
the
state
court
an
opportunity
to
place
its
findings
on
the
record
instead
of
just
dismissing
the
whole
proceeding?
justice
o'connor
counsel,
what
is
this
memorandum
of
findings
of
judge
whipple
on
page
107?
he
makes
a
whole
lot
of
findings
there.
