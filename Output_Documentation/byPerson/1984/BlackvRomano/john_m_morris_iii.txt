mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
respondent,
nicholas
romano,
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
in
november
of
1976
to
two
felony
counts
of
the
transfer
and
sale
of
a
controlled
substance.
the
record
indicates
that
romano
had
sought
to
trade
26
pounds
of
marijuana
to
a
person
who
turned
out
to
be
an
undercover
police
officer
in
exchange
for
heroin.
in
april
of
1977,
after
the
preparation
of
a
presentence
investigation,
a
hearing
was
held
before
the
circuit
judge,
the
state
circuit
judge
who
had
accepted
romano's
guilty
plea
on
the
issue
of
sentence,
and
at
that
hearing
romano's
attorneys
presented
testimony
and
evidence
which
sought
to
mitigate
the
offense
and
consequently
keep
romano
out
of
prison.
after
hearing
this
evidence,
the
court
observed
that
he
had
labored
with
this
case,
as
he
had
with
any
in
which
a
person
might
be
sent
to
prison,
and
the
court
also
remarked
that
romano's
past
track
record
was
not
very
good.
nevertheless,
the
court
said,
because
this
was
not
a
personal
crime,
a
crime
against
a
person,
he
was
inclined
to
and
would
grant
probation.
so
saying
the
court
sentenced
romano
to
two
concurrent
terms
of
20
years'
imprisonment,
suspended
the
execution
of
those
terms,
and
placed
romano
on
probation
for
a
term
of
five
years,
and
at
that
time
indicated
to
romano
that
in
all
probability
when
that
five
years
were
up
he
would
add
a
second
five-year
probation
term
for
a
total
of
ten
years'
probation
on
this
offense.
two
months
after
he
was
placed
on
probation,
a
car
driven
by
romano
struck
and
seriously
injured
a
young
man
outside
the
bar
where
romano
was
employed
as
a
bartender.
romano
did
not
after
the
accident
remain
at
the
scene
or
identify
himself.
instead,
he
absconded.
he
drove
away.
he
sought
to
conceal
his
car
at
the
home
of
his
employer
at
the
bar,
who
parenthetically
was
the
only
live
character
witness
at
his
sentencing
proceeding.
he
stayed
out
of
sight
for
some
eleven
or
twelve
hours,
and
then
finally
after
that
period
came
to
the
victim's
hospital
room
and
sought
to
blame
the
victim
for
the
accident.
at
the
revocation
hearing...
the
offense
of
driving
while
intoxicated
under
missouri
law
is
a
felony,
and
revocation
proceedings
were
instituted,
and
at
the
revocation
hearing,
the
only
issue
that
was
advanced
by
romano
and
his
attorneys
was
whether
he
was
guilty
of
leaving
the
scene
of
an
accident.
no
contention
whatsoever
was
made
by
evidence
or
by
argument
that
if
he
were
guilty,
that
he
should
no
be
and
could
not
be
sent
to
prison.
the
state
circuit
court,
the
judge
who
had
originally
heard
his
guilty
plea
and
made
the
decision
on
the
sentence,
heard
the
case,
concluded
in
written
findings
and
conclusions
that
he
had
indeed
committed
this
act,
and
based
upon
that,
stated
that
his
probation
was
revoked.
three
years
after
he
was
incarcerated,
romano
filed
the
first
of
a
series
of
state
and
federal--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--you
mean
the
range
of
punishment,
your
honor?
you
mean
the
range
of
punishment?
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
the
range
of
punishment
for
the
transfer
or
sale
of
controlled
substances--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--oh,
the
penalty
for
that
crime
is,
i
think,
in
the
vicinity
of
up
to
five
years'
imprisonment,
your
honor.
he
was
not...
oh--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--yes,
sir.
under
missouri
law,
that
is
the
range
of
punishment.
if
you
are
asking
whether
he
was
convicted
of
leaving
the
scene,
the
answer
is--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--excuse
me?
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
it
is
up
to
five
years
in
missouri,
yes.
in
any
case,
the
romano
respondent
filed
the
first
of
a
series
of
state
collateral
attacks,
which
ultimately
reached
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
was
summarily
denied.
now,
the
district
court
in
granting
romano's
federal
habeas
corpus
petition--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--mr.
romano,
of
course,
was
discharged
as
a
result
of
the
ruling
of
the
district
court.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
he
is
free.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
time
the
district
court
rendered
its
ruling,
romano
was
on
parole.
he
served
a
period
of
incarceration,
was
placed
on
parole,
and
the
effect
of
the
district
court's
decision
was
to
discharge
him
from
parole
supervision.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
he
served
approximately...
he
served
from...
approximately
five,
a
little
over
five
years,
i
believe.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
your
honor,
our
basic
contention
is
that...
and
as
i
will
get
into
in
much
more
detail
later,
is
that
the
revocation
hearing
was
entirely
valid,
and
that
being
the
case,
we
submit
that
he
should
be
restored
to
parole
supervision.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
it
is
rather
a
substantial
additional
period
of
time.
i
think
he
is
currently...
until
the
district
court's
decision
reversing
his...
overturning
his
revocation,
i
think
he
was
scheduled
to
be
on
parole
until
the
turn
of
the
century,
2000
or
thereabouts.
the
district
court
in
granting
this
habeas
corpus
petition
professed
to
find
in
this
court's
decisions
of
morrissey
versus
brewer
and
gagnon
versus
scarpelli
a
procedural
due
process
requirement
that
any
revoking
authority,
revoking
court
or
presumably
a
board
in
a
probation
or
parole
revocation
case
was
required
to
specify
on
the
records
that
it
considered
various
alternatives
to
incarceration,
which
the
district
court
said
included
driver
training
classes
and
public
service
and
restitution
and
such
like,
and
that
the
court
is
not
only
required
to
specify
that
it
considered
such
alternatives,
but
it
must
specify
as
to
why
it
rejected
them.
the
district
court
in
fact
said
if
this
was
not
done
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
revocation
that
the
revocation
is
not
only
invalid
but
perpetually
so.
the
district
court
refused
the
petitioner's
request
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
which
the
state
circuit
judge
might
have
been
called
to
testify
about
his
state
of
mind.
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
this,
what
we
submit
to
be
a
novel
principle
even
though
it
had
previously
rejected
a
similar
attempt
in
a
federal
probation
revocation
case
called
united
states
versus
burkhalter.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
after
the
hit
and
run
it
was
when
he
went
to
the
hospital
room
about
12
hours
later.
he
was
sentenced.
two
months
later
he
had
the
hit
and
run
accident.
he
left
the
scene,
and
about
12
hours
later
he
was
found
by
police
at
the
hospital
room
of
the
victim.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
of
that,
and
of
course
because
mr.
romano
absented
himself
for
eleven
hours,
we
have
no
idea
as
to
his
condition
when
he
was
driving,
which
is
not
a
direct
issue
in
this
case,
but
it
is
something--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--no,
your
honor,
it
wasn't
something
that
was
discussed.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
well,
that
is
a
matter
of
some
uncertainty,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
and
respondent
dispute,
and
missouri
law
really
hasn't
settled
whether
or
not,
for
example,
the
court
could
reduce
the
sentence
that
was
originally
imposed,
instead
of
20
years,
put
it
down
to
ten
years.
it
just
simply
hasn't
come
up
in
appellate
cases.
i
believe
it
is
safe
to
conclude
that
the
court
could
have
changed
the
terms
of
his
probation
or
imposed
some
other
sort
of
equitable
remedy,
not
that
there
is
any
direct
authority
for
it,
but
that
has
been
the
procedure
in
the
past.
there
has
been
no
problem
with
that.
the
petitioners
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
below
is
not
only
not
supported
by
morrissey
and
gagnon
but
is
directly
contrary
to
it
and
is
not
consistent
with
any
reasonable
due
process
analysis.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
your
honor,
i
really
have
no
statistics
on
the
subject.
it
is
just
something...
i
think
as
a
matter
of
general
practice
it
is
frequently
done.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
yes,
i
think
that
is
fair
to
say.
i
don't
have
any...
i
am
not
an
attorney
who
does
probation
revocations
at
the
trial
level,
but
i
have
that
impression.
in
morrissey
and
gagnon,
this
court
acknowledged
a
significant
liberty
interest
in
revocation
and
probation
and
parole.
and
the
court
said,
i
think
perfectly
correctly,
that
there
are
two
stages
to
a
revocation
decision,
the
first
being
whether
a
person
is
guilty
of
the
alleged
probation
or
parole
violation,
and
the
second
is
what
this
court
called
the
predictive
and
discretionary
decision
as
to
whether
he
should
be
sent
to
prison
or
what
other
disposition
should
be
made
of
this
person
because
of
the
violation.
the
court
stated
that
both
of
these
questions
involve
factual
bases.
obviously,
the
first
decision,
the
guilt
decision
is
almost
entirely
factual,
but
even
when
one
is
talking
about
a
decision
on
sentencing
after
one
finds
that
a
violation
of
probation
has
been
committed,
this
court
said
it
is
important
to
know
not
only
that
some
violation
was
committed,
but
also
to
know
accurately
how
many
and
how
serious
the
violations
were.
thus,
this
court
established
a
framework,
a
procedural
framework
whereby
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
facts
pertinent
to
both
these
issues
would
be
reliably
and
fairly
determined.
this
court
described
the
remedy,
the
procedure
it
was
requiring
under
the
due
process
clause
in
morrissey
as
an
informal
hearing
structured
to
assure
that
the
finding
of
a
parole
violation
would
be
based
on
verified
facts,
and
that
the
exercise
of
discretion
would
be
informed
by
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
parolee's
behavior.
and
this
court
expressly
in
morrissey
rejected
the
concern
that
this
procedure
that
it
was
mandating
would
impair
or
affect
the
exercise
of
discretion.
it
said,
a
simple
factual
hearing
will
not
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
discretion.
yet
that
is
exactly
what
the
eighth
circuit
is
doing
in
this
case,
and
that
is
exactly
what
respondent
demands.
there
is
not
the
slightest
contention
in
this
case
that
the
facts
of
this
matter
were
not
adequately
developed,
that
the
state
circuit
court
was
not
fully
aware
of
all
pertinent
facts
both
pertaining
to
the
person's
guilt
of
the
revocation
and
to
enable
him
to
make
a
decision
as
to
what
disposition
should
be
made.
rather,
what
they
are
asking,
and
what
the
eighth
circuit
is
saying
can
be
done
and
should
be
done
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
is
that
for
the
federal
habeas
court
to
look
into
the
mind,
based
purely
upon
the
record,
of
the
state
revoking
judge
or
revoking
authority
and
say
that
that
court
or
authority
did
not
use
the
right
mental
process
in
arriving
at
its
conclusion.
and
i
submit
respectfully
that
that
is
completely
beyond
the
contemplation
and
beyond
the
policy
that
was
stated
by
this
court
in
morrissey
and
gagnon.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
that
is
how
i
understand
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
district
court's
requirement
to
be,
that
the
court
is
required
to
make
some
sort
of
record
statement
by
which
it
can
be
determined
what
it
was
thinking
about
when
it
made
the
decision
on
sentencing.
it
must
say,
i
consider
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e
as
alternatives
to
incarceration,
and
i
don't
think
they
are
adequate
because
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e.
and
again,
that
is...
goes
beyond
the
factual
concerns
that
this
court
had
in
morrissey,
and
it
goes
to
the
question
of
the
exercise
of
the
court's
discretion.
now,
the
respondent
has
very
heavily
relied
upon
one
passage
in
this
court's
decision
in
morrissey,
and
it
was
in
the
early
part
of
the
decision,
in
part
1
of
the
decision,
in
which
this
court
said,
as
i
just
mentioned
before,
that
there
are
two
states,
the
stage
of
determination
of
guilt
of
the
violation
and
the
decision
on
sentencing.
he
has
not
only
cited
this
over
and
over
again,
but
he
cited
lower
court
state
and
federal
cases
that
simply
quoted
the
language,
as
if
the
language
supports
his
conclusion.
the
difficulty,
the
petitioners
submit,
is
that
this
language
was
a
purely
factual
statement
in
this
court's
opinion.
it
contained
no
constitutional
holding
or
principle.
it
is
a
correct
factual
statement.
exactly
the
same
thing
could
be
said
that
this
court
said
in
morrissey
about
a
criminal
trial.
one
could
say
that
there
are
two
stages
in
a
criminal
trial,
a
determination
of
whether
the
person
is
guilty
of
the
offense
charged,
and
if
he
is
guilty
whether
he
should
be
sent
to
prison
or
put
on
probation
or
whatever
the
alternatives
may
be.
yet
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
in
cases
too
numerous...
i
can
cite
several,
but
this
courth
has
well
established
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
one
cannot
review
the
sentencing
discretion
of
the
state
court
unless
the
sentence
itself
is
inherently
unconstitutional,
or
there
is
some
other
due
process
defect.
this
court
has,
in
roberts
versus
united
states,
united
states
versus
grayson,
and
other
cases,
has
acknowledged
that
that
area
is
not
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
your
honor,
i
submit
not,
because
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
and
should
be
no
constitutional
requirement
that
a
judge
consider
alternatives
to
incarceration.
that
is
at
a
stage
just
like,
qualitatively
like
a
decision
on--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--well,
i
admit
that
is
a
rather
close
question,
because
this
court
has
acknowledged
that,
for
example,
in
the
sentencing
context
a
sentence
can
be
invalid
because
the
court
employs
an
improper
information
or
improper
factual
background
for
its
sentencing.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
absolutely,
your
honor,
i
agree
it
cannot,
but
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
specified
in
morrissey
and
gagnon,
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
has
been
providing.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
your
honor,
there
are
remedies.
there
are
remedies
i
have
cited
in
my
reply
brief.
one
can
challenge
both
sentence
and
other
matters
in
missouri
courts.
there
is
also--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--your
hypothetical.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
i
mean,
there
is
no
evidence
of
this
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
unless...
oh,
no,
not
as
far
as
the
fact
that
the
judge
had
not...
you
know,
had...
was
of
the
mistaken
impression
that
he
was
bound
by
law,
no.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
that
is
exactly
what
they
did.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
respondent
had
two
attorneys
at
the
hearing.
evidence
was
introduced,
and
there
was
after
the
evidence
full
argument
by
both
sides.
the
other
language
in
morrissey
that
has
been
relied
upon
besides
the
two
step
language,
which
again,
we
submit,
is
not
constitutional
in
its
character,
is
the
admittedly
constitutional
requirement
that
the
revoking
authority
state
the
evidence
it
relied
upon
and
the
reasons
for
revoking
probation.
the
respondent
has
sought
to
draw
this
into
what
he
believes
to
be
the
constitutional
right
to
consideration
of
alternatives
to
incarceration,
yet
that
requirement
is
easily
understandable
as
permitting
and
facilitating
an
appellate
review
of
the
decision
to
revoke
probation.
for
example,
in
this
court's
decision
in
douglas
versus
bruder,
this
court
held
that
due
process
was
violated
because
the
person
who
was
revoked,
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
a
finding
that
he
had
committed
a
probation
violation.
particularly
where
you
have
multiple
charges
of
probation
violation,
obviously
a
finding
is
essential
to
allow
a
court
to
make
that
sort
of
decision.
similarly
in
bearden
versus
georgia,
there
had
to
be
something
on
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
probationer
was
revoked
because
he
could
not
pay
his
restitution.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
no,
sir,
he--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--nothing
regarding
the
appropriateness
of
a
sentencing
decision
was
said.
their
only
theory
at
the
revocation
proceeding
was
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
leaving
the
scene
of
an
accident,
and
that
was
their
evidence,
and
that
was
their
argument.
there
was
nothing
else.
in
the
present
case,
as
far
as
the
finding,
a
finding
requirement
is
concerned,
there
was
only
one
issue
at
this
revocation
hearing,
and
that
was,
again,
whether
or
not
he
was
guilty
of
leaving
the
scene
of
an
accident.
the
court
indubitably
found
and
expressly
and
extensively
found
that
he
was
indeed
guilty
of
leaving
the
scene,
and
the
court
said
based
upon
the
evidence
that
he
discussed
and
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
he
discussed,
the
court
said
based
upon
this
evidence,
this
probation
is
revoked.
the
court
has
by
its
finding,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
in
the
last
few
pages,
the
court
has
by
its
finding
stated
the
evidence
upon
which
it
relied
and
the
reason
for
revoking
probation,
and
that
is
all
that
this
court
has
ever
asked
of
a
revoking
authority,
be
it
a
court
or
a
parole
board.
had
respondent
originally
been
sentenced
to
imprisonment,
there
is
no
dispute
that
there
would
be
no
requirement,
and
respondent
has
not
attempted
to
dispute
that
there
would
be
no
requirement
that
alternative
incarceration
be
specified
by
the
sentencing
court.
although
we
acknowledge
that
there
may
be
some
difference
in
terms
of
liberty
interest,
although
frankly
i
find
it
very
hard
to
analyze
what
liberty
interest
or
what
due
process
principles
apply
to
sentencing,
because
this
court
really
hasn't
directly
addressed
it,
we
submit
that
the
two
decisions
are
qualitatively
the
same,
and
in
fact
in
many
cases,
principally
involving
a
suspended
imposition
of
sentence,
they
are
identical.
they
are
one
and
the
same.
in
a
suspended
imposition
of
sentence,
of
course,
a
person
is
convicted
or
pleads
guilty,
and
no
sentencing
decision
is
made,
and
he
is
placed
on
probation.
the
decision
is
simply
deferred
until
such
time,
if
ever,
that
his
probation
is
revoked.
i
submit
that
it
is
not
reasonable
or
it
is
not
an
offense
against
fundamental
fairness
to
hold
that
these
two
are
essentially
the
same,
and
the
discretion
that
exists
as
to
one
should
and
does
as
a
matter
of
due
process
exist
as
to
the
other.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
the
latter,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
there
is
or
there
should
be,
there
has
never
been
in
the
past,
at
least,
any
requirement
that
alternatives
to
incarceration
is
a
constitutional
question.
the
purpose
of
the
statement
of
the
revoking
authority
is
to
show
that
it
has...
the
facts
upon
which
it
relies
to
permit
appellate
review
of
its
decision
on
that
subject,
and
that
is
pretty
much
the
extent
of
the
statement.
there
is
no
requirement
according
to
the
state's
position
that
there
be
alternatives
to
incarceration
considered
because
this
is
a
matter
no
longer
of
fact,
which
morrissey
and
gagnon
cover,
but
of
discretion.
it
should
be
clear,
i
think,
why
the
state
of
missouri
and
the
19
other
amici
curiae
states
oppose
this
holding
of
the
lower
court.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
engraved
invitation
to
a
whole
new
front
of
federal
habeas
corpus
litigation
involving
probation
and
parole
revocations.
i
know
the
inmate
writ
writers,
some
of
them
i
am
acquainted
with
would
just
be
absolutely
ecstatic
at
the
notion
of
saying
in
every
case
in
which
one
has
a
probation
or
parole
revocation,
trying
to
come
up
with
new
and
creative
alternatives
that
the
revoking
court
did
not
consider.
on
top
of
that,
we
submit,
and
the
respondent
has
cited
no
cases,
and
we
are
not
aware
of
any,
in
which
this
alternative,
this
requirement
of
consideration
of
alternatives
to
incarceration
exists.
he
cited
a
number
of
state
cases.
most
of
these
cases...
and
federal
cases,
and
most
of
these
cases
simply
cite
the
two-step
language,
which
does
not
get
him
anywhere.
there
are
a
couple
of
cases
that
address
the
question
of
whether
one
can
prevent
the
introduction
of
evidence
in
mitigation
at
as
revocation
hearing,
and
that
is
not
in
issue
here.
in
fact,
that
was
pretty
well
covered
in
morrissey.
with
one
possible
exception
in,
i
believe,
hawaii,
this
is
an
entirely
novel
principle
that
respondent
is
urging.
and
for
reasons
i
have
already
discussed,
we
think
it
is
completely
out
of
line
with
what
this
court
has
previously
demanded
in
terms
of
due
process
of
probation
and
parole
revocation.
there
is
one
final
reason
why
this
holding
should
be
opposed,
and
i
think
if
respondent
didn't
benefit
from
this,
the
lower
court's
decision,
i
would
think
it
would
oppose
it
on
the
same
grounds.
the
fact
is,
and
as
we
have
stated
it
is
absolutely
undisputed
that
there
is,
according
to
respondents'
position
and
according
to
the
decisions
of
the
court
below,
they
seek
to
create
a
disparity,
a
difference
in
burden
between
a
sentencing
decision
after
the
original
pleading
of
plea
or
finding
of
guilt
and
a
sentencing
decision
after
a
revocation
of
probation.
in
fact,
in
doing
so,
they
have
created
an
additional
risk,
an
additional
concern
for
a
state
sentencing
court
in
deciding
to
put
someone
on
probation.
if
he
puts
the
person
on
probation,
there
is
a
possibility
that
a
number
of
years
down
the
line
that
habeas
corpus
can
be
filed,
and
a
number
of
years
down
the
line
the
person
can
be...
if
the
right
words
are
not
said
at
the
time
of
the
revocation,
that
he
can
be,
in
this
case,
discharged
completely,
whereas
if
a
person
sentences
this
individual
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
initially,
that
is
undisputably
by
the
holdings
of
this
court
not
a
subject
of
review
unless
there
is
an
inherent
constitutional--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--your
honor...
well,
i
will
tell
you
what.
the
thing
about...
when
you
are
asking
about
the
law
in
missouri,
all
i
can
supply
is
anecdotal
information,
and
i
am
not
sure
how
appropriate
or
useful
that
is.
i
just
can
say
i
am
aware
of
cases
where
the
sentence
executed
was
not
imposed.
you
know,
what
else
can
i
say,
because
it...
i
don't
think
that
is
the
case.
i
don't
think
courts
are
under
the
assumption
that
they
can
do
nothing,
that
they
are
powerless
to
do
nothing
aside
from
what
they
have
originally
ordered.
it
is
still
their
decision.
it
is
still
their
order.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
parole,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
here
is
the
sequence,
your
honor.
he
was,
of
course,
placed
on
probation.
he
was
revoked.
he
was
sent
to
prison
based
upon
the
revocation
of
probation.
in
about
1983
he
was
paroled,
so
therefore
his
current
custody
status
if
this
case
as
we
hold
it
to
be,
that
the
lower
court
decision
is
invalid
and
the
decision
of
the...
the
revocation
proceeding
was
proper,
the
proper
remedy
is
to
restore
him
to
parole,
which
is
where
he
was
when
this
case
was
decided.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
that,
your
honor,
is
when
his
revocation
was...
when
his
probation
was
revoked.
he
was
sent
back
to
prison,
and
he
did
his
time,
and
he
was
put
on
parole.
am
i
not
answering
your
question?
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
the
revocation
is
still
in
existence.
he
was
in
custody
under
the
revocation.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
inasmuch
as
petitioners
have
released
him
on
parole,
and
as
of
the
time
that
his
habeas
corpus
petition
was
granted
he
was
on
parole,
all
we
are
asking
is
that
he
be
restored
to
parole.
there
is
no
legal
question
or
contention
here
that--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
matter
of
disregarding
that
order.
it
was
carried
out,
and
he
was
put
in
prison.
of
course,
the
order
of
judge
whipple
says
he
was--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--your
honor,
as
i
see
it,
this
is--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--unless
sooner
discharged,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
excuse
me?
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
your
honor,
it
is
no
different
than
if
he
were
originally
sentenced
to
20
years,
he
had
done
five
or
whatever
he
did
and
was
released
on
parole.
we
are
not
asking
that
he
be
sent
back
to
prison.
we
are
just
asking
that
he
be
restored
to
the
custody
level
at
which
he
was
at
the
time
of
the...
that
the
missouri
law
provides
for
and
which
he
was
on
at
the
time.
but
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
this
does
create
a
greater
risk,
a
greater
concern
for
a
court
in
deciding
to
put
someone
on
parole,
and
i
just
would...
i
am
amazed
to
hear
this
point
advocated,
because
it
would
seem
to
me
in
close
cases,
and
i
submit
this
was
a
close
case
involving
a
decision
on
prison
versus
incarceration,
this
individual
amazingly,
even
the
presentence
investigation
recommended
that
he
be
incarcerated,
that
he
not
be
placed
on
probation.
he
had
committed
a
rather
serious,
rather
large-scale
drug
offense,
and
his
record,
as
the
judge
said,
was
not
very
good.
i
can't
believe
that
there
wouldn't
be
or
couldn't
be
in
some
cases,
that
this
would,
this
disparity
of
consequences,
this
risk
is
not
going
to
weigh
upon
judges'
minds,
and
that
is
no
more
in
the
interest
of
the
state
of
missouri
than
it
is
in
the
interest
of
persons
who
are
candidates
for
probation
and
parole,
because
missouri,
like
every
other
state,
has
its
concern
with
prison
population.
so,
we
submit
for
all
these
reasons
and
under
this
court's
decisions
in
morrissey
and
gagnon,
this
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
just
one
point,
your
honor.
there
has
been
some
persistent
questioning
about
what
it
is
that
respondent
in
the
lower
court
expects
in
the
way
of
findings.
just
in
addition
to
what
has
been
said
and
the
questions
that
have
been
asked,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
district
court's
opinion,
and
it
says...
and
oddly
the
court
says
if
this
issue
is
raised
there
needn't
be
a
finding.
but
if
it
isn't
raised,
the
court
says,
the
trial
court
must
express
a
rudimentary
explanation
for
the
rejection
of
alternatives.
a
record
devoid
of
anything
but
a
mere
recital
that
alternatives
have
been
considered
and
denied
does
not
comport
with
justice.
so,
i
do
dispute
respondent's
assertion
that
all
one
has
to...
this
seems
to
be
an
open-ended
requirement.
not
only
you
cannot
say,
well,
i
considered
alternatives,
but
you
have
got
to
say,
by
my
inference,
at
least,
that
you
considered
a
certain
number
of
alternatives
and
presumably
if
someone
comes
up
with
some
new
ones
later,
like
apologizing
in
the
town
square,
that
is
going
to
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
