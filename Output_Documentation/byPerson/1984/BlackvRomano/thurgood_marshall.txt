go
back
on
probation.
justice

what
are
you
going
to

therefore
revoke
it.
that
wouldn't
be
enough?

says,
you
were
up
for
consideration
of
revocation
of
your
parole,
you
have
been
convicted

felony
while
on
parole,
therefore
your
parole
is
revoked.
justice
marshall
very
well.
you
were
paroled,
and
you
are
up
for
revocation
of
parole,
and
you
have

killing
your
mother,
we
revoke
your
parole.
justice
marshall
wouldn't
you
be
better
off
if
you
argued
this
case
instead
of

others?
justice
marshall
well,
you
have
invited
it.
justice
marshall
and
you
don't
know
how
much
is
needed.
you

upon
the
appearance
and
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
and
the
interests
of
the
witness
in
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
and
found
the
victim's
mother,
father,
and
sister
to
be
truthful
and
straightforward
in
their
answers.
the
court
further
finds
that
while
"#

else
do
you
want
him
to
say?
"
justice
marshall
and
if
he
just
says
that,
that's
it?
justice
marshall
that's
enough?
justice
marshall
but
he
did
all
he
could
to
say
that
it
wasn't
arbitrary.
he
said,
i
gave
careful
consideration.
justice
marshall
well,
he
didn't
say
that.
don't
charge
the
judge
with
something
that
he
didn't
say.
justice
marshall
the
judge
did
not
use
the
words
you
wanted
him
to
use.

is
your
complaint.

a
motion
for
that?
justice
marshall

a
motion
to
that
effect
before
judge

justice
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the

it
to
judge
whipple?
justice
marshall
