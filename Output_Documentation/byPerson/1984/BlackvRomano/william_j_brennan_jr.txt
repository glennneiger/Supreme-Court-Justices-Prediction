justice
jr.
how
long
did
he
serve
before
that?
justice
jr.
has
there
been
any
practice
in
missouri
of
violation
of
a
condition
of
probation
automatically
to
reimpose
the
prison
sentence?
justice
jr.
when
a
revocation
of
probation
is
sought
and
the
only
thing
that
is
established
is
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
condition
of
probation,
automatically
is
there
any
practice
of
reimposing
the
sentence?
justice
jr.
it
is?
justice
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
i
gather...
doesn't,
if
one
is
given
probation,
i
gather
he
has
a
liberty
interest
in
the
probation
term,
doesn't
he?
justice
jr.
can
that
be
taken
away
from
him
without
some
kind
of
process?
justice
jr.
tell
me,
at
the
revocation
hearing,
did
the
respondent's
attorneys
argue,
your
honor,
you
can't
consider
reimposing
sentence
except
as
a
last
resort,
you
have
to
consider
a
lot
of
other
possible
alternatives
and
tell
us
why
you
don't
adopt
one
of
them?
justice
jr.
that
argument
was
not
made?
justice
jr.
well,
what
do
you
say,
mr.
cherrick,
the
trial
judge
should
have
put
on
the
record
here
before
he
pronounced,
i
revoke?
justice
jr.
exactly
what
do
you
think
he
should
have
said?
justice
jr.
if
he
had
said
that
much--
justice
jr.
--you
wouldn't
be
here
now.
justice
jr.
even
if
he
had
thought
all
of
those
things
without
expressing
them,
you
would
not
be
satisfied.
you
would
want
him
to
state
that
on
the
record.
