justice
rehnquist
well,
in
the
view
of
the
eighth
circuit,
mr.
morris,
was
there
some
way
that
a
trial
court
could
have
satisfied
this
requirement,
like
making
findings
of
record
or
something
like
that?
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
as
a
practical
matter
if
a
defendant
was
sentenced
in
what
he
regarded
or
had
probation
revoked
in
violation
of
missouri
law,
the
practical
thing
to
do
would
be
to
appeal
to
the
missouri
appellate
courts.
they
are
the
ones
to
determine
a
state
law
violation.
justice
rehnquist
if
your
probation
is
revoked,
i
will
have
no
choice
but
to
simply
reimpose
the
sentence,
and
you
will
have
to
start
serving
it.
that
is
what
state
law
provided.
if
probation
is
revoked,
there
is
no
other
alternative.
now,
do
you
think
morrissey
against
brewer
as
you
interpret
it
would
require
the
state
judge
in
that
case
on
a
probation
revocation
hearing
to
consider
alternatives
to
imprisonment.
justice
rehnquist
then
you
say
that
one
of
the
holdings
of
morrissey
and
gagnon
is
that
a
state
may
not
provide
by
statute
for
a
granting
of
probation,
suspending
imposition
of
sentence,
granting
of
probation
on
the
condition
that
if
probation
is
revoked
for
violation
of
a
condition,
that
you
automatically
go
to
jail.
i
think
your
interpretation
would
come
as
a
surprise
to
a
lot
of
people.
justice
rehnquist
and
the
proper
criteria
in
your
view,
i
guess,
are
mandated
by
the
federal
constitution.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
criteria,
too.
in
other
words,
a
state
court
judge
may
never
say
that
i
find
that
you
have
violated
your
probation,
and
therefore
under
the
policy
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
or
a
statute
of
the
state
of
missouri,
i
am
sending
you
to
jail
because
we
say
once
your
probation
is
violated
you
don't
get
another
chance.
that
is
prohibited
by
the
federal
constitution.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that
liberty
interest
was
always
freighted
with
the
conditions
of
parole.
certainly
that
liberty
interest
was
burdened
with
the
conditions
of
parole
from
the
very
beginning,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
you
are
not
making
any
factual
dispute
that
he
did
commit
this
particular
offense.
there
is
no
disagreement
there,
is
there?
justice
rehnquist
well,
didn't
he
plead
guilty?
justice
rehnquist
and
that
in
your
view
is
a
federal
question
in
every
case?
justice
rehnquist
can
you
answer
my
question?
is
it
a
federal
question
in
every
case?
justice
rehnquist
no,
whether
it
is
a
substantial...
i
use
your
language,
i
believe,
a
substantial
probation
violation.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
a
federal
question
in
every
case?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
