mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--yes,
it
is
clear,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
he
is
on
parole.
however,
that
parole
term
extends
until
the
year
2002,
which
is
a
very
serious
and
difficult,
grievous
loss
to
his
liberty.
we
are
asking
in
terms
of
the
remedy
that
this
court
affirm
the
lower
court's
decision
and
release
him
from
all
custody
because
he
in
effect
has
served
out
his
probation
term
in
jail,
and
that
is
the
remedy
under
missouri
law,
as
the
district
court
found.
when
the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
granted
romano
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
we
submit
they
remedied
a
very
gross
injustice
in
this
case.
jim
romano
spent
five
and
a
half
years
incarcerated
as
a
result
of
an
unconstitutional
probation
revocation
hearing
which
occurred
almost
eight
years
ago
in
lebanon,
missouri.
this
court
should
require
and
should
hold
that
the
due
process
clause,
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
trial
judges
should
state
on
the
record
whether
alternatives
should
be
considered
before
revoking
probation,
and
we
submit
that
this
court
should
make
this
holding
and
follow
this
holding
for
three
principal
reasons.
first,
it
is
the
precedent
of
this
court,
a
12-year
precedent
in
the
landmark
decisions
of
morrissey
versus
brewer
and
gagnon
versus
scarpelli.
in
those
cases
this
court
stated
that
alternatives
to
incarceration
should
be
considered
before
a
trial
judge
revokes
probation.
we
have
cited
numerous
federal
and
state
cases
which
have
applied
that
rule,
have
it
applied
it
consistently
and
uniformly.
there
is
no
conflict
among
the
state
and
the
federal
courts
as
to
this
issue.
mr.
cherrick,
do
you
think
then
that
morrissey
and
gagnon
included
a
substantive
requirement
like
that
along
with
their
procedural
requirements?
justice
rehnquist,
we
believe
that
was
part
of
the
procedural
requirement
of
gagnon.
indeed,
all
the
numerous
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
follow
that
rule.
there
is
a
two-step
rule
requirement
in
a
revocation
hearing.
first
is
the
issue
of
whether
a
probation
violation
existed,
and
second,
if
a
violation
is
found,
and
this,
of
course,
is
the
critical
issue
in
this
case,
should
the
probationer
be
recommitted
to
prison
or
should
other
steps
be
taken
to
protect
society--
supposing
that
the
state
law
provides
and
the
sentencing
judge
sentenced
under
a
statute
that
says
i
am
giving
you
parole,
but
if
your
parole
is
revoked,
your
probation
is
revoked...
was
it
probation
or
parole?
probation
in
this
case.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
if
the
statute
as
you
have
hypothesized
it
stated
that,
we
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
under
morrissey
and
gagnon.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
your
honor,
we
submit
that
all
state
and
federal
courts
that
have
interpreted
this
issue
have
held
that,
and
as
justice
o'connor
wrote
in
the
bearden...
excuse
me...
yes,
in
the
bearden
decision,
that
sentencing
courts
daily
throughout
this
land
consider
alternatives
to
incarceration.
they
do
that,
we
submit,
because
they
are
following
gagnon
and
morrissey.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes,
justice
o'connor.
however,
the
court
noted
in
bearden
that
fault
was
not
the
standard
by
which
the
alternatives
to
incarceration
requirement
should
be
considered.
indeed,
we
believe
that
bearden
stands
for
the
proposition
that
this
issue
must
be
decided,
as
the
eighth
circuit
said,
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
there
can
be
no
bright
line
drawn
as
to
when
alternatives
to
incarceration
must
be
considered.
there
are
an
infinite
amount
of
factual
possibilities
as
to
what
the
underlying
crime
is
and
what
the
probation
revocation
is.
that
indeed
is
why
bearden
was
decided
on
its
facts.
the
court
was
able
to
look
at
those
particular
facts
and
state
under
those
particular
facts
that
an
indigent
who
fails
to
make
restitution,
it
would
be
fundamentally
unfair
to
revoke
probation
without
considering
alternatives
under
those
facts.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
justice
o'connor,
the
fact
that
a
probationer
commits
a
crime
is
not
the
issue
in
a
probation
revocation
proceeding.
as
to
the
crime,
the
probationer
is
punished
later
by
the
state.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
state
decided
that
this
crime
which
romano
committed
involving
this
traffic
accident
was
careless
and
reckless
driving,
and
they
punished
him
under
the
state's
purposes.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
well,
the
court--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--it
is
fundamentally
unfair
if,
for
example,
the
probation
violation
is
a
technical
offense.
for
example,
if
a
probationer
does
not
report,
let
us
say,
one
friday
afternoon
to
his
probation
officer,
and
the
court
states,
yes,
we
think
the
law
is
that
for
any
probation
violation
probation
must
be
revoked,
no
matter
whether
it
is
significant
and
whether
it
has
any
relationship
to
the
underlying
offense,
whether
it
reflects
that
the
probationer
can
no
longer
be
supervised
or
rehabilitated
in
the
community.
indeed,
this
is
the
situation
here.
petitioners
have
conceded
that
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
judge
whipple
in
this
case
considered
alternatives
to
incarceration
at
the
revocation
hearing,
but
the
record
does
say
something
very
interesting,
and
that
is
at
the
sentencing
hearing
judge
whipple
told
jim
romano
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
he
was
prepared
to
revoke
the
probation
for
any
violation.
we
suggest
that
while
that
possibly
may
have
been
hyperbole
on
the
judge's
part,
if
indeed
judge
whipple
thought
that
was
the
law,
it
violated
morrissey
and
gagnon
and
deprived
romano
of
his
due
process
rights,
because
on
the
face
of
it
his
conduct
involved
in
the
probation
violation
had
no
rational
relationship
to
the
underlying
crime.
it
did
not
compel
the
conclusion
that
his
probation
had
failed.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
no,
your
honor,
that
language
was
from
the
eighth
circuit
opinion,
but
our
basic
point
is
that
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
trial
judge
look
at
the
facts
or
the
probation
violation
and
see
whether
it
indicated
that
the
probationer
could
no
longer
be
rehabilitated
or
supervised
in
the
community.
we
are
not...
this
is
a
very
limited,
limited
issue.
we
are
not
stating
that
due
process
mandates
a
result
in
a
specific
case.
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
due
process
requires
that
the
court
make
a
finding
or
a
statement
of
reasons
which
an
appellate
court
can
review
to
determine
that
this
court
focused
on
the
proper
criteria,
that
it
made
a
rational
decision,
a
non-arbitrary
decision.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
the
process
is
mandated
by
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
because,
justice
rehnquist,
under
morrissey
and
gagnon,
the
probationer
has
a
significant
liberty
interest.
when
judge
whipple
restored
that
liberty
to
romano
at
the
sentencing
hearing
and
said,
this
court
as
a
matter
of
law
does
not
think
that
you
need
to
be
incarcerated,
that
you
can
be
rehabilitated
or
supervised
in
the
community,
that
liberty
interest
which
is
so
strong
cannot
be
taken
away
upon
arbitrary
reasons.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
that
is
true,
and
the
only...
and
the
condition
of
parole
or
probation
in
this
case
that
was
relevant
was
the
general
condition
in
which
romano
stated,
i
will
obey
all
the
laws
of
the
state
of
missouri.
if
this
court
does
not
hold
that
reasons
or
alternative
be
considered,
this
court
in
effect
will
be
saying
that
if
a
person
runs
a
stop
sign
or
gets
a
speeding
ticket,
and
a
judge
decides
that
he
should
automatically
revoke
probation,
that
that
is
fundamentally
fair.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
mr.
chief
justice,
no,
because
under
the
facts
which
you
state,
that
is
the
classic
sentencing
situation
of
which
a
person
is
not
entitled
to
significant
due
process
rights.
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
has
been
constitutionally
deprived
of
his
due
process
rights,
and
therefore
we
accept
the
traditional
rule,
and
we
are
not
asking,
as
the
state
suggests,
to
extend
this
rule
that
sentencing
judges
state
reasons
on
the
record
or
state
alternatives.
but
when
judge
whipple--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--pardon
me?
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
but
when
judge
whipple
then
restored
romano's
liberty
by
saying,
we,
the
state
believes
you
can
be
rehabilitated
in
the
community,
that
significant
liberty
interest
which,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
explained
and
developed
in
the
morrissey
case,
that
significant
liberty
interest
cannot
be
taken
away
without
some
fundamental
due
process
which
protects
against
arbitrary
decisions.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
justice
white--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--we
do
not
think
that
there
can
be
any
specific
formulistic
standard
as
to--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--not
necessarily.
as
long
as
the--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
under
the
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--we
believe
that
reasons
and--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--yes,
and
we
believe
that
reasons
and
alternatives
are
nearly
synonymous,
because
probation
is
by
definition
an
alternative
to
incarceration.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
it
would
if
the
appellate
court
based
on
the
record
thought
that
the
judge
had
considered
the
proper
criteria,
understood
the
purposes
of
probation
in
his
decision--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--justice
white,
we
believe
that
there
must
be
a
record.
as
justice
cardoza
wrote
over
50
years
ago,
we
must
know
what
a
decision
means
before
the
duty
becomes
ours
to
say
whether
it
is
right
or
wrong.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
that
is
true,
but
the
words
of
justice
cardoza,
i
believe,
still
have
the
same
force
and
the
same
relevance
to
this
case,
because
in
the--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--excuse
me.
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
justice
marshall,
the
fact
that
a
person
commits
a
felony
is
not
necessarily
dispositive.
what
is
important,
we
believe,
is
the
conduct,
not
the
fact
that
it
was
a
crime,
because
probation
revocation...
in
the
probation
revocation--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--under
those
facts,
we
think
that
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
parolee
could
not
be
supervised
in
the
community,
that
he
indeed
would
be
a
dangerous
individual,
but
that
could
easily
be
resolved
by
a
harmless
error
test
on
review...
on
appeal,
and
in
fact--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--that
is
true,
but--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--we
do
not
think
that
there
can
be
any
line
drawn
as
to
when
under
any
specific
facts
alternatives
should
be
considered.
we
think
that
the
rule--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--we
think...
we
are
confident
as
has
occurred
in
the
last
12
years
that
courts
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
which
is
exactly
what
has
happened,
have
looked
at
the
facts
of
each
case
and
determined
whether
there
was
prejudicial
error,
whether
there
was...
whether
the
probation
violation
reflected
that
the
probationer
could
no
longer
be
supervised
or
rehabilitated
in
the
community.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes,
your
honor,
we--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--in
gagnon
the
court
stated
that
the
second
step
of
a
prohibition
revocation
hearing
is
that
the
judge
should
determine
whether
the
probationer
should
be
recommitted
to
prison
or
should
other
steps
be
taken
to
protect
society
and
improve
chances
of
rehabilitation.
later
in
the
gagnon
decision
the
court
stated
as
part
of
the
due
process
requirements
that
a
court
must
state
its
evidence
relied
on
and
reasons
for
revoking
probation.
there
were
no
reasons
that
were
articulated
by
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
on
the
record.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
but
we--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--at
the
revocation--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--we
are
saying
that
it
was
simply...
we
don't
know
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case.
the
record
is
silent.
and
the
great
possibility
exists--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--we
are
willing
to
defer
to
the
state
finding
that
he
committed
the
offense
in
question.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
no,
he
pled
not
guilty
subsequently
to
the
offense
and
was
convicted
of
careless
driving.
you
are
not
fighting
about
the
careless
driving
conviction,
are
you?
no,
but
the
fact
that
it
was
a
careless
driving
conviction
reflects
the
fact
that
this
was
not
a
substantial
probation
violation.
it
was
not
a
significant
violation,
and
therefore--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--what
is
a
federal
question--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--the
process?
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes,
that
the
judge
should
focus
on
that
criteria--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--a
constitutional
question?
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes.
the
basis
for
the
rule
in
gagnon
is
the
court
balanced
the
various
interests.
the
court
in
a
due
process
balancing
context
looks
at
the
individual's
interest,
the
state's
interest,
and
society's
interest,
and
we
submit
that
all
of
these
interests
are
identical
in
that
they...
that
all
these
interests
feel
that...
have
an
interest
in
probations
not
being
revoked
for
arbitrary
reasons.
if
this
court...
this
court
in
gagnon
and
morrissey
talked
about
the
informed
use
of
discretion.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
in
this
case--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--i
think
he
should
have
said
romano
was
driving
this
car,
he
hit
his
friend
and
drove
away.
despite
the
fact
that
he
let
people
out
to
take
care
of
this
friend,
and
was
in
the
hospital
room,
nevertheless
we
feel
that
he
can
no
longer
be
rehabilitated
in
the
community,
that
he
is
a
danger
to
the
community,
that
probation
has
failed.
if
we
knew
that,
then
i
think--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--that
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
that's
true,
but
the
fact
is
that
we
don't
know
what
he
said,
and
moreover,
we
have
some
indication
that
he
was
prepared
to
revoke
probation
for
any
violation.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes,
because
if
there
is
no
record,
there
can
be
no
appellate
review.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
if
there
is
a
significant
liberty
interest
involved,
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
protection.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
well,
there
is
so
much
discretion
that
is
given
to
the
judge
in
a
probation
revocation
hearing.
the
court
has
stated
that
all
types
of
evidence
can
come
in.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
discretion
in
terms
of
the
evidentiary
proceedings.
there
is
not
the
criminal
standard
of
review.
the
burden
of
proof
is
much
less
significant.
therefore
there
must
be
some
protection
of
the
decisionmaking
process
to
know
that
the
judge
focused
on
the
proper
criteria.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
no,
because
while
that
may
have
the
force
of
a
threat
or
a
deterrent
effect,
nevertheless
if
that
were
the
rule
in
each
case,
then
courts
would
be
prepared
to
revoke
probation
for
any
violation,
and
that
is
against
the
fundamental
policies
of
probation,
which
is
to
rehabilitate
and
supervise
people
in
the
community.
and
once
the
decision
was
made
to
put
someone
on
probation,
that
liberty
interest
involves
and
constitutes
that
decision
that
this
person
can't
be--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--at
sentencing?
i
don't
think
there
is
any
constitutional
requirement
as
to
what
he
must
tell
the
individual.
it
is
only
once
the
judge
has
put
the
individual
on
probation
that
the
liberty
interest
attaches.
we
also
stress--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--justice
o'connor,
as
to
the
remedial
question,
first,
it
is
supported
under
missouri
law,
and
under
missouri
law
once
a
probation
term
has
expired,
the
court
must
release
the
probationer
from
all
custody.
as
that
original
probation
hearing
was
unconstitutional,
romano
spent
the
maximum
term
of
probation
is
five
years
in
jail.
the
trial
judge
in
this
case,
district
judge
cahill,
an
experienced
judge...
sat
on
the
state
bench
for
five
years,
and
in
the
same
position
as
judge
whipple,
sat
as
a
state
judge
in
st.
louis...
was
well
familiar
with
this
law
and
ruled
that
the
probation
term
had
expired.
so,
first,
we
think
it
is
a
question
of
state
law
which
this
court
traditionally
defers
to
lower
courts
to
interpret
state
law.
we
would
agree
that...
we
feel
that
this
is
the
rare
case.
certainly
in
the
typical
case
the
simple
remedy
is
to
remand
for
a
new
hearing
which
would
comply
with
due
process,
and
we
do
not
dispute
this.
the
remedy
in
this
case
is
unique
because
of
the
time
that
has
elapsed,
the
five
and
a
half
years
in
jail,
the
eight
years
between
the
probation
violation
and
the
revocation
hearing.
so
this
is
really
a
unique
case.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes,
but
all
those
findings
are
as
to
the
evidence.
there
is
no
discussion
of
the
reasons.
he
certainly
made
a
lot
of
findings
as
to
what
the
evidence
was
of
the
probation
violation.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
i
want
judge
whipple
to
say
that,
yes,
there
has
been
evidence
of
a
violation,
and
now
we
must
consider
whether
this
probationer
can
no
longer
be
maintained
on
probation,
can
he
no
longer
be
supervised
in
the
community,
is
he
too
dangerous
to
be--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--that's
correct.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
that's
enough,
because
then
we
know
his
decision
is
not
arbitrary,
because
then--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--we
believe
and
we
think
there
is
a
strong
possibility
that
this
judge
thought
that
all
he
needed
to
do
was
find
a
probation
violation,
that
he
need
not
discuss
the
second--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
he...
the
record
is
silent.
we
don't
know.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes,
but
those
words
are
important,
because
they
reflect
whether
the
judge
focused
on
the
proper
criteria,
and
a
decision...
if
decisions...
we
need
a
record
to
be
certain
that
arbitrary
decisions
are
not
made.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
what
was
not
allowed
in
terms
of
what?
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
right,
there
was
no--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--no
evidence
was
offered,
but
this
is...
we
are--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--because
we
believe
it
is
the
duty
of
the
sentencing
judge.
this
is
part
of
the
decisionmaking
process.
under
morrissey
and
gagnon
the
requirement
to--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--pardon?
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
no,
but--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--it
wasn't
mentioned
because
the
alternatives
were
in
this
case
fairly
obvious.
there
really
would
not
have
been
a
point
to
tell
judge
whipple
that
he
could
have
given
alternatives
to
incarceration.
the
mitigating
evidence
was
presented
to
judge
whipple.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
we
at
least
want
to
know
that
the
judge
focused
on
this
criteria.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
no,
we
didn't
tell
him
that,
but
that
was
the
law
under
morrissey
and--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--where
is--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--no,
we
did
not
inform
him
about
what
morrissey
said.
