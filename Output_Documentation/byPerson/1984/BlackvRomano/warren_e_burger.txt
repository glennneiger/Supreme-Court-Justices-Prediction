we
will
have
arguments
now
in
black
against
romano.
mr.
morris,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
how
long
after
the
hit
and
run
episode
was
it
before
he
was
apprehended?
chief
justice
burger
any
evidence
taken
on
whether
he
was
under
the
use
of
drugs
at
that
time?
chief
justice
burger
anything
in
the
judge's
action
that
indicated
that
he
took
that
into
account?
chief
justice
burger
hasn't
the
parole
superseded
that
sentence?
chief
justice
burger
hasn't
the
parole
superseded
the
revocation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cherrick.
chief
justice
burger
is
it
clear
that
your
client
is
now
on
parole?
chief
justice
burger
he
is
at
large.
chief
justice
burger
let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question
quite
close
to
this.
suppose
that
after
the
verdict
of
guilt
on
his
drug
charge
but
before
the
sentence,
he
had
then
been
involved
in
this
hit
and
run
situation,
and
that
on
the
sentencing
then
the
judge
said
to
him,
i
was
giving
serious
consideration
to
putting
you
on
probation,
but
here
within
weeks
after
this
verdict
you
committed
this
other
offense,
and
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
am
not
going
to
put
you
on
probation.
you
are
hereby
sentenced
to
whatever
the
sentence
was.
would
you
have
a
constitutional
question,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
burger
how
do
you--
chief
justice
burger
--go
ahead,
finish.
chief
justice
burger
that
is
what
you
read
out
of
morrissey
and
gagnon?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
have
just
looked
at
both
of
them,
and
one
of
us
needs
to
reread
them
again,
because
i
don't
find
anything
in
either
of
those
cases
that
you
have
been
arguing
here.
chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
think
his
reasons
were
on
this
record?
was
it
not
the
commission
of
a
subsequent
offense
within
weeks
after
he
was
put
on
probation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
