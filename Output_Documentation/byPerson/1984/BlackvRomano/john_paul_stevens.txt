justice
stevens
yes.
for
what
additional
period
of
time?
justice
stevens
as
a
matter
of
missouri
law,
upon
a
revocation,
did
the
judge
actually
have
any
alternative
except
to
do
what
he
did?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
going
back
to
my
earlier
question,
supposing
the
missouri
law
really
does
allow
the
judge
to
exercise
a
variety
of
options
in
this
situation,
but
the
judge
made
a
statement
on
the
record
that
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
thought
he
had
no
option,
that
he
thought
he
had
to
do
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
it
later
turned
out
he
was
wrong.
would
that
be
a
ground
for
a
collateral
attack
like
this
on
the
sentencing.
justice
stevens
as
long
as
whatever
he
does
is
within
the
range
of
permissible
conduct
at
the
time,
then
there
is
no
constitutional
review
at
all?
justice
stevens
we
have
been
assuming
no
violation
of
law,
just
a
misunderstanding
of
the
range
of
options
open
to
the
judge,
but
he
picked
one
that
was
within
the
range,
but
based
on
a
faulty
understanding
of
the
fact
that
there
were
other--
justice
stevens
--that
is
my
hypothetical.
justice
stevens
there
would
be
no
review
as
a
matter
of
missouri
law
in
my
hypothetical,
i
don't
think,
would
there?
justice
stevens
yes.
in
this
case
there
was
a
revocation
hearing,
i
take
it.
justice
stevens
isn't
there
this
difference
between
the
two?
i
don't
know
if
it
is
constitutionally
significant
or
not,
but
everybody...
i
mean,
every
judge
knows
at
the
time
of
original
sentencing
that
he
has
alternatives,
and
presumably...
i
mean,
it
is
fair
to
presume
he
has
always
thought
about
different
possibilities
before
he
imposed
the
sentence.
but
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
judges
who
think
that
a
parole
revocation
automatically
and
necessarily
leads
to
the
imposition
of
the
original
sentence,
because
it
happens
so
often,
and
we
don't
even
know
what
the
law
is
in
missouri.
that
is
what
puzzles
me.
justice
stevens
mr.
cherrick,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
keeps
running
through
my
mind?
supposing
this
judge
had
said,
i
told
you
at
the
original
sentencing
hearing
that
if
you
violate
any
condition
of
parole,
no
matter
bow
trivial,
the
original
sentence
will
be
imposed.
i
think
that
is
good
policy,
because
if
i
enforce
that
strict
rule,
people
in
general
are
more
apt
to
obey
the
conditions
of
parole,
and
that
is
all
i
am
doing
is
carrying
out
my
threat.
and
then
he
went
ahead.
would
that
comply
with
the
constitution?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
at
the
time
of
sentencing
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
know
that
the
conditions
are
not
absolute,
that
if
it
is
a
minor
violation,
that
will
be
taken
into
account?
should
he
know
what
the
exact
facts
are,
or
should
he
be
misled
by
being
told
it
is
an
absolute
condition?
what
is
the
proper
thing
for
the
trial
judge
to
do
at
sentencing?
