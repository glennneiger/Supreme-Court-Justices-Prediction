one
factual
question
about
the
statute.
does
this
apply
to
out-of-state
coverage?
justice
stevens
you
could
write
a
policy
on
a
multi-state
plan
that
did
not
have
the
mental
coverage
in
it
for
the
people
who
are
not
in
massachusetts,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
even
though
the
issuing
insurance
company...
i
don't
know
where
your
headquarters
are.
okay,
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
stevens
they
are
not
sitting
next
to
each
other,
but
i
understand
the
example.
[laughter]
that
is
so
even
though
the
policy
is
issued
in
massachusetts.
justice
stevens
ms.
kelly,
may
i
ask
one
question?
does
the
record
tell
us...
or
maybe
i
should
know...
the
relative
proportion
of
uninsured
and
insured
plans?
justice
stevens
most
of
them
are
insured?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
right
there,
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
thrust
of
the
argument
that
at
the
very
least
it
does
control
one
of
the
substantive
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
would
ordinarily
be
a
subject
of
mandatory
bargaining?
justice
stevens
well,
if
you
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
said
in
so
many
words
we
will
have
health
insurance,
dental
insurance,
about
six
different
things,
but
we
will
not
provide
any
coverage
for
mental
illness
and
then
you
impose
the
statute
on
it.
you
really
are
modifying
the
terms
of
the
bargaining
agreement.
justice
stevens
i
forgot.
there
is
another
term,
that
we
want
to
have
an
insured
plan
too.
