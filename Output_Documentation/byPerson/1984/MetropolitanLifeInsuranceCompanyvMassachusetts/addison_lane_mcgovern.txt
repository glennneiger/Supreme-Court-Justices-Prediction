mr.
addison
lane
mcgovern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
mr.
greenfield
mentioned,
i
will
address
the
appellants'
second
issue
on
this
appeal,
national
labor
relations
act
preemption
of
section
47b.
here
the
focus
is,
of
course,
not
on
the
express
language
of
a
statutory
exemption
provision,
but
on
an
implied
preempted
intent
derived
from
the
purposes
or
objectives
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
federal
labor
policy
served
by
that
act.
appellents
in
essence
say
this:
section
47b
undercuts
the
federal
labor
policy
that
this
court
has
termed
the
fundamental
premise
of
the
nlra,
private
bargaining
by
the
parties
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
without
official
compulsion
over
the
substantive
terms
of
the
agreement
whether
that
compulsion
be
by
the
states
or
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
to
this
end
appellants
make
three
principal
points.
first,
this
court's
decisions
in
oliver
and
alessi
establish
that
when
a
state
law
does
exercise
compulsion
over
substantive
terms,
when
the
law
by
its
legal
effect
limits
or
restricts
the
parties'
solution
of
a
problem
which
congress
has
required
them
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
towards
solving,
the
state
law
is
properly
preempted.
for
this
protective
rule
to
apply,
however,
the
subject
involved
must
be
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
and
there
must
be
no
other
federal
legislation
evidencing
a
congressional
intent
to
authorize
or
allow
as
an
exception
the
particular
form
of
state
interference
under
study.
second,
section
47b,
as
we
shall
see,
does
exercise
compulsion
over
the
substantive
terms
of
insured,
collectively
bargained
benefit
plans.
it
does
limit
by
its
legal
effect
the
parties'
solution
with
respect
to
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
health
benefits,
more
specifically
mental
health
benefits.
third,
there
isn't
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
applies
here.
there
is
no
federal
statute
authorizing
this
form
of
state
intrusion,
nor
is
there
a
broad
exception
for
public
health
laws
as
the
court
below
has
proposed
for
the
purpose
of
preemption
here
is
not
the
preservation
of
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb,
the
purpose
here
is
the
protection
from
state
regulation
of
a
subject
matter
that
congress
has
intended
to
leave
unregulated.
as
this
court
has
emphasized
in
two
very
recent
decisions,
brown
against
the
hotel
workers
and
belknap
against
hale,
preemption
grounded
on
this
purpose
is
not
rebuttal,
not
presumptive,
not
rebuttal,
and
doesn't
encompass
exceptions
of
the
types
that
are
associated
with
the
garman
line
preemption
theory.
if
congress
intended
the
matter
to
be
unregulated,
then
regulation
by
a
state
does
constitute
an
obstacle
to
the
purposes
of
congress
and
preemption
is
warranted.
now,
what
does
47b
do,
what
is
its
effect
in
the
collective
bargaining
context?
under
section
47b
the
parties
to
insured,
collectively
bargained
benefit
plans
covering
massachusetts
residents
are
faced
with
we
say
a
difficult,
no-win
choice.
either
way,
whatever
alternative
is
chosen,
they
are
compelled
to
arrive
at
a
result
which
differs
from
the
one
they
would
have
arrived
at
in
the
absence
of
the
state
statute
and
mandatory
subjects
of
collective
bargaining
are
directly
involved.
one
alternative,
of
course,
is
to
succumb
to
the
statute's
mandate
and
to
accept
the
change
in
the
plan's
terms
to
include
the
mental
health
benefits
specified
in
the
statute.
the
other
alternative
is
to
give
up
all
health
insurance,
to
operate
as
an
uninsured
plan
so
that
the
terms
of
section
47b
can't
take
hold.
but,
of
course,
this
too
means
a
change
is
compelled
with
respect
to
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining.
the
decision
whether
to
have
insured
benefits,
the
decision
whether
to
have
insurance
as
opposed
to
uninsured
benefits
is
itself
such
a
mandatory
subject.
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
the
first
alternative
succumbing
to
the
state-imposed
solution
can
very
often
result
in
a
benefits
package
that
the
workers
distinctly
do
not
want.
there
is
only
so
much
money
available
for
wages
and
benefits.
it
is
one
finite
piece
of
pie.
a
state
command
to
insert
or
to
increase
a
mental
health
benefit
means
that
other
more
desired
benefits
must
be
omitted
or
reduced.
there
was
very
vivid
testimony,
as
mr.
greenfield
mentioned,
at
the
trial
by
james
dawson,
an
ex-plummer
who
organized
many
of
the
early
plans,
benefit
plans,
in
new
hampshire.
new
hampshire
union
members,
using
his
words,
were
antagonistic
and
belligerent
about
the
new
hampshire
mandated
benefit
law
because
they
had
to
give
up
the
vision
and
the
dental
benefits
that
they
really
wanted
to
make
way
for
the
mental
health
benefits
which
happened
to
be
something
that
they
didn't
want.
the
second
alternative,
giving
up
insurance,
has,
of
course,
undesirable
consequences
as
well
because
many
plans
can't
safely
operate
without
the
protection
and
stability
of
insurance
and
this
is
particularly
true
of
small
and
medium
sized
plans
and
particularly
those
in
cyclical
industries
like
the
construction
industries
in
new
england.
but,
in
the
end
the
conflict
with
federal
labor
law
doesn't
depend
on
which
choice
the
parties
make.
the
conflict
lies
in
the
state-imposed
restriction
on
the
parties'
freedom
of
choice,
the
state's
interference
with
the
parties'
own
solution
of
a
problem
that
congress
has
required
them
to
solve.
now,
the
court
below
conceded
that
section
47b,
and
i
quote,
"effectively
controls
the
content
of
insured
welfare
benefit
plans.
"
including
collectively
bargained
plans.
nevertheless,
it
declined
to
rule
in
favor
of
federal
preemption,
relying
instead
on
two
proposed
exceptions
to
preemption,
exceptions
that
this
court,
the
supreme
court,
has
never
used.
now,
one
of
these
proposed
exceptions,
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
we
are
leaving
for
our
brief.
the
act
itself
provides
that
its
provisions
simply
do
not
affect
in
any
manner
the
application
of
the
nlra.
the
second
proposed
preemption
exception
for
what
is
termed
public
health
laws
deserves
one
additional
comment.
as
was
mentioned
earlier,
no
such
exception
is
applicable
where
the
purpose
is
the
protection
of
matters
congress
intended
to
leave
unregulated.
the
tension
between
the
federal
interest
in
guarding
national
labor
policy
and
the
state
interest
in
regulating
health
and
safety
can
be
and
has
been
alleviated
in
another
way.
brown,
belknap,
oliver,
alessi,
all
of
them
permit
intrusive
state
legislation
whenever
congress
has
specifically
demonstrated
an
intent
to
allow
the
particular
type
of
state
intrusion.
congress
in
osha,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
has
expressly
authorized
the
states
to
legislate
concerning
various
occupational,
safety
and
health
issues.
a
number
of
them
have
done
so.
in
fact,
much
of
the
existing
state
legislation
in
the
employment
area
that
we
know
is
there,
laws
concerning
minimum
wages,
maximum
work
weeks,
child
labor,
sex
discrimination,
age
discrimination,
unemployment
compensation,
workers
compensation
can
be
explained
in
exactly
this
manner.
congress
in
various
federal
laws
has
deliberately
and
selectively
authorized
the
states
to
regulate
those
aspects
of
employment
which
in
the
view
of
congress
should
be
subjected
to
state
regulation
within
limits
set
by
congress,
notwithstanding
the
encroachment
on
federal
labor
policy.
congress
has
not,
however,
authorized
the
form
of
state
intrusion
produced
by
section
47b.
now,
the
fundamental
premise
of
our
national
labor
policy
is
that
the
goal
of
industrial
peace
is
best
served
by
allowing
the
parties
the
freedom
and
flexibility
to
thrash
out
their
own
solution
to
problems
of
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
unrestricted
by
solutions
imposed
by
either
the
state
legislatures
or
the
nlrb
except
where
congress
specifically
indicates
otherwise.
interference
here,
we
say,
with
that
policy
is
plain,
the
exceptions
proposed
are
not
applicable,
and
preemption
therefore
is
warranted.
