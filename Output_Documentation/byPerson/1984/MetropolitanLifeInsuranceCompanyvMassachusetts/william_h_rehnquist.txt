justice
rehnquist
the
supreme
judicial
court
held
invalid
the
part
that
attempted
to
directly
regulate
the
plan,
didn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
didn't
it
also
hold
it
was
invalid?
justice
rehnquist
assumed
by
everybody.
justice
rehnquist
but
that
is
true
of
any
resident
of
massachusetts
operating
under
this
statute,
isn't
it,
that
they
may
have
to
give
up
some
benefits
that
they
want
in
order
to
get
the
unwanted
perhaps
mental
health
benefit.
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
see
why
it
follows
that
it
is
incorrect.
justice
rehnquist
but
it
also
exempted
from
the
preemption
state
laws
pertaining
to
insurance.
justice
rehnquist
how
about
a
law
that
says
insurance
companies
have
to
insure
people
who
are
otherwise
uninsurable,
kind
of
a
risk
pool,
would
you
say
that
is
a
regulation
of
insurance?
justice
rehnquist
would
you
say
it
is
a
regulation
of
insurance
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act?
justice
rehnquist
but
these
kinds
of
statutes
are
requiring
an
insurance
policy
to
cover
certain
risks
if
they
covered
others
are
not
brand
new
as
i
understand
it.
justice
rehnquist
i
can
see
that
each
law
has
a
different
effect
but
why
is
one
less
the
regulation
of
insurance
than
the
other?
justice
rehnquist
i
would
think
regulating
the
business
of
insurance
would
mean
doing
whatever
the
legislature
thought
wise
to
govern
how
that
business
is
carried
out.
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
is
certainly
a
lot
left
of
a
preemption
clause.
even
assuming
all
the
parade
of
horribles
you
suggest
would
follow,
a
plan
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
get
insurance.
justice
rehnquist
part
of
that
stands
for
the
way
congress
phrased
the
exemption
from
the
preemption
clause.
why
did
congress
put
in
the
exception
for
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
rehnquist
can
you
contribute
anything
to
our
understanding,
ms.
kelly,
about
why
this
insurance
modification
of
the
general
preemption
section
was
enacted
by
congress?
