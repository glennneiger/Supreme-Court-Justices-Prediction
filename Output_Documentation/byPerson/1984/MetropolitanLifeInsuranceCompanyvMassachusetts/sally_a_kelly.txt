ms.
sally
a.
kelly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
commonwealth's
view
there
are
two
issues
before
the
court
today.
first,
is
section
47b
a
state
insurance
law?
if
it
is
erisa
clearly
excepts
section
47b
from
preemption.
second,
did
congress
intend
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
preempt
state
insurance
laws
such
as
47b?
as
to
these
two
questions
i
would
like
to
make
three
points.
first,
section
47b
is
a
state
insurance
law.
second,
insurers
press
today
for
this
court
to
make
policy
judgments.
contrary
to
policy
judgments
and
directives
already
made
by
the
congress
in
plain
language
in
erisa,
the
commonwealth
suggests
that
this
court
should
decline
the
invitation.
and,
third,
federal
labor
policy
does
not
require
preemption
of
section
47b.
turning
to
point
one,
why
do
i
say
section
47b
is
a
state
insurance
law?
first,
in
examining
it,
it
prescribes
minimum
amounts
of
mental
health
benefits
that
must
be
included
in
insurance
policies
in
massachusetts.
it
unquestionably
spreads
the
risk
of
mental
health
care
among
all
insureds
in
massachusetts
and
in
that
sense
it
is
a
reflection
of
a
legislative
judgment
that
the
costs
of
mental
health
care
should
be
underwritten
by
insurance
policies
and
the
risk
of
those
costs
should
be
shared.
second,
section
47b
prescribes
the
term
to
be
included
in
an
insurance
policy.
obviously
then
section
47b
is
concerned
with
the
type
of
policy
that
can
be
issued
by
an
insurer
doing
business
in
massachusetts.
third,
section
47b
imposes
its
requirements
on
insurance
companies.
it
alters
the
voluntary
market
for
insurance.
in
each
of
these
three
respects,
i
would
suggest
section
47b
fits
squarely
within
the
tradition
of
insurance
regulations
discussed
by
this
court
in
sec
versus
national
securities,
the
classic
case
discussing
the
meaning
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
in
this
sense
then
the
commonwealth
suggests
section
47b
fits
squarely
within
the
tradition
of
insurance
regulation
under
the
mccarran-ferguson.
that
act,
which
was
enacted
by
the
congress
in
1945
at
the
request
of
insurance
companies,
i
might
add,
declared
that
the
states
would
have
primacy
in
the
regulation
of
insurance
in
the
federal
system.
section
47b
satisfies
criteria
this
court
has
used
in
interpreting
that
act
constitutes
the
basis
that
many
state
and
federal
courts
have
used
to
uphold
mandated
benefit
statutes
very
similar
to
section
47b.
now,
turning
to
erisa
itself,
we
find
a
statute
enacted
subsequent
to
the
mccarran-ferguson
and
after
a
series
of
decisions
by
this
court
defining
insurance
for
mccarran-ferguson
purposes.
erisa
contains
four
clauses
of
relevance
today.
first,
there
is
erisa's
general
preemption
clause
which
clearly,
generally
preempts
all
state
laws
that
relate
to
employee
benefit
plans,
but
that
clause
is
followed
by
the
so-called
insurance
savings
clause.
in
this
clause,
congress
provided
that,
and
i
quote,
"any
law
of
any
state
which
regulates
insurance.
"
is
excepted
from
erisa's
general
preemption
scheme.
the
commonwealth
believes
that
this
clause
constitutes
an
explicit
reaffirmation
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act's
directive
that
the
states
are
to
have
primacy
in
the
regulation
of
insurance.
third,
the
third
clause
in
erisa
is
the
so-called
demur
clause.
in
that
clause
congress
prohibited
the
states
from
carrying
on
historical
practice
of
directly
seeking
to
regulating
employee
benefit
plans.
the
demur
clause
in
that
sense
functions
as
a
remedy
for
the
historic
practice
by
the
states.
the
fourth
clause
of
relevance
in
erisa
is
an
explicit
affirmation
of
existing
federal
law.
erisa
contains
a
clause
that
says
erisa
shall
not
be
construed
so
as
to
alter,
amend,
modify,
invalid,
impair
or
supersede
any
other
federal
law.
the
commonwealth
suggests
that
the
preexisting
mccarran-ferguson
act
was
thus
explicitly
reaffirmed
in
the
erisa
preemption
scheme.
and,
while
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
in
erisa
congress
sought
to
broadly
preempt
state
law,
congress
with
very
plain
language
clearly
excepted
state
insurance
laws
from
the
broad
preemption
scheme.
ms.
sally
a.
kelly
your
honor,
on
that
point
i
would
say
that
the
legislative
history,
while
scant
on
the
subject
of
the
insurance
savings
clause,
recognizes
that
congress
intended
that
there
be
certain
exceptions
to
the
broad
preemption
scheme.
at
the
same
time
i
would
add
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
erisa's
main
focus
is
on
pension
regulation.
welfare
benefit
plans
receive
much
less
regulation
in
the
erisa
scheme
than
pension
plans.
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
one
reason
for
this
less
regulation
is
that
congress
understood
that
the
states
were
going
to
continue
their
usual
role
of
regulating
insurance
companies
and
thereby
providing
significant
protection
to
employee
welfare
plan
holders
who
receive
benefits
through
the
purchase
of
insurance.
turning
now
to
the
policy--
ms.
sally
a.
kelly
--the
record
reveals
that
the
vast
majority
are
in
insured
plans.
ms.
sally
a.
kelly
that
were
before
the
massachusetts
court
at
a
trial,
justice
stevens.
turning
now
the
policy
questions
before
the
court,
the
insurers
are
today
pressing
in
a
real
sense
for
this
court
to
alter
policy
judgments
already
made
by
the
congress
in
erisa.
i
would
like
to
discuss
three
of
those
policy
issues.
first,
the
insurers
press
for
this
court
to
read
a
gloss
on
to
the
insurance
savings
clause.
they
insist
that
we
avoid
a
plain
reading
of
the
statute
and
instead
insert
a
word,
"traditional",
in
the
savings
clause.
there
are
several
reasons
for
this
court
to
decline
the
invitation.
first,
there
is
the
plain
language
that
congress
used,
which
is
in
title
ii,
be
given
its
ordinary
meaning.
second,
to
read
a
gloss
on
to
the
savings
clause
freezes
the
states
and
to
a
certain
extent
freezes
insurance
laws
into
a
statically
historic
position.
such
freezing
of
the
states
would
in
a
sense,
we
think,
do
violence
to
the
proposition
that
in
their
separate
realms
the
states
and
the
federal
government
are
free
to
legislate.
ms.
sally
a.
kelly
in
our
view,
the
state...
in
the
absence
of
other
laws
regulating
pregnancy
benefits,
the
state
might
seek
to
enact
a
law
that
provided
a
certain
minimum
amount
of
coverage
for
pregnancy.
ms.
sally
a.
kelly
the
commonwealth
believes
that
in
shaw
the
court
was
dealing
with
an
exception
from
the
erisa
preemption
scheme
for
disability
benefit
plans.
in
the
erisa
scheme,
disability
benefit
plans,
which
is
what
shaw
was
concerned
with,
are
separate
from
erisa.
entire
plans
are
excepted
from
the
application
of
erisa.
so,
a
plan
that
was
enacted
by
a
state
legislature...
excuse
me,
a
law
that
was
enacted
by
a
state
legislature
saying
that
the
state
disability
laws
were
to
include
a
specific
amount
of
pregnancy
benefits
would
in
its
entirety
be
exempt
from
erisa.
but,
the
law
before
the
court
today--
ms.
sally
a.
kelly
--in
a
sense
the
state
could,
although
to
my
knowledge,
the
pregnancy
benefits
are
usually
provided
in
disability
insurance
laws
which,
as
i
say,
are
exempt
from
erisa
coverage
in
their
entirety.
but,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
erisa
congress
enacted
an
exception
in
the
insurance
savings
clause
that
allows
insurance
laws
to
indirectly
control
the
content
of
employee
benefit
plans.
the
commonwealth
has
never
denied
that
and,
in
fact,
argues
strenuously
that
that
is
something
that
congress
enacted
and
it
is
for
congress
to
change
that
if
it
becomes
a
problem.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
through
the
indirect
regulation
of
insured
employee
benefit
plans
that
is
operative
because
of
the
insurance
savings
clause
any
employee
in
the
united
states
has
been
injured,
any
employee
welfare
has
gone
bankrupt,
or
any
employee
welfare
plan
has
gone
to
self
insurance.
indeed,
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
noted
quite
extensively
in
his
findings
that
the
arguments
regarding
indirect
regulation
had
in
a
sense
constituted
a
failure
of
proof
on
the
part
of
the
insurers
in
this
case.
they
simply
proved
no
injury
based
on
indirect
regulation.
if
the
court
again
reads
traditional
into
erisa
the
court
will
also,
in
our
view,
be
opening
the
flood
gates
to
litigation.
a
torrent
of
cases
will
ensue
asking
this
court
and
other
lower
courts
to
decide
the
boundaries
of
traditional
insurance
regulation.
the
commonwealth
suggests
that
insurance
regulation
has
always
been
a
state
law
function
and
should
remain
as
such.
in
any
event,
in
our
view,
it
is
clear
that
section
47b
is
a
traditional
insurance
law,
for
tradition
in
insurance
regulation
extends
quite
clearly
to
content
control.
there
are
many
examples
of
this
type
of
state
insurance
law
and
one
that
we
would
offer
to
the
court
would
be
auto
insurance
laws.
in
our
state,
massachusetts,
auto
insurance
laws
quite
clearly
are
content
control
laws
and
they
are
traditional
insurance
laws.
they
have
been
around
for
a
long
time,
therefore,
there
is
no
need
for
this
court
to
read
a
gloss
on
to
the
savings
clause
nor
would
any
purpose
be
served
by
it.
insurers
make
additional
policy
arguments.
they,
for
example,
argue
that
in
erisa
congress
established
national
uniformity
in
plan
content
and
in
administration.
that
argument
is
simply
incorrect.
congress
clearly
contemplated
non-uniformity
of
benefit
plan
administration
and
content
in
erisa,
for
if
congress
intended
uniformity,
why
did
it
enact
the
several
exceptions
to
erisa's
general
preemption
scheme?
what
would
be
the
meaning
of
the
insurance
savings
clause?
and,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
in
a
question
to
mr.
greenfield,
insurers'
own
reading
of
the
savings
clause,
that
which
adds
the
gloss
of
traditional
on
to
it,
leads
in
and
of
itself
to
significant
non-uniformities
throughout
the
country
in
benefit
plans.
obviously
state
laws
regulating,
for
example,
premiums
that
insurers
pay
will
have
an
impact
on
plans
in
particular
states.
these
significant
non-uniformities
are
the
result
of
congress'
explicit
leaving
of
insurance
regulation
to
the
states.
in
the
commonwealth's
view,
congress
created
uniformity
in
the
area
of
pension
and
welfare,
reporting,
disclosure,
and
fiduciary
standards
in
erisa.
as
to
questions
regarding
these
areas,
in
erisa
congress
clearly
said
there
will
be
one
answer
and
it
will
be
a
uniform
federal
answer.
but,
as
this
court
noted
in
shaw,
erisa
is
absolutely
silent
as
to
the
content
of
employee
welfare
plans.
the
insurers
press
another
policy
argument
on
this
court.
that
is
the
so-called
self-insurance
issue.
insurers
suggest
that
self-insurance
is
promoted
by
47b
in
that
promotion
of
self-insurance
is
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
erisa.
again,
the
commonwealth
believes
that
the
insurers
are
simply
incorrect.
congress
in
erisa
clearly
contemplated
that
welfare
benefits
could
be
provided,
and
i
quote,
"through
the
purchase
of
insurance
or
otherwise.
"
there
is
an
absolute
failure
of
proof
by
the
insurers
that
the
statute
at
issue
today
promotes
self-insurance,
has
harmed
any
employee,
or
led
to
the
bankruptcy
of
any
plan.
the
insurers
instead
seek
to
argue
what
they
could
not
prove
at
trial,
that
self-insurance
is
some
sort
of
an
evil,
that
this
court
should
in
a
sense
rewrite
erisa
to
make
sure
that
self-insurance
not
occur
in
this
country
in
employee
welfare
plans.
but,
i
would
suggest
self-insurance
is
an
evil
only
for
insurance
companies
for
there
is
an
absolute
failure
of
proof
that
any
employee
welfare
plan
has
been
injured
by
self-insurance
and
obviously
it
is
clear
that
where
a
plan
goes
to
self-insurance
insurance
companies
lose
their
profits.
finally,
any
tendency
to
self-insurance
promoted
by
erisa
is
for
the
congress
to
address
and
not
this
court
and
for
the
congress
to
alter
and
not
this
court.
in
that
sense
the
commonwealth
believes
that
the
insurers
are
in
the
wrong
forum
to
make
that
argument.
finally,
i
would
like
to
address
the
labor
question
before
the
court
today.
from
the
commonwealth's
perspective,
federal
labor
policy
requires
no
other
result.
section
47b
establishes
the
market
place
for
insurance
in
massachusetts.
as
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
another
state
statute
provides
states
regulate
insurance.
insurers
today
who
are
generally
strangers
to
the
collective
bargaining
process
seek
to
have
this
court
declare
that
because
health
benefits
are
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
no
government,
not
the
state
government
nor
the
federal
government,
can
regulate
insurance
purchased
to
provide
benefits
to
employees
covered
by
collective
bargaining.
this
court,
the
commonwealth
suggests,
should
reject
this
argument.
47b
is
a
neutral
state
law.
it
does
not
give
a
weapon
to
either
management
or
labor.
it
does
not
directly
regulate
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
it
applies
only
when
insurance
is
purchased
and
then
it
applies
by
essentially
regulating
the
market
place
for
insurance
in
massachusetts.
section
47b
requires
a
minimum
amount
of
mental
health
benefits.
five
hundred
dollars
for
out-patient
benefits,
for
example.
this
is
a
minimum
above
which
collective
bargaining
agreements
may
go.
it
is
similar
in
that
sense
to
worker's
compensation
laws
or
unemployment
compensation
laws
or
auto
insurance
laws.
and,
section
47b
must
be
read
with
the
knowledge
that
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
congress
declared
that
the
states
regulate
insurance.
nothing
in
federal
labor
policy
requires
any
other
result.
ms.
sally
a.
kelly
i
do
not
agree
with
that
as
stated,
justice
stevens.
i
do
agree
that
section
47b
affects
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
controls
it.
ms.
sally
a.
kelly
well,
justice
stevens,
there
would
be
two
answers
to
that.
first,
section
47b
applies
only
where
insurance
is
purchased.
ms.
sally
a.
kelly
okay.
if
you
wanted
to
have
an
insured
plan,
the...
such
an
insurance
plan
could
not
be
sold
in
massachusetts
nor
could
it
be
purchased.
in
that
sense,
it
would
be
similar
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
an
employer
who
delivered
bread
and
drivers
who
drove
the
trucks
that
delivered
bread.
in
massachusetts
the
drivers
would
have
to
be
covered
by
minimum
amounts
of
auto
insurance.
i
think
it
is
$100,000
worth
of
personal
liability
coverage.
the...
no
insurance
company
in
our
state
could
sell
that
employer
a
plan
that
provided
less
benefits
nor
could
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
seek
to
force
an
insurer
to
sell
such
an
insurance
policy.
instead
the
collective
bargaining
process
could
and
often
do
negotiate
policies
far
higher
than
the
minimum
amounts
required
by
automobile
insurance.
that
points
out
the
absurd
result,
i
think,
of
the
insurers
argument
for
under
their
argument
no
state
insurance
regulation
would
apply
where
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
in
effect.
there
would
be
in
a
sense
a
no-law
land.
where
you
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
management
or
labor
could
use
federal
labor
policy
as
a
refuge
from
state
insurance
laws.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
such
a
result
or
that
this
court
should
rule
for
such
a
result.
there
is
great
irony
in
the
insurers'
arguments
today.
two
federal
statutes
designed
to
protect
workers,
erisa
and
the
national
labor
relations
act,
would
be
obviated
by
insurers
who
seek
a
ruling
that
neither
the
states
nor
the
federal
government
regulate
insurance
sold
to
erisa
employee
welfare
plans
or
to
provide
benefits
under
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
argument
leads
to
the
creation
of
a
regulatory
vacuum
of
enormous
proportion
where
no
one
protects
workers
who
have
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
would
seek
to
have
insurance
coverage
or
who
have
employee
welfare
plans
that
are
insured.
if
this
court
interprets
erisa
as
saving
from
preemption
only
traditional
insurance
laws,
courts
throughout
the
country
will
be
asked
again
and
again
to
decide
is
a
particular
law
traditional?
the
courts
will
in
a
real
sense
be
locked
into
a
static,
