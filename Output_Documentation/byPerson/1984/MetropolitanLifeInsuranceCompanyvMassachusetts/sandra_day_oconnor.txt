o'connor
i
suppose
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
comments
of
senators
javits--
justice
o'connor
--and
dent
there
was
no
direct
reference
to
benefits
under
the
policies
of
insurance,
was
there?
justice
o'connor
mr.
greenfield,
does
the
mccarran-ferguson
acts
provision
have
any
aspects
that
merit
our
attention
as
well
wherein
it
says
that
no
subsequent
act
of
congress
is
going
to
be
construed
to
invalidate
a
state
law
regulating
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
language
is
so
similar
to
the
exemption
that
is
enacted
here
in
the
erisa
act
that
it
might
have
something.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
the
terminology
in
mccarran-ferguson,
i
guess,
is
the
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
and
that
has
been
interpreted
to
cover
insurance
policy
benefits,
hasn't
it?
justice
o'connor
those
regulations
certainly
as
well
create
pockets
of
differing
rules
in
different
states,
do
they
not?
justice
o'connor
the
type
of
regulation
you
are
talking
about,
your
so-called
traditional
regulations.
justice
o'connor
ms.
kelly,
in
your
view
could
a
state
like
massachusetts
specify
the
pregnancy
benefits
that
insurance
policies
must
provide
through
its
regulation
of
insurance
savings
clause?
justice
o'connor
how
would
you
then
reconcile
that
with
the
shaw
case?
justice
o'connor
but,
the
state
could
operate
indirectly
insofar
as
insurance
policies
are
issued
by
requiring
the
same
thing
in
a
way.
