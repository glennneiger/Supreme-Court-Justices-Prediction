mr.
jay
greenfield
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
it
concerns
the
validity
of
a
state
law
which
we
have
been
calling
section
47b.
the
question
is
whether
that
state
law
is
preempted
by
either
of
two
federal
statutes,
erisa
or
the
nlra.
i
will
address
the
erisa
issue
and
my
colleague,
mr.
mcgovern,
will
address
the
nlra
issue.
we
have
between
ourselves
allocated
20
minutes
to
the
erisa
argument
and
i
hope
to
save
some
of
that
time
for
rebuttal.
we
are
concerned
with
section
47b
to
the
extent
that
it
relates
to
welfare
plans
governed
by
erisa.
by
its
express
terms,
that
statute
directly
regulates
and
relates
to
employee
welfare
plans.
the
statute
provides,
and
i
quote,
"that
any
employee's
health
and
welfare
fund
which
provides
hospital
expense
and
surgical
expense
benefits
and
which
covers
massachusetts
residents
shall
provide
certain
specified
benefits
for
mental
or
nervous
conditions.
"
now,
the
statute
also
regulates
and
relates
to
erisa
plans
in
another
respect.
it
provides
that
any
policy
of
insurance
issued
to
an
erisa
plan
shall
furnish
the
same
detailed
benefits.
so,
there
are
two
relevant
parts
to
the
statute,
the
part
that
requires
the
plan
to
provide
the
specified
benefits,
that
is
direct
regulation,
and
the
part
that
requires
policies
purchased
by
those
plans
to
provide
the
same
benefits.
if
the
plan
is
insured,
the
plan
must
provide
those
benefits.
that
is...
for
lack
of
a
better
term...
but
accurately
indirect
regulation.
there
is
no
question
concerning
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
it
is
clear
from
the
very
extensive
report
of
a
legislative
committee
that
the
purpose
is
to
change
the
manner
in
which
mental
health
care
is
funded
and
provided
in
massachusetts.
the
commonwealth
not
only
concedes
this,
the
commonwealth
positively
asserts
it.
there
brief
says
for
one
example
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is,
and
i
quote,
"the
massachusetts
state
legislature
adopted
section
47b
to
address
the
problems
of
treating
mental
illness.
"
another
place
in
the
brief:
"section
47b
implements
a
broad
policy
with
respect
to
treatment
of
mental
illness.
"
so,
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
not
to
prevent
unfair
trade
practices
by
the
insurer
and
it
is
not
to
guarantee
that
the
insurance
company
is
going
to
be
solvent
when
a
claim
is
filed.
the
purpose,
i
submit,
is
not
to
regulate
insurance.
insurance
comes
into
the
picture
only
as
a
means,
a
vehicle,
for
shifting
costs
and
expanding
services.
there
is
no
question
that
this
statute
is
preempted
by
erisa
to
the
extent
it
seeks
to
regulate
plans
directly.
that
was
conceded
by
the
commonwealth
before
a
lessee
insurer
and
those
foreclose
any
fair
dispute
on
the
subject.
nor
can
there
be
any
serious
question
concerning
the
impact
of
47b
as
it
is
construed
by
the
state
and
by
the
majority
of
the
court
below.
if
an
erisa
plan
does
obtain
insurance,
if
it
is
self-insured,
47b
is
preempted.
benefits
cannot--
mr.
jay
greenfield
--the
commonwealth
conceded
its
invalidity
before
that
time
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
noted
that,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jay
greenfield
not
in
the
words
"we
hold
it
is
invalid".
it
was
just
assumed--
mr.
jay
greenfield
--that
is
not
a
serious
question
and
i
don't
think
the
commonwealth
would
contend
otherwise
now.
the
question
here
is
that
if
a
plan
buys
insurance
the
position
is
that
the
benefits
can
be
mandated.
i
mean,
the
commonwealth
says
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
held
that
if
a
plan
chooses
to
buy
insurance
the
state
can
mandate
the
entire
benefits
package,
each
and
every
item
in
it.
now,
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
the
commonwealth
they
don't
suggest
that
this
distinction
between
insured
and
uninsured
plans
makes
any
sense
and
it
really
doesn't.
no
one
has
ever
attempted
to
say
that
is
sensible.
neither
do
they
suggest
that
the
distinction
promotes
a
statutory
purpose.
it
seriously
undermines
that
purpose.
section
3
of
erisa
makes
it
clear
that
there
is
to
be
no
distinction
drawn
between
insured
and
uninsured
plans.
it
provides...
it
defines
welfare
plans,
employee
welfare
plans,
as
those
which
provide
health
benefits,
and
i
quote,
"through
the
purchase
of
insurance
or
otherwise.
"
section
2
of
the
statute
says
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
act
to
present
the
interest
of
participants
in
employee
benefit
plans
and
their
beneficiaries.
yet,
what
we
have
here
is
that
by
making
insurance
disadvantageous
plans
are
induced
to
give
up
the
protection
that
an
insurance
policy
provides.
now,
the
majority
opinion
below
presents
a
multi-state
plan,
the
multi-state
insured
plan
with
several
choices
and
i
submit
they
are
hobson's
choices,
one
choice.
the
plan
can
provide
a
series
of
different
benefit
packages
that
are
tailored
to
the
mandated
benefit
laws
of
particular
states.
if
oregon
has
one
statute,
you
give
the
oregon
benefit.
if
north
carolina
covers
cleft
palates,
you
give
that,
in
massachusetts
you
give
that,
but
the
bottom
line
is
there
is
no
uniform
plan
and
there
is
much
greater
administrative
expense.
employers
and
employees
in
particular
states
will
either
have
to
pay
the
higher
premiums
or
sacrifice
wanted
benefits
for
less
desired
mandated
benefits.
another
choice
that
an
insured
plan
faces
is
this:
assuming
that
the
state
laws
are
not
in
conflict,
the
plans
could
comply
with
the
laws
of
all
states
in
a
uniform
plan.
you
simply
provide
the
most
generous
benefit
given
any
place.
now
to
state
a
self-evident
proposition
that
may
have
been
lost
sight
of
by
the
court
below,
just
as
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
free
lunch,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
free
benefit.
the
mandated
benefit
has
to
be
paid
for.
so,
to
offset
the
additional
expense
you
either
have
to
reduce
wages
or
you
have
to
sacrifice
a
benefit
that
you
want
for
a
benefit
that
you
don't
want
and
there
is
some
very
vivid
testimony
at
the
trial
as
to
how
this
worked.
one
union
had
to
give
up
dental
benefits
and
eyeglass
benefits
that
they
very
badly
wanted
and
had
to
increase
eligibility
requirements
in
order
to
get
mental
health
benefits
about
which
they
were
less
concerned.
mr.
jay
greenfield
that
is
not
only
true,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
opinion
below
is
incorrect,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jay
greenfield
because
congress
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
wanted
the
benefit
package
to
be
a
matter
of
private
choice.
to
take
an
example,
a
coal
miner
has
different
health
priorities,
different
needs,
different
desires
than
an
airplane
pilot
would
have.
and,
congress
very
clearly
left
that
part
to
private
regulation.
mr.
jay
greenfield
i
submit
that
that
does
not
answer
the
question,
that
raises
the
question.
is
this
a
state
law
that
regulates
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
erisa?
and,
to
answer
that
question
you
have
got
to
look
both
at
the
preemption
clause
and
at
the
savings
clause.
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
the
preemption
clause
was
to
be
construed
as
broadly
as
possible.
when
it
went
into
committee,
there
were
two
bills
and
each
bill
said
there
would
be
preemption
in
certain
defined
areas,
those
areas
in
which
erisa
regulated.
when
it
came
out
of
committee,
just
before
it
was
enacted,
the
present
preemption
clause
which
this
court
accurately
described
as
unique
in
its
scope
came
out
saying
that
everything
was
preempted.
and,
the
chief
senators
and
congressmen
involved
in
this,
senator
javits
and
congressman
dent,
they
made
it
very
clear
that
they
were
doing
this
in
order
to
keep
the
states
out
of
this
regulatory
field
entirely.
and,
this
is
really
what
this
court
noted
in
shaw
and
it
is
what
this
court
noted
in
alessi.
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
indirectly
that
which
you
are
precluded
directly.
mr.
jay
greenfield
williams
and
dent.
mr.
jay
greenfield
there
was
not.
there
was
some
legislative
history
making
it
quite
clear
that
in
pension
plans
there
was
supposed
to
be
private
choice
and
there
is
no
rational
way
to
read
the
statute
to
distinguish
in
between
pension
plans
and
employee
benefit
plans.
mr.
jay
greenfield
well,
i
think
it
has
been
held,
and
i
don't
think
seriously
disputed
by
the
commonwealth...
it
was
held
in
the
hewlett-packard
case
in
the
ninth
circuit...
that
erisa
is
a
statute
which
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance,
so
that
aspect
of
the
mccarran
act
doesn't
apply
to.
now,
there
have
been--
mr.
jay
greenfield
--well,
let
me
go
to
mccarran
for
a
second,
justice
o'connor.
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
deals
with
state
statutes
for
the
purpose...
that
is
the
word
the
statute
uses...
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance
and
the
purpose...
unless
you
simply
say
that
a
statute
has
that
purpose
whenever
it
has
the
word
i-n-s-u-r-a-n-c-e
in
it
you
cannot,
i
think,
fairly
say
that
this
massachusetts
statute
is
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
the
purpose
is
to
reallocate
costs
from
the
state
through
the
insurance
companies
to
employers
and
employees
and
to
increase
the
use
of
out-patient
facilities
as
opposed
to
hospitalization.
it
is
spelled
out
very
clearly.
it
is
in
at
least
four
places
in
the
commonwealth's
brief.
but,
mccarran-ferguson
shouldn't
apply
here
for
another
reason.
mr.
jay
greenfield
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance,
yes.
mr.
jay
greenfield
i
don't
think...
well,
this
court
has
considered
that
clause
on
many
occasions,
of
course.
i
am
aware
of
no
case
which
applies
that
clause
to
a
statute
as
to
whether
a
state
can
mandate
benefits.
but,
i
would
go
one
step
further.
i
would
say
that
mccarran-ferguson...
i
would
go
two
steps.
i
would
say
first
of
all
that
mccarran-ferguson
is
of
no
help
in
deciding
this
case
and
i
would
say,
second,
that
if
you
look
to
mccarran-ferguson
it
really
supports
our
position
more
than
the
commonwealth's
position.
the
court
is
very
familiar
with
mccarran-ferguson.
it
arose
as
a
reaction
to
southeastern
underwriters
when
paul
versus
virginia
was
overruled
in
about
1944
or
1945
and
there
was
a
great
fear
that
this
would
knock
out
all
the
state
regulation
of
insurance
no
matter
where
it
was.
this
court
had
held
in
the
national
securities
case
and
royal
drug,
pireno,
time
and
time
again
that
what
you
were
trying
to
do
is
give
states
the
power
that
they
had
before
southeastern
underwriters.
now,
before
southeastern
underwriters
and
really
up
until
this
time,
up
until
this
case
almost,
when
people
spoke
about
the
regulation
of
insurance
what
they
were
talking
about
is
to
protect
the
insured
from
the
insurer,
to
protect
overreaching
by
the
insurance
company.
mr.
jay
greenfield
i
would
say
that
is
a
different
question.
mr.
jay
greenfield
i
would
say
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
it
might
be
but
i
really
haven't
considered
that
question
until
this
second.
i
would
say
that
might
be
but
i
am
not
just
sure.
that
is
much
different
though
than
what
we
have
here.
what
we
have
here
is
a
state
is
telling
the
insured
you
have
to
buy
something
you
don't
want.
it
is
not
simply
telling
the
insurance
company
you
have
to
maintain
certain
reserves,
you
can't
engage
in
fraud,
you
have
to
pass
certain
licensing
requirement.
it
is
telling
the
insured
you
must
purchase
a
benefit
you
don't
want,
instead
of
getting
the
eyeglass,
you
have
to
get
the
mental
health
treatment.
i
don't
think
that
is
the
type
of
law
that
is
a
regulation
of
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
the
savings
clause
if...
and
this
is
a
very
important
if...
if
you
are
going
to
read
the
savings
clause
and
the
preemption
clause
together
so
as
to
give
vitality
to
both.
we
are
not
saying
that
all
of
those
laws,
these
hypothetical
laws
have
to
go
out.
we
are
saying
just
the
contrary.
the
regulation
of
insurance
as
it
meant
at
the
time
of
mccarran-ferguson
and
as
to
a
substantial
degree
it
meant
in
1974
when
erisa
came
on
board
never
contemplated
this
type
of
statute.
mr.
jay
greenfield
well,
the
statute
that
says
that
the
insured
must
purchase
a
policy
with
that
risk,
that
didn't
exist
when
the
savings
clause
first
came
in
in
1970.
this
is
much
different,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
than
the
statute
which
says
you
must
offer
it.
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
mr.
jay
greenfield
because
regulation
of
insurance
traditionally
has
meant
protecting
the
insured
and
insuring
the...
and
guaranteeing
the
insurance
company's
solvency.
this
does--
mr.
jay
greenfield
--but,
this
is
regulating...
if
you
take
the
literal
definition
the
way
the
state
is
taking
it
and
you
say
that
whenever
there
is
the
word
"insurance"
it
is
saved
and
it
is
not
preempted
there
is
nothing
left
to
the
preemption
statute,
the
preemption
clause.
you
can
no
longer
have
uniformity.
i
submit
it
is
simply--
mr.
jay
greenfield
--that
is
right.
but,
erisa
seems
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
a
plan
should
have
an
option
and
what
is
the
sense
of
that.
i
submit
what
is
the
sense
of
having
a
rule
that
says
that
if
you
give
up
the
security
of
insurance
you
then
can
have
the
benefits
package
that
you
want,
but
if
you
are
going
to
take
insurance
you
then
have
to
take
the
mandated
benefit.
the
result
of
that
is
that
it
really
increases
the
likelihood
that
when
the
claim
is
made
there
won't
be
funds
there.
i
submit
it
is
almost
a
whimsical
distinction
to
say
that
if
you
are
uninsured
you
are
not
regulated,
but
if
you
are
insured
you
have
to
give
the
benefits
we
mandate.
there
is
no
useful
policy
served
by
that.
it
is
just
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
erisa.
mr.
jay
greenfield
well,
when
congress
first
put...
i
think
there
is
quite
a
good
reason
for
that
because
they
didn't
want...
the
preemption
clause
is
quite
broad
and
it
became
broader
during
the
summer
of
1974.
congress
didn't
want
a
lot
of
arguments
being
made
that
traditional
insurance
regulation,
advertising,
fraud,
reserves,
that
they
could
be
escaped
by
saying
i
am
dealing
with
an
erisa
plan.
an
insurance
company
shouldn't
be
able
to
say
you
can't
attack
me
for
false
advertising,
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
because
my
advertising
is
directed
to
an
erisa
plan
and
it
is
preempted.
that
was
the
type
of
thing
congress
was
trying
to
say.
when
congress
first--
mr.
jay
greenfield
--what
type
of
regulation?
mr.
jay
greenfield
yes,
but
they
are
not
regulation
of
plans.
it
is
a
big
difference
to
tell
an
insurance
company
you
can
only
invest
in
certain
types
of
debt
securities
than
it
is
to
tell
a
plan
you
have
to
purchase
coverage
for
cleft
palate
or
mental
health
if
you
are
going
to
be
insured,
but
if
you
are
not
insured
you
don't
have
to
purchase
it.
yes,
there
are
different
regulations.
one
state
can
require
that
you
have
so
much
in
debt
and
another
state
can
require
you
to
hold
less
in
debt.
but
that
is
not
a
regulation
of
a
plan.
what
we
have
here
is
a
regulation
of
a
plan.
it
is
indirect,
but,
as
i
said,
an
indirect
regulation
is
no
different
than
a
direct.
with
the
court's
permission
i
will
reserve
whatever
time--
mr.
jay
greenfield
--it
applies
to
any
massachusetts
resident
no
matter
where
the
statute
is
issued.
mr.
jay
greenfield
that
plan
couldn't
violate
massachusetts
statute
unless
there
were
employees--
mr.
jay
greenfield
--the
statute
is
designed
to
apply
no
matter
where
the
policy
is
issued
so
long
as
it
is
a
massachusetts
resident.
and,
you
get
the
fairly
bizarre
result
and
you
really
get
it
of
two
people
sitting
next
to
each
other,
one
who
lives
in
massachusetts,
one
who
lives
in
albany,
new
york,
and
they
are
getting
different
benefits.
and
that
is
just
the
type
of
thing
that
congress
didn't
want.
mr.
jay
greenfield
we
are--
mr.
jay
greenfield
--i
don't
want
to
say
none
are
because
i
am
not
sure.
we
are
dealing
here...
this
case
focused
on
policies
that
were
not
issued
in
massachusetts.
but
the
argument
really
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
the
preemption
is
total
and
it
shouldn't
be
evaded
by
this
type
of
indirection.
mr.
jay
greenfield
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
greenfield
fine.
justice
stevens
asked
a
question
about
self-insurance.
i
would
note
that
there
has
been
a
dramatic
increase
in
self-insurance
over
the
past
few
years.
this
is
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
one
of
the
cases
that
my
friend
did
not
mention
but
which
is
quite
important
in
this
area
is
alessi.
now,
the
position
argued
by
the
commonwealth
effectively
permits
the
overruling
of
alessi
by
a
state.
in
alessi,
as
the
court
will
recall,
new
jersey
has
a
statute
which
said
that
you
could
not
set
off
workmen's
compensation
against
benefits
from
an
erisa
plan.
this
court
said
that
that
was
preempted
and
indirect
regulation
was
just
as
bad
as
direct
regulation.
if
new
jersey
passed
a
statute
which
said
that
every
insurance
policy
shall
provide,
that
there
shall
be
no
setoff
as
a
result
of
a
workmen's
compensation
recovery,
then,
according
to
my
friend,
that
would
come
within
the
savings
clause
and
new
jersey
could
do
it
and
alessi
become
meaningless.
the
state
can
mandate
absolutely
everything.
i
want,
in
about
the
minute
or
so
remaining,
just
to
talk
about
regulatory
vacuum
as
if
this
was
something
terrible.
my
friend
finished
up
mentioning
that.
what
regulatory
vacuum
means
is
that
the
employers
and
employees
pick
the
benefits
they
need
and
are
willing
to
pay
for.
and
while
we
have
heard
words
of
irony
about
the
insurance
companies,
speaking
about
public
policy,
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case
the
line
up
of
amici
is
that
on
our
side
is
the
afl-cio,
all
the
major
employers,
and
a
lot
of
small
unions,
the
people
who
pay
for
this,
the
people
who
get
it,
are
the
people
who
want
to
pick
their
own
benefits
and
that
is
what
the
preemption
clause
is
designed
to
do.
thank
you.
