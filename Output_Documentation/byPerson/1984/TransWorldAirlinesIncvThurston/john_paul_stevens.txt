justice

may
i
think
this
through
out
loud
with
you
for
just
a
second?
is
the
class
of
persons
we
are
concerned
with
properly
defined
as
pilots
who
are
no
longer
eligible
for
one
reason
or
another
to
be
in
command
and
who
want
to
become
flight
engineers?
justice
stevens
no,
well,
those
aggrieved
are
a
subclass
of
the
class
i
have
described.
justice
stevens
i
know,
but
is
it
correct,
and
i
am
not
sure
this
answers
it,
is
it
correct
that
everybody
in
the
class
except
those
who
reach
the
age
of
60
have
a
contractual
right
to
downbid
as
i
described
the
class?
justice
stevens
but
is
there
anything
that--
justice
stevens
--is
there
anything
other
than
the
fact
that
they
are
60
years
of
age
that
disqualifies
them
from
the
downbidding
right?
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
isn't
the
difference
is
that
in
your
hypothetical,
at
the
time
the
two
people
apply,
neither
of
them
is
a
member
of
the
bfoq,
whereas
in
the
case
before
us,
at
the
time
the
application
to
downgrade
is
made,
the
person
who
applies
is
then
the
member
of
a
bfoq?
and
is
that
a
significant
difference?
maybe
it
is
just
that
the
statute
says
so.
i
don't
know.
that's
the
trouble
with
hypotheticals.
justice
stevens
you
hypothesize
away
the
statutory
provision.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
stronger
argument
is
not
that
the
hypothetical
is
the
same,
but
rather,
that
the
bfoq
is
made
for
the
purpose
of
determining
eligibility
to
fly
airplanes,
not
to
be
flight
engineers.
justice
stevens
i
don't
know
whether
the
language
will
accommodate
that,
but
that
is...
if
there
is
merit
in
your
position,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
argument.
