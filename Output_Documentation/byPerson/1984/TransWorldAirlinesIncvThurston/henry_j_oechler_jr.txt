mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
to
consider
three
issues
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act:
one,
a
standard
of
liability
under
the
adea;
two,
a
standard
for
wilfullness
under
the
adea;
and
three,
whether
a
union
can
be
monetarily
liable
under
the
adea.
now,
twa,
like
all
major
airlines,
must
adhere
to
the
safety
regulations
of
the
federal
aviation
administration.
one
of
these
safety
regulations
requires
that
a
captain
cannot
serve
as
a
captain
beyond
the
age
of
60,
and
the
issue
before
this
court
is,
to
what
extent,
if
any,
the
adea
requires
an
employer
to
find
another
job
for
that
captain
nor
anyone
else
unable
to
perform
in
his
former
position
because
of
age.
now,
in
an
effort
to
make
just
such
an
accommodation,
twa
took
the
lead
amongst
the
airline
industry
and
adopted
a
policy
of
relying
on
the
existing
neutral
bidding
procedures
of
its
working
agreement.
over
a
four-year
period,
this
policy
resulted
in
an
83
percent
success
rate
for
those
captains
seeking
to
serve
as
flight
engineers...
for
those
captains
seeking
to
serve
beyond
age
60
in
a
position
not
subject
to
the
faa
rule,
namely,
that
of
flight
engineer,
which
is
the
third
seat
in
the
cockpit.
and
while
twa
was
experiencing
an
83
percent
success
rate,
the
rest
of
the
airline
industry
during
this
four-year
period
had
a
zero
percent
success
rate.
nevertheless,
despite
this
83
percent
success
rate,
that
was
not
sufficient
for
what
the
eeoc
itself
admits
is
a
handful
of
plaintiffs
who
were
retired
as
captains
because
they
had
been
unable
or
unwilling
to
obtain
a
flight
engineer
bid.
now,
the
court
below
said
that
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
a
virtual
guarantee
to
a
flight
engineer
position,
because
in
certain
limited
and
admittedly
non-age-related
circumstances,
there
is
an
automatic
right
for
a
captain
to
go
to
flight
engineer.
for
example,
under
the
contract,
a
captain
must
maintain
an
faa
first
class
medical
certificate.
if
for
medical
reasons
he
cannot
maintain
that
faa
medical
certificate,
and
can
only
maintain
a
second
class
medical
certificate,
he
is
entitled
under
the
contract
to
revert
to
flight
engineer.
now,
the
court
said,
because
you
did
that
for
what
was
admittedly
a
non-age
reason,
you
must
do
a
similar
type
of
accommodation
with
respect
to
the
plaintiffs
here.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
well,
we
submit
it
is
not
based
on
age.
what
they
are
seeking
here,
the
fact
that
they
want
a
reversion
right
to
flight
engineer
is
strictly
because
of
the
fact
that
you
have
an
age
60
rule
which
prohibits
captain
thurston
and
similarly
situated
plaintiffs
from
continuing
as
a
captain.
if
captain
thurston
had
had
his
way,
he
would
have
wanted
to
fly
long
past
age
60
as
a
captain.
that
was
impossible
because
of
the
faa
rule,
so
what
he
is
seeking
here
is
a
reversionary
right
based
on
the
fact
that
he
reached
age
60,
and
the
court
described
that...
the
dissent
described
that
below
as
apples
versus
oranges,
because
the
fact
that
this
reversionary
right
is
available
to
everyone
on
the
twa
pilot
work
force,
including
captain
thurston,
if
at
age
55
he
had
a
medical
problem,
he
had
lost
his
first
class
medical
certificate,
he
could
have
downbid,
he
could
have
reverted
to
flight
engineer
at
age
55.
but
we
submit
that
the
adea
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
adea
says
you
do
not
now
have
to
create
that
right
based
on
age.
page
12
of
the
house
of
representatives
report
which
accompanied
the
1978
amendments
which
are
at
issue
here
specifically
said,
you
do
not
have
to
provide
special
working
conditions,
and
specifically
said,
based
on
age,
and
specifically
said,
you
do
not
have
to
retrain
and
transfer.
and
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
retraining
captain
thurston
and
transferring
him
from
a
captain
to
flight
engineer.
now,
the
question
of
how
much
an
employer
must
accommodate
its
employees
was
a
subject
of
concern
to
this
court
in
another
case
involving
twa,
in
another
case
involving
the
twa
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
case
was
twa
v.
hardisan,
at
432
us
63,
and
in
that
case,
mr.
hardisan
contended
that
because
of
his
religious
beliefs,
he
was
entitled
not
to
work
on
a
saturday,
despite
the
fact
that
the
seniority
provisions
and
the
working
agreement
were
going
to
require
him
to
work
on
a
saturday.
that
case
arose
under
title
7,
where
there
actually
is
a
specific
provision
about
accommodation,
while...
a
religious
accommodation,
while
here
it
can
only
be...
such
a
claim
for
accommodation
can
only
be
implied,
and
the
court
said
that
you
do
not
have
to
go
that
far...
pages
79
to
81
in
particular,
they
discussed
this
question...
that
the
employer
does
not
have
to
go
that
far
to
accommodate
the
employee.
and
we
submit
that
has
equal
applicability
here,
and
it
is
also
important
to
remember
how
the
posture
of
this
case
arose.
when
twa
announced
its
policy
in
august
of
1978,
it
was
immediately
faced
with
a
lawsuit
from
the
union
contending
that
what
we
had
done
by
allowing
anyone
to
fly
beyond
60,
and
today
we
have
over
150
people
flying
beyond
60,
violated
the
railway
labor
act,
because
we
had
unilaterally
changed
our
wages,
rates,
and
working
conditions.
and
they
also
contended
that
what
we
had
done
was
not
mandated
by
the
adea.
soon
thereafter
the
plaintiffs
came
in
and
said
that
we
hadn't
gone
far
enough.
the
union
said
we
had
gone
too
far.
the
plaintiffs
came
in
several
months
later,
brought
suit
saying
we
hadn't
gone
far
enough
to
accommodate
them.
then
we
were
faced
with
a
third
suit
brought
by
younger
flight
engineers
who
quite
properly
pointed
out
that
they
had
been
put
on
furlough
because
in
a
reduction
in
force
we
had
kept
the
older
people
or
the
payroll
based
on
their
seniority,
and
we
had...
when
we
had
a
reduction
in
force,
the
younger
people
had
gotten
furloughed,
and
they
contended
we
had
again
violated
the
railway
labor
act.
so,
twa
was
faced
with
the
situation
where
it
is
trying
to
comply
with
both
the
contract
and
various
statutes.
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
furnod
decision
that
courts
are
less
competent
to
restructure
business
practices
and
the
law
does
not
require
employers
to
maximize
employee
opportunities,
and
we
believe
that
that
mandate
of
this
court
was
satisfied
here.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
well,
our
contract
allowed
downbidding,
and
prior
to
age
60,
historically
the
contract
did
allow
downbidding,
so
we
felt--
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
--no,
not
automatic.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
for
those
few
specific
situations,
but
the
normal
bidding
procedure--
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
yes,
that
was
provided
in
the
contract.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
arguably
not,
but
those
provisions
have
been
in
the
contract
a
long
time,
and
we
certainly
would
have
been
faced
with
a
claim
by
the
plaintiffs
if
we
did
eliminate
those
types
of
automatic
downbidding
that
that
was
an
effort
at
age
discrimination
because
we
were
eliminating
the
bases
for
their
claims,
and
that
that
would
be
further
evidence
of
age
discrimination.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
we
say
that
that
is
not...
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
contract
that
requires
that
on
the
basis--
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
--well,
when
they
get--
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
--when
they
reach
age
60,
they
are
not
in
a
position
that
they
can
perform
as
captains.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
the
contract
says
that
a
captain...
defines
a
contract...
defines
a
captain
in
section
33(b)
as
someone
who
is
a
pilot
in
command.
now,
when
he
reaches
age
60--
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
--he
is
not
a
pilot
in
command.
what
are
we
to
do
with
him?
and
that
was
the
problem
we
were
faced
with,
and
if
we
then
charged
our
contract,
we
were
faced
with
railway
labor
act
violations.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
we
did,
and
that
is
how
we
got
60.
we
have
60
people
presently
captains,
presently
serving
beyond
the
age
of
60
as
flight
engineers.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
who
bid
down
in
the
normal
bidding
procedures
that
were
in
the
contract
before
the
law
was
amended
in
1978
and
have
continued
to
serve.
plus
we
have
100
career
flight
engineers,
people
who
have
never
gone
above
the
level
of
flight
engineer.
they
have
also
continued
to
serve
beyond
the
age
of
60.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
the
class
that
is
involved
here
insofar
as
who
is
aggrieved
are--
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
--that
is
right,
but
if
at
age
59
and
a
half--
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
--everybody
prior
to
age
60
have
a
right,
and
if
there
is
a
vacancy,
the
company...
and
they
have
the
requisite
seniority,
the
company
awards
them
that
right,
but
when
they
hit
age
60,
the
age
60
rule
comes...
applies
to
them.
we
have
a
neutral
bidding
procedure,
but
the
age
60
rule
applies
to
them,
and
they
hit
age
60,
and
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
them?
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
the
contract
specifically
says
they
have
to
be
pilots
in
command.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
no,
it
is
the
age
60,
a
rule
imposed
by
the
government,
and
now
the
government
is
saying,
we
must
make...
they
are
telling
us
what
we
must
do
with
them,
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
the
ones
who
imposed
the
government
regulation
upon
us
in
the
first
place.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
if
i
may
just
briefly
address
the
willfulness
question,
the
statute
in
section
7(b)
says
the
liquidated
damages
or
double
damages
should
only
be
provided,
only...
that's
the
word
in
the
statute...
only
provided
in
the
case
of
a
willful
violation.
now,
the
eeoc
says
that
the
standard
for
liquidated
damages
is
if
the
employer
knew
that
its
conduct
was
governed
by
the
adea.
that
is
all
the
employer
has
to
know,
and
it
concedes
that,
quote,
end
quote,
only
in
the
rarest
of
cases
will
an
employer
not
know
that
its
conduct
was
going
to
be
covered
by
the
adea.
he
is
going
to
have
to
be
living
in
a
tunnel
not
to
know
that
his
conduct
was
governed
by
the
adea,
and
in
fact
under
the
adea
he
is
required
to
post
a
statute,
so
he
certainly
is
going
to
have
to
know
that
his
conduct
is
governed
by
it.
now,
either
the
word
"only"
means
something,
and
it
means
that
there
is
a
two-tiered
level
of
liability,
and
in
our
brief
we
discuss
the
fact
that
that
is
what
we
believe
the
legislative
history
supports,
or
it
doesn't,
and
we
suggest
that
senator
javits,
when
he
inserted
the
provision
about
liquidated
damages,
it
was
a
substitute
for
a
criminal
provision,
and
two
circuits
have
held
that
that
was
meant
to
be
punitive
in
nature.
and
yet
what
the
eeoc
says
is,
all
you
have
to
do
is
know
that
your
conduct
was
governed
by
the
adea,
therefore
we
hold
you
liable
for
double
damages.
now,
we
submit
that
what
is
required
is
a
specific
intent
to
violate
the
adea,
and
that
is
what
was
meant,
that
was
what
was
meant
by
the
insertion
of
that
provision,
because
that
was
what...
that
was
what
senator
javits
meant
by
the
fact
that
it
should
be
punitive.
now,
i
do
want
to
go
back
for
a
moment
to
this
whole
question
of
liability.
the
provisions
that
the
plaintiffs
talk
about
were
just
as
available
to
everyone
on
the
twa
pilot
work
force.
they
were
available
to
captain
thurston
and
they
were
available
to
everyone
else.
they
are
admittedly
non-age
reasons,
and
what
they
want
to
do
is
take
that
non-age
provision
and
say,
okay,
now,
add
twa
a
new
provision
that
says
for
age
i
am
entitled
to
revert
to
flight
engineer.
and
we
say
that
is
apples
versus
oranges,
as
justice
van
grafelin
said.
now,
the
subject
that
counsel
raised
about
disciplinary
downgrades
is
addressed
in
note
15
of
our
brief.
the
only
instance
that
this
disciplinary
downgrade
arose
during
the
course
of
this
entire
litigation
involved
somebody
who
had
a
specific
prior
right
that
was
given
to
him
by
a
presidential
commission
20
years
ago
for
a
non-age
reason.
and
because
of
that,
we
felt
we
had...
because
we
were
bound
by
certain
arbitration
provisions
under
the
contract,
we
had
no
choice
but
to
allow
him
to
go
down
to
that
position.
now,
twa
directed...
when
twa...
when
the
law
was
passed
in
april,
1978,
twa
still
continued
to
retire
people
until
it
adopted
its
policy
in
august
of
'78.
once
it
adopted
its
policy,
it
reinstated
those
people
who
were
in
the
flight
engineer
position.
if
captain
thurston
had
been
able
to
bid,
and
there
was
no
vacancy
between
april
and
june,
but
there
were
vacancies
in
the
spring
of
'78,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
law,
if
he
had
been
able
to
bid
and
had
gotten
the
flight
engineer
bid
back
in
the
spring
of
'78,
twa's
director,
twa's
vice
president
of
flight
operations
said
in
his
deposition
at
page
268
that
then
he
would
have
been
considered
for
serving
as
a
flight
engineer,
and
been
considered
for
reinstatement
at
that
time.
but
when
he
arrived,
and
he
was
a
captain,
we
had
nothing
we
could
do
with
him
under
the
bidding
procedures
of
the
contract.
if
you
look
at
ja466
of
the
record,
you
see
a
sample
bid.
in
fact,
you
see
captain
thurston's--
mr.
henry
j.
oechler,
jr.
--oh,
thank
you.
i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
see
that.
