you
say
then
that
if
a
practice
is
justified
under
4(f)(1),
the
fact
that
the
employer
may
treat
employees
of
a
lesser
age
more
leniently
does
not
make
the
practice
that
is
justified
under
4(f)(1)
a
discrimination
because
of
age?
justice
rehnquist
because
you
would
be
treating
people
who
attained
age
60
differently
than
people
who
attained
age
45
in
a
comparable
situation?
justice

but
don't
you
say,
even
if
it
is
comparable,
you
are
protected
by
4(f)(1)?

are
those
really
comparable
situations
when
you
are
talking
about
a
pilot
who
is
35
or
40
years
old,
runs
into
a
completely
unanticipated
medical
difficulty,
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
case
of
a
pilot
who
is
approaching
age
60,
that
is
not
a
sudden
thing
at
all.
that
is
something
that
can
really
be
anticipated
by
everybody
concerned.
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
those
examples
are
always
the
kind
that
proponents
of
the
bill
give,
but
then
congress
enacts
a
general
provision,
and
it
covers
a
lot
more
people
than
just
the
examples.
