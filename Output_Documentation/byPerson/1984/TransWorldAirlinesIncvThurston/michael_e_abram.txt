mr.
michael
e.
abram
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
argument
addressed
by
twa
revolves
around
section
4(a)
of
the
age
discrimination
act,
and
argues
that
there
is
no
substantive
violation
of
that
act.
the
argument
addressed
by
alpa
is
that
even
if
there
were
a
violation
of
4(a)
in
respect
to
the
practices
in
this
case
for
this
handful
of
former
captains,
that
practice
is
protected
by
an
affirmative
defense,
definitional
provision,
however
you
wish
to
characterize
it,
4(f)(1)
of
the
statute.
now,
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
being
less
than
60
years
of
age
is
a
bfoq
for
the
position
of
captain
in
twa
flight
operations.
the
government
has
imposed
that
regulation.
the
question
that
section
4(f)(1)
of
the
adea
addresses
is
simply
what...
well,
there
are
really
two
questions:
first,
how
do
you
go
about
establishing
a
bfoq;
and
secondly,
once
the
bfoq
is
established,
what
action
may
be
taken
in
respect
to
that
fact?
as
i
say,
the
question
as
to
whether
the
bfoq
exists
has
been
answered
in
this
case.
the
only
question
then
is,
what
action
may
be
taken?
now,
section
4(f)(1)
in
plain
terms
says
that
it
is
not
unlawful
under
the
age
discrimination
act
for
an
employer
to
take
any
action,
any
action
otherwise
prohibited
where
age
is
a
bfoq.
now,
that
is
the
kind
of
sweeping
language
that
this
court
has
admonished
time
and
again
is
to
be
read
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
and
indeed,
what
the
eeoc
is
actually
asking
that
this
court
do
is
to
revise
the
section
so
that
where
the
section
says
that
the
employer
may
take
any
action,
it
should
be
read
to
say,
the
employer
may
take
only
one
action.
that
is
the
action
of
simply
removing
the
captain
out
of
that
job,
and
then
the
employer
may
take
any
other
action
which
is
not
prohibited
by
section
4(a),
whereas
4(f)(1)
says
you
may
take
any
action
which
is
prohibited
by
section
4(a).
now,
the
plain
meaning
of
4(f)(1)
is
plainly
buttressed
in
this
case
by
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision.
in
1967,
when
the
adea
was
enacted,
congress
legislated
against
a
background
of
mandatory
retirement
practices,
and
it
prohibited
some
of
those
practices,
but
not
all
of
them.
mr.
michael
e.
abram
your
honor,
that
is
precisely
4(f)--
mr.
michael
e.
abram
--4(f)(1)
addresses
precisely
that
type
of
possibility.
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
defense
to
an
action--
mr.
michael
e.
abram
--if
there
were
age
discrimination,
it
would
be
covered
by
4(a);
4(f)(1)
then
steps
into
place
as
a
defense
to
that
age
discrimination.
it
has
no
role
at
all,
unless
there
is
age
discrimination.
and
in
this
case,
our
argument
assumes
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
that
that
discrimination
exists,
although
we
agree
with
mr.
oechler
on
merit.
mr.
michael
e.
abram
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
e.
abram
that
is
precisely
what...
is
argued.
mr.
michael
e.
abram
well,
they
say
that
by
reason
of
the
age
60
rule,
the
bfoq
rule
which
the
faa
has
imposed,
we
will
mandatorily
retire
you
rather
than
then
permit
you
to
exercise
your--
mr.
michael
e.
abram
--well,
the
reason
for
that
decision
is
one
in
this
instance
which
has
to
be
addressed,
i
think,
to
the
employer,
but
the
question
that
the
association,
the
airline
pilots
association
addresses
is
that
that
decision,
whatever
the
reason,
and
even
if
it
is
because
of
age,
your
honor,
is
protected
by
4(f)(1),
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
and
as
buttressed
by
the
legislative
history.
when
congress
legislated
in
1967,
it
authorized
mandatory
retirement
under
4(f)(2),
and
it
authorized
it
under
4(f)(1).
4(f)(2),
of
course,
the
court
is
aware,
is
the
employee
benefit
plan
and
seniority
system
defense.
now,
4(f)(2)
has
been
changed
by
congress
in
the
1978
amendments,
and
congress
when
it...
of
course,
these
statutory
references
are
at
page
3
and
4
of
the
brief
of
twa.
when
congress
amended
4(f)(2)
in
1978
to
take
away
mandatory
retirement
under
an
employee
benefit
plan,
they
were
faced
with
the
problem
that
some
people
might
argue
that
when
they
did
that,
that
there
could
no
longer
be
mandatory
retirement
at
an
age
which
is
a
bfoq,
that
that
would
no
longer
be
protected
under
4(f)(1).
the
senate
passed
an
amendment
to
4(f)(1),
literally
passed
it.
it
wasn't
a
committee.
it
was
passed
by
the
senate,
and
that
amendment
provided
explicitly
that
the
action
that
could
be
taken
under
4(f)(1)
included
the
action
of
mandatory
retirement,
and
when
that
got
to
the
conference
committee,
because
the
house
did
not
have
that
provision
in
its
legislation,
the
conferees
agreed
that
it
would
not...
that
amendment
would
not
be
in
the
final
bill
because
it
worked
no
change
on
the
present
law.
they
plainly
understood
and
were
expressing
for
all
of
us
to
see
and
read
that
the
present
law
going
back
to
1967
authorized
mandatory
retirement
at
an
age
which
is
a
bfoq.
and
in
the
eeoc
v.
wyoming
case,
which
involved
the
mandatory
retirement
of
the
game
warden
and
the
application
of
the
adea
to
the
states,
one
of
the
concerns
that
this
court
had
was,
well,
what
could
happen
with
this
game
warden
if
he
was
disqualified
by
a
bfoq?
and
the
court
said
in
reliance
on
assurances
of
the
eeoc
that
the
state
of
wyoming
would
be
free
to
do,
as
to
that
game
warden,
precisely
what
they
had
been
doing
and
what
employers
had
been
doing
where
age
is
a
bfoq,
and
that
was
in
that
case
mandatory
retirement.
now,
section
4(f)(1)
is
a
defense
of
general
application,
and
it
doesn't
depend,
unlike
the
analysis
of
the
eeoc,
and
with
due
respect,
the
second
circuit,
it
simply
does
not
depend
on
what
other
practices
the
employer
may
be
engaging
in
with
respect
to
its
employees.
it
doesn't
require
the
employer
to
justify
on
a
case
by
case,
business
by
business,
job
by
job
analysis.
mr.
michael
e.
abram
i
analyze
it
in
terms
of
a
defense
to
what
would
otherwise
be
considered
age
discrimination.
of
course,
in
this
case,
it
must
be
remembered
that
flight
engineers
past
the
age
of
60
have
the
same
rights
under
the
contract
as
those
younger
than
60.
that
is
worth
bearing
in
mind
when
we
look
at
this
particular
set
of
practices.
but
we
would
analyze
it
as
a
defense
to
what
would
otherwise
be
prohibited
by
section
4(a).
mr.
michael
e.
abram
well,
that
depends,
your
honor,
on
whether
it
is
comparable,
and
the
second
circuit
split
two
to
one
on
whether
there
were
apples
and
oranges
here,
and--
mr.
michael
e.
abram
--that's
correct.
absolutely.
mr.
michael
e.
abram
i
think
congress,
pursuant
to
its
authority
to
regulate
commerce,
could
do
so,
just
as
it
has
delegated
that
authority
to
the
federal
aviation
administration,
to
say
that
if
the
faa
chose--
mr.
michael
e.
abram
--that's
correct,
and
the--
mr.
michael
e.
abram
--the
faa
could
have
said
you
can't
be
a
flight
engineer,
and
they
have
not
at
this
point
said
so,
but
they
could
have.
mr.
michael
e.
abram
i
would
think,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional
under
other
provisions.
mr.
michael
e.
abram
no,
your
honor.
all
that
has
happened
is
that
congress
has
authorized
mandatory
retirement
in
a
narrow
range
of
cases
which
this
court
recognized
in
eeoc
v.
wyoming
was
a
very
narrow
range
of
cases
of
the
bfoq
cases.
and
in
those
narrow
cases,
there
would
be
mandatory
retirement
permitted,
and
no
case
by
case
analysis.
now,
in
my
few
remaining
minutes
addressing
briefly
the
question
of
remedies
insofar
as
union
liability
is
concerned,
an
issue
that
was
raised
by
twa
which
seeks
to
shift
some
of
its
liability
in
the
event
there
is
an
affirmance
on
the
substance
of
the
case,
on
the
merits
of
the
4(a)
issue
to
the
airline
pilots
association.
this
is,
of
course,
an
action
for
lost
wages,
that
is
to
say,
amounts
owing.
and
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
clearly
provides,
and
this
court
recognized
in
lorillard
that
amounts
owing
are
to
be
treated
as
unpaid
minimum
wages
and
overtime
compensation
for
purposes
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
i
don't
think
there
is
really
a
serious
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
not
provide
a
remedy
against
a
union
which
violates
those
provisions
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
would
be,
for
example,
a
violation
of
some
provisions
of
the
flsa.
but
just
addressing
it
briefly,
you
have
section
16(b)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
is
clearly
directed
to
employers.
you
have
section
16(c),
which
has
historically
been
interpreted
to
add
to
the
government
only
the
right
to
collect
on
behalf
of
an
individual,
the
individual's
right
under
section
16(b),
and
you
have
section
17
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
has
been
interpreted
to
restrain
the
withholding
of
unpaid
minimum
wages
and
overtime
compensation
from
employers.
now,
against
this
background,
the
government
and
the
plaintiffs
and,
i
believe,
twa
would
like
the
court
to
read
section
7(b)
of
the
age
discrimination
act,
where
it
contains
language
on
equitable
and
legal
relief
to
provide
a
new
remedy
that
is
not
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
even
assuming
that
twa
could
raise
that
issue
because
essentially
it
is
raising
a
claim
for
contribution,
and
the
plaintiffs
and--
mr.
michael
e.
abram
--the
union
prevailed
on
this
question
below.
mr.
michael
e.
abram
they
not
only
didn't
seek
review
of
it,
your
honor,
they
opposed
review
of
it
explicitly,
and
said
that
they
would
intend
to
collect
on
a
joint
and
several
liability.
mr.
michael
e.
abram
twa
raised
their
right
to
shift
damages.
they
may
call
it
union
liability,
but
in
essence
what
right
do
they
have
to
represent
plaintiffs?
they
are
a
defendant.
any
right
that
they
have
is
to
seek--
mr.
michael
e.
abram
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
precisely
the
analysis.
mr.
michael
e.
abram
i
am
arguing,
your
honor,
that
the
court
ought
not
to
hear
it,
but
that
if
it
does
hear
twa's
claim,
it
should
be
rejected
under
northwest
v.
twu
because
it
is
a
claim
for
contribution,
and
i
can
perceive
no
distinction
between
this
statutory
scheme
in
that
sense
and,
of
course,
title
7
and
the
equal
pay
act,
which
was
part
of
the
flsa
that
was
dealt
with
in
the
twu
case.
but
if
the
court
were
to
reach
the
question,
the
argument
that
section
7(b)
or
7(c)
of
the
adea
adds
remedies
to
those
contained
in
the
flsa
and
creates
a
remedy
against
a
union
is
really
another
invitation
to
judicial
legislation,
because
whereas
it
is
true
that
title
7
substantive
prohibitions
are
very
similar
to,
as
this
court
recognized
in
lorillard,
to
the
adea
substantive
provision.
the
remedial
schemes,
the
comprehensive
remedial
scheme
of
adea
and
the
flsa
is
quite
different,
and
while
congress
in
title
7
established
a
monetary
remedy
against
unions,
it
did
not
do
so
in
the
adea.
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
comprehensive
remedial
scheme
our
position
is
simply
to
follow
the
precedents
that
were
laid
out
in
northwest
v.
twu
and
the
ratcliffe
industries
case
and
say
that
the
choices
that
are
to
be
made
as
to
the
remedies,
the
policies,
the
policy
choices,
what
would
best
further
the
enforcement
of
this
act
are
choices
that
are
to
be
made
by
congress,
and
they
have
been
made
in
this
instance
by
not
providing
that
remedy.
thank
you.
