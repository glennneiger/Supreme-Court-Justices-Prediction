mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
three
separate
categories
of
issues
to
be
determined
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
there
was
a
violation
in
this
case
which
would
automatically
give
rise
to
a
remedy
for
back
pay.
the
second
is
whether
the
liquidated
damages
provision
which
doubles
the
award
of
back
pay
should
apply,
and
that
is
the
only
question
with
respect
to
which
the
statutory
limitation
to
willful
violations
comes
into
the
case.
and
the
third
question
is
whether
the
union
shares
liability
for
monetary
relief
with
the
employer,
and
whether
that
question
is
properly
before
the
court.
addressing
the
question
of
a
violation
first,
we
readily
agree
that
nothing
in
the
act
would
require
twa
to
make
any
arrangements
to
transfer
captains
or
copilots
to
other
jobs
at
the
time
that
they
are
required
to
leave
those
positions
if
such
transfer
arrangements
aren't
made
for
other
employees.
this
is
strictly
a
disparate
treatment
case
in
comparing
the
way
these
older
employees
are
treated
with
the
way
younger
employees
are
treated.
now,
what
we
have
been
told
by
twa
is
that
these
pilots
upon
reaching
age
60
are
no
longer
pilots
in
command,
and
therefore
cannot
qualify
for
any
transfer
rights.
there
are
two
points
to
be
made.
the
first
is,
all
of
the
plaintiffs
before
the
court
requested
transfers
prior
to
reaching
their
60th
birthday,
when
they
were
pilots
in
command.
those
who
were
unsuccessful
in
obtaining
the
transfers
were
unsuccessful
because
the
process
could
not
be
completed
prior
to
reaching
their
60th
birthday.
we
discuss
in
footnote
9
in
our
brief
one
exceptional
case
where
through
correspondence
with
the
employer
one
of
the
eeoc
plaintiffs
was,
he
says,
misled
into
not
actually
submitting
his
bid
until
after
his
60th
birthday.
but
the
basic
point...
it
is
the
second
point...
is
that
in
comparing
their
situation
with
those
of
younger
pilots
exercising
transfer
requests,
the
younger
pilots
who
flunk
their
medical
examination
for
a
first
class
medical
certificate
and
then
request
a
transfer,
or
who
are
disciplined
for
misconduct
in
their
job
as
captains
or
as
copilots
are
no
longer
pilots
in
command
when
they
make
their
request
for
a
transfer.
so,
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
plaintiffs
here
and
the
younger
pilots
whose
treatment
they
are
being
compared
to
on
the
basis
of
whether
they
are
pilots
in
command
at
the
time
the
transfer
requests
are
afforded.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
it
was
anticipated
by
making
a
request
for
a
transfer
prior
to
reaching
age
60.
those
requests
were
not
honored
if
the
actual
transfer
to
a
different
position
wasn't
completed
before
that
pilot
reached
age
60.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
that
is
the
argument
made
with
respect
to
a
reading
of
that
phrase
at
the
beginning
of
that
section.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
attempted
to
deal
with
it,
and
let
me
deal
with
it
now,
justice
o'connor.
our
understanding
of
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
requirement
is
that
it
applies
to
the
particular
occupation
for
which
it
is
a
legitimate
requirement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
we
agree
with
that,
that
there
is
no
necessity
to
make
special
arrangements
for
a
mandatorily
retired
employee.
that
is
why
we
took
the
position
we
did
in
eeoc
against
wyoming.
the
difference
here
is
that,
as
in
hishon
against
spaulding,
the
employer
is
affording
certain
privileges
as
an
incident
of
employment
and
certain
contractual
rights
as
an
incident
of
employment,
and
wants
to
extend
them
only
to
one
category
of
employees,
in
that
case
based
on
sex
and
in
this
case
based
on
age.
and
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
congress
addressed.
the
fact
that
it
is...
that
the
faa
regulation
says
they
no
longer
can
serve
in
this
particular
job
because
of
their
age,
that
is
a
bfoq
with
respect
to
that
job,
but
all
it
means
with
respect
to
their
transfer
request
is
that
the
reason
they
are
making
the
request
is
because
of
their
age--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
o'connor.
it
is
the
kind
of
argument
that
is
similar
to
arguments
that
were
made
against
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
altogether,
that
it
was
going
to
deprive
younger
workers
of
opportunities
to
move
up
and
to
transfer
to
other
positions,
and
congress
resolved
that
policy
question
the
other
way,
and
when
congress
thought
the
courts
and
particularly
this
court
had
gone
too
far
in
permitting
mandatory
retirements
as
part
of
a
seniority
system,
they
amended
the
act
to
say
that
mandatory
retirements
could
not
be
a
part
of
this
defense
based
on
a
seniority
system.
they
were
concerned
that
people
who
still
wanted
to
be
a
productive
part
of
the
work
force
not
be
discriminated
against
because
of
their
age,
and
they
recognized
that
this
might
delay
advancement
of
other
people
or
cause
other
people
not
to
have
job
opportunities
that
would
otherwise
be
there.
and
that
is
part
of
what
we
are
faced
with
here.
now,
let
me
just
try
to
respond
further
to
your
question
with
a
hypothetical,
which
i
don't
think
is
unrealistic
since
we
have
the
age
discrimination
act
which
allows
persons
to
enter
the
work
force
at
an
advanced
age.
supposing
you
had
someone
who
became
a
pilot
at
age
59
for
the
first
time
and
had
to
give
up
his
job
at
age
60
and
just
severed
his
relations
with
the
company
because
he
didn't
have
enough
seniority
to
make
a
bid.
similarly,
another
worker
became
a
pilot
at
age
35,
and
at
age
36
for
disciplinary
reasons
or
medical
reasons
he
was
removed
from
that
job,
he
similarly
severed
his
relations
with
the
company.
then
the
company
expands
operations
and
is
hiring
flight
engineers
a
year
later,
and
they
both
apply
for
the
job.
it
is
obvious
and
in
fact
it
is
conceded
in
the
reply
brief
on
the
other
side
that
the
company
could
not
discriminate
between
these
two
applicants
for
the
flight
engineer's
job
based
on
their
age.
why
should
a
different
principal
prevail
based
on
whether
in
transferring
to
the
job
in
the
first
place
they
can
carry
over
their
seniority
rights
or
not
when
they
are
seeking
the
job
because
they
no
longer
can
perform
the
other
job
they
have?
it
isn't
a
sensible
interpretation
of
a
defense,
a
bfoq
defense
that
was
tied
to
the
idea
that
the
employer
need
not
hire
persons
for
the
particular
occupation
for
which
the
bfoq
defense
applies.
on
the
liability
question,
we
really
don't
think
there
is
a
material
difference
between
this
case
and
hishon
against
king
and
spaulding.
the
statutory
context
is
different,
but
there
is
no
material
difference.
we
are
dealing
with
privileges
and
contract
rights
that
are
afforded
as
an
incident
of
employment,
and
indeed
this
case
really
follows
a
fortiori
from
the
hishon
case
because
the
job
to
which
they
are
seeking
to
be
transferred
is
itself
an
employee
position,
whereas
in
hishon
the
court
assumed
that
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
was
not
present,
but
i
think
the
hypothetical
that
i
just
discussed
really
answers
it.
they
are
not
saying
that
because
this
older
employee
severed
his
ties
with
the
company
because
of
a
bfoq,
he
can
now
be
denied
equal
consideration
as
an
outsider
to
the
flight
engineer
job.
i
don't
see
why
there
is
anything
in
the
statute
that
should
require
the
opposite
result
with
respect
to
his
effort
to
transfer
and
to
use
his
accumulated
seniority
for
the
same
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
one
of
the
two
applicants--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--one
of
the
two
applicants
had
been
subject
to
the
bfoq
for
the
captain
job.
he
had
been
severed
from
the
company
for
that
reason.
if
he
had
not
been,
he
wouldn't
be
applying
now
for
the
flight
engineer
job.
the
difference
is
in
whether
he
can
be
discriminated
against
differently
because
he
before
he
is
severed
is
trying
to
use
his
seniority
rights
to
apply
for
the
same
job,
and
the
statute--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
agree
with
that
completely.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
language
is,
like
so
many
other
things
in
this
statute,
as
the
court
recognized
in
lorillard
against
pons,
the
statute
was
a
hybrid
of
approaches,
and
they
spliced
together
approaches
from
various
statutes,
and
the
bfoq
approach
was
taken
from
title
7.
in
title
7,
if
you
have
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
that
you
have
to
be
a
particular
sex
for
a
particular
job,
you
never
serve
in
that
job
at
all,
and
this
question
of
transfer
rights
doesn't
arise,
and
there
wasn't
the
kind
of
precise
focus
on
the
drafting
of
the
provision
that
might
have
occurred
if
they
had
focused
on
this
difference
between
the
two
statutes
when
they
were
borrowing
the
provision
from
the
other.
but
there
are
indications
that
we
cite
and
refer
to
in
our
committee
reports
that
they
thought
of
the
bfoq
as
being
limited
to
particular
occupations,
and
the
whole
thrust
of
the
statute
was
to
oppose
the
mandatory
retirement
or
other
discriminations
that
would
prevent
older
workers
from
continuing
to
be
a
productive
part
of
the
work
force
if
they
chose
to
be.
and
i
think
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
in
light
of
that
purpose.
the
words
certainly
lend
themselves
to
it,
as
we
explained
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.
now,
i
would
like
to,
unless
there
are
further
questions
on
that
liability
issue,
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
liquidated
damages
provision,
and
the
proper
statutory
standard
for
determining
what
constitutes
a
willful
violation
within
the
context
of
this
civil
provision.
and
i
think
in
connection
with
this
question,
but
it
also
relates
to
the
other
one
as
well,
perhaps
the
most
misleading
thing
about
this
case
and
the
danger
of
this
case
in
interpreting
the
pertinent
statutory
terms
is
that
the
facts
here
are
so
very
far
from
the
typical
case
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
enacted
the
liquidated
damages
provision
initially
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
or
when
they
carried
it
over
into
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act.
they
were
not
thinking
of
relatively
well
to
do
employees
such
as
these
pilots
who
already
qualify
for
comfortable
pensions.
what
they
were
thinking
about
initially
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
were
people
who
weren't
even
getting
the
minimum
wage,
and
perhaps
in
a
period
of
high
unemployment
had
previously
been
unemployed,
and
that
if
they
were
denied
the
minimum
wage,
it
could
cause
great
hardships
that
were
very
hard
to
measure.
they
might
miss
installment
payments
or
rent
payments
and
have
to
move
in
with
relatives,
or
miss
their
insurance
payments.
they
might
have
to
choose
between
forfeiting
various
of
these
things,
and
they
said,
all
of
this
is
obscure
and
hard
to
measure,
and
the
only
way
to
make
them
whole,
to
compensate
them,
is
to
have
this
liquidated
damages
provision,
which
was
considered
a
compensatory
way
of
making
them
whole.
now,
in
enacting
the
adea
and
carrying
this
provision
over,
again
congress
was
thinking
of
workers
who
would
be
hard
pressed
in
their
personal
situations
by
violation.
when
secretary
willard
wertz,
the
secretary
of
labor,
testified
in
support
of
the
bill
in
the
hearings,
the
particular
example
that
he
gave
in
some
detail
was
of
a
51-year-old
factory
worker
who
had
been
forced
to
drop
out
of
high
school
many
years
earlier
and
worked
at
odd
jobs,
and
finally
worked
himself
up
into
a
position
in
a
factory,
and
then
the
factory
closed,
and
he
found
himself
in
a
position
of
having
to
apply
for
other
jobs,
saying
that
his
education
was
less
than
high
school
education
and
he
was
51
years
old
and
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
it.
and
then
he
cited--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
right,
but
my
point
is
that
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
statutory
terms
are
going
to
cover
a
lot
more
people
than
just
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
and
that
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
examples
that
were
foremost
in
the
congressional
mind
in
enacting
these
provisions.
and
if
i
may
just
finish
this
point,
what
the
secretary
cited
to
congress
was
that
over
a
third
of
all
men
who
have
been
unemployed
27
weeks
or
more,
this
overall
hard
core
unemployed,
are
over
45,
although
this
group
makes
up
slightly
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
work
force.
the
percentage
of
older
workers
in
this
hard
core
category
was
34.3
percent
last
year,
up
from
30.2
percent
in
'65.
more
than
half
of
the
nation's
poor
families
are
headed
by
persons
45
or
over,
more
than
a
third
by
persons
55
or
over.
and
it
was
in
light
of
testimony
of
this
sort
and
discussions
of
this
sort
that
the
conference
report
referred
to
the
liquidated
damages
provision
as
compensatory
in
nature
rather
than
a
penalty
on
the
employer,
and
quoted
from
this
court's
decision
in
overnight
transportation
company
against
missel,
which
described
this
as
the
purpose
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act's
liquidated
damages
provision.
and
it
is
against
this
background
that
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
standard
we
have
urged.
we
don't
think
that
congress
in
enacting
these
provisions
had
in
mind
that
an
employer
who
chose
to
make
a
legal
argument
when
he
knew
the
act
applied
but
thought
he
might
have
a
legal
argument
that
would
prevail,
we
think
the
intent
of
congress
was
clear
that
in
that
situation,
if
the
employer
is
wrong
in
his
legal
argument,
it
is
the
employer
rather
than
the
employee
who
should
bear
the
loss,
and
the
employee
should
be
fully
compensated.
and
that
is
the
way
the
comparable
limitations
provision
on
which
this
was
based
has
also
been
interpreted.
my
time
has
expired.
