mr.
raymond
c.
fay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
not
a
case
about
what
type
of
accommodation
should
be
given
to
workers
of
any
age.
it
is
a
case
about
whether
pilots
approaching
age
60
who
wish
to
transfer
to
the
flight
engineer
position
are
treated
less
favorably
because
of
their
age.
the
appropriate
universe
of
pilots
here
to
consider
is
all
of
those
pilots
who
lose
their
qualifications
for
whatever
reason
and
need
or
want
to
transfer
to
the
flight
engineer
position.
this,
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
a
summary
judgment
case.
there
is
no
dispute
that
all,
every
single
one
of
the
younger
pilots
who
had
sufficient
seniority
to
transfer
were
allowed
to
transfer
to
the
flight
engineer
position.
only
the
60-year-olds
were
not
allowed
to
in
some
instances.
there
were
some
questions
from
the
bench
about
bids.
it
should
be
understood
that
pilots
on
twa,
like
all
airlines,
move
around
from
one
position
to
the
other,
up,
down,
by
mechanisms
other
than
bids.
twa
states
that
bidding
is
the
basic
mechanism
in
its
contract
for
openings,
but
that
is
a
term
of
art.
that
bidding
applies
when
the
airline
is
expanding
its
operations
and
there
are
new
openings,
usually
for
people
to
move
up
the
ladder.
in
the
same
section
of
twa's
contract
which
governs
the
movement
of
pilots,
it
shows
that
pilots
also
move
by
other
means,
displacements,
or
bumps,
as
they
are
called,
and
assignments,
and
with
respect
to
the
questions
regarding
automatic
downbidding
rights
of
those
other
people
who
are
disqualified
from
their
pilot
positions,
such
as
the
medically
disqualified,
or
the
disciplinary
downgrades,
those
people
don't
submit
bids
in
all
instances.
in
some
cases
when
a
pilot
goes
off
of
the
active
work
force
because
of
medical
disability,
although
that
initial
medical
disability
is
unanticipated,
that
pilot
will
go
through
a
long
process
of
regaining
his
medical
qualifications,
and
he
will
make
an
active
decision
once
he
gets
recertified
when
to
come
back
to
work.
now,
under
the
pilot
contract
he
either
may
submit
a
bid
or
he
may
displace
a
pilot
with
less
seniority.
now,
those
pilots
are
allowed
to
use
their
seniority
rights
to
displace
a
less
senior
pilot.
a
better
example
is
the
disciplinary
downgrades
which
twa's
head
of
manpower
planning
testified
had
occurred
in
many
instances
over
many
years.
that
doesn't
involve
a
contractual
provision
at
all.
there
is
nothing
in
that
contract
that
twa
has
with
its
pilots
that
talks
about
disciplinary
downgrades.
the
company
simply
says,
we
are
going
to
punish
you
because
you
made
a
mistake
as
captain,
and
you
are
going
to
go
back
to
co-pilot
for
two
months,
or
you
are
going
to
go
back
to
flight
engineer
for
two
years,
or,
in
the
instance
that
is
in
the
record
here,
you
are
going
to
go
back
to
flight
engineer
permanently.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it
is--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--yes,
it
is
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure,
your
honor,
but
we
are
talking
about
whether
bidding
is
the
appropriate
universe
here.
bidding
is
not
the
appropriate
universe,
because
pilots
may
move
around
by
other
means.
with
regard
to
the
bfoq
argument
that
alpa
makes,
the
legislative
history,
the
1978
legislative
history
in
particular,
is
clear
that
all
congress
was
talking
about
in
4(f)(1)
is
the
particular
job
in
question.
the
bfoq,
if
it
is
sought
to
be
asserted
for
a
position
not
involving
a
transfer,
then
perhaps
the
bfoq
exception
would
apply.
but
reading
the
legislative
history
as
a
whole,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
had
the
transfer
question
on
its
mind,
but
similarly,
there
is
no
question
that
the
issue
of
transfer
is
one
that
is
covered
by
the
age
act,
because
the
age
act
in
section
4(a)(1)
not
only
talks
about
hiring
and
firing,
but
in
section
4(a)(2)
it
also
talks
about
anything
that
would
tend
to
deprive
a
person
of
employment
opportunities,
the
conditions,
the
terms,
and
the
privileges
of
employment.
now,
so
that
we
have
a
complete
view
of
the
record,
i
would
like
to
bring
the
case
back
for
a
minute
to
where
it
began
in
1978.
in
1978,
when
twa
refused
the
transfer
requests
of
captain
thurston
and
three
of
the
eeoc
claimants,
and
required
them
to
retire
in
that
year,
it
didn't
have
any
captains
employed
in
the
flight
engineer
position
beyond
age
60.
twa
talks
about
the
60
people
who
later
transferred
from
captain
to
flight
engineer.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
because
when
captain
thurston
asked
to
transfer
to
flight
engineer,
the
response
he
got
from
the
company
was
not
that
he
didn't
have
a
bid
on
file,
but
that
he
was
about
to
reach
the
mandatory
retirement
age
that
had
been
agreed
to
by
the
union
and
the
company.
so,
there
was
a...
that
stark
difference
in
treatment
because
of
age
is
plainly...
is
plain
to
see.
it
was
not
because
he
didn't
have
a
bid,
or
hadn't
submitted
the
appropriate
papers
for
transfer.
it
was
solely
because
of
his
age.
now,
that
practice
did
change
a
little
bit
later,
but
twa
makes
it
sound
like
nothing
began
until
it
announced
that
it
was
going
to
employ
people
past
60.
the
majority
of
the
remaining
plaintiffs
and
the
eeoc
claimants
in
this
case
turned
60
and
were
required
to
retire
long
before
twa
actually
employed
any
captains
in
that
flight
engineer
position
beyond
age
60.
now,
for
those
later
eeoc
claimants,
it
was
not
a
total
brick
wall,
but
the
difference
in
treatment
was
still
the
same.
it
was
based
on
age,
because
all
the
pilots
who
were
younger
and
60
and
wished
to
transfer,
if
they
had
sufficient
seniority,
they
could
do
so.
the
age
60
people
were
not
allowed
to
do
so.
now,
with
regard
to
the
seniority
question,
maybe
one
other
clarifying
point.
the
flight
engineer
job
is
a
different
job.
it
is
not
covered
by
the
faa's
age
60
rule,
which
precludes
captains
and
first
officers
from
flying
beyond
age
60.
however,
there
is
a
single
integrated
seniority
list
on
twa,
and
the
general
seniority
provision
on
twa
says
that
the
senior
person
gets
the
preference,
and
with
that
ingrained
part
of
the
seniority
system,
it
is
easy
to
see
why
the
second
circuit
concluded
that
the
plaintiffs
here
were
not
challenging
the
seniority
system.
indeed,
they
were
trying
to
use
their
seniority
under
twa's
system
and
under
the
law
to
obtain
the
flight
engineer
position.
judge
van
grafelin
in
his
dissent
had
it
backwards.
captain
thurston
and
the
others
were
not
trying
to
take
a
nine-year
furlough
or
even
a
one-day
furlough
and
get
back
into
the
system.
they
were
seeking
to
assert
their
rights
as
pilots,
senior
pilots,
to
transfer
to
the
flight
engineer
position
before
age
60.
so,
the
aipa
question
of
whether
a
bfoq
applies
does
not
even
come
up
for
those
people,
because
they
sought
to
use
their
existing
seniority
to
transfer.
finally,
the
faa's
age
60
rule,
of
course,
does
not
speak
to
employment
as
such
at
all.
it
only
covers
service
as
a
pilot,
and
does
not
tell
twa
how
to
run
its
employment
business.
so,
the
fact
that
the
faa's
age
60
rule
precluding
service
as
a
pilot
applies
does
not
preclude
service
from
a
flight
engineer
on
twa.
unless
there
are
questions,
i
will
conclude
my
argument.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
our
position
is
the
same
as
the
eeoc.
it
is
not...
in
our
briefs
we
show
that
there
is
no
difference
under
the
statute
for
saying
that
willful
means
anything
different
than
it
means
in--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--that
issue
definitely
is
here,
and
i
might
add,
your
honor,
that
we
supported
twa--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--that's
right.
we
supported
twa
on
that
issue--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--in
our
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
so
we
believe
the
case
is
indistinguishable
from
the
perini,
north
river
parks
associates
case
which
eeoc
has
cited
in
its
reply
brief.
thank
you.
