justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
wallace,
what
about
the
effect
of
section
4(f)(1),
which
appears
expressly
to
permit
an
employer
to
take
any
action
otherwise
prohibited
by
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
for
a
person
who
is
retired
pursuant
to
a
bfoq?
justice
o'connor
well,
doesn't
the
literal
language
certainly
make
it
look
like
that
argument
has
to
be
dealt
with?
justice
o'connor
doesn't
the
legislative
history
indicate
that
if
there
is
a
bfoq,
the
employer
was
not
intended
to
have
to
find
some
other
job
for
the
mandatorily
retired
employee?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
eeoc
position
were
to
prevail,
wouldn't
it
have
the
effect
in
general
of
discouraging
employers
from
offering
any
benefits
to
anybody?
wouldn't
it
serve
to
discourage
any
other
employer
from
ever
affording
any
kind
of
opportunity
to
downgrade
or
have
another
break,
because
they
are
going
to
be
hit
with
this
kind
of
a
charge?
justice
o'connor
do
we
have
a
statutory
provision
equivalent
exactly
to
4(f)(1)?
