i
suppose
if
the
basis
for
the
ruling
was
you
were
discriminating,
i
suppose
you
could
have
eliminated
the
discrimination
the
other
way
by
just
not
allowing
any
automatic
transfers.
justice
white
automatic?
justice
white
well,
automatic--
justice
white
--well,
you
have
some
automatic
downbidding.
justice
white
was
that
required
by
the
contract?
justice
white
i
suppose
you
could
have
negotiated
yourself
out
of
that.
if
those
automatic
downbiddings
were
eliminated,
you
wouldn't...
this
case
wouldn't
be
here,
would
it?
justice
white
what
is
your
legal
position
under
the
contract
if
you
have
to
give
automatic
downbidding
to
pilots
becoming
60?
are
you--
justice
white
--or
forbids
it?
justice
white
would
you
have
to...
is
it--
justice
white
--i
understand.
justice
white
he
is
no
longer
anything.
justice
white
what
if
a
month
before
he
got
to
be
60
you
let
him
downbid?
justice
white
as
flight
engineers.
justice
white
i
take
it
you
would
be
urging
the
same
position
if
in
express
language
the
contract
said
that
pilots
who
become
disqualified
by
reasons
of
health
or
some
other
reasons
from
remaining
as
a
captain
may
downbid,
but
pilots
who
become
disqualified
by
reason
of
age
may
not.
justice
white
if
that...
if
in
so
many
words,
you
would
still
take
the
same
position?
justice
white
even
though
it
is
another
brand
of
age
discrimination?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
there
are
two
different
kinds
of
age
discrimination.
justice
white
aren't
we
talking
about
two
different
kinds
of
age
discrimination?
they
certainly
can
claim
that
they
may
discharge
a
pilot,
discharge
a
man
from
a
pilot's
position
at
age
60
and
not
be
guilty
of
age
discrimination.
justice
white
but
then
they
say
also
by
reason
of
your
age
we
won't
give
you
the
same
privileges
as
other
pilots
who
become
disqualified.
justice
white
and
the
reason
we
are
doing
it
is
because
of
your
age.
justice
white
--could
i
ask
you,
what
about
the
willfulness
issue?
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
white
that
issue
is
here,
isn't
it?
justice
white
i
guess
we
wouldn't
need
to
decide
it
if
we
decided
there
was
no
liability.
justice
white
right.
