mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
this
case,
as
it
gets
further
along,
tends
to
get
more
and
more
blown
out
of
proportion.
the
case
that
we
originally
dealt
with
at
the
district
court
level
and
the
reason
that
the
state
court
transcript
is
before
you
and
was
before
the
district
judge
was
to
demonstrate,
in
response
to
one
of
your
questions,
what
did
the
officer
mean
by
"take
off".
if
you
read
officer
eger's
testimony
on
page
40
of
the
joint
appendix,
his
testimony
was
at
that
point
in
time
he
said
hello
to
mr.
hensley,
told
him
he
was
obstructing
traffic,
and
told
him
to
move
along.
and
he
then
got
on
the
radio
and
made
an
inquiry
as
to
a
flyer.
now,
it
should
be
noted
that
then
other
officers
began
their
conversations
concerning
this,
and
the
despatcher
said
there
is
no
flyer.
so
you
have
to
again
look
back
at
their
testimony,
and
their
testimony
was
that
they
didn't
recall
whether
it
had
been
two
months
that
they
had
heard
it,
two
weeks
that
they
had
heard
it,
or
the
day
before.
it
becomes
even
more
prevalent
when
you
notice
that
the
despatcher
hooked
into
the
watch
commander
and
the
watch
commander
said:
there's
no
warrant,
there's
no
flyer.
they
checked
into
cincinnati:
no
flyer,
no
warrant.
the
situation
becomes
even
more
blown
out
of
proportion.
they
talk
as
if
only
officer
coke
stopped
the
individual.
there
were
four
cruisers
that
stopped
in
moments.
mr.
hensley's
whereabouts
was
known.
they
gave
two
locations
over
the
radio.
one
was
his
home,
the
other
one
was
his
sister's
home.
he
didn't
even
illegally
park
when
he
was
pulled
over.
they
say
limited
intrusion--
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
--no,
i
would
not
concede
that.
there
was
absolutely
no
basis.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
and
he
would
have
the
freedom
to
leave.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
but
we're
not
dealing
with
that
particular
case.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
no,
i
don't
believe
they
can,
because
you
have
to
permit
the
defendant
to
leave.
and
in
the
dunnaway
case...
that's
what
you're
asking
in
effect
for
me
to
discuss...
are
they
permitted
to
stop
an
individual,
question
him
concerning
ongoing
criminal
investigation?
do
they
have
to
advise
that
he's
free
to
leave?
do
they
not
advise
him
that
he's
free
to
leave?
you're
asking
whether
the
st.
bernard
police--
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
--well,
that's
correct,
and
if
you
look
at
the
stop,
would
the
st.
bernard
police
have
stopped
him
in
the
same
manner
that
the
covington
police
did?
guns
drawn,
four
cruisers,
get
your
hands
on
the
hood,
slide
all
the
way
to
the
rear
of
the
car,
place
your
hands
on
the
rear
bumper
or
the
rear
hood
of
your
vehicle,
wait
for
the
other
cruisers
to
show
up,
then
get
you
up
on
the
sidewalk.
this
didn't
take
a
few
moments.
other
officers
then
proceeded
to
leave.
the
man
was
at
gunpoint.
while
he
was
being
questioned
on
the
sidewalk,
another
officer
decided
to
search
through
his
vehicle.
you
know,
so
is
that
what
you
would
want
the
st.
bernard
police
to
be
able
to
do?
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
read
the
transcript,
the
transcript
was
that's
how
long
it
took
the
officers
to
get
there,
not
necessarily
how
long
it
took
all
of
this
to
transpire.
all
the
cruisers
began
to
converge
on
mr.
hensley,
who
had
not
committed
any
type
of
offense.
they
were
relying
solely
on
a
flyer
which
didn't
say
we
want
to
question
him,
covington
police
question
him.
it
asked--
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
--it
also
said
pick
him
up
and
hold
him.
and
mr....
excuse
me...
officer
coke's
testimony
in
the
original
hearing
was
he
was
going
to
be
held
for
investigation.
he
didn't
say
he
was
going
to
let
him
go.
page
15
of
your
joint
appendix.
it
said
he
was
going
to
be
held
for
investigation.
this
idea
of,
well,
i
was
only
going
to
stop
him
momentarily,
came
up
later,
once
it
had
been
shifted
from
the
state
system
to
the
federal
system.
the
situation
you
have
to
look
at,
what
did
the
officer
in
cincinnati,
being
st.
bernard,
which
has
been
intermingled...
st.
bernard
is
a
suburb
of
cincinnati...
what
was
his
request?
his
request
was
to
have
the
man
arrested.
that
was
his
testimony.
he
wanted
the
man
arrested
so
he
could
come
over
and
talk
to
him.
now,
how
long
is
a
reasonable
period
of
time?
there
was
no
warrant
issued
for
five
months.
the
man
was
never
charged.
he
was
never
actually
indicted
for
this
alleged
robbery
that
took
place
in
st.
bernard.
as
we
see
it,
there's
no
question.
this
was
not
an
investigatory
stop.
it
was
an
arrest.
the
purpose
was
to
arrest
him,
to
detain
him,
take
him
back
to
the
station
until
st.
bernard
could
come
down
and
talk
to
him.
the
reason
the
warrant
was
issued
in
may
was
because
that's
when
the
officers
from
st.
bernard
finally
decided
to
come
down
and
talk
to
him.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
that
was
the
testimony
that
officer
coke
elicited
before
the
district
judge.
but
the
testimony
was
also,
as
appears
in
the
transcript
and
was
submitted
to
the
district
judge
and
was
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals,
was
that
was
not
what
happened.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
that
is
right,
and
our
position
is
that,
though
their
wording
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
actual
findings
as
i
would
see
them,
their
finding
is
correct.
the
officers
had
elicited
an
illegal
act
by
the
covington
police
department.
there
were
no
specific,
there
were
no
articulable
facts
upon
which
to
base
their
finding.
mr.
hensley
had
done
nothing
wrong.
if
you
take
the
step
and
see
what
the
flyer
initiated,
the
flyer,
as
it
was
testified
to,
was
based
on
an
affidavit
of
an
individual
that
it's
bantered
back
and
forth
whether
she
was
or
was
not
actually
involved.
it
was
our
position
at
the
district
court,
it
was
our
position
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
our
position
here,
that
woman
was
not
involved;
she
was
just
relating
what
someone
had
told
her.
the
st.
bernard
police
relied
on
that
information,
relied
on
an
affidavit
which
doesn't
even
mention
my
client's
name.
it
never
did.
it
relates
to
a
man
named
tommy.
now,
i
think
the
difficulty
is,
if
you're
going
to
have
flyers
issued
and
when
the
officer
says
in
his
own
testimony,
i
did
not
personally
believe
i
had
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant,
if
there's
a
judge
involved
then
i
think
it
can
be
made
proper.
but
when
the
police
determine
for
themselves
what
is
going
to
be
probable
cause
solely
for
the
purposes
of
investigation
and
solely
for
the
purposes
of
arrest,
then
you're
getting
a
situation
that
is
tantamount
to
causing
the
police
to
have
unbridled
power
to
pick
up
anyone
they
so
choose.
in
this
particular
case,
you've
got
a
situation
where,
if
the
officer
from
st.
bernard
had
taken
the
information
he
had
to
a
magistrate
or
a
district
judge
and
requested
a
warrant
and
that
warrant
was
issued,
then
i
don't
think
we
would
be
here
because
i
wouldn't
have
really
any
argument
to
try
and
second
guess
what
was
submitted
and
what
is
or
is
not
probable
cause
to
the
judge.
but
when
the
district
court
makes
that
determination,
after
the
defendant's
been
arrested,
after
everything's
been
complete,
he
looks
back
and
says,
well,
i
disagree
with
the
officer
in
st.
bernard,
i
think
there
was
probable
cause,
i
don't
think
he
can
do
that.
this
is
closing
the
gate
after
the
barn
door...
the
horse
has
gotten
out
of
the
barn.
what
we
have
is
a
situation
that,
if
you're
going
to
balance
the
tests,
then
the
officers'
in
covington
sole
knowledge
is
that
what
they
receive
from
st.
bernard.
it
was
a
flyer,
a
flyer
which
requested
an
illegal
act,
because
it
didn't
ask
them
to
question
him;
it
asked
them
to
hold
him.
it
didn't
ask
them
to
do--
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
--i
believe
if
a
warrant
had
been
issued
for
the
man's
arrest,
the
covington
police
have
no
option
but
to
arrest
that
person
based
upon
that
warrant.
but
that
was
not
what
they
did
here.
they
didn't
go
get
a
warrant.
they
simply
decided
for
themselves,
and
that's
what
the
officer
testified
to:
i
don't
think
i
had
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant,
so
i
issued
a
probable
cause
flyer.
but
the
probable
cause
flyer
requested
the
man
to
be
arrested.
it
also
elicited
information
that
the
man
was
armed
and
dangerous,
which
could
have
resulted
in
the
death
of
the
individual.
the
situation
that
you
have
to
relate
is
the
proverbial
balancing
test:
the
individual's
limited
intrusion
against
the
balancing
of
the
enforcement
of
the
law.
the
difficulty
is,
what
the
government
is
asking
you
to
do
is
saying
that
an
individual
may
be
stopped,
whether
it's
concerning
investigating
his
activity
at
that
moment,
ongoing
criminal
investigation
of
a
situation
where
they
receive
within
moments
or
within
an
hour
or
so
of
a
crime
having
been
committed
a
description
of
a
vehicle
and
a
description
of
an
individual
and
they
stop
the
person
based
upon
that.
this
is
weeks
after
an
alleged
robbery
took
place,
based
upon
in
effect
hearsay
information,
they
are
asking
that
the
man
be
stopped
and
arrested.
i
do
not
think
that's
what
terry
warrants.
i
do
not
think
that
they
can
permit
that
type
of
conduct,
because
what
it
is
in
effect
doing
is
permitting
the
officers
to
stop
and
harass
any
person
that
they
know
to
be
a
criminal,
simply
because
they
want
to
stop
him.
they
do
whatever
they
want.
you
know,
what
we've
got
here
is
a
situation
that
mr.
hensley,
having
done
nothing
wrong,
was
solely
being
stopped
to
be
questioned
about
some
activity
two
to
three
weeks
before.
the
evidence
that
was
elicited
at
trial
and
through
the
testimony
and
through
the
transcripts
was
that
the
officers
knew:
number
one,
there
was
no
flyer
within
their
department
any
longer;
second,
that
there
was
no
warrant
within
their
department.
now,
does
that
cause
an
officer
on
the
street
to
presume
therefore
there
is
no
warrant?
well,
the
government's
position:
we
need
further
information.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
to
be
exact,
justice
marshall,
it
took
nine
months
to
find
that
flyer.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
no,
that
is
not
correct,
justice
marshall.
they
knew
before
they
ever
stopped
mr.
hensley:
number
one,
that
their
department
did
not
have
a
flyer;
number
two,
that
their
department
had
no
warrant.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
st.
bernard
knew--
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
--maybe
i'm
confused
by
your
question.
st.
bernard
never
asked
for
a
warrant
until
five
months
after
mr.
hensley
was
stopped.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
no,
five
months
after
he
was
stopped,
they
got
a
warrant.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
i
need
to
know
which
department.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
are
you
asking
about
covington?
covington
is
the
department
that
stopped
him.
is
that
the
department
that
you're
asking
about?
if
that
is
the
department,
they
knew
before
they
ever
stopped
him
there
was
no
warrant.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
that
is
correct,
and
it
was
an
ongoing
situation.
it
was
not
something
they
stopped
him,
then
tried
to
verify.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
that
is
correct,
through
the
despatcher.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
that's
how
i
see
it.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
the
officers
first
called
in
to
the
despatcher.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
and
maybe
here
is
where--
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
--it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
"verify".
if
you
mean
the
dispatcher
tells
the
officer
on
the
street
there
is
no
flyer,
there
is
no
warrant.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
apparently
not,
because
as
i
see
it--
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
--no,
no.
what
i
see,
justice
marshall,
is
that
the
officers
attempted
to
verify
when
they
called
in
to
the
despatcher,
and
when
they
called
the
despatcher
there
was
no
verification
there
available
to
them
as
to
a
flyer
or
a
warrant.
now,
after
they
stopped
mr.
hensley,
of
course,
they
then
went
on
to
try
and
verify
the
existence
of
a
flyer
and
the
existence
of
a
warrant.
they
did
it
at
both
times.
it
depends
on
whether
you
mean
did
they
communicate
with
st.
bernard
prior
to
the
stop.
no,
they
did
not.
they
did
not
communicate
until
after,
did
they
ever
communicate
with
st.
bernard
to
find
out,
did
you
ever
issue
a
warrant.
they
were
communicating
back
and
forth
to
their
department
and
their
department
said
there
is
no
flyer,
there
is
no
warrant.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
no,
i
don't
think
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
that's
more
than
just
a
momentary
inconvenience.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
it
is
a
stop,
but
their
purpose
was
not
to
arrest
or
to
hold;
it
was
solely
to
advise
an
individual
of
something.
it
was
a
momentary
inconvenience.
there's
a
difference
between
stopping
the
man
casually
on
the
street
as
you
walk
by
or
you
see
him
or
coming
to
his
home--
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
--or
stopping
him
and
pulling
him
over
and
saying:
mr.
hensley,
st.
bernard
has
issued
a
flyer,
they
want
to
talk
to
you,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and
he
looks
in
and
sees
the
gun.
you
know,
it's
a
situation
with
the
officer
where
he
should
have
been
and
i
don't
see
that
wrong
in
any
way,
shape
or
form.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
and
it's
whether
or
not,
in
addition
to
that,
whether
or
not
there
are
specific
and
articulable
facts
that
that
officer,
when
you
look
at
what
he
had
and
what
he
knew...
and
in
the
whiteley-warden
case,
there
was
a
warrant.
if
the
warrant's
no
good,
then
the
ultimate
action
by
the
officer
is
not
shielded
by
the
wrong
act.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
that's
right.
i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
an
officer
simply
advising
someone
that
another
department
wants
to
talk
to
him.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
i'm
not
asking
you
to
look
inside
the
officer's
head.
i
think
the
officers
themselves
have
testified.
what
i'm
saying
to
the
court
is
that
the
situation
is
such
that
it
is
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
--no.
your
situation
is
one
of,
number
one,
that
an
officer
in
his
normal
course
of
business
runs
across
many
things.
if
the
officer
is
just
simply
following
up
information...
he
sees
the
individual,
he
is
simply
saying,
look,
someone
wants
to
talk
to
you...
i
don't
see
that
as
necessarily
an
abusive
act
on
his
part.
but
when
the
officer's
intent
was
to
arrest,
when
they
were
relying
solely
upon
a
flyer
which
requested
an
illegal
act...
and
let's
take
the
situation
as
presented.
if
in
that
same
set
of
circumstances
the
officer
observes
the
weapon,
we
then
have
to
look,
what
put
that
officer
in
that
place,
whether
it
was
a
warrant
issued
by
a
judge
or
a
flyer
issued
by
another
department.
now,
if
it's
a
flyer
issued
by
another
department,
then
again
he
is
acting
upon
what
another
department
has
requested
him
to
do.
if
you
then
go
back
after
the
stop,
they
find
the
gun,
he
did
nothing
more
than
ask
the
man
or
tell
the
man
something,
it's
then
found
out
that
the
basis
for
him
being
there
was
improper,
then
his
basis
for
being
there
is
no
longer
good.
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
no,
i
don't
perceive
that
as
being
all
right,
because
he
has
to
be...
whatever
his
conduct
for
being
where
he
is
has
to
be
based
upon
some
proper
information.
if
the
flyer
is
issued
and
he
has
acted
upon
the
flyer,
then
we
have
to
look
at
the
flyer.
if
the
flyer's
no
good--
mr.
edward
g.
drennen,
ii
--yes,
i
do,
because
i
don't
think
the
officer
can
pick
and
choose
what
he
wants
to
be
insulated
against.
the
officer
in
covington
is
acting
solely
upon
the
information
he
receives,
nothing
else.
he
can't
say,
i'm
only
going
to
accept
this
portion
which
i
think
is
valid
and
this
portion
which
is
invalid,
because
what
you're
then
asking
the
police
officers
on
the
street
to
do
is
tantamount
to
make
them
lawyers,
make
them
all
go
to
law
school,
make
them
all
become
judges.
i
don't
think
that's
proper.
and
when
an
officer
in
another
department
places
himself
as
a
judge
and
requests
an
illegal
act
to
be
performed,
the
officer
who
performs
it,
even
though
he
is
doing
it
solely
in
totally
good
conscience,
he
is
not
insulated
from
that
act.
and
therefore
what
put
him
in
the
place,
put
him
on
the
street,
put
him
at
the
car
of
mr.
hensley
is
no
good
and
whatever
he
finds
incidental
to
it
is
no
good.
thank
you
very
much.
