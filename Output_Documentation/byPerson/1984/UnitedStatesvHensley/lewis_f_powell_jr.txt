justice
jr.
so
you're
saying
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
warrant
really
isn't
material
to
your
position?
justice
jr.
and
if
all
that
the
first
jurisdiction
had
was
reason
to
make
an
investigatory
stop,
would
that
be
sufficient
for
the
second
jurisdiction
to
rely
on?
justice
jr.
because
there's
no
way
you
can
tell
from
the
flyer
exactly
the
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
flyer
itself.
justice
jr.
i
just
don't
see
any
relevance
to
the
warrant
argument.
