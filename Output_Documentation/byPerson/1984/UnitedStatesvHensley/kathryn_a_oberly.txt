ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
being
a
convicted
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
on
the
theory
that
the
guns
found
in
respondent's
car
were
the
fruits
of
an
illegal
arrest.
the
court's
ruling
was
based
on
two
grounds:
first,
the
court
held
that
investigatory
stops,
commonly
known
as
terry
stops,
may
only
be
made
when
the
police
reasonably
suspect
that
a
crime
is
ongoing
at
the
moment
of
the
investigatory
stop.
because
that
was
not
the
case
here...
respondent
was
stopped
in
connection
with
a
robbery
that
had
been
committed
two
weeks
earlier...
the
court
concluded
that
this
could
not
be
a
valid
investigatory
stop
case.
the
court
then
treated
the
case
as
an
arrest
case
and
concluded
that
the
officers
who
made
what
we
consider
the
stop,
what
the
court
considered
an
arrest,
lacked
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
because
the
facts
they
were
relying
on
were
a
wanted
flyer
issued
by
a
neighboring
police
department
saying
that
respondent
was
wanted
in
connection
with
an
armed
robbery
that
had
been
committed
in
the
neighboring
jurisdiction.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
was
fundamentally
flawed
by
its
initial
ruling
on
the
scope
of
investigatory
stops.
we
actually
find
it
somewhat
hard
to
believe
that
the
court
meant
what
it
said,
because
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
that
limits
investigatory
stops
to
ongoing
crimes,
and
in
fact
the
court
has
repeatedly
said,
as
have
most
of
the
other
circuits,
that
a
police
officer
having
reasonable
suspicion
may
stop
when
he
suspects
that
a
crime
is
being
committed,
is
about
to
be
committed,
or
has
been
committed
in
the
past.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think
that
it
probably
could
be,
your
honor,
although
this
here
is
a
past
felony
offense.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
but
it
would
depend
somewhat
on
the
circumstances.
i
don't
think,
for
example,
that
police
departments
routinely
issue
wanted
flyers
for
people
who
are
suspected
of
having
committed
misdemeanors.
so
that
i
don't
think
it
would
arise
in
the
case
of
a
misdemeanor.
but
i
don't
think
that
there's
any...
in
terms
of
law
enforcement
interests,
the
interest
is
clearly
greater
in
apprehending
suspected
felons.
but
there
is
still
an
interest
on
the
law
enforcement
side
in
apprehending
anyone
suspected
of
committing
a
crime,
whether
it's
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony.
and
so
on
one
side
you
have
the
law
enforcement
interest
in
apprehending
people
suspected
of
committing
crimes,
and
on
the
other
hand,
on
the
other
side
of
the
terry
balance
as
developed
in
subsequent
cases,
you
have
the
intrusion
on
the
individual
being
stopped.
and
so
long
as
the
intrusion
is
sufficiently
limited,
as
it
was
in
this
case...
this
was
the
most
limited
intrusion
imaginable,
the
stop
in
this
case...
then
i
think
that
the
law
enforcement
interest
in
apprehending
people
suspected
of
crimes
would
not
dissipate
simply
because
it
was
a
misdemeanor.
but
that
is,
i
would
stress,
not
our
case
here.
this
is
an
armed
robbery
committed
by
someone
who
all
police
departments
believed
was
armed
and
dangerous,
who
had
a
long
criminal
record,
who
was
known
to
the
police
of
both
departments,
and
this
was
a
very
serious
offense.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
they
certainly
could,
your
honor.
and
flyers
come,
just
like
informant's
tips,
flyers
come
in
all
shapes
and
sizes.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
your
honor.
the
testimony
in
this
case
was
that
this
type
of
flyer
is
as
common
as
a
flyer
that
actually
expressly
indicates
an
arrest
warrant
has
been
issued;
and
that
the
kentucky
officers
who
made
the
stop
found
in
their
experience
that
this
type
of
flyer
generally
was
followed
by
an
arrest
warrant;
and
that
one
of
the
officers
recalled
having
been
told
that
a
warrant
would
be
forthcoming
in
this
case.
all
that
testimony
is
in
the
joint
appendix
from
the
suppression
hearings.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
the
flyer
was
issued
six
days
before
the
covington,
kentucky,
police
department
came
upon
respondent.
and
at
that
point
i
think
it
still
would
have
been
reasonable
for
the
kentucky
police
to
assume...
or
to
at
least
wonder
whether
in
that
intervening
six
days
the
ohio
investigation
had
further
progressed,
so
that
there
might
either
have
been
a
warrant
or
additional
information
to
supply
probable
cause
for
arrest,
or
some
changes--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
but
if
it's
been
computerized
it's
a
matter
of
minutes,
and
they--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
your
honor,
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
what
happened
here
was
the
first
officer...
there
were
many
officers
involved.
the
first
kentucky
officer
spotted
the
respondent
driving
a
car
through
covington.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
he
radioed
to
his
despatcher
and
said:
i
just
spotted
tommy
hensley
and
he
took
off;
could
you
check
and
see
if
there's
a
warrant
on
him?
at
that
point
another
officer,
who
was
in
his
cruiser,
overheard
this
radio
communication
between
the
first
officer
and
the
despatcher,
and
the
second
officer
injected
himself
into
the
radio
communication
and
he
said:
i
think
there
is
a
warrant
on
this
fellow
from
cincinnati.
then
we
switched...
the
radio
communication
switches
to
the
despatcher
trying
to
get
information
out
of
cincinnati
records
about
whether
there
is
or
is
not
an
outstanding
arrest
warrant
on
this
respondent.
at
the
same
time
that
that
radio
communication
is
going
on,
the
officers
are
following
respondent
to
where
they
think
he's
going
to
go.
so
that
at
the
time
they,
the
officers,
converge
on
where
the
respondent
is
and
stop
him
and
pull
his
car
over,
the
inquiry,
which
is
quite
brief
and
can
always
be
quite
brief,
about
whether
there
was
an
outstanding
arrest
warrant
was
practically
completed.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well,
in
this
case
they
never
had
to
find
out
the
answer,
because
within
minutes--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--within
minutes
of
stopping
him--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
don't
think
that...
just
as
the
court
has
said
in
previous
cases,
in
florida
versus
royer,
there's
no
precise
time
limit.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think
that
would
be
excessive
here,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
probably
15
minutes
would
have
been
justifiable.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
and
i
think
that
that
fact
is
totally
irrelevant.
the
officer
said
no--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--if
they
had
enough
officers
to
make
sure
that
they
weren't
going
to
lose
track
of
him,
that
might
be
one
way
to
proceed.
but
that
doesn't
make
the
way
that
they
did
proceed
unreasonable
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
i
mean,
this
is...
again
i
stress,
this
was
the
most
limited
intrusion
possible.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
which
is
clearly
permissible
under
pennsylvania
versus
mimms.
the
first
officer
who
arrived--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that
man
had
made
a
traffic
violation.
this
man
was
suspected
of
being
an
armed
and
dangerous
felon,
who
was
wanted
for
an
armed
robbery
that
had
been
committed
in
the
very
recent
past.
and
the
officers
had
good...
far
more
reason
than
the
officers
in
pennsylvania
versus
mimms
to
fear
for
their
own
safety.
and
ordering
these...
respondent--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--the
officers
here,
your
honor,
were
not
relying
on
having
seen
him
commit
a
traffic
offense,
having
seen
him
do
anything
else
wrong
in
their
presence.
they
were
relying
on
the
flyer
that
was
issued
by
the
st.
bernard
police
department.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
because
he
was
in
a
moving
automobile.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
and
i
don't--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
as
soon
as
he
saw--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--there's
no
testimony
as
to
how
fast
he
took
off.
he
took
off
fast
enough
to
arouse
their
suspicions,
but
it
doesn't
say
that
he
necessarily
accelerated
so
rapidly
that
he
was
violating
the
speeding
laws,
and
we're
not
contending
that.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
we're
not
contending
that
at
all.
we
think
that
whether
or
not
he
was
violating
a
traffic
law
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
basis
for
the
stop
here.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well,
my
car
doesn't
take
off
too
fast.
when
you
take
off,
you
wouldn't
necessarily
immediately
be
violating
the
speeding
laws.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
pardon?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
you
have
to
start
at
zero,
your
honor,
and
then
it
depends
on
how
rapidly
you
can
accelerate.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
critical.
in
our
view
where
the
court
of
appeals
went
wrong
here
was
in
focusing
on
the
information
that
the
covington
officers
knew.
what's
relevant
is
what
the
st.
bernard
officers
knew.
the
district
court
here
found
that
the
st.
bernard
officers
had
enough
information...
had
enough
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
respondent.
this
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that
issue.
all
the
court
has
to
conclude
is
that
the
st.
bernard
officers
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
a
terry
stop
of
respondent
if
they
had
encountered
him
first.
if
they
had,
then
what
the
covington
officers
are
doing
is
basically
acting
as
the
agents
of
the
st.
bernard
officers.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
under
this
court's
ruling
in
whiteley
versus
warden,
that
would
be
the
result,
unless...
and
we
don't
contend
it's
present
in
this
case,
but
the
exception
would
be
if
the
covington
officers
had
somehow
prior
to
the
stop
developed
their
own
information
to
justify
a
stop.
but
since
they
were
making
the
stop
here
solely
in
reliance
on
the
st.
bernard
flyer,
the
validity
of
that
stop
turns
back
to
the
validity
of
the
issuance
of
the
flyer.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
for
this
case,
we
only
ask
that
you
determine
the
latter,
that
the
terry
stop
may
be
made
long
enough
to
determine
if
there's
a
warrant
outstanding.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct,
and
that's
the
uncontroverted
arrest.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
there
was
no
interrogation,
your
honor,
by
the
kentucky
officers,
except
to--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--they
stopped
him...
the
uncontroverted
testimony
is
they
stopped
him
solely
to
find
out
whether
there
was
an
arrest
warrant.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no.
they
stopped
him
because
they
needed
time
to...
he
was
going
to
take
off,
as
justice
marshall
has
pointed
out.
he'd
already
started
to
take
off.
so
they
stopped
him.
they
did
exactly
what
this
court
said
was
permissible
in
adams
versus
williams,
which
is
to
maintain
the
status
quo
momentarily
while
they
obtained
more
information.
the
more
information
they
needed
was
a
computer
check
on
whether
there
was
an
arrest
warrant
on
respondent.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
it
did.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
correct.
well,
the
district
court
found
based
on
probable
cause,
but--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--we're
willing
to
submit
it--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--his
testimony
is
conflicting.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
for
questioning.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
but
the
covington
officers
who
made
the
stop
had
no
intention
of
detaining
this
fellow
for
questioning.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
they
could
not
and
would
not,
according
to
the
testimony,
have
done
that.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
because
they
would
have
known,
upon
finding
out
that
there
was
no
warrant,
that
the
st.
bernard...
that
the
initiating
department,
the
st.
bernard
police,
did
not
have
probable
cause.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
to
find
out
whether--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct,
and
they
could
have.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
they
could
have...
well--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--they
could
have
stopped
him
long
enough
to
call
the
st.
bernard
police
or
called
the
computer
people
and
say,
is
there
a
warrant.
let's
say
the
answer
comes
back--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--the
answer
comes
back
no...
and
i'm
trying
to
follow
up
on
the
question.
the
answer
comes
back
no,
but
the
st.
bernard
police
say,
we
would
still
like
to
question
him.
at
that
point
the
covington
police
would
have
to
decide
how
long
would
they
have
to
detain
respondent
before
the
st.
bernard
police
could
arrive
to
ask
their
questions.
and
at
some
point
the
government
would
concede
that
detention
might
be
too
long
to
exceed
the
permissible
founds
of
the
terry
stop.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
to
ask...
what
they
wanted
to
stop
respondent
for
was
for
questioning.
he
would
not
have
had
to
submit
to
the
questioning.
they
could
have
stopped
him
and
said,
we'd
like
you
to
come
talk
to
us
about
this
robbery.
and,
absent
probable
cause,
he
could
have
said,
i
don't
care
to
talk
to
you,
and
he
would
have
been
free
to
go
on
his
way.
but
they
certainly
had
the
authority,
the
st.
bernard
police,
certainly
had
the
authority
to
make
the
initial
stop
to
see
whether
the
respondent
was
willing
to
cooperate
in
questioning.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
except
the
problem
here
is
that
the
covington
police
wouldn't
have
known
what
to
question
him
about.
so
that
all
the
covington
police
would
do--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
correct.
but
i
mean
if--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--yes,
if
they'd
been
given
specific...
that's
an
entirely
different
situation.
if
they'd
been
given
specific
information
by
the
initiating
department,
they're
entitled
to
rely
on
that,
just
as
they're
entitled
to
rely
on
the
flyer.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
from
the
record,
it
appears
that
it
was
within
three
minutes.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
three
minutes.
the
first
officer
stopped
and
waited
for
backup
units
to
arrive
and
did
nothing
except
keep
the
suspects
under
control
until
the
backup
units
arrived.
that
took
three
minutes
or
less.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes.
the
first
officer
ordered
them
out
of
the
car
and
asked
them
to
put
their
hands
on
the
roof
of
the
car,
for
his
own,
the
officer's
own,
protection
and
then
waited
for
his
backup
units
to
arrive.
when
the
first
backup
unit
arrived,
the
officer
in
that
car
immediately
spotted
part
of
the
gun
in
plain
view
in
the
car,
and
at
that
point
the
warrant
flyer
completely
drops
out
of
the
case
and
the
basis
for
everything
that
happened
after
that
point
is
the
covington
officer's
own
independent
observation
of
the
gun
in
plain
view
in
the
car.
to
sum
up,
it's
our
position
on
the
two
points
in
the
court's
analysis
that:
terry
stops
simply
can't
rationally
be
limited
to
ongoing
crimes;
and
second,
that
this
court's
holding
in
whiteley
versus
warden
makes
it
quite
clear
that
officers
of
one
department
are
entitled
to
rely
on
information
supplied
by
officers
of
a
second
department,
so
long
as
the
first
department
has
the
requisite
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause,
as
the
case
may
be,
to
justify
the
action
that's
taken.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it
does
not
tell
us
precisely,
your
honor.
but
based
on
the
radio
transmission
which
was
going
on
at
the
same
time,
it
had
to
have
been
a
period
of
two
minutes
or
less.
all
off
this
was
happening
simultaneously.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
and
they
never
testified
or
attempted
to
justify
the
stop
based
on
their
own
observation
of
a
violation
of
law.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that
is
not
the
way
i
would
judge...
it's
not
a
common
sense
reading
of
the
words
"took
off".
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
interpret
it,
in
the
context
of
a
police
radio
transmission,
that
one
officer
says
he
sees
the
suspect,
the
suspect
saw
him
and
immediately
took
off,
as
an
indication
of
flight.
but
again,
we're
not--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i'd
like
to
be
able
to
say
yes,
your
honor.
but
since
we
have
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
it,
i
don't
feel
that
i
could
definitively
say
yes.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
if
you
have
sufficient
officers--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--your
honor,
if
you
have
sufficient
officers
that
may
all
be
possible.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
with
one
car
at
this
point,
who
seeks
the
vehicle
take
off...
i
can't
tell
you
how
fast
that
was
because
the
record
doesn't
say.
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
proposing
may
have
been
one
reasonable
way
to
proceed.
but
also,
stopping
the
car
for
this
very
limited
intrusion
is
equally
reasonable
and
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
any
more
than
your
proposal
would.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
for
the
officer's
own
safety,
because
the
wanted
bulletin
that
they
were
relying
on
said
consider
these
men
armed
and
dangerous,
and
the
covington
officers
knew
from...
they
knew
this
respondent.
he
was
a
local
boy.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
they
knew
he
was
armed
and
dangerous.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
two
cars?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
police
officer
wasn't
parked,
so
far
as
i
know.
he
was
cruising.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
right,
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
don't
think
that
having
the
officer
sit
in
his
car
ensures
that
the
suspect's
car
is
also
going
to
remain
immobile
and
stay
where
it
is.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
not
given
what
they
knew
about
these
suspects,
not
at
all.
i
just
again
would
like
to
say
that
your
proposed
course
of
action
is
reasonable,
but
that
does
not
make
what
the
covington
officers
did
here
unreasonable
or
unconstitutional
in
the
fourth
amendment
sense.
what
they
did
seemed
to
be
the
most
prudent
course
of
action
to
take
at
the
time
they
were
confronted
with
the
situation
where
they
had
to
make
a
swift
decision.
that
entire
set
of
circumstances
forms
the
basis
for
this
court's
terry
cases
and
post-terry
cases,
that
we're
not
going
to
second
guess
officers
on
the
beat
who
make
a
reasonable
decision
and
say,
well,
you
could
have
done
it
in
another
manner
and
therefore
what
you
did
was
wrong.
i
don't
find
anything
wrong
whatsoever
with
the
way
the
officers
proceeded
in
this
case,
even
if
there
are
multiple
alternative
methods
that
they
could
have
employed.
and
finally,
i
would
just
like
to
emphasize
that
this
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
would
prohibit
one
department
from
relying
on
a
flyer
issued
by
another
department
basically
is
a
windfall
for
criminals
who
are
able
to
get
out
of
the
first
jurisdiction--
once
they've
escaped
the
first
jurisdiction,
no
other
department
can
stop
them.
and
there's
nothing
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
nothing
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
would
suggest
that
criminals
who
are
that
fortunate
to
rapidly
escape
the
jurisdiction
in
which
they
committed
their
crime
should
never
thereafter
be
able
to
be
apprehended
again
simply
because
they've
moved
into
someone
else's
area.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
and
we're
in
the
middle
ground,
where
they
needed
a
very
brief
period
of
time
to
find
out
whether
there
was
a
warrant.
again,
that's
a
classic
adams
versus
williams
situation,
the
language
in
adams,
maintaining
the
status
quo
to
find
out
more
information,
something
that
would
have
immediately
resolved
the
matter
one
way
or
another
with
minimal
intrusion
on
the
defendant's
privacy
interest.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
hope
that
i
haven't
said
they
couldn't.
i
think
that
they
can,
if
the
first
police--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--my
position
is
that,
if
the
first
police
department
has
the
requisite
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause,
as
the
case
may
be,
for
the
action
that
it
would
take
if
it
had
been
the
acting
department,
the
second
department
can
take
the
same
action.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
whiteley
versus
warden,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct,
and
the
only
caveat
to
is
that
the
information
known
to
the
first
department
has
to
be
adequate,
has
to
be
either
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
if
he
doesn't
know--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no.
no,
because
he
has...
the
first
department,
your
honor,
could
also
make
a
terry
stop.
the
first
department,
which
clearly
knows
there's
no
warrant
because
it
would
have
issued
the
warrant
or
obtained
the
warrant
if
there
was
one,
could
still
male
an
investigatory
stop
and
when
they
come
across
the
respondent
say,
we'd
like
you
to
come
talk
to
us,
we'd
like
to
question
you.
the
respondent
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
submit,
but
that
doesn't
negate
the
authority
of
the
first
department
to
make
the
stop.
the
second
department
in
turn
can
likewise
make
a
stop
based
on--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no.
no,
your
honor,
they
can't
be
presumed
to
know
it.
to
find
out
what
they
need
to
know
to
assess
what
their
future
course
of
action
will
be,
which
is
either
immediately
release
him
or
find
out
that
there's
an
arrest
warrant
and
therefore
they
arrest
him.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
don't
see
how
they
can
be
presumed
to
know
that.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
they're
presumed
to
take
any
action
that
the
first
department
could
take.
and
it's
clear
here
that
the
first
department
could
have
made
a
stop
based
upon
reasonable
suspicion,
which
is
all
that
the
second
department
did.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct,
because
what
we're
relying
on
here
is
an
investigatory
stop,
which
obviously
does
not
require
a
warrant.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
that
translates.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
warrant
argument
addresses
a
wholly
different
set
of
facts
which
we
don't
have
in
this
case.
i
mean,
it
could
arise
frequently
in
the
context
of
these
interdepartmental
cooperation
cases.
but
in
our
particular
case
all
that's
needed
is
that
department
a
have
reasonable
suspicion,
that
reasonable
suspicion
is
imputed
to
department
b
and
department
b
can
likewise
make
an
investigatory
stop.
and
here
they
took
the
most
reasonable
action
possible,
which
was
immediately
find
out
whether
there
was
a
basis
for
escalating
their
action.
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
briefly,
your
honor,
the
case
seems
in
the
last
hour
to
have
gotten
somewhat
confused
by
a
lot
of
different
factual
situations,
and
i
would
just
like
to
reiterate
our
two
main
points,
which
i
don't
think
depend
on
all
the
hypotheticals.
one
is
terry
stops
are
not
and
cannot
be
limited
to
ongoing
crimes.
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
criminals
are
home
free
once
they
get
away
with
their
crime
and
they're
not
immediately
detected,
and
we
would
strongly
urge
that
that
aspect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
be
reversed.
the
second
point
is
that
it
has
long
been
recognized
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
that
police
departments
must
and
are
able
to
cooperate
with
each
other;
that
it
is
not
necessary
that
they
cross-examine
each
other
about
the
basis
of
the
first
department's
knowledge.
and
in
this
case
there
was
no
reason
that
the
covington
officers
had
to
know
precisely
what
the
st.
bernard
officers
had
to
know.
yet
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
required
in
this
case.
they
said
the
stop...
the
arrest
was
defective
because
the
covington
officers
did
not
have
the
personal
knowledge
that
the
st.
bernard
officers
had.
in
our
view
that
personal
knowledge
is
not
required.
thank
you.
