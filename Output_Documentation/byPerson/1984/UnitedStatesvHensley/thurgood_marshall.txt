justice
marshall
well,
wasn't
there
testimony
that
"he
took
off"?
justice
marshall
you
just
said
a
minute
ago
that
he
wasn't
violating
the
speed
limit.
can
you
"take
off"
without
violating
the
speed
limit?
justice
marshall
well,
when
you
take
off,
how
fast
are
you
going?
justice
marshall
then
you
wouldn't
say
he
was
taking
off,
would
you?
justice
marshall
isn't
55
miles
an
hour?
justice
marshall
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
if
a
warrant
is
outstanding
in
st.
bernard,
everything
that
happened
here
would
have
been
all
right?
justice
marshall
but
that
information
they
got
a
little
bit
after
they
found
the
gun.
justice
marshall
no,
i'm
talking
about
when
they
picked
him
up,
when
they
found
out
that
there
was
no
warrant.
that
was
after
they
had
found
the
gun.
justice
marshall
i
said
that
the
other
side
didn't,
st.
bernard,
did
not
have
a
warrant.
when
did
they
find
that
out?
justice
marshall
before
or
after
they
found
the
gun?
justice
marshall
when?
five
minutes
after?
justice
marshall
i'm
talking
about
five
months
before.
i'm
talking
about
when
mr.
hensley
was
stopped
and
they
found
the
gun.
when
in
time
did
they
find
out
that
there
was
no
outstanding
warrant?
before
or
after
they
found
the
gun
on
that
particular
day,
not
months
before?
justice
marshall
sir?
justice
marshall
well,
that's
not
according
to
the
testimony
i
read.
i
read
the
testimony
that
they
called
to
find
out.
justice
marshall
well,
let's
take
it
easy.
they
called
to
find
out
if
there
was
an
outstanding
warrant.
justice
marshall
two,
they
found
out
there
was
no
outstanding
warrant.
justice
marshall
three,
they
found
the
gun.
justice
marshall
now,
have
you
got
all
three
of
those
situations--
justice
marshall
--timewise,
what
was
first?
justice
marshall
right.
justice
marshall
and
what
was
second?
justice
marshall
are
you
taking
the
position
you
don't
understand
what
i'm
saying?
justice
marshall
well,
forget
it.
