we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
hensley.
ms.
oberly,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
how
long
after
the
stop
did
they
observe
the
gun?
chief
justice
burger
how
long?
chief
justice
burger
now,
was
he
out
of
the
car?
chief
justice
burger
why
in
your
view
can't
the
second
police
department
do
anything
the
first
police
department
could
do
if
they
were
there
on
the
ground?
chief
justice
burger
i
got
an
implication
that
you
negated
that.
chief
justice
burger
haven't
we
in
one
case
said
that
the
knowledge
of
the
one
policeman...
it
was
a
case
out
in
wyoming.
chief
justice
burger
the
knowledge
of
one
policeman
is
the
knowledge
of
all,
and
the
second
one
may
act
on
what
the
first
man
tells
him
just
as
though
he
knew
all
of
the
things
the
first
man
did.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
drennen.
chief
justice
burger
the
flyer
said
he
was
armed
and
dangerous,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
oberly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
