justice
rehnquist
but
they
didn't
stop
him
as
a
source
of
information
as
to
whether
there
was
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
rehnquist
you
say
the
st.
bernard
police
also
could
have
made
a
terry
stop.
justice
rehnquist
but
now,
they
knew
that
there
was
no
warrant,
because
the
warrant
would
have
been
obtained
by
them.
what
would
they
have
been
making
the
terry
stop
for?
justice
rehnquist
the
covington
police
could
have
done
the
same
thing
in
your
view?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
drennen,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
little
bit
different
view
of
these
facts
than
you're
now
stating.
at
least
their
opinion
recites
the
officers'
testimony
that
they
only
wanted
to
determine
if
there
was
a
warrant
and
that
officer
coke
testified
he
intended
to
release
hensley.
justice
rehnquist
well,
we're
not
hear
to
parse
through
minute
factual
details
in
the
record.
we
have
a
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
point
of
law
that
we
think
should
be
reviewed.
