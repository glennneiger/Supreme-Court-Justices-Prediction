justice
stevens
may
i
ask
if
the
law
enforcement
interest
would
have
been
served
if
the
wanted
flyer
disclosed
whether
or
not
a
warrant
had
been
issued
for
the
individual?
could
the
police
departments
have
a
practice
of
either
having
the
flyers
say
there
was
or
was
not
a
warrant?
justice
stevens
except
that
the
police
can
control
what
they
put
in
the
flyers,
but
you
can't
control
the
informer's
tips.
justice
stevens
but
if
the
flyer
had
said
there
is
no
warrant
outstanding,
then
i
take
it
they
wouldn't
have
even
stopped
him?
justice
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
how
long
it
normally
takes
to
find
out
if
a
warrant
is
outstanding?
justice
stevens
and
had
they
been
able
to
get
that
information
in
that
matter
of
minutes,
they
could
have
avoided
the
necessity
for
a
stop,
is
that
not
right?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
and
how
much
additional
time
would
you
judge
was
required
to
find
out
the
answer?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
they
arrested
him
for
something
else.
but
the
choice,
i
suppose,
is
between
stopping
him
and
detaining
him
for...
how
long
a
period
are
they
permitted
to
detain
him
in
the
government's
submission?
justice
stevens
well,
would
they
have
kept
him
for
an
hour?
justice
stevens
could
they
have
kept
for
15
minutes?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
they
could
have
kept
him
under
surveillance
while
he
was
in
his
car
for
15
minutes?
he
was
not
breaking
any
speed
law,
as
i
understand.
justice
stevens
well,
if
they
can
tail
the
man
who's
abiding
by
the
law
while
he's
driving
through
the
street
for
the
same
period
of
time
it
takes
to
get
the
information,
why
isn't
that
preferable?
justice
stevens
well,
they
made
him
put
his
hands
up
on
the
car
and
they
pulled
a
gun
on
him.
justice
stevens
well,
it's
not
the
same
as
pennsylvania
against
mimms,
because
that
man
had
violated
the
law
in
the
pennsylvania
case.
justice
stevens
there's
a
different
legal
justification?
they
did
not
have
a
violation
of
law
to
go
on.
justice
stevens
and
on
their
own
inability
to
keep
him
under
surveillance
for
the
time
to
determine
whether
the
warrant
was
outstanding.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well,
it's
clear
he
did
not
violate
the
law--
justice
stevens
--or
that
surely
would
be
in
the
record.
justice
stevens
ms.
oberly,
if
you're
summing
up,
does
the
record
tell
us...
because
these
words
"took
off"
create
an
impression
that
may
be
inaccurate,
does
the
record
tell
us
the
length
of
time
between
when
the
vehicle
started
to
move
and
when
it
was
stopped?
justice
stevens
and
as
i
remember
it,
the
magistrate
indicated
that
one
of
the
officers
said
there
had
been
no
violation,
no
speeding
in
violation
of
law
that
he
observed
before
stopping
him;
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
so
should
we
judge
the
case
as
though
the
words
"took
off"
merely
meant
they
have
started
the
vehicle
in
motion?
justice
stevens
well,
what
do
you
interpret
them
to
mean?
justice
stevens
if
it
were
an
indication
of
flight,
isn't
it
almost
a
certainty
that
they
would
have
violated
the
speed
limit
within
two
minutes?
justice
stevens
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
about
the
government
case
is
that
it
sounds
as
though
the
stop
was
necessary
to
prevent
the
man
from
getting
away
from
the
officers.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
know
if
you're
really
arguing
that
or
not.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
support
that,
other
than
the
words
"took
off"?
because
normally,
if
a
vehicle
is
not
violating
the
speed
limit,
normally
it
can
be
kept
in...
you
know,
it
can
be
followed
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
without
losing
it.
justice
stevens
and
if
you're
only
trying
to
find
out
if
there
was
a
warrant
outstanding,
i
don't
understand
why
a
competent
officer
couldn't
just
keep
the
car
in
surveillance
while
he
radios
the
station
and
says,
tell
us
whether
there's
a
warrant
out
for
him.
justice
stevens
even
one.
justice
stevens
why
would
it
be
necessary
to
order
him
out
of
the
car
while
they
check
with
the...
asked
about
the--
justice
stevens
--i
understand
that,
but
couldn't
they
park
their
car--
justice
stevens
--where
were
the
two
cars
parked
when
they
stopped
him?
justice
stevens
the
police
officer's
car--
justice
stevens
--but
i
mean,
when
he
stopped
the
other
vehicle,
his
vehicle
also
came
to
a
stop,
i
assume.
justice
stevens
and
where
were
the
two
cars,
next
to
one
another?
couldn't
they
both
have
sat
in
their
cars
and
he
radiced
and
asked,
is
there
a
warrant
outstanding?
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
so,
with
the
lights
flashing
and
the
police
car--
justice
stevens
--well,
that's
really
not
quite
right,
because
if
they
would
advise
whether
there's
a
warrant
outstanding
that
would
decide
whether
or
not
they
could
stop
them.
as
i
understand
your
position,
if
they
had
been
told
there
was
no
warrant
they
could
not
have
stopped.
if
they'd
been
told
there
was
a
warrant,
then
there's
no
question
about
the
legality.
a
very
simple
rule.
justice
stevens
if
you
take
that
position,
then
the
second
officer
must
have
known
there
was
no
warrant
outstanding.
you
don't
want
him
to
know
that.
why
not?
justice
stevens
if
he
knows
there's
no
warrant,
you
would
agree
he
could
not
stop
him?
justice
stevens
to
find
out
what
they're
presumed
already
to
know?
justice
stevens
are
they
or
are
they
not
presumed
to
know
there
was
no
warrant
outstanding?
justice
stevens
then
they
are
not
presumed
to
know
everything
that
the
other
office
knows.
justice
stevens
mr.
drennen,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
if
i'm
not
interrupting
your
answer?
supposing
we
change
the
facts
just
a
little
bit
here
and
say
that
the
covington
department
knew
there
was
no
probable
cause,
knew
there
was
no
warrant,
knew
that
the
other
department
merely
wanted
to
question
the
man
on
reasonable
suspicion.
and
they
stopped...
they
saw
the
defendant
and
they
stopped
him
in
motion
on
the
streets
and
just
pulled
him
over
to
the
side,
got
out
of
the
car,
went
up
to
the
window
and
said
to
him:
i
would
like
you
to
know
you're
under
suspicion
over
in
cincinnati
or
the
other
town
and
they
would
like
you
to
stop
in
and
talk
to
them;
you
may
want
to
exonerate
yourself,
or
something
like
that.
and
during
such
a
conversation
they
saw
through
the
window
the
guns.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
but
it's
a
stop.
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
saying
pulling
a
car
over,
pulling
a
car
over.
justice
stevens
so
your
whole
attack
on
this
is
based
on
getting
him
out
of
the
car
and
drawing
the
gun?
justice
stevens
but
you've
conceded
they
could
stop
the
vehicle
even
though
there
were
no
warrant
and
everybody
knew
there
were
no
warrant?
