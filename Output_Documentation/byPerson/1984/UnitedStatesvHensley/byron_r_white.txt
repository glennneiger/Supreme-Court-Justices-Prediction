justice
white
well,
ms.
oberly,
the
flyer
asked
the
police
to
stop
this
man,
didn't
it?
justice
white
and
based
on
just
reasonable
suspicion,
i
suppose.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
white
--the
officer
who
issued
it
didn't
even
think
he
had
probable
cause.
justice
white
yes.
well,
anyway,
let's
assume
there
was
only
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
white
so
they
asked
another
police
department
to
stop
him.
what
do
you
think
they
wanted
them
to
stop...
the
other
police
department
to
do
when
they
stopped
him?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
all
right.
let's
suppose
that
in
the
radio
communication
they
were
told:
no,
no
warrant
has
issued
yet,
but
our
flyer
is
still
good;
please
stop
this
man.
justice
white
why
would
you
say
they
could
not
stop
him?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
thought
your
point
was
they
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
a
stop.
justice
white
i
would
think
you...
i
thought
your
position
was
that
the
people
who
issued
the
flyer
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
a
terry
stop.
justice
white
and
if
they
had
encountered
the
man
first,
they
would
have
stopped
him.
justice
white
why
couldn't
the
people
who
received
the
flyer
do
the
same
thing?
justice
white
legally,
under
your
position.
justice
white
well,
i
know
that.
but
suppose
there's
no
warrant.
justice
white
yes,
but
that
isn't
a
legal
argument.
that's
just
a
practical
argument.
justice
white
suppose
the
st.
bernard
police
had
said:
please
ask
him
the
following
two
questions.
wouldn't
you
say
that
they
could
have
stopped
him
and
asked
him
those
two
questions?
