justice
o'connor
ms.
oberly,
do
you
take
the
position
that
a
terry
stop
could
be
made
to
investigate
a
past
misdemeanor
offense?
justice
o'connor
yes,
i
know.
justice
o'connor
ms.
oberly,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
this
case
if
the
st.
bernard
police
in
fact
didn't
have
enough
information
to
justify
a
reasonable
terry
stop?
justice
o'connor
and
if
the
st.
bernard
officers
did
not
have
sufficient
information
in
their
possession
to
justify
issuance
of
the
flyer,
you
would
suggest
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
st.
bernard
police
could
properly
ask
another
police
department
to
detain
the
respondent
until
they
got
there
for
something
like
that,
or
are
you
just
asking
this
court
to
determine
that
a
terry
stop
can
be
made
long
enough
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
warrant
outstanding?
justice
o'connor
well,
are
you
suggesting,
then,
that
we're
to
decide
this
case
on
the
premise
that
the
stop
by
the
kentucky
officers
was
only
until
they
had
time
enough
to
find
out
whether
an
arrest
warrant
had
issued?
justice
o'connor
mr.
drennen,
would
you
concede
that
the
st.
bernard
police
could
have
made
a
terry
stop
of
the
respondent
in
their
jurisdiction
on
reasonable
suspicion,
even
though
no
warrant
had
issued.
justice
o'connor
all
right.
now,
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that
point
and
think
the
st.
bernard
police
could
have
made
a
terry
stop
to
do
what
ms.
oberly's
suggesting,
to
wit,
ask
him
whether
he'd
be
willing
to
come
in
and
talk
to
them
about
a
robbery?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
all
right,
but
i'm
asking
you
to
suppose
for
a
moment
that
the
st.
bernard
police
could
have
made
a
terry
stop.
could
the
covington
police,
acting
on
the
same
information,
do
the
same?
justice
o'connor
well,
i'm
asking
you
about
the
stop,
not
the
content
of
the
questions.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
the
testimony
is
that
an
officer
saw
a
gun
in
the
open
door
of
the
vehicle.
justice
o'connor
and
that
provided
the
justification
for
a
further
search.
justice
o'connor
within
three
minutes.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
drennen,
your
argument
seems
to
turn,
at
least
in
part,
on
the
thoughts
in
the
mind
of
the
covington
police
officers
who
made
the
stop,
rather
than
on
objectively
examining
what
they
did
and
what
happened.
you
want
us
to
look
inside
their
head
and
say:
well,
what
they
intended
to
do
was
to
make
some
lengthy
detention
here
which
they
have
no
authority
to
do.
now,
we
don't
do
that
normally,
do
we?
don't
we
have
to
look
at
what
happened,
not
at
what
was
in
one
of
the
officer's
heads
at
the
time?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
officer
could
legitimately
have
made
a
brief
stop,
as
you
just
indicated
to
justice
stevens,
and
that
objectively
is
what
had
happened
here
at
the
time
the
gun
was
seen,
then
don't
we
stop
there?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
suppose
we
agree
with
you
that
the
st.
bernard
police
could
not
properly
ask
another
department
to
make
an
extended
detention
of
someone
until
they
arrive.
but
let's
also
suppose
that
the
arresting
officer
in
covington
knew
that
request
was
improper
and
all
he
was
going
to
do
was
make
a
proper
stop
to
say:
look,
you
ought
to
go
across
the
river
and
talk
to
the
st.
bernard
police.
isn't
that
all
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
suppose
part
of
the
flyer
is
properly
set
forth
information
and
part
isn't,
and
he
ignores
the
improper
part.
is
that
invalid?
