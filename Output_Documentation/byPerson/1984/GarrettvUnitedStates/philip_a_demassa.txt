mr.
philip
a.
demassa
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
whether
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
under
title
21,
section
848
of
the
united
states
code
is
a
substantive
offense,
and
the
relationship
between
it
and
its
underlying
predicate
drug
felonies,
which
are
either
part
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
or
were
introduced
by
the
government
in
the
cce
prosecution.
to
discuss
the
facts
of
petitioner's
case
is
to
highlight
the
double
jeopardy
violations
which
petitioner
suffered
due
to
the
government's
improper
successive
prosecution
and
cumulative
punishment
of
him
for
the
same
conduct
for
the
same
offense.
petitioner
was
indicted
in
march
1981
in
the
western
district
of
washington
with
three
of
the
four
counts
of
that
indictment.
count
ii
charged
petitioner
with
causing
an
informant,
joseph
knowles,
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
from
panama
city,
florida,
the
ultimate
place
where
petitioner
was
then
indicted
in
a
second
indictment
to
go
to
seattle,
washington,
for
the
purposes
of
engaging
in
a
marijuana
offense.
count
iii
charged
petitioner
with
importing
12,000
pounds
of
marijuana
into
neah
bay,
washington.
that
occurred
in
august
of
1980.
count
iv
charged
petitioner
with
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
that
same
marijuana.
petitioner
was
not
charged
in
count
i
of
that
indictment
which
alleged
a
conspiracy
to
import
marijuana
which
occurred
from
september
1979
through
august
of
1980.
he
was,
however,
named
as
a
co-conspirator
involved
in
that
activity
which
involved
witnesses
and
evidence
from
the
northern
district
of
florida.
at
one
of
petitioner's
first
bail
hearings
in
washington
state,
the
government
prosecutor,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
was
in
charge
of
the
prosecution
of
petitioner,
advised
the
district
court
that
the
department
of
justice
in
washington
had
originally
authorized
petitioner's
indictment
in
washington
state
on
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge.
however,
he
advised
the
court,
instead
that
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
was
being
considered
by
the
northern
district
of
florida
grand
jury
and
not
by
his
grand
jury
in
seattle.
petitioner
at
that
hearing
on
april
8th
immediately
asked
that
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
be
joined
in
washington
state
to
be
tried
with
the
other
indictment
then
pending.
the
government
attorney
represented,
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
that
petitioner
had
been
responsible
for
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise,
and
the
grand
jury...
presumably
he
meant
the
grand
jury
in
seattle
washington...
would
have
returned
an
indictment.
the
government
told
the
court:
this
coordinated
investigation
from
washington,
d.c.,
showed
petitioner's
involvement
in
four
or
five
1977
through
1980.
during
the
next
two
weeks
after
these
statements
from
the
government
prosecutor,
petitioner
filed
two
motions
of
note
to
this
court.
first
was
a
motion
for
bill
of
particulars,
as
petitioner
alleged
in
his
moving
papers,
so
that
he
could
be
protected
against
a
second
prosecution,
and
so
that
he
might
plead
double
jeopardy.
petitioner,
more
importantly,
filed
a
motion
to
compel
consolidation
of
any
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
so
that
that
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
would
be
tried
in
washington
state.
in
petitioner's
motion,
he
alleged
that
the
government
prosecutor
had
stated
that
his
directives...
that
is,
the
government
prosecutor's
directives...
from
the
justice
department
were
to
omit
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
in
the
washington
state
indictment.
petitioner
alleged
that
the
government
was
manipulating
venue
for
the
cce
prosecution
where
a
more
favorable
prosecution
and
seeking
to
enhance
any
subsequent
sentence.
petitioner
alleged
that
the
prosecutor
had
advised
him...
that
is,
petitioner's
counsel...
that
the
prosecutor
had
been
prepared
to
try
the
defendant
for
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge,
but
was
instructed
by
the
justice
department
not
to
seek
that
indictment.
petitioner
moved
in
this
motion,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
for
a
number
of
grounds.
number
one,
to
defend
all
charges
in
the
same
trial.
number
two,
to
have
the
case
transferred
to
another
district
due
to
his
financial
hardship
in
defending
in
two
separate
courts.
three,
to
join
the
offenses
in
one
proceeding;
to
seek
a
single
trial
of
both
indictments;
that
venue
was
proper
on
the
cce
charge
in
washington
state;
that
the
charges
in
washington
and
florida
were
the
same
offense.
the
government's
response
was
that
since
there
were
no
other
charges
pending,
there
were
no
charges
to
consolidate.
on
may
18th
of
that
year,
petitioner
pleaded
guilty
in
washington
to
count
iii,
the
importation
of
marijuana
count.
sixty
days
later
on
july
16th,
petitioner
was
indicted
in
the
northern
district
of
florida
for
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise,
also
a
conspiracy
ranging
from
january
1976
to
july
16,
1981,
to
import
marijuana
and
"thai
sticks",
a
conspiracy
also
on
the
same
dates
to
possess
with
intent
to
distribute
marijuana,
and
four
telephone
counts.
the
thai
sticks,
incidentally,
do
not
occur
except
in
the
indictment
with
relation
to
the
neah
bay,
washington,
episode.
there
are
no
thai
sticks
alleged
to
have
occurred
in
any
other
episode
involving
petitioner
except
in
the
neah
bay,
washington,
episode.
on
august
20,
petitioner
was
sentenced
in
washington
state
on
his
importation
plea
to
the
maximum
five
years
and
$15,000
fine
and
a
three-year
special
parole
term.
in
florida...
back
again...
on
september
23rd,
petitioner
moved
to
dismiss
the
cce
and
the
conspiracy
counts,
claiming
he
was
being
twice
prosecuted
for
the
same
offense
in
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss,
holding
that
a
conspiracy
and
a
substantive
offense
can
be
prosecuted
separately
since
they
are
separate
crimes.
using
some
of
the
very
same
evidence
it
had
used
to
convict
petitioner
in
washington
state,
he
was
convicted
of
both
conspiracies,
a
telephone
count,
and
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
no.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
no
evidence
was
introduced
in
washington
either.
after
discovery
procedures,
petitioner
plead
guilty
in
washington,
so
he
never
had
a
trial
in
washington
in
any
event.
however,
the
evidence
which
was
developed
in
washington
was
certainly
introduced...
12,000
pounds'
worth
of
photographs
of
thai
sticks
on
the
beach.
the
other
material,
three
or
four
witnesses
from
seattle,
washington.
they
flew
a
chemist
in
from
honolulu
specifically
to
identify
a
thai
stick
as
a
form
of
marijuana.
so
there
was
substantial
evidence
introduced
the
last
two
days
of
petitioner's
trial
in
florida.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
yes--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--yes.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
yes,
there
was.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
there
might
have
been,
your
honor.
however,
it
is
impossible
to
say
at
this
point
what
evidence
the
jury
considered
in
arriving
at
the
verdict
on
the
cce
charge.
however,
the
jury
is--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--there
was
evidence
that
petitioner
was
involved
in
other
activity
which
could
support
the
other
three
charges.
however,
as
to
the
conspiracy
to
import
charge,
count
i,
the
jury's
first
note
during
deliberations
was
whether
or
not
they
could
consider
the
neah
bay
incident
as
part
of
the
conspiracy
to
import,
since
it
wasn't
alleged
in
the
indictment.
and
the
district
court
sent
a
note
back
in
the
affirmative
indicating
that
it
could
consider
the
neah
bay
information.
our
position
is,
as
i
will
get
to
in
a
few
minutes,
is
petitioner
was
convicted
of
the
conspiracy
to
import
marijuana
because
of
the
importation
of
marijuana
being
introduced
in
this
particular
trial.
when
you
get
into
a
conspiracy
charge,
as
two
of
these
were,
with
evidence
five
or
six
years
old,
sometimes
a
jury
can
focus
on
the
most
recent
evidence,
the
most
tangible
evidence
as
the
evidence
most
persuasive
to
convict.
but
again,
this
is
all
speculation.
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
did
except
from
the
notes
that
came
out,
the
specific
note
asking
about
neah
bay.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
i
believe
it
was
offered
as
to
the
conspiracy
of
the
import
count
also.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
court
judge,
when
the
sun
chaser
iii
testimony
was
introduced,
indicated
to
the
jury
that
that
testimony
regarding
the
sun
chaser
iii
and
seattle,
et
cetera,
was
only
being
introduced
for
the
purposes
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
itself,
and
was
not
related
to
the
other
defendant.
now
whether
or
not
the
jury
listened
to
that
evidence--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--if
there
was
evidence
that
the
jury
did
not
consider
the
neah
bay
evidence,
i
would
agree
that
those
three
would
be
sufficient.
however,
the
record
is
tainted
because
of
the
introduction
of
this
evidence.
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
40
years
imprisonment
and
a
maximum
$100,000
fine,
both
of
which
were
to
run
consecutive
to
the
washington
state
sentence
and
fine
that
he
had
previously
received.
relying
upon
fifth
circuit
precedence,
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
denied
petitioner's
argument
that
the
substantive
offense
of
importation
of
marijuana
was
a
lesser
included
offense
and
therefore
barred
the
substantive
offense
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
it
is
our
position
in
this
court,
as
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
continuing
criminal
enterprise
is
a
substantive
offense
which
in
petitioner's
case
has
been
improperly
segmented
by
the
prosecution
to
impermissibly
twice
prosecute
and
punish
petitioner
for
the
same
conduct.
although
this
court
in
jeffers
and
subsequently
some
circuits
have
alluded
to
the
fact
that
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
is
a
conspiracy
type
offense,
it
cannot
be
a
conspiracy
offense
because
of
its
very
elements.
those
elements
require
prosecution
and
punishment
of
the
completed
criminal
activity,
which
a
conspiracy
does
not.
a
conspiracy
is
merely
an
agreement
being
an
inchoate
crime.
and
that
agreement...
and
the
conspiracy
is
complete
when
the
agreement
is
complete.
cce
necessarily
includes
as
one
of
its
definitional
elements,
however,
the
element
of
in-concert
activity
which
this
court
discussed
in
jeffers.
this
connotes
cooperative
action.
that
element
is
present
whenever
a
cce
defendant
combines
with
others
in
concert
to
commit
a
crime,
those
predicate
violations.
in
addition
to
the
concerted
activity
element,
congress
intended
and
did
proscribe
through
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
against
the
comprehensive
and
continuing
business
of
drug
activity,
and
not
just
a
segment
of
that
activity
which
is
found
in
the
other
drug
felonies
in
both
subchapters.
mr.
justice
brennan
when
you
asked
me
your
question
regarding
whether
or
not
this
evidence
would
be
tainted
without
the
neah
bay
prosecution,
i
gave
you
an
answer
which
was
wrong.
the
answer
to
your
question
is:
the
evidence
would
be
tainted
under
my
argument
because
the
government
has
segmented
a
petitioner's
conduct.
my
argument
is
that
there
is
a
conspiracy
from
july...
or
january
1976
until
july
1981
in
florida
which
alleges
to
be
the
continuum
of
conduct
that
this
defendant
committed;
and
by
segmenting
part
of
that
activity,
by
choosing
to
prosecute
part
of
that
substantive
offense
in
washington,
is
impermissible
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
my
position
would
be
that,
since
it
is
a
substantive
offense
which
is
defined
by
the
indictment,
the
answer
would
be
no.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
could
not.
for
the
very
same
reasons
that
this
court
over
a
century
has
held
in
in
re
nielsen,
and
in
re
snow,
and
in
other
cases
that
it
is
a
continuing
offense...
the
business
of
drug
activity
is
a
proscribed
course
of
conduct.
segmenting
up
a
part
of
that
continuum
is
improper.
congress
has
proscribed
not
against
the
individual
drug
felonies
themselves--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--if
it
never
happened,
then--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--yes.
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
they
didn't
have
to
introduce
the
evidence,
your
honor.
what
they
didn't
have
to
do
was
to
prosecute
them
twice.
they
prosecuted
him
once
for
the
lesser
included
offense
of
importation
of
marijuana;
then
they
prosecuted
him
a
second
time
for
the
greater
offense--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--well,
my
position
is
that
they
could
not
prosecute
him
in
either
case
because
you
are
segmenting
up
a
substantive
violation
into
more
than
one
unit
of
prosecution.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
yes,
your
honor.
they
could
have
prosecuted
him
for
a
conspiracy
to
import.
they
could
have
prosecuted
him
for
a
conspiracy
to
possess
with
intent
to
distribute.
they
could
have
prosecuted--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--consecutive
to
the
washington
importation.
that
gets
to
the
cumulative
punishment
issue.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
he
pled
guilty
in
washington
to
the
importation
of
marijuana
charge.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
yes.
under
albernaz
they
can
convict
him
of
conspiracy,
and
they
can
convict
him
of
the
substantive
offense.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
yes.
that's
clear
from
albernaz
and
other
cases
that
he
can
be
indicted
and
convicted
of
the
conspiracy
and
of
the
substantive
offense.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
it
is
not
a
conspiracy
charge.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
it
requires
concerted
activity,
but
if
it
takes
an
agreement,
who
is
the
cce
defendant
conspiring
with
who
has
the
same
intent
that
he
does?
and
if
that
person
has
that
same
intent,
that
makes
that
person--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--five
or
more
persons.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
but
those
are
not
cce
defendants
themselves.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
then
he
could
be
charged
with
conspiracy.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
it
means
a
continuum
of
activity.
it
means
getting
other
people
to
aid
you.
in
our
opening
brief
we
talked
about
aiders
and
abettors.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
yes,
but
if
they
were
all
doing
what
a
continuing
enterprise
defendant
was
doing,
under
the
normal
rules
of
a
conspiracy
they
would
be
conspirators
with
a
cce
defendant,
and
they
cannot
be
guilty
of
conspiracy
because
they
cannot
have
committed
the
same
offense
that
a
cce
defendant
commits.
that
is,
supervising,
organizing,
substantial
resources.
so
if
we're
talking
about
conspiracy
being
a
specific-intent
offense,
which
it
is,
he
cannot
specifically
intend
to
commit
that
offense
with
five
underlings
because
they
do
not
have
the
same
specific
intent
to
organize,
supervise,
obtain
substantial
resources
in
money,
commit
a
continuing
series
of
violations,
as
that
continuing
criminal
enterprise
defendant
does.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
because
you
would
need
an
agreement
between
the
cce
defendant
and
another
to
commit
the
cce.
and
you
can't
have
an
agreement
with
the
underlings
to
commit
the
cce.
you
can
have
them
aid
you
in
part
of
that
agreement.
we
cited
united
states
vs.
tarr,
a
case
which
points
out
in
our
opening
brief
that
perhaps
an
aider
and
abettor
can
aid
and
abet
part
of
that
continuing
violation--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--you
need
to
necessarily
include
it.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
you
need
three
completed
crimes;
and
a
conspiracy,
by
definition,
is
an
inchoate--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--yes.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
all
you
need
is
an
agreement
with
a
conspiracy.
that
leads
back
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
idea
about
whether
or
not
these
are
sufficient
in
themselves
to
convict
for
the
cce.
if
the
conspiracies
are
just
agreements
that
don't
by
themselves
culminate
in
the
cce
defendant
getting
substantial
resources,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
they're
just
agreements.
if
the
jury
finds
that
he
conspired
but
didn't
make
any
money,
that's
not
enough.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
why
can't
the
cce
be
treated
as
a
conspiracy?
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
because
you
can't
agree
with
the
other
five
underlings
to
commit
a
cce
conspiracy.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
i
think
the
ultimate
answer
is,
it's
both.
it's
fish
and
fowl
at
the
same
time.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
you
do
have
to
prove
the
predicate
offenses
and
it
makes
it
a
completed
offense.
but
because
of
the
in-concert
activity
element,
you
have
to
do
it
with
other
people,
which
is
what
jeffers
basically
discussed.
in
order
to
commit
this
crime,
you
can't
do
it
alone.
and
what
congress
proscribed
as
the
allowable
unit
of
prosecution
is
the
business
of
drug
dealing.
not
an
individual
going
out
and
smuggling
or
doing
something
else
alone
and
making
millions
of
dollars,
but
the
business...
unlike
albernaz
which
the
two
conspiracies,
the
conspiracy
to
import
and
the
conspiracy
to
possess
with
intent
to
distribute,
are
punishing
two
separate
evils...
cce
is
parsing
the
entirety
of
drug
dealing.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
my
problem
is
it
becomes--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--yes.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
it
is
an
agreement;
it
is
a
completed
offense
once
there's
an
agreement.
the
jury
could
have
found
that
these
two
conspiracies
were
in
effect
existing,
but
then
they
would
have
to
make--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--they
could
be
predicate
offenses.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
but
they
have
to
find
that
there's
substantial
resources
obtained;
that
he
was
an
organizer
in
those
conspiracies...
the
problem
is,
there
was
a
motion
for
bill
of
particulars
in
this
case
to
find
out
what
the
particulars
were
about
the
government's
theory.
the
government
came
back...
you'll
look
at
the
cce
indictment
itself,
and
it
basically
only
indicates
that
he
is
charged
with
a
cce.
and
the
government
said--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--there
might
not.
however--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--well,
my
argument
basically--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--no,
your
honor.
you
cannot
just
convict
for
that
and
make
it
admissible,
if
you're
saying
including
the
neah
bay
evidence--
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
--yes.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
but
not
under
the
cce.
you
can
charge
him
for
separate
offenses
all
over
and
cumulate
the
punishments.
that's
clear.
but
the
cce
charge
is
meant
to
be
a
comprehensive
statute.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
yes,
because
the
conspiracy
is
different
than
the
washington
evidence.
but
that's
not
the
situation
we
had
here.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
minutes
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
the
solicitor
general
indicates
that
jeffers
conspiracy
is
not
one
of
the
predicates
of
the
prosecution
in
jeffers.
if
that
were
so,
then
they
would
be
separate
offenses.
if
that
were
so,
there
would
be
no
necessity
to
have
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
as
was
indicated
by
justice
blackmun
in
his
decision
that
lesser
included
offenses
instructions
would
be
warranted
in
that
case.
there
was
a
citation
of
kiebel,
and
there
were
other
citations
after
kiebel
from
jeffers
which
indicate
that
you
don't
just
look
at
the
statutory
elements
of
the
crime
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
is
warranted,
but
you
look
at
whether
or
not
the
evidence
warrants
those
instructions.
two
of
those
cases
are
beck
vs.
alabama,
and
hopper
vs.
evans.
those
cases
indicate
that
you
look
at
the
underlying
facts
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
is
warranted
in
a
case.
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
if
the
evidence
is
relied
upon
by
the
prosecution
to
prove
the
greater
offense,
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge,
and
it's
warranted
by
the
evidence,
that
if
lesser
included
offense
instructions
are
warranted,
then
they
must
be
given.
that
does
not
make
a
cce
a
separate
offense.
you
cannot
have
a
cce
offense
without
having
its
necessarily
included
lesser
offenses.
now
those
lesser
offenses
are
felonies,
that's
to
be
sure,
in
this
case;
they're
not
misdemeanors
as
you
normally
find
in
statutes;
but
because
of
the
punishment
aspect
of
cce,
you
get
a
tremendous
lever
with
this
type
of
punishment
over
a
defendant.
in
this
case,
40
years.
no
parole,
no
probation.
if
congress,
as
congress
intended
and
did,
intended
to
proscribe
against
the
business
of
drug
dealing,
then
this
type
of
statute
with
its
underlying
felonies
is
necessary
in
order
to
prove
that
greater
statutory
violation,
you
need
to
prove
the
lesser
included
offenses.
in
this
case,
you
can
tell
from
just
the
initial
indictment
in
seattle
when
petitioner
was
not
charged
with
a
conspiracy
in
seattle,
that
the
government
clearly
knew
that
it
was
one
offense
that
they
were
prosecuting.
he
was
not
charged
in
count
i
of
that
conspiracy
because,
frankly,
the
government
read
jeffers
several
years
later
after
jeffers
came
out
and
concluded
that
cce
was
a
conspiracy
offense.
and
because
other
circuit
courts
have
been
stating
that
846
and
963
are
conspiracies,
and
therefore
since
jeffers
says
848
is
a
conspiracy
offense,
we're
not
going
to
allege
conspiracies
involving
the
same
indictment
for
the
same
conduct
because
the
defendant
would
plead
to
the
conspiracy
and
buy
the
848
charge.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
because,
in
order
to
have
an
habitual
offender
statute
or
a
recedivist
statute,
you
are
putting
an
offender
who
is
offending
more
than
once
on
notice
by
his
prior
convictions
for
nonrelated
offenses
that
his
subsequent
act
and
subsequent
conduct
in
a
new
offense
unrelated
to
his
prior
offenses
is
going
to
cumulatively
punish
him,
is
going
to
greater
punish
him
for
the
new
offense.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
it
does.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
a.
demassa
well,
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
in
the
recidivist
area
clearly
indicate
that
the
purpose
for
recidivist
statutes
are,
once
a
person
has
been
burned
once,
he
is
on
notice
that
he
can't
continue
that
conduct.
but
there's
no
burning
once
in
a
cce
indictment.
there's
no
conviction...
three
convictions,
and
then
you're
out
of
the
ballgame;
three
convictions,
and
now
you're
a
cce
defendant.
you've
got
to
commit
these
over
a
continuing
period
of
time,
not
just
once.
in
any
event,
the
habitual
offenders
i
think
are
analogized
the
same
way.
there's
just
no
comparison
between
those
and
a
cce
offense.
by
the
way,
if
the
government's
impression
regarding
jeffers
and
the
lesser
included
offenses
was
correct,
then
iannelli
would
control
the
case,
as
mr.
justice
white
ruled
or
held
in
the
jeffers
case,
and
that's
clearly
not
the
case
here.
you
cannot
make
the
greater
offense
without
the
lesser
included
offenses
also
being
made.
therefore,
they
are
necessarily
included,
and
the
evidence
would
warrant
them
being
held
that
way.
the
illinois
vs.
vitalle,
the
government
argues
that
there
is
not
a
same-transaction
test,
but
what
happened
in
that
case?
the
court
basically
looked
at
the
facts
of
the
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
substantial
claim.
it
was
remanded
to
the
illinois
courts
for
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
failure
to
slow
was
a
lesser
included
offense
or
necessarily
required
to
prove
the
greater.
it's
the
same
situation
here.
again,
you
get
back
to
the
continuum
of
conduct.
it's
a
continuing
substantive
violation.
by
segmenting
out
petitioner's
conduct
in
washington
when
the
government
knew
it
was
going
to
prosecute
petitioner
in
florida
for
the
same
offense,
they
committed
all
those
violations
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
which
petitioner
had
a
right
to
be
protected
from,
including
a
right
to
be
protected
from
cumulative
punishment
for
the
same
conduct.
