justice
jr.
well,
was
there
other
evidence
limited
just
on
the
florida
charges?
justice
jr.
limited
to
activity
and
conduct
in
florida?
justice
jr.
independently
of
the
evidence
that
you
tell
us
came
from
the
washington
inquiry?
justice
jr.
there
could
have
been
a
conviction
of
these
three
without
reference
to
the
washington
material?
justice
jr.
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
cce
charge;
the
three
independent...
the
two
conspiracies
and
the
telephone
counts.
was
there
evidence,
independently
of
what
went
on
in
washington,
which
would
have
supported
those
convictions?
justice
jr.
well,
did
the
government
offer
all
this
washington
state
evidence
affirmatively
in
support
of
the
independent
charges
outside
of
the
cce?
justice
jr.
did
they
say
it
was?
justice
jr.
well,
would
you
agree,
if
none
of
the
three
charges
was
tainted
by
any
of
the
washington
evidence,
that
they
might
support
the
conviction
on
the
cce
count...
the
conviction
on
the
florida
three
would
be
enough
to
support
conviction
on
the
cce
charge?
justice
jr.
well,
i
come
back
then
to
the
question
i
asked
you
earlier.
could
not
the
government
have
prosecuted
all
four
of
the
charges
in
florida--
justice
jr.
--without
reference
to
what
went
on
in
the
state
of
washington?
justice
jr.
it
could
not?
justice
jr.
let's
suppose
what
happened
in
washington
never
happened--
justice
jr.
--then
would
the
charges
made
in
florida
have
sufficed?
justice
jr.
but
because
something
did
happen
in
washington,
they
had
to
introduce
all
of
that
evidence
to
prove
the
continuum.
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
as
i
understand
you,
they
could
not
have
prosecuted
him
after
they
did
in
washington,
they
could
not
prosecute
him
in
florida
without
introducing
the
washington
evidence.
justice
jr.
now
this
you
are
applying
only
to
the
cce
count?
justice
jr.
he
was
sentenced
to
40
years
on
the
cce
count?
justice
jr.
but
you
also
argue,
do
you,
that
the
conspiracy
counts
here...
even
if
there
were
nothing
about
washington
involved
in
this
case...
could
not
be
predicate
offenses
for
the
cce
count?
justice
jr.
don't
you
argue
that?
justice
jr.
you
say,
a
conspiracy
conviction
is
not
a
completed
offense.
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
well,
could
they
then
be
predicate
offenses?
justice
jr.
all
right.
justice
jr.
and
i
gather
that
you'd
argue
there
was
absolutely
no
taint
by
the
washington
evidence
of
the
florida
substantive
offense
part
of
it.
that's
his
secondary...
that's
your
secondary.
justice
jr.
well,
they
relied
on
nielson,
i
think,
didn't
they?
justice
jr.
well,
nielson
antedated
blockburger
by
decades,
didn't
it?
