justice
o'connor
mr.
demassa,
may
i
inquire
about
the
nature
of
the
proof
in
florida
of
the
washington
offense?
was
the
evidence
of
the
conviction
in
washington
introduced?
justice
o'connor
and
was
it
simply
an
introduction
of
the
portion
of
the
same
evidence
which
had
been
introduced
previously
in
washington?
or
what
was
done?
justice
o'connor
do
some
states
have
such
crimes
on
the
books
for
habitual
offenders?
justice
o'connor
--but
they
nevertheless
allow
proof
of
the
previous
convictions.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
levy,
what
if
the
defendant
had
gone
to
trial
in
washington
on
the
importation
of
marijuana
offense
and
been
acquitted?
could
the
government,
nonetheless,
introduce
the
same
evidence
later
on
in
florida
in
support
of
the
cce?
justice
o'connor
why?
justice
o'connor
nothing
to
do
with
double
jeopardy?
justice
o'connor
could
you
use
the
same
evidence
to
support
other
aspects,
such
as
the
association
with
five
or
more
people--
justice
o'connor
--or
something
of
that
sort?
or,
to
prove
conspiracy.
justice
o'connor
but
jeffers,
the
jeffers
vs.
united
states
case,
determined
that
congress
did
not
intend
cumulative
penalties
to
be--
justice
o'connor
why
isn't
the
cce
statute
analogous
to
an
habitual
offender
statute?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
doesn't
this
statute
put
a
defendant
on
notice
that
if
he
continues
to
commit
drug
offenses,
he
might
be
charged
with--
justice
o'connor
--continuing
criminal
enterprise?
