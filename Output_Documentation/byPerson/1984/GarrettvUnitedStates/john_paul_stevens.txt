justice
stevens
i
thought
he
originally
conceded
that
and
then
walked
away
from
that
concession.
justice
stevens
i
had
thought
that
before
argument,
but
i
think
he
changed
his
position
today.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
levy,
just
to
get
it
out
early,
supposing...
unlike
the
facts
of
this
case...
you
had
only
two
other
substantive
offenses
that
could
be
proved
in
florida
instead
of
the
multiple
group
you
have,
would
your
position
be
the
same?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
you
had
only
three
predicate
offenses,
one
of
which
was
the
washington
situation,
would
you
still
make
the
same
argument?
justice
stevens
well,
if
all
three
of
the
predicate
offenses
you
sought
to
prove
in
florida
had
been
previously
prosecuted,
you
would
make
the
same
argument?
justice
stevens
mr.
levy,
is
that
a
valid
argument?
didn't
one
of
our
opinions
expressly
make
an
exception
for
later
discovered
evidence
and
later
transactions?
justice
stevens
i
thought
your
argument
basically
was,
even
if
the
government
is
aware
of
the
whole
panorama
of
activities,
it
can
still
divide
up
the
prosecution
in
this
way.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
well,
in
that
case,
our
cases
have
suggested
there's
an
exception
to
the
rule.
justice
stevens
i'm
surprised
you
start
out
with
that
argument.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
your
hypothetical
here
is
assuming
many
more
than
three
predicate
offenses.
there
there
is
no
problem
with
blockburger.
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
has
to
focus
on
the
question
whether
if
you
are
required
to
prove
three,
and
one
of
the
three
has
already
been
proved.
justice
stevens
you
see,
your
hypothetical
is
you
say
you've
got
myriad
offenses,
and
obviously
you
have
no
problem
in
that
case.
justice
stevens
then
under
that
argument,
blockburger
is
satisfied.
that's
not
an
argument
against
applying
blockburger.
justice
stevens
well,
you
clearly
would
have
avoided
the
problem
with
this
case,
would
you
not,
if
the
trial
judge
had
said:
you
must
find
three
predicate
offenses,
but
don't
use
the
incident
in
seattle
as
one
of
the
three?
justice
stevens
that
clearly
would
have
avoided
the
whole
problem.
justice
stevens
and
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you
could
easily
have
won
the
case
under
such
an
instruction.
justice
stevens
well,
isn't
it
true
that
whenever
the
government
established
the
cce
it
would
necessarily
establish
three
predicate
offenses?
justice
stevens
well,
but
in
murder
and
manslaughter,
maybe
the
manslaughter
charge
was
somebody
else.
theoretically
you
can
have
a
murder
of
a
and
a
manslaughter
of
b.
justice
stevens
and
if
you
have
a
cce,
you
will
necessarily
have
three
predicate
offenses.
justice
stevens
mr.
levy,
manslaughter
won't
always
involve
an
automobile.
justice
stevens
the
charge,
or
the
statute?
justice
stevens
mr.
levy,
can
i
go
back
to
justice
white's
hypothetical
suggesting
that
you
always
look
at
the
lesser
included
issue
when
the
minor
offense
is
committed.
suppose
you
go
into
a
store
and
commit
a
robbery.
you've
committed
the
robbery.
then
ten
minutes
later
you
kill
the
proprietor.
therefore,
you
have
felony
murder.
do
you
not
have
to
look
at
it
at
the
time
that
the
greater
offense
is
committed
because
there's
no
lesser
included
offense
when
he
first
went
in
and
held
him
up?
justice
stevens
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
in
order
to
make
the
analysis
all
of
the
offenses
that
you
are
comparing
have
to
have
been
committed
at
the
time
you
make
the
comparison.
and
in
this
case,
the
three
presumably
predicate
offenses
would
have
taken
place
before
he
was
indicted
for
cce.
justice
stevens
and
the
government
would
know
it.
justice
stevens
but
what
is
the
difference
between
using
the
unit
of
transaction,
the
whole
event
in
the
store
robbery
that
i
described,
or
the
unit
of
transaction
as
three
drug
offenses
followed
by
everything
else
you
need
to
commit
the
cce?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
difference?
justice
stevens
does
it
have
a
role...
well,
go
ahead.
you
finish.
justice
stevens
and
the
greater
is
not
completed
until
the
ten-minute
period
has
expired--
justice
stevens
--and
here
with
this
offense
it
takes
maybe
six
months
instead
of
ten
minutes.
justice
stevens
so
is
there
a
constitutional
difference
between
six
months
and
ten
minutes?
justice
stevens
what
about
a
kidnapping?
you
hold
the
person
for
six
months
and
then
kill
him.
justice
stevens
yes,
and
i'm
talking
then
it's
a
felony...
and
it
becomes
a
murder
at
the
time
of
the
felony
murder
at
the
time
of
the
killing.
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
have
a
lesser
included
offense
until
the
end
of
the
six
months,
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
stevens
why
is
it
different?
justice
stevens
six
months,
in
both
cases.
justice
stevens
well,
an
accidental
killing
at
the
end
of
a
six-month
period
of
kidnapping
someone
would
be
a
felony
murder.
justice
stevens
--might
not
be
a
murder
without
the
kidnapping,
and
the
greater
offense
is
the
murder,
and
the
lesser
included
offense
is
the
kidnapping.
am
i
incorrect?
justice
stevens
your
position
really
requires
us
to
overrule
the
cases
you
discussed
in
that
one
footnote,
hayes,
and
one
other.
justice
stevens
harris.
harris
against
oklahoma.
you
would
require
overruling
of
that
case.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
right
there,
you're
saying
that
it
could
not
contend,
for
example
in
this
case,
that
cce
is
an
aggravated
form
of
the
offense
committed
in
seattle?
