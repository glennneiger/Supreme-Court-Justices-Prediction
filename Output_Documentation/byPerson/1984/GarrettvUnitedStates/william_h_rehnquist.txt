tell
me
again,
mr.
demassa,
your
answer
to
justice
white's
question
conceding
that
the
cce
offense,
because
it
involved
underlings
rather
than
conspirators,
is
not
the
same
as
a
conspiracy.
why
can't
it
be
treated
the
same
for
purposes
of
the
legal
arguments
you're
making?
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
far
as
the
kind
of
arguments
you're
making.
justice
rehnquist
that
i
realizes
distinguishes
it
from
a
conspiracy,
so
it's
a
rather
than
b.
but
why
can't
both
a
and
b
be
treated
the
same
for
purposes
of
the
kind
of
double
jeopardy
legal
argument
you're
making?
justice
rehnquist
well,
blockburger
really
didn't
advance
any
double
jeopardy
analysis
at
all.
it
was
a
statutory
case.
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
think
the
word
mr.
levy?
do
you
think
"colorable",
"proven"?
justice
rehnquist
well,
notice
is
more
of
a
due
process
concept.
i
never
heard
of
notice
associated
with
a
double
jeopardy
argument.
