mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
saying
that
in
our
view
this
case
doesn't
involve
any
segmenting
or
unit
of
prosecution
issue.
that
issue
would
come
up
if
the
government
had
sought
to
take
a
single
continuing
criminal
enterprise
and
divide
it
for
purposes
of
prosecution
and
sentence.
that
is
not
what
is
done
here.
the
unit
of
prosecution
issue,
first
of
all,
would
be
an
issue
of
statutory
intent,
not
a
double
jeopardy
issue
at
all,
and
the
only
issue
that
petitioner
has
raised
is
a
double
jeopardy
issue,
not
a
unit
of
prosecution
issue.
so
let
me
turn
to
the
double
jeopardy
question.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
successive
prosecutions
for
the
same
offense.
now
under
this
principle,
petitioner
does
not
dispute
that
he
was
subject
to
successive
prosecutions
for
his
various
substantive
drug
offenses,
no
matter
how
many
there
were,
no
matter
where
around
the
country
they
were
brought,
no
matter
what
the
evidence
might
have
been
that
the
government
actually
used
in
each
of
those
prosecutions;
nor
does
he
dispute
that
he
was
subject
to
successive
prosecutions
for
substantive
offenses
and
for
conspiracy.
so
that,
as
he
conceded
just
a
moment
ago,
he
could
have
been
tried
on
substantive
offenses
and
a
conspiracy
offense
could
later
have
been
brought
in
florida,
and
a
conspiracy
offense
could
have
used
much
or
all
of
the
same
evidence
that
the
government
had
previously
relied
on
in
the
substantive
prosecutions.
he
also
does
not
dispute
that
he
was
subject
to
a
cce
prosecution
in
florida
following
the
washington
importation
prosecution,
provided
only
that
the
washington
importation
was
not
used
as
part
of
the
government's
proof
of
the
series
of
drug
violations.
so
the
issue
in
this
case,
therefore--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
perhaps
your
understanding
is
better
than
mine,
but
my
understanding
is
what
i
just
stated.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but
the
central
question
here
is
whether
importation
of
marijuana
and
continuing
criminal
enterprise
become
the
same
offense
because
that
importation
is
used
in
a
given
case
as
one
of
the
predicates
for
cce.
now
we
submit
the
petitioner's
importation
of
marijuana
in
washington
on
august
26th,
1980,
was
not
the
same
offense
as
his
continuing
criminal
enterprise
that
occurred
around
the
country
in
at
least
eight
states
that
lasted
for
more
than
half
a
decade
and
that
involved
numerous
criminal
activities.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
our
principal
position
would
be
the
same
there--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--our
principal
argument
would
be
the
same.
that
is,
that
substantive
predicates
and
cce
are
not
the
same
offense.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
our
argument
would
indeed
be
the
same.
but
we
also
have
an
additional
argument
in
this
case.
that
is,
whatever
the
general
relationship
between
predicates
and
cce,
in
this
case
petitioner's
conviction
should
not
be
reversed
because
of
the
presence
of
the
three
other
convictions
in
florida
that
suffice
to
sustain
the
cce
conviction.
so
we
have
two
levels
of
argument.
but
our
principal
argument,
justice
stevens
and
justice
white,
would
be
the
same.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
secondary,
but
that
is
also
part
of
our
principal
argument.
there
is
indeed
no
taint.
as
petitioner
conceded,
he
could
be
prosecuted
in
florida
for
conspiracy,
and
the
neah
bay
evidence
could
be
admitted.
and
the
conspiracy,
he
also
admits,
could
be
used
as
one
of
the
predicates.
so
we
think
there
is
no
taint
from
the
use
of
the
neah
bay
evidence.
now
before
turning
to
the
analytical
framework
for
resolving
the
double
jeopardy
issue,
let
me
first
discuss
briefly
some
of
the
consequences
of
petitioner's
argument.
consider
a
defendant
who
is
apprehended
in
the
commission
of
a
drug
offense.
assume
that
he
is
prosecuted
and
convicted
for
that
substantive
drug
offense,
and
that
it
later
turns
out
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
under
petitioner's
theory,
the
government
might
not
be
able
to
bring
a
cce
case
at
all.
and
even
if
it
could,
it
would
not
be
able
to
present
its
complete
cce
case
because
the
previously
prosecuted
offense
would
have
to
be
excluded.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
is
an
exception
for
that,
but
we
think
this
case
goes
well
beyond
that,
and
that
that's
appropriate
in
light
of
the
nature
of
the
cce
offense.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
take
that
position--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--but
in
most
cases,
it
will
in
fact
be
the
situation
that
the
government
is
not
aware
of
that
situation.
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
understand--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--there
is,
although
that
exception
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
apply
in
practice.
it
is
one
that
we
think
is
appropriately
recognized
and
in
suitable
cases
the
government
will
apply
it.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
just
simply
want
to
give
the
court
some
idea
of
the
practical
dimensions
of
the
petitioner's
argument.
i
think
that
it
would
have
very
unsound
application
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
let
me
give
another
example.
that
is
a
case
like
the
first
circuit's
decision
in
middleton
upon
which
petitioner
relies,
where
the
cce
prosecution
is
brought
first
and
the
defendant
is
acquitted.
suppose
it
is
clear
that
the
reason
for
the
cce
acquittal
is
that
five
or
more
other
people
were
involved
but
that
the
defendant
did
not
obtain
substantial
income
or
resources.
under
petitioner's
theory,
the
defendant
would
be
immune
from
a
substantive
prosecution
even
though
the
government's
evidence
was
ample
to
show,
as
one
of
the
cce
predicates,
the
defendant
committed
that
offense.
these
would
lead
to
very
substantial
windfalls
for
drug
defendants.
now
what
arguments
have
been
advanced
to
support
those
windfalls?
basically
there
are
two:
the
blockburger
test,
and
the
same-facts
test.
let
me
start
with
blockburger.
blockburger
was
designed
to
determine
whether
violations
of
two
statutory
provisions
arising
from
the
same
act
or
transaction
are
the
same
offense
in
the
sense
of
having
a
certain
logical
and
necessary
relation
to
each
other.
that
is,
whether
the
elements
of
one
are
identical
to
or
entirely
subsumed
in
the
elements
of
the
other.
so
that
whenever
the
government
establishes
one
offense,
it
always
necessarily
and
invariably
establishes
that
other
offense
as
well.
this
blockburger
relation
identifies
the
offenses
as
true
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses,
and
thus
has
the
same
offense
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
now
blockburger
is
simply
unhelpful
in
analyzing
the
quite
different
issue
of
the
relation
between
a
compound
offense
such
as
cce
or
rico
and
its
underlying
predicate
offenses.
the
offenses
used
as
the
multiple
predicates
for
cce
are
not
lesser
included
offenses,
because
no
particular
or
specific
offense
is
a
necessary
component
of
the
compound
cce
offense.
rather,
any
of
a
number
of
offenses
can
serve
as
predicates,
and
the
actual
predicates
will
vary
from
case
to
case.
moreover,
cce
and
its
predicates
do
not
involve
the
same
act
or
transaction:
rather,
they
arise
from
an
extensive
course
of
criminal
conduct.
in
this
case,
for
example,
petitioner's
continuing
criminal
enterprise
occurred
over
a
five-year
period.
it
extended
to
at
least
eight
different
states.
it
included
numerous
participants,
and
involved
myriad
criminal
activities.
now
in
these
circumstances,
application
of
the
blockburger
standard
is
irresolvably
indeterminate.
it
tells
us
nothing
about
the
relation
between
the
compound
offense
and
the
predicate
offense.
we
believe
blockburger
is
not
an
end
in
itself,
but
instead
is
a
means
of
sound
analysis
for
the
same
offense
question,
and
it
has
no
applicability--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--all
right,
we
would
take
the
position
that
that
does
not
violate
double
jeopardy.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
wasn't
a
hypothetical;
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case:
that
the
petitioner
engaged
in
myriad
criminal
activities.
the
reason
i
mentioned
that
was
to
show
that
it
is
not
the
same
act
or
transaction.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
don't
think
it
can
be
said
in
the
area
of
compound
and
predicate
offenses
that
blockburger
is
either
satisfied
or
not
satisfied;
or,
alternatively,
it
is
satisfied
and
not
satisfied
at
the
same
time.
we
just
don't
think
blockburger
can
be
applied
in
any
meaningful
way
to
compound
and
predicate
offenses.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
at
a
minimum,
that
would
have
avoided
double
jeopardy.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but
the
reason
for
that
is--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--we
could
have
in
this
case,
but
we
don't
think
it
was
necessary
that
such
an
instruction
be
given
because
the
predicate
offenses
and
cce
are
the
same.
but
to
determine
whether
they're
the
same
or
not
can't
be
done
under
the
blockburger
test.
if
you're
going
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
are
the
same...
and
we
think
they
are
not...
but
if
you
come
to
the
conclusion
they
are
the
same,
you
have
to
get
there
by
some
means
other
than
blockburger.
applying
the
elements'
test
of
blockburger
to
compound
and
predicate
offenses
for
any
of
a
number
of
different
offenses
under
the
statute
could
serve
as
predicates.
under
the
cce
statute,
importation
can
serve
as
a
predicate,
distribution,
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
conspiracy,
and
a
whole
range
of
offenses
can
serve
as
predicates.
now
in
a
particular
case
there
may
only
be
three
predicates
that
the
government
chooses...
or
is
able
to
prove,
but
any
of
a
number
of
offenses
can
be
predicates.
different
types
of
offenses
can
be
predicates.
therefore,
it
cannot
be
said
in
the
blockburger
sense
that
any
particular
type
of
offense
is
necessarily
included,
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
cce.
in
a
murder
and
manslaughter
cause,
for
example,
it
can
always
be
said
that
manslaughter
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
murder.
whenever
the
government
establishes
murder,
it
will
always
necessarily
and
invariably
establish
manslaughter.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
would
establish
three
predicates,
but
we
wouldn't
know
which
predicates,
and
they
would
be
different
for
each
case.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
you
could,
but
if
you
have
a
murder
of
a,
you
will
also
necessarily
have
a
manslaughter
of
a.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
you
will
have
three
predicates,
but
we
don't
think
those
predicates
will
be
lesser
included
offenses
in
the
same
sense
of
murder
and
manslaughter,
or
armed
bank
robbery
and
bank
robbery,
and
the
other
kinds
of
traditional
lesser
and
greater
offenses
for
which
blockburger
was
designed
to
advance
the
double
jeopardy
analysis.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
relied
on
cases
such
as
gavayares.
there
was
a
double
jeopardy
issue,
and
the
court
has
subsequently
relied
on
blockburger
in
cases
like
brown
and
illinois
vs.
vitalle.
so
we
think
that
blockburger
has
taken
on
at
least
some
dimensions
of
a
constitutional
analysis
here.
but
whatever
its
status,
it
is
at
most
applicable
in
situations
where
it
makes
sense
to
apply
it,
where
it
advances
the
analysis
and
where
it
can
give
meaningful
results,
and
we
simply
don't
think
that
is
true
in
the
area
of
compound
and
predicate
offenses,
especially
offenses
like
cce
and
rico.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
let
me
say
first
that
cce
is
not
such
a
statute.
and,
second,
if
there
is
any--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--because
you
need
to
prove
a
great
many
other
things
than
simply
the
series
of
offenses.
you
need
to
prove
the
in
concert--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--with
respect
to
a
double
jeopardy
objection,
we
would.
there
may
be
other
problems
such
as
due
process.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
not
in
the
present
argument.
we
also
have
an
alternative
argument
that
cce
may
be
analogized
to
a
recedivist
or
an
habitual
offender
statute.
but
in
the
principal
argument,
i
don't
think
that
is
necessary.
but
we
would
take
the
position,
just
to
be
clear,
that
such
a
statute
would
not
violate
double
jeopardy--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
believe
that's
correct.
now
i
don't
know
that
some--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
am
not
aware
of
them,
but
i
can't
give
a
conclusive
answer
to
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct,
and
the
defendant
would
not
have
been
previously
prosecuted
for
the
one
that
is
at
issue.
that
is
the
more
traditional,
more
typical
habitual
offender
statute.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
they
do,
and
this
court
has
long
held
that
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
problem
with
such
a
statute.
now
petitioner
also
proposes
the
same
facts
test
for
double
jeopardy
analysis.
that
is,
offenses
are
the
same...
excuse
me,
where
the
facts
in
evidence
underlying
them
are
the
same.
but
this
court's
decisions
make
it
clear
that
double
jeopardy
does
not
turn
on
the
facts
or
the
evidence
actually
involved
in
the
particular
prosecution.
if
the
rule
were
otherwise,
conspiracy
in
a
substantive
offense,
for
example,
would
often
be
the
same
offense,
which
would
be
contrary
to
well
settled
double
jeopardy
principles.
or,
the
court's
analysis
in
brown
against
ohio
would
have
been
beside
the
point,
because
it
was
clear
that
the
two
offenses
there
involved
the
same
facts.
let
me
discuss
for
a
moment
illinois
against
vitalle.
we
believe
that
that
decision
does
not
establish
the
same-facts'
test.
vitalle
involves
successive
charges
of
failure
to
reduce
speed
and
involuntary
manslaughter
arising
out
of
a
traffic
accident.
because
involuntary
manslaughter
with
an
automobile
will
always
involve
some
underlying
traffic
offense...
whether
driving
while
intoxicated,
reckless
driving,
failure
to
slow,
or
something
else...
the
court
recognized
that
the
manslaughter
charge
was
a
form
of
compound
predicate
offense.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
but
i
think
the
illinois
charge
in
that
case
did
involve
manslaughter
with
an
automobile.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
the
statute
had
a
different
section
for
manslaughter
with
an
automobile
and
the
charge
was
brought
under
that.
that's
my
recollection.
but
we
think
vitalle
can
be
seen
to
rest
on
the
premise
that
manslaughter
with
an
automobile
may
be
an
aggravated
form
of
the
traffic
offense
where
death
ensues,
and
therefore
the
defendant's
claim
of
double
jeopardy
was
substantial.
indeed,
vitalle
explained
the
felony
murder
decision--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i'm
not
entirely
sure,
and
the
court
did
not
explain
it,
but
i
think
the
best
reading
is
that
the
court
couldn't
come
to
a
conclusive
determination
of
the
double
jeopardy
claim,
because
that
claim
turned
on
the
nature
of
the
state
law
offenses.
that
is,
whether
manslaughter
with
an
automobile
was
intended
by
the
legislature
to
be
an
aggravated
form
of
the
traffic
offense
where
a
death
ensued.
if
the
illinois
legislature
intended
that
manslaughter
was
an
aggravated
form
of
failure
to
slow
where
death
ensued,
then
a
defendant
would
have
not
just
a
substantial
claim
of
double
jeopardy
but
a
conclusive
claim.
but
the
court
was
unable
to
determine
that
because
the
issue
hadn't
been
briefed
and
decided
by
the
state
courts.
so
i
think
the
court's
use
of
the
word
"substantial"
indicated
that
there
was
a
basis
for
the
claim,
but
that
the
case
in
its
present
posture
couldn't
be
finally
resolved.
we
think
that
is
also
clear
from
the
court's
discussion
of
the
felony
murder
decision...
the
court's
discussion
in
vitalle
of
the
felony
murder
decision
in
harris
against
oklahoma.
the
court
in
vitalle
stated
that
harris
had
viewed
the
felony
murder...
had
viewed
killing
in
the
course
of
a
robbery
as
a
separate
statutory
offense,
and
that
the
robbery
was
a
lesser
included
offense
thereof.
in
other
words,
the
court
viewed
the
issue
in
harris
as
felony
murder
being
an
aggravated
form
of
the
underlying
felony.
that
would
make
them
the
same
offense
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
and
the
court's
view
of
the
felony
murder
statute
that
we
think
underlies
this
decision
in
harris
is
the
same
view
it
later
took
of
the
district
of
columbia
felony
murder
statute.
that
is,
that
is
was
an
aggravated
form
of
the
underlying
felony.
nothing
in
these
decisions
turns
on
the
facts
or
evidence
in
a
particular
case.
we
think
there
is
no
basis
for
petitioner's
advancing
a
same-facts'
test
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
now
if
blockburger
and
the
same-facts'
test
are
not
the
proper
standards
what
is
the
correct
approach
in
this
area
for
complex
compound-predicate
offenses
like
cce
and
rico?
we
submit
that
the
same-offense
question
can
be
answered
only
by
a
focused
and
concrete
examination
of
the
offenses
that
congress
has
created.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
recognizes
that
it
is
the
province
of
congress
to
prescribe
criminal
offenses,
and
it
does
not
limit
the
offenses
that
congress
can
define.
the
decisive
question,
therefore,
is
did
congress
create
separate
offenses?
now
in
effect,
this
is
what
the
blockburger
test
determines
in
the
area
in
which
it
is
applicable
to
true
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses.
where
blockburger
is
not
satisfied,
not
simply
that
it
can't
be
applied,
but
where
it
can
be
applied
and
is
not
satisfied,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
offenses
are
different
in
any
sense.
blockburger
thus
serves
as
a
shorthand
or
a
proxy
in
some
situations
for
evaluating
whether
the
legislatively
defined
offenses
are
the
same
or
different.
now
the
same
fundamental
inquiry
applies
for
more
complex
statutory
provisions
that
do
not
involve
true
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses
such
as
cce
or
rico.
but
there,
the
mechanistic
blockburger
test
cannot
be
used
as
a
surrogate
for
a
careful
examination
of
the
nature
of
the
offenses
defined
by
congress.
this
required
examination
turns
on
the
text
of
the
statutes,
their
legislative
history,
their
common
law
or
statutory
background,
the
societal
interests
and
legislative
policies
that
underlie
them,
and
any
other
considerations
that
inform
the
inquiry
into
the
character
and
substance
of
the
offenses
that
congress
has
prescribed.
now
applying
that
standard
here,
we
believe
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
create
cce
and
the
marijuana
importation
offense
as
the
same
offense.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
and,
we
submit,
even
when
the
third
one
happens
it
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense.
the
substantive
predicates
in
cce
are
not
in
any
circumstances
the
same
offense.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
right.
and
that's
the
kind
of
situation
that
blockburger
was
designed
to
deal
with,
we
think,
because
it
does
turn
on
the
nature
of
the
same
act
or
transaction,
where
that
has
occurred
at
that
instant
or
at
roughly
the
same
time
at
least,
it
will
be
known
whether
the
defendant
has
committed
the
greater
offense,
and
also
whether
he's
committed
the
truly
lesser
included
offense.
and
we
think
that
is
much
different
than
cce
or
rico.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
let
me
start
with
an
easier
answer.
that
is,
that
we
agree
that
the
government
would
not
be
able
to
use
that
offense
as
one
of
the
predicates
for
the
cce
offense.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
would
be
collateral
estoppel
or
res
judicata
in
the
truest
sense.
now
it
is
a
more
difficult
question--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--to
the
extent
that
those
concepts
are
embraced
in
double
jeopardy,
it
would
have
some
constitutional
basis;
but
it
is
not
the
same
kind
of
double
jeopardy
issue
that
we're
discussing
in
this
case.
it
is
a
harder
question
whether
the
government--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--our
position
is
that
we
could.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
certainly
to
prove
conspiracy
as
a
separate
offense
there
would
be
no
problem
with
that.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't
turn
on
the
evidence;
it
turns
on
the
same
offense.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
don't
think
the
same
act
or
transaction
requires
that
the
offenses
occur
at
the
exact
second,
but
we
do
think
that
they
need
to
occur--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--presumably
it
would.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
it
would
have
occurred,
but
we
think
it
is
fundamentally
different
to
say
that,
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
the
robbery
and
the
murder
occurred
in
the
same
course
of
criminal
conduct.
it's
something
else
to
say
that
a
criminal
act
that
may
have
occurred
years
earlier
in
an
entirely
different
jurisdiction--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--we
think
that
there
is
a
much
different--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
difference
is
the
nature
of
the
offenses
involved.
we
don't
think
that
the
same
act
or
transaction
test
is
the
double
jeopardy
standard,
but
we
think
it
has
some
role
to
play
in
defining
what
the
appropriate
standard
should
be.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
language
of
the
constitution
is
"same
offense".
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
two
offenses
that
occur
within
ten
minutes
of
each
other
in
the
same
course
of
criminal
conduct
in
the
same
episode--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that
may
be--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--six
months,
or
six
years--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
we
think
if
you're
looking
at
what
the
language
of
the
constitution's
"same
offense"
can
mean,
we
think
there
is
a
difference
between
offenses
that
may
occur
in
one
episode
ten
minutes
apart--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
the
kidnapping
is
a
continuing
thing.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
at
the
instant
at
which
you
kill
him,
you
are
still
guilty
of
kidnapping.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it's
different
because
in
its
nature
cce
does
not
occur
in
the
same
time
frame
in
the
same
place.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
in
your
hypothetical,
let
me
go
on
to
say,
we
don't
think
that
murder
and
kidnapping
would
be
the
same
offense
either.
we
think
those
are,
under
settled
principles,
different
offenses.
so
perhaps
i
didn't
fully
understand
the
point.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
that--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
in
our
analysis
we
think
you
are
incorrect,
that
the
kidnapping
would
not
be
a
lesser
included
offense
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
double
jeopardy
area.
"lesser
included
offenses",
as
we
understand
them,
are
offenses
that
always
occur
when
the
greater
offense
has
occurred.
we
the
think
the
court
made
that
clear,
for
example,
in
vitalle.
kidnapping
and
felony
murder
is
not
a
greater
and
lesser
included
offense
for
which
the
blockburger
analysis
was
designed.
it
is
a
compound
predicate
offense,
and
we
don't
think
it
can
be
said,
as
petitioner's
position
in
essence
comes
down
to,
that
all
compound
predicate
offenses
are
the
same
offense
regardless
of
their
elements,
regardless
of
what
the
legislature
intended,
and
so
on.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
sorry?
harris?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
believe
so,
although
those
opinions
were
quite
brief,
and
it
is
hard
to
know
exactly
the
basis
for
the
court's
decision,
but
we
think
they
can
be
most
sensibly
read
as
resting
on
the
premise
that
the
felony...
that
the
felony
murder
was
an
aggravated
form
of
the
underlying
felony
where
death
ensued,
which
is
what
the
court
later
actually
held
as
to
the
d.c.
felony
murder
statute
in
whelan,
and
it
is
also
the
explanation
that
the
court
gave
in
vitalle
for
the
harris
against
oklahoma
decision.
so
we
don't
think
our
decision
requires
that
those
cases
be
overruled.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
they
did
rely
on
nielson,
that's
correct,
and
nielson
is
a
case
that's
a
bit
hard
to
follow.
but
as
we
understand
it,
we
think
nielson
applied
the
blockburger
test
to
the
elements
of
the
offense,
but
that--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--in
its
formal
structure,
but
we
think
the
approach
they
followed
was
similar
to
what
was
later
adopted
in
blockburger,
and
that
the
difficulty
in
nielson
is
that
the
court
did
not
simply
look
at
the
elements
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
it
looked
at
the
statutory
elements
as
it
construed
them.
those
were
federal
statutes
involving
the
federal
territory
of
utah,
and
so
the
court
was
free
to
give
a
construction
to
the
elements.
and
having
given
that
construction,
it
came
to
the
conclusion
that
one
offense
was
a
true
lesser
included
offense
of
the
other,
and
therefore
under
double
jeopardy
principles,
and
we
agree,
successive
prosecutions
were
for
the
same
offense
and
therefore
barred.
but
let
me
say
in
this
case,
cce
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
intended
by
congress
to
be
the
same
offense
as
the
predicate.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
depends
on
the
statute
that
congress
passed.
congress
could
have
passed
a
cce-like
offense
that
was
nothing
more
than
an
aggravated
form
of
the
preceding
felony;
nothing
to
bar
congress
from
doing
that.
the
question
is
whether
this
statute
is
like
that;
or
whether,
as
we
contend,
it
is
not
simply
an
aggravated
form
of
the
predicate,
but
a
different
offense
and
different
in
a
meaningful
and
substantial
way
that
congress
intended
at
the
time.
from
its
text,
we
can
see
that
cce
is
based
on
the
new
concept
of
an
enterprise.
this
indicates
that
congress
envisions
cce
to
be
a
new
form
of
offense.
in
addition,
in
the
legislative
history
congress
made
it
clear
that
cce
was
not
meant
to
be
the
same
offense.
congress
distinguished
cce
from
provisions
that
merely
enhanced
the
penalty
for
or
aggravate
the
degree
of
a
basic
offense.
it
emphasized
repeatedly
that
cce
instead
is
a
new
and
distinct
offense.
finally,
the
policies
and
purposes
behind
cce
also
indicate
that
the
offenses
are
not
the
same.
cce
is
the
so-called
"kingpin
statute",
and
it
was
directed
at
large-scale
and
ongoing
drug
trafficking.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
jeffers
is
fundamentally
different.
let
me
briefly
state
why.
the
conspiracy
in
jeffers
was
not
one
of
the
predicates
for
the
prosecution.
rather,
the
court,
making
its
assumption
about
the
in-concert
element
being
conspiratorial
agreement,
essentially
concluded
that
the
conspiracy
in
jeffers
was
a
true
lesser
included
offense.
that
is,
whenever
the
government
establishes
cce,
it
will
always
and
necessarily
establish
that
kind
of
a
conspiracy.
given
that
view,
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
successive
prosecutions
constituted
double
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense,
and
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
authorize
cumulative
penalties
for
true
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses.
whatever
the
correctness
of
that
decision,
it
simply
does
not
apply
to
the
fundamentally
different
issue
in
this
case:
whether
cce
and
substantive
offenses
are
the
same
not
because
they
are
true
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses,
but
because
in
a
given
case
the
substantive
offense
is
used
as
a
predicate
for
the
compound
cce
offense.
we
think
that
is
a
fundamentally
different
issue,
and
that
in
light
of
the
language,
the
history,
and
importantly
the
purposes
of
the
kingpin
statute,
cce
and
the
substantive
of
predicates
are
not
the
same
offense.
