justice
white
what
did
he
plead
guilty
of
in
washington?
justice
white
do
you
say,
then,
that
the
next
day
in
washington
they
could
have
convicted
him
for
a
conspiring
to
import?
justice
white
separately?
justice
white
and
you
say
the
cce
charge
is
not
a
conspiracy
charge?
justice
white
but
it
takes
an
agreement,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
well,
he
has
to
have
concerted
activity
with
five--
justice
white
--five
or
more
persons.
now--
justice
white
--oh,
i
know.
i
know.
but
a
lot
of
times
you
just
prosecute
one
of
the
conspirators.
justice
white
but
what
does
"concerted
activity"
mean?
justice
white
well,
so
they
all
have
agreed
to
work
together.
justice
white
well,
even
if
you
can't
call
it
a
"conspiracy",
why
shouldn't
the
same
consequence
flow
from
this
strange
animal
as
flows
from
a
conspiracy?
justice
white
i
suppose
the
real
answer
is
that
in
this
case
you
can
prove
all
the
agreements
you
want,
but
you
can't
prove
the
cce
offense
without
proving
some
predicate
offenses.
justice
white
you
need
three,
or
however
many
you
need.
justice
white
and
you
don't
need
to
prove
those.
justice
white
you
don't
need
to
prove
any
act
except
an
agreement.
justice
white
i
think
the
answer
is
that
you
still
have
to
prove
the
predicate
offenses.
justice
white
if
all
the
jury
used
the
washington
evidence
for
was
to
prove
the
conspiracy
to
import
or
to
possess
or
whatever
it
is,
there
wouldn't
be
any
double
jeopardy
problem
there,
would
there?
justice
white
well,
might
not?
there
wouldn't
be.
you've
already
agreed
you
can
convict
separately
for
the
conspiracy.
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
i
thought
awhile
ago
you
said
that
you
could
convict
for
the
substantive
offense,
and
then
you
can
convict
separately
for
the
conspiracy
to--
justice
white
--albernaz.
justice
white
but
if
there
had
only
been
one
charge
in
this
case...
forget
the
cce
for
a
minute...
if
there
had
only
been
one
charge,
namely
the
conspiracy
charge,
they
could
have
used
the
washington
evidence
to
prove
the
conspiracy.
justice
white
mr.
levy,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
would
say
that
a
state
could
make
a
separate
crime
of
being
a
repeat
offender.
you
could
have
a
criminal
statute
that
said
any
time
anybody
has
committed
three
felonies
and
has
been
convicted
of
them,
you
may
then
indict
him
and
convict
him
of
having
committed
three
felonies.
is
that
right?
justice
white
why
isn't
it
like
that?
justice
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that.
but
why
wouldn't...
go
ahead
with
your
second
answer.
would
you
sustain
the
statute
in
my
example?
justice
white
well,
wouldn't
you
have
to
say
that
you
would
in
order
to
succeed
in
your
present
argument?
justice
white
just
making
a
separate
crime
out
of
having
committed
three
previous
felonies,
that
would
not
be
subject
to
attack
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
white
well,
the
usual
one
is
they
just
enhance
the
penalty
for
the
third--
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
you
could
always
say
that
when
the
first
felony
is
committed,
it's
not
a
lesser
included
offense
of
anything,
i
suppose,
and
it
certainly
isn't
a
lesser
included
offense
of
a
cce
when
the
first
one
happens.
neither
is
it
when
the
second
one
happens.
justice
white
well,
usually
a
lesser
included
offense
is
always...
as
soon
as
it
happens,
you
know
it's
a
lesser
included
offense
with
something
else.
