the
court
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
the
tony
and
susan
alamo
foundation
v.
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
gean,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
mr.
gean,
how
many
persons
are
affected
by
the
holding
in
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
burger
how
many
in
the
whole
pattern,
the
whole
program?
chief
justice
burger
i'm
not
speaking
of
members.
i'm
speaking
of
employees,
the
people
employed
who
are
directly
affected.
chief
justice
burger
well,
in
round
numbers,
how
many
people?
several
thousand?
chief
justice
burger
i
had
the
impression
there
were
a
great
many
more
people
directly
involved
than
300.
chief
justice
burger
well,
are
they
engaged
in
the
production
of
goods,
or
are
they
engaged
in
evangelistic
missionary
type
of
work?
chief
justice
burger
are
we
to
understand
that
these
300
people
you
described
earlier
are
the
people
who
run
all
these
business
enterprises?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
fried.
chief
justice
burger
mr.
fried,
the
ymca
runs
boys'
camps
all
over
the
united
states.
the
key
people
who
are
the
permanent
professional
staff,
of
course,
are
paid
salaries.
and
my
question
doesn't
address
that.
they
have
volunteers
who
are
sometimes
school
teachers,
sometimes
lawyers
or
whatever,
who
will
take
two
weeks
or
a
month
and
act
as
group
leaders.
it's
not
without
it
isn't
a
religious
activity,
but
it's
not
without
its
religious
connotations.
how
would
you
classify
this
group
leader
who
is
a
volunteer
who
comes
in
for
two
or
four
weeks
in
charge
of
eight,
ten,
or
twelve
boys?
chief
justice
burger
he
doesn't
get
paid,
by
the
way.
i
should
have
he
doesn't
get
paid,
but
he
gets
his
room
and
his
board.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
gean?
you
have
only
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
gean.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
