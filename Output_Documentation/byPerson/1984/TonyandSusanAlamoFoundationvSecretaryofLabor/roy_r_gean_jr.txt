mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
alamo
foundation
was
an
outgrowth
of
the
activities
of
tony
and
susan
alamo
in
the
los
angeles
area
of
california.
these
two
persons
were
street
workers.
they
went
about
the
streets
of
los
angeles
and
the
surrounding
suburbs
during
the
'60s
for
the
purpose
of
reaching
those
people
who
had
become
derelicts
or
were
down-and-outers,
with
the
gospel
of
christ.
it
was
their
intention
to
be
evangelists,
and
in
fact
they
were,
and
later
they
became
pastors.
as
evangelists,
they
met
many
young
people
who
were
at
that
stage
in
our
nation's
history
when
the
hippies
were
quite
active,
and
they
had
some
very
definite
ideas
about
dress,
codes
of
conduct,
and
general
activities.
they
had
definite
ideas
about
the
attention
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
concern
for
others,
which
was
contrary
to
the
best
interest
of
society
and
their
neighbors.
tony
and
susan
alamo
in
their
evangelistic
activities
reached
many
of
these
young
people.
on
one
occasion
which
led
to
the
organization
of
the
foundation
and
these
people,
many
testified
three
of
the
people
testified
in
regard
to
these
matters.
as
representatives
of
the
entire
group,
these
young
people
were
contacted
by
the
foundation
and
experienced
the
salvation
that
came
from
the
gospel
of
christ.
on
one
occasion,
a
young
man
who
had
been
a
dope
peddler
had
been
converted,
and
he
was
living
with
a
group
of
young
people,
20
or
30
of
them,
that
were
involved
in
the
same
activities.
he
asked
tony
and
susan
alamo
if
they
would
come
home
with
him,
a
place
that
he
had
rented,
and
from
which
he
was
selling
dope
in
the
los
angeles
area
to
the
young
people
and
the
other
persons
of
that
community
who
would
buy
from
this
sort
of
a
peddler.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
directly,
your
honor,
with
the
foundation,
there
are
approximately
300
persons
who
are
called
associates.
i
would
term
them,
and
they
have
been
termed
throughout
many
pages
of
the
transcript
and
in
the
briefs,
as
pastors
and
evangelists.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
this
is
a
pentacostal
group
and
it
is
quite
common
among
pentacostal
groups
to
not
keep
records
of
membership.
they
have
many
churches.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
those
would
be,
your
honor,
the
some
300
that
are
pastors
and
evangelists,
and
that
is
all
that
would
be
affected
directly.
of
course,
indirectly
in
other
churches,
or
other
religious
activities
throughout
the
united
states,
your
decision
here
will
have
a
far-reaching
effect
upon
the
activities
of
those
people
who
are
associated
with
like
or
similar
foundations
or
like
or
similar
religious
churches.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
i
would
say
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people,
your
honor.
i
would
say
those
people
that
are
associated
with
the
church
to
which
i
belong,
which
has
some
12
to
15
million
in
the
united
states.
many
of
them
are
similar
to
my
situation.
i
think
my
church
will
be
affected
by
your
decision
in
this
particular
matter
and
the
type
of
activities
to
which
i
am
allowed
to
participate
on
a
volunteer
basis
without
the
necessity
of
being
required
to
take
a
wage
or
to
have
some
benefit
given
to
me
because
of
my
activities.
so
i
hope
i
am
answering
your
question,
your
honor,
by--
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
--well,
also
it
swings,
your
honor,
around
the
300
associates
who
are
pastors
and
evangelists.
those
people
who
are
in
training
or
those
people
who
are
actually
involved
as
pastors
and
evangelists
in
churches
that
are
affiliated
with
a
foundation
across
the
united
states,
from
new
york
to
washington,
to
miami,
to
omaha,
to
dallas,
to
nashville,
to
los
angeles,
for
the
churches
of
this
particular
religious
organization.
and
they
are
manned
and
staffed
by
these
pastors
and
evangelists
who
are
involved
in
training
and
teaching
primarily
in
alma,
arkansas
where
there
are
some
37
different
activities
that
the
secretary
of
labor
claims
are
activities
of
such
a
nature
that
it
is
demanding
upon
this
court
that
they
decide
that
they
are
so
commercial
in
nature,
these
activities
that
are
performed
by
the
pastors
and
evangelists,
that
they
are
so
commercial
in
nature
that
they
must
come
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
i
hope
i've
answered
your
question,
your
honor.
there
are
many
people
that
will
be
affected
by
this
decision
indirectly.
those
that
are
directly
affected
are
some
approximate
300
associates,
which
are
termed
pastors
and
evangelists.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
their
activities
are
religious.
the
district
court
found
that
all
of
their
activities
were
religious,
that
these
activities
were
religious
and
they
were
carried
on
for
religious
purposes.
that's
what
the
district
court
found.
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit
also
found
the
same
thing.
now,
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
in
their
opinion.
there
are
discrepancies
in
the
opinion
of
both
the
courts
because
of
the
fact
that
they
allege
that
the
activities
of
these
people,
these
some
300
associates,
pastors
and
evangelists,
are
solely
all
of
their
activities
are
solely
for
religious
purposes.
and
then
they
decide
that
the
activities
are
of
such
a
nature
that
they
are
commercial
and
therefore
they
should
come
within
the
confines
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
i
think
that's
a
well-established
law,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
does,
and
i
think
rightfully
so.
the
difference
in
this
particular
case
is
that
these
people
have
found
that
it
is--
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
--well,
it
certainly
has
been
applied
to
many
people
who
are
involved
in
church-related
activities,
such
as
schools,
nurseries,
where
they
are
paid
a
wage.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
i
cannot
tell
you
offhand
that
there
is
such
an
application
of
the
act
to
ministers.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
if
it
was
a
salary,
i
wouldn't
think
so,
if
it
is
in
truth
and
in
fact
a
salary.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
one
of
the
aspects.
and
certainly
it
should
be
of
great
importance
to
the
court,
and
i
see
it
is
because
of
your
questions,
and
i
think
it's
an
excellent
question.
in
my
opinion,
in
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
the
37
agencies
or
activities
or,
as
the
secretary
of
labor
says,
commercial
activities,
commercial
business
activities,
that
these
are
not
received
solely
for
the
purpose
of
their
entire
support.
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
the
secretary
of
labor
misses
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
--if
it's
received
with
the
expectation
that
that
is
compensation,
i
think
it
probably
would
apply.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
unless
it
is
clear
that
this
is
part
of
their
religious
practices.
and
i
think
this
court
should
go
a
long
ways
in
protecting
religious
practices,
unless
there
is
some
reason...
now,
the
beliefs...
this
court
religious
beliefs
protects...
practices...
there
are
some
limitations
in
regard
to
the
application
of
the
constitutional
restriction,
and
there's
a
constitutional
restriction
in
regard
to
practices,
practices
that
are
involving
health
or
safety
certainly
have
been
regulated,
and
the
regulation
has
been
approved
by
this
court.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
not
for
certain
about
that
particular
case,
and
i
don't
recall
all
of
the
facts
that's
in
that
particular
case.
i
can
say
that
in
reference
to,
i
believe,
what
you're
pointing
out
there,
in
this
particular
case
the
alamo
foundation
does
not
have
to
pay
social
security
taxes.
that's
part
of
the
internal
revenue
exemption.
and
their
determination
in
their
exemption,
which
is
a
part
of
the
appendix,
sets
forth
that
they
do
not
have
to
pay
social
security
taxes,
and
it's
so
set
forth
in
their
determination
that
they
are
a
religious
organization,
organized
under
501(c)(3)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
they
are
exempted
from
the
collection
and
the
payment
of
social
security
taxes
by
virtue
of
that
determination.
it
so
sets
forth
in
their
determination.
now--
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
we
call
them
activities.
and
i
think--
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
--cafes
or
restaurants.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
there
was
some
competition,
but
primarily
those
organizations,
those
entities
which
i
call
activities
and
which
you
might
refer
to,
commonly
known
as
business
or
commercial
activities,
they
are
conducted
primarily
to
provide
for
the
clothing,
the
housing,
the
food,
the
transportation
and
communication
of
the
members.
that's
the
basic
purpose
of
it.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
not
any
of
the
others;
no,
sir.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
uh
the--
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
the
record
keeping
business.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
primarily
and
i
think
that
tony
alamo
did
testify
that
there
was
some
assistance
in
record
keeping
of
other
people.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
so
i
would
say
i'll
have
to
change
that
statement,
your
honor;
that
there
was
some
activity
on
the
part
of
that
particular
southwest
business
management
which
was
for
record
keeping,
but
ordinarily
it
was
for
the
church
members
or
for
these
associates.
now,
bear
in
mind
there
are
other
church
members,
other
than
the
300
associates,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
at
first,
your
honor,
there
was
some
eight
employees
that
are
called
outside
employees
by
the
district
court.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
were
covered
by
the
act.
and
they
were
involved
at
the
beginning
of
their
activities
of
this
nature,
but
after
a
short
period
of
time
they
were
no
longer
involved.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
other
than
at
the
very
beginning
of
their
utilizing
these
activities,
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
providing
shelter,
food,
transportation,
clothing,
for
the
associates.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
is
not
anyone
at
the
present
time,
and
has
not
been,
and
was
not
when
the
district
court
sat
and
had
its
first
hearing
in
april
of
1982.
there
was
not
any
at
that
particular
time,
persons
who
are
referred
to
as
outside
employees.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
the
motel,
your
honor,
is
one
in
tippi,
arizona.
and
that
is
the
only
motel
operation
that
was
under
the
auspices
of
the
alamo
foundation.
it
was
open
to
the
public.
but,
your
honor,
the
primary
emphasis
and
the
thrust
of
their
activities,
all
of
these
activities,
was
evangelistic.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
that
particular
organization,
the
alamo
quarries,
the
alamo
ready-mix
which
i
believe
you
have
reference
to,
and
those
other
similar
type
building
activities,
or
as
might
be
referred
to
as
business
practices,
were
conducted
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
housing,
the
schools,
the
training
places,
the
churches
of
the
foundation.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
i
cannot
tell
you
that,
your
honor,
that
they
did
not
take
some.
but
i--
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
--your
honor,
if
a
church
member
wanted
some
activity
on
the
part
of
the
alamo
concrete,
i
believe
that
they
did
some.
and
the
same
thing
with
the
roofing
company.
but
other
than
that,
it
was
very,
very
limited.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
by
the
time
the
district
court
met
and
had
its
first
hearing
in
april
of
1982,
there
were
not
any
what
is
termed
as
"outside
personnel"
involved
in
the
activities.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
they
are
in
i
believe
there
is
four
states.
there
is
california,
arizona,
arkansas,
and
tennessee.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
sir?
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes.
do
not
get
the
idea,
your
honor,
that
these
were
huge
undertakings.
perhaps
mr.
alamo
was
mistaken
in
proceeding
to
itemize
his
activities.
but
for
bookkeeping
and
record
activities,
he
did
this.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
that
was
one
that
was
done
for
other
persons.
i
can
say
that
the
alamo
foundation
and
i
believe
it
came
out
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
alamo
that
they
were
contacted
by
a
commercial
group
to
do
some
sort
of
sewing
for
them,
and
that
was
done.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
those
were
the
eight
employees
that
were
involved
at
the
beginning
of
the
foundation's
activities
that
were
ceased
prior
to
the
time
that
the
district
court
heard
this
matter,
and
it
was
agreed
that
those
parties
were
employees.
and
for
example,
the
record
in
bookkeeping
activity,
mr.
alamo
provided
that
there
was
some
overtime
wage
that
had
to
be
paid
to
those
people,
and
it
amounts
to
approximately
$14,000.
for
example,
one
of
the
gentlemen
was
earning
$600
a
week
and
he
worked
sometimes
more
than
40
hours.
and
the
secretary
of
labor
came
and
said
look,
you're
receiving
$600
a
week,
and
at
40
hours
you're
getting
$15
an
hour,
but
when
you
work
for
42
hours
for
that
particular
week,
why
you're
entitled
to
the
overtime
pay.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
not
at
this
time,
your
honor.
the
district
court
did
find
that
those
particular
employees,
those
outside
personnel
that
were
involved
in
these
activities,
were
entitled
to
some
overtime
pay,
and
i've
rounded
off
it
comes
to
approximately
$14,000.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
no.
no,
they
were
not
associates
of
the
foundation
in
the
term
that
i
have
been
using.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
the
associate,
your
honor,
is
a
synonym
for
those
persons
associated
with
the
foundation
as
pastors
and
evangelists.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
it
is
their
statement.
and
the
district
court
so
found
that
their
activities
were
solely
of
a
religious
nature.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
to
explain
that.
they
have
300
people
that
are
associates.
there
are
some
wives
or
husbands,
as
the
case
may
be.
these
people
are
basically
pentecostal.
that
is
their
doctrine
pentecostal.
have
the
charismatic
approach
to
the
gospel,
they
believe
in
the
teachings
of
jesus,
and
the
commands
and
directions
that
were
given
to
the
apostles
are
for
this
particular
day.
the
healing
and
sign
gifts,
they
claim,
is
part
of
their
religious
activity.
and
they
believe
that
that's
the
instruction.
and
there
are
thousands,
millions
of
people
across
the
united
states
in
the
pentecostal
movements
that
have
exactly
the
same
doctrinal
teachings
and
understandings
of
the
gospel.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
they
wouldn't
what?
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
they
were
paid
a
wage.
these
people
were
paid
a
wage,
and
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
well,
that
would
have
to
be
seen.
i
do
not
know
of
any
instance,
your
honor,
where
these
people
that
were
receiving
a
wage
ever
became
an
associate.
certainly
it's
not
in
the
record
and
i
want
to
be
fair
with
you,
your
honor;
i
don't
recall
any
and
don't
know
of
any,
and
we've
been
representing
the
foundation
now
for
approximately
five
years.
i
don't
know
of
any
former
paid
employee
that
is
now
an
associate.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
attitude,
the
desire,
and
the
belief
of
the
individual
has
a
great
deal
of
control
over
it.
i
think
that
that's
the
main
thrust.
and
if
these
people
are
not
paid
a
wage
or
derive
some
compensation
in
the
form
of
a
salary,
then
i
do
not
believe
that
they're
covered
by
the
act.
if
what
they
say
and,
your
honor,
there
were
three
people
that
testified
as
representative
of
all
of
these
this
was
agreed
upon,
to
be
done
in
this
fashion
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
concise
record
and
a
brief
record
for
the
court
or
any
appellate
court
to
which
this
case
might
be
taken.
these
three
people
testified
as
representatives.
at
the
pretrial
conference
before
the
hearing
that
was
held
in
april
of
1982,
it
was
agreed
by
the
attorney,
the
general
counsel
from
or
the
trial
counsel
from
dallas,
texas
that
this
would
be
agreeable
with
him
that
these
three
people
who
testified
and
there
were
bill
levy,
ann
elmore,
and
edward
mick
that
these
three
people
would
be
representatives
of
all
of
those
that
would
testify.
there
were
155
affidavits
given
by
more
than
half
of
those
people
that
were
associates
of
the
foundation
to
the
secretary
of
labor's
attorney.
and
the
court
said
now,
if
you
find
in
these
affidavits
or
in
your
own
investigation
that
these
people
are
not
representative,
and
you
want
others
to
testify,
you
certainly
have
that
right
to
do
so.
there
was
not
any
of
the
others
called.
these
three
people
that
testified,
your
honor,
in
regard
to
this
very
thing
about
which
you're
questioning
me
said
that
it
would
be
repugnant
to
them
to
claim
that
what
they
were
doing
was
for
a
wage.
yes,
some
of
them
worked
at
various
times
within
these
various
activities,
or
as
the
secretary
of
labor
calls
common
business
activities.
but
also
these
three
people,
every
one
of
them,
testified
that
they
worked
outside
the
foundation.
every
one
of
them
testified
to
that,
or
that
they
had
income
upon
which
they
could
live.
every
one
of
them.
ann
elmore
testified
that
she
had
outside
income
coming
to
her.
she
testified,
when
she
was
asked
by
the
secretary
of
labor,
well,
suppose
that
you
needed
some
assistance;
what
would
you
do
for
the
benefits
that
you
need
to
live?
and
she
said,
well,
we'd
go
out
and
get
them.
now,
the
secretary
of
labor
interpreted
that
as
meaning
that
they
would
go
out
into
the
foundation
and
in
the
foundation's
activities
and
work
and
get
these
benefits.
she
didn't
mean
that
at
all.
if
you
would
read
all
of
her
testimony,
what
she
was
saying
was,
if
they
did
not
have
the
benefit,
they
would
go
outside
the
foundation
and
work,
which
many
of
them
did.
some
completely
all
of
their
time
was
devoted
outside
the
foundation,
even
though
they
were
associates.
they
worked
in
none
of
these
related
as
the
internal
revenue
declared,
these
are
related
activities
under
the
internal
revenue
agency
of
the
united
states.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
no,
sir;
it
does
not.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
no,
sir;
it
does
not.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
well,
in
alma,
arkansas,
your
honor
we
have
buses.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
no,
sir.
no,
they
did
have
cash.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
it
comes
from
the
foundation
and
from
the
other
members
of
the
foundation
who
work,
or
the
church
members
who
contribute
to
the
pastors
and
evangelists
who
go
out
for
the
purpose
of
spreading
the
gospel.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
it
was
not
pay.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
paying
for
their
expenses
and
conducting
the
religious
activities
of
the
foundation.
your
honor,
these
people
are
extremely
dedicated
to
the
purpose
with
which
they
have
aligned
themselves
and
congregated
themselves
together.
it's
unbelievable,
the
dedication
that
these
people
have.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
no,
sir;
it
does
not.
but
it's
very
small.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
your
honor,
if
this
court
decides
that
these
people,
these
associates,
must
be
paid
the
sum
of
$19
million
which
the
secretary
of
labor
says
is
due--
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
--no,
sir;
the
decree
does
not
require
that.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
the
secretary
of
labor--
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
--i
believe
that's
true.
now,
why
require
it?
why
have
an
exercise
in
futility?
why
make
these
people
take
the
money
and
then
give
it
back
to
the
foundation,
when
at
the
very
beginning
and
we
have
three
cases
that
we
have
been
arguing
to
the
district
court
and
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
addresses
this
very
question,
and
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
never
commented
on
those
three
cases.
that's
the
turner
v.
unification,
rogers
v.
schenkel,
and
this
court's
decision
in
rawlings
v.
portland
terminal,
where
these
people
worked
in
business
activities,
agreed-upon
were
common
business
activities
and
were
common
businesses,
and
these
people
did
not
want
a
wage,
they
did
not
expect
a
wage,
they
so
stated,
and
this
court
in
rawlings
v.
portland
terminal,
said
that
they
didn't
have
to
receive
it
and
they
were
not
covered
by
the
act.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
first
circuit
in
regard
to
the
turner
v.
unification
church,
which
is
almost
identical
to
this
particular
case.
very
little
difference.
now,
the
secretary
of
labor
is
trying
to
point
out
that
difference,
but
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
on
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
in
my
concluding
remarks
in
this
last
minute,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
far-reaching
matter
that
has
been
presented
to
this
particular
court.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
state
does
have
a
compelling
interest
to
govern
these
activities
and
to
say
these
activities
on
the
part
of
these
pastors
and
evangelists
are
such
that
they
should
be
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
it
is
our
position
that
if
these
activities
are
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
position
that
everybody
knows,
that
these
people
are
going
to
take
the
money
that
they
receive
from
the
foundation
and
give
it
back
to
the
foundation,
what
is
the
state's
compelling
interest
to
govern
and
to
rule
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
as
to
the
activities,
the
benefits,
the
wages,
the
salaries
that
they
may
receive?
in
walling--
mr.
roy
r.
gean,
jr.
--thank
you,
your
honor.
