mr.
gean,
before
you
go
on,
the
associates
operated
several
businesses.
that's
agreed,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
well,
they
were
gasoline
stations,
clothing
stores,
grocery
stores.
they
were
activities
but--
justice
jr.
--restaurant.
justice
jr.
did
they
compete
with
other
businesses
engaged
in
the
same
activity?
justice
jr.
if
a
member
of
the
public
generally
walked
into
the
restaurant,
would
he
or
she
be
served?
justice
jr.
or
in
any
of
the
other
stores
or
business
i
suppose?
justice
jr.
which
would
not
serve
the
public?
justice
jr.
well,
you
said
some
are
never
in
the
business
of
serving
the
public.
i
don't
want
to
detain
you.
justice
jr.
the
record
keeping
business?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
yes.
so
were
these
businesses
operated
entirely
by
associates
or
were
there
other
people
who
were
not
characterized--
justice
jr.
--are
they
covered
by
the
act?
justice
jr.
not
a
single
outside
non-associate
person?
justice
jr.
mr.
gean,
everyone
has
to
have
some
cash.
where
did
the
associates
get
the
cash
that
everyone
must
have
for
just
incidentals
riding
the
subway
or--
justice
jr.
--you're
not
suggesting
that
the
associates
never
had
any
cash?
justice
jr.
where
did
it
come
from?
justice
jr.
so
the
church
did
pay
some
cash
to
associates.
justice
jr.
well,
it
was
given.
justice
jr.
does
the
record
show
the
amount
of
cash
paid
to
associates?
