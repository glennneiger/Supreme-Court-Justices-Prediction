mr.
gean,
does
the
record
show
with
respect
to
these
300
people
a
typical
number
of
hours
per
week--
justice
rehnquist
--that
any
of
them
put
in
on
the
foundation
activities?
justice
rehnquist
does
that
extend
not
only
to
registered
nurse,
but
licensed
practical
nurses
and
some
of
the
subcategories?
justice
rehnquist
orderlies?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fried,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
gean
that
the
record
simply
doesn't
speak
as
to
what
the
typical
number
of
hours
per
week
put
in
in
foundation
activities
was
by
these
300
people?
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
to
the
legal
outcome
of
this
case
whether
the
typical
member
of
the
300
put
in
four
or
five
hours
a
week
and
had
a
full-time
outside
job
as
opposed
to
being
employed
only
by
the
foundation?
