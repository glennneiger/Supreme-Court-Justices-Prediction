justice
o'connor
mr.
gean,
does
the
act
apply
to
other
employees
of
churches
who
are
paid
salaries?
secretaries
or
clerical
employees?
justice
o'connor
has
the
act
been
applied
to
the
salaries
of
ministers,
do
you
know?
justice
o'connor
how
about
a
minister
who's
paid
a
wage
to
serve
his
particular--
justice
o'connor
--if
there
were,
is
it
invalid
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
how
about
the
income
tax?
would
it
be
invalid
to
apply
a
federal
income
tax
to
salaries
paid
ministers
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
well,
does
this
case
come
down
then
to
a
question
of
whether
the
board
and
room
and
other
benefits
is
the
equivalent
of
a
salary?
is
that
what
we
really
have
to
decide
here?
justice
o'connor
i
don't
think
i
understand
your
point.
do
you
believe
that
if
board
and
lodging
is
received
by
someone
with
the
expectation
and
understanding
that
it's
compensation,
that
the
federal
fair
labor
standards
act
may
properly
apply
to
them?
justice
o'connor
even
though
they
were
working
for
a
church?
justice
o'connor
is
that
because
of
the
free
exercise
clause
that
you
make
this
argument?
justice
o'connor
and
then
how
do
you
distinguish
united
states
v.
lee,
where
this
court
held
that
the
amish
employers
were
not
entitled
to
the
exemption
for
the
social
security
act
payments,
even
though
it
was
a
direct
conflict
with
their
religious
practices
and
beliefs
to
pay
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
associates
are,
as
alleged,
professionals,
why
are
they
not
within
the
scope
of
the
exemption?
that's
the
allegation.
justice
o'connor
mr.
fried,
i
didn't
understand
your
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question
about
the
nuns.
are
they
or
are
they
not
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
rendering
services
in
hospitals?
justice
o'connor
how
about
employees
of
salvation
army
thrift
stores
that
are
undergoing
rehabilitation
and
who
receive
room
and
board?
justice
o'connor
well,
in
this
case,
in
your
view,
does
it
turn
on
whether
the
associates
had
the
expectation
of
compensation
in
the
form
of
room
and
board?
is
that
the
crux
of
the
case
for
our
purposes?
justice
o'connor
what
testimony
supports
that
in
your
view?
the
word
"substantial"
troubles
me
because
i
didn't
see
much
that
i
thought
was
supportive
of
that
finding.
justice
o'connor
so
in
your
view,
then,
the
monks
making
wine
or
jams
and
jellies
would
be
equally
subject
to
federal
fair
labor
standards
act.
justice
o'connor
what
makes
one
a
professional?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
fried,
how
about
youngsters,
young
people
who
go
to
summer
camps
for
the
handicapped
in
the
summer,
and
they
expect
to
get
room
and
board
for
volunteering
their
services
at
the
camps
to
help
handicapped
children?
i
guess
they're
subject
to
the
act
under
your
view?
justice
o'connor
--and
what
section
do
we
look
to
for
that?
justice
o'connor
and
that's
in
the
appendix
someplace,
is
it,
or
not?
don't
take
time
from
your
argument.
