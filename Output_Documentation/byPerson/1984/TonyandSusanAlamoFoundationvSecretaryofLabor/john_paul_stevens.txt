--mr.
gean,
to
what
extent
were
these
people
paid
cash
compensation?
did
they
get
some
cash
compensation?
justice
stevens
well,
what
about
i'm
just
looking
at
the
district
court's
finding
gerald
rich,
the
payroll
ledger
indicates
that
mr.
rich
was
paid
$8
an
hour
for
all
hours
worked
and
so
forth.
i
just
noticed
a
few
of
these.
justice
stevens
those
people
aren't
involved
in
this
case?
is
that
it?
justice
stevens
just
so
i
understand,
the
district
court
described
16,
i
think,
different
people
at
31
to
34
of
the
appendix
for
these
services.
were
they
other
than
the
cash
payments
or
18,
rather
not
16
would
they
have
been
associates
had
they
not
gotten
some
cash?
justice
stevens
i
see.
how
do
you
define
an
associate?
just--
justice
stevens
--but
what
portion
of
their
work
was
devoted
to
economic
ventures
and
what
portion
to
religious
activities?
justice
stevens
even
running
the
restaurant
is
solely
of
a
religious
nature?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
remedy?
what
will
happen
if
you
lose?
do
these
people
have
to
take
the
money?
justice
stevens
i
didn't
read
the
decree
to
require
that.
does
it
require
payment?
justice
stevens
it
requires
they
give
notice
to
them
of
the
amount
that
they
would
have
a
right
to
claim.
justice
stevens
if
your
description
of
them
is
correct,
i
would
assume
none
of
them
would
really
claim
the
money.
justice
stevens
mr.
fried,
can
i
ask
you...
do
you
think
the
portland
terminal
case
would
have
been
decided
differently
if
the
trainees
were
given
room
and
board
during
the
week
of
training?
justice
stevens
but
the
benefit,
if
you
accept
your
opponent's
view
of
the
case,
the
benefit
was
entirely
a
benefit
to
this
religious
mission
that
they
carried
out;
was
it
not?
i
mean
in
the
long
run,
because
he
testified...
and
i
understand
you
did
not
contradict
his
testimony...
that
the
net
result
of
all
this
was
not
any
profit,
but
whatever
they
earned
they
poured
into
their
religious
mission.
justice
stevens
well,
didn't
he
testify
the
whole
enterprise
was
not
profitable?
justice
stevens
and
you
didn't
contradict
that
with
any
evidence,
even
though
his
records
are
available
to
you.
justice
stevens
as
i
understand
the
record.
so
it
would
only
have
to
accept
that
testimony.
