mr.
charles
fried
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
first
if
i
may,
just
to
clear
up
a
number
of
questions
that
were
raised,
the
congress
quite
specifically
stated
and
i
referred
in
note
10
of
our
brief
that
wages
includes
the
cost
of
board,
food,
lodging,
and
similar
benefits.
moreover,
a
number
of
the
associates
testified
that
they
received
allowances,
cash
allowances
of
$5
and
$10
a
week,
and
one
of
the
former
associates
testified
that
there
would
be
penalties
assessed
against
those
payments
for
failure
to
report
to
work
and
other
alleged
violations
of
the
regulations
of
the
organization.
in
respect
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
ministers
are
professionals
and
therefore
not
within
the
scope
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
as
to
the
testimony,
there
was--
mr.
charles
fried
--they
may
be
professional
ministers.
the
question
would
be
in
their
activities
in
the
gas
stations,
in
the
restaurants
and
so
on,
are
they
working
as
professional
ministers?
and
it
is
our
contention,
of
course,
that
they
are
not.
as
to
the
testimony,
i
must
point
out
that
in
addition
to
the
three
representative
present
associates,
there
was
testimony
from
a
number
of
former
associates,
which
is
also
in
the
record
and
which
we
have
summarized,
which
of
course
is
in
many
respects
contradictory
to
the
testimony
of
the
present
associates.
in
1961,
the
congress
amended
the
fair
labor
standards
act
for
the
stated
purpose
of
extending
wages
and
hours
protection
to
persons
working
in
the
ordinary
commercial
enterprises
of
churches
and
other
charities.
now,
this
was
accomplished
by
applying
the
act
to
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce,
and
then
defining
an
enterprise
as
"related
activities
performed
for
a
common
business
purpose.
"
the
court
below
found
as
a
fact
that
the
petitioner
operated
a
number
of
ordinary
businesses
serving
the
public
in
competition
with
other
businesses.
and
it
should
be
quite
clear
and
i
refer
now
to
pages
9
and
10
and
38
and
39
of
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner
for
certiorari
that
the
district
court
limited
the
application
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
only
to
those
associates
who
were
working
in
these
commercial
businesses
and
only
insofar
as
they
were
working
in
those
commercial
businesses.
now,
it's
important
that
we
distinguish--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
do
not.
i
do
not.
i'm
unable
to
enlighten
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
that's
a
complicated
matter
which
i
would
be
glad
to--
mr.
charles
fried
--who
make
jams
and
jellies.
mr.
charles
fried
the
internal
revenue
service
has
taken
the
position
that
those
activities
constitute
unrelated
business
activities.
they
are
in
fact
in
the
tax
court
at
this
very
moment
in--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
monks,
monks
who
are
engaged
in
extensive
farming
enterprises.
and
in
the
tax
court,
the
internal
revenue
service
is
taking
the
position
that
those
services
are
not
contributed
services
because
the
monks
receive
room
and
board.
i
think
that's
an
important
point
to
know,
since
the--
mr.
charles
fried
--in
1968,
the
act
was
extended
further
to
cover
specifically
schools
and
hospitals.
and
congress
did
in
the
debate
indicate
an
assumption
that
nuns
would
not
be
covered
when
they
worked
in
the
ministry
of
healing
the
sick,
but
that
must
be
on
the
assumption
that
they
were
in
fact
operating
as
nurses,
and
nurses
are,
of
course,
professionals.
mr.
charles
fried
do
you
mean
income
tax
of
the
business,
your
honor,
or
income
tax
of
the
associates?
mr.
charles
fried
the
petitioners
state,
and
for
the
first
time
in
their
reply
brief
cite
section
512,
stating
that
this
was
determined
to
be
unrelated
business
income.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
conclusion,
and
indeed
the
letter
which
petitioners
cite
in
their
appendix
says
specifically
and
i
refer
to
page
14
of
that
appendix:
"in
this
letter
we
are
not
determining
whether
any
of
your
present
or
proposed
activities
are
unrelated
trade
or
business
as
defined
in
section
513.
"
now,
we
were
quite
disturbed
to
find
this
reference
to
the
act
in
the
reply
brief
for
the
first
time,
and
were
told
by
the
internal
revenue
service
first
that
they
are
unable
to
give
us
any
information
regarding
the
specific
tax
status
of
the
petitioners,
unless
the
petitioners
were
willing
to
waive
their
protections
under
the
privacy
act;
and
second,
that
the
service
has
regularly
taken
the
position
on
facts
similar
to
these
and
i
have
the
citation
for
your
honor
if
you
wish
them
that
such
facts
would
constitute
the
businesses
unrelated
business
income
and
the
services
would
not
be
considered
contributed
services,
since
they
were
rendered
in
return
for
board
and
lodging.
mr.
charles
fried
as
professionals,
they
surely
are
not.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
your
honor.
they
are
subject,
however,
to
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
charles
fried
because
nurses
are
professionals,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
have
to
conjecture.
i
could
not
give
you
a
firm
assurance
on
that.
mr.
charles
fried
orderlies
surely
are
not
professionals.
that's
pushing
the
point
further
than
i
would
wish
to
push
it.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
the
question
of
rehabilitative
services
is
a
difficult
one,
and
the
portland
terminal
case
is
very
important
in
this
regard
because
if
the
employees
are
working
for
their
own
benefits
and
the
portland
terminal
care
spoke,
if
i
may
quote
from
that
case,
accepting
the
unchallenged
findings
here
that
the
railroads
which
was
the
putative
employer
received
no
"immediate
advantage
from
any
work
done
by
the
trainees,
we
hold
that
they
are
not
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
"
now,
in
the
thrift
store
example,
there
is
of
course
the
receipt
of
an
immediate
advantage,
and
so
the
question
of
coverage
would
be
posed
in
a
way
it
surely
was
not
posed
in
the
portland
terminal
case
and
is
not
posed
by
candy
stripers
working
in
a
hospital
gift
shop
or
museum
gift
shop.
mr.
charles
fried
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
and
there
was
substantial
testimony
to
the
effect
that
they
and
i
am
now
quoting
from
the
district
court
"contemplated
that
they
would
be
fed,
clothed,
sheltered,
as
a
result.
"
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
those
words.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
there
is
considerable
testimony
from
the
former
associates
and
of
particular
importance
is
ann
elmore
who's
a
present
associate,
chosen
by
petitioners
as
a
representative
associate,
who
said,
and
i
quote:
"if
you
want
to
eat,
you've
got
to
work.
"
that's
on
page
76
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
on
page
78
of
the
joint
appendix
ann
elmore,
who
is
a
chosen
representative
by
the
petitioners,
says:
"and,
of
course,
you
do
expect
the
benefits?
"
question.
answer:
"well,
the
benefits
are
just
a
matter
of
of
course,
we
went
out
and
we
worked
for
them.
"
now,
the
former
associates
are
a
good
bit
clearer
on
this
point.
for
instance,
i
believe
that
it
is
judy
shapiro
who
says
on
page
218
that
when
she
was
ill
or
when
she
was
prevented
from
working
because
of
inclement
weather,
and
she
sent
to
the
restaurant
for
food,
she
was
admonished
that
that
food
she
should
have
procured
out
of
her
own
funds
because
while
she
was
not
working,
she
was
not
entitled
to
get
these
in
kind
benefits.
so
there
was
ample
testimony
in
the
record
to
substantiate
the
court's
finding
that
they
contemplated
that
they
would
be
fed,
clothed,
and
sheltered
as
a
result
of
their
work
at
the
foundation's
commercial
businesses,
quid
pro
quo.
mr.
charles
fried
to
the
extent
to
the
extent
that
they
are
not
professionals,
administrators,
or
managers,
they
would
indeed.
that
is
correct.
and
of
course--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
exercise
of
a
recognized
profession.
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
not,
myself,
extend
it
to
that
extent,
but
i'm
not--
mr.
charles
fried
--operating
a
retail
store
would
surely
not
be
a
case
of
being
a
professional,
but
it
might
render
a
person
a
manager.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
if
they
were
sales
persons,
then
they
would
clearly
be
covered.
if
they
were
managers
of
the
store,
the
managers,
bona
fide
managers,
are
excluded
by
the
terms
of
the
statute.
we
also
have
waitresses,
persons
who
work
pumping
gas,
people
working
on
labor
crews
for
construction
companies,
women
sewing
clothing
in
clothing
factories
who
could
not
be
viewed
as
managers
or
professionals
in
any
sense.
now,
petitioners
do
urge
that
the
associates
and
we
do
not
question
work
out
of
a
sense
of
devotion,
and
that
they
would
have
volunteered
their
efforts
even
if
they
hadn't
received
these
benefits.
and
again,
we
don't
question
that
because
that's
not
truly
relevant.
i
suppose
there
are
many
people,
many
people
in
this
courtroom
today,
who
do
work
which
they
consider
valuable
enough
and
interesting
enough
that
they
would,
if
they
could
afford
it,
carry
it
on
even
if
not
compensated.
but
that
hardly
constitutes
any
of
us
not
employees
for
that
reason.
mr.
charles
fried
there
are
specific
exemptions
for
summer
recreational
works.
mr.
charles
fried
in
the
act.
and
specific
exemptions
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
to
make
regulations
for
young
people's
work
as
well.
so
those
particular
cases
would
be
taken
care
of
under
the
act.
mr.
charles
fried
that
i
believe
is
section
213.
i
believe
it's
section
213,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
that's
a
very
difficult--
mr.
charles
fried
--it's
a
difficult
question,
and
what
distinguishes
it
and
distinguishes
it
most
importantly
from
the
case
we
have
here
is
that
group
leader,
first,
does
not
work
in
a
commercial
enterprise
in
competition
with
other
commercial
enterprises
which
are
forced
to
pay
the
minimum
wage,
and
it
is
one
of
the
specific
purposes
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to...
and
i
quote
here:
"prevent
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
"
the
second
distinction
is
the
finding
of
the
district
court
here
that
many
of
these
associates
and
i
quote
again
from
the
record
"were
wholly
dependent
on
the
foundation
for
long
periods
of
time.
"
both
of
these
factors
would
distinguish
the
case
you
mentioned,
your
honor,
from
the
case
before
us
today.
mr.
charles
fried
the
record
certainly
does
speak.
there
is
certain
testimony,
principally
testimony
adduced
by
the
secretary
of
labor
from
former
employees,
from
former
associates,
which
speaks
at
some
length
about
those
hours
end
speaks
in
terms
of
very,
very
long
working
days
indeed,
12
and
14-hour
working
days,
six
and
seven
days
a
week.
but
the
actual
calculation
of
those
hours
is
a
matter
for
the
district
court
on
remand
and
does
not
concern
us.
mr.
charles
fried
it
would
in
at
the
extremes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
in
this
case
that
though
petitioners
repeat
that
their
businesses
did
not
run
at
a
profit...
and
they
say
this
again
and
again,
even
though
that
statement
is
unsubstantiated
by
anything
but
mr.
alamo's
testimony...
they
also
say
that
the
extensive
non-commercial
missionary
work
of
the
foundation
had
as
a
principal
source
of
support
these
commercial
businesses.
now,
i
think
those
two
statements
are
simply
contradictory.
and
businesses
which
are
able
to
support
such
extensive
missionary
activities
could
hardly
be
carried
on
on
a
merely
casual
basis.
furthermore,
there
is
testimony
from
ann
wiley,
for
instance,
to
the
effect
that
persons
were
assigned
to
their
work
in
the
businesses.
to
be
sure,
mr.
levy
who
testified
for
the
association,
testified
to
the
contrary;
that
he
did
work
in
the
restaurant
when
the
spirit
moved
him.
but
the
contradictory
testimony
is
that
that
work
was
done
pursuant
to
rather
careful
scheduling
under
the
direct
supervision
of
mr.
alamo.
what
we
contend
and
what
this
court
has
consistently
held
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
analogous
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that
who
is
an
employee
does
not
depend
on
self-designation.
in
fact,
the
whole
history
of
these
acts
is
a
history
of
various
arrangements
sought
to
be
designated
cooperative,
sought
to
be
designated
independent
contractors,
and
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
what
controls
is
the
economic
reality.
and
here
the
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
economic
reality
was
one
of
a
quid
pro
quo;
that
the
persons
received
shelter
and
housing...
and
i
quote
again...
"as
a
result
of
their
work.
"
that
finding
was
confirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and,
with
respect,
i
don't
believe
is
a
matter
for
review
in
this
court.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
a
computation
which
is
still
in
dispute
and
is
not
final.
indeed,
there
is
a
proceeding--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
statement
is
in
the
record
and
is
based
on
a
computation
by
the
secretary
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
directed
the
district
court
to
recompute
and
not
to
take
as
binding
in
any
sense.
so
that
matter
is
still
very
open.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
that
would
not
lead
to
a
different
outcome
necessarily,
because
of
the
language
which
i
have
already
quoted,
"accepting
the
unchallenged
findings"...
i
am
quoting
from
the
case
here...
"that
the
railroads
receive
no
immediate
advantage
from
any
work
done
by
the
trainees.
"
in
this
case,
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
the
foundation
received
no
immediate
benefit
from
the
work
done
by
the
associates
of
these
businesses.
mr.
charles
fried
we
would
vigorously
contest
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
profit
here.
to
be
sure,
to
be
sure
that
the
revenues,
the
profits
from
these
businesses
went
to
no
place
else
than
the
foundation,
but
that
is
not
a
test
for
profit.
indeed,
we
fail
to
understand
simply
as
a
matter
of
accounting
logic,
how
the
foundation
could
have
been
supported
out
of
the
revenues
from
these
businesses
if
they
did
not
produce
a
profit.
mr.
charles
fried
he
so
testified,
but
he
also
testified--
mr.
charles
fried
--your
honor--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
testimony
i
believe
contradicts
itself
because
if
what
happens
is
the
non-commercial
enterprises...
and
they
were
extensive...
supported
in
part
from
the
revenues
of
the
businesses,
then
it
must
follow
that
the
businesses
produce
revenues,
produce
revenues
in
excess
of
their
expenses,
because
otherwise
i
fail
to
understand
how
they
could
have
served
to
support
the
non-commercial
enterprises
which
were,
as
we
said,
extensive.
mr.
charles
fried
we
don't
dispute
that.
we
consider
it
irrelevant.
there
are
many
reasons
why
people
work.
and
i
hope
that
the
getting
of
a
wage
is
not
the
only
reason.
but
that
they
were
working
only
for
rehabilitation
is
what
we
would
dispute
in
the
face
of
the
district
court's
finding.
moreover,
rehabilitation
does
suggest
rehabilitation
for
something
else,
and
these
associates
worked
many
years
within
the
foundation.
it's
not
as
if
they
were
rehabilitated
and
then
went
on
for
work
elsewhere
in
the
economy,
as
was
the
case--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
it's
a
factor
that
helps,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
if
they
didn't
make
a
profit,
which
we
think
is
inconsistent
with
the
petitioner's
own
claims,
it
would
be
irrelevant,
because
we
don't
know
why
they
didn't
make
a
profit.
mr.
charles
fried
it
would
indeed.
they
may
not
have
made
a
profit
because
of
poor
management
or
because
some
or
all
of
the
persons
were
receiving
excessive
compensation.
no
way
of
knowing
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
we
have
no
substantial
quarrel
with
the
rationale
in
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
i
can
think
of
no
point
where
we
would
differ
with
the
court
of
appeals.
i
would
like
to
pass,
if
i
may,
to
the
petitioner's
claim
that
the
application
to
the
associates
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
violates
the
religion
clauses.
it's
rather
difficult
in
respect
to
the
associates
to
understand
precisely
what
the
burden
upon
them
is.
they
claim
at
one
point
that
it
would
prevent
them
from
being
free
to
contribute
their
labor,
but
of
course
that's
not
so.
they
are
free
to
contribute
to
their
labor;
what
they
are
not
free
to
do
is
to
exchange
their
labor
for
material
benefits
at
less
than
the
minimum
wage;
nor,
it
should
be
said,
is
there
anything
akin
to
a
vow
of
poverty.
indeed,
a
number
of
the
associates
testified
that
they
were
rather
proud
of
the
prosperity
of
the
foundation
and
of
the
prosperity
in
which
they
shared.
i
refer
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
mick
who
spoke
at
some
length
about
the
three
bedroom
house
and
washer
and
dryer
that
he
enjoyed.
this
was
not
a
monastic
arrangement.
so
perhaps
what
we
have
here
is
some
kind
of
an
entanglement
argument,
but
in
either
event,
this
is
a
case
where
this
court's
rationale
in
united
states
v.
lee
applies
and
applies
with
considerable
force.
here
we
have
a
compelling
state
interest
to
protect
against
substandard
wages
and
to
protect
against
"an
unfair
method
of
competition"
and
a
purpose
which
could
scarcely
be
pursued
without
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
statute,
more
so
than
in
lee,
because
it
is
not
merely
an
administrative
or
actuarial
comprehensiveness
that's
necessary.
what
is
necessary
is
to
protect
third
parties,
competing
businesses,
from
the
effect
of
substandard
wages
paid
by
a
competitor.
so
it's
hard
to
see
how
in
the
holdings
of
this
court,
from
the
jacobson
case
through
united
states
v.
lee,
we
would
not
see
a
compelling
state
purpose
in
this
case
which
could
not
readily
be
served
other
than
by
applying
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
the
foundation
and
the
associates.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
