mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
this
court
has
never
considered
a
discriminatory
tax
against
foreign
insurance
companies
in
which
the
state
has
presented
this
court
with
a
record
to
show
you
the
difference
in
benefits
conferred
on
the
citizens
of
that
state
by
the
domestic
companies
as
opposed
to
the
foreign
companies.
even
in
western
&
southern,
as
the
dissent
pointed
out,
there
was
no
difference
shown
between
domestic
companies
and
foreign
companies
insofar
as
the
state
of
california
was
shown.
it's
a
case
of
first
impression,
but
under
the
tests
that
this
court
has
framed
repeatedly...
such
as,
is
there
a
legitimate
state
purpose,
and
are
the
means
rationally
related
to
achieving
that
purpose...
our
statute
passes
muster.
the
foreign
insurance
companies
say
that
we
are
discriminating
here
on
the
basis
of
a
political
difference,
that
is
state
of
incorporation,
and
simply
we
are
raising
revenue
at
the
expense
of
out-of-state
corporations.
the
fact
is
our
statute
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
benefits
to
the
state
of
alabama.
not
only
must
you
incorporate
in
the
state
of
alabama;
you
must
also
locate
in
the
state
of
alabama.
and
if
you
don't
do
either
of
those,
you
will
have
to
pay
a
higher
tax,
which
may
be
reduced
by
investing
in
assets
in
the
state
of
alabama,
specified
assets.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
no,
sir,
it
never
will,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
discrimination
is
four
to
one
for
foreign
property
and
casualty
insurers
and
it's
three
to
one
for
life
insurers.
it
can
be
reduced
to
three
to
one
for
property
and
casualty
and
two
to
one
for
life.
it
can
never
be
the
same,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
domestic
insurers
are
different.
they
perform
a
different
service
to
alabama
and
to
the
insureds
in
alabama.
the
burden
we
say
here
is
on
the
foreign
insurance
companies
to
show
the
court
that
every
conceivable
purpose
that
could
be
behind
our
statute
and
to
negative
those
purposes.
if
they
fail
in
that
burden,
our
statute
is
due
to
be
upheld.
even
if
you
apply
a
lesser
burden
here
and
say
what
is
the
actual
purpose,
we
submit
to
you
that
you
can
get
the
actual
purpose
of
our
statute
from
reading
it
on
its
face.
it
encourages
the
formation
of
insurance
companies
in
alabama.
it
encourages
investment
in
alabama.
and
we
say
those
are
legitimate
state
purposes.
this
court
has
said
that.
this
court
most
recently
said
it
in
western
&
southern.
the
court
said
it
is
a
legitimate
state
purpose
to
promote
a
local
industry.
now,
the
foreign
insurers
say
you
must
take
it
one
more
step
and
say,
you
can
promote
that
local
industry
if
you
do
it
in
interstate
competition.
that's
not
what
this
court
said.
this
court
said
to
promote
a
local
industry.
it
so
happens
that
in
western
&
southern
those
california
insurance
companies
were
benefited
in
the
interstate
market.
it
so
happens
in
our
case
the
alabama
companies
are
benefited
in
their
intrastate
market
and
in
their
early
formative
years,
when
they
need
a
tax
shelter,
we
submit
to
this
court,
and
the
evidence
is
before
you
that
this
is
true.
the
western
&
southern
case
is
the
test
that
this
court
has
given
us,
and
we
passed
that
test
by
looking
for
a
legitimate
state
purpose...
promotion
of
a
local
industry...
and
have
we
used
a
reasonable
means
to
get
there.
the
commerce
clause
is
designed
to
promote
federalism.
the
equal
protection
clause
has
never
been
an
instrument
of
federalism.
this
court
has
said
the
equal
protection
clause
has
never
been
given
that
characteristic.
it
is
simply
to
assure
equal
treatment
for
those
entities
in
the
same
classification.
so
you
come
to
the
matter
of
classification
here,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
the
states
are
free
to
classify
as
they
see
fit,
especially
in
the
area
of
taxation.
the
states
have
the
widest
possible
latitude
to
classify
in
the
area
of
taxation.
and
the
burden
is
here
on
the
foreign
insurance
companies
to
show
you
that
the
classification
is
not
rational,
is
not
reasonable.
in
fact,
this
court
has
said
from
time
to
time
the
burden
is
on
them
to
show
you
that
it's
palpably
arbitrary,
that
it
has
no
rational
basis,
and
it's
not
reasonably
related
to
achieving
the
purpose
that
we
have
here.
really,
it's
a
higher
burden
on
them
than
that.
they're
supposed
to
show
you
that
our
legislature
couldn't
rationally
have
believed
that
classification
would
accomplish
the
purpose.
if
you
assume
in
the
abstract
that
promotion
of
local
industry
and
encouraging
investment
are
legitimate
state
purposes,
with
all
the
benefits
attendant
on
those
two
goals,
then
you
come
to
whether
the
means
chosen
by
our
legislature
are
rationally
related
to
that.
and
they've
said
you
must
incorporate,
locate
your
principal
place
of
business
there,
or
else
pay
a
higher
tax,
unless
you
reduce
it
by
investments.
as
to
whether
those
means,
those
classifications,
are
reasonably
related
to
achieving
our
purpose,
we
have
about
120
pages
of
facts
that
have
been
stipulated
to
by
the
foreign
insurance
companies.
they
say
it--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--that's
it,
that's
the
basic
purpose.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
we're
saying
that
they're
different,
justice
white,
that
they're
different
in
what
they
do.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
under
the
facts
that
are
before
you,
that
are
admitted
by
the
foreign
insurers,
domestic
insurance
companies
perform
differently.
they
sell
different
kinds
of
insurance,
they
sell
it
in
different
areas.
they
get
in
the
rural
parts
of
alabama
and
sell
it,
where
the
foreign
companies
won't
operate.
they
don't
have
the
agents
in
those
rural
counties
that
the
domestic
ones
do.
the
domestic
companies
sell
smaller
policies.
they
sell
industrial
insurance.
the
system
is
working.
alabama
has
more
insurance
per
capita,
more
industrial
insurance,
than
any
state
in
the
union.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
because
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
benefits
to
the
state
of
alabama
and
to
the
market
place.
the
system...
we
say
to
you
the
system
is
working.
the
foreign
insurance
companies
have
a
dominant
share
of
the
market
in
alabama.
they
have
75
percent
of
the
life
market
and
87
percent
of
the
casualty
market.
so
they're
doing
well.
it's
not
as
though
we
were
excluding
them
at
the
state
line.
maybe
our
tax
is
not
accomplishing
what
we
might
like
it
to,
but
we
have,
as
a
result
of
the
statute
and
as
a
result
of
this
tax
shelter
to
these
young
companies
who
cannot
make
it
without
a
tax
shelter,
we
have
a
healthy
competitive
mix.
and
the
marketplace
benefits
from
having
that
mix
of
foreign
insurers
and
a
healthy
domestic
insurance
industry.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
it's
because
of
the
economics
of
scale
and
because
of
the
capital
requirements,
and
these
facts
are
all
admitted
by
the
foreign
insurance
companies.
they
say
it
doesn't
matter,
but
they
went
on
and
admitted
these
facts.
and
we've
had
a
computer
model
run
in
the
appendix,
and
it
shows
that
a
domestic
company
that
doesn't
have
this
tax
shelter,
this
advantage
in
its
early
years,
probably
won't
make
it.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
i
think
that
the
domestic
companies
can
tailor
their
sales
force
and
their
policies
to
the
needs
of
the
local
populace.
and
i
think
that's
what
congress
said
when
they
passed
mccarran-ferguson.
i
think
they
said
the
business
of
insurance
is
local
and
is
suited
to
local
regulation
and
taxation.
they
didn't
just
say
regulation,
of
course;
they
said
taxation
and
regulation.
and
it
is
local.
the
insurance
industry
is
different,
it's
unique.
it
depends
on
getting
out
and
serving
the
public.
industrial
insurance
policies,
as
your
honor
may
know,
are
sold
by
door
to
door
solicitation
and
collection,
and
the
big
companies
won't
do
that,
for
one
reason
or
another.
some
of
them
do,
but
primarily
the
foreign
insurance
companies
won't
do
that.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
do
know
that
far
more
industrial
coverage
results
from
our
domestic
companies.
that
statistic
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
i
could
find
that
statistic.
it's
in
the
facts,
but
i
don't
know
right
now
whether
metropolitan
does
it
still
or
not.
what
happens
is
this.
we
have
a
domestic
industry
that's
fostered
by
this
tax
shelter
and
we
get
the
payrolls
that
a
domestic
industry,
that
a
healthy
domestic
industry
brings.
we
get
the
multiplier
effect
of
those
payrolls.
we
get
investment
in
the
state,
we
get
bank
accounts.
all
of
those
facts
are
given
in
this
case
and
all
of
them
are
in
the
appendix.
if
we
see
that...
if
we
have
the
foreign
insurers
concede
that
insurance
coverage
is
a
good
thing,
we
see
that
alabama
has
far
more
policies
per
capita
than
the
rest
of
the
nation
as
a
whole;
that
new
insurance
companies
are
being
formed
in
the
states
with
discriminatory
statutes
far
more
rapidly
than
in
those
states
without
discriminatory
statutes.
there
are
32
states
like
us
in
varying
degrees,
and
this
comes
from
the
foreign
insurers'
appendix.
32
states
have
this
system
in
one
form
or
another.
it
discriminates.
it's
in
those
discriminatory
statute
states
that
insurance
companies
are
choosing
to
incorporate,
and
it
must
be
because
of
the
tax
shelter
that's
offered.
in
the
last
20
years,
we've
had
500,
a
net
gain
of
500
insurance
companies.
89
percent
of
those
have
chosen
to
locate
in
states
with
discriminatory
tax
statutes.
so
we
get
the
benefit
of
the
niches
of
the
local
populace
being
served
that
would
otherwise
go
unserved.
we
get
the
investment
in
the
state.
we
get
the
payrolls
and
bank
accounts.
and
yet
at
the
same
time
we
can
have
a
prospering
foreign
insurance
industry.
they're
doing
extremely
well.
they
just
want
to
do
better.
the
last
statistic
bears
on
the
reasonableness
of
our
statute.
it's
four
to
one
and
it's
three
to
one,
and
counsel
for
the
foreign
insurers
says
that
like
it's
a
terrible
discrimination,
and
it
may
be.
but
we
submit
to
you
it's
reasonable
and
rational
and
it's
working.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
as
i
read
it,
your
honor,
it
takes
the
business
of
insurance
out
from
under
the
protection
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
it
gave,
as
i
understand
it,
the
states
the
power
to
tax
and
regulate.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
yes,
sir,
it
did
say
that.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
i
think
this
court
has
said
on
occasion
that
it
would
look
at
congressional
enactments
for
public
policy.
i
think
it
does
state
a
public
policy.
i
think
it's
evidence
to
you
that
the
insurance
industry
is
different,
or
at
least
congress
views
it
as
different
and
unique.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
it
cited
wheeling
steel
versus
glander.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
wheeling
steel
was
'49.
reserve
life
against
bowers
was
'59.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
that
was
after.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
both
of
those
are
after.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
not
at
all.
no
mistake
was
made.
the
job
wasn't
done.
the
guidance
was
not
given
to
this
court
by
the
states.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
residence
and
location.
i
would
have
a
harder
argument
to
make,
your
honor,
if
we
just
said,
wherever
you
incorporate,
we'll
determine
your
tax.
they
must
not
only
incorporate,
they
must
locate.
we
want
them
in
there.
and
i
can
distinguish
those
seven
cases,
and
i
don't
want
to
do
it
if
you
don't
want
me
to.
but
the
wheeling
steel
against
glander
said,
the
purpose
of
our
statute
is
to
encourage
reciprocity.
this
court
said:
you've
given
us
your
purpose;
we
don't
find
it
to
be
a
legitimate
one,
we
strike
it
down.
reserve
life
against
bowers,
here's
what
happened.
the
court
of
appeals
of
ohio
found
the
tax
in
ohio--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--i
would
say
it
would
be
a
harder
case
than
the
one
i
have
here,
because--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--sir?
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
no,
i
don't
think
reserve
would
control
that,
for
this
reason.
the
lower
courts
in
reserve
found
the
statute
to
be
non-discriminatory.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
wheeling
was
an
ad
valore
tax.
it
was
not
in
the
insurance--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--wheeling
would
not
control
because
the
statute
there
was
to
encourage
reciprocity.
we
don't
say
that.
we
say
we
have
a
valid
distinct
between
domestic
and
foreign,
and
that
you've
got
evidence
before
you
that
none
of
the
other
courts.
in
the
greene
case
he's
talking--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--that's
right.
it
was
a
manufacturing
company
and
out-of-state
receipts,
accounts
receivable,
were
taxed
at
a
higher
rate
the
out-in-state
accounts
receivable.
the
greene
case
is
the
first
case
that
the
like
to
cite.
the
greene
case
court
looked
five
times
to
see
if
there
was
a
distinction
between
out-of-state
railroads
and
in-state
railroads.
five
time
the
greene
court
looked
and
five
times
the
court
said:
no
distinction
has
been
shown.
they
are
in
the
identical
business.
they
perform
it
in
precisely
the
same
manner.
another
time
they
said
exactly
the
same
manner.
the
court
was
searching
for
a
distinction
on
which
a
classification
could
be
based,
and
it
found
none.
the
same
thing
was
true
in
the
two
insurance
cases,
hanover
fire
and
concordia.
the
state
of
illinois
came
in
with
discriminatory
statute
against
insurance
companies,
1926.
this
court
struck
it
down,
because
it
received
no
guidance
from
the
state
illinois
as
to
why
a
distinction
existed.
was
one
better
than
the
other
for
the
citizens
of
illinois?
and
this
court
was
not
shown
any
difference
and
it
struck
it
down.
eight
years
later,
he
talks
about
concordia.
this
court
again
considered
illinois,
same
state,
and
they
hadn't
learned
anything
in
the
interim.
they
came
in
and
gave
you
a
statute
and
they
said,
we
discriminate
against
foreign
companies
in
favor
of
domestic,
and
they
gave
you
no
reasons
why.
they
gave
you
no
distinctions.
this
court
said
in
concordia:
no
distinction,
no
reasonable
basis
for
such
discrimination,
is
suggested
and
none
is
perceived.
the
court
was
searching
for
the
distinctions
that
we
have
before
you
in
this
case,
and
this
is
the
first
time
it's
been
done.
this
court
in
glassboro,
whhy
against
glassboro,
same
questions
came
up.
they
said,
is
there
a
difference
in
new
jersey's
relation
to
the
decisive
transaction?
three
times
the
court
asked
in
whhy
against
glassboro:
is
there
any
distinction
between
the
two?
it
was
a
non-profit
corporation
that
was
taxed
if
it
was
from
out-of-state
and
new
jersey
didn't
tax
its
own
non-profit
corporations.
this
court
said
no
distinction
is
shown
in
the
benefits
to
the
state
of
new
jersey.
another
time
it
said,
no
one
has
advanced
any
difference,
so
we
find
none.
they
said
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
difference
in
benefits
is
shown
to
exist.
so
glassboro
is
the
same
thing.
bethlehem
against
flynt
is
another
case
that's
cited
in
their
seven
cases.
in
that
case,
the
north
carolina
statute
was
held
to
reach
too
far.
it
was
irrational.
the
north
carolina
statute
said
an
out-of-state
corporation
must
come
in
and,
in
order
to
relieve
itself
of
the
tax,
invest
75
percent
of
its
assets
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
even
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina
said
that's
a
futile
and
unworkable
plan,
and
this
court
agreed
with
him.
there
was
no
rational
basis
shown
there
in
what
the
state
of
north
carolina
was
trying
to
accomplish.
so
we
think
the
cases
are
consistent,
that
the
cases
can
be
reconciled.
we
think
the
test
is
given
in
western
&
southern.
we
say
you
would
not
be
departing
from
precedent
if
you
uphold
alabama's
tax.
you
wouldn't
be
flying
in
the
face
of
those
seven
decisions
cited
by
the
insurance
companies.
the
policy
announced
by
mccarran-ferguson
was
that
uniformity
in
the
taxation
of
insurance
companies
is
not
desirable,
it's
not
in
the
public
interest.
and
the
legitimacy
of
our
state
statute
lies
partly
in
that
uniqueness
of
the
insurance
industry
and
what
we
have,
what
we
want
to
achieve.
32
states
have
found
it
a
workable
system.
20
of
those
states
have
come
in
and
filed
an
amicus
brief
with
you
saying:
don't
change
the
system.
we
have
one,
it
works;
don't
change
it.
various
members
of
the
insurance
industry
have
come
in.
allstate
and
state
farm,
two
of
the
largest
insurance
companies
in
the
world,
have
come
in
and
filed
as
amici
our
side,
saying:
don't
change
it.
we
pay
that
four
to
one
when
we
go
to
alabama.
we're
discriminated
when
we
go
into
alabama.
it's
a
good
system;
don't
change
it.
the
florida
association
of
insurance
companies,
the
national
association
of
insurance
companies
has
come
in.
that's
521
members.
they
say
it
works,
don't
change
it.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
the
system
works.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
it
works
because
we
encourage
domestic
companies--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--we
have
a
healthy
domestic
insurance
industry
that
serves
one
segment
and
certain
types
of
insurance
needs,
and
we
have
a
very,
very
healthy
foreign
industry
that
serves
other
needs.
there
is
a
difference,
there
is
a
distinction.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
well,
as
i
understand
it,
connecticut
has
the
big
companies
incorporated
in
connecticut
and
they
tax
domestics
more
than
foreigns,
and
they
don't
want
to
see...
they'd
like
our
law
changed
so
their
domestic
companies
can
compete
better.
they're
looking
after
their
domestic
carriers,
too.
and
i
don't
blame
them
for
coming
in
on
that
side.
32
states
feel
the
same
way
we
do,
and
20
of
them
are
here
before
you.
the
intervenors
in
this
case,
those
are
five
domestic
carriers.
now,
they're
penalized
when
they
go
outside
the
state
in
interstate
commerce.
when
they
go
outside
in
interstate
competition,
they
are
hurt
because
of
retaliatory
taxes.
but
they
get
the
benefit
of
our
taxes
at
the
early
years
when
they
otherwise
couldn't
survive.
that
tax
shelter
enables
them,
when
they
are
fledgling
companies,
to
make
it,
and
that's
the
only
way
some
of
them
can
make
it.
five
of
those
domestic
carriers
are
here
before
you
as
intervenors.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
yes,
sir,
i'm
not
trying
to
come
up
with--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--a
weight
of
numbers.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
well,
on
that
point,
your
honor,
the
foreign
insurance
companies
say
they
get
taxed
without
representation
in
alabama.
they
have
a
lot
more
agents
in
alabama
than
the
domestic
carriers
do.
they've
got
the
votes
and
they've
got
the
lobbying.
they're
not
being
unrepresented
down
there.
justice
marshall,
the
only
reason
i
cite
those
statistics
is
to
say
to
you
that
we
have
a
reasonable
system.
it's
a
rational
system.
if
we
taxed
them
20
to
one
it
would
be
irrational
and
unreasonable.
it'd
be
like
bethlehem
against
flynt.
it
wouldn't
give
you
that
healthy
competitive
mix
that
you
have
in
the
alabama
marketplace.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
yes,
sir.
and
all
i
say
on
that
point
is,
we
feel
it's
reasonable
and
we're
not
alone
in
feeling
that
it's
a
reasonable
system,
and
it's
a
system
that's
widespread
and
seems
to
be
working
not
only
in
alabama
but
in
other
locations.
the
foreign
insurance
companies
really
are
asking
this
court
to
repeal
mccarran-ferguson.
what
they're
saying
is
use
the
equal
protection
scrutiny,
which
is
minimal
scrutiny,
as
this
court
has
said
repeatedly,
use
that
scrutiny
to
enhance
interstate
competition.
and
that
is
not
what
this
court
has
said.
in
allied
stores
against
bowers,
this
court
upheld
an
ohio
statute
that
discriminated
against
non-residents...
that
discriminated
against
residents
in
favor
of
non-residents.
and
in
the
concurring
opinion,
justice
brennan,
in
allied
stores
against
bowers
you
said
the
only
way
to
reconcile
this
decision
with
wheeling
steel
against
glanders
is
if
equal
protection
is
used
as
an
instrument
of
federalism.
and
then
you
cited
that
concurring
opinion
in
footnote
21
of
western
&
southern
and
said
that
view
has
never
been
endorsed
by
this
court,
this
court
has
never
said
that
equal
protection
is
to
be
used
as
a
tool
of
federalism.
and
that
i
take
it
is
the
view
of
this
court.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
sir?
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
in
allied
stores,
i
know.
justice
harlan
joined
with
you,
i
believe.
and
i
think
this
court
has
drawn
the
distinction
between
equal
protection
scrutiny
and
commerce
clause
analysis,
and
this
court
has
never
said
that
you
intrude...
that
you
put
commerce
clause
analysis
into
an
equal
protection
scrutiny.
to
do
so
is
to
confuse
the
two
different
analyses,
one
being
to
enhance
commerce
interstate
and
the
other
being
to
ensure
equal
treatment
for
persons
in
the
same
classification.
and
it's
our
job
to
tell
you
that
the
classification
here
has
a
basis,
a
rational,
reasonable
basis,
and
it's
done
on
a
distinction
that's
admitted.
the
classification
is
admittedly
rational
and
reasonable
by
stipulation
of
the
other
side.
they
want
you
to
change
the
system,
the
system
in
alabama
that
is
working
and
that
has
created
jobs,
payrolls,
and
insurance
coverage.
they
want
you
to
change
that
and
give
them
a
more
dominant
market
share.
they
want
more
than
the
75
and
the
87
percent
that
they
presently
have.
and
the
domestic
insurance
industry
is
asking
you
not
to
change
it,
and
the
domestic
insurance
carriers
cannot
survive
unless
they
have
a
statute
that
aids
them
like
this
one
does.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
it
gives
a
tax
break
to
the--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--yes.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
because
in
the
early
years
they
have
enormous
capital
requirements.
the
two
barriers
to
entry
are
capital
requirements
and
economies
of
scale.
they
don't
have
either
one
of
those
in
those
early
years.
the
foreign
insurers
do.
by
the
time
they
come
into
the
alabama
marketplace,
they're
bigger.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
that's
right,
and
what
that
does
is
benefit
the
marketplace.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
it
helps
the
consumer.
that
fact
is
stipulated
in
the
joint
appendix,
that
you
get
more
attractive
rates
by
a
healthy
domestic
industry
that
doesn't
have
to
pay
that
four
percent
and
that
three
percent.
they
can
charge
lower
premiums
and
the
foreign
insurers
have
to
meet
that.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
and
the
consumer--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
except
that
they're
doing
very
well.
apparently
they
can
meet
it.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
the
answer
is
they
are
able
to
overcome
that,
that
advantage.
we
admittedly
give
an
advantage
to
the
domestic
carriers,
but
the
foreign
carriers
are
able
to
overcome
it
and
to
even--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--the
consumer
is
benefited
by
having
more
attractive
rates.
if
the
domestic
industry
can
sell
at
cheaper
rates
and
the
foreigns
have
to
meet
that,
the
consumer
is
benefited.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
ultimately
it's
the
alabama
citizens.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
well,
i
think
that's
part
of
the
same
purpose.
obviously,
if
we
have--
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
--i
think
all
of
the
alabama
marketplace.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
those
are
one
of
our
17.
we
gave
you
17
purposes,
and
part
of
that
is
the
insured
himself.
mr.
warren
b.
lightfoot
there
are
a
number
of...
that's
what
this
court
has
said,
that
they
must
play
that
piano
and
negative
every
one
of
those
keys,
and
i
think
that's
the
burden
you've
put
on
them
in
your
previous
decisions.
and
i
don't
think
they've
met
that
here,
and
they've
stipulated
to
some
facts
that
in
fact
show
you
the
very
contrary.
thank
you.
