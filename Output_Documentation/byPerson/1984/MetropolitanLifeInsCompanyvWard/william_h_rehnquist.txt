justice
rehnquist
in
its
equal
protection
cases?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
zinn,
i
take
it
you
have
to
concede
that
in
this
case
protectionist
purposes
in
light
of
the
commerce
clause,
the
fact
you
can't
rely
on
the
commerce
clause,
are
permissible
for
the
state?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
just
arguing
perhaps
from
the
point
of
view
cf
res
nova
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
you
know,
something
that
hadn't
been
decided
before,
if
you
can't
claim
that
a
protectionist
purpose
is
illegitimate
under
the
commerce
clause,
any
legislative
purpose
is
legitimate,
virtually,
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
matter
with
it
as
a
matter
of
logic?
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
rational
basis
is
all
about.
isn't
it
a
very
easily
satisfied
requirement?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
isn't
this
business
of
the
commerce
clause
and
not
the
equal
protection
clause
to
protect
against
local
favoritism?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
zinn,
do
you
think
those
cases
that
are
pre-mccarran-ferguson
act
and
don't
deal
with
insurance
are
really
relevant
here?
justice
rehnquist
but
was
that
all
spelled
out
in
the
reserve
life
case,
the
1965
case,
that
although
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
apply
because
of
mccarran-ferguson,
we
nonetheless--
justice
rehnquist
--but
if
that's
the
correct
state
of
the
law,
then
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
is
almost
meaningless,
because
although
you
can't...
they've
lifted
the
commerce,
congress
has
lifted
the
commerce
clause
bar
to
state
regulation
of
insurance,
the
equal
protection
clause
in
your
view
kicks
in
and
does
just
the
same
thing
as
the
commerce
clause.
justice
rehnquist
well,
wheeling
didn't
even
involve
insurance.
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
it
works?
