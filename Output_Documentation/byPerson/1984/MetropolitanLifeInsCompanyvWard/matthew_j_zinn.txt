mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
at
issue
is
the
validity
of
alabama's
domestic
preference
tax
statute
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
alabama
grants
a
tax
preference
to
domestic
life
insurance
companies
by
imposing
a
tax
of
one
percent
on
their
gross
premiums,
while
imposing
a
tax
of
three
percent
or
three
times
that
amount
on
the
gross
premiums
of
out-of-state
life
insurance
companies.
alabama
grants
a
tax
preference
to
domestic
property
casualty
insurance
companies
by
imposing
a
tax
on
their
gross
premiums
of
one
percent
and
imposing
a
tax
on
the
gross
premiums
of
out-of-state
property
casualty
companies
of
four
times
that
amount
or
four
percent.
so
in
its
basic
structure
the
alabama
domestic
preference
tax
statute
provides
for
taxing
out-of-state
life
companies
at
triple
the
rate
of
domestic
life
companies
and
providing
for
taxing
out-of-state
property
casualty
companies
at
quadruple
the
rate
of
domestic
companies.
the
alabama
domestic
preference
tax
statute
also
contains
a
so-called
investment
incentive
provision.
under
this
provision,
an
out-of-state
company
can
reduce
its
tax
by
one-tenth
of
one
percent
for
each
one
percent
of
its
total
assets
that
it
invests
in
alabama.
however,
there's
a
limitation
on
the
amount
of
the
reduction.
the
maximum
reduction
cannot
exceed
one
percentage
point,
and
this
occurs
if
an
out-of-state
company
invests
ten
percent
or
more
of
its
total
assets
in
alabama.
what
this
means
is
that
if
an
out-of-state
company
takes
maximum
advantage
of
the
investment
incentive,
if
it's
a
life
insurance
company
it
can
then
reduce
its
tax
rate
four
four
percent...
from
three
percent
to
two
percent,
or
double
the
rate
of
a
domestic
company;
and
if
it's
a
property
casualty
insurance
company,
it
can
then
reduce
its
tax
rate
from
three
percent
to
two
percent...
four
percent
to
three
percent,
or
triple
the
rate
of
a
domestic
company.
now,
these
suits
for
refund
were
brought
in
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
for
refund
of
the
discriminatory
taxes.
the
appellants
here
are
a
number
of
out-of-state
insurance
companies
that
do
a
nationwide
business,
including
business
in
alabama.
the
appellees
are
the
insurance
commissioner
of
alabama,
who
denied
appellants'
claims
for
refund,
and
several
alabama
insurance
companies
which
intervened
in
these
proceedings
below.
the
ultimate
issue
is
whether
alabama's
domestic
preference
tax
statue
satisfies
the
rational
basis
test
of
equal
protection
review.
in
holding
that
it
did,
the
courts
below
found
that
at
least
two
of
the
17
purposes
advanced
by
the
appellees
were
legitimate
state
purposes
that
justified
the
discrimination
inherent
in
the
statute.
these
were:
first,
encouraging
the
formation
of
new
insurance
companies
in
alabama;
and
second,
encouraging
capital
investment
in
alabama
by
out-of-state
companies.
our
position
is
that
in
the
context
of
this
case
involving
domestic
preference
taxation
neither
these
two
purposes
nor
any
of
the
other
purposes
advanced
by
alabama
are
legitimate
state
purposes
as
that
term
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
pardon
me?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
we
believe
that
three
major
considerations
should
guide
decision
in
this
case.
the
first
of
these
is
that
this
precise
issue
has
been
considered
by
this
court
on
seven
occasions
and
on
each
of
those
seven
occasions
domestic
preference
taxation
has
been
held
to
violate
equal
protection.
now,
the
appellees
contend
that
these
cases
were
really
commerce
clause
cases
and
that
the
purposes
that
they
are
putting
forward
were
not
put
before
the
court
in
these
seven
cases.
so
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
these
cases
are
on
point.
a
great
deal
of
discussion
of
the
cases
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--oh,
yes.
we
rely
exclusively
on
the
equal
protection
clause,
justice
rehnquist.
but
these
seven
cases
that
we
rely
upon
were
all
equal
protection
cases.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
would
say
that
that
is
the
position
the
appellees
are
putting
forward.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
if
you
state
the
purpose
at
a
level
of
generality,
such
as
a
purpose
to
encourage
rural
insurance,
to
pick
one
of
the
17
purposes
that
the
appellees
have
identified...
that
is
one
of
their
17.
they
say
that
there
is
a
lack
of
insurance
in
rural
areas.
if
you
say
that
that's
the
purpose
and
then
the
statistics
show
that
domestic
companies
are
servicing
rural
areas,
therefore
you're
furthering
the
purpose,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
the
equal
protection
clause
falls
between
the
two-pronged
test
that
this
court
is
applying.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
our
stress
here...
yes,
i
think
that
is.
but
our
stress
here
is
on
the
legitimacy
of
the
purpose,
and
what
we
are
saying
is...
let
me
see
if
i
can
put
a
hypothetical,
justice
rehnquist.
suppose
instead
of
the
statute
that
we
were
dealing
with,
we
had
a
statute
that
started
all
property
casualty
insurance
companies
out
at
a
four
percent
rate,
but
that
provided
that
if
you
sold
a
lot
of
rural
insurance
then
you
would
be
reduced
to
a
one
percent
rate.
and
suppose
also
that
that
for
opportunity
reduction
to
one
percent
was
available
only
to
domestic
companies.
now,
we
would
submit
in
that
situation
that,
sure
you've
passed
the
rationalist
test,
but
the
only
reason
for
confining
the
incentive
to
domestic
companies
is
local
favoritism,
and
that
favoritism
has
always
been
held
in
violation
of
equal
protection.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
i
think
also
there
is
a
purpose
here
to
treat
people
that
are
similarly
circumstanced
in
the
same
way.
there
is
no
reason--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
prior
to
the
noon
recess,
justice
rehnquist
had
asked
a
question
as
to
why
it
isn't
okay
to
help
domestic
companies.
i
guess
our
answer
is
that
if
that
is
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
statute
it's
not
okay
because
it
simply
restates
the
discrimination.
now,
if
it's
not
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
statute,
as
is
suggested
by
the
state's
17
purposes
in
this
case,
and
you
look
at
those
17
purposes,
you
will
find
that
foreign
companies
can
contribute
to
those
goals
just
as
domestic
companies
can.
and
i
put
the
hypothetical
before
the
noon
recess
of
a
statute
that
imposed
a
four
percent
tax
on
both
foreign
companies
and
domestic
companies,
but
which
allowed
a
reduction
to
one
percent
if,
for
example,
a
large
number
of
rural
policies
were
sold,
but
limited
that
possibility
to
domestic
companies.
in
that
situation
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
only
purpose
of
that
statute
could
be
to
favor
domestic
companies,
because
there's
no
reason
other
than
that
that
could
explain
the
discrimination
inherent
in
the
statute.
seven
times
this
court
has
had
this
issue
before
it
and
seven
times
it
has
held
that
domestic
preference
taxes
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
as
we
discussed
prior
to
the
noon
recess,
the
appellees
contend
that
these
cases
are
not
on
point
for
two
reasons.
first,
they
say
they're
commerce
clause
cases;
and
second,
they
say
that
the
purposes
they
are
putting
forward,
these
17
purposes,
were
never
put
forward
before.
both
of
these
contentions,
we
submit,
are
without
merit.
there
is
long
discussion
in
all
of
the
briefs
of
these
17
cases...
of
these
seven
cases,
and
i
will
just
touch
on
a
few
highlights.
southern
railway
versus
greene
was
the
first
of
the
seven
cases,
and
the
appellees
make
much
of
the
fact
that
in
that
1910
decision
two
commerce
clause
cases
were
cited.
but
those
two
cases
were
cited
only
on
the
question
of
whether
the
privilege
tax
doctrine
was
applicable.
once
the
court
decided
that
the
privilege
tax
doctrine
was
not
applicable,
the
rest
of
the
discussion
in
southern
railway
versus
greene
was
equal
protection.
in
fact,
the
court
said
in
that
case,
75
years
ago,
that
for
a
classification
to
be
valid
under
the
equal
protection
it
must
bear
"a
reasonable
and
just
relation
to
the
things
in
respect
of
which
such
classification
is
imposed.
"
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
absolutely.
this
is
the
eighth
case
that's
come
up
in
this
line
of
cases,
justice
rehnquist.
half
of
them
have
been
insurance
cases
and
half
have
not.
but
in
every
one
of
them,
insurance
or
not,
the
court
has
always
framed
its
decision
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
next
two
cases,
the
next
two
cases
in
this
line,
the
hanover
fire
and
concordia
fire
cases
in
1926
and
1934,
were
decided
at
a
time
when
this
court
did
not
consider
the
business
of
insurance
to
be
commerce.
they
could
only
be...
they
could
only
have
rested
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
the
reserve
life
case,
which
came
on
in
1965,
was
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
southeastern
underwriters
case
had
held
that
the
business
of
insurance
was
commerce,
and
after
congress
had
then
enacted
the
mccarran
act
and
lifted
all
commerce
clause
restraints.
they're
not
explainable
except
on
equal
protection.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
appellees
have
argued
that
we
are
placing
too
much
weight
on
the
reserve
life
case,
because
it
didn't
spell
all
this
cut.
that
we
think
might
be
fair
criticism
if
this
were
the
only
case
in
this
line,
justice
rehnquist.
but
it's
one
of
seven.
and
i
would
point
out
that,
although
there
were
dissents
in
some
of
these
seven
cases,
not
one
dissent
in
all
of
these
seven
cases
ever
rested
on
the
basis
that
this
classification
was
reasonable,
not
one
dissent.
seven
times
since
1910
and
not
a
single
justice
that
has
heard
these
seven
cases
has
ever
said
the
classification
was
reasonable.
i
think
it's
also
particularly
significant,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
reserve
life
case
came
after
wheeling
steel
in
the
sequence
of
cases.
wheeling
steel
was
decided
in
1949,
and
i
think
it's
a
notable
decision
of
this
court
for
various
reasons.
the
case
was
decided
by
a
seven
to
two
vote.
the
dissent
in
that
case
was
written
by
justice
douglas
and
justice
black
joined
in
it.
the
dissent
was
on
the
ground
that
the
equal
protection
clause
did
not
apply
to
corporations.
justice
jackson
wrote
for
the
majority
in
that
case
and
he
also,
in
an
unusual
procedure,
filed
a
separate
statement
dealing
exclusively
with
the
views
of
the
dissenting
justices.
in
his
opinion
for
the
court,
in
which
the
domestic
preference
tax
issue
and
classification
was
raised,
he
made
what
i
think
is
the
clearest
statement
of
what
the
rule
of
this
court
has
been
for
75
years.
he
said
that
in
the
area
of
taxation
"the
federal
right
of
a
non-resident
is
the
right
to
equal
treatment.
"
with
that
clear
statement
in
the
prior
case,
it
seems
to
us
understandable
that
the
court
felt
comfortable
in
disposing
of
the
reserve
life
case
as
it
did,
in
a
per
curiam
opinion.
moreover,
we
would
point
out--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--wheeling
steel
versus
glander.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
would
not
agree
with
that.
there
are
two
major
taxes
that
apply
to
the
insurance
industry,
state
taxes.
one
is
the
domestic
preference
tax
that's
in
issue
in
this
case.
we
would
agree
that
in
this
particular
situation
the
equal
protection
clause
would
do
what
the
commerce
clause
would
do.
but
three
years
ago
this
court
considered
retaliatory
taxes
and
it
held
that
they
passed
equal
protection
review.
on
the
other
hand,
in
that
case
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
would
not
pass
commerce
clause
review.
in
fact,
the
appellees
conceded
that.
so
we
would
have
to
disagree
that
the
tests
simply
coincide
and
that
the
mccarran
act
doesn't
mean
anything.
i
want
to
mention
again
that
the
seventh
case
in
the
line
of
cases
that
we
are
relying
upon
was
the
whyy
case,
which
came
three
years
after
reserve
life,
and
in
that
case
as
well
the
court
felt
comfortable
with
a
per
curiam
opinion,
and
it
cited
the
reserve
life
case
along
with
wheeling
steel
and
several
of
the
other
cases
in
this
line.
so
we
don't
think
there
could
be
any
question,
really,
that
these
seven
cases
are
dead
on
point,
and
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
in
this
case
it's
going
to
have
to
overrule
seven
of
its
own
precedents,
dating
back
to
1910.
now,
going
again
to
the
question
of
whether--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--absolutely,
and
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
appellees
make
in
this
case
is
that
they
say
it
is
more
difficult
to
regulate
out-of-state
companies
than
it
is
domestic
companies.
we
don't
agree
with
that.
but
even
if
it's
true,
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
you
can
tax
out-of-state
companies
more
for
that
reason.
there's
no
relationship
between
the
two.
let
me
turn
again
to
the
reserve
life
case,
because
i
think
it
is
very
instructive.
we
have
in
an
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement
submitted
the
brief
that
ohio
filed
in
the
reserve
life
case,
and
we
have
also
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
the
transcript
of
the
oral
argument
in
the
reserve
life
case,
and
we
have
excerpted
that
transcript,
the
relevant
portions
of
it,
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
the
merits
on
pages
13a
to
16a.
now,
in
this
case
the
court
below
found
that
one
of
the
primary...
one
of
the
two
purposes
that
justified
domestic
preference
taxation
in
alabama
was
"encouraging
the
formation
of
domestic
insurance
companies
in
alabama.
"
that's
at
page
9a
of
the
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement.
now,
on
page
59a
of
the
same
appendix
appears
the
ohio
brief,
and
ohio
argued
that
its
purpose
was
"to
encourage
the
location
of
insurance
companies
in
ohio.
"
--almost
the
same
words.
and
the
oral
argument
is
to
the
same
effect.
on
page
15a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
the
merits,
the
counsel
for
ohio
argued
that
the
state
of
ohio
had
"a
desire
to
foster
the
development
and
creation
of
insurance
companies
within
the
state.
"
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
the
same
page
he
said
"the
state
of
ohio,
in
seeking
to
encourage
the
location
and
development
of
insurance
companies
in
the
state
of
ohio.
"
and
then
finally,
on
the
bottom
of
page
16a,
the
last
page
that
we
excerpt,
counsel
said
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
ohio
intends
"to
encourage
the
location
of
insurance
companies
in
the
state
of
ohio.
"
this
case
is,
we
submit,
a
replay
of
the
reserve
life
case.
the
same
arguments
that
were
made
by
ohio
in
that
case
were
made
by
alabama
here.
we
think
it
gives
much
too
little
credit
to
all
of
the
justices
who
heard
all
of
these
seven
cases
for
alabama
to
suggest
that
the
purpose
to
encourage
the
location
of
companies
in
alabama
is
something
that
nobody
ever
thought
of
in
the
prior
seven
cases.
that's
the
most
obvious
purpose
in
the
world.
if
you
give
a
domestic
preference
to
a
local
company,
of
course
it's
going
to
encourage
the
location
of
companies
in
your
state.
and
as
far
as
the
remaining
purposes
that
alabama
relies
on,
the
17
purposes,
those
are
purposes
that
any
company,
foreign
or
domestic,
can
accomplish.
there's
no
inherent
characteristic
of
a
domestic
company
that
makes
it
better
suited
to
sell
policies
in
rural
areas,
or
to
sell
small
policies
rather
than
big
ones,
or
industrial
policies,
or
any
of
the
other
types
of
advantages
that
the
state
contends
those
companies
are
offering.
so
the
first
critical
point,
we
think,
it
the
resolution
of
this
case
is
recognition
by
this
court
that
these
seven
cases
are
right
on
point.
and
this
brings
me
to
the
second
major
consideration
which
we
think
should
guide
the
decision
here,
and
that
is
the
concerns
that
we
think
the
court
has
felt
in
reaching
its
conclusions
in
these
seven
cases.
the
first
concern
it
seems
to
us
is
that
we're
talking
here
about
unlimited
discrimination.
in
this
case
we're
talking
triple
and
quadruple
taxation
of
out-of-state
companies.
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
that
relationship
has
any
bearing
whatsoever
to
the
goals
that
alabama
is
seeking
to
achieve.
now,
we
recognize
that
mathematical
precision
is
not
required
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
don't
think
that
total
imprecision
is
the
goal,
either,
and
it
just
seems
to
us
that
these
numbers
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
goals
and
they're
possibly
unlimited.
i
think
another
factor
that
has
influenced
the
court
in
these
seven
cases
is
that
out-of-state
companies
have
no
representation
in
the
legislature
of
alabama
and
there
is
no
protection
for
them
whatsoever.
going
back
to
justice
jackson's
statement--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--i
would
suggest
obviously
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
given
the
pattern
of
discrimination
that
we
see,
with
33
states
having
these
laws,
those
lobbyists
may
have
not
been
effective.
we
find
the
same
type
of
policy
concept,
i
think,
in
the
diversity
jurisdiction,
where
state
of
incorporation
and
principal
place
of
business
are
concerns
that
bear
on
whether
diversity
jurisdiction
exists.
so
we
think
that,
while
they
may
have
lobbyists,
obviously
these
statutes
have
persisted
over
a
long
period
of
time,
much
to
the
detriment
of
out-of-state
companies.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
empirical
data
has
been
offered
by
the
appellees
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
point
is,
even
if
it's
so,
it
is
not
a
justification
for
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
another
consideration
that
we
think
is--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--we
think
we're
entitled
to
summary
judgment
in
this
case,
regardless
of
all
the
evidence
that
the
state
has
entered
through
its
experts.
we
think
that's
simply
an
impermissible
purpose.
that
purpose,
as
indicated
previously,
was
obviously
present
in
each
one
of
those
seven
cases.
you
couldn't
miss
it,
and
as
i
indicated
previously
it
gives
too
little
credit
to
all
of
the
justices
that
sat
in
those
cases
to
assume
that
they
didn't
see
that
that
purpose
was
there.
so
we
say,
even
if
the
evidence
is
there,
the
purpose
is
impermissible
and
the
court
ought
to
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
that
we're
entitled
to
a
summary
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
purpose,
justice
o'connor.
if
the
state
said
that
every
out-of-state
company
had
to
keep
a
percentage
of
its
reserves
on
alabama
risks
in
alabama,
we
couldn't
quarrel
with
that.
but
what
they're
saying
is
that--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
those
purposes
here...
the
state
is
trying
to
accomplish
those
purposes
through
taxation,
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
that
is
not
the
proper
way
to
accomplish
them.
in
the
metropolitan
casualty
case--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--but
the
purpose
has
to
relate
to
the
particular
means
by
which
the
state
is
seeking
to
accomplish
its
goals.
in
the
metropolitan
casualty
case,
which
involved
a
similar
issue,
justice
o'connor,
this
court
in
1935
said
that
it
was
permissible
for
a
domestic
company
to
provide
by
contract
for
a
slightly
shorter
statute
of
limitations
than
a
foreign
company...
security.
that
case
was
decided
in
1935.
that
was
just
one
year
after
this
court
had
decided
in
1934
in
the
concordia
fire
case
by
a
vote
to
eight
to
nothing
on
this
point
that
domestic
preference
taxation
was
invalid.
and
in
the
metropolitan
casualty
case,
i
think
that
the
quotation
from
that
case
most
clearly
explains
the
difference
between
the
two:
"the
ultimate
test
of
validity",
the
court
said,
"is
not
whether
foreign
corporations
differ
from
domestics,
but
whether
the
differences
between
them
are
pertinent
to
the
subject
with
respect
to
which
the
classification
is
made.
"
when
you're
talking
about
security
and
statute
of
limitations,
it
was
pertinent,
the
court
found.
when
you're
talking
about
taxation,
it
was
not
pertinent.
our
ultimate
point
here
is
we
do
not
seek
a
free
ride
in
alabama
or
any
other
state.
we
ask
only
for
a
chance
to
be
equal
and
to
be
taxed
equally
if
we
contribute
to
the
state's
goals.
if
we
provide
rural
policies,
if
we
sell
small
policies,
if
we
provide
jobs
in
the
state,
if
we
put
assets
in
the
state,
then
we
think
we
ought
to
be
taxed
the
same
way
as
domestic
companies
are
taxed.
in
1910
when
this
court
first
considered
this
issue
in
the
southern
railway
case,
it
concluded
that
domestic
preference
taxation
"does
violence
to
the
federal
constitution.
"
nothing
has
occurred
in
the
last
75
years
to
change
this.
we
urge,
therefore,
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
this
case
be
reversed.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
reserve
life
case
is
still
the
critical
case
here,
and
my
brother
lightfoot
has
misstated
the
holding
of
that
case.
he
said
the
holding
was
that
there
was
no
discrimination.
i
would
like
to
quote
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
ohio
of
hamilton
county
at
196
northeastern
reporter
second
at
page
118.
the
court
said:
"accordingly,
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
the
taxing
distinction
existing
between
domestic
and
foreign
insurance
companies
is
neither
an
unreasonable
classification
of
taxpayers
nor
can
it
be
said
to
discriminate
either
in
favor
of
or
against
the
two
types
of
insurance
companies.
"
in
other
words,
there
were
alternative
holdings
in
that
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
and
this
court
reversed.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
wheeling
steel
versus
glander.
mr.
lightfoot
conceded
during
his
argument
that
20
to
one
would
be
irrational.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
of
north
dakota,
which
is
included
on
page
38a
of
the
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement,
in
which
that
trial
court
held
unconstitutional
north
dakota's
domestic
preference
tax
statute.
there
are
some
samples
in
that
opinion
of
the
magnitude
of
the
discrimination.
on
page
42a,
under
the
north
dakota
domestic
preference
statute
a
2-1/2
percent
gross
premiums
tax
is
imposed
on
out-of-state
companies
and
an
income
tax
is
imposed
on
north
dakota
companies.
in
the
case
of
massachusetts
mutual
life
insurance
company,
on
page
42a,
the
discrimination
is
more
than
four
to
one.
in
the
case
of
prudential
property
&
casualty
insurance
company,
it's
infinite.
in
the
case
of
prudential
life
insurance
company,
it's
more
than
seven
to
one.
in
the
case
of
metropolitan,
it's
more
than
seven
to
one.
the
oklahoma
statute
is
very
instructive
also.
that
statute
imposes
a
four
percent
gross
premiums
tax
on
out-of-state
companies
and
a
four
percent
income
tax--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--well,
i
think
the
court
dealt
precisely
with
that
issue
in
the
western
&
southern
case,
justice
white.
it
said
that
the
mccarran
act
lifted
commerce
clause
restraints,
but
it
did
not
lift
equal
protection
restraints.
and
we
rely
solely
on--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--in
the
legislative
history
of
the
mccarran
act,
congress
specifically
stated...
and
this
was
quoted
in
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
western
&
southern...
that
all
other
constitutional
provisions
were
to
continue
unaffected--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--by
the--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--because,
as
we
indicated
before,
it
may
be--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--i
guess
the
reasons
are,
anything
goes
if
you
say
that.
there
is
no
protection
for
out-of-state
companies.
it's
limitless
discrimination
and
i
think
this
court
has
never
been
prepared
to
countenance
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
metropolitan
still
does
handle
industrial
insurance
and
it's
one
of
its
most
profitable
lines.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
still
do,
and
all
they
want
is
the
opportunity
to
do
that
in
alabama
on
an
equal
basis
with
alabama
companies.
