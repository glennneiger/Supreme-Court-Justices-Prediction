justice
white
--and
just
citing--
justice
white
well,
even
if
the
mccarran
act...
even
if
the
equal
protection
clause
would
make
the
mccarran
act
irrelevant
in
this
case,
it
would
just
do
it
for
taxation.
the
mccarran
act
would
still
have
a
terrific
bite
in
other
areas.
justice
white
your
basic
purpose,
though,
is
to
benefit
local
industry,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
so
you're
just
saying
that
the
discrimination
is
justified
because
we
want
to
discriminate.
justice
white
i
know,
but
all
you
have
to
do
is
move
into
the
state
and
become
a
resident
and
the
discrimination
ends.
justice
white
but
you
still
say,
we're
entitled
to
discriminate
in
favor
of
local
companies?
justice
white
mr.
lightfoot,
what
does
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
say?
justice
white
well,
it
can
only
do
so
by
giving
congressional
consent
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
it
can't
by
fiat
say
it
isn't
interstate
commerce,
can
it?
justice
white
so
that
congress
says
that
in
insurance
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
didn't
it?
isn't
that
what
it
said?
justice
white
and
do
you
suggest
that
that
kind
of
a
congressional
policy
ought
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
something
is
reasonable
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
white
and
you
think
maybe
the
court
has
just
made
a
mistake
in
reserve
life?
how
about...
what
was
the
case
that
that
case
cited?
it
cited
what?
justice
white
when
was
that,
'46?
justice
white
and
that
was
before
mccarran-ferguson?
justice
white
after.
justice
white
so
we
made...
so
the
court
you
say
really
stumbled
twice?
justice
white
oh,
no,
no.
i
think
you
have
to
be
awfully
blind
not
to
see
what
a
state
is
doing
when
it
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
residence.
justice
white
you
would
say
that
a
tax
law
that
says,
we
tax
all
non-resident
insurance
corporations
x
and
all
resident
corporations,
all
insurance
companies
incorporated
in
alabama,
by
half
x,
you
would
say
that's
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
white
how
would
you
decide
it?
justice
white
you
say
it
would
be
a
harder
case,
but
would
it
be
controlled
by
reserve
or
not?
justice
white
well,
would
it
control...
would
wheeling
cover
it?
justice
white
would
it
or
not?
justice
white
well,
what
do
you
mean,
it
works?
justice
white
what
do
you
mean
by
it
works?
justice
white
why
do
you
suppose
the
northeastern
states
are
against
it?
justice
white
--i
don't
have
one
in
my
office.
well,
it's
getting
close
to
the
election.
we
count
votes.
justice
white
i
wasn't
alone
in
allied
stores,
i
don't
think.
justice
white
i
wasn't
alone
in
allied.
justice
white
how
does
this
aid
them?
what
it
does
is
increase
the
costs
and
the
premiums
of
the
foreign
insurers?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
it
just
means
that
they
pay
less
taxes
than
the
foreign
insurer.
justice
white
well,
how
does
that
help
them?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but
the
foreign
insurers
are
still
going
to
meet
the
competition,
aren't
they?
they're
going
to
have
the
same,
have
to
charge
the...
they're
certainly
not
going
to
be
undercut
on
their
premiums.
justice
white
how
does
it
help
the
local
industry?
justice
white
well,
all
right,
so
the
foreign
insurers
meet
it.
justice
white
so
why
can
they
sell
any
more?
justice
white
well,
if
you
don't
know
the
answer
to
it
i
don't
know
why
it's
a
rational
purpose.
justice
white
if
they
just
meet
whatever
premiums
the
locals
establish,
i
don't
know
how
the
locals
are
benefited
at
all
by
the
tax
preference.
justice
white
so
it
really
isn't
the
domestic
industry
that's
being
protected?
justice
white
we're
switching
to
the
consumer
now.
justice
white
well,
the
only
time
you
talked
about
the
consumer
before
was
the
country
consumer.
justice
white
you've
got
a
new
argument
now.
justice
white
well,
that's
a
real
piano
you're
playing.
justice
white
and
what
happened?
justice
white
reversed,
citing?
justice
white
mr.
zinn,
it
may
be...
let's
assume
you're
right
about
reserve
life.
but
i
take
it
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
is
at
least
implicitly
saying
that,
whatever
reserve
might
be,
whatever
it
might
mean,
it
should
be
disregarded
in
this
case.
what
do
you
say
about
the
argument
that
the
mccarran
act
is
a
statement
of
congressional
purpose
that
a
state
may
disregard
the
commerce
clause
and
including
that
it
can
discriminate,
despite
the
commerce
clause
it
can
discriminate,
against
insurance
companies?
justice
white
well,
that's
true,
but
i'm
asking
you
why
you
wouldn't
take
into
consideration
the
congressional
policy
in
determining
whether
something
is
reasonable
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
white
nobody
says
that
the
equal
protection
clause
was
lifted
by
the
mccarran
act.
i'm
just
asking
you,
why
shouldn't
you
consider
that
congressional
policy
in
deciding
whether
there's
a
rational
purpose
in
this
case?
justice
white
it's
true,
the
court
has
decided
otherwise
in
the
past,
but
i'm
still
asking
you
that
question.
