we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
against
ward.
mr.
zinn,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
zinn.
you
may
continue,
mr.
zinn.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
mean,
mr.
zinn,
that
only
domestic
companies
have
lobbyists?
chief
justice
burger
you
said,
at
least
i
thought
i
heard
you
say,
that
obviously,
or
generally,
this
type
of
tax
would
encourage
companies
to
come
into
the
state.
if
that's
so,
there
must
be
some
empirical
data
on
the
subject.
chief
justice
burger
the
point
i
was
curious
about
is
that
you
seem
to
concede
that.
you
think
it's
not
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lightfoot.
chief
justice
burger
doesn't
that
offset
the
whole
burden?
chief
justice
burger
why
can't
they
make
it
without
that
special
protection?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting,
with
reference
to
the
industrial
insurance,
that
because
traditionally
that's
not
a
very
profitable
business
that
the
domestic
companies
are
willing
to
carry
that
burden,
but
the
foreign
companies
shy
away
from
it?
chief
justice
burger
does
metropolitan
no
longer
handle
industrial
insurance?
chief
justice
burger
surely
metropolitan
did
at
one
time,
if
it
doesn't
now,
sell
industrial
insurance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
three
minutes
remaining,
mr.
zinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted--
