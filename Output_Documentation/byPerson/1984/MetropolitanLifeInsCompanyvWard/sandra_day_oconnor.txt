justice
o'connor
mr.
zinn,
how
about
the
purpose
of
assuring
greater
security
in-state
for
alabama
residents
covered
by
insurance?
justice
o'connor
or
having
certain
assets
within
the
state?
justice
o'connor
and
certainly
that's
a
portion
of
the
effect
of
the
tax
scheme.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
does
seem
to
have
a
rational
basis
and
not
be
an
invalid
purpose.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
