justice
rehnquist
is
that
what
you
claim
is
violated
here,
mr.
hooper,
your
right
to
travel?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
asked
you,
what
constitutional
right
is
it
that
you
claim
was
violated?
justice
rehnquist
well
then
it
is
not
a
right
to
travel,
it
is
equal
protection?
justice
rehnquist
and
you
think
that
people
are
deterred
from
moving
to
new
mexico
by
the
fact
that
if
they
are
a
vietnam
veteran
that
they
won't
get
a
property
tax
waiver?
justice
rehnquist
i
was
asking
you
a
question.
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
shouldn't
make
any
difference.
justice
rehnquist
why
under
supposing
you
were
still
living
in
tuckasegee,
north
carolina,
and
simply
owned
real
property
in
bernalillo
county?
couldn't
you
then
make
the
argument
that
any
sort
of
residency
requirement
was
violative
of
your
equal
rights?
justice
rehnquist
well,
why,
under
you
line
of
argument,
may
the
state
require
domicile?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
in
1983
the
new
mexico
legislature
had
enacted
a
statute
saying
that
all
vietnam
veterans
who
resided
in
new
mexico
at
the
time
of
their
entering
the
service
shall
now
get
a
$2,000
exemption?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
retrospective
as
you
put
it
is
bad,
certainly
that
is
retrospective.
i
mean,
the
statute
looks
back
to
another
time.
