justice
white
i
take
it
the
law
doesn't
require
that
the
person
be
a
resident
of
new
mexico
at
some
point
during
his
service.
justice
white
of
course,
new
mexico,
even
if
you
won,
new
mexico
could
satisfy
you
by
just
not
giving
the
break
to
anybody.
justice
white
may
i
ask
before
you
go
on,
mr.
hooper,
would
your
point
be
exactly
the
same
if
instead
of
a
tax
exemption
they
had
given
a
cash
bonus?
justice
white
what
about
those
people
in
that
extended
period,
that
year's
grace
period?
i
know
you
call
it
a
grace
period,
but
it
is
still
after
the
war
is
over
even
by
congressional
terms.
justice
white
what
if
they
had
said
we
are
going
to
give
five
years'
grace
period?
justice
white
you
are
saying
these
people
who
get
the
exemption
have
a
substantial
connection
residence
in
new
mexico
during
a
period
that
the
vietnam
war
had
some
substantial
impact
on
people
generally?
justice
white
why
should
the
exemption
go
on
forever?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
you
were
going
to
say
that
the
readjustment
period
lasts
for
a
length
of
time
but
not
forever.
you
would
think
that
when
the
readjustment
period
is
over
so
would
the
tax
exemption
disappear.
justice
white
i
know,
but
if
you
are
not
basing
it
on
a
necessity
for
readjustment,
it
seems
to
me
to
give
a
life-long
exemption
rather
exceeds
the
speed
limit.
justice
white
which
it
refuses
to
other
people.
justice
white
which
is
refuses
to
other
people.
justice
white
you
want
them
to
be
generous
to
you?
justice
white
well,
you
are
saying,
i
suppose,
that
if
new
mexico
is
giving...
in
1985
giving
a
tax
exemption
for
war
service
prior
to
1975--
justice
white
--1976
and
it
is
going
to
go
on
forever,
other
people
who
have
war
service
and
move
to
new
mexico
ought
to
get
the
same
break.
justice
white
if
it
had
been
in
a
lump
sum
you
wouldn't
be
arguing
that.
justice
white
well,
it
not
only
wouldn't
be
the
same,
but--
justice
white
--yes.
