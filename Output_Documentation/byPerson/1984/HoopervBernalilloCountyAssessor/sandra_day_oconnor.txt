mr.
hooper,
in
your
view,
would
the
statute
be
valid
if
it
were
limited
in
granting
the
exemption
only
to
veterans
who
were
inducted
while
they
were
living
in
new
mexico
and
returned
or
discharged
to
new
mexico?
justice
o'connor
would
it
be
valid
though
in
your
view
if
it
were
so
limited?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
were
a
couple
of
cases,
weren't
there,
from
new
york
which
had
to
do
with
a
statute
much
like
that
and
i
guess
this
court
affirmed
at
least
one
of
those
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
you
think
that
was
wrong
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it
is
not
a
legitimate
purpose
for
a
state
to
be
concerned
about
the
dislocation
that
the
draft
into
military
service
imposes
on
those
drafted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
from
within
their
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yes,
except
you
were
telling
me
that
you
think
even
one
drafted
differently
may
also
be
invalid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hooper,
may
i
inquire
also,
how
much
in
terms
of
dollars
in
bernalillo
county
in
1983
would
the
$2,000
property
exemption
have
been
worth?
what
are
we
talking
about
in
dollars?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
be
legitimate
in
your
view
to
limit
the
tax
exemption
to
residents
of
new
mexico
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
you
are
right
on
your
right-to-travel
argument,
it
would
defeat
that
kind
of
a
statute
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
one
of
your
arguments
i
thought
was
to
require
a
different
level
of
scrutiny
because
this
statute
violates
the
right
to
travel.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
if
it
were
limited
just
to
residents
of
any
duration
you
would
have
the
same
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
farr,
what
is
precisely
the
purpose
of
this
tax
exemption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
that
is
the
purpose,
this
is
kind
of
a
peculiar
date
to
impose,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
it
picks
up
people
who
were
not
residents
either
at
the
time
they
were
drafted
or
when
they
were
discharged.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
doesn't
if
they
don't
come
back
to
new
mexico
and
they
aren't
there
today.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
have
to
come
back
and
be
there
today.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
i
guess
the
war
ended
in
what
date,
the
vietnam
war?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
it
is
'76.
justice
o'connor
of
course,
this
case
is
a
little
different
because
the
new
mexico
statute
doesn't
really
require
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
does
of
course
give
the
tax
exemption,
for
example,
to
someone
who
had
never
lived
in
new
mexico
until,
let's
say,
may
6,
1976,
and
who
moves
there
that
date
but
would
deny
it
to
somebody
who
came
there
may
9th.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
that
is
the
difficulty
when
you
look
at
zobel,
i
suppose.
