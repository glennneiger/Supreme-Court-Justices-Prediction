so,
under
your
view
if
they
gave
a
cash
bonus
limited
in
time
and
i
move
to
arizona
i
could
pick
up
the
bonus?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
but,
your
rationale
seems
to
me
would
apply
to
both.
justice
stevens
how
many
people
qualify
for
the
benefit,
do
you
know?
justice
stevens
by
the
date
requirement?
justice
stevens
cuts
off
about
half
of
them?
justice
stevens
mr.
farr,
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
statute,
but
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
that
he
had
to
enlist
from
new
mexico?
justice
stevens
but
does
he
even
have
to
come
back?
couldn't
you
presumably--
justice
stevens
--why
does
he
have
to
be
a
resident
now?
justice
stevens
oh,
is
it?
i
didn't
realize
that.
justice
stevens
mr.
farr,
if
your
opponent
is
right,
and
i
don't
say
whether
he
is
or
not,
all
that
means
is...
he
says
they
are
all
unconstitutional
and
the
fact
that
they
follow
an
unconstitutional
pattern
after
every
war
doesn't
add
any
force
to
this
one.
justice
stevens
mr.
hooper,
you
rely
heavily
on
the
one-year
grace
period
you
might
call
it.
do
you
agree
the
statute
would
be
all
right
if
there
were
not
the
one-year
period?
justice
stevens
even
then,
of
course,
you
would
have
the
coincidence
of
residence
and
military
service.
justice
stevens
what
if
they
were
to
adopt
a
theory
that
they
require
a
person
to
have
been
a
resident
or
to
have
made
up
his
mind
to
become
a
resident
when
he
was
in
the
service?
justice
stevens
if
they
could
do
that,
couldn't
they
adopt
a
short-hand
proxy
and
we
will
presume
that
everybody
who
got
here
within
the
period
it
takes
to
get
demobilized
and
transported
back
from
the
far
east
and
all
the
rest
presumably
made
up
his
mind
to
come
here
while
he
was
in
vietnam?
justice
stevens
of
course,
the
vietnam
war
is
a
little
different,
but
you
said
this
case
is
really
like
all
the
others.
in
wars
service
really
doesn't
end
until
the
hostilities
end.
so,
normally
there
isn't
that
gap
between
possibly
being
discharged
a
couple
of
years
before
the
end
of
hostilities.
but,
you
rely
on
the
unique
circumstances
of
the
vietnam
war
then?
justice
stevens
they
all
had
a
period
of
grace
after
them,
didn't
they,
each
of
those?
