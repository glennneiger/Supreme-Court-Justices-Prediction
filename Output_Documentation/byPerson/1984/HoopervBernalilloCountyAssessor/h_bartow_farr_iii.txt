mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
new
mexico,
in
awarding
a
modest
benefit
for
service
during
the
vietnam
war,
may
impose
a
condition
of
bona
fide
residency
at
the
time
of
the
war.
in
our
view,
it
clearly
may.
now,
it
is
important
to
understand
just
how
the
statute
works.
in
giving
a
benefit
for
service
during
the
vietnam
war,
new
mexico
has
created
two
classes
based
upon
residency
at
that
time.
the
first
class
and
one
that
admittedly
is
not
mathematically
exact,
consists
mainly
of
persons
leaving
new
mexico
for
the
war
and
persons
coming
back
and
settling
in
new
mexico
within
a
year
after
the
war's
end.
that
class
new
mexico
regards
as
its
citizens
at
the
time
of
the
war
and
they
get
a
modest
reduction
in
their
property
valuation.
the
second
class
consists
of
people
who
left
from
other
states,
came
back
and
settled
in
other
states,
and
had
no
ties
whatsoever
to
new
mexico
at
any
time
during
the
vietnam
war.
that
group
may
have
gotten
bonuses
and
other
benefits
from
their
home
states
at
the
time
of
the
war
but
they
do
not
qualify
for
the
new
mexico
benefit.
now,
appellant's
argument
depends
essentially
on
compressing
two
separate
time
periods
into
one.
looked
at
closely,
his
claim
to
the
new
mexico
benefit
says,
first,
that
20
or
so
years
ago
he
served
during
the
vietnam
war.
then
he
says
four
years
ago
he
came
to
new
mexico
and
became
a
resident
and
is
now
a
resident
of
new
mexico.
thus,
he
says,
he
is
both
a
soldier
and
a
resident
indistinguishable
from
other
soldiers
and
residents
who
get
the
benefit.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
tax
exemption,
i
think,
has
several
purposes.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
state
legitimately
wants
to
reward
the
people
from
that
state
who
went
into
the
service
and
i
think
that
is
the
purpose.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
one
of
the
purposes.
i
think
there
are
several
groups
that
fall
within
the
class.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
class
that
it
does
pick
up
the
people
who
were
residents
at
the
time
they
went
in.
they
certainly
fit
within
the
class.
it
also
picks
up
people
who
came
back--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
is
right.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
official
date
that
congress
has
given
for
the
end
of
the
vietnam
era
is
may
7,
1975
which
is
the
date
put
in
this
statute
in
1981
and
then
there
was
an
additional
year's
grace
period
provided.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct.
so,
it
does
pick
up,
however,
assuming
they
are
residents
now,
the
people
who
left
from
vietnam
and
went
to
the
war.
it
also
picks
up
anyone
who
came
back
and
settled
in
new
mexico
during
the
period
of
the
war
which
is
the
time
presumably
that
new
mexico
can
recognize
as
one
of
significant
adjustment
back
to
civilian
life.
there
may
not
be
an
exact
time
period
between
the
two,
but
i
think
again
generally
it
serves
that.
the
person
that
appellant
keeps
relying
on
who
is
within
the
class
but
admittedly
doesn't
exactly
fit
these
purposes
is
someone
who
had
to
have
been
in
new
mexico
long
ago.
he
then
had
to
have
left
before
the
war
started,
otherwise,
of
course,
he
is
within
the
class
we
are
trying
to
benefit,
then
he
has
to
not
come
back
to
new
mexico
or
otherwise
again
he
would
be
within
the
class.
but
then
he
does
have
to
come
back
later
and
claim
the
benefit.
i
don't
think
new
mexico
has
to
draft
a
statute
that
knocks
him
out
in
order
to
uphold
the
rest.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
no,
no,
i
am
sorry.
what
i
am
saying
is
people
who
do
enlist
from
new
mexico
are
within
the
class
benefit.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
person
that
appellant
is
talking
about
who
doesn't
really
fit
within
this
purpose
at
all
but
who
gets
the
benefit,
in
fact,
has
to
do
the
opposite.
he
has
to
have
lived
in
new
mexico
before
the
war,
then
not
enlisted
from
new
mexico,
not
come
back
to
new
mexico
after
the
war,
but
then
later
come
back
afterwards.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
has
to
be
a
resident
now,
yes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
a
separate
requirement
of
the
statute.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
yes,
it
is.
on
the
subject
of
rewarding
residents
but
not
non-residents
at
the
time
of
the
war,
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
or
even
unusual
about
it,
although
this
obviously
is
not
dispositive.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no.
in
fact,
new
mexico
is
unusually
generous
in
that
it
is
not
a
state
that
would
deprive
a
veteran
who
had
moved,
for
example,
before
may
7,
1976,
of
the
exemption
simply
because
he
received
a
bonus
somewhere
else.
other
states
that
have
similar
arrangements
do
have
a
specific
limitation
that
says
essentially
one
bite
at
the
apple.
if
you
got
one
somewhere
else,
then
you
can't
come
here
and
claim
another
one.
new
mexico
does
not
do
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
believe
they
probably
could
constitutionally
do
that,
but,
as
i
say,
they
don't.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
the
fact
is
though
that...
i
think
again
it
depends.
if
they
satisfy
the
conditions
of
this
statute...
in
other
words,
if
they
are
within
the
group
that
new
mexico
rightfully
considers
its
citizens
at
the
time
of
the
war,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
they
should
be
able
to
get
the
benefit
and
new
mexico
wants
them
to
have
the
benefit
whether
or
not
they
have
gotten
the
benefit
from
some
place
else.
i
think
they
could
perhaps
cut
that
class
more
narrowly.
but,
i
think
it
is
to
their
credit
they
haven't.
i
don't
think
it
makes
the
statute
more
constitutionally
suspect.
now,
in
connection
with
pure
residency
requirements
at
the
time
of
service
as
opposed
to
durational
residency
requirements,
every
court
that
has
ever
considered
that
has
upheld
it.
in
fact,
one
court
recently,
the
supreme
court
of
maine,
upheld
a
requirement
at
the
time
of
service...
in
that
case
the
statute
was
you
had
to
be
a
resident
at
the
time
you
went
into
the
service...
at
the
same
time
it
struck
down
a
durational
residency
requirement.
and,
as
justice
o'connor
noted
earlier,
the
federal
district
court
in
august
versus
bronstein
upheld
the
new
york
employment
preference
to
veterans
who
were
new
york
residents
when
they
entered
the
service
and
this
court
summarily
affirmed
that
decision.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
seems
to
me
that
the
new
mexico
statute
is,
in
fact,
more
generous
than
the
new
york
statute
at
issue
in
august
versus
bronstein
and,
indeed,
more
generous
than
almost
any
other
statute,
in
fact,
perhaps
any
other
statute
that
does
give
bonuses
or
other
benefits.
new
mexico
originally
had
a
statute
which...
for
the
vietnam
war
which
conditioned
the
benefit
on
entry
into
the
service
from
new
mexico.
what
they
did
in
1981
and
then
again
in...
by
adding
a
year
in
1983
was
to
expand
that
class
of
beneficiaries
so
they
didn't
cut
out
people
who
came
back
and
settled
during
the
time
of
the
war.
i
think
that
makes
the
statute
better
rather
than
worse
from
a
constitutional
standpoint.
appellant
makes
two
attacks
on
the
means
used
by
new
mexico
to
serve
its
purpose.
first
he
says
that
the
date
of
may
7,
1976,
described
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
one
year
after
the
final
u.s.
troop
withdrawal,
is,
in
fact...
i
think
that
is
phrased
correctly...
pulled
out
of
thin
air
and
bears
no
relation
to
the
vietnam
war
at
all.
this
argument
is
simply
incorrect.
in
title
38,
section
101
of
the
u.s.
code,
congress
has
specifically
provided
in
defining
those
eligible
for
federal
veterans'
benefits
that
the
vietnam
era
ended
on
may
7,
1975.
that
date
is
precisely
the
date
that
new
mexico
chose
in
1981
when
it
first
enlarged
the
statute
before
it
added
on
another
year's
grace
period
in
1983.
now,
appellant's
other
argument
is
even
if
new
mexico
could
have
declared
a
benefit
for
all
its
resident
veterans
on
may
7,
1976
it
could
not
grant
a
retroactive
benefit
to
exactly
the
same
class
in
1981
or
1983.
now,
in
my
view,
this
is
really
appellant's
main
argument
just
stated
another
way.
if
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
awarding
new
mexico
soldiers
a
benefit
on
may
7,
1976
because
they
had
particular
ties
to
new
mexico
at
the
time
of
the
war,
which
is
what
we
submit,
that
basis
does
not
disappear
simply
because
the
war
is
over.
for
example,
if
new
mexico
had
granted
a
benefit
to
its
veterans
on
may
7,
1976
on
the
basis
of
those
special
ties,
appellant
clearly
would
not
have
been
able
to
claim
the
same
benefit
simply
by
showing
up
five
years
later.
yet,
the
basis
of
the
benefit
and
appellant's
lack
of
the
necessary
ties
is
exactly
the
same
in
1981
and,
in
fact,
it
is
exactly
the
same
right
now.
this
case
thus
is
very,
very--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i
think
again
the
fact
that
they
give
the
extra
year
in
my
view
doesn't
make
the
thing
any...
constitutionally
more
infirm.
but,
particularly
if
you
look
at--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--in
one
sense
i
think
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
determine
how
long
they
think
a
reasonable
readjustment
period
after
a
war
would
be.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
precisely
the
date
congress
picks
at
the
end
of
the
war
and
i
think
a
year
is
all
right.
i
think
five
years
might
get
out
toward
the
edge,
but
the
fact
is,
particularly
if
you
look
at
the
conditions
in
vietnam--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
is
correct.
and,
i
think
unfortunately,
of
course,
people
coming
back
from
the
vietnam
war,
unlike
people
coming
back
from
other
previous
wars,
the
readjustment
period
i
think
is
generally
seen
to
be
much
longer.
i
think
for
a
state
to
say
we
still
think
there
may
be
people
coming
back
by
may
7,
1976,
a
year
after
the
end
of
the
era,
who
we
feel
a
special
solicitude
for,
i
think
that
is
entirely
proper.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
if
the
retroactive
part--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--in
terms
of
the
tax
exemption?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
that
is
simply
a
matter
of
how
new
mexico
chooses
to--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i
certainly
don't
think
new
mexico
would
be
prohibited
from
ending
the
tax
exemption
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
requirement
that
they
have
to
continue.
if
it
fits
its
purposes
initially,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
state
can
say
rather
than
to
have
a
period
of
time
where
we
say,
okay,
you
don't
need
any
more
help,
we
are
still
thankful
for
what
you
did.
we
feel
that
the
help
we
gave
you
was
useful
and
we
will
continue
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
it
is
essentially
just
a
matter
of
state
generosity.
i
mean,
again
i
think
that
a
state
doesn't
have
to
say--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--pardon
me?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
because
they
are
not
within
the
class
of
people
that
new
mexico
feels
had
the
special
ties
at
the
time
of
what
you
are
getting
the
benefit
for.
that
is
simply
a
matter
of
classification.
exactly
how
you
pay
out
the
benefit,
what
the
particular
dollar
amount
is,
whether
you
pay
it
in
a
lump
sum
or
pay
it
out
over
time,
seems
to
me
essentially
doesn't
change
the
constitutional
picture
if
the
class
that
is
getting
it
is
properly
deserving.
i
think
they
are.
i
would
like
to
point
out
too,
as
justice
o'connor
was
talking
about
earlier,
they
did...
new
mexico
had
a
statute
in
1976.
we
are
talking
about
the
retroactivity
problem.
what
they
did
in
1981
was
simply
try
to
expand
this,
not
just
generally
but
to
give
to
vietnam
veterans
the
same
sort
of
benefit
that
they
had
given
to
the
veterans
of
every
other
war.
up
until
1981
the
vietnam
veterans
in
new
mexico
stood
on
a
lesser
footing
than
world
war
i
veterans,
world
war
ii
veterans
and
korean
war
veterans.
so
that
there
effort
in
1981
was,
in
fact,
to
give
the
same
sort
of
classification
to
vietnam
veterans
that
they
had
given
for
other
wars.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
understand
that.
but
at
least
in
terms
of
the
retroactivity
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
if,
in
fact,
a
state
is
prohibited
by
the
constitution
from
going
back
and
adjusting
a
statute
after
the
event
for
which...
at
which
the
statute
is
being
directed,
then
it
would
prevent
them
from...
let's
say,
for
example,
in
an
earlier
situation
they
had
a
perfectly
legitimate
statute
and
they
simply
wanted
to
conform
this
to
that
without
any
question
about
it.
presumably
appellant's
argument
would
prevent
them
from
doing
that
too
and
that
is
simply
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
my
view
this
case
is
completely
different
in
both
time
and
degree
from
zobel
versus
williams.
new
mexico
has
not
decided
that
long-term
residents
simply
by
virtue
of
their
residence
are
somehow
more
deserving
than
other
residents.
residence
itself
doesn't
give
anybody
a
right
to
this
benefit
and
many,
if
not
most,
long-time
residents
of
new
mexico
don't
get
it.
nor
is
new
mexico
trying
to
reward
citizens
after
the
fact
simply
for
having
done
what
is
normally
expected
of
citizens
as
state
citizens.
what
new
mexico
has
done
is
to
recognize
that
some
people
while
as
residents
did
something
extra
and
deserve
an
extra
measure
of
thanks
and
help.
that
judgment
simply
doesn't
create
the
sort
of
second
class
citizenship
that
was
at
issue
in
zobel.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct.
but,
i
don't
think...
if
that
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i
don't
regard
it
as
the
same
though
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
that
is
true
of
any
statute
that
draws
a
line.
you
look
at
someone
just
on
one
side
and
someone
just
on
the
other
and
you
say
that,
boy,
they
look
a
lot
alike.
so,
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
unique
about
this
statute.
in
the
zobel
situation
though
the
purpose
was
simply
to
reward
citizens
generally
for
the
generalized
notion
that
they
had
been
citizens
through
a
period
of
time
doing
what
is
normally
expected
of
citizens,
nothing
unusual.
i
think
the
court
correctly
said
in
zobel
that
purpose
is
impermissible,
it
opens
up
an
endless
amount
of
doors
that
could
lead
to
real
second-class
citizenship.
but
here
i
think
they
are
just
simply
saying
this
is
the
line
we
are
drawing
for
the
end
of
a
particular
event
that
we
are
rewarding
by
giving
special
help
for
and
i
think
it
is
a
completely
different
kind
of
line.
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
just
a
few
minutes
on
the
question
of
right
to
travel.
appellant
has
said
that
even
if
the
statute
if
perfectly
rational,
it
still
must
be
struck
down
because
it
burdens
the
right
to
travel.
i
think
the
argument
is
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
this
case
really
doesn't
involve
the
right
to
travel
in
the
usual
sense.
as
i
have
said,
what
this
case
is
really
about
is
a
bona
fide
residency
requirement
at
the
time
of
the
war.
in
cases
involving
the
question
of
residency
at
the
time
of
a
particular
event
as
opposed
to
over
a
length
of
time,
i
think
the
proper
focus
should
be
on
barriers
to
residency
at
the
time
of
the
event.
new
mexico
did
not
put
up
any
barriers
to
appellant
coming
to
new
mexico
during
the
time
of
the
war.
this
is
not
a
situation,
for
example,
where
appellant
is
saying
i
was
there
on
may
1,
1976,
but
there
was
a
requirement
that
i
had
to
have
been
there
six
months
before
may
6,
1976
and,
therefore,
i
haven't
gotten
the
bonus.
what
he
is
simply
saying
is
i
came
later
and,
therefore,
didn't
get
into
the
class.
i
think
that
is
a
very
different
kind
of
inquiry
from
the
right-to-travel
inquiry
than
the
court
is
normally
engaged
in.
but,
even
if
you
look
at
the
situation
in
1981
when
appellant
came
or
if
you
look
at
it
now,
i
still
think
that
there
isn't
any
real
burden
on
the
right
to
travel.
this
is
not
a
case,
for
example,
where
the
state
has
deliberately
sought
to
keep
out
any
particular
residents
or
new
residents
generally,
therefore,
for
example,
it
is
completely
different
from
shapiro
where
there
was
an
impermissible
purpose
very
obvious
from
the
statute
to
keep
indigents
out
of
the
state.
nor
does
it
present
any
concern
about
a
state
trying
to
wall
itself
off
from
national
concerns.
to
the
contrary
actually,
new
mexico
is
rewarding
a
national
service
in
this
situation.
there
is
also
no
intolerable
penalty.
again,
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
state
is
depriving
new
residents
of
welfare
benefits
or
medical
care
or
something
of
that
nature.
even
if
those...
even
if
denial
of
those
benefits
is
intended
to
keep
people
from
traveling,
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
that
it
will
make
people
realistically
think
twice,
some
class
of
people,
and
if
they
come
anyway
may
cause
a
serious
hardship.
but,
we
are
talking
essentially
here
about
a
tax
exemption
of
$100
or
so
to
someone
who
has
to
be
a
property
owner
in
the
first
place
and
i
don't
think
it
in
any
way
amounts
to
that
sort
of
penalty.
so,
our
position
in
short
is
that
the
statute
does
not
infringe
the
right
to
travel.
new
mexico
has
made
a
rational
decision
to
confer
a
special
benefit
on
those
veterans
who
were
its
residents
at
the
time
of
the
war
and
it
has
defined
that
class
not
in
a
mathematically
precise
manner
but
in
a
perfectly
rational
manner
and
equal
protection
requires
nothing
more.
thank
you.
