mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
appellant
alvin
hooper
has
been
permanently
denied
a
veterans
property
tax
exemption
which
is
given
to
other
similarly
situated
veterans
in
new
mexico
solely
because
he
did
not
establish
residence
in
that
state
prior
to
may
8,
1976.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
that
denial
by
the
appellee
assessor
denies
his
constitutional
rights
of
state
citizenship,
equal
protection,
and
his
fundamental
right
of
interstate
migration.
the
court
of
appeals
from
new
mexico
held
that
the
denial
by
the
assessor
did
not
violate
those
rights
and
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
refused
to
review
that
decision
and
the
case
is
now
before
this
court
on
appeal.
the
facts
of
the
case
can
be
briefly
stated.
new
mexico
constitution
authorizes
a
veteran's
property
tax
exemption
in
the
amount
of
$2,000
and
that
exemption
is
implemented
through
new
mexico
statute
737-5,
which
is
the
statute
involved
in
this
case.
in
order
to
quality
for
the
exemption,
the
statute
requires
that
the
claimant
actually
be
a
veteran.
secondly,
that
the
veteran
be
a
bona
fide
resident
at
the
time
of
claiming
the
exemption,
and,
thirdly,
that
the
veteran
had
served
on
active
duty
for
90
days
during
a
period
of
armed
conflict.
there
is
no
question
about
appellant
hooper
meeting
those
qualifications
and
those
are
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
however,
this
statute
goes
on
to
add
another
durational
type
residential
requirement
which
requires
that
a
vietnam-era
veteran
claiming
the
exemption
must
have
been
a
resident
of
the
state
prior
to
may
8,
1976
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
exemption.
and,
it
is
the
validity
of
this
additional
residency
requirement
that
is
in
issue
in
this
case.
the
appellants
believe
this
case
is
controlled
by
zobel
v.
williams
and
under
that
case
the
residency
requirement
is
invalid.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
no,
your
honor,
and
that
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
i
contend
this
statute
has
no
the
residency
requirement
has
not
rational
basis.
there
is
no
coincidence
of
military
service
and
residence
required.
like
zobel,
this
case
involves
permanent
and
retrospective
classifications
of
residents
in
which
the
newer
arriving
residents
are
never
able
to
achieve
equality
with
the
earlier
arriving
residents.
now,
only
two
alleged
purposes
have
been
set
forth
by
the
state
and
by
the
assessor
which
were
accepted
by
the
court
below
as
purposes
for
this
statute.
one
of
those
purposes
is
to
express
gratitude
and
to
reward
new
mexico's
veterans
and
to
ease
their
return
to
civilian
life
at
the
end
of
their
military
service.
however,
this
statute
has
a
problem
in
that
regard.
if
new
mexico's
intent
was
to
reward
veterans
who
were
residents
at
the
time
the
exemption
was
given,
then
they
have
failed
to
do
that.
the
statute
is
under-inclusive
because
it
did
not
include
bona
fide
resident
veterans
such
as
appellant
and
all
other
residents
who
had
moved
to
the
state
since
may
8,
1976.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
that
is
certainly
a
very
substantial
factor
which
is
not
present
in
this
case.
however--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--i
do
not
believe
it
would
be
for
this
reason.
service
in
the
military
is
really
in
the
national
interest
and
a
veteran
has
served
new
mexico
whether
or
not
he
entered
the
service
from
new
mexico.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
this
court
summarily
affirmed
one
of
those--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--i
believe
that
distinction
is
wrong
because
really
all
that
boils
down
to
is
the
fact
that
the
veteran
is
being
rewarded
for
prior
residency,
not
for
prior
service,
because
i
served
new
mexico
equally
even
though
i
was
not
a
resident
at
the
time
of
the
military
service.
a
person
that
enters
service
does
that
because
of
a
national
interest
and
serves
any
state
equally
and
i--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--i
think
it
is.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
i
think
it
most
certainly
is
for
those
resident
at
the
time.
but,
once
again,
i
say
this
statute
does
not
require
that
kind
of
coincidence,
so
that
issue--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--that
is
right.
and,
the
question
presented
by
the
assessor
in
their
brief,
in
fact,
relies
on
that
and
indicates
the
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
this
statute
because
it
is
based
entirely
on
a
coincidence
of
military
service
and
residency
which
is
not
required
by
this
statute.
the
other--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--yes,
your
honor,
i
have
been
a
resident
since
august
of
'81.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
i
have
moved
around
so
much
i
am
admitted
in
a
number
of
states
and
north
carolina
just
happens
to
be
my
home
state
and
that
was
the
reason
i
requested
admission
from
north
carolina.
i
am
still
a
member
of
the
north
carolina
bar
as
well.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
admission
only
requires
that
you
be
a
member
of
any
highest
the
court
of
any--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--it
only
requires
you
to
be
admitted
to
a
bar.
you
don't
have
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--well,
that
is
not
based
on
legal
residency
though.
i
interpret
that
requirement
as
only
being
where
i
want
the
certificate
to
show
i
was
admitted
is
the
way
i
believe
that
is
interpreted.
the
second--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--it
would
be
somewhere
between
$100
and
$200
annually
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
but
i
believe
this
involves
a
fundamental
principle
and
dollar
value
cannot
be
attached
to
it.
however,
i
would
remind
the
court
that
in
the
zobel
case
the
dividend
involved
there
was
a
very
nominal
dollar
amount
but
yet
five
concurring
justices
in
that
case
indicated
that
that
scheme,
even
though
it
involved
a
nominal
amount
of
money,
clearly
impacted
the
right
to
travel
even
though
that
issue
did
not
have
to
be
addressed
in
that
case.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
i
believe
this
classification
will
not
pass
the
rational
basis
test,
however--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--my
constitutional
right
to
be
treated
equally
with
other
citizen
residents
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
it
is
both,
your
honor.
it
is
equal
protection
and
also
a
right
to
travel.
i
consider
those
now
the
right
to
travel
has
been
analyzed
in
equal
protection
terms
but
both
aspects
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
this
court
has
specifically
ruled
that
deterrence
is
not
required,
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
no,
i
don't
believe
people
are
necessarily
deterred,
but
i
don't
believe
whether
they
consider
the
exemption
as
part
of
their
decision
to
move
to
new
mexico,
i
don't
believe
that
is--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--i
don't
believe
it
should,
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
in
fact,
there
is
an
exemption
for
each
one
of
them
has
their
own
specified
residency.
for
the
first
world
war
veterans
it
is
some
date
in
1934;
for
the
second
world
war
it
is
january
of
'47,
i
believe;
and
for
the
korean
war
it
is
february
of
'55.
but,
nevertheless,
i
believe
that
all
of
those
classifications
are
suspect
under
the
same--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--no,
your
honor,
these
have
never
been
challenged
in
the
state
court.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
well,
that
certainly
is
one
possibility,
your
honor,
but
i
am
hoping
that
the
residency
requirement
will
simply
be
severed
from
the
remainder
of
the
statute
and
the
exemption
given
to
everyone.
but,
certainly
that
is
my
concern,
that
this
statute
differentiates
improperly
between
those
who
were
residents
before
an
arbitrary
date
and
those
who
became
residents
after
that
date.
the
second
thing
that--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--it
is
essentially
the
same
thing,
your
honor.
in
fact--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--well,
now
the
bonus
there
is
one
difference.
the
bonus
is
a
one-shot
kind
of
deal.
this
has
a
year
after
year
implication.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
well,
if
it
is
a
one-shot
deal
for
a
bonus
in
other
words,
if
in
1983
they
had
said
we
are
going
to
give
a
bonus
to
people
who
are
resident
at
this
time
for
1983,
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
but,
this
was
retrospective.
it
was
enacted
in
1983
but
went
back
to
'76
and
then
it
is
a
continuing
lifetime
benefit
and
that
is
where
the
problem
is.
it
has
both
a
long-term,
year
after
year
impact
and
it
also
has
a
retrospective
feature.
when
it
was
enacted
in
1983,
it
was
differentiating
between
those
veterans
who
were
residents
of
the
state
at
that
time.
if
it
had
been
enacted
prospectively
only
or
enacted
in
1983
only
for
1983,
i
would
assume
all
who
were
residents
at
that
time
would
have
gotten
it.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
that
is
not
in
the
record,
but
it
my
understanding
that
there
are
about
130,000
potentially
qualified
veterans
in
the
state
and
only
less
than
half
of
those
actually
qualify
for
the
bonus
because
of
these
various
requirements
placed
on
them.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
yes,
sir.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
yes,
your
honor.
the
second
alleged
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
encourage
veterans
to
settle
in
new
mexico.
well,
i
believe
the
assessor
himself
has
even
abandoned
that
argument
before
this
court,
because,
as
was
pointed
out
in
appellants'
brief,
that
purpose
is
an
impossibility.
it
is
impossible
to
enact
a
reward
in
1983
to
encourage
veterans
to
settle
in
new
mexico
before
1976.
it
is
impossible
to
encourage
to
do
something
seven
years
after
a
date
that
is
already
passed.
we
believe
that
the
requirement
of
residency
is
not
rationally
related
to
these
alleged
purposes
of
the
statute
and
there
are
really
four
basic
factors
which
go
into
that
position.
the
first
factor
is,
as
we
have
briefly
pointed
out,
there
is
no
nexus
between
the
veteran
and
new
mexico
based
on
a
coincidence
of
military
service
and
residency.
the
prior
residency
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
military
service.
so,
it
really
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
new
mexico
is
essentially
simply
rewarding
its
veterans
for
prior
residency
only
and
i
do
not
believe
under
the
holdings
of
this
court
that
that
is
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
the
second
factor--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--oh,
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
believe
it
is
legitimate
to
limit
it
that
way.
and,
in
fact,
the
implication
in
the
assessor's
brief
seem
to
be
that
i
was
challenging
residency
requirements
per
se
and
also
challenging
classifications
of
veterans
as
opposed
to
non-veterans
per
se.
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
it
is
conceded
that
i
am
a
bona
fide
veteran
and
i
am
a
bona
fide
resident,
so
those
are
not
in
issue.
this
is
an
additional
requirement
over
and
above
that.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
i
think
the
term
"residency"
as
used
in
there,
which
is
not
in
issue
here,
is
synonymous
with
domicile.
you
have
to
physically
live
there
with
intent
to
remain
there.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
because
i
think
this
court
has
clearly
held
that
you
can
apportion
benefits
between
residents
and
non-residents
and
that
is
not
the
issue
here
at
all.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
comment.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
well,
my
argument
is
that
it
will
not
pass
a
rational
basis
test.
however,
if
this
court
should
determine
that
it
should
pass
that
test,
then
it
should
apply
the
strict
scrutiny
test
because
of
the
impact
on
the
right
to
travel.
i
don't
really
believe
you
need
to
get
to
the
strict
scrutiny
test
in
the
same
way
that
you
did
not
get
to
it
in
the
zobel
case.
that
case
was
decided
on
simply
a
rational
basis
ground
and
i
believe
that
is
adequate
in
this
case.
but,
as
five
concurring
justices
indicated
in
that
case,
if
it
had
been
necessary,
the
strict
scrutiny
would
have
been
applied
to
invalid
that
statute.
that
is
my
position
here.
we
have
absolutely
no
quarrel
with
a
residency
requirement
per
se.
the
second
factor
that
i
wanted
to
mention
was
the
retrospective
nature
of
this
requirement.
as
i
mentioned,
it
was
enacted
in
1983,
seven
years
after
the
date
had
passed.
this
is
very
analogous
to
the
retrospective
feature
in
the
zobel
statute
which
this
court
invalidated.
now,
the
assessor
has
contended
that
this
residency
requirement
is
somehow
tied
to
enable
veterans
to
make
the
transition
from
military
life
back
to
civilian
life.
well,
in
1983
when
it
was
enacted
they
had
already
had
eight
years
in
which
to
readjust
to
civilian
life
and
it
doesn't
make
sense
then
to
come
along
and
say,
well,
eight
years
after
the
fact
we
still
have
a
concern
about
your
readjustment
to
civilian
life,
therefore,
we
are
going
to
give
you
this
veteran's
exemption.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
that
is
essentially
the
same
question
that
justice
o'connor,
i
believe,
asked.
that
is
a
different
situation
here
and
certainly
residency
at
the
time
of
entering
service,
that
special
nexus
between
the
veteran
and
the
state
at
that
time
is
a
substantial
factor.
i
personally
don't
believe
it
is
adequate
it
is
still
adequate
to
be
valid,
but
it
is
certainly
a
very
substantial
factor
which
is
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
it
is
retrospective
in
a
sense.
as
i
say,
i
don't
believe
that
statute
itself
would
be
valid,
but
it
at
least
has
some
rationality
to
it
in
that
there
may
be
some
rational
basis
for
saying
a
state
has
more
interest
in
its
veterans
who
were
veterans
at
a
particular
time
during
their
military
service.
this
retrospective
feature
that
we
are
complaining
of,
a
veteran
did
not
even
have
to
be
a
resident
on
may
8,
1976
in
order
to
claim
this.
it
just
simply
picked
that
day
out
of
thin
air.
it
is
completely
arbitrary.
the
veteran
had
to
have
lived
in
new
mexico
one
day
as
an
infant
in
1920
and
moved
away
from
the
state
and
never
come
back
to
new
mexico
until
he
retired
at
age
65
in
1985
and
he
would
immediately
get
this
exemption.
that
is
how
that
statute
is
worded.
it
has
no
rational
basis
whatsoever.
so,
it
is
not
tied
to
any
this
may
8th
date
is
completely
pulled
out
of
thin
air.
it
has
no
connection
to
anything.
the
assessor
and
the
court
below
indicated
that
it
was
somehow
related
to
the
cessation
of
hostilities
in
vietnam.
in
fact,
they
specifically
mention
in
two
places
that
it
was
one
year
after
the
cessation
of
hostilities.
well,
it
clearly
is
not.
the
cessation
of
hostilities
and
the
peace
treaty
occurred
in
january
of
1973,
more
than
three
years
before
this
date
was
chosen
and
not
one
year
after
the
fact
as
was
indicated
by
the
assessor.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
that
is
certainly
much
more
legitimate
than
this
is.
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not,
because
i
was
not
a
resident
at
the
time.
and,
if
new
mexico
had
given
a
bonus
during
the
war
to
those
who
were
residents
at
that
time,
i
would
have
no
claim
to
that
and
that
is
not
what
i
am
claiming
at
all.
i
am
claiming
that
here
they
are
giving
an
on-going,
year-after-year
exemption
based
solely
on
an
arbitrary
date
of
residency
which
is
not
tied
to
anything.
i
believe
that
classifying
similarly
situated
veterans
into
permanent
classes
and
this
is
a
permanent
classification
people
who
came
after
1976
are
forever
barred
from
achieving
equality
with
those
who
came
before.
i
believe
that
that
kind
of
classification
creates
a
seniority
system
of
state
citizens
in
which
the
earlier
arriving
residents
are
more
worthy
or
more
equal
in
a
sense
than
those
who
arrived
later.
i
believe
this
court's
decisions
have
clearly
indicated
that
those
kinds
of
seniority
systems
based
on
duration
of
residency
or
length
of
residency
are
invalid.
and
by
the
same
rationale,
this
residency
requirement
is
invalid.
in
fact,
it
is
hard
to
separate
date
of
residency
from
length
of
residency.
they
are
exactly
the
same
thing
unless
there
has
been
some
discontinuity
in
the
residency
at
some
place
along
the
line.
this
is
essentially
the
same
as
in
1983
when
new
mexico
enacted
this
statute,
they
said
to
their
veterans,
in
order
to
get
this
benefit
you
must
have
lived
in
new
mexico
for
the
last
seven
years.
that
is
essentially
what
it
boils
down
to.
and,
that,
to
me,
is
clearly
not
permissible
in
view
of
this
court's
many
holdings
regarding
durational
residency
requirements.
i
believe
the
1982
zobel
v.
williams
case
really
controls
this
case.
the
court
below
really
dismissed
that
case
with
a
wave
of
a
hand
and
simply
said
that
for
two
reasons
that
that
involved
a
tax
legislation
this
involves
tax
legislation
where
zobel
did
not
and,
secondly,
that
for
some
reason
it
was
not
applicable
to
this
case
because
zobel
apportioned
a
benefit
rather
than
denying
the
entire
benefit.
to
me,
it
would
appear
much
worse
to
deny
the
benefit
entirely
than
it
would
be
to
apportion
it
based
on
residency.
i
believe
the
residency
requirement
here
is
very
analogous
to
that
in
zobel
because
that
involved
a
retrospective
feature.
it
also
involved
permanent
classifications
or
distinctions
between
citizens.
the
citizenship
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
equates
state
citizenship
with
simply
residency
and
that
clause
does
not
provide
for
and
does
not
permit
degrees
of
citizenship.
and,
that
is
exactly
what
is
happening
here
in
new
mexico.
they
are
creating
degrees
of
citizenship
in
which
those
who
arrived
after
may
8,
1976
have
a
second
class
citizenship
status.
as
i
indicated,
this
residency
requirement
is
essentially
the
same
as
a
durational
residency
requirement
in
that
it
divides
residents
into
those
who
came
at
an
earlier
time
and
those
who
came
after
may
8,
1976.
the
waiting
period
for
equality
under
this
statute
for
a
veteran
who
came
after
may
8,
1976
is
forever.
one
could
live
in
new
mexico
forever,
even
though
he
established
residency
on
may
9,
1976
and
he
never
would
get
this
benefit,
whereas,
a
veteran
living
in
that
state
for
one
day
at
any
time
prior
to
that
date
would
be
provided
the
benefit.
even
if
this
court
should
agree
that
this
residency
requirement
passes
the
rational
basis
test,
i
believe
it
should
go
further
and
subject
it
to
strict
scrutiny
because
of
its
impact
on
the
fundamental
right
to
travel.
the
court
has
indicated
that
the
fundamental
right
to
travel
prohibits
a
state
from
putting
newer
residents
at
a
disadvantage
or
otherwise
treating
them
differently
from
earlier
residents.
under
that
reasoning,
it
does
not
appear
permissible
for
new
mexico
to
penalize
those
who
exercise
their
fundamental
right
to
migrate
to
that
state
after
may
8,
1976.
the
court
in
the
shapiro
case
indicated
that
any
classification
which
penalizes
that
right
must
be
subjected
to
strict
scrutiny
and
will
not
survive
unless
it
is
found
necessary
to
promote
a
compelling
state
interest.
new
mexico
clearly
has
not
shown
any
compelling
interest
for
this
classification.
in
fact,
there
isn't
even
a
rational
basis
for
it
much
less
a
compelling
interest.
the
court
below
seemed
to
feel
that
the
only
kind
of
right
that...
the
denial
of
which
would
create
an
impact
on
the
fundamental
right
to
travel
were
those
rights
which
would
deter
migration
if
they,
in
fact,
were
denied.
this
court
has
clearly
indicated
that
actual
deterrent
is
not
required
in
order
to
create
an
impact
on
the
fundamental
right.
and,
i
would
point
out,
this
right
here
is
actually
very
synonymous
to
the
right
involved
in
the
zobel
case
and
the
concurring
members
of
this
court
clearly
believed
that
that
was
sufficient
impact
to
create
an
invalid...
that
created
an
invalid
impact
on
the
fundamental
right
to
travel.
furthermore,
this
tax
exemption
is
authorized
in
the
new
mexico
constitution
and
certainly
for
new
mexico
residents
it
is
considered
a
very
important
benefit.
the
fact
that
the
residency
requirement
itself...
i
mean
the
tax
exemption
statute
itself
serves
generally
legitimate
purposes
is
not
adequate.
the
residency
requirement
itself
must
satisfy
the
legitimate
purpose
and
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
any
legitimate
purpose
here
associated
with
this
statute.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
yes,
your
honor,
just
a
couple
of
comments.
i
note
that
the
assessor
persists
in
categorizing
this
statute
as
requiring
a
coincidence
of
military
service
and
residency
and
that
is
clearly
not
the
case
here.
the
statute,
until
its
amendment
in
1981,
did
require
that,
but
obviously
the
legislature
had
something
in
mind
when
they--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
agree
that
it
would
be
all
right.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
well,
not
necessarily,
because
even
if
they
had
said
you
had
to
be
a
resident
on
may
8,
1975,
for
example,
the
vietnam
service
could
have
occurred
in
1963
or
1964
and
you
still
wouldn't
have
the
coincidence
of
service.
the
person
could
have
moved
to
the
state
after
the
service
and
they
rely
exclusively
on
a
coincidence
of
military
service
and
residency
and
that
is
nowhere
required
in
the
statute.
in
fact,
it
was
taken
out
of
the
statute
specifically
in
1981.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
well,
that
certainly
is
a
much
more
significant
factor
than
what
is
involved
in
here.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
but,
that
is
not
the
situation.
the
example
that
i
gave,
the
veteran
having
served
in
1963
and
he
doesn't
show
up
until
12
years
later.
now,
are
you
going
to
presume
a
12-year
intent?
or
even
the
person
who
lived
in
new
mexico
many
years
ago
and
then
served
from
another
state--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--well,
in
all
these
other...
in
fact,
the
assessor
mentioned
that
this
simply
made
the
residency
requirement
for
vietnam
synonymous
with
the
other
wars.
that
is
not
the
case.
the
residency
requirement
for
those
other
wars
was
added
substantially
contemporaneously
with
the
date
itself.
it
was
only
prospective
kind
of
application.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
but
here
we
are
going
back
eight
years
prospectively
in
picking
up...
and
in
the
meantime
a
large
number
of
residents
such
as
appellants
in
this
case
moved
to
the
state.
and,
at
the
time
the
residency
requirement
was
enacted,
then
they
are
discriminating
against
those
residents.
whereas,
in
the
other
cases,
they
were
not.
one
other
thing
that
the
assessor
mentioned
was
the
unusual
generosity
of
new
mexico.
whether
a
state
gives
a
benefit
or
not
is
not
controlling
here,
it
is
how
it
apportions
that
benefit
regardless
of
how
generous
it
may
be
in
the
benefit.
i
am
not
complaining
about
whether
they
give
a
generous
benefit
or
not.
you
cannot
escape
the
prohibitions
against
discrimination.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
i
want
them
to
treat
me
equally
with
all
the
others
is
my
contention
in
this
case.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
give
the
benefit
in
the
first
place
or
not,
but
once
they
decide
to
give
it,
the
generosity
to
a
select
few
is
what
creates
the
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
1976,
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
that
is
exactly
right.
if
you
allow
this
tax
exemption
in
this
case,
you
are
indirectly--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--a
one-shot
deal
would
not
be
the
same,
but
if
you
allow--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--i
wouldn't
be
qualified
for
it.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
but,
if
you
allow
the
exemption
in
this
case,
you
are
also
allowing
new
mexico
to
have
a
different
income
tax
system
for
those
who
arrived
before
1976
and
those
who
arrived
thereafter
or
charge
a
different
sales
tax
rate
or
what
would
prevent
the
state
in
1983
from
saying
welfare
benefits
such
as
involved
in
shapiro
will
only
be
available
to
those
who
are
residents
of
the
state
prior
to
may
8,
1976.
that
is
exactly
what
this
statute--
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
--this
case
is
not
distinguishable
from
the
zobel
case
on
the
privileges
and
immunities
issue.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
zobel,
to
me,
turned
on
a
theory
of
equality
of
citizenship
and
equal
protection.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
but,
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
zobel
on
the
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
alvin
d.
hooper
you
did
not
decide
zobel
on
that
basis
and
i
would
suggest
that
zobel
controls
this
case.
