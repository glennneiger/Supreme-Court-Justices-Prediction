we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
hooper
against
county
assessor.
mr.
hooper,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
what
would
you
say
about
a
statute
of
the
state
which
had
been
enacted
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
followed
the
pattern
of
the
civil
war
bonuses
and
provided
that
every
resident
every
person
domiciled
in
the
state
who
entered
the
military
service
would
receive
a
bonus
of
$1,000?
they
hand
it
to
him
when
he
comes
back
from
the
recruiting
station.
chief
justice
burger
would
you
have
any
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
farr?
chief
justice
burger
would
you
see
any
problem,
mr.
farr,
if
they
had
this
same
kind
of
a
plan
in
the
state
from
which
he
moved
so
that
he
got
a
bonus
back
at
the
hometown
and
then
got
one
here?
chief
justice
burger
you
intimate
that
they
could
constitutionally
do
that.
chief
justice
burger
but,
if
they
have
got
a
tax
exemption
back
in
the
home
state,
then
they
would
just
be
continuing
their
tax
exempt
status
in
your
view
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
sounds
to
me
a
little
bit
more,
mr.
hooper,
like
privileges
and
immunities
argument
than
a
right
to
travel
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
zobel
turned
on
what
theory--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--equal
protection
clause,
but
not
on
the
privileges
and
immunities.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
saying
that
we
could
not
decide
this
case
or
should
not
decide
it
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
