well,
aren't
we
really
talking
about
uncoordinated
independent
spending?
justice
white
i
mean,
i
thought...
can't
the
election
commission
already
get
at
coordinated
spending
when
it
gets
close
enough
that
it
can
really
be
be
blamed
on
the
candidate?
justice
white
yes.
to
sustain
this
law,
you're
going
to
have
to
convince
that
the
congress
can
do
what
it
did
to
wholly
uncoordinated
committees.
justice
white
what
was
the
second
case
you
referred
to?
justice
white
this
is
a
statutory
argument,
i
take
it?
justice
white
and
what
did
the
district
court
say
to
you
about
that?
justice
white
then
the
district
court
didn't
address
it?
justice
white
and
you're
making
an
alternative
argument
for
affirmance?
justice
white
i
would
think
the
district
court
would
have
had
to
reach
the
statutory
argument
first,
if
you
presented
it.
