justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
steele,
notwithstanding
those
concerns
expressed
by
congress,
what
about
the
fact
that
in
buckley
versus
valeo
spending
by
political
associations
was
treated
as
expenditures
entitled
to
protection
under
the
first
amendment,
full
protection?
isn't
that
the
problem
that
you
have
to
deal
with
here?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
that
the
interest
for
purely
independent
political
associations
is
different
than
that
in
buckley
versus
valeo?
justice
o'connor
let
me
interrupt
you
once
more,
mr.
steele,
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
buckley
when
the
court
upheld
the
provision
limiting
contributions,
that
one
of
the
reasons
the
court
gave
for
doing
that
was
that
individuals
could
contribute
to
political
associations
and
pool
their
resources
and
gain
expression
in
that
fashion.
and
yet
you're
now
saying
that
that
aspect
can
be
curtailed
as
well.
so
i'm
just
wondering
how
consistent
that
is
with
buckley.
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
a
pretty
hollow
right,
to
just
join
the
association,
if
the
association
is
then
limited
to
spending
$1,000.
justice
o'connor
that
isn't
much
of
a
right
then,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
can
a
political
committee
simply
avoid
the
limit
by
publishing
a
periodical
that
endorses
a
candidate
in
an
editorial?
justice
o'connor
well,
could
one
of
these
committees,
no
matter
how
characterized,
simply
avoid
any
limitation
by
publishing
some
kind
of
periodical?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
it's
more
than
a
contribution
right,
isn't
it?
at
least
as
relied
upon
by
this
court
in
buckley,
it
was
a
right
to
speak,
if
you
will,
as
an
individual
through
a
group
means,
by
means
of
pooling
your
assets
to
amplify
your
voice.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
congress
could
regulate
the
extent
to
which
committees
must
require
participation,
but
it
hasn't
chosen
to
do
that.
justice
o'connor
but
be
that
as
it
may,
that
is
a
subject
that
congress
could
regulate,
presumably?
justice
o'connor
would
you
reject,
then,
completely
as
a
valid
goal
the
preservation
of
public
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
elections?
