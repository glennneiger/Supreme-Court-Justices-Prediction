mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
our
position
in
these
cases
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
section
9012(f)
apply
to
limiting
independent
expenditures.
we
say
that
because
of
the
congressional
history
and
legislative
debate
surrounding
section
9012
in
the
fund
act
passed
in
1971
and
its
predecessor
legislation,
the
honest
election
act
of
1967.
and
we
say
so
because
of
the
wording
of
the
statute
itself.
secondly,
we
contend
that
if
the
statute
is
construed
by
this
court
to
reach
independent
expenditures,
then
it
cannot
survive
and
that
it
unconstitutional,
because
it
may
be
sustained
only
if
it
fosters
the
goal
of
guarding
against
real
or
apparent
corruption.
and
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
legislative
evidence
of
connection
between
independent
expenditures
and
corruption,
nor
is
there
any
record
evidence
of
such
a
connection.
this
statute
is
a
criminal
statute
which
operates
in
an
inarguably
first
amendment
area.
as
such,
we
suggest
that
it
should
be
read
and
construed
narrowly.
section
9012(f)
was
lifted
almost
word
for
word
from
section
310(f)
of
the
honest
elections
act
of
1967.
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
have
argued
to
the
court
that
the
legislative
debate
surrounding
that
statute
is
pertinent
here.
section
310(f)
was
the
result
of
a
compromise
between
senator
long,
who
wanted
simply
to
fund
presidential
elections...
and
the
'67
act
also
funded
senatorial
elections...
and
do
no
more,
and
those
who,
led
by
senator
gore,
wanted
not
only
to
fund
presidential
and
senatorial
elections,
but
in
aid
of
that
public
funding
wanted
to
limit
expenditures
by
others.
310(f)
was
a
compromise
between
those
views.
we
believe
that
the
legislative
debate
surrounding
310(f)
shows
that
what
9012(f),
which
is
the
successor
to
310(f),
was
intended
to
do
was
force
publicly
funded
candidates
to
live
within
the
budget
provided
by
the
public
grant,
by
limiting
expenditures
by
party-connected
non-authorized
committees
to
pay...
and
this
is
the
language
from
the
senate
report
about
the
honest
elections
act...
"for
a
candidate's
expenses".
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
your
honor,
i
made
this
argument
in
my
papers,
but
i
did
not
in
oral
argument
before
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
it
did
not,
your
honor.
i
take
it--
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
i'm
seeking
to
provide
this
court
with
a
way
of
avoiding
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
i
presented
it
in
my
papers,
but
not
in
argument,
your
honor.
what
was
happening
in
1967
and
what
congress
had
seen
happening
was
that
party-connected
but
unauthorized
committees...
that
is,
committees
that
had
not
been
authorized
in
writing
by
the
candidate
to
make
expenditures
on
the
candidate's
behalf...
were
out
paying
expenses
for
the
candidate,
paying
for
his
trips
into
a
state,
for
instance.
that
is
what
congress
struck
at
in
the
'67
act
and,
we
urge
by
implication,
in
9012(f).
now,
in
1971
there
was
precious
little
debate
about
the
true
intent
of
section
9012(f).
what
debate
there
is,
however,
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
and
that
centers
on
a
debate
between
senator
pastore
and
his
opposition.
curiously
enough...
and
we
readily
concede
this...
senator
pastore
is
the
only
one
who
discussed
independent
expenditures,
and
he
argued
both
sides
of
the
case.
at
one
time
he
said
9012(f)
was
not
intended
to
reach
independent
expenditures.
so
long
as
the
people
are
independent
of
the
candidate,
they
are
free
to
speak
as
they
will,
he
said.
he
is
the
only
one,
on
the
other
hand,
who
suggested
at
one
point
in
his
debate
that
it
might
reach
independent
expenditures.
but
in
the
end
he
came
back
to
his
original
position,
which
was
that
it
was
not
intended
to
reach
independent
expenditures.
his
opposition,
following
the
lead
of
senator
gore
back
in
1967,
who
was
then
no
longer
in
the
senate,
wanted
to
expand
section
9012(f)
and
to
have
it
reach
all
manner
of
groups,
everyone
save
individuals.
they
were
unsuccessful
in
that.
their
effort
was
turned
back.
the
debate
on
the
'67
act
and
the
71
act
is
extensive.
i
have
read
many,
many
pages
of
it.
and
i
may
be
wrong
on
this,
but
i
believe
i
can
say
to
this
court
that
nowhere
in
that
debate
does
congress
address
independent
expenditures
by
independent
groups.
the
concern
back
them
was
non-authorized
but
party-connected
committees,
because,
frankly,
big-time
independent
expenditures
did
not
exist
back
then.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
we
believe
that
it
now
reaches,
that
it
was
intended
to
reach,
only
party-connected
expenditures
for
a
candidate
on
his
behalf
or
those
that
were
otherwise
somehow
coordinated
with
him,
at
his
request
or
suggestion.
and
we
readily
concede
that
if
the
court
construes
it
that
way,
then
section
9012(f)
today
is
redundant
and
unnecessary,
because
since
'71
when
the
act
was
passed
congress
has
now
characterized
such
expenditures
as
in-kind
contributions.
in
1974
they
did
so.
so
now
the
fund
act
would
be
redundant...
or,
excuse
me,
9012(f)
would
be
redundant,
if
this
court
read
it
that
way.
but
we
are
looking
at
congressional
intent
in
1971,
and
the
fund
act
has
not
been
tampered
with
since.
congress
has
been
silent.
we
believe
that
the
very
wording
of
9012(f)
itself
supports
our
argument.
that
statute
prohibits
not
all
expenditures,
not
any
expenditures,
not
independent
expenditures,
but
only
those
which,
if
incurred
by
a
candidate
or
his
authorized
committee,
would
further
his
election.
we
believe
that
that
awkward
wording
itself
suggests
that
what
congress
was
striking
at
were
expenses
paid
for
a
candidate.
and
there
are
other
common
sense
basic
principles
of
statutory
construction
which
we
believe
support
our
contention
that
the
statute
should
be
read
that
way.
one,
congress
knew
how
to
outlaw
all
or
independent
expenditures
when
it
wanted
to.
this
court
had
no
trouble
understanding
that
that's
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
608(e)(1)
in
buckley.
congress
didn't
do
so.
two,
if
congress
was
really
concerned
about
independent
expenditures
and
the
real
or
apparent
corruption
of
expenditures,
of
independent
expenditures
on
candidates,
then
they
struck
at
that
goal
in
a
curious
way
when
they
exempted
wealthy
individuals.
and
wealthy
individuals
existed
back
before
1971
and
they
certainly
exist
now.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
ten
individuals
spent
more
than
one
million
dollars
to
support
mr.
reagan's
election
in
1980.
one
of
them
spent
sore
than
a
half
a
million
dollars.
and
finally,
it
is
curious
that
congress
put
no
similar
independent
expenditure
limitation,
if
that's
what
it
is,
in
the
primary
act.
there
is
no
restriction
upon
independent
expenditures
during
the
presidential
primary
campaign,
even
though
that
campaign
is
publicly
funded.
now,
this
court
in
buckley
upheld
the
fund
act
on
two
grounds:
first
as
a
means
of
eliminating
the
influence
of
large
private
corruptions...
excuse
me,
contributions;
and
secondly,
as
a
means
of
relieving
candidates
of
the
rigors
of
fund-raising.
section
9012(f)
furthers
neither
of
those
goals,
for:
first,
it
addresses
expenditures,
not
contributions;
and
secondly,
candidates
are
already
publicly
funded;
they
no
longer
have
to
face
the
ordeal
of
fund-raising.
each
of
them
in
1984
received
$40
million
in
furtherance
of
his
campaign.
in
addition,
because
9012(f)
exempts
individuals
and
exempts
the
institutions
of
the
press
and
broadcast
media,
it
is
woefully
underinclusive
and
leaves
the
field
of
independent
expenditures
wide
open
to
those
influential
groups
and
individuals.
where
a
statute,
like
9012(f)
does,
operates
in
an
area
of
first
amendment
freedoms,
it
can
be
upheld
only
if
it
serves
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
and
even
then
only
if
it
is
narrowly
drawn
to
achieve
that
end.
since
buckley
it
has
been
clear
that
when
a
statute
limits
campaign
expenditures
the
only
compelling
interest
sufficient
to
uphold
the
statute
is
the
avoidance
of
real
or
apparent
corruption.
we
have
already
argued
that
congress
did
not
intend
in
9012(f)
to
reach
independent
expenditures.
but
if
the
court
finds
that
it
did,
then
buckley
teaches
that
corruption
must
be
the
evil
aimed
at
by
that
statute,
and
only
corruption.
and
it
was
not.
there
was
much
talk
about
corruption
resulting
from
contributions,
but
not
from
independent
expenditures.
indeed,
there
was
precious
little,
if
any,
talk
about
independent
expenditures,
because
they
almost
didn't
exist
back
when
the
fund
act
was
being
passed.
secondly,
there
is
no
legislative
connection
whatever
between
independent
expenditures
and
corruption.
first,
as
i
said,
because
independent
expenditures
almost
didn't
exist;
and
secondly,
because
in
1976
this
court
found...
and
the
record
before
it
was
a
complete
record...
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
corruption
sufficient
to
uphold
an
independent
expenditure
limitation.
it's
no
wonder,
then,
that
congress
didn't
find
corruption
in
1971.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
it
was
indeed
concerned
about
corruption
arising
from
contributions,
your
honor,
not
from
independent
expenditures.
it
was
indeed
concerned
about
corruption,
and
it
was
to
relieve
the
possibility
of
corruption
from
direct
contributions
to
candidates
that
it
said:
we
will
not
permit
those;
instead,
we
will
publicly
fund
the
candidates,
and
they
may
not
ask
for
nor
may
they
accept
contributions.
just
as
in
1976
there
is
no
record
evidence
of
corruption,
there
is
none
in
1984.
the
district
court
exhaustively
examined
the
record.
the
record
consisted
of
more
than
200
stipulations.
and
it
noted
the
complete
absence
of
any
real
or
apparent
corruption.
it
found
little
more
than
what
it
considered
things
to
be
in
the
mainstream
of
american
political
tradition.
but
the
democrats
apparently
were
concerned
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
direct
corruption,
so
what
they
tried
to
do
was
persuade
the
lower
court
that
there
was
an
appearance
of
corruption.
and
they
tried
to
do
that
through
a
poll,
a
public
opinion
poll.
the
lower
court
discussed
this.
it
properly
rejected
that
poll
because,
in
its
view...
and
we
hope
it
is
this
court's
view
as
well:
"the
constitutionality
of
legislation
ought
not
to
turn
on
a
national
plebiscite.
"
"it
is
for
congress
to
find...
it
is
for
congress
to
find
the
reality
or
appearance
of
corruption,
and
not
the
man
on
the
street.
"
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
way
congress
would
find
such
corruption,
the
proper
way,
would
be
for
it
to
hold
public
hearings
and
take
testimony.
it's
an
appealing
notion
that
legislation
ought
to
be
passed
on
by
plebiscite,
but
if
so
it
has
to
be--
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
--for
instance.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
we
didn't
have
our
poll.
we
would
have
loved
to
have
our
polls
in
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
it
would
indeed,
and
we
think
that
the
legitimacy
of
this
statute
should
not
turn
on
the
answers
of
a
few
thousand
people
who
were
asked
a
couple
of
questions
over
a
weekend
a
couple
of
years
ago.
secondly,
this
statute
is
not
narrowly
drawn
to
achieve
what
can
only
be
the
only
legitimate
goal,
which
is
the
avoidance
of
corruption.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
no,
ma'am,
i
would
not.
i
believe
that's
a
perfectly
legitimate
goal
of
congress.
but
it's
not
one
that
they
expressed
in
passing
this
legislation.
this
statute
is
not
narrowly
drawn
to
achieve
its
end.
there
are
other,
more
narrow
means
to
achieve
the
end
sought
here,
if
this
is
the
end
that
congress
sought,
and
they
are
elsewhere
provided
in
the
act,
again
suggesting
that
congress
really
did
not
have
the
outlawing
of
independent
expenditures
in
mind.
first,
there
can
be
and
there
are
elsewhere
in
the
federal
election
laws
requirements
of
disclosure
of
independent
expenditures.
ncpac
and
fcm's
independent
expenditures
are
publicly
reported
to
the
federal
election
commission.
all
of
their
expenditures,
all
of
their
public
communications
for
and
against
funded
candidates,
and
all
others,
by
the
way,
contain
disclaimers
of
any
connection
with
the
candidate
and
identification
of
the
group
that
is
speaking.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
donors
to--
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor;
not
just
gross
amounts.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
steele
will
probably
correct
me
on
this--
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
--there's
a
$50
or
a
$200
threshold,
below
which
i
don't
think
the
donors'
names
must
be
disclosed.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
if
there
is
i'm
not
aware
of
one.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
similarity
of
contributors?
i'm
not
aware
that
such
a
study
has
been
done,
your
honor.
finally,
groups
like
ncpac
are
prohibited
from
reproducing
a
candidate's
campaign
materials
and
there
are
limits
on
the
amount
of
contributions
to
political
committees.
all
of
those
are
less
restrictive,
but
just
as
effective
means,
that
already
exist
in
the
statute.
congress
need
not
have
taken
the
meataxe
approach
that
it
did
here
of
all
but
outlawing
all
effective
independent
expenditures.
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
your
honor,
let
me
hasten
to
say
that
i
didn't
intend
to
concede
that--
mr.
robert
r.
sparks,
jr.
--all
right,
your
honor.
justice
rehnquist,
a
while
ago
you
were
asking
questions
about
this
court's
right
to
work
opinion
and
whether
or
not
it
simply
controls
this
case
and
resolves
the
issue
altogether.
it
does
not,
for
two
reasons:
first,
as
mr.
feirson
pointed
out,
the
fec
has
a
regulation
which
says
that
political
committees
may
incorporate
and
yet
still
avoid
the
proscriptions
on
corporate
expenditures
contained
in
441(b).
they
may
incorporate
for
liability
purposes
only.
and
two,
the
statute
which
is
before
this
court
today
restricts
expenditures
by
political
committees,
which
are
defined
in
the
fund
act
and
in
the
federal
election
campaign
act
as
including
groups
incorporated
or
otherwise.
so
that
this
case,
albeit
with
an
unincorporated
political
committee,
would
be
before
this
court
today
if
this
court
viewed
the
fec's
regulation
as
not
disposing
of
that
issue.
your
honors,
throughout
the
fec's
and
dnc's
briefs
they
refer
to
us
as
being
a
nominally
independent,
professionally
run,
effective;
that
the
candidate
knows
who
is
helping
him
and
why.
at
one
point
one
of
the
appellants
refers
to
the
ability
of
groups
like
appellees
to
exert
significant
influence
on
the
political
process.
we
think
that
these
are
all
code
words
for
saying
that
we're
effective
and
that,
because
we're
effective,
our
speech
ought
to
be
choked
off.
we
do
not
understand
the
law
to
permit
that.
mr.
steele
suggested
in
his
argument
that
the
messages
of
the
publicly
funded
candidates
are
somehow
being
interfered
with
by
the
independent
expenditures
engaged
in
by
appellees
here.
we
are
not
aware
that
anybody
in
america
feels
that
the
candidates
were
not
able
to
get
their
messages
across.
they
also
refer
to
our
expenditures
as
a
mere
subsidy
or
a
supplement.
those
too
are
code
words.
they
suggest
that
we
are
somehow
coordinated
with
the
publicly
funded
candidate.
that
is
not
so.
in
fact,
in
1980
common
cause
and
the
carter-mondale
committee
filed
administrative
complaints
against
both
appellees
here
and,
after
almost
three
years
of
investigation,
the
fec
came
up
empty-handed.
it
took
no
action
against
us
whatsoever
on
the
coordination
claims
or
on
any
other
claim.
the
fact
is,
we're
not
coordinated.
finally
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
mr.
steele
suggests
that
because
of
appellees
and
their
independent
expenditures
the
candidates
might
somehow
be
beholden
to
our
appellees.
first
of
all,
there's
no
record
whatever...
no
record
evidence
whatever
on
that
score.
secondly,
please
consider
what
mr.
steele
is
really
suggesting.
what
he
is
saying
is
that,
because
our
candidates...
our
clients,
who
pool
small
contributions
of
many
ordinary
citizens,
citizens
of
ordinary
means,
and
spend
those
in
support
of
a
candidate,
that
those
expenditures
might
cause
the
candidate
to
pay
attention
to
those
voters.
well,
that
is
the
american
way,
as
we
understand
it.
what
mr.
steele
is
really
concerned
about
is
that
these
expenditures
might
be
effective,
and
that
a
candidate
might
realize
that
the
voters
are
getting
his
message
and
would
be
responsive
to
those
voters.
well,
that
is
the
point
of
the
process
as
we
understand
it.
in
short,
it
seems
to
be
appellants'
position
that
groups
like
ncpac
and
pcm
and
their
many
contributors
are
better
see
and
not
heard;
that
they
are
to
troop
to
the
polls
obediently
every
election
day
and
vote
and
go
home;
that
they
can
participate
through
the
party
process,
but
through
no
other.
we
think
that
in
this
case
silence
is
not
golden,
that
this
statute
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
reach
independent
expenditures,
but
if
it
was
it
can't.
thank
you.
