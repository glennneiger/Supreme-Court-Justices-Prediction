we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
the
federal
election
commission
against
the
national
conservative
political
action
committee
and
the
related
case.
mr.
steele,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
how
does
the
statute
or
the
combination
of
them
reach
an
independent
political
action
committee
not
coordinated
with
anyone
and
not
for
any
candidate,
but
against
a
candidate,
against
any
candidate
who
supports
x,
y
or
z
positions?
chief
justice
burger
and
you
don't
think
that's
any
impairment
of
the
first
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
go
back
to
your
statement
that
fixing
the
amounts
is
for
congress.
and
of
course
conceding
that
generally
that's
true,
suppose
instead
of
$1,000
it
was
$100.
same?
chief
justice
burger
and
$50?
chief
justice
burger
one
dollar?
chief
justice
burger
what
could
you
do...
how
much
first
amendment
expression
can
you
engage
in
for
one
dollar
or
$50
or
$100?
chief
justice
burger
well,
wouldn't
the
one
dollar
in
effect
stop?
wouldn't
that
be
an
almost
absolute
barrier
to
expression?
chief
justice
burger
then
it
is
the
same
as
though
congress
would
say,
no,
no
committees
would
be
permitted
to
express
themselves.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
feirson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
mistake.
the
light
seems
to
be
out
of
order,
mr.
marshall.
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sparks.
chief
justice
burger
yes,
exactly.
well,
wouldn't
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
a
plebiscite
or
a
poll
depend
on
who
framed
the
question?
chief
justice
burger
are
the
names
of
the
donors
required
to
be
disclosed?
chief
justice
burger
in
the
report
to
the
commission?
chief
justice
burger
no
matter
what
the
amount
is?
chief
justice
burger
i
think
there
was
a
bottom
limit.
chief
justice
burger
has
there
ever
been
any
study
made
by
congress
or
by
anyone,
a
public
study,
as
to
the
coordination
or
the
incidence
of
donors
to
both
the
independent
committee
and
a
party
committee?
chief
justice
burger
that
would
be
evidence
of
coordination,
i
suppose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
steele?
you
have
now
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
burger
let
me
try
another
hypothetical
on
you
that
i
think
has
some
historical
background.
a
national
campaign
with
a
third
party
candidate
for
president,
who
by
all
realistic
analyses
has
no
prospect.
but
independent,
totally
independent,
uncoordinated
committees
are
formed
to
support
him,
with
the
predictable
result
that
it
will
drain
votes
off
of
one
of
the
candidates.
and
let's
even
assume
that
their
purpose
is
to
drain
votes
off
of
one
candidate.
and
what
about
that?
now
they're
supporting
a
candidate,
but
it
has
that
consequence.
can
the
commission
go
behind
the
surface
and
say
this
is
a
corrupt
effort
to
influence
the
election?
not
to
elect
this
man,
but
to
influence
the
election
for
one
of
the
other
two
major
party
candidates?
chief
justice
burger
my
hypothetical
is
that
this
third
party
fellow
didn't
get
any
public
funding.
he
got
no
public
funding
at
all.
chief
justice
burger
what
section
of
the
statute
would
you
rely
on
for
that?
chief
justice
burger
well,
a
good
many
people
would
think
that
some
of
the
third
party
candidates
were
injected
and
supported
for
precisely
the
reason
i
set
up
in
my
hypothetical
in
the
past.
so
that
it's
not
such
a
far-fetched
idea,
is
it?
chief
justice
burger
could
the
commission
get
at
that
before
the
election,
or
only
by
a
criminal
proceeding
after
the
election?
chief
justice
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
