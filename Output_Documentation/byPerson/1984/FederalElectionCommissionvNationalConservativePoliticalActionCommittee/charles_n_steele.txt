mr.
charles
n.
steele
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
consolidated
cases
present
two
issues.
there
is
an
initial
jurisdictional
issue,
an
issue
that
we
have
raised
with
regard
to
the
second
of
the
two
cases,
as
to
the
standing
of
the
democratic
party
and
the
jurisdiction
under
section
9011(b)
of
the
act,
their
jurisdiction
to
bring
it.
i
consider
that
that
issue
has
been
covered
thoroughly,
the
arguments
on
both
sides,
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
filed
by
the
democratic
party,
and
did
not
intend
to
address
it
at
this
point
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
we
do
not
consider
that
it
is,
because
as
we
read
the
statute
it
seems
to
us
that,
though
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
fec
to
raise
those
issues,
that
the
question
in
the
statutory
construction,
that
congress
did
not
intend
private
parties
to
be
suing
each
other,
is
the
same
issue.
so
we
think
that
the
two
are
severable.
with
regard
to
the
central
question
posed
by
this
case,
which
we
would
say
is
the
power
of
congress
to
limit
aggregations
and
expenditures
of
wealth
by
political
committees,
which
are
organizations
whose
purpose
is
to
influence
the
outcome
of
federal
elections.
where
presidential
candidates
have
agreed
to
accept
public
funds
in
lieu
of
private
financings
for
their
campaigns,
we
would
say
that
there
is
no
limitation
in
the
constitution
or
particularly
in
the
first
amendment
on
the
power
of
congress
to
limit
those
expenditures
as
it
is
done
here.
this
case
arose
because
the
appellees,
two
political
committees,
asked
the
commission,
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
1981
term
in
common
cause
versus
schmitt,
in
which
this
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
by
a
four
to
four
vote,
the
appellees
asked
the
commission
for
an
advisory
opinion.
they
asked
for
an
advisory
opinion
to
the
effect
that
that
decision
made
such
expenditures
in
excess
of
the
limitations
of
9012(f)...
were
permitted
under
the
statute.
the
commission
answered
in
an
advisory
opinion
that
it
did
not
think
that
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
was
dispositive
of
the
constitutional
issues,
and
reaffirmed
in
that
advisory
opinion
its
earlier
opinion
that
congress
had
in
9012(f)
banned
expenditures
by
political
committees
in
amounts
greater
than
$1,000
where
presidential
candidates
have
accepted
the
public
financing.
there
are
really
two
reasons
that
we
see
why
this
statute
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
first
of
all,
congress
found
that
there
was
a
great
necessity
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
government
and
the
public
perception
of
the
integrity,
the
public
confidence
in
the
government,
from
the
corrosive
effects
of
public
financing.
and
that
was
well
documented
to
congress.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
private
financing,
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
i
did.
and
congress
had
long
considered
these
issues.
they
had
felt
that
a
system
in
which
they
could
have...
set
up
public
financing
which
would
substitute
for
private
financing,
was
one
which
could
reduce
those
effects.
the
second
reason
that
we
think
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
bar
what
congress
here
has
done
is
that
congress
has
very
consciously
and
deliberately
in
this
statute
left
ample
scope
for
individual
and
group
expression.
turning
first
to
the
question
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
of
what
congress
sought
to
achieve,
we
think
that
the
record
demonstrates
that
congress
knew
what
the
effects
would
be
where
it
had
passed
the
public
financing
statute
after
years
of
debate,
a
statute
which
limited
expenditures,
which
prohibited
contributions
to
the
candidates,
and
which
created
a
system
in
which
public
financing
was
not
merely
a
subsidy
to
the
candidates
of
the
two
major
parties,
but
was
seen
as
only
a
substitute
in
which
public
financing
was
the
major
part
of
the
package
in
which
other
forms
of
expenditures
were
limited.
but
congress
knew
that
committees
such
as
these
would
take
over
the
role
that
had
previously
been
held
by
large
contributors,
and
it
was
one
of
the
factors
that
was
very
prominent
in
the
debate
in
front
of
congress;
indeed,
as
we
have
set
it
forth
in
our
reply
brief,
the
debate
which
went
on
not
only
in
1971,
which
went
on
way
back
into
the
history
of
these
statutes
in
1966
and
'67,
when
there
were
long,
long
debates
in
the
senate.
but
congress
estimated
and
looked
at
the
question
of
whether,
if
you
prohibited
these
private
contributions
and
came
forward
with
public
financing,
would
there
not
be
a
situation
where
private
financing
would
come
forward
making
expenditures
which
were
not
in
control
of
the
candidate
or
in
control
of
the
candidates'
parties,
but
which
would
be
done
by
committees
composed
of
the
candidates'
supporters,
composed
of
people
who
were,
as
i
say,
in
the
business
of
raising
and
expending
funds
to
influence
the
elections.
and
congress
concluded
that
they
were.
congress
concluded
that
in
that
situation
you
would
have
in
effect
a
candidate
who
would
be
beholden
to
these
large
aggregations
of
private
funds,
a
candidate
whose
campaign
was
limited
to
$40
million
in
this
recent
election
under
public
financing,
but
who
looked
out
there
and
saw
that
groups
were
available
who
could
make
those
expenditures
on
his
behalf,
millions
of
dollars,
campaigns
that
replace
and
support
his
campaign,
that
the
effect
would
essentially
be
the
same,
that
he
would
wind
up
in
the
election
needing
to
woo
that
private
money,
needing
to
know
that
that
private
money
would
come
forward
on
his
behalf,
and
thus
would
be
in
the
long
run
beholden
to
that
private
money
in
the
same
way
that
he
would
have
been
beholden
in
the
situation
where
there
were
private
contributions.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
congress...
i
know
of
no
place
that
congress
actually
considered
that
as
an
alternative.
in
the
course
of
the
debates,
congress
considered
a
variety
of
ways
of
trying
to
limit
this
problem.
the
difficulty
in
all
of
them,
i
think,
for
congress
was
the
belief
that
was
strongly
argued
that
if
you
did
not
reach
out
to
the
committees,
that
you
were
going
to
have
a
difficulty
with
the
standard
of
committees
that
seemed
to
be
composed
of
supporters;
that
at
some
point...
what
they
were
always
debating
was
the
reach
of
the
statute,
of
how
far
it
could
reach.
and
where
they
drew
the
line
was
to
the
very
political
committees
that
are
in
the
business.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
the
concerns
that
congress
expressed
throughout
it
were,
however,
there's
another
countervailing
interest,
which
is
in
not
having
someone
make
a
determination
in
the
two
months
before
the
election
that
the
funding
should
be
reduced.
in
other
words,
one
of
the
things
that
congress
saw
was
a
system
where
there
would
be
an
immediate
block
grant
known
in
its
amount
to
the
candidate,
and
that
there
would
be
a
grave
danger
that
you
would
be
interfering
with
the
very
speech
of
the
candidate
which
the
public
fund
was
attempting
to
support
if
you
got
into
a
system
where
someone,
the
federal
election
commission
or
some
form
of
decisionmaker,
would
have
to
decide,
well,
that
group
is
so
allied
with
the
candidate
that
we'll
reduce
the
candidate's
funds.
and
i
think
that
they
saw
great
difficulty
with
systems
that
involve
that
kind
of
interference.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
we
are.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
commission
under
the
statute
can
deal
with
that.
i
would
say
two
things:
one,
that
there
is
tremendous
difficulty
in
dealing
with
that
in
any
period
before
the
election.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes.
i
think
that
congress
spoke
of
it
in
many
terms.
they
spoke
of
it
as
the
fact
that
they
knew
from
past
experience,
they
knew
from
their
own
personal
experience.
i
mean,
the
debates
are
full
of
indications
that
they
knew
in
their
own
personal
experience
the
ways
that
private
money
would
flow
into
the
system.
they
had
historical
examples
in
front
of
them
of
how
previous
statutes
where
they
had
had
narrow
definitions
of
the
terms
"contribution"
and
"expenditure",
where
political
committees
sprang
up,
that
there
was
no
ability
to
prove
immediate
coordination,
where
there
was
perhaps
no
need
for
coordination
in
the
sense
of
direct
contact
about
expenditures,
but
spoke
of
the
need
for
control
of
expenditures
where
they
were
done
by
political
committees,
particularly
ones
that
comprised...
there
was
a
good
deal
of
conversation
about
the
presidents
clubs
and
things
that
were
rot
directly
in
the
control.
and
that
what
congress
foresaw
and
what
congress
predicted,
what
congress
held
long
hearings
on,
was
the
very
questions
that
are
presently
before
this
court:
how
could
it
devise
a
system
by
some
method
which
would
allow
it
to
reach
out
and
counteract
the
evil
it
saw
in
political
committees
that
were
composed
of
people
who
were
supporters
of
a
presidential
candidate?
because
it
felt
that
if
it
did
not
control
to
some
degree
those,
that
it
would
have
a
system
in
which
you
would
have
unlimited
private
spending,
where
the
candidate
would
be
held
back,
where
the
candidates'
party
is
held
back,
and
where
the
balance
would
be
overthrown.
and
in
that
sense,
i
think
that
the
'67
debates
that
we
have
set
forth
are
very
prominently
figured
there,
because
the
original
long
act
was
a
proposition
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
1966
and
which
then
in
1967,
in
a
six-week
debate
in
front
of
the
senate,
was
eventually
made
ineffective
until
further
legislation
was
passed.
the
very
subject
in
debate
there
was
the
question
of
whether
a
subsidy
to
the
two
major
parties
with
no
restrictions
of
any
kind
on
it,
no
restrictions
at
that
stage
on
contributions
to
the
candidate's
party
or
to
the
candidate,
a
variety
of
other
restrictions,
no
accountability.
the
congress
debated
the
issue,
in
a
sense,
of
whether
or
not...
what
you
had
to
do
to
have
control
of
that
private
financing
in
a
public
financing
situation.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
in
the
public
financing
situation,
the
commission
interpreting
the
provisions
of
the
statute
here
in
question,
9012(f),
has
said
that
where
you
have...
again,
the
public
financing
statute
deals
with
major
party
candidates.
but
taking
the
question
as
dealing
with
major
party
candidates,
that
the
expenditure
of
funds
against
one
of
those
candidates
is
to
further
the
election
of
the
other
candidate.
so
that
the
way
the
statute
deals
with
that
is--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--no,
i
would
say
that
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the...
again,
i
think
there's
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
there,
but
that
the
fact
that
a
negative
expenditure
can
be
to
further
the
election,
i
think
that
there's
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
that
would
permit
in
a
sense
only
negative
expenditures
but
not
positive
expenditures;
that
the
reach
of
the
first
amendment
would
be
equal
with
regards
to
those.
as
well
as
the
question
that
was
before
the
congress...
and
as
i
say,
i
think
that
the
one
major
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
congress
knew
the
problem
it
was
facing,
discussed
it
in
great
detail,
had
hearings
on
it,
had
testimony
in
what
was,
i
would
re-emphasize,
a
very
broad
constitutional
debate.
it
was
not
solely
a
constitutional
debate
about
the
issue
of
the
control
of
expenditures.
there
was
also
a
constitutional
debate
about
the
propriety
of
the
check-off,
which
this
court
resolved
in
buckley
versus
valeo.
there
were
proposals
to
have
the
check-off
allow
people
to
designate
their
parties
on
the
check-off,
which
was
felt
by
many
necessary
not
to
interfere
with
the
political
parties.
there
was
also
a
very
strong
debate
about
how
to
structure
a
public
financing
law
so
that
it
would
not
interfere
with
the
rights
of
third
parties,
and
one
of
the
factors,
if
there
is
no
control
on
independent
expenditures,
is
that
the
subsidy
that
is
then
put
forth
puts
third
parties
at
a
greater
disadvantage.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
would
deal
with
it
in
two
ways.
one,
i
would
say
that
i
think
this
court's
analysis
in
buckley
versus
valeo
made
it
very
clear
that
that
was
in
a
balancing
test.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
has
said
in
buckley,
i
think
in
subsequent
cases...
i
would
cite
to
both
the
bellotti
case
and
the
carc
case...
that
this
court
has
spoken
in
terms
of
if
independent
expenditures
do
pose
a
danger...
and
that
is
of
course
the
question
that
was
in
front
of
congress
and
in
that
sense
is
in
front
of
this
court.
but
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
constitutional
balance
with
regard
to
expenditures;
that
the
question
is
how
those
expenditures
affect
the
process.
and
in
that
sense,
i
think
that
there
is
a
balancing
test
there,
rather
than
full
protection
under
the
constitution
for
any
expenditure
of
any
kind.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that's
implicit
in
both.
the
berkeley
case,
we
refer
to
it
as
carc.
it's
the
citizens
against
rent
control
versus
berkeley.
i
think
in
both
those
cases,
i
think
the
court
dealt
with
the
analysis
as
the
question
was
one
of
the
governmental
interest
balance.
i
would
return
to
the
fact
that--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--yes,
because
i
think
that
the
608(e)
statute
that
was
considered
there
ran
the
entire
gamut.
it
covered
individuals,
groups,
political
committees,
all
kinds
of
associations.
dealt
with
by
this
statute
are
only
political
committees,
political
committees
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
ones
whose
business
is
influencing
federal
elections
and
who
receive
contributions.
it
is
a
much
narrower
focus
of
the
statute
than
was
present
in
the
statute
in
buckley.
the
second
point
that
i
would
want
to
make
is
that
in
this
broad
debate
there
was
considerable
concern
expressed
by
congress,
that
is
that
is
enshrined
in
the
statute,
which
was
noted
in
buckley
versus
valeo,
allowing
for
individual
and
group
speech
and
associational
rights
to
come
forward
in
the
political
process.
they
have
been
listed.
i
don't
want
to
run
through
them
all,
but
there
are
very
significant
ones.
first
of
all,
under
this
very
statute
individuals
are
not
limited
in
their
expenditures.
appellees
argue
that
this
makes
the
statute
discriminatory.
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
contrary,
what
it
shows
is
that
congress
was
very
sensitive
to
the
balance
it
was
making,
and
in
a
constitution
whose
basic
protections
are
for
individual
rights,
while
you
have
a
question
of
whether
those
individual
rights
to
associate
and
to
operate
through
a
group
have
been
curtailed
by
the
statute,
nonetheless
the
very
protection
of
individuals
to
spend
is
of
great
importance.
there
are
also
protections
in
the
statute
for
volunteer
activities,
for
expenditures
toward
political
meetings
and
groupings.
there
was
a
tremendous
in
congress
that
this
balance
that
it
felt
it
was
striking...
and
again,
i
refer
to
the
fact--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
think
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
referred
to,
and
i
would
say
that
there
certainly
is
the
ability
to
join
in
political
associations.
again,
there
was
great
discussion--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--the
right--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--well,
i
think
again
the
question
of
whether
the
limit
is
drawn
too
low
is
essentially
a
legislative
one,
but
that
the
question
of
whether
that
can
be
limited
again
is
a
question
that
was
dealt
with
in
the
contributions
area.
i
agree
that
one
of
the
rights
left
there
is
to
contribute
and
to
participate
in
political
associations.
again,
this
statute
does
nothing
to
curtail
issue
discussion.
we
have
a
long
discussion
in
the
common
cause
versus
schmitt,
and
there
are
questions
as
to
when
an
issue
group
might
move
over
to
being
one
that
was
seeking
to
support
a
candidate.
but
centrally
the
statute
does
not
deal...
it
deals
only
with
the
political
committees,
of
which
there
are
some
8,000
presently,
of
which
about
4,000
are
political
committees
of
candidates
and
parties.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
the
interpretation...
there
is
a
provision
in
the
statute
protecting
the
press
right.
it
seems
to
me
and
it
seems
to
the
commission
that
that
is
a
functional
analysis
of
whether
or
not
that
is
a
regular
periodical.
but
yes...
and
also,
again
in
the
statute,
in
the
441(b)
area,
internal
communications
are
not
at
all
limited
so
it
does
seem
to
me
that
those
are
areas
which
congress
has
exempted
out.
it
has
treated
the
press
differently.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
it
would
depend
upon
the
question
of
how
periodical
it
was,
but
i
think
that
a
periodical
appearing
before
the
election
that
was
a
broadside
would
be
held
not
to
be
within
the
protection
of
that
section.
but
that
would
be
a
statutory
interpretation
problem
with
regard
to
431(f)(4)(b),
i
guess
is
the
section.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
yes.
i
think
the
general
proposition
still
holds
true.
i
think--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
think
the
general
proposition
still
holds
true.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
the
general
proposition
still
holds
true.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well,
when
i
say
that
the
general
proposition
holds
true,
i
think
that
this
court
has
said
in
various
cases
that
if
it
saw
that
the...
took
as
the
motive
of
congress
to
stop
the
speech,
as
opposed
to
limiting
the
amounts
of
expenditures
in
elections,
that
that
would
go
to
the
question
of
the
motive
of
congress.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
it
would
curtail
the
expression
of
the
political
committees
down
to
nil
for
all
practical
purposes,
yes.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
that
would
be
a
different
statute
than
is
here.
congress
debated
the
$1,000
limit.
more
would
have
opened
it
up.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
would
like
first
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
the
statutory
interpretation.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
reply
briefs
in
footnotes
2
and
3
where
we
think
that
that
was
dealt
with
by
appellees
in
the
court
below.
it
seems
to
us
that
they
effectively
conceded
that
the
statute
covers
their
expenditures,
not
only
in
their
papers
to
the
district
court
below,
but
in
their
answer
to
the
complaint,
which
stated
that
the
expenditures
they
would
make...
it
was
also
their
statement
in
the
advisory
opinion
request
that
they
sought
from
the
commission.
with
regard
to
the
point
relating
to
the
statutory
history
and
to
the
intention
of
congress,
again
our
reply
brief
sets
forth
at
some
length,
as
well
as
our
opening
brief
does,
the
discussions
that
were
held
in
congress.
it
seems
very
clear
to
me
that,
first
of
all,
the
term
"independent
expenditures"
was
used.
i
would
note
that
608(e),
but
that
that
was
clearly
the
import
of
what
this
court
dealt
with
in
buckley
versus
valeo,
608(e)
having
been
the
broad
expenditure
limit
that
was
struck
down
by
this
court.
but
the
discussion
in
congress
related
to
the
question
of
private
money.
there
was
considerable
discussion
about
contributions.
there
was
considerable
discussions
about
expenditures.
so
that
the
concept
that
congress
did
not
understand
that
these
kinds
of
expenditures
would
come
forth
in
a
publicly
financed
system,
one
where
there
was
an
expenditure
limitation
on
the
candidate,
expenditure
limitations
on
his
party,
prohibition
of
private
contributions
to
the
candidate,
limitations
of
contributions
to
the
party,
seems
to
me
one
that
is
totally
at
odds
with
the
nature
of
congress
as
experts
who
know
a
great
deal
about
campaign
financing,
who
discussed
it.
senator
gore
in
1967,
when
he
raised
the
whole
question
about
the
efficacy
of
the
long
act
and
said,
rejecting
one
of
the
arguments
that
i
think
is
made
in
favor
of
what
this
statute
could
have
been,
said
about
the
long
act:
well,
that
will
only
be
a
subsidy,
listed
explicitly
nine
points.
the
second
of
those
nine
points
was
precisely
that
expenditures
would
be
made
by
unauthorized
committees.
the
whole
debate
that
led
to
the
honest
elections
act
of
1967
that
was
reported
out
was
dealing
with
the
question
of
how
do
we
deal
with
unaccountable
expenditures?
it
was
the
form
of
the
complaint
that
was
made
against
the
statute
as
it
had
passed
in
1966,
and
that
was
the
statute
that
was
carried
forth
to
1971.
finally,
i
would
say
that,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
everything
is
a
code
word
for
effectiveness,
i
think
that
it
is
indeed
true
that
what
congress
was
aiming
at
in
section
9012(f)
was
committees
who
would
be
able
to
conduct
the
kind
of
national
campaign
that
cost
millions
of
dollars.
there
is
no
question
that
what
it
sought
to
prohibit
was
political
committees,
precisely
because
they
were
able
to
do
that.
that
does
not
mean
to
me,
and
i
should
think
that
it
would
not
mean
to
this
court,
that
what
congress
was
there
intending
to
do
was
to
cut
off
the
individual's
rights
of
speech
and
association.
individuals
are
protected
in
their
volunteer
activities.
they're
protected
under
the
statute
here
in
terms
of
making
expenditures.
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
in
which
congress
has
dealt
with
that.
so
that
the
answer
with
regard
to
the
effectiveness
is,
yes,
precisely
the
reason
that
congress
saw
these
independent
committees,
who
could
not
be
found
to
be
not
independent
in
the
course
of
the
election,
the
danger
that
it--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--local
radio.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
local
radio,
one
of
the
things
set
forth--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--the
record
has
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
was
put
in
precisely
with
regard
to
that
point.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
it's
referred
to
in
our
brief
in
the
summation,
but
the
printed
appendix...
not
only
in
the
record,
it
was
printed
in
the
appendix,
and
it's
in
the
stipulation
of
facts
as
to
the
amount
of
advertising
that
an
individual
by
himself
could
buy.
and
as
we
have
said
in
the
brief
and
with
regard
to
the
discussion
about
the
taft
amendment,
we
don't
think
that
the
reach
of
the
statute...
the
reach
of
the
statute
is
against
political
committees,
not
against
groups
of
individuals
pooling
their
funds,
so
that
you
have
on
top
of
the
ads
that
you
could
get
in
the
local
newspaper
or
on
the
local
radio
station
or
even
the
local
tv
station--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--very
small,
if
they'd
take
it.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
no
question.
again,
i
think
that
was
the
precise
balance
that
congress
was
really
concerned
about
in
all
of
these
debates,
was
how
to
get
a
handle
on
limiting
the
large
aggregations
of
wealth
that
came
into
political
committees
and
the
expenditure
of
those,
without
interfering
with
the
rights
of
individuals,
small
groups.
a
long
discussion
about
the
pastore
amendment,
about
groups
of
columbia
university
professors.
i've
never
known
why
they
chose
that
as
the
hypothetical.
but
that
was
the
precise
balance
that
congress
was
trying
to
make,
how
to
reach
the
aggregations
through
political
committees,
but
not
interfere
with
the
individuals'
and
small
groups'
rights
to
have
some
influence.
it
would
not
be
sufficient
to
mount
a
national
campaign,
but
it
was
precise
those
shadow
campaigns,
as
we
have
spoken
of
them,
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
if
you
don't
limit
unauthorized
political
committees
in
their
expenditures,
congress
felt
you
would
have
those
kinds
of
campaigns.
and
as
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
again
as
is
mentioned,
that
seems
to
have
come
true.
here
you
have
a
statute
that
prohibits
it,
that
the
commission
has
said
has
prohibited
these
activities
for
a
long
time.
it's
been
challenged
by
appellees.
they
have
mounted
major
campaigns.
if
there
was
not
that
prohibition,
some
8,000
political
committees
could
do
the
same
thing.
the
size
of
that
is
considerably
larger
than
the
public
fund,
whatever
the
public
fund.
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
we
did
put
into
the
record
attempts
to
show
what
an
individual
could
buy
in
terms
of
local
advertising.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
it
can.
i
would
say
that,
with
regard
to
minor
party
candidates...
major
party
candidates
are
dealt
with
very
differently
in
the
fund
act
than
minor
party
candidates.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that,
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
situation
that
would
make
the
court
go
behind
it.
but
given
the
hypothetical,
i
think,
yes,
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
look
behind
it
to
find
that
the
purpose
of
that
campaign
was
to
further
the
election
of
one
of
the
major
party
candidates.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
an
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
that's
involved
in
this
section,
section
9012(f).
again,
as
i
say,
i
think
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
instance,
because
it
would
be
in
effect
a
non-bona
fide
candidate
for
president.
but
if
that
was
the
purpose,
i
think
that
the
purpose
question
would
come
to
focus
on
section
9012(f),
which
is
the
statute
before
you.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
no,
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
i
don't
think
that
there
are
difficulties
involved
in
that.
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
the
commission
has
had
to
wrestle
with
in
the
advisory
opinion
process,
because
of
the
prospects
after
1980
and
coming
into
1984
for
the
fact
that
there
might
be
third
party
candidates
who
were
publicly
financed,
was
the
implications
of
those.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
as
always,
in
the
short
space
of
the
general
election,
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
would
see
this
as
a
statute
is
that
it's
very
difficult
for
the
commission
to
get
at
that
in
the
space
before
the
election.
