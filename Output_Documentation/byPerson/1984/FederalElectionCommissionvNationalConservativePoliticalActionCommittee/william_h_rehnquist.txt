justice
rehnquist
i
have
one
question,
mr.
steele.
is
your
argument
diminished
at
all
in
its
force
by
the
fact
that
the
fec
brought
a
suit
on
its
own
in
this
case?
justice
rehnquist
from
the
corrosive
effects
of
public
financing?
justice
rehnquist
couldn't
congress
have
achieved
pretty
much
the
same
result
here
without
limiting
the
speech
of
third
parties
by
saying
that,
where
this
contributing
takes
place
by
a
private
group
that
appears
to
be
coordinated,
that
the
candidate
will
lose
so
much
of
the
public
financing
as
is
represented
by
the
coordinated
expenditures?
justice
rehnquist
well,
my
thought
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
i
think
congress
would
have
been
on
a
stronger
footing
so
far
as
the
first
amendment
is
concerned
where
it
says,
we're
going
to
deduct
some
of
the
money
we're
giving
you,
to
the
candidate,
where
you're
just
dealing
with
the
government
handing
out
money,
rather
than
saying,
we're
going
to
forbid
you
from
making
a
certain
kind
of
expenditures
for
speech.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
right
to
work
committee
decision
of
the
court
a
couple
years
ago,
which
did
deal
with
the
prohibition
against
corporations
and
unions,
that
case
went
off
on
the
proposition
that
corporations
have
always
been
treated
differently
for
purposes
of
political
expenditures
since
way,
way
back
than
individuals
have.
i
don't
see
how
that
supports
anything
about
what
a
political
committee
can
do.
justice
rehnquist
well,
to
the
extent
you're
dealing
with
the
corporate
form,
you
can
probably
get
them
under
the
section
involved
in
nrwc,
can't
you?
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
none
of
the
arguments,
at
least
in
reading
judge
becker's
opinion
in
the
district
court,
suggest
that
all
of
these
defendants
were
corporations
and
that
they
should
be
subjected
to
the
corporate
restrictions
in
the
act.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
judge
pecker
distinguished
nrwc
in
his
opinion
on
the
ground
that
it
dealt
with
corporations.
so
it
strikes
me
that
this
argument
at
least
wasn't
made
to
his
court.
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that...
why
is
one
to
be
preferred
over
another
for
first
amendment
purposes?
justice
rehnquist
a
lot
of
that
line
of
analysis
was
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
buckley
against
valeo,
and
squarely
rejected
by
this
court...
the
idea
that
you
enhance
first
amendment
values
by
subduing
some
people's
speech
and
increasing
other
people's
speech.
justice
rehnquist
isn't
it
possible
to
at
least
infer
from
the
debates
that
congress
was
concerned
about
corruption
when
it
passed
9012(f)?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
the
appearance
of
corruption
is
a
valid
purpose,
something
against
which
congress
may
legislate,
why
can't
the
appearance
of
corruption
be
determined
by
a
plebiscite?
you
can
argue,
it
seems
to
me,
that
perhaps
the
appearance
of
corruption
is
something
which
is
not
as
high
on
the
scale
of
constitutional
values
as
corruption
itself,
but
if
you
concede
that
the
appearance
of
corruption
is
something
against
which
congress
can
legislate,
why
shouldn't
the
appearance
of
corruption
be
proveable
by
a
poll?
justice
rehnquist
like
testimony
from
a
pollster?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you
concede
that
the
statutory
construction
argument
is
resolved
against
you,
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
and
say
that
congress
did
go
further
here,
i
think
you
have
to
admit
that
congress
thought
it
was
necessary
to
go
further
than
the
other
means
that
you
say
you
think
are
perfectly
adequate.
justice
rehnquist
no,
all
i
meant
was
that
when
you
argue
about
the
extent
of
the
statute
here
and
going
further
than
necessary,
you
necessarily
assume
that
the
statutory
construction
argument
is
resolved
differently
than
you
say
it
should
be.
