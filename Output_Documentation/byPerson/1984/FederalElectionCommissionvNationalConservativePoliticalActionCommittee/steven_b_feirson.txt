mr.
steven
b.
feirson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
respect
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
just
posed
abort
the
dollar
limitations,
it
might
be
well
to
remember
that
in
a
somewhat
analogous
provision
of
the
federal
election
laws,
section
441(b),
the
congress
applied
an
absolute
prohibition
upon
corporations
and
unions
on
expending
any
amount
of
money
in
independent
expenditures
to
further
the
election
of
candidates
for
federal
office.
and
i
think
that
particular
provision
is
very
helpful
in
trying
to
analyze
this--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
if
you
go
back
and
look
through
the
nrwc
case,
the
rationale
for
why
corporations
have
always
been
treated
differently
is
their
ability
to
aggregate
wealth
and
to
use
the
corporate
form.
in
fact
here,
when
we
deal
with
these
particular
appellees,
we
are
also
dealing
with
the
corporate
form
and
all
the
incidents
that
goes
with
it.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
no,
because
that
section
does
not...
would
not
pertain
here,
inasmuch
as
under
a
federal
election
commission
regulation
they
have
registered
as
a
political
committee
and
thereby
have
taken
themselves
out
from
underneath
441(b).
so
in
essence
the
only
difference
here
between
the
appellees
in
this
case
and
nrwc,
and
that
case,
is
that
nrwc
failed
to
register
under
the
particular
provision,
the
particular
regulation
of
the
federal
election
commission
that
would
have
taken
it
out
from
underneath
441(b).
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
both
of
the
appellees
are
corporations.
they
are
corporations
almost
identical
to
nrwc.
that
is,
they
are
nonprofit
corporations,
they
do
not
have
any
members.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct.
the
argument
on
nrwc
and
the
fact
that
you
cannot
distinguish
the
corporate
form
of
nrwc
and
the
corporate
form
of
the
appellees
was
indeed
made
to
the
district
court.
i
think
what
judge
becker
was
saying
in
attempting
to
distinguish
nrwc
was,
it
is
a
different
case
for
the
following
reason:
he
said
that
in
corporations,
when
you're
dealing
with
corporations,
you're
dealing
with
an
economic
entity
rather
than
an
ideological
entity,
and
that
was
the
basis
of
his
distinction.
i
think
that's
a
faulty
basis,
because
nrwc
is
not
an
economic
entity,
it
is
an
ideological
entity,
similar
to
the
appellees,
which
has
in
fact
the
same
purpose
as
the
appellees,
which
is
to
attempt
to
influence
federal
elections.
my
basic
point
is
that
if
you
look
at
what
nrwc
was
as
an
entity,
their
corporate
form,
how
they
were
structured,
and
you
look
at
the
441(b)
prohibition,
which
is
absolute,
it
is
very
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
find
any
distinction
between
that
case
and
that
particular
party
and
these
particular
appellees.
they
are
all
corporations,
they
are
all
nonprofit
corporations,
they
are
all
ideological
corporations.
none
of
those
three
parties
have
any
input
at
all
from
their
contributors
as
to
how
they
are
run
or
how
they
are
managed
or
how
the
expenditures
are
made.
so
in
the
441(b)
situation
which
was
present
in
nrwc,
this
court
unanimously
upheld
a
total
prohibition
on
independent
expenditures.
what
we
have
in
the
fund
act
is
a
somewhat
less
restrictive
limitation,
in
that
it
does
permit
the
$1,000
spending
limit.
and
we
would
urge
the
court
to
closely
look
at
the
441(b)
and
the
nrwc
analogy
to
see
if
there
are
any
distinctions
of
constitutional
dimension.
there
are
always
some
distinctions,
but
we
would
argue
that
there
are
very,
very
few,
if
any;
in
fact,
there
are
no
distinctions
of
constitutional
dimension.
earlier
questions
focused
on
the
difference
between
coordinated
expenditures
and
independent
expenditures.
part
of
the
problem
with
that
in
this
setting...
and
i
think
it's
a
problem
that
the
congress
recognized...
was
that
it
is
virtually
impossible
in
the
space
of
an
election
campaign...
that
is,
from
the
time
the
candidates
are
nominated
until
the
time
the
election
is
held...
for
the
federal
election
commission
or
any
other
decisionmaking
body
to
determine
what
is
and
is
not
a
coordinated
expenditure.
for
example,
with
respect
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
a
different
type
of
statutory
scheme
where
the
candidates'
dollar
totals
would
go
down
if
coordinated
expenditures
were
made.
well,
if
you
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
candidate,
it's
an
impossible
choice.
if
you
say
to
a
candidate,
you'll
have
$40
million
unless
at
some
time
later
somebody
decides
that
somebody
made
a
coordinated
expenditure,
the
candidate's
going
to
say,
no,
thank
you.
that
is
just
a
practical
reality.
if
the
public
funding
scheme
is
going
to
work,
if
candidates
are
going
to
accept
public
funding,
which
every
single
major
party
presidential
candidate
has
done
since
it
went
into
effect,
there
must
be
a
certainty.
there
must
be
a
certainty
that
they
will
get
the
full
grant
that's
coming
to
them.
otherwise
they're
going
to
have
to
turn
it
down
and
say,
i'll
take
my
chances
getting
private
contributions.
and
so
as
soon
as
you
start
to
focus
too
much
on
the
distinction
between
independent
and
coordinated
expenditures,
you
get
into,
i
think,
a
can
of
worms,
because
those
are
very
difficult
decision,
they're
very
fact-oriented,
and
there's
no
way
at
all
that
they
can
be
made
within
the
space
of
the
campaign.
i
think
it's
also
important
in
considering
how
9012
interacts
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
fund
act
to
remember
that
as
a
whole
the
fund
act,
as
this
court
found
in
buckley,
enhances
pertinent
first
amendment
valves
by
releasing
candidates
from
the
rigors
of
fund-raising.
in
other
words,
it
does
two
things:
it
gives
candidates
more
time
to
discuss
issues
that
are
important
to
the
country,
rather
than
trying
to
raise
funds;
and
in
addition,
it
enables
the
candidates
to
in
theory
discuss
those
issues
in
a
more
open
and
free-flowing
fashion
and
not
worry
about
how
it
might
affect
potential
financing
support.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
i
don't
suggest
for
a
second
that
one
is
to
be
preferred
over
the
other
for
first
amendment
purposes.
what
i
suggest
is
there
has
to
be
a
balance
between
the
two,
and
that
this
is
not
a
black
and
white
situation
where
the
appellees
come
in
and
say,
our
first
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
and
unless
you
show
me
some
compelling
governmental
interest
you're
going
to
lose.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
before
you
even
get
to
the
compelling
governmental
interest,
this
court
ought
to
take
into
consideration
what
are
competing
and
countervailing
first
amendment
values.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
well,
i
think
in
that
case
what
the
court
was
focusing
on,
what
this
court
focused
on,
was
the
subduing
of
the
speech
of
the
rich
versus
the
poor
or
easterners
versus
westerners.
what
we
have
here
is
a
mutual
provision.
it's
not
liberal
or
conservative,
it's
not
east
or
west,
north
or
south.
it
goes
to
a
particular
type
of
organism,
a
particular
type
of
organization,
like
a
corporation,
like
a
labor
union.
it
is
an
organism
that
aggregates
wealth,
like
a
corporation,
like
a
labor
union.
and
this
court
in
nrwc
said
that
it
was
within
the
congress'
discretion
to
make
a
determination
that
organizations
like
corporations,
labor
unions,
or,
i
believe
the
quote
is,
"other
similar
organizations"
are
worthy
of
this
type
of
regulation.
and
we
would
submit
that
this
is...
that
the
appellees
are
other
similar
types
of
organizations.
they
aggregate
funds
and
they
spend
money
which
is
not
theirs.
and
9012(f)
does
not
attempt
to
regulate
the
expenditure
of
funds
by
individuals,
that
is,
when
they
are
spending
their
own
money.
it
does
not
attempt
to
regulate
the
expenditure
of
funds
by
groups;
that
is,
when
groups
of
people
actually
band
together,
pool
their
money
and
spend
it.
all
9012(f)
attempts
to
regulate
is
an
organism
which
accumulates
funds
from
contributors,
and
when
those
contributors
have
no
control
or
say
over
how
those
funds
are
spent
then
you
have
a
political
committee.
and
it
is
only
in
that
circumstance
that
9012(f)
would
apply.
and
i
think
it's
a
very
different
situation
than
buckley,
where
you
had
an
across
the
board
type
of
prohibition.
with
respect
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
whether
or
not,
if
you
have
a
$1,000
limitation,
does
that
make
the
small
contributor's
contribution
rights
hollow,
i
don't
think
it
does.
and
the
reason
is
i
think
you
have
to
focus
on
what
is
the
speech
right
of
the
contributor.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
and
i
think
that
that
was
true
in
buckley.
we
would
submit
it
is
not
true
here.
there
can
be
no
pooling
here,
because
the
record
is
undisputed
that
the
contributor,
once
the
money
goes
in,
has
absolutely
no
say
over
how
that
money
is
spent
or
even
if
it
is
spent.
when
these
appellees...
and
the
record
is
undisputed
on
this...
send
out
solicitations
saying,
send
us
so
many
dollars
for
such-and-such
a
presidential
candidate--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--well,
the
point
would
be
that
if
the
committees
required
significant
participation
then
it
would
be
likely
to
come
out
from
underneath
the
definition,
because
it
would
be
more
like
a--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--that's
correct.
thank
you.
