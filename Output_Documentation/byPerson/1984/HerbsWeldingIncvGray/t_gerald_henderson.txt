mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
robert
gray
was
injured,
as
has
been
noted,
on
a
fixed
gas
and
oil
production
platform
located
in
the
bay
marshan
field,
which
is
divided
by
the
three-mile
line
separating
louisiana
territorial
waters
from
the
ocs
waters.
gray
estimated
that
approximately
25
percent
of
his
work
in
the
year
preceding
the
accident
had
been
conducted
on
the
ocs,
and
a
review
of
the
map
which
was
entered
into
evidence
before
the
administrative
proceeding
indicated
that
the
platform
field
is
an
interrelated
field
with
gas
operations
covering
waters
that
otherwise
are
not
distinguished
at
all
except
for
the
line
that
runs
through
that.
in
that
regard,
i
think
some
of
the
figures
that
were
given
by
mr.
brown
this
morning,
the
number
of
workers,
20,000
workers,
60,000
nationwide,
i
would
imagine
that
those
aren't
workers
that
are
strictly
in
state
waters.
those
are
workers
who
work
offshore.
and
i
would
imagine
that
the
overwhelming
number
of
them
are
already
covered
under
the
longshoremen's
act
pursuant
to
the
ocsla
provisions.
the
workers
also,
like
gray,
are
moving
in
and
out
of
coverage
in
these
waters.
gray
could
be
on
the
ocs
as
easily
as
he
could
be
in
state
territorial
waters.
it
has
also
been
noted
that
gray
would
have
been
covered
had
he
been
on
the
ocs
through
the
extension
act,
that
he
would
have
been
covered
on
transit
through
the
oilfields,
and
that
had
he
had
work
on
a
movable
rig,
he
would
have
been
covered.
but
because
of
the
combination
of
the
injury
in
territorial
waters
and
the
fixed
platform
situs,
the
issue
becomes
a
question
about
whether
gray
is
entitled
to
longshoremen's
benefits.
in
looking
at
status,
it
is
necessary
to
examine
the
nature
and
purpose
of
gray's
activities,
whether
those
activities
have
a
significant
connection
to
maritime
navigation
or
commerce,
and
whether
the
purpose
of
the
activities
was
to
facilitate
maritime
commerce.
in
caputo,
the
court
noted
that
with
respect
to
landward
extension
the
language
of
the
'72
amendments
is
broad,
and
suggests
that
the
court
should
take
an
expansive
view
of
the
extended
coverage,
as
well
as
the
focus
on
maritime
connected
nature
and
purpose
of
the
job
rather
than
the
location
also
serves
this
particular
purpose.
focusing
on
gray's
work,
the
map
introduced
in
evidence
during
the
administrative
proceedings
depicts
the
number
of
platforms
existing
in
both
state
and
ocs
waters,
and
gray
was
responsible
for
welding
maintenance
work
on
all
these
platforms,
and
was
required
daily
to
travel
among
them
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
on
some
days,
he
would
have
to
travel
to
perhaps
two
or
three
or
four
platforms,
and
on
other
days
he
would
have
work
duties
on,
for
example,
like
the
e
structure
of
the
platform
where
he
was
hurt.
he
was
on
that
for
approximately
three
or
four
days.
but
in
any
event,
he
would
have
to
be
transported
back
to
the
m
structure,
the
mike
structure,
where
he
was
housed
daily.
in
addition
to
the
regular
and
recurring
travel
by
boat,
gray
was
required
to
board
the
structures,
load
and
unload
his
equipment.
his
work
records
document
repair
work
that
he
did
on
swing
ropes,
which
is
the
method
by
which
one
gets
from
a
crew
boat
onto
the
structure.
he
did
repair
work
on
boat
bumpers,
life
raft
launches,
cranes,
and
decking.
but
primarily
he
was
responsible
for
maintaining
and
repairing
and
installing
oil
and
gas
lines
connecting
the
bay
marshan
field.
as
noted
by
the
court
below,
the
maintenance
of
these
lines
is
vital
to
the
drilling
and
removal
of
gas
and
oil,
and
offshore
oil
and
gas
activity
should
be
construed
as
maritime
commerce
because
of
its
primary
relationship
with
the
sea.
it
takes
place
on
structures
located
in
the
sea.
it
involves
transportation
across
water.
and
it
of
course
poses
hazards
which
are
complicated
by
the
maritime
location.
certainly
gray
meets
this
test
because
his
work
activity
is
involved
in
each
one
of
those
requirements.
the
test
as
formulated
by
the
fifth
circuit
for
land-based
workers,
drawing
on
the
earlier
second
circuit
case,
is
whether
the
work
bore
a
realistically
significant
relationship
to
traditional
maritime
activity
involving
navigation
and
commerce
on
navigable
waters.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
under
ocsla
they
brought
coverage
to
the
ocs
worker.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
yes,
i
think
he
would.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
that
was
in
1953.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
ocsla
was
passed
in
1953,
bringing
coverage--
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
--to
the
offshore
oil
worker.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
my
client
would
not
have
been
covered.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
not
at
the
time
of
that
particular
injury.
he
may
have
had
coverage--
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
--oh,
on
the
oc...
if
he--
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
--you
are
saying
he
is
injured
on
the
ocs
without
ocsla?
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
there
would
be--
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
--well,
yes,
but
given
the
case
of
rodrigue,
if
he
were
injured
on
the
platform,
he
wouldn't
be
covered,
but
for
the--
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
--which
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
no,
your
honor.
the...
and
i
wanted
to
get
to
rodrigue
for
a
minute.
rodrigue
dealt
with
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
without
the
provisions
of
ocsla--
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
--he
would
not
have.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
rodrigue--
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
--if
he
were
injured
on
the
fixed
platform,
that's
correct,
without
the
exception
of
ocsla.
the
rodrigue
case
is
not
a
maritime
labor
case,
as
has
been
argued
here
this
morning.
it
is
no
different.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
mention
of
labor
in
that
particular
case.
it
was
not
in
consideration
of
the
kinds
of
maritime
employment.
of
course,
it
was
decided
in
1969,
prior
to
the
1972
amendments.
the
rodrigue
case
simply
held
that
platforms
were
not
vessels,
and
there
was
no
discussion
about
what
maritime
employment
was,
but
the
argument
that
is
brought
here
this
morning
is
that
because
it
occurred
on
a
platform,
hence
it
is
not
maritime
employment,
and
i
think
what
the
petitioner
does
is
the
same
theory
that
was
brought
before
the
court
by
the
employer
in
pfeiffer
versus
ford,
where
the
employer
attempted
to
build
in
another
status
or
situs
test
on
the
issue
of
status,
that
is,
whether
there
would
be
further
geographical
limitations
in
your
consideration
of
whether
an
employee
had
status.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
on
the
situs
requirement?
i
think
he
has
to
meet
the
situs
requirement.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
he
has
to
be
injured
on
an
area--
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
--customarily
used
for
loading
and
unloading
a
vessel.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
it
is
done
by
pipes.
that's
correct.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
evidence
in
this
case
of
that.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
this
area
is
customarily
used
in
loading
and
unloading
crews,
supplies,
and
oil
from
the
crew
boat
to
the
platform.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
no.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
well,
he
was.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
he
was
loading
and
unloading
his
equipment
in
and
out
of
the
crew
boat.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
not
when
the
accident
occurred.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
on
a
gas
line.
mr.
t.
gerald
henderson
that
is
correct.
thank
you.
