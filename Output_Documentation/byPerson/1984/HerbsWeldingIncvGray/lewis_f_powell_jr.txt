justice
jr.
the
respondent
here
has
recovered
under
the
louisiana
workmens
compensation
act,
has
he?
justice
jr.
what
is
the
amount
of
that
recovery,
or
what
is
the
nature
of
it,
in
the
first
place?
justice
jr.
i
ought
to
know
the
answer
to
my
next
question,
but
i
don't
recall
it.
if
respondent
wins
this
case,
would
he
be
entitled
to
return
to
louisiana
what
it
has
paid
him,
and
what
it
will
in
the
future?
justice
jr.
would
there
be
a
double
recovery?
justice
jr.
what
would
happen?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
you,
are
there
any
words,
any
language
in
the
1972
amendment
that
supports
your
position?
justice
jr.
which
specific
words?
justice
jr.
is
there
anything
specific
in
the
legislative
history
relating
to
offshore
platforms?
justice
jr.
do
you
think
it
was
just
sort
of
oversight
that
there
was
no
mention
made
of
workers
in
this
category,
even
though
there
were
apparently
20,000?
justice
jr.
is
it
fair
to
say
that
your
argument
is
based
on
broad
principles
of
common
sense
rather
than
any
specific
language
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
statute?
