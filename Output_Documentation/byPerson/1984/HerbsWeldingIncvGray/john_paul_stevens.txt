justice
stevens
mr.
brown,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
thinking
on
the
case.
justice
stevens
you
are
primarily
arguing
status
rather
than
situs--
justice
stevens
--if
i
understand
your
dialogue
with
justice
white,
and
do
i
also
understand
that
you
would
not
think
your
case
would...
your
situs
case,
you
would
also
take
the
same
general
position
if
this
man
never
went
out
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
but
he
was
always
within
state
waters.
would
you
still
not
argue
situs
very
forcefully?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
yes,
i
see.
i
understand.
but
you
would...
in
other
words,
his
situs
would
be,
he
would
satisfy
the
situs
test
even
if
he
didn't
occasionally
or
about
half
the
time--
justice
stevens
--yes,
okay.
thank
you.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
you
mentioned
the
new
statute
that
was
just
passed
does
change
one
of
our
decisions
and
there
may
be
a
question
of
its
retroactivity.
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
decision?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
0....
justice
stevens
ms.
corwin,
may
i
ask,
your
opponent
suggests,
and
i
think
he
is
probably
right
on
this,
that
even
under
your
view
you
will
still
have
a
problem
of
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage.
it
is
just
that
the
boundary
has
moved
farther
landward.
justice
stevens
because
there
are
a
lot
of
welders
who
do
some
welding
on
shorebased
oil
wells,
and
some
who
do
them
out
on
these
rigs,
and
aren't
they
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage?
justice
stevens
mr.
henderson,
could
i
ask
this
question?
this
case
is
kind
of
like
a
jigsaw
puzzle.
but
supposing
congress
had
never
enacted
ocsla.
would
your
case
be
exactly
the
same?
did
they
accomplish
anything
at
all
insofar
as
coverage
under
the
longshoremen's
act
is
concerned
by
ocsla?
justice
stevens
but
wouldn't
he
have
been
covered
anyway
under
your
approach
to
the
case?
justice
stevens
so
really
they
were
wasting
their
time
when
they
enacted
that
statute?
yes,
but
ocsla
was
before.
justice
stevens
pardon
me?
that
was
before
the
'72
amendments.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
but
you
would...
do
you
agree
that
he
would
not
have
been
covered
prior
to
1972,
your
client?
justice
stevens
and
nobody
even
on
the--
justice
stevens
--supposing
we
were
talking
about
an
injury
to
a
person
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
doing
exactly
the
same
kind
of
work.
would
he
have
been
covered
before
1972?
yes.
apart
from
ocsla?
oh,
no.
justice
stevens
under
your
view.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
wouldn't
you
still
argue
there
was
a
substantial
relation
to
maritime
employment
and
all
the
rest
of
it?
justice
stevens
of
course,
rodrigue
didn't
construe
the
statute.
it
was
really
dealing
with
the
question
under
the
jones
act.
justice
stevens
well,
rodrigue
didn't
say
a
word
about
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act.
justice
stevens
right.
let
me
just
phrase
my
question
narrowly.
if...
under
your
view,
would
there
have
been,
apart
from
ocsla
and
all
other
statutes,
if
this
incident
had
occurred
before
1972
on
one
of
these
rigs
on
the
outer
shelf,
would
the
worker
have
had
coverage
under
the
longshoremen
act?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
okay.
thank
you.
