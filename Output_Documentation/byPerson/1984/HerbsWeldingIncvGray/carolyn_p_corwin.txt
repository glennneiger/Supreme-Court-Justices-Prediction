ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
1972
congress
expanded
the
coverage
of
the
longshoremens
act
so
that
it
would
encompass
more
than
injuries
that
took
place
on
actual
navigable
waters.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
perhaps
you
are
referring
to
the
status
requirement
that
was
imposed
in
connection
with
the
expansion
of
coverage.
i
think
the
court
established
at
least
to
a
considerable
extent
in
perini
that
there
was
no
intent
to
withdraw
coverage,
but
that
imposition
of
the
status
requirement
was
merely
a
way
to
limit
the
expansion
that
was...
that
took
place
under
the
situs
requirement.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
overall,
i
am
sure
that
is
the
case.
there
were
a
number
of
provisions
in
the
amendments.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
coverage,
there
were
a
lot
more
provisions
in
the
'72
amendments--
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
--i
would
suggest
not.
i
suggest
maybe
the
balance
was
struck
in
other
parts
of
the
statute,
and
that
you
shouldn't
be
concerned
about
striking
your
own
balance
here
in
that
respect.
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
in
expanding
the
coverage
meant
to
bring
within
the
act
the
sort
of
injury
suffered
by
mr.
gray
in
this
case.
that
is,
an
injury
to
an
offshore
oil
worker,
here
a
welder
who
happens
to
be
at
the
time
that
there
is
injury
on
a
fixed
platform
that
rests
in
waters
inside
the
three-mile
boundary.
now,
mr.
gray
is
the
sort
of
worker
who
would
have
been
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
prior
to
1972.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
he
would
have
for
several
reasons,
and
this
is
true
of
many
offshore
oil
workers.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
i
think
congress's
intent
in
expanding
the
coverage
was
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
amphibious
worker,
the
worker
who
is
sometimes--
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
--right,
sometimes
on
navigable
waters
in
the
course
of
his
employment,
sometimes
in
these
areas
adjoining
the
waters,
and
i
think
you
have
in
mr.
gray
a
prime
example
of
someone
like
that,
and
mr.
brown
himself
has
suggested
that
the
entire
offshore
oil
industry
involves
people
who
are
walking
in
and
out
of
different
working
situations,
different
locales,
different
sorts
of
structures.
so,
i
think
congress
was
faced
in
1972
with
a
number
of
these
sorts
of
situations,
and
it
wanted
to
provide
uniform
coverage
to
solve
that
sort
of
anomaly.
i
think
here
you
have
the
sort
of
employee
who
presents
precisely
that
anomaly.
now,
i
think,
justice
white,
you
asked
earlier
of
mr.
brown
about
the
situation
before
1972
for
this
particular
individual.
had
he
been
injured
on
a
fixed
platform
prior
to
1972,
it
appears
that
he
would
not
have
been
covered,
because
he
would
not
have
met
the
actual
navigable
waters
requirement
of
the
statute.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
even
if
he
had
been
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage.
that
was
the
problem
that
congress
faced.
it
just
appeared
that
there
was
this
very
strict
situs
requirement
under
the
pre-1972
statute,
so
there
was
this
problem
for
people
like
mr.
gray.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
is
so,
but
i
think
congress
was
concerned
about
the
sort
of--
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
--well,
there
was
not--
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
--well,
there
was
not
a
requirement
that
someone
be
in
maritime
employment
prior
to
1972.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
i--
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
--well,
i
don't
want
to
really
assume
anything,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
when
congress
spoke
of
maritime
employment
in
1972,
you
have
to
look
at
what
it
was
trying
to
accomplish,
and
you
have
to
look
at
kind
of
a
common
sense
understanding
of
what
they
would
have
meant.
i
don't
think
the
term
maritime
has
some
fixed
and
immutable
meaning.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
i
just
don't
think
there
was
some
immutable
definition
of
maritime
employment.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the--
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
--well,
before
1970--
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
--prior
to
1972,
the
term
maritime
employment
showed
up
only
in
the
definition
of
employer,
not
employee,
and
it
was
an
issue
the
courts
rarely
reached,
because
if
something
happened
on
navigable
waters,
it
almost
always
turned
out
to
be
maritime
in
nature.
but
i
am
suggesting
that
when
you
are
talking
about
the
term
maritime,
you
don't
necessarily
go
back
to
the
rodrigue
case
and
say
what
did
the
court
say
about
maritime
there.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
i
think
those
cases
simply
don't
relate
to
what
congress
was
talking
about
in
1972
when
it
amended
the
longshoremen's
act.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
what
congress
might
have
had
in
mind
at
that
point
in
terms
of
what
it
must
have
meant
by
maritime
employment.
now,
we
know
that
congress
was
interested
in
solving
this
sort
of
anomaly
of
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
in
1972.
the
language
that
congress
used
in
amending
the
statute
on
its
face
is
clearly
broad
enough
to
encompass
someone
in
mr.
gray's
situation,
and
we
suggest
that
even
if
it
weren't
crystal
clear
on
the
face,
that
the
language
ought
to
be
read
to
cover
a
situation
like
this
one
in
view
of
congress's
overarching
purpose
of
solving
this
anomaly
of
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well--
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
--well,
i
suppose
to
some
extent
you
can
never
completely
solve
the
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
problem,
because
coverage
determinations
under
compensation
systems
by
their
nature
are
always
going
to
have
these
fringe
areas.
i
think
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
1972
was
to
eliminate
at
least
some
of
that
anomaly
to
get
rid
of
these
rather
obvious
situations
of
the
amphibious
workers
who
in
the
course
of
their
employment
were
regularly
going
back
and
forth.
i
am
sure
that
congress
knew
that
it
couldn't
precisely
solve
every
last
limit
on
this
issue,
but
i
think
the
intent
was
to
go
after
this
sort
of
anomaly
to
the
extent
they
could
do
something
practical
about
it.
now,
justice
o'connor,
you
had
raised
the
1974
amendments,
the
ones
that
were
signed
by
the
president
on
friday,
i
believe.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
excuse
me,
the
1984
amendments.
they
don't
address
this
case.
congress
did
suggest
it
realized
that
in
using
the
term
maritime
employment
in
1972
it
had
created
some
problems
that
had
generated
litigation.
it
enacted
some
exemptions
to
the
maritime
employment
definition,
things
it
said
it
really
didn't
consider
to
be
maritime.
it
did
not
address
the
offshore
oil
industry.
there
was
a
proposal
to
reverse
the
thornton
decision,
the
fifth
circuit
decision
about
fabrication
on
land
of
these
offshore
platforms.
ultimately
that
was
not
enacted,
so
there
is
nothing
in
the
bill.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
i
don't...
i
think
that
there
is
a
pretty
consistent
line
of
cases
that
deals
with
marine
construction
workers
and
finds
that
to
be
within
the
maritme
area,
but...
but
i
really
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case.
i
think
that
what
you
have
got--
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well
that...
that's
so,
although
i
think
then
you
get
into
the
question
of
whether
they
have
correctly
applied
the
substantial
relationship
test,
and
i
think
clearly
as
to
the
body
of
offshore
oil
workers
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case,
there's
really
no
question
that
they
have
properly
applied
that
test.
but
i
don't
think
the
'84
amendments
really
tell
you
much
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
case
we
have
here.
now
this
court
has
recognized
that
congress
in
1972
clearly
intended
to
end
this
anomaly
of
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
with
respect
to
longshoremen
and
ship
repair
types,
the
people
who
are
the
more
familiar
sort
of
employees
covered
by
the
act,
but
there
were
always
other
employees
covered
by
the
act,
including
people
like,
of
course,
the
construction
worker
in
perini,
including
people
like
mr.
gray,
who
by
necessity
is
on
water
part
of
the
time
as
a
regular
part
of
his
employment.
it
is
of
necessity
in
the
offshore
oil
industry
because
these
structures
are
out
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean.
they
are
surrounded
by
water
on
four
sides,
and
it
is
inevitable
that
in
the
course
of
performing
duties,
people
are
going
to
be
going
on
and
off
the
water.
we
don't
think
there
is
a
reason
to
think
that
congress
meant
to
eliminate
the
anomaly
of
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
with
respect
to
these
more
familiar
longshoremen
and
ship
repair
people,
but
to
leave
the
same
sort
of
anomaly,
the
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage,
with
respect
to
these
other
employees
who
have
been
found
by
the
courts
to
be
covered
during
part
of
their
activity,
while
they
were
on
actual
navigable
waters.
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
congress
was
trying
to
get
away
from
in
1972.
now,
offshore
oil
workers
like
mr.
gray
are
inherently
amphibious,
as
i
have
said.
they
are
a
far
cry
from
the
truck
driver
who
comes
from
an
inland
point,
who
drops
off
his
cargo
in
the
terminal,
and
who
goes
back
to
the
inland
point.
congress
wanted
to
exclude
those
sorts
of
people
when
it
used
the
status
requirement,
the
maritime
employment
requirement...
here
we've
got
someone
who
is
in
a
much
different
situation,
who
works
constantly
on
or
directly
adjoining
water
virtually
the
whole
time.
and
i
think
it
may
be
worth
noting
in
response
to
justice
powell's
question
about
the
lousiana
compensation
statute,
at
the
time
congress
was
considering
this
problem,
it
noted
that
the
state
compensation
benefits
were
quite
low,
and
i
would
point
out
that
lousiana
in
fact
was
the
lowest
of
the
examples
that
congress
set
out
in
its
report.
so
if
you're
concerned
about
that
sort
of
discrepancy,
so
was
congress.
by
way
of
perspective,
i
think
it
is
useful
to
take
a
minute
to
look
at
the
pre-1972
situation
of
offshore
oil
workers.
substantial
categories
of
these
workers
were
covered,
as
justice
o'connor's
questions
have
suggested,
and
i
think
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
suggestion
in
some
of
the
briefs
in
this
case,
the
amicus
briefs,
that
somehow
by
finding
coverage
for
mr.
gray,
the
court
would
be
bringing
a
whole
new
industry
within
the
longshoremen's
act,
is
not
so
at
all.
it
is
really
inaccurate
to
say
that.
obviously,
most
directly,
congress
had
provided
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
for
coverage,
so
if
you
had
an
oilfield
that
spanned
both
sides
of
the
three-mile
line,
the
employer
knew
that
he
would
be
subject
at
least
outside
that
three-mile
boundary
to
the
longshoremen's
regime.
but
you
also
had
people
who
were
inside
the
three-mile
boundary.
you
had
the
people
on
these
movable
rigs.
and
some
of
these
movable
rigs,
while
they
qualify
as
vessels,
look
very
much
like
fixed
rigs.
there
are
these
jack
up
rigs
that
have
legs
that
extend
and
retract,
and
they
can
sit
right
down
on
the
seabed
floor.
those
people,
if
they
did
not
qualify
as
the
longshoremen's
scheme,
and
you
would
also
have
situations
like
that
of
mr.
gray
in
which
you
had
someone
who
was
traveling
between
fixed
platforms,
and
who
would
be
covered
if
his
injury
was
on
actual
navigable
waters
during
that
sort
of
travel.
and
they
would
continue
to
be
covered
under
the
perini
haven't
mentioned
are
those
like
that
of
mr.
gray,
who
was
injured
while
he
was
working
on
a
fixed
platform
inside
the
three-mile
limit.
he
would
be
sort
of
an
odd
man
out
before
1972.
it
probably
wouldn't
have
been
on
actual
navigable
waters.
but
his
situation
in
which
he
was
having
to
go
back
and
forth
on
actual
navigable
waters
and
on
the
fixed
platforms,
and
depending
on
the
circumstances,
possibly
to
a
movable
rig,
and
certainly
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
certainly
suggests
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
solve
his
situation.
mr.
shelton
of
the
drilling
contractors
association
testified
before
congress
when
it
was
considering
these
amendments,
and
he
said
the
same
thing
that
mr.
brown
has
said.
this
is
an
area
in
which
people
are
subject
to
job
by
job
assignments.
you
have
workers
going
out
to
different
structures.
the
employers
are
confused
because
there
is
the
series
of
compensation
systems,
and
whether
an
employee
is
covered
under
one
as
opposed
to
the
other
may
depend
on
what
kind
of
structure
he
is
on.
extending
coverage
to
a
situation
like
this
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
sort
of
rationalization
that
congress
was
attempting
to
achieve
in
1972.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
we
think
that
this
court
has
noted
that
congress
used
some
broad
language
in
amending
the
statute
in
1972,
and
we
do
think
it
is
clearly
broad
enough
to
encompass
a
situation
like
this
one.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
since
we
are
focusing
on
the
status
requirement
here,
i
guess,
maritime
employment
is
the
category
that
we
have
to
define.
now,
i
think
the
court
and
congress
have
recognized
that
that
is
a
broader
category
than
the
enumerated
occupations
that
follow
it.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
you
would
find
this
sort
of
employee
to
be
maritime
in
the
sense
that
these
employees
are
always
on
the
water
or
right
next
to
the
water.
indeed,
the
whole
industry
has
an
intimate
connection
with
the
ocean,
with
the
water,
with
the
vessels
that
are
used
in
a
variety
of
operations.
so,
i
think,
you
know,
if
you
are
trying
to
think
of
what
congress
might
have
thought
when
it
used
that
term,
sort
of
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
you
would
think
that.
in
addition,
you
had
people
testifying
before
congress
about
the
tower
bill,
and
talking
about
marine
petroleum
workers
and
maritime
extractive
operations.
but
i
think
if
you
go
beyond
that,
you
also
look
to
the
intent
of
congress,
and
this
question
of
the
amphibious
employee,
and
there
i
think
the
maritime
employment
is
also
in
existence
here.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
not
with
respect
to
the
statute
that
was
finally
enacted.
there
was
much
talk
during
the
hearings
about
the
tower
bill,
which
was
the
proposal
to
bring
all
offshore
oil
industry
workers
within
the
statute,
and
that
that
would
include
the
people
who
had
qualified
as
seamen
and
who
were
entitled
to
the
jones
act
remedy.
the
people
who
wanted
that
act
characterized
it
in
terms
of
needing
to
cut
back
on
the
jones
act
remedy
to
avoid
the
seamen
member
of
the
crew
remedy.
the
people
who
opposed
the
bill
said,
no,
we
want
to
retain
that.
there
wasn't
that
much
focus
on
this
other
end
of
the
spectrum
of
the--
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
--well,
i
am
not
sure,
i
am
not
sure
it
was
oversight,
and
the
number
20,000
was
used
in
the
hearings,
at
least.
i
think
that
congress
used
a
typical
example
when
it
was
talking
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
reports.
it
used
the
example
that
people
are
familiar
with
of
the
longshoreman,
who
is
sometimes
on
the
boat
and
sometimes
on
the
dock.
but
i
think
that
congress
was
told
in
the
course
of
these
hearings
by
the
drilling
contractor
representatives
that
a
number
of
these
offshore
oil
people
were
already
covered
under
the
act.
i
think
it
did
not
necessarily
feel
that
it
ought
to
enumerate
each
and
every
sort
of
employee.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
congress
was
aware
that
there
were
some
other
people
out
there
other
than
longshoremen
and
ship
repair
people,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
really
unnatural
for
congress
to
specifically
refer
to
those
more
familiar
types
of
employees,
and
to
have
assumed
that
it
could
sort
of
wrap
up
the
others
in
this
broader
term.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
i
think
to
the
extent
we
would
rely
on
the
legislative
history,
i
would
go
back
to
the
language
in
the
reports
in
both
houses,
in
which
congress
said,
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
is
to
provide
a
uniform
compensation
system
for
those
employees
who
were
covered
for
part
of
their
activity
under
the
old
act.
i
think
that
in
a
nutshell
really
expresses
what
congress
intended
then.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
he
wouldn't
have
been
covered
in
this
particular
fact
circumstance
when
he
was
injured
on
a
fixed
drilling
platform,
but
during
the
course
of
his
employment
there
were
a
number
of
different
situations
in
which
he
would
be
covered.
he
would
be
covered
when
he
was
on
the
boat
between
fixed
platforms,
which
he
did
sometimes
several
times
a
day.
if
he
were
assigned
to
a
drilling
barge
to
do
some
welding
on
that
he
would
clearly
be
covered,
because
he
was
on
actual
navigable
waters.
he
is
covered
when
he
is
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
which
he
was
at
least
part
of
the
time.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
yes,
i
think
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
said.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
i
suppose
that
is
so.
i
think
they
looked
at
the
common
sense,
and
i
suggest
we
look
at
that
plus
what
congress
had
in
mind.
ms.
carolyn
p
corwin
well,
i
don't
think
so.
you
have
addressed
the
longshoremen
and
ship
repair
situation.
you
have
addressed
mr.
churchill
in
the
perini
case
on
actual
navigable
waters.
and
this
is
really,
i
guess,
the
next
step
in
what
you
would
consider
in
that
line.
