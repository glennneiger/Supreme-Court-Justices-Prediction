mr.
wood
brown,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
the
case
of
herb's
welding
versus
gray.
it
is
a
case
involving
the
coverage
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act
to
workmen
on
fixed
platforms
in
inshore
louisiana
waters.
our
position
is
that
congress
did
not
provide
for
the
coverage
of
this
particular
class
of
claimant,
and
that
there
is
no
justification
for
extending
coverage
to
him
and
those
like
him.
the
facts
are
stated
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
the
person
was
working
as
a
welder
on
an
oil
production
platform
within
the
three-mile
limit
offshore
louisiana.
there
was
a
gas
explosion.
he
was
injured
while
he
was
welding.
from
the
record,
we
find
that
he
did
nothing
on
this
work...
on
this
platform
except
to
weld,
and
he
welded
generally
on
everything,
including
gas
lines,
gradings,
railings,
and
things
like
that.
the
record
establishes
that
he
was
doing
some
welding
on
a
gas
lift
line
and
at
one
place
in
the
record,
and
a
gas
flow
line
in
the
other.
that
is
significant
because
a
lift
line
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
transportation
of
the
gas;
a
gas
flow
line
conceivably
could.
the
question
here,
your
honors,
is
not
situs.
in
other
words,
in
a
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act
case,
the
court
has
considered
both
situs
and
status.
we
concede
that
if
this
person
is
found
to
be
a
maritime
worker,
that
the
platform
itself
is
a
place
where
this
particular
type
of
work
is
performed,
and
therefore
situs
would
exist.
the
question
in
the
case
is
status.
in
saying
that,
i
have
to
start
off
by
saying
that
there
is
really
nothing
maritime
in
the
traditional
sense
about
this
type
of
platform.
i
would
like
first
to
get
into
the
concepts
and
the
differences
between
the
opponents
and
the
applicants
with
respect
to
the
details
in
the
litigation.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
case
here,
the
decision
in
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
court's
previous
decision
in
rodrigue
versus
aetna
casualty
and
surety
company.
the
opponents
take
the
position
that
rodrigue
was
a
jurisdictional
case.
i
suggest
that
it
is
not.
i
suggest
that
at
that
particular
point
makes
no
difference,
because
in
rodrigue
this
court
clearly
decided
that
platform
oilfield
labor
was
no
different
from
labor
in
the
oilfields
on
land
or
anywhere
else.
in
other
words,
the
type
of
work
that
this
guy
was
doing
at
the
time
he
was
hurt
is
no
different
from
oilfield
labor
anywhere
else,
either
offshore
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
on
the
platforms
inshore,
or
in
wyoming.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
the
record
does
not
establish
that.
to
the
contrary,
justice,
it
says
that
he
considered
himself
permanently
assigned
to
this
particular
field,
which
would
have
been
on
fixed
platforms.
to
completely
answer
your
question--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--no,
ma'am.
there
is
a
problem
with
your
question,
because
the
term
"platform"
and
the
term
"movable"
are
self-distinctive.
if
the
man
worked
on--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--a
movable
rig,
which
is
usually
a
vessel...
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
it
is
all
the
time
a
vessel
in
the
offshore...
he
would
stand
a
very
good
chance
to
be
a
seaman.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
if
he
was
hurt
on
a
vessel
under
your
decision
in
the
director
versus
perini,
there
is
no
question
that
that
is
all
it
would
take.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
your
honor,
the
hazards
are
no
different--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--there
are
no
difference
at
all.
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
between
a
person
who
is
more
or
less
permanently
assigned
to
a
vessel
and
drilling
or
a
person
who
is
more
or
less
permanently
assigned
to
a
platform
and
drilling.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
because,
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
a
person
more
or
less
permanently
attached
to
a
vessel,
congress
had
before
it
in
the
tower
bill
in...
in
consideration
of
the
tower
bill
in
1972
if...
whether
or
not
to
cover
that
person
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act,
and
deliberately
chose
not
to.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
the
state
of
louisiana
thinks,
and
i
have
called
the
department
of
natural
resources,
they
think
that
there
are
20,000
workers
working
on
inshore
platforms.
they
think
there
are
800
platforms
offshore
louisiana,
and
200
platforms
offshore
texas.
the
department
of
the
interior,
i
called
them.
there
is
no
hard
facts
on
these.
these
are
all
estimates.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
that's
what
the
state
of
louisiana
thinks,
working
offshore.
the
department
of
the
interior
thinks
there
are
nearly
60,000
people
working
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
and
another
70,000
in
what
they
refer
to
as
secondary
and
tertiary
employment.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
ocsla.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
no
question
about
them.
they
are
covered
because
of
the
specific
act
of
congress
which
says
they
are
covered.
now,
in
reviewing
those
acts,
justice,
keep
in
mind
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
text
of
the
ocsla
in
1978,
but
if
you
go
to
the
legislative
history,
it
says
that
they
didn't
intend
to
change
this
particular
doctrine
or
this
particular
application.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
that
was
signed
by
the
president,
i
understand,
over
the
last
weekend.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
those
amendments,
as
i
read
them,
justice,
i
don't
believe
they
have
any
effect
whatever
on
this
case
at
all.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
i
don't
believe
that
those
amendments...
i
have
read
them
carefully,
and
i
don't
believe
those
amendments
have
anything
to
do
with
the
issues
before
the
court
in
this
case.
now,
it
did
address
another
opinion
of
this
court,
and
we
are
going
to...
probably
one
of
us
is
going
to
be
back
in
front
of
you
as
to
whether
it
is
retroactive
or
not.
i
don't
have
any
opinion
on
that
point
at
this
point,
because
i
haven't
researched
it.
i
don't
know
that.
returning
to
the
rodrigue
decision,
your
honors,
if
you
read
through
the
opinion
itself,
it
is
manifest
that
the
court's
decision
in
rodrigue
was
based
on
what
it
felt
congress
had
intended,
but
it
justified
congress's
intention
on
innumerable
places
throughout
the
opinion
by
references
to
this
particular
type
of
work
as
not
being
maritime
or
admiralty
type
work.
and
if
you
look
specifically
at
the
comment
on
page
360
of
the
court's
opinion,
it
said
that
the
accidents
in
rodrigue
and
dory,
which
were
the
two
cases
before
the
court
at
that
time,
the
court
uses
the
word,
this
is
not
"the
ordinary
stuff
of
the
admiralty.
"
in
other
words,
this
type
of
work
is
not
the
type
of
thing
that
you
usually
think
of
when
you
think
of
a
maritime
setting.
now,
of
course,
there
is
no
question
that
the
rodrigue
case
involved
a
platform
three
miles
out,
so
this
guy
with
respect
to
his
claim
under
some
compensation
act
would
have
been
covered
under
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers
act
because
of
ocsla.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
when
the
court
talks
about
his
work
being
nonmaritime,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
type
of
work
that...
the
wire
line
work
that
was
being
done
in
dory
and
rodrigue
and
the
wire
line
work
that
is
done
inside
the
three
mile
limit.
so
that
if
the
work
that
is
done...
described
in
rodrigue
and
dory
is
nonmaritime
because
it
is
nonmaritime,
then
it
is
nonmaritime
because
it
is
inshore
as
well
as
offshore.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
the
ores
offshore
were,
justice.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
because
of
ocsla,
which
was
passed
in
1953.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
think
you
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
original
passage
of
the
act,
because
the
question
of
situs
and
status...
you
are
right.
the
question
of
situs
and
status
is
one
developed--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--yes,
sir.
there
would
have
been
no
coverage--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--that's
what
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
director
versus
perini
case
is.
and
that
is
that
in
director
versus
perini,
the
decision
was,
there
is
coverage
now
because
there
was
coverage
before
1972.
in
this
case,
you
can't
use
that
rationale.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
a
person
working
on
a
vessel
is
clearly
covered.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
well,
he
is
not
covered
under
director
versus
perini.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir.
he
is
covered
on
land
or
on
the
beach
or
a
shore
if
he
is
doing
"maritime
work".
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
and
that
is
the
key
to
this
case.
in
other
words,
you
have
got
to
get
to
the
point
of
whether
or
not
this
court
agrees
with
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
holding
that
oilfield
labor
is
"inherently
maritime
in
nature".
i
don't
believe
it
is,
and
i
think
that
such
a
decision
is
contrary
to
what
this
court
said
in
rodrigue.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
absolutely.
ocsla,
judge,
not
osha.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
say
that
because
i
realize
we
are
being
recorded,
and
i
want
to
be
correct
about
that.
but,
no,
you
are
absolutely
correct.
if
it
was
maritime
in
nature;
if
this
sort
of
work
was
inherently
maritime,
then
there
would
have
been
coverage
prior
to
1972.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
have
to
qualify
the
answer.
if
a
man
is
not
a
seaman,
then
the
answer
is
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
but
if
a
man
is
a
seaman,
then
of
course
by
definition
there
is
no
coverage
under
the
harbor
workers
act.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes.
well,
that
doesn't
necessarily
preclude
him
from
being
a
seaman.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
at
least
not
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
this
is
not
the
case,
because
the
facts
don't
support
it,
but
perhaps
you
are
going
to
have
to
write
us
a
postcript
to
director
versus
perini,
because
that
particular
thing
is
left
over.
in
other
words,
that
is
a
matter,
i
think,
for
future
litigation,
whether
a
person
who
is
strictly...
in
other
words,
he
uses
the
boat
strictly
as
a
taxicab.
is
he
covered
as
a
result
of
an
injury
which
occurs
while
he
is
using
that
boat
as
a
taxicab.
i
don't
think
director
versus
perini
goes
quite
that
far,
although
it
may.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
the
question
to
be
answered
is
whether
or
not
this
court
agrees
with
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
pippin
versus
shell,
pudrough
versus
american
workover,
and
thornton
versus
brown
and
foot,
all
of
which
are
cited,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
there
is
any
support
in
the
jurisprudence
or
otherwise
for
the
proposition
that
oilfield
work
is
inherently
maritime.
if
you
go
back
to
pippin
and
budrough,
you
will
find
that
that
was
one
of
the
rationales
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision.
they
held
first
that
there
was
coverage
because
there
was
coverage
pre-1972,
yet
there
was
also
coverage
because
oil
field
work
is
inherently
maritime.
i
was
counsel
in
the
budrough
case.
i
brought
that
case
to
this
court.
it
was
pending
when
the
director
versus
perini
was
decided,
and
of
course
once
this
court
decided
that
there
was
coverage
if
there
was
coverage
before
1972,
then
of
course
my
writ
got
denied
because
it
was
unnecessary
to
consider
the
rest
of
the
decision.
but
that
is
before
the
court
this
time,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
oilfield
work
is
inherently
maritime,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
as
previously
stated
in
light
of
the
rodrigue
decision,
it
is
not
so
covered.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir,
but--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--in
that
particular
point,
judge,
you've
got
to
remember
that
rodrigue
was
decided
pre-1972,
when
situs
wasn't
an
issue,
and
when
piers
and
wharves
weren't
covered
under
victory
carriers
versus
law
and
nacirema
versus
johnson.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
exactly.
precisely.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
well,
yes,
sir.
i
thought
about
it
a
long
time,
judge,
because
the
act
itself
is
fairly
specific
in
its
listing
of
the
areas
which
are
covered,
but
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
counter
productive
to
try
to
convince
you
that--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--well,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
deal
with
it.
i
think
i
would
lose
it
if
i
forced
you
to
deal
with
it,
judge.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir?
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
well,
the
nature
of
the
recovery
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act
when
mr.
gray
was
injured
in
1972,
the
benefits
were
substantially
less
than
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
worker
act
benefits.
i
think
they
were
like
$85
a
week.
the
louisiana
act
at
that
point
was
in
the
process
of
amendment,
and
now
the
benefits
are,
while
they
are
not
as
handsome
as
the
benefits
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
worker
act,
they
are
close.
the
provisions,
the
computation
is
the
same.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
maximums
under
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers
act
are
substantially
greater
than
the
maximums
under
the
louisiana
compensation
act,
a
difference
of...
i
believe
the
last
figure,
the
maximum
under
the
harbor
workers
act
is
a
little
over
$350,
and
the
maximum
under
the
louisiana
act
is
a
little
over
$200.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
if
he
wins
this
case,
the
only
thing
currently
at
issue
is
whether
or
not
we
get
some
money
back
which
we
paid
him
in
response
to
the
brb's
decision,
and
his
attorney
would
get
paid,
because
we
haven't
paid
the
attorney's
fees.
those
are
the
two
things
at
issue
in
respect
to
mr.
gray.
the
larger
issue
is
the
nearly
150,000
workmen
in
this
area
that
i
defined
before.
that
is
the
larger
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
ma'am,
20,000
working
in
the
offshore
louisiana
area
alone,
but
the
secondary
and
tertiary
employment...
in
other
words,
once
you
get
on
the
beach,
as
i
appreciate
what
the
government
is
talking
about
when
it
gives
these
figures,
it
is
talking
about
people
in
the
transmission
areas
onshore,
the
refinery
areas,
in
other
words,
as
far
out
as
you
get,
and
you
are
talking
about
a
lot
of
people.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
no,
ma'am.
this
particular
case
talks
about
those
20,000
workers
in
louisiana
and
another
corresponding
number
of
workers
in
texas.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
we
are
not
talking
about
that.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
no,
ma'am,
except
that
if
the
maritime
worker
is
not...
except
that
if
a
maritime
worker
is
not...
excuse
me,
an
oilfield
worker
is
not
inherently
maritime,
then
the
underpinning
of
the
thornton
case
falls,
too,
because
thornton
is
the
one
that
said...
it
postulated
from
pippin
and
budrough
that
an
oilfield
worker
is
maritime,
and
it
said
when
you
are
building
a
platform
where
you
are
going
to
do
this
maritime
work,
that
is
maritime
work.
so
if
this...
if
i
am
right
in
this
case,
and
oilfield
work
is
not
maritime,
then
thornton
falls,
too.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
then
i
lose.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
no,
ma'am.
if
this
court
affirms
what
the
fifth
circuit
did,
then
thornton
is
a
correct
result.
yes,
ma'am.
that's
right.
the
second
point
that
the
opponents
make
is
that
there
is
this
argument
that
a
person
should
not
be
forced
to
walk
in
and
out
of
coverage,
and
that
there
should
not
be
checkered
coverage.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
checkered
coverage
and
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
is
a
fact
in
the
oilfield
today.
it
has
been
a
fact
since
the
oilfields
started.
and
it
will
be
a
fact
regardless
of
what
happens
in
this
case,
and
that
is
so
because
these
men
who
work
on
platforms
and
then
move
to
a
vessel,
in
other
words,
a
roughneck
who
is
working
on
a
platform
is
not
a
seaman,
he
is
a
longshoreman
and
harbor
worker
if
he
is
working
more
than
three
miles
out.
if
he
goes
out
for
his
next
seven-day
hitch
and
gets
assigned
to
a
jackup
rig
five
miles
away,
he
is
a
seaman,
and
there
is
no
question
under
those
circumstances
that
he
would
have
no
right
to
be
compensated
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act.
the
gray
area,
of
course,
occurs
when
he
moves
back
to
the
platform,
because
then
if
he
has
got
a
right
of
action
and
damages,
he
would
take
the
position
that
he
would
still
be
a
seaman,
and
the
fifth
circuit
has
looked
with
favor
on
that
sort
of
contention
in
a
number
of
cases.
but
the
point
of
the
argument
is
that
checkered
coverage
and
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
is
a
fact
of
life
in
the
oilfield,
and
it
always
has
been.
congress,
i
suggest
to
the
court,
has
authorized
or
permitted
that
to
continue
when
the
congress
failed
to
pass
the
tower
bill,
because
the
tower
bill
would
in
fact
have
prevented
that
sort
of
thing
from
happening.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
that
somehow
is
hasn't.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
your
honor,
intellectually...
i
am
trying
to
be
intellectually
honest
with
myself.
i
cannot
argue
situs,
because
if
you...
unless
you
figure
that
the
section,
that
the
words
of
section
3
are
exclusive,
and
i
don't
believe
congress
intended
them
to
be.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
and
as
soon
as
you
say
that
if
maritime
work
is
performed
in
a
particular
identifiable
area,
which
i
think
you
have
to
do
on
a
platform,
you
have
to
say
that,
and
once
you
say
that,
then
they
are
situs,
if
oilfield
work
is
inherently
maritime.
i
don't
believe
it
is.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
to
focus
the
situs
argument,
judge,
we
all
know
that
where
longshoring
work
is
done
and
it
is
done
on
a
wharf,
on
a
wharf...
get
away
from
the
platform
business
for
a
second...
it
is
done
on
a
wharf,
that
is
a
maritime
situs,
but
not
everybody
on
the
wharf
is
covered
by
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act
because
he
is
not
doing
maritime
work.
for
instance,
if
you
put
an
oil
well
on
the
end
of
a
wharf
and
drilled
a
well
under
it,
those
oilfield
workers
wouldn't
be
covered
under
the
harbor
workers
act
simply
because
they
were
on
a
wharf.
that
being
so,
they
are
not
covered
by
this
platform.
that
is
the
point.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
one
other
thing
that
i
would
like
to
mention.
there
is
an
argument
by
gray's
counsel
to
the
effect
that
somehow
there
is
an
extension
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
a
meritless
issue,
because
the
fifth
circuit
had
it
before
it
and
failed
to
reach
it,
and
they
reached
coverage
in
this
case
because
of
their
finding
that
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act
applied
under
its
own
force.
i
suggest
to
you
that
you
will
not
find
any
cases
on
point
that
deal
with
this
particular
issue.
there
are,
as
i
count
them,
four
cases
which
talk
about
what
the
words
"as
a
result
of
operations"
mean,
and
all
of
those
cases
have
to
do
with
flights
to
and
from
the
platform
either
on
seaplanes
or
helicopters,
and
i
think
the
result
in
those
cases
are
correct.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
for--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
you
would
have
a
hard
time,
justice,
in
delving
that
out
of
this
record,
but
i
have
to
admit
to
you
that
some
of
the
lines
which
fed
into
this
platform
were
in
fact
coming
from
offshore.
if
you
look
at
the
transcript
which
was
made
up
before
the
administrative
law
judge,
you
will
see
a
map,
and
in
that
map
it
shows
mike
platform,
and
it
is
in
one
definable
area,
and
you
will
see
platforms
coming
in
from
outside
the
three-mile
limit.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
lines,
yes,
sir.
excuse
me.
i
did
say
platforms.
the
reason
that
i
have
trouble
with
making
the
conclusion
that
this
man
at
the
time
of
his
injury
was
working
on
one
of
those
lines
is
the
fact
that
that
map
shows
that
those
lines
were
four-inch
lines,
and
he
said
specifically
on
three
cases
that
they
were
two-inch
lines.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
presumably.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
well,
your
honor--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--well,
in
one
sense
i
guess
you
could
say
that,
but
in
the
same
sense
you
would
have
to
say
that
a
railroad
worker
is
in
the
same
business
as
a
barge
worker
with
a
barge
going
down
the
mississippi
river
because
they
are
both
transporting
goods
from
minneapolis
to
new
orleans.
i
don't
think
the
analogy,
with
all
possible
respect,
i
don't
think
the
analogy
carries.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir.
on
pages...
the
specific
reference
is
on
page
55
of
the
transcript,
and
there
is
another
reference
on
page...
i
can't
find
it
right
now.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
it
says
he
was
working
on
a
two-inch
line.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir,
and
it
is
a
particularly
good
quote,
because
it
is
not...
nobody
led
him
into
it.
they
said,
what
happened
to
you?
he
said,
i
was
working
on
a
two-inch
line.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
i
said
that,
judge,
and
perhaps
it
was
a
concession
that
i
shouldn't
have
made.
i
would
suspect
that
in
reading
the
record,
you
could
draw
the
conclusion
that
at
one
time
or
another
he
worked
on
the
flow
line
going
from
offshore
onshore.
he
wasn't
working
on
that
particular
flow
line
at
this
particular
time,
according
to
this
record.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir,
the
board...
benefits
review
board
drew
it,
and
i
don't
know
where
they
got
it
from.
it
is
not
in
the
record.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
supportable
in
the
record.
but
of
course
we
are
not
dealing
with
what
the
benefits
review
board
found
because
the
court
of
appeals
simply
rejected
or
ignored
its
rationale.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
well,
sir,
you
would...
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that...
i
know
the
court
is
in
the
business
sometimes
of--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--i
understand
that.
i
realize
that
the
court
is
in
the
business
of
drawing
lines,
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
congress
when
it
passed
the
ocsla
and
then
repassed
it
again
in
1978
and
made
it
a
strict
geographical
test
for
those
areas
outside
the
three-mile
limit,
that
the
court
ought
to
respect
that
which
congress
has
stated
and
not
extend
ocsla
to
areas--
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
--i
suspect
that
there
could
be
some...
if
the
court
found
that
there
was
any
merit
to
that
issue.
of
course,
the
court
has
got
to
realize
that
once
you
extend
ocsla
beyond
its
limits
as
a
result
of
these
operations
and
the
result
of
that
language,
where
is
the
back
line?
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
it
has
not
been
briefed.
that
is
correct.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
washington
metropolitan,
judge.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
i
won't
take
the
time,
judge.
i
think
that
what
the
court
has
to
look
at,
and
i
think
what
is
apparent
in
reading
the
act
and
the
cases
which
have
arisen
under
the
act
arising
from...
coming
from
this
court
is
that
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act
deals
essentially
with
vessel-related
activity,
and
this
is
not
a
vessel-related
case.
i
think
that
takes
this
case
out
of
the
coverage
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act.
justice
white,
you
asked
the
question
of
whether
there
was
any
change
in
maritime
employment
in
the
1972
act.
the
forthright
answer
is,
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
they
did
not
change
that
definition.
so
the
definition
that
this
court
came
down
with
before
1972
presumably
still
applies.
mr.
wood
brown,
iii
that's
correct.
and
counsel
says
that
mr.
gray
was
an
odd
man
out.
well,
he
was
an
odd
man
out
before
1972,
and
if
congress
wanted
to
take
him
out
of
the
category
of
being
an
odd
man
out,
congress
had
the
opportunity
in
1972,
and
they
had
the
opportunity
again
in
1984.
that
doesn't
really
apply
to
this
case,
but
there
is
no
action
by
congress
in
either
case
to
take
him
out,
and
under
those
circumstances
the
failure
to
pass,
whether
it
was
conscious
or
just
a
refusal
or
somebody
didn't
get
around
to
it,
the
failure
to
pass
the
tower
case
is,
i
believe,
significant.
if
there
is
a
problem
with
respect
to
this
worker's
coverage,
congress
should
correct
it,
i
suggest,
and
congress
has
that
power,
as
this
court
noted
in
victory
carriers
versus
law
under
articles
i
and
iii
of
the
constitution
to
do
so.
that
is
all
i
have.
thank
you,
sir.
