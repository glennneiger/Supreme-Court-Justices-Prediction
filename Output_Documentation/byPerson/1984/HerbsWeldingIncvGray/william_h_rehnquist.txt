mr.
brown,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
this
particular
respondent
was
in
fact
working
on
two-inch
line?
justice
rehnquist
that
shows
he
was
working
on
two-inch
line?
justice
rehnquist
not
four-inch
line?
justice
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
he
was
working
on
four-inch
line?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
why
do
you
say
presumably
he
was...
we
are
talking
about
a
record,
not
what
you
may
know
outside
the
record.
justice
rehnquist
did
any
of
the
fact
finders
below
draw
that
conclusion?
justice
rehnquist
didn't
it
also
contract
the
coverage
in
some
areas?
justice
rehnquist
weren't
the
'72
amendments
supposed
to
be
kind
of
a
compromise
that
gave
some
things
to
the
plaintiff's
side
and
some
things
to
the
defendant's
side?
justice
rehnquist
we
have
had
about
half
a
dozen
rather
close
cases
here
since
then,
haven't
we,
involving
the
'72
amendments?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
and
we
have
decided
every
one
of
them
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
isn't
it
about
time
we
decided
a
case
in
favor
of
the
defendant?
