justice
white
well,
except
for
those
covered
by
the
outer
continental
lands
act,
prior
to
'72,
none
of
these
workers
on
these
drilling
platforms
were
covered
by
the
longshoremen's
act.
isn't
that--
justice
white
--yes,
offshore
because
of
the--
justice
white
--yes,
that's
what
i
say,
but
aside
from
that,
it
is
agreed
that
you
either...
they
are
either
covered
by
the
'72
amendments
or
not
at
all.
justice
white
and
the
question
is,
then,
what
did
congress
intend
by
the
amendments
in
'72.
justice
white
it
has
to
be
changed
by
'72.
justice
white
because
it
is
agreed
that
there
weren't
any
coverage
before
that
except
under
osha.
justice
white
well,
the
'72
act
at
least
extended
coverage
to
those
people
who
would
have
been
covered
if
they
were
working
on
the
ship,
but
they
were
working
on
the
shore,
too,
and
they
certainly
extended
the
coverage
to
them.
justice
white
well,
even
if
he
is
working
on
a
beach.
justice
white
no,
no,
i
mean
under
the
'72
amendments.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
wouldn't...
if
work
on
these
platforms
had
been
maritime
in
nature,
wouldn't
there
have
been
coverage
before
1972--
justice
white
--wholly
aside
from
osha?
justice
white
ocsla.
i
am
sorry.
justice
white
of
course,
rodrigue
might
raise
some
question
even
about
your
concession
about
situs,
because
rodrigue
said
that...
at
least
it
recited
that
these
were
islands.
justice
white
not
piers.
justice
white
i
know,
but
just
extending
the
coverage
to
piers
and
wharves
doesn't
extend
coverage
to
iowa.
justice
white
so
i
don't
know
why
you
want
to
concede
situs,
but
nevertheless
you
have.
justice
white
i
don't
want
to
have
to
deal
with
things
you
don't
want
us
to
deal
with.
justice
white
i
don't
know.
mr.
brown?
justice
white
i
don't
know
at
all.
mr.
brown?
justice
white
you
mean
lines?
justice
white
if
we
agree
with
you,
i
suppose
we
would
remand
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
reach
the
other
possible
ground.
justice
white
that
is
a
possibility.
justice
white
that
may
be
right,
but
wouldn't
we
want
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
first
on
the
issue
that...
on
the
ground
that
the
benefits
review
board
reached?
justice
white
well,
you
suggest
we
would
decide
that
issue
on
the
merits
here?
it
hasn't
been
briefed.
justice
white
i
don't
know
why
we
would
want
to
just
do
it
on
our
own.
mr.
brown,
may
i
ask
you
one
unrelated
question?
justice
white
why
would
he?
justice
white
you
have
to
establish
that,
i
take
it.
you
think
that
is
critical
to
your
case.
namely,
the
'72
amendments
didn't
intend
to
cover
anybody
who
never
would
have
been
covered
before
'72?
justice
white
walking
in
and
out.
justice
white
even
if
he
was
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
or
anything
else.
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
problem
was
not
just
situs.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
it
is.
let's
assume
it
is,
just
for
the
moment,
that
prior
to
'72
this
kind
of
employment
was
not
considered
maritime
employment.
justice
white
let's
just
assume
that.
and
you
think
congress
intended
to
change
the
definition
of
maritime
employment
by
the
'72
amendments?
justice
white
i
understand
that.
but
nevertheless,
let's
assume
it
was
not
considered
maritime
employment.
unless
you
answer
that,
you
are
not
really
meeting
the
argument
of
your
adversary.
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
you
would
mean
by
who
was
considering
it
to
be
maritime
employment.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1972
in
terms
of
the
sort
of
employee
it
was
trying
to
bring
within
this
statute.
well,
then,
you
just
don't
want
to
assume
that
it
was
not
maritime
employment
prior
to
'72.
justice
white
that
is
all
right
with
me,
if
you
don't--
justice
white
--i
will
just
put
it
to
you
this
way.
do
you
think
that
whatever
maritime
employment
was
prior
to
'72,
do
you
think
congress
intended
to
change
the
definition
of
maritime
employment
in
'72?
justice
white
your
adversary
says
that
the
prior
cases
in
this
court
and
others
indicate
that
this
is
not
maritime
employment
prior
to
'72
and
afterwards.
justice
white
well,
this
fellow
wouldn't
have
been
covered
prior
to
'72.
justice
white
isn't
the
heart
of
the...
don't
you
think
the
heart
of
the
fifth
circuit's
holding
in
this
case
is
their
statement
that
offshore
drilling,
the
discovery,
recovery,
and
sale
of
oil
and
natural
gas
from
the
sea
bottom
is
maritime
commerce?
it
goes
on
to
say
that
this
is...
and
gray's
activity
was
part
of
that
commerce.
justice
white
if
they
had
come
out
the
other
way,
that
offshore
drilling
is
not
maritime
commerce
at
all,
the
result
would
have
been
different
in
this
case,
i
suppose.
justice
white
but
we
don't
have
any
cases
that
are
addressed
to
this,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
white
just
like
he
wouldn't
have
had
if
he
was
in
state
waters.
justice
white
do
you
think
to
recover
gray
has
to...
you
have
to
hold
that
gray
was
injured
in
an
area
that
is
customarily
used
by
an
employer
in
loading,
unloading,
repairing,
or
building
a
vessel?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--that
is
used
by
his
employer.
justice
white
well,
what
vessel?
what
was
this
employer
doing
to
load
or
unload
or
repair
a
vessel,
or
building
a
vessel?
don't
they
take
this
oil
and
gas
in
by
pipes?
justice
white
they
don't
load
it
on
the
ships.
justice
white
well,
what...
is
this
area
customarily
used
in
loading
and
unloading
or
repairing
a
vessel?
justice
white
but
he
doesn't
have
to
be
engaged
in
any
activity
that
is
related
to
loading
or
unloading
a
vessel?
justice
white
because
he
certainly
wasn't.
justice
white
was
he
repairing
a
pipe?
justice
white
and
before
'72,
for
coverage,
the
employer
had
to
be
in
a
maritime
activity.
