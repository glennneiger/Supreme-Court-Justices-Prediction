mr.
brown?
justice
o'connor
did
mr.
gray
spend
some
time
doing
work
on
movable
platforms
as
well?
justice
o'connor
if
he
did
spend
time
doing
this
kind
of
work
also
on
movable
platforms,
would
he
be
covered
because
of
the
caputo
doctrine
and
holding?
justice
o'connor
a
movable--
justice
o'connor
--and
probably
it
would
be
maritime
coverage,
even
if
he
were
doing
the
same
type
of
work?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
are
the
hazards
different--
justice
o'connor
--in
working
on
a
movable
rig
and
a
fixed
platform?
justice
o'connor
well,
then,
why
isn't
it
logical
to
assume
that
congress
intended
coverage
here?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
that
the
nonaction
by
congress
doesn't
either
help
you
or
hurt
you
in
this
particular
regard.
let
me
ask
you
how
many
platforms
and
workers
this
decision
is
likely
to
affect.
how
many
fixed
platforms
and
workers
are
we
talking
about
overall?
justice
o'connor
but
you
would
estimate
20,000?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
they
were
working
on
a
fixed
platform
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
presumably
coverage
would
be
extended
by
the
ocsla.
justice
o'connor
ocsla.
justice
o'connor
however
you
want
to
pronounce
it.
right?
justice
o'connor
they
would
be
covered.
we
know
that.
justice
o'connor
mr.
brown,
congress
has
just
in
the
last
few
days
enacted
an
amendment--
justice
o'connor
--to
the
statute,
has
it
not,
to
define
employees,
and
who
is
covered
and
who
isn't?
justice
o'connor
now,
would
you
plan
to
address
yourself
to
the
effect,
if
any,
on
this
case
of
those
amendments?
justice
o'connor
certainly
this
was
filed
earlier,
but
assuming
that
it
applied,
would
it
affect
in
any
way
the
resolution
of
a
case
like
this
in
the
future?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
brown,
i
guess
even
before
'72
there
might
have
been
coverage
for
any
injury
received
if
he
had
been
working
on
a
movable
rig,
right?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
yes,
right,
but
we
are
assuming
he
is
not
a
seaman,
he
is
a
welder
on
a
movable
rig.
justice
o'connor
well,
all
right.
okay.
but
making
that
assumption.
justice
o'connor
and
he
also
would
have
been
covered
had
he
been
injured
going
over
the
water
to
and
from
the
platform
before
'72.
justice
o'connor
it
may.
yes.
okay.
justice
o'connor
i
thought
you
said
20,000.
now
it
is
150,000.
justice
o'connor
that
is
not
what
this
case
involves,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
we
are
talking
about
movable
rigs
and
not
the
ca5's
decision
having
to
do
with
building
a
platform
onshore.
justice
o'connor
no.
justice
o'connor
well,
suppose
you
are
wrong
in
this
case.
justice
o'connor
does
that
necessarily
affect
the
other
situation
of
building
platforms
on
the
shore?
justice
o'connor
mr.
brown,
may
i
just
ask
you
one
more
question
before
you
do?
justice
o'connor
some
of
the
oil
and
gas
lines
that
mr.
gray
was
working
on
presumably
were
lines
that
were
used
to
transfer
oil
or
gas
from
under
the
bed
of
the
water
into
whatever
vehicle
is
going
to
take
the
oil
away.
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
presumably
he
would
be
working
on
it
part
of
the
time.
justice
o'connor
and
i
just
wonder
if
that
doesn't
bring
this
individual
pretty
close
to
the
business
of
being
really
involved
in
loading
or
transferring
oil
and
gas.
justice
o'connor
for
the
purpose
of
maritime
employment.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
nobody
had
to
define
it
before
1975.
it
wasn't
a
requirement,
was
it?
justice
o'connor
so
nobody
had
to
decide
that
question.
before
'72,
i
mean.
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
the
1984.
justice
o'connor
what
is
your
view
on
that?
and
would
the
substantial
relationship
test
of
the
ca5
which
you
are
supporting
lead
to
approval
of
the
result
of
coverage
as
well
for
workers
onshore
building
a
platform?
justice
o'connor
but
if
you
adopt
the
substantial
relationship
test,
that
is
precisely
the
test
which
ca5
has
used
to
reach
that
kind
of
worker
as
well.
justice
o'connor
every
day,
but
not
when
the
accident
occurred.
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
this
is
something
that
he
did
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events,
every
day.
he
traveled
over
water
where
he
would
be
covered,
and
he
would
load
and
unload,
but
when
he
was
injured,
he
was
welding
on
a
line.
justice
o'connor
yes.
