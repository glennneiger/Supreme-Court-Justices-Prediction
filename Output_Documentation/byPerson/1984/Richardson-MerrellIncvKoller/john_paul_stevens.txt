justice
stevens
mr.
walsh,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
justice
stevens
because
in
addition
to
the
factual
problem
of
this
kind
of
a
factual
case,
i
was
not
entirely
clear
as
to
the
legal
standards
that
the
district
judge
applied.
what
is
it?
is
it
any
time
in
an
adversary
proceeding
and
during
discovery
somebody
tries
to
frustrate
his
opponent's
efforts
to
get
full
discovery
it
is
disqualification?
justice
stevens
is
there
any
precedent
for
disqualifying
a
lawyer
for
that
reason?
justice
stevens
and
the
remedy
was
disqualification
of
the
lawyer.
i
can
understand
it
as--
justice
stevens
--a
disciplinary
matter
or
something
like
that.
normally
our
disqualification
cases
are
conflict
of
interest.
it
is
a
little
bit
of
an
unusual
situation
as
far
as
i
see.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
one
other
question
going
to
the
legal
rules,
do
you
think
it
is
clear
that
a
different
standard
should
apply
to
out-of-town
counsel
and
a
regular
member
of
the
bar?
justice
stevens
you
don't?
justice
stevens
in
terms
of
a
remedy
for
misconduct,
would
you
say
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
disqualify
a
lawyer
unless
it
were
also
appropriate
to
impose
some
kind
of
discipline?
justice
stevens
and,
in
this
case
did
the
judge
refer
the
matter
to
anybody
for
disciplinary
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
one
question.
mr.
walsh,
that
is
prompted
by
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
whole
prejudice
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
based
on
something
you
said
in
your
opening
argument,
would
you
think
that
there
would
be
an
absence
of
prejudice
regardless
of
who
has
the
burden
if
your
client
could
show
in
the
subsequent
proceedings
here
that
there
were
other
counsel
equally
well
recognized
in
the
profession
as
those
who
were
disqualified
who
would
take
the
work...
substitute
their
same
rate
of
pay
and
all
the
rest.
would
that
disprove
prejudice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
does
it
not
follow...
if
that
is
an
adequate
disproof
of
prejudice,
you
will
never
have
prejudice
in
any
of
these
cases
because
the
bar
is
big
enough.
there
is
always
another
lawyer
out
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you
are
saying
if
the
case
is
so
weak
that
you
don't
care
who
represents
the
plaintiff,
why,
you
would
not
worry
about
it.
justice
stevens
you
could
file
a
motion
in
that
case.
