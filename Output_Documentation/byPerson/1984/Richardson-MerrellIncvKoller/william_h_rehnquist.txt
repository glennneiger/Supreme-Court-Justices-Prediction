justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
hold
that
any
of
the
findings
were
clearly
erroneous?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
walsh,
i
am
somewhat
loathed
to
ask
you
this
question,
but
i
think
it
is
bound
to
be
in
the
back
of
one's
mind.
is
this
sort
of
brouhaha
between
mr.
allis
and
ms.
janowski
and
some
of
the
attorneys
in
your
group
a
fairly
common
incident
of
the
litigation
practice
nowadays?
justice
rehnquist
if
it
is,
i
am
glad
i
went
on
the
bench.
[laughter]
justice
rehnquist
how
much
other
options
does
a
court
have
when
you
are
dealing
with
people
admitted
pro
hac
vice?
where
do
the
lawyers
here
practice,
in
california?
justice
rehnquist
that
the
district
court
should
refer
the
matter
to
the
california
bar
for
discipline?
justice
rehnquist
if
the
district
court
excerised
the
power
of
contempt...
i
have
seen
enough
cases
come
up
here...
then
the
yelling
that,
no,
they
should
have
just
disqualified
them.
justice
rehnquist
it
is
a
second
guessing
operation.
justice
rehnquist
so,
if
it
were
perfectly
outrageous
conduct
on
the
part
of
an
attorney
at
one
stage
of
the
case,
and
yet
he
was
obviously
totally
penitent
and
said
i
won't
do
it
again,
the
district
court
would
be
obligated
not
to
disqualify
him,
even
though
he
would
have
violated
15
canons
at
the
time
he
committed
the
outrageous
conduct.
justice
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
your
view
of
disqualification?
justice
rehnquist
was
the
nyquist
decision
based
on
conflict?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
seems
to
me
one
could
take...
could
quite
easily
distinguish
between
situations
where
there
have
been
conflicts
and
where
one
gets
a
certain
feeling
of
gamesmanship
in
efforts
to
disqualify
which
don't
relate
to
court
conduct
at
all.
but,
when
you
are
dealing
with
conduct
before
the
court,
i
don't
see
nyquist
as
an
authority
for
that.
justice
rehnquist
are
you
at
some
point
going
to
discuss
mr.
butler's
conduct?
justice
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
credit
his
version
of
his
motive?
justice
rehnquist
why
is
it
a
first
amendment
case?
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
after
a
trial
court
rules
that
important
evidence
in
the
case
is
not
admissible
to
send
the
evidence
to
the
newspapers?
justice
rehnquist
you
would
apply
that
to
say
a
prosecutor
who
views
what
he
thinks
is
the
erroneous
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
as
an
issue
far
transcending
just
the
guilt
of
this
defendant
so
he
decides
to
send
the
person's
confession,
which
the
court
has
suppressed,
to
the
newspapers?
justice
rehnquist
because
the
jurors
would
be
asked
if
they
had
read
this
article?
justice
rehnquist
then
you
can
say
with
respect
to
any
disclosure
to
a
newspaper
of
evidence
which
a
trial
court
has
ordered
suppressed
in
an
earlier
hearing,
it
won't
prejudice
the
selection
of
the
jury
because
if
they
have
read
about
it
in
the
newspaper
they
will
be
excluded
from
the
jury.
that
is
just
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy.
