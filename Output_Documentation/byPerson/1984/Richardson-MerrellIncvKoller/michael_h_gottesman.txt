mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you,
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
may
be
helpful
at
the
outside
to
define
a
little
more
clearly
the
posture
in
which
this
case
is
here
and
more
precisely
how
it
got
through
the
two
lower
courts.
the
district
court
proceeded
on
a
set
of
assumptions
about
how
it
could
decide
the
disqualification
issue
which
no
one
defends
in
this
court.
the
district
court
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
because
these
lawyers
had
been
admitted
pro
hac
vice
they
could
be
disqualified
on
grounds
less
substantial
than
those
that
would
be
applicable
to
regularly
admitted
counsel.
the
court
expressly
said
that
in
its
opinion.
and,
the
court
said
further
that
precisely
because
of
that
reason
she
was
not
going
to
go
on
to
determine
whether
these
lawyers
had
engaged
in
any
definable
act
of
misconduct,
any
violation
of
disciplinary
rules;
that
it
was
sufficient
in
her
view
if
their
conduct
was
"impermissible
in
the
view
of
the
court.
"
so,
that
was
the
standard
by
which
these
lawyers
were
judged.
was
it
impermissible
in
the
view
of
the
court?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
your
honor,
the
court
expressly
said
that
she
was
not
making
the
assessment
of
whether
these
counsel
had
violated
the
prevailing
standards.
at
one
point
during
the
hearing,
for
example,
she
said
to
mr.
allis
while
he
was
on
the
witness
stand...
this
is
page
166
of
the
joint
appendix...
i
will
not
decide
whether
mr.
allis
violated
any
canon
of
conduct.
so,
we
had
sort
of
a
standard
list
determination
that
in
the
view
of
this
judge
this
was
impermissible
and
that
that
is
all
it
took
because
these
lawyers
were
from
out
of
town.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
that
and
said
that
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
the
local
rules.
the
local
rules
are
quite
clear
that
once
an
out-of-town
counsel
is
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
a
case,
that
counsel
is
to
be
judged
by
the
identical
standards
that
are
applicable
to
regularly
admitted
counsel.
the
court
quoted
from
the
rules
and
explained
that
that
was
the
applicable
situation.
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
what
he
understood
to
be
required
before
lawyers
could
be
disqualified
in
a
case.
it
said,
look,
the
question
here
is,
first
of
all,
they
said,
there
must
be
a
definable
act
of
misconduct,
there
must
be
a
violation
of
the
standard
of
conduct
under
the
disciplinary
rules
or
of
some
rule
of
court
or,
indeed,
of
some
implicit
powers
that
the
court
has
to
control
its
own
courtroom.
it
is
understood
that
the
courts
have
those
and
can
exercise
a
contempt
power
over
them.
but,
there
must
be
one
of
those
things
before
a
court
can
disqualify
lawyers
because,
after
all,
what
is
disqualification?
you
have
lawyers
and
clients
who
have
entered
into
a
contract.
in
a
free
society,
they
are
entitled
to
do
so.
disqualification
is
vitiation
of
that
contract
to
the
substantial
injury
of
both
parties
to
that
contract.
it
was
particularly
aggravated
in
this
case
because
these
lawyers
had
invested
literally
6,000
hours
in
the
preparation
of
this
case
for
trial
and
it
was
due
to
go
to
trial
imminently
and
their
disqualification
meant
that
people
were
going
to
have
to
start
over.
but,
the
court
said
at
a
minimum
to
justify--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--there
are
eight
lawyers
who
have
entered
appearances
in
this
case,
your
honor.
several
of
them,
including
mr.
stein,
entered
appearances
solely
to
represent
the
lawyers
in
the
disqualification
proceeding
when
it
was
undertaken.
two
others--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
what
the
record
clearly
shows,
and
this
is
not
contradicted,
is
that
in
terms
of
preparation
of
the
case
on
the
merits
for
trial
mr.
butler
and
mr.
allis
were
regarded
as
the
principal
trial
counsel.
they
had
done
the
yeoman's
work...
they
had
done
almost
all
the
major
preparation.
two
other
lawyers
had
done
some
work
in
preparation
for
being
back-ups,
assistants
to
mr.
butler
and
mr.
allis.
but,
it
is
not
disputable
that
they
were
the
two
lawyers
who
were
gearing
up
to
try
this
case.
the
other
lawyers,
this
number
that
accumulates
to
eight,
are
lawyers
who
were
not
participating
actively
in
the
present
preparation
of
this
case
on
the
merit.
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
must
have
a
definable
act
of
misconduct.
secondly,
the
court
of
appeals
said
not
every
definable
act
of
misconduct
should
produce
a
disqualification.
there
are
ways
to
punish
misconduct.
there
are
obviously
sanctions
that
the
bar
can
impose
and
there
are
sanctions
that
the
court
can
impose
through
its
contempt
power.
disqualification,
unlike
those
punitive
sanctions,
has
the
very
unpleasant
side
effect
that
it
deprives
the
client
of
the
lawyer
of
his
choice
and
can
do
so
in
a
way
that
will
be
very
injurious,
which
i
want
to
get
into
at
some
length.
so,
said
the
court,
we
agree
with
the
second
circuit
rule
in
nyquist
which
has
now
been
rather
generally
embraced
by
the
commentators
and
by
several
courts
of
appeals,
that
where
disqualification
is
contemplated,
its
purpose
is
not
punishment
of
the
lawyers,
punish
the
lawyers
other
ways.
the
function
of
disqualification
is
to
assure
that
lawyers
will
not,
by
remaining
in
the
case,
imperil
the
integrity
of
the
trial.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
california,
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
district
court...
if
these
people
had
done
a
wrong,
and
they
had
not,
but
if
they
done
a
wrong,
the
district
court
would
have
had
the
power
of
contempt
over
them.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
we
wouldn't
be
yelling
that
at
all.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
there
is
a
difference,
your
honor,
and
this
is
what
all
the
courts
have
said,
you
have
to
decide
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
disqualification?
disqualification
is
not
a
form
of
punishment.
the
petitioner's
brief
is
emphatic
about
that
in
this
court.
we
are
not
contending
that
disqualification
is
a
form
of
punishment.
what
we
are
saying
is
disqualification
is
a
prophylactic.
it
is
a
means
to
assure
that
there
will
not
be
further
conduct
that
imperils
the
trial.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
the
district
court
could
not
find
that
his
continued
participation
in
that
case
would
imperil
the
integrity
of
the
trial,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
could
cite
him
for
contempt,
could
prosecute
him
for
contempt,
could
cite
him
to
his
bar
association,
whether
it
be
this
state
or
another.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
is
now...
it
started
with
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
nyquist.
it
has
now
been
followed
by
the
d.c.
circuit,
by
the
ninth
circuit,
and
every
commentator
in
the
area.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
was
what
was
involved
in
that
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
question
of
whether
gamesmanship
was
at
work
here,
your
honor,
is
one
that
i
want
to
get
to
because
it
goes
to
the
whole
appealability
issue
and
the
need
for
an
interlocutory
appeal.
but,
even
if
one
were
to
say
that
they
were
not
going
to
require
the
second
element
and
we
firmly
believe
the
second
element
is
correct,
that
disqualification
is
not
a
means
of
punishing
unless
one
wants
to
punish
the
client
and
there
are
other
ways
to
punish
the
lawyer.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
because
there
are
punitive
sanctions
that
can
be
used
against
lawyers
who
misbehave,
there
are
deterrents.
disqualification
is
punishment
largely
of
the
client,
not
only
of
the
lawyer,
and
that
is
why
the
principle
has
developed
that
disqualification
should
not
be
used
simply
because
there
was
misconduct
by
a
lawyer,
because
the
implications
for
the
clients
are
severe.
i
do
want
to
turn
to
that
because
that
is,
after
all,
the
threshold
question
here
which
is
appealability.
but
i
do
want
to
say
just
a
minute
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
allis
and
butler
and
why
it
was
not
prepared
to
tolerate
their
disqualification
in
this
case.
i
have
indicated
the
district
court
decision
can't
stand.
nobody
is
defending
the
approach
by
which
the
district
court
decided
this
case.
no
one
is
defending
it
here.
but,
petitioner
asked
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
first
proposition
to
decide
this
case
under
the
rights
standard.
they
say
you
decide
whether
allis
and
butler
engaged
in
an
act
of
misconduct
and
you
decide
whether
the
district
court's
result
could
be
justified
by
the
application
of
the
proper
principle.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
well,
obviously
we
can't
do
that
if
it
turns
on
disputed
issues
that
the
district
court
didn't
decide,
but
on
this
record
there
are
no
disputed
issues
that
are
necessary
for
us
to
recognize
that,
number
one,
mr.
allis
committed
no
act
of
misconduct,
no
conceivable
act
of
misconduct.
what
did
he
do?
his
secretary
came
to
him
one
day
and
made
a
statement
to
him
that
the
other
side
was
trying
to
extract
a
false
statement
from
her
with
promises
of
money.
we
now
know
that,
in
fact,
she
did
receive
substantial
sums
from
the
other
side
after
that.
and,
she
said
those
statements
are
not
true.
the
truth
is
that
your
client's
case
is
genuine
and
she
has
never
said
anything
to
me
to
the
contrary.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
he
could
only
possibly
be
a
witness--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
the
concurring
opinion
raised
that
possibility.
that
would
depend,
first
of
all,
on
whether
the
petitioners
were
going
to
call
ms.
janowski
at
trial.
when
that
question
was
asked
of
them,
they
said
that
in
light
of
subsequent
evidences
that
one
might
call
of
an
impeaching
nature
about
ms.
janowski's
character
they
were
not
at
all
certain
they
were
going
to
call
ms.
janowski
at
trial.
and,
of
course,
if
they
were
not
going
to
call
her,
then
mr.
allis
would
not
possibly
be
a
witness.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
at
some
point
the
petitioner
was
going
to
have
to
announce
a
final
decision
on
that
point.
if
the
announcement
that
she
was
going
to
be
a
witness,
then
the
question,
your
honor,
would
have
to
be
addressed.
in
this
case,
the
standard
is
that
he
must
withdraw
at
that
point
if
it
is
obvious
that
he
should
be
a
witness.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
uniquely
may
not
meet
the
second
of
the
three
factors
because
then
the
question
of
whether
that
judgment
is
correct,
that
is
to
say
whether
the
lawyer
truly
was
needed
as
a
witness,
can't
be
made
until
the
trial.
so,
as
the
sixth
circuit
said,
this
is
the
one
area
where
we
can
recognize
that
in
a
civil
case
a
disqualification
order
might
not
be--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i
think
there
is
a
respectable
argument
to
be
made
for
that
position.
it
in
no
way
jeopardizes
our
position
on
appealability.
but,
the
thing
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
mr.
allis
did
absolutely
nothing
wrong.
the
assertion
that
the
district
court
found
that
he
was
desiring
to
thwart
an
investigation
is
not
an
accurate
reflection
of
what
the
district
court
found.
the
district
court's
sole
finding
as
to
allis'
intent
is
that
he
wanted
to
get
a
written,
sworn
statement
from
his
secretary
retracting
what
she
had
told
the
other
side
and
that
is
correct,
because,
after
all,
she
had
told
him
what
was
told
to
the
other
side
was
false.
she
also
told
him
she
was
about
to
run
off
to
mexico.
and,
he
asked,
are
you
willing
to
put
that...
what
you
have
just
told
me
in
a
sworn
statement
and
she
said
yes.
so,
the
district
court
found
he
had
the
intent
to
take
a
statement
from
his
secretary
retracting
what
she
had
told
the
other
side.
then
the
district
court
announced
what
were
a
series
of
legal
propositions.
he
had
a
duty
not
to
do
that.
allis
has
the
duty
to
investigate
whether
his
client
is
committing
a
fraud
upon
the
court.
he
had
no
such
duty.
the
court
of
appeals
convincingly
demonstrates
that
he
had
no
such
duty.
this
is
not
a
case
where
he
knew
his
client
was
engaged
in
a
fraud.
he
had
overwhelming
evidence
supporting
the
good
faith
of
his
client
and
his
own
secretary
was
telling
him
things
that
supported
it.
the
court
then
said
in
its
conclusion
on
page
77a,
because
he
had
this
duty
and
because
he
took
a
retraction
from
his
secretary,
that
can
be
characterized
as
an
attempt
to
thwart
an
investigation
by
the
court.
so,
a
notion
that
that
was
his
state
of
mind
and
that
is
what
the
court
has
found
is
not
accurate.
the
court
found
only
that
he
took
a
statement
from
a
witness
believing
it
to
be
true
which
she
was
telling
him
was
true.
that
is
not
a
violation
of
anything.
it
is
a
great
injustice
to
both
him
and
to
the
client
that
he
was
disqualified
in
this
case.
now,
i
want
to
turn
to
the
issue
of
appealability
because
it
obviously
is
the
threshold
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
like
to,
your
honor,
yes.
maybe
i
should
do
it
now
and
do
appealability
at
the
end.
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
at
length
that
a
finding
is
not
permissible
that
butler
had
an
improper
motive
here.
he
could
not
conceivably
have
thought
that
what
he
gave
to
morton
mintz
was
going
to
be
in
the
hands
of
the
ultimate
jury.
the
questions
had
already
been
filed
by
the
defendant
that
were
going
to
be
asked
of
every
prospective
jury,
have
you
read
about
that?
he
knew
that.
he
is
an
experienced
trial
lawyer.
they
were
not
going
to
be
on
the
jury
if
they
had
read
that
article.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
he
said
what
his
motive
was,
your
honor.
he
said,
i
have
spent
the
two
years
of
my
life
trying
to
get
this
drug
off
the
market,
this
drug
is
dangerous
in
my
view.
i
have
additional
information
now
to
support
that.
i
am
getting
it
to
the
food
and
drug
administration
and
i
think
that
it
should
be
in
the
hands
of
the
public.
he
was
telling
that
not
only
to
morton
mintz.
on
the
same
day
that
the
mintz
article
appeared
in
the
washington
post,
the
record
shows
butler
appearing
on
a
telecast
in
los
angeles
where
so
far
as
i
know
none
of
the
jury...
prospective
jurors...
in
which
he
was
again
in
los
angeles
advocating
the--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no,
the
district
court
did
not.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
the
district
court's
rejection
of
his
motive
based
on
nothing
but
her
disbelief
in
an
affidavit
that
he
filed
is
not
sustainable
on
whatever
standard
of
review
may
be
applicable
here
given
that
this
is
a
first
amendment
case.
it
should
be
noted
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--because
the
question
of
whether
he
can
be
punished
for
having
made
a
statement
to
the
press
about
an
issue
of
paramount
public
importance.
judge
borck
in
another
recent
decision
which
is
cited
in
the
amici's
brief
has
noted
the
enormous
public
importance
about
the
safety
of
bendectin
at
that
point
in
time.
indeed,
it
was
only
four
months
later
that
bendectin
was
withdrawn
voluntarily
by--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i
am
saying
that
if
that
evidence
is
relevant
to
a
paramount
public
issue
which
far
transcends
this
lawsuit
as
the
safety
of
bendectin
does
and...
this
is
very
important.
i
don't
mean
to
say
lawyers
can
just,
whenever
evidence
is
ruled
inadmissible,
chuck
it
to
the
newspapers,
by
no
means,
but
when
that
evidence
is
relevant
to
issues
that
far
transcend
that
lawsuit
as
this
does
and
when
there
is
no
substantial
and
imminent
danger
that
it
is
going
to
reach
the
jury
in
the
case,
then,
yes,
indeed,
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
in
the
context
of
a
highly
visible
trial
where
the
whole
community
is
reading
the
paper
about
that
and
in
this
case
where
a
jury
hasn't
been
sworn
yet,
there
is
a
substantial
risk,
a
substantial
and
imminent
risk
that
that
disclosure
will
prevent
the
selection
of
a
jury.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
district
court
didn't
find
that
it
was.
the
district
court
didn't
care
what
the
impact
of
this
was
for
the
future.
she
was
just
mad
that
he
had
given
it
to
the
press.
none
of
the
relevant
inquiries
were
made
in
this
case
by
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
made
them
in
the
first
instance
and
said
they
really
aren't
susceptible
to
two
determinations
here.
this
was
not
going
to
prejudice
the
selection
of
a
neutral
jury
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
sure.
if
they
had
read
anything.
there
were
ten
questions
about--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no,
because
there
are
some
issues
of
such
importance
that
you
can
reasonably
assume
that
the
vast
majority
are
going
to
have
read
and
it
is
going
to
make
it
very
hard
to
find
a
jury
that
hasn't
seen
this.
that
was
not
the
case
with
this
disclosure.
indeed,
three
months
later
there
was
another
bendectin
trial
in
the
district.
not
a
single
member
of
the
jury
venire
had
read
a
single
article
about
bendectin
and
that
is
not
suprising.
i
must
confess--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--pardon?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
it
is
at
pages
323
to
324
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
voir
dire
questions
which
the
company
had
already
filed
in
this
case
which
plainly
showed
butler
the
question
that
were
going
to
be
asked
here
appear
at
pages
15
to
16
of
the
joint
appendix.
now,
let
me
please
move
to
appealability
in
my
remaining
time.
it
is
the
threshold
issue
in
this
case
and
i
think
it
is
terribly
important
that
we
say
why
this
case
is
different
from
flanagan.
it
is
different
in
two
ways.
number
one,
it
is
different
because
it
is
a
civil
case
and
not
a
criminal
case.
this
court
developed
the
three
coinfactors
in
civil
cases
and
it--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--sure.
in
a
particular
case
that
may
well
be
true.
and
the
reason
that
this--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
did
not
and
i
want
to
explain
why
that
doesn't
apply
here.
first,
the
coinfactors
developed
in
civil
cases
and
what
the
court
said
is
there
are
always
weights
on
the
scale
against
an
interlocutory
appeal,
heavy
weights.
but
then
over
the
years
certain
exceptions
developed
and
the
court
was
able
to
identify
that.
when
these
three
factors
are
present,
they
outweigh
the
interest
against
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
a
civil
case.
then
the
criminal
cases
came
and
as
flanagan
succinctly
demonstrates
the
weights
against
an
interlocutory
appeal
are
much,
much
heavier
in
a
criminal
case.
so,
the
same
factors
that
would
tip
the
scale
in
a
civil
case
aren't
sufficient
to
tip
it
in
a
criminal
case.
you
need
a
lot,
lot
more
and,
indeed,
there
have
been
very
few
instances
where
this
court
has
been
able
to
find
that
that
was
so.
the
second
thing
that
is
different...
and
this
is
key
i
think
to
this
appealability
case...
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
effective
review
of
the
disqualification
of
counsel
after
judgment
is
entered.
the
most
persuasive
demonstration
of
that
appears
in
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
gough
versus
perkowski
and
since
i
won't
have
time
to
lay
it
all
out
i
strongly
urge
the
court
to
read
that
before
deciding.
as
they
point
out,
what
would
the
issue
be
on
appeal?
the
issue
would
be
whether
the
disqualified
lawyer
would
have
gotten
a
better
result
for
the
client
than
the
lawyer
who
actually
tried
the
case.
that
is
not
like
any
other
prejudice
finding
courts
make.
ordinarily,
if
the
issue
is
whether
a
piece
of
evidence
was
improperly
admitted,
the
court
can
look
at
the
record
that
was
actually
made,
it
can
compare
it
to
the
record
as
it
would
have
been,
and
it
can...
it
is
not
easy,
but
it
can
determine
what
that
difference
is.
but,
in
this
area,
it
is
comparing
a
record
that
was
actually
made
to
a
total
unknown.
what
would
have
happened
if
the
other
lawyer
tried
the
case?
lawyers
aren't
fungible.
some
do
much
better
jobs
than
others.
how
would
that
lawyer
have
tried
the
case?
what
tactical
differences
would
have
been
made?
it
is
impossible
to
make
that
assessment.
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
uniformly
said...
not
a
one
has
ever
deviated
from
this...
we
are
not
competent
to
measure
prejudice
after
a
judgment
when
a
lawyer
has
been
disqualified.
we
can't
do
it.
the
ninth
circuit
considered
how
could
we
go
about
doing
it?
how
could
we
get
the
other
record
to
compare
what
actually
happened.
well,
they
said
we
could
have
a
post-judgment
motion
in
the
district
court
in
which
the
disqualified
lawyers
come
forward
and
show
how
they
would
have
tried
the
case.
now,
proposition
one,
who
is
going
to
make
this
post-judgment
motion?
not
the
disqualified
lawyers,
they
can't
do
it.
not
the
lawyer
who
tried
the
case.
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
show
that
it
should
have
been
done
better,
that
it
could
have
been
done
better.
so
now
the
client
is
off
to
hire
a
third
lawyer
to
make
this
post-judgment
thing.
now
the
lawyers
come
in
and
they
say
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
to
be
sure,
we
would
have
tried
this
case
in
an
entirely
different
way.
we
have
much
more
effective
jury
arguers,
we
are
much
more
articulate
in
the
way
we
present
it,
we
would
have
called
three
experts,
they
didn't.
we
would
have
done,
this,
that,
and
the
other.
the
defendant
is
going
to
come
running
in
saying,
oh,
no,
no,
if
they
had
done
that
that
wouldn't
have
affected
the
outcome
of
this
case.
we
are
going
to
generate
a
whole
second
trial
at
an
enormous
cost
in
judicial
resources
just
to
create
the
record
so
that
you
have
something
to
compare.
and
even
then
the
court
said
we
can't
compare
those
two
things.
how
can
we
sit
and
say,
yes,
if
lawyer
a
had
tried
this
case
instead
of
lawyer
b,
his
more
articulate
jury
argument
would
have
swayed
the
outcome.
it
is
unlike--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--the
court
here
implied
no
presumption,
your
honor.
the
court
here
said
a
wrong
was
committed
because
a
contract
freely
entered
into
between
two
parties
was
vitiated
without
justification
and
the
court
said
that
is
a
wrong
we
can
correct
now.
we
are
not
presuming
that
there
is
going
to
be--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
if
the
court
said
there
will
be
an
automatic
reversal,
it
would
affect--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i
guess
i
don't
know--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
i
guess
i
don't
know,
your
honor...
the
reason
it
is
hard
for
me
to
answer
that
is
that
i
don't
know
what
the
implications
of
the
presumption
of
prejudice
will
be.
if
the
presumption
will
be
overcome
by
arguments
by
the
other
side
that
say,
look,
this
is
a
good
lawyer,
why
should
we
think
he
did
any
less
or
any
better
than
the
first
one.
then
we
are
back
in
the
same
situation
every
court
of
appeals
is
talking
about.
we
are
guessing.
we
don't
know.
this
is
not
in
our
competence
to
measure
this.
that
is
why
anything
short
of
an
absolute
rule
that
says
you
reverse
if
this
happens
does
not
protect
the
client
against
the
very
serious
injury
that
a
different
outcome
may
be
obtained
and
it
will
never
be
detectable
after
the
fact
by
any
instrument
the
courts
of
appeals
can
use
to
measure
that.
i
would
point
out
one
other
thing,
one
terrible
consequence
of
that.
if
you
can't
get
a
post-judgment
appeal
because
the
courts
are
all
saying
they
won't
entertain
it
and
if
you
can't
get
a
pre-judgment
appeal,
there
will
never
be
the
articulation
of
what
standards
should
guide
district
courts
in
determining
whether
disqualification
is
proper
or
not.
every
district
court
will
be
a
barony
unto
itself
applying
whatever
standards
it
wants.
we
saw
that
happening
here.
this
district
court
applied
standards
that
everybody
concedes
are
wrong.
it
could
have
gone
on
doing
that
for
the
rest
of
its
career,
whenever
i
see
a
pro
hac
vice
lawyer
i
don't
like
i
am
going
to
disqualify
him.
and,
there
will
be
no
means
for
correction,
no
means
for
articulating
standards.
that
would
fuel
the
very
phenomenon
that
all
the
courts
are
talking
about,
the
tactical
abuses
of
motions
to
disqualify.
there
is
an
epidemic
of
this
now.
for
people
who
want
to
delay
a
trial,
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
is
to
file
a
motion
to
disqualify.
and,
if
the
district
courts
are
governed
by
any
definable
standards
in
ruling
on
those
motions,
everybody
is
going
to
have
an
incentive
to
do
that.
there
is
never
any
reason
to
think
you
will
lose.
how
do
we
know,
let's
try.
maybe
we
can
sell
this
idea
to
this
judge.
it
is
only
through
the
development
of
an
appellate
articulation
of
what
the
controlling
standards
are
that
we
can
ever
have
a
definition
of
what
district
courts
are
supposed
to
do
and
yet
if
this
court
says
there
are
no
interlocutory--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
cuts
against
flanagan
for
a
very
important
reason.
in
flanagan
nobody
has
got
a
motive
to
go
out
and
try
to
disqualify
lawyers.
prosecutors
want
to
get
their
cases
to
trial.
they
don't
want
to
delay
it
with
disqualification
motions.
but,
in
civil
cases
we
know
that
there
is
an
epidemic.
every
circuit
is
writing
about
this.
there
is
an
epidemic
of
disqualification
motions,
efforts
to
delay
trials
by
which
every
party
has
the
interest
in
doing
so.
and,
we
need
to
have
standards
to
prevent
that.
now,
the
other
part
of
flanagan
that
distinguishes
it
is
that
the
nature
of
the
claim
made
in
flanagan
was
different.
here
the
claim
is
the
district
court
has
taken
away
our
contract
without
justification.
sure,
it
is
subject
to
being
taken
away
if
disqualification
is
proper,
but
it
is
not
subject
to
be
taken
away
otherwise.
in
flanagan
the
claim
was
that
the
defendant's
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
and,
as
this
court
explained
very
succinctly
and
clearly,
it
was
an
element
of
that
claim
that
there
be
a
conviction
under
improper
circumstances.
the
claim,
in
other
words,
was
not
that
the
disqualification
itself
was
improper.
by
invoking
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
the
claim
was
i
am
not
going
to
get
a
trial
that
is
a
proper
trial.
because
that
was
so,
the
court
was
able
to
say
in
flanagan
the
second
criteria,
that
the
issue
decided
be
completely
separate
from
the
merits,
is
not
present
here
since
it
is
an
element
of
the
claim
you
are
advancing
that
you
ultimately
be
convicted
in
a
way
prejudiced
you.
in
our
case,
the
claim
being
made
is
different.
the
claim
is
we
had
a
contract.
in
our
free
society
we
were
entitled
to
proceed
with
that
contract.
i,
the
client,
was
entitled
to
have
this
lawyer
represent
me
and
there
was
a
consummated
wrong
when
the
district
court
vitiated
that
contract
without
cause.
we
don't
need
to
know
what
happens
at
the
trial.
to
know
that
if
the
district
court
did
not
have
grounds
for
disqualification
there
was
a
reversible
error.
thank
you.
