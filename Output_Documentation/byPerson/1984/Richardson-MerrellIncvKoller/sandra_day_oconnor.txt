mr.
walsh--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
guess
you
agree
that
it
is
difficult
to
establish
or
examine
the
question
of
prejudice
after
the
fact,
after
judgment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
an
interlocutory
appeal
is
not
proper,
but
then
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
you
have
this
issue
setting
there.
what
about
the
propriety
of
a
presumption
of
prejudice
at
that
time
so
that
the
burden
is
really
on
the
side
that
tries
the
disqualification
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
wanted
to
ask
you
that.
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
your
view,
even
at
the
interlocutory
stage,
apply
a
presumption
of
prejudice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
would
just
go
to
whether
an
interlocutory
appeal
is
proper.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
there
were
something
like
eight
lawyers
representing
the
client.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
lawyers
were
representing
the
client
otherwise?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gottesman,
i
assume
that
mr.
allis
wittingly
or
unwittingly
was
going
to
become
a
witness
in
the
trial
it
sounds
like.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
certainly
would
have
been
disqualified
on
that
ground
alone.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
any
event,
it
wasn't
decided
so
he
was
a
potential
witness
at
trial,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
an
order
of
disqualification
because
someone
is
a
prospective
witness
is
immediately
appealable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
was
correct
in
the
sixth
circuit
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gottesman,
do
you
think
it
is
possible
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
has
an
even
stronger
interest
in
being
represented
by
his
counsel
than
in
a
civil
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
didn't
prevent
the
court
from
finding
that
an
order
of
disqualification
of
counsel
was
not
immediately
appealable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
court
would
apply,
as
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
here,
a
presumption
of
prejudice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
i
read
it
differently.
but
assuming
there
is
a
presumption
of
prejudice
at
the
end,
does
that
affect
your
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
just
a
presumption
of
prejudice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
affects
the
burden
of
proof,
of
course.
justice
o'connor
of
course,
part
of
that
cuts
against
the
flanagan
rationale.
