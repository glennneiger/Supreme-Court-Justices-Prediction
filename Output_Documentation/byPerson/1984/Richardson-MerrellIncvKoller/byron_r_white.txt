well,
how
do
the
courts
of
appeals
stack
up
on
this
other
than

this
case?
justice

appealable.
justice
white
the
circuit
just
didn't
lie
down
and
say
flanagan,
they
thought
flanagan
was
right
or
wrong?
justice
white
how
about
your
old
circuit?
justice
white
so,
the
second
agrees
with
this
case?

white
