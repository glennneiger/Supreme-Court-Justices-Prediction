mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
reversed
an
order
disqualifying
two
los
angeles
lawyers
for
misconduct.
the
first
lawyer,
mr.
butler,
was
disqualified
on
a
finding
that
after
a
pre-trial...
after
a
series
of
pre-trial
orders
holding
certain
material
inadmissible
because
of
its
unfair,
prejudicial
nature,
and
after
the
venire
for
the
jury
with
which
this
case
was
going
to
be
tried
had
reported
to
the
courthouse,
he
released
this
material,
this
very
material
and
nothing
else,
to
a
single
correspondent
for
publication
in
washington's
leading
newspaper.
the
district
court
found
that
he
did
this
with
an
intent
to
circumvent
its
orders
and
to
prejudice
the
defendant.
allis
was
disqualified
on
a
finding
that
he
procured
a
statement
from
a
crucial
witness
into
an
investigation
of
fraud
on
the
court
with
an
intent
to
thwart
that
investigation.
these
findings
were
coupled
by
a
third
principal
finding
of
the
district
court;
that
the
removal
of
these
two
lawyers
would
not
leave
the
plaintiffs
unrepresentative
or
ineffectively
represented.
two
of
the
remaining
six
lawyers
are
leaders
in
the
bendectin
litigation
and
thy
third
is
mr.
jacob
stein,
a
former
president
of
the
bar
association
of
this
district
and
a
bar
leader
by
any
definition
who
lead
the
washington
back-up
team
for
these
plaintiffs.
one
further
point
before
i
come
to
the
question
of
appealability
and
that
is
that
the
removal
of
these
lawyers
occurred
not
during
the
trial
but
at
a
pre-trial
phase
where
there
would
have
been
any
adjustment
necessary
to
permit
the
remaining
counsel
to
absorb
the
full
load
of
the
case.
we
would
like
first
to
go
to
the
question
of
appealability.
at
the
time
the
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals,
flanagan
against
the
united
states
had
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
it
was
decided
a
year
ago
and
it
held
that
disqualification
of
counsel
orders
in
criminal
cases
are
not
appealable
prior
to
final
judgment.
there
are
two
halves
to
the
opinion
as
it
was
written.
the
first
half
sets
out
very
strongly
the
urgency
in
criminal
cases,
but
the
second
half
measures
disqualification
orders
against
the
standards
of
cohen
and
coopers
and
lybrand
and
concludes
that
by
their
nature
they
cannot
qualify
with
the
second
and
third
tests
of
the
trilogy
established
by
those
two
cases.
without
going
to
the
question
of
whether
a
disqualification
order
is
conclusive
assuming
that
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
as
the
court
did
in
flanagan.
it
leaves
the
question
is
the
order
entirely
separate
from
the
underlying
case
or
not
and
this
court
held
that
if
a
showing
of
prejudice
in
addition
to
error
is
needed.
it
is
not
entirely
separate
because
the
prejudice
would
require
and
examination
of
the
trial
record.
on
the
other
hand,
if
an
order
is
reversible
without
a
showing
of
prejudice
the
third
test
is
not
met
and
it
is
effectively
reviewable
after
judgment.
so,
it
seemed
as
soon
as
this
came
down
that
the
logic
projected
into
civil
cases
as
well
as
criminal
and
a
special
brief
was
filed
to
point
that
out
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it,
however,
disagreed
with
our
position
and
attempted
to
distinguish
this
court's
holding
in
flanagan
and
suggest
a
different
rule
for
civil
cases.
its
first
point...
incidentally,
its
discussion
of
this
begins
on
20a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
and
the
distinction
begins
on
29a.
its
first
point
was
that
if
in
a
civil
case
as
distinguished
from
a
criminal
case
to
reverse
a
judgment
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
that
the
error
was
prejudicial
and
that
to
show
prejudice
after
trial
in
a
civil
case
would
be
extremely
difficult
and
would,
according
to
the
court,
would
resolve
itself
into
competing
speculations
as
to
whether
lawyer
no.
1
would
have
tried
the
case
differently
from
lawyer
no.
2.
in
doing
this
it
went
back
to
holdings
of
courts
of
appeals
prior
to
flanagan
and
it
in
attempting
to
show
why
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
reach
a
decision
as
to
prejudice
after
final
judgment
in
a
civil
case
rather
than
a
criminal
case.
it
suggested
that
in
criminal
cases
there
is
experience
with
minimum
standards
of
effective
representation
and
that
that
type
of...
that
same
question
had
not
been
coming
up
in
civil
cases.
it
did
not
explain
why
that
was
so
esoteric
that
the
learning
in
the
criminal
side
couldn't
be
adapted
to
the
civil
side.
and,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
it
exaggerates
the
difficulty
of
reviewing
for
prejudice
after
judgment,
that
it
would
not
turn
on
a
speculative,
retrospective
comparison,
it
would
turn
on
whether
the
plaintiffs
were
able
to
get
lawyers
of
a
comparable
standing
with
those
they
lost.
the
holdings
of
this
court
prior
to
flanagan
have
made
clear
that
effectively
unreviewable
doesn't
mean
just
reviewable
with
difficulty.
it
means
truly
unreviewable.
that
was
a
holding
in
firestone
and
in
the
coopers
and
lybrand
where
they
contention
was
a
denial
of
class
action
treatment
will
make
it
financially
impossible
to
go
ahead
with
the
case.
the
court
said,
notwithstanding
that,
it
was
effectively
reviewable
and
that
the
problems
of
financing
the
case
would
not
be
accepted
as
a
substitute
for
meeting
the
cohen
trilogy.
and,
finally,
it
is
very
hard
to
show
a
difference
between
criminal
and
civil
cases
except
for
this
one
added
experience
that
have
been
had
in
criminal
cases
reviewing
minimum
effective
standards,
minimum
standards
for
effective
representation.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
courts
of
appeals
prior
to
flanagan
followed
the
fifth
circuit
in
duncan
against
merrill
lynch
and
all
said--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--they
said
it
was
appealable
because
of
the
difficulty
of
showing
prejudice
after
the
appeal.
but,
after
flanagan,
the
fifth
circuit
rejected
its
old
view
of
duncan
and
said
that
flanagan
had
changed
that
and
it
was
convinced
that
there
was
no
difference
between
civil
and
criminal
and
it
refused
to
follow
the
decision
of
the
court
itself.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
don't
know
whether
they
went
to
right
or
wrong
but
they...
judge
albert
rubin
said
it
should
be
followed
and
said
that
inasmuch
as
this
court
has
looked
at
orders
denying
disqualification
in
criminal
cases
and
orders
granting
disqualification
in
criminal
cases
and
orders
denying
disqualification
in
civil
cases
that
it
would
be
anomalous
to
say
that
this
should
be
a
different
rule
for
an
order
granting
disqualification.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
second
circuit...
the
first
case
that
came
up
they
said
this
raises
a
question
that
may
require
re-evaluation
of
our
earlier
holding.
the
second
case
said
we
are
going
to
stay
by
our
holding
until
the
supreme
court
tells
us
differently.
there
was
no
consideration
of
the
merits.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it
agrees
only
in
the
sense
that
it
won't
move
until
it
is
told.
it
did
not
itself
by
any
rational
process
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
koller
was
right.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
and
it
preceeded
koller.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
with
great
respect,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
a
problem
that
comes
with
many
kinds
of
error
besides
this.
there
is
a
certain
element
of
speculation
as
to
whether
any
error
is
prejudicial
or
not.
some
may
be
very
glaring,
but
it
is...
so,
there
is
a
problem
but
it
is
not
an
insurmountable
problem.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
could
be
a
feasible...
certainly
a
rational
position
to
reach.
if
it
goes
in
that
direction,
and
the
court
below
actually
seems
to
be
saying
that,
because
of
the--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--what
it
seemed
to
say...
what
it
says
actually...
i
refer
to
the
paragraph
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
the
31a.
what
it
said
was
that
we
don't
need
to
look
at
the
trial
to
see
whether
error
was
committed
here.
in
our
judgment,
the
error
is
clear
and
then
because
of
the
difficulty
of
proving
prejudice
it
seems
to
say
we
don't
have
to
prove
it,
but
then
that,
of
course,
brings
in
into
the
other
arm
of
the
dichotomy
of
flanagan;
that
if
prejudice
need
not
be
proven...
excuse
me,
i
misspoke.
if
prejudice
need
not
be
proven,
then,
of
course,
it
is
effectively
reviewable
after
final
judgment
and
there
is
no
excuse
for
interrupting
the
district
court--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
and,
one
more
point
on
that.
in
coopers
against
lybrand,
the
proposal
was
made
that
there
be
a
factual
evaluation
of
the
burdens.
and,
this
court
held
that
that
would
be
an
indiscriminate
standard
for
appealability;
that
appealability
couldn't
turn
on
such
fact
finding.
and,
the
court
below
will
get
into
that
same
box
if
it
tries
to
suggest
that
the
clarity
of
error
is
going
to
be
a
factor
in
determining
appealability,
that
first
you
must
see
the
error
clear
or
do
i
need
further
help
before
deciding
whether
a
case
is
appealable
before
judgment.
and,
the
same
concept,
if
adopted,
just
as
in
coopers
and
lybrand,
would
spread
to
other
types
of
pre-trial
orders
as
well
as
this
one.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
appealability,
i
will
go
briefly
to
the
merits
and
just
say
that
what
happened
here
is
that
notwithstanding
pullman
and
swint
and
other
cases
the
court
of
appeals,
as
it
says,
felt
that
the
findings
below
were
not
sufficiently
extensive
or
explicit
and
it
took
the
record
and
went
through
and
made
the
findings
it
would
have
found
if
it
were
trying
the
case
de
novo.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it
did
not,
justice
rehnquist,
it
did
not.
it
never
addressed
the
question
of
was
there
a
record
support
for
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
the
critical
findings
as
to
allis
was
one
of
intent.
did
he
do
what
he
did
with
an
intent
to
thwart
an
investigation?
this
turned
on
credibility
and
on
his
knowledge
at
the
time
he
did
what
he
did
and
his
credibility
as
a
witness.
and,
it
is
perfectly
clear
the
district
court
rejected
him
as
a
witness.
it
found
his
explanation
for
what
he
did,
the
conduct
of
a
true
investigation,
was
not
his
purpose
and
it
had
support
for
it
because
there
were
other
witnesses.
all
of
these
were
hostile
witnesses
to
the
defendant,
but
there
were
other
witnesses
who
testified
that,
indeed,
they
did
have
knowledge,
that
mr.
allis'
partner,
mr.
butler,
called
people
on
that
day
and
gave
them
the
message
that
allis
professes
not
to
have
had
knowledge
of.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
not
his
opponent's.
i
think
there
is
a
misconception
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
ms.
janowski,
the
witness
involved,
was
a
witness
for
the
defendant.
she
wasn't.
the
defendant
tried
to
insulate
itself
from
her
and
leave
her
available
for
the
court,
so
it
is
the
court's
witness
whose
future
is
being
thwarted
here.
and,
it
is
not
a
suggestion
that
any
time
a
witness
is
impeached...
it
is
a
mistake.
but,
on
all
the
circumstances
the
court
concluded
that
the
only
rationalization
for
what
he
did
so
quickly
and
in
the
form
of
the
statement
took
which
was
contrived
that
he
had
an
intent
to
thwart
the
investigation.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well,
to
the
extent
that
this
is
obstruction
of
justice
there
are
precedents
and
they
are
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
there
are
four
or
five
of
them.
they
are
more
dramatic
types
of
obstruction
like
getting
a
witness
to
leave
town
and
things
like
that.
but,
it
is
the
same--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--disqualification,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it
started
about
40
years
ago
with
about
a
100-year
history
in
conflicts
and
a
40-year
history
of
discreet
acts
of
misconduct.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
usually
it
has
been
used
with
discreet
acts
of
misconduct
whether
our
co-counsel
and
whether
out-of-town
lawyers
where
the
forum
only
has
one
contact
with
the
lawyer
in
question
and,
therefore,
less
of
a
reason
for
suggesting
going
to
the
bar
association
or
something
like
that.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
wouldn't
think
that,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--well,
i
won't
say
it
has
gotten
any
better,
but
this
was
unusual.
i
don't
think
this
had
ever
happened
to
any
of
us
before.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
don't
know
about
the
other
side,
but
i
think
that
they
also
were
reacting
to
an
unusual
situation,
but
the
question
was
where
one
side
tried
to
preserve
the
witness
involiate
for
the
court,
the
other
one
was
trying
to
destroy
the
usefulness
of
her
testimony.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
we
don't
urge
that.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
as
to
the
standard
of
misconduct
we
suggest
it
is
best
to
keep
that
the
same.
there
may
be
unusual
situations
i
haven't
seen,
but
the
standard
for
misconduct
should
be
the
same.
the
sanction
may
very
well
turn
on
the
relationship
between
the
forum
and
the
lawyer.
a
lawyer
who
is
here
for
one
case
only
is
dealt
with
by
taking
him
out
of
that
case.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
even
in
a
conflict
case.
if
the
lawyer
resisted,
there
would
be
some--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--it
did
not.
it
did
not.
and,
again,
this
goes,
i
think,
to
the
transient
relationship
between
the
lawyer
and
the
court
and
the
case.
coming
to
butler,
the
court
below
did
not
disturb
the
finding
as
to
intent.
that
stands.
nor
did
it
really
reach
the
question
of
misconduct.
it
held
that
even
if
all
of
these
things
were
so,
that
there
was
not
a
sufficient
effect
upon
the
underlying
case
to
justify
disqualification
and
that
that
should
be
restricted
to
truly
egregious
conduct.
now,
in
holding
that
mr.
butler's
conduct
was
not
truly
egregious,
the
court
looked
not
to
what
he
did
but
to
the
article
as
it
was
published
and
suggested
that
this
was,
indeed,
a
balanced
article.
well,
balance
depends
upon
a
definition.
if
you
take
a
very
strong
case
and
a
very
weak
case
and
make
them
look
equal,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
is
balanced.
but,
all
of
the
emotional,
heart-tugging
part
of
that
story
was
pro-plaintiff
and
anti-defendant.
and
the
worst
part
of
the
story
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
recognize
which
was
the
attribution
to
the
defendant
of
responsibility
for
thalidomide
which
crippled
thousands
of
children
in
europe
where
it
was
sold
by
german
and
english
pharmaceutical
companies.
now,
the
defendant
is
touched
by
thalidomide
because
it
had
licensed
it
and
was
testing
it
for
introduction
into
this
country.
at
the
time
its
teratogenicity
was
discovered
was
testing
immediately
stopped
and...
but
there
were
some
cases
that
arose
from
the
testing
program
which
were
settled.
there
other
cases
where
people
with
misfortunes
of
having
children
with
birth
defects
claimed
to
have
taken
thalidomide
and
those
cases
were
tried
out.
now,
mr.
butler
tried
one
of
those
cases
and
won
it
and
in
the
middle
of
this
story
is
this
discussion
of
how
he
won
a
case
for
a
legless
child
against
the
defendant
who
had
sold
thalidomide.
now,
it
is
not
only
a
devastating
reminder
of
a
20-year
old
tragedy,
but
it
is
a...
thalidomide
is
going
to
be
a
source
of
daily
discussion
in
the
trial
because
thalidomide
is
the
classic
teratogen
against
all
other
claims...
of
which
all
other
claims
of
teratogenicity
are
measured.
so,
it
is
not
as
though
it
is
going
to
be
a
forgotten
thing.
and
a
juror
who
has
read
the
story,
even
though
he
has
momentarily
forgotten
it,
this
is
all
going
to
come
back
as
this
horror
of
thalidomide
is
reiterated
on
an
almost
daily
basis.
for
those
reasons,
your
honor,
we...
it
was
really
the
butler
thing
that
impelled
our
petition
for
certiorari,
that
the
message
could
go
out
to
the
profession
that
it
is
not
sufficiently
egrecious
to
do
this
sort
of
thing;
that
if
you
don't
get
your
evidence
in
legitimately
you
can
use
a
newspaper
correspondent
to
do
it
with
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
would
waive
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
justice
stevens,
we
think
it
would.
i
think
prejudice
can't
be
measured
over
whether
one
question
more
was
asked
in
cross
examination
or
not,
but
with
mr.
stein,
who
incidentally
is
committed
for
the
full
commitment
to
these
plaintiffs--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--let
me
give
an
example
that
occurred
to
me,
mr.
justice,
where
i
think
there
could
be
a
problem.
if
a
person
from
new
york
with
not
such
a
good
case...
where
we
have
a
strong,
emotionally
charged
case
like
this,
there
would
be
no
trouble
getting
the
best
lawyers
in
the
country.
but,
supposing
it
was
a
weak
case
and
a
person
came
to
the
district
from
new
york
and
didn't
know
the
bar
and
one
thing
or
another
and
if
the
lawyer
who
came
down
is
a
friend
to
handle
the
case
was
disqualified,
then
i
could
see
a
problem.
in
that
kind
of
a
case
i
would
think...
it
goes
to
a
question
raised
in
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
concurrence
in
firestone,
that
a
court
would
reconsider.
there
is
nothing
that
forecloses
further
reconsideration
here.
if
mr.
stein
went
to
the
court
and
became
a
judge
and
others
went
to
the
department
of
justice
and
were
not
available,
even
though
the
district
judge
might
have
strong
reluctance
to
police
mr.
butler
for
a
12-week
trial,
i
think
there
would
be
a
basis
for
reconsideration
on
new
evidence,
but
that
is
the
example
i--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--i
don't
think
that.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
don't
mean
to
minimize
the
case
at
all.
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
