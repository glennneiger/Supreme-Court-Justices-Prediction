chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
thomas
against
union
carbide.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
lost
your
audience.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
and
you
can.
they
arise
out
of
a
contract,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
weinstein.
chief
justice
burger
what
about
parties,
as
justice
brennan
just
suggested,
who
consented
to
go
into
an
arbitration?
chief
justice
burger
were
they
forced
to
go
into
the
program?
chief
justice
burger
forced
to
enter
the
program
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
are
you
saying
that
if
the
government
sets
up
a
grant
program
of
some
kind,
hypothetically
now,
and
provides
that
all
disputes
between
these
private
parties
should
be
resolved
by
arbitration,
final
and
binding,
that
can
be
done
prospectively?
chief
justice
burger
well,
perhaps
i
haven't
made
my
hypothetical
clear.
but
when
the
parties
entered
the
program,
the
law
already
required
them
to
submit
as
one
of
the
conditions
of
participating
in
the
program,
the
arbitration.
in
your
case
you
say
that
was
sort
of
an
ex
post
facto.
chief
justice
burger
but
what
about
the
other
situation?
chief
justice
burger
have
you
come
across
a
court
of
appeals
opinion,
some
circuit,
i
don't
remember,
which
held
that
the
international
claims
commission
provision
of
final,
binding
conclusions
by
the
commission
was
valid?
chief
justice
burger
isn't
that
what
we
held
in
brayman
against
zapata?
chief
justice
burger
just
as
an
agency,
something
coming
from
the
federal
communications
commission
would
come
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
what
you
say
would
be
satisfactory.
chief
justice
burger
well,
it
might
involve
a
private
right.
it
might
involve
a
broadcaster's
license,
which
is
a
private
right.
but
that
is
the
kind
of
review
you
want
as
a
minimum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
burger
that
always
arises
out
of
a
contract,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
is
that
any
different
from
two
private
parties
agreeing
under
the
federal
arbitration
act?
chief
justice
burger
that
is
subject
to
review.
chief
justice
burger
now,
what
would
this
surgery
be
precisely,
if
you
will
restate
that?
chief
justice
burger
over
across
the
park
they
would
think
we
were
amending
their
statute,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
