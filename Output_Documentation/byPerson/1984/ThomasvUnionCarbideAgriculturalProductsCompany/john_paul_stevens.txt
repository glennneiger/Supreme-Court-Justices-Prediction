justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
are
you
suggesting
that
part
b
of
the
award
is
improper?
justice
stevens
well,
what
puzzles
me
about
that
footnote,
that
kind
of
assumes
there
is
a
law
to
be
applied
in
determining
the
amount,
and
i
don't
know
what
that
law
the
arbitrator
is
supposed
to
apply
is.
the
statute
doesn't
contain
any
standards
at
all,
does
it?
justice
stevens
it
was
that
part
of
your
brief
together
with
your
argument
that
made
me
wonder
whether
you
were
questioning
part
b
of
the
award.
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
you...
maybe
this
is
foreign
to
this
case,
but
i
would
be
very
much
interested
in
your
answer.
supposing
a
party
who
is
ordered
to
pay
an
award,
not
the
subsequent
data,
thinks
the
award
is
too
high,
and
doesn't
like
the
review
it
gets.
may
it
refuse
to
pay,
and
just
withdraw
its
registration?
or
is
it
committed,
so
that
it
has
to
pay?
justice
stevens
but
there
is
litigation
going
on
in
the
d.c.
courts,
is
there
not,
on
the
amount
of
the
award?
justice
stevens
your
position
in
that
case
is,
there
is
no
review?
justice
stevens
but
your
opponent
takes
a
different
view,
i
take
it.
justice
stevens
they
say
there
is
some
sort
of
review.
why
couldn't
you
in
that
case
say
we
disagree
with
that
entirely
but
file
something
in
the
nature
of
a
conditional
counterclaim
saying
that
if
there
is
in
fact
judicial
review,
we
want
our
$50
million?
justice
stevens
mr.
weinstein--
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
a
question
on
that?
supposing
there
were
standards
in
this
statute
that
were
perfectly
clear.
now,
maybe
that
is
impossible,
but
that
you
got
exactly
10
percent
of
your
labor
costs
in
submitting
data
or
something
by
a
readily
verifiable
record,
and
then
there
was
an
arbitration
award,
computed
the
10
percent,
and
that
is
it,
you
are
entitled
to
it.
would
you
be
aggrieved
because
that
was
not
done
by
an
article
3
judge?
justice
stevens
i
gave
you
one
where
there
is
law
to
apply.
justice
stevens
ten
percent
of
your
labor
costs
in--
justice
stevens
mr.
weinstein,
is
there
any
precedent
for
saying
that?
there
is
no
disclosure
of
the
trade
secrets,
and
they
are
being
used
by
a
public
agency
to
perform
a
public
function--
justice
stevens
--and
you
say
there
is
state
law
fixes
the
measure
of
compensation?
justice
stevens
what
issue
of
state
law?
justice
stevens
the
issue
is
how
much
to
pay,
and
you
say
that
is
an
issue
of
state
law?
justice
stevens
did
you
argue
that
before
the
arbitrator,
that
the
standard
was
fixed
by
state
law?
justice
stevens
can
you
cite
me
any
state
cases
that
have
remotely
discussed
this
issue?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
how
much
to
pay
when
you
use
somebody
else's
trade
secrets?
that
is,
when
a
public
body
uses
somebody
else's
trade
secrets
to
grant
a
subsequent
registration.
i
think
you
would
probably
have
some
trouble
finding
any
state
cases
that
discuss
this.
justice
stevens
where
they
get
access
to
the
material,
where
they
get
access
to
the
trade
secret.
there
are
a
lot
of
state
law
cases--
justice
stevens
--i
understand
what
the
court
said
in
monsanto.
i
am
just
puzzled
that
you
are
saying
there
are
state
cases
that
set
the
measure
of
compensation
in
this,
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
be
able
to
cite
me
any.
well,
don't
take
up
time.
