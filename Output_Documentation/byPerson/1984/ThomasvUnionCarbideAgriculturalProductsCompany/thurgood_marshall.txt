justice
marshall
it
is
your
position
that
you
have
a
right
to
question
b,
but
you
haven't
got
any
place
to
question
it,
any
forum.
justice
marshall
what
forum
are
you
going
to
question
it
in?
justice
marshall
well,
it
is
not
here.
justice
marshall
mr.
wallace.
justice
marshall
i
still
am
at
a
loss.
if
the
arbitrator
just
makes
an
obvious,
big
mistake,
what,
if
any,
remedy
do
we
have?
justice
marshall
the
statute
doesn't
tell
me
that.
justice
marshall
that
is
the
nearest
you
can
get
to
giving
some
relief?
justice
marshall
why
couldn't
you
call
it
an
arbitration
court,
c-o-u-r-t?
justice
marshall
and
if
it
was
an
arbitration
court
within
article
3
judge,
it
is
all
right?
justice
marshall
that's
what
i
said.
justice
marshall
the
only
thing
wrong
with
this
is,
it
is
not
called
a
court,
and
you
don't
have
an
article
3
judge.
those
are
the
only
two
things.
what
else
are
you
quarreling
with?
justice
marshall
well,
what
else
are
you
quarreling
about?
justice
marshall
what
else
do
you
complain
about?
justice
marshall
that
is
all
you
are
complaining
about?
justice
marshall
but
the
magistrate
are
not
article
3
judges.
justice
marshall
awful
close.

justice
marshall
you
are
not
giving
up
your
article
3
judge
now,
are
you?
justice
marshall
yes,
well,
you
have
mentioned
it
right
now.
you
are
not
giving
it
up?
justice
marshall
if
there
is
a
review,
it
must
be
before
an
article
3
judge.
justice
marshall
you
didn't
say
that.
justice
marshall
i
just
wondered
whether
you
had
given
it
up.
