justice
jr.
well,
mr.
wallace,
how
much
judicial
review
of
permitted
of
these
awards
from
the
statute?
justice
jr.
i
thought
the
statute
limited
it
to
fraud.
justice
jr.
i
don't
know
what
lindahl
has
got
to
do
with
this.
justice
jr.
he
is
just
bruised.
you
are
just
bruised,
are
you,
mr.
wallace?
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
jr.
a
little
broader
than
just
fraud.
justice
jr.
mr.
wallace,
what
about
other
forms
of
arbitration
such
as
under
the
federal
arbitration
act?
or
is
your
answer
that
those
are
all
voluntary
arbitrations?
justice
jr.
or
here
you
don't
have
to
go
into
this
system,
but
if
you
do,
then
you
are
stuck
with
arbitration
if
you
can't
agree.
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
does
that
make
a
distinction
from
the
article
3
argument?
what
about
the
national
labor
relations
act?
what
about
arbitrating
collective
bargaining
contract
disputes?
justice
jr.
those,
you
certainly
don't
go
into
court
every
time
you
lose
an
arbitration.
justice
jr.
would
you
press
your
article
3
argument
if
this
statute
permitted
some
judicial
review
of
the
arbitration
award
other
than
just
fraud,
misconduct,
and
so
forth?
justice
jr.
in
what
court
would
you
do
this?
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court?
