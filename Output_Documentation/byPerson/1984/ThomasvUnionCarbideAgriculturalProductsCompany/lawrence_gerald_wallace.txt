mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
follow-up
to
last
term's
decision
in
ruckelshaus
against
monsanto
company
in
which
this
court
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
data
use
and
disclosure
provisions
of
the
federal
statute
regulating
the
marketing
and
sale
of
pesticides,
known
as
fifra.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
data
involved
are
not
formulas
of
pesticide
products,
but
they
are
health
and
safety
testing
data,
and
those
are
used
by
epa
in
granting
registrations
to
subsequent
applicants.
under
the
statutory
scheme
they
are
not
required
to
duplicate
the
testings,
but
are
to
share
in
the
cost
of
generating
the
test
data.
there
is
no
issue
in
the
present
case
with
respect
to
public
disclosure
of
the
data.
that
portion
of
fifra
is
not
involved
here,
because
the
compensation
scheme
which
is
at
issue
does
not
relate
to
public
disclosure.
it
relates
only
to
use
of
the
data
within
epa
in
support
of
the
subsequent
application.
the
subsequent
applicant
is
not
given
access
to
the
data
for
that
purpose.
he
merely
cites
the
existence
of
such
data
from
an
index.
this
court
last
term
held
that
the
district
court
had
acted
prematurely
in
the
monsanto
case
in
holding
that
the
system
for
sharing
the
costs
of
generating
the
data,
the
system
of
compulsory
arbitration
that
is
provided
for
if
the
parties
cannot
reach
agreement
violated
article
3
of
the
constitution.
the
court
held
that
that
issue
was
not
ripe
for
review.
it
then
vacated
and
remanded
the
present
case,
and
the
district
court
held
that
that
issue
was
ripe
in
the
present
case,
and
that
those
provisions
did
violate
article
3,
and
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
entire
licensing,
if
one
might
call
it
that,
and
compensation
system
for
registering
subsequent
applicants,
and
the
case
is
on
appeal
from
that
holding.
now,
except
for
the
stauffer
chemical
company,
the
remaining
appellees
are
in
the
identical
situation
that
monsanto
was
in
last
term.
none
of
them
has
been
a
party
to
any
arbitration
proceeding,
and
their
situation
is
squarely
controlled
by
the
holding
that
the
issue
was
not
ripe
with
respect
to
monsanto.
and
our
first
contention
is
that
here,
too,
the
issue
is
not
ripe
for
adjudication,
but
we
also
have
contentions
on
the
merits
to
follow
through
with.
the
question
as
to
whether
it
is
ripe
with
respect
to
stauffer
chemical
company
is
only
a
little
more
complicated,
but
we
believe
that
the
same
result
should
follow.
stauffer
has
been
a
party
to
one
arbitration
proceeding
under
the
statute
against
ppg
industries,
but
stauffer
has
not
either
in
the
present
case
or
in
a
case
that
is
pending
between
the
two
companies
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
contested
the
result
of
that
arbitration
award
as
not
meeting
the
statutory
standard.
the
court
said
in
the
monsanto
case
that
the
operation
of
the
arbitration
procedure
affects
only
in
that
case
monsanto's
ability
to
vindicate
its
statutory
right
to
obtain
compensation.
it
is
ppg
which
claims
that
monsanto
has
been
overcompensated
by
the
arbitrator's
award,
and
while
monsanto
is
asking
that
the
entire
system
of
allowing
a
competitor
a
registration
be
struck
down
so
that
it
can
still
market
its
no
longer
patented
product
free
of
competition,
it
is
not
asking
that
the
award
be
set
aside
or
augmented
in
any
way.
presumably
this
is
a
tactical
decision
to
restrict
the
scope
of
review,
and
i
think
if
one
turns
to
the
award
itself,
one
can
understand
that
it
is
really
stauffer
that
has
won
the
award
for
all
practical
purposes,
and
at
least
is
taking
that
stance
in
the
proceedings.
i
should
point
out
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
on
remand,
and
this
is
printed
at
page
30
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
appellees
specifically
said
that
plaintiffs
do
not
in
this
case
challenge
the
result
of
an
arbitration,
nor
does
the
adjudication
of
plaintiff's
claims
depend
in
any
manner
on
the
outcome
of
an
arbitration.
and
in
the
case
pending
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
stauffer
is
asking
for
enforcement
of
the
award,
or
in
the
alternative,
that
ppg
not
be
allowed
to
market
the
product
at
all,
and
that
stauffer
be
awarded
damages
in
the
amount
of
the
arbitrator's
award.
the
award
is
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
if
one
turns
to
page
54
of
the
joint
appendix,
one
can
see
what
was
awarded
to
stauffer
by
the
arbitrators.
there
are
two
elements
to
the
award.
paragraph
a
awards
the
sum
of
$1,465,000,
which
is
explained
two
page
earlier
to
be
one-half
the
sum
of
$2,930,000,
which
was
the
cost
generated
in
getting
the
data
that
were
submitted
to
epa.
and
then
there
is
the
plus,
part
b,
running
compensation
for
the
calendar
years
1983
through
1992
of
15
cents
per
pound,
for
every
pound
of
product
that
ppg
sells,
and
there
is
a
fraction
there
which
is
intended
to
be
an
inflation
adjustment,
which
so
long
as
the
consumer
price
index
continues
to
rise
will
have
the
effect
of
increasing
the
15
cents
slightly.
and
on
the
preceding
page,
page
53,
the
arbitrators
estimated
that
during
the
first
five
years
of
that
ten-year
period,
ppg
would
sell
47,250,000
pounds.
if
one
multiplies
that
by
15
cents,
it
comes
to
about
$7
million,
and
that
is
only
for
the
first
five
of
the
ten
years.
obviously,
added
to
the
$1,465,000,
it
would
exceed
the
total
cost
of
generating
the
data
many
times
over.
now,
our
own
view
of
the
legislative
history
set
forth
on
page
4
of
the
reply
brief
that
we
have
filed
in
this
case
indicates
that
congress
was
quite
clear
that
it
meant
the
awards
in
these
cases
to
be
a
device
for
sharing
the
cost
of
generating
the
data
and
not
to
include
something
extraneous
which
is
really
in
the
nature
of
a
patent
royalty.
even
though
there
has
been
no
claim
that
a
patented
process
was
used
in
generating
these
test
data,
we
don't
know
of
any
instance
in
which
anyone
has
gotten
a
patent
on
any
process
used
in
generating
the
data.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
that
is
the
view
that
we
have
taken
about
what
the
proper
statutory
standard
is,
but
the
court...
i
am
not
saying
the
court
should
reach
that
question.
my
point
is
that
there
may
well
be
reason
why
stauffer
would
be
fearful
of
having
the
question
of
modifying
the
award
or
setting
it
aside
addressed
in
court,
because
stauffer,
while
it
made
a
larger
claim
to
the
arbitrators,
has
steadfastly
refrained
from
making
an
effort
to
set
aside
or
augment
the
award
in
any
court
because
it
would
imply
that
the
award
could
be
modified
in
the
other
direction.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
that
is
the
question
at
issue
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
case
between
stauffer
and
ppg,
and
we
have
not
taken
a
position
on
that
precise
question
yet.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
well,
we
thought
the
same
thing
in
a
case
decided
last
wednesday,
lindahl
against
the
office
of
personnel
management,
but
statutes
are
subject
to
construction
on
the
question
of
the
scope
of
judicial
review,
and--
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
--well,
it
was
a
construction
of
that
particular
statutory
provision.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
as
it
happens,
in
this
particular
arbitration
award,
the
arbitrators
themselves
suggested
a
scope
of
judicial
review
that
is
perhaps
debatable
under
this
statute
in
footnote
1
on
page
43
of
the
joint
appendix.
they
say
misconduct
within
the
meaning
of
the
judicial
review
provisions
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrators
can
include
their
acting
in
excess
of
their
powers
or
perversely
misconstruing
the
law,
which
would
suggest
some
review
of
legal
questions
in
a
reviewing
court.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
that
is
correct,
and
the
statute
does
say
that
the
awards
are
reviewable
only
for
fraud,
misrepresentation,
or
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
parties
or
the
arbitrators,
which
leaves--
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
--well,
we
have
pointed
out
on
page
4
of
our
reply
brief
that
the
legislative
history
seems
just
quite
clear
that
the
compensation
provision
is
intended
to
effect
an
equitable
sharing
of
the
costs
of
generating
the
data.
the
theory
of
the
statute
is
that
it
is
economically
inefficient
to
require
a
subsequent
application
for
a
registration
of
the
same
pesticide
to
have
to
go
through
the
whole
testing
procedure
over
again
and
incur
in
this
case
more
than
$2
million
of
costs.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
well,
what...
for
purposes
of
this
case,
obviously
the
accuracy
of
the
award
is
not
at
issue.
what
i
am
pointing
out
is
that
there
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
questioning
part
b
of
the
award,
that
it
seems
to
us
not
at
all
inadvertent
that
stauffer
has
not
sought
to
have
the
award
set
aside
or
modified
in
any
way,
and
is
steadfastly
taking
the
position
that
the
award
should
be
enforced
as
is
if
it
cannot
prevent
competition
altogether
within
the
statutory
scheme.
stauffer
has
not
in
any--
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
--well,
that
is
to
be
litigated
in
this
next
case.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
well,
that
is
now
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
justice
marshall.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
it
is
not
here,
no.
what
is
here
is
whether
stauffer
is
in
a
different
position
from
monsanto
last
term
with
respect
to
ripeness
of
the
article
3
issue,
and
stauffer
says,
yes,
they
have
suffered
injury
and
are
seeking
redress
for
that
injury
because
they
claimed
more
before
the
arbitrators
than
the
arbitrators
gave
them.
but
they
have
not
sought
to
upset
the
arbitrator's
award
either
in
this
case
or
in
the
case
where
they
have
an
opportunity
to
seek
to
do
that
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
they
are
standing
by
that
award.
the
only
possible
outcome
of
that
case
could
be
to
diminish
the
award
or
to
keep
the
award
as
it
is,
so
stauffer
is
not
taking
the
position
that
the
award
doesn't
fully
reflect
what
they
are
entitled
to
within
the
meaning
of
the
compensation
provision
of
the
statute.
so,
they
are
not
in
a
position
where
they
have
been
injured
by
an
award
and
are
seeking
redress
for
that
injury.
that
is
our
plight
on
ripeness.
their
position
is
really
no
different
from
monsanto's.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
well,
under
the
statute,
they
can
start
marketing
prior
to
the
resolution
of
the
compensation
issue,
so
they
can
market
once
they
have
the
registration,
and
if
they
have
made
an
offer
to
compensate,
no
matter
how
long
it
then
takes
to
resolve
the
amount
of
compensation.
and
if
they
have
entered
the
market
and
actually
sold
the
product,
i
think
it
would
be
hard
for
them
to
pull
back,
but
of
course
this
has
never
been
resolved.
this
particular
arbitration
award
is
the
only
one
that
has
occurred
so
far,
and
it
is
being
contested
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
so,
i
can't
really
give
you
a
definitive
answer.
if
they
had
not
yet
marketed
the
product,
if
they
had
just
gotten
a
registration,
i
don't
see
that
they
would
have
incurred
any
liability.
that
is
a
common
practice
that
people
are
getting
the
me-too
registrations
for
products
while
they
are
still
under
patent,
with
the
idea
of
being
ready,
having
the
federal
approval
to
market
the
product
when
the
patent
expires.
stauffer
had
a
patent
on
this
particular
product
which
has
expired,
and
ppg
is
marketing
the
product.
well,
factually,
the
case
is
obviously
a
little
different
from
previous
ripeness
cases
that
the
court
has
had,
but
we
think
it
falls
within
the
principle
that
this
kind
of
constitutional
challenge
should
not
be
heard
by
a
party
who
doesn't
show
injury
in
fact
and
isn't
seeking
redress
for
that
injury.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
that
is
our
position.
stauffer
has
to
be
taking
the
position
that
it
has
gotten
less
compensation
than
what
it
was
entitled
to.
the
point
of
the
ripeness
holding
was
that
perhaps
the
arbitration
would
meet
the
statutory
standard,
and
it
was
speculative
to
assume
that
it
would
not.
and
if
stauffer
is
not
in
court
taking
the
position
that
the
one
arbitration
it
has
had
did
not
meet
the
statutory
standard,
then
it
is
in
the
same
position
monsanto
is
in.
it
just
happens
that
it
had
an
arbitration.
that
is
our
point.
and
stauffer
has
refused
to
take
that
position,
even
though
it
has
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so
in
two
courts.
now,
beyond
the
fact
that
we
think
the
issue
is
not
ripe
for
review
in
this
case,
and
that
should
end
the
case,
in
the
event
the
court
or
some
members
of
the
court
may
disagree
with
us,
then
we
do
think
that
on
the
merits
the
district
court
erred,
and
that
there
is
nothing
incompatible
with
article
3
of
the
constitution
and
this
statutory
scheme.
in
our
view,
this
question
does
not
require
the
court
to
consider
the
broad
spectrum
of
issues
that
were
discussed
in
the
northern
pipeline
case.
this
case
falls
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum.
it
is
not
merely
that
the
case
does
not
involve
a
common
law
type
of
claim
under
state
law,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
this
case
not
only
involves
a
claim
only
under
a
federal
statute
creating
a
recently
claimed
right,
a
recently
created
right,
but
it
involves
a
relationship
between
the
two
parties
which
itself
would
not
exist
were
it
not
for
the
federal
statute.
the
very
relationship
between
the
two
parties
is
a
creature
of
the
federal
statute.
these
are
not
people
who
are
doing
business
with
one
another.
they
don't
have
a
relationship
that
could
give
rise
to
a
claim.
all
that
is
happening
is
that
they
are
competing
in
selling
an
unpatented
product
which
itself
would
not
give
rise
to
a
legal
claim.
the
nearest
analogy
would
be
under
a
state
law
of
unfair
competition,
but
obviously
it
cannot
violate
state
law
merely
to
compete
in
the
sale
of
an
unpatented
product.
the
federal
antitrust
laws
and
patent
laws
would
preclude
that
kind
of
a
state
law.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
well,
they
don't
fit
conveniently
into
either
of
those
labels.
the
right
immediately
at
issue
is
not
a
right
against
the
government,
which
is
the
way
the
public
rights
doctrine
was
described
in
northern
pipeline.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
only
the
government
that
is
using
the
testing
data
for
purposes
of
conferring
the
second
registration,
and
the
statutory
scheme
is
based
on
the
idea
that
the
public
will
benefit
from
competition,
that
the
public
health
and
safety
will
be
adequately
provided
for
without
duplication
of
the
testing,
if
the
testing
was
adequately
done
in
the
first
place,
but
that
the
innovator
who
went
through
the
testing
should
not
be
discouraged
from
that,
and
should
have
the
costs
shared
with
the
competing
registrant
who
is
going
to
enter
the
market
and
compete
against
him.
all
of
that
is
for
a
public
purpose,
and
the
duty
to
compensate
arises
wholly
from
the
statute,
and
the
use
of
the
data
arises
wholly
from
the
statute.
congress
could
have
said
that
once
we
have
registered
a
particular
pesticide
product
on
the
basis
of
test
data
by
the
innovator,
anyone
else
is
free
without
a
registration
to
market
that
product
so
long
as
it
isn't
patented.
congress
conditioned
the
ability
to
market
that
product
on
a
sharing
of
the
test
generating
costs,
and
that
is
the
sole
basis
for
the
claim
here.
it
is
a
creature
of
statute,
and
what
congress
conferred
on
the
original
applicant
was
the
right
to
get
a
share
of
those
costs
as
determined
by
the
arbitrators,
and
there
is
nothing
in
article
3
under
the
analysis
taken
in
any
of
the
opinions
in
northern
pipeline
that
precludes
that.
in
fact--
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
--well,
we
think
not.
we
think
that
it
instead
comes
squarely
within
the
exception
that
was
recognized
on
page
83
of
that
opinion
for
a
statutory
right
created
by
congress
which
prescribed
specific
remedies
and
provides
the
person
seeking
to
vindicate
that
right
must
do
so
before
particularized
tribunals,
and
it
goes
on
to
describe
that.
we
have
quoted
that
paragraph
on
pages
21
and
22
of
our
brief.
it
says
that
such
provisions
do,
in
a
sense,
affect
the
exercise
of
judicial
power,
but
they
are
also
incidental
to
congress's
power
to
define
the
right
that
it
has
created,
and
the
only
right
to
compensation
that
congress
created
here
was
the
right
either
to
agree
on
compensation
between
the
parties
or
to
get
it
from
this
tribunal
of
arbitrators
as
they
would
see
fit
to
equitably
divide
the
costs
of
generating
the
test
data.
and
both
parties
would
be
better
off
than
if
each
one
had
to
bear
the
cost
of
generating
such
test
data
on
their
own,
which
is
part
of
the
reason
that
congress
sought
to
confer
this
on
arbitrators.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
yes?
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
well,
the
government
hasn't
taken
a
position
on
that,
but
certainly
the
statute
is
capable
of
a
construction
that
that
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
that
is
to
be
resolved
in
this
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
well,
that
is
an
arguable
construction
of
what
misconduct
by
the
arbitrator
means.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
that
is
correct.
and
the
alternative,
of
course,
if
there
were
an
article
3
problem,
would
be
to
follow
the
mandate
of
the
severability
clause
and
to
eliminate
whatever
it
is
that
creates
the
article
3
problem.
now,
both
sides
of
this
litigation
agree
that
the
statute
is
severable.
the
appellees
agree
on
that
implicitly,
because
they
are
depending
on
fifra
to
prevent
their
competitors
from
marketing
their
product.
there
is
nothing
else
that
can
prevent
it.
they
just
want
to
sever
more
off
of
fifra
than
we
think
is
appropriate.
part
of
the
axiom
that
the
courts
are
to
save
rather
than
to
destroy
is
that
they
should
save
as
much
of
the
scheme
that
congress
preferred.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
i
would
say
so.
they
are
distinguishable
on
that
basis.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
--those--
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
they
arise
out
of
a
contract.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
they
were
not
forced
to
get
registrations,
but
of
course
they
are
commercially
valuable.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
if
it
please,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
difference
that
we
see
between
stauffer
and
marathon
with
respect
to
the
pipeness
issue
is
that
marathon
wanted
its
contract
claim
decided
by
another
tribunal,
whereas
stauffer
has
resisted
any
effort
to
get
a
redetermination
of
what
compensation
it
is
entitled
to.
it
is
defending
the
arbitrator's
award
with
respect
to
that
question.
it
still
wants
to
exclude
its
competitors
rather
than
accept
compensation,
but
is
not
attempting
to
get
to
the
question
of
what
compensation
the
statute
gives
it
a
right
to
decided
by
anyone
else.
now,
it
is
commonplace
for
tribunals
that
are
not
article
3
courts
to
make
monetary
awards
for
back
pay
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
workmen's
compensation
and
so
forth.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
these
are
claims
between
persons
where
there
is
a
claim
of
a
breach
of
rights
under
a
contract.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
i
am
not
speaking
of
arbitration.
i
am
speaking
of
a
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
itself
which
would
warrant
back
pay
to
someone.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
that
is
subject
to
review.
but
it
isn't
that
the
tribunal
making
the
determination
has
to
be
an
article
3
court.
if
there
is
any
article
3
problem
here
it
is
with
the
limitation
of
judicial
review,
and
the
statute
is
both
capable
of
a
saving
construction
or
of
severability
of
the
limitation
on
review
should
the
court
concluded
that
a
saving
construction
is
not
available.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
that
is
correct,
and
of
workmen's
compensation
decisions,
and
even
more
so
of
va
decisions
and
other
kinds,
but
the
point
is
that
there
is
no
need
to
describe
the
essence
of
the
scheme
that
congress
created.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
it
would
just
be
to
provide
for
as
extensive
judicial
review
as
would
be
required,
or
just
to
drop
the
provision
limiting
the
scope
of
judicial
review,
and
have
it
the
kind
of
judicial
review
that
existed
under
the
1972
act.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
it
would
be...
the
district
court
would
review
an
arbitration
award,
just
as
it
could
entertain
an
action
under
1331
to
enforce
an
arbitration
award.
mr.
lawrence
gerald
wallace
well,
it
amends
it
a
great
deal
more
to
do
what
the
district
court
did,
which
was
to
say
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
congress
intended,
that
competitors
cannot
market
these
unpatented
products
during
the
15-year
period
for
which
congress
provided
for
a
sharing
of
the
costs.
