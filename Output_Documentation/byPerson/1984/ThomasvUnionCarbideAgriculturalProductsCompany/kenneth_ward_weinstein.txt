mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
under
our
system
of
government,
it
is
the
courts,
not
arbitrators,
who
have
the
constitutional
responsibility
to
interpret
and
apply
the
law.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
i
think
that
is
a
distinguishable
situation,
because
here
the
appellees
have
not
consented.
they
have
been
forced
to
do
this.
the
statute--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--yes,
they
were
forced
because--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--in
the
first
place,
no,
but
the
statute
was
passed
after
my
clients
submitted
most
of
the
data
that
are
at
issue
here.
the
statute
was
passed
or
amended
in
1978.
that
is
when...
prior
to
1978,
we
had
appellate
review
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
i
would
suggest
that
it
cannot
be
done
prospectively.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
well,
the
other
situation
is
prospective,
and
i
would
submit
that
article
3
of
the
constitution
says
that
when
you
have
an
exercise
of
judicial
power,
whether
it
is
prospective
or
retrospective,
that
has
to
be
done
by
article
3
courts.
half
of
article
3
is
a
question
of
the
appellee's
right
to
an
article
3
tribunal,
but
the
other
half
is
a
question
of
separation
of
powers,
and
that
doesn't
depend
upon
whether
this
is
retrospective
or
prospective.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
a
jury
trial,
i
have
not
examined
whether
a
jury
trial
would--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--it
may
or
may
not
be
in
this
particular
situation.
but
the
right
to
an
article
3
adjudication
is
not
the
same
as
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
yes,
but
in
this
case
i
think
the
constitutional
right
that
we
are
discussing
is
article
3.
if
congress
can
prohibit
the
judiciary
from
deciding
money
claims--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--we
are
not...
i
don't
understand
the
question.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
jury
trial.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
yes.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
i
am
not
an
expert
on
the
seventh
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment,
but
i
believe
that
a
jury
trial
does
not
apply
to
all
actions
necessarily
that
the
federal
courts
have
cognizance
over,
and
we
are
not
asking--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--congress
may
be
able
to
do
that,
and
we
are
not
asking
for
a
jury
trial.
we
are
asking
for
an
adjudication
by
an
article
3
court.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
there
is
no
law
and
no
judicial
review.
this
is
an
exercise
of
judicial
power.
it
is
a
determination
of
legal
issues
and
factual
issues
by
an
arbitrator,
and
he
has
the
final
word.
article
3
of
the
constitution
says
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
is
vested
in
the
courts,
in
the
judiciary.
here,
we
have
congress
prohibiting
the
courts
from
deciding
legal
issues
or
factual
issues.
the
arbitrator
has
the
final
word.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
yes,
it
did
recognize
exceptions,
and--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--i
would
say
that
they
did
so
correctly,
that
the
plurality
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
it
is
a--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
correct,
that
the
right
arises
under
federal
law,
but
the
plurality
in
northern
pipeline
made
a
very
important
point.
it
said
there
are
two
principles
that
deal
with
federal
rights.
when
a
right
arises
under
federal
law,
it
is
clear
that
congress
has
a
lot
of
discretion
to
say
how
it
should
be
adjudicated,
but
the
second
point
was,
and
i
will
quote
from
the
opinion
in
northern
pipeline
on
page
81,
"second,
the
functions
of
the
adjunct
must
be
limited
in
such
a
way
that
the
essential
attributes
of
judicial
power
are
retained
in
the
article
3
courts.
"
what
the
court
said
in
northern
pipeline
was,
when
you
are
adjudicating
a
private
right,
for
example,
a
money
claim
between
individuals,
the
kind
of
claim
that
courts
historically
have
always
adjudicated,
the
liability
of
one
person
to
another
under
the
law,
that
is
a
private
right.
that
is
an
exercise
of
judicial
power,
and
it
must
be
decided
by
an
article
3
court.
but
when
congress
creates
that
right,
it
has
something
to
say
about
how
it
is
going
to
be
adjudicated,
and
it
can
specify
the
kind
of
tribunal,
but
article
3
says
that
the
ultimate
control,
the
essential
attributes
of
judicial
power
must
be
vested
in
the
article
3
court.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
you
could
if
they
were
article
3
judges.
the
problem
is
that
the
arbitrators
are
not.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
i
think
that
if
the
person
who
is
deciding
the
case
is
an
article
3
judge--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--then
i
think
you
have
an
article
3
court,
and
i
think
the
rights--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--justice
marshall,
that
is
of
very
major...
that
is
of
very
major
importance
that
these
are
not
article
3
judges.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
we
are
complaining--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--that
is
all
we
are
complaining
about,
that
we
have
no
right
to
an
article
3
judge,
and
if
i
may
illustrate
what
happened
in
this
stauffer
arbitration,
these
judges
are
appointed
at
the
whim
of
the
federal--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--the
magistrates
don't
have
final
power
to
decide
the
law.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
it
may
be,
but
there
is
still
an
article
3
judge
who
has
that
final
power
to
accept
or
not
accept
recommendations
from
the
magistrate.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
you
could
have
an
adjudication
of
money
claims,
and
they
may
very
well
and
do
involve
legal
issues.
for
example,
the
interpretation
of
this
statute.
what
is
the
standard
for
compensation?
that
is
a
legal
question.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
well,
if
it
did
that,
then
it
violates
article
1,
as
we
have
claimed.
there
has
to
be
some
standard,
some
intelligible
principle,
and
a
court
to
review
the
exercise
of
the
delegated
power.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
it
may
be.
it
may
be
an
adequate
standard,
but
who
knows
whether
that
is
the
standard
in
this
case
unless
there
is
an
article
3
judge
to
say
that
is
what
congress
intended,
and
we
leave
that
to
arbitrators.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
i
don't
think
it
is
what
congress
intended.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
saying.
we
are
saying--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--stauffer
is
very
much
complaining,
and
that
is
a
misdirection
that
i
think
is
totally
inaccurate.
the
district
court
below
found
that
stauffer
was
aggrieved
by
this
award.
the
award
was
$50
million
less
than
stauffer
asked
for
based
on
its
legal
theory
of
compensation.
what
the
problem
is,
this
is
the
only
remedy
that
stauffer
has,
this
suit.
it
can't
go
and
ask
for
judicial
review
of
an
arbitration
award.
the
statute
prohibits
judicial
review
of
arbitration
awards,
and
it
is
not
within
the
power
of
the
courts
to
judicially
create
a
remedy
that
congress
has
said
they
don't
want.
we
have
no
other
forum
but
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
that's
correct,
ppg
is
trying
to
set
the
award
aside.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
review
because
that
is
what
the
statute
says,
and
the
only
person
who
can
change
that
is
the
congress.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
they
take
a
different
view.
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
we
have
filed
a
conditional
counterclaim,
but
the
conditional
counterclaim
is
based
on
the
fact
that
there
is
no
judicial
review.
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
as
we
claim,
then
the
use
of
our
data
without
an
opportunity
to
be
compensated
in
an
article
3
court
is
invalid.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
we
have
sued
epa
in
this
suit.
this
suit
was
brought
prior
to
the
ppg-stauffer
litigation
to
enjoin
epa
from
using
appellees'
data
if
there
is
no
opportunity
to
obtain
compensation
in
an
article
3
court.
the
statute
says
that
if
data
are
used,
compensation
must
be
made
available
for
the
use.
if
there
is
no
compensation,
then
the
data
should
not
be
used.
it
is
a
simple
quid
pro
quo,
a
simple
principle
of
equity
that
congress
recognized.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
no,
we
do
not.
no,
we
simply
seek
to
prevent
the
government
from
using
data
if
there
is
no
compensation
in
a
constitutional
court
to
obtain
what
stauffer
and
the
other
appellees
are
entitled
to.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
but
this
case
is...
let
me
deal
with
one
issue
of
ripeness
and
justiciability,
and
get
that
out
of
the
way.
this
case
is
ripe
because
appellees
have
been
injured.
they
have
been
deprived
of
the
right
to
an
article
3
forum.
it
is
exactly
the
same
injury
that
marathon
pipeline
suffered
in
the
northern
pipeline
case.
marathon
was
forced
against
its
will
to
give
up
an
article
3
adjudication
of
state
law
rights
and
other
rights.
that
is
exactly
the
situation
we
are
in.
under
the
constitution,
nothing
more
than
this
is
required
to
have
a
justiciable
case
or
controversy.
we
are
not
depending
on
stauffer
for
ripeness.
but
even
if
we
were
depending
on
stauffer
for
ripeness,
stauffer
has
been
through
an
award,
and
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
was
not
contested
by
the
government
below
that
stauffer
was
aggrieved
by
a
$50
million
shortfall
in
the
award
and
by
the
absence
of
an
article
3
forum
in
which
to
obtain
compensation.
the
government
on
the
record
did
not
contest
that
stauffer
was
aggrieved.
now
it
is
trying
to
raise
the
argument,
but
i
don't
think
that's
right.
there
is
no
question
here
that
this
case
is
justiciable.
the
deprivation
of
a
right
to
an
article
3
forum
is
the
same
injury
that
marathon
suffered.
it
was
permitted
to
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
northern
pipeline,
and
we
are
in
the
same
position,
except
we
are
plaintiffs
instead
of
defendants,
and
that
is
the
injury
that
appellees
have
suffered.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
if
there
was
no
law
to
apply
whatsoever.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
if
there
is
law
to--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--if
there
is
law
to
apply,
then
i
believe
only
the
federal
courts,
the
judiciary
has
that
power,
the
final
power
under
the
constitution
to
say
what
the
law
is.
the
constitution
says
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
is
in
the
judiciary.
can
congress
take
that
power
to
declare
the
law
away
from
the
judiciary
and
put
it
entirely
in
arbitrators?
if
they
can
do
that,
then
that
independence
does
the
judiciary
have?
if
they
can
do
it
in
this
case,
it
can
be
done
in
other
cases.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
but
that
doesn't
help
my
clients,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
absolutely
they
cannot.
they
cannot
do
that.
we
have
researched
the
law
and
found
28
other
arbitration
statutes,
federal
statutes
that
deal
with
arbitration.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
i
do
not
recall
that,
chief
justice
burger.
but
of
these
28
statutes
that
involve
arbitration,
fifra
is
the
only
one...
chief
justice
burger,
that
statute
involved
consent
of
the
parties.
that
was
by
consent.
this
is
a
non-consensual
arbitration,
and
that
is
the
distinction
between
that
act
and
this.
but
of
these
28
other
laws,
fifra
is
the
only
one
that
mandates
arbitration
of
private
rights
and
that
prohibits
judicial
review,
the
only
one
of
all
28,
and
that
is
a
combination
that
we
would
submit
violates
article
3.
i
think
the
article
3--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--that
arises
under
contract.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
the
contract
is
entered
into
by
the
parties
voluntarily.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
that
where
it
is
done
voluntarily
i
don't
think
we
have
an
article
3
problem.
but
this
is
not
voluntary.
this
is
mandatory,
compulsory
arbitration.
the
parties
are
forced
into
it
retroactively.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
i
think
judicial
review
is
an
absolute
minimum.
the
court
held
in
northern
pipeline
in
the
plurality
opinion
that
more
than
mere
judicial
review
was
required.
in
northern
pipeline,
don't
forget
that
there
was
appellate
review
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
the
plurality
said
that
was
not
enough.
the
essential
attributes
of
judicial
power
have
to
be
in
an
article
3
court,
so
judicial
review
alone
is
not
enough.
there
is
a
more
important
reason.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
we
want
our
article
3
judge.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
yes.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
that
is
what
i
meant.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
if
there
is
a
review,
it
has
to
be
before
an
article
3
judge.
that
is
just
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
that
would
ordinarily
involve
a
public
right,
if
i
am
correct,
the
issues
that--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--we
want
the
same
kind
of
article
3
involvement
that
was
granted
in
northern
pipeline
in
the
plurality
decision,
which
was
that
the
essential
attributes
of
judicial
power,
whatever
those
are,
must
be
in
an
article
3
court,
not
in
arbitrators.
i
think
that
is
clearly
what
the
court
held
in
northern
pipeline.
this
situation
that
we
have
here
under
fifra
is
a
far
more
egregious
violation
of
article
3
than
what
we
had
in
northern
pipeline.
there
are
not
only
federal
rights
but
state
law
rights
that
are
being
adjudicated.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
in
the
arbitration,
the
arbitrators
are
deciding
how
much
money
is
owed
for
the
use
of
trade
secrets,
and
this
court
held
in
monsanto
that
the
extent
to
which
these
research
data
are
trade
secrets
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
arbitrators
are
adjudicating
that
issue,
that
is,
a
state
law
issue
and
a
state
right,
and
to
the
extent
that
we
have
trade
secrets,
we
may
be
entitled
to
more
compensation
for
that.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
it
is
correct
to
say
that
the
right
to
compensation
arises
under
fifra,
under
federal
law.
but
what
is
being
adjudicated
includes
state
law
rights,
these
trade
secrets.
the
government
has
not
disputed,
as
it
didn't
dispute
in
the
monsanto
case,
that
these
data
are
valuable
trade
secrets,
and
that
they
are
property.
this
is
the
subject
of
the
adjudication:
how
much
should
be
paid
for
the
use
of
trade
secrets?
that
is
a
state
law
issue,
just
like
in
northern
pipeline.
the
contract
that
was
being
adjudicated
was
a
state
law
issue.
the
arbitrators
are
adjudicating
under
a
federal
statute,
but
they
are
adjudicating
state
law,
trade
secrets.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
yes.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
i
say
that
the
adjudication
resolves
issues
of
state
law,
and
the
precedent--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--my--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--yes,
because
you
are
resolving
how
much
to
pay
for
the
use
of
a
trade
secret.
in
monsanto,
this
court
held
that
the
use,
not
the
disclosure,
but
the
use
of
these
trade
secrets
entitled
monsanto
to
a
fifth
amendment
taking
claim
for
just
compensation.
it
is
the
same
data
that
we
are
dealing
with
here,
the
same
trade
secrets.
they
are
being
used.
and
the
question
is,
how
much
do
you
pay
for
them?
that
is
an
issue
of
state
law.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
we
argued
that
the
standard
should
be
the
same
as
we
would
receive
in
a
state
law
proceeding,
which
was
the
value
of
the
right
to
use
the
trade
secret.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
state
cases--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--that
have
discussed
the
tissue
of--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--i
think
state
cases
discuss
the
issue
of
the
unauthorized
use
of
a
trade
secret
and
what
measure
of
compensation
they
should
be
entitled
to.
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
where
they
get
the
use...
the
use
is
what
is
important
here.
in
monsanto
this
court
said
the
use
of
the
trade
secret--
mr.
kenneth
ward
weinstein
--yes.
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
essential
point,
which
is
that
there
is
an
article
3
violation
here,
and
why
under
northern
pipeline
this
is
an
article
3
violation,
if
i
can
sum
that
up.
the
arbitration
system
here
completely
strips
the
article
3
courts
of
any
adjudicatory
power
over
this
decision.
the
arbitrators
have
full
authority
to
decide
all
matters
of
fact
and
law
in
the
adjudication
of
money
claims
which
in
crowell
versus
benson
and
in
northern
pipeline
this
court
held
to
be
a
matter
of
private
rights.
that
is
an
exercise
of
the
judicial
dower
of
the
united
states,
deciding
money
claims
for
the
use
of
trade
secrets.
i
would
like
to
deal
with
one
final
point
in
my
argument,
and
that
is,
assuming
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
that
the
article
3
defects
exist,
what
should
be
done
about
it?
our
position
here
is
not
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
require
the
licensing
of
these
data,
and
we
don't
say
that
congress
doesn't
have
a
lot
to
say
about
how
it
ought
to
be
adjudicated.
all
we
are
saying
is,
the
system
that
congress
enacted
here
transgresses
the
limits
of
article
3,
and
it
is
up
to
congress
to
find
a
way
to
do
it
that
is
consistent
with
article
3
and
that
meets
its
purposes.
we
are
not
trying
to
stop
the
application
of
this
law.
we
are
simply
saying
that
the
way
it
has
been
done
here
is
not
the
right
way.
to
comply
with
the
constitution
there
must
be
an
opportunity
for
an
article
3
adjudication.
but
that
can
only
be
done
by
restructuring
this
statute.
that
is
something
that
has
to
be
done
by
congress,
not
by
the
courts.
that
is
what
the
court
said
in
northern
pipeline.
epa
suggests
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
sever
parts
of
the
statute
that
offend
article
3.
the
court
rejected
that
in
northern
pipeline,
and
it
is
even
more
persuasively
rejected
here.
whether
you
sever
parts
of
the
statute
is
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
congress's
intent
was
expressed
very
clearly
here.
they
didn't
want
article
3
courts
involved
in
arbitrations.
that's
what
they
said.
they
were
trying
to
create
a
quick,
inexpensive,
simple
arbitration
record
without
appellate
review,
the
kind
that
traditionally
arbitration
provides.
they
said
in
the
statute
that
that
arbitration
is
binding
on
the
parties.
they
said
this
adjudication
is
final
and
conclusive,
and
no
court
or
official
of
any...
of
the
united
states
shall
review
it.
that
was
their
intent.
the
government
is
suggesting,
despite
that
intent,
why
don't
we
judicially
create
judicial
review
and
cram
it
on
top
of
an
arbitration?
that
is
exactly
what
congress
didn't
want.
that's
why
they
provided
for
arbitration.
they
said
no
court
review.
it
is
final
and
conclusive.
it
is
binding.
and
the
government
says,
well,
disregard
congress's
intent
and
cram
this
article
3
adjudication
on
top
of
an
arbitration.
let's
have
judicial
review
anyway,
despite
what
congress
said.
i
submit
that
severability
is
a
question
of
congressional
intent,
and
the
intent
here
is
not
to
have
article
3
review
with
arbitration.
now,
how
do
you
restructure
it?
there
are
lots
of
ways
that
congress
can
do
this.
they
can
create
an
adjunct.
they
can
get
rid
of
arbitration.
in
1982
they
decided,
let's
do
away
with
compensation
altogether.
that
bill
was
passed
by
the
house
of
representatives.
let's
have
other
ways
of
providing
protection
for
proprietary
information.
there
are
lots
of
ways
to
do
this.
it
is
up
to
congress
to
decide
what
is
the
best
way
to
meet
its
purposes
in
a
manner
consistent
with
article
3,
but
this
system,
which
bypasses
the
courts
completely
and
lets
arbitrators
decide
questions
of
law
is
not
the
right
way
to
do
it.
it
is
not
a
permissible
way
to
do
it.
thank
you.
