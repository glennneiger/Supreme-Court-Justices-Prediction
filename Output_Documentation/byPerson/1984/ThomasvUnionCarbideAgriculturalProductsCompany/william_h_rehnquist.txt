justice
rehnquist
well,
it
is
really
not
a
question
of
lack
of
ripeness
as
to
stauffer.
stauffer
can
never
challenge
if
it
does
what
you
say
it
has
done
here,
asks
to
have
the
award
confirmed.
justice
rehnquist
how
much
law
is
there
in
a
case
like
this?
maybe
congress
intended
just
to
set
up
kind
of
a
civil
law
system
for
adjusting
these
kinds
of
claims,
through
kind
of
good
conscience,
equity,
not
any
big,
black
letter
law,
but
just
let
three
arbitrators
decide
what
seems
to
be
fair.
now,
there
is
no
reason
congress
couldn't
establish
that
kind
of
system
of
dispute
adjudication,
is
there?
justice
rehnquist
maybe
congress
really
didn't
intend
to
have
much
of
a
standard.
maybe
it
just
intended
to
turn
the
arbitrators
lose.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
congress
said
in
so
many
words,
we
instruct
the
arbitrators
to
decide
as
justice
and
equity
may
indicate?
is
that
an
adequate
standard?
justice
rehnquist
you
insist
on
imprisoning
this
whole
thing
within
a
framework
of
article
3
judges
when
maybe
that
isn't
what
congress
intended.
justice
rehnquist
why
is
that
use
invalid?
is
your
claim
against
the
government
or
against
ppg?
justice
rehnquist
well,
your
claim
then
is
strictly
statutory.
you
don't
have
a
just
compensation
claim
under
the
constitution
against
the
government.
justice
rehnquist
--well,
we
still
get
life
tenure.

justice
rehnquist
what
about
the
federal
arbitration
act?
justice
rehnquist
congress
can
enforce
a
contract
to
arbitrate,
but
can't
impose
arbitration
unilaterally?
justice
rehnquist
what
state
law
rights
are
being
adjudicated?
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
at
least
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
rights
that
are
being
sued
over
here
are
purely
creatures
of
congress.
