justice
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
would
you
characterize
the
rights
of
the
claimants
here
as
public
or
private
rights?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
these
lock
like
the
kind
of
private
federally
created
rights
that
require
adjudication
as
to
law
and
procedural
issues
in
article
3
courts
as
suggested
in
the
north
pipeline
plurality
opinion?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
weinstein,
even
the
plurality
in
northern
pipeline
recognized
some
exceptions
to
the
requirement
for
article
3
courts,
did
it
not?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
it
did
so
correctly?
justice
o'connor
all
right.
then
do
you
think
that
this
situation
might
fit
within
the
language
read
by
mr.
wallace
of
being
a
congressionally
created
statutory
right
at
issue
here?
justice
o'connor
in
which
congress
has
provided
that
it
will
be
resolved
in
a
particularized
tribunal?
justice
o'connor
why
is
this
any
more
ripe
for
decision
than
monsanto
last
year,
because
stauffer
is
not
complaining?
