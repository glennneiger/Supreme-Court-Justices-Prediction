justice
white
these
people
weren't
forced
to
do
this.
justice
white
well,
say
you
win
here.
say
you
win,
your
view
prevails.
do
you
think
you
would
then...
do
you
think
congress
could
deprive
you
of
a
jury
trial?
justice
white
well,
that
is
a
constitutional
right.
justice
white
well,
it
is...
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
says
you
are
going
to
have
your
facts
determined
by
a
particular
tribunal,
tribunals.
justice
white
an
article
3
court
composed
like
same
other...
like
some
other
provision
requires
it
to
be
composed?
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
seventh
amendment
requires
a
jury
trial?
justice
white
well,
you
are
asking
for
an
article
3
court--
justice
white
--and
an
article
3
court
in
a
civil
case
is,
whoever
wants
it
gets
a
jury
trial.
justice
white
it
is
because
congress
can
define
a
statutory
right,
a
special
right,
and
assign
it
to
a
particular
agency
that
doesn't
give
jury
trials.
justice
white
you
are
saying
if
they
did
intend
it,
it
is
invalid.
justice
white
do
you
think
congress
and
the
statute
can't
delegate
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
with
the
power
to
adjudicate
in
an
administrative
agency
and
say
that...
give
the
agency
some
standards,
and
then
say
that
their
determination
shall
not
be
subject
to
any
judicial
review?
it
is
entirely...
we
are
going
to
put
this
entirely
within
the
agency
discretion.
justice
white
and
there
is
limited
judicial
review
of
nlrb
decisions.
