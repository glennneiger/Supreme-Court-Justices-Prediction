but
doesn't
the
very
paucity
of
language,
mr.
shapiro,
suggest
that
the
states
were
given
very
wide
latitude;
that
all
congress
was
interested
in
was
state
approval?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
connecticut,
mr.
shapiro,
had
simply
adopted
a
statute
that
said
we
will
allow
out-of-state
banks
to
come
in
so
long
as
the
state
in
which
the
bank
is
incorporated
allows
our
bank
to
come
in...
just
simple
reciprocity
without
the
new
england
regional
aspect?
justice
rehnquist
aaa
competition,
not
the
major
leagues.
justice
rehnquist
however
we
decide
the
case,
we're
leaving
it
to
congress.
