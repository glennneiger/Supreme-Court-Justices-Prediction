mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
regional
banking
laws
enacted
by
the
states
of
connecticut
and
massachusetts
which
permit
new
england
bank
holding
companies
to
enter
those
states
and
engage
in
full
service
commercial
banking,
but
which
withhold
that
same
right
from
bank
holding
companies
located
in
other
sister
states.
the
first
question
presented
is
whether
the
douglas
amendment
to
the
bank
holding
company
act
immunizes
the
statutes
from
scrutiny
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
second
question
is
whether
these
laws
are
part
of
an
agreement
among
the
states
which
requires
congress'
approval
under
the
compact
clause
of
the
constitution.
and
after
briefly
describing
these
statutes,
i'd
like
to
address
all
of
these
questions.
the
massachusetts
and
connecticut
laws
permit
companies
from
six
designated
new
england
states
to
enter
those
states
and
engage
in
full
service
commercial
banking
if
the
other
new
england
state
extends
reciprocity
to
connecticut
and
massachusetts.
these
regional
laws
operate
in
combination
with
another
regional
law
enacted
by
the
state
of
rhode
island,
and
together
they
set
up
a
multistate
common
market
which
permits
some
companies
to
come
in
and
denies
that
same
right
to
other
companies
based
solely
on
the
location
or
the
state
origin
of
those
other
companies.
thus,
some
companies
in
some
states
get
important
competitive
benefits
which
are
withheld
from
other
companies
based
solely
on
geography
or
state
of
origin.
now,
these
statutes
in
new
england
were
designed
to
permit
regional
expansion
of
bank
holding
companies
in
new
england
while
excluding
companies
from
the
neighboring
state
of
new
york,
regardless
of
their
proximity
to
new
england
and
regardless
of
their
size.
by
the
same
token,
companies
that
are
in
new
england
such
as
petitioner
northeast
bancorp,
are
unable
to
merger
with
banks
located
directly
across
the
new
york
border.
the
practical
impact
of
these
laws
can
be
illustrated
with
a
simple
example.
before
passage
of
these
laws,
companies
in
massachusetts
and
in
new
york
competed
on
an
equal
basis
for
business
in
connecticut.
each
could
offer
full
service
commercial
banking
in
its
home
state,
but
neither
could
offer
full
service
commercial
banking
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
now,
however,
massachusetts
companies
can
have
full
service
banks
both
in
their
own
home
state
and
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
while
their
direct
competitors
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
still
limited
to
their
one
home
state.
as
the
court
is
aware,
these
regionally
discriminatory
laws
are
not
an
isolated
phenomenon.
new
york
is
flanked
by
the
new
england
laws
on
the
east,
and
directly
to
the
south
its
neighbors
are
in
the
process
of
forming
another
exclusionary
market,
the
mid-atlantic
market.
and
there
is
a
similar
combination
of
states
in
the
southeast
which
also
excludes
the
state
of
new
york.
we
are
thus
witnessing
a
partitioning
of
the
entire
east
coast
into
exclusive
banking
zones,
and
as
the
court
is
aware,
some
other...
some
20
other
states
are
in
the
process
of
considering
regionally
exclusive
banking
laws
which
would
divide
the
countries
into
other
regions
throughout
the
entire
nation.
now,
as
the
solicitor
general
and
the
board
have
acknowledged
and
the
other
respondents
do
not
dispute,
these
laws
would
violate
the
commerce
clause
unless
approved
by
congress.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
eisenberg
farm
case,
and
i
quote,
"the
united
states
could
not
exist
as
a
nation
if
each
of
them
were
to
have
the
power
to
discriminate
as
against
sister
states
with
respect
to
admitting
articles
of
commerce.
"
"and
when
combinations
of
states
jointly
impose
this
kind
of
discrimination
in
unison,
the
danger
of
injury
and
divisiveness
and
retaliation
is
even
greater.
"
now,
where
there
is
this
kind
of
a
threat
to
the
core
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause,
this
court's
decisions
require
proof
that
congress
unmistakably
gave
its
consent
to
otherwise
invalid
state
legislation.
and
that,
we
say,
is
a
burden
which
respondents
cannot
sustain
in
this
proceeding.
the
solicitor
general
on
the
one
hand
has
made
the
argument
that
the
plain
language
of
the
douglas
amendment
permits
this
kind
of
discrimination
among
sister
states.
but
all
that
the
douglas
amendment
says
is
that
the
board
may
not
approve
an
acquisition
unless
there
is
a
state
law
in
existence
which
permits
the
acquisition.
it
doesn't
say
a
single
word
about
the
various
kinds
of
laws
which
a
state
might
adopt,
and
it
certainly
doesn't
say
that
a
state
in
lifting
the
federal
ban
is
free
to
pick
and
choose
among
sister
states
or
to
join
into
a
regional
confederation
which
sets
up
a
preferential
trade
zone
for
some
states
and
excludes
the
others.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
when
congress
defers
to
the
states
in
this
manner
with
general
language
of
this
sort,
the
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
presumption
is
that
congress
means
to
defer
to
constitutionally
valid
state
law;
and
when
it
refers
to
state
law
in
these
very
general
terms,
the
negative
ingredients
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
state
law
to
which
congress
has
deferred.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
a
very
important
question,
and
the
distinction
is
between
night
and
day;
and
let
me
explain
that.
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
the
statute
explicitly
says
not
only
that
the
states
may
regulate,
but
that
the
silence
of
congress
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
any
barrier
to
regulation
or
taxation
of
insurance
within
the
state.
and
the
legislative
history,
of
course,
was
that
this
was
an
area
that
traditionally
had
not
been
treated
as
part
of
commerce.
and
then
in
1944
this
court
changed
the
construction
on
that
question,
and
all
of
a
sudden
state
laws
across
the
country
were
exposed
to
commerce
clause
challenge.
congress
acted
within
one
year
to
pass
this
law
which
expressly
stated
that
it
was
lifting
the
negative
implications
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
so
you
have
unmistakable
language,
and
you
have
unmistakable
language
in
the
legislative
history.
and
we
say
there
is
nothing
remotely
resembling
that
in
the
douglas
amendment.
now,
our
brothers,
the
private
respondents,
have
made
the
somewhat
different
argument
here
on
the
authorization
point,
that
congress'
division
of
the
banking
industry
along
state
lines
is
such
a
splintering
or
such
a
balkanization
that
the
states
should
be
free
to
pick
and
choose
among
sister
states
and
set
up
their
own
regional
lines.
but
this
also
is
directly
in
the
teeth
of
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
in
the
bacchus
case,
decided
only
last
term,
federal
law
had
balkanized
the
entire
industry
along
state
lines,
had
given
the
states
plenary
power
to
permit
or
not
permit
the
importation
of
liquor,
and
yet
that
was
not
sufficient
to
displace
the
requirements
of
the
commerce
clause
with
respect
to
discriminatory
state
taxation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
if
the
douglas
amendment
such
as
s.
2851,
the
bill
that
was
considered
by
congress,
said
that
a
state
may
pick
and
choose
among
sister
states,
there
would
be
no
commerce
clause
issue.
if
a
group
of
states
tried
to
do
it
jointly
without
congress'
approval,
there
would
be
a
compact
issue.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
turns
on
the
specific
language
of
the
douglas
amendment.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
commerce
clause
issue
does
turn
on
the
meaning
of
the
douglas
amendment,
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
it's
an
issue
of
intent.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if
they
didn't
intend
to
permit
the
states
to
pick
and
choose
and
to
gang
up
against
their
sister
states,
then
there
is
a
black
letter
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
now,
the
reason
for
not
inferring
authorization--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
have
reinserted
that
issue--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
correct.
[laughter]
your
honor
is
quite
right.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
think
for
the
reasons
that
we
explained
in
our
supplemental
brief
that
they
clearly
do
not,
and
we
have
suggested
that
the
court
may
wish
to
consider
this
issue.
it's,
of
course,
a
discretionary
proposition.
but
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
on
either
the
commerce
clause
or
the
compact
clause,
there
is
no
reason
to
reach
equal
protection.
should
it
disagree
with
us
on
the
first
two
issues,
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
appropriate
to
turn
to
equal
protection,
the
reason
being
that
states
across
the
country
are
now
considering
statutes
of
this
sort,
and
many,
many
transactions
will
turn
on
the
validity
of
these
laws.
that
is
why
we've
raised
this
equal
protection
issue
in
light
of
metropolitan
life
as
a
discretionary
matter
for
the
court.
now,
to
return
to
authorization,
the
reason
for
not
inferring
authorization
from
congress'
regulatory
pattern,
the
balkanization
by
congress,
is
a
compelling
one
that
goes
to
the
very
structure
of
our
system
of
government.
when
congress
regulates
a
market,
it
acts
to
protect
all
affected
interests
and
all
affected
states.
but
when
a
group
of
states
imposes
its
own
discriminatory
system,
there
is
a
real
danger
that
unrepresented
interests
will
suffer
serious
harm
without
any
means
to
protect
themselves.
and
the
court,
we
say,
should
be
especially
cautious
about
inferring
authorization
for
regional
discrimination
from
this
douglas
amendment.
the
douglas
amendments
preserves
the
equal
status
of
each
state,
and
it
rests
on
historical
state
boundaries,
not
on
newly
conceived
regional
lines.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
ban
would
certainly
be
back
in
place
unless
and
until--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--unless
and
until
the
state
enacted
a
constitutional
statute
lifting
the
ban,
there
would
be
no
acquisition.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
these
states--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--these
states
have
enacted
laws
that
purport
to
give
consent,
but
they're
unconstitutional
laws
that
have
no
blessing
from
the
douglas
amendment.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
there
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
the
commerce
clause
contains
a
rule
of
constitutional
law
that
is
of
assistance
to
the
court
in
construing
what
the
douglas
amendment
means,
what
it
admits
to
allow.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that's--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it's
very
close
to
what
we're
arguing,
but
our
position
i
suppose
is
slightly
different
in
this
sense.
the
states
are
free
to
enact
statutes
of
any
kind
that
they
want
to.
they
have
general
legislative
power.
and
the
question
under
the
douglas
amendment
is
if
they
have
enacted
a
valid
statute,
that
lifts
the
ban.
now,
if
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional
under
commerce
clause
principles,
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
permitted
this
exceptional
result.
and
we
say
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
quite
correct.
these
orders
of
the
board
would
have
to
be
reversed
in
that
instance,
and
these
transactions
could
not
proceed,
and
my
clients
would
be
spared
the
competitive
injury
that
they
now
stand
to
suffer.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we're
not
far
apart,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
commerce
clause
contains
a
rule
of
interpretation
that
is
relevant
to
the
statutory
issue.
that's
the
only
difference
between
us.
the
wunnicke
case
and
sporhase
and
others
have
said
that
the
commerce
clause
means
that
you
have
to
have
unmistakable
evidence
of
consent
to
permit
this
kind
of
discrimination,
and
we
say
that
our
brothers
can't
find
that
unmistakable
consent.
now,
they
tried
to
find
this
unmistakable
consent
from
the
legislative
history,
and
the
court
has
warned
against
reliance
on
fragments
from
the
legislative
history
to
reach
issues
such
as
consent.
but
there
is
no
question
that
this
legislative
history
does
refer
to
state
discretion
and
to
state
policy
and
certainly
supports
the
view
that
the
states
may
lift
the
federal
ban.
but
it
doesn't
say
a
single
word
about
the
right
of
the
states
to
pick
and
choose
among
sister
states
or
to
enter
into
multistate
exclusive
banking
federations,
and
it
doesn't
say
a
single
word
about
relinquishing
the
protection
of
the
commerce
clause.
now,
respondents
also
have
made
the
argument
here
that
the
board
was
entitled
to
deference
when
it
addressed
the
issue
of
authorization,
but
the
board
made
specific
findings
about
its
own
statute
which
we
say
completely
undercut
respondent's
submissions.
the
board
found
that
the
douglas
amendment
"does
not
appear
on
its
face
to
authorize
discrimination
based
on
state
location.
"
and
that
the
legislative
history
contains
"no
discussion
of
the
power
of
the
states
to
discriminate
against
potential
out
of
state
interests.
"
now,
the
board
did
say,
of
course,
that
the
douglas
amendment
is
a
renunciation
of
all
federal
interest
in
the
subject
of
interstate
bank
acquisitions.
but
with
great
respect
to
my
friends
at
the
board,
this
is
certainly
an
erroneous
overstatement.
federal
law
prescribes
a
host
of
statutory
criteria
and
policies
applicable
to
interstate
bank
acquisitions.
in
this
very
case
the
board
had
to
look
at
competition,
potential
competition,
managerial
resources,
service
to
the
community
and
other
standards
prescribed
by
congress.
and
besides
this,
even
if
there
were
a
total
retreat
from
the
field
by
the
federal
government,
which
there
certainly
isn't,
it
would
be
beside
the
point
because
when
congress
retreats
and
defers
to
state
law,
it
is
deferring
to
valid
state
law
consistent
with
the
principles
of
the
commerce
clause,
as
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
in
recent
terms.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
board--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--they
said
they
were
waiting
for
judicial
clarification.
they
did
not
know
how
to
analyze
this
in
light
of
existing--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
the
rationale
was
this
renunciation
theory
which,
with
great
respect,
is
totally
in
error.
there
is
no
renunciation
of
federal--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--on
this
theory
of
renunciation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
silence--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--silence,
under
this
court's
opinions,
is
certainly
not
sufficient.
the
unmistakable
intent
on
congress'
part
to
permit
this
extraordinary
result,
a
result
which
this
court
has
said
is
destructive
to
the
very
fabric
of
the
union.
states
picking
and
choosing
among
sister
states,
provoking
retaliation--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
the
silence--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
silence
of
the
statute
on
the
issue
of
picking
and
choosing
means
that
there
is
no
unmistakable
intent
that
congress
meant
to
permit
something
like
this,
completely
destructive
of
principles
that
the
founding
fathers
were
concerned
about.
this
is
provocative
of
trade
warfare
among
states.
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
idea
that
the
states
are
equals
in
our
sovereign
system,
sovereign
states
of
equal
status.
now,
if
congress
meant
to
permit
this
extraordinary
result,
isn't
it
amazing
that
it
didn't
say
a
word
to
illuminate
this
for
courts--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
for
the
other
congressmen
who
voted
on
it,
and
for
the
president
who
signed
this
law.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
reciprocity
provision
is
one
of
dubious
constitutionality,
of
course,
under
this
court's
decision,
its
decisions.
reciprocity
has
to
be
analyzed
under
a
rule
of
reason
approach,
not
a
per
se
approach
of
the
sort
that
we
say
is
applicable
here.
our
position
about
these
laws
is
that
they
have
to
stand
on
their
own
two
feet.
they
get
no
blessing
from
the
douglas
amendment.
they
have
to
satisfy
all
of
the
traditional
requirements
of
the
commerce
clause.
whether
a
reciprocity
statute
would
pass
constitutional
muster
is
a
close
question.
it
would
depend
on
all
the
circumstances,
the
purpose
of
the
reciprocity
requirement,
its
effect
in
the
market,
and
the
availability
of
alternatives.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
correct.
now,
the
government's
argument
about
deference
to
the
board
is
especially
puzzling
here,
because
the
board
declined
to
sign
the
government's
brief.
and
it's
apparent
that
the
board
disagrees
with
the
government's
literal
meaning
analysis
because
it
said
on
the
face
of
the
statute
it
sees
no
such
literal
meaning.
now,
since
the
government
thinks
that
deference
to
the
board
is
so
important,
i'm
sure
mr.
lee
intends
to
explain
to
the
court
what
the
board's
views
are,
why
they
disagree
with
the
government's
brief,
and
wherein
the
disagreement
lies,
because
after
all,
one
who
invokes
the
rule
of
deference
should
at
least
explain
what
the
agency
thinks
about
the
submission
presented
to
this
court.
now,
i
have
one
final
point
about
the
authorization
issue.
in
1983
and
in
1984
congress
considered
bills
that
would
permit
regional
banking
laws
and
regional
multistate
compacts.
those
bills
were
not
enacted,
and
at
the
end
of
the
last
congress,
the
house
and
the
senate
disagreed
in
the
most
fundamental
terms
about
the
shape
that
legislation
should
take
in
this
area.
the
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
expressed
serious
reservations
about
the
whole
concept
of
regional
banking
and
its
economic
implications
for
the
nation.
congress
is
again
considering
regional
banking
proposals
and
is
expected
to
start
hearings
this
spring.
now,
if
the
court
were
to
hold
here
that
congress
approved
these
state
laws
sub
silentio
30
years
ago,
that
would
largely
moot
the
policy
debate
before
congress.
before
congress
would
have
a
chance
to
finish
its
hearings
on
its
this
subject,
numerous
acquisitions
would
be
consummated
under
existing
state
regional
banking
laws.
we
submit
to
the
court
with
great
deference
that
it
is
the
better
part
of
wisdom
in
this
situation
to
adhere
to
the
established
principle
that
state
laws
violative
of
the
commerce
clause
are
not
sustainable
unless
and
until
congress
gives
its
unmistakable
intent
and
its
unmistakable
approval.
congress
has
not
yet
given
that
unmistakable
consent,
and
it
may
never
do
so.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
the
reverse,
your
honor.
the
argument
is
that
the
burden
of
persuading
congress
is
on
those
who
would
impose
violations
of
the
constitution
and
the
harmful
effects
on
our
economy.
they
have
to
wait
for
congress
to
say
yes.
the
wisdom
of
the
constitutional
scheme
is
that
before
potentially
harmful
arrangements
like
this
are
implemented
by
states,
that
congress
has
to
give
its
approval,
not
afterwards
after
the
injury
has
been
done.
and
we
think
there
is
a
real
risk
of
substantial
injury
from
these
discriminatory
state
laws
in
terms
of
retaliation
discord
and
divisiveness
among
the
sister
states
which
hitherto
have
been
co-equal
sister
states
in
our
system.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
on
the
commerce
clause
issue?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
second
issue
in
that
event
would
be
the
compact
clause
issue,
and
the
question,
of
course,
is
whether
this
amounts
to
a
compact
or
an
agreement
among
the
states
which
requires
congress'
approval.
now,
there
is
no
contention
that
congress
has
given
its
consent
to
a
multistate
compact
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
court's
opinions
establish
that
reciprocal
statutes
can
constitute
compacts
or
agreements
if
they
have
the
effects
that
the
founding
fathers
were
concerned
about.
and
this,
we
say,
has
exactly
the
effects
that
the
founding
fathers
were
concerned
about...
the
danger
of
divisiveness,
regional
combinations
oppressing
commerce
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
this
has
precisely
the
impact
that
the
constitution--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
quite
true,
your
honor,
and
what
is
unique--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
do
not.
what
is
unique
about
this
multistate
arrangement
is
that
it
allows
some
to
come
in
and
doesn't
allow
other
sister
states
to
come
in.
it
confers
powerful
competitive
benefits
in
some
states,
withholds
those
same
benefits
from
direct
rival
institutions
in
other
states
just
because
of
where
they're
located.
now,
there
is
not
a
compact
like
this,
to
our
knowledge,
that
has
ever
been
considered,
and
certainly
congress
has
never
approved
a
compact
like
this.
the
closest
cousin--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
say
not
only
is
it
a
compact
because
of
the
reciprocal
nature
of
the
statutes,
but
also
because
of
the
joint
action
in
adopting
these
statutes.
now,
when
senator
brennan
proposed
this
multistate
arrangement,
he
rode
circuit
in
rhode
island
and
in
connecticut
and
urged
the
establishment
of
a
real
new
england
system,
and
he
thereafter
testified
before
the
legislatures.
when
the
connecticut
bill
was
prepared,
it
was
submitted
to
the
banking
commissioner
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
for
his
approval,
and
when
the
bill
returned
to
the
floor
in
connecticut,
on
seven
separate
occasions
the
connecticut
legislators
called
it
a
compact
or
an
agreement.
these
are
the
words
of
the
legislators
who
adopted
this
provision.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
say
a
simple
reciprocity
statute
does
not
have
to
go
to
congress
because
it's
not...
although
it
could
be
characterized
as
a
multistate
agreement
under
the
multistate
tax
case,
it
wouldn't
have
those
deleterious
effects
on
the
union
and
the
equality
of
the
states
in
the
union
that
requires
congress'
approval.
only
certain
compacts
have
to
go
to
congress,
and
the
one
you've
described
that
would
be
open
to
everybody
would
not
have
to
go
to
congress.
now,
of
course
this
is
the
real
question
in
this
case:
why
is
it
the
kind
of
compact
that
has
to
go
to
congress?
now,
the
test
has
been
articulated
in
slightly
different
ways
in
past
decisions
of
the
court,
and
ultimately
the
issue
is
one
of
potential
impact
on
our
federal
structure.
and
as
the
court
stated
in
florida
v.
georgia,
the
provision
is
obviously
intended
to
guard
the
rights
and
the
interests
of
the
other
sovereign
states
and
to
prevent
any
compact
or
agreement
between
any
two
states
which
might
affect
injuriously
the
interests
of
the
others.
now,
by
setting
up
a
regional
common
market
in
which
favored
states
are
invited
in
while
disfavored
states
are
kept
out,
we
say
that
there
has
been
established
a
treaty
of
commercial
privileges
of
exactly
the
kind
that
this
court
is
condemned
in
virginia
v.
tennessee.
it
said
agreements
among
states
that
confer
special
privileges
on
those
states
that
are
withheld
from
the
others
have
to
go
to
congress
for
its
approval.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
the
board's--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--on
the
face
of
the
paper
you'll
see
the
department
of
justice's
names,
but
you'll
see
no
representative
from
the
board
listed.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no
comment
on
that.
and
i'm
sure
mr.
lee
will
explain
the
background
of
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
he
does.
in
every
case,
to
my
knowledge,
where
he's
done
so,
the
board
has
signed
that
brief.
they
didn't
do
it
here.
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--not
in
every
case,
but
with
the
board
that
is
indeed
the
practice.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
lee
can
confirm
this.
that
is
my
own
experience
having
worked
in
that
office.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
court
can
see
for
itself
in
the
disagreement.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
counsel's
remark
about
our
position
being
a
mere
aesthetic
concern
about
the
equal
status
of
the
states
in
the
union
ought
to
be
the
starting
point
for
my
rebuttal.
this
isn't
a
mere
aesthetic
concern.
as
the
court
said
in
the
eisenberg
case,
we
could
not
exist
as
a
nation
if
states
could
pick
and
choose
among
sister
states,
and
a
fortiori,
when
groups
of
states
join
together
to
boycott
other
states
and
effectively
injure
their
economies,
this
goes
to
the
very
core
of
the
concerns
of
the
founding
fathers
that
made
us
one
nation
of
co-equal
and
indestructible
states.
now,
respondents'
position
is
that
congress
meant
to
approve
this.
it
meant
to
approve
the
ganging
up.
it
meant
to
approve
the
picking
and
choosing.
it
meant
to
set
aside
the
protections
of
the
commerce
clause
without
a
single
word
to
that
effect.
the
court
should
not
mistake
what's
being
asked
for
here.
this
is
a
giant
step
beyond
what
congress
ever
considered,
what
congress
ever
stated
in
the
history
or
in
the
statute.
and
it
is
the
better
part
of
wisdom,
we
say,
to
leave
this
issue
to
congress,
which
is
now
considering
whether
this
is
good
or
bad
for
the
united
states
of
america.
and
if
we're
all
patient,
we
think
congress
will
come
to
a
sensible
resolution
considering
the
interests
of
all
concerned.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
but
in
the
interim
serious
harm
could
be
done
to
commercial
interests
in
boycotted
states
like
the
state
of
new
york.
that's
why
this
court's
decisions
say
go
to
congress
first
if
you're
going
to
depart
from
constitutional
precepts.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
the
appropriate
course
here.
let
congress
resolve
these
policy
questions.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
are,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
wholly
aside
from
commerce
and
wholly
aside
from
compact.
thank
you
very
much.
