mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like,
if
i
might,
to
first
clear
away
what
i
think
is
some
confusion
about
the
compact
clause,
because
i
don't
think
it
really
belongs
in
this
case.
when
justice
o'connor
asked
mr.
shapiro
what
exactly
have
massachusetts
and
connecticut
agreed
to,
and
there
was
a
pause,
and
then
we
were
told,
well,
they've
agreed
to
reciprocity.
notice,
this
court
has
held,
of
course,
in
beaux
v.
barrett,
1953
that
reciprocity
alone
doesn't
make
something
the
kind
of
compact
congress
need
approve.
the
key
point
is
they're
complaining
of
the
proposed
exclusion
of
new
york.
there
isn't
any
suggestion
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
reciprocal
agreement
to
exclude
new
york.
reciprocity
means
you
let
us
in,
we'll
let
you
in.
but
there's
no
basis
whatever
for
arguing
that
there
is
an
exclusionary
agreement
in
this
case,
and
there's
been
no
response
whatever
by
the
petitioners
to
our
argument
that
indeed
as
long
ago
as
1896,
this
court
expressly
ruled
that
no
approval
by
congress
is
needed
under
the
compact
clause
where
legislation
on
the
part
of
two
or
more
states
reciprocally
permits
corporate
entities
to
enter
one
another.
i
think
the
compact
clause
is
a
nonissue
here,
and
i
think
justice
white
is
surely
correct
that
the
whole
question
is
what
power
did
congress
delegate
to
the
states.
now,
as
justice
rehnquist
indicates,
the
paucity
of
language
about
restrictions
here
cuts
only
one
way,
and
this
court
in
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
western
and
southern
i
think
made
clear
which
way
it
cuts.
when
there
are
no
limitations
placed
in
an
open-ended
grant
of
authority
to
the
states,
that
means
that
congress
meant
what
it
said.
now,
that
is
absolutely
clear
here
where
congress
could
readily
have
imposed
limitations
and
indeed
impose
one,
namely
that
the
burden
lifting
action
by
the
states,
tailoring
their
own
commerce-enhancing
package,
as
general
lee
puts
it
so
well,
that
that
step
must
be
taken
by
state
statute.
and
moreover,
quite
apart
from
the
unambiguous
language
here,
i
would
say
far
clearer
and
far
more
explicit
than
the
statement
about
the
implications
of
silence
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
we
have
here
a
case
where
the
legislative
history,
far
from
fragmentary,
is
literally
overwhelming.
the
sponsors,
douglas
and
paine,
spoke
about
leaving
it
to
the
states'
discretion.
the
floor
manager
of
the
bill,
roberston,
said
that
if
you
believe
in
states'
rights,
you've
got
to
go
this
way
because
if
you
accept
the
house
version
of
the
bill,
you
don't
give
the
states
leeway.
the
opponents
of
the
bill
made
the
argument
that
mr.
shapiro
is
making
here:
that
it
is
discriminatory.
senator
brucher
opposed
the
bill
on
the
grounds
that
it
gave
states
new
powers
to
restrict
bank
holding
companies
that
entered.
that's
on
page
674
of
the
joint
appendix
of
the
second
circuit.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
in
particular,
the
statements
of
a
legislator
who
sponsored
the
bill
are
entitled
to
special
weight.
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
cite
language
from
this
court's
opinion
in
chrysler
v.
brown,
saying
that
what
a
legislator
says
may
not
be
decisive.
but
more
recently,
this
court
in
northhaven
against
bell
made
quite
clear
in
justice
blackmun's
opinion
for
the
court
that
although
that's
sometimes
true,
the
remarks
of
a
senator
who
is
the
sponsor
of
the
language
ultimately
enacted
are,
in
this
court's
words,
"an
authoritative
guide
to
the
statute's
construction.
"
when
the
matter
comes
up
on
the
floor.
so
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
if,
as
justice
white
asks,
there
is
only
one
construction
permissible,
i
think
i
know
what
it
is,
and
that
is
congress
meant
what
it
said.
the
states
could
lift
selectively.
and
i
think,
conversely,
if
more
than
one
construction
is
permissible,
there
ought
to
be
deference
to
the
expertise
of
the
board
on
the
meaning
of
the
statute
that
it
has
uniformly
administered.
but
i
do
want
to
turn
to
the
image
that
petitioners
would
deploy
in
this
court
to
somehow
make
it
appear
as
though
what
the
states
are
doing
here
or
what
they
are
authorized
to
do
does
entail
something
like
justice
stevens'
concern
about
an
unconstitutional
condition,
a
kind
of
gerrymander,
picking
and
choosing
perhaps
among
various
states,
as
though
massachusetts
and
connecticut
through
their
statutes
brandished
the
slogan
"we
hate
new
york".
nothing
of
that
sort
is
going
on
here.
there's
a
decision
to
respect
the
historic
cultural
and
economic
boundaries
of
the
region,
the
new
england
region,
hardly
an
artifact
of
anyone's
imagination.
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
justice
stevens,
i
think
it
would
be
no
different.
the
question
would
be
this--
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
--i
think
the
question
in
that
case
would
be
is
there
a
rational
basis
for
singling
out
new
york
by
name
or
new
york
and
california
by
name,
just
as
in--
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
--well,
if
the
reason
is
we
don't
like
new
yorkers,
pure
and
simple--
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
--then
it
looks
pretty
bad.
it
looks
like
i
guess
the
merino
case
where
this
court
said
that
just
because
you
don't
like
a
certain
group,
that's
not
a
good
enough
reason.
but
here,
interestingly,
both
the
board
and
the
second
circuit
on
an
ample
record
found
that
that
was
not
the
reason.
the
reason
rather
was
a
well-calculated
decision
to
foster
a
limited
experiment
preserving
diversity
and
stability
in
a
system
at
one
and
the
same
time
responsive
to
local
needs
and
yet
likely
to
build
up
enough
indigenous
entities
to
resist
the
coming
onslaught.
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
i
guess,
justice
stevens,
that
would
surely
be
a
harder
case,
but
i
would
say
that
it
would
require
new
law--
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
--well,
i
suppose
it
would
be
harder
because
i
can
imagine
this
court
saying
that
like
persons,
states
are
subject
to
a
norm
of
equality,
and
that
if
states
by
name
are
treated
differently
by
other
states,
there
must
at
least
be
a
rational
basis
for
the
difference.
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
i
think
when
congress
says
it's
okay,
central
roeig
suggests
that
that's
decisive,
and
i
think
though
harder,
we
would
still
win
the
case.
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
well,
if
congress
has
said
it's
okay,
there
still
is
a
fifth
amendment
problem,
i
suppose,
with
the
validity
of
what
congress
did.
but
the
point
is
whichever
way
we
go
on
that,
there's
no
doubt
in
this
record
that
they
had
good
reasons.
the
federal
reserve
board
in
the
second
circuit
found
there
was
a
rational
relationship,
and
that's
easy
to
see--
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
--well,
i
would
think
if
metropolitan
life
were
extended
into
a
truly
destructive
engine
for
all
laws
of
this
kind,
there
might
be
a
problem.
but
if
you
view
metropolitan
life,
as
i
tend
to,
just
as
holding
that
when
your
whole
purpose
is
just
to
benefit
the
home
team
at
the
expense
of
outsiders,
that
that
is
not
per
se
legitimate.
then
that
would
cause
no
problem
here,
because
if
anything,
massachusetts
and
connecticut
gave
up
a
home
team
advantage
in
order
to
preserve
regional
benefits.
and
it's
interesting
that
even
after
metropolitan
life--
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
--well,
i
suppose.
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
they
were
holding
a
regional
meet,
and
they
weren't
ready
yet
to
invite
the
big
leagues
in.
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
and
if
they
picked
and
choosed
in...
picked
and
chose
in
a
wholly
arbitrary,
irrational
way?
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
i
guess
there
would
be
potential
equal
protection
problems.
mr.
laurence
henry
tribe
i
think
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause
in
shapiro
congress
couldn't
delegate
to
them
the
power
invidiously
to
pick
and
choose.
but
even
after
metropolitan
life,
which
in
this
twelfth
hour
attempt
they
might
want
to
resurrect,
even
after
metropolitan
life,
the
point
is
that
there
is
no
challenge
whatever
by
the
petitioners
to
the
findings
either
of
the
board
or
of
the
second
circuit
that
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
line
drawn,
if
that
were
an
issue
in
the
case.
and
if
justice
stevens'
suggestion
is
right
and
that
is
not
an
issue,
then
a
fortiori
theres'
no
question
that
need
be
decided,
especially
since
it
is
clear
that
congress
delegated
this
power.
but
there
is
a
question
that
is
raised
by
petitioners.
they
say
isn't
it
amazing
that
congress
didn't
say
so
if
it
wanted
the
states
to
have
this
latitude.
it's
not
at
all
amazing.
on
the
contrary,
there
are
several
fundamental
answers
as
to
why
this
court
ought
not
to
depart
from
its
precedents
in
prudential
v.
benjamin
and
western
and
southern
and
demand
specificity
and
a
kind
of
laundry
list,
as
well
as
clarity
of
congress.
for
one
thing,
there's
an
historical
reason.
congress
in
1956,
as
the
petitioners
have
never
denied,
was
expressly
told
some
bankers
believe
that
regional
approaches
are
a
good
idea.
and
as
we
explain
in
our
brief
at
pages
21
to
22,
the
only
reason
congress
then
didn't
mandate
that
solution
was
not
disagreement
with
its
potential
wisdom,
but
a
sense
that
it
would
override
state
discretion
excessively
to
force
that
approach
upon
the
states.
in
addition,
there
are
practical
considerations.
as
this
court
held
less
than
three
weeks
ago
in
town
of
halley,
the
way
legislatures
work
and
the
way
that
statutes
are
written
makes
it
unrealistic
to
expect
a
legislature
to
catalog.
there
is
finally,
and
i
think
most
importantly,
a
reason
of
principle,
and
that
is
this.
if
congress
is
to
be
the
ultimate
protector
of
the
states
as
autonomous
laboratories,
especially
after
this
court's
decision
in
garcia,
we're
to
look
to
congress,
then
when
congress
chooses
to
protect
the
autonomy
of
the
states
as
laboratories,
not
by
telling
them
which
formulas
they
may
experiment
with
and
which
they
may
not,
but
by
leaving
it
to
them
subject
to
an
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine,
for
this
court
to
deny
effect
to
that
explicit,
substantive
congressional
judgment
would
at
one
and
the
same
time
deal
a
blow
to
natural
legislative
supremacy
and
to
the
sovereignty
and
autonomy
of
the
states
as
laboratories
in
the
interest,
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
of
an
aesthetic
concern
that
all
states
are
created
equal,
even
when,
as
in
this
case,
limiting
the
region
to
new
england
has
the
effect
of
excluding
53
of
the
nation's
54
largest
bank
holding
companies.
now,
we
can
imagine
no
purpose
to
be
served
by
suddenly
declaring
this
perfectly
reasonable
step
by
the
states
of
massachusetts
and
connecticut
to
be
outside
the
reach
of
the
very
broad
authorization
delegated
by
congress.
and
if
there
were
any
doubt
about
the
proper
reading
of
the
statute,
deferring
to
the
statutory
reading
that
the
board
has
given
in
the
face
of
its
own
policy
misgivings
is
surely
the
answer.
and
if
one
says
why
shouldn't
we
let
congress
resolve
it,
i
thin
the
answer
to
that
is
clear.
congress
did
in
1956.
thank
you.
