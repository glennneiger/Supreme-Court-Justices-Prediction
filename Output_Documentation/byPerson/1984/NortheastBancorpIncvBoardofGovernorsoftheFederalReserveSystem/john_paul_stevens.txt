justice

mr.
shapiro,
may
i
question
right
there?
justice
stevens
there
are
really
two
conditions
in
the
state
statutes
here:
one,
that
the
other,
the
acquiring
bank
be
in
new
england,
and
secondly
that
they
have
a
reciprocal
provision.
what
if
they
just
had
the
latter,
would
that
comply
with
the
statute?
justice
stevens
but
your
argument
would
be
that
if
that...
if
we
thought
that
violated
the
constitution
apart
from
the
statute,
the
statute
would
not
save
that
either.
justice
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
can
i
interrupt
you?
we
got
a
lot
of
reading
material
in
this
case,
and
i
must
confess
in
that
which
i
have
been
able
to
read
i
didn't
find
something
you
mentioned
earlier,
that
the
government
brief
was
not
signed
by
the
federal
reserve
board?
justice
stevens
where
does
that
appear
in
the
papers?
justice
stevens
but
there's
no
comment
on
that
in
any
of
the
papers.
justice
stevens
well,
doesn't
the...
the
solicitor
general
does
have
authority
to
represent
the
board.
justice
stevens
mr.
lee,
i
suppose
you
would
agree,
though,
that
a
state
couldn't
attach
an
unconstitutional
condition
to
the
consent.
it
couldn't
say,
for
example,
provided
that
the
bank
is
owned
by
republicans,
or
mormons
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
so
there
is
some
limit
on
the
state's--
justice
stevens
--what
if
it
said
something
like
provided
that
the
acquiring
bank
doesn't
charge
interest
rates
that
are
different
from
those
that
prevail
in
our
state
or
something
like
that?
could
there
be
any
condition
all
that
might
affect
the
way
the
bank
did
business?
justice
stevens
well,
if
they
do,
they're
certainly
can't
be
any
commerce--
justice
stevens
--how
can
the
board...
how
can
the
board
have
some
constitutional
doubts;
that
if
it
really
thinks
congress
intended
to
do
this,
what's
left
of
the--
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
tribe,
would
the
case
be
any
different
in
your
view
if
they
thought
that
there
was
particularly
dangerous
competition
from,
say,
california
and
new
york,
and
so
we'll
let
every
state
except
those
two
in?
justice
stevens
just
new
york,
every
state
except
new
york.
justice
stevens
well,
the
reason
is
we
don't
like
new
york.
justice
stevens
--in
particular.
justice
stevens
but
you
seem
to
be
arguing
there
that
the
reasons
were
sufficient;
in
other
words,
that
there
was
a
justification
for
discrimination.
and
i'm
asking
you,
supposing
you
had
a
case
in
which
there's
no
apparent
justification,
no
legislative
history.
they
just
took
in
everybody
except
new
york.
would
that
be
a
different
case?
justice
stevens
why
would
it
be
harder?
justice
stevens
even
when
congress
says
it's
okay?
justice
stevens
see,
that's
what
puzzles
me.
has
congress
said
it's
okay?
if
it
has,
why
can't
they
do
it
for
49
states
and
not
the
last?
if
they
haven't,
then
don't
we
have
to
look
at
reasons?
