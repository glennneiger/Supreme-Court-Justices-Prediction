justice
o'connor
well,
mr
shapiro,
i
suppose
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
doesn't
really
make
it
unmistakably
clear
that
states
can
adopt
reciprocal
discriminatory
taxes,
and
yet,
the
court
upheld
that
power
in
cases
like
western
and
southern.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose,
mr.
shapiro,
you
had
an
equal
protection
claim
below
which
you
dropped.
justice
o'connor
after
reading
metropolitan
life.
justice
o'connor
i
wonder
if
you
think
that
having
read
that
case
that
you
think
the
massachusetts
and
connecticut
statutes
could
survive
an
equal
protection
challenge
under
that
doctrine?
justice
o'connor
well,
just
what
is
it
that
you
say
connecticut
and
massachusetts
have
agreed
to?
justice
o'connor
but
there
are
various
kinds
of
reciprocal
statutes
on
many
different
subjects
on
the
books,
are
there
not?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
all
of
those
are
suspect.
justice
o'connor
maybe
it
isn't
a
compact.
you
keep
saying
this
is
a
compact.
isn't
that
one
of
the
issues?
justice
o'connor
would
there
be
a
potentially
bigger
problem
in
the
instance
posed
by
virtue
of
the
equal
protection
clause
analysis
of
metropolitan
life?
