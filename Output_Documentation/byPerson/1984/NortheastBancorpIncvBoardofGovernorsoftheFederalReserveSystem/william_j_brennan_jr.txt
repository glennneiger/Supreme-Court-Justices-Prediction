justice
jr.
is
this
an
argument,
mr.
shapiro,
that
we
should
do
nothing
until
congress
has
acted?
justice
jr.
well,
suppose
we
don't
agree
with
you?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
tribe,
could
connecticut
say
we'll
let
in
new
york
banks,
but
only
some
new
york
banks?
justice
jr.
whatever
way
they
pick--
justice
jr.
--has
congress
allowed
them
to
do
that?
they
couldn't.
