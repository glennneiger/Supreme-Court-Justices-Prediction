justice
white
well,
mr.
shapiro,
suppose
it
were
perfectly
clear,
that
the
douglas
amemdment
was
perfectly
clear
to
the
effect
that
the
state
may
pick
and
choose?
you
wouldn't
have
any
constitutional
argument
then,
would
you?
justice
white
but
that
would
be
only...
that
would
be
the
only
remaining
issue
would
be--
justice
white
--so
doesn't
this
case
just
turn
on
what
congress
intended?
justice
white
how
do
you
ever
get
to
any
constitutional
issue
other
than
the
compact
issue?
justice
white
and
if
they
intended
it
to
give
the
states
the
right
to
pick
and
choose,
there
isn't
any
commerce--
justice
white
--but
if
they
didn't...
if
they
didn't
intend
to
reach
that,
then
what?
justice
white
let
me
go
back
there.
suppose
that
we
agree
that
the
douglas
amendment
didn't
intend
to
give
the
states
powers
to
pick
and
choose.
well,
then,
the
douglas
amendment
said
no
acquisitions
by
out-of-state
banks;
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
unless
the
state
agrees.
justice
white
well,
if
these
agreements
by
the
state
are
not
the
kind
of
agreements
the
douglas
amendment
purported
to
permit,
then
why
shouldn't
the
ban...
why
shouldn't
the
ban
against
out-of-state
acquisitions
take
over?
neither
new
york
banks
nor
new
england
banks
could
make
out-of-state
acquisitions.
justice
white
how
would
you
ever
reach
a
commerce
clause
issue?
justice
white
so
why
wouldn't...
if
we
agreed
with
you
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
let
the
states
pick
and
choose,
then
these
states
have
not
given
the
right
kind
of
consent.
justice
white
they
haven't
given
any
consent.
justice
white
well,
they're
not
the
kind
that
congress
anticipated.
justice
white
they
didn't
intend
to
permit
states
to
act
in
this
way,
in
which
event
there's
no
way
to
avoid
the
general
ban.
justice
white
well,
then
how
do
you
ever
reach
a
constitutional
issue?
justice
white
if
the
douglas
amendment
had
said
bank
holding
companies
may
not
acquire
banks
from
out
of
state
except
that
states
may
consent
to
do
that,
but
we
do
not
intend
to
give
the
states
the
power
to
pick
and
choose,
and
if
they
try
to
pick
and
choose,
it
shall
not
be
deemed
consent
for
purposes
of
this
amendment.
justice
white
why
isn't
that
really
what
you're
arguing?
justice
white
well,
all
right.
assume
we
agreed
with
you
that
they're
unconstitutional.
they
they
haven't
given
the
constitutional
consent.
there
is
no
consent
in
existence.
justice
white
so
neither
the
new
york
banks
or
anybody
else
could...
may
acquire
an
out-of-state
bank.
justice
white
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
if
we
agreed
with
you,
we'd
never
need
to
talk
about
the
commerce
clause.
justice
white
well,
mr.
shapiro,
do
you
think
the
statement
of
the
board
that
congress
has
just
been
silent
with
respect
to
this
pick
and
choose
business,
that
doesn't
necessarily
destroy
the
deference
that's
due
the
board,
because
the
board
nevertheless
though
it
was
consistent
with
the
statute
to
do
what
it
did.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
you
mean
they
said
we
were
acting
contrary
to
the
statute?
justice
white
but
nevertheless,
they
felt
there
was
room
under
the
statute
to
do
what
they
did.
justice
white
or
they
wouldn't
have
done
it.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
they
nevertheless
thought
that
the
statute
permitted
what
they
were
doing.
justice
white
well,
i
don't...
on
the
theory
of
silence.
that
congress
didn't
forbid
us,
forbid
our
interpreting
the
statute
in
this
manner.
justice
white
and
why
shouldn't...
and
they
left
that
up
to
us.
justice
white
i
would
think
you'd
have
to
concede
that
you
have
the
problem
of
convincing
us
that
there's
only
one
construction
permissible
under
this
statute
with
respect
to
picking
and
choosing.
justice
white
i
mean
the
board
could
have
decided
it
the
other
way,
too.
justice
white
well,
you
don't
suggest
that
in
every
case
where
the
government
is
up
here
and
there's
an
agency
involved
that
an
agency's
name
is
on
the
brief?
justice
white
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
white
well,
what
if
he
doesn't?
[laughter]
justice
white
in
order
to
preserve
a
regional
home
team.
[laughter]
justice
white
you
are
renewing
your
equal
protection
clause
argument
here.
justice
white
which
is
wholly
aside
from
commerce.
