mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
clarify
first
of
all
that
this
brief
i
have
in
my
hand
is
filed
on
behalf
of
the
federal
respondent
in
this
case,
the
federal
reserve
board.
there
is
in
this
record
some
indication
that
the
chairman
of
the
federal
reserve
board
and
one
other
member
of
the
board
have
some
qualms
about
the
policy,
the
soundness
of
the
policy
that
has
been
reflected
in
the
three
orders
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
also,
as
the
board's
opinion
reflects,
there
is
some
confusion
at
the
board
concerning
the
constitutional
issue.
we
simply
submit
these
things.
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
in
the
face
of
their
policy
concerns...
and
that's
on
page
a-1-99
of
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition...
and
in
the
face
of
those
constitutional
concerns
that
the
board
would
still
conclude
unequivocally
that
these
statutes
are
covered
by
the
douglas
amendment,
makes
all
the
stronger
the
conclusion
that
this
is
an
instance
in
which
the
board
has
lent
its
expertise
to
the
particular
item,
the
only
item
on
which
the
board's
expertise...
on
which
the
board
is
entitled
to
expertise.
it
is
not
on
the
constitutional
issue.
it
is
rather
on
the
statutory
interpretation
issue.
the
position
of
the
government
is
as
stated,
and
insofar
as
the
position
of
the
board
is
concerned,
this
doesn't
need
to
be
stated,
but
it
is
in
the
brief
that
the
three
orders
of
the
federal
reserve
board
at
issue
in
this
case
which
set
forth
its
position,
and
that's
the
position.
what
the
board
did
is
what
we
as
the
government
are
defending
in
this
particular
instance.
the
only
commerce
clause
issue
in
this
case
is
identical
to
the
statutory
question,
and
the
key
to
decision
is
how
much
burden-lifting
flexibility
did
congress
intend
to
allow
the
states
and
did
congress
allow
the
states
to
exercise.
now,
the
petitioners
contend
that
the
states
were
limited
to
a
choice
between
two
polar
extremes.
they
could
either
leave
this
congress'
total
ban
in
place,
or
they
could
lift
it
completely;
but
they
had
no
middle
ground
alternative.
and
we
profoundly
disagree.
in
our
view
it
is
very
clear
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
and
what
congress
did
do
was
to
permit
each
individual
state
to
tailor
its
own
commerce-enhancing
package
to
its
own
needs
to
identify
that
point
along
the
regulatory
spectrum
between
complete
prohibition,
complete
permissiveness
that
best
comports
with
that
state's
policy.
it
is
a
view
that
is
solidly
supported
by
all
three
of
the
traditional
guides
to
statutory
interpretation.
most
important,
that's
what
the
statute
says.
now,
the
petitioners
complain
that
congress
did
not
speak
with
sufficient
clarity,
but
i
submit
that
that
argument
only
confuses
clarity
with
specificity.
the
douglas
amendment
could
not
be
more
clear.
it
could
not
be
expressed.
and
within
any
reasonable
view
of
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
language,
the
applications
that
the
board
approved
in
this
case
were
specifically
authorized
by
the
statute
laws
of
the
state
in
which
the
bank
was
located.
what
the
petitioners
are
really
contending,
therefore,
is
that
congress
is
constitutionally
required
not
only
to
speak
with
clarity,
but
also
to
spell
out
the
details
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
states
may
act.
it
is
an
argument
which
would
interpret
the
commerce
clause
as
a
significant
limitation
on
congress'
power
to
regulate
commerce,
because
congress
really
had
two
policy
options
available
to
it.
on
the
one
hand,
it
could
have,
as
it
did,
delegate
to
the
states
the
power
to
do...
enact
general...
it
could
have
delegated
a
rather
general
power
to
the
states
to
enact.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
could
have
specifically
spelled
out
the
details
of
the
kinds
of
statutory
authority
that
the
states
were
to
have.
and
in
choosing
between
those
two,
the
choice
between
those
two
was
a
significant
policy
alternative
available
to
congress.
what
the
petitioners
are
really
saying
is
that
the
commerce
clause
limited
congress
to
only
one
of
those
two
alternatives.
it
is
an
argument
that
is
squarely
rejected
by
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
cases.
it
is
true
in
mccarran-ferguson
that
there
also
congress
dealt
in
very
general
language.
"the
business
of
insurance
shall
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
several
states.
"
and
the
fact
that
congress
in
another
section
said
and
we
really
mean
it,
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
specifically
authorize
the
states
to
enact,
for
example,
retaliatory
laws
such
as
were
involved
in
western
and
southern.
and
this
court
in
western
and
southern
specifically
noted...
and
i
quote...
"that
the
unequivocal
language
of
the
act
suggests
no
exception.
"
and
that
also
specifically
describes
the
circumstance
here.
congress
elected
to
impose
the
specificity
requirement
on
the
states.
it
was
the
states
that
were
required
to
be
specific.
it
did
not
elect
to
impose
that
obligation
on
itself.
this
approach,
i
submit,
of
leaving
important
segments
of
banking
policy
for
resolution
by
the
states
is
hardly
a
new
approach
to
american
banking,
and
the
distinctive
aspect
of
american
banking
is
highly
relevant
to
the
constitutional
issue,
because
it's
relevant
to
the
statutory
interpretation
issue
for
at
least
150
years.
ever
since
the
death
of
the
second
national
bank
in
1836,
the
cornerstone
of
american
banking,
in
stark
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
world,
has
been
localized
control.
the
number
of
commercial
banks
in
the
united
states
is
somewhere
between
14,000
and
15,000.
the
same
number
in
canada,
by
contrast,
is
11,
and
the
united
kingdom
is
36.
it
is
a
tradition
that
imposes
some
efficiency
costs,
but
it
also
provides
some
benefits.
as
this
court
observed
in
philadelphia
national
bank
and
in
the
phillipsburg
bank
case,
that
is
the
cornerstone
of
american
banking
tradition.
the
local
banker,
the
banker
who
makes
the
loan
decision,
is
a
person
who
lives
in
the
local
community,
and
as
the
court
observed
in
phillipsburg,
often
makes
loans
on
the
basis
of
what
he
knows
about
the
character
of
the
individual.
many
persons'
banking
needs
are
best
met
by
a
continuation
of
that
kind
of
a
scheme,
by
a
banker
who
is
a
member
of
the
local
community
and
who
knows
local
people
and
local
needs
and
can
respond
to
them
on
a
personal,
individualized
basis.
now,
by
contrast,
other
persons'
needs,
to
be
sure,
are
best
served
by
the
broader
range
of
services
that
can
be
offered
only
by
larger
banks
located
in
metropolitan
areas;
and
the
mix
of
those
needs
will
necessarily
vary
from
place
to
place
and
from
state
to
state.
the
central
feature
of
the
douglas
amendment
is
that
it
permits
each
state
to
work
out
its
own
mix;
that
is,
to
maintain
localized
control
over
banking
to
the
extent
that
localized
control
is
in
that
state's
best
interest.
and
in
this
case
massachusetts
and
connecticut
have
simply
exercised
that
leeway
by
opting
neither
for
total
localized
banking,
nor
for
complete,
uninhibited
interstate
banking,
but
a
middle
ground
alternative
between
the
two.
in
the
face
of
interstate
banking
as
a
very
real
possibility
as
a
future
prospect,
it
was
certainly
rational
for
these
two
states
to
prepare
themselves
for
it
by
experimenting
with
a
regional
banking
middle
ground,
an
experiment
which
would
at
lesser
costs
acquaint
them
with
some
of
the
problems
associated
with
departures
from
the
local
banking
model
that
they
know
best,
and
at
the
same
time
would
better
inform
their
later
decision
whether
interstate
banking
or
anything
other
than
the
local
banking
approach
would
best
serve
their
people's
needs.
that's
what
the
douglas
amendment
provides
for
the
states,
and
that's
what
they
have...
that's
what
they
have
taken
advantage
of.
the
legislative
history
is
brief,
and
it
clearly
confirms
that
congress
meant
what
it
said.
i
disagree
with
mr.
shapiro.
these
are
not
just
fragments.
well,
they're
fragments
in
the
sense
that
they're
brief,
but
they're
not
fragments
in
the
sense
that...
the
legislative
history
here
is
entitled
to
a
good
deal
more
deference
than
is
usually
given
to
comments
made
on
the
floor,
because
since
the
douglas
amendment
was
only
a
floor
amendment,
the
comments
made
on
the
floor
are
the
only
legislative
history.
that's
all
there
is.
there's
only
about
seven
or
eight
pages
of
it,
and
it
can
be
fairly
briefly
read.
and
the
overwhelming
conclusion
that
one
comes
away
with
when
reading
that
legislative
history
is
that
the
states
were
to
be
in
charge
and
that
senator
douglas
and
other
supporters
of
the
legislation
were
well
aware
of
this
tradition
of
local
banking,
and
that's
what
they
meant
to
preserve.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course,
of
course.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
there
is.
and
that's
the
distinction
that
needs
to
be
drawn.
this
unconstitutional
limitation
pertains
to
something
other
than
the
commerce
clause
itself,
because
congress
clearly
does
have
the
authority
to
shape
the
extent
to
which
the
states
may
enhance
commerce...
the
movement
of
goods
and
services
across
interstate
commerce.
but
insofar
as
the
commerce
clause
is
concerned,
the
argument
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
authorize
only
otherwise
valid
state
laws
simply
ignores
the
thrust
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
any
attempt
to
structure
a
separate
constitutional
argument
insofar
as
the
commerce
clause
is
concerned
from
the
douglas
amendment
itself
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i
think
it
would
once
again
come
back
to
whether
that
was
or
was
not
a
commerce-related
concern,
and
that's
also,
justice
stevens,
why
mr.
shapiro's
attempted
distinction
between
this
restriction,
this
geographic
restriction
and
the
reciprocity
restriction
or
the
grandfathering
provisions
or
any
others
just
won't
wash.
because
in
any
event
what
you
have
when
one
of
the
states
lifts
the
burden
to
an
extent
but
not
total,
you
have
left
in
place
a
scheme
under
which
there
is
a
segment
of
state
business
that
is
available
to
in-staters
but
is
unavailable
to
out-of-staters,
and
that's
what
under
this
court's
precedents
is
a
per
se
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
now,
finally,
justice
white
is
absolutely
right
that
the
petitioners
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
their
view
is
the
only
permissible
one,
because
the
agency
charged
with
the
implementation
of
this
statute
has
consistently
entered
orders
approving
acquisitions
in
all
cases
where
state
statutes
specifically
permit
the
particular
type
of
interstate
acquisition
before
the
board.
and
that
includes
not
just
these
geographic
limitations
but
also
the
substantive
limitations
where
someone
can
come
in
from
outside
but
can
only
engage
in
the
credit
card
business,
for
example.
the
fact
that
the
members...
that
the
board
may
not
have
understood
that
its
interpretation
of
the
douglas
amendment
in
this
unique
constitutional
setting
also
determines
the
constitutional
question
is
immaterial.
it
has
interpreted
the
douglas
amendment,
and
our
defense
before
this
court
is
a
defense
of
the
orders
that
the
court
entered.
and
the
court
not
only
through
it
orders
but
also
through
its
opinions
made
it
very
clear
that
notwithstanding
its
policy
misgivings,
notwithstanding
its
constitutional
misgivings,
concluded
that
these
orders
fell
squarely
within
the
scope
of
what
congress
intended
the
states
to
be
able
to
do
under
the
douglas
amendment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
white.
and
it
is
equally
clear--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--because
they
didn't
understand
this
court's
decisions
in
western
and
southern
and
in
prudential
insurance
v.
benjamin.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
