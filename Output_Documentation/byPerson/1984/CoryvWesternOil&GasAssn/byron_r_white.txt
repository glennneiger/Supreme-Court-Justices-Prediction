justice
white
yes,
and
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
and
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
yes,
but
the
chief
justice's
question
was
couldn't
the
state
charge
based
on
the
amount
of
tonnage,
in
short,
a
charge
commensurate
to
how
the
bridge
was
used?
justice
white
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem
about
that,
would
there?
justice
white
but,
that
isn't
in
this
case,
is
it,
because
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
about
wear
and
tear
on
the
state's
property,
how
much
volume
is
carried.
justice
white
yes,
there
is,
but
the
state's
property
that
is
used
in
this
case
isn't
going
to
deteriorate
because
twice
as
much
volume
is
in
one
year
than
in
another.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--so
it
is
true
of
this
one,
right?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
you
could
just
refuse
to
lease
at
all?
justice
white
and
whether
it
is
commerce
or
import/export
clause
considerations.
you
could
still
just
say,
sorry,
but
you
can't
come
across
our--
justice
white
--just
like
off-shore
oil
drilling.
justice
white
which
wouldn't
be
fencible,
would
it?
justice
white
yes.
[laughter]
justice
white
how
does
the
oil
company
use
the
state
property?
justice
white
well,
does
the
property
or
leasing
deteriorate
from
year
to
year
because
of
the
use
that
you
permit
the
oil
company
to
put
it
to?
justice
white
so,
it
is
not
like
a
highway,
for
instance?
justice
white
but,
what
about...
do
you
think
there
are
any
federal
constitutional
limitations
on
the
amount
of
the
rent
that
the
state
may
charge?
justice
white
any
at
all.
well,
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
justice
white
you
can
charge
anything
you
want
to
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned,
isn't
that
your
case?
justice
white
but,
from
a
well
to
a
pipeline
going
ashore.
justice
white
that
would
be
crossing
state
property
too.
justice
white
not
in
all
cases,
but
it
certainly...
some
wells
located
in
some
positions
are
going
to
have
to
have
to
cross
state
property.
justice
white
i
know,
but
if
a
well
is
in
a
certain
location,
it
won't
be
in
any
position
to
do
that.
justice
white
unless
you
take
a
terrific
detour.
justice
white
i
don't
understand
why
you
draw
a
difference
between
whether
there
is
a
monopoly
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
make
up
our
mind
whether
we
are
going
to
credit
this
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
permanency
of
plaintiff's
facilities
does
not
permit
them
to
shop
around.
there
is
no
other
competitor
to
which
they
can
go
for
the
rental
of
the
required
strip
of
california
coastline.
the
commission
has
a
complete
monopoly
over
the
sites
used
by
the
oil
companies.
now,
assume
we
credit
that.
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
then
under
your
view?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--i
agree,
but
it
doesn't
have
a
monopoly
over
these
particular
sites
because
of
the
permanency
of
these
facilities,
refineries,
etcetera.
justice
white
let's
just
assume
that
there
was
a
monopoly,
that
we
said
that
the
state
has
a
monopoly
at
least
with
respect
to
a
lot
of
these
sites,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
then
under
your
view?
justice
white
thank
you
very
much.
justice
white
you
have
to
look
out
in
the
ocean
a
little
bit.
justice
white
that
is
all
you
are
leasing
from
the
state.
justice
white
and
those
leases
cover
lands
that
are
used
to
carry
oil
from
somewhere
else?
justice
white
you
would
probably
find
a
right
of
immanent
domain
in
a
pipeline
company.
justice
white
exactly,
you
don't.
