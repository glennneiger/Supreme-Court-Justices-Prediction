mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
lower
court
held
invalid
a
leasing
regulation
of
the
california
state
lands
commission.
that
regulation
authorized
the
negotiation
of
rent
for
leases
of
state
property
based
upon
the
volume
of
commodities
crossing
the
leased
land.
the
regulation
did
not
prescribe
rates.
the
lower
court
concluded
that
such
a
form
of
rent,
regardless
of
amount,
constitutes
an
unreasonable
burden
on
commerce.
it
further
concluded
that
such
a
form
of
rent
constituted
a
tariff
when
used
with
regard
to
lessees
engaged
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
and,
finally
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
commission
was
limited
in
recovering
on
its
ground
leases
not
a
return
on
its
ground
leases
but
only
a
recovery
of
the
cost,
its
out-of-pocket
costs,
when
charging
rent.
this
is
a
remarkable
decision.
the
decision
accords
second
class
status
to
the
state
as
a
lessor.
it
means
that
the
state
in
many
instances
will
be
constrained
to
take
less
in
the
way
of
rent
than
would
another
lessor
in
similar
circumstances.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
this
is
one
fact
that
we
would
like
to
drive
home
to
the
maximum
extent
possible.
the
charge
is
not
made
merely
for
the
entry
of
goods
into
the
political
jurisdiction
of
california.
it
is
tied
explicitly
only
to
those
parcels
of
property
limited
in
number
which
are
made...
privately
appropriated
by
the
lessees
to
their
own
use
for
commercial
gain.
i
really
don't
know
what
type
of
rent
the
ninth
circuit
would
have
considered
permissible
other
than
a
non-variable,
flat
annual
rent
such
as
the
commission
also
charges.
there
is
a
final
line
tossed
off
in
the
opinion
concerning
this
is
not
to
say
that
all
forms
of
volumetric
rent
are
forbidden,
but
there
is
really
no
analytical
clue
in
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
concerning
what
type
of
variable
rent
it
would
have
found
permissible.
it
seems
to
me
the
thrust
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
that
any
form
of
variable
rent,
at
least
with
regard
to
the
state
and
when
it
deals
with
interstate
or
foreign
lessees,
any
such
variable
rent
is
prohibited
to
them.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
well,
another
point,
your
honor,
it
is
not
limited
to
oil.
that
is
one
commodity.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
in
this
case,
given
the
plaintiffs,
we
are
talking
about
oil
and
petroleum
products.
let
me
just
tell
you
what
the
facts
are.
i
don't
know
quite
the
direction
your
honor
is
taking
with
the
question.
the
goods--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--yes,
i
did,
your
honor.
that
was
the
second
aspect
of
the
ninth
circuit's
holding,
that
apart
from
the
problems
it
found--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--well,
certainly
the
import/export
clause
is
different.
in
fact,
it
is
so
different
that
we
don't
see
there
is
any
application
in
this
case
because
it
does
deal
with
taxes
and
this
court
in
michelin
versus
wages,
for
instance,
that
even
with
regard
to
taxes
the
question
there
is
what
type
of
taxes?
is
it
merely
for
the
privilege
of
entry
or
is
it
tied
to
some
service
the
government
provides?
we
submit
it
is
an
a
fortiori
case,
if
you
will,
when
you
are
talking
not
about
a
tax
at
all
but
a
form
of
rental.
what
the
decision
in
effect
calls
for
is
a
subsidy,
a
subsidy
to
these
oil
companies.
the
decision
is
also
unfair
to
the
other
lessees
of
the
commission
because
what
this
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit
means
is
that
certain
lessees,
among
them
these
oil
companies,
are
entitled
to
special
treatment
and
these
other
lessees,
the
lessees
of
the
state
that
are
engaged
in
intrastate
commerce,
yes,
they
may
be
asked
to
pay
a
variable
rent,
whereas
this
special
class,
they
cannot
be
asked
to
pay
such
a
rent.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
if,
indeed,
there
was
a
monopoly.
of
course,
we
think
it
is
very
clear
there
is
no
such
monopoly,
but
if
there
were
a
monopoly,
i
think
the
only
bearing
that
might
have
on
the
arguments
made
by
the
state
in
this
case
it
might
preclude
assertion
of
the
market
participant
doctrine.
cases
of
this
court
are
not
all
that
clear
that
you
have
got
to
have
competitors
in
order
to
avail
yourself
of
a
doctrine.
but,
that
would
get
us
then
into
the
question
of
reasonableness.
certainly
the
state
is
entitled
to
charge
rent,
no
question.
the
oil
companies
concede
that.
and,
if
you
concede
that--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--well,
it
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
i
do
have
some
figures,
but
i
can
say
this,
the
majority
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products
either
coming
into
california
or
going
out
of
california
does
not
pass
over
state
lands.
i
think
the
largest
single
port
in
terms
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products
is
long
beach
and
this
is
revealed
in
our
cite
to
the
corps
of
engineers'
waterborne
commerce
study.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
not
at
all,
your
honor.
of
course,
it
is
not
a
tax,
but
if
it
were
it
seems
to
me
that
would
lead
this
court
into
application
of
some
of
the
formulas
for
evaluating
taxes
that
it
has
come
up
with,
both
in
the
interstate
commerce
field
and
the
foreign
tax
field.
i
am
thinking
of
complete
auto
transit
versus
brady,
michelin
versus
wages,
and
the
import
of
those
cases
is
that
interstate
commerce
must
pay
its
own
way.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
not
at
all,
your
honor.
the
problem
is...
that
is
the
diversionary
issue
if
you
will
that
the
oil
companies
have
consistently
tried
to
introduced
into
this
case.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
excuse
me?
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
well,
the
court
of
appeals
realized
that
really
the
issue
was
the
form
or
mode
of
rent
rather
than
amounts.
but,
what
seemed
to
bother
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
so
much
the
initial
lease
where
at
time
one
there
is
no
lease
at
all
and
the
question
is
should
the
oil
company
enter
into
the
lease
based
on
volumetric
rental.
that
situation,
at
least
in
terms
of
what
the
court
said,
didn't
seem
to
bother
it.
what
it
focused
on
was
this
renewal
context
where
you
have
a
refinery...
and
there
are
some
of
them
with
internal
leases
that
do
involve
this
situation...
a
refinery
on
the
upland,
hard
by
the
wharf
site
that
is
leased
from
the
state.
and,
what
the
court
seemed
to
be
concerned
about
was
a
perceived
potential
for
the
state
demanding
and
getting
extortionate
rents.
now,
i
think
there
are
some
ready
answers
to
that
concern
of
the
ninth
circuit,
but
we
don't
think
analysis
under
the
commerce
clause
provides
answers
to
those
questions.
first,
if
indeed
there
is
a
potential
for
extortionate
rents,
that
concern,
it
seems
to
us,
applies
regardless
of
the
form
of
rent
that
you
are
talking
about.
it
applies
as
well
that
type
of
concern
with
a
flat
annual
rent
based
on
a
stated
percentage
of
fee
value.
what
if
the
stated
percentage
proposed
by
the
state
is
90
percent?
the
oil
companies
certainly
would
be
taking
issue
with
that
kind
of
proposal.
so,
it
is
not
really
the
mode
of
rent,
it
is
the
amount,
regardless
of
mode,
that
could
present
a
problem
in
those
situations.
secondly--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--if
the
market
participant
clause
is
indeed
applicable,
your
honor,
no,
the
constitution
does
not
provide
any
limits.
and,
this
is
not
an
amounts
case
either.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
excuse
me?
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
that
is
correct.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
there
are
a
number
of
alternative
responses
to
it,
your
honor.
one
is
we
are
a
participant
in
the
market.
we
are
not
taxing,
we
are
not
regulating,
which
had
been
the
traditional
concerns
of
the
commerce
clause,
not
a
proprietary
activity
of
the
state,
and,
therefore,
we
argue
the
market
participant
line
of
cases
of
this
court
takes
us
out
from
under
any
application
of
the
commerce
clause.
but,
we
don't
have
to
win
on
that
point
to
prevail
in
this
lawsuit.
if
we
concede
for
whatever
reason
the
market
participant
clause
isn't
applicable,
we
are
nonetheless
entitled
to
charge
rent.
the
question
then
becomes
a
two-fold
question,
is
there
some
type
of
monitoring
function
that
this
court
has
with
regard
to
either
modes
or
amounts
and
if
there
is
what
should
the
test
be?
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
well,
the
example
used...
it
is
hard
to
conceive
a
mere
transit
use
being
something
that
could
generate
a
rent.
but,
conceding
somehow
that
the
state
could
construct
things
where
it
could
set
up
a
legitimate
or
colorable
lease
for
that
type
of
situation,
yes,
the
state
would
be
subject
to
the
commerce
clause.
the
question
then
becomes
where
is
the
remedy,
is
it
with
congress
solely
or
is
there
some
monitoring
role
that
this
court
has
to
perform?
and,
if
there
is
a
monitoring
role
this
court
has,
we
are
quite
willing
to
subject
to
scrutiny
the
amounts
of
particular
rents
that
may
be
charged
in
the
future
by
the
state
lands
commission
with
regard
to
particular
ground
leases.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
this
court
very
well
might
be
reluctant
to
get
into
that
thicket,
because
in
the
tax
field
it
occasionally
has
demonstrated
some
reticence
about
getting
into
numbers,
calculations.
commonwealth
versus
edison
montana
is
a
prime
example.
the
court
was
content
there
to
say
there
has
to
be
some
apparent
relationship
between
benefits
provided
by
the
state
and
the
tax
in
that
case
paid
for
the
severance
of
coal.
and,
this
court
very
well
might
say,
geez,
we
really
don't
think
that
is
an
appropriate
function
for
this
court
and
we
are
going
to
defer
to
congress.
and,
congress...
that
is
not
an
idle
alternative.
congress
does
review
these
things
and
does
respond
when
pressure
is
brought
concerning
this
type
of
consideration.
i
think
the
evansville
case
is
a
good
example.
in
that
case,
this
court
upheld
a
user
tax
authorizing
or
validating
a
volumetric
charge,
if
you
will,
in
the
form
of
a
tax
by
the
evansville
airport
authority.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
well--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--well,
one,
they
would
be
entitled
to
charge
something
for
it,
no
question.
no
question,
your
honor,
they
would
be
entitled
to
charge
something.
in
terms
of
what
constraints
there
might
be,
there
very
well
might
be
a
practical
constraint,
as
we
maintain
there
is
in
this
case.
are
there
other
alternatives?
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
that
is
not
uncommon.
apparently
for
coal
rights-of-way
that
is
a
common
means
of
charging
for
use
of
a--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--well,
let's
assume
that
we
have
analyzed
the
market
participants...
or
at
least
the
availability
of
other
practical
alternatives
and
the
court
has
found
there
are
none.
it
seems
to
me
if
there
are,
then
the
court
may
not
concern
itself.
there
are
other
alternatives
that
the
persons
had.
but,
if
there
are
no
alternatives,
then
the
decision
is
is
there
a
role
for
this
court
to
play
and,
if
so,
what
is
the
test
it
should
apply
in
evaluating
that
type
of
per
ton
of
vehicle
moving
across
this
bridge
in
your
honor's
example?
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
they
could.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
i--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--well,
there
is
volume,
of
course,
depending
on--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--your
honor,
that
is
true
of
any
ground
lease.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
and,
if
you--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--it
is
certainly
true
of
this
ground
lease.
it
is
true
of
every
ground
lease.
and,
where
that
type
of
focus
leads
is
back
into
the
user
tax
cases
where
the
person
is
limited
to
cost
reimbursement
solely
and
no
type,
no
type
of
ground
lease
is
so
limited,
whether
we
are
talking
about
variable
rent
or
fixed
annual
rent
of
the
type
endorsed
here
by
the
oil
companies.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
not
by
reason
of
the
import/export
clause,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
it
just
is
not
applicable
to
rent
if
we
are
dealing
in
fact
with
a
ground
lease
and
indisputably
that
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
but,
the
corollary...
it
is
true
enough,
your
honor,
but
the
corollary--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--this
concern
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
finds
expression
in
a
number
of
clauses
and
three
of
them
probably
central
are
the
commerce
clause
and
the
import/export
clause.
now,
we
will
concede
that
they
are
all
trying
to
get
at
the
same
potential
problem,
but
they
focus
on
different
means
that
might
be
used
by
the
states
to
affect
this.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
the
analysis
proceeds
independently.
it
seems
to
us
when
you
are
talking
about
rent
there
is
a
clear
quid
pro
quo.
even
if
you
are
talking
about
a
tax,
you
are
entitled
to
that
under
the
import/export
clause.
clearly
a
ground
rent
a
fortiori
is
out
from
under
the
import/export
clause.
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
commerce
clause
has
anything
to
say
about
the
rent,
the
mode
of
rent
that
is
being
used
here
by
the
commission.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
yes,
your
honor.
one
example
might
be...
suppose
we
are
approached
by--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--there
might
be
health
and
safety
concerns,
really
governmental
concerns
that
they
want
to
lease--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--i
am
not
saying--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--that
is
not
in
my
section,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
if
there
is
a
monopoly,
which
there
clearly
is
not
here,
but
if
there
were
a
monopoly,
indeed,
you
may
get
into
motivation.
certainly
though
in
our
view,
if
there
is
a
good
faith
motive
for
saying
to
an
oil
company
we
are
not
going
to
lease
to
you
because
where
you
want
to
lease
there
is
environmental
considerations
that
cut
against
that
type
of
use.
but,
if
you
had
a
situation
such
as
oklahoma
versus
kansas
natural
gas
company,
where
clearly
what
the
state
was
trying
to
do
was
to
use
its
property
in
a
way
that
was--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--well,
the
prime
example
and
obvious
example
would
be
standard
oil's
longworth
in
richmond.
it
is
on
the
east
bay
and
i
think
currently
is
about
33
acres
of
property.
standard
takes
that
property,
constructs
a
wharf
on
it
and
underneath
the
wharf
are
pipelines
and
then
also
included
within
the
metes
and
bounds
description
area
of
the
lease
are
berthing
areas.
both
as
to
the
wharf
and...
as
to
the
berthing
areas
standard
is
entitled
to
the
exclusive
use
of
that
property,
to
that
extent
excluding
both
the
state
and
other
members
of
the
public
from
this
land
which
is
subject
to
certain
common
law
public
trust.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
i
don't
think
you
can
make
that
generalization,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
no,
this
is
a
ground
lease.
conceivably
there
might
be
situations
where
some
damage
or
erosion
occurs,
but
we
are
not
grounding
any
of
our
arguments
on
any
kind
of
wear
and
tear
and
that
is
where
we
think--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--well,
that
particular
example,
probably
the
city
of
richmond,
california.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
the
public.
i
don't
know
if
any
state
agency
is
involved
and
i
assume
that
standard
probably
has
some
of
its
own
personnel.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
well,
again,
it
wants
to
lease
its
property,
at
least
if
it
has
a
piece
of
ground
that
it
thinks
is
appropriate
for
that
use.
and,
if
it
were
to
propose
very
high
rents,
it
wouldn't
have
many
takers
in
terms
of
potential
lessees.
and,
certainly
in
the
renewal
context,
which
seemed
to
concern
the
ninth
circuit,
there
are
legal
limitations
in
the
lease
itself.
there
is
a
breach
of
contract
action
there
on
behalf
of
the
oil
companies
if
they
think
what
is
being
proposed
in
the
way
of
a
new
rental
is
unreasonable.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
in
a
monopoly--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--on
the
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--there
is
no
monopoly
and,
therefore,
the
constraints
will
be
practical
constraints,
not
constitutional
constraints.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
no,
your
honor.
there
were
statements
by
both
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
made
in
the
context
of
the
renewal
situation
where
you
have
an
adjacent
refinery
and
there
is
something
to
the
effect
that
in
that
circumstance
the
companies
must,
must
use
the
adjacent
tidelands.
there
was
no
general
statement
by
either
court
below
that
could
be
interpreted
as
saying
the
state
has
a
strip
all
the
way
along
the
coast.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
well,
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs
the
shoreline
mileage
that
is
subject
to
local
control.
we
do
not
have
a
figure
for
private
control,
but
the
locally
controlled...
local
government
controlled
shoreline
mileage
in
california
is
approximately
418
miles.
now,
the
corps
of
engineers
has
a
report
out
of
1971
which
indicates
that
if
you
include
the
entire
coast
of
california,
including
the
bays,
that
the
total
is
about
1500
miles.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
i
am
not
sure
it
is
confined
to
marine
terminal
sites.
there
are
alternative
means
for
transporting
and
dispatching
petroleum
and
petroleum
products
from
these
facilities.
rail
is
one.
on-shore
pipelines
are
another.
the
citation
we
have
to
the
atlas
of
california
shows
you
where
these
on-shore
pipelines
are
and
how
the
crude
oil
and
also
the
products
move
in
those
pipelines.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
not
in
all
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
not
necessarily.
there
are
grants
to
the
local
governments
that
do
go
out
to
the
three
mile
limit
and
they
are--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--well,
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
most
of
the
offshore--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--as
a
practical
matter
the
ocs
development
in
california
is
off
the
southern
part
of
the
coast
and
that
is
where
many
of
the
grants
are
that
go
out
to
the
three
mile
limit.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
i
don't
know
a
precise--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--it
is.
it
is
a
center
line
description
and
it
may
be
20
to
50
feet
on
either
side.
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
well,
in
many
instances
where
that
pipeline
crosses
up
on
property,
which
in
most
cases
is
private
land,
that
might
very
well
present
a
problem.
generally,
the
pipelines
anyway
as
opposed
to
the
wharfs
that
the
commission
leases
are
located
under
water.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
we
view
taxes
of
whatever
source
or
whatever
type
as
really
entirely
independent.
the
state
is
acting
as
a
landowner,
it
is
leasing
its
property,
and
it
seems
to
me
it
is
entitled
to
do
so
and
should
do
so
independent
of
other
considerations
such
as
that.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
that
is
correct.
and,
if
they
had--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--no
at
all,
your
honor.
this
case
came
up
not
after
a
trial
on
the
merits
but
after
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
and,
there
are
undisputed
material
facts
and
the
loose
language
frankly
used
with
regard
to
the
renewal
contacts
about
must
use
really
is
not
germane
to
the
issue
which
is
what
is
wrong
with
this
mode
of
rent?
again,
this
is
not
an
amounts
case.
the
decision
here
forecloses
any
volumetric
rent.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
excuse
me?
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
your
honor,
with
deference
to
the
ninth
circuit,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
throw-away
line.
it
is
really
not--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--certainly
the
regulation
is
not
so
limited.
i
guess--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--well,
the
wording
is
so
limited,
but
the
principle,
it
seems
to
me,
carries
you
back
much
farther
than
inland,
than
the
tidelands.
it
seems
to
me
the
critical
factor
is
who
it
is
you
are
dealing
with
in
the
court's
view.
if
you
are
dealing
with
a
person
engaged
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
that
is
the
critical
consideration.
as
to
those
lessees,
you
cannot
charge
this
type
of
rent.
the
intrastate
people,
the
state
courts
have
said
it
is
okay
to
charge
them
this
type
of
rent,
but
when
we
get
to
the
ninth
circuit,
no,
you
have
a
special
class
entitled
to
special
treatment.
these
companies
charge
this
form
of
rent
to
their
own
service
station
leases.
they
pay
it
to
the
ports,
but
it
is
the
state
somehow
that
can't
make
this
charge.
it
is
the
state
that
has
to
give
them
a
subsidy.
this
court
down
through
the
years
has
consistently
accorded
a
wide
range
of
discretion
to
governmental
entities
in
terms
of
the
measure
of
the
charge
that
they
are
entitled
to
make
of
persons
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
the
parkersburg
and
keokuk
cases
you
had
a
rental
charge
based
on
the
tonnage
of
the
vessel.
now,
the
obvious
argument
which
was
made
by
the
vessel
people
in
that
case,
well,
this
is
a
duty
of
tonnage.
the
court
said
no,
it
is
not,
it
is
rent.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
we
are
going
to
try
to
draw
a
distinction
between
improved
property,
where,
say,
the
port
provides
the
wharf,
and
the
situation
that
usually
obtains
here,
unimproved
ground,
all
that
goes
to,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
is
the
amount
that
is
likely
to
be
negotiated
for
the
charge.
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
even
though
they
provide
improvements,
a
portion
of
the
volumetric
return
that
the
ports
gets
is
a
return
on
the
land.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and,
there
are
also
clear
instances
in
the
record
where
the
ports
themselves
lease
unimproved
land
and
where
the
company
provides
the
improvements,
yet
nonetheless
a
volumetric
charge
was
made.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
i
assume
you
would
interpret
that,
your
honor,
the
monopoly
statement
or
the
must
use
is
confined
to
the
context
the
court
has
discussed
there,
the
renewal
situation,
the
refinery
adjacent
to
the
lease.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
i
think
it
is
clear
the
court
is
not
there
talking
about
or
implying
that
the
state
has
a
monopoly
up
and
down
the
california
coastline.
it's
demonstrably
untrue,
it
does
not.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
the
critical
consideration
seems
to
us
in
deciding
whether
a
monopoly
exists--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--it
is
a
threshold
response.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
a
common
use
of
the
word
"monopoly",
but
if
the
state
does
have
a
monopoly,
then
this
court
very
well
may
say
market
participation
is
out
the
window,
we
have
got
to
step
in
and
look
at
this
mode
of
rent
and
ask
ourselves
is
this
mode,
under
some
principle
in
the
constitution
is
this
mode
of
rent
bad?
is
there
something
in
the
constitution
that
legitimizes
solely
flat,
annual
amounts
of
rent?
is
that,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle,
the
only
mode
of
rent
that
the
state
of
california
may
use?
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
we
are
not
saying
there
is
no
scrutiny.
excuse
me,
your
honor,
do
i
have
any
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
from
some
of
the
questions
from
members
of
the
court
there
is
some
obvious
concern
with
whether
there
is
a
monopoly.
i
was
able
to
find
the
reference
to
the
corps
of
engineers'
report.
it
is
entitled
"national
shoreline
study,
california
regional
inventory.
"
published
in
august
1971.
that
report
indicates
there
are
approximately
1513
miles
of
coastline
including
the
interior
bays
in
california
and
of
that
amount
418
miles
is
in
the
ownership,
the
frontage,
of
local
public
entities
pursuant
to
grants
from
the
state
legislature.
now,
of
course,
that
418
figures
doesn't
include
the
frontage
that
is
owned
by
private
parties
and
i
just
don't
have
a
figure
for
that.
i
should
also
say
that
the
proportion
of
local
cities
to
state
ownership
is
probably
even
greater
if
we
focus
on
what
is
desirable
or
useful.
that
northerly
350
miles
between
san
francisco
and
the
oregon
border
really
is
not
necessary
or
needed
for
this
type
of
lease.
second,
i
do
want
to
clarify...
and
i
can
do
it
by
reference
to
the
record...
that
we
are
not
talking
about
a
volumetric
charge
here
that
is
added
on
to
an
eight
percent
return.
this
is
just
like
a
percentage
lease.
there
is
a
minimum
rent,
but
that
minimum
rent
is
applied
as
a
credit
against
the
volumetric
rent
and
you
very
well
may
have
situations
where
all
that
is
paid
is
the
minimum
rent
because
the
volume
has
not
been
sufficient
enough
to
generate
a
volumetric
rent
over
the
minimum.
the
citations
to
the
record
for
this
are
to
two
leases
that
talk
about
the
minimum
application
at
page
42
of
the
joint
appendix,
also
page
64,
a
union
and
a
standard
lease,
and
also
in
the
affidavit
of
the
commission
at
pages--
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
just
to
underscore
what
is
the
contention
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
i
quote
again
from
the
remark
at
oral
argument
before
the
district
court
by
counsel
for
the
oil
companies,
"to
us
what
this
case
is
about
is
just
the
validity
of
a
through-put
charge
per
se,
whether
the
state
can
charge
even
one-millionth
of
a
mil
as
a
through-put
fee.
"
that
is
the
import
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
not
even
one-millionth
of
a
mil
is
permitted
to
the
state
in
this
circumstance.
mr.
dennis
m.
eagan
thank
you.
