justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
eagan,
is
the
rent
calculated
on
the
basis
of
volume
of
oil,
is
that
it,
in
transit?
justice
jr.
or
whatever
goods,
generally
yes.
justice
jr.
well,
you
didn't
expressly
mention
the
export/import
clause,
did
you?
justice
jr.
well,
the
considerations
would
be
different
whether
that
clause
was
violated
from
the
consideration
of
if
the
commerce
clause
is
violated.
justice
jr.
mr.
eagan,
do
you
recognize
any
constraints
on
rent
by
reason
of
the
import/export
clause?
justice
jr.
none
at
all?
justice
jr.
of
course,
that
clause
and
the
tonnage
clause
both
were
intended,
weren't
they,
to
prevent
coastal
states
like
california
from
exploiting
their
geographic
positions
at
the
expense
of
sister
states,
do
they
not?
justice
jr.
yet
you
say
there
is
no
concern
at
all
in
measuring
a
propriety
of
the
rent
with
that
consideration?
justice
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
you
are
clear
under
the
commerce
clause,
does
that
mean
you
are
also
clear
under
the
import/export
clause?
justice
jr.
does
the
commission
take
the
position
that
it
may
charge
any
rent
that
is
applicable
there?
justice
jr.
what
limits
does
it
recognize?
justice
jr.
what
is
the
percentage
of
private?
justice
jr.
mr.
verleger,
i
guess
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
couldn't
allow
california
by
statute
to
charge
these
rents.
justice
jr.
and
there
would
be
no
commerce
or--
justice
jr.
--oh,
really?
justice
jr.
did
congress
authorize
that?
justice
jr.
there
is
nothing
the
submerged
lands
act
or
any
other
statute
would
suggest--
justice
jr.
--incidentally,
suppose
california
sold
this
whole
coastline
to
private
interest.
could
those
people
charge
you
any
rent
they
wanted?
