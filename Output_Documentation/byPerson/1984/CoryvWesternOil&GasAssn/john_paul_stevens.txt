justice
stevens
mr.
eagan,
can
i
ask
kind
of
a
basic
question
here
which
is
whether
we
should
look
at
this
as
a
tax
case
or
property
private
rental
case?
would
you
agree
that
if
it
were
a
tax
case
and
yet
a
tax
formula
just
like
this
for
entry
into
the
state
that
it
would
fall
or
would
you
defend
it
any
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here
it
pays
a
lot
more
than
its
own
way,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
in
your
view,
does
the
constitution
oppose
any
limit
on
the
amount
you
can
charge
even
if
you
regard
this
rent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
form
or
amount?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not
pose
any
limit
as
to
either
form
or
amount,
method
of
computation
or
amount.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
went
on
market
participant.
why
do
you
have
to
win
on
market
participant
theory
so
to
speak?
isn't
the
state
as
a
general
proposition
entitled
to
rent
the
same
way
a
private
landlord
is
unless
there
is
some
commerce
clause
implication
or
unless
there
is
some
export/import
clause?
and
you
say
the
commerce
clause
argument
of
your
opponent
is
defeated
by
the
market
participant
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
expressly
said
to
the
contrary
in
the
last
sentence
of
their
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
expressly
said
the
contrary
in
the
last
sentence
of
their
opinion.
they
said
they
didn't
outlaw
volumetric.
maybe
they
didn't
mean
it,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
also
limited
their
holding
to
tide
and
submerged
lands.
i
guess
you
don't
think
that
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
the
holding
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
said
that
was
proportionate
to
the
amount
of
use,
but
here
you
have
got
vacant
land.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question
on
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
taking
the
position
that
no
matter
how
reasonable
the
level
of
the
rent
might
be,
they
can
never
use
the
volumetric
formula?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
is
it
your
understanding
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
that
is
what
they
held;
that
you
cannot
use
this
formula
for
the
tidelands
and
the
submerged
lands
on
the
border
of
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
regardless
of
amount?
i
mean,
even
if
they
had--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand,
but
i
couldn't
quite
tell
whether
one
would
have
done
it
without
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
view
is
that
it
is
that
on
either
ground
independent
of
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
defend
the
lower
court's
commerce
clause
holding
as
well
as
the
import/export?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
you
would
prefer
a
decision
on
the
latter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
in
the
commerce
clause
one...
that
argument
wouldn't
necessarily...
you
wouldn't
necessarily
win
on
that
based
on
any
volumetric
no
matter
how
small.
justice
stevens
mr.
eagan,
can
i
ask
just
one
question?
is
it
your
position
here
the
same
privileges
with
regard
to
rental
charges
in
the
land
in
dispute
in
this
case
as
you
would
in
any
land
any
place
in
the
state?
