justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
what
if
the
state
of
california
owned
all
of
the...
owned
a
half-mile
strip
all
the
way
around
the
coastline
and
all
the
way
around
the
eastern
border
of
state
and
northern
border
and
southern
border
and
said,
you
know,
everybody
that
is
bringing
any
goods
in
here,
we
are
going
to
have
to
charge
them
a
little
rent
to
cross
this
land?
now,
there
would
there
not
be
perhaps
some
commerce
clause
implications
in
a
way
there
wouldn't
be
if
you
were
simply
renting
property
in
downtown
san
francisco?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
scrutiny
would
be
imposed--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
breakdown
between
the
city
of
los
angeles,
say,
and
then
the
state
in
southern
california?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
different
for
what
reason
in
your
view,
mr.
verleger,
because
of
the
connection
with
the
coastline?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
a
state
law
point
that--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
part
of
your
argument
based
on
state
law?
i
didn't
think
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
was
based
at
all--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so,
your
reasoning
that
you
submit
to
us
is
limited
to
tide
and
submerged
lands?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
california
had
totally
socialized
real
property,
that
only
the
state
owned
real
property,
and
your
clients
wanted
to
lease
a
place
from
the
state
to
have
a
service
station
and
it
was
in
bakersfield,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
coastline
at
all.
nonetheless,
obviously,
the
cars
that
pulled
in
there
if
it
were
a
service
station
were
going
to
be
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
would
you
say
that
the
state
couldn't
charge
whatever
it
wanted
to
ground
lease
that
land
to
an
oil
company
for
a
service
station?
