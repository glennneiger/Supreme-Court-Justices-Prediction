we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
cory
against
western
oil
and
gas.
mr.
eagan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
under
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
if
the
measurement
had
not
been
related
to
traveling
over
california
territory
but
simply
a
percentage
of
the
volume
of
material
taken
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--mr.
eagan,
supposed
a
state
owned
a
lot
of
land
and
part
of
it
is
cut
up
by
a
deep
canyon
and
they
built
a
bridge
across
that
canyon.
what
is
there
that
would
interfere
with
the
state
charging
any
fee
they
wanted
for
crossing
that
bridge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
navigable
stream
involved,
just
a
dry,
great
big
dry
hole.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
they
charged
on
the
basis
of
tonnage,
weight?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
charge
an
automobile
that
weighed
about
two
tons
at
most,
you
charge
one
fee,
but
if
a
great
big
truck
is
going
to
cross
that
weighs
20
tons,
you
charge
him
a
good
deal
more.
is
there
any
barrier
to
that
that
you
know
of?
chief
justice
burger
who
provides
the
police
and
fire
protection?
chief
justice
burger
it
is
public
at
any
rate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
right-of-way
on
which
the
pipeline
is
located
is
how
much
area,
how
much
on
either
side
of
the
pipeline?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
substantial
amount
i
would
assume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
have
possible
impact
on
real
estate
development
if
that
land...
assuming
it
is
otherwise
highly
suitable
for
real
estate
development?
do
people
want
to
have
their
house
backing
up
on
a
pipeline?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
possible
diminution,
if
it
could
be
demonstrated,
diminution
in
assessed
valuation
of
land
for
residential
purposes
and,
therefore,
a
lower
tax
revenue
on
the
part
of
the
states
or
local
governments
be
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account
in
fixing
this
rent
or
this
charge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
see.
mr.
verleger?

justice
