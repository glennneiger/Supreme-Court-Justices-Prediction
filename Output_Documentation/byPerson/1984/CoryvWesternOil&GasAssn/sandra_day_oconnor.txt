mr.
eagan,
would
the
situation
be
any
different
if
the
state
of
california
either
owned
or
controlled
every
parcel
of
land
through
which
the
products
could
enter
to
go
to
the
refineries?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
percentage
of
this
product
annually
coming
into
california
passes
through
sources
other
than
state
land
or
does
the
record
tell
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
eagan,
you
say
there
is
no
monopoly.
i
guess
the
courts
below
both
found
there
was.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
whether
there
is
a
monopoly
depends
on
how
you
define
the
market
and
how
you
define
the
market
is
going
to
determine
the
answer
to
the
question
and
how
big
a
chunk
of
the
coastline
do
we
look
at
in
defining
the
market?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
say
is
the
relevant
market
for
our
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
eagan,
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
that
subject
to
only
the
commerce
clause
that
there
is
a
monopoly.
the
state
can
charge
what
the
market
will
bear.
and,
i
take
it
it
is
also
your
position
that
the
courts
below
didn't
decide
whether
there
was
a
monopoly
despite
language
in
the
opinion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
we
would
have
to
remand
to
the
courts
below
for
that
determination
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
eagan,
do
you
think
the
position
that
the
state
must
grant
a
right-of-way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me,
yes,
mr.
verleger.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
the
state,
mr.
verleger,
charge
a
reasonable
rent
under
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
state
court
said
this
was
a
reasonable
rent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
a
volumetric
rent
is
a
typical
sort
of
a
rent
for
pipeline
use--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
is
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it
were,
would
it
be
reasonable.
