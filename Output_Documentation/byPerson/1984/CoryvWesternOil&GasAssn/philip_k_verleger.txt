mr.
philip
k.
verleger
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
start
with
this
point,
i
think,
and
sort
of
pick
up
where
we
were
a
minute
ago.
as
successors
to
the
english
crown,
the
original
13
states,
we
are
thought
generally
considered
to
have
acquired
the
tide
and
submerged
lands
underlying
the
harbors
and
the
rivers
of
each
of
their
states
from
the
moment
when
those
13
states
were
formed.
it
also,
i
think,
has
not
been
disputed
on
this
record,
and
i
don't
believe
can
be,
that
as
the
other
states
joined
the
union
they
came
to
acquire
similar
rights.
if
one
needs
to
have
a
citation,
one
is
shively
v.
bolby
at
153
u.s.,
but
there
are
many
cases
that
state
that
proposition
and
i
won't
belabor
it.
now,
the
second
point,
one
has
this
basic
picture
that
the
states
started
out
owning
the
tide
and
submerged
lands
that
underlay
the
harbors
and
the
adjacent
coastline.
now
let
me
say
that
in
u.s.
v.
california
it
was
established
they
didn't
own
out
to
the
three
mile
limit,
but
congress
promptly
in
effect
reversed
that
decision
with
the
submerged
lands
act
and
it
has
since
been
clear...
and
this,
i
believe,
corresponds
pretty
well
to
the
general
thinking
about
the
law
at
an
earlier
date...
that
they
had
this
band
that
borders
along
the
ocean.
now
that
is
the
first
basic
proposition.
a
second
basic
proposition
is
that
the
commerce
clause,
the
import/export
clause
and
the
tonnage
clause
were
of
fundamental
importance
in
the
very
adoption
of
the
constitution.
every
historian
that
i
have
read
and
many
of
the
cases
of
this
court
including
michelin
tire
and
others,
speak
strongly
of
the
fact
that
in
the
years
of
the
articles
of
confederation,
the
first
ten
years
roughly
of
the
republic,
they
are
proliferated,
there
grew
a
bale
of
assorted
tariffs,
barriers,
and
restraints
of
one
kind
or
another
that
the
states
adopted
not
only
with
respect
to
foreign
imports
but
with
respect
to
each
other.
and,
the
constitutional
convention
was
caused
preeminently
because
of
disagreement
and
through
that
condition
and
dissatisfaction
with
it.
and,
one
of
the
fundamental
objectives
of
the
founders
was
to
end
it.
now,
those
founders
were
lawyers
and
if
one
looks
at
the
basic
characteristics
of
the
charges
we
are
dealing
with
here,
one
has
to
say
that
if
the
state's
interpretation
is
correct,
then
it
must
have
been
intended
by
the
founders
that
those
provisions
which
were
so
important
be
totally
ineffective,
because
the
facts
are
these.
if
one
wishes
to
import
any
commodity,
if
one
wishes
to
bring
it
in
interstate
commerce
by
transportation
by
vessel,
one
is
going
to
have
to
have
a
dock,
some
sort
of
facility.
it
can't
fly
through
the
air
from
the
ship
into
the
land.
today
petroleum,
which
wasn't
thought
of
then,
is
one
of
the
major
commodities
that
moves
in
the
world.
it
is
a
major
commodity
that
moves
in
vast
quantities
into
the
coast
of
california.
california,
as
it
happens,
uses
about
two
million
barrels
a
day
of
petroleum
and
it
only
produces
something
on
the
order
of
800,000
from
the
internal
sources.
today
it
is
commencing
to
produce
a
great
deal
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
all
of
that
requires
pipeline
transportation
and
that
pipeline
has
to
be
laid
in
tide
and
submerged
land
and
quantitatively
most
of
that
land
belongs
to
the
state
of
california.
the
numbers
are
in
our
brief.
they
come
to
93
percent
of
the
total
if
you
include...
if
you
exclude
the
cities.
it
is
our
view
that
the
cities
are
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
and
you
need
to
count
them.
i
don't
think
a
tariff
becomes
more
permissible
because
one
agency
of
the
state
chooses
to
adopt
it
along
with
a
portion
of
the
border
it
controls
and--
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
--private
ownership
is
on
the
order
of
two
percent.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
the
city
of
los
angeles
in
general
owns
the
tidelands.
i
can't
from
memory
state
the
exact
seaward
border
although
i
believe
it
is
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
breakwater.
when
you
move
up
to
long
beach,
long
beach
owns
it.
you
move
down
to
huntington
beach
and
seal
beach
and
in
general
those
little
municipalities
own
some
along
the
coast.
then
when
you
get
farther
out
between
there
and
the
three
mile
limit
generally,
and
i
can't
speak
to
each
individual
situation,
the
state
has
it.
the
facts
are
that
up
in
the
bay
area
where
the
refineries
are
they
are
almost
entirely
dependent
on
state
land.
the
fact
is
that
all
of
this
vast
new
oil
production
comes
on
stream
in
santa
barbara,
which
looks
like
it
may
ultimately
aggregate
somewhere
between
a
third
as
much
and
as
much
as
alaska,
all
depends
on
pipelines
across
the
state
owned
property
in
order
to
come
ashore.
i
would
add--
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
--the
shoreline,
i
won't
quarrel...
if
you
are
just
going
along
the
beach,
i
would
not
quarrel
with
the
figures
that
the
attorney
general
has
given
us.
you
wind
up
with
more
than
it
looks
like
because
of
the
intricacy
of...
you
measure
the
thing
along
and--
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
--no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
you
have
to
look
out
in
the
ocean
and
that
is
the
reason
for
the
difference
between
the
400
versus
1200
miles
or
more
that
they
quote
in
the
92
versus
98
percent
we
quote.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
mr.
verleger,
but
i
don't
mind.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
your
honor,
our
position
that
certainly
the
state
has
discretion
when
it
came
to
particular
decisions
as
to
where
rights-of-ways
would
be
taken.
we
don't
say
a
company
has
a
right
to
put
a
right-of-way
wherever
they
want.
but,
if
the
state
adopted
a
policy
which
effectively
precluded
use
of
the
tide
and
submerged
lands
for
pipelines
to
bring
the
oil
ashore,
that
is
very
like
what
was
done
in
one
of
the
old
cases.
i
think
hardin
was
the
last
name
and
it
was
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
we
have
cited
it,
where
the
state
said
that
you
couldn't
use
the
streets
which
the
state
owned
for
pipelines
to
carry
gas
out
of
the
state.
that
was
held
unconstitutional.
in
my
view,
it
would
be
just
as
plainly
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
do
the
same
thing
here.
the
harbors
are
the
great
highway
it
seems
to
us
of
the
world
and
today
the
outer
continental
shelf
has
become
the
same.
and,
the
decisions
that
deal
with
whether
north
dakota
or
some
other
state
wants
to
have
a
cement
plant
have
very
little
application
to
this
sort
of
property.
this
is
a
very
different
situation.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
the
state's
own
decisions
say
that
the
state
holds
this
property
as
trustee
for
purposes
of
commerce
and
navigation.
i
think
that
ties
back
in
a
way
to
the
ownership
of
the
original
english
crown.
it
would
be
my
belief
that
the
reason
that
this
land
was
held
appertain
to
the
public
is
because
it
has
a
public
use.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
there
is
a
state
constitutional
provision
in
addition
that
says
the
same
thing.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
i
would
use
that...
well,
i
guess
it
is
accurate
to
say
that
that
fragment
of
my
argument
mentions
that
proposition.
i
think
that
that
is
a
proposition
that
follows
independently
of
the
state
law.
i
do
not
think
that
the
states
are
free
to
use
their
tide
and
submerged
lands
to
defeat
commerce,
to
create
a
barrier,
and
that,
indeed,
is
the
holding
of
the
case
i
have
just
referred
to.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
our
lawsuit
relates
only
to
tide
and
submerged
lands.
that
is
all
we
sued
over.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
at
least
it
is
all
we
are
leasing
in
this
case.
i
won't
guarantee
that
somebody
doesn't
have
an
oil
lease
somewhere
or
something
else.
but,
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
those
leases
cover
basically
lands
that
are
used
for
pipelines
to
bring
oil
from
ships
that
are
anchored
either
by
docks
or
in
some
instances
out
at
sea
in
water
that
is
two
or
three
hundred
feet
deep,
to
bring
that
in
to
the
refinery.
they
are
used
to
carry
oil
from
offshore
platforms.
and,
one
of
the
interesting
features
in
the
argument
that
has
been
made
by
a
lessee
in
this
case
is
that
it
points
to
the
absolute
necessity
of
a
commerce
clause
review
and
import/export
review
of
these
various...
of
these
terms.
they
have
said
there
are
all
these
little
municipalities
that
have
similar
positions.
well,
we
have
a
brief
from
santa
monica
which
deals
with
one
of
them.
it
is
true
enough
as
they
point
out
that
there
is
a
pipeline
that
comes
ashore
and
it
then
goes
down
through
a
half
a
dozen
municipalities
and
finally
reaches
a
refinery.
they
say,
one,
that
we
are
about
half
way
decided
we
don't
want
to
allow
any
such
pipelines;
and,
two,
they
are
free
to
charge
anything
they
want.
now,
i
submit
that
unless
some
principle
such
as
that
found
in
the
user
cases
continues
to
be
applicable
to
pipelines,
to
the
very
mechanism
and
means
of
interstate
transportation,
one
is
going
to
wind
up
with
a
situation
where
a
shipper
in
the
united
states
is
going
to
be
roughly
in
the
same
position
as
a
trader
in
the
middle
ages
when
he
had
to
pay
a
duty
at
every
little
castle
that
he
passed
from
frankfort,
let's
say,
down
to
italy.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
when
it
comes
to
leasing
land
they
owned
in
bakersfield
for
a
service
station,
i
don't
know
of
any
barrier
to
their
leasing
whatever
they
want.
the
think
the
basic
difference
here
is
we
are
talking
about
a
means
of
commerce.
we
are
talking
about
the
mechanism
by
which
property
comes
across
the
border
into
the
state,
and
we
are
saying
that
the
state
cannot,
by
calling
what
it
collects
rent,
collect
exactly
the
same
charges
it
would
as
a
tariff
and
legitimatize
the
charge
by
changing
its
label.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
but
that
they
can.
let
me
say
in
that
connection--
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
--well,
the
state
court
was
reviewing
that
in
terms
of
its
standard
for
the
review
of
an
administrative
agency,
its
decision,
which
at
least
in
california...
and
actually
a
legislative
decision.
and,
in
california
the
rule
under
those
circumstances
is...
gives
the
agency
so
much
discretion
that
i
don't
know...
all
you
can
do
is
treat
it
as
a
finding
that
the
agency
didn't
use
its
discretion.
it
is
a
different
issue.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
it
isn't.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
no.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
in
this
particular
instance
i
would
say
not
because
the
constitution...
take
imports
first.
expressly
under
the
import/export
clause
it
forbids
a
duty
or
an
impost.
a
duty
or
impost
is,
let
us
say,
in
round
figures
a
dollar
collected
for
every
barrel
that
comes
in.
and
i
submit
that
a
dollar
collected
for
every
barrel
that
has
come
in
is
the
same
thing
regardless
as
to
what
you
call
it.
now,
beyond
that
i
would
submit
that
we
have
a
very
close
analogy
in
the
tonnage
tax
cases
which
dealt
very
much
with
that
problem.
the
founders
of
the
constitution
were
concerned
over
the
problem
of
evasion
of
the
provision
forbidding
impost
and
duties
and
they
adopted
the
tonnage
clause
because
they
were
fearful
that
it
would
be
evaded
by
charging
the
ship
instead
of
the
cargo.
now,
the--
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
--well,
i
would
consider...
they
fixed
one
before,
your
honor.
the
rent
was
fixed
in
this
way.
they
appraised
the
value
of
the
property
as
industrial
property.
they
used
comparable
industrial
property.
they
then
determined
the
going
rate
of
rental
for
industrial
property
in
the
area
which
they
fixed
at
eight
percent
of
its
value
and
they
charged
it
and
our
people
paid
it.
now,
in
this
instance,
the
leases
still
require
that
reasonable
rate
of
rent.
then
they
go
on
and
file
on
to
it
the
percentage
rent,
the
through-put
rent...
what
we
call
the
tariff...
as
something
extra.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
rental
based
on
the
reasonable
value
of
the
property.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
the
other
is
more
rent
and
the
answer
is
since
it
is
fixed
on
the
basis
of
the
commodity--
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
--more
than
unreasonable.
we
think
it
is
unconstitutional
because
essentially
if
you
look
at
both
of
the
cases
that
deal
with
imposts...
michelin
tire
was
very
careful
to
say
that
this
was
not
a
charge
for
simple
entry
into
the
country.
in
the
tonnage
tax
cases
the
court
was
explicit
in
saying
the
state
or
the
city...
because
those
cases
treat
the
state
and
the
city
as
the
same...
could
charge
for
facilities
they
provided
but
could
not
charge
for
the
use
of
the
unimproved
bank
of
the
river
and
that
is
essentially
what
we
have
here.
now,
if...
let
me
say
as
i
go
further
in
that
connection
that
one
of
my
puzzles
in
this
connection
has
been
the
degree
to
which
this
case
raises
issues
of
the
montana
power
and
the
louisiana
v.
maryland
and
the
issues
raised
in
the
commerce
clause
and
in
import
cases
generally.
my
reasons
for
uncertainty
is
simply
that
first
of
all
in
the
first
sentence
of
their
brief
the
state
recites
that
we
do
not...
the
first
sentence
of
the
reply
brief...
that
we
do
not
contend...
the
words
are
"without
question
a
simple
charge
for
the
privilege
of
bringing
merchandise
into
the
country
would
be
prohibited
under
the
import/export
clause.
"
that
is
the
first
sentence
of
the
reply.
and,
similarly,
while
i
see
no
such
concession
as
to
commerce,
i
see
no
connected
argument
anywhere
that
this
kind
of
a
charge
is
all
right
under
the
commerce
clause
and
i
hesitate,
therefore,
to
embark
on
a
debate
that
may
not
be
before
this
court
at
this
time
at
all
and
yet
i
am
a
little
concerned
that
if
i
say
nothing
on
it
the
subject
may
be
the
subject
of
a
decision
to
which
i
have
contributed
very
little
because
one
hesitates
to
answer
an
argument
that
hasn't
been
made.
let
me
say,
therefore,
simply
these
things.
that
is
it
is
my
belief
that
the
court's
most
recent
cases
recognize
the
necessity
of
preserving
something
like
the
doctrine
of
the
user
tax
cases
here,
to
start
with
evansville
which
says
that
the
charge
of
one
dollar
per
passenger
at
an
airport
was
all
right
because
it
didn't
exceed
cost.
it
is
a
1972
decision.
it
is
a
relatively
modern
decision.
to
continue,
in
montana
power
this
court
speaks
of
the
invalidity
of
a
tax
which
bears
no
relationship
to
the
taxpayer's
activities
and
it
goes
forward
and
refers
to
nippert
v.
richmond
and
michigan-wisconsin
pipeline
v.
calvert.
now,
both
of
those
cases
were
cases
where
impractical
operation
they
taxed
more
severely
on
interstate
commerce.
and,
let
me
say
simply
that
if
one
looks
at
the
army
engineers'
statistics
that
our
friends
and
the
others
have
cited,
it
will
practically
appear
that
quite
literally
when
it
comes
to
crude
oil
this
law
has
its
application
essentially
100
percent
to
imports
and
to
interstate
commerce
and
as
to
products
it
must
be
in
the
order
of
90
percent.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
congress
could.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
there
would
be
no
commerce
clause
problem
clearly
on
import/export.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
well,
i--
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
--well,
i
hadn't
thought
since...
the
two
are
different,
that
is
all
i
mean
to
say.
my
belief
is
that
if
congress
expressly
did
it
it
would
be
all
right.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
i
have
found
no
congressional
act.
i
think
the
question
of
how
this
would
affect
the
application
to
the
oil
brought
in
from
federal
leases,
if
it
became
prohibitively
high,
is
a
question
that
was
involved
in
louisiana
v.
maryland,
but
not
decided,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
presented
on
the
record
here.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
the
answer
is
i
think
i
don't
know.
if
it
got
too
high,
i
expect
i
would
be
in
court,
but
the
truth
is
i
haven't
analyzed
that
problem,
so
i
hesitate
to
speak
to
it.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
some
have
it
that
might
be
used.
the
problem
is
we
don't
have
it
against
the
state.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
sure.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
it
is
our
sense
that...
particularly
under
the
import/export
clause
that
the
volumetric
formula
applied
on
imports
produces
exactly
the
same
result
as
a
tariff
in
the
same
amount.
now,
it
is
very
clear
that
the
state
could
not
apply
a
tariff
no
matter
how
reasonable
it
was.
and
that,
i
think,
irrespective
of
all
the
criteria
in
complete
thought
of
transit
because
you
have
got
an
express
prohibition.
so,
they
can't
have
a
reasonable
tariff.
i
have
trouble
with
anything
that
permits
them
to
do
the
same
thing
because
it
is
obvious
that
from
the
beginning
they
owned
all
this
real
estate
and
while
they
have
sold
off
some
of
it
they
have
still
got
most
of
it.
the
cities
i
count
as
the
same
thing.
it
seems
to
me
no
defense
at
all
to
say
that
the
cities
are
doing
the
same
thing.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
i
believe
they
so
held.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
also
i
have
found...
i
think
their
view
was
that
the
amount
was
unreasonable
too.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
one
never
knows
for
sure,
but
my
view
is--
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
--i
also
urge,
even
though
the
cases
i
have
to
rely
on
are
older,
that
a
straight
tariff,
something
that
says
you
have
got
to
pay
fifty
cents
a
bushel
or
a
barrel
to
come
into
a
state...
into
california
from
nevada,
for
instance,
unless
justified
under
the
rules
of
the
user
taxes,
would
be
bad.
the
michigan-wisconsin
pipeline
case
is
as
good
an
example
as
any.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
i
do.
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
well,
we
are
concerned
with
both
because--
mr.
philip
k.
verleger
--no.
i
think
that
in
the
commerce
clause
the
critical
question
is
the
relation
to
cost
idea
that
appears
in
the
user
tax
cases.
i
think
that
because
of
the
special
situation
of
transportation
across
state
lines
that...
it
seems
to
me
the
constitutional
necessity
that
there
be
a
prohibition
on
a
simple
set
of
tariffs
that
are
put
up
by
states
at
the
border,
that
that
doctrine
remains
essential
and
i
note
that
in
footnote
12
in
the
montana...
in
the
commonwealth
edison
v.
montana
power
this
court
gives
a
continued
effect
of
that
doctrine
in
situations
that
are
sort
of
quasi
proprietary.
that
is
what
the
note
said.
and
this
is
pretty
much
that
situation.
so,
i
would
conclude
that
that
doctrine
arranged
an
essential
there
as
to
interstate
commerce
as
well
as
foreign
commerce.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
use
of
title
as
a
vehicle
for
the
imposition
of
creation
of
a
barrier,
however
small,
at
the
state
border
is
just
as
undesirable
for
interstate
commerce
as
it
is
for
foreign
and
i
note
that
in
michelin
tire
this
court
has
sought
to
amalgamate
the
concepts
of
the
import/export
clause
and
the
commerce
clause
to
the
extent
feasible.
in
that
case
what
was
done
was
to
take
commerce
clause
ideas
and
apply
them
to
the
import/export
clause,
but
i
would
submit
as
one
looks
at
the
necessity
of
a
protection
against
a
true
sort
of
barrier
at
the
border
that
the
same
logic
applies.
let
me
add
that
there
are
plenty
of
situations
that
illustrate
the
necessity.
it
is
a
fact,
for
instance,
that
oil
from
alaska
comes
ashore
in
long
beach.
it
then
is
put
into
what
is
known
as
the
four-corner
pipeline.
it
traverses
the
city
of
los
angeles,
it
crosses
the
state's
highways,
it
crosses
the
land
of
probably
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
maybe
assorted
cities
and
counties
as
it
goes
between
los
angeles
and
midland,
texas.
and,
every
time
it
crosses
a
street
or
a
highway,
it
is
crossing
some
state's
property.
if
the
rule
is
that
the
state...
i
say
simply
that
if
the
rule
is
that
the
state
can
charge
anything
it
wants
for
the
use
of
its
property,
then
i
submit
we
will
be
back
in
the
same
situation
as
a
peddlar
in
the
middle
ages.
thank
you.
