justice
white
you...
you
say
that...
that
you
should
win
because
there's
no
discrimination.
this
is
really
not
much
different
from
what
the
united
states
argues,
is
it?
they
just
say
that
even
if
you
take
an
effects
test,
there's
no
difference
in
effect.
justice
white
isn't
that
just
as
good
a
way
of
putting
it?
