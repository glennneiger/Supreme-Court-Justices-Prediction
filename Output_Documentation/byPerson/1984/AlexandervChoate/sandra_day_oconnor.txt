justice
o'connor
i'd
like
to
ask,
general
cody,
if
an
effects
test
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
how
could
you...
how
could
you
have
the
finding
about
whether
the
treatment
is
equal
or
unequal
without
letting
it
go
to
the
hearing?
in
other
words,
is
a
prima
facie
case
made
out
on
the
facts
such
as
existed
here
with
the
resolution
of
the
effect
to
be
made
thereafter?
justice
o'connor
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
the
case
decided
by
this
court
last
term,
consolidated
bail
v.
darrone,
if
that
is
the
correct
pronunciation,
indicates
that
congress
incorporated
into
section
504
an
effects
standard...
in
other
words,
the
standard
adopted
by
hhs
regulations?
justice
o'connor
but
there
certainly
is
language
to
that
effect
in
the
opinion,
isn't
there?
justice
o'connor
so
was
that
just
wrong,
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
well,
doesn't
that
depend
on
how
you
define
benefit?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
you
define
the
benefit
as
medical
services,
how
can
you
prevail?
justice
o'connor
well,
even
assuming
an
effects
test
is
incorporated,
that
doesn't
mean
you
necessarily
prevail,
because
if
the
solicitor
general
is
correct,
you
don't
look
at
the
results;
you
look
at
the
opportunity
for
a
particular
medical
service.
justice
o'connor
well,
you're
equating
the
benefit
with
the
particular
advantages
that
one
might
gain
from
the
benefit,
and
that's
the
point.
maybe
you
don't
have
to
do
that.
and
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
is
saying.
justice
o'connor
only
in
a
generic
sense
perhaps
by
the
fact
that
congress
encouraged
states
to
provide
some
medical
services
available
to
all.
isn't
that
true?
and
the
overall
effect
of
that
for
the
nation
as
a
whole
might
be
improved
care.
