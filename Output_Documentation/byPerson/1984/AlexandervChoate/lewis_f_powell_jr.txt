mr.
bonnyman,
i'm
still
not
100
percent
sure
i
understand
your
position.
tell
me
this.
before
tennessee
reduced
the
20
days
to
14
days
was
its
program
invalid?
justice
jr.
do
you
think
it's
a
matter
of
evidence?
justice
jr.
i
say
would
it
turn
on
a
matter
of
evidence?
justice
jr.
with
respect
to
each
claimant?
justice
jr.
so
that
if
this
case
were
here
from
florida
that
provides
45
days,
you'd
still
have
to
have
a
litigation?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
well,
is
it
correct
then
that
your
position
is
not
focused
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
reduction
from
20
to
14
days?
justice
jr.
yes,
yes.
but
you
didn't
challenge
it
before,
did
you?
justice
jr.
well,
i
was
simply
going
to
repeat
my
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
change
makes
any
difference.
i
suppose
it
does
not
in
my
understanding
of
it.
justice
jr.
right.
