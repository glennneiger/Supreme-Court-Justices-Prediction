mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
say
first
what
this
case
is
not
about.
it
is
not
about
whether
the
state
of
tennessee
can
reduce
its
medicaid
program
or
any
other
federally-assisted
program.
the
case
is
not
about
whether
the
state
has
to
resort
to
affirmative
action
to
satisfy
section
504.
the
case
is
simply
whether
when
it
does
impose
a
reduction
in
social
program
it
can
do
so
in
a
manner
which
disproportionately
imposes
upon
the
handicapped
or
any
other
protected
group
a
grossly...
in
this
case
grossly
disproportionate
burden
of
bearing
the
brunt
of
the
cutback.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
record
is
not...
the
record
is
not
clear,
but
it
suggests
that
an
annual
limit
itself
is
problematic;
that
the...
the
evidence
that
was
produced
below
suggests
that...
it
doesn't
just
suggest;
it
is
very
clear
that
we
were
talking
about
a
limitation
that
the
state
of
tennessee
employs
that
very
few
other
states
employ,
and
that
there
are
a
range
of
other
ways
of
defining
the
service.
and
i
think
this
is
critical.
what
is
it
that
the
medicaid
program
funded
by
congress
is
designed
to
give?
and
what
it
is
designed
to
do
if
you
look
at
the
medicaid
act
itself
is
hospitalization.
now,
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--i
do
not
agree,
your
honor,
and...
and
i
think--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--no.
again...
again,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
evidence
regarding
an
annual
limit
on
the
number
of
days...
and
keep
in
mind,
there's
nothing
in
the
medicaid
act
under
which
these...
these
services
are
provided
that
enshrines
an
annual
limit
on
the
number
of
days.
if
you
look
at
that
particular
method
of
limiting
the
care,
it
is
probably
problematic.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
i
think
that...
i
think
that
is...
is
true,
your
honor.
on
the
record
in
this
case...
and
i
should
say
preliminarily
that...
that
the...
that
the
record
is
uncertain,
as
we
point
out
in
our...
in
our
brief,
reply
brief,
because
of
the
number
of
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
the
program
since
it's
been
on
appeal.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that,
frankly,
is...
is
incorrect.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
no.
i
think
that
what...
and
we
are
not
proprietary
about
the
particular
alternative
that
we
put
on
evidence.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
that
would
not
be
problematic,
your
honor.
a...
a...
a
limit
that
is
based...
that
many
other
states
use
of
screening--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
but
i
think...
i
only
point
to
the
experience
of
other
states
to
make
the
point
that
it
is
feasible.
and
if
you...
if
you
look
at
the
way
this
annual
limit
operates,
it
operates...
we
are
not
talking
about
degree;
we
are
talking
about
kind.
at
a
certain
point
in
the
fiscal
year
these
people,
overwhelmingly
handicapped,
are...
are
absolutely
barred
from
the
hospital.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
any
annual
limit
on
the
number
of
days
in
the
hospital.
that
is
not
true,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
most
of
the
ways
of
calculating
the
hospitalization
benefit
afforded
by
this--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
that
may
be
why
the
sixth
circuit
said
we
had
only
established
a
prima
facie
case,
and
it
ought
to
be
remanded
for
that
sort
of
justification,
if
it
exists
to
be
offered.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
with
no
limit
on
the
number
of
admissions.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
our
point
there
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
way...
if
you
look
at
the
expert
testimony
about
the
way
the
hospitals
respond
to
these
limits
and
the
way
the
hospitals
respond
to
these
limits
and
the
way
medicaid
recipients
gain
admission
to
the
hospital,
that
would
afford
access
to
hospitalization,
as
would
the
host
of
other
alternatives
used
by
other
states.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
the...
the
regulations,
your
honor,
the
hhs
regulations
on
which
we
rely
do
not...
and
i
think
this
is
very
important...
do
not,
as
the
solicitor
general
suggests
we
are
arguing,
guarantee
an
equal
result.
you
couldn't
legislate
an
equal
result
in
terms
of
health
care
even
if
you
wanted
to.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
needs
to
be
read
more
carefully
than...
than
the
way
it
is
being
read
by
the
government.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
only
what
the
regulations
which
were
upheld
in
the
darrone
case
say,
and
that
is
not
that
there
have
to
be
equal
results,
but
that
there
has
to
be
an
equal
opportunity
to
achieve
the
benefit
for
the
results
afforded
by
the
program.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
you
define
it
in
terms
of
hospital
services...
and
i
think
that's
the
correct
way
to
define
it,
because
that's
the
way
the
medicaid
act
defines
it...
the
state,
after
all,
is
not
free
to
go
out
and
make
up
another
definition.
if
you
define
it
in
terms
of
hospital
services,
then
what
that
means
in
terms
of
equal
opportunity
to
gain
the
benefits
of
that
service
is
an
equal
opportunity
to
gain
admission
to
the
hospital
to
receive
that
care.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
your
honor,
we
would
suggest
on
the
record
that
there
are
probably...
that
this...
this
basic
way
of
casting
the
coverage
probably
on
the
evidence
adduced
below...
and
again,
that
evidence
may
have
changed
with
the
changes
in
the
program...
that
that
particular
way
of
casting
the
coverage
is
probably
not
acceptable
under
504.
that
still
leaves
an
array
of
alternatives
available.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
we
think
that
probably
none
of
those
days
would
be
acceptable.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
no
more
days,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--well,
what
we
are
arguing
about
is
that...
that
there
are...
and
that's
the
whole
problem
with
this
particular
method
that
tennessee
and...
has
chosen,
because
we
are
not
asking
for
more
days
for
the
handicapped
and
the
nonhandicapped.
we
are
simply
asking
for
a
result
which
is
fair
in
effect--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--as
well
as
in
form.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
like,
for
example--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--it...
it--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
what
we
are
looking--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
according
to
the
state--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--right.
the
state
can
only
make
that
claim
by
ignoring
the
reality
of
what
happens
once
you
reach
14
days,
which
is
you
simply
do
not...
and
we're
talking
about
lifesaving
care,
as
the
record
indicates...
we
do
not
have
access
to
that
care
at
day
14...
after
day
14.
and
what--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
there
was
a
duly
constituted
medicaid
advisory
committee
which
was
comprised
of
patients
and
representatives
and
consumers,
and...
and
it
roundly
condemned
this
particular...
this
particular
cutback,
and
the
state
legislature
has
said
it
makes
no
sense
because
of
its
impact
on
hospitals.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
it
did
hold
hearings
after
the
fact,
and...
and
we
cite
a
legislative
finding
there
that
the
effect
of
this
particular
way
of
cutting
has
been--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
and...
and
that
brings
us
to
the
nature
of
handicapped
discrimination
and
the...
the
reason
why
504
if
it
is
not
construed
to
reach
discriminatory
impact
absent
intent,
is
simply
going
to
be
meaningless;
because
the
nature...
we
do
not
have
a
history
of
people
burning
crosses
on
the
lawns
of
the
handicapped
or
painting
swastikas
on
the
sides
of
rehabilitation
centers.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
we
would
say
in
this
case
nothing,
your
honor.
i
mean
that's
my
point;
that...
that
we
are
not
talking
about
malevolence.
we
are
talking
about
simple
obliviousness.
the...
the
state
was
very
candid
in
saying
we
never
thought
about
the
impact
of
this
on
the
handicapped,
never
gave
it
a
moment's
thought,
and
we
don't
have
to.
we
don't
have
to.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
i...
i
think
critical
to
the...
to
the
solicitor
general's
position
are
two
fallacies.
one
is
a
characterization
of
our
argument
and
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
as
mandating
equal
results.
and
again,
we
are
not
asking
for
that.
we
are
only
asking
for
what
the
regulations
mandate,
which
is
an
equal
opportunity.
if...
if
someone,
for
example,
is
quadriplegic
and
has
pneumonia,
as
is
common
among...
commonly
occurs
among
people
who
are
quadriplegic,
goes
to
the
hospital
in
june,
the
chances
are
he's
not
going
to
be
admitted.
if
he
is
not
handicapped,
the
chances
are
very
likely
that
he
will
be.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
you...
if
you
adopt
the
solicitor
general's
approach
to
impact
tests,
it's
going
to
be
very
easy
for
any
defendant
in
these
case
to
resort
to
the
tautology
that
the
benefit,
which
is
being
distributed
unequally,
is
whatever
we
define
it
to
be.
we
have
defined
this
benefit
as
14
days.
well,
clearly
everybody
has
access
to
14
days.
but
that
is
not
the
benefit
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
congress,
when
it
put
out
the
billion
dollars
of
medicaid
dollars
that
this
state
had
received
had
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
case
in
the
district
court,
was
concerned
about
meeting
the
health
needs
of
people
and
mandated
that
states
who
receive
this
money
provide
hospital
services.
so
they
were...
i
think
you'd
have
to
turn
the
medicaid
act
on
its
head
to
say
congress
wasn't
concerned
about
the
effect
on
treatment
of
patient
conditions.
it
was
only
concerned
that
you
pump
out
these
dollars.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
mandate
that
they
meet
all
of
the
needs
of
everyone,
and...
and
that's
why
it's
important
to
go
back
to
our
first
concession
from
the
moment
the
complaint
was
filed.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
state
cannot
reduce
its
program.
we're
not
trying
to
hamstring
that
part
of
their
operation.
we're
simply
saying
when
they
do
it,
they
have
to
do
it
in
a
way
where
the...
i
mean
they've...
they
conceded
in
their
brief
to
the
sixth
circuit
the
impact
of
this
reduction
falls
with
disproportionate
effect
on
the
handicapped
as
compared
to
the
nonhandicapped.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
i
think
it
is...
it
is
both
of
those,
but
primarily
the
latter.
i
mean
let's
look
again
at
the
example
of
someone--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--that,
in
other
words--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--may
have
to
stay
longer
and...
but
more
importantly,
given
the
fact
that
what
we're
concerned
about
is
simply
getting
access
to
the
hospital
to
begin
with,
he
is
more
likely
to
have
been
in
the
hospital
previously
within
the
fiscal
year
so
that
he's
already
exhausted
the
state's--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--or
the
same
one.
i
mean
i
cite
pneumonia
simply
because
that
does
tend
to
recur
among
people
with
quadriplegia
or--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
i...
i
don't--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
that...
that
the
way
we
can
lose
the
case
is
if
we
go
back
on
remand--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--and
the
state
shows
that
there
as
no
alternatives,
as
have
been
suggested
here;
there
are
no
alternatives
which
won't
have
the
same
impact.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
right.
and
we
say
we
concede
from
ab
initio
that
that
is
not
required
by
504
because--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--we
concede
that.
this
cut
is
gratuitous.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
on
the
evidence
now
before
the
court
it's
gratuitous.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
you
just
analyze
this
in...
in...
in
the
way
impact,
disparate
impact
cases
go,
we
have...
we
have
gone
beyond
our
initial
burden.
i
mean
we
have
shown
an
alternative
that...
because
we
realized
that
the
concern
of
any
court
was
going
to
be...
isn't,
as
justice
stevens
alluded...
i
mean
the
handicapped
are
going
to
need
more
health
services
generally,
and
it
isn't
anything
subject
to
challenge.
and
we
simply
wanted,
not
because
we're
proprietary
about
a
particular
alternative,
we
just
put
on
proof
to
show
that
there
are
a
range
of
alternatives,
that
the
one
we've
talked
about
being
one
of
them,
which
are
available.
and
the
sixth
circuit
was
obviously
concerned
that
they
got
no
response
from
the
state
on
that.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
i...
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
regulations
and
you
look
at
our
contentions,
we
are
not
talking
about...
we
are...
we're
not
talking
again
about
degree;
we're
talking
about
kind.
we
are
talking
about
not
the
sort
of
gradations
that
were
at...
at
issue
in
the
rowley
case,
but
an
absolute
bar
to
the
benefits
of
this
program.
i
mean
that's
the
way
this
cut
operates.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
mean
that...
again,
that
goes
back
to
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
at
the
trial,
and
the
expert
testimony
was
that
that
is
not
the
way...
that
is
not
the
way
it
works.
you
will
not
get
into
the
hospital
to
begin
with
if
you
have
exhausted
your
days,
but
you
will
be
readmitted
so
long...
the
hospitals...
and
this
goes
into
the
question
of
bed
vacancies
and
marginal
economic
gain
to
the
hospital...
but
the
hospitals
are
happy
to
have
you,
basically,
if
you
have
a
few
days
available
at
the
time
that
you
apply
for
admission.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
right.
and...
and--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
you
can't
divorce...
like
all
cases
which
are
context
specific,
you
can't
divorce
this...
these
questions
from
the
record.
and
there
is
a
very
concrete
record,
none
of
which
was
contradicted
by
the
state,
about
the
way,
the
specific
way
in
which
this
limit
operated
to
bar
access
to
the
hospitals.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
would
not
have
any
bite
to
it,
i
don't--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--it
would
save
the
state
the
money,
if
that's
what
your
concerned
with.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
do
not...
once
you're
in
the
hospital,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
they
do
not
get
paid
for
that.
again,
that
goes
to...
it
is
in
their
interest
to
take
you
if
you
have
even
a
few
days
and
they
know
you're
going
to
stay
longer
simply
because
there
are
a
lot
of
vacant
beds,
and
there
is
a
marginal
economic
incentive
for
them
to
take
you.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
we
don't
have
evidence
on
that,
your
honor,
because
the
way--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
it
does.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
no.
well,
with
respect
to
the
statistical
impact
on
the
class
as
a
whole.
in
other
words,
we...
simply
do
not
because...
because
there
are
no
records
of
use
beyond
20
days,
and
everybody
is
lumped
in
at
20
days,
there's...
we
don't
know
actually
what
the
impact
of
20
days
per
se.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
i...
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
i
mean
one
point
we
make
in
our
brief
again
is
that
there
have
been
a
number
of
changes
in
the
program.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
and
that
when
we
go
back
on
remand,
we're
going
to
have
to
reassess.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
again
there...
we...
we
did
not
have
enough
proof,
i
think,
to
challenge
the
20
days.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
and...
and
again,
if
you...
excuse
me.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
i
think
this...
and...
there
seems
to
be
an
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
solicitor
general's
position
that
somehow
the...
the
annual
limit
was
enshrined
in
the
medicaid
act,
and
that's
a
central
fallacy.
what's
enshrined
in
the
medicaid
act
is
the
meeting
of
patient
needs
through
the
delivery
of
hospital
services;
and
they've
created
this
tautology
of--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--it
can
and
it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
i
mean
it
has...
what
it
has
said
in
the
context
of...
it
can
do
so
in
two
ways.
it
can
do
so
under
its
authority
as
administrator
of
the
medicaid
program
under
title
19
of
the
social
security
act
by
saying
there
are
certain
services
that
you
have
to
provide,
and
inpatient
hospital
care
is
one
of
those
services.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
that
has...
that
has
never
been
finally
resolved.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
i
think
it
probably
does.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
under...
under
the
medicaid
act
it
has
not
defined
what
would
be
minimally
necessary
in
the
number...
in
the
amount
of
hospital
services
to
satisfy
the
medicaid
act.
our
contention,
of
course,
is
that
hhs
under
its
regulatory
authority
under
504
has
limited
that.
i
mean
that's
central
to
our
position;
that
the
regulation
which
says
the
state
cannot
employ
methods
of
administration
which
have
the
effect,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
read
it,
"methods
of
administration
that
have
the
effect
of
substantially
impairing
accomplishment
of
the
objectives
of
the
recipients
program
with
respect
to
handicapped
persons.
"
that's
45
cff
84.4.
and
they
are
employing
a
method
of
administration
that
they...
they
are
basically
putting
form
above
substance.
the
substance
under
the
medicaid
act
is
meeting
the
need
for
hospital
service...
again,
not
completely.
it's
not
a
guarantee
that
all
needs
will
be
met,
but
that
is
the
focus,
meeting
that
need.
section
504,
which
is
attached
to
that
as
a
funding
condition,
says
in
meeting
that
need
or
in
imposing
a
limit
on
the
extent
to
which
you're
going
to
meet
that
need,
you
may
not
employ
a
method
of
administration
which
impairs
the
accomplishment
of
the
objectives
of
the
program
for
the
handicapped.
and
that's
exactly
what
this
annual
limit
does.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
because
he's
not...
congress...
congress
has
not
chosen
to...
to
protect
that
person.
congress
has
enacted
section
504
specifically
for
the
protection
of
the
handicapped
with
knowledge
of
the
needs
of
the
handicapped,
and
we
are
here
traveling
under
that
statute.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it...
it
is
section...
45
cfr
section
84.4.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
84.4.
and
there
is
a
subpart--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--(a)(4),
the
section
i
just
read,
and
then
there
is
a
separate
provision...
i'm
sorry.
i
said
(a).
it's
subsection
(b).
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
84.4(b)(4),
and
84.4(b)(1)
and
then
small
roman
numeral
iii.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
and
it
says,
"you
cannot
provide
a
qualified"...
that
letter
section
that
i
had
not
read
before...
"provide
a
qualified
handicapped
person
with
a
benefit
or
service
that
is
not
as
effective
as
that
provided
to
the
others.
"
"for
the
purpose
of
this
part
you
do
not
have
to
guarantee
equal
results.
"
--again,
the
argument
which
is
being
imputed
to
us
by
the
defendants...
"but
must
afford
handicapped
persons
equal
opportunity
to
obtain
the
same
result,
to
gain
the
same
benefit
or
to
reach
the
same
level
of
achievement
in
the
most
integrated
setting
appropriate
to
the
person's
needs.
"
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
i
think
they
could
rebut
our
case
by
bringing
in
some
of
the
proof
that's
been
alluded
to
in
some
of
the
questions
of
showing
that
there
are
no
alternatives
that
would
not
have
a
disparate--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--right,
exactly.
i
mean
if...
if
you
can't
avoid
this...
this
impact
on
the
handicapped
regardless
of
what
you
do--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--right.
and
we
don't...
we
don't
contend
that
that
is
necessary
in
this
case.
we
are
suggesting
that
there
are
in
this
case...
again,
each
case
is
context
specific...
in
this
case
there
are
alternatives
which
would
not
require
differential
treatment
of
the
handicapped
or
the
nonhandicapped.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
gets
into
the
question
of...
of
how
far
do
they
clearly
have
some
duty
to
accommodate.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
again,
it...
it
involves
anticipation
of
what--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--there
is
an
affirmative
duty
to
accommodate,
your
honor.
our--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
let
me
just
say
that...
that...
that
the
court
has
already
said
in
southeast
community
college
v.
davis
that
a
fundamental
change
in
the
program--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--there
is
a
duty
to
accommodate,
and
let
me
just
say
that
we
are
at
the
opposite
poll
from
southeast
community
college
v.
davis,
because
the
proof
on
the
record
right
now
is
that
this...
this
impact
is
gratuitous
in
the
sense
that
there
are
other
alternatives
which
would
not
have
this
impact
of
barring
people
from
the
hospital,
and
they've
offered
no...
no
reason.
they're
simply
saying
we
don't
have
to
a
reason.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--i'm...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
well,
what
would
happen
or
remand
if
our
were
to
affirm,
your
honor,
is
that
they
would
be
able
to
come
forward
and
refute
our
case,
if
they
can,
by
putting
on
proof
showing,
a)
that...
and
again,
the
first
question
is
the...
the
record
says
that
we're
not
moot,
but
we
are
muddled
because
there
have
been
changes
in
the
statistical
evidence
since
then
because
of
changes
in
the
program.
they
would
come
back
and
show
the
statistics
are
no
longer
valid.
the
other
thing
that
they
could
do
on
remand
is
come
back
and
say
conceding
the
impact
of
the
cut
to
14
days,
any
of
the
other
alternatives
available
to
us
would
either
have
the
same
disparate
impact
or--
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
--well,
i
think
they
would
have
to
got
with...
with...
with
method
which
has,
absent
other
factors,
which
has
a
lesser
impact
on
the
handicapped.
mr.
g.
gordon
bonnyman,
jr.
thank
you.
