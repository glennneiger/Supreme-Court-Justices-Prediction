justice
rehnquist
mr.
bonnyman,
i
think
general
cody
and
the
solicitor
general
take
the
position
that
if
your
position
is
sustained,
any
across-the-board
reduction
in
hospital
services
would
at
least
be
subject
to
a
prima
facie
finding
and
an
individualized
hearing
in
court
as
to
whether
it
could
be
sustained.
now,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
rehnquist
okay.
now,
what...
what
kind
of
an
across-the-board
reduction
could
tennessee
have
made
in
this
case?
could
it
have
gone
from
20
days
to
18
days?
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
problematic,
you
mean
bad
under
the
sixth
circuit's
decision.
justice
rehnquist
now,
would
that
be
true
if
tennessee
imposed
an
initial
limitation
of
20
days
for
the
first
time
if
it
had
had
no
limitation
before?
justice
rehnquist
well,
now,
how...
how
about
if...
the
court
of
appeals
said,
didn't
it,
that
the...
tennessee
could
have
gotten
by
with
limiting
the
number
of
visits
per
year?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
you
don't
agree
with
that,
do
you?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i'm
trying...
i'm
trying
to
find
out
from
you
exactly
what
the
state
might
have
done
without
having
the
court
of
appeals
decide
it
if
it
had
to
go
to
court
and
sustain
this
on
a
hearing.
how
about
the
number
of
days
per
admission?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but...
but
the
fact
that
many
other
states
use...
use
it
certainly
wouldn't
insulate
it
from
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
in
this
case.
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
true
of
any...
any
limit
on
days
in
the
hospital,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
we
turn
to
number
of
days
per
admission.
now,
couldn't
some
showing
be
made
in
all
probability
that
particular
people,
perhaps
with
different
handicaps
than
those
who
made
their
showing
in
this
case,
would
be
discriminated
against,
in
your
view,
by
limiting
the
number
of
days
per
admission;
the
kinds
who
once
they
have
admission
perhaps
need
a
fairly
long
stay
in
the
hospital?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but,
i...
i'm
not
talking
about
the...
the
plan
that
tennessee
actually
went
with
here.
i'm
talking
about
what
i
thought
was
your
submission
of
a
proper
plan,
which
would
limit
the
number
of
days
per
admission.
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
it
discriminate
against
some
types
of
handicapped
people
who
need
fairly
extensive
stay
in
the
hospital
once
they
get
admitted?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you
reject
that
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
i
take
it.
justice
rehnquist
well,
where--
justice
rehnquist
--where
do
you
come
up
with
this
alternatives,
because
ordinarily
i
would
have
thought
that
if
you...
if
the
statute
requires
a
showing
of
disparate
impact,
you
show
disparate
impact,
coming
up
with
alternatives
which
might
have
been
used
and
instead
the
state
saying
we
have
no
alternative,
then
you
say
well,
all
right,
then
you're
entitled
to
use
this
thing
with
disparate
impact,
that
is
not
the
kind
of
analysis
we
ordinarily
engage
in.
what
you're
arguing
for
sounds
more
like
an
impact
statement
type
of
thing.
the...
show
that
you've
considered
the
problem
of
the
handicapped,
that
you
thought
it
over
and
considered
alternatives
that
might
have
done
better
them.
and
if
you've
considered
it
and
say
they
aren't
feasible,
then
you
can
go
ahead
and
use
something
that
has
disparate
impact.
but
that's
kind
of
a
hodgepodge
of
statutory
requirement.
justice
rehnquist
but
what...
what
makes
you
think
that
the
alternative
you
have
proposed
which,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
limit
on
the
number
of
days
per
admission
but
no
limit
on
the
number
of
admissions
per
year,
that
some
group
of
handicapped
people,
perhaps
unknown
to
you,
couldn't
show
that
that
discriminated
against
them,
because
once
they
got
admitted
they
needed
to
stay
longer
than
most
people,
than
unhandicapped
people?
justice
rehnquist
but
a
limit
on
the
number
of
days
per
admission
would
mean
you're
thrown
out
of
the
hospital
at
the
end
of
six
days.
justice
rehnquist
and
they'll
keep
you
as
long
as
you
have
to
stay?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
really
when
you
say
there
is
a
way
of
doing
it,
it's
a
way
of
doing
it
because
the
hospitals
don't
enforce
what
you
say
they
might
be
entitled
to
enforce.
justice
rehnquist
so
there
really
is...
there
really
is
no
way
of
doing
it.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
your
suggestion
that
there
is
another
limit
that
would
have
some
bite
to
it,
that
would
be
acceptable,
turns
out
on
examination
that
the
limit
would
have
no
bite
to
it
at
all.
justice
rehnquist
well,
you...
you...
you
say
well--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
you
say
the
state
could
have
used
a
limitation
on
the
number
of
days
per
admission,
but
then
as
i
understand
your
response
to
questions,
the...
the
reason
that
works
is
because
the
hospitals
don't
enforce
the
number
of
days
limitation.
