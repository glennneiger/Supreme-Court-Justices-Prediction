mr.
bator--
justice
stevens
--can
i
ask
you
one
question
you
answer
whenever
it's
convenient
in
your
argument?
could
you
state
a
test
of
discrimination
under
this
statute
that...
in...
in
the
shorthand
fashion
in
some
way
that
i
could
tell
whether
it
applies
to
this
case
or
not?
justice
stevens
when
you
say
bars
the
handicapped,
do
you
mean
bars
an
individual
handicapped
person
or
the
class
of
persons
who
fit
the
statutory
definition
of
handicapped?
which
are
you
saying?
justice
stevens
because
here
it
clearly
seems--
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one...
one
other?
equal
opportunity
to
get
what?
justice
stevens
well,
that's...
that's--
justice
stevens
--it's
not
equal
opportunity
to
get
the
health
care
they
need.
obviously
you
lose
if
that's
the
test.
it's
equal
opportunity
to
get
what
tennessee
offers,
as
i
see
it.
justice
stevens
and
if
you
say
equal
opportunity
to
get
what
they've
offered,
it
seems
to
me
you
automatically
win.
justice
stevens
mr.
bonnyman,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
disparate
impact?
in
your
view
does
the
disparate
impact
arise
from
the
fact
that
a
larger
percentage
of
the
people
in
the
handicapped
class
need
hospitalization
for
long
periods
of
time
or,
alternatively,
that
if
you
have
a
person
in
the
handicapped
class
and
one
in
the
nonhandicapped
class
with
the
same
ailment
that
the
nonhandicapped
person
by
virtue
of
his
handicap
will
need
longer
hospitalization?
do
you
understand
what
i'm
asking?
justice
stevens
it's
primarily
the
latter,
that
if--
justice
stevens
--if
a
nonhandicapped
person
and
a
handicapped
person
both
have
pneumonia,
the
handicapped
person
may
need
to
stay
in
the
hospital
longer
than
the--
justice
stevens
--but
perhaps
possibly
for
some
other
ailment
then.
justice
stevens
but,
see,
if
it's
for
some
other
ailment,
then
you'd
really
be
in
the
other
branch
of
my
hypothetical.
justice
stevens
i
mean
if
you're
suggesting...
i
mean
if...
if
your
theory
is
that
handicapped
people
as
a
class
are
more
apt
to
need
hospital
care,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
possibly
lose
the
case.
justice
stevens
even
if
they
go
back
for--
justice
stevens
--yes.
justice
stevens
no
alternatives
except
giving
the
handicapped
people
say
28
days
and
the
nonhandicapped
14.
justice
stevens
you
do
concede
that.
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
two
questions?
first,
you
argued
about...
earlier,
i
think,
about
the
possible
difference
between
the
statutory
command
and
the
regulatory
command
which
might,
at
least
in
my
view,
possibly
go
beyond
the
statute
itself.
do
you
rely
on
a
specific
regulation
in
support
of
your
position,
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
is
there
one
regulation
that
you
think
really
sheds
a
bright
light
on
this
issue?
justice
stevens
84.4.
justice
stevens
(b)(4)?
justice
stevens
you
meant
(b).
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
and
my
second
question
is,
because
i've
never
quite
understood,
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
a
remand.
justice
stevens
let
the
other
side
have
a
chance
to
rebut
your
case.
how
could
they
possibly
rebut
your
case?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
you
would
say
the
statute
or
regulations
would
not
be
violated
even
if
there
is
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
you
rely
on
as
long
as
there's
nothing
they
can
do
about
it.
justice
stevens
well,
you
surely
could
avoid
it
by
giving
them
a
longer
period
in
the
hospital.
you
could
have
an
affirmative
action--
justice
stevens
--but
if
they
prove
they
in
fact
would
result
in
differential
treatment,
then
you
lose
the
case.
justice
stevens
well,
but
that's
quite
a
different
answer
than
you
gave
me
30
seconds
ago.
justice
stevens
well,
which
is
your
position?
is
there
any
affirmative
duty
to
accommodate
or
merely
a
duty
to
prove
you
can't
avoid
discrimination
entirely?
justice
stevens
then
they
can't
possibly
win
the
case.
justice
stevens
then
they
can't
possibly
win
the
case.
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
you're
right.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
your
position.
your
position
is
there
is
a
duty
to
accommodate.
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
not
have
this
impact,
but
i
thought
you
were
going
to...
you
said
they
had
to
prove
that
their
alternatives
would
not
have
any
impact,
any
differential
impact.
justice
stevens
if
you
base
it--
justice
stevens
--i
just
don't
really
know
what
would
happen
on
remand
if
we
were
to
affirm.
i
just
don't...
i
have
an
awful
difficult
understanding
of
exactly
what
your
position
is.
justice
stevens
well,
no,
you
say
here
there's
a
5
percent
disparate
impact
on
the
handicapped
and
1
percent
on
the
nonhandicapped,
as
i...
the
gross
figure.
supposing
they
came
back
and
said
all
right,
we
have
an
alternative
that
would
have
a
3
as
opposed
to
1
percent,
then
who
wins?
it's
the
only
other
alternative.
there's
some
disparate
impact,
but
not
quite
as
severe
as
this
one.
justice
stevens
your
time
has
expired
now,
counselor.
