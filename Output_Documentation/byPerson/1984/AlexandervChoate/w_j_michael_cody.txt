mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
involving
the
interpretation
and
application
of
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973,
which
prohibits
discrimination
against
the
handicapped
in
federally
funded
programs.
at
issue
is
whether
the
tennessee
medicaid
program
discriminated
against
the
handicapped
by
reducing
the
number
of
inpatient
hospital
days
provided
each
medicaid
recipient
in
a
fiscal
year
from
20
until
14.
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
change
did
not
violate
section
504.
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
a
split
decision
found
a
prima
facie
violation
of
section
504,
reversed
and
remanded
in
order
to
allow
the
state
to
rebut
the
prima
facie
case.
the
change
which
the
tennessee
medicaid
program
took
in
this
case
was
an
across-the-board
deduction
in
inpatient
hospital
days
from
14...
from
20
days
to
14
days.
it
excluded
no
one.
it
applied
equally
to
the
handicapped
as
well
as
the
nonhandicapped.
this
change
was
necessary
because
the
tennessee
constitution
prohibits
deficit
spending,
and
our
program
was
in
a
condition
that
it
would
run
out
of
money
unless
certain
changes
were
made
in
order
to
reduce
the
financial
commitment
of
the
state.
and
this
change
itself
was
made
along
with
others
which
made
the
budget
possible
to
have
the
medicaid
program
run
throughout
the
year
and
serve
the
public
recipients.
this
change,
the
state
submits,
was
authorized
by
the
medicaid
statutes
and
the
regulations.
congress
has
given
the
states
discretion
in
setting
benefit
and
service
levels.
there
are
two
restrictions
that
congress
places
on
those
levels
of
services.
first,
the
level
must
be
sufficient
in
amount,
in
duration,
and
in
scope
in
order
to
achieve
the
purpose
of
the
program;
and
secondly,
the
level
must
be
set
equally
for
everyone.
in
addition
to
the
medicaid
law,
the
state
of
tennessee
submits
that
the
charge
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
section
504
and
the
specific
regulations
under
section
504
which
refer
to
benefits
and
services.
the
purpose
of
section
504,
we
submit,
is
the
evenhanded
treatment
of
handicapped,
not
affirmative
action
in
order
to
overcome
disabilities
which
are
caused
by
handicapped.
in
the
regulations
which
particularly
refer
to
benefits
and
services,
the
regulation
says
that
services
are
required
to
be
equally
effective,
but
in
order
to
be
equally
effective,
the
benefits
are
not
required
to
produce
the
identical
result
or
level
of
achievement
for
the
handicapped
and
the
nonhandicapped
persons,
but
must
afford
handicapped
persons
equal
opportunity
to
obtain
the
same
result.
in
order
to
violate
section
504,
we
submit,
we
would
have
had
to
extend
a
lesser
number
of
inpatient
hospital
days
to
the
handicapped
than
to
the
nonhandicapped.
the
district
court
recognized
this
and
found
that
there
was
no
discrimination
under
504
when
an
equal
number
of
hospital
days
were
provided.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
felt
that
a
prima
facie
case
was
made
because
on
the
statistics
introduced,
the
14
days
limitation
was
unable
to
meet
the
hospital
needs
of
the
handicapped
to
the
same
extent
as
the
nonhandicapped.
so
even
if
an
effects
test
is
applied,
a
violation
or
a
prima
facie
violation
of
section
504
requires
a
finding
that
the
handicapped
were
affected
unequally
with
respect
to
some
program
benefit.
here,
the
benefit
which
the
state
is
providing,
the
14
days
of
inpatient
hospital
care,
is
provided
equally
to
all
eligible
for
the
program.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
justice
o'connor,
we
do
not
believe
that
that
would
be
the
result,
and
it's
the
error
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
made.
they...
we
contend
that
the
benefit
which
is
provided
in
this
service
is
a
certain
number
of
inpatient
hospital
days.
and
i
might
add
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out
in
his
brief,
if
you
look
at
the
studies,
the
disproportionate
result
is
even
greater
at
19
days
than
it
is
at
14,
so
the
cut...
the
figures
would
show
that
less
handicapped
needs
proportional
to
nonhandicapped
are
met
at
19
days
than
at
what
we
cut
it
back
to
at
14.
but
what
we
think
the
statute
does
is
it
provides
equal
access
to
the
program,
to
the
benefits,
equal
opportunity
to
receive
those
benefits,
and
not
an
equal
result.
and
that's
what
these
figures
really
are
dealing
with;
that
it
takes
more
hospital
days
to
have
certain
handicappeds
reach
full
recovery
or
to
get
all
of
their
hospital
benefits.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
justice
o'connor,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
did,
and
we...
we
have
made
an
argument
in
our
brief
that--
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
--yes,
there
is,
but
i
think
the
darrone
regulation--
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
--no.
i
think
that...
that
darrone,
the
regulations
there
relate
to
a
different
situation
than
we
have
here.
those
are
specific
employment
regulations.
in
the
benefit
and
services
regulation
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
first,
that
if
you
go
back
to
title
vi
or
section
504
and
look
at
bakke
and
this
court's
majority
opinion
in
guardians,
that
section
504,
as
darrone
indicates,
is
a
mirror
image
of
title
vi,
and
that
title
vi
only
prohibits
intentional
discrimination.
justice
stevens,
i
think,
went
further,
however,
and
said
if...
if
that's
correct,
the
regulations
can
provide
an
effects
test
even
if
the
statute
does
not;
but
he
qualified
that
to
say
if
the
regulations
are
in
furtherance
of
the
statute,
and
that's
where
we
think
there
is
a
problem
here
in
applying
effects
regulations
to
benefits
and
services
afforded.
the
handicapped
are
not
a
homogenous
group
of
people.
there
are
many
different
subtypes
of
handicaps
that
require
tremendous
social
services.
and
in
this
particular
situation,
any
time
that
you
have
users
of
social
welfare
programs
such
as
the
handicapped
in
this
case,
if
you
place
any
limits
on
the
benefit,
you're
going
to
have
this
disproportionate
result
occur.
but
we
contend
that
that
disproportionate
result
is
not
disparity
or
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of...
of
section
504.
and
the
important
consideration,
i
think,
for
the
court
to
see
is
that
504
requires
equal
access
to
the
services.
as
the
respondent
argues,
is
a
person
excluded
from
the
program
when
he
runs
out
of
the
14
days?
isn't
that
lack
of
access
to
the
program,
or
have
we
excluded
that
person
from
the
program?
i
don't
think
that
we
have
when
it
is
merely
a
limit
on
the
program
and
one
which
is
consistent.
when
that
service
runs
out
or
the
benefit
runs
out,
it's
just
been
used
up,
and
it
doesn't
mean
that
that
person
is
excluded
from
the
program.
if
this
case...
if
we
had
to
go
to
a
prima
facie
finding
just
on
the
basis
of
disproportionate
results
that
the
handicappeds
didn't
receive
as
much
health
care
as
they
might
need
and
nonhandicapped
did,
then
you
would
allow
litigants
every
time
that
any
change
is
made
in
a
social
welfare
program
such
as
this,
that
they
could
come
in
and
if
they
are
greater
users,
they
would
show
this
disproportion,
and
the
state
would
have
to
litigate
each
and
every
one
of
those
situations,
and
you
would
find
that
a
very
uncertain
program
would
be
present.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
that's...
that's
right,
justice
white.
we...
we
have
only--
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
--i
think
it's
a
better
way
of
putting
it.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
put
it
better.
and
you
never
even
need
to
reach
these
questions,
because
under
the
alternative
argument
there
is
no
discrimination.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
i
do
not.
