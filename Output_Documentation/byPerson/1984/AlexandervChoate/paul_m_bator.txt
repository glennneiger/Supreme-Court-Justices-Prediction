mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
central
concern
here
is
to
show
why
the
particular
version
of
the
discriminatory
impact
theory
that
was
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
why
that
version
of
this
theory
is
really
quite
radically
wrong.
and
for
that
purpose
i'll
start
out
by
emphasizing
that
this
case
is
not
simply
about
the
validity
of
the
14-day
rule,
or
about
the
validity
of
a
reduction
from
20
to
14
days.
suppose
tennessee
today
abandoned
its
14-day
rule,
went
back
to
its
previous
20-day
rule.
would
this
quarrel
be
over?
not
at
all.
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
record
that
a
rule
that
limits
reimbursements
for
inpatient
hospital
care
to
20
days
has
a
more
severe
differential
impact
on
the
handicapped
than
the
14-day
rule;
that
is
to
say,
the
handicappeds
form
a
larger
percentage
of
those
who
need
more
than
20
days
of
hospitalization
than
of
those
who
need
14
days.
in
fact,
the
odd
thing
about
this
case
is
that
the
higher
the
tennessee
limit
went,
if
tennessee
had
a
60-day
limit,
we
might
get
to
the
point
where
those
who
have
a...
are
excluded
by
such
a
limit
may
constitute
100
percent
of
the
people
with
chronic
and
handicapped
condition.
or
take
the
alternative
that
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
find
attractive,
which
is
to
limit
not
the
number
of
days
of
inpatient
care,
but
the
number
of
admissions.
it
seems
to
the
government
clear
that
that
rule
would
be
incredibly
vulnerable
to
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals,
because
it
would
cut
against
all
of
those
who
suffer
from
those
illnesses
that
need
very
frequent
hospitalizations;
that
is,
people
who
suffer
from
chronic
and
therefore
handicapping
conditions.
and
the
respondents'
own
solution
here,
which
is
to
have
the
limit
set
in
terms
of
the
number
of
days
per
admission,
would
that
rule
not
have
a
disparate
impact
on
the
handicapped
under
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals?
we
don't
think
so.
i
think
if
you
set
a
limit
of
three
days
in
the
hospital
for
an
appendectomy,
or
six
days
in
a
hospital
for
a
heart
bypass,
it
seems
clear
that
that's
most
likely
to
be
insufficient
for
those
who
suffer
from
some
other
complicating
chronic
or
handicapping
condition.
so
the
point
here
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
version
of
the
discriminatory
impact
is
fatal
to
any
across-the-board
attempt
to
limit
or
allocate
medicaid
funds.
any
funding
limit
or
allocation
is
going
to
entail
some
kind
of
differential
in
terms
of
result
on
some
members
of
some
protected
group.
that's
why
we
think
that
there
has
to
be
something
very
fundamentally
wrong
with
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
in
our
brief
we
try
to
clarify
what
has
gone
wrong
here.
we
think
that
analytically
what
has
gone
wrong
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
solve
the
question
of
what
is
discrimination
without
first
analyzing
what
is
the
relevant
program
or
activity
or
benefit
as
to
which
504
prohibits
discrimination.
we
submit
that
that
question
cannot
be
answered
by
reference
to
504.
that
question
must
be
solved
by
looking
at
what
program
tennessee
has
set
up
here
and
what
program
the
medicaid
statute
funds.
the...
tennessee
is
free
to
set
up
whatever
program
it
wants
to.
that
program
must,
of
course,
be
harmonious
with
the
federal
subsidy
statute,
here
the
medicaid
act.
now,
this
is
the
matrix
as
to
which
504
applies,
and
here
we
think
the
relevant
program
or
benefit
which
has
been
undertaken
and
subsidized
is
not
the
satisfaction
of
health
needs,
but
the
provision
of
a
given
level
of
health
services.
now,
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make,
your
honors,
is
that
at
a
conceptual
level
what
is
troubling
here
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
theory
of
discrimination
simply
dissolves
all
possible
distinctions
between
nondiscrimination
on
the
one
hand
and
a
major
affirmative
action
program
to
aid
the
handicapped
on
the
other.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that's
the
very--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--we
feel,
your
honor,
that
insofar
as
the
statute
incorporates
an
impact
test
at
all...
a
question
which
we,
the
government,
has
elided
here...
but
on
that
assumption,
assuming
that
no
intentional
discrimination
needs
to
be
proved,
that
a
discriminatory
impact
within
the
meaning
of
504
exists
only
if
the
effect
of
the
practice
adopted
by
the
state
bars
the
handicapped
from
equal
access
to
or
an
equal
opportunity
to
get
the
benefits
of
the
program.
now,
that
may
sometimes
require
special
measures
for
the
handicapped.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
i
think
either
or--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--either
or
both.
i
think
that
if
the
practice
is
one
which
has
the
effect
of
saying
a
rampless
hospital
does
not
give
the
handicapped
equal
access
to
medicaid
funds.
the
lau
case
establishes--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--we
are
assuming
that
with
that...
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
practice,
intention
need
not
be
shown.
that's
the
assumption
on
which
we
write
our
brief.
but
that's
not
this
case,
because
there
is
no
barring
of
the
handicapped
from
access
to
this
program
or
from
an
equal
opportunity,
unless
you
reduce
equal
opportunity
again
to
what
we
think
is
an
unacceptable
form
of
formulation,
which
is
that
there
must
be
an
equal
satisfaction
of
all
health
maintenance,
that
the
result
has
to
be
exactly
the
same.
now,
as
i
say,
we
do
admit
that
special
measures
for
the
handicapped,
as
the
lau
case
shows,
may
sometimes
be
necessary
in
order
to
create
equal
access
or
an
equal
opportunity;
but
again,
that
is
not
this
case.
i
also
want
to
reassure
the
court
about--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--equal
opportunity
to
receive
the
benefits
that
tennessee
has
provided,
which
is
a
given
measure--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--of
health
care.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that
form
of
words,
justice
stevens,
makes
the
word
"opportunity"
totally
inoperative.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
equal
opportunity
to
take
what
they've
offered
and
that
the
federal
government
has
chosen
to
subsidize.
now,
that
means
that
the
practice
or
measure
adopted
by
tennessee
must
satisfy
the
reasonableness
and
also
the
equality
standards
of
the
medicaid
act,
which
do
very
carefully
provide
that
equal
provision
with
respect
to
scope,
amount,
et
cetera,
of
service
is
required.
so
it
is
not
the
case
that
tennessee
here
is
wholly
free
to
sort
of
gerrymander
the
handicapped
out
of
this
statute.
that
is
not
this
case.
we'll
reserve
the
rest
of
our
time.
