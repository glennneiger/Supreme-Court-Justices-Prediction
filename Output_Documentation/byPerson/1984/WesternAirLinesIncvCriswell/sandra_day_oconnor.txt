justice
o'connor
on
the
instruction
point
concerning
reasonable
factor
other
than
age,
where
in
the
instruction
did
the
court
tell
the
jury
that
it
was
an
affirmative
defense?
justice
o'connor
i
just
didn't
find
anyplace
where
the
trial
judge
said
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
was
an
affirmative
defense
and
that
the
burden
was
on
western
airlines.
and
i
wondered
where
you
could
point
out.
justice
o'connor
so
that
argument
may
fail
simply
because
that
isn't
what
the
judge
instructed.
justice
o'connor
then
you
made
this
argument
that
the
court
had
to
apply
that
mcdonnell
douglas
approach
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.
do
you
think
that
this
court's
opinion
a
few
days
ago
in
twa
versus
thurston
now
forecloses
that
argument?
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
direct
evidence
of
age
discrimination,
so
that
you
have
to
face
it
head-on
rather
than
in
a
mcdonnell
douglas
approach?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
all
we
had
here
were
captains
who
had
reached
the
age
that
precluded
them
from
being
captains.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
booth,
to
try
to
clarify
your
point,
if
i
can,
the
trial
judge
instructed
that,
in
1978
when
these
plaintiffs
were
retired,
the
jury
had
to
find
it
was
highly
impractical
for
western
to
deal
with
each
second
officer
over
60
on
an
individualized
basis
to
determine
his
ability.
now,
you
made
objection
to
that
instruction,
is
that
right,
or
trial
counsel
for
western
made
objection
to
that,
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
and
did
the
clarifying
paragraphs
make
it
clearer
that
it
was
enough
for
the
jury
to
find
that
the
employer
simply
had
a
reasonable
basis
in
fact
to
think
it
was
highly
impractical?
justice
o'connor
but
that's
what
you're
urging
today.
justice
o'connor
you
urge
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
said
the
employer
had
a
reasonable
basis
in
fact
to
believe
it
was
impractical.
justice
o'connor
well,
that
seems
like
a
separate
point,
and
of
course
the
trial
judge
did
instruct
that
safety
was
a
factor.
justice
o'connor
although
you
did
not
propose
the
"perfect
charge"
at
the
time?
justice
o'connor
well,
counsel--
justice
o'connor
--what
about
that
portion
of
the
instruction
dealing
with
the
instruction
that
the
jury
had
to
find
it
was
in
fact
highly
impractical
for
individualized
testing?
justice
o'connor
and
in
the
first
proposed
instruction
they
had
asked
for
the
rational
basis
in
fact
language?
justice
o'connor
so
is
it
your
position,
mr.
wallace,
then
that
there
is
direct
evidence
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age,
and
therefore
the
rfoa
defense
doesn't
apply?
