where
is
that?
justice
white
on
page
79
of
the
joint
appendix
there
are
some
responses
to
requests.
those
are
requests
for
admissions,
i
think.
those
are
just
request
for
admissions,
aren't
they?
i
don't
see
any...
i
guess
it
must
be
in
the
full
record
that's
filed
here.
justice
white
were
they
recorded
or
not?
justice
white
well,
is
what
you're
going
to
tell
us
in
the
record
or
is
it
just
your
memory?
justice
white
you
mean
everything
you
say
is
going
to
be
in
the
record?
justice
white
all
right.
[laughter]
justice
white
could
i
ask
you--
justice
white
--did
western
take
the
position
in
the
trial
court
that
the
reason
they're
insisting
on
a
bfoq
for
the
flight
engineer
was
that
it's
the
training
ground
for
the
captain's
position?
justice
white
because
we
haven't...
i
don't
know
that
we
have
any
cases
that
say
that
a
carrier
can't
adopt
a
scheme
for
training
pilots
that
means,
we're
going
to
take
everybody
in
as
a
flight
engineer,
nobody
can
be
a
pilot
who
hasn't
been
a
flight
engineer,
and
the
flight
engineering
job
is
a
training
ground
for
pilots.
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
that's
what
i
asked
you.
justice
white
it
did
not
assert
it?
justice
white
well,
would
you
say
that
it
could
have
a
progression
line
like
that
and
say,
therefore
all
flight
engineers
that
we
hire
must
meet
the
requirements
of
a
pilot?
justice
white
well,
would
you
say
that...
no,
no.
justice
white
well,
and
they
also
couldn't
be
over
60,
just
like
a
pilot
couldn't
be.
justice
white
so
your
answer
is
that
they
can't
have--
justice
white
--a
flat
rule
against
a
progression?
justice
white
could
they
say,
could
they
have
a
rule
that,
because
the
flight
engineer
is
a
training
seat
for
pilots,
we'll
never
hire
a
flight
engineer
over
60?
justice
white
what
about
your
position
on
that?
justice
white
well,
no.
justice
white
would
it
be
sustainable?
justice
white
could
twa
say,
look,
we're
training
pilots
by
making
them
flight
engineers,
so
we
refuse
to
hire
anybody
as
a
flight
engineer
who's
over
60?
justice
white
because
of
this
progression.
justice
white
well,
it's
related
to
safety
in
the
sense
that
this
is
where
we
get
all
our
pilots,
and
therefore,
if
the
pilot
bfoq
is
related
to
safety,
so
is
this
one.
justice
white
well,
it
might
affect
whether
an
overage
pilot
can
go
take
a
seat
as
a
flight
engineer
that
would
keep
it
away
from
some
younger
man
who
would
be
training
for
a
pilot.
