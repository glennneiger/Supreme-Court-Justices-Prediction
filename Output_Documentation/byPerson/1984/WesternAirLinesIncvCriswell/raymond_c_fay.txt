mr.
raymond
c.
fay
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
initially
explain
to
the
court
what
really
went
on
in
the
district
court
with
regard
to
the
instructions
and
the
various
defenses
that
western
raised,
and
also
provide
just
a
little
bit
of
clarifying
background
about
how
the
instruction
that
judge
tashima
gave
was
constructed.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
yes,
i
did.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i'm
going
to
tell
you
everything
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
backseat
driver
defense,
that
was
not
raised
in
this
case
at
all,
either
as
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
or
as
a
bfoq.
the
record
will
reflect
that
one
of
the
chief
management
officials
was
asked
about
this
on
cross-examination
and
he
explicitly
said
that
western
was
making
no
contention
about
that.
it
has
not
been
raised
in
one
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
supreme
court,
and
the
first
time
i've
heard
of
it
in
this
case
is
today's
oral
argument.
secondly,
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
defense
in
this
case
as
it
was
pleaded,
as
it
was
briefed,
and
as
it
was
tried
related
only
to
the
contractual
restriction
on
down-bidding.
in
fact,
the
reasonable
factors
defense
was
almost
exclusively
based
on
the
arbitration
decision,
which
said
that
the
down-bids
were
improper
under
a
particular
provision
of
the
pilot
agreement,
not
because
the
literal
language
of
the
pilot
agreement
wouldn't
allow
it,
but
because
to
grant
the
bids
to
criswell
and
starley
would
violate
the
company's
policy
against
mandatory
retirement.
there
was
no
argument
in
this
case
about
the
inversion
of
seniority
in
the
cockpit.
there
was
no
evidence
presented
by
western
to
show
that
that
would
be
a
safety
factor
under
either
reasonable
factors
or
bfoq.
now,
with
regard
to
the
instructions,
western
initially
tendered
about
ten
bfoq
instructions,
which
are
identified
in
our
brief.
the
correct
citation
to
the
record
is
number
164
of
the
clerk's
record,
which
is
not
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix.
in
all
of
those
instructions,
the
drift
of
the
instruction
was
that
western
could
prove
a
bfoq
by
articulating
a
rational
basis
for
its
safety
belief
that
a
life
would
be
endangered
by
abandoning
its
policy
of
mandatory
retirement.
it
relied
exclusively
on
the
district
court
opinion
in
the
tuohy
case,
which
was
reversed
by
the
sixth
circuit,
and
it
relied
upon
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
in
greyhound,
which
was
clarified
later
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
orzel
to
fall
in
line
with
tamiami
and
the
test
which
almost
every
court
has
adopted.
now,
after
the
judge--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--yes.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
after
the
judge
made
his
ruling
that
he
was
not
going
to
abide
by
the
tuohy
district
court
ruling,
because
he
said
that
would
take
it
away
from
the
jury,
western
tendered
an
instruction
called
19
alternate.
that
is
contained
in
the
clerk's
record,
number
184.
and
they
state
up
at
the
top:
"this
instruction
is
submitted
only
if
the
court
rejects
the
instruction
based
on
the
rational
basis
in
fact
doctrine
of
greyhound-tuohy.
"
now,
what
jude
tashima
did
is
he
took
the
first
page
of
the
instruction
and
gave
most
of
it.
this
unfortunately
is
my
scratched
copy
from
when
we
sat
in
the
instruction
conference.
and
western
tendered
the
language
that
your
honor
is
referring
to,
the
"highly
impractical"
language.
the
only
change
judge
tashima
made
in
that
part
of
the
instruction
was
to
insert
words
directly
from
the
tamiami
opinion.
in
other
words,
western
had
said:
"in
1978,
when
these
plaintiffs
were
retired,
it
was
not
practical
for
western
to
deal
with
each
second
officer
over
age
60
on
an
individualized
basis.
"
et
cetera.
and
judge
tashima
inserted
the
words
"highly
impractical"
in
the
place
of
"not
practical".
in
other
words--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--that's
correct.
they
also
did
it
in
this
one.
on
the
second
page
of
these
lengthy
instructions,
i
believe
mr.
booth
referred
to
this
as
the
clarifying
language.
well,
the
clarifying
language
would
have,
in
judge
tashima's
ruling,
essentially
directed
the
matter
for
western,
because
it
says,
"if
you
find
that
second
officers
perform
duties
on
a
dc-10
such
that
their
incapacitation
would
to
any
extent
whatever
decrease
the
safety
of
or
increase
the
risk
to
passengers
in
western
aircraft,
then
i
instruct
you
that
you
may
find
that
the
existence
of
the
faa
rule
by
itself
constitutes
a
sufficient
basis
for
you
to
find
that
a
bfoq
existed.
"
et
cetera.
so
in
other
words,
they
had
inserted
on
the
second
page
a
rational
basis
test
again.
judge
tashima
struck
that
out,
but
he
did
give
them
the
state
of
the
art
back
in
1978.
western
had
said,
well,
we
shouldn't
be
held
to
what
medical
science
can
now
do;
we
should
only
be
held
to
what
was
practical
back
in
1978.
he
did
allow
them
to
do
that.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
one
more
item
of
clarification
regarding
the
state
of
the
record.
perhaps
mr.
booth
inadvertently
stated
that
the
bfoq
defense
did
not
apply
to
the
captains.
the
bfoq
defense
was
asserted
against
all
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case.
on
the
down-bidding
issue,
the
refusal
to
allow
the
captains
to
transfer,
that
was
defended
by
various
defenses...
reasonable
factors
other
than
age,
bona
fide
seniority
system,
business
necessity...
at
various
stages
of
the
case,
and
all
of
that
applied
only
to
the
captain
plaintiffs,
criswell
and
starley,
who
sought
to
down
bid.
the
bfoq
instruction
in
this
case
should
be
upheld
for
two
key
reasons.
first,
the
tamiami
bfoq
test,
without
the
adulteration
proposed
by
western
in
its
brief,
satisfies
the
statutory
requirement
of
a
reasonably
necessary
bfoq.
first,
it
requires
reasonableness
in
the
selection
of
the
job
qualifications
which
are
related
to
the
essence
of
the
business,
here
safety;
and
second,
it
requires
necessity
in
the
application
of
the
age
limit,
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
impossible
or
highly
impractical
for
the
employer
to
conduct
the
business
without
the
limit.
that
was
contained
in
the
instruction.
the
tamiami
test
has
worked
well
in
literally
dozens
of
bfoq
cases
and
has
been
embraced
by
every
circuit
to
consider
the
issue.
now,
the
tamiami
test
was
applied
by
judge
tashima
in
this
case
with
two
modifications
which
lightened
western's
tamiami
burden.
first,
instead
of
having
to
prove
that
the
flight
engineer
job
qualifications
and
duties
were
reasonably
related
to
safety,
western
received
a
direction
to
the
jury
that
this
prong,
called
the
diaz
prong
of
the
tamiami
test,
was
met.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
in
the
joint
appendix?
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it's
instruction
number
28,
on
page
61
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
it
states:
"the
bfoq
defense
is
available
only
if
it
is
reasonably
necessary
to
the
normal
operation
essence
of
defendant's
business.
"
"in
this
regard,
i
instruct
you
that
the
normal
operation
essence
of
western's
business
is
the
safe
transportation
of
air
passengers.
"
so
western
did
not
have
to
put
on
any
evidence.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
objected
to
the
court
giving
any
such
instruction
on
the
diaz
prong.
contrary
to
its
argument
here
that
it
wasn't
allowed
to
make
an
argument
in
this
regard,
it
objected
to
the
court
stating
this
part
of
the
statutory
requirement.
there
was
an
additional
modification
in
the
classic
tamiami
test
which
judge
tashima
gave
in
the
instruction
which
also
lightened
western's
burden,
and
that
is
he
omitted
the
part
of
the
tamiami
test
which
would
have
required
western
to
prove
that
it
had
a
factual
basis
to
believe
that
all
or
substantially
all
flight
engineers
over
age
60
could
not
perform
the
job.
so
those
two
elements
were
omitted,
and
that's
really
the
only
reason
why
the
instruction
looks
at
all
different
from
the
tamiami
decision.
in
both
instances
it
lightened
western's
burden.
well,
western
advocated
the
rational
basis
bfoq
test
based
on
the...
principally
on
the
age
60
rule
of
the
faa,
which
applies
to
pilots,
not
flight
engineers,
with
the
gloss
that
it
had
a
duty
under
the
statute
to
perform
its
duties
in
the
highest
degree
of
safety.
well,
reliance
on
the
faa's
age
60
rule
for
a
position
to
which
the
age
60
rule
doesn't
apply
is
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
is
clear
from
this
court's
recent
opinion
in
twa
versus
thurston
that
the
bfoq
must
apply
to
a
particular
position.
so
even
assuming
that
the
faa's
age
60
rule
is
a
bfoq
for
the
captain
or
the
copilot,
the
employer
can't
make
its
bfoq
for
a
different
position
solely
dependent
upon
that.
moreover,
there
is
an
abundance
of
evidence
in
this
record
related
to
the
faa's
regulatory
scheme
and
the
manner
in
which
western
operated
under
that
scheme.
there
was
absolutely
no
limitation
on
the
manner
in
which
western
was
allowed
to
argue
its
business
as
a
regulated
carrier.
in
fact,
all
of
the
evidence
was
given
to
the
jury
in
that
context.
in
final
argument,
western
told
the
jury,
we
have
to
operate
in
the
highest
degree
of
safety.
the
faa's
minimum
standards
and
other
standards
came
into
play,
and
the
ability
of
western
to
exceed
those
standards
in
areas
where
it
thought
it
might
have
a
safety
problem
also
came
into
play.
but
the
jury
was
also
shown
that
there
were
over
200
flight
engineers
at
the
time...
now
there
are
over
500...
who
are
beyond
age
60.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
oral
argument
this
morning
that
the
jobs
are
different
from
carrier
to
carrier.
not
true.
there
was
an
expert
witness
in
this
case
who
testified
that
the
job
is
essentially
the
same,
the
flight
engineer
job
is
essentially
the
same
from
carrier
to
carrier.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
yes.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
not
as
such.
there
was--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
bfoq
argument
that
western
made.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
why
not?
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
because
it
simply
didn't
assert
it.
it
made
a
pass--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--it
did
not.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it
did
make
a
pass
at
saying
that
it
had
a
progression
line,
but
that
was
in
support
of
the
restriction
on
down-bidding.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
well,
in
fact
that
was
the
contractual
requirement
here.
the
flight
engineers
did
not
have
to
be
qualified
to
fly
that
airplane.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
but
they
had
to
have
a
pilot's
certificate.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
well,
that's
just
another...
that's
another
way
of
saying
that
there's
a
flat-out
ban
on
age.
it's
making
the
age
60
rule
for
pilots
a
proxy
for
the
age
limitation
for
flight
engineers.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
they
cannot.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
well,
here,
your
honor,
in
this
record
there
was
no
flat
rule.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
that
argument--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--could
that
argument
be
made?
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i'm
sorry.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i'm
boxed
in
by
this
record,
where
there
were
so
many
exceptions
to
the
progression.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
in
the
abstract?
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
oh,
age
60
hiring.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it
would
still
have
to
be
shown
that
it
was
related
to
safety.
that
fact
alone
would
not
establish
a
bfoq.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
well,
that
would
establish
perhaps
the
first
prong.
they
would
still
have
to
prove
the
second
prong,
and
that
is
that
there
would
not
be
a
basis
to
assess
the
individualized
performance
of
a
new
age
60
flight
engineer
on
an
individualized
basis.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i'm
scratching
my
head
because
i
don't
think
it
exists
in
this
industry.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
the
question
in
the
abstract
is
i
don't
think
it
would
meet
both
prongs
of
the
tamiami
test.
it
might
meet
the
first
prong,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
meet
the
second
one.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
that's
true.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
the
normal
progression
rule
is
the
one
that
western
asserted
in
this
case.
they
said
you
did
have
to
progress,
but
once
you
progress
to
captain
you've
satisfied
that
rule
and
you
were
allowed
to
go
backwards
as
many
times
as
you
needed
or
wanted
to
under
the
existing
rules.
western
had
that
progression
argument,
but
only...
not
as
a
safety
argument,
only
as
an
argument
that
restricted
the
down-bidding.
but
since
there
were
hundreds
of
exceptions
and
people
were
allowed
to
go
backwards
if
they
had
a
medical
disqualification,
for
example--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--well,
the
up-or-out
was
a
very
limited
one
here,
and
once
you
made
captain,
as
criswell
and
starley
did,
they
were
allowed
to
go
backwards
as
many
times
as
they
wanted.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i
don't
believe
it
affects
the
case
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
which
is
not
this
case.
i
would
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
it
would
not
affect
this
case.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
he
does
not.
under
section
24(d)
of
the
pilot
agreement,
he
goes
immediately
to
flight
engineer.
on
this
record
there
was
a
56-year-old
dc-10
captain
who
had
had
a
heart
problem
and
came
back
as
a
flight
engineer
and
was
flying
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
he
was
not
qualified
to
fly
as
a
captain
any
more
because
of
the
medical
requirements.
similar
to
what
there
was
in
twa,
there
were
also
bumpbacks
here.
there
were
bumpbacks
recounted
in
the
record
and
they're
printed
in
the
joint
appendix.
there
were
disciplinary
downgrades,
which
weren't
even
addressed
in
the
contract.
if
the
company
wanted
to
punish
someone,
they
made
him
down-bid
or
downgrade
for
a
while.
so
the
factual
situation
on
that
score
was
markedly
similar
to
twa.
if
anything,
the
facts
were
stronger
here
because
starley
actually
had
his
down-bid
under
the
contracts
and
the
company
cancelled
the
bid,
and
the
chief
pilot
at
the
trial
admitted
that
they
singled
him
out
and
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
age.
and
then
when
he
went
to
arbitration,
the
arbitrator
found
that,
yes,
the
literal
language
of
the
contract
would
allow
you
to
down-bid,
but
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
to
do
it
to
get
around
the
mandatory
retirement
rule.
so
that
is
just
another
reason
why
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
scheme
that
we
have
here
is...
the
argument
that
they
make
here
is
foreclosed
by
twa,
because,
as
in
twa,
we
have
a
facially
discriminatory
policy...
age
60
captains
were
the
only
ones
who
were
not
allowed
to
down-bid
in
any
circumstances...
and
secondly,
that
there
was
a...
and
secondly,
that
the
bona
fide
seniority
system
would
not
have
been
a
defense.
by
the
way,
in
this
case
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
defense
was
just
one
of
a
number
of
defenses
western
asserted
to
stop
the
down-bidding,
and
on
all
the
other
ones...
for
example,
bona
fide
seniority
system
and
business
necessity...
there
was
no
question
that
western
had
the
burden
of
proving
that,
because
behind
it
was
this
age-bases
selection
policy,
that
once
you
were
60
you
could
not
down-bid.
0....
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
