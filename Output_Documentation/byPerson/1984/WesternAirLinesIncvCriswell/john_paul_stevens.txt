justice
stevens
mr.
booth,
can
i
ask
you
kind
of
a
basic
question
that
puzzles
me
a
little.
i've
had
a
little
trouble
focusing
on
the
issues
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
there's
some
tension
between
arguing
on
the
one
hand
that
the
discrimination
was
based
on
a
factor
other
than
age,
your
first
basic
argument,
and
secondly
arguing
that
it
was
based
on
age,
but
it
was
a
bfoq.
justice
stevens
i
see,
one
applies
to
one
set
of
plaintiffs
and
the
other
applies
to
the
other.
justice
stevens
your
objection
there
is
to
the
form
of
the
instruction
which
placed
the
burden
of
proof
on
you?
justice
stevens
you
say
that,
even
though
it's
an
affirmative
defense,
you
apply
the
mcdonnell
douglas
approach.
that's
your
basic
argument.
justice
stevens
mr.
booth,
can
i
interrupt
again.
i
don't
know
why,
i
had
a
little
difficulty
getting
focused
on
the
issues
in
this
case.
but
if
you
are
right
about
your
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
and
they
had
a
right...
or
assume
they
had
a
right,
you
had
a
right
to
refuse
to
let
them
bid
down,
but
you
would
have
discharged
them
at
age
60
anyway,
because
i
presume
your
age
60
rule
would
have
applied.
how
is
there
any
damage
at
stake
on
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
issue?
i
don't
quite
understand
how
that
could
affect
the
ultimate
outcome
anyway,
because
if
you
lose
on
the
bfoq
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
ballgame?
justice
stevens
but
i
don't
see
how
a
captain
could
possibly
have
suffered
injury
by
being
forbidden
to
bid
down
if
he
was
going
to
get
fired
when
he
was
60
anyway.
justice
stevens
because
he
would
presumably
earn
more
money
as
a
captain.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
they
would
have
been
fired
when
they
reached
their
sixtieth
birthday
anyway.
justice
stevens
that's
right.
but
it
wouldn't
have
done
them
any
good
if
you
win
on
the
bfoq.
justice
stevens
i
just
don't
understand
how
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
can
possibly
determine
anybody's
rights,
that
issue
in
this
case.
maybe
i
missed
something.
justice
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
stevens
but
it
would
be
two
or
three
years
at
a
lower
salary.
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
want
to
try
it
on
that
issue
if
you're
going
to
lose
anyway
on
the
bfoq
issue.
i'm
not
saying
you
do
lose,
but
i
just
frankly
don't
quite
understand.
well,
anyway,
go
ahead.
justice
stevens
mr.
booth,
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
does
the
record
before
us
contain
your
objections
to
the
trial
court's
instructions
on
bfoq?
justice
stevens
well,
my
question
is
did
you,
after
it
was
made
or
after
you
knew
what
it
was
going
to
be,
make
objections
to
it?
justice
stevens
can
i
find
them
in
the
record.
could
you
help
me
find
them
in
the
record
if
i
were
to
look
for
them?
justice
stevens
and
did
you
propose
a
different
instruction
and
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
stevens
but
somebody
representing
your
client.
justice
stevens
and
where
are
the
instructions
that
your
client
proposed
on
bfoq?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
what
happens
to
a
flight
engineer
who
has
a
medical
certificate
good
enough
to
be
a
flight
engineer,
but
is
not
physically
qualified
to
be
a
pilot?
does
he
lose
his
job?
justice
stevens
of
course,
he
couldn't
be
training,
obviously,
for
the
pilot
job.
