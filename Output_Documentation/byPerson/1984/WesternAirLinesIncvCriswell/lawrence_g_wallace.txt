mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
to
clarify
what
this
case
is
about
factually,
on
page
a-42
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
in
the
district
court's
factual
findings
the
court
mentions
that
western
has
permitted
down-bids
or
downgrades
by
more
than
400
pilots.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
pilots
younger
than
age
60
have
not
been
allowed
to
downgrade.
many
of
these
occurred
during
outbacks
of
operations,
but
others
were
for
medical
reasons,
several
pilots
who
no
longer
qualified
to
get
a
medical
certificate
that
enabled
them
to
be
pilots.
so
factually
the
case
is
very
similar
to
the
twa
case
decided
last
week
with
respect
to
this
disparity.
in
fact,
the
court
found
that
the
only
circumstance
in
which
western
has
consistently
denied
down-bids
is
by
captains
nearing
age
<sixty>
[=
60],
and
there
was
no--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct,
just
as
there
was
in
the
twa
case.
in
this
case
it
was
admitted
that
all
second
officers
had
to
retire
at
age
60.
that's
obviously
direct
evidence
of
an
age-based
involuntary
retirement
requirement.
and
there
was
no
instance
in
the
record
in
which
anyone
disqualified
to
continue
as
a
pilot
was
not
allowed
to
down-bid
or
downgrade
except
those
who
were
nearing
age
60,
who
would
be
affected
by
the
mandatory
retirement
requirement.
so
i
think
the
suggestion
that
has
been
made
by
justice
stevens,
that
the
case
basically
turns
on
the
bfoq
question,
is
correct.
and
with
respect
to
that,
the
legal
question
of
some
significance
in
the
case
has
to
do
with
interpretation
of
the
bfoq
requirement,
a
now
familiar
phrase
in
the
law,
but
one
that
originated
with
title
vii
of
the
1964
act
and
was
carried
forward
into
the
age
discrimination
act
in
substantially
identical
language.
this
court
in
dothard
against
rawlinson
referred
to
the
bfoq
as
a
"extremely
narrow
exception",
because
in
both
statutes
it
permits
the
very
conduct
that
the
act
generally
prohibits.
on
its
face...
and
we
have
quoted
the
relevant
provision
from
the
ada
on
page
22
of
our
brief...
the
bfoq
on
its
face
strongly
suggests
that
an
objective
standard
is
to
be
applied.
it
says
that
action
otherwise
prohibited
may
be
taken
where
age
is
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
reasonably
necessary,
where
it
is
reasonably
necessary
to
the
normal
operation
of
the
particular
business.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
congress
did
choose
to
bring
juries
into
the
enforcement
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
a
factual
inquiry,
and
obviously
if
someone
is
going
to
decide
that
he
comes
within
an
extremely
narrow
exception
to
the
act,
he
better
do
so
with
assurance
that
he
has
evidence
that
will
stand
up
in
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
recognize
that,
and
safety
considerations
are
definitely
relevant.
they're
part
of
the
evidence
in
one
of
these
cases.
congress
did
not
preclude
them
from
being
taken
into
account.
they
were
argued
in
this
case.
the
instructions
to
the
jury
accommodated
them.
but
congress
did
not
set
up
a
separate
standard
when
safety
was
involved.
safety--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
do
not
think
that
is
the
statutory
standard,
justice
o'connor.
the
formulation
of
the
legislative
history
that
we
quote
on
pages
8
and
9
of
our
brief
can
be
read
consistently
with
the
face
of
the
statute,
which
proposes
an
objective
standard.
in
the
words
of
senator
javits,
who
is
explaining
it,
it's
that
when
it
can
be
proved
that
the
employer
can
demonstrate
that
there
is
an
objective
factual
basis
for
believing.
now,
there
is
a
possible
ambiguity,
whether
you'd
read
that
that
he
had
a
basis,
an
objective
factual
basis
for
believing,
or
whether
you
read
it
that
the
finder
of
fact,
it's
demonstrated
to
the
finder
of
fact
that
there
is
an
objective
factual
basis
for
believing.
and
the
more
reasonable
reading,
in
light
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
is
that
an
objective
standard
is
to
apply,
since
the
words
of
the
statute
present
an
objective
standard
and
the
whole
idea
that
congress
had
in
both
title
vii
and
the
age
discrimination
act
was
that
persons
were
being
excluded
from
employment
without
an
adequate
basis
in
fact
and
that
this
discrimination
should
be
ended,
and
the
affirmative
defense
should
not
be
read
to
defeat
the
statutory
purpose.
in
this
case
there
never
were
safety
considerations
introduced
as
a
reason
at
the
outset
for
terminating
these
people.
it
was
argued
as
a
basis
for
establishing
a
bfoq
once
the
case
came
to
trial,
but
it
wasn't
the
reason
given
to
these
people
for
their
termination.
and
it's
quite
possible,
in
looking
at
this
record,
to
think
that
safety
considerations
might
be
better
served
if
the
employer
were
to
apply
more
medical
tests
to
all
of
the
flight
engineers.
when
one
notices
the
number
of
cases
involving
cockpit
crews
that
have
been
litigated
and
the
fact
that
the
airline
pilots
association,
unlike
other
unions,
has
been
more
resistant
to
the
application
of
this
statute
in
its
particular
industry
in
comparison
with
its
application
elsewhere,
at
first
my
reaction
was
that,
well,
perhaps
they're
really
trying
to
support
opportunities
for
the
younger
pilots
to
make
bids
for
more
desirable
jobs
sooner.
but
what
this
record
suggests
and
some
others
is
another
possibility,
and
i
can't
say
that
there
is
direct
evidence
on
it.
but
the
provisions
of
the
agreement
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix
starting
at
page
76
show
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
restricts
the
medical
tests
that
can
be
given
to
those
required
by
the
faa,
and
there
are
other
concerns
shown
by
the
employer
here
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
the
union
to
agree
to
additional
medical
tests
being
given.
and
what
is
suggested
by
this
is
a
concern
that
perhaps
some
of
the
younger
employees
who
are
not
yet
eligible
for
pension
benefits
would
not
pass
additional
medical
tests
if
the
need
to
employ
the
older
persons
who
don't
want
to
retire
were
to
result
in
the
need
to
give
additional
medical
tests
to
all
of
the
flight
engineers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
union
was
not
a
party
in
this
case
and
no
one
from
the
union
testified.
but
the
collective
agreement
is
in
evidence
and
there
is
testimony
concerning
the
difficulty
that
the
airline
might
have
in
getting
additional
medical
tests.
so
it's
quite
possible
to
read
this
record
as
suggesting
that
safety
concerns
would
be
better
served
if
additional
tests
were
given
to
all
of
these
flight
engineers,
those
over
age
60
and
the
others,
and
that
the
concern
for
safety
may
not
cut
in
just
one
direction.
my
time
has
expired.
