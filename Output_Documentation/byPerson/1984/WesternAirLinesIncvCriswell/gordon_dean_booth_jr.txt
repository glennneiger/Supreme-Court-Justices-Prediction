mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
according
to
the
order
granting
certiorari
in
this
case,
this
matter
is
before
the
court
for
you
to
decide
the
proper
burden
of
proof
in
connection
with
a
defense
of
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
arising
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act,
as
well
as
the
appropriate
standard
for
establishing
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification,
a
bfoq,
under
the
same
act
in
a
situation
where
the
safety
of
third
parties
is
involved.
petitioner
will
limit
its
comments
to
those
legal
issues.
petitioner
understands
that
this
case
is
not
before
the
court
on
any
issue
involving
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
below
or
the
nature,
quality
or
quantity
of
such
evidence,
and
therefore
will
not
comment
on
the
evidence
except
where
necessary
to
clarify
its
positions
or
concepts.
of
course,
petitioner
relies
on
the
record
and
the
briefs,
and
does
not
concede
any
evidentiary
questions--
the
federal
aviation
administration
sets
minimum
safety
standards
for
air
carriers.
it
does
not
in
any
way
attempt
to
set
safety
standards
as
such,
but
leaves
to
the
carriers
the
methods,
approaches,
procedures
and
techniques
that
allow
them
in
each
of
their
own
judgments
to
maximize
safety.
the
carriers
do
in
fact
operate
with
substantially
different
approaches
and
philosophies.
the
flight
engineer's
job,
for
example,
is
different
from
carrier
to
carrier,
particularly
in
the
training
aspects
and
emergency
procedures
and
in
the
airlines'
approach
to
the
management
of
flight,
whether
the
carrier
utilizes
a
coordinated
crew
approach
to
flying.
some
carriers
treat
their
flight
engineer's
job
as
a
lifetime
position.
others,
among
them
western,
hire
only
pilots
and
do
not
hire
those
only
qualified
to
be
flight
engineers,
and
treat
the
flight
engineer
or
second
officer
slot
as
an
entry
level
job
on
a
line
of
progression
leading
to
pilot.
of
course,
all
common
carriers
own
their
passengers
a
duty
of
extraordinary
care.
this
is
not
a
new
concept,
but
rather
has
been
the
standard
for
many,
if
not
hundreds,
of
years.
it
is
viewed
as
fair
and
reasonable.
the
carrier
is
in
control
of
the
situation.
the
carrier
has
superior
knowledge
and
experience
by
virtue
of
being
in
the
business,
and
therefore
is
in
the
best
position
to
know
and
to
assess
the
risk
involved.
the
carrier
delivers
this
care
through
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
of
small
decisions,
decisions
regarding
the
manner
of
operation,
the
type
of
equipment
to
be
used,
the
manner
of
repair,
maintenance
and
replacement
of
equipment,
schedules
and
the
speeds
required
to
be
utilized
to
meet
those
schedules,
as
well
as
decisions
regarding
the
competence
level
required
of
employees,
the
training
required,
the
proficiency
required,
and
other
personnel
decisions,
all
involving
human
skills,
human
weaknesses,
and
human
abilities...
decisions
which,
taken
together,
allow
the
carrier
to
predict
a
safe
operation.
all
of
these
decisions
are
made
subject
to
the
requirement
that
the
carrier
operate
to
an
extraordinary
level
of
care.
the
airline
common
carriers
are
charged
by
statute
with
the
duty
to
make
their
decisions
so
as
to
maximize
safety,
to
operate
in
the
highest
degree
of
safety
in
the
public
interest.
in
practice,
all
common
carriers
probably
strive
to
meet
that
standard.
all
try
to
make
decisions
in
such
a
way
that
a
safe
operation
is
predictable.
it
is
also
a
federal
law
that
employment
and
other
personnel
decisions
shall
not
be
made
in
such
a
way
as
to
arbitrarily
discriminate
among
people
based
on
their
age.
and
it
is
also
the
common
experience
of
mankind
that
certain
abilities
and
capacities
diminish
with
age.
the
difficulty
is
with
adequately
measuring
or
predicting
such
diminution
in
an
appropriate
way.
and
this
case
involves
those
questions.
there
are
two
sets
of
plaintiffs.
some
were
captains
who
sought
to
become
second
officers
as
they
approached
age
60.
the
second
officer
is
the
most
junior
person
in
the
cockpit.
he
occupies
the
flight
engineer
position.
it
is
the
entry
level
job.
some
of
the
plaintiffs
were
part
of
a
group
of
ten
second
officers
who
in
1962
were
permitted
to
remain
as
second
officers
as
an
exception
to
the
company's
up-or-out
policy
normally
applied
to
the
second
officer,
first
officer,
captain
line
of
progression.
these
second
officers
wanted
to
continue
as
second
officers
after
reaching
age
60.
as
to
the
captain
group
of
plaintiffs,
the
defendant
asserted
that
such
bids
would
invert
the
normal
seniority
in
the
cockpit
by
allowing
the
most
senior
person
in
the
cockpit
to
become
the
most
junior
in
the
chain
of
command.
the
company
has
a
firmly
established
up-or-out
policy
for
safety
reasons,
and
the
inversion
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
policy.
the
company
asserted
that
the
plaintiff
captains
had
no
right
to
make
such
bids,
as
they
were
not
allowed
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
no
captains
were
allowed
to
make
such
bids
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
company
advanced
this
as
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
under
the
adea.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
this
is
only
captain
plaintiffs.
these
plaintiffs
had
been
captains
and
they
had
been
around
longer
than
anybody
in
the
cockpit.
the
people
who
were
career
flight
engineers
didn't
know
how
to
fly
the
airplane.
they
wouldn't
have
any--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
a
lot
of
carriers,
not
all
of
them
but
a
lot
of
carriers,
feel
very
strongly
that
the
most
senior
person
in
the
cockpit
should
be
the
captain,
the
next
most
senior
person
should
be
the
copilot,
and
the
most
junior
person
should
be
the
flight
engineer.
about
half
of
the
carriers
treat
the
flight
engineer's
job
as
a
training
seat
leading
to
the
job
of
copilot,
and
then
from
copilot
to
captain.
so
if
a
captain
were
to
go
down
and
become
a
flight
engineer,
you
would
have
a
situation
where
the
most
senior
person
in
the
cockpit
would
be
the
most
junior
person
in
the
chain
of
command.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
well,
there's
a
strong
feeling
among
a
lot
of
carriers
that
having
someone
who
has
been
a
captain
become
in
a
subordinate
position
is
bad
for
command.
a
coordinated
crew
command
concept
presupposes
that
the
crew
will
react
like
the
fingers
on
your
hand
do
to
a
single
stimulus,
and
the
crew
is
trained
to
handle
emergencies
and
routine
flight
in
that
way.
there
is
a
powerful
feeling
in
the
industry,
which...
i'm
giving
now
the
reason
the
company
gave,
which
i'm
not
sure
a
reasonable
factor
has
to
meet
the
standard
of
bfoq.
but
in
any
event,
the
reason
is
they
feel
that
it's
like
a
backseat
driver
or
somebody's
grandmother.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
that's
right,
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
cockpit.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
that
is
not
the
view
of
all
airlines.
not
all
airlines,
your
honor,
have
a
line
of
progression.
some
airlines
allow
people
to
stay
flight
engineers
their
whole
careers,
so
they
would
never
move
up.
and
some
airlines,
a
minority
but
a
substantial
minority,
have
allowed
captains
to
go
back
and
occupy
that
seat.
but
all
the
training
procedures
are
different
among
the
carriers,
too.
their
approach
to
emergency
management
and
the
approach
to
flight
are
also
different.
so
you
really
have
to
investigate
the
way
they
treat
their
circularity
or
the
seniority
list
with
the
way
they
approach
flying
airplanes
in
toto.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
he
would
be--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--your
honor,
he
would
be
dealt
with...
i'm
not
sure
that's
true,
first.
everybody
has
a
tendency
to
accommodate
to
some
other
human
being's
views
if
you
sense
that
somebody
doesn't
appreciate
what
you're
doing.
nobody
likes
to
have
somebody
read
over
their
shoulder.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true.
but
even
if
it
were
true,
your
honor,
the
question
is,
if
it
were
a
critical
time,
if
it
were
an
emergency
situation,
which
the
evidence
in
other
cases
has
been
is
the
time
that
it's
most
likely
to
occur,
you
might
not
have
an
opportunity
to
punish
him
later.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
the
other
airlines
have
not
experienced
any
known
difficulty
with
it,
those
who
have
tried
it.
but
the
simple
fact
that
a
risk
has
been
successfully
endured
doesn't
mean
it's
not
been
endured.
i
don't
know
how
much
time
we
need
to
know--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
the
point
of
this
is
that,
as
to
the
ex-captain
plaintiffs,
the
company
advanced
this
as
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age.
the
point
in
this
case
is
the
judge
then
ordered
the
company
that
it
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
point.
that's
i
think
all
that's
before
this
court
today,
is
whether
or
not
the
burden
of
proof
should
have
been
on
the
company
or
on
the
plaintiffs.
the
defendants
asserted
to
the
other
group...
that
is,
the
people
who
had
stayed
second
officers...
that
age
60
was
a
60,
and
that
there
was
at
present
an
inability
to
distinguish
those
who
as
a
consequence
of
their
aging
constituted
a
threat
to
safety.
thus,
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
defense
only
applies
to
those
plaintiffs
who
were
captains,
and
the
bfoq
defense
at
that
time
only
applied
to
second
officers.
addressing
the
bfoq
issue,
all
parties
to
this
case
agree
that
the
leading
case
at
this
time
which
has
considered
the
bfoq
question
before
the
court
today
is
usery
versus
tamiami,
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
1976.
the
court
considered
the
exception
contained
in
the
adea,
which
allows
an
employer
to
consider
age
where
it
is
a
bfoq,
in
the
light
of
the
carrier's
obligation
and
duty
to
operate
as
safely
as
possible.
its
opinion
taken
as
a
whole,
it
is
submitted,
properly
and
fairly
balanced
the
interplay
of
these
concurrent
obligations
at
the
point
where
they
may
and
from
time
to
time
do
conflict.
petitioner
believes
that
tamiami,
taken
as
a
whole,
directs
what
the
policy
ought
to
be.
indeed,
the
decision
has
been
cited
with
approval
or
followed
or
claimed
to
have
been
followed
by
all
of
the
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
there
are
two
different
sets
of
plaintiffs.
under
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--right,
your
honor.
no
captains,
regardless
of
age,
were
allowed
to
bid...
to
invert
the
seniority
list
in
the
cockpit
by
bidding
down
to
flight
engineer.
that's
the
defense
the
company
asserted.
it
didn't
make
any
difference
how
old
you
were.
if
you
were
a
captain
you
couldn't
do
that.
so
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
age.
whether
it
was
reasonable
or
not,
justice
marshall
was
addressing,
but
we
just
want
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
under
the
proper
standard.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
well,
i'll
address
that
in
a
moment,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
it's
an
affirmative
defense.
it
has
none
of
the
characteristics
historically
at
common
law
of
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
i
thought
somebody
might
ask
that.
if
you
read
charge
paragraphs
17,
23
and
30,
taken
together,
what
the
judge--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--sorry,
your
honor.
it's
in
the
appendix.
i
don't
have
the
citation
to
the
appendix.
it's
the
judge's
charge
to
the
jury.
he
said
what
the
defenses
were
and
then
he
said
what
defenses
were
affirmative
defenses
and
the
burden
of
proof,
and
then
he
said
that
this
was--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--you're
quite
right,
your
honor,
it
is
nowhere
in
there
stated
as
that.
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
put...
to
dovetail
the
three
paragraphs.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
it's
conceivably
possible
that
that's
true.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
in
that
case
as
i
understand
it,
twa
had
a
policy
which
allowed
people
of
a
certain
classification
to
do
things,
but
it
didn't
allow
everyone
in
that
classification
to
do
things.
this
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
applied
to
every
captain
who
would
have
sought
to
do
what
these
captains
did.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
not
all
the
captains
are
even
40.
they're
not
even
in
the
protected
group.
this
rule
applied
to
all
captains.
it
didn't
make
any
difference
how
old
you
were.
i
don't
see
how
you
would
get
a
head-on
kind
of
discrimination
by
having
a
rule
that
applied
to
all
captains,
period.
i
mean,
in
the
case
no
one
was
allowed
to
bid.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
when
these
people
bid
they
were
not
60.
they
were
approaching
60,
but
they
weren't
60.
and
they
sought
to
bid
down,
as
any
other
captain
would
have
done
in
the
population
pool
of
captains
at
that
time.
all
of
the
courts
of
appeal
which
have
considered
the
tamiami
case,
as
i
was
saying,
have
cited
it
with
approval
since
1976.
all
of
the
parties
before
the
court
today
urge
it
or
parts
of
it
on
this
court
as
helpful
in
aiding
this
court
in
reaching
a
resolution
of
the
bfoq
issue.
the
court
in
tamiami
did
not
purport
to
be
drafting
a
jury
charge,
but
instead
was
setting
forth
the
methodology
to
be
utilized
and
the
requirements
to
be
met
in
connection
with
an
employer's
proof
of
a
bfoq
defense
in
a
case
involving
safety.
it
reviewed
two
requirements
it
had
established
earlier
in
<bfoq>
[=
bfoq]
cases
not
involving
safety
of
third
parties.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
as
to
this
population
of
plaintiffs
i
don't
know,
but
i
would
assume
that
all
of
them
are
60
by
now.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
well,
i
think,
your
honor--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--they
earn...
the
flight
engineer
earns
60
percent
of
what
a
captain
earns.
what
they
sought
was
to
position
themselves
as
a
flight
engineer--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--because
if
they
had
the
right
to
bid
down
under
the
seniority
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
company
has
to
train
them.
so
that
most
of
these
captains
may
never
have
been
flight
engineers
or
they
might
not
have
a
current--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--well,
of
course
they
were
trying
to
position
themselves
to
argue
that
that
was--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--well,
of
course,
your
honor--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--well,
maybe
only
two
or
three
years'
rights,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
it
may
be
only
two
or
three
years'
rights,
but
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--of
course.
your
honor,
i
want
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
all
we
seek
here
is
to
have
the
case
tried
under
a
proper
burden
of
proof
charge
to
the
jury.
i
don't
think
that
we're
here
before
this
court
today
trying
to
convince
you--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--well,
actually
i
viewed
this
as
the
introduction
to
the
facts,
your
honor.
as
i
was
saying,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
employer
must
demonstrate
that
the
qualification
be
reasonably
related
to
the
employer's
business
and
that
the
employer
prove
that
he
had
a
factual
basis
for
believing
that
all
or
substantially
all
persons
excluded
would
be
unable
to
perform
safely
and
efficiently
the
duties
of
the
job
involved,
or
demonstrate
that
it
is
impossible
or
highly
impractical
to
deal
with
the
excluded
persons
on
an
individualized
basis.
the
court
then
discussed
refinements
to
be
considered
in
a
case
where
safety
was
involved.
the
court
observed:
"the
greater
the
safety
factor,
measured
by
the
likelihood
of
harm
and
the
probable
severity
of
that
harm
in
case
of
an
accident,
the
more
stringent
may
be
the
job
qualifications
designed
to
ensure
in
that
case
safe
driving.
"
"we
believe
that
courts
must
afford
employers
substantial,
though
not
absolute,
discretion
in
selecting
specific
safety
standards
and
in
judging
their
reasonableness.
"
the
court
concluded
by
saying
that:
"in
the
safety
area,
the
employer
must
be
afforded
substantial
discretion
in
selecting
specific
standards
which,
if
they
err
at
all,
should
err
on
the
side
of
preservation
of
life
and
limb.
"
"the
employer
must,
of
course,
show
a
reasonable
basis
for
its
assessment
of
risk
of
injury
or
death.
"
"we
think
the
safety
factor
should
be
evaluated
in
terms
of
the
possibility
or
lack
of
it
of
injury
or
death.
"
we
suggest
to
you
that
in
cases
involving
considerations
of
public
safety
an
appropriate
standard
would
be
to
require
the
employer
to
show:
first,
that
the
duties
of
the
job
in
question
are
related
to
the
essence
of
the
business;
and
secondly,
that
the
qualifications
selected
by
the
employer
for
that
job
are
reasonable
in
light
of
the
safety
risk;
and
that
there
is
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe...
that
is,
a
factual
basis
for
believing...
either
that
most
persons
excluded
by
the
challenged
age
limitation
do
not
possess
the
selected
qualifications
or
that
it
is
impossible
or
impractical
to
deal
with
such
persons
on
an
individual
basis,
thereby
justifying
a
reasonable
general
rule;
and
further,
that
where
the
purpose
of
a
challenged
employment
policy
is
to
promote
safety
and
minimize
risk
of
injury
to
third
parties,
the
employer
should
be
afforded
flexibility
and
discretion
in
selecting
specific
safety
standards
and
in
judging
their
reasonableness.
petitioner
submits
that
these
requirements
are
totally
consistent
with
the
opinion
in
tamiami
and
with
the
better
reasoned
decisions
following
tamiami.
this
court,
of
course,
is
not
bound
by
tamiami
nor
its
progeny.
petitioner
submits
that,
whatever
test
this
court
devises
for
use
in
cases
involving
safety
consideration,
that
this
court
should
accord
the
employer
flexibility
and
properly
restrained
discretion
in
selecting
job
qualifications
stringent
enough
to
ensure
safety.
the
charge
given
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case
did
not
afford
western
any
flexibility
or
discretion
in
selecting
job
qualifications
for
the
position
of
second
officer.
moreover,
it
did
not
permit
western
to
make
a
conservative
management
decision
when
faced
with
substantial
conflicting
medical
evidence
concerning
the
efficacy
of
medical
individual
tests.
every
court
which
has
considered
the
issue
of
safety
and
the
bfoq
claim
has
concluded
that
some
leeway,
some
margin
for
error,
is
to
be
afforded
the
employer,
except
the
lower
courts
in
this
case.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
there
were
numerous
discussions
between
the
court
and
the
parties
as
to
the
different
bfoq's
that
were
given...
i
mean,
strike
that...
that
were
proposed
for
charges.
and
this
charge
was
not
anybody's
charge,
so
i
think
the
objection--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
the
objections
were
continually
made.
i
honestly
don't
know
what
specific
objections--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't
know.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
different
instructions
that
were
proposed
were
in
the
record.
i
didn't
try
the
case,
but
by
the
trial
lawyers.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
where
are
they
shown
in
the
record?
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
have
the
citations
for
the
record.
i
can
furnish
it
to
the
court,
but
i
don't
have
it
here
with
me.
the
charge
given--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--in
the
full
record,
your
honor.
must
of
the
actual
discussions
involving
the
charge
and
the
arguments
took
place
in
chambers.
so
what's
in
the
record--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--your
honor,
a
lot
of
that
was
not
recorded.
what
is
recorded
is
the
different
proposals
and
the
results
and
the
kind
of
distillation.
i
don't
think
the
charge
the
judge
gave
was
requested
by
anybody.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
the
complete
jury
instructions
in
the
appendix.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
was
that
instruction
to
the
subsets
of
that
instruction.
that
particular
language
was
included
in
a
request
made
by
western,
but
after
that
language
there
were
two
or
three
paragraphs
involving
how
that
was
to
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
safety
obligation
of
the
carrier
and
its
duties,
and
those
paragraphs
were
not
given.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
the
clarifying
language
approached
the
problem
by
saying
that
the
jury
could
adjust
the
impracticality
factor
by
considering
the
safety
obligations
and
the
safety
responsibilities.
that's
what
the
following
paragraphs
did.
they
didn't
approach
it
by
saying
per
se
that
western
had
to
prove
that
it
had
a
reasonable
basis
in
fact.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
also
say
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
charged
the
jury
on
western's
standard
of
care
and
allowed
the
jury
to
consider
its
safety
obligations
in
light
of
the
other
requirements
it
had.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
well,
it's
true,
we
are
now
proposing
to
the
court
what
we
think
would
be
a
perfect
charge
and
we
are
complaining
about
the
charge
below
on
the
ground
that
it
had
several
errors
that
we
thought--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
but
the
charge
we
proposed
was
not
given
and
the
charge
that
was
given
was
an
inaccurate
statement
of
the
law.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
it
reviewed
the
charge,
yes.
the
charge,
as
i
just
told
justice
o'connor,
failed
to
explain
to
the
jury
western's
duty,
its
standard
of
care
to
operate
with
the
highest
possible
degree
of
safety.
the
petitioner
doesn't
advocate
a
subjective
test.
petitioner
submits
that
the
employer
must
demonstrate
by
objective
evidence
at
trial
that
the
selected
job
qualifications
are
reasonable
in
light
of
the
safety
risk.
it
suggests
that
where
there
is
a
legitimate
bona
fide
dispute
among
experts
in
the
field,
not
just
a
dispute
among
witnesses
at
trial,
the
jury
should
not
decide
which
expert
view
is
correct.
if
there
is
a
dispute
among
experts
in
the
field
and
there
exists
on
both
sides
of
the
question
legitimate,
credible
evidence,
an
employer
ought
to
be
allowed
to
reach
the
most
conservative
decision.
an
employer
ought
to
be
able
to
make
safety
decisions...
ought
not
to
be
required
to
make
safety
decisions
based
on
what
he
can
prove.
he
should
be
allowed
to
take
a
more
prudent
approach.
slight
evidence
ought
to
cause
an
employer
concern
and
perhaps
cause
action
before
the
issue
is
ultimately
resolved
by
experts.
successful
risk
management
involves
the
elimination
of
potential
impediments
to
safety.
thank
you.
