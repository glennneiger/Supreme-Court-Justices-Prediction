justice
rehnquist
well,
what
precisely
did
the
company
mean
by
reversing
the
seniority
or
inverting
the
seniority?
no
one
was
contending
that
because
the
flight
engineer
had
been
around
longer
he
could
tell
the
captain
what
to
do?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
as
to
the
captains,
you
say
the
company
advances
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age,
the
fact
it
would
invert
the
seniority,
if
i
understand.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
so
bad
about
that?
justice
rehnquist
someone
who
has
previously
been
a
captain
is
more
apt
to
second-guess
or
backseat
drive?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
booth,
did
the
court
of
appeals
review
that
charge?
justice
rehnquist
in
the
abstract?
justice
rehnquist
but
supposing
they
just
don't
want
to
hire
someone
at
60
when
the
position
is
a
line
promotion
to
something
else
that
he
can
never
fill.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
i
just
want
to
know
your
answer
to
the
question
in
the
abstract.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
if
you're
running
an
airline
and
you
simply
leave
that
question
up
to
the
jury
in
every
case,
it
doesn't
help
much
in
making
decisions
as
to
what
you
can
do.
justice
rehnquist
or
if
you
leave
it
up
to
a
judge
in
every
case,
it
doesn't
help
much.
justice
rehnquist
well,
on
the
second
prong
of
that
tamiami
test
requirement
for
a
bfoq,
what
is
an
airline
supposed
to
do
if
two
medical
reports
come
to
it,
one
that
says
the
tests
to
screen
out
unqualified
people
over
50
are
valid
and
will
properly
identify
the
people
who
should
be
eliminated,
and
the
other
medical
report
says,
no,
those
tests
won't
tell
you
who's
safe
and
who
isn't
safe?
now,
is
the
employer
supposed
to
risk
public
safety
and
hire
the
person
over
60,
or
not
hire
the
people
over
60
and
be
hauled
into
court
for
the
violation
of
adea?
i
mean,
that's
a
pretty
tough
position.
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
it
be
appropriate
to
at
least
instruct
the
jury
that,
if
the
employer
has
a
rational
basis
in
fact
to
think
the
tests
won't
screen
out
individually
the
people
who
are
at
risk,
that
the
employer
is
not
liable
under
adea?
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
the
union
a
party
to
this
case?
