but
if
the
captain
flying
as
a
flight
engineer
gets
out
of
line,
he's
very
easily
dealt
with.
justice
marshall
he's
grounded,
right?
justice
marshall
the
other
airlines
have
no
trouble
with
it.
justice
marshall
well,
i
hope
you're
not
relying
on
that
only.
justice
marshall
but
mr.
booth,
it's
not
farfetched.
back
in
the
railroad
days
you
couldn't
be
an
engineer
unless
you'd
been
a
fireman,
right?
justice
marshall
i
mean,
it
was
an
absolute
rule.
justice
marshall
so
i
mean,
it's
not
too
farfetched,
from
saying
that
you
have
to
be
an
engineer...
i
mean,
that
you
have
to
be
a
flight
engineer
before
you
can
be
a
pilot.
justice
marshall
well,
they
also
had
up-or-out,
too.
