rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
your
opponents
would
argue
that
you're
the
one
that's
trying
to
narrowly
construe
it.
i
suppose
the
treaty,
like
any
other
treaty,
is
supposed
to
be
construed
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
not
either
"narrowly"
nor
"broadly".
justice
rehnquist
when
did
the
courts
of
the
united
states
first
begin
awarding
pre-judgment
interest
in
tort
cases?
