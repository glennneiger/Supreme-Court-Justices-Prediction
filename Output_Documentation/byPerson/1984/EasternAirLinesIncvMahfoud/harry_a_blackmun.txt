blackmun
well,
is
there
any
question
about
that?
justice
blackmun
suppose
we
went
to
trial
and
came
up
with
a
verdict
of
$60,000.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
about
pre-judgment
interest?
justice
blackmun
you
would
go
along
with
that?
justice
blackmun
it
isn't
pre-judgment
interest
per
se
that
you're
concerned
about?
justice
blackmun
mr.
farrell,
let
me
ask
a
foolish
question,
because
i've
missed
something
here.
in
effect,
the
government
has
conceded
liability?
justice
blackmun
why
don't
you
collect
against
the
government?
justice
blackmun
then
the
government
has
not
conceded
liability?
justice
blackmun
no,
i'm
asking
has
it?
justice
blackmun
i
guess
when
you
say
"for
all
practical
purposes"
i
fall
off
and
don't
follow.
