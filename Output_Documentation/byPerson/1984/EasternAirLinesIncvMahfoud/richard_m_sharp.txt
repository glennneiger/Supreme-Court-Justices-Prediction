mr.
richard
m.
sharp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
like
the
preceding
case,
also
is
governed
by
the
warsaw
convention
as
that
convention
is
supplemented
by
the
montreal
agreement.
now,
the
question
here
is
whether
pre-judgment
interest
may
be
awarded
in
excess
of
the
limitation
of
liability
that
is
set
forth
in
those
agreements.
in
this
case,
we
unfortunately
do
have
an
accident.
in
june
of
1975,
eastern
flight
66
crashed
short
of
the
runway
at
kennedy
international
airport
in
new
york
city.
as
a
result
of
that
crash,
approximately
91
cases
were
brought
in
the
federal
courts.
these
cases
were
consolidated
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
they
were
consolidated
for
the
purposes
of
pre-trial
discovery
and
then
a
liability
trial
was
held.
now,
among
these
91
cases
were
a
number
of
cases
involving
passengers
who
were
engaged
in
international
carriage
when
the
plane
crashed.
now,
as
to
these
passengers...
that
is,
those
passengers
who
were
engaged
in
international
carriage...
both
the
witness
and
the
montreal
agreement
apply.
under
those
agreements,
a
carrier's
liability
is
limited
to
$75,000
per
passenger.
in
these
international
cases,
eastern
moved
for
partial
summary
judgment.
the
basis
of
its
motion
was
that
partial
summary
judgment
should
be
given
in
the
form
of
an
order
that
would
limit
eastern's
liability
to
$75,000
in
the
international
passenger
cases.
in
this
particular
case,
the
case
involving
bernard
and
odile
mahfoud,
eastern's
motion
was
ultimately
granted
by
the
judge
sitting
in
the
western
district
of
louisiana.
the
judge
sustained
eastern's
position,
but
he
also
sustained
respondent
mahfoud's
position,
which
was
that,
even
though
the
limitation
of
liability
amounts
to
$75,000
pre-judgment
interest
may
be
awarded
on
top
of
that
amount.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
your
honor,
we
think
that
post-judgment
interest
is
not
presented
to
the
court.
it
is
a
different
type
of
award.
post-judgment
interest
reflects
interest
that
is
to
be
earned
on
a
debt
that
has
been
liquidated.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
that's
right.
pre-judgment
interest
is
an
element
of
the
plaintiff's
compensatory
damages.
it's
an
effort
to
bring
the
plaintiff's
damages
up
to
the
date
of
judgment.
pre-judgment
interest,
for
example,
is
often
awarded
by
juries,
if
not
by
judges
sitting
as
the
trier
of
fact.
in
this
case,
we
contend
that
the
courts
below
failed
to
give
the
full
intended
purpose
and
effect
to
the
limitation
of
liability
found
in
the
warsaw
convention
and
the
montreal
agreement.
now,
at
the
outset
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
limit
of
liability
that
must
be
applied
by
the
court
to
this
case
is
the
limitation
of
liability
that
is
contained
in
the
montreal
agreement,
but
the
montreal
agreement
must
be
interpreted
in
light
of
its
historical
context
as
a
highly
specific
amendment
to
the
warsaw
convention.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
yes,
your
honor.
on
page
3
of
our
brief
are
the
provisions
of
the
warsaw
convention.
at
page
4
is...
sorry,
3
and
4
are
the
provisions
of
the
montreal
agreement.
we
have
attached
as
an
appendix
to
this
brief
a
more
fuller
statement
of
the
montreal
agreement.
it's
sometimes
more
difficult
to
locate
in
the
library
than
the
warsaw
convention.
the
warsaw
convention
here
is
the
basic
document.
it
governs
international
air
carriage
among
120
signatory
nations.
the
montreal
agreement,
when
it's
applicable,
is
applicable
because
it
simply
makes
two
changes
in
the
warsaw
convention
system.
the
changes
are
that
the
montreal
agreement
raises
the
level
or
the
limit
of
liability;
and
the
second
change
is
that
the
montreal
agreement
waives
one
of
the
carriers'
primary
defenses.
it's
the
article
20
defense.
now,
because
the
montreal
agreement
and
the
limit
of
liability
in
that
agreement
is
an
extension
of
the
limit
of
liability
found
in
the
warsaw
convention,
it's
appropriate
to
look
first
at
the
language
of
the
warsaw
convention,
and
the
special
language
of
limitation
in
that
convention
is
found
at
page...
or
at
article
22.1,
and
that
is
at
page
3
of
our
opening
brief.
now,
article
22.1
contains
three
sentences,
and
the
first
sentence
limits
the
carrier's
liability
to
a
fixed
sum.
the
second
sentence
then
goes
on
to
create
a
narrow
exception
to
that
limit.
the
exception
is
for
those
nations
that
require
defendants
to
make
periodic
payments
to
the
plaintiff
rather
than
making
a
lump
sum
payment
to
the
plaintiff.
and
then
the
third
sentence
provides
a
means
for
raising
the
level
of
the
limit,
and
that
means
is
by
special
contract
between
the
carrier
and
the
passenger.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
your
honor,
if
the
penalty
were
in
the
form
of
a
sanction
for
a
violation
of
court
orders
or
court
rules,
we
believe
that
that
would
not
come
within
the--
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
were
delays
charged.
the
courts
in
louisiana,
particularly
the
fifth
circuit...
i'm
sorry,
the
district
court
in
louisiana...
noted
that
there
had
been
considerable
passage
of
time.
the
point
that
the
court
said
that
we
had
been
dilatory
about
was
that
we
had
raised
an
objection
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
but
our
objection
was
sustained
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
second
circuit
sitting,
to
determine
that
our
position
was
in
fact
the
correct
one.
i
think
the
fundamental
point
to
grasp
here
in
terms
of
the
delay
is
that
eastern
answered
this
complaint
approximately
six
weeks
after
it
was
filed.
at
that
time
we
said
that
the
warsaw
convention
and
the
montreal
agreement
limit
our
liability.
at
any
time
from
that
point
on,
had
the
plaintiff
chosen,
he
could
have
moved
for
a
complete
summary
judgment
asking
the
carrier
to
pay
the
sum
of
$75,000,
and
that
would
have
extinguished
the
liability
that
eastern
had
to
that
plaintiff.
that
motion
for
complete
summary
judgment
was
never
made
in
this
case.
the
warsaw
convention,
its
limitations
on
liability,
were
pressed
by
the
carrier,
not
by
the
plaintiffs.
i
wanted
to
return
now
to
the
first
sentence
in
article
21.
now,
that
sentence
states
that
in
the
transportation
of
passengers
the
liability
of
the
carrier
for
each
passenger
shall
be
limited
to
the
sum
of
125,000
francs.
now,
it's
important
to
consider
here
what
the
drafters
of
this
sentence
did.
first
of
all,
they
did
not
place
the
limit
on
a
certain
part
of
the
plaintiff's
recovery.
rather,
they
wrapped
the
limit
around
the
concept
of
the
carrier's
liability.
now,
i
want
to
reach
now
beyond
this
first
sentence
a
bit
to
discuss
this
idea
of
liability
in
terms
of
the
convention
as
a
whole.
the
concept
of
liability
that
is
referred
to
in
the
first
sentence
is
a
liability
that
is
to
be
determined
by
a
court.
it's
the
liability
of
the
carrier
at
the
time
the
plaintiff's
claim
is
reduced
to
a
liquidated
sum.
that
is
normally
when
the
plaintiff's
claim
is
reduced
to
judgment.
the
warsaw
convention
in
its
many
parts,
first
of
all
it
creates
forums
for
the
plaintiff,
jurisdiction
in
certain
national
courts.
second,
it
creates
liability
for
the
carrier.
third,
it
creates
defenses
for
the
carrier.
fourth,
it
incorporates
national
law
to
determine
the
amount
of
damages
that
may
be
due
to
the
plaintiff.
the
upshot
is
that
this
convention,
the
basic
purpose
of
the
convention,
the
basic
effect
of
the
convention,
is
to
create
liability
and
to
bring
that
liability
to
judgment.
and
it's
that
liability
that
is
covered
by
the
limit
found
in
article
22.1,
the
first
sentence.
now,
we
get
confirmation
of
that
position
from
the
second
sentence
in
article
22.1.
the
second
sentence
we
believe
again
confirms
that
the
liability
that
must
be
limited
is
the
carrier's
liability
at
the
time
of
the
judgment.
i
would
like
to
read
the
second
sentence.
its
text
is
that:
"where,
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
court
to
which
the
case
is
submitted,
damages
may
be
awarded
in
the
form
of
periodical
payments,
in
that
event,
the
equivalent
capital
value
of
said
payments
shall
not
exceed
125,000
francs.
"
--125,000
francs,
of
course,
being
the
limit
fixed
in
sentence
one.
now,
this
second
sentence
is
the
only
sentence
in
the
convention
that
speaks
to
the
time
value
of
money
and
also
of
the
limitation
on
liability.
now,
what
the
second
sentence
does
is
it
expressly
authorizes
national
courts
to
order
carriers
to
pay
out
more
than
125,000
francs
if
they
do
it
over
a
period
of
years.
but
the
sentence
makes
plain
that
the
limit...
that
is,
the
limit
contained
in
the
first
sentence...
requires
that
these
payments
not
exceed
the
capital
value
of
125,000
at
the
date
of
the
award.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
there
is
no
specification
of
the
rate.
i
take
it
at
the
date
of
judgment
one
would
use
an
annuity
table
or
the
like
to
determine
the
appropriate
rate
for
the
period.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
your
honor,
this
is
principally
a
procedure
followed
in
germany,
and
the
minutes
of
the
warsaw
convention,
the
german
delegates
submit
a
paper
that
they
would
purchase
an
annuity
or
require
the
payment
of
an
annuity
under
the
german
system.
i
gather
that
the
civil
code
today
of
germany
also
provides
that.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
yes,
yes.
i
think
in
modern
court
terminology
this
would
resemble
what
we
call
a
structured
settlement
today.
it
would
be
an
annuity
purchased
at
the
date
of
judgment
or
provided
for
by
the
defendant
at
the
date
of
judgment.
now,
i
want
to
direct
the
court's
attention
then
to
another
article
of
the
convention,
and
that
is
article
24.2.
this
article
appears
at
page
4
of
the
reply
brief,
and
in
this
article
the
drafters
of
the
convention
have
undertaken
to
remind
national
courts
that
they
may
not
apply
their
local
laws
regarding
damages
in
a
way
that
places
some
of
the
recovery
outside
of
the
limit.
article
24.2
states...
and
i'm
going
to
interpolate
here
because
the
cross-referencing
is
very
cumbersome.
but
article
24.2
states
that
in
the
cases
covered
by
article
17...
that
is,
cases
involving
death
or
bodily
injury...
any
action
for
damages,
however
founded,
can
only
be
brought
subject
to
the
conditions
and
limits
set
out
in
this
convention.
in
other
words,
this
is
the
gentle
reminder
back
to
the
national
courts.
don't
rework
your
damage
concepts,
your
damage
laws,
in
a
way
that
attempts
to
circumvent
the
limit
of
liability.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
your
honor,
i
take
it
from
the
language
of
the
text,
and
this
is
how
i
do
it.
first,
you
have
to
determine
the
law
that
is
to
be
applied,
and
it's
the
law
of
the
court
to
which
the
case
is
submitted.
you
can
have
as
many
as
four
different
international
form
in
the
montreal
system.
so
you
have
to
have
the
suit
on
file
before
you
know
which
national
law
is
going
to
apply.
but
then,
more
particularly
in
response
to
your
question,
it
refers
to
damages
being
awarded
in
the
forum
of
periodic
payments.
and
it's
the
fact
of
the
award,
the
awarding
of
damages.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
we
have
no
indication,
in
either
the
history
drawn
from
the
minutes
of
the
warsaw
convention
or
our
own
research,
that
there
is
any
computing
done
prior
to
the
date
of
judgment.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
well,
yes?
i
looked
into
the
rest
of
the
convention.
it
conceives
of
a
claim
that
is
being
brought
to
judgment.
the
idea
of
liability
itself
must
be
liquidated,
it
must
be
reduced
to
a
sum
certain.
when
you
have
a
limit
such
as
they
designed
here,
a
limit
of
125,000
francs,
the
limit
is
not
applicable...
that
is,
it's
not
able
to
be
applied...
until
you
know
the
amount
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
or
the
amount
of
the
carrier's
liability,
that
is,
since
it's
the
limit
on
liability.
and
this
convention
then
provides
the
means
for
determining
the
liability
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
so
it's
reading
a
number
of
provisions
together,
plus
the
specific
language
in
the
second
sentence
that
speaks
of
awards
or
awarding
damages,
that
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
critical
point
for
determining
the
value
of
the
limit
is
the
time
of
judgment.
now,
what
we
conclude
from
the
text
of
the
warsaw
convention
is
that
it...
first
of
all,
it
covers
all
elements.
that
is,
the
limitation
on
liability
covers
all
elephants
of
the
plaintiff's
recovery
against
the
carrier.
and
second,
as
i
mentioned
to
justice
stevens,
the
limit
fixes
the
carrier's
maximum
liability
as
of
the
date
of
the
judgment.
now,
the
lower
court
in
its
ruling
that
pre-judgment
interest
can
be
awarded
over
and
above
the
limitation
of
liability
is
inconsistent
with
this
reading
of
the
warsaw
convention
that
i
have
tried
to
give
to
the
court.
i
want
to
turn
now
to
the
text
of
the
montreal
agreement.
we
think
the
text
the
montreal
agreement
confirms
the
fact
that
pre-judgment
interest
cannot
be
awarded
over
and
above
the
limit
of
liability.
the
relevant
provision
in
the
montreal
agreement
appears
at
page
4
of
our
brief,
and
that
provision
states
in
part
that
the
limit
of
liability
for
each
carrier
for
death,
wounding,
or
other
bodily
injury
shall
be
the
sum
of
$75,000
inclusive
of
legal
fees
and
costs.
now,
once
again,
the
limit
is
wrapped
around
the
concept
of
liability,
the
concept
of
the
carrier's
liability.
and
again,
it's
liability
as
determined
after
litigation.
there
is
this
reference
to
fees
and
legal
costs.
the
limit
is
not
by
its
terms
restricted
to
certain
items
in
a
plaintiff's
recovery.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
with
respect
to
the
text
of
the
montreal
agreement
is
by
way
of
rebuttal
to
my
opponent,
and
that
is
that
montreal's...
warsaw's
limit...
the
limit
contained
in
the
montreal
agreement,
rather,
is,
like
the
limit
contained
in
the
warsaw
convention,
simply
a
limit.
it's
a
ceiling.
it
is
not
a
guarantee
of
recovery
in
the
amount
of
$75,000.
now,
the
way
to
prove
this
point
textually,
i
think,
is
by
looking
at
the
model
notice
that
is
contained
in
the
montreal
agreement,
and
that
is
at
page
a-3.
it's
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
there
the
drafters
of
the
montreal
agreement
set
down
the
notice
that
carriers
will
give
to
passengers,
that
is,
the
notice
of
limitation
of
liability.
and
that
notice
is
to
provide
that
the
liability
of
the
carrier
"is
limited
in
most
cases
to
proven
damages,
not
to
exceed
$75,000.
"
the
notice
makes
clear
that
the
plaintiff
must
prove
their
damages.
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
must
prove
their
damages
shows
that
the
montreal
limit
is
a
ceiling
on
liability
as
of
the
date
of
judgment.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
my
opponent
argues
that
what
the
montreal
agreement
has
done
is
effectively
created
a
liquidation
of
damages
provision,
and
it's
liquidated
damages
in
the
amount
of
$75,000
that
are
due
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
i
think
there's
a
practical
answer
to
that.
i've
tried
now
to
give
you
the
textual
reading
as
to
why
that
is
not
so.
the
practical
answer
to
that
is
that
nobody
would
have
agreed
to
that
provision
because
this
limit,
the
$75,000
limit,
not
only
reaches
liability
for
wrongful
death,
but
it
reaches
liability
for
personal
injury
and
other
bodily
damage.
the
examples
that
the
court
was
working
with
in
the
preceding
argument
of
minor,
important
injuries
but
minor
injuries
to
a
human
being,
would
be
recompensed
at
$75,000
per
injury
if
one
were
to
conclude
that
the
limit
in
effect
develops
a
liquidated
damage
for
injuries
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
no,
your
honor.
you
could
recover
pre-judgment
interest.
you
could
recover
$15,000
worth
of
pre-judgment
interest.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
that's
right.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
no,
no,
it's
not.
it's
anything.
this
could
be...
this
could
be
pain
and
suffering.
it
could
be
any
item
of
the
plaintiff's
injury.
it
could
be
lost
future
earnings.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
that's
right,
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
this
case
it's
awarded
by
louisiana
statute.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
yes,
your
honor.
the
fact
is--
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
--right.
we
deposited
the
full
amount
four
months
prior
to
the
rendering
of
the
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
i
believe
the
complaint
was
filed
in
december
of
1975.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
well,
your
honor,
my
own
position
is
that
pre-judgment
interest
is
not
really
likely
to
be
much
of
an
inducement
to
settlement
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant.
there
is
a
case
cited,
the
bond
case
from
west
virginia
that
is
cited
in
our
brief,
where
the
court
faces
up
to,
how
useful
is
pre-judgment
interest
as
a
real
means
for
inducing
settlement,
and
concludes
that
where
the
defendant
has
a
substantial
defense
and
the
plaintiff
has
a
substantial
claim,
it's
likely
they
would
take
account
of
pre-judgment
interest
in
settling
the
case,
in
valuing
the
case,
but
it's
not
likely
that
one
or
the
other
would
take
down
the
flag
because
pre-judgment
interest
was
available.
i
think
that
is
probably
in
my
judgment
the
most
realistic
analysis
of
pre-judgment
interest.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
yes,
it
is
a
very
significant
percentage
of
the
recovery
against
eastern.
it's
only
a
pittance
of
the
recovery
against
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
that's
right.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
it
was
just
several
days
after
the
district
court
granted
our
motion
limiting
our
liability
to
$75,000.
i
would
say
to
you
that
our
motion
was
opposed,
and
that
one
of
the
grounds
that
the
motion
was
opposed
on
was
that
the
limit
was
unenforceable
in
light
of
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
twa.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
that's
right,
that's
right.
i
want
to
rebut
that
point,
your
honor,
with
the
fact
that
at
any
time,
if
the
plaintiff
had
chosen
to
move
for
complete
summary
judgment,
i
think
it's
likely
that
he
would
have
prevailed
on
this
record,
and
he
never
did.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
by
the
court,
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
i
wanted
to
try
briefly
to
clarify
some
of
the
facts
relating
to
how
this
litigation
was
handled.
there
were
92
cases
at
the
high
water
mark
in
the
litigation.
when
the
case
was
fixed
for
liability
trial
on
september
the
18th,
that
number
had
been
reduced
to
54.
on
september
the
18th,
1978,
18
of
the
54
cases
were
international
cases
of
the
warsaw-montreal
variety.
36
were
domestic
cases
that
were
going
to
be
tried
on
the
ordinary
issues
of
damages
and
negligence
outside
the
warsaw
convention.
the
trial
counsel
for
eastern
was
prepared
for
a
six
weeks
liability
trial
on
issues
of
whether
the
air
traffic
controllers
and
the
like
had
caused
the
crash,
when
the
plaintiffs
on
the
day
of
trial...
that
is,
the
warsaw
plaintiffs...
and
in
some
cases
on
the
preceding
day
to
trial
orally
moved
for
summary
judgment,
for
partial
summary
judgment
in
the
sum...
i'm
sorry.
they
did
not
ask
for
$75,000.
they
just
asked
orally
that
eastern
be
declared
liable
to
them.
eastern
did
not
say
it
was
not
liable
for
the
accident
under
warsaw,
but
it
said
that
it
was
not
liable
to
them,
to
the
plaintiffs;
that
there
was
an
individual...
there
was
a
dispute
of
fact
over
who
should
be
the
plaintiff.
the
reason
for
that
was
that
in
almost
half
of
the
international
cases
there
were
more
than
two
human
beings
that
were
contesting
for
the
position
of
representing
the
estate
or
of
bringing
the
wrongful
death
claim
against
the
estate.
eastern
was
reserving
its
position
so
that
it
would
be
liable
to
the
proper
plaintiff
and
not
also
be
liable
to
the
improper
plaintiff.
in
the
mahfoud
case
there
was
not
a
contest,
but
the
papers
did
not
show
that.
counsel
is
faced
with
15
different
oral
motions
for
summary
judgment.
he
takes
the
position,
i
would
like
to
have
that
in
writing,
as
rule
56
entitles
me
to
have
it
in
writing.
i
would
like
to
have
ten
days
notice.
in
ten
days
he
can
pull
together
the
facts
and
determine
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
dispute
with
mahfoud.
that
was
never
done.
now,
the
issue
of
summary
judgment
was
revisited.
it
was
revisited
approximately
a
year
later
in
proceedings
to
amend
the
summary
judgment,
and
at
that
point...
at
that
point
the
plaintiffs
moved
to
amend
the
summary
judgment.
eastern
urged
the
trial
judge
to
decide
the
issue
of
capacity
now.
the
trial
judge
did
not
do
that.
the
plaintiff's
counsel
for
mahfoud
at
page
41
proffered
an
affidavit...
this
is
41
of
the
joint
appendix...
proffered
an
affidavit,
and
in
the
affidavit
they
suggested
that
any
summary
judgment
against
eastern
make
clear
that
eastern
is
not
precluded
by
the
judgment
from
raising
its
defense
of
lack
of
capacity.
in
other
words,
we're
trying
to
get
the
legal
issues
solved
and
they
are
making
clear
that
the
legal
issues
are
reserved
for
another
day.
now,
i
disagree
with
mr.
farrell
on
the
point
concerning
whether
mahfoud
ever
contested
the
application
of
the
limit.
there
is
a
four-page
brief
in
the
record
at
pages
902
to
906...
it's
in
the
unprinted
portion
of
the
record
before
the
court...
in
which
mahfoud
urges
the
district
court
to
declared
that
the
limit
is
unenforceable.
i
want
to
make
two
other
points,
and
that
is
that
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
quite
properly
mentioned,
after
the
warsaw
convention
it
became
evident,
at
least
to
some
of
the
drafters
at
hague
and
montreal,
it
became
evident
that
some
courts
were
applying
legal
fees
and
costs
above
the
limit,
and
in
that
event--
mr.
richard
m.
sharp
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
