mr.
sharp,
would
you
help
me
by
telling
me
where
in
the
papers
the
language
you
rely
on
is
found?
justice
stevens
mr.
sharp,
may
i
just
ask
on
the
periodic
payments
sentence.
you
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
amount
shall
not
exceed
the
125,000
francs
as
of
the
date
of
judgment.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
say
date
of
judgment
here.
are
there
cases
that
refer
to
that
date?
justice
stevens
but
if
the
law
in
this
certain
place
were
settled
the
damage
issue
should
always
be
computed
as
of
the
date
of
injury...
i'm
not
suggesting
that's
the
law
in
any
state...
then
one
could
read
it
differently.
i
kind
of
thing
that's
the
issue
in
the
case,
whether
or
not
it's
correct
to
insert
the
words
"from
the
date
of
judgment".
justice
stevens
but
is
there
any
indication
that
that
is
the
date
from
which
computing
should
be
done?
justice
stevens
in
this
case
it's
a
very
significant
percentage
of
the
recovery,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
we're
talking
about
the
$75,000
recovery.
justice
stevens
and
it
was
several
years
after
the
complaint
was
filed
that
you
made
the
deposit?
justice
stevens
but
it
is
true
that
the
deposit
was
made
several
years
after
the
claim
was
filed?
justice
stevens
your
opponent
says
that
you
could
have
had
a
summary
judgment
much
earlier
if
you
just
asked
for
it.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
another
bad
question--
--don't
you
still
have
a
claim
against
the
government?
justice
stevens
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
i
notice
you
said
that
eastern
knew
that
there
was
no
issue
about
capacity,
and
i'm
puzzled
that
eastern
would
know
it
when
the
judge
didn't
know
it.
but
that's
not
really
the
question
i
had,
and
that
is,
you
talked
about
eastern's
negligence.
is
that
because
a
large
number
of
the
passengers
were
just
domestic
passengers
and
they
were
relevant
to
that?
because
negligence
i
wouldn't
understand
would
be
relevant
to
your
case.
justice
stevens
and
their
negligence
really
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
your
client's
claim,
who
was
an
international
passenger?
justice
stevens
not
the
government,
the
court--
