justice
marshall
but
suppose,
mr.
sharp,
the
defendant
used
excessive
delaying
tactics
before
and
during
the
trial
and
the
judge
decided
to
penalize
him
$5,000?
justice
marshall
well,
weren't
there
some
delays
charged
in
this?
justice
marshall
at
what
rates?
justice
marshall
put
you
didn't
file
in
new
orleans...
i
mean,
in
louisiana?
justice
marshall
did
you
make
any
summary
motions
there?
justice
marshall
well,
we
realize
that
louisiana
law
is
civil
law,
don't
we?
justice
marshall
so
it's
impossible
to
get
any...
the
49
states
to
adopt
civil
law,
so
this
is
going
to
be
different
from
the
other
states.
justice
marshall
that
it's
not
damages?
justice
marshall
that
pre-trial
interest
is
not
damages?
justice
marshall
mr.
farrell,
suppose
the
state
of
louisiana
passed
a
law
and
said
that
in
all
wrongful
death
statutes,
if
they
involve
the
warsaw
pact
they
shall
include
judgment
on
interest,
pre-judgment
interest.
would
that
be
good?
justice
marshall
well,
if
they
say
that
in
all
cases
under
the
warsaw
pact
the
state
may,
at
its
will,
add
$15,000
to
the
$75,000?
justice
marshall
well,
put
down
the
same
amount
of
money;
would
that
be
a
different
problem?
justice
marshall
but
it
adds
money.
justice
marshall
more
money.
