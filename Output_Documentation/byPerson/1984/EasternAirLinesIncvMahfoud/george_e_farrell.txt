mr.
george
e.
farrell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
provisions
of
the
warsaw
convention,
as
well
as
the
intent
of
the
signatories
to
it
and
to
the
montreal
agreement,
clearly
show
that
there
never
was
a
prohibition
to
exceeding
the
limits
of
liability,
for
the
payment
of
interest
or
otherwise.
as
pointed
out
a
moment
ago--
mr.
george
e.
farrell
--the
"otherwise"
would
be
the
payment
of
attorneys'
fees
and
expenses
in
addition
to
the
warsaw
limit,
the
initial
warsaw
limit,
your
honor.
as
pointed
out,
the
first
paragraph
of
article
22
does
establish
a
liability
limit
of
$8300.
that
second
sentence
of
that
same
paragraph,
however,
which
refers
to
periodical
payments,
does
provide
for
interest.
as
petitioner
admits
in
his
brief
at
page
14
and
his
reply
brief
at
page
6,
these
words
mean
that
the
award
for
proven
damages
cannot
exceed
the
warsaw
limit,
but
if
the
damages
are
paid
over
a
period
after
they
accrue
an
additional
sum
may
be
paid
to
the
claimant,
which
the
petitioner
says
is
time
value
of
money,
the
basis
for
interest.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
right.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
the
consequence
is,
your
honor,
that
no
matter
what
you
call
it,
interest
is
interest.
and
that
rule
provided
for
pre-judgment
interest,
or
that
provision.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
it
would
be,
your
honor--
mr.
george
e.
farrell
--i'm
not
sure
that
was
the
german
arrangement.
but
as
we
allege,
your
honor,
and
as
we
urge
the
court
to
rule,
the
damages
accrue
at
the
time
of
death
in
a
death
case,
and
if
you
don't
pay
them
for
seven
years,
as
was
this
instance,
in
this
case,
you
pay
interest.
interest
is
for
the
use
of
money.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
it
is,
your
honor.
now,
the
signatories
of
warsaw
and
montreal
never
considered
that
the
liability
limitation
was
absolute.
the
warsaw
limitation
was
never
strictly
applied
by
the
signatories
other
than
the
united
states.
both
drion
in
his
treatise
on
"limitation
on
liabilities
in
international
air
law.
"
at
page
114
and
lowenfeld
in
80
harvard
law
review
at
508
point
out
that
the
constant
practice
of
the
courts
when
applying
the
limitation
provision
of
warsaw
was
to
exceed
the
limitation
by
awarding
attorneys'
fees
and
legal
expenses
against
the
airline.
in
addition,
at
least
belgium
and
france
awarded
interest
on
top
of
the
warsaw
limit.
no
one
outside
the
united
states
had
previously
thought
that
the
warsaw
convention
limitation
could
not
be
exceeded
by
the
application
of
domestic
law.
now,
this
procedure
had
been
going
on
for
25
years
before
the
united
states
became
aware
of
it
at
the
hague
conference
in
1955.
when
the
delegates
did
become
aware
of
it,
by
their
own
volition
they
changed
or
had
it
changed
so
that
the
hague
protocol
permitted
the
payment
of
attorneys'
fees
and
expenses
on
top
of
the
limit.
now,
this
was
done
by
the
insistence
of
the
united
states
that
maximum
recoveries
were
desired
and
that
the
expenses
of
litigation
oftentimes
ate
up
the
amount
of
the
award.
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
if
the
issue
of
interest
because
of
delay
had
been
considered,
that
it
would
have
been
approved
also.
in
other
words,
the
delegates
neglected
to
deal
with
the
problem;
they
would
wish
to
have
it
relieved...
resolved,
rather...
if
they
had
been
aware
of
it.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
no,
i
think
that
we
don't
have
to
do
that,
your
honor.
we
are
permitted
by
the
articles
of
the
warsaw
convention
to
use
domestic
law,
and
our
domestic
law
provides
for
interest
on
a
damages
award.
we're
not
trying
to
change
the
warsaw
convention
in
any
way.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
well,
that
is
his
position.
it's
not
very
consistent,
however.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
under
the
law
of
the
united
states,
justice
o'connor,
and
particularly
under
the
law
of
the
court
where
this
case
was
tried,
in
louisiana,
pre-judgment
interest
is
not
a
part
of
damages.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
we
look
to
the
law
of
the
court.
under
the
articles--
mr.
george
e.
farrell
--the
law
of
the
court
which
has
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
if
it
is
a
case,
in
this
case
in
louisiana
in
a
federal
court,
you
would
look
to
the
federal
court
to
apply
louisiana
law.
and
louisiana
law
in
this
instance
provided
for
pre-judgment
interest.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
liability
would
accrue
at
the
time
of
the
death
in
this
case,
and
that's
pursuant
to
the
law
of
the
united
states
and
all
jurisdictions
that
i
know
of.
at
that
time
damages
would
be
established.
if
the
case
were
worth
x
number
of
dollars,
then
no
matter
whether
it
took
ten
years
to
resolve
it,
it
was
still
worth
x
number
of
dollars
at
the
time
of
death.
the
delay
in
between
is
the
period
that
we're
actually
talking
about
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
you
can
delay
a
case
for
seven
years
and
still
not
pay
anything
in
addition
to
the
actual
damages
which
accrued
at
the
time
of
death.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
george
e.
farrell
well,
i
think
maybe
he
forgot
that
we
did
move
for
summary
judgment,
and
eastern
opposed
it.
now,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
made
when
the
cases
were
in
new
york.
this
was
a
multi-district
litigation
case
and
it
was
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
both
the
government
and
the
united
states...
the
government
here,
the
united
states,
and
eastern
air
lines
were
defendants.
just
before
trial
was
to
commence
on
liability
the
united
states,
pursuant
to
an
agreement
which
it
had
made
with
eastern
air
liner,
decided
not
to
contest
liability.
now,
the
agreement
was
that
eastern
would
pay
60
percent
of
all
the
losses
and
the
government
would
pay
40
percent.
but
for
that
agreement,
eastern
would
get
entire
control
over
all
aspects
of
the
litigation,
including
settlements,
trials,
damages
trials,
whatever.
when
the
government
decided
not
to
contest
liability,
there
obviously
now
was
a
solvent
party.
there
was
no
reason
to
continue
with
eastern,
and
the
plaintiff
in
the
case,
respondent
here,
moved
for
summary
judgment.
eastern
opposed
it,
saying
that,
on
a
technical
ground,
saying
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
have
capacity
to
sue.
there
were
several...
two
more
appeals
on
this,
and
two
years
later...
two
years,
in
fact,
after
a
judgment
was
rendered
by
the
jury
finding
eastern
both
negligent
and
liable...
the
second
circuit
agreed
that
there
was
a
technical
deficiency
and
sent
the
case
back,
said
that
you
must
give
then
notice
so
that
they
can
decide
whether
or
not
they
want
to
put
in
written
papers
and
so
forth.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
later
on,
justice
marshall,
the
case
was
remanded
to
louisiana
for
trial
on
damages.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
no,
your
honor,
because
the
damages
trial
then
was
imminent.
after
eastern
had
been
found
negligent
by
jury
trial
and
the
united
states
was
in
the
case,
there
was
no
reason.
we
still
did
not
have
the
decision
on
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
had
capacity.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
law
of
louisiana
in
regard
to,
in
this
case,
damages
is
very
similar
to
every
other
jurisdiction.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
e.
farrell
pre-trial
interest
in
louisiana
is
not
damages,
that's
correct.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
correct.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
the
problem
was
that
we
could
not
do
it
because
the
district
court
in
new
york
had,
in
one
of
its
decisions,
had
stated
that
it
was
not
going
to
decide
capacity
to
sue
and
was
going
to
remand
the
louisiana
cases
back
to
louisiana
and
let
the
louisiana
court
make
that
decision.
when
eastern
appealed
the
case...
knowing
very
well,
incidentally,
that
the
plaintiff
did
have
capacity
to
sue
either
in
louisiana
or
in
new
york...
the
case
then
was
in
the
hands
of
the
second
circuit
and
didn't
come
back
for
two
years.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
we
had
the
claim,
your
honor,
but
we
had
no...
we
could
not
go
to
trial
because
the
capacity
to
sue
issue
was
never
decided,
and
the
case
was
in
the
hands
of
the
second
circuit,
which
didn't
decide
it
for
two
years.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
if
the
government
had
not
conceded?
mr.
george
e.
farrell
the
government
did
concede...
well,
it
didn't
concede
liability.
it
agreed
not
to
contest
liability;
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
same
thing.
eventually
damages
were
tried
against
the
united
states.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
i
meant
that
a
concession
of
liability
and
an
agreement
not
to
contest
it
as
far
as
the
plaintiff
is
concerned
is
not
a
lot
different,
although
it
has
some
different
aspects,
we
agree.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
the
majority
of
the
passengers
here
were
domestic
passengers,
although
there
were
quite
a
few
warsaw
passengers
involved.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
well,
at
that
time,
since
the
motion
for
summary
judgment...
the
district
court
found
that
our
motion
was
proper,
so
we
had...
we
were
not
in
the
trial
on
damages
against
eastern...
or
on
liability
against
eastern.
our
case
was
out
of
it
because
we
had...
under
warsaw,
montreal,
the
district
court
gave
us
judgment.
you
were
asking
how
eastern
knew
about
the
capacity
and
the
government
did
not.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
or
the
court,
i'm
sorry,
the
court.
eastern
had
in
its
hands
for
two
years
prior
to
this
motion
certified
copies
of
tutorship,
which
is
the
procedure
in
louisiana,
and
letters
of
administration,
which
are
the
procedure
in
new
york.
and
in
addition,
just
two
or
three
days
before
the
plaintiff's
motion
in
the
case,
before
respondent's
motion,
eastern
had
served
upon
him
an
offer
of
settlement,
and
it
was
served
three
days
before.
and
in
the
offer
of
settlement,
eastern
had
to
know
that
he
had...
or
it's
an
admission,
an
admission
that
he
was...
or
did
have
capacity
to
sue.
so
eastern
knew
it
very
well.
it
had
never
come
before
the
court
because
the
court
had
never
wanted
to
decide
that
issue.
it
was
going
to
send
it
back
to
louisiana.
now,
the
petitioner
states
that
he
agrees
that
you
can
have
pre-judgment
interest,
just
so
it
doesn't
exceed
the
limitation.
i'd
like
to
just
give
you
an
example
of
what
the
result
would
be
if
this
were
correct.
if
you
had,
for
instance,
a
$25,000
judgment
or
if
the
damages
were
worth
$25,000,
and
the
airline
didn't
pay
at
for
say
a
year
and
the
interest
rate
was
ten
percent,
he
would
permit
the
$2500
of
pre-judgment
interest
to
be
added
onto
the
amount
that
the
airline
owed
the
claimant.
now,
if
it
were
say
$74,000
and
the
judgment
was
not
paid
until
the
year
after
and
the
interest
was
the
same
ten
percent,
the
petitioner
would
permit
payment
of
interest
in
the
amount
of
$1,000,
but
no
more.
the
remaining
$6,400
earned
on
a
$74,000
damages
award
would
remain
in
the
pocket
of
the
insurance
company.
now,
in
the
subject
case,
where
the
judgment
was
for
$75,000
for
decedent
and
the
airline
kept
the
money
made
on
the
investment
of
that
amount
for
its
own
use
for
over
seven
years,
the
petitioner's
position
would
not
permit
any
interest,
even
though
the
damages
award,
because
of
the
delay,
was
only
worth
about
$31,000,
permitting
the
airline's
insurers
to
pocket
approximately
$44,000
per
decedent
for
its
own
account
or,
under
its
own
figures,
a
total
of
$87,000.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
trying
to
change
the
treaty.
we're
merely
saying
that
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
permit
domestic
law
to
be
applied,
but
the
treaty
could
not
operate
without
domestic
law.
it
really
provides
guidelines
and,
as
this
court
held
in
the
franklin
mint
case,
it's
a
flexible
treaty.
it
wasn't
meant
to
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
your
honor,
pre-judgment
interest
was
never
mentioned
in
the
treaty,
so
we
have
to
look
to
the
background
to
see
if
we
can
interpret
it
properly.
as
i
tried
to
point
out
in
the
beginning,
the
signatories
never
thought
that
exceeding
the
limitation
of
warsaw
was
any
problem.
they
all
did
it.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
yes,
your
honor.
well,
expenses
is
what
they
said.
i'm
not
sure
what
"expenses"
were.
but
the
principle
is
the
same.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
it's
been
for
a
long
time,
and
even
today
some
courts
do
not.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
well,
your
honor,
in
a
case
like
this,
in
a
death
case,
as
i'm
pointing
out,
the
damages
accrue
at
the
time
of
death.
so
if
you
don't
pay
it,
it's
not
in
the
jury's
hands.
it's
a
ministerial
procedure
that
the
clerk
of
the
court
says
you
have
to
pay
so
much
interest
on
it
until
you
pay
it.
it
doesn't
change
the
treaty,
it
doesn't
change
the
law
of
damages.
it
just
is
a
fairness,
a
way
of
proceeding.
now,
the
signatory
united
states
never
considered
pre-judgment
interest
as
an
integral
part
of
proven
a
damages,
as
petitioner
would
have
the
court
believe.
the
united
states
chairman--
mr.
george
e.
farrell
--i
would
think
so.
under
the
local
law,
it
shouldn't
be
any
problem.
that
wouldn't
affect
the
treaty
any.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
well,
i
think
now
you're
getting
into
a
different
problem.
you're
changing
now
the
limitation.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
if
you
change...
you
cannot
change
the
limitation,
justice
marshall,
because
only
the
congress
can
do
that,
or
perhaps
this
court.
but
awarding
interest
on
a
judgment
does
not
change
anything
in
warsaw
or
does
not
change
anything
in
montreal.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
no,
it
doesn't
add
money.
it
merely
makes
the
award--
mr.
george
e.
farrell
--yes,
it...
it
makes
it
adequate.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
well,
as
i
was
going
to
point
out,
your
honor,
the
united
states'
position
at
montreal,
as
stated
by
chairman
lowenfeld,
was
that
recovery
for
death
or
injury
would
presumably
be
based
on
some
combination
of
earning
power,
life
expectancy,
and,
in
the
case
of
death,
degree
of
dependence
of
the
survivors.
he
didn't
say
anything
about
interest,
interest
being
a
part
of
damages.
there's
no
express
language
in
warsaw
or
montreal
either
permitting
pre-judgment
interest
or
excluding
it.
miller
in
her
treatise
on
19,
gives
some
insight.
she
states
that:
"where
the
convention
is
silent,
the
lex
for
a
will
determine
the
conditions
under
which
the
damages
allegedly
due
may
be
compensated.
"
mr.
george
e.
farrell
i
meant,
your
honor,
that
it's
silent
as
to
interest.
we're
not
saying
that
you
exceed
the
limitation.
the
limitation
was
the
damages
which
were
awarded
for
the
death,
the
damages
which
accrued
at
the
time
of
death.
the
interest
merely
is
for
reimbursement
for
the
use
of
that
money
by
the
insurance
company
when
it
didn't
pay
for
seven
years.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
if
it
was
in
a
jurisdiction
that
permitted
pre-judgment
interest,
it
always
would
be
added.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
no,
the
limit
of
the
policy
would
stay
the
same.
but
the
fact
that
they
didn't
pay
it
on
time
would...
the
interest
would
be
awarded
on
top
of
it.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
well,
it
would--
mr.
george
e.
farrell
--the
insurer
would
only
be
liable
for
damages
up
to
the
extent
of
the
policy.
again,
but
if
he
didn't
pay
it,
if
it's
a
death
case,
he
was
liable
at
the
time
of
death
for
$75,000.
mr.
george
e.
farrell
well,
he
didn't
get
the
judgment
until
seven
years
after
the
accident,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
the
amount
accrues
at
the
time
of
the
death,
and
if
you
pay
it
seven
years
later
you
pay
interest
on
it.
if
it
were
only
an
injury
amounting
to
$5,000
and
you
didn't
pay
it
for
seven
years,
you
would
pay
interest
on
the
seven
years,
over
that
period
of
time.
i
might
say
that
the
respondent
here
never
did
oppose
the
warsaw
limit,
as
intimated
by
petitioner.
franklin
mint
was
mentioned
to
the
district
court
after
it
was
handed
down
in
a
slip
opinion,
to
show
that
this
was
an
other
case.
franklin
mint
could
never
have
been
used
in
this
case
by
the
court.
it
was
prospective.
it
had
no
bearing
whatsoever
here.
and
i
might
say
that,
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
eastern
air
line
depended
upon
the
domangue
case,
which
is
the
basis
for
this
decision
in
the
mahfoud
case.
i
might
conclude
by
saying
that
denying
pre-judgment
interest
in
this
case
would
fail
to
effect
any
purpose
of
the
convention's
framers
or
signatories.
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
ensures
that
a
warsaw-montreal
recovery
is
not
diminished
by
the
simple
strategy
of
delaying
payment
until
the
award
diminishes
in
value.
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
