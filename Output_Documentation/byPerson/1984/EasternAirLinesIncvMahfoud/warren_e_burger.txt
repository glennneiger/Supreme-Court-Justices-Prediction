mr.
sharp,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
what
would
you
say
about
post-judgment
interest?
chief
justice
burger
post-judgment
interest
is
simply
interest
on
a
debt,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
is
that
what
has
been
done?
chief
justice
burger
i
thought
you
meant
on
the
date
of
closing
they
would
buy
an
annuity,
whatever
annuity
could
be
provided
for
$75,000.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
farrell.
chief
justice
burger
just
what
do
you
incorporate
in
the
"or
otherwise"?
chief
justice
burger
that's
the
annuity
arrangement
that
you're
speaking
of,
that
we
were
speaking
of
before.
chief
justice
burger
but
on
the
ordinary
rules
of
construction,
since
they
expressly
talk
about
interest
there
but
omit
it
in
the
previous
discussion,
what's
the
consequence
of
that
rule
of
construction?
chief
justice
burger
if
they're
paid
over
a
period
of
installments.
chief
justice
burger
as
under
the
german
arrangement.
chief
justice
burger
well,
that's
the
issue
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting
we
should
go
ahead
and
finish
their
task
for
them?
chief
justice
burger
--well,
that
analysis
would
support
an
argument
that
this
was
not
a
very
good
treaty.
chief
justice
burger
when
it's
a
jury
verdict
you
can't
really
find
it
out,
can
you,
if
the
jury
takes
it
into
account?
chief
justice
burger
but
there's
no
silence,
here.
there's
a
very
fixed
$75,000
statement.
chief
justice
burger
if
you
had
an
ordinary
domestic
negligence
case
where
the
defendant
was
insured
by
public
liability
insurance
in
the
usual
way,
but
the
limit
of
the
policy
was
$75,000...
now,
it
is
often
suggested,
whether
true
or
not,
that
insurance
companies
who
take
over
the
defense
of
these
cases
delay
as
long
as
possible
so
they
can
keep
getting
the
interest
on
their
own
money
in
their
own
bank
or
portfolio.
do
you
think
any
pre-judgment
interest
would
be
added
to
the
$75,000
limit
on
liability
of
the
insurer?
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
the
limit
of
the
policy
would
go
up?
chief
justice
burger
now
you're
talking
about
post-judgment
interest.
chief
justice
burger
could
the
insurer,
the
insurer,
be
liable
for
any
more
than
$75,000
on
any
theory
at
all?
chief
justice
burger
well,
your
opponent
has
conceded,
understand
it,
that
if
they
didn't
pay
the
judgment
as
i
they
would
be
liable
for
interest
on
the
judgment.
i'm
sure
he--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
sharp?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
