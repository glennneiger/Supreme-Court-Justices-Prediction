justice
o'connor
is
that
because
pre-judgment
interest
is
really
part
of
compensatory
damages?
justice
o'connor
how
long
has
this
case
been
in
litigation?
something
like
ten
years?
justice
o'connor
the
rule
you
want
us
to
adopt
certainly
wouldn't
encourage
early
settlement
of
airline
accident
claims,
would
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
understood
your
opponent
as
agreeing
that
pre-judgment
interest
is
awardable
up
to
the
overall
limit
on
damages
provided
for
under
the
montreal
agreement.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
that
depends
in
part
on
whether
you
think
pre-judgment
interest
is
part
of
damages
for
compensation.
justice
o'connor
what
law
do
you
think
we
look
to
for
determining
pre-judgment
interest,
the
state
law,
or
is
that
a
matter
of
federal
law,
or
what
is
it?
justice
o'connor
the
law
of
the
court?
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
mean,
state
law
if
it's
a
state
case?
justice
o'connor
how
would
that
result
in
uniformity
of
liability,
which
was
a
primary
goal
of
the
warsaw
convention
and
the
montreal
agreement?
justice
o'connor
for
attorneys'
fees
and
costs.
justice
o'connor
but
this
isn't
the
wording,
interest
on
a
judgment.
we're
talking
about
pre-judgment
interest.
so
doesn't
it
really
turn
on
how
we
characterize
it,
whether
it's
a
part
of
compensation
to
the
victim
or
not?
