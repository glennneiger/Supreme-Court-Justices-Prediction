mr.
edward
a.
miller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
two
important
issues
concerning
the
relationship
between
copyright
and
first
amendment
interests.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
yes.
first,
does
the
first
amendment
require
that
the
scope
of
protection
for
a
copyrighted
work
of
non-fiction
dealing
with
news
and
history
be
narrowed?
secondly,
does
the
policy
in
the
fair
use
case,
does
the
policy
of
facilitating
the
harvest
of
knowledge
call
for
a
sanction
for
the
use
of
an
unpublished
manuscript
that
the
author
himself
is
about
to
publish?
the
case
also
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
court
below
heard,
first
of
all,
in
failing
to
consider
that
the
manuscript
was
unpublished;
and
secondly,
in
failing
to
consider
that
the
user
added
nothing
at
all
to
the
material
that
he
published.
in
february
of
1977,
shortly
after
leaving
office,
president
ford
signed
a
publishing
agreement
with
harper
&
row
and
the
reader's
digest
to
publish
his
memoirs.
president
ford
retained
an
experienced
writer,
trevor
armbrister,
to
assist
him
in
that
task,
and
the
work
began
almost
at
once
on
a
project
that
was
to
take
two
years,
that
is,
the
writing
of
the
book.
the
district
court
has
detailed
findings
of
the
extensive
work
that
went
into
that,
and
i'll
just
mention
one
or
two
of
those
facts.
trevor
armbrister
met
with
president
ford
on
200
separate
occasions
for
interviews,
and
each
of
those
interviews
lasted
two
hours
each.
those
interviews
were
taped
and
they
were
typed
up,
and
they
resulted
in
3600
legal
sized
transcripts
pages
of
those
interviews.
trevor
armbrister
took
that
material--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
don't
know
how
many
there
were.
trevor
armbrister
took
that
material
and
he
took
material
of
almost
equal
mass
from
his
interviews
with
others,
together
with
a
mountain
of
material
from
public
records
and
the
like,
and
then
out
of
that
he
prepared
a
manuscript
for
president
ford.
president
ford
reviewed
that
manuscript
word
for
word,
and
he
then
reviewed
three
subsequent
revisions
word
for
word
before
finally
giving
his
okay
for
the
manuscript
to
be
published.
in
march,
1979,
approximately
two
years
later,
harper
&
row's
subsidiary
right
department
began
to
contact
newspapers
and
magazines
to
ascertain
if
any
of
them
were
interested
in
publishing
excerpts
from
this
book
prior
to
book
publication,
a
right
that
is
referred
to
in
the
book
publishing
trade
as
"first
serial
rights".
in
circulating
that
manuscript,
the
subsidiary
rights
department
secured
a
confidentiality
agreement
from
each
of
the
firms
to
whom
it
was
given.
eventually
an
agreement
was
signed
with
time
magazine
whereby
time
agreed
to
publish
excerpts
from
chapters
1
and
3
of
the
book,
a
7500-word
excerpt
which
was
to
appear
in
the
time
magazine
issue
that
was
to
go
on
sale
on
april
16th,
1979.
that
agreement
was
entered
into
in
the
middle
of
march,
1979.
the
agreement
also
provided
that
if
for
any
reason
material
from
chapters
1
and
3
of
the
manuscript
were
published
prior
to
time's
publication,
time
would
have
the
right
to
renegotiate
the
second
installment
of
the
advance,
which
was
$12,500.
approximately
two
weeks
later,
a
copy
of
the
manuscript
found
its
way
into
the
hands
of
the
editor
of
the
nation
magazine.
the
editor
testified
that
he
did
not
solicit
it
and
did
not
pay
for
it.
he
has
never
revealed
who
the
source
was,
but
he
has
acknowledged
that
he
knew
that
the
source
had
no
authority
to
give
it
to
him.
working
quickly
over
a
weekend,
he
rushed
into
print
with
an
article
that
was
derived
almost
exclusively
from
the
memoirs.
eighty
percent
of
it
was
from
the
memoirs,
and
what
wasn't
from
the
memoirs
was
either
introduction
or
conclusion,
or
a
few
transition
sentences.
the
article
quoted
verbatim
from
several
portions
of
the
manuscript.
it
included
president
ford's
summary
of
the
underlying
philosophy
for
pardoning
nixon.
it
included
a
vivid
description
of--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--there
was
a
quote
in
which
president
ford
summarized
his
overall
philosophy.
in
fact,
he
predated
to
the
time
when
he
was
in
law
school,
and
he
said
that
the
basic
underlying
philosophy
that
governed
my
decision
here
was
the
fact
that
public
policy
sometimes
has
to
take
precedence
over
the
rule
of
law,
then
he
went
on
and
expanded
that
somewhat,
and
that
was
quoted
verbatim.
that
particular
passage
was
quoted
verbatim.
he
also
quoted
verbatim
a
vivid
description
of
nixon's--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--president
ford's--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--that
particular
material
was
the
material
that
president
ford
created
as
he
wrote
the
book,
and
that
particular
material
was
not
available.
it
also
included
president
ford's
assessment
of
nixon's
character,
which
president
ford
had
written
out
in
longhand
during
that
interviewing
process
that
i
described,
and
that
also
was
copied
verbatim
by
nation
in
the
article.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
just
his
expression,
justice
o'connor,
as
that
term
has
been
defined
traditionally
in
the
copyright
courts.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
how
many
were
quoted?
there
was
approximately
1800
words
altogether
derived
from
the
manuscript,
and
about
700,
i
think,
were
quoted
and
the
balance
were
paraphrased.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
yes.
the
balance
constitutes
paraphrase
of
the
material
in
the
manuscript.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
the
court
of
appeals
did
a
stripping
away
exercise,
and
ended
up
with
300
words
that
in
their
view
represented
copyrightable
expression.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
well,
your
honor,
justice
white,
i
think--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--i
think
it
is
not
a
question
of
counting.
i
think
that
the
problem
is
that
the
majority--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--your
honor,
i
think
that
300
words
of
expression
should
be
protected,
certainly
in
a
manuscript
that
hasn't
been
published
yet.
but,
if
i
can
address
your
point,
it
is
not
really
a
question
of
counting
words,
i
think,
it
is
a
question
of
the
fact
that
the
majority
applied
the
wrong
standards
in
determining
copyrightability,
and
that
is
one
of
the
major
points
we
make
on
the
copyrightability.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
i
think
the
copyright
act
applies
to
protect
expression,
and
expression
has
been
defined
in
cases
to
include
the
following,
this
is
a
reading
from
a
second
circuit
case:
what
is
protected
is
the
manner
of
expression,
the
author's
analysis
or
interpretation
of
events,
the
way
he
structures
his
material
and
marshals
his
facts,
his
choice
of
words,
and
the
emphasis
he
gives
to
the
particular
developments.
"that
is
a
quote
from
the
second
circuit
opinion
in
wainwright,
and
that
was
the
definition
of
expression.
"
the
majority
in
this
case
didn't
follow
that
definition
in
determining
what
was
copyrightable
in
the
copied
portions
of
the
manuscript.
what
the
majority
did,
was
they
said,
expression
is
limited
to
barest
elements,
to
literal
copying,
to
the
ordering
and
choice
of
the
words
themselves.
we
submit
that
traditional
copyright
cases
have
always
recognized
that
copyright
protection
for
expression
goes
beyond
just
the
literal
words
themselves,
to
protect,
as
the
dissent
noted
in
this
case,
selection,
arrangement,
emphasis,
and
anything
else
that
makes
original.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
the
reason
for
the
difference.
the
majority
applied,
we
submit,
an
incorrect
standard
in
a
second
respect.
they
adopted
a
dissection--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--i
think
it
is
certainly
possible,
justice
white,
that
there
could
be
a
violation
in
that
situation,
but
that,
of
course,
isn't
the
situation
here.
here
there
was
use
of
exact
language.
indeed,
the
editor
of
the
nation
magazine
testified
that
he
took
this
passage,
he
said,
because
that
was
ford's
own
way
of
saying
it.
he
took
another
passage,
he
said,
because
of
the
absolutely
certainty
with
which
ford
addressed
himself.
he
took
still
another
passage
because...
he
quoted
it
because
it
was
a
much
more
powerful
statement
for
the
reader.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
i
think
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
published
doesn't
expand
the
scope
of
what
is
protectable,
but
it
is
certainly
a
very
important
factor
in
determining
fair
use.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
president
ford
has
a
discussion
in
the
book
that
describes
his
discussions
with
alexander
haig
during
that
eight-day
period
prior
to
the
time
that
he
became
president.
he
covered
a
lot
of
that
same
material
in
the
hungate
testimony,
but
the
material
in
the
book,
if
you
compare
the
two,
has
quite
a
different
emphasis
from
what
it
has
in
hungate.
the
material
in
the
book
includes
president
ford's
subjective
feelings
about
those
events.
he
tells
how,
for
example,
president
nixon
had
reassured
him
over
many
months
that
he
would
ultimately
prevail,
and
that
the
facts
would
justify
him.
he
says
how
hurt
he
was,
the
deep
hurt
that
he
had
when
that
material
was
revealed.
he
includes
also
the
reaction
of
his
aides
to
alexander
haig's
discussion
of
the
pardon,
and
how
they
reacted
to
that.
all
of
that
creates
a
subjective...
it
gives
the
subjective
feelings
that
ford
had
during
those
things.
president
ford
testified
in
his
deposition
that
what
he
tried
to
add
to
the
book
was
the
more
subjective,
the
more
personal
feelings
that
went
through
his
mind
for
the
time
the
pardon
became
a
possibility.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
no,
there
really
isn't
because
our
position,
and
i
think
the
district
court's
position
was
that
the
totality
of
ford's
expression
is
copyrightable.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
the
quote
itself,
your
honor,
don't
i
think
it
was
copyrightable,
but
we
are
not
so
contending
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
the
reason
why
it
is
not
copyrightable,
and
we
are
not
contending
it
is,
is
that
the
quote
itself
was
disclosed.
it
is
the
same
thing
that
president
ford
said
in
the
hungate
testimony,
and
that
would
get
into
a
very
difficult
question,
copyright
protection
for
government
work.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
still
another
example,
your
honor,
president
ford
describes
many
factors
that
influenced
him
in
granting
the
pardon,
the
advice
that
he
received
from
various
people,
and
the
advice
that
he
received
from
henry
ruth,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
our
position
is
that
the
totality
of
that
expression,
including
the
advice
and
the
reaction
that
ford
had
to
it
represents
ford's
expression.
the
nation
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
what
one
should
do
in
determining
copyrightability
is
to
look
at
each
of
those
little
pieces
of
advice
separately
and
say,
well,
this
is
not
copyrightable,
and
therefore
that
is
not
entitled
to
further
consideration.
we
both
agree
that
the
ruth
memorandum
per
se
is
not
copyrightable.
we
urge
that
president
ford's
entire
expression,
including
the
ruth
memorandum
and
the
impact
it
had
on
him,
represents
copyrightable
expression
as
it
has
been
traditionally
viewed
by
the
courts--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that
fact
should
affect
copyrightability.
i
think
it
might
affect
fair
use,
but
after
the
book
is
published.
i
think
our
position
is
that
before
the
book
is
published,
president
ford
ought
to
have
the
same
right
that
any
author
has,
the
right
of
first
publication.
president
ford
took
two
years
to
write
this
book.
this
harvest
of
knowledge
that
was
so
important
to
the
majority
in
which
we
concur,
that
harvest
of
knowledge
came
about
because
president
ford
spent
two
years
writing
the
book.
we
submit
that
having
put
that
effort,
he's
entitled
to
the
right
that
the
copyright
laws
have
given
him,
namely,
the
right
of
first
publication.
i
would
like
to
also
just
go
back
to
the
copyrightability
point.
the
majority,
in
addition
to
the
two
other
factors
that
i
mentioned,
also
gave
no
consideration
to
the
paraphrasing
here,
stating
that
paraphrasing
is
the
equivalent
of
copying
only
if
the
copier
has
copied
virtually
the
entire
work.
we
submit
that
the
cases
don't
support
that
interpretation
of
a
copyright.
in
essence,
the
majority
imposed
these...
applied
these
limited
restrictions
on
copyrightability
because
of
its
belief
that
to
do
otherwise
would
give
president
ford
a
monopoly
over
facts.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
true.
it
would
only
give
president
ford
protection
for
his
expression
of
those
facts.
furthermore,
that
protection
is
not
unlimited.
it
is
protection
that
is
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
fair
use
doctrine.
on
the
fair
use
doctrine--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--they
could
certainly
reveal
the
information,
but
they
couldn't
take
his
expression.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
justice
white,
and
we
submit
that
the
majority,
in
making
that
determination,
applied
a
number
of
standards
that--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--it
has
to
be
a
literal
quote,
and
such
as--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
justice
white,
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
looking
at
the
material
and
exercising
judgment.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
what
i
think
the
district
court
did
in
this
case
was
the
district
court
took
the
ford
material
and
compared
it
in
its
totality
with
what
the
nation
did,
and
said,
overall
this
is
substantially
similar
and,
therefore,
infringement.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
that
is
the
test
of
infringement,
yes,
and
i
think
that's
the
test
that
has
to
be
applied
when
you
are
dealing
with
paraphrase.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
on
the
fair
use
branch
of
the
case,
we
urge
that
the
fundamental
flaw
of
the
court,
or
a
fundamental
flaw
of
the
court
was
in
its
belief
that
in
some
way
a
decision
was
required
in
order
to
facilitate
the
harvest
of
knowledge
so
essential
to
a
democratic
state.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
i
think
in
the
nation
sentence
by
sentence
analysis,
they
have
a
chart,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
they
have
a
little
red
line
underneath
the
stuff
that
they
say
or
concede
is
possibly
expression,
or
they
are
arguable
expressions,
or
something
like
that.
i
think
that
that
is
probably
where
the
300
words
comes
from.
it
is
probably
the
count
of
the
material
that
the
nation
conceded
was
expression.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
really,
everything
in
yellow
is
what
we
contend
was
copyrightable.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
that
was
part
of
the
holding
below,
and
our
contention
is
that
the
majority
shouldn't
have
dismissed
paraphrasing
so
lightly
because
it
can
indeed--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--no.
i
think
that
everything
that
is
yellowed
in
our
appendix
c
to
the
cert
petition,
which
comes
to
about
1800
words,
was
in
fact
copied
from
the--
mr.
edward
a.
miller
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
yes,
that's
correct.
as
i
said,
the
court
below
acted
on
the
premise
or
the
underlying
philosophy
that
the
decision
was
necessary
in
order
to
facilitate
the
harvest
of
knowledge
so
necessary
to
a
democratic
state.
but
the
material
was
about
to
be
harvested
by
president
ford
himself,
and
nothing
that
the
nation
did
in
any
way
facilitated
that.
what
the
nation
did
was
to
arrogate
to
itself
author's
right
of
first
publication.
author
ford
had
spent
two
years
writing
this
book,
and
the
nation
took
it
upon
itself
to
be
the
first
publisher
or,
to
use
the
nation's
words,
"to
scoop
the
president
on
his
own
memoirs.
"
as
i
think
i
have
already
suggested,
the
majority
believed
that
this
policy
of
facilitating
the
harvest
of
knowledge
was
somehow
at
odds
with
the
copyright
act.
we
submit
that
it
is
not.
the
copyright
act
indeed
has
that
very
same
purpose,
to
reward
authors
so
that
authors
will
go
cut
and
spend
the
time
and
effort
necessary
to
write
their
books
so
that
the
public
will
have
the
benefit
of
that.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
and
so
that
they'll
get
some
royalties,
too.
but
the
copyright
act
provides
an
economic
incentive,
and
the
real
underlying
purpose
of
that
is
the
purpose
that
the
public
will
get
the
benefit
of
their
writings.
i
would
like
to
just
talk
briefly
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
copyright
act
because
that
makes
clear
that
the
fact
that
work
is
unpublished
means
that
the
fair
use
doctrine
has
narrow
applicability.
the
court
disregarded
that
completely.
that
statement
that
the
author's
right
of
first
publication
ought
to
prevail
appears
in
committee
reports,
the
1966
and
'67
house
report.
it
appears
in
the
'76...
the
'75
senate
report.
it
didn't
appear
in
the
final
house
report
only
for
one
reason,
and
that
is
that
the
parties
had
gotten
together
and
agreed
on
specific
guidelines.
but
the
house
went
out
of
its
way
to
refer
to
its
earlier
discussion,
and
to
say,
we
still
think
that
that
earlier
discussion
has
validity,
and
it
still
has
value
for
an
analysis
of
the
various
aspects
of
the
problem.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
have
some
time
left,
i
would
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
i
have
no
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
justice
o'connor,
if
that
happened,
there
would
be
one
significant
change
in
one
of
the
fair
use
factors,
and
a
possible
change
in
the
other.
mr.
edward
a.
miller
it
could
be,
but
i
can't
answer
yes
or
no
because
it
would
depend
upon
the
economic
impact
of
the
use.
a
significant
factor
that
would
change
is
that
it
would
be
a
published
manuscript.
if
he
did
this
after
the
book
came
out,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
have
caused
economic
harm,
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
significant
factor.
by
doing
it
before
the
book
came
out,
he
caused
us
to
lose
the
benefit
of
the
first
serial
license
deal
that
we
made.
it
is
possible
that
if
he
came
out
with
his
article
after
the
book
came
out
that
it
wouldn't
receive
very
much
attention
because,
after
all,
he
didn't
add
anything
to
what
president
ford
said
in
the
article.
thank
you.
