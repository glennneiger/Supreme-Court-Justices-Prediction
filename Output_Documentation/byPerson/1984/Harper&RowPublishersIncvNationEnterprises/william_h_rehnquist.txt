do
you
have
any
idea
of
how
many
words
to
the
page?
justice
rehnquist
you
say,
mr.
miller,
that
it
included
president
ford's
summary
of
his
reasons
for
the
pardon,
do
you
mean
by
that
that
it
quoted
directly
or
that
it
simply
paraphrased?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
miller,
it
isn't
just
a
question
that
he
who
reads
may
count
as
to
how
many
words
were
copyrightable,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
one
view
of
copyrightability,
and
i
take
it
that
you
have
a
somewhat
broader
view,
and
that
is
why
you
reach
a
higher
number.
justice
rehnquist
paraphrase
then
includes
the
idea
that
even
though
there
is
not
literal
quotation,
there
is
so
much
similarity
in
arrangement,
the
sentence
structure,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
1800
words
were
copied,
do
you
say
that
every
one
of
those
1800
words
was
copyrightable?
justice
rehnquist
so
that
they'll
get
some
royalties.
justice
rehnquist
it
does
protect,
doesn't
it,
mr.
abrams,
a
particular
method
of
describing
a
fact.
justice
rehnquist
how
about
to
the
time
excerpt?
justice
rehnquist
so
he
never
saw
that.
justice
rehnquist
why
did
you
have
all
the
expert
witnesses,
then,
in
the
district
court
testifying
that
something
was
journalistically
proper
if
courts
can't
review
that?
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
they
testified
that
something
was
done
well
from
a
journalistic
standpoint.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
abrams.
justice
rehnquist
i
didn't
understand
your
opponent
to
go
that
far
in
his
concept
of
paraphrasing,
that
simply
a
relating
of
the
same
of
the
factual
account
would
would
automatically
be
described
as
paraphrasing.
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say,
30
chapters--
justice
rehnquist
--or
300
words
out
of
the
book
if
he
is
simply--
justice
rehnquist
--okay.
you
say,
a
chapter,
let's
say,
a
chapter
of
ten
pages,
300
words
to
a
page,
3,000
words.
there
you
say
that
harper
&
row
is
protected.
you
say
if
you
get
down
to
one
page,
you
have
to
apply
the
fair
use
analysis.
is
there
any
line
in-between
there?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
kind
of
fair
use
example
you
give
of
president
ford
is
in
the
context
of
a
work
which
bears
the
imprint...
the
individual
imprint
of
an
author.
here
this
nation
thing
didn't
really
add
anything
original
to
what
is
found
in
the
ford
memoirs.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
most
book
reviews
contain
the
reviewer's
appraisal
of
the
work
as
a
piece
of
literature.
