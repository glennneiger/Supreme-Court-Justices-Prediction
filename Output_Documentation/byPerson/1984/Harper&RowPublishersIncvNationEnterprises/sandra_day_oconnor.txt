justice
o'connor
mr.
miller,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
copyright
allows
president
ford
to
license
publication
of
those
facts,
or
just
his
written
expression
or
choice
of
words
in
expressing?
justice
o'connor
mr.
miller,
do
you
think
that
the
fact
that
it
was
an
unpublished
work
expands
your
definition
of
what
is
protectable
under
the
copyright
law,
or
is
the
fact
that
it
was
unpublished
in
your
view
just
one
element
of
determining
fair
use?
justice
o'connor
do
the
300
words
represent
just
the
direct
quotes?
justice
o'connor
do
you
not
concede
that
paraphrasing
other
words
could
constitute
a
copyright
violation?
justice
o'connor
and
perhaps
this
case.
justice
o'connor
why
are
direct
quotes
or
direct
paraphrasing
of
an
author's
expression
essential
to
news
reporting?
why
can't
they
be
rewritten?
justice
o'connor
didn't
mr.
navasky
himself
testify
that
the
words
quoted
had
a
definitive
quality
and
were
a
more
powerful
statement
than
he
himself
could
have
written.
isn't
that
the
very
essence
of
what
is
protected?
justice
o'connor
the
first
publication
right
is
not
a
factor
for
consideration
in
fair
use?
justice
o'connor
what
about
this
case?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
right
of
first
publication
is
a
right
encompassed
under
section
106
of
the
law?
justice
o'connor
do
you
look
at
the
negative
effect
on
the
potential
market
and
value?
justice
o'connor
wouldn't
that
be
a
factor
here
to
worry
about?
justice
o'connor
i
understood
your
opponent
to
concede
that
fair
use
was
a
proper
question
for
inquiry
here,
but
he
takes
the
view
that
whether
it
is
a
first
publication
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
under
fair
use.
you
say,
it's
not.
justice
o'connor
is
that
the
essence
of
the
difference?
justice
o'connor
mr.
miller,
may
i
ask
one
question,
please.
if
the
article
were
published
in
the
nation
after
the
publication
of
president
ford's
book,
would
that
be
a
copyright
violation?
justice
o'connor
yes
or
no,
a
violation
or
not?
