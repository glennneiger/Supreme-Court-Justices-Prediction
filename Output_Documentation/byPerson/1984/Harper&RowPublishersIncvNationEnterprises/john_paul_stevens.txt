mr.
miller,
it
would
be
helpful
to
me,
in
trying
to
focus
on
the
difference
between
your
two
positions,
if
you
could
identify
one
or
two
of
the
passages
that
you
think
are
clearly
copyrightable,
and
they
think
are
not,
because
talking
in
generalities,
it
is
always
a
little
hard
to
focus
on
what
the
difference
is.
justice
stevens
one
of
the
examples
that
you
have
given,
i
guess,
is
this
written
statement
that
president
ford
read
to
general
haig
over
the
telephone,
i
guess
it
was.
is
there
a
dispute
between
you
as
to
whether
that
particular
writing
was
copyrightable?
justice
stevens
just
take
the
quote
itself,
is
that
in
your
view
copyrightable?
justice
stevens
is
see.
justice
stevens
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
your
entire
position.
you
are
saying
that
that
statement
as
a
part
of
his
general
description
of
that
particular
event
was
copyrightable?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
just
one
other
question
here.
on
some
of
these
example,
do
you
think
the
that
president
ford
is
not
an
ordinary
author
affects
the
determination
of
the
copyrightability
of
some
of
this
material?
in
other
words,
there
is
newsworthiness
in
the
fact
that
he
was
the
president
of
united
states
when
he
had
these
views,
as
distinguished
from
someone
else
who
might
just
have
been
narrating
about
them.
justice
stevens
mr.
miller,
could
i
interrupt
once
more.
i'm
sorry,
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
is
there
anything
that
tells
us
which
300
words
the
court
of
appeals
and
your
opponent
agree
are
copyrightable,
and
which
words
you
agree
are
not
copyrightable?
do
we
have
anything
that
really
tells
us?
justice
stevens
conversely,
everything
in
yellow
you
contend
is
copyrightable.
