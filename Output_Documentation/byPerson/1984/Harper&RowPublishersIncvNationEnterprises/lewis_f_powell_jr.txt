the
copyright
act
applies
to
works,
as
i
understand
it,
not
to
words.
is
that
correct?
justice
jr.
it
uses
the
term
"works",
doesn't
it?
justice
jr.
mr.
abrams,
did
the
editor
of
the
nation
know
that
time
magazine
was
going
to
publish
an
article
on
the
book?
justice
jr.
he
was
trying
to
scoop
the
publication
by
time
in
the
vernacular
of
the
news
business?
justice
jr.
did
mr.
navasky
contribute
anything
to
the
article
itself,
beyond
what
he
obtained
from
the
ford
manuscript?
justice
jr.
besides
condensation.
justice
jr.
were
any
of
his
ideas
incorporated
into
that?
justice
jr.
you
characterize
this
as
objective
reporting
or
editorializing?
justice
jr.
would
you
repeat
what
you
have
said
about
the
first
factor,
whether
or
not
publication
was
for
commercial
purposes
rather
than
for
non-profit,
educational
purposes.
this
was
certainly
commercial,
wasn't
it?
justice
jr.
is
it
not
commercial
in
every
sense
in
that
you
knew
that
the
material
would
be
published
by
time
in
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
weeks?
justice
jr.
you
flunk
that
test.
justice
jr.
but
you
do
start
with
copyrighted
material,
don't
you,
which
is
a
little
different
from
most
news
reporting.
justice
jr.
this
was
copyrighted,
wasn't
it?
justice
jr.
was
the
book
copyrighted?
