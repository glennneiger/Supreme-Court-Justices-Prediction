justice
white
how
many
total
words
were
quoted,
actually
quoted?
justice
white
seven
hundred
were
quoted?
justice
white
how
many
did
the
court
of
appeals
think
were
quoted?
justice
white
whose
word
should
we
take?
justice
white
do
we
have
to
count
them?
justice
white
you
say
that
it
included
a
summary
of
his
philosophy
going
back
to
law
school,
an
assessment
of
president
nixon's
character.
if
it
gets
down
to
300
words,
that
is
getting
pretty
short
to
cover
those
fields,
isn't
it?
justice
white
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
even
there
was
not
a
single
instance
in
this
story
that
you
could
identify
as
a
literal
quote,
you
would
think
that
there
could
be
a
violation
of
copyright.
justice
white
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
president
ford,
in
his
memoirs,
revealed
that
an
event
that
no
one
had
ever
known
about
before
and
he
described
that
event,
do
you
say
that
no
one
could
reveal
that
event
without
violating
his
copyright?
justice
white
yes.
it
is
just
a
question
of
when
in
the
process
of
revealing
the
event,
they
are
close
enough
to
his
expression
to
get
in
trouble?
justice
white
such
as
it
has
to
be
a
literal
quote,
or
something.
justice
white
you
say,
it
can
also
violate
if
it
is
just
a
paraphrase.
justice
white
how
do
you
recognize
a
paraphrase
when
you
meet
it
on
the
street?
justice
white
as
to
whether
it
is
practically
the
same
thing
as
the
quote?
justice
white
substantially
similar,
that
is
your
test?
justice
white
is
that
the
total
question,
that
it
is
copyrightable?
i
thought
there
might
have
been
an
awful
lot
of
things
in
the
memoirs
that
were
copyrightable,
but
the
claim
is
there
that
there
was
no
violation
because
it
was
a
paraphrase.
isn't
part
of
the
holding
below
that
there
wasn't
a
violation
of
the
copyright
because
it
was
only
a
paraphrase?
justice
white
do
you
say
that...
the
court
below
said
300,
and
you
say
700?
justice
white
you
are
just
saying,
because
it
was
a
violation
of
copyrightable
material?
justice
white
eighteen
hundred
words.
justice
white
it
is
just
as
though
president
ford
used
those
words.
justice
white
but
you
also
say
that
that
300
can
be
published
under
the
rubric
of
fair
use.
justice
white
even
if
it
is
the
essence
of
the
article.
justice
white
i
hope
you
have
a
good
litmus
paper
test
to
identify
news
as
compared
to
what
is
newsworthy.
justice
white
you
suggest
that
there
is
a
lot
of
news
that's
not
newsworthy.
justice
white
mr.
abrams,
you
got
us
up
to
700
words
with
that
memorandum.
your
opponent
says
that
he
is
really
talking
about
1800
words.
are
the
700
included
in
the
1800
words,
or
is
the
1800
in
addition
to
that?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
i
got
you.
justice
white
thank
you.
