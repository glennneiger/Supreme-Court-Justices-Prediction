mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
copyright
law
protects
works
of
authorship,
and
president
ford
wrote
a
book
which
was
properly
copyrighted.
we
have
never
disputed
the
fact
that
the
book
was
copyrightable
in
its
totality,
and
copyrighted.
the
copyright
law
also,
as
mr.
miller
said,
does
not
protect
facts,
and
it
doesn't
protect
certain
other
things
as
to
which
we
seem
not
to
be
in
disagreement,
for
example,
government
works.
it
does
not
protect
other
information
of
one
sort
or
another.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
protects
expression,
justice
renquist,
which
indeed
is
very
often
a
way
of
describing
a
fact.
it
doesn't
protect
ideas.
it
doesn't
protect
facts.
it
does
protect,
as
the
second
circuit
said,
the
structure
and
mosaic
of
a
work,
but
it
doesn't
protect
expression.
the
second
circuit
went
through
a
process
of
looking
to
see
what
part
of
what
was
before
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
as
to
which
president
ford
could
bring
a
law
suit
on
against
the
nation.
let
me
give
you,
if
i
may,
first
the
numbers,
which
some
members
of
the
court
have
asked
for,
in
terms
of
quotations
and
the
like.
we
deal
here
with
a
manuscript
of
655
pages
written
by
president
ford,
approximately
200,000
words.
we
deal
with
an
article
by
the
nation
of
three
pages
of
a
total
of
2250
words.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
the
starting
cut,
i
think.
there
are
cases
in
other
areas
in
which
a
small
amount
of
words
has
been
held
to
violate
the
copyright
law.
there
are
other
cases,
betamax,
in
which
100
percent
does
not
violate.
it
does
depend
upon
the
case,
but
we
are
starting
out,
i
think,
fairly,
talking
about,
if
we
are
right,
and
if
the
second
circuit
is
right
in
saying
that
it
is
300
words,
in
comparing
the
300
words
to
the
book
or,
if
you
will,
to
the
chapters,
which
relate
to
the--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--the
time
excerpt
wasn't
in
existence,
and
never
got
written,
your
honor.
mr.
navasky
didn't
have
that
or
knowledge
of
it,
so
i
can't
compare
it
to
that.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir,
he
never
saw
it,
and
so
far
as
i
know
it
never
came
into
existence
at
all.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
300
words
represent
direct
quotes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
do
concede
that,
justice
o'connor.
it
seems
to
me,
and
indeed
the
law
says,
that
if
you
track
something
slavishly
enough,
it
can
indeed
constitute
a
copyright
violation,
and
there
are
lots
of
cases
in
which
parties
have
just
about
literally
tracked
what
someone
else
wrote,
and
put
in
a
little
word
here
and
there,
the
wainwright
case
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
the
wainwright
case
in
the
second
circuit
seems
to
me
an
example
of
what
is
not
involved
here.
the
wainwright
case
is
a
case
in
which
a
financial
publisher
went
out
and
collected
all
the
recommendations
to
prospective
buyers
by
kitty
peabody
sayings
and
in
the
news
article,
so
called,
was
kitty
peabody
said
today
this,
they
said
that,
they
said
that,
and
they
said
that.
it
was
the
totality
of
what
they
were
saying.
it
was
a
practice
of
what
they
were
doing
again
and
again
in
article
after
article.
i
think
that
there
is
a
word
or
two
words
to
describe
what
the
nation
was
engaged
in
today,
it
is
news
reporting.
one
may
like
it
or
not,
but
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
which
for
fair
use
purposes,
which
i
haven't
reached
yet
congress
defined
as
a
paradigmatic
example
of
what
is
protected.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
can
be
rewritten
less
well,
less
probingly,
less
meaningfully.
there
was
expert
testimony
on
that
very
subject.
all
the
testimony
was,
both
in
the
amount
that
was
used,
and
in
the
nature
of
the
quotations
that
were
used,
i
mean
literally
all
of
it
thought
that
it
was
reasonable
in
journalistic
terms,
and
that
it
was
reasonable
from
the
point
of
view
of
authors.
mr.
halberstam,
for
example,
testifying,
as
all
the
experts
did,
uncontradicted,
gave
examples
of
that.
mr.
floyd
abrams
justice
o'connor,
those
words
are
protected,
and
we
agree
with
that.
that
is
where
we
get
to
300
words,
that
at
least
is
a
common
ground
as
regards
sore
of
the
words.
how
mr.
nixon
looked
in
the
hospital,
for
example,
that
is
pure
expression.
we
don't
have
any
disagreement
with
that.
what
president
ford
learned
or
says
that
he
learned
at
yale
law
school
is
expression,
and
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that.
that
is
how
we
get
to
300
words.
where
we
disagree...
where
we
disagree
on
numbers
or
where
the
second
circuit
is
not
the
same
as
what
my
brother
here
has
said
to
you
today
is
how
to
do
the
counting,
how
to
do
the
analysis
of
that.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fair
use,
we
argue
that
the
300
words,
as
a
matter
of
law--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--it
is
not
the
essence
of
the
article.
the
essence
of
the
article,
as
all
agree,
is
the
story
of
the
pardon
by
one
president
of
his
predecessor
president,
who
in
fact
appointed
him.
mr.
floyd
abrams
by
the
time
the
article
was
published
in
the
nation,
he
was
aware
that
time
magazine
was
going
to
publish
something.
he
didn't
know
what,
and
he
wasn't
aware
of
that
at
the
time
that
he
received
the
manuscript.
mr.
floyd
abrams
in
a
sense,
mr.
navasky
testified
that
he
wanted
to
be
first,
yes,
sir,
and
he
testified
that
he
wanted
to
be
first
because
he
wanted
to
put
his
own
perspective
on
it.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
two
things.
one
is
summarized.
if
news
reporting
is
presumptively
protected.
mr.
floyd
abrams
in
one
way
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
navasky
testified
that
by
his
selection
and
choice
of
the
material
with
respect
to
the
pardon,
he
thought
that
a
reader
would
come
out,
when
you
strip
of
expression,
as
mr.
navasky
did,
when
you
strip
what
president
ford
was
saying
of
how
he
felt,
which
mr.
navasky
generally
did,
that
you
come
out
with
a
view
of
the
pardon
which
involved
at
least
a
strong
sense
that
it
may
have
been
the
result
of
improper
behavior.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
have
to
say,
justice
powell,
i
think
it's
some
of
both.
it
is
a
summary
on
the
one
hand,
and
it
is
a
summary
to
make
a
point
on
the
other.
what
i
would
certainly
characterize
it
as
is
news
reporting.
one
of
the
areas
that
the
district
court
erred
in
was
in
passing
a
sort
of
judgment
on
it.
he
said
that
it
was
"poor"
journalism.
one
of
the
things
that
we
have
urged
on
you
in
our
briefs
is
that,
be
that
as
it
may,
whatever
mr.
navasky
might
think
or,
if
i
may,
what
any
of
us
might
think
here,
that's
not
the
business
of
courts.
mr.
floyd
abrams
what
we
called
them
for
was
to
deal
with
various
aspects
of
fair
use.
courts
can
deal
with
the
fair
use
factors,
and
anything
that
is
relevant
to
fair
use.
mr.
floyd
abrams
they
testified
to
the
amount
that
was
taken,
for
example,
part
iii
of
fair
use,
they
didn't
take
any
more
than
was
necessary.
it
was
honorable
and
reasonable.
that,
we
thought,
was
a
matter
for
expert
opinion.
i
went
perhaps
farther
than
i
had
to
in
having
experts
testify
that
the
information
wasn't
only
news,
but
was
newsworthy.
maybe
we
didn't
have
to
do
that.
but
we
were
not
making
the
case,
and
we
made
it
very
clear
to
the
court
again
and
again,
that
our
view
at
least
was
that
the
standard
to
he
applied
was
not
whether
it
was
a
great
news
story,
but
whether
it
was
really
a
news
story.
what
the
second
circuit
said
was,
the
question
is
when
a
party
comes
before
a
court,
and
is
arguing
fair
use
and
saying
this
is
"news
reporting",
the
question
is,
is
that
true
or
not?
is
it
a
pretext
or
not
to
say
that.
in
wainwright,
the
second
circuit
said
that
it
was
a
pretext.
you
can't
just
say
that
it's
news
reporting
and
make
it
news
reporting.
it
matters
because
news
reporting
is
set
forth
by
congress,
at
least,
as
an
example
of
what
is
presumptively
protected
as
fair
use.
it
doesn't
answer
all
the
questions,
but
it's
a
start
once
one
gets
to
fair
use
analysis.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
got
into,
justice
white,
arguments
about
whether
something
has
to
be
news.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
suggest
that
news
doesn't
have
to
be
new,
and
that
was
one
of
the
areas
we
drifted
off
on
to
at
trial.
mr.
floyd
abrams
as
any
book
is,
your
honor,
sure.
i
don't
have
any
doubt
that
harper
&
row
wanted
to
sell
what
it
had,
and
that
it
did
so.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
don't
know
if
anything
is
really
commercially
valuable
to
the
nation,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
am
sorry,
i
meant
the
magazine.
all
i
meant
was
the
magazine.
i
suppose
in
a
sense,
at
least
i
would
have
to
concede,
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
that
mr.
navasky
may
have
hoped
long
range
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
magazine,
and
that
eventually
they
would
sell
more
copies.
they
sold
418
copies
of
this
altogether
on
newsstands,
so
it's
not
the
sort
of
thing
one
would
ordinarily
think
of
in
terms
of
magazines
or
newspapers.
if
i
might,
your
honor,
though,
i'd
like
to
continue
a
proposal
your
question
with
the
question
of
what
is
copyrightable
and
what's
not,
because
essentially
what
the
second
circuit
did
was
to
say,
we
look
at
this
in
two
ways.
first,
we
see
what
is
it
that
we're
supposed
to
count,
so
to
speak.
the
whole
work
is
copyrighted.
i
say
again,
there
is
no
question
about
that,
president
ford
wrote
a
copyrightable
work.
but
it's
clear,
and
we
don't
disagree
with
our
opponents,
that
we
are
entitled
as
a
general
matter
to
make
what
professor
latman
called
"unlimited
use"
of
material
in
that
copyrighted
work
which
is
not
copyrighted
subject
to
however
this
court
comes
out
on
the
issue
of
structure,
mosaic,
or
whatever.
justice
stevens
asked
earlier
for
some
examples
and,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
just
cite
one
or
two
to
give
you
an
example
of
where
we
think
the
court
can
look
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
second
circuit
approach
was
a
correct
approach.
at
page
633
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
the
midst
of
our
paragraph
by
paragraph
analysis
of
the
article,
we
quote
from
the
article
in
paragraph
4...
of
the
nation
article.
paragraph
4
of
the
nation
article
says,
and
i
will
just
paraphrase
it
now,
that
ford's
account
contained
significant
new
details
on
the
negotiations
and
consideration
when
the
subject
was
first
broached
to
him
by
general
haig
on
august
1st,
1974.
general
haig
revealed
that
the
newly
transcribed
white
house
tapes
were
the
equivalent
of
the
smoking
gun,
et
cetera.
that
came
from
what
we
then
annex
immediately
after
page
633,
which
is
pages
634,
635,
636,
and
637.
it
was,
i
would
use
the
word,
news,
if
you
went
to
say
condensed,
paraphrased,
it
was
a
report
about
that
aspect
of
what
president
ford
did.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
example
that
mr.
miller
cited.
i
think
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
ruth
memorandum.
at
page
654
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
is
a
paragraph
from
the
nation
article
in
which
the
nation
wrote
that
the
precipitating
factor
in
ford's
decision
was
a
series
of
secret
meetings.
then
they
go
down
to
say
that
ford's
cites
a
memorandum
from
henry
ruth
as
being
especially
persuasive.
"ruth
had
written".
where
we
disagree
is
this.
president
ford
never
owned
the
ruth
memorandum,
and
we
believe
that
he
doesn't
own
it
today.
what
the
district
court
said
was
that
when
you
put
the
ruth
memorandum
together
with
how
president
ford
used
it,
the
totality
was
protected,
and
that
is
why
we
get
to
700
words,
because
they
include
the
ruth
memorandum
in
the
700
words.
our
position
is
that
the
totality
doctrine
is
absolutely
unprecedented
in
copyright
law,
and
terribly
dangerous
because
that
doctrine
would,
in
fact,
give
harper
&
row
a
monopoly
of
the
story
of
the
pardon
of
president
nixon
by
president
ford.
i
want
to
add
one
thing
to
it.
they're
right
when
they
say
that
the
monopoly
they
would
get
is
the
monopoly
in
president
ford's
version
of
that
story.
that's
true.
mr.
navasky
could
have
gone
out
and
written
a
whole
article
about
the
pardon,
but
his
article
was
about
president
ford's
version
of
the
pardon.
what
i
believe
their
argument
comes
down
to
is
that
that
sort
of
article
cannot
be
written
about
at
least
published
work
without
violating
the
copyright
law.
that's
what
it
is,
because
if
you
once
say,
you
can't
paraphrase,
what
you
are
saying
is,
you
can't
report
what
the
books
says
about
that,
what
happened
next.
there
were
events
that
happened
one
after
another.
if
you
say
that
the
ruth
memorandum
gets
scores
of--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
don't
understand
him
to
go
that
far
in
paraphrasing,
your
honor.
i
understand
that
when
you
put
together...
it
is
my
view,
at
least,
that
when
you
put
together
their
argument
about
paraphrasing
with
the
lower
court's
ruling
about
the
totality
of
the
work,
when
you
put
all
that
together,
what
you
are
seeing
is,
for
example,
an
entirety
of
the
depiction
of
the
pardon.
there
are
19
paragraphs
in
the
nation
article,
all
of
that,
they
say,
what,
comes
from,
it
is
about
president
ford's
version
of
the
pardon.
it
is
one
thing
to
say,
we
can't
do
that
at
all,
but
as
mr.
miller
said
in
response
to
a
question
that
he
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
not
based
on
the
amount
of
words
that
he
is
talking
about.
his
position
and
the
lower
court's
position
was
that
when
you
looked
at
it
all
together,
this
was
president
ford's
version,
this
was
his
depiction
of
the
pardon.
our
position
is
that
this
was
an
article
about
president
ford's
depiction
of
the
pardon.
i
agree
that
if
this
depiction
had
gotten
so
close
at
such
length
so
that
like
wainwright
this
was
just
a
fraud,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
sir,
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
conceding
my
client
was
not
allowed
to
do,
was
to
take
a
chapter
out
of
the
book
and
change
a
few
words.
mr.
floyd
abrams
when
you
start
to
get
down,
justice
renquist,
to
300
words,
then
i
think
you
have
to
apply
standard
fair
use
analysis.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
should
have
said,
i
misspoke
a
moment
ago,
you
have
to
use
fair
use
analysis
no
matter
what
you
get
down
to.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
first
you
have
to
see
what
it
is
that
you
are
looking
at,
what
is
the
fair
document,
what
is
the
fair
amount
of
words,
or
whatever,
that
you
are
looking
at,
then
you
apply
fair
use
analysis.
is
there
a
line
that
you
use?
i
think
you
start
with
what
congress
said.
congress
gave
four
factors
to
look
at,
they
are
not
exclusive.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
pre-publication,
justice
o'connor,
can
be
a
factor
in
a
particular
type
of
case.
for
example,
if
this
were
a
case--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--this
case,
no.
we
don't
think
the
factor
that
it
is
pre-publication
is
a
factor
in
this
case.
we
read
the
legislative
history
differently
than
our
friends,
but
not
just
that.
we
look
at
a
statute
which,
when
it
wants
to,
distinguishes
between
published
and
unpublished
works,
and
that
is
what
the
copyright
law
does
in
section
104
and
108,
302
and
412.
congress
said
in
a
number
of
situation,
we
are
going
to
treat
published
and
unpublished
works
in
a
different
way,
but
that
is
not
that
they
did
here.
we
look
at
a
statute
which
says,
news
reporting
is
a
paradigmatic
example
of
fair
use.
we
think,
and
the
second
circuit
on
this
was
unanimous,
that
what
was
involved
here
was
news
reporting.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
the
right
of
first
publication
is
a
right
subject
to
fair
use.
everything
is
subject
to
fair
use,
that
is
what
106
says,
that
is
is
subject
to
107.
so
when
one
applies
fair
use,
it
seems
to
me
one
looks
at
what
congress
said.
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
use,
and
our
answer,
and
the
second
circuit's
answer
was
news
reporting.
if
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
underlying
work,
it
is
heavily
factual,
the
certainly
heavily
factual
nature
of
the
work
in
terms
of
what
mr.
navasky
was
looking
at
and
using.
no
personal
stories,
no
vignettes,
no
stuff
which
you
can
take
from
a
book
like
that.
you
look
at
the
question
of
how
much
did
he
take
for
the
use,
and
we
have
undisputed--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
that
is
the
fourth
factor,
and
you
certainly
look
at
that.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
a
factor
here
but
only
if
the
negative
effect
was
caused
by
taking
copyrightable
material.
if
you
once
say
that
we
are
right,
that
they
are
allowed
to
write
a
summary,
a
news
article,
or
whatever,
about
the
pardon,
then
if
time
cancelled
because
the
news
was
lost,
that's
not
something
that
is
compensable
at
law.
if
time
cancelled
because
of
the
expression
that
is
something
which
would
be
compensable,
at
least
that
would
be
a
factor
against
us.
what
the
second
circuit
said
looking
at
this,
looking
at
what
it
got
it
down
to
after
it
looked
at
what
was
copyrightable
in
terms
of
what
was
involved
here,
we
had
a
situation,
the
second
circuit
said,
in
which
it
can't
be
the
case.
what
time
cancelled
about
was
the
description
of
president
ford's
yale
law
school.
everyone
agreed
that
what
the
article
was
about
was
about
the
pardon,
and
that
the
main
thrust
of
the
article
that
time
wanted
was
material
about
the
pardon.
so
on
that
factor
as
well,
we
don't
lose.
in
any
event,
we
think
we
win,
as
the
second
circuit
said,
on
the
first
three
factors.
mr.
floyd
abrams
this
is
commercial
as
opposed
to
educational,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
the
commercial
relates
to
my
client
and
not
time.
but
i
would
concede
in
any
event,
justice
powell,
that
if
the
first
factor
requires
a
simple
choice
between
whether
it
is
commercial
or
educational,
as
the
language
is--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--we
don't
flunk
it,
your
honor,
because
we
view
it
as
a
sort
of
a
sliding
scale
necessarily.
how
can
news
reporting
be
stated
by
congress
to
be
a
paradigmatic
example
of
fair
use
in
a
case
where
the
publisher
would
fail
stage
one.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
hopefully
for
profits,
justice
marshall,
but
it's
news
reporting.
that
is
why
i
pause
a
little,
justice
powell,
before
saying
that
it
is
simply
commercial.
it
is
not
like
running
it
for
an
advertisement,
for
example.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
congress
comes
right
out
and
says
that
news
reporting
is
presumptively
protected,
we
have
to
give
some
meaning
to
that,
and
the
meaning,
we
can't,
it
seems
to
me,
say
that
notwithstanding
that
news
reporting
is
listed
in
so
many
words
by
congress
in
section
107
as
an
example
of
fair
use,
that
every
example
of
news
reporting
in
every
newspaper
here
today
fails
stage
one
if
they
sell
it
for
a
profit.
that
is
why
i
think
the
only
sensible
reading,
if
i
may,
of
section
1
is
to
say
that
what
congress
did
was
to
give
two
examples.
on
one
side
of
the
scale,
it
is
pure
commercial,
and
on
the
other
side
it
is
pure
educational.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
really
isn't,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'm
sorry.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
book
was
copyrighted.
what
is
not
unusual
is
for...
president
ford
uses
the
doctrine
of
fair
use.
his
book
is
filled
with
quotations
of
what
other
people
have
said,
and
it
is
only
protected
because
of
the
fair
use
doctrine.
if
mr.
ruth,
for
example,
owned
his
memo...
he
doesn't
because
it
is
a
u.s.
memo,
the
same
with
president
ford,
he
is
not
the
owner
of
the
memo...
it
would
only
be
fair
use
to
allow
president
ford
to
quote
it,
even
though
it
may
have
been
copyrighted.
mr.
floyd
abrams
your
honor,
if
we
are
right
for
the
moment,
if
i
am
persuasive
for
the
moment
with
respect
to
the
pre-publication
and
post-publication
issue,
if
one
just
puts
that
to
the
side
for
the
moment,
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
anyone
would
say
that
this
article,
this
very
article,
published
after
publication
of
the
ford
memoirs,
violates
the
copyright
law.
it
is
inconceivable
because
of
the
amount
quoted,
because
of
all
the
factors
which
we
ordinarily
take
account
of
in
fair
use.
i
understand,
it
is
more
than
a
relevant,
it
is
a
very
central
question
to
this
case
when
one
talks
about
pre-publication
and
post-publication,
but
in
terms
of
whether
it
is
that
unusual
to
have
long
quotations
or
to
have
an
article
like
this.
book
reviews
are
filled
with
much
more
in
quotation
than
this.
mr.
floyd
abrams
news
articles
on
books
just
published
frequently
do
not,
new
articles
about
books
about
politics
in
particular.
a
book
like
this
is
a
political
event.
it
is
a
president
reflecting
and
stating
what
happened
during
his
presidency.
it
is
news
in
and
of
itself,
and
we
have
testimony
on
that.
these
things
are
not
in
dispute
on
this
record
at
least.
everyone
has
testified
as
to
that.
there
was
no
cross-examination.
there
were
no
counter-witnesses
as
to
that.
it
does
happen,
and
it
happens
with
some
frequency
that
that
a
news
article
will
be
written
about
a
book.
the
question,
to
be
sure,
the
question
is,
supposed
it
happened
before
publication,
what
difference
does
that
make?
we
cite
our
legislative
history,
and
we
cite
more
than
legislative
history.
we
cite
the
statute
to
you
which
doesn't
say
what
mr.
miller
wants
it
to
have
said,
but
it
doesn't
say
it.
we
cite
cases
to
you
which
say,
in
common
law,
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
the
hemingway
case,
for
example.
we
cite
professor
nimmer's
book
to
you
which
says,
the
leading
authority
on
copyright,
that
at
common
law
the
fact
was
that
pre-publication,
fair
use
applied...
not
that
it
did
rot
apply,
that
it
did
apply
in
common
law.
we
cite
more
recent
cases,
the
am-law
case
in
the
second
circuit
just
a
few
weeks
ago,
which
rather
routinely,
judge
winter
went
ahead
with
an
unpublished
work
and
applied
the
standard,
and
all
the
factors
under
fair
use.
if
we
are
wrong
about
published
and
unpublished
work,
if
that's
dispositive
as
mr.
miller
argues,
we
have
a
lot
of
troubles
in
this
case,
but
if
we
are
right
about
that--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
think
he
goes
farther.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
his
position
in
his
brief
is
that
fair
use
is
precluded
absent
extraordinary
circumstances
in
a
pre-publication
situation,
and
that
is
not
our
view
at
all.
if
it
were
that,
for
example,
under
section
101
of
the
copyright
law,
every
time
a
program
was
or
television,
or
a
play
is
performed,
you
would
have
to
have
extraordinary
circumstances
to
have
a
review
of
it
because
under
the
copyright
law,
that's
not
a
publication.
so
that's
what
we
are
saying
here.
we
think
what
the
second
circuit
did
as
a
matter
of
analysis
was
right
in
first
saying,
what
is
copyrightable,
what
are
we
talking
about
here,
and
then
saying,
300
words,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
factual
book,
is
fair
use.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no.
of
the
entirety
of
the
nation
article
of
2250
words--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--the
amount
quoted
is
about
700
words--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--our
opponents
say
that
an
additional
1100
words
were
paraphrased.
mr.
floyd
abrams
there
is
no
argument
about
400
words...
about
the
other
700
words.
