justice
jr.
was
it
really
a
whole
truckload?
justice
jr.
that
is
quite
a
bit,
yes.
justice
jr.
mr.
frey,
did
he
ask
if
he
could
leave?
justice
jr.
why
wasn't
he
allowed
to?
justice
jr.
at
that
time?
justice
jr.
tell
me
again,
why
wasn't
he
allowed
to
leave?
justice
jr.
any
precedent
of
ours
that
justified
that?
justice
jr.
any
precedent
of
ours
that
justified
not
letting
him
leave?
justice
jr.
how
long
was
he
in
fact
held
after
he
had--
justice
jr.
--no,
after
he
asked
to
leave.
justice
jr.
you
are
not
suggesting
there
was
probable
cause
to
detain
him,
are
you?
justice
jr.
and
would
it
make
any
difference
if
it
were
an
hour
instead
of
20
minutes?
justice
jr.
what,
if
it
were
an
hour?
that
would
be
too
long?
justice
jr.
well,
the
same
reason.
the
distance
between
the
car
and
the
truck
was
just
greater,
that's
all,
and
it
took
an
hour
for
cooke
to
get
there.
justice
jr.
two
hours?
justice
jr.
mr.
frey,
had
they
been
released
before--
justice
jr.
--was
that
it,
on
bail?
justice
jr.
and
they
forfeited
the
bail?
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
frey,
what
is
your
suggestion
as
to
the
outer
limit
of
time
in
circumstances
where
there
may
be
detention?
justice
jr.
what
formula
do
you
suggest
ought
to
guide
us?
justice
jr.
i
won't
stop
for
that
reason.
justice
jr.
i
won't
stop
for
that
reason.
justice
jr.
in
making
that
argument,
mr.
kadish,
i
haven't
heard
you
say
anything
about
the
significance
of
their
requests
to
be
allowed
to
leave.
