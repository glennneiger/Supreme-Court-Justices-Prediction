mr.
mark
j.
kadish
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
it
is
hard
for
me
to
refrain
from
calling
sharpe
and
savage
my
clients
since
they
were.
i
was
trial
counsel,
so
if
i
slip,
please
forgive
me.
there
are
certain
facts
which
mr.
frey
has
mentioned
which
i
think
need
some
clarification.
one
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
actual
stop
of
the
sharpe
vehicle,
that
was
done
by
cooke.
that
is
on
page
17
of
the
record.
he
waved
sharpe
over.
then,
over
the
radio,
thrasher
said
to
cooke,
i'll
take
the
camper.
he
then
moves
forward.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
sped
forward.
the
record
is
that
the
camper
and
the
state
trooper
vehicle
almost
hit
accidentally.
that
is
what
the
record
actually
says.
and
he
put
on
his
blue
light,
and
apparently
about
a
half
a
mile
down
the
road,
which
isn't
very
far,
they
both
succeeded
in
pulling
over
to
the...
on
the
south
side
of
the
road.
now,
you
have
both
vehicles
stopped.
cooke
gets
out
of
the
car,
and
he
goes
over
to
sharpe,
and
he
says,
give
me
your
license,
and
sharpe
gives
him
a
license
that
says
pavlovich
on
it,
but
at
that
time
cooke
doesn't
know
who
the
man
is.
so
he
thinks
he
is
pavlovich.
he
then
immediately
calls
for
myrtle
beach
police
backup.
they
arrive.
in
the
meantime,
there
is
no
colloquy
between
sharpe
and
cooke.
he
doesn't
ask
him
a
single
question
in
the
stop.
he
doesn't
say,
what
are
you
doing?
are
you
in
tandem
with
the
camper?
is
there
dope
in
the
camper?
what
are
you
doing
out
here
at
6:30
in
the
morning?
even
more
than
that,
cooke
follows
them
for
20
miles
to
this
point
from
the
beach
area
in
north
carolina,
and
during
the
entire
time
cooke
doesn't
attempt
to
raise
any
dea
people
on
the
radio,
even
though
there
is
an
entire
dea
task
force
operating
in
the
area,
to
answer
justice
blackmun's
question
about
that.
now,
what
we
have
is
that
the
vehicles
arrive
in
myrtle
beach
on
the
outskirts
and
cooke
says,
uh-oh,
i
am
going
to
lose
them
in
town.
i've
got
to
do
something
now.
i
am
really
not
sure
what
is
happening.
he
pulls
them
over,
asks
no
questions,
calls
the
myrtle
beach
backup,
they
get
them
and
put
them
in
the
back
of
a
police
car,
marked
police
car,
two
armed
officers,
and
they
sit
there
for
40
minutes.
he
takes
sharpe's
license,
puts
it
in
his
pocket,
puts
the
other
passenger
of
the
car,
who
was
never
prosecuted,
in
the
back
of
the
police
car,
leaves
them
both
there
under
armed
guard,
never
having
asked
a
question,
goes
up
the
road
and
sees
savage.
in
the
meantime,
savage
has
asked
thrasher
twice
to
leave,
right
in
the
record,
admitted
by
thrasher.
he
says,
what
do
you
want
me
for?
here
is
my
driver's
license,
here
is
my
bill
of
sale,
which
by
the
way
happened
to
be
in
the
name
of
pavlovich.
he
says,
and
i
want
to
go.
thrasher
says,
you
can't
go,
i'm
holding
you
for
cooke.
however,
if
i
really
want
to
get
you,
i
can
hold
you
for
that
speeding.
clearly,
the
record
factually
suggests
that
speeding
was
a
pretext.
at
any
event,
cooke
comes
up
and
savage
says,
i
want
to
leave,
give
me
my
license
back.
in
the
meantime,
thrasher
has
put
savage's
license
in
his
pocket.
cooke
says,
you
can't
leave.
then,
and
only
then,
cooke
looks
at
the
registration
and
sees
the
name
pavlovich,
and
the
bells
go
off,
because
he
now
connects
the
two
vehicles.
until
that
point,
there
wasn't
even
a
connection
that
they
were
traveling
in
some
kind
of
a
concerted
action
except
for
the
fact
that
they
were
just
driving
one
behind
the
other,
and
because
they
had
gone
through
the
campground
together.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
that
did
suggest,
i
agree,
justice
marshall,
that
did
suggest
that
they
were
together,
but
not
that
they
were
involved
in
criminal
activity
together,
only
that
they
were
together.
once
he
had
seen
the
name
pavlovich
on
the
registration
of
the
camper
and
on
the
driver's
license
of
sharpe,
that
drew
the
people
definitely
together.
now,
at
this
point,
sharpe,
who
has
not
been
advised
of
anything,
has
not
been
advised
of
his
rights,
has
not
been
advised
of
why
he
was
stopped,
has
not
been
advised
why
he
has
been
put
in
a
police
car
with
two
armed
officers
watching
over
him,
he
is
just
sitting
there
with
his
passenger.
forty
minutes
goes
by.
then
the
officer
goes
over
and
does
the
test
that
mr.
frey
has
mentioned.
he
steps
on
the
bumper.
it
feels
like
it
is
heavy.
he
looks
at
the
windows.
he
sees
he
can't
look
inside,
and
he
goes
to
the
truck
and
opens
the
door
himself,
pulls
out
the
keys
from
the
ignition,
opens
the
camper
lock,
and
there
are
burlap
bags.
no
marijuana,
mind
you,
but
burlap
bags
which
look
like
marijuana
that
he
has
seen
in
other
cases.
he
then
says,
you
are
under
arrest.
it
is
our
theory,
as
set
forth
in
our
brief
amicus
curiae
that
this
case
is
closest
to
dunaway
in
the
scheme
of
cases
that
this
court
has
adjudicated
in
recent
years.
it
is
closer
to
dunaway
and
different
than
most
of
the
others.
for
example,
this
case
is
atypical
to
the
airport
cases.
it
is
not
like
mendenhall,
reid,
royer,
place,
or
rodriguez,
for
a
whole
bunch
of
reasons
that
are
obvious.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
yes.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
the
only
abnormal
turn,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
the
turn
through
the
campground.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
if
you
look
at
the
record,
and
you
look
at
that
on
a
map,
which
i
believe
is
actually
in
the
record,
you
see
that
there
wasn't
any
weaving
or
erratic
type
of
turn.
it
was
a
simple
turn
through
the
campground.
i
believe
they
actually
stopped
at
a
stop
sign,
both
vehicles,
and
then
when
they
came
out
to
the
other
side
of
the
campground,
they
turned
back
on
the
main
highway.
it
wasn't
necessarily,
i
think,
viewed
as
erratic
or
evasive,
and
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that,
and
the
fourth
circuit
didn't
quite
view
it
that
way.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
i
think
i
would
have
to
concede
the
aggregate
of
the
observations
or
what
the
officer
should
look
at.
i
don't
think,
however,
that
necessarily
coming
from
this
area
of
north
carolina
which
the
record
reflects
is
a
heavy
camping
vacation
area,
that
an
overloaded
camper
with
covered
windows
is
necessarily
the
signs
of
a
vehicle
transporting
drugs.
i
mean,
you
have
to
go
some
to
reach
that
conclusion,
and
that
is
what
the
circuit
court
felt,
but
i
would
agree
that
certainly
all
of
the
circumstances
need
to
be
looked
at
before
you
can--
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
--yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
i
couldn't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
yes.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
i
would
say
that
was
a
fair--
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
--i
am
not
as
much
debating
here
the
articulable
suspicion,
although
i
think
it
is
extremely
weak.
i
think
it
is
extremely
weak
compared
to
other
cases,
but
the
circuit
has
assumed
that,
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
their
opinion.
what
i
was
focusing
on
just
a
minute
ago,
if
the
court
permits
me
to
get
back
to
it,
is
that
in
the
airport
searches,
you
just
have
an
area
unto
itself.
in
the
original
terry
trilogy
of
terry,
adams,
and
brignoni-ponce,
followed
later
by
brown
versus
illinois
and
collander
versus
rawson,
you
have
these
situation
of
the
patdown,
the
frisk,
the
brignoni-ponce
momentary
stop
of
an
automobile,
like
cortez,
these
are
clearly
the
purest
terry
type
of
cases.
then
you
have
the
automobile
cases,
the
other
automobile
cases
like
mimms
and
delaware
versus
crowse,
which
are
traffic
cases,
clearly
related
to
either
the
random
traffic
stop
in
crowse,
and
mimms,
the
legitimate
traffic
stop
followed
by
come
out
of
the
car,
patdown,
but
clearly
brief
terry
situations.
now,
none
of
these
cases
that
i
am
talking
about
except
for
the
airport
cases
are
cases
where
detentions
have
lasted
more
than
a
few
minutes,
none
of
them.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
well,
it
is
hard
to
say
what...
the
time
that
took
place
in
terry
versus
ohio,
i
think,
for
example,
just
being
actually
that,
a
few
minutes,
two,
three,
four
minutes
for
the
patdown.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what
the
time
was
in
that
case.
i
don't
know
in
michigan
versus
long.
i
know
that
the
time
was
extended
somewhat
in
the
airport
cases.
for
example,
in
place,
i
believe
we
had
a
90-minute
detention
of
the
luggage.
that
was
the
outside
limit
that
i
think
the
court
has
gone.
this
case...
and
of
course
the
distinction
i
would
make
there
is,
we
are
dealing
there
with
things,
luggage.
here
we
are
dealing
with
persons.
there
we
are
dealing
with
expectations
of
privacy
which
are
to
some
extent
in
an
airport
minimized.
everybody
subjects
themselves
to
searches
in
airports.
we
all
know
that.
but
on
a
highway,
in
your
own
car,
that
is
not
necessarily
the
case,
although
in
the
automobile
cases
of
this
court
there
is
perhaps
a
little
wider
breadth
to
what
an
individual
subjects
himself
to.
but
by
and
large,
we
then
go
to
cortez,
the
chevron
shoe
case,
which
is
a
quick
case,
and
brignoni-ponce,
as
i
said,
which
is
a
quick
case.
there
is
an
aberration
kind
of
in
that
van
leuwen
case,
which
is
the
29-hour
coin,
counterfeit
coin
case,
which
involves
the
postal
authorities
and
really
doesn't
bear
any
analogy
to
what
we
have
here.
i
think...
and
in
michigan
versus
summers,
justice
stevens,
i
believe,
as
i
read
the
case,
tied
the
ruling
there
more
to
the...
and
the
lengthy
detention
to
the
execution
of
a
warrant
in
the
man's
home
and
gave
reasons
that
to
me
made
a
lot
of
sense
to
justify
the
lengthy
detention
there
being
tied
to
warrant
under
the
protection
of
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
what
do
we
have
here?
here
we
just
seem
to
have
a
dunaway.
these
two
men
are
taken
to
the
side
of
the
roadway.
neither
of
them
is
informed
what
the
whole
thing
is
about.
when
savage
is
taken
out
by
thrasher,
he
just
simply
arrests
him.
he
takes
him,
he
puts
him
up
against
the
van,
spread-eagled,
at
gunpoint.
mr.
frey
didn't
mention
that.
at
gunpoint.
takes
his
license
away,
his
registration
away,
and
keeps
it,
and
holds
him
there.
he
holsters
the
gun
at
that
point
when
he
sees
he
is
unarmed.
that
is
an
arrest.
that
is
not
a
terry
stop.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
no,
they,
i
am
sure,
knew
why
they
were
stopped,
but
as
i
read
it
the
terry
cases
and
the
progeny
are
talking
about
the
objective
view
of
the
officer...
not
of
the
officer,
the
objective
view
that
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
under
the
situation,
not
the
accused,
so
that
i
believe
that
that
is
the
test
of
the
court,
and
i
believe
that
would
be
the
answer
to
your
question.
so
that
what
i
am
concerned
about
is
that
if
savage
is
apparently
under
arrest
at
gunpoint
and
says,
you
cannot
leave,
that
mr.
justice
brennan
found
out
in
answer
to
his
questions
before,
then
you
have
sharpe,
who
is
clearly
under
arrest.
what
better
indicia
do
you
have
of
arrest
than
being
put--
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
--yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
well,
except
that...
except
that
these
people
here...
i
should
have
used
the
term
"de
facto
arrest",
because
i
think
that
is
the
progression
that
you
see
in
dunaway
versus
new
york.
when
sharpe
and
savage
are
held
as
i
have
described
it
to
you,
which
i
think
is
a
candid
statement
of
what
the
record
says,
at
that
point
cooke
in
effect
arrested
them
before
he
smelled
the
marijuana.
they
were
clearly
in
a
de
facto
arrest
situation,
but
the
level--
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
--well,
i
am
not
sure.
the
fourth
circuit
uses
that
word.
i
have
used
it.
but
here
is
what
i
think
it
means,
and
it
is
like
levels,
levels
that
justice
stevens
was
talking
about
before.
you
can
go
to
a
level
first
of
a
seizure,
a
momentary
seizure.
then
you
can
go
to
the
level
where
the
man
is
held
at
gunpoint
and
cannot
move,
or
locked
in...
or
put
in
the
back
of
a
police
car
where
he
cannot
leave.
at
that
point
you
are
at
a
probable
cause
level.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
sir.
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
the
situation.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
no,
i
am
not
saying
he
is
free
to
evade
it,
but
there
has
to
be
a
justification,
a
reasonable
justification
to
keep
him
for
that
period
of
time.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
but
perhaps
in
this
case,
as
mr....
i
mean,
as
justice
white
has
suggested,
perhaps
they
didn't
use
their
time
wisely.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
that's
right,
per
se
inconsistent.
and
that
it
is
an
indicia
that
a
probable
cause
standard
has
arisen,
has
been
injected
by
the
officers
into
the
case,
and
that
at
that
point
they
had
no
probable
cause.
the
government
concedes,
the
government
concedes
in
this
case
that
the
probable
cause
did
not
occur
until
the
olfactory
actions
of
cooke
with
the
marijuana.
therefore,
my
position
is,
following
the
dunaway
analogy,
that
a
probable
cause
situation
clearly
developed
with
sharpe
and
clearly
developed
with
savage
as
i
have
described.
alternatively,
the
degree
of
the
intrusion
reached
a
level
which
is
inconsistent
with
terry
if
you
look
at
the
case
as
a
non-dunaway
but
a
terry
case.
the
intrusion
had
reached
a
level
where
it
became
so
offensive
to
both
sharpe
and
savage
that
they
had
their
fourth
amendments
rights
interfered
with.
i
want
to
say
one
thing--
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
--oh,
yes,
and
i
thank
your
honor
for
the
suggestion.
clearly
where
the
individuals
who
are
being
detained
into
those
minutes
beyond
brief
minutes
that
have
been
viewed
over
and
over
again
by
this
court
in
terms
of
a
few
minutes...
brevity,
momentary,
these
are
the
words
from
your
cases...
where
an
individual
says,
i
want
to
go,
then
the
level
of
the
fourth
amendment
violation
increases
dramatically
because
he
has
said,
i
do
not
want
to
be
seized.
i
want
to
be
free.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
well,
as
i
said,
in
reading
mendenhall
and
reading
royer,
i
view
the
airport
cases
and
the
context
in
which
they
all
arise,
which
is
almost
identical,
as
just
having
a
special
place
in
this
court,
and
i
think
the
plurality
decisions
in
royer
and
place...
i
think
i
have
that
right...
show
that
the
court
itself
has
not
fully
determined
in
which
direction
the
airport
cases
are
finally
going
to
go.
i
think
that
perhaps
those
cases
are
going
to
end
up
as
a
special
area
in
and
of
themselves,
because...
and
i
say
that
because
of
the
number...
there
are
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
cases
that
have
been
considered
by
the
court
since
1980
dealing
with
airport
searches.
can
i
talk
about
the
fugitivity
of
my
past
clients
for
just
a
moment,
please?
i
do
feel,
although
i
didn't
sound
like
a
non-adversary
probably...
it
is
in
my
blood...
but
i
do
feel
that
for
the
court
to
decide
the
issue
before
it,
which
i
view
as
very,
very
critical
issues,
in
the
context
of
a
case
involving
the
fugitivity
of
my
clients,
is
somewhat
of
a
disadvantage
to
them
for
the
reasons
that
justice
marshall
and
justice
stevens
have
stated.
it
is
not
that
i
don't
feel
that--
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
--right.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
justice
o'connor,
what
can
i
say?
the
equities
are
not
with
me
in
that
argument,
and
i
know
that.
put
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
is
going
to
make
constitutional
law
in
the
critical
area
of
the
fourth
amendment,
particularly
as
argued
by
mr.
frey,
which
if
his
argument
is
adopted
by
the
court
will
lead
to
a
somewhat
major
expansion
of
the
terry
doctrine.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
well,
i
don't
know
that
they
are...
i
don't
know
that
they
are
disadvantaged.
maybe
they
neither
win
nor
they
lose.
it
just
seems
to
me
as
a
lawyer
who...
more
as
a
trial
lawyer
than
a
constitutional
lawyer,
that
the
court
should
direct
major
constitutional
decisions
to
cases
where
there
are
real
persons
and
defendants
before
it.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
i
know
that.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
well,
as
i
said--
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
--well,
i
do
feel
good
about--
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
--i
do
feel
good
about
my
case,
but
you
know,
sometimes...
sometimes
winning
is
not
what
it
is
all
about
exactly.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
i
understand
that,
and
if
they
lose,
they
lose
in
one
way,
and
i
guess
perhaps
down
the
line
maybe
they...
in
my
own
way
they
would
win
in
another.
i
don't
know.
but
i
just
feel,
as
justice
marshall
does,
that
there
is
a
problem.
mr.
mark
j.
kadish
that's
right.
i
guess
in
today's
world,
at
least
from
where
i
am
sitting,
most
of
them
get
caught
one
way
or
the
other.
thank
you
very
much.
