when
you
say
a
few
minutes,
do
you
have
any
particular
amount
of
minutes
in
mind?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
michigan
against
long?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kadish?
justice
rehnquist
you
use
the
term
"under
arrest"
or
"at
gunpoint"
as
if
those
were
somehow
inconsistent
with
a
terry
stop.
my
understanding
of
a
terry
stop
is
that
it
differs
from
an
arrest
in
its
duration
and
its
purpose,
but
i
would
think
that
the
custody
which
a
person
is
in
under
a
terry
stop
is
just
as
complete
as
in
an
arrest.
justice
rehnquist
what
is
a
de
facto
arrest?
justice
rehnquist
supposing
i
try
to
make
a
terry
stop
on
reasonable
suspicion
and
the
person
whom
i
am
trying
to
stop
simply
tries
to
flee.
am
i
not
entitled
to
draw
a
gun
or
use
what
force
seems
to
be
necessary
to
bring
him
into
custody?
justice
rehnquist
you
suggested
that
the
custody
involved
in
a
terry
stop
is
kind
of
a
loose,
floating
thing
that
if
the
defendant
wants
to
evade
it
he
is
free
to
evade
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
supposing
there
is
a
reasonable
justification.
isn't
the
law
enforcement
officer
entitled
to
use
reasonable
means
to
keep
him
for
that
length
of
time?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i
am
not
interested
right
now
in
whether
they
used
their
time
wisely.
is
it
part
of
your
argument
that
the
showing
of
a
gun
or
the
spread
eagle
search
is
per
se
inconsistent
with
a
terry
stop?
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
mendenhall
and
with
the
combination
of
opinions
in
florida
against
royer
which
adopted
justice
stewart's
test
in
mendenhall
that
there
is
not
even
a
seizure
if
the
defendant
objectively
feels
he
is
free
to
leave?
