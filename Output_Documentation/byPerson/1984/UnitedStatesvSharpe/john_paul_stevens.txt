justice
stevens
mr.
frey,
could
i
ask
at
this
point,
is
the
analysis
the
same
with
respect
to
mr.
sharpe
as
it
is
with
respect
to
mr.
savage?
he
was
back
in
a
different
location,
wasn't
he?
justice
stevens
except
that
he
was
by
the
side
of
the
road
with
an
officer
telling
him
he
couldn't
go
any
place.
that
is
not
quite
the
same
as
being
at
home.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
your
main
position
with
respect
to
sharpe
is,
he
doesn't
really
have
standing
to
object.
is
that--
justice
stevens
--really
what
i
am
trying
to
ask,
i
am
trying
to
follow
up
on
what
justice
brennan
asked
you.
is
the
timing
any
different?
could
you
have
held...
you
say
you
would
get
a
point
with
respect
to
savage
when
perhaps
it
would
have
been
too
long
if
they
hadn't
ripened
into
probable
cause.
how
long
could
they
have
detained
sharpe?
the
same
length
of
time?
justice
stevens
they
could
detain
sharpe
because
they
had
reasonable
suspicion
about
savage?
justice
stevens
that
they
might
be
connected.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the...
you
mentioned
in
your
description
of
the
case
that
they
apparently
were
speeding
when
they
went
in
and
out
of
the
camp
site
or
whatever,
the
pull-off
part,
and
also
that
the
camper
in
effect
sort
of
sped
away
when
he
pulled
the
car
over.
justice
stevens
do
you
rely
on
those
two
circumstances
merely
as
buttressing
your
showing
of
probable
smuggling
activity,
or
do
you
rely
on
them
in
part
as
violations
of
law?
justice
stevens
--i
take
it
you
also
are
not
really
relying
on
the
pulling
away
of
the
van
at
the
time
they...
they
had
already
decided
to
stop
them.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
activity
made
it
reasonable
to
detain
them
for
a
little
longer
than
if
he
had
not
pulled
away
as--
justice
stevens
--so
there
is
kind
of
reasonable
suspicion
enough
to
stop
them,
and
then
a
little
more
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
15
minutes--
justice
stevens
--there
are
two
levels
of
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
stevens
i
see.
sort
of
like
an
exigent
circumstance
that
made
it
necessary.
justice
stevens
your
position
basically
is,
heads
you
win,
tails
they
lose.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
if
your
position
is
right,
the
third
alternative
in
your
reply
brief,
what
motivation
would
the
other
side
have
to
really
fight
the
case
as
a
true
adversary,
you
know,
all
the
problems
that
are
involved
in
cases--
justice
stevens
--but
do
you
think
that
is
an
appropriate
case
for
us
to
decide
constitutional
issues
in--
justice
stevens
--when
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
that
you
can
lose?
justice
stevens
well,
i
think
you
make
a
very
persuasive
argument
that...
at
least
alternate
two,
that
if
they
are
fugitives,
they
forfeit
their
right
to
have
the
benefit
of
any
judgment.
once
they
have
forfeited
that
right,
they
are
not
the
kind
of
adversary
i
normally
like
to
have
arguing
constitutional
questions.
that
is
my
problem.
i
understand
that
there
are
precedents
of
the
court
that
support
your
view,
but
isn't
there
at
least
some
argument
to
the
contrary?
justice
stevens
that
was
not
a
fugitive
involved,
though.
justice
stevens
and
the
litigant
himself...
i
mean,
you
have
to
look
not
only
at
the
lawyer,
but
the
litigant
himself
here
has
no
interest
in
the...
if
we
agree
with
you
on
molinaro,
the
litigant
himself
has
no
interest
in
what
happens
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
well,
i
realize
that,
and
that
is
one
of
the
unfortunate
things
about
the
courts.
and
villamonte-marquez.
justice
stevens
well,
mr.
frey,
supposing
that
the
camper
was
following...
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
vehicle
the
other
one
was,
a
white
chevrolet
or
something,
and
the
man,
the
agent
was
by
himself.
he
pulled
the
camper
over
and
the
other
car
sped
off.
they
didn't
both
stop.
and
he
happened
to
be
alone.
could
he
have
called
the
state
police
and
said,
stop
a
green
chevrolet
or
whatever
it
might
be,
and
say
there
are
four
green
chevrolets
in
the
next
five
miles,
could
they
stop
them
all?
justice
stevens
just
a
green
chevrolet?
justice
stevens
well,
you
would
have
to
be
sure
it
is--
justice
stevens
--take
a
blue
honda
then.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
stevens
i
suppose
we've
got
to
catch
them.
no
matter
how
we
decide
it,
they
have
got
to
be
caught
before
anybody
wins
or
loses
here.
