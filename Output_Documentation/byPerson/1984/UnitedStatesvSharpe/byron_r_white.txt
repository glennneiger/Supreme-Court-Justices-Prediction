justice
white
well,
mr.
frey,
what
do
you
do
about
this?
had
there
been
two
agents
who
were
qualified
to
act
as
drug
investigators,
the
detention
wouldn't
have...
even
though
the
man
sped
away,
if
the
agent
following
him
hadn't
been
a
trooper
but
a
drug
agent--
justice
white
--what
is
the
excuse
for
having
people
conduct
drug
investigations
who
aren't
qualified?
i
am
just
asking
you
whether
there
is
a--
justice
white
--whether
there
was
a
less
intrusive
alternative.
justice
white
well,
whether
it
was
planned
or
not,
i
would
suppose
that
experience
would
indicate
that
you
might
need
two
agents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
soon
as
they
decided
to
stop
one
car
they
called
for
help.
justice
white
nevertheless,
if
there
had
been
two
qualified
agents,
this
case
wouldn't
be
here
probably.
justice
white
why?
justice
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
single
agent
is
patrolling,
i
suppose
he
is
out
there
to
do
something
like
making
a
stop
if
he
has
got
reasonable
suspicion.
now,
just
as
soon
as
he
decided
to
stop,
he
called
for
help.
justice
white
i
thought
that...
is
it
unreasonable
to
suggest
that
the
government
ought
to
have...
they
ought
to
travel
in
pairs
or
not?
justice
white
or
like
in
place,
they
should
have
had
one
at
every
airport?
justice
white
well,
they
just
take
their
risk,
though,
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
white
well,
you
anticipate
making
arrests,
and
as
soon
as
you
decide
to
make
a
stop,
you
call
for
another
agent.
justice
white
the
concern
in
terry
kind
of
stops
is
to
don't
do
anything
more
than
you
really
have
to.
justice
white
well,
mr.
kadish,
if
we
agree
with
you,
i
suppose
you
know
we
would
vacate
the
judgment
below.
justice
white
and
leave
your
clients
in
the
soup.
justice
white
if
you
really
feel
good
about
your
case,
why
don't
you
want
us
to
decide
it?
justice
white
you
may
win.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
losing...
if
you
win,
your
clients
lose.
if
you
win
on
this
present
argument,
your
clients
lose?
justice
white
mr.
frey,
do
you
have
any
courts
of
appeals
decisions
in
your
favor
on
this?
justice
white
how
about
state
courts?
justice
white
you
don't...
on
these
facts,
you
don't.
you
are
relying
on
an
analysis
or
an
approach.
justice
white
that
same
approach,
though,
wouldn't
justify
two
or
three
hours,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
white
i
don't
know
why
not?
justice
white
couldn't
you
argue
that
the
officer
could
say,
well,
if
you
want
to
leave,
go
ahead,
but
i
am
keeping
your
truck?
that
is
what
they
do
in
the
airport
cases.
you
seize
the
luggage.
if
the
fellow
wants
to
go
on
to
boston,
let
him
go.
justice
white
couldn't
you
argue
that
discovery
of
the
marijuana
was
a
fruit
of
the
seizure
of
the
truck,
not
the
person?
