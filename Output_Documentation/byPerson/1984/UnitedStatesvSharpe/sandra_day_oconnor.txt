justice
o'connor
mr.
frey,
i
want
to
ask
about
this
point
if
i
may.
you
say
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
to
make
the
initial
stop.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
would
it
be
remanded
for
that
purpose
then,
since
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
it?
justice
o'connor
would
we
have
enough
before
us
in
the
record
to
determine
the
reasonable
suspicion
issue
as
it
stands?
justice
o'connor
of
a
narcotics...
transportation
of
illegal
drugs?
justice
o'connor
and
so
in
responding
to
justice
stevens,
you
are
not
asking
the
court
to
rely
on
the
speeding
violation
as--
justice
o'connor
well,
your
clients...
your
clients
certainly
opted
to
leave
knowing
they
had
no
right
to
do
so.
justice
o'connor
and
i
just
wonder
whether
they
have
a
very
good
argument
for
saying
the
court
shouldn't
deal
with
the
issues
that
they
were
aware
could
be
raised
and
were
raised.
