justice
marshall
you
mean
there
is
no
difference
between
amicus
curiae
and
respondent?
justice
marshall
that
wasn't
my
question.
there
is
a
difference.
justice
marshall
well,
it
is
not
a
normal
adversarial
proceeding,
is
it?
justice
marshall
there
is
also
a
difference
between
a
divorce
and
going
to
jail,
believe
it
or
not.
justice
marshall
of
course,
they
didn't
bring
this
case.
you
did,
didn't
you?
justice
marshall
the
government
locks
over
a
whole
list
of
cases,
and
finds
the
one
that
the
man
is
gone
and
doesn't
have
any
lawyer.
justice
marshall
and
won't
there
be
another
case
just
like
this?
justice
marshall
right
down
by
myrtle
beach
there
will
be
another
one.
justice
marshall
when
two
cars
travel
together,
one
behind
the
other,
and
make
a
complete
circle,
they
are
not
together?
justice
marshall
counsel,
getting
back
to
going
around
the
circle--
justice
marshall
--do
you
agree
that
the
best
way
to
find
out
whether
you
are
being
followed
is
to
make
four
right
turns?
justice
marshall
so
when
you
make
a
circle
it
is
the
same
thing.
justice
marshall
so
once
they
made
the
circle,
they
knew
they
were
being
followed.
justice
marshall
and
that's
the
time
that
any
police
officer
knows
that
he
has
to
make
an
arrest.
