mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
suppressing
a
truckload
of
marijuana
seized
from
the
respondents
on
the
ground
that
the
discovery
of
the
marijuana
was
the
fruit
of
an
unduly
prolonged
detention.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
was
a...
this
was
a
pickup
truck
with
a
camper
shell.
it
was
43
bales
of
marijuana
weighing,
i
think,
about
2,600
pounds.
that
is
a
fair
quantity.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
case
began
when
there
was
an
operation
to
investigate
suspected
smuggling,
marijuana
smuggling
in
the...
it
was
believed
to
be
occurring
either
in
the
northernmost
coastal
county
of
south
carolina
or
the
southernmost
coastal
county
of
north
carolina.
and
the
main
actor
on
the
law
enforcement
side
was
dea
agent
cooke,
who
was
patrolling
the
highways
near
the
beaches
where
the
marijuana
activity
was
suspected
to
be
occurring,
and
he
saw
the
pickup
truck
with
camper
shell,
which
turned
out
to
be
driven
by
respondent
savage,
proceeding
in
tandem
with
a
pontiac
automobile,
which
turned
out
to
be
driven
by
respondent
sharpe.
being
suspicious
of
these
vehicles,
he
followed
them
for
some
20
miles
as
they
proceeded
south
and
observed
certain
things
about
them
which
to
his
mind
confirmed
his
suspicion
that
they
might
be
engaged
in
marijuana
smuggling.
he
determined
at
that
point
that
he
might
like
to
make
a
stop,
and
he
radioed
for
assistance,
and
patrolman
thrasher
of
the
south
carolina
state
police
joined
this
procession
of
vehicles
as
it
proceeded
toward
myrtle
beach,
and
shortly
after
thrasher
joined
the
procession,
the
pickup
truck
and
the
car
made
a
turn
onto
a
camp
road,
sped
along
that
road
well
in
excess
of
the
speed
limit.
the
road
made
a
loop
and
returned
to
the
main
highway.
they
were
followed
all
this
time
by
agent
cooke
and
patrolman
thrasher.
they
turned
back
on
the
main
highway
headed
south.
at
that
point
it
was
decided
by
agent
cooke
that
they
should
be
stopped
for
investigation.
he
asked
thrasher
to
signal
them
to
halt.
thrasher
did
so.
when
he
did
so,
the
pontiac
automobile
driven
by
sharpe
pulled
over
to
the
side.
the
truck
driven
by
respondent
savage
sped
off
in
between
the
patrolman's
car
and
the
pontiac
down
the
road.
at
this
point,
patrolman
thrasher
followed
the
truck
down
the
road
and
agent
cooke
stopped
with
the
pontiac.
he
asked
sharpe
for
identification.
sharpe
produced
a
license
in
the
name
of
raymond
j.
pavlovich.
cooke
made
some
further
efforts
to
communicate
with
thrasher
which
were
initially
unsuccessful.
at
the
same
time,
he
called
for
backup
units
from
the
myrtle
beach
police
to
come
and
hold
sharpe
and
his
passenger
while
he
went
on
to
see
if
he
could
locate
the
truck.
he
went
down
the
road,
caught
up
half
a
mile
down
the
road
with
patrolman
thrasher
and
the
truck,
and
in
the
meanwhile,
to
come
back
to
that
stopping,
thrasher
had
pursued
the
truck,
stopped
it
half
a
mile
down
the
road.
savage
had
been
ordered
out
of
the
vehicle
or
had
been
coming
out
of
the
vehicle.
it
is
not
quite
clear.
he
was
frisked.
he
was
then
asked
for
license
and
registration.
he
produced
a
bill
of
sale
in
the
name
also
of
raymond
j.
pavlovich,
and
at
that
point
he
was
simply
held
by
agent
thrasher...
by
officer
thrasher
until
agent
cooke
appeared
on
the
scene.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
did
ask
if
he
could
leave.
there
is
no
question--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--he
wasn't
allowed
to
leave
because
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
truck
contained
marijuana.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
at
that
time.
that
was
the
basis
for
the
stop.
the
basis
for
the
stop
was
agent
cooke's
suspicion
of
marijuana
smuggling
activity,
which
focused
on
the
truck
as--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--he
was
not
allowed
to
leave
because
agent
thrasher
had
determined
to
hold
him
until
cooke
arrived
on
the
scene
to
conduct
a--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
do
intend
to
get
into
that.
i
think
there
is
precedent
of
yours
in
terms
of
analysis
and
language
in
opinions
that
clearly
justifies
that.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
holding
that
is
directly
on
point.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
this
detention
was
from
the
time
he
was
stopped--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
he
was
already
being
detained
at
the
time
he
was
pulled
over
to
the
side
of
the
road,
so
to
my
mind
the
fact
that
he
asked
to
leave
is
irrelevant.
he
was
already
under...
his
person
had
already
been
seized
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
even
before
he
asked
to
leave.
it
is
not
clear
when
he
asked
to
leave.
i
am
not
certain
when
that
is,
but
from
the
beginning
initiation--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
no,
our
suggestion
is
that
what
there
was
in
this
case
was
a
seizure
at
the
time
he
was
pulled
over
by
officer
thrasher,
supported
by
reasonable
suspicion,
which
extended
for
approximately,
and
the
record
is
not
totally
clear,
about
20
minutes
until
agent
cooke
arrived.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
would
have
to
know
why
it
was
an
hour,
but
ordinarily--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
we
would
still
defend
that
as
being
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
there
is
clearly
an
outer
limit,
because
you
would
have
to
ask
yourself
whether
it
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
to
take
some
other
means.
the
reason
why
the
detention
was
extended
in
this
case
was
quite
clearly
because
officer
thrasher
didn't
know...
he
was
acting
as
agent
for
cooke
in
making
the
stop.
he
knew
nothing
about
the
investigation,
what
cooke
had
observed,
what
the
joint
task
force
that
was
investigating
the
smuggling
activity
knew.
he
didn't
know
really
what
questions
to
ask
or
what
things
to
do.
once
agent
cooke
arrived
on
the
scene,
it
was
a
matter
of
about
five
minutes
for
him
to
ask
a
couple
of
questions,
seek
and
be
denied
consent
to
search
the
camper.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
say
that
as
to
respondent
sharpe,
there
is
no...
he
might
as
well
have
been
sitting
at
home
in
kansas
city
in
terms
of
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
possible,
although
we
contend
it
is
not
true,
that
sharpe
was
unlawfully
detained.
however,
the
evidence
in
question
in
this
case
is
the
marijuana
seized
from
savage's
camper.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
whether
sharpe
had...
sharpe
could
have
been
arrested
without
probable
cause.
he
could
have
been--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
is
that
he
doesn't
have
standing,
but
really
standing
and
fruits
are
intertwined
in
this
case.
that
is
that
nothing
was
the
product
of
the
detention
of
sharpe
except
for
the
discovery
of
the
license
which
occurred
immediately
when--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it
would
be
essentially
the
same
length
of
time
that
they
could
detain
either
of
them.
the
detention
of
sharpe
was
longer
from
the
time
that
he
was--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--and
about
sharpe.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
sharpe
and
savage
were
clearly
together.
so
there
are
two
separate
questions.
one
is
whether
sharpe
was
unlawfully
detained,
and
my
point
in
this
connection
is
that
what
you
must
focus
on,
because
what
is
at
issue
is
the
admissibility
of
the
marijuana
seized
from
the
camper,
is
only
the
detention
from
the
time
the
camper
was
stopped
until
the
time
probable
cause
to
believe
it
contained
marijuana
developed
is
the
relevant
period
of
time.
now,
for
mr.
sharpe,
he
was
detained
longer,
but
in
our
view,
that
detention
was
not
unlawful,
a,
because
it
was
justified
by
the
circumstances,
certainly
the
last
ten
minutes
or
so
of
it
were
after
probable
cause
had
already
developed,
and
in
any
event,
whether
a
lawful
or
unlawful,
irrelevant
to
the
admissibility
of
the
marijuana.
sharpe
could
have
been
detained
for
ten
hours.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
finding
the
marijuana.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
with
respect
to
the
speeding,
i
rely
on
it
only
insofar
as
an
issue
which
is
not
before
the
court,
which
is
the
validity
of
the
initial
stop,
which
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
pass
on.
i
think
the
initial
stop
would
be
justified
by
the
speeding.
i
do
not
rely
on
the
extended
detention
on
the
basis
of
the
speeding,
because
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
speeding
would
have
led
to
a
custodial
arrest
or
would
ordinarily
have
led
to
an
extended
detention.
so,
the
extended
detention
we
seek
to
justify
only
by
the
suspicion
of
marijuana
smuggling.
now,
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
believe
that's
correct.
i
think
you
could
decide
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
leaving
aside
the
question
of
respondents'
fugitivity,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
this
court
either
to
go
ahead
and
decide
it
if
it
chose
to
or
to
remand
it.
for
instance,
in
united
states
against
hasting,
where
the
issue
was
harmless
error,
there
was
a
question,
a,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
obliged
to
consider
harmless
error,
and
b,
whether
if
it
was
obliged
to
consider
it
the
error
was
harmless.
and
this
court
chose
to
rule--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
we
think
there
quite
clearly
was
enough
to
amount
to
a
reasonable
suspicion--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
we
think
so.
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
because...
i
think
the
speeding
violation
would
justify
the
initial
stop,
but
i
don't
think
that
carries
the
day
for
us
because
the
problem
here
is
the
validity
of
detaining
savage
for
15
or
20
minutes
while
cooke
was
able
to
arrive
on
the
scene
and
conduct
his
investigation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
true.
we
are
not
relying
on
it
to
justify
the
stop,
because
the
siren
already
had
been
turned
on,
if
they
didn't
have
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
definitely.
and--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
is
not
just
that
it
adds
to
the
increment
of
suspicion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
that
it
necessitates
the
extended
detention,
which
otherwise
would
not
have
been
necessary.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
part
of
the
question
is
whether
it
was
justified
to
detain
respondent
savage
for
15
or
20
minutes
until
cooke
conducted
his
investigation,
and
we
are
saying
that
the
fact
that
savage
sped
off
down
the
road,
almost
running
into
thrasher's
police
car,
and
was
only
apprehended
a
half
a
mile
away,
separate,
and
there
are
only
two
police
officers
involved
in
the
investigation,
so
if
they
wanted
to
investigate
both
of
these
individuals,
one
had
to
stop
with
one,
the
other
had
to
pursue
the
other.
and
as
it
turned
out,
quite
reasonably,
thrasher
had
the
equipment,
pursued
the
vehicle
that
was
trying
to
flee,
and
agent
cooke
stopped
with
the
vehicle
that
had
pulled
over.
now,
i
think
this
case
poses
as
its
primary
issue,
stated
most
broadly,
whether
the
fourth
amendment
generally
prohibits
the
prolongation
of
a
stop
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
short
of
probable
cause
for
more
than
a
few
minutes.
and
if
the
fourth
amendment
does
sometimes
permit
such
extended
detentions,
the
narrower
question
is
whether
the
circumstances
of
this
case
were
such
as
to
justify
the
detentions
here.
now,
in
addition,
because
the
respondents
are
fugitives,
the
court
may
also
deem
it
necessary
to
consider
the
effect
that
that
has
on
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case.
we
have
addressed
it
in
our
reply
brief,
and
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions
that
the
court
may
have.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it's
the
same
essentially
as
their
position.
that
is,
their
position
is,
if
they
win
the
case,
maybe
they
will
show
up
again,
and
if
they
lose
the
case,
then
they
won't.
so
it
is
true
in
a
sense
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
the
other
side
is
not
a
true
adversary.
the
court
declined
to
appoint
mr.
kadish
to
represent
the
respondents,
i
assume
precisely
because
they
were
fugitives.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
have
no
doubt
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
when
you
say
that
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
that
we
can
lose,
it
is
as
though
we
were
here
arguing
about
a
constitutional
question
as
in
milton
against
wainwright,
which
may
in
the
end
turn
out
to
be
harmless
error.
there
may
be
no
way
in
the
world
we
can
lose
because
an
error
is
harmless.
in
united
states
against
leon
the
argument
was
made
that
if
you
had
a
reasonable
mistake
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
then
that
would
freeze
the
development
of
fourth
amendment
law,
because
you
would
always
know
when
you
had
a
new
fourth
amendment
issue
that
the
government
in
the
end
was
going
to
win
on
the
suppression
motion,
and
yet
this
court
said
there
is
nothing
in
the
court's
jurisprudence
that
makes
it
inappropriate
to
first
consider
the
merits,
and
then
if
it
is
necessary
and
appropriate
to
do
so,
turn
to
the
question
of
remedy.
no
question
that
we
have
a
full
adversarial
presentation.
i
expect
mr.
kadish
to
be
every
bit
as
vigorous
today
as
if
he
were
here
representing
sharpe
and
savage--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
is
frequent
in
this
court's
past
jurisprudence
that
there
has
not
been--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
is
a
difference,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
a
difference
that
deprives
this
case
of
its
adversarial--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
is
not
a
normal
one,
but
it
is
one
that
is
far
from
unknown
to
this
court.
going
back...
the
first
case
that
i
am
aware
of,
although
i
am
sure
it
happened
before,
was
a
case
called
granville
smith,
which
involved
the
validity
of
a
virgin
islands
divorce
law
where
both
parties
took
the
position
that
the
law
was
valid
and
that
the
divorce
they
had
was
good,
and
the
court
appointed
an
amicus
to
defend
the
judgment--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
the
problem
of...
the
molinaro
principle
seems
to
me
quite
clearly
to
suggest
that
as
far
as
the
going
to
jail
aspect
of
this
case
is
concerned,
respondents,
by
taking
it
upon
themselves
to
become
fugitives,
are
going
to
end
up
going
to
jail.
i
don't
understand...
that
seems
to
me
the
rock
bottom
principle,
that
is,
that
the
court
will
not
allow
a
party
to
place
itself
beyond
the
reach
of
the
court's
judgment,
and
if
the
court's
judgment
is
unfavorable,
not
to
be
subject--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--they
were
on
bail.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
were
on
bail.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
bail
has
been
forfeited.
a
bench
warrant
has
been
issued
for
their
arrest.
there
are
also
other
charges
at
least
against
sharpe
in
other
jurisdictions
from
which
he
is
also
a
fugitive.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
one
point
that
is
clear,
and
we
analogize
this
in
our
brief
to
the
situation
in
walder
and
havens,
because
this
is
a
claim
for
suppression
of
evidence
under
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule.
this
is
not
a
claim
that
these
defendants
are
innocent,
which
might
cause
a
different
set
of
concerns.
so
that
if
you
view
it
as
a
matter
of
exclusionary
rule
policy,
you
must
ask
yourself
the
question
whether
these
defendants
are
entitled
to
a
favorable
judgment
reversing
their
conviction
on
the
grounds
of
an
illegal
search
or
seizure
when
they
are
not
willing
to
submit
to
an
unfavorable
judgment
should
the
court
render
one.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
the
haslip
case
last
term
you
had
to
appoint
someone
who
was
an
amicus
to
defend
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
did
not
involve
a
fugitive,
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
precisely
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
exclusionary
rule
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
that
was
a
little
bit
different,
because
there
the
claim
was
that
the
case
was
moot,
or
that
we
somehow
had
lost
the
right
to
pursue
our
case
by
deporting
them,
but
the
respondents
had
done
nothing
wrong
other
than
their
drug
smuggling.
that
is,
their
departure
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
was
not
their
fault,
whereas
here
it
is
clearly
their
fault.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
certainly
did
bring
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
when
we
petitioned,
they
were
not
fugitives,
and
when
the
court
granted
this
petition
we
were
still
unaware,
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
savage
was
a
fugitive.
it
was
only
after
the
court
granted
the
petition
that
savage
was
declared
a
fugitive,
and
it
was
only
in
august,
after
we
filed
our
opening
brief
in
august
of
this
year,
that
we
learned
that
both
respondents
were
fugitives.
and
i
must
say
that
the
court
has
in
the
past
always
been
satisfied...
if
you
are
not
satisfied
that
you
have
an
adequate
adversarial
presentation,
if
you
are
not
satisfied
that
you
have
an
adequate
basis
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
fourth
amendment
issue
in
this
case,
then
by
all
weans
simply
vacate
the
case
and
remand
with
instructions
to
dismiss
their
appeal.
but
i
think
you
will
find
that
there
has
been
a
competent,
full
adversarial
presentation,
and
that
you
will
have--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
that
is
the
nature
of
cases
before
this
court
by
and
large.
because
they
involve
important
issues,
there
will
be
another
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
will
certainly
be
other
cases.
this
is
an
important
and
recurring
issue.
it
is
the
nature
of
the
beast
that
there
will
be
other
cases.
now,
i
think
the
main
burden
of
our
argument
on
the
merits
here
is
that
both
from
the
standpoint
of
fourth
amendment
policy
and
from
the
standpoint
of
this
court's
precedence,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
there
is
some
strict
and
brief
time
limit
on
detentions
based
on
suspicion
short
of
probable
cause.
this
kind
of
issue
can
arise
in
various
circumstances,
and
i
would
like
to
just
give
a
couple
of
examples
for
the
court
to
have
in
mind.
for
instance,
a
car
may
be
stopped
on
the
basis
of
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
it
is
stolen,
and
it
may
take
five
or
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
to
run
a
computer
check
on
the
license
plate
or
registration
that
is
produced
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
stolen,
and
in
those
circumstances
law
enforcement
officers
would
have
substantial
reasons
for
wanting
to
detain
the
individual
in
the
automobile
long
enough
to
conduct
such
a
check.
that
doesn't
mean
if
it
took
an
hour
or
two
hours
that
they
would
be
justified
in
doing
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
my
suggestion
is
that
there
is
no
hard
and
fast
outer
limit
of
time,
and
that
the
court
in
fact
made
that
quite
clear
in
united
states
against
place
when
it
rejected
the
ali
20-minute
formulation.
ali
had
proposed
a
strict
outer
limit
of
20
minutes.
but
i
think
it
is
quite
clear--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
suggest
that
the
court
has
adopted
the
formula
of
professor
lafave
in
his
treatise,
which
has
been
endorsed
quite
clearly
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
michigan
against
summers,
and
essentially
i
would
sum
it
up
by
saying
that
in
determining
whether
a
detention
is
reasonable,
the
inquiry
should
focus
on
the
purpose
of
extending
the
detention,
that
is,
the
specific
course
of
action
that
the
police
tend
to
pursue
during
the
period,
whether
these
actions
are
likely
to
produce
confirmation
of
their
suspicions
within
a
relatively
short
period,
and
i
am
not
willing
to
give
a
precise
number
to
that.
the
court
should
consider
such
factors
as
the
gravity
of
the
offense
under
investigation,
the
risk
that
the
suspect
would
avoid
apprehension
if
he
is
released,
the
substantiality
of
the
officer's
suspicion,
the
degree
of
inconvenience
caused
to
the
suspect
by
the
detention,
and
the
intrusion
of
circumstances
beyond
the
officer's
control,
and
this
is
quite
relevant
to
this
case,
that
caused
the
prolongation
of
the
detention,
and,
of
course,
considerations
relating
to
the
officer's
personal
safety.
now,
i
understand
that
you
have
consistently
adopted
the
position,
but
ordinarily
in
dissent,
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--hm?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
well,
perhaps
not,
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
even
under
your
views
that
in
this
case
the
government's
position
ought
to
prevail,
and
let
me
explain
that.
you
did
join
the
decision
of
the
court
in
united
states
against
cortez,
where
there
was...
the
issue
was
whether
there
was
reasonable
suspicion.
the
court
all
agreed
that
there
was.
the
car
was
pulled
over,
and
within
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
minutes,
there
was
consent
to
a
search,
which
produced
the
illegal
aliens
who
were
hidden
in
the
back
of
the
vehicle.
now,
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
what
happened
from
the
time
officer
cooke
arrived
at
the
pickup
until
he
acquired
probable
cause,
there
was
a
question
and
answer
period,
a
request
for
consent
to
search.
all
of
this
took
somewhere
around
five
minutes.
savage
had
claimed
that
the
vehicle
was
empty,
and
that
he
was
on
the
way
to
get
the
shock
absorbers
fixed.
cooke
then
conducted
what
we
might
call
a
non-search
inspection
of
the
vehicle.
he
stepped
on
the
bumper
to
see
whether
it
was
empty,
as
had
been
suggested,
or
fully
loaded,
as
he
thought
he
had
observed
in
pursuing
it.
and
he
put
his
nose
up
to
the
vehicle,
took
a
strong
breath,
and
smelled
marijuana.
now,
all
of
this
would
be,
i
think,
within
the
confines
of
what
you
would
agree
would
be
a
permissible
terry
stop,
a
very
concise,
directed
inquiry
of
short
duration.
the
only
reason
in
this
case
that
that
didn't
happen
right
away
is
because
of
the
conduct
of
the
suspects
in
one
of
them
separating
himself
from
the
other
and
proceeding
down
the
road.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
in
those
circumstances
the
government
ought
to
be
permitted
to
conduct
that
narrow
investigation,
and
the
delay
here
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
in
agent
cooke
getting
to
the
scene
so
that
he
could
conduct
that
brief
investigation
should
not
be
counted
in
the
balance
against
the
government.
this
should
be
held
to
be
within
the
scope
of
a
permissible
stop
even
under
the
view
that
only
the
narrowest
kind
of
intrusion
is
justified.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
probably
would
have
been
no
excuse
in
that
case
for
extending
the
detention.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
exigent
circumstances--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
wasn't
planned
in
this
case
that
patrolman
thrasher
would
be
conducting
a
drug
investigation.
he
was
called
in
when--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
were
a
large
group
of
agents
who
were
conducting
an
investigation
in
a
two-county
area
who
were
part
of
the
task
force
that
was
investigating
this
suspected
landing
of
large
quantities
of
marijuana
on
the
beaches
of
north
carolina.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
assume
the
detention
would
not
have
been
as
extended,
but
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
that
could
possibly
have
any
effect
on
the
correct
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
there
cannot...
i
mean,
unless
you
are
saying
that
whatever
number
of
agents
they
are
going
to
use
in
an
investigation,
they
ought
to
double
them,
so
in
case
they
run
into
two
cars
together,
they
have
two
people
to
stop
them.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
right,
but
the
only
help
was--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--this
is
a
little
bit
like
the
suggestion
of
florida
against
royer
that
the
government
ought
to
have
a
dog
handy
at
every
airport.
i
mean,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
they
don't
have
one
at
every
airport.
i
mean,
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
we
have
no
evidence
about
the
nature
of
the
rest
of
the
investigation,
what
the
agents
were
doing.
the
idea
that
cooke
should
have
been...
the
court
has
no
basis,
it
seems
to
me,
for
suggesting
that
cooke
should
have
been
accompanied
by
another
drug
agent.
cooke...
a
situation
developed
in
which--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--if
the
court
concludes
that
the
respondents
should
gain
because
savage
refused
to
stop
when
asked
to
stop
and
sped
off
down
the
highway
and
created
this
situation,
which
could
not
have
been...
i
mean,
even
on
your
hypothesis,
there
is
no
reason
why
cooke
wouldn't
suppose
that
one
trained
dea
agent
would
be
enough.
how
could
he
anticipate
this
kind
of
development?
if
they
have
to
staff
their
investigations
to
anticipate
something
like
that,
you
will
have
nothing
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
but
the
other
agents,
who
knows
where
they
were?
i
mean,
this
seems
to
me
a
prescription,
if
the
concern
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
about
police...
controlling
the
conduct
of
the
police,
the
prescription--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
don't
do
anything
more
than
is
reasonably
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
confirming
or
rebutting
your
suspicions
within
a
reasonably
short
period
of
time,
but
i
simply
cannot
see
how
the
court
could
say
in
this
case
that
the
agent--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--now
you
are
asking
me...
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
could
call
and
ask
for
help
in
stopping
that
vehicle.
now,
if
his--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--at
7:00
o'clock
in
the
morning,
i
think
there
probably
would
not
have
been
four
green
chevrolets
speeding
down
the
highway.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
question
is
whether
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
the
stop,
and
i
have
no
difficulty
in
saying
that
he
could
call
for
help.
now,
if
you
suddenly
ran
into
a
car
dealers'
convention
then
you
might
not
be
able
to
stop
any
of
them.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
just
wanted
to
make
a
couple
of
points.
mr.
kadish
said
that
my
argument
would
lead
to
a
major
expansion
of
terry
doctrine,
so
i
wanted
to
remind
the
court
of
what
it
said
in
michigan
against
summers.
it
said
that
terry
is
not
"an
almost
unique
exception
to
a
hard
and
fast
standard
of
probable
cause.
"
"rather,
the
key
principle
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
reasonableness,
balancing
of
competing
interests.
"
it
said
that
if
the
purpose
underlying
a
terry
stop,
investigating
possible
criminal
activity,
is
to
be
served,
the
police
must
under
certain
circumstances
be
able
to
detain
the
individual
for
longer
than
the
brief
time
period
involved
in
terry
and
adams.
it
endorsed
professor
lafave's
summary
of
the
governing
principles
that
the
permissibility
of
extending
a
terry
stop
should
turn
on
"whether
the
police
are
diligently
pursuing
a
means
of
investigation
which
is
likely
to
resolve
the
matter
one
way
or
another
very
soon,
and
whether
it
is
rather
essential
to
the
investigation
that
the
suspect's
presence
be
continued
during
that
interval.
"
and
in
place,
while
the
court
struck
down
a
90-minute
detention,
i
think
the
clear
inference
was
that
it
had
taken
20
or
30
minutes
to
expose
the
luggage
to
a
drug
detecting
dog--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
i
think
we
have
some,
but
i
don't
know
that
i
could...
they
are
cited
in
the
brief.
there
are
many
courts
of
appeals
decisions
on
these
issues,
and
i
could--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
am
not
at
all
familiar
with
the
state
courts,
but
i
would
rather
have
supreme
court
decisions
in
my
favor,
and
i
think
i
do.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
relying
on
an
analysis
or
an
approach
that
has
been
consistently
in
recent
cases--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
i
don't
know
whether
we
would
be
here
suggesting
that
two
or
three
hours
would
be
permissible.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
because
the
approach
requires
looking
at
the
need
to
extend
the
detention,
and
it
recognizes,
as
i
think
dunaway,
which
was
a
totally
different
cases,
recognizes,
that
there
is
an
outer
limit
on
the
permissible
length
of
time
that
you
could
detain
somebody.
but
i
cannot
believe
that
we
step
back
from
it
and
look
at
this
case,
you
are
a
dea
agent,
you
suspect
there
is
a
truckload
of
marijuana
going
down
the
highway,
you
want
to
try
to
find
out
whether
you
can
confirm
your
suspicions
instead
of
letting
over
a
ton
of
marijuana
go
off
into
the
distribution
chain.
is
it
really
so
unreasonable
to
do
what
the
officers
did
in
this
case?
does
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
say
that
these
rather
modest
measures
can't
be
taken
for
the
purpose
of
a
very
important
societal
interest
such
as
the
detention
of
this
kind
of
crime?
i
just
find
it
difficult
to
believe,
and
i
just
wanted
to
say
to
justice
brennan
that
the
not
free
to
leave
point,
if
he
were
free
to
leave,
there
would
not
be
a
seizure
regulated
by
the
fourth
amendment.
this
case
is
about
the
difference,
where
the
line
is
between
a
seizure
that
is
permissible
on
reasonable
suspicion
and
a
seizure
that
requires
probable
cause.
both
of
those
are
similarly
characterized
by
the
suspect
not
being
free
to
leave,
and
therefore
the
fact
that
he
says
i
would
like
to
leave
and
the
officers
say
no
seems
to
me
quite
immaterial
to
the
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
would
be
true,
although
i
think
the
principle
of
michigan
against
summers
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
find
out
very
shortly
whether
you
have
a
basis
for
arresting
the
individual
or
you
hope
to,
then
you
are
not
obliged
to
let
him
go
off
into
the
twilight.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
could,
but
i
think
one
of
the
points
that
mr.
kadish
was
in
error
about
was
that
the
place
case
was
very
careful
to
make
the
point
that
at
least
in
those
circumstances
it
was
not
distinguishing
between
the
seizure
of
the
property
and
the
seizure
of
the
person,
but
was
deeming
them
both
regulated
by
