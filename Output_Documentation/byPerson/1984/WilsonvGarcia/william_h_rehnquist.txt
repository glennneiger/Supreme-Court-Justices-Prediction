justice
rehnquist
well,
we
certainly
have
to
take
the
word
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
as
to
questions
of
state
law
and
state
legislative
intent.
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
here
held
that
the
two-year
statute
was
the
applicable
one,
and
the
state
court
in
1983--
justice
rehnquist
--but
unless
you
are
talking
about
a
residuary
statute,
you
are
going
to
have
some
sprawl
or
overlap
any
time
you
try
to
fit
a
1983
action
with
all
of
its
varieties
into
some
specific
state
tort
limitation.
justice
rehnquist
your
argument
is
essentially
then
that
we
should
disregard
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
not
because
it
improperly
applied
state
law,
but
because
characterization
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
rehnquist
wasn't
it...
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
write
an
opinion
in
the
process
of--
justice
rehnquist
--don't
the
new
mexico
appellate
courts
follow
that
as
binding
precedent?
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
any
event,
the
new
mexico
courts
are
treating
it
as
a
decision
with
precedential
value.
isn't
that
true?
justice
rehnquist
and
in
sayna
school
bus?
