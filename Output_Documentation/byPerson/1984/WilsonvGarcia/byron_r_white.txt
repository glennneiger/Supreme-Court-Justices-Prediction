justice
white
that
may
be
true,
but
if
a
1983
action
were
brought
in
the
state
court,
there
isn't
much
question
about
what
the
applicable
statute
would
be,
is
there?
justice
white
why
wouldn't
the
lower
courts
of
new
mexico
have
to
follow
devargas?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
is
just...
that
is
true
only
if
you
win
this
lawsuit.

justice
white
what
if
we
decide
in
the
case
that
preceded
this
one
that
the
federal
courts
must
apply
the
statute
that
the
state
courts
would
apply
to
a
1983
suit?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
if
we
do
decide--
justice
white
--what
if
we
decide
just
that
in
the
case
that
preceded
this?
then
the
tenth
circuit
is
wrong
and
you
are
wrong.
justice
white
i
know,
but
if
we
decide
what
i
suggested
in
the
case
before,
a
lot
of
the
inquiry
is
pretermitted,
because
if
the
state
court
or...
a
state
legislature
or
a
state
court
expressly
finds
that
this
is
the
statute
that
applies
to
1983
actions,
then
isn't
the
only
question
left
inconsistency?
justice
white
so
you
could
say
the
only
question
that
would
be
left
would
be
inconsistency.
isn't
that
right?
