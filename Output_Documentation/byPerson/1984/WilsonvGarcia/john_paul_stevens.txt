justice
stevens
mr.
farber,
all
this
goes
to
the
merits,
and
if
this
is
all
that
clear,
i
wonder
why
you
waited
two
years
to
sue.
justice
stevens
isn't
your
basic
argument
that
all
this
unfairness,
and
time,
and
figuring
out
what
the
right
statute
of
limitations
is,
that
is
really
a
criticism
of
congress
for
not
enacting
a
uniform
statute
of
limitations.
it
is
not--
justice
stevens
--they
haven't,
and
until
they
do
we
are
going
to
have
a
million
of
these
cases.
justice
stevens
mr.
farber,
may
i
interrupt
you?
justice
stevens
is
it
not
correct
that
under
your
approach
and,
i
think,
the
tenth
circuit's
approach,
even
if
the
new
mexico
legislature
had
said
in
so
many
words,
we
intend
this
to
apply
to
1983
actions,
you
would
still
make
the
same
argument?
justice
stevens
would
you
say
that
even
if
it
were
a
shorter
statute?
justice
stevens
well,
then
why
do
you
ever
have
to
look
past...
then
i
don't
understand
how
you
ever
reach
the
third
question,
because
if
you
limit
the
third
inquiry
to
statutes
that
are
even
longer,
it
seems
to
me
you--
justice
stevens
--if
you
say
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
all
1983
actions
are
most
analogous
to
a
personal
injury
tort
case,
and
you
always
look
at
the
state
statute
for
a
personal
injury
lawsuit,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
ball
game?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
they
could
enact
a
longer
statute.
that
is
what
you
are
really
saying.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
they
could
permit
a
longer
period.
justice
stevens
of
course,
it
is
pretty
unlikely,
isn't
it,
that
a
state
would
adopt
a
longer
statute
for
suits
against
its
officers
than--
justice
stevens
mr.
hall,
your
opponent
did
to
a
certain
extent
argue
that,
but
i
don't
understand
the
tenth
circuit
to
have
so
reasoned.
do
you?
they
don't
say
that
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
misconstrued
state
law.
justice
stevens
that's
right.
