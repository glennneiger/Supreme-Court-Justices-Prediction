justice
o'connor
mr.
hall,
the
court
of
appeals,
because
it
took
a
global
approach
to
this
1983
problem,
simply
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
decide
what
statute
new
mexico
would
apply
here,
and
the
district
court
below
apparently
thought
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
the
two-year
statute,
was
inapplicable.
is
that
right?
and
you
think
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
its
view?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
do
concede,
of
course,
i
suppose,
that
there
is
a
federal
question
involved
here
on
characterization.
