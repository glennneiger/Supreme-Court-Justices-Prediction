mr.
bruce
m.
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
with
the
case
just
submitted,
as
your
honor's
questions
indicate,
this,
too,
is
a
case
involving
the
application
of
a
state
statute
of
limitations
to
a
1983
civil
rights
action.
it
arises
out
of
an
incident
of
alleged
police
brutality.
the
petitioners,
who
were
the
defendants
below,
moved
to
dismiss
this
action
which
had
been
filed
some
two
and
one-half
years
after
the
incident
occurred,
and
moved
to
dismiss
it
on
the
basis
of
a
state
statute
of
limitation
which
provided
that
all
actions
against
government
entities
and
public
employees
for
their
torts
must
be
filed
within
two
years.
it
is
clear
that
had
the
case
been
filed
in
state
court
in
new
mexico,
that
that
limitation
provision
would
have
been
applied
and
this
case
dismissed
on
petitioners'
motion.
the
lower
federal
courts,
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court,
have
refused
to
follow
the
decision
of
the
state's
highest
court
and
apply
that
two-year
limitation.
the
petitioners
submit
that
this
is
wrong.
it
is
wrong
under
the
language
of
section
1988,
which
provides
the
rule
of
decision.
it
is
wrong
under
the
characterization
and
application
of
1988
by
this
court.
it
is
wrong,
quite
simply,
because
the
state
judicial
decision
supplied
the
state
rule
of
law,
and
unless
inconsistent
with
the
united
states
constitution
or
the
policies
of
deterrence
and
compensation
underlying
1983,
that
state
rule
of
decision
is
to
be
borrowed.
the
cases
of
the
court
on
this
point
are
quite
clear.
there
is
no
basis
for
distinguishing
between
a
state
court
judicial
decision
and
an
express
legislative
determination
which
would
by
its
terms
apply
to
1983
actions.
as
a
matter
of
settled
jurisprudence,
a
construction
by
a
state
court
of
a
state
limitation
is
itself
part
of
the
statute,
and
does
not
represent
simply
a
common
law
decision.
given
that
fact,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
1988
intended
to
borrow
and
have
govern,
as
it
states,
not
only
the
statutes
of
limitations
which
the
state
courts
would
apply,
but
those
statutes
of
limitations,
general,
which
the
state's
highest
court
has
said
are
expressly
applicable.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
justice,
the
circuit
court,
i
agree,
never
really
reached
the
question
of
what
was
state
legislative
intent
as
expressed
in
the
state
court
opinion.
now,
the
district
court
opinion
is
quite
interesting.
the
district
judge
acknowledges
that
had
there
been
an
express
legislative
provision
saying
that
this
two-year
limitation
is
applicable
to
actions
against
governmental
entities
and
public
employees
for
their
torts
and
constitutional
torts,
that
that
should
have
been
followed
under
section
1988.
the
district
court
essentially
disagreed
with
the
new
mexico
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
new
mexico's
own
limitation.
now,
the
district
judge
also
found
freedom,
as
did
the
circuit
court,
in
the
principle
that
because
we
are
applying
a
limitation
to
a
1983
action,
and
because
characterizations
of
that
action
are
involved,
that
that
is
finally
a
federal
question,
and
that
it
is
the
freedom
of
this
federal
question,
and
that
it
is
the
freedom
of
this
federal
question
which
allows
the
federal
courts
to
ignore
the
state
rule
decision.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
most
certainly.
now,
in
this
case,
i
said
i
disagreed,
and
i
am
going
to
take
it
back
just
a
bit.
where
characterization
is
necessary,
certainly
that
characterization
is
a
federal
question.
where
you
have
an
express
legislative
determination,
or
where
you
have
the
application
of
the
general
limitation
clearly
defined
by
statelaw,
i
don't
believe
that
characterization
is
necessary.
it
is
still
a
federal
question.
it
is
simply
irrelevant
under
that
analysis.
i
don't
think
characterization
was
ever
intended
by
this
court
to
be
anything
other
than
a
means
of
identifying
state
law,
and
given
the
structure
and
confusing
structure
of
state
statutes
of
limitations,
that
has
been
a
very
necessary
characterization
for
the
lower
federal
courts
to
use.
i
think
it
is
very
appropriate
for
the
lower
courts
to
attempt
in
addressing
that
federal
question,
justice,
when
it
is
available
to
the
federal
courts,
to
address
it
as
a
federal
question,
and
address
it
in
a
way
that
will
provide
not
only
some
guide
to
the
lower
district
courts,
but
to
the
entire
federal
judicial
system
in
arriving
at
the
most
analogous
state
cause
of
action.
but
this
question
still
is
a
question,
though
it
is
a
federal
question,
the
question
that
is
really
asked
is,
what
is
state
law?
and
those
circuits
which
have
acknowledged
that
characterization
is
merely
a
means
of
identifying
state
law,
have
quite
appropriately
where
there
is
an
express
state
determination,
an
application
of
a
particular
limitation,
said
that
this
characterization
is
no
longer
necessary.
so,
it
is
our
position
that
characterization
is
what
this
court
has
said
it
is,
and
that
is
only
a
tool.
this
statute
of
limitations,
the
two-year
new
mexico
limitation,
if
there
were
no
state
court
decision,
would
certainly
be
the
most
analogous
cause
of
action.
it
is
certainly
the
most
specific
applicable
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
this
is
a
very
straightforward
physical
assault
and
battery
action,
though
it
of
course
raises
grave
constitutional
actions
as
well
as
simply
common
law
torts.
but
certainly
in
terms
of
the
underlying
facts,
there
is
nothing
exotic
about
it
which
requires
difficult
analysis
to
find
the
most
appropriate
limitation.
the
two-year
limitation
which
the
state
has
applies
to
state
causes
of
actions
against
law
enforcement
officers
for
their
assaults
and
batteries,
but
also,
and
we
submit
this
is
significant,
it
is
a
two-year
limitation
which
applies
to
a
state
cause
of
action
against
law
enforcement
officers
for
bodily
injury
that
they
have
caused
and
results
in
a
deprivation
of
united
states
constitutional
rights.
i
believe
this
is
a
very
unique
provision
of
state
law,
when
you
examine
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
scheme.
it
contains
this
quite
unusual
recognition
of
the
development
of
1983
action
certainly
in
the
area
of
actions
against
law
enforcement
officers
by
stating
quite
specifically
that
under
statelaw,
there
is
a
right
to
sue
a
law
enforcement
officer
for
depriving
one
of
his
constitutional
rights.
so,
when
you
analyze
this
case
in
terms
not
only
of
underlying
facts,
who
did
what
to
whom,
but
what
are
the
elements
of
it,
there
is
a
very
clear
analogy,
and
the
lower
federal
courts
were
simply
wrong
in
not
following
that
analogy.
this
statute
as
well
as
the
case
before
you
does
involve
drawing
a
different
limitation
period
for
certain
actions
against
public
officials
and
private
individuals.
private
assaults
would
be
allowed
three
years
to
sue
under
new
mexico
law.
this
statute
allows
suits
against
government
entities
and
public
officials
for
these
types
of
suits
to
be
filed.
they
must
be
filed
within
two
years.
it
is
argued,
of
course,
that
that
in
end
of
itself
is
an
inconsistency
which
requires
that
this
statute
be
rejected.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
an
inconsistency
which
undercuts,
is
hostile
to
1983
goals
of
compensation
and
deterrence.
it
is
not
enough
to
examine
simply
the
difference
in
the
period
of
time
without,
i
submit,
examining
the
entire
statute
in
which
this
limitation
is
contained.
and
when
that
is
done,
justices,
there
is
something
very
important
found
in
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act.
that
act
makes
the
state
in
effect
a
liability
insurance
company
to
pay
actions,
both
the
state
law
for
torts
which
can
be
brought
against
the
state,
and
also
expressly
provides
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
will
pay
all
settlements
and
judgments
which
are
brought
against
state
public
officials,
not
only
for
state
torts
but
again
for
deprivation
of
united
states
constitutional
rights.
this
statutory
scheme,
which
the
respondents
find
so
hostile
to
1983,
in
fact
makes
1983
recoveries
more
than,
as
they
can
be
in
some
cases,
only
a
paper
judgment.
it
guarantees
the
payment,
the
compensation
which
implements
1983
goals.
there
is
necessarily
in
any
state's
consideration
of
meshing
its
tort
claim
scheme
to
1983
actions
considerations
which
i
believe
are
different
than
those
in
the
private
sector,
and
what
finally
must
be
decided
is
whether
the
balancing
involved
is
a
reasonable
balancing.
i
would
observe
that
congress
as
well
in
considering
the
availability
of
private
actions
versus
suits
against
the
government
has
drawn
similar
distinctions.
in
maritime
torts,
united
states
boats
are
subject
to
suit
within
two
years.
maritime
torts
against
private
owners,
three
years.
so
there
is
necessarily
in
any
consideration
of
compensation
such
as
the
new
mexico
legislation
is
addressed
to
a
balancing
of
factors,
and
the
question
becomes
whether
that
balancing
has
been
carried
on
reasonably.
the
final
test
really
of
inconsistency
here
is
whether
any
state
policy,
any
state
rule,
any
state
interest
which
is
exhibited
in
that
limitation
has
somehow
precluded
this
respondent
from
getting
to
the
federal
court,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
quite
clear.
for
two
years
the
courthouse
doors
were
open
to
the
respondent
without
any
possible
hostility
exhibited
by
state
law
in
any
respect.
the
respondent's
action
here
is
precluded
quite
simply
because
he
slept
on
his
rights
for
a
period
of
two
years.
no
reasonable
argument,
and
it
is
not
made
in
any
of
the
briefs,
is
made
that
that
period
of
time
is
too
short.
it
is
the
same
period
of
time
which
congress
in
waiving
united
states
immunity
allows
for
actions
against
federal
law
enforcement
officers
under
the
tort
claim
act.
we
submit
that
this
provision,
this
limitation,
which
is
general
in
its
scope,
does
not
discriminate
against
1983
and
civil
rights
actions.
it
is
not
inconsistent.
and
petitioners
ask
that
the
motions
which
they
have
filed
nd
pursued
in
both
lower
federal
courts
be
granted
here,
and
the
case
dismissed.
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
the
prospectivity
issue
alone,
there
was
no
reasonable
reliance
by
the
respondent
on
any
particular
view
of
this
rule
which
was
significantly
changed
or
altered
by
the
tenth
circuit,
as
the
granting
of
the
interlocutory
appeal
itself
indicates.
there
were
indeed
different
views
on
whether
the
two-year
limitation
should
apply,
and
in
fact
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
is
a
reversal
of
its
prior
approach
to
these
cases,
which
would
apply
the
two-year
limitation.
there
is
the
statement
made
that
again
state
law
has
been
incorrectly
interpreted
by
state
courts.
the
statement
is
made
here
several
times
that
there
is
no
reference
to
1983
actions
as
such
in
the
limitation
or
the
statutory
scheme.
what
it
says,
and
it
says
specifically,
is
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
in
state
law
against
law
enforcement
officers
for
deprivation
of
any
rights,
privileges,
or
immunities
secured
by
the
united
states
constitution.
any
tort
lawyer
can
read
that
quite
clearly
as
a
reference
to
1983
actions.
when
you
finally
come
down
to
it,
the
question
of
was
the
state's
decision
of
its
own
law
wrong,
that
question
really
can't
even
be
asked
in
this
context.
the
point
is,
it
is
the
state's
decision,
and
in
the
only
matter
in
which
this
is
relevant
it
is
state
law.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
no,
justice,
they
said
it's
irrelevant.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
that's
what
they
said,
in
a
footnote.
i
think
that
is
the
significance
of
this
case.
it
is
not
a
happy
result
for
federalism
when
federal
courts
directed
by
a
federal
rule
of
decision
statute
such
as
1988
are
told
to
borrow
state
law,
and
that
it
should
govern.
that
state
law,
as
observed
and
applied
in
the
state
courts,
is
simply
relegated
to
a
footnote
and
regarded
as
irrelevant.
that
is
not
what
section
1988
intended.
it
is
not
only
an
unhappy
result
for
federalism,
it
is
an
unhappy
result
for
plain
principles
of
judicial
comity.
we
are
left
with
an
irreconcilable
difference
between
state
and
federal
courts
in
applying
their
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
1983
actions
which
simply
cannot
and
should
not
be
permitted
to
continue.
