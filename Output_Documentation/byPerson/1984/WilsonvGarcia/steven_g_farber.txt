mr.
steven
g.
farber
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act
was
enacted
as
a
legislative
response
to
the
judicial
abrogation
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
it
is
only
a
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
there
is
no
legislative
intent
within
the
entire
confines
of
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act
that
evidences
any
desire
on
the
part
of
the
new
mexico
legislature
to
apply
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act
to
1983
actions
which
are
filed
for
the
deprivation
of
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
and
federal
law.
the
particular
provision
of
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act
which
the
petitioners
in
this
case
seek
to
urge
is
the
two-year
limitation
period
found
in
section
15
of
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
which
refers
exclusively
to
torts.
and
as
chief
judge
bratton
of
the
new
mexico
district
court
found
in
analyzing
legislative
intent,
and
as
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
wells
versus
county
of
valencia
found
in
examining
legislative
intent
in
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
the
new
mexico
legislature
distinguishes
between
a
tort
and
a
constitutional
deprivation.
there
is
no,
and
i
repeat,
no
expressed
reference
anywhere
within
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act
to
1983
actions,
to
1981
actions,
to
1982
actions,
to
1985
actions.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
in
the
devargas
decision
on
certiorari,
which
is
found
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
15
and
16,
there
is
no
discussion
of
legislative
intent.
what
the
court
basically
did
was,
it
looked
to
this
court's
decision
in
timanio,
and
it
said,
we
think
the
most
analogous
statute
of
limitations
is
that
found
in
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
section
15,
based
upon
a
violation
of
section
12,
which
applies
solely
to
law
enforcement
officers.
the
net
effect
of
that
decision
is
that
a
whole
wide
range
of
1983
actions
that
simply
are
not
covered,
were
never
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
are
now
apparently
under
that
reading
of
the
devargas
decision
covered
by
a
two-year
limitation
period.
there
is
no
way
that
a
zoning
due
process
type
case
filed
because
of
1983
can
come
within
the
arguable
confines
of
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act
or
be
analogous,
yet--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--not
based
upon
the
tenth
circuit's
method
of
characterization,
which
i
believe
follows
the
case
of
burnett
versus
gratton,
which
this
court
decided
six
months
ago.
in
burnett
versus
gratton,
this
court
set
forth
a
three-stage
process.
first,
the
court
said
that
in
attempting
to
borrow
a
rule
where
federal
law
is
deficient,
you
look
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states
to
the
extent
that
they
are
suitable
to
carry
the
civil
rights
statutes
into
effect.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
no,
i
have
three
arguments
why
the
devargas
decision
should
not
be
followed.
one,
it
is
not
an
analogous
statute
of
limitations,
as
the
devargas
decision
says
that
it
is.
two,
it
characterizes
1983
actions
in
a
discriminatory
fashion.
and
three,
and
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
about
the
devargas
decision
on
certiorari,
it
was
a
decision
that
quashed
certiorari
as
being
improvidently
issued,
and
my
understanding
of
the
law
is
that
when
a
decision
quashing
certiorari
is
issued,
it
is
not
precedent.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
they
did
write
an
opinion,
but
it
was
called
a
decision
of
certiorari.
excuse
me.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
i
think
they
have
been
incorrect
in
following
that.
if
the
court
will
look--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--some...
in
cosart
they
did,
yes.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
yes,
but
i
think
that
they
were
not
the
most
analogous
state
statute
of
limitations
to
be
applied
to
1983
actions.
it
is
somewhat
curious
how
the
devargas
decision
on
certiorari
came
to
be
published,
by
the
way.
on
page
22
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
is
an
affidavit
from
rose
marie
aldereti,
the
clerk
of
the
new
mexico
supreme
court,
in
which
she
says
that
the
devargas
decision
on
certiorari
is
not
to
be
published,
it
is
not
a
recorded
opinion,
and
it
won't
be
cited
as
precedent.
after
we
filed
a
motion
in
the
district
court
attaching
that
affidavit
to
a
reply
to
new
authority,
because
the
devargas
decision
was
decided
after
we
filed
our
lawsuit,
then
the
decision
became
published.
i
don't
know
how
that
happened,
but
that
is
the
sequential
events
leading
up
to
the
publishing
of
the
devargas
decision.
if
one
reads
the
devargas
decision,
there
is
no
attempt
to
analogize.
a
1983
action--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--i
think
if
a
1983
action
were
brought
in
state
court,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be
what
the
federal
courts
have
said
that
it
is,
which
is
that
you
have
to--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--because
of
the
supremacy
clause.
this
court
has
said--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--well,
i
think
that
it
is
not
just
true
based
upon
this
lawsuit.
i
think
it
is
true
based
upon
the
line
of
cases
which
this
court
has
developed
in
attempting
to
analogize
and
decide
what
that
appropriate
or
analogous
statute
of
limitations
is.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
departure
from
the
decisions
of
this
case.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
no,
i
think
that
based
upon
the
characterization
of
a
federal
civil
rights
action
as
being
an
injury
to
personal
rights,
that
the
most
analogous
state
statute
of
limitations
in
new
mexico
is
the
new
mexico
personal
injury
statute,
which
allows
a
lawsuit
to
be
filed
within
three
years
from
the
date
of
the
injury.
this
court--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--discrimination,
and
we
have
that
argument
in
this
case
also.
inconsistency
with
federal
policy.
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
it
is
not
going
to
follow
state
law
automatically.
to
be
sure,
state
law
is--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--whether
it
is
unreasonable
and
not
consistent
with
federal
civil
rights
policy,
and
whether
it
discriminates
against
the
federal
cause
of
action,
and
those
arguments
are
made
in
our
case,
and
are
shown
by
the
facts
of
the
case.
based
upon
the
underlying
approach
analysis
which
has
been
urged
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
there
could
be
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations
applied
to
certain
types
of
civil
rights
claims
brought
against
law
enforcement
officers,
but
interestingly
enough,
if
a
law
enforcement
officer
was
discriminated
against,
or
if
a
law
enforcement
officer
had
his
first
amendment
rights
violated,
that
law
enforcement
officer
would
have
either
three
or
four
years
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
but
if
someone
has
their
rights
abused
by
a
governmental
authority
through
law
enforcement
agencies,
that
person
only
has
two
years
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
there
has
been,
and
i
think
this
is
the
reason
that
the
tenth
circuit
took
the
approach
that
it
did,
a
colossal
burden
on
the
federal
courts
by
litigation
based
upon
the
underlying
conduct
approach,
and
we
have
cited
the
authorities
and
the
collections
of
cases
in
footnotes
9,
11,
and
13
of
our
brief,
where
there
has
just
been
this
wide
range
of
litigation.
this
case
has
been
going
on,
on
january
28th
it
will
be
three
years,
solely
on
the
basis
of
what
is
the
proper
statute
of
limitations
to
be
applied
to
the
remedial
1983
action
that
was
filed
in
this
case
seeking
compensation
for
the
severe
personal
injuries
that
my
client
received
and
deterrence,
so
that
this
type
of
governmental
abuse
will
not
occur
again.
and
i
think
that
it
is
important
at
this
moment
to
point
out
just
very
briefly
and
succinctly
that
the
complaint
alleges
that
gary
garcia
was
viciously
and
brutally
beaten
by
petitioner
wilson,
sprayed
with
teargas,
that
richard
wilson
was
hired
by
petitioner
vigil,
who
was
the
chief
of
the
new
mexico
state
police,
even
though
petitioner
vigil
had
been
advised
by
two
high-ranking
police
officers
of
the
new
mexico
state
police
not
to
hire
this
man
because
the
man
had
been
fired
for
stealing
from
a
prior
employer,
the
man
had
arrest
warrants
outstanding
against
him,
and
the
man
had
several
convictions,
and
four
days
prior
to
the
beating
in
this
case,
petitioner
wilson
brutally
assaulted
two
women
in
rio
riva
county,
new
mexico,
and
that
fact
was--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--part
of
it
was
that...
it
deals
within
the
practicalities
of
the
litigation.
you
have
an
uneducated
man
in
ria
riva
county,
new
mexico,
who
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
at
a
trial
where
all
the
facts
came
out,
and
then
learned
about
his
cause
of
action
against
petitioner
vigil.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
i
think
this
court
has
criticized
congress
each
and
every
time
it
has
written
a
statute
of
limitations
case,
because
the
answer
would
be
resolved
simply
if
congress
said,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
x
years.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
and
that
is
why
the
approach
of
the
tenth
circuit
makes
sense,
because
it
creates
a
theme
which
this
court
can
follow,
that
is
consistent
with
the
concept
of
federalism,
it
is
consistent
with
the
remedial
nature
of
1983
actions
and
the
dual
policies
of
compensation
and
deterrence,
and
it
is
consistent
with
the
settled
expectations
and
repose
policies
of
the
states,
because
now
people
will
know
what
they
have
to
do.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
yes.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
if
congress
had
enacted
a
statute
and
made
it
applicable
to
1983,
no,
that
would
end
the
inquiry,
but
we
don't
have--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--it
would
end
the
case,
but
it
hasn't.
and
the
two-year
statute,
it
does
not
apply
to
1983
actions
in
new
mexico.
as
we
have
shown
in
the
survey
which
is
attached
as
a
part
of
the
appendix,
part
b,
the
approach
of
the
tenth
circuit
does
not
lead
to
nationwide
uniformity,
which
this
court
has
said
is
not
a
goal
of
the
federal
civil
rights
acts
in
footnote
11
in
the
robertson
versus
reagan
case.
what
it
does
is,
it
creates
a...
and
we
show
that
there
is
a
range
of
50
statutes
of
limitations
for
the
states
and
the
territories
that
would
apply
to
civil
rights
actions
based
upon
the
characterization
of
the
injury
as
being
an
injury
to
personal
rights.
what
you
do
under
burnett
versus
gratton
is,
you
use
the
federal
laws
to
the
extent
that
they
are
suitable
to
understand
what
it
is
when
one's
rights
are
violated,
and
we
have
set
forth
the
legislative
history
at
pages
17
to
23,
which
i
believe
supports
the
characterization
of
an
injury
to
civil
rights
as
being
an
injury
to
personal
rights.
you
then
look
to
state
law.
no
one
in
this
case
has
suggested
that
you
don't
look
to
state
law
to
find
the
statute
of
limitations.
but
the
second
step
of
the
burnett
versus
gratton
test
is
to
look
to
state
law,
and
for
each
state
it
is
different,
although
some
of
the
years
are
the
same.
it
ranges
from
one
year
in
california
to
six
years
in
north
dakota.
unless
we
have
an
approach
that
gives
that
degree
of
limited
uniformity,
rather
than
50
statutes
of
limitations,
this
court
may
well
be
burdened
with
150
or
200,
and
i
think
the
example
of
the
case
of
polite
from
the
third
circuit
is
strikingly
clear.
in
that
case
there
were
allegations
that
there
was
excessive
force
used,
a
false
arrest,
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
a
car,
and
coercion
of
a
guilty
plea,
and
based
upon
the
cause
of
action,
the
federal
cause
of
action
that
was
filed,
the
third
circuit
analogized
those
claims
to
state
law
and
found
in
the
same
case
that
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
ought
to
apply
to
the
false
arrest
claim.
the
court
found
that
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations
ought
to
apply
to
the
coercion
of
guilty
claim
and
the
assault
and
battery
claim,
analogizing
these
to
common
law
torts,
and
that
a
six-year
statute
of
limitations
ought
to
apply
to
the
illegal
search
claim
based
upon
the
car...
based
upon
the
pennsylvania
cause
of
action
for
recovery
of
goods.
i
suggest
that
that
is
not
a
concrete,
proper
resolution
to
the
issue
of
statutes
of
limitations.
it
has
caused
intolerable
burdens
on
the
federal
courts,
and
the
cases
which
we
have
collected,
once
again,
in
section
9...
footnotes
9,
11,
and
13,
i
think,
show
that.
the
characterization
method
which
the
tenth
circuit
utilized
and
which
we
think
is
appropriate
and
proper
is
something
which
this
court
has
historically
engaged
in
as
far
back
as
1905,
and
we
have
summarized
that
in
footnote
5
of
the
red
respondent's
brief.
in
the
case
of
mclain
versus
rankin,
which
was
a
national
bank
assessment
action,
what
the
court
did
was,
the
court
looked
to
the
law
and
it
said,
we
think
that
this
action
is
a
liability
based
upon
a
statute
against
the
claim
that
it
was
a
contract
action.
the
court
then
looked
to
the
law
of
the
particular
state,
the
forum
state,
for
an
analogous
statute
of
limitations,
and
finding
none,
the
court
then
applied
the
residuary
statute
of
limitations.
this
had
been
done
consistently
where
the
court
as
a
part
of
the
characterization
process
determines
for
itself
the
essential
nature
of
the
federal
right
which
has
been
conferred
by
congress,
and
then
applies
the
most
analogous
and
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
under
state
law.
in
this
case,
if
one
characterizes
the
action
as
an
action
for
injury
to
personal
rights,
and
then
looks
to
state
law,
the
conclusion
is
that
it
is
the
personal
injury
statute,
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations,
because
the
two-year
limitation
provision
of
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act
does
not
apply.
it
refers
exclusively
to
torts,
and
consistently
throughout
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
as
was
noted
by
judge
bratton,
and
as
was
noted
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
in
wells
versus
county
of
valencia,
a
decision
totally
inconsistent
with
devargas,
the
legislature
distinguishes
between
torts
and
1983
actions,
and
if
in
fact
the
legislature
had
intended
the
tort
claims
act
to
apply
to
1983
actions,
it
would
have
said
so.
it
did
not
say
so.
it
does
not
apply.
the
tort
claims
act
is
a
very
limited
waiver
of
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
it
has
not,
as
i
have
said,
waived
immunity
for
the
wide
range
of
actions--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--yes.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
yes,
but
there
would
be
a
difference,
because
i
think
in
that
circumstance,
the
third
part
of
the
burnett
versus
gratton
test
comes
into
play.
you
have
the
federal
characterization
as
an
injury
to
personal
rights.
you
look
to
state
law.
you
find
the
state
personal
injury
statute.
and
lo
and
behold,
there
is
this
other
statute
that
says
it
specifically
applies
to
1983
actions.
i
think
the
court
then
has
to
look
and
see
whether
the
time
periods
are
the
same,
because
if
they
are
giving
less
time
for
the
1983
action
than
for
the
other
action,
you
have
a
discriminatory
statute
of
limitations.
if
you
have
at
the
same
time,
if
you
have
a
statute
of
limitations
that
is
a
part
of
let's
just
say
a
tort
claims
act
which
allows
compensatory
damages
without
a
limit,
unlike
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
which
allows
punitive
damages,
unlike
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
which
doesn't
have
a
restrictive
notice
provision,
unlike
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
which
doesn't
discriminate
against
a
federal
cause
of
action,
unlike
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
and
which
allows
in
this
case
a
cause
of
action
against
a
police
officer
for
action
under
color
of
law
but
outside
the
course
and
scope
of
his
duties,
unlike
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act,
then
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
use
that
statute
of
limitations,
because
it
is
consistent
with
this
nation's
federal
civil
rights
policy.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
no,
i
would
not,
because
i
think
it
discriminates
against--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--because
you
have
to
make
that
judgment.
you
have
to
defer
to
the
state
to
see
what--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--because
the
third
step...
because
states
do
enact
1983
actions,
and
they
have
the
right
to
enact
a
1983
action
as
long
as
it
doesn't
discriminate
against
what
a
private
individual
would
have
to--
mr.
steven
g.
farber
--i
am
sorry,
what?
mr.
steven
g.
farber
they
could
permit
a
longer
period
or
the
same
period.
they
couldn't
go
under
what
the
personal
injury
statute
would
be,
because
you
would
have
a
situation
like
we
have
in
new
mexico,
where
someone
who
is
the
victim
of
a
simple
assault
has
three
years
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
but
someone
who
has
been
brutally
abused
by
a
police
officer
only
has
two
years
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
that
is
certainly
not
a
result,
i
think,
that
is
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
with
the
federal
interests
which
are
involved.
mr.
steven
g.
farber
yes,
i
think
that
is
unlikely.
the
action
filed
in
this
case
is
a
federal
action
filed
in
federal
court
seeking
a
federal
remedy
based
upon
a
uniquely
federal
interest,
which
is
the
protection
of
the
rights
of
citizens
through
compensation
and
deterrence,
and
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
if
for
any
reason
this
court
should
determine
that
the
limitations
provision
of
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act
should
apply
to
the
claim
of
gary
garcia,
then
we
would
ask
that
this
court
make
any
such
ruling
prospective,
because
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
in
this
case
there
had
never
been
any
kind
of
judicial
decision
which
had
ever
said
1983
actions
were
governed
by
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act.
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act
does
not
refer
to
1983
actions.
the
decisions
of
the
federal
courts
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
were
that
the
action
was
either
a
liability
based
upon
a
statute
or
an
action
for
personal
injury,
either
the
three-year
or
the
four-year
statute
of
limitations.
in
the
tenth
circuit,
it
was
the
policy
under
shaw
versus
haliburton,
which
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
if
there
was
an
arguable
difference,
that
the
longer
statute
as
a
matter
of
policy
should
be
applied.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
it
would
be
unfair
to
bar
the
claim
of
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
for
all
the
reasons
that
i
have
mentioned,
we
would
respectfully
request
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
thank
you.
