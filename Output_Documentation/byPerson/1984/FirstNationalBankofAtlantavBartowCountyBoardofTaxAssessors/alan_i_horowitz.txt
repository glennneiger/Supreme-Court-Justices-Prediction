mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
application
of
a
federal
statute,
revised
statute
3701
as
amended
in
1959,
which
exempts
federal
securities
from
state
taxation.
by
its
terms,
it
applies
to
every
form
of
taxation
that
requires
federal
obligations
to
"be
considered
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
computation
of
the
tax.
"
this
court,
in
american
bank,
characterized
the
scope
of
that
exemption
as
a
sweeping
one,
and
defined
the
words
"considered"
to
mean
included
in
the
accounting.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
proportionate
deduction
method
engrafted
onto
the
georgia
bankshares
tax
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
this
case
violates
the
express
terms
of
revised
statute
3701.
indeed,
i
do
not
see
where
the
state
explains
how
the
statute
is
to
be
interrupted
in
a
way
that
makes
their
tax
computation
lawful.
their
argument
seems
to
be
that
the
word
"considered"
cannot
mean
what
it
seems
to
mean
because
federal
obligations
would
be
considered
in
any
tax
system.
but
that's
really
not
true.
the
proposal
of
the
government,
and
of
the
appellants
here,
that
the
amount
of
federal
obligations
be
excluded
at
the
outset
of
the
tax
computation,
does
not
require
any
consideration
of
federal
obligations
at
all.
if
given
a
list
of
assets
and
liabilities
of
the
bank,
the
accountant
can
simply
add
up
all
the
taxable
assets
of
the
bank,
subtract
the
liabilities,
and
is
then
left
with
the
net
worth
figure
that
serves
as
the
tax
base
for
the
bankshares
tax.
now
the
consideration
of
the
federal
obligations
that
the
state
uses
in
this
case
is
not
a
kind
of
technicality
that
brings
it
under
the
statute.
it
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
under
the
system
of
proof
below,
the
amount
of
the
tax
increases
as
the
level
of
federal
obligations
increases.
and
to
some
extent,
this
method
undermines
the
tax
exempt
status
of
the
securities,
and
therefore
their
marketability.
in
fact,
it
seems
fairly
apparent
that
the
georgia
legislature
itself
recognized
that
a
full
exclusion
from
that
net
worth
is
the
appropriate
way
to
preserve
a
tax
exemption.
and
therefore,
conversely,
that
the
proportionate
deduction
method
used
by
the
court
here
in
fact
does
tax
the
item
in
question
to
some
degree.
by
that,
i
am
referring
to--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--in
some
cases,
if--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
true.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
they
can
get
assets
out
of
thin
air.
there
can
be
a
donation
to
capital,
for
example,
of
federal
obligations.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
true.
if
the
converse
were
true,
if
exchanging
non-federal
obligations
for
federal
obligations
would
increase
the
tax,
that
would
really
be
discriminatory.
that
would
be
putting
a
higher
tax
on
federal
obligations
than
what
is
on
other
obligations.
but
the
statute
does
not
require
that
federal
obligations
be
treated
the
same.
it
requires
that
they
be
tax
exempt
and
that
they
not
be
considered
at
all
in
computing
the
tax.
what
the
state
is
really
complaining
about
is
this
tax
exemption.
they
don't
like
the
idea
that
by
buying
federal
obligations
you're
able
to
avoid
the
tax,
but
that's
what
a
tax
exemption
is.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
oh,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
a
greater
cost
to
the
government
or
not.
the
states
have
a
lot
of
other
ways
than
possibly
raising
taxes,
and
georgia,
the
statute
that's
involved
here
has
already
been
repealed.
i
think
they
enacted
a
kind
of
an
income
tax.
and
whether
or
not
that
in
fact
results
in
a
higher
impact
on
federal
obligations
is
not
really
the
issue.
the
statute
has
prohibited
certain
kinds
of
taxes
and
allowed
certain
kinds
of
taxes.
i
suppose
that
if
congress
felt
that
a
change
in
the
franchise
taxation
was
really
having
a
substantial
effect,
they
could
amend
3701
to
take
out
the
exclusion
from
franchise
taxation.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
not
really
the
issue
here.
the
georgia
statute
has
a
special--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
we
won't
be
in
here
fighting
franchise
taxes
if
the
statute
isn't
amended.
the
statute
has
an
exclusion
for
franchise
taxes.
if
it's
taken
away,
i
don't
know
that
we'll
have
to
be
here
because
i
think
it
will
be
pretty
clear.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
know
about
that.
the
georgia
statute
has
an
exemption
for
real
estate.
the
reason
for
that...
and
real
estate
is
entitled
to
a
full
exclusion,
the
same
exclusion
we
argue
as
required
here
for
federal
taxes.
now
the
reason
for
that
exclusion
of
course
is
that
real
estate
is
taxed
separately
under
other
provisions
of
georgia
law.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
georgia
really
believed,
the
georgia
legislature
really
believed
that
their
proportionate
deduction
method
that
they
have
here
does
not
impose
any
tax
on
the
federal
obligations,
then
they
ought
to
have
the
same
proportionate
deduction
method
for
real
estate.
in
fact,
they
don't.
they
allow
full
exclusion
for
real
estate.
if
their
position
in
this
case
were
correct,
they're
really
giving
a
kind
of
an
extra
windfall
to
banks
that
hold
real
estate.
they're
allowing
them
to
shelter
other
income
with
the
real
estate.
that's
what
they
argue
is
true
with
federal
obligations,
but
it
seems
like
they
don't
really
believe
that,
because
in
fact
there
is
this
full
exclusion
for
real
estate.
i
just
point
out
that
the
state
hasn't
said
anything
about
this
in
their
brief.
i'm
not
sure
what
their
answer
to
that
is.
i
would
also
like
to
emphasize
that
this
case
is
not
really
restricted
to
the
bankshare
context.
the
state
has
made
several
arguments
about,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
banking
business,
they're
going
to
buy
federal
obligations
anyway,
and
this
case
doesn't
really
amount
to
very
much.
i
mean,
there
is
a
broad
principle
that's
involved
here,
which
is
whether
this
proportionate
deduction
method
in
fact
complies
with
the
statute
or
not.
and
if
the
state
prevails
in
this
case,
there
is
a
lot
of
opportunity
for
many
other
kinds
of
taxes,
the
treatment
of
those
taxes
to
be
changed
by
states
which
could,
first
of
all,
create
a
whole
new
host
of
problems
in
interpreting
3701
as
to
whether
various
kinds
of
proportionate
deductions
are
in
fact
valid
or
not
and
would
have
a
very
substantial
effect
on
the
marketability
of
the
united
states
securities.
probably
the
most
familiar
example
is
to
look
at
income
taxes,
either
corporate
income
taxes
or
personal
income
taxes.
many
states
have
personal
income
taxes
that
are
similar
to
the
federal
system,
where
there
is
a
computation
made
of
total
income,
and
then
deductions
are
allowed
for
certain
expenses...
mortgage
interest
expenses,
charitable
contributions,
child
care
expenses,
things
like
that.
now
it
has
always
been
understood
that
the
interest
income
on
united
states
savings
bonds
or
other
federal
securities
are
totally
excluded
from
the
computation
of
those
state
income
taxes.
but
in
fact,
under
the
position
taken
by
the
state
below,
if
that's
correct,
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
the
state
could
not
enact
the
same
sort
of
proportionate
deduction
treatment
of
interest
on
federal
bonds
for
income
taxes.
the
argument
would
go
just
as
it
does
here
that
some
portion
of
the
interest
that
is
received
by
the
taxpayer
from
the
federal
bonds
is
really
allocable
to
these
other
deductions...
interest
deductions,
child
care
deductions,
et
cetera.
so
some
of
that
has
already
been
taken
into
account,
and
therefore
they
are
only
going
to
subtract
a
portion
of
the
interest
from
federal
bonds
from
the
final
taxable
income
figure.
that
is
a
principle,
a
very
broad
application
and
that
would
have
a
substantial
impact
on
the
marketability
of
the
united
states
securities.
i
would
also
like
just
briefly
to
touch
on
this
question
of
atlas
life.
we
think
the
very
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
that
case
only
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
constitution.
this
case
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
concededly
must
go
beyond
the
constitution.
now
the
state
has
tried
to
suggest,
to
quote
one
sentence
from
this
court
that
the
statute
is
co-extensive
with
the
constitution,
but
that
obviously
can't
be
the
case
because,
if
that
were
so,
congress
wasn't
really
doing
anything
when
it
amended
the
statute
in
1959,
and
everyone
agrees
that
in
fact
they
substantially
expanded
the
scope
of
the
statute
in
1959.
finally,
i
would
also
like
to
echo
something
mr.
zink
said.
which
is,
that
part
of
the
purpose
of
congress
in
amending
the
statute
in
'59
was
to
eliminate
this
kind
of
semantical
argument
about
whether
the
tax
is
on
federal
obligations
or
whether
it
isn't.
it
leads
to
a
lot
of
litigation.
it
leads
to
a
lot
of
difficulty.
they
set
down
a
very
bright
rule
that
is
easily
applied.
if
consideration
of
federal
obligations
is
essential
to
the
computation
of
the
tax,
then
the
tax
is
invalid.
now
it
may
be
that
in
some
cases
that
tends
to
invalidate
taxes
that
do
not
seem
necessarily
unfair
on
their
face,
but
that
is
a
consequence
of
the
tax
exemption.
that
is
something
that
is
within
the
power
of
congress
to
enact,
and
that
is
what
they
have
done
here.
