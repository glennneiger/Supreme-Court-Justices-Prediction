justice
rehnquist
well
there,
mr.
zink,
there
was
an
actual
discrimination,
wasn't
there,
in
the
idaho
situation
against
the
federal
obligations?
justice
rehnquist
well,
now,
do
you
think
it
was
the
secretary's
feeling
there
that
there
was
an
element
of
unfair
treatment,
differential
treatment
between
federal
obligations
and
other
obligations?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
is
true
about
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
done
here
that
the
georgia
formula
does
not
discriminate
against
federal
obligations?
justice
rehnquist
you
will
cheerfully
acquiesce?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
percent
would
you
say
remains
subject
under
c&s's
example?
