mr.
charles
t.
zink
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
conflict
between
the
state
taxing
law
and
a
federal
statute
limiting
state
taxation.
georgia
had
a
bank
share
tax,
which
was
measured
by
net
worth.
the
federal
law
revised
at
statutes,
section
3701,
limits
the
state
taxation
in
federal
obligations.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
taxing
formula
adopted
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
considers
or
takes
into
account
federal
obligations
in
violation
of
section
3701.
this
case
is
making
its
second
appearance
before
the
courts.
in
1980,
the
bank
deducted
federal
obligations
from
its
net
worth.
the
georgia
supreme
court
denied
any
deduction
for
the
obligations.
while
that
case
was
pending
here,
this
court
decided
the
case
of
american
bank
and
trust
company
against
dallas
county
in
1983.
in
american
bank,
the
court
decided
that
the
amendment
to
section
3701
that
was
enacted
in
1959
required
that
there
be
a
deduction
of
federal
obligations.
consequently,
the
court
remanded
this
case
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
american
bank.
on
remand,
the
bank
urged
the
georgia
supreme
court
that
it
be
permitted
to
take
a
complete
exclusion
of
the
federal
obligations.
it
urged
that
what
the
statute
meant
was
that
these
be
ignored
and
treated
as
nonexistent.
instead,
the
georgia
supreme
court
construed
the
georgia
bank
share
tax
to
require
only
a
proportionate
deduction.
it
devised
a
formula,
and
that
is
set
forth
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
whereby
the
percentage
of
federal
obligations
to
total
assets
was
determined.
and
in
the
example
given,
that
was
9.75
percent.
it
then
determined
that
only
9.75
percent
of
the
bank's
federal
obligations
were
present
in
its
net
worth,
and
its
formula
would
permit
a
deduction
of
only
that
amount,
some
$200,000.
thus,
the
formula
adopted
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
had
the
effect
of
reducing
the
deductions
for
federal
obligations
by
a
factor
of
almost
10
from
approximately
$2
million
to
$200,000.
because
the
taxing
formula
did
not
exclude
or
ignore
federal
obligations,
but
instead
considered
them
and
took
them
into
account
in
the
computation
of
the
tax,
the
bank
appealed
the
decision
to
this
court.
we
feel
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
for
at
least
three
reasons.
the
plain
meaning
of
section
3701
requires
a
complete
and
not
a
limited
exclusion
of
federal
obligations.
it
requires
that
they
be
treated
as
nonexistent.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
shows
that
congress
intended
for
there
to
be
a
complete
exclusion,
and
the
rationale
of
the
court
below,
if
permitted
to
stand,
would
limit
the
protection
for
exempt
obligations
provided
by
the
statute
for
all
taxpayers
and
for
all
types
of
taxes
in
clear
violation
of
the
statute.
now
the
language
of
section
3701
reflects
its
purpose:
to
make
federal
obligations
tax
free
as
far
as
state
taxes
are
concerned.
the
idea
is
that
an
individual,
a
corporation,
or
a
bank
can
purchase
federal
obligations
and
know
that
the
purchase
will
not
be
affected
by
state
taxes
in
any
way.
the
georgia
formula,
by
contrast,
if
there's
a
contribution
of
federal
obligations
to
capital,
or
if
a
bank
purchases
federal
obligations
from
earnings,
the
tax
increases.
now
those
consequences
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
in
american
bank,
the
court
determined
that
the
exemption
contained
in
the
statute
as
amended
was
sweeping.
the
court
went
on
in
that
case
to
hold
that
the
statute
did
away
with
the
inquiry
to
whether
the
tax
was
on
an
asset,
and
replaced
it
with
the
inquiry
whether
the
obligations
are
considered
in
the
computation
of
the
tax.
the
court
said
in
american
bank
that
"considered"
for
this
purpose
means
"taken
into
account"
or
"included
in
the
accounting".
within
that
framework,
i
would
like
to
examine
what
the
majority
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
did
in
its
formula.
it
added
in
the
value
of
the
bank's
federal
obligations
in
computing
total
assets.
it
took
them
into
account
a
second
time
as
the
numerator
of
the
fraction
used
to
determine
the
portion.
and
they
were
taken
into
account
a
third
time
as
a
component
of
net
work
to
which
the
fraction
was
applied.
by
the
time
the
georgia
supreme
court
got
to
deducting
the
federal
obligations
from
the
tax
base,
90
percent
of
the
federal
obligations
had
disappeared,
and
they
permitted
only
a
deduction
for
10
percent.
we
submit
that
the
formula
clearly
takes
into
account,
at
least
indirectly,
the
federal
obligations
that
constitute
a
part
of
the
bank's
assets,
a
procedure
which
this
court
held
in
american
bank
is
impermissible.
we
respectfully
submit
that
you
avoid
consideration
of
federal
obligations
only
when
you
exclude
them
or
threat
them
as
nonexistent,
and
that
the
states
must
exclude
them
from
total
assets
before
determining
net
assets
and
taxing
net
worth.
now
the
legislative
history
shows
that
this
is
exactly
what
congress
intended.
the
taxing
authorities
have
suggested
that
our
method
of
taking
them
off
the
top
and
ignoring
the
obligations
is
itself
a
consideration,
but
clearly
that
is
not
the
case.
as
shown
in
the
secretary
of
the
treasury's
report
in
the
house
hearings
and
in
the
senate
finance
committee's
report,
one
impetus
to
the
amendment
to
the
statute
in
1959
was
the
fact
that
idaho
had
a
tax,
the
1933
idaho
taxing
act,
which
included
exempt
income
from
federal
obligations
in
gross
income.
now
the
secretary
noted
at
page
70
of
the
hearings
that
idaho
did
purport
to
take
the
exempt
income
out
of
the
net
income.
clearly
there
was
no
complete
deduction,
because
if
a
full
deduction
were
present
from
that
formula,
neither
the
secretary
nor
the
congress
would
have
been
concerned.
mr.
charles
t.
zink
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
so.
it
was
a
peculiar...
they
included...
they
defined
gross
income
to
include
what
is
normally
exempt
income.
they
expressly
included
federal
obligations,
income
from
federal
obligations
in
gross
income.
then
there
was
another
statute,
or
section
in
that
taxing
formula
that
said,
well,
to
the
extent
that
we
can't
include
exempt
income
in
your
income,
then
you
will
lose
a
proportional
part
of
your
deductions
against
income
based
on
the
percentage
of
your
exempt
income
to
total
income.
mr.
charles
t.
zink
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
that
was
the
problem,
because
i
think
they
treated
all
exempt
income
the
same
way.
the
problem
that
the
secretary
had,
as
i
read
his
report,
is
that
here
again
we
have
got
a
statute,
and
the
states
are
coming
up
with
these
arcane
formulas
that
are
indirect
attempts
to
limit
the
effectiveness
of
the
statute.
we
have
got
to
do
something
to
beef
up
the
statute
to
keep
this
from
happening.
mr.
charles
t.
zink
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
it
discriminates;
i
just
think
it
violates
the
statute.
mr.
charles
t.
zink
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
you
can
come
up
with
various
formulas
that
indirectly
tax
federal
obligations,
and
we
feel
that
congress
in
very
plain
language
in
1959
said
we're
not
going
to
let
that
happen
any
more.
these...
neither
the
obligations
nor
the
income
will
be
considered
in
any
form
of
tax
that
considers
the
obligations
or
the
income
in
the
computation
of
the
tax.
it
was
to
do
away
with
these
various
formulas
that
were
designed
to
try
to
limit
the
effectiveness
of
the--
mr.
charles
t.
zink
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
what
idaho
was
trying
to
do
to
gross
income,
that
it's
clear
that
what
the
secretary
and
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
amendment
of
1959
was
to
take
the
exempt
income
in
that
case
off
of
gross,
and
that's
what
they
wanted
to
do.
we
think
that
they
envisioned
that
the
words
of
the
amending
statute
would
have
that
effect.
now
if
that
same
result
followed
here,
the
federal
obligations
would
be
excluded
from
gross
assets
before
any
computations
of
a
net
tax
base.
now
this
court
has,
on
at
least
one
occasion,
determined
that
a
proportionate
deduction
is
insufficient
to
remove
an
asset
from
a
tax
base.
in
schuylkill
trust
company
against
pennsylvania,
decided
in
1935,
the
court
ruled
without
elaboration
that
a
proportional
deduction
was
insufficient
to
remove
shares
of
a
national
bank
from
the
net
worth
tax
base.
mr.
charles
t.
zink
they
could,
your
honor.
of
course
franchise
taxes
are
one
of
the
exemptions
provided
in
3701
whereby
the
states
can
tax
federal
obligations.
but
of
course
if
they
don't
tax
federal
obligations,
as
for
example
georgia's
does
not
in
its
new
tax
act,
then
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
franchise
taxes.
in
other
words,
a
regular
income
tax
which,
as
you
know
now
that
the
banking
law
was
changed
in
1969
to
permit
banks
to
be
taxed
in
more
typical
ways,
lots
of
states
are
going
just
to
a
typical
corporate
income
tax
and
are
not
trying
to
tax
federal
obligations
in
that
context.
although
the
taxing
authorities
seek
support
for
their
position,
in
this
court's
opinion
in
atlas
life,
united
states
against
atlas
life
insurance
company,
the
cases
are
wholly
distinct.
atlas
life
involved
the
destruction
of
the
life
insurance
company
tax
act
of
1959.
in
that
act,
congress
imposed
a
tax
on
life
insurance
companies
and
allocated
income
from
municipal
securities
on
two
accounts,
the
policyholder's
account
and
the
company's
account.
the
act
stated
that
the
policyholder's
account
was
not
taxed,
and
it
permitted
a
deduction
from
the
company's
account.
the
court
held
in
atlas
life
that
that
allocation
by
congress
was
rot
unconstitutional.
now
the
most
obvious
differences
between
atlas
life
and
this
case
are,
one,
atlas
life
involved
the
validity
of
a
congressional
statute
in
light
of
the
constitution.
and
this
case,
by
contrast,
involves
the
validity
of
a
state-adopted
taxing
formula
in
light
of
a
very
specific
congressional
statute.
the
prohibition--
mr.
charles
t.
zink
--yes,
sir,
but
not
in
the
net
worth
context.
of
course
atlas
was
not
a
net
worth
case.
mr.
charles
t.
zink
i
think
that...
yes,
sir,
i
think
the...
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
said
that
this
allocation
does
not
violate
the
constitution,
and
it
was
in
a
sense
a
proportionate
allocation.
mr.
charles
t.
zink
it
makes
this
case,
your
honor.
i
think
the
combination
of
section
3701
as
amended
in
1959,
and
american
bank,
i
think
i
could
have
stood
up
and
said
those
two
things
and
sat
down.
the
prohibition
in
the
statute,
section
3701,
is
very
direct,
explicit,
and
as
this
court
determined
in
american
bank,
sweeping.
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
taxation
is
implied.
atlas
life
involved
the
question
of
whether
the
tax
was
on
the
asset,
and
that's
the
very
test
which
this
court
held
in
atlas
life...
i'm
sorry,
in
american
bank,
not
to
be
appropriate
in
construing
section
3701.
finally,
the
taxing
scheme
in
atlas
life
was
found
by
the
court
not
to
wholly
ignore
federal
exempt
income.
and
that
is
what
is
required
in
connection
with
3701.
now
the
states
cannot
create
formulas
that
limit
the
exemption.
section
3701
is
not
limited
to
banks,
or
to
shares
of
banks;
it
protects
federal
obligations
from
taxation
of
any
type
and
for
all
types
of
taxpayers.
the
consequences
of
the
georgia
supreme
court's
error
can
go
far
beyond
this
bank
and
banks
generally.
the
rationale,
for
example,
would
permit
a
proportionate
offset
of
expenses
against
exempt
income.
now
that
would
clearly
violate
the
statute.
the
court
said
in
american
bank
that
section
3701,
as
amended,
is
inconsistent
with
implied
exceptions.
as
shown
in
the
examples
in
the
bank's
brief,
some
states
have
adopted
formulas
that
provide
less
than
the
complete
deduction
of
federal
obligations
from
the
tax
base.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
simply
a
replay
of
the
idaho
type
problem
which
congress
faced
in
1959
when
it
amended
the
statute.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
for
this
court
to
have
to
evaluate
each
of
these
formulas
on
an
individual
basis.
we
feel
that
congress
intended
in
1959
to
stop
the
use
of
these
formulas,
and
to
deny
the
effectiveness
of
the
exemption,
and
we
feel
that
it
did
so
in
very
plain
and
unmistakable
words.
in
short,
we
feel
that
any
additional
exceptions
to
section
3701
should
be
adopted
by
congress
and
not
by
the
states,
and
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
t.
zink
if
it
please
the
court,
briefly:
the
first
point,
the
state
taxing
authorities
have
said
that
a
partial...
and
they've
said
this
in
the
context
of
the
attractiveness
of
purchasing
federal
obligations...
but
they've
said
that
a
partial
deduction
of
federal
obligations
on
infinite
purchases
is
a
better
deal
than
a
flat
deduction
on
the
front.
now
while
they
make
that
argument
for
the
attractiveness
purpose,
they
have
effectively
conceded
that
the
georgia
formula
is
not
only
on
the
obligation,
but
considers
it.
because
if
it
didn't,
it
would
not
be
any
different
in
economic
impact.
in
short,
i
think
if
you
example
that
argument
they've
made,
you'll
see
that
georgia's
formula
is
not
tax
neutral,
and
it
is
supposed
to
be.
separately,
the
state
taxing
authorities
have
said
that
federal
obligations
are
allocated
to
a
nontaxable
liability
account.
that's
an
attempt...
and
i
don't
blame
them...
to
wrap
their
case
in
atlas
life,
congress
and
atlas
life
said
this
account
is
nontaxable,
and
that
one
is
not.
liabilities
are
not...
there's
no
allocation
to
a
liability
account.
what
they're
doing
is
using
liabilities
to
offset
and
reduce
the
amount
of
federal
obligations
by
liabilities
that,
in
some
cases,
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
obligation.
for
example,
one
of
the
liabilities
is
an
obligation
in
accrual
for
state
tax
liability.
now
i
ask
you,
how
can
that
be
a
proper
offset
to
federal
obligations?
the
state
taxing
authorities
have
said,
and
been
concerned
about
a
double
deduction.
this
is
not
a
double
deduction
case.
we
don't
care
about
a
double
deduction.
we
just
don't
want
to
be
taxed
in
contravention
of
the
congressional
statute.
in
my
example
that
i
gave
of
a
contribution
of
federal
obligations
to
capital,
there
is
no
sheltering
effect
at
all.
justice
stevens
talked
about
the
conversion
of
a
taxable
asset
to
a
nontaxable
asset,
and
that
would
be
true
if
you've
already
had
the
asset
on
tax
day.
but
if
you
earned
a
dollar
during
the
year
and
before
tax
day
used
that
dollar
to
buy
a
federal
obligation
under
the
georgia
formula,
your
tax
goes
up.
we
don't
think
that
can
be
read
to
reconcile
with
the
statute.
finally,
the
taxing
authorities
have
said
that
if
we
can
trace
the
source
of
funds
by
which
we
purchase
federal
obligations,
that
they
might
give
us
a
deduction.
first,
in
the
operations
of
a
bank
there
is
money
coming
in
and
out
every
day.
it's
a
physical
impossibility.
second,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
conditions
the
exemption
given
by
congress
on
that
type
of
burden,
where
you
would
actually
have
