ms.
grace
p.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
we
basically
agree
with
the
facts
as
presented,
we
would
like
to
emphasize
certain
additional
facts
in
this
case.
the
georgia
bank
share
tax
is
not
measured
by
gross
assets.
instead,
those
assets
which
were
purchased
with
liability
funds
are
completely
removed
from
the
measure
of
the
tax.
the
tax
is
only
measured
by
those
assets
which
were
purchased
by
net
worth
funds.
it
is
simply
incorrect
to
say
that
georgia's
method
only
removes
a
portion
of
federal
obligations
from
the
tax.
instead,
georgia's
method
fully
removes
all
federal
obligation
values
from
the
computation
of
the
tax,
and
it
does
so
in
this
manner:
georgia's
method
reasonably
attributes
a
portion
of
federal
obligation
values
to
liabilities,
and
it
reasonably
attributes
a
portion
of
federal
obligation
values
to
net
worth.
and
then
it
removes
from
both
accounts
federal
obligation
values.
for
example--
ms.
grace
p.
evans
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
ms.
grace
p.
evans
if
the
bank
owned
no
federal
obligations
at
all,
they
would
be
entitled
to
no
deduction.
but
in
this
case,
for
example
in
the
case
of
c&s
bank
that
was
used
in
the
georgia
supreme
court's
example,
there
was
a
deduction
of
$200,000
of
federal
obligations
that
were
attributed
to
the
net
worth
account,
but
there
was
also
attributed
to
the
liability
account
approximately
$1,700,000
of
federal
obligation
value.
and
the
total
of
the
federal
obligation
values
that
were
attributed
to
the
liability
account,
and
the
total
that
were
attributed
to
the
net
worth
account,
equal
all
federal
obligation
values.
and
as
a
result,
all
federal
obligation
values
were
removed
from
the
measure
of
the
tax.
first
atlanta's
method,
on
the
other
hand,
would
create
a
double
deduction.
what
first
atlanta
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
deduct
all
federal
obligation
values
one
fine
from
gross
assets,
and
then
to
deduct
those
federal
obligation
values
which
were
purchased
with
funds
from
liabilities
a
second
time.
and
in
doing
so,
it
creates
a
deduction
which
is
greatly
in
excess
of
federal
obligation
values
that
are
actually
represented
in
the
adjusted
tax
base.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed
for
three
reasons.
it
should
be
affirmed
because
georgia's
method
fully
complies
with
section
3701
by
removing
federal
obligation
values
in
full
from
the
computation
of
the
tax,
and
it
does
so
without
sheltering
otherwise
taxable
assets.
georgia's
method
is
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
georgia's
method
effectuates
the
intent
of
congress.
georgia's
method
fully
complies
with
section
3701.
section
3701
requires
that
federal
obligation
values
be
excluded
from
the
computation
of
the
tax.
as
i
previously
pointed
out,
georgia's
method
presumes
that
a
portion
of
federal
obligation
values
are
represented
in
net
worth,
and
a
portion
are
represented
in
liabilities.
i
remind
the
court
that
before
reaching
the
measure...
before
reaching
the
tax
base,
that
already
90
percent
of
assets
have
been
removed,
and
georgia
is
attributing
a
portion
of
those
federal
obligation
values
to
those
assets.
so,
for
example,
georgia
says
that
if
9.75
percent
of
federal
obligations
are
represented
in
total
assets,
then
9.75
are
represented
in
net
worth
and
in
the
liability
account.
and
georgia's
method
is
one
which
is
reasonable,
and
it's
legitimate.
it
is
one
that
is
recognized
by
both
bankers
and
bank
regulators.
for
example,
the
bank
administration
institute
recognizes
that
banks
have
on
this
side
of
the
balance
sheet
liabilities
and
net
worth,
and
they
have
a
pool
of
funds
which
they
can
use
to
invest
in
assets.
and
these
pool
of
funds
are
co-mingled.
what
they
do
is,
since
they
don't
know
which
fund
was
used
to
purchase
which
asset,
they
presume
that
a
portion
of
each
and
every
fund
is
invested
in
each
and
every
asset.
this
is
the
formula
that
they
use
in
their
cost
analysis.
the
federal
reserve
board
does
the
same
thing
in
their
cost
analysis.
georgia
has
simply
adopted
that
concept,
and
has
attempted
to
accord
federal
obligations
full
tax-exempt
status
in
a
reasonable
manner.
they
do
so,
and
the
formula
is
not
inflexible.
this
formula
is
to
be
used
only
when
a
bank
cannot
demonstrate
where
their
federal
obligation
values
were
purchased
from.
if
appellant,
of
any
bank,
can
come
in
and
demonstrate
that
greater
federal
obligation
values
are
present
in
net
worth,
the
georgia
court
has
said,
we
will
make
an
appropriate
adjustment.
it
is
the
intent
of
georgia
to
fully
accord
tax-exempt
status
to
these
federal
obligations.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
pro-rata
method
is
equitable
to
a
fault;
that
it
really
allocates
to
net
worth
a
greater
portion
of
federal
obligation
values
than
area
actually
present
in
net
worth.
prudent
banking
practices
would
dictate
that
liability
funds,
those
funds
which
include
deposits,
would
be
used...
and
these
are
very
volatile
sources,
and
have
to
be
available
for
potential
withdrawal
demand...
that
those
funds
would
more
than
likely
be
used
to
invest
in
federal
obligations,
because
they
can
be
quickly
sold
and
turned
over.
on
the
other
hand,
net
worth
is
not
volatile.
it's
the
most
stable
of
all
the
bank's
assets.
and
as
a
result,
those
funds
can
be
invested
in
longer
yielding
assets
which
don't
require
a
quick
turnaround
for
withdrawal
demands,
because
there
are
none,
and
are
generally
invested
in
bank
premises
in
higher
yielding
assets.
first
atlanta's
method,
on
the
other
hand,
is
irrational,
yet
is
not
required
by
section
3701,
and
it
distorts
the
intent
of
the
congress.
it
is
irrational
because
what
first
atlanta
is
saying
to
this
court
and
asking
this
court
to
accept
is
this:
it
is
asking
the
court
to
create
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
all
federal
obligation
values
are
present
in
net
worth,
a
presumption
which
simply
has
no
basis
in
reality.
first
atlanta
doesn't
attempt
to
show
that
it
has
a
basis
in
reality.
they
just
say,
if
we're
going
to
remove
federal
obligations
from
the
tax
base
and
we
don't
know
if
they
were
purchased
from
liabilities
and
we
don't
know
if
they
were
purchased
from
net
worth,
in
effect
they're
saying
let's
just
pretend
that
they
are
present
in
net
worth
because
we
know
if
we
remove
it
there
that
they'll
be
completely
gone.
well,
we
could
as
easily
pretend
that
they
were
all
present
in
liabilities;
because
we
recognize
that
those
federal
obligations
which
were
purchased
with
liabilities
are
already
excluded,
and
are
never
excluded
in
georgia's
tax
base.
so
it
could
be
accomplished
in
that
way.
but
instead,
georgia
has
tried
to
fairly
allocate
that
portion
of
federal
obligations
which
would
be
represented
in
the
liability
account,
and
that
portion
which
would
be
represented
in
the
net
worth
account.
in
effect,
what
first
atlanta
is
saying
is
that,
as
justice
stone
noted
in
missouri
v.
gehner,
that
tax
exempt
also
means
debt
exempt.
first
atlanta
is
saying
that
federal
obligations
would
not
be
subject
to
any
liabilities,
and
that
simply
is
not
the
case
in
banking
practices.
first
atlanta's
method
is
not
required
by
section
3701.
it
creates
a
double
deduction,
and
it
affords
a
tax
shelter.
it
creates
a
double
deduction
because
it
removes
from
total
assets
all
federal
obligation
values.
and
then
when
those
liability
funds
which
were
used
to
purchase
those
federal
obligation
values
are
removed,
then
those
federal
obligation
values
are
removed
a
second
time.
and
as
a
result,
first
atlanta's
method
deducts
federal
obligation
values
which
far
exceed
the
amount
of
federal
obligation
values
which
are
present
in
net
worth,
and
it
does
so
at
the
expense
of
the
taxing
power
of
the
state
to
tax
those
assets
which
are
proper
subjects
of
state
and
local
taxation.
first
atlanta's
method
also
distorts
the
intent
of
congress.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
american
bank
and
trust
company,
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
in
1959
to
section
3701
was
to
extend
the
reach
of
the
immunity
to
taxes
which
previously
had
not
been
included.
that
is,
indirect
taxes
such
as
bankshare
taxes.
it
is
not
correct,
as
appellant
argues,
that
iowa...
that
the
legislative
history
would
indicate
that
federal
obligations
must
be
removed
from
gross
assets.
instead,
the
problem
in
idaho...
i
believe
it
was
idaho,
was
that
they
were
attempting
to
tax
federal
obligation
values
indirectly
by
saying,
we
are
not
really
imposing
a
tax
on
the
federal
obligation
values;
instead,
we
are
imposing
it
on
income.
and
they
made
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
remove
federal
obligation
values
from
the
computation
of
the
tax.
first
atlanta's
method
distorts
the
intent
of
congress
because
this
double
deduction
has
the
effect
of
exaggerating
the
immunity
from
taxation
into
a
total
exemption
from
taxation.
it
would
have
the
effect
of
wiping
out
bankshare
taxes
as
a
feasible
revenue
measure
for
the
states.
this
is
so
because
virtually
all
banks
in
the
united
states
possess
sufficient
federal
obligations
to
wipe
out
their
bankshare
tax
liability.
we
submit
that
such
a
radical
change
cannot
be
attributed
to
congress
to
eliminate
a
revenue
measure
which
at
that
time
was
being
used
by
a
majority
of
the
states
and,
at
that
time,
banks
in
those
states
owned
enough
federal
obligations
to
wipe
out
their
bankshare
tax
liability.
that
such
a
sharp
change
in
existing
state
law
cannot
be
attributed
to
congress
absent
the
clearest
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
purpose,
and
there
is
no
such
indication
in
the
legislative
history.
georgia's
method
is
also
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
in
united
states
v.
atlas
life
insurance
company,
this
court
in
1965
recognized
that
a
pro
rata
deduction
similar
to
one
that
is
being
used
by
the
georgia
court
did
not
violate
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
taxation
of
state
and
municipal
bonds.
in
atlas
life,
the
court
was
confronted
with
a
similar
problem
that
the
court
is
confronted
with
today.
that
is,
how
to
remove
tax
exempt
interest
without,
at
the
same
time,
sheltering
taxable
assets.
they
had,
like
georgia
has,
a
tax...
in
that
case
there
was
a
tax
on
investment
income,
but
a
portion
of
that
investment
income
was
excluded.
and
that
portion
that
was
attributed
to
the
policyholder's
share
was
excluded.
well,
in
the
same
case,
georgia
excludes
that
portion
of
assets
that
are
attributed
to
liabilities.
in
atlas
life,
the
portion
that
was
attributed
to
the
company
was
included
in...
was
taxed.
in
that
case,
the
insurance
company
argued,
the
only
way
that
we're
going
to
be
able
to
remove
tax-exempt
interest
is
to
take
it
all
from
the
company
share,
just
like
first
atlanta
saying
to
the
court
today
that
the
only
way
to
remove
tax-exempt
interest
is
to
remove
it
from
the
net
worth
portion
of
those
assets
attributed
to
net
worth.
but
the
court
rejected
that.
they
said,
there
is
no
sound
reason
to
believe
that
all
tax
exempt
interest
is
attributed
to
the
company's
share.
instead,
a
portion
of
that
tax
exempt
interest
is
also
attributed
to
the
policyholder's
share.
and
they
said
that
a
pro
rata
method
reasonably
and
fairly
removed
tax
exempt
interest
without
sheltering
assets
which
were
proper
subjects
of
taxation.
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
court
looked
at
the
extensive
legislative
history,
and
they
noted
that
it
was
the
conclusion
of
congress
that
a
pro
rata
method
did
not
impose
any
tax
at
all
on
exempt
values.
the
department
of
the
treasury
came
and
testified
before
senate
committee
hearings
and
stated
that
the
formula
provided
by
the
senate
bill
did
not
place
a
tax
on
tax
exempt
interest.
senator
byrd
stated
to
the
senate
committee:
in
providing
the
formula
i
have
described
to
the
senate,
it
was
the
intention
of
the
committee
not
to
impose
any
tax
on
tax
exempt
interest.
therefore,
the
court
concluded
that
a
pro
rata
method
which
was
similar
to
the
method
used
by
georgia
fully
complied
with
the
requirement
that
the
tax
exempt
interest
be
removed.
in
addition,
georgia's
method
effectuates
the
intent
of
congress.
as
i
previously
indicated,
in
1959
when
congress
amended
the
statute,
the
purpose
of
that
amendment
was
to
extend
the
immunity
to
forms
of
taxation
which
had
not
previously
been
included.
it
is
more
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress
was
familiar
with
and
approved
the
pro
rata
method
of
recognizing
exemptions
upheld
in
atlas
life.
this
is
because,
at
the
time
the
income
tax
act
was
being
considered
in
1959,
the
amendment
to
section
3701
was
also
being
considered.
there
was
a
three
month
difference
in
their
enactment.
and
as
a
result,
congress'
findings
and
intent
respecting
pro
rata
allocation
methods
are
particularly
appropriate
to
understanding
what
congress
expected
section
3701
to
accomplish.
first
atlanta
would
attribute
to
these
same
legislators
a
conclusion
that
states
must
be
barred
from
employing
pro
rata
methods,
and
we
submit
that
such
a
stunning
change
in
position
cannot
be
attributed
to
congress
absent
the
clearest
indication
in
the
legislative
history.
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
that
georgia's
method
would
increase
the
cost
of
federal
borrowing.
we
submit,
as
opposed
to
first
atlanta's
method,
that
georgia's
method
would
have
the
opposite
result.
that,
if
anything,
that
it
would
tend
to
decrease
the
cost
of
federal
borrowing.
the
solicitor
general's
prediction
is
unsupported
in
the
record,
and
it
is
based
on
a
false
premise.
the
solicitor
general
misunderstood
and
thought
that
georgia
was
only
excluding
a
portion
of
tax
exempt
values,
and
states
that
90
percent,
for
example
in
the
c&s
example,
that
90
percent
of
those
federal
obligations
remained
subject
to
the
tax.
that
simply
is
not
correct.
under
first
atlanta's
method,
the--
ms.
grace
p.
evans
--under
c&s's
example,
all
federal
obligation
values
are
removed
from
the
tax.
this
is
because
$200,000
is
removed
from
the
net
worth
portion,
and
approximately
$1,700,000
is
removed
when
liabilities
are
deducted
from
total
assets.
there
are
two
deductions
that
go
on
here.
one
is
when
liabilities
are
removed
from
total
assets.
and
then
once
you
do
that,
you
have
net
worth.
then
georgia
removes
from
net
worth
an
additional
portion.
but
it
removes
that
portion
which
can
be
reasonably
attributed
to
net
worth.
and
it
also
attributes
the
same
portion
to
liabilities.
ms.
grace
p.
evans
c&s
in
its
brief
stated
that
it
was
the
largest
bank
in
georgia.
ms.
grace
p.
evans
your
honor,
i
hesitate
to
speak
for
c&s,
but
i
would
imagine...
and
as
they
pointed
out
in
their
brief...
that
c&s
views
the
pro
rata
method
as
a
fair
method
of
fully
excluding
tax
exempt
values
from
the
tax
base.
ms.
grace
p.
evans
well,
we
would
also
point
out,
your
honor,
that
the
pennsylvania
bankers
association
also
endorses
georgia's
method
and
recognizes
that
this
method
is
a
fair
method
of
removing
in
full
federal
obligation
values
without
sheltering
taxable
assets.
the
real
problem
with
first
atlanta's
position
is
that
it
does
accord
a
double
deduction,
and
it
has
the
effect
of
reducing,
or
deducting
federal
obligations
far
in
excess
of
those
values
that
are
present
in
net
worth.
ms.
grace
p.
evans
yes.
ms.
grace
p.
evans
well--
ms.
grace
p.
evans
--well,
now,
the
statute
says
that
federal
obligations
cannot
be
considered
in
the
computation
of
the
tax.
ms.
grace
p.
evans
and
this
court
defined
"considered"
to
mean
"included
in
the
accounting".
georgia's
method
excludes--
ms.

evans
--from
the
computation
of
the
tax--
ms.
grace
p.
evans
--that's
correct,
because
they
are
not
included
in
the
accounting,
in
the
computation
of
the
tax.
they
are
excluded
from
the
computation
of
the
tax.
ms.

evans
we
submit
that
georgia's
method
would,
if
anything,
decrease
the
cost
of
federal
borrowing.
that
is
because
of
this
reason.
as
i
indicated,
virtually
all
banks
in
the
united
states
possess
sufficient
amounts
of
federal
obligations
to
wipe
out
their
bankshare
tax
liability.
as
a
result,
there's
no
incentive
for
them
to
purchase
more
federal
obligation
values.
to
the
extent
that
their
decision
to
buy
federal
obligations
is
influenced
by
a
bank
tax
deduction,
that
incentive
is
removed.
it
is
no
longer
there
any
more.
however,
georgia's
method
continues
to
have
incentive,
because
for
every
marginal...
for
every
additional
purchase
of
federal
obligation
values,
there's
also
a
marginal
tax
benefit
as
well.
to
summarize,
we
submit
that
the
principle
governing
this
case
was
understood
by
justices
stone,
brandeis,
and
holmes
in
1939
in
their
dissent
in
missouri
v.
gehner.
it
was
understood
by
the
entire
court
in
1965
in
united
states
v.
atlas
life
insurance
company.
first
atlanta
today
is
asking
this
court
to
unlearn
the
proper
analysis,
or
to
fail
to
apply
the
proper
analysis.
we
submit
that
because
georgia's
method
fully
complies
with
section
3701
by
removing
in
full
federal
obligation
values
from
the
computation
of
the
tax
without
sheltering
taxable
assets,
and
that
because
georgia's
method
is
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
with
the
intent
of
congress,
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
thank
you.
