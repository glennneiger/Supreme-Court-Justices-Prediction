mr.
zink,
does
that
mean
that
any
time
a
bank
had
federal
bonds
of
a
value
greater
than
the
bank's
net
worth,
there
could
be
no
net
worth
tax
obligation?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt?
i'm
just
trying
to
think.
you
say
the
tax
goes
up
as
the
amount
of
federal
obligations
goes
up?
justice
stevens
it
wouldn't
if
they
sold
off
non-federal
and
exchanged
it
for
federal;
then
it
would
go
down,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
they
don't
just
get
assets
out
of
thin
air.
they've
got
to
sell
what
they
have
in
order
to
buy
federal
obligations.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
if
you
just
started
with
a
given
balance
sheet,
and
then
buy
or
sell
what
you
have
got,
the
more
federal
obligations
you
buy,
the
lower
your
taxes.
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
your
computations?
justice
stevens
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
do
is
you
figure
out
this
ratio
and
take
the
percentage
out
of
net
worth.
then
you
say
you
are
really
taking
all
the
federal
obligations
off
the
assets
side
of
the
balance
sheet,
because
you
subtract
the
net
worth
figure
from
the
value
of
the
federal
obligations,
and
you
get
$1.7
million,
or
whatever
it
is,
which
is
your
liability
portion,
and
you
take
that
off.
am
i
describing
it
right?
in
other
words,
you
take
that
sum
off
of
both
sides
of
the
balance
sheet?
justice
stevens
but
if
i
am
right
on
what
you
said,
i
don't
know
how
that
squares
with
the
language
of
the
statute
that
says
you
don't
consider
the
amount
of
federal
obligations.
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
use
them
in
order
to
get
the
liability
figure
you
take
out.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
so
you're
saying
that's
not
considering
it
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
