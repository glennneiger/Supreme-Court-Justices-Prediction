mr.
zink,
if
we
follow
your
position
here,
do
you
think
the
states
will
be
given
the
franchise
taxes
at
greater
cost
to
the
banks?
justice
blackmun
well,
at
least
proportionality
was
upheld
in
atlas
life,
wasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
well,
the
cases
are
different,
but
at
least
it
indicates
a
proportionality
approach.
justice
blackmun
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
do
you
think
that
the
case
that
we
had,
american
bank
and
trust
company
against
dallas
county,
helps
you
or
hurts
you
in
your
case?
justice
blackmun
mr.
horowitz,
i'll
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
zink.
if
your
view
prevails,
aren't
you
driving
the
states
into
franchise
taxation
at
greater
cost,
really,
to
the
government?
justice
blackmun
well,
it
may
not
be
the
issue,
but
i
think
it
is
a
practical
effect.
maybe
you
will
be
in
here
fighting
franchise
taxes.
justice
blackmun
ms.
evans,
which
is
the
larger
of
the
two
banks,
c&s,
or
first
atlanta?
justice
blackmun
can
you
spell
out
for
me...
maybe
you
already
have,
but
would
you
do
it
again
if
you
have...
why
c&s
is
on
one
side
of
this
case
as
an
amicus
on
the
other
side
of
this
of
this
case
from
first
atlanta?
justice
blackmun
well,
it
is
rather
unusual,
isn't
it,
where
perhaps
the
two
largest
banks
in
georgia,
i
don't
know
whether
that
is
so,
but
anyway,
two
substantial
banks
are
taking
opposite
positions
on
this
rather
vital
banking
case?
