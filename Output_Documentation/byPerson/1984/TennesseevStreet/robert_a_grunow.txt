mr.
robert
a.
grunow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
criminal
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
which
reversed
defendant
street's
first
degree
murder
conviction
and
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
a
nontestifying
accomplice's
confession
can
be
constitutionally
used
on
rebuttal
to
impeach
the
defendant's
claim
that
his
own
confession
was
a
coerced
imitation
of
the
accomplice's.
the
facts
relevant
to
this
inquiry
are
as
follows:
this
prosecution
arises
out
of
the
1981
murder
of
a
72
year
old
man
who
was
found
hanged
outside
his
burglarized
home
in
a
small
mountain
community
in
east
tennessee.
the
defendant,
a
clifford
peele,
and
five
other
young
adults,
were
charged
with
murder,
and
defendant
street's
case
was
severed
from
the
others.
the
state's
proof
in
chief
at
street's
trial
consisted
of
several
confessions
by
the
defendant
and
testimony
of
law
enforcement
officers
concerning
the
scene
of
the
crime
that
tended
to
corroborate
certain
details
of
the
defendant's
confession.
from
the
time
of
its
opening
argument
through
its
case
in
chief,
the
state
did
not
mention
the
existence
of
peele's
confession.
thereafter,
the
defendant
presented
an
alibi
defense
and
took
the
stand.
in
his
direct
testimony
the
defendant
admitted
that
peele
had
given
a
confession
which
had
implicated
the
defendant
in
the
murder.
the
defendant
also
admitted
that
he
gave
a
confession
but
maintained
it
was
merely
a
coerced
imitation
of
peele's
earlier
confession.
with
regard
to
this
claim,
the
defendant
maintained
that
prior
to
taking
his
confession,
the
sheriff
repeatedly
read
him
peele's
confession.
the
defendant
also
claimed
that
when
taking
his
confession,
the
sheriff
interrupted
him
any
time
his
account
varied
from
peele's
and
demanded
that
the
defendant
replicate
peele's
version,
which
the
defendant
then
did.
as
part
of
its
rebuttal
proof,
the
state
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
sought
to
introduce
peele's
confession
into
evidence.
over
objection,
the
state
was
allowed
to
introduce
the
confession
for
the
limited,
non-hearsay
purpose
of
establishing
that
it
was
said,
and
with
the
express
goal
of
impeaching
the
defendant's
parroting
claim
with
the
most
appropriate
evidence
available.
limiting
instructions
were
given
on
three
occasions,
and
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
the
state
carefully
limited
its
use
of
and
argument
on
the
accomplice's
confession
to
the
impeachment
purpose
for
which
it
was
introduced.
thereafter,
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
was
given
the
only
sentence
permitted
in
this
case
under
state
law,
life
imprisonment.
on
appeal,
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
of
the
defendant
on
the
ground
that
the
introduction
of
peele's
confession
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
denied
the
defendant
his
confrontation
rights
under
the
sixth
amendment.
the
state
urges
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
below
since
the
limited
introduction
of
the
accomplice's
confession
for
the
impeachment
purposes
on
rebuttal
did
not
violate
the
defendant's
confrontation
rights.
we
contend
that
limiting
instructions
were
adequate
in
this
case
to
avoid
a
confrontation
clause
violation
for
four
reasons
which
i
will
summarize
and
then
address
in
sequence.
first,
the
manner
of
introduction
of
the
questioned
evidence
created
little
if
any
likelihood
of
improper
jury
consideration
of
that
evidence.
second,
there
existed
legitimate
and
compelling
reasons
justifying
the
state's
use
of
such
evidence
in
light
of
the
defendant's
parroting
claim.
third,
no
suitable
alternatives
existed.
and
fourth,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
evidence
was
not
devastating
in
nature.
in
applying
the
confrontation
clause
to
the
admission
into
evidence
of
nontestifying
accomplice
confessions,
bruton,
douglas
and
the
parker
plurality
of
this
court
have
addressed
two
basic
questions:
first,
whether
the
manner
of
introduction
of
such
evidence
creates
a
substantial
likelihood
of
improper
consideration
of
that
evidence
against
the
defendant,
and
second,
if
so,
whether
the
resulting
risk
of
unfair
prejudice
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
practical
necessity
outweighs
the
ability
of
a
jury
to
follow
limiting
instructions
given.
we
suggest
that
both
questions
are
answered
in
the
negative
in
this
case.
as
to
the
first
basic
question,
the
manner
of
introduction
created
little
if
any
likelihood
of
improper
consideration.
unlike
prior
cases
in
this
are
where
no
legitimate
inferences
against
the
defendant
could
be
drawn
from
the
evidence
placed
before
the
jury,
in
this
case
there
was
a
legitimate
inference
that
could
be
drawn
from
the
introduction
of
peele's
statement,
namely,
that
peele's
confession
was
sufficiently
different
from
the
defendant's
so
as
to
negate
the
defendant's
parroting
claim--
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
--it
was
not,
your
honor.
the
evidence
was
introduced
by
the
state
only
after
the
defendant
had
already
focused
the
jury's
attention
on
the
existence
of
the
accomplice's
confession.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
your
honor
is
speaking
of
the
introduction?
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
that
did
not
make
it
adequately
denied.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
it
had
been
denied,
but
it
became
a
swearing
contest
at
that
point
between
the
defendant
and
the
sheriff.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
below
rested
on
a
faulty
assumption
that
because
of
its
appraisal
of
bruton
and
douglas,
they
felt
that
it
always
had
to
be--
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
it
was
wrong
assuming
those
facts
and
interpreting
them
the
way
they
did
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
no,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
because
of
the
limited
nature
of
the
statement's
introduction
in
this
case,
it
was
not
offered
to
prove
the
truth
of
that
statement
but
was
rather
merely
entered
to
show
what
that
statement
was,
to
directly
impeach
on
rebuttal
the
defendant's
claim
that
he
parroted
the
very
terms
of
that
other
confession.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
below
misapplied
this
court's
doctrines
as
enunciated
in
bruton
and
douglas
and
the
parker
plurality
to
find
that
there
necessarily
had
to
be
a
substantial
likelihood
of
improper
consideration.
it
is
our
position
that
that
simply
did
not
occur
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
as
to
peele's
confession?
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
your
honor,
the
subject
first
came
in
in
the
defense
attorney's
opening
remarks
to
the
jury
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
a
co-defendant,
peele,
had
confessed
and
had
implicated
street
in
the
murder.
in
this
case,
as
to
the
substantial
likelihood
of
improper
consideration,
the
defendant
focused
the
jury's
attention
on
the
existence
of
the
accomplice's
confession.
we
submit
that
this
is
important
because
the
jury
had
already
been
informed
by
the
defendant
that
the
accomplice
had
confessed
and
had
implicated
him
in
the
murder,
thereby
avoiding
the
potential
for
any
proper
consideration
of
the
confession
as
introduced
later
by
the
state.
as
to
the
second
basic
question
raised
by
this
court
in
prior
decisions,
both
as
a
policy
and
practical
matter,
any
resulting
risk
of
unfair
prejudice
occasioned
by
the
introduction
of
such
limited
purpose
evidence
on
rebuttal
was
eliminated
through
the
use
of
limiting
instructions.
in
bruton,
this
court
considered
three
factors
in
determining
whether
the
introduction
of
such
evidence
would
further
rather
than
impede
the
search
for
truth,
first,
whether
adequate
justification
exists
for
the
use
of
the
questioned
evidence;
second,
whether
alternatives
exist
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
to
avoid
any
conflict;
and
third,
whether
the
devastating
nature
of
the
evidence
is
too
great
as
a
practical
matter
to
be
cured
by
a
limiting
instruction.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
as
to
the
first
factor,
there
were
legitimate
and
compelling
reasons
justifying
the
state's
use
of
such
evidence
in
this
case.
in
bruton
and
parker,
this
court
dealt
with
judicial
economy
in
a
joint
trial
as
a
justification
for
the
use.
here,
the
more
important
justification
lies
in
the
defendant's
election
to
place
before
the
jury
his
parroting
claim
which
called
into
question
the
very
terms
of
his
accomplice's
confession.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
state
was
justified
in
using
the
accomplice's
confession
because
it
was
the
strongest
and
only
adequate
evidence
to
directly
challenge
that
defendant's
claim.
as
a
policy
matter,
after
making
his
parroting
claim,
the
defendant
should
not
be
allowed
to
invoke
the
confrontation
clause
to
bar
the
limited
non-hearsay
rebuttal
use
of
such
evidence.
such
invocation
of
the
confrontation
clause
would
impede
the
ability
of
the
jury
to
assess
the
credibility
of
the
defendant's
claim,
thereby
posing
a
grave
risk
of
perversion
of
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
trial.
it
would
also
permit
the
defendant
to
use
the
confrontation
clause
as
a
shield
to
subvert
the
very
mission
of
that
clause
as
ensuring
the
fairness
and
accuracy
of
the
criminal
claim.
such
a
policy
is
consistent
with
past
decisions
of
this
court.
in
1948
in
michelson
v.
united
states,
this
court
recognized
that
evidence
which
may
be
too
prejudicial
to
introduce
in
the
state's
proof
in
chief,
even
with
limiting
instructions,
may
nevertheless
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes
once
the
defendant
elects
to
put
that
issue
into
evidence
by
taking
the
stand.
now,
michelson
v.
united
states
admittedly
does
not
raise
constitutional
questions.
however,
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief
suggest
that
constitutional
protections,
whether
afforded
by
prophylactic
exclusionary
rules
or
by
direct
application
of
constitutional
rights,
should
not
provide
a
defendant
with
a
shield
to
bar
the
legitimate
impeachment
techniques
in
assessing
the
credibility
of
a
defendant's
claim
that
he
asserts
on
the
stand.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
i
will
address
both
the
limitations
as
well
as
the
possibility
of
redaction,
your
honor.
as
to
limitations,
we
suggest
that
it
has
to
be
relevant
to
the
impeachment
purpose
for
which
it
is
introduced,
that
many
impeachment
purposes
require
that
the
evidence
be
offered
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
where,
as
in
this
case,
it
is
offered
properly
for
a
relevant,
limited,
non-hearsay
purpose,
to
merely
show
that
that
statement
was
made,
it
would
be
proper.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
prejudicial
impact
in
certain
occasions
may
outweigh
its
probative
value,
and
we
simply
say
that
this
is
not
that
type
of
case,
and
we
do
not
want
this
court
to
give
a
broad
ruling
to
that
effect.
but
when
in
fact
it
is
relevant
and
these
other
factors
weigh
so
heavily
in
its
favor
for
admission,
we
suggest
that
there
are
compelling
reasons
to
admit
it.
as
to
the
redaction
issue,
we
suggest
that
is
the
third
factor
in
this
case...
the
second
factor
in
this
case,
that
no
effective
alternatives
existed.
redaction
or
limited
use
simply
would
not
have
permitted
the
state
to
adequately
use
the
confession
to
challenge
the
parroting--
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
--they
did,
your
honor,
but
they
did
not
offer
any
suggestion
as
to
how
it
might
be--
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
--they
did
hold
that.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
in
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case,
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand
and
simply
say
that
some
portions
of
his
confession
were
parroted.
he
said
anytime
that
his
version
varied
with
peele's,
the
sheriff
would
force
him
to
replicate
peele's
confession,
and
because
of
that
type
of
claim,
it
was
very
relevant
and
in
fact
the
most
significant
evidence
to
introduce
this
confession
for
the
limited
purposes
which
it
was,
in
fact,
introduced
for--
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
that
his
testimony
would
have
only
gone
to
the
veracity
of
his
confession,
and
that
was
wholly
immaterial
to
the
use
for
which
the
state
was
introducing
the
evidence.
we
did
not...
it
simply
was
not
part
of
the
state's
case.
we
only
wanted
to
give
the
jury,
in
assessing
the
defendant's
claim,
the
best
possible
evidence
to
do
that,
namely,
peele's
confession.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
he
could
be
cross
examined,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
--yes,
your
honor,
but
on
issues
totally
immaterial
to
the
limited
purpose
for
which
the
state
was
introducing
this
evidence.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
--your
honor,
that
is
not
what
they
said--
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
i
believe
they
would
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
that
the
question
was
whether
the
defendant
was
in
fact
subject
to
cross
examination
on
the
stand.
availability
was
really
not
an
issue.
everyone
seems
to
agree
that
he
was
in
the
jail
next
door,
and
that
made
no
difference
whether
he
was
actually
in
the
courtroom
or
the
jail,
the
fact
that
he
was
not
taking
the
stand
seemed
to
be
the
turning
point
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
your
honor,
the
reason
why
the
state
found
it
important
to
do
more
was
that
it
was
not
only
the
omissions
in
peele's
statement
that
made
the
parroting
claim
incredible;
there
were
numerous
differences,
only
slight
differences
between
similar
events
that
both
narrated
that
would
show
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
have
merely
been
the
result
of
a
parroting
claim.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
yes,
your
honor,
that
it
was
for
the
jury's
benefit
to
see
both--
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
--it
may
be
the
more
persuasive,
your
honor,
but
we
are
here
arguing
whether
the
defendant's
confrontation
rights
were
violated,
and
we
believe
that
because
of
weighing
the
factors
that
i
mentioned
initially,
those
factors
tipped
the
scale
in
favor
of
the
state's
introduction
of
the
complete
statement
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
by
a
side
bar
conference,
there
could
be,
but
there's
no
formalized
procedure
that
way.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
i
suppose
it
could,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
grunow
in
response
to
the
question
about
taking
the
confession
into
the
jury
room,
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record
that
that
was
done.
however,
in
the
appendix
on
page
350
it
indicates
that
pursuant
to
an
objection
which
was
overruled,
the
jury
was
allowed
to
read
peele's
confession
before
deliberating.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
