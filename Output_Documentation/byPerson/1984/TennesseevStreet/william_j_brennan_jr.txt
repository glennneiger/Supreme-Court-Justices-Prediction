justice
jr.
this
was
not
a
joint
trial,
was
it?
justice
jr.
but
didn't
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
say
to
the
contrary?
justice
jr.
but
they
did
hold,
did
they
not,
that
there
might
have
been
redaction
without
destroying
the
state's
impeachment
use,
didn't
they?
justice
jr.
and
you
disagree
with
that.
