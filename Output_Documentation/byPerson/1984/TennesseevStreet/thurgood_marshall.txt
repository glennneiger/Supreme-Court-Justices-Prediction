justice
marshall
and
after
it
had
been
denied
by
state
officials,
categorically
denied.
justice
marshall
before
it
was
introduced.
didn't
the
sheriff
take
the
stand
and
say
it's
not
true?
justice
marshall
so
it
had
been
adequately
denied,
hadn't
it?
justice
marshall
but
it
had...
well,
it
had
been.
justice
marshall
well,
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
agree
with
you
on
that.
justice
marshall
specifically,
specifically,
the
court
said
no.
the
court
said
that
it
was
used
in
the
argument
to
the
jury
as
to
express
details
of
the
crime,
which
is
in
addition
to
a
falsehood
claim.
justice
marshall
well,
let
me
read
you
one
sentence.
here
the
alleged
confessor
was
not
even
called
to
the
stand.
the
statements
inculpating
the
defendants
stood
basically
unchallenged
as
the
state
directed
inquiry
not
to
those
allegations
but
to
the
factual
statements
surrounding
the
scene
of
the
crime.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
marshall
then
the
court
was
wrong.
justice
marshall
factually.
justice
marshall
do
you
agree
with
this
statement,
that
in
this
case,
while
admission
of
the
confession
was
not
technically
used
to
prove
its
truth,
the
state
actually
placed
before
the
jury
testimony
incriminating
the
defendant
made
by
one
not
available
for
cross
examination.
do
you
agree
with
that
statement?
justice
marshall
and
that's
not
what
your
court
of
appeals
said--
justice
marshall
--he
could
have
been
cross
examined.
justice
marshall
do
you
mean
that
in
kentucky
when
you
put
a
witness
on
the
stand
you
can
ask
him
anything?
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
marshall
well,
you
said
you
couldn't
limit
the
examination.
justice
marshall
if
he
put
a
witness
on
the
stand
in
tennessee,
couldn't
the
defendant
ask
him
anything?
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
that
the
normal
way
to
produce
evidence,
if
you
have
got
a
witness
and
a
written
statement,
isn't
it
normal
that
you
put
your
witness
on?
justice
marshall
isn't
the
normal
way
to
do
it
that
way?
justice
marshall
you
mean,
not
if
you
don't
want
cross
examination.
justice
marshall
i
thought
the
respondent
didn't
want
this
in
there
at
all.
justice
marshall
don't...
please
don't
tell
me
you
are
doing
him
a
favor.

justice

mr.
attorney
general,
could
i
ask
one?
in
tennessee,
is
there
any
procedure
in
a
criminal
case
where
when
the
defendant
in
this
case
made
that
kind
of
a
statement,
that
i
was
made
to
do
this,
the
other
confession
can
say...
have
a
side
bar
conference
and
tell
him
that
if
you
pursue
that
line
of
testimony,
i
am
going
to
let
this
confession
in?
is
there
any
way
to
do
that
in
tennessee?
justice
marshall
but
it
could
be
done
that
way.
justice
marshall
i'm
looking
to
the
future,
that's
all.
