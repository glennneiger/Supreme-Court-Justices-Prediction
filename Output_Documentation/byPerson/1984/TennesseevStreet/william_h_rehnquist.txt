justice
rehnquist
but
he
was
available
certainly
to
the
defense
if
they
had
chosen
to
call
him,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
trial
judge's
theory
of
admitting
that
was
that
it
was
independently
admissible
of
the
truth
to
rebut
your
client's
contention
that
his
confession
was
just
kind
of
a
parrot
job
on
peele's
confession.
justice
rehnquist
and
there
you
don't
have...
if
it's
a
legitimate
hearsay
exception
to
the
confrontation
clause,
you
don't
have
those
two
requirements,
i
don't
think.
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
there
any
independent
grounds
for
admissibility
in
bruton
such
as
there
was
here?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
rogers,
are
you
suggesting
that
any
time
you
have
the
sort
of
competing
interests
that
you
say
could
have
been
balanced
here,
the
question
of
how
they
are
balanced
is
a
question
that
a
state
court
has
to
look
to
the
federal
constitution
on?
