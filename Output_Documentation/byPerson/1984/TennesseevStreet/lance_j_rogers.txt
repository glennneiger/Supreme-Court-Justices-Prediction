mr.
lance
j.
rogers
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
question
how
to
accommodate
two
valid
competing
interests.
on
the
one
hand
we
have
the
state's
interest
in
impeaching
a
testifying
defendant,
and
on
the
other
hand
we
have
the
defendant's
interest
in
preserving
his
confrontation
rights--
it
is
our
position
that
both
parties
here
had
an
interest
in
the
confession
of
clifford
peele.
the
state
was
interested
in
demonstrating
that
the
two
confessions
were
not
identical,
and
the
defense
was
interested
in
preserving
street's
confrontation
rights
by
making
sure
that
those
portions
of
the
confession
of
clifford
peele
which
directly
accused
street
of
committing
the
crime
charged,
were
not
read
to
the
jury.
both
of
these
purposes
could
have
been
served
in
this
case
if
the
state
had
simply
redacted
the
portions
which
directly
incriminated
street
or
abided
by
the
original
agreement--
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
--no,
we
didn't
want
the
parts
that
accused
him
of
taking
an
active
part--
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
--well,
we
think
an
inference
is
a
little
bit
less
prejudicial
than
the
words
from
a
virtual
eye
witness
to
the
crime
as
far
as
jury--
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
--and
because
the
sheriff
forced
him
to.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
no...
well,
it
was
our
point,
but
we
thought
at
the
time
that
the--
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
--we
can
redact
the
part
that
accuses
joe
street
of
actually
participating
in
the
crime.
there
were
several
differences
in
this
case
which
the
state
deemed
critical
to
their
position,
and
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
how.
they
had
called
sheriff
papantoniou
to
the
stand
to
read
peele's
confession
and
then
engaged
in
an
agreement
with
the
defense
to
merely
highlight
the
differences.
that
is,
in
response
to
the
questions
from
the
prosecutor,
they
would
highlight
the
differences
between
the
two
confessions
without
reading
all
of
peele's
confession
to
the
jury.
in
pursuit
of
this
agreement,
the
court
instructed
the
sheriff
to
read
the
confession
to
himself,
which
he
did,
and
at
this
point
the
prosecutor
approached
the
bench
and
then
requested
permission
to
read
the
entire
text
into
evidence.
the
court
reminded
him
of
the
original
agreement,
but
the
prosecutor
claimed
it
would
be
more
coherent
if
he
read
the
entire
text
into
evidence.
he
then
read
the
entire
text
into
evidence
and
then
proceeded
to
do
precisely
what
he
said
he
could
not
do,
and
that
is
have
sheriff
papantonious
highlight
differences
between
the
two
of
them
in
response
to
questioning
without
mentioning
any
of
the
portions
of
the
confession
which
accused
joe
street
of
participating
in
the
crime.
there
were
seven
critical
distinctions,
and
on
closing
argument,
the
prosecutor
again
went
through
those
seven
distinctions.
it
is
our
position
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
violated
once
the
state
went
beyond
what
was
necessary
to
show
that
the
two
statements
were
not
identical
and
that
this
violation
was
not
cured
either
through
limiting
instructions
or
by
simply
labeling
it
non-hearsay.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
well,
it
is
our
position--
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
--well,
we
think
that
the
heart
of
the
bruton
decision
is
that
a
jury
is
simply
unable
to
disregard
the
dramatic
impact
of
an
accomplice's
confession,
particularly--
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
--well,
i
think
it
was
labeled
a
confrontation
issue
in
bruton
because
evans
was
not
available
for
cross
examination
regarding
that
statement,
and
i
think
we
can
say
the
same
thing
about
clifford
peele.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
if
we
could
have
called
him
and
gotten
him...
and
labeled
him
a
hostile
witness,
we
still
would
have
been
faced
with
the
situation
where
the
state
had
already
accomplished
what
they
had
wanted
to
accomplish
and
gotten
the
confession
before
the
jury
because
as
i
see
it,
the
confrontation
clause
has
two
prongs.
it
is
cross
examination
and
requiring
the
declarant
to
make
the
accusation
under
oath
in
a
judicial
forum.
well,
the
first
prong
had
already
been
removed
because
peele
had
already
made
the
statement
through
sheriff
papantoniou's
mouth.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
right,
because
it
was
not
being
offered
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted,
a
hearsay--
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
--i
still
think
that
under
bruton,
labeling
it
hearsay...
i
don't
think
there's
any
distinction
between
telling
the
jury
don't
use
this
confession
against
this
defendant,
use
it
against
that
defendant,
and
don't
use
this
confession
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted,
but
do
use
it
against
the
defendant.
i
think
the
jury
is
very
quickly
able
to
pierce
through
to
the
important
part
of
the
confession,
and
that
is
the
accusatory
part.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
not
against
bruton
himself,
no,
there
wasn't,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
critical...
i
don't
think
that's
critical
to
the
decision
in
bruton.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
justice
o'connor.
in
harris
and
hass
and
that
line
of
cases,
the
sword/shield
cases,
we
engage
in
a
balancing
test,
balancing
the
reason
for
the
admission
against
the
reason
for
the
exclusion.
in
those
cases
we
exclude...
evidence
that
was
reliable
and
trustworthy
was
excluded
and
the
truth
was
frustrated
in
order
to
deter
police
misconduct,
in
order
to
get
them
to
comply
with
miranda,
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
statements
themselves.
they
were
not
involuntary
or
coerced.
so
the
balancing
test
favored
using
the
evidence
to
enhance
the
truth
finding
function
of
the
trial.
in
this
case,
though,
peele's
statement
was
excluded
precisely
because
it
did
constitute
a
threat
to
truth
determination
either
under
a
hearsay
analysis
or
confrontation
analysis.
under
bruton,
the
in-custody
confession
of
an
accomplice
is
inevitably
suspect,
and
i
think
that
makes
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
sword/shield
cases.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
yes,
that's
a
fact.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
well,
at
that
point
in
the
trial
the
state
had
given
every
indication
that
they
were
going
to
call
clifford
peele
on
direct
examination,
and
so
as
a
tactical
matter,
there
was
an
interest
in
trying
to
diffuse
what
we
thought
would
be
his
potentially
incriminating,
indeed,
devastating
testimony
against
joe
street,
and
also
to
introduce
it
for
whatever
relevance
it
would
have
on
the
parroting
point.
at
a
minimum,
though,
our
position
there
is
no
more
inconsistent
than
that
of
the
state
because
the
state
objected
at
that
point
to
introduction
of
that
statement.
it
is
our
position
that
to
the
jury,
that
the
impeachment
value
of
clifford
peele's
confession
was
not
that
the
two
statements
were
not
identical,
but
rather,
that
it
rebutted
joe
street's
alibi
defense
by
placing
him
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
assigning
him
an
active
role
in
the
murder.
there
was
no
physical
evidence
linking
joe
street
to
the
crime,
and
there
were
no
eye
witnesses
presented
by
the
state.
peele's
confession,
however,
provided
the
state
with
its
missing
eye
witness
testimony
free
of
the
risk
of
cross
examination
and
free
of
the
risk
of
the
jury
viewing
his
demeanor.
we
believe
also
that
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
properly
interpreted
the
interlocking
confession
doctrine
by
holding
that
it
does
not
apply
to
severed
trials.
at
joint
trial
the
state
has
a
compelling
interest
in
introducing
the
confessions
of
the
codefendants.
the
state
is
presented
with
a
dilemma.
they
have
two
or
maybe
even
three
perfectly
valid
confessions
which
they
wish
to
introduce
against
the
confessers,
but
under
a
rigid
bruton
application,
they
are
prohibited
from
introducing
those
confessions
against
the
confessers.
parker
and
the
similar
interlocking
confession
cases
allows
them
to
introduce
the
confessions
against
the
confessers,
but
they
had
already
accomplished
that
purpose
in
this
case,
and
we
feel
that
that
is
a
distinction.
we
also
believe
that
this
court
should
decline
to
reverse
pursuant
to
the
doctrine
of
harmless
error.
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
concluded,
after
examining
the
record,
that
they
could
not
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
confrontation
violation
here
had
no
effect
on
the
verdict
or
that
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
otherwise
overwhelming.
they
could
not
say
that
the
jury
would
have
returned
the
same
verdict
without
clifford
peele's
confession.
other
than
joe
street's
own
recanted
confession,
there
was
no
physical
evidence
or
eye
witnesses
presented
by
the
state.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
if
they
called
clifford
peele
on
direct,
yes,
they
could.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
i
think
it
would
also
be
relevant
on
the
impeachment.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
yes.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
yes.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
yes,
if
he
had
been
there
in
the
courtroom
personally.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
i'm
sorry,
i
have
misinterpreted
tennessee
law.
you
have
to
have--
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
--yes,
i'm
sorry.
it
is
our
position
that
peele's
confession
provided
the
state
with
its
missing
eye
witness
testimony
and
that
it
also
provided
the
jury
with
all
the
requisite
elements
of
the
homicide
had
they
chosen
to
believe
that
joe
street's
confession
was
involuntary.
getting
back
to
my
original
point,
i
think
this
really
is
a
simple
case
requiring
the
accommodation
of
two
valid
competing
interests,
the
state's
interest
in
showing
that
the
two
confessions
were
not
identical,
and
the
defense
interest
in
keeping
out
those
portions
of
the
confession
which
directly
accuse
joe
street
of
committing
the
crime
charged.
both
purposes
could
have
been
satisfied
by
either
redacting
the
statement
or
abiding
by
the
original
agreement
to
merely
have
the
sheriff
highlight
those
seven
differences
which
the
state
demonstrated
that
they
could
well
do,
and
they
demonstrated
again
in
closing
argument
when
they
highlighted
the
seven
differences
again
for
the
jury
without
referring
to
any
of
the
portions
of
clifford
peele's
confession
which
incriminated
the
respondent.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
i
think
that
there
they
could
look
to
either
the
federal
or
state
constitution
on
the
issue,
but
when
there
is
a
confrontation
problem
involved,
i
think
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
balancing
and
competing
interests
precisely
because
of
the
reasons,
when
i
responded
to
justice
o'connor's
question
regarding
the
sword/shield
cases.
you
need
that
balancing,
the
reasons
for
the
admission
versus
the
reasons
for
the
exclusion,
and
if
they
can
accomplish
it
in
this
case
without
referring
to
those
portions
that
directly
accuse
him
of
committing
the
crime
charged,
i
think
we
should
weight
that
on
balance.
it
is
our
position
that
the
confession
of
clifford
peele
devastated
the
case
for
the
respondent.
he
presented
an
alibi
defense
with
13
witnesses
in
support
of
that
alibi
defense.
he
took
the
stand
and
asserted
that
alibi
defense
and
presented
a
plausible
explanation
for
his
own
confession.
the
state
presented
no
physical
evidence,
presented
no
eye
witnesses
against
joe
street.
all
they
had
was
his
own
recanted
confession.
except
for
clifford
peele,
reading
his
confession
not
only
was
unnecessary
but
provided
the
state
with
its
missing
eye
witness
testimony.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
only
to
the
extent
that
clifford
peele's
confession
corroborated
certain
things
found
at
the
scene.
mr.
lance
j.
rogers
well,
yes,
i
think
items
like
that,
but
i
meant
there
weren't...
there
were
extensive
tests,
hair,
fingerprints,
things
like
that,
and
none
of
these
were
found
in
this
case.
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals.
