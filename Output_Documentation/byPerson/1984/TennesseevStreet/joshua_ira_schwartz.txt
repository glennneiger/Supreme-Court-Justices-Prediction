mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
view
of
the
united
states,
the
decision
of
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
represents
a
misapplication
of
the
doctrine
of
this
court's
decision
in
bruton
v.
united
states.
contrary
to
the
argument
of
respondent,
this
court's
decision
in
bruton
does
not
hold
that
the
reception
in
evidence
for
any
purpose
of
the
inculpatory
statement
of
a
nontestifying
accomplice
necessarily
violates
the
confrontation
clause,
nor
does
it
hold
that
instructions
that
limit
the
use
of
such
a
statement
are
in
all
cases
ineffective.
rather,
as
we
understand
it,
the
court
held
that
in
light
of
the
inadmissibility
of
the
hearsay
statement
incriminating
bruton
in
that
case,
the
critical
weight
added
to
the
prosecution's
case
by
the
declarant
statement
there
and
the
general
availability
of
separate
trials
as
a
device
to
avoid
the
problem
that
existed
in
bruton,
there
was
no
sufficient
justification
for
running
the
risk
that
the
limiting
instruction
given
in
bruton
would
prove
an
insufficient
bulwark
against
the
risk
of
unfair
prejudice
that
would
result
if
the
instruction
were
disregarded.
this
case
differs
from
bruton
in
numerous
critical
respects
which
we
believe
call
for
a
different
conclusion
here
and
require
that
the
judgment
of
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
be
reversed.
bruton
emphasizes
the
inadmissibility
under
the
traditional
rules
of
evidence
as
against
the
defendant
bruton
of
the
declarant's
out
of
court
statement.
here,
of
course,
the
declarant
peele's
statement
was
admissible
against
respondent
for
a
proper
purpose,
and
there
doesn't
really
seem
to
be
any
debate
that
the
state
had
a
legitimate
objective
here
and
it
was
one
that
we
deem
compelling.
that
purpose,
of
course,
was
to
enable
the
jury
to
assess
the
respondent's
claim
that
his
own
statement
was
a
coerced
imitation
of
the
declarant's,
and
we
agree
with
the
state's
argument
that
the
very
best
evidence
available
to
the
jury
to
assess
that
claim
was
to
look
at
the
statement
itself.
this
is
partly,
justice
stevens,
because
of
the
fact
that...
i
think
it
would
naturally
occur
to
a
juror
that
the
best
way
is
to
look
at
the
two
statements
side
by
side
to
see
what
all
the
nuances
are,
and
while
it
may
have
been
sufficient,
i
might
well...
we
as
jurors
might
well
have
been
persuaded
by
the
omissions
factor,
a
juror
in
assessing
this
claim
i
think
would
want
to
see
the
whole
thing,
and
i
think
it
was
an
important
kind
of
evidence.
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
well,
this
case
has
a
peculiar
fact
in
that
regard.
the
defendant
did
attempt
to
do
that
and
failed
in
doing
so
on
the
grounds
that
the
statement
was
hearsay.
at
the
point
in
the
case
where
that
occurred,
it
may
have
been
premature,
but
the
defendant
did
signal
his
own
understanding
that
this
was
the
most
appropriate
way
to
prove
his
claim
by
attempting
to
get
the
statement
before
the
court.
so
it
probably
does
not
lie
terribly
well
in
the
respondent's
mouth
to
say
that
this
is
an
inappropriate
way
of
demonstrating
this.
the
other
factor
which,
if
i
can
pick
up
further
on
your
colloquy
with
the
attorney
general,
if
the
sheriff
had
simply
denied,
as
he
did,
that
these
particular
facts
were
in
peele's
statement,
there
would
of
course
have
been
the
question
of
whether
that
was
true.
now,
you
said,
justice
stevens--
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
--but
if
that
statement
went
to
the
jury,
i
am
not
sure,
which
would
ultimately
have
to
assess
whether
he
was
telling
the
truth.
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
well,
that
may
be,
but
we
suggest
that
if
there
was
a
controversy,
the
jury
would
be
the
judge
of
that,
and
that
to
one
side,
there
were
significant
additional
factors
in
terms
of
assessing
the
document
as
a
whole.
i
think
the
rational
juror
would
want
to
see
the
documents.
as
for
the
question--
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
--it
was
introduced
as
an
exhibit.
i
don't
know
from
the
record--
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
--i'm
probably
the
wrong
person
to
ask
that.
i
believe
my
colleague
has
a
minute
or
so
of
rebuttal.
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
on
the
question
which
was
the
only
question
material
to
the
state's
purpose
in
putting
the
statement
before
the
jury
on
rebuttal,
whether
the
declarant
had
actually
made
the
statement,
the
purpose
and
requirements
of
the
confrontation
clause
were
satisfied,
sheriff
papantoniou,
through
whose
testimony
the
statement
was
put
before
the
jury
initially,
was
available
for
cross
examination.
this
court's
decision
in
dutton
v.
evans
establishes,
we
believe,
that
there
is
no,
in
those
circumstances,
there
is
no
confrontation
clause
problem,
and
we
believe
that
that
conclusion
is
supported
not
only
by
the
opinion
for
the
plurality
of
justice
stewart,
but
also
by
justice
harlan's
concurring
opinion,
and
therefore
was
endorsed
by
a
majority
of
the
court
in
dutton.
conversely,
we
would
emphasize,
the
state's
purpose
in
laying
the
declarant's
statement
before
the
jury
could
not
have
been
served
by
presenting
the
declarant's
testimony
in
lieu
of
his
statement.
because
of
this
unique
situation
that
the
live
testimony
wouldn't
have
served
the
state's
purpose
and
the
statement
did
not
go
to
the...
was
not
offered
for
the
truth
of
its
content,
it
would
have
been
very
peculiar
to
impose
upon
the
state
as
respondent
would
have
it
and
as
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
it,
the
burden
of
calling
the
declarant
as
a
witness
simply
so
that
respondent
could
cross
examine
him
on
matters
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
state's
case.
indeed,
if
one
accept's
the
respondent's
premise,
one
might
well
ask
what
examination
the
state
was
required
to
undertake
of
mr.
peele.
was
this--
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
--i
don't
believe
i
said
that.
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
oh,
i
do
not
speak
as
the
expert
on
tennessee.
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
well,
there
may
be
procedural
rules
about
scope
of
cross
examination,
but
we
would
suppose
that
if
the
scope
had
limited
its
examination,
that
may--
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
--but
if
the
purpose
of--
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
--not
if
one's
purpose
is
to
prove
that
the
statement
was
made
rather
than--
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
--if
the
purpose...
if
the
defendant's
purpose
was
to
be
able
to
examine
mr.
peele,
that
purpose
could
have
been
fully
satisfied.
the
court's
decision
in
ohio
v.
roberts
makes
it
clear
that
whether
it
is
billed
cross
examination
or
direct
examination,
a
person
who
is
physically
available,
as
peele
certainly
was...
his
location
was
known
to
all.
he
was
conveniently
located
in
the
county
jail...
could
have
been
called
as
a
defense
witness
and
there
is
no
question
that
whether
it
is
called
direct
or
cross
examination,
he
could
have
been
examined
on
the
topics
that
were
of
interest
to
the
respondent.
it
makes
practical
sense,
we
would
submit,
to
leave
this
choice
in
this
situation
to
the
respondent
because
it
is
the
respondent
who
wants
to
examine
the
declarant
on
subjects
that
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
state's
case.
in
this
situation
there
were
several
possibilities.
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
but
it
is
the
respondent's
complaint
that--
mr.
joshua
ira
schwartz
--no
doubt
the
respondent
would
have
preferred
not
to
have
that
statement
in,
but
we
do
not
believe
the
law
affords
him
the
choice
of
saying
that
his...
of
testifying
that
his
was
a
coerced
imitation
of
peele's
confession
and
still
not
having
the
jury
have
a
look
at
that
statement.
if
respondent
believed
that
it
would
be
in
his
interest
to
call
the
declarant
as
a
witness,
and
he
deemed
unacceptable
the
risk
that
the
court's
limiting
instruction
would
confine
the
jury
properly,
he
was
free
to
call
the
declarant
as
a
witness,
and
he
was
fully
able
to
fulfill
any
legitimate
confrontation
objective
by
that
process.
of
course,
as
we
said,
the
respondent
was
equally
available
to
the
respondent
situated
in
the
county
jail.
if
the
respondent...
if
the
declarant...
if
the
respondent
had
called
the
declarant,
there
are
several
possibilities.
the
declarant
might
have
reiterated
his
confession,
as
this
court's
decision
in
nelson
v.
o'neill
points
out.
that
surely
would
not
have
put
the
respondent
in
a
better
position.
it
is
possible
that
he
would
have
disavowed
the
confession.
this
would
have
helped
the
defendant
in
some
sense,
but
if
the
defendant
thought
that
would
occur,
it
is
not
clear
to
us
why
that
could
not
have
been
done.
it
clearly
could
have
been
done
as
part
of
the
defense
case.
and
finally,
it
is
possible
that
the
declarant
would
have
taken
the
fifth
amendment
and
would
have
been
unavailable.
and
if
that
were
to
have
occurred,
it
would
be
a
very
extreme
result
and
nonetheless
hold
that
even
if
that
had
occurred,
there
would
have
been
no
opportunity
for
the
state
to
use
the
statement.
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
comment
on
if
time
allows
concerns
the
bearing
of
this
court's
decision
in
parker
v.
randolph
on
this
case.
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
thought
that
parker
v.
randolph
had
no
bearing
because
this
case
did
not
involve
a
joint
trial.
in
that
respect
we
believe
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
got
the
matter
precisely
backwards,
as
is
detailed
in
our
brief.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
