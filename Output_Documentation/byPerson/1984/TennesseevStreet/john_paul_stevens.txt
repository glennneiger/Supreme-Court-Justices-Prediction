justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
factual
question
to
be
sure
i
have
this
right?
is
it
correct
that
the
defendant
at
the
trial
did
not
challenge
the
fact
that
this...
that
he
said
the
words
that
were
said
to
be
his
confession?
rather,
only
his
position
was
he
said
them
under
coercion
and
so
forth?
justice
stevens
but
the
actual
text
was
not...
there
is
no
real
dispute
about
that.
justice
stevens
okay.
i
wanted
to
be
sure.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
an
alternative
way
of
handling
the
problem?
as
i
understand
it,
the
point
was
that
peele's
confession
did
not
have
some
facts
in
it
that
the
defendant's
confession
did
have,
and
you
wanted
to
show
therefore
the
defendant's
could
not
have
been
parrotted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
reading
the
confession,
as
i
understand
the
record,
the
officer
was
asked
were
these
facts
as
in
the
confession
you
just
read,
and
he
denied
as
to
each
of
those
facts.
justice
stevens
why
couldn't
he
have
been
asked
those
questions
without
reading
the
confession,
and
then
had
the
confession
in
the
courtroom
in
order
to
verify
whether
or
not
the
testimony
was
true?
why
was
it
necessary
to
read
the
confession
and
not
just
identify
those
points?
justice
stevens
so
you
would
agree
that
if
you
were
focusing
on
the
omissions,
and
that
were
the
whole
point,
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
read
the
confession.
justice
stevens
so
your
point
is
there
is
a
little
difference
in
the
style
and
the
language
and
so
forth?
justice
stevens
well,
but
why
wouldn't
the
impeachment
have
been
adequate
just
with
the
omission
point?
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
most
persuasive,
because
you
had
independent
evidence
i
think
at
the
scene
that
coincided
with
what
the
defendant
had
said
and
what
had
been
omitted
from
peele's
confession,
so
that
i
don't
know
why
you
had
to...
it
seems
to
me
that
is
by
far
the
more
persuasive
impeachment
of
the
two.
justice
stevens
in
the
closing
argument
did
the
prosecutor
make
much
of
the
difference
in
style?
i
know
he
made
a
great
deal
of
the
omissions.
justice
stevens
he
did.
justice
stevens
but
isn't
the
argument
also
available
that
the
burden
really
was
on
the
defendant
to
prove
his
parroting
claim?
i
mean,
he's
the
one
who
brought
it
up,
and
i
would
suppose
if
there
were
merit
to
it,
he
would
have
been
the
one
to
put
the
confession
in.
justice
stevens
well,
i
am
suggesting
have
the
confession
in
the
courtroom
so
that
the
defendant
then
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
show
he
was
lying.
justice
stevens
i'm
not
suggesting
it
would
have
to
go
to
the
jury.
if
the
officer
says
a,
b,
and
c
are
in
one
statement
and
not
the
other,
and
they
are
both
sitting
here
in
the
courtroom
and
nobody
submits
them
to
the
jury,
that
testimony
is
pretty
persuasive.
justice
stevens
mr.
rogers,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
a
minute
and
get
it
out
on
the
table
the
thing
that
troubles
me?
why,
if
your...
if
the
defense
theory
was
correct
in
this
whole
matter,
why
would
it
not
have
served
the
defendant's
purpose
to
have
the
fact
that
the
confession
implicated
the
defendant
brought
before
the
jury?
why
would
you
want
it
redacted?
wasn't
that
the
heart
of
the
argument
you
were
making?
justice
stevens
but
you
brought
it
out
on
direct
examination
that
the
confession
implicated
him,
and
that's
why,
according
to
your
theory,
there
was
this
parroting.
justice
stevens
was
it
not
your
theory
at
trial
that
the
reason
your
client
confessed
was
that
this
other
man
had
said
he
was
guilty
of
the
crime?
justice
stevens
right,
but
wasn't
it
part
of
the
whole
theory
that
you
were
trying
to
develop
was
that
there
was
another
confession
that
implicated
your
client?
if
that
wasn't
your
point,
what
was
your
point?
justice
stevens
then
how
can
you
redact
the
heart
of
your
point?
justice
stevens
is
that
entirely
correct?
isn't
it
true...
now,
maybe
my
recollection
is
wrong,
but
there
were
some
things
in
his
statement
that
were
corroborated
by
physical
evidence
at
the
scene.
is
that
wrong?
justice
stevens
but
there
was...
even
without
peele's
confession,
you
say
there
was
nothing
in
the
defendant's
confession
that
was
corroborated
by
physical
evidence
like,
for
example,
the
rope
and
things
like
that?
