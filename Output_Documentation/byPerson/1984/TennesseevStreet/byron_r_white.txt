it
have
impressed
the
court
of

or
your
court
below
if
you
had
called
the
person
who
had
already
been

you
suppose
that

made
any
difference
to
the
court
below?
justice

--that's
what
the

what
your

it
your
position
that
the
court--

criminal
appeals...
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
have
come
out
the
same
even
if
the
confessor
had
been
in
the
courtroom?

they
see
the
documents?

what
if...
what
if
peele
had
been
there

put
him
on
the
stand
and
they
had...
they
asked

he
says
they
are
still
correct,
what...
could
the
state
use
that
confession
then
against...
to
prove
your
client's
guilt?
justice
white
and
if
they
had
called
him
and
he
had
been
in
the
courtroom,
could
they
have
used
it
for
impeachment?
justice

and
it
would
have
been
admissible,
his
confession
would
have
been
admissible.

for
impeachment
purposes.

and
to
prove
the
guilt
of
the

you
sure
they
could
have
impeached
their
own
witness?
you
are
willing
to
concede
that,
put
the
man
on
the
stand
and--

tried
a
lot
of
cases
where
