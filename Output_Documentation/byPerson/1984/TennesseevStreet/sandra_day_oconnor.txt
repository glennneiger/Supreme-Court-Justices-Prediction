justice
o'connor
mr.
grunow,
are
there
any
limits
in
your
view
on
the
use
of
such
evidence
by
the
state?
is
redaction
of
the
statement
required
on
occasion?
are
there
any
limitations
in
your
view
on
the
use
of
the
evidence
for
impeachment
purposes?
justice
o'connor
oh,
yes,
assuming
it
is
relevant,
are
there
any
limitations
by
virtue
of
the
prejudicial
nature
of
the
evidence?
justice
o'connor
counsel,
i
am
really
a
little
puzzled
by
how
the
confrontation
clause
should
require
the
state
to
call
the
declarant
when
the
statement
of
the
declarant
is
not
introduced
for
purposes
of
proving
the
truth
of
the
contents
of
the
statement.
justice
o'connor
that's
such
a
basic
rule
of
evidence,
it
is
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
the
confrontation
clause
comes
in
at
all.
justice
o'connor
well,
that
might
invoke
a
due
process
concern,
but
it
is
very
hard
for
me
to
see
how
it
raises
a
confrontation
issue.
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
this
much
like
or
analogous
to
the
situation
in
the
harris
case
where
it
was
held
that
you
could
properly
admit
for
impeachment
purposes
statements
that
were
inadmissible
under
miranda,
not
for
the
truth
of
those
statements
but
for
impeachment,
and
isn't
this
the
same
thing?
justice
o'connor
is
it
the
fact
that
your
client
today
sought
to
introduce
the
same
statement
himself
earlier
in
the
trial,
mr.
peele's
statement?
justice
o'connor
so
the
argument
rings
just
a
little
bit
hollow,
doesn't
it?
