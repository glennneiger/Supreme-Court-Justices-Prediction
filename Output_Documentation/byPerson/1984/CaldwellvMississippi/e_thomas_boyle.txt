mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
there
are
three
issues
that
i
would
like
to
address
in
this
appeal.
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
remarks
by
the
prosecutor
that
the
verdict,
jury
verdict
is
non-final
and
subject
to
appellate
review
constitutes
constitutional
error.
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
denial
of
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
in
denying
experts
and
a
criminal
investigator.
and
thirdly,
whether
certain
remarks
by
the
prosecutor
at
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
trial,
wherein
he
alluded
and
compared
this
case
with
all
the
other
capital
cases
that
he
had
tried,
whether
or
not
that
constitutes
plain
error
which
this
court
should
notice
under
the
due
process
clause.
the
facts
with
regard
to
the
first
issue
are
as
follows.
under
mississippi
practice,
the
prosecutor
has
the
right
to
open
and
close
during
summation.
during
the
rebuttal
portion
of
his
summation
to
the
jury,
he
argued,
your
decision
is
not
the
final
decision.
your
decision
is
reviewable.
defense
counsel
immediately
objected.
the
court
ruled
on
that
objection
and
overruled
it,
stating
that
under
the
mississippi
death
statute
there
was
in
fact
mandatory
review
of
decisions
by
the
jury
in
a
capital
case,
and
instructed
the
prosecutor
to
make
full
expression
of
his
argument.
the
prosecutor
proceeded
to
state
to
the
jury
that
defense
counsel
had
wrongfully
insinuated
that
their
decision
was
not
final,
and
again
repeated
that
it
was
subject
to
review.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
yes.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
yes,
he
did.
your
honor,
on
appeal
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court
with
regard
to
this
issue,
assigned
appellate
counsel
failed
to
set
this
forth
in
the
claim
of
error
statement
which
is
required
to
be
filed
under
rule
6b
of
the
rules
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
split
four
to
four,
with
one
judge
disqualifying
himself.
the
court
ruled...
based
its
decision
primarily
on
three
grounds,
first,
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
california
against
ramos,
that
the
states
were
free
to
determine
what
the
jury
would
hear
in
this
area,
and
felt
that
this
was
appropriate
argument.
secondly,
they
maintained
that
this
was
invited
error
by
suggesting
that
imprisonment
was
for
the
rest
of
the
petitioner's
natural
life,
and
thirdly,
the
court
held
that
the
issue
was
foreclosed
by
virtue
of
the
failure
of
counsel
to
comply
with
rule
6b.
petitioner
maintains
that
the
remarks
violated
the
due
process
clause
and
the
eighth
amendment
first
on
the
ground
that
those
remarks
were
false
and
misleading
to
the
jury.
the
statute
involved
here,
and
it
is
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
6a
of
our
appendix
to
that
brief,
on
its
face
and
as
construed
by
that
court,
is
a
final
determination.
it
is
the
sole
and
exclusive
function
of
the
jury
in
the
state
of
mississippi
to
ascertain
and
determine
the
appropriate
sentence
in
a
capital
case.
the
argument
here
that
they
were
not
the
final
determiners
of
that
sentence
is
simply
false.
moreover,
it
was
false
also
in
suggesting
to
the
jury
that
someone
else
shared
the
responsibility
which
under
that
state
statute
is
solely
and
exclusively
theirs.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
it
would
not,
your
honor.
however,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
it
would
be
a
much
different
case
for
this
court
to
consider
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
counsel
here
argued
in
addition
to
the
review
element
the
fact
that
it
was
a
non-final
judgment.
secondly,
we
maintain
that
the
argument
by
the
prosecutor
unconstitutionally
diminished
the
jury's
responsibility
for
imposition
of
the
death
sentence.
the
remarks
here
were
intended
to
overcome
the
jurors'
natural
reluctance
to
return
a
death
sentence
by
diluting
their
responsibility
for
the
consequence
of
those
actions.
the
dissent
below
pointed
out
that
a
juror
in
deliberation
is
going
to
be...
feeling
that
death
is
an
inappropriate
sentence,
is
simply
going
to
be
much
less
likely
to
hold
out
in
the
event
that
he
or
she
knew
that
any
error
could
be
corrected
in
connection
with
an
appeal.
this
court
in
the
witherspoon
case
admittedly
in
a
totally
different
context
indicated
that
it
is
a
fundamental
guarantee
of
due
process
that
the
decision
as
to
whether
a
person
lives
or
dies
must
be
made
on
scales
that
are
not
deliberately
tipped
toward
death.
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
the
prosecutor's
argument
here
encouraged
the
jurors
to
err
on
the
side
of
death
with
the
false
assurance
that
if
death
is
not
appropriate,
the
supreme
court
will
correct
that
error.
the
verdict
based
on
such
remarks
is
one
in
which
the
jurors'
moral
responsibility
is
diminished
to
unconstitutional
proportions.
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
the
california
against
ramos
case,
which
we
submit
is
simply
not
controlling
in
this
case,
and
we
make
that
argument
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
in
california
against
ramos,
this
court
made
it
very,
very
clear
that
they
were
paying
due
deference
to
the
state
statute,
the
enactment
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
california.
here,
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
dealing
with
the
remarks
of
a
prosecutor,
and
although
there
is
legislation
in
this
area
to
the
effect
that
there
is
mandatory
review,
that
legislation,
unlike
the
briggs
instructions,
does
not
embody
also
the
instruction
that
the
jury
be
told
about
it.
and
so
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
a
very,
very
significant
distinction.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
if
we
are
talking
just
about
that
element,
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
state
to
determine
and
so
advise
the
judges
of
the
trial
courts
that
this
is
a
matter
for
particular
instruction
for
the
jury.
we
have
the
element
in
this
case,
justice
rehnquist,
of
a
misleading
statement
in
addition
to
the
comment
and
interrelated
to
the
comment
on
judicial
review.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
there
is
another
reason
with
regard
to
the
state
policy
why
it
would
not
be
admissible,
and
that
is,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
under
california
law
in
the
ramos
case
evidence
was
permitted
on
the
factor
which
this
court
equated
with
future
dangerousness
as
being
a
question
of
fact,
and
evidence
was
admissible
with
regard
to
that
element,
and
counsel
could
comment
on
it.
you
don't
have
that
situation
here.
here
you
have
the
unmitigated,
i
submit
to
the
court,
danger
of
speculation
solely
on
what
these
nine
justices
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
will
do,
and
i
submit
that
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
nature
of
that
speculation
is
no
more
visible
in
this
case
where
you
have
this
four
to
four
split
which
affirmed
and
one
judge
disqualifying,
and
then,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
at
a
later
time
the
judge
who
disqualified
himself
actually
joined
the
dissenting
opinion
here
to
make
it
the
majority.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
i
don't
think
we
are
saying
that
at
all.
it
is
just
that
there
are
factors
here
that
were
not
present
in
the
ramos
case
that
make
ramos
not
controlling
in
this
particular
situation.
if
your
honor
is
positing
the
question
whether
or
not
in
the
event
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
their
infinite
wisdom
decided
to
permit
comment
on
non-review,
i
would
first
of
all
take
the
position
that
it
shouldn't
be
done
by
the
prosecutor,
and
if
it
is
going
to
be
done,
as
it
was
done
in
the
ramos
case,
it
is
an
instruction
by
the
court.
but
that
really
is
a
hypothetical
which
has
been
decided
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
which
has
said,
we
don't
want
this
statute
to
go
to
the
jury.
so
that
is
the
state
of
the
law
today
in
mississippi
by
virtue
of
cases
which
came
after
the
caldwell
case.
lastly,
we
would
argue
that
under
the
woodson
against
north
carolina
standard,
the
speculation
here
and
the
remark
by
defense
counsel
simply
diverted
the
jury
from
considering
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
the
individual
characteristics
of
the
offender,
which
really
are
the
true
focus
and
the
constitutional
obligation
of
a
jury
to
consider.
we
maintain
that
there
was
no
invited
error.
this
court
decided
the
young
case.
just
last
week
it
was
handed
up.
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
it
made
it
clear
that
the
invited
reply
theory
as
far
as
prosecutorial
argument
is
a
response
in
kind,
and
here
there
is
simply
no
response
in
kind.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
i
read
it
as...
we
were
dealing
with...
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
federal
prosecutor
in
that
case.
i
believe
they
were
dealing
with
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
i
haven't
got
it
with
me,
your
honor,
but
it
dealt
with--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--i
stand
corrected.
one
of
the
arguments
we
are
making
here,
and
it
comes
in
the
third
part,
is
dealing
with
plain
error,
which
perhaps
is
more
appropriate
with
regard
to
that
aspect
of
the
opinion,
but
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
here
is
that
there
must
be
a
response
in
kind,
and
i
submit
that
there
is
no
response
in
kind
here.
what
the
court
seized
on,
the
majority
seized
on
in
this
case
was
that
they
had
argued
imprisonment
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
comments
by
the
prosecutor
actually...
he
used
the
exact
same
term,
and
it
is
the
only
statutory
alternative
that
an
attorney
has
to
argue
to
a
jury,
and
i
submit
that
that
simply
is
not
invited
error,
and
there
is
simply
no
response
whatsoever.
lastly,
with
regard
to
this
issue,
this
court
decided
ebbits
against
lucy
last
month,
and
we
call
that
to
the
court's
attention
with
regard
to
the
respondent's
argument
that
there
is
an
adequate
independent
state
ground
here
for
the
decision.
i
believe
that
under
lucy
the
failure
by
the
assigned
appellate
counsel
in
this
case
to
claim
this
as
error
would
prevent
the
court,
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
from
reaching
the
merits
with
regard
to
that
issue,
and
accordingly
we
submit
that
it
is
not
an
adequate
state
ground,
and
that
this
court
should
consider
the
merits
of
the
issue.
i
would
lastly
point
out
on
this
issue
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
effect
waived
rule
6b
because
they
invited
counsel
prior
to
the
argument
to
address
that
issue
in
oral
argument.
they
accepted
briefs
on
it,
and
in
fact
they
did
deliberate
and
reach
a
decision
on
that
issue.
and
so
i
think
under
lucy
and
under
just
the
general
law
the
adequacy
of
an
independent
state
ground,
being
itself
a
federal
question,
that
should
not
be
a
bar
here.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
i
don't
see
the
applicability
of
ebbits
at
all.
now,
justice
o'connor,
we
are
getting
into
the
second
phase
of
our
argument.
i
only
see
ebbits
against
lucy
as
bearing
on
the
issue
dealing
with
whether
or
not
there
is
an
adequate
state
ground
by
virtue
of
counsel's
failure
to
comply
with
rule
6b.
if
i
may
go
into
the
facts
with
regard
to
the
second
issue
under
the
sixth
amendment,
there
was
a
pretrial
motion
for
a
psychiatrist,
a
ballistics
expert,
a
fingerprint
expert,
and
a
criminal
investigator.
the
request
for
a
fingerprint
expert
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court
below
was
treated
as
a
request
for
an
expert
with
regard
to
the
foot
cast
evidence,
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
do
so,
and
the
respondent
urged
the
mississippi
supreme
court
to
do
so,
i
believe,
in
their
brief,
and
that
has
been
the
way
the
case
has
proceeded.
the
order
notes
that
the
claim
for
all
these
experts,
including
psychiatrists,
was
made
in
order
to
establish
an
adequate
defense,
and
they
appointed,
the
court
appointed
its
own
expert
in
the
area
of
psychiatry
and
then
denied
the
application
with
regard
to
the
other
experts,
and
they
did
so,
and
i
quote,
"based
on
recent
mississippi
cases",
and
that
is
a
question
as
to
what
they
were
referring
to.
at
the
trial,
these
experts,
there
was
a
ballistics
expert
called
by
the
prosecution,
and
he
testified
in
assisting
the
government
to
make
out
their
prima
facie
case.
the
same
way
with
regard
to
the
foot
cast
expert.
they
tied
the
bullets
taken
from
the
deceased
with
the
gun
taken
from
the
defendant
at
the
time,
and
likewise
the
boots
that
the
defendant
was
wearing
when
he
was
arrested
were
connected
with
footprints
near
the
scene
of
the
accident.
there
was
cross
examination
which
only
really
further
bolstered
the
claim
with
regard
to
the
strength
of
the
ballistics
testimony.
on
summation,
the
prosecutor
highlighted
the
ballistics
testimony
and
then
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
note
to
the
jury
that
it
stood
unimpeached.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
there
was
an
eye
witness.
we
don't
suggest,
justice
rehnquist,
that
there
was
not
other
evidence
in
connection
with
the
prima
facie
case.
there
was
an
eye
witness,
and
there
was
a
glove
that
was
also
found
near
the
scene
of
the
crime
which
had
been
caught
on
a
barbed
wire
fence.
there
was
also...
and
the
matching
glove
was
found
in
the
defendant's
possession.
there
was
also
a
confession
in
the
case.
however,
we
maintain
that
this
is
one
of
the
pieces
that
the
prosecutor
used
to
establish
his
prima
facie
case.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
with
regard
to
this
issue
sustained
a
request...
the
denial
on
two
grounds,
first,
that
under
the
united
states
constitution,
defense
was
not
entitled
to
these
services,
and
secondly,
on
the
ground
that
they
had
failed...
that
defense
counsel
had
failed
to
itemize
the
specific
costs
and
the
purpose
and
the
value
of
these.
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
second
ground
deals
with
the
state's
reimbursement
statute,
which
we
maintain
is
inadequate
on
its
face.
the
respondent
takes
the
position
in
this
court
that
he
doesn't
seek
to
sustain
the
court's
decision
at
all
on
the
constitutional
issue.
they
concede
that,
and
they
concede
that
there
is
a
due
process
right
to
experts
in
this
area.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
concession
is
made
in
an
effort
to
attack
the
petitioner's
case
in
an
area
where
they
consider
it
to
be
weak
and
vulnerable,
namely,
the
failure
to
sufficiently
specify
costs.
however,
we
respectfully
submit
that
because
of
the
statutory
scheme
and
the
unconstitutional...
the
inadequacies
of
that
statutory
scheme,
that
the
application
cannot
be
fairly
judged
under
that,
and
that
the
case
should
be
vacated
and
remanded.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
there
is
not.
justice
o'connor,
the
law
in
mississippi,
however,
has
never
recognized
a
due
process
constitutional
right
to
these
services.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
the
problem
here
is
that
they
are
construing...
let's
say
that
there's
a
statutory
right,
and
that
is
what
the
respondent
says
here.
in
an
appropriate
case,
there
is
a
statutory
right
under
our
reimbursement
statute.
first
of
all,
that
statute
is
being
construed
from
the
point
of
view
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
in
this
area.
secondly,
it
is
inadequate
and
defective
on
its
face
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
it
doesn't
provide
for
an
ex
parte
application,
and
there
are
certain
constitutional
problems
that
arise
from
that.
in
other
words,
defense
counsel,
in
order
to
make
this
application,
has
to
go
to
the
judge
on
notice,
and
this
was
done
in
this
case,
on
notice
to
his
adversary,
and
say,
i
would
like
to
call
an
expert
in
this
area.
they
have
to
tip
off
their
defense.
and
there
is
no
similar
requirement
for
a
non-indigent
to
do
it,
and
so
we
maintain
that
there
is
an
equal
protection
problem
with
that,
because
it
is
creating
a
classification
between
indigents
and
non-indigents.
in
addition,
under
wardius
against
oregon,
which
is
the
reciprocal
alibi
statute
which
the
court
considered,
the
court
said
that
under
due
process
you
can't
have
discovery
on
one
hand
and
not
reciprocal
on
the
other,
and
we
submit
that
the
government
or
the
state
isn't
obliged
to
make
any--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--i
don't
know
if
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
that
doesn't
have
to
do
with
secrets
of
the
defense,
or
strategy
of
the
defense
is
probably
a
better
terminology.
the
mere
fact
that
an
attorney
is
appointed
for
someone
which
under
the
law
is
his
constitutional
right
in
no
way
indicates
to
the
government
or
to
the
state
in
this
case
what
the
strategy
of
defense
counsel
may
be
at
the
trial.
however,
when
you
come
into
court
and
you
make
a
request
for
an
expert,
and
you
want
a
foot
cast
expert,
and
maybe
he
wants
a
criminal
investigator,
or
maybe
he
wants
something
that
the
state
isn't
even
going
to
call,
and
he
has
got
a
good
reason
for
it.
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
imposing
a
burden
on
an
indigent
defendant
in
a
state
trial
to
disclose
items
of
his
defense
strategy,
and
there
is
no
reciprocal
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
that
is
exactly
what
my
point
was.
there
are
two
constitutional
problems
with
it.
one
is
the
wardius
against
oregon
due
process
question
of
non-reciprocal,
and
the
other
is
the
classification
that
this
creates,
because
any
non-indigent
can
get
any
expert
that
he
wants.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
well,
call
to
the
court's
attention,
justice
rehnquist,
the
federal
legislation
in
this
area,
not
that
it
is
constitutionally
mandated
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
comes
from
congress,
obviously,
but
this
has
been
interpreted,
and
i
believe
that
there
are
serious
problems
which
arise
if
you
are
going
to
make
defense
counsel
in
an
indigent
case
tip
his
hand
and
put
his
adversary
on
notice,
this
is
the
very
heart
of
our
criminal
justice
system.
this
court
went
to
great
expense
in
the
cronic
case
to
say
that
this
adversary
system
is
essential
to
rooting
out
the
facts,
and
if
you
are
going
to
require
defense
counsel
representing
an
indigent
to
make
this
kind
of
disclosure
and
not
make
a
reciprocal
obligation,
i
think
you
run
into
due
process
problems--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--and
i
think
that
is
exactly
why
congress
enacted
18
usc
3006
ae,
which
is
the
applicable
statute,
and
expressly
provided
for
ex
parte
application,
and
that
is
the
rule
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
justice
marshall.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
no,
i
think
there
is
more--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--i
think
there
is
more
to
it,
but
i
think
in
this
case,
justice
marshall,
that
the
statutory
requirement
is
intertwined,
inseparably
intertwined
with
the
constitutional
issue,
and
i
believe
that
the
state--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--i
believe
that
the
state
interprets
that
reimbursement
statute
without
recognizing
rights
in
this
area.
it
is
a
matter
of
grace.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
it
is
solely
a
matter
of
statutory
grace
or
discretion.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
in
the
event
that--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
automatic.
i
believe
that
the
states--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--i
believe
in
this
case
that
it
was
self-evident
from
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
was
using
a
fingerprint
expert.
i
think
it
was
self-evident
that
there
was
a
reciprocal
need
here
by
the
defense.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
well--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--they
certainly
did
here.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
i
think
certainly
in
a
case
where
they
have
relied
on
an
expert,
that
it
is
a
reasonable
request,
not
only
to
call
an
expert
on
one's
own
behalf,
but
also
to
effectively
cross
examine.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
obviously,
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
justice--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--justice
marshall,
we
are
talking
about
very,
very
fundamental
concepts
of
justice
here.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
in
the
event
that
this
court
were
to
acknowledge
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
in
this
area,
perhaps
questions
like
that
would
arise,
and
undoubtedly
they
would,
but
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--as
far
as--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--i
certainly
think
you
do.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
application
which
i
submit
to
the
court
it
was
obvious
on
its
face
that
the
prosecution
was
relying
on
experts,
and
for
that
reason
the
court
should
have
been
aware
of
the
value
of
experts
in
this
area.
i
acknowledge,
as
i
have
to,
that
perhaps
in
retrospect
if
this
application
were
redrafted,
it
could
be
somewhat
more
specific,
but
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
defect
in
this
case,
and
if
i
could
just
make
one
other
point
with
regard
to
the
reimbursement
statute,
it
imposes
the
obligation
on
its
face
on
defense
counsel
to
reach
into
his
pocket
and
put
the
money
out.
and
that
creates
all
kinds
of
problems,
because
maybe
defense
counsel
isn't
willing
to
risk
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
when
the
case
is
all
over
may
disallow
that
expense,
and
i
simply
don't
think
that
this
is
a
burden
that
properly
should
be
placed
on
the
individual
counsel.
there
is
a
case
that
my
adversary
cites,
the
ruffin
case,
where--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--no,
he
did
not.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
but
the
mississippi--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
ruffin,
in
denying
the
authorization
on
appeal,
indicated
that
if
this
was
so
important,
then
why
didn't
counsel
go
out
and
fund
raise
for
$500
to
bring
in
the
expert,
and
they
accused
the
defense
counsel
of
sand
bagging
the
court
to
try
to
get
reversible
error.
this
is
the...
i
simply
point
it
out
because
this
is
the
way
that
statute
is
being
interpreted.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
no,
the
statute
on
its
face--
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
--i
am
just
pointing
out,
justice
marshall,
my
point
is,
the
bottom
line,
that
the
statute
for
implementing
any
statutory
right
is
defective
on
its
face
and
defective
as
applied
here.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
thomas
boyle
thank
you.
