mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
initially
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
the
state's
position
on
the
three
issues
that
have
been
raised
in
this
matter.
the
initial
question,
of
course,
concerns
the
propriety
of
advising
the
jury
of
a
condemned
prisoner's
right
of
mandatory
appellate
review.
state
court
resolution
of
this
issue
rested
upon
two
grounds.
the
first
was
procedural,
the
second
substantive.
while
we
feel
that
the
ultimate
resolution
of
the
issue
was
based
on
independent
and
adequate
state
grounds,
that
is,
state
procedural
grounds,
we
shall
concentrate
our
comments
this
morning
upon
the
substantive
aspect
of
the
issue.
within
this
regard,
while
the
mississippi
supreme
court
divided
four
to
four
over
the
state's
argument,
it
unanimously
concluded
that
this
court's
decision
in
california
versus
ramos
was
the
benchmark
from
which
they
must
work,
and
that
the
ultimate
resolution
of
the
issue
was
a
question
of
state
law.
the
second,
the
denial
of
expert
and
investigative
services,
it
is
the
state's
position
that
a
defendant
does
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
expert
or
investigative
assistance
simply
upon
demand.
he
must
demonstrate
to
the
trial
judge
that
the
services
requested
are
both
necessary
and
reasonable.
and
as
for
the
third
question,
the
confrontation
issue,
we
note
that
there
was
no
objection
to
a
portion
of
counsel's
argument
identified
in
the
briefs,
and
that
the
issue
was
not
raised
on
direct
appeal
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
the
issue
is
clearly
barred
under
state
law,
and
we
suggest
that
this
court's
recent
case
in
united
states
versus
young
is
more
or
less
dispositive
of
the
issue.
within
this
regard,
we
suggest
that
certiorari
has
been
improvidently
granted
on
that
particular
issue.
now,
directing
our
comments
to
the
closing
argument
question,
we
note
that
in
particular
there
was
nothing
really
per
se
objectionable
to
defense
counsel's
comments
during
closing
summation.
however,
both
the
trial
judge
and
the
assistant
district
attorney
were
both
of
the
opinion
that
the
argument
left
the
jury
with
the
impression
that
once
a
sentence
of
death
was
returned,
nothing
could
be
done
to
correct
it.
i
believe
the
way
that
the
assistant
district
attorney
termed
it,
that
they
were
going
to
take
the
defendant
out
the
front
door
and
string
him
up
at
that
point
in
time.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
or
his
court
has
basically...
has
consistently
held
that
based
upon
principles
of
comity
and
federalism,
in
particular
the
case
of
donnelly
v.
dechristoforo,
review
is
limited
to
determine
whether
the
arguments
of
counsel
in
state
court
cases
render
the
trial
so
fundamentally
unfair
as
to
deny
the
defendant
due
process.
within
this
regard,
we
note
three
major
points
that
this
court
has
in
the
past
identified
in
questions
concerning
state
court
closing
argument.
this
was
also
recently
stressed
in
the
recent
case
of
united
states
versus
young.
and
that
is,
arguments
must
be
viewed
or
reviewed
within
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
your
honor,
i
am
not
so
sure
that
it
would
have
harmed
the
state's
case.
i
think
what,
in
my
impression
of
reading
the
closing
argument
in
this
case,
was
that
the
state
was
simply
trying
to
inform
the
jury
or
advise
the
jury
that
death
would
not
be
administered
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
fashion.
there
was
a
good
bit
of
discussion
by
state's
counsel
in
this
matter
concerning
the
state
of
the
law
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
furman
v.
georgia,
that
in
essence
what
we
had
was
an
automatic
imposition
of
death
with
basically
a
mercy
clause,
that
then
the
state's
counsel
went
in
and
discussed
this
court's
decision
in
furman,
noting
that
the
court
had
found
those
statutes
that
existed
at
that
time
were
arbitrary,
that
death
was
administered
in
a
capricious
fashion
and
what
not,
then.
the
court
came
down...
the
state's
attorney
noted
that
the
legislature
had
undertaken
to
enact
new
statutes
dealing
with
this
question
in
order
to
funnel
or
to
guide
the
jury's
discretion
to
take
the
arbitrary
aspects
or
the
capricious
aspects
out
of
imposition
of
death.
he
then
went
into
this
court's
discussion
or
this
court's
decision
in
gregg
v.
georgia
and
proffitt
v.
florida,
and
one
thing
that
i
think
is
a
key
point
to
his
argument
was
that
he
stressed,
and
there
are
a
number
of
instances
in
his
closing
argument
where
he
stressed
that
it
was
the
jury's
determination
that
this
court
had
made
its
decision
in
gregg
and
proffitt
to
the
effect
that
it
was
the
jury
who
was
to
decide
what
the
particular
or
what
the
appropriate
punishment
would
be
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
within
a
channel
of
guided
discretion,
as
the
court
has
discussed.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
from
my
reading
of
defense
counsel's
closing
argument,
i
got
the
distinct
impression,
especially
when
they
started
talking
about
the
poem
that
was
written
by
the
prisoner
in
georgia
prior
to
being
executed,
that
in
essence
what
defense
counsel
was
saying,
he
was
trying
to
put
the
blood
of
this
man
on
the
jury's
hands,
was
in
essence
what
they
were
doing.
the
argument
that
was
given
by
defense
counsel
in
essence
said,
if
you
return
this
verdict,
you
are
going
to
kill
the
man.
they
are
going
to
take
him
out
the
front
doors
of
the
courthouse
and
they
are
going
to
string
him
up
in
front
of
the
courthouse.
and
of
course
no
juror
wants
this
particular
burden
upon
his
conscience.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
well,
we
had
already
passed
the
guilt-innocence
phase
at
that
particular
time
and
were
in
sentencing.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
of
course,
that
is
true,
that
if
a
life
sentence
was
returned,
then
of
course
no
one
could
execute
him,
but
what...
our
position
in
this
matter
is
this,
that
there
are
a
line
of
cases,
particularly
emanating
from
the
state
of
lousiana,
cases
such
as
state
v.
berry,
state
v.
matheson,
state
v.
monroe,
and
this
court's
decision
is
maggio
versus
williams,
wherein
it
was
discussed
a
dichotomy
more
or
less
or
a
dual
system
that
they
have
developed
in
lousiana,
and
that
is
where
the
closing
argument
is
addressed
to
dispelling
in
the
jury's
minds
the
question
of
arbitrary
imposition
of
death,
then
such
an
argument
is
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
oh,
i
think
that's
clearly
what
the
law
is,
that
the
state
cannot
make
a
misleading
argument.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
ma'am,
i
think
so,
that--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--well,
i
think
there
is
a
greater
question
that
we
have
to
answer
first,
and
that
is
whether
this
is
a
matter
of
state
law
or
whether
or
not
this
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact,
as
mr.
boyle
commented
on,
that
there
had
been
two
subsequent
decisions
to
caldwell
dealing
with
this
particular
issue
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
that
of
the
case
of
wiley
v.
state
and
the
case
of
williams
v.
state.
in
both
of
those
cases
as
well
as
all
eight
justices
in
this
particular
case
have
noted
that
this
is
a
question
of
state
law,
that
in
wiley
and
in
williams
they
have
exercised
their
supervisory
powers,
and
now
prohibited
arguments
of
this
nature.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
no,
ma'am,
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
under
donnelly
v.
dechristoforo,
that
this
court
made
it
rather
clear
to
the
effect
that
unless
there
is
a
violation
of
a
specific
constitutional
right,
or
that
the
state's
arguments
are
spurious
or
false,
that
those
are
the
bases
upon
which
reversal
will
be
predicated.
i
would
assume
that
a
misleading
argument
would
in
that
nature
be
false
or
spurious.
however,
we
do
preface
it
with
this,
that
this
argument
was
not,
was
not
misleading.
it
did
accurately
state
what
the
law
in
the
state
of
mississippi
was.
the
assistant
district
attorney
told
the
jury
that
it
was
their
responsibility
to
return
a
verdict
of
death,
that
they
were
the
only
ones
under
state
law
who
could
do
that.
however,
he
did
add
to
that
that
it
would
be
reviewed
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
and
of
course
under
state
law
the
mississippi
supreme
court
does
have
the
right.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
for
what.
there
are
a
number
of
items.
they
were
outlined
in
the
case
of
williams
v.
state.
basically
they
are
this.
there
are
three
of
them.
the
court
must
in
performing
what
we
refer
to
in
state
law
as
proportionality
review
or
mandatory
appellate
review,
one,
whether
the
sentence
was
imposed
under
the
influence
of
passion,
prejudice,
or
other
arbitrary
factors,
two,
that
the
evidence
supports
the
aggravating
circumstances,
and
three,
that
the
sentence
is
not
excessive
or
disproportionate.
within
this
regard,
the
court
is
authorized
to
remand
to
the
trial
court
for
modification
of
sentence
to
life
imprisonment.
they
have
done
so
in
at
least
two
cases...
three
cases.
pardon
me.
now--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--that
is
a
difficult
thing
to
explain,
in
that
that
particular
court
in
the
case
of
edwards
v.
state
did
exactly
that,
that
we
had
a
jury
determination
that
hezekiah
edwards
should
be
sentenced
to
death.
in
that
particular
case,
the
evidence
was
clearly
that
the
man
was
not
suffering
from
psychosis.
however,
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
in
reviewing
that
matter,
determined
that
they
did
not
agree
with
the
jury
verdict,
vacated
the
sentence
of
death,
and
sentenced
mr.
edwards
to
life.
now,
there
are
comments
in
this
particular
matter
that
i
don't
particularly
understand.
some
of
the
comments
made
by
the
dissent
i
don't
particularly
understand,
but
mine
is
not
to
know
exactly
what
they
are
talking
about
in
the
matter,
just
to
argue
the
cases
before
them.
within
this
regard,
the
question
as
to
diminished
responsibility
we
suggest
that
this
court's
recent
decision
in
wainwright
versus
witt
and
the
decision
in
donnelly
v.
dechristoforo
mandates
that
deference
be
given
to
the
trial
judge's
determination
as
to
what
was
said.
the
trial
judge
in
this
particular
case
felt
that
defense
counsel's
closing
arguments
were
misleading
to
the
jury,
and
instructed
the
assistant
district
attorney
basically
to
straighten
the
matter
out,
and
this
is
what
he
attempted
to
do,
to
address
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
would
be
taken
out
the
front
of
the
courthouse
and
there
summarily
executed.
a
corollary
to
this
is
a
case
which
is
currently
pending
before
this
court
on
certiorari,
the
case
of
booker
v.
state,
wherein
defense
counsel
is
the
one
that
got
up
at
the
initiation
of
the
proceedings
and
started
talking
about
let's
go
ahead
and
sentence
this
man
to
life,
because
we
have
all
of
these
multiple
appeals
that
we
are
going
to
go
through
in
this
matter.
likewise,
in
this
particular
case,
defense
counsel
discussed
at
great
length
this
court's
decision
in
furman
v.
georgia,
and
noted
that
the
assistant
district
attorney
would
probably
address
comments
in
that
direction.
so
i
think
that
we
do
have
something
here
that
both
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
its
supervisory
capacity
and
the
lower
trial
court
found
not
to
be
particularly
objectionable
under
the
circumstances.
addressing
the
second
point
in
this
matter,
the
expert
witness
question,
there
are
several
things
that
we
need
to,
i
suppose,
straighten
out
in
this.
there
have
been
three
recent
decisions
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
on
this
particular
point.
ruffin
v.
state,
which
is
cited
at
length
in
our
brief,
dufor
v.
state,
and
billiot
v.
state.
billiot
v.
state
gives
a
rather
protracted
recounting
of
the
history
of
this
particular
point
in
the
jurisprudence
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
likewise,
dufor
v.
state
recognizes
the
particular
special
aspects
that
psychological
or
mental
health
professionals
play
within
the
context
of
the
criminal
proceeding.
historically
speaking,
mississippi
has
recognized
the
right
of
an
indigent
offender
to
expert
and
investigative
services.
and
it
consistently
held
that
the
determination
of
whether
to
provide
such
services
must
be
made
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
here,
we
would
note
in
particular
one
thing
that
i
don't
know
has
been
made
abundantly
clear,
and
that
is
that
mr.
caldwell
did
have
the
assistance
of
a
psychiatrist
in
this
matter
appointed
at
state
expense
to
the
tune
of
$70
per
hour.
that
was
dr.
allen
battle
of
memphis,
tennessee.
not
only
did
he
have
that,
but
prior
to
trial
he
was
sent
to
the
mississippi
state
hospital
at
whitfield,
where
he
was
examined
there
by
the
staff
at
the
state
hospital.
apparently
counsel
chose
not
to
use
these
professionals
that
were
given
to
him
for
these
particular
purposes
within
this
case.
substantively
speaking,
and
this
is
something
that
the
petitioner
has
attacked
rather
particularly
here,
and
that
is
section
9915.17,
the
authorization
for
retention
of
these
services,
billiot
v.
state
speaks
to
the
particular
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
applicable,
and
found
that
it
has
been
so.
however,
the
court
by
judicial
definition
has
impressed
upon
the
statutory
authority
the
requirements
that
the
defendant
on
a
motion
to
the
court,
one,
outline
the
specific
cause
that
will
be
involved...
in
this
case
it
was
$70
an
hour
by
dr.
battle...
two,
the
purpose
of
the
services,
why
do
you
need
these
services,
and
three,
the
value
of
the
proposed
testimony
of
the
defendant.
now,
in
this
particular
case
we
must
remember
several
things.
one
was
that
defense
counsel
never
told
the
court
who
he
wanted
retained
as
a
footprint
expert
or
who
he
wanted
retained
as
a
ballistics
expert.
so
there
the
court
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
there
was
no
indication
as
to
what
witness
expert
the
defendant
wanted
in
this
regard.
i
think
that
within
the
overall
constitutional
context,
and
while
i
often
times
do
not
agree
with
this
organization,
i
find
myself
agreeing
with
it
in
this
particular
case,
and
that
is
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
in
their
brief
to
this
court
in
the
case
of
eit
v.
oklahoma.
and
footnote
22
of
their
brief
in
that
particular
matter
i
think
adequately
summarized
what
the
law
was.
our
submission
is
not
that
state
paid
experts
should
be
made
available
to
indigent
defendants
on
demand,
or
that
the
constitution
requires
the
state
to
provide
indigents
with
the
same
quantum
of
assistance
that
a
millionaire
might
choose
to
mobilize
for
his
defense.
we
suggest
that
the
criminal
justice
act's
constitutionally
grounded
standard
of
assistance
necessary
to
an
adequate
defense
and
the
workable
criteria
developed
by
the
federal
courts
and
by
many
state
courts
operating
under
similar
statutes
to
implement
that
standard
may
be
appropriately
applied
to
implement
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
due
process.
in
the
recent
cases
of
ruffin
and
billiot,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
recognized
that
a
due
process
standard
does
exist.
however,
it
has
still
maintained
that
the
principles
that
were
announced
in
bullock
v.
state
and
the
earlier
cases
were
still
applicable
in
that
you
had
to
outline
the
costs,
state
the
purpose
of
the
services,
and
the
value
of
the
proposed
testimony
to
the
defense.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
as
to
the
ballistics
expert
and
the
fingerprint
expert
or
footprint
expert,
the
necessity
of
these
services
has
not
been
shown.
the
man
confessed,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
confessed
to
shooting
the
victim
twice
in
the
head.
he
confessed
that
he
walked
to
the
store
across
the
pasture,
and
he
confessed
that
he
walked
away
from
the
store
across
the
pasture.
consequently,
to
be
frank
with
the
court,
the
expert
services
that
were
used
by
the
state
in
this
matter
were
frankly
immaterial.
where
you
have
a
confession
that
the
man
did
it,
and
the
confession
is
not
questioned
before
this
court,
i
see
no
necessity
for
these
particular
services.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
proper
standard.
the
eleventh
circuit
in
particular
has
developed
a
particular
line
of
cases
which
say
that
where
the
state
has
expert
witnesses
available
for
the
defense
to
talk
to,
to
examine
prior
to
trial,
and
things
of
this
nature,
and
where
there
is
no
showing
that
those
particular
experts
are
biased
toward
the
defendant
or
are
particularly
not...
will
not
consult
with
them
and
things
like
that,
that
that
may
be
of
some
significance,
and
may
necessitate
the
appointment
of
additional
experts.
but
unless
we
are
dealing
with
a
crucial
point
of
evidence,
that
is,
where
it
is
the
pivotal
point
of
evidence
within
the
case,
i
do
not
think
that
the
constitution
mandates
that
such
an
expert
be
appointed
for
defense
counsel
purposes.
likewise
on
the
investigative
assistance
question,
we
note
that
under
the
criminal
justice
act,
there
is
a
$150
maximum
ceiling
placed
on
investigative
services.
within
this
regard,
the
advisory
committee
on
the
criminal
justice
act
has
recommended
to
this
court
that
such
services
be
sparingly
used,
and
that
they
be
viewed
with
great...
graded
severely.
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
35
witnesses,
and
the
motion
noted
that
the
state
had
35
witnesses
that
they
would
call.
however,
we
would
note
from
the
record
that
both
counsel
were
appointed
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case
on
march
the
23rd,
1981.
the
names
and
addresses
of
these
particular
witnesses
were
provided
to
counsel
eight
days
later.
the
matter
was
called
for
trial
some
seven
months
later,
in
october.
consequently,
there
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
time
between
the
actual
appointment
and
the
time
of
trial.
likewise,
we
would
note
that
prior
to
trial,
the
trial
judge
directed
the
state
to
provide
defense
counsel
with
copies
of
the
initial
investigative
interviews
in
these
cases,
and
counsel
had
that
in
order
to
cross
examine
the
particular
witnesses.
we
would
more
or
less
rely
on
our
brief
on
the
third
question
in
this
matter,
and
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will--
