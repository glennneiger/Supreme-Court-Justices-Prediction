mr.
boyle--
justice
marshall
--i
don't
understand
this
tipping
your
hand.
you
have
to
tip
your
hand
when
you
ask
for
a
lawyer,
don't
you?
number
two,
you
don't
think
there
is
any
requirement
other
than
for
the
defendant
to
ask
for
a
particular
expert.
that
is
all
required.
justice
marshall
what
else
would
you
require?
justice
marshall
what
more
would
be
required?
justice
marshall
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
court
really
said,
you
aren't
entitled
to
it,
but
anyhow
the
state
keeps
you
from
getting
it?
that
is
stretching
it
a
little,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
well,
would
you
have
to
get
an
expert
on
fingerprints,
too?
justice
marshall
yes,
in
case
his
fingerprints
are
used,
would
defense
counsel
automatically
get
an
expert
on
fingerprints?
justice
marshall
well,
what
other
than
automatic?
how
much
more
than
automatic?
justice
marshall
have
you
ever
seen
a
case
involving
fingerprints
where
the
government
didn't
put
an
expert
on?
justice
marshall
ever?
justice
marshall
the
first
thing
the
defendant
would
be
up
yelping
that
you
can't
put
them
on
without
an
expert,
wouldn't
he?
justice
marshall
one
final
question.
you
want
the
same
rule
as
in
a
regular
case
where
you
have
a
wealthy
defendant.
suppose
a
wealthy
defendant
brings
an
expert
from
london.
would
you
in
the
next
case
be
entitled
to
that
expert
from
london?
justice
marshall
well,
where
is
your...
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what--
justice
marshall
--i
assume
that
all
constitutional
claims
are
fundamental.
justice
marshall
would
we
need
some
help
from
defense
counsel?
justice
marshall
that
is
what
i
am
asking.
justice
marshall
why
don't
you
give
it
to
me?
justice
marshall
in
this
case,
did
the
judge
ask
counsel
to
put
the
money
up?
justice
marshall
well,
how
is
it
here?
justice
marshall
how
is
that
point
here?
justice
marshall
if
we
take
that
out
of
the
opinion,
will
you
be
satisfied?
justice
marshall
you
can't
do
it.
you
don't
appeal
opinions.
you
appeal
from
judgments.
justice
marshall
suppose
he
argued
that
if
you
find
him
innocent
nobody
can
kill
him?
justice
marshall
but
that
would
be
all
right,
wouldn't
it?
