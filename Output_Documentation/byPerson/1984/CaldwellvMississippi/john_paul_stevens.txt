justice
stevens
mr.
boyd,
may
i
ask
you
one
question
that
just
occurred
to
me?
the
administration
of
the
death...
capital
punishment
is
often
criticized
because
of
the
great
delay
that
elapses
between
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
and
the
carrying
out
of
the
sentence.
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
prejudicial
to
the
prosecutor
if
the
jury
had
the
impression
that
the
sentence
would
be
carried
out
in
a
very
short
period
of
time?
justice
stevens
apparently
the
response
was
needed,
as
i
understand
kind
of
the
preliminary
comment
you
made,
because
it
might
have
been
harmful
to
the
prosecutor's
case
if
the
jury
thought
they
were
going
to
take
him
right
out
immediately
and
implement
the
sentence.
is
that
your
view,
that
the
jury
would
have
a
distorted
view
of
the
case
and
it
would
harm
the
prosecutor
to
think
that
that
sentence
would
be
carried
out
promptly?
justice
stevens
but
all
of
that
just
suggests
to
me
that
there
was
really
no
need
to
respond
to
what
the
defense
counsel
said,
that
basically
it
was
a
jury
decision.
justice
stevens
mr.
boyd,
may
i
ask,
what
do
you
interpret
the
significance
of
the
dissenting
justices'
comment
that
even
a
novice
attorney
knows
that
appellate
courts
do
not
impose
the
death
penalty,
they
merely
review
the
jury
sentence
and
that
it
reviews
with
a
presumption
of
correctness?
i
read
that
to
indicate
that
his
view
was
that
the
prosecutor's
argument
did
not
make
a
full
and
accurate
statement
of
the
function
of
the
reviewing
court.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
think
the
majority
disagreed
with
them.
