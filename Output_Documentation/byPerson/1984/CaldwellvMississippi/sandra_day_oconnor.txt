justice
o'connor
mr.
boyle,
in
your
view,
would
it
be
error
or
a
violation
of
due
process
for
a
court
to
instruct
a
jury
correctly
and
accurately
concerning
the
existence
and
scope
of
appellate
review?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
there
was
any
indication
in
ebbits
against
lucy,
first
of
all,
that
it
extends
to
other
experts
other
than
the
psychiatric
help,
and
secondly,
do
you
think
that
there
is
any
indication
in
it
that
a
state
can't
have
a
rule
that
says
the
defense
has
to
specify
the
cost
in
any
event
and
make
the
other
showing
that
the
state
thinks
would
be
necessary?
justice
o'connor
wasn't
this
a
case
where
there
was
an
eye
witness?
justice
o'connor
mr.
boyle,
is
there
anything
in
the
cases
from
this
court
that
you
find
that
say
a
state
cannot
require
as
prerequisite
the
appointment
of
any
expert--
justice
o'connor
--witnesses
that
there
be
a
threshold
showing
of
need
and
cost
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
why
does
it
need
to?
maybe
it
wants
to
offer
them
whether
or
not
the
constitution
requires
it,
and
if
so,
why
can't
they
have
a
reasonable
rule
requiring
a
threshold
showing?
justice
o'connor
aren't
requests
by
indigent
for
counsel
to
represent
them
matters
that
are
made
with
notice
to
the
other
side?
justice
o'connor
you
said
that
the
problem
is
that
there
can't
be
an
ex
parte
proceeding,
and
requests
by
an
indigent
for
counsel
aren't
done
in
an
ex
parte
setting.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
concede
that
the
state
in
any
event
has
no
right
to
make
an
argument
that
is
misleading
on
the
law?
justice
o'connor
all
right.
so
isn't
the
real
question
whether
it
was
misleading
or
not?
isn't
that
what
we
really
have
to
focus
on?
justice
o'connor
and
the
question
there
is
whether
the
prosecutor's
remarks
indicate
that
the
jury's
verdict
if
they
impose
death
will
be
automatically
reviewed
in
all
its
aspects?
justice
o'connor
it
is
your
position
that
it
does
not
violate
the
federal
constitution
for
a
prosecutor
to
make
a
misleading
argument
to
the
jury?
is
that
your
position?
justice
o'connor
reviewed
for
what,
i
guess
is
the
question.
