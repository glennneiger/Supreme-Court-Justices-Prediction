justice
rehnquist
he
did
a
little
more
than
that,
didn't
he?
justice
rehnquist
but
isn't
that
a
state
law
distinction
in
essence?
i
mean,
would
you
say
the
distinction
vanishes
if
the
mississippi
legislature
had
said
that
juries
ought
to
be
told
about
this,
and
if
your
answer
to
that
is
yes,
why
isn't
the
mississippi
supreme
court
a
perfectly
good
spokesman
for
state
policy,
just
as
the
legislature
would
be?
justice
rehnquist
but
i
thought
your
point
that
you
were
just
making
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
misleading
character,
but
had
something
to
do
about
articulated
state
policy.
justice
rehnquist
then
you
are
saying,
i
guess,
that
a
state
supreme
court
is
not
to
be
given
the
same
deference
as
a
state
legislature
in
speaking
out
on
a
matter
of
state
policy.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
boyle,
do
you
read
young
as
being
a
constitutional
decision?
justice
rehnquist
does
the
opinion
cite
the
due
process
clause.
justice
rehnquist
i
didn't
think
it
did.
justice
rehnquist
even
if
your
contention
were
to
be
upheld,
wouldn't
you
still
have
an
equal
protection
claim?
a
wealthy
criminal
defendant
can
get
all
the
experts
he
wants
without
petitioning
the
court.
justice
rehnquist
but
your
solution
suggests
that
perhaps
to
me
your
definition
of
the
constitutional
right
is
overly
broad,
because
if
the
defendant
is
going
to
have
a
claim
that
i
have
to
petition
the
court
to
get
experts,
and
the
wealthy
defendant
doesn't
have
to
fool
around
with
a
court
at
all,
then
the
only
answer
is
simply
for
the
legislature
to
appropriate
each
year
about
$5
million
or
$10
million
for
whatever
services
criminal
defendants
may
want,
and
i
dare
say
there
aren't
many
courts
that
would
sustain
that
sort
of
a
claim.
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
boyle--
justice
rehnquist
but
can't
the
defendant
say
that
if
a
state
has
sufficient
doubt
about
the
other
evidence
that
it
is
going
to
call
a
ballistics
expert
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
call
one,
too?
