justice
stevens
but
are
there
any...
does
the
record
show
there
are
any
such
vermont
residents?
justice
stevens
what
if
the
facts
were
that
there
were
no
vermont
residents
who
ever
stayed
more
than
three
months
in
illinois
and
also
bought
a
car
there?
i
mean
more
than
three
weeks.
do
we
know
there
are
many
people
in
that
category?
justice
stevens
is
it
that
group
of
people
are
the
only
ones
who
qualify
for
the
exemption?
justice
stevens
so
i
mean
the
legislature
apparently,
as
justice
white
says,
thought
there
were
enough
people
in
that
category
to
justify
creating
a
special
exemption
for
them.
justice
stevens
mr.
eschen,
when
you
recite
the
facts
on
the
other
appellant's
case,
if
you
just
had
the
same
facts
with
respect
to
the
purchase,
the
date
of
the
purchase
and
the
period
of
use
and
all
the
rest,
but
prior
thereto
she'd
been
a
vermont
resident
and
she
had
a
temporary
job
with
an
advertising
agency
in
new
york
or
something,
knowing
she'd
come
back
to
vermont
later,
and
she
went
there,
bought
the
car
at
the
same
time,
and
then
brought
it
back,
would
she
have
to
pay
the
use
tax?
justice
stevens
of
vermont,
before
she
bought...
at
the
time
she
bought
the
car,
but
she
was
temporarily
employed
in
new
york
for
a
period
of
a
year
or
two;
she
had
bought
it
for
the
same
price,
everything
else
was
exactly
the
same;
would
she
pay
the
tax?
justice
stevens
what
you're
saying
then
is,
there
really
is
no
discrimination
at
all.
justice
stevens
let
me
interrupt
you
if
i
may.
i
don't
think
you
should
be
giving
us
examples
of
purchases
in
vermont
because
nobody
claims
any
discrimination
based
on...
aren't
they
just
based
on
purchases
either
in
new
york
or
illinois
or
out
of
state?
justice
stevens
and
isn't
that
all
that
the
supreme
court
dealt
with
was
purchases
out
of
state?
i
mean
as
i
understand
it,
that's
the
claimed
discrimination.
and
you're
saying
there
is
no
such
discrimination,
and
then
you
give
us
an
example
of
a
purchase
in
vermont,
which
just
confuses
the
issue
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
stevens
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
again?
i'm
sorry.
i
really
am
getting
in
trouble
here.
are
you
telling
us
that
in
our
hypothetical
examples,
if
the
vermont
resident
that
registered
the
car
in
new
york,
that
he
would
be
denied
the
exemption?
justice
stevens
but
the
supreme
court
says
the
contrary
in
its
opinion.
"residents
who
purchase
pleasure
cars
outside
the
state
and
pay
a
sales
or
use
tax
to
another
state
are
exempt
from
paying
a
use
tax
to
the
state
of
vermont.
"
you're
disagreeing
with
that.
that's
page
21
and
22a
of
the...
if
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
stevens
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
vermont
supreme
court
statement
that
i
just
read?
justice
stevens
the
statement
says:
"residents
who
purchase
pleasure
cars
outside
the
state.
"
--this
is
somebody
in
new
york
now--
justice
stevens
"#
and
pay
a
sales
or
use
tax
to
another
state.
"
--to
new
york--
justice
stevens
"#
are
exempt
from
paying
a
use
tax
to
the
state
of
vermont.
"
is
that
true
or...
it
goes
and
says,
"at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
tax
provided
there
is
a
reciprocal
arrangement.
"
and
i
assume
all
of
that
is
complied
with.
justice
stevens
well,
is
vermont...
is
new
york
a
reciprocal
state?
justice
stevens
so
then
it
is
exempt
here,
even
if
it's
not
registered...
there
is
no
reference
to
registration
in
the
state.
justice
stevens
do
you
agree
or
disagree
that
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law
of
vermont?
justice
stevens
so
why
doesn't
that
apply
to
him,
too?
justice
stevens
your
other
hypothetical,
we
have
this
woman
who
goes
to
new
york
and
lives
for
a
year
and
works
for
an
advertising
agency,
wants
to
work
there
for
a
year
in
new
york,
but
she
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
tax,
if
i
understand
your--
justice
stevens
--this
is
based
on...
anyway,
that's
what
you
say
the
law
is,
although--
justice
stevens
--well,
how
are
we
supposed
to
resolve
this
question
of
what
the
law...
should
we
certify
a
question
to
the
vermont
supreme
court
and
say
did
you
really
mean
what
you
said?
how
do
we
do
this?
we've
got
to
decide
a
case
here.
justice
stevens
i
never
have
seen
one
like
this
before
where
the
opinion
is
perfectly
clear,
and
then
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
comes
up
and
says
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
didn't
know
what
it
was
talking
about.
justice
stevens
to
say
the
least.
