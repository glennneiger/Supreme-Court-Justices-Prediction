justice
blackmun
mr.
williams,
you're
the
illinois
one,
rather
than
the
new
york
one
in
this
case?
justice
blackmun
could
it
be
said
that
your
real
argument
is
not
with
vermont,
but
with
illinois?
justice
blackmun
which,
after
all,
doesn't
grant
you
a
refund
even
though
you're
out
there
just
a
short
time.
and
you
could
make
an
argument
with
illinois,
i
suppose,
that
you
didn't
use
their
roads
for
12
months
and
so
ought
to
get
a
refund.
isn't
that
your
problem,
rather
than
vermont?
justice
blackmun
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
residents
of
vermont
don't
pay
vermont
anything?
justice
blackmun
mr.
williams,
did
you
have
to
pay
a
sales
tax
in
illinois
when
you
bought
your
car?
justice
blackmun
would
a
vermont
resident
buying
a
car
in
illinois
have
to
pay
a
sales
tax?
justice
blackmun
suppose
he
didn't.
suppose
he
stayed
there
two
weeks
and
bought
a
car
in
illinois.
justice
blackmun
he
would
have
a
what?
justice
blackmun
so
he
need
not
pay
a
sales
tax?
justice
blackmun
then
the
differentiation
between
the
illinois
resident
and
the
vermont
resident
buying
a
car
in
illinois
is
not
so
great
after
all.
justice
blackmun
well,
suppose
he
didn't
use
it
in
illinois
at
all.
he
just
knew
a
dealer
and
he
gave
him
a
good
deal,
and
he
bought
it
and
shipped
it
right
to
vermont.
he
wasn't
using
illinois
roads,
as
you
were.
justice
blackmun
well,
whatever
you
were,
you
were
a
resident
of
illinois.
justice
blackmun
where
did
you
live
for
the
five
years
before
you
moved
to
vermont?
justice
blackmun
where?
justice
blackmun
in
where?
justice
blackmun
is
this
when
you
worked
for
cudare
brothers?
