mr.
norman
charles
williams
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
appeal
challenges
discrimination
between
residents
and
non-residents
under
the
vermont
motor
vehicle
purchase
and
use
tax.
we
believe
that
discrimination
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
we
also
believe
that
the
statute
violates
the
commerce
clause.
everyone
who
moves
to
vermont
and
owns
a
car
has
to
pay
a
4
percent
tax
on
the
value
of
their
car
when
they
register
it
in
vermont.
residents
in
exactly
the
same
circumstances
pay
no
tax.
let
me
tell
you
how
the
tax
system
works.
nominally,
everyone,
every
individual
who
first
registers
a
car
in
vermont
is
required
to
pay
a
4
percent
tax.
however,
residents
of
vermont
who
buy
cars
in
other
states
are
granted
a
credit
for
taxes
paid
to
the
other
state.
nonresidents
in
exactly
the
same
circumstances
are
denied
that
credit.
in
effect,
this
means
that
a
vermont
resident
who
goes
to
illinois
and
buys
a
car,
pays
an
illinois
tax
of
7
percent,
comes
back
to
vermont
and
registers
the
car
there,
pays
no
tax
to
the
state
of
vermont.
an
illinois
resident
in
exactly
the
same
situation
goes
to
exactly
the
same
dealership
on
exactly
the
same
day,
pays
the
tax,
buys
the
car,
pays
the
tax
of
7
percent,
moves
to
vermont.
when
that
person
registers
his
car
in
vermont,
he
pays
a
4
percent
tax
to
the
state
of
vermont.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
no,
they
don't.
if
a
vermont
resident
bought
a
car
in
illinois
and
stayed
for
only
two
or
three
weeks
or
bought
a
car
in
new
york
and
stayed
for
only
two
or
three
weeks,
in
that
case
they
would
have
an
option.
they
would
not
have
to
pay
illinois
or
new
york.
but
let's
take
the
case
of,
for
example,
an
executive
who
is
transferred
to
illinois
for
three
months;
buys
a
car
in
illinois
for
his
stay
there.
he
has
got
to
pay
the
illinois
tax
in
order
to
drive
that
car
in
illinois
for
three
months.
other
situations
might
be
retirees
who
went
to
florida
and
stayed
over
the
winter.
they
would
have
to
pay
a
tax
to
florida.
when
they
got
back
to
vermont,
they
would
get
a
credit
for
the
tax
paid.
so
i
don't
think
it's
true
of...
if
you
stay
for
only
two
or
three
weeks,
you
have
a
choice.
other
than
that,
you
have
to
pay
to
the
other
state.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
well,
the
person
who
stays
longer
than
two
or
three
weeks,
just
like
the
appellants
stayed
longer
than
two
or
three
weeks
after
they
bought
their
cars
in
illinois
and
new
york.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
there's
no
record
in
this
case
because
it
comes
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
i
think
we
have
to
assume
it,
because
it's
a
motion
to
dismiss.
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
judicial
notice,
it
is
undoubtedly
clear
that
there
are
people
who
go
to
california,
college
students
who
go
to
california
for
a
year,
or
people
that
are...
business
executives
that
are
transferred
for
three
months,
a
year,
two
years;
retirees
that
go
to
florida;
people
that
go
on
a
long
vacation.
there's
any
number
of
situations
that
one
can
imagine
where
a
vermonter
would
buy
a
car
in
a
distant
state
and
not
register
in
vermont,
but
register
in
the
other
state.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
i
don't
think
it
could--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--i
have
no
problem
with
illinois.
i
think
illinois
treated
me
fairly.
i
would
have
no
problem
under
the
equal
protection
clause
or
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
with
vermont
if
vermont
charged
me
a
4
percent
tax
that
it
also
charged
to
all
its
residents.
my
problem
is
with
vermont
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
because
residents
of
vermont
don't
pay
vermont
anything,
but
i
pay
vermont
4
percent.
and
so
does
everyone
that
moves
to
vermont.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
a
resident
who
purchases
a
car
in
another
state
and
pays
a
tax
to
another
state,
like
me,
pays
vermont
nothing
because
that
resident
gets
the
credit
for
the
taxes
paid
in
the
other
state
which
i
do
not
get.
i'd
also
add
that
in
1980,
until
1980,
i
would
have
been
treated
the
same
as
a
vermont
resident.
but
in
that
year,
the
vermont
legislature
repealed
the
exemption
that
would
have
applied
to
me,
evidently
in
an
effort
to
raise
some
funds.
there's
no
legislative
history
on
the
repeal
at
all,
but
that's
what
happened.
so
i
believe
that
the
discrimination
violates--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--the
statute
says...
the
statute
plainly
says
that
any
vermont
resident
who
purchases
a
car
in
another
state
and
pays
a
tax
in
another
state
is
entitled
to
a
credit.
so
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
that's
the
way
the
vermont
supreme
court
has
interpreted
the
statute,
the
vermont
superior
court
has
interpreted
the
statute.
there
is
no
suggestion
anywhere
that
that
isn't
the
case.
i
think
any
time
a
vermont
resident
pays
a
tax
to
another
state
he
gets
a
credit,
which
isn't
true
when
a
nonresident
does
the
same
thing.
i
think
the
tax
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
infringes
the
right
to
travel.
it
sets
up
a
barrier
for
people
coming
to
vermont.
it
happens
to
be
a
tax
on
a
car;
it
could
be
a
tax
on
any
other
property.
the
point
is
that
it's
a
tax
imposed
on
nonresidents
that
isn't
imposed
on
residents
in
the
same
circumstances.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
well,
that's
certainly
one
way
to--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--right.
that
is
the
basis
for
my
equal
protection.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
right.
i
would
only
point
out
that
it
is
true
that
i
was
a
resident
at
the
time.
there's
no
requirement
that
i
had
to
be
a
resident
to
register
a
car.
anybody
can
register
a
car
in
vermont
without
being
a
resident.
so
that
is
the
basis
of
my
equal
protection
claim;
correct.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
well,
i
think
that
it
does
happen.
i
think
that
especially
because
of
different
insurance
rates,
people
in
neighboring
states
often
register
their
cars
in
vermont.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
yes.
i
think
it
does
happen
and
i--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--it's
not
my
case
at
all;
no.
i
just
note
that
it
does
go
on.
i
believe
that
there's
no
rational
basis
for
that
sort
of
discrimination.
however,
i
believe
the
strict
scrutiny
test
is
the
test
to
apply
because--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--absolutely,
your
honor.
but
why
should
vermont
be
able
to
charge
me
and
not
charge
a
resident
for
the
use
of
the
roads?
that
is
the
problem
that
i
have
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
well,
that
would
be
one
way
to
cure
the
equal
protection
claim.
i
agree.
i
think
that
in
order
to
do
that,
the
legislature
would
have
to
face
the
entire
constituency
of
vermont.
it
wouldn't
be
able
to
discriminate
just
against
nonresidents
who
don't
have
a
voice
in
the
legislature.
however,
they
could
certainly
do
that.
i
think
that
would
raise
commerce
clause
questions,
which
i
address
in
part
three
of
the
brief.
but
i
think
that
it
would
take
care
of
the
discrimination.
i
also
think
this
tax...
the
discrimination
violates
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
under
cases
like
zobel
or
cases
like
austin
v.
new
hampshire
and
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
in
zobel,
not
the
main
opinion
in
zobel.
in
austin,
this
court
said
clearly
that
a
state
cannot
impose
a
higher
tax
burden
on
nonresidents
than
it
does
on
residents
in
exactly
the
same
circumstances.
that
is
one
right
that
is
protected
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
no.
that's
not
my
contention.
i
used--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
no.
i
don't
think
it's
wrong
that
vermont
should
be
able
to
charge
me
a
tax.
i
think
it's
wrong
that
vermont
should
be
able
to
charge
me
a
tax
but
that
it
does
not
charge
a
tax
to
residents
in
the
same
circumstances.
i
think
it's
wrong
that
i
have
to
pay
when
a
vermont
resident
does
not
have
to
pay
anything.
i
don't
object
to
paying
it.
i
just
want
to
pay
on
the
same
basis
as
a
vermont
resident
in
my
situation.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
privileges
clause
protects
unequal
taxation
burdens,
protects
nonresidents
against
unequal
taxation
burdens,
and--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--i--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--i
checked
the
census,
and
it
appears
to
me
that
about
14,000
people
are
moving
to
vermont
every
year.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
percentage
of
those
people
own
cars.
perhaps
a
third,
a
fourth
of
those
people
own
cars.
the
attorney
general
has
said
that
the
tax
brings
in
about
a
million
dollars
a
year.
this...
what
i
think
is
the
illegal
part
of
the
tax
brings
in
about
a
million
dollars
a
year
to
the
state
of
vermont.
but,
of
course,
none
of
this
is
in
the
record
because
this
comes
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
once
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
applies,
then
the
court
is
to
look
at
whether
nonresidents
constitute
a
peculiar
source
of
evil.
in
this
case
i
suppose,
do
nonresidents
do
a
disproportionate
share
of
road
damage?
and
i
think
it's
obvious
that
they
don't.
i
think
that
residents
who
don't
pay
any
tax
probably
do
just
as
much
damage,
if
not
more
damage,
to
roads.
trucks
just
passing
through
do
damage;
recreational
vehicles,
trailers,
all
sorts
of
cars
do
road
damage...
people
who
don't
pay
taxes.
so
there's
no
basis
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
for
charging
this
discriminatory
tax.
the
final
point--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--yes.
i
paid
a
7
percent
tax.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
yes,
if
that
vermont
resident
stayed
longer
than
the
two
or
three-week
minimum
required
by--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--then
he
would
have
a
choice.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
he
would
have
a
choice,
i
think,
about
whether
to
pay
illinois
or
wait
until
he
got
back
to
vermont.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
that's
right;
if
he
left
within
two
weeks
he
need
not
pay
a
sales
tax.
in
that
connection,
i
point
out
what
the
court
said
in
austin.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
yes,
that's
right.
in
that
case,
the
vermonter
pays
the
exact
same
amount
that
i
paid
to
vermont.
but
that
vermonter
isn't
in
the
same
situation
because
i,
like
i
suppose
almost
everyone
who
moves
to
vermont,
used
my
car
in
illinois
longer
than
two
weeks
after
i
bought
it.
and
any
vermonter
in
that
same
situation
would
also
pay
the
tax.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
that's
right.
he
wouldn't
have
to
pay
a
tax
to
illinois.
in
fact,
he
could
use
illinois
roads
for
two
weeks.
but
the
point
is,
i
think,
that
someone
in
my
situation
that
used
the
roads
of
illinois
for
two
months
before
moving
to
vermont...
let's
say
that
i
was
a
law
clerk.
someone
down
the
hall
is
a
vermont
law
clerk;
we're
both
in
chicago.
that
person
buys
a
car--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--i
paid
a
tax
to
illinois.
i'm
not
sure
i
was
a
resident
of
illinois.
i
paid
a
tax
to
illinois
when
i
bought
my
car.
i
don't
think
that
that
point
is
in--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--i
lived
in
paris,
france.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
i
lived
in
paris,
france.
[laughter]
mr.
norman
charles
williams
in
france.
and
i
came
back
to
illinois
and
bought
a
car
and
moved
to
vermont.
[laughter]
mr.
norman
charles
williams
that's
right.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
if
i
had
lived
in
vermont
when
i
ordered
the
car?
i
think
that
illinois
would
not
have
required
me
to
pay
a
tax
if
i
ordered
the
car
in
illinois.
and
then
i
would
have
had
to
pay
the
4
percent
tax
to
vermont.
i
think,
though,
just
to
say
it
once
more,
people
in
the
same
situation,
vermont
residents
in
the
same
situation
that
i
was
in
in
illinois
would
pay
the
tax...
would
get
a
credit.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
well,
as
you
say
it's
not...
i
the
record
i
suggested
some
examples.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
all
that
rare.
i
think
any
vermonter
who
found
himself
in
another
state
for
a
couple
of
months,
especially
a
distant
state,
might
well
decide
to
buy
a
car,
to
use
it
while
he
was
there
in
that
other
state.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
right.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
right.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
any
vermont
resident
who
pays
a
tax
to
another
state
qualifies
for
the
exemption.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
exactly.
i
think
that
even
apart
from
the
discrimination,
the
tax
violates
the
commerce
clause
because
even
if,
as
justice
white
suggested,
the
discrimination
was
removed
and
everyone
who
bought
a
car
in
another
state
had
to
pay
a
4
percent
tax
to
vermont
which
is
the
case
in
four
other
states
right
now,
in
that
case
everyone
would
face
a
substantial
incentive
to
buy
their
car
in
vermont
for
tax
reasons
alone.
for
example,
if
i
was
moving
to
vermont
and
the
prices
of
the
cars
were
within
a
couple
of
percentage
points
of
each
other,
it
would
be
smarter
for
me,
more
economical
for
me
to
wait
until
i
sell
my
car
in
illinois,
move
to
vermont,
and
buy
a
car.
that
way
i
would
pay
4
percent.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
if
i
was
in
illinois
and
i
needed
a
car
and
it
would
be
reasonable
for
me
to
buy
one
to
move,
it
would
be
much
better
for
me
to
wait.
if
i
bought
it
in
illinois,
i
would
pay
a
7
percent
tax.
i
would
move
to
vermont.
there
might
be
some
slight
deterioration
of
the
car
that
might
be
worth
slightly
less,
but
i
would
still
pay
4
percent
more.
so
i
would
have
a
tax
of
11
percent
or
almost
11
percent.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
that's
right,
and
move--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--well,
that's
right,
except
that
it
would
certainly
be
convenient,
once
i
had
moved
to
vermont,
to
buy
in
vermont.
i
take
your
point
though.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
that's
certainly
what
happened
to
me.
[laughter]
mr.
norman
charles
williams
yes.
that
issue
has
never
been
decided.
i
think
what--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--well,
i
know
that
there
are
members
of
this
court
who
feel
that
henneford
may
have
even
decided
that
issue,
but
i
don't--
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--i
don't
think
so
at
least.
and
i
think
that
most
of
the
members
of
this
court
don't
think
that
that
issue
was
reached.
i
think
that
the
analysis
under
henneford
may
have
changed
in
the
years...
in
the
50
years
since
it
was
decided.
i
think
that
what
has
been
decided
since
henneford
is
that
a
state
may
charge
a
reasonable...
for
use
of
its
own
resources...
in
this
case,
roads...
may
charge
a
fairly
apportioned
fee
or
tax
for
that.
in
this
case,
the
fee
isn't
apportioned.
it
is
a
one-time
fee,
a
one-time
tax
that
has
very
little,
if
anything,
to
do
with
actual
use
or
actual
damage
to
the
roads.
and
it's
because
it
isn't
apportioned
that
it
calls
into
question
the
commerce
clause
under
what
i
think
is
the
modern
analysis.
because
it
isn't
apportioned,
it
creates
this
incentive
to
change
your
purchasing
decision
based
on
the
tax
alone.
mr.

charles

yes.
if
all
50
states...
i
think
under
the
modern
analysis,
the
analysis
in
arco
v.
hardesty...
if
all
50
states
had
a
tax
like
this,
a
person
that
was
moving
would
wait,
would
always
wait
until
they
were
in
the
state
of
destination.
a
person
who
was
already
in
a
state
wouldn't
buy
in
another
state
because
he'd
have
to
pay
tax
twice.
and
that's
the
kind
of
burden
on
interstate
commerce
that
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
allow
under
the
modern
analysis.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
norman
charles
williams
--if
the
court
has
no
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
