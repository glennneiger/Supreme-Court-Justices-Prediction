justice
marshall
maybe
this
is
way
out
in
left
field,
but
how
many
people
are
in
the
same
position
you're
in--
justice
marshall
--would
you
estimate?
justice
marshall
were
both
of
them
residents
of
the
other
state
when
they
purchased
the
car?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
my
problem
is
that
if
you
pay
a
tax
in
a
state
and
then
you
move
to
another
state
and
you
have
a
personal
property
tax,
automatically
you
are
subject
to
that
tax.
justice
marshall
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
marshall
i
know
that.
but
isn't
that
true
in
the
personal
property
tax
states?
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
this
the
same?
wouldn't
this
be
governed
by
the
same
rule
as
the
personal
property
tax
would?
justice
marshall
can
you
think
of
any
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be?
i
mean
when
these
people
buy
a
car
in
another
state
and
abide
by
all
the
rules
of
that
state
which
uses
the
money
to
keep
its
roads,
then
it
moves
to
another
state,
i
think
your
argument,
is
it,
so
to
abide
by
those
rules.
justice
marshall
but
he
says
that
if
you
were
a
resident
of
the
state
when
you
bought
the
car
in
the
other
state,
then
you
get
a
credit.
justice
marshall
the
registry
is
what...
the
registering
is
what
starts
it.
justice
marshall
what
causes
it.
justice
marshall
to
register
in
another
state.
if
they
hadn't
registered,
they'd
get
a
credit.
justice
marshall
all
right.
the
appellant
in
this
case
buys
a
car
in
new
york,
registers
it
in
new
york,
and
lets
it
sit
in
the
garage
for
three
months,
and
then
brings
it
to
vermont,
what
happens?
justice
marshall
i
didn't
say
they
registered
it.
they
didn't
register
it
in
new
york.
justice
marshall
if
he
kept
it
in
the
garage
for
three
months
and
brought
it
into
vermont,
they'd
get
the
benefit
of
this
tax,
if
they
didn't
register.
justice
marshall
they
didn't
register
in
new
york
for
three
months.
justice
marshall
and
then
they
brought
it
to
vermont
and
registered
it,
they
would
have
the
benefit
of
that
deduction.
justice
marshall
i
thought
you
said
the
registering
is
what
triggered
it.
