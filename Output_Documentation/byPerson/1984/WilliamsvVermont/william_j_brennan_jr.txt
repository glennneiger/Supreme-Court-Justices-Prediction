justice
jr.
mr.
williams,
i
guess
it's
50
years
ago
now
that
in
silas
mason,
justice
cardozo
said
this:
a
state,
for
many
purposes,
is
to
be
reckoned
as
a
self-contained
unit
which
may
frame
its
own
system
of
burdens
and
exceptions
without
heeding
systems
elsewhere.
if
there
are
limits
to
that
power,
there
is
no
need
to
mark
them
now.
there
will
be
time
enough
to
mark
then
when
a
taxpayer
paying
in
the
state
of
origin
is
compelled
to
pay
again
in
the
state
of
destination.
is
that
this
case?
justice
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering.
has
this
issue
been
open
for
over
50
years
now?
justice
jr.
what's
the
closest
we've
come
to
it?
justice
jr.
that's
what
i
was--
justice
jr.
--and
that
burdens
commerce
because
it
discourages
buying
in
illinois
in
favor
of
buying
in
vermont?
