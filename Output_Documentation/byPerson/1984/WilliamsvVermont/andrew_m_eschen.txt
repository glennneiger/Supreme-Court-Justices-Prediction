mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
1978
susan
levine,
one
of
the
appellants
in
this
case,
purchased
a
brand
new
1979
chrysler
horizon
in
new
york
state.
at
the
time
of
the
purchase,
she
was
a
resident
of
new
york.
under
new
york
law,
she
was
obligated
to
pay
that
state's
sales
tax,
and
she
paid
that
state
sales
tax.
if
she
wanted
to
use
the
car
in
new
york,
she
was
obligated
to
register
the
car,
so
she
registered
the
car
and
she
used
the
car
there
for
over
a
year.
then,
in
an
act
of
her
own
free
will,
she
decided
to
become
a
vermont
resident
and
she
moved
to
vermont
and
she
engaged
in
employment
in
the
state.
she's
been
in
vermont
since
1979
and
she's
been
using
her
vehicle
in
the
state
since
1979.
she
registered
her
car
in
1982,
and
at
that
time
the
state
of
vermont
simply
asked
if
you
are
going
to
use
your
car
on
our
highways,
you
should
pay
a
fee;
you
should
pay
the
same
fee
that
we
ask
of
any
other
individual
who
wants
to
use
a
car
in
the
state
of
vermont.
and
the
state
of
vermont
imposed
a
use
tax,
ad
the
use
tax
was
based
upon
the
value
of
the
vehicle
as
of
the
time
it
was
registered
in
the
state
of
vermont,
as
of
the
time
she
became
a
resident
of
the
state
of
vermont.
she
had
used
the
car
for
over
three
years.
the
car
had
depreciated.
accordingly,
the
use
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
vermont
was
$110.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
that's
correct,
your--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--that's
right,
your
honor.
unlike
several
other...
many
other
states...
according
to
my
research
there
are
about
35
other
states
that
impose
an
annual
property
tax
or
an
annual
excise
tax
on
automobiles.
the
only
obligation
in
vermont
is
to
pay
the
purchase
or
use
tax
and
then
there's
an
annual
$36
renewal
on
the
registration.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
no,
your
honor.
the
tax--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
if
you're
assuming
that
ms.
levine
was
a
resident
of--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--your
honor,
that
brings
into
question
the
credit
provision
found
in
section
8911.9
of
title
32
and
how
that
applies.
the
credit
provision
is
available
to
a
resident
of
vermont
who
purchases
a
pleasure
car
in
a
reciprocal
state
and
first
registers
it
in
the
state
of
vermont.
if
she,
as
a
resident
of
vermont,
had
purchased
the
car
in
new
york,
had
registered
the
car
in
new
york
and
then
later
returned
to
vermont,
she
would
not
receive
credit
from
the
state
of
vermont.
she
is
still
a
legal
resident
of
the
state
of
vermont
and
would
still
be
obligated
to
register
the
car
in
vermont
if
she
wanted
to
use
it
in
the
state,
and
when
she
registered
the
car
she
would
be
obligated--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--you're
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
the
only
situation,
your
honor,
in
which
the
credit
is
available
is
when
a
resident
of
vermont
purchases
the
car
in
a
reciprocal
state
and
first
registers
the
car
in
the
state
of
vermont.
the
legislature,
when
it
enacted
section
8911.6--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--that's
correct.
it
was
observed
in
a
west
virginia
supreme
court--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--that's
true.
in
some...
from
my
research
i
found
three
states...
there
are
only
three
states
that
i
have
been
able
to
locate
which
actually
impose
a
sales
tax
on
nonresidents,
period.
every
other
state
pretty
much
provides
that
if
a
nonresident
purchases
a
car
in
that
state,
provided
that
the
nonresident
does
not
register--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--i
would
have
to
say
that
it
is
not.
i
think--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--no,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
the
decision
does
not
specifically
say
what
i
have
just
said.
i
argued
the
case
before
the
vermont
supreme
court
and--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
give
to
this
court
the
same
examples
that
i
used
before
the
vermont
supreme
court
to
explain
how
the
tax
scheme
operates.
using
ms.
levine
as
an
example,
she
was
liable
to
vermont
for
$110
when
she
became
a
resident
and
registered
the
vehicle
in
the
state.
the
tax
was
based
upon
a
1979
chrysler
horizon,
registered
in
the
state
as
of
1982
when
she
became
a
resident.
if
a
resident,
at
the
same
time
that
she
registered
her
car
in
vermont,
had
purchased
the
identical
chrysler
horizon,
1979
model,
had
purchased
it
in
vermont,
he
would
have
paid
to
vermont
a
purchase
tax
of
4
percent
or
$110,
the
same
amount
that
was
requested
of
ms.
levine.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
well,
your
honor,
even
using
the
examples
of
purchases
out
of
state,
i'd
still--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--well,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--is
that
any
individual
who
is
registering
that
same
car
in
vermont,
regardless
of
where
the
vehicle
may
have
been
purchased,
is
going
to
pay
$110.
the
resident
who
buys
it
in
vermont
pays
$110.
the
resident--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--i
realize
that.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
i
realize
that,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
well,
your
honor,
i
admit
that
it
is
a
difficulty
in
this
case
because
the
decision
of
the
vermont
supreme
court
does
not
specifically
address
the
first
registration
principle
that
i've
discussed.
however,
it
was
discussed,
it
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention,
and
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
discrimination.
the
commissioner
of
motor
vehicles
of
the
state
of
vermont
is
empowered
to
administer
the
act.
section
8911.9
has
an
ambiguity
in
it
in
the
form
of
the
word
"acquired".
in
contrast
to
other
credit
provisions
in
section
8911,
the
legislature
has
chosen
to
use
the
word
"acquired"
rather
than
"owned"
or
"purchased"
or
"used".
this,
we
submit,
created
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute
as
to
when
the
credit
provision
should
be
applied.
however,
the
legislature
has
specifically
stated
in
section
8901
that
the
purpose
of
the
tax
was
to
raise
revenue
for
the
maintenance
and
improvement
of
the
state
highway
system.
the
tax
is
imposed
on
users.
anybody
who
is
going
to
use
the
state
highways,
who
is
a
resident--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
the
credit
provision,
even
if
the
court
were
to
resume
mr.
williams'
application,
the
credit
provision
is
available
to
a
resident
of
vermont.
there
is
no
durational
requirement.
anybody
who
is
a
resident
of
vermont
who
subsequently
purchases
an
automobile
is
entitled
to
the
credit.
it
is
a
tax
expenditure
by
the
state
of
vermont.
the
credit--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--that's
correct.
the
reason,
your
honor,
i
think
is
plain.
in
mr.
williams'
example,
in
ms.
levine's
case,
they
had
purchased
their
cars
as
residents
of
those
states
and
they
wanted
to
use
their
cars
in
those
states,
and
they
used
their
cars
in
those
states.
ms.
levine
used
her
car
in
new
york
for
over
a
year.
mr.
williams
used
his
car
in
illinois
for
over
two
months.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
were
both
of
them
residents?
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
the
complaint
in
the
case--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--your
honor,
this
is
no
personal--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--this
is
not
a
personal
property
tax.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
that
if
the
item
comes
to
rest
in
the
other
state
and
it
becomes
a
part
of
the--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--i
would
think
that
it
would.
i
would
think
that
it
would.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
that's
true,
your
honor.
that
was
one
of
my
arguments
under--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--your
honor,
if
you
were
a
resident
of
the
state
of
vermont
and
you
purchased
the
car
in
a
reciprocal
state
and
did
not
register
the
car
in
that
state
and
brought
it
back
to
vermont
and
first
used
it
in
vermont,
you
would
get
the
credit.
but
the
situation
in
that
case
in
that--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--the
registration--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--triggers
the
tax.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
no.
if
the
appellants,
as
residents
of
their
prior--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--that
individual
would
be
liable
to
the
state
for
a
use
tax
based
upon
the
value
of
the
tax...
based
upon
the
value
of
the
vehicle
as
of
the
time
of
registration.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
that's
what
i'm
saying.
if
he
did
not--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--but
they
did
register
it
in
vermont.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
right.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
no,
they
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
the
registration
in
vermont
triggers
the
tax
liability
in
vermont.
prior
to
the
time
a
person
becomes
a
resident,
he
has
no
obligation
to
register
the
vehicle.
once
he
becomes
a
resident,
he's
obligated
to
register
the
vehicle,
at
which
point
the
tax
is
imposed.
in
the
situation
where
a
nonresident
purchases
a
car
in
his
own
state
and
then
brings
it
to
vermont
and
registers
it
in
vermont,
he
will
not
receive
a
credit.
the
credit
is
available
to
a
resident
of
vermont
who
subsequently
acquires
the
motor
vehicle
and
first
registers
it
in
the
state
of
vermont.
if
he
first
registers
it
outside
the
state
of
vermont
and
brings
it
back
to
vermont
and
registers
it
in
vermont,
he
will
be
denied
the
credit.
the
reasoning
is,
the
purpose
of
the
credit
provision
was
simply
to
enable
vermonters
to
take
advantage
of
the
extensive,
relatively
extensive
automobile
markets
that
are
located
outside
the
state.
vermont
is
a
very
small
state,
but
at
the
same
time
we're
surrounded
by
new
hampshire,
massachusetts,
and
new
york,
all
of
which
have
considerably
larger
and
accessible
automobile
markets.
what
the
legislature
intended
to
do
was
simply
to
give
the
vermonter
the
option
of
exploring
automobile
markets
in
other
states.
the
credit
is
available
only
if
the
car
is
purchased
in
a
reciprocal
state.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
your
honor,
i--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--i'd
ask
the
court's...
an
apology--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--right.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
right.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
that's...
yeah.
when
you
read
the
rest
of
the
sentence,
that
is
true;
at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
tax
paid
to
the
other
state,
providing
the
state
is
a
reciprocal
state.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
yes.
new
york
and--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--but,
your
honor,
as
we
argued
to
the
vermont
supreme
court,
section
89--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
a
correct
statement
as
far
as
it
goes.
it
doesn't
except
the
administration,
the
actual
administration
of
the
tax.
the
tax
is
administered
by
the
commissioner
of
motor
vehicles.
and
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
section
8911(9)
talks
about
the
credit
being
available
to
a
resident
and
upon
the
application
for
registration,
which
brings
into
question,
or
brings
into
the
case
the
other
statutes
which
are
in
pari
materia,
the
state's
registration
statutes
and
the
state's
residency
laws.
and
when
the
statutes
are
put
together,
as
the
commissioner
has
interpreted
and
as
it
has
been
argued
to
the
vermont
supreme
court,
the
credit
is
only
available
if
the
resident
first
registers
the
car
in
the
state
of
vermont.
and
i
think
the
logic
is
plain
because
if
the
resident,
if
the
purpose
of
the
credit
provision
is
simply
to
enable
the
vermonter
to
make
a
quick
trip
to
another
state
to
make
a
purchase
and
to
return
to
vermont
to
use
the
car
in
vermont,
as
the
court
pointed
out
before,
it's
unlikely
that
a
resident
of
vermont
is
going
to
make
a
shopping
trip
in
another
state
and
then
actually
register
the
car
in
the
state
in
which
it
is
purchased.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
it
is...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--it
is
administered
by
the
commissioner
of
motor
vehicles.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
there
are
no
formal
regulations,
your
honor.
i
have
discussed
with
the
commissioner
what
are
the
various
scenarios,
and
this
is
the
representation--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--i'm
not
disagreeing
with
you,
your
honor.
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
you.
but
i'm
submitting
that
the
interpretation
that
we
advance--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--that
raises
another
complicated
question,
and
that
is--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--we
waived
it
because
this
case,
williams,
was
based
upon
the
decision
of
the
vermont
supreme
court
in
leverson.
and
in
leverson,
which
is
actually
the
decision
that's
before
the
court,
we
did
submit
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm.
so
when
i
received
the
jurisdictional
statement,
i
did
send
a
letter
to
the
court
indicating
that
we
were
waiving
the
motion
to
dismiss
because,
as
i
said,
the
case
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
leverson
and
we
already
submitted
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
that
case.
the...
under
the
examples
that
i
said
before,
everybody
who
registers
that
car
at
the
same
time
would
be
paying
the
same
amount
of
tax.
the
resident
who
purchased
the
car
in
a
reciprocal
state
and
first
registered
it
in
vermont
would
pay
$110.
it
would
be
kept
by
the
reciprocal
state,
but
that
individual
has
only
acquired
a
singular
privilege
of
driving
in
vermont.
by
not
registering
the
car
in
that
other
state,
he
has
acquired
no
privileges
in
that
state,
except
perhaps
the
temporary
privileges
that
may
attend
the
intransit
registration.
just
about
all
states
provide
that
a
nonresident
can
avoid
paying
the
sales
tax
on
an
automobile
purchase
if
he
or
she
obtains
an
in-transit
registration
rather
than
a
permanent
registration.
and
that's
what
the
legislature
was
envisioning
when
it
enacted
this
credit
provision,
to
simply
enable
the
vermonter
to
make
the
quick
trip,
come
back
to
vermont,
and
register
the
car
in
vermont.
in
the
case
where
the
resident
first
registers
the
vehicle
in
the
other
state
and
then
returns
to
vermont
and
registers
the
car
in
vermont,
he
is
not
extended
a
credit,
and
justifiably.
in
that
situation,
the
individual
has
acquired
the
privilege
of
using
the
vehicle
in
several
states,
in
two
states.
and
it's
only
fair
that
if
he
is
going
to
use...
or
if
he's
obtained
this
privilege,
that
he
should
pay
each
state.
the
court
has
long
recognized
that
the
use
tax
is
a
legitimate
means
of
raising
revenue.
and
the
state
of
vermont
is
certainly
within
its
authority
to
ask
the
appellants
in
this
case,
once
they
become
residents
of
the
state,
to
pay
the
use
tax.
similarly,
the
states
are
within
their
authority
to
impose
a
sales
tax.
i
find
it
ironic
that
mr.
williams
is
complaining
that
the
one-time
fee
imposed
by
the
state
of
vermont
in
the
amount
of
4
percent
of
the
value
of
a
vehicle
as
of
the
time
it
is
registered
in
vermont
is
unfair,
yet
he's
not
complaining
about
the
one-time
fee
that
he
had
to
pay
to
illinois
when
he
purchased
the
car
there.
i
think
really
what
the
situation
presents--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--well,
your
honor,
he
does.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
well,
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
there's
a
reason
why
mr.
williams
should
not
get
the
credit.
if
mr.
williams
gets
the
credit
in
this
case,
it
means
that
mr.
williams
will
have
paid
to
the
state
of
vermont
absolutely
nothing.
he
will
acquire
the
same
privilege
of
using
the
car
in
vermont
that
any
other
individual
would
have
to
pay
for.
and
that--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--because,
for
the
same
reasoning,
the
new
yorker
who
buys
a
car
in
vermont
and
goes
back
to
new
york.
it's
a
reciprocal
arrangement.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
well,
because,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--well,
your
honor,
the
appellant
purchased
his
car,
presumably,
while
he
was
a
resident
of
that
state.
as
a
resident
of
that
state...
and
he
wanted
to
use
his
car
in
his
own
state.
and
he
was
liable
if
he
wanted--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--she
would
if
she
registered
the
vehicle
in
new
york.
if
she
is
a
resident
of...
a
legal
resident
of
vermont
who
accepted
employment
in
new
york
and
because
of
her...
whatever
contacts
in
new
york
and
the
laws
dealing
with
residency
in
new
york
for
motor
vehicle
purposes,
she
is
required
to
register
her
car
there,
and
she
registers
her
car
there.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
appellants'
privileges
and
immunity--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--well,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
--well,
your
honor,
the
facts
of
the
case
were
presented
to
the
vermont
supreme
court
and
the
vermont
supreme
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
discrimination.
the
examples
that
i
have
given
to
this
court
were
the
same
examples
that
i
gave
to
the
vermont
supreme
court.
now,
i'm
really...
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
your
honor.
the
decision
is
not
clear.
mr.
andrew
m.
eschen
but
i
submit
that
the
decision
has
been
made
by
the
court,
and
that
under
vermont
law
the
commissioner's
interpretation
has
been
accepted.
the
privileges
and
immunities
challenge,
i
believe,
is
also
without
merit.
again,
the
tax
was
imposed
only
after
the
appellants
became
residents
of
the
state
of
vermont.
the
interesting
issue
in
this
case
is
simply
the
right
to
register
a
motor
vehicle
or
the
access
to
registering
a
motor
vehicle.
they
are
in
essence
challenging
the
laws
of
their
own
state.
prior
to
becoming
residents,
they
did
not
have
any
obligation
to
pay
the
tax.
the
tax
was
incurred
only
when
they
became
residents.
so
i
would
submit
that
there
is
a
question
of
standing
as
to
whether
they
could
challenge
it
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
but
even
if
they
could,
again
the
interest
in
this
case
is
certainly
not
an
interest
of
the
same
caliber
as
the
court
has
recognized
in
other
privileges
and
immunities
cases...
hicklin...
we're
not
dealing
with
a
right
to
seek
employment;
we're
not
dealing
with
a
fundamental
right
to
vote.
this
is
simply
the
right
to
register
an
automobile.
and
i
think
the
case
of
baldwin
v.
fish
and
game
commission
of
montana
would
be
dispositive
of
that
point.
the
commerce
clause
issue
i
submit
is
also
with
merit.
the
appellants
contend
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
apportionment;
yet,
they
hardly
define
what
they
mean
by
apportionment.
to
the
extent
that
they
disagree
with
a
tax
based
upon
the
value
of
a
vehicle,
the
decision
of
the
court
in
capital
greyhound
lines
v.
brice
is
dispositive
of
that
contention.
to
the
extent
that
they
claim
that
apportionment
is
required
to
reflect
prior
use
in
the
other
state,
i
submit
that
the
vermont
tax
scheme
whereby
the
vehicle
is
taxed
on
the
value
as
of
the
time
it
is
used
in
the
state
of
vermont,
registered
in
the
state
of
vermont,
would
satisfy
the
requirement
of
apportionment.
it
is
a
reasonable
way
of
dealing
with
the
situation
where
a
vehicle
has
been
used
outside
the
state.
i
would
conclude,
your
honors,
by
saying
that
the
statute
is
unclear
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
it
was
submitted
to
the
vermont
supreme
court.
the
vermont
supreme
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
discrimination.
i
have
made
representations
to
the
court
as
to
how
this
statute
and
the
tax
provisions
are
administered.
those
are
based
upon
my
discussions
with
the
commissioner
of
motor
vehicles
and
other
officials
in
the
department.
that
is
their
representation
of
how
it
is
administered.
i
have
no
reason
to
disagree
with
that.
i
can
very
well
appreciate
the
court's
concern
about
the
vermont
supreme
court's
decision
in
not
specifically
addressing
the
scenarios
that
i
have
addressed
to
the
court
today,
but
i
would
nevertheless
submit
that
the
interpretation
that
we
have
advanced
is
an
interpretation
that
would
show
that
there
is
equality
of
treatment
by
the
state
of
vermont.
thank
you.
