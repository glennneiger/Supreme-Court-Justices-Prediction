you
say
the
proper
basis
for
comparison
here
is
not
the
vermont
resident
who
stays
for
two
or
three
weeks
in
new
york
or
illinois,
but
the
one
who
stays
for
the
longer...
three,
three
month
or
longer
period?
justice
rehnquist
how
likely
is
it
that
a
nonresident
would
seek
to
register
a
car
in
new
york...
or
in
vermont?
justice
rehnquist
rather
than
in
their
home
state?
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
isn't
your
case,
though?
justice
rehnquist
i
guess
we
have
no
way
of
finding
out.
i'm
curious
to
know
just
how
many
people
would
actually
be
in
this
situation
of
a
vermont
resident
who
buys
a
car
and
illinois
and
uses
it
for
a
couple
of
months
in
illinois
before
bringing
it
back
to
vermont.
i
suppose
just
in
the
law
of
coincidences
there
may
be
some
people
that
that
happens
to,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
fairly
rare
situation.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
eschen,
you
refer
to
the
tax
as
kind
of
a
fee
for
the
use
of
the
roads.
but
this
is
a
one-time
tax,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
it's
not
like
your
yearly
license
renewal.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
cars
are
not
taxed
as
personal
property?
