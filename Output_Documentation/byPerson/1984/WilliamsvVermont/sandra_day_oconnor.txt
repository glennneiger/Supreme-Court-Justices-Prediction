justice
o'connor
mr.
williams,
i
was
going
to
inquire
whether
it
isn't
the
case
that
illinois
and
new
york
laws
exempt
vermont
residents
from
payment
of
the
sales
tax
if
they
leave
vermont
and
buy
the
vehicle
in
illinois
or
new
york?
justice
o'connor
mr.
williams,
let
me
try
to
clarify
this
thing
in
my
own
mind
a
little
bit
further.
if
a
vermont
resident
obtained...
bought
a
vehicle
out
of
the
state
of
vermont
and
registered
the
vehicle
in
another
state
for
the
vehicle's
first
registration,
is
there
a
credit
then
if
the
vermont
resident
later
brings
the
vehicle
into
vermont
and
registers
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
williams,
doesn't
each
state
in
which
a
vehicle
is
used
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
imposing
taxes
for
the
benefit
of
the
roads
in
the
state
in
which
the
vehicle
is
used?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
williams,
is
it
your
claim
that
the
vehicle
that
you
purchased
when
you
did
not
live
in
vermont
was
never
used
outside
the
state
of
vermont?
justice
o'connor
so
the
vehicle
was
used
elsewhere?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
somehow
it's
wrong
that
each
state
can
charge
taxes
for
the
use
of
the
vehicle
while
in
that
state?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
your
incentive
would
perhaps
still
be
to
buy
the
car
in
illinois
because
the
vermont
tax
is
based
on
the
used
value
rather
than
the
sales
value.
so
what
the
incentive
is
for
your
commerce
clause
analysis,
it
seems
to
me,
is
just
to
delay
the
purchase
a
little
bit
until
you've
made
the
move,
but
it
wouldn't
influence
where
you
made
the
purchase,
i
think,
except
perhaps
to
maybe
slightly
prefer
to
buy
it
out
of
state.
justice
o'connor
well,
as
long
as
there's
a
reciprocal
arrangement,
then
for
your
commerce
clause
analysis
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
incentive
is
just
to
delay
the
purchase
until
you've
made
your
move.
justice
o'connor
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
where
you
make
your
purchase
as
long
as
there's
this
reciprocal
arrangement.
justice
o'connor
but
mr.
eschen,
the
complaint,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
nonresident
of
vermont
is
paying
two
taxes.
it
isn't
the
discrimination
on
the
tax
in
vermont;
it's
the
fact
that
the
other
state,
illinois
or
new
york
or
whatever
it
is,
also
extracted
a
tax
and
they're
complaining
about
the
second
tax.
and
when
i
asked
mr.
williams
the
same
question
that
justice
stevens
asked
you
about
the
resident
of
vermont
who
first
registers
a
car
out
of
state,
he
gave
the
opposite
answer--
justice
o'connor
--and
disagrees
with
you.
justice
o'connor
now,
how
are
we
supposed
to
resolve
that?
what...
do
you
have
some
definitive
holding
in
the
state
of
vermont
that
back
up
your
claim
as
to
what
the
law
is?
how
do
we
know?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
eschen,
i
asked
you
some
time
ago
what
we
could
look
to
know
if
you're
correct
on
your
interpretation.
you
didn't
answer
the
question.
is
there
another
vermont
supreme
court
decision
to
cite
to
us?
justice
o'connor
it's
just
your
version
against
mr.
williams'
version.
