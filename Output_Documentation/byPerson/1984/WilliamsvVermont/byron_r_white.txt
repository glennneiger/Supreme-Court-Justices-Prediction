justice
white
actually,
the
discrimination
you
complain
of
occurs
after
you're
a
resident
of
vermont.
and
so
it's
really
a
discrimination
between
two
residents
of
vermont.
justice
white
well,
that's
your
basis
for
your
equal
protection
argument.
justice
white
but
there's
no
rational
basis
for
differentiating
between
these
two
kinds
of
residents.
justice
white
of
course,
even
if
you
win,
you
may
not
win.
i
mean
the
remedy
for
the
equal
protection
violation
might
be
to
go
back
and
charge
all
vermonters.
justice
white
apparently
the
legislature
thought
it
happened
often
enough
to
provide
for
the
exemption.
justice
white
for
the
deduction.
justice
white
what's
this
case...
this
case
is
a
non-case
in
your
view
then.
is
that
it?
justice
white
now,
finish
your
sentence.
she
was
a
resident
of
vermont
in
justice
stevens'
example.
she
went
to
new
york,
bought
a
car,
worked
there
for
a
year,
came
back,
used
the
car,
and
then
registered
it
in
vermont.
now,
when
does
the
credit
ever
apply
if
it
doesn't
apply
then?
justice
white
when
it
first
registers?
you
mean
it
doesn't
register
it
in
the--
justice
white
--the
person
had
to
pay
a
tax
in
the
reciprocal
state,
but...
right?
otherwise,
there
wouldn't
be
any
occasion
for
a
credit.
justice
white
is
this
construction
that
you
suggested
here
of
your
exemption
provision,
is
that
plain
enough
from
the
opinion
below?
justice
white
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
it
sounds
to
me
like
the
case
is
as
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
describes
it.
that's
the
way...
at
least
that's
what
the
lower
court,
the
court
below
upheld.
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
in
these
same
terms?
justice
white
well,
there's
no
argument
from
the
other
side
that
there
shouldn't
be
a...
that
people
who
use
the
roads
shouldn't
pay.
it's
the
discrimination,
the
claimed
discrimination.
let
me
ask
you
while
i've
interrupted
you,
suppose
the
tax
operated
in
the
way
that
you
would
think
it
operated
from
reading
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
or,
even
more
specifically,
the
way
it
operated,
the
way
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
states
the
case.
what
if
he
were
right
in
answering
justice
o'connor's
question
the
way
he
did?
and
in
justice
stevens'
example,
the
lady,
the
vermont
resident,
who
goes
to
new
york,
works
for
a
year,
buys
a
car
and
comes
back
to
vermont...
suppose
that
she
would
get
the
credit,
but
that
a
new
york
resident
who
moved
up
there
the
same
day
would
or
wouldn't.
now,
suppose
that
were
the
way
the
law
operated.
what
do
you
think?
would
you
be
in
constitutional
trouble?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
yes,
but
a
newly
arrived
resident
who
wasn't
a
resident
when
he
bought
his
car
doesn't
get
the
credit
under
his
version.
justice
white
does
the...
who
enforces
this
tax?
justice
white
and
are
there
regulations
issued
with
respect
to
this?
justice
white
well,
you'd
never
gather
your...
i'll
say
again,
you
would
never
gather
your
interpretation
from
what
you
can
read
in
the--
justice
white
--you
didn't
file
a
response
to
the...
you
didn't
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
to
the
jurisdictional
state,
did
you?
justice
white
you
waived
it.
justice
white
anybody
who
is...
any
vermont
resident
who
is
entitled
to
the
credit,
whatever
that
condition
might
be,
doesn't
pay
for
the
use
of
the
vermont
roads.
justice
white
well,
you
mean
because
he's
paid
it
to
the
other
state
and
the
state
is
a
reciprocal
state?
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't
help
him
much.
i
mean
it
helps
him
a
lot,
i
guess,
but
it
doesn't
help
people
who
don't
get
the
credit.
justice
white
well,
you're
saying
because
of
reciprocity,
the
vermont
resident
who
gets
the
credit
is
really
paying
for
the
use
of
the
roads,
of
the
vermont
roads,
because
he
paid
some
money
to
new
york.
justice
white
i
don't
follow
that.
