justice
o'connor
let
me
pursue
this
just
a
little
further,
because
i'm
confused
by
your
answers
to
justice
stevens.
can
we
not
approach
this
case
under
the
assumption
that
the
term
is
merely
descriptive,
but
nonetheless
determine
what
the
effect
is
then
of
the
statutory
scheme
under
these
circumstances?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
popkin,
i
suppose
the
respondent
has
raised
certain
defenses
and
argues
that
the
trial
court
ruling
on
the
local
use
exception
defense,
for
example,
was
erroneous.
so
even
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
points
you
made
this
morning,
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
for
review
by
ca-9
on
this
issues?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
just
didn't
address
it,
did
it?
justice
o'connor
so
i
suppose
it
would
be
open
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
at
least
review
that
finding
on
the
remand,
would
it
not?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
but
subsection
(f)
says
that
if
it
has
become
distinctive
of
the
applicant's
goods
in
commerce
it
can
be.
justice
o'connor
and
that
was
the
determination
of
the
patent
office.
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
the
patent
office
found
a
secondary
meaning
or
the
distinctive
description
application
to
have
issued
the
mark
in
the
first
place?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
seems
to
me
we
do,
because
under
your
view
they
would
have
had
no
right
to
issue
the
trademark
otherwise.
justice
o'connor
and
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
the
trial
court
felt
the
same
way?
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
ca-10
and
ca-2,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
tenth
and
second
circuits,
say
that
an
incontestable
mark
is
conclusively
presumed
to
be...
to
have
secondary
meaning.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
also
tracks
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
o'connor
but
it
would
be
your
position
that
the
patent
office
could
never
issue
the
mark
in
the
first
place
if
it
didn't
have
secondary
meaning?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
it
did
issue
it
and
it
wasn't
contested
within
the
five
years,
and
there
we
are.
so
we
have
to
assume,
do
we
not,
that
it
has
secondary
meaning?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
he
changed
his
mind,
you
see,
and
there
had
to
be
a
reason,
unless
he
does
it
by
just
throwing
the
papers
up
in
the
air
and
seeing
which
one
lands.
he
had
a
reason
for
changing
his
mind,
and
the
only
reason
legally
that
would
have
permitted
him
to
would
be
to
conclude
that
it
had
a
secondary
meaning,
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
other
legal
ground
would
he
have
had
to
issue
the
trademark?
justice
o'connor
mr.
mccormack,
the
defensive/offensive
distinction
is
really
something
developed
by
the
judiciary.
what
is
there
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
lanham
act
that
would
indicate
support
for
that
judicial
gloss
on
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
so
what
is
it
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
lanham
act
that
lends
any
support?
justice
o'connor
well,
can
you
point
to
anything
other
than
the
text
of
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
inquiry
was
not
as
to
merely
descriptive,
but
whether
there
is
a
defensive/offensive
distinction
in
the
enforcement
aspect.
justice
o'connor
regardless
of
what
the
congress
might
have
intended
when
the
language
was
drafted?
justice
o'connor
is
that
primarily
for
policy
reasons
of
trying
to
discourage
taking
out
of
commonly
used
words
from
our--
justice
o'connor
--useable
language?
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
the
kind
of
a
policy
issue
that
congress
really
should
address,
rather
than
the
court?
