mr.
alan
e.
popkin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
case
of
statutory
interpretation.
the
statutes
involved
are
sections
1064,
1065,
and
1115(b)
of
title
15
of
the
united
states
code,
the
so-called
incontestability
provisions
of
the
lanham
act.
the
sole
question
before
this
honorable
court
is
whether
this
statute,
whose
constitutionality
is
unchallenged
and
the
literal
meaning
of
which
has
been
conceded
and
which
is
clear,
should
be
interpreted
in
a
way
other
than
as
congress
uttered
it.
the
factual
background
of
this
case
is
that
park
'n
fly,
the
petitioner,
was
organized
in
1967
and
started
its
operations
in
st.
louis,
missouri.
the
business
of
park
'n
fly
was
the
so-called
offsite
airport
parking,
and
that
business
consists,
if
your
honor
please,
of
the
acquisition
of
and
building
of
a
parking
facility
in
areas
proximate
to
airports.
at
those
locations,
customers
or
patrons
come
to
park
their
cars,
and
then
there
is
a
shuttle
or
bus
service
that
park
'n
fly
provides,
or
that
such
offsite
airport
parking
facilities
provide,
that
moves
the
customer
from
that
offsite
facility
to
the
airport,
takes
him
right
from
his
automobile
to
the
gate
area
or
to
the
area
where
his
baggage
will
be
off-loaded.
and
then
upon
his
return
from
his
trip,
buses
are
circulated
at
three
to
five
minutes
and
those
buses
pick
the
patrons
up,
again
very
close
to
where
they
disembark,
return
them
to
the
parking
lot
and
return
them
right
to
their
vehicles,
from
whence
they
then
depart.
park
'n
fly,
as
i
say,
started
in
1967
in
st.
louis,
and
they
have
expanded
now
so
that
they
are
in
cleveland,
boston,
new
orleans,
houston,
montreal,
memphis,
san
francisco
and
atlanta.
their
operation
has
truly
become
national
in
scope.
the
history
of
the
trademark
that
park
'n
fly
obtained
was
that
in
1969
park'n
fly,
shortly
after
it
opened
its
second
facility
in
cleveland,
decided
to
apply
for
registration
under
the
lanham
act,
and
they
filed
for
registration
originally
in
august
of
1969.
initially
the
registration
that
they
sought
for
their
mark,
park
'n
fly,
was
denied
by
the
examiner
at
the
patent
and
trademark
office.
it
was
denied
because
he
found
that
the
mark
was
merely
descriptive
of
the
service
that
park
'n
fly
was
rendering.
park
'n
fly
applied
for
re-examination
of
that
mark,
applied
to
that
examiner
within
six
months,
as
it
had
a
right
to
do,
and
supplemented
its
presentation
with
a
brief
setting
forth
in
detail
why
it
felt
that
indeed
this
was
not
a
merely
descriptive
mark.
upon
reexamination,
the
patent
examiner,
trademark
examiner,
found
that
the
mark
was
not
merely
descriptive
and
so
it
was
admitted
to
registration
in
august,
august
31st
of
1971,
approximately
two
years
after
the
date
on
which
park
'n
fly
had
initially
sought
registration.
in
may
of
1977,
park
'n
fly
filed
an
affidavit
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
1065,
an
affidavit
of
incontestability,
setting
forth
therein
the
statutory
requirements,
namely,
that
the
mark
park
'n
fly
as
registered
had
been
in
constant
use
for
five
years,
at
least
five
years,
and
that
there
was
no
successful
challenge
against
its
validity
at
that
point
in
time.
well,
at
that
moment
in
may
of
'77
the
certificate,
if
you
will,
of
incontestability
was
issued
and
the
mark
became
incontestable
within
the
meaning
of
sections
1065
and
1115(b)
of
title
15.
during
the
year
1977,
defendant
dollar
park
and
fly
was
engaged
in
the
identical
business
in
the
portland,
oregon
area.
in
early
1977,
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
here,
park
'n
fly,
became
aware
of
the
existence
of
dollar
park
and
fly
in
portland,
oregon,
and
attempted,
unsuccessfully,
to
extrajudicially
discourage
them
from
their
continued
use
of
the
name
park
'n
fly.
when
those
efforts,
which
were
mainly
letters,
proved
unsuccessful,
suit
was
filed
in
the
district
court
for
oregon
in
june
of
1978,
and
the
trial
judge,
judge
frye,
found
for
the
petitioner
and
issued
an
injunction
restraining
and
enjoining
the
respondent
from
using
the
name
park
and
fly
because
park
and
fly
was
confusingly
similar
with
park
'n
fly.
the
petitioner
spelled
its
name
with
an
apostrophe
n,
instead
of
spelling
out
"and",
and
the
respondent
spelled
out
"and".
on
appeal,
this
case
went
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
that
court,
speaking
through
judge
kennedy,
reversed
on
october
13th,
1983,
and
in
reversing
held
that
incontestability
was
not
available
in
a
proceeding
for
injunction
or
for
enforcement
of
a
trademark,
but
that
incontestability
applied
only
in
a
defensive
posture,
that
is,
when
somebody
was
attempting
to
cancel
a
mark.
and
so
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held,
the
gist
of
their
holding
was,
that
the
mark
park
'n
fly
cannot
be
cancelled
because
of
the
incontestability
provision,
but
cannot
be
enforced,
because
the
ninth
circuit
found
on
its
own,
without
the
benefit
of
holdings
from
the
court
below,
that
the
mark
was
merely
descriptive.
and
so
that--
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
exactly
so.
they
cannot
have
their
mark
cancelled,
but
on
the
other
hand
they
are
not
entitled
to
stop
anybody
from
using
it.
so
that
the
gist
of
the
holding
was:
you
are
free,
park
'n
fly,
petitioner,
to
use
that
mark,
but
so
is
the
rest
of
the
world
because
you
cannot
stop
them
from
using
it.
the
sole
question,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
involves
the
interpretation
of
the
incontestability
provision
of
the
lanham
act,
specifically
of
1115(b)
of
title
15.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
significantly
different,
because--
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
--no,
i
don't
think
we
can
assume
that
the
mark
is
descriptive,
your
honor.
there's
only
been
one
judicial
holding
or
one
holding
as
to
whether
or
not
this
mark
is
descriptive,
other
than
what
the
ninth
circuit
did,
and
that
was
what
the
patent
examiner
did,
the
patent
and
trademark
examiner.
and
he
found
that
the
mark
was
not
descriptive.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
i'm
saying
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
mark
is
descriptive
is
ruled
out
by
the
incontestability
provision.
that
is
not
one
of
the
seven
defenses.
if
it
were
one
of
the
seven
defenses,
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
would
be
still
wrong
because
there
has
been
no...
nothing...
no
clearly
erroneous
finding.
it
should
have
remanded
to
the
district
court.
but
it
is
not
one
of
the
seven
defenses
that
congress
permits
under
the
provisions
of
the
lanham
act.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
that
would
be
so,
yes,
your
honor.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute--
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
--yes,
your
honor,
you
may
approach
it
in
that
way.
we
would
not
concede
that
the
mark
is
merely
descriptive,
but
our
position
is
that
it
doesn't
matter,
because
our
position
is
that
under
the
clear
language
of
1115(b)
mere
descriptiveness
is
not
a
defense
to
incontestability.
and
in
looking
at
the
statutory
language
there
are,
of
course,
many
aids
and
guides
that
a
court
can
have
in
unraveling
arcane
or
ambiguous
statutes.
but
there's
a
threshold
question
and
that
threshold
question
is
is
the
statute
ambiguous,
is
it
difficult
to
understand.
and
if
it
isn't
then,
as
this
court
observed
in
the
escondido
case
decided
last
term,
statutory
language
must
ordinarily
be
regarded
as
conclusive.
let's
look
at
this
language.
the
language
states
that:
"the
registration
shall
be
conclusive
evidence
of
the
registrant's
exclusive
right
to
use
the
registered
mark,
except
when.
"
--and
then
they
list
seven
defenses,
congress
did,
except
when
one
of
those
defenses
or
defects
is
appropriate.
the
first
phrase
is
"shall
be
conclusive
evidence".
it's
hard
to
imagine,
at
least
for
a
person
who
is
used
to
trying
lawsuits,
anything
clearer
than
something
that
says
"conclusive
evidence",
because
that
means
to
us
that
it
is,
the
issue
is
concluded.
there
is
no
rebuttal
available.
when
the
evidence
becomes
conclusive,
that
means
that
the
issue
is
settled.
it
is
interesting
to
speculate
also
on
what
congress
did
not
say.
they
didn't
say
that
this
was
conclusive
evidence
only
in
a
cancellation
proceeding,
or
exclusive
or
conclusive
evidence
only
when
a
defensive
use
was
being
made.
they
said
that
this
was
conclusive
evidence,
without
limitation
on
the
type
of
proceeding.
they
also
didn't
say
that
it
was
prima
facie
evidence
or
admissible
in
evidence,
which
they
said
in
the
immediately
preceding
section.
1115(a)
of
title
15
deals
with
the
effect
of
registration
under
former
trademark
acts,
and
there
congress
said
that
this
shall
be
admissible
in
evidence
and
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence.
but
when
they
came
to
the
effect
of
incontestability
under
the
lanham
act,
congress
said
it
shall
be
conclusive
evidence.
the
next
phrase,
"exclusive
right
to
use
the
registered
mark.
"
again,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
something
that
could
be
clearer.
"exclusive
right"
means
the
right
to
use
the
mark
to
the
exclusion
of
the
world.
what
else
can
it
mean?
it
is
the
right
that
the
petitioner,
that
the
registrant,
has
to
use
the
mark
exclusively.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
i
say
two
things
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
that
is
what...
congress
intended
the
procedure
that
they
put
forth.
in
order
for
my
opponent's
position
to
make
sense,
we
have
to
presume
that
an
administrative
agency,
the
patent
and
trademark
office,
will
not
do
its
job
properly.
then
the
mark,
after
it
has
been
passed
upon
and
some
mistake
made
by
the
patent
and
trademark
office,
presumably,
is
published
in
the
trademark
gazette
for
30
days
so
that
the
world
has
an
opportunity
to
see
it;
and
then
five
years
of
constant
use,
during
which
time
anybody
may
step
forward
and
say,
i
wish
to
challenge
that
mark,
on
any
ground
without
limitation.
so
that
the
opportunities
for
review
are
just
extensive
for
five
years,
the
period
of
limitations,
if
you
will.
and
what
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
balanced
the
needs.
yes,
it
is
conceivable
that
the
patent
and
trademark
office
will
make
a
mistake.
yes,
it
is
conceivable
that
somebody
situated
in
portland,
oregon,
or
in
poise,
idaho,
or
somewhere
else
will
not
come
in
contact
with
that
mark
during
that
five
years
of
constant
use,
so
that
they
won't
raise
the
question.
but
congress
in
its
wisdom
said,
this
is
a
scheme
that
we
believe
is
appropriate,
because
the
fact
that
somebody
doesn't
get
to
challenge
that
mark
during
a
period
of
five
years,
that
doesn't
preclude
them
from
having
the
opportunity
to
compete.
they're
free
to
compete.
just
don't
use
that
name.
park
'n
fly
in
this
case
has
many
competitors
and
they
don't
identify
themselves
as
park
'n
fly.
there
are
a
multitude
of
names
available.
so
that
the
consumer
doesn't
suffer,
and
the
man
who
has
invested
for
five
years
in
developing
his
mark
knows
at
that
period
of
time
that
there
is
some
stability,
that
he
is
not
going
to
be
confronted
eternally
with
the
same
defense.
now,
in
the
final
phrase
of
section
1115(b)
of
the
statute
the
congress
says
"except
when
one
of
the
following
defenses
or
defects
is
established.
"
and
they
list
seven.
of
course,
one
of
those
seven
is
not
the
defense
of
mere
descriptiveness.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes,
your
honor.
it's
precisely
what
congress
said
it
to
be.
it's
an
exhaustive
list
of
the
substantive
trademark
defenses.
1116
of
the
same
act
points
out
that
injunctions
are
issued
according
to
principles
of
equity,
so
equitable
defenses
such
as
laches
or
unclean
hands
are
still
available.
but
the
substantive
trademark
defenses
are
set
forth
in
1115(b),
your
honor.
now,
it's
also
interesting
in
helping
to
interpret
this
act
to
look
at
the
defenses
section.
defenses
four,
five
and
six
of
the
act
set
out,
amongst
other
things,
the
nature
of
the
defenses
that
can
be
urged.
and
in
using
the
language
and
in
looking
at
the
language,
they
talk
about
the
defense
being
available
when
a
mark
is
charged
to
be
an
infringement,
or
when
the
mark
whose
use
by
a
party
is
charged
to
be
an
infringement,
or
that
the
mark
whose
use
is
charged
as
an
infringement.
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
context
that
what
congress
was
anticipating
was
the
use
of
incontestability
in
an
infringement
proceeding,
and
that
has
to
be
an
offensive
use.
the
interpretation
espoused
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
adopted
by
the
respondent
here
must
fail
for
several
reasons,
that
interpretation,
i.e.,
that
there
is
a
dichotomy
between
offensive
and
defensive
use
of
the
mark.
first
of
all,
there
is
nothing
within
the
four
corners
of
the
statute
that
suggests
that
or
even
hints
at
it.
there
is
nothing,
not
a
syllable,
in
the
legislative
history
that
points
to
this
dichotomous
interpretation.
and
third,
if
one
looks
at
section
1064
of
the
act,
1064
concerns
itself
only
with
cancellations.
1064(a)
and
(b)
talk
in
terms
of
cancellation
before
five
years
and
1064(c)
talks
in
terms
of
what
the
grounds
are
for
cancellation
after
five
years...
precisely
the
same
thing
that
1115(b)
deals
with,
the
period
after
five
years.
if
both
of
those
statutes
are
concerned
only
with
cancellation,
they
are
utter
redundancies;
one
is
not
necessary.
and
we
must
presume
that
congress
had
something
in
mind
when
they
enacted
both
of
these
sections.
and
finally,
the
logical
situation.
the
inherent
value
in
a
mark
is
the
ability
that
it
has
to
identify
goods
and
services,
and
if
the
position
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
in
fact
true
then
park
'n
fly
in
each
of
the
cities
in
which
it
chooses
to
operate
may
have
four
or
five
or
any
number
of
competitors
all
of
whom
will
identify
themselves
as
park
'n
fly,
and
there
will
be
nothing
that
park
'n
fly
can
do
to
arrest
that.
that
cannot
conceivably,
i
submit,
be
the
scheme
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
lanham
act
act.
there
is
no
basis,
as
i
say,
in
the
statute
nor
in
the
legislative
history.
the
position
taken
by
the
respondent
is
that
to
interpret
the
statute
as
we
contend
would
frustrate
the
purposes
of
the
lanham
act.
and
we
think
and
we
submit,
as
our
briefs
have
shown,
that
the
contrary
is
true.
the
very
purposes
of
the
lanham
act
will
be
fulfilled,
rather
than
frustrated,
by
applying
the
plain
meaning
of
this
statute
to
its
interpretation.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
genericness
is
one
of
the
seven
defenses
that
congress
has
written,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
i
think
it's
1115(b).
it's
incorporated
under
1164(c).
but
genericness
is
one
of
the
defenses.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
commonly
descriptive,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
i
believe
it's
incorporated
under
the
provisions
of
1064
(c),
which
are
incorporated
into
1115(b).
and
common
descriptiveness
is
genericness,
so
that
if
the
mark
comes
to
mean
the
product
or
the
service
that
is
a
defense
to
incontestability.
and
in
the
instant
case,
there
has
been
a
specific
finding
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
that
there
has
been
no
proof
that
this
mark
has
become
generic.
but
genericness
is
a
defense,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes,
your
honor.
not
only
is
it
available,
it
was
urged.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
the
essence
is--
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
--that
is
part--
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
--it's
quite
clear
that
mere
descriptiveness
is
not
a
grounds
for
a
defense
to
incontestability.
that's
clear.
genericness
is
a
defense
to
incontestability.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
expressly,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
your
honor,
secondary
meaning
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
no,
your
honor,
not
under
the
construction
that
we
contend.
under
the
plain
meaning
of
this
statute,
there
are
seven
defenses
to
incontestability,
the
fact
that
a
mark
has
or
has
not
acquired
secondary
meaning
does
not
out
across
those
seven
defenses.
even
if
the
mark
had
not
acquired
secondary
meaning,
it
is
not
a
defense
to
incontestability
that
it
has
not
acquired
such
a
meaning.
the
issue
of
secondary
meaning
arises
when
you
have
a
merely
descriptive
mark.
a
merely
descriptive
mark
is
susceptible
of
registration
if
that
mark
has
acquired
secondary
meaning.
and
it
raises,
of
course,
a
very
interesting
problem
for
litigants,
because
in
the
trenches
of
litigation
what
happens
is
that,
as
counsel
points
out,
in
many
of
these
cases
there
has
been
evidence
that
marks
alleged
to
have
been
merely
descriptive
have
in
fact
acquired
secondary
meaning.
what
happens
consistently
is
that
counsel,
as
lawyers
are
wont
to
be
sometimes,
they
are
very
cautious,
so
they
will
go
out
and
they
will
conduct
surveys.
each
side
will
have
them.
they'll
conduct
extensive
discovery.
they
will
absorb
huge
slots
of
courts'
times
presenting
evidence
concerning
secondary
meaning,
when
it's
utterly
unnecessary
under
the
literal
meaning
of
1115(b).
and
we
would
urge
and
hope
that,
when
the
court
declares
that
1115(b)
means
what
congress
said
it
means,
that
there
will
be
some
judicial
economy
achieved
in
putting
an
end
to
this
sort
of
useless
proceeding.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
1064(c)
is
incorporated
into
the
body
of
1115(b).
it's
specifically
incorporated.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
it's
part...
it
is
incorporated
into
it.
it
is
in
addition
to
those
defenses.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
it
is
not
an
exhaustive
list
in
the
sense
that
there--
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
--well,
1064(c)
is
duplicative
in
a
number
of
aspects.
for
example,
fraud,
abandonment
are
mentioned
in
1064(c);
fraud
and
abandonment
are
also
defenses
under
1115(b),
so
that
there
is
some
duplication.
but
under
1064(c)
there
is,
"at
any
time
if
the
registered
mark
becomes
the
common
descriptive
name
of
an
article
or
substance.
"
that
is
one
of
the
defenses
that
is
incorporated
under
the
provisions
of
1115(b).
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
there
are
other
defenses
which
have
specifically
been
incorporated.
they
are
there
in
black
and
white.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
they're
not
listed
in
the
body
of
the
section,
but
they
are
specifically
referred
to
by
the
section.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
let's
see
if
i
can
find
it
precisely
for
your
honor.
0....
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes.
and
under
1065
it
says,
"except
on
a
ground
for
which
application
to
cancel
may
be
filed
at
any
time
under
subsections
(c)
and
(e)
of
section
1064
of
this
title.
"
so
that
1065,
which
sets
up
what
incontestability
is,
says
that
the
defenses
of
1064(c)
and
(e)
will
be
incorporated
into
1115(b).
that's
where
it
appears,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
there
is
a...
i
wanted
to
speak
briefly
about
the
way
in
which
this
offensive-defensive
dichotomy
arose,
and
it
has
a
long
history
that
goes
back
to
1955,
when
the
patent
and
trademark
office
issued
their
rand
mcnally
decision,
and
in
1961
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
decided
the
john
morrell
case,
which
adopted
an
offensive-defensive
dichotomy,
really
on
very
little
basis.
and
there
were
several
courts,
including
the
ninth
circuit,
that
adopted
that
offensive-defensive
dichotomy
without
much
thought
to
it,
until
1976
when
the
union
carbide
case
was
decided
by
judge
pell
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
judge
pell
there
overruled
the
morrell
decision,
and
since
1976
every
circuit
that
has
had
an
opportunity...
and
there
are
four
or
five
of
them
now...
to
review
this
question
has
adopted
the
position
taken
by
judge
pell
in
union
carbide.
and
there
is
one
other
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
before
i
sit
down,
and
that
is
that
one
of
the...
it's
rather
revealing
in
one
of
the
footnotes
that
respondent
has
in
its
brief
that
one
of
the
exceptions,
they
say,
that
should
be
included,
as
they
say
in
footnote
39
on
page
36,
one
of
the
exceptions
that
should
be
included
is
of
marks
that
are
incapable
of
identifying
and
distinguishing
goods
and
services.
i
submit
that
this
court
is
not
concerned
with
what
should
be
an
exception,
but
it
is
concerned
with
what
is
an
exception
and
what
congress
has
said
shall
be
the
exceptions.
and
as
this
court
observed
in
tva
versus
hill:
"our
individual
appraisal
of
the
wisdom
or
unwisdom
of
a
particular
course
consciously
selected
by
the
congress
is
to
be
put
aside
in
the
process
of
interpreting
a
statute.
"
and
i
submit
that
that's
what
should
be
done
here.
this
statute
should
be
enforced
as
it
is
written,
interpreted
as
it
is
written,
and
some
respite
put
to
the
unnecessary
travails
in
the
court
below.
this
case
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
with
instructions
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
no,
your
honor.
judge
frye
in
the
district
court
found
that
the
1115(b)(4)
exception
was
not
applicable
for
two
reasons:
there
was
no
privity;
and,
in
addition
to
being
no
privity,
she
did
not
reach
the
further
point
that
this
is
not
a
local
use.
the
prior
use
was
in
seattle
and
this
use
is
in
portland,
oregon.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
upset
that
finding.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
it
did
not.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
i
think
it
would
be
open
to
review
that
to
find
if
the
judge
was
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
whatever
time
remaining
i
have,
i
would
like
to
have
for
rebuttal,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
counsel
said
that
during
that
five-year
period,
when
mr.
justice
marshall
was
questioning
him,
that
they
couldn't
have
done
anything
because
the
suit
was
brought
later.
but
any
time
up
until
that
five
years
ran
they
could
have
themselves
brought
a
cancellation
proceeding
to
have
this
mark
cancelled,
and
any
defense
would
have
applied.
moreover,
when
they
talk
about
the
fundamental
defense
of
non-likelihood
of
confusion,
non-likelihood
of
confusion
goes
to
infringement,
not
to
validity
of
the
mark.
and
what
1115(b)
addresses
itself
to
is
whether
the
defenses
are
available
in
an
incontestability
proceeding
as
to
the
mark's
validity.
of
course
non-likelihood
of
confusion
is
available,
because
that's...
if
park'n
fly
decided
to
sue
somebody
who
was
calling
himself
joe's
parking
service,
they
could
not
prevail,
because
the
test
would
again
be
was
there
any
likelihood
of
confusion.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
in
a
trademark
infringement
action,
your
honor,
there
are
two
issues
involved.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
mark
is
valid.
it's
much
like
a
title
suit,
a
suit
on
a
piece
of
property.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
mark
has
been
infringed,
and
1115(b)
and
all
of
the
incontestability
provisions
speak
to
that
first
portion:
is
the
mark
valid?
if
it's
valid,
then
it's
susceptible
of
being
enforced.
but
the
provisions
and
the
exceptions
speak
to
that.
with
regard
to
justice
o'connor's
question
as
to
what
happened
in
the
patent
office,
on
page
57
of
the
joint
appendix
there
is
the
ruling
of
the
patent
office,
and
it
says:
"the
mark
of
the
application
above
identified
appears
to
be
entitled
to
registration.
"
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
what
do
i
think
of
it?
i
think
that's
a
question
of
fact
for
the
court
below
to
decide,
whether
or
not
that's
confusingly
similar
with
"park
'n
fly".
that's
something
he
can
take
evidence
on
and
make
a
decision
with
respect
to.
that's
a
question
of
fact
of
whether
it's
confusingly
similar.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
an
enviable
position,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
i
would
find
that
confusingly
similar.
i
think
it
would
be.
i
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
with
it.
but
i
would
be
glad
to
hear
evidence
on
both
sides,
and
perhaps
we
would
have
consumer
surveys
and
the
like.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
in
my
opinion
that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
can't--
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
--i
can't
be
positive.
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
no,
sir.
and
if
you
want
my
opinion--
mr.
alan
e.
popkin
--it's
because
he
found
that
it
was
not
descriptive.
and
that
may
mean
not
that
it
was
just
suggestive,
but
the
brief
suggested
that
it
was
arbitrary
or
fanciful,
because
park
'n
fly
not
only
implied
taking
a
plane,
it
implied
parking
and
getting
away
with
great
haste
so
that
you
could
meet
your
plane.
thank
you.
