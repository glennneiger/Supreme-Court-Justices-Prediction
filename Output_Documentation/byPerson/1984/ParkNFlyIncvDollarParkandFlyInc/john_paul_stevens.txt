justice
stevens
you
made
a
point
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
the
finding
more
or
less
on
its
own.
justice
stevens
would
it
be
a
different
case
if
the
district
court
had
made
a
finding
and
you
agreed
that
the
finding
was
correct?
justice
stevens
can
we
assume
for
purposes
of
decision
that
the
mark
will
be
treated
as
though
it
is
descriptive,
as
they
say?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand.
then
i'm
puzzled.
you're
saying
the
issue
of
whether
it's
descriptive
simply
isn't
open,
is
that
it?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand.
but
i
guess
what
i'm
asking
is,
if
a
court
after
hearing
evidence
thought
it
was
merely
descriptive,
it
just
isn't
permitted
to
think
that,
is
about
what
it
amounts
to?
i
mean,
it
really
would
be
legally
irrelevant?
justice
stevens
is
it
your
position,
mr.
popkin,
that
those
are
the
only
defenses
that
are
ever
available?
justice
stevens
that's
an
exhaustive
list?
justice
stevens
mr.
popkin,
can
you
help
me
again?
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
seven
paragraphs
were
the
exhaustive
list
of
defenses.
justice
stevens
and
i
also
understood
you
to
say,
in
response
to
justice
white,
that
the
defense
of
genericness
is
available,
but
you
didn't
tell
us
which
of
the
seven
paragraphs
it's
in.
justice
stevens
but
then
that's
something
in
addition
to
the
seven
defenses.
justice
stevens
so
then
the
seven
defenses
is
not
an
exhaustive
list?
justice
stevens
are
there
others
beside
genericness
in
addition
to
the
seven,
other
defenses?
justice
stevens
but
it's
not
listed
in
the
seven.
so
the
seven
is
really
not...
this
is
the
heart
of
the
case,
because
really
one
of
your
main
arguments
is
that
the
language
is
perfectly
clear
on
its
face,
there's
seven
defenses,
this
is
not
one
of
them,
therefore
we
win.
but
now
you're
telling
us
there
are
other
defenses.
justice
stevens
but
not
in
1115.
justice
stevens
where
does
the
incorporation
take
place?
where
is
the
express?
is
that
in--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
proceedings
in
the
patent
and
trademark
office
in
response
to
what
justice
o'connor
was
concerned
about.
as
i
understand...
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
on
the
record...
the
issue
before
the
examiner
was
whether
or
not
the
mark
was
descriptive.
there
was
no
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
secondary
meaning;
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
so
there
isn't
any
finding
one
way
or
another
on
the
question
of
secondary
meaning?
justice
stevens
the
initial
rejection
was
because
it
was
not
descriptive...
i
mean,
because
it
was
descriptive,
and
then
the
examiner
changed
his
mind.
justice
stevens
mr.
mccormack,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
on
your
theory.
assume
we
agreed
with
your
view
of
the
law.
would
you
lose
if
they
had
proved
secondary
meaning?
justice
stevens
and
supposing
they
prove
secondary
meaning
in
the
areas
in
which
they
operate,
but
not
in
the
area
in
which
your
client
operates.
would
you
still
lose?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
they
not
only
must
prove
secondary
meaning
in
your
view,
but
also
secondary
meaning
in
every
market
in
which
they
seek
to
enforce
the
mark?
justice
stevens
well,
at
least
to
talk
about
the
validity
of
the
mark
and
the
enforceability.
justice
stevens
if
it
had
secondary
meaning
in
any
market?
justice
stevens
if
it
had
secondary
meaning
in
any
market?
justice
stevens
let
me
put
it
a
little
differently.
supposing
before
the
patent
examiner,
instead
of
fighting
about
whether
it
was
descriptive,
they
say:
we
agree
it's
descriptive,
but
we
can
prove
it
has
secondary
meaning
in
atlanta.
and
they
just
prove
it
had
secondary
meaning
in
atlanta
and
then
went
ahead
and
registered
and
filed
an
affidavit
later.
would
you
lose?
justice
stevens
well,
of
course,
that's
a
different
theory
than
the
ninth
circuit's
theory,
though.
that's
a
different
theory
than
the
ninth
circuit's
theory?
justice
stevens
mr.
popkin,
can
i
ask
you--
0
[briefinterruption.]
justice
stevens
you
can't
be
positive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
was
no
effort
in
the
patent
office
to
try
and
establish
secondary
meaning?
justice
stevens
it's
not
descriptive.
