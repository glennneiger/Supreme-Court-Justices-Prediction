mr.
popkin,
i
just
wanted
to
complete
one
thought
because
it
was
lost
in
the
dialogue.
you
quoted
the
ruling
of
the
examiner
that
the
mark
is
entitled
to
registration.
is
it
not
perfectly
clear
from
the
affidavit
that
was
filed
on
behalf
of
your
client
that
the
reason
it
was
entitled
to
application
was
that
he
presumably
accepted
the
argument
that
it
was
not
a
descriptive
mark?
