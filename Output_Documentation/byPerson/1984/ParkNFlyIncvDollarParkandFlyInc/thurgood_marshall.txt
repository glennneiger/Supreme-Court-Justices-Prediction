justice
marshall
counsel,
tell
me
the
difference
between
a
trademark
being
cancelled
and
this
court
saying
it
can't
be
enforced?
justice
marshall
i'm
listening.
justice
marshall
but
there's
nothing
to
stop
anybody
under
the
sun
from
using
it?
justice
marshall
well,
why
do
you
register
a
trademark?
don't
you
register
it
to
stop
other
people
from
using
it?
justice
marshall
but
now
anybody
can
use
this
trademark.
justice
marshall
but
your
client
can?
justice
marshall
and
any
other
client
you
get
can.
justice
marshall
mr.
mccormack,
if
that
had
been
raised
it
would
have
been
cancelled,
wouldn't
it,
under
your
argument?
justice
marshall
well,
after
it
was
registered
how
could
it
be
cancelled?
justice
marshall
you
could
have?
justice
marshall
but
you
didn't.
justice
marshall
and
so
since
you
couldn't
take
an
action
to
cancel
it,
you
took
this
action.
justice
marshall
you
couldn't
have
filed
an
action
to
cancel?
justice
marshall
so
you
filed
this
one
in
lieu
thereof.
