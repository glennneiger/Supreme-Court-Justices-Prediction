mr.
john
m.
mccormack
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
should
prevail
here
because
of
three
very
fundamental,
very
basic
reasons.
the
first
is,
park
'n
fly
was
improperly
registered.
it
should
never
have
been
registered
in
the
first
place.
it
was
defective
ab
initio.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
under
section
1052(e),
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes.
section
1052(e),
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes.
section
1052(e)
of
the
lanham
act
specifically
proscribes
registration
of
merely
descriptive
marks
or
terms,
and
unless--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not
the
determination.
the
patent
office,
the
examiner
never
received
any
evidence
as
to
distinctiveness
at
all.
the
examiner
in
the
patent
office...
this
is
an
ex
parte
proceeding.
the
examiner
in
the
patent
office
initially
rejected
this
application
for
park
'n
fly.
it's
"park
'n
fly"
plus
a
logo
of
an
airplane
over
a
runway.
the
examiner
said
the
mark
is
rejected
because
the
words
"park
'n
fly"
merely
describe
the
services
that
were
rendered.
and
then
the
petitioner
filed
a
response
to
that
and
the
response
was
just
merely
a
legal
argument
setting
forth
various
cases.
there
was
no
evidence
of
distinctiveness
that
was
submitted
at
all.
the
record
is
absolutely
empty
as
to
distinctiveness
not
only
before
the
patent
and
trademark
office
and
the
examiner,
but
also
at
the
trial
court
level.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
distinctiveness.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
trademark
examiner,
especially
in
a
case
like
this
where
it
did
not
go
to
an
appeal
to
the
trademark
trial
and
appeal
board,
it's
just
the
examiner's
decision.
i
believe
those
decisions
are
always
reviewable.
what
petitioner
wants
to
have
this
court
do
here
is
shackle
courts
from
reviewing
what
the
examiner
decides.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
what
petitioner
is
saying.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
that's
right.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
i'll
try
to
explain,
your
honor.
under
section
1064
it
says
that
a
mark
cannot
be
cancelled
after
five
years,
unless
there
are
certain
specific
grounds.
and
mere
descriptiveness
is
not
one
of
those
grounds.
now,
this
may
sound
inconsistent
to
you,
but
keeping
in
mind
the
congressional
scheme
it
is
not,
because
what
congress
wanted
to
do...
the
1905
act
permitted
marks
to
be
cancelled
at
any
time.
a
party
would
have
a
mark
registered
for
20
years
and
then
a
prior
user
would
come
out
and
cancel
that
mark
after
20
years.
and
congress
saw
this
as
an
evil.
and
this
is
all
pointed
out
in
roberts'
book,
"the
new
trademark
manual",
which
is
very
instructive
on
a
lot
of
these
points.
congress
wanted
to
prevent
the
cancellation
of
marks
after
a
certain
period
of
time.
and
the
reason
that
a
merely
descriptive
mark
should
not
be
cancelled
after
five
years
is
because
possibly
it
can
acquire
secondary
meaning
after
that
five-year
period
or
at
an
time,
and
once
it
acquires
secondary
meaning
then
there
is
an
enforceable
cause
of
action
for
trademark
infringement.
but
we
have
not
reached
that
point
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
mark
is
not
cancelled
there
are
certain
benefits
that
still
attach
to
that
mark
being
on
the
register.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
okay.
the
first
one
is
that
it
will
block
somebody
else
trying
to
register
the
same
or
a
confusingly
similar
mark.
it's
on
the
register,
so
if
somebody
else
wanted
to
seek
to
register
park
'n
fly
that
registration
uncancelled
would
block
that
registration
under
section
1052(d)
of
the
act,
i
believe.
the
other
thing
that
it
would
do
is
it
would
enable
the
registrant
to
acquire
secondary
meaning.
if
secondary
meaning
was
ever
acquired,
then
the
registrant
could
go
into
court,
into
federal
court,
armed
with
the
federal
registration
and
bring
a
lawsuit.
a
third
reason
is,
under
section
1126
of
the
lanham
act...
this
is
a
section
that
refers
to
registering
your
mark
in
foreign
countries.
if
you
have
a
home
registration,
a
u.s.
registration,
you
can
register
your
mark
in
foreign
countries
based
on
that.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
correct.
park
'n
fly
with
their
registration
can
sue
somebody
else
for,
say,
copying
their
trade
dress.
somebody
else
may
use
park
'n
fly
and
stylize
the
letters
or
the
sign
the
same
way.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes,
your
honor,
you
do.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
your
honor,
not
necessarily.
only
a
person--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--yes,
your
honor,
our
client
can,
because
it's--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--no.
other
parties
could
use
the
designation
park
'n
fly.
when
i
said
that
they
could
sue
another
party
for
using
park
'n
fly,
it
would
be
if
that
other
party
copied
the
trade
dress,
in
other
words
the
way
the
signs
were
painted.
perhaps
they
used
park
'n
fly.
they
would
be
free
to
use
park
'n
fly,
but
the
trade
dress,
it's
a
packaging
concept.
if
your
package
looks
like
somebody
else's,
then
you
have
a
cause
of
action.
the
other
thing
is,
we
don't
use
the
logo
that
the
registration
has.
the
park'n
fly
registration
has
a
logo
that's
attached
with
it,
the
logo
of
an
airplane.
so
that's
another
reason
why
the
petitioner's
registration--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--okay.
mere
descriptiveness
is
a
fundamental
defense,
just
like
non-likelihood
of
confusion
is
a
fundamental
defense.
one
can
look
under
section
1115--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--well,
that's
part
of
the
confusion
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
it
is
confusing.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes,
but
cases
have
always
held
that
non-likelihood
of
confusion
can
always
be
offered
as
a
defense,
though
non-likelihood
of
confusion
is
not
listed
under
section
1115(b).
now,
there's
one
other
important
point
here,
and
that
is
that
if
a
mark
is
initially
not
registrable
because
it
violates
section
1052(e)
of
the
act.
section
1052(e)
is
a
substantive
provision
with
respect
to
registration.
now,
mr.
popkin
has
already
conceded
that--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
well,
we're
not
saying
that
the
mark
should
be
cancelled,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
we're
saying
that
it's
not
enforceable,
and
this
is
because
of
traditional
trademark
law
principles.
one
thing
that
we
have
to
keep
clear
is
that
the
right
to
register
is
not
necessarily
the
right
to
use.
now,
according
to
traditional
trademark
law
principles,
going
back
to
the
case
of
canal
v.
clark,
an
1871
case
from
this
court,
merely
descriptive
marks
have
always
been
held
not
to
be
enforceable
unless
they
have
acquired
secondary
meaning.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
not
with
respect
to
this
basic
fundamental
provision,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
representative
lanham
made
a
statement
and
he
said...
he
was
asked,
what
is
the
effect
of
the
seven
defenses
listed
under
section
1115(e)
with
respect
to
the
substantive
law
of
trademarks.
and
representative
lanham's
statement
on
this
point
is
very
instructive.
he
said...
and
i
will
paraphrase.
he
said
that
these
seven
defenses
were
not
intended
to
enlarge,
modify,
restrict
or
amend
the
substantive
law
of
trademarks
as
set
out
in
other
acts,
the
lanham
act,
or
as
interpreted
by
courts.
now,
a
substantive
provision
of
trademark
law
is
that
a
mark
is
not
registrable
under
section
1052(e)
of
the
lanham
act
unless
it's
acquired
secondary
meaning
under
section
1052(f).
that's
a
substantive
principle
that's
over
100
years
old.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
that's
correct.
it
was
an
error
by
the
trademark
offices.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
your
honor,
we
don't.
the
trial
court
could
make
the
same
mistake
that
the
examiner
did.
that
issue--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--that's
correct.
they're
following
the
ever-ready
line
of
cases,
and
we
submit
that
is
in
error.
that's
an
easy
way
out,
but
the
point
of
the
lanham
act
is
to--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--yes,
in
one
particular,
but
not
in
a
fundamental
particular.
and
the
fundamental
particular
is
that
a
merely
descriptive
mark
cannot
be
registered
unless
it
is
shown
to
have
secondary
meaning.
and
that
is
a
question
of
fact,
your
honor,
and
the
burden
is
upon
the
party
seeking
to
assert
the
mark
to
show
that
it's
acquired
secondary
meaning.
now,
for
a
court
to
say,
just
because
it's
been
accorded
incontestable
status,
therefore
it's
conclusively
presumed
that
it
has
secondary
meaning,
is
we
submit
in
gross
error.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
that's
correct,
your
honor;
precisely
the
point.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
your
honor,
we
don't.
a
patent
office
mistake
can
be
reviewed.
now,
we
set
forth
cases
in
our
brief,
the
american
heritage
case
and
the
vision
optics
case.
the
american
heritage
case
talks
about
a
court
going
in
and
reviewing
patent
and
trademark
office
examiner's
mistakes.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
he
gets
a
presumption,
but
that
presumption
can
be
attacked
at
a
later
time.
courts
should
always
have
the
power
to
review
the
examiner's
decision.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
that's
from
court
decisions.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
well,
actually
in
the
lanham
act
itself,
under
section
1116,
it
says
that
the
court
should
have...
excuse
me.
in
1116--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--excuse
me,
1119.
i
misspoke
here,
your
honor.
1119
and
i'll
just
quote
it.
it
says:
"in
any
action
involving
a
registered
mark,
the
court
may
determine
the
right
to
registration
or
to
the
cancel
of
registrations
in
whole
or
in
part,
restore
cancelled
registrations,
and
otherwise
rectify
the
register.
"
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
any
legal
one.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
quite
follow
that.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
that's
correct.
we
cannot
cancel
the
mark
at
this
point,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
that's
precisely--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--that's
correct.
the
examiner
said
it
was
merely
descriptive,
rejected
the
application.
no
showing
of
secondary
meaning
was
ever
offered
to
the
examiner.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
and
then,
as
so
often
happens
in
these
ex
parte
prosecutions,
the
examiner
just
buys
this
legal
argument
and
the
case
goes
to
registration.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
there
was
a
legal
argument.
the
petitioner
filed
a
response
saying
in
essence,
our
mark
is
not
merely
descriptive,
and
then
cited
other--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--presumably
so,
your
honor,
though
it's
hard
to
tell,
because
in
many
of
these
patent
office
cases
before
the
examiners--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--i
don't
think--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--i
don't
think
i'd
say
that.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
i
think
that
the
examiner
made
a
mistake.
the
line
between
suggesting--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--no,
he
felt
that
he--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--he
mistakenly
found--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--he
mistakenly
found
that
the
mark
was
suggestive,
as
opposed
to
merely
descriptive.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
implicitly.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
show.
there's
no
response
from
the
examiner.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
they
did
not
address
the
secondary
meaning
issue.
what
we're
saying
here
is,
the
words
of
the
mark
itself,
"park
'n
fly",
as
used
on
an
offsite
airport
parking
lot
merely
describe
the
functions,
the
characteristics
of
that
lot.
the
examiner
was
correct.
his
initial
reaction
was
precisely
correct
by
saying
that
the
mark
was
merely
descriptive.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
your
honor.
i
respectfully--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--he
would
contend
that
the
mark
was
suggestive.
suggestive
marks
supposedly
are
registrable.
but
this
mark
is
not
suggestive.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
he
must
have,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
if
it
were
true.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
it
would
never
have
been
registered
in
the
first
place,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
somebody
in
a
court
action,
if
they--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--yes.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
well,
that's
because
the
lawsuit
didn't
come
until
after
the
mark
had
become,
according
to--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--well,
we
said
that
the
mark
cannot
be
enforced.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
your
honor,
we
couldn't.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
i
think
the
courts
can
do
that
at
any
time,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
incontestability
means
that
if
a
mark
has
been
accorded
registration
properly,
in
accordance
with
the
substantive
requirements
of
section
1052(e),
for
example,
then
there
are
certain
procedural
advantages
that
will
be
given
to
that
registration.
but
only
then...
if
you
have
a
procedural
advantage
under
incontestability,
we
don't
see
how
that
can
override
a
substantive
failure
under
proper
registration.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
always,
your
honor,
because
it's
a
fundamental
defense.
if
the
mark
should
never
have
been
registered
in
the
first
place
and
if
we
can
show
that,
which
we
have...
the
evidence
is
exhaustive
showing
that
park
'n
fly
is
merely
descriptive,
it's
not
suggestive,
it's
not
arbitrary
or
fanciful.
if
it
does
not
comply
with
the
initial
registration
requirements
of
section
1052,
the
substantive
requirements
of
trademark
law,
then
it
can
never
be
enforced.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
i
think
that
the
way
the
statute...
it's
not
only
my
book,
your
honor.
the
amici
brief
here
says
that
there
are
21
exceptions.
mr.
popkin
says
that
there
are
seven
and
he
concedes,
well,
maybe
1116
allows
him
some
others.
there's
all
kinds
of
exceptions
to
this
particular
statute.
we
feel
that
fundamental
defenses
such
as
non-likelihood
of
confusion,
which
are
not
listed
as
those
seven
defenses,
are
so
key
to
implementation
of
the
lanham
act,
if
non-likelihood
of
confusion
isn't
a
defense,
what
does
a
defendant
against
an
incontestable
registration?
just
sit
there
and
say,
well,
i
lose?
you
know,
obviously
a
defendant
can
plead
non-likelihood
of
confusion.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes,
and
mere
descriptiveness
is
a
traditional
defense,
too.
it's
a
fundamental
defense.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
that
non-likelihood
of
confusion
is
a
very
substantive
provision
of
trademark
law,
and
i'll
attempt
to
explain
why.
marks
can
be
registered
for
one
class
of
goods
or
services.
for
instance,
ford
is
registered
for
automobiles.
now,
if
somebody
else
comes
along
and
they
use
ford
for
say
a
florist
shop...
now,
i'm
not
attempting
to
impugn
ford,
obviously.
i'm
just
using
this
as
an
example.
but
if
ford
attempted
to
sue
the
owner
of
the
florist
shop
for
trademark
infringement,
the
florist
would
say:
there
is
no
likelihood
of
confusion
here
because
we
sell
flowers
under
the
ford
name...
a
very
substantive
defense
going
to
non-related
goods
in
issue.
it's
not
an
equitable
defense
per
se,
like
laches
or
unclean
hands
or
whatever.
so
it
is
a
substantive
defense,
non-likelihood
of
confusion
is,
just
as
if
a
mark
is
not
registrable
in
the
first
place,
substantively
it's
not
registrable
under
section
1052(e),
if
it's
not
registrable
in
the
first
place
then
to
accord
it
protection
under
the
incontestability
provision
seems
to
us
to
completely
frustrate
the
purpose
of
the
lanham
act,
which
is
to
protect
trademarks,
and
trademarks
must
identify
and
distinguish
the
goods
or
services
of
one
manufacturer
from
the
services
of
another.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
the
term
"offensive/defensive
dichotomy"
is
a
shorthand
way
for
the
courts
saying
that
they
do
not
want
to
enforce
a
merely
descriptive...
merely
descriptive
mark.
that
strikes
the
courts
as
being
incorrect.
there's
something
substantively
and
basically
wrong
with
that.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
the
legislative
history
of
the
lanham
act,
it
was
set
up
to
proscribe
registration
of
merely
descriptive
terms
under
section
1052(e).
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
your
honor,
we
did
not
research
that
specific
point.
the
lanham
act
i
believe
would
have
much
trademark
on
saying
that
merely
descriptive
marks
were
not
to
be
accorded
registration,
because
that
follows
with
traditional
trademark
law.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
unaware
of
any
specific
defensive/offensive...
i
think
that's
fashioned
by
courts
to
prevent
unjust
and
inequitable
results.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
i
believe
that
the
courts
have
fashioned
that
shorthand
way
of
interpreting
the
statute
because
they
have
felt
that
they
would
be
interpreting
the
lanham
act
the
way
the
congress
wanted
it
to
be
interpreted.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
i
think
that
congress
has
addressed
that.
i
can't
point
to
a
specific
provision.
but
through
traditional
trademark
law
cases,
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
not
registering
merely
descriptive
marks
is
that
it
would
have
an
anti-competitive
effect,
and
the
trademark
statute
said
that
it
was
set
up
to
provide
protection
to
consumers
and
to
trademark
owners.
and
protection...
this
is
in
the
preamble
to
the
lanham
act.
and
it
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
lanham
act
was
to
foster
fair
competition,
and
by
taking
merely
descriptive
words
out
of
the
language
and
giving
them
to
one
party
to
their
exclusive
use
so
no
other
party
could
use
it
would
harm
competition.
and
there's
another
point
that
i
would
like--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--we
feel
that
park
and
fly
is
a
very
apt
shorthand
way
of
immediately
informing
prospective
users
of
our
parking
lot
what
those
services
are.
if
you
can
picture
the
words
"park
and
fly"
up
on
a
sign;
somebody
is
driving
around
near
an
airport,
they
see
that
sign,
they
know
immediately,
i
can
go
there
and
park
so
i
can
fly
on
a
plane.
they
know
it
immediately.
so
it
is
very
valuable
to
us
to
be
able
to
use
"park
and
fly".
other
companies
may
or
may
not
choose
to
use
"park
and
fly".
many
others
have
chosen
to
use
"park
and
fly",
and
the
record
is
replete
with
these
instances.
these
are
others
beside
petitioner,
extending
everywhere
from...
completely
across
the
country.
these
are
other
parties
that
have
used
"park
and
fly".
they've
selected
to
use
the
name
in
boston,
new
york,
philadelphia,
atlanta,
in
indiana,
in
denver,
los
angeles,
portland,
seattle,
and
over
a
very
widespread
period
of
time,
from
1970
at
least
through
the
time
of
trial,
1981.
in
the
district
court
case,
somebody
else
had
just
used
"park
and
fly"
in
portland,
another
party.
it's
a
term
that--
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
because
they
don't
operate
in
our
area.
they
would
actually
have
to
be
in
our
market
area
or
have
a
reputation.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
they
have
to
prove
likelihood
of
confusion.
they
would
have
to
be
in
our
market.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
they
could
attempt
to
enforce
the
mark.
it
would
be
a
valid
mark
if
they
showed
that
it
had
secondary
meaning.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
excuse
me?
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
they
would...
if
they
had
secondary
meaning
in
any
market,
then
they
would
have
a
valid
mark,
but
they
would
still
have
to
show
likelihood
of
confusion.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
no,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
they
may
not
have...
their
reputation
zone
may
not
extend
into
the
portland-seattle
area.
under
the
dawn
donut
rule,
they
actually
have
to
have
a
reputation
in
our
area.
they'd
have
to
be
in
our
area
or
have
a
reputation
in
our
area.
but
we
also
have
a
second,
very
fundamental
defense
here,
and
that
is
that
respondent
here
has
a
defense
under
subsection
(5)
of
1115(b),
and
that
is
the
so-called
innocent
user
defense.
and
respondent
had
use...
respondent's
in
privity
with
the
party
that
had
used.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
than
the
ninth
circuit's
theory,
yes,
the
offensive-defensive
dichotomy,
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we're
not
asking
for
cancellation.
mr.
john
m.
mccormack
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
