justice
white
is
it
true
that
a
mark
that
has
been
issued
or
granted
can
become
generic?
justice
white
let's
suppose
an
incontestable
mark
becomes
generic.
justice
white
what
about
your
theory
then?
justice
white
where
does
that
fall?
justice
white
1164,
but
it's
not
in--
justice
white
--but
it's
not
in
1115(b)?
justice
white
would
it
be
open
in
a
case
like
this
for
the
defendant
in
the
action
you
brought
to
say,
well,
it
was
generic
when
it
was
issued?
justice
white
but
you
think
that's
the
only...
because
the
essence
of
your
opponent's
case,
i
guess,
is
that
your
mark
should
never
have
been
issued,
or
that
it
certainly
shouldn't
have
been
made
incontestable.
justice
white
and
that
it
was
just
merely
descriptive.
justice
white
and
you
say
that
congress
itself
has
said
that
the
mark
could
be
cancelled
if
it
was
generic
or
becomes
generic,
but
it
didn't
say
merely
descriptiveness
would
be
a
ground?
justice
white
expressly,
you
say?
justice
white
--1064
is
the
cancellation
section,
isn't
it?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
you
would
say,
then,
that
the
mark
should
be
cancelled?
justice
white
you
said
it
never
should
have
been
issued
and
it's
always
open
to
challenge.
justice
white
well,
why
shouldn't
it
be
cancelled,
then?
justice
white
well,
mr.
mccormack,
how
do
you
parse
down
this
statute?
your
opponent
took
us
through
this
1115
and
said
that
that
listing
of
defenses
to
the
exclusive
rights
are
exhaustive,
except
for
genericness
that
is
incorporated
under
1064
and
1065.
now,
where
do
you
find
mere
descriptiveness
being
added
as
a
defense?
justice
white
genericness...
if
it
were
so
fundamental,
you
would
think
congress
would
have
mentioned
it
along
with
genericness.
justice
white
well,
it's
only...
it
isn't
very
confusing
if
you
read
it
the
way
it's
written.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
1064
and
1065
get
right
back
to
1052,
and
they
only
list,
what,
(b)
and
(c).
justice
white
well,
they
didn't
reach
(e).
justice
white
well,
but
you're
saying
that
it's
a
defense.
justice
white
so
if
there
hadn't
been...
if
this
mark
hadn't
gone
through
the
incontestability
proceeding,
it
had
just
been
issued,
and
then
this
suit
was
brought,
you
would
have
had
any
of
the
defenses
that
would
go
to
the
validity
of
the
mark?
justice
white
well,
suppose
the
mark
hadn't
been
made
incontestable.
justice
white
but
this
suit
was
brought
against
your
client.
your
client
would
have
had
the
right
to
claim
that
the
plaintiff's
mark
should
be
cancelled.
justice
white
on
any
of
the
grounds
that
should
have
prevented
its
issuance.
justice
white
and
so
you
say
the
incontestability
thing
just
goes
to
cancellation?
justice
white
and
then
what
happened?
justice
white
what
legal
argument?
justice
white
well,
then
the
examiner
must
have
at
least
implicitly
found
some
basis
for
issuing
the
mark.
justice
white
you
mean
the
examiner
just
says,
well,
i
don't
care
if
there's
a
legal
ground
for
it
or
not;
i'll
give
you
your
mark?
justice
white
stop
badgering
me?
justice
white
well,
you
must
be
saying
one
thing
or
the
other.
either
he
found
something
that
would
justify
issuance
of
the
mark
or
he
didn't.
justice
white
you
mean
he
made
a
mistake
in
the
sense
that
he
didn't
think
he
needed
a
ground
to
issue
it?
justice
white
he
mistakenly
found
a
ground?
justice
white
what
ground
is
that?
you
don't
know?
justice
white
all
right,
all
right.
so
he
did
find
that,
implicitly?
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
what
justice
o'connor
was
really
inquiring
about?
precisely.
well,
i
sure
didn't
understand
that...
i
thought
there
was
a
difference
between
merely
descriptive
and
being
descriptive
with
a
secondary
meaning.
they
did
address
the
descriptiveness
issue,
but
they
did
not
address
the
secondary
meaning
issue.
justice
white
well,
but
you
agree
that
he
implicitly
found
that
it
was.
he
must
have.
justice
white
which
is
a
valid
ground
for
issuing
it,
if
it
were
true.
justice
white
let
me
ask...
let
me
make
sure.
if
an
incontestable
mark
becomes
generic,
it
can
be
cancelled?
justice
white
so
that
you
just
wouldn't
lose
your
exclusive
right;
you
would
lose
the
mark.
justice
white
no,
i
understand.
justice
white
well,
suppose
one
of
the
defenses
is
proved
in
1115.
you
say
that
goes
to
the
validity
of
the
mark?
justice
white
not
just
whether
you
can
prevent
somebody
else
from
using,
not
just
to
your
exclusive
right?
