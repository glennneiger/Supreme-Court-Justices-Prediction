justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
can't
be
enforced,
mr.
popkin,
you
mean
that
your
client
could
not
get
an
injunction--
justice
rehnquist
--to
prevent
the
use
by
someone
else?
justice
rehnquist
your
opponent,
of
course,
contends
that,
because
the
registration
proceeding
in
the
trademark
officer
is
essentially
administrative
or
ex
parte,
if
your
construction
is
adopted
all
sorts
of
marks
that
don't
really
qualify
under
the
lanham
act
will
get
registered
and
there
will
be
never
any
adversary
process
for
challenging
them.
i
suppose
you
say
that's
what
congress
intended?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
mccormack,
well,
what
do
you
concede
or
agree
is
concluded
by
the
decision
of
the
trademark
office?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
petitioners
contend
that
congress
has
shackled
the
courts
from
reviewing
the
case
the
way
you
want
it
reviewed.
justice
rehnquist
i'm
saying
petitioner
has
contended
that.
i'm
not
saying
i
agree.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
a,
you
said,
an
1871
case.
the
lanham
act,
which
was
in
what,
1946
or
something?
justice
rehnquist
clearly,
that
may
have
superseded
some
of
our
old
cases.
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
mccormack,
under
your
theory
what
benefit
does
a
registrant
get
from
registering
his
mark
and
having
it
approved
by
the
patent
and
trademark
office?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
courts
should
always
have
the
power
to
review.
what's
the
source
of
that
statement?
is
that
just
your
idea
of
how
the
law
ought
to
run?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
court
decisions
interpreting
the
lanham
act?
justice
rehnquist
is
that
in
the
brief
somewhere?
justice
rehnquist
he
defended
it.
couldn't
the
provisions
of
section
1119
that
you
quoted
about
judicial
review
be
given
full
force
and
effect
by
saying,
that's
what
courts
can
do
during
the
period
of...
during
the
period
before
it
becomes
incontestable,
the
five-year
period?
justice
rehnquist
now,
what
does
incontestability
mean?
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that's
always
open,
notwithstanding
the
five-year
incontestability?
justice
rehnquist
well,
registration
and
incontestability
then
certainly
don't
mean
much
in
your
book.
justice
rehnquist
but
isn't
that
a
traditional
defense
to
an
injunction?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
said
defense
to
an
injunction,
not
a
defense
on
the
merits
of
the
copyright
action.
non-likelihood
of
confusion
i
would
think
could
be
analogized
to
unclean
hands,
the
kind
of
equitable
type
defenses
that
really
don't
go
to
the
substantive
law.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
feel
that
your
park
'n
fly
or
dollar
park
and
fly
can't
compete
with
the
petitioner
because
you
can't
use
the
name
dollar
park
and
fly?
