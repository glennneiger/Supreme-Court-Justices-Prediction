unknown
speaker
you
are
afraid
it
would?
unknown
speaker
would
it
interfere
with
your
judging
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
would?
unknown
speaker
so
what
standard
did
it
apply?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
let's
assume
we
decide
that's
wrong;
that
it's
really
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
correctness
because
it's
historical
fact,
like
bias.
and
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--we
don't
need
to
argue
whether
that's
right
or
wrong.
suppose
we
decide
that
they
applied
the
wrong
standard
to
this
case?
shouldn't
we
remand
it
and
have
them
review
it
under
the
correct
standard?
unknown
speaker
did
you
try
this
case,
mr.
mclain?
were
you
trial
counsel?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
defense
counsel
are
so
anxious
to
have
a
person
on
the
jury
who
expresses
reservations
such
as
are
made
here
in
at
least
four
responses,
does
that
tell
us
anything
about
whether
defense
counsel
wants
people
with
these
reservations
on
juries?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
totally
unbiased
juror?
that's
the
question.
a
juror
who
says
it
would
interfere
with
judging
the
guilt
or
innocence.
unknown
speaker
your
position
here
is
that
the
response
that
it
would
interfere
with
judging
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
shows
no
bias?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
really
have
to
read
witherspoon
in
light
of
adams,
too,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
trial
judge
has
the
benefit
that
no
reviewing
court
can
have
of
the
demeanor
evidence
of
the
witness.
what
seems
to
perhaps
suggest
ambiguity
on
the
record
may,
in
the
view
of
the
trial
judge,
in
view
of
facial
expressions
or
tone
of
voice,
convey
quite
a
different
mode.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
if
a
trial
court...
supposing
a
challenge
is
underway
for
bias,
not
on
the
witherspoon
ground,
but
just
on
the
grounds
that
the
witness
is
biased
against
the
plaintiff.
and
the
defense
lawyer
conducts...
or
is
biased
against
the
defendant.
the
prosecutor
conducts
voir
dire.
the
defendant
conducts
voir
dire.
and
the
trial
judge
then
says
the
witness
is
excused
for
cause.
are
you
suggesting
that
to
comply
with
2254
d,
the
trial
judge
would
have
to
go
further
and
say
the
reason
i
am
excusing
this
juror
for
cause
is
that
i
disbelieve
some
of
her
statements,
and
also
she
turned
red
when
she
was
asked
question
3?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
juror
says,
"well,
i
am
not
inalterably
opposed
to
the
death
penalty.
"
"i
don't
believe
in
it;
i
would
never
vote
for
it
if
i
were
a
legislator,
and
i
couldn't
say
that
i
never
would
vote
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
but
i'll
tell
you
right
now,
it's
very
likely
to
influence
the
way
i
decide
guilt
or
innocence.
"
"i
mean,
i'm
opposed
enough
to
it
that
it
would
warp
my
judgment,
i
think.
"
"just
inevitably,
it
would.
"
now,
could
that
juror
be
excused,
even
though
his
responses
to
the
death
penalty
questions
aren't
exactly
like
witherspoon?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
how
about
under
some
other
standard?
i
mean,
witherspoon
didn't
address
that.
all
witherspoon
addressed
was
how
opposed
do
you
have
to
be
to
the
death
penalty,
without
any
other
evidence,
to
assume
that
the
juror
can't
perform?
here,
a
juror
says,
"yes,
it
will.
"
"it
will.
"
"i'm
opposed
enough
that
it
will
influence
my
judgment.
"
unknown
speaker
"may
impair
my
judgment".
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
responses
here
are
comparable
to
the
adams
responses?
unknown
speaker
questions
and
responses.
the
inquiry
to
this
potential
juror.
do
you
think
they
are
essentially
the
same
in
both
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
mclain,
do
you
think
that
witherspoon
at
least
partially
cut
back
on
the
previously
established
general
rule
that
a
juror
who
said
that
they
could
not
faithfully
follow
the
court's
instructions
couldn't
sit
as
a
juror?
that
wasn't
my
impression.
unknown
speaker
witherspoon
simply
said,
as
i
understand
it,
if
you're
simply
excusing
people
because
they're
opposed
to
capital
punishment,
you're
excusing
a
group
of
people
who
are
entitled
to
sit
on
the
jury;
unless
you
would
go
further
and
say
no,
because
of
that
belief
they
couldn't
follow
the
court's
instructions.
so
the
general
principle
is,
if
you
can't
follow
the
court's
instructions
on
the
law,
you
can
be
excused.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
on
the
question
of
guilt
and
innocence.
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
it
a
question
of
fact
for
the
trial
judge
to
determine
whether
a
particular
prospective
juror
is
unbiased?
unknown
speaker
you
were
saying
that
on
this
record,
those
four
or
five
responses,
that
this
did
not
show
a
bias
that
would
have
affected
the
judgment
or
guilt
or
innocence?
unknown
speaker
then
you
and
i
aren't
reading
the
same
record.
unknown
speaker
and
you
base
this
all
on
the
idea
that
the
word
"interfere"
is
so
ambiguous
that
the
statement
that
it
would
interfere
with
judging
the
guilt
or
innocence
does
not
reflect
a
bias?
unknown
speaker
and
the
answer
to
that
was
yes;
that
it
would
interfere.
she
didn't
have
any...
the
juror
didn't
have
any
difficulty
in
understanding
what
"interfere"
meant.
unknown
speaker
when
the
juror
says,
"look,
it
will
interfere
with
my
ability
to
judge
guilt
or
innocence.
"
how
else
do
you
establish,
other
than
by
a
statement
of
the
juror?
unknown
speaker
how
much
more
do
you
have
to
ask?
you
ask
the
juror,
well,
what
do
you
mean
"interfere"?
"well,
i
would
be
more
likely
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
than
someone
who
hasn't
had
these
experiences.
"
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
might?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
be
the
inference
that
you
would
draw
from
the
juror's
statement,
"it
would
interfere
with
my...
these
kinds
of
experiences
would
interfere
with
my
finding
guilt
or
innocence?
"
