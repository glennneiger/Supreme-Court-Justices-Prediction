mr.
robert
j.
landry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
instant
case
presents
the
opportunity
for
this
court
to
address
and
decide
for
the
first
time
the
standard
of
review
which
should
be
made
by
federal
habeas
corpus
concerning
witherspoon
claims
brought
by
state
prisoners
in
habeas
corpus
actions.
the
decision
of
the
lower
court,
we
believe,
is
erroneous
and
must
be
reversed
because
it
is
not
mandated
by,
in
our
belief,
to
be
consistent
with
prior
supreme
court
decisions.
it
fails
to
accord
the
appropriate
deference
to
state
court
determinations
of
fact,
as
required
by
2254
d.
it
fails
to
accord
the
respect
to
the
federal
district
court
fact-finding
obligations
of
district
judges
under
rule
52,
and
announces
a
mechanistic
policy
which
is
more
conducive
to
adherence
to
form
rather
than
substance.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
provide
much-needed
clarification
to
the
lower
courts
in
this
regard
by
reiterating
that
the
position
of
witherspoon
and
his
progeny
is
that
a
prospective
juror
may
be
excused
for
cause
when
his
capital
punishment
views
are
such
that
he
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
follow
along
in
the
court's
instruction;
that
there
is
no
necessary
formula
to
be
employed
either
by
the
questioner
or
by
the
answer
given
by
the
prospective
juror;
that
a
juror
is
required
to
assure
the
trial
judge
that
he
can
follow
the
law
or
else
he
will
be
excused
for
cause
based
on
his
views;
and
that
because
of
the
unique
advantage
occupied
by
the
trial
judge
in
making
the
determinations
as
to
what
the
jury
is
saying
and
means,
that
wide
latitude
should
be
given
his
determinations.
very
briefly,
the
facts
in
this
case
which
brought
this
to
a
head,
johnny
paul
witt
was
tried
and
convicted
of
the
first
degree
murder
of
jonathan
kushner
and
received
a
sentence
of
death.
during
the
voir
dire
examination
of
one
of
the
jurors,
juror
colby,
the
prosecutor
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
the
juror
had
any
particular
personal
beliefs
against
capital
punishment.
the
juror
responded
that
she
had
some
personal
views
and
the
prosecutor
followed
that
up
with
a
series
of
questions:
first:
would
that
interfere
with
you
sitting
as
a
juror
in
this
case?
i'm
afraid
it
would.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
i
think
it
would.
at
this
point
the
prosecutor
moved
to
excuse
the
juror
for
cause.
the
defendant
neither
objected
to
the
removal
nor
asked
to
give
any
additional
clarifying
or
rehabilitative
questions
of
the
juror,
and
the
trial
court
granted
the
prosecutor's
motion
to
step
down.
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
test
for
habeas
corpus
in
reviewing
collateral
attacks,
witherspoon
claims,
is
the
presumption
of
correctness
outlined
in
2254
d
of
section
title
28.
the
policy
reasons
for
this
include
the
traditional
values
of
comedy
and
federalism
which
have
been
enunciated
in
previous
proceedings
in
this
court.
going
back
to
stone
v.
powell,
this
court
has
announced
that
state
judges
are
fully
capable
of
applying
constitutional
standards,
and
they
take
the
same
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution
as
do
the
federal
judges.
it
would
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
trial
as
a
main
event
in
a
scheme
of
the
criminal
justice
system
and
not
just
a
preliminary
round
or
a
trial
run
for
a
never-ending
cycle
of
appeals
and
post-conviction
motions.
it
would
develop
the
concept
of
finality
for
litigation.
instead
of
having
successive
repetitive
review
to
achieve
some
never-ending
idea
that
a
better
result
will
be
achieved,
the
courts
will
recognize
that
successive
review
merely
affords
an
opportunity
for
different
results.
and,
finally,
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
most
recently
recognized
the
importance
that
should
be
given
to
trial
judges
in
making
their
determinations
on
matters
of
fact
which
they
are
better
equipped
to
resolve.
most
of
these
values
which
i've
just
enunciated,
of
course,
are
most
adequately
and
demonstrated
most
forcefully
in
this
court
in
the
recent
opinion
of
patton
v.
young
which
was
decided
two
or
three
months
ago.
in
that
case
the
court
was
called
upon
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge's
determination
or
a
federal
court's
determination
as
to
whether
a
juror
was
biased
because
of
pretrial
prejudicial
publicity,
and
there
had
been
a
disagreement
among
the
state
court
and
the
federal
courts
about
that.
and
this
court
ruled
that
because
of
the
greater
opportunity
of
a
trial
judge
to
observe
the
demeanor
and
credibility
of
a
juror
in
responding
to
leading
questions,
listening
to
the
tone
of
the
responses
given,
that
greater
deference
should
be
given
to
the
trial
judge's
determination.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
in
the
instant
case
the
trial
judge
implicitly
found
that--
mr.
robert
j.
landry
--yes,
sir.
we
submit
that
the
requirements
of
2254
have
been
complied
with
here
because
we
have
an
adequate
written
indicia
in
the
record.
we
have
the
prosecutor
asking
questions
which
are
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
witherspoon.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
other
reliable
adequate
written
indicia,
we
submit,
is
the
transcript
of
the
trial,
including
the
questions
and
answers,
the
questions
propounded
by
the
prosecutor,
the
answers
given,
the
opportunity
for
the
defense
counsel
to
object
and
ask
further
clarifying
questions,
and
the
trial
judge's
statement,
his
ruling
at
that
point,
we
submit,
is
an
adequate
written
indicia.
it's
more
or
less
similar
to
the
situation,
we
think,
in
novelli
v.
dellarose
in
which
the
trial
judge
was
called
upon
to
make
a
determination
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
now,
he
did
not...
the
trial
judge
did
not
articulate
his
credibility
finding
that
he
believed
witness
a
rather
than
witness
b,
but
it
was
clear,
based
on
a
totality
of
reading
of
the
record
that
the
trial
judge
had
indeed
made
the
findings
that--
mr.
robert
j.
landry
--in
front
of
the
trial
court;
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
well,
the
statement
by
the
trial
judge
that
the
witness
was
excused
pursuant
to
the
prosecutor's
motion.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
i
don't
think
that
is
superfluous,
no.
but
i
think
where
we
have
an
indication
in
the
record
here
that
the
trial
judge
correctly
understood
the
appropriate
legal
standard,
then
his
conclusions,
factual
conclusions
that
he
utilized
to
formulate
the
decision
that
he
did,
must
be
given
respect.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
that's
indeed
correct,
that
it
was
unnecessary
really
for
the
trial
judge,
judge
ryder,
to
further
explicate
the
basis
for
his
ruling
by
the
fact
that
defense
counsel
did
not
object,
and
it
was
apparently
clear
to
everyone
in
the
courtroom
that
the
juror's
attitude
was
such
that
she
could
not
impartially
decide
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
i
say
that
the
four
responses
to
the
questions
propounded
by
the
prosecutor,
indicating
that
her
attitude
had
reached
a
plateau
of
interfering
with
the
ability
to
decide
guilt
or
innocence,
adequately
complies
with
witherspoon.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
yes,
sir.
to
the
extent
that
the
lower
court
believed
that
there
had
to
be
a
total
conformity
to
the
language
of
footnote
21
in
witherspoon,
he
was
mistaken.
the
restatement
in
adams
certainly
indicates
that
if
a
juror's
views
are
such
that
would
prevent
or
substantially
impair
his
performance,
he
may
be
excused
for
cause.
and,
of
course,
the
juror's
response
in
this
case
did
meet
that
criteria.
the
error,
we
believe,
of
the
eleventh
circuit
is
an
emphasis
on
requiring
that
there
be
an
exact
compliance
with
footnote
21
terminology.
now,
the
eleventh
circuit
apparently
has
held
that
"interfere
with",
used
by
the
prosecutor
or
by
trial
judge,
is
an
impermissibly
ambiguous
statement.
we
do
not
understand
it
to
be
so,
and
it
is
really
quite
unclear
as
to
when
that
phrase
became
ambiguous.
for
example,
at
footnote
5
of
witherspoon,
this
court
appears
to
have
implied
that
the
phrase,
"interfere
with
the
ability
to
determine
guilt
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
evidence.
"
was
interchangeable
and
synonymous
with
the
phrase
used
in
the
text,
"prevent
from
making
an
impartial
decision
as
to
guilt.
"
now,
if
the
court
in
writing
the
witherspoon
opinion
in
footnote
5
apparently
thought
or
at
least
implied
that
the
two
phrases
might
be
interchangeable,
certainly
the
prosecutor
and
the
trial
judge
cannot
be
criticized
for
similarly
regarding
the
two
phrases
as
the
equivalent
of
each
other.
in
any
event,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
there
was
no
complaint
by
mr.
witt
attacking
the
alleged
ambiguity
of
the
question
until
some
eight
years
after
his
trial
and
some
two
changes
in
lawyers
after
he
had
gone
through
his
direct
appeal,
attacking
only
the
response
given
by
the
juror,
and
similarly
attacking
that
response
in
the
federal
district
court,
judge
carr.
so,
consequently,
we
submit
that
the
lower
court
has
erred
in
requiring
a
strict
verbatim
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
footnote
21,
and
that
contention
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
ruling
is
inconsistent
with
the
subsequently
decided
case
of
this
court.
in
lockett
v.
ohio,
for
example,
this
court
did
not
require
a
strict
reading
of
footnote
21.
there,
the
jurors
were
asked
whether
or
not
they
could
take
an
oath
to
well
and
truly
try
the
case,
despite
their
views
on
capital
punishment.
and
negative
answers
to
that
question
led
to
their
excusal.
so
we
submit
that
it
is
not
really
the
form
of
the
question
or
the
answer
that
is
significant,
but
simply
the
total
context
of
what
the
response
given
is
as
to
whether
a
juror
is
able
and
willing
to
conform
with
the
law
or
not.
we
think
the
eleventh
circuit
has
erred
in
its
determinations,
and
that
this
case
is
exactly
the
same
as
adams
v.
texas.
we
submit
that
this
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
adams.
adams
was
a
case
involving
the
requirement
under
texas
law
that
someone
take
an
oath
that
he
would
not
be
affected
at
all
in
his
determinations
of
any
question
of
fact
based
on
his
views
of
capital
punishment.
he
was
not
asked
or
gave
no...
it
did
not
matter
whether
or
not
he
could
follow
the
law;
it
did
not
matter
that
he
could
set
aside
whatever
his
views
were.
if
they
had
any
kind
of
effect
at
all
on
his
fact-finding
deliberations
by
his
capital
punishment
views,
he
was
excused
and
apparently
could
not
even
be
rehabilitated.
so
the
state
of
florida
does
not
ask
or
require
anyone
not
to
be
affected
by
capital
punishment.
we
simply
insist
that
a
juror
be
willing
to
assure
the
trial
judge
that
he
can
follow
the
law
and
follow
the
instruction
of
the
court
and
follow
the
law
on
the
evidence.
if
he
is
not
willing
to
give
that
assurance,
then
we
submit
that
he
is
properly
excused
for
cause
under
lockett
v.
adams.
we
ask
this
court
to--
mr.
robert
j.
landry
--no,
ma'am.
if
the
juror
can
follow
the
law
and
according
to
the
instructions
given
and
the
evidence
adduced
at
court,
then
he
should
not
be
excused.
and
florida
does
not
insist
that
he
should
be.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
my
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
j.
landry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
initially
i'd
like
to
present
two
additional
facts
for
the
court's
attention.
first,
mr.
witt
did
argue
in
the
district
court,
contrary
to
the
state's
assertion,
that
the
prosecutor's
questions
were
ambiguous
and
improper
under
the
witherspoon
standard.
i'd
like
to
give
four
references
to
the
district
court
record.
