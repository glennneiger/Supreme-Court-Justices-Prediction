justice
jr.
exactly
what
findings
of
fact
did
the
trial
judge
make
here?
justice
jr.
he
didn't...
you
say
implicitly
found?
justice
jr.
well,
doesn't
24
d,
evidence
by
a
written
finding,
written
opinion,
or
other
reliable
and
adequate
written
indica?
justice
jr.
well,
the
only
totality
is
what
you
read
us,
i
gather.
that's
only
the
interrogation
or
the
colloquy
between
the
witness
and
the
prosecutor,
wasn't
it?
there's
nothing
else
in
the
record,
is
there?
justice
jr.
and
you're
asking
us
to
give
deference
under
2254
d
to
some
finding.
i
don't
quite
understand
what
finding
it
is
you're
asking
us
to
give
deference
to.
justice
jr.
all
he
said
was,
"all
right,
step
down".
justice
jr.
but
may
i
ask,
i
gather
the
witherspoon
formulation
is
that
you
can
remove
for
cause
only
those
who
make
it...
and
i'm
quoting
from
witherspoon...
"unmistakably
clear
that
they
would
automatically
vote
against
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
without
regard
to
any
evidence
that
might
be
developed
in
the
trial
in
the
case
before
them.
"
now,
what
is
it
in
that
colloquy
that
you
say
satisfies
that
you
say
satisfies
that
standard?
justice
jr.
i
don't
see
any
reference
to
guilt
or
innocence.
what
it
is
is
whether
that
would
interfere
with
you
sitting
as
a
juror.
isn't
one
of
the
questions,
would
it
interfere
with
the
judgment
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
in
this
case?
and
the
answer
was,
"i
think
so".
justice
jr.
well,
what's
your
answer
to
your
adversary's
argument
that
if
challenge
for
cause
was
sustained,
that
that
action
in
and
of
itself
carries
with
it
findings?
