mr.
landry,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
is
it
possible
that
the
trial
judge
hearing
this
examination
of
the
potential
juror
respond
at
least
four
times,
saying,
"i'm
afraid,
it
would",
"yes,
i
am
afraid
it
would.
"
"i
think
so",
and
"i
think
it
would",
felt
that
that
was
so
clear
that
no
findings
were
necessary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
mclain.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
if
the
court
or
the
district
court
had
made
findings,
that
could
have
remedied
this
problem?
or
the
absence
of
findings,
is
the
absence
of
findings
irrelevant?
chief
justice
burger
if
the
district
judge,
the
trial
judge
had
thought
that
some
findings
were
either
necessary
or
helpful,
do
you
suppose
he
might
have
been
dissuaded
from
making
them
by
the
fact
that
there
was
no
objection
to
the
excusing
of
this
juror?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
mclain.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
landry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
