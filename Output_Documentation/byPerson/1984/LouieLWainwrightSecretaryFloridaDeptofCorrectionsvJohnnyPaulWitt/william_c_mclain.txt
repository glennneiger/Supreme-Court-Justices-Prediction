mr.
william
c.
mclain
it
was
not
focused
on
in
the
florida
trial
court,
and
i
would
point
out...
the
second
fact
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
was
that
mr.
witt's
trial
counsel
in
the
state
trial
court
and
on
appeal
admitted,
in
a
deposition
which
was
introduced
into
evidence
at
the
habeas
hearing,
that
he
was
not
even
aware
of
the
witherspoon
decision
as
the
time
he
selected
the
jury
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
his
failure
to
raise
it
in
the
trial
court...
the
florida
supreme
court
addressed
this
question
on
the
merits.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
his
statement
in
the
deposition
explains
why:
that
he
was
unfamiliar
with
the
witherspoon
standard
at
the
time
he
selected
the
jury.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
just
saying
as
an
explanation
of
perhaps
why
he
didn't
do
anything
and
why
it
can't
be
indicative
of
a
demeanor
finding
in
the
trial
court
on
his
part
for
failing
to
object.
we
can't
say
that
he
perceived
it
as
being
unmistakably
clear,
because
he
was
not
aware
of
the
witherspoon
standard
at
that
time.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
i
think
adams
v.
texas
really
controls
this
decision
because
the
term
"interfere"
as
used
in
his
questions
in
this
case
suffers
the
same
flaw
as
did
the
term
"affect"
in
the
questions
used
in
the
texas
case.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
the
absence...
i
don't
think
the
witherspoon
question,
whether
witherspoon
questions
are
treated
as
ones
involving
historical
fact,
accorded
the
presumption
of
correctness
under
2254
d,
is
really
relevant
to
deciding
this
case
at
all,
because
even
under
the
terms
of
2254
d,
the
pertinent
fact
for
dispute
was
not
decided.
we
have
no
findings
of
fact
in
this
case,
either
explicit
findings
or
implicit
findings.
consequently,
the
issue,
the
applicability
of
2254
d,
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
that
may
have
been
the
case,
your
honor.
i
can
only
speculate.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
i
don't
think
this
record
is
capable
of
demonstrating
an
implicit
finding
of
fact.
first,
because
there
is
no
indication
that
the
trial
court
used
the
correct
legal
standard
in
excusing
juror
colby
for
cause.
we
cannot
infer
a
finding
of
fact
where
there
is
no
clear
legal
standard
employed.
we
don't
know
whether
the
trial
judge
was
operating
under
the
correct
witherspoon
standard,
for
a
number
of
reasons:
first,
one
was
not
articulated
at
the
time
juror
colby
was
excused.
furthermore,
we
cannot
presume
that
the
trial
court
was
using
the
correct
legal
standard
because
of
the
state
of
florida
law
at
the
time.
in
florida,
1969
decision,
williams
v.
state,
the
florida
court
adopted
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
witherspoon
standard
from
the
new
jersey
case,
state
v.
mathis,
which
would
allow
the
excusal
of
jurors
for
cause
precisely
because
their
responses
to
the
inquiry
were
equivocal.
the
florida
court
adopted
that
rule
in
williams,
and
i
would
note
that
the
state,
on
direct
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
argued
both
williams
and
mathis
to
that
court.
also
note
that
subsequent
to
mr.
witt's
trial
and
appeal,
the
florida
court
is
perhaps
still
laboring
under
this
erroneous
rule.
as
recently
as
1980
in
brown
v.
state,
the
rule
was
again
quoted
and
articulated
in
the
florida
supreme
court
decision.
the
court
ruled
in
this
case
solely
upon
prosecutor's
inquiry,
solely
upon
the
ambiguous
questions,
which
did
not
employ
the
correct
legal
standard
under
adams.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
it
implies
the
judge
did
not,
by
acting
upon
the
prosecutor's
inquiry
alone
which
did
not
comply
with
the
witherspoon
standard.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
i
don't...
it
would
not
in
this
case
because
of
the
nature
of
the
questions.
the
term
"interfere"...
and
i
think
we
have
to
focus
on
how
the
jurors,
a
reasonable
juror
might
have
interpreted
the
word
"interfere".
and
that
may
be
quite
a
bit
different
than
the
way
it's
treated
by
commentators
or
members
of
this
court
in
writing
opinions.
but
the
"interfere"
term
is
not
as
clear
as
the
term
"prevent".
and
it
is
subject
to
varying
interpretations.
and
therein
lies
the
difficulty
in
gleaning
a
finding
of
fact
in
this
record.
even
if
we
had
an
unequivocal
yes
answer
from
juror
colby
to
a
question
that
merely
asked
if
her
beliefs
would
interfere,
we
still
don't
know
the
profundity
of
that
interference
or
the
degree
of
that
interference.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
yes,
your
honor.
again
i
say
the
term
has
to
be
evaluated
in
the
manner
in
which
it
might
reasonably
be
construed
by
a
juror.
and
it
is
subject
to
differing
interpretations.
some
of
those
interpretations--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--your
honor,
the
court
below
noted
that
there
was
some
uncertainty
in
the
lower
courts.
footnote
10
of
the
opinion--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--the
court
conducted
an
independent
review
of
the
record.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
i
don't--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--well,
in
footnote
10
of
their
opinion,
they
noted
the
uncertainty
regarding
the
standard
to
be
employed
in
reviewing
findings
of
fact
in
the
witherspoon
context.
however,
they
went
on
to
say
that
even
under
the
least
rigorous
standard,
the
2254
d
standard,
that
they
would
have
reached
the
same
results,
and
for
the
reasons
that
there
were
no
findings
made
by
the
trial
court
which
warranted
deference.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
i
was
not
trial
counsel
in
the
state
court.
i
was
co-counsel
in
the
district
court,
and
i
was
counsel
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
william
c.
mclain
the
witherspoon
standard
requires
the
state
to
make
an
affirmative
showing
that
the
juror
is,
in
fact,
impartial.
when
there
is
an
ambiguous
showing
of
whether
the
juror
is
impartial,
then
witherspoon
does
not
permit
the
exclusion
of
that
juror.
if
the
juror
were
unable
to
answer--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--it
perhaps
shows
an
uncertainty
regarding
the
position
of
the
juror,
but
it
does
not
make
unmistakably
clear
that
the
juror
would
be
prevented
from--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
again,
we
go
right
back
to
the
possible
interpretations
of
the
term
"interfere",
and
the
possible
interpretations
the
jurors
could
reasonably
impose
upon
that
term.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
are
not
contending
that
there
should
be
absolutely
no
deference
paid
to
any
pertinent
demeanor
findings
made
by
a
trial
court,
even--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--i
think
certainly
24...
perhaps
not
required
for
application
of
2254
d,
in
that
there
could
be
an
implicit
finding
of
fact
in
that
case,
provided
the
correct
legal
standard
was
employed.
however,
when
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
of
excusing
jurors
because
of
some
personal
bias,
we're
really
dealing
with
a
different
standard
than
we're
dealing
with
in
the
witherspoon
context.
in
the
witherspoon
context,
we're
talking
about
a
much
higher
standard
and
an
affirmative
showing
on
the
part
of
the
state
regarding
the
juror's
beliefs
and
the
impact
of
those
beliefs
on
the
ability
to
judge
the
case
impartially.
in
excusing
a
juror
because
of
some
personal
bias,
it's
really
a
negative
showing
there
as
opposed
to
an
affirmative
showing.
and,
furthermore,
the
witherspoon
standard
is...
part
of
the
constitutional
standard
established
in
witherspoon
is
a
higher
standard
for
excusal
for
cause
because
it's
excusing
a
class
of
jurors
based
upon
their
beliefs,
as
opposed
to
an
individual
juror
based
upon
some
personal
bias.
i
would
note
that
i
think
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
has,
in
a
later
case,
after
this
decision...
the
darden
case...
articulated
what
is
perhaps
the
correct
standard
of
review
in
the
witherspoon
questions.
an
independent
review
of
the
record
to
ensure
that
the
correct
witherspoon
standard
has
been
faithfully
met
and
satisfied
but,
at
the
same
time,
recognizing
that,
where
appropriate,
some
deference
should
be
given
to
trial
court
findings.
this
strikes
a
balance
between
the
witherspoon
standard
and
the
need
to
ensure
that
that
legal
standard
is
appropriately
complied
with
and
with
the
need
to
give
appropriate
deference
to
demeanor
findings
by
the
state
trial
court.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
that
juror
could
be
excused
if
that
bias
was
a
product
of
opposition
to
the
death
penalty;
that
under
no
circumstances--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--i
don't
recall
witherspoon
addressing
that
precise
question.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
what
we
have
here,
because
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
was
focusing
directly
upon
this
juror's
opposition
to
the
death
penalty.
and
when
that
focus
takes
shape,
then
the
witherspoon
standard
must
be
applied.
i
would
note
that
the
standard
of
review
articulated
by
the
eleventh
circuit
in
the
darden
case,
while
not
giving
the
presumption
of
correctness
to
the
findings
of
fact,
still
does
strike
the
appropriate
balance
to
be
made
between
independent
review
of
the
record
to
ensure
the
witherspoon
standard
is
appropriately
applied,
and
still
giving
respect
due
to
state
court
findings.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
under
the
witherspoon
standard,
that
juror
could
not
be
excused
based
upon--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--i
think
this
court--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--this
court,
in
adams
v.
texas,
held
that
those
kinds
of
feelings,
even
though
the
juror
could
nevertheless
indicate
that
they
could
judge
the
case
on
the
evidence,
but
candidly
admitted
that
their
beliefs
might
have
some
influence,
this
court
in
adams
v.
texas
said
that
juror
could
not
be
excluded
under
the
witherspoon
standard.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
the...
excuse
me...
the
responses
or
the
questions?
mr.
william
c.
mclain
essentially
the
same;
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
the
jurors
who
say
they
cannot
follow
the
court's
instructions
or
the
law
in
deciding
the
case
would
not
be
permitted
to
sit
as
a
juror.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
it
must
be
an
affirmative
showing
by
the
state
before
the
excusal
is
proper.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
of
unbiased
jurors?
mr.
william
c.
mclain
well,
certainly
the--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--certainly,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
an
unbiased
jury.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
it
is
a
determination
for
the
trial
judge
to
make,
of
course,
whether
a
juror
is
biased
or
not
biased,
or
whether
a
juror,
as
in
this
case,
fits
under
the
witherspoon
standard.
of
course,
that's
an
initial
determination
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not
show
a
bias
that
would
have...
perhaps
affect
it,
but
again--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--the
juror...
the
juror
indicated
that
her
beliefs,
she
thought,
might
interfere.
however,
she
was
never
asked
the
question
of
whether
she
could
set...
sit
whatever
interference
it
might
pose
aside,
and
nevertheless
follow
the
law
in
the
evidence.
she
was
never
instructed,
in
putting
her
inquiry
in
a
little
more
context
perhaps.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
it
does
not
reflect
an
adequate
bias
for
an
excusal
under
witherspoon.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
we
still
don't
know,
we
still
can't
glean
the
interpretation
the
juror
was
placing
on
the
word
"interfere".
she
may
have
thought
"interfere",
to
the
extent
of
making
the
decision
more
difficult
for
her,
but
nevertheless
she
could
set
that...
may
have
been
able
to
set
that
difficulty
aside
and
still
the
follow
the
evidence
and
the
law
of
the
case,
and
decide
the
case
impartially.
i
think
anytime
we're
dealing
with
jurors,
human
beings
are
going
to
have
factors
or
variables
that's
going
to
make
certain
decisions
less
comfortable
for
them
to
make,
and
that's
inherent
in
the
jury
system.
but
that
is
not
a
reason
for
excluding
the
juror,
just
because
the
decisionmaking
process
may
be
made
uncomfortable
for
them.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
i
think
only
if
the
defendant...
excusal
for
cause
would
be
appropriate
only
if
the
defendant
could
establish
that
that
interference
would
prevent
her
from--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--that...
again,
the
inability
of
the
juror
to
nevertheless
follow
the
law
has
not
been
established
by
the
inquiry.
certainly
there
are
things
in
that
juror's
background
which
would
create
difficult
in
deciding
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
we
still,
going
back
to
the
inquiry
in
this
case,
we
just...
we
can't
determine,
because
of
the
ambiguity,
both
in
the
questions
and
the
responses.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
that
might
very
well
be
enough.
mr.
william
c.
mclain
i
think
that
would
probably
be
a
basis
for
excusing
the
juror.
but
again,
the
appropriate
witherspoon--
mr.
william
c.
mclain
--we
still
come
back
to
the
question,
"interfere"
simply
does
not
mean,
or
necessarily
mean
to
each
and
every
juror
responding
to
such
a
question,
prevent
the
ability
to
follow
the
law
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
assign
guilt.
and
we
also
have
a
different
situation
when
we're
talking
about
the
state
excusing
a
juror
under
the
witherspoon
standard
and
the
defense's
position
of
excusing
a
juror
under
some
other
personal
bias
standard.
i
think
the
witherspoon
standard
was
imposed
upon
the
state
to
assure
that
an
inappropriate,
overbroad
restriction
of
the
jury
pool
does
not
occur.
my
time
is
short.
in
view
of
the
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
