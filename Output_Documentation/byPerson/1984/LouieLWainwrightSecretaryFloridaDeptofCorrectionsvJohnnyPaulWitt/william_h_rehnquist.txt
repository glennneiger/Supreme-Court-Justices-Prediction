justice
rehnquist
mr.
landry,
let
me
read
you
a
more
recent
formulation
of
the
witherspoon
past
remark
the
case
of
adams
v.
texas.
where
the
court
said
this
line
of
cases
has
established
that
a
juror
may
not
be
challenged
for
cause
based
on
his
views
about
capital
punishment
unless
those
views
would
prevent
or
substantially
impair
the
performance
of
his
duties
as
a
juror
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
and
his
oath.
i
take
it
your
submission
is
that
the
trial
judge's
ruling
at
the
close
of
the
colloquy
certainly
satisfied
that
standard.
justice
rehnquist
did
he
ever
argue
that
in
the
florida
trial
court?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
bear
on
his
failure
to
raise
it
in
the
trial
court?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
i
realize
that
there
is
a
proper
basis
for
finding
that
there
has
been
no
wainwright
v.
sykes
bar.
but
when
you're
insisting,
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
defense
lawyer
in
a
criminal
case,
that
a
question
on
voir
dire
by
the
prosecutor
is
not
as
precise
as
it
should
be
or
doesn't
use
the
right
words,
don't
you
have
some
obligation
if
you're
going
to
make
that
point
later,
to
try
to
focus
on
the
question
and
ask
some
questions
yourself?
this
defense
counsel
just
stood
mute.
justice
rehnquist
does
that
bear
on
his
obligation,
if
the
point
is
later
to
be
made,
eight
years
later
in
the
case,
that
a
particular
question
on
voir
dire
wasn't
proper,
that
he
ought
to
do
something
about
it
then?
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
it's
the
judge
who
has
to...
and
i
think
the
adams
language
doesn't
really
use
the
words
"unmistakably
clear".
it
says,
"based
on
his
views
about
capital
punishment,
unless
those
views
would
prevent
or
substantially
impair
the
performance
of
his
duties
as
a
juror.
"
that's
really
a
more
recent
formulation
and
it's
in
the
text
rather
than
the
footnote.
