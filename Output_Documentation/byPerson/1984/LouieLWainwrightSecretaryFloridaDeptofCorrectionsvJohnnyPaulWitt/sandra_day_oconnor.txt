justice
o'connor
well,
if
a
juror
were
to
say
the
juror
was
opposed
to
capital
punishment
but
nevertheless
could
decide
the
case
based
on
the
evidence
and
the
instructions,
would
that
give
rise
to
any
excuse
for
cause
on
the
part
of
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
language,
though,
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
landry,
in
witherspoon
itself,
using
the
word
"interfere",
where
the
court
said
courts
and
other
states
have
sometimes
permitted
the
exclusion
for
cause
of
jurors
opposed
to
the
death
penalty,
even
in
an
absence
of
a
showing
that
their
scruples
would
have
interfered
with
their
ability
to
determine
guilt
and
so
forth.
there
is
discussion
using
the
word
"interfered".
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mclain,
is
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
holding
in
witherspoon
simply
to
prevent
the
state
from
excusing
for
cause
jurors
who
are
opposed
to
capital
punishment?
that
that
enough
isn't
sufficient
to
find
an
excuse
for
cause.
but
is
there
anything
in
witherspoon
that
says
if
a
juror
is
found
to
be
biased
on
the
question
of
finding
guilt
or
innocence,
either
way,
that
that
juror
should
not
be
excused?
in
other
words,
if
a
juror,
a
trial
prospective
juror,
is
determined
to
be
biased
on
the
question
of
finding
guilt
or
innocence,
the
juror
is
unable
to
follow
the
court's
instructions
or
unable
to
decide
the
case
based
on
the
evidence,
is
there
anything
in
witherspoon
that
prevents
excusing
such
a
juror
for
cause,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
for
whatever
reason,
including
opposition
to
the
death
penalty.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
what
we
have
here
really?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
fact,
doesn't
the
sixth
amendment
and
due
process
probably
require
unbiased
jurors
on
the
guilt/innocence
question?
isn't
that
a
separate
constitutional
requirement,
probably?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
juror,
on
voir
dire,
discloses
that,...
for
instance,
in
this
case
miss
colby
disclosed
that
her
brother
was
a
policeman
who'd
been
injured
in
the
line
of
duty,
and
her
brother-in-law
was
a
county
prosecutor
at
one
time,
and
she
responds
in
answer
to
a
question
about
whether
that
would
interfere
with
her
sitting
as
a
trial
juror
in
the
case,
she
responds,
"well,
i
think
it
would,
actually.
"
"i'm
afraid
it
would
interfere
with
my
ability
to
judge
the
guilt
or
innocence.
"
do
you
think
the
defendant
would
have
a
right
to
excuse
that
juror
for
cause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
on
that
exchange:
is
that
enough,
do
you
think?
wouldn't
you
be
in
here
arguing
if
that
had
been
denied
to
you,
that
the
court
should
have
excused
that
juror
for
cause?
