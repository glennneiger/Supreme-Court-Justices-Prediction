mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
first
briefly
discuss
our
waiver
argument
with
reference
to
the
colloquy
that
justice
rehnquist
had
with
my
opponent.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
am
sorry.
i
would
like
to
first
briefly
discuss
the
waiver
argument
with
reference
to
the
colloquy
that
justice
rehnquist
had
with
my
opponent.
in
the
court
of
appeals
there
was
no
request
that
one
of
the
convictions
be
vacated.
the
only
reference
to
the
convictions
was
that
there
was
an
appeal
from
the
convictions,
but
this
relief
was
not
requested,
and
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
possibility
of
adverse
consequences
as
a
result
of
the
additional
conviction
and
the
other
issues
that
are
before
this
court.
therefore,
we
believe
that
the
waiver
argument
is
valid,
and
that
it
provides
grounds
for
the
court
to
dispose
of
the
case
without
reaching
the
merits.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
relief
that
is
requested
here
and
the
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--is
the
conviction.
they
don't
seem...
in
the
court
of
appeals
they
didn't
make
any
distinction
as
to
why
vacating
a
sentence
would
provide
some
additional
relief
that
making
these
sentences
run
concurrently,
which
was
their
alternate
remedy,
would
not.
here
they
seem
to
distinguish
the
remedy
provided
by
vacating
one
of
the
convictions
on
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor.
we
take
issue
with
the
contention
that
the
second
sentence
would
be
a
burden.
we
think
that
the
import
of
the
court
of
appeals
mandate
was
that
the
petitioner
not
serve
more
than
three
years
in
prison,
and
we
think
that
any
decision
by
the
district
judge--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
think
that
the
concept
of
being
on
probation
while
someone
is
in
prison
is
a
difficult
one.
we
think
certainly
the
district...
any
deprivation
of
probation
that
results--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--of
course,
we
think
there
would
be
no
difference
if
the
second
sentence
was
a
committed
sentence
rather
than
suspended
in
favor
of
probation,
and
we
think
that
under
the
mandate,
the
petitioner
could
move
under
rule
35
for
an
alteration
of
the
sentence
to
make
it--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
he
could
serve
the
whole
sentence
from
scratch,
but
we--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
we
think
that
the
district
court
couldn't
order
that
longer
sentence
under
the
court
of
appeals
mandate,
that
the
clear
import
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
that
the
petitioner
not
serve
more
than
three
years
in
prison,
and
that
any
result
vis-a-vis
the
suspended
sentence
that
had
that
effect
would
be
improper.
and
we
would
in
fact
support
a
rule
35
motion
to
alter
the
second
sentence
to
make
it
a
committed
sentence
to
avoid
that
slim
possibility.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
the
government's
interest
is
not
very
great
with
respect
to
the
convictions
in
this
case.
the
government's
concern
is
that
a
decision
by
this
court,
for
example,
that
a
conviction
that
carries
no
adverse
consequences
constitutes
punishment
could
adversely...
could
conflict
with
the
justification
for
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
well,
we
didn't
intend
cumulative
punishment.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
would
object.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
there
may
be--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
part
of
the
problem
is
that
our
position
depends
upon
the
facts
of
the
case.
there
are...
under
these
two
statutes
there
are
situations
in
which
multiple
punishment
would
be
appropriate,
for
example,
if
multiple
firearms
were
involved.
that
isn't
true
in
this
case,
but
that
might
be
true
in
another
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
and
we
feel
that
there
is
no
harm
to
the
defendant
if
there
is
an
additional
conviction
where
it
carries
no
adverse
consequences.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
in
this
case,
we
contend
that
they
are
nonexistent.
they
might
be
existent
in
another
case.
here
the
parole
board
has--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
the
adverse
consequences
also
would
have
to
rise
to
the
level
of
multiple
punishment.
for
example,
a
consequence
in
another
proceeding
would
not
constitute
multiple
punishment
in
this
proceeding.
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
might
be
subject
to
punishment
under
a
habitual
offender
statute
for
a
different
crime
wouldn't
constitute
multiple
punishment
for
this
crime
under
the
court's
decisions
in
kryger.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
because
the
defendant
will
be
serving--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
the
defendant
won't
be
serving
any
additional
time
in
prison.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
in
a
successive
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
the
multiple
punishment
question?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
because
in
your
hypothetical--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
both
of
the
counts
were
tried
in
one
prosecution,
so
there
is
no
successive
prosecution
problem.
that
portion
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
isn't
implicated
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
our
problem
is,
we
wouldn't
object
if
the
district
judge
in
this
case
had,
after
the
jury
returned
its
verdict,
vacated
one
of
the
convictions
subject
to
the
condition
that
if
the
unvacated
conviction
was
ever
overturned,
the
first
conviction
would
be
reinstated.
our
problem
is
that
a
decision
by
this
court
holding
that
the
vacation
of
the
conviction
was
required
would
conflict
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
for
example,
would
conflict
with
the
rationale
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
because
it
would
rest
on
the
notion
that
the
mere
fact
of
a
conviction
without
any
adverse
consequences
was
sufficient
prejudice
or
sufficient
punishment
to
require
elimination.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no
we
don't,
your
honor.
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
additional
punishment.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
our
view
of
punishment,
justice
rehnquist,
is
additional
time
in
prison
or
an
additional
fine,
the
facts
that
have
been
relied
upon
in
this
court's
cases
discussing
the
cumulative
punishment
rule.
there
is
no
additional
time
in
prison,
and
no
additional
fine
in
this
case,
and
we
don't
believe--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no.
we
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
punishment.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
two
recidivist--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--your
honor--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
most
recidivist
statutes
adopt
the
rule
that
the
two
statutes
cited
by
the
petitioner
adopt,
which
is
that
if
the
two
convictions
are
imposed
in
a
single
proceeding,
they
count
as
only
one
conviction
for
the
purposes
of
the
habitual
offender
statute.
therefore,
the
petitioner
is
not
prejudiced
under
those
statutes,
because
the
two
convictions
only
count
as
one.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
covers
all
of
them,
but
i
think
it
covers
most
of
them.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
he
would
have
a
problem,
because
i
don't
think
that
that
it
is
still
any
prejudice
that
he
has
incurred
right
now
from
the
two
sentences.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
two
concurrent
sentences.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
our
concern
is
not
with
petitioner's
concurrent
sentence.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
justice
o'connor.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
there
could
be
a
question
on
legislative
intent,
although--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
you
would,
although--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--batchelder
teaches
that
there
are
two
separate
statutes
that
can
be
independently
applied,
and
we
think
that
if
that
was
congress's
intent,
that
would
indicate
the
two
convictions
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
that
portion
of
batchelder
speaks
to
the
argument
that
was
raised
is
that
case
that
the
government
could
not
choose
to
elect
between
the
two
statutes
because
of
the
different
penalty
provisions,
and
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
said
the
government
was
free
to
choose.
we
don't
think
that
batchelder
says
that
the
government
was
required
to
choose.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
justice
rehnquist,
except
that
the
petitioner's
request
is
that
there
be
a
bar
on
the
entry
of
two
convictions.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
have
no
objection
to
the
district
court...
to
justice
white's
suggestion
that
the
district
court
enter
sentence
on
only
one
of
the
convictions.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
we
think
that
does
end
up
splitting
hairs,
but
that
is
one
of
the
reason
why
we
think
that
the
petitioner...
the
remedy
requested
by
the
petitioner
just
isn't
appropriate.
there
jus
isn't
any...
there
isn't
any
inquiry
that
can
be
made
and
it
will
just
lead
to
litigation
over
this
coast
of
weather
congress
intended
two
convictions
or
on
conviction,
and
it--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
he
would
have
to
put
two.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
it
might
be
prejudicial.
we
don't
think
that
it
is
punishment
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
reaches.
the
petitioner
her
did
violate
two...
was
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
have
violated
two
offenses,
and
we
don't
think
that
it
is
unfair
that
he
be
subjected
to
the
consequence
that
flow
from
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
legislative
intent
is
the
inquiry,
justice
rehnquist,
but
in
order
for
there
to
be...
for
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
supply
a
remedy,
if
you
will,
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
a
double
punishment
that
it
would
reach.
it
may
be
that
even
though
congress...
that
even
though
the
legislative
intent
isn't
clear,
the
effect
still
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
punishment
that
the
constitution
provides
a
remedy
for,
such
as
a
conviction
that
doesn't
have
an
adverse
consequence.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because
in
order
for
that
clause
to
provide
a
remedy,
there
has
to
be
some...
even
if
there
is
a
deviation
from
what
congress
intended,
there
still
would
have
to
be
some
kind
of
a
multiple
punishment
in
order
for
a
petitioner,
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
rely
on
a
clause
as
supplying
some
kind
of
an
affirmative
remedy.
i
just
want
to
reiterate
our
argument
based
on
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
because
we
believe
that
really
the
principle
underlying
that
doctrine
supports
our
position
in
this
case,
because
the
doctrine
really
as
it
is
now
applied
by
the
courts
of
appeals
is
based
on
the
notion
that
a
conviction
with
no
adverse
consequences
will
not
prejudice
a
defendant,
and
therefore
the
conviction
can
be
affirmed
even
though
it
is
unreviewed.
if
petitioner
is
punished
in
some
way
by
the
second
conviction,
then
it
conflicts
with
this
notion
that
there
is
no
prejudice,
and
therefore
could
undermine
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
which
we
believe
is
a
useful
tool
used
by
the
courts
of
appeals
to
avoid
reaching
issues
that
don't
really
have
to
be
decided.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
