justice
white
well,
you
can't
punish
them.
the
only
rule
that
seems
to
come
through
is
that
he
can't
be
punished
for
both.
justice
white
the
question
the
government
may
have
to
elect
which
to
proceed
on
before
trial.
justice
white
are
you
arguing
that
the
government
should
have
to
elect
which
statute
to
proceed
under
before
trial?
justice
white
when
does
the
limitation
on
the
conviction
come,
when
the
judge
instructs
the
jury
and
you
tell
the
jury
you
can
only
convict
on
one
of
these?
justice
white
is
that
what
you
think
should
happen?
justice
white
because
you
think
that
is
the
intent
of
congress?
justice
white
well,
assuming
you
are
right,
but
there
are
still
concurrent
sentences,
and
you
must
at
least
convince
us
that
the
two
convictions
instead
of
one
will
have
an
adverse
consequence
on
your
client.
justice
white
on
that
basis,
the
whole
concurrent...
that
approach
would
undermine
the
entire
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
if
there
ever
was
one.
justice
white
because
your
argument
would
almost
always
be
true.
justice
white
well,
what
possible
interest
does
the
government
have
in
sustaining
both
convictions?
justice
white
well,
i
thought...
you
agree
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
have...
for
a
defendant
to
be
punished
under
both
statutes.
justice
white
well,
would
you
say
it
would
satisfy
all
the
interests
you
had
if
the
judge...
would
you
object
to
an
instruction
by
a
judge
to
a
jury
that
you
can
convict
under
one
of
these
statutes
but
not
under
the
other...
but
not
under
both?
justice
white
why
would
you
object?
he
certainly
can't
sentence
consecutively
under
both.
justice
white
what
possible
interest
do
you
have
in
having
a
sentence
imposed
under
both
statutes
if
they
must
run
concurrently?
justice
white
let's
assume
it
did
carry
some
adverse
consequences.
namely,
let's
just
assume
you
agree
that
having
two
convictions
on
the
record
instead
of
one
would
affect
parole
decisions
or
later
the
possibility
of
being
prosecuted
as
a
recidivist.
do
you
say
that
those
consequences
are
just
nonexistent,
or
just
too
remote,
or
what?
justice
white
if
we
disagree
with
you,
then
you
lose
the
case?
is
that
it,
on
that,
if
it
does
have
some
adverse
consequences?
say
we
agree
with
your
opponent.
justice
white
if
you
have
two
sentences,
you
have
two
sentences
in
this
case.
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
multiple
punishment.
justice
white
you've
imposed
two
sentences.
how
do
you...
that
is
not
one.
it
is
two.
justice
white
that
may
be
so,
but
he
has
still
got
two
sentences,
and
two
sentences
have
adverse
consequences
outside
this
proceeding.
mr.
pincus,
suppose
there
had
been
two
indictment,
one
on
each
of
these
counts,
instead
of
one
indictment
with
two
counts,
or
one
information
with
two
counts.
he
is
convicted
on
the
first
one.
do
you
think
there
would
be
available
to
him
a
double
jeopardy
or
some
ether
defense
on
the
second
indictment,
the
second
one
brought
to
trial?
justice
white
the
government's
interest,
i
take
it,
is
in
maintaining
the
conviction.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
ordered
the
district
court
to
vacate
either
one
of
the
sentences
but
leave
the
conviction
standing,
you
would
be
quite
satisfied.
justice
white
so
you
don't
really
mean
that
the
concurrent
sentence
would
have
to
stand.
justice
white
so
if
the
district
court,
after
a
jury
convicts
on
both
sentences,
says
i
will
enter
a
sentence
on
one
of
the
counts
and
suspends
sentence
on
the
other,
you
would
be
satisfied?
justice
white
i
don't
know
how
you
ascertain
that.
the
intent
of
congress
was
two
convictions
and
one
sentence.
that
is
what
they
clearly
intended.
rather
ridiculous,
i
think.
