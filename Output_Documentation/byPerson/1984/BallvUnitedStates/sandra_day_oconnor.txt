justice
o'connor
ms.
widener,
does
conviction
alone
constitute
punishment?
justice
o'connor
well,
has
this
court
specifically
held
that
a
second
conviction
with
a
concurrent
sentence
is
to
be
treated
as
punishment
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
o'connor
counsel,
i
take
it
you
take
the
position
then
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
just
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
at
all
of
double
convictions
as
opposed
to
punishments--
justice
o'connor
--when
they
are
handled
in
the
same
prosecution.
is
that
your
position?
justice
o'connor
all
right,
so
then
is
it
simply
a
matter
of
legislative
intent
whether
there
should
be
two
convictions?
justice
o'connor
is
that
what
we
would
look
to?
justice
o'connor
and
what
does
batchelder
tell
us
about
that,
in
your
view,
with
respect
to
these
two
statutes?
justice
o'connor
it
did
speak
in
terms
of
the
prosecution
making
a
choice,
however.
what
do
you
think
that
meant?
a
choice
for
purpose
of
prosecution
and
conviction,
or
only
for
sentencing?
