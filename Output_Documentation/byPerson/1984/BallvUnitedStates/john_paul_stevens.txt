justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
they
did
ask
to
have
one
of
the
sentences
vacated,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do
that.
it
made
it
run
concurrently,
but
it
didn't
vacate.
justice
stevens
so
then
isn't
the
issue
of
whether
the
second
sentence
should
be
vacated
something
we
rust
decide?
that
was
argued.
justice
stevens
they
ask
that
you
set
aside
the
conviction,
right.
justice
stevens
i
understand
that
she
asked
for
that,
but
it
is
true
that
she
also
makes
the
argument
that
the
second
sentence
on
which
he
is
on
probation
is
a
burden
that
would
be
set
aside
if
we
went
farther...
if
we
did
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
asked
to
do.
i
will
put
it
that
way.
justice
stevens
well,
do
you
think
that
putting
him
on
probation
on
the
second
sentence
complies
with
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
does
not?
justice
stevens
but
don't
you
think
in
kind
of
a
real
world
sense,
would
he
not
be
better
off
if
he
were
not
on
probation
on
the
second
sentence,
if
it
were
just
not
there?
is
it
not--
justice
stevens
--what
happens
when
probation
is
revoked?
does
he
just
serve
the
unexpired
portion
of
his
sentence,
or
doesn't
he
start
his
whole
sentence
from
scratch?
justice
stevens
if
that
happened
then
the
revocation
of
probation
would
cause
him
to
serve
a
longer
period
of
time
in
the
penitentiary
than
the
one
sentence.
justice
stevens
just
in
terms
of
the
practical
consequences
of
a
conviction,
we
had
a
case
argued
a
short
while
ago
where
a
man
on
his
employment
application
answered
no
to
whether
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
and
he
was
later
discharged
because
he
made
a
false
answer.
if
you
had
this
person
as
your
client,
and
he
was
asked
to
fill
out
an
employment
application,
how
many
times
he
had
been
convicted
of
felonies,
what
would
you
tell
him
to
do,
put
one
or
two?
justice
stevens
and
that
might
not
be...
that
would
not
be
prejudicial
at
all
to
him,
i
don't
suppose.
