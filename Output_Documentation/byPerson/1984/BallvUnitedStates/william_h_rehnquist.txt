justice
rehnquist
ms.
widener,
the
government
says
you
didn't
make
these
arguments
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
therefore
we
shouldn't
consider
them.
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
anyone
doubts
you
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
question
is,
what
arguments
did
you
make
to
that
court?
were
they
the
same
as
you
are
making
to
us?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
that
really
the
first
and
last
question?
i
mean,
blockburger
was
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
the
ultimate
question
in
a
case
like
this
is
just
the
one
you
meant.
did
congress
intend
to
cumulatively
punish
in
the
circumstance?
if
the
answer
is
yes,
the
other
blockburger
questions
are
just
irrelevant.
if
the
answer
is
no,
they
are
also
irrelevant.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
in
our
ohio
against
johnson
case,
last
spring,
i
thought
we
said
there
could
be
two
convictions
so
long
as
there
weren't
two
punishments.
justice
rehnquist
if
you
are
arguing
sentencing,
there
is
no
doubt,
at
least
in
my
mind,
that
you
are
correct,
but
to
say
that
the
conviction
as
well
amounts
to
a
punishment
i
think
is
more
debatable.
justice
rehnquist
perhaps
even
if
your
blockburger
analysis
is
right,
the
answer
is,
he
may
not
be
sentenced
on
both
convictions,
but
he
can
be
convicted
on
both
of
them,
and
in
that
case
your
argument
that
he
couldn't
convince
people
that
he
shouldn't
have
had
two
convictions
would
be
true
because
he
ought
not
to
be
able
to
convince
people
that
he
shouldn't
have
two
convictions.
justice
rehnquist
i
can
see
how
you
could
reimpose
a
sentence,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
could
reimpose
a
conviction
if
it
were
vacated.
i
would
think
that
would
take
a
new
trial.
justice
rehnquist
that
is
hardly
much
solace
to
the
government,
that
they
have
a
chance
to
try
the
person
again
for
something
which
he
has
already
been
convicted
of.
justice
rehnquist
that
is
a
different
problem.
you
could
also
get
into
a
situation
where
perhaps
one
section
of
the
statute
is
held
unconstitutional
at
some
later
date,
and
if
you
got
another
conviction
on
another
one
stockpiled,
you
could
pull
it
out
at
that
time.
justice
rehnquist
does
the
government
in
this
case
distinguish
between
conviction
and
sentence?
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you
understood
my
question,
at
least
gathering
from
the
way
you
are
answering.
i
asked
you
if
the
government
distinguishes
between
conviction
on
the
one
hand
and
sentence
on
the
other,
a
conviction
upon
which
no
sentence
is
imposed.
is
that
punishment?
a
judgment
of
conviction
returned,
but
there
was
no
sentence
imposed?
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
ever
get
to
the
question
of
whether
a
second
sentence
might
require
no
additional
time
in
prison.
if
there
is
no
sentence
at
all
imposed
on
the
conviction,
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
that
that
is
not
punishment.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
pincus,
in
the
light
of
your
answer
to
an
earlier
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
has
refined
the
position
it
has
taken
on
page
19
of
its
brief,
where
you
say,
"for
the
reasons
discussed
above,
a
rule
barring
entry
of
two
convictions
for
these
offenses
is
not
required.
"
"we
have
no
fundamental.
"
--what
you
mean
is
the
imposition
of
two
sentences.
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
you
have
no
objection
to
that?
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you
are
getting
the
distinction
between
conviction
and
sentence.
my
question
was
addressed
to
the
difference
between
convictions
and
sentences.
well,
go
on
to
something
else.
i
would
like
to
follow
up
on
that,
if
i
may.
you
seem
to
have
agreed
with
justice
white
that
you
had
no
objection
to
vacating
one
sentence,
leaving
the
conviction
standing,
refining
the
position
that
justice
rehnquist
indicated.
but
i
don't
understand
how
you
square
that
with
your
saying
what
really
is
at
issue
here
is
preserving
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
which
i
gather
hasn't
been
applied
since
1965
by
this
court
anyway.
that
is
what
we
are
fighting
about.
if
we
vacate
one
sentence,
you
are
not
preserving
your
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
and
you,
i
think,
said
that
is
perfectly
satisfactory
to
the
government.
yes,
but
you
would
agree
to
that,
i
take
it,
on
the
assumption
that
you
are
carrying
out
the
intent
of
congress.
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
any
event,
when
you
say
the
double
jeopardy
clause...
when
you
talk
about
multiple
punishments,
you
are
just
talking
about
legislative
intent,
aren't
you?
you
are
not
talking
about
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
in
alvernaz
and
missouri
against
hunter,
we
finally
dispelled
the
notion
that
there
was
a
double
jeopardy
inquiry
under
the
constitution,
where
you
are
talking
about
a
decision
on
the
part
of
the
legislative
body
to
impose
multiple
punishments
for
different
offenses.
that
is
strictly
a
statutory
question.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
why
do
you
refer
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
