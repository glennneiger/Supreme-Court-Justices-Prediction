chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
ball
against
united
states.
ms.
widener,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
they
are
really
arguing
a
sort
of
harmless
error
without
calling
it
that.
at
page
5
of
their
brief
they
make
a
statement
which
is
directly
contrary
to
the
one
you
have
just
told
us,
and
i
would
like
to
see
which
is
correct.
the
government
says
here,
the
additional
conviction
will
not
increase
the
defendant's
prison
term,
and
will
not
impose
any
other
adverse
consequence
upon
him.
now,
in
your
earlier
argument,
i
believe,
you
said
that
is
not
so.
chief
justice
burger
well,
we
will
wait
to
see
what
your
friend
has
to
say
about
that
when
his
turn
comes.
suppose
both
violations
are
charged
in
the
indictment,
and
the
case
is
tried
that
way,
and
it
goes
to
the
jury
on
both
charges,
and
he
is
convicted
on
both,
but
the
judge
then
says,
well,
he
has
been
convicted
on
both,
but
i
know
from
reading
the
supreme
court
cases,
at
least
the
way
i
read
them,
i
shouldn't
sentence
on
both,
so
i
am
going
to
impose
a
single
sentence
for
possession
or
for
receipt,
and
that
is
all
he
imposes.
would
you
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
burger
would
you
raise
your
voice
a
little,
mr.
pincus?
chief
justice
burger
yes.
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
why
doesn't
that
answer
the
question
here
that
has
been
posed
by
several
justices?
chief
justice
burger
no,
the
multiple
prosecution
for
the
same
conduct.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
concede
the
same
conduct
is
the
basis
of
each
of
the
charges?
chief
justice
burger
i
take
it...
excuse
me.
you
do
concede
there
are
two
sentences
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
widener?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
