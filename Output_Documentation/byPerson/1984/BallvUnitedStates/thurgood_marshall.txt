justice
marshall
mr.
pincus,
your
brief
on
page
19,
the
fourth
paragraph,
gets
me...
do
you
still
agree
with
that
language,
that
you
don't
object
to
this,
that
you
don't
object
to
the
plan
that
the
petitioner
has
put
forth?
justice
marshall
well,
you
agree
this
is
additional
punishment?
justice
marshall
mr.
pincus,
what
about
the
recidivist
statutes?
justice
marshall
under
a
recidivist
statute,
if
you
had
two
convictions,
you
go.
if
you
only
have
one,
you
don't
go.
justice
marshall
you
wouldn't
consider
that
punishment?
justice
marshall
does
that
cover
all
recidivist
statutes?
i
think
i
have
seen
them
that
don't
have
that
in
them.
justice
marshall
i
didn't
think
so.
so
on
those
it
does
not
cover,
he
has
a
problem.
yes
or
no?
