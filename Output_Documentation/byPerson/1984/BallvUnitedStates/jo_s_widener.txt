ms.
jo
s.
widener
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
here
this
morning
on
behalf
of
truman
lewis
ball
to
ask
the
court
to
vacate
one
of
his
convictions
and
one
of
his
sentences
under
the
cases
of
united
states
against
batchelder
and
blockburger
against
the
united
states.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
two
convictions
suffered
by
mr.
ball,
one
for
922,
receipt
by
a
convicted
felon
of
a
firearm,
and
1202,
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
convicted
felon.
the
government
proved
three
incidences
of
possession
in
this
case,
all
of
which
occurred
at
or
about
the
same
time.
the
first
was
when
truman
ball
reached
into
a
bag
of
beer
and
came
out
with
that
gun.
the
second
was
when
he
had
the
gun
in
clarence
music's
yard
and
waved
it
at
him.
the
third
was
when
they
arrested
him,
when
the
police
officers
arrested
him
at
gary
music's
house
and
saw
the
gun
in
his
back
pocket.
there
are
a
few
other
critical
facts
to
this
case
as
well.
mr.
ball
is
now
in
prison,
where
he
has
been
for
the
last
15
months.
he
is
serving
a
three-year
sentence
on
the
922
receipt.
at
the
same
time,
he
is
on
probation
for
the
1202
conviction.
he
has
two
years'
probation,
and
he
is
fully
subject
to
the
conditions
of
that
probation
at
the
time
that
he
is
in
prison
now
serving
those
three
years.
this
is
under
the
case
of
burns
against
the
united
states,
which
is
a
case
we
have
not
cited
in
our
brief.
the
citation
to
it
is
287
us
216.
any
time
between
now
and
the
next
nine
months,
if
mr.
ball
should
get
into
any
sort
of
confrontation
there
in
the
prison
or
any
trouble
at
all,
if
he
should
infringe
upon
any
prison
regulation
at
all,
he
is
subject
to
having
his
probation
revoked.
at
whatever
time
he
has
that
probation
revoked,
he
is
then
subject
to
having
an
extra
two
years
imposed
upon
him,
two
years
that
he
will
have
to
serve.
that,
of
course,
will
be
concurrent
with
the
sentence
that
he
is
now
serving,
but
it
will
still
mean
to
him
that
after
he
has
served
his
three
years
on
the
922
offense,
he
will
yet
have
one
more
year
or
at
least
up
to
one
more
year,
somewhere
between
three
months
and
one
year,
of
a
sentence
to
serve
because
of
the
1202
concurrent
sentence
that
is
now
imposed
upon
him.
in
other
words,
he
is
worse
off
today
because
he
has
a
probation
to
serve
than
he
would
be
if
he
simply
had
two
years
to
serve
on
that
sentence
and
it
was
running
concurrently,
because
if
he
had
two
years
to
serve,
it
would
be
over
in
two
years.
however,
now
we
have
no
certainty
that
it
will
be
over
in
two
years,
and
we
have
no
certainty
for
the
next
nine
months.
we
say
that
this
is
not
an
adverse
collateral
consequence
of
this
concurrent
sentence.
we
say
that
this
is
a
direct,
immediate
consequent
to
mr.
ball
that
he
is
suffering
under
today,
and
therefore
this
case
ought
to
be
reviewed.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
your
honor,
we
would
argue
that
we
did
make
these
arguments.
we
asked
for
both
the
conviction
and
sentence
to
be
vacated.
that
was
the
opening
sentence
in
our
brief,
and
we
also
asked
in
our
notice
of
appeal
that...
our
notice
of
appeal
was
taken
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
including
the
finding
of
guilty
and
also
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
upon
each
of
these...
on
each
of
these
two
convictions.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
yes,
your
honor,
they
were
exactly
the
same
as
we
are
making
hare.
the
only
difference
is,
we
left
out
the
two
words
"and
convictions",
and
the
reason
we
did
that
was
because
under
the
burton
case
we
suffered
some
great
danger
that
we
would
not
be
heard
at
all,
as
burton
had
not
been
heard
on
his
direct
appeal.
nevertheless
our
arguments
here
are
exactly
the
same.
we
are
still
arguing
blockburger
and
we
are
still
arguing
batchelder,
which
we
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
batchelder
case
we
did
not
argue
specifically
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
this
was
because
we
were
faced
with
the
burton
construction
of
the
batchelder
case.
burton
had
already
decided
what
batchelder
meant
for
the
fourth
circuit,
so
we
were
locked
into
that.
the
facts
here
are
indistinguishable
from
the
case
of
batchelder.
there
a
convincted
felon
bought
a
gun
from
an
atf
agent
while
mr.
batchelder
was
tending
bar
in
bellview,
illinois.
when
he...
and
the
court
said
in
batchelder
that
when
mr.
batchelder
reached
across
that
bar
and
took
that
gun
from
the
atf
agent,
at
that
moment
he
was
guilty
of
both.
he
was
guilty
of
922,
receipt,
and
he
was
guilty
of
1202
just
by
that
single
act.
here
we
have
the
exact
same
facts.
when
mr.
ball
reached
into
that
bag
of
beer,
he
was
guilty
of
both
receipt
and
possession
by
that
act,
and
batchelder
said
that
congress
had
intended
in
passing
these
two
statutes
to
have
two
independent
statutes
each
fully
enforceable
on
their
own
terms,
and
batchelder
also
confirmed
that
this
very
conduct
violated
both
statutes.
when
a
single
act
violates
two
statutes,
as
we
have
in
this
case,
we
look
to...
the
courts
always
look
to
the
case
of
blockburger
against
the
united
states
to
determine
whether
there
is
one
offense
or
whether
there
are
two
offenses.
the
first
question
to
ask
under
the
blockburger
analysis
is,
did
congress
intend
to
cumulatively
punish
for
this
offense?
ms.
jo
s.
widener
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
true.
blockburger
is
a
statutory
construction,
but
there
are
some...
there
is
sort
of
a
procedure
to
go
through
under
blockburger.
the
first
is
to
look
at
the
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history,
to
see
what
can
be
gleaned
there,
and
if
there
is
no
clear
intent
indicated
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
statute
itself,
then
one
resorts
to
the
test
of
blockburger
to
determine
what
congress's
intent
was
in
passing
those
two
statutes.
so,
yes,
you
are
correct,
as
i
understand
it,
that
it
is
a
statutory
construction
problem.
the
circuits...
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
this
question,
all
except
the
tenth
circuit
say
that
there
is...
there
was
no
cumulative
punishment
intended
by
congress
when
they
passed
these
two
statutes.
when
i
say
all
of
those
circuits
that
have
considered
it,
that
means
the
third,
the
fifth,
the
seventh,
the
ninth,
the
d.c.
circuit,
and
the
fourth
circuit.
these
circuits
base
their
analysis,
all
except
the
third,
which
is
underneath
a
case
which
the
government
conceded,
but
the
other
circuits
all
base
their
analysis
on
the
batchelder
case,
where
the
court
in
batchelder
had
said
that
the
government
could
prosecute
on
either.
the
circuits
then
interpreted
this
to
mean
that
the
government
could
not
prosecute
all
the
way
to
judgment,
to
conviction,
to
sentence
on
both
of
those
statutes
at
the
same
time.
these
same
circuits
say
when
the
government
has
not
chosen
either
one
or
the
other
but
has
chosen
instead
to
proceed
on
both
statutes,
that
the
remedy
there
is
to
vacate
one
conviction
and
one
sentence.
this
is
all
except
the
fourth
circuit,
of
course.
the
fourth
circuit
says
that
the
remedy
is
to
make
the
sentences
run
concurrently.
but
even
if
the
circuits'
reasoning
is
wrong
under
batchelder,
still
looking
to
the
statutes
themselves
and
to
the
congressional
history,
there
is
no
explicit
clear
statement
in
any
of
that
indicating
that
congress
intended
to
cumulatively
punish
under
these
statutes,
and
the
most
recent
case
of
missouri
against
hunter
teaches
us
what
kind
of
language
should
be
there
if,
or
we
should
look
for
to
determine
that
intent,
language
such
as
"in
addition
to".
there
is
no
such
language
in
either
of
these
statutes.
in
the
absence
of--
ms.
jo
s.
widener
--yes,
your
honor,
we
say
that
conviction
alone
does
constitute
punishment.
in
this
case,
mr.
ball's
two
convictions
can
be
used
subsequently
if
he
should
get
into
any
other
trouble
and
have
to
ever
be
on
the
witness
stand
again,
those
two
convictions
can
be
used
to
impeach
his
credibility.
those
two
convictions
could
possibly
be
used
against
him
in
a
recidivist
situation.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
your
honor,
i
could
find
no
specific
holding
as
to
that
effect.
nevertheless,
when
i
looked
back
through
the
cases,
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
all
cases
except
for
the
line
of
cases
under
prince,
that
the
remedy
when
there
is
a
double
jeopardy
question
has
been
to
reverse
the
judgment
or
to
vacate
the
conviction.
always
the
entire
judgment
was
considered,
and
not
just
the
vacating
of
the
sentence,
as
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
here.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
your
honor,
we
would
argue
that
a
second
conviction
in
this
case
is
an
additional
punishment
on
mr.
ball,
and
because
of
the
effect
of
his
concurrent
sentence
here,
he
is
also
suffering
additional
punishment,
and
very
realistically
may
suffer
an
extra
year
on
his
punishment.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
i
think
that
under
the
cases
of
sylburn
against
ohio
and
street
and
that
line
of
cases
in
which
the
court
looked
to
whether
or
not
there
were
adverse
legal
consequences
of
convictions,
i
believe
the
court
has
said
that
these
consequences
do
exist,
and
in
this
case,
this
man
is
a
man
who
is
not
well
educated.
he
is
not
someone
who
can
defend
himself
from
these
convictions
and
from
the
effect
that
they
are
going
to
have
on
his
life.
they
will
affect
him
in
his
employment
situation.
they
will
affect
him
every
time
he
is
put
on
the
witness
stand.
he
in
a
further
prosecution...
it
is
unrealistic
to
suggest
that
he,
pitted
against
a
well
educated
and
well
trained
prosecutor,
could
possibly
convince
a
jury
that
these
two...
that
he
should
not
have
two
convictions
here,
that
he
should
only
have
one
conviction.
nor
could
he
convince
a
sentencing
judge
in
the
future
that
he
should
not
have
two
convictions
here,
he
should
simply
have
one,
because
the
very
fact
of
those
two
convictions
existing
on
that
paper
seem
to
indicate
to
a
judge
that
he
is
guilty
of
both.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
well,
your
honor,
i
would,
i
guess,
fall
back
on
the
argument
that
since
congress
has
not
told
us
specifically
what
to
do
in
this
situation,
it
has
not
told
us
when
this
conduct
violates
those
two
statutes,
whether
we
should
convict
or
sentence
under
both.
we
do
know,
however,
that
it
has
not
authorized
two
convictions
for
either
of
these
statutes.
the
only
punishment
that
it
has
authorized
here
is
a
conviction
and
punishment
under
either
of
those
statutes.
i
do
not
believe
that
without
a
clear
statement
that
more
than
one
statute
is
violated
or
what
to
do
in
the
case
when
more
than
one
statute
is
violated,
that
you
could
impose
an
extra
punishment
on
him
which
in
this
case
his
conviction
would
be
an
extra
punishment.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
not
so.
he
is
subject
to
not
only
a
sentence
of
three
years
that
he
is
serving
right
now,
but
under
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
when
they
made
these
sentences
run
concurrently,
he
is
also
subject
to
the
terms
of
his
probation
right
now.
so
that
in
addition
to
his
three-year
sentence,
should
for
any
reason,
and
of
course
prison
is
not
a
place
where
you
are
not
easily
to
bump
into
someone
else
and
get
into
some
sort
of
trouble,
if
in
the
next
nine
months
he
should
get
into
any
small
infraction
of
prison
regulations,
he
would
then
be
subject
not
only
to
whatever
penalty
they
would
enforce
upon
him
for
doing
that
in
the
prison,
but
he
would
also
be
subject
to
having
his...
to
being
called
back
before
judge
williams
in
the
district
court
and
having
his
two-year
probation,
which
he
is
now
serving,
having
that
revoked,
and--
ms.
jo
s.
widener
--well,
i
certainly
should
have,
your
honor,
because
we
do
argue
that
these
convictions
themselves
were
a
problem.
the
reason
that
it
could
not
be
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
jo
s.
widener
--but
your
honor,
there
is
a
real--
ms.
jo
s.
widener
--i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
jo
s.
widener
no,
we
are
not
arguing
that.
it
does
not
affect
our
position
one
way
or
the
other
whether
they--
ms.
jo
s.
widener
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
under
melanovich,
or
indeed,
if
he
does
not
instruct
the
jury
that
way,
he
should
not
allow
two
convictions
to
be
imposed
on
these
two
statutes.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
anywhere
that
would
indicate
that
when
the
same
conduct
violates
those
two
statutes,
he
should
be
convicted
under
both
because
of
the
adverse
consequence
of
that
extra
conviction,
that
it
is
something
that
is
going
to
follow
him
around
forever.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
convictions
will
have,
because
of
the
concept
of
recidivism
statutes,
where
he
now
under
this
record
has
at
least
his
third
conviction
because
of
this
excessive
conviction.
therefore
in
many
states
he
would
be
subject
as
of
this
moment
to
ten
years.
in
some
states
it
is
a
life
sentence
for
the
third
offense.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
well,
your
honor--
ms.
jo
s.
widener
--well,
certainly
under
these
facts
it
is
true
in
this
particular
case.
of
course,
if
a
man
had
a
death
sentence
and
a
concurrent
sentence,
that
would
not
be
true.
then
it
may
not
be
a
rule
that
should
be
implied.
the
d.c.
circuit
has
an
interesting
way
of
applying
the
concurrent
sentence
rule.
they
determine
that
if,
in
order
to
promote
judicial
economy
and
not
to
have
to
consider
a
sentence,
they
look
at
the
two
interests
involved.
since
there
is
no
interest
that
the
government
actually
has
to
protect,
and
the
government
here
has
conceded
that
in
their
brief,
that
they
really
have
no
fundamental
objection
to
this
rule
that
we
are
talking
about
right
now.
since
the
government
has
no
interest
to
protect,
and
since
the
possible
adverse
legal
consequences
to
the
defendant
are
very
real
to
him,
the
d.c.
circuit,
without
review,
vacates
these
sentences
and
convictions
on
the
theory
that
they
could
be
reimposed
at
some
later
time
if
it
was
shown,
for
example,
that
the
first
sentence
was
reversed
on
appeal.
of
course,
if
the
first
sentence
was
reversed
on
appeal,
and
they
look
at
the
second
sentence
here,
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
prosecutor
from
reprosecuting
under
that
first
sentence
at
that
point.
ms.
jo
s.
widener
yes,
your
honor,
that's
what
i
mean.
a
new
trial
could
be
taken.
this
is
the
d.c.--
ms.
jo
s.
widener
--of
course,
in
most
situations
that
is
not
going
to
arise,
however,
because
the
court
under
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
determines
one
sentence
is
valid
before
they
determine
not
to
look
at
the
other
sentence,
so
the
chance
of
having
the
first
sentence
that
has
already
been
determined
to
be
valid
reversed
is
very
minimal.
and
that
is
why
i
would
take
issue
with
the
d.c.'s
policy
there,
because
if
there
was
ever
any
time
to
have
to
reimpose
that
second
sentence
that
they
vacated,
of
course,
that
could
be
done
by
retrial,
but
it
is
a
very
slim
possibility.
since
i
am
beginning
to
eat
into
my
rebuttal
time,
i
think
that
i
will
try
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.

just
a
few
things,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
has
no
application
here
at
all.
blockburger
says
that
for
a
single
offense
there
should
be
a
single
sentence.
a
concurrent
sentence
is
an
improper
remedy
to
impose.
therefore,
this
case
really
has
no
effect
on
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
at
all,
because
this
is
an
improper
remedy
under
blockburger.
the
government
has
conceded
that
there
is
a
single
offense
here.
they
conceded
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
taylor
that
there
should
only
be
single
sentence
imposed
here.
in
united
states
against
martin
in
the
seventh
circuit,
they
conceded
that
their
should
only
be
a
single
conviction.
we
would
ask
the
court
thus
to
vacate
petitioner's
sentence
and
conviction.
