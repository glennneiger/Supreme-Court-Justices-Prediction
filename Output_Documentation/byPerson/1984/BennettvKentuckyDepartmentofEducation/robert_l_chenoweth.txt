mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
federal-state
grant
program
case
involving
title
i
funds,
the
secretary
of
education
wants
retroactive
application
of
his
interpretation
of
the
law
on
supplanting.
to
agree
with
the
secretary's
position
would
be
to
allow
him
to
use
his
interpretation
of
the
law
retroactively
to
achieve
a
recoupment
of
title
i
funds
that
have
already
been
expended
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky.
such
a
penalty
should
not
be
imposed
where
kentucky
acted
in
good
faith,
on
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
title
i
law,
and
when
there
had
not
been
adequate
notice
of
the
obligations
under
the
title
i
provision
to
the
commonwealth.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor,
yes
we
are
saying
that
they
are
and
that
they
were
ambiguous.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
think
that
is
a
very,
very
fair
question,
but
the
important
point
concerning
that
is
that
you
truly
have
to
believe
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
your
program,
something
wrong
with
the
way
that
you
are
using
the
law
and
getting
the
funds.
you
don't--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--yes,
your
honor,
we
very
much
agree
with
that,
but
the
point,
while
not
being
in
the
abstract,
is
also
that
we
are
simply
not
only
looking
at
what
we
believe
to
be
facial
ambiguity
of
this
law,
but
really
perhaps
more
importantly
than
the
facial
ambiguity,
what
is
meant
by
supplant,
what
is
meant
by
supplementing
as
seen
in
that
law.
we
are
not
looking
at
just
the
facial
ambiguity,
but
we
are
also
looking
at
the
ambiguity
as
applied,
as
those
words
were
applied,
and
as
seen
by
the
secretary
of
education.
we
believe
that
it
is
a
both
level
of
ambiguity
that
was
evident
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
the
details
of
the
program
as
such
were
not
set
out
in
that
application.
it
is
very
important
to
understand,
justice
brennan,
that
when
congress
enacted
this
law
in
1965,
specifically
in
the
law
there
is
the
intention
of
congress
of
having
the
programs
that
were
going
to
benefit
these
educationally
deprived
children
developed
by
the
states.
they
were
intended
to
be
innovative.
the
design
was
going
to
be
left
for
the
states
to
come
up
with
on
the
belief
that
the
way
kentucky
dealt
with
this
problem
would
be
different
than
the
way
it
would
be
dealt
with
in
another
state.
so
there
was
no
a
requirement
or
an
expectation
that
in
the
receiving
of
those
title
i
funds
that
you
were
going
to
establish
at
that
very
point
exactly
the
nature
of
the
program.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
looking
at
this
case
very
much
relied
upon
the
bell
v.
new
jersey
decision
and
the
1981
decision
in
pennhurst
of
this
court.
the
pennhurst
decision
is
applicable
in
this
case
because
title
i
is
a
grant
in
aid
program,
and
it
is
based
upon
the
concept
of
cooperative
federalism.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor,
i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
but
while
the
words
"supplant"
are
in
the
law,
and
kentucky
knew
that
that
was
in
the
law,
it
is
not
just
simply
that
that
condition
was
in
the
law,
it
is
how
that
condition
was
applied,
and
therein
is
the
similarity
between
this
case
and
pennhurst
because
we
had
not
in
the
commonwealth
been
given
adequate
notification
as
to
what
that--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--well,
your
honor,
we
do
believe,
and
it
is
clear
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
court
was
believing
that
kentucky
had
not
had
adequate
notice
of
its
obligations
in
the
same
sense
as
this
court
addressed
that
in
pennhurst.
again--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--your
honor,
we
do--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
justice
o'connor,
we
believe
that
in
that
provision
of
the
law
that
you
are
reading,
not
only
does
it
talk
about
children,
which
is
a
collective
reference,
first
of
all--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--the
provision
of
the
law
while,
and
the
regulation
while
talking
about
pupils,
it
also
is
talking
about
project
area.
we
go
back
and
we
look
at
what
was
meant
by
supplanting,
what
has
been
looked
at
as
supplanting
from
the
very
beginning,
and
we
understand
from
virtually
the
beginning
of
the
title
i
law
that
the
expenditure
of
the
federal
dollars
for
programs
that
had
previously
been
paid
for
by
state
money,
the
type
of
situation
with
the
enrichment
types
of
programs
that
we
had
as
a
part
of
our
readiness
program
that
was
paid
for
with
state
money,
previously
early
practice,
pre-1970
practice
would
have
been
that
those
kinds
of
services
would
have
been
paid
for
by
federal
funds.
kentucky
understood
that
those
kinds
of
services
could
not
be
paid
for
with
the
federal
funds.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor,
simply
pointing
to
that,
i
cannot
point
to
the
provision.
the
point
though
is,
one,
it
is
not
just
facial
ambiguity
that
i
think
that
we
have
to
consider.
we
need
to
look
at
the
context
in
which
this
program
was
being
operated.
we
need
to
look
at
the
manner
of
application.
part
of
the
divergent
interpretations
involved
in
this
case
came
from
the
perspective
of
whether
you
accept
that
the
supplanting
issues
are
to
be
monitored
at
the
level
of
the
child
or
whether
you
are
going
to
monitor
the
expenditure
of
money
at
the
school
district
or
at
the
classroom
level.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor,
we
believe
that
it
also
is
talking
about
the
project
area,
and
that
you
look
at
those
together.
i
think,
though,
importantly,
that
we...
what
we
need
to
zero
in
on
is
not
really
the
interpretations
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
because
it
is
not
a
matter
of
choosing
between
those
interpretations.
the
question
here
is
what
kentucky
understood
the
commitments
under
that
title
i
contract
to
be.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
an
estoppel
matter
any
more
than
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
indicated
it
to
be.
we
think
that
there
are
significant
differences
between
this
case
and
the
crawford
community
services
case,
the
heckler
case.
one,
that
was
not
a
spending
power
case,
it
was
a
private
party
that
was
receiving
these
funds,
and
there
was
certainly
a
very
questionable
interpretation
upon
the
law
that
was
involved
in
that
case.
so
we
don't
see
that
what
we
are
having
to
focus
in
on
in
this
title
i
case
as
being
an
estoppel
case
or
a
heckler
case
at
all.
again,
we
believe
that
the
pertinent
question
that
has
to
be
addressed
is
what
were
the
understandings
of
the
commitments
under
that
title
i
contract,
the
contract
that
is
in
place
because
title
i
is
a
spending
power
clause
provision
of
the
federal
constitution,
and
it
is
very
much
in
the
nature
of
a
contract.
there
has
to
be
a
meeting
of
the
minds
of
we
are
going
to
have
a
good
contract.
and
we
believe
that
it
is
clear
that
there
was
not
a
meeting
of
the
minds
here
as
to
what
kentucky's
obligations
were
going
to
be
under
that
title
i
provision.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--your
honor,
we
found
that
out
really
as
the
audit
was
being
completed
in
1974.
the
audit
period
was
1967
to
1974.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--it
was
not
a
matter
that
at
that
time--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--it
was
not
ambiguous.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor,
the
ambiguity--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--your
honor,
the
answer
to
that,
and
the
only
answer
that
i
can
give
to
you
is
that
it
was
not
at
a
particular
point
in
time.
we
did
not
believe--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--there's...
there's
no
way
really
to
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
certainly
that's
true.
the
point
that
we
have
to
consider
is
that
we
had
these
programs
developed
before
the
1970
supplanting
provision.
we
continued
on
with
those
programs
for
six
years.
we
had
encouraged
other
school
districts
to
develop
those
programs.
we
thought
that
they
were
a
showcase
program,
that
they
were
a
good
example
of
a
design
by
a
state
to
serve
the
intent
and
purposes
of
congress.
you
don't
ask
what
is
wrong
with
the
law
unless
you
believe
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
what
you
are
doing
under
the
law.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor,
we
found
out
that
was
so
in
the
sense
we
were
told
after
the
audit
that
what
our
program
had
been
doing
and
the
manner
in
which
that
program
had
been
developed,
that
there
was
a
problem
with
the
law
as
seen
by
the
auditors.
so
at
that
point
in
time
certainly
we
did
become
aware
that
our
education
staff
had
not
looked
at
this
law
at
the
same
level
of
monitoring
as
had
the
state
or
the
federal
education
officials.
so
yes,
it
was
brought
to
our
mind
then.
but
we
did
not
have,
and
our
education
people
did
not
have
a
question
from
the
very
beginning
that
this
was
a
problem.
again,
there
would
have
been
no
incentive...
if
we
thought
that
there
was
a
problem
and
we
were
unsure
of
that,
there
was
no
incentive
to
continue
on
with
this
program.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
but
this
is...
that
was
after
the
fact,
your
honor.
that
was
after
the
audit
exception--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--your
honor,
the
important
point
that
we
are
trying
to
make
here
is
that
we
believe
we
had
a
program
that
was
consistent
with
the
law,
and
that
we
do
believe
that
there
is
considerable
moment
in
the
fact
that
there
were
operational
review
teams
that
did
come
in
on
a
yearly
basis
to
kentucky.
those
operational
people
from
the
federal
office
of
education
went
out
to
the
school
districts.
they
saw
these
programs
in
effect.
and
the
record
is
clear
that
the
directors
of
the
title
i
wanted
to
show
off
this
program.
now,
the
comment
and
the
response
on
this
as
to,
well,
we
didn't
look
at
the
funding.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
really
cannot
be
the
answer.
that
was
exactly
what
the
operational
team
had
to
look
at
was
whether
or
not
these
programs
were
complying
with
the
law
on
the
expenditure
of
that
money.
that
was
their
only
purpose
for
looking
at
the
program.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor,
we
are
not
arguing
estoppel.
we
are
not
arguing
that
at
all,
but
we
do
believe
that
the
sixth
circuit
did
look
at
a
coalition
of
factors
in
looking
at
this
request
to
apply
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
what
was
prohibited
by
supplanting,
and
one
of
those
factors
is
kentucky's
good
faith,
and
that
is
very
much
shown
in
the
record,
that
kentucky
did
attempt
to
follow
this
law
in
good
faith.
we--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--yes,
we
believe
that
is
a
different
question,
but
also
is
a
part
of
the
consideration
of
the
design
of
that
program.
kentucky
as
well
as
other
states
were
attempting
to
create
innovative
ways
to
meet
the
needs
of
these
educationally
deprived
children.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
not
alone,
your
honor,
but
we
do
believe
importantly
in
looking
at
the
way
the
sixth
circuit
in
reviewing
this
issue
which
we
believe
is
the
pertinent
issue,
and
that
is
what
the
understanding
of
the
commitments
were
by
kentucky
in
the
receipt
of
those
title
i
funds,
that
that
was
a
factor,
that
kentucky
had
had
the
operational
people
in
looking
at
the
design,
and
they
had
not
been
told
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
those
programs,
and
we
believe
that
was
a
part
of
the
good
faith
of
the
commonwealth
concerning
these
self-contained
readiness
programs.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
as
a
pure
contract
theory,
no,
we
would
agree
with
that,
justice
o'connor.
but
again,
we
are
looking
at
a
contract
here
in
the
nature
of
a
grant
in
aid
program,
in
the
nature
of
the
cooperative
federalism
where
the
state
is
giving
up
something,
giving
up
rights
that
it
has
in
order
to
enter
into
that
cooperation
with
the
federal
government.
we
believe
that
in
order
to
do
that...
and
we
did
think
consistent
with
pennhurst,
and
that
pennhurst
is
very
much
applicable
in
this
case,
as
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
believed,
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
that
giving
up,
then
there
is
going
to
have
to
be
a
clear
understanding
of
what
it
is
that
the
state
is
giving
up.
to
that
extent,
we
do
believe
that
the
court's
consideration
that
there
had
not
been
any
finding
of
bad
faith
is
very
much
a
part
of
the
standard
of
review
that
the
courts
of
appeals
are
to
exercise
pursuant
to
this
court's
decision
in
bell
v.
new
jersey
when
you
are
looking
at
a
recoupment
of
title
i
funds.
again,
you
don'
go
into
a
program,
and
if
you
have
reservations
of
that
program,
start
encouraging
other
school
districts
within
the
state
to
develop
those
programs.
we
had
in
1974,
when
again
that
audit
signalled
to
us
that
there
were
problems,
by
that
time
we
had
69
school
districts
that
had
readiness
programs.
that's
a
third
of
the
kentucky
school
districts.
importantly
also,
we
believe,
is
the
fact
that
there
were
not
any
incentives
any
the
state
or
the
local
districts
to
keep
doing
this.
we
were
not
saving
any
money.
there
were
the
same
amount
of
money,
as
indicated
by
justice
stevens,
we
had
the
same
amount
of
money
going
to
those
school
districts,
we
had
the
same
number
of
teachers.
so
that
the
only
incentive
that
possibly
could
have
been
available
to
the
state,
to
the
local
districts,
had
to
be
a
belief
that
those
programs
were
serving
the
intent
and
purpose
of
having
title
i
programs
and
the
receipt
of
that
federal
money.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor,
we
are
not
saying
that
any
of
these
matters
as
a
sole
factor
show
the
point.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
obviously
a
different
situation,
and
yes,
that
would
be
supplanting--
but
here
we
were
not
doing
that.
the
benefit
that
was
derived
from
having
these
self-contained
readiness
programs
was
a
matter
that
was
agreed
and
conceded
in
the
administrative
proceedings.
it
was
a
matter
that
was
made
reference
to
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
to
the
fact
that
when
the
auditors
made
the
exception,
they
made
the
exception
only
for
the
children
that
were
going
to
be
promoted
and
not
for
those
children
that
were
going
to
be
held
back.
we
believe
that
that
tends
to
indicate
that
there
were
differing
levels
of
understanding
even
by
the
auditors
and
the
education
appeals
board
as
to
what
was
meant
by
supplanting,
and
that
it
was
not
just
our
perhaps
reading
of
the
law,
but
it
was
also
the
reading
of
the
law
by
others.
that
ambiguity
that
we
do
believe
existed
both
facially
and
application,
can
be
seen
in
the
fact
that,
one,
it
is
in
the
nie
report
that
there
was
a
lack
of
clarity
in
the
issue
of
supplanting.
this
ambiguity,
the
unclearness
of
the
understanding
as
to
what
was
supplanting,
existed
even
after
1977,
or
1974.
it
went
on
even
through
1977,
and
that
again
is
in
the
nie
report
that
that
had
been
very
much
an
issue
in
the
office
of
education
between
various
members
of
that
office.
so
we
have
a
continuation
even
past
the
period
of
our
audit
when
there
was
still
some
problems
as
to
what
was
meant
by
supplanting.
the
supplanting
statute
certainly
stated
a
goal,
but
we
argue
that
it
did
not
explain
how
that
goal
was
going
to
be
achieved
and
was
going
to
be
gained,
and
we
do
believe
that
when
you
look
at
the
language
and
look
at
the
manner
in
which
that
is
applied,
look
at
the
different
kind
of
indicators
that
are
going
to
have
an
important
play
upon
what
is
meant
by
supplanting,
again,
whether
you
look
at
that
as
the
secretary
would
like,
at
the
pupil,
whether
you
look
at
that
in
the
pupil
and
also
the
classroom,
the
school
district,
those
indicators,
are
you
going
to
look
at
it
simply
money,
or
are
you
going
to
look
at
it
benefit?
the
secretary
must
have
looked
at
it
not
only
in
terms
of
money;
he
had
to
have
looked
at
it
in
the
sense
of
benefit,
a
benefit
supplement
because
he
reduced
it
merely
on
the
fact
that
we
had
the
lower
student-teacher
ratio.
that
didn't
change
the
dollars
approach
to
it
at
all,
but
still
gave
us
a
modification
of
the
amount
of
money
on
the
basis
of
the
benefit.
so
two
levels
are
existent,
even
through
the
proceedings
of
this
case
over
six
or
seven
years.
the
third
factor
that
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
looked
at
in
applying
the
proper
legal
standards,
again
as
it
was
supposed
to
do,
and
looking
at
this
case
in
the
sense
of
pennhurst,
and
looking
at
it
in
the
sense
of
the
significant
issue
that
was
identified
in
justice
white's
concurring
opinion
in
bell
v.
new
jersey,
and
that
is
whether
the
state
should
be
held
liable
in
a
recoupment
action,
in
a
post-audit
recoupment
action
if
there
was
merely
a
technical
violation
or
if
there
was
a
different
construction
of
the
statute
after
the
state
had
had
their
plan
submitted
and
approved--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
a
change
in
the
construction.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
we
believe
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
construction--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--well,
there
was
not
an
explanation
of
what
the
construction
of
the
supplanting
law
was--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--yes,
your
honor,
and
we
believe
that--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--well,
it
certainly
is
a
change
from
what
kentucky--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--yes,
and
we
think
that
that's
very
important.
again,
not
the
least
by
which
we
had
these
people
in
looking
at
the
way
that
we
were
doing
things
and
then
later
told
that
the
way
we
were
doing
things
was
not
in
compliance
with
the
law.
we
think
that
change
in
construction
or
the
notification
of
the
construction
of
the
law
on
supplanting
is
a
factor
and
is
a
part
of
what
the
sixth
circuit
was
obliged
to
do
in
the
reviewing
of
this
recoupment
consideration
in
title
i.
certainly
the
retroactive,
post-audit
recoupment
of
title
i
funds
as
desired
by
the
secretary
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
consensual
nature
of
a
grant
program,
like
title
i
is,
where
a
state
ought
to...
it
really
has
to
be
able
to
weigh
what
the
benefits
and
the
burdens
are.
the
secretary's
desire
to
have
his
interpretations
applied
retroactively
is
not
in
keeping,
we
believe,
not
only
with
the
pennhurst
decision,
but
is
not
in
keeping
with
the
rosato
v.
wyman
approach.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
we
do
not
believe
that
the
interpretation
that
has
been
placed
upon
them
by
the
secretary
in
this
decision--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--in
the
abstract,
justice
o'connor,
the
pertinent
question
still
has
to
be
what
did
kentucky
understand
its
commitments
to
be
under
this
contract?
while
we
are
fully
willing
to
allow
the
case
to
follow
this
case,
the
new
jersey
case,
be
argued
by
the
able
counsel
for
those
parties,
i
can't
help
but
inject
that
in
that
case,
the
secretary,
where
the
secretary
does
not
want
a
retroactivity
of
the
education
law,
the
contention
is
that
the
point
of
reference
must
be
whether
the
state
complied
with
its
title
i
commitments
as
they
were
understood
at
the
time.
that
is
a
contemporaneous
understanding
perspective,
and
that
is
what
we
are
contending
is
and
should
be
applicable
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
to
apply
the
secretary's
interpretation
retroactively
would
create
a
manifest
injustice.
we
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
matters
looked
at
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
that
there
should
not
be
a
retroactive,
post-audit
recoupment
of
title
i
funds.
the
standard
of
review
the
sixth
circuit
set
out
is
simply
one
that
protects
a
state
in
a
grant
program
from
retroactive
liability
where
the
state
has
applied
in
good
faith--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
secretary
is
applying
a
construction
of
the
statute
and
his
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
the
level
by
which
that
was
going
to
be
considered,
he
is
applying
that
retroactively,
and
only
by
doing
that
could
there
be
a
recoupment
of
the
expended
title
i
funds.
so
we
are
arguing,
we
believe
that
the
facts
show
that
it
is
a
retroactive
application
of
that.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
your
honor,
but
a
part
of
that
is
going
to
be
that
kentucky
had
a
notice
of
what
those
obligations
were
going
to
be,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
kentucky
did
not
have
adequate
notice
of
those
obligations
in
keeping
with
pennhurst,
and
that
therefore
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
have
this
recoupment
of
already-expended
title
i
dollars
that
would
have
to
be
paid
for
out
of
kentucky
general
tax
dollars.
we
believe
that
is
the...
that
in
order
to
apply
the
proper
legal
standards
which
we
think
the
sixth
circuit
did,
and
the
considerations
in
the
application
of
pennhurst,
that
the...
there
cannot
be
that
recoupment
of
monies.
we
submit
to
your
honors,
that
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
should
be
affirmed.
