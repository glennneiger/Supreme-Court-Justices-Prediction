justice
white
--well
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
first
place,
then,
in
asking
for
so
much.
justice
white
well,
you
did--
justice
white
--well,
you
did
ask
for
that
much,
$700,000.
justice
white
well,
mr.
geller,
was
that
provision
you
just
read
ambiguous?
do
you
think
it
is
ambiguous?
justice
white
is
that
in
the
record,
is
that...
or
is
that
something--
justice
white
--judicial
notice
of?
justice
white
does
that
purport
to
be
an
official
position
of
the
department
or
not?
justice
white
well,
is
it--
justice
white
--well,
who...
was
it
a
study
by
a
high
school
person
or
by
a...
or
by
a
real
expert?
justice
white
you
mean
a
changed
construction.
justice
white
a
change
in
the
construction.
justice
white
was
there
any
change
here?
justice
white
well,
not
by
the
secretary.
justice
white
well,
this
may...
this...
at
most
here,
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
construction
was
ever
spelled
out.
i
mean,
the
state
says
that
you
finally
learned
what
the
secretary
really
thought
it
meant.
justice
white
that's
not
a
change.
justice
white
it's
from
a
change,
it
is
a
change
with
respect
to
what
you
thought
it
meant.
justice
white
so
you
would
say
the
normal
rule
should
be
followed
that
if
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
a
reasonable
one,
we
should
accept
it.
justice
white
even
in
a
grant
program.
