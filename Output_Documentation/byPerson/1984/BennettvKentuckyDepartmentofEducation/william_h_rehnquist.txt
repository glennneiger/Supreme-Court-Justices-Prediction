justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
chenoweth,
i
think
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
this
case
and
pennhurst
in
that
the
argument,
as
i
recall,
was...
that
pennhurst
was
all
about
was
had
the
congress
made
a
particular
thing,
a
condition
of
the
grant
of
these
funds,
and
the
court
ended
up
saying
no,
congress
has
to
speak
unambiguously
if
it
is
going
to
make
something
a
condition.
here
there
is
no
question
but
what
compliance
with
these
regulations
was
a
condition
of
the
grant.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
saying
congress
has
to
speak
unambiguously
when
it
makes
a
particular
requirement
a
condition
of
a
grant.
that's
what
pennhurst
said.
and
to
go
further
and
say
congress
must
speak
unambiguously
when
it
is
laying
down
requirements
for
something
that
is
concededly
a
condition,
i
think
there
you
have
got
a
weaker
case.
justice
rehnquist
that's
why
i
don't
think
i
agree
with
the
sixth
circuit
on
that
point.
