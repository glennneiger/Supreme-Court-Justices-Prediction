the
bedrock
here--
justice
marshall
--the
bedrock
in
this
case
is
that
it
was
not
ambiguous.

how
soon
did
kentucky
find
that
out?
justice
marshall
how
soon
did
kentucky
find
out
that
there
was
not
a
meeting
of
the
minds?
justice
marshall
the
basis
of
that,
but
to
ask
when
did
you
try
to
get
an
understanding
about
it?
justice
marshall
when
it
became
ambiguous
to
you
was
in
'74?
justice
marshall
was
that
when
it
was
ambiguous?
justice
marshall
was
it
beginning
to
be
ambiguous?
justice
marshall
my
question
is,
when
did
you
first
let
anybody
know
that
you
considered
it
to
be
ambiguous?
justice
marshall
about
when?
justice
marshall
well,
it
was
a
little
before
today
wasn't
it?
justice
marshall
well,
then,
i
misunderstood
your
original
answer,
was
that
in
'74
you
realized
that
they
were
ambiguous.
justice
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
there
was
a
problem
in
'74.
justice
marshall
'74
is
not
after
the
fact
of
what
you
are
arguing
now.
justice
marshall
aren't
you
now
arguing
estoppel?
