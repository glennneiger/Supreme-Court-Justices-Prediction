justice
o'connor
mr.
geller,
the
congress
enacted
amendments
to
title
i
in
1978,
and
some
of
the
legislative
reports
in
connection
with
that
observed
that
the
supplanting
regulations
lacked
sufficient
clarity.
did
congress
itself
think
that
they
were
confusing,
i
gather?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
there
were
two
equally
plausible
constructions,
is
it
appropriate
in
your
view
that
we
might
treat
this
much
like
a
contractual
arrangement
and
say
that
we
are
going
to
apply
the
most
reasonable
interpretation?
justice
o'connor
in
other
words,
what
is
the
more
reasonable
or
most
reasonable?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
is
there
a
citation
to
the
specific
provision
for
the
formal
mechanism
for
obtaining
clarification?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
have
it
or
do
you
know
where
we
would
look
to
find
it,
mr.
geller?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
there
was
a
formal
mechanism,
but
it
isn't--
justice
o'connor
--it
isn't
established
by
regulation
or
anything
of
that
complexion.
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
federal
agency
were
aware
of
the
state's
particular
utilization
and
funding
and
made
no
objection?
does
that
make
any
difference
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
i
suppose,
though,
that
we
have
not
found
that
estoppel
runs
against
the
federal
government
generally,
even
in
that
situation.
justice
o'connor
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
it
is
appropriate
to
analogize
to
contract
law
to
a
degree
in
looking
at
these
cases
of
title
i
grants?
justice
o'connor
don't
they
impose
contractual
type
relationships
on
the--
justice
o'connor
well,
but
don't
those
statutes
and
regulations
in
effect
become
part
of
the
contractual
type
agreement
that
is
entered
into
with
the
state?
justice
o'connor
i
am
not
sure
it
would
alter
the
result,
but
i
am
trying
to
explore
the
framework
within
which
it
would
make
sense
to
analyze
it.
justice
o'connor
and
in
deed,
the
regular
first
and
second
grade
students
were
getting
the
benefit
of
a
lower
pupil-teacher
class
ratio
as
well--
justice
o'connor
--because
the
title
i
children
were
pulled
out
of
their
classrooms.
justice
o'connor
and
weren't
holding
them
back.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
i
would
just
explore
with
you
again
the
fact
that
getting
a
clear
answer
from
the
federal
agency
in
these
cases
isn't
always
as
easy
as
i
think
you
may
have
painted
it.
wouldn't
you
agree
with
me.
mr.
geller?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
it
sounds
nice
here
at
this
level,
but
on
the
practical
level,
it
is
sometimes
very
difficult
for
states
or
local
school
districts
to
get
a
response
to
a
question.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
may
not
provide
the
answer
in
this
case,
but
i
think
it
is
something
we
have
to
be
mindful
of
in
establishing
the
proper
mechanism
for
reviewing
these
cases.
justice
o'connor
mr.
chenoweth--
justice
o'connor
--on
the
same
point,
it
is
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
understand
why
you
contend
that
the
statute
and
regulations
are
ambiguous
or
confusing
in
any
way.
when
the
regulation
says
federal
funds
made
available
will
be
used
to
supplement
the
level
of
state
and
local
funds
that
would
be
used
in
the
absence
of
the
federal
funds
for
the
education
of
the
pupils
participating
in
the
project.
now,
how
is
that
ambiguous?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
talks
in
the
regulation
about
the
pupils
participating
in
the
project.
what
could
be
clearer
than
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
can
you
point
to
anything
in
the
language
of
that
regulation
which
i
read
from
that
is
ambiguous?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
regulation
refers
to
the
child.
justice
o'connor
is
that
an
estoppel
argument
of
some
kind?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
chenoweth,
i
suppose
that
the
program
itself,
operationally,
in
the
sense
of
providing
smaller
classroom
settings
for
children
within
an
appropriate
project
area,
children
who
qualified
for
the
aid,
is
something
that
the
federal
government
would
want
to
examine
in
any
event,
and
did,
and
the
question
of
whether
the
state
had
reduced
its
level
of
support
for
those
children
is
a
different
question,
is
it
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
federal
government
could
have
picked
up
its
alleged
problem
earlier
than
it
did,
but
do
you
think
that
that
alone
means
that
no
recovery
can
be
had?
justice
o'connor
well,
good
faith
is
not
normally
a
defense
either
to
the
application
of
an
appropriate
federal
statute
or
regulation
of
this
type
or,
if
you
treated
it
as
a
contract,
to
a
defense
under
a
contract
theory,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
without
looking
at
a
retroactive
change
at
all,
just
looking
at
the
statute
and
the
regulations
as
they
existed,
can't
they
be
enforced
in
the
way
in
which
they
were
written
at
the
time
the
grant
was
made?
justice
o'connor
well,
as
an
abstract
matter,
would
you
agree
they
can
be
applied
as
they
were
written
when
the
grant
was
made,
in
the
abstract?
is
that
a
valid
approach?
justice
o'connor
you
know,
i
just
really
am
troubled
by
your
insistence
on
the
repetition
of
the
word
"retroactive".
the
question,
of
course,
is
whether
it
is,
and
i
don't
think
that
has
been
conceded
at
all.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
agreement
itself,
of
course,
if
you
wanted
to
treat
it
as
a
contract,
provides
that
if
the
regulatory
requirements
aren't
met,
that
the
federal
government
may
require
reimbursement.
justice
o'connor
well,
and
even
if
you
didn't,
you
still
would
reach
the
result
for
which
you
are--
