justice
jr.
mr.
geller,
why
was
the
amount
reduced
in
the
determination
of
how
much
had
been
misspend?
justice
jr.
from
some
$700,000
to
$300,000.
justice
jr.
why?
justice
jr.
are
you
saying
in
effect
the
secretary
simply
conceded
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
he--
justice
jr.
mr.
geller,
excuse
me.
before
you
start,
would
you
mind
telling
me
something
about
how
this
grant
process
works?
for
example,
did
kentucky
make
any
undertaking
as
to
how
it
would
use
the--
justice
jr.
and
what
is
required
appears
on
the
application
form
or
something?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
jr.
you
argued
i
think
in
your
brief
that
the
kentucky
authorities
could
have
requested
clarification.
justice
jr.
how
would
they
go
about
that?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
geller,
is
it
true
that
the
federal
auditors
long
before
this
dispute
arose
had
reviewed
kentucky's
program
and
approved
it?
is
that
true?
justice
jr.
that
is
not--
justice
jr.
--incidentally,
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
there
are
no
limits
on
recoupment
other
than
such
as
might
be
prescribed
by
the
congress
or
by
the
secretary's
regulations?
justice
jr.
but
basically,
whatever
might
be
the
terms,
the
secretary
sets,
and
that's
it.
justice
jr.
or
the
congress,
yes.
justice
jr.
--is
it
sufficiently
like
a
contract
to
apply
against
the
government
that
old
principle
of
contract
construction
that
ambiguities
are
resolved
against
the
drafter
of
the
agreement?
justice
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
chenoweth,
were
the
details
of
the
readiness
program
given
in
the
initial
application
for
the
grant
by
the
state?
