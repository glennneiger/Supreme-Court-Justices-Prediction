justice
stevens
mr.
geller,
can
i
just
ask
one
question
about
the
clarity
of
the
violation
of
the
supplanting
regulation?
the
court
of
appeals
indicates
that
the
local
education
agency
in
kentucky
had
to
certify
that
there
would
be
the
same
number
of
teachers
that
would
be
paid
for
with
state
and
local
funds
as
without
the
title
i?
and
also
i
understand
at
least
as
much
money
went
into
each
local
education
agency
of
old
funds.
isn't
that
kind
of
a
good
prima
facie
indication,
unless
you
have
much
larger
student
bodies,
that
there
was
no
supplanting?
justice
stevens
well,
but
you
spend
money
on
children
indirectly
by
hiring
teachers
and
providing
classrooms,
and
i
guess
they
did
pay
for
the
classrooms
and
they
paid
for
the
same
number
of
teachers,
as
i
understand,
with
local
funds--
--the
amount,
the
confusion,
if
there
was
any
confusion
here,
was
that
the
amount
of
local
money
given
to
the
schools
each
year
remained
the
same,
but
the
problem
was
that
the
title
i
children
were
not
getting
the
benefit
of
any
of
that
money.
all
of
their
instruction
was
being
paid
for
by
the
federal
money,
and
that
is
where
the
supplanting
violation
occurred
as
the
sixth
circuit
ultimately
agreed,
there
was
in
fact
a
supplanting
violation.
and
therefore
the
same
amount
of
money
was
being
in
effect
used
to
give
a
better
education
to
those
who
were
not--
justice
stevens
--being
the
beneficiaries
of
title
i.
justice
stevens
but
then
you
are
arguing...
i
hate
to,
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you...
you
are
arguing
they
are
wrong
for
two
reasons:
one,
the
standard,
but
even
under
their
own
standard
they
are
wrong
is
what
you
are
saying.
justice
stevens
because
their
standard
is
really
not
all
that...
doesn't
seem
all
that
unreasonable
to
me,
to
be
quite
frank
with
you.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
geller,
if
you
take
your
standard...
and
i
realize
we
are
not
necessarily
talking
about
the
facts
here...
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
the
local
agency
must
take
the
funds
at
its
peril
unless
it
is
willing
to
go
get
an
advisory
ruling
before
it
actually
adopts
a
plan.
if
it
is
a
doubtful
case
and
it
takes
the
money,
it
may
end
up
having
to
spend
that
amount
of
money
itself.
that's
what
you
are
saying.
justice
stevens
yes,
i
understand,
unless
they
go
and
get
advice.
justice
stevens
and
you
don't
have
any
regulatory
scheme
regulating
the
way
to
go
get
advice.
understand
it
was
available
and
they
could
do
it,
but
you
didn't
spell
it
out
in
your
regulation.
justice
stevens
well,
i
suppose
under
your
test,
even
if
they
got
advice
and
the
advice
was
wrong...
say
they
asked
the
wrong
official
and
he
misread
the
regulations,
too,
the
government
wouldn't
be
bound
by
that
advice.
justice
stevens
but
that's
part
of
the
problem
of
the--
justice
stevens
--yes,
but
it
also
said
you
can't
rely
on
oral
advice.
justice
stevens
you
are
not
now
arguing
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
continued
to
supply
the
same
amount
of
money
would
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
supplanting,
are
you?
justice
stevens
for
example,
if
they
shifted
all
the
money
they...
all
their
first
and
second
grade
teachers
into
the
higher
grades
and
reduced
the
ratios
in
the
higher
grades
and
then
financed
first
and
second
grade
entirely
with
federal
money,
you
would
say
that
would
be
a
clear
violation?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
one...
it
is
in
the
brief,
i
know,
but
would
you
state
again
for
me
the
standard
for
which
you
contend?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
so
it
is
an
arbitrary
and
capricious?
