you
are
ready.

e.

we
will
go
on
at

o'clock.
thank
you,
mr.

mr.
geller,
you
may
resume
the
argument.
chief

warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
they
do
that
at
their
own
peril.
chief
justice
burger
did
you
furnish
one
or
nine?
chief

e.
burger
mr.
chenoweth?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
say
that
these
provisions
were
ambiguous,
mr.
chenoweth?
chief
justice
burger
why
not
get
a
clarification
then?
chief
justice
burger
well,
maybe
it
would
be
a
splendid
program,
a
beautiful
program,
but
not
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
merits
of
the
program
in
the
abstract
are
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
whether
the
money
was
spent
within
the
framework
of
the
particular
purpose
for
which
it
was
given.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
geller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
hear
arguments
next
in
bell
v.
new
jersey.
