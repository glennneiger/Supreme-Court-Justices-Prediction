mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
years
ago
in
bell
v.
new
jersey,
this
court
unanimously
held
that
the
federal
government
may
recoup
misspent
grant
funds
under
title
i
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965.
the
two
cases
that
the
court
will
hear
this
afternoon
involve
court
of
appeals
decisions
announcing
erroneous
rules
of
construction
that
substantially
frustrate
the
exercise
of
this
recoupment
remedy.
in
this
case,
the
kentucky
case,
the
sixth
circuit
has
held
that
misspent
grant
funds
may
be
recovered
only
when
the
violation
is
so
plain
that
the
grantee
could
not
reasonably
have
believed
that
its
expenditures
were
lawful.
in
our
view
there
is
no
legal
basis
for
this
ruling.
now,
as
the
court
is
aware,
congress
passed
the
title
i
statute
in
1965
for
the
purpose
of
expanding
and
improving
programs
designed
to
meet
the
special
educational
needs
of
educationally
deprived
children
in
low
income
areas.
now,
from
the
outset,
the
title
i
program
has
been
designed
to
provide
supplemental
federal
educational
aid
to
these
educationally
deprived
children
over
and
above
whatever
assistance
they
would
be
entitled
to
receive
from
state
and
local
funds,
and
in
order
to
ensure
that
federal
monies
are
used
solely
for
this
purpose,
the
title
i
program
has
always
included
since
1965
the
so-called
supplanting
prohibition.
now,
this
provision
expressly
states
that
title
i
funds
may
be
used
only
to
supplement
the
level
of
funds
that
would
in
the
absence
of
title
i
be
made
available
from
state
and
local
sources
for
the
education
of
children
participating
in
the
title
i
program.
in
other
words,
title
i
is
designed
to
provide
an
additional
layer
of
federal
benefits
for
certain
educationally
deprived
children
rather
than
to
take
the
place
of
any
money
that
the
state
or
local
government
would
otherwise
provide
for
educating
these
children.
the
antisupplanting
requirement
has
always
been
at
the
heart
of
the
title
i
program,
and
it
has
always
been
an
express
condition
on
the
receipt
of
federal
funds.
now,
this
case
involves
the
way
in
which
kentucky
operated
its
so-called
readiness
programs
in
1974
under
title
i.
these
readiness
classes
were
for
children
who
were
not
prepared
to
enter
the
regular
first
or
second
grade
because
of
educational
difficulties.
and
in
states
other
than
kentucky,
title
i
programs
provided
children
such
as
these
with
federally
funded
supplemental
instruction
in
addition
to
whatever
state-funded
instruction
they
were
entitled
to
receive.
but
what
kentucky
did
was
the
following:
it
set
up
special
self-contained
full
day
classes
for
these
educationally
deprived
children
wholly
apart
from
the
regular
instructional
program,
and
it
funded
these
classes
almost
exclusively
out
of
federal
title
i
funds.
in
other
words,
these
students
received
virtually
their
entire
academic
instruction
for
the
first
and
second
grade
through
the
title
i
program
rather
than
through
the
regular
state-funded
school
program.
as
a
result,
it
is
quite
obvious
that
kentucky
was
using
federal
funds
to
supplant
state
and
local
funds
that
otherwise
would
have
been
available
for
the
children
in
these
readiness
classes.
and
the
readiness
classes
unquestionably
took
the
place
of
the
regular
first
and
second
grade
classes
that
these
students
would
have
attended
in
the
absence
of
the
title
i
program.
and
in
fact,
nearly
half
of
the
students
in
these
readiness
classes
were
actually
promoted
to
the
second
or
third
grade
after
they
had
completed
their
year
of
readiness
training.
so
it
is
quite
clear
that
at
least
as
to
those
students,
federal
funds
were
being
used
for
regular
rather
than
supplemental
instruction.
now,
when
federal
auditors
examined
the
kentucky
title
i
program
for
1974,
they
concluded
not
surprisingly
that
a
supplanting
violation
had
occurred.
kentucky
challenged
this
finding
before
the
education
appeal
board.
now,
kentucky
conceded
that
virtually
no
state
and
local
funds
had
been
spent
for
the
basic
instructional
costs
of
the
title
i
children
in
the
readiness
classes,
but
it
argued
that
a
supplanting
violation
nonetheless
had
not
occurred
because
there
had
been
no
decrease
in
state
and
local
funds
for
the
schools
involved.
now,
this
argument
was
rejected
by
the
auditors,
by
the
education
appeal
board,
and
by
the
secretary
of
education,
all
of
whom
concluded
that
the
antisupplanting
provisions
of
the
statute
and
regulations
were
crystal
clear
in
their
emphasis
on
maintaining
state
and
local
funds
for
the
particular
title
i
children
rather
than
simply
for
particular
schools.
but
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
recoupment
order.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
actually
with
the
secretary's
reading
of
the
antisupplanting
provisions.
the
sixth
circuit
specifically
held
that
the
prohibition
against
supplanting
state
and
local
funds
with
federal
funds
could
be
read
to
refer
to
expenditures
at
the
level
of
the
educationally
deprived
child
rather
than
at
the
school
level,
and
it
therefore
held
that
the
secretary's
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
supplanting
provisions
would
govern
all
future
title
i
grants.
but
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
kentucky's
interpretation
of
the
supplanting
prohibition
also
was
reasonable,
and
in
these
circumstances
the
court
held
that
the
secretary
could
not
recoup
the
concededly
misspent
funds
because
the
statutory
and
regulatory
provisions
at
issue
were
not
sufficiently
clear
to
apprise
the
state
of
its
responsibilities.
now--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
congress
did
not
amend
in
any
way
the
supplanting
provisions.
we
don't
contend,
i
should
add
quickly,
that
every
conceivable
application
of
the
supplanting
provisions
would
be
crystal
clear
to
every
observer.
what
we
do
contend
that
is
that
in
this
case
there
really
was
no
two,
there
weren't
one
or
two
reasonable
constructions
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
what
we
are
concerned
with
here.
but
congress
didn't
amend
the
supplanting
provisions,
and
in
fact,
they--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
in
our
view,
even
if
there
were
two
reasonable
interpretations,
the
question
would
still
be
was
the
secretary's
interpretation
correct?
in
other
words,
what
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute
if
in
fact
under
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
the
funds
were
misspend?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
well,
the
question,
the
issue
in
this
case
really
only
arises,
justice
o'connor,
when
there
has
been
a
determination
as
there
was
in
this
case
that
the
funds
were
in
fact
misspend.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
that
situation,
our
submission
is
that
the
secretary's
recoupment
authority
is
not
in
any
way
limited
by
the
fact
that
the
state
may
have
been
acting
reasonably.
i
hope
to
discuss
a
little
bit
later
on,
after
lunch,
why...
what
the
state
should
do
when
it
is
faced
with
an
ambiguity,
and
it
should
not,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
simply
adopt
whatever
interpretation
was
most
favorable
to
it,
and
then
spend
the
money--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
amount--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
was
seven
hundred...
yes,
it
was
reduced
by
the
secretary
of
education--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--from
$700,000
to
$300,000
because
these
readiness
classes
had
a
smaller
student-teacher
ratio
than
in
the
regular
classes.
i
think
the
ratio
in
the
readiness
classes
was
13
students
to
one
teacher--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
no,
not
at
all.
what
the
secretary
concluded
is
that
some
supplementing
was
going
on
in
these
readiness
classes.
it
wasn't
a
question
of
total
supplanting.
there
was
some
additional
benefit
being
given
to
the
title
i
students
in
the
fact
that
they
had
smaller
classes,
and
the
secretary
took
account
of
those
smaller
classes
by
reducing
the
recoupment
to
the
amount
that
constituted
the
supplanting.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
wasn't
a
mistake,
there
was
a
different--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--different
calculation
of
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
in
order
to
get
the
title
i
grant--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
local
school
district
had
to
make
certain
representations
to
the
state
itself
as
to
how
it
would
use
the
grant.
the
state...
one
of
those
representations
was
that
it
would
abide
by
the
supplanting
prohibitions
of
the
statute,
and
the
state
made
similar
representations
to
the
federal
government
in
order
to
get
the
federal
title
i
grants.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
in
fact,
it
is
even
more...
it
is
even
more
explicit
than
that,
justice
brennan.
the
specific
form
that
the
state,
the
local
education
agency
filled
out
in
this
case
is
on
page
27a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
standard
grant
application
completed
in
the
middle
of
the
page
by
each
of
the
50
leas,
or
the
local
school
districts,
for
the
year
in
dispute,
contain
the
following
question,
and
that
was
will
you
use
this
program
to
assure
that
children
participating
in
the
component
activity
will
receive
this
title
i
service
in
addition
to
services
that
they
are
ordinarily
entitled
to
receive
from
state
and
local
funds,
and
the
district
obviously
answered
that
question
that
it
would,
and
as
the
education
appeal
board
stated
right
after
that,
if
they
had
abided
by
this
assurance,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
supplanting
violation
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
is
constant
contact,
as
the
court
will
imagine,
between
the
local
title
i
administrators
and
the
federal
title
i
administrators.
in
fact,
during
the
year
in
question
in
this
case,
in
1974,
there
were
program
review
teams
right
on
the
premises
in
kentucky,
and
they
could
have
been
asked
for
an
opinion.
but
beyond
that,
over
the
period
that
the
title
i
statute
has
been
in
existence,
there
has
been
a
formal
mechanism
for
constant
communication
between
federal
and
state
authorities
whereby
state
authorities
that
have
some
question
as
to
how
an
ambiguous
provision
should
be
interpreted
can
get
a
determination
from
the
federal
authorities.
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
don't
think
it
is
at
all
ambiguous,
but
the
state
thought
it
was
ambiguous,
or
at
least
they
now
allege
that
they
thought
it
was
ambiguous,
but
rather
than
asking
for
a
definitive
interpretation
of
the
ambiguous
provision,
they
adopted
their
own
interpretation
and
spent
the
money
in
accordance
with
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
our...
that
is
our
position.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
in
this
regard
to
the
report
of
the
national
institute
of
education,
a
copy
of
which
has
been
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
this
was
a
report
prepared
after
a
comprehensive
study
of
the
title
i
program
undertaken
in
the
mid-1970s
by
the
national
institute
of
education.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
it
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
it
is
a
report
of
the
national
institute
of
education,
which
is
part
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
this
was
furnished
by
the
amici,
and
the
clerk
would
have
the
copies.
i
am
sure
how
many...
we
would
be
glad
to
furnish
extra
copies
to
the
court,
but
one
of
the...
this
was,
as
i
say--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
this
is
a
study
that
was
undertaken
at
congress'
behest
of
the
title
i
statute,
title
i...
administration
of
the
title
i
program
in
the
mid-1970s
by--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
is
not
by
the
department
of
education.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
was
a
study
by
i
think
real
experts.
this
is
the
national
institute
of
education,
justice
white,
and
one
of
the
points
that
they
made...
this
is
at
page
18
of
the
report
which
is
in
the
clerk's
possession,
is
that
the
office
of
education,
as
it
was
then
called,
had
a
formal
mechanism
by
which
is
gave
advice
to
grantees
when
they
were
confronted
with
ambiguous
provisions
in
the
statute
and
regulations
as
kentucky
claims
it
was
confronted
with
here,
and
if
i
could
just
read
one
sentence
from
this
nie
report,
the
report
said
in
an
effort
to
improve
the
clarify
of
the
legal
framework,
the
office
of
education
has
adopted
the
practice
of
providing
individual
interpretive
responses
to
state
and
local
inquiries.
on
the
basis
of
a
review
of
the
responses
issued
since
1968,
nie,
which
was
the
national
institute
of
education,
concluded
that
the
office
of
education
has
addressed
many
of
the
most
difficult
and
controversial
issues
in
the
legal
framework,
and
then
the
report
goes
on
to
discuss
one
particular
area
in
which
a
number
of
interpretations
had
been
given
to
state
grantees,
and
that
is
the
supplanting
area,
the
very
area
that
we
are
involved
with
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
citation
in
the
nie
report?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
no,
but...
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a
formal
citation.
this
is
something--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
mechanism
was--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it's
not
established
by...
as
far
a
i
know,
by
regulation,
but
every
grantee
obviously
was
aware
because
there
was
this
constant
contact
with
federal
administrators
of
the
opportunity
to
ask
for
a
clarification
of
an
ambiguous
provision
rather
than
simply
to
adopt
one's
own
interpretation
and
to
act
accordingly
at
one's
peril.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
not...
they
had
never
approved.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
not
true.
there
had
been
program
teams
on
the
premises,
but
they
had
never
approved
the
actual
funding
of
these
programs
because
just
simply
by
looking
at
the
program
there
would
be
no
way
to
know
how
it
was
funded,
and
the
supplanting
violation
occurred
not
in
the
way
the
program
was
organized
but
in
the
way
it
was
funded.
kentucky
never
asked
for
an
interpretation
of
whether
the
way
it
was
funding
its
program
violated
the
supplanting
provisions
until
after
the
year
in
question
here,
and
as
soon
as
it
asked
for
that
interpretation,
it
was
immediately
told
by
the
federal
officials
that
this
was
a
supplanting
violation
because
all
of
the
monies
of
this
instructional
program
were
federal
monies,
and
as
a
result,
state
and
federal
authorities
immediately
got
together
and
worked
out
a
program
by
which
the
readiness
classes
could
be
continued
under
a
funding
arrangement
that
would
not
violate
the
supplanting
provision.
so
if
kentucky
had
simply
asked
before
1974,
none
of
this
would
have
occurred.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
our
legal
position.
obviously
the
secretary
as
a
matter
of
administrative
discretion
does
not
seek
recoupment
in
every
circumstance
in
which
it
could.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
basically...
that's
right.
well,
congress
sets.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
congress
sets,
and
congress
has
set
out
recoupment
provisions.
now--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
if
the
state
got
an
interpretation
from
the
education
department
that
its
program
was
in
compliance
with
the
law,
it
would
make
a
big
difference.
as
far
as
we
know,
there
has
never
been
an
instance...
the
nie
report
talks
about
20
years
worth
of
interpretations
given
to
the
states.
we
don't
know
of
a
single
instance
in
which
a
state
asks
for
an
opinion
as
to
whether
what
it
was
proposing
to
do
would
violate
the
statute,
was
told
by
the
department
of
education
that
it
wouldn't,
and
thereafter
there
was
an
attempt
at
recoupment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
am
not
sure
it
would
be
an
estoppel
situation,
justice
o'connor,
because
if
it
was
an
authoritative
interpretation...
i
mean,
agencies
do
have
to
follow
their
own
regulations.
the
estoppel
cases
that
this
court
has
confronted,
such
as
community
health
service
and
schweiker
v.
hansen
and
cases
like
that
were
all
cases
in
which
the
person
giving
the
advice
was
not
authorized
to
give
the
advice
to
bind
the
agency.
but
we
are
talking
here
about
authoritative
interpretations
from
the
department
of
education.
and
there
has
never
been
a
litigation
over
estoppel
because
the
department
of
education
has
never
tried
to
repudiate
one
of
these
positions.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
it
is
contractual
type
in
the
sense
that
there
is
an
agreement,
but
it
is
not
a
contract,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
that
the
requirements
that
are
imposed
here
are
requirements
imposed
by
congress
pursuant
to
statutes
and
regulations.
they
are
not
contractual
provisions
whereby
a
and
b
sit
down
and
work
out
the
best
arrangement
between
themselves
in
anticipation
of
what
is
likely
to
occur.
here
we
are
talking--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
we
have
answered
that,
i
think,
in
our
reply
brief,
justice
brennan.
it
is
not.
we
are
construing
here
not
contract
terms
but
portions
of
a
statute
and
regulations.
i
don't
know
of
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
a
statute
should
be
construed
against
the
drafter,
that
is,
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
the
sense
that
the
grantees
are
bound
by
them,
but
that
is
not
the
question.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
is
an
agreement
here,
and
i
think
the
framework
to
analyze
whether
the
agreement
has
been
violated
is
to
recognize
that
this
is
an
appeal
of
an
administrative
order
finding
recoupment,
and
there
is
a
body
of
law
as
to
when
a
court
can
set
aside
an
administrative
order.
and
that
is
how
i
think
this
court
has
to
analyze
the
correctness
of
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
not,
justice
stevens.
there
were
a
number
of
obligations
imposed
on
leas,
or
local
education
agencies.
one
was
the
comparability
requirement
which
required
that
schools
get
as
much
money
from
the
lea
each
year
as
they
got
before
the
title
i
money
came
into
effect.
now,
we
are
talking
here
about
a
totally
different
requirement
which
is
the
supplanting
requirement,
which
on
its
face,
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
statute
and
regulations,
talks
about
the
amount
of
local
money
being
spent
on
the
children
involved.
i
think
there
was
some
confusion
on--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--to
the
non-title--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--exactly,
non-title
i
children.
so
they
were
getting
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
state
money
rather
than
simply
their
proportionate
share.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
these
are
non-title
i
statutes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
exactly
right.
that's
in
large
part
the
supplanting
violation
here.
the
money,
the
state
and
local
money
was
being
used
for
the
benefit
of...
only
of
the
non-title...
non-title
i
children.
so
we
don't
think...
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
plainly
wrong
for
two
independent
reasons.
one
is
i
don't
think
that
anyone
looking
at
the
statute
and
regulations,
the
clarity
with
which
they
are
written,
could
really
conclude
that
there
was
an
ambiguity
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
even
under
their
own
standard,
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
the
stand
is
wrong,
but
even
under
their
own
standard,
it
is
hard
for
anyone
i
think
to
look
at
the
statute
and
regulations
here
and
conclude
that
there
was
an
ambiguity
or
conclude
that
kentucky
actually
had
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
statute
and
regulation.
so
even
by
their
own
lights,
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong.
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
problem
with
the
sixth
circuit's
test
as
well
because
even
if
we
were
to
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
supplanting
statute
and
regulations
were
in
fact
ambiguous,
and
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
kentucky
adopted
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
those
provisions,
both
assumptions
i
think
are
quite
dubious,
but
even
if
we
were
to
make
them,
we
still
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
reversing
the
administrative
order
requiring
recoupment
of
the
misspent
funds
and
that
is
because
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
that
there
has
to
be
some
violation
of
law
before
a
court
of
appeals
can
set
aside
an
administrative
order.
now,
as
i
noted
a
moment
ago,
the
court
of
appeals
here
found
that
in
this
case
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
supplanting
provisions
was
reasonable.
in
fact,
far
from
finding
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
was
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
in
violation
of
law,
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
it
was
reasonable
and
would
govern
all
future
grants,
and
there
has
never
been
any
question
here
that
there
was
substantial
evidence.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if...
we
don't
say
that
they
take
it
at
their
peril,
justice
stevens,
because
there
is
an
important
point,
and
that
is
they
can
ask
for
an
interpretation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
unless...
and
i
don't
think
that
is
unreasonable.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
that
the
court
has
to
understand
under
the
title
i
program,
as
in
many
of
these
grant
programs,
there
is
constant
contact
between
the
state
and
the
federal
administrators.
there
is
no
suggestion
here
on
the
part
of
kentucky
that
they
didn't
know
they
could
ask
for
advice.
in
fact,
they
asked
for
advice
in
the
next
year,
and
when
they
got
the
advice,
they
stopped
the
way
the
readiness
program
was
funded.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
that
relates
to
the
response
i
gave
to
justice--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--justice
o'connor.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
an
estoppel
problem
if
they
got
advice
from
the
official
who
is
authorized
to
speak
for
the
department
on
that
matter.
i
think
what
i
am
saying
here
is
nothing
more
than
what
the
court
said
last
term
in
the
heckler
v.
community
health
services
case,
which
was
a
very
similar
case,
and
the
court
there
said
explicitly
that
people
who
get
federal
funds
have
to
act
cautiously.
if
there
is
an
ambiguity,
they
have
to
ask
for
advice,
and
they
have
to
ask
for
advice
from
an
official
that
they--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
but...
well,
first
of
all,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
advice
from
the
department
of
education
here
would
be
oral.
the
national
institute
of
education
is
talking
about
written.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
was
not
ambiguous
and
kentucky
never
asked
for
advice
if
they
thought
it
was
ambiguous.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
here
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
reasonable.
there
has
never
been
any
suggestion
that
there
wasn't
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
secretary's
determination.
so
what
legal
basis
is
there
to
set
aside
the
administrative
order?
now,
the
sixth
circuit
clearly
couldn't
have
been
relying
on
the
title
i
statute
itself
because
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
look
at
the
recoupment
provisions
of
the
title
i
statute.
20
u.s.c.
1234(a),
which
is
the
recoupment
provision,
says
whenever
the
secretary
determines
that
an
expenditure
not
allowable
under
a
program
has
been
made
by
a
state,
the
secretary
shall
give
such
state
written
notice
of
a
final
audit
determination
and
shall
recoup
the
money.
and
the
audit
statute,
which
is
20
u.s.c.
2835,
says
the
same
thing.
it
says
the
secretary
shall
require
the
repayment
of
the
amount
of
funds
under
this
subchapter
which
have
been
finally
determined
through
the
audit
resolution
process
to
have
been
misspent
or
misapplied.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
statutes
that
congress
passed
that
the
secretary's
recoupment
authority
was
limited
to
situations
where
the
grantee
has
acted
in
bad
faith
or
is
limited
to
situations
where
the
grantee
has
acted
reasonably,
or
that
in
determining
whether
a
recoupment
order
is
valid,
the
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
defer
to
the
grantee's
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute
rather
than
the
secretary's.
the
statute
itself
say
precisely
the
opposite.
and
i
should
add
in
this
regard
that
in
the
last
few
years
the
states
have
sought
an
amendment
of
the
title
i
statute
from
congress
which
would
have
done
precisely
what
they
are
asking
this
court
to
do
in
this
case,
which
is
to
essentially
have
a
qualified
immunity
defense
in
these
sorts
of
proceedings.
and
congress
has
on
several
occasions
refused
to
do
that.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
can't--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--all
i
can
say
in
response,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
report
of
the
nie
found
otherwise,
that
there
is
this
regular
process
of
giving
advice.
i
would
say
in
this
case
that
that
is
a
particularly
hollow
claim
for
kentucky
to
make
in
this
case
when
they
never
even
sought
advice,
and
also,
that
the
year
afterwards,
when
they
did
seek
advice,
they
had
no
trouble
whatsoever
in
getting
the
correct
answer.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
i
just
think
that
when
the
court
announces
what
the
rules
will
be
in
this
case,
it
has
to
think
of
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception,
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
grantees
as
a
rule
have
any
trouble
in
getting
answers
to
their
ambiguous
questions.
i
think
that
the
experience
of
the
last
20
years
and
the
experience
in
this
very
case
suggests
otherwise.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i
don't
have
anything.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
is
the
legal
standard
that
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--this
is
a
review
of
an
administrative
order.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
is
more
contrary...
well,
it
is
the
administrative
procedure
act.
there
has
to
be
a
finding
of
lack
of
substantial
evidence,
which
there
hasn't
been
here,
or
there
has
to
be
a
finding
that
the
secretary
committed
some
legal
error
in
seeking
recoupment.
but
it
has
been
conceded,
i
think,
that
there
was
a
misspending
here.
so
unless
something
in
the
title
i
statute
prevents
the
secretary
from
recouping
money
that
has
been
misspent,
we
don't
think
that
there
can
be
any
overturning
of
that
recoupment
decision.
and
as
i
read
earlier,
the
title
i
recoupment
provisions
contain
nothing
suggesting
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
showing
bad
faith
or
showing
that
the
grantee
did
not
act
reasonably
or
any
of
the
other
things
that
kentucky
is
arguing
for
today.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
even
in
a
grant
program.
this
court,
let
me
just
add
by
saying--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
because
i
think,
as
you
correctly
stated,
there
is
really
no
ambiguity
here.
thank
you.
