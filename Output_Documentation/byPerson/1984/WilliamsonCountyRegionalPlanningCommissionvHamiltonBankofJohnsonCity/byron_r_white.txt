justice
white
well,
you
lost
anyway.
justice
white
now,
is
this
a
recital
of
the
eight
objections
of
the
commission
in
'81?
justice
white
six
of
them?
justice
white
don't
you...
what
relief
do
you
ask
here?
justice
white
i
thought
the
trial
court
also
enjoined
you
from
applying
the
later
regulations?
justice
white
well,
if
we
reinstate
the
district
court's
judgment,
you
are
subject
to
an
injunction
not
to
apply
the
later
regulation.
justice
white
then
if
you
get
what
you
want,
there
will
be
an
injunction
against
you
in
the
district
court.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
so
you
are
conceding
you
are
not
entitled
to
apply
the
later
regulations,
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
you
haven't
come
up
here
with
a...
you
seem
to
want
to
live
with
that
injunction.
justice
white
why?
justice
white
what
you
did
do,
you
did
apply
it
in
turning
down
this
plat.
justice
white
well,
but
that's
a
factual
thing.
that's
something
you
want
us
to
pass
on
up
here
in
the
first
instance,
whether
this
complied
with
the
'73
regulations?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
turned
them
down
based
on
the
later
regulations.
justice
white
now
you
are
enjoined
from
doing
so.
justice
white
and
you
want
us
to
say
you
were
right
in
the
first
place
based
on
the
'72
regulations.
justice
white
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
white
i
know,
that's
just
an
initial
piece
of
factfinding
by
us
you
are
asking
us
to
perform.
justice
white
--well,
mr.
kneedler,
does
the
government
take
a
position
on
whether
the
commission
was
entitled
to
apply
the
later
regulations?
justice
white
i
thought
part
of
the
claim
or
a
major
part
of
the
claim
was
that
they
applied
later
regulations
that
really
affected
the
taking.
justice
white
when
would
there
ever
be
a
taking
if
the...
there
wouldn't
be
a
taking
if
the
commission
acted
properly,
and
there
isn't
a
taking
if
they
acted
improperly.
justice
white
and
there
isn't
a
taking
because
they
acted
improperly.
justice
white
so
a
commission
may
just
completely
disobey
a
state
law
and
deny
the
landowner
any
use
of
his
property,
and
there
still
isn't
a
taking?
justice
white
because
the...
because
why?
justice
white
somebody
just
booped
it.
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
the
damage
was
done
to
your
client
by
the
application
of
the
later
regulations?
justice
white
and
what's
your
answer
to
the
government
that
says,
well,
the
zoning
board,
whoever
it
was,
just
made
a
mistake
and
they
shouldn't
have
applied
the
later
regulations.
that
was
contrary
to
state
law,
and
there
can't
be
a
taking
just
based
on
an
error
of
an
agent.
justice
white
well,
they...
mr.
kneedler
seemed
to
say
that
if
the
state
law
had
actually
authorized
the
application
of
these
later
regulations,
maybe
there
would
have
been
a
taking,
or
could
have
been.
justice
white
well,
you
do
have
to
answer
the
claim,
though,
that
there
can
be
a
taking
that
results
merely
from
an
error
of
state
law.
justice
white
can
there
be?
justice
white
you
have
to
take
that
position.
justice
white
but
you
do
have
to
claim
that
if
this
taking
resulted
from
the
application
of
the
later
regulations,
you
have
to...
if
that's
what...
you
then
have
to
answer
the
claim
that,
well,
yes,
but
the
application
of
the
later
regulations
was
contrary
to
state
law.
justice
white
--in
my
view,
you
might
have
two
answers
to
it:
one,
it
was
consistent
with
state
law
to
apply
them,
but
even
if
it
wasn't,
there
can
still
be
a
taking?
justice
white
was
there
a
holding
below
by
the
lower
courts
that
the
application
of
the
later
regulations
was
improper
under
state
law?
justice
white
is
part
of
your
claim
that
the
application
of
later
regulations
was
forbidden
by
the
federal
constitution,
or
were
they
just
forbidden
by
state
law?
justice
white
no,
that
isn't--
--they
are
not
illegal
under
the
fifth
amendment,
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
extent
that
hamilton
has
been
compensated.
as
to
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
on
october
2...
keeping
in
mind
for
just
a
moment
a
time
line...
on
october
2
of
1980,
for
the
first
time,
a
plat
was
denied
approval
by
the
planning
commission.
on
october
3,
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
developer
as
to
what
do
we
do
next
now
that
our
plat
has
been
denied,
an
officer
of
the
planning
commission
wrote
and
suggested
an
appeal
to
the
board
of
zoning
appeals.
forgive
me.
will
you
give
me
the
date
again?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
this
is
all
1980.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
i
gather
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
has
no
enforcement
authority
at
all?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
i
suppose
the
existence
of
the
inunction
against
applying
the
later
regulations
but
off
the
running
of
the
damages,
is
that
it?
justice
white
damages
are
not
now
accruing.
justice
white
and
so
what
has
happened
to
the
property
after
all
this
time?
justice
white
so
you
filed
a
plat
that
has
been
approved
apparently.
justice
white
yes,
i
understand.
okay.
justice
white
did
you
try
the
case?
justice
white
do
the
complete
instructions
to
the
jury
appear
in
the
record?
justice
white
and
were
there
any
objections
on
either
side
to
those
instructions
as
they
were
delivered?
justice
white
no
instructions
on
the
law
as
to
what
a
taking
was
or
anything?
justice
white
i
know,
but
no
objections?
justice
white
well,
all
of
the
instructions
appear
in
the
record,
i
take
it.
justice
white
so
i
guess
we
can
find
that
out.
