mr.
g.
t.
nebel
i
thank
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
state
will
be
required
to
pay
just
compensation
when
its
regulations
destroy
all
practical
economic
value
of
private
property.
to
resolve
that
issue,
hamilton
proposes
the
following
two
propositions
of
law:
first,
zoning
regulations
can
effect
a
fifth
amendment
taking,
at
least
in
those
rare
cases
in
which
the
regulations
go
too
far
and
destroy
all
practical
economic
value.
secondly,
when
a
fifth
amendment
regulatory
taking
has
occurred,
the
appropriate
remedy
is
compensation.
now,
returning
to
my
first
proposition
which
really
leads
me
to
respond
to
several
of
the
questions
raised
by
the
court,
after
15
days
of
trial,
27
witnesses,
and
hundreds
of
documents,
the
jury
was
submitted
the
following
special
interrogatory:
has
plaintiff
been
denied
economically
viable
use
of
its
property
in
violation
of
the
just
compensation
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
fact,
the
jury
was
specifically
instructed
that
if
there
was
any
economically
viable
use
of
the
property
remaining,
then
no
fifth
amendment
taking
could
occur.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
your
honor.
the
$350,000
figure
really
came
from
the
holding
costs
associated
during
the
temporary
taking.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
the
holding
costs,
the
loss
of
the
use
of
the
money.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
not
the
lost
interest,
not
the
lost
profit
that
hamilton
could
have
made
by
reinvesting
that
money
and
loaning
it
to
someone
else
and
charging
a
higher
rate
of
interest,
but
specifically,
the
record
reveals
that
there
were
$393,000
in
damages
to
hamilton
from
loss
of
use
of
the
money,
and
that
formula
came
from
very
reasonable
calculation,
namely,
the
cost
to
hamilton
under
the
fed
fund
discount
rate.
so
really,
all
the
jury
found,
among
other
costs
associated,
was
that
hamilton
was
entitled
to
recover
a
portion
of
the
holding
cost
of
the
property
when
the
period
was
temporarily...
excuse
me,
when
the
property
was
temporarily
taken
from
hamilton
during
that
sixteen
month
period.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
your
honor,
we...
in
light
of
the
injunction
that
we
got
with
it,
we
wouldn't
have
appealed
from
the
district
court
decision
if
there
hadn't
been
a
judgment
nov.
we
didn't
receive
everything,
and
under
the
course
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
we
were
entitled
to
be
put
in
the
same
monetary
position
as
if
the
taking
had
not
occurred,
and
we
never
did
get
to
that
point,
but
we
would
have
been
satisfied,
intelligence.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
your
honor,
there
are,
of
course,
the
law
in
that
area
is
summarized
in
the
san
diego
gas
opinion,
dissenting
opinion
by
justice
brennan.
most
recently--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--well,
for
example,
in
buckelshaus
v.
monsanto,
last
term,
this
court
found
a
regulatory
taking
and
found
that
compensation
was
the
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor.
this
is...
this
is
different
from
all
the
cases
where
there's
been
a
mere
denial
of
the
highest
and
best
use
or
some
de
valuation
of
the
property.
hamilton
has
never
contended
that
it
was
a
mere
denial
of
the
highest
and
best
use.
this
is
a
case
where
100
percent
of
the
total
practical
economic
value
of
the
property
was
wiped
out.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
that's
exactly
what
the
jury
found.
that
special
interrogatory
that
i
read
a
few
moments
ago
was
a
quote
which
of
course
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
and
is
part
of
the
record.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor's
question
to
the
extent
that
you
were
stating
a
proposition,
and
in
that
case
you
would
never
have
a
taking.
this
court
held
in
euclid,
i
believe
it
was,
that--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--well,
that
really
goes,
i
think,
to
the
question
of
public
use.
i
think
that
is
how
he
is
trying
to
tie
this
up.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
and
your
honor,
the
answer--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--yes,
yes.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
your
honor,
i
will
respond
to
your
question.
obviously
those
aren't
the
facts
here.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
the
taking
here
was
authorized
by
state
law,
and
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
to
your
question,
justice
white,
that
we
have
to
find
an
unauthorized
act.
i
don't
think
i
did
state
that.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
no.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
that's
not
true,
first
all,
in
this
instance,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
to
the
extent,
to
the
extent
that
those--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--that
is
correct,
and
that
is
our
position
because
cases
that
hold
such,
the
fact
that
the
state
acted
under
color
of
state
law,
or
the
planning
commission
in
this
case
acted
under
color
of
state
law
i
think
is
sufficient
to
meet
that
requirement,
and
of
course,
that's
not
what
we
have
here
anyhow.
we
have
a
planning
commission
that
was
acting
pursuant
to
regularly
adopted
and
promulgated
state
planning
laws.
but
the
impact,
it
is
the
economic
impact
of
those
regulations
that
was
illegal,
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment.
there
isn't
anything
on
the
face
of
those
regulations
that
is
illegal.
it
is
the
application
of
those
regulations
to
our
property,
and
the
economic
impact--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--yes,
that's
the
impact
of
the
estoppel
verdict,
your
honor.
under
tennessee
state
law,
the
jury
also
determined,
in
addition
to
answering
the
taking
question,
the
jury
also
determined
that
the
defendant
should
be
estopped
from
imposing
those
new
regulations.
that
doesn't
mean
again
that
the
regulations
are
inherently
illegal
in
and
of
themselves
under
a
facial
attack
to
the
regulations.
it
is
just
as
they
were
applied
to
our
property.
many
of
the
arguments
raised
by
mr.
estes
during
his
argument
will
not
be
responded
to
except
as
the
court
requires
because,
quite
frankly,
our
position
is
that
these
issues
have
already
been
determined
by
the
jury
and
have
been
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
after
a
full
review
of
the
record,
and
there
was--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--no,
your
honor.
if
the
court's
question
goes
to
the
deliberative
process
of
the
agency,
i
think
that--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--well,
your
honor,
my
response
to
that
would
be
no,
and
under
the--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--if
you
take.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
that
would
be
our
position,
your
honor.
again,
the
facts
in
this
case
aren't
precisely
like
that,
so
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
to
reach
a
holding
in
hamilton's
favor,
but
to
respond
directly
to
the
court's
question,
yes.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
that's
precisely
our
point,
your
honor,
and
the
fact
that--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
number
one,
under
the
concept
of
equitable
loss,
yes,
owens
v.
city
of
independence.
as
in
the
land
use
area,
i
think
that
a
long
line
of
cases
of
this
court
indicate
that
when
there
is
a
denial
of
all
economically
viable
use
of
the
property,
that
there
is
a
taking,
and
the
time
for
measuring
that
taking--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--no,
because
number
one,
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
self-executing,
where
the
government
takes
it,
they've
got
to
pay
for
it.
number
two--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--that's
right.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
for
the
temporary
period
only,
and
the
facts
in
this
case
demonstrate
how
reasonable
that
rule
is.
as
i
have
indicated
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
brennan,
hamilton
bank
suffered
a
number
of
holding
costs
in
connection
with
this.
the
record
indicates
that
it
was
close
to
half
a
million
dollars,
according
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
officers
of
the
bank,
but
they
only
got
$350,000.
our
rule
of
law
would
simply
spread
the
loss
and
not
put
it
on
a
property
owner
when
a
regulation
has
been
implemented
that
destroys
all
economic
value.
and
that
is
a
very
narrow
set
of
cases
that
are
going
to...
where
the
property
owner
is
going
to
be
able
to
come
in
and
prove
total
destruction
of
the
economic
value
of
his
property.
in
response
to
the
questions
that
were
raised
concerning
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies,
we
have
got
several
responses
to
that.
first
and
foremost,
keeping
in
mind...
i
will
start
with
just
a
brief
description
of
the
chronological
process
of
the
administrative
procedure.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
they
were
forbidden
both
by
state
law
and
by
the
federal
constitution
to
the
extent
that
they
were
applied
without
compensation.
now,
they
are
not
illegal--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--okay,
october
2
was
the
denial
of
the
plat.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
october
3,
a
letter
from
the
planning
commission.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
all
1980.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
and
then
on
november
11,
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
board
of
zoning
appeals.
the
planning
commission
sent
representatives,
both
the
county
attorney
and
the
county
planner
showed
up
to
argue
their
case.
they
lost.
on
november
25,
or
26th,
hamilton
foreclosed
on
the
property.
prior
to
that
time,
the
evidence
is
clear
in
the
record
that
the
planning
commission
abided
by
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
decisions.
temple
hills
is
the
only
instance
that
the
record
reveals
where
the
planning
commission
refused
to
abide
by
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
decision.
moreover,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
route
was
taken,
in
1981,
june
of
1981,
moving
forward
in
chronology,
hamilton
submitted
two
plats.
one
plat
was
a
plat
that
had
been
approved
and
reapproved
on
numerous
occasions
between
'73
and
'79.
the
other
plat
was
a
plat
that
was
submitted
in
an
attempt
to
comply
with
the
planning
commission's
request.
at
that
meeting,
june
18
of
1981,
the
planning
commission
turned
down
both
plats
submitted
by
the
planning
commission.
the
county
attorney
was
asked
by
the
developer's
representative
what
do
we
do
next?
do
we
go
to
the
board
of
zoning
appeals?
the
county
attorney
said
we
will
not
listen
to
any
opinion
from
the
board
of
zoning
appeals.
now,
in
addition
there
is--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--well,
no,
no
it
is
not
self-enforcing,
your
honor.
the
only
way
it
can
enforce
would
be
to
pursue
a
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
in
tennessee.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
and
of
course,
it
is
interesting,
as
the
court
noted,
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
decision
in
november
of
1980
was
not
appealed
by
the
planning
commission,
and
yet
they
arguing
evidently
that
we
should
have
done
more
in
our
case.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
go
ahead,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
your
honor,
under
the
traditional
principles
of
eminent
domaine,
you
can't
have
a
partial
taking.
as
to
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
partial
taking
in
the
hypothetical
case
presented
by
your
honor,
that
would
depend
on
an
economic
analysis.
there
might
be
some--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--well,
your
honor,
as
to
that
part
of
the
tract,
there
would
be
a
denial
of
economically
viable
use,
but
whether
or
not
under
those
circumstances
you
would
look
at
the
other
tract,
too,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case
and
whether
or
not
substantial
justice
required
the
court
to
do
that.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
not,
no...
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
that.
as
this
court
noted
in
penn
central,
for
example,
there
was
a
total
denial
of
the
air
space
rights
above
the
building,
but
that
wasn't
a
taking
because
the
owner
had
a
residual
use
in
the
grand
central
station
terminal,
an
economically
viable
use.
that's
not
the
case
here.
we've
got
hamilton...
the
only
property
that
hamilton
owned
was
the
258
acre
tract
that
it
foreclosed
on.
there
were
no
residual
rights,
no
economically
viable
use
in
that
tract.
one
hundred
percent
of
hamilton's
property
was
subject
to
these
regulations,
and
the
economic
impact
was
the
total
destruction
of
value.
i
think
that
distinguishes
hamilton
from
the
hypothetical
of
the
court.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
no,
your
honor.
the
testimony
at
trial
was
that
on
this
258
acre
tract,
when
you
consider
all
the
objections
raised
by
the
planning
commission,
you
could
obtain
67
scattered
building
sites.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
that's
why
i've
tried
to
proceed
from
a
practical
standpoint.
of
course,
any
land
has
some
value,
but
to
develop
those
67
houses,
those
lots,
your
honor,
under
the
requirements
of
the
applicable
zoning
ordinance,
you
would
have
to
put
sewers
in,
underground
utilities,
roads
that
met
certain
specifications,
etcetera.
you
can't
just
go
out
and
build
a
house
out
in
the
middle
of
that
property.
you
would
have
to
meet
the
planning
commission's
own
requirements.
the
cost
of
meeting
those
requirements
would
be
approximately
$2
1/2
million,
according
to
the
record,
whereas
the
maximum
that
the
developer,
that
hamilton
could
have
realized
by
selling
those
67
scattered
building
sites
would
be
$1
1/2
million.
so
you
would
wind
up...
any
developer
who
bought
that
property
and
wanted
to
build
those
67
houses
would
have
to
do
so
knowing
that
he
would
lose
a
million
dollars
on
the
front
end.
and
of
course,
nobody
is
going
to
do
that.
no
alternative
uses
were
available.
the
record
is
clear,
it
was
zoned
only
for
residential.
you
couldn't
put
commercial,
agricultural
or
industrial
uses
on
the
property.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
that's
right,
and
the
testimony
at
trial,
uncontradicted,
was
that
hamilton
because
of
that
was
unable
to
sell
the
property
and
because
no
one
was
going
to
pay
anything
for
the
right
to
go
in
and
develop
property
at
a
million
dollar
loss
and
additionally
has
pointed
out
there
were
no
alternative
uses
for
it
and...
in
this
particular
case.
part
of
the
problem
is,
your
honor,
you
can't
just
look
at
it
in
a
vacuum.
the
property
had
been
used
for
six
and
a
half
years
as
residential
property.
a
golf
course
had
been
put
in.
all
of
those
committed
and
locked
hamilton
in
to
a
residential
use
development.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
and
on
a
procedural
due
process
violation,
the
court
directed--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--a
verdict
against,
that's
right,
and
we
of
course
appealed
that.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
for
purposes
of
analysis,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
we
of
course
appealed
that
to
the
sixth
circuit,
but
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
that
issue
was
predominate
by
its
holding
on
the
taking
issue
which
gave
us
all
the
relief
that
we
sought.
on
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
and
state
judicial
remedies,
the
petitioners
argue
that
we
should
have
gone
to
state
court
first.
of
course,
that
isn't
the
law
under
section
1983,
and
we
had
a
right
of
course
to
bring
our
federal
claim,
a
violation
of
a
federal
constitutional
right,
in
federal
court.
and
then--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--we
claim
denial
of
equal
protection,
substantive
and
procedural
due
process
and
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
we
brought
both
a
direct
claim
under
the
fifth
amendment,
a--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
that's
the
only
one.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
in
this
case
i
think
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
as
a
general
abstract
proposition
you
have
to
exhaust
your
remedies
except
from
a
1983
standpoint,
i
am
aware
of
a
lot
of
cases
that
say
that
rule
doesn't
apply,
but
i
think
from
a...
number
one,
normally
yes.
in
this
case,
not
only
did
we
exhaust
our
remedies,
but
it
would
have
been
futile
to
attempt
to
do
anything
more.
hamilton
went
the
extra
mile
simply
to
avoid
going
to
court.
they
couldn't
make
any
money
going
to
court.
the
last
thing
that
they
wanted
to
do
in
this
case...
and
the
record
is
replete
with
references
to
the
fact
that
they
wanted
to
work
with
the
planning
commission
and
avoid
the
expense
of
litigation.
they
can
make
more
money
by
selling
this
property
than
by
bringing
a
claim
in
federal
court.
the
petitioners
argue
the
application
of
the
davis
case,
which
is
a
tennessee
court
of
appeals
decision
cited
in
our
brief,
and
say
that
that
means
that
there
was
an
adequate
state
court
remedy
available.
first
of
all,
our
position
is
that
under
section
1983,
we
can
bring
a
claim
directly
in
federal
court.
secondly,
our
position
is
that
even
if
there
is
some
requirement
that
you
exhaust
state
judicial
remedies,
that...
and
the
justice
department
brief
concedes
on
this
point
that
even
that
is
predicated
upon
the
existence
of
an
adequate
state
court
remedy,
and
in
our
case,
there
is
no
existence
of
an
adequate
state
court
remedy
available.
the
statute
says
on
its
face,
and
i
quote...
this
is
29-16-123,
which
is
the
statute
they
rely
upon...
"if,
however,
such
person
or
company
has
actually
taken
possession
of
such
land,
occupying
it
for
the
purposes
of
internal
improvement,
then
the
owner
can
bring
a
lawsuit.
"
the
davis
case
specifically
refused
to
apply
29-16-123
because
it
said
there
was
no
allegation
or
evidence...
and
i
am
quoting,
"no
allegation
or
evidence
that
the
defendant
government
actually
entered
upon,
took
possession
of
or
used
any
of
the
real
estate
of
plaintiff.
"
so
the
davis
case
actually
supports
our
interpretation
of
29-16-123.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
your
honor.
it
converted
it
to
a
temporary
taking.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
your
honor,
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
to
respond
to
your
question,
the
property...
they...
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
development
has
gone
on
under
1973
standards,
these
same
standards
which
they
find--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
under
1973
standards,
your
honor,
not
under
1979.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
in
ledbetter
v.
peach,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
interpreting
29-16-123,
found
that
that
statute
did
not
apply...
and
i
am
quoting
again...
"in
the
absence
of
a
physical
taking
or
direct
interference
amount
to
a
physical
taking.
"
moreover,
the
issue
of
whether
we
should
have
gone
to
state
court
first
has
been
raised
too
late.
in
an
opinion
by
justice
brandeis
styled
twist
v.
prairie
oil
&
gas
company,
214
u.s.
684,
this
court
in
a
similar
context
found
that
the
petitioners
had
no
right
to
challenge
the
choice
of
forum
at
the
late
date
of
their
argument
to
the
supreme
court.
as
to
the
existence
of
remedy,
i
think
i
have
made
most
of
my
point
to
this
point.
our
position
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
self-executing.
if
the
government
takes
it,
they
have
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
your
honor,
if
you
will
run
that
by
me
one
more
time
again.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
i
understand
that.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
your
honor,
no.
and
in
my
mind,
the
hypothetical
that
you
presented
is
merely
a
diminishing
of
economically
viable
use.
i
don't
see
where
there's--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--right.
well,
i
just...
you
know,
a
total
denial
of
economically
viable
use
in
a
case
like
that
i
think
would
be
very,
very
difficult
to
prove.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
well,
our
position
is
not
just
that
it
was
unprofitable.
i
mean,
it
wasn't
a
case
of
just
breaking
even
or...
and
it's
more
than...
we
couldn't
sell
it.
if
you
analyze
the
traditional
bundle
of
property
rights,
which
this
court
has
referred
to
in
a
number
of
its
decisions
in
this
area,
we
had...
the
right
to
alienate
that
property
was
from
all
practical
standpoints--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--that...
well,
disabled--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--the
record
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
hamilton
tried
to
and
could
not
sell
it.
now--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--well,
it
could
have
sold
it
probably
for
some
nominal
value.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
but--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--no,
that
includes
additional
expenses.
the
economic
analysis
of
our
expert
witness
was
based
on
the
cost
of
construction
as
measured
against
gross
sales.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
no,
your
honor.
it
would
have
been
a
cost
of
constructing
sewers
and
making
additional
improvements
in
the
property.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
your
honor,
that's
my
understanding
of
our
expert's
testimony.
now,
it
appears
in
the
record.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
plaintiffs
should
not
be
specially
privileged
under
the
constitution.
affirming
the
sixth
circuit
would
merely
bring
needed
constitutional
discipline
to
this
area
of
the
law.
the
fifth
amendment
addresses
takings,
not
just
some
takings.
regardless
of
the
mechanics
of
a
taking,
whether
it
be
by
regulation
or
eminent
domaine,
the
fifth
amendment
makes
takings
illegal,
at
least
to
the
extent
they
are
uncompensated.
liberty
and
property
as
so
intertwined
that
one
cannot
have
meaning
without
the
other,
and
under
principles
of
fundamental
fairness,
we
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
not
as
they
were
delivered.
there
was
an
objection
by
the
planning
commission
to
some
of
the
special
interrogatories
submitted
to
the
jury,
but
not
to
the
instructions
on
the
law.
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
there
were
instructions
on--
mr.
g.
t.
nebel
--no
objections,
no,
your
honor.
