mr.
robert
l.
estes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
you
after
the
u.s.
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
trial
court
judge's
granting
of
a
motion
jnov.
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
upon
which
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
concluded
that
the
planning
commission
in
this
case
denied
the
respondent
bank
with
all
economical
viable
use
of
its
property
or
any
economically
viable
use
that
would
constitute
a
taking
requiring
compensation.
to
whatever
extent
the
property
lacked
economic
use
we
say
was
a
function
of
the
property
itself,
its
configuration,
and
the
prior
development
of
that
property.
now,
to
give
you
a
brief
history
of
this,
this
entire
property
consists
of
676
acres
that
was
purchased
by
a
prior
developer
to
the
respondent
herein
to
develop
into
a
cluster
housing
development
around
a
golf
course.
that
was
begun
in
1973,
at
which
time
the
developers
convinced
the
planning
commission
to...
or
actually,
the
county
commission,
to
pass
a
cluster
zoning
ordinance.
this
ordinance
did
now
allow
greater
density
than
one
dwelling
unit
per
acre,
but
it
did
allow
you
to
cluster
dwelling
units
closer
together
provided
you
preserved
enough
additional
open
space
area
within
the
same
development
so
that
you
still
ended
up
with
one
dwelling
unit
per
acre.
now,
this
prior
developer
submitted
a
plat,
a
preliminary
sketch
plat
to
the
williamson
county
planning
commission
in
1973
and
had
it
approved.
that
would
be
one
of
the
two
exhibits
that
have
been
passed
out
to
the
court.
it's
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
at
90...
at
page
422,
exhibit
no.
9700.
now,
at
that
time
there
was
a
two-step
procedure
by
which
a
developer
could
have
plats
submitted
and
approved
by
the
planning
commission.
first,
an
initial
or
preliminary
sketch
plat
would
be
presented
which
contained
just
generally
the
outline
of
the
development,
did
not
contain
extensive
engineering
data.
that
would
be
looked
at
and
determined
whether
or
not
it
generally
complied
with
the
ordinances
and
the
regulations,
and
then
later,
before
a
building
permit
was
to
be
issued
or
the
developer
start
developing,
he
would
have
to
submit
a
so-called
final
plat
either
of
the
whole
development,
if
he
desired,
or
a
section
of
it
if
he
desired
to
develop
only
a
section
of
the
development
at
a
time.
in
this
case,
the
developer,
the
prior
developer,
submitted
only
sectional
final
plats
for
approval.
he
got
about
three
or
four
of
those,
or
three
or
four
sections
approved
through
the
years.
the
subdivision
regulations
in
effect
in
1973
provided
that
though
this
preliminary
plat
was
approved
in
'73,
it
only
lasted
one
year,
that
approval
did.
it
had
to
be
renewed
yearly.
it
was
not
renewed
yearly;
it
was
renewed
several
times.
there
was
a
gap
from
around
1976
through
1978.
then
there
was
a
gap
again
in
august
1980
to
november
1980.
nevertheless,
the
respondent
bank
herein
had
originally
loaned
approximately
$900,000
to
the
original
developers.
through
a
rather
complicated
series
of
events,
this
respondent
bank's
subsidiaries
or
some
of
the
banks
it
was
associated
with,
went
into
bankruptcy
court.
this
bank
then
bought
out
a
greater
interest
through
a
swapping
deal
in
this
subdivision
turned
around...
well,
it
got
title
to
the
property,
the
development
at
that
time,
but
turned
around
and
sold
it
back
to
the
original
developer.
he
kept
it
another
three
or
four
years
until
noember
1980,
at
which
time
he
still
wasn't
able
to
develop
the
property
out,
he
went
under,
and
this
respondent
bank
then
bought
the
remaining
interest
in
this
entire
development
that
had
not
been
fully
developed.
it
did
not
buy
the
original
part
of
the
development.
now,
several
things
occurred
over
the
years
that
changed
the
entire
situation
with
respect
to
this
development
that
the
planning
commission
had
nothing
to
do.
we
say
here
that
the
plat
that
the
respondent
bank
is
relying
on
in
this
lawsuit
that
it
filed
suit
on,
that
plat
it
says
it's
relying
on
complies
with
the
1973
regulations,
and
it
should
be
allowed
to
continue
to
develop
the
rest
of
the
property
with
the
'73
regulations.
actually,
the
planning
commission
had
amended
those
regulations
from
time
to
time.
however,
that
plat
on
its
face
does
not
even
comply
with
the
original
'73
regulations
that
the
respondent
bank
is
claiming
it's
depending
upon.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
the
only
issue
there
was
whether
or
not
the
planning
commission
could
apply
the
amended,
updated
regulations
or
whether
it
had
to
apply
the
'73.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
estes
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
that's
right,
it
did.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
yes,
sir,
there
is.
the
government
plans
to
argue
that
portion
of
it,
but
there
is...
there's
inverse
condemnation
in
the
state
of
tennessee
that
they
could
have
relied
upon.
we
say
they
could
have
sought
judicial
review.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
because
they
still
have
judicial
review,
your
honor,
in
state
court
in
tennessee.
they
never
sought
that.
in
fact,
that
appeal
to
the--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--that's
right,
you're
right.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
at
that
time...
that
was
at
the
time
when
the
prior
developer
submitted
the
october
1980
plan
to
the
planning
commission
and
it
was
rejected.
now,
he
was
immediately
foreclosed
upon
by
the
bank,
so
that
issue
never
got
anywhere.
the
planning
commission
thought
the
bank
would
come
back
and
submit
a
plat
that
did
comply
with
those
regulations,
those
'73
regulations,
and
it
would
be
approved,
and
they
would
go
on
with
the
development.
instead--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--no,
even
though
the
zoning...
the
amended
regulations?
mr.
robert
l.
estes
yes,
that's
right,
but
the--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--no,
no,
your
honor
has
misunderstood
what
i
meant.
it
is
my
fault.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
that's
right.
the
planning
commission
assumed
that
the
new
developer,
the
bank,
that
foreclosed
on
the
prior
developer,
would
come
in
and
present
a
new
plat
that
complied
with
the
'73
regulations.
it
didn't
even
do
that.
it
submitted
another
plat
that
still
didn't
comply
with
any
of
the
regulations.
now--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--thank
you.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
further
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question,
i
would
submit
that
and
point
out
there
was
an
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
tennessee's
opinion
that
was
rendered
shortly
after
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
made
that
decision
which
stated
in
effect
that
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
did
not
have
the
jurisdiction
and
the
power
to
decide
that
general
question
of
law,
and
that
was
relied
upon.
furthermore,
as
mr.
nebel's
letter
points
out,
later
on
in
june
of
'81
to
the
planning
commission,
that
hamilton
recognized
that
it
needed
variances
in
order
for
its
plat
to
be
approved.
that's
contained
in
the
record
at
page
850
of
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
in
this
case.
further--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--they
never
applied
for
them,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
i
was
saying,
your
honor,
that
i
understood
you
to
ask
me
why
the
planning
commission
did
not
appeal
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
decision.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
that
was
the
1980
submission.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
and
the--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--well,
that
earlier
submission
was
not
by
hamilton;
it
was
by
the
prior
developer.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
about
a
month
after
that
submission
and
its
turn-down,
the
hamilton
bank
foreclosed
and
took
over
the
rest
of
the
property.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
hamilton
bank,
the
respondent.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
it
was
turned
down.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
the
board
of
zoning
appeals.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
according
to
the
state
of
tennessee
attorney
general's
report,
no.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
but
there
are
administrative
remedies
that
we
say...
state
administrative
remedies
that
hamilton
bank
could
have
followed
but
did
not,
and
the
government
is
prepared
i
think
to
argue
that
more
fully.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
the
subdivision
regulations
again
in
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
at
page
932
and
933
provide
that
in
order
for
a
variance
to
be
granted,
it
must
be
requested
in
writing,
and
that
without
the
application
of
any
conditions
shown
on
the
plat
which
would
require
a
variance,
would
constitute
grounds
for
disapproval
of
the
plat.
so
the
planning
commission
had
every
reason
to
disapprove
this
plat
simply
because
it
was
submitted
not
in
accordance
with
the
old
'73
regulations
and
without
having
applied
for
a
variance.
now,
going
on
to
the
comparison
of
the
two
plats
that
were
submitted
to
the
court,
there
are
six
major
differences.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
all
right.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
all
right,
because
i
think
we
can
look
at
the
plats,
all
preliminary
plats
that
were
submitted
earlier
as
well
as
the
preliminary
plat
that
the
bank
submitted
in
june
1981
which
was
turned
down,
and
on
their
face
they
obviously
do
not
comply
with
the
regulations,
any
of
the
regulations,
without
a
variance.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
and
the
subdivision
regulations
say
that
that
is
grounds
alone
for
turning
the
plat
down.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
well,
sir,
we
take
the
position
that
they
do
in
this
case
under
the
fifth
amendment
taking
analysis.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
right,
right.
that
gets
into
the...
that
decision
that
i
think
you
are
referring
to,
the
california
decisions.
going
on
to...
if
your
honor
is
finished
with
that,
going
on
to
a
comparison
of
the
plats,
the
preliminary
plat
that
was
submitted
in
1973
and
renewed
several
times
thereafter
but
which
had
expired
before
the
submission
in
october
1980
by
the
predecessor
developer,
and
in
june
of
'81
by
hamilton
bank,
there
are
six
major
differences
in
those
plats.
they
are
just
not
plats
of
the
same
property.
first
of
all,
during
that
interim
the
state
of
tennessee,
by
condemnation,
took
a
portion
of
the
property
in
this
subdivision,
18
1/2
acres
in
the
bottom
right
hand
corner
of
the
plat.
it
is
referred
to
on
the
no.
9702
as
the
natchez
trace
parkway.
that
created
tremendous
problems
for
this
development
to
continue
in
that
area.
it
caused
two
long
prohibited
cul-de-sacs,
one
of
5000
feet
in
length,
the
other
of
3000
feet
in
length,
in
violation
of
all
regulations,
even
the
old
'73
lengths.
cul-de-sac
lengths
were
400
feet
maximum.
they
were
amended
and
actually
liberalized
by
allowing
up
to
800
feet.
here
we
have
two
long
cul-de-sacs
on
the
plat
submitted
by
the
bank
for
the
first
time.
secondly,
or
thirdly,
there
had
been
a
survey
error
by
the
prior
developer
which
was
finally
corrected
by
the
bank
when
it
submitted
its
june
1981
submittal.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
i
don't
think
the
lower
court
rejected
these
claims,
your
honor.
the
lower
court--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--well,
did,
but
i
won
at
the
end
of
the
lower
court
proceeding,
your
honor,
in
that
they
granted
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
there
was
a
survey
error
that
had
occurred
that
showed
up
for
the
first
time
in
october
'80,
in
june
'81
which
took
out
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
plat,
near
the
top,
took
out
several
lots
that
had
theretofore
been
clotted
as
having
been
a
part
of
this
subdivision.
that
changed
the
configuration.
there
were
areas
in
the
original
plats,
five
major
ones,
that
were
clearly
and
unequivocally
marked,
this
parcel
not
to
be
developed
until
approved
by
the
planning
commission.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
ties
right
into
them,
six...
it
ties
into
six
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
six
of
the
eight.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
only
one
question,
as
far
as
i
recall--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--was
considered
by
the
board
of
zoning
appeals,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
planning
commission
had
the
right
to
apply
the
amended
regulations
or
whether
it
had
to
apply
the
1973
regulations.
that
was
the
only
question.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
well,
they
said
you
had
to
apply
the
'73
regulations.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
well,
i
don't
agree
with
it
and
the
state
of
tennessee's
attorney
general
didn't
agree
with
it.
he
said
it
didn't
even
have
the
power
to
decide
that.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
all
right.
we
are
asking
for
a
recital
or
an
opinion
reinstating
the
trial
court's
decision
that
there
can
be
no
taking.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
that
is
not
before
this
court.
that...
all
right,
it
was--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--that's
right.
that
was
appealed
and
a
cross
appeal,
if
your
honor
please,
to
the
sixth
circuit,
but
before
the
case
came
before
the
sixth
circuit,
in
a
compromise
settlement
by
the
bank--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--from
applying
the
seventy...
anything,
any
amended
regulation
after
'73.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
well,
i
think
we
are
forbidden
from
doing
so
under
that
injunction.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
i
don't
necessarily
want
to
live
with
it,
but
we
are
stuck
with
it.
there
was
a--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--well,
that
court
granted
that
injunction
on
state
law
saying
that
we
were
estopped
to
apply
any
later
regulations
to
temple
hills
subdivision.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
we
did,
but
we
say
it
doesn't
matter
because
as
far
as
this
part
of
the
case
is
concerned,
because
that
plat
did
not
even
comply
with
the
'73
regulations.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
that's
right.
the
taking
issue
depends
on
that.
the
plaintiffs
filed
suit
depending
upon
the
'73
regulations
and
the
original
'73
plat
that
was
preliminarily
approved.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
that's
right,
but
analysis--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--that's
right.
but
an
analysis--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--we
were
right.
they
had
no...
we
are
actually
saying,
your
honor,
that
they
had
no
cause
of
action
under
section
1983
and
under
fifth
amendment
taking
theory
because
they
never
submitted
a
plat
that
even
complied
with
the
very
regulations
that
they
were
depending
on
in--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--look
on
the
face
of
these
plats.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
well,
we
are
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
plaintiffs
failed
to
prove
a
fifth
amendment
taking
since
they
failed
to
show
that
they
even
submitted
a
plat
that
complied
with
the
very
regulations
that
they
were
relying
up.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
trial
court
wouldn't
even
rule
on
that
issue.
we
submitted
it
so
many
times
to
him,
in
our
answer,
in
our--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--i
want
to
reserve
about
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
we
are
trying
to
make
the
argument
a
little
bit
differently.
we
are
saying
there
is
not
a
compensatory
taking
here,
there
is
just
a
minor
interference
with
their
development.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
no,
we
maintain
that
there
are
adequate
remedies
under
tennessee
law
as
contrary
to
california
law
where
there
may
not
be
adequate
remedies.
i
am
familiar
with
that.
but
we
have
inverse
condemnation
in
tennessee.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
all
right.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
recollection
of
the
jury's
charge
is
a
little
bit
different
from
mr.
nebel's.
i
don't
recall
the
judge
charging
the
jury
that
if
there
was
any
economical
viable
use
there
was
no
taking.
instead,
i
remember
him
saying
if
they
were
denied
economically
viable
use,
then
there
was
a
taking.
he
did
not
define
how
much
economical
viable
use
would
have
to
be--
mr.
robert
l.
estes
--they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
they
do.
secondly,
we
take
the
position
that
just
because
there
would
be
a
taking
under
this
conduct
if
the
situation
were
be
a
taking
under
this
conduct
if
the
situation
were
permanent
does
not
necessarily
require
a
finding
of
a
compensable
taking
if
it
is
temporary,
particularly
where
the
deliberative
process
is
still
going
on.
and
i
point
out
to
i
appendix
page
370,
plaintiff's
exhibit
9035,
which
is
a
letter
from
the
planning
commission
here
to
mr.
killebrew,
who
was
the
representative
of
the
hamilton
bank,
on
june
23,
1981
with
regard
to
this
turndown
of
this
plat
whereby
he
advises
them
of
the
problems
there
and
tells
them
if
there
is
any
question,
notify
my
office.
staff
will
be
glad
to
work
with
you
and
your
representatives
to
correct
deficiencies
so
as
to
comply
with
the
county
zoning
and
subdivision
regulations.
mr.
robert
l.
estes
thank
you.
