justice
jr.
well,
now,
was
that
issue
before
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
in
that
1980
appeal?
justice
jr.
it
was
not.
justice
jr.
and
the
commission
lost--
justice
jr.
--the
commission
lost--
justice
jr.
--the
zoning
appeals
decided
against
the
commission,
did
it
not?
justice
jr.
is
there
any
issue
in
this
case
whether
any
other
state
procedures
should
have
been
exhausted?
justice
jr.
well,
why
didn't
that
1980
appeal
to
the
zoning
commission
satisfy
any
requirement
of
exhaustion?
justice
jr.
well,
you
lost
in
the
board
of
zoning
appeals,
the
commission
did.
justice
jr.
well,
then,
why
didn't
you
go
to
a
court?
justice
jr.
even
though
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
had
said
those
regulations
were
no
good?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
and
you
still
thought
that
the--
justice
jr.
--this
is
a
case
one
can
get
easily
confused
on
i
might
say.
justice
jr.
did
it
apply
for
them?
justice
jr.
what
was
it
you
were
saying
just
before
lunch,
that
something
had
been
submitted
to
the
court?
justice
jr.
yes,
that
was
the
1980
one.
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
was
there
a
later
submission,
that's
why
i...
by
hamilton,
or
by
anybody?
justice
jr.
right.
justice
jr.
and
who
made
the
second
submission?
justice
jr.
and
it
was
turned
down.
justice
jr.
now,
did
hamilton
bank
go
to
the
planning
board...
or
not
the
planning
board,
i
mean
the--
justice
jr.
--yes.
justice
jr.
would
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
have
had
jurisdiction
entertained?
justice
jr.
no.
i
see.
justice
jr.
yes.
all
right,
thank
you.
justice
jr.
before
you
get
to
that--
justice
jr.
--why
is
it
you
say
that
the
failure
to
ask
for
a
variance
ends
this
case
for
the
bank?
justice
jr.
and
they
never--
justice
jr.
--well,
now,
what
about...
this
is
a
1983
suit,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
what
about
the
principle
that
the
plaintiff
in
a
1983
suit
does
not
have
to
exhaust
various
state
remedies?
justice
jr.
on
the
grounds
if
there
is
a
remedy
there
can
be
no
taking,
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
well,
now,
the
lower
courts
now
must
have
rejected
all
these
claims
of
these.
justice
jr.
well,
how
many
were
considered
by
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
in
november
of
1980?
justice
jr.
only
one
of
the
eight?
justice
jr.
and
what
did
they
say?
justice
jr.
and
you
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
jr.
now
you
are
submitting
it
here?
now
you
are
submitting
it
here.
for
the
first
time.
mr.
estes,
the
warning
light
is
on.
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
you
are
about
eating
into
some
other
time.
justice
jr.
and
also,
i
gather,
mr.
kneedler,
you
say
that
also
precludes
any
finding
of
a
taking.
justice
jr.
and
that's
your
basic
question.
justice
jr.
well,
what
about
the
argument
we
just
heard
that
the
attorney
general
has
said
it
would
have
done
no
good
to
go
to
the
board
of
zoning
appeals?
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
jr.
well,
what
do
you
understand
went
to
the
jury?
justice
jr.
how
were
these
$350,000
arrived
at?
justice
jr.
well,
what
were
the
instructions?
were
the
instructions--
justice
jr.
but
if
he
didn't
have
his
taking
claim,
would
he
have
a
due
process?
justice
jr.
as
one
ask,
is
there
a
due
process
claim
here?
justice
jr.
did
the
instructions
that
led
to
that
conclusion
of
the
jury,
did
they
define
a
compensable
taking?
justice
jr.
have
you
any
suggestion
how
the
jury
arrived
at
$350,000?
justice
jr.
the
what
costs?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
and
your
client
was
content
with
that?
justice
jr.
well--
justice
jr.
and
if
it's
only
temporarily?
justice
jr.
they
still
have
to
pay.
justice
jr.
the
temporary
amount.
justice
jr.
could
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
justice
jr.
well,
there's
no
issue,
is
there?
justice
jr.
the
procedural
due
process
issue
is
not
here
now.
justice
jr.
what
constitutes
the
rights
that
you
claim
were
violated?
justice
jr.
do
we
have
anything
except
the
fifth
amendment
claim
before
us
now?
justice
jr.
that's
the
only
one,
isn't
it?
