mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
a
number
of
respects,
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
would
represent
a
substantial
departure
from
established
principles
under
this
court's
fifth
amendment
decisions.
as
an
initial
matter,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it
doesn't
appear
that
respondents
have
ever
alleged
or
proven
that
any
taking
that
occurred
in
this
case
was
without
just
compensation,
because
they
haven't
shown
that
a
compensation
remedy
would
be
unavailable
under
state
law.
to
ignore
this
essential
element
of
a
fifth
amendment
claim
would
be
in
effect
to
convert
the
federal
district
courts
into
claims
courts
for
the
states
by
permitting
them
to
entertain
inverse
condemnations
in
any
case,
even
though
the
state
might
also
provide
an
inverse
condemnation
remedy.
however,
the
submission
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
does
not
relate
to
the
without
just
compensation
aspect
of
the
cause
of
action
but
rather
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
taking
at
all
that
required
the
payment
of
just
compensation.
there
are
four
points
that
are
important
to
us,
and
i
will
identify
them
at
the
outset:
first,
that
there
was
no
taking
in
this
case
because
the
bank
did
not
pursue
procedures
before
the
petitioner
to
either
obtain
a
variance
or
to
seek
to
comply
with
the
applicable
regulations;
secondly,
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
flawed
analysis
in
determining
what
would
be
a
taking
in
the
zoning
context;
third,
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
the
principle
that
unauthorized
conduct
by
agents
of
the
government
such
as
the
application
of
the
wrong
regulation
here
gives
rise
to
a
claim
for
just
compensation
rather
than
being
in
the
nature
of
a
tort
for
wrongful
regulation
that
does
not
give
rise
to
a
claim
for
just
compensation;
and
fourth,
that
no
compensation
was
owed
for
a
so-called
temporary
taking
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
now,
in
answer
to
several
of
the
questions
that
have
arisen
before,
looking
at
the
first
point,
it
does
seem
to
us
that
the
failure
of
the
bank
to
seek
to
pursue
procedures
before
the
planning
commission
does
end
this
case,
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
district
court
passed
on
the
question
of
whether
the
plat
complied
with
the
1973
regulations
only
reinforces
the
conclusion
that
that's
a
matter
for
the
planning
commission
to
decide
in
the
first
instance,
and
in
fact,
the
planning
commission
did
decide
that
the
submission
did
not
comply
with
provisions
that
were
present
in
both
sets
of
regulations,
the
steep
slope
requirements,
the
length
of
the
cul-de-sacs,
the
road
grades,
all
matters
pertaining
to
public
safety
that
are
quite
aside
from
the
density
of
the
residential
units
on
this
piece
of
property.
and
so
the
point
is
that
the
developer
should
submit
his
case
to
the
planning
commission,
and
as
mr.
estes
pointed
out,
counsel
for
the
bank
conceded
that
variances
would
be
required
in
this
case
to
overcome
the
difficulties
with
the
road
grades
and
with
the
length
of
the
cul-de-sacs.
he
simply
wanted
the
planning
commission
to
grant
approval
to
the
preliminary
plat
and
then
he
would
apply
for
variances.
but
in
fact,
the
subdivision
regulations
applied
by
the
commission
say
that
the
variance
has
to
be
applied
for
before
the
preliminary
plat
is
approved.
and
that
alone,
the
absence
of
a
variance
request
is
alone
sufficient
basis
for
rejecting
the
plat.
and
the
idea
that
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
it's
not
that...
it's
not
a
question
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
it
is
not
a
question
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
for
a
completed
violation,
but
just
that
there
is
no
violation
at
all.
and
this
is
the
point
the
court
made
in
the
hodel
decision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that's
a
question
of
state
law
with
respect
to
these
other
issues.
the
only
thing
that
was
before
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
before
was
the
question
of
whether
the
sub...
the
planning
commission
was
required
to
apply
the
1973
regulations.
any
question
of
compliance
with
those
regulation
was
not
before
the
board
of
zoning
appeals.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
on
the
question
of...
there
were--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
quite
difficult
to
determine.
i
think
that
what,
in
effect,
the
way
the
jury...
from
my
reading
of
the
record
and
what
the
jury
was
permitted
to
infer
was
really
damages
on
the
basis
of
lost...
on
the
lost
of
reuse
of
money,
that
whatever
amount
that
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
only
instructions
on
the
question
of
taking
are
whether
the
landowner
had
been
denied
the
economical...
the
economic
viable
use
of
this
property.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
saying
yes,
and
then
the
question
of
damages
went
separately.
there
were
very...
the
instructions
on
the
question
of
compensation
were
not
very
detailed,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
i
can
discern
as
to
how
those
damages
were
computed.
the
idea
that
administrative
remedies
have
to
be
pursued
ties
in
with
the
notion
of
a
taking
because
a
taking
occurs
in
the
regulatory
context
only
when
the
government
has
deprived
the
owner
of
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
benefit
of
the
use
of
his
property,
and
that
doesn't
occur
just
because
an
agency
has
not
approved
a
particular
proposal
for
development,
as
was
the
case
in
penn
central.
the
court
pointed
out
that
yes,
the
developer
may
not
be
able
to
build
a
50-story
building,
but
he
might
be
able
to
build
a
20-story
building,
and
that
only
when
it
is
clear
that
the
agency
is
not
going
to
permit
any
substantial
development
is
the
taking
claim
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
now,
that's
a
question
of
state
law
that
i
think
is
not
of
principal
interest
to
us.
it
does
seem
to
us,
though,
that
the
nature
of
the
jury
verdict--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
that
respect...
and
it
ties
in
to
another
one
of
our
points,
that
the
commission
was
unauthorized
to
do
that.
they
were
not
authorized
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
apply
the
1981
regulations,
and
that
flies
in
the
face
of
the
established
principles
of
this
court
in
hooe,
in
north
american
company.
it
was
reflected
in
dames
&
moore,
that
unauthorized
conduct
by
agents
of
of
the
sovereign
is
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
we
are
not
suggesting
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
there
can
never
be
a
taking
if
the
agency
acts
properly.
the
state
legislature
could
in
some
states
authorized
a
zoning
board
or
a
planning
commission
to
adopt
regulations
that
would
go
so
far
as
to
constitute
a
taking.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there's
not...
there's
not
a
taking
giving
rise
to
the
self-executing--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
as
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
it's
something
that
sounds
in
tort
more
than--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
might
have
a
due
process
claim,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
not
before
this
court.
the
jury
directed
a
verdict
on
the
assumption
of
due
process
claim,
and
if
a
damage
remedy
were
available,
it
wouldn't
be
because
of
the
self-executing
aspect
of
the
fifth
amendment
but
perhaps
because
of
a
1983
remedy
where
congress
has
created
a
damage
remedy
where
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
require
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
yes,
we
are
not
arguing
that
regulations
can
never
constitute
a
taking.
our
only
point
is
that
compensation
isn't
due
unless
the
legislature
has
authorized
the
agency
to
do
this.
we
point
out
that
there
is
a
provision
of
the
strip
mining
act
which
is
construed
not
to
permit
a
denial
of
a
permit
to
mine
where
it
would
result
in
a
taking.
in
that
instance
you
couldn't
have
a
taking
claim
because
the
agency
isn't
authorized
to
apply
it,
so
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
would
be
to
bring
an
injunctive
action
or
to
seek
apa
review
of
the
denial
of
the
permit
in
those
circumstances.
i
also
wanted
to
briefly
address
what
we
see
as
two
flaws
in
the
takings
analysis.
the
first
is
the
notion
of
vested
rights
that
the
bank
addresses.
vested
rights
does
not
mean
property
rights.
it
is
a
term
of
art
in
the
zoning
area
which
means
as
a
matter
of...
when
as
a
matter
of
state
law
a
development
has
proceeded
to
a
certain
extent,
state
law
permits
them
to
complete
the
development.
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
a
property
right.
when
the
government
grants
a
license
or
a
permit,
it
is
not
purporting
to
confer
a
property
right
on
someone,
and
ordinarily
the
permit
could
be
revoked,
and
in
fact,
in
the
very
case
that
the
bank
relies
on
in
this
case,
schneider
v.
lazarov,
from
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
said
that
very
thing
with
respect
to
building
permits
in
tennessee.
if
a
building
permit
is
granted,
it
can
be
revoked
without
automatically
giving
rise
to
the
claim
for
just
compensation.
so
the
mere
fact
that
the
bank
once
had
approval,
even
if
it
were
so,
for
736
units,
does
not
forever
give
it
a
permanent
exemption
from
the
application
of
changes
in
the
zoning
ordinance.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that
would
depend
on
the
particular
statutory
scheme.
i
think
under
the
federal
system
congress
could
prescribe
that
apa
review
would
have
to
be
sought
for
the
denial
of
a
permit,
and
that's
particularly
so
where
the
agency
was
not
authorized
to
engage
in
conduct
that
would
constitute
a
taking.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that's
less
clear.
i
think
it
tends
to
blend
in
with
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
abstention
on
the
state
law
question
of
whether
the
commission
had
properly
applied
state
law.
it
does
seem
strange
that
that
should
be
something
for
a
federal
court
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
which
set
of
regulations
should
be
applied.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
