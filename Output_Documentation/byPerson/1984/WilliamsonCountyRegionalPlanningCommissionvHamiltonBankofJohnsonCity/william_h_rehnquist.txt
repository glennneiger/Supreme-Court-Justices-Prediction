justice
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
rule
on
that
point?
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
either
that
the
plat
did
or
did
not
comply
with
the
1973
regulations?
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
the
government
concede
that
there
could
be
a
taking
in
the
eminent
domaine
sense
where
there
has
been
no
physical
occupancy
of
the
land?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
nebel?
justice
rehnquist
what
holdings
of
this
court
do
you
rely
on
for
the
proposition
that
there
can
be
a
taking
under
the
eminent
domaine
clause
when
there
has
been
no
physical
occupancy
of
the
land
and
no
effort
by
the
government
to
condemn?
justice
rehnquist
what
i
was
asking
you,
what
holdings
of
our
court
do
you
rely
on?
justice
rehnquist
but
didn't
it
find
that
the
property
value
in
those
particular
formulas
had
been
destroyed?
justice
rehnquist
that's
what
the
jury
found,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
the
government,
some
government
agent,
say
a
federal
government
agent,
goes
on
my
land
and
occupies
it.
now,
congress
has
never
authorized
him
to
occupy
it
at
all,
but
he
says
i
am
here
to
take
over
this
land;
it's
no
longer
yours.
now,
does
the
fact
that
he
says
that
and
he
is
an
agent
of
the
government
mean
that
my
property
has
been
"taken"?
justice
rehnquist
right.
justice
rehnquist
no,
no,
i
don't
think
you
answered
that
way.
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
total
destruction
of
value,
are
you
saying
that
not
a
single
house
could
have
been
built
on
that
tract?
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
sound
like
a
total
destruction
of
the
use
of
the
tract.
justice
rehnquist
and
so
you
say
that
because
of
the
requirements
they
imposed
for
selling
lots
would
have
cost
$2
1/2
million
for
67
lots
and
you
could
have
only
sold
the
lots
for
$1
1/2
million,
that
is
a
denial
of
any
economic
use.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
your
client
had
lost
before
the
planning
and
zoning
commission
on
the
issues
you
present
and
never
appealed
to
the
board
of
zoning
appeals?
do
you
think
you
could
have
gone
right
into
federal
court
from
the
decision
of
the
planning
and
zoning
commission?
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
your
$2
1/2
million
that
you
say
you
would
have
had
to
pay
to
meet
the
requirements
of
these
lots,
is
that
just
in
expenses
over
and
above
what
you
had
already
paid
for
the
land,
or
does
that
include
the
basic
price
that
you
had
paid
for
the
land?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
now,
does
that
$2
1/2
million
figure
include
the
price
you
paid
for
the
land
as
well
as
the
price
of
putting
the
requirements
on?
justice
rehnquist
and
it
is
those
additional
improvements
that
account
for
all
of
the
$2
1/2
million.
