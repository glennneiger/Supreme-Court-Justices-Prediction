justice
stevens
can
i
ask
just
one
question,
if
i
may?
justice
stevens
do
you
argue
that
even
if
there
is
a
taking
under
these
regulations,
that
nevertheless
there
should
not
be
monetary
damages?
do
you
make
that
argument?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
do
you
concede
that
if
there
was
a
taking,
that
it
would
not
be
an
adequate
remedy
just
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
regulation?
justice
stevens
mr.
nebel,
can
i
ask
you
to
move
on
to
your
second
point,
which
is
the
one
that
interests
me
most
in
the
case?
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical.
suppose
you
got
a
case
where
nobody
really
questions
the
fact
that
some
attempt
at
zoning
regulation
or
government
restrictions
would
deny
the
owner
of
the
property
all
viable
use
of
the
property,
but
there
is
a
good
argument
for
doing
it,
environmental
concerns
and
all
the
rest,
and
it
takes
five
years
to
litigate
the
question,
with
procedural
fairness
all
the
way
along
the
line,
appeals
up
to
this,
and
eventually
the
property
owner
wins,
and
then
the
government
says
okay,
you
can
get
an
injunction
against
further
interference
with
that
property.
does
it
automatically
follow
under
your
theory
that
there
are
damages
for
temporary
taking?
justice
stevens
can
there
be...
what
i
am
asking
you
is
can
there
be
governmental
denial
of
all
viable
use
of
a
property
owner's
property
for
a
period
of
time
that
it
takes
to
find
out
whether
it
is
unlawful
or
not
without
there
being
a
compensable
taking,
in
your
view,
and
if
so,
why
isn't
that
what
this
case
is?
justice
stevens
because
if
you
always
have
to
pay
if
you--
justice
stevens
--if
you
deny
total
use
of
the
property.
justice
stevens
so
that
any
time
the
government
wants
to
take
action
that
extreme,
it
litigates
at
the
peril
of
paying
damages
for
the
temporary
interference
with
the
property.
justice
stevens
has
any
case
suggested
that
other
than
justice
brennan's
decision
in
the
san
diego
case?
is
there
my
precedent
for
that
view?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
then
the
question
is
the
remedy.
is
it
an
adequate
remedy
just
to
enter
an
injunction
say,
well,
you
cannot
impose
that
restriction
anymore?
justice
stevens
mr.
nebel,
can
i
ask
you
another
one?
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
if
you
are
not
finished
with
your
point,
but--
justice
stevens
--i
had
another
question
following
up
on
the
problem
that
still
troubles
me
somewhat.
can
there
be
a
partial
taking
under
your
view?
say
that
the
zoning
board
said
you
can't
use
the
east
half
of
the
tract,
you
must
keep
it
vacant,
and
then
you
litigated
that
for
five
years,
you
finally
said,
no,
you
can
build
on
the
east
half
as
well
as
the
west
half,
would
your
theory
apply
to
that?
justice
stevens
no,
but
you
would
say
that
the
part
that
you
are
referring
to,
the
east
half
of
this
large
tract,
must
be
entirely
vacant
and
cannot
be
used
for
any
commercial
or
residential
purpose
whatsoever
because
of
interest
in
open
areas
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff,
and
you
have
litigated
that
and
say
no,
we
are
entitled
to
use
that.
wouldn't
that
be
a
clear
case
of
a
complete
denial
of
economic
use
of
that
part
of
the
tract,
and
therefore
wouldn't
you
theory
apply?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principle
for
which
you
contend
could
be
applied
to
almost
any
aspect
of
zoning
regulation.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
think
through.
you
say
you
can't
build
or
can't
build
above
a
certain
height
or
can't
build
on
a
certain
area,
you
are
totally
taking
to
the
extent
that
the
restriction
applies.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
just
one
other
question.
justice
stevens
as
i
understand,
there
was
a
finding
of
no
substantive
due
process
violation.
was
there
also
a
question
of
whether
there
was
any
procedural
due
process
violation?
justice
stevens
a
verdict
against.
justice
stevens
we
assume
that
there
were
total
fair
procedures
all
the
way
through,
then,
for
purposes
of
analysis.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
on
this.
in
thinking
back
to
some
of
the
old
rate
cases
where
a
commission
sets
the
utility
rates
at
a
low
level,
then
they
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court,
and
the
state
supreme
court
says
no,
that
is
a
taking
without
due
process
of
law,
the
rates
are
too
low,
they
can't
use
their
property,
and
they
reverse
and
require
that
the
new
rates
be
put
into
effect,
would
the
utilities
always
be
able
to
get
damages
from
the
lower
commission
in
those
cases?
i
think
they
would
under
your
view.
justice
stevens
well,
there
used
to
be...
there's
not
too
much
of
this
litigation
anymore,
but
you
know,
public
utility
commissions
regulate
utility
rates,
electric
companies,
telephone.
justice
stevens
and
supposing
the
commission
sets
a
rate
level
that
is
so
low
that
on
appeal
the
company
is
able
to
persuade
the
state
supreme
court
that
there
was
a
taking
without
due
process
of
law
because
the
rate
was
so
low
they
couldn't
have
any
economically
viable
use
of
their
capital,
would,
in
a
case
like
that...
i
understand,
then
of
course,
the
supreme
court
would
say
no,
you
have
got
to
let
them
charge
the
higher
rate...
would
the
company
also
be
entitled
to
damages
from
the
commissioners
who
set
the
wrong
rate?
justice
stevens
well,
the
theory
of
the
rate
regulation
often
was
that
it
was
a
taking
without
due
process.
justice
stevens
well,
you
have
to
operate
at
a
loss,
just
as
your...
your
taking
here
is
not...
you
know,
you
could
still
sell
the
67
houses,
but
your
point
is
you
would
lose
money
if
you
did.
so
it
is
a
taking
in
the
sense
that
it
is
an
unprofitable
use
of
the
property,
and
any
time
regulation
causes
a
citizen
to
make
unprofitable
use
of
his
property,
why
would
it
not
be
a
taking
that
would
give
rise
to
this
very
kind
of
claim
you
have
here?
justice
stevens
but
it
really
wasn't.
i
mean,
you
could
have
sold
it.
you
would
have
lost
money
selling
it,
but
you
were
not
disabled
from
selling
it.
justice
stevens
the
test
really
is
whether
you
can
make
any
money
out
of
what
you
want
to
do
with
your
property.
justice
stevens
well,
could
not
sell
it
at
the
price
it
wanted.
you
could
have
sold
it
at
$10
an
acre,
i'm
sure.
justice
stevens
sure.
