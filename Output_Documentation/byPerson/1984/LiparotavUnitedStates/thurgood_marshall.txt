justice
marshall
is
there
any
way
of
purchasing
food
stamps?
justice
marshall
so
he
starts
off...
he
knew
he
was
doing
something
wrong
when
he
purchased.
justice
marshall
hmm?
justice
marshall
your
complaint
is
lack
of
your
instruction?
is
that
your
only
complaint?
justice
marshall
you
didn't
ask
for
that,
did
you?
justice
marshall
you'd
want
more.
justice
marshall
i
thought--
justice
marshall
well,
you
don't
get
into
all
of
these
isolated
cases
like
the
sullivan
law
in
new
york,
which
is
absolute
liability
for
possessing
a
weapon,
and
they've
lived
with
that
for
30,
40,
50
years.
justice
marshall
and
nobody's
had
too
much
trouble
with
that.
justice
marshall
it's
been
upheld,
and
i'm
talking
appreciably
in
new
york
nobody
raises
any
question
about
it.
justice
marshall
and
some
people
are
completely
innocent.
in
one
case
a
woman
picked
up
the
gun
on
a
subway,
and
she
just
put
it
in
a
paper
bag
and
carried
it
to
the
precinct.
and
the
sergeant
said
wait
a
minute,
locked
up.
she
got
out.
justice
marshall
how
would
it
help
you
if
you
used
stolen
money
orders
in
place
of
the
food
stamps
in
justice
stevens'
question?
justice
marshall
a
federal
statute
of
having
stolen
money
orders?
you
know
of
no
such
statute?
justice
marshall
you'd
better
hurry
up
and
pass
one.
justice
marshall
well,
all
they
were
were
money
orders.
nobody
told
him
they
were
stolen.
justice
marshall
nobody
told
him
they
were
stolen.
justice
marshall
how
does
that
affect
your
client?
justice
marshall
did
your
client
get
those
regulations?
justice
marshall
of
course
not.
he
wasn't
interested
in
them,
was
he?
