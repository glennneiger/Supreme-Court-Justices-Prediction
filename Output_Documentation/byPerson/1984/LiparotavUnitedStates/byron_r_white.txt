justice
white
well,
do
you
think
it's
a
fair
argument
to
say
that
in
most
of
the
cases,
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
like
this,
the
defendant
would
know,
he'd
actually
know
that
he
was
doing
something
wrong?
justice
white
and
the
government
says
well,
so
why
should
we
put
the
prosecutor
up
to
have
him
prove
it
in
every
single
case.
and
so
you're
saying
you
would
concede
that
if
it
were
clear
that
congress
intended
this
to
be
a
nonspecific
intent
case
that
you
wouldn't
have
any
leg
to
stand
on.
justice
white
do
you
think
it's
accurate
to
call
this
a
strict
liability
case?
justice
white
that
the
government...
if
the
government
wins,
do
you
think
it's
a
strict
liability
case?
justice
white
yeah,
i
agree.
justice
white
i
agree
with
you.
justice
white
yes,
but
he
wouldn't
commit
a
crime
if
he
didn't...
the
envelope
comes
in
the
mail;
he
doesn't
open
the
envelope.
justice
white
he
just
tears
it
up.
justice
white
he
says
this
is
junk
mail;
i'll
tear
it
up.
he
just
happens
to
be
tearing
up
food
stamps.
justice
white
well,
he
could
probably...
and
you
might
have
a
tough
time
proving
that
he
intended
or
knowingly
received
food
stamps,
if
all
he
did
was
get
it
in
the
mail
and
open
the
envelope.
