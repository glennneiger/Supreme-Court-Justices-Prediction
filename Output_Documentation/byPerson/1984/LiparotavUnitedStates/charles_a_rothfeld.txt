mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
one
of
justice
white's
questions
suggested,
the
dispute
in
this
case
is
not
about
whether
section
2024(b)
contains
a
scienter
element
of
some
sort.
neither
of
the
proposed
readings
of
the
statute
would
impose
strict
or
absolute
liability.
under
either
reading
the
prosecution
will
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
that
he
was
handling
food
stamps
and
was
aware
of
the
nature
of
his
activities.
neither
reading
of
the
statute
would
permit
a
defendant
to
be
convicted
for
accidental
or
inadvertent
conduct.
and
this
is
a
significant
limitation
on
the
reach
of
section
2024(b),
because
it
means
that
only
defendants
who
were
aware
that
they
were
engaging
in
certain
types
of
foodstamp
transactions,
which
is
the
type
of
activity
that
almost
everyone
realizes
is
subject
to
some
sort
of
federal
regulation,
only
a
defendant
of
that
sort
would
be
subject
to
conviction.
so
the
dispute
here
is
a
narrower
one:
whether
in
addition
to
these
other
limitations
in
the
statute,
congress
wanted
to
take
the
further
very
unusual
step
of
excusing
a
defendant
whenever
the
government
is
unable
to
establish
its
familiarity
with
the
law.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
would
have
to
be
aware
that
he
was
aware
of
the
nature
of
his
action
and
what
he
was
doing,
that
he
was
using
or
acquiring
it,
and
that
they
were
food
stamps.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
simply
that
he
was
conscious
of
his
activity
with
that,
and
so
that
any
accidental
conduct
would
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
but
basically
i
think
what
you've
described
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
in
the
situation
that
you
describe
the
language
of
the
verbs
in
the
statute
impose
some
type
of
limitation
as
well.
it's
not
clear
that
person
would
have
acquired
a
stamp
within
the
meaning
of
section
2024(b).
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
it's
conceivable
that
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
there
is
little
interpretation
of
the
verbs
in
the
statute.
i
think
someone
who
obtains
a
stamp
as
you
describe
it
and
keeps
it,
has
acquired
the
stamp.
it
is
in
his
possession,
and
he
has
acquired
it.
i
think
someone
who
picks
a
stamp
up
on
the
street
or
finds
it
in
his
pocket
and
throws
it
away
or
gives
it
to
the
department
of
agriculture
perhaps
does
not
acquire
the
stamp.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
he--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
i
should
add
that
that
might
also
very
well
be
true
under
the
petitioner's
proposed
reading
of
the
statute,
so
long
as--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--then
he
would
not
have
committed
a
crime.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct.
but
he
would
not
know
that
he
was
doing
it
to
food
stamps,
which
is
an
element
of
the
statute
under
either
reading.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
he...
if
he--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--knew
they
were
food
stamps,
justice
rehnquist.
if
he
simply
looked...
if
it
didn't
register
on
him
that
they
were
food
stamps,
or
he
hadn't
seen
food
stamps
and
didn't
know
what
they
were,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
conviction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
white.
and
again,
to
the
extent
that
such
a
person
could
be
prosecuted,
it
is
likely
that...
well,
there
is
some
possibility
that
he
would
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
either
reading
so
long
as
he
was
aware...
if
he
happened
to
be
familiar
with
the
food
stamp
regulations,
but
did
not
know
that
it
was
a
crime
to
tear
up
an
excess
food
stamp,
he
would
nevertheless,
under
the
petitioner's
reading,
be
subject
to
prosecution,
because
the
line
that
would
be
drawn
under
the
petitioner's
reading
is
not
one
between
people
who
are
in
some
sense
morally
culpable
and
people
who
are
not.
it's
simply
a
line
between
people
who
are
familiar,
happen
to
be
familiar
with
the
contents
of
food
stamps.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
situation
arises
with
any
frequency,
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
want
to
cover,
i
think,
the
situation--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
and
i
think
the
situation
in
this
case
is
an
example
of
the
type
of
people
who
realistically
would
fall
within
the
reach
of
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
there
are
several
responses
to
that,
justice
stevens.
first,
the
type
of
thing
that
the
court
was
doing
in
gypsum
was
preventing
the
offense
from
really
being
almost
a
true
strict
liability
offense.
the
court
in
gypsum
did
not
require
that
the
defendants
be
aware
that
their
activities
were
a
violation
of
law.
it
simply
required
that
they
be
aware
that
their
activities
would
have
the
prohibited
effect
of
inhibiting
competition,
which
is
analogous
to
the
type
of
requirement
we
are
contending
for,
that
the
defendant
be
aware
that
he
is
engaging
in
transactions
involving
food
stamps.
i
think
gypsum
did
not
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
did
not
take
the
further
step
of
requiring
proof
of
familiarity
with
the
requirements
of
the
statutory
scheme,
which
would
be
a
very
unusual
thing
for
the
court
to
do.
as
the
court
put
it
in
the
international
minerals
case,
which
is
probably
the
case
most
similar
to
this
involving
interpretation
of
a
similar
statute,
that
the
general
principle
to
be
applied,
termed
a
rule
in
the
international
minerals
case,
is
ignorance
of
the
law
does
not
excuse
misconduct.
and
that
is
the
type
of
requirement
that
the
petitioner's
contending
for:
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
regulations
and
what
those
regulations
provide.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
absolutely.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
the
court
has
repeatedly
upheld
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
the
court's
cases
have
consistently
upheld
the
validity
of
statutes
such
as
the
one
you've
described
in
which
knowledge...
certainly
knowledge
of
wrongdoing
and
in
some
cases
knowledge
really
of
any
sort
is
not
required.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
that's
not
correct,
justice
brennan.
subsection
(c)
is
aimed
at--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--certainly
they
have
acquired
or
possessed
them,
but
it
would
not
necessarily
be
in
a
manner
not
authorized
by
law.
and
to
give
you
an
example,
if
a
grocer
operates
a
large
grocery
store
with
many
clerks
who
are
taking
food
stamps,
the
clerk
takes
the
food
stamp
in
exchange
for
an
item
that
he
knows
is
an
improper
one,
so
he
has
committed
a
violation.
but
the
proprietor
of
the
store,
the
person
who
is
actually
going
to
present
the
stamp
for
redemption,
would
have
no
idea
that
the
stamp
had
been
accepted
in
improper
manners.
so
far
as
he
knows,
it's
collected
in
the
normal
course
of
business.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
under
(c),
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
he
was
not--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
it
would,
your
honor,
because
he
would
not
be
the
individual...
we
don't
contend
that
subsection
(b)
implies
respondeat
superior
liability
on
the
proprietor
of
the
food
store
who
does
not
himself
accept
the
stamp.
it
has
to
be
someone
who
knowingly
accepted
the
stamp,
and
i
think
that
is
the
grocer
who
accepts
it.
the
proprietor
who
then
finds
the
stamp
in
his
possession--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i'm
not...
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
transaction
between
you,
you
as
the
owner
of
the
food
store,
and
your
clerk
is
one
that
is
authorized
by
law.
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
thing,
a
clerk
who
accepted
a
food
stamp
from
someone
who
had
stolen
it,
for
example,
and
then
went
into
a
food
store
and
engaged
in
a
permissible
transaction,
that
clerk
would
not
be
subject
to
liability
because
the
manner
of
the
transaction
was
an
authorized
one.
it
would
be
the
individual
who
acquired
the
food
stamp
in
the
improper
way
who
would
be
subject
to
prosecution.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
you
certainly
couldn't
go
ahead
and
sell
them
if
you--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i...
the
manner
in
which
the
grocer
is
redeeming
them...
he
has
accepted
them
in
the
normal
course
of
business
and
is
presenting
them
to
an
institution
which
is
authorized
to
redeem
them
for
him,
and
this
is
all
in
a
manner
that
is
authorized
by
law.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i'm
not
sure
actually
in
that
case,
justice
stevens,
what
the
remedy
would
be,
whether
the
remedy
would
recognize
the
grocer--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
no.
under
our
interpretation,
the
grocer
would
not
go
to
jail.
people
who
improperly
acquired
the
food
stamps
in
the
first
place
would
go
to
jail.
and
i
think
that
in
fact
that
the
structure
of
subsection
(b)
and
(c)
provides
significant
support
to
our
interpretation
of
the
statutes.
congress
obviously
intended
there
to
be
some
sort
of
distinction
between
the
reach
of
the
two
statutes.
the
two
statutes
are
written
at
the
same
time,
and
both
are
obviously
addressed
to
the
misuse
of
food
stamps.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
he
would
be
liable
under...
certainly
in
your
first
instance
our
position
is
that
you
would
not
be
liable
under
(b),
because
the
manner
in
which
he
had
acquired
them
was
an
acceptable
transaction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
let--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
the...
well,
i
think
to
answer
your
second
question
first,
yes,
i
think
he
would
be
at
that
point,
because
he
would
know
that
he
was
possessing
them.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no.
well,
i
don't
think
that's
so,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
critical
phase
from
our
perspective
is
acquisition
in
a
manner
not
authorized
by
law.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
grocer
accepted
the
food
stamps--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
either
of
those--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
in
the
instance
in
which
he
has
no
knowledge
of
any
sort
except
that
he
has
food
stamps--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
he
knows
that
he
possesses
them.
i
think
he
would
not
be
liable
under
subsection
(b)
under
our
analysis
of
the
statute,
because
again
i
return
to
the
phrase
he
has
accepted
them
in
a
manner
authorized
by
law,
which
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i'm
not
sure
there
is
a
federal
statute
which
would--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--certainly,
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
actually
your
hypothetical
demonstrates
our
point.
if
he
knew
that
they
were
stolen
food
stamps,
there
certainly
is
a
statute
which
makes
known
possession
of
stolen
property
illegal;
and
if
he
knew
that
they
had
been
stolen,
then
he
would
be
guilty
under
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
he
had
no--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--in
that
case,
your
honor,
he
would
not
be,
so
far
as
i
know,
guilty
under
any
federal
statute
if
he
had
possession
of
a
property
having
no
knowledge
that
it
was
stolen.
and
i
think
the
difference
in
the
language
of
that
sort
of
statute
and
the
language
of
subsection
2024(b)
is
the
knowledge
element
in
the
statute
justice
marshall
has
used
as
an
example
and
2024(c),
in
each
case
explicitly
makes
knowledge
of
impropriety
the
key
to
conviction.
the
knowledge
element
in
section
2024(b)
which
precedes
the
prohibited
conduct
but
does
not
precede
the
2024(c),
does
not
make
that
type
of
distinction.
and
i
think
that
when
congress
wrote
the
two
statutes...
there's
very
little
discussion
in
the
legislative
history,
justice
stevens,
that
addresses
the
problem
we've
been
discussing,
so
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
congress
focused
on--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it's...
where
we
differ
with
you,
justice
stevens,
is
the
suggestion
that
they
would
not
have
any
idea
that
they
were
doing
some
unlawful.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
in
that
situation
the
boss--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
the
classic
example
of
what
we
say
the
statute
applies
to
is
a
situation
such
as
the
one
here
where
someone...
and
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
i
think
the
difference
is
a
significant
one,
because
your
hypothetical
is
concentrated
on
a
grocer
who
is
a
participant
in
the
food
stamp
program
who
has
authorized
methods
of
acquiring
food
stamps
and
has
acquired
the
stamps
that
you
hypothesized
have
been
stolen
in
the
court--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
that
is
why,
justice
stevens,
we
think
that
congress
made
the
distinction
between
2024(b)
and
2024(c).
in
the
situation
you
hypothesize
the
grocer
who
has
acquired
the
food
stamps
would
be
made
liable
really
under
respondeat
superior
theory.
it
would
be
strict
liability,
because
he
would
have
acted
in
the
normal
course
of
events
in
an
authorized
manner,
which
is
acquiring
these
foods
stamps
from
a
clerk
who
has
presented
them
to
the
grocer.
that
is
authorized
by
the
regulation,
and
he
has
done
that.
he
has
acted
in
an
authorized
manner.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
he
would,
your
honor,
because
possession
is
a
strange
word
within
the
group
of
words
in
the
statute.
there
is
no...
really
no
authorized
manner
in
the
statute
defining
how
to
possess
a
food
stamp.
there
are
descriptions
of
how
to
apply
for
food
stamps,
how
to
use
food
stamps.
but
it's
difficult
to
say
that
someone,
once
having
acquired
a
food
stamp,
is
possessing
it
in
a
manner
that
is
or
is
not
authorized
by
law.
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
problem
is
why
your
grocer
hypothetical
presents
a
difficulty.
i
think
that
your
suggestion
that
someone
should
not
go
to
jail
for
something
that
they
had
no
control
over
is
taken
care
of
in
most
examples
under
section
2024(b).
someone
who
acquires
a
food
stamp
in
whatever
manner,
say
to
use
the
facts
of
this
case
as
an
illustration,
someone
offers
to
sell
a
food
stamp
to
a
nonparticipant
in
the
food
stamp
program
or
to
a
participant
in
the
food
stamp
program.
that
person,
even
if
the
nonparticipant
has
no
detailed
awareness
of
the
requirements
of
the
food
stamp
act,
nevertheless,
i
think
it
was
the
congressional
view,
and
it
certainly
seems
a
reasonable
view,
that
person
would
have
some
suspicion
that
food
stamps
are
to
be
used
by
low
income
families
and
acquired
by
low
income
families
for
certain
purposes.
certainly
any
reasonable
person
would
realize
that
there
is
some
doubt
about
the
propriety
of
acquisition
of
a
food
stamp
in
that
manner,
which
is
not
true
of
the
grocer
you
hypothesized,
because
he
has
accepted
it
in
a
manner
which
is
authorized
by
law.
he
has
accepted
it
from
his
employee.
i
keep
returning
to
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
your
questions
lead
to
an
important
point,
which
is
the
question
of
will
people
have
any
idea
that
what
they're
doing
is
wrong,
what
they're
doing
is
potentially
punishable
or
subject
to
federal
regulation.
and
i
think
that
the
vast
majority
of
cases
in
which
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
will
apply,
i
think
in
probably
all
cases
that
will
be
true,
certainly
for
a
huge
portion
of
people
who
come
in
contact
with
food
stamps,
which
are
the
participants
in
the
food
stamp
program,
people
who
accept
food
stamps.
they
have
been
informed
by
the
department
of
agriculture,
by
statute
and
regulation
they
must
be
informed
of
all
the
requirements
of
the
food
stamp
program.
so
all
these
people
presumptively
are
aware
of
the
proper
means
for
acquiring
food
stamps
and
are
aware
if
they
acquire
them
in
a
manner
that
is
not
authorized
by
law.
and
as
for
nonparticipants,
it
would
be
extremely
surprising
to
find
that
anyone
has
any
doubts,
anyone
walking
along
the
street
who's
offered
food
stamps,
any
similar
situation
that
that
person
has
any
doubts
that
the
acquisition
of
food
stamps
may
well
be
suspect
and
is
certainly
likely
to
be
subject
to
some
sort
of
federal
regulation.
and
to
the
extent
that
anyone
has
any
doubts
about
that,
the
stamps
themselves
have
enough
tangible
reminders
to,
i
think,
make
anyone
hesitate
before
engaging
in
a
food
stamp
transaction.
they
are
marked
nontransferable.
food
stamp
booklets
carry
the
warning
that
improper
use
is
a
felony.
food
stores
by
statute
are
required
to
post
signs
warning
against
food
stamp
abuse.
and
i
think
given
all
of
these
circumstances,
it
is
reasonable
to
treat
a
person
who
actually
acquires
a
food
stamp
in
some
manner
that's
not
authorized
by
law
as
being
on
notice
that
his
activities
might
be
regulated
and
might
be
suspect.
and
i
think
i'd
return
to
a
point
that
was
alluded
to
earlier,
the
question
if
misignorance
of
the
law
excusing
this
conduct.
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
suggested,
as
justice
marshall's
question
indicated,
that
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
a
regulation,
as
in
international
minerals--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--there's
no
doubt
that
congress
can
and
has
made
awareness
either
of
the
law
or
of
some
legal
attendant
circumstance
an
element
of
a
defense,
and
i
think
congress
did
that,
for
example,
in
2024(c)
where
it
made
knowledge
of
some
type
of
impropriety.
but
generally
when
congress
does
that
it
signals
its
intention
explicitly.
we
cite
a
number
of
examples
in
our
brief
at
page
17
where
congress
has
either
expressly
made
ignorance
of
the
existence
of
some
body
of
regulations
a
defense
to
a
criminal
charge,
or
other
statutes
when
congress
has
wanted
to
make
possession
or
acquisition
of
a
certain
type
of
property
turn
on
knowledge
of
the
law
or
knowledge
of
the
legal
status
of
the
property.
it
has
generally
done
so
by
using...
either
making
intent
to
defraud
an
element
of
the
crime
or,
as
in
2024(c),
by
making
explicit
the
requirement
that
the
prosecution
prove
the
defendant's
knowledge
of
the
type
of
property
he
was
dealing
with.
but
section
2024(b)
does
none
of
those
things.
it's
simply
a
flat
declaration
that
knowing
conduct,
if
not
authorized
somewhere
in
the
food
stamp
laws
or
in
the
implementing
regulations,
is
a
violation
of
law.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
there
is
no
doubt
that
some
type
of
knowledge
has
been
made
an
element
of
the
offense,
but
i
think
the
language
of
2024(b),
if
construed
the
way
petitioner
suggests,
would
lead
to
peculiar
consequences,
given
its
use
of
the
"any
manner
not
authorized
by
law.
"
phrase,
which
is
sort
of
an
open-ended
phrase.
it
would
require
the
prosecution
to
prove,
if
the
requirement
is
taken
literally,
that
the
defendant
knew
that
his
actions
were
not
authorized
by
any
existing
provision
of
the
food
stamp
act
or
of
the
implementing
regulations.
and
has
been
suggested
in
some
circumstances,
some
cases,
the
defendant
will
have
acted
in
such
a
suspicious
or
furtive
way
that
the
jury
will
be
able
to
infer
circumstantially
that
what
he
must
have
known
what
he
was
doing
was
wrong.
but
that
will
not
always
be
the
case,
and
the
facts
here
where
the
defendant
seriously
contended
that
he
was
unaware
of
the
requirements
of
the
food
stamp
law
illustrate
what
can
happen
if
a
knowing
illegality
element
is
read
into
the
statute
given
this
open-ended
language.
and
here
the
defendant
was
involved,
concededly
involved
in
purchases
of
large
quantities
of
food
stamps
for
a
substantial
discount.
that
is
undoubtedly
the
type
of
action
that
most
people
would
suspect
to
be
of
questionable
propriety,
but
it
would
not
be
enough
for
conviction
if
there
is
a
knowing
illegality
element
in
the
statute
that
a
reasonable
person
would
have
doubted
the...
had
doubts
about
the
legality
of
the
defendant's
action
or
that
the
defendant
himself
had
doubts.
the
government
would
still
be
required,
so
long
as
the
defendant
could
credibly
claim
that
he
had
never
read
the
food
stamp
laws
or
been
told
of
their
contents,
the
government
might
well
not
have
met
its
burden
of
proving
that
the
defendant
knew
that
no
provision
of
law
or
regulation
authorized
his
activities.
that
is
a
very
peculiar
burden
to
place
on
the
government,
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision
by
declining
to
read
such
a
requirement
into
the
statute
essentially
has
simply
made
it
impossible
for
individuals
who
engage
in
these
questionable
food
stamp
transactions
to
be
able
to
immunize
themselves
from
liability
by
remaining
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
food
stamp
law
in
the
implementing
regulations.
and
i
should
add
one
very
brief
point
which
i
think
strongly
supports
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
that
is
the
nature
of
the
food
stamp
act
as
a
whole,
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
food
stamp
act
which
impose
an
enormously
strict
series
of
requirements
and
potential
penalties
on
everyone
who
can
be
expected
to
come
in
contact
with
stamps
to
prevent
every
conceivable
misuse
of
food
stamps.
we
set
out
in
our
brief
this
very
fantastically
complex
and
burdensome
series
of
requirements,
and
it's
very
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
imposed
these
burdens
on
everyone
who
might
possibly
have
any
legitimate
reason
to
come
into
contact
with
a
stamp,
and
then
allowed
someone
to
engage
in
what
everyone
would
realize
to
be
a
doubtful
transaction
and
be
able
to
avoid
liability
because
he
never
bothered
to
learn
the
elements
of
the
food
stamp
laws
or
its
implementing
regulations.
the
nature
of
the
food
stamp
act
i
think
also
gives
2024(b)
the
characteristics
that
the
court
has
said
repeatedly
are
typical
of
statutes
in
which
congress
has
not
included
a
knowing
illegality
element.
and
i
think
this
responds
to
your
basic
point,
justice
stevens,
about
the
danger
of
putting
someone
in
prison
who
doesn't
know
what
he
was
doing
was
wrong.
i
think
the
presumption
the
court
has
applied
in
cases
like
gypsum
and
morissette,
when
congress
has
legislated
against
the
background
of
common
law
offense,
it
is
understood,
unless
it
signals
its
intentions
to
the
contrary,
that
it
did
not
mean
to
direct
the
statute
at
anyone
other
than
blameworthy
defendants.
but
that
is
not
necessarily
the
presumption
of
statutes
that
have
no
common
law
analog,
that,
as
justice
blackmun
along
the
court
of
appeals
termed
are
statutes
of
prohibition
rather
than
statutes
of
punishment
that
are
designed
to
prevent
some
significant
regulatory
injury,
and
of
particular
importance,
that
operate
in
an
area
such
as
the
food
stamp
area
where
certainly
anyone
who
comes
into
contact
with
a
stamp
has
a
good
idea
that
there
is
regulation.
these
are
not,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
these
are
not
normal
articles
of
commerce
that
everyone
comes
across
every
day,
and
they
should
be
on
their
guard.
now,
given
the
nature
of
the
food
stamp
act,
which
allocates
with
as
much
precision
as
possible
the
necessary
number
of
coupons
to
individuals
in
need,
any
violation
of
the
act's
requirements,
whether
intentional
or
whether
or
not
the
person
knew
he
was
violating
the
act's
requirements,
will
detract
from
the
achievement
of
the
congressional
purpose
by
necessarily
detracting
from
the
assistance
being
provided
to
the
recipient
household.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
specific
intent
i
think
is
a
confusing
phrase.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
knowledge
that
the
stamps
were
acquired
in
the
manner
described.
he
may
not
know
that
his
redemption
of
the
stamps
acquired
in
that
manner
subjects
him
to
criminal
penalties.
but
we
certainly
acknowledge
that,
because
we
think
congress
was
concerned
with
precisely
the
point
that
we
discussed
at
length
before.
it
did
not
want
someone
who
had
no
reason
to
be
on
notice
that
his
actions
were
suspect
to
be
able
to
be
subjected
to
criminal
liability.
i
think
it
hardly
seems
unfair
in
the
vast
majority
of
imaginable
cases
that
someone
who
is
engaging
in
questionable
food
stamp
transactions
could
be
subjected
to
criminal
penalties.
and
given
the
enormous
complexity
of
the
food
stamp
act
and
the
congressional
purposes,
on
the
crucial
question
of
the
case,
which
is
congressional
intent,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
would
have
wanted
someone
who
engaged
in
a
harmful
food
stamp
transaction
that
he
should
have
suspected
to
be
of
questionable
validity
to
be
able
to
escape
punishment
by
remaining
ignorant
of
the
requirements
of
the
law
and
the
implementing
regulations.
thank
you.
