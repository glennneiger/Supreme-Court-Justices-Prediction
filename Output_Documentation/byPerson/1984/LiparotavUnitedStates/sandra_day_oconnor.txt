justice
o'connor
mr.
huyck,
in
your
view
would
an
instruction
by
the
court
in
this
case
telling
the
jury
that
if
the
defendant
had
reason
to
know
the
stamps
were
unlawfully
acquired,
would
that
have
been
sufficient
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
so
you
don't
think
that
it
requires
actual
knowledge.
you
think
it
should
be
read
as
though
it
said
having
reason
to
know
is
sufficient.
