justice
rehnquist
in
your
view
did
that
mean
the
jury
need
only
find
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
food
stamps
were
food
stamps
and
not
postcards,
so
to
speak?
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
there's
some
bit
of
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
because
if
you're
talking
about
a
prohibition
against
the
sale
of
milk,
milk
is
ordinarily
an
article
of
commerce,
and
you
simply
wouldn't
expect
its
ordinary
milk
sale
to
be
prohibited.
but
food
stamps
are
not
really
an
article
of
commerce.
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
a
potential
defendant
may
be
on
some
notice
when
someone
comes
to
him
with
food
stamps
whether
or
not
they
can
be
acquired.
this
is
not
an
ordinary
commodity
that
someone
comes
into
your
store
and
offers
to
sell.
justice
rehnquist
under
your
analysis,
the
government
would
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
not
only
that
the
defendant
knowingly
acquired
food
stamps,
but
that
he
knew
that
his
acquisition
was
not
authorized
by
law,
is
that
correct?
justice
rehnquist
how
would
the
government
prove
that
second
element?
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
it
entirely
accurate
to
equate
the
term
"knowingly"
and
speak
of
that
as
a
specific
intent?
i
mean
an
intent
is
something...
is
the
intent
with
which
you
do
an
act,
and
knowingly
has
always
struck
me
as
something
a
little
bit
different,
or
either
less
or
more
inclusive
than
the
intention.
justice
rehnquist
could
your
client
have
been
prosecuted
for...
under
the
second
provision?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
there's
no
charge
that
he
presented.
he
was
charged
with
acquiring.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
rothfeld,
in
light
of
the
comment
you
just
made,
under
(b),
someone
who
deals
in
food
stamps
knowing
that
they're
food
stamps,
okay,
can
be
convicted,
can't
he?
he
doesn't
really
have
to
know
much
more
about
it.
justice
rehnquist
now,
you
say
he
would
have
to
be
aware
of
the
nature
of
his
action.
really
all
he
has
to
be
aware
of
is
that
he
was
acquiring...
the
things
he
was
acquiring
were
food
stamps.
justice
rehnquist
any
more
awareness
required?
justice
rehnquist
but
if
he
opened
the
envelope
and
tore
them
up,
then
he
would
be
doing
it.
justice
rehnquist
if
he
knew
they
were
food
stamps.
justice
rehnquist
isn't
there
something
to
the
your
opponent's
contention
at
least
that
isn't
completely
disposed
of
by
saying
it's
an
ignorance
of
the
law
defense;
that
there
the
statute
itself
in
one
of
its
clauses
speaks
of
awareness
or
what
have
you
and
the
fact
that
it's
not
permitted?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
don't
you
think
that
the
language
you're
just
talking
about
is...
when
you
add
to
it
the
language
"in
any
manner
not
authorized
by
this
chapter.
"
is
quite
different
than
just
a
flat
prohibition
that
"whoever
knowingly
uses,
transfers,
acquires,
alters
or
possesses
coupons
or
authorization
cards
in
any
manner.
"
period.
i
mean
there
you
do
have
strict
liability
regardless
of
any
knowledge.
but
when
you
add
to
it
the
language
"not
authorized
by
this
chapter
of
the
regulations.
"
you've
certainly
brought
in
some
kind
of
additional
element.
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
you're
dealing
with
a
statute
where
the
adverb
is
"knowingly".
it
seems
to
me
you
can
very
reasonably
read
the
word
"knowingly"
into
the
second
clause
of
the
statute,
or
you
can
say
there
is
no
intent
requirement,
because
"knowingly"
isn't
found
in
this.
but
how
you
can
say
their
having
reason
to
know,
which
is
nowhere
found
in
the
statute,
i
don't
know.
