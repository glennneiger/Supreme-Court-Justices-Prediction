justice

we'll
hear
arguments
this
afternoon
in
liparota
against
the
united
states.
mr.
huyck,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
congress
was
concerned
about
acts
or
attitudes?
chief
justice
burger
you
don't
think
it
means
that
congress
was
concerned
about
whether
he
knew
what
he
was
doing?
chief
justice
burger
and
don't
you
think
this
instruction
that
was
given
submitted
that
issue
to
the
jury
fairly?
chief
justice
burger
like
purchasing
drugs,
like
purchasing
opium,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
it
isn't
as
clearly.
chief
justice
burger
assume
the
law
was
as
you
suggest,
that
the
government
must
establish
that
proof.
if
on
the
whole
record
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
that
knowledge
was
possessed
by
the
defendant,
then
would
not
the
absence
of
the
instruction
you
request
be
a
harmless
error?
chief
justice
burger
then
the
jury--
chief
justice
burger
--well,
if
on
the
whole
record
it's
perfectly
clear
that
he
did
have
the
knowledge
that
you
say
should
be
shown,
isn't
that
enough?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
someone
sent
it
to
him
in
the
mail
and
he
opened
the
mail
and
found
the
food
stamp,
he
probably
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
anything,
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
four
minutes,
five
minutes
remaining,
mr.
huyck.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
