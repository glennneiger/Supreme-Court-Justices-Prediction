justice
jr.
is
it
agreed
that
(c)
does
require
proof
of
specific
intent?
justice
jr.
well,
you
read
that
as
meaning
specific
intent.
justice
jr.
again,
mr.
huyck,
do
you...
does
one
who
presents
coupons,
a
violation
of
(c),
is
he
somebody
who
has
acquired
or
possessed
coupons
in
violation
also
of
(b)?
justice
jr.
well,
and
if
(c)
requires
a
specific
intent
and
(b)
does
not,
then
why
would
the
government
ever
prosecute
under
(c)?
why
wouldn't
it
always
prosecute
under
(b)?
justice
jr.
well,
then
the
government...
if
that's
so,
the
government
could
prosecute
all
these
cases
under
(b)
because
it
doesn't
require
proof
of
specific
intent.
then
they'd
never
have
to
prove
specific
intent
at
all,
would
they?
they'd
never
prosecute
under
(c).
justice
jr.
only
a
possibility?
justice
jr.
well,
may
i
ask,
if
you
prevailed
today,
i
gather
there'd
be
no
reason
for
you
to
bring
any
more
prosecutions
under
(c),
will
there?
justice
jr.
i
know
what
it's
aimed
at,
but
if
one
presents
food
stamps
for
redemption,
hasn't
one
acquired
or
possessed
them?
