mr.
william
thomas
huyck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
court
with
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
language
of
a
federal
criminal
statute.
the
statute
at
issue,
section
2024(b)
of
title
vii
is
one
of
a
common
type
of
criminal
statute
appended
to
a
statute
of
congress
establishing
a
program...
in
this
case
the
food
stamp
program...
and
providing
for
criminal
prosecution
for
fraud,
and
stating
in
relevant
part
that
whoever
knowingly
acquires
food
stamps
in
any
manner
not
authorized
by
this
chapter
is
guilty
of
an
offense.
and
the
issue
that's
presented
as
to
the
wording
of
this
statute
is,
taking
the
phrase,
again
in
relevant
part,
acquires
coupons
in
any
manner
not
authorized
by
the
chapter,
since
congress
has
chosen
to
use
the
word
"knowingly",
does
the
word
"knowingly"
apply
to
that
entire
phrase;
or,
as
argued
by
the
government,
does
it
apply
to
only
a
portion
of
the
phrase,
namely
"acquires
coupons";
that
in
other
words,
the
offender
knew
he
was
acquiring
coupons,
but
that
he
need
not
know
it
was
in
any
manner
in
violation
of
the
statute.
the
facts
of
this
case
can
be
stated
very
briefly.
the
petitioner
and
his
brother
ran
a
small
sandwich
shop
in
a
poor
neighborhood
in
chicago
which
was
not
a
member
of
the
food
stamp
program.
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
evidence
in
the
record
about
the
enforcement
of
the
food
stamp
regulations
against
food
stores
and
other
participants
in
the
food
stamp
program
which
in
essence
establishes
a
tremendous
amount
of
notice
and
warning
prior
to
undercover
criminal
investigation.
none
of
this
applied
to
the
sandwich
shop
that
petitioner
and
his
brother
ran.
an
undercover
agent
with
a
secret
tape
recorder
came
into
their
sandwich
shop,
having
gone
to
a
food
store
that
she
was
investigating,
the
food
store
having
told
them
that
they
would
not
buy
food
stamps
from
her,
and
then
she
went
to...
but
told
her
try
the
sandwich
shop
down
the
street,
whereupon
she
sent
into
the
sandwich
shop,
offered
to
sell
food
stamps
at
a
discount
to
petitioner
and
his
brother,
and
did
so
on
three
occasions,
whereupon
they
were
prosecuted.
the
issue
that
is
before
this
court
was
raised
in
the
jury
instruction
conference.
the
trial
counsel,
myself,
offered
a
specific
intent
jury
instruction,
the
standard
specific
intent
jury
instruction,
that
he
had
to
be
purposefully
intending
to
violate
the
law.
the
government
objected,
and
the
judge
agreed,
that
this
was
a
strict
liability
offense
as
to
the
element
of
knowledge
of
violating
the
law,
and
thereupon,
the
judge's
instruction
to
the
jury
told
the
jury
in
essence
there
were
three
elements
of
the
offense,
and
he
divided
the
action
element
from
the
knowledge
element.
he
said
that
they
had
to
find
first
that
the
defendant
acquired
and
possessed
food
stamp
coupons
for
cash
in
a
manner
not
authorized
by
federal
statute,
the
act;
and
then
he
said
second,
they
have
to
find
the
defendant
knowingly
and
willfully
acquired
the
food
stamps,
but
not
that
it
was
in
a
manner
in
violation
of
the
regulations.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
yes,
exactly.
and
that...
there
was
a
colloquy
with
the
court,
and
in
fact
the
colloquy
went
so
far
as
my
asking
the
court
can
i
argue
to
the
jury...
my
client
had
testified
in
this
case
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
the
food
stamp
regulations,
and
that
he
did
not
know
that
it
violated
any
regulations
for
him
to
be
buying
these
food
stamps
from
this
undercover
agent.
and
this
was
virtually
the
only
defense
that
he
had
other
than
entrapment,
which
was
also
a
defense.
so
this
took
me
by
surprise
that
this
was
going
to
be
interpreted
not
as
a
specific
intent
crime,
and
so
there
was
a
colloquy,
and
i
asked
the
judge
can
i
argue
that
to
the
jury,
and
the
judge
said
no,
you
cannot
argue
ignorance
of
the
law
in
this
case
to
the
jury.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
i
think
that
congress
in
drafting
the
statute
used
the
word
"knowingly"
for
some
purpose,
and
i
think
that
they...
this
is
a
statute
where
the
element
of
it
being
in
violation
of
the
statute
is
written
right
into
the
words
of
the
statute.
and
so
i
think
that
by
using
the
phrase
"knowingly
acquires
food
stamps
in
any
manner
not
permitted
by
this
chapter,
that
that
is
the
plain
meaning
of
congress.
"
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
no.
that's
precisely
my
point.
they
did
not
use
the
word
"knowingly"--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--it
submitted
the
issue
as
far
as
"knowingly"
goes.
he
carefully
did
this.
he
submitted
the
issue
whether
defendant
knowingly
and
willfully
acquired
the
food
stamps,
period.
and
in
view
of
the
colloquy
that
we
had,
he
was
clearly
intending
to
leave
out
that
he
knew
it
was
in
a
manner
violated
by
the
statute.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
i
am
arguing
for
any
kind
of
an
ignorance
of
the
law
defense
to
a
crime
of
this
kind,
and
i'm
not
even
arguing
for
the
specific
intent
instruction
that
i
offered
at
trial.
that
was
done...
this
issue
came
up
hastily
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
and
i
think
that
fairly...
it
fairly
raised
the
issue.
but
the
issue
that
i'm
arguing
here
is
exactly
the
one
that
was
pointed
out,
if
i
can
quote
some
language
from
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
united
states
v.
freed,
a
concurring
opinion,
"the
definition
of
the
crime
as
written
by
congress
requires
proof
of
circumstances
that
involve
the
legal
element.
"
in
other
words,
this
is
not
a
general
ignorance
of
the
law
defense.
this
is
a
statute
where
there's
a
legal
element
that
is
an
attendant
circumstance,
as
you
will,
of
the
crime.
the
definition
of
this
offense
has
an
element
of
an
act,
acquiring
food
stamps,
and
an
element
of
an
attendant
circumstance,
namely
that
that
acquisition
is
not
in
any
manner
authorized
by
the
statute.
and
you
have,
i
think,
in
the
model
penal
code
a
much
more
reasonable
basis
for
interpreting
criminal
statutes
of
this
kind
than
to
quibble
about
the
way
that
modifying
language
can
be
phrased
in
the
english
language.
and
as
i
tried
to
make
an
example
in
my
reply
brief,
the
results
should
not
just
turn
on
the
fortuitous
way
that
a
phrase
is
turned.
judge
magruder
in
the
st.
johnsbury
trucking
case
that
i
cited
used
the
example
of
adulterated
milk.
if
you
have
a
statute
that
says
whoever
knowingly
sells
adulterated
milk,
people
would
assume
that
that
means
that
you
have
to
know
it
was
adulterated
as
well
as
knowing
that
it
was
milk.
but
if
you
phrased
it
this
way,
"milk
which
had
been
adulterated",
using
a
phrase
instead
of
an
adverb,
an
adjective,
you
should
have
the
same
result.
but
the
government
could
make
the
same
analysis
of
that
language
that
it's
making
here.
it
could
say
that
you
have
"knowingly"
modifying
the
verb
"sell",
and
then
"milk"
is
the
object
of
"sell",
and
the
phrase
"which
has
been
adulterated"
is
a
separate
phrase
modifying
the
verb
"sell"
and
that--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
certainly
am
not
offering
up
milk.
i'm
offering
this
an
example
of
phraseology
in
the
english
language,
and
the
bottom
line
being
i
think
you
ought
to
use,
for
instance,
the
model
penal
code
rule
of
construction
that
if
a
word
such
as
"knowingly"
appears
in
front
of
a
statute,
that
you
assume
that
it
applies
to
every
element
of
the
offense
stated
in
the
statute,
unless
the
contrary
point
intent
plainly
appears.
but
other--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--is
there
any...
no,
there
is
no
legal
way
of
purchasing
food
stamps,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
he
told
the
jury
that
he
didn't.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
but
i
admit
he
had
a
tough
case.
but
he
told
the
jury
that
he
didn't.
and,
of
course,
we're
talking
about
a
statute
here
that
applies
to
the
entire
chapter
and
all
of
the
regulations
issued
there
under.
we're
not
just
talking
about
trafficking
violations.
but
i
certainly
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
that
this
was
a
tough
case
for
the
defendant,
because
purchasing
food
stamps,
there
is
no
legal
way
of
doing
it,
that's
correct.
and--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--well,
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
is
the
same
as
that.
i
think
that--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--i
think
that
when
you're
trying
to
draw
a
line
as
to
which
limited...
and
in
the
u.s.
gypsum
case
the
court
said
there
are
very
limited
circumstances
where
in
the
absence
of
a
term
defining
the
mental
state,
you
will
imply
that
congress
meant
strict
liability
as
to
that
element,
very
limited
circumstances.
and
one
of
them
is
this
line
of
dangerous
instrumentality
cases...
firearms,
drugs
and
so
on...
where
the
court's
analysis
has
been
that
congress
probably
intended
strict
liability
as
that
element
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
items.
and
i
do
not
think
that
food
stamps
are
such
an
item.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
that's
correct.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
well,
it
was
argued
to
the
jury
very
effectively
by
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
incidentally,
enough
the
judge
told
her
that
she
didn't
have
to,
they
said...
she
said
these
transactions
took
place
in
the
back
room.
whenever
she
came
around
to
sell
food
stamps,
he
said
come
in
the
back
room
and
do
it.
on
one
occasion
he
said
to
her
my
brother
doesn't
want
me
dealing
in
these
food
stamps.
he's
scared.
they
were
bought
at
a
discount.
they
had
warnings
printed
on
the
books.
my
contention
here
is
that
the
proof
of
the
so-called
criminal
intent
of
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
no
more
difficult
for
the
government
than
in
any
other
criminal
case.
you're
always
making
arguments
to
the
jury
that
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
show
a
consciousness
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
that
he
knew
he
was
doing
wrong.
and
this
case
was
no
different
than
the
other
cases.
and--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--i
think
so.
i
think
so.
as
long
as--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--oh,
certainly
in
interpreting
a
federal
criminal
statute
if
the
meaning
is
plain,
that
ends
it.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
meaning
is
plain,
and
i
think
that
it's
an
ambiguous...
at
the
very
least
it's
an
ambiguous
statute
to
which
you
should
apply
the
rule
of
lenity.
but
i...
but
think
of
all
the...
i
put
one
example
in
my
brief.
this
statute
can
be
used
not
only
to
prosecute
trafficking.
i
agree
that
a
trafficking
prosecution
is
no
difficulty
for
the
government.
the
government
doesn't
need
strict
liability
because
congress
intended
that
they
use
these
undercover
agents
to
go
to
grocery
stores,
and
that's
what
they
do
for
the
most
part,
and
the
grocery
stores
are
on
notice.
there
would
be
no
difficulty
at
all
proving
actual
knowledge
on
behalf
of
any
grocery
store
because
they
have
all
of
these
warnings.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
well,
strict--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--no.
strict
liability
as
to
this
element
of
the
offense.
i
think
that
we
have
to
be
careful
in--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--using
words
like
"strict
liability"--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--to
talk
about
that
we're
recognizing
that
there
are
different
elements
in
an
offense,
and
we're
talking
about
this
particular
element.
but
to
go
back
to
an
earlier
question,
why...
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
congress
did
not
use
the
word
"knowingly"
here
just
to
say
that
you
couldn't
prosecute
someone
who
did
not
actually
know
that
what
they
had
was
a
food
stamp.
and
that
is
not,
i
submit,
a
very
common
use
of
the
word
"knowingly"
or
"willfully"
in
criminal
statutes.
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
was
the
reason
congress
put
the
word
"knowingly"
in
here.
now,
the
government
points
to
the
following
section,
subsection
(c),
and
also
that
this
was
almost
the
sole
reliance
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
holding
that
they
could
divine
congress'
intent,
because
subsection
(c)
was
worded
in
a
different
way.
subsection
(c)
is
a
two-actor
offense.
the
offense...
the
statute
is
directed
against
whoever
presents
coupons
for
redemption,
namely
a
grocery
stores
who's
redeeming
coupons;
and
that
that
person
who's
knowing
that
he's
presented
coupons
for
redemption,
knows
that
those
coupons
were
received,
transferred
or
used
in
a
manner
in
violation
of
the
chapter,
which
could
be
a
different
person.
so
in
other
words,
you're
saying
the
person
presenting
the
coupons
knew
that,
if
it
was
another
person,
that
other
person
got
the
food
stamps
in
an
illegal
manner.
that
is,
to
me,
the
pure
answer
of
why
the
word
(b).
it's
a--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--it
requires
the...
yes.
it
requires
the
knowledge
that's
specifically
stated
there;
in
other
words,
knowledge
that
these
stamps
were
received
in--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--as
to
that
only...
no,
no,
no,
no.
that...
well,
yes,
right;
that
specific
intent,
that
element
has
to
be
proved,
namely
that
the
person
presenting
the
stamps
for
redemption
has
to
know
that
those
stamps
were
received
by
somebody
in
violation
of
the
statute.
but
in
subsection
(c)
they
don't
say
whoever
knowingly
presents
food
stamps
for
redemption.
congress
in
that
section
did
not
feel
that
they
had
to
use
the
word
"knowingly"
to
prevent
the
prosecution
of
a
grocer
who's
handing
in
something
that
he
doesn't
know
are
food
stamps.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
well,
here
again,
i
think
that
the
model
penal
code
offers
guidance,
because
the
definition
of
"knowingly"
there
as
to
an
act
is
different
than
"knowingly"
as
to
a
circumstance.
we're
talking
about
a
circumstance
here,
and
i
think
the
definition
is
very
straightforward,
that
he
knows
that
such
facts
exist.
and
here
the
circumstance
is
that
they
were
acquired
in
a
manner
in
violation
of
the
statute.
he
knows
that
that
fact
exists,
that
that
was
the
manner
in
which
they
were
acquired.
so
i
think
that
"knowingly"
is
a
very
accurate
term.
i
think
that
this
court's
bailey
decision,
united
states
v.
bailey,
i
think
has
been...
had
a
very
salutory
effect
in
eliminating
in
many
criminal
trials
this
same
specific
intent
instruction
that
i
submitted
in
this
case.
and
pointing
out
that
it
would
be
much
more
useful
to
a
jury
for
a
judge
to
specifically
address
the
mental
element
that
is
required
for
each
specific
element
in
the
offense.
and
a
federal
judge
is
at
a
disadvantage
over
a
state
judge,
and
i
have
cited
an
illinois
case,
the
valley
steel
case,
as
an
illustration
of
how
much
easier
this
job
is
for
a
judge
in
a
state
that's
adopted
the
model
penal
code
where
you
can
look
at
the
rules
of
construction
and
find,
if
it's
not
expressly
put
in
there
by
the
legislature,
find
what
the
mental
element
is
as
to
each
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
well,
i
think
that
question
is
particularly
raised
in
this
case
because
of
what
i
pointed
out
in
my
reply
brief,
that
in
fact,
his
knowledge
was
argued
to
the
jury,
even
though
the
judge
said
that
i
couldn't
argue
it,
the
prosecutor
argued
it
even
though
she
didn't
have
to,
and
then
i
argued
it
responding
to
the
prosecutor.
and
so
i
think
that--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--on
that
point,
it
clearly
presents
this
question:
is
it
sufficient
to
say
that
the
jury
must
have
decided
that
in
the
absence
of
an
instruction,
and
i
say
no.
i
think
that
it's
a
very
important
principle
to
uphold,
that
the
jury
listens
particularly
to
the
instruction
of
the
judge,
and
may
discard
or
not
pay
attention
to
the
arguments
of
the
lawyers,
and
look
to
the
judge
for
the
instruction
on
the
law.
and
i
think
that
sometimes
it
seems
that
it's
harsh
to
reverse
a
criminal
conviction
and
have
a
new
trial
because
of
instructions,
but
i
think
that
here
you
certainly
don't
have
a
harmless
misinstruction,
if
it
is
a
misinstruction.
it's
very
crucial.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
no,
because
the
jury
when
they
got
back
to
deliberate,
they
were
looking
at
this
instruction,
they
found
that
they
did
not
have
to
find
that
he
knew
that
it
was
in
a
manner
in
violation
of
the
statute.
and
the
colloquy
makes
clear
that
the
judge
was
clearly
trying
to
make
that
distinction
in
these
instructions.
i
want
to
say
something
about
the
yermian
case.
the
government
has
pinned
its
argument
very
closely
to
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
yermian,
trying
to
say
that
this
statute
is
similar
to
yermian,
and
the
case
should
be
decided
in
the
same
manner.
the
text
is
different
from
the
text,
and
the
circumstances
are
different,
and
the
case
is
not
governed
by
the
yermian
decision.
yermian
involved
section
1001,
and
you
had
the
making
of
a
false
statement,
and
then
the
phrase
"in
any
matter
in
a
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
agency.
"
in
that
statute
the
phrase
"in
any
matter"
came
at
the
beginning
of
the
sentence
before
the
word
"knowingly".
that's
a
difference.
the
previous
statute,
which
the
court
also
said
in
a
footnote
also
has
a
clear
meaning
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
that
phrase,
the
phrase
did
follow
the
word
"knowingly",
but
they
were
separated
by
a
comma.
i
think
that...
and
even
the
statute
where
it
came
at
the
beginning,
four
members
of
this
court
felt
that
it
wasn't
clear
it
was
congress'
meaning
that
the
word
"knowingly"
did
not
apply
to
that
phrase
"in
any
matter".
but
i
think
more
importantly,
the
background
of
this
case
makes
it
crucially
different.
there's
two
steps
involved
here
to
the
government's
argument,
and
they
don't
really
follow
through
on
the
second
step.
it's
one
thing
to
say
did
congress
mean
the
word
"knowingly"
to
apply
to
this
phrase
"in
any
manner",
but
if
you
agree
with
them
that
it
doesn't,
then
you
have
the
next
question:
what
mental
state
should
be
applied
to
that
element
of
this
offense?
and
this
court
has
clearly
stated
on
several
occasions...
in
the
bailey
case,
in
the
united
states
gypsum
case,
and
in
the
morissette
case...
that
the
mere
omission
of
a
word
defining
the
mental
intent
does
not
mean
that
it's
strict
liability.
it
does
not
answer
the
question
just
to
say
there
isn't
any
word
there
defining
the
mental
element.
and
i
think
that
it's--
well,
so
the
yermian
court
then
went
on
and
relied
on
a
couple
of
elements
that
are
not
present
in
this
case,
the
first
being
that
it
was
a
jurisdictional
element.
and
the
court
clearly
stated
that
jurisdictional
language
need
not
contain
the
same
culpability
requirement
as
other
elements
of
the
offense,
quoting
this
court's
opinion
in
feola.
and
the
fact
that
that
was
a
jurisdictional
element
in
yermian
clearly
was
a
point
of
distinction
for
this
court
in
trying
to
discern
the
meaning
of
congress
in
the
statute.
secondly,
yermian
had
a
particular...
the
statute
had
a
particular
legislative
history
which
was
debated
at
length
in
both
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions,
which
we
do
not
have
here...
a
dissenting
opinion
where
the
statute
originally
made
it
clear
that
it
was
only
a
defendant
that
knew
he
was
defrauding
the
united
states
could
be
convicted,
and
then
during...
because
of
the
vicissitudes
of
that
statute,
that
language
had
been
taken
out,
the
issue
being
how
much
of
the
language
had
been
taken
out.
so
that
the
analysis...
in
other
words,
my
central
point
is
the
analysis
doesn't
stop
once
you
say
that
congress
didn't
mean
"knowingly"
to
apply
to
this
phrase
"in
any
manner".
the
analysis
does
not
stop
there.
then
you
have
to
look
to
other
principles
and...
principles
of
construction,
the
background
of
the
statute,
and
so
forth.
now--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--it
could
be
the
same
person,
and
it
could
be
different
persons.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
well,
i
think
that
that's
true,
that
you
could...
if
there
were
a
grocer
presenting
coupons,
he
would
be...
he
would
by
definition
violate
both
sections
certainly.
he's
acquired
them.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
i
think
that
would
be
a
possibility.
i
imagine
that--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--you
might
imagine
some
situations,
but
i
certainly
cannot
offhand
imagine
a
situation
where
a
grocer
presenting
coupons
under
(c)
who
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
violating
(b)
because
he
acquired
the
coupons.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
the
subsection
(c)?
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
no.
there's...
actually,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
what
my
client
did
with
these
food
stamps.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
acquiring,
that's
it.
no,
there's
no--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--yes,
although
i
would...
if
it
was
sent
back
for
a
new
trial,
i
would
certainly
be
content
for
an
instruction
specifically
addressed
to
this
element;
that
the
jury
be
instructed
that
the
defendant
had
to
know
that
it
was--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--in
other
words,
i
don't
think
i
would
offer
my
specific
intent
instruction
on
a
retrial.
on
a
retrial,
having
more
time
to
consider
it,
i
would
have
a
more
precise
instruction.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
yes.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
thank
you.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
do
not
agree,
of
course,
with
the
government
that
congress
has
put
a
tremendous
burden
on
the
government
in
proving
a
case
that
they
would
have
to
prove
knowledge
of
complex
regulations.
what
the
government
has
to
prove
is
that
the
defendant
knew
that
what
he
was
doing
was
unauthorized,
was
in
a
manner
nonauthorized.
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
has
to...
it's
no
more
difficult
than
proving
criminal
intent
in
any
other
case.
and
the
government
answers
its
own
argument
when
it
then,
in
response
to
the
examples
that
were
given
about
the
possible
reach
of
their
interpretation,
keeps
coming
back
with
the
argument
that
reasonable
people
would
have
some
suspicions
in
a
case
like
this.
that
precisely
makes
my
point.
in
any
kind
of
case
that
the
government
has
any
business
bringing
under
this
criminal
provision,
you
have
a
situation...
basic
fairness
dictates
that
you
would
have
a
situation
where
people
would
agree
a
reasonable
person
should
have
some
suspicions,
should
have
known
that
there
was
something
wrong.
and
in
addition,
you
have
the
particular
circumstance
here
of
an
enforcement
program
that
gives
extensive
notice.
you
have
visits,
warning
letters,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
so
that
it's
particularly
true
in
this
case
that
wherever
the
government
is
reasonably
directing
enforcement,
this
is
not
a
tremendous
burden
to
prove
knowledge
that
they're
violating
the
statute.
the
questioning
about
the
grocer
just
points
out
what
the
possible
breadth
of
reach
of
the
government's
interpretation
is,
and
the
regulations
are
very
thick
indeed,
and
the
statute
is
very
complex.
i,
searching
for
an
example,
on
page
25
of
my
brief
i
put
in
an
example
about
a
particularly
complex
regulation
about
an
elderly
person
receiving
an
allotment
because
he
was
a
separate
household
from
people
that
he
was
living
with.
and
that's
the
same
example.
if
he
didn't
meet
those
criteria,
he
would
be
acquiring
his
food
stamps
in
a
manner
not
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
government
probably
reasonably
wouldn't
prosecute
such
a
person;
but
i
think
that
we've
got
to
give
a
reading
to
the
statute
that
wouldn't
allow
such--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--pardon
me?
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
no.
that's--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--that's
an
example
of
someone
who
could
be
prosecuted
under
the
government's
example...
reading
of
the
statute;
however,
they
probably
never
would.
but
i
think
that
the
statute
should
be
given
the
reading
that
congress
intended,
reasonable
requirement
of
proof
by
the
government
that
people--
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
--yes.
that
would
meet...
i
think
here
again
is
a
place
where
the
model
penal
code
is
useful.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
yes.
i
would
commend
to
the
trial
judge
the
model
penal
code's
definitions
here
where
they
make
allowance
for
that
kind
of
knowledge.
mr.
william
thomas
huyck
well,
here
again,
if
we're
going
to
have
an
era
where
federal
trial
courts
are
going
to
more
precisely
instruct
juries
on
mental
intent
than
they
have
with
this
boilerplate
instruction
i
used
in
this
case,
probably
there's
going
to
have
to
be
some
guidance.
and
i
think
that
in
many
states
in
this
union,
i
think
38
of
them,
they
use
the
model
penal
code.
we
don't
have
a
federal
criminal
code
that
does
that.
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
how
using
the
considered
opinion
of
the
american
law
institute
would
bring
about
a
good
definition
for
a
case
of
this
type.
the
question
was
asked
whether
united
states
gypsum
is
dispositive
here.
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
about
united
states
gypsum
is
it's
one
of
three
cases...
the
bailey
case,
the
u.s.
gypsum
case,
and
the
freed
case...
where
this
court
has
addressed
statutes
where
no
intent
term
is
set
forth
and
has
adopted
the
very
reasonable
positions
of
the
model
penal
code
on
what
kind
of
mental
elements
should
be
reasonably
found
in
a
statute.
and
i
think
that
certainly
the
u.s.
gypsum
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
if
it's
a
felony,
and
cites
the
model
penal
code
for
this,
you
ought
not
to
be
sending
unknowing
persons
to
prison
for
a
felony
except
in
very
limited
circumstances.
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
only
limited
circumstances
this
court
has
ever
recognized
are
cases
such
as
yermian
where
you're
talking
about
a
jurisdiction,
and
the
dangerous
instrumentality
cases.
thank
you.
