justice
stevens
why
not?
i
don't
understand
that.
if
you
get
a
letter,
and
you
open
it,
and
you
take
the
contents
out,
you've
acquired
the
contents,
haven't
you?
why
wouldn't
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
stevens
i
mean
you
say
that's
not
an
acquisition?
justice
stevens
if
he
throws
it
away,
he
violates
the
regulation,
doesn't
he?
justice
stevens
if
he
throws
it
away,
doesn't
that
violate
a
regulation?
justice
stevens
disposes
of
them
in
any
way.
if
he
tears
them
up,
it
violates
the
regulation,
doesn't
it?
alters
them
in
any
way?
justice
stevens
if
he
got
an
envelope
with
stamps
in
them
and
tore
them
up
and
threw
them
in
the
wastebasket,
under
your
view
he'd
commit
the
crime,
i
think.
justice
stevens
well,
in
this
case
it'd
be
a
line
between
somebody
who
doesn't
know
it's
wrong
to
tear
up
the
food
stamps
and
somebody
who
does.
i
bet
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
don't
know
it's
wrong
to
throw
away
food
stamps,
who
haven't
dealt
with
them
regularly.
i'm
not
sure
everyone
knows
that.
justice
stevens
but
that's
the
kind
of
thing
you
want
to
cover.
you
want
to
cover
the
people
who
do
not
know
that
what
they're
doing
is
unlawful.
justice
stevens
or
people
you
can't
prove
that
they
knew
it
was
unlawful.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
comment?
i
hadn't
really
thought
much
about
it
before
mr.
huyck's
argument,
but
he
cited
the
gypsum
case...
you
remember
the
antitrust
case...
with
no
word
of
knowing
anything
in
it
at
all.
and
the
court
held
that
in
the
criminal
context,
the
general
rule
is
you
have
presumed
some
kind
of
mens
rea
requirement.
why
isn't
that
case
dispositive?
justice
stevens
well,
that
would
be...
that
would
give
him
a
defense
under
(c).
justice
stevens
but
it
would
not
give
him
a
defense
under
(b),
under
your
view--
justice
stevens
--would
it?
justice
stevens
let
me
back
up.
now,
the
proprietor...
i
know
you're
not
talking
about
respondeat
superior.
but
i
own
a
grocery
store.
one
of
my
clerks
violates
the
law
and
gets
the
stamps.
he
gives
them
to
me,
and
i
don't
know
he's
done
anything
wrong,
but
i
am
not
authorized
to
have
them,
and
i
now
pass
them
on
to
the
government
for
money.
i
have
not
violated
(c)
because
i
didn't
know
they
were
acquired
illegally,
but
i
have
violated
the
regulation
under
(b),
have
i
not?
justice
stevens
i
have
knowingly
transferred
the
coupon.
that's
what...
i
didn't
know
it
was
not
authorized
by
law.
but
i
knowingly...
i
knew
it
was
a
food
stamp.
i
came
right
within
the
square
language
as
you
read
it.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you,
supposing
one
of
my
clerks
is
in
some
kind
of
a
counterfeit
operation.
he
gives
me
a
whole
bundle
of
legitimate
food
stamps,
but
they've
either
been
stolen
or
acquired
in
an
illegal
way.
do
the
regulations
authorize
me
to
turn
those
into
money?
would
i
violate
a
regulation
if
i
turned
them
in,
or
could
i
just
go
ahead
and
sell
them
and
keep
the
money?
justice
stevens
because
the
regulations
prohibit
me
from
selling
them,
isn't
that
right?
otherwise,
why
can't
i
keep
the
money?
justice
stevens
then
why
can't
he
keep
the
money?
justice
stevens
the
remedy
would
be,
under
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
he'd
go
to
jail.
that's
as
i
read
it.
under
your
interpretation
of
(b).
justice
stevens
let
me
change
my
question.
supposing
my
grocer
has
this
big
bundle
of
illegally
acquired
food
stamps.
he's
got
them
in
his
desk
drawer.
he
thinks
they're
perfectly
lawful.
is
he
now
violating
the
statute?
somebody
walks
in
on
him.
they
find
the
food
stamps
there,
and
they
got
to
him
through
his
subordinate
who
had
gotten
them
illegally.
he
gave
them
to
the
boss.
the
boss
has
them
in
his
desk.
he
possesses
them.
is
he
in
violation
of
(b)
or
not?
i
ask
you
first
before
the
man
tells
him,
and
then
later
on
a
man
comes
in
and
tells
him
by
the
way,
they're
all
stolen.
does
that
make
any
difference
on
his
liability?
justice
stevens
he
got
them
from
a
subordinate
who'd
stolen
them
and
brought
them
into
the
boss
and
said
here
are
a
bunch
of
food
stamps,
and
he
possesses
them.
that's
the
charge
now.
he
possesses.
is
he
possessing
them
illegally?
justice
stevens
and
if
he's
not,
does
he
start
to
possess
them
illegally
when
somebody
tells
him
they're
all
stolen,
you
know?
justice
stevens
illegally.
now,
before
he
was
told,
all
he
knew
was
that
he
possessed
them,
but
that's
not
illegal,
you
say.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
the
critical
difference
in
your
view
is
his
knowledge.
justice
stevens
not
just
acquisition.
it's
possesses,
possesses.
justice
stevens
and
i'm
asking
you:
a)
whether
the
possession
is
unlawful
when
there
are
a
bunch
of
stolen
food
stamps
in
his
desk
that
he
doesn't
know
are
stolen;
and
b)
does
it
become
unlawful
when
he's
advised
that
they're
stolen
food
stamps?
and
i
really
don't
know
your
position.
justice
stevens
he
knows
they're
food
stamps,
and
he
knows
he
possesses
them.
justice
stevens
this
brings
us
back
to
the
colloquy
earlier
in
the
argument
about
the
difference
between
drugs
or
guns
or
things.
i
mean
you
can
see
that
if
you
just
possess
drugs,
that's
a
crime.
you
don't
have
to
know
there's
a
law
against
possessing
drugs,
but
from
the
nature
of
the
item.
but
people
can
possess
food
stamps
and
not
have
any
idea
that
they're
doing
anything
unlawful.
but
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
they'd
go
to
jail.
justice
stevens
our
hypothetical
was
the
clerk
in
the
grocery
store
was
the
crook,
and
he
delivered
the
stuff
to
the
boss.
that's
how
you
differentiated
between
(b)
and
(c).
justice
stevens
knows
he
possesses
food
stamps,
but
he
doesn't
know
it's
in
violation
of
any
regulation.
and
is
not
that
the
classic
example
of
what
you
say
the
statute
applies
to?
justice
stevens
yes,
if
it
modifies
"acquisition",
it
also
modifies
"possesses"
in
the
same
way.
you
can't--
justice
stevens
--that's
exactly
the
person
i'd
be
concerned
with.
that's
the
reason
for
having
a
mens
rea
requirement
in
criminal
law
is
to
be
sure
you
don't
get
innocent
people
sent
to
jail.
they
should
know
they're
doing
something
wrong
before
you
send
them
to
jail.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you
keep
avoiding
the
point,
would
you
not
agree
that
he
would
possess
them
in
violation
of
a
regulation
under
those
facts?
justice
stevens
so
all
you're
proving,
all
you're
suggesting
is
that
in
the
appropriate
case
it's
easy
to
prove
the
requisite
intent,
and
it's
hard
to
prove
it
in
a
case
such
as
the
one
i
hypothesized.
that's
exactly
why
congress
would
probably
impose
an
intent
requirement.
i've
taken
too
much
of
your
time.
justice
stevens
but
you
do
agree
that
subsection
(c)
requires
specific
intent.
justice
stevens
or
whatever...
mens
rea,
at
least
knowledge
of
wrongdoing.
