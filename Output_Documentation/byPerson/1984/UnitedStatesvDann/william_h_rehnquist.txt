justice
rehnquist
that
sort
of
a
defense
is
no
good
against
the
government,
is
it,
aboriginal
title?
apart
from
the
indian
claims
commission,
anything
the
government
got
by
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo,
it
can
kick
anybody
it
wants
to
off
of.
justice
rehnquist
let's
try
to
be
precise.
if
the
government
brings
an
action,
an
ejectment
against
someone,
claiming
that
the
government
owns
the
land,
and
the
defense
is
aboriginal
title,
that
simply
is...
that
is
summary
judgment
for
the
government,
is
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
did
they
make
their
due
process
argument
at
all
in
the
court
of
claims
as
intervenors?
justice
rehnquist
why
do
you
get
to
the
merits
of
it
at
all?
aren't
they
concluded
by
the
decision--
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
the
district
court
make
any
finding
as
to
whether
this
was
land
acquired
by
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo?
justice
rehnquist
they
agreed
that
it
was?
so
i
suppose
it
originally
became
the
property
of
the
government
upon
execution
of
the
treaty.
justice
rehnquist
how
did
the
district
court
find
that
the
beneficial
title
had
gotten
into
the
shoshone?
justice
rehnquist
not
legal
title.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
congress
that
just
adjourned?
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
the
danns
move
to
intervene
in
the
indian
claims
commission?
justice
rehnquist
and
was
that
motion
granted
or
denied?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
in
the
court
of
claims?
did
they
raise
it
again?
justice
rehnquist
i
see.
but
if
the
denial
was
based
in
part
on
the
merits
of
the
claim,
aren't
you
precluded
by
res
judicata?
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
fact
that
they
didn't
let
you
put
on
evidence
doesn't
mean
that
res
judicata
doesn't
apply.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
was
the
theory
of
your
motion
to
intervene
before
the
indian
claims
commission?
justice
rehnquist
was
the
same
theory
used
in
your
motion
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
rehnquist
you
are
precluded,
at
least
on
the
issues
on
which
you
sought
to
intervene,
are
you
not?
justice
rehnquist
even
as
to
the
same
issues
which
you
litigated
with
the
government
before
the
court
of
claims?
justice
rehnquist
distinct
from
the
one
that
you
asserted
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
rehnquist
those
were
all
cases,
though,
where
the
fight
was
between
the
indian
claimants
and
a
grantee
of
the
government
under
the
railroad
act.
they
weren't
cases
in
which
the
united
states
squarely
opposed
the
indian
claim.
justice
rehnquist
right.
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
no
one
would
suggest
that
the
mere
filing
of
an
ejection
complaint
would
extinguish
any
title
at
all.
my
point
was
that
when
the
government
is
up
against
aboriginal,
at
least
aboriginal
indian
title,
that
unless
you
claim
under
a
deed
from
the
government,
your
claim
is
no
good
against
the
government.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
respondents
obviously
don't
think
the
government
has
been
fair,
and
i
think
the
government
may
have
kind
of
spoken
out
of
both
sides
of
its
mouth
in
the
district
court,
but
it
seems
to
me
when
you
come
up
here
and
you
get
a
question
as
to
what
is
the
nature
of
aboriginal
title,
can
it
stand
against
the
government,
a
member
of
the
court
is
entitled
to
a
frank
answer.
and
what
is
that
answer?
