justice
white
well,
the
claims
commission
found
that
aboriginal
title
had
been
extinguished.
justice
white
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
the
claim
that
the
united
states
has
not
gone
through
the
procedures
that
are
necessary
under
the
act
to
effect
payment?
justice
white
yes.
how
about
the
payment
after
judgment
of
the
indian
claims
commission?
justice
white
is
there
another
statute
that
deals
with
how
payment
is
to
be
effected,
some
procedural
detail?
justice
white
that
is
what
i
am
interested
in.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
white
and
so
has
the
interior,
has
the
interior
got
that
judgment
to
its
credit
now?
justice
white
have
you
reported
that
to
the
secretary
of
treasury?
justice
white
what
can
ever
be
done
with
that
money?
that
is
tribal
money,
i
take
it.
justice
white
for
whom?
justice
white
if
it
is
to
be
distributed,
i
suppose
the
tribe
could
just
hold
it
and
use
the
income
from
it
for
the
benefit
of
its
members.
justice
white
and
what
makes
you
think
that
the...
let's
assume
that
the
judgment
really
is
final
with
respect
to
the
tribe.
of
course,
you
didn't
sue
the
tribe.
justice
white
you
sued
individual
indians.
justice
white
why
do
you
think
they
are
foreclosed
by
the
fact
of
payment?
they
have
never
been
paid
anything.
justice
white
their
tribe
has.
justice
white
so
you
say
that
the
indian
claims
commission
judgment
which
you
say
has
been
paid
forecloses
any
other
claim
by
the
tribe
or
by
any
of
its
members
to
that
particular
land
for
which
the
money
was
paid.
justice
white
but
i
suppose
the
individual
indians
have
claims
that
have
original
title.
let's
assume
that
the
tribe
had
never
litigated.
there
had
never
been
an
indian
claims
commission
judgment
here,
and
you
sued
these
individual
tribal
members.
they
could
claim
aboriginal
title
themselves,
couldn't
they?
justice
white
but
their
title
is
no
better
than
tribal
title?
justice
white
right,
so
that
if
tribal...
but
their
right,
their
right
doesn't
last
any
longer
than
tribal
title
does.
and
if
tribal
title
has
been
extinguished,
so
has
theirs.
justice
white
aboriginal.
that
is
what
you
are
talking
about.
justice
white
possessory.
justice
white
the
right
of
possession.
justice
white
of
course,
i
take
it
part
of
your
position
is
that
even
if
there
had
been
an
act
saying,
telling
interior
to
whom
to
distribute
the
money,
and
they
had
distributed
it,
that
your
clients
would
not--
justice
white
--would
not
be
bound
at
all.
justice
white
was
that
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
they
didn't
need
to
reach
it,
i
take
it.
justice
white
what
is
your
other
point?
you
say
two
other
reasons.
justice
white
now,
did
you
present
that
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
can
the
executive
branch
do
that
without
going
to
court
at
all?
justice
white
right.
that's
what
i
thought.
that
action
has
not
taken
place.
