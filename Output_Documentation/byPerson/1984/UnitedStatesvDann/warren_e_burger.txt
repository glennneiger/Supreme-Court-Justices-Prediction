you

if
an
individual
indian
or
two
or
three
of
them
brought
an
action,
they
would
be
bringing
it
in
terms
of
any
result
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
tribe,
would
they
not?
chief

is
something
like
a

chief
justice
burger
you
don't
agree
that
they

get
a
grazing

as
your
friend
just
suggested?
chief

why
isn't
this

something
like,
not
precisely
like,
but
something
like
a
deposit
the
government
makes
with
the
district

when
they
condemn

isn't
it
much
the
same,
except
that--
chief

--well,
title
passes
to
the
government
when
they
make
the
deposit.
it
may
be...
the
amount
may
be
adjusted

when
they
move.
chief

it
is
in

these
indians?
chief

isn't
your
quarrel
there
with
congress,
with
the
law
as
it
is?
chief
justice

i
think
you
understate
that
a
little.

couldn't
take
it
back.
