justice
blackmun
mr.
mcconnell,
suppose
we
affirm,
and
i
will
give
you
the
same
question,
suppose
we
reverse?
what
happens?
doesn't
congress
still
have
to
act?
justice
blackmun
certainly
whatever
we
decide
here
does
not
tie
the
hands
of
congress,
does
it?
justice
blackmun
are
we
spinning
our
wheels
in
this
case?
justice
blackmun
isn't
that
all
that
is
claimed
here?
justice
blackmun
they
have
given
up
any
claim
for
recognized
title
other
than
aboriginal?
