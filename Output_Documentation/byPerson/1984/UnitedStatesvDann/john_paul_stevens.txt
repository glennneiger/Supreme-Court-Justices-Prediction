justice
stevens
mr.
o'connell,
can
i
just
ask
you
one
question,
going
back
to
what
the
chief
justice
asked
earlier?
how
much
of
a
burden
is
it
to
get
a
grazing
permit
on
your...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
issue
really
is
when
you
have
to
get
the
permit.
justice
stevens
how
serious--
justice
stevens
--don't
you...
you
are
going
to
have
to
get
the
permit
sooner
or
later.
justice
stevens
even
after
payment
you
would
say,
ever
after
what
you
would
agree
was
payment.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
i
thought
the
question
was
just
when--
justice
stevens
--i
don't
want
to...
just
tell
me,
how
serious
is
this
financial
burden
of
getting
a
permit?
i
just
don't
happen
to
know.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question,
mr.
mcconnell?
if
we
analogize
this
case
to
a
condemnation,
and
i
realize
there
are
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
you
don't,
and
just
focus
on
the
payment
issue
for
a
moment,
is
it
not
correct
that
in
that
context,
a
payment
wouldn't
occur
until
the
former
owner
of
the
land
actually
received
some
beneficial
use
of
the
money?
justice
stevens
they
make
the
argument...
i
am
not
sure
it
carries
the
day
by
any
means,
but
they
say,
in
effect,
well,
that
is
all
well
and
good.
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
it
is
as
though
it
were
in
escrow.
in
the
meantime,
we
have
got
to
get
funds
somewhere
to
either
pay
fees
or
get
off
the
land,
and
we
shouldn't
have
to
do
that
until
we
have
got
some
benefit
that
we
can
lay
our
hands
on.
