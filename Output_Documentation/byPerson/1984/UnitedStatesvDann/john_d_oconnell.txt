mr.
john
d.
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
mary
and
carrie
dann
were
born
on
the
very
lands
that
are
the
subject
of
this
case
over
a
half-century
ago,
and
all
their
lives
they
have
used
these
lands
to
support
themselves
by
their
own
labors.
the
dann
family
has
been
ranching
this
area
for
three
generations,
and
using
and
occupying
it
for
countless
generations
before
that.
the
government
now
seeks
to
eject
the
danns
from
their
property
without
regard
for
the
lawfulness
of
their
occupancy
or
the
validity
of
their
title
on
the
merits
because
of
a
ruling
in
a
collateral
proceeding
where
the
extinguishment
issue
was
never
in
contention
nor
actually
litigated,
and
where
the
interests
of
the
danns
were
not
represented.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
they
could
get
a
grazing
permit,
your
honor,
but
they
do
not
need
a
grazing
permit
to
graze
on
lands
that
do
not
belong
to
the
government,
and
the
government
does
not
want
to
litigate
whether
or
not
these
lands
belong
to
the
government.
the
government
has
evaded
that
issue
throughout
these
proceedings.
they
will
not
allow
the
issue
to
be
tried
on
the
merits.
they
lost
on
the
merits
in
the--
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
--in
another
form
with
what
we
believe
are
different
parties
on
a
different
claim.
we
believe
that
the
drastic
remedy,
this
remedy
of
ejectment
of
people
from
property
which
is
conceded
by
everybody
in
the
area
to
be
theirs,
this
drastic
remedy
turns
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
the
act
they
rely
on
in
this
court,
it
turns
it
on
its
head.
the
purpose
of
that
act
was
to
provide
relief
for
ancient
wrongs,
not
to
provide
a
vehicle
for
the
government
to
seize
property
today
in
the
first
instance.
this
is
property
that
the
government
never
had
in
its
possession,
never
owned.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
government
acquired
this
land
as
of
december
6th,
1979,
by
the
paper
coming
over
from
the
court
of
claims
to
the
treasury,
that
the
real
estate
transaction
occurred
in
1979.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
made
that
finding,
but
i
believe
both
parties...
that
was
in
the
pretrial
order.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
your
honor,
the
fee
would
be
in
the
united
states,
but
the
beneficial
title
was
in
the
western
shoshone,
quite
clearly,
and
the
trial
court
found
that
it
was
up
until
december,
1979.
that
is
why
the
trial
court
denied
damages
to
the
government.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
the
government
conceded
that
the
shoshone
had
beneficial
title
at
the
time
of
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo,
your
honor,
and
that
was
in
the
pretrial
order,
too.
it
was
uncontested...
it
was
uncontested
that
the
western
shoshone
had
title
to
start
with.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
beneficial
title,
aboriginal
title.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
yes.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
yes,
possessory
title.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
yes,
and
it
was
conceded
that
the
indians
have
title.
the
problem
was
that
the
government
had
to
prove
that
it
had
acquired
title,
and
of
course
it
tried
to
evade
that.
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
once,
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
court
had
to
rule.
the
court
couldn't
find
that
the
government
had
ever
acquired
title,
so
the
court
at
the
request
of
the
government
and
over
our
demands
for
a
trial
waited
for
years
for
the
government
to
come
up
with
this
piece
of
paper
that
gave
it
a
preclusive
effect
about
a
trespass
case
that
happened
years
before,
and
the
reason
it
did
that
is
because
the
government
could
not
prove
any
lawful
right
it
had
to
move
these
indians
off
their
land.
we
would
like
to
make
three
major
arguments
in
this
regard.
first,
the
danns
are
not
precluded
in
this
action
by
the
judgment
in
a
statutory
claims
proceeding
because
the
statute
states
that
discharge
does
not
occur
until
payment,
and
payment
cannot
be
made
until
congress
legislates
the
necessary
direction
to
effectuate
that
payment.
second,
even
if
payment
is
made,
the
preclusive
effect
on
this
action
is
limited
because
the
interests
of
the
property
owner,
the
interests
of
the
property
owner
was
not
represented,
and
because
the
issues
involved
in
those
proceedings
were
entirely
different
and
based
on
entirely
different
premises
and
concepts
of
law
from
those
involved
in
this
case
here.
and
third,
in
the
alternative,
the
danns
have
asserted
throughout
the
proceedings,
starting
with
in
the
answer,
very
specifically
that
they
have
individual
indian
title
to
the
lands
involved
in
this
case,
and
this
court
has
held
such
individual
rights
are
different
from
and
survive,
individual
indian
title
survives
a
relinquishment
of
tribal
title.
now,
the
judgment
in
the...
addressing
my
affirmative
argument,
the
judgment
in
the
claims
proceeding
was
obtained
by
the
"western
shoshone
identifiable
group".
western
shoshone
identifiable
group.
the
government
contends
the
judgment
funds
are
tribal
funds,
and
in
answering
the
question,
said,
well,
they
are
being
held
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.
however,
the
western
shoshone
identifiable
group
is
not
a
tribal
entity
in
any
real
sense
or
in
the
sense
that
it
has
a
political
structure
or
even
that
it
is
a
definable
class.
it
right
now
is
just
a
name.
the
indian
claims
commission
specifically
found
that
the
western
shoshone
had
no
political
structure
at
that
time,
and
designated
the
claimholder
to
be
an
identifiable
group.
now,
this
is
one
of
the
very
peculiar
things
about
the
way
the
indian
claims
commission
act
worked.
you
could
have
a
lawsuit
with
the
plaintiff,
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff
being
held
in
suspension.
the
court
of
claims
and
this
court
have
held,
in
fact,
in
the
case
that
counsel
relies
on
so
heavily,
delaware
tribal
business
committee
versus
weeks,
the
court
of
claims
and
this
court
have
held
that
the
designation
of
the
existing
entity,
entities,
or
class
of
persons
entitled
to
share
in
that
award
is
an
exercise
of
the
plenary
power
of
congress.
congress
exercises
that
power
in
the
distribution
legislation.
until
congress
legislations
a
distribution
plan,
no
person,
class
of
persons,
or
entity,
no
tribe,
no
tribe
has
any
sort
of
enforceable
interest
in
the
judgment
funds.
the
only
thing
that
has
an
interest
in
the
judgment
funds
is
an
identifiable
group.
but
nobody
can
claim
to
be
that
identifiable
group
until
congress
acts.
and
this
court
has
held
that
constitutionally,
using
its
plenary
power,
congress
can
designate
anybody
it
wants
to
be
that
entity,
as
long
as
there
is
just
some
connection
with
congress's
concern
for
indians.
so,
it
is
not,
it
is
not
as
if
the
navajo
nation
or
the
western
shoshone
nation,
which
now
has
a
political
entity,
and
that
is
the
western
shoshone
national
council,
it
is
not
as
if
the
western
shoshone
national
council
has
a
beneficial
interest
in
those
funds.
the
western
shoshone
identifiable
group
may
be
all
persons
of
western
shoshone
descent,
like
all
persons
of
irish
descent,
and
we
litigate
all
persons
of
irish
descent,
and
then
try
to
use
a
preclusive
effect
against
the
republic
of
ireland,
say,
in
regard
to
their
embassy,
and
say,
well,
we
brought
an
action
on
the
part
of
all
people
of
irish
descent
without
anybody
who
can
come
in
and
speak
for
them.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
well,
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
financial
burden...
this
area
is
so
marginal
that
the
people
who
operate
in
it
are
mostly
hobby
farmers
and
these
indians,
who
are
willing
to
do
the
hard
work
and
work
the
long
hours,
and
i
believe
that
is
in
some
of
the
material
you
furnished
the
court.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
but
the
offensiveness
of
getting
a
permit,
your
honor,
is
to
get
a
permit
for
your
own
home.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
recognize
that.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
in
regard
to
the
danns,
i
don't
believe
the
danns
will
have
to
get
a
permit.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
for
several
reasons,
your
honor,
which
i
would
be
willing
to
go
into.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
your
honor,
the
danns
contend
that
they
would
be
unable
to
maintain
their
operation
and
pay
$16,000
a
year,
and
that
is
what
the
government
wants.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
yes.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
yes,
your
honor.
but
when
you
get
down
to
spreading
the
livestock
over
such
a
vast
area,
it
becomes
marginal
whether
you
can
afford
to
do
it.
cattle
on
the
range
is
somewhat
of
a
dying
industry
in
this
country.
but
there
are
people
who
still
want
to
do
it.
and
they
have
the
right
to
do
it.
and
they
have
the
right
to
do
it
on
their
own
land,
without
requesting
the
government's
permission.
the
taylor
grazing
act
does
not
apply
to
indian
lands,
and
that
is
perfectly
clear,
and
was
held
below,
i
believe,
by
both
courts.
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
the
district
court
did
not
say
that
the
danns
should
stop
grazing
their
cattle
because
the
land
had
not
been
indian
land.
he
held
it
had
been
indian
land,
and
refused
the
government
damages,
and
i
don't
understand
whether
the
government
now
is
still
seeking
damages
for
what
happened
back
in
1973.
but
they
didn't
get
damages
because
it
was
clearly
indian
land
up
until
this
paper
transferred
in
washington.
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
this
distribution
which
counsel
says
is
just
a
ministerial
act
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
an
exercise
of
the
plenary
power
of
congress,
and
although
this--
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
was
discussing
that
until
congress
does
legislate
approval
of
a
distribution
plan,
these
funds
are
in
limbo
because
there
is
no
existing
entity
that
has
a
beneficiary
interest,
and
this
court
has
held
that
no
entity
has
a
right
to
assert
such
an
interest,
that
that
is
entirely
within
the
plenary
power
of
congress
to
designate
who
is
going
to
be
this
identifiable
group.
but
what
is
more,
the
secretary
of
interior,
who
holds
these
funds,
is
prohibited
under
the
distribution
of
judgment
funds
act
from
using
the
funds
for
the
benefit
of
any
person
or
any
entity.
it
is
not
as
if
he
were
holding
the
funds
for
the
benefit
of
the
shoshone
tribe
and
could
set
up
a
scholarship
plan
or
anything
like
that.
he
is
supposed
to
keep
interest,
get
interest
for
these
funds,
but
he,
too,
is
just
to
hold
them
until
congress
designates
who
owns
these
funds.
the
court
of
claims,
in
twice
refusing
to
open
the
question
of
whether
all
lands
had
actually
been
taken
in
the
western
shoshone
claims
proceeding,
commented
on
both
occasions
that
the
danns
or
that
the
indians
who
wanted
to
continue
collateral
litigation
could
do
so,
could
continue
their
collateral
litigation
by
delaying
appropriation
and
"the
direction
necessary
to
pay".
the
court
of
claims
is
intimately
familiar
with
how
the
indian
claims
commission
judgments
are
paid.
the
court
of
claims
did
not
say
that
upon
appropriation
we
were
stopped,
we
could
stop
the
direction
necessary
to
pay.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
construe
the
direction
necessary
to
pay
to
be
anything
other
than
this
legislation
which
is
yet
to
come.
i
believe
in
appendix
m
we
have
the
copy
of
the
letter
from
the
senate
committee
to
the
interior
department
informing
them
that
legislation
would
be
required.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
no,
your
honor,
it
was...
i'm
sorry.
it
was
the
congress
three
years
ago,
i
believe.
i
don't
have
that
accurate.
i
would
have
to
look
at
it.
under
these
circumstances,
payment
and
discharge
cannot
have
occurred.
we
cannot
discharge
the
liability
of
the
united
states
when
there
is
nobody
to
pick
up
the
judgment,
there
is
nobody
who
could
enforce
anything.
it
is
sort
of,
there's
a
judgment
but
nobody
owns
it.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
yes,
for
the
two
reasons--
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
--yes,
for
the
two
reasons
that
i
now
am
going
to
raise.
we
do
not
think
payment
has
occurred,
but
in
the
second
argument,
the
danns
cannot
be
ejected
from
their
property
by
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
indian
claims
commission
award
without
violating
fundamental
due
process
considerations.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
yes,
your
honor.
i
raised
it...
i
raised
it
in
my
brief.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
they
just
did
not...
they
declined
to
reach
it.
they
characterize
it...
they
never
used
the
magic
words,
"due
process
of
law",
and
i
guess
that
is
what
counsel
is
referring
to,
but
they
used
the
privity
of
parties
question,
which
is
a
fundamental
due
process
consideration.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
oh,
then
our
individual
use
and
occupancy
rights,
which
are
entirely
separate
from
the
tribal
rights,
and
survive
tribal
rights.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
i
presented
it,
your
honor.
they
never
even
mentioned
it.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
because
they
were
going
to...
they
said
that
the
western
shoshone
tribal
title
was
not
extinguished.
they
did
not
need
to
get
to
that.
but
if
we
do...
if
this
court
should
hold
that
payment
has
occurred,
or
if
down
the
road
congress
does
act...
congress
has
asked
for
legislation
and
the
executive
has
not
responded.
if
congress
does
act,
or
if
this
court
finds
that
congress
has
acted
or
there
is
payment,
then
this
privity
problem
which
was
avoided
by
the
court
below
and
actually
avoided
by
the
court
of
claims
would
then
have
to
be
confronted.
now,
the
indian
claims
commission
concluded
that
the
temoak
bands,
which
was
the
representative
entity,
"had
the
right
to
maintain
this
action.
"
--i
am
quoting
here...
"for
and
on
behalf
of
the
descendants
of
the
western
shoshone
identifiable
group.
"
now,
that
raises
two
problems
having
to
do
with
privity.
first,
the
commission
made
no
inquiry
or
finding
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
representation,
and
avoided
that
issue
when
it
came
up
again
later,
but
in
its
initial
determination,
there
is
no
findings,
they
don't
say
anything
at
all
about
the
adequacy.
they
just
said
they
have
the
right
to
represent.
the
danns
are
not
members
of
the
temoak
bands.
the
relationship
between
the
danns
and
the
temoak
bands
would
be
the
relationship
between
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
oregon
and
the
state
of
new
york.
the
danns
belong
to
the
dann
band
of
western
shoshone
indians,
which
is
a
separate
entity,
a
coequal
member
of
the
western
shoshone
national
council
with
the
temoak
bands.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
i
am
not
intimately
familiar
with
how
such
deposits
are
made,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
but
in
that
sort
of
situation,
at
some
point
somebody
could
go
into
a
court
and
say,
we
are
entitled
to
that
money.
in
this
situation,
nobody
can
go
into
court
and
say
they
are
entitled
to
this
money
until
congress...
see,
because
no
court
can
make
that
decision.
this
court
has
held
that
this
court
cannot
make
the
decision
as
to
who
that
money
belongs
to.
this
court--
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
--it
is
in
trust
for
the
western
shoshone
identifiable
group,
and
at
some
later
time,
i
think...
i
could
concede
that
at
some
later
time
somebody
could
bring
an
action
for
breach
of
trust,
but
at
this
time
there
is
nobody
who
could
bring
such
an
action
because
constitutionally
it
is
in
the
congress's
power
to
define
who
has
a
right
to
those
funds.
and
until
congress
does
that,
nobody
has
a
right.
i
believe
in
their
brief,
the
government
concedes--
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
--no,
i
don't
have
a
quarrel
with
that,
because
i
am
the
one...
certainly
i
don't
want
anybody
to
have
a
right
to
those
funds,
so
i
have
no
quarrel.
i
think
the
government
has
a
quarrel
with
that.
the
government
wants
to
say,
well,
congress
wasn't
doing
anything
but
reserving
some
ministerial
approval.
it
is
the
government's
problem,
because
until
congress
exercises
its
plenary
jurisdiction,
plenary
power
and
designates
who
the
people
are,
nobody...
they
make
in
their
brief--
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
--it
is
drawing
interest.
it
is
drawing.
it
is
now
much
more
than
that.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
no,
no.
i
would
say
that
it
is
committed.
but
this,
i
think,
is
like
an
escrow
situation
where
the
debtor
has
parted
with
the
money
but
it
has
not
yet
gotten
to
the
other
side.
if
you
allow
a
discharge
under
those
circumstances,
you
now
have
this
western
shoshone
identifiable
group
which
cannot
act
because
it
doesn't
have
any
structure
or
any
defined
membership.
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
a
discharge
of
claim
but
nobody
owns
the
judgment.
then
congress
steps
in.
see,
nobody
can
go
into
court
until...
and
this
court
has
held
that,
and
it
is
a
division
of
powers
problem.
so
no
court
could
say,
well,
this
property
belongs
to
the
temoak
hands,
or
this
property
belongs
to
all
persons
of
western
shoshone
descent,
or
this
property
does
or
does
not
belong
to
the
danns.
and
the
government
answers
that
by
saying,
well,
that's
because
it's
tribal
property,
but
there's
no
tribe.
there
is
just
this
western
shoshone
identifiable
group,
and
no
court
can
say
whose
that
is
until
after
congress
acts.
getting
back
to
the
due
process
problem,
unless
the
temoak
bands,
which
has
no
political
connection...
the
defendants
have
no
political
access
to
the
temoak
bands.
and
unless
the
commission
found
or
there
was
something
in
the
record
that
shows
that
there
is
an
identity
of
interest,
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
temoak
bands
would
assert
the
interests
of
the
rest
of
the
property
holders,
i
do
not
believe
that
you
can
say
that
there
is
some
sort
of
privity
or
there
is
some
sort
of...
basic
fairness
applies,
which
is
necessary,
i
believe,
fundamentally
to
preclusion.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
they
did
not
directly,
but
i
think
that
we
could
concede
it
would
be
the
same
as
if
they
did.
a
group
that
they
were
associated
with
did.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
it
was
denied.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
it
was
denied
on
a
discretionary
basis
because
it
was
late
and
because
of
this...
what
they
viewed
as
this
congressional
remedy.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
no,
your
honor,
because
it
was
not
litigated,
and...
it
was
not
litigated.
we
made
the
claim,
but
they
would
not...
they
would
not
let
us
put
on
evidence
in
the
indian
claims
commission.
in
fact,
they
refused
to
let
us
put
on
evidence.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
well,
if
it
is
not
litigated...
ch,
res...
i
am
sorry.
i
misunderstood
the
question.
this
is
a
different
claim
on
that
issue.
i
am
sorry.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
issue...
i
think
that
this
is
a
separate
claim,
particularly
with...
i
do
not
believe
that
in
an
entirely
different
claim
you
can
be
held
to
a
determination
by
the
court
that
you
are
complaining
about.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
that
we
had
a
right
to
intervene
because
they
were
giving
up
title
to
land
that
we
wanted...
that
we
said
was
not
taken.
we
said
there
was
collusion,
because
land
that
was
not
taken
was...
that
the
parties
were
stipulating
that
lands
were
taken
which
were
not
taken.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
that
there
was
collusion,
yes.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
i
do
not
believe
that
we
are
precluded
on
the
matters
asserted
by
the
association
that
we
were
connected
with.
i
believe
that
we
are
not
precluded
in
this
separate
claim
that
is
before
this
court,
this
trespass
case.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
as
i
stated,
i
do
not
feel
that
we
were
allowed
to
litigate
them
in
a
real
sense,
but
even
if
we
were,
this
is
a
separate
claim,
your
honor,
and
i
am
asserting
that.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
yes.
and
i
think
i
can
explain
that
a
little
bit
better
as
i
go
along.
the
second
problem
with
the
finding
of
the
commission
regarding
the
representative
is
that
the
representative
was
to
represent
the
interests
of,
and
i
quote
here,
"the
descendants
of
the
western
shoshone
identifiable
group.
"
not
the
interests
of
the
property
holder
which
the
indian
claims
commission
said
was
this
identifiable
group
back
in
the
past
was
the
property
holder.
then
the
only
parties
who
are
represented
are
the
descendants,
people
who
have
an
interest
in
establishing
that
the
property
holder
is
dead,
if
you
will.
it
is
like
a
probate
hearing
where
a
person...
the
deceased
comes
in
and
says,
i
am
alive,
and
only
the
heirs
are
represented.
only
descendants
of
the
property
owner
are
represented.
they
draw
the
analogy
to
a
corporation.
it
would
be
a
fight
over
the
corporation
assets
where
only
remainder
interests,
say,
creditors,
or
your
special
type
of
stockholders,
and
the
board
of
directors
was
not
before
them,
just
the
descendants
of
the
property
holder.
this
is
because
of
the
nature
of
the
indian
claims
commission.
as
the
associate
solicitor
of
the
interior
department
reported
in
a
report
about
this
claim,
the
assumption
was
that
the
lands
were
taken
and
there
was
no
accommodation
for
people
who
asserted
property
interests.
there
is
a
profound
difference,
and
several
members
of
this
court
in
various
cases
have
noted
this,
between
the
sort
of
litigation
that
is
going
on
in
the
claims
commission,
where
they
are
dealing
in
windfall,
really,
for
something
that
happened
to
somebody's
ancestors,
or
reparation
for
something
that
happened
long
ago,
and
fundamental
possessory
property
rights,
which
we
are
litigating
in
this
case,
and
that
gets
me
to
our
third
argument,
and
it
is
in
the
alternative,
our
individual
property
rights,
regardless
of
western
shoshone
title.
the
danns
have
asserted
individual
title
and
this
court
has
held
in
the
cramer
case
and
in
santa
fe
versus
pacific
those
survive
the
tribal
claim.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
but
that
would
make
no
difference,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
what
your
honor
is
going
to
is
this
idea
that
there
is
some
language
in
some
cases
that
it
is...
aboriginal
title
is
good
against
everyone
but
the
government.
is
that--
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
--i
would
like
to
address
that,
because
that
is
a
very
important
problem.
in
lane
versus
pueblo
santa
rosa,
your
honor,
the
secretary...
now,
that
is
a
tribal
aboriginal
title
question.
all
right?
in
that
case,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
restrained,
an
injunction
was
issued
against
him
from
interfering
or
using
indian
title
lands
as
if
they
were
not.
here
is
the
confusion.
it
is,
the
executive
branch
cannot,
has
to
respect
western
shoshone
aboriginal
title
or
individual
title.
this
is
the
distinction.
this
court
has
held
in
past
decisions,
and
i
hope
it
is
not
currently
the
law,
but
it
has
held
in
past
decisions
that
congress
can
do
anything
it
wants
with
aboriginal
title.
it
can
confiscate
it.
but
it
is
only
congress.
this
is
a
division
of
powers
question
again.
the
executive
branch
has
to
respect
indian
title
as
if
it
were
fee
simple,
almost.
they
hold
the
fee,
but
they
do.
so,
you
can
assert
aboriginal
title
against
the
government,
and
that
is
quite
clear,
and
this
court
so
held
in
the
lane
case.
in
the
santa
fe
case,
they
held,
the
court
held,
this
court
held
that
the
aboriginal
tribal
title
had
been
relinquished,
but
noted
that
that
would
have
no
preclusive
effect
on
the
assertion
of
individual
indian
title,
and
individual
indian
title
is
that
which...
in
that
case
they
were
referring
to
is
any
indians
who
stayed
on
the
land
and
used
it.
now,
in
the
cramer
case,
they
were
talking
about
a
farm,
but
these
fields,
and
they
are
used
year-round...
this
is
year-round
pasturage.
we
are
not
using
it
like
most
permittees
use
bureau
of
land
management
lands.
the
cattle
are
on
this
land
year-round.
if
they
cannot
use
that
land,
the
cattle
will
have
to
go.
this
little
homestead
would...
they
couldn't
put
all
the
cattle
on
that
homestead
and
even
feed
them
hay.
it
couldn't
by
physically
done.
these
lands
are
as
important
to
this
ranching
operation,
this
three-generation
old
business
as
the
farmer's
fields
which
were
enclosed
in
a
fence
in
the
farmlands
of
california.
mr.
john
d.
o'connell
thank
you.
