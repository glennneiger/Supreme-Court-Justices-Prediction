mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
--thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
comes
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
concerns
the
finality
effect
of
section
22(a)
of
the
indian
claims
commission
act.
section
22(a)
states
that
payment
of
a
claim
in
accordance
with
the
act
"shall
be
full
discharge
of
the
united
states
of
all
claims
and
demands
touching
any
of
the
matters
involved
in
the
controversy.
"
the
court
below,
the
ninth
circuit,
determined
that
payment
had
not
taken
place
in
accordance
with
section
22(a).
we
believe
that
that
decision
was
in
error
and
should
be
reversed.
after
a
short
statement
of
the
facts,
we
will
explain
why
we
feel
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
consequences
of
such
a
reversal.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
the
respondents
would
state
that
there
needs
to
be
congressional--
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
--no,
there
is
not.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
in
this
case,
it
is
important
to
know
there
were
actually
two
cases,
one,
the
first
case
before
the
indian
claims
commission,
and
the
second
case,
this
one
here,
both
in
which...
both
involved
a
claim
of
title,
specifically,
western
shoshone
title
to
lands
in
nevada.
here,
the
respondents
have
a
patented
homestead
in
nevada,
and
on
that
homestead
land,
which
is
not
in
dispute
here,
they
have
their
homes,
they
have
other
structures,
they
have
fenced
in
areas,
and
indeed
they
have
their
water
supply
for
their
cattle
operation.
it
is
on
contiguous
federal
public
lands
next
to
the
homestead
that
they
have
had
their
cattle
grazing
without
a
permit,
a
bureau
of
land
management
permit.
it
is
because
they
have
been
grazing
without
a
permit
that
we
find
that
wrongful,
and
it
is
because
of
that
that
we
brought
the
ejectment
action
which
started
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
the
only
remaining
thing
here,
it
is
our
position,
is
that
congress
will
eventually
have
to
take
an
affirmative
action,
affirmatively
act
to
pass
legislation
to
distribute,
to
distribute
funds
that
have
already
been
paid.
we
draw
major
significance
and
a
distinction
between
payment
and
distribution,
but
that
is
the
act
that
congress
would
have
to
deal
with,
is
distribution.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
no,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
what
we
have
here
is
the
finality
provisions
of
22(a),
and
specifically
if,
as
we
believe,
22(a)
has
been
satisfied,
payment
has
taken
place,
then
the
respondents
here
are
precluded
from
using
a
claim
of
title,
western
shoshone
title
as
a
defense
in
the
action
started
here,
the
ejectment
action
brought
by
the
government.
and
so
that
remains
to
still
require
them
to
get
a
permit
to
graze
on
federal
public
lands.
the
defense,
as
i
just
mentioned,
that
was
brought
up
and
brought
forward
by
the
respondents
was
that
they
were
western
shoshone
indians,
that
they
had
western
shoshone
title
to
the
lands,
and
because
of
that
they
had
a
right
to
use
and
occupy
the
lands
in
question.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
well,
you
are
correct,
but
we
have
had
a
long
history
in
this
country
of
trying
to
resolve
indian
matters
in
a
fair
and
understanding
way.
in
this
case,
indian
title,
aboriginal
title
was
title
for
nothing
more,
as
this
court
has
found
before,
nothing
more
than
really
an
occupancy
as
and
between
indians.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
it
should
be.
yes,
your
honor.
but
that
was
the
defense
that
was
put
forward
here.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
it
is
claimed
that
aboriginal
title,
that
they
have
aboriginal
title--
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
--mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
am
not
sure
that
they
may
have
given
up
any
other
claim,
but
certainly
before
the
indian
claims
commission.
the
indian
claims
commission
was
designed
and
established
only
to
consider
tribal
claims
and
not
individual
claims,
and
here,
they
are
using
a
claim
of
tribal
title
as
their
defense
against
the
ejectment
action.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
that
is
correct,
and
that
was
after
eleven
years
of
listening
to
anthropologists
and
taking
evidence.
they
found
that
the
aboriginal
title,
the
indian...
the
western
shoshone
title
had
been
extinguished
some
time
prior
to
1946.
and
it
is
that
extinguishment
in
which
we
concur.
we
believe
that
they
do
not
have
western
shoshone
title,
and
that
that
had
been
extinguished,
that
the
claim
has
been...
a
claim
was
brought
by
the
western
shoshone
to
the
indian
claims
commission
based
on
the
extinguishment
of
western
shoshone
title.
that
was
litigated.
it
has
been
paid.
and
therefore
the
finality
section
of
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
section
22(a),
has
gone
into
effect,
and
there
is
a...
the
united
states
is
now...
has
full
discharge
against
any
claim
that
would
come
out
of
that
particular--
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
--we
believe
that
the
government
has
gone.
what
has
happened
is
that
when
the
congress
set
up
the
indian
claims
commission,
they
set
up
the
process
for
the
hearings.
all
that
has
taken
place.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
section
22(a)
establishes
that
a
judgment
of
the
indian
claims
commission
is
as
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims,
and
that...
and
then
congress
has
provided
subsequent
to
the
establishment
of
the
indian
claims
commission
that
the
appropriation,
the
appropriation
that
would
satisfy
that
judgment
is
an
automatic
appropriation.
it
is
done
automatically.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
the
respondents
have
argued
some
other
statutes
that
really
go
to
distribution
and
not
to
payment.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
section
i
believe
it
is
25
usc
118
that
they
cite
is
really
a...
it's
a
1911
statute
that
deals
with
payment.
it
does
not
define
payment.
it
certainly
is
clearly
not
dealing
with
payment
under
the
indian
claims
commission.
and
in
this
case,
the
congress
has,
in
fact,
subsequent
to
that
statute,
established
a
very
meticulous
procedure
for
the
entire
consideration,
presentment
and
consideration,
judgment
and
appropriation.
and
at
the
time
they
passed
the
act,
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
they
did
provide,
they,
congress,
that
a
ministerial
act
of
appropriating
the
money
would
have
to
take
place,
but
even
that
has
been
done
away
with,
and
is
now
an
automatic
appropriation.
that
automatic
appropriation
did
take
effect,
and
that
is
not
in
dispute
here.
both
sides
agree
that
the
appropriation
has
taken
effect.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
the
money
has
been
placed
in
a
trust
account
in
the--
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
--yes,
the
secretary
of
treasury
knows
the
money
is
there.
yes,
the
money
is
in
the
treasury.
it
is
in
a
trust
account.
it
is
earning
money,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
substantially.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
it
is
tribal
money.
there
is
a
vested
property
right
by
the
claimant,
the
payee,
and
we
hold
it,
we,
the
government,
hold
it
as
trustees
for
their
beneficial
interest.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
well,
for
the
claimant,
the
western
shoshone
identifiable
group.
now,
going
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
what
now
still
remains
to
be
done
is
not
to
pay
the
money.
the
money
has
been
paid
to
the
payee.
the
government
is
no
longer
a
judgment
creditor.
what
will
need
to
be
done
now
is
to
resolve
how
to
distribute
that
money
to
individuals,
a
separate
act,
subsequent
payment.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
it
is...
a
lot
of
different
things
are
possible.
what
we
think
is
very
prudent
here
is
that
we
wait
and
try
and
resolve
and
get
a
consensus
among
the
indians
that
are
included
in
that
identifiable
group,
and
base
a
distribution
plan
upon
a
consensus
opinion
of
those
indians.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
they
have
not
been
paid
anything.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
the
tribe,
the
western
shoshone
identifiable
group
has
been
paid
money.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
based
on
tribal
title,
yes.
based
on
tribal
title.
and
that
is
our
fundamental
point,
is
that
tribal
title
has
been
extinguished,
and
indeed
compensation
for
that
extinguishment
has
now
taken
place
under
section
22(a).
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
well,
we
would
contend
that
aboriginal
title
is
a
tribal
title,
but
the
indians
certainly
could
in
the
situation
that
you
have
put
forward
make
that
claim
based
on
that
tribal
title.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
not
as
long
as
they
are
basing
it
on
tribal
title.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
they
may
have
an
individual
title,
but
they
have
not
asserted
that
there.
they
may
have
some
other
theory.
indeed,
the
respondents'
brief,
although
not
raising
this
at
the
court
of
appeals,
claims
under
the
supreme
court's
case
in
cramer
that
they
may
have
some
individual,
separate
and
apart
from
western
shoshone
title,
but
that,
the
finding
in
cramer
of
title
requires
an
evidentiary
submission
by
them
that
was
not
done
here,
and
a
finding
of
facts
that
just
aren't
present
in
this
case.
but
that
would
go
to
whether
or
not
they
might
be
able
to
assert
some
individual
title,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
the
western
shoshone
title.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
well,
i
think
it
is
important
that
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
indian
claims
commission
when
it
was
set
up,
it
established
a
specific
procedure
for
who
could
come
forward
and
submit
claims,
and
indeed
it
did
provide
that
indians,
individual
indians
could
come
forward,
bands,
tribes,
but
it
did
also
have,
as
took
place
in
this
case,
that
in
the
instance
where
that
identifiable
group
of
indians
had
among
it
a
recognized
tribe,
a
recognized
tribe
under
the
1934
indian
reorganization
act,
that
entity
would
be
the
exclusive
agent
or
representative
before
the
commission.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
well,
there
are
some
similarities,
but
not...
but
really
the
indian
claims
commission
is
a
creature
of
the
statute
itself,
and
provided
for
a
specific
procedure,
specific
representation
appeals,
and
all
of
those
were
used
in
this
case.
so,
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
final
judgment
of
the
indian
claims
commission
was
certified
by
the
general
accounting
office.
it
was
then
automatically
appropriated.
the
moneys
were
automatically
appropriated,
and
that
payment
then
put
into
effect
the
finality
provisions
of
section
22(a).
the
respondents
do
argue
that
payment
awaits
that
payment
really
didn't
happen.
it
distribution,
won't
happen
until
distribution.
but
as
i
said
earlier,
we
find
a
major
distinction
between
the
appropriation,
the
payment,
and
distribution.
this
court,
i
might
add,
in
its
decision
in
v.
weeks,
a
case
which
is
ignored
totally
by
respondents
in
their
brief,
found
that
very
specific
thing,
that
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
payment
is
separate
and
apart
from
distribution.
payment
is
a
payment
of
a
tribal
claim,
and
subsequently
there
can
be
a
distribution
to
individuals.
we
also...
i
would
say
the
legislative
history
makes
it
pretty
clear
that
congress
intended
section
22(a)
to
be
a
final...
an
act
of
finality.
those
provisions
were
there
to
bring
finality
to
the
whole
process.
indeed,
it
was
a
very
conscious
decision
by
congress,
because
the
department
of
justice
in
fact
went
before
congress
and
criticized
that
very
provision,
went
up
and
said,
you
shouldn't
pass
it,
it
is
not
a
good
idea,
because
in
passing
that
provision,
what
you
would
be
doing,
congress,
is
surrendering
your
prerogative
to
review
all
the
claims
coming
against
the
united
states--
unfortunately,
this
happens
every
once
in
a
while.
congress
did
not
pay
attention
to
our
advice,
and
specifically
kept
22(a)
in
the
statute
for
the
express
purpose
of
providing
the
finality
that
they
desired.
and
i
also
would
add
that
the
respondents
have
made
an
argument
that
they
had
not
been
accorded
due
process
under
the
indian
claims
commission
activities,
and
the
hearings
there.
the
respondent
is
wrong.
that
is
absolutely
incorrect
on
two
grounds.
first
of
all,
respondents
did
not
raise
a
due
process
argument
at
the
court
of
appeals
level,
so
it
is
not
really
properly
before
this
court.
but
secondly,
due
process
was
provided.
it
was
provided
by
the
whole
procedure
that
was
established
by
congress
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act.
the
indians
could
come
forward
and
present
claims.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
yes,
they
did.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
we
feel
that
they
are,
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
feel
that
they
are
precluded.
they
had
their
adversarial
hearing.
they
had
all
the
appeals.
they
used
the
appeals.
and
it
is
not
a
lack
of
due
process
if
you
have
not
timely
used
the
processes
that
have
been
provided.
and
finally,
i
would
need
to
make
the
point
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
the
only
effect
and
impact
on
the
respondents,
the
individual
respondents
here
would
be
that
they
will
need
to
get
a
bureau
of
land
management
grazing
permit
to
put
their
cattle
on
the
lands
contiguous
to
their
homestead,
homestead
lands
in
nevada.
i
will
reserve
further--
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
respondent
raised
issued
of
damages
in
his
argument
before
lunch,
and
it
has
been
determined,
and
i
wanted
to
inform
this
court...
i
have
been
authorized
to
do
so...
that
the
government
will
not
try
to
collect
damages
for
trespass
prior
to
the
determination
of
this
case.
also,
justice
stevens
raised
the
question
of
the
permits,
grazing
permits,
and
justice
o'connor
properly
noted
that
the
fee
is
based
upon
the
head
of
cattle
on
the
land,
and
for
the
court's
information,
as
of
january,
1984,
the
fee
was
$1.37
per
animal
unit
per
month.
i
would
also
point
out
that
under
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
interior,
that
if
the
cattle
grazing
is
for
subsistence
purposes
only,
of
people
living
on
contiguous
lands,
as
here,
there
are
provisions
for
application
for
a
free
permit
for
that
grazing.
and
finally,
in
an
exchange
with
justice
rehnquist...
i
want
to
reference
back
to
that
exchange.
i
want
to
clarify
that
one
aspect
of
the
government's
position,
our
submission
really
does
not
depend
on
the
proposition
that
the
mere
filing
of
the
ejection
action
extinguished
aboriginal
title.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
well,
we
would
feel
that
in
this
case
just
filing
the
ejection
action,
of
course,
was
us,
the
government
acting
in
its
litigative
capacity,
and
anything
else
is
really
not
before
us
here
in
this
case,
and
that
we
feel
that
you
need
to...
the
government
should
properly,
as
i
indicated
when
we
had
the
exchange,
try
to
deal
in
fairness,
and
that
was
what
actually
took
place
here,
and
title
had
already
been
extinguished.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
i
think
that
aboriginal
title
can
be
taken
by
the
government,
and
can
be
taken
without
compensation.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
no,
we
believe
there
needs
to
be
action
by
the
congress
to
take
without
any
compensation.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
that
is
correct.
we
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
justice
stevens,
i
am
going
to
have
to
apologize.
i
am
not
sure
in
the
analogy
whether
it
would,
but
i
can
come
back
to
this
situation
where
have
the
judgment
paid
and
it
is
in
the
trust
fund
and
being
held
by
the
government
as
trustee
for
the
western
shoshone
identifiable
group.
in
the
exchange
that
took
place
in
the
respondent's
argument,
we
would
adopt,
as
we
said
before,
we
adopt
the
position
that
we
certainly
are
no
longer
debtors.
we
have
paid
it.
the
vested
right
is
in
that
group,
and
any
person
that
falls
within
the
category
of
the
western
shoshone
identifiable
group
could
in
fact
bring
a
case
and
charge
trying
to
have
distribution
or
any
other
action,
if
it
was
mismanaged,
if
the
government
mismanaged
it.
the
chief
justice
made
the
point
correctly
that
funds
in
a
trust
account
cannot
be
under
any
circumstances
taken
back
by
the
government.
it
is
now
the--
mr.
robert
a.
mc
connell
--but
the
payment,
the
claim
submitted,
the
judgment,
and
then
the
payment
was
for
a
wrong,
if
you
will,
an
action
that
affected
the
tribal
entity,
the
western
shoshone
identifiable
group,
not
individual
members
as
such.
