justice
white
i
take
it
that,
does
the
government...
do
you
understand
the
government
to
concede
that
if
tiffany
had
not
been
under
audit,
that
it
could
not
have
summoned
tiffany
to
produce
the
names
of
its
customers
without
going
through
the
john
doe
procedure?
justice
white
but
do
you
think
that
getting
the
names
of
the
customers
and
investigating
the
customers
would
help
the
government
determine
tiffany's
obligation?
if
the
interest
to
the
government
is
the
fact
that
tiffany
allegedly
was
selling
tax
shelters,
i
suppose
it
might
help...
if
the
government
thought
tiffany
was
doing
it
illegally
or
contrary
to
the
law
or
something,
i
suppose
it
would
help
to
know
who
the
customers
are
and
what
their
affairs
might
show.
justice
white
it
wouldn't?
justice
white
why,
if
they're
under
audit?
justice
white
would
it
help...
i'll
put
it
this
way.
would
it
help
the
government
conclude
its
audit
of
tiffany?
justice
white
well,
if
it
knows
who
they
are.
justice
white
if
they
know
who
they
are.
justice
white
but
i
guess
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
proceed
on
this
basis
anyway.
they
assumed
that
there
was
a
dual
purpose,
i
suppose.
justice
white
and
so
that
even
if
the
irs
wanted
the
names
of
the
customers,
wholly
aside
from
its
audit
of
tiffany,
the
court
of
appeals
held
they
were
entitled
to
get
it.
justice
white
well,
all
the
argument
is
then
that
the
government
could
easily
satisfy
the
john
doe
proceedings,
the
john
doe
summons.
they
could
always
get
it.
they
could
always
say
well,
it's
tiffany.
justice
white
so
why
have
they
got
an
objection
to
going
through
the
procedure?
justice
white
--mr.
wallace,
let's
just
assume
that
the
names
of
the
customers
were
completely
irrelevant
to
tiffany's
audit
or
tiffany's
liability,
and
that
tiffany
said,
well,
why
do
you
want
these
names?
and
the
irs
said,
well,
we
don't
want
them
because
we're
investigating
you;
we
just
want
them
because
you've
got
them.
and
we
want
to
investigate
them.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
third
party
summons?
justice
white
do
you
suggest...
do
you
say
that...
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
names
of
the
customers
were
relevant
to
the
investigation
of
tiffany?
justice
white
so
you
would
say
it
would
be
a
third
party
summons,
if
in
this
case--
justice
white
--the
names
of
the
customers
were
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
investigation
of
tiffany.
justice
white
yes.
all
right.
justice
white
but
it's
also...
but
we
also
judge
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
irs
may
have
been
interested
in
the
tax
liabilities
of
the
customers
also.
