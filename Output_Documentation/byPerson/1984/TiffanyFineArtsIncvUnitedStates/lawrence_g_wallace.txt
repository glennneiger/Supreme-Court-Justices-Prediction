mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
our
starting
point
in
this
case
is
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
a
third
party
summons
in
this
case.
it
is
what
is
known
in
tax
practice
as
a
taxpayer
summons.
it
was
a
summons
issued
to
tiffany
and
its
subsidiaries,
and
it
names
tiffany
and
its
subsidiaries
as
the
taxpayer
whose
liability
is
under
examination
in
this
summons.
a
major
focus
of
the
proceedings
below
was
to
determine
whether
this
was
a
summons
legitimately
issued
for
that
purpose,
and
whether
the
records
and
information
requested
were
properly
producible
for
that
purpose.
that
phase
of
the
case
was
litigated
under
the
standards
first
articulated
in
united
states
v.
powell
and
reiterated
many
times
by
this
court,
and
was
quite
properly,
that
part
of
the
case,
litigated
the
same
way
it
would
have
been
litigated
prior
to
1976
when
all
of
section
7609
first
came
into
the
statute.
and
there
were
affidavits
submitted
by
the
agent
on
this
question.
the
criteria
of
the
powell
case
are
very
succinctly
stated
in
that
case
itself.
they
are
something
less
than
probable
cause,
the
court
said.
all
the
commissioner
must
show
is
that
the
investigation
is
conducted
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
purpose;
that
the
inquiry
may
be
relevant...
he
doesn't
have
to
show
that
it
is
relevant,
it
may
be
relevant
to
that
purpose...
and
that
the
information
sought
is
not
already
within
the
commissioner's
possession;
that
the
administrative
steps
required
by
the
code
have
been
followed,
and
that
it
has
not
been
issue
for
an
improper
purpose.
and
the
examples
given
were
to
harass
the
taxpayer
or
put
pressure
on
him
to
settle
a
collateral
dispute.
and
the
combination
of
the
agent's
affidavits
and
the
legal
argument
by
the
united
states
attorney
showed
that
the
agent
felt
that
he
had
to
be
able
to
trace
transactions
from
source
documents
to
books
of
account,
and
he
would
need
knowledge
of
the
names
of
the
licensees
or
the
customers
for
this
purpose,
and
also--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
haven't
quite
finished
the
reasons,
if
i
may.
and
also
to
reconcile
reported
income
with
deposits
and
receivables
and
to
verify
that
the
transactions
reported
by
the
petitioners
actually
were
the
transactions
that
occurred.
and
this
was
soundly
based
on
based
on
principles
that
this
court
established
in
holland
v.
the
united
states
back
in
348
u.s.,
one
of
the
leading
tax
cases,
the
net
worth
tax
case
in
which
the
court
pointed
out
that
certainly
congress
never
intended
in
the
provision
there
at
issue,
which
was
one
that
limited
the
government's
authority
to
deviate
from
the
taxpayer's
method
of
accounting,
certainly
the
government...
congress
never
intended
to
make
that
provision
a
set
of
blinders
which
prevents
the
government
from
looking
beyond
the
self-serving
declarations
in
a
taxpayer's
books.
to
protect
the
revenue
from
those
who
do
not
render
true
accounts,
the
government
must
be
free
to
use
all
legal
evidence
available
to
it
in
determining
whether
the
story
told
by
the
taxpayer's
books
accurately
reflects
his
financial
history.
and,
in
light
of
those
legitimate
purposes,
showing
of
why
these
names
be
relevant
to
the
audit
of
tiffany
and
its
subsidiaries,
the
courts
enforced
the
summons,
applying
the
powell
standard.
the
district
court,
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals,
under
concurrent
factual
findings,
ruled
that
this
would
have
been
an
enforceable
summons
prior
to
1976.
and
the
legal
question
before
this
court
is
whether
anything
in
the
tax
reform
act
of
1976,
which
added
section
7609,
should
change
that
result.
and
we
think
the
answer
to
that
question
emerges
with
the
greatest
clarity
if
we
look
at
section
7609
as
a
whole,
as
a
package,
because
it
was
treated
by
congress
as
a
package
and
discussed
in
the
committee
reports
as
a
package.
before
turning
specifically
to
7609(f),
the
first
provisions
in
7609
dealt
with
notice
and
rights
to
intervene
for
certain
identified
persons.
and
there
are
two
aspects
of
section
7609
that
make
it
highly
implausible
that
congress
would
have
wanted
or
would
have
intended
that
statute
to
change
the
result
that
you
would
have
reached
under
the
powell
standards
prior
to
its
enactment.
one
is
that
the
very
title
of
section
7609,
which
says
"special
procedure
for
third
party
summonses.
"
that
is
part
of
the
statute.
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
outset,
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
third
party
summons.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
special
procedures
that
congress
adopted
for
third
party
summonses
should
change
the
result
that
would
have
been
reached
with
respect
to
a
taxpayer's
summons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
a
third
party
summons
with
respect
to
that
request,
but
what
i
pointed
out
is
that
that...
the
question
whether
the
request
for
that
information
was
properly
producible
as
a
taxpayer...
as
part
of
the
taxpayer
summons...
is
precisely
what
was
litigated
below
and
upheld
by
concurrent
factual
findings
of
both
courts
below
in
this
case;
that
that
information
did
fit
the
powell
criteria
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right.
that's
what
we
had
to
show.
that
was
the
theory
on
which
we
proceeded
with
the
7602
summons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
another--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
another
means
by
which
we
might
try
to
get
the
same
information
for
a
different
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
we
proceeded
under
section
7602
and
we
had
to
make
the
powell
showing
that
it
was...
that
it
may
be
relevant
to
tiffany's
liability,
and
that's
what
we
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
irs
should
be
interested
in
everybody's
tax
liabilities.
yes.
but
their
right
to
compel
production
of
this
information
was
pursuant
to
an
audit
that
was
assigned
to
this
agent,
and
his
assignment
was
to
audit
tiffany
and
its
subsidiaries,
and
that's
the
purpose
for
which
he
asked
for.
and
he
made
the
proper
showing
in
support
of
that
purpose.
what
the
agent
does
is
just
copy
onto
the
summons
form
his
assignment.
he
is
assigned
audit,
their
liability,
and
he
copies
that
as
the
taxpayer
that
it's
material
to.
now,
the
second
aspect
of
7609
that
makes
it
highly
implausible
that
congress
meant
to
change
the
result
that
would
be
reached
under
powell
with
respect
to
a
taxpayer
summons
is
that
congress
enacted
in
7609
provisions
directly
dealing
with
summons
enforcement
proceedings
and
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
those
provisions,
where
they
gave
some
additional
taxpayer
standing
to
contest
summons
enforcement
proceedings,
showed
that
congress
informed
itself
in
detail
of
the
substantive
standards
that
this
court
had
developed,
and
explicitly
said
that
they
did
not
want
to
change
them
in
any
respect.
they
did
not
want
to
expand
any
rights
to
resist
the
production
of
information.
they
just
wanted
to
enable
these
additional
people
to
raise
the
same
issues
that
the
party
summoned
could
be
able
to
raise.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
think
it
would
change
the
case.
the
whole
case
is
being
litigated
on
a
premise
that
somehow
congress
implied
by
enacting
this
provision
that
there's
something
improper
about
the
service's
using
information
that
legitimately
comes
into
its
possession
with
respect
to
one
taxpayer,
if
it
shows
something
about
another
taxpayer;
there's
something
improper
about
using
it
for
purposes
of
pursuing
or
initiating
an
investigation
about
that
other
taxpayer.
the
whole
code
is
built
on
the
contrary
premise;
that
it's
up
to
the
service
to
pursue
whatever
information
comes
into
its
possession
that
shows
that
the
tax
laws
are
not
being
complied
with.
i
mean
there
is
even
a
provision
in
the
code,
section
7623,
which
authorizes
regulations
which
have
been
adopted
that
provide
for
rewards
for
information
that
comes
to
the
service
showing
that
somebody
has
committed
tax
fraud.
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
interpret
the
statute
as
if
somehow
the
service
has
its
hands
in
the
cookie
jar
if
it's
legitimately
pursuing
an
audit
and
discovers
that
someone
else
also
may
not
have
paid
the
taxes
that
they
were
supposed
to
pay.
the
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
they
said...
but
all
of
that
was
said
in
the
context
of
a
third
party
summons
and
against
legislative
history
saying
that
this
third
party
record
keeper,
who
isn't
himself
under
investigation,
won't
have
the
incentive
to
make
the
claims
against
enforceability
of
the
summons
that
are
available
under
the
law,
and
therefore,
there
should
be
a
safeguard.
and
the
package
of
safeguards
that
they
enacted
was
7609.
first,
a
provision,
when
you
identify
the
person
really
under
investigation,
the
person
or
persons,
you're
supposed
to
notify
them
in
certain
circumstances
and
give
them
a
chance
to
intervene
and
raise
not
some
additional
defense,
but
just
the
defenses
that
the
summoned
person
could
have
raised
if
he
had
an
interest
in
raising
them.
and
then
in
7609(f),
they
said
and
if
there's
nobody
that
you
can
identify,
that
you
can
bring
into
court,
then
we'll
substitute
an
ex
parte
hearing
before
the
judge,
and
you
have
to
be
able
to
show
that
the
criterion
of
(f)
have
been
met
in
order
to
issue
the
summons.
this
is
not
even
in
the
enforcement
proceeding.
this
is
just
issue.
all
other
summonses
can
be
issued
administratively,
and
the
question
is
what
are
the
standards
in
the
enforcement
proceedings
with
respect
to
the
others.
now,
both
aspects
of
7609
were
responsive
to
decisions
of
this
court.
the
provisions
in
parts
a
and
b
were
responsive
to
this
court's
decision
in
donaldson
v.
the
united
states,
in
which
it
held
that
a
taxpayer
under
audit,
under
investigation,
had
no
standing
to
intervene
in,
no
right
to
intervene
in
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding
against
his
former
employer,
where
the
service
was
seeking
information
about
him
from
the
employer.
congress
did
not
overrule
donaldson
in
that
factual
context
at
all.
congress
was
not
concerned
with
the
service's
uncontested
access
to
employer
records.
it
was
bank
records
and
records
in
which
there
might
be
claims
of
privilege
of
similar
sorts
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
it
was
only
the
american
bankers
association
that
testified
in
favor
of
this
legislation.
and
so
congress
limited
the
record
keepers,
the
category
of
record
keepers,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
to
whom
these
provisions
apply.
it
defined
the
third
party
record
keepers
here
as...
various
categories
of
banks,
consumer
reporting
agencies,
persons
extending
credit
through
credit
cards,
brokers
under
the
securities
exchange
act,
attorneys,
accountants,
and
then
later
added
barter
exchanges.
and
it's
only
if
the
third
party
summons
is
issued
to
one
of
these
kinds
of
record
keepers
that
the
notice
provision
goes
out
and
that
there's
a
right
to
intervene
in
the
enforcement
proceeding.
and
both
the
house
and
senate
committee
reports
made
it
clear,
very
explicitly,
that
the
standards
to
be
applied,
the
defenses
to
be
raised
were
not
to
be
expanded
at
all.
they
said
that
the
taxpayer
is
allowed
to
intervene
to
assert
the
defenses
which
are
available
under
present
law,
but
would
have
standing
to
raise
issues
which
could
be
asserted
by
the
third
party
record
keeper.
and
it
specified:
such
as
asserting
that
the
summons
is
ambiguous,
vague,
or
other
deficient
in
describing
the
material
requested;
or
that
the
material
requested
was
not
relevant
to
a
lawful
investigation.
in
other
words,
the
committee
intends
that
the
noticee
will
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
third
party
record
keeper
and
assert
certain
defenses
to
enforcement
which
witnesses
are
traditionally
allowed
to
claim,
but
which
may
not
be
available
to
intervenors
under
many
court
decisions
on
ground
of
standing.
at
the
same
time,
it
should
be
made
clear
that
the
purpose
of
this
procedure
is
to
facilitate
the
opportunity
of
the
noticee
to
raise
defenses
which
are
already
available
under
the
law,
and
that
these
provisions
are
not
intended
to
expand
the
substantive
rights
of
these
parties,
the
noticee
or
the
third
party
witness.
and
they
even
add
that
the
noticee
will
not
be
permitted
to
assert
defenses
that
affect
only
the
interests
of
the
third
party
record
keeper,
such
as
improper
service
on
the
third
party
record
keeper,
or
undue
burdensomeness
in
complying
with
it.
so
congress
informed
itself,
very
carefully,
of
the
standards
this
court
had
developed
in
powell
and
its
progeny,
and
merely
wanted
to
allow
identified
taxpayers
to
raise
the
same
defenses
in
certain
circumstances
where
they
would
be
precluded
by
the
rule
of
donaldson
from
doing
so.
now,
the
fact
that
this
was
to
apply
only
to
third
party
summonses
is
made
further
clear
by
a
provision
we
quote
on
page
20
of
our
brief,
just
above
the
middle
of
the
page,
subpart
(4)
of
it,
which
says
that
this
whole
provision,
the
notice
and
the
intervention
provisions,
shall
not
apply
to
any
summons
served
on
the
person
with
respect
to
whose
liability
the
summons
is
issued.
so
it
isn't
only
the
title
that
says
that
these
provisions
have
been
put
in
solely
for
third
party
summonses.
there
is
an
explicit
exception
with
respect
to
that
aspect
of
it.
the
significant
thing
here
is
that
section
7609(f),
then,
the
john
doe
provision,
uses
the
same
language
reaffirming
that
it
refers
only
to
the
third
party
summons
situation,
and
that
is
the
introductory
language
of
7609(f).
and
if
it's
read
in
conjunction
with
the
heading
and
with
the
language
used
in
that
exceptions
provision
in
(a),
it
means
the
same
thing.
i
turn
now
to
the
bottom
of
3a
of
our
briefs
appendix,
but
it's
also
in
some
other
materials,
the
introductory
part
of
7609(f).
"any
summons
described
in
subsection
(c)
which
does
not
identify
the
person
with
respect
to
whose
liability
the
summons
is
issued.
"
that
doesn't
mean
persons
that
the
service
might
also
have
an
interest
in.
it
means
whether
the
summons
identifies
the
taxpayer
whose
liability
is
at
issue
and
is
being
used
to
justify
the
request
for
the
materials
in
the
summons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
may
be
that
there
would
be
a
part
of
it
that
could
not
prevail
under
a
7602
proceeding
on
as
meeting
the
powell
criteria
with
respect
to
our
audit
of
tiffany,
and
if
so,
we
would
have
to
follow
the
7609(f)
procedure.
now,
in
interrelating
these
two
different
parts
of
7609,
it's
significant
in
corroborating
that
this
is
the
right
reading
of
the
statute
to
think
as
a
practical
matter
that
if
we
had,
in
fact,
known
of
the
names
of
some
of
these
licensees
and
requested
not
their
names,
but
requested
all
records
of
transactions
with
licensee
a
and
licensee
b,
those
persons
would
not
have
had
a
right
under
7609(a)
to
notice,
nor
would
they
have
a
right
under
7609(b)
to
intervene,
because
this
is
not
a
third
party
summons.
and
indeed
there
is
also
the
other
problem
that
tiffany
is
not
a
record
keeper
within
the
meaning
of
7609(a)
and
(b)
either.
but
the
more
significant
point
for
our
purposes
is
that
this
is
not
a
third
party
summons,
so
those
persons
would
be
in
no
different
position
than
manufacturer
m
who
might
be
a
supplier
to
tiffany,
and
if
we
ask,
as
you
often
would
in
a
summons,
for
all
records
of

this
particular
supplier,
that
the
supplier
doesn't
have
any
right
to
interfere
with
our
securing
those
records
from
the
taxpayer
who
is
under
audit,
even
though
it's
quite
true
that
those
records
might
tell
us
something
about
possible
tax
liabilities
of
that
supplier.
it's
quite
common
in
conducting
these
audits
for
the
internal
revenue
agent
to
verify
the
information
received
from
one
taxpayer
against
another
taxpayer's
files
and
to
pull
those
files.
it's
part
of
what
he
needs
to
do.
if
a
taxpayer
has
reported
a
sales
transaction
in
which
a
portion
of
the
sales
price
is
attributed
to
goodwill
and
another
portion
to
other
assets,
he
wants
to
see
if
the
other
party
to
the
transaction
has
reported
it
the
same
way.
it
may
be
that
that
will
ultimately
lead
to
his
asking
his
supervisor
to
authorize
an
audit
of
the
second
person
because
he,
as
he
conducts
his
investigation,
discovers
that
the
second
person
may
be
the
one
who
has
not
reported
his
income
properly.
but
that's
what
the
job
of
the
service
is.
and
there
has
never
been
any
impediment
to
the
use
of
other
taxpayer
files
in
conducting
audits
that
are
already
underway.
only
last
term,
this
court
in
the
arthur
young
case
pointed
out
that
to
a
large
degree,
the
effectiveness
of
our
self-reporting
system
of
taxation
depends
on
confidence
of
taxpayers
that
the
service
can
pursue
persons
who
might
not
be
paying
their
fair
share
of
the
tax.
and
there
has
never
been
a
holding
by
this
court
or
any
provision
of
the
tax
laws
which
tells
the
service
that
it
has
to
turn
a
blind
eye
on
information
that
has
properly
come
into
its
possession,
through
legitimate
investigation,
that
may
show
that
some
other
taxpayer
should
also
be
investigated.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
read
the
provisions
at
issue
in
this
case
differently.
they
are
entirely
consistent
with
that
principle.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
our
case
will
be
submitted.
