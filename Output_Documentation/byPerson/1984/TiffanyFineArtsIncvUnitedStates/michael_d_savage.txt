mr.
michael
d.
savage
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
about
one
small
restriction
on
the
power
of
the
irs
to
investigate
people,
the
john
doe
summons
rules
of
section
7609(f).
the
power
is
enormous.
and
what
section
7609(f)
says
is
that
before
the
irs
can
bring
all
of
that
power
to
bear
on
people
whose
identity
it
doesn't
even
know
yet,
first
it
has
to
show
a
court
of
law
that
it
has
a
reasonable
basis
for
wanting
to
investigate
these
people.
the
question
is:
do
those
john
doe
summons
rules
apply
when
the
person
who
can
provide
the
irs
with
the
identities
it
seeks
is
also
a
taxpayer
who
is
under
audit.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
section
7609(a)
does
not
apply
when
section
7609(f)
applies.
section
7609(f)
deals
with
summonses
which
are
seeking
identities
or
information
about
unknown
taxpayers.
section
7609(a)
applies
when
the
irs
has
the
identities
and
is
seeking
information
about
those
people
from
designated
record
keepers.
now,
whether
section
7609(f)
applies
in
this
case
depends
on
how
you
read
that
statute,
how
you
read
section
7609(f),
and
at
first
glance
the
statute
does
seem
ambiguous...
but
only
at
first
glance.
the
problem
is
that
congress
used
the
word
7609(f).
it
said
that
a
summons
is
a
john
doe
summons
if
it
fails
to
identify
the
person
with
respect
to
whose
tax
liability
the
summons
was
issued.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
doubt,
though...
i
don't
think
the
government
would
contend
that
congress
didn't
expect
7609(f)
to
be
used
to
obtain
identities
of
more
than
one
person.
one
of
the
examples
congress
uses
in
the
legislative
history,
one
of
the
examples
it
uses
of
how
the
summons
was
to
be
applied
was
in
the
case
of
a
corporation
in
which
the
irs
was
trying
to
get
the
names
of
the
shareholders
of
a
corporation
who
had
been
advised
that
a
corporate
reorganization
was
a
tax-free
transaction.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
as
long
as
the
summons
identifies
one
person
with
respect
to
whose
tax
liability
it
was
issued,
it's
not
a
john
doe
summons.
but
that
can't
be
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute.
suppose,
in
the
example
of
the
corporation
that
had
advised
taxpayers
that
the
reorganization
was
tax-free,
suppose
that
the
irs
served
a
summons
which
said,
"furnish
us
with
the
letter
that
you
gave
to
john
smith
advising
him
the
transaction
was
tax-free,
and
also
furnish
us
with
the
names
and
addressed
and
social
security
numbers
of
all
the
other
shareholders
in
the
corporation
who
received
the
letter.
"
i
don't
think
the
government
would
contend
that
that
summons
was
not
a
john
doe
summons
simply
because
it
identified
one
of
the
shareholders,
john
smith,
who
the
irs
said
was
under
audit.
so
the
real
problem
with
the
statute
is
that
the
word
"person"
is
used
in
the
singular.
if
the
statute
said
that
a
john
doe
summons
was
a
summons
that
did
not
identify
a
person
or
persons
with
respect
to
whose
tax
liability
it
was
issued,
then
interpreting
the
statute
in
this
case
would
be
much
easier.
but
that
is
clearly
what
the
statute
means.
otherwise,
the
irs
could
get
around
the
john
doe
summons
rules
simply
by
identifying
one
of
tiffany's
customers
who
was
under
investigation.
the
statute
itself
confirms
that
the
word
"person",
the
term
"person"
must
be
read
as
"person"
or
"persons".
the
statute
says
that
it
applies
to
any
summons
described
in
subsection
(c)
of
section
7609.
one
of
the
summonses
described
in
subsection
(c)
of
section
7609
is
a
summons
served
under
section
7602.
one
of
the
summonses...
the
summons
served
under
section
7602
is
your
standard,
run-of-the
mill
summons,
served
on
a
taxpayer
who's
under
audit,
and
who
is
obviously
identified
in
the
summons.
the
summons
served
on
tiffany
fine
arts
was
a
section
7602
summons,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
section
7609(f)
says
quite
clearly
that
it
applies
to
that
kind
of
a
summons.
so
the
language
and
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
not
so
ambiguous
after
all.
now,
the
service
contends
that
section
7609(f)
shouldn't
be
used
to...
shouldn't
be
read
to
interfere
with
its
ability
to
audit
companies
such
as
tiffany,
who
are
taxpayers,
but
who
also
have
information
on
other
taxpayers,
which
is
concededly
of
interest
to
the
service.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
section
7609(f)
can
be
read
in
any
other
way
when
a
purpose
of
the
summons
is
to
identify
those
other
taxpayers,
particularly
if
you
read
"person"
to
mean
"person"
or
"persons",
which
you
must.
but
when
the
service
argues
that
section
7609(f)
shouldn't
be
read
to
interfere
with
its
audit
functions,
it's
really
arguing,
in
effect,
that
it
should
be
permitted
to
determine
all
by
itself
when
section
7609(f)
applies.
and
this
case
shows
exactly
how
that
can
happen.
tiffany
tried
to
show
in
this
case
that
the
whole
thrust
of
the
summons
served
on
it,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
to
audit
its
customers;
that
this
was
the
kind
of
a
summons
which
congress
intended
to
be
covered
by
section
7609(f).
give
me
your
client
list,
the--
mr.
michael
d.
savage
--what
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
did,
your
honor,
was:
it
said
if
a
purpose
of
this
summons
was
to
audit
tiffany
fine
arts,
we
don't
care
whether
there
were
any
other
purposes.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
is
the
wrong
standard.
we
are
suggesting
that
if
a
purpose
of
the
summons
was
to
identify
tiffany's
clients
and
audit
them,
then
even
if
a
purpose
of
the
summons
was
also
to
audit
tiffany
fine
arts,
section
7609(f)
still
applies
only
to
the
question
of
identifying
the
clients.
the
irs
is
free
to
have
all
of
the
other
information
on
tiffany
that
it
wants,
but
it
wants...
and
we're
not
saying
that
it
can't
have
the
client's
identities
either.
but
if
it
wants
the
identities,
section
7609(f)
says
it
has
to
go
through
the
john
doe
summons
procedure.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
our
experience,
your
honor,
is
that
they
get
it.
often.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
under
my
interpretation
of
the
statute,
if
all
they
had
was
a
hunch,
then
no,
they
couldn't
get
the
names
of
these
people.
that's...
in
my
view,
that's
exactly
what
section
7609(f)
is
for:
to
prevent
the
irs
from
auditing
lots
of
people
based
on
a
hunch.
you
know,
i
am
saying
that
if
a
purpose
of
the
summons
is
to--
mr.
michael
d.
savage
--i'm
saying
that
what
7609(f)
says
is
that
if
they
don't
have
any
basis
for
auditing
these
people,
they
may
have
not...
people
who
they
don't
know...
we
are
only
talking
about
people
whose
identities
are
unknown
to
the
service.
if
they
don't
have
any
basis
for
auditing
this
group
of
people,
if
it's
just
a
hunch,
then
that's
right;
section
7609(f)
says
that
they
can't
get
their
names.
now,
they
might
get
into
the
audit
of
the
record
keeper
and,
as
a
result
of
auditing
the
record
keeper,
they
might
come
up
with
a
basis
for
auditing
these
people.
and
then
they
could
go
into
court,
on
the
ex
parte
proceeding.
very
easy
to
get
the
names
of
these
people
under
the
john
doe
summons
procedures.
it's
an
ex
parte
proceeding.
they
tell
the
court
they've
examined
the
record
keeper;
they've
decided
that
everybody
who
has
been
doing
business
with
this
record
keeper
probably
has
underpaid
his
taxes,
and
we
want
a
john
doe
summons.
and
they
would
get
it.
getting
back
to
the
ease
with
which
the
service
can
get
around
the
john
doe
summons
rules
if
they
don't
apply,
when
a
purpose
of
the
summons
is
to
audit
the
record
keeper,
as
we
saw
in
this
case,
tiffany
tried
to
show
this
was
the
kind
of
summons
that
was
covered
by
section
7609(f)
and
the
irs
said
so
what?
tiffany's
under
audit.
we
can't...
we
don't
deny
that
tiffany
was
under
audit.
we
can't
contend
that
tiffany
wasn't
under
audit.
the
irs
is
free
to
put
tiffany
under
audit
whenever
it
wants
to,
for
practically
any
revenue-related
reason
that
it
wants
to.
it
merely
has
to
decide
that
tiffany
is
under
audit,
and
it's
own
power
makes
it
so.
so
it
would
be
easy
to
dispose
of
this
case
as
the
second
circuit
did...
by
reading
the
statute
to
mean
that
as
long
as
somebody
who
is
identified
in
the
summons
is
under
audit,
it
doesn't
matter
how
many
other
people
the
irs
is
interested
in
finding
out
about
and
auditing.
but
to
dispose
of
that
case
in
the
manner,
it
seems
to
me,
reads
section
7609(f)
right
out
of
the
law.
if
the
service
is
free
to
audit
the
record
keeper
whenever
it
wants
to,
and
if
the
john
doe
summons
rules
never
apply
when
the
record
keeper
is
under
audit,
then
at
the
option
of
the
service,
john
doe
summons
rules
never--
mr.
michael
d.
savage
--banks
are
covered
by
section
7609(a).
they
are
a
designated
record
keeper.
and
the
irs
is
free
to
have
the
information
under
section
7609(f),
under
section
7609(a),
but
they
have
to
notify
the
record
keeper...
the
taxpayer...
that
they
are
seeking
the
information.
now,
the
government
argued
in
its
brief
that
when
the
record
keeper
is
under
audit,
there
is
no
need
for
the
john
doe
summons
rules
to
apply;
that
in
the
course
of
a
normal
enforcement
proceedings,
the
courts
will
be
able
to
scrutinize
these
summonses,
just
as
they
would
have
in
the
ex
parte
proceeding
under
section
7609(h).
but
that
argument
presupposes
that
there
will
be
normal
enforcement
proceeding.
it
presupposes
that
somebody
like
tiffany
has
interest
in
defending
its
clients'
identities.
tiffany's
interest
is
solely
in
its
own
tax
liability
for
tax
purposes.
tiffany's
interest
is
solely
in
its
own
tax
liability,
which
has
no
bearing
on--
mr.
michael
d.
savage
--for
example,
to
take
the
case
of
tiffany,
agent
lewis
said
that
he
wanted
to
review
the
underlying
license
agreement.
well,
we
would
have
given
agent
lewis
the
underlying
license
agreements.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
well,
the
addresses
and
the
social
security
numbers
of
the
licensees
deleted.
i
don't
know
that
the
irs
can
do
a
lot
just
with
names.
we
wouldn't
be
concerned
about
giving
names,
but
we
would
have
deleted
the
addresses
and
the
social
security
numbers.
now--
mr.
michael
d.
savage
--it
shouldn't...
i
have
to
concede,
your
honor,
that
that
problem
may
arise
in
a
very
limited
number
of
cases.
if
it
does,
i
think
it's
because
that's
what
congress
has
said.
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
you
that
it
shouldn't
arise
in
a
very
large
number
of
cases.
we
are
only
concerned
with
summonses...
with
cases
in
which
tiffany
has
been
able
to
demonstrate
that
a
purpose
of
the
summons
was
to
audit
its
customers.
if
tiffany
is
able
to
make
that
demonstration,
then
presumably
the
service
has
some
reason
for
wanting
to
audit
these
people.
if
it
has
reasons
for
wanting
to
audit
people,
then
it
ought
to
be
able
to
to
into
court
and
get
its
john
doe
summons.
in
cases
where
the
government
isn't
interested
in
auditing
these
people,
tiffany
shouldn't
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
a
purpose
of
the
summons
is
to
audit
them.
and
if
it
can't
demonstrate
that
under
the
interpretation
we're
asking
for,
if
tiffany
can't
demonstrate
that
a
purpose
of
the
audit
is
to
audit
its
customers,
then
the
government
is
free
to
have
the
customers'
identities
without
going
through
the
john
doe
procedures.
so,
theoretically,
either
way,
if
the
government
is
doing
its
job
right,
either
way
the
government
gets
what
it
wants
in
the
end.
it's
just
a
question
of
which
procedure
it
has
to
follow.
now,
there
may
be
some
cases
that
fall
through
the
cracks
of
the
theory.
but
we're
not
arguing
that
that's
the
way
it
should
be;
we're
arguing
that
that's
what
congress
has
said
in
the
statute.
getting
back
to
the
government's
argument
that
the
john
doe
procedures
don't
have
to
apply
when
the
record
keeper
is
under
audit.
i
just
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
tiffany
really
doesn't
have
any
interest
in
defending
the
identities
of
its
clients.
and
tiffany
doesn't
have
any
particular
objection
to
being
audited.
but
for
the
presence
of
the
john
doe
issue
in
this
case,
there
wouldn't
have
been
an
enforcement
proceeding.
and
it
would
be
a
mistake,
i
think,
to
assume
that
most
record
keepers
will
go
through
what
tiffany
has
gone
through
in
this
case
just
to
protect
the
identities
of
its
clients.
so
if
the
record
keeper
won't
bring
these
summonses
before
the
court,
and
if
the
john
doe
summons
procedures
don't
apply,
then
summonses
like
these
will
never
be
subjected
to
the
limited
court
scrutiny
that
congress
obviously
wanted
when
it
wrote
section
7609(f).
now,
the
rule,
the
interpretation
of
section
7605(f)
that
we
are
urging
on
the
court,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
court
should
rule
that
the
irs
must
comply
with
the
john
doe
summons
procedures
whenever
it
seeks
identities
of
customers
of
a
record
keeper
who
is
under
audit.
the
rule
we
are
urging
is
that
when
the
overt
acts
of
the
agent
and
the
published
institutional
posture
of
the
internal
revenue
service
demonstrate
that
a
purpose
of
the
summons
is
to
investigate
the
customers,
then
the
john
doe
procedures
must
be
complied
with
before
the
summons
can
be
enforced.
the
interpretation
essentially
is
the
rule
set
down
in
the
thompson
case
in
the
sixth
circuit.
and
it's
a
good
rule
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
it
squares
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
asks,
was
this
summons
issued
with
respect
to
the
tax
liability
of
someone
who
is
not
identified
in
the
summons?
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
then
the
john
doe
rule
applies.
second,
it
gives
vitality
to
the
statute.
it
recognizes
that
the
service
does
have
the
power
to
sidestep
the
john
doe
summons
rules.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
i
presume
the
government
would
concede
that;
yes.
i
don't
see
how
it
couldn't
concede
that.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
that
would
not
really
be
a
summons
issued
with
respect
to
the
tax
liability
of
tiffany.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
that
would
be...
well,
except
to
the
extent
that
tiffany--
mr.
michael
d.
savage
--might
be
subject
to
it.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
certainly,
the
government,
no
doubt,
would
find
it
useful
to
have
the
identities
of
the
clients
in
order
to...
perhaps,
in
order
to
verify
the
correctness
of
the
tax
liability
of
tiffany.
i've
been
through
a
lot
of
audits.
i've
never
once
seen
the
government
go
to
a
customer
and
say,
well,
did
you
really
pay
this
person
so
much
money,
or
did
you
really
receive
so
much
money?
the
government
usually
goes
after...
the
government
usually
inquires,
makes
inquiries
of
the
taxpayer's
customers
when
it
suspects
under-reporting.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
even
when
it
knows
who
they
are,
in
my
experience...
in
my
experience,
they
verify
the
income
based
on
the
records
they
have
before
them
when
they
have
to
reconstruct
income,
for
example,
or
when
they
think
that
there's
fraud
involved
and
they
need
witnesses.
then
they
start
to
inquire,
make
inquiries
of
the
taxpayer's
customers.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
if
they
know
who
they
are.
and
in
a
case
in
which
the
government
had
gone
in
and
had
merely
started
to
audit
the
record
keeper
and
hadn't
showed
any
intention
or
any
interest
in
its
customers,
then
they're
entitled
to
find
out
who
they
are
without
going
through
the
john
doe
procedures.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
don't
really
care
if
there's
a
dual
purpose.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
that's
correct.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
i
don't...
we
didn't
intend
to
raise
the
issue.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
we
might
have
said,
we
argued
below
that
the
government
didn't
really
need
this
information
to
complete
its
audit
of
tiffany,
but
we
didn't
challenge
the
relevancy.
we
can't
challenge
the
relevancy
of
what
the
customers'
identifications...
or
of
the
licensing
agreements
which
contain
the
customers'
identifications.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
the
one,
two,
and
three
goes
to
what
the
court
was...
goes
to
what
the
irs
has
to
demonstrate
to
the
court.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
i
think
if
you
read
the
statute
that
way,
there
is
not
much--
mr.
michael
d.
savage
--which
says
that
the
summons
relates
to
the
investigation.
the
irs
has
to
establish,
in
order
to
get
its
john
doe
summons,
assuming
it
has
served
a
summons
which
doesn't
identify
the
person
with
respect
to
whose
tax
liability
it
was
issued.
we're
not
even
into
a
john
doe
proceeding
if
we
haven't
gotten
that
far.
so
if
section
7609(f)
read
a
"person
or
persons",
then
i
would
argue,
first,
okay
this
summons
was
served
on
tiffany
fine
arts.
that
identified
tiffany.
give
us
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
we'll
also
show
that
it
was
issued
not
only
with
respect
to
tiffany's
tax
liability,
but
with
respect
to
the
tax
liabilities
of
its
clients.
didn't
identify
the
clients.
so
far,
i'm
past
the
introductory
language.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
now
the
irs
is
coming
into--
mr.
michael
d.
savage
--ah
ha,
but
then
you
look
at
paragraph
3
which
says
that
the
information
sought
to
be
obtained
from
the
examination
of
the
records
is
not
readily
available
from
other
sources.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
and
the
identify
of
the
person
or
persons
with
respect
to
whose
liability
the
summons
is
issued
is
not
readily
available.
the
three
paragraphs,
the
three
numbered
paragraphs
can't
be
referring
to
tiffany
once
you're
into
the
john
doe
summons
procedure;
by
definition,
we
are
in
the
john
doe
summons
procedure
because
we
can't
identify
the
people
who
we
want
to
get
information
on.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
relates
to
the
investigation
of
tiffany.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
if
the
statute
could
be
read
that
way,
and
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
purpose
for
the
statute
at
all,
obviously.
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
d.
savage
no.
there
are
cases
of
that
kind,
and
the
statute
clearly
does
apply
in
cases
of
that
kind.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
--or,
not
knowing
who
that
person
was,
to
have
the
court
take
a
look
at
the
summons.
sure.
that
is
one
thing,
that
is
one
reason
why
congress
wrote
section
7609(f).
i
don't
know
that
it
realized,
i
don't
know
that
it
was
aware
at
the
time
that
it
wrote
section
7609(f)
that
there
would
be
dual
purpose
summonses.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
were
no
dual
purpose
summonses
back
then.
this
a
fairly
new
invention.
the
question...
i
think
what
congress
wanted
to
do
when
it
wrote
section
7609(f)
was
to
prevent,
or
was
to
cause
court
scrutiny
of
investigations
of
unknown
taxpayers.
mr.
michael
d.
savage
i
was
just
going
to
finish
answering
the
question.
thank
you.
