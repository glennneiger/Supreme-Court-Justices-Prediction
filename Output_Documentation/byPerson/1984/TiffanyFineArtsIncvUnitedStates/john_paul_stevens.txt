justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
i'm
not
sure
you
aren't
suggesting
it
should
read
identify
not
just
person
or
persons,
but
i
think
all
of
the
persons
is
really
the
meaning
you
would
read
into
it,
i
think,
that
proves
identity...
i
mean
the
summons
issued.
and
if
you
do
that,
and
then
you
go
over
to
subparagraph
2,
which
says
there
must
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
such
person
or
a
group
of
persons...
there
may
be
a
tax
deficiency
of
some
kind.
how
could
they
ever
get
the
names
of
the
people
on
your
list
if
they
don't
have
any
specific
knowledge
about,
say,
a
particular
john
doe?
and
they
don't
know
who
he
is,
so
they
really
can't
say
whether
there's
any
tax
deficiency.
how
would
they
get
it?
justice
stevens
well,
of
course,
under
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
they
don't
have
any
trouble.
i
understand
that.
but
under
your
reading
of
the
statue,
how
would
they
get
it?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that
under
the
court
of
appeals
interpretation
of
the
statute,
they
will
get
these
names
if
it's
a
secondary
purpose.
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
could
they
ever
get
the
names
of
people
that
they
just
have
kind
of
a
hunch
that
maybe
these
franchisees,
or
whatever
they
are,
ought
to
be
looked
at
or
ought
to
be
audited,
without
first
having
some
basis
for
believing
there
was
a
deficiency
of
some
kind.
justice
stevens
but,
presumably,
if
they
get
the
names,
they
would
then
go
to
those
people
and
take...
examine
their
returns
and
see
if
there
is
any
reason
for
going
further.
but
you
say
they
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
do
that.
justice
stevens
well,
is
that
quite
right?
isn't
one
of
the
problems
the
statute
deals
with
is
subpoenas
on
banks?
and
they
don't
have
to
audit
them.
of
course,
there
they
would
have
to
follow
the
procedure,
of
course,
if
a
subpoena--
justice
stevens
excuse
me
for
going
back
to
the
statutory
language
again,
but
i
keep
rereading
this
darn
statute,
and
i
just
confess
that
even
if
you
read
it
your
way
and
say
the
person
or
persons,
and
assume
there's
a
bunch
of
unidentified
persons,
and
then
you
go
around
the
one,
two,
and
three,
it
still
does
relate
to
the
investigation
of
a
particular
person,
namely,
your
client,
and
there
is
reason
perhaps
for
believing
that
person
hasn't
paid
all
his
taxes
and
the
information
contained
with
him
would
relate
to
his
liability.
so
even
if
you
read
the
introductory
portion
of
the
statute
your
way,
they
would
do
that
in
court,
but
it
would
have
been
perfunctory,
because
all
they
would
have
had
to
have
shown
in
court
was
that
tiffany
was
suspect...
was
under
audit.
and
then
the
subpoena
would
have
been
enforceable,
if
i
read
the
one,
two,
and
three
correctly.
justice
stevens
in
court.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
as
long
as
you
read
"person"
to
mean
"person
or
persons",
one
of
those
persons
would
have
been
tiffany
in
any
event,
and
the
showing
necessary
to
get
enforcement
of
the
subpoena
would
merely
have
required
them
to
show
that
tiffany
was
under
audit.
so
it
would
have,
in
the
most
perfunctory
kind
of
proceeding.
justice
stevens
that's
what
it
says.
they've
got
to
show
the
summons
relates
to
the
investigation
of
a
particular
person
or
ascertainable
group.
at
least
it
relates
to
tiffany.
and
there's
a
reasonable
belief
for
believing
that
such
person,
tiffany,
is...
you
know,
is
the...
and
so
forth.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
as
long
as...
even
reading
the
introductory
portion
your
way,
i
don't
see
that...
you
could
require
a
court
proceeding,
i
agree,
but--
--but
what
if
the
irs
say
to
tiffany,
give
us
the
names
of
your
customers,
and
tiffany
says
why?
will
it
help
you
with
auditing
us?
and
the
irs
says
no,
but
we
just
want
them,
because
we
want
to
maybe
investigate
them.
then
paragraph
1
isn't
satisfied.
the
summons
relates
to
the
investigation
because
the
irs
says...
and
says
no,
this
summons
doesn't
relate
the
investigation
of
tiffany
at
all.
and
i
asked
you
a
minute
ago...
you
said
that
even
if
that
happens,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
would
say
you
don't
have
to
follow
the
john
doe
proceedings.
if
you
don't
read
it
that
way,
i
would
think
justice
stevens
is
certainly
right.
so
what
about
paragraph
1
on
page
4?
justice
stevens
right.
and
you're
in
court
now.
justice
stevens
and
they
say
our
summons
is...
we
want
to
investigate
the
tax
liability
of
(a)
tiffany,
whom
we
know;
and
(b)
mr.
x,
whom
we
do
not
know.
justice
stevens
the
information
sought
to
be
obtained
is
available.
justice
stevens
there
would
be
if
they
weren't
investigating
tiffany's
tax
liability.
then
the
statute
would
apply
right
on
the
nose.
if
they
conceded
that
tiffany
paid
all
their
taxes
every
year,
but
they
still
want
to
look
at
their
customers'
liability,
then
the
statute
would
apply.
and
there
must
be
a
lot
of
cases
of
that
kind.
you
don't
audit
every
record
keeper
whose
records
you
want
to
look
at,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
wallace,
before
you
get
too
far
into
your
argument.
i
must
confess
i've
been
a
little
troubled
by
the
affidavit
that
both
briefs
quote,
in
which
the
agent
says
one
purpose
of
the
audit
was
to
check
out
tiffany.
it
seems
to
me
it's
almost
the
equivalent
of
saying
that
the
investigation
has
at
least
two
purposes,
one
of
which
was
to
investigate
tiffany,
and
the
other
of
which
was
to
investigate
the
tax
liability
of
certain
unidentified
persons.
and
if
the
subpoena,
on
its
own
face,
had
said
the
purpose
of
this
subpoena
is
twofold...
to
investigate
and
tiffany
and
also
to
investigate
another
group
of
unidentified
people
whose
names
we
don't
know...
and
they
said
that
in
so
many
words,
so
that
you
would
know
that
you
could
read
the
statute
as
to
them
the
way
your
opponent
does,
would
the
statute
then
have
applied?
would
that
change
the
case
any?
justice
stevens
well...
but
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
complete
answer,
because
congress
has
said
that
when
you're
going
after
identified
taxpayers,
you
want
to
follow
a
little
different
procedure,
maybe
not--
justice
stevens
--may
i
interrupt
you
again,
mr.
wallace,
with...
supposing
one
paragraph
of
the
subpoena
plainly
did
not
relate
to
tiffany's
liability,
but
somehow
said
also
the
name
of
the
customer
who
bought
a
million
dollar
island
in
jamaica
or
something,
if
you
had
some
descriptor
plainly
seeking
that
person.
would
you
agree
that
if
there
was
a
severable
part,
that
should
be
treated
as
a
separate
subpoena
for
which
79...
the
separate
procedure
would
apply?
