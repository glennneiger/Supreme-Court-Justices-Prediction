justice
o'connor
mr.
savage,
does
7609(f),
the
john
doe
summons
procedure,
apply
only
to
summons
to
the
people
who
are
third
party
record
keepers,
as
defined
in
7609(a)?
justice
o'connor
--mr.
savage,
if
you
were
correct
on
your

be
able
to
follow
up
adequately
on
the
liability
of,
for
example,
tiffany
itself,
under
your
view.
justice
o'connor
mr.
savage,
tiffany
raised
the
issue
of
relevance
below,
did
it
not?
whether
this
information
was
relevant
to
the
audit
of
tiffany?
justice
o'connor
i
see.
justice
o'connor
so
the
names,
the
bare
names,
as
opposed
to
the
transactions
or

or

be
relevant?
is
