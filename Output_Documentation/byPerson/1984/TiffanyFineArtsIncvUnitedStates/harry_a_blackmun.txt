justice
blackmun
mr.
savage,
is
it
not
for
us
to
determine
what
the
purpose
was?
it
seems
to
me
that
you
and
the
government
are
at
odds
on
that
one.
how
are
we
going
to
determine
that?
justice
blackmun
you
are
willing,
i
understand,
to
give
the
service
everything
it
wants
except
the
identification
of
your
clients.
