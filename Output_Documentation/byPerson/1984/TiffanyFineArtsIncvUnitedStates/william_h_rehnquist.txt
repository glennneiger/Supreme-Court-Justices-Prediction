justice
rehnquist
wasn't
that
really
what
congress
was
concerned
in,
in
passing
the
statute?
the
situation
like
california
bankers
association
v.
schultz
where
the
bank
is
subpoenaed
to
produce
records
of
ab,
a
depositor.
the
bank
says,
sure,
take
a
look.
they
don't
have
any
real
motive
to
protest.
this
was
to
give
someone
with
an
adverse
interest
a
right
to
participate.
