justice
stevens
mr.
levy,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
did
the
ninth
circuit
cite
the
dunn
case?
justice
stevens
i
see;
because
in
the
first
opinion,
they
merely
said
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
these
convictions.
justice
stevens
well,
did
they
find
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
theory,
or
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
conviction?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
though,
directing
your
attention
to
this
paragraph,
i
suppose
one
can
argue
that
there
were
alternative
grounds,
alternative
holdings
in
dunn,
and
that
if
justice
holmes
really
intended
to
rely
on
the
res
judicata
analysis,
which
justice
butler
disagreed
with
violently,
that
the
statement
about
inconsistent
verdicts
is
really
what
is
dicta.
justice
stevens
well,
it
would
stand
up,
wouldn't
it,
if
he
was
right,
that
one
of
those
would
not
be...
would
not
bar
the
other
and
the
facts
of
that
particular
case?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
he
wouldn't
have
needed
to
make
the
inconsistent
verdict
point
at
all.
justice
stevens
yes,
assuming
they
are
inconsistent.
justice
stevens
how
often
has
this
court
actually
rested
a
decision
on
the
second
point
of
the
dunn
case?
justice
stevens
no,
the
inconsistent
verdict
point,
which
was
the
last
point
of
the
opinion.
