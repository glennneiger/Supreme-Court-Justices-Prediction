justice
marshall
was
the
jury
properly
instructed,
in
your
mind?
justice
marshall
counsel,
if
the
jury,
after
listening
to
the
judge's
instruction,
is
of
the
opinion
that
these
are
two
different
crimes,
one
involving
cocaine,
and
one
cocaine
and
qualudes,
they
are
different
crimes.
and
we
can
find
guilty
of
one
and
not
guilty
of
the
other.
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
marshall
mine
is...
i
asked
you
if,
under
the
judge's
instruction,
the
jury
was
of
the
opinion
that
these
were
two
separate
crimes,
wouldn't
it
be
all
right?
justice
marshall
you
just
said
so;
that
the
judge...
that
was
the
judge's
instruction.
