rehnquist
how
did
those
circuits
try
to
distinguish
dunn,
mr.
levy?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
court
has
never
held
that
res
judicata
can
be
used
in
a
criminal
case
to
attack
verdicts
on
counts
rendered
at
the
same
time
and
submitted
to
the
jury
at
the
same
time.
justice
rehnquist
ex
parte
bain
is
virtually
dead,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
always
to
distinguish
it;
never
to
follow
it.
justice
rehnquist
but
how
does
that
affect
the
dunn
issue?
it
doesn't,
i
take
it.
justice
rehnquist
but
how
does
it
affect
the
dunn
issue?
justice
rehnquist
but,
counsel,
the
same...
did
the
same
counsel
argue
on
appeal
as
tried
the
case?
justice
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
against
you
on
this
point,
didn't
they?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
why
are
you
addressing
it
here?
justice
rehnquist
so
you're
just
kind
of
running
through
a
whole
string
of
things.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
think
what
you're
submitting
now
wouldn't
support
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
several
counts
and
reversed
several.
and
what
you're
saying
is
the
whole
thing
should
be
washed
out.
