mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
since
the
time
of
this
court's
decision
in
dunn
v.
united
states,
more
than
50
years
ago,
the
rule
has
been
settled
in
the
federal
system
that
inconsistency
in
a
jury's
verdict
is
not
a
ground
to
set
aside
an
otherwise
valid
conviction.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
validity
of
an
exception
to
the
dunn
rule,
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit
below,
for
the
offense
under
21
u.s.c.
section
843
(b),
of
using
a
telephone
to
facilitate
a
drug
felony.
the
relevant
facts
are
undisputed
and
may
be
briefly
summarized.
respondent
was
charged
in
15
counts
with
offenses
rising
out
an
extensive
drug
distribution
operation.
it
was
agreed
by
all
in
proceedings
below,
the
respondent's
husband
and
son
were
the
principal
operators,
and
the
respondent
was
a
relatively
more
minor
participant.
insofar
as
pertinent
here,
respondent
was
charged
in
one
count
with
conspiring
to
possess
cocaine
with
intent
to
distribute
it,
and
in
three
counts,
with
using
the
telephone
to
facilitate
the
cocaine
conspiracy.
the
jury
convicted
respondent
on
the
three
telephone
counts
and
acquitted
her
on
the
conspiracy
court.
on
respondent's
appeal,
the
ninth
circuit
set
aside
the
three
telephone
convictions
on
the
ground
of
inconsistency
in
the
verdict.
the
court
concluded
that
because
the
jury
had
acquitted
respondent
on
the
conspiracy
charge
that
was
the
offense
alleged
to
have
been
facilitated
by
the
use
of
the
telephone,
the
telephone
counts
could
not
stand.
the
court
recognized
the
dunn
rule.
the
inconsistency
in
a
jury's
verdict
is
not
a
ground
to
reverse
its
convictions;
but
it
held
that
an
exception
to
dunn
exists
for
the
telephone
facilitation
offense
under
section
843(b).
we
submit
that
this
was
error.
our
position,
in
brief,
is
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
dunn
and
that
the
decision
below
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
both
the
exact
holding
and
the
fundamental
rationale
of
dunn.
dunn
and
its
progeny,
to
which
this
court
has
consistently
adhered
over
the
last
half
century,
recognized
several
basic
principles:
first,
the
dunn
rule
recognizes
that
a
jury,
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
of
lenity
can
acquit
a
defendant,
even
though
it
is
entirely
convinced
of
his
guilt
under
the
law
and
the
evidence.
dunn
thus
makes
clear
that
in
the
context
of
inconsistent
verdicts,
an
acquittal
is
not
to
be
deemed
a
determination
by
the
jury
that
it
found
the
government's
evidence
inadequate
to
establish
the
defendant's
guilt.
because
of
the
jury's
power
of
lenity,
dunn
establishes
that
an
inconsistency
in
the
verdict
does
not
undermine
or
impeach
the
otherwise
valid
convictions
that
the
jury
returns.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
did
not
cite
the
dunn
case
in
its
original
decision.
the
government
sought
rehearing,
and
the
court
in
denying
our
petition
for
rehearing,
issued
a
supplemental
opinion.
and
in
that
opinion,
it
cited
to
and
purported
to
distinguish
or
find
an
exception
to
the
dunn
decision.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct,
and
that
was
said
in
response
to
the
government's
argument
that
the
verdicts
were
not,
in
fact,
inconsistent
because
the
jury
could
have
found
the
respondent
used
the
telephone
to
facilitate
some
offense
other
than
the
conspiracy
of
which
she
was
acquitted.
we
have
not
raised,
separately
raised
that
issue
for
review
in
this
court,
but
we
did
contend
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
inconsistency
on
the
facts,
and
the
court
rejected
that
because
it
found
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that
theory.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no.
our
reading
of
the
opinion,
i
think,
makes
it
quite
clear
that
they
found
no
evidence
in
the
initial
opinion
to
support
the
government's
contention
that
the
verdicts
were
not,
in
fact,
inconsistent.
now,
the
dunn
rule
also
recognizes,
in
accordance
with
generally
established
principles,
that
convictions
are
not
to
be
upset
by
speculation
or
inquiry
into
the
jury
process
for
the
actual
reasons
for
the
jury's
inconsistency.
in
this
way,
dunn
protects
the
integrity
of
the
jury
verdict
and
ensures
that
an
acquittal
based
on
leniency
is
not
later
invoked
to
overturn
the
very
conviction
that
the
jury
determined
to
be
appropriate.
in
other
words,
dunn
prevents
a
defendant
from
isolating
the
portion
of
the
verdict
favorable
to
him
and
using
it
to
challenge
the
remaining
and
unfavorable
portion
that
was
simultaneously
reached
by
the
very
same
jury.
no
one
in
this
case,
neither
respondent
nor
the
ninth
circuit
below,
takes
issue
with
the
general
validity
of
the
dunn
rule.
however,
it
is
contended
that
an
exception
to
dunn
should
be
made
here.
in
arguing
for
such
an
exception,
respondent
emphasizes
the
compound
predicate
nature
of
the
telephone
charges
on
which
he
was
convicted;
that
is,
the
telephone
convictions,
which
are
the
compound
offense,
rests
on
the
use
of
the
telephone
to
facilitate
another,
or
predicate,
offense.
this
factor
provides
no
basis
to
depart
from
dunn.
first,
the
jury
lenity
rationale
of
dunn
is
just
as
applicable
in
cases
of
compound
predicate
offenses
as
in
any
other
case.
indeed,
in
this
case,
for
example,
respondent,
who
concededly
was
a
more
minor
participant
in
the
drug
operation,
could
well
have
been
acquitted
on
the
conspiracy
count
because
the
jury
concluded
that
that
charge,
although
supported
by
the
evidence,
was
disproportionate
to
respondent's
involvement
and
culpability.
and
the
convictions,
based
on
the
telephone
calls
in
which
she
personally
participated,
were
both
adequate
and
more
appropriate.
in
addition,
dunn
itself
involved
inconsistent
verdicts
on
compound
predicate
offenses.
there,
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
maintaining
a
nuisance
which
required
the
jury
to
find
as
one
of
the
elements,
that
liquor
was
unlawfully
kept
for
sale.
however,
the
jury
acquitted
the
defendant
on
the
possession
and
sale
counts
that
served
as
the
predicate
for
the
nuisance
charge.
on
this
record,
and
over
a
lengthy
dissent
that
stressed
the
interrelation
of
the
offenses,
the
court
affirmed
the
nuisance
conviction
and
held
that
consistency
in
the
verdicts
is
not
necessary.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct,
as
this
court
noted
in
harris
v.
rivera.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
not
at
all.
we're
only
saying
that
the
court
was
well
aware
of
the
interrelation
of
the
offenses
in
reaching
its
holding
in
dunn
that
consistency
was
not
necessary.
since
those
offenses
were,
in
fact,
compound
and
predicate
offenses,
very
similar
to
what
we
have
here,
we
think
that
the
precise
holding
in
dunn
controls
this
case.
and
dunn
directly
forecloses
an
exception
to
the
inconsistent
verdict
rule
for
compound
predicate
offenses.
now,
beyond
the
applicability
of
the
jury
lenity
rationale
here
and
the
precise
holding
in
dunn
itself,
there
is
simply
no
analytical
basis
for
carving
out
an
exception
to
the
dunn
rule
for
compound
predicate
offenses.
two
closely
related
theories
have
been
suggested;
first,
that
the
inconsistency
renders
the
evidence
insufficient
to
prove
the
compound
offense;
and
second,
that
the
inconsistency
estops
or
precludes
the
government
from
establishing
the
compound
offense.
neither
of
these
theories
is
persuasive.
let
me
discuss,
first,
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
under
this
theory,
which
is
advanced
both
by
respondent
and
by
the
ninth
circuit
below,
the
argument
is
that
a
jury's
acquittal
means
that
it
rejected
the
government's
evidence
and
found
that
the
defendant
did
not
commit
the
predicate
offense.
and,
therefore,
the
government's
proof
of
a
compound
offense
is
necessarily
insufficient,
because
it
fails
to
establish
the
required
predicate
element.
this
argument
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
dunn,
which
specifically
recognizes
that
an
acquittal
does
not
establish
the
defendant's
innocence,
but
instead
should
reflect
the
jury's
exercise
of
its
power
lenity,
even
though
it
believed
that
the
defendant,
in
fact,
was
guilty.
moreover,
nothing
in
this
argument
limited
the
compound
and
predicate
offenses.
rather,
the
proof
supporting
the
convictions
will
always
be
inadequate
if,
as
respondent
urges,
one
disregards
or
subtracts
from
the
record
the
evidence
that
a
court
believes
the
jury
did
not
accept,
as
shown
by
its
acquittal.
if
this
were
not
so,
the
verdicts
would
not
have
been
inconsistent
in
the
first
place.
indeed,
under
this
theory,
dunn
itself
was
incorrectly
decided,
because
the
nuisance
conviction
in
that
case
could
not
be
supported
without
the
evidence
relating
to
the
possession
and
sale
counts
on
which
the
defendant
was
acquitted.
thus,
contrary
to
respondent's
characterization,
this
case
involves
a
narrow
and
unique
exception
to
the
dunn
rule.
acceptance
of
our
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
argument
would
be
a
fundamental
repudiation
of
dunn.
now,
of
course,
entirely
irrespective
of
dunn,
the
evidence
must
be
sufficient
to
support
the
conviction.
but
respondent's
argument
confuses
the
quite
separate
issues
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
the
consistency
of
the
verdicts.
the
former
involves
the
evidentiary
record.
the
latter
involves
the
reliability
or
rationality
of
the
jury
process.
the
sufficiency
question
asks
whether
the
government
adduced
adequate
proof
under
traditional
standards
to
establish
every
element
of
the
offense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
as
the
jury
must
have
found
in
returning
its
convictions.
that
depends
upon
the
totality
of
the
proof
in
the
record
and
is
unaffected
by
the
other
counts
that
were
brought
or
the
jury's
disposition
of
those
counts.
respondent's
argument
is
unavailing
because
it
blurs
the
analytically
distinct
issues
of
sufficiency
and
consistency
and
is
simply
an
attempt
to
reformulate
in
the
guise
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
the
inconsistent
verdict
argument
that
was
rejected
in
dunn.
now,
the
other
and
closely-related
line
of
argument
for
an
exception
to
dunn,
which
is
advanced
primarily
in
the
third
and
eleventh
circuit
decision
cited
in
our
briefs,
is
that
the
jury's
acquittal
on
the
predicate
counts
estops
or
precludes
the
government
from
establishing
the
compound
offense.
this
argument,
too,
is
without
merit,
for
much
the
same
reasons.
first,
as
for
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
argument,
the
estoppel
argument
is
fundamentally
at
odds
with
dunn
and
the
recognition
of
the
jury's
power
of
lenity
to
acquit
against
the
evidence.
so,
too,
the
estoppel
exception
is
not
really
an
exception
at
all,
though
it
would
essentially
eviscerate
the
dunn
rule.
nothing
in
the
estoppel
argument
limits
at
the
compound
and
predicate
offenses.
rather,
this--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--those
circuits
relied
on
a
passage
in
dunn
that
discussed
res
judicata.
the
court,
in
justice
holmes's
opinion,
said
that
if...
analogized
the
separate
counts
in
an
indictment
to
separate
indictments
tried
successively.
the
court
said
that
if
the
counts
had
been
brought
in
successive
indictments,
there
would
have
been
no
res
judicata
problem,
and
therefore
it
followed
there
would
be
no
problem
with
the
inconsistent
verdicts
in
the
single
indictment.
as
we
demonstrate
in
our
brief,
that
res
judicata
discussion
was
of
doubtful
correctness
at
the
time,
for
the
court
had
previously
indicated
that
res
judicata
does
apply
to
criminal
cases.
but
in
any
event,
that
discussion
has
long
since
been
repudiated
by
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court,
such
as
sealfon
and
ashe
v.
swenson.
nevertheless,
the
dunn
rule
remains
of
continued
and
full
vitality,
based
on
rationale
of
jury
lenity.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
absolutely
not.
dunn
is
the
only
discussion
of
that
point.
to
the
contrary,
as
we
indicate,
dunn
was
neither
correct
at
the
time,
nor
is
it
sound
in
that
respect
now.
indeed,
the
general
law
of
estoppel
is
that
there
is
no
internal
or
single
case
estoppel.
it
has
never
been
thought
that
the
law
of
estoppel
applies
to
single
proceedings,
and
the
purpose
of
the
doctrine
of
estoppel,
to
prevent
needless
relitigation
and
promote
judicial
economy,
is
simply
inapplicable
to
a
joint
trial
of
different
counts.
in
addition,
it
would
be
wholly
unjustified
to
pick
out
one
part
of
an
inconsistent
verdict
and
use
that
to
override
another
part
that
was
simultaneously
returned
by
the
very
same
jury.
that
simply
doesn't
make
any
sense,
to
pick
and
choose
among
the
parts
of
the
verdict
and
give
priority
to
one
over
the
other.
so,
for
those
reasons,
we
don't
think
either
the
general
law
of
estoppel
or
the
res
judicata
discussion
in
dunn
itself
gives
any
support
to
the
estoppel
exception,
as
urged.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
suppose
that
is
always
the
case
when
there
are
alternative
grounds
for
decision.
but
the
fact
of
the...
the
basic
point
here
is
that
whatever
was
intended
at
the
time,
it
is
clear
that
the
res
judicata
discussion
simply
does
not
stand
up.
and
the
dunn
rule,
nevertheless,
has
continued
to
be
followed.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
it's
correct
that
successive
prosecutions
would
have
been
permissible--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--then
the
inconsistency
of
verdicts
seems
an
easier
case.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
wouldn't
have
needed
to,
although,
again,
it
could
have
been
an
entirely
independent
and
indeed
equally
mor
more
important
part
of
the
decision.
it's
hard
to
know
from
the
very
brief
opinion.
but
the
point
on
the
res
judicata
discussions,
we
think
it
was
not
correct
that
those
counts
could
have
been
brought
in
separate
prosecutions;
that
is,
if
the
defendant
had
first
been
charged
with
possession
and
sale
and
acquitted,
we
think
it
would
not
have
been
permissible
to
bring
a
second
prosecution
on
the
nuisance
charge,
assuming
that
the
verdicts
were,
in
fact,
inconsistent.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
right.
now,
the
government
had
argued
in
that
case,
as
we
did
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
that
in
fact
there
was
no
inconsistency.
and
we
think
that
was
a
substantial
argument
in
dunn,
as
it
is
here.
but
the
court's
opinion,
i
think,
does
make
it
quite
clear
in
dunn
that
it
did
not
rest
the
decision
on
that
narrow
ground
that
the
verdicts
were
not
inconsistent,
but
rather
assumed
for
purposes
of
decision
that
they
were
inconsistent,
and
went
on
to
decide
more
broadly
that
consistency
in
the
verdicts
simply
had
not--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
second
point
being
the
res
judicata
discussion?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
we
think
every
time
that
the
court
has
considered
the
inconsistent
verdict
issue
since
dunn,
it
has
relied
on
the
basic
point
that
inconsistency
in
the
verdicts
is
not
required,
and
it
has
never
cited
or
relied
on
the
res
judicata
discussion.
and
i
think
that
is
equally
true
in
the
lower
courts,
with
the
exception
of
these
decisions
under
843(b)
that
have
now
resurrected
the
discredit
res
judicata
analysis
and
used
that
as
a
basis
for
finding
an
exception
to
the
dunn
rule.
now,
the
estoppel
exception,
in
addition
to
all
the
other
problems,
simply
cannot
be
limited
to
compound
and
predicate
offenses.
this
theory,
if
it
were
accepted
by
the
court,
would
extend
far
beyond
the
present
context
and
would
subject
all
inconsistent
verdicts
to
the
usual
rules
of
preclusion
that
apply
in
separate
proceedings.
contrary
to
the
dunn
rule,
which
results
in
inconsistent
verdicts
being
upheld,
the
estoppel
theory
would
mean
that
inconsistent
verdicts
would
always
be
revised
because,
by
definition,
a
verdict
that
is
truly
inconsistent
cannot
meet
the
usual
standards
of
preclusion.
indeed,
under
modern
principles
of
collateral
estoppel,
as
i
just
discussed
with
justice
stevens,
the
inconsistent
verdicts
in
dunn
themselves
would
be
impermissible.
so,
again,
while
the
estoppel
argument,
like
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
argument,
is
presented
as
a
narrow
and
unique
exception
to
the
dunn
rule,
in
reality
it
constitutes
a
basic
rejection
of
the
rule
and
would
mean
that
dunn
itself
was
incorrectly
decided.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
shall
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.

levy
just
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
respondent's
argument
is
most
notable
for
its
avoidance
of
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
on
the
inconsistent
verdict
issue.
it
raises
a
number
of
questions...
variance
notice,
conflict
of
counsel...
and
we
agree
with
justice
rehnquist's
characterization
that
these
simply
are
not
appropriately
considered
here.
they
were
not
preserved
below.
they
are
not
alternative
grounds
for
affirming
the
decision,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
that
we
presented
in
our
petition.
now,
respondent
argued
at
some
length
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
we
think
that
this
case
is
not
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
case,
and
that
that
simply
confuses
the
issue.
the
respondent
did
not
raise
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
objection
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
a
traditional
review
of
the
evidentiary
record
to
determine
whether
the
proof
was
adequate
to
support
the
conviction.
that
simply
is
not
an
issue
that
was
ever
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
not
presented
here.
but,
beyond
that,
we
don't
see
how
there
could
be
any
real
doubt
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
this
record.
we
summarized
it
in
our
brief
so
that
the
court
would
understand
the
case
and
see
that
there
was
no
problem
with
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
respondent
engaged
in
several
telephone
calls.
she
knew
who
the
thin
man
was.
she
knew
his
telephone
number.
she
knew
what
was
meant
by
the
coded
reference
to
"coupons"
as
money.
reading
the
transcripts
of
the
wire
tap
records,
we
don't
think
there
can
be
any
serious
question
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
and
the
district
court,
at
the
sentencing
proceeding,
after
sitting
through
the
entirety
of
this
trial,
made
it
clear
that
he
thought
the
evidence
was
ample
and
that
the
jury
correctly
resolved
the
telephone
counts
against
the
respondent.
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
issue
that
respondent
seeks
to
present
would
be
no
different
if
the
conspiracy
charge
had
never
been
brought;
if
this
were
only
a
three
count
indictment
on
the
telephone
offenses,
alleging,
but
not
separately
charging,
that
a
conspiracy
was
facilitated
by
the
use
of
the
telephone.
on
that
record,
if
the
jury
convicted
on
all
three
telephone
counts,
there
would
be
no
inconsistency
in
the
verdict,
and
the
record
would
be
just
as
it
is
here.
and
in
that
circumstance,
we
don't
think
there
could
be
any
realistic
question
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
record
to
support
the
convictions.
the
issue
in
this
case,
which
respondent
has
refused
to
recognize,
is
whether
the
dunn
rule,
as
applied
and
reaffirmed
consistently
by
this
court
over
a
half
century
in
cases
like
dotterweich
and
hamling
and
standefer,
and
as
recently
as
a
few
years
ago,
in
harris
v.
rivera,
whether
the
inconsistent
verdict
rule
is
applicable
here,
as
we
contend,
or
whether
there
is
some
exception
for
the
offense
of
telephone
facilitation
under
section
843(b).
for
the
reasons
stated
today
and
in
our
briefs,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
such
exception;
that
is
case
is
controlled
by
the
dunn
rule;
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
