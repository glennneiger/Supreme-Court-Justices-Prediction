justice
white
i
don't
suppose...
do
you
think
the
government
would
be
here
if
it
was
clear
that
the
finding
was
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
of
anything?
justice
white
well,
that
isn't...
i'll
put
it
to
you:
what
if
it
were
clear
that
that
isn't
what
they
held;
that
they
held
that
just
because,
because
there
wasn't
a
conviction
on
one
count,
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
for
the
other?
justice
white
but
you
aren't
complaining
about
dunn;
is
that
it?
justice
white
and
when
you
say
that
you
could
never
convict
on
the
telephone
counts
if
there
is
an
acquittal
on
the
conspiracy
count.
justice
white
no
matter
what.
even
if
you
said
well,
we
certainly
would
have
sustained
a
jury
verdict,
there's
enough
evidence
to
sustain
the
jury
verdict
on
the
telephone
counts.
you
would
say
that
the
jury
just
cant'
come
out
inconsistent.
