mr.
john
j.
cleary
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
human
absolutes
tend
toward
arbitrariness.
the
government's
position,
succinctly
stated,
is
dunn
permits
no
exceptions.
in
the
example
of
a
person
charged
with
robbery
in
felony
murder
for
a
death
resulting
from
the
commission
of
that
robbery,
if
there
was
a
finding
of
not
guilty
on
the
robbery,
the
murder
conviction
could
stand.
and
the
essence
of
our
position,
as
articulated
by
the
circuit
courts
below,
was
that
843(b)
is
a
very
narrow
offense
which
has,
as
an
essential
element,
the
commission
of
a
felony
prescribed
in
title
xxi.
in
the
dunn
case
that
the
court
had
before
it
in
1932,
there
was
three
discrete
misdemeanors:
maintaining
a
nuisance,
a
building
where
liquor
was
kept
for
sale,
the
offense
of
possession,
and
the
offense
of
sale.
and
there
was
some
overlap,
admittedly,
but
we
all
know
that
possession
for
sale
is
an
offense
other
than
simply
possession
for
sale
itself,
and
that
some
of
the
language
was
not
necessary
in
the
government's
position,
which
was
even
referred
to
by
justice
holmes,
was
that
you
could
have
the
commission
of
one
without
the
other.
in
this
particular
case,
there
has
to
be
some
balance.
sealfon
was
the
opinion
that
indicated
that
there
has
to
be
some
consideration
given
to
an
acquittal.
admittedly,
in
sealfon
we
had
a
two-count
referred,
conspiracy
and
a
fraud.
the
conspiracy
went
to
trial
first;
an
acquittal,
and
there
was
res
judicata
after
the
second.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
i
did
not,
your
honor.
i
was
appointed
by
this
court
after
counsel
had
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
that
the
court
was
wrestling
with
the
dual
issue,
your
honor.
i
think,
first,
the
issue
was
the
hannah
doctrine,
which
was,
was
the
essential
element
there;
and
also
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case
which
indicate,
at
most,
some
type
of
attenuated
suspicion
focusing
on
betty
lou
powell.
i
think
that
what
has
to
be
understood
in
this
particular
case
is,
as
all
of
the
circuits
have
said
in
this
matter,
is
that
this
rule
applies
only
where
the
government
charges
a
targeted
conspiracy
or
offense;
that
843(b)
had
in
this
case
a
specific
conspiracy
that
included
as
overt
acts
each
of
the
four
telephone
counts.
and
where
it
has
targeted
those
offenses,
and
the
jury
then
decides,
the
same
jury,
the
same
case,
in
those
unique
circumstances,
that
which
is
the
essential
element
of
843(b),
when
it
goes
down...
whooph...
so
also
the
telephone
count.
four
circuits
have
ruled
on
the
issue.
seventeen
circuit
judges.
not
one
dissent.
each
and
every
one
of
them
recognized
that
this
could
not
be
in
extremis
applied
across
the
board.
there
are
some
limitations.
i
think
in
this
case,
there
also
is
a
duty
to
respect
the
action
of
the
jury.
and
this
court
is
told
that...
i
don't
think
this
is
a
court
that's
going
to
be
delving
into
the
facts...
that
the
jury
was
wrong.
it
was
lenity
that
acted
here.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
results
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
balances
respect
for
the
jury
and
the
court
along
that
particular
count--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
and
that
aggravated
the
situation,
which
indicated,
i
think,
the
reason
the
result
in
this
case.
the
circuit
judge
who
wrote
this
opinion
is
the
most
experienced
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and
in
tobbs
v.
florida,
this
court
laid
out
what
insufficient
evidence
is,
or
going
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
insufficient
evidence
is
words
of
art
to
an
experienced
appellate
jurist.
in
this
case,
he
said
the
facts
aren't
there
in
the
original
opinion,
the
evidence
isn't
there,
and
when
the
government
said
we
want
a
second
shot
on
a
petition
for
rehearing,
he
said,
"let
me
make
this
clear
for
you.
"
"you
lack
sufficient
evidence.
"
"insufficient
evidence.
"
now,
those
are
not
sloppy
craftsmanship,
an
error.
and
the
government
says
we
have
an
inconsistency
case.
a
condition
precedent
to
your
review
for
inconsistency
is
that
you
must
find
the
evidence
sufficient.
and
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
your
cases
on
inconsistent
verdicts,
starting
with
dunn,
dotterweich,
standefer,
and
harris
v.
riveria,
each
one
of
those
cases,
there
was
an
express
finding
in
the
holdings
of
this
court
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient.
i
find
that
due
deference
is
owed
to
the
lower
court
in
the
evaluation
of
fact.
and,
further,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
went
an
extra
step,
giving
the
government
a
little
extra.
and
what
they
want
to
give
them
in
the
case...
we'll
apply
the
areas
variation.
the
fifth
circuit
says
if
you
have
a
situation
where
there
is
evidence
outside
of
the
targeted
conspiracy,
some
other
conspiracy,
no
matter
how
ephemeral
it
might
be,
we'll
sustain
the
conviction.
they
said
we're
looking
under
the
areas
doctrine;
we
can't
find
that
evidence.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
can't
predict
what
the
government
would
do,
and
i
would
not
want
to--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
would
hope
that
the
government
would
not
come
to
this
court.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that,
one,
dunn
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
position
of
the
ninth
circuit,
even
under
the
inconsistent
doctrine;
that
843(b),
when
it
has
a
charge,
specified
conspiracy,
is
an
exception
to
dunn,--
and
so
to
the
extent...
i
think
dunn
is
valid
law
as
to
what
it
said,
and
again
the
precedent
of
this
court
is
rather
substantial.
i'm
saying
that
there
is
a
very
narrow
limited
exception
as
defined
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
government
says
no.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
on
the
charged
conspiracy;
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
juries
are
inconsistent,
this
court
well
knows.
in
this
case,
there
was
four
telephone
counts.
found
not
guilt
of
one,
but
guilty
of
three.
if
the
predicate
offenses
was
established
by
the
other
evidence,
i
couldn't
say
they
cut
loose
on
one
telephone
count;
therefore,
the
other
three
can't
stand.
i
can't
take
that
position.
it's
illogical.
so
i
say
inconsistency
is
there,
and
i
have
to
respect
the
authorities
of
this
court,
but
i
just
don't
think
there's
an
absolute
dunn
requirement
that
would
out
across
the
board
for
all
cases.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
jury
was
not
irrational,
as
justice
marshal
alluded
to,
and
i
think
that
the
point
here
was
they
followed,
like
soldiers
almost,
the
law
of
this
case.
they
took
the
trial
judge's
instruction.
and
the
judge
instructed
on
what
we
consider
the
fatal
variance
aspect
in
this
particular
case,
where
the
charges
were
for
cocaine.
and
the
jury
came
out
with
its
first
note
and
says,
now,
we
don't
know
if
it's
cocaine
or
not,
and
if
we
can't
find
cocaine,
do
we
have
to
go
that
way?
and
the
judge
instructed,
on
the
two
conspiracy
counts
and
on
the
two
substantive
counts,
if...
for
you
to
find
guilty,
there
must
be
that
specified
controlled
substance,
cocaine
or
qualudes.
the
came
back
the
second
time
and
said
we're
having
problems.
does
this
mean...
we're
at
an
impasse.
if
we
have
to
find
it's
cocaine,
as
charged
and
we
can't,
do
we
have
to
find
not
guilty?
and
the
response
was
the
judgment,
and
the
prosecutor
realized
that
the
case
might
be
going
down
and
said,
well,
i'll
stick
with
my
stare
decisis.
i'm
stuck
with
the
specific
substance
as
to
the
conspiracy
in
the
substantive
counts,
but
on
the
telephone
counts,
judge,
make
it
cocaine
or
qualudes.
but
what
did
the
indict
charge
in
the
telephone
count?
it
charged
a
conspiracy
to
possess
cocaine
with
intent
to
distribute,
or
possession
of
cocaine
with
intent
to
distribute.
cocaine,
not
qualudes.
this
court,
in
stirone,
said
you
can't
get
away
with
that
type
of
thing.
in
our
system
of
justice,
its'
the
indictment
returned
by
the
grand
jury,
and
the
respect
that
that
grand
jury
is
entitled
to
must
be
responded
to
by
the
court.
you
can't
do
it.
and
when
you
massage
it
around
to
make
it
more
convenient,
it
won't
fly.
i'm
going
back
to
the
old
1886
ex
parte
bain
where,
in
this
case,
we
contend
that
there
was
no--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
wouldn't
say
so.
i
think
the
court
has
quoted
it
up
until
the
last
few
years.
in
fact,
i
think
this
last
term,
in
1983,
there
was
some
discussion.
i
realize
your
honor--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well,
the
reason
was
in
that
case,
there
was
a
very
narrow
striking
from
the
indictment;
"and
the
comptroller
general
of
the
united
states.
"
those
words,
that
striking,
was
enough
to
reverse
it.
and
i
would
say
in
haec
verba,
if
it
resolved
those
particular
facts,
your
honor
is
correct
and
i
think
your
honor's
position
was
that,
in
the
case
you
cited,
that
it's
limited
to
those
facts.
and
i
agree.
but
i'm
saying
that
taking
stirone,
where
we
had
the
changing
of
the
allegations,
and
then
we
turn
it
around
and
we
see
in
this
particular
case.
ex
parte
bain,
where
it
says
it's
a
jurisdictional
error.
our
position
is
there
was
no
waiver.
from
the
outset
he
said,
i
want
the
specific
substance
on
the
telephone
count.
and
the
judge
says,
"you
got
any
quarrel
with
that?
"
who
quarrels
with
the
judge?
and
then
after
it
was
all
over,
you
take
a
look
at...
i
think
it's
joint
appendix,
page
26...
the
last
line;
he
said,
"do
you
have
any
quarrel
with
the
instructions?
"
"none,
other
than
i've
already
stated.
"
so
i
think
that
that
issue
was
presumed--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
believe
there
was
a
case
where
there's
two
options,
where
the
jury
could
one
way
on
two
options,
and
where
they
could
find
guilty
on
one
and
not
on
the
other.
i
think
it
was
yates,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
and
i
think
this
court
held
that
you
can't
make
that
option.
if
the
court
is
referring
to
the
fact
that
both
are
schedule
2
substances,
which
they
are,
i
would
point
out
just--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
don't
think
in
terms
of
the
charge
here,
because
the
charge
was
cocaine,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
that
they
can
substitute
qualudes
for
cocaine.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no.
that
is
what
the
judge's
instruction
was.
an
objection
was
made
at
trial,
and
we're
contending
in
this
court
that
that
was
improper.
and,
further,
in
dealing
with
schedule
2
of
title
xxi,
section
812,
there
is
some
almost
25
substances
listed;
the
opium,
cocaine,
21
enumerated,
and
then
anything
containing
methamphetamine.
but
under
section
811
of
title
xxi,
the
attorney
general
can
add
to
this
list.
so
we're
dealing
with
a
unique
case
where
there's
tremendous
flexibility,
and
i
think
even
the
fundamental
principle
of
notice,
an
issue
raised
in
the
brief,
that
there
has
to
be
some
designation.
and
when
at
the
jury's
impasse,
and
there's
a
charge
of
cocaine,
and
now
we
want
to
switch
it
to
qualudes,
i
think
it's
unfair.
what
this
court
has
before
it
is
an
unseemly
case,
with
an
unreliable
record.
trial
defense
counsel
in
this
case,
subsequent
to
the
hearing
by
the
court
of
appeals...
the
charges
were
filed
after
this
case
was
taken
under
submission...
was
convicted
of
accessory
after
the
fact
for
being
in
a
conspiracy
with
the
fugitive
husband
of
the
respondent
and,
as
a
result,
received
four
years
and,
during
that
proceeding,
was
also
convicted
for
false
statements
made
in
response
to
bond
containing
this
particular
case.
a
reference
was
made
as
to
where
$200,000
was.
that
disloyalty
must
be
noted
by
this
court.
it's
not
a
matter
for
2255
relief
because--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well,
i
think
it
affects
the
posture
of
this
case
before
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
dunn
issue,
your
honor?
i
think,
again,
it's
just
wood
v.
georgia,
where
this
court,
when
it
dealt
with
probation
revocation
where
there's
a
possibility
of
conflict,
thought
it
best
to
remand
the
case.
and
i
think
that,
given
the
fact
that
you
want
a
viable
case
or
controversy,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
found
it
infected
by
unreliable
counsel,
it
would
be
inappropriate.
and
i
think
the
role
of
counsel
in
this
case
leaves
much
to
be
questioned.
specifically,
on
the
dunn
issue,
there
was
some
question
as
to
what
was
the
evidence
stated,
and
i
alluded
to
in
the
briefs,
to
reference
where
counsel
almost
conceded
the
existence
of
some--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--no,
your
honor.
and
that...
it
was
different
counsel.
and
in
this
particular
case,
we
feel
that
the
prejudice
almost
permeates
the
record.
in
this
case
at
the
outset,
and
i
believe
counsel
for
the
government
submitted
a
supplemental
transcript,
19
may
1982,
page
6.
there's
a
reference
to
prosecutor,
prior
to
the
start
of
trail,
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
respondent's
counsel,
defense
counsel
below,
was
in
communication
with
the
fugitive
husband.
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
there
was
a
reference
brought
out
that
this
lawyer
was
carrying
letters
between
the
fugitive
husband,
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
named
conspiracy
in
the
case,
to
the
respondent
at
jail.
and,
third,
there
was
a
reference
that
this
particular
lawyer,
at
sentencing,
somewhat
agitated
about
the
anticipated
sentence,
said;
"well,
what
do
you
want?
"
"now
you're
saying
is
what
can
you
give
me.
"
the
prosecutor,
alluding...
"what
can
you
give
me?
"
"i'll
cut
you
loose.
"
indicating--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--no,
they
didn't,
your
honor.
what
they
ruled
against
was
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
this
issue
was
never
addressed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
because
i'm
citing
wood
v.
georgia,
where
the
court
had
a
similar
situation,
where
it
was
a
matter
not
noticed
until
it
hit
this
court,
where
the
imperfection
of
counsel,
the
potential
for
conflict,
in
this
case
we
feel
an
adjudication
of
conflict
has
been
made,
and
therefore
it's
somewhat
questionable
why
this
court
is
here.
i
have
also
moved
that
this
case
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
cannot...
i
cannot
accept
the
court's
characterization.
i
feel
that
each
of
these
issues
are
well
met,
and
i
think
that,
as
the
court
said,
i
believe
it
was
you,
justice
rehnquist,
in
your
dissent
in
yermian,
where
any
issue
raised
or
not
raised
below
may
be
submitted
to
this
court
in
support
of
the
lower
court's
determination.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
i'm
saying...
and
that's
a...
i
have
petitioned
for
cert
in
this
case,
and
the
court
denied
cert
on
the
petition,
her
petition.
so
you
get
selective
review
to
the
government.
you
took
only
that
portion
of
the
conviction
that
the
government
sought
to
have
reviewed.
and
i'm
saying,
in
the
context
of
that
portion
which
is
reversal,
that
the
suggestion
in
this
case
of
remand
for
further
inquiry
is
certainly
within
the
parameters
of
that
which
court
granted
reviewing.
i
would
think
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it's
not
the
type
of
case
that
the
court
would
want
to
issue
out
or
promulgate,
use
one...
i'm
somewhat
embarrassed
to
present
this
posture
of
it,
but
i
feel
that
much
like
in
wood
v.
georgia,
the
court
must
address
that
issue.
thank
you
very
much.
