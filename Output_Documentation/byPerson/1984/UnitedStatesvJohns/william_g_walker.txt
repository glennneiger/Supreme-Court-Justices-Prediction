mr.
william
g.
walker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
there
is
a
fundamental
disagreement
between
counsel
on
the
various
sides
as
to
what
the
issue
in
this
case
is.
the
government
argues
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
government
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
automobile
at
the
scene.
we
disagree
with
that.
we
think
that
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
government
was
involved
in
an
automobile
search
at
the
scene
or
at
any
time.
mr.
william
g.
walker
no,
sir,
we
do
not.
our
position
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
before
this
court
is
that
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
indication
that
there
was
ever
an
automobile
search
in
this
case.
the
focus
of
the
police
officers
was
solely
and
exclusively
on
the
packages
from
the
moment
that
they
arrived
on
the
scene
until
the
time
that
the
core
samples
were
taken
later.
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
before
this
court
that
the
police
officers
were
ever
concerned
with
the
types
of
vehicles
as
vehicles.
mr.
william
g.
walker
i
take
issue
with
your
conclusion,
respectfully,
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
fact
against
us.
if
you
go
back
to
the
district
court
opinion,
the
district
court
opinion
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
police
officers
from
some
thirty
feet
saw
a
group
of
packages,
that
as
they
approached
the
packages,
they
knew
that
those
were
the
types
of
packages
that
commonly
were
used
to
put
marijuana
in,
they
smelled
marijuana
coming
from
the
packages.
they
had
been...
there
had
been
other
officers
on
the
scene
about
an
hour
earlier
who
had
looked
in
those
vehicles,
had
smelled
no
marijuana,
had
seen
no
packages.
the
officers
concluded,
and
the
testimony
is
unequivocal
on
this
point,
that
the
officers
believed
that
the
marijuana
was
only
in
the
packages.
in
fact,
the
government
at
the
district
court
level
argued
that
there
was
no
search
because
they
knew
that
the
marijuana
was
in
the
packages.
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
when
they
got
to
the
vehicles,
they
"viewed
the
packages"
that
were--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--yes,
sir,
but
the
district
court
found
only
that
they
viewed
the
packages,
not
that
they
did
any
search.
when
it
then
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
they
bad
probable
cause
to
conduct
an
automobile
search,
not
that
they
ever
conducted
an
automobile
search.
so
they
never
found
that
fact
against
us.
mr.
william
g.
walker
according
to
the
evidence,
what
happened
was
the
vehicles
went
down
to
an
airstrip
in
bowie,
arizona.
they
were
spotted
and
surveilled
by
police
officers
all
the
way
from
tucson.
when
they
got--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--we
agree
with
part
of
that.
it
was
during
the
daylight
hours,
and
what
happened
was
the
police
were
given
a
tip
by
a
confidential
informant
in
tucson,
which
is
approximately
100
miles
from
this
site,
and
in
fact,
they
had
continuous
surveillance
if
these
two
vehicles
from
the
time
that
they
left
tucson,
arizona
earlier
that
morning
until
they
got
to
the
landing
site
and
met
with
the
airplanes.
so
it
was
not--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
our
point
is--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
walker
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
walker
that's
a
very
important
question
to
our
theory
of
the
case.
the
vehicles
were
camper
trucks,
and
what
happened
was--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--no,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
walker
the
parcels
were
in
the
pickup
portion
of
the
vehicles.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
sir,
they
were.
and--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--yes,
ma'am,
the
vehicles
were
driven
to
the
stationhouse
and--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--yes.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor,
yes,
your
honor.
our
point
is
that
what
ross
says...
and
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
the
language
of
this
court
in
ross...
that
if
you
are
in
the
midst
of
an
automobile
search
and
you
need
to
search
packages
to
complete
the
automobile
search,
then
it
is
justifiable
to
search
the
packages
without
a
warrant.
here
is
clearly
what
justice
stevens
said
in
the
opinion
in
ross.
then
a
legitimate
search
is
under
way...
and
we
are
talking
about
an
automobile
search...
nice
distinctions
between
glove
compartments,
upholstered
seats,
trunks
and
wrapped
packages
must
give
way
to
the
interest
in
the
prompt
and
efficient
completion
of
the
task
at
hand,
and
the
whole
grounding
of
ross,
of
this
court's
opinion
in
ross,
is
that
if
you
are
in
the
midst
of
an
automobile
search,
it
would
defeat
law
enforcement
purposes
to
say,
well,
you
can
search
certain
portions
of
the
automobile
but
not
all
of
it.
the
situation
is
radically
different,
as
it
was
in
chadwick
and
sanders,
if
the
focus
is
on
not
the
vehicle
as
a
whole
but
rather,
on
a
particular
item
which
happens
to
be
reposed
in
an
automobile.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
walker
no,
sir.
i
think
the
type
of
vehicle
is
important
here
only
for
one
reason,
and
that
is
that
the
packages
of
marijuana
were
in
a
separate
portion
from
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
vehicle.
if
in
fact
the
police
officers
had
really
been
concerned
with
the
vehicles
in
question,
certainly
they
would
have
searched
the
whole
vehicles.
they
didn't
do
that.
in
fact,
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
even
went
into
the
passenger
compartments
where
the
people
were
located
to
search
that
at
all.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
police
officers,
according
to
the
district
court,
from
30
feet
away
saw
the
packages,
smelled
the
marijuana,
knew
in
their
own
minds
exactly
where
it
was,
got
up
to
the
vehicles,
said
take
the
vehicles
to
the
stationhouse.
they
took
the
vehicles
to
the
stationhouse,
unloaded
the
packages--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
walker
they
could
not
have
opened
the
packages
because
what
the
police
were
concerned
about
in
this
case
and
what
they
were
involved
in
was
not
an
automobile
search,
but
rather,
a
search
of
packages,
and
in
chadwick
where
the--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
walker
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
not
without
a
warrant.
the
general
rule
is--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
walker
if
the
packages
had
been--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
sir.
according
to
this
court's
dictates,
that
goes
to
the
probable
cause
but
not
to
vitiate
the
warrant
requirement.
mr.
william
g.
walker
no,
ma'am,
but
i
think
what
would
have
happened,
as
a
matter
of--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
william
g.
walker
it's--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--it's
not
because
of
a
possessory
interest
in
counterfeit
goods
that
we
allow
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
setting.
any
time
there
is
contraband
you
would
have
that
argument,
that
since
the
person
had
no
interest
in
it,
therefore
he
can't
assert
his
fourth
amendment
privilege.
the
court
has--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--well,
i
think
that
the
thing
that
is
wrong
with
that
government
is
that
the
reason
for
the
exclusionary
rule
is
as
a
prophylactic
effect,
to
prevent
the
police
from
engaging
in
illegal
behavior,
and
the
fact
that
it
might
not
help
in
this
cast
doesn't
mean
that
the
exclusionary
rule
wouldn't
help
in
cases
where
we
don't
know
what
is
in
the
packages.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
walker
no,
sir.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
mr.
william
g.
walker
well,
it
is
not
the
lapse
of
time
that
damages
us,
it
is
the
fact
that
since
this
investigation
was
always
an
investigation
of
packages,
people
have
a
high
expectation
of
privacy
in
packages,
and
this
court
has
frequently
said,
way
back
to
the
jackson
case
where
in
the
mail
people
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
packages,
that
people's
expectation
of
packages
is
high.
mr.
william
g.
walker
well,
i
disagree
with
your
honor
to
the
extent
that
i
think
this
court
has
consistently
found
that
regardless
of
the
nature
or
type
of
package
or
the
situation
with
packages,
people
have
a
high
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
packages.
mr.
william
g.
walker
if
the
police
are
in
the
pursuit
of
an
automobile
search,
then
dispute
a
person's
high
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
package,
this
court
has
allowed
the
search,
not
because
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
lessened,
but
because
of
the
fact
that
the
police
are
engaged
in
an
automobile
search,
the
completion
of
which
is
dependent
on
being
able
to
search
everything
in
the
automobile.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
what
this
court
said
in
ross
was
if
you
are
in
the
middle
of
an
automobile
search
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
come
across
a
package,
you
can't
search
the
package,
it
frustrates
the
auto
search.
but
there
is
no
auto
search
in
this
case.
mr.
william
g.
walker
we
would
support
them
as
a
backup
position,
but
we
disagree
when
they
conclude
that
these
packages
could
have
been
searched
on
the
scene.
mr.
william
g.
walker
well,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
your
honor.
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
this
court
has
long
ago
abolished
the
distinction
between
worthy
and
unworthy
containers
and
has
found
that
the
nature
of
a
container--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--well,
that
is
really
the
plain
view
argument,
and
that
is
an
argument
which
is
not
being
urged
upon
this
court
by
the
petitioner.
it
was
abandoned
after
the
court
of
appeals
argument,
and
in
fact--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
walker
burnt
them?
mr.
william
g.
walker
if
they
open
it
to
make
sure,
that's
a
search,
and
i
think
they
would
have
to
have
a
warrant
for
that.
mr.
william
g.
walker
before
they
opened
it
to
see
what
was
in
it.
mr.
william
g.
walker
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
william
g.
walker
i
think
it
would
be
required
before
there
was
any
physical
intrusion
into
the
package.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
what
i
am--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--why
didn't
they
claim
it?
mr.
william
g.
walker
well,
for
the
same
reason
that
people
that
are
involved
in
criminal
activity
never
claim
contraband,
but
that
doesn't--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--i
think
it
is...
i
think
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--what
i
am
suggesting
to
this
court
is
that
you
have
for
years
and
years
recognized
that
people
have
a
high
expectation
of
privacy
in
containers,
even
though
they
may
contain
contraband.
i
don't
think
that
is
a
novel
concept.
mr.
william
g.
walker
at
the
trial
court
the
position
of
the
defendants
were
twofold,
your
honor,
number
one,
that
this
was
not
a
vehicle
search
and
that
there
was
a
warrant
needed
for
the
packages
for
that
reason,
and
number
two,
at
the
time
that
we
were
in
the
trial
court,
we
were
arguing
robbins,
which
was
far
different.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor,
we
were.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
walker
it
was
our
position
initially
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
ross
came
down
while
we
were
on
appeal.
so
we
then
asked
to
submit
additional
briefs
on
the
ross
issue
and
were
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
william
g.
walker
what
change
in
the
facts
in
this
case?
mr.
william
g.
walker
nothing,
your
honor.
it
has
been
our
position
since
the
beginning
that
a
warrant
was
needed
for
this--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
g.
walker
we
didn't
argue--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--yes.
mr.
william
g.
walker
our
argument
initially
was
that
there
was
no
automobile
search,
but
if
there
was
one,
then
robbins
applied.
we
didn't
focus
in
on
that
issue
to
the
extent
that
we
have
here
before
this
court,
obviously
because
at
the
time
we
thought
robbins
was
controlling.
but
we
did
not
take
an
unequivocal
position
that
this
was
an
automobile
search
in
robbins.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
walker
well,
on
page
139
of
the
trial
record,
on
question
by
the
prosecutor,
the
officer
who
was
at
the
scene
indicated
that
they
did
not
do
a
search.
mr.
william
g.
walker
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
more
probable
cause
in
this
case
than
there
was
for
the
court
in
sanders?
mr.
william
g.
walker
well,
the
facts,
as
i
remember
them,
in
sanders,
your
honor,
were
that
there
were
two
trips
by
the
defendant
to
the
vehicle
in
sanders.
the
first
trip
what
he
did
was
he
took
a
bunch
of
personal
luggage
and
put
it
in
the
automobile.
he
then
went
back
and
got
the
green
briefcase
and
put
it
in
the
glove
compartment.
so
you
could
make
the
same
argument
in
sanders
that
the
police
officers
had
the
right
to
search
the
passenger
compartment
because
there
was
other
luggage
of
the
defendant
there,
and--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--it
was
a
taxicab,
but--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--no,
sir,
but
there
was
personal
luggage
of
the
defendant
that
was
put
in
the
taxicab.
mr.
william
g.
walker
my
point
is
simply
that
it
is
not
whether
you
have
probable
cause
to
make
an
automobile
search
that
should
be
dispositive,
it
is
whether
you
are
engaged
in
one.
mr.
william
g.
walker
no,
sir.
it
is
the
reason
for
the
search,
just
as
in
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
case.
this
court
has
held
that
if
you
search
an
automobile
incident
to
somebody's
arrest,
since
the
reason
for
that
search
is
to
allow
the
protection
of
the
police
officer,
we
say
it
is
okay,
but
if
you
then
search
that
same
automobile,
not
because
it
is
for
the
protection
of
the
police
officer
incident
to
arrest,
but
later
at
the
stationhouse,
even
though
you
could
have
done
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
we
don't
allow
it.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
walker
no,
sir.
my
position
is
that
regardless
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
conduct
an
automobile
search,
there
was
no
automobile
search
in
progress,
and
if
i
might
quote,
your
honor,
from
your
own
language
in
ross--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--yes,
sir.
you
say
in
the
course
of
a
legitimate
warrantless
search
of
an
automobile,
police
are
entitled
to
open
containers.
there
is
no
automobile
search
going
on
here.
our
position
on
that
issue
is
very
simple.
the
focus
of
this
investigation,
just
as
the
focus
of
the
police
investigation
in
chadwick
and
in
sanders,
was
reposed
entirely
on
these
containers.
in
fact,
the
government's
argument
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
their
interest
was
so
focused
on
the
containers
that
there
was
no
search
because
the
marijuana
was
in
plain
view.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our
position.
our
position
is
that
the
issue
here
is
not
a
lapse
of
time;
the
issue
here
is
whether
there
was
an
automobile
search
going
on
where
they
knew
there
was
contraband
but
didn't
know
where
it
was,
as
in
ross,
where
they
had
heard
that
there
was
contraband
and
had
to
search
the
whole
vehicle
to
find
it--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--and
in
fact,
all
of
the
evidence
is
undisputed
that
that
is
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
william
g.
walker
it
is
what
the
police
are
in
the
process
of
doing,
if
they
are
in
the
process
of
conducting
an
automobile
search.
mr.
william
g.
walker
well,
this
court
has
found
consistently
that
when
you
are
applying
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement,
the
exception
should
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
william
g.
walker
regardless
of
how
you
read
ross,
though,
your
honor,
ross
applies
to
situations
where
there
is
a
legitimate
automobile
search
in
progress.
i
think
that
it
would
distort
the
meaning
of
ross
even
in
a
liberal
sense
to
say
that
any
package
that
happens
to
be
reposed
in
an
automobile
can
be
searched
even
if
the
police
aren't
engaged
in
an
automobile
search.
mr.
william
g.
walker
if
he
had
said
that
and
then
they
had
been
engaged
in
an
automobile
search,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
walker
well,
the
only
thing
wrong
with
it
was
that
the
entire
focus
of
this
inquiry
was
on
the
packages.
mr.
william
g.
walker
there
was
no
search
of
the
vehicle.
there
was
never
any
search
of
the
vehicles
in
this
case.
mr.
william
g.
walker
but
if
the
focus--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--that's
not...
that's
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
william
g.
walker
i
think
if
you
were
in
the
process
of
making
a
vehicle
search--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--then
i
think
you
are
doing
a
vehicle
search,
but
you
are
not
doing
a
vehicle
search
here.
i
think
most
of
these
arguments
could
have
been
made
against
the
petitioner
in
chadwick
or
in
sanders,
and
in
chadwick
and
sanders,
even
though
these
items
were
in
vehicles,
the
court
said
these
are
not
vehicle
search.
these
are
package
searches.
mr.
william
g.
walker
well,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
justice
stevens,
for
this
reason.
in
sanders
the
facts
clearly
established
that
there
was
other
luggage
of
the
defendant's
that
was
in
that
vehicle.
now,
that
luggage
could
have
been
searched
to
find
evidence
of
the
crime,
and
yet
it
wasn't
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
further
that
was
important
to
this
court,
it
was
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
was
on
the
other
things
or
whether
it
was
exclusively
on
the
green
suitcase.
he
came
out
with
a
whole
bunch
of
luggage.
mr.
william
g.
walker
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
government
grounds
its
argument
on.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
sir.
that
i
think
is
wrong,
because
the
whole
reason
to
relax
the
rule
for
a
package
search
when
a
package
is
in
a
vehicle
is
to
allow
police
to
complete
their
task
of
searching
the
vehicle.
if
they
are
not
involved
in
a
vehicle
search,
why
then
should
the
rule
be
relaxed
to
allow
a
package
search
without
a
warrant?
the
facts
in
this
case
indicate
that
the
police
officers
arrived
there
some
five
to
ten
minutes
after
the
packages
had
been
loaded
onto
the
trucks,
that
in
fact,
what
happened
was
the
packages
were
taken
out
of
the
airplanes
and
were
then
loaded
into
the
vehicles.
let's
suppose
that
the
police
officers
in
this
case
had
arrived
five
to
ten
minutes
earlier,
and
when
they
got
there
the
packages
which
happened
to
be
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
pickup
trucks
had
been
sitting
on
the
ground
instead.
at
that
point
i
think
it
would
be
clear
that
the
government
would
not
be
able
to
argue
that
just
because
they
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
automobiles
they
therefore
could
open
the
packages
without
a
warrant.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
shouldn't
make
a
difference
that
they
get
there
five
minutes
later
and
that
the
bales
and
boxes
of
marijuana
happened
to
be
sitting
in
the
back
end
of
a
camper
truck.
mr.
william
g.
walker
my
argument,
if
the
court
please,
is
based
on
the
plain
reading
of
ross
which
says
that
if
you
are
in
the
process
of
an
auto
search
you
can
do
it,
but
just
the
justification
to
do
an
automobile
search
doesn't
do
it
for
you.
i
think
it
is
analogous
in
a
sense
to
the
pretext
arrest
area,
where
if
somebody
is
going
100
miles
an
hour
and
a
police
officer
stops
the
vehicle
because
he
is
going
100
miles
an
hour,
and
then
you
smell
marijuana
or
you
see
marijuana
in
plain
view,
that
arrest
is
okay.
but
if
somebody
is
going
100
miles
an
hour
and
you
stop
them
not
for
that
reason
but
because
you
suspect
them
of
being
a
drug
dealer,
and
then
you
see
marijuana
in
plain
view,
that
is
a
pretext
arrest,
and
it
is
no
good.
in
that
situation
the
difference
is
not
in
what
the
police
are
allowed
to
do,
because
clearly
in
both
cases
they
would
be
allowed
to
stop
the
driver.
it
is
rather
in
what
they
were
doing.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
our
second
argument.
the
second
argument
is
that
even
if
you
assume
that
they
could
at
the
scene
have
searched
these
packages,
that
the
three
days
later
takes
away
the
reason
for
allowing
the
search.
you
have
to
understand
that
we
have
got
a
collision
here
between
the
principles
that
govern
package
searches
and
the
principles
that
govern
automobile
searches.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is,
and
i
think
the
cases
that
this
court--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--the
difference
is
that
we
have
historically
allowed
automobile
searches
not
only
in
situations
where
there
are
exigencies,
but
even
days
later,
because
historically
people
have
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
in
their
automobiles.
they
don't,
however,
have
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
in
their
packages,
and
once...
if
you
do
an
automobile
search
three
days
later,
then
in
order
to
complete
the
automobile
search
and
because
we
allow
searches
of
automobiles,
we
would
then
allow
the
search
of
the
packages.
but
if
the
packages
are
taken
out
of
the
automobile
and
stored
in
a
place
that
is
separate
and
apart
from
the
automobile,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
has
ever
been
an
automobile
search,
then
in
what
realistic
sense
can
you
say
that
the
opening
of
these
packages
is
an
automobile
search?
mr.
william
g.
walker
well,
the
interests
of
the
client
suffer
only
because
the
client
has
always
had
a
high
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
package.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
walker
in
chadwick
this
court
found
a
high
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
trunk
even
though
it
had
contraband
in
it,
and
in
sanders
the
court
found--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--well,
but
the
expectation
of
privacy
was
the
same.
mr.
william
g.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
defendants
testified
in
this
case
that
he
had
a
high
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
william
g.
walker
i
would
like
to
answer
a
question
that
justice
stevens
posed
of
government's
counsel.
you
asked
who
would
the
burden
of
proof
be
on
with
respect
to
the
time
period.
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
clearly
be
on
the
government,
for
this
reason.
we
generally
go
by
the
standard
that
you
must
have
a
warrant
in
all
cases
unless
we
find
an
exception,
and
the
exception
must
be
proven
by
the
government.
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
proving
each
essential
element
of
an
exception,
and
if
the
government
wants
to
prove
that
an
exception
was
reasonable
in
this
case,
the
government
then
has
the
responsibility
of
proving
that
the
time
period--
mr.
william
g.
walker
--soon
thereafter
i
think
is
consistent
with
this
court's
dictate
in
robbins
where
you
yourself
said
soon
thereafter,
and
i
think
what
the
court
found,
the
court
of
appeals
found
is
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
justify
that
it
was
soon
thereafter,
and
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
it
is
soon
thereafter.
mr.
william
g.
walker
i
would
agree
with
that,
and
for
that
reason
i
think
this
is
a
bad
case
for
this
court
to
decide
on
certiorari,
but
if
you
are
going
to
decide
it,
then
i
think
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
say
the
burden
of
proof
is
no
the
government
to
prove
the
exception,
the
exception
as
enunciated
in
ross
clearly
says
it
has
got
to
be
soon
thereafter,
and
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record
that
it
was
soon
thereafter.
mr.
william
g.
walker
no,
sir,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
if
it
had
been
done
soon
thereafter
it
would
have
been
okay.
