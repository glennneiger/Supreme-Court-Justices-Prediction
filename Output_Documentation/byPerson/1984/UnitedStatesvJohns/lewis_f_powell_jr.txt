mr.
walker,
what
position
did
the
defendant
in
this
case
take
at
the
trial
court?
justice
jr.
you
were
relying
on
robbins.
justice
jr.
that
was
a
vehicle
search
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
jr.
was
that
your
position
also
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
jr.
yes.
what
charge
in
the
facts
occurred
between
the
time
you
relied
on
the
automobile
search
case
and
the
time
you
now
rely
on
an
entirely
different
theory?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
that
there
was
no
automobile
search?
justice
jr.
was
it
your
position
from
the

that
there
was
no
automobile
search?
justice
jr.
you
relied
on
robbins--
justice
jr.
--and
to
rely
on
robbins,
you
had
to
state,
i
assume,
or
argue
that
there
was
an
automobile
search.
