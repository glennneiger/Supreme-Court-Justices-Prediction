justice
marshall
i
can
see
another
line,
the
line
being
when
you
take
it
to
the
stationhouse,
shouldn't
you
get
it
then?
shouldn't
you
search
it
when
you
get
it
to
the
stationhouse?
justice
marshall
well,
i'm
not
a
respondent.
i'm
asking
the
question.
justice
marshall
hasn't
this
court
said
that
once
you
take
the
vehicle,
you
can
inventory
it?
justice
marshall
if
you
inventoried
it
at
the
station,
you
would
have
found
this
marijuana,
wouldn't
you?
justice
marshall
hmm?
justice
marshall
yes,
and
they
could
have
done
that
in
less
than
three
days.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
justice
marshall
could
they
have
opened
up
one
of
those
packages
at
that
point?
justice
marshall
why
not?
justice
marshall
well,
it
was
the
packages
that
they
took,
right?
justice
marshall
well,
couldn't
they
have
opened
what
they
took?
justice
marshall
what's
the
rule
at
the
point
of
arrest?
justice
marshall
at
the
point
of
arrest
they
had
what,
hold
them
there,
then
go
get
a
warrant?
justice
marshall
you
would
still
have
to
go
get
a
warrant.
justice
marshall
do
you
still
claim
privacy?
justice
marshall
why
didn't
they
claim
it?
justice
marshall
why
didn't
they
claim
those
bales?
justice
marshall
but
you
still
have
privacy
in
something
you
don't
want
to
admit
is
yours?
justice
marshall
well,
then,
you
keep
putting
quotes
on
things.
would
you
put
quotes
on
that
privacy?
justice
marshall
in
this
case,
would
it
have
been
all
right
if
the
officer
had
said,
"we
are
going
to
conduct
a
search
of
this
vehicle?
"
justice
marshall
so
the
only
thing
wrong
was
they
didn't
make
those--
justice
marshall
--oh.
well,
what
are
you
searching
the
vehicle
for
other
than
the
packages?
