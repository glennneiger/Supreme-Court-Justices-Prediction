do
you
think
this,
do
you
think
this
opening
the
package
to
make
a
test,
is
that
a
search?
is
that
something
that--
justice
white
--it
was
just
a
field
test,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
it
was
just
a
test,
it
was
just
a
chemical
test
that
would
make
more
sure
of
what--
justice
white
well,
what
if
they...
what
if
they
just
drove
the
trucks
to
the
stationhouse
and
let
them
sit?
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
packages
in
them
are
marijuana
and
they
just
let
the
trucks
sit
for
a
month,
and
then
they
finally
get
around
to
having
to
prepare
for
trial,
so
they
want
better
proof,
so
they
seize
the...
they
open
the
packages
and
test
them?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
the
trucks
were
forfeitable,
i
suppose.
justice
white
what
were
you
reading
from
there,
mr.
horowitz?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
what
would
the
government
have
to
do
before
it
burnt
these
packages?
justice
white
what
would
the
government
have
to
do
before
it
confiscated
these
packages
and
burnt
them?
justice
white
burnt
the
marijuana,
yes.
let's
just
assume
there
was
never
a
criminal
prosecution
filed
against
these
people,
they
just
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
marijuana,
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that's
what
it
is,
so
they
open
it
to
make
sure
and
burn
it.
justice
white
before
they
can
burn
it.
justice
white
well,
you
don't
think
they
could
just
have
burned
it
without
opening
it?
justice
white
suppose
there
had
been
one
package,
and
it
was
a
big
truck,
and
you
didn't
know
whether
it
was
in
the
back
or
in
the
front,
and
so
you
had
to
search
the
vehicle
to
find
the
package?
under
your
provision
there
was
a
search
of
the
vehicle
in
progress--
justice
white
--and
then
you
find
the
package.
could
you
open
it?
no.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
if
you
did?
justice
white
only
to...
only
to
find
the
package.
