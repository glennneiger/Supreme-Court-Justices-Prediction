justice
rehnquist
--is
it
pretty
well
conceded
that
there
are
bounds
within
which
the
search
took
place,
that
it
was
at
least
one
day
and
not
more
than
three
days,
or
is
it
just
totally
unknown?
justice
rehnquist
they
just
wanted
to
have
it
tested.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
part
of
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
would
depend
on
whether
you
concede
that
there
was
an
outer
limit
to
the
time
in
which
the
government
was
permitted
to
open
these
under
the
fourth
amendment.
you
have
intimated
that
perhaps
there
were
other
considerations
of
some
sort
that
might
prevent
the
government
from
opening
the
parcel
a
year
later.
are
those
fourth
amendment
considerations?
justice
rehnquist
so
suppose
that
the
search
was...
seized...
a
bunch
of
bales
of
cotton
were
seized
and
couple
weeks
goes
by,
and
the
seizure
of
the
bales
was
perfectly
legitimate,
and
the
owner
says,
well,
look,
i
want
to
sell
these
bales,
this
is
a
good
time
of
year
to
sell
them.
the
government
just
can't
hang
on
indefinitely
in
the
face
of
a
request
like
that
unless
they
have
got
some
reason
to
keep
them,
can
they?
justice
rehnquist
--well,
that
ordinarily
is
a
factual
question,
i
suppose,
you
know,
if
the
focus
of
the
officers
is
a
relevant
fact.
the
court
of
appeals
resolved
the
facts
against
you,
or
at
least
it
resolved
the
legal
issue
against
you.
do
you
take
issue
with
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
of
the
facts
or
with
their
resolution
of
the
legal
issue?
justice
rehnquist
the
packages
were
in
the
vehicle.
justice
rehnquist
--you
say
that
the
police
never
made
a
vehicle
search.
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
mean
of...
i
guess
they
never
searched
the
parcels
until
several
days
after
they
were
removed--
justice
rehnquist
--from
the
vehicle.
where
were
the
parcels
seized?
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
it
take
a
long
time
to
answer
the
question?
justice
rehnquist
where
were
the
parcels
seized?
were
they
on
the
vehicles?
justice
rehnquist
so
they
were
seized
on
the
vehicles--
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
your
point,
i
take
it,
is
that
even
though
these
things
were
loaded
on
these
trucks
at
the
time
the
police
saw
them,
the
police
would
have
had
to
get
a
warrant
to
search
them
right
at
that
moment.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
your...
the
success
of
your
position
would
depend
on
later
showing,
i
suppose,
under
your
terms
that
the
police
wanted
only
to
seize
these
particular
bales,
and
that
they
would
not
have
searched
any
other
part
of
the
truck.
justice
rehnquist
but
you
have
to
know
at
the...
you
have
to
know
that
something
later
is
going
to
happen
at
the
time
you
decide
whether
to
get
a
warrant
or
not.
i
suppose
it
is
the
subjective
motivation
of
the
police:
are
you
going
to
search
the
whole
truck
or
are
you
just
going
to
seize
the
bale?
justice
rehnquist
that
really
would
work
quite
a
twist
in
ross,
i
think,
because
you
are
imputing,
imputing
kind
of
a
motivation
thing
that
certainly
isn't
in
ross.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
you
will
find
that
a
majority
of
the
court
agree
that
ross
should
be
narrowly
construed
at
all.
ross
defines
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirements
to
be
applied
according
to
its
terms,
not
narrowly.
justice
rehnquist
but
under
the
reasoning
of
the
automobile
search
exception,
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
if
they
are
in
an
automobile,
the
traditional
reasons
for
allowing
search
on
probable
cause
without
a
warrant
apply.
if
they
are
not
in
an
automobile,
they
don't.
that's
the
bright
line
that
ross
drew,
and
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
just
tending
to
blur
it.
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
bring
the
stuff
in
at
bowie
rather
than
tucson
unless
you
want
some
privacy
in
it.
