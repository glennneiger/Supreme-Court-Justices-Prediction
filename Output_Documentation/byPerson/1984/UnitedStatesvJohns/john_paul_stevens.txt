justice
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
can
i
interrupt
you
on
this,
and
we
will
get
to
this
argument.
i
am
troubled
by
the
state
of
the
record
in
this
case
because
you
can't
tell
when
the
search
took
place.
you
cite
in
your
brief
some
reference
to
the
fact
that
search
apparently...
i
guess
the
bales
were
opened
a
day
later,
and
there
is
apparently
something
that
suggests
that.
justice
stevens
in
your
superstition,
you
suggest
that
the
issue
is
can
they
serve
several
days
later,
and
then
in
the
briefs
argue
about
it
being
three
days
later,
and
we
really
can't
tell
from
the
record
when
the
search
takes
place.
what
i
would
like
to
ask
you
is
who
do
you
think
has
the...
i
would
think
you
would
assume
that
if
it
took
place
a
year
later,
it
would
be
unreasonable,
at
some
point
in
time
maybe
you
can't
search.
justice
stevens
but
assuming
there's
a
period
of
time
at
which
there
is
a
duty
to
go
ahead
and
open
the
stuff
without
a
warrant...
if
you
don't
want
to
get
a
warrant,
who
has
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
delay
was
either
too
long
or
was
not
too
long?
justice
stevens
well,
if
you
are
right
in
that,
doesn't
that
end
the
lawsuit,
because
they
surely
haven't
proved
it.
i
mean,
shouldn't
they
lose
on
that
ground,
if
you...
it
seems
to
me
somebody
has
got
to
decide
who
has
the
burden,
and
why
wouldn't
that
end
the
case.
justice
stevens
but
as
you
point
out,
nobody
argued
it.
so
then--
justice
stevens
i
read
your
brief
as
conceding
that
because
you
said
that
this
is
the
hypothetical
warrant
situation,
and
you
surely
have
a
duty
to
execute
a
warrant
within
some
period
of
time.
you
can't
just
let
it
sit
there
for
ten
years.
justice
stevens
and
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
it
was.
justice
stevens
--i
thought
you
were
arguing
the
case
on
the
hypothesis
that
there
was
no
plain
view,
that
you
lost...
that
therefore,
that
this
container,
even
though
it
was
not
a
great
secret
about
what
was
in
it,
really
legally
was
the
same
as
if
it
was
a
locked
briefcase.
justice
stevens
that's
your
position,
yes?
justice
stevens
i
am
not
suggesting
that
makes
you
wrong,
but
i
mean,
i
think
we
have
either
got
to
decide
it
as
a
container
case
or
as
a
bale
of
marijuana
case.
justice
stevens
but
then,
if
it
were
a
locked
briefcase,
who
would
have
to
prove
it
was
or
was
not
searched
within
the
month?
that's
the
question
that
interests
me,
and
i
don't
see
anybody
addressing
it.
justice
stevens
well,
but
you
just
conceded
it
would
be
critical
in
the
locked
briefcase
situation,
if
i
understood
you.
you
said
that
if
they
waited
thirty
days,
the
search
would
be
unreasonable.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
you
have
argued
mainly
there
is
no
change
in
the
privacy
interest,
but
focusing
on
the
possessory
interest
of
the
owner
of
the
container
for
the
moment,
would
there
be...
would
the
case
be
any
different,
in
your
view
if...
it
is
unlikely
on
these
facts
with
this
container...
but
if
the
owner
had
said
i
want
the
package
back
just
as
soon
as
possible
because
it
has
got
very
important
matter
that
i
want
to
use?
could
they
still
have
continued
to
sit
on
it
indefinitely?
justice
stevens
assume
it
was
a
locked
briefcase.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask--
--they
are
just
reeking
of
marijuana.
they
could...
just
reeking,
you
can
smell
them
that
well?
justice
stevens
i
want
to
go
back,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
an
automobile
search,
which
is
you
in
effect
making
an
alternate
ground
for
affirmance
by
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
point.
justice
stevens
and
you
say
that
it
was
not
an
automobile
search
in
part
because
there
was
no
evidence
found
anywhere
except
in
these
bales,
and
you
have
inferred
from
that
that
therefore
the
officers
did
not
in
fact
search
the
rest
of
the
camper.
but
how
do
we
know
that?
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
they
looked
at
the
rest
of
the
camper
or
not?
justice
stevens
but
even
if
they
didn't,
take
it
one
step
farther,
the
question
as
to
whether
ross
applies
or
not
i
suppose
turns
on
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
make
a
search
of
the
vehicle,
and
could
not
one
conclude
that
when
you
have
loaded
all
this
stuff
into
this
vehicle
and
the
vehicle
is
owned
by
the
same
group
of
people
who
own
the
contents,
that
there
is
probable
cause
that
would
justify
a
search
of
the
entire
vehicle?
justice
stevens
except
there
they
had
put
it
in
a
taxicab.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
the
taxicab
operator
is--
justice
stevens
--my
memory
may
be
faulty.
wasn't
that
a
taxicab?
justice
stevens
well,
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
the
cab
company
is
in
league
with
the
people
that
were--
justice
stevens
--well,
yes,
but...
all
right.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
the
subjective
motive
of
the
police
officer
making
it
rather
than
the
objective
facts
that
justify
the
action?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
is...
we
are
talking
about
ross
now,
and
the
question
is
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
make
a
vehicle
search.
justice
stevens
and
your
position
is
there
was
not
probable
cause
to
make
a
search
of
this
camper.
justice
stevens
my
understanding...
they
can
finish
the
job
they
have
already
started.
justice
stevens
no,
but
there
is
still
another
distinction.
it
is
not
just
that
they
are
in
a
vehicle
or
you
are
making
a
vehicle
search.
there
is
a
question
of
whether
you
have
a
right
to
make
a
vehicle
search.
there
was
no
right
to
make
a
vehicle
search
in
sanders
because
the
vehicle
itself
didn't...
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
believe
anything
would
be
found
in
the
vehicle
other
than
the
package.
and
your
argument
is
it
is
not
the
right
to
make
the
search
that
is
dispositive;
it
is
whether
the
officers
in
fact
engaged
in
the
search,
and
there
is
language
that
tends
to
suggest
that.
justice
stevens
well,
would
you
not
agree
that
at
least
analytically
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
distinction
between
a
right
to
make
a
vehicle
search
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
question
of
whether
you
are
actually
engaged
in
it
on
the
other?
justice
stevens
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
holding
on,
too.
justice
stevens
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
vehicle.
justice
stevens
this
is
really
an
exception
from
an
exception,
in
a
way,
because
if
they
are
within
the
automobile
exception,
which
you
of
course
disagree,
then
the
question
is
whether
they
got
out
of
it
by
waiting
too
long,
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
formulation
of
the
test
they
are
applying
of
"soon
thereafter".
they
don't
say
right
away,
they
say
soon
thereafter.
justice
stevens
and
you
would
agree
that
the
record
really
does
not
tell
us
when
they
tested
it.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals,
under
the
court
of
appeals'
rationale,
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
how
soon
it
was.
