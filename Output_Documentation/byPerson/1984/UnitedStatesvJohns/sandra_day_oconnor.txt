justice
o'connor
but
in
this
case
i
gather
you
agree
that
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
believe
it
was
marijuana,
and
in
fact
it
was
and
was
forfeitable.
so
under
those
circumstances
you
say
there
is
no
time
limit
in
any
event.
justice
o'connor
--okay.
were
the
vehicles
themselves
taken
into
custody,
seized?
justice
o'connor
by
the
officers.
justice
o'connor
the
entire
vehicle
with
the
contents.
justice
o'connor
mr.
walker,
do
you
think
the
police
could
have...
if
your
client
had
requested
the
return
of
the
bales,
that
the
police
would
have
to
give
back
the
marijuana
in
this
case
to
them,
ever?
justice
o'connor
it
was
forfeitable,
was
it
not?
justice
o'connor
it
was
contraband.
justice
o'connor
and
what
possible
interest
did
your
clients
have
in
the
contents
of
those
bales
that--
justice
o'connor
--that
you
think
can
be
asserted?
justice
o'connor
what's
wrong
with
that
argument?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
walker,
what...
what
about
a
package
that
is
wrapped
as
marijuana
bales
are
typically
wrapped,
experienced
officers
known
that,
it
looks
like
marijuana,
it
smells
like
marijuana,
and
n
fact,
it
is
marijuana?
now,
what
privacy
interest
do
you
have
in
it?
it
isn't
like
an
ordinary
package
that
someone
might
expect
to
have
a
privacy
interest
in.
i
think
your
argument
just
fails
to
reckon
with
the
facts
of
this
case.
justice
o'connor
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
container
is
worthy.
if
the
container
discloses
in
this
case,
by
virtue
of
the
smell
and
the
appearance,
its
contents.
justice
o'connor
mr.
walker,
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
your
interpretation
of
ross?
are
you
going
to
argue
that
the
three
days
or
four
days
or
whatever
it
was
makes
a
difference?
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
truck
had
just
been
kept
in
the
yard
at
the
police
station
for
three
days
with
the
packages
in
it,
and
then
it
was
opened
and
they
were
searched?
is
that
okay?
justice
o'connor
what
difference
could
it
possibly
make
that
the
packages
were
removed
and
searched
after
three
days?
justice
o'connor
in
what
sense
can
you
say
that
the
interests
of
your
client
suffer
more
in
one
case
than
the
other?
justice
o'connor
legitimate
expectation?
