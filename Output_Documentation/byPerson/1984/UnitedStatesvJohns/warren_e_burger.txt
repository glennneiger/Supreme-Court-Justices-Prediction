chief

e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
johns.
mr.
horowitz,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
is
it
your
view
that
if
they
could
have
opened
it
at
the
time,
on
the
scene,
right
after
it
was
seized,
that
they
could
open
it
one
hour
later,
one
day
later,
two
days
later,
ten
days
later?
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
that
once
the
court
of
appeals
conceded
that
it
could
have
been
opened
right
away,
that
was
the
end
of
the
case.
it
could
be
opened
any
time
thereafter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
walker?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
packages
could
have
been
opened
on
the
scene
right
at
the
time
they
were--
chief
justice
burger
let
me
see
what,
if
i
am
confused
about
the
facts.
how
did
these
packages
get
into
the
truck
from
the,
from
wherever
they
came?
chief
justice
burger
then
you
don't
agree
with
the
government's
version
of
the
facts,
that
they
came
in
this
isolated
airstrip
at
night
and
the
packages
were
taken
off
the
small
airplane
and
put
onto
the
truck.
do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
burger
and
you
agree
that
the
packages
came
off
the
airplane,
do
you?
chief
justice
burger
and
were
put
on--
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
must
agree,
i
would
think,
that
frequently
we
do
not
consider
a
principle
laid
down
as
confined
to
the
precise
facts
in
which...
in
the
case
in
which
they
were
laid
down.
the
ross
opinion
announced
a
general
principle,
did
it
not,
that
deviated
somewhat
from
prior
holdings?
chief
justice
burger
it
went
beyond
prior
holdings.
chief
justice
burger
but
if
it
happened
to
be
a
truck
instead
of
a
camper
or
a
taxicab
instead
of
a
truck,
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
would
it,
in
terms
of
the
principles
laid
down?
chief
justice
burger
but
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
would
have
been
perfectly
legal
and
proper
to
have
torn
the
packages
open
at
the
scene
on
the
bed
of
the
truck
or
whatever
you
want
to
describe
it,
and
take
it
out
for
testing.
chief
justice
burger
then
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
case,
would
there?
chief
justice
burger
what's
the...
i
will
put
to
you
the
question
that
your
friend
rhetorically
put,
how
you
have
been
damaged
by
waiting
a
day
or
two.
chief
justice
burger
well,
privacy
expectations
in
the
mail
or
in
interstate
commerce
are
quite
different
from
being...
from
packages
unloaded
from
a
small
airplane
at
an
isolated
airstrip
under
the
circumstances
shown
here.
chief
justice
burger
what
if
it
were
in
the
back
of
the
trunk
of
a
car
under
ross?
chief
justice
burger
you
say
it
must
be
completed
right
away
on
the
scene.
chief
justice
burger
but
then,
do
you
really
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
about
the
search
on
the
scene?
chief
justice
burger
how
about
a
forfeiture
proceeding?
do
you
think
it
would
be
required
before
they
did
the
burning?
chief
justice
burger
in
the
bales
of
marijuana?
society's
standard,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
it
had
two
locks
on
it
and
it
was
not
in
an
automobile.
chief
justice
burger
i
suppose
every
criminal
engaged
in
criminal
activity
hopes
that
he
is
going
to
have
a
lot
of
privacy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
horowitz?
chief
justice
burger
do
we
know
whether
this
truck
was
forfeited
after
the
event
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
resume
at
1:00
o'clock
in
the
next
case.
