mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
presented
concerns
the
authority
of
police
officers
to
open
bales
of
marijuana
wrapped
in
plastic
bags
and
found
in
a
vehicle.
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
the
lapse
of
time
that
occurred
from
the
discovery
of
the
packages
to
the
time
when
core
samples
were
taken
from
those
packages,
eliminated
the
officer's
prior
authority
to
open
the
packages
without
a
warrant
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause.
the
facts
may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows:
at
approximately
1:30
a.m.
on
august
4,
1981,
customs
officers
received
a
report
of
suspicious
activity
at
a
drag
strip
outside
tucson,
arizona.
a
car
leaving
the
site
was
intercepted
and
its
occupants
were
identified
as
respondents
johns
and
hearron.
pursuant
to
an
ongoing
investigation,
customs
officials
already
had
prior
information
linking
johns
with
respondents
leon
and
duarge
in
an
international
drug
smuggling
operation.
accordingly,
a
customs
officer
then
commenced
surveillance
at
leon's
and
duarte's
residences,
which
led
him
to
follow
their
two
pickup
trucks
as
they
headed
east
on
interstate
highway
10
in
arizona.
other
officers
were
contacted,
and
ground
and
air
surveillance
was
maintained
on
the
trucks
which
drove
about
100
miles
east
to
a
remote
airstrip
near
bowie,
arizona.
shortly
after
the
trucks
arrived,
the
first
of
two
small
planes
landed.
the
agents
on
the
ground
were
situated
too
far
away
to
see
what
transpired
there,
but
they
were
told
by
their
colleagues
in
the
air
that
one
of
the
trucks
approached
the
plane.
the
first
plane
then
departed,
and
a
second
plane
landed
and
subsequently
departed.
the
officers
then
approached
the
trucks
to
investigate.
when
they
got
close
to
them,
they
smelled
marijuana
and
saw
approximately
40
square
packages
wrapped
in
plastic,
exposed
in
the
back
of
the
trucks.
five
of
the
respondents
were
arrested
at
the
scene,
and
the
trucks
and
the
packages
were
transported
back
to
a
dea
warehouse
in
tucson.
sometime
thereafter,
three
days
later,
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
core
samples
were
taken
from
some
of
the
bales
and
sent
to
the
laboratory
for
analysis.
this
analysis
confirmed
that
they
were
in
fact
marijuana.
no
search
warrant
was
obtained.
the
district
court
suppressed
the
contraband,
finding
that
it
was
the
fruit
of
a
warrantless
search
that
was
prohibited
by
the
then
controlling
supreme
court
authority
in
robbins
v.
california.
the
government
appealed,
relying
primarily
on
footnote
13
in
arkansas
v.
sanders
and
contending
that
the
telltale
odor
and
the
nature
of
the
packaging
of
these
bales
made
the
contents
sufficiently
obvious
that
no
warrant
was
required.
while
the
case
was
pending
on
appeal,
this
court
decided
united
states
v.
ross,
and
the
parties
submitted
supplemental
memoranda
to
address
the
significance
of
that
decision.
the
government
claimed
that
ross
was
dispositive.
respondents
made
two
arguments.
first,
they
claimed
that
ross
should
not
be
applied
retroactively,
and
second,
they
contended
that
ross
did
not
apply
in
this
case
because
the
probable
cause
focused
on
the
packages
themselves,
not
on
the
trucks.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
both
of
these
arguments.
however,
it
found
for
respondents
on
a
ground
not
briefed
by
the
parties.
the
court
ruled
that
a
warrant
was
required
to
open
the
packages
after
the
three-day
delay,
even
though
one
would
not
have
been
required
had
the
search
been
conducted
immediately
at
the
scene
or
immediately
at
the
station
house.
the
court
denied
the
government's
petition
for
rehearing
and
the
government
petition
for
certiorari.
respondents
make
two
arguments
in
this
court.
first,
they
renew
their
claim
that
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals.
they
claim
that
ross
does
not
apply
here
because
the
probable
cause
focused
on
the
packages.
rather,
they
contend
that
this
case
is
analogous
to
united
states
v.
chadwick
and
therefore
that
the
police
always
needed
a
warrant
to
open
the
packages,
even
if
they
had
been
searched
immediately
at
the
scene
of
the
seizure
at
the
airstrip.
this
contention
is
somewhat
factbound.
it
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
addressed
in
detail
in
our
reply
brief,
and
i
do
not
plan
to
dwell
on
it
at
length
in
this
court.
let
me
just
say
briefly
that
the
agents'
observations
here
plainly
gave
them
probable
cause
to
search
the
trucks.
they
were
not
close
enough
to
see
anything
specific
that
happened
when
the
airplanes
landed.
what
they
did
know
was
that
persons
involved,
known
to
be
involved
in
a
drug
smuggling
operation
had
driven
two
trucks
and
met
two
airplanes
at
an
airstrip
and
apparently
had
received
something
from
the
airplanes.
they
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
contraband
had
been
transferred
to
the
trucks.
they
did
not
see
any
packages.
they
did
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
any
specific
kind
of
packages
until
they
approached
the
trucks.
when
they
did
approach
the
trucks
and
saw
the
packages
wrapped
in
plastic,
naturally
their
attention
focused
on
those
packages.
but
that
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
their
suspicion
from
the
beginning
was
focused
on
the
trucks
themselves,
not
on
the
packages.
this
case
in
respect
is
exactly
like
ross
and
completely
unlike
chadwick
and
arkansas
v.
sanders,
cases
in
which
the
police
had
suspicion
that
was
focused
on
particular
packages
or
containers
in
those
cases,
and
the
relationship...
excuse
me,
they
had
a
suspicion
even
before
the
packages
were
ever
placed
in
a
vehicle,
and
the
fact
that
they
were
later
placed
in
a
vehicle
before
the
seizure
was
quite
coincidental
to
the
nature
of
the
suspicion.
i
would
also
say
that
applying
ross
in
this
case
leads
to
the
only
sensible
result
here,
that
it
would
be
quite
unreasonable
to
have
required
the
police
to
get
a
warrant
at
the
scene
when
they...
in
order
to
take
core
samples
or
to
open
these
bales
that
were
reeking
of
marijuana
at
the
time.
if
there
are
no
questions
on
that
point,
i
will
turn
to
respondents'
second
contention,
which
is
the
focus
of
our
petition.
that
is,
assuming
that
ross
applies
here
and
that
the
police
could
have
searched
the
bales
at
the
scene
without
a
warrant,
respondents
argue
that
the
police
nonetheless
needed
a
warrant
when
they
opened
the
packages
at
the
station
a
few
days
later.
this
argument
that
this
delay
alone
created
a
warrant
requirement
is
completely
foreclosed
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
suppose
so,
but
for
different
reasons,
i
think,
but
yes,
at
some
point
anyway.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
respondents
have
the
burden.
i
mean,
there
is
a
search
here,
and
it
seems
to
be
valid
on
its
face.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
that
it
would
have...
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
it
found
the
delay
significant
in
this
case--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--right,
nobody
argued
it,
so
it
didn't
really
come
up.
i
think
what
they
probably
should
have
done
was
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
for
further
findings
on
it.
the
court
of
appeals'
view
i
take
it
was
that
the
exact
amount
of
the
delay
was
not
really
significant,
and
perhaps
even
if
it
had
been
a
day
later,
they
still
would
have
reached
the
same
holding.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
it
is
really
totally
unknown.
there
was
nothing
in
the
hearing
that
focused
on
it
at
all.
the
government
has...
we
have
no,
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
sooner
than
one
day,
certainly.
it
does
not
appear
that
it
was
done
immediately
upon
return
to
the
station.
the
other
thing
that
is
peculiar
about
this
case
is
that
this
isn't...
the
search
that
we
are
talking
about
is
not...
was
not
really...
its
purpose
was
not
an
evidentiary
search
in
the
way
that
usually
comes
up
in
these
cases.
the
police
were
pretty
sure
what
they
had.
they
were
smelling
marijuana.
they
had
40
bales
there.
they
were
packages
like
marijuana
is
always
packaged.
so
they
didn't...
they
weren't
all
that
curious
about
what
the
contents
were,
and
i
think
that
was--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes.
so
what
happened
was
in
preparation
for
further
judicial
proceedings
they
went
ahead
and
had
it
tested.
so
they
didn't
have
the
same
reason
to
go
ahead
and
do
it.
so
it
is
certainly
possible
that
they
might
not
have
done
it
until
a
couple
of
days
later,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that
is
essentially
our
view.
at
some
point
you
might
start
to
run
into
other
kinds
of
considerations
such
as
their
possessory
interest
in
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
we
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
compel
a
conclusion.
i
am
not
sure
i
really
answered
justice
stevens'
question
about
whether,
the
fact
that
we
don't
really
know
the
state
of
the
record
on
this
is
dispositive
of
the
case.
i
mean,
the
government
did
petition
for
a
hearing
on
this
issue,
and
the
court
of
appeals
just
did
not
seem
concerned
about
exactly
how
long
the
delay
was
on
it.
i
think
it
is
clear,
it
is
fairly
clear
that
they
did
not
open
the
packages
as
soon
as
they
could.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
the
duty
to
execute
a
warrant
within
some
time
is
either
because
it
is
specified
on
the
face
of
the
warrant,
and
usually
it
is
because
the
information
that
gives
probable
cause
may
become
stale
at
some
time,
which
is
not
really
the
case
here.
so
i
was
really
speaking
generally
there,
justice
rehnquist,
and
the
particular
facts
here
where
you
have,
or
what
the
agents
had
was
forfeitable
contraband
that
there
was,
that
they
had
no
right
to
return--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
it
was.
there
was
no
request
for
return.
so
i
don't
think
it
was
any
possessory
interest
that
was
implicated
here,
and
there
was
no
way
that
the
probable
cause
is
going
to
dissipate.
i
am
not
sure
that
there
really
was
an
outer
limit.
i
mean,
i
don't--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
we
haven't
really
litigated
that
here.
i
guess
there
would
be
an
argument
under
jacobsen
that
it
was
not
a
search
at
all.
they
weren't
going
to
find
out--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it
was
a
field
test
but
i
think
they
had
to
remove
some--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
my...
i
mean,
they
had
to
open
the
packages
in
order
to
do
that,
so
there
is
some
sense
in
which
there
was
a
search
of
a
container,
a
technical
sense,
but
the
actual
test
that
they
performed
on
it
i
don't
think
was
a
search.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
this
court.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
well,
we
have
not--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
but
as
far
as
the
question
of
whether
there
was
an
outer
limit
on
how
long
it
could
have
taken
to
search,
i
think
that
is
something
that
does
depend
on
the
nature
of
what
they
had.
if
there
was
a
locked
briefcase,
i
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
not
to
search
it
for
a
month,
just
hold
it
for
a
month
without
turning
it
over.
but
in
this
case
i
am
not
sure
it
would
be.
but
given
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case,
i
mean,
we
had
this
decision
on
the
books.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
length
of
time
is
really
very
important.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
that's
our
view,
but
i
think
the
respondents'
view
and
the
court
of
appeals'
view
is
that
as
soon
as
you
get
past
the
time
when
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant,
the
length
of
time
doesn't
matter,
and
a
much
shorter
time
is
good
enough
to
grant
a
suppression
motion
in
this
case.
that
is
the
legal
principle
we
have
a
problem
with,
and
that
is
why
we
are
petitioning
here.
so
from
the
perspective
of
the
decision
below,
i
don't
think
it
matters
at
that
point.
in
our
view,
the
contention
that
the
delay
here
by
itself
created
a
warrant
requirement
is
foreclosed
by
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
the
respondents
did
not
dispute
here
at
all
that
the
police
could
have
searched
the
trucks
themselves
even
three
days
later.
that
principle
is
established
by
a
long
line
of
positions
here,
beginning
with
chambers
v.
maroney,
continuing
through
texas
v.
white
and
michigan
v.
thomas,
and
in
fact,
last
term,
in
florida
v.
meyers,
all
nine
justices
of
this
court
characterized
that
proposition
as
well
settled.
what
respondents
do
argue
here
is
that
at
some
point
during
the
time
that
the
packages
were
at
the
stationhouse,
a
point
that
they
define
somewhat
imprecisely
as
the
time
limit
became
practicable
to
get
a
warrant,
the
packages
themselves
became
analytically
distinct
from
the
trucks
on
which
they
were
found,
and
they
could
at
that
point
no
longer
be
searched
without
a
warrant.
this
argument
is
completely
contrary
to
ross
on
two
separate
points.
first,
the
basis
for
the
decision
in
ross
is
that
the
authority
to
conduct
an
automobile
search
extends
to
the
entire
automobile,
including
its
contents,
which
includes
the
packages
found
inside.
that
is
to
say,
the
search
of
a
package
found
in
an
automobile
is
part
of
the
automobile
search
itself.
it
is
not
distinct
at
all.
just
as
the
justification
for
the
automobile
search,
that
is
to
say,
probable
cause,
continues
to
authorize
a
warrantless
search
of
the
vehicle
after
it
has
been
impounded
at
the
station,
so
does
that
justification
authorize
the
search
of
a
package
at
that
time
as
part
of
that
vehicle
search.
second,
ross
clearly
confirms
that
the
validity
of
a
warrantless
automobile
search
does
not
depend
on
any
special
exigency.
indeed,
if
it
did,
the
packages
and
the
trucks
in
this
case
probably
could
not
have
been
searched
without
a
warrant
even
at
the
scene
since
the
respondents
had
been
arrested
and
the
trucks
had
been
secured.
certainly
if
respondents
were
correct
on
this
point,
the
trucks
and
the
packages
could
not
have
been
searched
once
they
had
been
taken
to
dea
headquarters,
even
if
that
search
had
been
conducted
quite
promptly
there.
these
courts'
case
from
chambers
through
florida
v.
meyers,
however,
make
it
clear
that
the
trucks
in
fact
could
have
been
searched
at
the
stationhouse,
even
after
some
time
had
elapsed.
thus,
respondents'
contention--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
still
think
there
is
no
fourth
amendment
violation
there
unless
something
is
shown
as
to
what
problem
there
was
in
waiting
a
for
a
month,
either
that
the
probable
cause
should
have
dissipated
or
that
the
question
that
came
up
in
the
segura
case
here,
whether
there
was
some
interference
with
some
right
of
the
defendant,
possessory
interest.
i
mean,
here
they
didn't
ask
for
these
things
back.
they
didn't
have
any
right
to
get
them
back.
they
were
contraband.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
trucks
were
forfeitable,
too,
sure.
i
think
that
is
clear
from
the
court's
decisions.
the
court
has
said
that
even
though
the
exigency
has
been
removed
at
the
stationhouse,
the
search
is
still
allowed
to
be
performed
without
a
warrant,
and
at
that
point
i
don't
think
it
matters
whether
it
is
eight
hours
or
a
day
or
even
a
month,
at
least
as
far
as
those
principles
go.
but
the
contention
that
the
exigency
here,
the
question
of
exigency,
when
it
became
practical
to
get
a
warrant,
is
sharply
at
odds
with
ross.
this
case,
as
recognized
in
ross
and
discussed
in
other
automobile
search
cases
in
this
court,
involves
a
recognized
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement,
an
exception
that
is
distinct
from
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine.
when
probable
cause
exists
to
search
an
automobile
and
its
contents
seized
on
the
highway,
the
practicability
of
obtaining
a
warrant
at
some
time
after
the
seizure
is
not
a
relevant
consideration.
now,
putting
aside
for
the
moment
the
dispositive
precedent
on
this
point,
there
is
still
no
reason,
no
common
sense
reason
why
the
delay
should
have
any
effect
on
the
ability
to
conduct
a
warrantless
search.
as
the
court
explained
in
ross,
the
scope
of
an
automobile
search
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
scope
of
a
search
that
could
be
authorized
by
a
magistrate
through
a
search
warrant.
reading
from
page
823
of
ross,
the
court
said
the
scope
of
a
warrantless
search
based
on
probable
cause
is
no
narrower
and
no
broader
than
the
scope
of
a
search
authorized
by
a
warrant
supported
by
probable
cause.
only
the
prior
approval
of
the
magistrate
is
waived.
the
search
otherwise
is
as
the
magistrate
could
authorize.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
this
is
ross
at
page
823.
if
the
officers
had
obtained
a
search
warrant
for
the
trucks
at
the
time
that
they
seized
them,
there
surely
is
no
contention
that
the
trucks
and
the
packages
could
not
have
been
searched
later
at
the
stationhouse,
even
three
days
later.
there
is
no
reason
why
there
should
be
a
different
result
here.
certainly
policy
considerations
lend
no
support
to
the
court
of
appeals'
holding.
the
decision
below
does
not
advance
any
privacy
interest
of
the
individual
at
all.
the
privacy
intrusion
to
him
is
the
same
whether
the
packages
are
searched
immediately
or
whether
they
are
searched
three
days
later.
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy
of
the
individual
that
is
intruded
by
the
warrantless
search
here.
it
cannot
seriously
be
contended
that
the
delay
itself
created
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
package
that
did
not
exist
previously
and
that
could
not
be
invaded
without
obtaining
a
search
warrant
from
a
magistrate.
under
ross,
the
placement
of
a
package
in
an
automobile
sufficiently
reduces
his
expectation
of
privacy
that
it
may
be
searched
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
without
a
warrant.
that
expectation
of
privacy
cannot
magically
reappear
with
the
passage
of
some
indefinite
period
of
time
while
the
package
at
all
times
remains
in
the
custody
of
the
police.
the
practical
effect
of
the
rule
imposed
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
simply
to
induce
the
police
to
make
an
immediate
search.
that
does
not
help
the
individual's
privacy
interest
at
all,
but
it
does
put
an
unnecessary
strain
on
law
enforcement
resources
with
some
potential
cost
to
their
other
responsibilities.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals'
rule
completely
eviscerates
this
court's
effort
in
ross
to
establish
a
bright
line
to
guide
officers
in
conducting
automobile
searches.
each
case,
under
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
where
the
search
was
not
made
at
the
scene,
would
result
in
litigation
over
when
it
became
practicable
to
get
a
warrant,
or
alternatively,
whether
the
delay
was
justified
by
"pressing
law
enforcement
duties",
a
phrase
like
that
used
by
respondents.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
even
the
respondents
haven'
t
contended
that.
they
say
that
there
could
be
a
delay
of
a
few
hours.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
there
could
be
a
line
drawn
there.
that's
the
line
that
the
court
refused
to
draw
in
chambers
v.
maroney
and
the
line
of
cases
thereafter.
there
really
isn't
any
reason
why
the
packages
should
be
treated
differently
than
the
car.
the
court
could
have
held
in
chambers
that
the
search
had
to
be
conducted
at
the
scene,
and
once
the
car
is
taken
to
the
stationhouse
a
warrant
was
required.
it
decided
for
good
reasons
there
that
there
was
no
point
in
having
such
a
rule.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
it
would
inventory
search
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
if
they
had
opened
the
packages?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
if
they
had
opened
the
packages.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
they
could
have
done
that
in
less
than
three
days.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
i
don't
think
they
could
have?
if
he
had
asserted
there
was
an
important
matter
in
there
that
he
was
entitled
to,
not
that
he
needed
the
marijuana
to
distribute
it,
but
something
that
was
not
forfeitable--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
absolutely.
at
some...
at
that
point
the
police
would
have
an
obligation
to
conduct
the
search
in
some
expeditious
manner.
i
still
think
they
could
delay
it
for
a
few
hours
if
they
had
other
duties
that
they
were
forced
to
attend
to,
but
at
least
there
there
is
a
reason,
and
there
is
some
deprivation.
now,
i
am
not
sure
what
the
remedy
would
be.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
i
completely
agree.
they
are
under
an
obligation
there
to
find
out
whether
there
is
in
fact
marijuana
in
there
or
whether
it
is
just
cotton.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
can't
conceive
of
anything
in
the
facts
of
this
case
where
the
defendants
would
be
prejudiced
at
all
by...
i
mean,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
police
are
not
going
to
keep
these
things
around
indefinitely.
they
have
an
interest
in
getting
things
moving.
but
i
don't
see
what
reason
they
would
have
to
complain
about
it,
even
if
the
search
had
taken
longer.
it
could
have
been
longer.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
inject
uncertainty
into
what
is
at
least
at
this
point
a
fairly
well
settled
area
of
the
law.
there
is
no
problem
here
that
requires
correction.
there
is
no
interest
here
that
requires
a
special
rule
to
protect
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
police
have
no
incentive
unnecessarily
to
delay
opening
the
packages
that
are
found
in
an
automobile
when
they
want
to
search
them
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause.
even
acting
without
any
fear
at
all
at
the
invocation
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
the
police's
desire
to
advance
the
course
of
its
investigation
suggests
that
officers
will
search
such
packages
as
soon
as
practicable.
therefore,
there
is
no
need
to
create
a
rule
to
prevent
officers
from
delaying.
secondly,
to
the
extent
there
is
any
delay...
and
that
is
really
illustrated
in
this
case...
it
a
does
not
really
prejudice
the
owners
of
the
packages
in
the
absence
of
some
other
set
of
facts
like
the
locked
briefcase
that
we
have
been
discussing.
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
here
that
even
though
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
police
needed
to
get
a
warrant
or
not,
this
is
not
really
like
the
normal
warrant
case
where
there
is
a
concern
of
protecting
the
individual's
privacy.
normally
in
a
case
where
the
court
imposes
a
warrant
requirement,
the
reason
is
to
interpose
the
magistrate
in
between
so
that
the
police's
own
determination
of
probable
cause
is
not
a
justification
for
search.
therefore,
in
a
case
where
the
police
turn
out
to
be
wrong,
there
is
a
real
privacy
intrusion
in
that
something
is
searched
for
no
reason.
but
that
is
not
the
case
here
because
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed,
the
police
are
still
entitled
to
conduct
a
warrantless
search
here.
it
does
not
protect
against
the
danger
that
the
police
are
going
to
misapprehend
the
nature
of
probable
cause.
the
only
thing
that
is
gained
by
applying
the
court
of
appeals'
rationale
is
that
the
police
will
be
prevented
from
delaying,
and
as
i
said
before,
that
delay
does
not
hurt
the
defendants,
and
there
is
no
incentive
for
the
police
to
do
it
anyway.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
let
me
just
make
a
brief
point
about
this
question
of
whether
the
trucks
were
searched.
we
agree
with
justice
stevens
that
the
crucial
issue
here
is
the
probable
cause
to
search
the
trucks,
not
the
subjective
motivation
of
the
officers.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
here,
i
think
the
trucks
were
searched.
it
is
just
that
these
bales
were
sitting
open
in
the
back
of
the
trucks.
so
it
didn't
have
to
be
very
extensive
search.
they
came
up
to
search
the
trucks,
and
right
away
they
saw
the
packages
there.
it
is
exactly
the
same
case
as
ross.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
in
ross
that
the
police
ripped
the
car
apart
after
they
found
the
paper
bag.
once
they
found
the
package,
they
thought
they
found
what
they
were
looking
for,
and
they
didn't
continue
the
search
there.
i
think
it
is
irrelevant
whether
the
trucks
were
searched
later
at
the
station,
but
there
is
no
evidence...
we
don't
really
know
from
the
record
whether
they
were
or
they
weren't.
the
only
evidence
that
i
found,
actually,
very
obliquely
suggests
that
they
were
in
fact
searched.
that
is
at
page
11
of
the
november
10
transcript.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
assume
that
it
was,
but
i
don't
know.
and
finally,
if
the
court
is
disposed
to
accept
this
argument
that
ross
does
not
apply
here
at
all,
we
would
suggest
that
a
warrantless
search
was
nevertheless
permissible
under
the
theory
of
footnote
13
of
sanders.
thank
you.
