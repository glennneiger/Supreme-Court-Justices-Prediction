justice
o'connor
ms.
corwin,
may
i
just
interrupt
a
moment
to
ask
you
whether
you
think
the
plaintiff
in
this
suit
had
a
burden
of
proving
that
the
impermissible
considerations
were
a
substantial
factor
in
the
decision,
or
is
it
a
"but
for"
causation
test?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
van
hoy,
i
thought
you
had
just
been
discussing
how
the
court
applied
a
closer
scrutiny,
if
you
will,
here
than
in
the
normal,
case.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
have
a
little
difficulty
seeing
how
if
that's
what
the
court
did,
it
was
at
the
same
time
following
a
normal
rule
52(a)
type
review.
