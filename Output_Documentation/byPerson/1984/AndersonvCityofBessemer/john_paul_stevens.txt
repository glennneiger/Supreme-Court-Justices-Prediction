justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
the
practice
of
a
district
judge
asking
prevailing
counsel
to
prepare
proposed
findings
of
fact?
do
you
think
that's
an
improper
or
proper
practice?
justice
stevens
is
this
judge's
practice
where
he
let's
one...
the
prevailing
party
submit
proposed
findings,
gives
the
losing
party
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
proposed
submission
by
the
prevailing
party?
justice
stevens
well,
if
that
practice
is
followed
where
the
prevailing
party
submits
those
that
he
thinks
are
appropriate,
and
then
the
other
side
has
a
chance
to
criticize
them
so
that
you
find
out
where
the
real
dispute
is,
what's
wrong
with
that...
that
procedure?
justice
stevens
well,
finish
your
response.
justice
stevens
well,
that's--
justice
stevens
mr.
van
hoy,
are
there
any
legal
issues
in
the
case?
did
the
district
judge
commit
any
errors
of
law?
