justice
rehnquist
mr.
wallas,
would
it
be
accurate
to
describe
bessemer
city
as
a
suburb
of
gastonia?
justice
rehnquist
but
not
really
a
suburb.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wallas,
what
is
this
court's
standard
of
review
in
a
case
such
as
you've
brought?
do
we
simply
sit
in
exactly
the
same
capacity
as
did
the
fourth
circuit
to
decide
whether
the
district
court's
findings
were
totally
erroneous,
or
do
we
defer
at
all
to
the
conclusions
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
that
respect?
justice
rehnquist
then
we
really
have
to
review
the
entire
record.
justice
rehnquist
ms.
corwin,
you
used
the
word
"most
qualified"
a
moment
ago.
i
suppose
if
the
district
court
is
going
to
find
that
one
applicant
or
the
other
is
more
qualified,
the
district
court
has
to
accept
the
employer's
definition
of
qualification,
doesn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
is
it
always
easy...
that
easy
to
break
it
down?
i
mean
if
the
selection
committee
isn't
given
any
standards,
can't
the
definition
of
qualification
evolve
while
they're
considering
the
position?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
right,
what's
the
remedy
that
is
shown
to
be
equally
qualified
but
not
better
qualified?
do
you
send
them
back
and
have
somebody
draw
straws?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
van
hoy,
i
don't
know
whether
the
chief
justice
is
waiting
to
ask
you--
--no.
i
wanted
to
ask
you
one
in
that
event.
i
take
it
we're
dealing
with
a
busy
district
court
judge,
and
he
hears
a
case
on
september
13th
and
14th,
1982.
when
he
leaves
the
bench,
he
says
nothing.
two
days
later
he
obviously
has
dictated
a
memorandum
based
on
his
recollection
of
the
evidence
without
any
chance
to
review
a
reporter's
transcript,
and
sets
forth
in
fairly
general
terms
his
impression
of
the
case,
says
here's
how
i'm
going
to
decide
it.
the
prevailing
party
should
present
amplified
findings.
the
prevailing
party
then
presents
amplified
findings
at
great
length.
you
have
an
opportunity
to
dispute
them,
and
the
judge
makes
a
few
changes.
now,
i
don't
know
how
district
courts
can
function
in
a
better
way
than
that.
what
is
it
that
strikes
you
so
unreasonable
about
that?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
then...
then
both
parties
are
put
to
a
tremendous
amount
of
work
in
proposing
sets
of
findings,
only
one
of
which
will...
will
be
used.
and
i
would
think
judge
mcmillan's
system
has
the
advantage
of
without
any
further
input
from
the
parties
at
all,
just
on
the
basis
of
his
own
recollection
of
the
testimony,
he
says
here
is
who
i
believe,
and
here's
how
i'm
going
to
come
down.
i...
i
think
it
would
be
in
a
way
hard
to
improve
on
that.
and
even
if...
even
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
it,
would
you
think
the
remedy
in
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
an
enhanced
examination
of
the
record,
or
should
they
just
say
well,
you
ought
to
start
over,
judge?
because
here,
as...
as
i
get
it,
they
used
this...
this
submission
business
as
an
excuse
to
give
a
closer
look
at
the
facts.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
isn't
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
really
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
entitled
to
exercise
a
different
standard
of
review
when
the
findings
have
been
prepared
by
the
party?
