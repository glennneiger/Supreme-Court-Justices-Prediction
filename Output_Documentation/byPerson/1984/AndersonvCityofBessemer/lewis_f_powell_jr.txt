justice
jr.
mr.
wallas,
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case,
i
suppose,
is
which
of
these
two
were
better
qualified
for
the
job.
are
you
familiar
with
appendix
b
in
respondent's
brief?
justice
jr.
is
that
a
fair
summary
of
the
qualifications
of
the
two
applicants?
justice
jr.
would
you
address
that
briefly?
justice
jr.
in
the
opinion
in
this
case?
justice
jr.
of
which
court?
justice
jr.
right.
the
district
court.
justice
jr.
right.
but
it
would
help
me
if
you
identified
by
number
which
of
the
findings
in
appendix
b
with
respect
to
these...
to
these
respective
qualifications
you
think
appendix
b
is
erroneous.
justice
jr.
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
and
the
court's
time,
but
do...
are
you
able
by
numbers
to
say
that--
justice
jr.
--three,
five
and
seven
are
erroneous?
justice
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
is
the
burden
on
petitioner
in
a
case
like
this...
not
the
petitioner
but
the
plaintiff...
in
a
case
like
this
to
show
that
he
or
she
is
better
qualified
or
is
it
sufficient
if
in
this
case,
for
example,
anderson
had
proved
when
the
burden
reverted
to
her
under
mcdonnell
douglas
to
show
that
she
was
equally
well
qualified?
justice
jr.
but
the
burden...
the
burden
always,
the
burden
of
ultimate
proof,
was
on
the
plaintiff,
of
course.
justice
jr.
when
the
employer
produced
evidence
that
at
least
arguably
rebutted
the
initial
prima
facie
presumption,
was
the
burden
on
the
defendant...
on
the
plaintiff
that
she
was
better
qualified
or
equally
qualified?
justice
jr.
so
you're...
you're
saying
that
the
evidence
here
shows
that
the
respondent,
the
defendant
in
the
case
advanced
only
pretextual
reasons?
justice
jr.
yes.
i
understand
that.
but
do
you
think
that
could
not
be
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
jr.
the
subsidiary
findings
with
respect
to
qualifications
were
all
objective
in
a
sense,
weren't
they?
justice
jr.
objective
in
terms
of
experience,
the
education
of
the
respective
candidates.
