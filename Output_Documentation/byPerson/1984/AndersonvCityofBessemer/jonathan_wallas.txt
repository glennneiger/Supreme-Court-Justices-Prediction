mr.
jonathan
wallas
this
is
fine,
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you;
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
application
of
rule
52(a)
when
it
concluded
that
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact,
including
the
ultimate
finding
of
sex
discrimination,
were
without
evidentiary
support.
the
facts
of
this
case
can
be
briefly
stated
as
follows.
in
march
1975
the
job
of
recreation
director
became
vacant...
became
vacant
in
the
city
of
bessemer
city.
eight
applicants
for
the
job
were
interviewed
by
a
five-person
committee.
the
committee
consisted
of
four
men
and
one
woman.
prior
to
selection,
no
job
duties,
selection
guidelines
or
criteria
for
selection,
written
or
otherwise,
were
provided
to
or
promulgated
by
the
selection
committee,
except
the
requirement
that
the
successful
applicant
live
in
bessemer
city
or
be
willing
to
relocate
there.
although
no
job
description
was
provided
to
the
selection
committee,
the
committee
unanimously
agreed
that
the
recreation
director's
job
was
to
develop
a
diverse
program
of
recreation
activities
for
all
ages
and
sexes
in
the
community.
the
unanimous
first
choice
of
the
committee
for
the
job
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
burt
broadway,
but
mr.
broadway
was
not
willing
to
relocate
to
bessemer
city,
and
he
was
not
formally
offered
the
position.
the
committee
found
two
other
applicants
well
qualified
for
the
position...
donald
kincaid
and
phyllis
anderson.
kincaid
was
selected
by
a
4
to
1
vote.
the
four
male
members
of
the
committee
voted
for
mr.
kincaid;
the
one
female
member
of
the
committee
voted
for
ms.
anderson.
at
trial
the
parties
presented
conflicting
evidence
about
a
number
of
material
facts,
especially
about
the
motivation
of
the
selection
committee.
the
district
court,
citing
and
following
a
law
established
by
this
court
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
case
and
the
burdine
case,
a
legal
analysis
that
has
not
been
challenged
by
the
respondent
and
which
was
not
criticized
by
the
fourth
circuit,
found
that
the
city's
sole
articulation
that
kincaid
was
selected,
because
he
had
a
college
degree
in
physical
education,
was
pretextual.
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
the
male
committee
members
voted
for
mr.
kincaid
because
he
was
a
male,
and
that
but
for
discrimination
based
on
sex,
the
plaintiff
would
have
been
selected
for
the
position.
the
city
appealed,
contending
that
the
court's
findings
of
fact
were
clearly
erroneous
under
rule
52(a).
the
fourth
circuit,
largely
adopting
the
city's
analysis
of
the
evidence,
reversed.
we
contend
that
the
district
court
correctly
assumed
and
applied
its
responsibilities
and
finding
of
facts,
including
the
issue
of
discriminatory
motivation,
as
explicitly
required
by
this
court's
decisions
in
swint
and
aikens,
and
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
conversely,
we
contend
that
the
fourth
circuit
strayed
from
its
proper
role
under
rule
52
as
an
appellate
court
and
that
it
wore
blinders
which
prevented
it
from
discovering
the
ample
evidence
which
in
fact
supports
the
district
court's
findings;
it
selectively
cited
only
those
portions
of
the
record
which
supported
the
facts
found
by
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
de
novo
basis,
even
going
so
far
in
footnote
4
to
its
opinion
to
excise
a
portion
of
mrs.
boone's
testimony
about
the
relative
qualifications
of
ms.
kincaid
and
mr.
anderson,
thereby
misrepresenting
the
substance
of
ms.
boone's
testimony.
it
adopted
a
working
wife
defense,
contrary
to
reason
and
law,
which
was
then
utilized
to
rebut
the
substantial
evidence
of
bias
found
by
the
district
court.
i
would
now
like
to
discuss
the
evidence
of
discrimination
found
by
the
district
court,
evidence
of
such
quantity
and
quality
and
with
such
support
in
the
record
that
we
contend
strongly
calls
for
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
with
instructions
to
reinstate
the
district
court's
verdict.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
a
suburb
of
gastonia.
it's
a
small,
independent
town
fairly
close
to
gastonia.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
that's
correct.
the
district
court
found
discrimination
based
on
six
separate
subsidiary
findings
of
fact.
first,
the
district
court
found
that
mr.
nichols,
one
of
the
male
committee
members,
made
direct
statements
indicating
his
bias
against
selecting
a
woman
for
the
position.
mr.
nichols
stated,
"it
would
have
been
real
hard
for
a
lady
to
do
the
job.
"
"i
wouldn't
want
my
wife
to
have
it.
"
"i
have
three
children
at
home,
and
i
think
my
wife
should
be
at
home.
"
the
district
court
found
that
these
statements
provided
direct
evidence
of
nichols'
illegal
motivation.
second,
the
district
court
found
that
committee
member
butler
actively
solicited
four
men
for
the
position,
including
the
successful
candidate,
mr.
kincaid,
and
mr.
broadway.
he
further
testified
that
he
knew
12...
excuse
me...
knew
two
well-qualified
women
who
he
would
have
voted
for
for
the
position,
but
he
had
not
actively
solicited
their
applications.
third,
the
district
court
found
that
the
committee
had
manipulated
the
selection
criterion.
when
it
first
emphasized
experience
when
experiencing
mr.
broadway,
who
had
no
college
degree,
and
then
emphasized
the
particular
degree
that
mr.
kincaid
had,
a
degree
in
physical
education,
when
it
selected
him.
it
thus
ignored
the
petitioner's
combination
of
education
and
experience,
including
her
diverse
work
experience
and
previous
work
in
recreation,
as
well
as
her
leadership
experience,
her
experience
gained...
that
leadership
experience
was
gained
working
with
various
civic
groups,
her
job-related
experience
working
with
schoolchildren
and
her
various
other
job
positions.
fourth,
the
district
court
found
the
petitioner
and
only
petitioner
was
asked
certain
questions,
which
because
they
were
only
asked
of
a
female
candidate
for
the
job,
implied
substantial
doubt
that
a
woman
should
have
a
job
which
required
night
work,
and
which
implied
a
sexually
stereotypical
attitude
that
a
woman
ought
to
be
home
at
night
instead
of
working.
the
plaintiff
had
in
this
case--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice;
may
it
please
the
court:
prior
to
the
lunch
break
i
was
discussing
the
fourth
separate
finding
of
discrimination
found
by
the
district
court
concerning
certain
questions
that
the
district
court
found
were
asked
only
of
the
female
applicants...
of
the
female
applicant
for
the
recreation
director
job.
the
plaintiff
had
in
this
case
what
the
aikens
case
acknowledges
as
rare:
an
eyewitness...
that
is,
ms.
boone...
who
testified
about
the
interviews.
the
district
court
found
that
petitioner
and
only
petitioner
was
asked
how
my
husband
felt
about
me
applying
for
the
job;
if
she
realized
that
there
was
night
work
involved;
and
if
she
realized
that
there
would
be
travel
involved
in
the
job.
there
was
no
evidence
that
anyone
but
ms.
anderson
was
asked
a
question
about
her
spouse's
reaction
to
seeking
the
job,
or
about
travel.
there
was
conflicting
evidence
about
whether
other
applicants
were
asked
about
night
work...
a
factual
dispute
which
the
district
court
resolved
in
ms.
anderson's
favor.
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
defendant
admitted
in
the
post-trial
arguments...
immediately
after
the
trial
there
were
arguments
to
the
court
by
counsel...
that
whether
these
questions
were
asked
of
all
of
the
candidates
was
a
credibility
issue.
and
that
appears
at
page
176a
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
smack
of
title
vii...
of
a
title
vii
violation
to
ask
that
question
only
of
women
who
applied
for
a
job.
it...
it
would
imply
that
the
women
had
the
sole
responsibility
for
raising
the
children,
that
men
don't
also
have
some
responsibility
for
that.
and
it--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
--well,
i'm
not
sure
we
have
to
reach
constitutionality.
we're
talking
about
the
title
vii
statute,
and
i
think
that
if,
as
here,
a
district
court
used
that
piece
of
evidence
with
as
much
other
evidence
as
was
used
by
this
district
court
to
make
a
finding
with
respect
to
motivation,
as
this
district
court
did,
that
that
would
be
certainly
within
the
province
of
the
district
court.
in
the
aikens
decision...
i
believe
it's
the
footnote
2...
justice
rehnquist,
as
i
recall,
discussed
some
type
of
evidence
which
apparently
was
forecast
by
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
and
said
if
the
plaintiff
were
able
to
show
this,
and
if
the
court
found
these
particular
facts,
which
were
not
exactly
the
same
as
was
shown
in
this
case,
but
similar
type
evidence
of
discrimination,
that
that
would...
and
the
district
court
found
motivation
and
found
discrimination,
that
that
would
not
be
reversed.
and
i
think...
i
think
this
is
just
one
of
the...
of
the
legs
that...
upon
which
the
finding
was
based.
in
addition,
the
district
court
found,
fifth,
that
two
committee
members,
butler
and
nichols,
had
solicited
kincaid
to
apply
for
the
job,
and
they
referred
to
the
job
as
athletic
director,
thereby
improperly
emphasizing
the
traditional
male
athletic
component
of
the
position.
sixth,
the
district
court
found
that
no
credit
was
given
to
the
plaintiff
for
the
detailed
recreational
program
she
advanced
or
the
fact
that
she
possessed
a
recreation
supervision
certificate
obtained
as
a
result
of
her
previous
experience
in
recreation
supervision...
a
certificate
which
mr.
kincaid
did
not
possess.
we
contend
this
body
of
evidence,
these
six
examples
or
six
findings
of
the
district
court
of
disparate
treatment,
both
direct
and
circumstantial
evidence,
was
more
than
sufficient
under
such
cases
of
this
court
as
the
arlington
heights
case
to
permit
the
finding
in
favor
of
petitioner.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
the
primary
role
of
this
court
would
be
to
do
basically
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
do:
to
look
at
the
evidence
found
by
the
district
court.
and
if
there
is
evidence
to
support
that,
then
unless
that
evidence
is
clearly
outweighed
by
other
evidence
of
record,
then
you
should
reinstate
the
district
court's
verdict.
i
think
in
addition,
as
i
pointed
out,
you
should
take
a
very
close
look
at
what
we
say
were
the
de
novo
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
justification
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
their
decision.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
you
do,
your
honor.
you
do,
because
there's
no
way
for
you
to,
i
think,
to
properly
decide
this
case
without
looking
at
what
the
district
court
found
and
looking
at
what
the
court
of
appeals
found.
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
has
to
be
done
under
the
circumstances.
what,
of
course,
i
think
this
court
has
been
trying
to
do,
and
i'm
sure
will
hopefully
try
to
do
in
this
case,
is
try
to
again
send
a
message
to
the
lower
courts
about
the
proper
role
of...
of
an
appellate
court
under
rule
52
and
the
proper
role
of
a
district
court.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
yes,
sir.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
no,
sir.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
yes,
sir.
i
think
a
fair
summary
of
the
qualifications
of
the
two
applicants
is
contained
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
who
addressed
the
question
of
qualifications.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
of...
of
the
district
court.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
yes,
sir.
and
that's...
i
believe
that
appears
in
the
petition
at
pages
15a
through
19a.
and
what
the
district
court
did
in--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
--i
think
the
way...
your
honor,
i
can
go
through
these
if
you
would
like.
i
had
not--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
--not
without
reading--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
--not
without
reading
through
this
entire
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
our
opinion
would
be
that
under...
as
i...
as
i
read
your
decision
in
the
burdine
case,
your
honor,
that...
that
if
two
candidates
are
equally
qualified,
that
the
employer
can
take
either
one,
but
it
can't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex.
and
the
point
of
this
case
is
that
the
only
reason,
the
only
articulation
in
burdine
terms
that
was
advanced
by
the
city
was
that
mr.
kincaid
had
a
degree
in
p.e.
they
really
didn't
discuss
the
overall
qualifications
of
the
candidates,
and
that's
why
i
was
referring
the
court
to
what
the
district
court
did.
what
the
district
court
did
was
look
at
the
job
duties,
because...
because
the...
the...
you
need
to
recall
that
the
city
had
not
established
any
criteria
for
the
job
prior
to
selection.
it
looked
at
the
job
duties
and
then
juxtaposed
the
qualifications
of
the
two
candidates.
so
to
answer
your
question,
i
think
that
if
discrimination
is
shown,
and
if
the
sole
articulation
advanced
by
the
employer
is
rebutted
and
shown
to
be
pretextual,
then
the
plaintiff
wins.
and
in
that
situation
if
the
plaintiff
was...
you've
got
a
problem
with
look
what's
meant
by
qualifications
and--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
--yes,
sir.
that's
what
the
district...
that's
the
burden
that
the
district
court
applied.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
the
burden
was
to
show
that
the
reason
advanced
by
the
defendant,
the
articulation
was
pretextual
or,
as
burdine
suggests,
to
show
that
there
was
evidence
of
intentional
discrimination,
which
is
the
sixth
matter--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
--that's
correct.
that's
what
the
district
court
specifically
found.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
yes,
sir,
that
certainly
could
be
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
it
can't
review
it...
but
that...
that
ultimate
finding
of...
of
intent
is
based
on
some
subsidiary
findings.
and
as
i've
discussed,
all
of
those
subsidiary
findings
are
well
grounded
in
the
record,
and
the
court
of
appeals
can't
reverse
those
if
they're
grounded
in
the
record.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
what
your
honor?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
the
ones
that
the
district
court
used
were...
were...
were
an
objective
weighing
of
the
qualifications.
and
as
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief,
there
is
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
anderson
was
more
qualified
than...
than
mr.
kincaid.
the
district
court
made
that
finding
of
fact.
they
also
made
a
"but
for"
finding.
they
said
but
for
discrimination,
she
would
have
been
selected.
so
those...
those
findings
have
been
made.
and
i
think
that
a
finding
of
relative
qualifications
is
also
protected
by
rule
52.
i
hope
i've
answered
your
question,
your
honor.
in
response
to
the
six
separate
findings
of
discrimination
carefully
delineated
by
the
district
court
in
its
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals'
sole
response
in
footnote
5
was...
and
i
quote
from
that
footnote...
"this
evidence,
however,
is
inadequate
to
support
a
finding
of
bias,
and
it
is
dispelled
by
other
portions
of
the
record.
"
"for
example,
there
is
nothing
to
show
the
male
committee
members
had
a
bias
against
working
women.
"
"all
four
testified
that
their
wives
had
worked
and
were
accustomed
to
being
away
from
home
during
evening
hours.
"
we
contend
that
the
excesses
and
mistakes
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
record
suggest
that
a
standard
other
than
that
which
swint
requires
exists
in
the
fourth
circuit
where
findings
in
favor
of
a
plaintiff
in
an
employment
discrimination...
discrimination
case
were
attacked
on
appeal.
if,
as
we
believe,
the
rule
must
be
what's
swint
for
the
goose
must
be
swint
for
the
gander,
we
respectfully
contend
this
case
should
be
reversed
with
instructions
to
reinstate
the
district
court's
judgment.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
after
ms.
corwin.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor,
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
comment
very,
obviously,
briefly
on
the
method
in
which
the
findings
of
fact
were
prepared,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
footnote
6
of
the
government's
brief.
whatever
ought
to
be
the
rule,
in
this
case
judge
mcmillan
prepared
his
own
findings
of
fact
at
the
end.
he
added
numerous
transcript
references.
there
are
substantial
differences
between
what
the
plaintiff
initially
prepared
and
what
he
prepared.
and
it
was
simply
not
the
work
product
of
what...
of
what
we
presented;
it
was
the
judge's
work
product.
it
was
several
months
later.
and
we
urge
you
to
look
and
compare
those.
the
government
has
done
that,
and
in
its
footnote
6
it
points
out
the
various
distinctions.
so
whatever
the
rule
is...
and
i
agree
that
this
judge
made
his
decision
right
after
trial.
and
it
would
be
totally
unfair
to
penalize
the
plaintiff
because...
in
whom
the
judge
had
ruled.
i
mean
she...
he
ruled
in
ms.
anderson's
favor
two
days...
two
or
three
days
after
the
trial.
and
yet...
and
yet,
now,
because
of
some
procedural
thing,
they
ruled
against
us.
finally,
the
one
other
thing
is
that
on
page--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
--okay.
thank
you.
