chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
anderson
against
city
of
bessemer.
mr.
wallas,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
you
may
raise
that
lectern,
if
you
would
like.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00,
mr.
wallas.
you
may
resume,
mr.
wallas.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
inquiry
to
be
made
how
many
children
you
have
and
what
are
their
ages
if
they
were
addressing
that
only
to
women?
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
say
it
would
smack
of,
but
you
wouldn't
think...
you
didn't
respond
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
ask
that
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
wallas.
ms.
corwin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
van
hoy.
chief
justice
burger
well,
mr.
van
hoy,
isn't
the
practice
which,
at
least
as
i
understand
justice
stevens'
question
and
justice
rehnquist
addressed,
the
common,
overwhelmingly
prevailing
practice
of
all
district
judges
and
all
trial
judges
in
this
country
to
reach
his
conclusion,
ask
the
prevailing
party
to
submit
findings,
refer
them
to
the
other
party,
and
get
comments?
isn't
that
a
logical
extension
of
the
adversary
system?
chief
justice
burger
then
they
are
not
consistent
with
my
experience
of
sitting
and
trying
cases
in
seven
circuits
in
this
country.
the
common
practice
in
federal
courts
was
to
do
exactly
that,
and
frequently
there
was
a
great
engagement
over
the
findings,
and
the
losing
party,
thinking
in
terms
of
appeal
and
rule
52,
would
come
in
and
they'd
have
even
on
rare
occasions
supplemental
arguments
on
a
particular
finding,
which
compelled
the
judge
to
really
go
back
to
the
record.
well,
you
can
trust
your
view
anyway.
chief
justice
burger
isn't
the
language
of
justice
reed's
opinion
in
the
gypsum
case,
the
latter
part
of
the
sentence,
if
the
court
is
left
on
the
entire
evidence,
let
with
the
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
committed,
then
the
court
must
operate--
now,
doesn't
that
by
implication
indicate
that
the
second
reviewing
court,
this
court,
must
lock
at
the
record
if
you
were
to
apply
that
standard?
chief
justice
burger
but
did
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
gypsum...
i
don't
recall...
make
that
distinction
as
pointedly
as
you
make
it
now?
chief
justice
burger
or
is
that
something
that's
evolved
later
on
as...
as
lawyers
and
judges
have
looked
at
the
direct
appeal
and...
and
all
others?
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
conceivably
might
affirm
without
looking
at
the
entire
record,
but
that
if
we
were
going
to
reverse,
we
must
look
at
the
entire
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
one
minute
remaining,
mr.
wallas.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
wallas.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
