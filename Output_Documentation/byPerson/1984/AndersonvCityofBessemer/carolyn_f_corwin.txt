ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
mr.
wallas
has
suggested,
this
case
raises
a
straightforward
question
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
applied
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review.
based
on
our
examination
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
the
record
in
this
case,
we've
concluded
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
the
application
of
that
standard.
there's
no
real
dispute
about
what
the
proper
standard
is
in
this
case.
everyone
agrees
it's
the
clearly
erroneous
standard,
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
apply.
but
we
think
that
in
applying
the
standard,
the
court
of
appeals
departed
from
this
court's
mandate
that
a
reviewing
court
is
not
to
place
itself
in
the
position
of
the
trial
court
and
simply
to
duplicate
the
trial
court's
factfinding
function.
the
united
states
finds
itself
at
various
times
on
both
sides
of
title
vii
cases,
sometimes
as
a
plaintiff
and
sometimes
as
a
defendant.
it
therefore
has
a
general
interest
in
the
proper
application
of
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
in
this
case
there
was
conflicting
testimony
on
a
number
of
points,
and
that
is
almost
always
the
case
with
title
vii
cases
that
go
to
trial.
you
have
different
participants
in
a
personnel
decision
who
have
different
perspectives
on
what
may
have
happened.
here
you
have
five
selection
committee
members
who
testified,
as
well
as
two
of
the
applicants
who
testified.
they
had
different
recollections
of
what
happened
in
the
selection
process.
some
of
the
evidence
that
went
into
the
record
supported
petitioner's
view
that
the
committee
had
discriminated
against
her,
had
decided
that
she
shouldn't
have
the
position
of
recreation
director
because
that
was
an
unsuitable
job
for
a
woman.
there
was
other
evidence
that
was
put
in
by
respondent
that
seemed
to
go
the
other
way,
that
seemed
to
suggest
that
the
committee
members
thought
mr.
kincaid
was
more
qualified
than
petitioner.
the
trial
clerk...
the
trial
court
heard
all
of
that
evidence,
and
it
resolved
the
conflicts
on
the
significant
issues.
our
review
of
the
record--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
suppose
the
"but
for"
goes
to
the
remedy
certainly.
i
think
the
plaintiff
did
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
she
was
discriminated
against;
that
is,
that
the
employer
had
a
discriminatory
motive
in
making
this
particular
hiring
decision.
now,
you
may
get
into
situations
in
which
you
have...
you
have
several
motives,
and
you
may
get
into
a
mt.
healthy
sort
of
analysis
there.
that's
not
this
case
here.
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
there
was
a
single
motive,
and
that
was
discrimination.
and
as
mr.
wallas
suggested,
the
district
court
did...
did
put
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
and
concluded
that
she
had
met
it
in
this
case.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
that...
yes.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
there
are
several
steps
in
this
issue
of
qualifications.
there
is
first
the
definition
of
what
it
was
that
the
selection
committee
was
looking
for,
what
the
city
was
looking
for
in
a
recreation
director.
then
you
move
to
the
qualifications
of
the
applicants
and
how
they
relate
to
those
criteria.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
it
is,
of
course,
conceivable
that
that
can
happen.
if
you
don't
have
evidence,
as
you
did
not
in
this
case,
that
there
is
a
mandated
list
of
qualifications
ahead
of
time,
you
may
well
have
that
evolving,
as
i
think
the
qualification
of
residence
in
bessemer
city
probably
evolved,
as
i
read
the
record,
during
the
selection
process.
but
here
i
think
the
court
looked
at
what
the
selection
committee
members
said
in
the
course
of
the
trial
about
what
they
were
looking
for,
so
it
had
some
evidence
on
just
what
it
was
that
had
evolved
during
the
selection
process.
and
the...
the
court
took
the
selection
committee
members
at
their
word,
and
some
of
them
said
we
were
looking
for
the
all-around
qualifications
of
someone
who
could
provide
a
full
range
of
programs,
not
only
athletics,
but
art,
music,
dance
and
so
on.
our
review
of
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
and
that
the
entire
record...
and
we
agree
with
respondent
that
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
look
at
the
entire
record...
shows
that
the
contrary
evidence
does
not
clearly
outweigh
the
evidence
in
support
of
the
petitioner.
in
these
circumstances
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
concluded
that
the
trial
court
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
we
think
the
trial...
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
went
wrong
in
this
case
because
it
failed
to
give
the
proper
regard
to
the
trial
court's
factfinding
function.
instead
of
asking
how
the
trial
court's
findings
measure
against
the
evidence
in
the
record,
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
taken
a
fresh
look
at
the
record
and
to
have
put
itself
in
the
position
of
the
trial
court.
i
would
like
to
refer
just
for
a
moment
to
digress
on
few
points
that
we
think
may
create
some
confusion
and
that
the
court
might
want
to
address
in
deciding
this
case.
one
of
them
was
raised
by
justice
powell.
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
court's...
the
court
of
appeals'
flat
statement
that
petitioner
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
she
was
better
qualified
than
mr.
kincaid.
now,
the
trial
court
did
find
that
she
was
better
qualified
based
on
what
it
understood
the
qualifications
to
be
based
on
the
testimony;
so
i'm
not
sure
it
affects
the
bottom
line
in
this
case.
but
the
statement
seems
to
suggest
that
even
when
the
plaintiff
has...
has
shown
affirmatively
that
an
employer
acted
for
a
discriminatory
motive
that
she
somehow
can't
prevail
if
she
was
only
equally
qualified.
that
seems
counter
to
what
the
court
said
in
burdine,
and
it
also
seems
counter
to
the
court's
explanation
in
the
aikens
case
that
you
look
at
all
types
of
evidence;
you
look
at
the
full
range
of
evidence
on
discriminatory
motive.
here
you
had
not
only
the
evidence
on
qualifications,
but
you
had
some
other
evidence
about
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
committee
members
and
the
way
they
went
about
their
selection
process
that
was
also
relevant.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
liability,
but
i
think
at
least
the
employee
has
an
injunctive
remedy
in
that
case
if
the
employer
has
acted
with
a
discriminatory
motive.
you
may
get
to
the
second
step
in
which
you
inquire
about
the
remedy,
and
you
make
the
mt.
healthy
inquiry,
and
that
may
be
more
complicated.
you
may
have
to
sort
more
out
and...
and
put
the
burden
on
the
employer
at
that
point
to
show
that
he
would
have
hired
the
other
person
in
any
event.
but
here
we
are
just...
we
are
talking
about
title
vii
liability
in
a
single
motive
case.
as
i
noted
earlier,
here
the
trial
court
found
that
the
qualifications...
that
that
was
a
pretextual
point
on
the
part
of
the
employer,
and
that
the
only
motive
you
had
was
discrimination
in
this
case.
we
also
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
there
is
a
problem
with
this
working
wife
defense
issue,
and
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
seems
to
be
phrased
in
a
way
that
at
least
suggests
to
other
courts
and
to
litigants
that
this
may
be
relevant
evidence.
we've
suggested
in
our
brief
we
think
that
common
sense
indicates
that
is
simply
not
relevant
evidence
in
most
contexts
in
most
title
vii
cases.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
think
we
regard
that
as
subsumed
in
the
application
of
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
it...
it
might
be
enough
for
this
court
to
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
misapplied
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
i
can't
give
you
any
out--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
really
in
the
business
of
doing
that--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
think
that's
right,
and
i...
and
i
think
the
court
at
that
point
can
say
that
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
was
misapplied,
and...
and
there
we
would
regard
as
part
of
that
argument
the
further
point
that
under
rule
52(a)
you
have
to
give
due
regard
to
the
credibility
determinations
of
the
trial
court.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
we
have
not
taken
a
position
on
that
part
of
the
brief.
i...
i
think
there
is
plenty
of
common
sense
that
says
that
the
trial
court
is
the
only
one
who
can
observe
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses,
and
for
that
reason,
you
ought
to
give
great
weight.
this
court
has
said
that
before,
and
i
think
rule
52(a)
indicates--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i...
i
think
that
there
is
some
sense
to
what
the
petitioner
has
said
about
the
fact
that
you
may
have
the
weight
of
the
evidence
affecting
how
you
come
down
on
whether
a
particular
piece
of
evidence...
and
it
may
be
oral
testimony...
whether
that
is
believable
or
not.
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
sense
to
decide
that
question
in
the
abstract.
i
think
here
it
is
part
of
the
overall
clearly
erroneous
standard.
thank
you.
