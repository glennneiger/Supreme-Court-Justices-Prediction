mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent's
position
in
this
matter
is
that
the
only
proper
issue
to
which
at
least
to
some
extent
is
agreed
by
the
petitioner
is
whether
the
fourth
circuit
properly
conducted
its
review
of
the
critical
subsidiary
and
ultimate
finding
of
discrimination
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
rule
52.
where
we
very
clearly
part
company
and
believe
that
we
have
the
weight
of...
the
authority
of
this
great
court
over
the
last
40
years
in
stare
decisis
in
decision
after
decision
is
where
we
disagree
with
the
petitioner's
position...
and
it's
on
page
4
of
their
reply
brief...
where
they
say
that
a
court
of
appeals
cannot
reverse...
and
that's
clearly
erroneous...
a
district
court
opinion
which
is
supported
by
evidence
which
by
itself
may
appear
to
be
substantial
or
even
by
substantial
evidence.
we
have,
of
course,
the
seminal
decision
of
u.s.
gypsum
of
this
court
in
1948
that
says
that
the
not
only
opportunity
but
duty
of
the
reviewing
court
on
factual
matters
is
to
review
the
entire
evidence
and
to
reverse
if
it
determines
that
a
mistake
has
occurred,
and
that
it
has
concluded
that
such
a
mistake
has
occurred
in
how
the
facts
have
been
viewed
by
the
district
court.
that
1948
decision,
which
has
been
cited
in
so
many
subsequent
decisions
by
this
court,
was
cited
specifically
and
applied
both
in
determining
the
subsidiary
effects
to
be
judged
in
a
clearly
erroneous
basis
by
the
district
court,
and
the
ultimate
fact
of
intentional
bias.
the
u.s.
gypsum
court
was
cited
relative
to
each
of
these
in
a
seriatim
fashion.
first
the
court
looked
at
the
issue
of
disparate
selection
criteria...
that
is,
whether
everyone
was
asked
about
the
night
work
inquiry...
applied
rule
52,
applied
u.s.
gypsum.
it
did
the
similar
thing
on
the
qualifications
issue.
and
then
after
reviewing
the
evidence
as
a
whole,
in
stating
that
it
did,
it
said
absent
record
evidence
to
support
those
two
subsidiary
findings
of
bias,
the
rest
of
the
record,
particularly
relative
to
the
plaintiff's
continued
burden
of
proof
in
title
vii
cases,
is
simply
insufficient
to
establish
bias;
that
is,
insufficient
to
carry
the
plaintiff's
burdine
burden
of
proof...
burdine
and
related
cases.
now--
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
--yes,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
not...
well,
it
depends
on
your
definition
of
consistent.
there
are
cases
where
his
decisions
have
been
affirmed...
klein
v.
railway
express,
for
example.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
very
few.
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
that
particular
judge,
that
is
correct.
that
is
not
so
as
to
other
district
court
judges
in
the
fourth
circuit.
but,
justice
blackmun,
as
to
your
observation
about
this
particular
judge,
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
any
opinion
i
would
offer
would
certainly
be
a
personal
one
in
that
regard.
i
would
suggest
that
in
many
cases,
including
this
one,
that
is
the
case
because
of
the
delegation
of
the
opinion-writing
function.
after
being
admonished
by
the
fourth
circuit,
that
he
has
continued
to
do
that
in
a
number
of
subsequent
cases,
and
that,
therefore,
his
factfinding
his
is
entitled
to
less
weight
than
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
as
it
has
been
defined
by
this
court
in
the
crescent
amusement
case,
for
example;
that
the
genesis,
the
etiology
of
the
opinion
has
affected
and
afflicted
the
result
of
the
outcome
of
a
number
of
these
fourth
circuit
opinions
on
review
from
this
particular
district
court.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
as
a
general
proposition
i
do
in
the
manner
in
which
it
occurred,
the
chronology
in
which
it
occurred
in
this
case.
and
i
make
that
suggestion
because
by
reference
to
the
crescent
amusement
case,
the
el
paso
natural
gas
case
from
this
court
that
says
since
we
operate
in
an
adversary
system
of
law...
that's
our
anglo-american
tradition...
the
obligation
and
responsibility
of
the
counsel
is
to
be
an
adversary
for
his
party.
if
the
court
announces
the
opinion
of
the
court
without
more
or
without
much
more,
as
in
this
case,
a
very
conclusory
opinion,
very
generally
stated,
and
then
leaves
it
to
an
adversary
to
write
that
opinion
for
the
court,
it
is
inevitable...
and
it
occurred
in
this
very
case;
this
case
is
illustrative...
that
you
will
get
an
opinion
generated
by
that
adversary
which
emphasizes
the
points
in
his
favor
and
either
fails
to
consider
or
doesn't
emphasize
the
other
ones.
excuse
me.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
in
this
particular
case,
yes.
this
was
a
permutation
of--
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
--justice
stevens,
what
is
wrong
with
that
decision,
and
as
at
least
the
third
circuit
has
held
in
the
case
we
cited
in
our
brief,
is
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
already
been
announced.
there
is
an
inherent
advantage
given
to
the
party
who
is
to
prevail
because
he
knows
that
he's
got
the
force
of
the
court's
opinion
behind
him
already.
i
would
suggest
to
you...
excuse
me.
yes,
justice...
chief
justice
burger.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
that
permitting,
as
in
this
case,
permitting
the
other
side,
the
losing
side,
to
respond
does
not
cure
that
defect.
what
it
did
in
this
case,
we
felt
compelled
to
respond
because
of
another
case
pending
in
the
fourth
circuit
at
the
same
time,
which
this
court
had
denied
cert
in,
the
lily
v.
harris-teeter
case.
the
fourth
circuit
stated
in
oral
argument
if
you
don't
comment
on
the
proposals
that
have
been
drafted
by
plaintiff's
counsel
or
the
prevailing
party's
counsel,
you
have
not
exhausted
the
remedies
necessary
to
preserve
your
issue
on
appeal.
we
felt
therefore
constrained
to
do
so.
we
did
so
with
the
result...
and
once
again,
this
case
is
illustrative
of
the
problems
with
this
sort
of
process...
we
came
back
with
an
initial
memorandum
of
decision,
a
decision
announcing
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
two-page
decision
that
said
the
successful
job
candidate
was
not
asked
about
night
work.
the
initial
opinion
drafted
for
the
court,
the
expanded
28-page
opinion
by
the
plaintiff's
counsel,
said
the
same
thing.
we
commented
on
it
and
demonstrated
through
several
different
places
in
the
record
that
every
witness
had
testified
that
at
least
mr.
kincaid,
the
successful
applicant
had
been
asked.
the
plaintiff's
own...
own
witness
on
the
selection
committee
had
said
so.
then
we
come
back
with
in
the
chronology
at
this
memorandum
of
decision,
the
plaintiff's
counsel's
opinion,
our
comment
saying
that
it
just
didn't
happen
that
way.
the
court,
in
a
sense,
has
an
opportunity
to
try
to
appeal
brief
its
case,
as
it
did
here,
by
incorporating
changes
into
the
final
opinion
that
say
now
that
i've
seen
the
comments
made
by
the
defendant's
counsel,
i
admit
that
the
question
was
asked,
but
i
will
discount
it
as
a
credibility
determination.
i
now
say
in
my
final
opinion,
having
had
all
this
work
product
from
three
different
sources
to
look
at,
that
the
question
was
asked,
but
was
only
asked
facetiously
and
out
of
frustration,
which
is,
i
would
say,
number
one,
a
distortion
of
the
proper
view
of
the
trial
court
in
deciding
what
is
a
credibility
determination.
because
that's
how
it
developed,
that
was
the
genesis
of
the
credibility
determination
we're
talking
about
in
this
case,
not
that
it
was
made
ab
initio
by
the
court.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
it
has
been
suggested
by
a
number
of
courts,
including
the
fourth
circuit,
that
if
the
court
wishes
to
utilize
the
input
of
the
parties
that
it
do
so
before
making
the
submission
of
its
judgment
of
what
the
result
will
be,
and
that
it
consider...
elicit
and
consider
that
input
from
both
sides,
not
in
a...
not
in
one
side
and
then
the
other
commenting
on
it.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
yes,
and
i...
our
position
is
that
we
agree
with
what
they
refer
to
as
close
scrutiny
being
justified
by
these
facts.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
once
again,
since
the
work
product
of
the
court
is
actually
the
work
product
of
the
adversary.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
yes,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
it...
to
reiterate,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
cases
before,
that
this
is
a
problematic
area.
the
most
basic
disagreement
between
the
parties
is,
once
again,
whether
if
a
case
is
supported
by
some
substantial
evidence,
is
the
court
of
appeals
allowed
to
review
it
at
all.
we
say
that
it
clearly
can
do
so.
i
would
cite
in
particular
the
dayton
school
case,
the
brinkman
case
the
second
time
it
came
to
this
court,
where
the
court
described
that
rule
52
duty
as
an
unavoidable
duty
to
reverse
if
the
district
court's
factfinding
was
clearly
erroneous.
and
that's
ever
if
the
subsidiary
facts,
subsidiary
to
the
issue
of
discrimination...
it
was
discrimination
as
to...
in
the
context
of
school
busing
in
that
case,
or
school
segregation...
but
still
discrimination,
as
in
this
case,
if
the
subsidiary
facts
are
uncontroverted,
that
the
district
court...
excuse
me...
the
court
of
appeals
of
first
review
has
the,
as
this
court
put
it,
unavoidable
duty
to
see
if
that
ultimate
determination
can
stand
the
weight
of
scrutiny
of
the
entire
evidence.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
i
frankly,
your
honor,
do
not
know
what
the
national
practice
is.
my
practice
is
within
the
three
courts
of
north
carolina
and
the
12
district
judges
within
that
state.
i
can
say,
having
tried
cases
before
all
but
two
of
them,
that
i
have
never
seen
the
process
used
by
any
other
district
judge
within
the
state
of
north
carolina.
that's
my
universe
of
experience.
that's
all
i
can
say.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
yes,
sir.
it
has
been
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
the
inwood
case
and
in
the
swint
case
that
although
a
review
of
the
entire
evidence
to
determine
whether
factual
conclusions...
excuse
me...
factual
findings
by
the
district
courts
are
erroneous,
clearly
erroneous
or
not,
that
that
is
justified,
but
that
a
de
novo
review
of
the
record
is
not
justified.
thus,
the
question
becomes
what
is
the
distinction
between
a
rule
52
gypsum
sort
of
review
of
the
entire
evidence
as
opposed
to
a
de
novo
review,
since
one
is
not
only
permitted
but
mandated,
and
the
other
one
is
clearly
precluded.
we
would
point
out
for
the
consideration
of
the
court
that
the
distinction
is
twofold.
number
one,
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
justice
white's
opinion
in
the
swint
case,
an
opinion
drafted
free
of
the
strictures
of
rule
52(a),
equals
an
opinion
which
is
undertaken
de
novo
review;
and
number
two,
and
more
specifically,
that
reversing
a
trial
court
without
holding
that
the
trial
court's
findings
were
clearly
erroneous
by
review
of
the
entire
record
constitutes
a
de
novo
review.
in
that
regard
we
would
argue
to
this
court
that
the
review
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
stated
the
applicable
legal
standard,
rule
52,
and
the
gypsum
case,
and
at
least
sub
silenio
applied
gypsum's
progeny
in
reaching
by
review
of
an
entire
record
the
appropriate
conclusion
and
perhaps
inescapable
conclusion,
given
the
plaintiff's
burden
of
proof,
that
clear
error
had
abounded
in
the
district
court's
decision.
that
is
our
position
as
to
why
de
novo
review,
which
is
one
of
the
concerns
of
the
government
in
this
action,
was
not
what
occurred
in
this
case
and
is
why
this
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
swint
case
in
that
regard
where
the--
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
--yes.
now,
i...
if
i
may
be
presumptuous
enough
to
do
so
without
really
knowing
what
went
into
the
thought
processes
of
the
fourth
circuit
panel
and
the
entire
fourth
circuit
when
the
request
for
reconsideration
in
this
case
was
denied
unanimously,
i
would
suggest
that
they
looked
at
the
decision
and
its
genesis,
that
it
had
been
generated,
at
least
substantially,
with
some
minor
revisions
to
help
perhaps
get
around
the
credibility
problems,
by
an
adversary,
and
since
all
of
us
in
the
bar
and
on
the
courts
are
products
of
the
adversary
system,
we
know
what
that
can
result
in.
i
may
be
making
the
point
or
attempting
to
make
the
point
with
a
little
too
much
reiteration,
but
that...
that
is
my
impression,
and
i
believe
supported
by
the
case
law,
as
to
how
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
and
a
number
of
other
cases
determined
that
close
scrutiny
was
required.
it
related
to
how
the
opinion
came
to
be.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
i
would
not...
justice
o'connor,
i
would
not
agree
that
two
the
principles
are
mutually
exclusive;
that
close
scrutiny
does
not
foreclose
the
usual
deference
given
to
and
required
by
rule
52.
the
point
i
would
also
make
is
that
the
corollary
of
rule
52
to
the
general
deference
given
to
the
factfinding
responsibility
and
function
of
the
trial
court
is
also
contained
in
rule
52
where
the
rule
states
specifically
that
factfinding
will
be
accomplished
by
the
court
specially...
not
by
the
parties,
but
by
the
court.
that
is
right
there
in
the
very
first
sentence
of
rule
52
and
is
the
corollary,
the
quid
pro
quo,
for
the
deference
to
the
factfinding
by
the
court
of
first
review.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
i
don't
think
the
standard
of
review
is
any
different,
justice
rehnquist.
not
that
the
standard
of
review
is
different,
but
that
the
assumption
that
the
facts
that
come
to
the
first
reviewing
court...
in
this
case,
the
fourth
circuit...
are
necessarily
going
to
be
supported
by
the
record
or
are
more
likely
to
be;
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
record
to
see.
that
may
be
a
pretty
fine
distinction,
but
i
believe
that's
what
the
distinction
is.
now,
in
that
regard,
justice
rehnquist,
there
was
a
question
during
my
opposing
counsel's
oral
argument,
i
think,
about
the
related...
i'm
sorry;
it
escapes
me
right
now,
but
i'll
come
back...
oh,
whether
this
court
serves
the
same
function
as
the
fourth
circuit
did
in
applying
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
i
would
suggest
that
the
answer
is
no.
if
this
court
were
the
court
of
first
review
of
the
factual
determinations...
that
is,
in
a
direct
appeal
case
such
as
the
u.s.
gypsum
case...
the
answer
would
be
yes.
but
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
function
of
this
court
at
this
level
is
to
give
a...
once
again
to
look
at
the
entire
record
as
a
whole
to
determine
if
the
fourth
circuit's
finding
of
clear
error
was
correct
vis-a-vis
the
district
court.
and
i
think
the
distinction
there
is
between
direct
appeal
cases
and
at
what
point
this
court
is
or
is
not
the
court
of
first
review
on
the
factual
issues.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
chief
justice
burger,
my
recollection...
and
i
believe
i'm
correct
on
it...
is
that
that
case
was
a
direct
appeal
case
under
an
antitrust
law,
which
in
1948
somehow
became...
came
to
this
court
on
direct
appeal.
i
don't
believe
this
was
the
second
court
of
review
of
the
gypsum
decision.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
implicitly--
mr.

m.

--that
historical
development
i...
i...
i
do
not
know,
frankly.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
justice
marshall,
i
think
i
may
have
misstated
our
intent
in
this
regard.
we
would
not
only
discourage
this
court
from...
not
only
not
discourage
this
court
from
reading
the
entire
record,
but
given
the
manner
in
which
the
record
has
been
presented
in
the
briefs,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
do
so
to
determine
what
the
real
facts
are
in
this
record.
what
i...
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
is
our
position
that
whether...
the
issue
of
whether
this
court
is
to
re-evaluate
every
fact
to
determine
whether
there
was
clear
error
is
not
the
proper
function
of
this
court...
error
on
the
factual
issues.
on
the
legal
issues,
yes;
on
the
factual
issues,
no.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
no.
i'm
encouraging...
we
are
encouraging
the
court
to
look
at
the
entire
record,
certainly
not
to
assume
that
what
we
say
about
the
record
is
correct
or
that
what
the
other
party
says
is
correct,
because
there
are
certainly
distinctions
in
that
record,
to
say
the
least.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
no.
applying
the
facts
to
the
law.
there...
there
is
an...
an
inference
possible
that,
for
example,
relative
to
the
qualifications
issue
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
shifted
to
the
defendants
to
show
the
absence
of
discrimination.
that...
that...
this
record
is
susceptible
of
that
interpretation.
that
is
not
your
position,
that
there
were
legal
errors.
in
fact,
our
position
is
that
the
strictures
of
rule
52
are
well
set
out,
that
the
fourth
circuit
does
have
clearly
the
authority
under
gypsum
and
its...
the
cases
following
gypsum
to
review
the
entire
record
to
determine
if
there
was
clear
error,
even
if
there
are
credibility
issues
involved,
and
that
there
really
is
no
legal
issue
in
this
case
at
this
time,
nonetheless
any
one
of
momentous
proportions.
we
think
the
stare
decisis
clearly
dictates
the
way
that
this
case
would
go,
and
that
that
is
that
the
fourth
circuit
acted...
knew
what
it's
authority
was
under
the
swint
case,
under
the
gypsum
case,
and
that
it
applied
that
authority
correctly
in
reviewing
the
entire
evidence.
on
the
issue
of
credibility,
which
has
been
broached
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
we
have
several
observations
to
make
in
that
regard.
number
one,
we
do
not
believe
that
it's
actual
justiciable
issue
in
this
case,
because
the
only
references
to
credibility
in
this
action
in
the
record
below...
and
i
must
get
back
to
the
genesis
of
the
opinion
to
address
that...
are
general
findings
in
the
final
opinion
of
the
court
adopted
from
the
plaintiff's
counsel's
draft,
expanded
draft
of
the
memorandum
decision,
prefatory
language
in
the
first
part
that
says
after
viewing
the
witnesses
and
making
the
necessary
credibility
determinations,
i
make
the
following
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
that's
the
only
place
credibility
really
comes
out.
it
was
not
in
in
the
initial
decision.
number
two,
we
reiterate
that
even
if
there
are
genuine
germane
credibility
issues
here,
that
the
fourth
circuit,
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard,
still
has
authority
to
review.
and
in
this
regard,
we
disagree
quite
directly
with
the
opinion
of
the
amicus
aclu,
and
to
the
extent
that
that
opinion
is
expressed
by
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
the
credibility
issue
was
not
related
to
any
specific
factfindings
in
the
district
court
other
than
this
matter
i
addressed
earlier:
that
the
successful
applicant
initially,
it
was
determined
by
the
district
court,
was
not
asked
a
question
which
the
court
later
said
he
was
asked
but
only
facetiously
after
our
side,
the
defendants,
had
commented
on
the
case
to
the
court.
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
yes,
yes.
on
the
basis
of
the
plaintiff's
own
witness
and
her
admission--
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
--that's
right.
as--
mr.
philip
m.
van
hoy
--oh,
yes,
yes...
the
night
work
question.
because
it
was
right
there
in
the
record
that
the
plaintiff's
own
witness
on
the
selection
committee
had,
as
she
said
herself
and
volunteered
the
testimony,
and
i
asked
him
myself
what
will
your
new
wife
think
about
you
working
at
night;
that
it
was
a
historical
fact
from
the
record,
but
it
was
only
susceptible
of
that
interpretation
because
of
what
she'd
said.
it's
analogous
to
a
point
justice
rehnquist
made
last
spring
in
the
arguments
in
the
bose
case
and
which
it
is
why
it
is
so
necessary
that
the
collective
wisdom
of
the
appellate
process
be
applied
to...
under
the
strictures
of
rule
52
to
be
able
to
determine
whether
the
credibility
determinations
or
any
sorts
of
fact
determinations
will
stand
the
light
of
analysis.
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out...
and
i
gather
from
the
transcript
he
looked
at
the
clock
when
he
said
so
that
day...
he
said
if
a
witness
says
at
the
district
court
level
it
is
not
now
ten
minutes
till
2:00
and
the
judge
agrees,
if
that
is
not
historical
fact,
there
must
be
a
way
to
review
it.
and
that's
what
our
position
here
is.
now,
in
very
recent
cases
this
court
in
a
number
of
decisions
has
reached
results
which
very
clearly
implicate
increased
civil
rights,
job
rights
for
individuals.
i
would
point
out,
for
example,
the
hishon
v.
king
and
spaulding
case,
the
cooper
v.
federal
reserve
case,
the
u.s.
jaycees
case.
if
the
right
and
responsibility,
the
duty,
as
this
court
has
put
it,
to
review
factual
determinations
is
minimized
by
some
decision
that
comes
out
of
this
court,
there
will
be
no
clear
message
or
clear
result
of
increased
civil
rights.
take,
for
example,
the
situation
of
a
judge
skeptical
of
title
vii
at
the
district
court
level,
particularly
in
an
era
when
the
selection
of
the
federal
district
judges
has
become
a
matter
of
such
highly
politicized
magnitude
that
one
of
the
political
parties
is
saying
unless
you
pass
a
litmus
test
on
a
particular
issue,
which
this
court
has
addressed,
you
shouldn't
be
qualified
as
a
district
court
judge.
that's...
that's
a
position
of
a
political
party
now.
say
that
we
end
up
with
someone
who's
skeptical
of
title
vii
on
a
district
court.
he
is...
he
or
she
would
be
just
as
unfettered
in
casting
the
talismanic
characterization
of
credibility
on
a
factfinding
which
is
not
supported
by
the
record
with
which
he
happened
to
agree
as
a
political
matter,
he
or
she,
as
a
political
matter,
and
insulate
the
opinion
from
review.
this
case
would
not
be
a
blessing
for
the
civil
rights
community.
it
would
be
a
mixed
blessing
at
best;
a
parochial
result
at
worst.
thank
you.
