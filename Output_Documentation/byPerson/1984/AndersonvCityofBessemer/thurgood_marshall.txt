justice
marshall
mr.
van
hoy,
let
me
try
this.
you're
asked...
we
are
being
asked
by
the
other
side
to
decide
as
to
whether
the
fourth
circuit
is
correct.
the
fourth
circuit
based
its
opinion
on
reading
the
whole
record.
how
can
we
decide
whether
they're
right
or
wrong
without
also
reading
the
whole
record,
end
of
quote.
