justice
white
ms.
corwin,
as
well
as
your
general
view
of
how
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
under
rule
52,
is
there
some
subsidiary
question
about
how
they
dealt
with
the
trial
court's
credibility--
justice
white
--findings.
is
that
part...
is
that
subsumed
in
your
argument?
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that...
let's
assume
that
the
only
thing
that
was
wrong,
that
was
arguably
wrong
with
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
that
it
seemed
to
disregard
the...
at
least
on
one
or
two
factual
issues...
the
credibility
conclusions
of
the
district
court,
but
otherwise
complied
with
rule
52.
would
that
be
enough
to
reverse?
justice
white
do
you
think
that's
part
of
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
to
say
that
a
district
judge
says
we
have
contradictory
testimony
on
the
same
historical
fact,
and
i
just
happen
to
believe
a
instead
of
b,
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
well,
we
happen
to
believe
b
instead
of
a?
justice
white
i
know
it
isn't,
but
part
of
the...
as
i
understand
it,
part
of
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
with
respect
to
one
or
two
facts.
justice
white
do
you
agree
with
the
petitioner's
discussion
of
the...
of
the
credibility
findings,
which
kind
of
credibility
findings
should
just
not
tinker
with
at
all,
and
others
that
it...
do
you
agree
with
that
part
of
its
brief?
justice
white
and
is
that
enough
to
just
give...
give
it
great
weight?
can
the
court
of
appeals
ever
disagree
with
a
credibility
finding
if
it's
expressed
as
such?
justice
white
--well,
is
that
really
consistent
with
rule
52?
justice
white
well,
nevertheless,
the...
on
that
very
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
a
different
conclusion,
didn't
they?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
i
know,
but
the
district
court
said
the...
the
district
court
had
it
one
way
and
the
court
of
appeals
another
on
a
historical
fact.
justice
white
now,
what
business...
what
business
has
the
court
of
appeals
got
doing
that?
i
mean
it
was
on
a
rather
relevant
fact.
