justice
rehnquist
but
i
think
mobility
may
have
been
the
end,
not
the
beginning,
though.
because
a
case
like
cady
says
that
there
are
some
unusual
circumstances
where,
even
though
not
mobile,
the
automobile
exception
applied.
but
i
am
hardpressed
to
think
of
a
case
where
we
have
said
that,
even
though
mobile,
the
automobile
exception
does
not
apply.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
would
say
this
mobile
home
was
closer
to
an
automobile
than
to
a
trunk?
justice
rehnquist
than
to
a
trunk?
justice
rehnquist
than
to
a
trunk.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
sensible
to
start
with
the
automobile
and
say,
you
know,
this
may
differ,
it
has
similarities,
it
has
differences,
rather
than
start
with
something
else
that
it
really
doesn't
resemble
at
all.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
carry
around
a
lot
of
intimate
items
in
your
trunk?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
chadwick
case
is
still
good
law?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
homann,
in
answering
justice
marshall's
question
just
now,
you
said
if
this
thing
looks
like
a
motor
home.
now
can
you
say
in
a
couple
sentences
what
you
think
a
motor
home
looks
like?
justice
rehnquist
you
say
it
has
trailers?
justice
rehnquist
it
is
a
self-contained
single
unit?
justice
rehnquist
with
the
cab
in
front
from
which
you
drive?
justice
rehnquist
of
course
you
can't
always
tell
that
from
the
outside.
i
thought
your
description
would
enable
us
to
tell
from
the
outside
whether
or
not
it
was
subject...
or
should
get
this--
justice
rehnquist
--how
would
your
test
decide
the
van
question
where
all
you
see
is
a
closed
van?
justice
rehnquist
would
it
be
enough
under
your
test
if
the
defendant
claiming
the
right
testified
that
he
simply
has
a
sleeping
bag,
sleeps
in
the
back
of
his
van,
but
drives
from
place
to
place.
but
that's
the
only
living
place
he
has
according
to
his
testimony.
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
do
you
draw
the
line
between
the
situation
that
you
say
obtains
here
where
it
was
parked
and
there
was
no
indication
it
was
about
to
be
moved,
and
the
fact
that
it
is
actually
in
movement?
