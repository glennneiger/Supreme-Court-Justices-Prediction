justice
marshall
what
ever
happened
to
the
charge
of
the
sexual
charge?
justice
marshall
would
you
buy
the
guideline
of
wheels?
justice
marshall
that
if
the
vehicle
has
wheels
on
it,
it's
not
a
home.
justice
marshall
would
you
be
satisfied
with
that
guideline?
justice
marshall
you
want
to
cloud
it
up
now.
justice
marshall
what
would
you
do
with
a
houseboat?
justice
marshall
it
has
wheels?
justice
marshall
well,
i
want
to
be
more
specific.
there
is
a
houseboat.
it's
tied
up
to
a
dock
that's
got
no
motor
on
it
at
all.
it's
just
sitting
there.
and
it's
hocked
up
to
the
sewage,
electricity,
et
cetera,
and
it's
right
beside
a
house.
the
house
is
covered,
and
the
boat
is
not?
justice
marshall
but
the
automobile
has
a
motor
in
it--
justice
marshall
--and
the
houseboat
does
not.
justice
marshall
there
"may
be".
may
be.
i've
seen
houses
moved,
too.
[laughter]
justice
marshall
you've
got
to
get
more
than
that.
justice
marshall
well,
let
me
add
one
more
thing.
it's
been
tied
up
there
for
the
last
36
years.
[laughter]
justice
marshall
the
moral
is,
don't
live
in
a
houseboat.
justice
marshall
i
thought
all
those
cases
said
that
the
possibility
of
them
moving
was
the
issue.
isn't
that
right?
justice
marshall
good
enough.
justice
marshall
well,
you
had
the
possibility
of
movement
here,
didn't
you?
justice
marshall
why
not?
justice
marshall
well,
couldn't
somebody
have
pulled
the
curtains
back
and
driven
off?
justice
marshall
how
do
you
know?
justice
marshall
we're
getting
closer
to
your
case.
suppose
somebody
drives
a
great
big
stretch
cadillac
down
and
puts
it
in
a
parking
lot,
and
pulls
all
the
curtains
around
it,
including
the
one
over
the
windshield
and
around
all
the
rest
of
them.
would
that
be
a
home?
justice
marshall
what
else?
justice
marshall
well,
it
has
everything
in
the
back
of
it
that
your
car
has.
justice
marshall
yes,
yes.
justice
marshall
that
would
be
a
home.
justice
marshall
it
would
be
a
home?
justice
marshall
you
just
can't
say
it
would
be
a
home,
can
you?
[laughter]
justice
marshall
mr.
homann,
what
about
a
van?
you
see
thousands
of
them
on
the
road.
justice
marshall
well,
i've
seen
some
with
the
chairs,
all
upholstered
chairs
in
them.
justice
marshall
in
order
to
help
you
out,
the
van
is
running
down
the
road
at
55
miles
per
hour.
justice
marshall
well,
could
they
have
waited?
in
your
case,
could
they
have
waived
until
he
moved
the
van?
justice
marshall
would
that
have
been
all
right?
justice
marshall
so
your
bright
line
is
that
it
has
to
move?
