justice
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
the
character
of
the
parking
lot?
was
it
public,
where
you
had
to
pay
so
much
an
hour?
or
was
it
an
empty
lot?
justice
stevens
may
i
inquire,
just
so
i
understand
your
position?
is
it
that
the
vehicle
have
wheels?
could
a
trailer
without
a
tractor
in
front
of
it
qualify?
justice
stevens
i'm
sorry?
what
is
your
position.
you
tell
me
your
position.
justice
stevens
now
does
that
mean
self-propelled?
justice
stevens
it
has
to
be
self-propelled?
justice
stevens
so
you
wouldn't
apply
your
thought
to
a
trailer
park?
justice
stevens
but
when
what
about
a
self-propelled
vehicle
that's
plugged
into
the
plumbing
and
the
electricity?
justice
stevens
be
covered?
you
mean
they
could
search
it
without
a
warrant?
or
they
would
need
a
warrant?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
and
you
would
apply
it,
even
if
it
had
been
parked
there
three
months
or
so,
because
your
officer
wouldn't
really
know
how
long
it
had
been
parked?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
what
about
a
camper's
tent,
if
the
camper
takes
his
things
out
of
the
motor
home
and
pitches
a
tent
next
to
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
why...
justice
o'connor's
question
intrigues
me.
why
wouldn't
the
tent
be
just
as
mobile
as
the
self-propelled
vehicle?
i
gather
you
can
pull
it
down
pretty
fast--
--it
doesn't
have
wheels,
right?
--and
throw
it
on
the
back.
[laughter]
pardon
me?
justice
stevens
i
didn't
hear
that.
justice
stevens
but
you
can
surely
move
it
just
the
same.
but
it
is
moveable.
justice
stevens
and
i
should
think
your
reasoning
would
apply.
i'm
not
saying
you
are
right
or
wrong.
justice
stevens
but
your
analysis...
and
maybe
you're
right...
but
you
entirely
omit
any
consideration
of
the
magnitude
of
the
privacy
interest,
the
fact
that
somebody
lives
in
it,
like
a
tent,
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
justice
stevens
well,
the
thing
i'm
puzzled
about
is,
i
understand
the
value
of
a
bright
line
test
certainly,
but
i'm
not
sure
that...
the
california
court
may
be
wrong,
but
it's
test
is
also
a
bright
line
test,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
so
that
arguing
for
a
bright
line
test
really
doesn't
help
us
decide
which
test
is
the
best
one.
justice
stevens
but
you
can't
really
argue
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
probable
cause
determination
comes
before
or
after
the
search.
we're
mainly
interested
in
the
innocent
person,
not
the
guilty
one.
justice
stevens
and
if
you
have
it
before,
presumably
the
search
won't
take
place.
justice
stevens
well,
in
ross
the
car
wasn't
parked
in
the
driveway.
justice
stevens
so
the
facts
are
different.
justice
stevens
i
thought
the
boy
went
back
and
he
knocked
on
the
door
and
the
owner
came
up?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
your
earlier
statement
that
nobody
was
there.
he
was
there.
justice
stevens
oh,
in
other
words
you're
saying
that...
well,
what
was
the
officer
supposed
to
do,
then?
just
hold
him
there
while
they
went
and
got
a
warrant?
justice
stevens
but
your
point
is
he
should
have
gotten
the
warrant
after
he
knocked
down
the
door,
not
before?
that
the
boy's
testimony,
or
the
boy's
comments
weren't
enough?
justice
stevens
mr.
homann,
maybe
i
am
incorrect,
but
i
think
i
understand
your
position
to
be
substantially
the
same
as
the
solicitor
general's
second
position...
not
the
one
he
favors,
but
the
one
he
advocates
in
his
long
footnote
toward
the
end
of
his
brief.
am
i
correct?
justice
stevens
but
your
position
is
basically
his
fallback
position?
justice
stevens
but
the
california
court
did
rely
on
the
statutory
definition.
they
didn't
use
the
term
that
your
opponent
used,
but
they
did
on
page
a-18
they
talk
about
section
3.96
of
the
health
and
safety
code,
and
section
18.008
of
the
whole
home...
referring
to--
justice
stevens
--so
they
did
have,
it
seems
to
me,
a
legislative
determination
of
the
kind
of
vehicle
they
had
in
mind.
justice
stevens
and
it's
licensed.
it
has
a
special
license.
