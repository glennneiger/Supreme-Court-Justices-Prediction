mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
the
state
of
california's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
california
supreme
court.
after
a
brief
review
of
the
facts
below,
the
petitioner
will
advance
two
contentions:
that
there
is
a
need
for
bright
line
guidance
in
the
area
of
search
and
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
standard.
secondly,
that
this
court's
decisions
in
carrol
v.
united
states,
chambers
v.
maroney,
and
united
states
v.
ross
provide
bright
line
guidance
in
their
use
of
inherent
mobility
as
the
underlying
basis
for
the
vehicle
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment's
warrant
requirements.
had
your
honors
been
at
port
and
clausa
in
san
diego
on
may
31st
of
1979,
you
would
have
seen
charles
r.
carney,
a
50-some-year-old
man,
approach
a
mexican
youth
in
the
area
of
downtown.
he
talked
with
the
young
boy,
and
then
he
and
the
boy
retreated
to
mr.
carney's
parked
vehicle,
which
was
in
a
parking
lot
on
the
corner
of
4th
and
g
streets
in
downtown
san
diego.
mr.
carney
and
the
boy
entered
the
vehicle
and
stayed
in
the
vehicle
for
approximately
an
hour
and
a
quarter.
agent
robert
williams
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration
witnessed
mr.
carney's
contact
with
the
young
man,
and
watched
mr.
carney
and
the
boy
go
into
the
vehicle.
he
noticed
the
license
plate
on
the
vehicle,
and
recalled
that
he
had
specific
information
regarding
this
vehicle.
specifically,
that
there
had
been
individuals
who
were
providing
young
boys
with
marijuana
or
drugs
in
exchange
for
sex
in
the
van;
and
that
typically
a
situation
would
involve
an
individual
and
a
young
boy
entering
the
van
for
a
period
of
10
minutes
to
2
hours,
and
then
they
would
exit
after
that
time.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
the
record
does
not
show
how
long
it
was
there,
your
honor.
there
was...
mr.
agent
williams
witnessed
the
vehicle
in
the
parking
lot
for
a
period
of
an
hour
and
a
quarter,
and
it
had
been
there
prior
at
various
times.
it
had
been
observed
in
the
parking
lot
at
that
place,
but
there
was
no
indication
that
it
was
at
any
time
permanently
attached
to
that
parking
lot.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
the
record
doesn't
specifically
say
that.
it
is,
however,
your
honor,
a
public
parking
lot
right
at
the
corner
of
4th
and
g
streets
in
downtown
san
diego.
it's
privately
owned,
as
i
believe
the
record
indicates.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
it
was
a
parking
lot
which
is
typically
populated
with
cars.
when
people
go
to
work
in
downtown,
they
will
pull
their
car
into
the
parking
lot
and
then
go
off
to
work,
come
back
after
work,
take
their
car,
and
drive
home.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
an
integral
vehicle
with
an
engine
and
wheels
and
a
back
portion.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that's
correct,
in
this
particular
instance.
after
an
hour
and
a
quarter,
agent
williams
noticed
the
young
boy
come
out
of
the
motor
home,
and
he
and
another
agent
followed
the
boy
and,
about
a
block
later,
stopped
the
boy
and
asked
him
what
had
been
going
on
in
the
motor
home.
the
young
boy
told
the
agents
that
he
had
received
a
small
bag
of
marijuana
in
exchange
for
allowing
the
man
to
perform
a
sexual
act
with
him.
at
that
point
in
time,
they
asked
the
boy
to
come
back
to
the
motor
home
with
them.
the
boy
did
that.
he
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
motor
home.
mr.
carney
stepped
out.
agent
clem
looked
into
the
motor
home,
saw
two
bags
of
a
green
leafy
substance
which
was
later
identified
to
be
marijuana
on
a
table
inside
the
motor
home,
saw
a
scale
on
the
table,
and
then
some
zip-lock
bags.
agent
clem
reported
what
he
saw
to
agent
williams,
who
placed
mr.
carney
under
arrest.
he
was
then
under
arrest.
the
agents
took
some
photographs
of
the
interior
of
the
van.
agent
williams
then
drove
the
van
to
the
narcotics
task
force
headquarters
in
national
city,
and
then
searched
the
van.
and
in
the
course
of
the
search,
they
found
a
total
of
about
two
pounds
of
marijuana
in
the
refrigerator
and
in
some
cupboards
in
addition
to
the
two
bags
that
were
found
on
the
table.
at
the
lower
court
level,
the
superior
court
held
a
statutory
motion
to
suppress
under
california
law.
the
superior
court
denied
the
motion
to
suppress.
following
the
denial
of
that
motion,
mr.
carney
entered
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere,
reserving
the
search
issue
for
appeal.
in
the
court
of
appeal
in
california,
the
judgment
was
affirmed.
the
order
of
probation
was
affirmed,
and
then
mr.
carney
petitioned
for
the
california
supreme
court
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that
was
dropped,
your
honor.
my
understanding
is
that
the
young
boy
was
a
mexican
national
and
he
was
not
to
be
found
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
so
there
was
no
evidence
to
proceed
with
on
that
particular
charge.
the
california
supreme
court
heard
the
case
and
reversed
the
order
of
probation,
and
subsequently
the
people
petitioned
this
court
to
hear
the
case.
the
people
asked
this
court
to
hear
the
case
because
there
is
a
need
for
bright
line
guidance
that
is
essential
to
ensure
the
proper
implementation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
proposition
doesn't
need
to
be
restated.
it's
been
emphasized
again,
and
again,
and
again
by
this
court
and
by
the
commentators,
that
to
ensure
the
proper
implementation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
we
have
to
provide
law
enforcement
officers
with
the
guidance
by
which
they
know
the
limits
of
their
power,
and
so
that
the
people
know
the
limits
of
their
protection.
if
you
will,
the
police
officers
are
the
workmen
in
the
scheme
of
the
law
enforcement.
they
are
the
carpenters,
and
they
are
the
plumbers,
and
they
are
the
electricians.
and
the
courts
are
the
architects.
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
ensure
that
the
workers
have
the
correct
plans
in
order
to
implement
the
building
of
the
law.
and
if
they
aren't
provided
with
the
plans,
then
the
building
that
they
implement...
the
building
that
they
build,
will
not
provide
adequate
protection
from
the
elements
outside.
so
it
is
essential
that
they
be
provided
with
bright
line
guidance,
and
guidance
which
is
workable.
for,
if
it
is
not
workable,
there
is
no
way
to
ensure
the
implementation.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
as
the
sole
limitation?
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
if
the
vehicle
has
wheels
on
it,
i
think
that
that
makes
it
mobile
and
it
would
be
subject
to
the
exception.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
i
think
i
would,
your
honor,
yes.
that
would
provide
a
bright
line.
but
i
am
looking
a
little
bit
more
beyond
just
wheels.
we
are
looking
for
self-locomotion,
self-propelling.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
not
at
all.
i
think
that
is
easily
attainable.
you
examine
a
vehicle,
and
if
it
objectively
appears
to
be
mobile,
if
that
thing
is
capable
of
movement,
then
you're
entitled
to
search
it
with
probable
cause.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
yes,
it
did,
your
honor,
and
that
was
one
of
the
ways
that
agent
williams
identified
this
particular
vehicle
as
the
one
that
was
referred
to
in
the
wetip
information
sheet
that
was
provided.
it
had
a
vehicle
registration,
and
in
fact
in
california
this
type
of
a
vehicle
requires
a
special
registration.
they
have
to
pay
more
money
in
order
to
get
it
on
the
road.
it
also
requires
that
the
individual
who
drives
this
vehicle
have
a
class
iii
driver's
license.
that's
a
special
kind
of
license
with
a
large
vehicle,
and
it
requires,
again,
a
larger
fee.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
i
didn't
read
the
entire
section
on
the
licensing
of
class
iii
to
determine
if
truck
drivers
were
involved.
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
close
analogy,
if
it's
not
right
on.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
not
in
total,
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general's
approach,
like
our
approach,
suggests
that
there
is
some
point
in
time
where
what
is
objectively
identifiable
as
a
vehicle
ceases
to
be
a
vehicle.
and
in
our
position,
we
would--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--if
it
still
has
its
wheels
and
it
still
has
its
engine,
it
is
capable
of
movement
and
it
is
capable
of
movement
very
quickly.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
well,
i'm
not
certain
that
we're
talking
about
the
same
thing,
then,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
mobile
home
parks
that
i
envision
are
prevalent
all
across
the
country.
what
is
generally
placed
in
a
mobile
home
park
is
a
trailer
that
has
wheels,
but
it
is
placed
upon
on
blocks--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--well,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
those
circumstances,
your
honor.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
society...
this
court
has
determined
that
society
is
not
willing
to
recognize
that
expectation
of
privacy
as
justifying
a
different
rule
from
another
motor
vehicle;
and
that,
because
of
its
mobility,
the
capacity
for
it
to
move--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--yes.
that
is
the
precise
area
where
our
approaches
are
different.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
well,
i
think
there
is
more
than
one,
and
i
think
they're
independent
of
one
another,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
under
the
circumstances
that's
been
presented,
yes,
i
would.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
and
if
i
might
address
the
solicitor
general's
position
and
explain
why
ours
is
a
little
bit
different:
the
reason
for
our
difference
with
the
solicitor
general
is
because
the
analysis
that's
required
in
the
solicitor
general's
approach
suffers
from
the
same
failures
as
the
california
supreme
court's.
that
is,
that
a
law
enforcement
officer
in
the
field
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
vehicle
is
now
placed
in
a
constitutionally
protected
parking
spot.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
typically
in
these
situations...
and
what
happened
in
this
particular
case...
is
that
an
individual
is
going
to
come
upon
this
vehicle
and
he's
not
going
to
know
whether
it's
been
parked
in
this
particular
motor
home
lot
for
a
period
of
three
months,
or
two
weeks,
or
how
long.
he'll
have
probable
cause.
he'll
be
asked
to
react
immediately.
and
under
those
circumstances,
he
won't
know
what
the
expectations
of
the
individuals
who
own
that
vehicle
are.
they
are
subjective
thoughts
the
officer
is
not
privy
to.
he
cannot
make
his
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
search
that
vehicle
based
upon
the
subjective
thoughts
of
the
individual
inside.
that's
another
reason
why
we
would
differ,
if
you
will,
with
the
solicitor
general's
approach,
which
we
feel
is
far
superior
to
that
of
the
california
supreme
court
or
to
that
that
has
been
proposed
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
but
the
problem
with
the
approach
is
twofold:
one,
it
requires
that
you
make
some
differentiation
between
a
vehicle
based
upon
configuration.
under
the
solicitor
general's
approach,
there
are
some
vehicles
which
have
the
capability
of
an
expectation
of
privacy
and
some
that
do
not.
that
requires
a
determination
by
an
officer.
then
secondly,
there
is
the
more
fundamental
problem
of
which
one
of
these
parking
spaces
is
or
is
not
entitled
to
the
added
protection.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
no,
i
don't
think
it
would,
your
honor,
because
it
would
be
more
or
less
like
the
suitcase.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
our
position
is
that
if
the
officer
looks
at
this
conveyance
and
determines
that
it
has
the
objective
indicia
of
mobility--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--self-propelled.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
yes.
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
not
when
it's
parked,
no.
when
it's
attached,
yes,
in
the
same
way
that
one
would--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--i
think
that
that
would
be
covered
under
the
exception
that
we
proposed.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
they
could
search
it
without
a
warrant--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--because
the
same
reasons
are
available
in
that
instance.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that
particular
vehicle
is
capable
of
movement,
and
it
is
capable
of
movement
very
quickly.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
the
motor
home
would
be
subject
to
search,
but
then
the
tent--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--not
the
tent,
not
under
this
particular
exception.
there
may
be
some
other
exception
that
would
allow
the
search
of
the
tent.
one
of
the
things
that
we
want
to
avoid
is
the
inherent
problems
in
determining
what
configurations
of
vehicles
are
subject
to
the
exception,
and
which
ones
are
not.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that's
right.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
it
doesn't
have
wheels.
[laughter]
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
it
is
moveable.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
well,
i
think
the
reasoning
does
apply.
but
again,
this
court
has
been
very
careful
in
drawing
the
lines
to
vehicles.
for
example,
the
suitcase
in
the
chadwick
case.
that's
capable
of
movement,
but
the
court
was
reluctant
to
apply
the
analysis
of
allowing
a
warrantless
search
of
the
suitcase.
however,
when
the
suitcase
is
placed
into
the
trunk
of
a
car,
or
placed
into
the
cab
of
a
car,
and
the
probable
cause
arises
afterwards,
the
suitcase
is
subject
to
search.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
we
asked
that
the
officers
not
be
required
to
make
that
evaluation,
because
we
don't
think
that
they're
equipped
to
do
it,
for
one.
secondly,
i
think
that
this
court
has
already
done
the
analysis
for
them.
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that's
correct.
and
although
california
has
a
bright
line
test
by
saying
motor
homes
cannot
be
searched,
they
don't
define
what
a
motor
home
is.
so
their
bright
line
is
very
fuzzy,
i
would
suggest,
since
they
have
not
defined
their
term.
we
think
that
mobility
provides
the
bright
line.
if
i
might
get
back
to
the
point
i
was
about
to
make
in
terms
of
the
privacy
interests,
that
in
the
carroll
case
in
1925,
chief
justice
taft
analyzed
the
particular
vehicles
that
were
applied.
in
particular,
of
course,
carroll
involved
an
automobile.
but
he
found
it
significant
not
to
differentiate
between
an
automobile,
and
a
wagon,
and
a
ship,
and
a
motorboat,
yet
the
ship,
the
wagon,
and
the
motorboat
are
clearly
capable
of
serving
a
residential
function.
yet
they
were
not
to
be
treated
any
differently
than
an
automobile,
because
both
of
those
things,
all
of
those
conveyances,
had
the
ability
to
move.
and
it
was
that
ability
to
move
which
caused
the
privacy
expectations
to
yield
to
the
exigency
created
therein.
as
i
believe
it
is
footnote
8
in
the
ross
opinion
suggests,
that
if
you
give
probable
cause
to
believe
that
you're
transporting
contraband
in
a
vehicle,
then
you're
not
entitled
to
the
added
protection
that
a
warrant
provides
if
there
is
probable
cause.
and
of
course
the
probable
cause
determination
is
going
to
be
evaluated
by
a
magistrate
at
some
point
in
time
anyway.
the
question
is,
are
we
going
to
provide
the
added
protection
of
the
magistrate
evaluation
before
the
search
or
after
the
search.
and
of
course
if
the
probable
cause
analysis
by
the
officer
was
faulty,
that
evidence
is
going
to
be
lost
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
there
will
not
be
any...
certainly
there
will
be
an
inconvenience
to
the
party
because
of
the
unlawful
search,
but
he
will
not
suffer
a
criminal
ramification
as
a
result
of
that.
the
protections
are
provided
under
that
situation,
and
we
think
that
that's
a
good
place
to
draw
the
line
because
it
is
capable
of
being
properly
enforced,
and
it
is
capable
of
a
bright
line
approach.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
certainly
we
are.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
and
it
is
certainly
preferable,
your
honor.
i
am
not
going
to
argue
whether
it
is
preferable
or
not
to
have
the
probable
cause
determination
first,
because
of
course
it
is.
but
the
exigency
created
by
mobility...
and
indeed
all
of
the
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement...
are
based
upon
the
probability
that
you
can't
get
the
warrant
beforehand
and
ensure
that
the
other
policies
of
the
fourth
amendment,
ensuring
the
public
safety
and
the
safety
of
the
officers,
will
be
implemented.
that
is
what
the
reasonable
approach
entails.
and
i
think
chief
justice
taft
talked
about
the
rule.
what
he
said
is,
it's
a
wise
one
because
it
leaves
the
rule
one
which
is
easily
applied
and
understood
and
is
uniform.
and
that
is
what
we
are
proposing:
a
uniform
rule.
and
it's
really
not
the
rule
that
the
california
courts,
or
the
california
attorney
general's
office
is
proposing.
it's
the
rule
that
this
court
has
articulated
and
rearticulated
in
carroll,
and
chambers,
and
ross.
and
we
are
asking
that
it
be
applied
to
all
vehicles,
regardless
of
their
configuration,
or
regardless
of
what
the
people
who
are
driving
those
vehicles
think.
i
mean,
what
they
expect
personally
is
really
not
terribly
important,
because
there
is
no
way
to
confirm
those
facts
objectively.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
a
houseboat?
i
think
that
would
be
covered,
and
i
think
that
the--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--no,
it's
a
vessel,
and
it
is
covered
by
the
same
rule.
in
fact,
the
circuit
courts
have
dealt
with
ship
cases
in
the
past,
and
they
have
applied
the
carroll
reasoning
to
a
vessel
because
of
its
inherent
mobility,
as
well.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that's
correct.
it's
sort
of
like
an
automobile
that
is
parked
right
next
to
the
house
in
the
driveway.
the
automobile
might
not
be
covered,
and
the
house
is.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
no.
there
may
be
oars.
there
may
be
some
way
to
move
that
from
one
place
to
another.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
as
have
i.
i've
passed
a
few
of
them
on
the
beltway.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
certainly.
again,
the
objective
indicia
of
mobility
would
be
what
the
officers
are
looking
to.
perhaps
in
your
honor's
example,
they
would
be
looking
to
see
if
there's
oars
there.
there's
no
motor.
there's
no
way
to
move
that
thing.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
if
the
officer
doesn't
know
that,
i
don't
see
why
he
should
be
called
to
that
particular
knowledge.
one
thing
he
does
know
about
when
he
is
dealing
with
a
house--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--people
choose
to
live
where
they
want
to
live.
there
are
some
risks
associated
with
where
one
will
live.
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
don't
have
the
expectation
of
privacy
someone
else
does
unless
they
do
something
to
black
out
the
glass,
to
prevent
people
from
looking
in;
but
they
choose
to
live
there.
and
individuals
may
choose
to
live
in
a
recreational
vehicle,
or
a
houseboat,
or
something
else,
but
when
they
make
that
choice
it
is
a
conscious
choice,
because
they've
been
on
notice
that
ever
since
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment,
if
a
vehicle
or
vessel
has
been
used
to
transport
contraband
or
evidence,
it's
been
subject
to
seizure
and
subsequent
search
without...
with
probable
cause,
without
a
magistrate's
prior
approval.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
well,
i
would
suggest
that
perhaps
there's
not.
coolidge
is
not
a
good
case
for
a
number
of
reasons,
i
think.
you
know,
coolidge
was
more
of
a
warrant
case
than
it
really
was
an
automobile
case.
and
once
the
warrant
failed
because
it
wasn't
issued
by
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
they
went
through
all
the
possible
reasons
to
justify
the
search
of
that
vehicle,
and
they
didn't
find
any
in
that
particular
case.
i
note
that
the
coolidge
court
was
unable
to
garner
a
majority
of
this
court.
i
think
that
the
ross
case--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
ross
case
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
coolidge,
and
that
there
is--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--that's
true,
it
was
not.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
but
the
analysis
of
ross
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
coolidge.
also,
i
might
add
that
in
coolidge
the
officers
knew
about
that
particular
car
for
a
long
period
of
time.
in
fact,
they
knew
about
it
for
long
enough
to
get
the
warrant
from
the
attorney
general,
which
was
not
issued
by
a
neutral
magistrate
and
therefore
invalid.
they
had
prior
knowledge
about
that.
it
wasn't
the
situation
where
they
came
upon
it
suddenly
and
were
faced
with
a
situation
where
they
had
to
decide
what
to
do
right
now.
in
that
particular
case,
this
court
found
that
it
was
an
improper
search
under
any
number
of
reasons,
including
that
it
was
improper
under
the
vehicle
exception.
i
see
the
light
is
on,
so
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
rebuttal,
the
state
of
california
would
like
to
advance
four
positions.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
specifics
in
this
particular
case,
counsel
has
referred
to
the
living
compartment
in
this
case
as
supporting
the
residential
purpose.
but
the
record
does
not
at
all
support
this
particular
assertion.
and
in
particular,
if
one
examines
the
photographs
that
are
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
that
were
submitted
to
this
court,
looking
at
the
picture
of
the
refrigerator
will
show
that
there
is
marijuana
in
the
refrigerator,
but
there
is
no
food.
and
when
they
examined
the
cupboards
in
this
case,
there's
no
underwear,
there's
no
sheets,
there's
marijuana.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
mr.
carney
was
using
this
as
his
home,
and
in
fact
that
is
the
problem.
there
is
no
way
to
determine,
in
these
particular
class
of
vehicles,
when
they
are
and
are
not
being
utilized
as
a
home,
objectively.
secondly,
justice
marshall's
concern
with
the
cadillac
stretch
car
points
out
the
flaw
in
the
reasoning
of
the
respondent,
because
it
is
our
impression
that
more
people
in
this
country
live
in
cars
and
live
in
pickup
trucks.
the
poor
people
that
can't
afford
motor
homes
live
in
those
vehicles.
more
of
them
live
there
than
live
in
motor
homes,
which
are
typically
more
expensive.
yet
they
are
to
be
accorded
a
different
expectation
of
privacy
merely
because
they
can't
afford
the
trappings
that
a
motor
home
would
provide
them
with.
i
think
that
that's
an
unfair
application
of
the
rule.
thirdly,
the
definition
that
mr.
homann
gives
with
regard
to
house
cars.
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
use
that
term
in
the
carney
opinion.
they
talked
about
"motor
homes".
they
didn't
talk
about
"house
cars".
that
definition
was
not
promulgated
to
apply
to
search
and
seizure
law.
that
definition
was
promulgated
in
order
to
register
these
vehicles
and
to
show
that
those
vehicles
would
be
accorded
a
certain
registration
fee,
and
that
in
certain
circumstances,
particularly
when
there
is
open
alcohol
containers,
that
an
individual
that
has
that
container
in
the
back
is
not
going
to
be
cited
for
that
particular
violation.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
well,
the
vehicle--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--right.
it
does
have
a
special
license.
but
i
might
add
that
the
vehicle
code
section
that
the
california
supreme
court
refers
to
is
not
the
code
section
defining
"house
car".
it's
a
different
code
section
that
defines
"mobile
home".
and
the
house
car
section
is
section
3.84,
i
believe,
of
the
vehicle
code,
and
3.62
of
the
vehicle
code
is
the
house
car
definition.
i
might
also
add
that
the
legislature
has
also
determined
that,
for
purposes
of
burglary,
that
the
burglary
of
a
residence
is
burglary
in
the
first
degree
in
california.
yet
the
burglary
of
a
house
car
or
an
automobile,
it
lumps
it
into
the
category
of
second
degree
burglary.
they
don't
provide
that
with
the
trappings
of
a
residence
in
the
penal
code,
even
if
there
may
be
some
provision
in
the
vehicle
code
determining...
with
licensing
involved.
and
finally,
if
police
officers
are
going
to
be
allowed
to
ensure
that
a
vehicle
does
not
move,
if
they
are
going
to
be
able
to
get
the
evidence
in
there,
they
have
to
be
allowed
to
seize
it.
it
has
to
be
stopped.
and
once
that
seizure
is
made,
this
court
has
determined
in
the
past
that
there
is
no
difference
constitutionally
between
seizing
and
holding
that
vehicle
while
one
awaits
for
a
warrant,
and
subjecting
it
to
an
immediate
search
at
the
officer's
option.
there
is
a
reason
for
that
difference.
different
policy
provisions
come
into
play
once
you
seize
and
hold.
because
at
that
point
in
time,
if
one
is
to
require
the
officers
to
hold
the
vehicle
while
awaiting
a
warrant,
they
are
going
to
be
subjected
to
danger;
they
are
going
to
be
subjected
to
the
possibility
that--
mr.
louis
r.
hanoian
--thank
you,
your
honor.
