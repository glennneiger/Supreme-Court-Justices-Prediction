chief
justice
burger
how
long
was
this
vehicle
on
the
parking
lot?
chief
justice
burger
did
this
vehicle
have
a
motor
vehicle
license
on
it
issued
by
the
state
of
california?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
something
like
a
truck
driver's
license.
chief
justice
burger
but
not
quite
that
high?
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
inquiry
there
might
be,
did
it
come
in
in
the
afternoon
and
hock
up
with
the
electricity
and
so
forth,
but
leave
the
following
morning
if
there
was
drug
activity,
drug
sales
activity
suspected.
then
the
attachment
to
the
electric
power
would
be
less
significant
than
if
they
were
there
all
winter,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested.
chief

e.
burger
you
may.
mr.
homann.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
we
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
they
don't
let
people
stay
indefinitely
on
a
parking
lot
in
downtown
san
diego?
chief
justice
burger
you
think
we
can't
take
judicial
notice?
chief
justice
burger
those
exceptions
you
mentioned
do
not
have
the
factor
which
has
distinguished
the
mobility.
hasn't
it
been
constantly
in
all
the
cases
the
mobility
of
the
vehicle
that
is
the
basis
for
the
exception?
chief
justice
burger
in
any
event,
chadwick
involved
a
trunk
that
it
took
two
men
to
lift.
that
isn't
terribly
mobile,
is
it?
chief
justice
burger
it
has
no
wheels.
chief
justice
burger
assume
now
that
justice
wright's
automobile
vehicle
is
the
tractor
that
would
pull
the
otherwise
immobile
motor
home,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
now
you
could
search
the
tractor,
but
not
the--
chief
justice
burger
--the
tractor
can
take
off
down
the
street
and
go
70
miles
an
hour
on
the
highway?
chief
justice
burger
well,
they're
equally...
when
they're
attached,
they're
equally
moveable,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
burger
the
other
one
isn't
used
for
transportation
in
the
abstract,
but
only
in
connection
with
what
it
pulls.
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
burger
people
don't
go
out
on
the
highway
on
the
tractor
alone,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
hanoian?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
