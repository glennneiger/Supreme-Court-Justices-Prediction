you
prefer
a
single
rationale
for
the
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
namely,
you
think
"mobility"
is
practically
the
sole
criteria;
and
the
solicitor
general
at
least
thinks
that
there
are
two.
justice
white
well,
anyway,
you
certainly
would
differ
with
the
solicitor
general
as
to
the
application
of
the
exception
in
a
park,
in
a
mobile
home
park?
justice
white
of
course
that
isn't
the
issue
here,
is
it?
this
is
in
a
public
parking
lot.
justice
white
so
you
would
say
that
if
there's
a
car,
if
there
had
been
a
car
parked
alongside
the
motor
home
in
this
case
in
the
same
parking
lot
and
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
search
them
both,
they
could
enter
the
car
but
not
the
motor
home?
justice
white
the
possible
mobility
or
the
potential
mobility
doesn't
override
the
privacy
interests?
justice
white
but
it
does...
as
soon
as
the
mobility
becomes
mobility,
it
overrides
it?
justice
white
well,
it
isn't
theoretical.
it's
something
more
than
potential.
justice
white
because
you
know
that
very
soon
it's
going
to
move.
it's
not
going
to
stay
there
very
long.
