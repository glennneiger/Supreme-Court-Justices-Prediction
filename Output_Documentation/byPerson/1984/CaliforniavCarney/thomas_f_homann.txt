mr.
thomas
f.
homann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
physical
entry
of
the
living
compartment,
the
residential
area
of
the
motor
home
which
was
parked
for
an
unknown
but
extended
period
of
time
in
a
parking
lot.
unfortunately,
and
not
withstanding
mr.
hanoian's
representation
to
which
i
know
to
be
accurate,
the
character
of
that
particular
parking
lot
does
not
appear
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
the
location
does.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
i'm
not
sure
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
that
they
don't.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
i
would
think
not.
the
motor
home
was
parked;
the
drapes
were
closed.
it
contained
upholstered
furniture.
it
contained
a
table,
kitchen
features,
a
refrigerator.
it
contained
all
of
the
indicia
of
a
home.
the
time
of
the
entry
was
on
a
thursday
afternoon,
a
working
day.
the
motor
home
was
parked
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
courthouse.
it's
the
main
courthouse
in
san
diego.
over
60
magistrates
were
available
there
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
issue
the
warrant
if
a
proper
showing
had
been
made.
rather
than
seeking
the
authorization
of
the
warrant
before
entering
into
the
residential
compartment
of
the
vehicle,
the
officers
entered
themselves.
this
is
not
a
case
like
united
states
against
ross
involving
search
of
a
passenger
car,
or
indeed
of
any
vehicle
which
was
stopped
while
speeding
down
the
highway,
with
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it
was
transporting
contraband.
in
this
case
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
particular
motor
home
was
ever
used
to
transport
contraband.
there
is
indications
that
it
was
used
as
a
distribution
point,
but
not
that
it
was
used
for
transporting
contraband,
and
i
think
that
is
somewhat
key.
perhaps
i
read
united
states
against
ross
too
narrowly,
but
the
court
over
and
over
again
in
the
opinion
mentions
and
reiterates
the
fact
that
the
car
was
stopped
while
transporting
contraband
on
an
open
highway.
the
entire
genesis
and
development
of
the
automobile
exception
from
carroll
on
forward
i
think
has
frequently,
if
not
always,
turned
on
the
fact
of
mobility
in
the
context
of
a
car
stopped
on
a
highway.
carroll
itself,
of
course,
involved
the
oldsmobile
roadster
speeding
down
the
highway--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--the
possibility
of
movement
was--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--was
good
enough.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
there
was
no
possibility
of
movement
after
the
driver,
the
only
occupant
of
the
motor
home,
left
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--the
motor
home
was
inoperable.
there
had
been
curtains
closed
across
the
front...
the
front
of
the...
the
front
of
the
vehicle
itself.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
but
there
was
no
one
there.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
at
least
the
california
supreme
court
found
that
the
police
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
anyone
there.
as
long
as
there
was
no
one
there,
the
fact
of
the...
the
mobility
factor
itself
was
substantially
diminished
when
it's
parked,
when
it's
inoperable
at
least
by
virtue
of
the
curtains
across
the
front
windshield,
when
there's
on
one
there
to
drive
it
down
the
street.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
that's
correct.
he
had
been
in
it.
he
was
not
under
arrest
at
that
time
and
the
motor
home
had
not
been
searched
at
that
point.
he
came
out
and,
at
that
time,
officer--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--once
he
came
out,
there
was
no
one
else
in
there,
though.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
we
have
suggested
that
they
go
get
a
warrant
at
that
point.
the
whole
issue
of
probable
cause,
which
as
i...
i
agree
not
raised
here,
we
have
consistently
contested
all
the
way
up
through
the
courts--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--well,
the
officers
themselves
never
attempted
to
arrest
mr.
carney
until
after
the
entry
was
made
and
after
they
saw
the
marijuana
on
the
table.
the
issue
of
whether
they
needed
a
warrant
to
get
mr.
carney
out
of
the
motor
home
has
not
been
raised.
my
only
contention
is,
before
they
actually
made
the
physical
entry
into
the
living
compartment,
that
a
warrant
would
have
been
required.
the
attorney
general's
argument,
and
the
rule
that
they
propose
i
think
is
insufficiently
sensitive
to
the
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy.
the
central
purpose
of
a
fourth
amendment,
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
on
numerous
occasions,
is
to
protect
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy.
an
automobile
is
one
item,
but
a
home
has
always
been
treated
differently.
society
has
traditionally
recognized
the
greatest
of
privacy
interests
and
privacy
rights
in
the
sanctity
of
a
person's
home,
even
if
it's
only
a
temporary
home.
the
tent,
i
agree
with
mr.
hanoian,
is
entitled
to
be
free
from
warrantless
seizure,
warrantless
search,
unless
there
has
been
a
warrant
issued,
or
unless
there
is
some
genuine
need
to
enter
it.
likewise,
i
think
the
motel
room,
which
the
court
has
recognized
as
a
place
entitled
to
the
dignity
equivalent
to
that
of
a
home,
cannot
be
entered
without
a
warrant.
here
also
we
have--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--not
in
all
the
cases,
your
honor.
the
example
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
cady
v.
dombrowski,
i
believe,
where
the
automobile
had
been
in
a
crash
and
was
inoperable
at
the
time
that
it
was
subjected
to
the
warrantless
search.
so
certainly
mobility
has
not
been
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
automobile
exception.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
mobility
itself,
though,
apart
from
an
automobile,
has
never
been
a
justification
for
all
warrantless
searches.
the
example
that
we
always
rely
on
is
the
trunk
in
the
chadwick
case,
for
instance.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
in
many
respects
it
was
not
closer
to
an
automobile.
i
think
if
we
look--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--pardon
me?
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
well,
insofar
as
the
motor
home
contains
dresser
drawers,
cabinets,
all
sorts
of
intimate
personal
items
that
one
ordinarily
carries
around
in
a
trunk
or
a
suitcase,
they
certainly
also
carry
them
around
in
the
storage
compartments
of--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--i
don't
mean
a
trunk
of
a
car.
i
mean
the
trunk,
as
in
united
states
against
chadwick.
and
in
chadwick,
even
though
the
trunk
was
mobile,
the
expectations
of
privacy
were
considered
to
outweigh
the
necessity
for
an
immediate
entry,
warrantless
entry
of
the
trunk.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
it's
my
understanding
that
chadwick
is
still
good
law,
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
it's
not
terrifically
mobile,
but
it
is--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--it
has
no
wheels,
but
it's
still
designed
to
be
transported
from
one
place
to
another.
the
purpose
of
the
trunk
is
to
move
things.
so
in
that
respect,
it
is
similar
to
the
motor
home.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
it
comes
closer
to
a
home,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
necessarily
satisfies
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
i
think
what
they
want
is
some
kind
of...
in
the
first
instance,
some
kind
of
outward
indicia
that
it
is
capable
of
being
used,
or
is
designed
to
be
used
as--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--does
it
have
a
bed?
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
if
it
is
reasonably
objectively
observable
that
it
has
the
attributes
of
a
home
in
it,
then
i
think
we
have
to
give
it
those...
i
think
we
have
to
give
it
the
same
protections
that
we
ordinarily
give
dwelling
compartments.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
i'm
satisfied
that
it
would
be,
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
i
have
a
harder
time
saying
it
would
be
a
home.
what
you
have
to
look
at,
i
think,
first
of
all...
and
under
the
california
supreme
court's
analysis...
what
you
look
at
first
is
what
it
looks
like.
if
it
looks
like
it's
a
motor
home,
and
i
can
tell
the
difference
between
a
ford
ltd
and
a
motor
home,
then
i
think
you
have
to
give
it
the
respect
that
a
home
is
due.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
doesn't
look
like
one,
but
if
it's
being
used
as
a
home,
if
it's
being
used
as
residential
purposes,
you're
sleeping
in
it,
whatever,
then
i
think
the
person
has
exhibited
the
kind
of
expectations
of
privacy
in
it
that
are
going
to
make
a
police
officer's
warrantless
entry
a
little
more
suspect,
a
little
more
suspect
at
least--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--the
motor
home
in
this
case
i
can
moderately
describe.
it
has
trailers.
it's
large
enough
to
stand
up
in.
it
looks
like
a
trailer-trailer
type
walls.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
it
looks
like
a
trailer,
rather.
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
it
is
a
self-contained
single
unit.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
a
cab
in
front,
and
a
door
into
the
living
compartment
and
the
rear,
which
was
where
the
entry
was
made
in
this
case;
and
curtains,
upholstered
furniture,
kitchen
facilities.
frequently
motor
homes
have
bathrooms.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
i
think
ordinarily
it
is
obvious.
it
becomes
a
closer
question,
of
course,
when
we
see
a
van,
for
instance,
which
could
have
the
acoutrements
of
a
home,
but
which
are
not
obvious
from
the
outside
that
it
contains
those
kinds
of
features.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
under
my
test,
i
think
that
once
it
becomes
obvious
to
the
police
that
it
is
being
used
for
residential
purposes
as
opposed
to
being
used
for
transportation,
then
i
think
you
have
to
look
to
determine
whether
there
is
exigency
which
justifies
the
entry
or
not.
and
if
there
was
no
exigency,
then
a
warrant
would
be
required.
that
is
of
course
the
bottom
line
on
my
test.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
all
of
the
indicia
of
a
home
are
not
present
when
it's
a
sleeping
bag
in
the
back
of
a
van.
among
other
things,
i
think
that
the
compartments
for
storing
personal
items
are
somewhat
key
to
a
determination
that
it
is
being
used
residentially.
the
kitchen
features
are
significant.
the
fact
that
it's
got
a
bed
is
also
significant.
the
fact
that
it
can
be
closed
off
from
view
with
curtains
i
think
is
important,
thereby
exhibiting
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
world
is
being
shut
out
when
one
goes
inside.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
the
covered
wagon
problem...
perhaps
i'm
not
as
familiar
with
my
history
as
i
ought
to
be.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
covered
wagons
were
used
for
to
transport
the
items,
and
that
you
slept
outside
around
the
campfire
rather
than
in
the
covered
wagon.
but
insofar
as
the
covered
wagon
served
or
functioned
as
a
person's
temporary
residence
while
they
were
making
the
treck
across
the
country,
then
i
think
we
have
to
give
it
at
least
some
of
the
dignity
that
we
give
a
home.
certainly
the
covered
wagon,
even
when
it
is
traveling
along
the
trail,
is
a
repository
for
all
of
the
personal
effects.
and
unless
there's
a
need,
i
doubt
that
we
would
want
the
police
to
be
able
to
rummage
through
all
of
those
items,
as
in
this
case
they
did
when
they
rummaged
through
all
of
the
cabinets
and
the
cupboards
without
first
obtaining
the
authorization
of
the
warrant.
i
think
that
the
critical
question
here
is
whether
an
invariable
and
automatic
application
of
the
vehicle
exception
to
all
vehicles,
without
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
how
they're
being
used,
without
regard
to
any
expectations
of
privacy
in
the
vehicles;
because
ultimately
i
think
that
the
state
attorney
general's
position
here
is
the
privacy
interests
in
this
vehicle
should
be
totally
disregarded,
that
it
has
no
part
in
the
analysis
of
whether
the
item
should
be
searched,
whether
the
court
should
ignore
all
of
those
interests
and
sacrifice
what
i
think
are
important
fourth
amendment
privacy
protections
merely
for
the
sake
of
police
expediency
and
police
convenience,
for
the
sake
of
the
bright
line
rule.
let
me
talk
about
the
privacy
interests
just
briefly.
the
court
i
think
in
a
number
of
decisions
has
pointed
out
various
factors
in
a
passenger
vehicle
which
diminish
the
expectation
of
privacy,
and
which
at
least
help
justify
an
automobile
exception.
among
other
things,
a
passenger
car's
function
is
principally
transportation.
that
is
also
true
of
a
motor
home,
the
type
of
vehicle
which
was
involved
here.
however,
transportation
is
not
its
sole
function,
whereas
a
passenger
automobile,
it's
principal
function,
if
not
its
exclusive
function,
is
transportation.
here,
the
vehicle
is
stopped.
the
vehicle
is
used
for
sleeping,
for
all
sorts
of
intimate
activities.
the
public
nature
of
automobile
travel
and
the
visibility
of
the
occupants
in
an
automobile
are
said
to
diminish
expectations
of
privacy
in
a
passenger
automobile.
that's
not
true
in
the
passenger
compartment
of
a
motor
home.
the
private
passenger
automobile
is
not
ordinarily
used
as
a
repository
of
personal
effects.
i
have
already
addressed
that.
as
far
as
a
motor
home
is
involved,
it
does
involve
a
repository
for
personal
effects.
the
configuration
of
a
passenger
automobile
is
a
factor
that
the
court
has
suggested
diminishes
expectations
of
privacy.
the
configuration
of
a
motor
home
is
designed
to
ensure
privacy
in
many
respects.
and
finally,
and
i
guess
most
significantly,
the
court
has
noted
that
a
car
seldom
serves
as
one's
home,
and
i
think
that's
true,
even
though
it
is
possible
to
live
in
a
stretch
limousine.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
i
think
that's
true.
a
van
ordinarily
would
not
be
subject
to
the
motor
home
exception.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
and
i
think
that
once
it
becomes
obvious
to
searching
police
officers
that
the
item
is
being
used
as
a
home
for
its
residential
purposes,
then
i
think
the
search
has
to
be...
the
search
has
to
be
limited.
ordinarily,
the
situation
in
which
i
would
anticipate
that
would
arise,
the
police
officers--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--that
helps
me
tremendously.
that
helps
me
tremendously,
because
the
rule
that
i've
proposed
at
least
is
not
going
to
preclude
the
police
from
entering
the
van
or
the
motor
home,
for
that
matter,
when
it
is
speeding
down
the
highway
in
most
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
i
think
that
if
the
van--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--if
the
van
was
being
moved,
then
i
think
that
a
real
danger
of
loss
or
destruction
of
evidence
would
have
been
presented,
assuming
they
had
probable
cause
to
get
in,
and
they
probably
could
have
searched
it
without
a
warrant
if
it
was
moving,
if
there
was
a
danger
that
it
was
going
to
be
lost.
that's
all...
under
current
law--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--ordinarily,
the
mobility
factor
when
it
actually
comes
into
play,
when
the
vehicle
believed
to
contain
contraband
is
being
moved,
there
is
a
need
for
an
immediate
search
at
that
point
because
there
is
a
genuine
danger
that
the
evidence
is
going
to
be
lost.
here
that
is
not
what
was
happening.
there
was
no
danger
that
the
vehicle
was
going
to
be
moved.
it
was
parked.
the
windshield
was
covered,
and
there
was
no
real
danger
that
the
evidence
would
be
lost.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
i
think
that
once
the
key
is
in
the
ignition,
once
the
vehicle
starts
or
advances
into
its
use
as
a
vehicle,
as
opposed
to
its
use
as
a
use
in
its
residential
qualities,
then
i
think
there
is
sufficient
exigency,
there
is
a
real
necessity
to
dispense
with
the
warrant
requirement
at
that
time.
if
the
police
officers
have
reason
to
believe
that
evidence
inside
the
house
is
being
destroyed,
they
can
obviously
enter
the
house
without
a
warrant.
and
i
think
the
same
thing
applies
when
the
vehicle
starts
to
move.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
yes.
i
like
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
and
i
agree
that
there
is
more
than
one
position
in
there.
that
is
essentially
what
i
am--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
exactly.
the
expectations
of
privacy
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
in
the
automobile
are
substantially
less
than
what
we
would--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--the
privacy
interest
overcomes--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--as
soon
as
the
mobility
becomes
something
more
than
theoretical
or
hypothetical
mobility--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--all
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
i
think
that's
true.
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--the
reason
is,
the
tractor
has
a
privacy
interest
which
society
is
less
prepared
to
recognize.
it's
a
diminished
privacy
expectation,
as
opposed
to
the
motor
home
or
the
trailer
itself.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
exactly.
but
one
is
used
for
private
living
residential
purposes,
and
the
other
is
used
for
transportation.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
f.
homann
ordinarily
not.
the
tractor
partakes
more
of
the
automobile,
because
it
doesn't
have...
it
is
not
the
kind
of
repository
for
personal
effects.
it's
not
surrounded
by
glass.
the
glass
house
illustration
is
good
here.
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
shouldn't
have
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy,
and
the
cab
is
surrounded
by
glass.
but
the
motor
home
is
not.
it
is
surrounded
by
curtains,
which
were
designed
specifically
to
ensure
expectations
of
privacy.
i
want
to
speak
to
the
bright
line
rules
very
briefly,
because
i've
mentioned
in
the
brief
that
i
think
the
california
police
officers,
at
least,
and
i
suspect
others
as
well,
are
currently
required
to
distinguish
between
"motor
homes"
and
"passenger
automobiles"
between
the
living
quarters
of
what
the
california
vehicle
code
defines
as
a
"house
car".
a
house
car
is
a
vehicle
which
has
either
been
designed
or
permanently
altered
for
human
habitation.
the
importance
of
the
definition
that
they
have
adopted
in
the
california
vehicle
code
is
this:
that
it
is
a
criminal
offense
to
possess
an
open
container
of
alcoholic
beverage,
to
consume
an
alcoholic
beverage
in
a
vehicle,
except
in
the
living
quarters
of
what
the
legislature
defines
as
a
house
car.
this
is
a
criminal
law
that
the
california
state
police
officers
are
currently
required
to
enforce
on
an
everyday
basis.
they
can,
and
i
think
that
it's
reasonable
to
expect
them
to
distinguish
between
what
is
a
motor
home,
what
is
being
used
as
residential
quarters,
and
what
is
not.
the
rule
that
i
suggest
is
that
before
warrantless
entry
of
a
motor
home
can
be
accomplished,
there
must
be
some
showing
of
a
genuine
need,
more
than
a
theoretical
need.
i
agree
that
ordinarily,
and
in
most
circumstances,
that
need
is
going
to
be
easily
demonstrated
by
police.
the
two
ninth
circuit
cases
involving
motor
homes
which
were
stopped
on
a
highway
where
the
ninth
circuit
refused
to
apply
the
automobile
exception
to
justify
the
searches,
in
both
of
those
cases,
williams
and
wiga,
the
police
ultimately
were
justified
in
making
their
warrantless
entry
on
another
basis
other
than
the
automobile
exception.
the
point
is
this:
there
is
no
need
for
an
automobile
exception
if
none
of
the
justifications
and
none
of
the
reasons
for
its
necessity
are
present.
if
the
motor
home
is
traveling
down
the
highway,
if
it's
likely
that
evidence
is
going
to
be
lost,
if
it's
going
to
explode,
if
the
officers
need
to
enter
it
for
their
own
safety,
existing
law
permits
them
to
do
that
even
if
we
apply
ordinary
holmes
rules
to
the
case.
the
interests
at
stake,
the
interests
in
the
privacy
of
a
home-like
place
even
if
it's
on
wheels,
i
think
require
a
higher
showing
than
the
relaxed
standard
which
has
justified
warrantless
searches
of
automobiles
in
most
circumstances.
thank
you.
