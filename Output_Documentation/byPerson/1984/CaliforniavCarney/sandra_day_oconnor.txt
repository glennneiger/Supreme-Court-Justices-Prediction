justice
o'connor
mr.
hanoian,
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
case
and
suggests
apparently
a
somewhat
different
approach
than
you
are
urging,
and
an
approach
that
would
suggest
that
under
some
circumstances
a
mobile
home
could
result
in
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
could
be
respected.
do
you
reject
that
approach?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
vehicle
is
in
one
of
these
mobile
home
parks
and
hooked
up
to
water
and
electricity
but
still
has
its
wheels
on?
justice
o'connor
even
though
the
people
are
living
in
it
as
a
home
and
are
paying
rent
for
the
trailer
space,
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
well,
there
are
places
where
people
can
plug
into
water,
and
electricity,
and
do.
there
are
many
places,
for
example,
in
the
state
i
came
from
where
people
go
and
spend
the
winter
in
a
mobile
home.
and
you
think
there
would
be
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
such
circumstances?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
your
approach
and
that
offered
by
the
solicitor
general
were
rather
different
in
that
area.
justice
o'connor
but
not
the
tent.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
hanoian,
i
guess
we
didn't
authorize...
the
court
didn't
authorize
that
in
coolidge
v.
new
hampshire
where
justice
stewart,
writing
for
the
court,
said
we
attach
no
constitutional
significance
to
the
mobility
of
the
vehicle.
now
is
there
any
life
left
to
coolidge?
