mr.
marvin
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
the
second
circuit
decided
in
this
case
was
that
the
only
two
grounds
offered
by
the
village
for
denial
of
access
to
the
creche
were
invalid.
the
first
ground
which
the
village
offered
was
the
establishment
clause.
the
second
circuit,
i
submit
correctly,
held
that
that
argument
could
not
survive
lynch.
the
second
argument
made
by
the
village
in
the
second
circuit
and
made
explicitly
in
its
brief
was
that
even
if
the
establishment
clause
was
not
an
adequate
justification
for
denial
of
access,
then
the
village
could
not
be
required
to
post
and
to
permit
controversial
device,
sectarian
symbol.
the
second
circuit
made
no
mention
in
its
opinion
of
that
second
ground
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
ground
is
so
devoid
of
constitutional
merit
that
it
takes
ingenuity
and
a
facility
and
forensic
skills
such
as
only
my
friend
possesses
to
advance
it.
it
is
significant,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
only
effort
to
express
a
point
of
view
which
has
been
denied
by
the
village
of
scarsdale
for
its
park,
the
only
effort
to
express
which
has
been
denied
access
is
the
creche.
for
more
than
25
years
every
application
to
display
an
unattended
symbol
in
scarsdale's
parks
has
been
granted
or
the
village
trustees
have
directed
the
use
of
a
part
of
the
park
system
other
than
boniface
circle.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
that
would
depend,
sir,
upon
several
circumstances.
i
agree
that
the
village
could
impose
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
but
it
would
first
of
all
have
to
be
content
neutral.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
and,
secondly,
it
would
have
to
justify
a
significant
governmental
interest.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
what
could
the
village
do
if
this
court
affirm?
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
doubt
very
much,
sir,
that
this
village
could
deny
access
to
all
of
its
parks
for
symbols
and
signs
of
all
kinds.
i
find
it
difficult
to
perceive
a
substantial
governmental
interest
which
would
be
so
served.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
in
a
village
which
has
a
history
for
more
than
25
years
of
freely
permitted
year
after
year
the
banners
of
the
red
cross,
a
symbol
of
the
red
cross,
the
banners
of
the
american
field
service,
the
signs
of
the
united
fund,
and
when
the
village
itself
displays
christmas
lights
and
ornaments
on
its
own
lampposts,
village
employees
decorate
christmas
trees
in
the
lobby
of
village
hall,
village
employees
ornament
a
living
tree
in
boniface
circle
where
this
creche
sat
for
24
years,
it
seems
difficult
to
me,
though
it
is
certainly
conceivable,
and
one
would
have
to
wait
and
see
what
justification
the
village
advanced,
to
determine
if
it
advanced
a
significant
governmental
interest.
but,
standing
here,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
find
it
difficult
to
perceive
a
substantial
governmental
interest
which
would
be
legitimately
served
by
a
total
ban
of
all
unattended
signs
and
symbols.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
boniface
circle...
i
believe
the
village
probably
could
say
that
there
was
a
substantial
governmental
interest
to
be
served
by
banning
all
unattended
displays,
but
that
isn't
the
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
but,
bear
this
in
mind,
your
honor,
the
village
manager
testified
in
this
case
by
deposition
and
his
testimony
is
that
in
the
24
years
the
creche
was
displayed
at
boniface
circle
there
was
never
a
complaint
that
it
was
aesthetically
displeasing,
there
was
never
a
complaint
that
it
constituted
visual
clutter,
never
a
complaint
that
it
interfered
with
traffic.
the
only
complaint
ever
made
was
that
it
was
sectarian,
divisive,
offensive,
and
unneighborly.
it
is
difficult
for
me
standing
here
to
evaluate
whatever
reason
the
village
might
advance
when
this
court
affirms
for
a
new
regulation.
all
i
say
is
it
must
be
reasonable
in
time,
place
and
manner.
it
must
not
be
content
based
or
if
it
is
content
based,
then
there
must
be
a
compelling
governmental
interest
to
support
it
and
i
can't
conceive
of
any.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
that
may
well
be
permissible
but
it
doesn't
solve
the
issue
in
this
case.
that
doesn't
solve
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
don't
think
the
district
court
would
enter
such
an
order,
justice
white.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
order
would
simply
state
that
the
village
may
not
rely
upon
the
establishment
clause
or
in
its
argument
of
divisiveness
or
offensiveness.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
it
has
not
passed
upon
regulations
which
were
not
before
it
nor
could
it.
the
only
reasons
offered,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
were
the
establishment
clause
and
offensiveness.
the
court
rejected
those.
now,
if
next
year
the
village
postulates
a
regulation,
someone
will
have
to
decide
if
it
is
a
reasonable
regulation
designed
narrowly
to
support
a
substantial
governmental
interest.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
don't
think
the
constitution
would
permit
it,
sir.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
yes,
sir.
and,
almost
every
first
amendment
case--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--i
think
that
is
impermissible,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons
among
others.
first,
the
first
amendment
as
this
court
has
construed
it
means
anything,
is
that
inhibitions
of
expression
may
not
be
content
based
absent
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
so
compelling
that
only
a
clear
and
present
danger
test,
for
example.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
not
necessarily.
i
can
conceive
of
a
content
neutral,
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
regulation
which
would
leave
the
village
latitude
to
ban
a
swastika.
the
question
would
be
does
it
pose
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
peace
and
order?
the
scarsdale
police
force--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--religion
is
the
opiate
of
the
people.
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
put
that
up,
may
it
please
the
court,
so
long
as
the
red
cross
can
put
up
its
banners.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
don't
think
the
constitution
can
admit
such
a
distinction,
justice
stevens.
let
me
give
you
a
more
difficult
case.
let
us
assume
that
the
planned
parenthood
organization
is
unpopular
in
scarsdale
for
the
views
it
maintains
about
a
woman's
right
to
abortion.
can
scarsdale
permit
the
united
fund
to
put
its
banner
up,
the
red
cross
to
post
its
symbol
and
its
banners
and
the
community
chest...
excuse
me,
the
cancer
crusade
to
put
up
a
sword?
can
it
do
that
and
yet
deny
access
to
planned
parenthood?
i
think
not
unless
the
first
amendment
has
to
be
rewritten.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
would
assume,
your
honor,
no
matter
what
this
court
decides
in
this
case,
no
municipality
may
inhibit
speech
on
the
basis
of
content
unless
it
presents
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
disorder,
unless
it
interferes
with
other
uses
or
unless,
in
the
case
of
the
explicit
sexual
statuary
which
my
friend
envisions,
it
is
unsuitable
for
viewing
by
children.
but,
even
if
this
court
reverses
here,
the
difficulties
of
line
drawing
will
not
be
obviated.
if
the
village
of
scarsdale
or
any
village
anywhere
in
the
land
can
ban
this
display
because
its
content,
its
message
is
unpopular
or
offensive,
or
unwantable,
where
will
it
go
next?
the
liberal
party
and
the
conservative
party
are
on
the
ballot
in
my
state
of
new
york.
relatively
speaking
they
are
minority
parties.
can
their
fund
raising
banners
be
banned
because
the
majority
of
scarsdale
in
its
wisdom
thinks
the
views
of
those
two
groups
are
extreme?
can
they
ban
banners
of
an
anti-nuclear
group
because
the
majority
believes
that
their
views
are
inconsistent
with--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--if
you
are
going
to
permit
the
red
cross,
if
you
are
going
to
permit
the
united
fund...
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
the
banner--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--unless
that
presented
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
breach
of
the
peace
which
the
scarsdale
police
were
unable
to
deal
with,
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
put
it
up
so
long
as
other
banners
are
there.
and,
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
a
sign
which
simply
says
the
red
cross
or
the
red
cross
symbol
is
unintended
to
give
a
message.
when
those
banners
are
put
up
in
march
and
when
the
symbol
is
put
up
in
a
railroad
station
in
scarsdale
every
march,
the
message
which
is
intended
to
convey
is
please
give
money
to
the
red
cross.
that
is
a
message,
that
is
an
entreaty,
it
is
a
prayer,
it
is
expression.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
think
that
is
an
unconstitutional
distinction.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
don't
think...
let
me
put
it
another
way,
in
an
affirmative
way.
when
the
state
opens
a
place
for
the
expression
of
views,
it
may
not
select
those
who
may
express
those
views.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
that,
to
me,
is
an
expression
of
a
view
and
i
think
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
to
say
that
i
may
ask
for
funds
for
the
red
cross,
i
may
ask
for
funds
for
the
pta,
but
i
may
not
express
my
views
about
a
non-fund
raising
function.
i
don't
think
that
is
the
kind
of
distinction.
after
all,
it
is
content
based
and
this
court
has
held
time
and
time
again
that
only
a
compelling,
a
compelling
government
interest
can
justify
a
content-based
exclusion
from
a
public
forum.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
agree
with
that,
chief
justice.
now,
let
me
spend
just
a
moment,
if
i
may,
on
the
perry
case.
that
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
before
the
court
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
court
explicitly
noted
that
the
mailboxes
in
the
public
school
were
not
a
public
forum.
denial
of
access,
the
court
said,
was
not
because
of
the
viewpoint
of
the
non-certified
union,
it
was
based
upon
status.
the
most
important
thing,
i
think,
for
me
to
note
about
the
perry
case
is
the
court
statement
that
a
state
may
use
property
for
its
intended
purpose
or
restrict
its
use
so
long
as
the
regulation
is
reasonable
and
not
an
effort
to
suppress
expression
merely
because
public
officials
oppose
the
speaker's
view.
that,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
this
case.
what
we
have
here
is
expression
for
which
access
is
denied
and
for
no
other
reason
that
some
functionaries
in
the
village
of
scarsdale
find
that
the
view
sought
to
be
expressed
is
controversial,
unpopular,
divisive
and
offensive.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
constitution
does
not
permit.
on
the
establishment
clause,
if
i
may--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--there
is
a
difference--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--i
think
the
total
effect
of
reading
the
appendix
is
that
it
was
rejected
because
some
were
offended
by
its
display,
that
it
was
not
considered
neighborly
to
manifest
a
point
of
view
which
others
did
not
share
or
which
made
them
uncomfortable,
and
that
it
was
thought
to
breach
a
wall
which
was
thought
erroneously
we
now
know
to
exist
between
church
and
state.
i
don't
find
that
very
much
different
than
saying
since
i
don't
like
what
you
propose
to
say
i
won't
let
you
say
it.
there
is
a
slight
difference
but
i
don't
think
it
amounts
to
a
constitutional
difference.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
can
conceive
of
a
priest
saying
that
i
am
so
firmly
devoted
to
the
principle
of
non-intermingling
of
church
and
state
that
i
don't
believe
religious
symbols
should
be
displayed
on
public
property.
i
can
understand
that
position.
he
might
very
well
entreat
the
village
trustees
not
to
permit
it.
but,
the
constitution
here
is
the
problem.
so
long
as
the
district
court
found
this
village
freely
granted
access
to
its
parks
for
the
display
of
unattended
symbols,
with
that
finding
of
the
district
court
which
was
explicitly
sustained
by
the
second
circuit
and
is
not
challenged
here,
it
was
not
challenged
in
the
second
circuit,
i
don't
think
you
can
say,
yes,
to
one
symbol
and
no
to--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--yes,
sir,
unless
there
is
a
compelling
governmental--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--yes,
sir,
no
matter
how
hateful,
no
matter
how
hateful.
on
the
establishment
clause,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
seems
to
me,
if
i
may
be
trite,
clearly
and
without
doubt
that
it
is
disposed
of
by
lynch.
if
a
city
may
itself
erect
and
display
a
creche
in
the
context
of
a
christmas
celebration,
then
how,
may
i
ask,
how
in
the
world
is
the
establishment
clause
offended
by
permitting
a
private
group
to
erect
a
creche
in
the
context
of
a
christmas
observance
which
was
not
unlike
that
of
pawtucket,
not
unlike
that
at
all?
how
can
that
be
said
to
convey
a
message
from
the
state
to
its
citizens
that
the
state
was
endorsing
the
christian
religion?
i
don't
think
the
argument
can
survive
a
reading
of
lynch.
let
me
close
by
alluding
very
briefly
to
the
christmas
celebration
in
scarsdale,
which
my
friend
said
not
a
word
about.
boniface
circle
was
selected
in
1957
or
1956
as
the
site
for
the
creche
display
by
the
scarsdale
creche
committee
because
that
was
the
traditional
site
of
scarsdale's
christmas
observance.
at
that
place
a
local
organization
sang
christmas
carols
each
year,
much
of
the
time
on
platforms
provided
by
the
city,
and
their
voices
were
amplified
over
a
sound
system
provided
by
the
village.
throughout
the
christmas
season,
25
years
at
least,
the
two
lamp
posts
in
boniface
circle
have
been
festooned
with
lights
and
christmas
ornaments.
the
little
park
is
in
the
center
of
the
business
district
and
every
lamp
post
in
the
business
district,
village
property,
is
likewise
decorated
with
lights
and
ornaments.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
think
there
is
a
difference,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
a
constitutional
dimension.
if
i
am
right
that
symbols
may
not
be
differentiated
because
of
content,
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
a
christmas
light
is
three
inches
long
and
the
creche
nine
feet
wide
should
make
any
difference.
i
think
the
basic
question
is
under
what
circumstances
may
the
state
restrict
the--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--the
infant
jesus.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
and
mary
and
joseph
and
the
sheep
and
the--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--pardon
me?
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
have
never
seen
one,
your
honor,
but
conceivably
they
could
be--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--i
would
have
to
concede,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
message
of
the
creche
is
far
more
religious
than
a
string
of
christmas
lights
or
a
wreath.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
it
is
more
specific,
but
the
significant
thing
to
me
is
that
it
is
in
the
context
of
observance
of
a
national
holiday;
that
the
holiday
is
celebrated
by
people
of
all
religious
persuasions.
it
is
not
only
religious
christians
who
buy
gifts
and
exchange
them
and
who
exchange
greetings
of
peace
and
goodwill,
it
is
our
society
as
a
whole.
so,
whether
we
like
it
or
not,
christmas
has
come
to
be
a
holiday
with
a
wide-spread
secular
acceptance.
i
think
it
is
in
that
context
that
the
creche
is
part
of
the
symbol
of
christmas
even
though
it
emphasizes
the
religious
aspect
more
than
other
decorations
do.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
think
it
is
important.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
if
a
village
had
never
allowed
an
unattended
symbol
because
no
one
had
ever
requested
permission
to
display
it,
then
the
question
would
be,
when
permission
was
denied,
was
this
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restriction
which
supported
a
significant
governmental
interest?
would
it
interfere
with
traffic,
would
it
be
aesthetically
displeasing?
there
are
all
sorts
of
grounds
which
a
municipality
might
advance
for
saying
no
symbols
of
any
kind.
but,
of
course,
that
isn't
the
case
here.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
think
that
history,
your
honor,
is
important
principally
to
show
that
this
could
not
really
be
offensive,
this
really
could
not
be
a
fighting
symbol.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
well,
we
have
a
lawsuit,
your
honor,
because
beginning
in
1976
a
lawyer
who
was
associated
with
the
new
york
civil
liberties
union
moved
into
scarsdale
and
he
brought
a
lawsuit
and
the
matter
has
been
in
turmoil
ever
since
that
time
regrettably
so.
i
think
controversies
of
this
kind
should
be
settle
locally
with
good
will
on
both
sides.
and,
much
as
it
is
a
honor
and
pleasure
for
me
to
be
here,
i
regret
that
i
am
here.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
not
so,
your
honor,
not
so.
my
clients,
the
scarsdale
creche
committee,
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
it
would
be
willing
to
display
its
creche
on
any
suitable
public
park
land
in
scarsdale
and,
indeed,
in
1981,
when
access
to
public
parks
were
denied,
they
displayed
this
creche
on
a
sidewalk
across
the
street
from
the
park
where
it
was
vandalized.
it
seems
in
no
circumstances
a
group
which
has
displayed
a
creche
the
same
place
for
24
years,
with
exceptions
being
generated
only
in
1976,
not
on
the
ground
of
aesthetics
or
traffic
or
what-have-you,
has
a
right
to
maintain
to
let's
get
settled--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--my
clients
had
no
option,
your
honor.
my
clients
had
no
option.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
don't
think
that
is
the
answer,
justice
marshall.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
oh,
they
could
have,
but
that
isn't
the
answer.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
no,
it
would
not,
sir.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
i
don't
believe
the
record
would
support
that
conclusion.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
no,
sir.
the
reason
the
creche
was
put
in
boniface
circle
in
the
first
place
was
because
that
was
the
site
of
the
village's
traditional
christmas
observance
where
the
lamp
posts
were
strung
with
lights
and
where
the
carols
were
sung.
now,
once
a
tradition
begins
inertia
continues.
it
wasn't
until
1976
a
fuss
started.
when
permission
was
denied
in
1981,
my
clients
did
move
their
creche
across
the
street.
but,
what
they
seek
is
a
level
space
in
the
center
of
town
which
is
accessible
to
pedestrians.
it
makes
no
point
to
put
a
creche
in
a
church
back
yard
where
its
view
is
obstructed
by
trees
and
shrubs.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
the
record
here
shows
that
only
one
church
was
centrally
located
and
met
that
minimal
requirement.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
it
shows
that
five--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--i
assume
so.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
nobody
lives,
justice
marshall,
in
boniface
circle
or
in
a
centrally
located
place
where
shoppers
and
pedestrians
would
see
the
creche
throughout
the
season.
mr.
marvin
schwartz
five
of
the
seven
do,
but
all
of
the
seven
have
scarsdale
post
offices
and
all
seven
of
the
churches
are
either
in
scarsdale
or
in
the
immediate
surrounding
area
with
scarsdale
post
office
addresses.
no
point
was
made
of
that,
your
honor,
in
any
of
the
courts
below.
with
all
respect--
mr.
marvin
schwartz
--i
meant
within
the
forum
of
the
board
of
trustees.
that
is
what
i
meant.
these
people
have
been
before
the
board
of
trustees
on
this
subject
year
in
and
year
out
and
it
is
regrettable
it
could
not
be
resolved
there.
ultimately
it
will
have
to
be.
thank
you.
