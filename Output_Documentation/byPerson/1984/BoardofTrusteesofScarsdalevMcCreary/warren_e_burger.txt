i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
frankel.
chief
justice
burger
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
frankel,
i
am
not
sure
i
track
your
emphasis
on
unattended.
suppose
they
had
two
persons,
one
on
each
side
of
the
creche,
ringing
a
bell
or
doing
something,
would
that
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
burger
then
you
think
it
would
be
all
right?
chief
justice
burger
is
that
critical
to
your
position?
chief
justice
burger
who
the
sponsors
are?
chief
justice
burger
or
the
residence
of
the
sponsors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
schwartz?
chief
justice
burger
wouldn't
there
be
something
like
a
governmental
interest
if
the
recital...
the
preamble
said
that
in
order
to
minimize
vandalism
with
respect
to
unattended
symbols
that
no
unattended
symbols
would
be
allowed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
from
what
you
have
said
that
if
only
the
creche
as
a
symbol
were
allowed,
but
all
other
faiths
and
religious
symbols
were
prohibited
that
that
would
not
stand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--i
suppose
those
symbols
are
intended
to
convey
the
same
general
message,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
is
it
just
more
specific?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
frankel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
