justice
rehnquist
may
i
ask,
mr.
frankel...
i
think
you
perhaps
read
the
judge...
judge
pierce's
opinion
somewhat
more
broadly
than
i
do.
i
was
just
looking
at
what
seems
to
me
the
operative
sentence
on
page
25a
of
the
petition,
the
second
sentence
in
the
conclusion.
he
says,
"we
remand
for
the
entry
of
an
injunction
prohibiting
the
village
from
relying
on
the
establishment
clause
as
a
reason
for
prohibiting
the
erection
of
a
creche
at
boniface
circle,
a
traditional
public
forum,
for
a
period
of
approximately
two
weeks.
"
now,
if
that
was
the
reason
the
village
gave,
surely
it
could
come
back
and
give
any
number
of
other
reasons
other
than
that
that
the
second
circuit
would
probably
sustain.
justice
rehnquist
but,
might
not
that
depend
on
the
reason
you
give
for
turning
down
the
request
for
an
unattended
symbol?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
defend
the
right
of
the
village
to
refuse
to
place
the
creche
for
two
weeks
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
violate
the
establishment
clause?
justice
rehnquist
but
what
if
the
village
in
the
past
has
allowed
other
uses
of
the
park?
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
can't
the...
supposing
it
had
pursued
the
kind
of
policy
you
say
for
the
last
25
years
and
it
has
resulted
in
having
the
creche
up.
now,
the
majority
of
the
people
in
scarsdale,
let's
say,
are
jews
rather
than
christians
and
they
would
rather
just
not
have
the
parks
used
for
any
sort
of
symbols
like
that
if
they
have
to
put
up
a
creche.
i
don't
see
why
they
couldn't
have
a
neutral
policy
that
says
at
least
in
boniface
circle
which
is
right
in
front
of
everybody,
we
are
not
going
to
have
anything.
justice
rehnquist
i
realize
that
isn't.
i
don't
think
that
is
what
the
village
said.
justice
rehnquist
why
can't
it
say
we
just
don't
want
any
content
oriented
messages
in
boniface
park,
it
just
causes
too
much
hassle,
one
side
is
yelling,
the
other
side
is
yelling?
we
want
to
cut
it
out.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
scarsdale
said
in
boniface
circle
or
the
railroad
station
or
wherever
they
now
have
red
cross
banners
in
support
of
fund
raising,
we
will
let
any
fund
raising
group
that
is
active
for
scarsdale
put
up
a
banner
but
we
are
not
going
to
have
anything
else?
justice
rehnquist
why?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
city's
response
here
would
be
we
haven't
opened
a
place
for
expression
of
all
views,
all
we
have
opened
is
a
place
for
signs
supporting
fund
raising
drives.
justice
rehnquist
all
i
was
suggesting
is
that
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
isn't
ordinarily
thought
of
as
settling
something
locally.
