justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
schwartz,
your
view?
if
the
village
in
response
to
the
request
had
then
adopted
a
regulation
saying
no
more
unattended
symbols
in
the
park
and
for
that
reason
you
may
not
show
the
creche,
would
that
have
been
permissible
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
well,
that
is
my
restriction.
i
have
given
you
a
specific
example.
justice
stevens
it
is.
justice
stevens
well,
does
it.
you
are
just
rephrasing
the
question.
i
am
really
interested
in
your
answer.
justice
stevens
no.
i
am
just
asking
you
under
your
view
of
the
law
before
we
decide.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
the
statement
that
is
quoted
at
the
end
of
your
opponent's
reply
brief
says
that
the
reason
was
it
is
inappropriate
to
use
public
property
for
religious
expression
which
is
not
necessarily
saying
it
would
violate
the
establishment
clause.
they
just
think
as
a
matter
of
community
policy
it
is
inappropriate.
supposing
they
relied
on
that
reason
and
no
other,
what
happens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
not
be
a
sufficient
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
change
the
question
a
little
bit.
supposing
they
said...
they
made
the
controversial
argument,
we
don't
want
things
like
burning
crosses,
swastikas
and
the
like,
so
we
will
not
permit
any
symbol
that
might
be
considered
inappropriate
to
a
large
segment
of
our
community?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
response
to
your
opponent
is
his
horrible
examples
about
the
swastikas
and
all
that,
those
parade
of
horrors,
yes,
that
is
exactly
what
might
be
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
he
doesn't
go
that
far,
it
just
upsets
a
lot
of
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
see
a
distinction
between
the
red
cross
and
symbols
of
that
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
your
view
is
that
this
decision
means
that
planned
parenthood
has
a
right
to
put
up
the
kind
of
sign
you
describe
in
this
park?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
before
you
go
on
to
the
establishment
clause
that
there
is
at
least
theoretically
a
basis
for
distinction
between
saying
everything
offensive
shall
be
banned
and
saying
i
will
ban
it
because
i
disagree
with
what
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
read
the
reason
here,
it
wasn't
necessarily
that
they
disagreed
with
the
message
of
the
creche,
they
just
thought
this
was
an
inappropriate
use
of
the
religious
symbol.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think,
for
example,
a
catholic
priest
who
would
be
clearly
sympathetic
with
the
message
could
ever
oppose
having
the
creche
in
the
village
square?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
the
constitution
requires
that
all
unattended
symbols
be
treated
as
fungible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
allow
solicitation
for
the
red
cross,
you
must
allow
solicitation
for
legal
advocacy
groups
and
others
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
take
you
back
to
your
argument
about
the
history
in
scarsdale
which
i
think
you
rely
on
rather
heavily
that
there
has
been
a
history
of
symbols
in
the
park.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
can't
deviate
from
that.
supposing
you
had
a
community
which
had
no
comparable
history,
had
never
allowed
symbols.
i
would
assume
you
would
not
contend
that
they
couldn't
continue
that
policy
and
refuse
a
creche?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
i
was
wondering
if
you
were
willing
to
concede,
and
i
guess
you
are
really
not
quite
willing
to,
that
if
there
had
been
a
total
absence
of
symbols
in
the
past,
then
they
could
continue
that
policy.
i
was
wondering
what
you
would
do
in
a
community
which
had
scarsdale's
history,
but
then
for
a
period
of
five
or
ten
years
they
had
no
creches
and
nothing
else,
and
then
the
controversy
arose.
justice
stevens
which
history
would
you
look
to?
justice
stevens
you
have
a
lawsuit
here.
justice
stevens
your
clients
didn't
want
it
to
be
settled
locally.
