justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
frankel,
i
am
concerned
about
your
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
it
seemed
to
me
at
least
in
looking
at
it
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
city
could
adopt
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
of
restriction.
presumably
those
restrictions
might
incorporate
a
provision
that
unattended
displays
will
not
be
permitted
in
the
park.
do
you
think
that
such
a
restriction
would
be
one
that
the
city
could
properly
adopt
under
that
opinion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
that
opinion
would
permit
the
city
to
adopt
the
regulation
that
i
suggest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
isn't
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
required
the
city
to
permit
unattended
displays
such
as
a
creche.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
display
of
a
creche
or
a
cross
or
something
symbolic
of
that
kind
is
symbolic
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
if
it
is
speech,
we
don't
normally
suppress
it
on
the
grounds
that
some
people
find
it
offensive,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
the
city
park
a
public
forum?
could
anybody
go
out
there
and
speak
in
favor
of
nazism
or
some
other
offensive
topic?
justice
o'connor
why
doesn't
the
city
just
say
that
and
say
we
have
a
rule
against
unattended
symbols?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
city
rules,
as
you
described
it,
one
that
says
we
will
not
allow
unattended
displays
if
they
are
controversial
or
if
the
engender
confronters.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
a
sign,
is
there
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--there
is
a
sign
presumably
with
the
display
that
says
that
it
is
sponsored
by
the
committee.
justice
o'connor
so,
it
is
a
little
hard
if
you
look
at
the
sign
to
attribute
the
sponsorship
to
the
city,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
if
the
city
allowed
a
speaker
on
the
subject
of
christianity
to
speak
at
the
park
that
the
people
would
attribute
that
sponsorship
to
the
city?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
do
object
to
that
characterization
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
again
appeared
at
least
to
say
the
city
could
have
a
neutral
restriction,
for
example,
banning
all
unattended
displays.
so,
it
is
hard
to
turn
that
order
of
the
court
into
what
you
say
is
an
affirmative
order
to
display
it.
