mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1981
in
widmar
against
vincent,
this
court
held
that
a
public
university,
the
university
of
missouri,
where
it
had
opened
its
meeting
rooms
to
over
100
various
groups
of
students
for
various
kinds
of
speech
and
discussion
was
forbidden
by
the
free
speech
clause
to
deny
such
a
meeting
room
to
a
group
of
students,
a
cornerstone
group,
wishing
to
hold
prayer
and
religious
discussion
meetings.
in
this
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit,
that
court
has
held
that
the
village
of
scarsdale
in
westchester,
under
the
rule
of
widmar
and
vincent,
is
compelled
or
required
to
allow
a
group
of
christian
churches
and
their
christian
adherence
to
place
and
leave
a
creche
or
nativity
scene
in
a
small
public
park
in
the
center
of
the
village
for
a
period
of
two
weeks
or
so
around
the
christmas
season.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
various
ways
the
municipality
could
approach
this
problem.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
very
possibly,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
it
is
as
true
that
there
is
such
a
requirement
here
as
it
was
in
widmar
against
vincent
which
has
been
applied
by
the
circuit
to
this
case.
when
the
case
went
back
to
the
university
of
missouri,
presumably
they
could
adopt
time,
place
and
manner
regulations.
for
example,
they
could
have
abolished
their
meeting
rooms.
what
we
say
is
in
this
case
that
what
scarsdale
has
done
without
time,
place
and
manner
regulations
so-called
is
constitutional;
that
there
is
no
such
thing
required
under
the
first
amendment
as
an
open
public
forum
for
unattended
statues,
symbols,
structures,
and
signs,
and
that
therefore
widmar
and
vincent
does
not
apply
to
this
case;
that
the
circuit
should
be
reversed
as
things
stand
under
the
way
that
scarsdale
has
run
its
parks
up
until
now.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
never
denied
that.
my
friend
says
we
dispute
it.
we
not
only
agree
to
it,
your
honor,
but
we
embrace
it
as
i
hope
to
show
in
the
argument
as
i
might
mention
right
now.
this
is
a
free
speech
case.
it
goes
off
on
the
free
speech
clause.
at
some
earlier
point,
there
was
a
free
exercise
claim
which
was
rejected
properly
and
properly
abandoned.
under
this
conception
of
the
free
speech
clause,
if
scarsdale
in
its
existing
situation
with
such
regulations
as
it
has
and
doesn't
have
must
allow
a
creche,
then
it
must
allow
a
sign
saying
vote
republican,
it
must
allow
a
swastika,
it
must
allow
a
sign
saying
support
planned
parenthood.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
don't
normally,
your
honor,
provided
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
public
forum
where
people
are
allowed
to
express
themselves
in
the
manner
in
question.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
public
forum
under
hague
and
the
cio
and
all
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
up
to
now,
but
not
for
unattended
symbols
that--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--your
honor,
the
city
has
said
it
in
the
first
case
that
raised
the
problem
in
a
controversial
fashion.
if
the
first
case
had
been
an
effort
to
place
a
hammer
and
sickle
in
boniface
circle
and
the
village
had
denied
the
request,
it
would
have
behaved
properly
provided
it
stated
a
principle
that
was
decent
and
neutral.
as
the
solicitor
general
of
that
city
says,
the
village,
which
is
not
a
legal
institution,
not
less
than
the
courts
certainly,
may
proceed
case
by
case
to
the
problems
as
they
come
before
it.
this,
in
the
whole
history
of
scarsdale,
appears
to
be
the
only
object
offered
for
placement
on
a
park
that
has
been
controversial.
in
the
prior
history
of
scarsdale
there
have
been
about
six
kinds
of
things
in
the
park
and
i
might
say,
i
hope
without
arrogating,
that
i
think
the
scarsdale
park
in
this
sense
are
like
the
parks
of
america
generally
that
all
of
us
know.
what
you
have
had
is
friendly,
communal
and
in
some
sense
innocuous
symbols
like
the
red
cross,
the
united
fund,
community
fund,
american
field
service,
and
that
is
about
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
as
of
today
i
think
the
fair
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
yes
as
the
rule
is
evidence
by
practice.
that
is
to
say
it
has
had
one
controversial
symbol
presented
to
it.
i
might
say
that
in
the
non-controversial
symbols,
even
the
red
cross,
the
united
fund
and
so
on
as
this
record
shows,
each
one
has
been
presented
by
the
village
manager
to
the
board
of
trustees
and
they
have
considered
each
one
for
its
aesthetic
suitability
which
cities
and
municipalities
can
do
in
the
use
of
their
property,
and,
indeed,
in
the
use
of
private
property.
it
is
considered
then
in
terms
of
their
impact,
as
the
record
shows,
on
the
sensibilities
of
the
residents
of
the
village
and
it
has
made
it
determinations
accordingly,
sometimes
saying
you
may
put
the
red
cross
on
this
piece
of
land,
not
boniface
circle,
which
is
the
place
that
has
always
been
demanded,
but
on
some
other
park.
our
record
shows
that
nobody
thus
far
has
ever
tried
to
compel
the
village
to
emplace
a
symbol
that
it
believes
in
its
local
judgment
is
offensive
to
a
large
proportion
of
the
village
residents
for
whom
those
parks
are
held
in
trust
for
all
of
them,
who
all
support
it
and
who
all
pay
the
expense
of
maintaining
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
i
want
to
say
two
or
three
things
in
response
to
that
question.
first,
judge
pierce
goes
on
and
says
"it
is
remanded
for
action
regarding
a
disclaimer
sign
or
signs
and
for
other
such
action
as
is
consistent
with
our
determination
herein.
"
now,
the
locution
the
court
used
in
widmar
could
have
been
exactly
the
same
one.
missouri
university
had
relied
on
the
establishment
clause
as
its
defense
against
allowing
cornerstone
to
use
those
rooms.
but,
let
me
go
further.
we
argue
that
on
our
first
and
basic
proposition
that
widmar
does
not
apply
here.
reversal
is
required
without
ever
reaching
the
establishment
clause
because
we
say
that
the
notion
of
an
open,
public
forum
in
this
case,
which
is
a
novel
case
after
all,
has
never
been
applied
to
require
municipalities
to
allow
in
their
parks
unattended
symbols
that
are
offensive
to
a
great
many
of
the
people
for
whom
those
parks
are
held
in
trust.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
we
have
given
the
reason
first,
of
course,
in
our
brief,
but
if
you
look
through
the
record
of
this
case
you
will
find
the
reasons
and
they
are
not
stated
in
the
form
of
legal
brief.
the
village
trustees,
including
one
rather
eloquent
and
articulate
lawyer
named
oman
summarized
their
views
under
a
number
of
headings
and
the
main
was
that
to
place
this
christian
symbol
in
the
shared
park
was
unneighborly
and
was
offensive
to
a
great
many
of
the
people
who
share
those
parks.
another
reason
given
was,
according
to
one
or
more
of
the
trustees,
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
do,
your
honor,
but
we
say
that
without
that
defense
we
win
any
way
because
just
as
we
argue
that
the
village
does
not
have
to
allow
a
display
like
the
one
that
was
held
"protective"
in
brannenberg
and
ohio.
a
village
in
mississippi
does
not
have
to
allow
a
display
showing
some
hooded
klan
figures
and
a
sign
saying
send
the
blacks
back
to
africa
and
the
jews
back
to
israel.
we
say
and
i
assert
that
no
village
in
america
has
ever
allowed
such
things
and
none
is
required
to
under
the
free
speech
clause.
we
say
by
the
same
token
though...
i
take
the
example
of
offensive
symbols
that
are
more
widely
offensive.
we
say
by
the
same
token
this
is
true
of
the
creche.
the
creche
may
well
be
and
is
to
a
majority
not
a
hateful,
but
a
cherished
symbol.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
we
have
to
look
at
those
and
i
might
say
if
i
had
to
take
one
case
of
this
court's
precedence
to
rely
on
i
think
i
would
take
perry
education
association,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent,
and
i
think
we
would
win
on
either
one.
there
you
will
recall
it
was
held
that
the
mail
boxes
were
not
a
public
forum
for
communication
of
the
kind
attempted
although
the
incumbent
union
could
communicate
through
them,
the
out
union,
the
minority
union,
could
not.
now,
that
was
sustained
and
the
court
analyzed
the
kinds
of
public
property...
and
that
is
what
i
use
the
case
for...
that
we
classify
for
this
kind
of
purpose.
there
is
the
open,
public
forum,
there
is
a
limited
public
forum,
and
there
is
the
government
property
that
is
not
a
public
forum
at
all.
now,
i
say
that
the
park
in
this
case,
for
purposes
of
unattended
structures
and
symbols,
is
not
an
open,
public
forum;
that
the
uninhibited,
robust,
and
wide-open
debate
that
the
first
amendment
assures
for
speakers
and
speech
does
not
extent
to
cluttering
the
parks
with
controversial
symbols
to
stand
there
and
beguile
or
benumb
the
residents
as
they
walk
in
those
places.
therefore,
i
say
that
the
doctrine
of
perry
applies
here
and
perry
said
it
didn't
matter
that
the
alleged
forum,
the
communication
device
given
by
the
government
could
be
used
by
the
ymca
and
some
other
civic
kinds
of
associations.
it
still
did
not
become
an
open,
public
forum.
at
most
the
court
said
if
you
restrict
the
use
of
this
governmental
communicative
device
to
certain
kinds
of
communications
you
may
be
required
to
allow
similar
kinds
of
communications.
here
we
deal
with
a
situation
in
that
respect,
in
that
doctrinal
respect
very
like
perry.
the
village
is
allowed
a
few
charitable,
educational,
civic
organizations
to
put
up
their
signs
and
nobody
disputes
that.
if
somebody
with
a
similar
sign
wanted
to
put
his
up
or
hers,
i
suppose
the
village
would
have
to
be
consistent.
but,
within
the
terms
of
perry,
it
is
not
required
that
the
village
allow
a
klan
symbol,
a
hammer
and
sickle,
a
sign
that
says
god
doesn't
hear
the
prayers
of
jews,
or
any
other
of
the
kinds
of
expression
that
people
are
free
to
make
orally
in
public
parks,
but
that
we
say
has
never
been
compelled
under
the
free
speech
clause
of
the
first
amendment,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
never
squarely
reached
this
somewhat
interesting
question
and
we
say
never
should
be.
and,
we
say
that
the
circuit
must
be
reversed
without
ever
reaching
its
establishment
clause
argument
though
we
reach
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
do
take
that
position
and
let
me
say
that
i
will
try
to
reach
it
and
i
will
reach
it
in
a
few
minutes.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
is,
your
honor,
but
the
second
circuit,
with
all
deference--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--well,
it
skipped
point
one.
it
skipped
point
one
and
that
is
why
i
make
it
point
one.
you
don't
find
a
word
in
the
circuit's
opinion
whether
there
is--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--your
honor,
the
other
ground
that
i
am
giving--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--well,
they
might,
but
the
argument
was
made
to
them,
your
honor,
and
they
skipped
it.
what
is
a
litigant
to
do
when
he
says
point
one,
second
circuit,
widmar
doesn't
apply?
if
you
would
allow
speech
of
this
kind,
which
the
village
agrees
with
absolutely
and
allows,
it
doesn't
follow
that
you
must
permit
an
unattended
structure
or
symbol.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
they
did.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
will
come
to
that--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--i
will
come
directly
to
that,
but
i
want
to
preserve
the
important
argument
that
you
won't
find
a
word
in
the
circuit's
opinion
about
a
subject
in
our
view,
rather
eloquently
treated
by
judge
stewart
in
the
district
court,
about
the
difference
between
an
unattended
symbol
setting
on
the
land
giving
its
message
when
its
owners
aren't
there,
called
the
scarsdale
creche
committee,
though
the
majority
of
its
proponents
don't
even
live
in
scarsdale.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that
is
the
way--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
let
me...
we
say
widmar
doesn't
cover
and
logically
because
it
doesn't
cover
the
circuit
must
be
reversed
without
reaching
the
establishment
clause,
but
let
me
reach
it.
that,
of
course,
brings
us
to
last
year's
decision
in
lynch
against
donnelly
and
i
want
to
state
quickly
what
we
think
are
the
salient
distinctions
between
that
case
and
this
one.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
we
think
as
an
exercise
of
the
right
of
a
live
speaker
to
speak
the
speaker
may
probably
bring
with
him
or
her
a
symbol,
a
sign.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
it
would
be
all
right,
because
then
it
becomes
clear
that
it
is
that
speaker's
message
that
is
being
delivered.
here--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--he
takes
the
symbol
with
him,
exactly,
and
that
has
been
touched
upon
in
more
than
one
of
this
court's
cases,
most
recently
taxpayers
against
vincent.
let
me
illustrate
a
little
further,
your
honor.
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
mr.
charles
butler,
was
asked
and
said
he
never
goes
down
to
boniface
circle
even
to
look
at
the
creche.
he
feels
strongly
and
deeply
that
the
creche
must
be
there
but
he
is
not
there.
who
is
there?
nobody
is
there.
whose
speech
is
this,
your
honor?
this
is
called
the
scarsdale
creche
and
i
repeat
half
or
more
of
the
people
who
put
it
there
don't
even
live
in
scarsdale.
judge
stewart
said--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--it
is
quite
important.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor.
it
is
illustrative,
it
is
illustrative
in
an
interesting
way
and
we
look
at
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
of
the
point
that
this
is
the
speech
of
the
creche
and
the
land.
this
is
scarsdale's
creche.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
pardon?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
says
it
is
placed
there
by
the
scarsdale
creche
committee,
the
scarsdale
creche
committee,
a
private
organization.
just
as
the--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--no,
it
is
not
hard
at
all,
your
honor.
and,
many
of
the
people,
as
is
stipulated
in
this
record,
find
that
it
is
a
mingling
of
the
public
property
with
this
private
message
that
gives
a
kind
of
sense
of
sponsorship
and
identification.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor,
they
would
attribute
it
to
that
speaker,
but,
you
know,
in
this
case
again
we
have
to
use
the
facts
of
the
case.
this
creche
committee
was
offered
by
a
group
of
christian
clergymen
the
use
of
church
properties
to
rotate
the
creche
upon
and
they
said,
no,
putting
it
at
a
church
property
would
defeat
the
ecumenical
aspect
of
their
creche.
well,
they
were
asked,
couldn't
you
put
a
sign
there
and
say
this
isn't
this
church's
creche,
this
is
the
creche
of
the
scarsdale
creche
committee.
no,
that
was
not
an
acceptable
solution
and
they
are
right,
your
honor,
because
people
walking
by
seeing
the
object
there...
children
don't
read
the
sign.
others
say,
well,
if
it
is
the
scarsdale
creche
committee's
creche,
what
is
it
doing
here?
the
village
must
at
least
view
it
with
benign
approval
or
acquiescence
or
something.
the
mingling
is
there
undoubtedly
and
it
is
perceived
as
such
by
some
of
the
people
who
share
the
ownership
of
this
municipal
property.
and
it
was
held
to
offend
on
that
ground
by
a
majority
of
those
people's
elected
representatives.
now,
i
want
to
answer
mr.
justice
white
and
i
want
to
do
it
by
coming
directly
to
lynch
against
donnelly
which
upheld
by
a
close
margin
the
right
of
pawtucket's
city
officials
to
have
a
creche
on
private
property
which
the
city
owned,
had
spent
$200
for,
and
sponsored.
are
there
any
distinctions?
we
say
there
are
critical
distinctions
if
the
court
please.
first,
it
is
important
that
there
the
city
wanted
to
put
up
the
creche
and
had
decided
that
it
had
a
secular
purpose
for
doing
that.
this
court
sustained
that
judgment
of
the
local
officials
about
the
purpose
and
propriety
of
that
creche.
here,
the
local
officials
have
concluded
they
don't
want
a
creche
in
the
park.
they
don't
see
a
valid
secular
purpose
for
it.
and,
you
have
a
court
ordering
them
to
place
it
there.
we
say
that
is
a
significant
distinction.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
until
the
solicitor
general
made
that
suggestion...
and
this
doesn't
bind
the
court...
let
me
say
none
of
the
parties
have
felt
that
this
could
go
back
and
the
second
circuit
could
look
at
it
again
and
the
scarsdale
board
could
debate
it
some
more.
we
have
all
construed
the
opinion
as
saying
scarsdale
must
allow
the
creche.
now,
we
could
be
wrong.
let
me
assure
the
court
as
a
realistic
matter
that
if
this
case
goes
back
and
it
is
affirmed
it
will
be
deemed
an
order
to
allow
the
creche.
and,
i
am
assuring
the
court
as
a
legal
matter--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--oh,
i
guess
so,
your
honor,
i
think
so.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
am
referring
to
just
the
way
the
circuit
wrote
it.
we
are
affirmed
on
that--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--i
feel
i
have
accomplished
something,
your
honor.
let
me
pursue
the
distinctions
of
lynch
briefly.
here
you
have
a
creche
on
the
public
land
with
all
the
problems
of
aura
and
identification
to
which
i
have
spoken.
here
you
have
a
creche
that
in
this
circle
stands
quite
alone
as
the
pictures
show
dearly
in
the
record,
is
not
surrounded
by
all
the
things
in
the
display
involved
in
pawtucket.
our
friends,
with
all
the
rollicking
humor
that
we
lawyers
enjoy,
talk
about
count
of
reindeer
and
teddy
bears
and
so
on.
we
don't
ask
the
court
to
count
them,
but
we
say
and
the
court
wrote
is
that
the
constant
emphasis
on
that
display
it
must
be
deemed
in
our
view
to
be
meaningful
if
not
decisive
in
itself.
finally,
i
want
to
say
that
in
scarsdale,
in
this
record,
you
have
a
history
of
long,
bitter
divisiveness.
you
have
divisions
in
the
board
of
trustees,
you
have
voters,
including
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
saying
our
vote
is
affected
by
the
way
the
trustees
do
with
the
creche,
you
have
candidates
for
office
telling
their
position
on
the
creche,
and
we
say
you
don't
have
the
prediction
that
the
chief
justice
made
in
lemon
and
kurtzman
but
the
fact
of
divisiveness
of
the
kind
that
is
a
factor
in
our
view
in
establishment
clause
questions.
before
i
try
to
save
two
minutes,
if
the
court
please,
i
want
to
say
that
i
repeat
what
i
started
with.
if
we
are
wrong
in
our
establishment
clause
position,
if
the
village
may
allow
the
creche,
it
does
not
follow
that
it
must
and
we
think
the
circuit
has
held
that
it
must
and
that
it
is
wrong
in
that.
thank
you.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
i
have
about
a
minute
and
a
half,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
it
is
clear
that
mr.
schwartz's
clients
and
another
group
brought
this
lawsuit
after
the
village
board
had
settled
locally
its
view
on
this
subject.
i
think
the
court
should
know
that
the
turmoil
in
scarsdale
which
has
grown
begins
in
1960,
as
the
record
shows,
and
continues
and
accelerates
and
does
not
begin
with
the
lawsuit,
the
abortive
lawsuit
by
the
civil
liberties
union
person.
i
think
in
answer
to
a
question
put
by
justice
stevens,
it
should
be
said
that
this
is
not
a
case
by
any
means
of
viewpoint
discrimination.
you
just
have
to
read
the
somewhat
anguished
expressions
of
then
mayor
stone
who
had
once
voted
to
allow
the
creche
and
came
to
realize
its
significance
standing
there
speaking
for
scarsdale
and
changed
her
vote,
who
is
a
christian,
who
has
a
creche
of
her
own,
to
realize
that
this
is
not
an
anti-christian
expression.
you
just
have
to
read
the
statement
of
ten
christian
clergymen
quoted
at
the
end
of
our
reply
brief
against
offending
their
non-christian
neighbors,
against
appropriating
the
public
property
for
the
practice
of
religion,
against
mingling
religion
with
the
state,
even
our
own
religion,
to
realize
this
is
an
effort
to
keep
the
village
free
of
the
kind
of
division
that
has
erupted
and
is
not
in
any
sense
a
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
viewpoint.
i
think
with
all
the
back
and
forth,
the
line
is
clearly
drawn
and
the
potential
significance
for
the
parks
in
the
cities
and
villages
of
america
ought
to
be
clean.
the
first
question
is
must
they
open
those
parks
to
unattended
structures,
to
swastikas,
to
creches,
to
abortion
controversies,
or
may
they
limit
the
parks
as
almost
all
american
parks
have
been
limited
to
community
symbols
that
the
people
care
about,
restricting
them
in
this
fashion.
thank
you.
