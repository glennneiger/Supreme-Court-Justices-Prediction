justice
white
but,
you
do
insist
that
leaving
these
unattended
symbols
in
the
park
would
be
an
establishment
of
religion,
is
that
your
position?
justice
white
because
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
heart
of
the
second
circuit's
decision
which
was
that
the
city
shouldn't
be
able
to
rely
on
the
establishment
clause
to
keep--
justice
white
--i
understand
your
other
argument,
but--
justice
white
--i
am
not
sure
what
the...
if
the
city
isn't
relying
on...
is
forbidden
to
rely
on
the
establishment
clause,
i
just
don't
know
what
the
second
circuit
would
do
about
refusals
to
allow
this
creche
on
other
grounds.
justice
white
they
might
agree
with
you
completely.
justice
white
they
certainly
disagreed
with
your
argument
that
this
unattended
creche
is
an
establishment.
justice
white
they
certainly
disagreed
with
your
position
on
that.
justice
white
what
else
did
they
disagree
with
you
on?
justice
white
that
is
the
way
you
avoid
widmar.
justice
white
at
least
you
say
widmar
doesn't
cover
a
situation
like
that.
justice
white
that
would
depend
a
good
deal
on
what
the
opinion
of
this
court
would
say.
justice
white
i
think
it
would.
justice
white
well,
we
probably
won't
use
just
a
one-word
affirmance.
[laughter]
justice
white
would
you
figure
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
second
circuit's
opinion
and
judgment
if
there
was
an
injunction
entered
on
remand
ordering
the
city
to
allow
this
creche?
justice
white
not
under
this?
justice
white
the
second
circuit
has
not
mandated
that
the
creche
be
in
the
park?
justice
white
widmar
would
read
on
that,
wouldn't
it?
