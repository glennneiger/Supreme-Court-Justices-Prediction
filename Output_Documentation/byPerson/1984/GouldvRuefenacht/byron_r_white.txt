justice
white
well,
this
argument
would
lead
to
just
saying
that
there
isn't
any
private
sale
of
stock
that
was
reached
by
the
securities
law.
justice
white
well,
it
sounds
like
it
so
far.
justice
white
a
purely
private
transaction?
justice
white
well,
so
are
thousands
of
others
that
are
covered,
i
suppose.
justice
white
well,
if
i
just
buy
some
shares
of
general
motors
from
some
other
person
and
he
misrepresents,
is
that
exempt
from
the
securities
laws?
justice
white
i
can't
imagine
anything
more
private.
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
stock
isn't
registered?
it
is
just
a
small
corporation.
i
just
buy
some
shares
of
a
private
company
from
another
person,
no
public...
is
that
a
public
matter?
justice
white
would
that
be
covered
by
the
securities
laws
under
your
view?
justice
white
you
may.

[generallaughter.]
justice
white
i
would
have
to
report
it
at
a
certain
way.
justice
white
i
just
bought
the
stock
for
investment,
and
that
is
all
i
wanted
to
do.
justice
white
no,
it
was
just...
the
stock
has
been
in
these
same
hands
for
a
long
time.
the
fellow
was
just
tired
of
owning
it,
so
he
sold
it
to
me.
justice
white
not
covered.
justice
white
is
that
the
established
rule
or--
justice
white
--what
is
your...
i
know
you
say
we
ought
to
look
at
the
economic
realities
and
all
that.
i
am
not
sure
i
know
even
what
you
mean.
is
it
your
view
that
you
should
look
to
see
if
the
purchase
is
for
investment
or
for
management
or
for
what?
justice
white
well,
which
is
it?
which
is
covered
and
which
isn't?
justice
white
well,
if
you
can't,
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
bright
line
you
are
drawing.
justice
white
that
is
fine.
now
tell
me
what
it
is.
justice
white
in
general
you
are
talking
about
whether
he
is
making
an
investment
or
whether
he
is
buying
it
to
make
money
by
himself.
justice
white
well,
refine
it
if
that
is
too
general.
justice
white
but
it
is
also
a
good
way
to
protect
his
investment,
isn't
it?
justice
white
yes,
but
a
veto
power
doesn't
always
have
the
characteristics
of
control.
it
has
just
got...
it
is
a
limited
partner.
you
may
not
want
to
control
the
business
at
all
except
to
protect
your
investment.
justice
white
but
i
suppose
you
must
hope
that
we
decide
the
immediate
preceding
case
in
a
particular
way.
justice
white
either
way.
no.
0
[generallaughter.]
you
don't
mean
either
way.
justice
white
very
well.
mr.
pearlman.
justice
white
what
did
we
use
in
the
notes
case?
justice
white
on
notes?
justice
white
on
that?
justice
white
maybe
you
will
be
here
on
that.
justice
white
well,
you
say
that
any
sale
of
any
kind
of
stock
that
any
fool
would
recognize
as
stock
is
reached
by
the
securities
laws?
justice
white
well,
a
fortiori
if
a
fool
would
even
recognize
it.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
white
anyway,
you
think
that
stock
is
stock,
any
sales
stock
is
covered.
justice
white
none,
apparently.
