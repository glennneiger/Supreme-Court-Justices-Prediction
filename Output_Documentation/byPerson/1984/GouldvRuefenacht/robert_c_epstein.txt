mr.
robert
c.
epstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
our
contention
that
mr.
ruefenacht's
right
to
veto
every
major
company
decision
is
joint
management
of
the
continental
business
in
which
he
repeatedly
referred
to
himself
as
a
partner
and
the
fact
that
this
was
an
entirely
private
transaction
unique
between
two
individuals
which
in
no
sense
involved
a
public
capital
market,
that
these
collective
factors
require
the
conclusion
that
in
substance
this
was
the
purchase
of
a
one-half
interest
in
a
business,
and
that
the
transfer
of
stock
was
merely
incidental
to
the
transaction.
we
submit
that
the
federal
securities
laws
were
never
meant
to
cover
this
kind
of
a
transaction,
and
that
mr.
ruefenacht's
claims
of
fraud
belong
in
state
court.
as
authority
for
our
position,
your
honors,
we
rely
fundamentally
upon
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
now,
it
is
true,
as
was
pointed
out
this
morning,
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
specifically
address
the
sale
of
business
situation,
and
indeed
both
factions
in
the
current
judicial
debate
acknowledge
that
congress
never
specifically
considered
the
sale
of
business
question.
however,
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
an
unmistakeable
congressional
emphasis
upon
the
goals
that
the
securities
laws
do
seek
to
achieve.
those
goals,
reaffirmed
in
the
legislative
history
as
recently
as
1982,
and
as
expressed
by
this
court
in
forman
fundamentally
were
to
protect
the
integrity
of
public
capital
markets
and
to
protect
investors
dealing
in
those
markets.
now,
the
legislative
history
also
indicates
that
these
goals
emerged
from
a
congressional
recognition
that
the
dispersion
of
corporate
ownership
had
led
to
abuses
in
the
capital
markets
where
people
who
ran
corporations
were
taking
advantage
of
people
who
owned
corporations.
most
importantly,
your
honors,
it
was
recognized
by
congress
that
the
effects
of
such
abuses
transcend
the
individual's
loss,
but
rather
chill
investment
and
capital
formation
generally.
it
was
also
recognized
by
congress
that
such
abuses
could
be
perpetrated
because
the
owners
of
corporations
did
not
have
managerial
control
over
the
operations
of
those
corporations.
the
owners
held
the
symbols
of
ownership
but
had
no
ability
effectively
to
influence
the
destiny
of
their
investment
or
to
influence
the
operations
or
the
profitability
of
the
corporation.
there
is
nothing,
not
one
word
in
the
legislative
history
about
protecting
someone
like
mr.
max
ruefenacht,
who
engaged
in
a
purely
private
transaction,
unique,
as
i
said,
between
two
individuals
which
indeed
involved
stock
which
could
not
have
been
publicly
traded
because
it
did
not
have
a
common
or
equivalent
value
to
most
people.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
well,
it
is
not
our
position--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--we
are
a
purely
private
transaction.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
well,
that
may
be
so,
your
honor.
may
i
point
out
that
where
the
context
is
a
public
context
involving
either
an
organized
exchange
or
a
public
solicitation,
such
as
was
involved
in
howey
and
other
cases,
in
our
view,
that
goes
so
much
to
the
heart
of
what
congress
was
talking
about
when
it
passed
the
securities
laws
that
there
ought
to
be
coverage.
where
you
are
dealing,
however,
in
an
entirely
private
context,
the
inquiry
has
to
be
a
little
deeper.
that
is
not
to
say
that
private
transactions
will
necessarily
not
be
covered,
but
the
inquiry
is
into
the
economic
realities
of
those
transactions.
and
if
i
may
at
this
point,
in
further
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--well,
except
for
the
fact,
your
honor,
that
there
is
an
important
public
element
there,
and
that
public
element
is--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--no,
your
honor.
the
way
you
have
framed
that
hypothetical,
no,
that
seems
to
be
an
entirely
private
and
unique
transaction.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
under
my
view,
your
honor,
an
entirely
private
transaction
like
the
one
you
just...
i
would
have
to
ask
your
honor
some
more
questions
about
the
facts.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
the
first
question
i
would
ask
would
be
whether
your
honor
as
the
purchaser
of
that
stock
in
a
privately
held
corporation--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--i
understand
that,
justice.
whether
your
honor
participated
in
some
fundamental
sense
in
the
activities
of
that
corporation.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
assuming
that
to
be
true,
your
honor,
i
would
also
ask
whether
this
stock
that
your
honor
bought
was
a
smaller
unit
of
a
larger
offering
or
whether
it
was--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--not
covered,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
not
covered.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
well,
your
honor,
there
is
no
established
rule.
that
is,
i
believe,
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
are
here
today,
because
there
is
confusion,
but
on
this
point
of
public
versus
private,
i
would
like
to
raise
and
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
superintendent
of
insurance
case,
which
has
been
cited
by
my
opponents
all
throughout
this
litigation
as
standing
for
the
proposition
that
private
transactions
are
covered
by
the
securities
laws.
it
is
true,
as
justice
douglas
pointed
out
there,
that
that
was
a
private
transaction.
however,
there
was
an
important
public
element
to
that
transaction,
which
was
that
the
securities
that
were
sold
in
that
case
were
treasury
bonds.
these
were
securities
that
were,
if
not
being
publicly
traded
at
that
time,
were
certainly
of
a
common
or
equivalent
value
to
most
people,
and
therefore
could
have
been
publicly
traded,
and
therein,
i
submit
to
the
court,
lies
an
important
public
interest
in
that
private
transaction.
now,
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
a
desire
to
protect
someone
like
mr.
ruefenacht,
who,
as
i
said,
engaged
in
a
purely
private
transaction,
idiosyncratic,
as
between
two
individuals,
which
involves
no
public
capital
market.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
a
desire
to
protect
mr.
ruefenacht,
who
jointly
managed
this
company,
and
who
was
no
more
dependent
upon
others
in
this
business
than
one
partner
is
dependent
upon
another
partner
to
use
his
or
her
best
efforts
and
inimitable
talents
to
make
a
business
a
success.
indeed,
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
one
in
this
business
who
had
more
control
over
profitability
than
mr.
ruefenacht,
and
i
specifically
point
to
magistrate
peretti's
findings
on
the
fact
that
mr.
ruefenacht's
veto
powers
extended
not
just
to
questions
of
capital
structure
of
this
company,
such
as
the
issuance
or
transfer
of
shares,
but
also
to
operational
decisions
going
right
to
the
heart
of
what
this
company's
business
was,
namely,
questions
of
borrowing
money
and
of
the
taking
on
of
new
product
lines.
we
submit
that
this
court
in
evaluating
this
transaction
under
the
securities
laws
cannot
ignore
congress's
goals
simply
because
there
was
stock
involved
in
the
transaction,
but
in
effect
that
is
just
what
the
third
circuit
did
by
looking
only
to
the
characteristics
of
the
stock
and
ignoring
all
of
the
findings
found
by
the
magistrate.
we
don't
believe
that
the
literal
or
mechanical
approach
taken
by
the
third
circuit
was
ever
intended
by
congress
in
the
application
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
the
legislative
history
urges
flexibility
in
application
of
the
securities
laws,
but
does
not
say
that
the
court
shall
be
flexible
only
where
the
result
will
be
to
extend
coverage.
also,
the
context
clauses,
whether
they
be
viewed
as
relating
to
the
economic
context
of
the
transaction,
as
we
believe
this
court
clearly
held
in
the
weaver
case,
or
as
relating
to
the
linguistic
context
of
the
statute,
as
the
third
circuit
said,
in
either
of
them,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
context
clauses
amount
to
congressional
caveats
against
literalism
and
amount
to
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
district
court
looking
into
the
economic
realities
of
this
transaction.
finally,
as
we
read
this
court's
decisions
from
joiner
through
weaver,
the
court
has
never
taken
a
literal
or
mechanical
approach
to
the
securities
laws,
but
rather
has
repeatedly
cautioned
against
just
such
an
approach.
now,
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
the
flaws
in
the
third
circuit's
approach
to
the
securities
laws
are
perhaps
put
best
in
focus
when
one
considers
application
of
the
securities
laws
to
transactions
in
notes.
under
a
literal
approach,
all
note
transactions
would
be
covered
including
mortgage
notes
executed
in
connection
with
the
purchase
of
a
single
family
residence,
and
also
including
notes
executed
in
connection
with
consumer
financing
transactions.
but
both
sides
of
the
current
judicial
debate,
including
such
eloquent
proponents
of
the
literal
approach
as
judge
friendly
and
judge
gibbons
below,
both
sides
acknowledge
that
congress
just
could
not
have
meant
to
cover
those
kinds
of
transactions,
and
as
a
result
both
sides,
with
some
variations,
employ
a
case
by
case
analysis
in
the
note
context
to
determine
which
note
transactions
implicate
federal
securities
laws
concerns.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
very
same
type
of
case
by
case
analysis
is
just
as
essential
in
the
stock
area
for
the
very
same
reasons,
namely,
to
avoid
sweeping
within
the
coverage
of
the
federal
securities
laws
a
multitude
of
cases
which
involve
no
significant
federal
concern
but
which
happen
to
involve
stock.
one
of
the
concerns
which
led
the
third
circuit
to
rule
as
it
did
was
what
can
be
called
the
line
drawing
concern,
a
concern
by
judge
gibbons
about
distinguishing
covered
transactions
from
non-covered
transactions.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
concern
can
be
greatly
ameliorated
by
the
decision
in
this
case.
a
narrow
holding
here
that
mr.
ruefenacht's
absolute
veto
powers,
joint
management,
and
the
fact
that
this
was
a
unique
transaction,
that
those
factors
require
a
conclusion
that
this
was
not
a
federal
securities
transaction--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--the
objective
of
the
transaction,
your
honor,
is
one
of
the
economic
realities.
that
is
precisely
correct.
and
here
the--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--there
are
gradations
of
cases,
your
honor,
and
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
answer
that
entirely
in
the
abstract.
i
can
say
to
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--your
honor,
the
line
we
are
drawing
is
between
the
kinds
of
transactions
congress
intended
to
cover
and
did
not
intend
to
cover.
let
me
see
if
i
can--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--okay.
when
we
are
dealing
with
"public
transactions",
and
i
put
that
term
in
quotes,
your
honor,
transactions
which
involve
the
public
capital
markets,
whether
organized
or
not,
i
submit
that
we
are
involved
with
a
situation
going
so
fundamentally
to
the
concerns
of
congress
that
the
federal
securities
laws
ought
to
apply
as
a
general
proposition.
where
we
are
dealing
in
private
transactions,
your
honor,
the
inquiry
has
to
be
into
whether
the
purchaser
in
this
case
was
dependent
upon
the
efforts
of
others
or
not
dependent
upon
the
efforts
of
others.
that
inquiry
involves
two
components
as
i
see
it.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
that
is
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
in
a
general
sense,
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
well,
there
are
two
components
to
that
inquiry.
component
number
one,
as
we
see
it,
is
the
control
analysis
that
was
performed
by
the
magistrate
and
by
the
district
court
below,
where
someone
obtains
the
kind
of
control
that
mr.
ruefenacht
obtained
over
a
company.
he
is
not
the
kind
of
investor
that
congress
was
seeking
to
protect.
he
is
not
in
that
peculiarly
vulnerable
position
which
generates
a
need
for
the
special
protections
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
he
could
not
impose
his
will
on
the
corporation,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct,
but
what
he
could
do--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
not
only
that,
through
his
joint
management
of
the
company
as
a
result
of
his
efforts
in
obtaining
sales
and
operations
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
he
had,
as
the
magistrate
found,
a
fundamental
influence
over
whether
this
corporation
did
well
or
did
not
do
well.
so
he
was
anything
but
a
passive
investor
in
that
sense.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
mr.
ruefenacht
could
not
do
anything
without
his
partner
going
along.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
there
was
here
a
deadlock
situation,
but
we
submit
that
mr.
ruefenacht's
veto
powers
amount
to
fundamental
control
going
right
to
the
heart
of--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--in
a
generic
sense
of
the
term
"investment",
your
honor,
that
is
true.
in
a
generic
sense,
your
honor,
almost
anything
that
you
buy
can
be
considered
an
investment
to
the
extent
that
you
expect
to
earn
a
living
perhaps
from
it
or
to
have
that
asset
that
you
purchased--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--that
is
true.
i
suppose
in
the
weaver
case
your
honor,
the
weavers
were
in
a
sense
weaver
case,
seeking
only
to
protect
their
investment,
but
nevertheless
the
court
found
that
their
measure
of
control
simply
over
the
borrowing
of
money
was
uncharacteristic
of
the
security.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
some
of
the
concerns
that--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
no.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
a
private
setting
that
would
be
especially
true.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
again,
if
we
are
talking--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--if
we
are
dealing
in
a
totally
private
setting,
not
a
publicly
traded
security
in
any
sense--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--then
it
would
not
be
covered,
and
the
fact
that
management
was
delegated
to
somebody
else
makes
no
difference.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
no,
your
honor.
i
am
not
making
a
distinction
between
whether
a
security
is
listed
on
an
organized
exchange.
there
may
be
closely,
and
i
am
sure
there
are,
closely
held
corporations
which
go
into
the
"public
capital
markets"
to
obtain
funds
and
as
a
result
of
going
into
those
markets
they
implicate
a
federal
securities
interest,
in
my
view.
if
there
is
some
wide
dispersion
of
ownership,
even
though
the
security
is
not
listed
on
any
exchange,
the
transfer
of
100
percent
of
that
security
may
very
well
still
be
covered
because
you
are
dealing
in
a
marketplace.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
so.
i
can't
see
a
situation
where
it
would
not
be.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
yes,
if...
yes,
if
that
security
was
not
of
a
nature
which
could
be
publicly
marketable.
if
you
are
dealing--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--well,
if
we
are
talking
about
a
security,
your
honor,
which
has
roughly
equivalent
value
to
most
people,
and
i
take
that
language
from
the
weaver
case,
if
we
are
dealing
in
that
kind
of
security,
in
my
view,
you
start
to
implicate
the
kinds
of
congressional
concerns
that
i
have
been
trying
to
address.
so,
i
can't
give
you
a
categorical
answer
on
that
point,
your
honor.
your
honor
is
giving
me
a
quizzical
look,
and
i
am
trying
to
give
you
the
best
answer
that
i
can,
but
i
have
to
qualify
it
because
there
can
be
no
categorical
rule,
i
don't
believe,
in
these
kinds
of
situations.
as
the
weaver
court
stated,
it
is
important
to
look
to
the
entire
factual
matrix.
one
element
of
that
factual
matrix,
i
submit,
is
the
nature
of
the
instrument,
whether
it
was
idiosyncratic
to
that--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--your
honor,
when
i
talk
about
idiosyncratic
instruments,
i
am
talking
about
the
kind
of
stock
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
which
had
value
only
as
between
mr.
ruefenacht
and
mr.
burkle,
and
had
no
widespread
value
to
anyone
else,
had
no
equivalent
value,
as
i
said
before,
to
other
people.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
it
would
have
value
in
that
sense,
but
it
did
not
have
the
kind
of
value
that
existed
between
these
two
people.
for
example,
one
of
the
facts
that
the
magistrate
found
was
that
the
purchase
price
of
the
stock
was
in
part
related
to
mr.
ruefenacht
rendering
his
services
to
the
corporation.
that
is
an
element
of
the
uniqueness
of
this
transaction
between
these
two
individuals
which
is
different
from
a
transaction
we
hypothesize
where
the
stock
would
be
sold
to
somebody
else.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--yes,
your
honor.
frankly,
i
can't
distinguish
that
conceptually
from
a
tender
offer
situation,
because
when
you
are
dealing
in
public
markets,
you
get
so
much
to
the
heart
of
what
congress
was
talking
about
in
the
securities
laws
that
i
think
the
securities
laws
do
apply
in
your
honor's
hypothetical.
now,
to
address
some
of
the
concerns
of
the
court
below,
one
concern
was
that
application
of
the
so-called
sale
of
business
doctrine
would
lead
to
anomalous
results.
but
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
third
circuit
did
not
find
that
it
would
be
anomalous
in
this
case
or
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
goals
in
this
case
to
disqualify
the
transaction
from
coverage.
admittedly,
there
have
been
raised
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
academic
commentary
a
great
number
of
very
perplexing
factual
issues,
and
we
don't
purport
to
address
all
hypothetical
cases
today.
what
we
do
ask
the
court
for
is
a
ruling
on
this
case,
which
we
believe
will
set
forth
clearly
the
applicable
principles,
and
the
so-called
anomalous
cases
we
believe
will
in
large
measure
take
care
of
themselves.
also,
the
court
below
was
concerned
about
devoting
federal
judicial
resources
to
the
economic
substance
inquiry.
now,
it
is
true
that
in
this
case
we
have
a
two-day
non-jury
hearing
before
the
magistrate
devoted
to
the
issue
of
control,
but
the
projected
trial
time
that
was
saved
by
that
inquiry
was
far
greater
than
two
days.
now,
i
cannot
prove
this,
your
honors,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
the
vast
majority
of
questions
of
coverage
under
the
securities
laws
will
be
clear.
securities
involved
in
organized
exchanges,
public
capital
markets,
widespread
solicitations
or
offerings
or
purchases,
those
cases,
in
my
view,
are
clearly
covered.
where
there
is
a
legitimate
issue
concerning
federal
securities
laws
coverage,
which
i
submit
will
occur
most
frequently
in
the
private
sphere,
i
submit
that
the
resources
devoted
to
that
inquiry
are
well
worth
the
savings
in
federal
trial
time
otherwise
devoted
to
questions
or
matters
which
involve
no
significant
federal
concern,
but
which
happen
to
involve
stock.
finally,
as
i
started
to
say
earlier,
the
third
circuit
was
mightily
concerned
about
where
to
draw
the
line.
justice
stevens'
hypotheticals
put
that
concern
greatly
in
issue.
that
is
a
concern
which,
as
i
said,
i
hope
this
case
will
help
to
ameliorate,
but
i
don't
believe
that
simply
by
adopting
a
mechanical
test
which
makes
line
drawing
very
easy
is
the
answer
to
that
problem.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
we
ask
this
court
to
decide
this
case
based
upon
the
facts
of
this
case,
as
the
district
court
did,
and
not
based
upon
hypothesized
concerns
in
other
cases
which
in
a
fundamental
sense
led
the
third
circuit
to
rule
as
it
did.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
is
right.
i
agree
that
the
landreth
case
should
be
decided
in
the
same
way
that
this
case
should
be
decided.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
your
honor
leads
me
to
an
interesting
point,
and
that
is
the
point
of
common
venture
which
was
raised
earlier
in
the
colloquy,
and
i
would
like
to
tackle
that
one
head-on.
it
is
a
difficult
point.
as
we
pointed
out,
the
federal
courts
seem
to
be
very
confused
about
what
is
a
common
venture.
i
submit
to
you
that
there
was
no
common
venture
in
this
case,
and
as
authority
for
that
position
i
rely
upon
howey
and
i
rely
upon
weaver.
i
point
out
to
you
that
in
the
howey
case
where
the
common
venture
requirement
was
framed,
the
matter
involved
42
purchasers
out
of
a
solicitation
of
several
hundred.
i
point
out
to
you
that
in
the
weaver
case,
in
chief
justice
burger's
opinion,
there
was
great
emphasis
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
privately
negotiated,
face-to-face
transaction
unique
as
between
two
individuals.
i
suggest
to
you
that
juxtaposing
those
two
cases
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
where
you
have,
as
in
this
case,
a
completely
unique
transaction
between
two
privately
contracting
parties,
that
that
is
not
the
kind
of
common
venture
that
this
court
has
been
addressing
over
the
last
40
years,
and
we
therefore
ask
the
court
based
upon
the
facts
of
this
case
and
not
upon
hypothesized
concern
or
the
single
fact
relied
upon
by
the
third
circuit,
which
essentially
was
that
there
was
stock
involved
in
this
transaction,
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
court
below.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
yes,
briefly,
your
honor.
my
remaining--
mr.
robert
c.
epstein
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
first
would
like
to
address
justice
o'connor's
question
about
what
will
the
result
in
this
case
do
to
the
workload
of
the
federal
courts.
this
is,
of
course,
theoretical,
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
especially
with
the
increased
awareness
among
practitioners
of
this
issue,
that
if
the
sale
of
business
concept
is
rejected,
that
plaintiff's
lawyers
will
be
constrained
to
bring
all
cases
that
in
any
tangential
way
involve
stock
and
an
allegation
of
fraud
in
federal
court.
plaintiff's
lawyers,
i
submit,
would
be
remiss
if
not
negligent
in
failing
to
bring
those
cases
in
federal
court
so
as
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
easier
burden
of
proof
under
the
federal
securities
laws
and
of
the
broader
privity
requirements.
secondly,
a
great
deal
has
been
made
about
the
so-called
structure
of
the
securities
laws
and
how
that
supposedly
indicates
a
congressional
intent
on
the
sale
of
business
question.
i
submit
that
is
an
incorrect
argument
for
the
simple
reason
that
both
sides
of
the
current
debate
recognize
that
congress
never
considered
this
question,
and
if
congress
never
considered
this
question,
i
think
that
the
better
place
to
look
for
the
congressional
intent
is
not
to
the
structure
of
the
acts
but
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
acts.
finally,
the
point
has
been
made
that
control
or
the
passing
of
control
should
have
no
relevance
because
fraud
very
often
takes
place
before
control
passes.
well,
there
are
several
answers
to
that.
answer
number
one
is
that
as
congress
saw
it,
the
dependance
of
the
investor
defines
whether
he
was
the
kind
of
person
that
should
receive
protection
of
the
securities
laws,
and
the
passage
of
control
defines
whether
the
individual
was
dependent.
secondly,
in
the
investment
contract
context,
in
the
howey
case
context,
i
think
all
sides
recognize
that
the
control
analysis
is
very
important
to
the
third
prong
of
the
howey
test,
and
it
is
important
because
it
gives
courts
a
pathway
to
the
legislative
intent
and
a
means
to
evaluate
whether
the
investor
involved
in
a
particular
case
is
in
that
peculiarly
vulnerable
position
which
congress
sought
to
address.
thank
you,
your
honors.
