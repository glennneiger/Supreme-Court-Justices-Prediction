justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question?
justice
stevens
we
are
all
trying
to
grasp
exactly
where
the
dividing
line
is.
you
don't
take
the
position
then,
i
gather,
that
every
sale
of
control
is
exempt
from
the
securities
act?
justice
stevens
it
is
only
if
there
is
a
sale
of
control
and
the
purchaser
thereafter
relies
on
the
management
efforts
of
other
to
produce--
justice
stevens
--so
every
sale
of
a
business
to,
say,
a
bank
or
a
trustee
which
would
then
be...
you
would
have
to
get
some
outsider
to
manage
for
them,
those
would
all
be
covered,
12
percent
sale
of
the
business
in
the
other
case
or
your
business
here.
justice
stevens
to
a
bank
or
a
university
who
is
going
to
hire
some
management
expert
to
run
the
business
for
them.
covered
or
not
covered?
justice
stevens
not
a
publicly
traded
security.
justice
stevens
so
is
every
sale
of
control
of
an
unlisted
security
exempt
under
your
view?
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
go
back.
every
sale
by
a
100
percent
owner
to
a
100
percent
purchaser
of
an
unlisted
security,
always
exempt?
justice
stevens
all
right,
then
the
next
question
is,
all
sales
of
control
of
an
unlisted
security
by
control
block,
52
percent
30,
or
whatever
it
takes
to
constitute
realistic
control
of
an
unlisted
security,
always
exempt?
justice
stevens
well,
i
mean,
if
it
is
a
big
company,
you
are
always
going
to
be
publicly
marketed.
justice
stevens
i
am
assuming,
you
know,
ordinary
common
stock,
you
know.
i
am
not
talking
about
idiosyncratic
instruments.
we
have
just
ordinary
stock.
that
part
is
easy.
but
i
still...
i
just
really
don't
understand
your
distinction.
justice
stevens
why
didn't
it
have
value
to
somebody
else?
you
say
they
resold
10
percent
to
each
of
ten
people.
why
wouldn't
that
have
value?
justice
stevens
but
you
would
come
out
differently
if
it
were
a
publicly
traded
security?
justice
stevens
you
would
agree,
sale
of
control
of
a
publicly
traded
security
with
management
prerogatives
and
all
this
is
covered
by
the
act?
