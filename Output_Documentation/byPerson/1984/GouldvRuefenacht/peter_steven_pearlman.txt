mr.
peter
steven
pearlman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
behalf
of
max
ruefenacht,
the
purchaser
of
one-half
of
the
shares
of
traditional
common
stock
of
continental
import
and
export,
inc.,
i
submit
that
to
accept
the
sale
of
business
doctrine
will
require
this
court
to
disregard
accepted
principles
of
statutory
construction
by
ignoring
the
specific
and
unambiguous
language
of
the
securities
statutes,
abandon
its
own
prior
precedent
and
policy,
and
to
adopt
a
policy
which
is
ambiguous,
unworkable,
not
readily
definable,
and
which
creates
results
which
are
arbitrary
and
unfair
in
the
extreme.
for
50
years,
and
through
numerous
securities
cases,
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
securities
laws
apply
to
traditional
common
stock
has
not
troubled
this
court,
nor
should
it
now.
nonetheless,
mr.
ruefenacht
has
devoted
the
last
four
years
of
his
life
to
litigating
just
that
issue.
the
legislation
which
is
in
issue
here
is
the
definitional
section
of
both
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
in
both
circumstances,
the
legislation
says
clearly
that
a
security
is
defined
as
a
list
of
items
including
specifically
"stock".
this
court
does
not
sit
as
a
superlegislature.
it
is
not
up
to
this
court
or
any
court
to
determine
whether
congress
was
wise
in
enacting
such
a
definition.
the
term
"stock"
in
the
statute
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
it
is
to
be
given
its
ordinary
clear
meaning.
under
those
prescriptions,
the
shares
which
mr.
ruefenacht
purchased,
albeit
a
private,
non-publicly
traded
corporation,
were
shares
of
stock,
and
he
is
entitled
to
remedies
under
the
federal
securities
laws.
petitioner
submits
that
we
must
depart
from
the
letter
of
the
statute,
that
we
must
ignore
its
plain
meaning,
and
that
we
must
examine
the
legislative
history.
the
perceived
intent
of
congress,
and
when
i
say
perceived,
i
mean
petitioner's
perceived
intent
of
congress,
to
determine
what
they
really
meant
when
they
gave
a
very
clear
and
unambiguous
definition
in
the
statute.
the
simple
introductory
answer
to
that
is
that
it
is
not
up
to
a
court
to
examine
legislative
history
when
the
statute
on
its
face
is
clear,
but
even
an
examination
of
the
legislative
history
does
not
avail
petitioner
in
the
way
in
which
he
wishes.
the
legislative
history
itself
does
not
evince
any
intent
to
exclude
transactions
such
as
that
to
which
mr.
ruefenacht
and
mr.
bunkle
entered.
quite
the
opposite.
this
court
in
its
prior
precedent
has
uniformly
stated
that
instruments
which
answer
to
the
name
of
stock,
which
are
stock,
which
bear
the
traditional
attributes
of
stock,
are
securities.
this
court
has
said
it
in
joiner.
this
court
has
said
it
in
tcherepnin,
in
forman,
and
most
recently
in
weaver,
where
this
court
stated
that
the
statutory
definition
of
a
security
excludes
only
currency
and
notes
with
a
maturity
of
less
than
nine
months.
it
includes
ordinary
stocks
and
bonds.
nothing
could
be
more
ordinary
than
the
stock
and
the
bonds
which
mr.
ruefenacht
acquired.
petitioner
submits
that
the
respondent
is
attempting
to
engraft
into
the
statute
something
which
is
not
there.
just
the
opposite
is
true.
we
are
dealing
here
today
with
a
situation
where
the
statute
says
plainly
any
stock.
mr.
ruefenacht
acquired
stock.
in
fact,
the
attempt
to
toss
out
all
other
portions
of
the
definition
other
than
that
of
investment
contract
not
only
violates
almost
every
relevant
concept
of
legislative
interpretation,
but
makes
no
sense
from
a
general
common
sense
standpoint.
when
this
supreme
court
enunciated
its
opinion
in
howey,
it
specifically
dealt
with
the
case
involving
an
investment
contract,
and
it
said
that
the
definition
of
an
investment
contract
is
investment
of
money
in
a
common
enterprise,
expectation
of
profits
to
come
from
the
efforts
of
others.
since
then,
this
court
has
used
that
definition
on
many
occasions.
and
on
every
single
such
occasion
it
has
been
used
to
define
an
investment
contract,
to
see
whether
a
particular
transaction
qualified
as
an
investment
contract.
this
court
has
never
applied
that
standard
to
determine
whether
traditional
common
stock
was
a
security,
nor
should
it.
mr.
peter
steven
pearlman
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
made
a
determination
on--
mr.
peter
steven
pearlman
--a
specific
notes
case.
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
spoken
on
that,
and
i
recognize
that
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits
on--
mr.
peter
steven
pearlman
--on
that
issue
as
well.
that
is
not
before
the
court
today,
but
perhaps
at
some
future
time
it
will
be.
mr.
peter
steven
pearlman
it
would
be
my
great
pleasure,
justice
white.
it
would
be
my
great
pleasure
and
my
great
honor.
mr.
peter
steven
pearlman
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
make
these
differentiations
with
respect
to
notes.
i
do
not
believe
that
we
should
sit
down
and
try
and
determine
what
"notes"
should
be
included
within
the
statutory
definition.
i
believe
that
the
statutory
definition
specifically
excludes
certain
types
of
notes,
notes
with
a
maturity
of
less
than
nine
months,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
statutory
definition
of
notes
permits
an
examination
into
the
underlying
transaction.
i
would
suggest,
however,
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
some
confusion
with
respect
to
notes,
it
may
be
that
notes
are
a
less
commonly
defined
term
than
stock.
"investment
contract"
is
a
vague
term.
it
is
a
term
to
which
this
court
has
applied
a
certain
definition.
stock
is
something
which
is,
i
think
professor
lewis
has
said,
so
quintessentially
a
security
as
to
foreclose
further
analysis.
it
may
be
that
notes
fall
somewhere
in
between,
and
it
may
be,
although
i
disagree,
and
of
course,
as
i
said,
the
case
is
not
here
today,
but
it
may
be
that
with
respect
to
notes,
it
is
somewhat
less
specific
than
stock.
it
is
perhaps
somewhat
vaguer
and
more
akin
to
an
investment
contract,
although
not
necessarily
with
the
same
standard
to
be
applied,
and
it
may
be
that
some
definition
is
necessary
with
respect
to
note,
just
what
a
note
is,
what
type
of
note
we
are
talking
about.
but
there
is
no
definition
which
is
necessary
with
respect
to
traditional
stock.
stock
has
been
defined.
at
least
what
this
court
means
by
stock
was
defined.
it
was
defined
in
tcherepnin.
it
was
defined
further
in
forman.
so
i
do
not
believe
that
whatever
problems
may
have
arisen
in
the
circuit
with
respect
to
notes
need
cause
a
problem
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
this
court
should
adopt
or
reject
the
sale
of
business
doctrine.
until
i
came
here
or
until
i
read
the
briefs,
i
should
say,
in
connection
with
this
appeal
and
then
was
reinforced
a
little
bit
this
morning
and
then
this
afternoon
by
mr.
epstein,
i
really
thought
i
understood
what
the
sale
of
business
doctrine
was.
i
thought
the
sale
of
business
doctrine
was
that
you
looked
to
the
economic
realities
of
the
transaction
and
apply
the
howey
test
to
see
whether
you
fall
into
that
category.
i
always
felt
it
was
impossible
to
really
come
to
any
sort
of
a
meaningful
conclusion
by
use
of
the
howey
test
because
it
necessarily
excluded
certain
things
which
no
one
had
ever
questioned
were
security,
such
as
williams
act
cases,
such
as
many
publicly
traded
transactions,
because
obviously
frequently
when
a
tender
offer
is
made,
there
is
the
intent
to
control.
that
is
one
of
the
major
purposes
for
the
tender
offer.
i
now
find
out
this
morning
that
the
howey
test
is
not
the
sale
of
business
doctrine,
or
vice
versa,
because
apparently
under
the
version
of
the
sale
of
business
doctrine
which
i
heard
today,
you
applied
the
howey
test
sometimes,
but
sometimes
you
don't
apply
the
howey
test.
certainly
you
don't
apply
it
when
you
are
dealing
with
publicly
traded
corporations,
i
guess.
at
least
in
a
tender
offer
with
publicly
traded
corporations.
i
am
not
sure
where
the
line
is
drawn.
there
you
have
to
look
to
some
other
sort
of
legislative
philosophy.
i
am
not
sure
what
that
philosophy
is
or
is
supposed
to
be.
but
what
you
do
is,
you
sit
down
and
you
look
at
the
congressional
intent,
i
guess,
every
time
a
securities
case
comes
to
court.
and
having
done
that,
you
decide
whether
it
is
publicly
traded
or
privately
traded,
and
then
you
have
to
form
your
own
concept
of
whether
or
not
it
is
a
security.
the
test
is
completely
unworkable.
clearly
the
howey
test
cannot
apply
to
transactions
involving
mergers,
williams
act
cases.
when
the
williams
act
was
passed,
incidentally,
it
was
used...
it
used
exactly
the
same
definitional
section.
if
congress
had
intended
to
make
control
an
issue,
or
if
congress
had
thought
there
was
a
problem
with
control
in
the
current
definition,
they
could
have
modified
that
definition.
they
could
have
given
some
specific
statement
of
intention
with
respect
to
tender
offer
cases,
the
acquisition
of
control.
they
didn't,
because
stock
is
stock.
so
we
are
here
today
being
urged
to
accept
a
doctrine
which
really
has
not
been
defined.
mr.
peter
steven
pearlman
i
don't
know
if
any
stock
that
any
fool
would
recognize
as
stock
is
reached
by
the
securities
laws.
certainly
something
which
your
honors
would
recognize
as
stock
would
be
reached
by
the
securities
laws.
perhaps
something
which
i
would
recognize--
mr.
peter
steven
pearlman
--i
am
sure
that
was
intended
to
reflect
the
recognition.
mr.
peter
steven
pearlman
any
sale
of
what
is
really
stock
is
covered.
i
recognize
the
problem
that
arose
in
forman,
and
without
necessarily
agreeing
or
disagreeing
with
whether
or
not
that
was
traditional
stock
and
whether
it
should
have
been
considered
stock,
i
recognize
that
there
are
circumstances
when
having
called
something
stock
doesn't
mean
that
it
really
is
stock.
you
can
suggest
that
the
world
is
flat.
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
is.
there
are
a
number
of
policy
considerations
which
favor
the
rejection
of
the
so-called
sale
of
business
doctrine.
the
primary,
and
the
one
that
first
comes
to
ind,
is
the
fact
that
the
securities
acts
are
to
be
construed
liberally
to
enhance
their
remedial
intent.
certainly
attempting
to
strike
from
the
definition
something
which
is
clearly
there,
something
which
is
unambiguously
there
does
much
damage
to
and
doesn't
benefit
in
any
way
the
remedial
intent
of
the
securities
laws.
the
problem
with
control
is
something
which
i
have
already
discussed,
and
that
is
not
only
does
any
test
which
is
premised
on
control
exclude
transactions
which
i
don't
think
anyone
would
ever
intend
be
excluded,
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
define
control,
as
to
when
the
control
was
to
be
exercised,
what
is
control
under
any
given
circumstance,
and
the
ruefenacht
case
illustrates
that,
i
think,
rather
well.
there
has
been
some
suggestion
that
when
a
person
acquires
control
they
don't
really
need
the
protection
of
the
federal
securities
laws,
because
they
have
the
ability
to
control
the
destiny
of
the
business.
i
suppose
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
the
federal
securities
laws
apply
to
fraud
which
took
place
before
you
assumed
your
control,
and
about
the
best
you
can
do
once
you
have
assumed
this
control
whatever
it
is,
is
to
be
in
a
good
position
to
grab
the
bucket
and
start
bailing.
it
hardly
is
a
good
justification,
however,
for
adopting
the
control
standard.
i
suggest
therefore
that
this
court
reject
the
sale
of
business
doctrine
as
it
is
carved
out
of
whole
cloth,
having
taken...
having
made
an
attempt
to
add
to
the
statute
something
which
was
never
there
in
the
first
place
by
arguments
which
have
no
basis
in
logic
and
no
basis
in
law,
and
affirm
what
i
think
my
counsel
that
took
the
same
position
as
i
take
today
in
landreth
this
morning
described
as
the
scholarly
opinion
of
judge
gibbons
of
the
third
circuit.
i
consider
it
well
reasoned,
and
i
wholeheartedly
hope
and
expect
that
this
court
will
agree.
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
affirmatively.
i
would
be
honored
to
answer
any
questions
this
court
may
have
of
me.
mr.
peter
steven
pearlman
thank
you.
