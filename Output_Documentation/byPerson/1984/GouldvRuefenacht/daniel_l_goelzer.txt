mr.
daniel
l.
goelzer
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
defining
what
is
a
security,
congress
used
the
plain
term
"stock",
and
the
stock
in
this
case
is
the
garden
variety
of
that
type
of
instrument.
nowhere
in
the
securities
act
or
in
the
securities
exchange
act
did
congress
suggest
that
sales
of
this
sort
of
ordinary
stock
were
ever
to
be
excluded
from
the
securities
laws.
the
petitioners'
case
rests
in
part
on
the
notion
that
only
passive
public
investors
were
intended
to
enjoy
the
protection
of
the
securities
laws,
that
those
who
engaged
in
private
negotiated
transactions
where
they
have
some
ability
presumably
to
extract
information
for
themselves
are
not
within
the
protection
of
the
securities
laws.
but
congress,
i
think,
considered
that
issue
and
reached
a
different
conclusion.
section
4
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
contains
exemptions
from
the
registration
provisions
of
the
act.
almost
30
years
ago,
in
sec
versus
ralston
purina,
this
court
construed
the
private
placement
exemption
as
excluding
from
registration
and
its
disclosure
obligations
transactions
where
the
purchaser
can
fend
for
himself
or
have
obtained
his
own
access
to
the
sort
of
information
that
registration
would
supply.
congress
made
clear
in
the
introductory
phrase
to
section
4
that
transactions
excluded
from
registration
were
included
in
antifraud
protection.
i
think
the
arguments
that
petitioner
makes
here
in
this
regard
were
simply
considered
by
congress,
and
the
place
it
drew
the
line
was
between
registration
and
antifraud
protection,
not
by
excluding
these
private
transactions
from
the
scope
of
the
securities
laws.
petitioner
argues
that
ordinary
common
stock
is
not
stock
at
all
when
it
changes
hands
in
a
transaction
where
the
buyer
acquires
some
measure
of
control
over
the
issuing
company,
but
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
that
theory,
it
would
multiply
the
complexity
and
expense
of
both
sec
and
private
securities
litigation.
i
would
like
to
consider
commission
litigation
first.
under
the
test
the
petitioner
advocates,
commission
enforcement
actions
would
necessarily
become
more
complex
for
reasons
having
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
congress's
objectives
in
enacting
the
laws.
petitioner
argues
in
essence
that
every
time
a
judge
is
confronted
with
a
securities
transaction,
he
needs
to
make
his
or
her
own
decision
concerning
whether
congress
intended
federal
protection
to
apply
to
that
transaction.
thus
even
if
the
commission
were
to
prove
that
a
violation
had
occurred
under
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
laws,
would
still
be
open
to
the
defendant
trying
to
convince
the
court
that
there
was
something
in
congress's
spirit
or
intent
not
manifested
in
the
words
which
provided
a
defense.
mr.
daniel
l.
goelzer
if
my
view
is
adopted,
i
think
it
won't
have
any
effect
on
the
number
of
cases
that
the
commission
deals
with,
since
it
has
always
been
the
commission's
assumption
since
1933
and
1934
that
any
transaction
in
ordinary
stock
is
within
the
scope
of
the
securities
laws.
the
commission
would
not
typically
bring
an
enforcement
action
in
a
case
involving
a
transaction
between
two
private
parties
simply
because
it
wouldn't
be
a
good
use
of
our
resources,
although--
mr.
daniel
l.
goelzer
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
it
certainly
wouldn't
increase
them
beyond
what
they
were
before
1980
or
1981,
since
no
court
had
suggested
that
this
sale
of
business
doctrine
existed
at
all
before
that
time.
i
think
if
the
doctrine
is
adopted,
if
the
petitioner's
position
is
adopted,
we
will
have
at
least
the
same
number
of
cases,
but
they
will
all
include
a
long
threshold
consideration
of
whether
control,
a
very
subjective
and
amorphous
concept,
existed
in
the
case
or
not.
mr.
daniel
l.
goelzer
well,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
this
court,
of
course,
has
not
considered
the
meaning
of
the
term
"note"
in
the--
mr.
daniel
l.
goelzer
--well,
as
i
would
with
stock,
i
would
begin
with
the
literal
term
of
the
statute,
and
start
with
a
presumption
that
any
note
is
included
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
the
lower
courts
have
held,
and
the
commission
doesn't
disagree
with
it,
that
there
are
certain
families,
certain
categories
of
notes
that
were
not
within
congress's
intent
that
would
relate
primarily
to
notes
issued
in
commercial
transactions,
mercantile
transactions
to
finance
inventory,
for
example,
or
for
consumer
purposes.
other
than
those
rather
specialized
exemptions
or
exceptions,
i
would
say
that
a
note
is
within
the
scope
of
the
definition.
i
think
it
is
not...
the
definition
of
security
contains
many
terms.
stock
is
one.
note
is
one.
investment
contract
is
another.
i
think
it
is
not
surprising
that
each
term
has
its
own
specialized
meaning
and
its
own
body
of
case
law
interpreting
it,
but
as
i
said
earlier,
in
this
case
there
is
no
question,
no
one
has
suggested
that
it
is
not
conventional
stock
that
is
involved.
i
think
that
a
second
way
in
which
commission
enforcement
actions
would
be
significantly
burdened
if
the
petitioner's
position
were
adopted
is
that
inherent
in
that
position
is
that
each
security
transaction
must
show
that
it
meets
the
definition
of
investment
contract,
yet
the
commission
often
brings
actions
that
involve
instruments
that
don't
promise
a
share
of
profits.
rather,
they
promise
a
fixed
return
to
the
investor.
the
lower
courts
have
disagreed
concerning
whether
a
fixed
return
meets
the
profit
element
of
the
howey
test,
yet
if
it
doesn't,
such
ordinary
things
as
long-term
corporate
bonds
issued
by
blue
chip
companies
would
be
excluded
along
with
irregular
and
unusual
instruments
issued
by
individual
promoters.
at
best,
the
commission
would
be
forced
to
relitigate
all
of
this
ground,
presumably
already
covered
during
the
past
50
years
under
the
doctrine.
i
think
it
is
also
worth
pointing
out
that
the
position
the
petitioner
urges
would
result
in
arbitrary
and
illogical
distinctions
in
private
litigation.
for
example,
in
this
case,
if
mr.
ruefenacht
had
purchased
his
50
percent
interest
in
continental
in
a
series
of
five
transactions
of
10
percent
each,
presumably
the
first
four
would
form
a
basis
for
federal
litigation,
the
last
would
not,
or
if
in
the
same
transaction
in
which
mr.
ruefenacht
purchased,
his
brother
had
purchased
5
percent
of
the
stock
based
on
the
same
representations
that
were
made
to
mr.
ruefenacht,
the
brother
would
apparently
have
a
cause
of
action,
mr.
ruefenacht
would
not.
and
if
mr.
ruefenacht
had
purchased
his
controlling
interest
from
ten
shareholders,
each
with
5
percent,
apparently
he
would
not
have
a
cause
of
action
against
them.
would
they
have
a
cause
of
action
against
him?
they
would
seem
to
be
the
sort
of
people
that
congress
intended
to
protect,
even
under
the
petitioner's
theory:
passive,
non-controlling
investors.
yet
the
petitioner
says
there
was
no
securities
transaction
involved.
one
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
has
suggested
that
there
is
a
securities
transaction
for
the
sellers
but
not
for
the
buyers.
i
think
that
leads
to
a
good
result,
and
i
would
support
it,
but
i
think
the
logic
of
the
same
transaction
being
or
not
being
a
securities
transaction
depending
upon
whether
you
are
plaintiff
or
defendant,
is
illusive,
and
the
issue
would
undoubtedly
be
litigated
in
the
lower
courts
and
perhaps
ultimately
brought
back
to
this
court.
finally,
i
would
point
out
that
adoption
of
the
sale
of
business
doctrine
will
inject
great
uncertainty
into
business
transactions.
any
time
that
a
significant
amount
of
stock
is
purchased,
the
parties
will
have
no
definite
way
of
knowing
whether
they
have
possible
liabilities
and
possible
rights
under
the
federal
securities
laws.
all
that,
no
matter
how
sophisticated
the
advice
they
might
get
from
counsel,
all
that
will
have
to
await
litigation
in
the
federal
courts
over
this
illusive
and
difficult
issue
of
control.
absent
some
clear
directive
from
congress
that
the
securities
laws
were
intended
to
create
this
sort
of
uncertainty,
or
that
it
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
them,
i
think
this
court
should
be
reluctant
to
create
it.
for
nearly
50
years,
the
business
community,
the
courts,
and
the
commission
have
taken
congress
at
its
word
and
assumed
that
any
purchase
or
sale
of
ordinary
corporate
securities,
whether...
corporate
stock,
whether
between
sophisticated
or
unsophisticated
parties,
was
within
the
antifraud
protections
of
the
securities
laws.
if
petitioners
or
others
believe
now
that
that
determination
should
be
changed,
they
should
address
their
arguments
to
the
congress,
not
the
courts.
thank
you.
