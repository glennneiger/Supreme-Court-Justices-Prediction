mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
might
start
by
supplementing
the
colloquy
about
the
relationship
between
these
two
statutes.
the
new
statute
made
three
changes.
it
said
that
the
practice
of
the
moment
of
silence
is
discretionary
rather
than
mandatory.
the
old
statute
applied
only
to
grades
one
through
six,
so
this
statute
generalized
the
moment
of
silence
to
all
of
the
school
grades.
and
finally,
the
statute
added
the,
what
i
think
is
really
the
purely
informational
addendum,
that
it
is
one
of
the
appropriate
uses
of
the
moment
of
silence
that
so
minded
students
may
use
it
for
silent
prayer.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
statute
doesn't
specify,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
it
simply
remains
in
the
future
to
see
whether
this
teacher
will
make
some
explanation
of
what
it
is
all
about.
i
don't--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--we
don't
believe
that
it
would
matter
constitutionally.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
maybe.
it
seems
to
us
the
central
question
here
whether
the
teacher
in
some
way
respects
the
spirit
of
the
statute,
which
is
to
mandate
and
establish
one
simple
practice,
a
moment
of
absolute
stillness.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
think
the
original
lawsuit
challenged
what
went
on,
what
was
alleged
to
go
on
in
some
alabama
schools,
which
was
vocal
prayer.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
your
honor,
the
lawsuit
was
brought
to
enjoin
the
state
authorities--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
case
or
controversy,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
was
that
the
plaintiff
said
that
it
violates
the
constitution
for
the
state--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--well,
the
suit
was
brought
very
shortly
after
the
new
statute
was
passed
and
the
complaint
was
amended
to
challenge
it.
the
state
of
alabama
is
now
under
an
injunction
preventing
it
from
enforcing
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
violates
the
establishment
clause.
i
mean,
at
that
point
there
must
be
a
case
or
controversy
with
respect
to
whether
that
injunction
may
continue
in
place.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
the
district
court
and
the
eleventh
circuit
concluded
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
and
it
is--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
don't
know,
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
may
be
that
they
were
free
to
do
that,
but
what
this
statute--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--your
honor,
the
statute
institutionalizes
and
puts
the
sanction
of
state
policy
behind
a
practice.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
state
policy
is
that
you
may
start
the
school
day
for
a
moment
of
silence
within
which
so
minded
students
who
are
under
a
claim
of
conscience
have
an
opportunity
to
pray
or
meditate,
all--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
suppose.
i
don't
know
what
the
practice
in
the
alabama
schools
is,
justice
marshall.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
the
case
that
without
this
statute,
long
before
this
statute,
after
this
statute,
children
have
a
right
in
the
alabama
schools
to
pray
silently,
and
of
course,
in
that
sense
it
is
false
to
say
what
is
always
said,
that
it
is
this
statute
that
has
brought
prayer
in
to
the
alabama
schools.
but
what
the
alabama
legislature
has
concluded,
justice
marshall,
and
23
other
states
have,
is
that
the
opportunity
to
pray
is
enhanced,
made
easier,
made
somewhat
more
natural.
a
modern
american
school
is
a
very
busy
and
a
very
noisy
place.
it
is
not
easy
to
find
a
moment
of
respite
and
serenity
within
which
those
students--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--either
one,
either
one.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor.
we
think
that
what
was
in
the
new
statute
was
already
implicit
in
the
other,
that
there
is--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--we
think
it
became
the
public
policy
of
the
state--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--it
simply
reaffirmed
to
the
world
at
large,
to
the
schools--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--your
honor,
we
think
the
message
was
sent
to
everyone
who
looks
at
the
statute
or
was
informed
about
it.
the
statute
simply
makes
explicit
that
one
of
the
uses
to
which
this
moment
of...
this
zone
of
privacy
and
silence
and
serenity--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--we
don't
have
a
record,
your
honor.
i
really,
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
the
point
i
was
addressing
when
i
was
responding
to
justice
marshall
was
that
quite
aside
from
a
formal
moment
of
silence,
students
may
pray
during
snatches
of
inactivity
during
the
day--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--what
the--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--without
the
old
statute,
without
the
new
statute,
without
any
statute.
what
this
statute
does,
what
these
two
statutes
do
is
to
formalize
a
practice.
it
is
a
very
simple,
it
is
really
a
very
inoffensive
practice;
we're
all
used
to
it,
we
have
all
been
asked
occasionally
to
fall
silent
for
a
minute,
to
remember
something,
to
dedicate
ourselves,
and
within
that,
the
with
to
enhance,
to
accommodate
the
opportunity
for
students
who
are
under
a
claim
of
conscience
to
bring
silent
prayer
as
part
of
their
activities
in
school.
i
think
i
want
to
return
to
justice
marshall's
question
because
this
is
absolutely
crucial
to
us.
what
this
statute
does
is
add
an
additional
opportunity.
it
enhances
the
freedom.
it
is
not
that
easy,
it
is
not
that
unembarrassing,
it
is
not
that
natural
for
students
to
find
a
moment
of
serenity.
i
mean,
what
the
moment
of
silence
does
is
to
create
silence.
that
is
what
it
does.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
think
there
is
no
constitutionally
relevant
distinction
between
the
two
statutes.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes.
it
expanded
the
operation
of
the
formal
moment
of
silence
from
grades
one
through
six
to
grades
one
through
twelve.
it
made
a
change
in
the
administrative
structure
because
it
said
the
teacher
has
some
discretion.
then
the
statute
adds
what
was
already
the
case.
how
can
it
be
unconstitutional
for
alabama
simply
to
say
what
was
already
the
fact,
which
is
that
in
this
uncoerced,
neutral
atmosphere,
a
brief
moment
of
stillness,
within
this
small
zone
of
privacy,
it
is
permissible
for
so
minded
students
to
dedicate
their
day
to
god.
what
this
does
is
expand
the
freedom
of
all
the
students
in
a
way
that
is
wholly
inoffensive.
this
is
a
modest
gesture
of
generosity
toward
students
who
are
under
a
claim
of
conscience.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
formal
mechanism
available,
and
maybe
there
might
have
been.
but
in
this
case,
where
the
state
is
now
under
injunction
against
even
putting
the
statute
into
operation,
the
situation
seems
to
us
to
be...
the
confrontation
is
here
before
this
court,
at
least
under
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't,
but
we
don't...
we
don't
think
it
can
be
the
law
that
it
is
all
right
to
knock
down
a
constitutional
statute
because
there
is
another
constitutional
statute
which
to
some
extent
covers
the
same
ground.
