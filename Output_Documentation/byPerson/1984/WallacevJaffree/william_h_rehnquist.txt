justice
rehnquist
well,
were
there
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
the
statute
was
about
to
put
the
statute
into
operation?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
williams,
let
me
ask
you
for
a
moment
about
the
case
in
controversy
problem
which
justice
white
raised
with
your
opponent.
the
district
court's
opinion,
i
see,
says
that
your
clients'
suit
was
initiated
in
order
to
challenge
certain
prayer
activities
initiated
by
his
children's
public
school
teacher.
now,
was
that
the
1982
statute
that
had
actually
been
put
into
effect
at
that
time?
justice
rehnquist
then
it
was
enjoined
before
it
could
actually
be
put
into
effect,
the
'82
statute.
justice
rehnquist
and
what,
people
were
acting
under
it?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
williams,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
one
of
your
responses
to
justice
powell.
i
think,
at
least
i
gathered
from
your
answer
that
you
feel
that
either
the
first
amendment
or
something
else
allows
a
student
to
pray
of
his
own
free
will
without
any
statute.
supposing
the
schools
in
mobile
open
with
math
class,
and
that
the
first
thing
the
teacher
does
when
the
bell
rings
is
say,
john
smith,
what's
eight
times
nine?
well
surely
john
smith
doesn't
have
any
constitutional
right
to
pray
at
that
point.
he's
supposed
to
be
trying
to
answer
the
question.
justice
rehnquist
so
this
kind
of
constitutional
right
to
pray
at
any
moment
is
always
subject
to
the
overriding
concerns
of
the
educational
program
of
the
school,
i
suppose,
unless
there
is
some
sort
of
a
statute
that
says
there
is
a
moment
at
the
beginning
when
you
can
pray
or
do
something
else.
