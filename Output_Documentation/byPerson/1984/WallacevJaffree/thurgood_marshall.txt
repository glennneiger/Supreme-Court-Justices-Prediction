how
about
the
student
that
doesn't
believe
in
prayer
or
meditation?
justice
marshall
but
there
is
no
accommodation
for
him
at
all
except
that
he
can
be
standing
there
as
an
individual?
justice
marshall
mr.
bator,
there
is
no
question
that
the
purpose
of
this,
that
it
was
not
for
silence,
or
am
i
wrong,
does
the
teacher
have
a
right
in
the
public
schools
of
mobile
to
tell
the
children
to
shut
up
for
the
next
five
minutes,
and
i
don't
want
to
hear
a
sound
out
of
you,
without
a
statute?
can't
they
do
that
without
a
statute?
justice
marshall
you
say
maybe?
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
teacher
that
didn't
have
that
authority?

justice
marshall
the
state
policy
is
that
you
can
have
a
moment
of
silence
for
prayer.
justice
marshall
didn't
they
have
that
right
before
the
statute?
justice
marshall
well,
didn't
the
children
in
alabama
have
the
right
to
pray
silently
before
the
statute
was
passed?
