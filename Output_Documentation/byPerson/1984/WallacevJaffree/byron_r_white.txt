mr.
bator,
if
the
teacher
chooses
to
have
a
moment
of
silence,
must
the
teacher
say
what
it
is
for?
justice
white
well,
isn't
it...
wouldn't
the
issue
change
a
little
at
least
if
the
teacher
had
to
announce
what
it
was
for,
or
that
it
is
discretionary?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
i
know
you
believe
that,
but
wouldn't
the
issue
be...
wouldn't
it
have
a
different,
a
little
bit
different
ring
to
it?
justice
white
also,
may
i
ask,
when
this
case
started,
the
attack
was
on
the
teachers'
practices
in
the
school
of
having
a
prayer,
wasn't
it?
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
well,
what
is
the
case
or
controversy
between...
what
was
the
case
or
controversy
with
respect
to
the
moment
of
silence
statute?
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
it
was
never...
that
the
statute
was
never
applied
in
the
school.
justice
white
well,
i
know
you
just
can't
page
through
a
statute
book
and
pick
out
some
statute
you
don't
like
and
sue
to
enjoin
it.
you
have
to
have
a
case
or
controversy.
what
was
the
case
or
controversy
between
this
plaintiff
and
the
state
or
the
school
about
this
statute?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
had
never
been
applied
to
them.
justice
white
well,
it
may
be
that
the
district
court
made
a
mistake
in
saying
there
was
a
case
or
controversy.
justice
white
do
you
think
that
makes
your
case
or
controversy?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
as
justice
stevens
asked
you,
how
does
it
hurt?
how
can
you
show
that
this
statute
hurts
your
client,
unless,
unless
the
children
have
actually
been
in
school
and
in
class
and
the
teacher
has
actually
followed
this
new
statute?
justice
white
nobody
knows
if
it
has
ever
been
applied
yet,
do
you?
justice
white
suppose
under
the
first
statute,
just
the
moment
of
silence
statute,
without
the
word
"prayer"
in
it,
just
meditation--
justice
white
--which
i
think
you
indicated
previously
you
thought
was
facially
valid.
justice
white
suppose
the
teacher
does
say,
we
are
now
going
to
have
a
meditation,
a
minute
of
meditation.
everybody
be
silent
and
meditate
if
you
want
to,
and
a
hand
goes
up,
may
we
pray
during
this
time.
may
the
teacher
say
yes,
you
may
pray
as
well
as
meditate?
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
the
state...
then
isn't
the
state
involving
itself
in
religion
by
saying
yes,
you
may
pray
as
well
as
meditate?
justice
white
and
after
all,
that's
all
the
statute
does
is
say
you
may
pray
as
well
as
meditate.
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't
say
you
are
supposed
to.
it
still...
the
teacher
doesn't
need
to
do
anything.
justice
white
do
you
want
to
indicate
the
paragraph
you
are
talking
about?
