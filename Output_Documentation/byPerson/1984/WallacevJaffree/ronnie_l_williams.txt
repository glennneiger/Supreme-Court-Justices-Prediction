mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
what
has
become
clear
here
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
about
accommodation.
i
think
the
prior
opinions
of
this
court
has
made
clear
that
to
accommodate
the
free
exercise
rights
of
individuals
and
citizens
of
this
nation,
there
must
be
a
burden
placed
upon
those
rights
by
the
government.
here
the
state
has
shown
no
burden
placed
upon
the
rights
of
young
children
in
the
alabama
public
school
system
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
of
their
religious
rights.
i
think
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
earlier
statute,
the
1978
statute
that
provides
for
a
moment
of
silent
meditation,
adequately
provides
time
for
reflection,
introspection,
meditation,
whatever
a
child
feels
a
need
to
engage
in.
there
was
no
need
for
this
new
statute,
the
1981
statute,
but
simply
the
major
part,
the
major
change
simply
added
the
word
"prayer".
i
think
it
is
a
a
clear
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
promote
religion,
to
promote
religious
practice,
and
one
of
the
most
basic
of
religious
practices,
and
that
is
prayer.
the
whole
idea
behind
the
accommodation
doctrine
was
to
assure
that
a
person
fares
no
worse
for
being
religious
than
a
nonreligious
person
subject
to
the
same
governmental
activity.
there
has
been
no
showing
here,
and
i
will
point
out
that
the
record
is
clear,
there
is
no
hindrance
to
any
child
from
praying
during
their
period
of
time
of
meditation
under
the
1978
statute.
senator
holmes,
the
sponsor
of
that
particular
statute,
of
the
new
statute,
the
1981
statute,
testified
in
district
court
that
it
was
his
purpose
to
return
prayer
to
alabama
public
schools,
that
is
constituents
had
advised
him
that
they
felt
a
need
to
have
prayer
in
school.
now,
the
new
statute
was
impermissive,
and
if
there
is
going
to
be
any
type
of
accommodation,
how
do
you
accommodate
when
you
allow
a
teacher
the
discretion
to
make
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
that
statute
will
be
applied
or
not.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
no,
initially,
when
this
case
first
started,
the
activity
being
complained
about
was
teacher-led
group,
vocal
prayer
in
the
public
school
system.
later,
as
the
case
progressed,
this
complaint
was
amended
when
it
became
clear
because
of
other
people
coming
forward,
that
other
religious
activity
was
taking
place
in
the
public
school
system
as
well,
including
silent
prayer,
bible
reading
over
the
public
address
system,
just
a
variety
of
religious
activity.
the
district
court
did
not
allow
plaintiff
to
get
into
the
details
of
all
that...
those
activities,
so
the
main
focus
of
the
case
became
the
teacher-led
prayer,
the
recently
enacted
bob
james
prayer,
and
this
new
silent
meditation
or
prayer
statute.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
no,
the
'82
statute
was
already
in
effect.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
well,
that
was
the
indication
that
we
had
received.
now,
there
was
no
evidence
produced
at
trial
because...
let
me
back
up
one
moment.
this
case
was
amended
once
again
to
allege
class
allegations
because
other
citizens
of
mobile
were
coming
forward
to
complain
about
this
type
of
activity,
silent
prayer,
bible
reading,
just
a
variety
of
activity.
it
was
brought
as
a
class.
the
district
court
would
not
certify
it
as
a
class,
would
not
allow
any
testimony
other
than
on
the
particular
two
statutes,
the
bob
james
statute,
the
new
meditation
statute,
and
the
teacher-led
prayer.
so
there
is...
the
record
is
basically
clean
of
any
actual
testimony
regarding
the
implementation
of
the
silent
meditation
or
prayer
statute.
as
i
was
about
to
say
about
the
accommodation,
you
do
not
accommodate
someone
when
there
is
no
burden.
any
student
had
the
right,
in
fact
still
has
the
right
since
the
1978
statute
has
not
been...
as
a
fact,
has
not
been
repealed.
that
statute
is
still
good
law.
i
disagree
with
counsel
that
appellees
concede
the
constitutionality
of
that
particular
statute.
we
simply
did
not
challenge
it.
the
legislative
history
of
that
particular
statute
was
unclear.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
what
the
purpose
of
that
particular
statute
was,
what
the
effect
of
it
was,
and
whether
or
not
there
was
any
entanglement,
which
is
the
three-part
test
that
has
been
used
by
this
court
repeatedly
in
these
types
of
cases,
establishment
clause
cases.
so
that
particular
statute
was
not
challenged
by
the
appellees.
the
1982
statute...
the
1981
silent
meditation
or
prayer
statute
was
a
different
matter.
the
only
major
change,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
was
the
addition
of
the
word
"prayer",
and
i
think
that
is
very
important
because
it
shows
the
clear
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
bring
prayer
back
to
the
public
schools.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
the
'78
statute?
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
no,
i
do
not
take
that
position.
in
fact,
i
am
not
sure
i
have
a
position
on
that
particular
statute
at
all,
based
on
the
fact
that
there
has
just
been
no
information--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--i
think
i
would
take
the
position
that
it
is
valid
on
its
face,
just
a
simple
moment
of
silence
for
meditation
to
do
whatever
you
will,
which
may
include
prayer
as
well.
i
think
when
the
state
went
further
to
add
or
to
suggest,
and
when
we
talk
about
impressionable
children,
young
children
in
elementary
schools,
some
who
look
up
to
their
teachers,
who
idolize
their
teachers,
i
think
you
are
allowing
the
state
to
promote
religion
as
opposed
to
accommodate
someone's
free
exercise
rights.
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
in
this
situation.
i
think
that
is
why,
as
the
record
would
suggest
in
this
case,
there
was
so
much
turmoil
within
the
mobile
public
school
system.
the
record
of
this
case
i
think
indicates
the
turmoil
that
has
come
about
because
of
this
case.
the
governor
of
the
state
of
alabama
introduced
his
own
statute
suggesting
prayer
in,
i
guess,
a
direct
response
to
the
filing
of
this
complaint
in
district
court.
this
is
no
attempt
to
accommodate
the
rights
of
young
children
in
the
alabama
public
school
system.
this
is
simply
a
blatant
attempt
to
do
i
guess
through
the
back
door
what
cannot
be
done
through
the
front
door.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
a
moment
of
silence
just
to
think
about
why
we
are
here
in
school?
i
see
no
problems
with
that
at
all.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
they
are,
indeed.
i
think
the
difference
here...
well,
in
fact,
they
are
free
to
pray
silently
on
their
own
without
establishing
or
without
the
teacher
saying
anything
at
all.
i
think
the
difference
here
is
by
the
teacher
suggesting
that
in
addition
to
meditating
on
whatever
subject,
that
you
also
may
pray,
imposes--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--well,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that's
the
job
of
the
teacher
or
the
government
explain
each
and
every
law.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
certainly,
i
think
that
would
be
fine
in
a
subject
matter
context,
in
a
curriculum
context,
but
during
a
moment
of
silence,
every
day,
day
in
and
day
out,
when
the
school
bell
rings,
i
think
that
is
more
than
just
teaching
children
about
what
the
first
amendment
stands
for,
what
its
protections
and
prohibitions
are.
i
think
it
goes
much
further.
i
think
it,
as
i
said
earlier,
the
states
stepped
across
that
line
of
neutrality.
it
is
not
longer...
the
state
is
no
longer
being
neutral.
it
is
basically
explaining
one
aspects
of
the
constitution,
and
putting
special
emphasis
on
prayer,
which
offends
the
constitution.
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
if
the
teacher
wanted
to,
say,
monday
discuss
the
first
amendment,
tuesday
the
second
amendment,
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
but--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--no,
i
don't
think
a
teacher...
i
think
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution
as
well,
stepping
across
the
line
of
neutrality
the
other
way,
showing
a
preference
to
the
nonbeliever
or
possibly
some
other
religious
groups
that
do
not
have
prayer
as
part
of
their
religious
tenet.
i
think
as
suggested
by
this
court,
and
held
by
this
court
in
all
of
its
prior
decisions,
that
the
state
must
maintain
total
neutrality
in
the
areas
of
religious
conscience
and
religious
belief,
not--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--discouraging
one.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
certainly.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
i
think
principally
i
would
have
to
say
the
christian
religion
as
to
a
religion
that
is
being
established.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
well--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--i
did
say
christian
religion,
yes.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
i'm
sorry?
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
no,
i
do
not
know
the
total
number.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
certainly.
i
would
think
so.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
i
think
religion
generally
is
being
furthered
by
this
statute.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
i
would
say
yes
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--well,
i
couldn't
identify
them
all,
but
i
was
about
to
say
that
any
religion--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--pardon
me?
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
those
that
deal
with
prayer
or
have
prayer
as
part
of
their
religious
worship
exercises,
i
would--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--no,
i
do
not.
i
believe
that
as
this
court
has
held
in
past
cases
that
it
is
not
the
business
of
the
government,
period,
to
be
involved
in
religious
matters,
even
promoting
a
belief
in
all
religions
or
a
belief
in
no
religion.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
no,
because
i
think--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--well,
if
alabama
simply
had
a
silent
meditation
or
prayer
statute,
no
other
statute,
quite
possibly...
no,
i
don't
think
even...
i
don't
even
think
in
that
situation.
i
do
not
feel
that
this
statute
serves
those
purposes.
i
think
the
moment
of
silence
serves
adequately
any
prayer
needs
of
any
student.
they
are
not
just
that
particular
statute,
but
even
without
that
statute,
a
child
has
the
right
to
silently
pray.
so
i
don't
think
the
government
has
to
take
any
step
at
all
to
encourage
or
influence
a
child
to
pray.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
the
danger
is
that
a
teacher
who,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
may
be
basically
taking
the
role
of
a
parent
in
the
classroom,
someone
that
the
child
looks
up
to,
may
influence
some
children
to
pray,
and
i
think
that
is
the
danger
of
allowing
this
type
of
statute
to
remain
on
the
books.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
well,
a
teacher,
certainly
during
a
period
of
time
in
which
the
student
is
not
actually
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge,
i
would
think
that
he
could
take
time
to
silently
pray,
but
i
don't
think
a
child
has
a
constitutional
right
to,
when
a
teacher
asks
him
what
is
five
plus
four,
to
ask
the
teacher
for
a
brief
moment
to
go
and
pray
and
then
come
back
and
respond
to
the
question.
0
[generallaughter.]
it
may
happen.
i
think
what
is
clear
though
is
that
no
evidence
was
offered
as
to
any
secular
purpose
regarding
the
second
statute,
the
1981
silent
meditation
or
prayer
statute.
the
sole
witness,
senator
holmes,
the
sponsoring
legislator
on
this
particular
bill,
testified
that
it
was
his
main
purpose,
i
mean,
his
only
purpose
was
to
return
prayer
to
the
alabama
public
schools.
there
was
no
secular
purpose,
and
i
think
that
even
under
the--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--i
think
so,
and
not
just
to
the...
mr.
jaffree's
minor
children
in
school.
i
think
all
children
who
are
subjected
day
in
and
day
out
to
the
teacher
suggesting
that
they
can
pray,
not
just--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--no.
the
statute--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--that
is
correct.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
i
think
it
is
public
perception,
and
i
think
with
the
fanfare
of
this
whole
thing,
i
think
with
having
a
statute
that
provides
for
meditation
and
then
turning
right
around
a
few
years
later
and
having
a
very
similar
statute
but
simply
adding
prayer,
i
think
gives
perception
to
those
who
are
interested--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--i
think
what
makes
the
case
or
controversy
is
that
this
is
not
the
business
of
the
state
at
all
to
be
engaged
in
promoting
religion.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
to
my
knowledge--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--well,
it
is
not
on
the
record.
we
do
know
it
has
been
applied.
as
far
as
mr.
jaffree's
children,
no,
we
do
not
have
any
knowledge
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
has
actually
been
applied
in
those
children's
classrooms.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
yes,
i
think
that
the
teacher
may
in
effect
be
telling
a
child
no
more,
or
the
class
no
more
than
what
the
constitution
provides,
but
i
think
by
the
teacher,
a
state
through
the
teacher
engaging
in
that
behavior
suggests
more
to
some
students
than
possibly
to
others,
may
suggest
that
prayer
is
the
preferred
activity
during
this
one
moment
of
meditation.
i
see--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--no,
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that,
but
there
is
no--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--you've
got
it.
and
it
would
not
require
the
state
to
take
a
position
one
way
or
the
other.
also,
in
the
alabama
situation,
i
see--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--that's
correct.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
a
teacher
is
speaking
of
things
that
the
constitution
do...
does
provide,
but
i
think
the
danger,
or
the
difference
is
that
one
statute
prohibits
the
teacher
or
prohibits
the
state
from
engaging
in
that
type
of
activity.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
yes.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
i
would
think
so.
i
would
think
any
time
a
child
inquires
about
even
protected
areas,
the
teacher
has
a
duty
to
respond.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
well,
i
think
as--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--no,
i
think
when
it
becomes
part
of
a
statute,
part
of
a
law,
and
something
that
is
supposed
to
be
done,
that
it
is
impermissible.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
that
is
correct,
but
by
the
statute,
but
having
the
statute
itself
suggests
that
whenever
a
teacher
does
do
it,
that
teacher
will
be
suggesting
or
implying
that
prayer
is
the
preferred
activity.
if
that
was
not
the
case,
that
simply
to
say
you
have
a
moment
to
meditate
for
whatever
purpose
you
wish
to
use
that
time
for,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
no,
i
think
those
statutes
are
perfectly
consistent
with
the
constitutional--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--i
think,
as
this
court
has
held
in
prior
cases,
incidental
benefits
to
religion
does
not
necessarily
constitute--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--well,
if
all
nonprofit--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--yes,
the
district
judge
did
say
that.
i
do
not
agree
with
that
opinion.
i
think--
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
--no,
i
don't.
but
if
i
could
make
one
more
point
about
the
question
that
was
just
raised,
the
incidental
benefit
to
the
religion,
i
think
to
exclude
religion
from,
say,
tax
exempt
statutes
would
be
showing
some
type
of
hostility.
if
you
are
going
to
exempt
other
nonprofit
organizations
from
the
tax
rules,
then
to
turn
around
and
tax
churches
and
other
religious
entities,
i
think
you
would
be
showing
some
form
of
hostility,
and
i
think
it
still
crosses
the
line
of
neutrality.
so
i
would
see...
i
would
see
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
that
incidental
benefit
to
religion.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
that's
a
difficult
question.
the
alabama
situation
is,
in
my
mind,
a
lot
clearer
than
other
states,
but
i
would
venture,
my
opinion
would
be
that
if
you
are
saying
that
by
giving
children
a
moment
of
silence
for
meditation
to
do
whatever
they
will,
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
need
for
adding
the
word
"prayer",
and
i
think
even
those
statutes
in
other
states
would
also
be
constitutionally
infirm.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
yes.
i
think
if
the
perception
among
the
citizens
of
a
particular
state
is
that
by
singling
out
one
particular
activity
in
addition
to
meditation,
but
one
specific
activity
that
can
be
engaged
in
during
that
what,
that
one
moment
involves
the
state
in
religious
matters.
mr.
ronnie
l.
williams
i
think
it
would
be
consistent.
i
think
my
response
was
that
a
child,
or
the
teacher
should
be
responsive
to
any
question
from
a
student.
you
do
not
have
the
routine,
although
this
statute
is
impermissive,
but
you
do
not
have
the
possibility,
i
guess,
of
every
day
a
student
asking
the
same
question,
can
we
pray.
the
teacher
announces
a
moment
of
silence
for
meditation,
and
i
think
throughout
that
school
year
you
would
not
have
someone
in
that
same
class
asking
that
same
question.
i
think
once
that
question
is
asked
and
once
it
is
answered
by
the
teacher
on
one
occasion,
assuming
this
takes
place
in
the
same
class
with
the
same
people,
i
think
the
teacher
has
satisfied
that
inquiry
and
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
on
that
subject.
but
to
each
day
have
a
teacher
to
remind
the
students
that
you
can
pray
during
this
moment
of
silence
i
think
is
going
too
far.
and
i
would
just
like
to
repeat,
i
think
i
may
have
glossed
over
the
point
earlier,
but
particularly
when
you
have
impressionable
minds,
you
have
a
captive
audience,
i
think
it
is
even
more
important,
and
this
court
has
saw
fit
to
see
it
that
way
as
well,
that
it
is
even
more
important
to
protect
young
people
from
this
type
of
behavior,
from
the
state
involving
itself
in
religion.
adults
obviously
can
pick
and
choose
between
beliefs,
philosophies
and
whatever.
young
children
do
not
have
that
capability
to
ferret
out
what
they
feel
is
unacceptable
and
to...
or
what
is
consistent
with
what
they
are
being
taught
at
home.
that
was
precisely
the
situation
with
the
jaffree
family.
the
children
were
being
taught
one
thing
at
home
and
something
else
in
the
public
school
room,
and
it
is
just
not
the
business
of
the
state
to
engage
in
that
type
of
activity.
thank
you.
