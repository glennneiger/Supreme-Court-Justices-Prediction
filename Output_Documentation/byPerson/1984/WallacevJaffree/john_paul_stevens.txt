justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
before
you
get
into
your
argument?
justice
stevens
as
to
the...
similar
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
earlier
statute,
'78
statute,
says
that
teachers
shall
announce.
justice
stevens
whereas
this
one,
the
second
statute,
does
not
say
that.
does
the
first
statute
remain
in
effect?
is
there
still
a
duty
to
announce?
justice
stevens
but
in
the
earlier
statute,
the
one
not
challenged,
the
teacher
was
under
an
obligation,
a
mandatory
obligation
to
make
this
announcement.
and
is
that
still
true?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
here,
too,
because
you
point
out
there
is
a
very
narrow
difference
between
the
two
statutes
in
constitutional
terms.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
practical
difference
between
the
two?
what
has
the
legislature
accomplished
by
passing
the
second
statute?
justice
stevens
mr.
baker,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
because
i
am
still
troubled
by
the
narrow
difference
between
the
two
statutes.
you
say
the
idea
of
the
sponsor
was
to
make
sure
that
prayer
was
a
permissible
activity
pursuant
to
the
statute.
justice
stevens
is
that...
is
it
your
view
that
the
students
in
the
classroom
are
aware
of
that
purpose?
justice
stevens
that
that's
the
difference
between
the
way
it
used
to
be
before
1981
and
the
way
it
is
after
1981?
justice
stevens
so
we
don't
know
as
a
practical
matter
whether
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
in
their
practical
operation.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
why
you
say
they
will
be
standing?
the
statute
doesn't
say
what
the
posture
of
the
people
will
be.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
would
the
state's
purpose
be
equally
well
served
by
a
statute
that
allowed
this
moment
or
two
or
three
moments
immediately
before
school
commenced
so
that
it
would
be
totally
optional
as
to
whether
to
attend
or
not?
justice
stevens
my
question
was
whether
you
think
the
state's
purpose
would
be
equally
well
served
by
such
a
statute.
justice
stevens
the
question
is
whether
you
think
it
would
be
equally
well
served
by
such
a
statute.
justice
stevens
you
are
not
willing
to
answer
my
question,
i
guess,
whether
you
as
advocating
the
constitutionality
of
this
type
of
statute
think
that
the
state's
purpose
would
be
equally
well
served
by
such
a
statute.
justice
stevens
mr.
bator,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
the
point
you
are
making.
is
it
made
easier
by
the
1978
statute
or
by
the
1981
statute?
justice
stevens
and
you
think
the
difference
between
a
moment
of
meditation
and
the
wording
in
the
other
is
what
creates
this
change.
justice
stevens
and
you
said,
when
you
mentioned
the
three
points...
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
a
chance
to
ask
you
this...
that
there
was
an
informational
purpose
to
the
new
statute
because
it
added
the
word
"prayer".
to
whom
in
your
view
was
that
information
conveyed?
justice
stevens
and
there
was
information
conveyed
to
the
students,
to
the
teachers,
or
to
the
citizenry
at
large?
justice
stevens
no,
you
said
there
was
a
change.
you
said
the
informational
point
was
a
difference,
and
i
want
to
know
in
your
view
to
whom
was
that
message
sent.
justice
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
that
message
did
or
did
not
reach
the
students
in
the
classroom?
justice
stevens
i
am
just
trying
to
understand
what
your
point
was
about
this
informational
purpose
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
which
they
could
have
done
under
the
old
statute.
justice
stevens
but
you
are
saying
this
statute
is
different
because
of
its
informational
content,
and
i
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
bator,
the
question
is
whether
the
new
statute
and
the
difference
between
the
new
and
the
old,
is
subject
to
attack
or
not,
and
you
are...
all
of
your
arguments
would
apply
to
the
earlier
statute.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
the
new
statute
accomplished
any
significant
legislative
purpose,
and
if
so,
what?
justice
stevens
mr.
williams,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
difference
between
the
two
statutes
again,
as
a
practical
matter?
how
do
we
know
that
the
children
of
mr.
jaffree,
when
they
go
to
school,
will
encounter
any
different
practice
by
the
teacher,
whether
one
or
both
statutes
are
in
effect?
does
the
statute
cause
anything
different
to
happen
in
the
classroom
of
the
people
who
are
parties
to
this
lawsuit
than
if
the
statute
were
not
on
the
books?
justice
stevens
well,
how
do
we
know
the
teacher
is
going
to
suggest
that?
the
statute
doesn't
require
the
testimony
to
say
a
word
about
prayer.
justice
stevens
could
not
the
teacher
comply
with
the
new
statute
by
continuing
to
follow
whatever
practice
he
or
she
followed
under
the
old
statute?
justice
stevens
then
how
does
the
new
statute
hurt
your
clients?
justice
stevens
mr.
baker,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
reference
to
32(f)
there,
which
reads
that
pursuant
to
the
grant
of
authority
contained
in
16-1-20.1,
defendants,
and
they
name
the
teachers,
have
led
their
classes
in
religiously
based
prayer
activities.
is
that
a
fair
description
of
what
this
statute
authorizes?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
how
do
we...
so
you
don't
admit
that
is
a
correct
allegation.
how
does
that
save
it
from
being
no
case
or
controversy
then?
would
you...
does
this
or
does
this
not
reflect
what
the
statute
intends?
justice
stevens
under
your
view,
does
anything
different
happen
under
the
statute
under
attack
in
this
case
than
happened
under
the
prior
statute?
justice
stevens
no,
the
'78
one.
justice
stevens
well,
then,
where
is
the
case
or
controversy?
justice
stevens
well,
nothing
in
the
'78
statute
forbade
them
from
allowing
silent
prayer,
did
it?
