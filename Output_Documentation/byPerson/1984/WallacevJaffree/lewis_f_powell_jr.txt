mr.
williams--
justice
jr.
--may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
jr.
what
establishment
of
religion
do
you
think
this
statute
promotes?
justice
jr.
the
christian
religion?
justice
jr.
what
was
your
answer?
i
didn't
hear.
justice
jr.
how
many
religious
faiths
are
practiced
in
alabama?
justice
jr.
do
you
know
how
many
religious
faiths
are
practiced
in
alabama?
justice
jr.
there
would
be
hundreds,
wouldn't
there?
justice
jr.
any
particular
one
of
those
furthered
by
this
statute?
justice
jr.
this
big...
the
first
amendment
doesn't
say
that.
the
first
amendment
says
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion.
that
was
written
with
the
church
of
england
in
mind.
so
i
return
to
my
question,
does
this
statute
further
any
establishment
of
religion?
justice
jr.
which
one?
justice
jr.
it
furthers
all
of
them?
justice
jr.
it
furthers
several
hundred
establishments.
justice
jr.
do
you
think
that
is
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
jr.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
certainly
has
a
duty
to,
as
you
have
already
recognized,
to
make
sure
that
people
have
their
right
to
exercise
whichever
religion
they
prefer.
could
you
construe
this
statute
as
having
that
as
a
primary
purpose.
justice
jr.
go
right
ahead.
i
would
be
interested
in
your
response.
justice
jr.
as
sort
of
a
practical
matter,
do
you
think
many
children
of
school
age
are
going
to
be
thinking
about
prayer
when
they
have
this
moment
of
silence,
or
will
they
be
thinking
about
the
next
athletic
contest
or
the
next
date
or
the
next
party
or
whatever?
there
is
no
compulsion
of
any
kind
to
think
about
anything.
you
could
doze.
justice
jr.
mr.
williams,
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
special
exemptions
for
churches
and
religions,
and
local
statutes
provide
exemption
from
property
taxation
for
churches.
would
you
consider
that
those
types
of
legislative
provisions
are
compatible
with
your
position,
or
would
you
hold,
if
you
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so,
that
all
of
those
statute
are
invalid?
justice
jr.
you
think
they
do
not
promote
religion
to
the
same
extent,
perhaps
a
far
greater
extent
than
this
little
statute
that
you
are
debating
here
today?
justice
jr.
is
there
incidental
benefit
to
being
tax
exempt?
justice
jr.
i'd
like
to
enjoy
it.

well,
didn't
the
district
judge
say
that
he
thought
that
this
court
had
been
completely
misguided
in
all
of
these
cases,
that
is,
the
provision
of
textbooks
for
catholic
schools,
the
provision
of
transportation
to
catholic
schools
and
all
the
other
fringe
benefits,
he
thought
this
court
was
just
dead
wrong,
didn't
he,
and
said
so.
