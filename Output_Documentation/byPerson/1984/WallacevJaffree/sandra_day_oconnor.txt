justice
o'connor
mr.
baker,
may
i
inquire
of
whether
the
statute
that
alabama
already
had
providing
for
a
period
of
silence
not
to
exceed
a
minute
would
have
been
violated
under
state
law
by
the
use
of
that
statute
for
silent
prayer?
justice
o'connor
mr.
bator,
that
judgment
or
injunction
does
not
extend
to
the
earlier
statute,
i
take
it.
no.
justice
o'connor
mr.
williams,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
earlier
statute
is
invalid
on
its
face,
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
know
officially
you
haven't,
but
i
am
asking
you
whether
you
believe
it
is
valid,
facially,
the
earlier
statute?
justice
o'connor
mr.
williams,
do
you
think
that
every
statute
that
is
worded
in
the
terms
of
this
one
would
be
invalid
facially
regardless
of
the
evidence
surrounding
the
purpose
of
its
adoption?
justice
o'connor
your
answer
then
is
that
you
think
that
a
statute
worded
as
this
one
would
be
constitutionally
invalid
regardless
of
the
evidence
surrounding
the
intention
of
its
adoption.
justice
o'connor
is
that
consistent
with
your
response
to
justice
white's
question
that
it
would
be
constitutionally
valid
for
a
teacher
to
inform
the
students
that
they
may
use
the
moment
to
pray?
