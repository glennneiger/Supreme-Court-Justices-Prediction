mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
statute
providing
a
minute
of
silence
for
meditation
or
voluntary
prayer
constitutes
an
establishment
of
religion,
or
whether
it
constitutes
a
common
sense
accommodation
of
the
religious
diversity
of
our
people
which
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
religion
causes.
alabama
statute
provides
an
opportunity
to
pray
for
so
minded
students,
but
this
opportunity
to
pray
is
one
that
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
this
court's
cases
under
the
establishment
clauses.
moreover,
we
submit
that
this
type
of
accommodation
is
one
that
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
religion
clauses
in
that
it
promotes
pluralism
which
pervades
both
of
the
religion
clauses.
this
type
of
a
statute
involves
none
of
the
circumstances
that
have
concerned
this
court
in
prior
cases.
this
kind
of
a
statute
does
not
endorse
religion,
it
does
not
endorse
one
religion
over
another,
it
does
not
endorse
belief
over
nonbelief.
this
kind
of
a
statute
is
perfectly
neutral
on
its
face.
the
statute
is
one
that
does
not
coerce
in
any
way;
it
coerces
only
silence.
it
does
not
coerce
any
religious
practice,
it
does
not
coerce
religious
belief,
it
does
not
affirm
religious
belief.
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
statute
neutral
in
that
it
respects
the
consciences
of
all
students
equally
by
allowing
them
either
at
their
own
choice
to
say
a
prayer
in
silence
or
to
say
or
simply
to
meditate
during
this
one
moment,
this
one
minute
at
the
beginning
of
the
day.
in
addition
to
alabama,
there
are
23
other
states
that
have
found
that
providing
a
moment
of
silence
is
a
reasonable
way
to
accommodate
the
various
desires
and
needs
of
children
in
the
public
schools
in
a
way
that
the
states
have
deemed
to
be
consistent
with
the
case
law
in
this
court.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
alabama
had
several
statutes--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--they
were
not
passed
as
a
package,
your
honor.
they
were
passed
in
various
years.
there
was
first
of
all
a
moment
of
silence
statute
passed
in
1978.
there
was
this
statute
which
was
passed
in
1981.
there
was
a
prayer
statute
which
was
struck
down
by
the
eleventh
circuit
which
was
passed
in
1982,
but
they
were
not
presented
as
a
package.
they
were
lumped
together
in
the
course
of
litigation,
your
honor,
yes.
the
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
massachusetts,
you
will
find
that
there
are
certain
parallels.
massachusetts
started
out
with
a
moment
of
silence
statute
in
1966.
they
later
amended
that
statute
to
add
meditation
or
prayer,
and
later
on
they
also
attempted
later
on
to
amend
the
statute--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
true
of
all
the
other
states.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
the
issue
in
this--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--no,
it
would
not
have,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
appellee
concedes
that
the
1978
statute
which
provided
for
a
minute
of
silence
simply
for
meditation
is
perfectly
constitutional.
really,
the
difference
between
the
appellee
and
ourselves
in
this
case
comes
down
to
the
word
"prayer"
in
the
statute.
first
of
all,
the
appellee
proceeds--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--justice
stevens,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
your
honor,
the
first
statute
is
still
in
effect,
but
the
statutes
are
basically
self-executing
in
the
sense
that
the
state
board
of
education
does
not
enforce
the
statutes.
there
are
several
references
to
this
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
it
is
still
true,
your
honor,
but
just
to
add,
the
first
statute
was
in
fact
originally
challenged
by
the
appellee
in
his
second
amendment
complaint.
he
later
dropped
that
challenge
and
now
concedes
the
constitutionality
of
that
first
statute.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
the
difference
between
the
appellee
and
our
own
position
on
this
question
really
comes
down
to
the
significance
of
the
word
"prayer"
in
the
statute.
as
i
have
already
said,
the
appellee
concedes
the
constitutionality
of
the
moment
of
silence
statute
for
meditation,
and
the
appellee
also
concedes
that
students
have
a
right
to
pray
silently
to
themselves
at
any
time
that
they
would
wish
to
during
the
school
day.
obviously,
then,
during
this
one
minute
of
silence,
the
students,
even
under
the
1978
statute,
the
statute
providing
only
for
silent
meditation,
the
student
would
have
the
right
during
that
minute
to
pray
silently.
in
other
words,
the
effect
under
either
statute,
under
the
1978
statute
or
the
1981
statute,
is
the
same
as
far
as
the
classroom
goes.
the
difference
comes
down
to
that
one-word
prayer
in
the
statute,
but
certainly
it
cannot
be
unconstitutional
simply
to
insert
in
a
statute
a
statement
that
it
is
constitutional...
what
is
constitutionally
permissible.
in
other
words,
the
statute
merely
informs
students
that
one
of
the
purposes
that
they
can
put
this
minute
of
silence
to
is
that
they
can
use
it
to
pray
silently
during
that
minute.
this
opportunity
for
prayer
is
not,
as
the
appellee
has
suggested,
one
of
group
prayer.
we
have
here
none
of
the
characteristics
of
group
prayer.
it
is
not
vocal
prayer.
no
one
student
knows
what
another
student
is
saying,
is
thinking,
or
whether
that
student
is
praying,
whether
the
student
is
meditating,
whether
the
student
is
simply
vegetating
for
that
one
minute.
because
no
student
knows
what
another
student
is
doing
during
that
period
of
time,
there
is
not
the
problem
of
coercion
that
concerned
this
court
in
earlier
cases.
we
do
not
have
here
a
joint
effort
or
joint
purpose
as
among
the
various
students
in
the
classroom
for
that
one
minute.
there
is,
in
other
words,
no
communal
effort.
it
does
not
involve
any
of
the
characteristics
that
this
court
discussed
in
engel
and
in
shemp,
and
we
submit
on
this
basis
that
this
statute
is
essentially
different.
by
providing
an
opportunity
to
pray,
we
submit
that
the
statute
is
in
the
line
of
cases
including
zorach
where
this
court
has
recognized
that
it
is
perfectly
consistent
for
states
to
in
certain
areas
accommodate
the
religious
needs
of
our
people.
in
this
area
of
accommodation,
we
find
that
the
statute
accommodates
those
admittedly
who
have
this
desire
to
pray,
but
it
does
so
in
a
way
that
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
free
exercise
of
rights
of
anyone
else
in
the
class.
it
does
not
present
the
problem
of
embarrassment
or
excusing
students
as
was
a
problem
in
the
earlier
cases.
the
statute
does
in
fact,
as
indicated,
leave
to
the
teacher
a
certain
discretion
in
the
sense
that
this
statute
is
permissive.
it
says
that
a
teacher
may
implement
this
minute
of
silence.
this
statute,
however,
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
local
school
boards
in
their
independent
areas
would
or
could
adopt
regulations
dealing
with
the
implementation
of
the
statute.
but
the
sense
of
the
statute
is
that
this
moment
of
silence
should
be
allowed
for
students
who
wish
to
have
their
religious
needs
accommodated
during
the
day.
we
see
no
difference
constitutionally
between
a
statute
which
is
permissive,
as
this
statute
is
in
the
sense
that
it
has
the
word
"may"
in
it,
as
opposed
to
a
statute
which
is
mandatory,
as
was
indicated
in
one
of
the
questions.
we
have
from
the
24
states
that
have
moment
of
silence
statutes,
we
have
a
variety
of
language
in
those
statutes.
in
some
of
the
states
the
decision
is
made
by
the
state
legislature.
in
other
states
the
decision
is
made
by
the
state
school
board
or
the
local
school
board.
it
may
be
made
by
the
principal.
it
may
be
made
by
the
teacher.
in
viewing
these
statutes
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
we
have
24
states
which
have
deemed
this
to
be
a
proper,
reasonable
way
to
accommodate,
we
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
there
are
various
conditions
from
state
to
state,
and
that
the
statute
may
in
fact
be
implemented
in
somewhat
a
different
way
in
various
states
depending
upon
the
local
needs.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
your
honor,
it
was
very
clear
from
the
testimony
of
the
sponsoring
legislator
here
that
he
was
concerned
that
people
did
not
understand
that
they
had
a
right
to
pray
silently
in
the
classroom,
and
many
people
are
under
the
impression
apparently
that
students
no
longer
even
have
the
right
to
pray
silently.
what
this
statute
does
is
to
clarify
that
and
make
it
very
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
this
is
one
of
the
uses
to
which
the
minute
of
silence
can
be
put.
it
does
so
in
a
way
that
is
neutral
because
it
at
the
same
time
emphasizes
the
word
"meditation"
already
in
the
statute.
this
statute,
this
opportunity
to
pray,
was
struck
down
by
the
eleventh
circuit
on
its
face
in
this
case.
the
eleventh
circuit
recognized
that
the
teacher
activity
in
mobile,
in
the
mobile
schools
that
were
challenged
in
the
other
part
of
the
case
were
not
related
to
this
statute.
we
thus
have
in
this
case
no
real
experience;
there
is
nothing
indicated
on
the
record
in
this
case
as
to
the
implementation
of
this
kind
of
statute.
and
we
submit
that
at
this
point,
that
this
court
ought
to
allow
and
recognize
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
and
allow
for
it
to
be
implemented.
we
recognize
that
any
sort
of
statute
which
deals
with
the
area
of
prayer
is
one
that
is
obviously
a
controversial
one,
and
there--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
aware
of
the
purpose
that
that
is
a--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--there's
no
indication
in
mobile,
for
instance,
that
either
statute
has
ever
been
implemented.
in
fact,
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
to
the
effect
that
neither
statute
has
been
implemented,
so
that
we
have
no
experience
in
this
record
on
either
the
moment
of
silence
statute
or
the
meditation
or
prayer
statute.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
not
on
this
record
we
do
not,
your
honor.
this
opportunity
to
pray,
we
submit
to
the
court,
is
one
that
is
consistent
with
this
court's
cases
dealing
with
the
notion
of
accommodation,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
lynch
v.
donnelly,
the
constitution
affirmatively
mandates
accommodation,
not
merely
a
tolerance
of
all
religions,
and
forbids
hostility
towards
none.
we
submit
that
this
kind
of
a
statute
is
that
type
of
accommodation
which
accommodates
those
who
feel
in
conscience
compelled
to
dedicate
their
day
at
the
opening
with
a
brief
moment
of
prayer,
while
at
the
same
time
allowing
other
students
to
silently
reflect
during
that
minute,
and
in
no
way
does
the
statute
involve
any
sort
of--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--that
student
can
simply
stand
there
for
one
minute,
your
honor.
during
that
minute
he
is
in
no
way
embarrassed,
he
is
in
no
way
coerced
to
do
anything.
the
only
coercion
involved
on
the
student
during
that
minute
is
that
he
engage
in
no
activity.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
he
is
simply
standing
there
during
a
moment
of
silence.
that
moment
of
silence
is
obviously
applicable
to
everyone.
the
only
group
unity
here
is
the
unity
of
silence
for
one
minute.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
you
are
perfectly
correct,
your
honor,
you
are
perfectly
correct.
it
could
be
that
they
would
be
sitting
during
that
period
of
time,
depending
upon
whatever
the
teacher's
normal
course
of
opening
the
day
would
be,
assuming
pledge
of
allegiance
and
other
opening
activities.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
the
statute
does
not
indicate
any
order,
your
honor.
that
is
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
teacher
as
to
how
it
would
be
implemented.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
your
honor,
the
statute
does
deal
only
with
one
minute
and
not
five
minutes.
certainly
the
longer
a
statute
goes,
the
more
you
get
into
the
question
of
how
long
is
an
appropriate
time.
but
when
we
compare
this,
for
instance,
to
the
zorach
case
where
you
release
students
for
an
hour
a
week,
it
seems
that
one
minute
a
day
does
not
appear
to
be
unreasonable
at
all.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
raises
the
question
of
equal
access,
which
is
not
this
statute,
it
is
a
different
statute.
i
think
that
that
kind
of
a
statute
would
be
perfectly
constitutional,
but
that
is
a
different
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
that
might
be
one
of
the
ways
to
serve
it,
and
i
think
it
would
be
constitutional,
but
i
think
this
is
equally--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
policy
judgment
for
the
legislature
to
make.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
i
think
there
are
some
students
who
want
to
start
the
main
work
of
the
day
during
a
minute
of
silence,
and
prior
to
class
that
is
not
starting
the
main
work
of
the
day.
so
i
think
there
is
a
slightly
different
purpose,
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
just
briefly,
your
honor.
we
would
like
to
emphasize
that
there
is
a
case
in
controversy
here
because
in
the
second
amended
petition,
the
appellee
did
allege
that
the
statute
was
being
used,
and
it
was
under
that
that
there
was
praying
going
on
in
the
schools.
we
have
a
situation--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
it
is
on
page
25
of
the
joint
appendix,
paragraph
32(f).
he
makes
that
allegation.
we
have
a
situation
now,
your
honor,
where
we
have
a
statute
conceded
to
be
valid
regarding
a
minute
of
silence,
and
a
teacher
now
is
facing
the
dilemma
when
he
or
she
announces
that
minute
of
silence
whether
he
or
she
as
to
do
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
namely,
inform
the
students
that
they
cannot
pray
because
of
the
situation
where
she
is
fearing
or
he
is
fearing
the
possibility
of
a
lawsuit
here
for
violating
the
injunction
against
the
minute
of
silence
for
meditation
or
prayer.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
the
intent
of
the
statute,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
appellee
has
tried
to
narrow
the
issue
under
this
statute
just
to
the
issue
of
prayer,
one
could
make
the
allegation
pursuant
to
subparagraph
(f)
that
by
using
this
minute
of
silence
to
allow
prayer,
that
it
constitutes
an
exercise,
and
the
appellee
has
made
the
allegation
in
his
brief
that
this
does
constitute
a
religious
exercise.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
when
you
say
the
prior
statute,
do
you
mean
the
'82
one
or
the--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--'78?
the
effect
is
no
different,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
the
case
or
controversy
goes
to
the
face
of
the
statute
and
the
word
"prayer"
in
there,
and
the
problem
for
the
teacher
as
to
whether
they
can
allow
silent
prayer,
as
indicated
by--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--but
the
dilemma
for
the
teacher
is
whether
they
have
an
affirmative
duty
now
to
state
that
this
minute
in
response
to
a
question
can
or
cannot
be
used
for
prayer.
thank
you,
your
honor.
