of
course,
some
of
those
other
states
didn't
have
your
accompanying
statutes,
did
they,
the
ones
that
have
been
declared
invalid.
justice
blackmun
--had
a
package.
alabama
had
rather
a
package.
justice
blackmun
well,
my
only
point
is
that
your
alabama
situation
may
be
somewhat
different
from
massachusetts
or
some
of
the
others
which
have
just
the
single
statute.
justice
blackmun
is
this
true
of
all
the
other
36
states?
justice
blackmun
i
didn't
think
it
was.
justice
blackmun
they
would
stand
for
the
pledge
of
allegiance,
i
suppose,
and
then
maybe
continue
this,
or
would
the
prayer
come
first,
the
moment
of
silence
come
first?
justice
blackmun
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
statute
said
not
exceeding
five
minutes?
