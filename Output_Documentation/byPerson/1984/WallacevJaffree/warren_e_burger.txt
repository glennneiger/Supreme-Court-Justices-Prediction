we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
wallace
v.
jaffree
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
baker,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

e.

mr.
bator?
chief
justice
burger
on
the
point
that
was
raised
in
some
of
the
earlier
questions,
mr.
bator,
is
there
any
mechanism
by
which
the
state
of
alabama
could
have
applied
to
some
court
for
a
construction
of
this
statute
in
order
to
enable
the
state
to
instruct
its
teachers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
williams?
chief
justice
burger
mr.
williams,
suppose
the
teacher
said
at
the
opening
of
the
class,
we
now
have
a
moment
when
we
will
all
remain
silent
to
collect
your
thoughts
and
think
about
why
you
are
here
in
school,
any
problems
with
that?
chief
justice
burger
mm-hmm.
aren't
they
free
to
do
just
that?
chief
justice
burger
is
she
telling
them
any
more
than
the
first
amendment
guarantees
to
every
person
in
this
country,
man,
woman
and
child?
chief
justice
burger
well,
aren't
we
supposed
to
be
teaching
the
children
about
the
constitution
and
about
freedom
of
press
and
freedom
of
speech?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think...
do
you
think
the
teacher
could
tell
the
children,
you
may
meditate,
but
you
may
not
pray
silently?
chief
justice
burger
well,
in
the
long
run,
mr.
williams,
to
go
back
to
that
point,
is
the
teacher
telling
the
students
if
they
do
so
any
more
than
what
the
constitution
guarantees,
that
is,
that
they
may
indulge
in
a
few
moments
of
silent
prayer
if
they
want
to?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
the
teacher
tells
them
while
you
are
in
the
classroom
you
may
not
whisper
or
speak
to
the
other
students,
you
will
only
speak
when
you
are
called
upon,
but
when
you
go
out
on
the
playground
or
out
in
the
hall,
then
the
constitution
guarantees
you
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech?
anything
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
burger
there
is
no
religious
aspect
to
that,
of
course,
but--
chief
justice
burger
--in
either
situation
of
these
two
postulated
statements,
a
statement
of
what
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
guarantees,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
you
may
speak,
you
may
pray.
chief
justice
burger
but
you
don't
agree
with
the
district
judge
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
baker?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
