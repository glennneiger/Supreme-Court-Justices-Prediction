justice
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
you
agree
that
the
proper
standard
for
review
is
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard?
justice
o'connor
you
just
think
it
wasn't
applied
properly
here?
justice
o'connor
last
term
in
phinpathya,
the
court
said
it
was
entirely
within
the
board's
discretion.
justice
o'connor
so
i
think
the
language
has
been
very
broad
and
makes
it
very
difficult
to
justify
the
eighth
circuit's
approach.
justice
o'connor
but
congress
didn't
even
require
motions
for
rehearing
to
be
granted
or
considered.
so
it's
just,
you're
a
step
removed
from
that.
