mr.
horowitz,
that's
by
regulation,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
and
i
suppose
the
service
could...
the
attorney
general
could
revoke
that
regulation
if
he
wanted
to?
justice
blackmun
well,
i
suppose
if
the
decision
was
made
purely
on
the
basis
of
race
there
would
be
some
problem.
justice
blackmun
and
then
the
eighth
circuit
on
the
first
go-around
sat
on
it
for
a
solid
year.
do
you
know
why?
justice
blackmun
and
a
three
or
four-page
opinion
for
a
whole
year.
in
the
second
go-around
they
sat
on
it
for
eight
months.
justice
blackmun
are
they
that
far
behind?
it's
not
your
part
of
the
country.
