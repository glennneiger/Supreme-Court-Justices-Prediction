justice
stevens
it
didn't
ask
it,
mr.
horowitz.
it
said
the
board
shall
promptly
consider
and
rule
upon,
is
the
language
at
the
end
of
the
opinion.
justice
stevens
did
the
board
do
that?
did
the
board
carry
out
that
mandate?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you...
i'm
sorry...
if
the
grounds
on
which
it
denied
the
reopening
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
relied
on
anything
that
was
not
before
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
time
of
its
decision?
they
knew
about
the
time
that
had
been
taken,
they
knew
about
the
smuggling.
justice
stevens
how
much
time
elapsed
because
of
the
filing?
i
kind
of
lost
track,
the
filing
of
the
frivolous
appeals.
almost
three
years,
wasn't
it?
why
does
it
take
so
long...
why
did
it
take
so
long
to
dispose
of
the
appeals.
is
that
time
all
chargeable
to
the
respondents
or
has
the
government
got
to
share
some
responsibility
for
that?
justice
stevens
it
takes
them
that
long
to
decide
frivolous
cases?
justice
stevens
and
therefore
you
could
say,
well,
the
time
was
accumulated
by
litigation,
even
though
prosecuted
in
good
faith
and
with
substantial
questions
raised.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
true
in
this
case,
though,
that
this
issue
about
the
american
children
had
never
been
decided
by
this
court,
at
least.
i
guess
it
had
been
decided
a
couple
of
times
by
lower
courts.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
about
the
other
half
of
your
abuse
of
discretion
argument,
the
fact
that
they
had
violated
the
immigration
laws
when
they
came
in,
which
i
guess
is
the...
that
plus
the
delay
are
your
two
factors.
isn't
that
always
true
in
deportation
cases,
and
if
so,
is
it
a
fair
factor
to
use,
because
doesn't
it
just
mean
you
can
use
it
when
you
want
to
and
you
don't
use
it
when
you
don't
want
to?
justice
stevens
you
mean
that's
worse
than
swimming
across
the
river?
justice
stevens
but
there's
surely
premeditation
in
both
cases.
justice
stevens
well,
is
it
even
clear
if
it
were
made
on
the
basis
of
race
it
couldn't
be
done?
at
one
time
immigration
policy
did
divide
people
up
by
nationality
and
different
parts
of
the
world.
say
they
decided
to
exclude
all
orientals,
for
example.
justice
stevens
i
just
wonder
if
your
position
really
isn't,
just
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
there's
absolutely
no
limit
on
this
discretion?
justice
stevens
it
would
fit
the
statute.
justice
stevens
would
it
be
an
abuse
to
have
a
policy,
no
more
mexican
nationals?
we
deport
all
mexican
nationals;
we've
got
too
many
in
this
country.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
jay
against
boyd,
which
i
hadn't
read
before
the
argument
and
i've
just
read
it,
and
the
scope
of
the
discretion
in
the
case.
the
analogy
that
the
court
made
in
that
case,
which
is
quite
interesting,
is
to
the
probation
proceedings,
which
in
1955
were
proceedings
in
which
there
was
total
discretion
by
the
authority
that
had
discretion
to
grant
or
revoke
probation
or
parole.
has
anybody
ever
argued
that,
just
as
the
law
of
parole
has
changed,
that
maybe
the
rules
here
also
require
the
same
kind
of
procedures?
justice
stevens
if
you
make
that
argument,
then
you're
basically...
it's
basically
a
procedural
argument.
justice
stevens
and
then
what's
wrong
with
the
procedure
that
the
attorney
general
did
follow?
because
maybe
you
don't
like
his
reasons,
but
he
did
tell
us
what
they
were.
and
maybe
they're
pretty
weak,
but
you
can't
say
it's
totally
arbitrary
to
say
somebody
who
gets
extra
time
by
litigating
to
get
it
is--
justice
stevens
--but
why
can't
he
say
that
the
time
that's
gained
by
appeals
that
we
think
are
frivolous
are
enough?
why
can't
they
define
their
own
standard
of
frivolity,
frivolousness,
whatever
the
right
word
is?
justice
stevens
can
i
ask
you
just
one
quick
question.
do
you
think
the
jay
against
boyd
case
is
good
law,
if
it
relies
on
a
parole
analogy
and
if
the
facts
of
that
case
were
they
could
rely
on
ex
parte
evidence
for
their
decision,
which
i
wonder
if
it
could
be
done
by
a
parole
board
now?
well,
it
isn't
good
law
under
what
the
attorney
general
has
done.
you
agree
that
you've
provided
for
reopenings
and
you've
provided
for
discretion
and
you
think
your
discretion
is
reviewable.
justice
stevens
that's
really
what
i
was
asking
your
opponent.
i
wonder
what
your
view
is.
if
you
comply
with
all
the
procedures
that
are
required
for
a
fair
hearing
comparable
to
a
parole
proceeding,
would
you
say
you've
done
everything
that
would
be
reviewable,
that
the
only
thing
that's
reviewable
is
procedural
fairness?
justice
stevens
we
don't
like
the
color
of
your
eyes.
