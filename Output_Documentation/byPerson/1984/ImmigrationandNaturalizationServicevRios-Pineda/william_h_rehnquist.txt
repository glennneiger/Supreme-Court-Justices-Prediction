justice
rehnquist
but
the
board
in
this
court
isn't
bound
by
any
law
of
the
case
doctrine
of
the
eighth
circuit,
is
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
can
the
court
of
appeals
vacate
a
decision
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
without
holding
anything?
it's
not
easy,
at
any
rate.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
there
was
a
petition
to
review
the
decision
of
the
ins
in
the
first
court
of
appeals
case,
and
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
hold
anything
but
simply
directed
the
ins
to
consider
a
petition
to
reopen.
well,
they
have
to
hold
that
something
the
ins
did
was
improper,
don't
they,
to
come
to
that
conclusion?
otherwise
they'd
have
to
affirm
it.
justice
rehnquist
did
he
win
the
appeal?
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
the
board
have
any
flat
policy
as
to
when
the
necessary
seven-year
period
stops
running?
i
mean,
could
the
board
take
the
position
under
the
statute
that
at
the
time
the
deportation
proceedings
is
brought
that's
the
end
of
the
seven-year
period?
any
time
after
that
engaged
in
litigation
simply
can't
be
counted
towards
the
seven
years?
justice
rehnquist
even
though
part
of
the
time
results
from
litigation
by
the
deportee?
justice
rehnquist
i'm
sorry.
had
you
finished
your
answer?
i
did
have...
i
wanted
to
just
think
through
this
one
thing.
you
rely
on
the
frivolous
character
of
the
appeals
in
your
brief,
and
one
of
the
issues
i
guess
is
whether
the
fact
that
the
two
children
are
american
citizens
would
somehow
give
them
some
kind
of
a
legal
argument.
i
gather
your
position
is,
even
if
the
appeals
raised
very
close
constitutional,
important
questions,
you'd
still
have
the
same
discretion?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
again
would
be
the
basis
for
the
attorney
general's
suspending
deportation
in
this
case?
what
does
the
regulation
say?
is
it
hardship?
justice
rehnquist
and
this
is
just
totally
a
matter
of
discretion,
is
it
not,
with
the
attorney
general?
justice
rehnquist
well
then,
why
does
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
right
to
review
it
at
all?
why
do
you
say
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
when
there
are
no
standards
for
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
in
the
first
place?
justice
rehnquist
but
here
congress
hasn't
even
set
up
the
remedy.
the
attorney
general
has
set
up
the
remedy.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
petition
to
reopen
is
set
up
by
the
attorney
general.
justice
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
that
be
totally
within
his
discretion?
justice
rehnquist
what
courts
have
found
that?
justice
rehnquist
well,
hasn't
this
court
spoken
of
unfettered
discretion?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
review
under
what
standard?
i
mean,
i
wonder
whether
the
government
isn't
conceding
more
than
it
ought
to
in
this
case.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
cases
from
this
court
do
you
rely
on
for
that
proposition?
you
said
unfettered
discretion
is
what
this
court
has
said.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
said
abuse
of
discretion.
where
does
the
court
of
appeals
derive
that,
what
authority?
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
the
board
say
that
it
was
considering
simply
the
fact
that
they
were
deportable
or
the
fact
that
they
had
been
smuggled
in
illegally?
justice
rehnquist
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
was
not
a
permissible
exercise
of
the
attorney
general's
discretion?
justice
rehnquist
when
you're
dealing
with
unfettered
discretion,
why
should
the
board
have
to
explain
anything
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
it's
not
so
much
a
jurisdictional
question
i
was
asking
about,
but
your
suggestion,
based
on
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
i
realize,
that
the
board
not
only
must
state
reasons
why
it
chooses
not
to
reopen
the
case,
but
has
to
explain
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
of
appeals
why
these
reasons
make
the
case
different
from
some
other
case.
i
mean,
you
can
play
that
game
for
20
years.
justice
rehnquist
but
there's
a
presumption
of
regularity
in
any
administrative
proceeding,
and
surely
the
burden
is
on
the
party
that
wants
to
upset
the
decision
to
show
that
these
people
have
been
treated
differently
from
somebody
else.
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
indicate,
we
see
other
cases
where
you
have
treated
people
different.
they
said
you
have
to
explain
why
this
makes
cases
different
from
other
factual
cases.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
just
reverses
the
ordinary
presumption.
justice
rehnquist
but
can
a
rational
court
of
appeals
fairly
say
that
the
reasons
given
by
the
board
here
don't
make
any
sense
to
us...
smuggled
in,
illegally
entered
the
country,
frivolous
appeals?
it
seems
to
me,
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
was
expressing
kind
of
an
equal
protection
idea,
that
you
may
have
let
other
people
stay
about
whom
these
same
things
could
be
said.
but
now
you
suggest
that
it's
kind
of
a
due
process
thing,
that
no
rational
attorney
general
could
refuse
to
reopen
just
on
these
facts.
i
doubt
that
even
this
court
of
appeals
said
that.
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
did
they
get
the
right
to
impose
that?
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
do
you
get...
at
what
part
of
the
act
do
you
find
that?
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
wang
it
said
broad
discretion.
jay
against
boyd
said
unfettered
discretion.
you
seek
to
draw
from
wang
the
inference
that,
because
the
term
"broad
discretion"
was
used,
the
term
"unfettered
discretion"
has
been
disapproved,
and
that
really
stretches
things.
justice
rehnquist
by
what
standard
should
we
review
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
the
conduct
before
them
and
by
them
wasn't
frivolous?
