mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
attorney
general
has
provided
by
regulation
that
completed
deportation
proceedings
may
be
reopened
in
his
discretion
to
account
for
new
circumstances.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
yes.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
that's
right.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
it's
possible
that
congress
might
want
to
do
something
about
it
at
that
point,
but
certainly
it's
within
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
revoke
the
regulation,
and
the
fact
that
he
himself
promulgated
it
suggests
that
the
attorney
general
is
the
one
who
knows
what
it
means
and
that
he
has
considerable
discretion
in
how
it
is
to
be
applied.
in
addition,
congress
has
granted
the
attorney
general
discretion
to
suspend
the
deportation
of
a
deportable
alien
who
meets
certain
threshold
criteria.
in
this
case,
respondents
have
sought
to
reopen
their
deportation
proceedings
in
order
to
seek
suspension
of
deportation.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
in
exercising
his
twin
discretion
that
i
have
described
the
attorney
general
could
take
into
account
the
fact
that
respondents
achieved
eligibility,
this
threshold
eligibility,
for
suspension
of
deportation
only
by
filing
frivolous
appeals
and
engaged
in
other
conduct
flouting
our
immigration
laws.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
attorney
general
abused
his
discretion
by
taking
these
factors
into
account.
we
have
sought
certiorari
here
because
this
ruling
threatens
substantial
disruption
of
our
immigration
processes.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
i
would
agree
that
that
is
the
proper
standard
of
review.
we
think
that
it
is
quite--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--we
think
if
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
correct
here,
there's
really
no
room
left
at
all
for
the
attorney
general
to
apply
any
discretion,
and
that
to
the
extent
the
opinion
suggests
that
abuse
of
discretion
is
the
correct
standard
the
court
was
really
only
playing
lip
service
to
that
but
in
fact
was
not
applying
it.
in
1974,
with
the
assistance
of
a
professional
smuggler,
both
respondents
entered
the
united
states
without
inspection.
in
1978,
mr.
rios-pineda
was
discovered
by
immigration
officials
and
was
granted
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure.
but
he
did
not
depart
as
promised
and
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
both
respondents.
respondents
conceded
deportability
at
their
deportation
hearing
and
in
december
1978
they
were
ordered
deported.
because
they
had
been
in
the
country
for
only
four
and
a
half
years
and
the
suspension
of
deportation
relief
requires
seven
years
continuous
presence
in
the
united
states,
respondents
were
not
eligible
for
that
relief
and
their
request
for
that
relief
was
denied
at
the
deportation
hearing.
respondents
took
an
immediate
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
raising
several
wholly
unmeritorious
contentions.
and
i
should
perhaps
note
here
that
both
respondents'
brief
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
their
later
brief
to
the
eighth
circuit
are
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix.
in
accordance
with
agency
regulations,
this
appeal
automatically
stayed
respondents'
deportation
order.
when
the
board
dismissed
the
appeal,
respondents
filed
a
petition
for
review
with
the
court
of
appeals
raising
essentially
the
same
contentions.
that
appeal
also
stayed,
automatically
stayed
their
deportation
pursuant
to
statute.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
that's
right.
by
march
of
1982--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--well,
i
think
the
question
here
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
later
decision
in
1983.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
they
ordered--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--well,
no,
i
would
disagree
that
they
ordered
a
reopening.
they
ordered
the
board
to
consider
a
petition
to
reopen,
a
motion
to
reopen,
rather.
the
board
considered
it,
denied
it
for
various
reasons.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
no,
there
was
no
reason
to
appeal,
because
all
they
had
done
was
given
the
respondents
the
opportunity
to
file
a
motion
to
reopen,
which
the
board
is
usually
willing
to
consider,
and
it
asked
the
board
to
consider
it.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
all
right,
ordered
the
board
to
consider
it
and
rule
upon
it.
but
that
is
what
the
board--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--we
think
the
board
carried
out
that
mandate.
it
considered
the
petition...
the
motion,
excuse
me.
it
denied
it
for
several
reasons.
it
found
it
was
filed
in
an
untimely
fashion,
an
issue
that
has
disappeared
from
the
case.
it
also
found
that
the
motion
did
not
make
a
prima
facie
case
of
extreme
hardship.
and
i
think
this
is
the
point
where
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
second
opinion
disagreed
and
found
that
in
its
view
the
first
opinion
had
stated
that
the
respondents
had
already
made
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
no,
the
board's
not
bound
by
a
law
of
the
case
doctrine
in
this
court.
but
i
don't
think
the
law
of
the
case
really
applies
at
all
to
the
issue
that's
presented
here,
even
in
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
i
think
that's
fair
to
say.
we
did
not
think
it
was
inappropriate
that
we
be
asked
to--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--well,
in
general,
when
something
new
comes
up
and
the
court
of
appeals
just
asks
the
board
to
consider
it,
normally
the
board
is
willing
to
do
that,
unless
it
considers
it
completely
unreasonable.
and
i
would
say
they
did
not
consider
the
1982
decision
completely
unreasonable.
i
think,
just
to
clarify
this
law
of
the
case
question,
there
are
two
grounds
for
the
board's
later
denial
of
the
motion
to
reopen.
one
was
that
no
extreme
hardship
has
been
shown.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
on
the
second
appeal
and
found
that
it
had
found
extreme
hardship.
that's
not
really
an
issue
in
the
case
any
more
in
this
court.
but
the
board
separately...
an
independent
ground
for
its
decision
denying
the
motion
to
reopen
was
that,
regardless
of
whether
extreme
hardship
had
been
shown,
it
was
going
to
deny
the
motion
to
reopen
in
its
discretion
because:
a,
the
respondents
had
achieved
their
threshold
eligibility
for
suspense
remedy
only
by
filing
frivolous
appeals;
and
b,
because
they
had
in
other
ways
showed
their
disregard
for
the
immigration
laws,
because
of
their
use
of
a
smuggler
and
because
they
had--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--i'm
sorry,
justice
brennan,
i
did
not
mean
to
give
that
impression.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
the
board
had
to
be
complying
with
the
mandate
of
the
eighth
circuit,
and
i
think
any
fair
reading
of
the
first
eighth
circuit
decision...
this
is
discussed
in
our
petition
more
than
actually
in
our
merits
brief...
is
that
the
board
did
comply
with
the
mandate
of
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
that's
right.
but
the
mandate
of
the
eighth
circuit
was
just
to
allow
respondents
to
file
this
motion
to
reopen
and
then
to
consider
the
motion
to
reopen.
and
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
the
attorney
general
has
considerable
discretion
in
deciding
whether
to
reopen
deportation
proceedings.
he
allowed
them
to
file
the
motion
to
reopen,
he
considered
it.
he
denied
it
for
several
reasons
that
were
stated
in
an
opinion.
that's
all
the
eighth
circuit
asked
him
to
do.
to
the
extent
the
eighth
circuit
later
decided
that
it
had
decided
the
extreme
hardship
the
first
time
around,
it
was
really
reaching
well
beyond
its
powers,
since
extreme
hardship
is
committed
to
the
attorney
general
to
decide
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
none
of
those
reasons
had
been
given
by
the
board
before.
so
although
the
events
that
served
as
the
basis
for
the
board's
later
denial...
that
is,
the
filing
of
the
frivolous
appeals
and
the
disregard
for
the
immigration
laws...
while
those
had
as
a
chronological
matter
already
happened,
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
the
eighth
circuit
was
thinking
about
them.
they
had
not
been
given
as
a
reason
for
any
action
by
the
attorney
general,
and
it
was
only
later
that
this
became
an
issue.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
most
of
it
is
chargeable
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
it
was
about
a
year
from
the
time
this
case
was
argued
in
the
eight
circuit
to
the
time
the
decision
came
down
sending
it
back.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
they
didn't
even
rule
on
the
issues
that
were
before
them.
all
they
did
was
send
it
back
for
further
consideration.
they
may
have
been
holding
it
in
order
to
allow
the
seven
years
to
elapse.
but
there
were
delays,
i
think,
just
throughout
the
administrative
and
judicial
system.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
the
first
time--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--well,
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
we
liked
it,
but
we
would
not
consider
it
a
serious
threat
to
the
immigration
system.
the
first
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
simply
raised
several
contentions
by
respondents
that
we
think
were
frivolous
as
to
why
their
deportation
order
was
incorrect.
they
had
not
been
able
to
apply
for
suspension
of
deportation
earlier
because
they
had
not
met
the
seven
year
requirement.
the
second...
at
the
first
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
it
would
give
respondents
an
opportunity
to
apply
for
this
relief,
now
that
the
seven
years
had
passed.
so
it
simply
sent
the
case
back
to
the
board
to
consider
an
application,
something
that
had
never
been
ruled
on
before.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
the
seven
years
had
been
satisfied
at
that
point.
the
board
denied
the
motion
for
other
reasons,
the
main
reasons
the
ones
that
are
at
issue
here,
that
the
eligibility
had
been
achieved
only
through
these
dilatory
tactics,
filing
frivolous
appeals,
and
because
of
the
other
disregard
for
the
immigration
laws.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
that
is
the
second
board
decision.
that
decision
was
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
second
time
around,
addressing
this
decision
of
the
board
for
the
first
time,
said
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
board
to
rely
on
those
two
factors,
that
the
fact
that
these
appeals
which
completely
lacked
any
substantive
merit
were
the
only
way
in
which
respondents
had
become
eligible
for
this
relief.
that,
the
court
of
appeals
found,
was
irrelevant
and
an
improper
factor
to
be
relied
on.
the
board
couldn't
rely
on
it.
second,
the
fact
that
respondents
had
agreed
to
depart
voluntarily
but
then
not
shown
up
for
voluntary
departure,
the
fact
that
they
hired
a
smuggler
to
bring
them
into
the
country,
these
were
also
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
improper
factors
on
which
the
board
could
not
rely.
the
government
has
serious
problems
with
that
decision
because
in
fact
it
completely
eliminates
any
discretion
for
the
attorney
general
in
ruling
on
these
things.
there
just
aren't
other
factors.
these
are
the
kinds
of
factors
that
the
attorney
general
ought
to
be
relying
on.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
the
order
was
broader.
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
second
time--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--well,
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
different.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
really
hold
anything
the
first
time
around.
all
it
did
was
ask
the
board...
or
order
the
board
to
afford
respondents
an
opportunity
to
seek
administrative
relief.
on
the
second
go-around,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
board
had
erred
and
had
abused
its
discretion.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
i
wouldn't
necessarily
say
that
they
vacated
the
decision,
because
the
premise
of
filing
a
motion
to
reopen
deportation
proceedings
is
that
there
is
an
order
of
deportation
outstanding.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
i
don't
think
they
have
to
hold
that
anything
the
board
had
done
was
improper,
and
they
did
not,
certainly
did
not
hold
that
anything
the
board
had
done
was
improper.
perhaps
what...
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
driving
at,
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
is
true
that
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
did
make
a
mistake
in
the
first
appeal
in
that
they
did
not
really
rule
on
respondents'
appeal,
the
contentions
that
they
had
made.
these
contentions
were
that
the
deportation
order
was
wrong,
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
ruled
on
those
because
that
was
really...
the
respondents
were
asking
for
more
relief
there
than
what
they
got
from
the
court
of
appeals.
so
they
should
have
ruled
on
those
and
rejected
them.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
all
he
won--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--he
didn't
win
the
appeal.
nothing
was
decided
on
the
appeal.
he
just
obtained
the
opportunity
to
go
back
for
further
relief.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
i
think
we're
really
getting
to
the
crux
of
the
case.
all
that
happened
during
the
course
of
the
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
time
passed,
three
and
a
half
years
passed.
and
this
enabled,
because
the
relief
that
the
respondent
wants
ultimately,
which
is
suspension
of
deportation,
is
relief
that
is
not
available
to
him
until
he's
been
in
the
country
for
seven
years,
what
he
got
was
managing
to
stay
in
this
country
until
the
seven-year
period
had
passed.
at
that
point
it
didn't
matter
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
he
then
had
the
opportunity
to
file
this
motion
to
reopen.
and
that's
exactly
the
point
here,
is
that
by
filing
appeals
that
had
absolutely
no
merit
he's
just
been
able
to
hold
up
the
system
long
enough
to
achieve
eligibility
for
relief.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
absolutely.
he
took
these
appeals
to
buy
time
and
he
succeeded
very
well.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
on
the
second
appeal,
the
court
said
that
the
attorney
general
was
not
allowed
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
these
appeals
were
taken
to
buy
time.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
i
think
the
board
could
take
that
position.
i
think
it
would
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
board
to
take
that
position.
in
fact,
however,
the
board
has
not
taken
that
position,
and
they
will
entertain
these
motions
to
reopen.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
yes,
even
though
part
of
the
time
was.
now--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--we'd
still
have
the
same
discretion.
that
would
be
a
closer
question.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
yes.
i
would
say,
getting
back
to
justice
rehnquist's
point,
i
think
the
board
could
say
that
the
time...
from
the
board's
perspective,
they
are
not
going
to
reopen
deportation
proceedings
just
because
further
time
has
now
run
after
the
deportation
proceedings
have
closed,
just
because
appeals
were
taken.
i
think
they
could
take
a
flat
rule.
they
have
not
done
that.
they
are
willing
to
consider
these
applications.
but
i
think,
given
that,
at
a
minimum,
at
a
minimum,
the
board
is
not
abusing
its
discretion
unless
the
appeals
have
been
taken
for
good
reason,
unless
a
case
like
you
posit,
where
the
appeal...
we
described
this
in
our
reply
brief...
where
it
would
be
reasonable
for
respondents
to
have
taken
an
appeal
quite
apart
from
the
delay
that
they
were
going
to
gain
from
it,
but
rather
to
take
the
appeal
on
their
own
merits.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
i
think
it's
hard
to...
i
find
it
hard
to
say
that
that
claim
was
not
frivolous.
it
was
frivolous.
it
had
been
rejected
by
several
courts,
including
the
eighth
circuit.
there
was
no
argument
made
in
any
of
the
briefs
suggesting
why
the
claim
had
any
merit,
no
case
citation,
nothing
suggesting
why
the
cases
were
wrong.
and
i
think
on
its
face,
although
it
is
true
that
one
district
court
had
once
accepted
this,
the
claim
is
really
quite
ridiculous,
because
it
means
that
anyone
could
come
into
this
country
and
all
they
have
to
do
is
run
and
have
a
baby
as
soon
as
they
can
and
then
they
can't
be
deported,
and
that's
clear.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
no,
that...
you're
right
about
that,
that
is
not
what
we
relied
on,
that
they
violated
the
immigration
laws
when
they
came
in.
that
is
true
of
everyone
who
applies
for
suspense,
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
that's
correct,
justice
marshall.
not
everyone
came
in
through
use
of
a
smuggler,
which
indicates
a
greater
degree
of
premeditation
and
flouting
of
the
government
immigration
laws.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
board--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--well,
i
think
the
board
is
entitled
to
draw
some
distinctions
between
a
person
who
maybe
works
in
a
field
near
the
u.s.
border
and
he
never
sees
any
border
patrol
agents
or
anything
and
figures,
well,
the
united
states
must
not
really
care
whether
i
go.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
no;
he
may
just
walk
across
because
he
sees
no
one
stopping
him.
i
think
the
more
important
factor
here,
though,
other
than
the
use
of
a
smuggler,
is
that
the
respondent
here
deceived
the
immigration
service
even
after
he
had
been
apprehended.
they
offered
him
administrative
voluntary
departure.
he
accepted
that.
he
asked
for
extensions
of
time
because
his
wife
is
pregnant,
and
then
when
they
finally
told
him
there
was
going
to
be
no
further
extensions
he
just
didn't
show
up
for
voluntary
departure.
and
in
fact
the
record
i
think
strongly
suggests
that
he
never
had
any
intention
of
voluntarily
departing.
in
fact,
at
the
immigration
judge's
hearing
where
the
judge
asked
him
whether
he
wanted
to
apply
for
voluntary
departure,
a
prerequisite
to
applying
is
stating
at
the
hearing
that
you
will
in
fact
depart
if
you're
granted
voluntary
departure.
and
if
you
look
at
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
you'll
see
that
it
took
several
minutes
for
the
immigration
judge
to
coax
this
statement
out
of
him,
because
he
said
several
times
that
he
was
not
going
to
leave
no
matter
what.
and
once
someone
is
caught
by
the
immigration
system,
i
think
the
attorney
general
is
entitled
to
take
into
account
whether
that
person
is
going
to
comply,
sort
of
play
by
the
rules
of
the
game
at
that
point,
i
mean,
here
is
someone
who
has
really
taken,
every
step
of
the
way
has
taken
whatever
steps
he
can,
even
if
it
includes
deceiving
the
immigration
authorities,
to
escape
deportation.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
the
statute
says
that
the
alien
has
to
meet
three
threshold
criteria:
seven
years
continuous
presence;
he
must
be
of
good
moral
character;
and
he
has
to
show
extreme
hardship.
once
he
meets
those
three
criteria,
at
that
point
the
attorney
general
then
has
discretion
to
decide
whether
he
should
stay
or
not.
some
of
the
thing
she
would
take
into
account
i
think
are
the
degree
of
the
hardship,
even
if
it
meets
the
extreme
hardship.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
the
court
has
described
it
as
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
the
statute
gives
the
alien
an
opportunity
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
it's
a
loose,
very
deferential
standard
of
review,
but
there
are...
for
example,
if
the
board
were
to
rely
on
some
factor
that
clearly
could
not
have
been
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
in
setting
up
the
remedy,
i
think
the
court
might
be
justified
in
finding
an
abuse
of
discretion,
if
they
said,
we're
going
to
grant
it
to
everybody
who's
name
starts
with
a,
but
nobody
whose
name
starts
with
j.--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--well,
no,
the
remedy
of
suspension
of
deportation
is
set
up
by
congress.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
i
agree,
i
agree.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
i
think
it
could
be
argued
that
it
is
totally
within
his
discretion.
but
it
has
been
found
that...
courts
have
found
that
they
have
jurisdiction
to
review
these.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
every
court
that
reviews
these
petitions.
i
don't
know
that
it's
really
been
litigated.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
the
court
spoke
of
unfettered
discretion
actually
in
connection
with
the
suspension
remedy,
and
i
understood
that
to
be
an
expression
of
very
broad
discretion,
but
not
necessarily
unreviewable
discretion,
because
the
suspension
remedy
is
clearly
subject
to
review.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
i
think
the
standard
of
review...
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
entitled
to
find
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
the
reasons--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--well,
the
court
said
unfettered
discretion
in
the
case
of
jay
versus
boyd,
but
the
court
went
on
in
that
case
to
decide
whether
the
attorney
general
had
in
fact
abused
his
discretion
there.
so
i
think
it
was
sort
of
implicit
in
the
court's
decision
that
there
is
some...
there
could
be
conceivable
circumstances
under
which
it
would
be
legitimate
to
find
abuse
of
discretion.
i
think
there
are
not
many.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
unfettered
discretion,
and
i
would
understand
the
court's
statement
to
that
effect
to
mean
that--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--the
courts
of
appeals
have
referred
to
it
that
way.
the
courts
of
appeals,
particularly
this
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit,
have
not
necessarily
applied
it
that
way,
and
that's
really
our
concern.
we
think
a
real
abuse...
the
government
could
certainly
live
with
a
real
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
we
make,
the
board
makes
these
decisions,
gives
reasons
for
these
decisions,
and
we
think
they're
legitimate
reasons,
as
long
as
courts
are
willing
to
defer--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--yes,
purely
on
the
basis
of
race,
or
even
if
it
was
made
for
some
completely
arbitrary
reason
that
was
placed
on
the
record,
and
it
could
be
not
conceivable
that
congress
contemplated
that
as
within
the
scope
of
the
discretion
it
was
conferring
on
the
attorney
general,
i
think
that
would
be
grounds.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
i
spoke
too
hastily
there,
i
think.
i
mean,
in
the
immigration
area
there
certainly
is
reason
to
draw
distinctions
on
the
basis
of
race.
but
i
think
it
would
be
subject
to--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--i
don't
think
that
is
our
position.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
the
attorney
general
is
willing
to
have
his
discretion
reviewed,
as
long
as
it
is
reviewed
on
the
basis
of
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
by
the
attorney
general?
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
that
it
would
be
arguable
at
least
that
congress
did
not...
that
that
was
contrary
to
the
will
of
congress.
congress
is
the
one
that
sets
up
quotas.
i'd
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
a
couple
points.
i
think
there's
a
little
bit
of
confusion
here
about
exactly
what's
been
held.
the
government
does
not
dispute,
the
board
did
not
dispute
in
its
remand,
that
the
seven
year
standard
has
been
satisfied.
it
doesn't
really
matter
whose
fault
the
delay
is,
because
this
is
not
like
a
speedy
trial
case,
where
parts
of
the
delay
are
being
excluded.
we
agree
that
they
met
the
seven
year
standard.
what
the
board
held
was
that,
because
the
standard
was
met
only
because
they
took
these
frivolous
appeals,
thereby
bringing
these
automatic
stay
provisions
into
effect,
the
board
in
its
discretion
was
not
going
to
exercise
its
discretion
favorably
towards
the
respondents
to
reopen
the
deportation
proceedings
that
had
already
been
closed.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
they
were
found
deportable
back
in
1978.
nothing
that
has
happened
in
this
case
since
then
has
suggested
that
that
determination
was
in
error
at
all.
with
hindsight,
it
is
clear
that
they
should
have
been
deported
in
december
of
1978.
the
respondents
have
already
gotten...
even
at
the
time
that
the
board
ruled,
they
had
gotten
three
and
a
half
years
of
an
additional
windfall
of
being
in
this
country,
just
because
they
filed
these
appeals
and
invoked
the
stay.
what
the
board
has
said
that,
in
addition
to
that
windfall,
we're
not
also
going
to
let
you
achieve
eligibility
for
relief
that
would
let
you
stay
in
this
country
permanently
just
because
you
filed
these
appeals.
if
they
do
that,
it's
going
to
create
a
tremendous
incentive
for
everybody
to
file
whatever
kind
of
papers
they
can
to
delay
things
until
they
meet
the
statutory
requirements.
if
the
board
takes
the
position
that
it
did
take
here,
then
at
least
a
person
knows
that
by
taking
these
sorts
of
dilatory
tactics
he's
not
going
to
put
himself
in
a
position
to
create
new
equities
that
is
going
to
give
him
relief
to
which
he
was
not
entitled.
and
one
more
point
about
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
about
the
appeals
not
being
frivolous.
i
just
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
what
the
board
said
about
the
merit
of
the
appeals.
they
said
the
appeals
were
not
frivolous.
the
only
reason
they
gave
is
that
they
had
enabled
the
respondents
to
get
relief,
that
is,
that
they
enabled
them
to
gum
up
the
works
for
long
enough
that
the
seven
years
passed.
that's
not...
in
our
judgment,
that
is
not
something
that--
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
--makes
them
not
frivolous.
and
the
board
in
fact...
i'm
sorry.
the
court
of
appeals,
if
it
didn't
think
the
appeals
were
frivolous,
it
should
have
ruled
on
them,
because
what
they
were
asking
for
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
relief
from
deportation,
not
this
discretionary
relief.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
reviewable
under
a
standard
of
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
guess
i
don't
want
to
go
on
a
limb
with
that.
i
don't
recall
that
the
standard
there
was
very
different.
let
me
just
say
one
more
thing.
this
was
really
not
a
procedural
decision
by
the
eighth
circuit.
they
didn't
complain
that
the
board
didn't
give
its
reasons
good
enough.
they
didn't
send
this
case
back
to
the
board
for
a
foolish
statement
of
reasons,
as
to
what
the
reason
was
for
the
board's
decision.
they
sent
it
back
to
hold
a
hearing
and
basically
to
grant
the
suspension
relief.
mr.
alan
ira
horowitz
well,
we've
never
taken
that
position.
i
think
if
the
board
gave
as
a
statement
of
reasons
something
that
the
court
could
in
good
conscience
say
was
something
that
was
not
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
and
really
contrary
to
the
will
of
congress,
that--
