justice
jr.
now
is
that
the
'82,
the
one
that
resulted
in
the
'82
decision,
mr.
horowitz?
justice
jr.
i
notice
your
brief
doesn't
say
much
about
that
'82
decision.
isn't
that
relevant
to
this
thing
we
have
to
decide?
justice
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
as
i
read
their
later
opinion
what
they
said
is
that
the
law
of
the
case
was
the
'82
decision.
they
did
order,
in
effect
they
did
order
reopening,
didn't
they,
in
'82?
justice
jr.
and
the
government...
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
jr.
but
the
government
never
appealed
the
'82
decision,
did
it?
justice
jr.
do
i
understand
what
you
said,
mr.
horowitz,
that
the
government
has
no
quarrel
at
all
with
the
1982
decision?
justice
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
the
eighth
circuit
ordered
the
board
to
do
something,
if
the
board
were
to
do
it,
it
would
do
it
merely
out
of
deference
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
not
because
it
was
required
to
comply
with
any
direction
of
the
eighth
circuit?
justice
jr.
i
see.
that's
what
i
thought
you
answered
justice
stevens.
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
horowitz,
what
do
you
think
the
respondent
won
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
first
go-around
in
that
court?
justice
jr.
something
he
did
not
have
without
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
did
he?
justice
jr.
what
did
your
client
get
out
of
the
first
go-around?
justice
jr.
that
was
all?
justice
jr.
well,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
mean
by
law
of
the
case?
justice
jr.
well,
are
you
arguing
that
the
second
gave
them
nothing
that
the
first
hadn't
already
given?
