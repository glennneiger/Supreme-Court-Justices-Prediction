mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
initially
focus
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
actually
decided,
rather
than--
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
--in
the
second
decision,
the
decision
that's
the
subject
of
this
petition.
i'd
like
to
focus
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
actually
decided,
rather
than
the
government's
characterization
of
it.
the
court
of
appeals
never
held
that
the
government
could
not
consider,
that
ins
could
not
consider,
that
the
board
could
not
deny
motions
to
reopen
where
the
seven
years
of
continuous
physical
presence
were
obtained
by
frivolous
appeals.
to
the
contrary,
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
considered
decisions
from
the
ninth
circuit
which
had
basically
said
there
could
not
be
discretionary
denials
where
the
three
threshold
requirements
had
been
met
and
it
rejected
that.
it
said,
we
assume
that
the
board
has
this
power,
but
we
reverse
the
board
here
because
the
decision
isn't
rational
because
the
petitions
and
appeals
were
not
themselves
frivolous.
that's
what
the
court
held.
as
to
the
disregard
of
the
immigration
laws,
they
said
disregard
of
the
immigration
laws
might
well
be
a
factor
to
be
considered
by
the
board,
but
the
board
hasn't
explained
why
the
disregard
in
this
case
is
any
different
from
any
other
deportable
alien.
the
remedy
of
suspension
of
deportation
only
applies
to
deportable
aliens.
it's
a
statutory
prerequisite,
so
we
can't
find
them
not
entitled
because
they're
deportable.
the
board
didn't
explain
why
anything
that
these
aliens
had
done--
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
--they
said
that
they
considered...
in
their
summary
of
what
they
considered,
in
addition
to
the
frivolous
appeals...
and
it
did
say
"in
addition
to"...
that
they
had
used
a
paid
smuggler
and
had
failed
to
depart
voluntarily.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
no,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
that
the
board
hasn't
explained
why
these
facts
are
a
peculiar
problem
under
the
immigration
laws.
the
board
hasn't
used
its
expertise
to
explain
to
us.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
the
derivation
of
the
term
1956
decision
of
this
court
in
jay
versus
boyd.
on
the
previous...
that's
on
page
354.
on
page
353
of
that
decision,
the
court
talks
about
the
sound
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
and
since
jay
this
court
has
of
course
decided
ins
versus
wang.
in
ins
versus
wang,
footnote
5
talks
about
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
and
it
doesn't
talk
about
the
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
the
language...
that's
footnote
6
in
phinpathya,
which
of
course
you
wrote.
if
it
were
entirely
within
the
discretion,
then
there'd
be
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court
because
there'd
be
no
purpose
to
have
jurisdiction.
but
congress
has
provided
for
jurisdiction,
and
this
court
in
jehovah
versus
rosenberg
in
1964
found
that
there
was
jurisdiction
by
petition
for
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals
to
review
motions
to
reopen
to
assert
a
suspension
of
deportation
claim.
so
there
is
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was...
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
applying
was
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard,
and
saying
there's
a
range
of
decisions
that
we
might
disagree
with,
that
we
have
to
uphold,
we
must
affirm,
because
you
are
the
primary
enforcer
of
the
immigration
laws;
but
we
as
a
court
of
appeals
have
a
duty
to
make
you
make
those
decisions
in
a
rational
way.
you
have
to
explain
why
you
treat
a
differently
from
b,
and
that
has
been
the
thrust
of
the
post-wang
court
of
appeals
decisions.
in
ramos
versus
ins,
which
is
a
fifth
circuit
case
cited
in
both
briefs...
that's
the
thrust
of
virtually
all
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
since
wang.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
board
did
anything
wrong.
i
don't
think
they're
reversing
that
presumption.
i
think
they're
saying:
board,
you
just
have
to
give
us
some
rational
reasons;
these
reasons
don't
make
any
sense
to
us.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
i
think
it's
more
a
matter
of
what
they
were
imposing
was
a
matter
of
administrative
fairness.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
i
think
it's
what
congress
intended.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
congress
provided
for
suspension
remedy,
and
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
is
that
congress
intended
that
remedy
be
evenhandedly
administered.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
the
board's
been
provided...
well,
the
motion
process
is
provided
by
the
attorney
general.
it's
interesting
that
if
you
look
at
the
regulations,
the
old
regulation,
the
predecessor
to
the
current
one,
8
cfr
3.2,
used
to
say
that
the
decision
was
solely
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
the
present
regulation
doesn't
say
that.
it's
framed
in
the
negative.
and
this
court
in
wang
says
because
it's
framed
in
the
negative
that
gives
the
attorney
general
broad
discretion,
but
not
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
jay
is
inconsistent
in
its
usage.
it
also
uses
the
term
"sound
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
"
and
that
would
imply
certainly
that
it
was
reviewable
as
to
unsoundness,
irrationality,
arbitrariness.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
in
the
section
244
in
the
act
itself,
it
says
"in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
"
it
doesn't
say
"sound".
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
that's
correct.
as
to
the
question
from
mr.
justice
stevens
as
to
delays,
a
lot
of
the
delays
in
this
case
can
be
laid
at
the
feet
of
the
immigration
service
and
not
at
the
feet
of
the
alien.
just
to
note
that
the
appeal
was
taken
in
december
of
1978
and
there
wasn't
any
decision
from
the
board
until
may
of
1980.
that's
not
time
chargeable
to
the
alien.
he
didn't
do
anything
to
bring
that
about.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
i
don't
know
why.
i
know
the
government
moved
to
dismiss.
they
moved
to
vacate
the
stay
and
dismiss
the
appeal,
from
the
docket
entries,
and
i
know
that
that
was
denied
by
the
eighth
circuit,
and
then
they
then
scheduled
the
case
for
argument,
and
it
was
argued
and
decided.
i
can't
know
why
it
took
the
eighth
circuit
that
long
to
decide.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
the
practice
of
the
eighth
circuit,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
he
got
a
chance
to
apply
for
suspension.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
well,
it's
possible,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
read
their
previous
opinion
the
second
time
around
as
mandating
that
the
motion
to
reopen
be
granted.
it
is...
frankly,
i
must
say
i
find
the
first
decision
equivocal.
there
are
parts
of
it--
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
--i
think
they
felt
that,
when
they
considered
it
the
second
time,
that
the
first
time
they
had
ordered
the
board
to
reopen
and
that
the
board
wasn't
free
to
deny
the
motion.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
oh,
no.
i
think
the...
our
position
is
not
that
the
first...
we
don't
adopt
the
law
of
the
case
argument.
i
just
cannot
read
the...
in
fairness
to
the
government,
i
don't
think
that
the
first
opinion
is
unequivocal.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
perfectly
ambiguous.
what
the
second
opinion
gave,
the
second
opinion
orders
the
board
to
grant
the
motion
to
reopen.
the
first
opinion
arguably
did.
the
court
felt
that
it
had.
it's
arguable,
but
it's
not...
it
wasn't
well
established.
now,
the
attorney
general
clearly
continues
to
have
the
discretion
to...
i
use
the
word...
sanction,
to
pretermit
or
to
cut
off
applications
for
suspension
of
deportation
where
the
seven
years
have
been
improperly
gained.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
they
couldn't
do
that.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is:
you
said
it
was
frivolous;
we've
taken
a
look
at
it
and
most
of
what,
the
conduct
that
was
alleged
to
be
frivolous,
took
place
in
front
of
us,
and
we
have
looked
at
it
and
we
have
determined
that
it's
not
frivolous.
they're
not
saying
that
the
attorney
general
can't
utilize
that
authority.
they're
just
saying
that
in
this
particular
case,
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
as
applied
to
the
law
of
this
case,
that
it's
not
frivolous.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
i
think
some
deference
is
due
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
since
the
activity
talked
about
took
place
in
front
of
them.
i
wouldn't
say
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
i
think
that
would
be
an
overbroad
argument.
i
think
some
deference
is
due,
since
it
did
take
place
in
front
of
them.
not
as
much
deference
as
due
to
the
attorney
general
by
the
court
of
appeals.
as
to
the...
i
want
to
stress
again
on
the
issue
of
disregard,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
the
board
couldn't
apply
that
rule,
but
that,
as
we've
gone
into,
that
they
only
had
to
apply
it
in
a
manner
that
made
sense,
that
was
rational,
that
wasn't
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
have
nothing
else,
unless
there
are
other
questions.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
i
think
that's
what
we're
arguing,
is
there's
been
an
evolution
in
the
practice
of
administrative
law
and
there
has
been
an
evolution
in
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
yes,
i
think
essentially--
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
--we're
not
arguing
that
that
class
of
behavior
can't
be
sanctioned.
we're
not
saying
that
the
attorney
general
can't
deny
motions
to
reopen
where
frivolous
appeals
have
gained
the
seven
years.
all
the
court
of
appeals
held
here,
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said...
all
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
this
appeal,
these
appeals
weren't
frivolous.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
i
think
in
terms
of
expertise,
this
isn't
something
that
the
agency
was
set
up
to
decide.
they're
no
set
up
to
decide
what
are
frivolous
appeals.
that's
more
of
a
judgment
that
courts
make.
i
think
less
deference
is
due
a
decider,
an
administrative
agency,
when
they
decide
something
that's
not
within
their
expertise
than
something
that's
within.
when
the
board
makes
a
decision
as
to
what
category
of
conduct
raises
peculiar
problems
under
the
immigration
laws,
that's
where
deference
should
be
high.
that's
what
they're
set
up
to
do.
they're
set
up
to
be
experts.
but
where
they
say
a
petition
for
review
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
frivolous,
that's
not
something
within
their
expertise.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
h.
rudnick
--could
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
yes,
or
the
length
of
your
name
or
something
like
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
