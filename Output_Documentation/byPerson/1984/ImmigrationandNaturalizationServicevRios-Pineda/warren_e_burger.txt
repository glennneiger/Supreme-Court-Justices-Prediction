mr.
horowitz,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
i
suppose
the
attorney
general
should
be
free
to
think
it
was
wholly
unnecessary
for
them
to
do
what
they
did
in
1982,
but
out
of
deference
to
the
judicial
branch
he
complied
with
it
rather
than
appealing.
chief
justice
burger
well,
they
have
only
two
choices:
either
to
comply
with
it
or
petition
for
cert.
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
short
answer
is
that
what
he
got
out
of
it
was
time,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
does
the
board--
--explaining
it
in
those
terms,
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
simply
not
liked
the
way
the
attorney
general
exercised
his
discretion.
chief
justice
burger
are
you
saying
that
even
if
the
standard
is
unfettered
discretion,
there
can
be
an
abuse
of
discretion?
chief
justice
burger
courts
of
appeals
have
generally
referred
to
it
as
discretion
with
a
wide
latitude
and
terms
of
that
kind,
have
they
not?

justice

burger
mr.
rudnick.
chief
justice
burger
which
time?
which
time,
the
first
or
the
second?
chief
justice
burger
did
congress
say
"sound
discretion"?
chief
justice
burger
they
didn't
modify
it
with
any
adjectives,
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anything
further,
mr.
horowitz?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
