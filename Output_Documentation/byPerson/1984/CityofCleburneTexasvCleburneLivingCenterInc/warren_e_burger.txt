we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
city
of
cleburne,
texas,
against
cleburne
living
center.
mr.
luna,
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
burger
well,
would
they
allow
a
boarding
house
for
14
people
in
a--
chief
justice
burger
--in
this
kind
of
a
space?
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
one
of
the
factors
that
in
an
emergency
such
as
a
fire
they
might
not
respond
the
same
as
a
family
under
the
supervision
of
a
mother
and
a
father
over
children,
or
they
might
not
be
able
to
cope
the
way
13
or
14
boarders
could
cope?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hicks.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
agree
that
a
householder
who
had
that
place
could
run
a
boarding
house
with
13
or
14
people,
with
those
rooms
and
two
bathrooms?
chief
justice
burger
three
bathrooms.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
the
legislative
arm
has
a
right
to
distinguish
between
13
retarded
children
and
their
capacity
to
cope
with
emergencies
such
as
fire
and
so
forth,
and
either
an
ordinary
traditional
family
or
adult
boarders?
chief
justice
burger
well,
isn't
that
the
question
here?
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
have
just
told
me
that
they
could
have
an
adult
group
there.
chief
justice
burger
my
question
is,
is
there
a
distinction
between
an
adult
group
and
their
capacity
to
cope
with
emergencies
and
the
problems
of
living
together
in
those
quarters
or
in
a
bedroom
and
children
who
are
retarded?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
see
if
i
have
got
your
response
correctly.
these
retarded
people
would
be
better
able
to
cope
than
the
general
run
of
13
or
14
boarders
that
they
may
have
in
the
house?
chief
justice
burger
wouldn't
you
think
that
they
are
entitled
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
ability
of
people
to
cope
on
that
basis,
that
is,
if
you
have
got
former
felons
who
are
not
retarded,
and
whatever
the
other
group
was,
not
retarded,
that
they
could
cope
better
than
retarded
people?
chief
justice
burger
i
am
not
stating
that
as
a
fact.
chief
justice
burger
i
am
simply
stating,
are
they
entitled
as
the
legislative
arm
to
decide
on
that
basis?
chief
justice
burger
you
say
that
is
not
rational?
chief
justice
burger
well,
aren't
they
in
that
home
and
that
environment
precisely
because
someone
has
determined
medically
or
psychologically
that
they
are
not
capable
of
coping
as
normal
people
are,
as
capable?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
why
are
they
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
luna?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
