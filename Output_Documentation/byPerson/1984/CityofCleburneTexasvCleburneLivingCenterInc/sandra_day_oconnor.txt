justice
o'connor
may
i
inquire?
i
don't
quite
understand
what
you
just
referred
to.
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
of
texas
requires
the
city
to
use
special
use
permits
for
homes
for
retarded
people?
justice
o'connor
i
had
understood
the
position
of
the
state
of
texas
in
its
brief
to
be
that
the
city
was
not
authorized
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
base
its
zoning
decisions
on
the
physical
adequacy
of
the
site
or
of
a
given
structure
as
a
group
home.
do
you
agree
with
the
position
taken
by
the
state
of
texas
here?
justice
o'connor
and
it
is
your
position
that
their
brief
is
in
error
then?
justice
o'connor
and
where
in
the
joint
appendix
would
we
find
what
you
are
referring
to,
if
you
know
offhand?
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
take
time
from
your
argument.
justice
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
o'connor
mr.
luna,
if
the
property
were...
if
the
use
of
the
property
was
proposed
as
a
boarding
house
for
people,
i
take
it
no
special
use
permit
would
have
been
required.
justice
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
in
any
event
the
same
requirement
would
not
have
been
made
had
it
been
a
boarding
house
or
adults
who
were
not
mentally
retarded.
justice
o'connor
mr.
luna,
is
there
any
place
in
the
city
of
cleburne
where
a
group
home
may
be
established
without
a
special
use
permit
for
retarded
people?
justice
o'connor
well,
would
you
answer
my
question?
is
there
any
place
within
the
city
where
a
group
home
for
the
retarded
can
be
established
without
a
special
use
permit?
justice
o'connor
okay,
and
are
there
any
standards
at
all
for
the
yearly
renewal
of
such
permits
if
they
are
obtained?
justice
o'connor
and
the
ordinance
for
the
special
use
permit
requires
getting
signatures
of
neighbors,
is
that
right,
in
order
to
issue
a...
in
order
to
issue
a
special
use
permit,
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
applicant
obtain
signatures
of
neighboring
property
owners?
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
i
saw
that.
i
wondered
if
you
could
enlighten
me
as
to
whether
those
signatures
involved
getting
the
consent
of
the
neighbors
or
just
a
name
on
a
paper.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
hicks,
was
the
argument
about
the
policy
and
laws
of
the
state
of
texas
fully
developed
in
the
courts
below?
justice
o'connor
it
seemed
to
me
that
was
a
new
factor.
justice
o'connor
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
in
the
courts
below,
the
argument
was
made
by
the
city
that
we
are
just
doing
this
as
a
means
of
helping
the
retarded
to
be
sure
they
have
proper
facilities,
and
now
the
state
of
texas
is
coming
in
and
saying
that
is
not
the
city's
business,
it
is
our
business,
and
we
have
regulated
it,
and
they
have
no
right
to.
and
i
just
wondered
the
extent
to
which
that
had
been
developed
below.
justice
o'connor
so
there
might
be
some
purpose
in
a
remand
on
rational
basis
inquiry
in
the
event
the
court
disagrees
with
the
heightened
scrutiny
standard.
justice
o'connor
except
that
the
district
court,
of
course,
found
that
it
met
the
rational
basis
inquiry.
justice
o'connor
well,
and
perhaps
the
district
court
is
in
a
better
position
to
be
familiar
with
texas
law
than
this
court.
justice
o'connor
mr.
hicks,
in
your
view,
are
all
laws
that
distinguish
between
the
mentally
retarded
and
other
groups
suspect,
or
just
those
that
segregate
them
from
the
general
population?
are
laws
that
provide
special
education
opportunities
and
things
like
that
in
your
view
subject
to
heightened
scrutiny?
justice
o'connor
perhaps
not
invalidation,
but
at
least
heightened
scrutiny.
justice
o'connor
are
there
other
groups
that
in
your
view
likewise
merit
heightened
scrutiny
which
haven't
been
given
it
in
the
past,
such
as
the
mentally
ill
or
people
who
are
homosexuals
or
other
particularized
groups?
justice
o'connor
and
why
is
that?
i
mean,
what
are
the--
justice
o'connor
--does
any
jurisdiction
today
to
your
knowledge
deprive
mentally
retarded
adults
of
their
vote?
justice
o'connor
is
there
any
restriction
in
texas
today
on
the
right
of
the
retarded
adult
to
vote?
