justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
it
was
in
a
500-year
flood
plane,
does
that
mean
that
you
would
expect
a
flood
every
500
years?
justice
rehnquist
and
did
the
city
have
a
general
policy
against
building
within
that
flood
plane?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
luna,
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
you
presented
two
questions.
one
is
whether
mentally
retarded
persons
are
a
quasi-suspect
class
for
purposes
of
equal
protection
analysis.
the
second
is
whether
for
equal
protection
analysis
legislation
affecting
mentally
retarded
people
must
be
tested
by
an
intermediate
or
heightened
level
of
scrutiny.
so,
i
would
presume
that
you
intend
to
argue
some
time
not
just
as
to
whether
you
should
win
this
particular
case
under
the
constitution,
but
what
standard
it
should
be
judged
by.
justice
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
has
no
power
at
all
to
disenfranchise
anyone
who
is
mentally
retarded?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
extreme
retardation
would
be
a
basis
then
for
disenfranchising,
a
permissible
one.
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference,
really,
when
you
are
focusing
on
that
particular
question,
and
you
say
the
severely
mentally
retarded
would
be...
could
properly
be
disenfranchised
because
they
didn't
understand
the
workings
of
democracy.
isn't
that
a
consequence
of
their
severe
mental
retardation?
