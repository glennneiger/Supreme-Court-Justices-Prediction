mr.
renea
hicks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case,
in
which
cleburne
has
classified
a
group
home
for
mentally
retarded
people
as
a
hospital
for
the
feebleminded,
is
a
crucial
one
for
retarded
people,
involving
what
the
trial
court
found
as
a
fact
is
the
current
principal
means
of
their
gaining
access
to
living
in
this
nation's
communities.
this
case
will
establish
the
constitutional
boundaries
of
what
a
city
may
do
through
its
zoning
ordinance
to
impede
retarded
persons'
efforts
to
become
socially
useful
citizens
in
this
nation's
cities.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
first,
there
are
three
bathrooms.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
ordinance,
it
is
clear
from
the
trial
judge's
fact
findings
as
agreed
to
by
the
fifth
circuit
that
if
everything
else
about
the
house
was
the
same,
then
any
other
group
of
13
people
could
locate
there,
whether
they
be
a
large
traditional
family,
whether
it
be
a
nursing
home
that
also
might
be
certified
under
state
licensing
laws
and
the
medicaid
program--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
that
would
be
a
closer
question
than
this
one
is,
i
believe,
but
that
isn't
what--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
the
people
that
would
be
living
here
would
be
adults
that
are
retarded,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
a
basis.
in
fact,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
is
quite
likely
that
in
the
event
of
an
emergency,
if
this
were
a
group
home
for
mentally
retarded
people
located
here
as
opposed
to
a
normal
boarding
house
without
being
specially
set
up
for
retarded
people,
that
the
ability
of
the
people
in
the
group
home
for
mentally
retarded
people
to
evacuate
in
case
of
an
emergency
would
be
superior
to
the
ability
of
boarders.
and
one
reason
for
that
is
because
there
is
special
training
done
in
that
very
area.
besides
that,
i
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind--
mr.
renea
hicks
i
think
it
is
quite
likely
that
they
would,
your
honor.
once
again,
the
very
purpose
of
this
group
home
is
to
teach
them
independent
living
skills,
and
one
aspect
of
that,
as
required
under
the
state
program
that
is
administered,
is
that
there
be
special
training
for
emergencies.
most
people,
and
i
think
this
has
happened
many
times
in
boarding
houses,
in
fires,
people
panic,
in
general.
anybody
panics.
and
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
distinction
drawn
in
the
zoning
ordinance
is
not
just
between
group
homes
for
mentally
retarded
people
and
the
boarding
house.
it
is
between
group
homes
for
mentally
retarded
people
and,
for
instance,
a
nursing
home,
or
a
halfway
house
for
juvenile
delinquents,
and
at
one
time
one
of
the
city
administrators
said
a
halfway
house
for
paroled
felons
would
be
permissible
here.
so,
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
distinction
that
has
been
drawn.
mr.
renea
hicks
--your
honor,
i
just
don't
accept
the
proposition
that
the
mentally--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
understand.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
i
think
at
a
minimum
there
has
to
be
a
rational
basis
for
that
decision.
mr.
renea
hicks
and
i
don't
think
that
this
decision
that
the
city
council
engaged
in
had
a
rational
basis.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
a
conclusion
that
mentally
retarded
people
would
be
less
able
to
take
certain
actions
than
other
people
in
this
instance.
in
fact,
again,
i
submit
there
would
be
special
programs
set
up
that
i
suspect
would
ensure
that
they
would
react
in
a
better
way.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
that,
i
think,
overstates
the
determination
that
is
made.
mr.
renea
hicks
they
are
there
in
many
instances
because
they
do
learn
slower,
is
the
shorthand
version
of
what
mental
retardation
is,
and
they
need
an
opportunity
in
a
structured
environment
to
do
their
learning,
to
learn,
for
instance,
household
cleaning
chores
and
the
importance
of
following
through
on
those
things,
cooking
skills.
this
is,
as
the
name
implies,
an
intermediate
facility,
and
most
people
it
is
hoped
will
move
on
to
even
more
independent
living
in
these
situations.
i
believe
that
it
overstates
the
disability
of
mental
retardation
to
say
that
they
are
unable
to
cope
with
everything
in
daily
living,
and
that
they
are
unable
to
learn
how
to
better
cope
in
some
instances
with
certain
details
of
daily
living.
i
think
that
the
city's
actions
in
this
particular
case
and
its
justifications
for
its
actions
are
a
crystallization
for
the
court
of
the
historical
attitudes
and
mistreatment
and
underestimation
of
mentally
retarded
people
and
their
abilities.
the
city
has
offered
two
general
justifications
for
the
distinction
drawn
in
the
zoning
ordinance.
one
is
that
it
is
to
protect
the
neighbors,
in
essence
to
protect
society
from
the
mentally
retarded
people.
the
other
is
that
it
is
to
protect
retarded
people
themselves.
this
is
a
classic
example
of
government's
historical
justifications
for
exclusion
of
mentally
retarded
people
from
many
areas
of
american
life.
on
the
one
hand,
it
is
argued
we
are
here
to
protect
society.
we
exclude
them
to
protect
society.
then,
as
an
afterthought,
the
argument
is
made,
well,
it
is
really
also
intended
to
protect
the
mentally
retarded
people.
it
is
to
do
them
some
good.
i
don't
think
the
record
in
this
case
supports
either
one
of
those
justifications.
as
to
protecting--
mr.
renea
hicks
--yes.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
well,
i
am
attempting
to
go
through
what
their
reasons
are.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
obviously
a
judgment
for
the
court
to
make,
but
i
think
it
would
be
an
inefficient
use
of
resources.
the
rational
basis
test
was
argued
before
the
fifth
circuit.
they
went
on
to
decide
the
quasi-suspect
question.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
whole
record
is
before
this
court.
it
has
been
fully
developed,
and
i
think
the
court
in--
mr.
renea
hicks
--the
one--
mr.
renea
hicks
--the
state
of
texas
did
not
submit
an
amicus
brief
at
the
fifth
circuit
level,
making
the
arguments
it
made
in
its
amicus
brief.
mr.
renea
hicks
the
last
part
of
the
argument
was
not
developed.
i
might
also
add
that
the
argument
that
this
was
to
protect
the
mentally
retarded
people
argument
by
the
city
was
not
developed
very
much
at
that
point.
it
only
has
arrived
at
that
conclusion
as
its
primary
justification
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
your
honor,
again,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate.
neither
party
has
asked
for
that
at
any
rate.
i
realize
it
is
a
judgment
for
the
court
to
make,
obviously.
i
don't
think
that
the
argument
that
the
state
has
made
that
was
not
developed
below
is
crucial
to
this
court's
making
a
decision
on
even
the
rational
basis
standard
of
analysis.
mr.
renea
hicks
right,
but
it
didn't
address
the
particular
aspect
of
the
argument
that
texas
has
made.
it
didn't
use
that
for
finding
that
there
was
a
rational
basis.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
your
honor,
perhaps.
i
just
think
that
the
rational
basis
aspect
of
the
case,
to
the
extent
the
court
takes
that
approach,
still
can
be
decided
by
this
court.
i
think
the
record
is
fully
enough
developed.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
an
appropriate
standard
for
this
court
to
use--
mr.
renea
hicks
--that
is
all
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate
as
an
alternative
only
that
this
court
decide
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
the
decision.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
your
honor,
again...
you
mean
to
reach
the
rational
basis
matter?
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
i
think...
i
would
like
to
win
the
case.
0
[generallaughter.]
turning
to
the
question
of
whether
heightened
scrutiny
is
appropriate
for
discrimination
against
mentally
retarded
people,
i
think
that
the
class
of
mentally
retarded
people
perhaps
more
than
any
other
group
of
americans
except
racial
minorities
fit
the
criteria
that
this
court
has
established
for
what
constitutes
a
class
that
calls
for
heightened
scrutiny
when
discriminations
are
made
against
it.
mr.
renea
hicks
your
honor,
we
did
urge
strict
scrutiny
before
the
fifth
circuit.
they
rejected
it.
again,
i
think
that
the
standards
that
this
court
has
set,
if
applied
here,
would
mean
that
strict
scrutiny
is
appropriate.
but
once
again,
trying
to
narrow
the
decision
as
much
as
is
necessary,
i
think
a
heightened
scrutiny
at
what
has
been
termed
the
quasi-suspect
level
of
scrutiny
would
be
appropriate
and
would
result
in
the
invalidation
of
the
city's
actions
in
this
instance.
mentally
retarded
people
are
a
quintessential,
discrete,
and
insular
minority.
i
don't
think
anyone
has
argued
to
the
contrary
on
that
particular
point.
they
have
suffered
from
a
history
of
mistreatment
that
is
virtually
unequaled
in
this
nation's
history
except
for
racial
minorities.
they
have
been
subjected
to
eugenic
sterilization
laws
based
on
what
has
turned
out
to
be
misinformed
scientific
doctrines.
they
have
been
isolated,
as
the
trial
court
found
as
a
fact
in
remote,
stigmatizing
living
arrangements.
and
i
think
that
there
has
been
much
litigation
that
has
come
before
this
court
that
delineates
the
problems
in
these
large
institutions
that
the
court
was
referring
to,
and
i
think
no
one
questions
but
that
they
are
stigmatizing.
i
think
that
the
result
of
that
is
that
because
they
have
been
isolated
in
these
institutions,
no
one
in
society
or
few
people
in
society
understand
what
mental
retardation
is.
they
can
only
operate
on
stereotypes
because
they
don't
see
on
a
daily
basis
mentally
retarded
people
interacting
at
the
stores--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
a
law
that
is
intended
to
address
the
special
needs
of
mentally
retarded
people
and
past
inequities
necessarily
needs
to
be
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny.
this
court
has
said
before
in
a
case
such
as
fullilove
versus
klutznick
that
when
remedying
past
discriminations
is
what
is
at
stake,
then
there
is
a
different
standard
to
be
applied,
or
alternatively
i
might
add
that
applying
the
heightened
scrutiny
to
those
laws
will
not
subject
those
laws
to
invalidation.
i
think
it
would
be
very
supportable.
and
i
think
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
substantial
relation
between
any
discriminations,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
drawn
in,
say,
the
special
education
act,
that
there
is
a
substantial
relationship
between
that
and
an
important
governmental
interest
of
providing
an
appropriate
education
program
for
mentally
retarded
people.
i
think
that
there
are
many
fewer
laws
that
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
mental
retardation
than
might
at
first
blush
appear.
quite
often
people
think
that
guardianship
laws,
sterilization
laws,
commitment
laws
all
necessarily
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
mental
retardation.
while
some
do,
the
more
modern
statutes
clearly
do
not.
they
address
neutral
criteria
and
neutral
traits
that
are
not
tied
to
mental
retardation
in
and
of
itself.
they
recognize
what
the
city
here
did
not
recognize,
and
that
is
that
there
are
individual
differences
within
the
group
of
people
who
are
mentally
retarded.
some
have
more
abilities
than
others.
it
may
very
well
turn
out
that
some
require
commitment,
but
it
is
not
because
of
their
mental
retardation
that
they
require
commitment.
it
is
because
of
other
aspects
that
happen
to
fall
in
with
the
fact
that
they
are
mentally
retarded.
so,
i
think
it
is
overstating
matters
to
think
that
a
whole
host
of
statutes
would
be
subject
to
invalidation
under
this
approach.
furthermore--
mr.
renea
hicks
--again,
i
think
there
is
a
much
smaller
universe
of
statutes
that
fit
that,
and
my
next
point
was
going
to
be
that
invalidation
does
not
necessarily
follow
from
applying
heightened
scrutiny.
this
court
has,
in
other
instances
where
heightened
scrutiny
has
been
applied,
upheld
classifications
based
on
gender,
based
on
illegitimacy.
and
it
has
shown
itself
capable
of
discerning
when
important
interests
are
at
stake
and
when
there
is
a
substantial
relationship
between
the
objective
and
the
classification
drawn
in
the
statute.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
i
am
not
an
expert
at
all
in
either
of
those
other
areas...
or
in
the
other
areas.
i
haven't
canvassed
all
of
them.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
another
group
of
people
in
this
society
that
so
warrant
treatment
as
a
quasi-suspect
or
suspect
classification,
heightened
scrutiny,
as
the
group
of
mentally
retarded
people.
for
instance,
i--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
for
instance,
with
people
that
are
mentally
ill,
for
instance,
i
think
there
is
a
potential
difference
between
the
immutability
of
the
characteristic.
people
move
in
and
out
of
mental
illness.
not
everyone
does,
but
people
do.
and
those
that
are
mentally
ill
at
one
time
quite
often
are
capable
of
having
political
power.
they
vote.
they
haven't
been
excluded
from
the
vote
as
universally
as
mentally
retarded
people,
for
instance.
when
they
aren't
classified
as
mentally
ill,
they
clearly
can
vote,
and
they
can
have
an
impact
on
their
community.
the
onset
of
it
quite
often
is
later
in
life.
as
to
homosexuality,
i
think
once
again
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
whether
that
trait
is
an
immutable
characteristic,
and
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
that
group
of
people
exerts
considerable
political
power
in
some
areas
of
this
country.
so,
i
think
they
are
much
different
and
are
much...
again,
i
haven't
thought
of
what
the
ultimate
resolution
should
be,
but
they
are
clearly
not
as
close
a
fit
to
the
standards
this
court
has
set--
mr.
renea
hicks
--yes,
your
honor.
you
mean
as
of
today?
i
haven't
canvassed
the
statutes
in
detail.
as
of
1979,
the
majority
of
states
disenfranchised
mentally
retarded
people.
i
would
note...
this
came
up
during
the
appellate
argument
at
the
circuit
level
on
this...
that
it
required
a
texas
secretary
of
state's
opinion
to
get
the
person
a
right
to
vote
that
was
mentally
retarded.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
they
classify
mentally
retarded
people,
i
believe...
the
constitution
says
that
idiots
may
be
denied
the
right
to
vote.
now,
"idiots"
is
an
outmoded
term.
it
is
another
example
of
how
mentally
retarded
people
have
been
stigmatized.
and
it
has
been
applied
at
local
levels
by
elections
officers
to
mean
somebody
with
down's
syndrome,
for
instance,
who
is
quite
capable
of
voting,
couldn't
vote.
and
again,
that
happened
in
1982
in
the
southern
part
of
texas.
somebody
that
had
down's
syndrome
was
denied
the
right
to
vote
merely
because
of
that.
and
it
took
an
opinion
after
the
fact,
after
he
had
missed
the
opportunity
to
vote,
to
change
that.
so,
i
do
think
they
still
are
disenfranchised
in
large
part,
if
not
de
jure
in
some
instances,
then
de
facto
because
of
what
they
know
would
happen
to
them
when
they
go
to
the
polling
place.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
think
the
state
has
the
power
to
disenfranchise
people
because
they
are
mentally
retarded.
they
may
have
the
power
to...
i
do
think
the
state
has
the
power
to
disenfranchise
people
if
they
lack
the
minimal
ability
to
understand
the
basics
of
the
workings
of
democracy
or
whatever.
i
realize
that
they
can't
impose
a
literacy
test.
that
has
been
ruled
out
by
this
court.
but--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
i
think
that
neutral
criteria,
and
i
can't
kind
of
give
a
rendition
right
now
of
what
all
those
neutral
criteria
would
be,
but
i
think
neutral
criteria
would
result
in
a
lot
of
severely
mentally
retarded
people
not
being
able
to
vote
statutorily,
but
it
wouldn't
be
because
they
were
mentally
retarded,
but
because
they
failed
to
meet
the
neutral
criteria.
mr.
renea
hicks
it
is
a
consequence
of
an
aspect
of
their
retardation.
that
is
correct.
but
the
problem
with
simply
saying,
for
instance,
a
statute
that
says
a
severely
mentally
retarded
person
cannot
vote,
is
that
it
is
hard
to
tell
down
the
road
what
some
elections
officer
might
say
is
severe
mental
retardation.
some
people
are
of
the
opinion
that
all
mental
retardation
is
severe
enough
to
be
classified
as
severely
mentally
retarded.
i
think--
mr.
renea
hicks
--who
makes
the--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
all,
nearly
all
of
the
statutory
definitions
that
are
used
nationally
now
are
drawn
from
a
basic--
mr.
renea
hicks
--the
american
association
of
mental
deficiency
has--
mr.
renea
hicks
--they
have
a
working
definition
of
what
is
retardation.
mr.
renea
hicks
ultimately
the
legislature,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas,
for
instance,
in
its
mentally
retarded
persons
act--
mr.
renea
hicks
--a
whole
host
of
different
officials,
local
school
district
officials,
for
instance.
mr.
renea
hicks
as
part
of
the--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
local
school
officials,
by
that
i
mean
psychologists--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
you.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
they
have
psychologists
on
your
staff.
mr.
renea
hicks
it
requires
to
carefully
assess
mentally
retarded
people,
it
requires--
mr.
renea
hicks
--no,
your
honor.
i
was
trying
to
point
out--
mr.
renea
hicks
--there
is
no
designated
officer
at
this
point
other
than
a
local
elections
officer,
and
that
is
the
danger
in
setting
a
standard
such
as
justice
rehnquist
has
mentioned.
there
is
a
local
elections
officer
who
sits
at
the
polls,
and
in
the
instance
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
determined
that
this
particular
person
was,
to
use
the
terminology
of
the
statute,
an
idiot.
and
only
two
years
after
or
a
year
after
the
election
was
it
determined
that
this
person
could
vote,
and
so
there
is
no
expert.
mr.
renea
hicks
there
are
parts
of
texas
where
that
is
so.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
mr.
renea
hicks
no,
your
honor.
there
was
not.
i
might
note
that
there
have
been
studies.
i
think
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
by
the
national
conference
on
catholic
charities
discusses
some
of
the
literature
in
this
area
which
seems
to
support
the
idea
that
property
values
are
not
lowered.
mr.
renea
hicks
it
declared...
first,
it
declared
the
statute
on
its
face
unconstitutional.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
am
sorry.
section
8--
mr.
renea
hicks
--section
8,
subdivision--
mr.
renea
hicks
--6,
the
part
that
terms
this
group
home
a
hospital
for
the
feebleminded
says
they
have
to
get
a
special
use
permit,
it
declared
that
unconstitutional.
mr.
renea
hicks
excuse
me?
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
section
8,
subdivision
6--
mr.
renea
hicks
--it
is
both
in
this
instance,
but
in
the
abstract
we
are
not
arguing...
i
need
to
make
that
clear
to
the
court...
we
are
not
arguing
that
no
city
anywhere
in
the
united
states
may
require
special
a
use
permit
for
group
homes
for
mentally
retarded
people.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
your
honor,
given
the
distinctions
and
the
uses
that
are
already
permitted
in
that
district.
many
other
cities
might
have
a
different
set
of
use
classifications,
but
in
this
one,
where
you
have
so
many
similarly
situated
congregate
living
situations
that
are
permitted,
it
makes
no
sense,
and
that
is
the
reason
we
argue
it
is
irrational,
it
makes
no
sense
to
say--
mr.
renea
hicks
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
then
beyond
that
even
if
we
did
have
to
apply,
that
it
is
clear--
mr.
renea
hicks
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
especially
when
the
factfinders,
the
decisionmakers
for
the
city
council
admitted
and
testified
that
they
knew
nothing
about
mental
retardation,
nothing,
or
about
the
needs
of
mentally
retarded
people.
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
it
is
the
very
definition
of
irrationality
when
somebody
makes
a
decision
based
on
a
factor
they
admittedly
know
nothing
about.
i
think,
your
honors,
that
if
what
cleburne
has
done
in
this
case
in
excluding
mentally
retarded
people
from
its
community,
this
group
home
from
its
community,
then
i
think
that,
and
this
is
after
considered
judgment,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
there
is
virtually
no
limit
set
by
the
constitution
on
what
cities
can
do
to
exclude
mentally
retarded
people
from
the
community.
the
actions
of
the
city
council
are
so
baseless
in
this
particular
instance
that
anything
goes,
basically,
if
what
they
have
done
is
constitutional.
thank
you.
