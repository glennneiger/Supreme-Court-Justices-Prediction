justice
white
well,
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
judge
the
case
on
the
basis
that
the
reason
for
the
refusal
of
the
permit
was
that
this
was
a
group
of
mentally
retarded
people?
so
we
have
two
courts
agreeing
that
it
was
the
nature
of
the
occupants
that
made
the
difference,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
we
rarely
disturb
those
kinds
of
findings,
do
we?
justice
white
that
is
true,
but
the
reason
it
is
more
than
a
boarding
house
is
that
they
are
mentally
retarded
people.
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
i
think
your
answer
to
my
question
would
be
yes,
because
this
group
is
different
because
they
are
mentally
retarded.
justice
white
i
notice
that
the
first
argument
you
make
in
your
brief
is
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
the
city's
action.
justice
white
and
that
is
what
you
are
arguing
now,
i
take
it.
justice
white
what
if
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
with
you
with
respect
to
the
standard
under
which
this
action
should
be
judged?
should
it
be
a
rational
basis
or
some
intermediate
level
of
review?
what
if
we
disagree
with
you?
shouldn't
we
remand
and
have
the
case
judged
on
a
rational
basis?
justice
white
they
didn't
touch
the
rational
basis.
justice
white
could
i
ask,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
declare
unconstitutional?
justice
white
what,
the
entire
zoning
ordinance?
justice
white
i
can't
know
what
they
said
was
unconstitutional.
justice
white
six.
justice
white
that
is
16.
justice
white
that
is
16.
justice
white
is
it
your
contention
that
the
city
may
not
require
special
use
permits
for
the
mentally
retarded?
or
is
it
your
claim
that
it
should
have
been
granted,
a
special
use
permit
should
have
been
granted?
justice
white
are
you
arguing
that
this
city
here,
cleburne,
could
not--
justice
white
--constitutionally
require
a
special--
justice
white
--your
position
is,
you
didn't
even
need
to
apply
to
the
city
council
to
establish
this.
justice
white
it
could
not
be
denied
just
because
of
mental
retardation.
justice
white
weren't
the
people
who
were
to
be
in
this
particular
facility
going
to
be
there
voluntarily?
none
of
them
was
going
to
be
committed
against
his
will.
is
that
right?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
so
they
would
have
been
perfectly
free
to
leave
any
time
they
wanted
to.
justice
white
yes,
thank
you.
