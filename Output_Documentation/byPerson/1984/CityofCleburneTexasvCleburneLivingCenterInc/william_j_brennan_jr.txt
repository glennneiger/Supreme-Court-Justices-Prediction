mr.
luna,
you
mentioned
the
junior
high
school
several
times.
what
is
the
significance
of
its
location?
justice
jr.
and
this
might
be
a
danger
to
the
occupants
of
this
house?
justice
jr.
was
that
argument
made
below?
justice
jr.
and
what
happened
to
it?
justice
jr.
yes,
but
mr.
hicks,
i
gather
you
are
here
defending
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit,
aren't
you?
justice
jr.
and
the
circuit
held
that
it
had
to
be
heightened
scrutiny
at
the
intermediate
level,
didn't
it?
justice
jr.
and
do
you
urge
us
to--
justice
jr.
--you
are
just
suggesting
that
if
we
don't
alternatively
we
can
find
there
was
no
rational
basis--
justice
jr.
--but
you
want
us
to
reach
that
if
we
do
only
so
that
you
can
win
without
having
to--
justice
jr.
--yes.
justice
jr.
incidentally,
you
have
not
ever
urged
strict
scrutiny,
have
you?
