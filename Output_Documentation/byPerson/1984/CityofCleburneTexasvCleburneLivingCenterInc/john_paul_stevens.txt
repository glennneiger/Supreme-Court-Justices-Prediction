justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
could
there
have
been
any
other
use
with
the
same
number
of
people
using
this
facility
that
would
have
been
permitted?
justice
stevens
other
than
a
family.
i
mean
such
as
a
halfway
house
or
an
old
people's
home
or
something
like
this.
justice
stevens
but
then
is
it
correct
that
you
are
really
arguing
that
they
shouldn't
allow
13
people
in
this
particular
structure?
justice
stevens
and
it
really
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
whether
they
are
mentally
retarded
or
not.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
may
i
go
back
for
just
a
moment,
mr.
luna,
please,
to
the
statement
about
the
number
of
people
and
other
uses?
the
district
court
found
that
if
the
potential
residents
of
the
home
were
not
mentally
retarded,
but
the
home
was
the
same
in
all
other
respects,
its
use
would
be
permitted
under
the
zoning
ordinance.
justice
stevens
i
am
just
trying
to
be
clear.
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
finding
just
as
it
is
written?
it
seems
to
me
it
says
that
if
they
were
any
other
group
other
than
mentally
retarded
persons,
it
would
have
been
okay
to
use
the
home.
justice
stevens
so
you
are
attacking
that
finding
of
fact?
justice
stevens
well,
it
is
pretty
material
to
me,
i
will
tell
you
that,
as
to
whether
that
is--
justice
stevens
--mr.
luna,
we
have
a
finding
of
fact
in
the
record,
and
i
am
trying
to
decide
whether
we
accept
it
as
a
correct
finding
or
part
of
your
case
involves
setting
aside
that
finding.
which
is
your
position?
justice
stevens
mr.
hicks,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
don't
lose?
justice
stevens
i
am
going
back
to
your
rational
basis
argument
for
a
moment.
often
in
zoning
cases
you
are
concerned
with
property
values.
was
there
any
attempt
made
by
your
opponent
in
this
case
to
prove
that
the
property
values
of
the
neighborhood
would
have
been
affected
in
any
way
by
granting
the
permit
here?
justice
stevens
mr.
luna,
may
i
ask
one
last
question?
when
we
were
asking
about
the
reasons
why
the
special
use
permit
was
denied,
you
mentioned,
of
course,
the
flood
plane
and
across
the
street
from
the
school,
and
both
of
those
were
reasons
that
were
designed
to
protect
the
occupants
of
the
home.
were
there
any
reasons
that
you
would
identify
as
reasons
designed
to
protect
neighbors
from
an
undesirable
change
in
the
neighborhood?
justice
stevens
basically,
they
were
all
for
the
good
of
the
people
who
would
live
there.
justice
stevens
but
you
are
not
relying
on
that,
i
take
it.
justice
stevens
are
you
relying
on
the
complaints
of
the
neighbors?
