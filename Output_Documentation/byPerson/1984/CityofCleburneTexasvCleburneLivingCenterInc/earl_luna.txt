mr.
earl
luna
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
a
zoning
ordinance
of
the
city
of
cleburne,
texas,
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
and
it
involves
a
property
owner
who
wishes
to
contract
with
the
state
of
texas
to
operate
an
intermediate
care
facility
for
13
mildly
and
moderately
mentally
retarded
adults
who
do
not--
mr.
earl
luna
--possess
the
skills
of
independent--
mr.
earl
luna
--20,000.
federal
legislation
authorizes
the
funding
and
therefore
the
different
treatment
of
this
group
of
mentally
retarded
men
and
women
from
other
persons.
the
state
regulations
require
that
the
facility
must
be
located
in
an
incorporated
city
which
is
subject
to
special
use
permits,
local
zoning,
and/or
occupancy
requirements,
and
must
be
non-contiguous
with
an
already
existing
facility.
the
city
of
cleburne
met
these
requirements.
to
operate
such
a
facility
then
in
cleburne
in
accordance
with
the
state
regulations--
mr.
earl
luna
--absolutely.
the
state
regulation
will
not
permit
the
location
of
a
facility
in
a
city
unless
that
city
has
the
special
use
permit
requirements
or
local
zoning
laws.
mr.
earl
luna
absolutely
not,
and
the
state
regulation
is
in
evidence,
and
the
state
statute
in
texas
provides
that
even
if
there
was
a
conflict,
that
the
statute
that
provides
for
the
zoning
regulations
would
prevail
over
the
other,
but
the
state
of
texas
is
just
flat
wrong.
the
regulations
say--
mr.
earl
luna
--absolutely.
mr.
earl
luna
you
will
find
that
in
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
earl
luna
--at
page
78.
mr.
earl
luna
now,
as
i
mentioned,
the
city
met
these
requirements
that
the
state
had,
and
therefore
it
was
necessary
to
apply
for
a
special
use
permit
and
have
a
public
hearing.
at
the
public
hearing
and
in
court,
it
was
developed
that
the
home
would
have
13
mentally
retarded
men
and
women
and
two
staff
employees
in
this
facility.
the
2,510-foot
square...
square
feet
of
house...
in
another
place
the
record
shows
2,700
square
feet...
it
had
only
two
baths,
and
a
half
bath
was
to
be
added.
the
13
unrelated
adults
would
sleep
in
four
bedrooms,
three
adults
in
each
of
three
bedrooms,
and
four
unrelated
adults
in
the
fourth
bedroom.
the
building's
location
on
a
lot
103
feet
wide
and
156
feet
deep,
directly
across
the
street
from
a
junior
high,
with
considerable
school
traffic,
and
in
a
500-year
flood
plain,
was
of
real
concern
to
the
members
of
the
city
council,
because
just
the
year
before
buffalo
creek
had
reached
the
steps
of
201
featherston
street.
and
bobbie
northrop,
one
of
the
corporate
officers
of
clc,
likewise
recognized
this
potential
flood
problem
for
the
residents
of
this
facility
when
she
stated
before
the
planning
commission
and
it
is
in
evidence
as
exhibit
20,
plaintiff's
exhibit
20,
we
would
evacuate
the
residents
and
not
let
the
situation
get
out
of
hand
so
that
an
evacuation
would
not
be
possible.
mr.
earl
luna
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
luna
every
500
years,
but
we
don't
know
whether
it
is
next
month
or
when,
of
course.
mr.
earl
luna
it
did
not
have
a
general
policy
against
building,
but
it
has
building
codes
which
can,
of
course,
require
building
up
so
it
will
be
out.
mr.
earl
luna
no,
sir,
it
is
across
the
street
on
the
high
side.
it
is
higher.
mr.
earl
luna
well,
mental
retardation
is
defined...
i
would
accept
the
american
association
of...
the
definition
as
defined
by
american
association
on
mental
deficiency,
and
dr.
roos,
the
expert
in
this
case,
said
that
it
is
subaverage
general
intelligence
functioning,
existing
concurrently
with
deficits
in
adaptive
behavior.
mr.
earl
luna
i
think
they
did
not
want
to
try
to
define
it.
this
was
a
public
hearing,
and
if
they
had
not--
mr.
earl
luna
--i
am
not
sure
that
is
so.
he
said
that
he
didn't...
he
couldn't
give
a
technical
definition.
there
had
been
a
public
hearing,
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
the
people
who
were
asking
in
a
public
hearing
to
zone
it
so
they
could
have
a
home
for
mentally
retarded
kept
a
secret
from
the
council
what
the
definition
of
mentally
retarded
was.
i
have
an
idea
they
told
them
at
that
hearing.
surely
they
would,
when
they
had
two
public
hearings
on
the
subject.
but
they
were
not
articulate
council
people,
and
they
said
they
were
not
doctors,
and
they
didn't
know
how
to
technically
define
it.
the
special
use
permit
requirement
of
the
ordinance
is
not
invidious.
a
family's
children
can
reside
in
the
home
with
the
family.
but
if
a
person
goes
into
the
business
of
keeping
other
people's
children,
running
a
nursery,
then
this
same
ordinance
requires
them
to
get
a
special
use
permit.
so,
the
same
special
use
permit
that
is
required
to
run
a
home
for
the
mentally
retarded
is
likewise
required
to
run
a
nursery
to
keep
little
children,
the
same
ordinance
and
in
the
same
paragraphs.
the
mentally
retarded
adults
that
were
here
and
proposed
to
be
here
in
this
facility,
i
think,
are
very
much
like
the
ones
involved
in
macon
association
for
retarded
citizens
versus
macon-bibb
county
planning
and
zoning
commission.
this
court
dismissed
the
appeal
of
a
state
court
case
involving
a
zoning
ordinance
with
a
classification
that
was
based
on
mental
retardation
which
were
reviewed
under
the
rational
basis
standard.
the
three
members
of
the
city
council
that
we
are
talking
about
voted
to
deny
the
permit.
one
of
them
who
so
voted
was
a
grandfather
who
had
a
deceased
mentally
retarded
granddaughter.
another
was
a
black
man,
now
deceased,
who
had
spent
several
years
on
the
board
of
directors
of
a
mentally
retarded
facility
in
cleburne
known
as
the
c.c.
cook
developmental
center.
they
apparently
did
not
believe
that
these
four
unrelated
adults
in
one
bedroom
and
requiring
13
people
to
take
a
bath
in
two
bathrooms
constituted
normal
living
conditions
in
the
city
of
cleburne,
and
that
is
what
the
policy
is,
to
try
to
establish
normal
living
conditions.
mr.
earl
luna
yes,
sir.
if
a
family
moved
there,
there
is--
mr.
earl
luna
--that
is
not
covered.
some
other
uses,
the
building
code
requires
fire
walls
and
some
other
things.
it
is
doubtful
that
any
use
other
than
a
single
family
could
have
been
used
with
this
building.
now,
the
land
could
have,
but
the
ordinance
goes
two
ways.
it
regulates
use
of
the
land
and
the
use
of
the
building.
this
building
was
a
wooden
building.
it
had
no
fire
walls,
and
could
not
be
used
for--
mr.
earl
luna
--that
was
one--
mr.
earl
luna
--that's
right,
unless
it's
a
family.
unless
it's
a
family.
mr.
earl
luna
no
special...
but
to
use
a
property
for--
mr.
earl
luna
--yes,
that
is
right,
on
special
use,
but
there
is
another
side
of
the
ordinance
that
requires
off-street
parking
and
other
things
which
would
make
it
questionable
that
you
could
locate
that
many
people
in
this
property.
mr.
earl
luna
that
is
true,
but
if
it
had
been
a
nursery
for
little
children,
it
would
have
been.
mr.
earl
luna
sir?
mr.
earl
luna
i
don't
believe
so,
but
she
asked,
did
we
have
to
have
the
special
use
permit.
we
have
certificate
of
occupancy
statutes
and
other
building
code
requirements
that
would
make
it
very
questionable,
and
the
record
is
not
developed
as
to
what
the
other
ordinances
show
for
a
boarding
house,
for
example,
but
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
chance
in
the
world
that
14
people,
13
people
and
two
staff
members
could
wind
up
using
this
place
as
a
boarding
house
or
anything
else.
now,
the
home
at
that
time,
located
across
the
street
from
the
junior
high
that
we
had
mentioned,
met
the
minimum
state
requirements
at
that
time.
the
state
has
now,
however,
since
this
case
has
come
to
light,
reduced
the
number
of
people
to
be
put
in
one
of
these
homes
in
texas
from
13
to
six,
thereby,
we
think,
recognizing
the
good
judgment
of
the
cleburne
city
council
in
saying
that
this
was
too
many
in
this
particular
house.
the
district
court
found
there
was
a
rational
basis.
mr.
earl
luna
i
think
unquestionably
that
is
true
for
a
family.
it
was
not
developed
as
to
the
off-street
parking
and
that
sort
of
thing
that
would
be
required
for
other
things.
mr.
earl
luna
i
am
not
sure
i
would
completely
agree
with
that
finding.
mr.
earl
luna
well,
i
think
it
is
not
material
here.
mr.
earl
luna
well,
clearly
13
people
in
a
family
could
live
there,
so
certainly
to
that
extent
there
is
no
question
that
the
finding
is
correct,
but
the
record
simply...
you
will
note
that
the
record
did
not
develop
and
part
of
the
ordinance
is
in
evidence
here
on
fire
walls
and
that
sort
of
thing,
so
it
was
not
developed
as
to
what
would
be
the
requirements.
mr.
earl
luna
well,
i
believe
that
in
this
case,
since
a
mentally
retarded
home
in
this
case
requires
more
than
room
and
board,
it
requires
training,
habilitation
training
under
both
the
federal
statute
and
state
regulations,
that
even
if
that
finding
is
not
set
aside,
it
would
not
be
the
same
thing
in
case
for
a
mentally
retarded
home,
because
they
are
different.
and
as
stigner
versus
texas
said,
we
are
not
required
under
the
law
to
treat
different
things,
things
that
are
different
as
if
they
were
the
same.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
different
need
for
mentally
retarded.
mr.
earl
luna
the
nature
of
the
occupants--
mr.
earl
luna
--i
think
it
is
a
little
different
from
that,
though.
these
occupants...
if
we
are
talking
about,
for
example,
a
boarding
house,
all
we
would
need
is
room
and
board.
here,
this
is
more
than
a
boarding
house.
mr.
earl
luna
no,
sir.
it
might
have
been
used
for
a
boarding
house,
but
the
reason
under
this
case,
the
reason
it
would
be...
what
it
is
going
to
be
used
for
is
to
attempt
to
give
habilitation
treatment
to
13
mentally
retarded
people,
none
of
whom
have
the
skills
of
independent
living.
mr.
earl
luna
so
there
is
more
going
on--
mr.
earl
luna
--exactly.
so
that
is
why
i
say,
if
those
findings...
they
are
different
because
they
are
mentally
retarded.
mr.
earl
luna
exactly,
in
a
flood.
i
would
hate
to
be
here
defending
the
city
council
if
they
located
there
and
a
500-year
flood
came
the
next
month
and
we
got
some
people
drowned.
mr.
earl
luna
right.
that's
what
i'm
coming
to
right
now.
the
district
court
found
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
these
decisions,
and
the
district
court
based
its
holding
that
the
mentally
retarded
persons
are
not
a
suspect
or
a
quasi-suspect
class
requiring
heightened
judicial
scrutiny
for
the
fourteen
amendment
equal
protection
analysis
on
the
reasoning
of
the
third
circuit
case
of
doe
versus
colautte.
now,
the
fifth
circuit,
of
course,
reversed,
holding
that
mentally
retarded
people
are
a
quasi-suspect
class.
now,
in
order
to
reach
its
decision,
the
fifth
circuit
created
yet
another
constitutionally
protected
class
consisting
of
all
mentally
retarded
persons
in
the
united
states,
and
we
believe
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
youngberg
versus
romeo.
this
group
is
not
the
discrete
insular
minority
envisioned
by
this
court
in
u.s.
versus
carolene
products,
but
it
is
rather
a
large,
diverse,
and
amorphous
class
proscribed
by
this
court
in
san
antonio
versus
rodriguez.
mental
retardation,
we
have
noted
the
definition
of
it
earlier.
it
is
a
problem
of
reduced
ability
to
learn,
difficulty
with
abstract
thinking,
judgment,
problem-solving,
and
retention,
and
includes
problems
of
social
adjustment
and
economic
productivity.
now,
the
mentally
retarded
are
a
diverse
class,
a
diverse
group
within
themselves,
consisting
of
several
subgroups.
the
mildly
retarded
constitutes
approximately
89
percent
of
all
mentally
retarded
persons.
the
moderately
retarded,
the
severely
retarded,
and
the
profoundly
retarded
are,
of
course,
the
subgroups.
both
the
manifestations
of
retardation
and
the
level
of
care
required
by
each
group
vary
to
extremes
ranging
from
requiring
full-time
institutionalization
to
those
who
are
not
even
discernible
on
casual
contact,
which,
incidentally,
constitutes
the
overwhelming
majority
of
mentally
retarded
persons,
yet
the
fifth
circuit
has
lumped
them
all
together
in
one
class,
the
mentally
retarded.
by
definition,
the
needs
and
capacities
of
the
mentally
retarded
are
different
from
each
other
and
from
the
rest
of
society.
unlike
other
suspect
or
quasi-suspect
groups
such
as
racial
minorities,
women,
aliens,
and
those
of
illegitimate
birth,
whose
stereotyped
characteristics
are
not
reflective
of
their
true
ability
to
perform
or
contribute
to
society,
the
mentally
retarded
characteristics
do
reflect
an
actual
disability.
this
relationship
between
the
stereotyped
disability
and
the
actual
ability
to
perform
was
formalized
by
this
court
in
frontiero
versus
richardson,
and
has
become
the
threshold
entry
into
a
determination
of
suspectness.
classifications
based
on
age
in
massachusetts
retirement
versus
murgia
and
mental
illness
in
doe
versus
colautte
have
been
rejected
as
suspect
on
this
basis.
the
true
novelty
of
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
in
addition
to
a
determination
that
the
mentally
retarded
are
a
quasi-suspect
class
is
in
having
done
so
contrary
to
and
by
completely
ignoring
the
threshold
inquiry
and
then
requiring
application
of
the
heightened
scrutiny
applicable
to
gender
and
legitimacy
to
legislation
involving
the
mentally
retarded.
under
the
fifth
circuit
requirements,
the
mentally
retarded
are
in
what
is
actually
a
no-win
situation.
since
their
needs
are
different
from
the
rest
of
society,
government
can
only
address
those
needs
by
establishing
classifications
based
on
mental
retardation
and
providing
differing
benefits,
and
yet
the
classification
itself
will
fail
if
it
is
only
rational
and
the
government
is
then
precluded
from
bestowing
a
benefit
based
on
the
classification,
and
the
solicitor
general's
brief
deals
with
that
at
length.
heightened
scrutiny
is
not
the
answer
to
the
problems
of
mentally
retarded.
the
legislative
approach,
if
left
unhampered,
will
provide
for
the
needs
of
the
mentally
retarded.
it
is
doing
so
now.
heightened
scrutiny
is
particularly
inappropriate
for
a
zoning
ordinance.
this
court
has
established
a
long
history,
commencing
with
village
of
euclid
versus
amber
realty
through
its
recent
decisions
in
cases
like
village
of
belle
terre
versus
boraas
and
its
recent
decision
by
mr.
justice
stevens
in
members
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
versus
taxpayers
for
vincent.
in
each
of
these
the
court
applied
the
rational
basis
test
to
zoning
classifications,
and
that
has
generally
been
done
unless
the
ordinance
was
racially
exclusive.
otherwise,
if
it
is
fairly
debatable
or
any
set
of
facts
reasonably
may
be
conceived
to
justify
it,
it
must
be
allowed
to
stand.
is
the
city
of
cleburne's
ordinance
fairly
debatable?
of
course
it
is.
we
think
the
ordinance
protected
the
mentally
retarded.
what
exactly
does
this
ordinance
do
in
this
case?
it
allows
the
city
of
cleburne
to
regulate
the
appropriateness
of
the
location
and
the
structure
of
a
business
established
to
provide
icf-mf
care
facility
for
the
mentally
retarded
by
means
of
a
special
use
permit.
mr.
earl
luna
the
ordinance
treats
it
the
other
way.
it
may
be
established
anywhere
in
the
city
of
cleburne--
mr.
earl
luna
--the
answer
is
no.
mr.
earl
luna
the
same
standards
for
renewal
would...
the
ordinance
has
a
standard
for
a
special
use
permit,
and
of
course
the
standards
would
be
the
same.
mr.
earl
luna
i
don't
recall
that.
mr.
earl
luna
there
is
another
case,
but
i
don't
recall
that
in
our
ordinance.
my
memory
may
have
failed
me,
but
i
don't
recall
it.
our
ordinance
goes
the
other
way.
it
is
broader
than
most
ordinances.
you
may
establish
an
icf-mr
facility
any
place
in
the
city
of
cleburne
simply
by
complying
with
the
ordinance
and
making
it
compatible
and
putting
them
in
a
position
that
we
think
permits
humane
treatment
of
mentally
retarded
people
instead
of
warehousing
four
in
a
bedroom
and
13
in
this
small
facility.
mr.
earl
luna
the
junior
high
school,
by
the
way,
has
30
mentally
retarded
people
in
it,
in
the
junior
high
school.
now,
our
evidence
shows
that
mothers
and
fathers
bring
their
kids
to
school,
and
there
is
more
traffic
on
that
street
because
of
the
school
than
there
would
be
on
some
other
street
where
there
was
not
a
junior
high.
mr.
earl
luna
a
danger
to
the
occupants
because
they
are
people
who
do
not
have
the
skills
of
independent
living.
mr.
earl
luna
oh,
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
luna
it
was
disregarded.
the
lower
court,
of
course,
found
that
the
traffic
problem
was
one
of
the
reasons
in
the
findings.
mr.
earl
luna
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
in
regard
to
what
was
said
about
the
statutes
in
favor
of
the
mentally
retarded,
it
is
pointed
out
by
the
fifth
circuit
that
it
is
not
always
easy
to
tell
whether
a
statute
is
to
the
advantage
of
a
mentally
retarded
person
or
is
not
to
the
advantage
of
them.
some
people
might
think
that
it
is
not
good
to
have
somebody
supervising
them
24
hours
a
day.
in
other
cases,
it
might
be
necessary.
therefore,
to
determine
whether
a
particular
statute
is
good
or--
mr.
earl
luna
--in
this
case.
mr.
earl
luna
in
this
case,
that
is
true.
mr.
earl
luna
in
this
case,
they
would
have
been.
mr.
earl
luna
but
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
was
talking
about
in
cases
generally,
and
this
court
has
generally
held
that
the
rights,
that
the
question
involved
in
a
suspect
or
quasi-suspect
class
is
when
the
condition
has
no
relation
to
the
person's
productivity
or
their
contribution
to
society.
now,
in
that
way,
the
mental
retardation
is,
of
course,
completely
different.
it
is
different
from
blacks
and
women
and
the
legitimate
question
where
the
suspect
provisions
have
no
relation
to
their
productivity
or
their
contribution
to
society.
in
this
case,
the
mentally
retarded
persons
must
be
in
many
instances
treated
very
differently,
and
some,
of
course,
to
the
extremes,
have
to
be
placed
in
institutions,
and
they
said
in
this
case
while
they
can
come
and
go,
at
the
same
time
the
records
show
in
this
case
that
they
sometimes
would
also
have
the
authority
to
restrain
them.
now,
texas
has
a
statute
which
affirmatively
protects
the
rights
of
mentally
retarded.
we
have
an
entire
set
of
statutes
on
rights
of
mentally
retarded
and
protecting
those
rights.
now,
while
on
the
one
hand
they
have
raised
the
question
today
about
the
texas
statute,
on
the
other
hand
at
the
court
when
we
tried
this
case
they
dropped
all
of
their
state
claims,
so
they
talk
about
their
state
claims
now,
but
they
were
dropped
out
of
this
lawsuit
at
the
district
court
level.
and
the
two
attorneys
that
represented
the
plaintiffs
in
this
lawsuit,
mr.
hicks
and
his
associate,
are
now
both
with
the
attorney
general's
office,
and
the
other
one
signed...
who
was
with
them,
with
that
office
at
the
time
of
trial
signed
the
brief,
the
attorney
general's
brief.
so,
clearly
the
attorney
general's
position
was
put
forward
in
court
by
the
same
attorneys
who
were
representing
the
plaintiff
but
are
now
signing
the
brief
for
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
earl
luna
i
don't
think
so,
although
we--
mr.
earl
luna
--yes,
sir.
we
did
have
some
neighbors
complain,
but--
mr.
earl
luna
--sir?
mr.
earl
luna
their
counsel's
testimony
was
that
that
was
not
one
of
the
major
factors.
