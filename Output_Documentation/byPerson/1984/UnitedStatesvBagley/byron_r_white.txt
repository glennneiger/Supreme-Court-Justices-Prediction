justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
strauss,
the
judge
on
habeas
certainly
wouldn't
have
gotten
to
a
harmless
error
analysis
unless
he
thought
there
was
error,
and
he
couldn't
have
found
that
there
was
error
unless
he
thought
there
had
been
concealment
of
material
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
suggest
that
it
wasn't
even
material.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
identifying
material
to
show
possible
bias,
i
think
that
is
enough
of
a
finding
of
materiality.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
seem
to...
you
just
wouldn't
be
satisfied
with
winning
this
case
on
the
basis
that
you
won
it
before
the
habeas
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
just
on
a
harmless
error
basis.
it
isn't
on
a
no
materiality
basis
or
on
reviewing
this
on
a
lesser,
less
than
a
harmless
error
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
disagreed
with
that,
wouldn't
we
remand
to
have
them
review
the
district
judge's
determination
of
harmless
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
go
much
farther
than
that
in
the
brief.
in
the
brief
you
want
to
review
this
error,
if
there
is
one,
on
the
basis
of...
on
a
lower
basis
than
the
harmless
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
it
is
unnecessarily
strict,
but
it
certainly
is
indicated
by
our
prior
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
white
constitutional
error.
if
there
is
an
error,
it
is
a
constitutional
error.
justice
white
but
we
shouldn't
review
that
on
the
ordinary
harmless
error
basis.
justice
white
well,
if
there
isn't
any
error...
what
kind
of
an
error
is
it
if
it
isn't
a
constitutional
error?
justice
white
that
isn't
a
constitutional
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
us
to
decide
that
they
really
do
have
an
obligation
under
brady
to
turn
it
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
judge
the
case
on
that
basis,
then,
then
we
are
assuming
a
constitutional
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
what?
assuming
that,
that
this
standard
was
the
wrong...
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
saying
there
should
be
an
automatic
reversal,
what
then?
if
we
assume
that
there
was
a
constitutional
error,
what
do
we
do?
justice
white
were
you
trial
counsel?
justice
white
were
you
counsel
in
the
habeas?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
--why
not?
justice
white
yes,
but
if
there
hadn't
been
those
representations,
you
normally
would
have
asked
them...
the
trial
counsel
would
normally
have
asked
if
they
had
been
paid
or
if
any
promises
had
been
made
to
them.
is
that
right?
justice
white
well,
so
isn't
a
lot
of
cross
examination
shooting
in
the
dark?
justice
white
mr.
hillier,
what
do
you
think
is
the
standard
for
judging
the
materiality
of
this
failure
to
produce?
is
it
the
agurs
standard?
justice
white
why
chapman?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
is
a
harmless
error
standard,
isn't
it?
justice
white
i
mean,
it
says
there
is
an
error,
but
under
agurs
there
is
no
constitutional
error
at
all
unless
the
omitted
evidence
creates
a
reasonable
doubt
that
did
not
otherwise
exist.
if
the
omitted
evidence
creates
such
a
reasonable
doubt,
there
is
constitutional
error,
and
you
never
reach
a
harmless
error
standard.
you
can't
reach
a
harmless
error
standard.
justice
white
isn't
that
the
agurs
standard?
justice
white
where
do
you
get
out
of
agurs
that
there
is
a
different
standard
for
a
specific
request?
justice
white
all
that
means
to
me
is
that
seldom
if
ever
would
there
not
be
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
white
that
is
the
same...
is
there
any
difference
between
that
and
just
reasonable
doubt?
justice
white
what
do
you
think
this
standard,
this
reasonable
doubt
standard
i
just
read
to
you
is,
a
constitutional
error
standard?
i
thought
it
was.
what
kind
of
a...
is
this
a
non-constitutional
standard?
justice
white
i
am
asking
you
now
under
the
test
in
agurs
for
a
general
request.
justice
white
it
would
still
have
to
be
a
constitutional
issue
to
reach
any
state
case,
or
a
federal
case
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
agurs
and
strickland
to
say
that
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
at
all
unless
what
was
done
or
not
done
would
have
created
a
reasonable
doubt
that
otherwise
would
not
have
existed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
such
a
doubt
exists,
there
is
no
occasion
or
reason
to
reach
the
harmless
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
white
well,
now,
tell
me
what...
i
thought
i
understood
your
brief
to
say
that
agurs
and
the
government
would...
well,
you
say
agurs
did
not
establish
a
different
standard
for
a
specific
request.
justice
white
well,
and
i
thought
your
brief
said
that
the
same
standard
should
apply
to
specific
requests.
justice
white
well,
what
if
it
were
perfectly
true
in
this
case
that
the
government
committed...
they
just
perjured
themselves
in
these
affidavits?
what
if
it
were
perfectly
clear?
you
say
it
isn't
clear,
that
it
was
just
a
lot
of
general
things.
justice
white
yes,
but
what
if
it
was
clear
that
they
did?
justice
white
no,
no,
in
these
affidavits.
justice
white
would
you
approach
it
from
the
standpoint
of
a
fair
trial
issue?
justice
white
you
would,
still
would?
justice
white
not
just
some
supervisory
way
of
censoring
the
prosecutor?
