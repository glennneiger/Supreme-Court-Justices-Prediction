mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
awarded
respondent
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
that
the
government
had
not
disclosed
to
respondent
certain
documents
in
its
files
that
respondent
claims
he
could
have
used
to
impeach
two
government
witnesses.
the
issue
concerns
the
standard
of
materiality
that
should
be
applied
in
determining
whether
such
evidence
is
significant
enough
to
require
a
new
trial.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
indicated
in
1977
on
multiple
counts
of
violating
federal
narcotics
and
firearms
statutes.
before
trial,
respondent
served
on
the
government
eleven
broadly
worded
discovery
requests.
among
those
requests
was
the
one
that
has
now
become
the
focus
of
the
case,
a
request
for
any
deals,
promises,
or
inducements
made
to
prospective
government
witnesses
in
exchange
for
their
testimony.
in
response
to
all
the
various
discovery
requests,
the
government
gave
the
defense
a
large
number
of
documents.
now,
respondent
elected
to
waive
a
jury
trial,
and
he
was
tried
by
district
judge
vorhees
of
the
western
district
of
washington.
among
the
witnesses
against
him
were
two
state
law
enforcement
officers
named
o'connor
and
mitchell,
who
had
witnessed
criminal
transactions
involving
respondent
while
they
were
operating
in
an
undercover
capacity.
o'connor
and
mitchell
were
supervised
during
the
investigation
of
respondent
by
the
federal
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms,
atf.
at
trial,
o'connor
and
mitchell
testified
primarily
about
the
firearms
charges.
now,
after
the
seven-day
trial,
judge
vorhees
found
respondent
not
guilty
on
the
firearms
charges,
but
guilty
on
the
narcotics
charges.
some
years
later,
respondent
filed
a
freedom
of
information
act
request,
and
he
uncovered
two
form
atf
contracts
that
had
been
signed
by
o'connor
and
mitchell
before
the
trial,
but
that
were
not
among
the
materials
delivered
by
the
government
to
the
defense.
respondent
then
brought
this
action
for
collateral
relief
under
28
usc
2255,
alleging
that
if
he
had
known
of
these
form
contracts
at
the
time
of
the
trial
he
could
have
used
them
to
impeach
o'connor
and
mitchell.
respondent's
2255
motion
came
before
judge
vorhees.
the
prosecutor
testified
at
a
hearing
that
he
had
been
unaware
of
the
form
contracts,
which
apparently
were
in
atf
files,
and
that
if
he
had
been
aware
of
them,
he
would
have
given
them
to
respondent.
judge
vorhees
found
that
well
after
the
trial
o'connor
and
mitchell
were
each
paid
$300
by
atf,
but
that
the
atf
form
contracts
were
blank
when
o'connor
and
mitchell
signed
them,
that
no
aft
representative
signed
them
until
after
the
trial,
and
that
no
government
agent
at
any
time
had
promised
o'connor
or
mitchell
compensation
for
his
services
or
his
testimony
or
anything
else.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right,
justice
stevens.
there
was
a
finding,
however,
that
at
the
time
they
were
signed
by
the
witnesses,
o'connor
and
mitchell,
and
in
fact
at
the
time
of
the
trial
the
only
thing
typed
into
them
was
the
unique
identifier,
a
numerical
code
in
the
upper
righthand
corner.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
was
no
finding
about
the
name
mitchell.
i
assume
it
was
typed
in
at
the
time.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
the
finding.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
believe
the
testimony
of
the
supervising
atf
agent,
named
prins.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
that
is
right.
judge
vorhees
further
found
that
o'connor
and
mitchell
had
at
most
a
unilateral
expectation
that
they
might
receive
some
compensation
for
their
services,
although
not
necessarily
for
their
testimony.
finally,
judge
vorhees
ruled
that
since
he
himself
had
found
respondent
guilty,
he
was
uniquely
positioned
to
determine
the
impact
that
the
atf
form
contracts
would
have
had
on
the
trial,
and
he
stated
that
he
was
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
form
contracts
would
have
made
no
difference
to
his
verdict.
now,
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
ordered
that
respondent
be
granted
a
new
trial.
this
happened
in
1983,
six
years
after
respondent
was
convicted.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
explain
at
any
point
in
its
opinion
why
judge
vorhees
was
mistaken
in
concluding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
his
own
verdict
would
not
have
been
affected
by
the
form
contracts.
instead,
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
and
i
am
reading
the
last
sentence
of
its
opinion,
"we
hold
that
the
government's
failure
to
provide
requested
brady
information
to
the
respondent
so
that
he
could
effectively
cross
examine
two
important
government
witnesses
requires
an
automatic
reversal.
"
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
do
not
dispute
that
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
the
prosecution
has
an
obligation
to
disclose
purely
impeaching
material.
that
is
right,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
this
case,
we
would
submit,
is
not
one
of
them.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
you
mean
for
judge
vorhees
to
say?
oh,
i
think
very
much
so,
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
can
understand,
justice
marshall,
where
a
judge
might
in
fact
have
an
overreaction
the
opposite
way
and
be
incensed
that
this
material
was
not
brought
to
his
attention.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think
that
is
certainly
right,
justice
marshall,
and
there
are
decisions
of
this
court
predicated
on
that,
but
judge--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
am
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
judge
vorhees
found
respondent
guilty
on
the
basis
of
a
record
which
turned
out
according
to
respondent
to
be
incomplete,
and
i
think
judge
vorhees
might
very
well
have
reacted
the
other
way
and
said
that
if
the
government
was
going
to
conceal
this
information,
he
would
teach
it
a
lesson.
it
is
not
obvious
to
me
that
the
psychology
cuts
in
favor
of
the
government
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
these
form
contracts
were
not
before
the
court.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right,
is
whether
those
had
been--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
were
affidavits
that
judge
vorhees
had
that
the
respondent
but
not
the
court
of
appeals
has
made
quite
an
issue
of.
these
were
affidavits
that
were
submitted
to
the
respondent
in
response
to
a
different
discovery
request.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
could
not
have
understood
that
there
were
no
such
contracts
in
those
affidavits
because
the
affidavits
made
no
such
representation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
affidavits
were
long,
detailed
recountings
of
the
undercover
dealings
between
the
witnesses
and
the
defendant,
and
they
concluded
with
a
recital
that
said,
i
have
made
these
statements
free
of
threats
or
promises
or
promises
of
reward.
each
of
them
concluded
with
that
boilerplate
recital.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
they
signed
those
affidavits.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
is
not
clear.
i
could
not
find
any
place
where
those
affidavits
were
actually
introduced
into
evidence
by
respondent.
respondent
had
the
affidavits.
they
were
jencks
act
material
given
to
respondent.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
that
is
not
right,
justice
stevens.
the
statements
were
not
false.
there
was
a
finding
of
no
promises.
they
are
not
false
for
several
reasons.
there
is
a
finding
that
no
promises
were
made
to
these
witnesses,
that
at
most
they
had
a
unilateral
expectation
that
something
would
be
given
to
them.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
judge
who
concluded
that
was
the
judge
on
habeas
proceedings--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--who
had
before
him...
the
entire
record
before
him.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
not
the
trial...
he
was
the
trial
judge,
but
he
was
the
trial
judge
sitting
in
the
habeas
proceeding.
it
was
the
same
judge,
but
he
concluded
that
at
the
time
of
the
2255
motion.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
testimony,
justice
stevens,
that
they
gave
was
that
while
they
were
conducting
this
investigation,
they
were
busy
signing
a
lot
of
forms
that
were
shown
to
them
by
the
case
agent,
and
they
basically
didn't
know
what
the
forms
were
for.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right,
but
the
judge
upheld
the
magistrate's
finding.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
was
in
the
habeas
proceeding
in
1981.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
prior
judgment
was
based
on
different
evidence
from
the
evidence
that
was
before
him
at
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
don't
know
whether
that
constitutes
review
of
the
prior
judgment
or
not.
it
does
not
constitute
review
in
the
sense
of
any
appellate
review
or
of
any
second
guessing
of
the
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
of
course
he
knew
what
he
decided
in
the
first
place,
but
the
point
is
that
the
judge
had
no...
the
factors
that
operate
in
cases
like
santa
pella
to
cause
judges
to
have
a
commitment
to
the
decision
they
previously
reached
so
that
they
will
be
unwilling
to
overturn
that
decision
do
not
operate
here,
because
there
is
new
evidence.
and
as
i
suggested
in
my
colloquy
with
justice
marshall,
may
even
operate
in
the
opposite
direction,
because
the
judge
may
be
annoyed
at
the
suppression...
at
the
alleged
suppression
of
evidence
by
the
government.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
am
not
sure
that
the
government
would
have
had
an
obligation.
well,
no,
i
am
sure.
the
government
would
not
have
had
an
obligation
to
produce
this
material,
i
think,
in
the
absence
of
a
request.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
witnesses
testified
on
both,
but
their
testimony
was
primarily
on
the
firearms
charges.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
they
were
acquitted
on
that
charge.
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
is
not
jencks
act,
justice
marshall,
because
it
is
not
a
statement.
it
is
not
brady
material
in
my
view
because
this
is
simply
not
evidence
that
seriously
draws
into
question
the
witnesses'
credibility.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
united
states
attorney
said
that
if
he
had
had
these
documents--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
it
would
have
been
very
good
practice
for
him
to
do
it.
i
think
he
gave
the
right
answer.
it
would
make...
one
of
the
features
of
the
law
in
this
area
is
that
it
really
makes
no
sense
for
the
united
states
attorney
not
to
go
overboard
and
to
do
far
more
than
he
is
obligated
to
do,
because
if
he
doesn't,
what
is
likely
to
happen
is
just
what
happened
in
this
case.
six
years
down
the
road
these
documents
will
be
uncovered
and
he
will
have
to
relitigate
all
of
these
issues.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
think
that
is
right,
justice
o'connor,
although
that
is
not
the
argument
we
are
primarily
relying
on.
the
request
was
for
deals,
promises,
or
inducements
made
in
return
for
the
testimony.
that
is
different
from
whether
the
government
would
compensate
these
people
for
their
services.
i
think
it
is
one
thing
to
compensate
a
person
for
specifically
giving
certain
testimony
in
court
and
another
to
say
that
because
he
has
performed
certain
undercover
services
he
will
receive
compensation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
there
is
a
difference
in
the
effect
that
would
have
on
the
credibility
of
the
witness,
but
i
would
add
that
that
is
not...
our
primary
argument
is
not--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
that
is
probably
right,
justice--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
a
defense
attorney
probably
would
want
to
inquire
into
that.
the
defense
attorney
in
this
case--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
one
of
the
findings
that
the
district
judge
made
in
this
case
was
that
the
defense
attorney's
cross
examination
tactic
was
not
to
try
to
undermine
the
witness's
credibility,
but
to
try
to
enlist
them
on
his
side.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
didn't
know
of
the
existence
of
these
form
contracts.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
is
no
finding
to
that
effect,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--he
asked
for
deals,
promises...
he
made
an
omnibus
request
for
deals,
promises,
or
inducements
in
exchange
for
the
testimony,
not
for
anything
specific
like
this.
one
possible
cross
examination
approach,
justice
brennan,
would
have
been
to
pursue
that
line,
without
a
doubt,
but
this
defense
attorney
did
not
pursue
that
line.
he
never
even
asked--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think,
justice
white--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think,
justice
white,
that
the
judge
on
habeas
found
there
was
harmless
error
in
order
to
avoid
having
to
rule
whether
it
was
even
material
or
within
the
request
at
all.
he
looked
at
the
documents
and
said,
these
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
to
me
and
there
is
no
point
in
pursuing
this
matter
further.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
these
were
blank...
the
finding
was,
these
were
blank
contracts
with
only
the
witnesses'
signatures
on
it,
that
no
promises
of
any
kind
were
made
to
the
witnesses,
and
that
ultimately
the
witnesses
were
paid
some
money,
well
after
the
trial.
i
think
to
suggest
that
the
witnesses'
credibility
would
have
been
substantially
impaired
at
all
by
the
fact
that
they
signed
one
of
these
documents
i
think
is
incorrect.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
essentially,
that's
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
$300
apiece.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
plus
expenses.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
would
be
more
than
satisfied
to
win
this
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
question
we
presented
concerned
the
harmless
error
issue,
and
we
would
be
more
than
happy
just
to
get
rid
of
the
ninth
circuit's
automatic
reversal
rule,
which
we
think
is
completely
unfounded.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
that
is
right,
justice
white.
if
you
disagreed
with
the
automatic
reversal
rule,
you
would
have
to
remand
for
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
than
the
constitutional
harmless
error
rule.
that
is
right,
justice
white,
for
just
that
reason,
that
if
the
court
should
remand,
little
purpose
would
be
served
by
having
the
court
simply
remand
to
have
the
ninth
circuit
review
it
under
a
harmless
error
rule
that
we
think
is
unnecessarily
strict
to
us
and
not
necessarily
generous
to--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
white.
what
the
prior
cases
of
the
court
indicate
is
that
this
is
the
approach
to
be
applied
in
cases
where
the
government
has
knowingly
introduced
perjured
testimony,
and
it
is
our
submission
that
this
sort
of--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--it
is
the
standard
that
applies
to
constitutional
error.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
failure
to
disclose
these
documents
is
not
constitutional
error.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
constitution
that
says
the
government
has
to
disclose
these
documents.
the
question
is
what
standard
of
materiality.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
is
an
error
if
it
leads
to
the
trial
being
unfair.
the
question
is--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--if
the
trial
is
unfair
it
is
certainly
a
constitutional
error.
that's
right.
but
the
prior
question
is
whether
the
non-disclosure
of
these
relative,
rather
innocuous
documents
infected
the
trial
with
unfairness.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
court
has
never
squarely
held
that
the
government
has
to
turn
over
such
material.
i
think
that
is
right,
justice
rehnquist.
but
as
we
said,
we
don't
dispute--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--we,
as
i
said,
don't
dispute
that
in
some
circumstances--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
don't
follow
that,
justice
white.
if
the
court...
we
would
be
happy
if
the
court
were
to
assume
that
these
documents
were
in
some
sense
probative
or
relevant
or
useful,
but
to
find
that
the
automatic
reversal
rule
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
a
correct
one.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
see
why
this...
the
assumption
is
not
that
there
was
constitutional
error,
justice
white.
the
failure
to
disclose
information
like
this
is
not
constitutional
error.
all
that
the
failure
to
disclose
information
like
this
does
is
raise
a
question
whether
the
trial
was
fair.
and
the
issue
is
how
material
this
evidence
must
be
in
order
to
cause
us
to
question
the
basic
fairness
of
the
trial.
our
submission
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
find
that
the
evidence
would
not
have
affected
the
outcome
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
order
to
conclude
that
the
trial
was
fair,
that
a
much
lower
threshold
is
appropriate.
the
court
dealt
with
an
issue
quite
similar
to
this,
obviously,
in
united
states
against
agurs,
where
the
court
specified
a
standard
of
materiality
for
cases
in
which
the
defense
either
does
not
request
information
from
the
government's
files
or
makes
a
general
request,
and
the
agurs
standard
is
that
the
defendant
must
show
that
the
undisclosed
evidence
raises
a
reasonable
doubt
about
his
guilt.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
standard
would
be
an
appropriate
standard
to
apply
here
rather
than
the
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
test
that
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
they
are,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
it
was
responsive
to
paragraph
6,
which
is
the
one
we
are
disputing,
then
i
think
it
would
be
responsive
to
that
as
well.
we
would
dispute
that
this
has--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
respondent
has
never
relied
on
paragraph
eleven
as
a
basis
for
this.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think
probably,
justice
stevens,
because
it
was
understood
that
this
had
to
do
with
collateral
proceedings
attacking
the
search
warrant,
and
not
with
the
trial
in
chief,
but
that
is
speculation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
as
i
said,
the
agurs
standard
applies
in
cases
where
there
has
been
a
general
request,
and
this
really
follows
from
justice
stevens's
last
question.
the
request
in
this
case
was
for
deals,
promises,
or
inducements.
and
in
our
view,
it
is
not
appropriate
to
regard
that
as
a
specific
request
in
the
contemplation
of
agurs.
if
a
prosecuting
attorney
receives
a
truly
specific
request,
a
request,
for
example,
for
the
criminal
record
of
the
victim,
or
a
request
also
from
a
defendant
contemplating
a
defense
of
self-defense
for
any
evidence
in
the
government's
possession
that
the
victim
committed
acts
of
violence.
if
a
prosecuting
attorney
receives
a
request
like
that,
we
know
with
some
clarity
precisely
what
he
is
to
do.
he
is
to
go
to
his
files
and
look
for
certain
specific
information,
and
he
is
to
give
instructions
to
the
law
enforcement
officers
working
on
the
case
that
they
are
to
come
forward
with
certain
specific
documents
or
evidence
if
they
have
it.
it
seems
to
us
that
when
a
prosecuting
attorney
receives
a
request
like
respondent's
for
deals,
promises,
or
inducements,
he
is
really
in
no
better
position
than
he
would
have
been
in
if
he
had
received
no
request
at
all.
he
has
a
duty
under
brady
and
agurs.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
who
would
be
paid
for
their
testimony?
yes,
certainly,
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
justice
marshall.
there
is
no
finding
that
they
were
paid
for
their
testimony.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
they
performed
undercover
operations
over
a
period
of
several
months,
and
then
were
compensated
for
that.
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
know,
justice
stevens.
my
offhand
reaction
would
be
that
that
proves
too
much,
because
there
obviously
weren't
that
many.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
contracts.
i
don't
know
the
answer.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
one
or
two
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
discussed
the
affidavits,
which
i
think
are
a
pure
red
herring
in
our
redly
brief,
and
i
won't
pursue
them
further.
we
also
mention
in
our
reply
brief
that
in
addition
to
the
testimony
of
the
agents,
there
was
a
search
of
the
defendant's
residence
that
found
some
controlled
substances.
i
have
two--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
is
right.
there
was
also
that
evidence
in
the
case,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
think
it
is
clear
which
ones
he
went
to
jail
on.
he
received
probation
which
was
subsequently
revoked
on
all
counts.
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
their
testimony
was
unimportant
on
any
of
them.
but
there
was
additional
evidence.
it
is
a
mistake
to
say
that
their
testimony
was
the
only
evidence
in
the
case.
i
want
to
make
one
point
about
what
has
happened
generally
in
this
area
since
agurs,
and
then
one
point
about
this
case
in
particular.
in
agurs,
the
court
specified
a
standard
that
would
apply
to
no
request
or
general
request
cases,
and
the
court
said
that
a
request
for
all
brady
material
or
all
helpful
material
would
be
a
general
request.
but
the
court
left
open
the
possibility
that
a
specific
request
would
be
judged
by
a
different
standard.
now,
i
think
what
the
response
to
that
has
been,
and
this
case
is
an
excellent
example
of
it,
is
that
defense
counsel
have
tried
to
take
the
general
request
for
all
brady
material
and
break
it
down
into
a
dozen
or
so
abstract
categories,
all
deals,
promises,
and
inducements,
all
information
casting
doubt
on
the
reliability
of
the
witnesses,
all
statements.
they
have
tried
to
rephrase
the
general
request
into
requests
that
while
not
as
all-encompassing,
when
taken
together
cover
the
waterfront,
and
as
mr.
hillier
was
arguing,
that
was
essentially
the
way
he
presented
his
requests.
he
said,
we
wanted
to
know
everything
they
had.
we
wanted
to
know
if
there
was
anything
that
would
cast
doubt
on
the
testimony
of
these
agents.
and
he
suggested
that
when
the
prosecutor
received
these
discovery
requests,
he
should
have
gone
to
the
agents
and
said,
is
there
anything
we
should
let
the
defendant
know?
that
is
our
point
exactly.
these
were
essentially
general
requests
that
left
the
prosecutor
no
better
off
than
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
just
gotten
a
request
for
all
brady
information
or
no
request
at
all.
he
would
have
had
to
go
to
the
agents
and
say,
is
there
anything
we
should
let
the
defendant
know?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
think
there
are
some
true
specific
request
cases
where
you
have
a
truly
focused
specific
request
where
an
argument
can
be
made
for
a
more
exacting
standard
than
agurs.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right,
because
then
you
know
the
trial
was
unfair,
and
you
have
to
have
a
new
trial.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
that
is
exactly
right,
justice
white.
in
fact,
i
realize,
justice
white,
i
should
have
answered
your
earlier
question
by
quoting
from
agurs
at
page
108,
where
it
says
precisely
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
it
did
not...
it
left
the
question
open.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
left
open
the
possibility,
as
justice
o'connor
noted,
that
there
may
be
some
true
specific
request
cases
in
which
a
standard
more
exacting
than
agurs
would
be
appropriate,
although
not
a
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
which
we
think
should
be
reserved
for
truly
egregious
cases
like
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
it
is
clear
they
did
not
perjure
themselves.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
they
perjured
themselves
in
the
trial,
then
giglio
and
napue--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
that
would
probably
not
even
be
a
brady
question.
i
think
that
would
be
a
more
general
fairness
problem.
it
would
be
as
if
the
prosecutor
lied
to
the
defense
counsel
in
a
series
of
colloquies
or
in
some
other
way
took
steps
to
mislead
him.
it
would
present
a
fairness
problem,
but
not
one
that
really
lends
itself
to
brady
and
agurs.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
might
be
appropriate
to
censor
the
prosecutor
as
well.
i
think
there
may
be
cases
in
which
prosecutorial
misleading
of
the
defense
would
reach
a
level
to
call
the
fairness
of
the
trial
into
question.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
