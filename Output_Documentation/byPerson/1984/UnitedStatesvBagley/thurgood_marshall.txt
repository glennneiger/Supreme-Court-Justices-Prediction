justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
imagine
any
way
this
case
could
have
gone
the
other
way
and
for
the
judge
to
say
i
was
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
i
think
it
is
a
horrible
burden
to
put
on
somebody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
were
told
to
explain
why
you
did
something
six
years
ago,
your
subconscious
tells
you
to
defend
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
again,
why
isn't
it
jencks
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
that
the
government
apologized
for
not
knowing
it
was
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
would
he
do
that
if
he
wasn't
required
to
produce
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
asked
for
them,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
he
had
had
a
request
for
the
names
of
any
proposed
witnesses
who
would
be
paid
for
their
testimony.
would
that
be
specific
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
really,
that
is
what
they
wanted
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
just
that
they
testified
and
they
were
paid.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
go
back
to
justice
rehnquist's
question.
this
is
a
hypothetical.
the
same
type
of
trial
as
this,
and
they
produced
these
two
contracts,
and
the
judge,
trying
it
without
a
jury,
says,
have
gone
over
the
evidence,
including
these
contracts,
which
i
disregard,
and
find
him
guilty.
would
that
stand
up
on
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
habeas?
anything
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
stand
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
admit
you
could
not
reverse
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
exact
same
facts
of
this
case.
the
only
difference
is,
the
two
contracts
were
put
in
evidence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
judge
said,
despite
these,
i
still
find
you
guilty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
tell
you
what
the
answer
would
be
if
they
had
been
paid
and
it
was
known
they
had
been
paid.
the
first
question
the
prosecution
would
ask,
have
you
been
paid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
the
way
it
is
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
it
is
not
done
that
way,
the
defendant
automatically
asks,
are
you
paid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
adversary
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
first
one
had
been
turned
over,
you
wouldn't
have
gotten
those
affidavits.
