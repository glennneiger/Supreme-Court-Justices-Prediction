justice
jr.
but,
mr.
strauss,
wasn't
there
an
affidavit
or
something
denying
that
anything
like
this
occurred
that
judge
vorhees
had?
justice
jr.
i
know,
but
did
judge
vorhees
have
those?
did
he
understand
that
there
were
no
such
contracts
from
those
affidavits?
justice
jr.
what
did
the
affidavits
show?
justice
jr.
and
o'connor
and
the
other
officer
signed
those
affidavits?
justice
jr.
and
judge
vorhees
had
those?
justice
jr.
yes,
but
might
not
the
judge
have
concluded
that
based
on
that
statement
that
justice
stevens
referred
to
in
those
affidavits?
justice
jr.
i
see.
justice
jr.
not
the
trial
judge?
justice
jr.
the
fact
finder
would
certainly
regard
as
rather
substantial
evidence
that
a
government
witness
was
being
paid,
whether
in
return
for
a
promise
or
anything
else,
wouldn't
he?
justice
jr.
attorneys
would
love
to
have
evidence
like
that,
wouldn't
they?
justice
jr.
and
you
suggest
it
is
not
good
impeachment
material?
justice
jr.
would
want
to?
i
would
think
he
would
be
ineffective
if
he
didn't.
justice
jr.
but
he
didn't
know
of
the
existence
of
these
contracts
when
he
was
cross
examining
these
witnesses.
justice
jr.
if
he
had,
he
would
certainly
have
been
after
them,
wouldn't
he?
justice
jr.
common
sense
would
tell
you
that.
justice
jr.
how
much
did
they
get
paid?
justice
jr.
mr.
hillier,
if
we
should
agree
with
you,
what
about
the
holding
that
this
required
automatic
reversal?
justice
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
do
we
do
it,
or
do
we
say
they
were
wrong
to
require
automatic
reversal?
do
we
send
it
back?
