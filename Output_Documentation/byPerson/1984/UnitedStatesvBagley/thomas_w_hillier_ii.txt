mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
it
please
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
respondent's
constitutional
right
to
confront
and
cross
examine
his
accusers
was
materially
obstructed
as
a
result
of
the
government's
failings
in
this
case.
as
a
result,
at
issue
here
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
reasoned
that
the
non-disclosure
in
this
case
resulted
in
constitutional
error
and
whether
it
applied
the
appropriate
standard
in
reaching
that
decision.
we
obviously
disagree
with
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
consider
the
issue
of
materiality
at
all,
and
we
take
strenuous
exception
to
its
characterization
of
this
sort
of
evidence
that
wasn't
disclosed
as
non-constitutional,
and
its
attempts
to
sort
of
trivialize
its
meaningfulness
within
the
context
of
this
case.
and
i
think
in
order
to
resolve
the
case
and
to
really,
truly
determine
what
the
character
of
that
evidence
was
in
relation
to
your
decision,
we
have
to
look
to
the
facts,
because
there
are
several
facts,
as
you
have
already
discussed
in
your
questions
of
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
which
are
especially
relevant
to
this
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
i
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
an
assistant
federal
public
defender
in
my
office
was,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
i
have
represented
mr.
bagley
on
prior
occasions,
but
i
was
not
counsel
in
this
case.
the
developments
which
occasioned
this
case
occurred
back
in
april
and
may
of
1977,
and
during
that
time
these
two
railroad
employees
were
under
the
direct
supervision
of
one
single
case
agent
in
this
case,
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
mr.
norm
prins.
between
april
12th
and
may
4th
of
1977,
the
two
of
them
executed
four
separate
affidavits
each,
a
total
of
eight
affidavits,
detailing
their
contacts
with
mr.
bagley
within
the
context
of
their
investigation,
and
at
the
end
of
each
one
of
those
affidavits,
the
boilerplate
paragraph
indicated
by
counsel
stated
that
they
had
received
no
rewards
or
promises
of
rewards
in
return
for
the
statement
that
they
had
just
made.
on
may
3rd,
1977,
the
day
before
each
of
these
individuals
signed
in
the
presence
of
mr.
prins,
they
executed
the
contract
which
is
at
issue
here
today,
a
contract
which
is
labeled
for
the
purchase
of
information
and
payment
of
lump
sum
therefore.
on
may
3rd
they
executed
that
contract,
indicating
an
expectation,
an
objective
expectation
of
return
for
their
investigative
efforts.
on
the
following
day,
they
executed
again
affidavits
indicating
that
they
had
not.
mr.
prins
supervised
and
observed
both
of
these
signings
one
day
apart.
pretrial,
as
indicated,
mr.
lundine,
who
was
representing
mr.
bagley,
filed
a
comprehensive
brady...
or
a
comprehensive
discovery
motion.
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
pretrial
request
came
in
november
of
1977,
a
year
after
the
agurs
decision,
which
required
some
sort
of
specificity
if
we
are
going
to
have
the
complaint
that
we
do
here
today.
within
that
pretrial
discovery
request,
mr.
lundine
requested,
as
indicated,
any
promises
or
expectation...
promises
or
inducements
made
to
witnesses
in
exchange
for
testimony,
but
that
is
not
all,
and
we
don't
rely
upon
that
solely.
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
the
request
was
comprehensive.
it
goes
on.
if
i
could,
and
it
is
in
the
record,
of
course,
mr....
pursuant
to
brady
in
a
subsequent
paragraph
mr.
lundine
requested
"notice
and
copies
of
all
material
in
possession
of
the
government
which
is
exculpatory,
which
may
be
favorable
to
the
defendants
or
would
assist
in
the
preparation
of
the
defense,
including
promises
or
representations
of
any
kind
made
to
government
witnesses.
"
and
finally,
he
stated,
"i
would
also
request
any
information
which
goes
to
the
reliability
of
the
two
government
witnesses
in
this
case
that
are
the
subject
of
this
inquiry
as
it
relates
to
the
search
warrant.
"
so,
there
were
three
separate
recitals
in
that
discovery
motion
requesting
information
about
any
sorts
of
inducements
or
representations
or
promises
which
may
have
been
made
to
the
witnesses
in
this
case
which
may
in
effect
taint
their
testimony.
in
that
same
month,
on
november
30th,
the
government
responded
to
that
request
and
indicated
in
their
discovery
response
that
all
statements
made
by
these
two
witnesses
had
been
turned
over
to
the
defense,
including
the
affidavits
which
are
at
issue
here.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
that
response
government
counsel
represented
that
these
were
the
two
principal
government
witnesses.
missing,
of
course,
was
the
contract
to
purchase
and
pay
for
information
provided
in
return
for
their
services.
we
submit
that
agent
prins,
who
failed
to
disclose
that
document,
however,
didn't
forget
about
it.
trial
commenced
in
mid-december,
from
december
12th
until
december
23rd.
on
december
21st,
before
the
trial
was
even
over,
agent
prins
went
to
his
supervisor
with
the
contracts
in
question
and
requested
payment
to
each
of
these
individuals,
$500,
in
return,
as
he
stated
in
his
documents,
which
are
before
the
court,
for
their
investigative
efforts
and
for
their
testimony
at
trial.
during
trial
agent
prins
did
this,
despite
having
turned
over
nothing
with
regard
to
those
representations
to
counsel
for
the
accused.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
judge
vorhees,
when
this
case...
if
this
case
is
returned
to
judge
vorhees,
will
probably
preside
over
a
jury
trial,
i
would
expect,
your
honor,
so
i
don't
think,
and
your
cases
suggest,
clancy,
goldberg,
and
the
like,
that
we
can't
speculate
as
to
what
is
going
to
happen
again.
we
can't
speculate
what
could
have
happened.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
judge
vorhees
made
a
determination
based
upon
what
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
was
an
improper
constitutional
analysis,
and
also
his
factual
basis
was
undermined.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
correct,
that
is
what
he
said,
but
why
did
he
say
that?
judge
vorhees--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--well,
i
believe
it
does,
because
it
goes
to
the
factual
underpinnings
for
his
decision,
the
facts
which
you
must
analyze
now
when
you
are
independently
reviewing
the
constitutional
basis
for
his
decision.
judge
vorhees
indicated
that,
i
make
this
finding
because
the
testimony
of
these
agents
as
it
regarded
the
drug
counts
was
largely
exculpatory.
that
simply
wasn't
the
case.
and
in
fact
his
verdict
belies
that.
in
reality,
and
contrary
to
what
government
counsel
has
indicated,
what
happened
here,
these
two
witnesses
were
key
not
only
in
the
proclamation
of
the
entirety
of
the
government's
case,
but
they
were
the
only
witnesses
produced
by
the
government
on
the
drug
count.
they
were
key--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--the
government...
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
excuse
me,
your
honor.
the
government
presented
no
other
evidence
except
for
these
witnesses
as
relates
to
the
drug
counts.
these
witnesses...
and
i
think
that
it
is
important
when
reviewing
your
cases
as
to
whether
this
information
is
material,
chief
justice--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--as
to
the
nine
counts
that
were
reduced
down
to
simple
possession,
there
was
contradictory
evidence
to
the
agents
in
the
record.
as
to
the
two
delivery
counts,
there
was
testimony
from
the
defendant
himself
at
trial,
but
there
was
no
other
evidence
which
was
produced
by
the
government.
the
defendant
himself
took
the
stand
and
acknowledged
that
he
had
made
deliveries,
but
that
they
were
not
of
the
sort
contemplated
or
charged
by
the
government
in
its
indictment.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
of
controlled
substances,
prescribed,
controlled
substances,
his
own
controlled,
prescribed...
prescribed,
controlled
substances.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
his
testimony
was
that
he
did
not
make
the
deliveries
as
urged
by
the
prosecution
in
the
case,
but
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
prescribed
drugs
himself
that
he
had
given
to
individuals
in
the
past,
including
these
two
agents.
but
his
testimony
was
in
contradiction
to
the
facts
that
they
attempted
to
present
to
the
court
in--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--the
defendant's
testimony?
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
the
government's
testimony,
of
course,
came
first,
and
our
argument
here
is
that
the
defendant
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
prepare
a
defense
which
contemplated
effectively
cross
examining
these
individuals
in
anticipation
of
discrediting
them.
the
reason
they
didn't
do
that,
of
course,
was
because
the
government
failed
to
disclose
information
that
they
had
a
right
to.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
order
to
answer
that
question,
you
have
to
presume
that
the
error
which
occurred
did
not
constitutionally
impact
the
defendant's
rights.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
i
think
the
simple
answer
to
that
is,
i
am
not
entirely
certain.
if
the
exact
drugs
which
were
charged
in
the
indictment
were
the
ones
which
he
testified
to
delivering,
i
think
that
you
are
correct,
but
of
course
the
defendant
ought
not
to
be
put
in
that
position
of
having
to...
i
think
what
the
government
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
here.
what
we
are
trying
to
argue--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--well,
he
did,
but
the
strategy
employed
there
was,
there
was
a
need
to
confront
the
credibility
of
these
witnesses.
they
had
not
any
opportunity
to
do
that
pretrial
or
during
trial,
during
cross
examination
because
of
the
denial
of
the
existence
of
promises
made
to
these
witnesses.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
that
is
entirely
possible,
your
honor,
and
again,
what
your
teachings
have
been,
this
court's
teachings
are
that
we
cannot
speculate
as
to
what
might
have
happened.
what
we
are
required
to
do
here
is
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
error,
to
analyze
the
character
of
the
evidence
to
determine
whether
its
non-disclosure
may
have
impacted
a
constitutional
right.
the
constitutional
right
here
is
the
right
to
cross
examine
on
a
material
witness,
a
key
witness,
and
that
wasn't
accomplished
because
the
government
in
effect
affirmatively
said
that
there
were
no
promises
made
to
these
people
by
handing
over
the
affidavits
which
were
presented,
by
agent
prins's
failure
to
disclose,
and,
we
submit,
willful
withholding
of
those
documents.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
i--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--yes--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--perhaps
i
am
misunderstanding
your
hypothetical.
had
the
court
actually
received
these
documents
in
evidence
at
trial?
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
and
the
court
said,
i
appreciate
the
impeachment
effort
concerning
these
witnesses,
i
find
their
testimony
compelling
nonetheless.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
i
think
that
we
would
have
a
hard
time
arguing
that
that
case
ought
to
be
reversed,
because
we
would
be
arguing
that
the
factual
basis
for
the
court's
decision
was
improper,
and
of
course
the
court--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--well,
if
there
were
a
factual
basis.
what
i
am
admitting
is
that
if
there
were
facts
which
supported
a
finding
of
guilt--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
then
we
would
be
arguing
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
court
was
in
error
in
reaching
the
decision
it
did,
and
we
would
have
a
difficult
time
doing
that,
your
honor.
but
that
isn't
the
issue
here,
and
that
is
why
judge
vorhees's
analysis
was
incorrect.
he
did
not
perceive
the
constitutional
significance
of
analyzing
impeachment
material
pretrial
to
determine
what
strategy
the
case
may
take.
judge
vorhees
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
this
court's
decisions
in
strickland
and
cronic,
which
came
more
recently
outlining
what
effective
counsel
really
is,
and
justice
o'connor
in
her
decision
said,
what
we
are
looking
to
within
the
sixth
amendment
context
is
whether
we
can
have
justifiable
reliance
upon
the
outcome.
and
what
that
means
in
justice
stevens's
opinion
in
cronic
was,
a
lawyer
who
is
going
to
truly
test
the
adversarial
process
of
the
trial
court
proceeding,
and
the
way
that
you
do
that
is
through
cross-examination,
of
course,
and
justice
stevens
then
alluded
to
the
davis
decision,
which
indicates
that
this
type
of
information,
the
ability
to
cross-examine
a
government
witness
with
impeaching
information,
is
of
the
most
important
kind
of
information
when
analyzing
that
effective
cross
examination
question,
and
that
failure
to
disclose
it
or
to
provide
it
or
to
limit
is
constitutional
error
of
the
first
magnitude,
and
that
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
we
never
got
to
the
point
where
we
could
involve
ourselves
in
that
very
necessary
constitutional
right
to
effective
cross
examination
of
these
witnesses.
entire
trial
strategies
were
affected,
and
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
her
opinion
in
strickland,
ineffectiveness,
or
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
includes
the
ability
of
counsel
to
make
independent
decisions
about
how
to
conduct
a
defense.
we
had
a
jury
waiver
in
this
case.
we
had
no
cross
examination
of
the
key
government
witnesses.
we
don't
know
what
would
have
happened,
and
clancy
and
goldberg
and
your
other
teachings
suggest
we
should
not
speculate
as
to
what
might
have
happened,
but
rather
we
look
at
the
character
of
the
evidence
which
was
withheld,
determined
whether
it
was
in
fact
of
such
magnitude
that
it
impacted
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendants,
and
if
it
does,
then
you
are
going
to
reverse
under
the
harmless
error
doctrine.
and
if
there
is
government
interference
in
that
process,
actual
government
obstruction,
then
it
is
presumptive
error,
and
we
submit,
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
this
case
that
the
government's
failure
to
disclose
and
their
affirmations
that
these
witnesses
had
had
no
promises
concerning
rewards,
it
was
tantamount
to
government
interference
with
the
ability
of
counsel
to
conduct
his
defense.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
your
honor,
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
that
holding
is
effectively
dicta,
and
i
don't
believe
i
am
any
happier
with
it
than
the
solicitor
general
is.
i
expect
had
it
not
been
there,
perhaps
we
wouldn't
be
here.
but
the
effect
of
that
language,
of
course,
has
to
be
dealt
with,
but
what
you
look
to
in
the
decision
is
whether
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
analyzed
the
materiality,
and
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
in
reaching
its
decision
alluded
to
brady,
to
agurs,
the
standard
set
forth
in
agurs,
and
to
davis,
and
the
court
of
appeals
then
said,
looking
at
brady,
the
mandate
of
disclosure,
and
looking
at
agurs,
which
says
a
failure
will
seldom,
if
ever,
be
excusable
where
there
is
a
specific
request,
and
this
is
a
specific
request
case,
and
if
it
impacts
a
cross
examination
right,
such
as
in
davis,
then
we
are
going
to
talk
about
reversal.
i
think
that
the
decision
needs
clarity,
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
function
of
you
at
this
point,
is
to
add
some
clarity
to
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
that
is
not
necessary,
your
honor.
i
think
what
is
necessary
is
to
say
that
the
language
is
improvident
within
the
context
of
this
decision,
and
that
in
looking
at
giglio,
there
is
a
requirement
of
materiality
in
non-disclosure
cases,
but
in
this
case
there
was
materiality,
so
the
result
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct,
but
this
does
not
mean
that
there
is
an
automatic
reversal
rule
that
each
case
has
to
be
analyzed
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
and
that
instruction
should
be
sent
forward
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
to
summarize,
the
constitutional
basis
for
our
argument
is,
the
government
here
did
fail
to
disclose
information
as
mandated
by
brady.
the
failure
was
to
a
specific
request,
and
under
agurs,
those
sorts
of
failures
are
seldom,
if
ever,
excusable.
when
looking
at
the
character
of
the
evidence,
as
urged
in
the
agurs
decision,
we
find
that
it
involved
impeaching
information
of
critical
importance.
to
answer
your
question,
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
our
opinion
that
giglio
did
decide
that
impeaching
information
fell
within
the
purview
of
brady,
that
is,
that
it
is
favorable
information,
that
is
information
that
must
be
presented
to
the
accused
within
the
mandate
of
brady.
and
of
course
davis,
napue,
giglio,
and
brady
all
talked
about
the
importance
of
impeaching
information.
the
character
of
that
evidence
is
manifestly
important
to
the
accused.
we
look
to
the
counsel's
effective
assistance
through
cross
examination
as
mandated
by
davis,
strickland,
and
cronic,
and
we
find
that
there
was
no
cross
examination.
in
fact,
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
no
cross
examination
in
this
case,
and
that
is
apparent.
we
rely
upon
the
statements
of
the
government
in
this
case.
and
that
brings
us
to
the
practicalities.
we
are
dealing
in
the
federal
criminal
discovery
process,
and
as
indicated
in
agurs,
it
is
not
perfect.
there
is
not
full
disclosure,
and
we
are
going
to
have
problems
like
this
from
time
to
time.
defense
counsel
in
these
situations
is
singularly
reliant
upon
the
forthrightness
of
the
prosecutor
in
responding
to
government...
or
to
discovery
requests.
we
have
no
capability
to
look
into
their
file.
here,
where
we
ask
for
promises
of
reward
or
remuneration
for
any
kinds
of
representations
or
inducements
made
to
any
witnesses,
anything
which
might
shed
light
on
his
reliability.
then
i
agree
that
the
prosecutor
was
charged
with
going
to
his
agent
and
saying,
hey,
have
you
promised
this
guy
anything?
is
there
anything
that
we
have
got
to
let
the
defense
counsel
know
which
may
impact
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case?
well,
the
response
to
that
in
our
case
was
to
produce
affidavits
which
clearly
suggested
to
the
contrary.
as
a
result,
cross
examination
was
limited
effectively
and
materially,
and
the
constitutional
rights
of
this
defendant,
we
submit,
were
impermissibly
infringed.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
there
was
the
ability
to
cross
examine
the
agents
as
to
the
factual
basis
for
their
conclusions.
there
was
no
ability
to
cross
examine
as
to
their
bias,
their
motive,
their
expectation
of
remuneration.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
because
there
was
an
affirmative
representation
by
the
government
that
they
had
had
no
promises
for
payment.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
your
honor,
you
are
shooting
in
the
dark
when
you
are
doing
that.
if
the
government--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--i
suspect
you
are
correct,
chief
justice,
but
in
this
case
we
have
had
a
representation
from
the
government
that
nothing
had
been
made.
it
certainly
is
not
a
failing
on
counsel's
part
to
not
have
asked
that
question,
and
if
they
had
asked
that
question,
we
don't
know
what
the
answer
would
have
been,
and
again,
goldberg
and
clancy
suggest
that
we
don't
speculate.
as
justice
brennan
was
discussing
earlier--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--well,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
that
is
the
way
it
is
done.
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--well,
i
think--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--in
the
federal
court
we
rely
upon
the
federal
prosecutor,
and
when
he
said
he
wasn't
paid,
we
accepted
that
response,
to
our
detriment,
and
as
indicated
in
barbie,
we
don't
even
know
if
the
u.s.
attorney
knew.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
the
adversary
process
does
not
require
that
an
attorney
ask
every
question
if
the
question
does
not
appear
to
be
relevant
or
that
a
response
will
not
be
favorable
to
the
accused.
if
i
ask
somebody
if
he
is
being
paid
expecting
that
he
is
going
to
say
no,
then
i
am
asking
the
wrong
question,
and
i
am
hurting
my
client
because
i
am
reinforcing
the
credibility
of
that
agent.
and
even
more
so,
in
this
case
can
you
imagine
the
possibilities
with
the
cross
examination.
here
we
have
an
affidavit
executed
on
may
4
saying
i'm
not
promising
anything,
and
on
may
3rd
we
have
an
affidavit,
a
contract
for
purchase
of
information.
why,
if
that
had
been
turned
over,
the
possibilities
for
effective
cross
examination
are
immense,
and
it
is
particularly
immense
because
there
was
no
monetary
amount--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--well,
the
affidavits
would
have
had
to
have
been
produced
under
jencks,
because
they
were
statements
of
the
accused,
or
of
the
witnesses,
so
the
possibilities
for
cross
examination,
as
i
have
indicated,
are
tremendous,
and
they
are
even
more
tremendous
because
there
was
no
actual
amount
set
forth,
so
we
are
dealing
with
a
person
who
is
testifying
and
hopes
to
get
the
most
amount
he
can
possibly
get.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
it
is
the
chapman
standard.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
because
we
are
dealing
with...
agurs
simply
states
that
when
you
deal
with
constitutional
error,
then
you
analyze
it
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
agurs
states...
agurs
does
not--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--it
is
a
constitutional
harmless
error
standard.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
the
agurs
standard
which
you
have
just--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--that
is
the
non-constitutional
agurs
standard
which
applies
in
general
or
unspecific,
or
general
or
no
request
situations.
agurs
states--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--agurs
states
where
there
has
been
a
specific
request,
then
these
kinds
of
situations
will
seldom
if
ever
be
excusable,
and
if
there
is
a
possibility
that
it
might--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--agurs
went
on
to
indicate
that
if
it
might
have
affected
the
jury's
verdict,
then
it
is
reversible
error
under
the
strict
disclosure
standard.
that
is
what
agur
said.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think
in
constitutional
error
cases,
first
of
all,
the
prosecutor
bears
the
burden
of
indicating
that
it
was
harmless.
in
the
opposite,
in
the
non-constitutional
situation--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--within
the
context...
ours
is
a
constitutional
error,
your
honor,
because
there
was
a
failure
to
provide
specifically
requested
evidence.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
yes.
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
analysis
of
that
kind
of
error
is
a
non-constitutional
analysis.
it
becomes
constitutional
error
if
the
defendant
is
able
to
meet
his
burden
of
persuasion
in
that
case
of
showing
that
notwithstanding
the
non-constitutional
nature
of
the
disclosure
in
this
case,
the
failure
to
disclose,
and
it
is
non-constitutional
because
there
is
no
specific
request,
or
the
prosecutor
wasn't
put
in
a
position
where
he
had
to
respond,
or
the
prosecutor
responded
dishonestly,
then
the
defense
bears
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
interrupted
the
fair
trial
process
of
that
particular
case.
then
it
elevates
to
the
constitutional...
then
it
is
constitutional
error,
but
the
analysis,
the
standard
of
review
is
different.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be,
because
strickland
was
referring
to
the
non-constitutional
error
aspect
of
the
agurs
decision.
it
is
our
position...
and
agurs
indicated
that
to
determine
whether
it
is
constitutional
or
non-constitutional,
you
look
to
the
character
of
the
evidence.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
your
honor,
in
order
to
get
here,
of
course,
we
have
to
urge
that
there
is
constitutional
error,
but
in
reaching
the
determination
of
whether
there
was
constitutional
error,
there
are
various
standards
which
apply.
when
there
is
a
head-on
collision
with
a
constitutional
right,
such
as
in
gideon
where
you
say
no
lawyer
at
all,
then
that
is
presumed,
and
you
have
that
collision.
there
are
other
types
of
error
which
result
from
a
non-constitutional
basis,
such
as
the
failure
to
disclose
in
the
agurs
situation,
which
then
require
a
different
standard
of
review
from
the
court
to
determine
whether--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--sure.
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
true.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
your
honor,
under
that
hypothetical,
we
would
have
difficulty,
but
that
is...
that
presumes
that
there
was
not
the
constitutional
violation,
the
confrontation
which
existed--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--well,
i
guess--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--i
think
that
again
the
counsel
always
has
a
difficult
time
assailing
the
verdict
of
a
trier
of
fact.
what
we
are
alleging,
however,
is
a
constitutional
impediment
which
affected
that
burden,
and
that
is
why--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--i
understand
that,
your
honor.
and
in
response
to
your
question,
of
course,
absent
constitutional
error,
if
a
jury
returns
a
verdict
based
upon
evidence
presented,
we
are
going
to
have
a
difficult
time
arguing
to
a
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
absence
of
a
constitutional
error
which
affected
that
decision,
then
we
would--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--i
understand
that,
and
in
response
to
your
hypothetical--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
thank
you.
