mr.
strauss,
may
i
interrupt?
you
refer
to
these
as
form
contracts.
they
do
have
some
typed
information
in
them
that
i
gather
is
tailor-made
for
the
particular...
for
mr.
bagley.
was
that
not
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
even
the
name
mitchell?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
language
that
he
will
provide
information
regarding
t1
and
other
violations
committed
by
hughes
a.
bagley
and
so
forth,
that
was
typed
in
after
the
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
and
it
is
based
on...
whose
testimony
was
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
notice
it
is
signed
by
three
officers
of
atf,
and
they
all
signed
after
the
trial,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
statements
were
clearly
false
when
they
said
they
were
free
of
promise
of
reward,
because
there
is
a
promise
of
reward
in
these
form
contracts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
form
document
says,
the
united
states
will
pay
to
said
vendor
a
sum
commensurate
with
services
and
information
rendered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
gave
that
testimony
before
the
magistrate,
not
before
the
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
never
said
that
to
the
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
judge's
decision
did
not
involve
in
any
sense
reviewing
his
own
prior
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
say
that?
he
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
his
own
prior
judgment
would
not
have
been
different
based
entirely
on
the
prior
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
involved
a
complete
review
of
the
prior
judgment,
did
it
not?
is
that
not
your
whole
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
could
he
have
said
he
would
have
made
the
same
decision
without
knowing
what
he
decided
in
the
first
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
just
one
other
question.
in
response
to
justice
white,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
this
was
not
brady
material
that
there
was
any
obligation
to
produce.
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
plus
expenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question,
mr.
strauss,
on
this
question
of
whether
it
was
a
general
request
or
a
specific
request?
you
mentioned
the
eleven
different
requests.
actually,
i
guess
it
is
eleven
paragraphs
in
one
request
for
information.
and
the
eleventh
paragraph
said,
"all
information
which
would
establish
the
reliability
of
the
milwaukee
railroad
employees
in
this
case
whose
testimony
formed
the
basis
for
the
search
warrant.
"
are
they
the
same
two
employees?
justice
stevens
and
so
wouldn't
this
have
also
been
responsive
to
that
paragraph?
justice
stevens
the
reason
i
raised
it,
it
seems
to
me
this
may
be
relevant
to
the
specificity
of
the
request,
whether
it
is
covered
by
more
than
one
paragraph.
justice
stevens
i
realize
that,
but
i
don't
know
why.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
factual
question?
you
did
mention
a
unique
identifying
number
was
on
the
contract
when
signed.
i
notice
that
the
number
is
490,803,000,000
and
some
more,
which
indicates
there
probably
have
been
quite
a
few
of
these
forms
executed
over
the
years.
justice
stevens

justice
john
paul
stevens
would
this
not
be
a
standard
thing
that
a
prosecutor
would
inquire
about
if
there
are
that
many
of
them
floating
around?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
know
how
many
people
you
have
at
$300
apiece
providing
information.
there
could
be
a
lot
of
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question,
mr.
hillier,
there?
it
is
true,
however,
is
it
not,
that
the
affidavits
that
were
made
available
to
you
made
it
clear
that
these
two
men
were
cooperating
with
the
government
in
an
undercover
capacity,
even
though
they
didn't
know
they
got
specific
payment
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
was
some
material
that
could
have
been
used
for
cross
examination
purposes,
even
though
they
could
not
have
made
this
particular--
justice
john
paul
stevens
weren't
there
two
groups
of
drug
charges,
and
weren't
their
testimony
important
on
the
ones
he
went
to
jail
on?
