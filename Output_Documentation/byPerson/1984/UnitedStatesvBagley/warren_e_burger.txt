chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
united
states
against
bagley.
mr.
strauss,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
but
was
he--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--when
the
case
was
tried
before
the
court
without
a
jury,
was
any
of
this
information
before
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
and
that
is
the
only
issue
in
the
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
this
was
in
effect
something
newly
discovered.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
making
the
judgment
he
made,
judge
vorhees
did
not
have
to
review
any
judgment
or
decision
he
had
previously
made
on
the
issue
involved
here,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
was
that?
was
that
at
the
time
of
the
original
trial
or
at
the
habeas
proceeding
years
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
five
or
six
years
later.
chief
justice
burger
did
this
material
relate
to
the
narcotics
charge
or
the
firearms
charge?
chief
justice
burger
and
they
were
acquitted
on
that
charge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hillier.
chief
justice
burger
deliveries
of
what?
chief
justice
burger
what
was
his
testimony
again?
chief
justice
burger
was
that
cumulative
testimony
or
otherwise?
chief
justice
burger
no,
the
government's
testimony.
was
it
cumulative?
chief
justice
burger
would
his
own
admissions
and
his
own
testimony
be
sufficient
to
support
judge
vorhees'
decision?
chief
justice
burger
well,
no,
that
is
going
around
in
a
circle.
i
am
asking
you
a
very
simple
question.
i
will
start
over.
if
the
only
testimony
before
the
court
was
the
testimony
that
the
defendant
himself
gave,
would
it
support
a
guilty
decision?
chief
justice
burger
he
testified
voluntarily,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
if
they
had...
if
the
defense
had
been
able
to
have
this
material
so
as
to
challenge
the
credibility
of
the
two
government
witnesses,
that
then
he
might
not
have
taken
the
stand
and
disclosed
his
guilt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
have
your
position
clear.
if
in
the
prosecution
the
only
evidence
from
whatever
source
was
the
same
evidence
that
this
man,
the
defendant,
gave
on
the
stand,
testifying
in
his
own
behalf,
and
a
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty,
would
that
verdict
have
been
assailable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
presumes
nothing.
i
have
put
a
simple
hypothetical
here.
the
only
evidence
is
the
evidence
that
he
gave,
whether
from
his
mouth
or
from
others,
and
the
jury
accepted
that
and
found
and
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
do
you
think
there
would
be
anything
really
wrong
with
that
verdict?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
legal
sense.
would
it
be
assailable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
in
my
hypothetical.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
take
the
same
hypothetical,
but
not
a
jury,
a
judge
makes
that
finding.
he
could
not
be
reversed
unless
it
were
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
my
hypothetical
there
is
no
constitutional
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
pure
factual
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
strauss?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
