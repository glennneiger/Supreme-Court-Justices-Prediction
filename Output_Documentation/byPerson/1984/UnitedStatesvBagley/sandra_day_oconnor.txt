justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
strauss,
it
is
your
position
that
the
request
of
the
defense
counsel
when
requesting
prior
criminal
records
of
witnesses
to
be
called
by
the
government
and
any
deals,
promises,
or
inducements
made
to
the
witnesses
simply
didn't
cover
the
document
that
had
been
given
to
the
witnesses
to
sign?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
a
pretty
fine
line
you
are
trying
to
draw,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
didn't
the
government
furnish
these
documents?
these
weren't
things
that
the
witnesses
made
up
on
their
own.
presumably
the
government
investigator
handed
them
to
them
and
said,
here,
sign
this,
and
at
the
appropriate
time
we
will
consider
making
a
payment,
or
something
of
that
sort.
isn't
that
what
happened?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
other
evidence
other
than
the
testimony
of
these
two
witnesses
that
would
have
established--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
defendant's
guilt
on
the
drug
counts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
there
were
no
statements
or
confessions
or
admissions
by
the
defendants
themselves
that
were
in
evidence
relating
to
the
drug
counts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
hillier,
even
in
strickland,
which
involved
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
the
standard
applied
was
the
agurs
standard
of
establishing
a
reasonable
probability
that
but
for
the
error,
the
result
would
have
been
different,
and
i
wonder
if
that
isn't
the
appropriate
standard
here
if
you
are
correct
that
there
was
an
error.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
after
you
meet
the
standard,
then
you
know
whether
there
has
been
a
constitutional
error
or
not.
you
don't
get
here
assuming
there
is
a
constitutional
error.
you
allege
there
is
one,
but
you
apply
the
standard
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
evidence
supporting
the
drug
charges
other
than
the
testimony
of
the
two
witnesses
at
issue
here
consisted
of
testimony
of
the
defendant
himself
by
way
of
some
admissions,
and
physical
evidence
obtained
in
a
search
of
his
residence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
agurs-strickland
test
or
standard
is
the
appropriate
one
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
brief
was
a
little
vague
that
the
government
filed,
and
i
didn't
understand
what
the
government
thought.
