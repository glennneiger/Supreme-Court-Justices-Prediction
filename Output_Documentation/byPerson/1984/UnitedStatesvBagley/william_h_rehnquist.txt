justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
strauss,
the
government
here
doesn't
challenge
the
application
of
the
brady
doctrine
to
purely
impeaching
materials,
i
take
it.
justice
rehnquist
and
this
case
is
one
of
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
is
it
that
requires
the
government
to
turn
over
statements
that
are
merely
impeaching
as
opposed
to
exculpatory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hillier,
it
seems
to
me
another
fact
you
have
got
to
contend
with
since
you
are
stressing
the
facts
is
that
we
are
not
here
just
judging
the
conduct
of
some
particular
government
witness.
we
have
a
habeas
proceeding
in
which
judge
vorhees
after
this
bench
trial
that
you
are
just
describing
had
all
the
information
that
was
apparently
withheld
and
said
it
just
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
to
him.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
to
judge
vorhees,
go
ahead
and
try
this
case
again.
that
just
seems
like
a
lot
of
beating
around
the
mulberry
bush.
judge
vorhees
is
going
to
come
out
the
same
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
we
can
speculate
as
to
whether
this
error
that
you
see
would
have
had
any
effect
on
judge
vorhees'
deliberation
in
this
case,
and
i
would
think
he
is
a
pretty
good
witness
for
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
does
say,
this
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
to
me
in
trying
the
case.
you
can
refine
the
constitutional
arguments
all
the
way
you
want,
but
that
really
has
some
import
in
this
case.
the
judge
who
tried
it
in
a
bench
trial
says,
if
i
had
known
all
that
you
now
tell
me,
i
still
would
have
come
out
the
same
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
make
any
difference
why
he
said
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
strickland
was
a
state
case.
how
could
it
be
referring
to
some
non-constitutional
standard?
