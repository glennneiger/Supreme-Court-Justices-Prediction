mr.
henry
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case.
the
first
deals
with
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
with
regard
to
the
use
by
a
police
officer
of
all
necessary
means
to
effect
an
arrest.
the
second
is
whether
the
municipality's
use
of
deadly
force
to
apprehend
a
fleeing
burglary
suspect
after
exhausting
all
other
reasonable
means
is
constitutionally
permissible.
the
reason
the
city
asked
for
certiorari
in
this
case
is
that
it
has
a
substantial
public
interest
in
being
able
to
apprehend
persons
fleeing
from
serious
crimes
such
as
burglary
in
the
first
degree.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
such
that
they
lend
themselves
to
show
that
the
officer
involved
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
felony
had
been
committed.
on
the
evening
of
october
3rd,
1974,
the
police
received
a
call
to
come
to
the
scene
of
what
was
an
apparent
breaking
and
entering.
the
police
arrived
on
the
scene.
they
were
advised
by
the
next-door
neighbor
that
"they
are
breaking
in
next
door.
"
the
officer
then
proceeds
to
survey
the
situation
and
then
to
move
into
the
area
where
the
reported
burglary
was
taking
place.
the
officer
goes
down
the
side
of
the
house,
and
as
doing
so,
notices
as
he
comes
to
the
rear
of
the
house
that
there
was
a
window
that
had
been
broken,
and
a
garbage
can
beneath
the
window,
which
appeared
to
him
that
someone
had
used
the
garbage
can
get
up
to
the
window,
had
broken
the
window,
and
then
had
gained
admittance
to
the
home.
this
all
took
place
at
approximately
11:00
o'clock
in
the
evening.
the
officer
then,
as
he
reaches
the
back
of
the
house,
sees
an
individual
exiting
from
the
house
and
running
toward
the
back
of
the
yard.
there
was
a
lot
of
clutter
in
the
yard
at
the
time.
there
was
a
small
mesh
fence
that
was
an
obstacle
to
the
police
officer
as
he
started
to
move
into
the
back
yard.
there
was
a
chain
link
fence
in
the
back
of
the
yard
which
was
approximately
six
feet
tall.
the
suspect,
after
exiting
the
back
door,
immediately
proceeds
to
the
fence,
and
then
pauses
at
the
fence
in
a
stooped
position.
the
officer
gives
the
command
to
halt,
police.
at
this
point,
the
individual
turns
and
looks
in
the
direction
of
the
police
officer,
and
does
remain
in
this
stooped
position
momentarily,
and
then
as
the
officer
is
about
to
make
his
advance
forward
to
attempt
to
apprehend
the
individual,
he
then
begins
to
jump
and
vault
over
the
fence,
at
which
time
the
officer
fires,
and
unfortunately
it
results
in
the
death
of
the
suspect.
now,
these
basically
are
the
facts
that
are
involved,
and
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
there
can
be
little
or
any
question
that
at
the
time
the
officer
arrived
on
the
scene,
there
was
probable
cause
if
not
more
to
believe
that
a
burglary
in
the
first
degree
had
been
committed.
burglary
in
the
first
degree
under
tennessee
law
is
the
breaking
and
entering
in
a
dwelling
place
in
the
nighttime
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony,
and
the
tennessee
legislature
has
determined
that
burglary
is
a
serious
crime,
which,
if
nothing
more,
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
it
carries
of
not
less
than
five,
no
more
than
15
years.
the
officer
also
made
the
judgment
or
determination,
as
he
so
testified,
that
he
could
not
apprehend
this
individual
by
any
other
means.
now,
under
tennessee
law,
it
is
clear
that
an
officer
must
use
all
means
available
to
apprehend
a
fleeing
felon,
and
he
is
only
justified
in
using
deadly
force
as
a
last
resort.
this
officer
testified
that
because
of
the
conditions
out
at
the
place,
the
fact
that
it
was
dark,
he
was
unfamiliar
with
the
neighborhood,
and
that
beyond
the
fence
there
was
growth...
i
think
he
described
it
johnson
grass...
which
was
rather
tall,
that
he
knew
that
once
the
individual
got
beyond
the
fence,
there
was
no
chance
for
him
to
apprehend,
and
that's
the
reason
that
he
used
the
deadly
force
to
attempt
to
apprehend.
now,
in
the
court
proceedings
below,
the
district
court
found
in
favor
of
all
defendants.
named
in
the
original
action
was
the
city
of
memphis,
the
individual
officer
who
was
on
the
scene,
and
two
supervisory
personnel.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
was
sent
back
because
in
the
meantime
this
court
had
decided
the
manell
case,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
in
light
of
manell
to
further
consider
whether
there
was
any
liability
on
the
part
of
the
city.
the
judgment
as
to
the
individual
defendants
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
case
was
reconsidered
by
the
district
judge,
and
again
the
district
judge
found
that
the
city
was
not
liable,
found
in
favor
of
the
city,
and
the
case
went
up
again.
the
second
time
the
court
declared
that
the
tennessee
statute
allowing
the
use
of
deadly
force
was
unconstitutional.
the
reasons
given
were
that
it
did
not
put
sufficient
limits
on
the
use
of
deadly
force,
it
was
too
disproportionate,
and
it
did
not
make
distinctions
on
the
magnitude
of
the
offenses.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
it
said
it
is
unconstitutional
across
the
board.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
no,
sir,
there
was
no
indication.
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
were
the
two
bases
that
the
court
used
for
declaring
it
unconstitutional.
the
court
said
that
the
use
of
deadly
force
could
only
be
implemented
if
a
suspect
had
committed
a
violent
crime,
if
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
the
suspect
was
armed
or
that
he
would
endanger
the
physical
safety
of
others
if
not
captured.
the
standard
which
the
court
of
appeals
used
was
based
upon
the
model
penal
code.
it
is
the
city's
position
that
the
model
penal
code
was
implemented
to
be
used
as
a
guide
for
legislatures,
and
that
really
the
purpose
of
the
model
penal
code
should
be
as
a
guide
to
legislatures
in
the
event
they
see
fit
to
enact
legislation
to
cover
situations
such
as
this.
the
reasons
the
city
disagreed
with
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
are,
first,
the
city
feels
strongly
that
the
court
erred
in
concluding
that
this
was
not
a
serious
crime.
again,
i
emphasize
and
reiterate,
the
crime
involved
was
burglary
in
the
first
degree.
and
the
court
doesn't
really
deal
with
why
it
considered
the
crime
to
be
nonviolent.
they
did
label
it
as
a
so-called
property
crime.
also,
the
city
feels
that
the
standard
which
was
imposed,
which
was
that
which
is
based
upon
the
model
penal
code,
is
an
impediment
to
apprehension.
because
of
the
standards
placed
under
the
model
penal
code,
it
puts
an
undue
burden
on
law
enforcement
in
situations
such
as
this
in
attempting
to
apprehend
fleeing
felons.
because
of
the
standards
set
out
in
the
model
penal
code,
it
requires
a
police
officer
to
make
an
on
the
spot
constitutional
analysis
and
still
react
to
the
exigencies
of
an
emergency
situation.
because
of
these
standards
set
out
by
the
sixth
circuit,
it
is
difficult
to
determine
how
an
officer
will
ever
know
reasonably
or
otherwise
if
the
felon
is
allowed
to
escape
whether
he
will
ever
again
be
free
to
commit
another
crime
if
not
apprehended.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
not
submitting
to
the
arrest?
mr.
henry
i.
klein
your
honor,
i
might
add
factually
there
was
another
officer
on
the
scene.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
well,
of
course,
he
is
still
in
the
process
of
perpetrating
burglary
in
the
first
degree.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
in
refusing
to
obey
the
officer's
command
to
halt.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
if
your
honor
please,
that
is...
there
is
a
city
ordinance
which
covers
that,
but
it
is
a
very
minor
offense,
and
it
really
would
be
a
city
violation.
it
is
not
a
state
violation.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
no,
sir,
it
is
not
a
state
violation.
of
course--
mr.
henry
i.
klein
--well,
if
they
cannot
apprehend
him
by
any
other
means.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
not
less
than
five
nor
more
than
15
years.
and
if
a
weapon
is
involved,
it
becomes
not
less
than
ten
nor
more
than
14...
or
15
years.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
fifteen,
sir.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
where
a
weapon
is
involved,
not
less
than
ten
nor
more
than
15
years,
if
a
weapon
is
involved,
so
the
tennessee
statute
makes
it
even
a
more
serious
crime
if
a
weapon
is
involved.
the
city
further
contends
that
what
the
sixth
circuit
has
done
is
imposed
a
standard
which
should
be
left
to
the
legislature.
it
is
a
standard
of
morals,
a
standard
of
public
policy,
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
city
that
this
is
something
that
should
be
left
to
the
legislatures.
what
the
court
did
was,
under
the
guise
of
constitutional...
is
imposing
upon
the
various
states
which
would
be
involved
its
own
standards.
furthermore,
the
level
of
crime
which
would
justify
use
of
force
should
also
be
left
to
the
legislature.
tennessee
has
determined
that
burglary
is
a
serious
crime,
and
therefore
it
makes
it
all
the
more
important
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
that
the
right
to
apprehend
is
compelling,
and
is
certainly
a
compelling
state
interest.
the
legislature
has
an
interest
in
protecting
its
citizens
against
burglaries.
of
course,
we
confine
ourselves
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
and
when
we
talk
in
terms
of
compelling
state
interest
as
opposed
to
the
rights
of
the
individual,
the
city
takes
the
position
that
the
individual
burglar
has
no
constitutional
right
to
commit
burglary
and
escape
the
consequences,
and
he
has
no
constitutional
right
to
flee
from
burglary
when
told
to
stop.
and
in
this
particular
situation,
when
the
police
officer
arrived
on
the
scene,
all
the
individual
had
to
do
when
confronted
by
the
officer
and
told
to
stop
was
to
do
so,
and
that
would
have
been
an
end
to
the
situation.
so,
really,
there
are
two
things
that
are
involved
from
the
standpoint
of
the
individual.
he
has
put
himself
in
the
position
by
committing
the
burglary,
which
he
takes
to
do
himself,
and
certainly
assumes
a
certain
risk
of
what
might
happen
when
he
does
put
himself
in
that
position,
and,
then
secondly,
when
told
to
stop,
all
he
has
to
do
is
stop,
and
the
matter
is
at
an
end.
and
all
the
constitutional
rights
that
he
contends
that
were
deprived
of
him
come
into
play.
he
gets
a
fair
trial.
he
gets
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
but
in
this
particular
case
the
individual
chose
to
perpetrate
the
crime
and
chose
to
continue
after
being
told
to
stop.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
your
honor,
what
has
happened
is,
the
city
has
implemented
what
is
known
as
a
general
order.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
no,
sir,
it
is
by
the
city
police
department.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
well,
that's--
mr.
henry
i.
klein
--it
doesn't
say
so,
but
i
might
add
the
courts
in
interpreting
the
state
law,
and
again,
the
state
law
is
really
the
common
law,
and
the
courts
in
interpreting
the
state
law
have
said
even
as
far
back
as
1879
in
the
case
of
reneau
versus
state
that
the
statute
only
intended
that
the
use
of
deadly
force
be
against
what
i
categorize
as
serious
crimes,
and
that
even--
mr.
henry
i.
klein
--well,
serious...
they
didn't
use
the
word
"serious".
what
they
said
in
reneau
versus
state
is
that
if
there
were
certain
crimes
of
lesser
degree,
felonies
of
lesser
degree...
they
talk
in
terms
of
felonies,
but
if
there
were
certain
felonies
of
lesser
degree,
then
there
may
be
some
question.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
state
courts
have
always
interpreted
this
statute
to
apply
to
what
i
would
classify
as
the
more
serious
category.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
well,
my
distinction
of
serious
is
that
it
is
serious,
as
i
indicated,
because
the
legislature
said
it
is
serious.
violent
crimes
are
those
such
as
burglary
in
the
first
degree
which
have
a
great
potentiality
for
violence.
you
may
have
a
burglary
that
may
not
in
fact
involve
violence.
it
may
on
the
other
hand
involve
violence.
for
example,
in
the
case
here,
the
officer,
when
he
arrived
on
the
scene,
didn't
know
what
was
going
on
inside.
there
may
have
been
some
victims
laying
on
the
floor.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
i
can't
say
that
a
dwelling
in
a
deserted
field
would
be
burglary
under
the
tennessee
statute.
at
best
it
would
be
burglary
in
the
third
degree,
which
carries
a
lesser
penalty.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
memphis
policy
would
cover
burglary
in
the
third
degree,
but
again,
the
point
of
this
is
that
burglary
in
and
of
itself,
and
again,
that
is
what
we
had
in
this
case
that
is
before
us
today,
burglary
is
a
serious
offense
with
a
great
potentiality
for
violence.
and
even
though
it
may
not
have
been
a
violent
act
that
was
committed
in
the
example
that
your
honor
gave
with
regard
to
a
dwelling
house
in
a
deserted
field,
the
idea
that
an
individual
who
will
break
and
enter
is
the
type
of
individual
that
has
a
great
propensity
or
likelihood
for
violence,
whether
it
be...
it
may
not
be
at
that
time,
but
it
may
be
in
the
apprehension
of
that
individual,
and
it
is
by
the
nature
of
the
crime,
the
nature
of
the
person
that
perpetrates
such
a
crime
that
it
is
our
position
that
therein
lies
the
great
potentiality
for
violence.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
well,
deadly
force
means
using
that
force,
whether
it
be...
usually
in
the
context
we
think
of
it
it
would
be
a
pistol,
a
firearm.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
well,
when
you
say
deliberately,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
yes,
when
he
pulls
his
weapon,
that
is
what
he
is
intending
to
do.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
no,
it
is
apprehending
him.
that
is
the
purpose.
it
is
the
attempt
to
apprehend,
and
that
is
the
last
resort.
that
is
the
last
thing
he
can
do.
if
it
not
that,
the
perpetrator
is
gone,
and
free
to
commit
a
felony
on
another
day
or
down
the
road.
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
well,
that
is
true,
but
to
be
candid
with
your
honor,
the
police
policy
has
been
to
shoot
for
the
mast.
the
reason--
mr.
henry
i.
klein
--the
mast,
which
is...
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
is
obvious
that
one
who
uses
a
pistol
cannot
be
as
accurate
as,
say,
a
marksman
with
a
rifle
because
of
the
circumstances,
the
fact
that
he
may
be
running
or
he
stops,
and
the
fact
that
a
pistol
is
just
not
an
accurate
weapon.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
that's
correct,
sir.
no
one
can
argue
that
once
you
use
a
firearm,
there
is
always
the
potential
for
killing,
and
it
is
not
that
the
officer
is
intending
to
kill.
he
is
intending
to
apprehend
or
attempting
to
apprehend,
and
that
is
the
only
means
he
has
left
to
do
it.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier
about
whether
or
not
any
states
have
adopted
the
model
penal
code
and
whether
it
proved
satisfactory,
it
is
our
understanding
that
both
idaho
and
new
york
had
adopted
the
model
penal
code,
but
later
idaho
has
reverted
back
to
the
common
law,
which
is
the
same
as
what
tennessee
has,
and
that
new
york
now
has
something
in
between
which
is
referred
to
as
a
forcible
felony
statute.
with
regard
to
the
penalty
that
would
come
into
play
just
for
not
stopping,
and
that
is
true,
that
is...
and
i
think
i
have
pointed
that
out
earlier,
that
is
just
$50
fine,
but
we
again
want
to
emphasize
that
what
is
in
progress
is
a
burglary,
and
that
is
a
continuous
violation
from
the
time
that
there
is
the
breaking
and
entering
which
is
known
to
the
police
officer
through
the
attempt
to
apprehend.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
that
is
correct,
but
he
is
escaping
from
a
serious
crime,
which
is
burglary.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
well,
of
course,
the
point
of
all
of
this,
and
this
gets
back
to
what
states
adopt
what,
really
what
may
be
good
in
idaho
may
not
be
good
in
california,
or
vice
versa,
and
that
is
our
argument
about
these
policy
questions.
not
only
does
it
relate
to
the
state
and
the
legislature,
but
also
to
the
city
of
memphis.
and
that
each
state
has
to
gauge
what
its
particular
problems
are
and
what
policies
it
needs
to
enforce,
and
that
is
our
argument
with
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
henry
i.
klein
that
is
correct.
that
would
be--
mr.
henry
i.
klein
--right.
regardless
of
what
happens
in
the
state,
they
are
all
subject
to
certain
minimal
constitutional
guarantees.
we
have
to
work
within
that
framework,
and
if
a
state
gets
out
of
bounds
or
out
of
whack,
then
they
are
subject
to
those
restrictions.
i
appreciate
the
honor
of
being
able
to
appear
before
the
court.
