mr.
steven
l.
winter
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
start
by
trying
to
address
some
of
the
questions.
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
the
maximum
penalty
for
fleeing
from
an
officer
under
the
memphis
code
is
a
$50
fine,
and
that
is...
the
citation
for
that
is
footnote
31
of
our
brief.
in
reference
to
the
question
about
the
workability
of
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
asked
by
justices
o'connor
and
blackmun
and
justice
powell,
we
would
point
out
that
not
only
do
the
majority
of
the
states
apply
a
rule
consonant
with
the
rule
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
overwhelming
majority
of
municipal
police
departments
in
this
country,
something
at
the
rate
of
75
percent,
apply
a
rule
similar
to
that
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
experience
under
these
statutes
and
under
these
municipal
policies
has
been
investigated.
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
various
police
organizations
in
over
30
individual
police
departments
in
this
country,
from
common
law
and
non-common
law
states
alike,
in
support
of
our
position
in
this
court.
they
recount
the
studies
that
have
been
done
in
these
jurisdictions.
arrest
rates
do
not
go
down.
crime
rates
do
not
go
up.
the
only
thing
that
is
affected
by
a
more
restrictive
deadly
force
policy
is
the
rate
of
officer
safety,
and
the
rate
of
officer
safety
improves
under
these
more
restrictive
policies.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
i
think
the
chief
justice's
question
points
out
one
of
the
problems
with
my
opponent's
position.
that
is,
often
times
there
are
other
means
of
apprehension
short
of
killing
the
fleeing
felon,
eye
witness
identification,
evidence
on
the
scene.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--if
the
officer
can,
certainly.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
well,
if
the
eye
witness
can
identify
him,
then
the
witness
is
of
a
lot
of
assistance.
in
this
particular
case,
the
officer,
when
he
ordered
garner
to
halt,
and
garner
did
halt,
the
officer
was
able
to
see
garner.
now,
it
is
possible
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
make
an
identification
after
the
fact.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
no,
but
the
officer
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
were
any
dead
bodies
in
the
house,
and
i
think
that
is
a
critical
point,
because
one
of
the
major
differences
between
our
position
and
the
position
of
the
city
and
the
state
is
that
they
would
premise
the
right
to
kill
of
a
police
officer
on
what
the
officer
does
not
know.
but
this
court
has
held,
and
i
am
thinking
of
your
honor's
opinion
for
the
court
in
brown
versus
texas,
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
police
actions
to
be
governed
by
what
the
officer
does
know,
specific
objective
facts
indicating
society's
legitimate
interests
that
require
a
seizure
of
the
particular
individual.
the
fourth
amendment
answers
that
question
for
us,
because
it
requires
that
specific
objective
knowledge
on
the
part
of
a
police
officer
before
he
acts.
now,
justice
powell
asked
about
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
the
punishment
for
first
degree
burglary
in
tennessee.
we
would
point
out
that
the
court
ought
to
be
clear
about
the
nature
of
the
underlying
crime
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
if
garner
had
been
guilty
of
first
degree
burglary,
the
punishment
would
have
been
a
maximum
of
15
years.
this
first
degree
burglary
statute
is
the
equivalent
of
the
third
degree
burglary
statute
in
south
dakota
that
the
court
discussed
in
solon
versus
helm.
it
defines
the
exact
same
crime,
with
the
selfsame
punishment
of
15
years.
it
is
not
a
first
degree
burglary
statute
like
many
other
states
such
as
new
york
that
define
first
degree
burglary
as
a
life-endangering
burglary
where
the
burglar
may
be
armed
or
where
harm
results
to
a
victim.
so,
although
it
is
first
degree
as
a
matter
of
tennessee
law,
this
is
not
the
first
degree
crime
defined
by
many
of
the
states,
and
is
equivalent
to
the
third
degree
burglary
that
this
court
has
already
addressed
in
solon.
i
would
point
out
that
the
court
in
solon
versus
helm
recognized
what
is
in
fact
the
case,
that
this
kind
of
third
degree
burglary
is
a
nonviolent
crime.
it
is
a
property
crime,
a
property
crime
listed
under
crimes
against
property
in
the
tennessee
code.
numerous
state
courts
have
observed
what
this
court
observed
in
solon,
that
burglary
is
not
a
violent
crime.
i
am
thinking
of
the
lewis
case
in
florida,
cited
in
our
brief,
as
well
as
the
brown
case
from
alaska,
and
this
is
cited
in
the
city's
reply
brief.
in
brown
the
alaska
supreme
court
held
that
burglary
was
a
serious
crime
against
property,
but
not
per
se
a
violent
crime.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
the
victim
was
15
years
old,
your
honor,
and
the
district
court
found
at
two
places,
and
i
refer
to
a10
in
the
appendix
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
a5,
footnote
3,
that
the
officer
reasonably
believed
that
garner
was
a
juvenile.
the
officer
misjudged
by
two
years.
he
thought
garner
was
17,
possibly
18
years
old.
under
tennessee
law,
he
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
for
burglary.
based
on
the
actual
facts,
at
15
he
absolutely
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
as
a
felon.
he
would
only
have
been
assigned
to
the
juvenile
courts,
and
perhaps
adjudged
delinquent,
which
is
an
expressly
noncriminal
status
under
tennessee
law,
and
ever
under
what
the
officer
reasonably
believed,
that
he
was
17,
it
was
likely
that
he
would
not
be
transferred
to
the
adult
courts
under
the
statutes
in
effect
in
1974,
but
would
have
similarly
been
assigned
only
to
the
juvenile
courts.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
if
he
had
committed
murder,
then
he
could
have
been
treated
as
an
adult
at
that
time,
but
the
tennessee
statute,
which
is
37-234,
specifically
provides
that
juveniles
less
than
16
at
that
time
could
only
be
bound
over
for
violent
crimes,
and
it
specifically
excluded
burglary
as
one
of
those
crimes
for
which
a
15-year-old
could
be
bound
over
to
the
adult
courts.
so,
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
he
could
have
been
treated
as
an
adult
for
murder,
but
not
for
the
burglary
that
he
in
fact
committed.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
correct.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
i
am
not
quite
certain,
your
honor.
i
understand
the
operative
language
can
be
found
at
a44
of
the
appendix,
where
the
court
at
the
outset
of
its
analysis
states,
"the
narrow
question
presented
is
whether
a
state
law
authorizing
the
killing
of
an
unarmed,
nonviolent
fleeing
felon
by
police
in
order
to
prevent
escape
constitutes
an
unreasonable
seizure
of
the
person.
"
mr.
steven
l.
winter
there
are
problems
with
the
court's
formulation,
i
would
agree,
but
i
think
the
essential
import
of
what
the
court
was
saying
is
clear,
and
that
is
that
as
applied
to
these
facts,
certainly,
where
the
officer
testified
that
he
knew
the
juvenile
to
be
unarmed,
that
the
shooting
under
these
circumstances
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
i
would
say
that
this
court
need
go
no
further
than
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
on
these
facts.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
the
other
aspect
i
wanted...
the
court
should
also
be
clear
about
the
facts
that
my
opponents
neglected
to
mention.
that
is
that
the
district
court
in
an
explicit
finding,
which
is
also
found
at
a4
in
the
appendix,
that
when
hyman,
the
officer,
stopped
15-year-old
garner,
"garner
did
not
appear
to
be
armed.
"
and
this
finding
was
based
on
substantial
record
testimony.
the
officer
testified
repeatedly
that
he
had
no
indication
that
garner
was
armed,
that
he
was
reasonably
sure
that
garner
was
unarmed,
and
finally,
on
direct
testimony,
when
asked,
did
you
know
positively
whether
or
not
he
was
armed,
he
answered,
i
assumed
that
he
was
not.
in
our
view,
this
case
presents
really
three
issues
for
the
court
to
determine.
there
is
a
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
and
the
municipal
policy
as
applied
to
this
case,
given
the
facts,
a
nonviolent,
nondangerous
fleeing
property
crime
suspect.
there
is
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
city's
policies
and
customs
that
encourage,
in
fact,
encourage
and
insulate
the
use
of
excessive
force
where
officers
do
not
exhaust
reasonable
alternatives.
and
finally,
the
question
of
whether
the
memphis
policy
is
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
is
racially
discriminatory.
our
position
before
this
court
on
the
first
issue,
that
is,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
clearly
correct
that
a
statute
is
only
narrowly
drawn
to
express
a
legitimate
state
interest
at
stake,
and
is
only
carefully
tailored
to
its
underlying
justification
if
it
permits
the
shooting
when
safety
interests
are
at
stake.
and
the
court
ought
to
be
clear
about
what
is
involved.
this
is
not
a
case
about
shooting
to
wound
or
a
case
about
apprehension
at
all.
the
memphis
policy
is
not
to
shoot
to
wound.
it
is
explicitly
not
so.
it
is
a
policy
of
shooting
to
kill.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
raised
in
both
of
the
courts
below
the
question,
the
narrower
question
of
the
memphis
policy,
and
that
is
a
question
that
i
think
the
court
could
rule
on
without
reaching
the
statute.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
the
court
of
appeals
did
not,
but
the
factual
basis
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
in
a
prior
case
in
wiley
versus
memphis
police
department,
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
memphis
officers
are
taught
to
shoot
to
kill
whenever
they
shoot.
the
testimony
was
based
on...
this
was
based
on
testimony
that
memphis
arms
its
officers
with
dum-dum
bullets,
it
teaches
them
to
shoot
at
the
torso
or
center
mast,
where
viscera
are
more
likely
to
be
hit,
and
death
more
likely
to
ensue,
and
the
officers
understand
their
training
to
be
to
shoot
to
kill.
officer
hyman,
who
fired
in
this
case,
so
testified,
that
he
fired
as
he
was
taught,
at
the
torso,
and
he
shot
to
kill.
the
police
director's
testimony,
director
hubbard,
is
found
at
page
1,500
of
the
record.
it
makes
very
clear
that
there
is
no
shoot
to
wound
policy
in
memphis.
he
says,
"our
officers
simply
have
to
be
trained
so
that
if
the
use
of
a
firearm
is
justified
at
all,
then
the
full
consequences
have
to
be
accepted.
"
"the
likelihood
of
killing
someone
in
that
process
is
very
high.
"
"you
simply
have
to.
"
"it
takes
a
shoot
to
kill
policy.
"
"just
a
shoot
to
wound
policy
is
impractical.
"
so,
this,
we
submit,
is
precisely
the
shoot
to
kill
policy
identified
by
the
chief
justice
in
his
bivens
dissent,
and
recently
discussed
by
the
dissenters
in
los
angeles
versus
lyons.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--it
formulated
more
than
one
standard,
i
am
afraid.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
well,
the
one
that
we
would
urge
on
this
court
is,
i
think,
best
stated
at
page
a51
of
the
appendix.
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
police
can
only
shoot,
and
we
are
talking
about
shooting
to
kill,
when
the
suspect
poses
a
threat
to
the
safety
of
the
officers
or
a
danger
to
the
community
if
left
at
large.
we
submit
that
this
is--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--or
a
danger
to
the
community
if
left
at
large.
we
submit
that
this
is
the
clear
rule.
it
is
rational.
it
is
proportioned
to
the
state's
underlying
interest
and
underlying
justifications.
and
it
is
workable
for
the
police
on
the
beat.
indeed,
we
would
submit
it
is
more
workable
than
the
common
law
rule.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
i
take
it
that
the
police
officer
would
make
this
decision...
we
would
apply
this...
we
would
suggest
that
the
standard
to
be
applied
is
the
standard
enunciated
by
the
chief
justice
for
the
court
in
united
states
versus
cortez,
that
what
a
reasonably
prudent
officer
exercising
his
professional
judgment
based
on
his
training
would
conclude
under
all
circumstances.
if,
for...
the
city
in
its--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--in
this
case...
i
think
this
case--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--that's
right.
if
he
were
armed,
for
example.
if
the
next-door
neighbor--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--certainly
if
the
suspect,
when
told
to
halt,
the
officer
was...
police
officer
refused
to
throw
down
his
weapon--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--if
the
officer
knows
that
he
is
armed--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--if
in
fact
the
person
is
armed
but
he
never
reaches
for
his
weapon,
i
don't
see
where
the
state
interest
in
shooting
to
apprehend--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--when
he
reaches,
i
think
the
officer
is
obviously
entitled
to
and
should
shoot.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
not
until
then.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
i
think
that
may
well
be
a
case.
for
example,
thinking
of
a
year
or
so
ago,
the
tax
evader
in
south
dakota,
gordon
kalb,
who
shot
two
fbi
agents.
the
fbi
were
moving
in
to
arrest
him,
and
he
started
to
run.
i
think
he
was
a
dangerous
individual.
the
police
may
be
justified
in
shooting
in
that
circumstance.
it
depends
on
all
the
circumstances,
and
what
a
reasonably
prudent
officer
would
do
knowing
what
he
knows.
if
the
woman
next
door
who
had
called
in
the
burglary
had
said,
i
heard
screams
next
door,
i
think
the
officer
might
well
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
fleeing
suspect
is
dangerous.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
it
seems
so
intuitively,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
it
is
not
borne
out,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
solon
and
as
other
courts
have
recognized.
the
statistics
we
have
marshalled
in
our
brief
are
very,
very
clear
and
convincing.
92
percent
of
all
burglaries
occur
when
nobody
is
home.
only
8
percent
of
all
burglaries
are
armed
with
guns.
burglaries
result
in
confrontations
between
the
burglar
and
the
victim
only
2.8
percent
of
the
time,
and
half
of
those
never
escalate
beyond
shouting.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
these
statistics
are
based...
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
well,
there
were
several
studies
that
were
done.
i
think
it
was
one
of
them,
the
toronto
study,
that
is
cited
in
our
brief,
was
done
by
going
through
police
records
of
all
reported
burglaries,
and
not
all
arrests.
so
i
think
it
is
not...
and
the
studies
are
all
generally
consistent
in
their
findings
on
the
low
confrontation
rate.
this
is
not
surprising,
because
those
studies
that
have
been
done
that
have
interviewed
the
burglars
have
found
that
the
overwhelming
common
denominator
of
all
burglars
is
that
they
choose
to
burgle
unoccupied
houses,
and
thus
the--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--no,
i
am
not,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
no,
i
do
not
know
those.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
i
would
point
out,
your
honor,
that
the
statistics
for
rates
of
murders
in
residences
and
rates
of
rapes
in
residences
are
extraordinarily
low.
only
2.2
percent
of
all
murders
occur
in
a
residence.
only
6.5
percent
of
all
rapes
occur
in
a
residence
between
strangers.
so,
the
statistical
probability
of
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical
is
very,
very
low,
that
somebody
may
in
fact
have
been
harmed
inside
the
building.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
there
is
no
doubt
that
burglary
is
both
a
serious
crime
and
a
frightening
crime.
indeed,
the
reason
why
burglary
is
punished
severely
in
our
society
is
because
all
of
us
feel
the
sanctity
of
our
home
violated
and
all
of
us
are
very
frightened
by
the
prospect
of
a
stranger
coming
in
at
night.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
burglary
being
treated
as
a
serious
crime
under
state
law
and
lengthy
punishments
being
imposed.
the
only
question
that
we
pose
is
whether
the
state's
interests
in
preventing
escape
because
apprehension
is
not
what
occurs
are
sufficiently
substantial
to
justify
the
taking
of
life.
we
submit
that
it
is
not,
and
that
it
is
not
proportionate
only
unless
the
state's
interests
are
implicated,
and
they
are
not
with
most
burglaries.
now,
if
the
officer
has
some
reasonable
objective
basis
in
fact
to
believe
that
this
particular
burglar
is
dangerous,
that
he
is
armed,
or
if
he
has
information
that
there
was
a
scream
or
a
shot
inside,
to
use
some
of
the
hypotheticals
from
the
city
reply
brief,
i
think
that
is
a
different
case.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
yes,
i
would--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--in
most
instances,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
correct.
it
could
be
dangerous
to
a
police
officer.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
no.
i
mean,
garner
broke
a
window
to
get
into
the
house.
that
would
certainly
not
give
the
officer
probable
cause
to
believe
he
would
assault
an
individual.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
i
must
confess
to
having
not
thought
about
that.
the
policy
of
the
fbi
as
i
understand
it
would
not
be
to
shoot
such
people.
the
fbi
policy
is
one
of
only
shooting
in
defense
of
life.
perhaps
the
state
interest
would
be
substantial
enough.
under
the
rule
that
we
are
suggesting,
it
would
not
apply.
justice
white
asked
about
alternative
readings
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding.
i
take
it
that
the
citation
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
model
penal
code
suggests
that
it
might
have
had
in
mind
rule
slightly
different
that
what
we
are
proposing
here
today.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
correct.
unless
it
was
a
crime
of
sabotage.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
no,
under
the
model
penal
code
rule,
i
take
it
that
the
distinction
drawn,
and
we
think
it
is
a
less
satisfactory
rule,
the
distinction
drawn
is
one
based
on
the
gravity
of
crime.
and
basically
it
is
violence
also.
if
it
is
a
dangerous
crime
and
for
violent
crime
the
gravity
of
the
crime
is
sufficient
to
justify
use
of
deadly
force.
the
state
and
the
city
attack
that
position
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
too
difficult
to
draw
those
kind
of
lines
and
legislatures
should.
i
take
it
that
this
court
has
already
addressed
an
analogous
question
in
the
eighth
amendment
context
in
the
solon
case.
and
in
solon,
the
court
identified
three
objective
factors
that
are
capable
of
judicial
application
to
ascertain
the
gravity
of
a
crime.
the
court
identified
whether
the
crime
is
violent
or
nonviolent,
secondly,
the
magnitude
of
the
offense,
and
third,
the
culpability
of
the
offender.
by
each
of
these
criterion,
the
crime
involved
in
this
case
falls
on
the
less
grave
side.
certainly
this
was
a
nonviolent
crime.
and
as
we
have
demonstrated,
burglary
is
inherently
a
nonviolent
crime.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
we
would
have
certainly
a
more
difficult
case,
but
i
think
the
case
has
to
turn
on
what
the
officer
knows.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
i
think
it
has
to
turn
on
what
the
officer
knows.
the
officer
can't
justify
shooting
after
the
fact.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
he
might
well.
this
officer
testified...
the
facts
of
the
case
are,
when
the
officer
arrived
on
the
scene,
he
went
along
the
side
of
the...
west
side
of
the
house
to
the
back
yard,
which
was
where
he
found
young...
15-year-old
garner.
while
he
was
walking
along
the
side
of
the
house,
he
had
occasion
to
look
into
the
house.
he
saw
the
bedroom
that
had
been
ransacked,
although
i
am
not
sure
if
he
saw
it
had
been
ransacked
at
that
point,
but
he
looked
into
the
house.
when
he
got
to
the
back
yard,
he
saw
that
a
window
had
been
broken
into.
he
saw
the
garbage
can.
he
might
have
reason
to
know
that
something
more
had
occurred
if
it
had.
the
neighbor
might
have
reported,
instead
of
hearing
glass
breaking,
that
she
heard
screams.
any
of
those
would
have
constituted
probable
cause.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
if
the
officer...
the
officer's
action
has
to
be
based
on
what
he
knows
or
has
probable
cause
to
believe,
and
not
on
what
is
found
out
after
the
fact.
just
as
if
the
officer
thought
that
garner
was
armed,
if
he
saw
a
shiny
object,
it
would
have
been
reasonable
for
him
to
shoot,
even
though
it
turned
out
after
the
fact
that
the
shiny
object
wasn't
a
gun.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rule
cuts
both
ways.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
can
they
shoot
the
tires?
mr.
steven
l.
winter
yes.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
no,
but
for
a
different
reason,
your
honor.
the
two
constants
of
almost
every
police
shooting
policy
are
not
to
shoot
at
cars
that
are
moving,
and
not
to
fire
warning
shots.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
and
there
is
a
good
reason,
because
the
people
who
get
hit
are
almost--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--if
the
people
in
the
car
were
armed
and
dangerous,
i
think
no.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
it
seems
to
me
that
the
better
alternative
would
be
to
get
on
the
radio
and
call
other
cars
and
head
them
off.
i
would
note
that
the
policy
in
memphis
is
that
people
who
are
driving
under
the
influence,
who
are
quite
dangerous,
even
though
it
isn't
a
felony--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--get
shot.
they
may
well
be
substantially
more
dangerous
than
people
like
15-year-old
garner.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
yes,
and
i
take
it
"halt,
police"
is
sufficient.
i
mean,
the
officer
neither
here
nor
in
many
other
cases
said
"stop
or
i'll
shoot".
garner
had
no
specific
warning
from
the
officer.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
well,
i
start
from
the
premise
that
the
suspect
should
stop,
but
whether
he
is
waiving
his
constitutional
rights
it
seems
to
me
is
hard
to
say.
i
mean,
i
would
point
out
that
we
are
talking
about
a
15-year-old
who
the
last
time
he
broke
into
a
neighbor's
house
had
been
turned
in
to
the
police
by
his
own
father.
he
was
probably
more
scared
of
being
caught
and
being
turned
over
to
his
father
than
of
the
policeman's
bullet.
also,
on
the
night
of
his
death,
15-year-old
garner
had
had
a
beer
and
was
somewhat
intoxicated,
according
to
the
medical
examiner.
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
the
rule
that
we
would
suggest
as
applied
to
the
case
that
justice
rehnquist
has
hypothesized,
i
think,
is
that
we
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
waiver,
but
your
honor
is
quite
correct.
on
the
facts
of
this
case
as
the
officer
knew
them,
he
was
dealing
with
a
juvenile
who,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
eddings
versus
oklahoma
and
velloti
versus
barrett,
is
less
capable
of
being
responsible,
is
less
capable
of
thinking
of
the
consequences
of
his
or
her
actions,
who
also
is
acting
impulsively,
and
is
less
capable
of
conforming
his
or
her
actions
to
the
law,
all
things
that
this
court
discussed
in
the
eddings
opinion
and
in
the
prior
opinion
in
velotti.
the
officer
knew
that.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
certainly,
and
at
least
as
the
officer
knew
it
to
be,
which
was
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
juvenile.
i
might
point
out
that
under
the--
mr.
steven
l.
winter
--no,
i
don't
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
should
allow
such
a
shooting.
i
think
that
unless
the
state
interests
require
it
because
of
the
interests
of
protecting
the
public,
the
fourth
amendment
would
bar
that
shooting.
the
officer
may
have
other
alternatives.
he
should
run
after
him.
he
should
call
in
assistance.
he
should
investigate
the
scene.
it
does
not
invariably
follow
that
the
person
gets
away
and
he
will
never
be
caught,
although
that
may
often
be
the
consequence,
it
is
not
always
the
consequence.
with
regard
to
both
the
workability
and
the
question
of
the
shooting
in
this
case,
i
would
also
point
out
that
at
least
since
1976
memphis
has
had
a
rule
with
regard
to
the
shooting
of
juveniles
that
is
precisely
the
rule
that
we
urge
in
this
court.
that
is,
under
the
memphis
policy,
only
juveniles
who
are
dangerous
to
life
can
be
shot.
that
was
not
in
effect
in
1974,
but
it
was
adopted...
well,
i
may
be
wrong
on
the
date.
perhaps
1979.
with
regard
to
the
tennessee
statute
and
whether
it
only
covers
serious
crimes
or
nonserious
crimes,
we
would
draw
the
court's
attention
to
page
1,460
in
the
court
of
appeals
record,
which
is
a
listing
of
every
nonviolent
property
crime
suspect
shot
at
by
the
memphis
police
between
1969
and
1975.
this
listing
was
prepared
by
captain
colleta
of
the
memphis
police
department.
it
lists
shootings
for
such
circumstances
as
a
prowler
who
is
stealing
from
a
car
lot.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
well,
we
suggest
that
in
many
instances,
whatever
the
tennessee
law
may
be
on
the
books,
or
as
the
courts
would
construe
them
if
it
got
the
cases,
it
is
not
the
practice
under
either
the
tennessee
law
or
the
memphis
policy
to
restrict
shootings
only
to
serious
and
dangerous
people.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
no,
but
we
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention
because
the
argument
that
the
tennessee
statute
is
somehow
sufficient
to
prevent
these
unconstitutional
shootings
and
that
the
court
need
not
rule
on
the
question
we
suggest
is
just
not
borne
out
by
the
practice
and
the
record.
people
who
have
stolen
checks
have
been
shot
at
by
memphis
police.
these
are
the
petty...
the
pickpockets
and
the
petty
thieves
identified
by
the
chief
justice
in
bivens
which
the
reply
briefs
say,
no,
never
happens
in
tennessee.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
in
this
case,
yes.
both
were
black.
mr.
steven
l.
winter
both
were
black.
but
i
would
point,
your
honor,
to
the
testimony
of
the
police
director
that
he
"had
more
problems
with
his
black
officers
trying
to
out-redneck
his
white
officers.
"
