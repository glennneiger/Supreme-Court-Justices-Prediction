how
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
formulated
the
standard
as
to
when
you
can
shoot
to
kill?
justice
white
or
did
it?
did
it?
justice
white
yes,
i
thought
so.
i
wondered
which
one
you
thought
was
correct,
if
either
one
is.
justice
white
did
you
say
"or"
or
"and"?
justice
white
how
would
you
ever
know
that
alternative
or?
justice
white
in
this
particular
case,
i
suppose
you
would
just
have
to
conclude
that
that
other,
that
alternative
could
just
never
have
been
satisfied.
justice
white
or
in
most
cases.
what
you
would
really
have
to
say
is
that
the
officer
would
have
to
know
or
reasonably
believe
that
the
man
or
lady
was
a
danger
to
the
community.
justice
white
would
being
armed
be
enough
to
satisfy
the
alternative?
justice
white
i
suppose
if
you
have
a
warrant
to
arrest
someone
who
is
known
to
be
dangerous,
and
you
encounter
him,
and
he
runs,
what
about
that?
justice
white
so
you
would
say
violent
crimes
then,
would
you
say
automatically
this
test
that
you
propose
is
satisfied?
justice
white
if
there
is
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
has
just
committed
a
violent
crime?
justice
white
and
that
violent
means
violent...
a
danger
to
a
person,
is
that
it,
or--
justice
white
--it
doesn't
mean
that
he
just
happens
to
use
violence
to
break
into
a
house.
justice
white
have
you
thought
about...
i
suppose
in
carrying
the
case
you
must
have
thought
about
it...
suppose
the
police
want
to
stop
a
car,
and
they
walk
along
side
of
it
and
flash
a
red
light,
and
he
takes
off
at
high
speed,
and
they
chase
him.
justice
white
certainly
armed
with
a
car.
justice
white
can
they
shoot?
justice
white
that
may
be--
justice
white
--that
may
be
so,
but
would
it
be
unconstitutional
under
your
rule?
justice
white
well,
they
are
being
quite
a
danger
to
the
community
by
driving
up
and
down
the
street
at
90
miles
an
hour.
