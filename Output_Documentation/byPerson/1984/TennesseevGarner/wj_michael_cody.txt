mr.
wj
michael
cody
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
considering
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
here,
i
believe
that
there
are
two
overriding
questions
for
the
court.
first,
was
the
court
of
appeals
correct
in
rejecting
the
common
law
rule
and
establishing
as
a
federal
constitutional
mandate
that
deadly
force
may
only
be
used
when
the
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
a
violent
as
distinguished
from
a
nonviolent
crime
has
been
committed.
and
secondly,
is
a
federal
court
under
our
system
of
federalism
the
appropriate
body
to
make
this
ethical
and
moral
public
policy
decision,
or
is
it
more
appropriately
left
to
the
state
legislature
as
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people?
and
we
submit
that
the
answers
to
these
questions
will
turn
on
an
understanding
and
a
recognition
of
the
state's
substantial
interest
in
being
able
to
apprehend
serious
criminals
and
preserve
the
public
safety.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
that
section
40-7-108
of
the
tennessee
code,
which
is
generally
an
embodiment
of
the
common
law
rule
as
it
has
been
construed
over
the
years
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
is
constitutional
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
as
i
have
indicated,
i
think
there
are
serious
considerations
before
the
court.
the
ethical
and
the
moral
judgments
of
public
policy
that
a
society
must
make
are
judgments
we
believe
better
made
in
the
state
legislature
than
in
the
federal
court,
and
the
ability
of
the
state
to
effectively
apprehend
suspects
that
are
fleeing
from
felony
crimes
reflects
a
substantial
interest
on
the
part
of
the
state
and
does
not
amount,
as
has
been
suggested,
to
punishment
of
the
suspect.
and
in
balancing
the
interests
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
that
substantial
state
interest
in
apprehending
criminal
suspects
measured
against
the
right
of
the
criminal,
who
can
lawfully
submit
to
arrest
and
possibly
lose
his
liberty,
because
if
he
submits
to
arrest,
he
may
in
all
probability
for
a
felony
go
today
to
jail,
so
he
loses
some
of
his
liberty
and
freedom,
or
to
disregard
the
lawful
order
of
the
police
and
risk
the
possible
losing
of
his
life
if
in
the
apprehension
process
the
force
that
was
used
was
deadly
force.
these
questions,
we
believe,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
will
allow
this
court
to
recognize
that
the
felon
should
not
have
a
right
to
unwarranted
protection
from
apprehension
which
would
jeopardize
the
public
security
in
not
being
able
to
bring
a
criminal
to
justice.
it
is
the
apprehension
process
that
is
necessary
before
any
of
the
other
criminal
justice
procedures
can
come
into
play,
and
unless
the
state
is
able
to
recognize
and
to
implement
its
substantial
interest
in
arresting
and
apprehending
felonies,
then
the
state
has
lost
forever
its
ability
to
do
that.
and
the
rule
which
would
allow
a
fleeing
felon
to
disregard
the
fact
and
to
say
that
the
police
have
no
threat
or
no
ability
to
use
maximum
force
if
necessary
will
encourage
in
property
crimes
or
burglary
crimes
as
we
have
here,
will
encourage
the
criminal
to
run
each
time.
if
there
is
a
person
helping
him
who
merely
looks
out
for
the
police,
all
that
has
to
be
said
is,
here
come
the
police,
and
they
know
that
the
police
cannot
use
all
necessary
force
to
apprehend
them,
and
it
becomes
basically
a
foot
race.
the
court
of
appeals
drew
the
line
in
its
setting
up,
we
think,
of
a
constitutional
mandate
based
on
a
model
penal
code
rule
which
is
at
variance
with
at
least
half
of
the
state
rules
between
violent
and
nonviolent
felonies.
we
believe
that
there
are
other
indicators
of
the
state's
substantial
interest
in
apprehending
criminals
other
than
violence.
and
if
the
court
will
allow
me,
i
would
like
to
leave--
mr.
wj
michael
cody
--that
is
true.
mr.
wj
michael
cody
i
suspect
that
would
depend
upon
that
legislature's
analysis
of
how
it
has
worked.
the
point
that
we
have
tried
to
make
in
our
brief
is
that
if
a
police
department
or
a
city
or
a
legislature
makes
a
rule
which
is
more
restrictive
or
like
the
court
of
appeals
rule,
then
it
is
just
that.
it
is
a
rule
that
the
police
department
or
the
legislature
looking
at
the
changing
circumstances
may
wish
to
change
again.
but
if
this
court--
mr.
wj
michael
cody
--well,
i
have
no
information,
but
i
believe
that
it
would
be
unworkable
if
the
officer
is
put
to
the
task
of
trying
to
make
this
probable
cause
analysis
when
he
arrives
at
an
arrest
scene.
mr.
wj
michael
cody
that
it
has
worked
for
those
states,
or
that
they
have
chosen
to
let
some
fleeing
felons
escape
rather
than
jeopardize
their
life,
but
we
contend
that
that
is
a
policy
decision
for
the
legislature
to
make.
mr.
wj
michael
cody
if
the
court
please,
that
makes
a
difficult
question,
but
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
answer
that
if
there
was
a
state
antitrust
statute
that
provided
a
sufficient
enough
penalty
to
indicate
that
the
state's
substantial
interest
felt
that
that
was
a
serious
crime,
then
they
could
authorize
deadly
force.
the
situation
never
arises
because
they
can
identify
that
person,
and
you
don't
ever
get
to
the
last
resort.
mr.
wj
michael
cody
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
wj
michael
cody
if
the
court
please,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
the
only
case
that
directly
seemed
to
refer
to
this
had
a
property
crime,
the
stealing
of
a
small
amount
of
merchandise,
and
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
we
would
not
extend
the
privilege
to
that
case.
it
is
difficult,
however,
to
see
whether
it
was
because
there
were
other
means
of
apprehension
or
not.
i
think
that
the
tennessee
supreme
court
would
of
necessity,
based
upon
some
reasonable
interpretation,
make
the
crime
one
that
had
enough
seriousness
to
it
to
reflect
a
substantial
state
interest.
mr.
wj
michael
cody
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
is
the
error
in
the
court
of
appeals.
