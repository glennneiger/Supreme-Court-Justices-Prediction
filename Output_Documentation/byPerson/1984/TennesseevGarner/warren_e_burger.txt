chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
tennessee
against
garner
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
klein,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
winter?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
after
the
event
it
developed
there
were
two
dead
bodies
in
the
house
and
a
third
person
who
was
seriously
wounded
but
alive
who
later
identified
the
fleeing
felon
as
the
person
who
had
done
the
killing
and
the
wounding?
what
would
be
your
view?
chief
justice
burger
before
you
get
to
the
eye
witness,
you
have
to
apprehend
the
individual,
don't
you?
chief
justice
burger
if
he
isn't
apprehended,
the
eye
witness
is
not
much
help.
chief
justice
burger
well,
do
you
think
the
officer
was
able
to
know
whether
there
were
or
were
not
some
dead
bodies
in
the
house?
chief
justice
burger
if
in
fact
there
were
two
dead
bodies,
and
he
was
identified
as
the
killer,
what
would
have
been
the
maximum
penalty?
chief
justice
burger
these
statistics
based
upon
people
who
are
apprehended,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
burger
of
necessity.
those
who
are
not
apprehended,
there
is
no
basis
for
a
statistic,
is
there?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
familiar
with
the
statistics
in
new
york
city?
chief
justice
burger
as
to
what
percentage
of
all
crimes,
including
burglary,
are
ever
apprehended?
chief
justice
burger
it
is
something
less
than
15
percent.
chief
justice
burger
that
brings
me
back
to
some
of
your
responses,
and
i
will
repeat
again
the
question,
what
if
in
fact
there
were
two
or
three
dead
bodies
in
there
who
had
been
stabbed
to
death?
would
you
have
a
case?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
just
think
it
would
be
more
difficult?
chief
justice
burger
how
can
the
officer
conceivably
know
one
way
or
the
other
whether
there
are
or
whether
there
are
not
some
dead
bodies
inside
the
house?
chief
justice
burger
but
you
think
you
would
just
have
a
more
difficult
case
if
there
were
some
dead
bodies,
people
stabbed
to
death
in
the
house?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
klein?
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
