justice
o'connor
mr.
cody,
i
guess
some
states
have
adopted
a
more
restrictive
provision
than
tennessee
has,
and
something
more
along
the
lines
of
the
penal
code,
model
penal
code.
justice
o'connor
has
that
proved
to
be
workable
in
most
states,
do
you
know?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
understand,
but
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
any
more
restrictive
standard
would
be
unworkable,
and
so
i
was
curious.
justice
o'connor
would
you
think
that
a
burglar
who
enters
the
homes
or
residences
of
people
at
nighttime
is
a
danger
to
the
community?
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
suppose
the
homeowners
feel
about
whether
someone
who
burglarizes
homes
is
a
danger
to
the
community?
justice
o'connor
mr.
winter,
the
tennessee
law
does
require
some
kind
of
a
warning
by
the
officer
to
the
suspect?
justice
o'connor
but
was
told
to
stop
by
an
officer
in
uniform.
is
there
any
validity
to
the
concept
that
a
person,
a
suspect
in
those
circumstances
is
giving
up
certain
rights
by
refusing
to
heed
a
warning
of
that
kind
by
an
officer
in
uniform?
justice
o'connor
--well,
do
you
think
that
it
really
is
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
an
officer
who
would
tell
an
experienced
adult
burglar,
stop
or
i'll
shoot,
you
think
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
that?
you
think
that
there
is
no
room
there
for
saying
that
the
person
who
refuses
to
heed
that
warning
is
knowingly
giving
up
any
right
to
have
alternative
action
taken?
