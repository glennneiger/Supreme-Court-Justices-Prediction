mr.
klein--
justice
rehnquist
--did
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
across
the
board
or
on
its
face,
or
did
it
just
say
it
couldn't
constitute
a
defense
in
this
action?
justice
rehnquist
did
it
intimate
that
there
was
some
first
amendment
problem
involved
here?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
klein,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
if
i
may.
in
your
introduction
to
your
argument
in
your
brief,
you
say
that
the
tennessee
courts
have
interpreted
the
statute
to
allow
the
use
of
force
that
may
result
in
death
if
the
officer
reasonably
believes
that
the
person
has
committed
a
felony,
he
notifies
the
person
that
he
intends
to
arrest
him,
and
he
reasonably
believes
that
no
means
less
than
such
force
will
permit
the
escape.
now,
i
would
read
that
as
indicating
that
if
the
officer
thinks
that
by
shooting
to
would
the
person
and
he
can
prevent
the
escape,
that
he
is
obligated
to
do
that.
justice
rehnquist
shoot
for
the
what?
justice
rehnquist
what
you
are
talking
about
really
is
a
shot
that
has
a
potential
for
killing.
it
is
not
a
shot
intended
to
kill.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
winter,
this
was
an
action
for
damages,
was
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
and
the
state
asserted
the
statute
as
a
defense.
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
it
declares
the
statute
perhaps
facially
invalid.
is
that
your
reading
of
it,
too?
justice
rehnquist
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
a
very
happy
phrasing
of
any
question.
i
had
never
known
before
that
a
law
could
constitute
an
unreasonable
seizure.
justice
rehnquist
you
would
agree,
then,
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
goes
any
further
than
to
say
that
on
these
facts,
the
tennessee
defense
statute
can't
be
applied,
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong.
justice
rehnquist
so
we
are
talking
about
an
as
applied
basis,
not
an
on
its
face
basis.
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
memphis
policy,
i
had
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
deal
only
with
the
tennessee
statute.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
pass
on
it.
justice
rehnquist
how
would
you
know
whether
he
was
armed?
justice
rehnquist
so
the
officer
has
to
know
that
the
person...
if
he
is
armed
but
the
officer
doesn't
know
it,
the
officer
can't
shoot.
justice
rehnquist
a
person
can
be
armed
and
can
be
not
reaching
for
his
weapon
one
minute,
and
15
seconds
later
he
can
be
reaching
for
his
weapon.
justice
rehnquist
and
not
until
then?
justice
rehnquist
what
about
someone
thought
to
be
guilty
of
espionage
or
treason?
obviously,
this
would
affect
federal
statutes
if
you
are
correct.
justice
rehnquist
yours
would
not
make
an
exception
because
treason
and
espionage
are
not
crimes
of
violence?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
but
we
are
not
talking
just
about...
at
least
your
argument
isn't
premised
just
on
the
fact
that
this
particular
plaintiff
was
15
years
old,
perceived
to
be
17
years
old.
i
mean,
if
you
are
talking
about
giving
up
some
rights
when
you
refuse
to
heed,
you
are
equally
talking
about
a
cold
sober
45-year-old.
justice
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
in
every
instance
the
particular
policeman
who
shot
was
acting
in
conformity
with
the
tennessee
law?
justice
rehnquist
that
might
be
useful
evidence
in
your
attack
on
the
memphis
practice.
it
is
certainly
not
any
good
evidence
at
all
in
your
attack
on
the
tennessee
statute.
