mr.
klein,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
stevens
supposing
there
had
been
another
officer
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
unbeknownst
to
the
man
who
felt
it
necessary
to
shoot
the
fleeing
felon,
and
he
had
later
been...
say
he
had
missed
and
he
had
actually
been
apprehended.
what
penalty
could
the
state
have
imposed
on
him
under
your
code
for
the
crime
of
not
submitting
to
the
officer's
demand?
justice
stevens
yes,
fleeing.
what
sort
of
crime
is
it?
justice
stevens
but
you
understand
my
hypothetical.
just
say
instead
of
shooting
him
they
had
been
able
to
catch
him.
he
has
committed
a
crime,
surely,
of
escaping
in
defiance
of
the
officer's
command
to
halt.
i
am
just
wondering,
what
is
the
penalty
under
tennessee
law
for
that
crime?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
he
is
subject
to
penalty
for
that.
but
i
assume
he
has
committed
a
separate
offense
when
he
flees.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
it
is
not
a
state
violation?
justice
stevens
so
the
only
deterrent
that
the
state
imposes
for
that
offense
really
is
to
shoot
the
man
at
the
time.
justice
stevens
that's
right.
but
if
he
can
apprehend
him,
basically
you
are
telling
me
there
really
is
no
legislative
deterrent
other
than
the
threat
that
if
you
don't
get
away
you
might
get
shot.
justice
stevens
mr.
klein,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
what
we
mean
by
the
term
"deadly
force"?
do
we
mean
that
the
officer
can
deliberately
shoot
to
kill
the
individual?
justice
stevens
and
it
also
means,
i
take
it,
that
he
may
deliberately
shoot
to
kill.
justice
stevens
or
doesn't
it
mean
that?
i
am
just
trying
to
understand.
justice
stevens
so
it
is
really
more
than
apprehending
him
then.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question,
just
briefly?
in
measuring
the
state
policy
at
stake,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
klein
that
there
is
no
legislative
determination
of
the
appropriate
punishment
for
fleeing
in
these
circumstances?
justice
stevens
is
that
right?
i
am
just
trying
to
think
it
through.
are
we
thinking
about
the
statute
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
or
is
applied
to
hypotheticals
in
both
directions?
justice
stevens
all
i
was
suggesting
is,
if
we
measure
the
police
officer's
conduct
as
applied
in
this
case,
should
we
not
also
analyze
the
waiver
issue
as
applied,
or
do
we
have
one
rule
for
one
situation
and
another
for--
justice
stevens
mr.
winter,
before
you
sit
down,
you
didn't
get
to
your
third
argument,
and
i
just
am
not
clear
on
one
factual
matter.
does
the
record
tell
us
the
race
of
the
victim
and
the
race
of
the
officer
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
of
course
he
wouldn't
be
shot
just
for
the
burglary.
he
is
shot
because
he
tried
to
escape.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
it
still
puzzles
me
that
the
legislature
didn't
make
that
a
serious
crime
as
well,
because
i
think
that
is
a
serious
matter.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
would
suppose
you
would
agree
that
the
state
could
not
adopt
a
statute
making
it
a
capital
offense
to
flee
in
these
circumstances.
justice
stevens
so
there
are
some
limits
on
the
state's
power.
