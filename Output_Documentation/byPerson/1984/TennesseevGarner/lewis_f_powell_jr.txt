justice
jr.
what
is
the
penalty
for
first
degree
burglary?
justice
jr.
no
more
than
40?
justice
jr.
when
a
weapon
is
involved?
justice
jr.
mr.
klein,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
in
your
reply
brief,
you
emphasize
the
memphis
policy,
and
you
say
that
it
is
limited
to
situations
where
there
are
violent
crimes,
and
you
list
the
types
of
violent
crimes.
justice
jr.
does
the
memphis...
you
call
it
a
policy.
is
it
a
state
ordinance,
a
city
ordinance?
justice
jr.
a
general
order
by
the
city
council?
justice
jr.
the
police
department.
justice
jr.
does
the
police
department
have
authority
to
limit
the
full
scope
of
state
law?
justice
jr.
do
you
consider
this
ordinance
consistence
with
state
law?
justice
jr.
is
state
law
limited
only
to
serious
violent
crimes?
justice
jr.
it
doesn't
say
so,
does
it?
justice
jr.
serious
or
violent?
justice
jr.
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
serious
and
violent?
justice
jr.
suppose
this
house
or
building,
instead
of
being
a
private
residence,
had
been
a
deserted
building
in
a
field
somewhere.
would
the
officer
still
have
had
the
right
under
tennessee
law
to
shoot
a
person
fleeing
from
the
scene
who
apparently
had
broken
into
it?
justice
jr.
of
course,
your
memphis
policy
would
cover
burglary
in
the
third
degree.
justice
jr.
general,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
a
question
somewhat
similar
to
justice
blackmun's.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
question
in
this
case
was
whether
under
state
law
a
nonviolent
fleeing
felon,
unarmed,
could
be
shot
by
the
police
to
prevent
his
escape.
i
am
interested
in
whether
or
not
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
would
apply
its
statute
to
an
unarmed,
nonviolent
fleeing
felon.
justice
jr.
you
do
not
draw
the
line
with
respect
to
violent
and
nonviolent
crimes?
