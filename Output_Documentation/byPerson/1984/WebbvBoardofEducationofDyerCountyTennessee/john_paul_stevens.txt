justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question,
mr.
ralston?
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
that
the
court
allowed
you
fees
from
the
period
of
august
'78
forward,
and
i
looked
at
pages
46
and
47
of
the
transcript
and
i
wonder
if
you
meant
'78
or
'79,
because
it--
justice
stevens
--and
is
it
your
contention
that
everything
that
precedes
that,
it
was
reasonably
necessary
in
order
to
prepare
and
prosecute
the
federal
case?
justice
stevens
of
course,
the
district
court
did
something
else
that
smacks
of
a
compromise
in
a
way.
he
gave
you,
i
think,
$120
or
$125
an
hour
for
all
that
time,
and
then
added
a
25
percent
amount
for
it.
and
i
guess
your
rate,
your
going
rate,
was
only...
was
a
lesser
amount
at
the
beginning
of
the
period,
was
it
not?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
right.
but
you're
in
effect,
your
legal
position
here
is
that
at
least
some
of
time
should
have
been
counted?
you're
not
necessarily
claiming
that
every
hour
of
the
four
or
five
years
of
negotiating
with
the
school
board
was
necessary
for
the
lawsuit?
or
are
you
saying
it's
more
or
less
like
carey,
that
it
was
all
essential?
there's
quite
a
difference
in
theory.
i
guess
i'm
repeating
justice
o'connor's
question
in
a
way.
justice
stevens
as
necessary
to
the
federal
litigation?
justice
stevens
well,
he
at
least
gave
you
the
time
it
took
you
to
write
the
complaint.
justice
stevens
he
didn't
begin
with
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
at
least.
justice
stevens
well,
but
is
that
true
if
he
filed
a
1983
action
in
the
state
court?
could
he
not
have
filed
the
same
action,
based
on
federal
law,
but
filed
it
in
the
state
court--
justice
stevens
--they
don't
accept
1983
litigation?
justice
stevens
is
that
cited
in
the
briefs?
i
missed
it,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
do
you
have
any
question
about
whether
that's
good
law
today
or
not?
justice
stevens
they're
not...
i
see.
justice
stevens
mr.
ralston,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
on
that
point.
supposing
there
is
one
day
of
work
in
the
state
proceeding
that
clearly
did
not
facilitate
anything
in
the
federal
proceeding.
just,
you
had
to
go
in
and
get
a
continuance
or
some
stipulation
about
state
procedure,
but
you
spent
six
or
seven
hours
doing
it.
but
you
would
not
have
had
to
do
that
in
order
to
bring
out
your
federal
case.
are
you
entitled
to
pay
for
that
time?
justice
stevens
so
you're
not
claiming
that
you're
entitled
to
be
compensated
for
all
the
time
spent
in
the
administrative
proceeding,
all
time
necessary
to
that
proceeding?
justice
stevens
it's
hard
to
get
the
flavor
of
it,
but
as
i
read
the
district
court
opinion
i
thought
he
was
treating
the
claim
as
though
the
lawyer
who
was
then
representing
the
plaintiff
thought
he
was
entitled
as
a
matter
of
law
to
be
compensated
for
the
time
in
that
proceeding
more
or
less
as
he
is
in
the
federal
proceeding.
justice
stevens
but
see,
i
got
the
impression
the
parties
didn't
fight
about
the
allocation,
that
there
was
kind
of
an
agreement
that
58
hours
was
on
the
federal
case
and
82
hours
was
on
the
state
proceeding,
and
you
either
got
the
82
hours
or
you
didn't.
and
i
think
you're
making
a
little
different
argument
now.
justice
stevens
and
you
in
effect
argue
you're
entitled
to
all
of
it.
justice
stevens
that's
what
i
don't
find,
is
the
"unless
you
can
convince"
part.
