justice
white
i
would
find
it
rather
strange
to
have
the
constitutional
issues
presented
to
and
passed
on
by
an
administrative
agency
or
a
county
board.
for
example,
what
if
the
county
board
had
concluded
that
this
action
comported
entirely
with
tennessee
law,
it
violated
nothing
in
tennessee
law.
we've
had
a
hearing
on
it
and
everybody
turned
square
corners.
do
you
think
it
would
have
entertained
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
white
but
it
certainly
could
hardly
comport
with
tennessee
law,
then,
could
it?
justice
white
is
there
any
provision
for
judicial
review
of
the
county
board's
decision
at
the
end
of
this
sort
of
an
administrative
process?
justice
white
and
i
take
it,
then,
that
your
constitutional
claim
was
rejected
by
the
county
board?
justice
white
well,
they
certainly
didn't
grant
it.
justice
white
so
ordinarily
you
would
say
they
rejected
it.
justice
white
so
why
didn't
you
take
it
to
the
tennessee
courts?
justice
white
you
don't
think
that...
you
don't
think
that
if
you
don't
appeal
a
county
commissions's
judgment,
that
doesn't
foreclose
you
from
another
judicial
action?
justice
white
there's
no
administrative
res
judicata?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
title
vii
requires
you
to
go
to
the
court
and
specifically
leaves
the
court
open
after
you've
resorted
to
that.
justice
white
it
may
not,
it
may
not.
but
if
you
had
taken
this...
if
you
had
taken
an
appeal
from
the
county
commission's
judgment
into
the
tennessee
courts
and
you
had
lost
there,
you
could
not
come
over
to
federal
court?
justice
white
could
you?
justice
white
well,
if
they
weren't
raised
you
weren't
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees.
justice
white
well,
is
there
any
tennessee
law
on
whether
or
not
administrative
agencies
or
county
boards
will
entertain
federal
constitutional
claims?
justice
white
entertain
1983--
justice
white
--let
me
ask
you
this.
let
me
ask
you
this.
isn't
there
some
law
in
tennessee
as
to
whether
administrative
agencies
will
entertain
state
constitutional
claims,
as
well
as
the
claims
under
the
specific
statutes
that
regulate...
that
set
out
the
substantive
standards
for
their
work?
justice
white
are
there
any
kinds
of
decisions
in
your
courts?
justice
white
or
any
custom
of
your
administrative
agencies?
justice
white
did
you
represent
the
board?
justice
white
well,
was
there
any
objection
by
counsel
to
entertaining
these
claims
or
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
to
support
them?
justice
white
mr.
ralston,
suppose
there's
a
case
where
everything
you
do
to
enforce
your
state
rights,
state
statutory
or
state
constitutional
rights,
are
absolutely
the
same
as
what
you
would
be
doing
to
enforce
the
federal
right,
and
in
the
state
proceeding
you
just...
you
have
a
federal
constitutional
claim,
but
you
also
have
these
state
claims,
and
you
just
go
forward.
justice
white
even
though
if
he
hadn't
joined
his
claim,
his
federal
claim,
he
would
have
done
exactly
the
same
thing?
