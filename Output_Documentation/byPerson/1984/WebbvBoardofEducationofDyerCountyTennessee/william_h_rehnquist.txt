justice
rehnquist
mr.
ralston,
the
district
court's
memorandum
as
i
read
it
refers
to
the
state
administrative
proceeding
as
one
before
the
county
board
of
education
of
dyer
county,
tennessee.
justice
rehnquist
you
say
you
were
pursuing
the
federal
claim
before
that,
the
county
board.
what's
the
nature
of
that
proceeding
under
tennessee?
justice
rehnquist
what
are
the
standards
for
showing
that
you're
entitled
to
reinstatement?
is
it
kind
of
a
breach
of
tenure
kind
of
thing?
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
indication
in
this
statutory
language
that
a
federal
claim
is
contemplated?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
ordinarily
expect
a
county
board
of
supervisors
to
pass
on
constitutional
claims?
justice
rehnquist
but
they
probably
would
have
dealt
with
it
under
some
principle
of
state
law,
rather
than
saying
something
was
unconstitutional.
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
really
claim
to
know
anything
about
tennessee
proceedings.
are
you
familiar
with
the
way
county
boards
in
tennessee
conduct
their
affairs,
whether
this
is
a
typical
claim
brought
before
them?
justice
rehnquist
a
moment
ago,
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
you
said
there
had
been...
at
least
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
had
been
no
final
disposition
of
the
state
administrative
proceeding.
justice
rehnquist
against
the
plaintiff.
justice
rehnquist
right.
