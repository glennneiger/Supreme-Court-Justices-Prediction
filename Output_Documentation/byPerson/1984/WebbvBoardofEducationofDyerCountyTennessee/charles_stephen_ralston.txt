mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
for
the
court
a
single
issue,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
attorney
time
expended
before
a
civil
rights
action
is
brought
under
1981
and
1983,
title
42
of
the
united
states
code,
is
filed
in
federal
court,
work
done
before
that
filing,
can
that
time
be
excluded
from
a
fee
award
simply
because
the
time
was
spent
pursuing
the
same
federal
claim
in
an
available
state
administrative
proceeding.
our
position,
petitioner's
position,
is
quite
simply
that
it
should
not
and
cannot
be
excluded,
that
it
is
awardable
under
the
specific
language
of
42
u.s.c.
section
1988
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
interpret
that
statute.
our
position
is,
first,
that
if
that
time,
as
we
contend
it
was
here,
is
reasonably
expended,
reasonably
spent,
then
within
the
meaning
of
section
1988
and
this
court's
decision
in
hensley
versus
eckerhart,
then
it
can
be
compensated
for.
that
is,
it
is
chargeable
to
the
defendant
when
the
plaintiff
prevails
in
his
federal
court
action.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
could
have
gone
straight
to
the
federal
court,
and
that
is
true.
and
the
court
below
based
their
decision
on
the
principle
that,
since
it
was
not
mandatory
that
the
state
administrative
proceedings
be
exhausted
and
we
did
not
have
to
go
into
federal
court,
therefore
the
time
should
not
be
compensated
for.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
in
the
patsy
case,
which
held
that
exhaustion
is
not
required,
this
court
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
concerns
of
congress
when
it
passed
1983
was
to
provide
concurrent
remedies
in
both
state
and
federal
courts.
so
there's
certainly
no
intention
of
congress
or
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
discourage
the
going
and
utilization
of
an
available
state
remedy,
which
is
precisely
the
result
of
the
decision
below.
the
result
would
be
to
tell
to
a
potential
plaintiff
that,
go
straight
into
federal
court,
do
not
spend
any
time
at
all
pursuing
any
other
available
remedy.
go
into
federal
court,
because
if
you
don't
you
will
lose
any
time
you
spend
prior
to
going
into
federal
court.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
we
have
reprinted
in
our
brief,
our
main
brief,
in
the
appendix,
pages
1a
to
4a,
the
statute
under
tennessee
law
which
sets
out
the
proceeding.
now,
that
proceeding
and
what
occurred
before
the
dyer
county
board
of
education
followed
that
statute.
there's
a
right
to
charges,
there's
a
right
to
have
witnesses
subpoenaed,
there's
a
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
there's
a
right
to
present
the
claims
that
the
person
has
and
have
them
considered
by
the
board.
and
indeed,
the
statute
even
provides
that
if
the
teacher
prevails
the
board
can
award
the
teacher
his
costs.
so
it
is
an
administrative
proceeding
and
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
certainly
under
the
tenure
act
there
is
that.
you'd
have
the
right
to
do
that.
if
your
rights
under
the
tennessee
tenure
law
have
been
violated,
you
can
present
those.
but
the
statute
does
not
limit
what
can
be
presented
to
the
board.
section
512(4),
which
is
at
3a
of
our
appendix,
states
that:
"the
teacher
may
present
witnesses
and
shall
have
full
opportunity
to
present
his
contentions
and
to
support
them
with
evidence
and
argument.
"
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
there
is
certainly
no
language
that
indicates
that
it
could
not
be
presented.
it
simply
says
mr.
webb's
attorney
presented
squarely
claims
arising
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution,
presented
evidence
to
support
the
claim
that
racial
discrimination
was
behind
the
attempted
disciplinary
action.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
your
honor,
it
certainly
is
not
the
normal
kind
of
case
they'll
handle.
but
to
give
an
example,
we
said
in
our
brief,
the
basic
claim
of
mr.
webb
was
that
everything
was
fine
in
his
employment
until
integration
came
and
he,
a
black
teacher,
was
assigned
to
teach
in
a
predominantly
white
school
and
he
imposed
the
same
kind
of
discipline
he
had
imposed
throughout
his
career
on
a
white
student,
and
that
was
the
reason
why
he
was
discharged.
now,
assume
for
the
moment...
and
he
presented
evidence
to
support
that
claim.
assume
for
the
moment
it
turned
out
that
indeed
there
was
such
a
policy.
a
document
had
appeared
saying
that
a
black
teacher
who
disciplined
white
students
should
be
discharged.
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
the
county
board
would
not
have
dealt
with
that
claim
and
reinstated
mr.
webb.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
the
members
of
the
county
board
i
would
assume,
as
are
all
other
state
officials,
are
bound
by
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
to
conform
their
activities
to
that
constitution.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
i
am
not.
i
am
familiar
with
the
record
in
this
case,
and
in
this
case
the
claims
were
squarely
presented,
listened
to.
most
of
the
testimony
before
the
board
dealt
with...
most,
at
least
half
of
it,
dealt
with
the
racial
discrimination
claim
which
was
presented
under
constitutional
terms.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
if
given
the
hypothetical
i've
given,
if
it
had
emerged
that
in
fact
there
was
a
policy
to
discharge
black
teachers
in
violation
of
their
rights
to
be
free
of
racial
discrimination,
i
would
hope
that
they
would
entertain
such
a
claim
and
that
they
would
not
allow
such
a
discharge.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
it
might
not
have.
but
it
was
presented
as
a
federal
constitutional
claim.
but
the
issue
again...
again,
the
facts
of
this
case
is
the
claim
was
presented,
it
was
heard
by
the
board,
it
was
not
excluded,
evidence
was
not
excluded.
and
indeed,
reading
the
transcript,
it
even
indicates
it
was
objected
to.
and
the
question
again
is
whether
it
was
reasonable
to
attempt
to
have
those
rights
vindicated
by
the
county
board
before
going
straight
into
federal
court.
now,
we
pointed
out
that
the
judge
in
the
district
court
excluded
absolutely
all
time
spent
prior
to
the
actual
sitting
down
and
drawing
up
of
the
complaint
to
go
into
federal
court,
the
82.8
hours
as
shown
by
the
joint
appendix.
pages
39
to
47
set
out
the
time.
but
everything
prior
to
the
work
done
in
august
of
1977
to
actually
prepare
to
go
to
federal
court
was
excluded.
and
in
that
time
such
things
were
done
as
to
investigate
the
case,
talk
to
witnesses,
talk
to
the
client,
to
in
fact
in
effect
have
depositions
of
two
witnesses,
at
least
two
witnesses
of
the
defendant...
all
time
that
would
be
compensable
if
it
had
been
done
in
connection
with
the
federal
court
action.
yet
it's
excluded,
absolutely
simply
because
that
work
was
done
in
connection
with
the
state
administrative
proceeding.
and
again,
our
contention
is
it
was
reasonable
to
do
that
work
and
in
fact
it
was
the
type
of
work
that
anyone
would
have
done
if
he
had
gone
straight
into
federal
court
and
prosecuted
his
federal
claim.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
under
tennessee
law
review
can
be
sought
in
the
tennessee
courts.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
they
simply
issued
a
short
decision
saying--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--they
certainly
didn't
grant
it.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
at
that
point,
your
honor,
we
had
the
option
of
going
either
to
federal
court
or
to
state
court,
and
the
counsel
decided
that
they
would
prefer
going
to
federal
court
at
that
point,
now
that
they
were
going
to
have
to
go
to
court.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not
say...
no,
we
take
the
position
that
it
doesn't.
this
court
has
held--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--not
under
a
claim
under
1981,
i
would
urge
not.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
has
held
that
in
a
title
vii
case
the
fact
that
one
goes
to--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--yes,
but
1981
and
1983
also
allow
an
independent
federal
claim
to
be
brought.
i
might
just
say
that
this
argument
was
never
made
in
the
court
below,
that
this
had
some
preclusive
effect.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
as
i--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--well,
if
the
federal
constitutional
claims
had
been
raised
and
had
a
final
decision
from
the
state
courts,
yes.
if
they
were
not
raised,
then
it
would
depend
on
tennessee
law,
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
if
they
weren't
raised
in
state
court,
yes.
but
if
they'd
been
raised
in
the
administrative
process
and
then
gone
to
state
court
without
raising
them,
whether
we
could
get
into
federal
court
would
depend
on
tennessee
law.
but
if
we
had
gone
to
a
tennessee
court,
raised
them
and
had
lost,
then
that
would
have
been
preclusive.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
our
response...
at
some
point
during
the
litigation,
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
before
the
board
of
education
were
filed,
introduced
by
the
plaintiff.
it
was
subsequent
to
that
that
the
case
was
settled.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
the
record
is
not
clear,
although
in
the
hearing
on
counsel
fees
the
district
court
stated
that
he
had
in
fact
read
those
proceeding.
he
did
not
elaborate,
but
he
did
discuss
that--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--it
was
introduced
as
an
attachment
to
an
affidavit
by
counsel
for
mr.
webb
attesting
to
their
accuracy.
the
case
didn't
get
to
the
point
where
they
were
stipulated
into
evidence
because
the
case
was
settled
prior
to
trial.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
they
were
put
in
at
a
point
where
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
pending
before
the
district
court
relating
to
a
number
of
issues.
none
of
those
motions
were
ever
resolved
because
the
case
was
settled.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
in
the
present
case,
the
court
only
need
reach
the
second
point,
because
in
this
case
we
had
an
action
filed
in
federal
court
to
raise
the
merits
of
the
claim,
there
was
no
final
disposition
in
the
state
administrative
processes.
so
this
case
itself
presents
the
claim
that
the
time
spent
in
the
administrative
process
can
be
compensated
because
it
was
reasonable
time
spent
in
connection
with
the
federal
court
action.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
the
other
question...
carey
did
hold,
at
least
in
the
context
of
a
title
vii
case,
that
an
action
could
be
brought
solely
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
counsel
fees.
and
we
would
think
such
a
result
would
be
consistent
with
carey.
alternatively,
as
we
pointed
out,
an
action
might
lie
in
state
court
under
maine
versus
thiboutot
to
recover
counsel
fees
if
the
person
were
fully
successful
with
regard
to
his
federal
constitutional
claim
in
the
state
administrative
proceeding.
and
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i'm
sorry,
not
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
the
disposition
had
been
to--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--against
the
plaintiff.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i'm
sorry,
i
did
not
mean
to
indicate
otherwise.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
'79,
i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke.
from
3-7
august
'79,
preparation
and
forwarding
of
the
complaint
in
federal
court,
that
was
the
time
allowed.
everything
else
before
that
was
excluded.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
is
our
contention.
now,
the
district
court
never
reached
the
question
whether
there
were
particular
parts
of
that
82.8
hours
that
might
or
might
not
have
been
reasonably
spent.
so
there
was
never
any
decision,
and
the
respondents'
main
claim
was
none
of
it
could
be
compensated
for
because
it
was
done
in
connection
with
the
administrative
proceeding.
they
did
raise
some
general
objections
to
a
couple
of
items.
but
the
issue
of
whether
every
minute
of
that
time
should
have
been
compensated
for
was
never
reached.
ordinarily
in
these
cases,
the
district
court
will
look
at
the
time--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--it's
my
understanding
that
the
rate
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
may
have
been
less.
but
he
gave
the
current
rate
for
the
time
spent
in
federal
court
and
then
enhanced
it
by
a
multiplier.
now,
this
case
was
decided
before
blum
versus
stenson.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
and
the
respondents
did
not
cross-petition
on
that
issue.
so
it
really
is
not
before
the
court
at
all.
i
just
might
point
out
that,
even
with
that
multiplier,
since
the
court
excluded
far
more
than
half
of
the
hours
requested,
the
total
amount
given
was
still
substantially
less
than
what
would
have
been
given
if
that
82.8
hours
had
been
included
and
no
multiplier
given
at
all.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
our
contention
would
be,
if
we
were
in
the
situation
in
district
court
to
justify
all
those
hours,
that
they
could
be
justified.
the
district
court--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--as
necessary.
now,
the
district
court
might
say,
well,
some
percentage
wasn't
really
related
to
the
federal
question
and,
using
a
hensley
type
analysis,
split
some
of
it
off.
but
again,
that
was
never
done
in
the
district
court
because
of
the
district
court's
ruling
as
a
matter
of
law
that
none
of
it
was
compensable,
period.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
pardon?
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
he
allowed
us
to
prepare
and
write
it.
but
anything
else
was
not
allowed.
and
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
time
spent
in
preparation
to
filing
the
investigation
and
talking
to
people
is
an
important
amount
of
time
spent,
and
certainly
a
substantial
amount
of
the
time
spent
was
very
comparable
to
just
what
one
would
do
through
discovery.
this
court
has
pointed
out,
for
example,
in
chandler
versus
rotabush
that
the
time...
the
record
of
an
administrative
proceeding
may
be
very
useful
to
a
court
in
sharpening
the
issues,
limiting
what
happened.
and
that
certainly
is,
we're
arguing,
we
take
the
position,
is
the
case
here.
again,
the
central
point
that
we
would
make
is
that
the
lower
courts
here
became
focused
in
on
the
mandatory
issue,
and
our
position
is
that
the
statute
does
not
say
any
mandatory
proceeding.
it
says
any
proceeding.
the
fact
that
a
proceeding
is
mandatory,
it
must
be
followed,
certainly
makes
it
reasonable
to
follow
it,
but
it
doesn't
follow
the
other
way,
that
just
because
something
need
not
be
done
it
is
not
reasonable
to
do
it
and
therefore
compensable.
and
as
a
matter
of
policy,
to
essentially
penalize
someone
for
attempting
to
enforce
his
rights
before
going
to
federal
court
would
simply
mean
an
increase
in
cases
filed
in
federal
courts
and
a
much
longer
time
spent
in
federal
court
than
if
this
type
of
time
were
compensated
for.
i'd
like,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
a
very
few
responses.
with
regard
to
what
went
on
in
the
administrative
process
and
what
was
sought
in
district
court,
it
is
true
that
broader
relief
was
initially
sought
in
district
court,
but
the
case
was
actually
settled
based
on
exactly
what
the
school
board
could
have
granted.
that
is,
the
back
pay
plus
in
this
case,
since
mr.
webb
had
gotten
another
job,
not
reinstatement
but
the
wiping
out,
expungement
of
his
record
and
allowing
to
change
a
dismissal
to
a
resignation.
indeed,
if
one
looks
at
the
transcript
of
the
hearings
before
the
school
board,
it
reads
remarkably
like
a
proceeding
to
vindicate
a
racial
discrimination
claim,
a
claim
of
racial
discrimination
in
employment
in
an
individual
discrimination
claim
brought
under
section
1981.
for
that
reason,
the
work
that
was
done
clearly
was
relevant
to
the
federal
claims,
and
clearly
we
believe
aided
in
the
ultimate
resolution
of
this
case
through
settlement.
with
regard
to
whether
our
rule
that
we
request
would
open
up
further
litigation
over
what
is
reasonable,
again,
the
district
courts
on
a
daily
basis,
dealing
with
counsel
fee
applications,
deal
with
whether
some
particular
time
spent
was
reasonable,
with
regard
to
whether
it
was
necessary
to
spend
so
much
time
taking
depositions,
which
are
not
done
before
the
court,
whether
discovery
was
reasonable,
whether
other
activities.
if
the
defendant
objects
to
time
as
being
too
much,
being
unreasonable,
then
the
district
courts
have
found
themselves
perfectly
capable
of
dealing
with
that.
and
frankly,
i
don't
see
anything
inherently
more
difficult
in
dealing
with
looking
at
an
administrative
proceeding
such
as
was
gone
through
here
and
deciding
whether
or
not
what
was
done
was
reasonable
in
terms
of
attempting
to
enforce
federal
civil
rights.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
in
that
particular
instance
the
district
court
could
very
well
look
at
that
and
say,
that
was
not
time
reasonably
spent
in
vindication
of
federal
civil
rights,
that's
not
compensable
here.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
not
necessarily.
i
mean,
it
depends
on
the
circumstances,
just
as
if
the
case
had
gone
straight
into
federal
court
the
district
court
might
decide
that
someone
spent
20
hours
researching
a
memo
and
they
could
have
done
it
in
two
hours
or
it
wasn't
necessary
really
to
do
it
at
all.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
the
counsel
for
plaintiff
was
arguing
that
all
the
time
was
reasonably
spent
and
therefore
he
should
be
compensated
for
it
fully.
now,
if
the
district
court
had
reached
that
issue
he
may
have
well
disagreed
and
said:
well,
no,
i'm
only
going
to
give
you
for
50
hours
or
60
hours.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
the
defendants
objected
to
any
of
the
time
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
that's
the
issue
that
we're
focusing
on.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
we
said,
yes,
we're
entitled
to
all
of
it
unless
you
can
convince
the
court
that
some
of
it--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--well,
i
guess
that
issue
was
never
reached,
your
honor,
because
it
all
got
focused
in
on
whether
any
of
it
could
be
compensated
at
all
and
that's
the
way
it
was
decided.
now,
the
defendants
did
also
object
to
certain...
they
said
14
hours
going
to
and
from
a
hearing
was
too
much.
i
imagine
plaintiff's
counsel
are
wont
to
say
that
was
necessary.
you
know,
plaintiffs'
counsel
don't
like
to
lose
hours
that
they're
going
to
get
paid
for.
but
the
court,
district
court,
never
grappled
with
that
issue
at
all.
it
just
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
in
that
case
it
would
be
the
same
issue
that
was
grappled
with,
i
think,
in
hensley.
if
the
claims
are
so
intertwined
as
to
be
not
divisible
and
if
the
party
prevails,
then
they'd
be
entitled
to
be
compensated
for
that
time,
assuming
that
it
was
a
substantial
federal
claim.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes.
if
he
has
presented
a
substantial
federal
claim
and
hasn't
just
thrown
it
in
there
to
try
to
get
fees...
and
in
this
case
these
facts
do
not
present
that
circumstance,
because
here
was
a
substantial
federal
claim,
particularly
the
claim
of
racial
discrimination
which
was
the
heart
of
mr.
webb's
claim
all
along...
then
he
should
be
compensated
for
it
under
hensley.
thank
you.
