justice
o'connor
mr.
ralston,
may
i
ask
whether
by
relying
on
carey
you're
asking
us
to
hold
that
section
1988
creates
an
independent
action
for
attorneys'
fees
for
time
spent
in
administrative
proceedings,
or
whether
you
are
asking
us
to
say
that
you
can
recover
something
for
attorneys'
fees
just
to
the
extent
you
would
be
able
to
do
so
anyway,
like
for
discovery
conducted
before
a
federal
action?
it
isn't
clear
to
me
what
you're
asking.
justice
o'connor
and
what
do
you
think
about
the
other
question?
justice
o'connor
mr.
headrick,
in
a
case
in
which
a
claimant
files
a
state
administrative
proceeding
and
does
urge
the
same
grounds
as
he
later
urges
in
a
federal
civil
rights
action,
and
spends
time
preparing
for
that
administrative
hearing
and
doing
what
amounts
to
discovery
for
purposes
of
dealing
with
the
hearing,
and
later
in
the
federal
civil
rights
action
relies
on
some
of
that
time
and
effort
as
part
of
his
preparation
for
the
federal
claim
in
the
federal
court,
is
any
of
that
time
recoverable
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
though
certainly
time
spent
for
ordinary
civil
discovery
would
be
recoverable,
would
it
not,
under
section
1988
for
preparation
time
for
the
1983
or
1981
claim?
justice
o'connor
and
if
the
work
done
is
essentially
the
equivalent
of
discovery
in
the
administrative
proceeding,
why
should
it
not
be
recoverable?
justice
o'connor
on
the
other
hand,
as
justice
blackmun
points
out,
the
costs
of
not
at
least
permitting
the
courts
to
consider
the
preparation
time
is
to
provide
a
disincentive
to
follow
alternative
remedies
and
stay
out
of
court
altogether.
