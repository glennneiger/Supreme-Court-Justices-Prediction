mr.
s.
russell
headrick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
would
contend,
in
opposition
to
petitioner's
assertion,
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
time
spent
in
the
administrative
proceeding
can
be
excluded,
but
whether
congress
intended
to
include
within
the
purview
of
section
1988,
intended
to
sanction
an
award
of
fees
for
optional
state
administrative
proceedings.
and
we
contend
that
when
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
and
the
purposes
behind
section
1988,
as
well
as
the
substantive
civil
rights
statutes
for
which
fees
are
properly
awardable,
are
considered,
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
this
case,
as
we
understand
it,
petitioner
has
essentially
advanced
two
arguments
in
support
of
his
proposition
that
fees
are
properly
awardable
for
optional
state
administrative
proceedings
under
section
1988.
first,
the
petitioner
contends...
and
this
is
what
i
call
his
reasonableness
argument...
that
he
filed
an
action
in
the
federal
court,
he
prevailed
in
settlement
of
the
action,
and
therefore
the
only
question
left
for
resolution
by
the
courts
is
whether
time
was
reasonably
spent.
if
so,
petitioner
contends
hensley
versus
eckerhart
compels
an
award
of
fees
in
the
instant
case.
we
say
that
this
argument
basically
fails
for
two
different
reasons.
in
effect,
what
the
petitioner
is
requesting
this
court
to
do
is
to
view
the
state
administrative
proceedings
and
the
federal
district
court
proceedings
as
one
unit
of
litigation,
when
in
reality
there
are
two
independent
legal
procedures.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
the
issue
was
just
raised
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
respondents,
i've
taken
a
look
at
tennessee
law,
and
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
reaffirmed,
most
recently
in
1979,
tennessee's
adherence
to
the
american
rule.
and
there
is
no
statute
that
i'm
aware
of
that
would
authorize
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees
had
the
petitioner
in
this
case
followed
the
state
judicial
route
and
had
appealed
and
won
his
case
and
won
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
no,
sir,
not
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
no,
sir,
not
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
it's
been
held
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
a
case
that
arose
about
15,
20
years
ago
that
the
courts
of
the
state
of
tennessee
do
not
entertain
section
1983
actions.
that
case
has
not
been
overruled
to
this
day.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
and
unfortunately
i
do
not
have
the
citation
of
that
case
with
me,
and
i'd
be
happy
to
supply
that
to
the
court.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
well,
i
understand
that
there
is
some
question
under
a
footnote,
i
believe
in
the
martinez
case,
as
to
whether
or
not
state
courts
are
obligated
to
entertain
section
1983
actions.
but
that's
still
the
law.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
yes,
sir.
and
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
administrative
action
is
separate
from
the
federal
civil
rights
action
was
recently
noted
and
supported
by
this
court's
opinion
in
burnett
versus
grattan,
where
this
court
noted
that
the
causes
of
action
which
congress
created
in
the
federal
civil
rights
acts
are
independent
of
other
legal
or
administrative
relief
which
may
be
otherwise
available
under
state
or
federal
law.
so
therefore,
we
think
that
the
petitioner's
argument
which
seeks
to
view
this
as
one
unit
of
litigation
ignores
this
fundamental
distinction
of
federal
law.
second
and
probably
more
importantly,
petitioner's
argument
jumps
over
the
very
statutory
threshold
issue
which
we
view
as
presented
by
this
case,
and
that
statutory
threshold
issue
is
whether
the
optional
state
administrative
proceedings
were
actions
or
proceedings,
if
you
will,
as
that
term
is
used
in
section
1988.
and
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
hensley
versus
eckerhart,
read
together
with
this
court's
decision
in
carey,
established
that
you
have...
that
a
prevailing
party
has
to
overcome
the
statutory
threshold
before
you
ever
get
to
the
question
of
reasonableness.
and
we
contend
that
new
york
gaslight
club
against
carey,
where
the
issue
is
can
you
get
fee
for
state
administrative
proceedings,
establishes
that
the
issue
for
determination
before
anything
else
is
determined
by
the
court
is
whether
those
proceedings
are
actions
or
proceedings
within
the
purview
of
the
federal
civil
rights
attorneys'
fee
act.
and
we
think
that
petitioner's
argument
that
seeks
to
jump
over
to
the
question
of
reasonableness
ignores
this
very
statutory
threshold
question
which
this
court
established
in
new
york
gaslight
club
against
carey.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
no,
we
do
not
think
so,
because
the
prevailing
plaintiff,
the
applicant,
has
not
made
it
over
the
statutory
threshold.
and
the
reason
why
that
is
so
is
because
the
applicant,
the
applicant
has
chosen
to
pursue
an
administrative
remedy
which
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
encourage
resort
to
through
section
1983.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
well,
as
a
general
proposition
it
may
should
be
discoverable.
but
the
question
is
did
congress
intend
by
section
1988
to
authorize
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees
for
what
i
think
stretches
the
point
of
being
an
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
the
enumerated
federal
civil
rights
statutes.
and
that's
our
contention,
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
simply
not
made
it
over
the
statutory
threshold
of
demonstrating
that
these
proceedings
are
in
fact
an
action
or
proceeding
within
the
purview
of
section
1988.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that,
with
that
as
a
general
proposition,
justice.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
well,
yes,
and
i
think
there's
other
references
in
the
legislative
history--
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
--well,
of
course,
one
of
the
problems
that
is
incurred
in
this
type
of
situation
is
that
i
don't
think
you
can
equate
the
relief
sought
in
the
federal
court
with
what
the
county
board
of
education
of
dyer
county,
tennessee,
was
empowered
to
do
with
this
plaintiff's
civil
rights
claim.
the
only
thing
i
think
that
the
dyer
county
board
of
education
was
empowered
to
do
under
tennessee
statute
is
merely
to
reinstate
mr.
webb
and
to
give
him
back
pay.
and
the
only
thing
that
the
county
board
of
education
would
do
would
be
to
judge
the
validity
of
the
charges
leveled
against
mr.
webb.
but
in
mr.
webb's
or
petitioner's
federal
civil
rights
complaint,
he
not
only
seeks
a
claim
of
race
discrimination,
he
presents
a
claim
of
a
million
dollars
in
damages
to
his
reputation
which
he
says
was
incurred
as
part
of
this
dismissal.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
justice
white,
i
certainly
know
of
none.
i
would
tend
to
think
that
if
tennessee
courts
say
that
tennessee
courts
should
not--
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
--entertain
1983
actions,
then
the
fair
inference
would
be
that,
no,
that
administrative
bodies
would
not.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
i
can't
address
that
as
a
general
proposition,
whether
there
is
enabling
legislation
that
says
statewide
all
boards
can.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
no,
sir,
i'm
not
aware
of
those.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
well,
i
certainly
know
that
in
this
particular
case,
from
a
review
of
the
record
even,
although
those
points
were
made,
i
don't
think
they
were
seriously
considered.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
no,
i
did
not.
the
board
was
represented
by
other
counsel.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
i
don't
think
there
was
specific
objection
to
the
argument
of
counsel
concerning
constitutional
claim,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
a
way
to
divide
the
evidence
that
petitioner
submitted.
but
in
any
event,
you
do
run
into
this
problem,
i
think,
of
the
fact
that
the
relief
sought
in
the
federal
court
simply
could
not
have
been
granted
by
the
dyer
county
board
of
education.
i
don't
think
petitioner
would
contend
that
there's
any
way
that
the
county
board
of
education
could
render
a
million
dollar
damage
verdict,
nor
could
it
certify
a
class
action
which
was
sought
in
the
instant
case
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
all
black
children,
all
black
educators
within
the
dyer
county
board
of
education,
within
that
school
system.
so
we
think
the
petitioner
has
simply
not
crossed
that
statutory
threshold.
petitioner's
argument
in
the
alternative
appears
to
be
that
the
word
"proceeding",
which
we
view
as
the
scope
or
threshold
issue,
can
be
construed
to
mean
an
optional
state
administrative
proceeding.
and
petitioner
relies
on
this
court's
decision
in
new
york
gaslight
club
against
carey
for
that
proposition.
we
think
that
if
you
consider...
that
if
the
court
considers
the
way
it
analyzed
the
problem
in
carey,
that
the
opposite
result
should
obtain
in
this
case.
in
respondents'
view,
we
contend
that
the
underlying
rationale
of
new
york
club
against
carey
was
that
the
statute
which
created
the
right
to
attorneys'
fees
also
required
the
petitioner
in
that
case...
or
the
respondent
in
that
case...
to
exhaust
the
state
administrative
remedies.
and
the
underlying
thought
behind
that
was,
if
you
do
not
award
fees
for
these
proceedings
which
the
statute
requires
the
party
to
undergo,
then
the
party
may
decide,
if
he
has
to
pay
his
own
attorney,
he
might
not
advance
what
would
ultimately
be
a
meritorious
civil
rights
claim.
in
this
case
those
considerations
simply
are
not
present.
as
i
think
the
petitioner
has
conceded,
there
is
simply
no
exhaustion
requirement.
there
is
simply
no
part
of
the
costs
that
federal
law
requires
petitioner
to
undergo
in
this
case
in
order
to
vindicate
his
rights
that
was
done
in
the
dyer
county
board
of
education
hearings.
we
would
also
contend
that
this
court's
observation
in
footnote
14
of
smith
versus
robinson,
recently
decided
by
this
court,
supports
this
application
of
carey
in
the
instant
case.
in
that
case
the
court...
and
this
was
cited
in
our
supplemental
brief...
this
court
drew
that
very
distinction
of
carey
and
title
vii
on
the
one
hand
and
section
1988
and
a
1983
claim
which
was
not
required
to
be
exhausted.
and
the
court's
conclusion
in
that
case
was
that,
since
there
was
nothing
in
federal
law
that
required
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
to
pursue
the
administrative
remedies,
then
he
could
have,
just
as
petitioner
could
have
in
this
case,
gone
straight
to
court.
and
we
contend
that
the
new
york
gaslight
club
against
carey
case,
as
most
recently
applied
in
smith
versus
robinson,
supports
the
respondents'
argument
that
congress
did
not
intend
fees
to
be
awarded
under
section
1988
for
optional
state
administrative
proceedings.
further,
as
to
the
legislative
history,
this
court
observed
in
hensley
versus
ekerhart,
the
very
case
upon
which
the
petitioner
relies,
that
the
very
purpose
of
section
1988
is
to
ensure
effective
access
to
the
judicial
process.
and
we
contend
that
this
evidences
this
court's
recognition
that
the
civil
rights
that
are
set
forth
in
section
1988
are
to
be
enforced
primarily
in
court.
patsy
has
held
that
congress
has
not
encouraged
the
use
of
state
administrative
remedies
for
the
enforcement
of
these
rights,
and
therefore
this
court
should
deny
fees
for
optional
state
administrative
proceedings.
we
would
also
emphasize
that
to
leave
lower
courts
with
no
better
guidance
than
what
is
reasonable
to
do
in
situations
such
as
these
will
further
spawn
litigation,
because
these
courts
will
be
making
judgments
concerning
proceedings
that
do
not
occur
before
them,
as
to
the
amount
of
hours,
the
monetary
service...
the
monetary
value
of
the
services,
and
the
impact
of
those
proceedings
on
federal
court
litigation.
and
the
courts
may
have
very
familiarity
with
these
procedures
and
the
procedures
do
not
occur
under
the
auspices
or
the
control
of
the
courts,
and
in
our
view
we
think
that
this
will
spawn
further
litigation
as
to
what
is
reasonable
in
these
particular
cases,
and
it
will
take
up
already
crowded
trial
and
appellate
docket
time
to
litigate
questions
that
are
only
peripherally
related
to
the
vindication
of
the
underlying
civil
rights
act.
mr.
s.
russell
headrick
now,
of
course,
there's
no...
and
there
may
be
some
of
that
disincentive.
but
there's
no
clear
indication,
at
least
from
the
court's
opinion
in
patsy,
that
administrative
remedies
provide
the
swiftest
or
most
accurate
way
to
resolve
these
disputes.
and
as
i've
also
pointed
out,
the
relief
that's
granted
at
the
administrative
level
may
not
be
coextensive
with
the
rights
that
are
sought
to
be
protected
by
the
petitioner,
as
in
this
case.
so
that
even
had
petitioner
prevailed
in
this
case,
he
still
might
have
wound
up
in
federal
court
on
his
damage
to
reputation
claims
and
damage
claims,
as
well
as
injunctive
class
relief.
so
we
think
that
that
proposition
cuts
both
ways
in
this
case
in
particular.
and
in
view
of
the
increased
litigation
over
this
question
of
reasonableness,
we
think
the
balance
should
be
struck
the
other
way.
and
on
balance,
we
would
assert
in
the
respondents'
view
that
denial
of
fees
for
optional
state
administrative
proceedings
in
this
case
would
indeed
provide
lower
courts
and
counsel
with
a
clear
line
of
demarcation
and
a
bright
line
of
demarcation
to
determine
what
services
are
compensable
under
section
1988
and
what
services,
if
the
petitioner
chooses
to
pursue
those
remedies,
for
which
he
must
bear
his
own
counsel
fees.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
that
concludes
my
remarks.
