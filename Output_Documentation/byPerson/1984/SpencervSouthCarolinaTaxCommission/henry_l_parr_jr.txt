mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
not
a
complicated
case.
plain
statutory
language,
legislative
history,
and
holdings
of
this
court
established
the
right
of
the
petitioners,
roger
and
shirley
spencer,
to
the
attorney's
fees
that
they
seek
in
this
case.
this
case
arose
because
the
legislature
of
south
carolina
enacted
an
unconstitutionally
discriminatory
tax
statute.
that
unconstitutional
discrimination
cost
the
spencers
approximately
$500.
fortunately,
congress
had
given
the
spencers
a
remedy
for
this
unconstitutional
violation.
in
section
1983
the
spencers
had
a
federal
cause
of
action,
and
in
1976
congress
had
enacted
what
is
now
section
1988,
giving
the
spencers
the
availability
of
attorney's
fees
to
help
them
remedy
constitutional
deprivations
just
like
this.
the
spencers
decided
to
invoke
their
rights
under
section
1988.
they
brought
this
action.
federal
courts
were
not
readily
available
to
the
spencers
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
principles
of
comity,
and
the
tax
injunction
act,
so
the
spencers
brought
their
case
in
state
court.
they
obtained
the
declaration
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
null
and
void,
and
of
no
further
effect
in
south
carolina.
unfortunately,
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
refused
to
grant
the
spencers
the
attorney's
fees--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--they
brought
an
action
under
section
1983
and
under
the
constitution
itself.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
they
invoked
section
12-47-220.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
it
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
i
don't
think
it
creates
a
cause
of
action
itself.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
that
is
correct.
unfortunately,
the
trial
judge
did
not
recognize
his
obligation
to
enforce
federal
law
and
refused
to
consider
the
spencers'
request
for
attorney's
fees
because
he
believed
that
he
must
follow
the
state
law
which
did
not
provide
for
attorney's
fees
in
this
case.
he
noted,
however,
that
the
spencers
had
obtained
only
a
tasteless
victory,
because
he
took
notice
of
the
substantial
amount
of
work
that
had
been
devoted
to
the
case
and
the
substantial
expense
that
the
spencers
must
have
incurred.
there
is
really
no
question
that
under
the
supremacy
clause,
1988
and
1983
are
as
much
the
law
of
the
land
in
south
carolina
state
courts
as
they
are
in
the
federal
courts.
this
court
has
made
that
clear
in
testa
v.
katt
and
numerous
other
opinions.
there
is
really
no
legitimate
distinction
between--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
congress
intended
for
those
rules
to
apply
in
federal
courts...
state
courts.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
question.
in
testa
v.
katt
and
in
mondou
this
court
relied
on
the
existence
of
jurisdiction
to
create
an
implication
of
an
obligation
to
exercise
this.
it
is
true
that
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
in
mondou,
congress
had
acknowledged
that
state
courts
had
concurrent
jurisdiction;
but
in
mondou
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
congress
had
not
attempted
to
order
state
courts
to
enforce
that
act.
this
court
declared
that
the
existence
of
jurisdiction
creates
an
obligation
to
exercise
that.
even
if
it
were
important
to
look
into
congress'
intent,
it
is
very
clear
that
until
the
amount
requirement
was
eliminated
in
federal
question
cases,
there
was
a
large
category
of
1983
actions
that
could
only
be
brought
in
state
courts.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
it
means
that
when
a
court
has
the
judicial
power
to
enforce
a
law
and
the
law
is
applicable
in
that
court's
domain,
the
court
must
enforce
that
law
under
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
if
congress
intended
to
give
the
federal
courts
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
a
cause
of
action,
the
state
courts
would
not
have
the
obligation
or
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
law.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
it
is
conceivable
that
congress
might
have
had
that
intent,
except
that
i
don't
think
congress
would
have
enacted
section
1983
and
left
a
whole
class
of
those
cases
without
any
forum
in
which
they
could
be
brought.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
i
will
concede
that
if
congress
specifically
said
we
do
not
intend
for
state
courts
to
have
to
enforce
this
law,
that
the
supremacy
clause
would
not
require
them
to
do
so.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
i
think
it
would
require
a
very
clear
showing
of
congressional
intent,
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
extensive
debate
on
section
1
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act
which
indicates
that.
in
fact,
this
court
has
noted
several
times
that
members
of
congress
who
enacted
section
1983
anticipated
enforcement
in
state
courts.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
i'm
arguing,
your
honor,
just
as
this
court
declared
in
maine
v.
thiboutot,
that
section
1988
attorney's
fees
are
part
of
the
remedies
available
under
section
1983,
and
they
come
as
one
package.
and
that
the
attorney's
fees
part
of
section
1988
is
a
very
important
part.
congress
made
it
very
clear
when
it
enacted
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
act
that
it
wanted
to
encourage
people
to
vindicate
their
constitutional
rights,
and
that
congress
had
determined
that
many
people
would
be
unable
to
do
so
without
the
availability
of
attorney's
fees.
congress
also
made
it
clear
that
it
expected
in
many
cases
those
attorney's
fees
to
come
from
the
states.
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
case
that
we
have
today.
it's
very
clear
that
congress'
intent
was
for
people
like
the
spencers
to
have
attorney's
fees
available
to
them
so
that
they
would
be
able
to
vindicate
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
it
can
do
so
when
its
refusal
to
entertain
the
claim
does
not
frustrate
congress'
policy.
as
this
court
recognized
in
herb
v.
pitcairn,
a
court
can
apply
a
forum
nonconvenience
doctrine,
or
a
court
can
say
i
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
claims
that
have
been
brought
outside
of
the
city.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
that
is
a
very
subtle
question
which
this
court
has
yet
to
address
and,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
need
not
address
in
this
case,
and
not
in
a
category
of
cases
like
this
in
south
carolina,
because
the
state
court
in
south
carolina
has
said
exhaustion
is
not
required
in
tax
cases
when
only
constitutional
and
legal
issues
are
involved.
but--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--in
the
other
cases
this
court
would
have
to
look
very
carefully
at
the
considerations
that
led
to
its
opinion
in
patsy
requiring
exhaustion
in
federal
courts
to
see
if
those
same
considerations
apply
in
state
courts.
i
think
this
court
would
also
have
to
look
very
carefully
at
the
considerations
justice
brennan
noted
in
his
concurring
opinions
in
mcnerey
to
see
if
those
same
considerations
apply
to
tax
cases
under
1988
in
state
courts.
and
then
the
court
would--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--it
could
be,
but
if
it
were
imposed
in
a
way
to
frustrate
the
intent
of
congress,
i
don't
think
that
the
supremacy
clause
would
allow
a
state
to
do
that.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
i
don't
think
a
state
court
could
do
that
in
a
way
that
would
frustrate
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
you
would
have
to
have
a
particular
case
in
front
of
you.
in
this
case
we
have
section
1988
which
says
that
the
spencers
are
entitled
to
attorney's
fees
to
encourage
them
to
vindicate
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
statute--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does
have
that
kind
of
rule.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
well,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
has
said
that
the
statute
prohibiting
injunctions
is
not
enforceable
unless
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
because
the
constitution
of
south
carolina
gives
the
circuit
courts
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
if
there
were
a
conflict
between
1983
and
the
anti-injunction
act
passed
by
the
state
legislature,
1983
would
prevail.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
will
not
be
any
opportunities
for
increased
injunctions
in
cases
like
this
under
section
1983.
this
court
has
made
very
clear
in
l.a.
v.
madrano,
in
pizzo
v.
goode
that
normal
equitable
principles
apply
in
1983
actions.
so
when
a
taxpayer
comes
into
state
courts
under
1983,
in
south
carolina
or
anywhere
else,
he
will
have
to
show
that
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
at
law
before
he
can
get
an
injunction
enjoining
the
collection
of
state
taxes.
since
most
states
provide
refund
actions
that--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--declaratory--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--in
that
case
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
bound
by
equitable
principles
as
well
if
they
didn't
also
follow
the
refund
system
provided
by
state
law.
and
the
state
courts
would
apply
normal
principles
of
equity
to
determine
whether
a
declaratory
judgment
was
proper
in
that
case.
but
i
do
not
think
a
state
statute
could
override
section
1983...
testa
makes
that
very
clear...
because
the
laws
of
congress
are
supreme.
the
respondents
say
that
the
tax
injunction
act
has
modified
section
1983
in
this
case
and
deprived
the
spencers
of
their
section
1983
cause
of
action.
however,
the
legislative
history
of
the
tax
injunction
act
shows
that
the
respondent's
argument
is
wrong.
senator
bone,
the
proponent
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
described
it
to
congress
as
a
very
short
bill
affecting
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
courts.
in
the
congressional
record
each
time
the
bill
was
presented
to
congress,
it
was
described
as
a
bill
to
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts.
the
debate
on
that
section
was
very
limited.
there's
no
indication
that
anybody
in
congress
thought
they
were
depriving
any
taxpayer
of
any
federal
cause
of
action.
the
statute
itself
says
that
the
federal
courts
shall
not
have
jurisdiction
when
a
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedy
may
be
had
in
the
courts
of
the
state.
it
does
not
say
when
a
remedy
may
be
had
under
state
law.
senator
bone
said
that
the
statute
would
not
deprive
any
taxpayer
of
any
equitable
right
or
his
day
in
court.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
i
think
that
the
rule
of
testa
v.
katt
would
have
made
their
argument
erroneous,
because
it
would
have
been
clear
that
the
state
courts
were
obligated
to
enforce
the
federal
law.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
would
have
made
the
state
enforce
section
1988,
and
therefore,
there
would
have
been
a
remedy
available
in
state
courts.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
and
i
would
say
likewise,
if
for
some
reason
the
state
courts
were
not
obligated--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--i
would
say
that,
mr.
justice
white.
congress
has
determined
that
when
constitutional
rights
are
at
stake,
attorney's
fees
should
be
available.
this
court
addressed
a
similar
argument
in
rosewell.
in
that
case
the
taxpayer
said
i
cannot
get
interest,
and
i'm
entitled
to
interest
under
federal
law.
this
court
said
that
the
taxpayers
could
not
proceed
in
federal
court
because
it
knew
that
the
state
courts
in
that
case
would
consider
any
federal
claim
to
interest.
here,
the
petitioners,
the
taxpayers,
have
a
federal
claim
to
attorney's
fees;
and
therefore,
if
the
state
does
not
make
that
available,
i
think
the
remedy
would
be
inadequate
under
the
tax
injunction
act.
as
i
repeat,
as
i
said
earlier,
there
is
no
risk
of
increased
injunctions
in
this
case
if
the
spencers
prevail.
normal
equitable
principles
govern
the
availability
of
injunctive
relief
in
tax
cases
in
south
carolina
now,
and
they
will
even
if
section
1983
is
made
available.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
taxpayers
will
be
able
to
totally
disrupt
state
tax
systems
by
using
1983
to
circumvent
administrative
remedies.
if
congress
decides
that
that
is
a
problem,
this
congress
can
remedy
that
problem,
as
it
did
in
the
civil
rights
of
institutionalized
persons
act,
which
this
court
noted
in
its
opinion
in
patsy.
furthermore,
this
court
has
never
held
that
exhaustion
does
not
apply
in
1983
actions
in
state
court
in
tax
cases.
that
is
an
issue
that
the
court
would
have
to
address
at
a
proper
time.
if
exhaustion
is
advisable,
the
court
can
simply
decree
in
the
proper
case
at
the
proper
time
that
exhaustion
is
required
under
congressional
intent
and
the
principles
which
govern
exhaustion.
that
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
spencers
complied
with
the
state
law
and
the
state
procedures.
they
brought
their
case
in
state
court
so
that
they
could
get
the
most
reliable
reading
of
state
law.
they
vindicated
their
constitutional
rights,
and
although
it's
not
in
the
record,
anyone
else
who
was
affected
by
this
statute.
their
victory
turned
out
to
be
tasteless
because
the
state
court
refused
to
enforce
federal
laws.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
yes,
you
would,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
maher
v.
gagne
when
it
cited
the
house
report
on
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
act,
when
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
that
would
justify
federal
jurisdiction
under--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
congress
tried
to
accommodate
that
principle
to
the
extent
that
it
could
and
also
accomplish
what
it
wanted
to
accomplish.
the
house
report
said
that
we
understand
that
federal
courts
try
to
avoid
constitutional
issues,
so
courts
need
only
look
to
see
if
they
were
substantial.
they
need
not
resolve
them
in
order
to
determine--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--that
is.
it's
based
on
the
house
report
and
this
court's
decision
in
maher
v.
gagne.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
there
has
been
no
exercise
of
discretion
in
the
courts
below,
but
the
rule,
as
this
court
has
acknowledged,
is
that
attorney's
fees
are
normally
available
unless
it
would
be
unjust
to
award
them.
this
court
has
acknowledged
that
maher
v.
gagne.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
our
position
is
the
discretion
is
very
limited
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
any
unjustness
in
awarding
attorney's
fees
to
the
spencers
in
this
case.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
south
carolina
law
would
not
give
us
any
attorney's
fees
at
all
because
it
follows
the
american
rule
regarding
attorney's
fees
which
congress--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--i
know
of
no
such
limitation,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
--i
don't
think
they
were
thinking
about
banks,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
they
were
thinking
about
people,
individuals
whose
constitutional
rights
had
been
deprived,
and
that
is
who
is
before
the
court
today.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
do
have
just
a
few
comments
to
make.
in
response
to
your
questions,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
trial
court,
as
noted
in
its
opinion
on
page
18-a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
stated
that
plaintiffs
have
consolidated
actions
under
12-47-220
of
the
south
carolina
code
and
an
action
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
and
1988.
so
the
trial
court
in
this
case
did
recognize
that
it
had
a
1983
action
before
it.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
it
did
not
address
it.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
supreme
court
said
the
trial
court
did
not
address
the
section
1983
claim.
the
supreme
court
did
this
not
because
of
any
analysis
of
testa
v.
katt
or
the
supremacy
clause.
it
simply
noted
that
this
court
had
not
yet
ruled
on
that
precise
issue.
in
response
to
the
respondent's
contention
that
this
is
not
a
section
1983
case,
congress
has
clearly
made
section
1983
available
when
there
are
deprivations
of
constitutional
rights.
i
don't
think
congress
should
be
required
to
make
a
specific
list
of
all
the
possible
deprivations
of
constitutional
rights.
1983
could
not
be
any
more
clear.
also,
as
this
court
noted
in
maine
v.
thiboutot,
congress
intended
for
fees
to
be
available
in
state
courts.
this
court
pointed
out
that
if
fees
were
not
available
in
state
courts,
federalism
concerns
would
be
raised,
because
there
are
1983
cases
which
cannot
be
brought
into
federal
courts,
and
those
1983
plaintiffs
would
be
forced
to
come
into
state
court
without
the
attorney's
fees
that
congress
meant
for
those
plaintiffs
to
have.
the
respondents
have
attempted
to
expand
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
tax
injunction
act
far
beyond
what
the
legislative
history
indicates.
the
tax
injunction
act
is
not
like
the
statutes
the
court
faced
in
sea
clammers
and
smith
v.
robinson.
it
is
a
very
short
bill.
it
had
only
one
purpose,
and
that
was
to
deprive
federal
district
courts
of
jurisdiction
in
certain
kinds
of
cases
under
certain
circumstances.
congress
was
not
trying
to
create
a
comprehensive
remedial
scheme.
our
arguments
regarding
injunctions
not
being
available
in
state
court
any
more
than
they
already
are
are
based
on
section
1983.
congress
has
not
attempted
to
alter
the
equitable
principles
which
governed
the
availability
of
injunctive
relief.
therefore,
if
1983
actions
are
available
in
state
court,
those
same
principles
will
apply.
exhaustion
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
although
respondents
have
fears
of
exhaustion
and
circumvention
of
state
remedies,
that
is
not
the
question
before
the
court.
there
was
no
failure
to
exhaust
here.
the
court
can
address
that
in
a
future
case.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
i
think
that
is
what
the
respondents
have
said.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
has
said
that
1983
is
not
available
whenever
it
supplements
the
remedies
that
are
available
under
state
law,
which
would
render
1983
redundant
in
most
cases,
and
deprive
people
like
the
spencers
of
the
attorney's
fees
that
congress
meant
for
the
spencers
to
have.
the
respondents
have
raised
an
issue
of
sovereign
immunity.
this
court
has
ruled
in
hutto
v.
finney
that
there
is
no
sovereign
immunity
problem
regarding
the
availability
of
attorney's
fees.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
that's
right.
including
people
like
the
spencers,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
monroe
v.
pape.
and
the
issues
regarding
whether
sovereign
immunity
had
been
pierced
by
section
1983
are
not
really
in
this
case.
the
spencers
obtained
a
declaratory
judgment
despite
the
state's
argument
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
the
state
supreme
court
in
this
case
affirmed
a
declaration
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
as
this
court
noted
in
pullian
v.
allen,
congress
clearly
meant
for
people
like
the
spencers
to
have
attorney's
fees,
even
though
some
doctrine
of
immunity
might
bar
damages
relief
or
other
types
of
relief.
if
there
are
no...
oh,
i
would
like
to
address
one
further
point.
in
cases
where
congress'
intent
is
unclear
about
the
obligation
of
state
courts,
testa
makes
the
rule
clear.
in
testa
v.
katt
and
mondou
there
was
no
specific
ruling,
by
congress
of
whether
the
state
courts
were
required
to
enforce
the
federal
statutes.
this
court
ruled
in
both
cases
that
the
supremacy
clause
answered
the
question
in
those
cases
and
required
the
state
court
to
enforce
them.
the
refusal
to
enforce
the
spencers'
federal
rights
in
this
case
is
not
based
on
a
lack
of
jurisdiction.
it
is
based
on
state
policy.
the
supremacy
clause
does
not
permit
the
legislature
of
south
carolina
to
instruct
its
courts
to
award
only
the
remedies
that
the
state
legislature
wishes
plaintiffs
to
have.
mr.
henry
l.
parr,
jr.
my
argument
is
not
based
on
discernible
intent
to
require
states
to
entertain
them.
my
argument
is
based
on
congress,
intent
that
1983
actions
be
available
in
state
courts,
and
then
applying
the
rule
of
testa
that
when
congress
has
given
state
courts
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
a
federal
cause
of
action,
without
making
any
sore
findings
state
courts
are
obligated
to
enforce
those
federal
causes
of
action.
that
is
a
well-established
principle,
and
i
think
congress
follows
it
when
it
enacts
federal
causes
of
action.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
