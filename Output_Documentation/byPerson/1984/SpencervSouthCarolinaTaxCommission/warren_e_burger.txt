mr.
parr,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
well,
are
you
arguing,
mr.
parr,
that
section
1988
is
the
tail
of
1983
that
follows
the
dog
when
it
goes
into
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
south
carolina
have
any
limitation
that
the
attorney's
fee
award
can't
be
any
higher
than
the
award
in
the
lawsuit
itself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
i
mean
that
you
don't
mean
in
this
situation
generally
is
there
any
south
carolina
limitation
on
attorney's
fees
when
they
are
allowed
in
other--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
stevens.
chief
justice
burger
well,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
state
court
did
acknowledge
this
as
a
1983
action
as
part
of
its
conclusion?
chief
justice
burger
well,
what
did
the
trial
court
think
it
was
doing?
chief
justice
burger
and
not
1983?
chief
justice
burger
yes,
yes.
well,
will
you...
in
response
to
my
question
to
mr.
parr,
i
said...
and
i'll
ask
you
now...
do
you
think
when
1983
is
in
the
state
court,
1988
does
not
follow
it?
chief
justice
burger
you're
saying
then
that
1983
wasn't
in
the
state
court
here.
chief
justice
burger
but
the
court
of...
what
did
the
state
supreme
court
say
about
that?
chief
justice
burger
that
is
true
in
a
great
many
1983
cases
where
the
attorney's
fees
vastly
exceed
what's
involved
economically;
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
parr?
chief
justice
burger
if
i
understood
your
friend
correctly,
he
suggested...
and
maybe
i
didn't
understand
him
correctly...
that
1983
actions
in
the
state
courts
are
in
the
category
of
cases
that
the
state
court
can
take
or
leave.
they
can
enforce
1983
or
they
can
refuse
to
do
it.
chief
justice
burger
well,
as
justice
marshall
suggested,
probably
congress
in
enacting
1983
wasn't
thinking
about
banks
and
bankers
so
much
as
it
was
thinking
about
some
other
people.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
mitchell
against
forsyth.
