justice
blackmun
mr.
parr,
if
you
prevail
here,
are
you
assured
of
getting
attorney's
fees?
justice
blackmun
there
is
an
element
of
discretion
so
that
you
might
win
now
and
still
not
get
fees
ultimately,
i
suppose.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--well,
of
course,
if
you
knock
a
statute
out
which
reaches
far
longer
than
the
spencers.
