justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
scope
of
your
position?
the
statutory
language
doesn't
say
they
must
allow
fees;
it
says
they
may
allow
fees,
as
i
remember
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
your
position;
that
any
time
you
make
a
1983
claim,
and
that
supposing
the
court
could
grant
relief
to
your
client
on
state
law
grounds
alone
without
reaching
the
constitutional
issue,
would
you
be
entitled
to
fees
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
in
every
case
in
which
you've
got
two
alternative
theories...
one,
a
state
law
claim
that
would
not
require
reaching
a
constitutional
issue,
and
also
a
federal
constitutional
claim...
that
it
becomes
the
duty
of
the
trial
judge
to
make
at
least
a
summary
appraisal
of
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
issue
in
order
to
decide
whether
you're
entitled
to
fees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
congress,
in
effect,
has
reversed
one
of
our
principles
of
constitutional
adjudication,
that
we
try
to
avoid
constitutional
issues
whenever
we
can,
and
says
in
every
case
when
one
is
raised,
you
at
least
give
a
tentative
appraisal
of
the
merits
of
the
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
and
not
only
federal
courts
but
state
courts
must
always
take
a
good,
hard
look
at
the
federal
constitutional
claim,
even
though
it's
perfectly
clear
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
you
might
have
prevailed
under
your
state
constitution.
i
don't
know
if
you
could
have
in
this
case.
but
that's
basically
your
position.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you--
justice
stevens
--i
don't
know
if
the
complaint
is
in
the
papers
before
us
or
not,
but
were
there
separate
counts
when
the
complaint
was
filed,
one
based
on
1983
and
another
on
georgia
provisions?
justice
stevens
did
the
factual
allegations
in
the
1983
count
differ
in
any
respect
from
those
on
which
the
court
granted
relief?
it
seems
to
me
that
sometimes
these
things
are
kind
of
formalistic.
they
basically
made
a
federal
constitutional
claim
in
more
than
one
count.
justice
stevens
one
of
which
was
a
1983
count,
and
another
was
a
georgia--
justice
stevens
--i
mean
a
south
carolina--
