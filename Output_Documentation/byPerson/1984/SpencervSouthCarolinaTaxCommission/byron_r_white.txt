what
kind
of
an
action
did
they
bring?
justice
white
and
did
they
purport
to
bring
an
action
under
state
law?
justice
white
which
is
what
kind
of
an
action?
justice
white
but
is
it
a
refund?
did
they
want
a
refund
of
taxes?
justice
white
that's
really
the
state's
remedy,
to
sue
for
a
refund,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
as
part
of
that
your
refund
was
going
to
be
based
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
law.
justice
white
south
carolina
has
that
type
of
rule,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
sure.
all
you
can
do
is
either...
if
you're
going
to
pay
the
tax,
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
sue
for
a
refund.
justice
white
what
about
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
white
do
you
think
that
a
taxpayer
just
couldn't
come
in
and
say...
the
spencers
couldn't
have
come
in
and
just
brought
an
action
under
state
law
to
say
i
want
a
declaratory
judgment
that
this
tax
provision
is
unconstitutional,
because
i
don't
want
them
to
be
collecting
it
from
me
any
more.
justice
white
and
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
if
the
spencers
had
gone
into
federal
court
under
1983
they
could
have
successfully
claimed
that
they
should
be
in
federal
court
because
the
remedy
in
south
carolina
was
insufficient
because
it
didn't
allow
attorney's
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
testa
against
katt
would
have
made
the
state...
would
have
made
the
state
give
attorney's
fees,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
just
assumes
you're
right
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
think
that
just
per
se
that
the
unavailability
of
attorney's
fees
in
a
state
remedy
would
just
make
that
remedy
inadequate
for
purposes
of
the
tax
injunction
act?
justice
white
do
you
think
south
carolina
in
this
case
could
have...
say
the
south
carolina,
court
said
well,
we
understand
you're
alleging
a
violation
of
the
constitution
as
part
of
your
suit
for
a
refund,
but
we
just
don't
entertain
federal
constitutional
claims
in
our
courts.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
would
they...
why
couldn't
they
have
said
that,
which
would
have
meant
the
remedy
was
inadequate,
and
the
taxpayers
go
to
federal
court?
do
you
think
he
could
have...
the
taxpayer
could
have
said
you
must
hear
my
constitutional
claim;
i'm
not
asking
you
to
hear
it
under
1983;
i
just
insist
you
hear
it
as
part
of
my
refund
claim.
do
you
think
that
south
carolina
court
would
have
had
to
have
heard
it?
justice
white
well,
at
least
your
submission
certainly
is
that
south
carolina
entertains
constitutional
claims
all
the
time.
justice
white
as
part
of
the
refund
claim.
justice
white
you
say
that
as
long
as
south
carolina
doesn't
turn
down
federal
constitutional
claims,
it
may
decide
just
not
to
award
attorney's
fees.
justice
white
or
in
any
other
instance
that
the
legislature...
if
the
south
carolina
legislature
says
in
no
case...
everybody
pays
his
own
attorney's
fees,
no
fee
shifting
at
all
in
any
case,
you
would
say
that
should
go
for
federal
constitutional
claims
as
well.
justice
white
so
you
think
the
policy
and
indeed
the
content
of
the
anti-injunction
act
just
ought
to
be
applied
to
the
1983
remedy
in
state
courts?
it
just
shouldn't
be
available.
justice
white
what
remedy
short...
if
you
don't
want
to
pay...
is
there
an
administrative
remedy
if
you
don't
want
to
pay
your
tax
first?
can
you
go
to
a
tax
court
or
something,
or
a
commission?
justice
white
and
keep
your
taxes
unless
you
lose.
justice
white
so
for
all
practical
purposes,
there's
only
one
remedy
really:
pay
and
sue.
justice
white
that's
an
administrative--
justice
white
--and
if
you
get
it
turned
down,
then
you
bring
your
suit
for
a
refund.
justice
white
but
it
didn't
address
it.
justice
white
or
decide...
or
purport
to
decide
under
it.
