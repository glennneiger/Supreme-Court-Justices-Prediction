mr.
ray
n.
stevens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
great
deal
of
the
court's
attention
thus
far
has
been
focused
on
exactly
what
south
carolina's
courts
did
not
do.
i
think
it
is
a
very
important
part
of
this
case
to
look
at
exactly
what
south
carolina's
courts
did
do.
and
what
they
have
done
is
that
they
have
vindicated
the
federal
rights
of
a
citizen
of
this
country
and
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
we
think
that
is
all
that
the
constitution
of
this
country
requires.
furthermore,
we
think
that
is
all
that
congress
has
required.
what
we
have
in
this
instance
is
a
taxpayer
who
is
essentially
arguing
that
the
constitution
gives
him
the
authority
to
take
a
1983
case
into
the
state
courts
and
obtain
a
tax
refund.
that
is
just
incorrect.
the
authority
for
that
position
is
given
as
a
supremacy
clause.
well,
this
court
has
held
that
the
supremacy
clause
itself
does
not
grant
rights.
what
it
does
is
that
it
secures
rights
which
the
constitution
otherwise
grants
or
that
congress
has
granted.
in
this
instance
the
court
on
analogous
cases
has
found
that
the
supremacy
clause
should
not
be
given
the
broad,
expansive
reading
that
the
taxpayer
does
here.
and
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
show
various
instances
in
which
a
state
court
has
declined
to
receive
a
federal
claim,
and
that
this
court
has
found
those
actions
to
be
proper.
the
cases
that
seem
to
be
most
telling
are
those
of
douglas
v.
new
york,
herb
v.
pitcairn,
and
missouri
ex
rel
southern
railway
v.
mayfield.
the
last
case
cited
in
particular
says
that
the
doctrine
of
forum
nonconvenience,
which
is
purely
one
that
the
state
had
adopted
at
its
convenience
for
the
parties,
is
one
that
the
state
may
use
and
refuse
to
hear
a
federal
cause
of
action.
we
think
that
in
this
instance
the
supremacy
clause
would
not
demand
that
the
state
of
south
carolina
entertain
the
1983
action.
the
question
that
must
be
asked
is
does
the
state
rule
that
is
being
applied,
is
it
applied
neutrally,
or
does
it
single
out
federal
causes
of
action
and
prohibit
the
state
from
hearing
those?
we
think
that
the
correct
application
of
that
rule
in
south
carolina
is
that
we
have
a
neutral
rule.
the
neutral
rule
that
we
use
is
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
our
own
courts.
our
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
tax
matters
only
in
those
instances
in
which
the
taxpayer
brings
an
action
paid
under
protest
and
then
sues
within
30
days
to
recover
his
money.
that
is
not
an
unusual
position.
this
court
has
recognized
such
an
argument
in
the
case
of
testa
v.
katt
and
mondou
v.
new
york.
in
those
particular
cases
this
court
has
said
that
the
federal
claim
need
not
be
heard
unless
its
ordinary
jurisdiction
as
prescribed
by
local
law
is
appropriate
to
the
occasion.
well,
what
is
the
ordinary
jurisdiction
in
south
carolina
which
is
appropriate
to
the
occasion?
well,
here
our
courts
have
held
in
at
least
three
specific
cases
that
if
the
courts
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
declaratory
judgments,
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
injunctive
relief;
it
has
jurisdiction
only
over
those
cases
where
there
is
a
payment
under
protest,
and
an
action
is
brought
to
recover.
so
in
this
instance
we
think
south
carolina
has
applied
a
very
neutral
rule.
it
excludes
all
state
actions,
and
it
likewise
would
exclude
all
federal
actions.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
reason
there
was
a
payment
under
protest
is
that
was
the
taxpayer's
choice.
he
chose
to
use
a
state
remedy
to
get
into
court,
and
that
is
what
our
court
heard
his
claim
under,
a
pure
state
remedy.
he
also
filed,
along
with
his
state
remedy,
the
1983
remedy.
it
is
that
remedy
that
our
court
would
not
have
taken
jurisdiction
over
had
it
come
in
solely
by
itself.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
your
honor,
that
point
is
well
taken.
if
congress
had
said
that,
then
the
state
courts
would
not
have
any
discretion.
the
matter
would
be
heard
in
the
state
of
south
carolina.
but
that
is
a
critical
question
for
this
court,
and
the
question
is
has
congress
decided
the
states
must
hear
1983
actions.
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
they
have
not.
the
question
is
not
can
they;
the
question
is
have
they
done
it.
well,
in
this
particular
instance,
the
first
thing
that
we
look
at
is
the
literal
language
of
1983.
well,
on
the
face
of
that
statute,
it
does
not
say
that
one
must
hear
these
actions
in
state
court.
so
after
having
reviewed
the
literal
action,
then
we
would
next
proceed
to
the
legislative
history
and
decide
if
there
is
anything
in
that
history
that
would
lead
one
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
required
states
to
hear
1983
actions,
and
especially
those
involving
state
tax
disputes.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
the
opinion
of
our
south
carolina
supreme
court
does
not
expressly
answer
that
question.
the
claim,
the
complaint
that
was
filed
does
allege
the
1983
remedy.
our
courts--
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
--the
trial
court
thought
that
it
was
giving
relief
under
the
payment
under
protest
provision
of
12-47-220.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
and
not
1983,
no,
sir.
it
has
been
our
contention
from
the
beginning
of
the
case
that
the
courts
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
1983.
after
having
reviewed
the
legislative...
the
mere
language
of
the
statute,
we
looked
at
the
legislative
history.
this
court
has
delved
into
the
legislative
history
on
several
occasions,
monroe
v.
pape
being
a
fairly
thorough
undergoing
of
1983's
legislative
history.
one
of
the
primary
purposes
that
this
court
found
that
monroe
v.
pape
said
that
1983
was
enacted
for
was
to
provide
a
federal
remedy
in
a
federal
court.
well,
the
legislative
history
was
again
looked
into
in
the
case
of
patsy
v.
the
board
of
regents
of
the
state
of
florida.
in
this
case
again
this
court
found
numerous
reasons
for
deciding
that
there
was
sufficient
congressional
intent
for
a
federal
remedy.
and,
in
fact,
one
of
the
reasons
this
court
found
was
that
1983
was
designed
to
throw
open
the
doors
of
the
united
states
courts.
well,
we
surmise
from
that
sort
of
legislative
history
that
congress
was
looking
to
intending
a
federal
remedy
in
a
federal
court.
it
was
not
intending
to
make
1983
mandatory
in
the
state
court.
and,
in
fact,
this
court,
after
some--
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
--your
honor,
they
could
not
have
said
that
and
survived
constitutional
muster.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
they
would
have
had
to
have
heard
it
if
he
had
satisfied
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
the
state
and
12-47-220,
the
south
carolina--
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
that's
exactly
right.
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
rosewell,
that
is
one
of
the...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
probably
the
criteria
for
determining
if
a
state
has
an
adequate
remedy;
that
is,
does
the
state
allow
the
taxpayer
to
present
any
and
all
constitutional
claims
that
he
thinks
he's
entitled
to.
well,
if
a
state
does
that,
their
remedy
is
adequate.
that
is
exactly
what
south
carolina
does.
and,
in
fact,
in
this
very
case
additional
constitutional
claims
were
raised...
equal
protection,
right
to
travel,
privileges
and
immunities.
all
of
them
were
heard
in
the
south
carolina
court.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
yes,
sir,
in
this
instance,
until--
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
--yes,
sir,
until
congress
directs
otherwise.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
your
honor,
my
position
would
be
that
if
1983
comes
into
the
state
court,
1988
does
follow
it.
and
your--
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
--that's
correct.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
the
state
supreme
court
said
that
1983
was,
as
i
recall
the
decision,
was
in
the
complaint
but
that
it
did
not
hear
the
complaint
because
it
already
had
given
a
remedy
under
the
state
statute,
and
its
language
was
not
all
that
specific.
but
it
is
our
understanding
the
reason
the
court
did
not
give
it
is
for
jurisdictional
reasons
as
well
as
the
fact
that
the
state
had
an
adequate
remedy.
your
honor,
your
analogy
made
earlier
about
the
1983
dog
with
the
tail
of
1988,
when
these
matters
are
brought
into
state
courts
for
state
taxes,
we
have
much
the
situation
of
the
1988
tail
wagging
the
1983
dog.
in
our
courts
we
have
an
adequate
remedy--
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
--that
is
so,
your
honor.
but
my
point
in
this
instance
is
that
in
those
instances,
congress
has
decided
that
those
states
or
those
matters
need
be
heard,
but
in
this
case
our
question
has
congress
decided
these
things
must
be
heard
in
the
state
courts.
one
reason
for
finding
that
it
need
not
be
heard
in
state
court
is
that
we
already
have
a
remedy,
and
it
is
a
remedy
that
congress
has
recognized.
what
we
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
in
this
title
28
united
states
code
1341,
more
commonly
known
as
the
anti-injunction
statute,
congress
recognized
that
states
had
a
rather
elaborate
and
vast
system
of
handling
state
tax
disputes.
in
that
system
payment
under
protest
was
the
primary
vehicle
for
returning
state
taxes
to
the
taxpayer.
in
addition
to
that,
the
congress
recognized
that
states
required
exhaustion
of
administration
remedies
before
they
could
proceed
to
court.
in
a
similar
type
of
atmosphere,
this
court
in
smith
v.
robinson
and
in
middlesex
v.
sea
clammers
has
found
that
where
congress
knew
of
a
particular
remedy,
there
is
an
intent
that
congress
wanted
that
remedy
to
be
used,
and
that
1983
not
necessarily
be
the
remedy
that
the
individual
could
pursue.
we
think
a
similar
approach
is
warranted
in
this
instance.
since
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
states'
remedies,
it
recognized
those
remedies,
and
therefore,
there
is
an
intent
for
congress
to
say
that
the
1983
remedy
was
not
required
to
be
used
in
state
tax
disputes.
further
pursuing
that
line
of
argument,
for
a
moment
let's
look
at
what
might
happen
if
1983
is
allowed
into
the
state
tax
system.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
violence
to
the
very
purposes
for
which
28
u.s.c.
1341
was
enacted.
the
purpose
behind
1341
was
to
prohibit
the
disruption
of
state
and
county
finances.
and,
in
fact,
what
was
happening
was
that
foreign
corporations
would
be
able
to
establish
diversity
jurisdiction,
thereby
entering
into
federal
court,
obtain
an
injunction,
and
would,
in
effect,
be
litigating
with
the
state
on
the
basis
of
injunctions.
the
corporation
would
not
have
to
pay
the
taxes
up
front,
and
the
state
would
be
denied
the
use
of
the
revenues
during
the
entire
time
of
the
process.
well,
some
of
the
very
large
corporations
in
fact,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
were
sort
of
holding
the
states
hostage.
they
were
using
this
as
a
weapon
to
compromise
the
amount
of
the
tax.
well,
if
1983
is
now
available
in
the
state
court
for
state
taxes,
the
same
result
can
occur.
he
may
came
into
state
court,
simply
say
i
do
not
wish
to
pay
the
tax
on
various
constitutional
grounds,
and
then
obtain
an
injunction
from
the
state
court.
the
taxpayers
say
well,
he
could
not
get
an
injunction.
well,
to
me
that's
a
rather
anomalous
argument.
on
one
hand
he
is
saying
to
the
court
i
don't
have
to
recognize
the
existence
of
adequate
state
remedies
when
i
come
into
court
under
1983,
but
once
i
am
in
the
court
under
1983,
i
recognize
that
i
cannot
get
an
injunction
because
there's
an
adequate
state
remedy.
that
seems
somewhat
circular
to
me.
if
he
comes
into
court
under
1993,
he
brings
in
all
of
the
attributes
of
1983.
the
very
language
of
the
statute
says
that
it
may
be
filed
in
suits
of
equity
as
well
as
it
law.
if
he
can
file
them
in
equity,
then
he
is
able
to
obtain
injunctions
in
the
state
court.
so
he
will
be
defeating
the
very
purpose
for
which
1341
was
enacted.
secondly,
under
1341
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
need
for
states
to
have
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies--
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
--your
honor,
that
is
correct,
because
the
question
before
the
court
is
did
congress
require
1983.
well,
if
the
intent
of
congress
is
expressed
in
1341,
to
prevent
the
very
things
that
1983
can
be
used
for
in
the
state
court,
that
negates
any
sort
of
intent
that
congress
required
states
to
hear
these
actions
in
their
own
courts.
the
administrative
exhaustion
remedy
would
do
great
violence
to
states.
many
times
taxes
are
resolved,
disputes
are
resolved
before
proceeding
to
the
courts
due
to
administration
exhaustion
requirements.
well,
as
this
court
has
found
in
patsy,
the
administration,
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
need
not
be
pursued.
that
sort
of
idea,
when
expressed
in
terms
of
state
taxes,
would
lead
to
a
great
deal
of
confusion
and
unnecessary
burden
to
the
state
courts.
again,
that
is
a
reason
why
congress
did
not
intend
to
make
1983
mandatory.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
in
south
carolina
we
have
a
relatively
new
statute
called
the
administrative
procedures
act
statute.
and
after
having
an
administrative
hearing,
you
may
appeal
that
administrative
hearing
to
the
circuit
courts
of
our
state.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
the
provision
in
our
administrative
procedures
act
says
that
the
state
may
continue
to
do
whatever
it
is
it
was
going
to
do.
you
may
have
to
petition
to
the
circuit
court
to
prevent
them
from
doing
it.
what
would
happen
in
state
tax
areas
is
that
the
state
would
go
ahead
and
collect
its
money
because
of
the
very
vital
concern
the
state
has
for
having
its
revenue
during
the
time
that
litigation
is
going
on.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
do
not
wish
to
mislead
the
court.
there
is
another
remedy
called
a
claim
for
refund,
but
that
is
a
situation
where
the
state
already
has
the
money,
and
you
are
filing
a
claim
for
refund
asking
to
get
it
back.
and
when
that
is
denied,
then
you--
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
--it
has
much
of
the
characteristics
of
an
administrative
function,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
that's
correct.
but
in
both
instances
the
state
already
has
its
money.
one
of
the
additional
points
that
we
think
is
important
for
deciding:
did
congress
require
states
to
hear
1983
actions
is
that
of
there
being
the
requirement
of
a
clear
statement
when
congress
wishes
to
intrude
into
a
fundamental
state
area.
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
more
fundamental
area
than
the
ability
of
a
state
to
raise
its
own
taxes.
if
that
is
the
case,
then
where
is
the
clear
statement
in
1983
that
it
is
to
be
made
mandatory
upon
the
state?
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
clear
statement
to
that
effect
in
1983.
and
in
a
similar
vein,
when
congress
seeks
to
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
a
state,
it
also
must
do
so
by
clear
language.
well,
in
this
particular
instance,
this
court
in
quern
v.
jordan
has
found
that
1983
does
not
contain
a
clear
statement
necessary
to
waive
the
state
sovereign
immunity
in
a
federal
court.
that
decision,
of
course,
is
based
on
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
at
is
of
course
recognized
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
not
applicable
in
state
courts.
but
the
eleventh
amendment
does
contain
the
very
germ
of
truth
which
is
critical
to
this
case;
that
is,
that
states
retain
sovereign
immunity
when
it
is
going
to
be
sued
in
its
own
court.
the
state
ought
to
have
the
right
to
not
be
sued
in
its
own
court
unless
congress
has
clearly
said
you
may
be
sued
in
your
own
courts.
well,
the
effect
of
quern
v.
jordan
is
to
'say
there
is
not
a
clear
statement
in
1983
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
because
it
is
not
there.
we
think
the
same
rule
applies
in
the
state
court,
that
the
state
is
not
to
be
sued
unless
that
statement
is
in
the
legislation.
in
summary,
what
we
would
like
to
present
to
this
court
are
basically
two
things.
first
of
all,
in
order
for
1983
to
be
found
to
be
mandatory
upon
the
states,
there
has
to
be
either
a
constitutional
source
for
that
rule,
or
there
has
to
be
congressional
authority
for
that
rule.
the
constitution
does
not
provide
that
source,
because
that
source
has
been
presented
to
this
court
as
being
the
supremacy
clause.
the
supremacy
clause
itself
does
not
mandate
that
states
hear
1983.
all
that
it
requires
is
that
they
apply
federal
law
when
they
are
hearing
the
particular
claims
of
the
taxpayer.
and
south
carolina
has
done
that.
they
applied
the
federal
privileges
and
immunities
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution.
secondly,
in
order
for
1983
to
become
mandatory
in
the
state
tax
system,
there
has
to
be
congressional
direction
to
that
effect.
the
legislative
history,
the
literal
language
of
1983
does
not
support
such
a
contention.
it
is
our
view
that
1983
in
a
state
tax
matter
was
never
intended
by
congress,
and
in
fact,
there
are
adequate
remedies
in
the
state
which
provide
the
taxpayer
to
vindicate
any
and
all
constitutional
rights
that
he
may
have.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
yes,
sir.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
your
honor,
there
were
numerous
counts
in
the
complaint.
1983
was
identified
as
a
particular
count.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
yes.
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
yes,
sir.
that's--
mr.
ray
n.
stevens
--yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
thank
you.
