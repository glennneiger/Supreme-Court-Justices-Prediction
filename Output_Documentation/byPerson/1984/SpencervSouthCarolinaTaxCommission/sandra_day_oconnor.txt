mr.
parr,
are
there
any
circumstances
in
your
view
under
which
a
state
court
could
refuse
to
entertain
a
section
1983
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
failure
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
jurisdiction
that
does
require
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
exhaustion
could
be
a
matter
of
a
prerequisite
to
state
court
jurisdiction,
depending
on
how
it's
set
up
in
the
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
rely
on
specifically
for
the
determination
that
congress
wanted
to
require
states
to
entertain
1983
actions
instead
of
just
allowing
them
to?
