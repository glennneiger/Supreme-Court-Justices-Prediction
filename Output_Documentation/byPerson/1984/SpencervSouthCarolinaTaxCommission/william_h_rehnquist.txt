justice
rehnquist
mr.
parr,
certainly
there
are
some
limits
to
the
broad
proposition
i
understand...
for
instance,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
although
passed
by
congress,
are
not
the
law
in
south
carolina
courts,
are
they?
justice
rehnquist
so
the
question
is
whether
congress
intended
section
1983
to
be
mandatory
on
the
state
courts.
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
existence
of
jurisdiction
creates
an
obligation
to
exercise
it.
that
may
seem
collusive
to
you.
it
doesn't
to
me.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
that
regardless
of
what
congress
intended,
that
rule
applied?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
what
if
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
say
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
of
1983
controversies;
state
courts
may
take
jurisdiction
of
them
if
they
want,
but
they
don't
have
to?
now,
it's
conceivable
a
congress
could
have
had
that
intent,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
if
congress
did
have
that
particular
intent
in
mind,
it
would
prevail
over
the
kind
of
assertion
that
the
existence
of
jurisdiction
obligates
one
to
exercise
or
whatever
it
was
you
said,
wouldn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
what
if
we
went
back,
even
though
congress
hadn't
expressly
said
it,
and
came
to
the
conclusion
from
reading
the
legislative
debates
that
that
was
exactly
what
congress
intended;
wouldn't
the
same
conclusion
be
required?
justice
rehnquist
could
a
state
court
pass
an
anti-injunction
act
as
a
counterpart
of
the
federal
anti-injunction
act
to
preclude
injunctive
relief
when
you're
seeking
a
tax...
when
you're
making
a
constitutional
tax
claim
in
a
state
court?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
would
you
know
whether
it
frustrated
the
intent
of
congress?
justice
rehnquist
well,
suppose
that
in
your
case
you
had
sought
injunctive
relief
from
this
kind
of
tax
levy,
and
south
carolina
had
a
statute
saying
that
the
courts
do
not
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
tax
act.
you
have
to
have
some
other
remedy.
you
can't
have
an
injunction.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
was
suing
for
a
refund
as
an
adequate
remedy;
you
nonetheless
sought
an
injunction.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
says
well,
the
anti-injunction
act
prevails.
do
you
think
1983
would
prevent
south
carolina
from
enforcing
its
anti-injunction
act
in
those
circumstances?
justice
rehnquist
the
result
suggested
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
would
make
your
victory
even
more
tasteless,
i
suppose.
[laughter]
justice
rehnquist
but
here
there
was
a
statement
under
protest
and
an
action
to
recover,
wasn't
there?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
is
it
a
sufficient
answer,
as
you
suggest,
this
neutral
principles
point
that
you're...
if
congress
had
said
in
so
many
words
the
state
courts
of
south
carolina
must
entertain
1983
actions?
