justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
please?
i
don't
quite
understand
with
reference
to
your
argument
why
you
rely
on
that
point.
supposing
they
were
just
enforcing
the
liquor
laws,
would
you
say
then
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
applicable?
justice
stevens
but
i
am
still
not
quite
clear.
supposing
it
had
been
the
other
purpose,
just
to
enforce
the
liquor
laws?
then
what
is
your
view
on
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
would
apply?
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
a
simple
question,
if
i
can.
is
it
your
position
that
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
apply
to
this
kind
of
proceeding
provided
that
the
officer
had
a
criminal
objective?
justice
stevens
and
that
is...
but
is
that...
assume
he
didn't,
would
you
make
a
different...
would
you
concede
it
would
apply,
or
you
would
just
say
that
is
just
a
different
case?
justice
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
your
last
argument
for
just
a
second?
justice
stevens
i
was
trying
to
think
it
through.
i
understand
you
want
to
win
this
case,
of
course,
but
apart
from
this
case,
it
really
doesn't
make
much
difference
to
you,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
because
you
can
always
get
the
information
by
following
the
other,
the
nonwarrant
procedure.
justice
stevens
so
this
is
really
kind
of
a
one
shot
situation.
justice
stevens
ms.
managhan,
may
i
ask
one
factual
question?
i
think
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
that
the
attic
lounge,
inc.
is
a
named
respondent,
it
has
not
filed
any
papers
in
the
case.
justice
stevens
is
it
still
in
business?
is
the
lounge
still
in--
justice
stevens
--oh,
it
is
out
of
business?
justice
stevens
do
we
have
a
live
case
in
front
of
us
then?
justice
stevens
who
is
interested
in
winning
or
losing
then?
justice
stevens
they
would
like
to
know
what
the
law
is.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
will
the
outcome
of
the
case
actually
decide
whether
anybody
sells
any
liquor
or
not?
justice
stevens
in
just
knowing
what
the
law
is.
justice
stevens
so
really
even
theoretically
there
is
not
a
great
deal
at
stake.
justice
stevens
because
we
are
really
asked
to
decide
this
case
only,
and
this
case
itself
is
moot.
justice
stevens
desk
drawers.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
if
your
state
supreme
court
has
authority
to
render
advisory
opinions?
in
some
states
they
do.
justice
stevens
and
so
perhaps
they
were
well
aware
of
this
whole
situation
and
just
rendered
an
advisory
opinion.
justice
stevens
oh,
they
were
at
that,
then.
justice
stevens
of
course,
you
take
the
position
that
they
were
right
in
their
view
on
the
law.
justice
stevens
but
so
that
if
we
sent
it
back,
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
would
have
the
power
to
say,
well,
that
is
all
well
and
good,
but
our
advisory
opinion
is
the
following
anyway.
they
could
still
just
give
this
as
an
advisory
opinion,
even
if
there
is
no
more
life
at
this
point.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
procedure
in
the
case
that
kind
of
puzzles
me?
justice
stevens
apart
from
this
one
case...
and
i
understand
that
your
client
sustained
or
revoked
the...
or
reinstated
the
license,
in
effect,
here--
justice
stevens
--that
apart
from
this
case,
that
your
client's
general
duties
are
supervising
the
administration
of
liquor
laws
in
a
certain
capacity.
why
wouldn't
it
be
in
your
client's
best
interest
not
to
have
the
exclusionary
rule
apply?
wouldn't
your
client
generally
be
able
to
perform
his
function
better
if
he
had
more
evidence
available
to
him?
justice
stevens
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
actual,
his
interest
in
performing
his
job
would
be
better
served
if
you
lost
the
lawsuit.
