justice
rehnquist
your
liquor
control
administrator,
i
take
it,
thought
otherwise
until
the
superior
court
straightened
him
out.
justice
rehnquist
so
it
would
be
up
to
the
town
of
tiverton--
justice
rehnquist
but
let's
suppose
that
this
court
did
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island.
our
mandate
would
then
go
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island,
which
was
considering
in
this
case
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
superior
court.
now,
wouldn't
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
send
that
case
back
to
the
superior
court,
and
the
superior
court
send
it
back
to
you?
justice
rehnquist
so
that
it
isn't
up
to
someone
else
to
start
a
new
proceeding.
this
proceeding
would
go
back
to
you.
justice
rehnquist
and
so
it
depends
on
what
tiverton
wanted
to
do--
justice
rehnquist
--what
would
happen?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
tiverton
says
we
already
revoked,
and
your
decision
setting
aside
our
revocation
has
now
been
overturned
by
the
higher
courts?
justice
rehnquist
well,
since
we
are
on
the
subject,
why
on
earth
are
you
trying
to
sustain
this
decision?
i
would
think
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
liquor
administrator,
he
would
want
his
powers
to
be
as
unfettered
as
possible.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
since
you
are
not
a
court
but
really
advising
the
liquor
administrator,
why
don't
you
try
to
get
the
best
ruling
you
can
from
the
highest
court
in
the
land?
justice
rehnquist
and
what
would
that
consist
of?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i'd
always
thought,
having
spent
three
years
in
the
justice
department,
that
the
job
of
any
government
lawyer
was
to
see
that
there
were
the
fewest
conceivable
restraints
on
government
conduct,
that
if
there
were
restraints
on
government
conduct,
it
should
come
from
governmental
decision,
not
judicial
decision.
justice
rehnquist
i
guess
i
would
have
made
a
poor
rhode
island
liquor
control
administrator.
