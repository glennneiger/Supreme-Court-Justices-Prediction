justice
o'connor
ms.
managhan,
under
new
jersey
law,
could
the
officers
have
entered
the
bar
without
a
warrant
and
made
a
search
under
the
authority
of
the
liquor
control
laws
regardless
of
any--
justice
o'connor
--was
one
part
owner
of
the
attic
lounge
also
a
member
of
the
town
council?
what
was
the
link?
justice
o'connor
ms.
managhan,
also
of
course
we
have
here
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
by
a
magistrate,
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
and
is
the
magistrate
an
official
of
the
town,
or
is
that...
was
that
officer
someone
who
was
a
state
officer
appointed
by
the
state?
justice
o'connor
not
selected
by
the
town,
but--
justice
o'connor
--selected
by
the
state,
a
different--
justice
o'connor
--is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
we
would
know
whether
the
officers
were
interested
in
securing
evidence
of
a
criminal
offense
as
opposed
to
evidence
for
suspension
or
revocation
of
the
license?
justice
o'connor
but
then
it
has
to
go
to
the
state
liquor
control
administrator
for
review.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
it
is
the
state
liquor
control
administrator
who
is
your
opponent
in
these
proceedings.
justice
o'connor
no
brief
being
filed
by
owners
of
the
attic
lounge.
justice
o'connor
the
board,
the
town
commission
minutes
in
the
appendix
do
reflect
that
a
one-third
owner
of
shares
in
the
attic
lounge
was
apparently
one
of
the
town
commissioners
voting
on
the
matter.
justice
o'connor
i
don't
know
that
it
is
any...
has
any
great
relevance,
but
i
thought
it
was
curious.
justice
o'connor
but
this
wasn't
point
out
in
your
brief
anywhere,
and
we
have
no
brief
from
the
attic
lounge.
so
these
facts
that
we
are
discussing
are
simply
not
apparent
from
the
record.
justice
o'connor
well,
if
it
is
moot,
we
simply
wouldn't
decide
it
at
all,
would
we?
justice
o'connor
that's
why
it
becomes
important
to
us
to
know.
except
also
isn't
it
true
your
opponent
said
that
the
precedent
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
except
in
this
case
because
they
can
always
get
the
information
without
using
a
warrant
by
following
the
statutory
procedure.
justice
o'connor
would
it
have
an
effect
in
the
future
on
the
ability
of
the
owners
of
the
attic
lounge
to
get...
to
hold
a
liquor
license
in
the
future?
justice
o'connor
so
it
would
have
that
effect.
justice
o'connor
and
why
wouldn't
the
liquor
control
administrator
of
the
state
be
interested
then
in
going
back
and
taking
action
so
that
he
would
know
the
status
of
these
people
in
the
future
if
they
were
to
come
back
into
business.
justice
o'connor
--well,
the
town
has
already
acted.
it
was
the
officer
whom
you
are
representing
who
disagreed
with
the
town.
justice
o'connor
the
town
has
already
acted.
justice
o'connor
so
your
administrator
would
not
consider
changing
his
aim
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
on
the
appeal?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
town
did
take
it
and
that
your
administrator
heard
it
on
appeal.
justice
o'connor
yes.
well,
why
wouldn't
it
go
back
to
your
administrator?
i
don't
understand,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
town
acted.
because
the
license
has
been
transferred?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
hines,
do
you
suppose
that
one
plymouth
sedan
quasi-criminal
analysis
survives
the
balancing
test
now
employed
by
the
court
not
only
in
janis,
but
in
cases
like
leon
and
shephard,
which
themselves
were
actually
criminal
cases.
do
you
think
that
this
court
is
now
content
to
just
say,
well,
it's
quasi-criminal,
so
we
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
automatically
without
considering
any
of
the
factors
that
would
justify
the
application
of
such
a
rule.
justice
o'connor
but
that
might
put
the
cart
before
the
horse,
mightn't
it?
don't
you
balance
to
see
if
it
applies?
