ms.
kathleen
managhan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
the
issue
before
you
today
is
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied
to
exclude
the
admission
of
evidence
at
an
administrative
hearing,
in
this
case
a
liquor
license
revocation
hearing,
which
evidence
has
already
been
excluded
from
use
at
criminal
trial.
the
lower
court,
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
answered
this
question
affirmatively.
the
evidence
excluded
in
this
case,
stolen
property,
clothing,
was
found
on
the
premises
of
the
attic
lounge,
a
licensed
tiverton,
rhode
island
liquor-serving
establishment.
on
march
11,
1977,
the
tiverton
police
entered
the
attic
lounge
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
which
had
been
obtained
by
them
after
receiving
a
tip
from
a
neighboring
police
department
that
they
would
find
stolen
property
on
the
property
of
the
attic
lounge.
they
entered
the
lounge,
they
found
the
stolen
property.
however,
later
that
warrant
was
held
defective
by
a
rhode
island
superior
court
judge,
and
therefore
the
search
warrant
was
quashed.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
it
is
my
understanding
the
grounds
for
the
quashing
of
the
warrant
were
that
the
police
did
not
knock
prior
to
entering
the
premises
of
the
attic
lounge,
and
also
apparently
the
trial
court
judge
believed
that
the
affidavit
which
accompanied
and
caused
the
warrant
to
issue
did
not
show
probable,
sufficient
probable
cause.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
we
do
not
have
a
record
of
the
actual
criminal
proceedings,
but
they
are
referred
to.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
it
is,
however,
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
because
of
the
quashing
of
the
warrant,
criminal
charges--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--yes,
mrs.
justice
o'connor.
under
rhode
island
law,
because
this
was
a
licensed
liquor-serving
establishment,
there
is
a
particular
rhode
island
statute...
i
believe
it
is
cited
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief...
which
allows
police
officers
and
other
municipal
officials
at
any
time
to
enter
the
premises
of
a
licensed
liquor-serving
establishment
in
order
to
see
whether
they
are
carrying
out
their
operations
within
the
parameters
of
the
law,
and
for
other
reasons.
this
was
in
fact
acknowledged
by
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
in
its
decision.
in
this
case,
however,
in
this
case
the
tiverton
police
did
in
fact
seek
a
warrant.
obviously
their
chief
thought
was
in
order
to
obtain
stolen
property,
they
did
go
into
the
premises
of
the
bar,
found
the
stolen
property,
but
the
warrant
was
quashed.
this,
of
course,
meant
that
the
criminal
charges
which
the
state
of
rhode
island
had
initially
brought
against
the
manager
of
the
bar
and
against
the
bartender,
had
to
be
dropped.
however,
the
tiverton
town
council,
which
functions
as
a
local
licensing
authority
for
bars
within
its
jurisdiction,
had
also
started
procedures,
liquor
license
revocation
procedures,
against
the
owner
of
the
attic
lounge.
they
had
begun
these
procedures
pursuant
to
a
rhode
island
statute,
another
rhode
island
statute
which
i
believe
appears
in
the
appendix
to
my
petition,
which
allows
a
municipality
to
revoke
a
liquor
license
where
it
can
be
shown
that
any
state
law
was
violated
on
the
premises
of
that
licensed
establishment.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
no,
no,
that
is
not
my
understanding.
there
was
no
identity
between
the
council
members
and
the
bar
principals.
march
28,
1977,
the
town
council
sitting
as
license
commissioners
held
a
hearing,
heard
testimony
from
the
local
police
about
their
obtaining
of
the
warrant,
their
searching
the
premises
of
the
bar,
finding
the
stolen
clothing,
on
the
basis
of
that
presentation,
revoked
the
license
of
the
bar.
the
bar
owners
appealed.
initially
they
appealed,
as
it
provided
by
rhode
island
statutory
law,
to
the
liquor
license
administrator,
mr.
pastore,
who
reversed
the
town
council
on
other
grounds,
not
exclusionary
rule
grounds.
the
town
then
appealed
that
decision
to
the
rhode
island
superior
court
which,
for
the
first
time,
raised
the
issue
of
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
should
have
been
applied
to
an
administrative
hearing,
and
held
that
in
fact
the
liquor
license
administrator,
for
the
wrong
reasons,
but
nevertheless,
was
correct
in
vacating
the
revoking
of
the
license.
the
town
therefore
appealed
that
decision
to
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
affirmed
the
lower
court's
holding
that
evidence
of
stolen
property
obtained
pursuant
to
an
invalid
warrant
and
suppressed
already
for
criminal
purposes,
should
not
have
been
admissible
at
a
liquor
license
hearing.
this
did
this
i
believe
on
three
bases.
they
indicated
very
clearly
in
their
decision
an
unwillingness
to
dilute
the
deterrent
effects
of
the
exclusionary
rule
on
police
misconduct
by
allowing
illegally
obtained
evidence
to
be
admitted
at
such
an
administrative
hearing.
they
also
did
it
by
analogizing
this
administrative
hearing,
liquor
license
revocation
hearing,
to
a
so-called
quasi-criminal
hearing.
they
called
it
quasi-criminal
in
character
and
therefore
said
that
just
as
the
exclusionary
rule
is
applied
to
criminal
hearings,
so
should
it
be
applied
to
quasi-criminal
hearings
such
as
this.
and
they
finally
found
an
insufficient
societal
interest
in
the
control
of
liquor-serving
establishments
to
justify
a
different
finding
from
the
one
that
they
had
made.
we
believe
that
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
should
be
reversed
on
each
of
these
grounds:
first,
on
the
ground
of
deterrence.
i
believe
that
this
court
in
janis
has
commented
on
the
uncertainty
as
to
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
in
fact
deters
police
from
improper
searches
and
seizures.
it
was
suggested
i
believe
in
that
decision
that
where
there
has
already
been
criminal
exclusion
of
suppressed
evidence,
that
that
is
enough,
that
that
is
a
sufficient
sharp
medicine,
if
you
will,
strong
medicine,
enacted
against
a
local
police,
that
that
is
enough
to
just...
enough
exclusion
in
that
case.
i
would
argue
that
exclusion
has
already
occurred
here.
the
evidence
that
was
obtained
by
the
tiverton
police
has
already
been
excluded
from
a
criminal
proceeding.
therefore,
there
has
been
a
sufficient
penalty
enforced
against
the
tiverton
police
to
justify
the
deterrent
purposes
of
that
rule.
moreover,
this
exclusion
occurred
at
a
criminal
hearing
which
i
would
argue
that
criminal
hearing,
that
criminal
charge
was
the
tiverton
police's
zone
of
primary
interest.
i
would
admit
that
under
the
standards
that
were
brought
forth
by
this
court
in
janis,
that
this
probably
qualifies
as
an
intrasovereign
situation
on
its
bare
facts.
i
would,
however,
argue
that
despite
this
being
an
intrasovereign
situation,
so
to
speak,
that
despite
their
probable
employment
status,
the
chief
zone
of
primary
interest
for
these
tiverton
police
officers
entering
the
bar
on
that
march
evening
was
a
criminal
offense
and
not
a
licensing
offense.
and
i
believe
this
is--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
in
the
case
of
rhode
island,
it
would
have
had
to
have
been
a
judge.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
no,
oh,
no.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
no,
it
would
have
been
a
judge
who
would
have
issued
that
warrant.
i
would
argue
that
this,
that
this
particular
criminal
hearing
and
not
the
licensing
hearing
was
the
zone
of
primary
interest
for
the
police
officers
involved
for
various
reasons.
they
acted
on
a
tip.
they
acted
on
a
tip
that
there
was
stolen
property
at
the
lounge.
based
on
that
tip
they
obtained
a
warrant.
they
obtained
a
warrant
that
specifically
indicated
that
they
were
searching
for
stolen
property.
they
also,
in
effect,
under
rhode
island
law,
and
under
rhode
island
criminal
procedures,
were
basically
acting
as
agents
of
the
state,
not
the
city
which
employed
them,
in
investigating
the
possible
commission
of
a
felony.
in
rhode
island,
it
is
the
state
attorney
general's
office
and
not
the
municipalities
that
actually
prosecute
felony
offenses.
therefore,
i
would
argue
that
the
tiverton
police
entering
the
lounge
that
evening
were
basically
acting
as
state
agents,
not
as
agents
of
the
town
which
employed
them.
they
were
interested
in
the
possible
commission
of
a
felony,
not
in
the
possible
commission
of
a
licensing
offense.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
no,
there
is
not
specific
evidence
where
an
officer
was
actually
asked
what
was
your
purpose
in
going
to
the
lounge.
i
would
say
you
would
have
to
make
that
determination,
your
honor,
from
an
empirical
examination
of
how
the
entrance
to
the
lounge
occurred.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
the
warrant
affidavit,
which
i
have
to
admit,
your
honor,
i
have
not
seen,
but
basically
consisted--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--that's
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
yes.
the
warrant
affidavit--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--the
warrant
affidavit,
as
i
understand
it,
reflected
the
knowledge
of
a
fall
river
police
officer
who
had
obtained
from
an
informer
the
information
that
there
was
stolen
property
to
be
found
on
the
lounge
premises.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct,
and
that's
the
argument
i
am
making,
that
they
received
information
that
was
directly
oriented
towards
the
violation
of
a
criminal
offense,
to
wit,
the
harboring
of
stolen
property
on
the
lounge
premises.
now,
the
fact
that
they
obtained
a
warrant--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--i
am
relying
on
the...
i
am
arguing
that
point
because
i
believe
that
this
court
has
indicated
some
concern
in
the
janis
case
particularly
about
what
was
the
real
purpose
pursuant
to
which
the
officers
actually
obtained
evidence
which
was
later
held
unlawfully
seized.
in
other
words,
did
they
have
in
mind...
what
was
their
chief
purpose?
did
they
have
in
mind--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--then
i
think
you
probably
have
a
situation
very
similar
to
what
this
court
faced
in
lopez-medndoza
where
it
was
basically
admitted
that
officials,
officers,
immigration
officers,
actually
acted
with
a
specific
civil
proceeding
in
mind,
and
in
that
case,
which
i
don't
believe
is
this
case,
you
might
very
well
have
to
argue
that
the
exclusionary
rule
would
have
to
be
applied
to
that
civil
proceeding
unless
you
had
circumstances
such
as
this
court
found
in
lopez-mendoza
that
for
other
reasons
distinguished
the
proceeding--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
i
would
say
that
is
a
different
case.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
they
found...
i
am
not
sure
of
that,
your
honor.
i
am
sure
they
probably
didn't
find
it
right
in
the
center
of
the
bar.
probably
they
found
those
stolen
goods
in
a
closet
back
in
the
storage
area.
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
that
they
were
probably
out
of
sight--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--of
bar
patrons
of
the
attic
lounge.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that's
right,
that's
right.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
rhode
island?
ms.
kathleen
managhan
perhaps
we
don't
have
one
such
as
is
found
in
other
states.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
responsibility
is
primarily
borne
in
rhode
island
by
local
police
officials.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
they
function
primarily
on
an
administrative
basis,
your
honor,
to
hear
appeals
such
as
was
taken
from
the
town
of
tiverton.
most--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--that
could
certainly
be
one
reason,
yes,
or
unstamped
liquor,
or--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--right.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
it
can
be.
yes,
it
can
be,
or
by
municipal
officials
that
are
specifically
designated
to
have
that
responsibility.
in
rhode
island
these
kinds
of
liquor
license
offenses
are
handled
initially
on
the
municipal
level,
and
if
you
will
read
the
statutory
authority
that
i
have
cited
in
my
appendix
to
my
petition
and
also
my
appendix
to
my
brief,
it
becomes
very
clear.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
no,
it
is
the
local
town
council.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
yes.
the
local
town
council
awards
the
licenses--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--and
suspends
them,
and
revokes
them,
yes.
they
basically
put
on
another,
another
hat,
if
you
will,
and
sit
as
a
local
liquor
licensing
or
revoking
authority,
and
they
do
have
as--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
well,
if
it
is
appealed.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
if
it
is
appealed.
there
is
no
automatic
transfer.
it
is
not
automatically
reviewed.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
i
stand
corrected.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
i
stand
corrected,
your
honor.
it
was
not
a
point
that
was
ever
dwelled
upon
by
the
lower
court.
that
is
entirely
possible.
tiverton
is
a
small
town.
you
have...
several
of
you
have
brought
up
the
existence
of
this
particular
rhode
island
statute
which
enables
local
police
officers,
where
they
are
interested
in
learning
of
licensing
offenses,
to
actually
enter
the
premises
of
a
bar
in
order
to
determine
whether
those
licensing
offenses
have
in
fact
occurred.
i
bring
that
to
your
attention
to
indicate
what
to
me
seems
to
be
a
very
clear
indication
that
for
the
tiverton
police
officers
entering
the
attic
lounge,
license...
licensing
offenses
were
not
what
were
on
their
mind.
if
they
were
interested
in
determining
licensing
offenses,
or
if
that
was
further
down
the
line
for
them,
they
would
in
fact
have
not
even
bothered
to
have
obtained
a
warrant.
they
would
have
simply
entered
the
bar,
and
they
could
have
checked
around
to
see
if
there
were
any
licensing
offenses,
and
the
statute
does
not
provide
any
limitation
to
where
they
may
look,
so
presumably
they
could
have
looked
over
the
entire
premises,
and
as
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
itself
admits,
if
in
fact
being
on
the
premises
pursuant
to
that
statute
they
had
seen
property
which
they
knew
from
other
information
to
have
been
stolen,
they
could
have
acted
appropriately.
they
didn't
do
this.
they
got
a
warrant.
and
i
think
what
this
indicates,
it
indicates
two
things.
it
first
of
all
supports
my
argument
which
i
am
once
again
basing
upon
this
court's
concern
in
janis,
with
primary
zone
of
interest,
that
this...
these
police
officers'
primary
zone
of
interest
was
felony
investigation
and
not
license
investigation.
if
it
had
been
license
investigation,
why
would
they
have
bothered
to
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
getting
the
warrant?
in
fact,
they
did.
i
think
this
very
clearly
indicates
that
it
was
the
felony
investigation
that
was
chiefly
on
their
minds.
it
brings
up
another
issue,
however,
the
existence
of
this
statute,
as
to
what
deterrent
effect
there
would
be
if
in
this
case
the
evidence
that
was
obtained
by
the
unlawful
warrant
was
in
fact
excluded.
where
you
have
a
statute
such
as
this,
there
really
is
very
little
deterrence
effect
at
all.
all
it
will
really
do
is
discourage
rhode
island
police
officers
henceforth
from
ever
obtaining
a
warrant
where
there
is
any
other
basis
pursuant
to
which
they
can
go
on
licensed
premises
in
order
to
take
a
look
around.
in
this
case
it
certainly
is
not
going
to
encourage
police
officers
to
obtain
a
warrant.
it
will
have
exactly
the
opposite
effect.
they
will
not
want
to
take
a
chance
that
the
warrant
will
be
quashed,
that
the
evidence
will
be
considered
excluded
for
any
purposes,
and
they
will
therefore
simply
enter
the
bar
under
the
statutory
basis
and
will...
and
see
what
they
can
see.
and
presumably,
if
they
see
something
that
indicates
a
felony
violation,
they
could
present
it
to
the
attorney
general's
office
for
prosecution
of
that
felony
violation,
and
there
would
be
no
constitutional
issue
because
they
were
appropriately
on
the
premises
pursuant
to
the
statute.
so
i
think
if
in
fact
this
court
were
to
determine
that
the
excluded
evidence
could
not
be
used
at
the
liquor
license
revocation
hearing
because
of
the
quashed
warrant,
this
would
have,
if
anything,
the
opposite
of
a
deterrent
effect
on
police
officers
because
it
would
discourage
them
from
using
the
more
protective
constitutional
means
of
obtaining
a
warrant.
instead
they
would
always
proceed
under
the
statute.
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
also
indicated
its
belief
that
this
liquor
license
revocation
hearing
was
in
fact
a
quasi
criminal
hearing,
although
we
attempted
to--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--yes.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
called
this
particular
procedure
a
quasi-criminal
proceeding
because
the
object
of
the
proceeding,
the
liquor
license
revocation
proceeding,
was
to
penalize
for
a
legal
offense.
this
court
i
believe
in
lopez-mendoza
designated
a
very
similar,
similar
proceeding
as
a
civil
proceeding,
and
i
believe
there
are
great
analogies
between
the
deportation
hearings
and
the
liquor
license
revocation
hearing
that
is
before
you.
for
instance,
in
this
case,
the
tiverton
town
council
was
reviewing
admittedly
bad
past
behavior
of
the
bar
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
should
continue
to
be
entitled
to
hold
a
liquor
license
issued
by
the
town.
similarly,
in
lopez-mendoza,
this
court
was
faced
with
the
factual
circumstances
of
whether
an
alien
should
be
allowed
to
continue
to
remain
in
this
country
because
of
how
he
had
happened
to
enter
this
country,
whether
he
had
come
in
properly
or
not.
in
both
of
these
cases
an
administrative
tribunal
was
reviewing
behavior
which
could
be
the
subject
of
separate
criminal
action,
but
the
review
was
not
in
fact
criminal
in
type.
also,
another
similarity
between
what
is
before
you
and
lopez-mendoza,
it
was
the
informality
of
the
proceeding.
the
tiverton
town
council
was
the
tribunal
which
was
hearing
evidence,
excluded
evidence,
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
should
be
a
license
revocation.
certainly
some
rules
of
evidence
probably
pertain,
but
you
are
basically
dealing
with
a
lay,
a
lay
board
making
a
determination
as
to
revocation
or
nonrevocation.
another
point
which
should
be
mentioned
is
that
tribunals
such
as
tiverton
in
rhode
island
do
not
need
to
be
shown
that
a
conviction
was
obtained
for
this
offense
against
rhode
island
laws
in
order
for
them
to
revoke
a
license.
in
other
words,
they
can
be
presented
with
evidence
that
in
fact
rhode
island
laws
were
violated
on
the
premises
of
a
bar.
but
they
don't
actually
have
to
be
shown
evidence
that
a
conviction
was
obtained.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct,
and
he
was
told
that
that
in
fact
was
not
the
case,
that
a
conviction
is
not
necessary.
to
me
this
indicates
an
indication
that
there
is
a
lesser
standard
of
evidentiary
concern
in
order
to
determine
whether
a
licensed
liquor
establishment
ought
to
have
their
license
revoked.
it
is
true
that
a
board
such
as
the
town
of
tiverton,
in
making
this
kind
of
determination,
may
in
fact
penalize.
however,
i
would
argue
that
an
immigration
court
also
penalizes
in
the
deportation
hearing
if
they
in
fact
decide
that
an
alien's
behavior
justifies
their
being
deported.
i
do
not
think
that
this
penal,
possible
penal
aspect
of
a
civil
hearing
such
as
before
you
is
something
that
should
be,
as
it
was
with
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
a
center
for
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied
to
such
a
tribunal.
in
fact,
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
admits
excluded
evidence
in
certain
kinds
of
criminal
hearings,
as
do
a
number
of
courts.
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
in
its
decision
referred
to
probation
revocation
hearings
and
bail
revocation
hearings
as
criminal
proceedings
where,
although
a
penalty
might
be
the
ultimate
result,
that
in
fact
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
apply
to
these
subsequent
but
nevertheless
criminal
proceedings.
many
civil
administrative
hearings
have
penal
elements.
this
type
of
hearing
may
in
fact
be
held
to
have
some
kind
of
penal
element
to
it.
however,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
made
very
clear
in
janis
and
in
lopez-mendoza
that
the
label
on
a
hearing
is
not
nearly
as
important
as
the
effect
of
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
to
that
hearing
will
have
on
law
enforcement
practices
in
the
area
and
on
the...
and
what
the
social
impact
will
be
of
such
an
application.
i
would
pass
to
what
that
social
impact
would
be.
i
believe
you
have
before
you
in
the
regulation
of
the
sale
of
liquor
an
excellent
example
of
a
traditional
and
appropriate
area
of
great
governmental
concern.
and
i
think
that
the
statutes
that
we
have
discussed
in
rhode
island
show
that
there
is
a
clearly
public
policy
for
close
control
of
licensed
liquor-serving
establishments.
in
fact,
a
license
to
serve
liquor
is
a
privilege
which
is
granted
by
a
governmental
authority
in
rhode
island,
by
a
municipal
authority,
contingent,
and
is
held
contingent
upon
the
proper
operation
of
those
premises.
the
public
need
for
that
control
is
clearly
shown
by
the
statutes
that
we
have
discussed,
for
instance,
the
ability
to
enter
upon
the
premises
at
any
time
without
a
warrant
simply
to
determine
appropriate
operation,
upon
the
fact
that
a
license
may
be
revoked
for
any
proof
of
the
fact
that
a
state
law
or
other
municipal
law
has
been
broken
on
those
premises,
even
if
there
has
been
no
conviction
for
the
same.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
i
would
disagree.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
i
did
discuss
two
cases,
one
from
illinois
and
one
from
ohio,
both
of
which
basically
indicated
that
where
liquor
license
revocation
was
the
concern,
that
in
fact
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
apply.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
there
are
other
cases
to
the
contrary.
there
are
the
cases
that
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
relied
on
in
its
decision.
the
finn's
case
is
probably
the
most
well
known
example
in
new
york,
and
i
believe
there
are
other
decisions
in
pennsylvania.
those
cases
particularly
deal
with
the
issue
of
liquor
license
revocation.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
larger
issue
of
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
ought
to
be
applied
to
civil
hearings
in
general,
you
will
find
a
very
mixed
treatment
of
this
particular
issue,
and
i
believe
i
gave
as
an
example
the
treatment
that
the
state
of
california
has
given
to
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
civil
hearings.
one
of
their
best
cases
was...
best
known
cases
was
the
emslie
case
in
which
they
basically
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
discussed
what
for
them
is
a
very
tight
adherence
to
the
exclusionary
rule
even
in
some
other
so-called
civil
proceedings,
and
then
proceed
to
not
apply
it
in
a
proceeding
which
dealt
with
disbarment
of
an
attorney.
so
while
i
would
admit
that
there
are
in
fact
some
very
strong
cases
against
me
on
the
limited
issue
of
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
liquor
license
revocation
proceedings,
i
think
if
you
take
the
larger
look
at
civil
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
a
variety
of
such
hearings,
you
will
find
that
in
fact
it
seems
as
though
the
jurisdictions
and
also
the
federal
courts
are
pretty
evenly
split.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
it
is
not
still
in
business.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
yes,
i
think
you
do.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
well,
i
think
that
the
town
is
interested,
and
also
the
liquor
license...
the
liquor
license
administrator
is
also
interested.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is...
it
will
not
because
the
attic
lounge
has
in
fact
gone
out
of
business.
so
i
think
the
interests
that
you
have
before
you
are
there
interests
of
the
town
and
also
of
the
state
agency
in
determining
what
the
proper
law
should
be.
ms.
kathleen
managhan
that
is
correct.
if
i
could
simply
summarize,
i
believe
that
i
have
mentioned
some
societal
interests
in
close...
in
the
close
control
of
licensed
liquor
premises
which
are
very
much
part
of
this
case.
i
think
you
have
a
situation
here
where
improperly
obtained
evidence
has
already
been
excluded,
and
therefore
the
local
police
whose
behavior
is
of
central
concern
to
this
court,
have
already
been
penalized.
i
believe
i
have
attempted
to
argue
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
tiverton
police
were
employed
by
the
town,
that
it
was
their
chief
interest,
criminal
investigation--
ms.
kathleen
managhan
--thank
you.
