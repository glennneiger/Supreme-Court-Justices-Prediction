mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
amplifying
somewhat
the
nature
of
liquor
matters
in
the
state
of
rhode
island.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
it
is
not
moot,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
the
attic
lounge
did
go
out
of
business,
but
they
did
not
go
out
of
business
immediately,
and
at
the
time
that
this
was
in
the
works,
it
would
have
an
effect
on
them.
other
than
that--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--yes.
they
cannot
sell
it
per
se,
your
honor.
they
can
make
an
application,
they
can
make
an
arrangement
to
sell
it
subject
to
the
sale
being
approved
by
the
town.
the
town
has
the--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--no,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
they
could
not.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
of
that,
but
i
would
doubt
if
that
were
the
case,
your
honor,
if
someone
wanted
to
succeed
to
that
license.
what
happened,
if
it
were
revoked,
it
would
then--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--the
license
is
probably
still
in
existence,
but
not
with
the
former
owners
of
the
attic
lounge.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
the
license
does
not
attach
to
anyplace.
the
municipality
has
a
certain
number
of
licenses
for
their
community,
and--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--nothing
whatsoever.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
i
have
no...
i
have
no
doubt,
although
i
am
not
certain,
that
since
this
time
the
license
has
been
transferred
to
another
entity,
totally
separate
from
the
attic
lounge,
and
they
are
probably
functioning
under
it
right
now.
it
will
have
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
licensing.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
in
future
hearings?
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
it
would
take
no
action
whatsoever.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
if
anyone
were
to
take
action,
it
would
be
the
local
community.
in
the
first
instance,
they
have
the
original
jurisdiction.
the
only--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
and
we
were--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
from
a
scholarly
point
of
view,
perhaps,
but
from
a
practical
point
of
view,
your
questions
point
out
that
the
ultimate
effect
does
not
have
a
practical
result.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
no,
they
were
not
pointed
out.
no,
they
are
not
apparent,
and
also,
your
honor,
some
of
them
are
my
assumption.
i
am
not
familiar
with
what
is
occurring
in
tiverton.
i
am
with
regard
to
the
liquor
control
administrator
and
his
concern
on
how
this
will
go
in
the
future.
but
the
court
can
be
made
aware
that
if
this
does
become
moot,
that
the
rhode
island
case
will
stand
and
the
exclusionary
rule
will
be
applicable.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
no,
you
would
not.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that
is
correct
also,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
no.
the
statute
is
in
the
appendix,
and
it
is
very
broad,
your
honor,
and
it
permits
a
whole
host
of
people,
the
mayor,
the
council,
may
at
any
time
enter
upon
the
premises
of
a
licensed
premises
to
ascertain
the
manner
in
which
the
person
conducts
his
business
and
to
preserve
order.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
under,
if
they
went
in
under
the
statute--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--yes,
they
could.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
right,
but
under
this
statute,
it
is
very
broad.
it
says
they
shall
have
the
power
to
arrest
without
a
warrant
all
persons
found
inside
in
the
commission
of
any
offense
in
violation
of
the
provisions
of
this
title,
the
liquor
title.
it
is
very
broad,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
i
don't
believe
the
living
quarters
are
premises.
the
liquor...
it
would
be
the
four
corners
of
the
establishment
with
respect
to
serving
of
liquor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
they
can.
i
believe
i
am
saying
to
you
this
statute,
if
you
read
it
literally,
is
so
liberal
that
it
would
permit
that.
i
don't
agree
that
it
would
be
proper
or
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
your
honor,
there
is
some,
as
my
adversary
has
pointed
out,
there
is
some
diversion
in
the
lower
courts
as
to
whether
or
not
the
exclusionary
rule
does
apply
in
this
type
of
proceeding.
it
would
be
some
clarification.
my
own
personal
feeling,
i
wouldn't
have
a
problem
with
that.
i
believe
that
in
that
event,
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
case
would
stand,
and
the
plymouth
sedan
case
would
still
stand
and
be
law,
and
those
are
the
cases
basically
that
i
am
relying
upon
for
my
position.
so
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
that.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
no,
he--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--he
would
do
that,
but
he
would
be
faced
with
the
same
situation
you
are
faced
with.
at
that
point
it
is
a
moot
question
for
him.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
the
license--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--no,
not
under
the
rhode
island
law,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
it
is
a
clean,
clean
slate.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
it...
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
it
would.
they
cannot--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--i
haven't
made
myself
clear.
he
would
definitely
be
interested.
he
doesn't
have
the
jurisdictional
authority
in
the
sense
that
that
type
of
thing
would
again
have
to
go
originally
to
the
local
board
for
them
to
determine
that.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that
is
correct,
yes,
your
honor,
and
that...
it
is
because
of
the
jurisdictional
aspects.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
they
have.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
he
would
consider
it
if
it
was
properly
before
him,
but
it
wouldn't
come
before
him
until,
first
of
all,
the
town
would
have
to
take
the
initial
original
action.
that's
the
way
the
law
is
structured
in
rhode
island.
the
administrator,
then
he
is
met
as
an
appeal.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
we
did,
de
novo.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
and
then
we
would
send
it
back
to
tiverton,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
scheme
of,
statutory
scheme
of
liquor
control
is
to
let
the
original
jurisdiction
handle
things
in
the
first
instance
on
their
own.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
an
interested
party
who
might
be
affected
by
that,
and
i
don't
think
one
exists
because
they
are
not
holding
the
license,
could
then
appeal
to
the
liquor
control
administrator.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
no,
can
i
say
that
at
the
level
of
the
supreme
court,
the
attic
lounge
people
were
represented
by
their
own
counsel.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
the...
i
was
not
involved
in
that.
it
was
the
town
of
tiverton
and
the
counsel
for
the
licensees
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
they
could.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
i
would
not
be
displeased
with
that
disposition
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
is
a
different
problem.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
basically
the
position
that
i
have
taken
is
twofold,
your
honors.
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
exclusionary
rule
applies.
and
i
have
taken
the
position
that
it
does,
and
i
am
in
agreement
with
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
based
upon
the
plymouth
sedan
case,
that
the
nature
of
a
license
revocation
is
quasi-criminal
in
nature
in
that
it
is
intended
to
penalize
the
licensee
for
a
past
transgression
or
commission
of
unlawful
conduct.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
it
would,
your
honor,
and
it
would
i
think
for
this
reason.
things
in
the
law
for
the
most
part
remain
static,
but
they
do
change,
and
one
of
the
things
that
has
changed
with
a
license,
an
alcoholic
beverage
license,
at
one
time
it
was
a
naked
privilege.
rhode
island
supreme
court
has
now
recognized
that
it
has
the
nature
of
a
property
right,
and
it
really
have
value
in
the
sense
that
without
it
someone
in
that
business
of
a
restaurant
or
lounge
is
not
going
to
make
any
money,
so
that
it
is
seriously
a
penalty
for
someone
to
have
a
lounge
business
or
restaurant
business
and
not
to
have
accompanying
it
an
alcoholic
beverage
license
in
today's
world.
as
a
result,
to
lose
it,
to
have
it
revoked
is
indeed
a
penalty,
and
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
the
rhode
island
statutes
provide
that
if
a
revocation
occurs
under
the
statute
which
tiverton
acted
under,
the
licensee
is
prohibited
also
from
having
an
alcoholic
beverage
license
in
that
state
for
a
period
of
five
years
time.
i
believe
that
that
is
penal
in
nature,
taking
into
account
the
loss
of
a
valuable
item
of
property
and
the
fact
that
for
five
years
you
are
prohibited
from
being
in
that
particular
business.
and
i
think,
the
most
prominent
discussion
of
what
is
quasi-criminal
was
in
the
recent
case
of
lopez-mendoza,
where
it
was
acknowledged
the
case,
although
purely
civil
in
nature,
there
was
some
discussion
about
what
constitutes
a
quasi-criminal
situation.
and
i
believe
that
this
case
falls
right
into
that
category,
and
it
is
analogous
to
the
situation
of
forfeiture
in
the
plymouth
sedan
case
where
a
property
right
is
forfeited,
action
of
forfeiture
is
taken
against
it,
a
revocation
is
forfeiture,
and
it
has
a
quasi-criminal
nature.
this
was
also
pointed
out
by
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
that
they
can
go
against
an
individual
in
this
kind
of
case
under
two
different
avenues,
but
they
are
basically
co-extensive
is
the
word
i
believe
they
used.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
my
answer
is
yes,
for
this
reason.
i
think
there
are
two
questions
that
need
to
be
asked
in
this
case.
one
is
does
it
apply?
and
i
believe
it
does.
if
you
have
gone
so
far
in
lopez-mendoza,
which
is
purely
civil,
as
indicated,
and
applied
the
rule,
then
it
applies
in
this
case.
then
you
go
to
the
balancing
test,
and
in
lopez-mendoza,
i
am
in
basic
agreement
with
the
end
result
of
the
balancing
test.
i
believe,
though,
that
applying
the
balancing
test
in
this
case,
we
don't
come
out
with
the
same
result
as
lopez-mendoza.
so
i
think
there
are
two
separate
questions:
application
of
the
rule
itself,
and
if
it
does
apply,
then
you
enter
into
the
balancing
situation.
but
i--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
with
one
plymouth
sedan,
and
going
back
to
boyd,
and
one
plymouth
sedan,
and
even
janis,
in
this
situation
of
an
intrasovereign
situation,
that
it
does
apply,
and
especially
after
you
have
already
said
in
lopez-mendoza,
which
is
purely
civil,
that
it
does.
i
don't
even
know
that
i
need
to
say
that
this
is
necessarily
quasi-criminal.
but
i
am,
because
i
am
relying
upon
the
plymouth
sedan.
i
think
it
is
not
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
i
think
that
the
way
these
decisions
in
this
court
have
come
down,
it
is
a
necessary
process
to
first
determine
does
it
apply.
now,
you
may
determine
it
doesn't
apply
for
the
reason
that
this
is
a
civil
situation
and
not
a
criminal
situation,
but
i
think
we
must
get
to
the
balancing
process
as
well.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
standard
that
should
be
applicable
whether
or
not
you
can
function
better,
not
with
the
fourth
amendment.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
--absolutely.
as
a
point
of
interest,
perhaps
only
interest,
i
was
not
involved
in
the
superior
court
level
of
this
or
the
supreme
court
in
rhode
island
state.
the
case,
when
certiorari
was
granted,
or
the
petition
was
requested,
went
to
the
rhode
island
attorney
general's
department.
as
i
understand
it,
they
weren't
pleased
with
necessarily
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
decision
and
didn't
want
to
take
the
time
to
act
to
sustain
it.
that's
when
i
got
the
call.
and
i
am
here
as
a
result
of
that.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
but
i
don't...
getting
back
to
what
you
are
asking,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
standard,
but
it
certainly
would
help
us,
it
would
help
the
attorney
general
in
the
state
of
rhode
island,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
necessarily
how
you
make
a
decision.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
which
i
have...
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
in
a
vacuum
he
would
like
that,
your
honor,
but
he
has
counsel
that...
and
if
i
were
faced,
and
i
am
his
counsel,
with
this
kind
of
a
situation,
i
would
have
gone
the
same
way
as
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
i
would
like
to
have
that.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
as
i
have
indicated
in
my
brief,
to
affirm
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
decision.
again,
it
is
not
function.
you
know,
you
are
saying
that
the
form
should
follow
what
your
function
is.
that's
not...
we
don't
function
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that
is
not
the
position
of
the
liquor
control
administrator,
your
honor,
and
has
not
been.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that,
your
honor.
well,
i
would
like
now
to
get
then
to
the
balancing
test,
and
i
did
want
to
point
out
that
because
of
the
quasi-criminal
nature
of
the
case,
that
i
do
believe
that
the
rule
applies.
but
the
balancing
test,
as
i
pointed
out
to
justice
o'connor...
i
am
not
sure
she
agrees
with
me
necessarily,
but
is
the
next
application
that
we
must
undertake
to
determine
if
the
costs
and
the
benefits
warrant
its
application.
i
have
pointed
out
and
i
have
made
particularly
contrast
to
lopez-mendoza
which
i
think
went
to
great
lengths
at
presenting
and
weighing
the
various
factors
that
go
into
a
situation
of
cost
and
benefit,
and
as
far
as
the
benefit
is
concerned,
the
significant
benefit
i
have
is
we
are
faced
with
a
situation
that
is
opposite
of
janis
that
we
have
an
intrasovereign
situation.
the
same
police
officer
that
went
upon
the
premises
with
the
warrant
is
the
same
police
officer
that
would
testify,
and
probably
did
testify,
with
respect
to
the
liquor
control
situation.
they
both,
the
officer
is
interested
in
both
situations,
and
i
maintain
that
under
the
case
law,
that
it
is
sufficiently
derivative,
the
two
actions
of
criminal
in
the
courts
and
of
the
administrative
hearing
before
the
liquor
board,
that
the
rule
should
apply.
and
i
believe
that
this
was
determined
to
some
degree
in
janis.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
deterrence,
one
of
the
things
that
i
have
experienced
in
doing
the
research
on
this
was
that
deterrence
generally
is
used
in
a
singular
sense
as
against
the
offending
officer,
as
it
were.
on
the
other
hand,
when
we
are
looking
at
the
costs,
we
look
at
them
in
a
pluralistic
view
as
to
the
cost
to
society,
and
i
would
like
to
maintain
and
submit
to
the
court
that
i
am
in
agreement
with
mr.
justice
brennan
when
he
stated
in
leon
that
the
deterrence
should
be
pluralistic
in
the
sense
that
what
we
are
seeking
in
deterrence
is
institutional
compliance,
and
i
think
that
sometimes
in
making
the
weighing,
balancing
situation,
the
scales
are
somewhat
thrown
out
of
function
when
we
don't
stop
to
look
at
the
institutional
compliance
that
we
are
looking
for,
and
we
focus
rather
on
the
singular
activity
of
an
officer.
and
so
that
in
determining
the
situation
of
cost,
i
don't
believe
that,
as
was
argued
by
my
opponent,
that
we
can
simply
look
at
the
sphere
of
influence
of
the
officer
himself.
i
think
we
have
to
look
beyond
that
in
a
pluralistic
sense,
and
i
think
that
would
counteract
the
pluralistic
viewpoint
we
take
when
we
determine
what
it
will
cost
to
implement
the
rule.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
hines,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
there
is
such
a
statute.
the
only
difficulty
with
that
statute,
your
honor,
as
i
read
it
to
you,
its
focus
is
basically
upon
compliance
with
liquor
matters
and
not
with
other
aspects
of
the
law.
but
we
do
have
that
broad
statute.
now,
i
wanted
to
in
my
conclusion,
your
honor,
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
presently
the
exclusionary
rule
is
considered
a
judicially
created
remedial
device,
and
it
is
restricted
to
use
where
its
objections...
objectives,
rather,
are
best
served.
and
despite
this
attitude,
i
think
we
also
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
framework
of
mr.
justice
black
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
plymouth
sedan
where
he
also
states
that
we
must
be
mindful
on
the
principle
that
constitutional
provisions
for
the
security
of
personal
property
should
be
also
liberally
construed.
so
although
we
have
a
situation
where
i
can
understand
the
court's
feeling
that
we
have
a
remedial
situation
with
the
judicially
created
exclusionary
rule,
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
must
take
into
account
the
fact
that
we
do
have
a
fourth
amendment
situation
which
is
fundamental,
and
much
recognition
should
be
given
to
it
as
well.
and
under
those
circumstances,
a
weigh...
even
with
the
balancing
of
the
costs
and
benefits,
as
i
have
outlined
in
my
brief,
i
think
the
objective
of
deterring
fourth
amendment
violations
requires
the
result
of
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
to
be
affirmed.
and
i
say
this
and
would
point
out
that
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
also
recognized,
a
chief
justice
burger
pointed
out
to
me,
that
under
the
21st
amendment
there
is
a
strong
police
power
permitting
very
vigorous
regulation
of
liquor
matters.
that
is
working,
and
it
has
worked
despite
the
fact
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
it
has
worked
because
of
the
framework
of
decisional
law
that
has
resulted
from
that
21st
amendment.
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
noted
that
because
that
point
was
brought
up
by
my
adversary
now
in
that
case,
and
they
recognized
and
pointed
out,
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
that
there
were
other
measures
and
alternatives
which
adequately
served
that
purpose,
and
more
importantly,
the
interest
in
doing
that,
regulating
the
liquor
control,
was
not
as
significant
as
giving
recognition
to
fourth
amendment
rights.
and
i
believe
that
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
properly
applied
the
rule,
properly
entered
a
weighing
and
balancing
situation
as
to
both
cost
and
benefit,
and
rendered
a
proper
decision
which
i
request
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
