justice
white
well,
what
did
the
warrant
affidavit
say?
justice
white
well,
they
must
have
explained,
to
get
the
warrant
issued,
they
had
to
say
what
they
thought
they
were
going
to
find.
justice
white
and
demonstrate
reasonable
cause.
justice
white
well,
what
did
it
say?
justice
white
well,
then,
that's...
that's
their
asserted
purpose
in
going
there.
justice
white
and
i
thought
you
said
that
they
were...
that
they
were
seeking
to
enforce
the
criminal
laws
rather
than
the
licensing
laws.
justice
white
well,
what
is...
is
the
law
in
your
state
that
people
who
are
enforcing
the
licensing
laws,
the
liquor
laws,
may
enter
a
premises
to
inspect
without
any
warrant
at
all?
justice
white
well,
where
did
they
find
these
stolen
goods?
justice
white
the
officers--
justice
white
--but
the
two...
but
the
liquor
laws
are
enforced
by
the
same
police
who
enforce
the
criminal
laws
there,
aren't
they?
justice
white
so
these
same
police
officers
could
have
entered
the
lounge
any
time
they
wanted
to
to
see
if
the
liquor
laws
were
being--
justice
white
counsel,
i
take
it
that
most
of
the
cases
on
this
point
around
the
country
are
against
you,
are
they,
or
not?
justice
white
i
don't
see
much
discussion
of
those
cases
in
your
brief.
justice
white
there
are
other
cases
to
the
contrary,
i
take
it.
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
at
the
outset--
justice
white
--the
issue
in
the
court
below
was
whether
or
not
the
administrator
was
correct
in
setting
aside
the
license
revocation.
justice
white
and
the
administrator's
decision
was
affirmed.
justice
white
and
so
it
really
is
a
license
case,
a
licensing
case,
and
i
wonder
what
your
answer
is
to
justice
stevens'
question,
why
isn't
this
case
moot?
justice
white
what
happens
to
a
liquor
license
that
a
tavern
owns
when
it
closes?
can
they
sell
it,
transfer
it?
justice
white
of
course,
if
they...
if
it
had
been
properly
revoked,
they
couldn't
sell
it
or
transfer
it.
justice
white
but
is
there...
did
somebody
want
to
succeed
these
owners
in
that
same
place
and
sell
liquor
under
that
license?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
let's
assume
the...
i'm
still
asking
whether
there
is
a
live
controversy
here.
is
it
possible
that
this
license
is...
if
we
affirmed
here,
is
it
possible
that
that
license
would
still
be
in
existence?
justice
white
well,
it
might
be
attached
to
that
place,
though.
justice
white
it
isn't.
justice
white
well,
what
would
happen
to
the
license
if
we
reversed?
justice
white
well,
why
wouldn't
it?
what
if
we
said
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
excluding
the
evidence?
justice
white
well,
your
client...
and
your
client
is
the
commissioner,
is
that
right?
justice
white
well,
suppose
we
reversed
and
said
the
evidence
was
properly
admissible?
what
would
your
client
do?
justice
white
no,
no,
in
this
case.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
i
know,
but
they
revoked
the
license.
justice
white
and
you
said...
and
you
reinstated
it.
justice
white
on
an
erroneous
basis.
justice
white
and
now
you
are
defending
the
state
court's
decision.
justice
white
not
much
of
a
case
here,
is
there?
justice
white
except
that
officers
to
enforce
the
liquor
laws
cannot
enter
without
a
license
and
go
to
locked
doors.
justice
white
do
you
think
they
could
go
and
search
bureau
drawers?
justice
white
suppose
they
wanted
to
go
in
and
hunt
for
some
drugs,
and
they
went
in,
and
if
they...
in
the
back
end
of
the
tavern
was
a
living
quarters?
do
you
think
they
could
go
in
the
living
quarters?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
they
could
look
in
a
jar,
look
in
a--
justice
white
--do
you
think
they
could
open
the
cash
register?
justice
white
well,
i
would
have
thought,
though,
that...
i
would
have
thought
that
if
your
client
determined
in
his
own
mind
that
he
had
erroneously
reinstated
the
license,
that
the
could
consider
this
evidence,
and
that
there
was
evidence--
justice
white
--i
would
think
he
could
go
back
and
say
this
license
should
have
been
revoked,
and
i
am
now
going
to
revoke
it.
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know--
justice
white
--anybody
who
took,
the
transferree
of
his
license
took
it
at
his
risk
and
his
peril.
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
it
is
like
issuing
a
new
license?
justice
white
and
that
that
is
like
issuing
a
new
license
to
a
new
person.
justice
white
well,
they
have...
i
was
going
to
say,
they
have
already
decided
this
case
the
way
you
want
it
decided.
justice
white
i
would
think
you,
with
your
first
point
out
of
the
box
here
would
be
to
say
that
the
case
is
moot,
you
should
just
dismiss
it.
that
leaves
the
law
in
rhode
island
exactly
the
way
you
want
it.
justice
white
unless
we
held
it
was
moot
and
vacated
the
judgment
below.
justice
white
do
you
think
we
have
the
authority
to
vacate
advisory
opinions
of
state
supreme
courts?
justice
white
you
mean
as
long
as
you
have
that
broad
statutory
authority
to
search
without
a
warrant.
