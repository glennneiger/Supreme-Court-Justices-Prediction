justice
o'connor
well,
in
fact,
isn't
that
the
best
rule
for
both
sides
at
the
trial
court
level?
let's
forget
about
the
appellate
procedure.
the
trial
court
has
invested
a
lot
of
time
in
the
trial
of
a
case.
witnesses
have
been
on
the
stand,
everyone
has
been
put
out
in
terms
of
spending
time
and
effort
on
a
case,
and
you
reach
closing
argument.
why
shouldn't
you
give
the
trial
judge
the
first
opportunity
to
tell
the
jury
to
disregard
some
improper
argument,
whether
it's
being
made
by
defense
counsel
or
the
prosecutor?
justice
o'connor
why
isn't
it
the
preferred
course?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
trial
court
is
certainly
in
a
position
to
advise
the
jury
that
the
prosecutor's
belief
in
the
veracity
of
a
witness
is
irrelevant.
justice
o'connor
mr.
mcconnell,
what
if
the
defense
counsel
got
up
and
argued
something
along
the
following
lines:
the
defendant
has
nothing
to
hide.
could
the
prosecutor
then
comment
in
closing
argument
on
the
fact
that
the
defendant
didn't
take
a
stand,
as
invite,
being
invited?
justice
o'connor
that
would
constitute
so-called
plain
error.
would
you
agree
that
there
are
circumstances
when,
even
though
the
defense
counsel
might
have
opened
the
door
a
crack,
and
the
response
would
amount
to
plain
error?
justice
o'connor
well,
which
ones?
could
you
identify
any
that
were
not
responsive
to
your
argument?
justice
o'connor
but
that
was
responsive
to
your
statement
that
nobody
believed,
including
the
prosecutor
or
himself,
in
your
client's
guilt.
justice
o'connor
may
i
ask
why
no
objection
was
made
by
you,
as
defense
counsel,
to
anything
that
you
thought
he
said
was
improper
at
the
time?
justice
o'connor
and
it's
also
possible,
isn't
it,
to
approach
the
bench
and
make
an
objection
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
if
you
really
thought
the
prosecutor
was
getting
out
of
line?
justice
o'connor
but
none
of
that
was
done,
of
course.
