marshall
but,
if
you
take
that
position,
does
that
authorize
you
to
do
wrong?
justice
marshall
if
you
voluntarily
pass
up
your
opportunity
to
object,
can
you
then
use
that
as
the
bulwark
of
doing
wrong
in
your
argument?
justice
marshall
shouldn't
the
judge
do
that?
justice
marshall
and
the
judge
can
only
do
it
if
you
object.
justice
marshall
is
it
part
of
your
position
that
the
defendant
failed
to
object
to
what
you
said?
justice
marshall
well,
then
can't
the
defendant
raise
the
point
that
you
didn't
object?
isn't
what's
good
for
the
goose
good
for
the
gander?
justice
marshall
but
the
trial
is
in
a
better
position
than
you
and
i.
justice
marshall
i
thought
your
position
was
it
wasn't
error.
justice
marshall
at
one
time
you
say
it's
not
error,
and
another
time
it's
not
plain.
justice
marshall
you
take
both
positions.
justice
marshall
isn't
that
equaled
out?
the
government
didn't
make
objection,
and
the
defendant
didn't
make
objection.
isn't
objection
pointed
out?
justice
marshall
both
sides
gave
up
the
right
to
object.
justice
marshall
not
in
my
book.
i
don't
think
two
wrongs
make
a
right.
justice
marshall
improper
and
unethical.
it's
unethical
for
a
lawyer,
in
argument,
to
comment
on
his
personal
views.
isn't
that
right?
justice
marshall
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
appellate
process,
the
right
of
the
trial
judge
to
move?
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
appellate
practice,
does
it?
justice
marshall
mr.
bailey.
justice
marshall
suppose
in
this
particular
case,
after
you
made
this
statement
that
everybody
at
this
table
agrees
to
this,
and
the
prosecutor
got
up
and
said,
"well,
i
object
to
that
statement
because
i
don't
agree
to
it.
"
and
then
said
exactly
what
he
said
there,
would
that
be
objectionable?
justice
marshall
no,
i
said
he
makes
that
whole
statement.
in
his
objection
he
makes
that
whole
statement.
justice
marshall
i
mean
if
he
gets
up
and...
if
you
get
up
there
and
say,
"the
prosecutor
agrees
with
me
that
this
man
is
innocent.
"
and
the
prosecutor
gets
up
and
says,
"i
don't
agree
with
it
at
all.
"
"i
think
he's
guilty.
"
would
there
be
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
marshall
yes.
you
shouldn't
have
said--
justice
marshall
--well,
what's
wrong
with
it?
that's
his
objection.
you're
telling
a
lie.
justice
marshall
he's
no
more
a
witness
than
you
were.
