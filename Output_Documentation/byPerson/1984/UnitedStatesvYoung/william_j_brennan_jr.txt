justice
jr.
what
i'm
getting
back
to,
a
long,
long
time,
but
i
recall
in
my
own
experience
as
a
trial
judge
that
somebody
in
summation,
whether
prosecutor
or
defense
counsel,
stepped
outside
proper
limits,
his
adversary
had
better
get
up
and
object
to
give
me
a
chance
to
say
to
the
jury,
ignore
it,
or
forget
it,
or
something
like
that.
isn't
that
the
sensible
rule?
justice
jr.
mr.
bailey,
what's
happened
in
this
case,
what
i
understood
was
the
tenth
circuit
rule,
that
if
you
didn't
object,
then
you're
foreclosed
from
raising
it.
isn't
there
a
tenth
circuit
rule
that
says
that,
whether
it's
prosecutor
or
defense
counsel,
if
your
adversary
goes
out
of
bounds,
you
have
to
object
if
you're
going
to,
in
order
to
give
the
trial
judge
a
chance
to
correct.
justice
jr.
that
is
exactly
what
the
result
was
in
this
case.
