chief
justice
burger
is
this
the
case
where
there
was
no
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
burger
in
one
of
our
cases
today,
there
was
no
oral
argument.
it's
a
decision
on
the
briefs.
but
no
matter,
we'll
check
that.
mr.
mcconnell,
may
i
just
ask
at
the
outset,
is
there
a
tenth
circuit
rule
that
if
either
prosecutor
or
defense
counsel
thinks
that
his
adversary
has
gone
out
of
bounds,
that
the
rule
requires
that
he
object
to
give
the
trial
judge
an
opportunity
to
correct?
chief
justice
burger
well,
aren't
you
entitled
to
take
the
position
that
the
prosecution
had
its
option?
it
could
object
at
the
time
and
ask
the
court
to
instruct
the
jury
to
disregard
the
false
statements
and
to
reprimand
counsel,
or
wait
and
do
what
he
did;
respond
and
challenge
the
statements.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we'll
resume
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
mcconnell.
mr.
mcconnell,
you
may
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bailey.
chief
justice
burger
how
does
this
bear
on
the
legitimacy
of
the
comments
of
either
counsel?
chief
justice
burger
what
was
your
intent
in
saying
nobody
at
this
table
believes
thus
and
so?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
not
agree,
or
do
you
agree
that
a
lawyer
objecting
to
argument
of
another
lawyer,
interrupting,
takes
considerable
risk
of
having
the
jury
have
a
negative
reaction
to
the
interruption?
chief
justice
burger
so
that
probably
explains
why
you
didn't
object,
and
why
the
prosecutor
didn't
object.
chief
justice
burger
does
that
not
suggest,
then,
that
lawyers
and
trial
judges
should
be
allowed
quite
a
latitude
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
you
wanted
to
let
the
error
stay
in
the
record
without
giving
the
trial
judge
a
chance
to
correct
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
didn't
you
suggest
that
the
prosecutor
not
only
lacked
faith
in
his
own
case,
but
didn't
believe
in
it
at
all?
chief
justice
burger
that's
the
way
i
read
your
statement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
mcconnell?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apparently
not.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
