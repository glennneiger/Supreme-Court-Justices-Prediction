justice
stevens
mr.
mcconnell,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
either
the
defense
argument
was
improper
or
not.
which
is
your
position?
justice
stevens
then
was
there
not
a
duty
to
object,
as
justice
o'connor
suggests?
justice
stevens
if
he
wants
to
take
advantage
of
it,
to
object
rather
than
waiting
until
it's
his
turn
to
argue
and
then
making
an
improper
argument
in
response.
justice
stevens
i
understand
that
ultimately,
but
we're
talking,
first
of
all,
about
what
would
be
the
proper
procedure
in
the
trial
court.
maybe
it
wasn't
reversible
error.
i
understand
you
have
a
separate
argument
on
that.
would
you
not
agree
that
the
right
thing
for
the
prosecutor
to
do
was
to
object
to
that
argument,
rather
than
save
it,
and
then
make
an
improper
argument
himself?
justice
stevens
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
in
this
case,
because
you're
relying
on
what
you
say
was
improper
argument
as
a
justification
for
the
response.
justice
stevens
i
understand
all
that,
but
can't
we
agree
that
the
argument
was
improper
by
defense
counsel?
otherwise,
you
have
no
justification
for
the
response.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
and
that
would
be
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
therefore,
should
not
the
government
have
objected?
justice
stevens
mr.
mcconnell,
do
you
think
it
would
ever
be
appropriate
for
a
court
of
appeals,
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power
with
this
kind
of
an
issue,
to
take
into
account
similar
comments
in
other
cases.
say
it
had
a
recurring
problem
in
the
circuit;
they
thought
the
prosecutors
needed
to
realize
the
court
was
serious
about
enforcing
a
rule.
or
do
they
always
have
to
confine
themselves
to
the
particular
case
before
them?
justice
stevens
of
course,
mr.
bailey,
we
don't
know.
i
mean,
of
course,
accept
your
representation
that's
how
it
was
done,
but
that
doesn't
come
through
in
the
transcript.
but
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
prevail
for
this
to
be
plain
error;
right?
justice
stevens
therefore,
do
we
not
have
to
assume
that
if
you
had
made
an
objection,
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
sustained
it?
justice
stevens
and,
therefore,
i
can't
understand
why
you
didn't
make
the
objection,
because
i
don't
see
how
that
could
have
possibly
hurt
you.
justice
stevens
but
you
certainly
aren't
going
to
gamble
on
a
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
getting
your
client
off.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
bailey,
again
if
i
may
just
throw
this
thought
out.
did
you
make
any
request
of
the
trial
judge
or
any
instruction
of
the
jury
after
the
argument
was
over,
so
you
would
have
avoided
the
harm
of
interruption?
justice
stevens
what
about...
did
you
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
this
ground?
justice
stevens
if,
at
the
close,
as
part
of
the
instructions,
the
trial
judge
had
said,
"now,
both
of
these
lawyers
have
been
engaging
in
expressing
some
personal
opinions,
and
i
remind
you
they
have
no
place
in
the
process
of
deciding.
"
would
that
have
cured
all
of
this?
justice
stevens
mr.
bailey,
can
i
ask
one
other
procedural
question?
justice
stevens
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
this
case
was
apparently
not
argued
with
the
court
of
appeals.
did
you
get
notice
that
it
was
not
to
be
argued?
how
do
they
do
that
there?
