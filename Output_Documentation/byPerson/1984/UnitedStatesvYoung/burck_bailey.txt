mr.
burck
bailey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
bill
young's
defense
was
that
he
had
no
fraudulent
intent
whatsoever.
the
evidence
showed
that
he
had
worked
for
apco
oil
company
for,
oh,
several
years
and
his
best
friends
were
the
people
he
was
dealing
with
on
this
transaction.
apco's
refinery
at
cyril,
oklahoma,
a
small
town
in
southern
oklahoma,
was
chronically
in
need
of
product.
it
was
land-locked
and
had
difficulty
getting
product
down
there,
and
the
evidence
showed
it
could
not
very
efficiently
meet
its
fixed
costs
without
a
lot
of
product.
so
the
president
or
the
vice
president
of
apco
in
charge
of
that
end
of
their
business,
a
man
named
hugh
bradley,
asked
billy
young
if
he
could
get
any
product.
billy
had
been
called
by
a
fellow
named
ross
many
times,
saying
that
he
had
fuel
oil
he
could
certify
as
crude
oil
under
the
then-existing
tier
procedures
under
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
energy.
and
bill
young
then
bought
condensate,
which
is
very
rich
in
hydrocarbons...
it's
gathered
at
the
wellhead...
and
paid
more
for
it
than
he
could
charge,
for
that
matter,
and
blended
the
condensate
with
fuel
oil,
and
his
testimony
was
he
was
putting
the
barrel
back
together.
there
were
two
things
that
strongly,
we
felt,
supported
the
proposition
that
he
was
acting
without
any
fraudulent
intent.
first,
for
the
six
or
seven
months
that
compton
was
selling
this
product
to
apco
oil
company
at
cyril,
they
had
no
difficulty
with
their
output
of
the
refinery.
they
still
got
the
same
gasoline,
the
same
products
they
always
had.
it
was
only
after
another
company,
totally
related
to
any
of
the
parties
or
procedures
in
this
case,
started
selling
to
apco
pure
burner
fuel,
a
residue
product
that
has
no
other
products
in
it,
that
the
apco
oil
company
noticed
a
change
in
their
output
and
tested
it,
and
found
that
there
was
fuel
oil
going
in.
also,
the
government
witnesses
who
knew
mr.
young
testified
that
he
was
an
honorable
and
honest
person,
a
person
of
integrity
and,
in
their
opinion,
had
no
intent
to
defraud
apco.
in
fact,
hugh
bradley,
the
very
person
that
he
contracted
with,
the
apco
vice
president,
so
testified.
so
it
was
in
that
situation
that
we
reached
closing
argument.
the
government
used
the
blending
as
an
indication
of
fraud.
that
was
the
view
the
government
took
of
it;
that
yes,
that
increased
the
gravity
of
the
oil;
that
was
designed
to
cover
up
the
fraud.
young's
version
was,
no,
that's
just
quite
the
reverse.
it
was
designed
to
give
apco
the
equivalent
of
what
they
were
getting
elsewhere.
mr.
burck
bailey
it's
because
of
the
issue
of
good
faith,
your
honor,
and
that
was
the
issue
in
the
closing
summation.
when
counsel
was
confronted,
when
counsel
for
the
government
was
confronted
with
this
state
of
affairs...
this
was
immediately
after
mr.
young
had
testified
that
he
was
putting
the
barrel
back
together,
he
had
no
intent
to
defraud
anybody...
that,
we
submit,
the
prosecutor
felt
he
needed
something
outside
the
evidence
to
carry
the
day,
and
started
in
the
closing
part
of
his...
excuse
me...
the
opening
part
of
his
closing
argument,
to
talk
about
the
victims.
that
word
had
never
been
used
in
this
trial.
no
one
had
ever
used
the
word
"victim".
but
the
prosecutor
says,
"they
say
there's
no
victim".
there's
never
been
any
such
statement
made
in
the
whole
transcript.
"you
and
i
are
victims
because
we're
getting
charged
for
this
indirectly.
"
no
testimony
at
all,
your
honor,
that
that
was
so.
no
testimony
that
remotely
supports
that.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
think
a
great
deal
of
latitude
should
be
permitted
if
there
is
any
evidence
to
support
it,
your
honor.
here,
we
submit
there
is
no
evidence
at
all.
it
is
quite
the
reverse.
apco
stated
that
they
had
not
been
requested,
that
is,
their
accountant,
to
make
any
kind
of
reimbursement
or
any
kind
of
adjustment
under
the
denver
bailing
regulations.
there
was
no
evidence
whatever.
mr.
burck
bailey
oh,
i
don't
think
that,
your
honor,
but
there
should
be
some
proof
that
someone
lost
something.
and
here,
there
was
no
such
proof.
it
seems
to
me
there
should
be
some.
that's
my
submission.
and
this
went
on
for
several
pages,
talking
about
fictitious
victims
and
talking...
also,
the
fbi
agent
who
investigated
the
case
said
that
he
had
studied
it
for
a
year
or
more,
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
money
coming
back
to
bill
young.
mr.
burck
bailey
yes,
your
honor.
when
i
made
my
closing
argument,
i
said
this
is
what
they're
complaining
about.
and
i
submit
to
you...
well,
let
me
back
up.
the
indictment
says
that
billy
young
is
charged
with
intending
to
devise
a
scheme
to
defraud
apco
and
to
obtain
money
and
property
by
false
and
fraudulent
pretenses.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
there's
not
a
person
in
this
courtroom,
including
those
sitting
at
this
table,
who
think
that
billy
young
intended
to
defraud
to
apco.
now,
if
you
think
that
billy
young
intended
to
defraud
apco,
if
that
was
his
scheme
and
intent,
filly
young
is
dead.
but
that's
an
element
of
this
charge
that
the
government
is
obligated
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
burck
bailey
yes,
i
did,
under
what
i've
just
described,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
has.
mr.
burck
bailey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
say
i
never
recall
a
case
in
20
years
where
virtually
every
government
witness
that
was
called,
that
knew
billy,
testified
to
his
honorableness,
his
integrity,
his
rectitude,
and
i
say
that
makes
the
case
unique.
and
it
goes
to
undercut
any
contention
that
that
man
had
any
intention
to
defraud
anybody.
i
think
that
was
a
fair
comment
on
the
evidence.
it
was
what
the
testimony
was.
and
then
in
the
closing
portion
of
the
government's
argument,
the
prosecutor
just
went
berserk.
he
went
far
in
excess
of
what
any
reasonable
rule
would
permit.
question:
do
you
think
that
any
of
the
comments
were
not
responsive
to
your
own
closing
argument?
your
honor,
i
think...
yes,
some
were
not,
and
i
think
they
were
excessive.
i
think
the
first
comments--
mr.
burck
bailey
--i
will.
i
think
the
repetition
of
the
statement
that
in
his
opinion
it's
a
fraud,
that
the
jurors
are
not
doing
their
duty
as
jurors
if
they
don't
find
him
guilty--
mr.
burck
bailey
--i
think
that's
an
improper
comment,
your
honor.
but
my
observation
backs
up
further
than
that,
your
honor.
at
the
outset
of
the
close,
the
prosecutor
says,
"i
think
he
said",...
to
me...
"that
not
anyone
sitting
at
this
table
thinks
that
mr.
young
intended
to
defraud
apco.
"
mr.
burck
bailey
"well,
i
was
sitting
there,
and
i
think
he
was.
"
"i
think
he
got
85
cents
a
barrel
for
every
one
of
those
117,250
barrels
he
called,
and
every
bit
of
the
money
they
made
on
that,
he
got
1
percent
of.
"
so
i
think
that's
totally
incorrect,
your
honor.
that's
a
misstatement
of...
there's
no
support
of
that
in
record
at
all,
that
he
got...
that
there
was
any
profit
at
all
on
the
sales
to
apco.
there
was
testimony
that--
mr.
burck
bailey
--well,
that
he
gave
his
opinion
of
guilt,
which
we
think
is
grossly
improper.
and
then
didn't
stop
there.
if
that
had
been--
mr.
burck
bailey
--i
think
if
he
had
stopped
there,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be
a
closer
case.
i
think
that
he,
under
the
tenth
circuit,
of
course,
he
was
obligated
to
object
to
my
closing
argument
if
he
thought
it
was
in
any
way
improper.
mr.
burck
bailey
our
understanding
of
the
tenth
circuit
rule
was,
if
he
objected
to
my
closing
statement,
then
that
was
the
way
he
preserved
his
record,
and
i
was
not
obligated
to
object
to
his
because
it
was
plain
error.
in
retrospect,
i
don't
know
whether
we
would
do
the
same
thing
again.
the
point
made
so
often
in
these
other
cases
from
the
fifth
and
sixth
circuit
is
that
it
emphasizes
this
point
to
the
jury
and
only
magnifies
the
opinion
of
the
prosecutor
to
get
up
and
call
attention
to
that
in
the
jury's
presence.
and
i
think
there
is
substantial--
mr.
burck
bailey
--i
did
not.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
that
could
well
be.
mr.
burck
bailey
oh,
it
could
have
been
done.
mr.
burck
bailey
that
was
not
done.
he
goes
on
to
say,
"i
don't
know
what
you
call
it;
i
call
it
fraud.
"
"i
think
it's
a
fraud.
"
and
then
at
the--
mr.
burck
bailey
--your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
advanced
for
that.
i
think
that...
let
me
see
if
i
can
put
my
hands
right
quickly
on
some
of
those
points.
mr.
burck
bailey
yes.
well,
here,
for
example,
is
a
statement
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
united
states
v
bess.
"an
assistant
united
states
attorney
purports
to
represent
the
people
of
the
united
states,
and
thus
carries
a
special
aura
of
legitimacy
about
him.
"
"implicit
in
an
assertion
of
personal
belief
that
a
defendant
is
guilty
is
an
implied
statement
that
the
prosecutor,
by
virtue
of
his
experience,
knowledge,
and
intellect
has
concluded
that
the
jury
must
convict.
"
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
your
honor,
it's
just
totally
unethical.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
because
it
makes
the
prosecutor
a
witness.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
think
it's
improper
for
a
defense
lawyer
to
say
his
client's
not
guilty.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
even
be
proper.
there
are
cases
that
discuss
that
problem.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
the
statement
here
from
mr.
drinker,
writing
on
legal
ethics
in
this
case,
which
is
quoted,
i
think
addresses
that
point,
your
honor:
"there
are
several
reasons
for
the
rule,
long
established,
that
a
lawyer
may
not
properly
state
his
personal
belief,
either
to
the
court
or
to
the
jury,
in
the
soundness
of
his
case.
"
"in
the
first
place,
his
personal
belief
has
no
real
bearing
on
the
issue.
"
mr.
burck
bailey
i
think
that's
slightly
different,
your
honor,
and
i--
mr.
burck
bailey
--i
think
that
one
could
get
by
with
that
sort
of
statement.
it
seems
to
me
it's
getting
close
to
the
line.
but
that's
not
the
case
we
have
here.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
think
that's
very
different
from
saying,
"i
say
that
it's
a
fraud.
"
"i
think
he
intended
to
fraud.
"
to
me,
that's
very
different,
your
honor.
and
it's
recognized
in
cases
as
being
very
different.
mr.
burck
bailey
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
burck
bailey
i
think
it
would
be
a
more
appropriate
response
than
what
was
done.
"i
object;
i
don't
agree.
"
and
i
suppose
that
would
be
the
end
of
that,
and
we
wouldn't
have
all
of
this
statement
here
later
on.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
i
think
it
is
clearly
reversible
error,
your
honor.
if
he
makes
this
whole
statement
that...
for
example,
he
goes
on
to
say
that--
mr.
burck
bailey
--i
think
there
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
would
take
the
position
that
there
would
be,
but
that's
not
this
case.
i
didn't
give
my
personal
opinion
on
innocence.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
think
his
objection
is,
your
honor,
we
object
to
counsel
stating
what
is
in
the
minds
of
others.
i
don't
think
that
you
then
use
that
as
a
platform
to
make
a
speech
to
the
jury
as
a
witness.
it
seems
to
me
that's
totally
improper.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
i
don't...
your
honor,
i
agree.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
was
anything
stated
by
me
that
put
my
personal
testimony
before
the
jury.
he
goes
on
to
say--
mr.
burck
bailey
--it
was
meant
to
be
a
comment
on
the
evidence,
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
intent
to
defraud,
your
honor.
there
was
none.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
don't
recall
saying
anything
quite
like
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
if
there
was
such
a
statement
made,
the
prosecutor
has
an
obligation
to
protest
it
if
he
doesn't
like
that.
he
goes
on
to
say,
"i
don't
think
you're
doing
your
job
as
jurors
in
finding
facts
as
opposed
to
the
law
that
this
judge
is
going
to
instruct.
"
"do
you
think
that's
honor
or
integrity?
"
"stand
up
here
in
an
oklahoma
courtroom
and
say
that's
honor
and
integrity.
"
"i
don't
believe
it.
"
it
was
an
invasion
of
the
province
of
the
jury.
it
was
highly
improper,
and
it
was
rendered
in
an
extremely
aggressive
and
loud
finger-jabbing
tone.
it
was
not
in
the
measured
tones
of
counsel
here
today.
mr.
burck
bailey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
think
you'd
have
to
assume
that.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
there
were
two.
the
first
reason
was
that
the
way
we
construed
the
tenth
circuit
rule,
it
was
not...
we
felt
that
there
was
plain
error
committed
under
the--
mr.
burck
bailey
--there
was
the
deep
concern
that
this
would
only
emphasize
this
to
the
jury.
it
had
already
been
said.
it's
not
like
an
objection
to
an
improper
question.
this
was
already
out
there.
and
maybe
in
retrospect,
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
done
so.
i
take
comfort
in
the
notion
that
all
these
cases
that
we
have
cited,
where
there
is
no
objection
made,
that
was
done
by
a
lot
better
lawyers
than
i,
and
they
apparently
reached
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
burck
bailey
very
much
so,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
think
that's
very
true,
your
honor.
it
does
have
a
negative
impression
to
the
jury.
they
resent
it,
i
think.
i
think
it
works
to
the
detriment
of
counsel
and
his
client.
mr.
burck
bailey
oh,
i
think
they
should
be
allowed
latitude,
considerable
latitude,
and
i
think
that
that's
done
all
the
time,
and
properly
so.
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that
one
cannot
have
a
prosecutor...
here,
the
prosecutor,
at
the
very
first
sentence
of
his
opening
statement,
said
"i
am
a
trial
attorney
from
the
united
states
department
of
justice,
the
fraud
section,
in
washington,
d.c.
and
i
am
here
to--
"
mr.
burck
bailey
--i
think
that's
in
with
what
they
refer
to
as
aura,
the
power
and
prestige
and
legitimacy
that
is
very
strong.
and
when
he
gets
up
and
says,
"i
think,
regardless
of
the
evidence,
i
think...
i'm
telling
you
that
i
am
now
becoming
an
expert
witness.
"
"i
am
testifying.
"
"and
i
think
that
the
man
is
guilty.
"
that's
just
wholly
improper
and
carries
a
weight,
as
this
court
noted
in
united
states
v.
berger,
that
transcends
vastly
anything
that
can
be
done
to
offset
it.
there
is
no
response
possible
at
that
point.
mr.
burck
bailey
no.
did
not.
and
that
is
a
tighter
fit,
i
think,
your
honor.
that
is
what
i
looked
back
on
and
wondered.
i
think
it
probably
would
have
been
no
good.
i
don't
think
it
would
have
done
any
good,
but
had
it
been
done,
there
is
the
tactical
consideration
of
yes,
you
get
some
kind
of
instruction
that
statements
by
counsel
are
not
evidence,
which
was
incidentally
said
by
the
judge
anyway
at
the
very
outset,
but
does
that
rob
you
of
your
possibility
on
appeal?
you
know,
they
say
it's
been
corrected.
mr.
burck
bailey
no.
went
straight
to
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
burck
bailey
no.
frankly,
never
thought
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
burck
bailey
my
understanding
of
the
tenth
circuit
rule
has
always
been
that
the
prosecutor
is
obligated
to
object
to
defense
counsel's
statements
and
cannot
respond
to
them
improperly,
and
if
they
do
so
and
express
their
own
opinion,
it's
plain
error.
and
you
do
not...
defense
counsel
is
not
required
or
obligated
to
object
to
an
expression
of
a
personal
opinion
of
guilt.
mr.
burck
bailey
that's
correct.
mr.
burck
bailey
no.
the
truth
is,
your
honor,
that
it
never
occurred
to
me.
but
i
was
just
responding
to
justice
steven's
remarks
that
one
can
see
in
retrospect
where,
from
a
tactical
point
of
view,
you
could
come
to
that
conclusion;
that,
well,
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
jury
has
been
fatally
prejudiced
by
what
has
been
said,
and
no
curative
instruction,
as
is
pointed
out
in
some
of
these
cases,
would
rectify
that
or
cure
it.
but
if
you
ask
for
it,
and
it
was
granted,
then
presumably
you
would
be
in
a
dramatically
weakened
position
to
argue
on
appeal.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
certainly
hope
so,
your
honor.
i
certainly
hope
so.
mr.
burck
bailey
not
in
my
judgment,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
statements
of
the
prosecutor,
of
his
personal
opinion
of
guilt
of
the
defendant,
cannot
be
cured
by
any
curative
instruction.
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
do
that.
i
think
that
the
weight
that
that
carries
is
so
heavy,
that
there
is
no
way
to
cure
it.
and
it
simply
cannot
be
permitted.
the
statement
by
this
court
in
berger
that
the
prosecutor
has
a
duty
to
try
the
case
fairly,
not
just
to
see
victory,
and
that
he
cannot
give
his
personal
expressions
of
the
defendant's
guilt,
as
language
as
emphatic
as
this
court
could
write,
is
the
proper
rule;
that
it
is
simply
denial
of
a
fair
trial
for
the
prosecutor
to
make
himself
a
witness
and
to
say
that...
it
suggests
that
there
are
things
he
knows
outside
the
record
that
have
not
come
forward
at
trial,
or
else
we
would
not
bring
this
case.
mr.
burck
bailey
your
honor,
that's
just...
with
all
due
respect,
that's
just
totally
improper
and--
mr.
burck
bailey
--for
the
prosecutor
to
do
as
you
say.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
i
think
i
see
what
you
mean.
you're
saying
based
on
the
evidence,
i
say
that
in
my
opinion
he's
totally
guilty.
mr.
burck
bailey
it
still
makes
the
prosecutor
a
witness.
it
has
no
place
in
a
trial.
drinker
goes
on
to
say
if
expression
of
personal
belief
were
permitted,
it
would
give
an
improper
advantage
to
the
better-known
lawyer
whose
opinion
carries
more
weight,
an
undue
advantage
to
an
unscrupulous
lawyer
if
such
were
permitted.
it
would
be
something...
let's
see...
it
might
be
taken
as
admission
that
he
lacked
faith
in
his
own
case.
it
would
turn
it
into
not
a
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
think
that's...
i
think
that's
too
strong,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
i
suggested
that
they
didn't
intend--
mr.
burck
bailey
--that
billy
young
intended
to
defraud,
based
on
the
evidence
developed
at
trial;
no
suggestion
that
the
case
was
not
brought
in
good
faith,
but
what
had
occurred
in
the
courthouse
at
trial.
mr.
burck
bailey
yes.
mr.
burck
bailey
my
recollection
is,
your
honor,
that
both
i
and
the
other
side
had
a
conflict,
and
i
don't
recall
who
said
that
we
would
like
to
move
it
to
another
docket,
and
the
court
said
well,
it
will
just
be
submitted.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
complete
it.
