interruption
of
closing
argument,
though,
is
something
that
often
doesn't
sit
well
with
a
jury.
i
think
lawyers
are
generally
much
less
willing
to
interrupt
closing
argument
than
to
make
objections
during
the
presentation
of
evidence.
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
factor
that
could
be
taken
into
consideration
by
whichever
side
feels
it's
aggrieved
by
the
argument
of
the
other
side.
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
"fair"
and
"permitted",
we're
talking
basically
about
what,
the
supervisory
rules
for
federal
courts?
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
a
perfectly
permissible
inference
for
a
prosecutor
in
a
fraud
case
to
say
that
people
are
victims
of
fraud?
i
mean
certainly
some
latitude
is
allowed
in
closing
argument.
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
in
order
for
a
prosecutor
in
a
closing
argument
in
a
fraud
case
to
refer
to
the
public
as
a
victim,
you
would
have
to
put
someone
on
the
witness
stand
and
say,
yes,
the
public
is
a
victim
of
this
fraud
that
we
allege?
justice
rehnquist
so
then
what
did
you
do
about
all
this?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
reason
that
it
is
said...
and
i
know
it's
said
by
other
people...
that
a
prosecutor's
expression
of
his
personal
opinion
of
guilt
is
improper?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
they're
not
immediately
at
hand,
perhaps
you
could
come
up
with
it
later
in
your
argument.
justice
rehnquist
does
that
make
any
sense
to
you?
certainly
a
defendant...
a
defense
lawyer
can
express
his
view
that
his
client
is
not
guilty;
why
shouldn't
a
prosecutor
be
able
to
say
he
thinks
the
defendant
is
guilty?
justice
rehnquist
why?
justice
rehnquist
but
when
the
defense
lawyer
expresses
his
view
that
his
client
is
not
guilty,
then
it
must
make
the
defense
lawyer
a
witness.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
would
have
hurt
him
with
the
jury
or
helped
him
in
oklahoma
city?
[laughter]
justice
rehnquist
now,
you
said
a
moment
ago.
mr.
bailey,
that...
as
i
understood
you...
that
the
reason
you
didn't
ask
for
a
curative
instruction
at
the
close
of
all
the
argument
was
that
you
were
afraid
of
losing
the
argument
on
appeal?
justice
rehnquist
don't
you
think
that
the
appellate
court
would
be
perfectly
capable
of
perceiving
that
the
jury
proceedings
had
been
fatally
infected
beyond
the
point
of
curative
instruction
if,
in
fact,
that
was
the
case?
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
isn't
necessarily
the
case,
because
it
depends
on
how
the
question
or
statement
were...
if
i
say...
i'm
the
prosecutor
and
i
say,
"i
am
satisfied
myself
that
the
facts
adduced
before
you,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
show
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
"
now,
there
is
certainly
no
implication
there
that
i
am
relying
on
facts
outside
the
record.
justice
rehnquist
what's
totally
improper?
justice
rehnquist
but
it
must
be
improper
for
some
other
reason
than
indicating
that
there's
a
lot
of
evidence
outside
the
record
that
would
support
it,
because
the
prosecutor
is
expressly
negative,
that
inference,
in
his
statement.
justice
rehnquist
yes.
