mr.
michael
mc
connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
respondent's
conviction
for
mail
fraud
and
false
statements
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
prosecutor
in
his
rebuttal
argument
to
the
jury
expressed
his
personal
opinion
that
respondent
had
committed
fraud.
ordinarily,
such
a
holding
would
be
unremarkable,
one
that
this
court
would
not
be
called
upon
to
review.
however,
there
are
three
aspects
of
the
case
that
do
make
the
holding
remarkable;
indeed,
that
make
the
holding
directly
contrary
to
precedents
by
this
court.
first,
the
error,
if
it
was
error,
was
not
noticed
by
trial
court
or
counsel
when
it
occurred.
it
was
not
preserved
for
appeal
by
an
objection,
and
the
trial
court
was
not
asked
to
take
any
curative
action.
indeed,
the
first
time
that
respondent
mentioned
this
alleged
error
was
in
his
papers
before
the
court
of
appeals.
second,
the
issue
of
the
prosecutor's
personal
opinion
on
respondent's
guilt
was
not
interjected
into
the
trial
by
the
prosecutor
but,
rather,
by
defense
counsel
who
opened
the
issue
during
the
course
of
his
argument
that
the
prosecution
had
been
unfair
and
his
argument
that
the
prosecutor
did
not,
in
fact,
believe
his
own
case
against
the
respondent.
and,
third,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
without
any
inquiry
into
whether
the
respondent's
rights
to
a
fair
trial
were
substantially
prejudiced
by
the
prosecutor's
comments.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
there
was
oral
argument.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
no,
your
honor.
that
appears
not
to
be
the
rule.
the
rule
does
appear
to
be
that
if
the
defense
counsel
goes
out
of
bounds,
the
prosecutor
must
object
but
may
not
pursue
that
line
of
inquiry;
but
that
if
the
prosecutor
goes
out
of
bounds
and
there's
no
objection
by
the
defense
counsel,
apparently
the
practice
in
the
tenth
circuit,
as
in
this
case,
is
that
that
has
no
bearing
or
very
little
bearing
upon
whether
the
court
of
appeals
will
take
that
issue
upon
on
appeal.
which
we
would
suggest,
incidentally,
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
correct
rule,
because
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement
is
itself
a
rule
of
appellate
procedure.
it
isn't
a
rule
which
is
designed
to
govern
trial
practice
when
one
side
opens
a
line
of
argument,
whether
the
other
side
can
pursue
that
line
of
argument
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
that
isn't
what
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement
is
all
about.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
your
honor,
i
do
think
that
that's
a
sensible
rule,
and
i
believe
that
it
may
often
be
the
appropriate
course
for
the
prosecutor
to
take,
to
object
rather
than
to
pursue
a
fair
response.
but
let
me
point
out
just
a
few
factors
that
make
that--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--your
honor,
i
agree
that
for
the
prosecutor
to
have
lodged
an
objection
was
an
appropriate
course.
but
let
me
just
point
out
several--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--there
are
several
reasons
why
it
may
not
be.
and
the
most
important
is
that
there
is
a
tendency,
a
tradition
if
you
will,
of
giving
very
wide
latitude
to
defense
counsel
in
the
course
of
a
closing
argument.
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
this
is
that
when
defense
counsel
is
pursuing
a
line
of
argument,
the
prosecutor
can't
always
tell
where
it
may
lead.
and
if
the
prosecutor
cuts
off
a
line
of
argument
that
might
later
have
proved
to
have
been
a
permissible
line,
he
may
have
created
a
reversible
error
where
none
would
have
existed
before.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
our
position
is,
in
fact,
that
the
defense
argument
was
improper.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
there
is
a
duty--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--your
honor,
the
question
here
is
whether
the
respondent
was
denied
a
fair
trial.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
i
would
agree
that
under
many
circumstances,
that
that
would
be
the
preferred
course.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
but
there
are
problems
with--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
remember
that
as
the
defense
argument
goes
on,
there
isn't...
it
builds
upon
itself.
and
in
this
case,
the
defense
counsel
began
by
commenting
upon
the
unfairness
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
i
think
we
can
agree
to
that.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that.
so
far
as
i
know,
that's
not--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--that's
right,
but
there
is--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--yes,
your
honor.
but
there
is
a
sense
in
which
allowing
defense
counsel
wider
latitude
that
would
be
allowed
the
prosecutor
is
a
sensible
way
for
the
trial
court
to
operate,
because,
as
i
said,
you
can't
always
tell
where
a
line
of
argument
is
going.
and
it
is
preferred
to
allow
the
defense
counsel
as
much
leeway
as
possible,
and
then
afterwards
if
it's
necessary
to
take
some
corrective
steps.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
no,
your
honor,
but
it
may
very
well
authorize--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
doing
wrong.
it
is
a
matter
of
simply
correcting
a
factual
misstatement
by
defense
counsel.
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--your
honor,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
many
defendants
would,
in
fact,
prefer
to
have
the
prosecutor
discussing
the
integrity
of
the
prosecution,
rather
than
having
the
trial
court--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
your
honor,
two
points.
first
of
all,
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement
is
a
requirement
that
has
to
do
with
appellate
procedure.
when
one
side,
during
the
course
of
a
trial,
introduces
the
line
of
argument,
it
is
not
ordinarily
required
that
the
other
side
launch
an
objection
before
pursuing
the
same
line
of
argument.
he
simply
pursues
that
line
of
argument.
it
may
have
been
irrelevant.
it
may
have
been
prejudicial
in
some
sense,
but
the
other
side
pursues
that
line
of
argument.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
on
the
point
that
there
was
no
error
here
whatsoever.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
but
had
there
been
an
error,
if
iawn
v.
united
states--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
mc
connell
yes,
your
honor.
this
case
has
several
layers
of
problems
with
it.
first
of
all,
we
contend
that
there
was
no
error
at
all,
but
secondly,
that
even
if
there
was
error,
it
certainly
was
not
plain
error
such
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
reverse
without
there
having
been
an
objection.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our
position.
we
believe
that
it
does
not
deny
respondent
a
fair
trial
when
the
prosecutor
takes
the
one
course
rather
than
the
other.
now,
in
any
given
situation,
it
might
be
that
in
some
cases
it
would
be
better
practice
for
the
prosecutor
to
object
rather
than
to
respond.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
there
may
be
a
problem
with
interjecting
the
trial
court
into
the
question
of
the
prosecutor's
good
faith.
there
is
a
factual
allegation
of
hypocrisy
that
was
made
here.
the
trial
court
itself
is
not
in
the
best
position
to
evaluate
whether
that
is
either
true
or
false.
and
if
the
trial
court--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--yes,
your
honor.
but
the
trial
court
may
not
be
in
a
position
to
instruct
the
jury
that,
in
fact,
there's
been
a
factual
allegation
that
was
untrue.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
that
is
why
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
reversing
this
conviction
here
when
the
trail
court
had
not
been
given
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
whether
the
prosecutor's
closing
arguments
were
in
error.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
mr.
chief
justice,
before
lunch,
you
asked
whether
this
was
a
case
in
which
oral
argument
was
dispensed
with
before
the
tenth
circuit.
it
was,
in
fact,
and
so
states
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
opinion.
i
wanted
to
return
to
the
issue
that
we
were
discussing
before
lunch
and
the
question
specifically
whether
the
doctrine
of
invited
response
is
not
one
that
encourages
the
prosecutor
to
fail
to
make
an
objection
when
he
ought
to.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
are
not
arguing
the
equivalent
of
two
wrongs
make
a
right
here
in
this
case
but,
rather,
that
when
examining
the
prosecutor's
comments
to
see
whether
they
constituted
error
at
all,
they
have
to
be
examined
in
context.
and
in
the
context
of
the
defense
provocations
the
prosecutor's
comments
were
not
error,
they
did
not
prejudice
the
accused,
they
did
not
have
any
detrimental
effect
on
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
in
that
particular
context.
ordinarily,
there
are
two
dangers
involved
when
the
prosecutor
expresses
his
personal
opinion
on
a
matter
at
trial.
the
first
is
that
the
jury
may
conclude
from
the
prosecutor's
opinion
that
there
is
evidence
outside
of
the
record
that's
known
to
the
prosecutor,
but
which
was
not
presented
to
the
jury,
which
would
support
a
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence.
thus,
the
jury
may
be
tempted
to
convict
not
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence,
but
rather
on
the
supposition
of
this
extra
record
evidence.
it
would
suggest
that
in
this
context,
after
the
defense
provocation,
that
there
was
no
danger
of
that
whatsoever,
just
as
long
v.
united
states,
the
prosecutor
did
not
say
or
insinuate
that
his
comments
were
based
on
personal
knowledge.
indeed,
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor
were
repeatedly
interlaced
with
comments
on
the
evidence,
and
his
comments
were
truly
opinions
on
the
evidence
and
not
opinions
based
upon
anything
outside.
for
example,
after
reviewing
what
the
various
apco
officials
had
said
to
respondent
and
respondent
had
said
to
them,
the
prosecutor
stated,
"i
don't
know
what
you
call
that.
"
"i
call
it
fraud.
"
"you
can
look
at
the
evidence
and
you
can
remember
the
testimony.
"
"you
remember
what
they
said
and
what
he
admitted
they
said.
"
"i
think
it's
a
fraud.
"
note
the
way
the
prosecutor
continually
refers
the
jury
back
to
the
evidence.
admittedly,
the
prosecutor
is
expressing
his
opinion
because
the
defense
had
raised
the
issue
of
the
prosecutor's
opinion,
but
in
this
instance,
the
response
did
not
infringe
upon
the
right
of
the
accused
to
have
the
jury
decide
the
question
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
it,
because
the
prosecutor's
remarks
in
this
context
did
not
imply
or
suggest
or
insinuate
the
existence
of
extra-record
evidence.
the
second
danger
from
prosecutors
expressing
their
personal
opinions
on
matters
is
that,
as
the
representative
of
the
government,
they
may
over-awe
the
jury
with
the
power
or
prestige
of
the
government.
thus,
it
may
tempt
the
jury
to
convict
not
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
it,
but
rather
out
of
a
respect
for
the
position
of
the
government
in
the
case.
this
danger
is
also
remote
in
the
context
that
we're
talking
about,
that
is
to
say,
in
a
fair
response
context
where
the
defense
has
challenged
the
integrity
of
the
prosecution.
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
did
not
invoke
the
power
and
prestige
of
the
government.
he
did
not
make
any
of
the
types
of
arguments
that
one
sometimes
sees
quoted,
particularly
in
older
decisions
in
which
the
jury
was
being
exhorted
to
follow
the
lead
of
the
government.
indeed,
the
prosecutor
specifically
labeled
the
opinion
that
he
gave
as
his
personal
impressions,
since
it
was
asked
of
me.
thus,
the
jury
was
informed
by
the
prosecutor
that
he
was
just
giving
his
personal
opinion
because
it
was
asked
of
him
by
the
defense
counsel.
and
indeed,
there
is
something
a
little
peculiar
about
the
thought
that
the
jury
in
this
case
might
have
been
over-awed
by
the
power
and
prestige
of
the
government
because,
after
all,
it
was
the
defense
that
had
introduced
this
notion
that
the
prosecution
had
been
behaving
unfairly
and
that
it
had
been
reprehensible,
and
that
the
prosecution
did
not
even
believe
its
own
case.
when
the
prosecutor
responded
by
saying,
"yes,
we
do
believe
in
our
own
case.
"
that
did
nothing
more
than
cancel
out
the
defense
counsel's
remarks,
thus
refocusing
the
jury's
attention
where
it
belonged,
namely,
on
the
evidence,
instead
of
upon
the
baseless
accusations
by
defense
counsel.
thus,
in
this
case,
just
as
in
long
v.
united
states,
where
the
court...
and
the
court's
words
there:
"defense
counsel's
own
comments
clearly
invited
the
reply
which
he
now
attacks.
"
now,
again,
the
question
for
the
court
today
is
whether
this
type
of
response
constitutes
reversible
error,
whether
there
was
prejudice
to
the
defendant,
and
whether
the
defendant
was
denied
a
fair
trial
as
a
result
of
this.
it
is
certainly
relevant
to
that
analysis
of
the
prosecutor's
comments
that
defense
counsel
himself
had
introduced
this
line
of
argument,
that
he
had
opened
the
door
to
the
discussion
of
the
prosecutor's
views.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
your
honor,
i
would
not
think
that
that
particular
instance
would
constitute
an
invitation.
but
to
try
to
answer
your
question
more
fully,
i
do
believe
that
there
can
be
invitations
which
would
lead
to
something
that
would
constitute
a
comment
on
the
failure
to
take
a
stand.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
i
can
imagine
responses
that
would
constitute
plain
error.
your
honor,
we
are
not
contending
that
whenever
the
defense
does
anything
that
is
all
improper,
that
that
means
that
the
prosecution
has
a
blank
check
to
make
whatever
response
it
cares
to.
our
position
is
simply
that
where,
as
here,
the
response
is
directly
related
to
the
provocation
and
is
proportionate
to
it,
that
it
is
a
fair
response.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
yes,
your
honor;
although
in
the
extreme,
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
a
due
process
component
as
well,
but
we
are
talking
here
about
the
federal
court
system.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
permissible
for
that
to
be
taken
into
account.
when
the
court
is
considering
whether
an
error
is
plain,
there
are
two
determinations
that
should
be
made.
the
first
is
that
the
error
was
plain
in
the
sense
of
its
being
obvious
or
clear,
and
the
fact
that
the
court
has
spoken
to
that
precise
issue
on
other
occasions
would
certainly
contribute
to
that
portion
of
the
finding.
but
there's
a
second
determination
that
needs
to
be
made
as
well,
which
is
that
the
error,
as
well
as
being
obvious,
was
an
error
of
substantial
prejudice
to
the
accused.
in
this
instance,
we
would
submit
that
the
error
failed
under
both
of
those
considerations
since
we
do
not
consider
it
plain
in
the
sense
of
being
obvious.
we
believe,
rather,
that
it
was
quite
permissible
under
the
precedents
of
this
court.
and
in
any
event,
it
is
not
plain
in
the
sense
of
prejudicing
the
substantial
rights
of
the
accused.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
that's
our
position
as
well.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
that's
right,
your--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
it
is
not
error
at
all,
and
it
falls
a
fortiori
that
it
was
not
plain
error.
in
this
instance,
because
the
defendant
failed
to
make
an
objection
at
the
time
of
trial,
the
trial
court,
who
was
able
to
see
the
gestures,
tone,
emphasis,
and
so
forth
of
the
argument,
was
not
able
to--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--in
which
case,
one
would
expect
that
the
conclusion
would
be
that
the
conviction
would
stand
because
there's
no--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--there
is
a
requirement
in
appellate
procedure
of
preserving
the
error
for
appeal.
there
is
no
requirement
in
trial
practice
that
an
objective
proceed
pursuing
a
line
of
argument,
even
where
that
line
of
argument
might
have
been
improper
on
the
part
of
those
that
initiated
it.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
that
certainly
is
the
usual
rule,
your
honor.
where
the
defense
has
charged
the
prosecutor
with
hypocrisy
in
bringing
the
charges,
however,
the
prosecutor
is
certainly
within
his
rights
in
informing
the
jury
that
that
is
certainly...
that
that
is
not
the
case;
that
they
have
been
misled
by
defense
counsel.
just
as
in
long
v.
united
states,
this
court
held
that
the
prosecutor
was
entitled
to
express
his
view
on
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
before
the
court
because
of
the
fact
the
defense
counsel
made
an
improper
attack
upon
that
issue
of
credibility.
when
the
defense
chooses
to
open
a
line
of
argument,
it
is
to
be
expected
that
the
prosecution
is
going
to
follow
it.
this
is
a
very
different
principle
than
the
principle,
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement,
which
has
to
do
with
the
relationship
between
appellate
courts
and
trial
courts.
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement
is
needed
in
order
to
narrow
the
issues
for
the
appeal,
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
trial
court,
which
is
in
the
best
position
to
judge
this
kind
of
error,
gets
a
first
crack
at
it,
and
in
order
to
make
sure
that
an
error
that
can
be
cured
is--
mr.
michael
mc
connell
--well,
yes,
your
honor.
the
appellate
court,
when
considering
a
possibility
of
an
error,
has
the
benefit
of
the
trial
court's
ruling.
in
this
case,
for
example,
neither
the
defense
counsel
nor
the
trial
court
apparently
saw
anything
amiss
in
the
prosecutor's
argument.
had
there
been
an
objection,
we
would
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
trial
court's
view.
the
trial
court
that
had
seen
the
prosecutor's
argument
could
have
ruled
either
yes,
this
was,
in
context,
a
fair
response
given
the
gestures
and
the
context
and
the
tone
and
the
emphasis;
or
no,
it
was
not.
but
in
the
absence
of
an
objection,
there
was
no
such
ruling,
and
thus
the
appellate
court
was
denied
the
benefit
of
that.
just
to
summarize...
and
i
see
that
my
time
is
growing
short...
it
is
our
position
that
the
prosecutor's
comments
in
this
case
were
not
error.
and
that
is
because
once
the
defense
had
opened
the
door
to
the
line
of
argument
concerning
the
prosecutor's
integrity
in
bringing
the
prosecution,
the
prosecutor
was
within
his
rights
in
making
a
moderate,
perfectly
direct,
not
disproportionate
response
to
that.
we
do
not
believe
that
in
anyway
that
that
interfered
with
the
respondent's
right
to
a
fair
trial.
but,
in
addition
to
that,
the
failure
of
respondent
to
lodge
an
objection
required
a
still
more
exacting
review
of
the
nature
of
the
error
and
the
nature
of
the
prejudice
which
the
court
did
not
engage
in.
and
then,
finally,
since
the
court
failed
to
consider
the
issue
of
prejudice,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
their
burden
to
ensure
that
they're
not
reversing
on
the
basis
of
harmless
error,
they
should
have
done
so.
having
not
done
so
they
reversed,
we
contend,
needlessly
on
the
basis
of
an
error
that
was,
in
fact,
invited
by
the
defense
and
not
noticed
by
defense
at
trial.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
serious
and
needless
drain
upon
the
resources
available
within
the
criminal
justice
system.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
mc
connell
i'd
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions.
if
not--
