justice
white
i
thought
one
of
your
positions
anyway
was
that
when
the
defense
counsel
opens
the
door,
the
government
is
entitled
to
respond.
justice
white
well,
an
objection
wouldn't
have
done
defense
counsel
any
good.
at
that
point,
you
were
already
entitled
to
respond.
you
say
in
your
papers,
as
i
understand
it,
that
all
of
the
other
circuits
have
held
that
there
is
a
right
to
respond.
justice
white
right.
exactly.
justice
white
aren't
you
going
to
argue
that
there
was
no
error
at
all?
justice
white
aren't
you
going
to
argue
that
there
was
no
error
at
all?
justice
white
but
you
also
said,
"i
submit
to
you,
this
case
has
been
presented
unfairly
by
the
prosecution.
"
justice
white
and
you
said
your
client
was
the
only
one
in
this
whole
affair
who
has
acted
with
honor
and
integrity.
justice
white
do
you
think...
he
talked
about
the
evidence,
and
then
he
says,
"i
don't
know
what
you
call
that;
i
call
it
fraud.
"
now,
is
that
an
erroneous
comment?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
was
your
objection
that
he
just
misstated
the
evidence?
justice
white
but
you
didn't
think
you
were
making
an
error
or
making
any
kind
of
an
improper
statement.
justice
white
and
perhaps
the
prosecutor
didn't
think
you
were
doing
anything
improper.
he
just
wanted
to
respond
to
it.
justice
white
you
think
it's
perfectly
all
right
though,
to
change
the
words
a
little
and
say,
"ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
the
evidence
in
this
case
clearly
shows
that
my
client
is
not
guilty.
"
justice
white
how
do
you
make
a
factual
argument
and
suggest
that
the
facts
refute
the
guilt?
justice
white
in
my
example,
he
didn't
say
what
his
personal
beliefs
were.
he
just
says,
"the
evidence
in
this
case
should
raise
a
reasonable
doubt
in
your
mind.
"
justice
white
"the
evidence
in
this
case
clearly
shows
that
my
client
is
not
guilty.
"
justice
white
well,
the
prosecutor
should
say,
"i
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
clearly
shows
that
the
defendant
is
guilty.
"
justice
white
well,
that's
your
personal
opinion,
isn't
it?
i
just
asked
you,
did
you
say,
"in
my
view,
the
evidence
doesn't
show
guilt.
"
i
take
it
that's
all
right.
you
just
said
that.
