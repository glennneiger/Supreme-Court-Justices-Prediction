justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
requirement
that
requires
that
the
matters
be
withheld
from
the
public
in
such
a
tanner
as
to
leave
no
discretion
on
the
issue?
don't
your
opponents
contend
that
it
doesn't
meet
that
test?
justice
rehnquist
a
and
b
are
disjunctive.
justice
rehnquist
well,
your
position
is
a
source
is
a
source
is
a
source,
and
if
the
thing
was
in
fact
a
source,
we
don't
need
any
four-part
test
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
source
gave
information.
justice
rehnquist
where
is
that
exact
language
found,
mr.
levy,
in
the
statute,
protecting...
is
it
403
(d)(3)?
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
justice
rehnquist
could
it
classify
it
under
3b?
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
say
that
a
court
should
review
in
answering
the
question
about
whether
the
director
has
acted
to
protect
intelligence
sources?
would
you
say
you
review
was
the
action
of
the
director
reasonable?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
what
is
wrong
with
the
government's
definition?
it
is
a
question
of
fact.
if
the
person
gave
information
to
the
cia,
he
was
an
intelligence
source.
justice
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
that
other
than
from
the
statement
of
the
chief
justice?
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
is
this
established
dictionary
definition?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
settle
for
what
you
have
just
defined
now.
it
said
that
in
some
circumstances,
even
where
assurances
of
confidentiality
were
given,
that
person
was
nonetheless
not
an
intelligence
source.
do
you
support
that
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion?
justice
rehnquist
those
are
all
questions
that
are
reviewable
by
a
court.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but...
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
assurance,
that
is
reviewable
by
a
court.
justice
rehnquist
if
that
is
what
congress
intended.
