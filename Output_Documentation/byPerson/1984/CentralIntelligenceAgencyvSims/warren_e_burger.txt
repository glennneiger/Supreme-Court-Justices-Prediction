mr.
williard,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
is
there
a
difference,
in
your
view,
between
intelligence
and
information?
chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
think
it
would
be?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
can
understand
it
better
if
you
said
that
all
information
is
not
intelligence,
but
all
intelligence
is
information.
chief
justice
burger
it
is
merely
a
special
kind
of
information,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
what
does
that...
you
categorize
that
as
intelligence?
chief
justice
burger
overt
activities
of
some
kind?
chief
justice
burger
but
you
do
agree
that
information
is
the
broader
term
of...
intelligence
in
the
sense
of
securing
information,
really
makes
the
two
of
them
synonymous
up
to
that
point,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
levy?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
it
would
not
be
available,
then,
or
it
would
be
available,
which?
how
would
you
categorize
that?
chief
justice
burger
and
what's
your
view?
chief
justice
burger
suppose
there
we
re
a
very
secret
meeting
held
in
the
white
house...
and
if
for
my
hypothetical
we
will
put
ourselves
back
some
years...
and
at
that
meeting
it
is
rumored
that
einstein,
who
is
no
longer
living,
was
present,
and
that
werner
von
braun
was
present,
and
five
or
six,
all
of
the
people
involved
in
the
development
of
the
hydrogen
bomb,
and
that
this
meeting
lasted
for
a
full
day
and
then
a
half
a
day,
and
somehow
or
another
the
information
comes
out
that
leads
someone
to
ask
for
the
minutes
of
that
meeting
and
the
names
of
the
persons
present.
would
you
think
that
even
the
identification
of
the
names
of
the
persons
present
would
give
no
information
to
our
adversaries
that
was
important
to
the
national
security?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
should
think
that
if
you
had
albert
einstein
and
werner
von
braun,
that
you
wouldn't
have
much
of
an
argument
over
that,
would
you?
chief
justice
burger
they
don't...
they
don't
call
einstein
and
werner
von
braun
when
they
talk
about
the
tax
code,
do
they?
chief
justice
burger
maybe
a
new,
special
kind
of
a
bomb
or
whatever.
chief
justice
burger
i
just
want
your
view
on
whether
anyone
can
walk
into
the
cia
and
say
we
want
that
information
about
that
meeting.
chief
justice
burger
your
position
is,
i
take
it,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
protect
the
identity
of
those
people
to
whom
inquiries
are
being
made?
chief
justice
burger
you
are
saying
that
they
have
no
interest,
but
they
are
asserting
one,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
burger
now
let
me
take
you
back
to
my
hypothetical.
suppose
we
substitute
for
these
nameless
people
albert
einstein,
werner
von
braun,
and
a
whole
array
of
specialists
in
these
fields.
you
say
that
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
protect
the
identity
of
those
people
when
it
would
be
clear
to
almost
any
other
country
that
if
we
were
talking
to
these
people,
there
must
be
something
like
the
atom
bomb
or
the
hydrogen
bomb,
or
a
refinement
of
it,
in
the
works.
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
are
you
saying
they
have
just
gone
it
the
wrong
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
d
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
willard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
