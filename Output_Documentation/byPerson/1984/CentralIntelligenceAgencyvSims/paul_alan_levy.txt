mr.
paul
alan
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
in
which
the
respondents
seek
the
disclosure
of
declassified
records
concerning
a
series
of
research
projects
conducted
by
american
scientists
between
1952
and
1966
addressed
to
a
variety
of
topics
principally
related
to
drugs
and
behavioral
modification,
and
the
only
issue
is
whether
these
researchers
were
intelligence
sources.
the
cia
invokes
exemption
3,
which
was
amended
in
1976
to
overrule
this
court's
decision
in
robertson
and
allow
withholding
only
of
matters
which
are
specifically
exempted
pursuant
to
certain
kinds
of
statutes.
and
we
do
agree
that
cia's
claim...
we
do
not
say
the
cia
is
making
a
claim
under
exemption
3a,
but
rather
under
exemption
3b,
and
particularly,
the
prong
of
3b
which
allows
withholding
pursuant
to
statutes
which
refer
to
particular
types
of
matters
to
be
withheld.
there
is
another
exemption
which
is
important
to
this
case,
and
that
is
the
national
security
exemption,
exemption
1,
permitting
the
withholding
of
classified
information.
exemption
1
is
important
for
two
reasons:
first,
because
it
would
prevent
the
occurrence
of
the
parade
of
horribles
the
cia
has
said
would
result
from
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below.
exemption
1
is
not
applicable
here
because
the
cia
has
not
invoked
it
and
in
fact
declassified
the
records,
including
the
names
contained
in
the
records--
the
second
reason
it
is
important
is
because--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--exemption
1
could
protect
open
sources
if
disclosure
of
those
open
sources
would
show
the
cia's
interest
in
the
particular
subject,
would
lead...
would
show
that
the
cia
is
using
that
particular
open
source
and
therefore
cause
the
people
who
put
information
into
that
open
source
to
withhold
the
information
that
the
cia
really
wants.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
and
on
that
basis,
the
cia
could
make
a
claim
under
the
relevant
executive
order
that
disclosure
of
the
source
would
lead
to
damage
to
the
national
security
and
could
therefore
classify
the
name.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i
will
try
to
reach
that
point.
i
will
reach
that
point.
the
second
reason
exemption
1
is
important
is
because
congress
determined,
and
it
was
an
issue
important
enough
to
override
president
ford's
veto
in
this
regard,
that
even
when
the
most
sensitive
national
security
information
is
involved,
the
courts
must
review
the
agency's
determination
de
novo.
the
statute
invoked
by
the
cia
as
a
3b
statute
is
one
part
of
one
provision
of
the
national
security
act
codified
as
selction
403(d)(3).
that
provision,
in
the
process
of
allocating
responsibilities
for
the
various
national
security
tasks
among
the
various
national
security
and
defense
agencies,
gave
the
director
of
central
intelligence
the
responsibility,
and
i
am
quoting,
"for
protecting
intelligence
sources
and
methods
from
unauthorized
disclosure.
"
and
yet,
the
construction
the
cia
would
put
on
that
statute
is
that
any
person--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--it
is
403(d)(3).
it
is
at
the
very
end
of
403(d)(3).
it
is
the
third
3.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
the
construction
the
cia
would
put
on
that
statute
is
that
any
person
who
supplies
the
cia
with
any
information
that
is
useful
to
its
task,
whether
or
not
that
information
is
intelligence,
is
an
intelligence
source.
thus,
as
the
cia
itself
concedes,
the
new
york
times
and
pravda
would
be
intelligence
sources
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
transcript
of
today's
argument,
if
the
cia
desired
to
read
the
transcript
in
the
furtherance
of
its
intelligence
function,
the
reporter
who
prepared
the
transcript
would
be
an
intelligence
source
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
this
is
clearly
not
the
kind
of
intelligence
source
that
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
the
cia,
under
the
cia's
construction
of
the
statute,
the
reporter
would
be
an
intelligence
source--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--and
therefore
exempt
from
disclosure.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
our
view
is
congress
could
not
have
had
the
reporter
who
prepares
the
transcript
or
indeed
these
researchers
in
mind
when
it
used
the
term
"intelligence
source".
mr.
paul
alan
levy
it
would
give
information
damaging
to
the
national
security
and
therefore
could
be
classified.
but
the
question
is
whether
the
persons
present
were
intelligence
sources.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
congress,
when
it
used
intelligence
source,
had
the
intelligence
portion--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--they
are
talking
about
national
security
information,
and
it--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--they
might...
it
depends...
i
guess
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
court's
hypothetical.
is
the
court
asking
whether
einstein
is
an
intelligence
source,
or
is
the
court
asking
whether
somebody
who
reports
the--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--no,
they
certainly
cannot
walk
in
and
ask
for
the
information
because
that
information
would
certainly
be
classified
because
release
of
the
information
would
certainly
cause
damage
to
the
national
security,
and
the
cia
would
be
entitled
to
classify
it.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
but
the
question
is
are
these
people
who
are
discussing
a
method
of
warfare
intelligence
sources
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
exemption
3b
does
not
have
to
bear
the
full
burden
of
protecting
all
of
the
national
security
interests
of
the
united
states
or
all
of
the
national
security
interests
of
the
cia,
for
that
matter.
there
are
other
portions
of
the
national
security
scheme
available
for
that
purpose.
the
cia...
there
is
no
question
that
names
like
that
need
to
be
concealed
but
there
are
other
ways
to
conceal
those
names,
and
yet
the
cia
asks
for
an
all-embracing
definition,
admitting
full
well
that
they
don't
intend
to
withhold
all
of
those
names,
and
that
there
is
no
reason
to
withhold
all
of
the
people
who
would
be
called
intelligence
sources
under
their
construction
of
the
statute.
rather,
they
say
they
have
an
absolute
and
unreviewable
discretion
to
decide
whether
any
of
this
vast
category
of
intelligence
sources
can
be
disclosed,
and
ask
the
court
to
rely
on
their
reasonable
exercise
of
this
discretion
within
the
overbroad
definition.
but
this
approach
of
adopting
the
broadest
possible
construction
of
the
statute,
coupled
with
total
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
agency
to
decide
whether
disclosure
in
any
particular
instance
would
be
consistent
with
the
reasons
for
secrecy,
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
foia
and
of
the
1974
and
1976
amendments
which
require
disclosure
of
records
unless
congress
has
made
a
basic
policy
decision
that
matters
of
this
kind
could
or
should
be
withheld,
and
the
act
requires
courts
to
review
the
agency
withholding
decision,
construing
the
exemptions
narrowly,
and
the
mere
fact
that
an
exemption
has
held
to
satisfy
exemption
3b
does
not
mean
that
it
must
not
also
be
determined
that
the
matter
is
specifically
exempted
by
that
statute,
and
the
courts
are
still
required
to
apply
the
panoply
of
procedural
protections
provided
by
552(a),
de
novo
review,
burden
on
the
agency
to
justify
its
actions.
by
this
means
the
courts
determine
whether
the
withholding
action
of
the
agency
conforms
to
the
congressional
judgment
that
this
is
one
of
the
sorts
of
matters
to
be
withheld.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
the
question
of
whether
any
particular
person
is
an
intelligence
source
is
to
be
reviewed
de
novo.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
but
when
congress...
congress
did
not
say
source
of
information.
it
said
intelligence
source.
intelligence
is
a
narrower
term
than
information.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
and
the
concession
of
my
opponent,
i
believe.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
well,
i
am
not
adverting
to
any
dictionary.
whenever
congress
spoke
of
intelligence
sources,
they
were
speaking
and
looking
at
the
legislative
history
cited
by
defendants.
they
spoke
of
the
sort
of
persons
who
wouldn't
provide
good
information
absent
confidentiality.
whenever
the
legislative
history
spoke
of
the
need
to
protect
sources,
they
referred
to
the
need
to
provide
confidentiality
in
order
to
get
the
information,
and
the
need
to
provide
an
assurance
to
the
sources,
the
intelligence
sources
it
was
describing
in
order
to
get
them
to
give
information.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
we
do,
although
that
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
not
required
to
decide
this
case
because
in
this
case
the
district
court
found
that
almost
all
of
the
principal
researchers
did
not
get
assurances
of
confidentiality,
and
those
who
did
cot
assurances
of
confidentiality,
according
to
the
district
court's
finding,
we
agree
were
reasonably
given
guarantees
of
confidentiality.
but--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--the
question
of
whether
there
was
an
assurance
of
confidentiality
is
a
question
of
fact
which
can
be
established.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
assurance
is
reviewable
but
subject
to
the
halperin
rule
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
that
is
to
say,
giving
substantial
weight
to
the
expertise
of
the
agency
given
the
kinds
of
considerations
that
go
into
the
determination
of
whether
the
confidentiality
was
required.
now,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
leaving
open
the
possibility
that
there
could
be
an
assurance
of
confidentiality
that
was
not
required.
for
example,
if
in
ordering
the
transcript
of
today's
argument
the
cia
were
to
provide
an
assurance
of
confidentiality
to
the
reporter,
we
won't
tell
anybody
that
we
have
bought
the
transcript
from
you,
now,
that
might
be
so
plainly
unnecessary
a
guarantee
of
confidentiality
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
cia
can
claim
that
it
is
needed
for
its
intelligence
function,
that
person
would
not
be
an
intelligence
source.
but
the
substantial
weight
standard
takes
care
of
most
of
the
problems
that
the
cia
refers
to.
moreover,
to
the
extent
that
the
cia
is
concerned
that
there
is
a
court
looking
over
its
shoulder
and
deciding
whether
or
not
confidentiality
was
required
in
the
particular
instance,
that
is
a
cost
which
is
imposed
by
the
doctrine
of
de
novo
review,
which
is
applied
not
only
to
intelligence
sources,
but
to
the
most
sensitive
of
national
security
information.
the
deployment
of
nuclear
weapons,
whether
that
is
properly
classified
is
a
question
reviewed
de
novo
pursuant
to
exemption
1.
certainly
if
we
can
trust
the
courts
to
do
that,
we
can
trust
the
courts
to
review
subject
to
the
substantial
weight
standard,
the
necessity
of
providing
assurances
of
confidentiality.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
yes,
indeed.
but
since
we
have
the
legislative
history
which
shows
continuous
reference
to
intelligence
sources
in
the
context
of
where
you
wouldn't
get
the
information
or
at
least
wouldn't
get
good
information,
in
the
case
of
an
open
source,
an
open
source
may
well
be
an
intelligence
source
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
if
confidentiality
of
the
cia's
reference
to
that
source
is
needed
to
make
sure
that
it
is
good
information,
for
example,
the
obscure
eastern
european
technical
journal
cited
in
the
cia's
brief.
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
these
researchers,
with
a
very
few
exceptions,
were
such
sources,
that
is
to
say,
that
either
that
they
couldn't
get
good
information
or
that
they
would
refuse
to
be
involved
with
the
cia
and
provide
research
services
to
the
cia
without
a
guarantee
of
confidentiality--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--if
confidentiality,
under
the
court
of
appeals
construction
of
the
statute,
if
confidentiality
is
required
for
the
cia
to
make
effective
use
because
the
information...
either
because
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
the
subscription
because
the
person
who
sends
out
the
journal
would
say,
oh,
the
cia,
no,
they
don't
get
one,
or
because
the
person
who
make
up
the
magazine
know
that
the
cia
is
looking
at
the
magazine
and
therefore
moderate,
control
the
information
that
goes
into
it,
confidentiality
is
then
required
for
the
cia
to
make
use
of
that--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--that
may
well
be
exempt
as
an
intelligence
method.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
the
method
by
which
the
cia
is
conducting--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--if
they
listen
to
a
bar--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--by
the
very
definition
of
the
hypothetical,
it
would
reveal
an
intelligence
method
and
is
therefore
exempt
from--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--if
it
would
reveal
their
area
of
interest,
then
that
would
be
classifiable,
because
revealing
an
area
of
cia
interest
could
cause
damage
to
the
national
security
by
preventing--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--you
classify--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--you
classify
the
fact
that
the
cia
uses
the
want
ads,
assuming
that
it
is
not...
everybody
doesn't
know
that
in
fact
the
cia
looks
at
the
new
york
times
want
ads.
the
argument
about
guaranteeing
confidentiality
and
the
court
of
appeals
requiring
the
breaking
of
the
promise
of
confidentiality
also
assumes
that
the
cia
makes
guarantees
of
confidentiality,
but
the
cia
in
its
very...
in
its
brief
on
the
institutions
questions,
makes
it
clear
that
they
reserve
the
right
on
any
occasion
to
disclose
an
intelligence
source
if
for
any
one
of
a
number
of
reasons
they
believe
that
it
is
appropriate
to
do
so.
thus,
for
example,
here
two-thirds
of
the
institutions
were
disclosed
by
the
cia
despite
their
position,
first,
that
the
institutions
were
intelligence
sources,
and
despite
their
position
that
the
disclosure
of
the
institutions
would
lead
to
the
disclosure
of
the
principal
researchers.
indeed,
the
district
court
found
that
six
of
the
principal
researchers
received
either
implicitly
or
explicit
guarantees
of
confidentiality.
yet
the
cia
disclosed
institutions
at
which
five
of
those
principal
researchers
were
working.
the
cia
also
disclosed
the
principal
researcher
engaged
in
the
most
sensitive
of
the
mkultra
projects
involving
the
administration
of
drugs
to
unwitting
subjects.
so
both
because
the
perception
argument
based
on
the
court
of
appeals
requiring
perhaps
the
breaking
of
an
unnecessary
promise,
and
because
rarely
will
courts
override
a
cia
definition
that
a
guarantee
was
in
fact
necessary,
the
court
of
appeals
we
think
was
right
in
saying
that
you
should
leave
open
the
possibility
that
reviewing
de
novo
subject
to
the
substantial
weight
standard,
you
could
require
the
cia
to
disclose
an
intelligence
source
despite
the
fact
that
the
source
was
provided
an
assurance
of
confidentiality.
now,
the
cia
also
attacks
the
court
of
appeals
decision
because
it
would
require
the
disclosure
of
many
matters
which
are
required,
plainly
required
in
the
national
interest
to
be
kept
secret.
but
the
fundamental
objection
to
that
is
that
the
cia
would
have
403(d)(3)
carry
the
full
burden
of
protecting
national
security
information.
403(d)(3)
is
part
of
a
statutory
scheme,
other
parts
of
which
are
also
devoted
to
protecting
national
security
information,
the
national
security
exemption,
the
intelligence
methods
provision,
403(g)
pertaining
to
cia
employees.
but
the
cia
also
errs
in
treating
the
court
of
appeals
appeals
construction
as
if
it
were
a
statutory
definition
contained
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
formulation
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
inquiries
required
by
the
court
of
appeals
construction
of
the
statute
in
this
case
were
not
intended
to
be
applied
to
most
persons
involved
in
the
kind
of
cia
operations
cited
in
the
cia's
brief,
the
secret
agents,
the
recruiters
of
other
intelligence
sources.
the
court
of
appeals
was
very
clear
in
it
opinion
at
pages
10a
and
11a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
that
these
inquiries
would
not
be
applicable
in
the
run
of
the
mill
intelligence
source
case.
the
reason
for
the
construction
was
that
this
was
a
peripheral
case.
now,
the
district
court
said
we
don't
need
to
make
a
definition
of
an
intelligence
source
because
this
is
so
clearly
beyond
what
congress
had
in
mind.
the
cia
insisted
that
there
must
be
a
definition.
the
court
of
appeals
came
up
with
a
definition.
he
think
it
is
basically
a
workable
definition,
but
the
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
that
that
is
an
appropriate
construction
of
the
statute
in
order
to
affirm
the
result
below.
rather,
because
of
the
unique
facts
of
this
case,
because
these
were
domestic
scientific
researchers
in
a
declassified
program,
no
indication,
with
a
few
exceptions
who
are
to
be
withheld,
that
there
was
any
desire
for
confidentiality,
the
documents
destroying
the
program
were
destroyed,
and
so
the
only
way
we
can
find
out
the
details
of
the
program
are
to
talk
to
the
researchers
and
find
out
what
they
did.
and
finally,
insofar
as
conngress
has
ever
addressed
the
question
of
the
mkultra
researchers
and
the
files...
not
the
researchers,
excuse
me,
but
the
mkultra
files,
it
has
said
that
it
desires
that
mkultra
files
be
available
for
review.
it
cautioned
that
mkultra
files
were
not
to
be
treated
as
operational
files.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
of
these
people,
given
the
unique
character
of
their
research,
the
circumstances
under
which
the
research
was
undertaken,
the
fact
that
the
cia
no
longer
has
any
interest
in
concealing
the
fact
of
its
interest
in
the
mkultra
program
or,
indeed,
the
methods
by
which
the
mkultra--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--they
are
asserting
only
an
interest
in
protecting
the
identities
of
the
researchers.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
they
could
be
protected,
but
not
as
intelligence
sources.
they
could
be
protected
because
they
are
discussing
classified
information,
they
could
be
protected
because
identification
here
by--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--no.
here,
by
contrast,
they
don't
claim
an
interest
in
protecting
the
details
of
the
mkultra
program.
they
say
all
we
care
about
is
the
names
of
the
researchers,
and
we
say
that
the
researchers
are
not
intelligence
sources,
and
unlike
the
einstein
example,
there
is
no
additional
reason
to
prevent
them
from
being
disclosed.
in
the
einstein
example
there
are
clear,
there
are
several
additional
reasons
to
not
disclose
the
information.
i
would
like
to
address
very
briefly
the
question
of
the
institutions
which
was
raised
in
our
cross
petition.
the
cia's
principal
argument
in
that
regard
is
that
disclosure
would
lead
to
the
identification
of
the
principal
researchers
who
were
intelligence
sources.
now,
we
accept
the
argument
in
principle.
assuming
that
they
are
intelligence
sources,
and
assuming
that
disclosure
of
the
institutions
would
lead
to
the
identification
of
the
identification
of
the
researchers,
that
is
enough
reason
to
allow
the
names
of
the
institutions
to
be
withheld.
the
problem
is
in
the
application
of
that
principle
to
the
facts
in
this
case
because
the
cia
never
carried
its
burden
of
showing,
a
burden
which
it
has
under
552(a)(4)(b),
the
burden
of
sustaining
its
action.
although
its
brief
says
over
and
over
that
the
director
of
central
intelligence
has
made
a
judgment
that
disclosure
would
lead
to
the
identification
of
the
principal
researchers,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
director
of
central
intelligence
made
that
judgment,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
director
of
central
intelligence
believes,
or
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
disclosure
of
the
institutions
would
lead
to
the
identification
of
the
principal
researchers.
the
affidavits
never
say
that,
and
all
we
say
is
that
the
cia
is
required
its
burden
of
proof.
moreover,
the
cia
has
identified
two-thirds
of
the
institutions,
including
those
for
five
of
the
six
principal
researchers
who
got
guarantees
of
confidentiality.
there
is
apparently...
they
apparently
did
not
believe
that
identification
of
those
institutions
would
lead
to
the
principal
researchers,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
the
undisclosed
institutions
are
any
different
than
the
disclosed
institutions,
institutions
like
the
national
institutes
of
health,
stanford
university,
large
institutions.
now,
if
the
cia
could
show
or
had
shown
that
the
undisclosed
institutions
were
different,
that
these
were
small
operations
where
simply
by
knowing
the
name
of
the
operation
you
should
figure
out,
or
a
sophisticated
observer
could
figure
out
that
these
are
the
people
who
were
the
principal
researchers,
coupled
with
the
determination
that
the
principal
researchers
are
exempt
from
disclosure,
this
would
be
a
different
case.
but
the
cia
has
not
made
the
demonstration
in
this
case.
if
this
court
has
no
further
questions--
