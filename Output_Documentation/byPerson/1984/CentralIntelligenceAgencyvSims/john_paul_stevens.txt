justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
levy,
would
exemption
1
protect
open
sources?
justice
stevens
i
thought
you
described
it
as
protecting
classified
information.
i
may
be...
i
don't
have
exemption
1
in
front
of
me
right
now,
but
it
is
broader
than
protecting
classified
information.
justice
stevens
i
see,
but
what
about
just
the
plain
language
of
intelligence
source?
why
doesn't
that
cover
open
sources?
i
am
getting
ahead.
you
develop
your
own
argument.
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
troubles
me.
justice
stevens
you
are
going
to
have
to
help
me
a
little
were
on
your...
when
is
an
open
source
within
and
when
is
it
not
within
exemption
3?
justice
stevens
well,
what
if
the
cia
just
doesn't
want
certain
other
parties
to
know
that
this
is
the
area
which
it
examines
to
get
certain
kinds
of
information?
maybe
information
will
continue
to
flow,
but
it
would
disclose
the
direction
of
our
discovery
if
we
had
to--
justice
stevens
--as
an
intelligence
method?
justice
stevens
they
read
the
want
ads
in
the
new
york
times
and
they
get
some
very
valuable
information,
but
they
don't
want
others
to
know
that
is
a
source
of
information,
that
would
just
be
an
open
source,
but
you
would
say
there
is
no
protection
of
that,
i
think.
or
they
listen
to
a
bartender
in
london
who
talks
about
certain
subjects.
justice
stevens
that
would
be
covered
by
your
first
example,
but
say
there
are
certain
sources
they
just
don't
want
outsiders
to
know
that
they
use
those
sources
because
that
would
reveal
something
about
their
methods
of
gathering
intelligence?
justice
stevens
or
their
areas
of
interest,
it
would
reveal
their
areas
of
interest
perhaps.
justice
stevens
i
don't
know
how
you
classify
new
york
times
want
ads.
justice
stevens
and
that's
what
you'd
have
to
do
under
exemption
1,
i
think.
