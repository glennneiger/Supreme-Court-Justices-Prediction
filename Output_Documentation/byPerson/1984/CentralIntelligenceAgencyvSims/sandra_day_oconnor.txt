justice
o'connor
mr.
willard,
if
your
view
is
correct,
do
we
need
still
to
give
some
objective
definition
for
what
is
an
intelligence
source?
do
we
need
to
give
content
to
that
term
at
all?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
the
decision
of
the
director
to
authorize
disclosure
carries
with
it
no
component
of
reasonableness
in
making
the
determination?
justice
o'connor
but
you
don't
want
us
to
attempt
to
give
any
framework
or
description
of
the
content
of
intelligence
source
in
this
particular
case.
