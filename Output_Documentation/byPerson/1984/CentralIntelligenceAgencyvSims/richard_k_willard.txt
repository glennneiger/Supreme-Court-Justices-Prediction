mr.
richard
k.
willard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
scientific
researchers
utilized
by
cia
during
the
1950s
and
'60s
in
project
mkultra
are
intelligence
sources
within
the
meaning
of
section
403(d)(3)
of
the
national
security
act
of
1947,
and
thus
exempt
from
disclosure
under
exemption
3
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
i
am
going
to
argue
today,
first,
that
the
court
of
appeals
incorrectly
interpreted
the
national
security
act,
and
second,
that
nothing
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
supports
or
requires
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
a
two-part
test
for
deciding
if
a
person
or
institution
is
an
intelligence
source
under
section
403(d)(3).
the
first
part
of
the
test
dealt
with
the
relevance
of
the
information
provided
by
the
course
to
cia's
intelligence
function,
and
the
second
part
of
the
test
dealt
with
the
need
for
confidentiality
of
that
source.
the
first
part
of
the
test
is
not
an
issue
here
today.
the
district
court
found
that
cia
could
reasonably
determine
that
this
research,
referring
to
project
mkultra,
was
needed
for
its
intelligence
function,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
and
the
respondents
did
not
seek
this
court's
review
of
that
issue.
the
second
part
of
the
two-part
test
is
the
issue
today.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
an
intelligence
source
must
provide
information
of
a
kind
that
cia
could
not
reasonably
expect
to
obtain
without
guaranteeing
the
confidentiality
of
those
who
provide
it.
it
is
our
position
that
this
second
part
of
the
two-part
test
created
an
unwarranted
and
unreasonable
gloss
on
the
plain
language
of
section
403(d)(3).
the
practical
consequences
of
this
second
part
of
the
test,
especially
as
spelled
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
second
opinion
in
sims,
is
to
exclude
three
categories
of
sources
which
we
believe
congress
clearly
intended
to
be
covered
under
the
1947
act.
the
first
excluded
category
are
open
sources,
periodicals,
radio
broadcasts,
public
speeches,
and
the
1947
act's
legislative
history
shows
congress
was
informed
that
the
bulk
if
not
the
majority
of
our
intelligence
would
be
developed
from
precisely
those
kinds
of
open
sources.
the
second
category
excluded
by
the
court
of
appeals'
definition
are
unwitting
sources,
that
is,
sources
that
don't
know
they
are
providing
information
to
cia
when
they
provide
information
to
someone
they
think
may
be
a
trusted
confidant
or
perhaps
even
a
fellow
conspirator
in
their
activities.
again,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
these
sources
can
be
protected
under
the
court
of
appeals
definition.
since
they
don't
even
know
they
are
being
sources,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
they
can
require
a
pledge
of
confidentiality.
finally,
and
perhaps
most
shockingly,
the
court
of
appeals
definition
excludes
even
sources
who
ask
for
and
receive
an
express
pledge
of
confidentiality
from
cia
if
either
they
are,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
unreasonably
and
atypically
leery
of
cooperating
with
cia,
or
if
they
are
providing
the
type
of
information
that
cia
could
have
obtained
readily
and
openly
from
other
sources.
the
harms
of
this
narrow
definition
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
are
evident.
among
other
things,
revealing
these
kinds
of
sources
will
necessarily
reveal
the
topics
of
interest
to
cia
which
it
is
pursuing,
even
if
it
is
pursuing
those
topics
of
interest
by
trying
to
develop
information
from
open
sources.
more
importantly,
in
many
cases,
the
inability
to
preserve
the
confidentiality
of
sources
will
cause
them
to
dry
up.
as
this
court
recognized
in
its
opinion
in
snepp,
providing
confidentiality
of
intelligence
sources
may
be
vital
to
assuring
their
continued
cooperation.
the
point
of
all
of
this
is
not
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
insufficiently
school
in
the
craft
of
intelligence
to
prepare
the
correct
definition
for
when
confidentiality
of
intelligence
sources
is
necessary.
the
point
is
that
in
the
1947
national
security
act,
congress
assigned
that
responsibility
to
the
director
of
central
intelligence
and
not
to
the
courts.
it
is
difficult
for
courts
to
obtain
evidence
and
make
studied
judgments
as
to
when
sources
should
or
should
not
be
kept
confidential.
courts
can
be
abusive
in
the
way
they
determine
these
issues,
as
was
the
district
court
in
the
fitzgibbon
case
which
we
cite
in
our
briefs,
where
the
court
decided
that
it
could
second
guess
the
judgment
of
the
director
of
central
intelligence
as
to
whether
events
had
sufficiently
changed
in
the
dominican
republic
so
that
sources
there
who
were
once
confidential
would
now
be
proud
to
have
been
associated
with
cia.
in
addition,
even
if
the
courts
make
the
right
determinations
as
to
whether
sources
should
or
should
not
be
kept
confidential,
these
sources
may
not
trust
that
the
courts
will
make
the
right
decision
in
their
cases,
especially
when
the
passage
of
time
may
cause
the
concerns
of
the
intelligence
source
to
be
somewhat
less
appreciable,
much
as
is
the
situation
in
this
case,
where
many
of
the
sources
are
20
or
30
years
old.
in
conclusion,
it
is
our
position
that
section
403(d)(3)
means
what
it
says
when
it
says
that
the
director
of
central
intelligence
shall
be
responsible
for
protecting
intelligence
sources
and
methods
from
unauthorized
disclosure,
and
this
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
second
part
of
the
two-part
test
crafted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
further,
we
believe
that
nothing
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
charges
this
interpretation
of
the
national
security
act.
exemption
3
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
incorporates
by
reference
certain
other
statutes
that
provide
for
withholding
of
particular
kinds
of
information.
once
you
decide
that
exemption
3
applies
to
a
particular
statute,
then
it
is
thew
underlying
statute
and
not
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
determines
whether
or
not
a
particular
kind
of
information
can
be
withheld.
that
was
the
approach
followed
by
this
court
in
its
recent
decisions
in
exemption
3
cases
such
as
baldrige
v.
shapiro
and
consumer
product
savety
commission
v.
gte
sylvania.
that
is
the
approach
we
are
asking
the
court
to
apply
today.
with
regard
to
section
403(d)(3),
congress
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
consistently
regarded
section
403(d)(3)
as
an
exemption
3
statute,
and
that
that
conclusion
has
not
been
changed
by
the
1976
amendments
to
exemption
3.
as
amended,
exemption
3
provides
that
a
statute
is...
provides
exemption
from
disclosure
if
it
refers
to
particular
types
of
matters
to
be
withheld,
and
section
403(d)(3)
certainly
does
that
by
referring
to
particular
types
of
matters,
intelligence
sources
and
methods.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
it
is
not
clear,
justice
rehnquist,
but
if
that
is
their
contention,
it
is
clearly
wrong
because
exemption
3
has
two
subparts,
subpart
a
and
subpart
b.
subpart
a
refers
to
statutes
that
leave
no
discretion
with
regard
to
withholding
information,
and
we
are
not
contending
that
403(d)(3)
falls
under
subsection
a.
subsection
b,
however,
provides
two
alternative
tests
for
qualifying
as
an
exemption
3
statute.
one
is
whether
the
statute
establishes
particular
criteria
for
withholding,
and
we
are
not
claiming
to
fall
under
that.
the
second
half
of
subpart
b,
though,
refers
to
statutes
that
refer
to
particular
types
of
matters
to
be
withheld.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
and
that
conclusion
is
reinforced
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
1976
amendments
which
at
one
point
specifically
refers
to
section
403(d)(3)
as
a
statute
which
is
intended
to
be
covered
under
exemption
3.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
that
is
really
an
issue
presented
in
this
case
because
as
i
stated
at
the
outset,
the
first
part
of
the
two-part
test,
that
is,
whether
the
source
provides
information
that
relates
to
cia's
intelligence
functions,
is
a
part
of
the
test
that
we
met
in
this
case.
the
district
court
found
we
had
met
it
on
the
record,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
and
that
is
not
here.
it
is
our
position,
however,
that
is
the
only
inquiry.
that
is,
once
the
courts
decide
that
a
source
is
an
intelligence
source,
there
is
no
basis
for
going
on
and
adding
additional
steps
to
the
test.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
we
believe
the
determination,
once
it
is
decided
that
a
source
is
an
intelligence
source,
to
disclose
or
not
to
disclose
that
source
is
a
determination
which
was
given
by
congress
in
the
1947
act
to
the
director
of
central
intelligence
and
is
not
a
decision
which
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
what
is
subject
to
judicial
review
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
the
director's
decision
to
classify
someone
as
a
source.
if
the
director
tries
to
claim
that
someone
who
has
not
provided
intelligence-related
information
is
a
source,
that
is
subject
to
review
and
overruling
by
the
courts.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i
don't
believe
that
is
necessary,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
definition,
the
first
part
of
the
two-part
test
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
applied
in
this
case,
properly
in
our
view,
and
held
that
these
sources
were
intelligence
sources.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
exactly
right,
justice
rehnquist.
that
is
our
position,
and
we
believe
the
second
part
of
the
two-part
test
is
totally
illegitimate
because
the
first
part
resolves
whether
or
not
the
source
was
a
source,
and
the
second
part
was
created
out
of
thin
air
and
has
no
support
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
intelligence,
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
security
act,
pertains
to
cia's
functions.
that
is,
cia
is
authorized
to
gather
foreign
intelligence
and
to
engage
in
foreign
intelligence
and
counterintelligence
activities.
it
must
have
a
nexus
to
national
security
and
foreign
affairs.
information
that
does
not
have
some
nexus
to
cia's
statutory
mission
under
the
national
security
act
is
not
intelligence
information.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that
is
correct
in
part,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
addition,
however,
cia's
intelligence
mission
includes
not
only
gathering
information
but
also
engaging
in
operations.
for
example,
in
the
context
of
this
case--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
we
believe
it
can
be
categorized
as
intelligence,
but--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--those
activities
are
intelligence
activities
under
the
national
security
act,
in
our
view.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
especially
where
it
deals
with
cia's
national
security
mission.
my
point
was
that
if
a
source
of
information
has
nothing
to
do
with
cia's
statutory
mission
under
the
national
security
act,
then
it
wouldn't
qualify
as
an
intelligence
source
under
that
act.
but
again,
as
i
said,
that
is
not
really
an
issue
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
dispute
at
this
point
with
regard
to
our
meeting
the
first
part
of
the
two-part
test.
the
question
is
really
was
there
any
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
create
the
second
part
of
the
two-part
test,
and
our
position
is
there
was
not.
this
conclusion
is
reinforced
by
and
not
undermined
by
the
cia
information
act
of
1984
which
was
addressed
in
respondents'
supplemental
brief.
as
we
have
pointed
out,
that
act
was
passed
premised
on
the
understanding
that
much
information
in
cia
was
exempt
from
disclosure
because,
it
was
either
classified
or
because
it
was
intelligence
source
information
under
section
403(d)(3),
and
therefore,
the
legislative
history
of
that
recent
statute
simply
confirms
our
understanding,
and
that
is
that
the
term
intelligence
source
in
section
403(d)(3)
should
be
given
a
broad
meaning,
an
that
all
intelligence
sources
are
subject
to
protection
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court
at
this
time,
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
issue
raised
in
the
cross
petition
which
i
have
not
previously
addressed.
there
is
no
disagreement
on
the
legal
theory
here.
as
mr.
levy
admits,
they
agree
that
if
the
disclosure
of
an
institution
could
lead
to
the
identification
of
a
researcher,
and
if
we
can
withhold
the
researcher's
identity,
then
we
ought
to
be
able
to
withhold
the
information
about
the
institution.
what
he
challenges
is
the
factfinding
of
the
district
court.
he
claims
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
insufficient
to
support
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
court,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
such
a
disclosure
could
be
expected
to
occur.
we
think
that
just
common
sense
establishes
that
the
disclosure
of
institutions
could
establish
the
identity
of
the
researchers,
or
create
a
risk
of
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
let's
keep
in
mind
that
the
district
court
had
before
it
a
very
extensive
record,
including
elaborate
answers
to
interrogatories
providing
detailed
facts
about
each
of
those
mkultra
projects.
all
of
the
documents
were
declassified,
with
only
the
names
of
the
researchers
and
institutions
deleted.
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
not
hard
for
the
jigsaw
puzzle
to
be
completed
if
something
is
turned
over.
a
good
example
of
this
appears
on
page
59
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
a
document
describing
one
of
the
mkultra
research
projects,
subproject
146.
the
name
of
the
institution
and
the
researcher
is
deleted,
but
the
document
says
that
the
researcher
has
recently
retired
from
his
position
as
chief
of
pathology,
and
goes...
of
the
institution,
which
was
deleted,
and
goes
on
to
say
that
he
is
a
world
reknowned
plant
pathologist.
now,
even
at
a
fairly
large
institution
like
stanford
or
harvard
there
may
not
be
very
many
world
reknowned
plant
pathologists.
it
doesn't
require
much
common
sense
to
see
that
the
district
court's
finding
of
fact
here
that
the
disclosure
of
these
institutions
could
identify
the
researchers
can
be
amply
supported
in
the
evidence
in
this
record,
and
if
the
court
reviews
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
about
each
of
these
projects,
i
think
the
court
will
come
to
share
that
conclusion.
in
addition,
the
argument
has
been
raised
about
a
sort
of
estoppel
argument.
since
we
disclosed
two-thirds
of
the
institutions,
why
don't
we
disclose
the
rest
of
them?
that
argument
we
think
has
no
force,
and
in
fact,
is
pernicious.
if
the
government
could
be
estopped
by
making
a
partial
disclosure
and
thus
held
responsible
for
disclosing
additional
information,
it
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
voluntary
disclosures
under
the
act.
now,
whether
admiral
turner
made
the
correct
decision
in
1977
or
'78
to
disclose
some
of
the
institutions,
i
don't
know.
perhaps
some
of
those
institutions
that
were
disclosed
could
in
fact
lead
to
the
identification
of
the
researchers.
but
it
is
not
our
burden
today
to
justify
the
disclosures
that
were
made.
it
is
to
justify
the
information
that
was
withheld.
and
this
kind
of
estoppel
argument
being
used
against
the
government,
if
credited,
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
kind
of
voluntary
disclosures
that
go
on
every
day
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
because
we
would
be
afraid
if
we
disclosed
some
information
voluntarily,
that
that
would
be
held
against
us,
and
we
would
have
to
disclose
some
other
information
we
didn't
want
to.
for
that
reason,
we
think
the
arguments
raised
in
the
cross
petition
should
be
rejected.
if
i
could
return
briefly
to
a
couple
of
points
that
were
raised
with
regard
to
the
principal
issues
in
this
case,
the
respondents
seem
to
be
arguing
that
section
403(d)(3)
should
not
be
given
its
plain
language
meaning
because
we
can
protect
intelligence
sources
when
we
have
to
under
the
classification
exemption,
exemption
1,
or
maybe
because
they
are
methods
rather
than
sources.
this
is
simply
an
illegitimate
form
of
argument
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
each
provision
in
the
act
stands
on
its
own
feet.
if
we
qualify
under
exemption
3,
we
qualify,
even
if
another
exemption
might
also
be
available
in
some
cases.
that
is
precisely
the
argument
respondents
are
making
that
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
fbi
v.
abramson
where
the
court
held
that
the
availability
of
possibly
an
exemption
6
argument
should
not
distort
the
way
exemption
7
was
interpreted
under
that
case.
it
is
our
position
here,
too,
the
fact
that
something
might
also
be
a
method
as
well
as
a
source,
or
might
also
be
classifiable,
doesn't
keep
it
from
being
a
source
within
the
plain
language
of
section
403(d)(3).
the
question
was
raised,
well,
why
should
congress
care
more
about
protecting
intelligence
sources
and
methods
under
403(d)(3)
than
other
kinds
of
classified
information,
under
(b)(1)
which
are
subject
to,
it
is
alleged,
a
more
intensive
kind
of
judicial
review?
we
don't
know.
that's
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
it
is
not
necessary
that
congress
in
enacting
various
statutes
over
a
period
of
time
always
act
from
a
coherent
pattern.
but
a
good
reason
might
be
that
intelligence
sources
and
methods
are
like
the
goose
that
lays
the
golden
egg:
if
those
are
endangered
or
compromised,
then
additional
disclosures
will
not
occur.
our
country
has
always
treated
intelligence
sources
and
methods
as
the
most
highly
sensitive
kind
of
classified
information
or
of
national
security
information
because
when
they
are
compromised,
it
compromises
our
ability
to
learn
future
intelligence.
that
is
amply
demonstrated
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
act.
this
court
has
frequently
remarked
upon
it
in
its
decisions
such
as
snepp
and
haig
v.
agee,
that
the
confidentiality
of
intelligence
sources
is
of
preeminent
importance.
so
if
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
justify
what
congress
did
in
its
plain
language,
there
is
the
justification.
finally,
with
regard
to
the
ability
to
protect
open
and
secret
sources,
403(d)(3)
is
not
limited
to
secret
intelligence
sources.
it
talks
about
intelligence
sources
generally.
in
the
hearings
that
led
up
to
the
1947
act,
the
testimony
was
quite
clear,
the
testimony
which
was
cited
at
page
16
of
our
petition,
quoted
there
by
general
vandenberg,
who
had
been
the
director
of
cia's
predecessor
operation,
said
that
he
thought
roughly
80
percent
of
intelligence
should
normally
be
based
on
open
sources,
including
books,
magazines,
technical
and
scientific
surveys,
photographs,
commercial
analyses,
newspapers,
and
radio
broadcasts.
so
it
is
our
position
that
congress
quite
clearly
intended
that
the
term
"intelligence
sources"
would
comprehend
both
open
as
well
as
secret
sources,
and
that
in
giving
the
director
of
central
intelligence
the
authority
to
protect
intelligence
sources
and
methods
from
unauthorized
disclosure,
it
was
intended
to
be
interpreted
broadly,
and
that
there
is
no
basis
for
the
second
part
of
the
two-part
test
created
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
that
will
conclude
my
argument.
