justice
blackmun
was
that
a
decision
of
a
single
judge,
or
was
it
reviewed
by
the
court?
justice
blackmun
mr.
nicholas.
justice
blackmun
do
you
draw
any
distinction
at
all
between
the
certificates
of
deposit,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
passbook
savings
account
on
the
other?
justice
blackmun
if
you
prevail
here,
how
is
the
gain
taxed?
justice
blackmun
as
a
practical
matter,
how
is
that
enforceable?
justice
blackmun
but
it
certainly
is
unusual
to...
when
money
cash
is
drawn
out
of
say
a
passbook
savings
account,
to
have
gain
realized
thereby.
i'm
just
wondering
how
the
commissioner
ever
would...
would
enforce
it
if
a
taxpayer
overlooked
including
it.
justice
blackmun
well,
there
is
some...
there
is
some
difference.
certainly
with
stock
one
has
a
stock
certificate,
and
it
has
to
be
turned
in.
but
with
just
a
savings
account,
a
passbook
savings
account,
your
client
draws
out
$100,
there's
no
other
certificate
or
title
that
gets
passed
the
way
there
is
with
a
stock
certificate.
i
realize
the
solicitor
general
makes
no
point
of
this.
he
merely
mentions
it
as
a...
with
a
passing
reference.
but
i'm
a
little
concerned
about
the
practicalities
of
it,
i
guess.
justice
blackmun
well,
suppose
it
doesn't?
it
certainly
is
unusual
to
have
basis
in
cash
less
than
face
value,
isn't
it?
