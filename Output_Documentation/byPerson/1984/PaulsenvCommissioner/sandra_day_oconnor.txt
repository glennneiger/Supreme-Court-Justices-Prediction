justice
o'connor
would
there
be
any
justification
on
that
latter
point
for
taking
the
position
that
as
soon
as
the
time
expired
so
that
the
paulsens
could
withdraw
the
funds
from
the
saving
account
that
it
would
become
taxable,
as
opposed
to
when
they
actually
withdraw?
justice
o'connor
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00.
mr.
nicholas,
you
may
resume.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lauber,
had
the
taxpayer
obtained
stock
in
a...
or
obtained
the
interest
obtained
in
this
case
on
a
merger
with
another
mutual,
assuming
the
ownership
had
been
in
a
mutual
to
begin
with,
there
would
have
been
a
tax-free
reorganization
apparently?
justice
o'connor
and
if
there'd
been
a
mutual
into
a
stock
type
savings
and
loan--
justice
o'connor
--it
would
be
a
tax-free
reorganization?
justice
o'connor
or
a
stock
type
into
a
stock
type.
justice
o'connor
so
it's
just
this
one
instance
where
it's
a
stock
type
into
a
mutual--
justice
o'connor
--that
irs
takes
a
contrary
view.
and
that's
a
little
hard
to
understand.
justice
o'connor
well,
is
our
proper
inquiry,
since
it
meets
technically
the
statutory
requirements
for
a
tax-free
reorganization,
is
our
inquiry
in...
should
it
be
directed
to
whether
it's
a
continued
proprietary
interest?
is
that
our
whole
focus
here?
justice
o'connor
well,
does
this
mean
that
in
the
future
you
would
be
urging
that
we
would
apply
a
similar
analysis
to
all
hybrid
instruments...
for
instance,
preferred
stock
received
on
a
reorganization?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
you
can
make
the
same
kind
of
an
argument.
if
you're
going
to
open
it
up
into
looking
into
hybrid
instruments
in
the
way
you
suggest,
i
suppose
a
lot
of
exchanges
in
the
future
would
be
at
risk
that
hadn't
been
questioned
so
far.
justice
o'connor
well,
doesn't
that
assume
the
answer
to
say
what
they
got
back
was
a
garden
variety
savings
account?
the
whole
question
is
whether
an
account
in
a
mutual
organization
is
a
garden
variety
account.
justice
o'connor
it
carries
characteristics
that
may
make
it
equivalent
to
a
proprietary
interest.
that's
the
whole
point.
and
you
keep
sliding
over
that
and
treating
it
a
something
different.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lauber,
had
the
commissioner
taken
a
contrary
position
prior
to
1969?
justice
o'connor
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
commissioner
treated
it
differently
and
thought
it
was
a
proprietary
interest
to
have
an
account
in
a
mutual
before
that
time.
so
was
the
earlier
commissioner
bamboozled,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
mr.
nicholas,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
respond...
enable
you
to
respond
to
justice
stevens'
last
question?
