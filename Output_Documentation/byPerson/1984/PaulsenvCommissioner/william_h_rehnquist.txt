justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
mistaken
in
determining
that
the
right
to
share
residual
value...
residual
proceeds
had
no
value,
do
you
rely
on
some
sort
of
evidence
or
somewhere
that
that
type
of
thing
does
have
a
market
value?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
say
in
response
to
your
opponent's
contention
that
the
elliot
case
and
some
others
have
recognized
the
fact
that
there
is
a
residual
value
that
the
owners
have?
justice
rehnquist
but
in
those
other
cases
i
take
it
that
the
residual
value
may
not
have
appeared
until
liquidation.
might
not
the
same
thing
happen
here,
that
if
they
decide
to
liquidate,
perhaps
there
would
be
some
residual
value?
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
a
question
of
fact,
isn't
it?
i
mean
certainly
this
court
can't
just
by
picking
out
law
books
and
citing
precedents
know
whether
something
like
that
does
have
a
value
or
not.
justice
rehnquist
well,
sometimes
a
bond
is
issued
at
a
discount.
i
don't
know
that
it's
necessarily
always
factually
true
that
a
promissory
note
from
a
particular
obligor
is
always
worth
the
face
value
at
the
time
it's
issued,
which
is
your
assumption,
i
take
it.
justice
rehnquist
but
that...
that's
a
very
abstract,
hypothetical
type
of
argument
you're
making;
that
because...
and,
you
know,
you
can
certainly
argue
that,
but
we're
not
a
fact-finding
tribunal.
has
there
ever
been
a
specific
finding
of
fact
by
any
court
that
purported
to
find
facts
in
this
case
that
there
was
or
was
not
a
value
to
the
so-called
equity
interest?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
this
outfit
were
to
merge
into
some
other
outfit?
justice
rehnquist
yeah.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
it
were
mutual
to
stock?
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
your...
your
opponent
disagrees
with
you,
and
i
wonder
if
these
aren't
arguments
that
should
be
made
to
a
fact-finding
tribunal
to
a
tribunal
that
simply
decides
questions
of
law.
