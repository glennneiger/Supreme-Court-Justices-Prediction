mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
happened
here
is
that
petitioners
sold
their
stock
for
the
equivalent
cash.
we
think
they
should
be
required
to
pay
tax
on
their
gain
just
as
anybody
else
would
have
to
do.
it
might
be
helpful
to
begin
with
an
analogy.
imagine
a
wise
investor
who
buys
stock
in
a
corporation
like
ibm
when
it's
still
a
new
company.
the
company
prospers,
and
the
investor
finds
over
time
that
his
stock
has
quadrupled
in
value.
at
that
time
our
wise
investor
might
well
decide
that
he
had
a
great
deal
of
wealth
tied
up
in
that
relatively
risky
equity
investment,
that
what
has
gone
up
might
well
come
down,
and
that
it
would
be
prudent
to
take
his
profits
and
convert
that
relatively
risky
equity
investment
into
a
safer
and
more
liquid
form.
now,
if
our
investor
chose
to
do
that
by
selling
his
stock
on
the
open
market
for
cash,
he'd
have
to
pay
tax
on
his
gain.
and
the
result
would
be
the
same
if
instead
of
selling
his
stock
for
cash,
he
sold
it
for
short-term
notes
or
bonds
issued
by
any
individual
or
by
a
corporation.
that's
basically
what
happened
here.
petitioners
bought
stock
in
commerce
when
it
was
a
very
new
savings
and
loan
company.
the
company
prospered.
by
1976,
petitioners
found
that
their
stock,
which
they
had
paid
$50,000
for,
was
now
worth
about
$200,000.
they
may
have
thought
this
was
a
good
time
to
sell
their
stock.
interest
rates
had
been
declining
for
about
two
years
at
this
period...
at
this
period.
savings
and
loans
were
doing
very
well.
now,
if
petitioners
chose
to
sell
their
stock
for
cash
or
for
promissory
notes
to
an
individual
or
a
corporation,
they
would
have
had
to
pay
tax
on
their
gain;
and
it
would
make
no
difference
if
they
chose
as
a
mechanism
for
selling
their
stock
a
statutory
merger.
for
example,
if
commerce
had
merged
into
an
ordinary
corporation
and
petitioners
gave
up
their
stock
and
got
back
corporate
bonds
or
promissory
notes,
they'd
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
their
gain.
if
commerce
had
merged
into
a
commercial
bank
and
petitioners
gave
up
their
stock
and
got
back
bank
deposits,
or
savings
accounts
or
cds,
they'd
have
to
pay
tax
on
their
gain.
and
if
commerce
had
merged
into
a
stock
savings
and
loan
association,
and
petitioners
gave
up
their
stock
and
got
back
not
stock,
which
would
have
been
a
relatively
risky
investment,
but
savings
accounts,
they
would
have
had
to
pay
tax
on
their
gain.
the
only
question
here,
therefore,
is
whether
the
result
should
be
different
merely
because
the
vehicle
petitioners
chose
to
cash
out
their
investment
was
a
merger
not
with
a
bank
or
with
a
stock
savings
and
loan,
but
with
a
mutual
savings
and
loan
whose
savings
accounts
happened
to
carry
with
them
certain
proprietary
features
like
the
right
to
vote.
we
submit
such
a
difference
in
outcome
is
unjustifiable
because
those
proprietary
interests
simply
have
no
value.
we
think
the
entire
case
boils
down
to
one
simple
proposition.
it's
clear
that
if
petitioners
had
sold
their
stock
for
bank
deposits,
it
would
have
had
to
pay
tax.
there's
no
reason
why
the
result
should
be
different,
that
they
should
be
able
to
avoid
paying
tax
because
they
sold
their
stock
for
bank
deposits
plus
something
else
where
that
something
else
has
no
economic
value.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
our...
our
position
is
that
we
had
a
mutual
merging
into
another
mutual.
nothing
really
happens.
the
mutual
account
holders
get
back
their
exact
same
account
with
a
different
obligor
on
the
passbook.
the
name
of
the
obligor
changes.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
there
again,
typically
the
mutual--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--we
agree
with
that
as
well,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
would
also
be
tax
free,
or
it
could
be
done
tax
free.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
reason
is
it's
only
in
this
stock
into
mutual
regime
where
you
have
shareholders
cashing
out
an
equity
investment.
in
the
other
examples,
mutual
into
mutual
or
mutual
into
stock,
the
old
account
holders
remain
account
holders.
there's
simply
a
different
name
on
the
passbook
of
the
obligor.
it's
not
an
appropriate
occasion
for
taxing
anybody.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
one
of
our
two
submissions;
that
there
is
no
continuing
proprietary
interest
because
the
value
of
the
proprietary
interest
obtained
is
very
close
to
zero,
and
that
is
not
a
substantial
interest
within
the
meaning
of
minnesota
tea
and
this
court's
other
cases.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
preferred
stock
has
always
been
treated
by
the
commissioner
as
stock.
convertible
bonds--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that's
true,
justice
o'connor,
because
this
interest
here
on
its
face
is
not
stock;
it's
a
savings
account.
and
i
think
it's
not
we
but
petitioners
who
are
trying
to
recharacterize
this
as
something
other
than
it
is.
and
the
normal
case
of
preferred
stock
would
never
be
recharacterized...
typically
would
not
be
recharacterized
as
that
unless
it
were
a
very,
very
shaky
corporation.
and
i
don't
think
this
position
we're
taking
here
is
inconsistent,
because
the
point
of
the
continuity
of
proprietary
interest
test
is
to
find
out
if
the
shareholder
has
cashed
out
or
continued
his
equity
investment.
here,
these
people
clearly
cashed
out
their
investment.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
is
our
position.
but
i
would...
i
would--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think,
justice
powell,
that
congress
never
really
spoke
to
that.
congress
plainly
recognized
on
different
occasions
that
a
merger
that
takes
the
form
of
a
merger
could
be
characterized
as
a
sale,
even
where
s&ls
are
involved.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
fact
that
commerce
could
not
merge
into
citizens
the
way
they
did
it
doesn't
mean
that
commerce
could
not
have
effected
a
merger.
commerce
could
have
found
a
stock
savings
and
loan
and
merged
with
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that's
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
may
i
finish
answering
your
first
one?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
other
alternative
commerce
had
was
to
have
citizens
convert
from
a
federal
mutual
association
into
a
federal
stock
association.
that
conversion--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--right.
but
if
they
wanted
to
merge
with
that
company,
they
could
have
converted
citizens
from
a
mutual
into
a
stock
organization.
the
irs
has
ruled
that
that
conversion
would
be
tax
free.
following
the
conversion,
commerce
could
have
merged
into
citizens
on
a
stock-for-stock
exchange,
and
that
would
have
been
tax
free.
now,
the
only
down
side
to
that
would
be
that
petitioners
would
have
had
to
take
back
stock
rather
than
savings
account,
and
could
therefore
not
have
cashed
out
their
equity
investment.
but
that
down
side
is
a
down
side
the
revenue
code
imposes
when
people
sell
their
stock
for
cash.
so
the
commissioner
here
is
not
obstructing
mergers.
and
relevant
to
the
petitioners'
concerns
about
the
health
of
the
s&l
industry,
i
should
make
the
point
what
the
effect
of
this
cashing
out
process
is
on
the
balance
sheet
of
the
corporation
and
therefore
on
its
financial
health.
when
petitioners
owned
stock
in
commerce,
their
stock
investment
was
reflected
on
the
balance
sheet
as
a
large
retained
earning
shareholder's
equity
account.
that
account
functioned
as
a
reserve
or
cushion
that
protected
the
organization
and
the
deposits
against
the
risk
of
loss.
as
a
result
of
the
merger,
petitioners
gave
up
their
equity
interest
and
got
back
garden
variety
savings
accounts.
now,
the
effect
of
that
was
to
convert
what
used
to
be
a
cushion,
a
shareholder's
equity,
into
a
short-term
debt
obligation
of
the
organization;
and
therefore,
the
effect
of
this
by
cashing
these
people
out
was,
relatively
speaking,
to
diminish
rather
than
enhance
the
well-being
of
the
society.
and
the
point
is--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
let's
analyze
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
let
me
address
it
more
directly
then,
because
that
is
the
key
question
in
the
case.
i
think
one
reason
the
courts
of
appeals
have
occasionally
had
trouble
seeing
the
common
sense
truth
of
our
position
is
that
the
mutual
savings
account
are
kind
of
a
freak
of
nature
in
modern
american
society,
because
they
are...
you
have
one
piece
of
paper
that
has
the
dichotomous
qualities
of
debt
and
equity
at
the
same
time.
and
it
might
be
helpful
if
we
could
imagine
splitting
up
that
one
piece
of
paper
into
two
discrete
instruments;
that
is,
imagine
here
that
petitioners
gave
up
their
stock
in
commerce
and
got
back
two
pieces
of
paper.
the
first
piece
of
paper,
let's
say,
would
be
a
corporate
iou.
i
owe
you
$200,000
payable
on
demand,
plus
interest.
that
would
be
a
garden
variety
bank
deposit.
they
also
got
back
a
second
piece
of
paper
which
we
might
call
a
membership
certificate
in
citizens
that
said
you're
hereby
a
member,
and
you
can
vote
and
so
forth.
the
question
is
is
that
second
piece
of
paper
worth
anything;
would
anybody
pay
you
any
money
for
that
second
piece
of
paper?
i
think
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
some...
it's
possible
that
some
merger
deals
might
be
constructed
where
you
might
be
able
to
kick
out
a
little
bit
of
bonus
money
to
the
mutual
shareholders,
but
that
was
not
done
here.
the
facts
of
this
merger
agreement
show
that
the
parties
who
negotiated
the
deal
placed
absolutely
no
economic
value
on
these
residual
proprietary
interests.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it's
possible,
although
this
court
in
society
for
savings
v.
bowers
characterized
that
residual
interest
in
the
liquidation
as
being
so
remote
a
contingency
as
to
reduce
to
the
vanishing
point
on
the
theory
that
the
solvent
liquidation
of
an
s&l
is
very
unlikely.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
could
point
out
that
the
federal
home
bank...
home
loan
bank
board,
which
must
approve
liquidation,
has
never
approved
liquidation
of
a
solvent
federal
savings
and
loan.
and
that
fact
is
recorded
in
the
york
case
of
1980
and
revenue
ruling
80-105.
so,
in
fact,
these
things...
maybe
there
have
been
liquidations
of
state
s&ls,
but
not
of
federal
s&ls
like
citizens.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
is
contrary
to
all
those
courts.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
they
were
just...
they
were
just
bamboozled
by
the
form
of
the
thing
and--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--they
never
looked
to
the
substance
of
it.
but
to
go
back
to
my
example--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
we
didn't
just
come
along
now.
we
were
on
the
public
record
in
1969
as
ruling
that
a
stock
into
a
mutual
merger
where
the
old
shareholders
are
cashed
out
does
not
qualify
for
tax-free
treatment.
that
ruling
antedated
all
the
court
of
appeals
cases,
and
we
kept
litigating
it
in
court
after
court;
and
now
we
finally
won
one,
and
that's
why
we're
in
this
court,
and
you're
the
supreme
court.
and
the
fact
that
people
may
have
relied
on
lower
court
opinions
in
the
face
of
our
obvious
resistance
doesn't
set
up
any
estoppel
of
alliance
interest
they
can
rely
on.
they
knew
there
was
a
risk
that
the
commissioner
would
always
contend
that
this
merger
was
not
a
tax-free
reorganization.
and
they
took
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
don't
think--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
as
i
understand
it,
the
commissioner
had
not
taken
any
public
ruling
position
on
the
question
before
1969.
there
was
an
in-house
position
which
may
have
been
reflected
in
some
private
letter
rulings
to
the...
to
support
the
petitioners'
position.
but
what
happened
in
1968
is
that
the
commissioner
received
a
huge
barrage
of
requests
for
private
letter
rulings
as
to
the
tax
results
of
this
kind
of
merger.
people
wanted
him
to
bless
one
of
these
mergers
in
advance.
the
reason
for
that,
i
think,
is
that
between
october
of
1966
and
august
of
'68
the
value
of
savings
and
loan
stocks
as
reflected
in
standard
8
poor's
s&l
index
quintupled
in
value.
so
you
had
an
awful
lot
of
shareholders
in
stock
s&ls
with
a
huge
unrealized
gain
on
their
stock.
they
wanted
to
merge
and
cash
out
their
investment.
the
commissioner
got
this
huge
influx
of
requests
for
private
rulings,
and
the
rulings
branch
of
the
irs
realized
that
the
commissioner
had
not
looked
at
this
area
for
a
long
period
of
time.
during
the
interim,
up
until
'69,
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
there'd
been
a
long
series
of
congressional
amendments
to
the
both
banking
and
regulatory
and
tax
treatment
of
s&ls.
they
were
tax
exempt
until
1951,
and
congress
gradually
began
an
incremental
process
changing
the
way
they
were
treated.
at
the
same
time,
their
economic
function
changed.
they
became
less
and
less
like
true
mutual
organizations
and
more
and
more
like
banks.
that's
reflected
in
the
legislative
treatment.
so
what
happened
was
the
commissioner
got
this
huge
bunch
of
ruling
requests
and
decided
it
was
a
good
time
to
review
the
area
authoritatively
in
light
of
all
the
changes
that
had
occurred
on
the
congressional
front,
and
he
did
so
and
issued
the
three
rulings
in
question.
and
i
think
that
this
is
simply
a
reasoned
response
to
changes
in
the
economy
and
in
the
way
congress
treated
these
organizations.
they
are
really
not
like...
like
true
mutual
organizations.
they're
like
banks
that
pay
rate
of
return
like
banks
pay
interest,
and
they're
just
fungible
with
other
financial
institutions.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
believe
they
are,
because
the
case--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that's
in
the
record,
because
the
case
is
stipulated
on
the
tax
court,
and
there's
a
very
brief
set
of
stipulated
facts.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
in
commerce,
that's
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
would
probably
be
peanuts
really,
because
when
you
think
about
it,
the--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--but
the
bulk
of
their
assets
are
mortgage
loans,
not,
you
know,
bricks
and
mortar
and
typewriters.
i
mean--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that...
there
could
be...
could
be
some.
but
it's
clear
that
the
parties
who
negotiated
the
merger
here
didn't
think
it
was
worth
anything,
because
the
merger
agreement
says
that...
places
a
value
of
$12
a
share
on
the
commerce
stock
petitioners
gave
up.
in
exchange
for
that,
each
share,
they
got
a
$12
deposit
in
a
citizens
passbook
account.
that
$12
deposit
consisted
of
the
right
to
withdraw
$12,
which
was
worth
$12,
plus
these
membership
rights.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
suppose
if
they
struck
oil
right
after
the...
after
the
merger,
and
they
were
then
to
liquidate
the
company,
the
shareholders--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--might
get...
might
find...
might
get
some...
something
beyond
their
savings
account.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
if
we
assume
that
these
people
negotiated
the
merger
at
arm's
length
and
that
the
savings
accounts...
or
an
arm's
length
rate
of
interest,
as
they
must
have
done,
the
right
to
withdraw
$12
from
a
federally-insured
savings
and
loan...
this
is
a
federally-insured
deposit
we're
talking
about...
must
be
equal,
more
or
less,
to
$12.
and
if
that's
so,
and
the
stock
they
gave
up
is
worth
$12,
there's
nothing
left...
there's
no
value
left
to
assign
any
value
to
those
proprietary
interests
they
got.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals...
i
guess
it
wasn't
really
a
finding
of
fact;
it
was
a
characterization...
said
that
the
proprietary
interest
had
no
value;
and
they
relied
on
a
number
of...
of
reasons
for
that.
and
it's
clear
if
one
looks
at
what
those
interests
are
that
they
don't
have
a
great
deal
of
value.
i
mean
the
right
to
vote
in
a
savings
and
loan
has
no
value
on
its
face,
and
in
practice,
most
s&l
account
holders
sign
away
their
right
to
vote
when
they
open
their
account
by
executing
a
proxy
to
management
in
favor
of
management
to
vote
their
votes
on
behalf
of
them.
i
doubt
if
there's
anybody
in
this
room
who's
ever
voted
in
a
savings
and
loan
association.
it's
just
not
the
kind
of
thing
people
would
pay
money
for.
and
the
right
to
share
in
the
liquidation
proceeds
again
was
extremely
contingent
and
speculative,
because
you
would
have
to
get
federal
home
loan
bank
board
approval
for
a
liquidation,
and
they've
never
approved
liquidation
of
a
solvent
s&l.
so
if
you
kind
of
break
the
rights
down
on
a
piece-by-piece
basis,
it's
clear
that
no
one
would
pay
any
money
for
those
interests;
and
that
fact
is
reflected
in
the...
in
the
merger
agreement.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
if
citizens
were
to
merge
into
another
organization?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it
would
depend
on
how
that
merger
were...
were
constructed.
if
it
were
a
mutual
to
mutual
merger,
the
citizens
people
would
just
get
back
another
savings
account
in
the
same
amount--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--if
it
was
a
mutual
to
stock,
the
way
those
deals
are
done
in
practice,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
mutual
account
holder
will
get
back
another
account
in
the
same
dollar
amount
from
the
new
enterprise.
and
beyond
that,
he
will
get
what's
called
a
liquidation
account
equal
to
his
residual
interest
in
the
ultimate
liquidation
value.
the
way
these
deals
are
done
in
practice,
a
liquidation
account
is
simply
a
balance
sheet
entry.
the...
the
account
holder
cannot
sell
it,
exchange
it
or
cash
in
on
it
in
any
way.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
all
these
arguments
are
simply
directed
to
show
that
the
interest
these
people
got
beyond
the
interest
of
account
holders
as
proprietors
was
not
substantial.
whether
it
was
zero
or
one-tenth
of
one
percent
or
two
percent,
it
was
not
substantial.
and
this
court
set
out
the
relevant
test
in
minnesota
tea
where
it
said
that
the
shareholders
of
the
old
enterprise
must
get
a
proprietary
ownership
interest
that
represents
a
substantial
part
of
the
value
of
the
thing
transferred.
the
thing
transferred
here
was
the
commerce
stock.
the
value
of
the
thing
transferred
was
$12
per
share.
and
i
think
it's
clear--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--but
the
thing
is
the
petitioners
would
never
get
anything
beyond
the...
what
was,
in
effect,
a
passbook
rate
of
interest.
i
mean
given
the
market
place
and
the
competition
among
banks
and
different
kinds
of
s&ls,
they're
all
paying
competitive
rates
of
interest;
and
it's
not
the
case
that
the
mutual
s&l
because
between
earnings
will
pay
a
higher
rate
of
interest.
they
all
pay
the
same
thing.
and
therefore,
the
account
holder
can
never
cash
in
on
the
earnings
power,
because
all
he
ever
gets,
all
he's
entitled
to
is
that
basic
rate
of
interest,
the
market
rate
of
interest.
so
although
he
has
a
notional
interest
in--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
don't
think...
no,
as
i
understand
it,
there
usually
isn't
any
linkage
between
stock
ownership
and
depositor
status
in
a
stock
s&l.
in
fact,
usually
the
two
groups
of
people
are
totally
separate.
and
i
think
normally
it
would
be
possible
if
you
had
a
stock-for-stock
deal
and
got
stock
back,
you
could
keep
your
deposit
and
sell
your
stock
or
vice-versa.
there'd
be
no
automatic
linkage
between
the
two.
i'd
like
to
make
one
final
kind
of
argument
that...
directed
to
petitioners'
contention
that
their
concern
is
with
the
health
of
the
savings
and
loan
industry.
they
point
out
that
the
s&l
industry
is
currently
in
a
depressed
situation,
that
congress
has
often
voiced
the
intention
to
help
them
out,
and
that
the
commissioner
should
not
be
able
to
come
along
and
throw
a
big
tax
monkey
wrench
into
the
deal
and
prevent
an
otherwise
desirable
s&l
merger.
i'd
like
to
point
out
first
of
all
that
the
commissioner
has
publicly
ruled
that
the
vast
majority
of
s&l
mergers
can
be
done
tax
free;
that
is,
mutual
to
mutual,
mutual
to
stock,
and
stock
into
stock.
furthermore,
commerce
here,
had
they
wanted
to
merge
tax
free,
could
have
had
citizens
convert
to
a
stock
form
of
organization,
which
would
have
been
tax
free,
and
then
do
a
stock-for-stock
transaction.
that
would
have
been
bad
for
petitioners,
because
they
would
have
had
to
get
back
stock
rather
than
cash
and
therefore
pay
tax
in
order
to
avoid
paying
tax.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
would
not,
justice
powell,
because
in
that
event
it
would--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--right.
because
in
order
for
this
to
be--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--no,
we
would
not
say
a
long-term
bond
is
equity.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no,
that
would
not
be
equity
either.
in
fact,
we're
ruled
that
convertible
bonds
are--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
right
to
vote
is
normally...
is
something
stockholders
normally
have,
so
that
people
who--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
fact
that
you
have
a
right
to
vote
doesn't
mean
you
have
stock.
i
mean
i
have
the
right
to
vote
in
charities
that
i
give
money
to,
but
that
doesn't
make
me
a
stockholder.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
what
you
need
to
have
an
equity
interest
is
more
than
a
right
to
vote
in
an
organization.
you
need
to
have
some
real
stake
in
the...
some
risky
stake--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that's
right.
and
here
there
is
no
bottom...
no
real
down
side
risk
because
they
had...
these
people
got
a
federally-insured
savings
account.
a
stockholder
in
a
normal
corporation
has
unlimited
down
side
risk
and
unlimited
up
side
potential,
plus
the
right
to
dividends--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--could
you
give
that
to
me
again?
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
take--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that
would--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--the
commissioner
has
probably
ruled
on
that
kind.
i
don't
know
what
the
ruling
is.
i
would
suspect
that
that
would
held...
would
be
held
to
be
stock,
because
there
is
a
risk
of
nondividends
for
the
entire
period
of
the
ownership
prior
to
redemption,
and
the
risk
the
company
could
go
bankrupt,
and
you'd
get
nothing
at
all.
so
i
would
suspect
that
would
be
stock.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
record
reflects
that.
i
would...
i'd
suspect
the
normal
practice
is
that
it
would
be
transferrable
independently.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
reflects
whether
the
shares
were
freely
transferrable
before
the
merger.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
mean
if...
if
it
were
the
case
they
had
to
simply
withdraw
their
money
from
the
account
in
order
to
sell
their
stock,
that
wouldn't
be
a
terribly
onerous
burden
really.
i
mean
it
wouldn't
be
like
a
restrictive
stock
agreement
where
you
couldn't
sell
at
all.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no.
i
think
the...
if
that
were
true
beforehand,
that
you
couldn't
sell
your
stock
unless
you
also
withdrew
your
money
from
the
institution,
you
could
simply
withdraw
your
money
and
sell
your
stock.
i
mean
it
wouldn't
be...
you
wouldn't
have
to
satisfy
anybody
of
anything
before
you
did
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
it
does.
