justice
jr.
mr.
lauber,
isn't
the
government's
position
as
simple
as
this:
that
there
can
never
be
a
tax-free
measure
of
a
stock
s&l
into
a
mutual
s&l?
justice
jr.
do
you
think
congress
intended
that
in
the
reorganization
act?
justice
jr.
you're
not
assuming
that
one
who
wishes
to
merge
always
can
find
precisely
the
partner
that
would
be
desirable,
most
desirable?
in
other
words,
mergers
are
the
result
of
a
great
many
considerations.
justice
jr.
let
me
ask
another
question.
justice
jr.
yes,
sure.
justice
jr.
or
they
couldn't
have
merged
at
all.
justice
jr.
mr.
lauber.
mr.
lauber,
may
i
ask
this
question?
do
you
agree
that
your
position
is
contrary
to
that
taken
by
two
courts
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
claims,
and
two
district
courts?
justice
jr.
and
is
it
your
suggestion
that
all,
what
is
it,
five
of
those
failed
to
exercise
common
sense
and
good
judgment?
[laughter]
justice
jr.
bamboozled
by
whom?
justice
jr.
wait
just
a
minute.
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
what
about
the
problem
of
being
fair
to
taxpayers
generally?
i
realize
the
reputation
of
the
internal
revenue
service
is
very
technical
and
not
necessarily
always
fair,
and
i
would
understand
that.
but
here
you
have
a
case
where
since
1971
if
a
lawyer
were
advised
or
asked
to
advise
a
client,
he
would
find
that
cases
uniformly
have
taken
a
position
contrary
to
the
one
you
take
here
today.
i
realize
the
commissioner
has
never
acquiesced
in
it,
but
what
do
people
do
when
they
wish
to
consider
a
measure,
counsel
tells
them
that
five
courts,
including...
well,
the
tax
court
would
make
six...
have
said
that
they
may
do
so
on
a
tax-free
basis?
and
here
they
come
along,
and
the
government
says
you've
got
to
pay
us
some
taxes.
is
that
fair?
justice
jr.
mr.
lauber?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
assume
that
the
consideration
received
by
the
stockholders
of
commerce
in
the
merger
had
been
ten-year
notes,
nothing
else,
and
the
notes
had
the
same
equity
interest
that
the
cds
and
the
savings
account
had
in
this
case;
that
is,
a
right
to
vote
and
the
right
in
the
event
of
litigation...
of
liquidation
to
participate.
would
that
make
any
difference
to
your
position?
justice
jr.
so
it...
it's
immaterial
how
long
they...
they
had
the
right
to
vote,
for
example.
justice
jr.
you
would...
you
would
concede
that's
normally
an
equity
interest,
wouldn't
you?
justice
jr.
if
it
had
the
right
to
vote?
justice
jr.
it's
a
proprietary
right.
don't
the
cases
say
that?
justice
jr.
yes.
if
you're
a
stockholder
in
commerce
and
you
end
up
with
only
the
right
to
vote
that
is
in
the
mutual
company,
don't
you...
haven't
you
retained
that
identical
right?
justice
jr.
what's
the
difference?
as
a
practical
matter,
what's
the
difference?
justice
jr.
if
you
had
a
common
stock
ownership,
what
would
you
have
other
than
the
right
to
vote?
you'd
have
the
possibility
of
appreciation
but
also
the
possibility
of
substantial
depreciation.
justice
jr.
suppose
you
had
a
capitalization
for
the
very
small
issue
of
prior
preferred
stock
outstanding
with
a
very
substantial
common
equity
underneath
it
so
your
preferred
stock
let's
say
matured
in
five
years
with
a
right
to
vote.
would
that
be
an
equity
interest?
justice
jr.
preferred
stock,
prior
preferred
stock
that...
that
had
to
be
surrendered
in
ten
years
or
could
be
redeemed
within
five
or
ten
years,
but
a
right
to
vote
accompanied
it.
would
that
be
a
proprietary--
justice
jr.
--would
that
be
a
proprietary
interest?
