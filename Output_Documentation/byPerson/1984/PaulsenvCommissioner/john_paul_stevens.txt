justice

do
you
think
those
additional
rights...
say
he
has
a
$100,000
account...
do
you
think
those
additional
rights
make
that
account
worth
more
than
$100,000?
justice
stevens
well,
could
he
sell
the
account
to
a
third
party
for
more
than
$100,000?
justice
stevens
if
it
had
market
value,
i
don't
know
why
not.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about...
you
mentioned
that
the
value
of
the
stock
before
the
merger,
the
stock
in
commerce,
was
set
up
on
the
balance
sheet
as
a
retained...
equivalent
to
the
retained
earnings.
are
the
balance
sheets
in
the
record
of
the
merging
companies?
justice
stevens
do
you
know
what,
for
example,
their
fixed
assets
were?
justice
stevens
i
gather
it's
your
position
that
the
stock,
in
effect,
represented
sort
of
the
net
worth
of
the
company,
the
excess
of
assets
over
liabilities.
justice
stevens
and
why
wouldn't
it
be
possible
that
after
the
merger
you
would
have
a
new
company
that
had
some
kind
of
big...
a
couple
of
buildings
and
maybe
owned
some
real
estate
and
one
thing
and
another,
in
which
there
would
be
fixed
assets
in
which
the
various
depositors
would
have
a
prorata
share
just
as
if
they
owned
stock?
and
if
so,
why
wouldn't
it
be
the
same
kind
of
proprietary
interest?
justice
stevens
well,
i've
been
in
some
pretty
big
savings
and
loan
company
buildings
that
are
pretty
fancy-looking
buildings.
justice
stevens
but
the
net
worth
sometimes
is
partially
represented
by
their
fixed
assets.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
also,
i
suppose
if
they
struck
oil
just
after
the
merger
in
the
new
company,
that
passbook
would
give
you
an
interest
in
the
oil
well,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
which
might
be
advisable
under
circumstances.
justice
stevens
on
that
substantiality
question,
may
i
just
interrupt
because
i'm
trying
to
think
this
thing
through.
presumably
the
assets...
i
notice
there
are
noncompetition
agreements
in
the
merger
here.
presumably
the
assets
have
some
earning
capacity
and
which
is
somewhat
higher
than
if
they
just
deposited
the
money
at
flat
interest
rates.
and
to
the
extent
that
that's
true,
isn't
that
the
amount
of
equity,
you
might
say,
that
they
have
here,
and
isn't
it
precisely
the
same
amount
it
would
have
been
if
it
had
been
a
stock-for-stock
transaction?
so
why
is
one
substantial
and
the
other
insubstantial?
justice
stevens
if
it
were
a
stock-for-stock
transaction,
could
he
sell
the
stock
separately
without
selling
his
account
after
a
merger?
say
this
had
been
a
stock-for-stock
transaction,
wouldn't
he
also
just
have
to
sell
that
when
he
closed
out
the
account?
isn't
that
how
these
things
work?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
factual
question?
prior
to
the
transaction
at
issue
in
this
case,
supposing
the
petitioners...
they
own,
i
think,
17,500
shares...
could
they
have
sold
1,000
of
those
shares
to
somebody
for
cash
without
changing
their...
their...
their
borrowing
account...
i
mean,
no,
their
deposit
accounts
at
the
institution?
in
other
words,
was
the
stock
in
commerce
transferrable
independent
of
the
bank
account?
justice
stevens
because
if
it...
if...
if
it
were,
then
it
would
be...
that
would
be
a
difference
between
the
character
of
the
ownership
before
the
merger
and
the
character
afterward...
the
character
of
the
ownership
interest
and
the
equity
in
that
institution.
but
you
say
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
that.
justice
stevens
because
if
they're
not,
they're
kind...
they're
really
not
much
different
from...
from
mutual
ownership.
justice
stevens
no,
but
it
would...
would
prevent
the
stock
from
having
an
independent
value
from
the
accounts.
it'd
be
a
prorata
interest
in
the
business
that
was
exactly
proportionate
to
the
prorata
interest
in
total
deposits,
which
is
what
you've
got
now.
justice
stevens
well,
you
say
the
record
doesn't
tell
us.
justice
stevens
they
could
be
sold
separately.
justice
stevens
but
you
didn't
bring
that
out
in
the
record.
i
wonder
why.
