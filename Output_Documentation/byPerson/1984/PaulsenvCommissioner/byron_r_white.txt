well,
it
says
between
the
bank,
though,
and
the...
and
the
account
holder
it
is.
he
can
draw
it
out
any
time
he
wants
to.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
after
that
he
can
draw
it
out
any
time
he
wants.
justice
white
you
would
know
how
much
gain
there
is,
wouldn't
you?
justice
white
and
in
advance.
so
the
first
dollar
you
draw
out,
is
that
all
gain
or
just
part?
justice
white
so
for
every
$100
there
would
be
x
dollars.
justice
white
and
if
he
draws
out
$100
and
then
he
deposits
$200--
justice
white
--and
then...
and
it
becomes
an
active
account,
how
would
you
ever
know?
justice
white
would
that
be
a
treasury
regulation
or
what?
