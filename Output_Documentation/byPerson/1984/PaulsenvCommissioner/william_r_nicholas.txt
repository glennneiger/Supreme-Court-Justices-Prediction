mr.
william
r.
nicholas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
for
decision
here
today
is
whether
the
owner
of
a
share
account
in
a
federal
mutual
savings
and
loan
associations
chartered
by
the
federal
government
has
a
proprietary
interest
in
that
association.
and
the
issue
arises
because
of
the
merger
of
commerce
savings
and
loan
association,
which
was
a
guaranteed
stock-type
savings
and
loan
association
organized
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
washington.
it
merged
with
and
into
citizens
federal
savings
and
loan
association,
which
was
a
federal
stock...
nonstock-type
mutual
savings
and
loan
association
which
was
owned
exclusively
by
the
share
account
owners
in
the
association.
in
the
transaction,
which
qualified
as
a
merger
under
state
law,
the
assets
and
liabilities
of
commerce
were
transferred
to
and
merged
with
the
assets
and
liabilities
of
citizens
federal.
citizens
federal
was
the
surviving
corporation
in
the
merger,
and
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
merger
agreement,
commerce
went
out
of
existence.
however,
citizens
continued
on
carrying
on
the
business...
that
of
loaning
money...
that
it
had
done
prior
to
the
merger,
and
also
carried
on
the
business
that
had
been
carried
on
by
commerce
prior
to
the
merger.
the
shareholders
of
commerce,
including
the
paulsens,
who
are
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
exchanged
their
stock
in
commerce
for
share
accounts
in
the
mutual
savings
and
loan
association.
the
mutual
association
has
only
one
form
of
equity,
and
that
is
the
share
memberships
in
its
association,
and
that
is
what
was
transferred
to
the
paulsens
in
this
case.
and
they
were
represented
by
passbook
and
certificate
accounts
in
citizens
federal.
thus,
after
the
merger,
the
business
of
the
two
associations
were
carried
on
by
one
organization,
and
the
owners
of
the
two
associations
prior
to
the
merger
were
the
same
owners
of
the
merged
association
at
the
completion
of
the
transaction.
the
two
associations
and
the
petitioners
in
this
case
treated
the
merger
as
a
tax-free
reorganization
under
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
therefore,
no
gain
was
recognized
by
commerce
on
the
transfer
of
its
assets
to
citizens
federal
and
no
gain
was
recognized
by
the
paulsens
on
the
transfer
of
their
guaranteed
stock
in
commerce
in
exchange
for
the
share
accounts
in
citizens
federal.
the
reorganization
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
defer
the
recognition
of
gain
on
the
transaction
that
qualifies
as
a
reorganization.
thus,
until
such
time
as
citizens
federal
sold
the
assets
which
it
acquired
in
the
merger,
it
would
not
have
any
gain
on
the
transaction,
and
until
such
time
as
the
paulsens
liquidated
their
investment
in
citizens
federal,
they
would
not
recognize
any
gain
on
the
transaction.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
yes.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the
withdrawal
of
the
savings
account
or
what
are
termed
savings
account
causes
a
loss
of
the
rights
that
are
conferred
upon
the
paulsens
by
the
mutual
savings
and
loan
association;
so
that
at
the
time
they
withdraw,
then
they
lose
the
right
to
share
in
any
further
profits
of
the
savings
and
loan
association,
and
they
lose
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
share
in
any
proceeds
upon
the
termination
or
liquidation
of
the
mutual
association.
the
respondent
asserted
a
deficiency
against
the
petitioners,
claiming
that
there
was
no
reorganization,
and
therefore
that
gain
had
to
be
recognized
by
the
paulsens
on
the
difference
between
their
basis
in
the
shares
of
the
guarantee
stock
association
which
they
exchanged
for
the
passbook
accounts
in
citizens
federal.
the
case
was
taken
to
the
tax
court,
and
the
tax
court
agreed
with
the
petitioners
and
held
that
the
merger
of
commerce
into
citizens
was
a
reorganization
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
any
gain
that
the
paulsens
might
have
recognized
would
be
deferred.
the
tax
court
in
analyzing
the
transaction--
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
--it
was
the
decision
of
a
single
judge,
your
honor.
judge
featherstone
made
the
decision.
the
transaction
the
tax
court
analyzed
met
the
statutory
requirements
set
forth
in
the
code,
and
under
the
applicable
provisions,
a
merger
is
included
within
the
definition
of
a
reorganization
under
section
368.
and
turning
to
section
7701
of
the
code,
which
provides
the
general
definitions
for
applications
throughout
the
code,
the
following
terms
are
included.
corporation
includes
association.
stock
includes
shares
in
an
association.
and
shareholder
includes
members
in
association.
thus,
commerce
transferred
property
to
citizens
federal,
a
mutual
associations
which
under
the
terms
of
the
internal
revenue
code
is
a
corporation;
and
therefore,
no
gain
was
recognized
under
section
361
of
the
code.
likewise,
the
petitioners
exchanged
stock
in
commerce
for
passbook
accounts
in
citizens
federal,
but
under
the
definitions
in
the
code,
those
passbook
accounts
are
shares
and
included
in
stock,
and
therefore
would
meet
the
requirements
of
the
code.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
connection
with
the
reorganization,
the
petitioners,
the
paulsens,
in
this
case
transferred
their
stock
in
commerce
for
share
accounts
in
the
citizens.
under
section
7701,
those
share
accounts
are
treated
as
stock,
and
therefore,
there
was
an
exchange
of
stock
for
stock,
and
no
gain
is
recognized
under
section
354
of
the
code.
however,
in
addition
to
the
statutory
language,
it
was
necessary
to
meet
certain
judicially
imposed
requirements
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
reorganization,
and
those
judicially
imposed
requirements
make
sure
that
the
spirit
of
the
law
is
carried
out
as
well
as
the
letter.
one
of
those
tests
is
the
continuity
of
proprietary
interest
test
which
distinguishes
between
pure
sales
of
assets
and
those
where
the
seller
has
a
continuing
proprietary
interest
in
the
transferee.
thus,
the
owners
of
the
acquired
entity,
commerce,
must
have
a
continuing
proprietary
interest
in
the
reorganized
enterprise
which
is
citizens
federal.
it
is
this
test
that
the
petition...
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
claims
that
the
petitioners
did
not
meet.
this
court,
in
a
series
of
landmark
decisions
nearly
50
years
ago,
defined
what
satisfies
the
continuity
of
proprietary
interest
test,
and
these
cases
are
still
used
by
the
financial
community
today
in
determining
when
a
reorganization
exists.
in
letulle
v.
scofield
there
was
a
transfer
of
assets
for
cash
and
notes,
and
the
court
held
that
did
not
satisfy
the
continuity
of
interest
test,
because
the
only
relationship
the
person
transferring
the
assets
to
the
continuing
corporation
had
was
that
of
a
debtor.
likewise,
in
pinellas
ice
&
cold
storage
company,
there
was
a
transfer
of
assets
for
cash
and
serial
bonds
which
were
secured
by
the
assets
which
were
transferred.
this
court
there
held
that
there
was
not
a
sufficient
equity
interest
in
the
transferee
corporation
because
there
still
was
only
a
debtor-creditor
relationship.
however,
in
minnesota
tea
v.
helvering,
the
receipt
of
voting
trust
certificates
by
this
court
was
held
to
satisfy
the
proprietary
interest,
and
thus,
a
reorganization
was
allowed.
in
the
minnesota
tea
case,
the
respondent
argued
that
the
petitioner
in
that
case
had
given
up
common
stock
and
only
received
back
voting
certificates,
and
therefore,
there
wasn't
a
good
reorganization.
but
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
statute
does
not
require
a
transferor
to
receive
back
the
same
equity
interest
that
it
gave
up,
as
long
as
it
has
an
equity
interest
in
the
continuing
operation.
and
likewise,
on
the
same
day
this
court
in
john
a.
nelson
company
v.
helvering
held
that
where
a
petitioner
had
transferred
common...
petitioner
who
had
common
stock
and
ended
up
with
preferred
stock
which
was
nonvoting,
redeemable,
that
there
was
a
sufficient
continuity
of
proprietary
interest
in
the
corporation
which
went
on
that
there
was
a
reorganization.
thus,
it
is
clear
from
these
tests
that
an
equity
interest
satisfies
the
continuity
of
interest
test,
and
it
must
not
be
necessarily
the
same
interest,
equity
interest
which
was
give
up
as
that
received.
debt,
however,
will
not
satisfy
the
test.
therefore,
the
question
comes
down
to
the
point
of
whether
the
interest
received
by
the
paulsens
in
this
case
was
an
equity
interest
in
the
continuing
corporation
which
was
a
citizens...
which
was
citizens
federal,
which
was
a
federal
mutual
savings
and
loan
association.
if
the
continuity
of
interest
test
is
not
met,
the
reorganization
fails,
and
it
is
not
tax-free
either
at
the
corporate
level
or
at
the
shareholder
level.
the
tax
court
examined
the
nature
of
the
interest
received
in
this
case
by
the
petitioners
and
held
that
the
petitioners
had
received
an
equity
interest,
not
debt,
that
satisfied
the
continuity
of
interest
test.
the
tax
court,
in
holding
there
was
a
reorganization,
recognized
the
congressional
intent
to
broadly
apply
the
reorganization
sections
to
encourage
combinations
of
corporations.
looking
at
the
senate
finance
committee
report
accompanying
the
1954
act,
it
shows
that
the
senate
had
rejected
a
narrow
definition
of
the
term
7701
of
the
code
which
provides
the
general
definition.
it
also
looked
back
to
the
original
income
act
of
1921
and
there
found
that
congress
sought
to
encourage
combinations
in
reorganizations
by
allowing
shareholders
to
receive
interest
in
the
ongoing
corporation
which
had
a
readily
realizable
market
value.
but
so
long
as
the
transferring
shareholder
kept
his
money
invested
in
that
ongoing
corporation
and
did
not
withdraw
it,
there
was
a
valid
reorganization.
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
contrary
both
to
the
reorganization
provisions
and
certainly
to
the
protection
and
encouragement
of
savings
and
loan
associations
which
congress
has
sought
to
encourage
over
the
years.
by
changing
his
position
in
1969,
the
respondent
has
discriminated
against
mutual
savings
and
loan
association
by
not
allowing
them
to
be
a
party
to
a
reorganization
where
a
stock
savings
and
loan
association
is
merged
into
a
mutual
savings
and
loan
association.
if
reorganizations
like
this
are
not
allowed,
it
has
a
harmful
effect
on
the
savings
and
loan
industry,
and,
for
instance,
in
this
case
if
the
reorganization
is
taxable
at
the
corporate
level
and
at
the
shareholder
level,
it
takes
away
those
funds
which
have
been
invested
by
the
shareholders
in
a
mutual
savings
and
loan
association
and
withdraws
them
from
the
market
which
makes
available
to
homeowners
mortgage
loans.
the
ninth
circuit
below
reversed
the
tax
court
and
found
that
the
interest
received
by
the
paulsens
in
this
case
constituted
debt
rather
than
a
proprietary
interest.
in
doing
so,
that
ninth
circuit
departed
from
an
unbroken
line
of
cases
that
had
previously
examined
the
issue.
the
court
of
claims
in
capital
savings
and
loan
association
held
that
such
an
interest
was
an
equity
proprietary
interest.
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
west
side
federal
also
held
that
such
an
interest
was
a
proprietary
interest.
and
in
everett
v.
the
united
states,
the
tenth
circuit
found
not
only
was
it
proprietary
interest,
but
it
constituted
voting
stock
under
the
more
narrow
definition
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
so-called
c
reorganization
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
tax
court,
of
course,
in
paulsen
had
reached
the
same
result,
and
also
in
the
subsequent
case
of
owens
had
found
that
there
was
a
valid
reorganization.
also,
two
district
courts
have
held
that
there
had
been
a
reorganization
on
the
same
facts...
district
courts
in
wyoming
and
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio.
also,
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
decision
below
ignored
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
which
had
examined
the
legal
characteristics
and
the
rights
and
obligations
of
a
shareholder
in
a
mutual
saving
and
loan
association.
and
lastly,
the
ninth
circuit
misapplied
the
continuity
of
proprietary
interest
test
set
forth
by
this
test
in
minnesota
tea
and
john
a.
nelson
when
it
sought
to
compare
the
equity
interest
which
the
paulsens
received
with
the
equity
interest
which
they
exchanged
for
their
interest
in
citizens
federal.
this
court
is
certainly
no
stranger
to
the
legal
character
of
share
accounts
in
a
mutual
savings
and
loan
association.
in
1967
in
tcherepnin
v.
knight,
the
issue
was
whether
the
owner
of
withdrawable
share
accounts
in
a
savings
and
loan
association
could
bring
an
action
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934,
a
so-called
10(b)(5)
action.
there,
the
court
of
appeals,
like
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
court,
had
found
that
the
relationships
of
the
owner
of
the
share
accounts
was
more
like
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
than
that
of
a
stockholder.
this
court,
however,
reversed
that
holding
and
said
that
forms
should
be
disregarded
in
substance...
for
substance,
and
emphasis
should
be
placed
on
economic
reality.
it
noted
that
in
a
mutual
savings
and
loan
association,
the
petitioners,
the
investors
in
the
association
were
engaged
in
a
common
enterprise:
that
of
lending
money.
and
they
relied
on
the
skill
and
efforts
of
the
management
for
return
on
their
investment:
for
it
there
are
no
earnings
and
profits
in
the
savings
and
loan
association,
there
can
be
no
dividends
paid.
the
court
found
in
reaching
that...
in
making
its
determination
that
the
following
factors
were
present,
and
these
factors
are
present
in
this
case.
the
share
accounts
carry
with
them
a
right
to
vote.
the
shares
represented
all
of
the
equity
of
the
association.
the
right
to
withdraw
as
a
shareholder
was
subject
to
certain
conditions,
and
the
application
to
withdraw
did
not
automatically
make
the
withdrawing
shareholder
a
creditor
of
the
association.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
yes.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
the
rights
which
are
given
to
the
holder
of
the
certificate
in
this
particular
case
are
exactly
the
same
as
those
on
the
passbook
accounts.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
when
the
share
account
holder
withdraws
the
money
from
the
association...
in
other
words,
takes
out
his
investment...
the
he
must
pay
the
tax.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
well,
i
think
that
particularly
in
these
types
of
mergers,
your
honor,
usually
these
accounts
are
segregated,
and
of
course,
since
it
is
a
reorganization,
the
organizations
must
file
the
necessary
information
with
the
commissioner
under
the
regulations
under
section
368
that
would
tell
that
there
has
been
a
reorganization.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
i
don't
believe
that
that
really
is
an
administrative
problem,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
are
certainly
ways
to
enforce
that,
and
it
is
certainly
no
more
difficult
than
a
share
of
stock
where
one
must
keep
track
of
his
basis
in
that
stock,
and
the
stock
might
split,
or
there
are
going
to
be
stock
dividends,
all
of
which
affect
the
basis,
and
when
that
stock
is
ultimately
sold,
the
gain
reported.
it
is
a
self-assessment
system,
and--
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
--i
think,
your
honor,
as
a
practical
matter
certainly
the
mergers
that
we
have
been
involved
with
when
the
decision
has
been
made
to
withdraw
the
accounts
by
the
parties
involved,
the
tax
has
always
been
paid,
and
in
particularly
in
these
types
of
situations
where
these
accounts
are
segregated
and
marked
as
exchange
accounts.
they
are
not
the
normal
type
accounts
in--
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
--well,
remember
that
in
these
reorganizations,
justice
white,
first
those
accounts
could
not
be
withdrawn
for
one
year.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
and
so
they
were
segregated
in
that
manner
so
that--
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
--that
is
correct.
he
could
go
in
and--
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
--yes.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
i
think
the
basis
would
be
allocated
over
the
full
amount
in
each
portion
of--
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
well,
i
think--
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
--i
think
from
a
practical
standpoint,
your
honor,
that
if
he
wanted
to
put
any
additional
money
into
a
passbook
savings
account,
he
would
have
to
open
a
new
account
so
that
this
could
be
kept
segregated.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
oh,
i
think...
i'm
sure
the
commissioner
has
the
authority
to
issue
regulations
that
would
cover
this
situation,
and
there
would
be
no
loss
to
the
fisc.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
basis
in
cash,
your
honor,
and...
and
i
think
that
what
a
passbook
account
holder
has
is
an
interest
in
that
savings
and
loan
association.
it
is
not
the
equivalent
of
cash,
and
you
can't
take
it
out
and
buy
a
television
set
with
it.
he
has
invested
his
money
in
that
mutual
association,
and
if
he
wants
to
get
out,
he
has
to
go
down
and
withdraw
from
that
association
and
give
up
rights
connected
with...
it
is
not
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
such
as
with
a
bank.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
well,
his
rights
go
down
as
he
withdraws
your
$100...
the
rights
that
he
has
are
to
participate
in
the
earnings
of
the...
of
the
association,
so
that
if
he
has
$100,
his
rights
are
less
than
if
he
has
$1,000.
so
that
as
he
withdraws,
his
rights
go
down
proportionally
just
as
with
all
the
other
share
account
holders
in
the
association,
relative
rights
in
the
association.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
oh,
yes,
they
do.
i...
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
at
least
in
the
litigated
cases
it
shows
that
mutual
associations
do
have
a
residual
value.
even
the
respondent's
own
regulations
or
published
rulings
show
that
in
certain
situations--
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
--probably
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
well,
i
think
that
perhaps
in
certain
circumstances
that
does
exist,
and
there
is
a
much
litigated
case,
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
v.
elliot
which
involved
a
long
peach
savings
and
loan
association,
and
when
it
was
going
to
liquidate
and
there
was
a
substantial
surplus,
there
was
a
sudden
influx
of
large
depositors.
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
felt
that
the
board
of
directors
of
the
company
was
not
stepping
in
fast
enough.
it
came
in
and
prohibited
those
large
depositors
from
sharing
in
the
proceeds
upon
the
liquidation,
although
it
actually
subsequently
changed
to
a...
a
merger
with
a
guaranteed
stock
type
association.
but
they
were
not
allowed...
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
cut
off
as
a
certain
date
the
right
to
share
in
that...
in
the
residual
assets
of
the
association
when
it
was
subsequently
merged
into
a
stock-type
association
to
prevent,
in
effect,
insider
training,
which
is
what
happened
in
the
elliot
case.
thus,
in...
in
tcherepnin,
even
without
the
guidance
of
a
definition
in
the
securities
and
exchange
act
such
as
there
is
in
the
internal
revenue
code
that
the
shares
do
represent
stock,
this
court
held
that
the
share
account
holder
could
bring
an
action
under
10(b)(5)
and
that
such
shares
were
stock.
the
respondent
seeks
to
characterize,
and
the
ninth
circuit
unfortunately
agreed,
that
the
petitioners'
relationship
to
citizens
is
that
of
a
depositor
in
a
bank.
however,
as
recently
as
1982
this
court
rejected
by
that
analogy
in
marine
bank
v.
weaver,
and
in
that
case
a
depositor
in
a
bank
sought
protection
under
section
10(b)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934,
and
cited
as
precedent
tcherepnin.
in
that
case
this
court
pointed
out
that
tcherepnin
was
a
different
situation.
there,
there
was
a
mutual
savings
and
loan
association,
and
the
share
accounts
carried
with
it
the
right
to
dividends
based
on
profit,
voting
rights,
and
it
was
a
stock
situation,
not
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
such
as
with
a
bank.
other
courts
have
also
looked
at
the
relationship
of
a
stock
or
a
share
account
holder
in
a
savings
and
loan
association.
in
wisconsin
bankers,
decided
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
1961,
an
action
was
brought
by
an
association
of
bankers
who
claimed
that
savings
and
loan
associations
were
competing
unfairly
with
banks
because
they
allowed
the
share
account
holders
to
deposit
money
on
what
were
called
savings
accounts.
however,
the
court
said
that
they
were
more
concerned
with
the
legal
realities
and
not
the
appearances,
and
even
though
these
were
called
savings
accounts,
they
were
really
share
accounts
since
the
represented
the
capital
of
the
association,
and
therefore,
they
were
not
violating
or
competing
illegally
with
the
banks.
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
opinion
below
did
not
discuss
one
of
these
cases.
however...
and
dismissed
in
its
decision
the
right
to
vote
as
having
no
value.
it,
directly
contrary
to
the
decisions
and
the
discussion
relating
to
the
cases
in
tcherepnin,
it
said
that
the
dividend
payments
were
precisely
like
interest
and
not
distinguishable,
and
that
the
right
to
share
proportionally
in
the
residual
value
of
the
association
had
no
value.
we
believe
that
these
points
are
all...
the
ninth
circuit
was
mistaken
on
each
one
of
those
points.
the
ninth
circuit
also
misapplied
the
continuity
of
interest
test
in
the
decision
below.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
well,
it
has
a
value,
your
honor.
i
think
in
midwest
savings,
a
case
that
was
cited
which
involved
the
merger
of
two
mutual
savings
and
loan
associations,
in
order
to
equalize
the
value
a
4
percent
bonus
dividend
was
declared
by
one
of
the
associations
just
prior
to
the
merger.
in
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
case
versus
elliot
there
was
a
residual
value
which
was
recognized
where
the
insiders
tried
to
come
in
and
claim
a
portion
of
that
value.
russell,
in
his
volume
on
savings
and
loan
associations,
talks
about
there
being
numerous
liquidations
of
savings
and
loan
associations
at
or
above
par
during
the
thirty-year
period.
in
revenue
ruling
69649
cited
in
the
brief,
the
respondent
in
that
case...
it
was
the
merger
of
a
federal
mutual
savings
and
loan
association
into
a
stock-type
savings
and
loan
association...
and
in
that
ruling
the
share
account
holders
in
the
mutual
received
face
value
accounts
in
the
stock-type
association
and
then
received
guarantee
stock
for
the
residual
value
for
the
undistributed
profits
and
the
reserves.
so
there
is
a
value
there.
the
share
account
holders
own
that
value
and
share
proportionally
in
it
if
there
is
a
merger
or
liquidation.
the
ninth
circuit,
we
believe,
also
misapplied
the
continuity
of
interest
test
in
its
decision
below
when
it
looked
to
the
change
in
the
proprietary
interest
received
by
the
paulsens
in
the
reorganization
to
determine
whether
the
test
was
met.
in
its
opinion
the
court
stated
that
there
was
little
doubt
that
the
passbook
accounts
are
equity,
since
they
represent
the
entire
capital
structure
of
the
association.
however,
after
making
that
observation,
the
court
went
on
to
say,
"the
critical
question,
however,
is
whether
the
position
of
the
shareholder
in
the
reorganized
entity
has
really
changed.
"
"has
his
risk
increased
or
decreased?
"
"is
his
investment
more
or
less
liquid?
"
"this,
we
suggest,
is
not
the
test.
"
"the
only
inquiry
is
whether
a
proprietary
interest
was
received,
not
what
kind
of
a
proprietary
interest
was
received.
"
as
noted
by
this
court
in
minnesota
tea
and
john
a.
nelson,
the
relationship
to
the
assets
can
change,
but
so
long
as
there
is
a
proprietary
relationship
with
the
ongoing
corporation,
there
is
a
proprietary
interest
which
meets
the
test.
the
respondent,
we
believe,
is
also
making
the
same
incorrect
comparison
if
you
examine
his
published
revenue
rulings.
in
revenue
ruling
69-3,
which
involved
the
merger
of
two
mutual
savings
and
loan
associations,
the
respondent
ruled
that
it
was
a
tax-free
reorganization
under
section
368(a)(1)(a).
this
is
the
same
interest
that
the
petitioners
received
in
this
case.
if
that
ruling
is
right,
how
can
this
be
stock
for
one
purpose
and
not
for
another?
in
other
words,
the
position
of
the
respondent
right
now
is
that
if
there
is
a
mutual...
a
merger
of
a
mutual
association
into
a
mutual
association,
it
is
tax
free;
but
if
there
is
a
merger
of
a
stock
association,
such
as
in
this
case,
into
a
mutual
and
the
shareholders
of
the
stock
association
exchange
their
stock
for
the
only
equity
the
mutual
association
can
give
the
share
accounts,
it
is
not
tax
free.
we
think
this
is
inconsistent
and
wrong.
thus,
the
only
question
to
be
decided
is
whether
the
petitioners
continued
as
owners
of
the
reorganized
enterprise.
since
passbook
accounts
by
the
court's
own
concession
are
equity,
we
think
this
question
has
to
be
answered
in
the
affirmative.
i'd
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
thank
you.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
in
closing
that
the
test
of
the
proprietary
interest
received
should
not
be
how
risky
it
is.
it
is
whether
it
is
a
proprietary
interest
that
should
control.
and
once
one
gets
down...
started
down
the
line
of
whether
there
is
a
risk,
then
how
do
you
take
into
account
preferred
stock,
how
do
you
value
the
equity
interest,
how
can
you
separate
the
equity
interests
from
the
other
interests
that
one
has?
i
think
it's
a
dangerous
way
to
go,
and
i...
i
would
urge
this
court
that
if
we
are
going
to
depart
from
the
line
of
cases
that
have
held
what
the
rights
and
obligations
are
of
a
share
account
owner
in
a
savings
and
loan
association,
it
is
something
that
should
be
addressed
to
congress.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
i
do
not
believe
there
is
anything
in
the
record,
justice
o'connor.
my
understanding
is
that
they
are
separate;
they
could
be
transferred
from
a
guarantee
stock
type
association.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
yes.
mr.
william
r.
nicholas
thank
you,
your
honor.
