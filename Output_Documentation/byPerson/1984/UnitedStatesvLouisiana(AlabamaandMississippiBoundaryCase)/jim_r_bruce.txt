mr.
jim
r.
bruce
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
states
take
the
position
that
the
master's
findings
and
conclusions
are
eminently
well
founded.
they
further
submit
that
his
reasoning
is
further
reinforced
by
certain
bases
which
the
states
have
submitted
in
the
way
of
exceptions
merely
to
support
the
master's
ultimate
finding.
in
the
brief
time
allotted
to
me
i
will
address
the
question
of
the
master's
finding
as
to
mississippi
sound
as
inland
waters
under
article
7
of
the
geneva
convention.
mr.
cohen
will
address
the
treatment
of
mississippi
sound
as
inland
waters.
while
we've
separated
these
arguments
for
the
purpose
of
presentation,
we
certainly
invite
the
court's
questions
as
to
either
issue
at
any
time.
i
think
the
most
interesting
thing
that
tends
to
jump
out
at
one
as
you
look
at
the
map
which
we
have
submitted
for
the
purpose
of
oral
argument
are
the
four
patches
of
high
seas
within
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
alabama.
the
united
states
takes
the
position
in
this
case
and
a
similar
position
in
the
long
island
case
that
all
it's
doing
is
applying
the
convention,
and
that
when
the
convention
is
properly
applied,
at
least
in
the
mississippi
sound,
enclaves
of
high
seas...
in
some
instances
no
acre
than
six
feet
deep...
necessarily
occur.
the
states
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
selective
application
of
the
convention.
nowhere
but
in
a
domestic
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
a
state
would
enclaves
in
fact
appear.
were
a
foreign
nation
claiming
mississippi
sound
or
an
area
such
as
that,
the
question
of
enclaves
would
never
arise.
it
has
no
international
significance
in
that
sense.
a
foreign
nation
could
easily
validate
its
claim
to
those
enclaves
and
to
the
entire
sound
by
proper
application
of
other
provisions
of
the
convention.
the
witnesses
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
pointed
out
that
the
government's
position
did
not
further
freedom
of
the
high
seas.
they
further
pointed
out
that
it
didn't
serve
an
important
policy
consideration,
and
that
the
inclusion
of
mississippi
sounds
as
internal
waters
of
the
state
of
mississippi
would
not
in
fact
extend
the
traditional
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
it
was
also
conceded
that
it
would
not
jeopardize
the
united
states'
position
so
far
as
international
relations
in
objecting
to...
objecting
to
excessive
claims
by
foreign
nations.
the
questions
i
think
that
relate
to
article
7
i
think
are
most
important,
and
i
would
like
to
correct
the
statement
that's
been
made
by
the
solicitor's
office,
especially
with
regard
to
caillou
pay.
he
suggested
that
caillou
bay
involved
a
very
similar
situation;
that
is,
a
situation
where
the
islands
lying
in
the
mouth
of
a
pre-existing
bay.
i
believe
reference
to
a
map
of
this
area
will
indicate
that
not
to
be
the
situation.
neither
of
the
two
islands
which
would
have
been
used
as
headlands
for
the
bay
in
fact
lie
at
the
mouth
of
the
bay
to
the
east.
i'm
referring
to
the
attachment
to
mississippi...
to
alabama's
reply
brief,
attachment
no.
7.
the
two
large
islands
which
jut
out
from
the
louisiana
coast
at
approximately
a
45
degree
angle
do
not
appear
in
the
least
to
be
a
part
of
a
pre-existing
juridical
bay.
i
believe
attachment
no.
8
will
show
the
western
extremity
or
the
eastern
extremity
of
that
particular
area.
i've
looked
at
these
maps,
and
i
don't
see
the
island
the
united
states
is
referring
to.
i
might
also
note
the
court
did
raise
a
question
a
little
bit
earlier
when
the
united
states
changed
its
position.
the
master,
of
course,
found
that
the
position
was
not
announced
until
1971,
and
of
course,
as
late
as
1979
in
its
litigation
with
louisiana,
the
united
states
still
contended
that
mississippi
sound
was
internal
waters.
and
i
would
refer
to
page
39
of
our
brief
in
which
we
reproduced
that
concession.
they
were
again
relying
on
louisiana
v.
mississippi.
at
another
point
in
their
brief
they
conceded
that
mississippi
sound
was
different
from
the
islands
along
the
louisiana
coast.
they
said
that
the
islands
there
were
islands
in
the
open
sea...
a
situation
which
was
quite
different
from
mississippi
sound,
with
the
clear
implication
being
mississippi
sound
constituted
islands
in
the
mouth
of
the
bay.
i
think
it's
interesting
that
a
former
geographer
for
the
state
department,
mr.
percy,
back
in
1959,
writing
just
about
the
time
that
the
geneva
convention
was
being
considered
by
other
nations,
shortly
before
its
ratification
by
the
united
states,
discussed
the
terms
of
the
convention,
and
he
talked
about
islands
in
the
mouth
of
a
bay.
when
he
did,
he
pointed
to
mississippi
sound,
which
he
described
mississippi
sound
as
being
one
of
the
most
impressive
dimensions
involving
juridical
bays
is
mississippi
sound,
partially
closed
off
by
a
series
of
sandy
islands.
the
former
geographer
at
least
read
the
convention
to
constitute
a
juridical
bay.
of
course,
mississippi
sound
has
had
various
names
in
its
history.
at
one
time
it
was
called
pascagoula
bay,
pascagcula
sound.
as
of
about
1940...
1845,
it
was
termed
mississippi
sound
as
a
result
of
a
government
survey
of
the
area.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
so
far
as...
so
far
as
biloxi,
the
channel
there
is
not
sufficiently
deep
to
accommodate
anything
but
pleasurecraft.
so
far
as
the
channels
between
pascagoula
and
gulfport,
the
water
there...
the
harbormaster
testified
and
pointed
out
it
was
the
most
shallowest
port,
gulfport,
shallowest
port
on
the
gulf
coast.
i
believe
the
depth...
my
recollection
is
it's
very
shallow.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
your
honor,
with
regard
to
gulfport,
the
ships
would
come
in
a
dredged
channel
made
for
that
purpose
for
entering
the
harbor
works
at
gulfport.
the
channel
extends
from
gulfport
between
cat
island
and
ship
island.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
way
the
ships
come
in,
they
come
in
the
channel.
once
they
get
in,
there's
not
room
enough
to
turn
around,
and
they
have
a
turntable
that
the
ship
is
turned
around
on
the
turntable
and
goes
out
the
same
way
it
comes
in.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
your
honor,
the
channel
there
would
be
between
petit
bois
island
and
horn
island.
again,
it
goes
straight
in
and
straight
out
in
very
much
the
same
way.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
your
honor,
it
would
have
to.
as
the
master
found,
the
water
there
is
extremely
shallow.
it's
only
no
more
than
six
feet
deed
except
for
the
channel,
project
channel
of...
by
the
way,
it's
the
intracoastal
waterway...
is
only
twelve
feet
deep.
it's
not
sufficiently
deep
to
accommodate
international
shipping.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
your
honor,
the
channels
vary
from
time
to
time,
and
i
can't
give
you
a
specific
idea.
the...
the
largest
area
typically,
historically,
the
tip
of
ship
island
where
the
port
was
built
provided
a
small
harbor
for
ships
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries.
the
water
there
i
believe
reached
a
maximum
depth
of
about
17
feet.
so
that
is
the
deepest
area
that
i
know
of
in
the
sound.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
rather
interesting
from
a
historical
point
of
view
when
the
d'aiberville
and
the
early
explorers
were
sailing
in
that
area
they
would
anchor
outside
the
islands
and
send
small
boats
in
because
of
the
shallowness
of
the
water.
at
one
point
i
believe
d'aiberville
or
somebody
was
able
to
get
a
boat
into
ocean
springs,
mississippi,
but
they
had
to
wait
a
considerable
time
before
they
could
get
the
boat
out
or
almost
a
change
of
seasons.
it
was
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
did.
the
testimony
in
the
record
indicates
that
there
were
launches,
flatbottom
boats
and
so
on
that
navigate
this
area.
the
traffic
you
have
in
there
is
not
international
traffic
lengthwise
of
the
sound.
it
is
purely
domestic,
the
same
kind
of
traffic,
i
suppose,
that
the
court
noticed
in
the
anglo-norwegian
fisheries
case.
it
was
basically
used
by
local
people.
it
was
basically
domestic
traffic.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
are
two
reasons
why
we
support
that.
number
one,
we
think
he
was
eminently
correct
so
far
as
his
application
of
the
standards
which
this
court
set
forth
in
the
louisiana
case.
and
by
the
way,
a
review
of
those
standards
should
go
beyond
just
the
court
decision
in
that
case.
it
should
include
louisiana
v.
mississippi,
and
it
should
also
include
the
international
court's
finding
that
the
fringe
of
islands
along
the
norwegian
coast
constitute
an
extension
of
that
mainland.
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
islands--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--well,
your
honor,
one
of
the
things
they
pointed
out--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--your
honor,
that
is
part
of
it.
in
fact,
the
court
said
there
that
there
are
numerous
bays,
straits,
arms
of
the
sea
and
so
on,
and
these
provide
internal
navigation.
that
was
one
of
the
factors
that
was
taken
into
consideration.
the
depth
of
water
was
another;
the
fact
that
from...
from
the
sea
they
appeared
to
be
a
whole
with
the
mainland.
in
fact,
the
same
factors
appear
in
both
this
court's
decision
in
'69
and
the...
in
the
fisheries
case.
in
the
court's
directions
here,
the
guidance
for
the
masters
are
certainly
much
more
replete
and
leave
less
to
the
imagination
of
the
master.
i
might
point
out
that
there
there
were
islands
much,
much
larger
than
dauphin
island
and
at
considerably
greater
distances
from
the
mainland
shore.
so
far
as
the
master's
consideration
as
to
the
second
point...
and
that
is,
treatment
of
islands...
or
treatment
of
inland
waters
as
mainland...
we
think
the
master
did
nothing
more
there
than
state
the
obvious.
the
question
perhaps
might
be--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--well,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--there
is
some
indication.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
well,
your
honor,
so
far
as--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--not
exactly.
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor,
insofar
as
that
particular--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--well,
i
think
there
is
something
very
relevant,
and
that
is
this
court's
consideration
of
article
11
in
the
1969
louisiana
decision.
the
question
there
was
one
of
straight
baselines,
which
i
consider
to
be
the
point
here.
it's
not
a
question
so
much
of
whether
inland
waters
may
be
mainland,
but
it's
a
question
of
how
you
treat
a
baseline
under
article
7
and
under
the
geneva
convention.
we
contend
that
a
baseline
is
a
part
of
the
coast,
and
therefore,
if
a
baseline
lies
along
an
island,
it
may,
too,
be
part
of
the
coast
within
the
meaning
of
the
convention.
that's
all
this
court
has
required.
there
is
a
baseline
drawn
from
mobile
point
to
dauphin
island,
from
dauphin
island
to
the
mainland.
dauphin
island
lies
in
the
mouth
of
mobile
bay;
therefore,
it
is
a
part
of--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--the
baseline
would
go
from
mobile
point
to
the
east
end
of
dauphin
island.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
well,
your
honor,
the
dauphin
island
would
be
an
integral
part
of
the
mainland
or
a
part
of
the
baseline.
the
baseline
would
go
around
dauphin
island
and
of
course
would
pick
up
on
the
other
side
and
go
from
the
northern
tip
of
dauphin
island
to
cedar
point.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
2.68
miles,
your
honor.
the
distance
between
cedar
point
and
dauphin
island
to
the
south
is
less
than
1.6
miles.
i
think
that
is
an
important
factor
to
consider,
and
that
is,
the
distance
between
the
island
and
the
size
of
the
island.
while
1.6
miles,
as
the
master
noted,
might
have
been
excessive
for
a
mud
lump
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi,
we
think
for
an
island
14.75
miles
long
and
which
encloses
waters
to
the
north
and
meets
the
other
criteria,
certainly
constitutes
an
extension
of
the
mainland.
so
far
as
the
question
about
inland
waters
as
being
mainland,
i
think
a
very
good
instance
might
be
the
situation
with
a
river.
there's
no
doubt
but
what
a
river
is
a
part
of
the
mainland.
although
it
is
water,
it
is
mainland.
and
the
line
joining
the
entrances
to
a
river
is
certainly
nonetheless
mainland.
in
fact,
it's
treated
the
same
way
for
a
delimitation
of
territorial
seas
is
mainland.
just
as
that
is
the
case
there,
we
think
that
the
closing
line
for
a
bay,
which
is
also
internal
waters,
serves
to...
the
same
as
mainland,
and
an
island
which
adjoins
a
closing
line
would
also
be
treated
as
mainland
for
purposes
of
applying
article
7.
and
the
real
question
here
is
not
whether
land
is
water.
that's
never
been
in
dispute.
the
question
is
whether
the
convention
would
recognize
the
use
of
an
island
to
help
form
a
bay,
and
it
does
so
only
in
a
very
limited
situation...
in
a
situation
which
this
court
and
the
international
court
of
justice
have
both
said
can
only
happen
where
the
waters
between
are
so
closely
related
to
the
mainland
as
to
be
justly
treated
as
internal
waters.
we
think
that's
the
only
instance
where
that
may
happen.
