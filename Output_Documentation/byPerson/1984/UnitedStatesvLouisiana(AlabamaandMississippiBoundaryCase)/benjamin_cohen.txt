mr.
benjamin
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
special
master
armstrong
found
that
mississippi
sound
was
a
historic
bay.
he
based
his
conclusion
on
a
systematic
analysis
of
the
facts,
guided
by
the
legal
principles
laid
down
by
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
cohen
whether
under
juridical
idea?
no,
sir,
it
doesn't.
i
think
it
would
be
inland
waters
under
either
situation.
the
result
of
the
master's
recommendation
we
believe
for
several
reasons
is
factually
logical.
the
united
states
international
law
expert
testified
that
a
historic
claim
to
mississippi
sound
would
be
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
the
sound
is
totally
enclosed
from
the
open
sea.
the
borders
of
the
mississippi
sound
on
the
north
are
land,
on
the
east
and
west
they're
inland
water,
and
on
the
south
it's
a
total
three-mile
belt
of
territorial
waters.
second,
this
geographical
configuration
is
a
cul-de-sac.
as
mr.
bruce
explained,
there's
no
reason
for
international
shipping
to
enter
mississippi
sound
other
than
to
go
to
an
inland
port.
it
is
not
a
route
of
passage
between
areas
of
high
seas,
and
it
is
so
shallow
as
not
to
be
readily
navigable
for
ocean-going
vessels.
mr.
benjamin
cohen
first,
as
you
correctly
pointed
out
earlier,
this
court's
opinion
in
louisiana
v.
mississippi,
1905,
found
that
mississippi
sound
was
internal
waters.
mr.
benjamin
cohen
once...
the
master
looked
at
pre-admission
history
and
post-admission
history.
he
found
that
the
united
states
exercised
authority
over
mississippi
sound
beginning
shortly
after
the
united
states
acquired
this
territory
from
france
in
1905
the
louisiana
purchase.
in
1804
the
united
states
congress
annexed
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
sound
into
a
customs
district.
from
that
time
forward
congress
considered
those
waters
as
internal
waters
and
proposed
in
about
1817
the
intracoastal
waterway
between
mobile
and
new
orleans.
those
incidents
are
consistent
with
the
background
reasons
why
nations
claim
historic
bays.
it's
natural
for
a
nation
to
lay
claim
to
an
area
that
is
adjacent
to
its
coast
that
is
important
for
reason
of
economy
or
vital
reasons
of
security.
congress
then
established
that
intracoastal
waterway,
which
is
the
gulf
intracoastal
waterway
today.
considering
that
congressional
activity,
which
continued
from
about
1803
until
the
turn
of
the
century,
and
then
this
court
decided
the
louisiana
v.
mississippi
case
in
1905.
and
from
that
time
i
don't
believe
there
has
been
any...
any
question
about
the
inland
water
status
of
the
mississippi
sound.
as
it
was
pointed
out
earlier,
the
solicitor
general,
based
on
louisiana
v.
mississippi,
believed
that
mississippi
sound
was
inland
waters.
i
believe
the...
the
master
found
in
this
case
that
the
united
states
had
exercised
jurisdiction
over
mississippi
sound,
and
that
that
exercise
had
been
continuous,
and
that
foreign
nations
had
acquiesced
in
that
exercise,
and
that
they
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
claim
being
made.
the
two
issues
in
this
case
that
go
to
the
heart
of
the
dispute
between
the
states
and
the
united
states
is
whether
there
was
a
claim
to
inland
waters
made
and
whether
nations
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known
that
that
claim
had
been
made.
all
of
these
relate
directly
to
the
common
sense
recommendations
of
the
master's
and
the
geographical
configuration
of
the
sound.
i'd
like
to
discuss
in
a
little
bit
more
detail
the
louisiana
v.
mississippi
opinion,
the
1905
opinion
of
this
court.
as
an
opinion
of
this
court
of
course
it
is
notice
to
the
world,
notice
to
foreign
nations
of
the
claim
made.
as
was
pointed
out,
in
order
to
decide
that
case,
the
court
had
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
thalweg.
the
doctrine
of
thalweg
only
applies
in
inland
waters.
the
issue
in
that
case
was
to
decide
whether
the
boundary
line
between
louisiana
and
mississippi
would
lie
in
a
deepwater
sailing
channel
between
the
states.
the
court
applied
thalweg
and
found
that
it
did.
in
so
doing,
the
court
extended
a
lateral
state
boundary
over
lake
borgne
and
over
mississippi
sound
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
which
it
found
to
lie
south
of
the
barrier
islands.
and,
in
essence,
it
acknowledged
and
recognized
the
united
states
exercise
of
authority
over
mississippi
sound.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
master,
believing
that
this
court
found
that
mississippi
sound
was
inland
waters,
also
believed
that
congressional
actions
from
1803
until
the
turn
of
the
century
also
believed
that
the
waters
were
inland
waters.
the
third
basis
of
the
master's
opinion
was
that
the
united
states
had
had
a
consistent
policy
in
the
international
community
to
enclose
waters
of
the
type
as
mississippi
sound
as
inland
waters.
this
the
master
referred
to
commonly
as
the
ten-mile
rule,
which
is
basically
a
rule
that
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
which
are
straits
or
sound
which
lead
to
other
bodies
of
inland
water,
which
are
no
more
than
ten
miles
wide,
should
be
dealt
with
and
enclosed
as
inland
water.
the
policy
that
created
this
situation
was
established
in
approximately
1903,
which
is
approximately
the
same
time
as
this
court
decided
louisiana
v.
mississippi.
that
in
a
sense
continues
the
united
states
exercise
of
authority
from
1903
up
until
that
policy
was
dropped
in
approximately
1961
with
the
adoption
of
the
geneva
convention.
the
master's
analysis
of
this
rule
was
quite
similar
to
the
international
court
of
justice
analysis
of
a
similar
rule
in
the
anglo-norwegian
fisheries
case.
in
that
case
there
were
two
issues:
whether
the
norwegian
government's
standard
of
delimitation
of
territorial
waters
was
correct
under
international
law.
the
court
found
that
it
was,
but
once
finding
that,
they
turned
to
the
question
of
whether
the
waters
behind
that
line
could
be
treated
historically
as
inland
waters.
in
our
situation
this
is
basically
what
the
master
did
concerning
the
united
states
policy.
both
the
master
and
the
international
court
of
justice
found
that
there
was
a
general
policy
to
delimit
inland
waters
and
that
these
policies
had
been
continuous,
and
that
foreign
nations
were
well
aware
of
those
policies.
in
fact,
in
both
situations...
in
the
norway
situation
there
was
a
request
from
france
asking
what
was
your
policy
in
delimiting
waters.
in
the
united
states
situation
there
was
a
request
from
norway
asking
what
is
your
policy.
so
without
question,
foreign
nations
were
well
aware
of
both
policies.
mr.
benjamin
cohen
i
think
it
was
in
1949,
justice
rehnquist.
in
addition
to
that,
both
the
master
and
the
international
court
of
justice
relied
on
an
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
country,
the
respective
country.
in
norway
it
was
the
st.
juste
case,
and
of
course
in
this
situation
it's
the
louisiana
v.
mississippi
case.
both
found
that
the
subject
waters...
that
the
dispute
of
the
subject
waters
were
historic
inland
waters.
so
we
submit
that
the
master's
recommendation
in
this
case
is,
above
all,
logical.
we
believe
it
is
factually
and
legally
correct.
we
believe
that
the
recommendations
should
be
accepted,
and
the
master's
analysis
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that's
the
end
of
my
presentation.
mr.
benjamin
cohen
thank
you.
