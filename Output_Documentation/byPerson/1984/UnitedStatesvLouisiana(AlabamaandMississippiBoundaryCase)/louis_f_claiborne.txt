mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
companion
case
we
are
concerned
with
a
body
of
water
commonly
labeled
the
mississippi
sound.
it's
a
long,
elongated,
sausage-like
strip
of
water
off
the
coast
of
mississippi
and
alabama.
it
is
some
80
miles
long
and
at
most
10
miles
wide.
it's
perhaps
most
clearly
illustrated
in
the
map...
the
first
of
the
maps
at
the
back
of
our
exceptions,
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
comparable
map
which
has
been
distributed,
i
think,
at
the
bench
on
behalf
of
mississippi
and
alabama.
but
referring
to
our
chart
1,
the
court
will
see
that
it's
defined,
mississippi
sound,
at
the
east
by
mobile
bay,
a
discrete,
separate
body
of
water,
and
at
the
west
by
something
called
lake
borgne.
and
when
i
say
80
miles
long,
i
do
not
include
either
lake
borgne
or
mobile
bay.
now,
referring
to
the
second
of
our
charts
to
indicate
what
is
disputed
and
what
is
not
disputed,
we
of
course
concede
that
mobile
bay
at
the
east
is
an
inland
water
of
alabama,
a
juridical
bay,
and
at
the
west
lake
borgne
and
that
portion
of
the
mississippi
sound
which
is
hashed,
which
goes
from
isle
au
pitre
to
the
north
towards
one
of
the
headlands
of
st.
louis
bay.
the
portion
to
the
west
of
that
is
likewise
inland
water.
what
is
in
controversy,
therefore,
is
that
long,
thin
strip
in
between,
defined
by
those
two
inland
bodies
of
water
at
the
east
and
west
and
by
what
are
called
the
barrier
islands
at
the
south;
that
is,
cat
island,
ship
island,
horn
island,
petit
bois
island,
and
dauphin.
now,
the
claim
was
that
this
area
constitutes
a
juridical
bay
under
article
7
of
the
international
convention
and,
independently,
alternatively,
that
it
is
historic
inland
water.
the
special
master
appointed
by
this
court
concluded
that
it
was
enclosed.
we
challenge
each
of
those
conclusions.
now,
straight
away
i
should
say
that
the
result
in
this
case
may
seem
perfectly
sensible,
perfectly
reasonable,
because
that
area
looks
somewhat
enclosed,
sheltered
by
those
islands.
one
tight
say
why
shouldn't
that
be
treated
as
inland
water?
the
answer
is
that
as
a
matter
of
international
law
it
could
indeed
be
treated
as
inland
water.
it
is
a
textbook
example
of
an
instance
where
straight
baselines
under
article
4
of
the
convention
would
be
appropriately
drawn.
but
as
i
said
in
the
previous
case,
this
court
quite
emphatically
twice,
in
the
california
case
and
in
the
louisiana
case,
held
that
the
question
whether
to
invoke
that
straight
baseline
way
of
enclosing
inland
waters
is
one
to
be
made
by
the
united
states.
it
is
not
reviewable
by
this
court,
and
in
this,
as
in
all
other
instances,
the
united
states,
for
good
or
bad
reasons,
has
determined
not
to
invoke
that
way
of
enclosing
inland
water.
and
that
decision
cannot
be
got
round,
as
is
sought
to
be
done
here,
by
creating
a
bay
out
of
islands...
a
thing
which
this
court
has
firmly
said
may
not
be
done.
now,
recognizing
that,
the
master
looked
to
see
whether
he
could
find
a
bay
that
would
satisfy
the
rules
of
the
convention.
first,
he
addressed
the
question
of
juridical
bay.
now,
when
you
look
at
this
area,
it
doesn't
look
like
a
bay.
it's
too
long
and
too
thin,
and
normally
wouldn't
satisfy
any
of
the
tests.
however,
if
one
is
willing
to
indulge
in
contrivances,
one
can
eke
out
a
bay
because
one
can
draw
an
opposing
line
anchored
on
the
islands,
thereby
the
distance,
the
water
distance,
both
for
the
purpose
of
the
24-mile
line
and
for
the
purpose
of
the
semi-circle
test...
both
things
permissible
under
the
convention.
but
one
still--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--the
width
of
the
mississippi
sound--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--it...
the
distance
between
isle
au
pitre,
which
is
viewed
as
part
of
the
mainland,
and
cedar
point
by
going
via
dauphin
island
is
less
than
24
miles,
just
under
24
miles.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
you
don't
count
the
islands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
which
you're
not
supposed
to
if
that's
a
proper
way
of
doing
it.
on
the
other
hand,
the
distance
between
isle
at
pitre
and
mobile
point
to
the
east
is
more
than
24
miles,
just
a
little
bit
more.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
just
over
24
miles,
which
is
why
one
has
to
talk
about
dauphin
island,
which
is
the
key
to
the
juridical
bay
argument.
it
is,
the
master
himself
concluded,
that
unless
dauphin
island
could
be
assimilated
to
the
mainland,
there
is
no
juridical
bay
here,
except,
of
course,
mobile
bay
and
a
portion
of
lake
borgne
to
the
west
and
the
little
discrete
bays
which
we've
indicated
at
the
north.
and
so
he
concentrated
his
mind
on
the
question:
can
dauphin
island
properly
be
viewed
as
an
extension
of
the
mainland?
once
again,
the
question
of
distance,
use
of
the
intervening
waters,
and
alignment
of
that
island
with
the
mainland
were
considered;
but
once
again,
as
it
seems
to
us
and
as
we
detail
in
our
brief,
those
tests
simply
do
not
justify
dauphin
island
as
an
extension
of
the
mainland.
and
indeed,
the
master
himself
so
concluded.
and
so,
finding
that
applying
the
tests
of
the
louisiana
case
to
dauphin
island
would
not
satisfy
the
test
here,
would
not
satisfy
dauphin
island
here,
the
master
invoked
what
is
a
truly
novel
proposition,
which
is
that
when
an
island
is
separated
from
the
mainland
by
inland
water
as
opposed
to
territorial
water
or
high
seas,
then
that
intervening
water
may
be
treated
as
land,
and
of
course,
the
island
becomes
a
peninsula...
a
remarkably
neat,
self-serving
result,
but
one
which
leads
to
quite
ridiculous
results
if
carried
out
too
far,
as
this
very
same
master
had
himself
recognized
ten
years
previously
when
writing
his
report
in
the
louisiana
case,
because
louisiana
had
made
precisely
this
argument
and
had
been
rejected
by
him
and
by
the
court.
it
is
of
course
true
that
inland
water
is
in
some
sense
assimilated
to
the
land;
that
is
to
say,
the
sovereignty
of
the
coastal
state
of
is
fully
applicable
to
its
internal
or
inland
waters,
but
it
hardly
follows
that
that
equality
of
jurisdiction
turns
water
into
land.
and
indeed,
article
7
of
the
convention
in
every
portion
of
it
distinguishes
between
land
and
water.
it
measures
water
gaps
as
opposed
to
the
land
gaps
in
a
bay,
all
of
which
are
inland
waters.
it
treats
those
gaps
differently
both
for
the
semi-circle
test
and
for
the
24-mile
rule,
thereby
very
clearly
distinguishing
and
not
confusing
land
and
water.
and
yet,
it's
quite
clear
that
that
is
the
prime,
basic
reason
why
the
master
concluded
that
what
was
under
the
louisiana
case
an
island
too
far
removed
from
land
should
nevertheless
be
treated
as
an
extension
of
it.
we
point
out
that
this
argument
had
been
rejected
by
him
in
one
place
and,
most
relevantly,
in
the
case
of
the
isle
dernieres
in
louisiana
where
formation,
an
arm
of
a
putative
bay
called
caillou
bay
was
sought
to
be
constructed
on
that
same
theory;
that
at
the
eastern
end
those
islands
touched
inland
water
and
therefore
were
connected
to
land
by
those
inland
waters.
and
indeed,
in
this
case
for
reasons
which
i
do
not
fully
appreciate,
one
of
the
state
briefs
has
reproduced
that
very
submission
by
louisiana
rejected
by
the
master
and
rejected
by
this
court.
it's
perhaps
well
to
indicate
precisely
what
alabama
was...
and
mississippi
were
doing
here.
in
the
reply
brief
of
alabama,
which
is
the
thickest
volume
in
the
pile,
there
are
a
number
of
maps
at
the
back,
and
the
first
one
indicates
how
alabama
treats
mobile
bay
as
connecting
dauphin
island
to
the
mainland.
there
it's
simply
hatched.
and
in
the
next
one
we
find
that
alabama...
the
mobile
bay
is
truly
assimilated
to--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--the...
and,
of
course,
dauphin
island
then
looks
like
an
extension
of
the
mainland.
now,
that
is
precisely
what
louisiana
has
sought
to
do,
as
attachment
6
to
this
brief
illustrates.
there's
caillou
bay
as...
this
is
an
exhibit
louisiana
used...
and
the
part
that
is
hashed
is
mostly
water...
lake
pelto
and
other
water
bodies,
but
inland
water
bodies,
and
therefore,
said
louisiana,
assimilated
land.
it
seems
to
us,
therefore,
that
this
argument,
which
has
no
validity
independently,
has
been
addressed
by
this
master
and
by,
more
relevantly,
by
this
court
and
rejected,
and
that
accordingly,
it
is
not
a
viable
method
for
assimilating
islands
to
land.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
turn
to
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
let
me
say
straight
away
with
respect
to
the
long
island
sound
that
there
was
a
congressionally-approved
compact
setting
the
boundary
between
connecticut
and
new
york
in
long
island
sound,
a
thing
which
would
be
relevant
only
if
those
were
waters
of
those
two
states.
that
is
lacking
in
mississippi
sound.
there
was
a
long
history
of
enforcement
by
the
united
states
of
its
own
laws
against
foreign
vessels
in
long
island
sound,
not
true
with
respect
to
mississippi
sound.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a...
as
your
honor
rightly
says,
a
fort
was
more
or
less
constructed.
it
lasted
all
of
15
years.
it
was
never
quite
finished.
but
in
all
events,
let's
assume
that
it
was
an
indication
of
the
determination
actually
of
the
union
to
block
shipment
to
aid
the
confederacy;
nothing
much
to
do
with
international
relations.
but
even
if
it
was
intended
to
block
british
vessels
from
aiding
the
south,
it
does
not
indicate
any
view
that
the
waters
adjacent
to
that
fort,
fort
massachusetts
on
ship
island,
were
inland.
that
fort
was
designed
to
prevent
belligerent
traffic,
a
thing
permissible
to
do--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
freely
confess
that
like
all
others,
solicitors
general
had
fallen
into
error
in
the
past.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
that,
your
honor,
here
refers
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
litigation
to
which
the
united
states
was
not
a
party
entitled
louisiana
v.
mississippi,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
volume
202
of
united
states
reports
decided
in
1906.
it
is
argued
that
that
case
effectively
determined
that
mississippi
sound
was
inland
waters.
we
say
that
if
there
was
such
a
holding,
it
is
not
binding
on
the
united
states;
and
this
court
has
twice
made
that
point
by
indicating
in
the
first
california
case
and
in
a
subsequent
decision
that
louisiana
v.
mississippi
was
litigation
to
which--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--your
honor
is
of
course
correct,
but
this
court
laid
louisiana
v.
mississippi
aside
as
though
it
were
not
a
relevant
precedent
in
the
first
california
case.
but
in
all
events,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
decision
did
not
determine
that
mississippi
sound
as
a
whole
was
inland
water,
or
indeed
that
any
portion
of
it
was.
the
court
ruled
notice
on
close
examination
of
that
case
that
there
were
two
holdings.
one
was
that
certain
marshy
islands
in
st.
bernard
parish,
the
eastern
portion
of
louisiana,
should
be
treated
as
mainland
and
not
as
islands...
a
question
which
has
spawned
the
debate
on
that
score,
but
very
distinguishable
from
dauphin
island
or
from
long
island.
the
second
holding
was
that
the
dividing
line
between
mississippi
and
louisiana
ought
to
be
drawn
in
the
main
channel
which
went
south
of
cat
island
and
north
of
ilse
au
pitre.
and
the
issue
was
whether
that
rule,
the
thalweg
rule,
following
the
navigation
channel
was
a
rule
applicable
only
to
strictly
inland
waters
like
rivers.
the
court
said
not
so;
that
rule
can
apply
to
arms
of
the
sea,
to
lakes,
to
bays,
to
inlets,
and
so
it
seemed
to
territorial--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--not
to
the
open
sea,
but
the
court
seemed
to
say
to
territorial
waters.
since
it
was
speaking
of
a
belt
of
water
over
which
the
coastal
states
hold
sway,
language
appropriate
to
the
territorial
belt,
not
to
inland
water,
and
since
the
court
noted
that
the
mississippi
sound
was
waters
of
the
united
states,
because
the
openings
between
the
islands
were
less
than
six
miles,
the
distance,
twice
the
distance
of
the
territorial
sea.
the
decision
is
somewhat
ambiguous,
and
it
may
be
that
at
the
time
the
distinction
between
territorial
and
inland
waters
was
not
clear
either
in
international
or
national
law.
but
it
is
not
fair
to
treat
that
case
as
clearly
holding
what
was
unnecessary
to
hold,
that
mississippi
sound
as
a
whole
was
inland
water.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
on
two
occasions
in
the
louisiana
case,
the
solicitor--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
distinguishing
a
way
from
the
louisiana
context
what
had
been
thrown
up
as
an
example
of
inland
waters
form
islands...
that
is,
mississippi
sound.
and
he
said
this
is
very
unlike
mississippi
sound,
which
he
wrongly
said
this
court
had
previously
ruled
is
inland
waters
because
of
the
presence
of
the
islands
and
the
narrowness
of
the
gaps
between
them.
that
was
in
1958.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
but
he
did
so
with
his
main
eye
on
litigation
involving
louisiana,
not
concentrating
on
the
mississippi
situation.
but
he
also
was
then,
before
this
court
had
imported
the
international
convention
as
the
governing
rule,
concentrating
on
what
was
a
somewhat
vague,
but
nevertheless
different
approach
to
how
to
define
inland
waters.
it
may
be
that
under
the
approach
that
was
then
in
vogue,
it
was
proper
to
treat
inland
waters
as
defined
by
a
series
of
islands
reasonably
close
together.
that
approach
was
made
impossible
once
the
united
states
adhered
to
the
international
convention
in
1961
and
once
this
court
held
in
1965
that
that
convention
governed
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
those
two
ingredients
were
not
present
when
the
solicitor
general
somewhat
casually
distinguished
mississippi
sound
in
1958.
now,
turning
to
the
other
aspects
of
the
claim
of
historic
inland
water,
it
is
a
little
odd
to
be
claiming
that
this
court
so
decided,
and
therefore
mississippi
sound
is
historic
inland
water.
if
this
court
so
decided,
perhaps
that's
the
end
of
it.
but
historic
claim
is
a
claim
of
adverse
possession
contrary
to
the
rules
of
international
law.
that
requires
a
showing
that
this
nation
as
a
nation...
and
the
master
disregarded
all
evidence
of
state
action
on
the
ground
that
it
was
too
ambiguous,
it
didn't
show
inland
as
opposed
to
territorial
claims,
territorial
water
claims...
it
must
be
shown
that
this
nation
exercised
jurisdiction
of
the
body
of
water
as
inland
water.
the
only
clear
way
of
knowing
that
is
to
exclude
foreign
vessels...
not
one
bit
of
evidence
of
that
in
this
record.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
record
is
surprisingly
silent
with
respect
to
that,
but
we
can
suppose
that
this
being
a
well-known
fishing
area,
there
might
indeed
have
been
foreign
fishing
vessels
that
would
have
wished
to
come
into
the
area.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
channel
that
separates
dauphin
island
from
the
mainland,
though
somewhat

artificially

for
well
over
150
years,
if
i
remember
is
some
12
feet
in
depth.
some
other...
there
is
a
channel
all
the
way
to
lake

which
is
maintained.
mr.

claiborne
intercoastal
waterway.
and
it
accommodates
purely
coastal
vessels,
but
it's
an...
it's
an
artery
of
commercial
commerce.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
anywhere
from
6
to
and
perhaps
even
shallower
portions
up
to
10
feet,
i
think
i'm
correct
in
saying.
but,
of
course,
depth
has
never
been
in
international
law
a
criterion
for
high
seas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
right.
now,
this
nonconforming
use
by
the
united
states
of
the
area
as
its
own
inland
waters,
excluding
foreign
shipping,
must
have
been
clearly
asserted;
it
must
have
continued
for
a
long
period
of
time
so
as
to
develop
into
a
usage;
and
must
have
won
the
acquiescence
of
foreign
nations.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
say,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
burden
is
on
the
states
to
show,
and
indeed
as
this
court
has
said,
to
show
beyond
doubt
when
the
united
states
disclaims
the
area
as
its
own
historic
waters
that
history,
contrary
to
the
rules
of
international
law,
make
this
area
the
internal
waters
of
the
united
states--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--it
first
did
so,
justice
white,
in
1970.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
the
occasion...
this
lawsuit...
this
aspect
of
this
lawsuit
didn't
begin
until
ten
years
later.
the
occasion
for
that
was
that
there
was
a
delimitation
of
the
coast
of
the
entire
united
states.
a
committee
was
formed
for
that
purpose,
and
it
was
then
discussed
and
determined
that
what
had
once
been
supposed
to
be
inland
waters,
that
it
did
not
fit
the
rules
of
the
international
convention,
and
accordingly,
enclaves
must
be
drawn
inside
the
body
of
water.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
they
meet
all
the
tests
provided
one
takes
isle
au
pitre
as
an
extension
of
the
mainland,
and
it
is
of
the
same
sort
of
deltaic
formation
as
the
rest
of
those
waters
which
were
involved
in
this
court's
decision
in...
in
louisiana
v.
mississippi--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
isle
au
pitre
was
mentioned.
it's
hard
to
tell
from
the
decision
whether
isle
au
pitre
was
treated
as
part
of
the
mainland
or
as
an
island.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
a
history
bay.
i
may
say
that
the
official
line
of
the
united
states
is
not
in
isle
au
pitre
but
is
at
the
place
west
of
that.
in
the
hearing
of
this
case,
the
expert
for
the
united
states...
well,
i
think
it
was
in
answer
to
an
interrogatory...
we
conceded
that
isle
au
pitre
might
be
an
appropriate
headland,
and
we...
the
master
so
accepted,
and
we
have
not
accepted
the
previous
determination.
it
makes
no
practical
difference
whether--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--yes,
but
as
far
as
the
whole
chain,
if
one
means
the
chandeleur
sound
islands--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--west--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--yes,
but
that
is
a
determination
this
court
made
with
respect
to
all
but
perhaps
isle
au
pitre
in
louisiana
v.
mississippi
and
which
is
almost
unavoidable
because
it's
nothing
but
a
criss-cross.
our
map
is
a
little...
shows
a
bit
too
much
water
there.
if
you
follow
the
low
water
line--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--but
the
map
submitted
by
the
states
perhaps
gives
a
more
accurate
impression,
because
they've
used
a
darker
color.
i'll
reserve
what
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice:
with
respect
to
the
concession
by
the
solicitor
general
in
respect
to
mississippi
sound,
of
course
there
was
a
comparable
concession
in
the
very
case
with
respect
to
caillou
bay;
and
this
court
quite
expressly
held
that
that
was
not
binding,
nor
evidence
of
any
historic
inland
water
claim
for
that
area.
the
international
court
of
justice
in
the
norwegian
case
did
not
hold
that
they
were
extensions
of
the
mainland.
it
held
that
a
nation
may
enclose
islands
with
a
straight
baseline,
and
the
international
community
adopted
that
rule
in
article
4
of
the
1958
convention
after
the
international
court
had
vindicated
the
principle.
and
that
is,
of
course,
the
appropriate
role
if
it
were
chosen
by
the
united
states
in
this
case
to
enclose
mississippi
sound.
the
united
states
has
chosen
not
to,
and
what
this
case
is
is
an
effort
to
circumvent
that
decision
not
to
enclose
mississippi
sound
in
accordance
with
principles
vindicated
by
international
law,
but
optional
principles.
now,
mississippi
in
1905
was
arguing
that
mississippi
sound
was
high
seas
so
that
the
thalweg
rule
would
not
apply.
we
don't
tax
them
with
being
bound
by
that
any
more
than
we
are
by
what
the
solicitor
general
said
in
1957
or
'58.
i
should
point
out
that
in
the
so-called
exchanges
of
correspondence
diplomatically
there
is
not
a
single
instance
in
which
any
representative
of
the
united
states
addressing
a
foreign
government
pinpointed
mississippi
sound
as
inland
water,
nor
was
that
area
marked,
as
it
should
have
been
under
article
4,
as
inland
water
on
our
large-scale
maps.
there
were
some
generalized
statements
about
how
we
treat
and
define
inland
waters
which
could,
extrapolated,
mean
that
somebody
might
conclude
that
mississippi
sound
was
covered
by
them.
but
that
is
the
extent
of
it,
and
that
is
simply
not
evidence
clear
beyond
doubt
in
the
face
of
a
clear
disclaimer
by
the
united
states
sufficient
under
this
court's
cases
to
make
out
a
case
of
historic
water.
much
stronger
cases
were
made
by
california,
by
florida,
by
louisiana,
and
they
failed...
and
indeed
by
alaska.
this,
by
comparison,
is
a
weaker
case
and
ought
not
prevail.
