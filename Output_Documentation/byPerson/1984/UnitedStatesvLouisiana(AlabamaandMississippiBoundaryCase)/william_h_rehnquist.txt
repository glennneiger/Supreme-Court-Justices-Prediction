justice
rehnquist
well,
that...
that
might
be
true
as
to
res
judicata,
but
it's
certainly
not
true
as
stare
decisis.
you're...
you're...
a
decision
of
the
court
between
two
other
parties
on
a
question
of
law
binds
everybody.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
bruce,
what
does
the
record
show
with
respect
to
commercial
shipping
destined
or...
to
or
from
pascagoula
or
to
or
from
biloxi
or
to
or
from
gulfport?
does
the
record
show
how
that
shipping
moves
with
respect
to
mississippi
sound?
justice
rehnquist
but
my
question
is:
looking
at
the
defendant's
map
for
oral
argument
which
you've
passed
out,
how
does
shipping
move
to
and
from
gulfport,
i
mean
with
respect
to
those
various
islands
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
rehnquist
between
cat...
cat
island
and
ship
island.
justice
rehnquist
how
does
a
ship
coming
from
somewhere
else
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
approach
pascagoula?
justice
rehnquist
does...
does...
does
a
ship
headed
from
mobile...
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
a
ship
headed
from
mobile
either
to
gulfport
or
pascagoula,
would...
would
that
go
seaward
of
dauphin
island?
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
did
norway
make
that
request
of
the
united
states?
