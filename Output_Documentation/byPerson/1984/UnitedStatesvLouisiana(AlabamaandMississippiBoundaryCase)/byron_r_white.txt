justice
white
--if
you
don't
count
the
islands.
justice
white
yeah.
which
you're
not
suppose
to,
i
guess.
justice
white
when...
when
did
the
sg
concede
or
purport
to
concede
that
this
was
in
inland
waters?
justice
white
yes.
why
did
he?
he
must
have
felt
it
necessary
to
do
so.
justice
white
so
he...
he...
he...
he
misread
our
prior...
the
court's
prior
decisions,
too.
justice
white
when
did
the
united
states
first
indicate
this
position,
that
it
disclaimed
any...
disclaimed
these
waters
as
inland
waters?
justice
white
and
what
was
the
occasion
for
that,
the
starting
of
this
lawsuit?
justice
white
by
the
way,
what
was
the
basis
for
say...
saying
that
the
waters
inside
that
line
from
isle
au
pitre
to
the
coast...
what
was
the
basis
for
treating
the
waters
to
the
west
of
that
as
inland
waters?
justice
white
but...
but
they
weren't
adjudicated,
these
particular
islands.
this
was--
justice
white
--but
this
was...
is...
were
the
waters
treated
as
inland
waters
because
they
were...
they
were
a
juridical
bay?
justice
white
not
a
historic
bay.
justice
white
but
isle
au
pitre...
you
have
to...
all
those
islands,
that
whole
chain
of
islands
has
to
be
treated
as
a
part
of
the
mainland.
justice
white
well,
the
ones...
the
ones--
justice
white
--the
ones
southwest
of
isle
au
pitre--
justice
white
--for
your
case
it
shows
too
much,
that's
true.
justice
white
--i
take
it
you
support
the
reason
the
special
easter
gave
for
treating
dauphin
island
as
part
of
the
mainland.
justice
white
because?
why
do
they...
why
did
they
constitute
an
extension
of
the
mainland?
justice
white
the
reason
that
the...
the
same
reason
that
the
special
master
gave,
that
they
were...
abutted
inland
waters?
justice
white
well,
that's...
you
can't
find
that
obvious
stated
in
any
of
our
cases,
can
you?
justice
white
can
you
or
not?
justice
white
can
you
give
me
a
citation?
justice
white
to
support
the...
that
particular
holding
of
the
special
master?
he
didn't
cite
any,
did
he?
justice
white
well,
can
you
cite
any?
justice
white
where
does
the
baseline
intersect
dauphin
island?
at
the
east
end
of
it?
justice
white
why
does
it
include
all
of
dauphin
island
then?
justice
white
does
it
make
any
different
to
the
states
which
it
might
be?
