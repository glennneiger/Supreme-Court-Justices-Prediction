justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
claiborne,
i
guess
there
still
is
the
question
of
whether
it
should
he
treated
as
an
historic
bay.
justice
o'connor
and
when...
when
you
discuss
that,
i...
i
would
be
interested
to
know
what
facts
led
the
government
to
think
that
long
island
sound
meets
that
test,
but
mississippi
sound
does
not.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
during
the
civil
war,
a
fort
was
constructed
or
started
to
be
constructed
to
do
the
same
thing?
justice
o'connor
well,
didn't...
didn't
your-didn't
the
sg
take
a
contrary
position
about
mississippi
sound
at
one
point
and
concede
that
it
was
inland
waters?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
didn't
this
court
as
well
treat
it
as
inland
waters
and
apply
the
law
of
the
thalweg
to
some
question?
justice
o'connor
but
not
to
open
sea.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
if
the
water
is
so
shallow
that
it
isn't
used,
and
there's
no
evidence
of
such
use
by
foreign
vessels,
what
would
you
look
to?
justice
o'connor
how
does
the
evidence
satisfy
the
continuity
requirement
for
historic
status?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
does
the
evidence
introduced
in
this
proceeding
support
the
continuous
exercise
of
dominion
over
the
sound?
