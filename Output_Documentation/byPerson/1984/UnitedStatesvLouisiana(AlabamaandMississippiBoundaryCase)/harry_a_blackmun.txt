justice
blackmun
was
there
any
occasion
to
do
so,
mr.
claiborne?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
is
another
one
that
comes
to
us
under
our
original
jurisdiction.
despite
the
title,
the
united
states
against
louisiana
it
is
i
think
more
appropriately
called
the
alabama
and
mississippi
boundary
case.
it
is
just
another
chapter
in
the
litigation
that
has
to
do
with
the
ownership
of
lands
under
the
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico.
specifically
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
the
mississippi
sound,
the
body
of
water
immediately
south
of
the
mainland
of
alabama
and
mississippi,
consists
of
inland
waters
so
as
to
establish
in
those
states
rather
than
in
the
united
states,
ownership
of
the
lands
under
the
sound.
the
special
master
has
filed
a
report
in
the
report
which
he
concluded
that
the
whole
of
the
sound
qualifies
as
what
is
called
a
"historic
bay"
under
the
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
and
the
contiguous
zone
and
thus
constitutes
inland
waters.
the
united
states
and
alabama
and
mississippi
all
filed
exceptions
to
that
report.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
overrule
the
exception
of
the
united
states
and
confirmed
the
master's
report
and
find
no
need
to
reach
the
exceptions
that
were
filed
by
the
two
states.
we
conclude
that
on
the
record
the
master
correctly
determined
that
the
whole
of
mississipi
sound
is
a
historic
bay.
we
feel
that
the
facts
in
the
case
established
that
the
united
states
effectively
has
exercised
sovereignity
over
the
sound
as
inland
waters
from
the
time
the
louisiana
purchase
in
the
1803
until
1971
and
has
done
so
without
protest
by
any
foreign
nation.
this
historic
title
to
the
sound
as
inland
waters
ripened
prior
to
the
disclaimer
of
inland
water
status
by
the
united
states
in
1971.
and
that
disclaimer
was
insufficient
to
divest
the
states
of
their
entitlement
of
their
submerge
lands.
although
the
record
does
not
contain
evidence
of
actual
acts
of
exclusion
from
the
sound
of
foreign
navigation
and
innocent
passage.
such
evidences
not
invariably
essential
to
a
valid
claim
of
historic
inland
water
status.
mr.
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
the
considerational
or
decision
of
this
case
but
otherwise
the
judgment
is
unanimous.
