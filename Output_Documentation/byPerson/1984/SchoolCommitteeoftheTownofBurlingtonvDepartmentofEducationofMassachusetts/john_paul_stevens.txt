justice
stevens
mr.
berman,
could
you
help
me?
where
is
the
statute
in
the
papers
before
us?
i
seem
to
have
trouble--
justice
stevens
--it
is
at
page
127a.
127a?
thank
you.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand,
because
this
is
why
i
was
looking
for
the
statute.
in
your
view,
the
words
"the
then
current
educational
placement
of
the
child.
"
refer
to
the
school
he
was
scheduled
to
attend
in
the
fall
rather
than
the
one
he
had
been
in
in
the
spring?
justice
stevens
the
words
"shall
remain"
are
a
little
bit
hard
to
fit
into
that.
you
are
asking
that
he
remain
in
a
place
he
has
never
been.
"shall
remain
in
the
then
current
placement.
"
justice
stevens
the
state
statute
was
preempted.
justice
stevens
of
course,
you
and
your
opponent
disagree
on
what
the
then
current
placement
was.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
during
the
summer
vacation
period,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
the
then
current
period
refers
to
the
pst
rather
than
the
future?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
one
can
argue
it
either
way,
is
all
i
am
suggesting.
justice
stevens
he
was
on
vacation.
he
was
on
vacation,
wasn't
he?
justice
stevens
don't
we...
excuse
me.
there
is
something
else
that
is
not
clear.
the
proposal
was
not
in
writing.
was
there
an
actual
proposal--
justice
stevens
mr.
rosenberg,
don't
we
have
another
threshold
question
as
to
what
is
the
relevant
date
for
deciding
what
the
last
current
placement
was?
because
you
are
referring
to
the
date
of
the
plan,
which
would
have
been
during
the
earlier
year.
he
refers...
your
opponent
refers
to
the
date
the
proceedings
had
started,
i
think,
july,
and
the
statute
says
during
the
pendency
of
any
proceeding,
the
then
current
placement
shall
be--
justice
stevens
--isn't
there
room
for
argument
on
which
is
the
right
date
to
focus
on?
justice
stevens
could
i
just...
excuse
me.
even
if
you
are
right,
the
parent
and
the
school
agreed
that
his
present
placement
was
inappropriate.
justice
stevens
mr.
berman,
just
a
minute.
you
went
too
fast
for
me.
you
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
but
it
would
make
a
difference
if
they
ultimately
found
the
iep
to
be
a
good
iep,
wouldn't
it?
then
they
would
be
stuck
with
the
costs.
justice
stevens
then
you
can't
say
it
is
totally
without
remedy.
justice
stevens
are
you
saying
that
if
it
is
ultimately
found
to
have
been
a
bad
iep,
they
had
a
duty
to
leave
the
child
there
for
the
entire
period
it
takes
to
litigate
the
question?
justice
stevens
is
that
your
position?
justice
stevens
no
matter
how
bad
the
iep
might
have
been?
justice
stevens
no
matter
how
bad
the
iep
might
have
been?
justice
stevens
but
until
they
get
a
court
to
act
or
judicial
relief
of
some
kind,
the
child
must
remain
there
at
all--
