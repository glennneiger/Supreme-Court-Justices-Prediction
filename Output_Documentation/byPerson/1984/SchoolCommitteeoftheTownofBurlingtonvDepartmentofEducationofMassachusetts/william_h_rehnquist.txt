mr.
berman,
does
it
strike
you
as
at
all
odd
that
congress
should
have
given
the
school
authorities
the
right
to
appeal
from
the
superintendent
of
education's
decision
to
the
federal
court?
justice
rehnquist
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
feel
that
that
bore
on
the
plan
now
proposed?
justice
rehnquist
does
that
make
much
sense
to
you?
justice
rehnquist
well,
were
there
repeated
and
continuing
procedural
violations?
justice
rehnquist
what
were
they
in
addition
to
the
one
you
have
already
given?
justice
rehnquist
that
is
all
now
to
be
assessed
against
the
school
board
on
this
new
plan?
justice
rehnquist
how
could
procedural
violations
in
a
preceding
year
affect
as
plan
that
is
now
up
on
the
merits?
justice
rehnquist
--yet
it
seems
to
have
done
that.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
child
is
being
mainstreamed
under
this
type
of
program
and
has
been
in
placement
in
a
sixth
grade,
in
a
school
district
which
has
an
elementary
school
that
goes
only
through
sixth
grade,
then
in
the
next
year
he
would
normally
be
expected
to
go
to
junior
high
school,
in
a
different
building,
a
different
school.
now,
i
think
these
things
probably
arise
during
the
summer.
what
is
the
child's
current
placement
during
the
summer
between
sixth
grade
and
seventh
grade?
justice
rehnquist
well,
whether
they
arise
or
not,
what
is
the
child's
placement
during
the
summer
between
the
sixth
and
seventh
grades?
justice
rehnquist
and
would
it
be
a
new
placement
for
the
child
to
move
in
the
normal
progress
of
age
to
the
seventh
grade?
