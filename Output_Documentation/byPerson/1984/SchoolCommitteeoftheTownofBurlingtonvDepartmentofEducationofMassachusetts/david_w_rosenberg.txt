mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
address
the
three
factual
points
that
will,
i
hope,
place
the
question
of
the
appropriate
construction
of
1415(e)(3)
in
proper
context
for
the
court.
first
of
all,
the
question
of
whether
in
this
particular
case
the
town
and
the
parents
otherwise
agreed
that
the
then
current
placement
of
michael
panico
should
be
changed,
about
that
point
i
think
there
should
be
no
dispute.
the
child
was
in
a
school
known
as
the
memorial
school.
he
was
in
a
particular
kind
of
placement
known
in
the
jargon
as
a
502.2
prototype,
which
means
that
he
was
in
a
class,
a
regular
class
at
least
75
percent
of
the
time,
and
he
was
going
to
be
in
a
special
class
25
percent
of
the
time.
now,
in
the
spring
of
1979,
what
the
school
proposed
was
to
change
that
placement,
to
change
his
then
current
placement
in
two
senses
of
the
word.
first,
physically.
they
were
going
to
move
him
to
a
totally
different
school,
the
pine
glen
school.
secondly,
they
were
going
to
put
him
in
a
different
type
of
prototype,
namely,
a
502.4
prototype,
which
means
that
the
child
would
have
been
in
a
substantially
more
restricted
placement
in
which
he
was
in
the
school
in
a
special
class
at
least
75
percent
of
the
time.
now,
the
parents
and
the
school
both
agreed
that
the
child's
then
current
placement
was
not
appropriate,
so
on
the
facts
of
this
case
it
appears
to
me
that
the
entire
operation
of
1415(e)(3)
does
not
even
come
into
play.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
i
understand
that
we
disagree.
i
am
simply
saying
that
under
1415(e)(3),
the
then
current
educational
placement
is
not
a
really
mystical
concept.
it
is
a
factual
question.
what
was
the
child's--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--that
is
my--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--in
my
view,
the
then
current
placement
was
where
the
child
was
at
the
time
the
iep
in
question--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--not
at
the
time
the
individual
educational
plan
which
is
the
subject
of
this
entire
proceeding,
was
being
constructed.
he
was
in
another
school.
the
plan
was
proposed
for
the
next
school
year,
and
that
is
what
this
long
litigation
has
been
all
about,
what
the
next
school
year's
plan
and
subsequent
years'
would
be.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
yes,
there
is--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--there
is--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--yes,
your
honor,
there--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--the
proposal
which
the
town
made
is
found
in
the
joint
appendix.
it
is
an
individual
educational
plan.
it
goes
on
for
eight
or
ten
pages.
and
it
contains
elements
of
an
individual
educational
plan.
the
placement,
that
is,
once
you
write
the
plan,
where
do
you
put
the
child,
that
is
not
or
may
not
be
specifically
in
the
written
language,
but
that
was
going
to
be
in
this
gentleman,
mr.
mcaleer's
class.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
well,
i--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--there
is
room
for
argument
because
it
has
been
argued.
i
don't
frankly
concede
the
point
that
what
congress
was
looking
at
at
this
particular
statute
when
they
used
the
word
"the
then
current
educational
placement"
is
the
one
that
was
in
place
in
the
summer
after
the
parents
had
initiated
the
administrative
procedure
to
challenge
the
plan,
which
is
exactly,
of
course,
what
congress
intended
the
parents
to
have
the
right
to
do.
so,
the
second
fact
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
well,
there
was
a
placement,
and
it
was
in
the
memorial
school--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--there
was
a
placement,
and
it
would
be
the
height,
i
think,
of
absurdity
to
have
the
child
placed
in
a
placement,
the
memorial
school,
which
both
the
town
and
the
parents
had
agreed
was
inappropriate.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
it
may
well
be.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
that's
correct.
but
the
primary
aim
of
the
act,
in
my
view,
is
to
make
sure
that
a
child
is
provided
with
a
free,
appropriate
public
education,
and
in
the
summer
of
1979,
the
parents
of
michael
panico
were
faced
with
a
dilemma.
they
had
been
told
by,
among
other
people,
a
reading
specialist
in
the
school,
the
burlington
schools,
a
catherine
black,
that
the
proposed...
placement
proposed
by
the
town
was
not
appropriate
for
that
child.
and
they
had,
based
on
that
recommendation,
plus
recommendations
from
neurologists
at
massachusetts
general
hospital,
rejected
the
plan
and
exercised
their
rights
in
complete
conformity
with
massachusetts
and
federal
regulations
to
trigger
an
administrative
hearing.
now,
that
hearing
was,
through
no
fault
of
the
parents,
not
going
to
be
scheduled
until
well
after
september
of
1979,
and
consequently
in
september
of
1979
or
more
appropriately
late
august
they
had
a
dilemma.
do
they
place
the
child
in
the
proposed
placement
which
their...
the
people
they
had
consulted,
including
a
school
teacher,
had
informed
them
was
inappropriate
for
the
child,
or
do
they
in
fact
place
the
child
in
the
placement
they
believed
was
appropriate,
go
through
the
hearing
process,
and
if
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
process
their
decision
or
their
belief
was
upheld,
then
the
hearing
officer
or
eventually
the
court
in
their
view
would
retroactively
grant
them
tuition
reimbursement
from
the
beginning
of
the
year.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
they
do
not
in
the
normal
case,
with
all
due
respect,
arise
in
my
view
if
people
are
doing...
following
the
regulations
properly
in
the
summer.
they
arise
in--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--it
is
the
prior
placement.
the
then
current
placement,
i
think,
is
what
was
intended.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
well,
in
that
case,
your
honor,
i
think
if
he
was
simply
moving
from
the
same
type
of
class,
let's
say
a
regular
sixth
grade
to
a
regular
seventh
grade
class,
i
believe
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
maintain
that
the
sixth
grade
was
the
correct
placement.
in
this
case
we
are
dealing,
as
i
have
explained,
i
think,
before,
that
the
school
wanted
the
child
placed
in
a
totally
different
kind
of
educational
environment.
now,
let
me--
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
--that's
what
i
believe.
now,
let's
assume
because
it
is
really
the
difficult
task
in
front
of
this
court
that
it
is
clear
that
the
child's...
that
the
parents
did
something
that
the
town
characterizes
as
1415(e)(3).
let's
assume
that
the
placement
was
changed
unilaterally
by
the
parents.
now,
in
my
view,
the
statute
on
its
face
does
not
contain
the
sanction
or
the
bar
or
the
jurisdictional
elements
that
the
town
would
urge
this
court
to
accept.
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
which
says,
if
you
"violate"
the
statute,
you
lose
your
right
to
reimbursement.
now,
i
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
the
real
point
of
this
section
was
that
in
fact
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
there
was
a
practice
of
excluding
children
from
the
public
schools
who
were
handicapped
and
excluding
or,
more
appropriately,
dumping
children,
as
the
phrase
is
called,
into
inappropriate
classes.
i
believe
that
this
statute
was
in
fact
enacted
based
on
the
consent
decree,
as
in
the
mills
and
park
case,
which
i
have
cited,
to
prevent
a
school
department
from
excluding
the
child
without
parental
consent
during
the
pendency
of
those
actions.
and
there
is
some
support
beyond
my
simply
asserting
it
in
the
department
of
education's
own
interpretations
of
this
section,
although
it
is
a
scant
reference
to
it.
there
is
an
appendix
to
the
regulations
in
which
the
department
gives
interpretive
rulings.
one
of
the
interpretive
rulings
deals
with
what
this
section
means,
and
says,
among
other
things,
if
because
of
the
disagreement
over
the
iep
a
hearing
is
initiated
by
either
the
parents
or
agency,
the
agency
may
not
change
the
child's
placement
unless
the
parents
and
agency
agree
otherwise.
now,
in
my
view,
if
the
court
were
to
reach
the
reverse
result,
that
the
parents
were
disabled
from
receiving
tuition
reimbursement
once
they
had
"unilaterally
withdrawn"
the
child
from
the
school
system,
and
if
two
years
later
that
child
is
eventually
found
by
the
hearing
officer
to
have
been...
or,
more
appropriately,
the
parents'
placement
was
appropriate,
and
the
school's
chosen
placement
was
inappropriate,
then
for
that
two-year
period
that
child
will
have
been
denied
either
the
appropriate
portion
of
the
free
appropriate
public
education
to
which
he
or
she
had
been
entitled,
or
if
the
parents
pay
for
that
placement
during
the
two
years,
then
the
child
will
have
been
denied
the
free
portion
of
the
free,
appropriate
public
education.
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
the
state?
mr.
david
w.
rosenberg
well,
that
is
my
view.
the
town's
view
is
that
if
you
once
use
what
they
characterize
as
self-help,
then
forever
after
you
are
barred
as
a
parent
from
seeking
reimbursement
for
tuition
under
the
provisions
of
1415(e)(2).
thank
you
very
much.
