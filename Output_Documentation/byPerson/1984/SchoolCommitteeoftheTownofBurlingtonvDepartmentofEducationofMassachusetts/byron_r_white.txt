justice
white
what
if
the
decision
had
been
unfavorable?
what
if
the
decision
had
been
that
the
local
school's
plan
for
the
child
was
quite
proper?
justice
white
so
they
have
no...
if
the
school
is
providing
a
proper
plan,
the
parents
unilaterally
may
not
remove
them
and
get
reimbursement?
justice
white
yes.
oh,
yes.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
but
ultimately,
ultimately
there
was
a
court
finding
that
the
plan
was
all
right.
justice
white
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do
with
that
plan?
what
did
it
find
wrong
with
the
school's
plan?
justice
white
well,
suppose
the
district
court
considers
everything
it
is
supposed
to
and
still
rules
against
the
parents?
and
still
holds
that
the
plan
is
a
good
plan?
justice
white
what
are
these
procedural
violations
that
the
state
hearing
officer
and
the
court
of
appeals
felt
were
important?
justice
white
are
you
suggesting
that
unless
we
agree
with
you,
the
local
school
would
have
left
the
child
in
that
placement
that
the
parent
and
the
locals
agreed
was
inadequate,
was
not
right?
justice
white
well,
i
thought--
justice
white
--well,
that's
right,
but
the
school
wouldn't
have
left
him
in
that
inappropriate
placement.
the
school
would
have
implemented
their
proposed
placement,
i
suppose.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be.
the
school
easily
could
have
moved
him
to
another
school.
justice
white
but
the
placement
was
still...
there
was
still
a
placement.
justice
white
and
just
because
they
disagreed,
or
just
because
they
agreed
on
that
and
disagreed
on
the
new
placement
didn't
remove
the
fact
that
there
was
a
placement.
justice
white
so
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
argue
that
there
is
no
room
for
1415(e)(3)
at
all,
because
there
was
a
placement.
justice
white
well,
it
may
also
be
absurd
then
to
say
that
therefore
1415(e)(3)
has
no
place
at
all
because
you
cannot
consider
the
new
placement.
justice
white
it
certainly...
at
least
there
was
a
placement.
the
school
didn't
want
him
out
of
the
school
system.
justice
white
and
that
is
certainly
one...
one
aim
of
the
act
is
to
have
the
public
schools
provide
these
placements.
justice
white
in
that
event
i
suppose
the
state
will
have
to
pay
the
parents.
justice
white
or
the
local
school
district.
justice
white
is
that
your
position,
the
position
that
the
gentleman
has
stated?
justice
white
let's
suppose
you
completely
lose
in
all
respects
what
is
on
the
remand
to
the
district
court,
on
the
new
trial.
justice
white
let's
assume
it
is
found
that
whatever
plans
you
had
were
wholly
inadequate.
the
state
was
quite
right.
do
you
then...
do
you
still
say
then
that
you
are
entitled...
that
you
didn't
need
to
reimburse
the
parents
for
tuition?
justice
white
that
is
what
i
thought.
