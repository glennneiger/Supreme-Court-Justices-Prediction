we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
school
committee
of
burlington
against
the
department
of
education
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
mr.
berman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
did
he
consult
with
the
school
authorities
before
that
transfer
was
made?

justice

chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
think
congress
had
in
mind
about
parents
taking
these
steps
on
their
own
initiative
unilaterally,
without
consultation?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
mean
congress
contemplated
that
the
parents
could
pick
any
school
any
place,
any
institution
they
wanted?
chief
justice
burger
who
ultimately
passes
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
amount
of
the
cost?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
would
assume
that
if
the
parents
unilaterally
decided
that
some
specialist
in
paris
or
geneva
was
the
best
remedy
for
the
problem,
if
they
sent
the
child
off
abroad,
they
might
have
difficulty
collecting
all
the
costs.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rosenberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
berman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
