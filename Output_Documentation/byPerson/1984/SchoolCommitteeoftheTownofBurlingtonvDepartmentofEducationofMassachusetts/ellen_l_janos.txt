mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
two
question
of
statutory
interpretation
involving
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act.
it
is
the
department
of
education's
position
that
the
language
of
the
act,
the
history
of
the
act,
and
its
purpose
clearly
demonstrate
congress's
intent
to
allow
parents
to
be
reimbursed
for
private
school
tuition
at
the
conclusion
of
judicial
proceedings.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
we
don't
think
congress
intended
to
bar
parents
from
making
traditional
educational
choices.
we
don't
think
that
the
plain
language
of
that
section,
which
clearly
does
not
say
anything
about
reimbursement
or
bar,
does
act
as
a
bar
under
an
otherwise
appropriate
award
under
the
statute.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
congress
contemplated
private
school
placements
under
the
act.
that
is
certain.
and
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
displace
traditional
choices
on
the
part
of
parents
to
place
their
child
in
an
appropriate
school.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
intended,
as
was
followed
in
this
case,
for
parents
to
follow
all
the
procedural
requirements
of
the
act,
that
is,
go
through
the
educational
planning,
as
the
parents
and
the
town
did
here;
if
they
disagree,
to
file
a
claim
with
the
administrative
agency,
as
they
did
here;
and
then
wait
for
that
decision
from
the
administrative
agency,
which
in
this
case,
of
course,
was
in
favor
of
the
parents;
and
then
if
they
are
entitled
to
reimbursement
after
a
favorable
decision,
then
that
is
when
the
request
is
made.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
if
the
decision
had
been
unfavorable,
the
parents
are
then
taking
a
risk
by
appealing
to
state
or
federal
court
that
they
may
not
prevail,
and
that
they
may
not
get
any
reimbursement.
so
that
they
probably
would
not
get
reimbursement.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
we
believe
they
can
remove
them
at
any
time
they
want.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
but
they
may
not
be
able
to
collect
for
reimbursement--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--if
the
state
finds
that
the
town's
plan
is
appropriate,
which
was
not
the
case
here,
and
if
the
court
ultimately
finds
that
the
town's
plan
is
appropriate.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that
court
finding
has
been
set
aside,
your
honor.
the
first
circuit
set
aside
the
decision,
has
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial,
so
that
there
has
been
no
final
judicial
determination
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
town's
plan.
the
only
decision
in
effect,
if
you
will--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
district
court
failed
to
take
into
consideration
a
number
of
factors
that
the
state
hearing
officer
had.
some
of
those
factors
included
substantive
and
procedural
violations
on
the
part
of
the
town
in
preparing
that
plan
and
in
preparing
previous
plans.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
we
agree
with
the
first
circuit's
decision
that
at
least
for
the
period,
the
year
period
that
the
state
ordered
the
child
in
the
private
school,
the
parents
should
not
be
financially
responsible
for
that
period.
for
the
other
two
years,
that
question
remains
open,
and
the
court
articulated
certain
criteria,
certain
equitable
factors
which
the
district
court
on
remand
should
take
into
consideration.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
the
year
before
the
town
had
proposed
a
plan
for
the
child
and
had
in
the
middle
of
the
year
or
actually
closer
to
the
beginning
of
the
year
cut
the
child's
special
education
reading
time
in
half
without
any
notice
to
the
parents.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
the
court
of
appeals
believed
the
district
court
should
consider
that
in
determining
whether
the
town
had
the
ability
and
the
capacity
to
implement
that
plan.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
to
some
extent
it
does.
to
some
extent
there
are
repeated
and
continuing
procedural
violations.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
there
were...
the
hearing
officer
in
this
case
found
yes,
and
we
believe
yes.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
in
earlier
years
the
town
had
failed
to
notify
the
parents
regarding
certain
meetings
that
were
supposed
to
take
place.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that
is
all
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
two
respects
on
remand.
in
one
respect,
whether
that
affected...
whether
they
were
so
serious
as
to
affect
the
appropriateness
of
the
plan.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
it
might
affect
the
town's
ability
to
implement
a
new
plan.
if
they
have
shown
in
the
past...
it
may
not,
of
course.
i
mean,
we
need
to
flesh
these
out
at
trial
and
see
exactly
what
they
were.
it
may
not.
but
it
may
affect
the
town's
ability
to
implement
the
plan.
mr.
rosenberg
will
address
in
more
detail
the
parents'
right
to
move
their
child
to
a
private
school,
and
i
would
just
like
to
address
the
district
court's
statutory
authority
under
section
(e)(2)
to
award
tuition
reimbursement
for
private
school
tuition.
i
would
just
like
to
state
in
response
to
mr.
berman
that
we
disagree
vigorously
that
the
state
hearing
officer
found
the
plan
appropriate.
she
did
not.
she
found
the
plan
inappropriate
based
on,
among
other
things,
the
ability
of
the
classroom
teacher
to
teach
this
particular
child,
and
she
felt
that
the
type
of
children
that
were
in
this
class
were
not
suited
to
the
child
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
so,
she
found
the
plan
inappropriate,
and
then
she
found
other
procedural
violations
as
well.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
i
believe
the
first
circuit
has
instructed
the
district
courts
to
determine
at
the
conclusion
of
the
judicial
proceedings
what
would
be
the
appropriate
amount
of
reimbursement
if
indeed
reimbursement
is
sought,
and
instructed
the
district
courts
to
take
into
consideration
the
prevailing
party,
of
course,
and
other
traditional
equitable
factors.
so
it
would
be
the
district
court.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
they
might
have
difficulty
in
that
situation,
yes.
the
factual
circumstances
surrounding
the
placement
of
the
child
in
a
private
school
should
and
will
be
considered
by
the
district
court
if
and
when
the
town
requests
reimbursement
from
the
parents.
the
first
circuit
told
the
court
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
that
is
what
we
are
really
talking
about
when
you
are
seeking
an
award
under
statutory
language
that
allows
the
court
to
grant
appropriate
relief.
is
it
appropriate
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case?
and
that
is
really
all
the
first
circuit
has
said,
and
we
believe
that
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute,
that,
number
one,
tuition
reimbursement,
given
the
design
and
nature
of
the
statute,
that
is,
that
handicapped
children
are
entitled
to
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education,
that
that
means
education
at
no
cost
to
parents,
without
charge,
that
an
award
of
tuition
reimbursement
under
appropriate
circumstances
is
simply
the
allocation
of
financial
responsibility
for
an
appropriate
placement.
and
here,
of
course,
we
have
a
placement
that
has
been
in
effect
for
the
last
five
years
that
the
state
ruled
was
the
appropriate
placement.
ultimately
the
district
court,
of
course,
can
review
that,
but
in
the
meantime
we
have
a
period
of
five
years
in
which
the
child
has
been
in
a
placement
ordered
by
the
state
educational
agency.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that's
correct.
we
also
agree
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
town
and
the
parents
have
otherwise
agreed
that
the
placement
which
was
in
effect,
the
then
current
educational
placement,
was
not
the
appropriate
placement
for
the
child,
so
that
there
really
in
this
case
have
been
two
agreements.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
well,
this
case--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--not
exactly.
this
case
was
brought
under
both
the
state
and
federal
statute.
the
first
circuit
in
the
first
go-round
dismissed
the
state
case
and
allowed
this
case
to
proceed
only
under
the
federal
statute.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
yes.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that's
correct.
and
allowed
it
to
dismiss
only...
to
proceed
only
under
the
federal
statute.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
not.
i
would,
in
my
remaining
few
minutes,
because
i
am
going
to
yield
to
mr.
rosenberg,
who
will
discuss
in
more
detail
(e)(3),
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
tuition
reimbursement
does
not
impose
any
additional
financial
burdens
on
the
town.
it
imposes
only
that
financial
responsibility
for
providing
an
appropriate
placement,
and
that
is
clearly
what
congress
intended
and
what
the
act
requires.
in
many
cases,
and
this
is
one
of
them,
tuition
reimbursement
would
be
the
only
appropriate
relief,
the
only
meaningful
relief
for
parents
who
choose
to
exercise
their
rights
and
go
through
the
administrative
process
as
they
have
done
here.
in
response
to
your
question
earlier,
justice
rehnquist,
we
do
agree
that
we
think
it
is
odd
that
congress
would
have
allowed
towns
to
appeal
to
federal
court,
at
least,
and
embroil
the
federal
courts
into
a
dispute
between
the
towns
and
the
state
as
to
the
appropriate
educational
placement.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
it
seems
to
have
done
that.
perhaps
it
really
means
the
towns
should
appeals
to
state
court
and
let
the
state
court
deal
with
those
internal
problem
as
opposed
to
the
federal
courts.
we
believe
the
legislative
history,
at
least
on...
and
i
am
addressing
myself
to
(e)(2),
the
right
to
tuition
reimbursement...
supports
our
reading
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
and
as
i
stated,
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
provide
handicapped
children
with
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education.
requiring
parents
to
choose
either
a
free
or
an
appropriate
education
could
not
be
what
congress
intended.
awarding
tuition
reimbursement
would
encourage
towns
at
the
outset
to
provide
an
appropriate
plan
that
the
child
will
be
in
an
appropriate
placement
during
the
pendency
of
the
proceedings.
and
we
believe
that
the
equitable
criteria,
the
factors
articulated
below,
that
is,
that
the
parties
should
cooperate
with
each
other,
they
should
act
in
good
faith
towards
each
other,
those
traditional
equitable
factors
should
be
considered
in
an
award
of
tuition
reimbursement.
this
statute
requires
a
long-term
partnership
between
towns
and
parents.
they
must
work
together
year
after
year
devising
educational
plans,
and
in
a
request
for
tuition
reimbursement
it
is
certainly
appropriate
to
take
into
account
factors
such
as
good
faith
and
compliance
with
the
act.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
yes.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
the
party
who
is
appealing
from
the
state
agency
decision
should
bear
the
burden
of
overturning
that
state
agency
decision.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
town
appealed.
the
parents
won
at
the
state
agency
level,
and
the
town
appealed,
and
we
believe
that
the
town
bears
the
burden
of
showing
that
in
fact
it
had
an
appropriate
plan
for
the
child.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that
was
not
in
the
plan.
that's
correct.
it
had
been
approved
by
the
state
once
the
parents
filed
their
appeal
and
went
to
the
state
hearing.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
the
parents,
of
course,
are
in
a
difficult
choice
at
that
point
when
they
have...
in
this
case
there
was
advice
from
the
child's
teacher
and
the
child's
doctor
that
the
school
could
not
offer
an
appropriate
placement.
this
was
in
the
summer.
and
they
had
a
choice
to
make.
and
if
we
take
petitioner's
reading
of
that
statute,
that
child
would
still
be
in
that
what
we
consider
to
be
the
inappropriate
placement
for
the
next
five
years.
we
don't
think
congress
intended
to
keep
children
in
inappropriate
placements,
and
we
think
that
an
award
of
tuition
reimbursement
under
appropriate
circumstances--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--if
we
take
the
petitioners'
reading
of
that
statute,
the
parents
cannot
move
their
child--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--and
the
child
would
have
had
to
remain
in
that--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--well,
it
is
their
proposed
placement
which
our
state
found
inappropriate,
so
that--
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
--they
could
have,
of
course,
but
then
they
would
need
to
go
through
all
of
the
procedures
for
removing
the
child.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
l.
janos
that's
correct,
and
which
is
now
going
back
for
trial
to
determine
that.
i
will
yield
the
rest
of
my
time
to
mr.
rosenberg.
thank
you
very
much.
