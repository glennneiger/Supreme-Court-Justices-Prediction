justice

do
you
plan
to
argue
the
legal
issue
that
we
have
to
resolve
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
because
i
didn't
think
that
we
were
going
to
review
the
propriety
of
the
iep
here.
i
thought
we
had
granted
cert
to
decide
the
legal
issue,
whether
tuition
was
reimbursable
under
1415's
provisions,
assuming
it
is
decided
at
the
trial
court
level
on
remand
that
an
adequate
iep
was
not
offered.
justice
o'connor
mr.
berman,
your
brief
acknowledged
that
there
was
no
effective
placement
in
effect
when
the
new
iep
was
drawn
up.
if
that
is
so,
when
how
was
1415(e)(3)
violated
when
the
parents
enrolled
michael
in
carroll
school?

justice
o'connor
well,
it
just
didn't
seem
to
meet
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
o'connor
and
it
is
effective
without
the
parents'
consent,
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
it
is
effective
without
the
parents'
agreement,
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
even
though
he
hadn't
yet
enrolled
and
the
parents
hadn't
consented?
justice
o'connor
isn't
that
some
support
for
the
position
taken
by
your
opponents
that
the
purpose
of
this
subsection
of
the
statute
was
to
prevent
the
removal
by
school
authorities
of
a
child
who
was
in
an
effective
placement
without
the
consent
of
the
parents?
i
mean,
there
is
some
justification.
justice
o'connor
ms.
janos,
in
your
reading
of
section
1415(e)(3),
do
you
think
that
the
language
of
it
should
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
state
in
this
case
and
the
parents
have
agreed?
justice
o'connor
and
it
is
your
position
that
the
state
as
such
by
virtue
of
the
board's
ruling
has
agreed
with
this
placement?
justice
o'connor
now,
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
meaning
of
1415(e)(3),
do
i
understand
that
massachusetts
has
a
state
law
that
would
allow
reimbursement
of
tuition
in
any
event?
justice
o'connor
regardless
of
how
we
decide--
justice
o'connor
--1415
should
be
interpreted?
justice
o'connor
it
said
it
was
preempted.
justice
o'connor
all
right,
so
that
question
is
not
before
us,
the--
justice
o'connor
we
are
only
dealing
here
with
the
proposed
placement--
justice
o'connor
--that
the
school
district
had
proposed.
justice
o'connor
and
which
the
parents
and
the
state
have
found
was
inappropriate.
justice
o'connor
in
other
words,
placement
may
not
refer
at
all
to
the
normal
progression
of
a
child
within
the
same
type
of
class
in
the
public
school
system.
but
a
change
would
refer
to
the
type
of
educational
program.
