justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
jr.
i
am
confused
by
your
use
of
the
word
"damages".
are
any
damages
being
claimed
in
this
case
other
than
reimbursement
of
tuition
and
the
additional
expense
of
sending
the
child
to
the
private
school?
justice
jr.
yes,
so
that
when
you
use
the
term
"damages",
you
are
talking
about
tuition
and
reimbursement
for
other
expenses,
not
damages
in
the
tort
sense
that
may
include
punitive
damages
under
some
circumstances?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
jr.
assuming
there
has
been
cooperation,
and
finally
in
the
end
the
parents
and
school
district
disagree.
which
of
those
two
parties
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
appropriateness
of
its
position
or
the
parents'
position?
justice
jr.
that
means
the
parents?
justice
jr.
the
parents
in
this
case
finally
placed
the
child
in
a
school
that
had
not
been
approved
by
the
school
district?
justice
jr.
yes.
