mr.
david
berman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
june
4th,
1979,
the
school
officials
of
the
town
of
burlington
conducted
a
core
evaluation
to
determine
the
appropriate
future
placement
for
michael
panico,
a
learning
disabled
child
who
is
handicapped
within
the
meaning
of
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act.
as
a
result
of
that
evaluation,
they
determined
that
the
appropriate
placement
for
this
child
was
a
classroom
in
the
pine
glen
school,
which
is
a
public
school
of
the
town
of
burlington.
this
was
a
classroom
for
children
with
special
needs,
and
it
was
taught
by
a
teacher
named
john
mcaleer,
who
had
had
considerable
success
in
dealing
with
children
of
special
needs,
especially
children
with
learning
disabilities
and
reading
disabilities
such
as
michael
then
had.
the
plan
contemplated
that
michael
would
take
mathematics
sooner
or
later,
but
hopefully
sooner,
with
non-handicapped
students,
and
that
he
would
be
immediately
integrated
with
non-handicapped
students
in
such
non-academic
subjects
as
athletics,
music,
and
art.
before
the
plan
was
even
committed
to
paper,
michael's
parents
made
up
their
mind
to
reject
it,
and
they
did
reject
it
as
soon
as
they
got
it,
on
july
3rd;
1979.
on
july
17th,
1979,
his
parents
appeal
to
the
bureau
of
special
education
appeals
of
the
department
of
education
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
and
sough
a
hearing
on
their
complaint
that
the
iep
was
inadequate.
that
date
is
a
very
important
date,
because
at
least
as
of
that
date
proceedings
were
pending
pursuant
to
the
statute.
in
august
of
1979,
michael
was
enrolled
in
a
private
school
in
lincoln,
massachusetts,
exclusively
for
children
with
learning
disabilities,
known
as
the
carroll
school.
mr.
david
berman
he
informed
the
school
authorities,
your
honor,
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
transfer.
he
did
not
ask
their
permission
to
do
so,
and
he
did
not
receive
permission
to
do
so.
mr.
david
berman
i
am
informed
now,
your
honor,
that
the
youngster
is
in
a
private
school
in
beverly,
massachusetts,
called
the
landmark
school.
at
least
that
is
where
he
was
when
i
was
last
informed
of
his
whereabouts.
now,
the
hearing
officer
conducting
proceedings
in
the
months
of
september,
october,
and
november
of
1979,
and
on
january
31st,
1980,
she
rendered
a
decision,
and
in
her
decision,
she
made
certain
findings
and
rulings
which
are
not
necessarily
consistent
with
each
other.
but
first
of
all,
she
said,
yes,
this
iep,
this
individual
educational
plan...
i
will
call
it
an
iep
henceforth...
was
appropriate.
she
said
that
mr.
mcaleer
was
indeed
an
excellent
teacher.
she
noted
the
carroll
school
was
a
private
school
exclusively
for
children
with
learning
disabilities,
and
she
noted
that
the
pine
glen
school
was
a
public
school
with
opportunities
for
main
streaming
a
child,
which
is
the
word
that
is
used
to
describe
taking
a
handicapped
child,
as
federal
law
requires,
and
putting
him
into
the
mainstream
of
activity
with
non
handicapped
children.
nevertheless,
she
did
not
uphold
the
iep
that
was
written
earlier.
she
said,
first
of
all,
that
michael
needed
a
form
of
teaching
reading
known
as
orton-gillingham,
that
he
needed
small
classes,
that
he
needed
a
supporting
peer
group,
meaning
other
children
who
have
learning
disabilities,
and
he
needed
freedom
from
distraction.
now,
except
with
respect
to
the
supporting
peer
group,
petitioners
have
never
doubted
that
michael
needed
all
these
things,
but
they
never
could
understand
why
that
would
be
a
basis
for
rejecting
their
plan,
since
he
would
have
received
all
of
them
at
the
pine
glen
school
from
mr.
mcaleer.
finally,
she
said
over
a
long
period
of
time
these
school
authorities
have
violated
any
number
of
procedural
rights
that
belong
to
this
child,
and
therefore
i
doubt
whether
they
have
the
capacity
to
implement
this
plan
in
the
future.
now,
again,
it
is
very
unclear
just
what
she
meant
by
that.
did
she
mean
that
the
school
authorities
were
going
to
yank
this
child
out
of
the
class
in
the
middle
of
the
year
or
do
something
like
that?
no
one
can
really
answer
that
question,
i
think,
very
well.
if
that
is
what
she
meant,
she
certainly
had
no
basis
whatsoever
for
making
that
kind
of
judgment.
on
february
26,
1980,
less
than
a
month
after
that
opinion
was
rendered,
the
petitioners,
who
are
the
school
committee
of
the
town
of
burlington
and
the
town
itself,
brought
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
under
title
20
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1415(e)(2).
mr.
david
berman
well,
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
really,
strike
me
as
odd,
although
i
am
constrained
to
admit
that
it
did
strike
me
odd
when
i
first
thought
about
the
statute,
and
i
thought,
why
would
congress
want
to
give
the
school
authorities
this
kind
of
power
to
seek
review?
but
then
i
realized
what
congress
had
in
mind.
congress
realized
that
education
of
the
handicapped
was
to
be
a
joint
effort,
and
it
was
a
joint
effort
that
involved
the
parents,
that
involved
the
states,
and
that
involved
the
local
educational
authorities.
and
i
think
congress
recognized
that
local
educational
authorities,
your
honor,
have
an
interest
in
seeing
that
the
programs
that
they
spend
vast
amounts
of
money
to
set
up
are
vindicated
in
the
courts,
if
need
be,
'and
that
it
is
made
clear
through
the
courts
that
they
are
capable
of
educating
handicapped
children,
because
that
is
what
they
are
supposed
to
do.
they
are
not
supposed
to
dump
handicapped
children
on
the
private
schools.
they
are
supposed
to
integrate
them
into
the
public
schools.
so
that
is
why
i
think
congress
gave
the
local
educational
authority
that
right
to
seek
review.
now,
in
july
of
1980...
this
is
about
five
months
after
the
action
was
brought...
the
school
authorities
asked
mr.
panico
if
he
would
make
his
son
available
for
a
new
evaluation
that
would
have
led
perhaps
to
a
new
or
amended
iep.
mr.
panico
flatly
said
no,
i
will
not
do
it.
a
few
months
later,
mr.
panico
said,
well,
maybe
i
will
do
it,
but
you
have
to
hire
all
new
people,
who
have
no
connection
with
your
school,
if
you
want
me
to
cooperate,
and
that
is
something
that
of
course
the
school
authorities
refused
to
do.
in
february
of
1981,
the
department
of
education
threatened
to
cut
off
all
of
the
federal
funds
to
the
petitioners
unless
they
started
funding
michael's
education,
which
was
way
past
the
iep,
i
should
point
out,
way
past
the
year
for
which
the
iep
was
drawn
at
the
carroll
school.
faced
with
that
ultimatum,
the
school
committee
did
start
in
february
of
1981
to
pay
for
the
tuition
of
michael
at
the
carroll
school,
and
pay
for
his
transportation,
with
the
strict
understanding,
however,
that
if
the
petitioners
prevailed
after
a
trial,
the
petitioners
would
have
that
money
reimbursed
to
them,
and
indeed,
that
understanding
is
enshrined
in
the
first
opinion
that
was
to
be
rendered
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
this
case,
and
that
was
rendered
in
june
of
1981.
in
may
of
1982,
there
was
a
trial.
the
judge
took
the
hearing
officer's
decision
as
prima
facie
evidence
on
all
acts
therein
stated.
she
said
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
school
department,
petitioners
here,
for
the
year
1979-1980,
and
for
subsequent
years
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
parents.
the
trial
produced
on
both
sides
unusually
competent
expert
testimony,
and...
i
say
both
sides.
i
should
say
on
the
side
of
the
parents
and
on
the
side
of
the
school
committee.
the
department
of
education
offered
no
evidence
at
the
trial.
but
one
thing
about
that
testimony
i
think
is
terribly
important.
the
respondent's
expert,
dr.
levine,
never
stated
an
opinion
as
to
what
was
an
appropriate
placement.
he
wouldn't
touch
that
subject.
the
petitioner's
expert,
dr.
kinsmore,
was
very
forthright
on
it.
he
said
that
not
only
did
he
find
the
pine
glen
school
to
be
the
equal
of
the
carroll
school,
he
thought
it
was
superior
to
the
carroll
school.
he
pointed
out
that
the
progress
that
the
child
had
made
in
three
years
a
to
the
carroll
school
had
been
no
better
than
the
child's
progress
during
his
first
three
years
when
he
wasn't
in
any
special
school
at
all,
but
was
merely
getting
one
hour
of
tutorial
at
the
memorial
school.
and
both
doctors
agreed...
a
very
important
point,
i
dare
say...
that
the
type
of
remediation
that
would
have
been
offered
at
the
pine
glen
school
was
a
good
remediation
for
this
child.
mr.
david
berman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
berman
yes,
your
honor.
i
shall--
mr.
david
berman
--your
honor,
there
are
actually
two
issues
as
to
which
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
one
is
the
effect
of
1415(e)(3),
and
the
second
one,
which
is
highly
related
to
it,
is
whether
damages,
or
tuition
reimbursement,
whatever
one
wishes
to
call
it,
can
be
awarded
under
1415(e)(2).
i
would
like
to
address
1415(e)(3)
first.
and
this
is
a
statute
which
says,
"during
the
pendency
of
any
proceedings
conducted
pursuant
to
this
section,
unless
the
state
or
local
educational
agency
and
the
parents
or
guardian
otherwise
agree,
the
child
shall
remain
in
the
then
current
educational
placement
of
such
child,
or
if
applying
for
initial
admission
to
a
public
school,
shall
with
the
consent
of
the
parent
or
guardian
be
place
in
the
public
school
program
until
all
such
proceedings
have
been
complete.
"
now,
i
deliberately
read
both
clauses
of
that
statute,
not
just
the
first
clause,
because
one
of
the
arguments
that
respondents
make
in
their
briefs,
especially
the
respondent
panico,
is
that
this
statute
only
bars
the
local
educational
agency
or
the
state
educational
agency
from
changing
the
placement
of
a
child
while
proceedings
are
pending.
it
has
no
bar
whatsoever
against
the
parents,
and
that
can't
be,
because
in
the
second
clause,
the
very
same
sentence
of
this
statute,
when
congress
intended
to
say
that
only
the
consent
of
the
parents
is
needed,
it
said
so
in
very
clear
language.
it
said,
"with
the
consent
of
the
parent
or
guardian.
"
when
congress
wanted
an
agreement
of
both,
it
said
so
again
in
perfectly
clear
language.
mr.
david
berman
well,
it
is
found
amongst
many
other
places
at
page
28b
of
the
statutory
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
it
is
also
found
in
the
appendix
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
which
is
the
last
opinion
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
david
berman
now,
there
is
yet
another
reason
why
the
suggested
reading
that
the
parents
would
give
this
statute
is
untenable,
because...
notice
what
congress
says.
it
says
during
the
pendency
of
any
proceeding.
now,
if
we
turn
back
to
section
1415(b)(2),
we
make
a
discovery
that
it
is
only
the
parent
who
can
actually
commence
proceedings,
and
they
commence
their
proceedings
when
they
make
a
complaint
about
an
iep.
they
say
this
iep
is
a
bad
iep,
it
is
not
good
for
our
child,
and
that
is
how
proceedings
are
commenced.
so,
who
is
going
to
change...
who
is
likeliest
to
change
the
placement
of
a
child
while,
the
proceedings
are
pending?
plainly
it
is
the
parents.
it
is
not
going
to
be
the
school
department.
now--
mr.
david
berman
--i
don't
think
my
brief,
your
honor--
mr.
david
berman
--acknowledges...
it
says,
if
there
was
no
effective
placement.
that
still
would
not
give
them
the
right
to
make
a
change
in
placement.
there
was
no--
mr.
david
berman
--there
is
no
effective
placement
in
the
sense
that
the
parents
have
rejected
the
iep,
but
there
is
certainly
a
placement,
your
honor,
in
the
practical
sense
that
there
is
a
classroom
to
which
this
child
is
expected
to
report
the
following
september.
that
is
a
placement
in
the
sense
that
the
school
authorities
have
made
a
place
for
this
child
in
this
classroom
and
told
the
teacher
to
expect
him
there,
and
told
the
parents--
mr.
david
berman
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
david
berman
as
an
interim
basis.
we
are
talking
about
an
interim
placement.
yes,
your
honor.
on
an
interim
basis
it
is
effective.
now,
i
would...
i
think,
you
know,
we
could
have
a
situation
where
the
parents
wanted
to
keep
the
old
placement,
and
that
might
raise
a
very
different
situation,
but
of
course
here
the
parents
did
not
want
the
old
placement
kept
at
all,
so
that
was
never
really
a
problem.
now--
mr.
david
berman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
berman
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
i
think
that
i
would
really
suggest
that
the
way
congress
has
written
1415(e)(3),
placement
of
a
handicapped
child
is
a
little
like
domicile.
you
never
lose
it.
a
handicapped
child
at
all
times
has
a
placement,
which
is
the
placement
to
which
he
will
be
assigned
some
time
in
the
future
or
to
which
he
is
presently
assigned.
just
as
he
doesn't
lose
his
placement
over
the
christmas
recess,
so
he
doesn't
lose
his
placement
over
the
summer
recess
simply
because
it
hasn't
taken
effect
yet.
mr.
david
berman
well,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
your
honor
that
the
word
"remain"
is
a
troublesome
word,
but
i
think
congress
in
most
instances
considers
remaining
in
the
sense
of
remaining
in
a
placement
that
has
been
put
there
on
paper
as
opposed
to
remaining
physically
in
a
placement.
mr.
david
berman
that
is...
the
use
of
the
word
"remain"
is
some
support
for
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
berman
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
now,
the
question
of
damages.
oh,
before
i
get
to
that,
the
word
"agree".
both
respondents
argue
that
where
the
parents
prevail
at
the
administrative
or
due
process
level,
as
it
is
sometimes
called,
there
has
been
an
agreement
with
respect
to
placement.
i
disagree
with
that.
what
they
have
really
done
when
they
have
written
that
is
to
suggest
that
when
congress
said
during
proceedings
under
this
section,
they
really
meant
proceedings
under
1415(c).
that
is
not
what
congress
said.
congress
did
not
say
proceedings
under
1415(c).
it
said,
while
proceedings
under
this
section
are
pending.
now,
what
the
parents
really
argue,
and
i
think
this
is
the
heart
of
their
argument,
is
that
if
1415(e)(3)
is
construed
as
congress
wrote
it,
it
is
unworkable.
it
will
not
accomplish
its
purpose.
but
i
think
there
is
a
fallacy
that
runs
through
that
argument,
and
the
fallacy
is
that
most
placements
are
going
to
be
bad;
parents
are
going
to
be
right
most
of
the
time,
school
authorities
are
going
to
be
wrong
most
of
the
time.
if
you
take
the
reverse
of
that
proposition
and
assume
that
most
of
the
time,
as
was
the
case
here,
the
school
authorities
will
be
right
and
the
parents
will
be
wrong
when
they
disagree,
and
if
you
allow
room
for
agreement,
for
a
new
interim
placement
while
proceedings,
are
pending,
and
you
allow
room,
as
we
think
you
should,
for
a
court
to
issue
a
preliminary
injunction
in
cases
of
an
absolutely
dreadful
placement,
then
i
think
the
statute
will
not
affect
the
efficacy
of
1415(e)(3)
at
all.
now,
the
subject
of
damages.
we
seem
to
be
involved
here
in
a
semantic
argument,
and
i
say
that
with
full
remembrance
of
justice
frankfurter's
admonition
that
most
of
the
business
of
this
court
does
involve
semantics.
the
parents
and
the
school
department
say,
well,
awarding
damages,
awarding
reimbursement
is
not
the
same
as
awarding
damages.
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
when
reimbursement
is
awarded
for
prior
tuition,
that
is
as
much
an
award
of
damages
as
any
other
kind
of
damages
that
you
may
get,
and
indeed
damages
in
law
very
often
involve
reimbursement.
reliance
damages
which
the
court
of
appeals
talked
about
from
january
of
1980
through
june
of
1980,
i
don't
understand
that
either.
how
could
the
parents
possibly
have
relied
on
a
decision
that
they
knew
was
being
appealed?
mr.
david
berman
yes,
sir.
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
david
berman
no
other
damages
are
the
subject
of
the
case
in
its
present
posture,
your
honor.
mr.
david
berman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
as
far
as
procedural
damages
go,
everyone
talks
about
procedure
in
terms
of
the
statement
in
rowley
made
by
justice
rehnquist
that
procedures
are
at
the
very
heart
of
this...
of
eha,
and
i
agree
with
that.
petitioners
agree
with
that.
the
problem
is
that
when
we
are
talking
about
procedures,
in
rowley
this
court
was
talking
about
those
procedures
in
1415
that
were
meant
to
safeguard
a
parent's
right
to
a
due
process
hearing
and
the
parent's
right
to
obtain
information.
i
don't
believe
this
court
in
rowley,
when
it
suggested
that
procedures
were
at
the
heart
of
eha,
meant
any,
any
kind
of
procedure
anywhere,
no
matter
how
recondite,
no
matter
how
technical,
to
say,
well,
any
time
there
is
a
violation
of
that
kind
of
procedure,
there
will
be
damages
under
eha.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
what
this
court
meant
in
rowley,
and
i
think
when
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
did,
it
went
wrong.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
save
as
much
time
as
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
berman
briefly.
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
david
berman
--no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
we
are
not
saying
that
they
are
forever
barred.
we
believe
that
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
rowe
case,
rowe
against
the
henry
county
school
board,
used
exactly
the
right
format.
they
said,
let's
see
whether
the
later
change...
whether
the
change
is
still
related
to
the
unlawful
change.
if
it
is
not,
we
will
take
another
look.
mr.
david
berman
yes.
mr.
david
berman
yes,
we
do
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
berman
yes.
certainly
not
for
the
year
1979-1980,
and
that
is
the
only
year
that
should
be
considered,
because
that
is
the
only
year
for
which
there
is
an
iep
in
effect.
they
couldn't
draw
one
for
subsequent
years.
as
far
as
the
remedy
for
violating
1415(e)(3),
if
the
remedy
is
not
to
cut
off
the
right
to
tuition,
what
remedy
is
there
for
1415(e)(3)?
how
is
1415(e)(3)
going
to
be
implemented
at
all?
are
we
going
to
say
to
parents
in
effect,
well,
you
were
very
naughty,
you
did
something
you
shouldn't
have
done,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference?
and
i
would
like
to
point
out,
by
the
way,
since
we
have
talked
about
procedure,
that
procedure
is
a
two-way
street.
yes,
there
are
procedures,
and
local
educational
agencies
must
comply
with
those
procedures.
mr.
david
berman
yes,
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
david
berman
--it
is,
though,
because
if
the
local...
if
the
iep
is
found
to
be
a
good
iep,
they
are
always
stuck
with
the
cost.
mr.
david
berman
your
honor,
they
had
a
duty
to--
mr.
david
berman
--well,
they
certainly...
yes,
they
had
a
duty
to
leave
the
child
there
at
least--
mr.
david
berman
--it
was--
mr.
david
berman
--except
for
one
thing,
your
honor.
i
do
believe
they
have
a
right
to
go
to
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
try
to
obtain
preliminary
relief.
that
i
have
no
doubt
about.
mr.
david
berman
the
child
must
remain
in
his
current
placement.
and
as
i
say,
i
start
out
on
the
supposition
that
most
of
the
time
the
school
authorities
are
going
to
be
right,
not
wrong.
and
in
those
cases
where
they
are
wrong,
i
think,
you
know,
there
are
various
bases
for
getting
relief
without
using
self-help.
with
respect
to
justice
o'connor's
question
to
me,
i
did
look
at
page
42
of
our
brief.
my
point
there
was
there
was
no
placement
in
effect
when
the
iep
was
drawn
up,
not
that
there
was
no
placement
in
effect
when
michael
was
enrolled
in
the
carroll
school.
those
are
two
entirely
separate
things.
the
iep
was
drawn
up
on
june
4th,
and
he
was
enrolled
in
the
carroll
school
in
august.
with
respect
to
two
years
later
when
the
hearing
officer
renders
an
opinion,
why,
the
regulations
require
that
an
opinion
be
rendered
within
40
days,
and
if
the
hearing
officers
in
the
various
states
are
violating
that
provision,
then
it
is
high
time
the
secretary
of
education
stepped
right
in
and
said,
you
violate
that
provision,
you
will
have
no
federal
funding.
thank
you.
