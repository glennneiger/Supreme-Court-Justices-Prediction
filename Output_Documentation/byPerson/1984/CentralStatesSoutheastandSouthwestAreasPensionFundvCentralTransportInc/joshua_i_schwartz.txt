mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
view
of
the
united
states
that
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
both
the
employment...
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974
and
the
particular
trust
agreements
that
underlie
this
case
authorize
petitioners'
trustees
to
confirm
by
prudent
auditing
activities
that
employers
participating
in
the
pension
and
health
and
welfare
funds
are
making
full
contributions
on
behalf
of
all
the
employees
for
whom
they're
due.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
government
does
agree
that
this
case
could
be
decided
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
the
trust
agreement.
we
think--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--that's
my
understanding,
justice
brennan.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
among
other
things.
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
alternative
proposed
by
the
respondents
of
looking
to
the
union
is
not
adequate.
we
think
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
court's
decisions
establish
that
that
wouldn't
be
the
exclusive
route
anyway,
but
there
is
a
good,
practical
reason
why
that's
correct.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
respondent
so
states
in
his
brief,
and
that's
the
extent
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
that
they
do
have
other
plans.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
we
don't
have
any
reason
to
doubt--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--it
is
our
contention
that
in
order
to
ascertain
that
all
the
employees
who
belong
within
a
particular
plan
are
in
fact
having
contributions
made
for
them,
that
a
selective
random
sample
would
not
exclude
someone
merely
because
the
employer
says
oh,
they're
in
that
plan,
so
they
can't
be
in
yours.
it
does
not
stand
to
reason
that
merely
because
the
employer
says
that
is
so,
and
in
fact
may
be
so,
that
it's
correct.
but
a
major--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--if...
if...
if
the
employer
established
that
particular
employees
were
in
fact
doing
the
other
kind
of
work
that
brought--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--then...
then
the
audit
would
be
done.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
the
government's
position,
i
think
we
rely
on...
on
the
schneider
case
from
last
term,
that...
that
the
trustees
are
not
bound
by
the
separate
proceedings
by
which
two
unions
and
an
employer
might
resolve
their
disputes
as
to
coverage.
the
employer
has...
the
trustees
have
a
right
to
determine...
and
the
focus
is
very
factual...
what
kind
of
work
is
being
done.
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
is
no
role
for
deference
to
the
other
kinds
of
proceedings
that
resolve
the
question
of
which
work
belongs
in
which
plan.
but
the
employee...
the
trustee
still
has
a
right--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--to
find
out
the
facts
of
what
kind
of
work
an
individual
is
doing.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
the...
i
believe
this
point
is
actually
addressed
in...
in
the...
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioners
and
is
not
in
our
own
brief.
but
it's
my
own
understanding
that...
that
if
in
fact
you
are
covered,
then...
then
contributions
are
due
to
be
made.
and
it's
also
my
understanding,
although
largely
based
on...
on...
on
petitioners'
argument
in
that
reply
brief,
but
there
are
procedures
available
to
see
that
the
employee
never
comes
up
short,
and
also
that
the
employer
need
not
make
two
sets
of
payments.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
no,
it...
it's...
i...
i
don't
think
so.
the
audit
authority
would
extend
to
those
people.
is
that--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--but
the
question
is
whether
that--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--whoever
thought
that,
thought
so
correctly.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
you
don't
audit
100
percent.
you
audit
selectively.
but
you
need
not
exclude
someone
chosen
at
random
simply
because
the
employer
tells
you--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--well,
i
think
that's
a
question
of...
of
prudent
professional
auditing
judgment,
just
as
we're
not
arguing
that
you
must
do
an
audit
in
every
case.
accountants
and
auditors
have
professional
standards
as
to
what
is
a
sufficient
sampling...
a
very
small
number,
we're
clear...
to
provide
assurance.
and
if
you
try
a
few
and
you
get
wrong...
get
discrepancies,
then
you
look
at
more.
if
you
try
a
few
and
you
don't
get
discrepancies,
you
don't
look
at
more.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i...
your
honor...
justice
powell,
we
think
that
generally
there's
not
a
problem
here,
because
contrary
to
what
respondents
suggest,
this
is
a
basic
problem
of
jurisdictional
dispute.
our
understanding
is
that
the
problem
is
essentially
omissions,
people
who
drop
out
of
sight,
particularly
in
certain
industries
where
employment
is
seasonal,
variable,
or
temporary
or
there's
a
lot
of
shifting
between
employers,
and
the
secretary
of
labor
has
reason
to
believe
that
a
lot
of
people
just
drop
out
of
the
system,
and
that
there
are
omissions,
and
that
therefore
it
is
unrealistic
to
think
of
this
as
a
back-door
form
of
jurisdictional
warfare
among
unions.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes,
because
the...
it's
precisely
in
those
situations
where...
where
the
union
may
well
not
know
who
was
there.
and
in
addition--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--if...
i'm
trying
to
communicate
the
idea
that
these
are
relatively
simple
factual
determinations.
if
you
pick
out
a
file
and...
and
the
employment
application
shows
20
years
of
truck
driving
and
three
merit
awards
for
safe
driving,
and
the
employer
claims
that
this
is
in
the
book...
this
person
is
in
the
bookkeepers
union,
i
think
an
auditor
would
be
qualified
to
say
that
this
is
a
suspect
determination,
and
to
inquire
further
on
the
basis
of
that.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
kind
of...
and
it
is
those
kind
of
factual
things
that
the
auditors
are
looking
for
and
that
they
are
reasonably
qualified
to...
to
engage
in.
and
then,
of
course,
the...
the
fund
trustees
sit
down
with
the...
with
the
employers
and
work
out
the
initially
determined
discrepancies,
and
the
employer,
of
course,
has
the
opportunity
to...
to
say
well,
there
really
is
an
explanation
for
this.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
no.
quite
the
reverse,
justice
white.
we
do
believe
that
it
could
be
decided--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--on
what
the
trust
agreements
mean.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yeah.
i
should
also
point
out
there's
a--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--that's
right.
because
the
statute
does
rather
clearly
in
the
language
that
you
read
say
except
where
inconsistent,
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
language--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
take
the
position
in
the
last
section
of
our
brief
that
it
does
quite
clearly
provide
for
it.
in
fact,
that
was
the
basis
of
our
suggestion
when
the
court
initially
asked
for
the
government's
views
on
the
case,
that
the
case
should
be
simply
sent
back
in
light
of
language
in
the
schneider
case,
which
we
thought
read
the
same
trust
agreement
the
same
way
that
we
did.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
as
i
read
the
statute...
and
i
looked
to
section
1020...
section
1023(a)(3)(a),
the
statute
requires
that
an...
that
the
plan
trustees,
when
filing
their
annual
report
with
the
secretary,
have
their
own
independent
auditor
look
at...
assess
and
test
the
books
of
the...
of
the
plan
and
make
such
tests
as
are
required
by
generally
accepted
accounting
standards.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
justice
white--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--it's--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--it's
not
clear
to
me
that
it
would
always...
if
i
may
answer,
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
it
would
always
be
prudent
to
do
that.
the
statute
seems
to
place
the
burden
on
the
trustees.
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
i
think
that
solution
is
not
an
adequate
answer
to
the
case.
the
first
is
i
do
not
read
respondents
as
accepting
that
solution,
although
the
court,
of
course,
would
differ.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
the
second...
the
second
is
there
is
the
problem
of
cost,
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondents
were
very
concerned
about
the
cost
of...
of
these
procedures.
and
it's
reasonably
clear
to
me
that
the
cost
would
be
greater
were
the
trust
fund
to
have
to
bear
the
cost
of
retaining
respondents'
independent
auditor
to
do
this
audit.
it's
also
not
at
all
clear
to
me
as
i
read
deloitte...
deloitte's
haskins
&
sells
brief
that
this
offer
of
comity
essentially
among
auditors
is
one
that
is
available
to
anyone
other
than
the
independent
auditor,
which
is
arthur
young,
and
not
mr.
luplow's
client.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
