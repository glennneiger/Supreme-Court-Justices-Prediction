justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
do
the
employers
have
separate
and
different
retirement
plans
for
the
60
percent
of
their
employees
who
are
not
in
the
union?
justice
jr.
--who
are
covered
by
other
plans
also
have
to
be
within
the
audit?
justice
jr.
if...
if...
if
the
employer
simply
proved
that
a
particular
group
of
employees
were
covered
by
a
different
plan,
say
a
plan
that
had
been
approved
by
erisa.
justice
jr.
well,...
well,
my
question--
justice
jr.
--well,
suppose
the...
there
was
a
disagreement
as
to
whether
the
work
was
other
kind
of
work
or
not.
if
the
employee
were
covered
under
another
plan,
is
it
the
government's
position
that...
that
the
trustees
could...
could
audit
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
agreed
with
the
type
of
work
being
done?
justice
jr.
is
your
answer
to
justice
brennan
that
the
government
hasn't
taken
a
position
on
the
question
he
asked
you?
justice
jr.
so
the
audit
authority
would
include
people
covered
by
another
plan
when
obviously
they
wouldn't
have
been
included
under
it
if...
if
it
had
not
been
thought
they
were
doing
work
outside
of
the
union.
justice
jr.
yes,
but--
justice
jr.
--yes.
so
you
audit
all
100
percent
of
the
employees.
justice
jr.
who
decides
how
many
you
audit?
justice
jr.
are
auditors
competent
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
work
being
done
comes
within
a
particular
plan
or
not
or
under
a
particular
union
agreement
or
not?
justice
jr.
do
you
think...
you
really
think
the
auditors
are
better
equipped
to
do
that
than
the
union
itself?
justice
jr.
but
the
auditors
would
know
better
about
the
type
of
work--
