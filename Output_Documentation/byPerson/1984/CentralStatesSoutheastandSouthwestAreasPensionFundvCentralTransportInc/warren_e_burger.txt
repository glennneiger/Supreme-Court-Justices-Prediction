mr.
luplow,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
now.
chief
justice
burger
maybe
the
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
luplow,
is
to
point
to
the
very
reasons
that
brought
erisa
into
being.
it
was
a
lack
of
confidence
in
how
the
unions
were
handling
these
matters,
was
it
not,
to
a
large
extent?
chief
justice
burger
yes.
chief
justice

mr.
schwartz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
schwartz.

mr.
moran.
chief
justice
burger
how
else
would
the
public
have
any
way
of
knowing
whether
a
union
or
the
employer
hadn't
by
tacit
agreement
decided
to
do
these
people
in
and
not
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
trust
or
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
burger
some
of...
some
of
these
unions
have
been
notable
for
some
other
factors
in
connection
with
trust
funds,
too,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
burger
well,
corruption
in
the
trust
funds.
chief
justice
burger
i'm
not
addressing
the
particular
unions.
i'm
talking
about
the
thrust
and
the
purpose
of
this
whole
program
in
the
minds
of
congress.
what
were
they
trying
to
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
luplow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
