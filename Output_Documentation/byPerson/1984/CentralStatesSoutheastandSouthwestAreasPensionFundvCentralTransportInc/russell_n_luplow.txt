mr.
russell
n.
luplow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
first
impression
which
we
believe
is
of
great
national
importance
as
it
relates
to
the
national
pension
policy.
the
petitioners,
the
central
states
pension
and
health
and
welfare
funds
conduct
random
audits
to
verify
whether
contributing
employers,
such
as
central
transport,
are
reporting
accurately
on
behalf
of
all
persons
covered
by
applicable
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
issue
in
this
case
before
this
court
is
whether
in
conducting
these
audits
the
trustees
may
request
access
to
records
beyond
those
of
employees
for
whom
the
employer
admits
liability.
it
is
the
trustees'
claim
that
they
have
a
right
to
a
more
comprehensive
audit
in
this
context
under
their
trust
agreement
and
under
the
prudent
manual
of
erisa.
the
sixth
circuit,
in
reversing
the
district
court,
limited
the
trustees'
audit
rights
to
records
of
those
employees
that
the
employer
admitted
were
covered
and
only
to
those
unless
the
trustees
could
show
cause
why
a
particular
employee
was
omitted,
in
which
case
that
person,
the
particular
employee's
records
could
then
be
audited.
the
petitioners
are
health
and
welfare
and
pension
funds
located
in
chicago.
they're
regulated
by
the
taft-hartley
act
and
erisa.
they
have
over
half
a
million
participants
and
beneficiaries
with
over
12,000
employers,
and
there
are
thousands
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
apply
to
the
fund.
the
respondent,
central
transport,
is
16
companies
engaged
in
trucking
and
related
industries,
all
parties
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
commonly
referred
to
as
the
national
master
freight
agreement
with
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters.
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
transport
obligation
is
to
remit
contributions
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
on
each
employee
who's
performing
work
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
fund's
obligation,
the
petitioners'
obligations
on
the
pension
plan,
which
is
related
to...
which
is
governed
by
the
erisa
in
its
trust
agreement,
is
to
give
credits
or
benefits
to
persons
on
the
basis
of
covered
employment
for
pensions
as
a
matter
of
law
if
they
perform
work
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
this
is
the
case
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
employer
defaults
on
his
contributions.
the
funds,
of
necessity
because
of
their
scope,
operate
on
a
self-reporting
system
which
we
refer
to
as
an
honor
system.
the
way
it
works
simply
is
that
the
employer
sends
to
the
fund
each
month
a
list
of
the
employees
that
the
employer
says
are
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
he
sends
along
a
check
for
that
amount.
the
trustees,
who
are
familiar
with
misreporting
problems
in
a
multi-employer
setting,
have
enacted
a
trust
agreement
that
this
court
looked
at
in
february
of
this
year
in
prosser
and
schneider.
and
in
that
trust
agreement,
the
trustees
provided
for
an
audit
provision
that
provided
in
article
3,
section
5,
that
the
trustees
shall
be
empowered
to
conduct
on
site
audits
of
pertinent
records
of
a
contributing
employer
to
verify
for
the
accuracy
of
the
reports.
in
implementing
that
program,
the
trustees
conduct
random
audits.
in
this
particular
case,
in
1980
the
funds
sought
to
conduct
a
random
audit
of
central
transport.
the
auditors,
upon
arriving,
or
shortly
thereafter,
at
central
transport,
were
told
by
the
officials
of
central
transport
that
60
percent
of
the
employees
of
central
transport,
which
was
engaged
primarily
in
the
trucking
industry,
were
not
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
company
then
refused
to
produce
any
documentation
to
the
fund's
representatives
to
produce
or
to
support
its
contention
that
these
60
percent
of
the
employees
were
not
covered.
as
to
the
records
that
they
allowed
us
to
audit,
those
of
employees
that
they
admitted
they
owed
liability
on,
the
fund
determined
that
there
were
over
$268,000
in
audit
findings.
now,
to
be
sure,
those
audit
findings
are
subject
to
the
employer's--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--$268,000
in
audit
findings,
which
means
that
a
preliminary
investigation
by
our
auditors
reflected
that
there
were
$268,000
in
contributions
that
should
have
been
sent
in
that
were
not.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
okay.
thank
you.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
the--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
they
are
not.
they
are
definitely
not.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
our
plan
is
the
national
master
freight
agreement,
and
the
plan
itself
does
not
require
union
membership
for
participation.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
response
to
that
has
to
be
found
in
404
or
erisa,
the
prudent
manual,
and
i
believe
that
it
would
be
what
is
prudent,
prudent
and
reasonable
in
the
circumstances.
to
audit
an
employer
three
or
four
times
a
year
when
in
particular
the
prior
audits
indicated
active
reporting
would
be
unreasonable
and
clearly
unwarranted.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
fiduciary
duties
of
erisa
are
the
trustees'
alone.
the
union
does
not
have
a
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
that
is
correct.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
we
are
the
fiduciaries
exclusively
under
erisa.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
your
honor,
they
are
ours.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
that's
correct.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
trust
agreement,
in
particular,
article
3,
section
5,
and
the
trust
agreement,
article
4,
which
is
the
rulemaking
powers
of
the
trustees,
as
well
as
the
interpretive
powers
of
the
trust
agreement,
as
incorporated
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
articles
55
and
56,
which
the
transport
and
the
union
negotiated,
which
incorporated
the
trust
agreement...
they
agreed
to
incorporate
it
and
to
ratify
all
actions
taken
or
to
be
taken
by
the
trustees'
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
and
article
3,
section
5
of
the
trust
agreement
is
our
audit
authority.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
this
court
could
presume
so.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
that's
correct.
we
think
that
there--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
amend
the
trust
agreement?
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
your
honor,
the...
the
settlors
of
the
trust,
if
you
will,
which
was
established
in
1950,
'55--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--gave
the
amendment
powers
exclusively
to
the
trustees.
they
passed
the
gauntlet
to
the
trustees,
and
so
the
trustees
have
the
right
to
amend
the
trust
agreement
when
they
think
it's
prudent
to
do
so
under
the
circumstances.
so
it
is
not
difficult
to
amend
the
trust
agreement,
but
in
this
particular
case,
because
of
the
breadth
and
scope
of
the
sixth
circuit's
ruling,
an
amendment
of
the
trust
agreement
would
not
get
the
job
done
here,
because
the
sixth
circuit
said,
as
i'll
get
to
in
a
minute,
if
the
court
please,
that...
that
erisa
doesn't
allow
you
to
do
this
the
way
they
interpreted
our
contract;
you
can't
do
it.
but
furthermore,
the...
the
holding
that
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
even
attempt
to
do
an
audit
of
this
scope.
so--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--yes,
i
believe
the
latter,
your
honor,
because
they
indicated
that...
they
talked
about
the
cost
of
auditing
all
of
the
records
of
non...
allegedly
non-covered
employees.
the
decision
itself
would
be
imprudent
and
a
waste
of
fund
assets
to
even
embark
on
such
an
audit.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
your
honor,
very
definitely.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
we
would
use
and
have
used,
your
honor,
what
we
call
our
field
audit
program,
and
it
is
in-house
fund
employees
who
are
now
trained
as
certified
public
accountants
who
specialize
in
doing
audits.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
well,
employed
by
the--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--well,
your
honor,
we
are
the...
have
ultimate
fiduciary
responsibility
under
erisa.
it's
a
non-delegable
duty.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
big
eight
accounting
firms
are
not
honorable
organizations,
but
remember,
we
have
over
12,000
contributing
employers
covering
a
half
a
million
participants.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
well,
your
honor,
they're
not
all
arthur
youngs
or
arthur
andersons,
and
we
have
companies,
a
small
company
in
keokuk,
iowa,
for
example,
and
he
may
have...
he
might
be
a
small,
what
we
fondly
refer
to
as
a
mom
and
pop
operation,
and
they
may
have
10
or
15
employees
and--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--yes,
your
honor,
but
we
are
under
erisa,
302(c)(5)
and
amex
coal
totally
separate
from
the
union,
and
we
have
a
fiduciary
duty
where
the
union
does
not.
and
we
believe
that
we
have
the
right
under
our
trust
agreement,
because
it
says
the
agents
and
representatives
as
designated
by
the
trustee
shall
have
the
right
to
perform
an
on
site
audit.
and
there's
another
practical
question,
justice
white,
that
i'd
like
to
address
from
your
question,
and
that's
one
of
cost.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
when
we...
to
hire
a
big
eight
accounting
firm
is
fine
for
people
that
can
afford
it.
on
the
other
hand,
my--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--well,
we...
we
think,
your
honor,
that
as
suggested
by
the
amicus
brief,
i
believe
of
deloitte
haskins
&
sells,
they
said
have
arthur
young
give
us
a
special
report
and
objective
of
what
they
want
done,
and
then
we
will
do
it
and
give
the
report
to
arthur...
arthur
young.
someone's
going
to
have
to
pay
for
that,
and
under
the
trust
agreement
now,
when
we
do
audits
of
employers,
the
fund
absorbs
the
cost,
unless
there
is
found
to
be
great
delinquencies
and
points...
excuse
me...
points
where
there
really
are
significant
audit
findings.
in
any
event,
after
the
$268--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--it
isn't,
your
honor.
it
was
in
prosser
and
schneider,
and
it's
article
10,
which
is
the
amendment
powers.
and
it
may
not
be
in
this
particular
case.
it
was
in
prosser
and
schneider.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
oh,
no.
no,
your
honor.
it's...
it's
the
contribution
obligation
is
determined
by
the
parties.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
that's
correct.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
and
the
scope
of
our
inquiry
when
we
do
an
audit,
and
i--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--yes,
they
have
the
power
to
do
that,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--well,
as
i
tried
to
explain--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--the
sixth
circuit...
we
are
absolutely
dead
in
the
water
because...
we
believe,
because
of
the
sixth
circuit
ruling,
because
they
not
only
say
must
you
have
particularized
costs,
that
it
would
be
imprudent,
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
even
attempt
an
audit
of
this
magnitude.
and
that's
the
key
point
that
i
wanted
to
stress
for
the
court,
but
i
see
my
time
is
flashing
here,
is
this:
the
scope
of
our
audit
is
a
very
limited
inquiry.
as
to
the
allegedly
non-covered
employees,
the
employees
that
the
employer
does
not
admit
liability
to,
all
we
want
to
do
is
establish
that
that
employee
is
not
doing
collective
bargaining
agreement
work.
that's
all
we
want.
we
don't
need
test
scores.
we
don't
need
medical
records,
things
that
are
characterized
as
sensitive.
what
we
do
need
is,
for
example,
we
need
to
know
as
a
basic
tie-in
document,
we
need
to
see
the
941,
and
we
need...
the
irs
form
941,
and
the
complete
payroll
register
of
an
employer.
why
do
we
need
that?
because
they
both
have
to
match,
because
if
they
don't
match,
that
means
that
there's
possibly
a
ghost
payroll
out
there,
and
there
could
be
employees
that
are
not
being
reported
upon
and
being
reported
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
no,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
no,
your
honor,
we're
saying...
yes.
it
depends
what's
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
because
of
our
size
and--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--yes,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
because
of
our
particular
plan,
and
the
scope
of
our
operation,
and
the
multiple
12,000
employers
and
all
of
the
people
that
we
have
strung
out
over
40
states
that
it
is
reasonable
for
us
to
do
it,
and
besides
that
we
have
a
right
under
the
trust
agreement
to
do
it.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
would
be
something
that...
i'm
not
ducking
the
question.
i
know
that
the
solicitor
general
is
going
to
ask
that.
but,
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
and
i
see
my
time
is
up
here,
and
i'd
like
to
save
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
that's
all
right.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court:
first
off,
i'd
like
to
correct
mr.
moran.
the
contract
in
prosser
and
schneider
that
was
before
this
court
was
not
the
same
contract
in
this
case.
it
was
the
greater
moving
and
storage
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
st.
louis,
and
that's
a
fact
that's
in
the
appendix
and
is
part
of
the
record.
the
contract
in
this
case
is
the
national
master
freight.
they're
totally
different
contracts.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
they
have
authority
under
the
national
master
freight
agreement.
they
have
access
to
the
contract.
they
have
not
as
of
this
date--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--we...
we
have
the
right
to
do
that
under
the
contract.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
your
honor,
if...
if...
if
the
trustees
accept
to
do
that.
it
has
not
presented
itself
yet.
the
trustees
cannot
be
forced
to
do
that
because
it's--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--yes,
that's
correct.
your
honor,
there
was
a
couple
of
things
that
i
would
like
to
say.
number
one,
the
bottom
line
is
the
transport
is
saying
you
have
to
take
our
word
for
it,
absent
reasonable
cause,
because
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit
said.
the
adequate
protections
that
you
have
is
the
union.
well,
as
this
court
examined
in
prosser
and
schneider,
the
union
may
not
be
reliable
in
this
context.
why?
because
the
buck
doesn't
stop
with
them;
it
stops
with
us.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
our
interests
do
not
always
converge.
we
have
fiduciary
responsibilities.
they
don't
have
any
responsibility
to
retirees
and
their
families;
we
do.
and
as
i
said
at
the
top
of
my
argument,
that
under
erisa
and
under
the
law
as
interpreted
by
the
department
of
labor,
that
if
an
employee
performs
work
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
fund
is
liable
to
provide
him
with
pension
credits
regardless
of
whether
or
not
that
employer
ever
paid
us
a
nickel.
now,
congress
made
us
the
fiduciaries
and
gave
us
the
responsibility
to
maintain,
preserve
and
protect
the
assets
of
that
fund,
and
we
submit
to
this
court
that
not
only
erisa
but
our
trust
agreements
does
not
require
us
to
simply
take
someone's
word
for
it.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
now,
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--they
don't
have
a
fiduciary
duty,
your
honor.
they
have
a
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
well,
i...
i
really
don't
think
it's
quite
that
close,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
they
have
a
duty,
but--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--pardon?
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
sure,
but
they
also
have
the
barrentine-arkansas-best
rationale
if
they
want
to
act
on
the
pejoratarian
principles.
they
are
not
committing
a
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation.
and
there
can
be
practical
situations--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--they...
yes,
they
could
be
committing
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
well,
your
honor,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
union's
not
in
an
informational
position
to
always
know
this.
everyone
seems
to
think
that
they
are,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
they're
not.
as
we
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--if
they're
doing
their
job,
but
they
don't
always
do
their
job,
your
honor.
and
we're
talking
about
a
huge
fund
here
with
a
lot
of
local--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--yes,
your
honor.
we
have
a
situation
where
we
go
out
and
do
an
audit,
and
this
is
the
second
case
where
an
employer
has
said
you
cannot
see
records,
only
those
that
we
concede
are
covered.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
your
honor,
we
have.
for
example,
we
had
a
footnoted
case...
not
the
case,
but
we
footnoted...
over
$300,000
in
casual
contributions
were
not
reported.
and
may
i
say--
