justice
o'connor
mr.
luplow,
i
take
it
that
employees,
covered
employees
are
required
to
join
the
union.
justice
o'connor
what
limits
do
you
think
erisa
may
impose
on
the
scope
or
frequency
of
audits
if
your
view
prevails?
justice
o'connor
do
we
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
mr.
luplow,
i
take
it
you're
not
encouraging
us
to
say
that
the
trustees
must
conduct
these
audits.
justice
o'connor
i
notice
you're
being
very
careful
to
avoid
that
kind
of--
justice
o'connor
--is
that
why
you're
not
relying
on
section
1059(a)(1)
in
making
your
argument?
justice
o'connor
but
i
guess
1059
could
be
read
to
require
employers
to
keep
these
records.
justice
o'connor
but
it
is
true
under
erisa
generally
that
you
could
have
people
who
were
not
union
members,
but
nevertheless
employees
participating
in
plan.
justice
o'connor
right.
and
for
that
reason,
as
we
interpret
erisa,
it's
logical
that
we
couldn't
rely
on
the
union's
efforts
to
see
to
it
that
contributions
are
made
to
everyone,
because
the
union
wouldn't
have
a
lot
of
interest
in
someone
who
wasn't
a
union
member,
presumably.
and
yet,
the...
the
fund
and
the
safety
of
the
fund's
investments
to
cover
potential
eventual
retirements
would
depend
on
collecting
for
everyone
who's
in
fact
a
participant.
justice
o'connor
but
in
interpreting
erisa,
if
we
get
that
far
in
the
case,
we
would
have
to
be
careful
about
our
rationale
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
might
include
employees
who
aren't
union
members,
isn't
that
so?
justice
o'connor
why
do
you
suppose
section
1059
requires
the
employer
to
maintain
records
for
all
employees,
not
only
plan
participants?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
deals
with
a
requirement
that
the
employer
maintain
records,
and
that
indicates
to
me
maybe
a
broader
concern
than
you
are
expressing.
justice
o'connor
mr.
moran,
suppose
we
disagree
with
the
sixth
circuit
holding.
aren't
other
forms
of
protective
orders
available
to
an
employer
to
provide
some
protection
such
as
the
kind
of
protective
order
that
was
issued
by
the
district
court
in
that
central
states
case
attached
to
the
petition
appendix?
aren't
there
other
forms
of
protection
besides
the
kind
of
holding
that
the
sixth
circuit
imposed
here?
justice
o'connor
now,
the
requests
aren't
coming
from
the
union.
i
understood
they
were
coming
from
the
trustees
at
the
pension
plans,
not
the
unions.
justice
o'connor
for
six
years?
i
mean
they've
asked
for
every
piece
of
paper
generated
in
the
companies
for
six
years,
is
that
what
you're
telling
me?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
moran,
the
whole
nature
of
an
audit
by
an
accountant,
though,
is
not
something
that's
done
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
cause
normally.
it's
something
that
an
accountant
will
go
in
and
look
at
to
determine
after
looking
at
it
whether
there's
a
problem.
and
i...
i
just
wonder
whether
this
sixth
circuit
requirement
can
legitimately
be
found
on
the
basis
of
either
the
statute
or
the
trust
agreement
here.
justice
o'connor
and
whether
we
don't
have
to
look
to
something
else.
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
talk
about
that
a
minute.
the
trust
agreement
provides
that
the
trustees
may
interpret
its
terms
and
that
the
parties
are
bound
by
that
interpretation
if
it's
made
in
good
faith.
and
if
the
trustees
of
a
trust
say
under
the
terms
of
the
trust
we
think
it
gives
us
the
right
to
make
the
audit,
why
aren't
you
bound?
justice
o'connor
certainly
not,
but
what
they're
asking,
of
course,
is
not
that
at
all,
but
the
right
to
look
at
the
records
to
make
sure
that
those
people
who
are
obviously
covered
have
the
contributions
made
to
fund
the
coverage.
