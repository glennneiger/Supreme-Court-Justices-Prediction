justice
white
what
do
you
mean,
$268,000?
justice
white
well,
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know,
what
you
were
referring
to.
justice
white
thanks.
justice
white
well,
doesn't
erisa
say
that
the
trustees
shall
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
documents
and
instruments
governing
the
plan
insofar
as
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
erisa?
justice
white
and
you
think
that...
you
think
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
erisa
for
the
trustees
to
obey
a
collective
bargaining
contract
that
says
expressly
that
the
employer
may
only...
need
only
give
a
list
of
covered
employees?
justice
white
well,
if
we
agree
with
you,
we
never
reach
erisa.
i
mean
we
just
say
that
as
a
matter
of
contract
the
employer
should
have
given
you
this
information.
justice
white
and
then
we
needn't
interpret
erisa
at
all.
justice
white
but
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
contract
and
agree
with
the
court
below
on
the
contract,
then
we
must
get
to
this
question.
justice
white
i
take
it
that
you
would
use
accountants
to
do
the
audit
spot
check?
justice
white
why
wouldn't
you
be
satisfied
with
a
certificate
of
an
independent
auditor
employed
by
the
employer?
justice
white
everybody...
every
other
agency
in
the
government
is
satisfied
with
a
certificate
of...
the
sec
is.
why
are...
why
do
you
need
to
do
it
yourself
rather
than
let
the
employer
hire
an
independent
auditor,
like
some
of
these
people
who
have
filed
amicus
briefs,
to
do
their
audit
and
give
you
a
certificate?
justice
white
you
say
it's
a
prudent
man
who
distrusts
the
audit
of
a
nationally
recognized
firm?
justice
white
well,
they
might
have
12,000
accountants.
justice
white
well,
the
employer
could
always
have
a
choice.
if
he
thought
it
was
too
expensive;
he'd
let
you
come
in.
justice
white
--mr....
mr.
schwartz,
you,
a
while
ago
before
you
were
questioned,
you
ended
up
saying
that...
did
you
say
that
you
do
not
agree
that
the
case
could
be
decided
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
white
only
on...
only
if
we...
only
if
we
agree
with
you
on
what
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
means.
justice
white
i
mean
trust,
yes,
yes.
justice
white
but
if
we...
if
we
disagree
with
that...
if
we
agree
with
the
court
below
that
the
trust
agreement
does
not
provide
for
this
audit,
then
you
must
get
to
the
statute.
justice
white
well,
do
you...
do
you...
do
you...
is
part
of
your
submission
that
the
contract...
that
the
trust
agreement
does
provide
for
the
audit,
or...
or
have
you
taken
a
position
on
that?
justice
white
if
we
didn't
agree...
if
we
didn't
agree
with
you
on
the
contract,
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague
on
your
side
that
the
employer
could
not
satisfy
his
erisa
obligations
by
having
an
independent
auditor
give
a
certificate
with
respect
to
all
of
his
employees?
justice
white
well,
here's
a
national
firm
that
comes
into
a
big
employer
and
gives
a
certificate,
and
it
goes
through
the
same
procedures
as
the
trustees
would.
and
it
would
not
be...
you
think
the
statute
requires
the
trustees
to
reject
that
certificate--
justice
white
--and
do
one...
and
do
one
of
its
own?
justice
white
it
doesn't
sound
very
sensible,
but
maybe
that's
why
it
says--
justice
white
--well,
that
isn't
what
i
asked.
justice
white
but
is
that
with
respect
to
every
single...
is
that
true
of
every
single
employer
who's
covered
by
this
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
white
well,
then,
you...
you're
just
representing
one
company,
aren't
you?
justice
white
and
that...
and
that
group
all
are
closed
shops.
justice
white
but
that
is
not
true
of...
of
a
lot
of
the
other
participants
or
companies
that
contribute
to
the
fund?
justice
white
but
nevertheless,
you...
your
case,
the
only
thing
that's
before
us
are
16
closed
shop
companies.
justice
white
you'd
never
be
able
to
get
to
your
own
books,
would
you?
justice
white
well,
how
do
you
propose
to...
to...
i
take
it
you
say
that
the
employer's
word
should
be
taken
as
final?
justice
white
well,
what...
what
should
he
furnish
to
the
trustees?
justice
white
and
in
your...
and
in
your
case
you
say
that...
you
say
that
the
only
people
who
are
covered
by
this
particular
plan
are
members
of
the
teamsters
union?
justice
white
and
the...
so
the...
and
the
union,
therefore,
has
a
list
of
its
own
members.
justice
white
thirty
days.
justice
white
your
15
percent
attrition.
justice
white
well,
it
probably...
we
probably
should
only
decide
the
case
we've
got
before
us
and
not
talk
about
a
lot
of
other
cases
that
may
have
different
facts.
it
may
be
that
in
some...
some
other
areas
there
won't...
there
won't
be
closed
shops.
justice
white
you
have
16...
you've
got
16
companies,
all
closed
shops.
justice
white
well,
that
answers
justice
stevens.
it
may,
anyway.
justice
white
well,
you
don't...
you
don't
think
it's
even
necessary
to
furnish
such
a
certificate?
justice
white
you
think
the...
you
think
the
union
in...
in
these
16
companies,
the
union
list
with
the
additions
and
subtractions
that
the
employer
makes
is
all
the
employer
has
to
do.
justice
white
what
makes
you
think...
what
makes...
where
do
you
find
the
authority
of
the
trustee
to
insist
on
looking
at
records
of
an
individual
that
you
would
agree
there's
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
there
should
be
an
investigation?
does
erisa
put
that
duty
on
you
in
that
case?
justice
white
does
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
put
that
duty
on
you?
justice
white
well,
so...
so
you...
so
you
really
don't
defend
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
know
where
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
authority
either.
it
didn't
say,
did
it?
justice
white
and
you
disagree
with
that.
justice
white
all
right.
so
you
disagree
wit
that,
so
you
do
not
defend
that
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
even
though
you'll
comply
with
it.
as
a
matter
of
law
you
don't
really
defend
that.
justice
white
that
is
a...
is
a
correct
statement.
justice
white
who
do
they
start...
who
do
they
have
a
grievance
with?
justice
white
do
they
have
a
grievance
with
the
employer?
justice
white
so
where
does
the
grievance
end
up?
does
that...
do
they
have
to
use
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
machinery?
justice
white
to
the
joint
board?
is
there
a
joint
board?
justice
white
uh-huh.
justice
white
does
it...
do
the...
do
the
trustees
have...
have
authority
to--
justice
white
--well,
do
you
have...
you
may
start
a
grievance.
justice
white
and
demand
arbitration
if
your
grievance
is
rejected.
justice
white
sure.
you
can
just
come
into
court.
justice
white
they
can
get
sued
in
court
for
breaking
it.
justice
white
they
can
get
sued
in
court
for
breaking
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
what...
what
brought
this
case
on
at
this
late
date?
i
shouldn't
say
late
date,
but
what
brought
this
case
on...
your
experience
with
omitted
employees
in
closed
shop
companies
or
what?
