mr.
patrick
a.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
by
what
authority
do
these
trustees,
these
taft-hartley
funds,
find
the
power
do
investigate
records
of
employees
that
the
union
and
the
employer
have
together
determined
are
not
doing
collective
bargaining
unit
work.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question
in
two
parts,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
union
we're
discussing
here
is
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters,
which
has
been
extremely
aggressive
in
its
membership
drives,
and
once
they
establish
that
a
person
is
doing
bargaining
unit
work
and
is
a
member,
they
have
been
extremely
aggressive,
your
honor,
in
making
sure
that
the
employers
remit
all
funds
that
are
necessary
in
the
form
of
compensation
and
payment
of
fringe
benefits.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
i...
i
don't
follow
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
the
corruption
in
the
trust
funds
of
these
funds,
your
honor,
has
been
the
subject
of
some
litigation
launched
by
the
department
of
labor
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
federal
court,
and
as
a
result
of
allegations
of
gross
mismanagement,
these
very
funds
have
given,
by
their
consent
judgment,
their
investment
and
management
funds,
or
powers
rather,
to
an
independent
investment
manager.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
allegations
that
deal
with
our
client
or
with
the
teamsters
union
or
locals
with
which
we
deal
of
any
misuse
of
funds
by
that
union.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
congress
was
trying
to
pass
in
erisa,
your
honor,
to
make
sure
that
if
an
employer
gives
fringe
benefit
funds
to
his
employees,
that
all
employees
would
be
eligible
to
participate
in
that
fund.
but
congress
did
not
say
to
the
employers
that
if
you
employ
or
have
more
than
one
fund,
each
of
your
employees
must
be
a
participant
in
each
of
your
funds.
not
at
all.
congress
allowed
certain
discriminations,
certain
characteristics
of
employment
that
would
allow
one
employee
to
be
a
member
of
one
pension
fund
and
another
employee
of
the
same
employer
to
be
a
member
of
a
different
pension
fund.
the
complement
of
employers...
of
employees,
rather,
that
central
transport
has
is
made
up
of
three
broad
categories.
the
first
are
those
who
are
members
of
the
teamsters
union
who
operate
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
central
states
fund
and
are
participants
in
that
fund.
the
second
are
members
of
the
teamsters
union
that
operate
in
a
different
geographic
area
of
the
country
and
are
participants
in
a
different
taft-hartley
fund.
also
within
that
second
group
are
members
of
other
unions
like
the
international
association
of
machinists,
which
have
a
separate
taft-hartley
plan.
and
finally,
there
are
those
employees
who
are
not
members
of
any
union
who
can
qualify,
if
they
meet
the
definition
of
erisa
participant,
to
be
a
participant
in
the
employer-sponsored
pension
fund
that
is
maintained
by
central
transport.
justice
o'connor
asked
a
question
earlier,
followed
up
by
mr.
justice
brennan:
must
a
person
be
a
member
of
the
union
to
be
a
participant
in
these
funds?
and
i
think
the
answer
was
given
that
no,
these
funds
represent
a
broad
spectrum
of
participants,
and
not
all
participants
have
to
be
members
of
the
union.
but
that's
not
the
facts
in
this
case.
central
transport
is
a
closed
shop.
to
do
a
bargaining
unit
work
in
central
transport,
you
must
be
a
member
of
the
teamsters
union
within
30
days.
that's
covered
quite
clearly
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that's
the
deal.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
in
a
plan.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
the
question
or
the
comment,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
points
to
a
difficulty
in
this
court
attempting
to
make
a
broad
sweep
of
authority
to
taft-hartley
trustees
in
general.
in
the
case
at
bar,
to
be
a
participant
in
the
central
states
fund,
the
employee
of
central
transport
must
be
a
member
of
the
union.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
i
am
told
by
the
funds
that
that
is
not
true
because
they
operate
in
right-to-work
states.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that's...
i
am
representing
a
group
of
16
companies
that
all
operate
in
the
same
geographic
area.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
absolutely.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
i
am
told
that
that
is
not
true
by
the
petitioners,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
o'connor.
and
that's
the
very
reason
that
this
court
should
not
embark
upon
attempting
to
find
implied
in
erisa
that
which
is
not
there.
if
congress
wished
to
give
a
power
to
the
trustees,
congress
knows
how
to
express
its
purpose.
section
1104
of
code...
of
title
29,
which
sets
forth
the
duties
and
obligations
of
these
trustees,
has
no
mention
of
the
power
to
audit
nonparticipants.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
because,
justice
o'connor,
1059
is
dealing
with
the
erisa
definition
of
employee,
which
is
found
at
1002(6).
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
if
i
may,
your
honor,
within
the
definition
of
employee
as
stated
by
erisa
are
several
components.
the
employees
of
central
transport
who
can
qualify
for
participation
in
this
plan
are
only
one
portion
of
that
total
component
of
employee
definition.
and
we
agree
full
well
that
the
definition
of
employee
in
erisa
is
much
broader
than
the
definition
of
employee
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
therein
lies
our
controversy.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
the
trustees
may
audit
the
records
of
all
employees
who
are
members
of
the
union
and
are--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--yes,
sir.
who
are
doing
bargaining
unit
work.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
if
i
may--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--central
transport
has
a
number
of
different
employee
groups.
some
of
them
are
teamsters,
and
some
of
those
teamsters
operate
in
a
geographic
area
represented
by
these
funds.
some
of
them
are
teamsters
and
do
not
operate
in
a
geographic
area
represented
by
these
funds.
just
taking
those
two
components,
these
trustees
clearly
have
the
right
to
review
the
records
of
teamsters
who
are
operating
within
their
geographic
area,
and
they
have
done
so,
and
they
did
so
for
60
days.
but
they
don't
have
the
right
to
review
the
records
of
employees
who
are
not
a
member
of
the
teamsters
union
and
are
not
within
this
geographic
area.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
no,
it
does
not.
in
fact,
therein
lies
the
rub
in
this
case.
if
the
trustees
are
correct
that
they
have
a
power
that
is
found
not
only
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
in
erisa,
implied
in
erisa,
to
see
the
records
of
all
employees,
then
the
trustees
of
every
pension
plan
to
which
central
transport
makes
contributions
have
a
concomitant
right.
and
this
is
not
an
imagined
danger.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
absolutely
not,
justice
white.
they'd
be
gone
all
the
time.
and
this
is
not
an
imagined
problem.
we
have
received
a
demand
from
the
new
york
state
teamsters
fund,
an
entirely
different
fund
than
the
fund
that's
here
today,
demanding
the
exact
same
records
in
quad
states
leasing,
one
of
the
defendant
companies.
and
when
we
told
them
they
weren't
entitled
to
those
records,
they
weren't
even
limited
geographically,
they
said
by
letter
to
us
then
the
result
is
we
will
kick
you
and
all
of
your
participants
out
of
our
fund.
they're
using...
they're
using
their
very
participants
in...
in
pawns
for
self-aggrandizement
and
increase
in
their
own
size.
that's
not
intended
by
erisa.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
certainly
our
federal
courts
could,
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
issue
protective
orders
as
the
justice
suggests;
but
i
don't
want
it
to
go
unmentioned
that
the
attempt
of
the
funds
to
indicate
that
they
are
just
asking
for
a
reasonable
amount
of
records
that
are
directed
to
particular
employees
should
go
unnoted.
for
instance,
they
have
asked
for
all
freight
bills,
delivery
receipts
and
bills
of
lading.
now,
these
are
three
documents
that
are
produced
by
a
trucking
company
for
every
piece
of
freight
they
haul.
central
transport
has
60,000
a
week
of
each
of
those
three,
or
180,000
per
week.
they
asked
for
equipment
control
requests;
that's
35,000
a
week.
activity
reports,
that's
35,000
a
week.
employee
records.
now,
just
on
those
four
things,
267,000
pieces
of
paper
a
week
times
52
weeks
are
13,900,000
pieces
of
paper
per
year
over
a
six-year
period...
now,
times
six
for
their
statute
of
limitations...
and
that
we
have
to
prepare,
maintain
and
produce
for
every
trustee
of
every
taft-hartley
plan
to
which
we
contribute.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
they
even
ask
for
every
secretarial
job.
they
even
ask
for
the
president's
records
of
the
company.
it's
absurd.
the
new
york
state
teamsters--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--fortunately,
i'm
not
in-house
counsel.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that's
correct.
they're
coming
from
trustees
of
the
pension
plans.
and
to
give
an
example
to
the
court,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
notation,
new
york
state
teamsters
represent
100
of
our
total
complement
of
9,000
employees,
and
they've
asked
for
the
records
of
all
9,000
employees.
now,
with--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--the
new
york
state
teamsters
have
asked
for
every
employee
record,
every
personnel
record
that
we
have
for
their
particular
audit
period,
and
they
noted
that
if
they
find
deficiencies,
they'll
ask
for
the
entire
six
years.
now,
that's
just
9,000
employees
we
have
today.
we
have
an
attrition
rate
of
15
percent,
so
double
the
number.
now
we
have
18,000
records--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--if
i
said
that,
i
misspoke.
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
i
am
totally
unaware
of
what
their
position
is,
totally
unaware.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
absolutely
not,
justice...
justice
white.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
first,
to
place
my
comments
in
context,
it
is
not
a
unilateral
determination
by
the
employer.
the
union
first
determines
who's
doing
bargaining
unit
work
and
prepares
a
list
which
is
sent
to
the
employer.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
a
union
has
a
list
of
its
own
members.
they
send
us
the
list.
we,
the
employer,
add
to
that
list
any
employees
who
have
been
hired
within
the
last
30-day
period--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--and
delete
from
that
list
any
employees
who
have
terminated.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that's
the
15
percent
attrition.
that
list
is
placed
upon
a
form
for
the
trustees,
and
those
names,
along
with
the
check,
goes
into
them
like
clockwork
every
30
days.
if
someone
is
left
out,
the
union
will
know
it
within
30
days.
it
is
not
a
unilateral
determination.
but
i
haven't
answered
the
question
of
the
court
yet.
what
we
wish
to
prevent
is
a
fishing
expedition
by
funds
across
the
country
in
all
of
our
records,
because
that
will
result
in
such
a
cost
to
employers
that
the
purposes,
the
lofty
objectives
of
erisa
that
congress
set
forth,
will
be
totally
lost
by
cost.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that's
correct.
the
case
before
us,
your
honor,
has...
has
many
protections
for
an
employees
not--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--that
is
correct.
the
case
in...
in
front
of
the
court
today
has
very
little
chance
that
someone
will
be
left
out
intentionally.
the
union
will
monitor
their
employment
and
make
sure
that...
that
this
person
is
part
of
the
union
and
receives
all
of
his
union
benefits.
and
besides,
we're
not
talking
just
about
pensions
here.
we're
talking
about
health
and
welfare.
and
you
don't
go
very
far
in
today's
society
without
finding
out
if
you
have
medical
coverage.
the
knowledge
of
the
shop
is
such
that
the
man
in
machine
number
one
or
truck
number
one
knows
very
well
if
he
doesn't
get
the
same
benefits
as
the
man
at
machine
number
two
or
truck
number
two.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
absolutely,
your
honor.
i'll
address
justice
white
first,
if
i
may.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
fine.
justice
stevens,
the
answer
to
your
question
would
be
within
the
definition
of
reasonable
cause,
or
whatever
this
court
might
wish
to
call
this
sort
of
a
balancing,
if
an
employee
would
come
to
the
trustee
and
say
i
think
i'm
doing
bargaining
unit
work,
and
the
union
won't
find
out
for
me,
and
i
don't
think
i
have
the
money
to
go
to
federal
court,
will
you
help
me
out,
the
trustee
then
should
have
reasonable
cause
to
come
forward
and
see
these
records,
and
the
employer
no
longer
has
the
concern
of
giving--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--i
have
no
problem
with
these
trustees
seeing
the
records
of
employees
for
which...
for
whom
they
have
reasonable
cause
to
suspect
are
doing
bargaining
unit
work
and
have
been
left
out
of
this
fund.
our
concern
is
that
we
may
face
liability
to
employees
if
we
give
out
their
confidential
records,
their
personnel
records
with
their
wages
and
work
history,
without
their
authority
to
do
so.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
if
the
trustees
attempt
to
redefine
the
collective
bargaining
unit,
i
believe
they
have
invaded
the
province
of
the
union.
if
instead
they
say
we
have
these
particular
people,
and
by
our
description
of
what
they
do,
we
think
they
are
part
of
the
union,
then
if
there's
reasonable
cause
to
say
that,
there's
no
reason
they
shouldn't
see
those
records.
the
schneider
case
or
prosser
case
last
term
said
trustees...
in
fact,
these
very
trustees...
you
have
the
right
to
come
to
federal
court,
and
now
they're
here.
but
when
they're
here,
they...
they
come
with
the
same
rights
and
obligations
of
any
litigant,
and
those
obligations
are
very
few,
but
they're
well
defined.
they
must--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--it
is
not--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--with
all
respect,
your
honor,
it
is
not
for
these
respondents,
the
employer,
to
justify
why
the
trustees
should
not
have
power.
it
is
for
the
trustees
to
say
wherein
their
power
lies.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
the
trustees
have
the
right
to
determine
within
the
confines
of
the
trust
agreement
on
matters
of
simple
administration,
trust
administration.
but
to
say
that
the
trustees
have
a
carte
blanche
to
bootstrap
coverage
to
anyone
they
want
is
not
what's
intended.
we
certainly...
the
employers
certainly
did
not
give
to
the
trustees
the
right
to
determine
who
are
participants
any
more
than
we
gave
them
the
right--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--yes,
your
honor,
but
other
trustees
say
they
have
the
same
duty.
and
in
the
new
york
state
teamsters
example,
if
these
trustees,
central
states,
assert
that
they
represent
as
a
participant,
they
have
as
a
participant
targeted
employee
jane
doe,
and
new
york
state
says
wait,
jane
doe
is
a
member
of
our
fund,
the
new
york
state
teamsters
trustees
have
the
came
concomitant
duty
to
try
and
keep
jane
doe
in
their
fund
as
these
trustees
have
to
try
and
wrest
her
away.
and
we
end
up
with
litigation
of
trustee
against
trustee
besides.
there
are
collective
bargaining
agreements
by
which
the
employer,
central
transport,
makes
its
contribution,
and
we
can
see
that
the
union's
not
here
today.
and
just
because
a
trustee
proves
that
a
targeted
employee
should
be
in
the
central
states
fund
doesn't
mean
that
the
new
york
state
teamsters
union...
not
the
fund
but
the
union...
is
going
to
agree
that
that
person
is
no
longer
part
of
their
bargaining
unit,
and
the
symmetry
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
taft-hartley
plan
is
completely
destroyed.
we
can
have
an
employee
who
receives
wages
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
fringe
benefit
contributions
under
a
second
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
to
the
employee
this
could
be
disastrous.
for
instance,
let
us
assume
an
employer
with
two
sets
of
employees,
one
under
union
a
and
one
under
union
b,
and
union
a
provides
for
total
benefits
per
week
of
$110,
as
does
union
b.
but
union
a
divides
them
differently:
$80
goes
to
wages,
$30
to
fringe
benefit
contributions.
the
union
a
employees
get
$100
of
wages
and
$10
of
fringe
benefit
contributions.
now
the
trustees
start
their
fight,
and
the
poor
pawn
of
the
employee
can
end
up
receiving
$80
in
wages
under
union
a
and
$10
in
contributions
of
fringe
benefits
under
plan
b
for
$90.
and
he
says
what
happened
to
me?
i'm
still
driving
a
truck.
that's
all
he
ever
did.
that's
not
intended
by
erisa,
and
the
problem
is
putting
in
context
the
definition
of
employee
and
erisa,
which
is
what
raised
the
initial
question
in
the
court's
mind.
we
admit
that
erisa's
definition
of
employee
is
much
broader
than...
excuse
me...
than
the
definition
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
it's
meant
to
be.
if
the
court
finds
that
these
trustees
and
all
taft-hartley
trustees
have
a
power
that's
found
in
the
law,
some
place
in
the
law,
although
erisa
does
not
expressly
give
it
to
them,
then
they've
had
it
at
least
since
1975...
not
since
they've
concocted
their
theory,
because
erisa's
fiduciary
standards
became
active
in
1975,
and
before
that...
these
are
taft-hartley
funds.
taft-hartley's
been
around
since
1947.
and
isn't
it
strange
that
in
1947's
hearings
in
congress,
in
1974's
hearings
for
the
erisa,
in
the
hearings
for
the
welfare
pension
plan
disclosure
act
that
preceded
erisa,
and
in
the
multi-employer
pension
plan
amendments
act
in
1980,
congress
never
said
these
trustees
have
the
power
they
say
congress
intended?
i
would
think
that
a
more
reasonable
resolution
of
that
puzzlement
is
that
congress
simply
did
not
intend
to
give
them
this
power.
justice
white
asked
the
question
why
couldn't
an
employer
use
his
own
auditor,
own
independent
certified
public
accountant
to
issue
a
report.
mr.
luplow
responded
that
it
would
be
too
costly.
but
the
employer
funds
the
cost
of
the
audit
that
the
funds
want
to
do,
so
the
answer
that
it's
too
costly
is...
simply
doesn't
hold
water.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
from...
from--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--that's
absolutely
correct.
i
started
to
answer
an
earlier
question
from
this
side
of
the
bench...
i
believe
mr.
justice
stevens...
concerning
how
do
you
find
these...
these
participants.
i
think
that
was
the
theme
at
least
of
the
question,
if
not
the
words.
a
participant
can
go
to
the
trustee
and
say
i'd
like
you
to
make
an
investigation,
and
the
trustee
then
doesn't
have
to
come
to
federal
court.
if
he
has
reasonable
cause,
we'll
give
him
the
records.
if
we
disagree--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--absolutely
not.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
absolutely
not.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
no.
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
find
that
authority
in
an
implication
in
erisa,
in
an
implication
in
the
collective
bargaining--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--i
disagree
that
the
federal
court
should
be
extending
a
federal
common
law
in
an
area
such--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--that
is
a
correct
statement.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that
is
a
correct
statement.
i
agree
with
you
that
i
don't
think
that
a
reasonable
cause
standard
is
necessary
in
this
case,
because
i
don't
think
there
is
a
power
under
the
contract,
i
don't
think
there's
a
power
under
erisa,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
should
give...
should
extend
federal
common
law
because
it's
simply
not
needed.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
that's
correct.
and
not
only
that,
your
honor,
they
can
start
a
grievance.
last
term
this
court
heard
the
schneider
case
or
prosser
case,
if
you
will,
on
this
very
collective
bargaining
agreement;
but
that
agreement
has
been
amended.
at
the
time
of
the
schneider
case,
argument
with
counsel
and
bench
concerned
what
would
happen
if
the
trustees
have
the
right
to
start
a
grievance,
arbitration
machinery,
and
they
do.
attached
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
on
the
merits
is
a
change
in
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
change
had
been
made
before
the
question
was
addressed
to
the
court
last
term.
be
that
as
it
may,
the
trustees
have
the
right
to
start
a
grievance.
they
have
the
right--
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
they
would
have
a
grievance
with
the
employer,
and
if
the
union
had
nothing
to
represent
an
employee
as...
as
was
the
fear
expressed
by
bench,
they
would
have
a
grievance
against
the
employer.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
it
says
they
should.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
yes.
to
a
joint
committee.
mr.
patrick
a.
moran
they
can
also
come
to
federal
court.
it
was
decided
in
schneider
they
can
do
so.
but
when
they
come
to
federal
court,
they
come
with
the
same
rules
as
every
litigant,
and
that's
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
they
do
not
give
the
right
to
a
federal
litigant
for
discovery
prior
to
stating
a
cause
of
action.
they
have
to
state
a
cause
of
action
that
they
have
a
reason
to
believe
that
these
records
are
sitting
out
there.
once
they
do
so,
they're
litigants.
thank
you.
