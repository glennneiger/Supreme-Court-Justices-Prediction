justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question,
mr.
luplow?
on
the
question
of
the
trustees'
power
to
amend
the
trust
documents,
you
said
they
had
unrestricted
power
of
amendment.
i
don't
find
that.
maybe
it's
not
in
the
papers.
justice
stevens
but
they
can...
can
they...
they
can't
amend
the
contribution
obligation,
can
they?
justice
stevens
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
stevens
but
the...
but
the...
and
the
or
the
coverage
of
what
kind
of
employee
they
have
to
contribute
on,
that's
also
defined
in
the
basic
agreement.
justice
stevens
but
you're
saying
they
have
the
power
to
amend
the
instrument...
say
it
was
ambiguous
now...
to
say,
lest
there
be
any
doubt
about
it,
we
have
the
right
to
audit
all
contributing
employers,
including
all
payroll
records
of
people
not
eligible
to
participate.
they
could
adopt
such
an
amendment?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
they
don't,
then.
justice
stevens
i
understand
you're
say
they're
afraid
because
of
what
the
sixth
circuit
said.
justice
stevens
mr.
moran,
let
me
interrupt,
if
i
may.
again,
you
said
the
new
york
teamsters.
you
meant
the
trustees
of
that
fund,
do
you
not?
justice
stevens
and
the
reason
i...
i
focus
on
that,
am
i
correct
in...
in
noting
that
the
teamsters
union
has
not
participated
in
this
litigation
at
any
stage,
as
an
amicus
brief
or
anything?
justice
stevens
they
say
it's
your
problem,
and
do
whatever
you
want.
they've
not
shown
their
interest
one
way
or
another.
justice
stevens
mr.
moran,
what...
that
prompts
this
question.
supposing
somebody
or
his
wife
or
somebody
thinks
he
ought
to
be
covered,
and
the
union
says
no,
and
the
company
says
no,
and
they
go
to
the
trustee
and
say
they're
just
not
contributing
on
my
behalf,
and
i
belong
in
this...
this
unit.
and
the
trustee
says
well,
we'll
investigate.
what
kind
of
an
investigation,
under
your
view,
could
the
trustees
make
on
such
a
set
of
facts?
well,
excuse
me.
i
was
just...
in
the
course
of
answering
his
question,
do
you
support
the
court
of
appeals
decision
with
respect
to
an
individual
employee
in
which
there's
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
or
something,
and
then
you
have
to
furnish
his
records?
justice
stevens
but
then
as
soon...
as
soon
as
you
admit
that,
what
about
this
case
again
where
they
allege
that
in
doing
a
proper
audit
they
found
a
half
a
dozen
cases
that
suggested
to
them
there
was
some
underreporting?
justice
stevens
well,
what
if
they
should
find
that,
say,
there
were
a
dozen
employees
that
were
casual,
some
would
work
for
short
periods
of
time
and
so
forth,
and
they
identify
a
problem
in
a
particular
area
of
the
company,
that
you
hire
certain
people
on
short
runs
or
something
like
that.
would
they
be
able
to
look
at
the
records
pertaining
to
that
narrower
group
of
employees?
justice
stevens
no,
but
i
would
think
the
trustees,
if
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
they
were
not
contributing
on
somebody,
they
could
file
a
lawsuit
against
the
company
and
say
pay
your
contribution
and
get
discovery.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
luplow--
justice
stevens
--isn't
it
a
practical
matter
that
the
union
also
has
the
fiduciary
obligation
to
be
sure
the
employees
are
included
within
the
beneficiaries?
justice
stevens
well,
it's
pretty
close
to
the
same
thing.
justice
stevens
at
least
they
have
a
duty.
justice
stevens
you
mean
if
they...
if
they...
if
they
fail
to...
knowingly
fail
to
include
some
people
in
the
list
that
was
submitted
that
they
would
not
be
committing
a
breach
of
duty?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
they
have
every
incentive
to
do
it,
too,
because
they
get
dues
out
of
these
people
when
they
join
their
union.
justice
stevens
well,
if
they're
doing
their
job,
they
know
what's
going
on.
justice
stevens
but
i'm
asking
you,
have
you
had
some
experience
where
in
closed
shop
situations
the
information
you
get
is
unreliable?
