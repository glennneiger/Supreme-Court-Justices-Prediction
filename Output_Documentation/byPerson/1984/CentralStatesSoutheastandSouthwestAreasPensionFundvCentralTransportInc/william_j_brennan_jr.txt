justice
jr.
well,
is
that...
is
it
a
subject
that
could
be
covered
completely
by
the
contracts?
justice
jr.
no
matter
what
the
contracts
may
provide?
justice
jr.
i
see.
justice
jr.
and
that
would
be
whether
the
obligations
under
4
are
more
or
less
than
the
contract
provides?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
one
last
question
while
you're
on
this
subject?
it's
pretty
difficult
to
amend
contracts
like
this,
is
it,
or
is
it?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
incidentally,
do
i...
do
i
gather
that
employees
are
covered
even
if
not
members
of
the
union,
if
they
are
doing
a
certain
kind
of
work
which
is
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
jr.
even
though
not
members
of
the
union.
justice
jr.
and
i
gather...
and
you
want
to
be...
i
gather
the
purpose
of
the
audit
is
to
be
sure
that
a
lot
of
employees
not
members
of
the
union
are
on
covered
work,
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
--mr.
schwartz,
whatever
may
be
the
procedure
by
which
it's
done,
suppose
there...
it's
found
that
given
work
is
covered
under
this
agreement,
but
it's
being
done
by
non-members
of
the
union,
and
the
employer
has
provided
a
pension
fund
for
those.
now,
may
there
be
an
audit,
and
if
it's
discovered
that
the
work
they're
doing
in
fact,
even
though
there's
a
pension
fund
for
them,
the
work
they're
doing
is
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
then
they
must
be
included?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
moran,
i'm
getting
a
little
confused.
these
are
all
closed
shops,
all
16
of
the
companies
you
represent
today?
justice
jr.
well,
surely
the
trustees
may
audit
the
records
of
all
of
those
employees,
may
it
not?
justice
jr.
who
are
covered
by
the
closed
shop.
justice
jr.
yes.
well,
then,
what
other
employees
are
there?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
well,
but
what
puzzled
me
was
if
it
were
a
closed
shop,
i
thought
it
covered
everybody,
but
it
doesn't.
justice
jr.
mr.
moran,
let
me
see
if
i
get
this.
if
you
had,
say,
machinists,
a
contract
doing...
covering
machinists
work,
and
you
had
a
pension,
machinists
pension
plan,
your
concern
is
that
the
machinists
will
want
to
examine
every
job
of
every
teamsters
employee
to
see
whether
in
fact
he's
doing
teamsters
work.
justice
jr.
and...
and
that's
what
you
say
the
teamsters
are
trying
to
do.
they
want
to
examine
every
machinist's
jobs
to
see
whether
in
fact
he's
doing
teamsters
work.
justice
jr.
--want
to
see
your
lawyer's
record
in
this.
