justice
white
well,
your
client
didn't
testify,
did
he?
justice
white
and
so
what's
the
violation
against
him?
justice
white
and
you
object
to
the
court
of
appeals
not
ruling
on
it?
justice
white
and
what
did
the
trial
court
do?
justice
white
well,
in
the
next
case,
i
suppose
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
a
trial
court
will
never
need
to
rule
on
the
motion
unless
he
says
he's
going
to
testify
and
gives
the
substance
of
his
testimony.
justice
white
the
court
of
appeals,
i
guess,
said
a
trial
judge
never
needs
to...
never
has
to
rule
or--
justice
white
--if
the
defendant
just
stays
off
the
stand--
justice
white
--there
is
never
going
to
be
a
ruling
on
his
motion.
justice
white
and
there
need
not
be
under
this
court
of
appeals
judgment.
justice
white
well,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
white
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here
if
the
district
court
hadn't
ruled
and
said
that
the
impeachment
would
be
admissible?
justice
white
yes.
but
what
if
he
hadn't?
what
if
he
had
said,
sorry,
but
i'm
just
not
going
to
rule
on
your
motion.
you
haven't
given
me
any
reason
to
rule
on
it.
i'm
just
not
going
to
rule
on
it
now.
you'll
just
have
to
take
your
chances
on
whether
you're
going
to
testify
or
not.
and
then
your
client
did
not
testify,
and
you
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
your
client
is
convicted.
and
then
in
the
court
of
appeals
you
say,
i
was
kept
off
the
stand
because
the
district
refused
to
rule,
and
that
left
me
with
the
threat
of
impeachment.
now,
would
you
be
making
that
argument,
or
do
you
think
that
this
is
a
unique
case
in
the
sense
that
the
district
court
did
rule
against
your?
justice
white
i
don't
think
the
courts
in
the
fifth
circuit--
justice
white
--yes.
are
going
to
rule
so
often
after
this.
justice
white
doesn't...
this
circuit
leaves
it
with
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge.
justice
white
i
know,
but
if
the
defendant
doesn't
testify,
he
just
doesn't
go
on
the
stand
because
he
doesn't
know
if
he
is
impeachment
will
be
offered
or
not.
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
say
whether
the
district
court
was
right
or
wrong
in
ruling
on
his
motion.
justice
white
and
he
says
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
ruled
on
it.
isn't
it
implicit
in
that
position
that
the
petitioner
is
insisting
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
his
ruling?
justice
white
well,
it
would
be
a
little
odd
to
come
all
the
way
here
and
say
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
ruled,
if
it
didn't
think
the
district
court
was
wrong.
justice
white
he
certainly
wouldn't
have
gotten
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
said
please
rule
on
this
motion,
even
though
it
was
rightly
ruled
on.
justice
white
in
the
court
of
appeals
view,
it
wouldn't
have
needed
to
rule,
even
if
he
had
said
he
was
going
to
testify,
and
even
if
he
had
told
them
what
he
was
going
to
testify
to.
justice
white
and
disagreed
with
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
respect.
justice
white
it
wouldn't
have
done
him
any
good
to
tell
them
what
he
was
going
to
testify
to.
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
it
would
be
error
for
the...
was
it
error
for
the
district
court,
or
unwise
for
the
district
court
to
rule
on
this
motion
at
all?
justice
white
but
how
can
it
make
a
sensible
ruling
until
he
goes
on
the
stand
and
then
the
impeachment
is
offered?
justice
white
if
the
trial
judge...
if
it's
sensible
for
the
trial
judge
to
rule
when
the
defendant
makes
that
kind
of
a
showing,
why
isn't
it
sensible
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
rule
on
whether
the
district
court
was
correct?
justice
white
what
if
the
district
court
listens
and
then
says,
i'll
tell
you,
young
man,
that
impeachment
evidence
is
admissible...
and
then
he
stays
off
the
stand.
now,
is
that
ever
reviewed?
justice
white
that's
this
case,
so
you
must
say
it's
never
reviewable.
justice
white
so
your
answer
is
that
it's
not
reviewable
if
he
stays
off
the
stand.
justice
white
so
we
don't
need
to
decide
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
ruling
as
it
did,
and
saying
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
he
had
made
the
showing.
here,
he
didn't
make
any
showing
at
all.
so
is
that
all
we
need
to
decide,
or
do
we
need
to
buy
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
decide
the
case?
justice
white
i
would
think
the
government,
then,
would
urge,
under
the
sixth
circuit
ruling,
would
certainly
urge
district
courts
not
to
rule
on
in
limine
motions
at
all;
that
you
just
wait
till
he...
let
him
decide
whether
he's
going
to
take
the
stand
or
not,
and
then
rule
on
the
evidence.
justice
white
well,
how
are
you
going
to...
how
are
you
going
to
react
to
motions
in
limine?
are
you
going
to
tell
the
judge
it's
discretionary,
but
we
urge
you
to
use
your
discretion
not
even
to
rule?
justice
white
if
the
defense
does
not
proffer
or
tender
what
evidence
a
defendant
will
give,
if
he's
allowed
to
testify
free
of
impeachment,
how
could
any
court
ever
review
it?
