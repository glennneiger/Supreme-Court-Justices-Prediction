mr.
james
i.
marcus
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
for
review
this
afternoon
is,
must
the
defendant
give
up
his
right
not
to
testify
in
order
to
preserve
his
right
to
appeal
an
erroneous
ruling
by
the
trial
court
admitting
a
prior
conviction
under
rule
609a
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence?
the
context
in
which
this
case
arose
is
by
way
of
a
motion
in
limine
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
memphis.
in
his
motion,
the
defendant
firmly
indicated
a
desire
to
testify
in
his
defense.
the
issue
was
briefed,
and
the
relevant
case
law
cited
to
the
court.
after
argument,
both
the
government
and
defendant
moved
for
a
ruling.
the
trial
court
definitively
held
that
a
defendant
may
testify
on
the
issue
of
flight,
absent
impeachment
by
way
of
the
prior
conviction.
however,
if
the
defendant
were
to
testify
on
any
substantive
issues
in
the
case,
the
evidence
of
the
prior
conviction
could
then
be
admitted
against
him.
the
rationale
behind
the
court's
ruling
was
simply
that
the
earlier
conviction,
first,
involved
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude,
and
secondly,
that
it
was
a
felony.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
he
did
not.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
the
ruling,
however,
was
definitive
before
the
conclusion
of
the
defense
case.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
after
the
defendant
was
convicted,
post-trial
motions
in
this
matter
once
again
raised
the
issue
of
the
earlier
conviction
being
improperly
admitted
as
impeachment.
and
again,
the
trial
court
ruled,
this
time
in
a
written
opinion,
that
the
previous
conviction
was
a
felony
involving
moral
turpitude,
and
therefore
would
be
proper
impeachment
in
this
case.
on
appeal,
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction,
stating
in
part
that,
since
the
defendant
had
failed
to
testify
and
suffered
the
impeachment,
he
could
not
now
complain
of
error.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
should
not
have
been
required
to
waive
his
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent
in
order
to
preserve
a
ruling
which
is
patently
wrong.
the
right
to
remain
silent
or
to
testify
is
a
fundamental
right
of
all
defendants.
it
is,
more
importantly,
a
personal
right
to
each
defendant.
it
would
stretch
the
doctrine
of
waiver
beyond
its
limits
to
suggest
that
a
defendant
faced
with
these
facts,
that
being
an
erroneous
ruling
of
the
trial
court,
a
ruling
which
certainly
will
impact
on
his
decision
whether
or
not
to
take
the
witness
stand
to
testify,
cannot--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
your
question.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
perhaps.
i
think--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--i
think
you
can.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--your
honor,
yes.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
purpose
in
the
rule
if
he
did
not
or
would
not
entertain
the
motion.
as
an
example,
the
rule
is
there
for
a
purpose.
rule
609a,
as
the
court
is
familiar
with,
is
there
for
a
purpose
and
i
believe
the
court
must
indeed
decide
at
some
point
in
time
certainly,
the
motion
in
limine
in
this
context.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
i
believe,
as
i
had
indicated
earlier,
that
it
should
be
decided.
i
think,
in
looking
to
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
which
we
submit
are
important
here,
the
court
did
rule
and
it
was
a
definite
ruling,
and
it
was
made
before
the
defendant
did
testify.
your
suggestion,
of
course,
raises
a
different...
or
perhaps
somewhat
different
issue
than
we
have
presented
here
today.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
changed
the
ruling
at
what
point
in
time
now?
if
you
are
suggesting
change
the
ruling
after
the
defendant
had
testified,
i
think--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--or
before
the
defendant
had
testified?
certainly,
any
court
can
reconsider
its
motion.
that's
done...
i
won't
say
routinely...
but
district
judges,
as
you
are
familiar
with,
do
from
time
to
time
reconsider
motions.
and
certainly
a
reconsideration
is
not
improper.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
absolutely,
your
honor.
it's
done
quite
frequently.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
in
this
case,
i
think
the
motion
itself,
in
looking
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
arose
at
the
last
possible
moment
prior
to
the
defendant's
testifying.
the
motion
was
filed
at
trial,
and
the
ruling
was
just
before
the
defendant
was
to
take
the
stand
during
the
course
of
the
defense
in
this
case.
so
indeed...
again,
looking
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
trial
court
had
all
the
information,
we
submit,
certainly
necessary
to
make
the
ruling
at
that
point,
and
indeed
it
was
the
last
possible
moment
for
him
to
rule,
prior
to
the
defendant
testifying,
of
course,--
indeed,
if
the
defendant
were
coerced
to
testify
and
relinquish
his
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent,
we
submit
this
would
be
fundamentally
unfair,
based
on
an
erroneous
ruling
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
no
testimony
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
the
violation
against
him,
we
submit,
is
that
the
ruling
was
indeed
improper.
the
court
did
not
apply
a
balancing
test,
as
mandated
by
the
federal
rule.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
the
trial
court,
at
the
time
of
the...
the
trial
court
indeed
did
rule
on
the
motion,
and
indeed
indicated
that
if
the
defendant
were
to
testify,
the
impeachment
could
be
admitted...
that
being
the
impeachment
by
way
of
prior
conviction.
we
submit
that
there
was
not
even
an
attempt
at
balancing
under
the
rule
609a
which
is
required,
and
the
court
ruled
patently
wrong
in
its
motion,
on
the
motion
in
limine.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
this
is
the
situation
that
was
presented
in
the
united
states
v.
cook.
the
court...
i
believe
in
our
motion,
this
is
somewhat
of
a
contention.
we
indicated
that
the
defendant
would
indeed
testify.
this
is
reflected
in
the
motion
itself.
there
was
an
accompanying
memorandum.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
i
believe
at
some
point
in
time,
clearly,
there's
a
rule
that
there
and
a
motion,
presumably,
that's
presented,
and
at
some
point
the
court
would
have
to
rule;
whether
it
be
before
the
defendant
testified
or
after
the
defendant
testified.
at
some
point
in
time
before
that
impeachment
was
admitted,
the
district
court
would
have
to
rule.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
stays
off
the
stand;
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
that
is
correct.
i
might
point
out,
although
i
will
address
this
a
little
later
in
my
argument.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
we
indicate
that
we
feel
it
is
coercive
on
a
defendant
not
to
have
that
ruling.
certainly,
the
most
significant
aspect
of
a
defense,
and
it's
well-recognized
by
this
court,
is
the
defendant's
own
testimony.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
i
think
in
this
unique
set
of
circumstances--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--unique...
the
fact
is
that
this
is
perhaps
the
most
devastating
impeachment
that
can
be
admitted
or
elicited
from
a
defendant.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
i
think
it's
singular
in
the
context
in
which
it
arose,
too.
we
did
have
a
ruling
here.
i
think
that's
different
than
other
cases
where
the
court
defers
ruling.
we
are
confronted
with
a
specific
ruling
here.
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
certainly
the
evidence
of
prior
conviction
is
the
singular
most
devastating--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--i
would
have
to
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
at
least
if
i
clarify
that.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
i
don't
think
it's
that
high.
and,
if
i
could,
your
honor,
i'm
speaking
simply
not
at
the
state
level,
but
merely
at
the
federal
level.
i
think...
it
has
been
my
experience
that
the
federal
prosecutions
often
involve
a
number
of
white
collar
criminals
who
often
times
don't
have
prior
convictions.
they
do
arise,
from
time
to
time
though,
in
other
situations,
more
violent
types
of
crimes,
bank
robberies
and
things
like
that,
where
prior
convictions
are
probable.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
are
you
saying
with
the...
i
think
the--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--i
would
have
to
agree
with
that
comment.
i
think
that
certainly
is
a
key
factor
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
defendant
will
testify,
is
whether
or
not
he
has
a
prior
conviction.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
i'm
sorry.
he
did
rule
and
did
say
it
was
admissible.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
i
think
that
district
courts
in
virtually
every
case
that
i
found,
and
every
case
certainly
that's
been
reported
that
i'm
aware
of,
the
district
court
does
rule.
i
think
district
judges--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--sixth
circuit.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
after
this.
his
honor
may
be
correct.
but
i
think
in
every
other
circuit
in
the
country,
there
is
a
procedure
in
which
review
is
granted.
this
circuit
in
this
decision
stands
alone.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
i
think
this
circuit
requires
at
some
point
in
time,
if
the
defendant
testifies,
the
court
does--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--that
certainly
would
leave
him
hanging
by
a
thread,
there
is
no
question.
we
also
suggest,
and
i
think
a
problem
which
did
confront
us
in
this
particular
case
to
a
lesser
extent,
is
advice
of
counsel.
what
if
the
lawyer
for
the
defendant
tells
his
client,
when
he
is
confronted
with
the
situation,
that
the
judge
may
or
may
not
allow
this
impeachment
in
against
you?
mr.
james
i.
marcus
i--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--i
don't
doubt
that,
certainly.
my
background,
it's
a
little
more
current
than
what
the
court
suggests.
and
i
do
feel,
though,
that
the
problem
that
is
confronted
by
counsel...
and
i
think
it
does
impact
to
some
extent
on
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
how
can
a
counsel
be
effective
and
advise
his
client
what
to
do
if
he
doesn't
know
whether
or
not
it's
a
specific
piece
of
evidence
that's
going
to
come
in?
mr.
james
i.
marcus
no.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
certainly,
i
think
in
this
particular
instance,
we
have
a
rule,
a
federal
rule
of
evidence
which
has
to
be
construed
at
some
point
in
time.
certainly
motions
in
limine
are
filed
to
attack
motions
to
suppress
certain
other
crucial
pieces
of
governmental
evidence.
it's
not
unknown.
again,
a
motion
to
suppress
is
not
the
same
as
a
motion
in
limine,
but
something
akin
to
it
certainly.
this
is
not
unheard
of.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
that's
true.
sometimes
you're
confronted
with
a
brand
new
district
court
judge.
this
is
not
the
case
in
this
situation.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
absolutely,
judge.
excuse
me...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
my
reasonings
being...
this
court,
i
am
aware,
is
the
author
the
gordon
decision
which
predates,
of
course,
the
federal
rule.
but
we
specifically
found
that
the
earlier
conviction
was
an
old
one.
it
was
eight
years
old.
the
rule
provides
for
ten.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
eight
years
old.
that
is
correct.
the
similarity
of
the
conviction
was
extremely
crucial
in
this
case.
it
was
a
drug-related
crime.
and
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
on
trial,
of
course,
for
a
cocaine
conspiracy.
so
the
similarity
of
the
conviction
was
significant.
we
also
found
that
the
defendant
had
no
subsequent
criminal
history,
or
i
should
say
no
conviction
subsequent
to
that
incident,
earlier
incident.
and
we
feel
that
the
factors
and
the
fact
also...
the
case
was,
we
submit,
weak
as
to
this
particular
defendant.
his
testimony
was
extremely
important.
the
facts
in
this
case
were
not
particularly
strong
as
to
the
defendant
luce.
we're
not
contesting,
as
the
solicitor
notes
in
his
brief,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
but
certainly
his
testimony
was
sufficient
or
was
important
in
this
case
and
was
indeed
extremely
significant.
the
effect
of
a
ruling
such
as
in
this
case,
which
was
not
in
any
way
tentative,
again
as
we
indicated,
but
rather
definitive,
on
a
specific
motion
to
limit
evidence
should
not
escape
review
merely
because
a
defendant
adjusts
his
trial
strategy
to
meet
the
court's
ruling.
the
defendant
took
the
judge
at
his
word.
the
court
ruled.
we
accepted
that
ruling
and
took
this
court
at
its
word.
there
was
not
any
indication
that
he
would
later
modify
his
ruling,
but
that
he
needed
more
information
to
make
his
ruling.
i
think
this
is
an
important
point.
the
court
felt
it
had
enough
information
at
that
point
to
make
its
ruling.
and
indeed,
under
the
terms
of
this
ruling,
which
again
we
submit
is
somewhat
significant,
it
would
not
have
mattered
what
the
defendant
said
on
direct
or
cross-examinations.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
i
think
it
speaks
of
probativeness.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
this
is
the
type
of
area
that
a
defendant
would
have
to
testify
in,
in
order
for
a
court
to
make
a
ruling.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
well,
again,
in
this
case,
the
district
court
did
not
feel
it
needed
that
information.
it
felt
it
had
sufficient
information
to
make
the
ruling,
absent
the
defendant's
testimony.
i
think
this
would
be,
again,
a
rather
harsh
rule
to
adopt,
for
this
court
to
adopt;
to,
first,
require
the
defendant,
as
the
sixth
court
of
appeals
does,
take
the
the
stand
and
wait
for
the
court's
ruling
until
the
cross-examination.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
again,
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
was
not
an
abstract
question.
the
district
court
did
not
need
more
information,
did
not
need
additional
matters
to
consider,
did
not
need
the
defendant's
testimony,
but
felt
it
had
all
the
information
necessary
to
make
the
ruling.
we
would
also
suggest
that
the
district
courts
rule
on
these
motions
routinely,
and
the
appellate
courts
review
them
routinely.
and
up
until
this
decision,
this
had
been
more
or
less
a
routine
matter.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
in
this
particular--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--i
believe
the
court
would
have
to
look
to
an
abusive
discretion
standard,
whether
or
not
the
court
incorrectly
applied
the
rule.
in
this
case,
i...
in
this
particular
case,
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question.
the
judge
did
not
attempt
to
balance
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
the
prejudice
versus
the
probativeness
in
this
case.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
i
believe
he
is,
your
honor,
under
the
rule.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
the
appellate
courts
that
have
spoken--
mr.
james
i.
marcus
--he
did
in
this
case.
i
don't
believe...
i
believe
the
appellate
courts
have
always
encouraged
the
district
judges
to
give
their
reasons
on
the
record,
and
indeed,
if
necessary,
write
an
opinion.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
that
is
correct.
i
agree
with
that
proposition.
and
i
agree
that
the
trial
judge
did
decide
this
point,
albeit,
we
submit,
incorrectly.
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
never
saw
fit
to
review
that
decision.
i
don't
quarrel
with
that
proposition
at
all.
the
trial
judge
is
in
the
best
position.
the
single
most
important
evidence
to
a
defense
case
is
the
defendant's
testimony.
its
force
and
effect
on
the
course
of
the
trial
is
well-recognized
by
this
court.
often
times,
without
it,
the
defense
can
only
argue
that
the
government
did
not
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
with
it,
they
are
armed
with
a
direct
denial
of
the
accuser's
accusations.
it
is
also
fair
to
say
that
the
most
significant
factor
in
determining
whether
a
defendant
will
testify
is
whether
or
not
this
prior
conviction
is
admitted.
this,
as
justice
marshall
has
noted,
is
certainly
one
of
the
crucial
points
in
determining
whether
a
defendant
will
or
will
not
take
the
stand.
on
the
one
hand,
the
government
does
not
need
this
evidence
to
prove
its
case.
it
is
merely
general
impeachment
of
the
defendant.
on
the
other
hand,
the
defendant
would
be
reluctant
to
testify
in
the
face
of
this
devastating
impeachment.
the
balancing
considerations
clearly
favor
the
defendant.
we
further
hold
that
the
conduct
of
the
entire
defense
case
will
be
altered
because
of
the
introduction
of
the
general
impeachment,
and
the
defendant
must
either
be
coerced
to
testify
to
preserve
error
in
the
point,
or
remain
mute
and
waive
his
right
to
appeal
an
erroneous
ruling
would
be
intolerable
and
fundamentally
unfair.
to
further
suggest
the
defendant's
testimony
may
not
be
relevant
is
unrealistic.
anything
a
defendant
says
is
important
to
the
tryer
of
fact.
in
virtually
every
case,
the
jury
would
want
to
hear
from
the
defendant
himself.
the
more
sensible
approach,
we
submit,
is
that
what
a
defendant
says
is
relevant
and
pertinent,
especially
to
his
own
defense.
we
also
submit
that
if
a
motion
such
as
this
is
made,
it
is
made
in
good
faith.
the
defendant
indeed
intends
at
that
point
to
testify.
if
there
is
reason
to
question
a
defendant's
willingness
to
testify
or
the
motives
in
filing
of
the
motion,
the
government,
of
course,
may
address
itself
to
this
issue
in
response
to
the
motion.
also,
to
suggest
that
trial
courts
will
not
be
able
to
rule
on
these
motions
is
without
merit,
since
they
have
been
ruling
on
these
issues
for
years,
and
in
virtually
every
circuit,
as
we
had
pointed
out
earlier,
except
the
sixth,
review
is
permitted.
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time,
unless
there
are
more
questions,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
i.
marcus
just
briefly,
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
how
can
a
district
court
ever
review
a
motion
in
limine
such
as
the
one
in
this
particular
case,
we
submit
the
factors
are
present
to
balance
prior
to
the
testimony
of
the
defendant,
the
age
of
the
earlier
conviction,
the
nature
of
the
earlier
conviction,
the
district
court
has
the
charge
before
it
that
the
defendant's
standing
trial
on.
there
are
enough
factors
present
in
the
record
that
the
court
can
indeed
make
a
decision.
we
would
also
point
out,
as
i
just
briefly
mentioned
earlier,
district
courts
have
consistently
ruled
on
these
types
of
motions
for
years.
appellate
courts
have
reviewed
these
rulings
for
years,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
does
indeed
testify.
the
cases
are
well
set
out
in
both
the
solicitor's
and
petitioner's
brief.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
