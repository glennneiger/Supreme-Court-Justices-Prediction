justice
rehnquist
you
say
the
trial
court
definitively
held
this.
actually,
your
client
didn't
attempt
to
testify,
did
he?
justice
rehnquist
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
say
the
trial
court
said
it
then,
since
the
trial
court
wasn't
applying
its
rule
to
any
particular
set
of
facts
that
was
before
it?
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
doubt
that
it
was
definitive,
but
i
just
thinking
holding
is
not...
a
holding
is...
i
think
of
a
legal
rule
applied
to
specific
facts.
i
don't
doubt
that
the
trial
court
had
finally
made
up
its
mind.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
coercive
about
refusing
to
rule
on
a
question
of
admissibility
of
evidence
before
the
evidence
is
presented?
justice
rehnquist
what's
unique
about
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
it
happens
often,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
i
thought
you
meant
by
unique
that
your
client's
case
was
singular,
as
opposed
to
other
similar
types
of
impeachment.
justice
rehnquist
what
did
a
lawyer
tell
his
client
25
years
ago,
you
know,
150
years
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
before
there
were
any
such
things
as
motions
in
limine?
justice
rehnquist
that
was
before
your
time,
i
realize.
[laughter]
frankly,
you've
probably
grown
up
with
motions
in
limine,
but
the
practice
got
along
without
them
quite
well
for
many,
many
years
without
anyone
suggesting
there
was
a
violation
of
any
constitutional
provisions.
justice
rehnquist
well,
under
that
theory,
you
could
come
in
at
the
beginning
of
a
criminal
trial.
the
defendant
could
move
for
a
series
of
rulings
in
limine
on
each
piece
of
evidence
the
prosecution
was
going
to
tender,
each
prosecution...
each
piece
the
defense
was
going
to
tender,
because
presumably
decision
as
to
admissibility
of
any
one
of
those
pieces
of
evidence
might
affect
the
defendant's
trial
strategy.
would
you
go
that
far?
justice
rehnquist
where
would
you
draw
the
line?
justice
rehnquist
not
having
the
ruling
would
just
test
your
skill
as
a
lawyer
and
your
judgment,
which
is
what
lawyers
always
have
to
exercise.
you'll
just
have
to
say,
well,
is
this
the
kind
of
impeachment
that's
admissible
or
not?
then
you
know
your
judge.
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
prejudice
something
that
can
best
be
ascertained
when
the
defendant
actually
takes
the
stand
and
testifies?
justice
rehnquist
could
the
court
make
a
better
or
sounder
ruling
as
to
the
prejudice
if
the
defendant
had
testified?
because
the
question
before
the
court
wasn't...
i
mean,
presumably,
the
defendant
might
have
testified
for
several
hours
on
direct
examination,
and
you
would
never
get
to
the
question
of
impeachment
until
you
get
to
cross-examination.
so
that
the
trial
court
would
have
the
advantage
in
that
case
of
having
heard
the
defendant's
testimony.
justice
rehnquist
we
ordinarily
decide
abstract
questions,
and
it
seems
to
me
until
your
client
takes
the
stand,
this
remains
an
abstract
question.
justice
rehnquist
so
what
rule
do
we
use
to
see
whether
or
not
the
judge
was
wrong?
clearly
erroneous,
or
what?
justice
rehnquist
if
you're
correct,
mr.
kuhlik,
the
government
should
cross-examine
on
this
dry
run.
then
the
government
is
being
forced
to
expose
its
hand
in
cross-examination
before
the
witness
ever
takes
the
stand.
it
seems
to
me
that
suggests
that
this
whole
proceeding,
a
little
show
inside
the
show,
is
not
terribly
desirable.
justice
rehnquist
but,
of
course,
the
defendant
also
wants
a
not
guilty
verdict.
justice
rehnquist
which
isn't
subject
to
appeal.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
settled
law?
