what
if
the
trial
court
had
just
declined
to
rule
at
all
on
the
motion
in
limine?
would
that
have
affected--
justice
o'connor
--what
if
the
trial
judge
had
just
declined
to
rule
on
the
defendant's
motion
in
limine,
and
had
just
said
well,
i
don't
know
if
i'll
consider
this
or
not,
and
had
just
let
it
ride?
i
guess
that,
in
turn,
would
have
affected
the
defendant's
decision
whether
to
testify
or
not,
wouldn't
it?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
you
could
appeal
the
judge's
decision
not
to
rule
on
the
motion
in
limine?
justice
o'connor
so
you
think
a
trial
court
must
then
rule,
entertain
and
rule
on
every
motion
in
limine?
justice
o'connor
i
suppose
i
have
been
laboring
under
the
impression
at
least
that
most
trial
courts
treat
it
as
a
discretionary
matter
with
the
trial
court,
and
as
merely
a
tentative
ruling,
and
not
one
that's
definitive
in
any
event.
justice
o'connor
you
think
the
trial
court
here
could
have
changed
the
ruling
at
the
time
of
trial
if
confronted
with
it
again?
justice
o'connor
or
before.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
kuhlik,
what
if,
as
sometimes
actually
happens,
during
the
motion
in
limine,
defense
counsel
actually
puts
the
defendant
on
the
stand,
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
for
the
benefit
of
the
judge,
and
puts
the
testimony
on
the
stand
and
says
now,
give
me
your
ruling
on
the
motion
in
limine.
we've
got
a
record.
is
that
appealable?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it...
that's
not
far
enough
even?
justice
o'connor
because
that
happens
sometimes
in
trial
courts.
justice
o'connor
sure.
but
suppose
it
happens?
the
trial
judge
decides
to
let
that
happen.
then
is
it
appealable?
what
more
would
be
gained
by
forcing
the
same
testimony
to
take
place
in
front
of
the
jury?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
would
certainly
have
a
factual
record.
justice
o'connor
but
what
if
the
issue
weren't
impeachment
by
a
prior
conviction,
but
whether
the
defendant's
testimony
would
be
immunized
in
some
way?
justice
o'connor
or,
of
course,
a
confession
issue.
justice
o'connor
mr.
kuhlik,
these
are
normally
done
before
trial.
that's
the
real
world.
people
come
in
long
before
trial,
they
want
to
plan
their
trial
strategy,
and
they
come
in
ahead
of
time
and
ask
the
judge
to
set
a
hearing
on
their
motions
in
limine.
and
that's
how
it
happens.
justice
o'connor
in
this
case,
counsel,
do
we
have
to
decide,
is
the
question
presented,
what
would
be
done
if
a
motion
is
made
before
trial?
justice
o'connor
during
trial.
