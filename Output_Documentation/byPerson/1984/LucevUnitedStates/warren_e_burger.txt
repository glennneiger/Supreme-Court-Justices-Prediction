chief
justice

e.
burger
mr.
marcus,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
sometimes
trial
judges
say
to
counsel
i'll
not
act
on
that
now;
renew
your
motion
at
the
time
of
trial.
that's
very
common,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
so
the
problem
might
have
all
been
solved.
chief
justice
burger
didn't
this
problem
arise
only
after
there
were
some
decisions
that,
under
some
circumstances,
prior
convictions
should
be
excluded
if
they
were
too
remote
or
irrelevant
or
what
not?
that's
what
gave
rise
to
this
procedure,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
and
then
the
rule
followed.
chief
justice
burger
now,
when
you
made
the
motion,
did
you
undertake
to
present
reasons
why
in
this
particular
case
the
prior
conviction
should
not
be--
chief
justice
burger
--and
what
was
your
reason?
chief
justice
burger
eight
years
old?
chief
justice
burger
doesn't
the
rule
speak
in
terms
of
relevancy
outweighing
prejudice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kuhlik.
chief
justice
burger
well,
isn't
one
method
that's
used
for
the
defense
counsel
to
proffer
the
testimony,
outline
what
the
testimony
will
be,
if
he's
allowed
to
take
the
stand
without
impeachment,
and
then
if
he
goes
beyond
that
in
any
significant
way,
the
judge
would
be
free
to
alter
his
ruling.
chief
justice
burger
how
would
the
reviewing
court
ever
get
at
it,
unless
there
had
been,
as
i
just
suggested
a
few
minutes
ago,
a
proffer
by
the
defense
as
to
what
he
would
testify
to
if
he
was
permitted
to
testify
free
from
impeachment?
otherwise,
no
court
could
review
it.
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
couldn't
interrupt
a
trial
like
this.
what
would
you
do
with
the
jury
for
a
year
or
two
while
you're
going
up
to
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
burger
perhaps
not,
but
we're
confronted
only
with
the
narrow
question
here.
chief
justice
burger
did
the
court
order
him
to
be
under
oath
in
that
hearing?
chief
justice
burger
is
that
a
recent
case?
chief
justice
burger
let's
hope
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
marcus?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen;
the
case
is
submitted.
