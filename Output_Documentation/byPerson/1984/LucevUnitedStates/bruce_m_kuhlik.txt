mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioner
seeks
review
of
an
advisory
evidentiary
ruling
when
the
evidence
was
never
actually
offered
or
admitted
at
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
determined
that
in
that
circumstance,
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
preserve
his
claim
of
error
for
appeal.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
vividly
why
that
rule
is
an
appropriate
one
in
these
circumstances.
petitioner
made
his
motion
in
limine
on
the
second
day
of
trial,
before
the
government
had
rested,
while
the
government
was
still
putting
on
its
case.
petitioner
stated
in
the
motion
that
he
intends
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf;
did
not
state
that
he
intended
to
testify
only
if
his
motion
were
granted.
he
did
not
lay
out
any
testimony
that
he
wished
to
give,
and
has
never
done
so.
the
court's
ruling
on
the
motion,
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
identified,
is
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
21
and
22.
and
i
think
it
bears
close
scrutiny.
the
court
stated
that
if
the
petitioner
testified
concerning
his
flight
to
avoid
arrest,
his
flight
from
the
arresting
officers,
then
the
court
would
keep
the
impeachment
evidence
out.
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
if,
on
the
other
hand,
petitioner
testifies
about
drugs,
"i've
never
had
any
prior
drug
involvement.
"
then
i'll
let
the
impeachment
evidence
in.
and
i
take
it,
petitioner
has
no
quarrel
with
either
of
those
rulings.
certainly,
petitioner
does
to
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that
the
evidence
would
not
come
in
if
he
testified
concerning
the
flight.
moreover,
in
his
brief
on
pages
14
through
15,
petitioner
states
that,
if
indeed
he
did
testify
that
he
had
no
prior
drug
involvement,
the
impeachment
would
clearly
be
proper.
what
is
it,
then,
that
petitioner
seeks
to
review
on
appeal?
he
has
never
offered
any
sort
of
evidence
that
he
wished
to
present,
that
he
was
precluded
from
presenting
by
the
court's
ruling.
moreover,
the
very
fact
that
the
district
court
looked
to
the
substance
of
what
petitioner
would
testify
to
in
determining
how
it
would
rule
on
the
motion,
demonstrates
that
the
court
was,
in
fact,
applying
the
balancing
test
that
is
required
under
rule
609,
and
it
demonstrates
a
more
general
point
under
that
rule
as
well;
that
the
court
cannot
make
its
final
intelligent,
informed
ruling
under
rule
609
until
it
has
in
front
of
it
the
defendant's
actual
testimony,
until
it
has
seen
what
the
defendant
has
to
say
and
seen
how
his
demeanor
and
his
credibility
have
been
demonstrated
before
the
jury.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
well,
he's
insisting
that
the
court
was
wrong,
but
he's
never
identified
what
element
of
the
ruling
was
incorrect.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
well,
perhaps
it
might
be
more
clearly--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--certainly,
your
honor.
perhaps
i
should
say
the
petitioner
has
not
shown
any
prejudice
from
the
ruling.
he's
never
demonstrated
what
he
would
have
testified
to
that
he
was
precluded
from
testifying
to.
in
fact,
he
was
never
precluded--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
that's
true.
and
prior
sixth
circuit
precedent
clearly
suggested
that
result
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
le
blanc,
in
which
the
government
on
appeal
confessed
to
error
on
the--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--well,
i
think
it
would
have
been
helpful,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
enough,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
informed
definitive
ruling
can
only
be
made,
can
only
be
intelligently
reviewed
by
a
court
of
appeals
in
terms
of
looking
at
the
reasonableness
of
the
district
court's
exercise
of
discretion,
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
determining
whether
there
was
any
harmless
error,
whether
the
error,
if
any,
was
prejudicial
to
the
defendant.
that
can
only
take
place
in
the
context
of
a
defendant's
actual
testimony
at
trial.
that's
the
only
time
when
the
district
court
can
say
in
light
of...
the
district
court
may
find
that
the
defendant's
testimony
was
so
irrelevant
or
his
demeanor
so
inherently
incredible
that
impeachment
would
not
be
justified.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
no.
i
believe
that
it's
perfectly
proper
for
the
court
to
make--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--i
believe
the
circumstances,
your
honor,
are
that
the
court
makes
a
preliminary
ruling
that
says,
based
on
what
i
know
now,
here's
what
i
think
i
will
rule.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
of
course,
your
honor,
i
think
that
a
proffer--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--because
what
it
is
sensible
for
the
district
court
to
do
is
to
make
a
preliminary
ruling
and
say,
based
on
what
i
know
now,
this
is
how
i
think
i
will
rule.
it's
always
subject
to
change.
if
the
district
court
here
had
said
here's
how
i
think
i
will
rule,
but
i
want
to
think
about
it
some
more,
we
wouldn't
be
right
now.
it
clearly
would
be
so
tentative--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--if
he
stays
off
the
stand?
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--the
broad
rule
stating
that
evidentiary
claims
are
only
preserved
when
the
evidence
is
actually
admitted
is
the
preferable
one.
i
would
suggest
that--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--that's
correct,
unless,
your
honor,
i
suppose
there
may
be
an
exception
in
the
case
of
plain
error.
if
there
were
some
error
that
were
truly
egregious
and,
for
example,
a
matter
of
law
that
was
reviewable--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--that's
true.
i
don't
see
how
a
court
of
appeals
can
make
either
an
intelligent
ruling
on
the
merits
or
a
determination
of
whether
any
error
was
harmless
or
not.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
situation
makes
reviewability
an
easier
task,
more
appropriate,
but
we
don't
believe
it
goes
far
enough.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
let
me
tell
you
why.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
it
does,
your
honor,
but
it
creates
a
host
of
procedural
problems
of
its
own.
you're
talking
about
stopping
the
trial,
conducting
an
extensive
voir
dire--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--first,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
voir
dire
would
also
have
to
include
cross-examination
by
the
government.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
and
to
suggest
that
what
is
gained
is
you
still...
even
with
the
defendant
stating
that
he
will
take
the
stand,
you
still
have
no
guarantee
that
he
would
do
so;
you
still
have
no
guarantee
that
the
government,
in
the
event,
would
decide
to
introduce
the
evidence.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
you
would
have
a
better
record,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
that
approach
is
simply
more
trouble
than
it's
worth,
in
a
way,
that
it's...
you're
talking
about
taking
a
lot
of
time
out
of
a
trial.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
whether--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--your
honor,
where
you're
talking
about
rulings
of
law
that
don't
depend
on
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
trial
court,
i
think
you've
got
a
more
appropriate
case
for
review.
we
would
still
say,
though,
that
the
better
rule
would
be
the
broader
one
that
the
claim
is
preserved
only
when
the
evidence
is
actually
admitted.
the
only--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--i
think
that's
perfectly
right,
your
honor.
not
only
would
the
government
be
forced
to
show
its
hand,
but
the
defendant
would
be
forced
to
show
his
as
well.
the
ninth
circuit,
in
cook,
suggested
that
these
sorts
of
rulings
could
be
done
before
trial
even
began,
and
that
would,
to
some
extent,
satisfy
the
problem
of
not
interrupting
trial.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
well,
quite
obviously,
there's
no
right
of
the
defendant
to
an
interlocutory
appeal
at
this
point.
i
would
suggest
that
the
rulings--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--your
honor,
and
in
that
circumstance,
the
showing
of
prejudice
is
particularly
difficult
for
the
defendant
to
make.
you're
talking
about
relying
on
a
representation
that
the
defendant
intends
to
testify.
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
brooks
v.
tennessee,
the
actual
conduct
of
the
trial
with
the
defendant's
own
witnesses
is
an
important
determination
in
whether
or
not
the
defendant
will
decide
to
testify.
that's
why
the
court
said,
in
brooks,
that
it
was
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
require
a
defendant
to
be
his
own
first
witness.
so,
without
in
any
way
doubting
a
defendant's
good
faith,
counsel's
good
faith,
i
would
wonder
about
the
advisability
of
relying
on
a
representation
made
weeks
before
trial,
simply
that
the
defendant
intends
to
testify.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
no,
your
honor.
this
motion
was
made
after
trial.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
during
trial,
although
i
don't
believe
the
result
should
be--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
under
any
approach
that
the
court
would
choose
to
adopt,
this
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
the
defendant
has
simply
made
no...
petitioner
has
made
no
showing
of
prejudice
at
all.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
that
is
the
narrowest
ground
on
which
you
could
decide
the
case.
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeal
rule
is
the
best
one
and
should
be
adopted
by
the
court,
but
the
court
certainly
need
not
go
that
far
to
uphold
the
judgment
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
stress
a
few
points
in
response
to
petitioner's
points.
the
first
is
that,
there
is
clearly
no
right
under
the
constitution
or
under
the
rules
to
an
advanced
ruling
of
this
sort.
courts
are
well
within
their
discretion
to
refuse
to
rule
on
them,
and
they
do
it
quite
often.
and
it
differs
significantly
from
motions
to
suppress,
for
example,
for
several
reasons.
perhaps
the
most
important
is
that
a
motion
to
suppress
can
be
decided
without
trial
of
the
general
case.
you're
talking
about
a
motion
to
suppress
a
ruling
of
law
which
can
be
clearly
decided
before
trial.
here,
on
the
other
hand,
you're
talking
about
a
district
court's
exercise
of
discretion
under
the
rules,
balance
and
probative
value,
prejudicial
effect.
these
things
are
quintessentially
things
that
the
court
can
only
finally
determine
at
trial
and,
for
that
reason,
there
is
clearly
no
right
to
an
advanced
ruling.
i
would
also
emphasize
that
rule
609
itself
is
not
of
constitutional
magnitude.
even
where
there
is
error,
it's
not...
it
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
due
process,
simply
because
a
conviction
is
admitted
into
evidence
in
violation
of
the
rule.
and
i
would
remind
the
court
as
well
that
limiting
instructions
are
available
on
the
proper
use
of
this
impeachment
evidence.
the
rule
adopted
by
the
court
below,
requiring
that
evidentiary
claims
be
preserved
only
where
the
evidence
is
actually
offered
at
a
trial,
has
several
benefits.
i've
touched
on
some
of
those
already.
one
of
the
most
important
is
that
it
makes
for
a
clear
showing
of
actual
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
where
the
evidence
is
actually
admitted,
you
have
the
defendant
taking
the
stand,
you
can
see
the
relevance
of
his
testimony,
you
give
the
government
a
chance
to
decide
in
light
of
the
defendant's
testimony,
and
not
merely
in
light
of
his
pretrial
proffer,
either
through
counsel
or
through
voir
dire,
to
decide
whether
to
offer
the
evidence
or,
in
the
middle
of
trial,
to
decide
perhaps
that
the
defendant's
testimony
is
so
weak
and
the
government's
tastes
so
strong,
that
it
need
not
risk
a
reversal
because
it
is
far
more
likely
to
convict,
even
without
the
conviction.
you
give
the
district
court
one
last
chance
to
decide
the
motion
finally,
when
the
evidence
is
offered
at
the
right
time.
this
allows
the
court
the
opportunity,
the
appeals
court,
to
clearly
identify
the
ruling
that
it's
reviewing.
i
have
suggested
here
that
the
district
court's
ruling
was
simply
a
denial
or
a
grant
of
the
motion.
in
fact,
it
was
rather
complicated.
the
court
attempted
to
step
into
the
vacuum
created
by
petitioner's
failure
to
proffer
any
evidence,
and
suggest
if
you
testify
this
way,
i'll
rule
this
way;
if
you
testify
that
way,
i'll
rule
another
way.
petitioner
may
suggest
a
broader
reading
of
the
district
court's
ruling
here,
but
when
you
are
reviewing
the
ruling
admitting
the
evidence
at
trial,
its
far
simpler.
the
court
of
appeals
need
not
guess.
it's
got
the
ruling
right
there,
it
knows
what
it
is
reviewing.
finally,
note
that
reviewing
the
rulings
only
when
the
evidence
is
actually
offered
at
trial
makes
the
job
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
determining
whether
any
error
is
harmless,
far
simpler.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
your
honor,
i
think
the
rulings
serve
a
useful
purpose,
whether
or
not
they
themselves
are
reviewable,
because
we're
talking
about
a
discretionary
rule
to
begin
with.
the
rule
doesn't
compel
the
district
court
to
admit
or
exclude
the
evidence.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
far
more
likely
to
happen
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
in
limine
rulings
are
reviewable,
because
that's
the
circumstance
where
reversible
error
is
being
created
without
a
real
showing
of
prejudice.
when
the
rulings
aren't
reviewable,
both
parties
benefit
from
an
advance
notice
of
how
the
district
court
is
feeling
about
it,
how
it
intends
to
exercise
its
discretion,
and
both
sides
better
plan
their
case.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
they
can't,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
the
fearwell
case,
which
is
cited
by
the
court
below,
and
is
a
case
from
the
d.c.
circuit,
was
one
where
the
defendant
had
not
made
any
proffer,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
without
discussing
the
reviewability
question,
reviewed
the
ruling,
determined
it
was
error,
said
but
we
can't
determine
whether
it's
harmless,
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
hold
a
hearing
and
for
the
defendant
to
introduce
what
he
would
have
testified
to.
now,
that
sort
of--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--i
don't
recall,
your
honor,
but
i
would
suggest
that
he
would
be.
but--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
that's
the
kind
of
difficulties
that
you
get
into
when
you
review
these
sorts
of
rulings
outside
of
the
actual
testimony.
that
type
of
result
makes
no
sense
from
any
sort
of
viewpoint.
and
we
suggest
it's
wrong.
finally,
i
would
turn
to
the
fair
and
consistent
treatment
of
defendants.
petitioner
has
suggested
that
it
is
unfair
to
him
to
require
him
to
testify,
but
this
is
really
the
sort
of
decision
that
defendants
and
their
counsel
are
confronted
with
all
through
every
trial.
the
only
risk,
the
only
real
risk
at
the
present,
i
would
suggest,
is
that
defense
counsel
might
inaccurately
predict
how
the
court
of
appeals
would
come
out.
if
defense
counsel
believes
that
a
ruling
admitting
the
evidence
would
be
upheld
on
appeal,
then
the
path
is
clear;
the
defendant
does
not
take
the
stand.
similarly,
if
defense
counsel
believes
it's
erroneous,
the
path
is
similarly
clear.
defendant
takes
the
stand.
perhaps
the
evidence
is
offered.
perhaps
the
district
court
does
admit
it.
then
defendant
has
his
point
for
appeal.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
of
course,
he
does,
your
honor,
but
there
are--
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
--there
are
many
circumstances
where
a
defendant's
desire
to
obtain
an
acquittal
in
front
of
his
first
jury
conflicts
to
some
extent
with
his
need
to
preserve
points
for
appeal.
i
would
point
to
only
one,
which
is
the
motion
to
acquittal
contest,
where
a
defendant's
motion
to
acquit
is
denied
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case
and
the
defendant
then
chooses
to
put
on
evidence
of
his
own.
he
will
have
waived
on
appeal
his
claim
that
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
acquit
was
there.
mr.
bruce
m.
kuhlik
your
honor,
there
are
some
circuits,
i
believe,
that
have
gone
the
other
way.
this
court,
in
the
calderon
case,
stated
that
that
is
the
correct
statement
of
the
law.
and
that's
a
circumstance
where
defendant
is
put
to
what
we
concede
to
be
a
difficult
choice:
do
i
do
my
best
to
be
acquitted
here
by
putting
on
evidence,
or
do
i
stake
my
chances
right
on
my
motion
to
acquit,
which
i
believe
was
a
good
one?
very
similar
to
the
circumstances
here.
and
i
would
suggest
the
same
result
should
apply.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
