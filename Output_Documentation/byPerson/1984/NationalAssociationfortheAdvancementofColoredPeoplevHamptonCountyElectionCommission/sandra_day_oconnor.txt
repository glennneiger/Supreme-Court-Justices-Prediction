justice
o'connor
oh,
it
does.
mr.
derfner.
justice
o'connor
was
evidence
submitted
before
the
district
court
about
the
premature
removal
of
the
county
superintendent?
justice
o'connor
mm-hmm.
yes.
i
know
the
sg
takes
the
position
that
it
was
precleared,
but
the
position
had
just
been
abolished,
and
there
wasn't
any
other
evidence
of
some
preclearing.
justice
o'connor
so
what
is
your
suggestion
that
we
do?
