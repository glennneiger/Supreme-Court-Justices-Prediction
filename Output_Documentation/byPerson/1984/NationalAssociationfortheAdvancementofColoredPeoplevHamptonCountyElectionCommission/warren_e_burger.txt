mr.
derfner,
i
think
you
may
proceed
with
a
reduced
audience
here.
chief
justice
burger
let
me
get
your
reaction.
chief
justice
burger
in
setting
the
time,
what
are
the
factors
that
could
be
used
for
or
against?
how
would
the
time
enter
into
it?
i
can
see
you
wouldn't...
sometimes
time
is
a
factor
that
the
farmers
can't
come
in
if
they
are
engaged
in
harvesting
and
things
of
that
kind?
what
would
be
the
factors
here?
chief
justice
burger
so
that
a
section
5
inquiry
would
be
a
neutral
eye
cast
on
that?

mr.
strauss?
chief
justice
burger
mr.
strauss--
--have
you
any
idea
what
percentage
of
the
total
are
pro
forma?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
didn't
mean...
a
lot
f
things
are
pro
forma
which
get
a
review,
but
that
they
are
in
clear
compliance,
and
they
go
back.
there
must
be
a
substantial
proportion
of
them
that
give
no
trouble
at
all
at
the
first
level.

further,

you,
