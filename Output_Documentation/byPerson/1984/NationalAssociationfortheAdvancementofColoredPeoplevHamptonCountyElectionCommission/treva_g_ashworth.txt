ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
voting
rights
act
requires
a
county
jurisdiction
to
submit
changes
before
implementing
those
changes.
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
act
that
created
election
law
changes
were
submitted
to
the
justice
department
for
preclearance.
this
case
arises
purely
over
whether
or
not
the
preliminary
step
of
filing,
and
whether
or
not
an
election
date
which
must
be
postponed
because
preclearance
comes
too
late
to
hold
it
at
the
time
scheduled,
must
be
submitted
to
the
justice
department
for
preclearance.
the
facts
of
this
case
involves
two
acts
which
were
enacted
within
three
weeks
of
each
other
which
created
substantially
different
governing
bodies
for
the
hampton
county
school
board.
the
first
act,
act
2...
547,
excuse
me...
made
the
position
for
county
board
of
education
elective.
this
act
was
submitted
and
precleared
by
the
justice
department.
subsequently,
act
549
was
enacted
which
abolished
this
board
and
devolved
its
powers
and
duties
upon
the
second
two
boards
of
trustees.
this
act,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
was
not
submitted
for
two
and
a
half
months.
the
reason,
i
have
been
told
by
our
office,
is
because
it
took
that
long
to
gather
the
information
necessary
to
comply
with
the
requirements
as
to
the
information
they
want
submitted
with
the
act.
this
act
was
submitted
and
initially
objected
by
the
justice
department.
the
justice
department
was
requested
to
withdraw
their
objection,
which
they
did,
on
november
19.
the
problems
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
arise
purely
over
the
timing
of
this
preclearance
of
the
second
act.
the
second
act
provides
specific,
one-time
filings
of
august
16
to
31st,
and
required
an
election
to
be
held
on
november
2.
as
of
august
16,
there
had
been
no
preclearance
or
objection
from
the
justice
department.
the
county
election
commission
therefore
was
faced
with
the
implementation
of
two
conflicting
acts,
the
second
one,
should
it
become
precleared,
would
abolish
the
first
act
and
abolish
the
board
established
by
the
first
act.
to
comply
and
to
create
a
good
faith
effort,
they
allowed
filing
to
begin
for
both
offices.
this
filing,
pursuant
to
the
second
act,
admittedly
began
before
preclearance
was
received.
the
district
court
found
filing
to
not
be
a
section
5
violation
in
that
filing
did
not
constitute
implementation
of
an
act
but
merely
an
administrative
or
administerial
action
necessary
to
accomplish
the
act's
purpose,
and
not
a
change
from
section
5.
the
court
further
found
that
even
should
this
be
a
section
5
change,
it
was
precleared
retroactively
when
the
act
was
precleared.
we
would
submit
that
filing
is
not
implementation
of
an
act.
it
is
purely
a
preliminary
step
that
will
be
null
and
void
if
the
act
is
initially
or
subsequently...
excuse
me...
subsequently
objected
to.
it
is
an
administrative
or
administerial
step
so
that
orderly
elections
can
proceed.
the
justice
department
has
until
recently
not
objected
to
these
preliminary
steps
occurring.
two
months
before
filing
began
in
hampton
county
the
justice
department
allowed
filing
to
begin
and
include
the
county
offices
pursuant
to
an
act
which
established
filing
dates
before
they
precleared
this
one
act.
in
herron
v.
koch,
a
federal
district
court
case,
the
justice
department,
apparently
as
late
as
1981,
urged
the
court
to
allow
a
primary
to
continue
in
the
hopes
that
they
would
be
able
to
preclear
the
act
before
the
general
election.
the
justice
department
has
also
retroactively
approved
changes
that
have
happened,
and
this
court
has
acknowledged
the
possibility
of
retroactive
approval.
the
actual
implementation
of
the
act,
we
would
submit,
would
have
been
to
have
held
the
election
before
preclearance
or
in
violation
of
an
objection,
but
that
did
not
happen.
when
the
justice
department
interposed
an
objection,
an
election
was
not
held
pursuant
to
the
second
act,
but
the
first
act,
even
though
that
board
would,
of
course,
be
abolished
by
the
second
act
should
preclearance
come.
and
seventeen
days
after
the
general
election,
that's
exactly
what
happened,
the
first
board
was
abolished
by
an
approval
of
the
second
act.
following
preclearance
of
the
act
on
november
19,
the
election
commission
set
a
march
election
date
for
an
election
to
be
held
now
pursuant
to
the
now
precleared
act.
the
appellants
claim
this
date
should
have
been
precleared.
the
district
court
found
that
setting
an
election
date
and
conducting
this
election
was
not
a
change
in
south
carolina
law
but
an
effort
comply
with
the
law
and
the
precleared
changes.
section
5
has
been
variously
interpreted
by
this
court
as
having
the
effect
of
suspending,
freezing,
delaying,
or
postponing
the
implementation
of
an
act.
submission
of
an
act
to
the
justice
department
is
supposed
to
be
a
rapid
alternative,
a
speedy
method
of
enforcement.
setting
an
election
date
in
this
instance
is
simply
an
unfreezing
of
a
postponed
election.
the
election
date
is
therefore
a
substitute
election
for
an
election
that
could
not
be
timely
held
at
the
time
provided
for
in
the
act
purely
because
the
act
was
not
precleared
timely.
if
now
there
is
added
on
an
additional
requirement
of
preclearing
the
date
every
time
approval
should
come
later
than
the
anticipated
time
for
the
election,
the
alternate
remedy
of
a
speedy
alternative
of
submission
to
the
justice
department
would
never
be
realized.
certainly
we
would
submit
that
the
filing
is
not
implementation
of
an
act
but
merely
a
preliminary
step
that
is
null
and
void
should
the
act
be
ultimately
objected
to.
likewise,
the
election
date
was
simply
unfrozen
and
reset
following
preclearance
of
this
act.
for
these
reasons,
we
would
urge
the
district
court
be
affirmed.
