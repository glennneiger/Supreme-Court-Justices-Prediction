mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
turn
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
why
the
resolution
of
the
questions
presented
can
have
an
important
effect
on
the
attorney
general's
ability
to
carry
out
his
responsibilities
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
major
theme
of
the
appellees'
argument
and
the
district
court's
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
is
that
the
attorney
general
can
be
deemed
to
have
precleared
changes
implicitly,
that
is
to
say,
he
can
be
deemed
to
have
cleared
them
even
though
he
was
not
aware
that
he
was
clearing
them,
and
even
though
in
this
case
he
did
not
know
of
the
changes
and
could
not
possibly
have
known
about
the
changes
because
they
had
not
even
teen
instituted
at
the
time
he
issued
his
preclearance.
now,
this
argument
in
one
form
or
another
has
been
made
to
the
court
on
several
occasions
in
allen,
in
sheffield
county,
and
jest
last
term
in
mccain,
and
as
mr.
derfner
pointed
out,
it
has
been
repeatedly
rejected
by
the
court.
but
the
point
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
the
practicalities
of
administering
section
5
make
it
very
important
that
as
the
attorney
general's
regulations
require,
covered
jurisdictions
make
a
clear
statement
in
their
submission
of
exactly
what
changes
they
are
seeking
to
have
precleared,
and
that
no
changes
be
deemed
precleared
except
on
the
basis
of
such
a
clear
submission.
now,
the
reason
that
is
important
is
that
as
congress
recognized,
and
as
our
experience
in
administering
section
5
has
shown,
a
lot
of
the
threats
to
equality
in
voting
occur
at
the
level
of
low
visibility
nuts
and
bolts
electoral
decisions
that
can
only
be
properly
evaluated
in
a
particular
local
context.
for
example,
the
legislative
history
of
the
voting
rights
act
mentions
a
change
from
paper
ballots
to
voting
machines
as
the
kind
of
change
that
would
have
to
be
precleared,
and
in
perkins,
an
early
decision,
this
court
held
that
a
change
in
voting
places
had
to
be
precleared.
so
when
the
attorney
general
is
presented
with
a
scheme,
he
doesn't
just
decide
in
the
abstract,
on
the
basis
of
some
broad
presumption,
whether
the
scheme
is
discriminatory.
he
has
to
look
at
whether
the
particular
elements
of
that
scheme,
in
the
particular
context,
will
have
a
discriminatory
purpose
and
effect.
and
in
doing
so,
of
course,
he
has
to
rely
to
a
large
extent
on
input
from
people
at
the
local
level
who
are
familiar
with
the
scheme.
now,
this
whole
process
just
can't
operate
unless
the
attorney
general
and
people
in
the
local
community
know
exactly
what
changes
they
are
addressing
and
what
problems
they
are
examining
in
the
local
context.
here
the
jurisdiction
did
not
specify
the
particular
elements
of
the
scheme
that
they
now
claim
were
precleared,
and
in
fact,
the
election
date,
as
i
said,
hadn't
even
been
set
at
the
time
that
the
attorney
general
precleared
act
549.
now,
the
jurisdiction...
the
appellees,
that
is,
point
out
that
when
the
attorney
general
cleared
act
549,
the
filing
period
had
taken
place.
as
mr.
derfner
said,
it
is
net
clear
whether
the
attorney
general
was
even
apprised
of
that,
but
even
assuming
he
was,
the
most
the
attorney
general
can
be
said
to
have
cleared
was
the
use
of
that
august
filing
period
with
a
november
election.
he
did
not
preclear
the
use
of
that
august
filing
period
with
a
march
special
election,
which
he
had
no
idea
was
scheduled,
and
he
certainly
did
not
preclear
a
situation
in
which
local
officials
could
look
at
the
results
of
the
august
filing
period,
see
who
had
filed
and
who
hadn't,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
make
their
decision
about
whether
to
use
that
filing
qualification
in
a
special
election.
the
minor
theme,
it
seems
to
me,
of
the
appellees'
argument
in
this
case
is
that
essentially
they
did
all
they
could
to
try
to
carry
out
the
sudden
change
in
the
laws
governing
school
governance
in
hampton
county,
and
they
oct
into
a
time
bind
because
of
confusion
at
the
attorney
general's
end,
and
that
time
binds
like
this,
they
suggest,
will
be
fairly
common
in
the
administration
of
the
act,
and
some
leeway
should
be
allied
the
districts
to
deal
with
them.
that
i
think
is
completely
incorrect.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
appellees
were
in
a
bind,
but
the
reason
they
got
in
a
bind
was
that
they
waited
two
and
a
half
months
after
the
first
enactment
of
act
549
before
they
submitted
it
at
all.
and
since
the
attorney
general
must
act
within
sixty
days,
a
delay
of
two
and
a
half
months
was
what
put
them
in
the
predicament
they
found
themselves
in.
the
second
contributing
factor
to
the
confusion
in
this
case
was
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
initially
interposed
an
objection.
but
as
mr.
derfner
explained
that
objection,
the
interposition
of
that
objection
and
subsequent
withdrawal
were
not
the
result
of
confusion
or
bureaucratic
ineptitude;
there
was
a
very
serious,
very
substantial
question
whether
that
act
was
discriminatory,
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
initial
objection.
i
have
one
final
point.
the
section
5
was,
of
course,
very
controversial
when
the
voting
rights
act
was
first
passed
because
it
was
thought
by
some
to
intrude
unreasonably
into
state
and
local
government
affairs,
but
our
experience
suggests
that
now,
almost
20
years
later,
the
covered
jurisdictions
have
accommodated
themselves
to
section
5
and
find
it
to
be
an
acceptable
and
minimal
burden
at
most.
the
attorney
general
has
issued
regulations
specifying
the
form
that
submissions
are
to
take.
the
covered
jurisdictions
know
that
all
changes
are
submitted.
they
submit
them
routinely.
the
attorney
general
acts
very
promptly,
and
nearly
every
change
is
promptly
precleared.
ambiguities
in
the
scope
of
the
preclearance
requirement,
such
as
those
that
are
said
to
exist
here,
are
quite
atypical.
they
are
very
much
the
exception
and
not
the
rule.
but
if
the
appellees
and
others...
excuse
me...
are
successful
in
carving
out
exceptions
to
this
preclearance
regime,
even
though
nothing
in
section
5
supports
the
creation
of
such
exceptions,
not
only
would
the
result
be
inconsistent
with
congress'
intent,
but
in
the
long
run,
this
disintegrating
erosion
of
particular
exceptions,
as
justice
cardoza
said,
would
not
ever
be
of
particular
benefit
to
the
covered
jurisdictions
because
it
would
inject
elements
of
uncertainty
and
confusion
and
litigation
into
what
has
become
an
essentially
stable
and
mutually
acceptable
state
of
affairs
under
section
5.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
for
the
most
part
it
is,
justice
white.
i
think
this
is
something
that
at
least
as
far
as
our
experience
suggests
the
covered
jurisdictions
have
adjusted
to,
and
they
find
it
to
be
very
little
of
an
interference
anymore.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
can't
do
the
arithmetic
that
quickly,
justice
powell.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
were
8600
in
the
first
six
months
of
this
year.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
also,
that's
even
a
harder
arithmetical
problem,
justice
powell.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
not
all
of
these
reach
the
attorney
general,
or
even
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
civil
rights
division.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
he
has
delegated
his
authority
pursuant
to
the
statute
to
the
assistant
attorney
general.
this
is...
this
is--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
believe
the
number
is
increasing
slightly.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
there
are
differences
depending
on
the
rate
of
reapportionment
changes
in
response
to
the
census
and
so
on.
so
i
am
not
sure
a
secular
trend
can
be
identified.
put
to
the
extent
it
can,
they
are
increasing.
my
understanding
of
the
procedure
for
handling
submissions,
justice
powell,
is
that
if
the
staff
people
in
the
justice
department
in
the
voting...
in
the
section
5
section
of
the
civil
rights
division,
conclude
that
a
change
should
be
cleared,
then
that
change
reaches
only
the
head
of
that
section
and
does
not
reach
the
assistant
attorney
general.
but
if
they
are
of
the
view
that
a
change
should
not
be
cleared,
that
an
objection
should
be
interposed,
then
that
objection
is
passed
on
personally
by
the
assistant
attorney
general,
so
that
his
concentration
really
is
on
the
very
small
percentage,
although
not
insignificant
number,
of
objections
or
possible
objections.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
think
any
of
them
are
pro
forma
in
the
sense
that
they
are
given
no
review.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
my
impression
is
that
that
is
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
substantial
proportion.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
my
impression
is
that
it
is
not
an
atypical
year.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
have
no
reason
to
think
otherwise.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
is
that
right?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
thank
you.
