mr.
armand
derfner
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
school
board
election
in
hampton
county,
south
carolina,
in
particular,
a
special
election
held
in
march
1983
without
the
preclearance
that
we
think
is
required
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
hampton
county
is
a
small,
rural
county
in
the
lower
part
of
the
state,
just
across
the
river
from
the
state
of
georgia.
it
is
approximately
half
black
and
half
white.
it
is
divided
into
two
school
districts.
district
1
in
the
north
is
pretty
well
integrated,
well
financed
because
of
a
good
tax
base,
including
some
industrial
area,
and
has
generally
been
fairly
successful.
district
2
in
the
south
is
mostly
black,
a
very
poor
school
district,
suffering
largely
from
a
very
poor
tax
base.
these
disparities
between
the
two
school
districts
have
produced
considerable
political
controversy
in
the
county,
especially
controversy
between
supporters
of
a
strong
countywide
board
of
education
who
have
been
mostly
black,
and
those
supporters
of
strong
autonomous
district
boards
who
have
been
mostly
whites,
especially
in
the
northern
part
of
the
county.
in
1982
this
controversy
culminated
in
the
general
assembly's
passing
act
549.
act
549
abolished
the
county
board
and
changed
the
district
boards
from
appointed
boards
to
elected
district
boards.
it
provided
that
the
elections
for
the
district
boards
would
be
held
in
november
along
with
the
general
elections,
and
it
also
provided
that
the
first
filing,
that
is,
for
the
elections
in
1982,
would
be
conducted
in
august,
on
specified
dates
between
august
16
and
31.
for
reasons
that
will
probably
become
clear,
preclearance
of
this
statute,
which
was
passed
in
the
spring
of
1982,
was
not
obtained
until
after
the
november
election
date,
that
is,
until
mid-november
1982.
because
preclearance
had
not
been
obtained,
the
election
did
not
go
forward.
however,
despite
the
absence
of
preclearance,
the
appellees,
the
election
commission,
had
gone
ahead
with
a
filing
period
in
august
of
1982.
after
preclearance
was
obtained,
in
the
middle
of
november,
the
election
commission
then
set
about
to
set
a
special
election.
they
did
so
selecting
a
date
in
march
1983
without
preclearing
that
date,
and
they
also
then
selected
a
filing
period
also
without
preclearance.
the
filing
period
happened
to
be
the
same
dates
in
august
of
1982
that
they
had
previously
had
the
previous
year
at
a
time
when
the
statute
had
not
been
precleared.
in
fact,
that
filing
period
was
enforced
in
1983
by
turning
away
several
candidates,
including
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
who
appeared
after
the
announcement
of
the
march
election
and
wanted
to
run
in
that
election.
those
people
were
turned
away.
this
suit,
therefore,
was
brought
to
stop
the
special
election
in
march,
chiefly
because
there
had
been
no
preclearance
of
the
election
date
with
filing
period.
the
district
court
upheld
the
appellees
in
both
the
setting
of
the
special
election
without
preclearance,
and
the
setting
of
the
filing
period
without
preclearance
on
the
grounds
essentially
that
election
dates
and
filing
periods
are
in
effect
not
covered
by
section
5
because
they
are
ministerial,
administrative,
or
things
of
that
sort,
and
in
the
alternative,
the
district
court
held
that
when
the
department
had
cleared
the
statute
at
549
in
november,
that
that
clearance
was
essentially
blanket
approval
of
all
that
had
gone
before
as
well
as
all
that
might
come
afterward,
even
though
at
the
time
of
the
department's
clearance
in
november
it
was
not
even
known
whether
or
when
there
would
be
a
special
election
or
what
filing
arrangements
would
be
made.
mr.
armand
derfner
it
was
known
that...
it
would
have
been
known
that
if
the
county,
if
the
state
wanted
to
proceed
with
the
enforcement
of
act
549,
they
would
have
to
have
an
election
at
some
point.
whether
they
were
going
to
have
a
special
election
or
wait
until
the
following
november
period
in
1984,
that
wasn't
known.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
for
having
any
idea
what
was
going
to
happen.
there
were
people
who
had
been
elected
because
of
a
complicated
procedural
situation,
and
there
were
people
there
running
the
school
systems
who
had
been
duly
elected.
before
i
leave
the
facts,
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the
question
of
what
happened
just
before
the
preclearance
because
the
date
may
be
puzzling.
the
act
549
was
passed
in
april
of
1982.
it
was
not,
however,
submitted
for
preclearance
for
more
than
two
months,
for
approximately
two
and
a
half
months,
in
june.
it
was
then,
an
answer
was
due
in
august,
and
at
that
time
the
justice
department
objected
to
act
549
on
the
grounds
that
the
abolition
of
the
county
board
would
dilute
the
votes
of
black
voters
in
their
attempts
to
exercise
political
influence
over
schools
in
hampton
county.
a
petition
for
reconsideration
was
made,
and
in
november
the
department
withdrew
its
objection.
that's
when
preclearance
was
first
obtained.
it
withdrew
its
objection
because
it
read
state
law
to
indicate
that
certain
powers
didn't
reside
in
the
county
board.
we
happen
to
think
that
the
department
misread
the
state
law
in
that.
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
because
obviously
we
can't
complain
about
the
department's
decision.
i
mention
it
only
to
indicate
that
the
objection
that
the
department
had
entered
was
quite
a
serious
one,
responding
to
a
serious
situation,
and
that
therefore
the
time
that
passed
before
the
department
had
finally
precleared
it
was
not
simply
an
accident.
the
question
before
this
court
then
is
whether
there
was
any
basis
for
the
district
court
to
make
its
broad
exceptions
and
in
effect
to,
we
believe,
to
read
out
of
the
law
this
court's
prior
holdings
and
the
clear
language
of
the
statute.
in
connection
with
the
setting
of
a
special
election
date,
we
think
that
there
could
hardly
be
anything
which
is
more
clearly
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
regarding
an
election.
the
specific
language
of
the
statute
seems
to
cover
that.
the
prior
cases
of
this
court,
the
consistent
practice
of
the
united
states
department
of
justice,
the
potential
for
discrimination
that
resides
in
the
ability
to
set
an
election
date
with
essentially
no
standards,
no
guidance,
and
finally,
we
think
that--
mr.
armand
derfner
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
armand
derfner
okay.
the
question
is,
i
gather
you
are
asking
that
in
what
way
could
the
setting
of
an
election
date
be
discriminatory?
it
could
be
set
so
quickly
that
nonincumbents
had
no
right
to
campaign.
it
could
be
set
so
far
back
that
other
factors
intruded.
it
could
be
set
at
a
time
when
migrants...
and
there
are
migrants
in
hampton
county...
were
there
or
were
not
there.
it
could
be
set
at
a
time
when
students
were
there
or
not
there.
and
i
should
remark
that
in
the
last
two
categories,
there
have
been
cases
in
the
lower
courts,
not
from
south
carolina,
which
have
found
election
dates
to
be
discriminatory
because
of
those
reasons,
both
cases
from
texas,
as
i
recall.
so
there
is
a
lot
of
potential
for
discrimination
in
the
setting
of
a
date,
and
that
is
the
factor
which
leads
the
voting
rights
act
to
say
that
this
is
something
that
the
department
of
justice
ought
to
consider.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
although
in
this
case
the
section
5
inquiry
i
would
think
would
also
look
at
the
conditions
precedent
to
the
election,
specifically,
what
is
the
filing
period?
and
i
would
think
that
the
department
could
have
found
in
this
situation
that
holding
a
march
election
without
a
new
filing
period
would
make
that
election
date
itself
discriminatory.
so
there
are
a
world
of
ways.
i
should
say
that
the
appellees,
i
think
they
do
not
really
challenge
this
view
because
on
page
27
of
the
election...
i'm
sorry,
the
school
board's
brief,
they
say
we
agree...
they
agree,
in
effect,
that
an
election
date
set
by
statute
would
have
to
be
precleared,
and
they
seek
to
draw
an
exception
for
something
which
is
set
by
simple
administrative
decision.
i
would
think
that
there
is
certainly
no
exception,
that
this
court's
cases
have
dealt
with
administrative
decisions,
informal,
ad
hoc
decisions,
as
well
as
they
have
with
statutes,
and
in
fact,
if
anything
is
more
of
a
danger
under
the
voting
rights
act,
i
should
think
it
would
be
nonstatutory
changes.
as
to
the
filing
period,
as
to
the
filing
period,
i
think
it
is
equally
clear,
in
fact,
the
cases
of
this
court
make
it
clearer
because
the
very
first
couple
of
cases,
the
allen
case,
the
hadnott
case,
dealt
specifically
with
filing
periods.
so
i
think
there
could
hardly
be
an
argument
that
setting
a
filing
period
is
not
something
that
has
to
be
covered
by
section
5.
the
appellees
say,
though,
following
the
district
court,
that
in
this
case
the
attorney
general
did
preclear
the
filing
period
because
when
he
sent
his
letter
in
november
of
1982,
that
letter
precleared
act
549
which
had
an
august
filing
period,
and
they
said
that's
all
we
were
doing,
we
were
putting
that
same
filing
period
back--
but
the
attorney
general
says
that
he
didn't
preclear
that
filing
period;
he
says
that
he
precleared
an
august
filing
period
for
a
november
election,
and
i
think
that
the
attorney
general's
view,
first
of
all,
is
entitled
to
great
weight.
congress
has
given
him
great
weight.
this
court
has
always
accorded
his
views
great
weight.
moreover,
what
the
attorney
general
says
about
the
inseparability
of
filing
periods
and
elections
makes,
it
seems
to
me
to
make
all
the
sense
in
the
world.
if
you
said
that
a
filing
period
can
exist
in
the
abstract
without
being
tied
to
an
election
date,
then
i
suppose
we
could
have
a
situation,
to
use
an
example,
of
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
us
on
the
election
date
and
not
agree
with
us
on
the
filing
period,
we
could
conceivably
go
back.
the
district
court
could
order
a
new
election
in
1985,
and
the
appellees
could
come
back
and
say
fine,
we
will
still
use
the
1982
filing
period.
in
addition
to
the
attorney
general's
statement
with
which
we
agree
that
the
filing
period
was
attached
only
to
the
november
election,
and
that's
all
he
precleared,
we
think
there
is
another
reason
why
the
appellees
shouldn't
have
been
able
to
use
the
old
filing
period,
and
that
is
that
it
would
be
enforcing
a
filing
period
or
enforcing
an
act
at
a
time
when
the
act
we
believe
was
unenforceable
because
it
had
not
been
precleared.
this
is
a
problem
that
congress
has
addressed
most
clearly
in
the
most
recent
extension
of
the
act
because
congress
frankly
was
fed
up,
no
simpler
way
to
say
it
than
that,
was
fed
up
with
the
numerous
instances
of
premature
implementation
of
unprecleared
statutes.
the
statutory
language
says
unless
and
until,
and
that
is
not
what
happened
here
with
the
filing
period.
we
believe
the
district
court
made
some
broad
exceptions
to
section
5
in
this
case,
that
it
mischaracterized
the
attorney
general's
decision.
this
is,
with
all
due
respect,
the
third
year
in
a
row
that
this
court
has
been
faced
with
a
case
from
south
carolina
involving
much
the
same
situation.
exceptions
to
section
5
and
mischaracterizations
of
the
attorney
general's
decision
in
the
first
two
cases,
flanding
v.
dubose
and
mccain
v.
lybrand,
this
court
reversed
the
district
court
unanimously.
we
believe
this
case
is
equally
clear,
and
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
i
think
i
would,
justice
stevens,
because
while
it
is
true
that
there
have
been
a
number
of
instances
in
which
filing
periods
or
other
situations
have
gone
forward
without
somebody
suing
them,
i
think
the
law
is
clear
that
an
act
may
not
be
enforced,
and
what
you
have
is
citizens
who
read
the
that
voting
rights
act
says
nothing
can
be
enforced
until
it
is
precleared,
and
if
a
citizen
is
entitled
to
rely
on
the
law,
then
i
think
a
citizen
should
not
be
forced
to
the
choice
of
going
to
file
at
a
time
when
the
law
has
not
been
precleared.
so
if
what
you
are
saying
is
that--
mr.
armand
derfner
--we
don't
know...
no,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
stevens,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
what
the
attorney
general
was
advised
of
in
the
reconsideration.
and
i
have
looked
through
the
section
5
file
in
the
justice
department.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
what
the
attorney
general
knew
had
or
hadn't
happened
in
august.
i
have
to
think
that
the
attorney
general
is
entitled
to
rely
on
the
law
and
so
that
if
anything--
mr.
armand
derfner
--i
think
he
shouldn't
do
that.
if
he
did,
then
i
think
what
we
would
have
is
a
statute
that
is
found
by
the
constituted
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
be
nondiscriminatory,
but
i
think
we
would
still
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
equity
court
if
we
filed
a
lawsuit,
as
we
did
here,
and
say
that
because
there
was
a
procedural
violation,
we
think
it
is
unfair
to
have
gone
ahead,
and
therefore
we
are
entitled
to
relief.
i
am
not
sure
if
that
answers
the
question.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
armand
derfner
justice
o'connor,
no.
there
was
an
affidavit,
and
i
believe,
the
affidavit
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
unfortunately,
because
of
the
way
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
addressed
it
and
because
of
the
limited
record
on
that
issue,
i
frankly
am
bound
to
believe
that
that
case
really
isn't
appropriate
for
consideration
by
this
court
at
this
stage.
we
would
prefer
not
to
pursue
the
appeal
on
that
issue.
mr.
armand
derfner
what
was
precleared
was
the
abolition
of
the
position
as
of
this
coming
june,
and
so
that
it
in
fact,
if
the
court
were
to
decide
the
question,
it
would
be
moot
as
of
june.
what
there
were...
there
is
an
affidavit
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
in
practice
the
position
was
effectively
abolished
before
the
time
that
was
precleared,
but
that's
what
we
didn't
adequately--
mr.
armand
derfner
--my
suggestion,
frankly,
is
that
we
are...
i
would
prefer
not
to
pursue
that
portion
of
the
appeal
at
this
stage,
and
if
the
court
would
like,
i
might
even
be,
if
you
thought
it
appropriate,
i
could
dismiss
that
portion
of
the
appeal.
but
we
don't...
we
think
it
is
inappropriate
to
pursue
it
at
this
stage
based
on
the
record
that
we
have.
mr.
armand
derfner
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
have
a
point
or
two.
although
i
don't
think
it
is
the
central
issue
of
the
case,
the
issue
came
up
about
what
the
jurisdiction
was
doing
in
the
two
and
a
half
months,
and
obviously
there
is
no
record
of
that.
what
there
is,
what
there
is
a
file
of,
although
it
is
not
in
the
record
of
this
case,
is
the
submission
file,
which
is
here
on
five
microfiche
cards.
it
is
not
in
the
record.
and
frankly,
there
is
nothing
in

that
would
take
more
than
a
couple
of
hours
to
put
together.
thank
you
very
much.
