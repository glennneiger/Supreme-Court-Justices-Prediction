may
i
ask
just
one
question?
justice
stevens
supposing
the
attorney
general
had
cleared
the
act
549
in
october,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
stevens
but,
see,
presumably
if
that
had
happened,
the
attorney
general
would
have
known
the
filing
date,
and
he
was
advised
that
the
procedure
was
followed
that
you
did
follow,
that
you
told
them
to
register,
to
file
under
both
statutes.
justice
stevens
let
me
change
my
hypothetical.
supposing
he
was
fully
advised,
there
was
adequate
advice,
and
the
question
was
whether
he
could
then
approve
of
an
election
in
november
based
on
filings
that
had
taken
place
just
before
the
preclearance,
and
he
knew
all
about
what
had
happened.
