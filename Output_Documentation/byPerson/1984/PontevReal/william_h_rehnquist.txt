justice
rehnquist
counsel,
when
you
say
requirement
of
a
statement
of
reason,
you're
talking
about
a
requirement
that
the
administrative
record
before
the
prison
disciplinary
board
contain
a
statement
of
reasons
as
to
why
the
superintendent
refused
to
allow
a
witness
requested
by
the
prisoner
to
be
called?
justice
rehnquist
that
would
be
as
opposed
to
what
might
later
be
offered
in
a
1983
suit
where
the
prisoner
challenges
his
disciplinary
hearing,
reasons
advanced
at
that
time
by
the
state.
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
the
supreme
judicial
court
seems
to
have
held
that,
and
i
think
that's
contrary
to
the...
for
myself,
that's
contrary
to
the
language
in
wolff
and
in
baxter.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
state
is
going
further
here,
and
they
are
saying
not
only
do
we
not
have
to
supply
written
reasons
in
the
administrative
record
at
the
time
the
hearing
is
conducted
before
the
superintendent,
but
if
the
disciplinary
hearing
is
later
challenged
for
revocation
of
good
time
on
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
prisoner,
even
in
court
we
don't
have
to
advance
any
reason
why
the
superintendent
didn't
allow
these
witnesses
to
be
called.
and
i
think
you
run
into
a
little
trouble
with
some
of
the
language
in
wolff
there.
i
mean
to
say
you
don't
have
to
give
reasons
means
you
don't
have
to
give
reasons,
as
i
read
wolff,
at
the
time
of
the
disciplinary
hearings,
not
that
you
cannot
be
judicially
called
upon
later
to
give
reasons
in
a
particular
case.
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
levin,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
the
holding.
the
supreme
judicial
court
said
that
the
regulations
were
unconstitutional,
didn't
they?
justice
rehnquist
and
on
page
22,
they
said...
and
this
is
of
the
jurisdictional
statement:
"we
conclude
that
the
failure
of
the
regulations
to
require
some
support
in
the
record
for
the
denial
of
the
plaintiff's
witness
has
abridged
his
federal
due
process
right.
"
now,
if
you're
talking
about
regulations
issued
by
the
state
in
the
record,
i
presume
the
supreme
judicial
court
in
that
sense
was
referring
to
the
administrative
record.
justice
rehnquist
in
your
view
of
the
superior
court's
decision,
the
superior
court
would
have
had
no
occasion
to
set
aside
the
regulations
because
the
regulations
weren't
inconsistent
with
the
reasoning
of
the
superior
court.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
what
about
justice
o'connor's
suggestion
made
to
your
opponent,
that
perhaps
there
should
be
reasons
at
least
adduced
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
but
that
perhaps
those
reasons
should
be
submitted
in
camera
to
the
judge
just
because
of
the
very
volatility
of
the
prison
situation?
justice
rehnquist
that
would
be
pretty
coincidental,
though,
wouldn't
it,
when
the
record
happened
to
support
because
of
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses
or
something
else,
the
refusal
of
the...
or
due
to
the
record,
supplied
the
reasons
for
the
prison
officials'
refusal
to
call
the
witness.
justice
rehnquist
was
the
written
record
of
the
administrative
proceeding
produced
in
the
superior
court
in
this
case?
justice
rehnquist
so
at
least
the
administrative
report,
as
it's
now
done
in
massachusetts,
doesn't
have
a
transcript
of
testimony.
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
could
a
report
of
the
dimensions
of,
say,
that
on
page
14-a
ever,
except
by
sheerest
coincidence,
support
a
conclusion
that
witnesses
shouldn't
be
allowed?
