justice
white
what
was
the
theory
of...
his
theory
of
the
incident?
why
did
he
want
the
witnesses?
justice
white
the
decision
below
was
that
the
agency,
the
prison
had
to
put
in
the
administrative
record
a
reason.
justice
white
and
that
it
wouldn't
be
enough
if,
in
litigation,
the
state
offered
a
reason?
justice
white
so
that's
the
issue
we
have,
whether
at
the
time
they
must
give
an
explanation.
justice
white
he
asked
for
two
inmates.
justice
white
yes.
so
he
apparently
had
more...
other
witnesses
he
wanted
to
call.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
right.
okay.
justice
white
what
was
the
issue
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
was
it
the
prison
officials
had
wrongfully
denied
him
witnesses?
justice
white
did
you...
was
part
of
your
argument
in
the...
were
you
at
the
habeas
corpus?
justice
white
in
the
habeas
corpus?
justice
white
who
presented
the
argument,
or
who
made
the
argument
that
the
reason
for
denial
should
appear
in
the
administrative
record?
justice
white
but
that's
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
held.
justice
white
right.
well,
would
you...
if
you
had
been
representing
him
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
would
you
have
been
satisfied
if
the
state
had
said
well,
it's
true
that
the
administrative
record
doesn't...
that
no
reasons
were
given
orally
or
in
writing
at
the
administrative
hearing
or
in
connection
with
the
decision,
but
here's
the
reason
that
we
now
present
to
you
to
defend
this
charge
that
we
had
wrongfully
denied
witnesses.
would
you
have
been
satisfied
with--
justice
white
--well,
i
mean...
but
the
habeas
corpus
court
could
then
have
decided
whether
that
was
enough
of
a
reason
to
deny
witnesses.
justice
white
didn't
the
state
ever
give
a
reason?
justice
white
but
the
district
court
said
that...
also
held
there
should
be
reasons
given
at
the
administrative
hearing.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
right.
but
that's...
as
it
came
out
in
the
supreme
judicial
court:
"we
find
persuasive
the
requirement
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
there
must
be
some
support
in
the
administrative
record
to
justify
a
decision
not
to
call--
"
justice
white
well,
but
that's
the
basis
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
decided
it.
justice
white
in
the
supreme
judicial
court's
opinion?
justice
white
well,
it
affirmed
the
judgment
for
the
reasons
given
by
the
supreme
judicial
court.
justice
white
didn't
wolff...
do
i
recall
wolff
right?
it
said
that
the
prison
administration
could
deny
the
witnesses
if
it
would
jeopardize
institutional
safety
or
correctional
goals.
is
that
what
it
said?
justice
white
well,
would
it
be
enough
to
satisfy
the
constitution,
in
your
view,
if
the
superintendent
said,
or
the
decision-maker
in
the
prison
said
we
deny
these
witnesses
because
in
our
view,
calling
these
witnesses
would
jeopardize
institutional
safety,
period?
justice
white
they
then
have
to
explain
their
judgment
that
institutional
safety
would
be--
justice
white
--no,
it
wouldn't
be
meaningless.
at
least
it
would
show
that
the
prison
official
knows
what
the
standard
is
and
has
thought
that
his
position
complied
with
the
standard.
it
wouldn't
be
a
mindless
act
anyway.
justice
white
so
a
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
that
institutional
decision
was
rational
or
not.
justice
white
yeah,
but
wolff
didn't
say
that...
wolff
gave
the
standard,
but
it
didn't
say
that
the
official
had
to
explain
it
in
detail.
justice
white
well,
it
isn't
entirely
a
fruitless
matter
to
inquire
whether
you
knew
what
the
law
was
and
whether
you
applied
the
right
standard
in
denying.
that's
frequently
the
only
question
there
is.
justice
white
and
at
least
the
official
could
evidence
that
he
knew
what
the
law
was
and
give
his
opinion
that
we
looked
at
the
evidence,
we
looked
at
the
situation
and
thought
that
the
witnesses
could
be
denied
under
the
standard.
