justice
o'connor
mr.
levin,
there
were
no
reason
given
by
the
disciplinary
board
for
its
refusal
to
allow
any
of
the
witnesses
to
be
called?
justice
o'connor
and
at
the
subsequent
habeas
hearing
in
the
state
trial
court,
is
it
correct
that
the
state
at
that
time
offered
no
reason,
no
subsequent
reason
or
explanation?
justice
o'connor
well,
in
addition
to
no
evidence,
as
i
understand
that,
and
i
want
you
to
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
the
attorney
for
the
state
offered
no
explanation
at
all.
justice
o'connor
so,
on
the
surface
then,
the
defendant
may
have
had
some
plausible
excuse
for
his
failure
to
immediately
leave
the
scene,
and
yet
the
reviewing
court
has
no
opportunity
at
all
to
understand
the
reason
why
he
wasn't
allowed
to
call
witnesses.
is
that
right?
is
that
the
posture
in
which
we
review
the
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
all
i
was
asking
for.
counsel,
what,
in
your
view,
would
the
prisoner
have
to
show
to
trigger
some
duty
to
respond
at
the
habeas
hearing
in
state
court?
justice
o'connor
could
a
showing
ever
be
made,
in
your
view,
on
an
individual
case
that
it
was
needed
just
for
evidence
and
there
was
no
valid
excuse
no
discrimination
alleged,
no
overall
policy
alleged?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
the
case
of
hughes
v.
roe
has
any
relevance
for
our
purposes
here
in
indicating
that
in
the
absence
of
some
indication
on
the
record
that
concern
for
safety
of
witnesses,
for
example,
or
other
prisoners
was
a
concern
that
the
state
has
to
offer
at
least
an
explanation
of
some
kind?
justice
o'connor
--well,
i
suppose
that
a
procedure
whereby
some
kind
of
explanation
is...
contemporaneous
explanation
would
be
made
by
the
disciplinary
board,
but
in
every
case
perhaps
kept
confidential
so
that
it
could
be
reviewed
by
any
subsequent
court
in
camera.
is
that
procedure
unworkable?
justice
o'connor
so
that
it
isn't
reviewed
at
all
by
the
prisoner.
