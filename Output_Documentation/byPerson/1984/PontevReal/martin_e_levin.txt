mr.
martin
e.
levin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
a
relatively
narrow
issue,
and
that
is
whether
chapter
103
of
the
code
of
massachsetts
regulations,
section
430.14
fails
to
satisfy
the
due
process
clause
because
it
does
not
require
a
prison
disciplinary
board
to
state
its
reasons
in
the
record
for
denying
an
inmate's
request
for
witnesses
at
his
disciplinary
hearing.
i
will
argue
that
the
regulation
wholly
comports
with
due
process,
and
that
imposing
the
additional
procedural
requirement
of
a
statement
of
reasons
imposes
unjustified
burdens
on
the
prison
administration.
i
will
also
address
the
issue
of
mootness
that
has
been
raised
by
the
respondent.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
as
to
why
the
disciplinary
board
refused
to
allow
that
request.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
correct,
your
honor.
the
massachusetts
department
of
correction
has
adopted
regulations
governing
the
procedures
used
at
prison
disciplinary
hearings
which
track,
virtually
word
for
word,
this
court's
holding
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell.
the
particular
regulation
at
issue
here,
section
430.14,
provides
that
an
inmate
does
have
a
right
to
call
witnesses
at
his
disciplinary
hearing
except
where
that
right
conflicts
with
the
prison
official's
interest
in
seeing
that
the
hearing
does
not
create
undue
hazards
within
the
institution
or
otherwise
undermine
correctional
goals.
the
regulation
further
provides
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
allow
an
inmate's
request
for
witnesses,
the
board
is
to
consider
such
factors
as
relevance,
necessity,
the
cumulative
nature
of
the
testimony
to
be
given,
and
the
hazards
present
in
a
particular
case.
the
regulation
does
not
require
the
board
to
state
its
reasons
or
provide
support
in
the
record
for
its
decision
to
deny
an
inmate's
request
for
witnesses.
of
course,
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
and
again
in
baxter
v.
palmigiano,
this
court
rejected
the
notion
that
due
process
requires
such
a
statement
of
reasons.
in
this
case,
john
real
who
was
a
prisoner
at
the
maximum
security
institution
in
massachusetts,
was
charged
with
three
violations
of
the
massachusetts
code
of
disciplinary
offenses.
those
charges
stem
from
an
incident
in
which
mr.
real,
contrary
to
an
order
of
a
correctional
officer
named
john
baleyko,
entered
an
office
within
the
prison
in
which
mr.
baleyko
was
attempting
to
stop
another
inmate's
attack
on
another
officer.
at
his
disciplinary
hearing,
mr.
real
requested
that
john
balayko,
the
reporting
officer,
the
officer
who
authored
the
disciplinary
report,
be
called
as
a
witness.
mr.
baleyko
was
called
and
he
testified
t
the
particulars
of
the
offenses
charged.
john
real
also
requested
that
two
inmates
be
called
as
witnesses.
that
request
was
denied
and
no
reason
for
the
denial
appears
in
the
administrative
record.
the
disciplinary
board
found
that
john--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--well,
your
honor,
that'
not
clear
from
the
record
as
to
why...
why
those
witnesses
were
requested.
in
the
record
it
reflects
that,
although
mr.
real
did
not
contest
that
he
entered
the
office
contrary
so
the
order
of
the
correctional
officer,
that
on
subsequent
orders
he
was
trying
to
leave,
and
that
incoming
officers
stopped
him
from
leaving
to
shake
him
down,
as
he--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--well,
your
honor,
that
may
be
a
good
statement
in
mitigation,
but
in
fact
what
occurred
here
was
the
officer
did
issue
an
order
which
was
not
obeyed
under
circumstances
in
which
immediate
obedience
was
necessary.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
he...
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
particulars
of
the
record,
but
our
position
basically
is
that
under
the
circumstances,
in
fact,
when
the
officer
had
indeed
ordered
him
not
to
come
in
in
the
first
place,
and
he
did
not
comply
with
that
order,
although
a
number
of
other
inmates
whom
he
was
with
did,
was
sufficient
disobedience
of
an
order,
especially
under
circumstances
such
as
these
in
which
an
assault
was
taking
place,
to
constitute
the
offenses
charged.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
there
was
no
evidence
presented
by
the
state
at
that
hearing.
basically,
it's
our
position
that
at
that
point,
under
the
constitution,
the
judge
had--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
no
explanation
offered.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
your
honor,
the
reviewing
court
did,
i
believe,
have
the
administrative
record
which
reflected
what
was
before
the
prison
disciplinary
board
during
the
prison
disciplinary
proceedings.
it's
our
position
that,
given
the
guidance
of
wholly
proper
procedures
under
these
circumstances
and
the
discretion
of
the
board
to
properly
deny
witnesses,
based
on
the
factors
that
are
laid
out
in
those
regulations,
and
the
failure
of
mr.
real
to
state
any
or
make
any
showing
that
the
board
failed
to
follow
those
procedures,
that
it
was
wholly
within
the
discretion
of
the
board
to
make
that
determination,
and
that
in
fact
at
the
hearing
before
the
judge,
there
was
no
reason
why
correctional
authorities
had
to
come
forward
at
that
point
with
their
reason.
there
basically
was
no
prima
facie
showing
by
the
plaintiff
at
that
time
which
would
necessitate
answer...
excuse
me...
with
respect
to
that
issue.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
that
it
was
a
lawful
order?
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
there
has
never
been
any
issue
raised
in
the
case
that
the
guard
didn't
have
the
authority
to
order
real
to
stay
out
of
the
office
at
that
time.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
whether
or
not
the
officer
has--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--whether
or
not
the
officer
has
to
give
a
reason
to
a
prisoner,
in
general--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--well,
under
these
circumstances,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
guard
did
have
to
give
any
reasons.
and,
in
fact,
this
case
is
a
prime
example
of--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--to
the
court?
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
the
reasons
for
the
order,
the
reasons
for
the
charge
of
the
offense
in
the
first
place,
were
before
the
court
in
the
administrative
record
and
the
disciplinary
report.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
the
guard
was
in
a
prison
office,
an
office
within
the
prison,
trying
to
stop
another
inmate's
attack
on
another
guard.
that's
what
the
record
shows.
a
group
of
inmates
from
a
shop,
a
prison
shop
next
door,
began
to
enter
the
office.
the
guard,
naturally,
said
don't
come
into
this
office.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
that's
in
the
administrative
record.
that's
in
the
disciplinary
report.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
your
honor,
in
some
of
the
lower
federal
courts
in
successful
actions
under
these
circumstances,
what
prisoners
did
show,
for
example,
was
that
there
was
a
persistent
practice
on
the
part
of
prison
officials
to
never
allow
an
inmate
to
call
a
witness.
certainly,
if
an
inmate
could
make
a
prima
facie
showing,
for
example,
that
the
prison
officials
were
acting
on
a
discriminatory
basis
with
respect
to
their
decisions,
that
would
be
a
showing
that
prison
officials
were
not
properly
exercising
their
discretion.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
your
honor,
in
the
first
place,
it's
our
position
that
the
necessity
with
respect
to
the
evidence
is
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
the
inquiry
also
has
to
go
to,
as
this
court
considered
in
wolff,
to
what
kinds
of
risks
would
be
involved
in
bringing
that
witness
into
the
disciplinary
hearing
room.
second,
with
respect
to
your
answer
about
the
individual
case,
certainly
one
can
hypothesize
situations
in
which
a
prison
inmate
could
make
allegations
and
prove
through
evidence
that
there
was
some
systematic
discrimination
against
him
or
some
plot
on
the
part
of
prison
officials
to
set
him
up,
and
that
this
was
part
of
an
ongoing
plot.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
hughes
v.
roe
is
applicable
in
this
case
or
provides
much
guidance.
in
hughes,
of
course,
an
inmate
had
alleged
that
he
was
placed
into
segregation
without
any
prior
hearing
whatsoever,
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
sufficient
to
survive
a
rule
12(b)(6)
motion
to
dismiss.
under
subsequent
case
law,
helms
v.
hewitt,
decided
by
this
case,
it
was
made
plain
that
under
these
circumstances,
a
liberty
interest
might
be
implicated
and
an
inmate
might
be
entitled
to
a
bearing.
that
kind
of
a
scenario
is
much...
the
scenario
where
an
inmate
may
not
have
a
hearing
where
liberty
interest
is
implicated,
may
not
have
a
hearing
at
all,
we
submit
is
quite
distinct
from
the
situation
such
as
this
where
there
is
no
question
that
mr.
real
received
his
hearing.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
prison
disciplinary
board
failed
to
follow
what,
on
their
face,
were
fully
adequate
procedures,
and
where
this
court
has
indeed
held
that
the
prisoner
doesn't
have
the
right
to
have
a
statement
of
reasons,
which
is
exactly
the
right
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
held
that
he
did
have.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
contest
that
in
the
individual
case,
in
a
later
judicial
proceeding
to
review
the
action
of
prison
officials,
that
where
the
prisoner
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
that
he's
been
denied
his
procedural
rights,
that
prison
officials
are
going
to
have
to
answer
that
case
as
they
would
in
any
other
habeas
corpus
case
or
a
1983
case.
our
position
is
merely
that
where
a
prisoner
simply
goes
into
court
and
says
i
didn't
get
a
witness,
under
this
court's
ruling
in
wolff
that's
not
enough
because,
especially
under
these
circumstances
in
massachusetts
where
the
procedures
which
prison
officials
follow
are
exactly
those
procedures
prescribed
in
wolff,
the
prison
disciplinary
board
has
that
very
discretion
to
say
you
can
request
the
witness
but
we
can
deny
it,
and
we
don't
have
to
tell
you
why.
so
that
it
seems
anomalous,
just
as
a
matter
of
pleading,
to
have
a
prisoner
go
into
court
and
say,
well,
it
did
exactly
what
they're
entitled
to
do
under
the
constitution
and
under
their
regulations,
but
i
want
to
know
more,
i
want
them
to
answer
me
more;
i
want
them
to
justify
themselves.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
fairly
unprecedented
just
by
virtue
of
general
rules
of
pleading,
and--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--well,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
we
draw
no
distinction.
we
would
argue
that
he
would
have
to
go
further
than
that,
because
in
fact
all
he's
arguing...
and
this
court
did
consider
the
fact
that
presentation
of
witnesses
is
generally
a
requirement
of
a
procedurally
fair
hearing
in
wolff.
and
under
wolff,
even
with
respect
to
those
considerations,
it
was
deemed
that
the
concerns
for
prison
security
and
correctional
goals
were
so
great
as
to
override
that
right,
and
basically
if
the
officials
are
guided
by
proper
considerations,
as
here
they
were
under
the
procedures,
allow
them
the
discretion
to
be
sure
that
hazards--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
that
was,
most
certainly,
the
decision
below,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
thank
you.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
to
resume
with
my
response
to
justice
white's
question,
in
fact
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
did
hold
in
this
case
is
that
the
statement
of
reasons
to
be
given
is
to
be
given
in
the
administrative
record
at
the
disciplinary
hearing.
now,
this
court
has
recently
stated
in
olim
v.
wakinekona
that
procedures
do
not
exist
in
a
vacuum.
they
are
not
to
be
valued
in
and
of
themselves,
but
they
exist
for
a
purpose,
and
that
is
to
protect
some
substantive
right;
in
this
case,
it's
the
inmate's
substantive
right
or
substantive
liberty
interest
in
statutory
good
time.
furthermore,
this
court
has
noted
that
in
fashioning
its
procedural
prescriptions,
prescriptions
required
by
the
constitution,
it
is
concerned
that
government
officials
be
guided
by
adequate
procedures
in
the
generality
of
cases,
and
not
with
whether,
when
guided
by
such
procedures,
officials
make
a
decision
with
which
a
court
might
later
disagree.
in
this
case,
the
procedure
prescribed
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
does
not
really
bear
any
relation
to
these
principles.
the
procedural
requirement
of
a
statement
of
reasons
is
primarily
focused
on
safeguarding,
if
you
will,
another
procedural
requirement;
that
is,
the
requirement
of
the
right
to
call
witnesses,
that
qualified
right
that
this
court
enunciated
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell.
furthermore,
and
equally
as
important,
the
impetus
of
the
supreme
judicial
court's
decision
was
that
it
wanted
a
record
that
it
could
review
basically
on
a
case-by-case
basis
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
agreed
with
what
prison
officials
were
doing.
such
a
holding
is
not
warranted
by
the
principles
set
forth
by
this
court
in
its
due
process,
procedural
due
process
cases.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
your
honor,
i'd
have
to
page
through
the
opinion
to
find
the
exact
spot,
but
i
am
confident
that
even
though
they
noted
that
there
was
no
statement
of
reasons
given,
either
at
the
hearing
or
later,
the
ruling
was
that
the
statement
of
reason
should
come
at
the
point
of
the
disciplinary
hearing
and
not
be
what
they
considered
to
be
a
post
hac
rationalization.
they
relied
on
hayes
ii.
i
forget
just
now
whether
that
was
hayes
v.
thompson
or
hayes
v.
walker,
but
the
case
that's
referred
to
in
both
our
brief
and
the
respondent's
as
hayes
ii.
and
in
that
case,
in
that
very
case,
exactly
what
happened
was
that
in
accordance
with
this
court's
ruling
in
wolff,
a
prison
disciplinary
board
denied
a
request
for
witnesses.
there
was
little
or
no
statement
of
reasons
in
the
record.
the
case
before
the
trial
court
included
evidence
put
in
by
prison
officials
upon
which
the
trial
court
determined
that
there
was
no
arbitrary
deprivation
of
the
right
to
call
witnesses.
but
in
that
case,
the
seventh
circuit
reversed,
stating
that
we
want
this
statement
in
the
record.
and,
although
i
don't
have
at
my
fingertips
the
page
number
now--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--well,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that
it
is
the
same
issue.
i
believe
justice
o'connor
and
some
of
the
other
justices
were
questioning
us
about
some
of
the
pleading
implications,
basically,
of
our
position;
what
position
were
we
taking
with
respect
to
the
burden
to
go
forward
really
in
pleading.
and
we
don't
contest
that
certainly
an
inmate
has
a
right
to
bring
a
1983
case
or
a
petition--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--well,
your
honor,
both.
on
this
record,
there
was
no
constitutional
violation.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
certainly
not.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
exactly
the
portion
of
the
opinion
to
which
i
was
just
referring.
our
reading
of
that
holding
is
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
held
these
regulations
unconstitutional
because
they
did
not
require
a
statement
of
reasons
in
the
administrative
record.
now,
we
have
noted
in
our
brief
several
reasons
why
we're
most
concerned
about
this
new
requirement
imposed
by
the
supreme
judicial
court,
and
i
would
just
like
to
highlight
this
afternoon
one
or
two
of
them.
the
most
serious
cases,
of
course,
are
those
cases
in
which
the
calling
of
a
witness
may
create
hazards
within
the
institution
because
the
witness
may
be
subject
to
reprisal,
generally
by
the
charged
inmate.
in
such
cases
where
we
have
a
requirement,
an
across-the-board
requirement
of
a
statement
of
reasons,
the
prison
disciplinary
board
is
basically
put
into
the
position
of
trying
to
guess
how
much
it
can
put
in
the
record,
how
much
must
it
put
in
the
record
without
running
the
very
risk
that
it
hopes
to
avoid
by
not
calling
the
witness
in
the
first
place.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
under
the
ruling
in
wolff,
the
record
is
to
be
shown
to
the
inmate
and
is
to
include
those
factors
that
is
required
by
the
court
under
the
constitution.
i'm
not
quite
certain
what
purpose
it
would
serve
as
far
as
the
rationale
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
is
concerned
to
have
it
otherwise.
principally,
when
the
court
was
concerned
that
the
board
state
at
the
outset
to
the
knowledge
of
the
inmate
why
it
is
that
the
requested
witness
was
denied--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--no,
no.
but
to
the
extent
that
a
record
was
required
and
that
record
went
to
the
evidence
on
which
the
board
relied
and
the
reasons
for
sanctions
to
he
given,
it's
my
reading
that
that
was
the
record
that
would
be
available
to
the
inmate.
furthmore,
we
run
into
a
problem
where
we
have
an
across-the-board
rule,
and
the
only
time
the
inmate
can't
know
is
when,
in
fact,
there's
a
risk
of
reprisal.
then
the
only
time
the
inmate
doesn't
know
is
exactly...
will
lead
to
exactly
the
same
result.
that
is,
the
arousal
of
the
suspicions
in
the
inmate's
mind
which
can
lead
to
the
physical
retaliation
that
is
trying
to
be
avoided.
and
we
submit
that
in
fact
this
requirement
leads
to
exactly
that
position
that
the
respondent
himself
has
suggested
at
page
32
of
his
brief.
that
is,
it
puts
prison
officials
in
the
position
of
making
a
decision
between
forgoing
an
otherwise
proper
and
necessary
disciplinary
action
within
the
institution
or
revealing
sensitive
information
which
can
lead
to
harm
within
the
institution.
now,
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
is
not
here
to
play
the
heavy,
and
we're
not
here
to
say
the
constitution
doesn't
accompany
these
individuals
once
they
step
into
the
jailhouse
door.
but
we
don't
believe
that
this
court's
ruling
in
wolff
or
in
baxter
or
in
the
recent
cases
of
hudson
v.
palmer
or
block
v.
rutherford
or
hewitt
v.
helm
contemplate
that
the
constitution
is
going
to
require
that
prison
officials
be
put
in
that
kind
of
a
position.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
going
to
say
it's
unworkable.
but--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--there
are
certain
drawbacks
to
that
procedure
which
are
inherent
in
the
procedure
in
general.
one,
in
dealing
with
these
cases,
we
wish
to
stress,
as
judge
friendly
said
in
his
article,
some
kind
of
hearing
that
we're
dealing
with
a
system
of
mass
justice,
and
that
prison
officials
in
massachusetts,
for
example,
in
1980
had
almost
7,000
disciplinary
proceedings
at
which
prisoners
were
entitled
to
the
full
procedural
safeguards,
presumably
as
you
suggested,
which
would
include
an
extended
record,
although
that
record
would
be
confidential.
now,
this
may
not
seem
like
much
in
the
context
of
any
one
disciplinary
proceeding,
but
when
you
add
this
up
you're
talking
about
man
hours
and
you're
talking
about
resources
that
come
out
of
other
areas
within
the
prison.
i
see
that
my
time
is
growing
short,
and
i
do
want
to
address
the
issue
of
mootness
because
i
promised
that
i
would,
and
i
don't
want
to
break
my
promise.
during
the
disciplinary
action
involved
in
this
case,
mr.
real
was
in
the
state
prison
on
a
three
t
five-year
sentence
for
possession
of
a
sawed-off
shotgun.
in
november
of
1982,
the
commissioner
of
correction
issued
a
certificate
of
discharge
from
that
sentence
and
he
made
the
discharge
effective
to
july
19,
1982
because
of
certain
recalculations
in
good
time
credit.
from
that
date,
from
the
july
19th
date,
mr.
real
was
deemed
to
have
begun
serving
a
five-year
from
and
after
sentence
imposed
for
a
manslaughter
offense
he
committed
while
in
prison,
killing
another
inmate.
now,
the
respondent
has
suggested
that
this
case
is
now
moot
because
mr.
real
has
received
the
certificate
of
discharge
from
the
three
to
five-year
sentence,
that
is,
the
sentence
to
which
the
good
time
at
issue
would
apply.
but
that's
clearly
not
the
case,
because
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court,
returning
the
150
days
good
time
to
mr.
real,
his
effective
date
of
discharge
then
becomes
some
time
in
february
1982.
the
running
of
his
five-year
from
and
after
sentence
is
from
that
date,
and
mr.
real
ceases
to
be
in
massachusetts
custody
in
february
of
1987,
rather
than
in
july
of
1987.
mr.
real
clearly
has
a
concrete
interest
in
this
case
which
presents
the
court
with
a
justiciable
controversy.
if
i
might,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
thank
you.
mr.
martin
e.
levin
your
honor,
just
to
address
justice
white's
question.
again,
i'd
like
to
stress
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
record
that
indicated
that
prison
officials
were
unaware
of
what
the
law
was,
that
the
issue
here
had
to
do
with
the
procedure
that
massachusetts
had
adopted,
and
there
was
never
any
showing
that
officials
did
not
know
what
that
procedure
was
or
failed
to
follow
that
procedure.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions--
mr.
martin
e.
levin
--there
is
no
explanation
of
that
expressly
in
the
record.
thank
you.
